<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE The COUNTESS of NORTHINGTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following Sermons were preached before, and are therefore, with all due re&s;pect, dedicated to your Lady&s;hip: Di&s;|cour&s;es on the <HI>relative duties</HI> could not indeed be addre&s;&s;ed with &s;o much propriety to any one, as to her who is &s;o eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
for the con&s;tant and regu|lar performance of them. The &s;ubjects are of great and univer&s;al concern: I flatter my&s;elf there|fore, that the important nature of the plan will in a great mea&s;ure palliate all defects in the execu|tion of it.</P>
<P>In an age of luxury and di&s;&s;i|pation, when family duties are &s;o generally neglected, the <HI>Charac|ters</HI> &s;ubjoined to each di&s;cour&s;e may perhaps be thought merely ideal, and &s;uch as are rather to be wi&s;h'd for than found among&s;t us; with regard to &s;ome of them I had notwith&s;tanding the advan|tage of looking up to a <HI>living
<PB N="v" REF="6">
example:</HI> tho&s;e who are unac|quainted with your character, and tho&s;e only need be told, that the good <HI>parent, wife,</HI> and <HI>mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> are but three &s;everal portraitures, drawn in different attitudes, of Lady NORTHINGTON: for the truth of this I appeal to one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t equitable Jud|ges in this kingdom: I believe there is not a per&s;on in it who will not in this, as in every other point, readily abide by <HI>his</HI> deter|mination.</P>
<P>That Lord NORTHINGTON, your&s;elf, and family, may long enjoy that dome&s;tic happine&s;s which is the genuine fruit and
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
be&s;t reward of dome&s;tic virtue, in uninterrupted health and pro&s;pe|rity, is the &s;incere wi&s;h of,</P>

<P>AS Happine&s;s is the end and de|&s;ign of our being,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. I.</NOTE> the <HI>land flowing with milk and honey,</HI> which all men are in &s;earch of, it is doubtle&s;s our bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire which is the be&s;t and plaine&s;t road, and that will mo&s;t infallibly conduct us to it; and in this important concern we cannot be too cautious, becau&s;e when once we
<PB N="2" REF="9">
enter into a wrong path, every &s;tep we take plunges us &s;till deeper into error. So fatal is the influence of bad example, &s;o &s;tubborn are the prejudices contracted in our earlier years, that it is too often half the bu&s;ine&s;s of life to unlearn their fooli&s;h le&s;&s;ons, and &s;hake off the bur|then which they have impo&s;ed on us: the pomp and lu&s;tre of riches and grandeur &s;o dazzle the young and unex|perienced mind, that it is no wonder it a&s;&s;ociates with <HI>them</HI> the idea of hap|pine&s;s; though, in reality, no two things are in their natures more di&s;tinct or more e&s;&s;entially different from each other, as would evidently appear to him who, but for a moment, would place before him the following nece&s;&s;ary and indi&s;putable truth.</P>
<P>IF the wi&s;e and good Creator de&s;igned that all men &s;hould be happy, (and to &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e were to impeach his goodne&s;s) we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured he would
<PB N="3" REF="10">
not have confined that bli&s;s, which he graciou&s;ly intended for all, within the reach only of a few; mere externals there|fore can never con&s;titute true felicity.</P>
<P>WITHOUT &s;ubordination, without different degrees of rank and preceden|cy, the world would be a &s;cene of anar|chy and confu&s;ion; &s;ome con&s;equently mu&s;t be richer, &s;ome more powerful, &s;ome wi&s;er than the re&s;t; but from hence to infer, that tho&s;e al&s;o mu&s;t be happier, is an idle and a groundle&s;s conclu&s;ion; a conclu&s;ion, which every hour's expe|rience de&s;troys, an argument, which even the weake&s;t rea&s;oner might con|fute.</P>
<P>IT is indeed with the minds as with the bodies of men; whatever is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the health and tran|quillity of either is equally attainable by all; but when needle&s;s delicacies are &s;ought for to plea&s;e the one, and
<PB N="4" REF="11">
vi&s;ionary refinements to delight the other, then imaginary wants grow up into real misfortunes, and the lo&s;s of ideal happine&s;s creates &s;en&s;ible and la&s;t|ing mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>BETTER, &s;ays Solomon, <HI>is a dinner of herbs where love is than a &s;talled ox, and hatred therewith</HI>; that is, it is better to be happy than to appear &s;o. The maxim inculcated in my text is the ob&s;ervation of the wi&s;e&s;t of the &s;ons of men, not the declamatory &s;atire of a di&s;contented indigent phi|lo&s;opher, who (as philo&s;ophers indeed u&s;ed) railed at tho&s;e riches which he could not acquire, but the &s;ober di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate reflection of a potent mo|narch, of one who had opportunity to favor, power to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and, above all, wi&s;dom to direct him in his &s;earch after happine&s;s: he was well acquainted with the temptations of ambition, and no &s;tranger to tho&s;e cares and di&s;ap|pointments,
<PB N="5" REF="12">
which &s;o con&s;tantly attend its votaries: he knew too well of what &s;orry &s;tuff the idol was made ever to fall down and wor&s;hip it; he had ta&s;ted that poi&s;on of hatred which <HI>embitters</HI> the fea&s;t of life: he had been ble&s;t in that love which <HI>&s;weetens</HI> and endears it. So|lomon, we &s;ee, in the mid&s;t of affluence and grandeur, even in the bo&s;om of plenty and pro&s;perity, prefers the calm undi&s;turbed enjoyment of dome&s;tic bli&s;s, with peace and harmony, to the pomp of maje&s;ty, and all the plea&s;ures of a crown, without them; and the greate&s;t epicure mu&s;t own, when he made choice of love, he invited a nobler gue&s;t to grace his table, than even that queen, who came &s;o far to vi&s;it him; he cho&s;e a gue&s;t, who, though he tarry but a day, can give more real entertainment, and more &s;olid &s;atisfaction, than all the croud of idle vi&s;itants, who loiter round the great, and &s;well the bubble of a court.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="13">BETTER <HI>is a dinner of herbs where love is than a &s;talled ox and hatred therewith</HI>; or, in other words, it is better to have a moderate competency with the plea|&s;ures of mutual love, and an agreeable intercour&s;e with tho&s;e, whom we value and e&s;teem, than va&s;t accumulated wealth joined to profu&s;ion and extra|vagance, together with that hatred, &s;trife, and envy, which &s;o frequently accompany them. There is not perhaps a &s;et of beings more truly unhappy than tho&s;e we fal&s;ely term the great; who&s;e pomp we &s;ee, but do not know their &s;orrows; &s;o true is it, that a <HI>man's riches do not con&s;i&s;t in the abundance</HI>; not in the quantity, but in the quality <HI>of what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth:</HI> &s;en&s;ible was the reply of the philo&s;opher to the reproach ca&s;t on his &s;mall cottage; &s;mall as it is, &s;aid he, would to heaven, I could fill it with real friends! The highe&s;t &s;en&s;ual gra|tifications (and &s;o the voluptuous man
<PB N="7" REF="14">
him&s;elf will own) quickly pall the ap|petite, unle&s;s heightened and improved by &s;ocial plea&s;ures; by that double en|joyment which we reap from another's participation of it; and hence it ari&s;eth, that all the re&s;tle&s;s &s;ons of avarice and ambition, all the mo&s;t unwearied pur|&s;uers after power and fame, find in their &s;hort moments of reflection a cruel void aching in their hearts: even tho&s;e who pretend to hate mankind, and tho&s;e who &s;hun it, would &s;till be glad to fix &s;ome friend&s;hips, to form &s;ome con|nections, to have a haven of re&s;t to re|tire to, a home to &s;helter them&s;elves in, and a fea&s;t of love to partake of.</P>
<P>IT is a certain &s;ign of a vitiated &s;tomach, when nothing but a variety of co&s;tly viands, with high and luxurious provocatives, can rai&s;e the &s;ickly appe|tite; when we &s;ee men therefore run abroad after every gaudy &s;cene, and em|brace every fooli&s;h public entertainment,
<PB N="8" REF="15">
it is a &s;hrewd &s;ign they are not very fond of home; if their <HI>trea&s;ure</HI> was there, <HI>there would their hearts be</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>WHEN the body langui&s;hes under any &s;ecret lurking di&s;temper, it is always re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y; perpetually &s;hifting its po&s;ition, though every altered mo|tion gives fre&s;h pain and di&s;quietude; and thus it is, I fear, with the mind al&s;o; which, once deprived of that ea&s;e and quiet, on which its health and happine&s;s depend, is ever &s;eeking after new objects to divert its angui&s;h, and deceive it into a momentary and fal&s;e tranquillity.</P>
<P>SINCE then, neither that virtue which be&s;tows peace, nor that innocence which alone can pre&s;erve it, are in the gift of fortune, fame, or power; &s;ince they are not to be &s;ought for in the noi&s;e and bu&s;tle of a venal world, but in our own brea&s;ts; &s;ince it is not the <HI>&s;talled ox,</HI> the
<PB N="9" REF="16">
pride and lu&s;tre of life, which con&s;titute true felicity, but the <HI>dinner of herbs where love is</HI>; &s;ince it is this which &s;heds comfort on the lowe&s;t &s;tation, and without which the highe&s;t mu&s;t be mi&s;erable, how careful ought we to be in pre&s;erving, &s;trengthening, and improving that love and union, that peace and quietne&s;s, on which our happine&s;s does &s;o immediately depend!</P>
<P>THAT God has implanted in every brea&s;t a principle of love and benevo|lence, is an indi&s;putable truth, which calls for the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of gratitude to our creator; and le&s;t that principle &s;hould, like a drop of rain falling into the ocean, lo&s;e it&s;elf in a multiplicity of objects, God hath thought fit to direct it, as it were, into proper channels; to confine it by in&s;eparable connections, by the ties of kindred, and the bonds of natural affection; from this fountain flow all tho&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="17">
dome&s;tic &s;weets, which alleviate the cares and inhance the ble&s;&s;ings of life, tho&s;e &s;ocial duties, tho&s;e tender rela|tions, which act a double part, and whil&s;t they make us happy here in the di&s;charge of them, recommend us at the &s;ame time to the Almighty, and &s;ecure our future and everla&s;ting hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN it depends intirely on our|&s;elves with whom we will &s;pend our days (a happine&s;s which but very few can boa&s;t) we naturally attach our|&s;elves to tho&s;e, from who&s;e imagined worth we have rea&s;on to expect the warme&s;t returns; but experience con|vinces us how frequent and how fatal are the errors of our choice: we &s;ee through a gla&s;s, which pre&s;ents objects to us not only darkly but fal&s;ely. Some qualities dazzle by a &s;pecious lu&s;tre, others allure by a &s;eeming &s;olidity; gravity pa&s;&s;es on us for wi&s;dom, and
<PB N="11" REF="18">
vivacity for wit; and we too often find, that, in&s;tead of an amiable companion, and a prudent coun&s;ellor, we have linked our&s;elves to an idle je&s;ter, or a conceal'd villain; here, indeed, &s;elf-love commands and religion warrants a retreat; if the friend, on whom we re|lied, &s;tart a&s;ide, <HI>like a broken bow,</HI> we are at liberty to leave him, and &s;eek a &s;urer defence; but the ca&s;e is far other|wi&s;e, when we are tied down by con|nections, bound by &s;olemn obligations, by nature and by religion, to duties we cannot &s;hake off or &s;et light by.</P>
<P>THE fretfulne&s;s and &s;everity of old age would be a poor plea for the omi&s;&s;ion of filial duty; nor can the petulant frowardne&s;s or wanton folly of children by any means excu&s;e a parent's negligence or contempt of them: a &s;i&s;ter's ignorance, her weakne&s;s, even her crime mu&s;t not utterly blot out a brother's tenderne&s;s; nor a bro|ther's
<PB N="12" REF="19">
cruelty de&s;troy a &s;i&s;ter's affection: where ties are clo&s;e and intere&s;ts united, we mu&s;t not &s;uffer every trifle to un|loo&s;e them: where there is, or where there ought to be, much love, there mu&s;t be much forgivene&s;s al&s;o; <HI>a man's wor&s;t foes,</HI> where they are foes, <HI>are tho&s;e of his own hou&s;hold</HI>; when that home, which &s;hould be our &s;helter from the injuries of a malicious world, and all tho&s;e cruel &s;lights we receive abroad, becomes it&s;elf loath&s;ome and dete&s;table, when the reed we had &s;o long leant on, breaks and pierces our &s;ides, the pain mu&s;t needs be exqui&s;ite. In &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, it is not the &s;toic's apathy, nor all the heathen's boa&s;ted &s;uperiority over pain and di&s;quietude, which can &s;upport us; as men we mu&s;t feel them, but as chri&s;tians we mu&s;t bear them with patience and re&s;ignation, and happy is it for us that chri&s;tianity, which teaches us to bear, can teach us al&s;o to prevent the&s;e evils; it will teach
<PB N="13" REF="20">
us, if we attend to its dictates, a kind and friendly behaviour, which alone can keep alive and maintain that mutual tenderne&s;s and affection, which con&s;ti|tute our dome&s;tic felicity.</P>
<P>TO a mind that has the lea&s;t tincture of humanity, the lea&s;t feeling for the &s;ufferings of our fellow-creatures, there cannot be a &s;pectacle more &s;hocking and di&s;agreeable, than to &s;ee tho&s;e, who&s;e blood, fame, fortunes, and intere&s;ts are united, and who&s;e good offices &s;hould be mutual, torn to pieces by jealou&s;ies, hatred and divi&s;ion; to &s;ee them hara&s;|&s;ing and oppre&s;&s;ing, who &s;hould be em|ployed in &s;erving and obliging each other; &s;uch &s;cenes make us a&s;hamed of our nature, and out of love with our very being; they give us the idea of a rude and uninformed world, the anti|ent chaos of matter, where all the ele|ments were met together, and nothing reigned but di&s;cord, darkne&s;s, and con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="21">ON the other hand, a well-regulated and happy family, where order and harmony are pre&s;erved, where peace, tenderne&s;s, love and affection reign, un|tainted with di&s;cord, unembittered by &s;trife or animo&s;ities, where there is a con&s;tant, unwearied endeavour to &s;erve and oblige each other; &s;uch a family is doubtle&s;s a &s;ight well-plea&s;ing in the eyes of that God, who formed the members of it: it is an emblem (though an imperfect one) of the whole frame of nature, the glorious fabric of the univer&s;e, built by the divine architect, who&s;e wi&s;dom ordained its &s;ymmetry and proportions, where each part is perfect in it&s;elf, and contributes at the &s;ame time to the beauty, magnificence, and duration of the whole.</P>
<P>LET us then endeavour to cultivate in our minds a &s;ettled good will, an ha|bitual benevolence, without which we
<PB N="15" REF="22">
&s;hall always fall &s;hort of our duty, both towards God, and towards our neigh|bour: and here let me ob&s;erve to you, that love to man, no more than love to God, can ever con&s;i&s;t in the ob&s;ervance of mere external forms; a compliance with po&s;itive in&s;titutions, and decent ceremonies, &s;hew a re&s;pect and defe|rence highly commendable in the one; the practice of politene&s;s and good breed|ing &s;ignify a readine&s;s to &s;erve and oblige in the other: but the profe&s;&s;ions of the tongue are as a <HI>tinkling cymbal,</HI> unle&s;s they flow from the dictates of an hone&s;t and an upright heart; we mu&s;t exert our benevolence, we mu&s;t ma|nife&s;t the love of our neighbour, by the &s;ame means as the &s;upreme Being makes known his love to us, by conti|nued acts of kindne&s;s and beneficence.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t learn therefore (if we ex|pect to live peaceably) to bear with the infirmities, to pardon the errors, to give
<PB N="16" REF="23">
way to the di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e with whom it is our lot to be any ways con|nected. As depraved as human nature is, there are few tempers &s;o hard, but a perpetual endeavour to plea&s;e, will &s;often into love and gratitude; we mu&s;t not always expect to meet with all we could wi&s;h for in our companions, be|cau&s;e the &s;weete&s;t minds may be &s;our|ed by accident or misfortune, the chear|fulle&s;t face &s;addened by pain or &s;ickne&s;s; and if we re&s;olve to be in good humour our&s;elves, no longer than whil&s;t all round about us continue &s;o, our &s;ocial happine&s;s will very &s;eldom, I fear, be of any long duration.</P>
<P>LET us remember then, that as af|flictions do not, &s;o neither do plea&s;ures, &s;pring out of the du&s;t: every relative and &s;ocial duty is founded on mutual obligations; where the &s;eeds of love and friend&s;hip are not &s;own, or where what &s;prings up from them is not cultivated
<PB N="17" REF="24">
and improved, it will be but <HI>as the gra&s;s growing on the hou&s;e-top, wherewith,</HI> as the glorious language of the p&s;almi&s;t expre&s;&s;eth it, <HI>the mower filleth not his hand, neither he that bindeth the &s;heaves his bo&s;om.</HI></P>
<P>A KIND and tender behaviour, there|fore, to tho&s;e with whom we live, in whatever &s;ituation of life we are, is what I would recommend and enforce as a branch, and no incon&s;iderable one, of Chri&s;tian duty; a duty indeed, which (like the re&s;t of tho&s;e injoined us in the holy go&s;pel) doth mo&s;t amply reward it&s;elf. Our Saviour came down from heaven to <HI>bring peace upon earth</HI> and <HI>good-will towards men</HI>; that peace and good-will which makes the happine&s;s of the whole and of every individual. The re&s;ult of all then that hath been here advanced is this, that, if we hope to be happy in our &s;everal &s;tations and profe&s;&s;ions, in all the various circum|&s;tances
<PB N="18" REF="25">
of this life, we mu&s;t be humane, charitable, and benevolent; whatever makes us lovely will make us beloved, and whatever tends to the peace and felicity of our fellow-creatures mu&s;t render us amiable in the &s;ight of our Creator: it is this alone which can make the humble&s;t lot an object of envy and admiration, the <HI>dinner of herbs</HI> a fea&s;t for an epicure.</P>
<P>TO CONCLUDE&mdash;</P>
<P>The vi&s;ible connection between our duty and our happine&s;s is too apparent to be further in&s;i&s;ted on; in all our private concerns, all tho&s;e relations and connections which we bear to one ano|ther, that love and affection, which I have now endeavoured to recommend, is the fountain and foundation of all our &s;ocial plea&s;ures; and as our dome&s;tic bli&s;s is a point in which we are every one of us deeply and intimately con|cerned, our time, I think, cannot be
<PB N="19" REF="26">
better employed than in the due re|flection on tho&s;e means, which may mo&s;t effectually promote it: I mu&s;t beg you therefore to con&s;ider what hath now been offered as preparatory to &s;ome &s;e|lect di&s;cour&s;es, wherein I propo&s;e to ex|plain and illu&s;trate the relative duties; that is to &s;ay, the duties of child and parent, &s;ervant and ma&s;ter, wife and hu&s;band: on the due performance of the&s;e mutual and indi&s;pen&s;ible obliga|tions the happine&s;s of man doth, I ap|prehend, in a great mea&s;ure depend; and according to the manner in which we di&s;charge the&s;e important offices, we &s;hall be rewarded or puni&s;hed both here and hereafter.</P>

<P>ALL tho&s;e philo&s;ophers who have mo&s;t curiou&s;ly explored the goodne&s;s of the Almighty in the animal creation, have concurred in ob&s;erving that the
<PB N="26" REF="31">
in&s;tinctive tenderne&s;s of creatures towards their young is a worthy example for the be&s;t of parents, and a &s;evere, though &s;ilent, reproach of the bad among&s;t us; but &s;trong as this natural affection is in every cla&s;s of irrational beings, it re|mains no longer than whil&s;t it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the propagation and &s;upport of the &s;pecies: the connection on each &s;ide is &s;oon lo&s;t, another love &s;ucceeds, another race ri&s;es up to enjoy it; but man is graciou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed by his Maker, in this, as in every other particular, and maintains his &s;overeign|ty over the creation: he is endued with faculties to be &s;en&s;ible of, and with power to repay the benefit; the care and tenderne&s;s of the parent, the love and gratitude of the child, are con&s;tant and permanent, and the mutual ex|change of affection carried on from the earlie&s;t dawn of life even to the late&s;t period of it.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="32">IN man, indeed, as in every other creature, the love implanted in the brea&s;t of the parent towards the off|&s;pring is much more inten&s;e than that implanted in the child towards its pa|rent. And herein the providence of God is immediately vi&s;ible, and the rea&s;on &s;ufficiently obvious; the child, we know, is helple&s;s and de&s;titute, and without that care and tenderne&s;s mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h; whereas the parent may &s;ub&s;i&s;t (though not with an equal &s;hare of comfort and &s;atisfaction) with|out the return of filial duty.</P>
<P>BUT this, as well as every other, rea|&s;on, would be a poor plea for the omi&s;&s;ion, or rather perhaps to every grateful and ingenuous mind, would be a &s;tronger in|ducement to the performance of it.</P>
<P>But that no plea or excu&s;e whatever can indeed be admitted will be &s;uffi|ciently evident, when we come to con|&s;ider
<PB N="28" REF="33">
in the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;cour&s;e, the various parts of this duty, together with our nece&s;&s;ary and indi&s;pen&s;able obligations to the practice of it.</P>
<P><HI>Honour thy father and mother,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>that it may be well with thee, and thou maye&s;t live long on the earth.</HI></P>
<P>BY <HI>honour,</HI> in the more &s;trict and confined &s;en&s;e of the word, is under|&s;tood no more than that deference and re&s;pect wich is due from inferior to &s;uperior, varying according to the various ties and relations, the &s;everal circum|&s;tances and conditions of human life; exclu&s;ive of parental authority, it is the accu&s;tomed tribute of youth to age and experience, in grateful return for the benefits of its advice, and the influence of its example; and this doubtle&s;s is a part, and no incon&s;iderable one, of the duty here injoined.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="34">THE highe&s;t deference, re&s;pect, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;hould be &s;hewn to parents, becau&s;e they are, next to God, the mo&s;t proper objects of them. <HI>Cur&s;ed be he,</HI> &s;ays the law of Mo&s;es, <HI>that &s;etteth light by his father or mother</HI>: where no re&s;pect is paid to the per&s;on we can hardly expect obedience to his commands, and we have &s;eldom any great love or e&s;teem for tho&s;e whom we treat with levity and contempt.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider that the pains and afflictions which attend the latter part of our lives are &s;o many and &s;o great, the advantages and privileges of age &s;o few and incon&s;iderable, we cannot with|out the utmo&s;t inhumanity abridge it of the lea&s;t of them: And yet this branch of filial duty is very often &s;haken off, and very frequently neglected, and par|ticularly by tho&s;e who are a little ad|vanced in life, who as &s;oon as they be|gin to receive re&s;pect and deference them|&s;elves,
<PB N="30" REF="35">
forget to pay it where it is due, and even whil&s;t they enjoy the good effects of parental in&s;truction, are regard|le&s;s of tho&s;e to whom they are origi|nally indebted for it.</P>
<P>THE greater the obligations are which we have at any time laid on others, the better treatment do we of cour&s;e expect in return, and with the greater degree of warmth do we re&s;ent any injury or contempt from them; the &s;lighte&s;t wound gives the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pain, when inflicted by the hand we love. What then mu&s;t the parent feel, who, in&s;tead of reciprocal tenderne&s;s and affection, in&s;tead of that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive deference, which he has a right to ex|pect, meets with &s;urline&s;s and pride, with a contemptuous di&s;regard of him, from a thankle&s;s child? Even expre&s;|&s;ions of civility, even that complai&s;ance and good-breeding, which to others may appear amiable, in his eyes will &s;eem
<PB N="31" REF="36">
cold and di&s;re&s;pectful. How can we per&s;uade our&s;elves to fill that heart with angui&s;h and di&s;quietude, which is &s;o &s;olicitous for our welfare; or give a moment's unea&s;ine&s;s to tho&s;e who &s;pend their lives in providing for our wants, defending us from danger, and promot|ing our joy and happine&s;s!</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides this deference and re&s;pect, the&s;e outward marks of e&s;teem, there is &s;omething more required: the &s;in|cere&s;t te&s;timony of filial affection, (and which mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be included in the precept of my text) is obedience. To <HI>honour our parents</HI> is to obey them, to &s;ubmit implicitly to their orders, and dutifully to perform whatever is enjoin|ed by them.</P>
<P>AND here (as in almo&s;t every duty) our Saviour him&s;elf hath conde&s;cended to be a guide and example to us. The &s;ons of men need not err, for the &s;on
<PB N="32" REF="37">
of God hath pointed out to them the mea&s;ure of their obedience: he &s;ubmitted to the commands of his Almighty Fa|ther, and obeyed them chearfully, with|out reproach, murmur, or reluctance; he endured the mo&s;t painful &s;ufferings, with patience and content; even in the hour of death, he petitions with humililty, but &s;ubmits with re&s;ignation; <HI>Father, if it plea&s;e thee, remove this cup from me; neverthele&s;s, not my will but thine be done.</HI></P>
<P>WHERE there is ab&s;olute and total dependance on one &s;ide, there &s;hould be total and ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the other; here then a title to obedience is already e&s;tabli&s;hed, and it is as vain as it is ungrateful to di&s;pute it: re&s;i&s;tance can be of no effect, there is therefore in the rebellion of children, as much fol|ly, as wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT moreover that which is the in|di&s;pen&s;able duty of children, is their
<PB N="33" REF="38">
real and true&s;t intere&s;t al&s;o; it is the peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing advantage of parental power, that the intere&s;t of him who lays the command, and of him who performs it, is for the mo&s;t part plainly, and indi&s;putably, the &s;ame. The ma|gi&s;trate may, and perhaps frequently doth, compel his inferior to actions highly di&s;gu&s;tful, and &s;ometimes ex|tremely pernicious to him, becau&s;e he has a &s;ecret view to his own advance|ment; the general may force his &s;oldiers to ru&s;h on danger and death to promote his glory; and the de&s;potic tyrant may &s;acrifice millions of his &s;ubjects to his own pride and ambition: But the father has no private intere&s;t to promote in op|po&s;ition to his children, no ambition but to make them amiable, no views but to make them happy; here then there can be no doubt or jealou&s;y, the relation they &s;tand in, exempts them from the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of fraud or treachery; and, in a world where there is &s;carce any
<PB N="34" REF="39">
thing el&s;e, how ine&s;timable is &s;uch &s;incerity!</P>
<P>So agreeable to the law of nature and rea&s;on is this important duty, as to be held even by the un-enlightened heathens in the highe&s;t e&s;teem and ve|neration:
<Q>he that is undutiful to his parents, (&s;ays the Athenian law,) &s;hall be incapable of holding any office;</Q>
among&s;t the Romans al&s;o, if a father came to want, and the &s;on, if able, did not relieve him, he was &s;entenced by the laws again&s;t ingratitude, to be the father's &s;lave for life; the wi&s;e, and pious rulers in tho&s;e times, were doubtle&s;s of opinion, that no obligations could influence, no ties could bind the man who had broken through the bonds of nature; that the love of his country could never re&s;ide in <HI>that</HI> brea&s;t which was void of filial affection; that where the father's authority was &s;lighted, the magi&s;trate's would be but ill &s;ubmitted to; and that <HI>he</HI> in &s;hort
<PB N="35" REF="40">
mu&s;t be very unfit to <HI>rule,</HI> who had ne|ver learn'd to <HI>obey.</HI></P>
<P>But further, &mdash;</P>
<P>BY <HI>honouring</HI> our parents, is undoubt|edly meant the giving them all the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, &s;upport, and defence, which they may at any time &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>SUCH are the vici&s;&s;itudes of human life, that it is no &s;trange or uncommon cir|cum&s;tance, to &s;ee penury or di&s;tre&s;s u&s;urp the &s;eats of joy and plenty; to &s;ee tho&s;e who had flouri&s;hed in the earlier part of life in affluence and pro&s;perity, reduced at the clo&s;e of it to want and mi&s;ery, oblig'd to &s;truggle with the world at an age when they are mo&s;t unfit to en|counter it, and in&s;tead of re&s;ting in peace after a trouble&s;ome journey, compelled to bear the heat and burthen of the day. Here then filial duty hath the noble&s;t opportunity of exerting its gratitude: all that a child can do, is no more than
<PB N="36" REF="41">
what he is &s;trictly bound to do, and no danger is &s;o great, but in &s;uch a ca&s;e he &s;hould readily go through it; no toil &s;o &s;evere, but he &s;hould mo&s;t willingly bear it.</P>
<P>A numerous family has often &s;unk tho&s;e, who, without it, might have lived in the utmo&s;t &s;plendor; to the weight of its branches the tree may owe its de|cay: here the obligation receives new force; to relieve the wants we our&s;elves have cau&s;ed, is but common ju&s;tice; to heal the wounds which our own hands have made, is but common humanity.</P>
<P>AGE, we know, has always a melan|choly attendance. Infirmities vex, di&s;ea|&s;es torment, and death affrights it; health &s;carce enlivens, &s;ickne&s;s totally depre&s;&s;es it; it calls for the compa&s;&s;ion therefore and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all; from man to man, it implores them as favors; from the parent to his children it demands them as a debt; the greate&s;t indeed which
<PB N="37" REF="42">
we can contract, and the fir&s;t which we are bound to di&s;charge: <HI>My &s;on,</HI> &s;ays the wi&s;e man, <HI>help thy father in his age, and grieve him not as long as he liveth, and if his under&s;tanding fail, have patience with him, and de&s;pi&s;e him not when thou art in thy full &s;trength; for the relieving of thy father &s;hall not be forgotten, it &s;hall be added to build thee up, in the day of af|fliction it &s;hall be remembered.</HI> But&mdash;</P>
<P>ANOTHER method of <HI>honouring</HI> our parents is, to have &s;uch a regard to our own character and reputation in the world, as never, if po&s;&s;ible, to be guilty of any action which may reflect &s;hame or di&s;grace upon them.</P>
<P>THE con&s;equences of vice are &s;eldom indeed confined to the per&s;on of the offender, they reach much further, and affect others as well as our&s;elves. The malice and ill-nature of mankind is always ready enough to attribute the
<PB N="38" REF="43">
follies of children to the negligence, or example of their parents. What &s;hall we &s;ay then to tho&s;e, who in&s;tead of impart|ing joy and &s;atisfaction to the virtuous parent, repay their cares and tenderne&s;s with ignominy and di&s;grace; who, in&s;tead of adding dignity to their age, and weight to their authority, by a licentious and abandon'd life, load their hearts with &s;orrow, increa&s;e the burthen of their years, and <HI>bring their grey hairs in &s;orrow to the grave?</HI></P>
<P>TO <HI>honour</HI> our parents then is, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> to &s;hew re&s;pect and deference to them in all our words and actions: <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> readily and implicitly to hearken to their precepts, and obey their commands: and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> to &s;upport, defend, and relieve them: to &s;upport tho&s;e who have defended us, to relieve tho&s;e who have relieved us. <HI>Honour thy father with thy whole heart,</HI> &s;ays the &s;on of <HI>Sirach, and forget not the &s;orrows of thy mother; remember
<PB N="39" REF="44">
that thou wa&s;t begot of them, and how can&s;t thou recompence them the things which they have done for thee?</HI></P>
<P>THE obligation indeed is not ea&s;ily recompenced, becau&s;e it is not ea&s;ily known; true genero&s;ity always enhances the value of the gift by concealment: innumerable in&s;tances of paternal ten|derne&s;s pa&s;s over, and are forgotten, and thou&s;ands are never &s;een.</P>
<P><HI>The father,</HI> &s;ays the wi&s;e man, <HI>waketh for the daughter when no man knoweth, and the care for her taketh away &s;leep</HI>; to be &s;upported when we are unable to &s;upport our&s;elves, to be defended from the world at a time when we have not power to contend with it, to receive not only pre&s;ent maintenance, but to have our future joy and happine&s;s provided for, are &s;urely benefits which call for the highe&s;t and &s;incere&s;t acknowledgments: but the true value of this ble&s;&s;ing like
<PB N="40" REF="45">
mo&s;t others is perhaps &s;carce ever percei|ved till it is lo&s;t; whil&s;t we revel at the fea&s;t we forget the ma&s;ter of it, and &s;eldom know the true merit of paternal affection, till we feel the want of it.</P>
<P>LOOK round upon the ignorant and illi|terate, the poor and de&s;titute, the vicious and abandoned part of mankind, enquire into the cau&s;es of this depravity, the &s;ource of their indigence, the rea&s;ons of their ignorance, and you will mo&s;t ge|nerally find that the&s;e unhappy wretches are orphans; &s;uch as had no parents to in&s;truct or provide for them, a wandering flock who had no guide to direct them, <HI>no &s;hepherd to feed them in green pa&s;tures,</HI> or <HI>lead them be&s;ide the waters of comfort.</HI></P>
<P>LET the reflection on their unhappy circum&s;tances &s;ink deep into the &s;ouls of tho&s;e who have e&s;caped them; let us view the &s;torm at a di&s;tance, and ble&s;s the pilot who &s;aved us from it, let tho&s;e
<PB N="41" REF="46">
have enjoyed, who have been ble&s;t with the life of their parents, be truly thank|ful for the benefit, and by repaying, &s;hew that they de&s;erve it. But there is al&s;o another inducement to the practice of this virtue, which may po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ome influence upon us, and that is, the hope of our&s;elves receiving the benefit of it. We mu&s;t pay that duty as children, which as parents, we may hereafter ex|pect to be paid to us.</P>
<P><HI>By the &s;ame that a man &s;inneth,</HI> &s;ays the &s;cripture, <HI>by the &s;ame al&s;o &s;hall he be pu|ni&s;hed:</HI> the undutiful child will mo&s;t probably be an unhappy father, the poi|&s;oned cup &s;hall return to his own lips, he &s;hall meet with that di&s;obedience from his children which he had him&s;elf been guilty of, and &s;hall want that duty and re&s;pect which he refu&s;ed to pay.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t incitement to the practice of this duty which I &s;hall now mention
<PB N="42" REF="47">
is, that mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive one &s;ubjoined in the text: <HI>Honour thy father and mo|ther, that it may be well with thee, and thou maye&s;t live long on the earth.</HI></P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable, that the command to <HI>honour</HI> our parents is, as St. Paul re|marked, <HI>the fir&s;t commandment with pro|mi&s;e:</HI> Thus doth religion, which in the language of holy writ, is always &s;tiled <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> provide for tho&s;e who <HI>walk in her ways; length of days is in her right hand, and in her left riches and honours. Honour thy father, and thy mo|ther, that thou maye&s;t live long on the earth:</HI> that is, if by an obedient and dutiful behaviour to thy parents, thou do&s;t prolong their life, and contribute to their health and happine&s;s, thou &s;halt thy&s;elf be rewarded with the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ings. God we &s;ee, doth &s;o peculi|arly delight in the execution of this duty, that he hath promi&s;ed even to &s;u&s;|pend, for a time, the laws of nature in
<PB N="33" REF="48">
favour of tho&s;e who comply with it; as if the Divine Being were him&s;elf unwil|ling to interrupt us in the performance of an office &s;o grateful to him.</P>
<P>IF, then, we expect to live a long and happy life, let us be careful, as many of us as are able, to de&s;erve it. Not all, indeed, have it in their power. Death &s;ometimes cancels the debt, before tho&s;e who have contracted can po&s;&s;ibly di&s;|charge it; in the fir&s;t dawn of life, in that part of our exi&s;tence when we fir&s;t receive the benefit we are not &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of it; and when we become &s;o, it frequently happens, that it is too late to &s;hew our acknowledgments of it. As &s;oon as men, therefore, arrive at an age, when they can thoroughly feel the good effects of their parents care; and can reflect, as they ought, on all their pa&s;t acts of goodne&s;s and tenderne&s;s towards them, then, and then alone, they have it in their power to make &s;ome return for it. It is their duty, then, to lay
<PB N="44" REF="49">
hold on the glorious opportunity. Few parents live long enough to receive from their children that rational and &s;incere obedience which they have merited from them. They &s;ow early, and reap late; and therefore, doubtle&s;s, more abundant &s;hould be the harve&s;t.</P>
<P>TO conclude, therefore, with a &s;hort character of</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A GOOD SON.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>good</HI> and dutiful <HI>Son,</HI> then, is one who <HI>honoureth</HI> his parents, by paying them the utmo&s;t deference and re&s;pect; by a reverential awe and veneration for them; a filial affection for their per&s;ons, and a tender regard for their &s;afety and pre&s;erva|tion; a con&s;tant and chearful attendance to their advice, and a ready and implicit obedience to their commands. As he be|cometh every day more &s;en&s;ible of his obligations to them, he grows every day more willing and more &s;olicitous to re|pay

them. He employs his youth to &s;upport their age; his abundance to re|lieve their wants; his knowledge and &s;trength, to &s;upply their infirmities and decay. He is more careful of his cha|racter and reputation in the world, be|cau&s;e theirs depends upon it. Ever anxious for their welfare, and attentive to their happine&s;s, he endeavours, by every method in his power, to prolong <HI>their</HI> days, that his <HI>own</HI> may be <HI>long in the land.</HI> He re&s;ts a&s;&s;ured, that God will not only ble&s;s obedient children here, but will reward them with the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, where it &s;hall be <HI>well with him</HI> for ever; where we &s;hall all join, &s;on and father, daughter and mother, wife and hu&s;band, &s;ervant and ma&s;ter; all the relations and connections of this life, to honor one great Parent, Protector, Lord, and Ma&s;ter of us all:</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS all relations are founded on mu|tual and reciprocal dependencies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. III.</NOTE> and we can have no right to de|mand where we have never be&s;towed any thing, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, that the love, re&s;pect, and obedience, which are required of children, are founded on tho&s;e benefits which they have from time to time received at the hands of their parents, who are thus re|warded
<PB N="50" REF="53">
for their care and tenderne&s;s. As children, therefore, are bound to &s;erve and reverence their parents, pa|rents are al&s;o on their part, equally obliged to &s;upport and provide for their children; not <HI>to provoke them to wrath</HI> and di&s;obedience, and then reproach them for it, but the more effectually to &s;ecure to them&s;elves honor and re&s;pect; to educate them in &s;uch a manner, as to make them acquainted with every part of filial duty; to <HI>bring them up</HI> &s;oberly, virtuou&s;ly, and religiou&s;ly; or as the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH the affection of the parent towards the child is, as I ob&s;erved to you in my la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, much &s;tronger and more inten&s;e, than that of the child towards the parent, and con&s;equently the breach of duty on one part, by no means &s;o frequent as on the other; &s;uch, notwith&s;tanding, is the weakne&s;s and
<PB N="51" REF="54">
depravity of human nature, that chil|dren may, as St. Paul hath remarked, be <HI>provoked,</HI> and ju&s;tly <HI>provoked to wrath,</HI> by the faults and follies of their parents, as will more evidently appear, when we come to con&s;ider the many errors, weak|ne&s;&s;es, and imperfections which we are all liable to, and to point out the principal &s;ources of mutual contempt, hatred, and animo&s;ity which make &s;o many families unhappy.</P>
<P>CHILDREN may be <HI>provoked to wrath</HI> by the churli&s;hne&s;s and inhumanity of their parents; by their weakne&s;s and indulgence; by their partiality; their inju&s;tice, or their impiety. Permit me to make a few &s;hort reflections on every one of them.</P>
<P>AND fir&s;t then, Children may be <HI>pro|voked to wrath,</HI> by the churli&s;hne&s;s and inhumanity of their parents.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="55">IT is not in the lea&s;t to be wondered at, that men of moro&s;e and cruel di&s;po|&s;itions &s;hould <HI>provoke their children to wrath,</HI> by har&s;h and &s;evere treatment of them: their own home, is perhaps, the only place where they can command without oppo&s;ition, and tyrannize with impunity; as cowardice and cruelty are in&s;eparable, they will mo&s;t probably exert their authority where it cannot be di&s;|puted, and in&s;ult where they cannot be re&s;i&s;ted. Parents are every day found among&s;t us, who &s;hew their power only by the abu&s;e of it; who treat their chil|dren as &s;laves; who, yielding to every impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion and re&s;entment, al|ways rebuke with a&s;perity, and cha&s;ti&s;e with rigor: but &s;urely &s;uch &s;avages are a di&s;grace to human nature: Youth hath a thou&s;and pleas to urge in its favour which the deafe&s;t ear mu&s;t li&s;ten to: ignorance hath always a claim to pity; and innocence a title to protection. There are very few faults indeed in
<PB N="53" REF="56">
children which are not pardonable; and half their errors &s;hould only be attri|buted to inexperience and inadvertency. Let the &s;evere parent reflect, that if he <HI>provokes his children to wrath,</HI> he will be him&s;elf, in all probability, the greate&s;t &s;ufferer by it; that di&s;tance and re&s;erv|edne&s;s mu&s;t naturally produce a &s;ervile dread and diffidence; whil&s;t on the con|trary, an open and ingenuous confidence on one &s;ide, would as naturally beget e&s;teem and regard on the other; let him reflect, that though he may be obeyed, he cannot be loved; that the blow will be felt, though it is not re|turned; and, that tho&s;e, who cannot re|taliate, will, notwith&s;tanding, re&s;ent the injury. Above all, let the &s;evere pa|rent remember, that <HI>he al&s;o hath a Fa|ther in heaven,</HI> to whom he looks up for love, tenderne&s;s, and affection, for pardon, indulgence, and reward; if he &s;hould exerci&s;e his parental authority in like manner, and rule over his chil|dren
<PB N="54" REF="57">
with <HI>a rod of iron,</HI> if he &s;hould be <HI>extreme to mark what is done ami&s;s, who might abide it?</HI></P>
<P>BUT, &s;econdly, children may be <HI>pro|voked to wrath</HI> by the contrary extreme of weakne&s;s and indulgence.</P>
<P>A MORE dangerous, and certainly a much more frequent error in parents, is an unre&s;trained and exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s; and this, however ill calculated it may &s;eem for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, may, in the end, as ju&s;tly and as inevitably <HI>provoke children to wrath</HI> as the oppo&s;ite extreme of churli&s;hne&s;s and &s;everity; the various pa&s;&s;ions and affections of human nature begin very early to exert and di&s;play them&s;elves, and if they are not properly re&s;trained and directed, will of nece&s;&s;ity have a fatal and unconquerable influ|ence over the whole tenor of our lives; if we give up the reins to appetite, at an age, when rea&s;on is too weak to guide
<PB N="55" REF="58">
them, and &s;uffer the will to rule with de&s;potic &s;way, uncontroul'd by judg|ment, and unaw'd by parental autho|rity, every vice will gain daily &s;trength by habit, and every propen&s;ity to evil take &s;uch deep root in the &s;oul, as never to be extirpated; if the child is never corrected, it is mo&s;t probable that the man will never be virtuous; and if the child is always complied with, the man will be always unhappy. How often indeed do children live to condemn that fondne&s;s, which was the &s;ource of their guilt; and to cur&s;e that indulgence which was the foundation of their mi|&s;ery!</P>
<P>BUT there is another method of <HI>pro|voking children to wrath</HI>; where the re|&s;entment on one &s;ide is highly warrant|able, and the injury on the other to the la&s;t degree inexcu&s;able; and that is, the partial affection of a parent for one child, in preference to others, equally de&s;erv|ing
<PB N="56" REF="59">
of it; this is acting in direct oppo|&s;ition, both to the will and to the con|duct of our Almighty Father, who, in his di&s;pen&s;ations towards man, teacheth us another and a better le&s;&s;on: the chil|dren of nature all divide his tenderne&s;s, all &s;hare his equal love, without par|tiality, prejudice, or di&s;tinction: we &s;hould follow his &s;teps, and imitate his ju&s;tice. Nothing but a &s;uperior &s;hare of duty and obedience, can lay claim to &s;uperior favour and indulgence: no ex|ternal beauty of form, however &s;triking; no natural accompli&s;hments, however excellent; no pre-eminence of genius, talents and abilities, however brilliant and engaging; &s;hould have &s;uch weight in the &s;cale of parental love, as to de|&s;troy that equal ballance which &s;hould be ever held with a &s;teady and un&s;haken hand. When this is once lo&s;t, the foundations of dome&s;tic happine&s;s are undermined; &s;trife, divi&s;ion and ani|mo&s;ity u&s;urp the &s;eats of harmony and
<PB N="57" REF="60">
peace; and where jealou&s;y and hatred are thus early &s;own, they generally &s;hoot up into a rank and fruitful harve&s;t of guilt and mi&s;ery. When children find it impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e, they will natu|rally lo&s;e all de&s;ire of plea&s;ing; where they are neglected, they will neglect; and where they are injured, they will re&s;ent. The&s;e, and a thou&s;and other ill con&s;equences, which it is unnece&s;&s;ary to enumerate, will inevitably flow from the partial di&s;tribution of parental ten|derne&s;s: and yet there is &s;carce a large and numerous family to be met with, where this evil is not in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;een, felt, and lamented.</P>
<P>THERE are, we mu&s;t acknowledge, &s;trange weakne&s;&s;es, prejudices and pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in human nature, not ea&s;ily to be accounted for, which act, no doubt, as forcibly on parents as on other men; but when we are attacked by them, we mu&s;t call in rea&s;on and religion to our
<PB N="58" REF="61">
aid, to combat the&s;e prejudices, to counteract and &s;ubdue the&s;e weakne&s;&s;es and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: above all, we mu&s;t remember to place our&s;elves in the &s;itu|ation of tho&s;e who are to &s;uffer by them; to ob&s;erve the golden rule, the great criterion of ju&s;tice, and <HI>do as we would be done unto.</HI></P>
<P>But &mdash;</P>
<P>There is another method, and which is too often practi&s;ed by angry and in|exorable parents, of <HI>provoking children to wrath,</HI> by unju&s;tly defrauding them of their patrimony, without ju&s;t cau&s;e. <HI>If any provide not for his own,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>and e&s;pecially for tho&s;e of his own hou&s;e, he hath denied the faith, and is wor&s;e than an infidel:</HI> he mu&s;t, indeed, be &s;trictly and literally wor&s;e, more de&s;|titute of feeling and humanity, than the mo&s;t &s;avage and illiterate barbarians, among&s;t whom, &s;trangers as they are to God and religion, the crime of de&s;erting
<PB N="59" REF="62">
and defrauding their off&s;pring, is yet unknown. Children have a clear and indi&s;putable right, from the great char|ter of nature, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of their parents; and unle&s;s that right is for|feited by &s;ome flagrant enormity, it can|not, with any degree of equity, be wre&s;t|ed from them: the laws of men, in this ca&s;e, coincide and co-operate with the laws of God; and the claim of inheri|tance, in all civilized nations, is univer|&s;ally allowed and con&s;ented to, unle&s;s the contrary is peculiarly &s;pecified: tho&s;e offences, therefore, &s;hould be of a very heinous nature, and accompanied with mo&s;t aggravating circum&s;tances, which can excu&s;e a parent in bereaving his children of their patrimony: no venial inadvertency ari&s;ing from inexpe|rience, no imprudent &s;allies of unguarded youth, no unpremeditated acts of ca&s;ual di&s;obedience can palliate &s;uch inju&s;tice: for the mo&s;t part, indeed, &s;carce any other cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;ign'd for the commi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="60" REF="63">
of this crime, but whim, caprice, or re|&s;entment: &s;ome there are who &s;creen their guilt beneath the veil of piety, and cloath their vice in the habit of a virtue: but this is a poor and wretched &s;ubterfuge; the mean eva&s;ion of cruelty and pride. The man, who deprives his children of their inheritance, and beg|gars his po&s;terity, to &s;ooth his vanity by ill-placed beneficence, though he may be canonized as a &s;aint upon earth, will never be enrolled among the ble&s;&s;ed in heaven. It is, upon the whole, an act of inju&s;tice which, however the offender may reconcile to him&s;elf by &s;pecious ar|guments, however by delu&s;ive rea&s;ons he may per&s;uade the world to pa&s;s over or approve, his con&s;cience will mo&s;t probably reproach him for in this world, and his Creator puni&s;h in that which is to come.</P>
<P>THERE is, moreover, another branch of parental duty, the omi&s;&s;ion of which
<PB N="61" REF="64">
mu&s;t <HI>provoke children to wrath</HI>; and that is, not only to bequeath to them their due patrimony, not only to provide for their future ea&s;e and happine&s;s, but to promote by every method in their power, their pre&s;ent and immediate welfare: to admini&s;ter to their nece&s;&s;ities, and relieve their di&s;tre&s;s, to double every comfort, and le&s;&s;en every calamity. The inheri|tance, which we leave our children, is no more than a debt which we owe to nature, and which ju&s;tice demands of us: there is very little merit in parting with that which we can no longer re|tain: po&s;thumous charity and genero&s;i|ty, therefore of this, as of every other kind, is of &s;mall value or e&s;teem. It often happens, that parents bequeath large e&s;tates, after their deaths, to chil|dren, whom they had kept in the utmo&s;t penury all their lives, and with-hold every thing from their family, till the hand of God wre&s;ts it from them: and what is generally the con&s;equence of this? the
<PB N="62" REF="65">
children are <HI>provoked,</HI> and ju&s;tly <HI>provoked, to wrath:</HI> the omi&s;&s;ion of duty on one part produces a neglect of it on the other; the bonds of mutual affection are gradually loo&s;ened and unwoven: to the warmth of love and tenderne&s;s, &s;ucceed coldne&s;s and indifference; tho&s;e, who &s;tand in need of &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and at the &s;ame time think they have a right to it, will be greatly hurt and di&s;appointed, when it is unkindly with-held from them: in&s;tead of pray|ing for the continuance of their parents life, they are tempted, but too often, to look forwards with &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, towards the di&s;&s;olution of it: and where indeed, there is penury, di&s;tre&s;s and re|&s;entment on one &s;ide, with affluence, avarice and inhumanity on the other, all the aid, which filial affection, mora|lity and religion can afford, will &s;ome|times prove ineffectual. If parents, there|fore, hope for love, tenderne&s;s, and obe|dience from their children, they mu&s;t,
<PB N="63" REF="66">
as long as they live, in proportion to their circum&s;tances and abilities, a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;upport, and relieve them: we mu&s;t love, in &s;hort, if we expect to be loved; we mu&s;t give plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction, if we expect to receive them; we mu&s;t look up, in this, as in every other point of duty to the great &s;tandard of perfec|tion, the tender, affectionate, univer&s;al Parent, the Creator and Father of man|kind; <HI>He</HI> deals forth his bounties to all his children, with a liberal and impar|tial hand; directs them by his council, guards them by his providence, and &s;up|ports them by his power; guides, in|&s;tructs, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts them here, and en|courages them in the practice of duty and obedience, by the unalienable re|ver&s;ion of a noble inheritance hereafter.</P>
<P>But la&s;tly: &mdash;</P>
<P>Parents may <HI>provoke their children to wrath,</HI> by their own wicked and licen|centious lives: not only by a neglect
<PB N="64" REF="67">
and di&s;regard of <HI>them,</HI> but by the little attention which they pay to <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> and to their own character and reputa|tion in the world. As parents frequent|ly &s;uffer for the follies of their children, &s;o may children al&s;o &s;uffer for the follies of their parents: it becometh all men to act with prudence and di&s;cretion; to behave &s;oberly and religiou&s;ly, and to ab&s;tain from every evil word and work; but, it is peculiarly incumbent on every father and mother, to keep a <HI>con&s;cience void of offence</HI>; to put a bridle on their lips, and place a guard over their hearts: the &s;olemn relation which they have en|tered into, the important office which they are bound to perform, demand a more than ordinary care of their conduct in every particular. The minds of chil|dren are &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of every impre&s;|&s;ion; &s;o intirely guided by the direction, and influenced by the example of tho&s;e who are immediately connected with them, that no caution can be too great,
<PB N="65" REF="68">
no re&s;traint too rigid and &s;evere, with re|gard to every thing done and &s;aid within their pre&s;ence, or within the &s;phere of their knowledge and comprehen&s;ion. There is a reverence due to youth, as well as age: not an action &s;hould be commit|ted before children, which hath the lea&s;t tendency towards &s;in; not a word &s;hould e&s;cape our lips, that might taint the purity of un&s;ullied innocence. How much, then, has the guilty parent to an&s;wer for, who, in&s;tead of &s;etting a fair example to his children, and di|recting them in the paths of truth and happine&s;s, mi&s;leads their unwary foot|&s;teps into the paths of &s;in and &s;orrow; who debauches tho&s;e morals, which he ought to improve, and &s;ubjects tho&s;e to the divine wrath, whom it is his in|di&s;pen&s;able duty to &s;helter from it!</P>
<P>THOUGH many other cau&s;es, ari&s;ing from particular incidents in life, or from
<PB N="66" REF="69">
the different tempers and di&s;po&s;itions of men, may occa&s;ionally con&s;pire to di&s;turb the peace of families, by <HI>provoking chil|dren to wrath,</HI> tho&s;e which I have already mentioned, will generally be found the mo&s;t prevalent: the be&s;t method, to guard again&s;t &s;uch weakne&s;&s;es, and to prevent the ill con&s;equences of them is, probably, that rule of conduct, which the apo&s;tle hath pre&s;cribed in the latter part of my text, admoni&s;hing parents, to <HI>bring up their children in the nurture of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>ST. <HI>Paul,</HI> who well knew how much depends on a virtuous and religious edu|cation, recommends it as the great and leading duty, including, as it were, and comprehending every other: he indeed, who regularly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly per|forms this, will not often be found de|ficient in any of the re&s;t: it is &s;carce probable, that hew ho knows and teaches the principles of chri&s;tianity, &s;hould him|&s;elf
<PB N="67" REF="70">
act &s;o directly in oppo&s;ition to them, as to <HI>provoke his children to wrath,</HI> by any of tho&s;e errors which I have above enumerated. It is not in the power of every man to provide for his children, with regard to the good things of this life, in the manner he could wi&s;h, or they, perhaps de&s;erve; his own circum|&s;tances may be too narrow to make theirs ea&s;y; his own intere&s;t, merit, or abilities too &s;mall and incon&s;iderable, to recommend them to powerful favour and protection; but, it is in every man's power to <HI>bring up his children in the fear of the Lord,</HI> to form their minds to the practice of virtue, and in&s;til into them, as early as po&s;&s;ible, the principles of re|ligion and morality.</P>
<P>THIS is a duty which, I fear, is too often neglected among&s;t us. The know|ledge of languages, of arts and &s;ciences, is univer&s;ally taught and inculcated
<PB N="68" REF="71">
with the utmo&s;t pains and a&s;&s;iduity; whil&s;t the noble&s;t &s;cience of all, that of Morality, the be&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful know|ledge, the knowledge of our&s;elves, is &s;eldom enquired into. Care is taken to fill the garden with every flower that can beautify or adorn, but &s;carce one u&s;eful fruit, or &s;alutary herb, is planted in it: Children, in &s;hort, are taught every language, but the language of the heart; in&s;tructed in every religion, but the religion of Chri&s;t; and acquainted with every book, but the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>PIETY &s;trengthens the bonds of filial, as well as of every other duty: tho&s;e children, therefore, will always be the mo&s;t obedient, tender and affectionate, who act from con&s;cientious and religi|ous principles. Tho&s;e, who have been <HI>brought up in the nurture and the admoni|tion of the Lord,</HI> will mo&s;t probably re|pay their parents care and attention, by
<PB N="69" REF="72">
love and gratitude towards them: it is therefore the father's highe&s;t intere&s;t, as well as his indi&s;pen&s;able duty, to in|&s;truct his children in religion; to ac|quaint them with the ways of God, to explain the doctrine of Chri&s;t, and the terms of &s;alvation: as all the pains he takes in this ta&s;k, will be amply recom|pen&s;ed; and the gift, which he be&s;tows, be <HI>returned fourfold into his own bo&s;om.</HI></P>
<P>TO CONCLUDE, therefore, with the character of</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A GOOD FATHER.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>good Father</HI> is ever humane, ten|der and affectionate to his children; he treats them, therefore, with lenity, and kindne&s;s,; corrects with prudence, re|bukes with temper, and cha&s;ti&s;es with reluctance: he never &s;uffers his indul|gence to degenerate into weakne&s;s, or
<PB N="70" REF="73">
his affection to be bia&s;&s;ed by par|tiality: as he rejoices in their joy, and participates in their afflictions, he never &s;uffers them to want a ble&s;&s;ing which he can be&s;tow, or to lament an evil which he can prevent: whil&s;t he con|tinueth with them, he admini&s;ters to their pre&s;ent happine&s;s, and provides for their future felicity when he &s;hall be removed from them; he is doubly cau|tious in pre&s;erving his own character, becau&s;e theirs depends upon it; he is prudent, therefore, that they may be happy, indu&s;trious that they may be rich, good and virtuous, that they may be re&s;pected: he in&s;tructs by his life, and teaches by his example: as he is thoroughly &s;atisfied, that piety is the &s;ource and foundation of every virtue, he takes care to <HI>bring them up in the nur|ture and admonition of the Lord:</HI> that they may be good <HI>men,</HI> he endeavours to make them good <HI>chri&s;tians</HI>; and after having
<PB N="71" REF="74">
done every thing in his power to make them ea&s;y and happy here, points out to them the only infallible means of &s;ecuring eternal bli&s;s and tranquility hereafter.</P>

<P>HAVING endeavoured in my two la&s;t di&s;cour&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM.

When we con&s;ider the innu|merable evils ari&s;ing to &s;ociety, from the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and extravagance, or from the &s;loth and negligence of &s;er|vants, we cannot but acknowledge, that the due performance of their duty, in every particular, is a point of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence; that every method &s;hould therefore be made u&s;e of to enforce, and every argument to recommend the prac|tice of it; becau&s;e, in this large and com|plicated machine of the univer&s;e, if the &s;maller, or &s;ubordinate wheels, are out of order, it mu&s;t of cour&s;e, retard the motion, and interrupt the operations of the whole.</P>

But the &s;u|preme Being, hath in his divine wi&s;dom, thought fit to make us, as the holy &s;crip|ture expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>members one of another</HI>; without &s;ubordination, without order, rank and degree among men, the world would be a &s;cene of anarchy and con|fu&s;ion: be&s;ides that, the various &s;ta|tions and circum&s;tances of human life calls forth the various powers and facul|culties of men, and give them opportu|nities of exerci&s;ing their &s;everal quali|ties and perfections. God, therefore, hath &s;o ordained it, that &s;ome &s;hall live upon the fruits of the earth, which the labour of others produceth, that in the great chain of nature, one link &s;hall

Nor doth this difference and di&s;tinction, in the lea&s;t, impeach the rectitude of the divine conduct; neither have we the lea&s;t right, or rea&s;on, to complain of partiality or inju&s;tice. It would be very ea&s;y to &s;hew, that, as the highe&s;t and mo&s;t exalted &s;tations are attended with numberle&s;s pains and inconveni|encies; the lowe&s;t al&s;o is not with|out its &s;hare of comfort and &s;atisfac|tion: it would be no difficult ta&s;k to convince the complaining &s;ervant, that the advantages of maintenance, &s;upport, and protection, from an indulgent ma|&s;ter, the ea&s;e and tranquillity which it is always in his own power to procure, and many other advantages &s;ufficiently obvious, are frequently an overballance

for the &s;plendor of riches, and the daz|zling lu&s;tre of independency. &mdash; But &s;ince to complain in this ca&s;e, is as ab|&s;urb as it is unju&s;tifiable, becau&s;e it can|not po&s;&s;ibly relieve the &s;ufferer; &s;ince it is the appointment of God, and there|fore the duty of all, in patience and re|&s;ignation, to &s;ubmit to it, &mdash; Our time will be be&s;t employed in con&s;idering, if our lot has ca&s;t us into the humble vale of life, how we may be&s;t behave our|&s;elves in it, perform the ta&s;k which God hath impo&s;ed upon us, and in|&s;ure to our&s;elves, that reward of inhe|ritance, which he hath promi&s;ed to tho&s;e, who truly and faithfully di&s;charge it.</P>

<P><PB N="80" REF="81">Now, by the <HI>Obedience</HI> here ex|pre&s;&s;ed, how unlimited &s;oever it may appear, we are not to under&s;tand, that a &s;ervant is obliged always to conform to the will and direction of his ma&s;ter, however unju&s;t or unrea&s;onable: for, if what he commands, (as may, and per|haps, doth frequently happen) be in di|rect oppo&s;ition to the laws of God, or of man, the partial obligation by which he is connected, doth by no means hind him to the performance of it: the la&s;t contract we make, will not annul that which was prior to it: the relations which we bear to each other, were or|dained to &s;trengthen, and not to, di&s;&s;olve, the more powerful ties of ju&s;tice and morality: he, therefore, who, the better to perform the fir&s;t, breaks through and infringes the latter, is altogether as wi&s;e as he, who &s;hould endeavour to &s;trengthen the building, by undermin|ing the foundation.

make the complaint, to reflect, that this boa&s;ted privilege, which they are &s;o loth to be deprived of, is often attended with the mo&s;t fatal and de&s;tructive con|&s;equences; that tho&s;e who &s;ay and do all that they will, very &s;eldom either &s;ay or do as they ought, that to be left to our&s;elves, without con&s;traint or con|troul, is &s;o far from being a ble&s;&s;ing, that it would be rather one of the great|e&s;t misfortunes which we can po&s;&s;ibly fall into; and that as proud and as wil|ling as we all are to command, it is always more ea&s;y and more &s;afe, very often even more plea&s;ant to obey.</P>
<P>BUT it is not, as the apo&s;tle informs us, a mere external obedience which will acquit us: <HI>Serve your ma&s;ters,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>not with eye-&s;ervice, as men-plea&s;ers.</HI> It is not &s;ufficient, that whil&s;t &s;ervants are under the immediate in&s;pection of their ma&s;ters, they &s;hould behave with &s;ome degree of diligence and a&s;&s;iduity,
<PB N="83" REF="84">
but that they &s;hould &s;erve and oblige them with equal diligence when ab&s;ent: no eye but the eye of God can &s;ee every thing at all times, and in all places; it is impo&s;&s;ible that any man, how careful and indu&s;trious &s;oever he may be, can provide for every contin|gency, or &s;ee every thing executed which is nece&s;&s;ary; he mu&s;t depend in &s;ome mea&s;ure, therefore, on the integrity of tho&s;e beneath him. Here then will commence the true te&s;t of obedience, and the marks of unfeigned attachment and &s;incerity.</P>
<P>MUTUAL tru&s;t and confidence are the great bonds of &s;ociety, without which it cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t: when we have bound our&s;elves, therefore, by &s;o|lemn contract; when we have agreed, in return for the manife&s;t benefits and advantages of daily &s;upport and protec|tion, to promote the intere&s;t and wel|fare of tho&s;e who thus &s;upport and pro|tect us, the obligation is, doubtle&s;s, of
<PB N="84" REF="85">
double force, and the neglect of it in|finitely more unpardonable, becau&s;e it adds fraud and treachery to rapine and inju&s;tice. He who deprives a &s;tranger of his right, is a thief; but he who de|frauds his ma&s;ter, is a traitor al&s;o; and though the lenity of human laws may inflict an equal puni&s;hment on both, they will certainly meet with very different treatment from the divine. Hone&s;ty and integrity are the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential perfections of a good &s;ervant; as on the&s;e the &s;ecurity of every man's right and property, mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, depend. Servants &s;hould be extreme|ly careful, not to &s;ecrete or embez|zle the lea&s;t part of that which is entru&s;ted to them; becau&s;e, when they have once brought them&s;elves, by &s;pe|cious arguments, to believe that to de|fraud, or injure another, may be <HI>&s;ome|times</HI> lawful, they will &s;oon be per&s;uaded that it is <HI>always</HI> &s;o; and who will &s;erve or defend tho&s;e, who have betrayed that con|fidence
<PB N="85" REF="86">
which was repo&s;ed in them; who have ruined and de&s;troyed, tho&s;e whom they had &s;worn to guard and protect?</P>
<P>BUT it is further incumbent on every good &s;ervant, not only to be ju&s;t, hone&s;t, and upright him&s;elf, but to take care, as far as in him lies, that others are ju&s;t al&s;o: not to &s;uffer his ma&s;ter, at any time, to be injured or defrauded. Men, frequently cheat them&s;elves into an opi|nion, that they are not an&s;werable for the wickedne&s;s which they connive at; and, that they can only &s;uffer for what they commit; but, it is a mi&s;erable and fatal &s;elf-delu&s;ion; a delu&s;ion, which will ruin their fame, character, and in|tere&s;t here; and withal, greatly endan|ger the &s;afety of their &s;ouls hereafter. For in the ca&s;e now before us, as well as innumerable other in&s;tances which might be mentioned, that &s;ervant, who &s;ees his ma&s;ter robbed, or betrayed; who hears him calumniated, and abu&s;ed, and is &s;o
<PB N="86" REF="87">
mean, &s;o timid and ungrateful, as to pa&s;s it over unnoticed, and unre&s;ented, but ill de&s;erves that protection and reward which he receives from him. There is not the lea&s;t doubt to be made, but that, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, to be &s;ilent is to be guilty, and he who conceals the crime, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure acce&s;&s;ary to it.</P>
<P>BUT another branch of the &s;ervant's obedience, and without which he cannot indeed, properly, de&s;erve the name of one, is diligence; and the want of this is mo&s;t inexcu&s;able; becau&s;e it is a per|fection which it is in the power of all to attain; and it requires nothing but a willing mind to the performance of it; it is of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to parts and genius where they <HI>are,</HI> and in a great mea&s;ure &s;upplies their place where they are <HI>not:</HI> it is, after all, but a &s;pecies of the duty I ju&s;t now men|tioned, of uprightne&s;s and integrity; for he who is not indu&s;trious, is not hone&s;t;
<PB N="87" REF="88">
and to be diligent, is only to be ju&s;t&punc; the ma&s;ter has as good a right to the labour, time, and a&s;&s;iduity of the &s;er|vant, as the &s;ervant can po&s;&s;ibly have to the &s;upport, protection and wages of his ma&s;ter: If the latter, therefore, per|forms his part of the contract, the for|mer cannot, without the utmo&s;t inju&s;|tice, with-hold the other: he &s;hould place him&s;elf in the circum&s;tances and &s;ituation, then, of his ma&s;ter; he &s;hould give the &s;ame indu&s;try, and a&s;&s;iduity to his affairs, as if they were his own: his own, in reality, they mo&s;t certainly are; becau&s;e, on the &s;ucce&s;s and fortune of the one, the ea&s;e and maintenance of the other mu&s;t depend: and yet, what dreadful con&s;equences have ari&s;en to the be&s;t of men, from the ill conduct and behaviour of tho&s;e whom they had hired to ruin and betray them! Such incon|&s;i&s;tent judges are we of what is truly valuable in this life, that where we pro|mi&s;e our&s;elves the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, we
<PB N="88" REF="89">
often meet with the bittere&s;t di&s;appoint|ment; and what flattered us with the faire&s;t pro&s;pect, brings with it the greate&s;t trouble and anxiety. To make a &s;plen|did appearance, to boa&s;t a numerous retinue, to have a croud of va&s;&s;als atten|dant on our plea&s;ure, and &s;ub&s;ervient to our commands, may &s;ooth the pride and vanity of our hearts; but doth it not often happen, that the&s;e are trea&s;ures which we pay very dearly for? that our &s;ervants ruin and betray us? that their negligence de&s;troys, their di&s;hone&s;ty un|dermines, their extravagance ruins their ma&s;ters? and thus the very thing which cau&s;ed the envy, is that which mo&s;t de|&s;erves the pity of our inferiors.</P>
<P>But the apo&s;tle, in the latter part of my text, has recommended a virtue, which would prevent all the&s;e evils, and promote every good; he has recom|mended a perfection which will &s;trength|en and cement all the re&s;t; and that is,
<PB N="89" REF="90">
<HI>&s;inglene&s;s of heart,</HI> a pious con&s;cientious regard to the engagement we have en|tered into: <HI>Whatever ye do,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.</HI> What&s;oever we do heartily, we &s;hall always do effectually. Servants, therefore &s;hould endeavour to inculcate in them&s;elves, a de&s;ire of plea&s;ing and obliging; they &s;hould create, as it were, a tenderne&s;s and affection for tho&s;e whom they &s;erve.</P>
<P>LOVE is, indeed, the life and &s;oul of every relative duty; the powerful enli|vening principle, which alone can in|&s;pire us with vigour and activity in the execution of it: without this, even di|ligence is ungrateful, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion it&s;elf has the air of di&s;obedience; a cold, languid, &s;piritle&s;s compliance with the will of another &s;eems forced and extorted, and when tho&s;e whom we expect to follow us through life mu&s;t, be dragged after us, it retards our pro|gre&s;s,
<PB N="90" REF="91">
and at the &s;ame time takes off half the plea&s;ure of the journey. But, on the other hand, when reciprocal tru&s;t and confidence, have produced mutual love and affection, every thing flows on in an ea&s;y, uninterrupted cour&s;e of joy and &s;atisfaction; plea&s;ure and duty go hand in hand, <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace ki&s;s each other:</HI> every wi&s;h on each &s;ide is prevented, and every jealou&s;y removed; the ma&s;ter's will is known before it is expre&s;&s;ed, and the &s;ervice performed even before it is commanded.</P>
<P>THUS good, thus profitable, and thus happy, are they who act from <HI>&s;inglene&s;s of heart, fearing God.</HI> The <HI>fear of God,</HI> in this, as in every thing el&s;e, <HI>is the be|ginning of wi&s;dom.</HI> Tho&s;e &s;ervants, in|deed, who wrong or betray, who in|jure or neglect their ma&s;ters, have rea|&s;on to fear that God whom they have offended; becau&s;e, when we are de|ficient in any of tho&s;e duties which we

owe to our neighbour, we tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of the mo&s;t High: in all our rela|tions and connections with each other, God is the witne&s;s to every contract, and mu&s;t know whether we perform it or not: he is the great guardian of the rights and privileges of all mankind; he &s;its on the &s;eat to <HI>do judgment and ju&s;tice;</HI> and when any are oppre&s;&s;ed or injured here, to him they mu&s;t appeal for re|dre&s;s; if the &s;ervant, therefore, wrong his ma&s;ter; if he is di&s;hone&s;t, &s;lothful, idle and extravagant, God will avenge the cau&s;e of the injured, and ca&s;t <HI>the un|profitable &s;ervant into utter darkne&s;s, where &s;hall be weeping and wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth.</HI> Whil&s;t, on the other hand, if the &s;ervant obey his ma&s;ter in all things with <HI>&s;inglene&s;s of heart, fearing God</HI>; if he is hone&s;t, faithful, diligent and grateful, he &s;hall, as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>receive the inheritance.</HI> It is the hap|pine&s;s of &s;ervants, and ought with gra|titude to be remembered by them, that

<P>THE gracious providence of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. V.</NOTE> exerted con&s;tantly and invariably towards mankind, is not in any thing more immediately vi&s;ible, than in that very part of the divine conduct to which the fooli&s;h unbeliever hath the &s;tronge&s;t objection. The unequal di&s;tri|bution of things in this &s;hort and tran|&s;itory life, the great power, riches and abundance, happine&s;s, knowledge and
<PB N="100" REF="100">
capacity of &s;ome, the no le&s;s di&s;tin|gui&s;hed weakne&s;s, indigence, poverty and ignorance of others, were &s;o ordained, no doubt, by the creator of all, to &s;et in motion the various qualities and perfec|tions of our nature; to teach us, that we were born to &s;erve and love one ano|ther; to employ our health, &s;trength and plenty, for the &s;upport and comfort of the weak, the &s;ick, and the nece&s;&s;itous. To &s;ome, therefore, he hath appointed their &s;tation in the humble vale of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and dependency, put upon them the yoke of &s;ervitude, and &s;ubjected them to the will of their &s;uperiors: others, at the &s;ame time, he hath thought fit to exalt to rank, fortune and precedency; to give them rule over their brethren; to en|dow them with power and abundance: but, in return for this power and autho|rity, for the good things of life, which he hath thus graciou&s;ly be&s;towed on the great, our Ma&s;ter, which is in heaven, expects that we, on our part, &s;hould take
<PB N="101" REF="101">
care of our &s;ervants upon earth; that we &s;hould give them all things that are <HI>ju&s;t and equal.</HI></P>
<P>BY <HI>ju&s;t and equal,</HI> we are, doubtle&s;s, to under&s;tand all the various parts of a ma&s;ter's duty to his &s;ervant which cir|cum&s;tance, merit, or occa&s;ion may at any time require of him: in the&s;e words, therefore, are comprehended and im|plied, not only ju&s;tice in the &s;trict and limited &s;en&s;e, but maintenance and pro|tection, indulgence and tenderne&s;s, ad|vice and in&s;truction, pardon and for|givene&s;s.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more &s;elf-evident, than that tho&s;e who contribute, in a great mea&s;ure, to our ea&s;e and happine&s;s, have an indi&s;putable title to a reward from us. Among&s;t wild and barbarous nations, where power is gained and &s;up|ported by mere force and brutality, men
<PB N="102" REF="102">
may exerci&s;e a &s;avage authority over their &s;laves and va&s;&s;als, without con|&s;idering them&s;elves bound to any grate|ful return for their toils and &s;ervice; but in the more refined parts of the world, at all times, and in all nations, the obligations of ma&s;ter and &s;ervant, have been con&s;idered as mutual; it is a clo&s;e and intimate relation, a &s;olemn engagement entered into by them both, and which both are equally bound to di&s;|charge. The fir&s;t great duty, therefore, incumbent on ma&s;ters is, &s;trictly and punctually to abide by their contract, and to reward the &s;ervant for his labour, according to the agreements made be|tween them: and yet, even this com|mon act of ju&s;tice and humanity is not always performed; though it cannot be with-held from them without the mo&s;t flagrant and glaring impiety. Thus far we are bound by the common ties of equity, which bind man to man, and
<PB N="103" REF="103">
without which, &s;ociety indeed, cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT by giving unto our &s;ervants, what is <HI>ju&s;t and equal,</HI> the apo&s;tle, undoubtedly, implied &s;omething more than the &s;trict performance of this mutual contract. To ju&s;tice, we mu&s;t add benevolence al&s;o. Tho&s;e who enter into a &s;tate of &s;er|vitude, are generally poor and de&s;titute; they have no friends able to &s;upport or protect them, and, therefore, have re|cour&s;e to a ma&s;ter: to him they fly, as to an a&s;ylum, from the injuries and op|pre&s;&s;ions of a cruel world: they are dri|ven, as it were, into this harbour, by the &s;torms and tempe&s;ts of human life, which beat hard upon them, and force them in for immediate &s;helter and pre|&s;ervation: we cannot, therefore, in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances, refu&s;e our a&s;&s;i&s;|tance to them; if they are faithful and diligent in the di&s;charge of their office,
<PB N="104" REF="104">
we are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, indebted to them for their care and fidelity.</P>
<P>IN all civilized countries, as well as in our own, the &s;ervants of the public are taken care of by the public: tho&s;e who have &s;pent their lives in the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, and been u&s;eful to the com|monweal in their youth, are main|tained and &s;upported by it in their age. The &s;ame rea&s;on &s;hould, doubtle&s;s, hold good with regard to the private &s;ervice of individuals; and we are bound to pre|&s;erve and &s;upport tho&s;e who have long faithfully di&s;charged their duty to us. The fidelity, carefulne&s;s and &s;obri|ety of a good &s;ervant, hath often re|&s;tored tho&s;e fortunes which have been well nigh di&s;&s;ipated by much nearer re|lations; and where one hath performed that duty, which the other hath totally neglected, he is mo&s;t certainly inti|tled to the greater reward.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="105">BUT, moreover, it often happens, that tho&s;e are reduced to a &s;tate of penury and &s;ervitude, who have lived in ea&s;e and affluence, and that &s;uch as have been long u&s;ed to command, are forced to obey: the&s;e, no doubt, both call for and de&s;erve a more than ordinary ten|derne&s;s, and peculiar delicacy of beha|viour towards them; we &s;hould lay the burthen of labour in &s;uch a manner, as to make them lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible of it, and, if we cannot rai&s;e them to what they were, we &s;hould degrade our&s;elves, as it were, to what they have been: we all of us experience, &s;ome time or others how irk&s;ome and di&s;agreeable it is to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the will of others: when even the rich and great, therefore, are forced to pay homage to their &s;uperiors, the unea&s;ine&s;s which they feel on the occa&s;ion &s;hould be an u&s;eful le&s;&s;on of in&s;truction, and teach them to behave with humanity and good nature towards
<PB N="106" REF="106">
tho&s;e beneath them. There is always a lively &s;en&s;ibility which attends the in|digent and mi&s;erable, and more e&s;peci|ally tho&s;e who have &s;een better days, which awakens them to the quicke&s;t re|&s;entment; they are often jealous of an injury where it is not meant, and &s;hrink under the wound even before it is gi|ven. When haughty and imperious ma&s;|ters, therefore, behave with in&s;olence, and &s;peak with contempt of their &s;er|vants, it is both unju&s;t and inhuman, becau&s;e it is imputing that to them as a crime, which &s;hould be pitied as a mis|fortune; and to reproach them for be|ing unhappy, is, in effect, to make them &s;o. The unmanly and ungenerous treat|ment of our inferiors is, doubtle&s;s, the mark of a mind, as weak, as it mu&s;t be wicked; for, to in&s;ult tho&s;e who cannot return the in&s;ult, is cowardice; and it is the heighth of folly to triumph, where there is no glory in the conque&s;t.</P>

<P>THOSE who in their earlier years have been oppre&s;&s;ed by want and pe|nury, are &s;eldom ble&s;t with the advan|tages of a good and liberal education; their ideas are confined in a very narrow circle, their minds often bia&s;&s;ed towards evil, by habit and cu&s;tom, and kept in total ignorance and darkne&s;s, from the want of opportunities, to improve: a ma&s;ter, therefore, if he hath lei&s;ure and capacity, &s;hould endeavour to open and enlighten them, he &s;hould teach them their duty, both towards God and towards man; in&s;truct them in that reli|gion, which he him&s;elf profe&s;&s;eth; and explain tho&s;e doctrines by which he re|gulates his own conduct and behaviour. And that he may the better perform this important ta&s;k, his advice mu&s;t be &s;trengthened by his life, and his precepts

enforced by his example. It becometh all men no doubt, and above all men it be|cometh chri&s;tians, to be cautious and prudent in their behaviour; to attend the hou&s;e of God, and perform every act of piety and devotion, with that de|cency and &s;olemnity which they require; but, to the ma&s;ter of a family, the&s;e obligations are, every one of them, more cogent and more binding. When a man hath once taken upon him this im|portant office (for &s;o it is) the circle of his duties is then enlarged, and extends it&s;elf on every &s;ide: it is then incumbent on him, to let no bad examples, much le&s;s his own, influence the lives and manners of tho&s;e he is placed over: he is the chief actuating &s;pring which is to direct the whole machine: he is the head, and when that is out of order, the members will no longer perform their office, and all the frame is in immediate danger of di&s;&s;olution: he is to be a pat|tern to them in every word and work:
<PB N="112" REF="112">
he, therefore, &s;hould be careful, that not a word pa&s;s his lips, which is im|mode&s;t or profane, idle or ridiculous; that not an action be attributed to him that is evil, lea&s;t they call in his wicked|ne&s;s to countenance their folly, his au|thority and example to give a &s;anction to their guilt.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;ervants &s;ee their ma&s;ters liv|ing in a continued &s;cene of riot, madne&s;s and debauchery, in open contempt and defiance of God's laws, is it probable, that they them&s;elves, &s;hould any longer pay the lea&s;t regard to them? will they give ear to tho&s;e doctrines which their ma&s;ters contemn, that religion which they de&s;pi&s;e, or that redeemer which they ridicule and &s;coff at?</P>
<P>NOTHING, I believe, hath &s;o much tended to the corruption and depravity of the age we live in, as the bad exam|ples of the rich and great among&s;t us:
<PB N="113" REF="113">
vice had, perhaps, as many followers in the days of our forefathers as in our own, but then it mu&s;t be acknowledg|ed, they did not enter &s;o publicly and openly into her &s;ervice: the rich and powerful, were at all times, and in all ages, licentious and extravagant; but they, had the mode&s;ty, at lea&s;t, to avoid the appearance of it.</P>
<P>WHAT the effects of a conduct di|rectly oppo&s;ite to this, mu&s;t inevitably be, we need not foretel; but certain it is, that the bad example of the great, hath &s;o far influenced their inferiors, that the follies, which once confined them&s;elves to courts and palaces, are to be found even in, the cottages of the poor, and the majority of &s;ervants are almo&s;t as vicious as their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who thus de&s;pi&s;e the apo&s;|tle's advice in the former part of my text, remember what he makes men|tion
<PB N="114" REF="114">
of in the latter; let them reflect and know, that <HI>they al&s;o have a ma&s;ter in heaven:</HI> they who acknowledge none upon earth, will find one there; <HI>know|ing,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>that ye al&s;o have a ma&s;ter in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>EQUALITY of circum&s;tance and con|dition, doth naturally, and of nece&s;&s;ity, produce &s;ome degree of love and atten|tion: the &s;ick have companion for the &s;ick, the old have tenderne&s;s for the old, the poor man is melted by the tears of indigence; and he, who hath any di&s;tre&s;s or calamity of his own, has generally a heart to feel for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and calamities of others. The &s;ure&s;t method, therefore, of becoming good, humane and tender ma&s;ters to our &s;er|vants is, to reflect that we al&s;o, <HI>are &s;er|vants</HI> our&s;elves; that we have all our allotted portions of toil and labour, our various &s;ervices which we are bound to perform; that our behaviour to tho&s;e
<PB N="115" REF="115">
beneath us, is among&s;t tho&s;e &s;ervices; and that it is, indeed, no incon&s;iderable part of our duty towards our great Lord and Ma&s;ter: <HI>with the &s;ame mea&s;ure that we mete withal, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to us again.</HI> If we are kind and indulgent to our &s;ervants, God will be &s;o to us; if we pa&s;s over their failings, excu&s;e their ignorance, palliate their weakne&s;s, and pardon their inadvertencies, he al&s;o, <HI>will not be extreme to mark</HI> when we <HI>do ami&s;s</HI>; he will con&s;ider our infirmi|ties, forgive our follies, pity, a&s;&s;i&s;t and remove our ignorance. But, on the other hand, we are to remember, that if <HI>we have a ma&s;ter in heaven,</HI> he is a ma&s;ter to puni&s;h, as well as to reward: that he is not like earthly ma&s;ters, to be im|po&s;ed upon or deluded; that he will have the &s;ervice of the whole heart; no partial, imperfect, in&s;incere obedi|ence, but an ab&s;olute, ready, vigilant compliance with all his commands, which are not, cannot be like our own,

them, and whom, therefore, he hath a right to treat as he thinks mo&s;t proper and convenient, but as a creature of the &s;ame rank and dignity with him&s;elf, made after the &s;ame divine image; as one who, though not &s;o con&s;iderable, is yet perhaps an equally u&s;eful member of &s;ociety, to whom providence hath ap|pointed an humbler, &s;tation in this life; one, whom he hath entered into &s;olemn contract and agreement with, for the reci|procal pre&s;ervation of their mutual peace and happine&s;s: as &s;uch, therefore, he pays with the utmo&s;t &s;trictne&s;s and punc|tuality, whatever is due to him for his labour and &s;ervitude.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING endeavoured to enforce and recommend the &s;everal infe|rior duties of child and father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VI.</NOTE> &s;ervant and ma&s;ter, I come now to con|&s;ider the great parent root from whence the&s;e branches originally proceed, the fountain and foundation of them, that clo&s;e and intimate connection which gives ri&s;e to all the re&s;t, the duties of hu&s;band and wife, tho&s;e &s;acred and indi&s;|&s;oluble
<PB N="124" REF="122">
ties, which con&s;titute the happi|ne&s;s or mi&s;ery of the greate&s;t part of the Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>IT may not be ami&s;s, before I pro|ceed to the con&s;ideration of this &s;ubject, to remark, that marriage is one of tho&s;e things, which, however lightly it may be e&s;teemed, of &s;poken of, by the gay and di&s;&s;olute; is, notwith&s;tanding, a mat|ter of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence and im|portance, as the welfare of &s;ociety in general, together with the ea&s;e and happine&s;s of individuals, doth in a great mea&s;ure depend upon it: I can|not, therefore, but be of opinion, that the unbounded freedom of &s;peech, the unwearied endeavours of licenc'd ridicule, with which it is &s;o familiarly and &s;o univer&s;ally treated, hath greatly contributed to the frequent contempt of this duty on each &s;ide, and the no le&s;s frequent violation of it of late years &s;o vi&s;ible among&s;t us. Let us endeavour,
<PB N="125" REF="123">
then to re&s;cue it from the hands of li|bertines, and the mouth of the &s;coffer. And to this end, I propo&s;e to point out to you, the &s;everal parts of this recipro|cal duty, and to recommend tho&s;e vir|tues which are more immediately nece&s;|&s;ary towards the performance of it.</P>
<P><HI>Let every one of you,</HI> &s;ays St. Paul, <HI>&s;o love his wife even as him&s;elf, and the wife &s;ee that &s;he reverence her hu&s;band.</HI></P>
<P>Under the two leading and e&s;&s;ential points, which are here mentioned by the holy apo&s;tle, we may fairly com|prehend all tho&s;e duties, that are re|qui&s;ite to make the marriage &s;tate ea&s;y and happy: love and affection will na|turally produce tenderne&s;s and fidelity; and reverence will as con&s;tantly and in|variably be attended with humility, pru|dence and devotion; and wherever the&s;e unite, they cannot fail to con&s;titute mutual and la&s;ting felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="124">AS in the preceding di&s;cour&s;es I have begun with the inferior duty, I &s;hall proceed in the &s;ame manner with regard to the &s;ubject under our pre&s;ent con&s;i|deration, and endeavour to point out to you, wherein the duty of a wife to her hu&s;band, doth principally con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>THE wife, then, &s;hould be faithful and con&s;tant, humble and obedient, pru|dent and di&s;creet, tender and kind, af|fectionate and pious.</P>
<P>THE &s;overeign virtue requi&s;ite in the married &s;tate, is FIDELITY, without which it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t: no perfections or qualities whatever, can make amends for the want of it; no excu&s;es whatever can be admitted to palliate the lea&s;t de|parture from it: both parties are bound in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to main|tain and pre&s;erve it inviolable, and the infringement of it will render them ob|noxious
<PB N="127" REF="125">
to the re&s;entment both of God and man: the nece&s;&s;ity is, in truth, &s;o &s;elf-evident, that I &s;hall dwell no fur|ther on it at pre&s;ent, than to ob&s;erve, that the neglect of it on the part of the wife is always attended with more fatal and de&s;tructive con&s;equences than on the part of the hu&s;band; becau&s;e, &s;he is the guardian of his honour as well as her own; becau&s;e, he &s;uffers for her guilt, and is puni&s;hed for her iniquity.</P>
<P><HI>A virtuous woman,</HI> &s;ays Solomon, <HI>is a crown to her hu&s;band, but &s;he that maketh a&s;hamed, is as rottenne&s;s in his bones.</HI> It is to be hoped, that in a Chri&s;tian country, there are not many in&s;tances to be found of conjugal fal&s;ehood and infi|delity. I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent, therefore, dwell on this point, but proceed to that mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential duty of a wife, OBEDIENCE.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="126">SOCIETY, we know, cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;ubordination: &s;tates and kingdoms can never flouri&s;h or increa&s;e, unle&s;s &s;ome pre&s;ide at the helm, to guide and direct, whil&s;t others follow and obey; without a head, the members cannot per|form their offices: without &s;ome ruling hand, inve&s;ted with power and authority to govern, puni&s;h or reward, there can be nothing but anarchy and confu&s;ion: and the &s;ame is equally nece&s;&s;ary, in all pri|vate connections: &s;uperior power mu&s;t be lodged in one hand, and the only doubt that can ari&s;e, if any doubt there be, is, to whom that power doth of right belong.</P>
<P>THE words of the apo&s;tle with regard to this, are very plain and explicit. <HI>The hu&s;band,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is the head of the wife. Man was not of the woman, but the woman of the man.</HI> Priority of birth, at their original formation, &s;eeming to im|ply
<PB N="129" REF="127">
and point out the precedency: but there is withal a rea&s;on which carries with it the highe&s;t conviction, and that is, the vi&s;ible &s;uperiority of one &s;ex over the other, &s;o manife&s;t in the abilities both of mind and body.</P>
<P>ARGREEABLE to the dictates of rea|&s;on in this re&s;pect, as indeed in all others, are the dictates of religion. Obedience of wives is the commandment of God him&s;elf; <HI>Thy de&s;ire &s;hall be to thy hu&s;band,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>he &s;hall ride over thee. Wives &s;ubmit your&s;elves,</HI> &s;ays St. Paul, <HI>to your hu&s;bands, as unto the Lord:</HI> that is, be a&s;&s;ured that duty towards your hu&s;|band is part of your duty towards God; that when you love the one, you plea&s;e the other; when you di&s;obey the one, you offend the other: you are bound to obedience not only by the promi&s;e made to your hu&s;band, but by a &s;till more &s;o|lemn engagement, by a promi&s;e made to the Almighty. God is not only a
<PB N="130" REF="128">
witne&s;s of the contract, but a part in it; he hath claim to a &s;hare in every con|nection, duty and relation, we enter into: the hu&s;band cannot relea&s;e the wife, nor the wife the hu&s;band; the &s;ervant his ma&s;ter, nor the ma&s;ter his &s;ervant; the father the &s;on, nor the &s;on his father from the punctual di&s;charge of them, without his divine con&s;ent and approbation: and though in regard to individuals, it may &s;o happen, that the direct contrary to what hath been advanced may be indi&s;putably true, no argument can thence be drawn again&s;t the general conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;on may, and frequently hath a larger portion of parts and under&s;tand|ing than his father, and &s;ervants better genius, &s;en&s;e and capacity than their ma&s;ters; and yet it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged, that this, in either ca&s;e would be a poor plea for their rebellion and di&s;o|bedience.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="129">HALF the mi&s;eries of mankind ari&s;e from pride and &s;elf-love; from that vain conceit we are &s;o apt to entertain of our|&s;elves, and of our own abilities.</P>
<P>The good and prudent wife, who is &s;atisfied of that natural &s;uperiority of man, which I have ju&s;t now menti|oned, will con&s;ider, that in ca&s;es of importance, the hu&s;band's knowledge and experience &s;hould make him a better judge than her; and therefore &s;he &s;hould &s;ubmit, and in matters of little or no con&s;equence it is &s;urely &s;carce worth while to di&s;pute about them. If di&s;putes however, do ari&s;e, mutual good nature and conde&s;cen&s;ion will prevent acri|mony, bitterne&s;s and anger. Let the end propo&s;ed therefore in all be truth and not victory, and the de&s;ire of both to convince, and not to conquer.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="130">To obedience therefore &s;hould al&s;o be added quietne&s;s and HUMILITY. The vir|tues of a woman were not meant to glare in the dazzling lu&s;tre of public bu&s;ine&s;s, but are ca&s;t as it were into the &s;hades of life, in the mild, maje&s;ty of private, &s;ocial, dome&s;tic happine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Let women adorn them&s;elves,</HI> &s;ays St. Paul, <HI>in mode&s;t apparel, with &s;hame-faced|ne&s;s and &s;obriety, not with broidered hair or gold, or pearls, or co&s;tly array; for I &s;uffer not a woman to teach nor to u&s;urp authority over the man, but to be in &s;ilence.</HI> Silence indeed is for the mo&s;t part apter to per|&s;uade than argument; when the &s;torm meets with re&s;i&s;tance, it is generally the mo&s;t violent; and the tender plant which bends beneath the bla&s;t, is much &s;afer than the lofty oak which &s;eems to defy it. After all, it is the wife's in|tere&s;t as well as duty, to be in &s;ubjecti|on to her hu&s;band; becau&s;e &s;he who
<PB N="133" REF="131">
mo&s;t ea&s;ily complies with his will, is, for the mo&s;t part indulged in her own; and &s;he hath the mo&s;t frequent opportunities to command, who is mo&s;t ready and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t willing to obey. A meek and quiet &s;pirit, we know, is with God of the high|e&s;t value. It may indeed happen, and frequently doth, that this meek and quiet &s;pirit &s;hall but provoke a moro&s;e and &s;urly temper to greater, in&s;ults; and that the coward who finds no re&s;i&s;tance, will repeat the blow. But to tho&s;e notwith&s;tanding who have humility, there is this con&s;olation &s;till behind, that however man may de&s;pi&s;e the jewel, God who knows its value will hold it of great price. A thou&s;and te&s;timonies of conjugal fidelity, love, tenderne&s;s, af|fection, and forgivene&s;s, may e&s;cape the eye of a vicious or of an indifferent hu&s;band, unknown and unregarded: but that eye which &s;eeth and knoweth all things will ob&s;erve them: and what is &s;till more to be wi&s;hed and de&s;ired,
<PB N="134" REF="132">
we may be certain, that wherever he &s;ees, virtue, he mu&s;t approve it; and wherever he approves, he is &s;ure to re|ward.</P>
<P>PROCEED we then to the next e&s;&s;en|tial quality of a good wife, DISCRE|TION. Conque&s;ts acquired by force, are maintained by policy; and the hearts which love hath &s;ubdued, mu&s;t be pre&s;erved by prudence: the do|minion of youth and beauty is arbitrary and de&s;potic, but like other tyrannies &s;eldom of any long duration. Prudence therefore, that faithful mini&s;ter, mu&s;t be called in to &s;ubdue the rebel pa&s;&s;ions, maintain a due ballance and proportion, and keep the &s;overeign on the throne. Whil&s;t tender years and inexperience palliate every error, and excu&s;e every inadvertency, prudence is not perhaps &s;o immediately nece&s;&s;ary; but when women have pa&s;t that favourable indul|gent &s;ea&s;on, and have entered into a &s;i|tuation

which calls for the exerci&s;e of this virtue every hour, it then becomes ab&s;olutely and really indi&s;pen&s;ible; and the want of it is as inexcu&s;able as it is fatal and de&s;tructive; and yet I know not how it is, but almo&s;t every other virtue is more frequently to be met with. At that time of life when we mo&s;t &s;tand in need of it, it is &s;eldom &s;een, and doth not make its appearance till it can be of little &s;ervice to us: To wives, we know, it often comes when its powers are languid and ineffectual, the affection of the hu&s;band is already e&s;tranged by infidelity, changed by in|difference, or decayed by ingratitude, di&s;|cretion &s;teps in at la&s;t to regain it; like an able phy&s;ician, it is not called till the la&s;t ga&s;p, when it is much too late to &s;ave the patient.</P>
<P>NOTHING is in reality &s;o un&s;uitable to the dignity, &s;o unbecoming the character of a good and virtuous wife, as
<PB N="136" REF="134">
that indi&s;creet carele&s;sne&s;s and levity of behaviour which has of late years crept in among&s;t us. The ta&s;te of plea&s;ure and diver&s;ions is grown &s;o univer&s;al, that fa|mily duties, and family decency and de|corum al&s;o are greatly neglected. The old and the young, the married and the &s;ingle, are &s;o blended together in the ge|neral ma&s;s of folly; the carriage, manners and behaviour of all are &s;o equally gay and di&s;&s;olute, that they &s;et the examples of vice, who&s;e duty it is to keep others from it; and &s;carce any thing is left to di&s;tingui&s;h the matron from her daugh|ter, but the wrinkles which &s;he cannot hide, and the years which &s;he cannot conceal.</P>
<P>When one &s;ex thus forget &s;tation, rank, and circum&s;tance, can we be &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find the other unwilling to re+member it? when women no longer behave them&s;elves as wives, do they de&s;ire, or can they expect to be treated
<PB N="137" REF="135">
as &s;uch? Whil&s;t there is a de&s;ire in every ge&s;ture, word and action to plea&s;e, all in|di&s;criminately, can we &s;uppo&s;e there is a &s;trong or powerful attachment to any individual? Let tho&s;e, therefore, who follow a giddy, thoughtle&s;s multi|tude, through the perpetual round of fa&s;hionable follies, remember, that a|mu&s;ement is no longer innocent when it interferes with duty; that example can only countenance that guilt which it doth not extenuate, and that public plea|&s;ure is dearly bought which is purcha&s;ed at the expence of private happine&s;s.</P>
<P>WOMEN, as well as men, are bound by the religion of Chri&s;t, not only to avoid vice, but the appearance of it: not only to be virtuous, but to &s;eem &s;o; be&s;ides that, their reputation is of &s;o tender a nature, that it is not always in the power even of innocence it&s;elf to pre&s;erve it. Tho&s;e who have only been
<PB N="138" REF="136">
carele&s;s, are generally cen&s;ured as guilty, and calumny will often puni&s;h for crimes which have never been committed. There is a great degree of imprudence, there|fore, in laying our&s;elves open to &s;u&s;pi|cion: &s;he, who is &s;o indifferent as to affect folly, is in great danger of fal|ling a &s;acrifice to it; and the wife who is very vicious in appearance, doth not de&s;erve much le&s;s blame than her who is &s;o in reality. The truly good and virtuous wife, will con&s;ider the honour of her hu&s;band as a precious jewel entru&s;ted to her care, which it is her duty to pre&s;erve free from every &s;pot, or blemi&s;h that might dimini&s;h its lu&s;tre or impair its beauty.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t pre&s;ervative of female ho|nour, therefore, is female delicacy: mo|de&s;ty is the hand-maid of virtue, ap|pointed to tend, to dre&s;s, and &s;erve her: it is, as it were, a kind of armour,
<PB N="139" REF="137">
which the &s;ex &s;hould always bear, both to adorn and to defend them; and, when that is laid a&s;ide, they are neither beau|tiful nor &s;afe.</P>
<P>THERE was a time when the re&s;erved|ne&s;s and mode&s;ty of women exempted them from many con&s;iderable privileges which they now enjoy; when that un|bounded freedom of conver&s;e, which the pre&s;ent age allows, was held incon&s;i&s;tent with female delicacy; when not the gay companion, nor the lively vi&s;itant, but the good and prudent wife, were e&s;teem|ed the be&s;t of characters: it would be|come tho&s;e, who have introduced and encouraged this change of manners, to con&s;ider, whether the plea&s;ures have not interfered with the bu&s;ine&s;s, and the du|ties of life been &s;acrificed to the imper|tinencies of it; whether the matrons of former ages were not, at lea&s;t, as mode&s;t, if not &s;o well bred, as tho&s;e who come
<PB N="140" REF="138">
after them; and whether, what the &s;ex nath gained in politene&s;s, it hath not lo&s;t in virtue? There is, (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) a &s;ex of &s;oul, as well as body, and the di&s;tinction is as vi&s;ible in the one, as in the other. The female mind, as well as form, is naturally more &s;oft and delicate; the &s;pirits more bri&s;k and volatile; the heart more immedi|ately &s;u&s;ceptible of pain or plea&s;ure than our own: as their frame can boa&s;t of finer harmony, &s;ymmetry and propor|tion, though of le&s;s &s;trength, firmne&s;s and activity, in the &s;ame manner, the &s;entiments of the &s;ofter &s;ex abound in a peculiar tenderne&s;s, delicacy and viva|city: if they are not &s;olid, they are re|fined; if they are not correct, they are lively; if they are not ju&s;t and &s;erious, they are natural and chearful; to each is imparted by the providence of God that which the other &s;tands in need of: man was born to govern, to
<PB N="141" REF="139">
guard and protect; women to obey, to plea&s;e, and to reward. When men, therefore, &s;ink into &s;loth and effemi|nacy, and women a&s;&s;ume a ma&s;culine boldne&s;s and audacity, they are acting contrary to the de&s;igns of nature, and of God; and can never be the ob|jects of e&s;teem or approbation, much le&s;s of love or affection. Whil&s;t, like neighbouring monarchs, they are care|ful to remain in their own territories, and do not encroach on each other's borders, they will be re&s;pected as law|ful &s;overeigns: but when, like u&s;urpers, they invade the rights and privileges of each other, they will be treated as &s;uch; and whil&s;t they are employed in the conque&s;t of kingdoms which do not belong to them, will be deprived of their own.</P>
<P>PASS we on, then, to that be&s;t ce|ment of dome&s;tic happine&s;s, mutual for|bearance and complacency; and the&s;e, per|haps,
<PB N="142" REF="140">
like con&s;tancy and fidelity, are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, more nece&s;&s;ary on the part of the wife, than of the hu&s;band.</P>
<P>THOSE who have the management and direction of affairs, whatever &s;ta|tion, bu&s;ine&s;s or profe&s;&s;ion they are en|gaged in, mu&s;t meet with various cro&s;&s;es, misfortunes and di&s;appointments: the ways of this life are, at be&s;t, but rugged and uneven; briars and thorns &s;pring up on every &s;ide of us: and, even the mo&s;t flowery and delightful paths are full of danger; man, therefore, as mo&s;t able, is appointed to perform the journey. The greate&s;t part of the world are forced to gain their living by the &s;weat of their brow: the toil and labour of providing for his hou&s;hold, of acquiring what is nece&s;&s;ary and convenient, falls to the lot of the indu&s;trious hu&s;band. Too well we know, that in an evil and cor|rupt world, the be&s;t intentions, and the mo&s;t hone&s;t endeavours of the be&s;t men
<PB N="143" REF="141">
may be fru&s;trated; lo&s;&s;es, vexations and troubles are perpetually ari&s;ing: &s;uch accidents, and &s;uch we are every day liable to, will &s;ower the &s;weete&s;t di&s;po&s;itions, throw a gloom over the chearfule&s;t face, and fill the firme&s;t heart with angui&s;h and di&s;quietude. How then, is the good and virtuous wife, the partner of his joys and &s;orrows, to behave in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s? Is &s;he to reproach his melan|choly, to inflame his pa&s;&s;ion, to embit|ter his di&s;quietude? or, is &s;he, on the other hand, to endeavour to calm his &s;orrows and &s;ooth his affliction, to con|&s;ider the wounds of adver&s;ity which pain him as received in her &s;ervice, the di&s;|quietude which he feels, endured for her &s;ake? Is &s;he not to give way to that pe|tulancy or anger which appears in him? to e&s;teem it, not as the natural inmate of his brea&s;t, but as an importunate, intrud|ing &s;tranger, brought thither by misfor|tunes and di&s;appointments: the greater, therefore, his &s;orrows are, the greater
<PB N="144" REF="142">
&s;hould be her care to remove them; her tenderne&s;s &s;hould encrea&s;e in proportion to his di&s;quietude, her forbearance to his warmth, her complacency to his un|ea&s;ine&s;s: her &s;miles are to make amends for the frowns of the world, and her love and kindne&s;s to compen&s;ate for its hatred and ingratitude.</P>
<P>BUT, all tho&s;e branches of conjugal duty, which are above enumerated, mu&s;t proceed from that great &s;ource of happi|ne&s;s, true and genuine affection. Love, as I ob&s;erved to you in a preceding di&s;cour&s;e, is the active, enlivening, invigorating principle, which mu&s;t &s;et in motion the whole circle of relative duties; with|out this, neither child nor father, &s;ervant nor ma&s;ter, can acquit them&s;elves well and faithfully, in the di&s;charge of their duty: but, if in them it is requi&s;ite, in that which is now before us, it is indi&s;|pen&s;ible: in them it mu&s;t pre&s;ide and
<PB N="145" REF="143">
direct; but in this, it mu&s;t it&s;elf operate con&s;tantly, &s;teadily and invariably. But it often happens, that indifference holds the place of affection; and that tho&s;e, who &s;hould be mo&s;t &s;olicitous about each other's welfare and happine&s;s, are mo&s;t carele&s;s of it: a &s;tate &s;o unde|&s;irable, is an emblem of that natural &s;leep we &s;o often experience, when the &s;oul of man is benumm'd and &s;tupified, when nature performs her office and operations with heavine&s;s and reluctance. In&s;tead of being &s;urprized, therefore, that &s;o many are unhappy, it &s;hould rather rai&s;e our admiration to find &s;o few. When we reflect on the incon&s;iderable number of tho&s;e who are joined by love and affec|tion; when we con&s;ider, that half the world are united by ambition, pride, &s;elf-intere&s;t, force or artifice, how is it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be ble&s;t? Shall we not rather wonder to &s;ee the chain &s;o durable as it is, when the links which
<PB N="146" REF="144">
compo&s;e it are of &s;o weak a nature? From the want of, or from the lo&s;s of affection, flow all tho&s;e cares and jea|lou&s;ies, all tho&s;e troubles and animo&s;ities, which break the bands of nuptial har|mony, and poi&s;on the fountain of dome&s;|tic happine&s;s: Without this, indeed, fidelity hath no proper &s;upport to re&s;t it|&s;elf on, prudence, no end to promote, ten|derne&s;s and complacency, no object to em|ploy them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of; where|as, on the other hand, where this is, &s;carce any thing el&s;e ean be wanted: it improves the charms of beauty where it is, and &s;upplies the place where it is not; it commands re&s;pect and obedience from the ob&s;tinate and perver&s;e, con&s;tancy from the mo&s;t incon&s;tant, di&s;cretion from the mo&s;t indi&s;creet; it poli&s;hes the indelicate, &s;oftens the rude, humbles the proud and haughty; it adds, in &s;hort, to the bloom of youth, health and plenty; and gives vigour, joy and plea|&s;ure,
<PB N="147" REF="145">
even to old age, &s;ickne&s;s and ad|ver&s;ity.</P>
<P>BUT la&s;tly:</P>
<P>THE good wife &s;hould be <HI>pious</HI>;</P>
<P>Religion is the great bond which links together, and unites every virtue: piety will en&s;ure fidelity, enforce obedience, encourage prudence, increa&s;e tenderne&s;s, and double affection. When the duty to a hu&s;band is con&s;idered, as it ought to be con&s;idered, as a duty to God al&s;o, then, and then only, will it be duly and punctually performed: &s;he, indeed, can never be a good wife, who is not a good chri&s;tian. It is not to be expec|ted, that &s;he who pays no deference or re&s;pect to her Creator and her God, will obey her lord and hu&s;band; or that &s;he will ever &s;ubmit her&s;elf to human ordi|nances, who neglects the divine: whil&s;t, on the other hand, &s;he who is pious and religious, will at the &s;ame time that &s;he
<PB N="148" REF="146">
is making her&s;elf amiable in the &s;ight of man, recommend her&s;elf to the favour and protection of God. If her hu&s;band is in&s;en&s;ible of her affection, God will not be &s;o; if he forgetteth, God will remember; if he is ungrateful, God will reward her.</P>

<P>THE <HI>good wife</HI> then, is one, who ever mindful of the &s;olemn contract which &s;he hath entered into, is &s;trictly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly virtuous, con&s;tant, and faithful to her hu&s;band; cha&s;te, pure, and unblemi&s;hed in every thought, word and deed: &s;he is humble and mode&s;t from rea&s;on and conviction, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive from choice, and obedient from incli|nation: what &s;he acquires by love and tenderne&s;s, &s;he pre&s;erves by prudence

and di&s;cretion: &s;he makes it her bu&s;i|ne&s;s to &s;erve, and her plea&s;ure to oblige her hu&s;band; as con&s;cious, that every thing which promotes his happine&s;s, mu&s;t in the end, contribute to her own: her tenderne&s;s relieves his cares, her affections &s;oftens his di&s;tre&s;s, her good humour and complacency le&s;&s;en and &s;ubdue his afflictions: <HI>&s;he openeth her mouth,</HI> as Solomon &s;ays, <HI>with wi&s;dom, and in her tongue is the law of kindne&s;s: &s;he looketh well to the ways of her hu&s;band, and eateth not the bread of idlene&s;s: her children ri&s;e up and call her ble&s;&s;ed: her hu&s;band al&s;o, and he prai&s;eth her.</HI> La&s;t|ly, as a good and pious chri&s;tian, &s;he looks up with an eye gratitude to the great di&s;pen&s;er and di&s;po&s;er of all things, to the hu&s;band of the widow, and father of the fatherle&s;s, intreat|ing his divine favour and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this and every other moral and religious duty; well &s;atisfied, that if &s;he duly and punctually di&s;charges her &s;everal

<P>THE gracious providence of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VII.</NOTE> which is always anxious for our welfare, and &s;olicitous for our pre&s;ervation, hath ordained that all tho&s;e ties and relations in human life, which con&s;titute part of our duty, &s;hould likewi&s;e tend to our intere&s;t and happine&s;s; and that the &s;ame love and affection, which make us agreeable to each other, &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, render us amiable in the &s;ight of God:
<PB N="154" REF="151">
and among&s;t the&s;e there is not perhaps any which &s;eems to demand our grati|tude in a &s;tronger manner, than that rational and intimate connection which is now before us; the connection of man and wife: an in&s;titution, which &s;o vi&s;ibly carries with it the mark of divine ap|probation, and is dignified by the &s;anction of the mo&s;t high. It is indeed among&s;t tho&s;e privileges which &s;eem mo&s;t peculiarly to di&s;tingui&s;h man from the inferior parts of the creation: whil&s;t brutes indulge them&s;elves in the unre&s;trained freedom of &s;en&s;ual appe|tite, and &s;atisfy their lu&s;ts and de&s;ires without delicacy or di&s;tinction, man makes u&s;e of his rea&s;on to direct his choice, to fix it on &s;ome favourite indi|vidual, there to confine all his cares, and center all his affection, <HI>and they two,</HI> as the &s;cripture expre&s;&s;eth it, <HI>become one fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="152">HAVING already therefore treated on the duty of wives to hu&s;bands, I pro|ceed now to con&s;ider that reciprocal love, regard, and e&s;teem, which are due from the hu&s;band to the wife.</P>

<P>LOVE, as I took occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve to you, is the great corner &s;tone, on which mu&s;t always be rai&s;ed the foun|dation of dome&s;tic happine&s;s; to form
<PB N="156" REF="153">
this attachment therefore, it is fir&s;t and above all things nece&s;&s;ary, that a par|tial affection be contracted towards the per&s;on; and as this mu&s;t depend in a great mea&s;ure on external appearance, the gracious providence of God hath &s;o ordained, that the opinions and ta&s;tes of men, with regard to outward forms, &s;hould be as various as the forms them|&s;elves; what &s;trikes one with the idea of beauty may &s;hock another by an ap|pearance of deformity: thus doth ima|gination in this ca&s;e &s;upply the place of truth and rea&s;on, and even the decep|tion of our &s;en&s;es contribute to the en|joyment of them. The &s;ame benefi|cent power, which produced order out of chaos, and which commands the jarring elements to bring forth harmo|ny, hath al&s;o from the various inclina|tions of different minds, and the way|ward deci&s;ions of arbitrary fancy, con|trived to promote the general and uni|ver&s;al happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="154">IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that, in the choice of many, too great a regard is paid to external appearances; the lu&s;tre of beauty is apt to dazzle, and the &s;prightline&s;s of wit is apt to betray; men for the mo&s;t part are &s;uch poor architects as to build the &s;tructure of dome&s;tic happine&s;s on a very weak and tottering foundation, when the pillars which are to &s;upport it mu&s;t of cour&s;e moulder and decay; it is a hou&s;e built upon the &s;and, the waves of jealou&s;y and anger break in upon it, the &s;torms of &s;ickne&s;s and of age beat upon that hou&s;e, and it falls. La&s;ting materials &s;hould doubtle&s;s be &s;ought for, where la&s;ting happine&s;s is propo&s;ed; qualities and perfections, not glaring but u&s;eful, not &s;hining but &s;olid, &s;uch as are calcu|lated not merely to adorn and beautify, but to &s;trengthen and enrich the edifice.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="155">A PARTIAL and &s;trong attachment therefore to the form and manners, an affectionate e&s;teem of the qualities and di&s;po&s;ition of the woman is ab&s;olutely and indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to conjugal felicity: both parties, therefore, I cannot but think, have in this point an indi&s;|putable right to judge for them&s;elves, and where they do not, we find by con&s;tant experience, there is no la&s;ting felicity; nothing indeed can be more unrea&s;onable than the arbitrary com|mands and interpo&s;ition of parental authority in this re&s;pect; <HI>tho&s;e whom God hath joined let no man put a&s;un|der,</HI> and the command when revers'd is perhaps equally binding, tho&s;e whom God hath put a&s;under let no man join; let none pretend to unite tho&s;e whom different pa&s;&s;ions, &s;entiments, tempers, and inclinations &s;eem, by nature de|&s;igned to &s;eparate from each other.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="156">FROM this partial affection to the per&s;on proceeds, and from that alone can proceed, the next great and e&s;&s;ential virtue in the hu&s;band, fidelity: the want of this doth indeed naturally di&s;unite the bonds of wedlock, and utterly incapacitate both from the lea&s;t enjoyment of mutual happine&s;s, and yet how many among&s;t us are unpar|donably carele&s;s and guilty in this im|portant article!</P>
<P>INFIDELITY on the part of the hu&s;band is indeed grown &s;o univer&s;al, that its oppo&s;ite virtue is almo&s;t out of countenance; it is treated as venial by one &s;ex, and &s;ubmitted to as unavoid|able by the other; the world is &s;o com|plai&s;ant as to &s;tile it gallantry, and becau&s;e it is known to be fa&s;hionable, it is not condemned as unlawful: thus vice is palliated with the name of error, and that which is in reality the highe&s;t di&s;grace to our nature, is con&s;idered as
<PB N="160" REF="157" MS="y">
an ornament of it. Cu&s;tom hath, I know not how, given a kind of &s;anction to it on one &s;ide, and at the &s;ame time con|demned it on the other; as if God had, like man, made his laws with partiality and inju&s;tice, and that the &s;eventh commandment were enjoined only again&s;t the weaker ve&s;&s;el; but let tho&s;e who thus mi&s;erably deceive them|&s;elves remember, that the &s;ame &s;olemn contract hath engaged both: that if they neglect the obligation, and &s;purn at the command, it is not the injured wife alone who will re&s;ent the infringe|ment of it: good men will con&s;ider it as an outrage again&s;t virtue here; and God will a&s;&s;uredly puni&s;h it as &s;uch hereafter.</P>
<P>BUT to affection and fidelity, the good hu&s;band mu&s;t al&s;o add tenderne&s;s and delicacy. It is the good-nature and complacency of the ho&s;t, which makes the plea&s;ure of the conque&s;t; and in the
<PB N="161" REF="158">
manner of conferring a favour, there is al|mo&s;t as much merit as in the be&s;towing it. The hu&s;band, therefore, is to con&s;ider not how much, but to whom he gives; not what he &s;peaks only, but to whom it is &s;poken: in his behaviour to his wife, the heart mu&s;t &s;eem to follow the hand, and the mind to direct the tongue; he &s;hould &s;uit that delicacy which he would oblige, and imitate that elegance which he would plea&s;e. To a wife, mere civility is coldne&s;s, and, mere com|plai&s;ance is indifference; to her a more expre&s;&s;ive kindne&s;s &s;hould add a grace to every word, and a peculiar tenderne&s;s diffu&s;e it&s;elf over every action. It is, indeed, this behaviour alone, which can &s;often and temper the rudene&s;s of ma&s;|culine &s;everity, and give a poli&s;h to the rougher manners of one half of man|kind; it is this tender commerce, and this delicate connection, which throws a lu&s;tre over the conver&s;ation of the ci|vilized

<P>HALF the mi&s;eries and di&s;quietudes, half the interruptions of conjugal peace and dome&s;tic felicity ari&s;e from de&s;ires too ardent, and hopes too &s;anguine; both parties, at their fir&s;t entrance into the nuptial &s;tate, e&s;pecially in youth, are apt to form to them&s;elves ideas, very inadequate and di&s;proportioned to the condition of human life; to entertain delu&s;ive notions of a romantic and vi|&s;ionary paradi&s;e, where the earth is cloathed with perpetual verdure, the flowers never fade, and the fruits are immortal; but when, in&s;tead of this,
<PB N="163" REF="160">
they begin, perhaps in a &s;hort time, to feel the thorns &s;pringing up under their feet, when they perceive the fruits to wi|ther, and the verdure to decay, they are filled with unrea&s;onable wonder and a&s;to|ni&s;hment; they had accu&s;tomed them|&s;elves to look for nothing le&s;s than unin|terrupted health, con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;s, invari|able harmony and affection: they &s;uffer, therefore, not &s;o much from the evil which they have as from the want of that which they have not. At the begin|ning of the voyage, the &s;ky is generally clear, the waters calm and unruffled; but, to conclude from thence, that we are to &s;ail through life, without &s;torm or tempe&s;t, is, to the la&s;t degree, ab|&s;urd and unrea&s;onable. It is the duty and the intere&s;t of both therefore, and e&s;pecially of him who &s;its at the helm, to prepare again&s;t the wor&s;t, to &s;teer the ve&s;&s;el with all po&s;&s;ible care and dili|gence, and conduct it &s;afely into the harbour of peace and felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="161">PROCEED we then to another nece&s;|&s;ary branch of the hu&s;band's duty, good-nature and indulgence. In a world &s;o full of mi&s;eries and misfortunes, errors and inadvertencies, pa&s;&s;ions and follies, differences both in opinion and practice mu&s;t ari&s;e, where the connection is clo&s;e and intimate; mutual complacency and forbearance, therefore, are ab&s;olutely and indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in the married &s;tate; power is never &s;o amiable, as when cloathed with meekne&s;s and hu|mility; and the &s;uperiority of our own under&s;tanding will be always mo&s;t evi|dent, when it conde&s;cends to forgive or to relieve the weakne&s;s of another. When women offend, therefore, they are to be con&s;idered as women; as beings who&s;e power and faculties are not &s;o exten&s;ive, who&s;e judgment and rea&s;on are not &s;o &s;trong and &s;olid as our own; who&s;e experience is confined with|in
<PB N="165" REF="162">
a much narrower circle; who&s;e un|der&s;tandings are limited and enfeebled by education; who are liable therefore, with the greater ea&s;e to be &s;educed or impo&s;ed on; not &s;ufficiently aware of arts which they are them&s;elves igno|rant of; nor upon their guard again&s;t that guilt, which they never practice.</P>
<P>VANITY and extravagance are the &s;tale and trite excu&s;es for cruelty, in|con&s;tancy, and inhumanity in the wor&s;t of hu&s;bands; and yet, certain it is, that he who is the cau&s;e ought not to mur|mur at the effect; and he who makes his own mi&s;ery, hath no right to com|plain of it: what &s;hall we &s;ay, if the weeds, which thus overun the garden, are planted there and cultivated too by our own hands? Flattery, too lavi&s;hly be&s;towed, will naturally produce that pride which is thus condemned; and that pride enflamed and encouraged
<PB N="166" REF="163">
will as naturally beget luxury and ex|travagance; is it not mo&s;t ab&s;urd then to be &s;urpri&s;ed that the idol expects wor&s;hip, when men have taken &s;o much pains to rai&s;e it; or that when they have been at &s;uch expence to feed a vice, they &s;hould be a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ize and the increa&s;e of it?</P>
<P>IF the hu&s;band is already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of love, fidelity, tenderne&s;s, prudence, and good-nature, he will always remember that mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of his duty to his wife, which con&s;i&s;ts in the care and protection of her, in providing for and maintaining her, as well as his &s;itua|tion, rank, and circum&s;tances in life will permit.</P>
<P>THE &s;uperior &s;trength, power, and capacities of one &s;ex, as I have before ob&s;erved to you, were originally de|&s;igned to protect and pre&s;erve the other: woman is left by nature, weak and de|fencele&s;s,
<PB N="167" REF="164">
unable to &s;truggle with the troubles and difficulties, or contend with the fraud and malice of an ill-natured and de&s;igning world: on man, who is more able, &s;he mu&s;t rely for aid and &s;upport; this aid and &s;upport, this ne|ce&s;&s;ary care and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the hu&s;band is bound con&s;tantly to afford her: he receives her, for the mo&s;t part, from the hands of tho&s;e, under who&s;e wing &s;he had till that time been &s;afe and happy; from tho&s;e who&s;e goodne&s;s he promi&s;eth to &s;upply, and who&s;e indulgence he hath &s;worn to imitate: he &s;natches her from the bo&s;om of parental tenderne&s;s to feed and cheri&s;h her in his own: as he hath taken her therefore from one protection, it is incumbent on him to provide her with another: to give her, without &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s or reluctance, as her indi&s;putable right, a &s;hare of all that he hath, of all the good things which God hath plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon him; &s;he
<PB N="168" REF="165" MS="y">
hath an undoubted claim to all his joys and plea&s;ures, and he hath no right to withhold any thing from her, but his &s;orrows and misfortunes.</P>
<P>WITHOUT &s;ome degree of &s;obriety, vigilance, and a&s;&s;iduity, a man cannot provide the nece&s;&s;aries and convenien|cies of life for him&s;elf; and the diffi|culty will of cour&s;e increa&s;e, in pro|portion to the number of tho&s;e he is to take care of: diligence and frugality therefore are in a hu&s;band, qualities e&s;|&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary; becau&s;e the welfare and happine&s;s of the whole family depends upon him: if he falls, he falls like Samp&s;on, and drags after him the ruins of the whole building.</P>
<P>BUT, true love and affection is not con|fined within the narrow bounds of our own exi&s;tence; extends it&s;elf to fu|ture times, and lives, as it were, beyond the grave. The good hu&s;band therefore,
<PB N="169" REF="166">
will think him&s;elf bound, not only to provide for and maintain the wife of his bo&s;om whil&s;t &s;he remains there, but al&s;o when he is &s;eparated from her; not only during his own life, but her's al&s;o: he will endeavour to re&s;erve, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;uch a provi&s;ion for her future &s;upport, comfort and &s;atisfaction, as may make her le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of his lo&s;s, but more &s;o of his unalterable regard and affection for her.</P>
<P>THE widow and the fatherle&s;s do, &s;urely of all, mo&s;t de&s;erve relief and commi&s;eration, and though they &s;ome|times may, yet it is but too certain they do not always meet with it; what is the bu&s;ine&s;s of one, is generally neglec|ted by all; men have connections of their own which demand their attention; it is no wonder therefore, that the cries of the widow are not heard, nor her tears regarded: becau&s;e, the very &s;ame rea|&s;on which made one &s;o careful of and &s;o anxious for her whil&s;t he lived, is the
<PB N="170" REF="167">
very rea&s;on why &s;o many neglect her when he is no more: her circum&s;tance at the be&s;t, is the lot of angui&s;h and di&s;quietude: with all that the hu&s;band can do, &s;he mu&s;t be wretched; and the lea&s;t he can do, is to take care that &s;he &s;hall not be de&s;titute. The pro|vi&s;ion &s;hould be proportioned, moreover, to her &s;ituation in life; the better &s;he always hath lived, the better he &s;hould take care &s;he always &s;hould live: the longer &s;he hath been u&s;ed to affluence and plenty, the le&s;s, no doubt, will &s;he be able to &s;truggle with penury and want: her pre&s;ent happine&s;s, where no provi&s;ion is made, can only contribute to her future mi&s;ery; and the joys which are pa&s;t, will embitter the &s;orrows that are to come. This, therefore, is a duty which love will always dictate, and gra|titude in&s;pire. It may be &s;aid, indeed, by the low and &s;elfi&s;h, that where we do not receive, we are not obliged to pay; that death cancels this and every
<PB N="171" REF="168">
other bond; but &s;urely, to the noble and di&s;intere&s;ted mind, there is a plea|&s;ure in promoting other's happine&s;s, even when it is no longer conducive to our own: and it is always more gene|rous to be&s;tow a favour where we can never expect a return for it.</P>
<P>But if frugality, indu&s;try, and &s;obriety are requi&s;ite in a hu&s;band, &s;o al&s;o above all are piety and virtue.</P>
<P>WOMEN are generally re&s;pected and e&s;teemed in the world, according to the merit and character of their hu&s;bands: for her &s;ake therefore, as well as for his own, he &s;hould be more than ordinarily careful to pre&s;erve his reputation un|&s;potted, and to maintain his honour and integrity inviolable: the world may be ill-natured enough to impute his errors to her advice, and his defects to her example: if he is carele&s;s, &s;he will be reproached; if he is vicious, &s;he will be
<PB N="172" REF="169">
condemned; his follies will make her contemptible, and his vices render her unhappy. Thus, the innocence of the one may &s;uffer for the guilt of the other; and tho&s;e who have not committed the crime be involved in the puni&s;hment of it. If the hu&s;band loves his wife there|fore, he will be virtuous and good, that &s;he may be honoured and re&s;pected: if he loves his wife, he will be pious and religious, that he may make her pious and religious al&s;o. And to this end, it is highly nece&s;&s;ary, though it is not al|ways attended to, that hu&s;band and wife be as much united as po&s;&s;ible, with re|gard to their religious &s;entiments; that they <HI>walk together in the hou&s;e of God as friends.</HI> Difference of opinion in this important point will naturally create and draw along with it difference in others; and doubtle&s;s, where happine&s;s is to depend on union and harmony, we &s;hould be careful to remove every po&s;&s;ible cau&s;e of di&s;&s;ention.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="170">To &s;um up all therefore, in the cha|racter of</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A GOOD HUSBAND.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>good hu&s;band</HI> is one, who, wed|ded not by intere&s;t but by choice, is con&s;tant as well from inclination as from principle: he treats his wife with deli|cacy as a woman, with tenderne&s;s as a friend: he attributes her follies to her weakne&s;s, her imprudence to her inad|vertency; he pa&s;&s;es them over there|fore with good-nature, and pardons them with indulgence: all his care and indu&s;try are employed for her welfare; all his &s;trength and power are exerted for her &s;upport and protection; he is more anxious to pre&s;erve his own cha|racter and reputation, becau&s;e her's is blended with it: la&s;tly, the good hu&s;|band is pious and religious, that he may animate her faith by his practice, and
<PB N="174" REF="171">
enforce the precepts of chri&s;tianity by his own example: that, as they join to promote each other's happine&s;s in this world, they may unite to in&s;ure eternal joy and felicity in that which is to come.</P>
<P>TO CONCLUDE.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured in this and the preceding di&s;cour&s;es, to illu&s;trate and explain what are generally termed, the RELATIVE DUTIES: a matter of the ut|mo&s;t con&s;equence to &s;ociety, as on the punctual di&s;charge of them, the felicity of all mankind, doth in a great mea|&s;ure depend. If they were univer&s;ally, regularly, and faithfully performed, the world would no longer be a &s;cene of vice, mi&s;ery and confu&s;ion, but a de|licious paradi&s;e, the &s;eat of joy and hap|pine&s;s, and no imperfect emblem of that ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate, which the good and vir|tuous will not fail to inherit hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="172">You will ea&s;ily perceive, my bre|thren, that I have purpo&s;ely avoided entering into tho&s;e minuter parts of every duty which mu&s;t depend on the various ranks, circum&s;tances and condi|tions of human life; I have only &s;ketch'd as it were, the outlines, which mu&s;t be filled up and fini&s;hed by your own &s;en&s;e and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In the mean time, let us put up our prayers to the &s;upreme di&s;pen&s;er of every good gift, that he will a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the performance of the&s;e moral and reli|gious duties; that he will in&s;pire our hearts with that love and benevolence, that care and indu&s;try, that zeal and a&s;|&s;iduity which are nece&s;&s;ary in the di&s;|charge of them; that children and pa|rents, &s;ervants and ma&s;ters, wives and hu&s;bands, may all punctually and regu|larly perform the ta&s;k appointed for
<PB N="176" REF="173">
them, which alone can promote their ea&s;e, &s;atisfaction, and happine&s;s here, and &s;ecure eternal joy and felicity here|after.</P>
