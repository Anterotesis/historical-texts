<HEAD>A LETTER TO <HI>R&mdash;B&mdash;</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was not many Days ago that I wrote you a Letter upon the Sub|ject of your Comedy now upon the point of being acted at <HI>Drury-lane</HI> The|atre. As I had Rea&s;ons for not di&s;|clo&s;ing
<PB N="4" REF="3">
my&s;elf, I did not &s;ub&s;cribe my Name to it; my Coun&s;el of cour&s;e was de&s;pi&s;ed. However, I am not one of tho&s;e anonymous Letter-Writers, who are to be di&s;couraged by one Rebuff; for as my Motive, contrary to the U&s;age of my Fraternity, was a good one, and had your Benefit in view, I &s;hall for your &s;ake per&s;i&s;t in it, and addre&s;s you now in a more earne&s;t and more public manner, than in my la&s;t.</P>
<P>Your Piece was la&s;t Winter put into my Hands by a Friend, without any Account whence he came by it. I read it through more than once, and it was upon my own Knowledge of it that I gave you my Advice not to produce it at our Summer Theatre; at the &s;ame
<PB N="5" REF="4">
time wi&s;hing you to re&s;erve it till the Winter, when it might be &s;ecure of a better Repre&s;entation. This I &s;aid, not in the lea&s;t doubting but that the Ma|nager of either Theatre would accept it gladly and without He&s;itation. Since then to my inconceivable Surprize I have been informed that it was offered and re|fu&s;ed at both Theatres. This accounts for the manner in which I got a &s;ight of it; for it is plain, while it ought to have been in the Hands of its re&s;pectable Judges Mr. * * * and Mr. * * * it mi|grated into tho&s;e of other People, who have no manner of Connection with them.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s to you, Sir, I was never more &s;urprized in my Life than when I heard
<PB N="6" REF="5">
this Account. My Surprize however car|ried an Exception to it in the Per&s;on of Mr. * * *; for I might have con&s;idered that as he has long been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t Name for tho&s;e agile Perform|ances in which our mute Harlequin ex|cells, it was not at all likely he &s;hould countenance any Inva&s;ion upon his Me|rit. The dangerous Tendency of this Innovation might ju&s;tly alarm him, le&s;t all that illu&s;trious Collection of Birds and Bea&s;ts, Witches and Wire-Dancers, of which he enjoys the ine&s;timable Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, might be rendered u&s;ele&s;s and con|temptible; and in the end the Perform|ances of the Head (contrary to all Cu&s;|tom and U&s;age) be made of more Digni|ty than the Operations of the Heels. This Inver&s;ion of things I might have
<PB N="7" REF="6">
thought that experienced Practitioner could never approve of; and indeed how you or your Friends could think of tendering a Piece to him of &s;uch a Nature I can't well conceive.</P>
<P>But that any one who profe&s;&s;es him|&s;elf a man of Ta&s;te, a Lover of the Belles Lettres, a &s;overeign Critic in Dra|matic Performances, and one who is him&s;elf a Dabbler in the Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hould &s;o far forget him&s;elf, as to reject a Work of &s;o much Wit and Ingenuity, &s;o much Novelty, and &s;uch inimitable Raillery, &s;taggered me beyond mea&s;ure, and I was led almo&s;t to think I had mi&s;taken its Merit, and formed too favorable an Opinion of it. While I was thus wa|vering, and almo&s;t upon the Point of
<PB N="8" REF="7">
receding from my Opinion; I received &s;uch a Confirmation of my Judgment, by the Reception it had met with from &s;ome of the mo&s;t celebrated Wits of the Age, as put an End to my Doubts at once, and left me at a lo&s;s what Mo|tive to a&s;cribe its Rejection to. That it &s;hould &s;pring from Want of Ta&s;te and Di&s;cernment I was loth to believe; that Jealou&s;y or Want of Candor was the Cau&s;e, I was &s;till inclined to think; e&s;|pecially when I recollected what half|formed mi&s;hapen Productions, that Gen|tleman had of late too frequently gave Birth to, with a Compliance, which although it carried the Appearance of Good Nature with it, certainly did no Credit to his Judgment. This Ea&s;ine&s;s of Temper to Authors of le&s;s Merit, led
<PB N="9" REF="8">
me to believe that there could be no Ob|&s;tacle to your Succe&s;s; and though I knew him ab&s;olute in his Deci&s;ions, I flattered my&s;elf he would be ju&s;t. The Event convinced me of my Mi&s;take, and the Conclu&s;ions I draw from it are &s;uch, as I never admit without Regret.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ons, Sir, whom you have had the good Fortune to plea&s;e, are &s;uch, I under&s;tand, who&s;e Names do honour not only to every one under their Protection, but to the Country to which they belong&mdash;nay, (if I am not mi&s;-informed) I may add a Name to the Li&s;t, a truly Royal one, who&s;e Approbation I dare believe you e&s;teem above any earthly Favour or Enjoyment what&s;oever; this Approba|tion I am told was accompanied with a
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Liberality peculiar to him&s;elf, which though it could &s;carce enhance your Happine&s;s, I make no doubt increa&s;ed his own. Thus di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Applau&s;e as well as Bounty of your So|vereign, it would be ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e you any longer regret the Rejection you met with in your Application to the Theatre. If you received any thing like Mortification on that Occa&s;ion, it is now reflected back upon him who occa&s;ioned it, and who had not Ta&s;te to di&s;cern that Merit, which your Sovereign was plea&s;ed to reward. The happy Aera is now commenced, which if any one alive has cau&s;e to regret, it can be he only who&s;e Decrees are no longer ab&s;olute, and who&s;e Deci&s;ions are now made liable to be rever&s;ed; his Monopoly is de&s;troy|ed:
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Men of Wit and Genius have now a new Channel open to their Productions, and he who was before the &s;upreme Cen&s;or of their Works, will now be re|duced to his proper Profe&s;&s;ion, and be|come the &s;ub&s;ervient In&s;trument in the Repre&s;entation of them.</P>
<P>The Complaint that there are no Co|medies wrote in this Age, does not in my Opinion reflect upon our Writers, but is the Con&s;equence of our Manners. There are no longer any glaring Characters among&s;t us; modern Refinements have poli&s;hed away all tho&s;e humourous Pe|culiarities which &s;upplied Topics of Ri|dicule to the Pens of <HI>Shake&s;pear, John|&s;on</HI> and <HI>Fletcher;</HI> even <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Beau no longer exi&s;ts. Our Cotemporaries think
<PB N="12" REF="11">
they have conjured up a fre&s;h Spirit of Humour in the Pa&s;&s;ion of Jealou&s;y; it may be &s;o; but it is no Mark of the Times; no body is jealous now-a-days; Thanks to the Wives of this Age, they prevent all that painful and excruciating Uncertainty which a more guarded Be|haviour might occa&s;ion. The Comic Writer is now left without Materials: even the Court, his never-failing Re|&s;ource for Invective, is now &s;o formed, as to afford no Employment for his Pen, unle&s;s he &s;teps out of his Office, and commences Panegyri&s;t. In this Dearth of Characters I think great Prai&s;e is due to you, Sir, who have attempted to in|troduce among&s;t us the&s;e whim&s;ical Re|cruits, and to tran&s;plant the Wit of <HI>Italy</HI> into your native Climate. I will not
<PB N="13" REF="12">
venture to &s;ay your Attempt will &s;ucceed, and for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, Fir&s;t, becau&s;e Im|provement is as hard to introduce in this Country, as Prejudice is found difficult to remove. Secondly, our Engli&s;h Har|lequin being in general as great a Fa|vourite with the Mob, as our Engli&s;h Punchinello is, I conclude that every Man who can jump through a Hoop him|&s;elf, or who delights to &s;ee another do it, will &s;et his Face again&s;t your Inter|loper. Thirdly, there being no Feats of Agility in your Piece, by which your Performers are put in manife&s;t Danger of their Lives, I cannot &s;ee how it is po&s;&s;ible the Galleries can &s;et it out. Fourthly, and la&s;tly; from its being ad|mired by all People who have Ta&s;te, and the Oppo&s;ition it has received from
<PB N="14" REF="13">
tho&s;e who have none, I conclude it will be damned by a very great Majority.</P>
<P>If in reply to the&s;e Sugge&s;tions of mine you remind me of the very powerful Pro|tection under which you are &s;heltered, I mu&s;t acquaint you that for that very Rea|&s;on every free-born Engli&s;hman who loves to di&s;appoint and in&s;ult his Betters, will be your declared Enemy and Oppo&s;er. If you object to this, that your End is an&s;wered, that happy in the Approbation you have already obtained, you are above the Cen&s;ure of the Vulgar and indifferent to their Prai&s;e, I think you judge right; and am,</P>

<SIGNED>Your's, &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
