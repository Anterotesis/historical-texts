<P>PERMIT me to take this method of thank|ing your Royal Highne&s;s, for conde&s;cend|ing to like the following Sketch. Or, in other Words, permit me to let the World know that this &s;ame Cub has been laughed at by the Duke of YORK;&mdash;has been read to your Royal High|ne&s;s by the Genius him&s;elf, and warmed by the immediate beams of your kind Indulgence.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Tale is&mdash;what very few Tales now-a-days are,&mdash;true. The Hero of it no other than the Author him&s;elf. It was indeed <HI>catching the</HI> merriment <HI>as it ro&s;e;</HI> for it was written in the New-market Coffee Room;&mdash;In which the Author, being elected a member of the Jockey Club, had the happine&s;s of pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal &s;prightly good|humoured Evenings&mdash;Ju&s;t when the whim&s;ical Adventure happened, which is here related.</P>
<P>POETICAL Licence however (and is it not right that it &s;hould be &s;o?) has been taken. Particularly, in Ju&s;tice to my own Per&s;on, I mu&s;t declare that a certain figure of Speech, called by Rhetoricians Hyperbole or Exaggeration, has been made pretty free with.</P>

MY Rea&s;ons for publi&s;hing it are twofold. One is my own: The other I borrowed from Lord SHAFTESBURY. The former is, without flattery, the merit of the Poem. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Heyday!&mdash;to be &s;ure!&mdash;why this is Impudence without a Parallel;"</Q> &s;ays &s;ome Don Choleric or another.</P>
<P>I cannot agree with you there, Sir Te&s;ty&mdash;Pardon me, Sir,&mdash;hear my Explanation. The&s;e Ver&s;es have had the honour of being approved by tho&s;e who&s;e Ta&s;te it would be the highe&s;t Arrogance in me to call in que&s;tion. Now, Sir, what have you to &s;ay to that?</P>
<P>THE latter is in order to let my friends have Copies of it, which they may be in no danger of not being able to read. And &s;urely I may be rather excu&s;ed for making the Pre&s;s my Amanuen&s;is than the noble Lord, who might have had half a dozen Secretaries at his command. If I have not al|ready &s;aid enough, fifty other rea&s;ons may be invented by my ingenious Readers.</P>
<P>AND now for the Critics&mdash;Pray, good Gentlemen, be quiet. Do not apply your confounded Squares and Com|pa&s;&s;es to a Performance, who&s;e Beauty&mdash;if it has any&mdash;but that, you know, is under&s;tood&mdash;con&s;i&s;ts in a carele&s;s ea&s;e.

at all becoming in People of your Dignity and Con&s;equence, to keep company with <HI>Cubs.</HI> What the Deuce! can't a co|mical fellow take a hearty laugh, but one of you <HI>&s;age Phi|lo&s;ophers</HI> mu&s;t clap on a pair of damnation Spectacles, and &s;tare him full in the Face, in order to find out Pimples upon his No&s;e?</P>
<P>COMMEND me, however, as much as you plea&s;e. Take full &s;cope there. And for your further encouragement, if you will tickle my fancy with a few obliging encomiums, I promi&s;e you a SCOTCH-PINT-BOTTLE of mine excellent Ho&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">At the BEDFORD-HEAD.</NOTE> WILDMAN's be&s;t Claret; which, by the by, has been facetiously reckoned no ineffectual Bribe to one formidable <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> among&s;t you.</P>
<P>JESTING apart. My dear Boy CUB! go along;&mdash;pu&s;h thy way;&mdash;&s;hift for thy&s;elf. All that is required of thee is, to relax the Mu&s;cles of &s;uch as have not got the&s;e organs of ri&s;ibility over and above con&s;tricted.&mdash;Play thy Part well; and re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of eternal applau&s;e from thy loving PROGENITOR.</P>
