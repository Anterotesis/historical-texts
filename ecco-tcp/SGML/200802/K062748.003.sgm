<P>AT four o'clock in the afternoon of Friday the 9th of Fe|bruary, having tacked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">177O. February. Friday 9. Sunday 11.</NOTE> we &s;tood S. W. and continued to make &s;ail to the &s;outhward till &s;un&s;et on the 11th, when a fre&s;h breeze at N. E. had carried us back again the length of Cape Palli&s;er, of which as the weather was clear we had a good view. Between the foot of the high land and the &s;ea there is a low flat border, off which there are &s;ome rocks that appear above water. Between this Cape and Cape Turnagain, the land near the &s;hore is, in many places, low and flat, and has a green and plea&s;ant appearance; but far|ther from the &s;ea it ri&s;es into hills. The land between

Cape Palli&s;er and Cape Tierawitte is high and makes in table-points;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Sunday 11.</NOTE> it al&s;o &s;eemed to us to form two bays, but we were at too great a di&s;tance from this part of the coa&s;t, to judge accurately from appearances. The wind having been variable, with calms, we had advanced no farther by the 12th at noon than latitude 41&deg; 52&prime;,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 12.</NOTE> Cape Palli&s;er then bearing north, di&s;tant about five leagues; and the &s;nowy mountain S. 83 W.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 13.</NOTE>At noon on the 13th, we found our&s;elves in the latitude of 42&deg; 2&prime; S.; Cape Palli&s;er bearing N. 20 E. di&s;tant eight leagues. In the afternoon, a fre&s;h gale &s;prung up at N. E. and we &s;teered S. W. by W. for the &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight, which at &s;un&s;et bore from us S. 74 W. At this time the variation was 15&deg; 4&prime; E.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 14.</NOTE>At eight o'clock in the morning of the 14th, having run one and twenty leagues S. 58 W. &s;ince the preceding noon, it fell calm. We were then abrea&s;t of the &s;nowy mountain which bore from us N. W. and in this direction lay behind a mountainous ridge of nearly the &s;ame height, which ri&s;es directly from the &s;ea, and runs parallel with the &s;hore, which lies N. E. &frac12; N. and S. W. &frac12; S. The north we&s;t end of the ridge ri&s;es inland, not far from Cape Campbell; and both the mountain and the ridge are di&s;tinctly &s;een as well from Cape Koamaroo as Cape Palli&s;er: from Koamaroo they are di&s;tant two and twenty leagues S. W. &frac12; S.; and from Cape Palli&s;er thirty leagues W. S. W.; and are of a height &s;ufficient to be &s;een at a much greater di&s;tance. At noon this day, we were in latitude 42&deg; 347&prime;S. The &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore S. W. &frac12; W.; and &s;ome low land that appeared like an i&s;land, and lay clo&s;e under the foot of the ridge, bore N. W. by N. about five or &s;ix leagues.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="8">In the afternoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Wedne&s;. 14.</NOTE> when Mr. Banks was out in the boat a &s;hooting, we &s;aw, with our gla&s;&s;es, four double canoes, hav|ing on board fifty-&s;even men, put off from that &s;hore, and make towards him: we immediately made &s;ignals for him to come on board; but the &s;hip, with re&s;pect to him, being right in the wake of the &s;un, he did not &s;ee them. We were at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hore, and he was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hip, which was between him and the &s;hore; &s;o that, it being a dead calm, I began to be in &s;ome pain for him, fearing that he might not &s;ee the ca|noes time enough to reach the &s;hip before they &s;hould get up with him: &s;oon after, however, we &s;aw his boat in motion, and had the plea&s;ure to take him on board before the Indians came up, who probably had not &s;een him, as their attention &s;eemed to be wholly fixed upon the &s;hip. They came within about a &s;tone's ca&s;t, and then &s;topped, gazing at us with a look of vacant a&s;toni&s;hment: Tupia exerted all his eloquence to prevail upon them to come nearer, but without any effect. After &s;urveying us for &s;ome time, they left us, and made towards the &s;hore; but had not mea&s;ured more than half the di&s;tance between that and the &s;hip before it was dark. We imagined that the&s;e people had heard nothing of us, and could not but remark the different behaviour and di&s;po&s;itions of the inhabitants of the different parts of this coa&s;t upon their fir&s;t approaching the ve&s;&s;el. The&s;e kept aloof with a mixture of timidity and wonder; others had immediately commenced ho&s;tilities, by pelting us with &s;tones: the gentle|man whom we had found alone, fi&s;hing in his boat, &s;eemed to think us entirely unworthy of his notice; and &s;ome, al|mo&s;t without invitation, had come on board with an air of perfect confidence and good-will. From the behaviour of our la&s;t vi&s;itors, I gave the land from which they had put
<PB N="414" REF="9">
off,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Wedne&s;. 14.</NOTE> and which, as I have before ob&s;erved, had the appear|ance of an i&s;land, the name or LOOKERS-ON.</P>
<P>At eight o'clock in the evening, a breeze &s;prung up at S.S.W. with which I &s;tretched off &s;outh ea&s;t, becau&s;e &s;ome on board thought they &s;aw land in that quarter. In this cour&s;e we continued till &s;ix o'clock the next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 15.</NOTE> when we had run eleven leagues, but &s;aw no land, except that which we had left. Having &s;tood to the S.E. with a light breeze, which veered from the we&s;t to the north, till noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 42&deg; 56&prime; S. and the high land that we were abrea&s;t of the preceding noon bore N. N. W. &frac12; W. In the afternoon we had a light breeze at N. E. with which we &s;teered we&s;t, edging in for the land, which was di&s;tant about eight leagues. At &s;even in the evening, we were about &s;ix leagues from the &s;hore, and the &s;outhermo&s;t extremity of the land in &s;ight bore W. S. W.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 16.</NOTE>At day-break on the 16th, we di&s;covered land bearing S. by W. and &s;eemingly detached from the coa&s;t we were upon. About eight, a breeze &s;prung up, at N. by E. and we &s;teered directly for it. At noon, we were in latitude 43&deg; 19&prime;S. the peak on the &s;nowy mountain bore N. 20 E. di&s;tant twenty-&s;even leagues; the &s;outhern extremity of the land we could &s;ee bore we&s;t, and the land which had been di&s;co|vered in the morning appeared like an i&s;land extending from S. S. W. to S. W. by W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant about eight leagues. In the afternoon, we &s;tood to the &s;outhward of it, with a fre&s;h breeze at north: at eight in the evening, we had run eleven leagues, and the land then extended from S. W. by W. to N. by W. We were then di&s;tant about three or four leagues from the neare&s;t &s;hore, and in this &s;ituation had fifty fathom water, with a fine &s;andy bottom. The variation of the com|pa&s;s by this morning's amplitude was 14&deg; 39&prime; E.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="10">At &s;un-ri&s;e, the next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Saturday 17.</NOTE> our opinion that the land we had been &s;tanding for was an i&s;land, was confirmed, by our &s;eeing part of the land of Tovy Poenammoo open to the we&s;tward of it, extending as far as W. by S. At eight in the morning, the extremes of the i&s;land bore N. 76 W. and N. N. E. &frac12; E.; and an opening near the &s;outh point, which had the appearance of a bay or harbour, N. 20 W. di&s;tant be|tween three and four leagues: in this &s;ituation we had thirty-eight fathom water with a brown &s;andy bottom.</P>
<P>This i&s;land, which I named after Mr. Banks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Banks's I&s;land.</NOTE> lies about five leagues from the coa&s;t of Tovy Poenammoo; the &s;outh point bears S. 21 W. from the highe&s;t peak on the &s;nowy mountain, and lies in latitude 43&deg; 32&prime; S. and in longitude 186&deg; 30&prime; W. by an ob&s;ervation of the &s;un and moon which was made this morning: it is of a circular figure, and about twenty-four leagues in compa&s;s: it is &s;ufficiently high to be &s;een at the di&s;tance of twelve or fifteen leagues, and the land has a broken irregular &s;urface, with the appearance rather of barrenne&s;s than fertility; yet it was inhabited, for we &s;aw &s;moke in one place, and a few &s;traggling natives in another.</P>
<P>When this i&s;land was fir&s;t di&s;covered in the direction of S. by W. &s;ome per&s;ons on board were of opinion that they al&s;o &s;aw land bearing S. S. E. and S. E. by E. I was my&s;elf upon the deck at the time, and told them, that in my opinion it was no more than a cloud, and that as the &s;un ro&s;e it would di&s;&s;ipate and vani&s;h. However, as I was determined to leave no &s;ubject for di&s;putation which experiment could remove, I ordered the &s;hip to be wore, and &s;teered E. S. E. by compa&s;s, in the direction which the land was &s;aid to bear from us at that time. At noon we were in latitude 44&deg; 7&prime; S.; the &s;outh point of Banks's I&s;land bearing north, di&s;tant five
<PB N="416" REF="11">
leagues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Saturday 17.</NOTE> By &s;even o'clock at night we had run eight and twenty miles, when &s;eeing no land, nor any &s;igns of any, but that which we had left, we bore away S. by W. and con|tinued upon that cour&s;e till the next day at noon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 18.</NOTE> when we were in latitude 45&deg; 16&prime;, the &s;outh point of Banks's I&s;land bearing N. 6&deg; 30&prime; W. di&s;tant twenty-eight leagues. The va|riation by the azimuth this morning was 15&deg; 30&prime; E. As no &s;igns of land had yet appeared to the &s;outhward, and as I thought that we had &s;tood far enough in that direction to weather all the land we had left, judging from the report of the natives in Queen Charlotte's Sound, I hauled to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>We had a moderate breeze at N. N. W. and N. till eight in the evening, when it became un&s;ettled; and at ten fixed at &s;outh: during the night, it blew with &s;uch violence that it brought us under our clo&s;e reefed top&s;ails. At eight the next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 19.</NOTE> having run twenty-eight leagues upon a W. by N. &frac12; N. cour&s;e, and judging our&s;elves to be to the we&s;tward of the land of Tovy Poenammoo, we bore away N. W. with a fre&s;h gale at &s;outh. At ten, having run eleven miles upon this cour&s;e, we &s;aw land extending from the S. W. to the N. W. at the di&s;tance of about ten leagues, which we hauled up for. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 44&deg; 38&prime;, the &s;outh ea&s;t point of Bank's I&s;land bore N. 58&deg; 30&prime; E. di&s;tant thirty leagues, and the main body of the land in &s;ight W. by N. A head &s;ea prevented us from making much way to the &s;outhward; at &s;even in the evening the extremes of the land &s;tretched from S. W. by S. to N. by W.; and at &s;ix leagues from the &s;hore we had thirty-two fathom wa|ter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 20.</NOTE> At four o'clock the next morning, we &s;tood in for the &s;hore W. by S. and during a cour&s;e of four leagues, our depth of water was from thirty-two to thirteen fathom.
<PB N="417" REF="12">
When it was thirteen fathom we were but three miles di&s;tant from the &s;hore, and therefore &s;tood off;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Tue&s;day 20.</NOTE> its direction is here nearly N. and S. The &s;urface, to the di&s;tance of about five miles from the &s;ea, is low and flat; but it then ri&s;es into hills of a con&s;iderable height. It appeared to be totally barren, and we &s;aw no &s;igns of its being inhabited. Our latitude, at noon, was 44&deg; 44&prime;; and the longitude which we made from Banks's I&s;land to this place was 2&deg; 22&prime; W. During the la&s;t twenty-four hours, though we carried as much &s;ail as the &s;hip would bear, we were driven three leagues to the leeward.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;tand off and on all this day and the next,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 21.</NOTE> keeping at the di&s;tance of between four and twelve leagues from the &s;hore, and having water from thirty-five to fifty-three fathom. On the 22d, at noon, we had no ob&s;ervation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 22.</NOTE> but by the land judged our&s;elves to be about three leagues farther north than we had been the day before. At &s;un-&s;et, the weather, which had been hazey, clearing up, we &s;aw a mountain which ro&s;e in a high peak, bearing N. W. by N.; and at the &s;ame time, we &s;aw the land more di&s;tinctly than before, extending from N. to S. W. by S. which, at &s;ome di&s;|tance within the coa&s;t, had a lofty and mountainous appear|ance. We &s;oon found that the accounts which had been given us by the Indians in Queen Charlotte's Sound of the land to the &s;outhward were not true; for they had told us that it might be circumnavigated in four days.</P>
<P>On the 23d,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 23.</NOTE> having a hollow &s;well from the S. E. and ex|pecting wind from the &s;ame quarter, we kept plying be|tween &s;even and fifteen leagues from the &s;hore, having from &s;eventy to forty-four fathom. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 44&deg; 40&prime; S. and our longitude from Banks's i&s;land 1&deg; 31&prime; W. From this time to &s;ix in the evening it was
<PB N="418" REF="13">
calm;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Friday 23.</NOTE> but a light breeze then &s;pringing up at E.N.E. we &s;teered S. S. E. all night, edging off from the land, the hollow &s;well &s;till continuing; our depth of water was from &s;ixty to &s;eventy-five fathom. While we were becalmed, Mr. Banks, being out in the boat, &s;hot two Port Egmont hens, which were in every re&s;pect the &s;ame as tho&s;e that are found in great numbers upon the i&s;land of Faro, and were the fir&s;t of the kind we had &s;een upon this coa&s;t, though we fell in with &s;ome a few days before we made land.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 24.</NOTE>At day-break, the wind fre&s;hened, and before noon we had a &s;trong gale at N.N.E. At eight in the morning we &s;aw the land extending as far as S. W. by S. and &s;teered directly for it. At noon, we were in latitude 45&deg; 22&prime; S.; and the land, which now &s;tretched from S. W. &frac12; S. to N.N.W. appeared to be rudely diver&s;ified by hill and valley. In the afternoon, we &s;teered S. W. by S. and S. W. edging in for the land with a fre&s;h gale at north; but though we were at no great di&s;|tance, the weather was &s;o hazey that we could &s;ee nothing di&s;tinctly upon it, except a ridge of high hills lying not far from the &s;ea, and parallel to the coa&s;t, which in this place &s;tretches S. by W. and N. by E. and &s;eemed to end in a high bluff point to the &s;outhward. By eight in the evening we were abrea&s;t of this point; but it being then dark, and I not knowing which way the land trended, we brought to for the night. At this time, the point bore we&s;t, and was di&s;tant about five miles: our depth of water was thirty-&s;even fa|thom, and the bottom con&s;i&s;ted of &s;mall pebbles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 25.</NOTE>At day-break, having made &s;ail, the point bore north, di&s;tant three leagues, and we now found that the land trended from it S. W. by W. as far as we could &s;ee. This point I named CAPE SAUNDERS, in honour of Sir Charles. Our latitude was 45&deg; 35&prime; S. and longitude 189&deg; 4&prime; W. By the latitude, and the
<PB N="419" REF="14">
angles that are made by the coa&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Sunday 25.</NOTE> this point will be &s;uffi|ciently known; there is, however, about three or four leagues to the &s;outh we&s;t of it, and very near the &s;hore, a remarkable &s;addle-hill, which is a good direction to it on that quarter. From one league to four leagues north of Cape Saunders, the &s;hore forms two or three bays, in which there appeared to be good anchorage, and effectual &s;helter from the S. W. we&s;terly, and N. we&s;terly winds; but my de&s;ire of getting to the &s;outhward, in order to a&s;certain whether this country was an i&s;land or a continent, prevented my putting into any of them.</P>
<P>We kept at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hore all this morn|ing, with the wind at S. W. and had a very di&s;tinct view of it: it is of a moderate height, and the &s;urface is broken by many hills, which are green and woody; but we &s;aw no ap|pearance of inhabitants. At noon, Cape Saunders bore N. 30 W. di&s;tant about four leagues. We had variable winds and calms till five o'clock in the evening, when it fixed at W. S.

The wind now veered from the N. to the W. and as we had fine wea|ther, and moonlight, we kept &s;tanding clo&s;e upon the wind to the S. W. all night.

As the wind was at N.

Our latitude at noon was 47&deg; 26&prime; S. The land in &s;ight, which had the appearance of an i&s;land, extended from N. E. by N. to N. W. by W. and &s;eemed to be about five leagues di&s;tant from the main; the ea&s;termo&s;t ledge of rocks bore S. S. E. di&s;tant one league and an half, and the northermo&s;t N. E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant about three leagues. This land is high and barren, with nothing upon it but a few &s;traggling &s;hrubs, for not a &s;ingle tree was to be &s;een; it was however remarkable for a number of white patches, which I took to be marble, as they reflected the &s;un's rays very &s;trongly: other patches of the &s;ame kind we had ob|&s;erved in different parts of this country, particularly in Mercury Bay: we continued to &s;tand clo&s;e upon a wind to the we&s;tward, and at &s;un-&s;et the &s;outhermo&s;t point of land bore N. 38 E. di&s;tant four leagues, and the we&s;termo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. 2 E. The point which lies in latitude 47&deg; 19&prime; S. longitude 192&deg; 12&prime; W. I named SOUTH CAPE; the we&s;termo&s;t land was a &s;mall i&s;land, lying off the point of the main.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing South Cape to be the &s;outhern extremity of this country, as indeed it proved to be, I hoped to get round it by the we&s;t, for a large hollow &s;well from the &s;outh we&s;t, ever &s;ince our la&s;t hard gale, had convinced me that there was no land in that direction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 10.</NOTE>In the night we had a hard gale at N.

W. by N. di&s;tant about five leagues: about two hours afterwards we &s;aw land a-head, upon which we tacked and &s;tood off till &s;ix, when we &s;tood in to take a nearer view of it: at eleven we were within three leagues of it, but the wind &s;eeming to incline upon the &s;hore, I tacked and &s;tood off to the &s;outhward. We had now &s;ailed round the land which we had di&s;covered on the 5th, and which then did not appear to be joined to the main which lay north of it; and being now come to the other &s;ide of what we &s;uppo&s;ed to be water, a bay, or low land, it had the &s;ame appearance, but when I came to lay it down upon paper I &s;aw no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e it to be an i&s;land; on the contrary, I was clearly of opinion that it made part of the main. At noon, the we&s;tern extremity of the main bore N. 59 W. and the i&s;land which we had &s;een in the morning, S. 59 W. di&s;tant about five leagues. It lies in latitude 46&deg; 31&prime; S. longitude 192&deg; 49&prime; W. and is nothing but a barren rock about a mile in circuit, re|markably high, and lies full five leagues di&s;tant from the main. This i&s;land I named after Dr. Solander, and called it SOLANDER's ISLAND. The &s;hore of the main lies neare&s;t E. by S. and W. by N. and forms a large open bay, in which there is no appearance of any harbour or &s;helter for &s;hipping again&s;t S. W. and &s;outherly winds: the &s;urface of the coun|try is broken into craggy hills, of a great height, on the &s;ummits of which are &s;everal patches of &s;now: it is not, however, wholly barren, for we could &s;ee wood not only in the vallies, but upon the highe&s;t ground, yet we &s;aw no ap|pearance of its being inhabited.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;tand to the S. W. by S. till eleven o'clock the next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 12.</NOTE> when the wind &s;hifted to the S. W. by W.
<PB N="424" REF="19">

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 13.</NOTE>During the night, we &s;teered N. N. W. till &s;ix in the morn|ing, when, &s;eeing no land, we &s;teered N. by E. till eight, when we &s;teered N. E. by E. &frac12; E. to make the land, which at ten we &s;aw bearing E. N. E. but it being hazy, we could di&s;|tingui&s;h nothing upon it. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;er|vation, was 46&deg; S. About two it cleared up, and the land appeared to be high, rude, and mountainous: about half an hour after three I hauled in for a bay, in which there ap|peared to be good anchorage; but in about an hour, finding the di&s;tance too great to run before it would be dark, and the wind blowing too hard to make the attempt &s;afe in the night, I bore away along the &s;hore.</P>
<P>This bay, which I called DUSKY BAY, lies in latitude 45&deg; 47&prime; S.: it is between three and four miles broad at the en|trance, and &s;eems to be full as deep as it is broad: it con|tains &s;everal i&s;lands, behind which there mu&s;t be &s;helter from all winds, though po&s;&s;ibly there may not be &s;ufficient depth of water. The north point of this bay, when it bears S. E. by S. is rendered very remarkable by five high peaked rocks which lie off it, and have the appearance of the four fingers and thumb of a man's hand, for which rea&s;on I called it POINT FIVE FINGERS: the land of this Point is far|ther remarkable, for being the only level land within a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance. It extends near two leagues to the north|ward, is lofty, and covered with wood: the land behind it is very different, con&s;i&s;ting wholly of mountains, totally barren and rocky; and this difference gives the Cape the ap|pearance of an i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="20">At &s;un-&s;et, the &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore due &s;outh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.

It lies about three leagues to the &s;outhward of Du&s;ky Bay, in the latitude of 45&deg; 54&prime; S. and in the longitude of 193&deg; 17&prime; W. The land of this Cape is of a moderate height next the &s;ea, and has nothing remarkable about it, except a very white cliff, two or three leagues to the &s;outhward of it: to the &s;outhward of it al&s;o the land trends away to the S. E. and to the northward it trends N. N. E.</P>
<P>Having brought to for the night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 14.</NOTE> we made &s;ail along the &s;hore at four in the morning, in the direction of N. E. &frac12; N. with a moderate breeze at S. S. E. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 45&deg; 13&prime; S. At this time, being about a league and an half from the &s;hore, we &s;ounded, but had no ground with &s;eventy fathom: we had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall nar|row opening in land, where there &s;eemed to be a very &s;afe and convenient harbour, formed by an i&s;land, which lay in the middle of the opening at ea&s;t. The opening lies in lati|tude 45&deg; 16&prime; S. and on the land behind it are mountains, the &s;ummits of which were covered with &s;now, that appeared to have been recently fallen; and indeed for two days pa&s;t we had found the weather very cold. On each &s;ide the entrance of the opening, the land ri&s;es almo&s;t perpendicularly from the &s;ea to a &s;tupendous height, and this indeed was the rea|&s;on why I did not carry the &s;hip into it, for no wind could blow there but right in, or right out, in the direction of either ea&s;t or we&s;t, and I thought it by no means advi&s;able to put into a place whence I could not have got out but with a wind which experience had taught me did not blow more than one day in a month. In this, however, I acted con|trary to the opinion of &s;ome per&s;ons on board, who in very
<PB N="426" REF="21">
&s;trong terms expre&s;&s;ed their de&s;ire to harbour for pre&s;ent con|venience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March. Wedne&s;. 14.</NOTE> without any regard to future di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>In the evening, being about two leagues from the &s;hore, we &s;ounded, and had no ground with 108 fathom: the va|riation of the needle, by azimuth, was 14&deg; E. and by ampli|tude 15&deg; 2&prime;. We made the be&s;t of our way along the &s;hore with what wind we had, keeping at the di&s;tance of between two and three leagues.

About two, we pa&s;t the point which at noon had been di&s;tant ten miles, and found it to con&s;i&s;t of high red cliffs, down which there fell a ca&s;cade of water in four &s;mall &s;treams, and I therefore gave it the name of CASCADE POINT. From this Point the land trends fir&s;t N. 76 E. and afterwards more to the north|ward. At the di&s;tance of eight leagues from Ca&s;cade Point, in the direction of E.N.E. and at a little di&s;tance from the &s;hore, lies a &s;mall low i&s;land, which bore from us S. by E. at the di&s;tance of about a league and a half.</P>

<P>In the afternoon, we had a gentle breeze from the S.S.W. with which we &s;teered north along the &s;hore till eight, when, being within between two and three leagues, we &s;ounded, and had but thirty-four fathom; upon which we hauled off N.W. by N. till eleven at night, and then brought to, having &s;ixty-four fathom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 22.</NOTE> At four in the morning, we made &s;ail to the N.E. with a light breeze at S.S.W. which at eight veered to the we&s;tward, and &s;oon after died away: at this time we were within three or four miles of the land, and had fifty-four fathom, with a large &s;well from the W.S.W. rolling obliquely upon the &s;hore, which made me fear that I &s;hould be obliged to anchor; but by the help of a light air now and then from the S.W.

Our latitude was now 40&deg; 55&prime; S. and having nearly run down the whole of the north we&s;t coa&s;t of Tovy Poenammoo, I &s;hall give &s;ome account of the face of the country.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that on the 11th, when we were off the &s;outhern part, the land then &s;een was craggy and mountainous, and there is great rea&s;on to believe that the &s;ame ridge of mountains extends nearly the whole length of the i&s;land. Between the we&s;termo&s;t land which we &s;aw that day, and the ea&s;termo&s;t which we &s;aw on the 13th, there is a &s;pace of about &s;ix or eight leagues, of which we did not &s;ee the coa&s;t, though we plainly di&s;covered the mountains in|land. The &s;ea coa&s;t near Cape We&s;t is low, ri&s;ing with an ea&s;y and gradual a&s;cent to the foot of the mountains, and being in mo&s;t parts covered with wood. From Point Five Fingers, down to latitude 44&deg; 20&prime; there is a narrow ridge of hills that ri&s;es directly from the &s;ea, and is covered with wood: clo&s;e behind the&s;e hills are the mountains, extending in another ridge of a &s;tupendous height, and con&s;i&s;ting of rocks that are totally barren and naked, except where they are covered with &s;now, which is to be &s;een in large patches upon many parts of them, and has probably lain there ever &s;ince the creation of the world: a pro&s;pect more rude, craggy, and de&s;olate than this country affords from the &s;ea, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be conceived, for as far inland as the eye can reach, nothing appears but the &s;ummits of rocks, which &s;tand &s;o near together, that in&s;tead of vallies there is only fi&s;&s;ures between them. From the latitude of 44&deg; 20&prime;, to the latitude of 42&deg; 8&prime;, the&s;e mountains lie farther inland, and
<PB N="430" REF="25">
the &s;ea coa&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of woody hills and vallies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.

From latitude 42&deg; 8&prime;, to 41&deg; 30&prime;, the land is not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any thing remarkable: it ri&s;es into hills directly from the &s;ea, and is covered with wood; but the weather being foggy while we were upon this part of the coa&s;t, we could &s;ee very little inland, except now and then the &s;ummits of the mountains, towering above the cloudy mi&s;ts that ob&s;cured them below, which confirmed my opinion that a chain of mountains extended from one end of the i&s;land to the other.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, we had a gentle breeze at S.W. which, before it was quite dark, brought us abrea&s;t of the ea&s;tern point which we had &s;een at noon; but not knowing what cour&s;e the land took on the other &s;ide of it, we brought to in thirty-four fathom, at the di&s;tance of about one league from the &s;hore. At eight in the evening, there being little wind, we filled and &s;tood on till midnight, and then we brought to till four in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 24.</NOTE> when we again made &s;ail, and at break of day we &s;aw low land extending from the point to the S.S.E. as far as the eye could reach, the ea&s;tern extre|mity of which appeared in round hillocks: by this time the gale had veered to the ea&s;tward, which obliged us to ply to windward.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 25.</NOTE> At noon next day, the ea&s;tern point bore S.W. by S. di&s;tant &s;ixteen miles, and our latitude was 40&deg; 19&prime;: the wind continuing ea&s;terly, we were nearly in the &s;ame &s;itu|ation at noon on the day following.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 26.</NOTE> About three o'clock the wind came to the we&s;tward, and we &s;teered E.S.E. with all the &s;ail we could &s;et till it was dark, and then &s;hortened &s;ail till the morning:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 27.</NOTE> as we had thick hazey weather all night,
<PB N="431" REF="26">
we kept &s;ounding continually,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March. Tue&s;day 27.</NOTE> and had from thirty-&s;even to forty-two fathom. When the day broke we &s;aw land bearing S.E. by E. and an i&s;land lying near it, bearing E.S.E. di&s;tant about five leagues: this i&s;land I knew to be the &s;ame that I had &s;een from the entrance of Queen Charlotte's Sound, from which it bears N.W. by N. di&s;tant nine leagues. At noon, it bore &s;outh, di&s;tant four or five miles, and the north we&s;t head of the Sound S.E. by S. di&s;tant ten leagues and an half. Our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 40&deg; 33&prime; S.</P>
<P>As we had now circumnavigated the whole country, it be|came nece&s;&s;ary to think of quitting it, but as I had thirty tons of empty water ca&s;ks on board, this could not be done till I had filled them: I therefore hauled round the i&s;land, and entered a bay, which lies between that and Queen Char|lotte's Sound, leaving three more i&s;lands, which lay clo&s;e under the we&s;tern &s;hore, between three or four miles within the entrance, on our &s;tarboard hand: while we were run|ning in, we kept the lead continually going, and had from forty to twelve fathom. At &s;ix o'clock in the evening, we anchored in eleven fathom with a muddy bottom, under the we&s;t &s;hore, in the &s;econd cove, that lies within the three i&s;lands; and as &s;oon as it was light the next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 28.</NOTE> I took a boat, and went on &s;hore to look for a watering-place, and a proper birth for the &s;hip, both which I found, much to my &s;atisfaction. As &s;oon as the &s;hip was moored, I &s;ent an offi|cer on &s;hore to &s;uperintend the watering, and the carpenter, with his crew, to cut wood, while the long-boat was em|ployed in landing the empty ca&s;ks.</P>
<P>In this employment we were bu&s;y till the 30th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 30.</NOTE> when the wind &s;eeming to &s;ettle at S.E. and our water being nearly completed, we warped the &s;hip out of the cove, that we might have room to get under &s;ail: and at noon I went away
<PB N="432" REF="27">
in the pinnace to examine as much of the bay as my time would admit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March. Friday 30.</NOTE></P>
<P>After rowing about two leagues up it, I went a&s;hore upon a point of land on the we&s;tern &s;ide, and having climbed a hill, I &s;aw the we&s;tern arm of this bay run in S.W. by W. about five leagues farther, yet I could not di&s;cover the end of it: there appeared to be &s;everal other inlets, or at lea&s;t &s;mall bays, between this and the north we&s;t head of Queen Char|lotte's Sound, in each of which, I make no doubt, there is anchorage and &s;helter, as they are all covered from the &s;ea wind by the i&s;lands which lie without them. The land about this bay, as far as I could &s;ee of it, is of a hilly &s;ur|face, chiefly covered with trees, &s;hrubs, and fern, which render travelling difficult and fatiguing. In this excur&s;ion I was accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who found &s;everal new plants. We met with &s;ome hutts, which &s;eemed to have been long de&s;erted, but &s;aw no inhabitants. Mr. Banks examined &s;everal of the &s;tones that lay upon the beach, which were full of veins, and had a mineral appear|ance; but he did not di&s;cover any thing in them which he knew to be ore: if he had had an opportunity to examine any of the bare rocks, perhaps he might have been more fortunate. He was al&s;o of opinion that what I had taken for marble in another place, was a mineral &s;ub&s;tance; and that, con&s;idering the corre&s;pondence of latitude between this place and South America, it was not improbable but that, by a proper examination, &s;omething very valuable might be found.</P>
<P>At my return in the evening, I found all the wood and water on board, and the &s;hip ready for the &s;ea; I re&s;olved therefore to quit the country, and return home by &s;uch a route as might be of mo&s;t advantage to the &s;ervice; and
<PB N="433" REF="28">
upon this &s;ubject took the opinion of my officers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March. Friday 30.</NOTE> I had my&s;elf a &s;trong de&s;ire to return by Cape Horn, becau&s;e that would have enabled me finally to determine, whether there is or is not a &s;outhern continent; but again&s;t this it was a &s;ufficient objection that we mu&s;t have kept in a high &s;outh|ern latitude in the very depth of winter, with a ve&s;&s;el which was not thought &s;ufficient for the undertaking: and the &s;ame rea&s;on was urged again&s;t our proceeding directly for the Cape of Good Hope, with &s;till more force, becau&s;e no di&s;covery of moment could be hoped for in that rout; it was therefore re&s;olved that we &s;hould return by the Ea&s;t Indies, and that with this view we &s;hould, upon leaving the coa&s;t, &s;teer we&s;tward, till we &s;hould fall in with the ea&s;t coa&s;t of New Holland, and then follow the direction of that coa&s;t to the northward, till we &s;hould arrive at its northern extre|mity; but if that &s;hould be found impracticable, it was fur|ther re&s;olved that we &s;hould endeavour to fall in with the land, or i&s;lands, &s;aid to have been di&s;covered by Quiros.</P>
<P>With this view,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 31.</NOTE> at break of day on Saturday the 31&s;t of March 1770, we got under &s;ail, and put to &s;ea, with the ad|vantage of a fre&s;h gale at S. E. and clear weather, taking our departure from the ea&s;tern point, which we had &s;een at noon on the 23d, and to which, on this occa&s;ion, I gave the name of CAPE FAREWELL.</P>
<P>The bay out of which we had ju&s;t &s;ailed I called ADMIRALTY BAY, giving the name of CAPE STEPHENS to the north we&s;t point, and of CAPE JACKSON to the &s;outh ea&s;t, after the two gentlemen who at this time were Secretaries to the Board.</P>
<P>Admiralty Bay may ea&s;ily be known by the i&s;land that has been ju&s;t mentioned, which lies two miles N. E. of Cape Ste|phens, in latitude 40&deg; 37&prime; S. longitude 185&deg; 6&prime; W. and is of a con&s;iderable height. Between this i&s;land and Cape Farewell,

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> A general Account of New Zealand: its fir&s;t Di&s;covery, Situation, Extent, Climate, and Productions.</HEAD>
<P>NEW ZEALAND was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Abel Jan&s;en Ta&s;man, a Dutch navigator,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> who&s;e name has been &s;everal times mentioned in this narrative, on the 13th of December, in the year 1642. He traver&s;ed the ea&s;tern coa&s;t from latitude 34&deg; to 43, and entered the &s;treight which di|vides the two i&s;lands, and in the chart is called COOK's STREIGHT; but being attacked by the natives &s;oon after he came to an anchor, in the place to which he gave the name of Murderer's Bay, he never went on &s;hore. He gave the country the name of STAATEN LAND, or the land of the States, in honour of the States-General, and it is now generally di&s;tingui&s;hed in our maps and charts by the name of NEW ZEALAND. As the whole of this country, except that part of the coa&s;t which was &s;een by Ta&s;man from on board his &s;hip, has from his time, to the voyage of the Endeavour, remained altogether unknown, it has by many been &s;uppo&s;ed to be part of a &s;outhern continent. It is however now known to con&s;i&s;t of two large i&s;lands, divided from each other by a &s;treight or pa&s;&s;age, which is about four or five leagues broad.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands are &s;ituated between the latitudes of 34&deg; and 48&deg; S. and between the longitudes of 181&deg; and 194&deg; W. which is now determined with uncommon exactne&s;s, from innu|merable ob&s;ervations of the &s;un and moon, and one of the

tran&s;its of Mercury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> by Mr. Green, a per&s;on of known abi|lities, who, as has been ob&s;erved before, was &s;ent out by the Royal Society, to ob&s;erve the tran&s;it of Venus in the South Seas.</P>
<P>The northermo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands is called by the natives Eaheinomauwe, and the &s;outhermo&s;t Tovy, or Tavai Poe|nammoo; yet, as I have ob&s;erved before, we are not &s;ure whether the name Tovy Poenammoo comprehends the whole &s;outhern i&s;land, or only part of it. The figure and extent of the&s;e i&s;lands, with the &s;ituation of the bays and harbours they contain, and the &s;maller i&s;lands that lie about them, will appear from the chart that I have drawn, every part of which, however, I cannot vouch to be equally accu|rate. The coa&s;t of Eaheinomauwe, from Cape Palli&s;er to Ea&s;t Cape, is laid down with great exactne&s;s, both in its figure, and the cour&s;e and di&s;tance from point to point; for the opportunities that offered, and the methods that I u&s;ed, were &s;uch as could &s;carcely admit of an error. From Ea&s;t Cape to St. Maria van Diemen, the chart, though perhaps not equally exact, is without any error of moment, except po&s;&s;ibly in &s;ome few places which are here, and in other parts of the chart, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a dotted line, and which I had no opportunity to examine: from Cape Maria van Di|emen to latitude 36&deg; 15&prime;, we were &s;eldom nearer the &s;hore than between five and eight leagues; and therefore the line that marks the &s;ea coa&s;t may po&s;&s;ibly be erroneous. From latitude 36&deg; 15&prime; to nearly the length of Entry I&s;land, our cour&s;e was very near the &s;hore, and in this part of the chart therefore there can be no material error, except perhaps at Cape Tierawitte. Between Entry I&s;land and Cape Palli&s;er we were again farther from the &s;hore, and this part of the coa&s;t therefore may not be laid down with minute exactne&s;s; yet, upon the whole, I am of opinion that this i&s;land will be
<PB N="437" REF="32">
found not much to differ from the figure that I have given it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> and that upon the coa&s;t there are few or no harbours which are not noticed in the journal, or delineated in the chart. I cannot however &s;ay as much of Tovy Poenammoo, the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and the circum&s;tances of the voyage, would not permit me to &s;pend &s;o much time about this i&s;land as I had employed upon the other; and the &s;torms that we met with made it both difficult and dangerous to keep near the &s;hore. However, from Queen Charlotte's Sound to Cape Campbel, and as far to the S.W. as latitude 43&deg;, the chart will be found pretty accurate. Between lati|tude 43&deg; and latitude 44&deg; 20&prime; the line may be doubted, for of &s;ome part of the coa&s;t which it repre&s;ents, we had &s;carcely a view. From latitude 44&deg; 20&prime;, to Cape Saunders, our di&s;tance would not permit me to be particular, and the weather was be&s;ides extremely unfavourable. From Cape Saunders to Cape South, and even to Cape We&s;t, there is al&s;o rea&s;on to fear that the chart will in many places be found erroneous, as we were &s;eldom able to keep the &s;hore, and were &s;ome|times blown to &s;uch a di&s;tance that it could not be &s;een. From Cape We&s;t to Cape Farewell, and even to Charlotte's Sound, it is not more to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>Tovy Poenammoo is for the mo&s;t part a mountainous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Country.</NOTE> and to all appearance a barren country; and the people whom we &s;aw in Queen Charlotte's Sound, tho&s;e that came off to us under the &s;nowy mountains, and the fires to the we&s;t of Cape Saunders, were all the inhabitants, and &s;igns of in|habitants, that we di&s;covered upon the whole i&s;land.</P>
<P>Eaheinomauwe has a much better appearance; it is indeed not only hilly but mountainous, yet even the hills and moun|tains are covered with wood, and every valley has a rivulet
<PB N="438" REF="33">
of water:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> the &s;oil in the&s;e vallies, and in the plains, of which there are many that are not overgrown with wood, is in general light but fertile, and in the opinion of Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, as well as of every other gentleman on board, every kind of European grain, plants, and fruit, would flouri&s;h here in the utmo&s;t luxuriance: from the ve|getables that we found here, there is rea&s;on to conclude, that the winters are milder than tho&s;e in England, and we found the &s;ummer not hotter, though it was more equally warm; &s;o that if this country &s;hould be &s;ettled by people from Europe, they would, with a little indu&s;try, be very &s;oon &s;upplied not only with the nece&s;&s;aries, but the luxuries of life in great abundance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quadrupeds.</NOTE>In this country there are no quadrupeds but dogs and rats, at lea&s;t we &s;aw no other, and the rats are &s;o &s;carce that many of us never &s;aw them. The dogs live with the people, who breed them for no other purpo&s;e than to eat: there might indeed be quadrupeds that we did not &s;ee, but this is not probable, becau&s;e the chief pride of the natives, with re&s;pect to their dre&s;s, is in the &s;kins and hair of &s;uch animals as they have, and we never &s;aw the &s;kin of any animal about them but tho&s;e of dogs and birds: there are indeed &s;eals upon the coa&s;t, and we once &s;aw a &s;ea lion, but we imagine they are &s;eldom caught, for though we &s;aw &s;ome of their teeth which were fa&s;hioned into an ornament like a bodkin, and worn by the natives at their brea&s;t, and highly valued, we &s;aw none of their &s;kins: there are whales al&s;o upon this coa&s;t, and though the people did not appear to have any art or in&s;trument by which &s;uch an animal could be taken and killed, we &s;aw pattoo-pattoos in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of them, which were made of the bone of a whale, or of &s;ome other animal who&s;e bone had exactly the &s;ame appearance.</P>

Birds.</NOTE> except perhaps the gannet, is the &s;ame with tho&s;e of Eu|rope: here are ducks indeed, and &s;hags of &s;everal kinds, &s;ufficiently re&s;embling tho&s;e of Europe, to be called the &s;ame, by tho&s;e who have not examined them very nicely. Here are al&s;o hawks, owls, and quails, which differ but little from tho&s;e of Europe at fir&s;t &s;ight; and &s;everal &s;mall birds, who&s;e &s;ong, as has been remarked in the cour&s;e of the narrative, is much more melodious than any that we had ever heard.</P>
<P>The &s;ea coa&s;t is al&s;o vi&s;ited by many oceanic birds, parti|cularly albatro&s;&s;es, &s;heerwaters, pintados, and a few of the birds which Sir John Narborough has called Penguins, and which indeed are what the French call <HI>Nuance,</HI> and &s;eem to be a middle &s;pecies between bird and fi&s;h; for their fea|thers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e upon their wings, differ very little from &s;cales; and their wings them&s;elves, which they u&s;e only in diving, and not to accelerate their motion even upon the &s;urface of the water, may, perhaps with equal propriety, be called fins.</P>
<P>Neither are in&s;ects in greater plenty than birds: a few butterflies and beetles, fle&s;h flies, very like tho&s;e in Europe, and &s;ome mu&s;quitos and &s;and flies, perhaps exactly the &s;ame with tho&s;e of North America, make up the whole catalogue. Of mu&s;quitos and &s;and flies, however, which are ju&s;tly ac|counted the cur&s;e of every country where they abound, we did not &s;ee many; there were indeed a few in almo&s;t every place where we went on &s;hore, but they gave us &s;o little trouble, that we did not make u&s;e of the &s;hades which we had provided for the &s;ecurity of our faces.</P>

Of this article, the variety was equal to the plenty; we had mackrel of many kinds, among which, one was exactly the &s;ame as we have in England: the&s;e came in immen&s;e &s;hoals, and were taken by the natives in their &s;eines, who &s;old them to us at a very ea&s;y rate. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there were fi&s;h of many &s;pecies which we had never &s;een before, but to all which the &s;eamen very readily gave names; &s;o that we talked here as familiarly of hakes, bream, cole-fi&s;h, and many others, as we do in Eng|land; and though they are by no means of the &s;ame family, at mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that they do honour to the name. But the highe&s;t luxury which the &s;ea afforded us, even in this place, was the lob&s;ter or &s;ea cray-fi&s;h, which are probably the &s;ame that in the Account of Lord An&s;on's Voyage are &s;aid to have been found at the i&s;land of Juan Fernandes, except that, although large, they are not quite equal in &s;ize: they differ from ours in England in &s;everal particulars, they have a greater number of prickles on their backs, and they are red when fir&s;t taken out of the water. The&s;e we al&s;o bought every where to the northward in great quantities of the na|tives, who catch them by diving near the &s;hore, and finding out where they lie with their feet. We had al&s;o a fi&s;h that Frezier, in his Voyage to the Spani&s;h Main in South Ame|rica,

Seve|ral &s;pecies of the &s;kate, or &s;ting-ray, are al&s;o found here, which were &s;till coar&s;er than the Elefant; but as an atone|ment, we had among many kinds of dog-fi&s;h one, &s;potted with white, which was in flavour exactly &s;imilar to our be&s;t &s;kate, but much more delicious. We had al&s;o flat fi&s;h re|&s;embling both &s;oles and flounders, be&s;ides eels and congers of various kinds, with many others of which tho&s;e who &s;hall hereafter vi&s;it this coa&s;t will not fail to find the advan|tage; and &s;hell-fi&s;h in great variety, particularly clams, cockles, and oy&s;ters.</P>
<P>Among the vegetable productions of this country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees, plants, &amp;c.</NOTE> the trees claim a principal place; for here are fore&s;ts of va&s;t ex|tent, full of the &s;traite&s;t, the cleane&s;t, and the large&s;t timber trees that we had ever &s;een; their &s;ize, their grain, and ap|parent durability, render them fit for any kind of building, and indeed for every other purpo&s;e except ma&s;ts; for which, as I have already ob&s;erved, they are too hard, and too hea|vy: there is one in particular which, when we were upon the coa&s;t, was rendered con&s;picuous by a &s;carlet flower, that &s;eemed to be a compendage of many fibres; it is about as large as an oak, and the wood is exceedingly hard and hea|vy, and excellently adapted to the u&s;e of the mill-wright. There is another which grows in the &s;wamps, remarkably tall and &s;trait, thick enough to make ma&s;ts for ve&s;&s;els of any &s;ize, and, if a judgment may be formed by the direction of its grain, very tough: this, which, as has been before re|marked, our carpenter thought to re&s;emble the pitch-pine, may probably be lightened by tapping, and it will then make the fine&s;t ma&s;ts in the world: it has a leaf not unlike a yew, and bears berries in &s;mall bunches.</P>

<P>Of eatable vegetables there are but few; our people, in|deed, who had been long at &s;ea, eat, with equal plea&s;ure and advantage, of wild celery, and a kind of cre&s;&s;es, which grew in great abundance upon all parts of the &s;ea-&s;hore. We al&s;o, once or twice, met with a plant like what the country people in England call <HI>Lamb's quarters,</HI> or Fat-hen, which we boiled in&s;tead of greens; and once we had the good fortune to find a cabbage tree, which afforded us a delicious meal; and, except the fern-root, and one other vegetable, totally unknown in Europe, and which, though eaten by the na|tives, was extremely di&s;agreeable to us, we found no other vegetable production that was fit for food, among tho&s;e that appeared to be the wild produce of the country; and we could find but three e&s;culent plants among tho&s;e which are rai&s;ed by cultivation, yams, &s;weet potatoes, and coccos.

We al&s;o found here the Chine&s;e paper mulberry tree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> the &s;ame as that of which the inhabitants of the South Sea i&s;lands make their cloth; but it is &s;o &s;carce, that though the New Zealanders al&s;o make cloth of it, they have not enough for any other purpo&s;e than to wear as an ornament in the holes which they make in their ears, as I have ob&s;erved before.</P>
<P>But among all the trees, &s;hrubs, and plants of this coun|try, there is not one that produces fruit, except a berry which has neither &s;weetne&s;s nor flavour, and which none but the boys took pains to gather, &s;hould be honoured with that appellation. There is, however, a plant that &s;erves the inhabitants in&s;tead of hemp and flax, which excels all that are put to the &s;ame purpo&s;es in other countries. Of this plant there are two &s;orts; the leaves of both re&s;emble tho&s;e of flags, but the flowers are &s;maller, and their clu&s;ters more numerous; in one kind they are yellow, and in the other a deep red. Of the leaves of the&s;e plants, with very little pre|paration, they make all their common apparel; and of the&s;e they make al&s;o their &s;trings, lines, and cordage for every pur|po&s;e, which are &s;o much &s;tronger than any thing we can make with hemp, that they will not bear a compari&s;on. From the &s;ame plant, by another preparation, they draw long &s;lender fibres which &s;hine like &s;ilk, and are as white as &s;now: of the&s;e, which are al&s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly &s;trong, the finer clothes are made; and of the leaves, without any other preparation than &s;plitting them into proper breadths, and tying the &s;trips together, they make their fi&s;hing nets; &s;ome of which, as I have before remarked, are of an enormous &s;ize.</P>
<P>A plant, which with &s;uch advantage might be applied to &s;o many u&s;eful and important purpo&s;es, would certainly be
<PB N="444" REF="39">
a great acqui&s;ition to England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> where it would probably thrive with very little trouble, as it &s;eems to be hardy, and to affect no particular &s;oil; being found equally in hill and valley; in the drie&s;t mould, and the deepe&s;t bogs: the bog, however, it &s;eems rather to prefer, as near &s;uch places we ob&s;erved it to be larger than el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that we found great plenty of iron &s;and in Mercury Bay, and therefore that iron ore is undoubtedly to be found at no great di&s;tance. As to other metals we had &s;carcely knowlege enough of the country for conjecture.</P>
<P>If the &s;ettling of this country &s;hould ever be thought an object worthy the attention of Great Britain, the be&s;t place for e&s;tabli&s;hing a colony would be either on the banks of the Thames, or in the country bordering upon the Bay of I&s;lands. In either place there would be the advantage of an excellent harbour; and, by means of the river, &s;ettlements might be extended, and a communication e&s;tabli&s;hed with the inland parts of the country: ve&s;&s;els might be built of the fine timber which abounds in the&s;e parts, at very little trouble and expence, fit for &s;uch a navigation as would an|&s;wer the purpo&s;e. I cannot indeed exactly a&s;&s;ign the depth of water which a ve&s;&s;el intended to navigate this river, even as far up as I went with the boat, &s;hould draw, becau&s;e this depends upon the depth of water that is upon the bar, or flats, which lie before the narrow part of the river, for I had no opportunity to make my&s;elf acquainted with them; but I am of opinion, that a ve&s;&s;el which &s;hould draw not more than twelve feet would perfectly an&s;wer the purpo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> A De&s;cription of the Inhabitants, their Habitations, Ap|parel, Ornaments, Food, Cookery, and Manner of Life.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE>THE &s;tature of the men in general is equal to the large&s;t of tho&s;e in Europe: they are &s;tout, well limbed, and fle&s;hy; but not fat, like the lazy and luxurious inhabitants of the i&s;lands in the South Seas: they are al&s;o exceedingly vigorous and active; and have an adroitne&s;s, and manual dexterity in an uncommon degree, which are di&s;covered in whatever they do. I have &s;een the &s;trokes of fifteen paddles on a &s;ide in one of their canoes made with incredible quick|ne&s;s, and yet with &s;uch minute exactne&s;s of time, that all the rowers &s;eemed to be actuated by one common &s;oul. Their colour in general is brown; but in few deeper than that of a Spaniard, who has been expo&s;ed to the &s;un; in many not &s;o deep. The women have not a feminine delicacy in their appearance, but their voice is remarkably &s;oft; and by that, the dre&s;s of both &s;exes being the &s;ame, they are prin|cipally di&s;tingui&s;hed: they have, however, like the women of other countries, more airy cheerfulne&s;s, and a greater flow of animal &s;pirits, than the other &s;ex. Their hair, both of the head and beard, is black; and their teeth extremely regular, and as white as ivory: the features of both &s;exes are good; they &s;eem to enjoy high health, and we &s;aw many who ap|peared to be of a great age. The di&s;po&s;itions both of the men and women &s;eemed to be mild and gentle; they treat
<PB N="447" REF="42">
each other with the tendere&s;t affection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> but are implacable towards their enemies, to whom, as I have before ob&s;erved, they never give quarter. It may perhaps, at fir&s;t, &s;eem &s;trange, that where there is &s;o little to be got by victory, there &s;hould &s;o often be war; and that every little di&s;trict of a country inhabited by people &s;o mild and placid, &s;hould be at enmity with all the re&s;t. But po&s;&s;ibly more is to be gained by victory among the&s;e people than at fir&s;t appears, and they may be prompted to mutual ho&s;tilities by motives which no degree of friend&s;hip or affection is able to re&s;i&s;t. It appears, by the account that has already been given of them, that their principal food is fi&s;h, which can only be procured upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t; and there, in &s;ufficient quantities, only at cer|tain times: the tribes, therefore, who live inland, if any &s;uch there are, and even tho&s;e upon the coa&s;t, mu&s;t be fre|quently in danger of peri&s;hing by famine. Their country produces neither &s;heep, nor goats, nor hogs, nor cattle; tame fowls they have none, nor any art by which tho&s;e that are wild can be caught in &s;ufficient plenty to &s;erve as provi&s;ion. If there are any who&s;e &s;ituation cuts them off from a &s;upply of fi&s;h, the only &s;uccedaneum of all other animal food, ex|cept dogs, they have nothing to &s;upport life, but the vegetables that have already been mentioned, of which the chief are fern root, yams, clams, and potatoes: when by any accident the&s;e fail, the di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t be dreadful; and even among the inha|bitants of the coa&s;t, many tribes mu&s;t frequently be reduced to nearly the &s;ame &s;ituation, either by the failure of their plantations, or the deficiency of their dry &s;tock, during the &s;ea&s;on when but few fi&s;h are to be caught. The&s;e con&s;ide|rations will enable us to account, not only for the perpetual danger in which the people who inhabit this country appear to live, by the care which they take to fortify every village, but for the horrid practice of eating tho&s;e who are killed in
<PB N="448" REF="43">
battle;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> for the hunger of him who is pre&s;&s;ed by famine to fight, will ab&s;orb every feeling, and every &s;entiment which would re&s;train him from allaying it with the body of his ad|ver&s;ary. It may however be remarked, that, if this account of the origin of &s;o horrid a practice is true, the mi&s;chief does by no means end with the nece&s;&s;ity that produced it: after the practice has been once begun on one &s;ide by hun|ger, it will naturally be adopted on the other by revenge. Nor is this all, for though it may be pretended, by &s;ome who wi&s;h to appear &s;peculative and philo&s;ophical, that whether the dead body of an enemy be eaten or buried, is in it&s;elf a a matter perfectly indifferent; as it is, whether the brea&s;ts and thighs of a woman &s;hould be covered or naked; and that prejudice and habit only make us &s;hudder at the viola|tion of cu&s;tom in one in&s;tance, and blu&s;h at it in the other: yet, leaving this as a point of doubtful di&s;putation, to be di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed at lei&s;ure, it may &s;afely be affirmed, that the practice of eating human fle&s;h, whatever it may be in it&s;elf, is rela|tively, and in its con&s;equences, mo&s;t pernicious; tending manife&s;tly to eradicate a principle which is the chief &s;ecu|rity of human life, and more frequently re&s;trains the hand of murder than the &s;en&s;e of duty, or even the fear of pu|ni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to eat the dead, death mu&s;t have lo&s;t much of its horror; and where there is little horror at the &s;ight of death, there will not be much repug|nance to kill. A &s;en&s;e of duty, and fear of puni&s;hment, may be more ea&s;ily &s;urmounted than the feelings of Nature, or tho&s;e which have been engrafted upon Nature by early pre|judice and uninterrupted cu&s;tom. The horror of the mur|derer ari&s;es le&s;s from the guilt of the fact, than its natural effect; and he who has familiari&s;ed the effect, will con&s;e|quently lo&s;e much of the horror. By our laws, and our re|ligion,
<PB N="449" REF="44">
murder and theft incur the &s;ame puni&s;hment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March</NOTE> both in this world and the next; yet, of the multitude who would deliberately &s;teal, there are but very few who would delibe|rately kill, even to procure much greater advantage. But there is the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to believe, that tho&s;e who have been &s;o accu&s;tomed to prepare a human body for a meal, that they can with as little feeling cut up a dead man, as our cook-maids divide a dead rabbit for a frica&s;&s;ee, would feel as little horror in committing a murder as in picking a pocket, and con&s;equently would take away life with as little compunction as property; &s;o that men, under the&s;e circum|&s;tances, would be made murderers by the &s;light temptations that now make them thieves. If any man doubts whether this rea&s;oning is conclu&s;ive, let him a&s;k him&s;elf, whether in his own opinion he &s;hould not be &s;afer with a man in whom the horror of de&s;troying life is &s;trong, whether in con&s;e|quence of natural in&s;tinct un&s;ubdued, or of early prejudice, which has nearly an equal influence; than in the power of a man who under any temptation to murder him would be re&s;trained only by con&s;iderations of intere&s;t; for to the&s;e all motives of mere duty may be reduced, as they mu&s;t termi|nate either in hope of good, or fear of evil.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, however, of the&s;e poor people, as well as their temper, are favourable to tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;ettle as a colony among them. Their &s;ituation &s;ets them in need of protection, and their temper renders it ea&s;y to attach them by kindne&s;s; and whatever may be &s;aid in favour of a &s;avage life, among people who live in luxurious idlene&s;s upon the bounty of Nature, civilization would cer|tainly be a ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e whom her par&s;imony &s;carcely furni&s;hes with the bread of life, and who are perpetually de&s;troying each other by violence, as the only alternative of peri&s;hing by hunger.</P>
<P><PB N="450" REF="45"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE>But the&s;e people, from whatever cau&s;e, being inured to war, and by habit con&s;idering every &s;tranger as an enemy, were always di&s;po&s;ed to attack us when they were not inti|midated by our manife&s;t &s;uperiority. At fir&s;t, they had no notion of any &s;uperiority but numbers; and when this was on their &s;ide, they con&s;idered all our expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s as the artifices of fear and cunning, to circumvent them, and pre&s;erve our&s;elves: but when they were once convinced of our power, after having provoked us to the u&s;e of our fire-arms, though loaded only with &s;mall &s;hot; and of our clemency, by our forbearing to make u&s;e of weapons &s;o dreadful except in our defence; they became at once friend|ly, and even affectionate, placing in us the mo&s;t unbounded confidence, and doing every thing which could incite us to put equal confidence in them. It is al&s;o remarkable, that when an intercour&s;e was once e&s;tabli&s;hed between us, they were very rarely detected in any act of di&s;hone&s;ty. Before, indeed, and while they con&s;idered us as enemies, who came upon their coa&s;t only to make an advantage of them, they did not &s;cruple by any means to make an advantage of us; and would, therefore, when they had received the price of any thing they had offered to &s;ell, pack up both the pur|cha&s;e and the purcha&s;e-money with all po&s;&s;ible compo&s;ure, as &s;o much lawful plunder from people who had no view but to plunder them.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved that our friends in the South Seas had not even the idea of indecency, with re&s;pect to any object or any action; but this was by no means the ca&s;e with the inhabi|tants of New Zealand, in who&s;e carriage and conver&s;ation there was as much mode&s;t re&s;erve and decorum with re&s;pect to actions, which yet in their opinion were not criminal, as are to be found among the polite&s;t people in Europe. The women were not impregnable; but the terms and manner
<PB N="451" REF="46">
of compliance were as decent as tho&s;e in marriage among us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> and according to their notions, the agreement was as inno|cent. When any of our people made an overture to one of their young women, he was given to under&s;tand that the con&s;ent of her friends was nece&s;&s;ary, and by the influence of a proper pre&s;ent, it was generally obtained; but when the&s;e preliminaries were &s;ettled, it was al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to treat the wife for a night, with the &s;ame delicacy that is here required by the wife for life, and the lover who pre&s;umed to take any liberties by which this was violated, was &s;ure to be di&s;ap|pointed.</P>
<P>One of our gentlemen having made his addre&s;&s;es to a fa|mily of the better &s;ort, received an an&s;wer, which, tran&s;lated into our language, according to the mode and &s;pirit of it, as well as the letter, would have been exactly in the&s;e terms: "Any of the&s;e young ladies will think them&s;elves honoured by your addre&s;&s;es, but you mu&s;t fir&s;t make me a &s;uitable pre|&s;ent, and you mu&s;t then come and &s;leep with us on &s;hore, for daylight mu&s;t by no means be a witne&s;s of what pa&s;&s;es be|tween you."</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that in per&s;onal cleanline&s;s they are not quite equal to our friends at Otaheite; becau&s;e, not having the advantage of &s;o warm a climate, they do not &s;o often go into the water; but the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tful thing about them is the oil, with which, like the I&s;landers, they anoint their hair: it is certainly the fat either of fi&s;h or of birds, melted down, and though the better &s;ort have it fre&s;h, their inferiors u&s;e that which is rancid, and con&s;equently are al|mo&s;t as di&s;agreeable to the &s;mell as a Hottentot; neither are their heads free from vermin, though we ob&s;erved that they were furni&s;hed with combs, both of bone and wood: the&s;e combs are &s;ometimes worn &s;tuck upright in the hair as an
<PB N="452" REF="47">
ornament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> a fa&s;hion which at pre&s;ent prevails among the ladies of England. The men generally wear their beards &s;hort, and their hair tied upon the crown of the head in a bunch, in which they &s;tick the feathers of various birds, in different manners, according to their fancies; &s;ometimes one is placed on each &s;ide of the temples, pointing forwards, which we thought made a very di&s;agreeable appearance. The women wear their hair &s;ometimes cropped &s;hort, and &s;ometimes flowing over their &s;houlders.</P>
<P>The bodies of both &s;exes are marked with the black &s;tains called Amoco, by the &s;ame method that is u&s;ed at Otaheite, and called Tattowing; but the men are more marked, and the women le&s;s. The women in general &s;tain no part of their bodies but the lips, though &s;ometimes they are marked with &s;mall black patches on other parts: the men, on the contrary, &s;eem to add &s;omething every year to the orna|ments of the la&s;t, &s;o that &s;ome of them, who appeared to be of an advanced age, were almo&s;t covered from head to foot. Be&s;ides the Amoco, they have marks impre&s;&s;ed by a method unknown to us, of a very extraordinary kind: they are fur|rows of about a line deep, and a line broad, &s;uch as appear upon the bark of a tree which has been cut through, after a year's growth: the edges of the&s;e furrows are afterwards in|dented by the &s;ame method, and being perfectly black, they make a mo&s;t frightful appearance. The faces of the old men are almo&s;t covered with the&s;e marks; tho&s;e who are very young, black only their lips like the women; when they are &s;omewhat older, they have generally a black patch upon one cheek, and over one eye, and &s;o proceed gra|dually, that they may grow old and honourable together: but though we could not but be di&s;gu&s;ted with the horrid deformity which the&s;e &s;tains and furrows produced in the "human face divine," we could not but admire the dexte|rity
<PB REF="48">

<PB N="453" REF="49">
and art with which they were impre&s;&s;ed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> The marks upon the face in general are &s;pirals, which are drawn with great nicety, and even elegance, tho&s;e on one &s;ide exactly corre|&s;ponding with tho&s;e on the other: the marks on the body &s;omewhat re&s;emble the foliage in old cha&s;ed ornaments, and the convolutions of fillagree work; but in the&s;e they have &s;uch a luxuriance of fancy, that of an hundred, which at fir&s;t &s;ight appeared to be exactly the &s;ame, no two were, upon a clo&s;e examination, found to be alike. We ob&s;erved, that the quantity and form of the&s;e marks were different in different parts of the coa&s;t, and that as the principal &s;eat of them at Otaheite was the breech, in New Zealand it was &s;ometimes the only part which was free, and in general was le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed than any other.</P>
<P>The &s;kins of the&s;e people, however, are not only dyed, but painted, for as I have before ob&s;erved, they &s;mear their bo|dies with red oker, &s;ome rubbing it on dry, and &s;ome apply|ing it in large patches mixed with oil, which is always wet, and which the lea&s;t touch will rub off, &s;o that the tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions of &s;uch of our people as were guilty of ravi&s;hing a ki&s;s from the&s;e blooming beauties, were mo&s;t legibly written upon their faces.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of a New Zealander is certainly, to a &s;tranger at fir&s;t &s;ight, the mo&s;t uncouth that can be imagined. It is made of the leaves of the flag, which has been de&s;cribed among the vegetable productions of this country: the&s;e leaves are &s;plit into three or four &s;lips, and the &s;lips, when they are dry, interwoven with each other into a kind of &s;tuff between netting and cloth, with all the ends, which are eight or nine inches long, hanging out on the upper &s;ide, like the &s;hag or thrumb matts, which we &s;ometimes &s;ee lying in a pa&s;&s;age. Of this cloth, if cloth it may be called,
<PB N="454" REF="50">
two pieces &s;erve for a complete dre&s;s;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> one of them is tied over their &s;houlders with a &s;tring, and reaches as low as the knees; to the end of this &s;tring is fa&s;tened a bodkin of bone, which is ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed through any two parts of this upper garment, &s;o as to tack them together; the other piece is wrapped round the wai&s;t, and reaches nearly to the ground: the lower garment, however, is worn by the men only upon particular occa&s;ions; but they wear a belt, to which a &s;tring is fa&s;tened, for a very &s;ingular u&s;e. The in|habitants of the South Sea i&s;lands &s;lit up the prepuce &s;o as to prevent it from covering the glans of the penis, but the&s;e people, on the contrary, bring the prepuce over the glans, and to prevent it from being drawn back by the contraction of the part, they tie the &s;tring which hangs from their girdle, round the end of it. The glans indeed &s;eemed to be the only part of their body which they were &s;olicitous to con|ceal, for they frequently threw off all their dre&s;s but the belt and &s;tring, with the mo&s;t carele&s;s indifference, but &s;hewed manife&s;t &s;igns of confu&s;ion, when, to gratify our curio&s;ity, they were reque&s;ted to untie the &s;tring, and never con&s;ented but with the utmo&s;t reluctance and &s;hame. When they have only their upper garment on, and &s;it upon their hams, they bear &s;ome re&s;emblance to a thatched hou&s;e; but this cover|ing, though it is ugly, is well adapted to the u&s;e of tho&s;e who frequently &s;leep in the open air, without any other &s;helter from the rain.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this cour&s;e &s;hag or thatch, they have two &s;orts of cloth, which have an even &s;urface, and are very ingeni|ou&s;ly made, in the &s;ame manner with that manufactured by the inhabitants of South America, &s;ome of which we procured at Rio de Janeiro. One &s;ort is as coar&s;e as our coar&s;e&s;t canvas, and &s;omewhat re&s;embles it in the manner of laying the threads, but it is ten times as &s;trong: the other is
<PB N="455" REF="51">
formed by many threads lying very clo&s;e one way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> and a few cro&s;&s;ing them the other, &s;o as to bind them together; but the&s;e are about half an inch a&s;under, &s;omewhat like the round pieces of cane matting which are &s;ometimes placed under the di&s;hes upon a table. This is frequently &s;triped, and always had a pretty appearance, for it is compo&s;ed of the fibres of the &s;ame plant, which are prepared &s;o as to &s;hine like &s;ilk. It is made in a kind of frame of the &s;ize of the cloth, generally about five feet long, and four broad, acro&s;s which the long threads, which lie clo&s;e together, or warp, are &s;trained, and the cro&s;s threads, or woof, are worked in by hand, which mu&s;t be a very tedious operation.</P>
<P>To both the&s;e kinds of cloth they work borders of different colours, in &s;titches, &s;omewhat like carpeting, or rather like tho&s;e u&s;ed in the &s;amplars which girls work at &s;chool. The&s;e borders are of various patterns, and wrought with a neat|ne&s;s, and even an elegance, which, con&s;idering they have no needle, is &s;urprizing: but the great pride of their dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the fur of their dogs, which they u&s;e with &s;uch oeconomy that they cut it into &s;tripes, and &s;ew them upon their cloth at a di&s;tance from each other, which is a &s;trong proof that dogs are not plenty among them; the&s;e &s;tripes are al&s;o of different colours, and di&s;po&s;ed &s;o as to produce a plea&s;ing effect. We &s;aw &s;ome dre&s;&s;es that were adorned with feathers in&s;tead of fur, but the&s;e were not common; and we &s;aw one that was intirely covered with the red feathers of the parrot.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the man who was killed, when we fir&s;t went a&s;hore in Poverty Bay, has been de&s;cribed already; but we &s;aw the &s;ame dre&s;s only once more during our &s;tay upon the coa&s;t, and that was in Queen Charlotte's Sound.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="52"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE>The women, contrary to the cu&s;tom of the &s;ex in general, &s;eemed to affect dre&s;s rather le&s;s than the men: their hair, which, as I have ob&s;erved before, is generally cropt &s;hort, is never tied upon the top of the head when it is &s;uffered to be long, nor is it ever adorned with feathers. Their garments were made of the &s;ame materials, and in the &s;ame form, as tho&s;e of the other &s;ex, but the lower one was always bound fa&s;t round them, except when they went into the water to catch lob&s;ters, and then they took great care not to be &s;een by the men. Some of us happening one day to land upon a &s;mall i&s;land in Tolaga Bay, we &s;urprized &s;everal of them at this employment; and the cha&s;te Diana, with her nymphs, could not have di&s;covered more confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s at the &s;ight of Actaeon, than the&s;e women expre&s;&s;ed upon our ap|proach. Some of them hid them&s;elves among the rocks, and the re&s;t crouched down in the &s;ea till they had made them&s;elves a girdle and apron of &s;uch weeds as they could find, and when they came out, even with this veil, we could perceive that their mode&s;ty &s;uffered much pain by our pre|&s;ence. The girdle and apron which they wear in common, have been mentioned before.</P>
<P>Both &s;exes bore their ears, and by &s;tretching them the holes become large enough to admit a finger at lea&s;t. In the&s;e holes they wear ornaments of various kinds, cloth, feathers, bones of large birds, and even &s;ometimes a &s;tick of wood; and to the&s;e receptacles of finery they generally ap|plied the nails which we gave them, and every thing which it was po&s;&s;ible they could contain. The women &s;ometimes thru&s;t through them the down of the albatro&s;s, which is as white as &s;now, and which, &s;preading before and behind the hole in a bunch almo&s;t as big as the fi&s;t, makes a very &s;in|gular, and however &s;trange it may be thought, not a di&s;|agreeable

appearance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> Be&s;ides the ornaments that are thru&s;t through the holes of the ears, many others are &s;u&s;pended to them by &s;trings; &s;uch as chi&s;&s;els or bodkins made of green talc, upon which they &s;et a high value, the nails and teeth of their decea&s;ed relations, the teeth of dogs, and every thing el&s;e that they can get, which they think either curious or valuable. The women al&s;o wear bracelets and anclets, made of the bones of birds, &s;hells, or any other &s;ub&s;tances which they can perforate and &s;tring upon a thread. The men had &s;ometimes hanging to a &s;tring, which went round the neck, a piece of green talc, or whalebone, &s;omewhat in the &s;hape of a tongue, with the rude figure of a man carved upon it; and upon this ornament they &s;et a high value. In one in&s;tance, we &s;aw the gri&s;tle that divides the no&s;trils, and called by anatomi&s;ts, the <HI>&s;eptum na&s;i,</HI> perforated, and a fea|ther thru&s;t through the whole, which projected on each &s;ide over the cheeks: it is probable that this frightful &s;ingularity was intended as an ornament, but of the many people we &s;aw, we never ob&s;erved it in any other, nor even a perfora|tion that might occa&s;ionally &s;erve for &s;uch a purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es are the mo&s;t inartificially made of any thing among them, being &s;carcely equal, except in &s;ize,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hou&s;es.</NOTE> to an Engli&s;h dog-kennel: they are &s;eldom more than eighteen or twenty feet long, eight or ten broad, and five or &s;ix high, from the pole that runs from one end to the other, and forms the ridge, to the ground: the framing is of wood, generally &s;lender &s;ticks, and both walls and roof con&s;i&s;t of dry gra&s;s and hay, which, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is very tightly put to|gether; and &s;ome are al&s;o lined with the bark of trees, &s;o that in cold weather they mu&s;t afford a very comfortable re|treat. The roof is &s;loping, like tho&s;e of our barns, and the door is at one end, ju&s;t high enough to admit a man, creep|ing upon his hands and knees: near the door is a &s;quare
<PB N="458" REF="54">
hole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> which &s;erves the double office of window and chim|ney, for the fire-place is at that end, nearly in the middle between the two &s;ides: in &s;ome con&s;picuous part, and gene|rally near the door, a plank is fixed, covered with carving after their manner: this they value as we do a picture, and in their e&s;timation it is not an inferior ornament: the &s;ide|walls and roof project about two feet beyond the walls at each end, &s;o as to form a kind of porch, in which there are benches for the accommodation of the family. That part of the floor which is allotted for the fire-place, is enclo&s;ed in a hollow &s;quare, by partitions either of wood or &s;tone, and in the middle of it the fire is kindled. The floor, along the in&s;ide of the walls, is thickly covered with &s;traw, and upon this the family &s;leep.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Furniture.</NOTE>Their furniture and implements con&s;i&s;t of but few articles, and one che&s;t commonly contains them all, except their provi&s;ion-ba&s;kets, the gourds that hold their fre&s;h water, and the hammers that are u&s;ed to beat their fern-root, which generally &s;tand without the door: &s;ome rude tools, their cloaths, arms, and a few feathers to &s;tick in their hair, make the re&s;t of their trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Some of the better &s;ort, who&s;e families are large, have three or four hou&s;es enclo&s;ed within a court-yard, the walls of which are con&s;tructed of poles and hay, and are about ten or twelve feet high.</P>
<P>When we were on &s;hore in the di&s;trict called Tolaga, we &s;aw the ruins, or rather the frame of a hou&s;e, for it had never been fini&s;hed, much &s;uperior in &s;ize to any that we &s;aw el&s;ewhere: it was thirty feet in length, about fifteen in breadth, and twelve high: the &s;ides of it were adorned with many carved planks, of a workman&s;hip much &s;uperior to any other that we had met with in the country; but for
<PB N="459" REF="55">
what purpo&s;e it was built, or why it was de&s;erted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> we could never learn.</P>
<P>But the&s;e people, though in their hou&s;es they are &s;o well defended from the inclemency of the weather, &s;eem to be quite indifferent whether they have any &s;helter at all during their excur&s;ions in &s;earch of fern roots and fi&s;h, &s;ometimes &s;etting up a &s;mall &s;hade to windward, and &s;ometimes alto|gether neglecting even that precaution, &s;leeping with their women and children under bu&s;hes, with their weapons ranged round them, in the manner that has already been de&s;cribed. The party con&s;i&s;ting of forty or fifty, whom we &s;aw at Mercury Bay, in a di&s;trict which the natives call Opoorage, never erected the lea&s;t &s;helter while we &s;taid there, though it &s;ometimes rained ince&s;&s;antly for four and twenty hours together.</P>
<P>The articles of their food have been enumerated already;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> the principal, which to them is what bread is to the inha|bitants of Europe, is the roots of the fern which grows upon the hills, and is nearly the &s;ame with what grows upon our high commons in England, and is called indifferently fern, bracken, or brakes. The birds which &s;ometimes &s;erve them for a fea&s;t, are chiefly penguins and albatro&s;&s;es, with a few other &s;pecies that have been occa&s;ionally mentioned in this narrative.</P>
<P>Having no ve&s;&s;el in which water can be boiled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cookery.</NOTE> their cookery con&s;i&s;ts wholly of baking and roa&s;ting. They bake nearly in the &s;ame manner as the inhabitants of the South Seas, and to the account that has been already given of their roa&s;ting, nothing need be added, but that the long &s;kewer or &s;pit to which the fle&s;h is fa&s;tened, is placed &s;toping towards the &s;ire, by &s;etting one &s;tone again&s;t the bottom of it, and &s;upporting it near the middle with another, by the moving
<PB N="460" REF="56">
of which to a greater or le&s;s di&s;tance from the end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> the de|gree of obliquity is increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>To the northward, as I have ob&s;erved, there are planta|tions of yams, &s;weet potatoes, and coccos, but we &s;aw no &s;uch to the &s;outhward; the inhabitants therefore of that part of the country mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t wholly upon fern root and fi&s;h, except the &s;canty and accidental re&s;ource which they may find in &s;ea fowl and dogs; and that fern and fi&s;h are not to be procured at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, even at the &s;ea &s;ide, and upon the neighbouring hills, is manife&s;t from the &s;tores of both that we &s;aw laid up dry, and the reluc|tance which &s;ome of them expre&s;&s;ed at &s;elling any part of them to us when we offered to purcha&s;e them, at lea&s;t the fi&s;h, for &s;ea &s;tores: and this particular &s;eems to confirm my opinion that this country &s;carcely &s;u&s;tains the pre&s;ent num|ber of its inhabitants, who are urged to perpetual ho&s;tilities by hunger, which naturally prompted them to eat the dead bodies of tho&s;e who were &s;lain in the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Water is their univer&s;al and only liquor, as far as we could di&s;cover, and if they have really no means of intoxica|tion, they are, in this particular, happy beyond any other people that we have yet &s;een or heard of.</P>
<P>As there is perhaps no &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;e either critical or chronic, but intemperance and inactivity, it cannot be thought &s;trange that the&s;e people enjoy perfect and uninter|rupted health: in all our vi&s;its to their towns, where young and old, men and women, crowded about us, prompted by the &s;ame curio&s;ity that carried us to look at them, we never &s;aw a &s;ingle per&s;on who appeared to have any bodily com|plaint, nor among the numbers that we have &s;een naked, did we once perceive the &s;lighte&s;t eruption upon the &s;kin, or any marks that an eruption had left behind: at fir&s;t, indeed,
<PB N="461" REF="57">
ob&s;erving that &s;ome of them when they came off to us were marked in patches with a white flowery appearance upon different parts of their bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> we thought that they were leperous, or highly &s;corbutic; but upon examination we found that the&s;e marks were owing to their having been wetted by the &s;prey of the &s;ea in their pa&s;&s;age, which, when it was dried away, left the &s;alts behind it in a fine white powder.</P>
<P>Another proof of health, which we have mentioned upon a former occa&s;ion, is the facility with which the wounds healed that had left &s;cars behind them, and that we &s;aw in a recent &s;tate; when we &s;aw the man who had been &s;hot with a mu&s;ket ball through the fle&s;hy part of his arm, his wound &s;eemed to be &s;o well dige&s;ted, and in &s;o fair a way of being perfectly healed, that if I had not known no application had been made to it, I &s;hould certainly have en|quired, with a very intere&s;ted curio&s;ity, after the vulnerary herbs and &s;urgical art of the country.</P>
<P>A farther proof that human nature is here untainted with di&s;ea&s;e, is the great number of old men that we &s;aw, many of whom, by the lo&s;s of their hair and teeth, appeared to be very ancient, yet none of them were decrepit, and though not equal to the young in mu&s;cular &s;trength, were not a whit behind them in cheerfulne&s;s and vivacity.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March. Canoes.</NOTE>THE ingenuity of the&s;e people appears in nothing more than in their canoes: they are long and narrow, and in &s;hape very much re&s;emble a New England whale boat: the larger &s;ort &s;eem to be built chiefly for war, and will carry from forty to eighty, or an hundred armed men. We mea&s;ured one which lay a&s;hore at Tolaga: &s;he was &s;ixty-eight feet and an half long, five feet broad, and three feet and an half deep; the bottom was &s;harp, with &s;trait &s;ides like a wedge, and con&s;i&s;ted of three lengths, hollowed out to about two inches, or an inch and an half thick, and well fa&s;tened together with &s;trong plaiting: each &s;ide con&s;i&s;ted of one intire plank, &s;ixty-three feet long, ten or twelve inches broad, and about an inch and quarter thick, and the&s;e were fitted and la&s;hed to the bottom part with great dexterity and &s;trength. A con&s;iderable number of thwarts were laid from gunwale to gunwale, to which they were &s;ecurely la&s;hed on each &s;ide, as a &s;trengthening to the boat. The ornament at the head projected five or &s;ix feet beyond the body, and was about four feet and an half high; the ornament at the &s;tern was fixed upon that end, as the &s;tern|po&s;t of a &s;hip is upon her keel, and was about fourteen feet high, two feet broad, and an inch and an half thick. They

both con&s;i&s;ted of boards of carved work,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> of which the de&s;ign was much better than the execution. All their canoes, ex|cept a few at Opoorage or Mercury Bay, which were of one piece, and hollowed by fire, are built after this plan, and few are le&s;s than twenty feet long: &s;ome of the &s;maller &s;ort have outriggers, and &s;ometimes two of them are joined together, but this is not common. The carving upon the &s;tern and head ornaments of the inferior boats, which &s;eem to be intended wholly for fi&s;hing, con&s;i&s;ts of the figure of a man, with a face as ugly as can be conceived, and a mon&s;trous tongue thru&s;t out of the mouth, with the white &s;hells of &s;ea-ears &s;tuck in for the eyes. But the canoes of the &s;uperior kind, which &s;eem to be their men of war, are magnificently adorned with open work, and co|vered with loo&s;e fringes of black feathers, which had a mo&s;t elegant appearance: the gunwale boards were al&s;o fre|quently carved in a grote&s;que ta&s;te, and adorned with tufts of white feathers placed upon a black ground. Of vi&s;ible objects that are wholly new, no verbal de&s;cription can con|vey a ju&s;t idea, but in proportion as they re&s;emble &s;ome that are already known, to which the mind of the reader mu&s;t be referred: the carving of the&s;e people being of a &s;ingular kind, and not in the likene&s;s of any thing that is known on our &s;ide of the ocean, either <Q>in the heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters that are under the earth,</Q> I mu&s;t refer wholly to the repre&s;entations which will be found of it in Plate XV.</P>
<P>The paddles are &s;mall, light, and neatly made; the blade is of an oval &s;hape, or rather of a &s;hape re&s;embling a large leaf, pointed at the bottom, broade&s;t in the middle, and gra|dually lo&s;ing it&s;elf in the &s;haft, the whole length being about &s;ix feet, of which the &s;haft or loom including the handle is
<PB N="464" REF="62">
four;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> and the blade two. By the help of the&s;e oars they pu&s;h on their boats with amazing velocity.</P>
<P>In &s;ailing they are not expert, having no art of going otherwi&s;e than before the wind: the &s;ail is of netting or matt, which is &s;et up between two poles that are fixed up|right upon each gunwale, and &s;erve both for ma&s;ts and yards: two ropes an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of &s;heets, and were con&s;equently fa&s;tened above to the top of each pole. But clum&s;y and inconvenient as this apparatus is, they make good way before the wind, and are &s;teered by two men who &s;it in the &s;tern, with each a paddle in his hand for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tools.</NOTE>Having &s;aid thus much of their workman&s;hip, I &s;hall now give &s;ome account of their tools; they have adzes, axes, and chi&s;&s;els, which &s;erve them al&s;o as augers for the boring of holes: as they have no metal, their adzes and axes are made of a hard black &s;tone, or of a green talc, which is not only hard but tough; and their chi&s;&s;els of human bone, or &s;mall fragments of ja&s;par, which they chip off from a block in &s;harp angular pieces like a gun-flint. Their axes they value above all that they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and never would part with one of them for any thing that we could give: I once offered one of the be&s;t axes I had in the &s;hip, be&s;ides a number of other things for one of them, but the owner would not &s;ell it; from which I conclude that good ones are &s;carce among them. Their &s;mall tools of ja&s;par, which are u&s;ed in fini&s;h|ing their nice&s;t work, they u&s;e till they are blunt, and then, as they have no means of &s;harpening them, throw them away. We had given the people at Tolaga a piece of gla&s;s, and in a &s;hort time they found means to drill a hole through it, in order to hang it round the neck as an ornament by a thread; and we imagine the tool mu&s;t have been a piece of this ja&s;par. How they bring their large tools fir&s;t to an
<PB N="465" REF="63">
edge, and &s;harpen the weapon which they call Patoo-Patoo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> we could not certainly learn; but probably it is by brui&s;ing the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance to powder, and, with this, grinding two pieces again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>Their nets, particularly their &s;eine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nets.</NOTE> which is of an enor|mous &s;ize, have been mentioned already: one of the&s;e &s;eems to be the joint work of a whole town, and I &s;uppo&s;e it to be the joint property al&s;o: the other net, which is circular, and extended by two or three hoops, has been particularly de|&s;cribed as well as the manner of baiting and u&s;ing it. Their hooks are of bone or &s;hell, and in general are ill made. To receive the fi&s;h when it is caught, and to hold their other provi&s;ions, they have ba&s;kets of various kinds and dimen|&s;ions, very neatly made of wicker work.</P>
<P>They excel in tillage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tillage.</NOTE> as might naturally be expected where the per&s;on that &s;ows is to eat the produce, and where there is &s;o little be&s;ides that can be eaten: when we fir&s;t came to TEGADOO, a di&s;trict between Poverty Bay and Ea&s;t Cape, their crops were ju&s;t covered, and had not yet begun to &s;prout; the mould was as &s;mooth as in a garden, and every root had its &s;mall hillock, ranged in a regular quin|cunx by lines, which with the pegs were &s;till remaining in the field. We had not an opportunity to &s;ee any of the&s;e hu&s;bandmen work, but we &s;aw what &s;erves them at once for &s;pade and plough: this in&s;trument is nothing more than a long narrow &s;take &s;harpened to an edge at one end, with a &s;hort piece fa&s;tened tran&s;ver&s;ely at a little di&s;tance above it, for the convenience of pre&s;&s;ing it down with the foot. With this they turn up pieces of ground &s;ix or &s;even acres in ex|tent, though it is not more than three inches broad; but as the &s;oil is light and &s;andy it makes little re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="64"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE>Tillage, weaving, and the other arts of peace, &s;eem to be be&s;t known and mo&s;t practi&s;ed in the northern part of this country; for there is little appearance of any of them in the South: but the arts of war flouri&s;h equally through the whole coa&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Weapons.</NOTE>Of weapons they have no great variety, but &s;uch as they have are well fitted for de&s;truction; they have &s;pears, darts, battle-axes, and the Patoo-Patoo. The &s;pear is fourteen or fifteen feet long, pointed at both ends, and &s;ometimes headed with bone: the&s;e are gra&s;ped by the middle, &s;o that the part behind balancing that before, makes a pu&s;h more difficult to be parried, than that of a weapon which is held by the end. The dart and other weapons have been &s;uffi|ciently de&s;cribed already; and it has al&s;o been remarked, that the&s;e people have neither &s;ling nor bow. They throw the dart by hand, and &s;o they do &s;tones; but darts and &s;tones are &s;eldom u&s;ed except in defending their forts. Their battles, whether in boats or on &s;hore, are generally hand to hand, and the &s;laughter mu&s;t con&s;equently be great, as a &s;econd blow with any of their weapons is unnece&s;&s;ary, if the fir&s;t takes place: their tru&s;t, however, &s;eems to be princi|pally placed in the Patoo-Patoo, which is fa&s;tened to their wri&s;ts by a &s;trong &s;trap, le&s;t it &s;hould be wrenched from them, and which the principal people generally wear &s;tick|ing in their girdles, con&s;idering it as a military ornament, and part of their dre&s;s, like the poinard of the A&s;iatic, and the &s;word of the European. They have no defen&s;ive armour; but, be&s;ides their weapons, the Chiefs carried a &s;taff of di&s;|tinction, in the &s;ame manner as our officers do the &s;pontoon: this was generally the rib of a whale, as white as &s;now, with many ornaments of carved work, dog's hair, and feathers; but &s;ometimes it was a &s;tick, about &s;ix feet long, adorned in

the &s;ame manner, and inlaid with a &s;hell like mother-of-pearl.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> Tho&s;e who bore this mark of di&s;tinction were generally old, at lea&s;t pa&s;t the middle age, and were al&s;o more marked with the <HI>Amoco</HI> than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>One or more per&s;ons, thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, always appeared in each canoe, when they came to attack us, according to the &s;ize of it. When they came within about a cable's length of the &s;hip, they u&s;ed to &s;top, and the Chiefs ri&s;ing from their &s;eat, put on a dre&s;s which &s;eemed appropriated to the occa|&s;ion, generally of dog's &s;kin, and holding out their decorated &s;taff, or a weapon, directed the re&s;t of the people what they &s;hould do. When they were at too great a di&s;tance to reach us with a lance or a &s;tone, they pre&s;umed that we had no wea|pon with which we could reach them; here then the de|fiance was given, and the words were almo&s;t univer&s;ally the &s;ame, <HI>Haromai, haromai, harre uta a Patoo-Patoo oge:</HI> <Q>Come to us, come on &s;hore, and we will kill you all with our Patoo-Patoos.</Q> While they were uttering the&s;e menaces they came gradually nearer and nearer, till they were clo&s;e along&s;ide; talking at intervals in a peaceable &s;train, and an|&s;wering any que&s;tions that we a&s;ked them; and at intervals renewing their defiance and threats, till being encouraged by our apparent timidity, they began their war-&s;ong and dance, as a prelude to an attack, which always followed, and was &s;ometimes continued till it became ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to repre&s;s them by firing &s;ome &s;mall-&s;hot; and &s;ome|times ended after throwing a few &s;tones on board, as if con|tent with having offered us an in&s;ult which we did not dare to revenge.</P>
<P>The war-dance con&s;i&s;ts of a great variety of violent mo|tions, and hideous contortions of the limbs, during which the countenance al&s;o performs its part: the tongue is fre|quently
<PB N="468" REF="67">
thru&s;t out to an incredible length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> and the eye-lids &s;o forcibly drawn up that the white appears both above and below, as well as on each &s;ide of the iris, &s;o as to form a circle round it; nor is any thing neglected that can render the human &s;hape frightful and deformed: at the &s;ame time they brandi&s;h their &s;pears, &s;hake their darts, and cleave the air with their Patoo-Patoos. This horrid dance is always accompanied by a &s;ong; it is wild indeed, but not di&s;agree|able, and every &s;train ends in a loud and deep &s;igh, which they utter in concert. In the motions of the dance, however horrid, there is a &s;trength, firmne&s;s, and agility, which we could not but behold with admiration; and in their &s;ong they keep time with &s;uch exactne&s;s, that I have often heard above an hundred paddles &s;truck again&s;t the &s;ides of their boats at once, &s;o as to produce but a &s;ingle &s;ound, at the divi&s;ions of their mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>A &s;ong not altogether unlike this, they &s;ometimes &s;ing without the dance, and as a peaceable amu&s;ement: they have al&s;o other &s;ongs which are &s;ung by the women, who&s;e voices are remarkably mellow and &s;oft, and have a plea&s;ing and tender effect; the time is &s;low, and the cadence mourn|ful; but it is conducted with more ta&s;te than could be ex|pected among the poor ignorant &s;avages of this half de&s;olate country; e&s;pecially as it appeared to us, who were none of us much acquainted with mu&s;ic as a &s;cience, to be &s;ung in parts; it was at lea&s;t &s;ung by many voices at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>They have &s;onorous in&s;truments, but they can &s;carcely be called in&s;truments of mu&s;ic; one is the &s;hell, called the Tri|ton's trumpet, with which they make a noi&s;e not unlike that which our boys &s;ometimes make with a cow's horn: the other is a &s;mall wooden pipe, re&s;embling a child's nine-pin, only much &s;maller, and in this there is no more mu&s;ic than
<PB N="469" REF="68">
in a pea-whi&s;tle.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> They &s;eem &s;en&s;ible indeed that the&s;e in|&s;truments are not mu&s;ical; for we never heard an attempt to &s;ing to them, or to produce with them any mea&s;ured tones that bore the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to a tune.</P>
<P>To what has been already &s;aid of the practice of eat|ing human fle&s;h, I &s;hall only add, that in almo&s;t every cove where we landed, we found fle&s;h bones of men near the places where fires had been made; and that among the heads that were brought on board by the old man, &s;ome &s;eemed to have fal&s;e eyes, and ornaments in their ears as if alive. That which Mr. Banks bought was &s;old with great reluc|tance by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: the head was manife&s;tly that of a young per&s;on about fourteen or fifteen years of age, and by the contu&s;ions on one &s;ide appeared to have received many violent blows, and indeed a part of the bone near the eye was wanting. The&s;e appearances confirmed us in the opi|nion that the natives of this country give no quarter, nor take any pri&s;oners to be killed and eaten at a future time, as is &s;aid to have been a practice among the Indians of Florida: for if pri&s;oners had been taken, this poor young creature, who cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of making much re&s;i&s;tance, would probably have been one, and we knew that he was killed with the re&s;t, for the fray had happened but a few days before.</P>
<P>The towns or Hippahs of the&s;e people, which are all for|tified, have been &s;ufficiently de&s;cribed already, and from the Bay of Plenty to Queen Charlotte's Sound they &s;eem to be the con&s;tant re&s;idence of the people: but about Poverty Bay, Hawk's Bay, Tegadoo, and Tolaga, we &s;aw no Hippahs, but &s;ingle hou&s;es &s;cattered at a di&s;tance from each other; yet upon the &s;ides of the hills there were &s;tages of a great length, furni&s;hed with &s;tones and darts, probably as retreats for the
<PB N="470" REF="69">
people at the la&s;t extremity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> as upon the&s;e &s;tages a fight may be carried on with much advantage again&s;t tho&s;e below, who may be reached with great effect by darts and &s;tones, which it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to throw up with equal force. And indeed the forts them&s;elves &s;eem to be no farther &s;erviceable than by enabling the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to repre&s;s a &s;udden attack; for as there is no &s;upply of water within the lines, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;u&s;tain a &s;iege. A con&s;iderable &s;tock of fern-root and dry fi&s;h is indeed laid up in them; but they may be re&s;erved again&s;t &s;ea&s;ons of &s;carcity, and that &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons there are, our ob&s;ervations left us no room to doubt; be&s;ides, while an enemy &s;hould be prowling in the neigh|bourhood, it would be ea&s;y to &s;natch a &s;upply of water from the &s;ide of the hill, though it would be impo&s;&s;ible to dig up fern root or catch fi&s;h.</P>
<P>In this di&s;trict, however, the people &s;eemed to live in a &s;tate of con&s;cious &s;ecurity, and to avail them&s;elves of their advantage: their plantations were more numerous, their canoes were more decorated, and they had not only finer carving, but finer clothes. This part of the coa&s;t al&s;o was much the mo&s;t populous, and po&s;&s;ibly their apparent peace and plenty might ari&s;e from their being united under one Chief, or King; for the inhabitants of all this part of the country told us, that they were the &s;ubjects of Teratu: when they pointed to the re&s;idence of this Prince, it was in a direc|tion which we thought inland; but which, when we knew the country better, we found to be the Bay of Plenty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE>It is much to be regretted that we were obliged to leave this country without knowing any thing of Teratu but his name. As an Indian monarch, his territory is certainly ex|ten&s;ive: he was acknowledged from Cape Kidnappers to the northward, and we&s;tward as far as the Bay of Plenty, a length
<PB N="471" REF="70">
of coa&s;t upwards of eighty leagues;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> and we do not yet know how much farther we&s;tward his dominions may extend. Po&s;&s;ibly the fortified towns which we &s;aw in the Bay of Plenty may be his barrier; e&s;pecially as at Mercury Bay he was not acknowledged, nor indeed any other &s;ingle Chief: for wherever we landed, or &s;poke with the people upon that coa&s;t, they told us that we were at but a &s;mall di&s;tance from their enemies.</P>
<P>In the dominions of Teratu we &s;aw &s;everal &s;ubordinate Chiefs, to whom great re&s;pect was paid, and by whom ju&s;|tice was probably admini&s;tered; for upon our complaint to one of them, of a theft that had been committed on board the &s;hip by a man that came with him, he gave him &s;everal blows and kicks, which the other received as the cha&s;ti&s;e|ment of authority, again&s;t which no re&s;i&s;tance was to be made, and which he had no right to re&s;ent. Whether this authority was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by appointment or inheritance we could not learn; but we ob&s;erved that the Chiefs, as well here as in other parts, were elderly men. In other parts, however, we learnt that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their authority by in|heritance.</P>
<P>The little &s;ocieties which we found in the &s;outhern parts &s;eemed to have &s;everal things in common, particularly their fine clothes and fi&s;hing nets. Their fine clothes, which po&s;|&s;ibly might be the &s;poils of war, were kept in a &s;mall hut, which was erected for that purpo&s;e in the middle of the town: the nets we &s;aw making in almo&s;t every hou&s;e, and the &s;everal parts being afterwards collected were joined together. Le&s;s account &s;eems to be made of the women here than in the South Sea i&s;lands; &s;uch at lea&s;t was the opinion of Tupia, who complained of it as an indignity to the &s;ex. We ob|&s;erved that the two &s;exes eat together; but how they divide
<PB N="472" REF="71">
their labour we do not certainly know.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> I am inclined to be|lieve that the men till the ground, make nets, catch birds, and go out in their boats to fi&s;h; and that the women dig up fern roots, collect lob&s;ters and other &s;hell fi&s;h near the beach, dre&s;s the victuals, and weave cloth: &s;uch at lea&s;t were their employments when we had an opportunity of ob&s;erv|ing them, which was but &s;eldom; for in general our ap|pearance made a holiday wherever we went, men, women and children, flocking round us, either to gratify their curio|&s;ity, or to purcha&s;e &s;ome of the valuable merchandize which we carried about with us, con&s;i&s;ting principally of nails, paper, and broken gla&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE>Of the religion of the&s;e people it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that we could learn much; they acknowledge the influence of &s;uperior beings, one of whom is &s;upreme, and the re&s;t &s;ub|ordinate; and gave nearly the &s;ame account of the origin of the world, and the production of mankind, as our friends in Otaheite: Tupia, however, &s;eemed to have a much more deep and exten&s;ive knowlege of the&s;e &s;ubjects than any of the people here; and whenever he was di&s;po&s;ed to in&s;truct them, which he &s;ometimes did in a long di&s;cour&s;e, he was &s;ure of a numerous audience, who li&s;tened in profound &s;ilence, with &s;uch reverence and attention, that we could not but wi&s;h them a better teacher.</P>
<P>What homage they pay to the deities they acknowledge we could not learn; but we &s;aw no place of public wor&s;hip, like the Morals of the South Sea i&s;lands: yet we &s;aw, near a plantation of &s;weet potatoes, a &s;mall area, of a &s;quare figure, &s;urrounded with &s;tones, in the middle of which one of the &s;harpened &s;takes which they u&s;e as a &s;pade was &s;et up, and upon it was hung a ba&s;ket of fern roots: upon enquiry, the natives told us, that it was an offering to the gods, by which
<PB N="473" REF="72">
the owner hoped to render them propitious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> and obtain a plentiful crop.</P>
<P>As to their manner of di&s;po&s;ing of their dead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dead.</NOTE> we could form no certain opinion of it, for the accounts that we re|ceived by no means agreed. In the northern parts, they told us that they buried them in the ground; and in the &s;outh|ern, that they threw them into the &s;ea: it is however certain that we &s;aw no grave in the country, and that they affected to conceal every thing relating to their dead with a kind of my&s;terious &s;ecrecy. But whatever may be the &s;epulchre, the living are them&s;elves the monuments; for we &s;aw &s;carcely a &s;ingle per&s;on of either &s;ex who&s;e body was not marked by the &s;cars of wounds which they had inflicted upon them|&s;elves as a te&s;timony of their regret for the lo&s;s of a relation or friend: &s;ome of the&s;e wounds we &s;aw in a &s;tate &s;o recent that the blood was &s;carcely &s;taunched, which &s;hows that death had been among them while we were upon the coa&s;t; and makes it more extraordinary that no funeral ceremony &s;hould have fallen under our notice: &s;ome of the &s;cars were very large and deep, and in many in&s;tances had greatly disfigured the face. One monument indeed we ob&s;erved of another kind, the cro&s;s that was &s;et up near Queen Char|lotte's Sound.</P>
<P>Having now given the be&s;t account in my power of the cu&s;toms and opinions of the inhabitants of New Zealand, with their boats, nets, furniture, and dre&s;s, I &s;hall only re|mark, that the &s;imilitude between the&s;e particulars here and in the South Sea i&s;lands is a very &s;trong proof that the inha|bitants have the &s;ame origin; and that the common ance&s;|tors of both, were natives of the &s;ame country. They have both a tradition that their ance&s;tors, at a very remote period of time, came from another country; and, according to the
<PB N="474" REF="73">
tradition of both,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> that the name of that country was HEA|WIJE; but the &s;imilitude of the language &s;eems to put the matter altogether out of doubt. I have already ob&s;erved, that Tupia, when he acco&s;ted the people here in the language of his own country, was perfectly under&s;tood; and I &s;hall give a &s;pecimen of the &s;imilitude by a li&s;t of words in both lan|guages, according to the dialect of the northern and &s;outh|ern i&s;lands of which New Zealand con&s;i&s;ts, by which it will appear that the language of Otaheite does not differ more from that of New Zealand, than the language of the two i&s;lands from each other.</P>

<P>By this &s;pecimen, I think it appears to demon&s;tration that the language of New Zealand and Otaheite is radically the &s;ame. The language of the northern and &s;outhern parts of New Zealand differs chiefly in the pronunciation, as the &s;ame Engli&s;h word is pronounced <HI>gate</HI> in Middle&s;ex, and <HI>ge&auml;te</HI> in York&s;hire: and as the &s;outhern and northern words were not written down by the &s;ame per&s;on, one might po&s;|&s;ibly
<PB N="476" REF="75">
u&s;e more letters to produce the &s;ame &s;ound than the other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE></P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve, that it is the genius of the language, e&s;pecially in the &s;outhern parts, to put &s;ome article before a noun, as we do <HI>the</HI> or <HI>a</HI>; the articles u&s;ed here were generally <HI>he</HI> or <HI>ko:</HI> it is al&s;o common here to add the word <HI>&ouml;eia</HI> after another word, as an iteration, e&s;pecially if it is an an&s;wer to a que&s;tion; as we &s;ay <HI>yes indeed, to be &s;ure, really, certainly:</HI> this &s;ometimes led our gentlemen into the formation of words of an enormous length, judging by the ear only, without being able to refer each &s;ound into its &s;ignification. An example will make this perfectly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>In the Bay of I&s;lands there is a remarkable one, called by the natives MATU ARO. One of our gentlemen having a&s;ked a native the name of it, he an&s;wered, with the particle, <HI>Ke|matuaro</HI>; the gentleman hearing the &s;ound imperfectly, re|peated his que&s;tion, and the Indian repeating his an&s;wer, added <HI>&ouml;eia,</HI> which made the word <HI>Kematuaro&ouml;eia</HI>; and thus it happened that in the log book I found <HI>Matuaro</HI> transformed into <HI>Cumettiwarroweia:</HI> and the &s;ame trans|formation, by the &s;ame means, might happen to an Engli&s;h word. Suppo&s;e a native of New Zealand at Hackney church, to enquire "what village is this?" the an&s;wer would be, "it is Hackney:" &s;uppo&s;e the que&s;tion to be re|peated with an air of doubt and uncertainty, the an&s;wer might be "it is Hackney indeed," and the New Zealander, if he had the u&s;e of letters, would probably record, for the information of his countrymen, that during his re&s;idence among us he had vi&s;ited a village called "Ity&s;hakneeindede." The article u&s;ed by the inhabitants of the South Sea i&s;lands, in&s;tead of <HI>he</HI> or <HI>ko,</HI> is <HI>to</HI> or <HI>ta,</HI> but the word <HI>&ouml;eia</HI> is common to both; and when we began to learn the language, it led us into many ridiculous mi&s;takes.</P>
<P><PB N="477" REF="76">But &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e i&s;lands, and tho&s;e in the South Seas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> to have been peopled originally from the &s;ame country, it will perhaps for ever remain a doubt what country that is: we were, however, unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that the people did not come from America, which lies to the ea&s;tward; and ex|cept there &s;hould appear to be a continent to the &s;outhward, in a moderate latitude, it will follow that they came from the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>Thus far our navigation has certainly been unfavourable to the notion of a &s;outhern continent, for it has &s;wept away at lea&s;t three-fourths of the po&s;itions upon which it has been founded. The principal navigators, who&s;e authority has been urged on this occa&s;ion, are Ta&s;man, Juan Fernandes, Hermite, the commander of a Dutch &s;quadron, Quiros, and Roggewein; and the track of the Endeavour has demon&s;trated that the land &s;een by the&s;e per&s;ons, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be part of a continent, is not &s;o; it has al&s;o totally &s;ubverted the the|oretical arguments which have been brought to prove that the exi&s;tence of a &s;outhern continent is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve an equilibrium between the two hemi&s;pheres; for upon this principle what we have already proved to be water, would render the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere too light. In our rout to the northward, after doubling Cape Horn, when we were in the latitude of 40&deg;, our longitude was 110&deg;; and in our re|turn to the &s;outhward, after leaving Ulietea, when we were again in latitude 40&deg;, our longitude was 145&deg;; the difference is 35&deg;. When we were in latitude 30&deg; the difference of lon|gitude between the two tracks was 21&deg;, which continued till we were as low as 20&deg;; but a &s;ingle view of the chart will convey a better idea of this than the mo&s;t minute de&s;crip|tion: yet as upon a view of the chart it will appear that there is a large &s;pace extending quite to the Tropics, which
<PB N="478" REF="77">
neither we,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> nor any other navigators to our knowlege have explored, and as there will appear to be room enough for the Cape of a &s;outhern continent to extend northward into a low &s;outhern latitude, I &s;hall give my rea&s;ons for believing there is no Cape, of any &s;outhern continent, to the north|ward of 40&deg; &s;outh.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what has been laid down by &s;ome geo|graphers in their maps, and alleged by Mr. Dalrymple, with re&s;pect to Quiros, it is improbable in the highe&s;t degree that he &s;aw to the &s;outhward of two i&s;lands, which he di&s;covered in latitude 25 or 26, and which I &s;uppo&s;e may lie between the longitude of 130&deg; and 140&deg; W. any &s;igns of a continent, much le&s;s any thing which, in his opinion, was a known or indubitable &s;ign of &s;uch land; for if he had, he would cer|tainly have &s;ailed &s;outhward in &s;earch of it, and if he had &s;ought, &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;igns to have been indubitable, he mu&s;t have found: the di&s;covery of a &s;outhern continent was the ultimate object of Quiros's voyage, and no man appears to have had it more at heart; &s;o that if he was in latitude 26&deg; S. and in longitude 146&deg; W. where Mr. Dalrymple has placed the i&s;lands he di&s;covered, it may fairly be inferred that no part of a &s;outhern continent extends to that latitude.</P>
<P>It will, I think, appear with equal evidence from the ac|counts of Roggewein's voyage, that between the longitudes of 130&deg; and 150&deg; W. there is no main land to the northward of 35&deg; S. Mr. Pingre, in a treati&s;e concerning the tran&s;it of Venus, which he went out to ob&s;erve, has in&s;erted an extract of Roggewein's voyage, and a map of the South Seas; and for rea&s;ons which may be &s;een at large in his work, &s;uppo&s;es him, after leaving Ea&s;ter I&s;land, which he places in latitude 28 &frac12; S. longitude 123&deg; W. to have &s;teered S.W. as high as
<PB N="479" REF="78">
34&deg; S. and afterwards W.N.W.;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> and if this was indeed his rout, the proof that there is no main land to the northward of 35&deg; S. is irrefragable. Mr. Dalrymple indeed &s;uppo&s;es his rout to have been different, and that from Ea&s;ter I&s;le he &s;teered N.W. taking a cour&s;e afterwards very little different from that of La Maire; but I think it is highly improbable that a man, who at his own reque&s;t was &s;ent to di&s;cover a &s;outhern continent, &s;hould take a cour&s;e in which La Maire had already proved no continent could be found: it mu&s;t however be confe&s;&s;ed, that Roggewein's track cannot certainly be a&s;certained, becau&s;e in the accounts that have been pub|li&s;hed of his voyage, neither longitudes nor latitudes are mentioned. As to my&s;elf I &s;aw nothing that I thought a &s;ign of land, in my rout either to the northward, &s;outhward, or we&s;tward, till a few days before I made the ea&s;t coa&s;t of New Zealand: I did indeed frequently &s;ee large flocks of birds, but they were generally &s;uch as are found at a very remote di&s;tance from any coa&s;t; and it is al&s;o true that I frequently &s;aw pieces of rock-weed, but I could not infer the vicinity of land from the&s;e, becau&s;e I have been informed, upon indu|bitable authority, that a con&s;iderable quantity of the beans called <HI>ox-eyes,</HI> which are known to grow no where but in the We&s;t Indies, are every year thrown up on the coa&s;t of Ire|land, which is not le&s;s than twelve hundred leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Thus have I given my rea&s;ons for thinking that there is no continent to the northward of latitude 40&deg; S.; of what may lie farther to the &s;outhward than 40&deg; I can give no opinion; but I am &s;o far from wi&s;hing to di&s;courage any future attempt, finally to determine a que&s;tion which has long been an object of attention to many nations; that now this voyage has reduced the only po&s;&s;ible &s;cite of a continent in the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere, north of latitude 40&deg;, to &s;o &s;mall a
<PB N="480" REF="79">
&s;pace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. March.</NOTE> I think it would be pity to leave that any longer un|examined, e&s;pecially as the voyage may turn to good ac|count, be&s;ides determining the principal que&s;tion, if no con|tinent &s;hould be found, by the di&s;covery of new i&s;lands in the Tropical regions, of which there is probably a great number, that no European ve&s;&s;el has ever yet vi&s;ited. Tupia from time to time gave us an account of about one hundred and thirty, and in a chart drawn by his own hand, he actu|ally laid down no le&s;s than &s;eventy-four.</P>

At about two o'clock the wind came about to the W. S. W. upon which we tacked and &s;tood to the N. W.; &s;oon after a &s;mall land-bird perched upon the rigging, but we had no ground with 120 fathom. At eight we wore and &s;tood to the &s;outhward till twelve at night, and then wore and &s;tood to the N. W. till four in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 17.</NOTE> when we again &s;tood to the &s;outhward, having a fre&s;h gale at W. S. W. with &s;qualls and dark weather till nine, when the weather became clear, and there being little wind, we had an opportunity to take &s;everal ob&s;ervations of the &s;un and moon, the mean re&s;ult of which gave 207&deg; 56&prime;W. longi|tude: our latitude at noon was 39&deg; 36&prime; S. We had now a hard gale from the &s;outhward, and a great &s;ea from the &s;ame quarter, which obliged us to run under our fore-&s;ail and mizen all night, during which we &s;ounded every two hours, but had no ground with 120 fathom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 18.</NOTE>In the morning of the 18th, we &s;aw two Port Egmont hens, and a pintado bird, which are certain &s;igns of ap|proaching land, and indeed by our reckoning we could not be far from it, for our longitude was now one degree to the we&s;tward of the ea&s;t&s;ide of Van Diemen's land, according to
<PB N="483" REF="85">
the longitude laid down by Ta&s;man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Wedne&s;. 18.</NOTE> whom we could not &s;uppo&s;e to have erred much in &s;o &s;hort a run as from this land to New Zealand, and by our latitude we could not be above fifty or fifty-five leagues from the place whence he took his departure. All this day we had frequent &s;qualls and a great &s;well.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 19.</NOTE> Atone in the morning we brought to and &s;ounded, but had no ground with 130 fathom; at &s;ix we &s;aw land extending from N. E. to W. at the di&s;tance of five or &s;ix leagues, having eighty fathom water with a fine &s;andy bottom.</P>
<P>We continued &s;tanding we&s;tward, with the wind at S. S. W. till eight, when we made all the &s;ail we could, and bore away along the &s;hore N. E. for the ea&s;termo&s;t land in fight, being at this time in latitude 37&deg; 58&prime; S. and longitude 210&deg; 39&prime; W. The &s;outhermo&s;t point of land in &s;ight, which bore from us W. &frac14; S. I judged to lie in latitude 38&deg;, longitude 211&deg; 7&prime;, and gave it the name of POINT HICKS, becau&s;e Mr. Hicks, the Fir&s;t Lieutenant, was the fir&s;t who di&s;covered it. To the &s;outhward of this Point no land was to be &s;een, though it was very clear in that quarter, and by our longitude, com|pared with that of Ta&s;man, not as it is laid down in the printed charts, but in the extracts from Ta&s;man's journal, publi&s;hed by Rembrant&s;e, the body of Van Diemen's land ought to have borne due &s;outh; and indeed, from the &s;udden falling of the &s;ea after the wind abated, I had rea&s;on to think it did; yet as I did not &s;ee it, and as I found this coa&s;t trend N. E. and S. W. or rather more to the ea&s;tward, I can|not determine whether it joins to Van Diemen's land or not.</P>
<P>At noon, we were in latitude 37&deg; 50&prime;, longitude 210&deg; 29&prime;W. The extreams of the land extended from N. W. to E. N. E and a remarkable point bore N. 20 E. at the di&s;tance of about four
<PB N="484" REF="86">
leagues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Thur&s;day 19.</NOTE> This point ri&s;es in a round hillock, very much re&s;embling the Ram Head at the entrance of Plymouth Sound, and therefore I called it by the &s;ame name. The va|riation by an azimuth, taken this morning, was 3&deg; 7&prime; E.; and what we had now &s;een of the land, appeared low and level: the &s;ea &s;hore was a white &s;and, but the country within was green and woody. About one o'clock, we &s;aw three water &s;pouts at once; two were between us and the &s;hore, and the third at &s;ome di&s;tance, upon our larboard quarter: this phae|nomenon is &s;o well known, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to give a particular de&s;cription of it here.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the evening, we &s;hortened &s;ail, and brought to for the night, having fifty-&s;ix fathom water, and a fine &s;andy bottom. The northermo&s;t land in &s;ight then bore N. by E. &frac12; E. and a &s;mall i&s;land lying clo&s;e to a point on the main bore W. di&s;tant two leagues. This point, which I called CAPE HOWE, may be known by the trending of the coa&s;t, which is north on the one &s;ide, and &s;outh we&s;t on the other; it may al&s;o be known by &s;ome round hills upon the main, ju&s;t within it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 20.</NOTE>We brought to for the night, and at four in the morning made &s;ail along &s;hore to the northward. At &s;ix, the norther|mo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. N. W. and we were at this time about four leagues from the &s;hore. At noon, we were in latitude 36&deg; 51&prime; S. longitude 209&deg; 53&prime; W. and about three leagues di&s;tant from the &s;hore. The weather being clear, gave us a good view of the country, which has a very plea&s;ing appearance: it is of a moderate height, diver&s;ified by hills and vallies, ridges and plains, inter&s;per&s;ed with a few lawns of no great extent, but in general covered with wood: the a&s;cent of the hills and ridges is gentle, and the &s;ummits are not high. We continued to &s;ail along the &s;hore
<PB N="485" REF="87">
to the northward, with a &s;outherly wind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Friday 20.</NOTE> and in the after|noon we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places, by which we knew the country to be inhabited. At &s;ix in the evening, we &s;hortened &s;ail, and &s;ounded: we found forty-four fathom water, with a clear &s;andy bottom, and &s;tood on under an ea&s;y &s;ail till twelve, when we brought to for the night, and had ninety fathom water.</P>
<P>At four in the morning, we made &s;ail again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 21.</NOTE> at the di&s;|tance of about five leagues from the land, and at &s;ix, we were abrea&s;t of a high mountain, lying near the &s;hore, which, on account of its figure, I called MOUNT DROME|DARY: under this mountain the &s;hore forms a point, to which I gave the name of POINT DROMEDARY, and over it there is a peaked hillock. At this time, being in latitude 36&deg; 18&prime; S. longitude 209&deg; 55&prime; W. we found the variation to be 10&deg; 42&prime; E.</P>
<P>Between ten and eleven, Mr. Green and I took &s;everal ob|&s;ervations of the &s;un and moon, the mean re&s;ult of which gave 209&deg; 17&prime; longitude W. By an ob&s;ervation made the day before, our longitude was 210&deg; 9&prime; W. from which, 20&prime; being &s;ubtracted, there remains 209&deg; 49&prime; the longitude of the &s;hip this day at noon, the mean of which, with this day's ob&s;er|vation, gives 209&deg; 33&prime;, by which I fix the longitude of this coa&s;t. At noon, our latitude was 35&deg; 49&prime; S. Cape Drome|dary bore S, 30 W. at the di&s;tance of twelve leagues, and an open bay, in which were three or four &s;mall i&s;lands, bore N. W. by W. at the di&s;tance of five or &s;ix leagues. This bay &s;eemed to afford but little &s;helter from the &s;ea winds, and yet it is the only place where there appeared a probability of finding anchorage upon the whole coa&s;t. We continued to &s;teer along the &s;hore N. by E. and N. N. E. at the di&s;tance of about three leagues, and &s;aw &s;moke in many places near
<PB N="486" REF="88">
the beach.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Saturday 21.</NOTE> At five in the evening, we were abrea&s;t of a point of land which ro&s;e in a perpendicular cliff, and which, for that rea&s;on, I called POINT UPRIGHT. Our latitude was 35&deg; 35&prime; S. when this Point bore from us due we&s;t, di&s;tant about two leagues: in this &s;ituation, we had about thirty-one fathom water with a &s;andy bottom. At &s;ix in the even|ing, the wind falling, we hauled off E. N. E. and at this time the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. by E. &frac12; E. At mid|night, being in &s;eventy fathom water, we brought to till four in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 22.</NOTE> when we made &s;ail in for the land; but at day-break, found our &s;ituation nearly the &s;ame as it had been at five the evening before, by which it was appa|rent that we had been driven about three leagues to the &s;outhward, by a tide or current, during the night. After this we &s;teered along the &s;hore N. N. E. with a gentle breeze at S. W. and were &s;o near the land as to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;everal of the natives upon the beach, who appeared to be of a black, or very dark colour. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 35&deg; 27&prime; S. and longitude 209&deg; 23&prime;W. Cape Dromedary bore S. 28 W. di&s;tant nineteen leagues, a remarkable peaked hill, which re&s;embled a &s;quare dove-hou&s;e, with a dome at the top, and which for that rea&s;on I called the PIGEON HOUSE, bore N. 32&deg; 30&prime; W. and a &s;mall low i&s;land, which lay clo&s;e under the &s;hore, bore N. W. di&s;tant about two or three leagues. When I fir&s;t di&s;covered this i&s;land, in the morn|ing, I was in hopes, from its appearance, that I &s;hould have found &s;helter for the &s;hip behind it, but when we came near it, it did not promi&s;e &s;ecurity even for the landing of a boat: I &s;hould however have attempted to &s;end a boat on &s;hore, if the wind had not veered to that direction, with a large hol|low &s;ea rolling in upon the land from the S. E. which indeed had been the ca&s;e ever &s;ince we had been upon it. The coa&s;t &s;till continued to be of a moderate height, forming alter|nately
<PB N="487" REF="89">
rocky points and &s;andy beaches; but within,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Sunday 22.</NOTE> between Mount Dromedary and the Pigeon Hou&s;e, we &s;aw high mountains, which, except two, are covered with wood: the&s;e two lie inland behind the Pigeon Hou&s;e, and are re|markably flat at the top, with &s;teep rocky cliffs all round them, as far as we could &s;ee. The trees which almo&s;t every where clothe this country, appear to be large and lofty. This day the variation was found to be 9&deg; 50&prime; E. and for the two la&s;t days, the latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was twelve or fourteen miles to the &s;outhward of the &s;hip's account, which could have been the effect of nothing but a current &s;etting in that direction. About four in the afternoon, being near five leagues from the land, we tacked and &s;tood off S. E. and E. and the wind having veered in the night, from E. to N. E. and N. we tacked about four in the morning, and &s;tood in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 23.</NOTE> being then about nine or ten leagues from the &s;hore. At eight, the wind began to die away, and &s;oon after it was calm. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 35&deg; 38&prime;, and our di&s;tance from the land about &s;ix leagues. Cape Dro|medary bore S. 37 W. di&s;tant &s;eventeen leagues, and the Pigeon Hou&s;e N. 40 W.: in this &s;ituation we had &s;eventy-four fathom water. In the afternoon, we had variable light airs and calms, till &s;ix in the evening, when a breeze &s;prung up at N. by W.: at this time, being about four or five leagues from the &s;hore, we had &s;eventy fathom water. The Pigeon Hou&s;e bore N. 45 W. Mount Dromedary S. 30 W. and the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight N. 19 E.</P>
<P>We &s;tood to the north ea&s;t till noon the next day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 24.</NOTE> with a gentle breeze at N. W. and then we tacked and &s;tood we&s;t|ward. At this time, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 35&deg; 10&prime;S. and longitude 208&deg; 51&prime; W. A point of land which I had di&s;covered on St. George's day, and which therefore I called CAPE GEORGE, bore W. di&s;tant nineteen miles, and the

Pigeon Hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Tue&s;day 24.</NOTE> (the latitude and longitude of which I found to be 35&deg; 19&prime; S. and 209&deg; 42&prime;W.) S. 75 W. In the morning, we had found the variation, by amplitude, to be 7&deg; 50&prime; E. and by &s;everal azimuths 7&deg; 54&prime; E. We had a fre&s;h breeze at N. W. from noon till three; it then came to the we&s;t, when we tacked and &s;tood to the northward. At five in the even|ing, being about five or &s;ix leagues from the &s;hore, with the Pigeon Hou&s;e bearing W. S. W. di&s;tant about nine leagues, we had eighty-&s;ix fathom water; and at eight, having thun|der and lightning, with heavy &s;qualls, we brought to in 120 fathom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 25.</NOTE>At three in the morning, we made &s;ail again to the north|ward, having the advantage of a fre&s;h gale at S. W. At noon, we were about three or four leagues from the &s;hore, and in latitude 34&deg; 22&prime; S. longitude 208&deg; 36&prime; W. In the cour&s;e of this day's run from the preceding noon, which was forty-five miles north ea&s;t, we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places near the beach. About two leagues to the northward of Cape George, the &s;hore &s;eemed to form a bay, which pro|mi&s;ed &s;helter from the north ea&s;t winds, but as the wind was with us, it was not in my power to look into it without beating up, which would have co&s;t me more time than I was willing to &s;pare. The north point of this bay, on account of its figure, I named LONG NOSE; its latitude is 35&deg; 6&prime;, and about eight leagues north of it there lies a point, which, from the colour of the land about it, I called RED POINT: its latitude is 34&deg; 29&prime;, and longitude 208&deg; 45&prime;W. To the north we&s;t of Red Point, and a little way inland, &s;tands a round hill, the top of which looks like the crown of a hat. In the after|noon of this day, we had a light breeze at N. N. W. till five in the evening, when it fell calm: at this time, we were be|tween three and four leagues from the &s;hore, and had forty-eight fathom water: the variation by azimuth was 8&deg; 48&prime; E.
<PB N="489" REF="91">
and the extremities of this land were from N. E. by N. to S. W. by S. Before it was dark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Wedne&s;. 23.</NOTE> we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places along the &s;hore, and a fire two or three times after|wards. During the night we lay becalmed, driving in be|fore the &s;ea till one in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 26.</NOTE> when we got a breeze from the land, with which we &s;teered N. E. being then in thirty-eight fathom. At noon, it veered to N. E. by N. and we were then in latitude 34&deg; 10&prime; S. longitude 208&deg; 27&prime; W.: the land was di&s;tant about five leagues, and extended from S. 37 W. to N. &frac12; E. In this latitude, there are &s;ome white cliffs, which ri&s;e perpendicularly from the &s;ea to a con|&s;iderable height. We &s;tood off the &s;hore till two o'clock, and then tacked and &s;tood in till &s;ix, when we were within four or five miles of it, and at that di&s;tance had fifty fathom water. The extremities of the land bore from S. 28 W. to N. 25&deg; 30 E. We now tacked and &s;tood off till twelve, then tacked and &s;tood in again till four in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 27.</NOTE> when we made a trip off till daylight; and during all this time we lo&s;t ground, owing to the variablene&s;s of the winds. We con|tinued at the di&s;tance of between four and five miles from the &s;hore, till the afternoon, when we came within two miles, and I then hoi&s;ted out the pinnace and yawl to attempt a landing, but the pinnace proved to be &s;o leaky that I was obliged to hoi&s;t her in again. At this time we &s;aw &s;everal of the natives walking bri&s;kly along the &s;hore, four of whom carried a &s;mall canoe upon their &s;houlders: we flattered our&s;elves that they were going to put her into the water, and come off to the &s;hip, but finding our&s;elves di&s;|appointed, I determined to go on &s;hore in the yawl, with as many as it would carry: I embarked therefore, with only Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Tupia, and four rowers: we pulled for that part of the &s;hore where the Indians appeared, near which four &s;mall canoes were lying at the water's edge,
<PB N="490" REF="92">
The Indians &s;at down upon the rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Friday 27.</NOTE> and &s;eemed to wait for our landing; but to our great regret, when we came with|in about a quarter of a mile, they ran away into the woods: we determined however to go a&s;hore, and endeavour to pro|cure an interview, but in this we were again di&s;appointed, for we found &s;o great a &s;urf beating upon every part of the beach, that landing with our little boat was altogether im|practicable: we were therefore obliged to be content with gazing at &s;uch objects as pre&s;ented them&s;elves from the water: the canoes, upon a near view, &s;eemed very much to re&s;emble tho&s;e of the &s;maller &s;ort at New Zealand. We ob|&s;erved, that among the trees on &s;hore, which were not very large, there was no underwood; and could di&s;tingui&s;h that many of them were of the palm kind, and &s;ome of them cabbage trees: after many a wi&s;hful look we were obliged to return, with our curio&s;ity rather excited than &s;atisfied, and about five in the evening got on board the &s;hip. About this time it fell calm, and our &s;ituation was by no means agree|able: we were now not more than a mile and a half from the &s;hore, and within &s;ome breakers, which lay to the &s;outh|ward, but happily a light breeze came off the land, and car|ried us out of danger: with this breeze we &s;tood to the northward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 28.</NOTE> and at day-break we di&s;covered a bay, which &s;eemed to be well &s;heltered from all winds, and into which therefore I determined to go with the &s;hip. The pinnace being repaired, I &s;ent her, with the Ma&s;ter, to &s;ound the entrance, while I kept turning up, having the wind right out. At noon, the mouth of the bay bore N. N. W. di&s;tant about a mile, and &s;eeing a &s;moke on the &s;hore, we directed our gla&s;&s;es to the &s;pot, and &s;oon di&s;covered ten people, who, upon our nearer approach, left their fire, and retired to a little eminence, whence they could conveniently ob&s;erve our motions. Soon after two canoes, each having two men on
<PB N="491" REF="93">
board, came to the &s;hore ju&s;t under the eminence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Saturday 28.</NOTE> and the men joined the re&s;t on the top of it. The pinnace, which had been &s;ent ahead to &s;ound, now approached the place, upon which all the Indians retired farther up the hill, ex|cept one, who hid him&s;elf among &s;ome rocks near the landing-place. As the pinnace proceeded along the &s;hore, mo&s;t of the people took the &s;ame route, and kept abrea&s;t of her at a di&s;tance; when &s;he came back, the ma&s;ter told us, that in a cove a little within the harbour, &s;ome of them had come down to the beach, and invited him to land by many &s;igns and words of which he knew not the meaning; but that all of them were armed with long pikes, and a wooden weapon &s;haped &s;omewhat like a cimeter. The Indians who had not followed the boat, &s;eeing the &s;hip approach, u&s;ed many threatening ge&s;tures, and brandi&s;hed their weapons; particularly two, who made a very &s;ingular appearance, for their faces &s;eemed to have been du&s;ted with a white powder, and their bodies painted with broad &s;treaks of the &s;ame co|lour, which pa&s;&s;ing obliquely over their brea&s;ts and backs, looked not unlike the cro&s;s-belts worn by our &s;oldiers; the &s;ame kind of &s;treaks were al&s;o drawn round their legs and thighs like broad garters: each of the&s;e men held in his hand the weapon that had been de&s;cribed to us as like a cimeter, which appeared to be about two feet and a half long, and they &s;eemed to talk to each other with great ear|ne&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;tand into the bay, and early in the after|noon anchored under the &s;outh &s;hore, about two miles with|in the entrance, in &s;ix fathom water, the &s;outh point bearing S. E. and the north point Ea&s;t. As we came in we &s;aw, on both points of the bay, a few huts, and &s;everal of the natives, men, women, and children. Under the &s;outh head
<PB N="492" REF="94">
we &s;aw four &s;mall canoes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Saturday 28.</NOTE> with each one man on board, who were very bu&s;ily employed in &s;triking fi&s;h with a long pike or &s;pear: they ventured almo&s;t into the &s;urf, and were &s;o intent upon what they were doing, that although the &s;hip pa&s;&s;ed within a quarter of a mile of them, they &s;carcely turned their eyes towards her; po&s;&s;ibly being deafened by the &s;urf, and their attention wholly fixed upon their bu&s;ine&s;s or &s;port, they neither &s;aw nor heard her go pa&s;t them.</P>
<P>The place where the &s;hip had anchored was abrea&s;t of a &s;mall village, con&s;i&s;ting of about &s;ix or eight hou&s;es; and while we were preparing to hoi&s;t out the boat, we &s;aw an old woman, followed by three children, come out of the wood; &s;he was loaded with fire-wood, and each of the children had al&s;o its little burden: when &s;he came to the hou&s;es three more children, younger than the others, came out to meet her: &s;he often looked at the &s;hip, but expre&s;&s;ed neither fear nor &s;urpri&s;e: in a &s;hort time &s;he kindled a fire, and the four canoes came in from fi&s;hing. The men landed, and having hauled up their boars, began to dre&s;s their dinner, to all appearance wholly unconcerned about us, though we were within half a mile of them. We thought it remark|able that of all the people we had yet &s;een, not one had the lea&s;t appearance of clothing, the old woman her&s;elf being de&s;titute even of a fig-leaf.</P>
<P>After dinner the boats were manned, and we &s;et out from the &s;hip, having Tupia of our party. We intended to land where we &s;aw the people, and began to hope that as they had &s;o little regarded the &s;hip's coming into the bay, they would as little regard our coming on &s;hore: in this, how|ever, we were di&s;appointed; for as &s;oon as we approached the rocks, two of the men came down upon them to di&s;|pute our landing, and the re&s;t ran away. Each of the two
<PB N="493" REF="95">
champions was armed with a lance about ten feet long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Saturday 28.</NOTE> and a &s;hort &s;tick which he &s;eemed to handle as if it was a ma|chine to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in managing or throwing the lance: they called to us in a very loud tone, and in a har&s;h di&s;&s;onant lan|guage, of which neither we nor Tupia under&s;tood a &s;ingle word: they brandi&s;hed their weapons, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to defend their coa&s;t to the uttermo&s;t, though they were but two, and we were forty. I could not but admire their cou|rage, and being very unwilling that ho&s;tilities &s;hould com|mence with &s;uch inequality of force between us, I ordered the boat to lie upon her oars: we then parlied by &s;igns for about a quarter of an hour, and to be&s;peak their good-will, I threw them nails, beads, and other trifles, which they took up and &s;eemed to be well plea&s;ed with. I then made &s;igns that I wanted water, and, by all the means that I could devi&s;e, endeavoured to convince them that we would do them no harm: they now waved to us, and I was willing to inter|pret it as an invitation; but upon our putting the boat in, they came again to oppo&s;e us. One appeared to be a youth about nineteen or twenty, and the other a man of middle age: as I had now no other re&s;ource I fired a mu&s;quet be|tween them. Upon the report, the younge&s;t dropped a bundle of lances upon the rock, but recollecting him&s;elf in an in&s;tant he &s;natched them up again with great ha&s;te: a &s;tone was then thrown at us, upon which I ordered a mu&s;|quet to be fired with &s;mall &s;hot, which &s;truck the elde&s;t upon the legs, and he immediately ran to one of the hou&s;es, which was di&s;tant about an hundred yards: I now hoped that our conte&s;t was over, and we immediately landed; but we had &s;carcely left the boat when he returned, and we then per|ceived that he had left the rock only to fetch a &s;hield or tar|get for his defence. As &s;oon as he came up, he threw a lance at us, and his comrade another; they fell where we
<PB N="494" REF="96">
&s;tood thicke&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Saturday 28.</NOTE> but happily hurt nobody. A third mu&s;quet with &s;mall &s;hot was then fired at them, upon which one of them threw another lance, and both immediately ran away: if we had pur&s;ued, we might probably have taken one of them; but Mr. Banks &s;ugge&s;ting that the lances might be poi&s;oned, I thought it not prudent to venture into the woods. We repaired immediately to the huts, in one of which we found the children, who had hidden them&s;elves behind a &s;hield and &s;ome bark; we peeped at them, but left them in their retreat, without their knowing that they had been di&s;|covered, and we threw into the hou&s;e when we went away &s;ome beads, ribbons, pieces of cloth, and other pre&s;ents, which we hoped would procure us the good-will of the in|habitants when they &s;hould return; but the lances which we found lying about, we took away with us, to the number of about fifty: they were from &s;ix to fifteen feet long, and all of them had four prongs in the manner of a fi&s;h-gig, each of which was pointed with fi&s;h-bone, and very &s;harp: we ob&s;erved that they were &s;meared with a vi&s;cous &s;ub&s;tance of a green colour, which favoured the opinion of their being poi&s;oned, though we afterwards di&s;covered that it was a mi&s;|take: they appeared, by the &s;ea-weed that we found &s;ticking to them, to have been u&s;ed in &s;triking fi&s;h. Upon examining the canoes that lay upon the beach, we found them to be the wor&s;t we had ever &s;een: they were between twelve and fourteen feet long, and made of the bark of a tree in one piece, which was drawn together and tied up at each end, the middle being kept open by &s;ticks which were placed acro&s;s them from gunwale to gunwale as thwarts. We then &s;earched for fre&s;h water, but found none, except in a &s;mall hole which had been dug in the &s;and.</P>
<P>Having reimbarked in our boat, we depo&s;ited our lances on board the &s;hip, and then went over to the north point of
<PB N="495" REF="97">
the bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Saturday 28.</NOTE> where we had &s;een &s;everal of the inhabitants when we were entering it, but which we now found totally de|&s;erted. Here however we found fre&s;h water, which trickled down from the top of the rocks, and &s;tood in pools among the hollows at the bottom; but it was &s;ituated &s;o as not to be procured for our u&s;e without difficulty.</P>
<P>In the morning, therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 29.</NOTE> I &s;ent a party of men to that part of the &s;hore where we fir&s;t landed, with orders to dig holes in the &s;and where the water might gather; but going a&s;hore my&s;elf with the Gentlemen &s;oon afterwards, we found, upon a more diligent &s;earch, a &s;mall &s;tream, more than &s;ufficient for our purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon vi&s;iting the hut where we had &s;een the children, we were greatly mortified to find that the beads and ribbons which we had left there the night before, had not been moved from their places, and that not an Indian was to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Having &s;ent &s;ome empty water-ca&s;ks on &s;hore; and left a party of men to cut wood, I went my&s;elf in the pinnace to &s;ound, and examine the bay; during my excur&s;ion I &s;aw &s;e|veral of the natives, but they all fled at my approach. In one of the places where I landed I found &s;everal &s;mall fires, and fre&s;h mu&s;cles broiling upon them; here al&s;o I found &s;ome of the large&s;t oy&s;ter-&s;hells I had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the wooders and waterers came on board to din|ner, ten or twelve of the natives came down to the place, and looked with great attention and curio&s;ity at the ca&s;ks, but did not touch them: they took away however the canoes which lay near the landing-place, and again di&s;appeared. In the afternoon, when our people were again a&s;hore, &s;ix|teen or eighteen Indians, all armed, came boldly within about an hundred yards of them, and then &s;topped: two of
<PB N="496" REF="98">
them advanced &s;omewhat nearer;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Sunday 29.</NOTE> and Mr. Hicks, who com|manded the party on &s;hore, with another, advanced to meet them, holding out pre&s;ents to them as he approached, and expre&s;&s;ing kindne&s;s and amity by every &s;ign he could think of, but all without effect; for before he could get up with them they retired, and it would have an&s;wered no purpo&s;e to pur&s;ue. In the evening, I went with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander to a &s;andy cove on the north &s;ide of the bay, where, in three or four hauls with the &s;eine, we took above three hundred weight of fi&s;h, which was equally divided among the &s;hip's company.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 30.</NOTE>The next morning, before day-break, the Indians came down to the hou&s;es that were abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, and were heard frequently to &s;hout very loud. As &s;oon as it was light, they were &s;een walking along the beach; and &s;oon after they retired to the woods, where, at the di&s;tance of about a mile from the &s;hore, they kindled &s;everal fires.</P>
<P>Our people went a&s;hore as u&s;ual, and with them Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who, in &s;earch of plants, repaired to the woods. Our men, who were employed in cutting gra&s;s, being the farthe&s;t removed from the main body of the people, a company of fourteen or fifteen Indians advanced towards them, having &s;ticks in their hands, which, according to the report of the Serjeant of the marines, &s;hone like a mu&s;quet. The gra&s;s-cutters, upon &s;eeing them approach, drew together, and repaired to the main body. The Indians, being encouraged by this appearance of a flight, pur&s;ued them; they &s;topped however when they were within about a furlong of them, and after &s;houting &s;everal times went back into the woods. In the evening they came again in the &s;ame manner, &s;topped at the &s;ame di&s;tance, &s;houted and retired. I followed them my&s;elf, alone and unarmed, for a
<PB N="497" REF="99">
con&s;iderable way along the &s;hore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. April. Monday 30.</NOTE> but I could not prevail upon them to &s;top.</P>
<P>This day Mr. Green took the &s;un's meridian altitude a little within the &s;outh entrance of the bay, which gave the lati|tude 34&deg; S. the variation of the needle was 11&deg; 3&prime; E.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, the body of Forby Sutherland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May. Tue&s;day 1.</NOTE> one of our &s;eamen, who died the evening before, was buried near the watering-place; and from this incident I called the &s;outh point of this bay SUTHERLAND POINT. This day we re&s;olved to make an excur&s;ion into the country. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, my&s;elf, and &s;even others, properly accoutred for the expedition, &s;et out, and repaired fir&s;t to the huts, near the watering-place, whither &s;ome of the natives conti|nued every day to re&s;ort; and though the little pre&s;ents which we had left there before had not yet been taken away, we left others of &s;omewhat more value, con&s;i&s;ting of cloth, looking-gla&s;&s;es, combs, and beads, and then went up into the country. We found the &s;oil to be either &s;wamp or light &s;and, and the face of the country finely diver&s;ified by wood and lawn. The trees are tall, &s;trait, and without under|wood, &s;tanding at &s;uch a di&s;tance from each other that the whole country, at lea&s;t where the &s;wamps do not render it incapable of cultivation, might be cultivated without cut|ting down one of them: between the trees the ground is covered with gra&s;s, of which there is great abundance, growing in tufts about as big as can well be gra&s;ped in the hand, which &s;tand very clo&s;e to each other. We &s;aw many hou&s;es of the inhabitants, and places where they had &s;lept upon the gra&s;s without any &s;helter; but we &s;aw only one of the people, who the moment he di&s;covered us ran away. At all the&s;e places we left pre&s;ents, hoping that at length they might produce confidence and good-will. We
<PB N="498" REF="100">
had a tran&s;ient and imperfect view of a quadruped about as big as a rabbit:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Tue&s;day 1.</NOTE> Mr. Banks's greyhound, which was with us, got &s;ight of it, and would probably have caught it, but the moment he &s;et off he lamed him&s;elf, again&s;t a &s;tump which lay concealed in the long gra&s;s. We afterwards &s;aw the dung of an animal which fed upon gra&s;s, and which we judged could not be le&s;s than a deer; and the foot&s;teps of another, which was clawed like a dog, and &s;eemed to be about as big as a wolf: we al&s;o tracked a &s;mall animal, who&s;e foot re&s;embled that of a polcat or wea&s;el. The trees over our head abounded with birds of various kinds, among which were many of exqui&s;ite beauty, particularly loriquets and cockatoos, which flew in flocks of &s;everal &s;cores toge|ther. We found &s;ome wood which had been felled by the natives with a blunt in&s;trument, and &s;ome that had been barked. The trees were not of many &s;pecies; among others there was a large one which yielded a gum not unlike the <HI>Sanguis draconis</HI>; and in &s;ome of them &s;teps had been cut at about three feet di&s;tance from each other, for the conveni|ence of climbing them.</P>
<P>From this excur&s;ion we returned between three and four o'clock, and having dined on board, we went a&s;hore again at the waterring-place, where a party of men were filling ca&s;ks. Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, had been &s;ent out in the morning with a boat to dredge for oy&s;ters at the head of the bay; when he had performed this &s;ervice, he went a&s;hore, and having taken a mid&s;hipman with him, and &s;ent the boat away, &s;et out to join the waterers by land. In his way he fell in with a body of two and twenty Indians, who followed him, and were often not more than twenty yards di&s;tant; when Mr. Gore perceived them &s;o near, he &s;topped, and faced about, upon which they &s;topped al&s;o; and when he went
<PB N="499" REF="101">
on again, continued their pur&s;uit:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Tue&s;day 1.</NOTE> they did not however attack him, though they were all armed with lances, and he and the mid&s;hipman got in &s;afety to the watering-place. The Indians, who had &s;lackened their pur&s;uit when they came in &s;ight of the main body of our people, halted at about the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile, where they &s;tood &s;till. Mr. Monkhou&s;e and two or three of the waterers took it in their head to march up to them; but &s;eeing the Indians keep their ground till they came pretty near them, they were &s;eized with a &s;udden fear very common to the ra&s;h and fool-hardy, and made a ha&s;ty retreat: this &s;tep, which in|&s;ured the danger that it was taken to avoid, encouraged the Indians, and four of them running forward di&s;charged their lances at the fugitives, with &s;uch force that, flying no le&s;s than forty yards, they went beyond them. As the Indians did not pur&s;ue, our people, recovering their &s;pirits, &s;topped to collect the lances when they came up to the place where they lay; upon which the Indians, in their turn, began to retire. Ju&s;t at this time I came up, with Mr. Banks, Dr. So|lander, and Tupia; and being de&s;irous to convince the In|dians that we were neither afraid of them, nor intended them any mi&s;chief, we advanced towards them, making &s;igns of expo&s;tulation and entreaty, but they could not be per&s;uaded to wait till we could come up. Mr. Gore told us, that he had &s;een &s;ome of them up the bay, who had invited him by &s;igns to come on &s;hore, which he, certainly with great prudence, declined.</P>
<P>The morning of the next day was &s;o rainy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 2.</NOTE> that we were all glad to &s;tay on board. In the afternoon, however, it cleared up, and we made another excur&s;ion along the &s;ea-coa&s;t to the &s;outhward: we went a&s;hore, and Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander gathered many plants; but be&s;ides the&s;e we &s;aw nothing worthy of notice. At our fir&s;t entering the
<PB N="500" REF="102">
woods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Wedne&s;. 2.</NOTE> we met with three of the natives, who in&s;tantly ran away: more of them were &s;een by &s;ome of the people, but they all di&s;appeared, with great precipitation, as &s;oon as they found that they were di&s;covered. By the boldne&s;s of the&s;e people at our fir&s;t landing, and the terror that &s;eized them at the &s;ight of us afterwards, it appears that they were &s;uffi|ciently intimidated by our fire-arms: not that we had any rea&s;on to think the people much hurt by the &s;mall-&s;hot which we were obliged to fire at them, when they attacked us at our coming out of the boat; but they had probably &s;een the effects of them, from their lurking places, upon the birds that we had &s;hot. Tupia, who was now become a good mark&s;man, frequently &s;trayed from us to &s;hoot par|rots; and he had told us, that while he was thus employed, he had once met with nine Indians, who, as &s;oon as they perceived he &s;aw them, ran from him, in great confu&s;ion and terror.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 3.</NOTE>The next day, twelve canoes, in each of which was a &s;ingle Indian, came towards the watering-place, and were within half a mile of it a con&s;iderable time: they were employed in &s;triking fi&s;h, upon which, like others that we had &s;een be|fore, they were &s;o intent that they &s;eemed to regard nothing el&s;e. It happened, however, that a party of our people were out a &s;hooting near the place, and one of the men, who&s;e curio&s;ity might at length perhaps be rou&s;ed by the report of the fowling-pieces, was ob&s;erved by Mr. Banks to haul up his canoe upon the beach, and go towards the &s;hooting party: in &s;omething more than a quarter of an hour he re|turned, launched his canoe, and went off in her to his com|panions. This incident makes it probable that the natives acquired a knowlege of the de&s;tructive power of our fire|arms, when we knew nothing of the matter; for this man
<PB N="501" REF="103">
was not &s;een by any of the party who&s;e operations he had reconnoitred.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Thur&s;day 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>While Mr. Banks was gathering plants near the watering-place, I went with Dr. Solander and Mr. Monkhou&s;e to the head of the bay, that I might examine that part of the coun|try, and make farther attempts to form &s;ome connection with the natives. In our way we met with eleven or twelve &s;mall canoes, with each a man in it, probably the &s;ame that were afterwards abrea&s;t of the &s;hore, who all made into &s;hoal water upon our approach. We met other Indians on &s;hore the fir&s;t time we landed, who in&s;tantly took to their canoes, and paddled away. We went up the country to &s;ome di&s;tance, and found the face of it nearly the &s;ame with that which has been de&s;cribed already, but the &s;oil was much richer; for in&s;tead of &s;and, I found a deep black mould, which I thought very fit for the production of grain of any kind. In the woods we found a tree which bore fruit that in colour and &s;hape re&s;embled a cherry; the juice had an agreeable tartne&s;s, though but little flavour. We found al&s;o in|ter&s;per&s;ed &s;ome of the fine&s;t meadows in the world: &s;ome places however were rocky, but the&s;e were comparatively few: the &s;tone is &s;andy, and might be u&s;ed with advantage for build|ing. When we returned to the boat, we &s;aw &s;ome &s;moke upon another part of the coa&s;t, and went thither in hopes of meeting with the people, but at our approach, the&s;e al&s;o ran away. We found &s;ix &s;mall canoes, and &s;ix fires very near the beach, with &s;ome mu&s;cles roa&s;ting upon them, and a few oy&s;ters lying near: by this we judged that there had been one man in each canoe, who having picked up &s;ome &s;hell-fi&s;h were come a&s;hore to eat it, and that each had made his &s;eparate fire for that purpo&s;e; we ta&s;ted of their cheer, and left them in return &s;ome &s;trings of beads, and other things

Thur&s;day 3.</NOTE> At the foot of a tree in this place we found a &s;mall well of fre&s;h water, &s;upplied by a &s;pring; and the day being now far &s;pent, we returned to the &s;hip. In the evening, Mr. Banks made a little excur|&s;ion with his gun, and found &s;uch a number of quails, re|&s;embling tho&s;e in England, that he might have &s;hot as many as he plea&s;ed; but his object was variety, and not number.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 4.</NOTE>The next morning, as the wind would not permit me to &s;ail, I &s;ent out &s;everal parties into the country to try again whether &s;ome intercour&s;e could not be e&s;tabli&s;hed with the natives. A mid&s;hipman who belonged to one of the&s;e par|ties, having &s;traggled a long way from his companions, met with a very old man and woman, and &s;ome little children; they were &s;itting under a tree by the water &s;ide, and neither party &s;aw the other till they were clo&s;e together: the Indians &s;howed &s;igns of fear, but did not attempt to run away. The man happened to have nothing to give them but a parrot that he had &s;hot; this he offered, but they refu&s;ed to accept it, withdrawing them&s;elves from his hand either through fear or aver&s;ion. His &s;tay with them was but &s;hort, for he &s;aw &s;everal canoes near the beach fi&s;hing, and being alone, he feared they might come a&s;hore and attack him: he &s;aid, that the&s;e people were very dark coloured, but not black; that the man and woman appeared to be very old, being both grey-headed; that the hair of the man's head was bu&s;hy, and his beard long and rough; that the woman's hair was cropped &s;hort, and both of them were &s;tark naked. Mr. Monkhou&s;e the Surgeon, and one of the men, who were with another party near the watering-place, al&s;o &s;tayed from their companions, and as they were coming out of a thicket ob&s;erved &s;ix Indians &s;tanding together, at the di&s;tance of about fifty yards. One of them pronounced a word very

loud, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;ignal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Friday 4.</NOTE> for a lance was immediately thrown at him out of the wood, which very narrowly mi&s;&s;ed him. When the Indians &s;aw that the wea|pon had not taken effect, they ran away with the greate&s;t precipitation; but on turning about towards the place whence the lance had been thrown, he &s;aw a young Indian, whom he judged to be about nineteen or twenty years old, come down from a tree, and he al&s;o ran away with &s;uch &s;peed as made it hopele&s;s to follow him. Mr. Monkhou&s;e was of opinion that he had been watched by the&s;e Indians in his pa&s;&s;age through the thicket, and that the youth had been &s;tationed in the tree, to di&s;charge the lance at him, upon a &s;ignal as he &s;hould come by; but however this be, there could be no doubt but that he was the per&s;on who threw the lance.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, I went my&s;elf with a party over to the north &s;hore, and while &s;ome of our people were hauling the &s;eine, we made an excur&s;ion a few miles into the country, proceeding afterwards in the direction of the coa&s;t. We found this place without wood, and &s;omewhat re&s;embling our moors in England; the &s;urface of the ground, however, was covered with a thin bru&s;h of plants, about as high as the knees: the hills near the coa&s;t are low, but others ri&s;e behind them, increa&s;ing by a gradual a&s;cent to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, with mar&s;hes and mora&s;&s;es between. When we returned to the boat, we found that our people had caught with the &s;eine a great number of &s;mall fi&s;h, which are well known in the We&s;t Indies, and which our &s;ailors call Leather jackets, becau&s;e their &s;kin is remarkably thick. I had &s;ent the Second Lieutenant out in the yawl a &s;triking, and when we got back to the &s;hip, we found that he al&s;o had been very &s;ucce&s;sful. He had ob&s;erved that the large &s;ting-rays, of
<PB N="504" REF="106">
which there is great plenty in the bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Friday 4.</NOTE> followed the flowing tide into very &s;hallow water; he therefore took the opportu|nity of flood, and &s;truck &s;everal in not more than two or three feet water: one of them weighed no le&s;s than two hundred and forty pounds after his entrails were taken out.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 5.</NOTE>The next morning, as the wind &s;till continued northerly I &s;ent out the yawl again, and the people &s;truck one &s;till larger, for when his entrails were taken out he weighed three hundred and thirty-&s;ix pounds.</P>
<P>The great quantity of plants which Mr. Banks and Dr. So|lander collected in this place induced me to give it the name of BOTANY BAY. It is &s;ituated in the latitude of 34&deg; S., lon|gitude 208&deg; 37&prime; W. It is capacious, &s;afe, and convenient, and may be known by the land on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, which is nearly level, and of a moderate height; in general higher than it is farther inland, with &s;teep rocky cliffs next the &s;ea, which have the appearance of a long i&s;land lying clo&s;e under the &s;hore. The harbour lies about the middle of this land, and in approaching it from the &s;outhward, is di&s;covered before the &s;hip comes abrea&s;t of it; but from the northward it is not di&s;covered &s;o &s;oon: the entrance is a little more than a quarter of a mile broad, and lies in W.N.W. To &s;ail into it the &s;outhern &s;hore &s;hould be kept on board, till the &s;hip is within a &s;mall bare i&s;land, which lies clo&s;e under the north &s;hore; within this i&s;land the deepe&s;t water on that &s;ide is &s;even fathom, &s;hallowing to five a good way up. At a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;outh &s;hore there is a &s;hoal, reach|ing from the inner &s;outh point quite to the head of the har|bour; but over towards the north and north we&s;t &s;hore there is a channel of twelve or fourteen feet at low water, for three or four leagues, up to a place where there is three or four fathom, but here I found very little fre&s;h water. We
<PB N="505" REF="107">
anchored near the &s;outh &s;hore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Saturday 5.</NOTE> about a mile within the en|trance, for the convenience of &s;ailing with a &s;outherly wind, and becau&s;e I thought it the be&s;t &s;ituation for watering; but I afterwards found a very fine &s;tream on the north &s;hore, in the fir&s;t &s;andy cove within the i&s;land, before which a &s;hip might lie almo&s;t land-locked, and procure wood as well as water in great abundance. Wood indeed is every where plenty, but I &s;aw only two kinds which may be con&s;idered as timber. The&s;e trees are as large, or larger than the Engli&s;h oak, and one of them has not a very different appearance: this is the &s;ame that yields the reddi&s;h gum like <HI>&s;anguis draconis,</HI> and the wood is heavy, hard, and dark-coloured, like <HI>lignum vitae:</HI> the other grows tall and &s;trait, &s;omething like the pine; and the wood of this, which has &s;ome re&s;emblance to the live oak of America, is al&s;o hard and heavy. There are a few &s;hrubs, and &s;everal kinds of the palm; mangroves al&s;o grow in great plenty near the head of the bay. The country in general is level, low, and woody, as far as we could &s;ee. The woods, as I have before ob&s;erved, abound with birds of exqui&s;ite beauty, particularly of the parrot kind; we found al&s;o crows here, exactly the &s;ame with tho&s;e in England. About the head of the harbour, where there are large flats of &s;and and mud, there is great plenty of water-fowl, mo&s;t of which were altogether unknown to us: one of the mo&s;t remarkable was black and white, much larger than a &s;wan, and in &s;hape &s;omewhat re&s;embling a pe|lican. On the&s;e banks of &s;and and mud there are great quan|tities of oy&s;ters, mu&s;cles, cockles, and other &s;hell-fi&s;h, which &s;eem to be the principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the inhabitants, who go into &s;hoal water with their little canoes, and pick them out with their hands. We did not ob&s;erve that they eat any of them raw, nor do they always go on &s;hore to dre&s;s them, for they have frequently fires in their canoes for that pur|po&s;e.
<PB N="506" REF="108">
They do not however &s;ub&s;i&s;t wholly upon this food,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Saturday 5.</NOTE> for they catch a variety of other fi&s;h, &s;ome of which they &s;trike with gigs, and &s;ome they take with hook and line. All the inhabitants that we &s;aw were &s;tark naked: they did not appear to be numerous, nor to live in &s;ocieties, but like other animals were &s;cattered about along the coa&s;t, and in the woods. Of their manner of life, however, we could know but little, as we were never able to form the lea&s;t con|nection with them: after the fir&s;t conte&s;t at our landing, they would never come near enough to parley; nor did they touch a &s;ingle article of all that we had left at their huts, and the places they frequented, on purpo&s;e for them to take away.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay in this harbour, I cau&s;ed the Engli&s;h co|lours to be di&s;played on &s;hore every day, and the &s;hip's name, and the date of the year, to be in&s;cribed upon one of the trees near the watering-place.</P>
<P>It is high-water here at the full and change of the moon about eight o'clock, and the tide ri&s;es and falls perpendicu|larly between four and five feet.</P>

<P>AT day-break, on Sunday the 6th of May 1770,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Sunday 6.</NOTE> we &s;et &s;ail from Botany Bay, with a light breeze at N. W. which &s;oon after coming to the &s;outhward, we &s;teered along the &s;hore N. N. E.; and at noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 33&deg; 50&prime; S. At this time we were between two and three miles di&s;tant from the land, and a-brea&s;t of a bay, or har|bour, in which there appeared to be good anchorage, and which I called PORT JACKSON. This harbour lies three leagues to the northward of Botany Bay: the variation, by &s;everal azimuths, appeared to be 8&deg; E. At &s;un-&s;et, the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. 26 E. and &s;ome broken land, that &s;eemed to form a bay, bore N. 40 W. di&s;tant four leagues. This bay, which lies in latitude 33&deg; 42&prime;, I called BROKEN BAY. We &s;teered along the &s;hore N. N. E. all night, at the di&s;tance of about three leagues from the land, having from thirty-two to thirty-&s;ix fathom water, with a hard &s;andy bottom.</P>

In the afternoon, we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places upon the &s;hore, and in the evening, found the variation to be 8&deg; 25&prime; E. At this time we were between two and three miles from the &s;hore, in twenty-eight fathom; and at noon the next day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 8.</NOTE> we had not advanced one &s;tep to the northward. We &s;tood off &s;hore, with the winds north|erly, till twelve at night, and at the di&s;tance of about five leagues, had &s;eventy fathom; at the di&s;tance of &s;ix leagues we had eighty fathom, which is the extent of the &s;ound|ings; for at the di&s;tance of ten leagues, we had no ground with 150 fathom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 10.</NOTE>The wind continuing northerly, till the morning of the 10th, we continued to &s;tand in and off the &s;hore, with very little change of &s;ituation in other re&s;pects; but a gale then &s;pringing up at S. W. we made the be&s;t of our way along the &s;hore to the northward. At &s;un-ri&s;e, our latitude was 33&deg; 2&prime; S. and the variation 8&deg; E. At nine in the forenoon, we pa&s;&s;ed a remarkable hill, which &s;tood a little way inland, and &s;ome|what re&s;embled the crown of a hat: and at noon, our lati|tude, by ob&s;ervation, was 32&deg; 53&prime; S. and our longitude 208&deg; W. We were about two leagues di&s;tant from the land, which extended from N. 41 E. to S. 41 W., and a &s;mall round rock, or i&s;land, which lay clo&s;e under the land, bore S. 82 W. di&s;tant between three and four leagues. At four in the afternoon, we pa&s;&s;ed, at the di&s;tance of about a mile, a low rocky point, which I called POINT STEPHENS, on the north &s;ide of which is an inlet, which I called PORT STEPHENS: this inlet appeared to me, from the ma&s;t head, to be &s;hel|tered from all winds. It lies in latitude 32&deg; 40&prime;, longitude 207&deg; 51&prime;, and at the entrance are three &s;mall i&s;lands, two of which are high; and on the main near the &s;hore are &s;ome high round hills, which at a di&s;tance appear like i&s;lands.

pa&s;&s;ing this bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May.

At a little di&s;tance within land, we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places; and at half an hour pa&s;t five, the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. 36 E. and Point Stephens S.

Our &s;ound|ings in the night, were from forty-eight to &s;ixty-two fathom, at the di&s;tance of between three and four leagues from the &s;hore, which made in two hillocks. This Point I called CAPE HAWKE: it lies in the latitude of 32&deg; 14&prime; S., longitude 207&deg; 30&prime; W.;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 11.</NOTE> and at four o'clock in the morning bore W. di&s;tant about eight miles; at the &s;ame time the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. 6 E. and appeared like an i&s;land. At noon, this land bore N. 8 E. the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight N. 13 E. and Cape Hawke S. 37 W. Our latitude, by ob&s;er|vation, was 32&deg; 2&prime; S. which was twelve miles to the &s;outh|ward of that given by the log; &s;o that probably we had a current &s;etting that way: by the morning amplitude and azimuth, the variation was 9&deg; 10&prime; E. During our run along the &s;hore, in the afternoon, we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places, at a little di&s;tance from the beach, and one upon the top of a hill, which was the fir&s;t we had &s;een upon elevated ground &s;ince our arrival upon the coa&s;t. At &s;un-&s;et, we had twenty-three fathom, at the di&s;tance of a league and an half from the &s;hore: the northermo&s;t land then bore N. 13 E. and three hills, remarkably large and high, lying contiguous to each other, and not far from the beach, N. N. W. As the&s;e hills bore &s;ome re&s;emblance to each other, we called them the THREE BROTHERS. They lie in latitude 31&deg; 40&prime;, and may be &s;een fourteen or &s;ixteen leagues. We &s;teered N. E. by N. all night, having from twenty-&s;even to &s;ixty-&s;even fathom, at the di&s;tance of between two and &s;ix leagues from the &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="510" REF="112"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Saturday 12.</NOTE>At day-break, we &s;teered north, for the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight.

At noon, we were about four leagues from the &s;hore, and by ob&s;er|vation, in latitude 30&deg; 22&prime;, which was nine miles to the &s;outhward of our reckoning, longitude 206&deg; 39&prime; W. Some lands near the &s;hore, of a con&s;iderable height, bore W.</P>
<P>As we advanced to the northward, from Botany Bay, the land gradually increa&s;ed in height, &s;o that in this latitude it may be called a hilly country. Between this latitude and the Bay, it exhibits a plea&s;ing variety of ridges, hills, vallies, and plains, all clothed with wood, of the &s;ame appearance with that which has been particularly de&s;cribed: the land near the &s;hore is in general low and &s;andy, except the points, which are rocky, and over many of them are high hills, which, at their fir&s;t ri&s;ing out of the water, have the appear|ance of i&s;lands. In the afternoon, we had &s;ome &s;mall rocky i&s;lands between us and the land, the &s;outhermo&s;t of which lies in latitude 30&deg; 10&prime;, and the northermo&s;t in 29&deg; 58&prime;, and &s;omewhat more than two leagues from the land: about two miles without the northermo&s;t i&s;land we had thirty-three fa|thom water, Having the advantage of a moon, we &s;teered along the &s;hore all night, in the direction of N. and N. by E. keeping at the di&s;tance of about three leagues from the land, and having from twenty to twenty-five fathom water. As &s;oon as it was light, having a fre&s;h gale, we made all the fail we could, and at nine o'clock in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 15.</NOTE> being about a league from the &s;hore, we di&s;covered &s;moke in many places, and having recour&s;e to our gla&s;&s;es, we &s;aw about twenty of the natives, who had each a large bundle

At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 28&deg; 39&prime; S., and longitude 206&deg; 27&prime;W. A high point of land, which I named CAPE BYRON, bore N. W. by W. at the di&s;tance of three miles. It lies in latitude 28&deg; 37&prime; 30&Prime; S., longitude 206&deg; 30&prime; W. and may be known by a remarkable &s;harp peaked mountain, which lies inland, and bears from it N. W. by W. From this point, the land trends N. 13 W.: inland it is high and hilly, but low near the &s;hore; to the &s;outhward of the point it is al&s;o low and level. We continued to &s;teer along the &s;hore with a fre&s;h gale, till &s;un-&s;et, when we &s;uddenly di&s;covered breakers a-head, directly in the &s;hip's cour&s;e, and al&s;o on our larboard bow. At this time we were about five miles from the land, and had twenty fathom water: we hauled up ea&s;t till eight, when we had run eight miles, and increa&s;ed our depth of water to forty-four fathom: we then brought to, with the &s;hip's head to the ea&s;tward, and lay upon this tack till ten, when, having increa&s;ed our &s;ounding to &s;eventy-eight fathom, we wore, and lay with the &s;hip's head to the land till five in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 16.</NOTE> when we made &s;ail, and at daylight, were greatly &s;urprized to find our&s;elves farther to the &s;outhward, than we had been the evening before,

They lie in latitude 28&deg; 8&prime; S. &s;tretching off ea&s;t two leagues from a point of land, under which is a &s;mall i&s;land. Their &s;ituation may always be known by the peaked mountain which has been ju&s;t mentioned, and which bears from them S. W. by W. for this rea&s;on I have named it MOUNT WARNING. It lies &s;even or eight leagues inland, in latitude 28&deg; 22&prime; S. The land about it is high and hilly, but it is of it&s;elf &s;ufficiently con&s;picuous to be at once di&s;tingui&s;hed from every other object. The Point off which the&s;e &s;hoals lie, I have named POINT DANGER. To the northward of this Point the land is low, and trends N. W. by N.; but it &s;oon turns again more to the northward.</P>
<P>At noon, we were about two leagues from the land, and by ob&s;ervation, in latitude 27&deg; 46&prime; S. which was &s;eventeen miles to the &s;outhward of the log; our longitude was 206&deg; 20&prime; W. Mount Warning bore S. 26 W. di&s;tant fourteen leagues, and the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. We pur&s;ued our cour&s;e along the &s;hore, at the di&s;tance of about two leagues, in the direction of N. &frac34; E. till between four and five in the afternoon, when we di&s;covered breakers on our larboard bow. Our depth of water was thirty-&s;even fathom, and at &s;un-&s;et, the northermo&s;t land bore N. by W. the breakers N.

On the north &s;ide of this Point, the &s;hore forms a wide open bay, which I called MORETON's BAY, in the bottom of which the land is &s;o low that I could but ju&s;t &s;ee it from the top-ma&s;t head.

E.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 17.</NOTE> At four in the morning, we had 135 fathom, and when the day broke, I perceived that during the night I had got much farther northward, and from the &s;hore, than I expected from the cour&s;e we &s;teered, for we were di&s;tant at lea&s;t &s;even leagues; I therefore hauled in N. W. by W. with a fre&s;h gale at S. S. W. The land that was farthe&s;t to the north the night before, now bore S. S. W. di&s;tant &s;ix leagues, and I gave it the name of CAPE MORE|TON, it being the north point of Moreton's Bay: its latitude is 26&deg; 56&prime;, and its longitude is 206&deg; 28&prime;. From Cape Moreton the land trends away we&s;t, farther than can be &s;een, for there is a &s;mall &s;pace, where at this time no land is vi&s;ible, and &s;ome on board having al&s;o ob&s;erved that the &s;ea looked paler than u&s;ual, were of opinion that the bottom of More|ton's Bay opened into a river: we had here thirty-four fa|thom water, and a fine &s;andy bottom: this alone would have produced the change that had been ob&s;erved in the colour of the water; and it was by no means nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e a river to account for the land at the bottom of the Bay not being vi&s;ible, for &s;uppo&s;ing the land there to be as low as we knew it to be in a hundred other parts of the coa&s;t, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee it from the &s;tation of the &s;hip; however, if any future navigator &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to de|termine the que&s;tion, whether there is or is not a river in this place, which the wind would not permit us to do, the &s;ituation may always be found by three hills which lie to the northward of it, in the latitude of 26&deg; 53&prime;. The&s;e hills lie but a little way inland, and not far from each other: they are remarkable for the &s;ingular form of their elevation,

This part of the coa&s;t, which is of a moderate height, is more barren than any we had &s;een, and the &s;oil more &s;andy. With our gla&s;&s;es we could di&s;cover that the &s;ands, which lay in great patches of many acres, were moveable, and that &s;ome of them had not been long in the place they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; for we &s;aw in &s;everal parts, trees half buried, the tops of which were &s;till green; and in others, the naked trunks of &s;uch as the &s;and had &s;urrounded long enough to de&s;troy. In other places the woods appeared to be low and &s;hrubby, and we &s;aw no &s;igns of inhabitants. Two water &s;nakes &s;wam by the &s;hip: they were beautifully &s;potted, and in every re&s;pect like land &s;nakes, except that their tails were broad and flat, probably to &s;erve them in&s;tead of fins in &s;wimming. In the morning of this day, the vari|ation was 8&deg; 20&prime; E. and in the evening, 8&deg; 36&prime;.

We kept to the northward all night, at the di&s;tance of from four miles to four leagues from the &s;hore, and with a depth of water from &s;eventeen to thirty-four fathom. At day-break,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 20.</NOTE> the northermo&s;t land bore from us W. S. W. and &s;eemed to end in a point, from which we di&s;covered a reef running out to the northward as far as we could &s;ee. We had hauled our wind to the we&s;tward before it was light, and continued the cour&s;e till we &s;aw the breakers upon our &s;ee bow. We now edged away N. W. and N. N. W. along the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;hoal, from two to one mile di&s;tant, having regular &s;oundings from thirteen to &s;even fathom, with a fine &s;andy bottom. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 20&deg; 26&prime;, which was thirteen miles to the northward of the log: we judged the extream point of the &s;hoal to bear from us about N. W. and the point from which it &s;eemed to run out, bore S. &frac34; W. di&s;tant twenty miles. This point I named SANDY CAPE, from two very large patches of white &s;and which lay upon it. It is &s;ufficiently high to be &s;een at the di&s;tance of twelve leagues, in clear weather, and lies in latitude 24&deg; 45&prime;, longitude 206&deg; 51&prime;: the land trends from it S. W. as far as can be &s;een. We kept along the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;hoal till two in the afternoon, when, judging that there was a &s;ufficient depth of water upon it to allow pa&s;&s;age for the &s;hip, I &s;ent the boat a-head to &s;ound, and upon her making the &s;ignal for more than five fathom, we hauled our wind, and &s;tood over the tail of it in &s;ix fathom. At this time we were in la|titude 24&deg; 22&prime;, and Sandy Cape bore S. &frac12; E. di&s;tant eight leagues; but the direction of the &s;hoal is neare&s;t N. N. W.

This &s;hoal I called the BREAK SEA SPIT, becau&s;e we had now &s;mooth water, and to the &s;outhward of it we had always a high &s;ea from the S. E. At &s;ix in the evening, the land of Sandy Cape extended from S. 17 E. to S. 27 E. at the di&s;tance of eight leagues; our depth of water was twenty-three fathom: with the &s;ame &s;oundings we &s;tood to the we&s;t|ward all night.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 21.</NOTE> At &s;even in the morning, we &s;aw, from the ma&s;t-head, the land of Sandy Cape bearing S.

Our depth of water was now decrea&s;ed to &s;eventeen fathom, and by noon we had no more than thirteen, though we were &s;even leagues from the land, which extended from S. by W. to W. N. W. Our latitude at this time was 24&deg; 28&prime;S. For a few days pa&s;t we had &s;een &s;everal of the &s;ea birds called boo|bies, not having met with any of them before; la&s;t night a &s;mall flock of them pa&s;&s;ed the &s;hip, and went away to the N. W. and in the morning, from about half an hour before &s;un-ri&s;e, to half an hour after, flights of them were con|tinually coming from the N. N. W. and flying to the S. S. E. nor was one of them &s;een to fly in any other direction; we therefore conjectured that there was a lagoon, river, or inlet of &s;hallow water, in the bottom of the deep bay, to the &s;outhward of us, whither the&s;e birds re&s;orted to feed in the day, and that not far to the northward there were &s;ome i&s;lands to which they repaired in the night. To this bay I gave the name of HERVEY's BAY, in honour of Captain Hervey.

In the afternoon, we &s;tood in for the land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Monday 21.</NOTE> &s;teering S. W. with a gentle breeze at S.

wind blew fre&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Wedne&s;. 23.</NOTE> and we found it &s;o cold, that being at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;hore, we took our cloaks as a nece&s;&s;ary equipment for the voyage. We landed a little within the &s;outh point of the bay, where we found a channel leading into a large lagoon: this channel I proceeded to examine, and found three fathom water till I got about a mile up it, where I met with a &s;hoal, upon which there was little more than one fathom, but having pa&s;&s;ed over it, I had three fa|thom again. The entrance of this channel lies clo&s;e to the &s;outh point of the bay, being formed by the &s;hore on the ea&s;t, and on the we&s;t by a large &s;pit of &s;and: it is about a quarter of a mile broad, and lies in S. by W. In this place there is room for a few &s;hips to lie in great &s;ecurity, and a &s;mall &s;tream of fre&s;h water; I would have rowed into the lagoon, but was prevented by &s;hallows. We found &s;everal bogs, and &s;wamps of &s;alt water, upon which, and by the &s;ides of the lagoon, grows the true mangrove, &s;uch as is found in the We&s;t Indies, and the fir&s;t of the kind that we had met with. In the branches of the&s;e mangroves there were many ne&s;ts of a remarkable kind of ant, that was as green as gra&s;s: when the branches were di&s;turbed they came out in great numbers, and puni&s;hed the offender by a much &s;harper bite than ever we had felt from the &s;ame kind of animal before. Upon the&s;e mangroves al&s;o we &s;aw &s;mall green caterpillars in great numbers: their bodies were thick &s;et with hairs, and they were ranged upon the leaves &s;ide by &s;ide like a file of &s;oldiers, to the number of twenty or thirty together: when we touched them, we found that the hair on their bodies had the quality of a nettle, and gave us a much more acute, though le&s;s durable pain. The country here is manife&s;tly wor&s;e than about Botany Bay: the &s;oil is dry and &s;andy, but the &s;ides of the hills are covered with trees, which grow &s;eparately, without underwood. We
<PB N="521" REF="123">
found here the tree that yields a gum like the <HI>Sanguis draco|nis;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Wedne&s;. 23.</NOTE> but it is &s;omewhat different from the trees of the &s;ame kind which we had &s;een before, for the leaves are longer, and hang down like tho&s;e of the weeping willow. We found al&s;o much le&s;s gum upon them, which is contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion, that the hotter the climate, the more gums exude. Upon a plant al&s;o, which yielded a yellow gum, there was le&s;s than upon the &s;ame kind of plant in Botany Bay. Among the &s;hoals and &s;and-banks we &s;aw many large birds, &s;ome in particular of the &s;ame kind that we had &s;een in Botany Bay, much bigger than &s;wans, which we judged to be pelicans; but they were &s;o &s;hy that we could not get within gun-&s;hot of them. Upon the &s;hore we &s;aw a &s;pecies of the bu&s;tard, one of which we &s;hot, it was as large as a turkey, and weighed &s;eventeen pounds and an half. We all agreed that this was the be&s;t bird we had eaten &s;ince we left England; and in honour of it we called this inlet BUSTARD BAY. It lies in latitude 24&deg; 4&prime;, longitude 208&deg; 18&prime;. The &s;ea &s;eemed to abound with fi&s;h; but, unhap|pily, we tore our &s;eine all to pieces at the fir&s;t haul: upon the mud-banks, under the mangroves, we found innume|rable oy&s;ters of various kinds; among others the hammer-oy&s;ter, and a large proportion of &s;mall pearl-oy&s;ters: if in deeper water there is equal plenty of &s;uch oy&s;ters at their full growth, a pearl fi&s;hery might certainly be e&s;tabli&s;hed here to very great advantage.</P>
<P>The people who were left on board the &s;hip &s;aid, that while we were in the woods about twenty of the natives came down to the beach, abrea&s;t of her, and having looked at her &s;ometime, went away; but we that were a&s;hore, though we &s;aw &s;moke in many places, &s;aw no people: the &s;moke was at places too di&s;tant for us to get to them by land, except one,

to which we repaired:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May.

The whole was in a thicket of clo&s;e trees, which afforded good &s;helter from the wind. The place &s;eemed to be much trodden, and as we &s;aw no hou&s;e, nor any remains of a hou&s;e, we were inclined to believe that as the&s;e people had no clothes, they had no dwelling; but &s;pent their nights, among the other commoners of Nature, in the open air: and Tupia him&s;elf, with an air of &s;uperiority and compa&s;&s;ion, &s;hook his head, and &s;aid that they were <HI>Taata Enos,</HI> 'poor wretches.'

Soon after we &s;aw more land, making like i&s;lands, and bear|ing N. W. by N. At nine, we were abrea&s;t of the point, at the di&s;tance of one mile, with fourteen fathom water. This point I found to lie directly under the Tropic of Capricorn; and for that rea&s;on I called it CAPE CAPRICORN: its longitude is 208&deg; 58&prime; W.: it is of a con&s;iderable height, looks white and barren, and may be known by &s;ome i&s;lands which lie to the N.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 26.</NOTE>At &s;ix in the morning we weighed, with a gentle breeze at South, and &s;tood away to the N.

At noon we were about three miles from the main, and about the &s;ame di&s;tance from the i&s;lands without us: our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 23&deg; 7&prime; S.: the main land here is high and mountainous; the i&s;lands which lie off it are al&s;o mo&s;t of them high, and of a &s;mall circuit, having an appearance rather of barrenne&s;s than fertility. At this time we &s;aw &s;moke in many places at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance inland, and therefore conjectured that there might be a lagoon, river, or inlet running up the country, the rather as we had pa&s;&s;ed two places which had the appearance of being &s;uch; but our depth of water was too little to encourage me to venture where I &s;hould probably have le&s;s. We had not &s;tood to the northward above an hour, before we &s;uddenly fell into three fathom; upon which I anchored, and &s;ent away the Ma&s;ter to found the channel which lay to leeward of us, between the northermo&s;t i&s;land and the main: it appeared to be pretty broad, but I &s;u&s;pected that it was &s;hallow, and &s;o in|deed it was found; for the ma&s;ter reported at his return that in many places he had only two fathom and an
<PB N="525" REF="127">
half, and where we lay at anchor we had only &s;ixteen feet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Saturday 26.</NOTE> which was not two feet more than the &s;hip drew. While the ma&s;ter was &s;ounding the channel, Mr. Banks tried to fi&s;h from the cabbin windows with hook and line: the water was too &s;hallow for fi&s;h; but the ground was almo&s;t covered with crabs, which readily took the bait, and &s;ometimes held it &s;o fa&s;t in their claws, that they did not quit their hold till they were con&s;iderably above water. The&s;e crabs were of two &s;orts, and both of them &s;uch as we had not &s;een before: one of them was adorned with the fine&s;t blue that can be ima|gined, in every re&s;pect equal to the ultramarine, with which all his claws, and every joint was deeply tinged: the under part of him was white, and &s;o exqui&s;itely poli&s;hed that in colour and brightne&s;s it exactly re&s;embled the white of old china: the other was al&s;o marked with the ultramarine upon his joints, and his toes, but &s;omewhat more &s;paringly; and his back was marked with three brown &s;pots which had a &s;ingular appearance. The people who had been out with the boat to &s;ound, reported, that upon an i&s;land where we had ob&s;erved two fires, they had &s;een &s;everal of the inhabi|tants, who called to them, and &s;eemed very de&s;irous that they &s;hould land. In the evening, the wind veered to E. N. E. which gave us an opportunity to &s;tretch three or four miles back by the way we came; after which, the wind &s;hifted to the South, and obliged us again to anchor in &s;ix fathom.</P>
<P>At five in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 27.</NOTE> I &s;ent away the Ma&s;ter to &s;earch for a pa&s;&s;age between the i&s;lands, while we got the &s;hip un|der &s;ail; and as &s;oon as it was light we followed the boat, which made a &s;ignal that a pa&s;&s;age had been found. As &s;oon as we got again into deep water, we made &s;ail to the northward, as the land lay, with &s;oundings from nine fathom to fifteen, and &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands &s;till without us. At noon we were
<PB N="526" REF="128">
about two leagues di&s;tant from the main;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Sunday 27.</NOTE> and by ob&s;erva|tion in latitude 22&deg; 53&prime; S. The northermo&s;t point of land in &s;ight now bore N. N. W. di&s;tant ten miles. To this point I gave the name of CAPE MANIFOLD, from the number of high hills which appeared over it: it lies in latitude 22&deg; 43&prime; S. and di&s;tant about &s;eventeen leagues from Cape Capricorn, in the direction of N. 26 W. Between the&s;e Capes the &s;hore forms a large bay, which I called KEPPEL BAY; and I al&s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the i&s;lands by the name of KEPPEL's ISLANDS. In this bay there is good anchorage; but what refre&s;hments it may afford, I know not: we caught no fi&s;h, though we were at anchor; but probably there is fre&s;h water in &s;everal places, as both the i&s;lands and the main are inhabited. We &s;aw &s;moke and fires upon the main; and upon the i&s;lands we &s;aw people. At three in the afternoon, we pa&s;&s;ed Cape Ma|nifold, from which the lands trends N. N. W. The land of the Cape is high, ri&s;ing in hills directly from the &s;ea; and may be known by three i&s;lands which lie off it, one of them near the &s;hore, and the other two eight miles out at &s;ea. One of the&s;e i&s;lands is low and flat, and the other high and round. At &s;ix o'clock in the evening we brought to, when the northermo&s;t part of the main in &s;ight bore N. W. and &s;ome i&s;lands which lie off it N. 31 W. Our &s;oundings after twelve o'clock were from twenty to twenty-five fathom, and in the night from thirty to thirty-four.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 28.</NOTE>At day-break we made &s;ail, Cape Manifold bearing S. by E. di&s;tant eight leagues, and the i&s;lands which I had &s;et the night before were di&s;tant four miles in the &s;ame direction. The farthe&s;t vi&s;ible point of the main bore N. 67 W. at the di&s;tance of twenty-two miles; but we could &s;ee &s;everal i&s;lands to the northward of this direction. At nine o'clock in the forenoon, we were abrea&s;t of the point which I called
<PB N="527" REF="129">
CAPE TOWNSHEND. It lies in latitude 22&deg; 15&prime;;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Monday 28.</NOTE> longitude 209&deg; 43&prime;: the land is high and level, and rather naked than woody. Several i&s;lands lie to the northward of it, at the di&s;|tance of four or five miles out at &s;ea; three or four leagues to the S. E. the &s;hore forms a bay, in the bottom of which there appeared to be an inlet or harbour. To the we&s;tward of the Cape the land trends S. W. &frac12; S. and there forms a very large bay which turns to the ea&s;tward, and probably communicates with the inlet, and makes the land of the Cape an i&s;land. As &s;oon as we got round this Cape, we hauled our wind to the we&s;tward, in order to get within the i&s;lands, which lie &s;cattered in the bay in great numbers, and extend out to &s;ea as far as the eye could reach even from the ma&s;t-head: the&s;e i&s;lands vary both in height and circuit from each other; &s;o that, although they are very numerous, no two of them are alike. We had not &s;tood long upon a wind before we came into &s;hoal water, and were obliged to tack at once to avoid it. Having &s;ent a boat ahead, I bore away W. by N. many &s;mall i&s;lands, rocks, and &s;hoals, lying be|tween us and the main, and many of a larger extent with|out us: our &s;oundings till near noon were from fourteen to &s;eventeen fathom, when the boat made the &s;ignal for meet|ing with &s;hoal water: upon this we hauled clo&s;e upon a wind to the ea&s;tward, but &s;uddenly fell into three fathom and a quarter; we immediately dropped an anchor, which brought the &s;hip up with all her &s;ails &s;tanding. When the &s;hip was brought up we had four fathom, with a coar&s;e &s;andy bottom, and found a &s;trong tide &s;etting to the N. W. by W. &frac12; W. at the rate of near three miles an hour, by which we were &s;o &s;uddenly carried upon the &s;hoal. Our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 22&deg; 8&prime; S.; Cape Town&s;hend bore E. 16 S. di&s;tant thirteen miles; and the we&s;termo&s;t part of

the main in &s;ight W. &frac34; N.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Monday 28.</NOTE> At this time a great number of i&s;lands lay all round us.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, having &s;ounded round the &s;hip, and found that there was water &s;ufficient to carry her over the &s;hoal, we weighed, and about three o'clock made &s;ail and &s;tood to the we&s;tward, as the land lay, having &s;ent a boat ahead to &s;ound. At &s;ix in the evening, we anchored in ten fathom, with a &s;andy bottom, at about two miles di&s;tance from the main; the we&s;termo&s;t part of which bore W. N. W. and a great number of i&s;lands, lying a long way without us, were &s;till in &s;ight.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 29.</NOTE>At five o'clock the next morning, I &s;ent away the Ma&s;ter with two boats to &s;ound the entrance of an inlet which bore from us we&s;t, at about the di&s;tance of a league, into which I intended to go with the &s;hip, that I might wait a few days till the moon &s;hould encrea&s;e, and in the mean time examine the country. As &s;oon as the &s;hip could be got under &s;ail, the boats made the &s;ignal for anchorage; upon which we &s;tood in, and anchored in five fathom water, about a league within the entrance of the inlet; which, as I ob&s;erved a tide to flow and ebb con&s;iderably, I judged to be a river that ran up the country to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. In this place I had thoughts of laying the &s;hip a&s;hore, and cleaning her bottom; I therefore landed with the Ma&s;ter in &s;earch of a convenient place for that purpo&s;e, and was accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. We found walking here exceedingly trouble|&s;ome, for the ground was covered with a kind of gra&s;s, the &s;eeds of which were very &s;harp and bearded backwards; &s;o that whenever they &s;tuck into our clothes, which indeed was at every &s;tep, they worked forwards by means of the beard, till they got at the fle&s;h; and at the &s;ame time we were &s;ur|rounded by a cloud of mu&s;quitos, which ince&s;&s;antly tor|mented
<PB N="529" REF="131">
us with their &s;tings.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Tue&s;day 29.</NOTE> We &s;oon met with &s;everal places where the &s;hip might conveniently be laid a&s;hore; but to our great di&s;appointment we could find no fre&s;h wa|ter. We proceeded however up the country, where we found gum trees like tho&s;e that we had &s;een before, and ob&s;erved that here al&s;o the gum was in very &s;mall quanti|ties. Upon the branches of the&s;e trees, and &s;ome others, we found ants ne&s;ts, made of clay, as big as a bu&s;hel, &s;omething like tho&s;e de&s;cribed in Sir Hans Sloan's Natural Hi&s;tory of Jamaica, vol. ii. p. 221, tab. 258, but not &s;o &s;mooth: the ants which inhabited the&s;e ne&s;ts were &s;mall, and their bodies white. But upon another &s;pecies of the tree we found a &s;mall black ant, which perforated all the twigs, and having worked out the pith, occupied the pipe which had contained it; yet the parts in which the&s;e in&s;ects had thus formed a lodg|ment, and in which they &s;warmed in amazing numbers, bore leaves and flowers, and appeared to be in as flouri&s;hing a &s;tate as tho&s;e that were &s;ound. We found al&s;o an incre|dible number of butterflies, &s;o that for the &s;pace of three or four acres the air was &s;o crowded with them that millions were to be &s;een in every direction, at the &s;ame time that every branch and twig was covered with others that were not upon the wing. We found here al&s;o a &s;mall fi&s;h of a &s;ingular kind; it was about the &s;ize of a minnow, and had two very &s;trong brea&s;t fins: we found it in places that were quite dry, where we &s;uppo&s;ed it might have been left by the tide; but it did not &s;eem to have become languid by the want of water; for upon our approach it leaped away, by the help of the brea&s;t fins, as nimbly as a frog: neither in|deed did it &s;eem to prefer water to land; for when we found it in the water, it frequently leaped out, and pur&s;ued its way upon dry ground: we al&s;o ob&s;erved that when it was in places where &s;mall &s;tones were &s;tanding above the &s;urface
<PB N="530" REF="132">
of the water at a little di&s;tance from each other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Tue&s;day 29.</NOTE> it cho&s;e ra|ther to leap from &s;tone to &s;tone, than to pa&s;s through the water; and we &s;aw &s;everal of them pa&s;s entirely over pud|dles in this manner, till they came to dry ground, and then leap away.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we renewed our &s;earch after fre&s;h water, but without &s;ucce&s;s; and therefore I determined to make my &s;tay here but &s;hort: however, having ob&s;erved from an emi|nence that the inlet penetrated a con&s;iderable way into the country, I determined to trace it in the morning.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 30.</NOTE>At &s;un-ri&s;e I went a&s;hore, and climbing a con&s;iderable hill, I took a view of the coa&s;t and the i&s;lands that lie off it, with their bearings, having an azimuth compa&s;s with me for that purpo&s;e; but I ob&s;erved that the needle differed very con&s;iderably in its po&s;ition, even to thirty degrees, in &s;ome places more, in others le&s;s; and once I found it differ from it&s;elf no le&s;s than two points in the di&s;tance of fourteen feet. I took up &s;ome of the loo&s;e &s;tones that lay upon the ground, and applied them to the needle, but they produced no effect; and I therefore concluded that there was iron ore in the hills, of which I had remarked other indications both here, and in the neighbouring parts. After I had made my ob&s;ervations upon the hill, I proceeded with Dr. Solander up the inlet; I &s;et out with the fir&s;t of the flood, and long before high-water I had advanced above eight leagues. Its breadth thus far was from two to five miles, upon a S. W. by S. direction; but here it opened every way, and formed a large lake, which to the N. W. communicated with the &s;ea; and I not only &s;aw the &s;ea in this direction, but found the tide of flood coming &s;trongly in from that point: I al&s;o ob&s;erved an arm of this lake extending to the ea&s;tward, and it is not im|probable that it may communicate with the &s;ea in the bot|tom
<PB N="531" REF="133">
of the bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Wedne&s;. 30.</NOTE> which lies to the we&s;tward of Cape Town|&s;hend. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the lake is a ridge of high hills which I was very de&s;irous to climb; but it being high-water, and the day far &s;pent, I was afraid of being bewildered among the &s;hoals in the night, e&s;pecially as the weather was dark and rainy; and therefore I made the be&s;t of my way to the &s;hip. In this excur&s;ion I &s;aw only two people, and they were at a di&s;tance; they followed the boat along the &s;hore a good way, but the tide running &s;trongly in my favour I could not prudently wait for them: I &s;aw however &s;everal fires in one direction, and &s;moke in another, but they al&s;o were at a di&s;tance. While I was tracing the inlet with Dr. Solander, Mr. Banks was endeavouring to penetrate into the country, where &s;everal of the people who had leave to go a&s;hore were al&s;o rambling about. Mr. Banks and his party found their cour&s;e ob&s;tructed by a &s;wamp, covered with mangroves, which however they re&s;olved to pa&s;s; the mud was almo&s;t knee deep, yet they re&s;olutely went on; but before they got half way, they repented of their undertaking: the bottom was covered with branches of trees interwoven with each other, &s;ometimes they kept their footing upon them, &s;ome|times their feet &s;lipt through, and &s;ometimes they were &s;o entangled among them, that they were forced to free them|&s;elves by groping in the mud and &s;lime with their hands. In about an hour however they cro&s;&s;ed it, and judged it might be about a quarter of a mile over. After a &s;hort walk they came up to a place where there had been four &s;mall &s;ires, and near them &s;ome &s;hells and bones of fi&s;h, that had been roa&s;ted: they found al&s;o heaps of gra&s;s laid together, where four or five people appeared to have &s;lept. The Second Lieutenant, Mr. Gore, who was at another place, &s;aw a little water lying in the bottom of a gully, and near it the track of a large animal: &s;ome bu&s;tards were al&s;o &s;een, but none
<PB N="532" REF="134">
of them &s;hot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. May. Wedne&s;. 30.</NOTE> nor any other bird except a few of the beauti|ful loriquets which we had &s;een in Botany Bay. Mr. Gore, and one of the mid&s;hipmen, who were in different places, &s;aid that they had heard the voices of Indians near them, but had &s;een none: the country in general appeared &s;andy and barren, and being de&s;titute of fre&s;h water, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any &s;ettled inhabitants. The deep gullies, which were worn by torrents from the hills, prove, that at certains &s;ea&s;ons the rains here are very copious and heavy.</P>
<P>The inlet in which the &s;hip lay I called THIRSTY SOUND, becau&s;e it afforded us no fre&s;h water. It lies in latitude 22&deg; 10&prime; S. and longitude 210&deg; 18&prime; W.; and may be known by a group of &s;mall i&s;lands lying under the &s;hore, from two to five leagues di&s;tant, in the direction of N. W. and by another group of i&s;lands that lie right before it, between three and four leagues out at &s;ea. Over each of the points that form the entrance is a high round hill, which on the N. W. is a penin&s;ula that at high-water is &s;urrounded by the &s;ea: they are bold to both the &s;hores, and the di&s;tance between them is about two miles. In this inlet is good anchorage in &s;even, &s;ix, five, and four fathom; and places very convenient for laying a &s;hip down, where, at &s;pring-tides, the water does not ri&s;e le&s;s than &s;ixteen or eighteen feet. The tide flows at the full and change of the moon about eleven o'clock. I have already ob&s;erved that here is no fre&s;h water, nor could we procure refre&s;hment of any other kind: we &s;aw two turtles, but we were not able to take either of them: neither did we catch either fi&s;h or wild-fowl, except a few &s;mall land-birds: we &s;aw indeed the &s;ame &s;orts of water-fowl as in Botany Bay, but they were &s;o &s;hy that we could not get a &s;hot at them.</P>
<P>As I had not therefore a &s;ingle inducement to &s;tay longer in this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 31.</NOTE> I weighed anchor at &s;ix o'clock in the morn|ing
<PB N="533" REF="135">
of Thur&s;day the 31&s;t of May, and put to &s;ea.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Thur&s;day 31.</NOTE> We &s;tood to the N. W. with a fre&s;h breeze at S. S. E. and kept without the group of i&s;lands that lie in &s;hore, and to the N. W. of Thir&s;ty Sound, as there appeared to be no &s;afe pa&s;&s;age be|tween them and the main: at the &s;ame time we had a number of i&s;lands without us, extending as far as we could &s;ee: during our run in this direction our depth of water was ten, eight, and nine fathom. At noon, the we&s;t point of Thir&s;ty Sound, which I have called PIER HEAD, bore S. 36 E. di&s;tant five leagues; the ea&s;t point of the other inlet, which com|municates with the Sound, bore S. by W. di&s;tant two leagues; the group of i&s;lands ju&s;t mentioned lay between us and the point, and the farthe&s;t part of the main in &s;ight, on the other &s;ide of the inlet, bore N. W. Our latitude by ob&s;erva|tion was 21&deg; 53&prime;. At half an hour after twelve, the boat, which was &s;ounding ahead, made the &s;ignal for &s;hoal water, and we immediately hauled our wind to the N. E. At this time we had &s;even fathom, at the next ca&s;t five, and at the next three, upon which we in&s;tantly dropped an anchor, that brought the &s;hip up. Pier Head, the north we&s;t point of Thir&s;ty-&s;ound, bore S. E. di&s;tant &s;ix leagues, being half-way between the i&s;lands which lie off the ea&s;t point of the we&s;t|ern inlet, and three &s;mall i&s;lands which lie directly without them. It was now the fir&s;t of the flood, which we found to &s;et N. W. by W. &frac12; W.; and having &s;ounded about the &s;hoal, upon which we had three fathom, and found deep water all round it, we got under &s;ail, and having hauled round the three i&s;lands that have been ju&s;t mentioned, came to an an|chor under the Ice of them, in fifteen fathom water; and the weather being dark, hazy, and rainy, we remained there till &s;even o'clock in the morning.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June. Friday 1.</NOTE> At this time we got again under fail, and &s;tood to the N. W. with a fre&s;h breeze at S. S. E.; having the main land in &s;ight, and a number of
<PB N="534" REF="136">
i&s;lands all round us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Friday 1.</NOTE> &s;ome of which lay out at &s;ea as far as the eye could reach. The we&s;tern inlet, which in the chart is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Broad Sound, we had now all open; at the entrance, it is at lea&s;t nine or ten leagues wide: in it, and before it, lie &s;everal i&s;lands, and probably &s;hoals al&s;o; for our &s;oundings were very irregular, varying &s;uddenly from ten to four fathom. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 21&deg; 29&prime; S.; a point of land which forms the north we&s;t entrance into Broad Sound, and which I have named CAPE PALMERSTON, lying in latitude 21&deg; 30&prime;, longi|tude 210&deg; 54&prime; W. bore W. by N. di&s;tant three leagues. Our latitude was 21&prime; 27&prime;, our longitude 210&deg; 57&prime;. Between this Cape and Cape Town&s;hend lies the bay which I have called the BAY OF INLETS. We continued to &s;tand to the N. W. and N. W. by N. as the land lay, under an ea&s;y &s;ail, having a boat ahead to &s;ound: at fir&s;t the &s;oundings were very irre|gular, from nine to four fathom; but afterwards they were regular, from nine to eleven. At eight in the evening, being about two leagues from the main land, we anchored in eleven fathom, with a &s;andy bottom; and &s;oon after we found the tide &s;etting with a &s;low motion to the we&s;tward. At one o'clock it was &s;lack, or low-water; and at half an hour after two the &s;hip tended to the ea&s;tward, and rode &s;o till &s;ix in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 2.</NOTE> when the tide had ri&s;en eleven feet. We now got under &s;ail, and &s;tood away in the direction of the coa&s;t, N. N. W. From what we had ob&s;erved of the tide during the night, it is plain, that the flood came from the N. W.; whereas the preceding day, and &s;everal days before, it came from the S. E.; nor was this the fir&s;t, or even &s;econd time that we had remarked the &s;ame thing. At &s;un-ri&s;e this morning, we found the variation to be 6&deg; 45&prime; E.; and in &s;teer|ing along the &s;hore, between the i&s;land and the main, at the di&s;tance of about two leagues from the main, and three or
<PB N="535" REF="137">
four from the i&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Saturday 2.</NOTE> our &s;oundings were regular from twelve to nine fathom; but about eleven o'clock in the fore|noon we were again embarra&s;&s;ed with &s;hoal water, having at one time not more than three fathom; yet we got clear, without ca&s;ting anchor. At noon we were about two leagues from the main, and four from the i&s;lands without us. Our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 20&deg; 56&prime;, and a high promontory, which I named CAPE HILLSBOROUGH, bore W. &frac12; N. di&s;tant &s;even miles. The land here is diver&s;ified by mountains, hills, plains, and valleys, and &s;eems to be well clothed with herbage and wood: the i&s;lands which lie parallel to the coa&s;t, and from five to eight or nine miles di&s;tant, are of va|rious height and extent; &s;carcely any of them are more than five leagues in circumference, and many are not four miles: be&s;ides this chain of i&s;lands, which lies at a di&s;tance from the coa&s;t, there are others much le&s;s, which lie under the land, from which we &s;aw &s;moke ri&s;ing in different places. We continued to &s;teer along the &s;hore at the di&s;tance of about two leagues, with regular &s;oundings from nine to ten fa|thom. At &s;un-&s;et, the farthe&s;t point of the main bore N. 48 W. and to the northward of this lay &s;ome high land, which I took to be an i&s;land, and of which the north we&s;t point bore 41 W.; but not being &s;ure of a pa&s;&s;age, I came to an anchor about eight o'clock in the evening, in ten fa|thom water, with a muddy bottom. About ten we had a tide &s;etting to the northward, and at two it had fallen nine feet; after this it began to ri&s;e, and the flood came from the northward, in the direction of the i&s;lands which lay out to &s;ea; a plain indication that there was no pa&s;&s;age to the N. W. This however had not appeared at day-break,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 3.</NOTE> when we got under &s;ail and &s;tood to the N. W.

leagues deep;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Sunday 3.</NOTE> upon this we hauled our wind to the ea&s;t|ward round the north point of the bay, which at this time bore from us N. E. by N. di&s;tant four leagues: from this point we found the land trend way N. by W. &frac12; W. and a &s;treight or pa&s;&s;age between it and a large i&s;land, or i&s;lands, lying parallel to it. Having the tide of ebb in our favour, we &s;tood for this pa&s;&s;age; and at noon were ju&s;t within the en|trance: our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 20&deg; 26&prime; S.; Cape Hill&s;|borough bore S. by E. di&s;tant ten leagues; and the north point of the bay S. 19 W. di&s;tant four miles. This point, which I named CAPE CONWAY, lies in latitude 26&deg; 36&prime; S. lon|gitude 211&deg; 28&prime; W.; and the bay which lies between this Cape and Cape Hill&s;borough I called REPULSE BAY. The greate&s;t depth of water which we found in it was thirteen fathom, and the lea&s;t eight. In all parts there was &s;afe anchorage, and I believe that, upon proper examination, &s;ome good har|bours would be found in it; e&s;pecially at the north &s;ide within Cape Conway; for ju&s;t within that Cape there lie two or three &s;mall i&s;lands, which alone would &s;helter that &s;ide of the bay from the &s;outherly and &s;outh ea&s;terly winds, that &s;eem to prevail here as a Trade. Among the many i&s;lands that lie upon this coa&s;t, there is one more remarkable than the re&s;t; it is of a &s;mall circuit, very high and peaked, and lies E. by S. ten miles from Cape Conway, at the &s;outh end of the pa&s;|&s;age. In the afternoon, we &s;teered through this pa&s;&s;age, which we found to be from three to &s;even miles broad, and eight or nine leagues in length, N. by W. &frac12; W., S. by E. &frac12; E. It is formed by the main on the we&s;t, and by the i&s;lands on the ea&s;t, one of which is at lea&s;t five leagues in length: our depth of water in running through was from twenty to five and twenty fathom, with good anchorage every where, and the whole pa&s;&s;age may be con&s;idered as one &s;afe harbour, ex|clu&s;ive of the &s;mall bays and coves which abound on each

&s;ide, where &s;hips might lie as in a ba&s;on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Sunday 3.</NOTE> The land both upon the main and i&s;lands is high, and diver&s;ified by hill and valley, wood and lawn, with a green and plea&s;ant appearance. On one of the i&s;lands we di&s;covered with our gla&s;&s;es two men and a woman, and a canoe with an out|rigger, which appeared to be larger, and of a con&s;truction very different from tho&s;e of bark tied together at the ends, which we had &s;een upon other parts of the coa&s;t; we hoped therefore that the people here had made &s;ome farther ad|vances beyond mere animal life than tho&s;e that we had &s;een before. At &s;ix o'clock in the evening, we were nearly the length of the north end of the pa&s;&s;age; the north we&s;termo&s;t point of the main in &s;ight bore N. 54 W. and the north end of the i&s;land N. N. E. with an open &s;ea between the two points. As this pa&s;&s;age was di&s;covered on Whit&s;unday, I called it WHITSUNDAY's PASSAGE, and I called the i&s;lands that form it CUMBERLAND ISLANDS, in honour of his Royal High|ne&s;s the Duke. We kept under an ea&s;y &s;ail, with the lead going all night, being at the di&s;tance of about three leagues from the &s;hore, and having from twenty-one to twenty-three fathom water. Ar day-break,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 4.</NOTE> we were abrea&s;t of the point which had been the farthe&s;t in &s;ight to the north we&s;t the evening before, which I named CAPE GLOUCESTER. It is a lofty promontory, in latitude 19&deg; 59&prime; S. longitude 211&deg; 49&prime; W. and may be known by an i&s;land which lies out at &s;ea N. by W. &frac12; W. at the di&s;tance of five or &s;ix leagues from it, and which I called HOLBORNE ISLE; there are al&s;o i&s;lands lying under the land between Holborne I&s;le, and Whit&s;unday's Pa&s;&s;age. On the we&s;t &s;ide of Cape Glouce&s;ter the land trends away S. W. and S. S. W. and forms a deep bay, the bottom of which I could but ju&s;t &s;ee from the ma&s;t-head: it is very low, and a continuation of the low land which we had &s;een at the bottom of Repul&s;e Bay. This bay I called EDGCUMBE BAY,
<PB N="538" REF="140">
but without &s;taying to look into it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Monday 4.</NOTE> we continued our cour&s;e to the we&s;tward, for the farthe&s;t land we could &s;ee in that direction, which bore W. by N. &frac12; N. and appeared very high. At noon, we were about three leagues from the &s;hore, by ob&s;ervation in latitude 19&deg; 47&prime; S. and Cape Glouce&s;ter bore S. 63 E. di&s;tant &s;even leagues and an half. At &s;ix in the evening, we were abrea&s;t of the we&s;termo&s;t point ju&s;t men|tioned, at about three miles di&s;tance, and becau&s;e it ri&s;es ab|ruptly from the low lands which &s;urround it, I called it CAPE UPSTART. It lies in latitude 19&deg; 39&prime; S. longitude 212&deg; 32&prime; W. fourteen leagues W. N. W. from Cape Glouce&s;ter, and is of a height &s;ufficient to be &s;een at the di&s;tance of twelve leagues: inland there are &s;ome high hills or mountains, which, like the Cape, afford but a barren pro&s;pect. Having pa&s;&s;ed this Cape, we continued &s;tanding to the W. N. W. as the land lay, under an ea&s;y &s;ail, having from &s;ixteen to ten fathom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 5.</NOTE> till two o'clock in the morning, when we fell into &s;even fathom; upon which we hauled our wind to the north|ward, judging our&s;elves to be very near land: at day-break, we found our conjecture to be true, being within little more than two leagues of it. In this part of the coa&s;t the land, being very low, is nearer than it appears to be, though it is diver&s;ified with here and there a hill. At noon, we were about four leagues from the land, in fifteen fathom water, and our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 19&deg; 12&prime; S. Cape Up&s;tart bearing S. 32&deg; 30&prime; E. di&s;tant twelve leagues. About this time &s;ome very large columns of &s;moke were &s;een ri&s;ing from the low lands. At &s;un-&s;et, the preceding night, when we were clo&s;e under Cape Up&s;tart, the variation was nearly 9&deg; E. and at &s;un-ri&s;e this day, it was no more than 5&deg; 35&prime;; I judged therefore that it had been influenced by iron ore, or other magnetical matter, contained under the &s;urface of the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="539" REF="141">We continued to &s;teer W. N. W. as the land lay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June.

W. &frac12; S. di&s;tant two leagues. This bay, which I named CLEAVELAND BAY, appeared to be about five or &s;ix miles in extent every way: the ea&s;t point I named CAPE CLEAVELAND, and the we&s;t, which had the appearance of an i&s;land, MAGNETICAL ISLE, as we perceived that the compa&s;s did not traver&s;e well when we were near it: they are both high, and &s;o is the main land within them, the whole forming a &s;urface the mo&s;t rugged, rocky, and barren of any we had &s;een upon the coa&s;t; it was not however without inhabitants, for we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal parts of the bottom of the bay. The northermo&s;t land that was in fight at this time, bore N. W. and it had the appearance of an i&s;land, for we could not trace the main land farther than W. by N. We &s;teered W. N. W. keeping the main land on board, the outermo&s;t part of which, at &s;un-&s;et, bore W. by N. but without it lay high land, which we judged not to be part of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 7.</NOTE> At day|break, we were abrea&s;t of the ea&s;tern part of this land, which we found to be a group of i&s;lands, lying about five leagues from the main: at this time, being between the two &s;hores, we advanced &s;lowly to the N. W. till noon, when our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 18&deg; 49&prime; S. and our di&s;tance from the main about five leagues: the north we&s;t part of it bore from us N. by W. &frac12; W. the i&s;lands extending from N. to E. and the neare&s;t being di&s;tant about two miles: Cape Cleave|land bore S. 50 E. di&s;tant eighteen leagues.

About &s;even o'clock in the evening they re|turned, with an account that what we had taken for cocoa nut-trees, were a &s;mall kind of cabbage palm, and that, ex|cept about fourteen or fifteen plants, they had met with no|thing worth bringing away. While they were a&s;hore, they &s;aw none of the people, but ju&s;t as they had put off, one of them came very near the beach, and &s;houted with a loud voice; it was &s;o dark that they could not &s;ee him, however they turned towards the &s;hore, but when he heard the boat putting back, he ran away or hid him&s;elf, for they could not get a glimp&s;e of him, and though they &s;houted he made no reply. After the return of the boats, we &s;tood away N. by W. for the northermo&s;t land in fight, of which we were abrea&s;t at three o'clock in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 8.</NOTE> having pa&s;&s;ed all the i&s;lands three or four hours before. This land, on account of its figure, I named POINT HILLOCK: it is of a con&s;iderable height, and may be known by a round hillock, or rock, which joins to the Point, but appears to be detached from it. Between this Cape and Magnetical I&s;le the &s;hore forms a large bay, which I called HALIFAX BAY: before it lay the group of i&s;lands which has been ju&s;t mentioned, and &s;ome others, at a le&s;s di&s;tance from the &s;hore. By the&s;e i&s;lands the Bay is &s;heltered from all winds, and it affords good an|chorage. The land near the beach, in the bottom of the Bay, is low and woody, but farther back it is one continued ridge of high land, which appeared to be barren and rocky. Having pa&s;&s;ed Point Hillock, we continued &s;tanding to the N. N. W. as the land trended, having the advantage of a light

Friday 8.</NOTE> we were abrea&s;t of a point of land which lies N. by W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant eleven miles from Point Hillock, which I named CAPE SANDWICH. Between the&s;e two points the land is very high, and the &s;urface is craggy and barren. Cape Sandwich may be known not only by the high craggy land over it, but by a &s;mall i&s;land which lies ea&s;t of it, at the di&s;tance of a mile, and &s;ome others that lie about two leagues to the northward. From Cape Sandwich the land trends W. and afterwards N. forming a fine large bay, which I called ROCKINGHAM BAY, where there appears to be good &s;helter, and good anchorage, but I did not &s;tay to examine it: I kept ranging along the &s;hore to the northward, for a clu&s;ter of &s;mall i&s;lands, which lie off the northern point of the Bay. Between the three outermo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands, and tho&s;e near the &s;hore, I found a channel of about a mile broad, through which I pa&s;&s;ed, and upon one of the neare&s;t i&s;lands we &s;aw with our gla&s;&s;es about thirty of the natives, men, women, and children, all &s;tanding together, and look|ing with great attention at the &s;hip; the fir&s;t in&s;tance of cu|rio&s;ity that we had &s;een among them: they were all &s;tark naked, with &s;hort hair, and of the &s;ame complexion with tho&s;e that we had &s;een before. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 17&deg; 59&prime;, and we were abrea&s;t of the north point of Rockingham Bay, which bore from us W. at the di&s;tance of about two miles. This boundary of the Bay is formed by an i&s;land of con&s;iderable height, which in the chart is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of DUNK ISLE, and which lies &s;o near the &s;hore as not to be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from it. Our longitude was 213&deg; 57&prime; W. Cape Sandwich bore S. by E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant nineteen miles, and the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight N. &frac12; W.: our depth of water for the la&s;t ten hours had not been more than &s;ixteen, nor le&s;s than &s;even fathom. At &s;un|&s;et, the northern extremity of the land bore N. 25 W. and we

kept our cour&s;e N. by W. along the coa&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Friday 8.</NOTE> at the di&s;tance of between three and four leagues, with an ea&s;y &s;ail all night, having from twelve to fifteen fathom water.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 9.</NOTE>At &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we were abrea&s;t of &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands, which we called FRANKLAND's ISLES, and which lie about two leagues di&s;tant from the main land. The mo&s;t di&s;tant point in &s;ight to the northward bore N. by W. &frac12; W. and we thought it was part of the main, but after|wards found it to be an i&s;land of con&s;iderable height, and about four miles in circuit. Between this i&s;land and a point on the main, from which it is di&s;tant about two miles, I pa&s;&s;ed with the &s;hip. At noon, we were in the middle of the channel, and by ob&s;ervation in the latitude of 16&deg; 57&prime; S. with twenty fathom water. The point on the main, of which we were now abrea&s;t, I called CAPE GRAFTON: its la|titude is 16&deg; 57&prime; S. and longitude 214&deg; 6&prime; W. and the land here, as well as the whole coa&s;t for about twenty leagues to the &s;outhward, is high, has a rocky &s;urface, and is thinly covered with wood: during the night we had &s;een &s;everal &s;ires, and about noon &s;ome people. Having hauled round Cape Grafton, we found the land trend away N. W. by W. and three miles to the we&s;tward of the Cape we found a bay, in which we anchored about two miles from the &s;hore, in four fathom water with an ouzey bottom. The ea&s;t point of the bay bore S. 74 E. the we&s;t point S. 83 W. and a low, green, woody i&s;land, which lies in the offing, N. 35 E. This i&s;land, which lies N. by E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant three or four leagues from Cape Grafton, is called in the chart GREEN ISLAND.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;hip was brought to an anchor, I went a&s;hore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. As my principal view was to procure &s;ome fre&s;h water, and as the bottom of the bay was low land covered with mangroves,
<PB N="543" REF="145">
where it was not probable fre&s;h water was to be found,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Saturday 9.</NOTE> I went out towards the Cape, and found two &s;mall &s;treams, which however were rendered very difficult of acce&s;s by the &s;urf and rocks upon the &s;hore: I &s;aw al&s;o, as I came round the Cape, a &s;mall &s;tream of water run over the beach, in a &s;andy cove, but I did not go in with the boat, becau&s;e I &s;aw that it would not be ea&s;y to land. When we got a&s;hore, we found the country every where ri&s;ing into &s;teep rocky hills, and as no fre&s;h water could conveniently be procured, I was unwilling to lo&s;e time by going in &s;earch of lower land el&s;e|where: we therefore made the be&s;t of our way back to the &s;hip, and about midnight we weighed and &s;tood to the N. W. hav|ing but little wind, with &s;ome &s;howers of rain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 10.</NOTE> At four in the morning, the breeze fre&s;hened at S. by E. and the weather became fair: we continued &s;teering N. N. W. &frac12; W. as the land lay, at about three leagues di&s;tance, with ten, twelve, and fourteen fathom water. At ten, we hauled off north, in order to get without a &s;mall low i&s;land, which lay at about two leagues di&s;tance from the main, and great part of which at this time, it being high water, was overflowed: about three leagues to the north we&s;t of this i&s;land, clo&s;e under the main land, is another i&s;land, the land of which ri&s;es to a greater height, and which at noon bore from us N. 55 W. di&s;tant &s;even or eight miles. At this time, our latitude was 16&deg; 20&prime; S. Cape Grafton bore S. 29 E. di&s;tant forty miles, and the north|ermo&s;t point of land in &s;ight N. 20 W.; our depth of water was fifteen fathom. Between this point and Cape Grafton, the &s;hore forms a large, but not a very deep bay, which being di&s;covered on Trinity Sunday, I called TRINITY BAY.</P>

<P>This Cape lies in latitude 16&deg; 6&prime; S. and longitude 214&deg; 39&prime; W. We &s;teered along the &s;hore N. by W. at the di&s;tance of be|tween three and four leagues, having from fourteen to twelve, and ten fathom water: in the offing we &s;aw two i&s;lands, which lie in latitude 16&deg; S. and about &s;ix or &s;even leagues from the main.

At this time we &s;hortened &s;ail, and hauled off &s;hore E. N. E. and N. E. by E. clo&s;e upon a wind, for it was my de&s;ign to &s;tretch off all night, as well to avoid the danger we &s;aw ahead, as to &s;ee whether any i&s;lands lay in the offing, e&s;pecially
<PB N="545" REF="147">
as we were now near the latitude a&s;&s;igned to the i&s;lands which were di&s;covered by Quiros,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Sunday 10.</NOTE> and which &s;ome geogra|phers, for what rea&s;on I know not, have thought fit to join to this land. We had the advantage of a fine breeze, and a clear moonlight night, and in &s;tanding off from &s;ix till near nine o'clock, we deepened our water from fourteen to twenty-one fathom, but while we were at &s;upper it &s;uddenly &s;hoaled, and we fell into twelve, ten, and eight fathom, within the &s;pace of a few minutes; I immediately ordered every body to their &s;tation, and all was ready to put about and come to an anchor, but meeting at the next ca&s;t of the lead with deep water again, we concluded that we had gone over the tail of the &s;hoals which we had &s;een at &s;un-&s;et, and that all danger was pa&s;t: before ten, we had twenty and one and twenty fathom, and this depth continuing, the gen|tlemen left the deck in great tranquility, and went to bed; but a few minutes before eleven, the water &s;hallowed at once from twenty to &s;eventeen fathom, and before the lead could be ca&s;t again, the &s;hip &s;truck, and remained immove|able, except by the heaving of the &s;urge, that beat her again&s;t the craggs of the rock upon which &s;he lay. In a few moments every body was upon the deck, with counte|nances which &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed the horrors of our &s;itu|ation. We had &s;tood off the &s;hore three hours and a half, with a plea&s;ant breeze, and therefore knew that we could not be very near it, and we had too much rea&s;on to conclude that we were upon a rock of coral, which is more fatal than any other, becau&s;e the points of it are &s;harp, and every part of the &s;urface &s;o rough as to grind away whatever is rubbed again&s;t it, even with the gentle&s;t motion. In this &s;ituation all the &s;ails were immediately taken in, and the boats hoi&s;ted out to examine the depth of water round the &s;hip: we &s;oon di&s;covered that our fears had not aggravated our misfor|tune,
<PB N="546" REF="148">
and that the ve&s;&s;el had been lifted over a ledge of the rock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Sunday 10.</NOTE> and lay in a hollow within it: in &s;ome places there was from three to four fathom, and in others not &s;o many feet. The &s;hip lay with her head to the N. E.; and at the di&s;tance of about thirty yards on the &s;tarboard &s;ide, the water deepened to eight, ten, and twelve fathom. As &s;oon as the long-boat was out, we &s;truck our yards and top-ma&s;ts, and carried out the &s;tream anchor on the &s;tarboard bow, got the coa&s;ting an|chor and cable into the boat, and were going to carry it out the &s;ame way; but upon &s;ounding a &s;econd time round the &s;hip, the water was found to be deepe&s;t a&s;tern: the anchor therefore was carried out from the &s;tarboard quarter in&s;tead of the &s;tarboard bow, that is, from the &s;tern in&s;tead of the head, and having taken ground, our utmo&s;t force was ap|plied to the cap&s;tern, hoping that if the anchor did not come home, the &s;hip would be got off, but to our great misfortune and di&s;appointment we could not move her: during all this time &s;he continued to beat with great violence again&s;t the rock, &s;o that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that we kept upon our legs; and to complete the &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, we &s;aw by the light of the moon the &s;heathing boards from the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el floating away all round her, and at la&s;t her fal&s;e keel, &s;o that every moment was making way for the &s;ea to ru&s;h in which was to &s;wallow us up. We had now no chance but to lighten her, and we had lo&s;t the opportu|nity of doing that to the greate&s;t advantage, for unhappily we went on &s;hore ju&s;t at high water, and by this time it had con&s;iderably fallen, &s;o that after &s;he &s;hould be lightened &s;o as to draw as much le&s;s water as the water had &s;unk, we &s;hould be but in the &s;ame &s;ituation as at fir&s;t; and the only alleviation of this circum&s;tance was, that as the tide ebbed the &s;hip &s;ettled to the rocks, and was not beaten again&s;t them with &s;o much violence. We had indeed &s;ome hope from the
<PB N="547" REF="149">
next tide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June.

This however was no time to indulge con|jecture, nor was any effort remitted in de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s: that no time might be lo&s;t, the water was immediately &s;tarted in the hold, and pumped up; &s;ix of our guns, being all we had upon the deck, our iron and &s;tone balla&s;t, ca&s;ks, hoop &s;taves, oil jars, decayed &s;tores, and many other things that lay in the way of heavier materials, were thrown over|board with the utmo&s;t expedition, every one exerting him|&s;elf with an alacrity almo&s;t approaching to cheerfulne&s;s, without the lea&s;t repining or di&s;content; yet the men were &s;o far impre&s;t with a &s;en&s;e of their &s;ituation, that not an oath was heard among them, the habit of profanene&s;s, however &s;trong, being in&s;tantly &s;ubdued, by the dread of incurring guilt when death &s;eemed to be &s;o near.</P>
<P>While we were thus employed, day broke upon us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 11.</NOTE> and we &s;aw the land at about eight leagues di&s;tance, without any i&s;land in the intermediate &s;pace, upon which, if the &s;hip &s;hould have gone to pieces, we might have been &s;et a&s;hore by the boats, and from which they might have taken us by different turns to the main: the wind however gra|dually died away, and early in the forenoon it was a dead calm; if it had blown hard, the &s;hip mu&s;t inevitably have been de&s;troyed. At eleven in the forenoon we expected high water, and anchors were got out, and every thing made ready for another effort to heave her off if &s;he &s;hould float, but to our inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urprize and concern &s;he did not float by a foot and a half, though we had lightened her near fifty ton, &s;o much did the day-tide fall &s;hort of that in the night. We now proceeded to lighten her &s;till more, and threw overboard every thing that it was po&s;&s;ible for us to

Monday 11.</NOTE> hitherto &s;he had not admitted much water, but as the tide fell, it ru&s;hed in &s;o fa&s;t, that two pumps, ince&s;&s;antly worked, could &s;carcely keep her free. At two o'clock, &s;he lay heeling two or three &s;treaks to &s;tarboard, and the pin|nace, which lay under her bows, touched the ground: we had now no hope but from the tide at midnight, and to pre|pare for it we carried out our two bower anchors, one on the &s;tarboard quarter, and the other right a-&s;tern, got the blocks and tackle which were to give us a purcha&s;e upon the cables in order, and brought the falls, or ends of them, in abaft, &s;training them tight, that the next effort might operate upon the &s;hip, and by &s;hortening the length of the cable between that and the anchors, draw her off the ledge upon which &s;he re&s;ted, towards the deep water. About five o'clock in the afternoon, we ob&s;erved the tide begin to ri&s;e, but we ob|&s;erved at the &s;ame time that the leak increa&s;ed to a mo&s;t alarming degree, &s;o that two more pumps were manned, but unhappily only one of them would work: three of the pumps however were kept going, and at nine o'clock the &s;hip righted, but the leak had gained upon us &s;o con&s;ide|rably, that it was imagined &s;he mu&s;t go to the bottom as &s;oon as &s;he cea&s;ed to be &s;upported by the rock: this was a dreadful circum&s;tance, &s;o that we anticipated the floating of the &s;hip not as an earne&s;t of deliverance, but as an event that would probably precipitate our de&s;truction. We well knew that our boats were not capable of carrying us all on &s;hore, and that when the dreadful cri&s;is &s;hould arrive, as all com|mand and &s;ubordination would be at an end, a conte&s;t for preference would probably en&s;ue, that would increa&s;e the horrors even of &s;hipwreck, and terminate in the de&s;truction of us all by the hands of each other; yet we knew that if any &s;hould be left on board to peri&s;h in the waves, they would probably &s;uffer le&s;s upon the whole than tho&s;e who
<PB N="549" REF="151">
&s;hould get on &s;hore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Monday 11.</NOTE> without any la&s;ting or effectual defence again&s;t the natives, in a country, where even nets and fire|arms would &s;carcely furni&s;h them with food; and where, if they &s;hould find the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, they mu&s;t be con|demned to langui&s;h out the remainder of life in a de&s;olate wilderne&s;s, without the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or even hope, of any do|me&s;tic comfort, and cut off from all commerce with man|kind, except the naked &s;avages who prowled the de&s;ert, and who perhaps were &s;ome of the mo&s;t rude and uncivilized upon the earth.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e only who have waited in a &s;tate of &s;uch &s;u&s;pen&s;e, death has approached in all his terrors; and as the dreadful moment that was to determine our fate came on, every one &s;aw his own &s;en&s;ations pictured in the countenances of his companions: however, the cap&s;tan and windlace were man|ned with as many hands as could be &s;pared from the pumps, and the &s;hip floating about twenty minutes after ten o'clock, the effort was made, and &s;he was heaved into deep water. It was &s;ome comfort to find that &s;he did not now admit more water than &s;he had done upon the rock; and though, by the gaining of the leak upon the pumps, there was no le&s;s than three feet nine inches water in the hold, yet the men did not relinqui&s;h their labour, and we held the water as it were at bay; but having now endured exce&s;&s;ive fatigue of body and agitation of mind for more than four and twenty hours, and having but little hope of &s;ucceeding at la&s;t, they began to flag: none of them could work at the pump more than five or &s;ix minutes together, and then, being totally exhau&s;ted, they threw them&s;elves down upon the deck, though a &s;tream of water was running over it from the pumps between three and four inches deep; when tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded them had worked their &s;pell, and were exhau&s;ted in their turn, they threw them&s;elves down in the &s;ame manner, and the others
<PB N="550" REF="152">
&s;tarted up again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Monday 11.</NOTE> and renewed their labour; thus relieving each other till an accident was very near putting an end to their efforts at once. The planking which lines the in&s;ide of the &s;hip's bottom is called the cieling, and between this, and the out&s;ide planking, there is a &s;pace of about eighteen inches: the man who till this time had attended the well to take the depth of water, had taken it only to the cieling, and gave the mea&s;ure accordingly; but he being now relieved, the per&s;on who came in his &s;tead, reckoned the depth to the out&s;ide planking, by which it appeared in a few minutes to have gained upon the pumps eighteen inches, the difference between the planking without and within. Upon this, even the brave&s;t was upon the point of giving up his labour with his hope, and in a few minutes every thing would have been involved in all the confu&s;ion of de&s;pair. But this accident, however dreadful in its fir&s;t con&s;equences, was eventually the cau&s;e of our pre&s;ervation: the mi&s;take was &s;oon detected, and the &s;udden joy which every man felt upon finding his &s;ituation better than his fears had &s;ugge&s;ted, operated like a charm, and &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s him with a &s;trong belief that &s;carcely any real danger remained. New confidence and new hope, however founded, in&s;pired new vigour; and though our &s;tate was the &s;ame as when the men fir&s;t began to &s;lacken in their labour, through wearine&s;s and de&s;pon|dency, they now renewed their efforts with &s;uch alacrity and &s;pirit, that before eight o'clock in the morning the leak was &s;o far from having gained upon the pumps, that the pumps had gained con&s;iderably upon the leak. Every body now talked of getting the &s;hip into &s;ome harbour, as a thing not to be doubted, and as hands could be &s;pared from the pumps, they were employed in getting up the anchors: the &s;tream anchor and be&s;t bower we had taken on board; but it was found impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave the little bower, and therefore it
<PB N="551" REF="153">
was cut away at a whole cable:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Monday 11.</NOTE> we lo&s;t al&s;o the cable of the &s;tream anchor among the rocks; but in our &s;ituation the&s;e were trifles which &s;carcely attracted our notice. Our next bu&s;ine&s;s was to get up the fore-topma&s;t and fore-yard, and warp the &s;hip to the &s;outhea&s;t, and at eleven, having now a breeze from the &s;ea, we once more got under &s;ail and &s;tood for the land.</P>
<P>It was however impo&s;&s;ible long to continue the labour by which the pumps had been made to gain upon the leak, and as the exact &s;ituation of it could not be di&s;covered, we had no hope of &s;topping it within. In this &s;ituation, Mr. Monkhou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 12.</NOTE> one of my mid&s;hipmen, came to me and propo&s;ed an expe|dient that he had once &s;een u&s;ed on board a merchant &s;hip, which &s;prung a leak that admitted above four feet water an hour, and which by this expedient was brought &s;afely from Virginia to London; the ma&s;ter having &s;uch confidence in it, that he took her out of harbour, knowing her condition, and did not think it worth while to wait till the leak could be otherwi&s;e &s;topped. To this man, therefore, the care of the expedient, which is called fothering the &s;hip, was im|mediately committed, four or five of the people being ap|pointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and he performed it in this manner: He took a lower &s;tudding &s;ail, and having mixed together a large quantity of oakham and wool, chopped pretty &s;mall, he &s;titched it down in handfuls upon the &s;ail, as lightly as po&s;&s;ible, and over this he &s;pread the dung of our &s;heep and other filth; but hor&s;e dung, if we had had it, would have been better. When the &s;ail was thus prepared, it was hauled under the &s;hip's bottom by ropes, which kept it extended, and when it came under the leak, the &s;uction which carried in the water, carried in with it the oakham and wool from the &s;urface of the &s;ail, which in other parts the water was
<PB N="552" REF="154">
not &s;ufficiently agitated to wa&s;h off.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Tue&s;day 12.</NOTE> By the &s;ucce&s;s of this expedient our leak was &s;o far reduced, that in&s;tead of gain|ing upon three pumps, it was ea&s;ily kept under with one. This was a new &s;ource of confidence and comfort; the peo|ple could &s;carcely have expre&s;&s;ed more joy if they had been already in port; and their views were &s;o far from being limited to running the &s;hip a&s;hore in &s;ome harbour, either of an i&s;land or the main, and building a ve&s;&s;el out of her materials, to carry us to the Ea&s;t Indies, which had &s;o lately been the utmo&s;t object of our hope, that nothing was now thought of but ranging along the &s;hore in &s;earch of a con|venient place to repair the damage &s;he had &s;u&s;tained, and then pro&s;ecuting the voyage upon the &s;ame plan as if no|thing had happened. Upon this occa&s;ion I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, both in ju&s;tice and gratitude to the &s;hip's company, and the Gentlemen on board, that although in the mid&s;t of our di&s;|tre&s;s every one &s;eemed to have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his danger, yet no pa&s;&s;ionate exclamations, or frantic ge&s;tures, were to be heard or &s;een; every one appeared to have the perfect po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind, and every one exerted him&s;elf to the ut|termo&s;t, with a quiet and patient per&s;everance, equally di&s;|tant from the tumultuous violence of terror, and the gloomy inactivity of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>In the mean time, having light airs at E.S.E. we got up the main-topma&s;t, and main-yard, and kept edging in for the land, till about &s;ix o'clock in the evening, when we came to an anchor in &s;eventeen fathom water, at the di&s;tance of &s;even leagues from the &s;hore, and one from the ledge of rocks upon which we had &s;truck.</P>
<P>This ledge or &s;hoal lies in latitude 15&deg; 45&prime; S. and between &s;ix and &s;even leagues from the main. It is not however the only &s;hoal on this part of the coa&s;t, e&s;pecially to the north|ward;
<PB N="553" REF="155">
and at this time we &s;aw one to the &s;outhward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Tue&s;day 12.</NOTE> the tail of which we pa&s;&s;ed over, when we had uneven &s;ound|ings about two hours before we &s;truck. A part of this &s;hoal is always above water, and has the appearance of white &s;and: a part al&s;o of that upon which we had lain is dry at low water, and in that place con&s;i&s;ts of &s;and &s;tones; but all the re&s;t of it is a coral rock.</P>
<P>While we lay at anchor for the night, we found that the &s;hip made about fifteen inches water an hour, from which no immediate danger was to be apprehended; and at &s;ix o'clock in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 13.</NOTE> we weighed and &s;tood to the N. W. &s;till edging in for the land with a gentle breeze at S. S. E. At nine we pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e without two &s;mall i&s;lands that lie in latitude 15&deg; 41&prime; S. and about four leagues from the main: to reach the&s;e i&s;lands had, in the height of our di&s;tre&s;s, been the object of our hope, or perhaps rather of our wi&s;hes, and therefore I called them HOPE ISLANDS. At noon we were about three leagues from the land, and in latitude 15&deg; 37&prime; S.; the northermo&s;t part of the main in &s;ight bore N. 30 W.; and Hope I&s;lands extended from S. 30 E. to S. 40 E. In this &s;itua|tion we had twelve fathom water, and &s;everal &s;and-banks without us. At this time the leak had not increa&s;ed; but that we might be prepared for all events, we got the &s;ail ready for another fothering. In the afternoon, having a gentle breeze at S. E. by E. I &s;ent out the Ma&s;ter with two boats, as well to &s;ound ahead of the &s;hip, as to look out for a harbour where we might repair our defects, and put the &s;hip in a proper trim. At three o'clock, we &s;aw an opening that had the appearance of an harbour, and &s;tood off and on while the boats examined it; but they &s;oon found that there was not depth of water in it &s;ufficient for the &s;hip. When it was near &s;un&s;et, there being many &s;hoals about us, we
<PB N="554" REF="156">
anchored in four fathom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Wedne&s;. 13.</NOTE> at the di&s;tance of about two miles from the &s;hore, the land extending from N. &frac12; E. to S. by E. &frac12; E. The pinnace was &s;till out with one of the mates; but at nine o'clock &s;he returned, and reported, that about two leagues to leeward &s;he had di&s;covered ju&s;t &s;uch a harbour as we wanted, in which there was a &s;ufficient ri&s;e of water, and every other convenience that could be de&s;ired, either for laying the &s;hip a&s;hore, or heaving her down.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this information, I weighed at &s;ix o'clock in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 14.</NOTE> and having &s;ent two boats ahead, to lie upon the &s;hoals that we &s;aw in our way, we ran down to the place; but notwith&s;tanding our precaution, we were once in three fathom water. As &s;oon as the&s;e &s;hoals were pa&s;&s;ed, I &s;ent the boats to lie in the channel that led to the harbour, and by this time it began to blow. It was happy far us that a place of refuge was at hand; for we &s;oon found that the &s;hip would not work, having twice mi&s;&s;ed &s;tays: our &s;itua|tion, however, though it might have been much wor&s;e, was not without danger; we were entangled among &s;hoals, and I had great rea&s;on to fear being driven to leeward, before the boats could place them&s;elves &s;o as to pre&s;cribe our cour&s;e. I therefore anchored in four fathom, about a mile from the &s;hore, and then made the &s;ignal for the boats to come on board. When this was done I went my&s;elf and buoyed the channel, which I found very narrow; the harbour al&s;o I found &s;maller than I expected, but mo&s;t excellently adapted to our purpo&s;e; and it is remarkable, that in the whole cour&s;e of our voyage we had &s;een no place which, in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, could have afforded us the &s;ame re|lief. At noon, our latitude was 15&deg; 26&prime; S. During all the re&s;t of this day, and the whole night, it blew too fre&s;h for us to venture from our anchor and run into the harbour; and for
<PB N="555" REF="157">
our farther &s;ecurity, we got down the top-gallant yards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Thur&s;day 14.</NOTE> un|bent the main&s;ail and &s;ome of the &s;mall &s;ails; got down the fore-top-gallant ma&s;t, and the gibb boom, and &s;prit-&s;ail, with a view to lighten the &s;hip forwards as much as po&s;&s;ible, in order to come at her leak, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ome|where in that part; for in all the joy of our unexpected de|liverance, we had not forgot that at this time there was no|thing but a lock of wool between us and de&s;truction. The gale continuing, we kept our &s;tation all the 15th.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 15.</NOTE> On the 16th, it was &s;omewhat more moderate;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 10.</NOTE> and about &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we hove the cable &s;hort, with a de&s;ign to get under &s;ail, but were obliged to de&s;i&s;t, and veer it out again. It is remarkable that the &s;ea breeze, which blew fre&s;h when we anchored, continued to do &s;o almo&s;t every day while we &s;tayed here; it was calm only while we were upon the rock, except once; and even the gale that afterwards wafted us to the &s;hore, would then certainly have beaten us to pieces. In the evening of the preceding day, we had ob|&s;erved a fire near the beach over again&s;t us; and as it would be nece&s;&s;ary for us to &s;tay &s;ometime in this place, we were not without hope of making an acquaintance with the peo|ple. We &s;aw more fires upon the hills to-day, and with our gla&s;&s;es di&s;covered four Indians going along the &s;hore, who &s;topped, and made two fires; but for what purpo&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould gue&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;curvy now began to make its appearance among us, with many formidable &s;ymptoms. Our poor Indian, Tupia, who had &s;ome time before complained that his gums were &s;ore and &s;welled, and who had taken plentifully of our le|mon juice by the Surgeon's direction, had now livid &s;pots upon his legs, and other indubitable te&s;timonies that the di&s;ea&s;e had made a rapid progre&s;s, notwith&s;tanding all our remedies, among which the bark had been liberally admi|ni&s;tered.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 17.</NOTE>In the morning of the 17th, though the wind was &s;till fre&s;h, we ventured to weigh, and pu&s;h in for the harbour; but in doing this we twice run the &s;hip aground: the fir&s;t time &s;he went off without any trouble, but the &s;econd time &s;he &s;tuck fa&s;t. We now got down the fore yard, fore top|ma&s;ts, and booms, and taking them overboard, made a raft of them along&s;ide of the &s;hip. The tide was happily ri&s;ing, and about one o'clock in the afternoon, &s;he floated. We &s;oon warped her into the harbour, and having moored her along|&s;ide of a &s;teep beach to the &s;outh, we got the anchors, ca|bles, and all the haw&s;ers on &s;hore before night.</P>

<P>IN the morning of Monday the 18th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Monday 18.</NOTE> a &s;tage was made from the &s;hip to the &s;hore, which was &s;o bold that &s;he floated at twenty feet di&s;tance: two tents were al&s;o &s;et up, one for the &s;ick, and the other for &s;tores and provi&s;ions, which were landed in the cour&s;e of the day. We al&s;o landed all the empty water ca&s;ks, and part of the &s;tores. As &s;oon as the tent for the &s;ick was got ready for their reception, they were &s;ent a&s;hore to the number of eight or nine, and the boat was di&s;patch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to haul the &s;eine, in hopes of procuring &s;ome fi&s;h for the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> refre&s;hment; but &s;he returned without &s;ucce&s;s. In the mean time, I climbed one of the highe&s;t hills among tho&s;e that overlooked the harbour, which afforded by no means a comfortable pro&s;pect: the low land near the river is wholly over-run with mangroves, among which the &s;alt-water &s;lows every tide; and the high land appeared to be every where &s;toney and barren. In the mean time Mr. Banks had al&s;o taken a walk up the country, and met with the frames of &s;everal old Indian hou&s;es, and places where they had dre&s;&s;ed &s;hell-fi&s;h; but they &s;eemed not to have been frequented for &s;ome months. Tupia, who had employed him&s;elf in angling, and lived intirely upon what he caught, recovered in a &s;urpri&s;ing degree; but Mr. Green &s;till conti|nued to be extremely ill.</P>
<P><PB N="558" REF="161"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Tue&s;day 19.</NOTE>The next morning I got the four remaining guns out of the hold, and mounted them upon the quarter-deck; I al&s;o got a &s;pare anchor, and anchor-&s;tock a&s;hore, and the remain|ing part of the &s;tores and balla&s;t that were in the hold: &s;et up the &s;mith's forge, and employed the armourer and his mate to make nails and other nece&s;&s;aries for the repair of the &s;hip. In the afternoon, all the officers' &s;tores and the ground tier of water were got out; &s;o that nothing remained in the fore and main hold, but the coals, and a &s;mall quantity of &s;tone balla&s;t. This day Mr. Banks cro&s;&s;ed the river to take a view of the country on the other &s;ide: he found it con&s;i&s;t principally of &s;and-hills, where he &s;aw &s;ome Indian hou&s;es, which appeared to have been very lately inhabited. In his walk, he met with va&s;t flocks of pigeons and crows: of the pigeons, which were exceedingly beautiful, he &s;hot &s;everal; but the crows, which were exactly like tho&s;e in England, were &s;o &s;hy that he could not get within reach of them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 20.</NOTE>On the 20th, we landed the powder, and got out the &s;tone balla&s;t and wood, which brought the &s;hip's draught of wa|ter to eight feet ten inches forward, and thirteen feet abaft; and this I thought, with the difference that would be made by trimming the coals aft, would be &s;ufficient; for I found that the water ro&s;e and fell perpendicularly eight feet at the &s;pring-tides: but as &s;oon as the coals were trimmed from over the leak, we could hear the water ru&s;h in a little abaft the forema&s;t, about three feet from the keel: this deter|mined me to clear the hold intirely. This evening, Mr. Banks ob&s;erved that in many parts of the inlet there were large quantities of pumice &s;tones, which lay at a con&s;ide|rable di&s;tance above high-water mark; whither they might have been carried either by the fre&s;hes or extraordinary high tides, for there could be no doubt but that they came from the &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="559" REF="162">The next morning we went early to work,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Thur&s;day 21.</NOTE> and by four o'clock in the afternoon had got out all the coals, ca&s;t the moorings loo&s;e, and warped the &s;hip a little higher up the harbour to a place which I thought mo&s;t convenient for lay|ing her a&s;hore in order to &s;top the leak. Her draught of water forward was now &s;even feet nine inches, and abaft thirteen feet &s;ix inches. At eight o'clock, it being high-water, I hauled her bow clo&s;e a&s;hore; but kept her &s;tern afloat, becau&s;e I was afraid of neiping her; it was however nece&s;&s;ary to lay the whole of her as near the ground as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>At two o'clock in the morning of the 22d, the tide left her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 22.</NOTE> and gave us an opportunity to examine the leak, which we found to be at her floor heads, a little before the &s;tarboard fore-chains. In this place the rocks had made their way through four planks, and even into the timbers; three more planks were much damaged, and the appearance of the&s;e breaches was very extraordinary: there was not a &s;plinter to be &s;een, but all was as &s;mooth, as if the whole had been cut away by an in&s;trument: the timbers in this place were happily very clo&s;e, and if they had not, it would have been ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to have &s;aved the &s;hip. But after all, her pre&s;ervation depended upon a circum&s;tance &s;till more remarkable: in one of the holes, which was big enough to have &s;unk us, if we had had eight pumps in&s;tead of four, and been able to keep them ince&s;&s;antly going, was in great mea&s;ure plugged up by a fragment of the rock, which, after having made the wound, was left &s;ticking in it; &s;o that the water which at fir&s;t bad gained upon our pumps, was what came in at the inter&s;tices, between the &s;tone and the edges of the hole that received it. We found al&s;o &s;everal pieces of the fothering, which had made their way between the
<PB N="560" REF="163">
timbers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Friday 22.</NOTE> and in a great mea&s;ure &s;topped tho&s;e parts of the leak which the &s;tone had left open. Upon further examina|tion, we found that, be&s;ides the leak, con&s;iderable damage had been done to the bottom; great part of the &s;heathing was gone from under the larboard bow; a con&s;iderable part of the fal&s;e keel was al&s;o wanting, and the&s;e indeed we had &s;een &s;wim away in fragments from the ve&s;&s;el, while &s;he lay beating again&s;t the rock: the remainder of it was in &s;o &s;hat|tered a condition that it had better have been gone, and the fore foot and main keel were al&s;o damaged, but not &s;o as to produce any immediate danger: what damage &s;he might have received abaft could not yet be exactly known, but we had rea&s;on to think it was not much, as but little water made its way into her bottom, while the tide kept below the leak which has already been de&s;cribed. By nine o'clock in the morning the carpenters got to work upon her, while the &s;miths were bu&s;y in making bolts and nails. In the mean time, &s;ome of the people were &s;ent on the other &s;ide of the water to &s;hoot pigeons for the &s;ick, who at their return reported that they had &s;een an animal as large as a greyhound, of a &s;lender make, a mou&s;e colour, and extremely &s;wift; they di&s;covered al&s;o many Indian hou&s;es, and a fine &s;tream of fre&s;h water.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 23.</NOTE>The next morning, I &s;ent a boat to haul the &s;eine; but at noon it returned with only three fi&s;h, and yet we &s;aw them in plenty leaping about the harbour. This day the carpen|ter fini&s;hed the repairs that were nece&s;&s;ary on the &s;tarboard &s;ide; and at nine o'clock in the evening, we heeled the &s;hip the other way, and hauled her off about two feet for fear of neiping. This day almo&s;t every body had &s;een the animal which the pigeon-&s;hooters had brought an account of the day before; and one of the &s;eamen, who had been rambling in the woods, told us at his return, that he verily believed

he had &s;een the devil:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Saturday 23.</NOTE> we naturally enquired in what form he had appeared, and his an&s;wer was in &s;o &s;ingular a &s;tile that I &s;hall &s;et down his own words; <Q>He was, &s;ays John, as large as a one gallon keg, and very like it; he had horns and wings, yet he crept &s;o &s;lowly through the gra&s;s, that if I had not been <HI>afeard</HI> I might have touched him.</Q> This formidable apparition we afterwards di&s;covered to have been a batt; and the batts here mu&s;t be acknowledged to have a frightful appearance, for they are nearly black, and full as large as a partridge; they have indeed no horns, but the fancy of a man who thought he &s;aw the devil might ea&s;ily &s;upply that defect.</P>
<P>Early on the 24th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 24.</NOTE> the carpenters began to repair the &s;heathing under the larboard bow, where we found two planks cut about half through; and in the mean time I &s;ent a party of men, under the direction of Mr. Gore, in &s;earch of refre&s;hments for the &s;ick: this party returned about noon with a few palm cabbages, and a bunch or two of wild plan|tains; the plantains were the &s;malle&s;t I had ever &s;een, and the pulp, though it was well ta&s;ted, was full of &s;mall &s;tones. As I was walking this morning at a little di&s;tance from the &s;hip, I &s;aw my&s;elf one of the animals which had been &s;o often de&s;cribed&punc; it was of a light mou&s;e colour, and in &s;ize and &s;hape very much re&s;embling a greyhound; it had a long tail al&s;o, which it carried like a greyhound; and I &s;hould have taken it for a wild dog, if in&s;tead of running, it had not leapt like a hare or deer: its legs were &s;aid to be very &s;lender, and the print of its foot to be like that of a goat; but where I &s;aw it the gra&s;s was &s;o high that the legs were concealed, and the ground was too hard to receive the track. Mr. Banks al&s;o had an imperfect view of this animal, and was of opi|nion that its &s;pecies was hitherto unknown.</P>
<P><PB N="562" REF="166"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June. Sunday 24.</NOTE>After the &s;hip was hauled a&s;hore, all the water that came into her of cour&s;e went backwards; &s;o that although &s;he was dry forward, &s;he had nine feet water abaft: as in this part therefore her bottom could not be examined on the in&s;ide, I took the advantage of the tide being out this evening to get the ma&s;ter and two of the men to go under her, and exa|mine her whole larboard &s;ide without. They found the &s;heathing gone about the floor heads abrea&s;t of the main|ma&s;t, and part of a plank a little damaged; but all agreed that &s;he had received no other material injury. The lo&s;s of her &s;heathing alone was a great misfortune, as the worm would now be let into her bottom, which might expo&s;e us to great inconvenience and danger; but as I knew no remedy for the mi&s;chief but heaving her down, which would be a work of immen&s;e labour and long time, if practicable at ail in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, I was obliged to be content. The carpenters however continued to work under her bottom in the evening till they were prevented by the tide; the morn|ing tide did not ebb out far enough to permit them to work at all, for we had only one tolerable high and low tide in four and twenty hours, as indeed we had experienced when we lay upon the rock. The po&s;ition of the &s;hip, which threw the water in her abaft, was very near depriving the world of all the knowlege which Mr. Banks had endured &s;o much labour, and &s;o many ri&s;ks, to procure; for he had re|moved the curious collection of plants which he made du|ring the whole voyage, into the bread room, which lies in the after part of the &s;hip, as a place of the greate&s;t &s;ecu|rity; and nobody having thought of the danger to which laying her head &s;o much higher than the &s;tern would ex|po&s;e them, they were this day found under water. Mo&s;t of them however were, by indefatigable care and attention,

<P>The 25th was employed in filling water and over-hauling the rigging,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 25.</NOTE> and at low water the carpenters fini&s;hed the repairs under the larboard bow, and every other place which the tide would permit them to come at; &s;ome ca&s;ks were then la&s;hed under her bows to facilitate her floating, and at night, when it was high water, we endeavoured to heave her off, but without &s;ucce&s;s, for &s;ome of the ca&s;ks that were la&s;hed to her gave way.</P>
<P>The morning of the 26th was employed in getting more ca&s;ks ready for the &s;ame purpo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 26.</NOTE> and in the afternoon we la&s;hed no le&s;s than eight and thirty under the &s;hip's bottom, but to our great mortification the&s;e al&s;o proved ineffectual, and we found our&s;elves reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of waiting till the next &s;pring-tide.</P>
<P>This day, &s;ome of our gentlemen who had made an excur|&s;ion into the woods, brought home the leaves of a plant, which was thought to be the &s;ame that in the We&s;t Indies is called coccos, but upon trial, the roots proved too acrid to be eaten; the leaves however were little inferior to &s;pinnage. In the place where the&s;e plants were gathered, grew plenty of the cabbage traces which have occa&s;ionally been men|tioned before, a kind of wild plantain, the fruit of which was &s;o full of &s;tones as &s;carcely to be eatable; another fruit was al&s;o found about the &s;ize of a &s;mall golden pippin, but flatter, and of a deep purple colour: when fir&s;t gathered from the tree it was very hard and di&s;agreeable, but after being kept a few days became &s;oft, and ta&s;ted very much like an indifferent dama&s;cene.</P>
<P>The next morning we began to move &s;ome of the weight from the after-part of the &s;hip forward, to ea&s;e her;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 27.</NOTE> in the mean time the armourer continued to work at the forge, the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 28.</NOTE>On the 28th, Mr. Banks went with &s;ome of the &s;eamen up the country, to &s;hew them the plant which in the We&s;t Indies is called Indian kalc, and which &s;erved us for greens. Tu|pia had much meliorated the root of the coccos, by giving them a long dre&s;&s;ing in his country oven, but they were &s;o &s;mall that we did not think them an object for the &s;hip. In their walk they found one tree which had been notched for the convenience of climbing it, in the &s;ame manner with tho&s;e we had &s;een in Botany Bay: they &s;aw al&s;o many ne&s;ts of white ants, which re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t Indies, the mo&s;t pernicious in&s;ects in the world. The ne&s;ts were of a pyramidical figure, from a few inches to &s;ix feet high, and very much re&s;embled the &s;tones in England, which are &s;aid to be monuments of the Druids. Mr. Gore, who was al&s;o this day four or five miles up the country, reported that he had &s;een the foot&s;teps of men, and tracked animals of three or four different &s;orts, but had not been fortunate enough to &s;ee either man or bea&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 29.</NOTE>At two o'clock in the morning of the 29th, I ob&s;erved, in conjunction with Mr. Green, an emer&s;ion of Jupiter's fir&s;t &s;atellite; the time here was 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 18&prime; 53&Prime;, which gave the lon|gitude of this place 214&deg; 42&prime; 30&Prime; W.: its latitude is 15&deg; 26&prime; S. At break of day, I &s;ent the boat out again with the &s;eine, and in the afternoon, it returned with as much fi&s;h as enabled me to give every man a pound and an half. One of my mid&s;hipmen, an American, who was this day abroad with his gun, reported that he had &s;een a wolf, exactly like tho&s;e
<PB N="565" REF="169">
which he had been u&s;ed to &s;ee in his own country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. June.</NOTE> and that he had &s;hot at it, but did not kill it.</P>
<P>The next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 30.</NOTE> encouraged by the &s;ucce&s;s of the day before, I &s;ent the boat again to haul the &s;eine, and another party to gather greens: I &s;ent al&s;o &s;ome of the young gen|tlemen to take a plan of the harbour, and went my&s;elf upon a hill, which lies over the &s;outh point, to take a view of the &s;ea. At this time it was low water, and I &s;aw, with great concern, innumerable &s;and banks and &s;hoals lying all along the coa&s;t in every direction. The innermo&s;t lay about three or four miles from the &s;hore, the outermo&s;t extended as far as I could &s;ee with my gla&s;s, and many of them did but ju&s;t ri&s;e above water. There was &s;ome appearance of a pa&s;&s;age to the northward, and I had no hope of getting clear but in that direction, for as the wind blows con&s;tantly from the S.E. it would have been difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to return back to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>Mr. Gore reported, that he had this day &s;een two animals like dogs, of a &s;traw colour, that they ran like a hare, and were about the &s;ame &s;ize. In the afternoon, the people re|turned from hauling the &s;eine, with &s;till better &s;ucce&s;s than before, for I was now able to di&s;tribute two pounds and an half to each man: the greens that had been gathered I or|dered to be boiled among the peas, and they made an excel|lent me&s;s, which, with two copious &s;upplies of fi&s;h, afforded us un&s;peakable refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>The next day, July the 1&s;t, being Sunday,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July. Sunday 1.</NOTE> every body had liberty to go a&s;hore, except one from each me&s;s, who were again &s;ent out with the &s;eine. The &s;eine was again equally &s;ucce&s;sful, and the people who went up the country gave an account of having &s;een &s;everal animals, though none of them were to be caught. They &s;aw a fire al&s;o about a mile
<PB N="566" REF="170">
up the river,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Sunday 1.</NOTE> and Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, picked up the hu&s;k of a cocoa nut, which had been ca&s;t upon the beach, and was full of barnacles: this probably might come from &s;ome i&s;land to windward, perhaps from the Terra del E&s;pirito Santo of Quiros, as we were now in the latitude where it is &s;aid to lie. This day the thermometer in the &s;hade ro&s;e to 87, which was higher than it had been on any day &s;ince we came upon this coa&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 2.</NOTE>Early the next morning, I &s;ent the Ma&s;ter in the pinnace, out of the harbour, to &s;ound about the &s;hoals in the offing, and look for a channel to the northward: at this time we had a breeze from the land, which continued till about nine o'clock, and was the fir&s;t we had had &s;ince our coming into the river. At low water we la&s;hed &s;ome empty ca&s;ks under the &s;hip's bows, having &s;ome hope that as the tides were ri&s;ing &s;he would float the next high water. We &s;till conti|nued to fi&s;h with great &s;ucce&s;s, and at high water we again attempted to heave the &s;hip off, but our utmo&s;t efforts were &s;till ineffectual.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 3.</NOTE>The next day at noon, the Ma&s;ter returned, and reported, that he had found a pa&s;&s;age out to &s;ea between the &s;hoals, and de&s;cribed its &s;ituation. The &s;hoals, he &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ted of coral rocks, many of which were dry at low water, and upon one of which he had been a&s;hore. He found here &s;ome cockles of &s;o enormous a &s;ize that one of them was more than two men could eat, and a great variety of other &s;hell-fi&s;h, of which he brought us a plentiful &s;upply: in the even|ing, he had al&s;o landed in a bay about three leagues to the northward of our &s;tation, where he di&s;turbed &s;ome of the na|tives who were at &s;upper: they all fled with the greate&s;t pre|cipitation at his approach, leaving &s;ome fre&s;h &s;ea eggs, and a fire ready kindled behind them, but there was neither
<PB N="567" REF="171">
hou&s;e nor hovel near the place. We ob&s;erved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Tue&s;day 3.</NOTE> that although the &s;hoals that lie ju&s;t within &s;ight of the coa&s;t, abound with &s;hell-fi&s;h, which may be ea&s;ily caught at low water; yet we &s;aw no &s;uch &s;hells about the fire places on &s;hore. This day an allegator was &s;een to &s;wim about the &s;hip for &s;ome time, and at high water we made another effort to float her, which happily &s;ucceeded: we found however that by lying &s;o long with her head a-ground, and her &s;tern a-float, &s;he had &s;prung a plank between decks, a-brea&s;t of the main chains, &s;o that it was become nece&s;&s;ary to lay her a&s;hore again.</P>
<P>The next morning was employed in trimming her upon an even keel, and in the afternoon, having warped her over,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 4.</NOTE> and waited for high water, we laid her a&s;hore on the &s;and bank on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river, for the damage &s;he had received already from the great de&s;cent of the ground, made me afraid to lay her broad-&s;ide to the &s;hore in the &s;ame place from which we had ju&s;t floated her. I was now very de&s;irous to make another trial to come at her bottom, where the &s;heathing had been rubbed off, but though &s;he had &s;carcely four feet water under her, when the tide was out, yet that part was not dry.</P>
<P>On the 5th, I got one of the carpenter's crew,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 5.</NOTE> a man in whom I could confide, to go down again to the &s;hip's bot|tom, and examine the place. He reported, that three &s;treaks of the &s;heathing, about eight feet long, were wanting, and that the main plank had been a little rubbed; this ac|count perfectly agreed with the report of the Ma&s;ter, and others, who had been under her bottom before: I had the comfort however to find the carpenter of opinion that this would be of little con&s;equence, and therefore the other da|mage being repaired, &s;he was again floated at high water, and moored along-&s;ide the beach, where the &s;tores had been
<PB N="568" REF="172">
depo&s;ited;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Thur&s;day 5.</NOTE> we then went to work to take the &s;tores on board, and put her in a condition for the &s;ea. This day, Mr. Banks cro&s;&s;ed to the other &s;ide of the harbour, where, as he walked along a &s;andy beach, he found innumerable fruits, and many of them &s;uch as no plants which he had di&s;covered in this country produced: among others were &s;ome cocoa nuts, which Tupia &s;aid had been opened by a kind of crab, which from his de&s;cription we judged to be the &s;ame that the Dutch call <HI>Beurs Krabbe,</HI> and which we had not &s;een in the&s;e &s;eas. All the vegetable &s;ub&s;tances which he found in this place, were encru&s;ted with marine productions, and covered with barnacles; a &s;ure &s;ign that they mu&s;t have come far by &s;ea, and, as the trade-wind blows right upon the &s;hore, probably from Terra del E&s;pirito Santo, which has been mentioned already.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 6.</NOTE>The next morning, Mr. Banks, with Lieutenant Gore, and three men, &s;et out in a &s;mall boat up the river, with a view to &s;pend two or three days in an excur&s;ion, to examine the country, and kill &s;ome of the animals which had been &s;o often &s;een at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 7.</NOTE>On the 7th, I &s;ent the Ma&s;ter again out to &s;ound about the &s;hoals, the account which he had brought me of a channel being by no means &s;atisfactory; and we &s;pent the remainder of this day, and the morning of the next, in fi&s;hing, and other nece&s;&s;ary occupations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 8.</NOTE>About four o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Banks and his party returned, and gave us an account of their expedition. Having proceeded about three leagues among &s;wamps and mangroves, they went up into the country, which they found to differ but little from what they had &s;een before: they pur&s;ued their cour&s;e therefore up the river, which at length was contracted into a narrow channel, and was bounded, not by &s;wamps and mangroves, but by &s;teep
<PB N="569" REF="173">
banks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Sunday 8.</NOTE> that were covered with trees of a mo&s;t beautiful ver|dure, among which was that which in the We&s;t Indies is called <HI>Mohoe,</HI> or the bark tree, the <HI>hibi&s;cus tiliaceus</HI>; the land within was in general low, and had a thick covering of long gra&s;s: the &s;oil &s;eemed to be &s;uch as promi&s;ed great fertility, to any who &s;hould plant and improve it. In the cour&s;e of the day, Tupia &s;aw an animal, which, by his de&s;cription, Mr. Banks judged to be a wolf: they al&s;o &s;aw three other animals, but could neither catch nor kill one of them, and a kind of bat, as large as a partridge, but this al&s;o eluded all their diligence and &s;kill. At night, they took up their lodg|ing clo&s;e to the banks of the river, and made a fire, but the mu&s;quitos &s;warmed about them in &s;uch numbers, that their quarters were almo&s;t untenable; they followed them into the &s;moke, and almo&s;t into the fire, which, hot as the cli|mate was, they could better endure than the &s;tings of the&s;e in&s;ects, which were an intolerable torment. The fire, the flies, and the want of a better bed than the ground, ren|dered the night extremely uncomfortable, &s;o that they pa&s;&s;ed it not in &s;leep, but in re&s;tle&s;s wi&s;hes for the return of day. With the fir&s;t dawn they &s;et out in &s;earch of game, and in a walk of many miles, they &s;aw four animals of the &s;ame kind, two of which Mr. Banks's greyhound fairly chaced, but they threw him out at a great di&s;tance, by leaping over the long thick gra&s;s, which prevented his running: this animal was ob&s;erved not to run upon four legs, but to bound or hop forward upon two, like the <HI>Jerbua,</HI> or <HI>Mus Jaculus.</HI> About noon, they returned to the boat, and again proceeded up the river, which was &s;oon contracted into a fre&s;h water brook, where, however, the tide ro&s;e to a con&s;iderable height: as evening approached, it became low water, and it was then &s;o &s;hallow that they were obliged to get out of the boat and drag her along, till they could find a place in
<PB N="570" REF="174">
which they might,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Sunday 8.</NOTE> with &s;ome hope of re&s;t, pa&s;s the night. Such a place at length offered, and while they were getting the things out of the boat, they ob&s;erved a &s;moke at the di&s;tance of about a furlong: as they did not doubt but that &s;ome of the natives, with whom they had &s;o long and earne&s;tly de|&s;ired to become per&s;onally acquainted, were about the fire, three of the party went immediately towards it, hoping that &s;o &s;mall a number would not put them to flight: when they came up to the place, however, they found it de&s;erted, and therefore they conjectured that before they had di&s;covered the Indians, the Indians had di&s;covered them. They found the fire &s;till burning, in the hollow of an old tree that was become touch-wood, and &s;everal branches of trees newly broken down, with which children appeared to have been playing: they ob&s;erved al&s;o many foot-&s;teps upon the &s;and, below high water mark, which were certain indications that the Indians had been recently upon the &s;pot. Several hou&s;es were found at a little di&s;tance, and &s;ome ovens dug in the ground, in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e of Otaheite, in which victuals appeared to have been dre&s;&s;ed &s;ince the morning, and, &s;cattered about them, lay &s;ome &s;hells of a kind of clamm, and &s;ome fragments of roots, the refu&s;e of the meal. After regretting their di&s;appointment, they repaired to their quarters, which was a broad &s;and bank, under the &s;helter of a bu&s;h. Their beds were plantain leaves, which they &s;pread upon the &s;and, and which were as &s;oft as a mat|tre&s;s; their cloaks &s;erved them for bed-clothes, and &s;ome bunches of gra&s;s for pillows: with the&s;e accommodations they hoped to pa&s;s a better night than the la&s;t, e&s;pecially as, to their great comfort, not a mu&s;quito was to be &s;een. Here then they lay down, and, &s;uch is the force of habit, they re&s;igned them&s;elves to &s;leep, without once reflecting upon the probability and danger of being found by the Indians in
<PB N="571" REF="175">
that &s;ituation. If this appears &s;trange,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Sunday 8.</NOTE> let us for a moment reflect, that every danger, and every calamity, after a time becomes familiar, and lo&s;es its effect upon the mind. If it were po&s;&s;ible that a man &s;hould fir&s;t be made acquainted with his mortality, or even with the inevitable debility and infir|mities of old age, when his under&s;tanding had arrived at its full &s;trength, and life was endeared by the enjoyments of youth, and vigour, and health, with what an agony of ter|ror and di&s;tre&s;s would the intelligence be received! yet, being gradually acquainted with the&s;e mournful truths, by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, we &s;carce know when, they lo&s;e all their force, and we think no more of the approach of old age and death, than the&s;e wanderers of an unknown de&s;art did of a le&s;s obvious and certain evil, the approach of the native &s;a|vages, at a time when they mu&s;t have fallen an ea&s;y prey to their malice or their fears. And it is remarkable, that the greater part of tho&s;e who have been condemned to &s;uffer a violent death, have &s;lept the night immediately preceding their execution, though there is perhaps no in&s;tance of a per&s;on accu&s;ed of a capital crime having &s;lept the fir&s;t night of his confinement. Thus is the evil of life in &s;ome degree a remedy for it&s;elf, and though every man at twenty depre|cates four&s;core, almo&s;t every man is as tenacious of life at four&s;core as at twenty; and if he does not &s;uffer under any painful di&s;order, lo&s;es as little of the comforts that remain by reflecting that he is upon the brink of the grave, where the earth already crumbles under his feet, as he did of the plea&s;ures of his better days, when his di&s;&s;olution, though certain, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be at a di&s;tance.</P>

<P>Soon after the arrival of this party, the Ma&s;ter al&s;o re|turned, having been &s;even leagues out to &s;ea, and he was now of opinion, that there was no getting out where before he thought there had been a pa&s;&s;age; his expedition how|ever was by no means without its advantage, for having been a &s;econd time upon the rock where he had &s;een the large cockles, he met with a great number of turtle, three of which he caught, that together weighed &s;even hundred and ninety-one pounds, though he had no better in&s;trument than a boat hook.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 9.</NOTE>The next morning therefore, I &s;ent him out again, with proper in&s;truments for taking them, and Mr. Banks went with him, but the &s;ucce&s;s did not at all an&s;wer our expecta|tions, for, by the unaccountable conduct of the officer, not a &s;ingle turtle was taken, nor could he be per&s;uaded to re|turn: Mr. Banks, however, went a&s;hore upon the reef, where he &s;aw &s;everal of the large cockles, and having collected many &s;hells, and marine productions, he returned at eleven o'clock at night, in his own &s;mall boat, the Ma&s;ter &s;till con|tinuing with the large one upon the rock. In the after|noon, &s;even or eight of the natives had appeared on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river, and two of them came down to the &s;andy point, oppo&s;ite to the &s;hip; but upon &s;eeing me put off in a boat to &s;peak with them, they all ran away with the greate&s;t precipitation.</P>
<P>As the Ma&s;ter continued ab&s;ent with the boat all night, I was forced to &s;end the Second Lieutenant for him, early the next morning in the yawl;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 10.</NOTE> and &s;oon after four of the natives appeared upon the &s;andy point, on the north &s;ide of the river, having with them a &s;mall wooden canoe, with out|riggers:
<PB N="573" REF="177">
they &s;eemed for &s;ome time to be bu&s;ily employed in &s;triking fi&s;h:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Tue&s;day 10.</NOTE> &s;ome of our people were for going over to them in a boat, but this I would by no means permit, re|peated experience having convinced me that it was more likely to prevent, than procure an interview. I was deter|mined to try what could be done by a contrary method, and accordingly let them alone, without appearing to take the lea&s;t notice of them: this &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that at length two of them came in the canoe within a mu&s;ket &s;hot of the &s;hip, and there talked a great deal in a very loud tone: we under&s;tood nothing that they &s;aid, and therefore could an&s;wer their harangue only by &s;houting, and making all the &s;igns of invitation and kindne&s;s that we could devi&s;e. During this conference, they came, in&s;en&s;ibly, nearer and nearer, holding up their lances, not in a threatening man|ner, but as if to intimate that if we offered them any injury, they had weapons to revenge it. When they were almo&s;t along-&s;ide of us, we threw them &s;ome cloth, nails, beads, paper, and other trifles, which they received without the lea&s;t appearance of &s;atisfaction: at la&s;t, one of the people happened to throw them a &s;mall fi&s;h; at this they expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t joy imaginable, and intimating, by &s;igns, that they would fetch their companions, immediately paddled away towards the &s;hore. In the mean time &s;ome of our people, and among them Tupia, landed on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river: the canoe, with all the four Indians, very &s;oon returned to the &s;hip, and came quite along-&s;ide, without ex|pre&s;&s;ing any fear or di&s;tru&s;t. We di&s;tributed &s;ome more pre&s;ents among them, and &s;oon after they left us, and landed on the &s;ame &s;ide of the river where our people had gone a&s;hore: every man carried in his hand two lances, and a &s;tick, which is u&s;ed in throwing them, and advanced to

the place where Tupia and the re&s;t of our people were &s;itting;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Tue&s;day 10.</NOTE> Tupia &s;oon prevailed upon them to lay down their arms, and come forward without them: he then made &s;igns that they &s;hould &s;it down by him, with which they complied, and &s;eemed to be under no apprehen&s;ion or con&s;traint: &s;everal more of us then going a&s;hore, they expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome jealou&s;y le&s;t we &s;hould get between them and their arms; we took care however to &s;hew them that we had no &s;uch intention, and having joined them, we made them &s;ome more pre|&s;ents, as a farther te&s;timony of our good-will, and our de&s;ire to obtain theirs. We continued together, with the utmo&s;t cordiality, till dinner time, and then giving them to under|&s;tand that we were going to eat, we invited them, by &s;igns, to go with us: this however they declined, and as &s;oon as we left them, they went away in their canoe. One of the&s;e men was &s;omewhat above the middle age, the other three were young; they were in general of the common &s;tature, but their limbs were remarkably &s;mall; their &s;kin was of the colour of wood &s;oot, or what would be called a dark cho|colate colour; their hair was black, but not woolly; it was &s;hort cropped, in &s;ome lank, and in others curled. Dampier &s;ays, that the people whom he &s;aw on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of this country, wanted two of their fore-teeth, but the&s;e had no &s;uch defect: &s;ome part of their bodies had been painted red, and the upper lip and brea&s;t of one of them was painted with &s;treaks of white, which he called <HI>Carbanda</HI>; their fea|tures were far from di&s;agreeable, their eyes were lively, and their teeth even and white, their voices were &s;oft and tune|able, and they repeated many words after us with great fa|cility. In the night, Mr. Gore and the Ma&s;ter returned with the long-boat, and brought one turtle and a few &s;hell-fi&s;h. The yawl had been left upon the &s;hoal with &s;ix men, to make a farther trial for turtle.</P>
<P><PB N="575" REF="179">The next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Wedne&s;. 11.</NOTE> we had another vi&s;it from four of the natives; three of them had been with us before, but the fourth was a &s;tranger, who&s;e name, as we learnt from his companions who introduced him, was YAPARICO. This gentleman was di&s;tingui&s;hed by an ornament of a very &s;trik|ing appearance: it was the bone of a bird, nearly as thick as a man's finger, and five or &s;ix inches long, which he had thru&s;t into a hole, made in the gri&s;tle that divides the no&s;trils; of this we had &s;een one in&s;tance, and only one, in New Zealand; but upon examination, we found that among all the&s;e people this part of the no&s;e was perforated, to re|ceive an ornament of the &s;ame kind: they had al&s;o holes in their ears, though nothing was then hanging to them, and had bracelets upon the upper part of their arms, made of plaited hair, &s;o that, like the inhabitants of Terra del Fuego, they &s;eem to be fond of ornament, though they are ab&s;o|lutely without apparel; and one of them, to whom I had given part of an old &s;hirt, in&s;tead of throwing it over any part of his body, tied it as a fillet round his head. They brought with them a fi&s;h, which they gave us, as we &s;up|po&s;ed, in return for the fi&s;h that we had given them the day before. They &s;eemed to be much plea&s;ed, and in no ha&s;te to leave us, but &s;eeing &s;ome of our gentlemen examine their canoe with great curio&s;ity and attention, they were alarmed, and jumping immediately into it, paddled away without &s;peaking a word.</P>
<P>About two the next morning, the yawl,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 12.</NOTE> which had been left upon the &s;hoal, returned, with three turtles and a large &s;keat. As it &s;eemed now probable that this fi&s;hery might be pro&s;ecuted with advantage, I &s;ent her out again, after break|fa&s;t, for a further &s;upply. Soon after, three Indians ven|tured down to Tupia's tent, and were &s;o well plea&s;ed with their reception, that one of them went with the canoe to
<PB N="576" REF="180">
fetch two others whom we had never &s;een:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Thur&s;day 12.</NOTE> when he re|turned, he introduced the &s;trangers by name, a ceremony which, upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, was never omitted. As they had received the fi&s;h that was thrown into their canoe, when they fir&s;t approached the &s;hip, with &s;o much plea&s;ure, &s;ome fi&s;h was offered to them now, and we were greatly &s;urprized to &s;ee that it was received with the greate&s;t indifference: they made &s;igns, however, to &s;ome of the people, that they &s;hould dre&s;s it for them, which was immediately done, but after eating a little of it, they threw the re&s;t to Mr. Banks's dog. They &s;taid with us all the forenoon, but would never venture above twenty yards from their canoe. We now per|ceived that the colour of their &s;kin was not &s;o dark as it ap|peared, what we had taken for their complexion, being the effects of dirt and &s;moke, in which, we imagined, they con|trived to &s;leep, notwith&s;tanding the heat of the climate, as the only means in their power to keep off the mu&s;quitos. Among other things that we had given them when we fir&s;t &s;aw them, were &s;ome medals, which we had hung round their necks by a riband; and the&s;e ribands were &s;o changed by &s;moke, that we could not ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h of what colour they had been: this incident led us more narrowly to ex|amine the colour of their &s;kin. While the&s;e people were with us, we &s;aw two others on the point of land that lay on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, at the di&s;tance of about two hundred yards, and by our gla&s;&s;es di&s;covered them to be a woman and a boy; the woman, like the re&s;t, being &s;tark naked. We ob&s;erved, that all of them were remarkably clean-limbed, and exceedingly active and nimble. One of the&s;e &s;trangers had a necklace of &s;hells, very prettily made, and a bracelet upon his arm, formed of &s;everal &s;trings, &s;o as to re&s;emble what in England is called gymp: both of them had a piece of bark tied over the forehead, and were di&s;|figured
<PB N="577" REF="181">
by the bone in the no&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Thur&s;day 12.</NOTE> We thought their lan|guage more har&s;h than that of the I&s;landers in the South Sea, and they were continually repeating the word <HI>chercau,</HI> which we imagined to be a term expre&s;&s;ing admiration, by the manner in which it was uttered: they al&s;o cried out, when they &s;aw any thing new, <HI>cher, tut, tut, tut, tut!</HI> which probably had a &s;imilar &s;ignification. Their canoe was not above ten feet long, and very narrow, but it was fitted with an outrigger, much like tho&s;e of the i&s;lands, though in every re&s;pect very much inferior: when it was in &s;hallow water, they &s;et it on with poles, and when in deep, they worked it with paddles about four feet long: it contained ju&s;t four people, &s;o that the people who vi&s;ited us to-day went away at two turns. Their lances were like tho&s;e that we had &s;een in Botany Bay, except that they had but a &s;ingle point, which in &s;ome of them was the &s;ting of the ray, and barbed with two or three &s;harp bones of the &s;ame fi&s;h: it was indeed a mo&s;t terrible weapon, and the in&s;trument which they u&s;ed in throwing it, &s;eemed to be formed with more art than any we had &s;een before. About twelve o'clock next day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 13.</NOTE> the yawl returned, with another turtle, and a large &s;ting-ray, and in the evening, was &s;ent out again.</P>
<P>The next morning, two of the Indians came on board,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 14.</NOTE> but after a &s;hort &s;tay, went along the &s;hore, and applied them&s;elves with great diligence to the &s;triking of fi&s;h. Mr. Gore, who went out this day with his gun, had the good fortune to kill one of the animals which had been &s;o much the &s;ubject of our &s;peculation: an idea of it will be&s;t be con|ceived by the cut, plate XX, without which, the mo&s;t accu|rate verbal de&s;cription would an&s;wer very little purpo&s;e, as it has not &s;imilitude enough to any animal already known, to admit of illu&s;tration by reference.

like the gerbua,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Saturday 14.</NOTE> which it al&s;o re&s;embles in its motion, as has been ob&s;erved already, but it greatly differs in &s;ize, the gerbua not being larger than a common rat, and this animal, when full grown, being as big as a &s;heep: this individual was a young one, much under its full growth, weighing only thirty-eight pounds. The head, neck, and &s;houlders, are very &s;mall in proportion to the other parts of the body; the tail is nearly as long as the body, thick near the rump, and taper|ing towards the end: the fore-legs of this individual were only eight inches long, and the hind-legs two and twenty: its progre&s;s is by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive leaps or hops, of a great length, in an erect po&s;ture; the fore-legs are kept bent clo&s;e to the brea&s;t, and &s;eemed to be of u&s;e only for digging: the &s;kin is covered with a &s;hort fur, of a dark mou&s;e or grey colour, excepting the head and ears, which bear a &s;light re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of a hare. This animal is called by the natives <HI>Kanguroo.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 15.</NOTE>The next day, our Kanguroo was dre&s;&s;ed for dinner, and proved mo&s;t excellent meat; we might now indeed be &s;aid to fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, for we had turtle in great plenty, and we all agreed that they were much better than any we had ta&s;ted in England, which we imputed to their being eaten fre&s;h from the &s;ea, before their natural fat had been wa&s;ted, or their juices changed by a diet and &s;ituation &s;o different from what the &s;ea affords them, as garbage and a tub. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e that we caught here, were of the kind called green turtle, and weighed from two to three hundred weight, and when the&s;e were killed, they were always found to be full of turtle gra&s;s, which our naturali&s;ts took to be a kind of <HI>con&s;erva:</HI> two of them were loggerheads, the fle&s;h of which was much le&s;s delicious, and in their &s;tomachs nothing was to be found but &s;hells.</P>
<P><PB N="579" REF="183">In the morning of the 16th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Monday 16.</NOTE> while the people were em|ployed as u&s;ual in getting the &s;hip ready for the &s;ea, I climbed one of the hills on the north &s;ide of the river, from which I had an exten&s;ive view of the inland country, and found it agreeably diver&s;ified by hills, vallies, and large plains, which in many places were richly covered with wood. This evening, we ob&s;erved an emer&s;ion of Jupiter's fir&s;t &s;atellite, which gave 214&deg; 53&prime; 45&Prime; of longitude. The ob&s;ervation which was made on the 29th of June gave 214&deg; 42&prime; 30&Prime;; the mean is 214&deg; 48&prime; 7&frac12;&Prime;, the longitude of this place we&s;t of Greenwich.</P>
<P>On the 17th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 17.</NOTE> I &s;ent the Ma&s;ter and one of the Mates in the pinnace to look for a channel to the northward; and I went my&s;elf with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander into the woods on the other &s;ide of the water. Tupia, who had been thither by him&s;elf, reported, that he had &s;een three Indians who had given him &s;ome roots about as thick as a man's finger, in &s;hape not much unlike a rhadi&s;h, and of a very agreeable ta&s;te. This induced us to go over, hoping that we &s;hould be able to improve our acquaintance with the natives: in a very little time we di&s;covered four of them in a canoe, who as &s;oon as they &s;aw us came a&s;hore, and, though they were all &s;tran|gers, walked up to us, without any &s;igns of &s;u&s;picion or fear. Two of the&s;e had necklaces of &s;hells, which we could not per&s;uade them to part with for any thing we could give them: we pre&s;ented them however with &s;ome beads, and after a &s;hort &s;tay they departed. We attempted to follow them, hoping that they would conduct us to &s;ome place where we &s;hould find more of them, and have an oppor|tunity of &s;eeing their women; but they made us under&s;tand, by &s;igns, that they did not de&s;ire our company.</P>
<P><PB N="580" REF="184"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Wedne&s;. 18.</NOTE>At eight o'clock the next morning, we were vi&s;ited by &s;e|veral of the natives, who were now become quite familiar. One of them, at our de&s;ire, threw his lance, which was about eight feet long: it flew with a &s;wiftne&s;s and &s;teadine&s;s that &s;urpri&s;ed us, and though it was never more than four feet from the ground, it entered deeply into a tree at fifty paces di&s;tance. After this they ventured on board, where I left them, to all appearance much entertained, and went again with Mr. Banks to take a view of the country; but chiefly to indulge an anxious curio&s;ity, by looking round us upon the &s;ea, of which our wi&s;hes almo&s;t per&s;uaded us we had formed an idea more di&s;advantageous than the truth. After having walked about &s;even or eight miles along the &s;hore to the northward, we a&s;cended a very high hill, and were &s;oon convinced that the danger of our &s;ituation was at lea&s;t equal to our apprehen&s;ions; for in whatever direction we turned our eyes, we &s;aw rocks and &s;hoals without num|ber, and no pa&s;&s;age out to &s;ea, but through the winding channels between them, which could not be navigated with|out the la&s;t degree of difficulty and danger. We returned therefore to the &s;hip, not in better &s;pirits than when we left it; we found &s;everal natives &s;till on board, and we were told that the turtles, of which we had then no le&s;s than twelve upon the deck, had fixed their attention more than any thing el&s;e in the &s;hip.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 19.</NOTE>On the 19th in the morning, we were vi&s;ited by ten of the natives, the greater part from the other &s;ide of the river, where we &s;aw &s;ix or &s;even more, mo&s;t of them women, and like all the re&s;t of the people we had &s;een in this country, they were &s;tark naked. Our gue&s;ts brought with them a greater number of lances than they had ever done before, and hav|ing laid them up in a tree, they &s;et a man and a boy to

watch them: the re&s;t then came on board,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Thur&s;day 19.</NOTE> and we &s;oon per|ceived that they had determined to get one of our turtle, which was probably as great a dainty to them as to us. They fir&s;t a&s;ked us, by &s;igns, to give them one; and being refu&s;ed, they expre&s;&s;ed, both by looks and ge&s;tures, great di&s;appointment and anger. At this time we happened to have no victuals dre&s;&s;ed, but I offered one of them &s;ome bi&s;|cuit, which he &s;natched and threw overboard with great di&s;|dain. One of them renewed his reque&s;t to Mr. Banks, and upon a refu&s;al &s;tamped with his foot, and pu&s;hed him from him in a tran&s;port of re&s;entment and indignation: having applied by turns to almo&s;t every per&s;on who appeared to have any command in the &s;hip, without &s;ucce&s;s, they &s;ud|denly &s;eized two of the turtles, and dragged them towards the &s;ide of the &s;hip where their canoe lay: our people &s;oon forced them out of their hands, and replaced them with the re&s;t. They would not however relinqui&s;h their enterpri&s;e, but made &s;everal other attempts of the &s;ame kind, in all which being equally di&s;appointed, they &s;uddenly leaped into their canoe in a rage, and began to paddle towards the &s;hore. At the &s;ame time, I went into the boat with Mr. Banks, and five or &s;ix of the &s;hip's crew, and we got a&s;hore before them, where many more of our people were already en|gaged in various employments; as &s;oon as they landed, they &s;eized their arms, and, before we were aware of their de|&s;ign, they &s;natched a brand from under a pitch kettle which was boiling, and making a circuit to the windward of the few things we had on &s;hore, they &s;et fire to the gra&s;s in their way, with &s;urpri&s;ing quickne&s;s and dexterity: the gra&s;s, which was five or &s;ix feet high, and as dry as &s;tubble, burnt with amazing fury; and the fire made a rapid progre&s;s to|wards a tent of Mr. Banks's, which had been &s;et up for Tupia when he was &s;ick, taking in its cour&s;e a &s;ow and pigs,
<PB N="582" REF="186">
one of which it &s;corched to death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July. Thur&s;day 19.</NOTE> Mr. Banks leaped into a boat, and fetched &s;ome people from on board, ju&s;t time enough to &s;ave his tent, by hauling it down upon the beach; but the &s;mith's forge, at lea&s;t &s;uch part of it as would burn, was con&s;umed. While this was doing, the Indians went to a place at &s;ome di&s;tance, where &s;everal of our people were wa&s;hing, and where our nets, among which was the &s;eine, and a great quantity of linen, were laid out to dry; here they again &s;et fire to the gra&s;s, entirely di&s;regarding both threats and entreaties. We were therefore obliged to di&s;|charge a mu&s;quet, loaded with &s;mall &s;hot, at one of them, which drew blood at the di&s;tance of about forty yards, and this putting them to flight, we extingui&s;hed the fire at this place before it had made much progre&s;s; but where the gra&s;s had been fir&s;t kindled, it &s;pread into the woods to a great di&s;tance. As the Indians were &s;till in &s;ight, I fired a mu&s;quet, charged with ball, abrea&s;t of them among the mangroves, to convince them that they were not yet out of our reach: upon hearing the ball they quickened their pace, and we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of them. We thought they would now give us no more trouble; but &s;oon after we heard their voices in the woods, and perceived that they came nearer and nearer. I &s;et out, therefore, with Mr. Banks and three or four more, to meet them: when our parties came in &s;ight of each other, they halted; except one old man, who came forward to meet us: at length he &s;topped, and having ut|tered &s;ome words, which we were very &s;orry we could not under&s;tand, he went back to his companions, and the whole body &s;lowly retreated. We found means however to &s;eize &s;ome of their darts, and continued to follow them about a mile: we then &s;at down upon &s;ome rocks, from which we could ob&s;erve their motions, and they al&s;o &s;at down at about an hundred yards di&s;tance. After a &s;hort time, the old
<PB N="583" REF="187">
man again advanced towards us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. July.

We found in this party four per&s;ons whom we had never &s;een before, who as u&s;ual were introduced to us by name; but the man who had been wounded in the attempt to burn our nets and linen, was not among them; we knew how|ever that he could not be dangerou&s;ly hurt, by the di&s;tance at which the &s;hot reached him. We made all of them pre|&s;ents of &s;uch trinkets as we had about us, and they walked back with us towards the &s;hip: as we went along, they told us, by &s;igns, that they would not &s;et fire to the gra&s;s any more; and we di&s;tributed among them &s;ome mu&s;quet balls, and endeavoured to make them under&s;tand their u&s;e and ef|fect. When they came abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, they &s;at down, but could not be prevailed upon to come on board; we therefore left them, and in about two hours they went away, &s;oon after which we perceived the woods on fire at about two miles di&s;tance. If this accident had happened a very little while &s;ooner, the con&s;equence might have been dreadful; for our powder had been aboard but a few days, and the &s;tore tent, with many valuable things which it con|tained, had not been removed many hours. We had no idea of the fury with which gra&s;s would burn in this hot climate, nor con&s;equently of the difficulty of extingui&s;hing it; but we determined, that if it &s;hould ever again be nece&s;&s;ary for

E. by S. with which we &s;tood off to &s;ea, E. by N. having the pinnace ahead, which was ordered to keep &s;ounding conti|nually. The yawl had been &s;ent to the turtle bank, to take up the net which had been left there; but as the wind fre&s;h|ened, we got out before her. A little before noon we an|chored in fifteen fathom water, with a &s;andy bottom; for I did not think it &s;afe to run in among the &s;hoals, till I had well viewed them, at low-water, from the ma&s;t-head, which might determine me which way to &s;teer: for as yet I was in doubt whether I &s;hould beat back to the &s;outhward, round all the &s;hoals, or &s;eek a pa&s;&s;age to the ea&s;tward or the north|ward, all which at pre&s;ent appeared to be equally difficult and dangerous.

<P>TO the harbour which we had now left,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Saturday 4.</NOTE> I gave the name of ENDEAVOUR RIVER. It is only a &s;mall bar harbour, or creek, which runs in a winding channel three or four leagues inland, and at the head of which there is a &s;mall brook of fre&s;h water: there is not depth of water for &s;hip|ping above a mile within the bar, and at this di&s;tance only on the north &s;ide, where the bank is &s;o &s;teep for near a quarter of a mile, that a &s;hip may lie afloat at low water, &s;o near the &s;hore as to reach it with a &s;tage, and the &s;ituation is extremely convenient for heaving down; but at low water, the depth upon the bar is not more than nine or ten feet, nor more than &s;eventeen or eighteen at the height of the tide; the difference between high and low water, at &s;pring tides, being about nine feet. At the new and full of the moon it is high water between nine and ten o'clock: it mu&s;t al&s;o be remembered, that this part of the coa&s;t is &s;o barricaded with &s;hoals, as to make the harbour &s;till more difficult of acce&s;s; the &s;afe&s;t approach is from the &s;outhward, keeping the main land clo&s;e upon the board all the way. Its &s;ituation may always be found by the latitude, which has been very accu|rately

laid down.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Saturday 4.</NOTE> Over the &s;outh point is &s;ome high land, but the north point is formed by a low &s;andy beach, which extends about three miles to the northward, where the land begins again to be high.</P>
<P>The chief refre&s;hment that we procured here, was turtle, but as they were not to be had without going five leagues out to &s;ea, and the weather was frequently tempe&s;tuous, we did not abound with this dainty: what we caught, as well as the fi&s;h, was always equally divided among us all by weight, the meane&s;t per&s;on on board having the &s;ame &s;hare as my&s;elf; and I think every commander, in &s;uch a voyage as this, will find it his intere&s;t to follow the &s;ame rule. In &s;everal parts of the &s;andy beaches, and &s;and hills near the &s;ea, we found pur&s;lain, and a kind of bean that grows upon a &s;talk, which creeps along the ground: the pur&s;lain we found very good when it was boiled, and the beans are not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, for we found them of great &s;ervice to our &s;ick: the be&s;t greens, however, that could be procured here, were the tops of the coccos, which have been mentioned al|ready, as known in the We&s;t Indies by the name of <HI>Indian kale:</HI> the&s;e were, in our opinion, not much inferior to &s;pinnage, which in ta&s;te they &s;omewhat re&s;emble; the roots indeed are not good, but they might probably be meliorated by proper cultivation. They are found here chiefly in boggy ground. The few cabbage palms that we met with, were in general &s;mall, and yielded &s;o little cabbage that they were not worth &s;eeking.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the kanguroo, and the opo&s;&s;um that have been al|ready mentioned, and a kind of polecat, there are wolves upon this part of the coa&s;t, if we were not deceived by the tracks upon the ground, and &s;everal &s;pecies of &s;erpents; &s;ome of the &s;erpents are venomous, and &s;ome harmile&s;s:
<PB N="591" REF="196">
there are no tame animals here except dogs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Saturday 4.</NOTE> and of the&s;e we &s;aw but two or three, which frequently came about the tents, to pick up the &s;craps and bones that happened to lie &s;cattered near them. There does not indeed &s;eem to be many of any animal, except the kanguroo; we &s;carcely &s;aw any other above once, but this we met with almo&s;t every time we went into the woods. Of land fowls we &s;aw crows, kites, hawks, cockatoos of two &s;orts, one white and the other black, a very beautiful kind of loriquets, &s;ome parrots, pigeons of two or three &s;orts, and &s;everal &s;mall birds not known in Europe. The water fowls are herns, whi&s;tling ducks, which perch, and, I believe, roo&s;t upon trees, wild gee&s;e, curlieus, and a few others, but the&s;e do not abound. The face of the country, which has been occa&s;ionally men|tioned before, is agreeably diver&s;ified by hill and valley, lawn and wood. The &s;oil of the hills is hard, dry, and &s;tony, yet it produces coar&s;e gra&s;s be&s;ides wood: the &s;oil of the plains and vallies is in &s;ome places &s;and, and in &s;ome clay; in &s;ome al&s;o it is rocky and &s;tony, like the hills; in general, however, it is well clothed, and has at lea&s;t the appearance of fertility. The whole country, both hill and valley, wood and plain, abounds with ant hills, &s;ome of which are &s;ix or eight feet high, and twice as much in circumference. The trees here are not of many &s;orts; the gum tree, which we found on the &s;outhern part of the coa&s;t, is the mo&s;t common, but here it is not &s;o large: on each &s;ide of the river, through its whole cour&s;e, there are mangroves in great numbers, which in &s;ome places extend a mile within the coa&s;t. The country is in all parts well watered, there being &s;everal fine rivulets at a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other, but none in the place where we lay, at lea&s;t not during the time we were there, which was the dry &s;ea&s;on; we were however well &s;upplied with water by &s;prings, which were not far off.</P>
<P><PB N="592" REF="197"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Saturday 4.</NOTE>In the afternoon of the 4th, we had a gentle breeze at S.E. and clear weather, but as I did not intend to &s;ail till the morning, I &s;ent all the boats to the reef, to get what turtle and &s;hell fi&s;h they could. At low water, I went up to the ma&s;t-head, and took a view of the &s;hoals, which made a very threatening appearance: I could &s;ee &s;everal at a remote di&s;tance, and part of many of them was above water. The &s;ea appeared mo&s;t open to the north ea&s;t of the turtle reef, and I came to a re&s;olution to &s;tretch out that way clo&s;e upon a wind, becau&s;e if we &s;hould find no pa&s;&s;age, we could al|ways return the way we went. In the evening, the boats brought in a turtle, a &s;ting-ray, and as many large cockles as came to about a pound and a half a man, for in each of them there was not le&s;s than two pounds of meat: in the night al&s;o we caught &s;everal &s;harks, which, though not a dainty, were an acceptable increa&s;e of our fre&s;h provi&s;ion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 5.</NOTE>In the morning, I waited till half ebb before I weighed, becau&s;e at that time the &s;hoals begin to appear, but the wind then blew &s;o hard that I was obliged to remain at an|chor: in the afternoon, however, the gale becoming more moderate, we got under &s;ail, and &s;tood out upon a wind N. E. by E. leaving the turtle reef to windward, and having the pinnace &s;ounding ahead: we had not kept this cour&s;e long, before we di&s;covered &s;hoals before us, and upon both the bows; and at half an hour after four, having run about eight miles, the pinnace made the &s;ignal for &s;hoal water, where we little expected it: upon this we tacked, and &s;tood on and off, while the pinnace &s;tretched farther to the ea&s;t|ward, and night approaching, I came to an anchor in twenty fathom water, with a muddy bottom. Endeavour River then bore S. 52 W. Cape Bedford W. by N. &frac12; N. di&s;tant five leagues, the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight, which had the ap|pearance of an i&s;land, N.; and a &s;hoal, a &s;mall &s;andy part
<PB N="593" REF="198">
of which appeared above water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Sunday 5.</NOTE> bore N.

E. there was no more than four or five feet water, with rocky ground; and yet this did not appear to us in the &s;hip. In the morning of the 6th, we had a &s;trong gale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 6.</NOTE> &s;o that in&s;tead of weighing, we were obliged to veer away more cable, and &s;trike our top-gallant yards. At low water, my&s;elf, with &s;everal of the officers, kept a look-out at the ma&s;t-head, to &s;ee if any pa&s;&s;age could be di&s;covered between the &s;hoals, but nothing was in view except breakers, extending from the S. round by the E. as far as N. W. and out to &s;ea beyond the reach of our &s;ight; the&s;e breakers, however, did not ap|pear to be cau&s;ed by one continued &s;hoal, but by &s;everal, which lay detached from each other: on that which lay farthe&s;t to the ea&s;tward, the &s;ea broke very high, which made me think it was the outermo&s;t, for upon many of the&s;e within, the breakers were incon&s;iderable, and from about half ebb to half flood, they were not to be &s;een at all, which makes &s;ailing among them &s;till more dangerous, e&s;pecially as the &s;hoals here con&s;i&s;t principally of coral rocks, which are as &s;teep as a wall; upon &s;ome of them however, and ge|nerally at the north end, there are patches of &s;and, which are covered only at high water, and which are to be di&s;cerned at &s;ome di&s;tance. Being now convinced that there was no pa&s;&s;age to &s;ea, but through the labyrinth formed by the&s;e &s;hoals, I was altogether at a lo&s;s which way to &s;teer, when the weather &s;hould permit us to get under &s;ail. It was the Ma&s;ter's opinion, that we &s;hould beat back the way we came, but this would have been an endle&s;s labour, as the wind blew &s;trongly from that quarter&punc; almo&s;t without inter|mi&s;&s;ion; on the other hand, if no pa&s;&s;age could be found to

At noon, we were got between the head land and the three i&s;lands: from the head land we were di&s;tant two leagues, and from the i&s;lands four; our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 14&deg; 51&prime;. We now thought we &s;aw a clear opening before us, and hoped hat we were once more out of danger; in this hope, how|ever, we &s;oon found our&s;elves di&s;appointed, and for that rea&s;on I called the head land CAPE FLATTERY. It lies in lati|tude 14&deg; 56&prime; S. longitude 214&prime; 43&prime; W. and is a lofty promontory, making next the &s;ea in two hills, which have a third behind them, with low &s;andy ground on each &s;ide: it may however be &s;till better known by the three i&s;lands out at &s;ea: the northermo&s;t and large&s;t lies about five leagues from the Cape, in the direction of N. N. E. From Cape Flattery the land trends away N. W. and N. W. by W. We &s;teered along the &s;hore N. W. by W. till one o'clock, for what we thought the open channel, when the petty officer at the ma&s;t-head cried out that he &s;aw land ahead, extending quite round to the i&s;lands that lay without us, and a large reef between us and them: upon this I ran up to the ma&s;t-head my&s;elf, from whence I very plainly &s;aw the reef, which was now &s;o far to windward, that we could not weather it, but the land ahead, which he had &s;uppo&s;ed to be the main, appeared to me to be only a clu&s;ter of &s;mall i&s;lands. As &s;oon as I got down from the ma&s;t-head, the Ma&s;ter, and &s;ome others went up, who all in&s;i&s;ted that the land ahead was not i&s;lands, but the main, and to make their report &s;till more alarming, they &s;aid that they &s;aw breakers all round us. In this dilemma, we hauled upon a wind in for the land, and made the &s;ignal for the boat that was &s;ounding ahead to come on board, but as &s;he was far to leeward, we were obliged to edge away to take her up, and &s;oon after we came to an anchor, under a

point of the main,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Friday 10.</NOTE> in &s;omewhat le&s;s than five fathom, and at about the di&s;tance of a mile from the &s;hore. Cape Flattery now bore S. E. di&s;tant three leagues and an half. As &s;oon as the &s;hip was at anchor, I went a&s;hore upon the point, which is high, and afforded me a good view of the &s;ea coa&s;t, trend|ing away N. W. by W. eight or ten leagues, which, the wea|ther not being very clear, was as far as I could &s;ee. Nine or ten &s;mall low i&s;lands, and &s;ome &s;hoals, appeared off the coa&s;t; I &s;aw al&s;o &s;ome large &s;hoals between the main and the three high i&s;lands, without which, I was clearly of opinion there were more i&s;lands, and not any part of the main. Ex|cept the point I was now upon, which I called POINT LOOK|OUT, and Cape Flattery, the main land, to the northward of Cape Bedford, is low, and chequered with white &s;and and green bu&s;hes, for ten or twelve miles inland, beyond which it ri&s;es to a con&s;iderable height. To the northward of Point Look-out, the coa&s;t appeared to be &s;hoal and flat, for a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance, which did not encourage the hope that the channel we had hitherto found in with the land would continue. Upon this point, which was narrow, and con|&s;i&s;ted of the fine&s;t white &s;and we had ever &s;een, we di&s;covered the foot&s;teps of people, and we &s;aw al&s;o &s;moke and fire at a di&s;tance up the country.</P>
<P>In the evening, I returned to the &s;hip, and re&s;olved the next morning to vi&s;it one of the high i&s;lands in the offing, from the top of which, as they lay five leagues out to &s;ea, I hoped to di&s;cover more di&s;tinctly the &s;ituation of the &s;hoals, and the channel between them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 11.</NOTE>In the morning therefore, of the 11th, I &s;et out in the pin|nace, accompanied by Mr. Banks, who&s;e fortitude and curi|o&s;ity made him a party in every expedition, for the norther|mo&s;t and large&s;t of the three i&s;lands, and at the &s;ame time I

&s;ent the Ma&s;ter in the yawl to leeward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Saturday 11.</NOTE> to found between the low i&s;lands and the main. In my way, I pa&s;&s;ed over a reef of coral rock and &s;and, which lies about two leagues from the i&s;land, and I left another to leeward, which lies about three miles from it: on the north part of the reef, to the lee|ward, there is a low &s;andy i&s;land, with trees upon it; and upon the reef which we pa&s;&s;ed over, we &s;aw &s;everal turtle: we cha&s;ed one or two, but having little time to &s;pare, and the wind blowing fre&s;h, we did not take any.</P>
<P>About one o'clock, we reached the i&s;land, and immediately a&s;cended the highe&s;t hill, with a mixture of hope and fear, proportioned to the importance of our bu&s;ine&s;s, and the un|certainty of the event: when I looked round, I di&s;covered a reef of rocks, lying between two and three leagues without the i&s;lands, and extending in a line N. W. and S. E. farther than I could &s;ee, upon which the &s;ea broke in a dreadful &s;urf; this however made me think that there were no &s;hoals beyond them, and I conceived hopes of getting without the&s;e, as I perceived &s;everal breaks or openings in the reef, and deep water between that and the i&s;lands. I continued upon this hill till &s;un&s;et, but the weather was &s;o hazy during the whole time that I came down much di&s;appointed. After reflecting upon what I had &s;een, and comparing the intelli|gence I had gained with what I expected, I determined to &s;tay upon the i&s;land all night, hoping that the morning might be clearer, and afford me a more di&s;tinct and compre|hen&s;ive view. We therefore took up our lodging under the &s;helter of a bu&s;h which grew upon the beach, and at three in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 12.</NOTE> having &s;ent the pinnace with one of the Mates whom I had brought out with me, to &s;ound between the i&s;land and the reefs, and examine what appeared to be a channel through them, I climbed the hill a &s;econd time; but to my great di&s;appointment found the weather much more
<PB N="598" REF="203">
hazy than it had been the day before.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Sunday 12.</NOTE> About noon the pin|nace returned, having been as far as the reef, and found between fifteen and twenty-eight fathom of water; but it blew &s;o hard that the Mate did not dare to venture into one of the channels, which he &s;aid appeared to him to be very narrow: this however did not di&s;courage me, for I judged from his de&s;cription of the place he had been at, that he had &s;een it to di&s;advantage. While I was bu&s;y in my &s;urvey, Mr. Banks was attentive to his favourite pur&s;uit, and picked up &s;everal plants which he had not before &s;een. We found the i&s;land, which is vi&s;ible at twelve leagues di&s;tance, to be about eight leagues in circumference, and in general very rocky and barren. On the north we&s;t &s;ide, however, there are &s;ome &s;andy bays, and &s;ome low land, which is covered with long thin gra&s;s, and trees of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e upon the main: this part al&s;o abounded with lizards of a very large &s;ize, &s;ome of which we took. We found al&s;o fre&s;h water in two places; one was a running &s;tream, but that was a little bracki&s;h where I ta&s;ted it, which was clo&s;e to the &s;ea; the other was a &s;tanding pool, clo&s;e behind the &s;andy beach, and this was perfectly &s;weet and good. Notwith|&s;tanding the di&s;tance of this i&s;land from the main, we &s;aw, to our great &s;urprize, that it was &s;ometimes vi&s;ited by the natives; for we found &s;even or eight frames of their huts, and va&s;t heaps of &s;hells, the fi&s;h of which we &s;uppo&s;ed had been their food. We ob&s;erved that all the&s;e huts were built upon eminences, and entirely expo&s;ed to the S. E. contrary to tho&s;e which we had &s;een upon the main; for they were all built either upon the &s;ide of a hill, or under &s;ome bu&s;hes which afforded them &s;helter from the wind. From the&s;e huts, and their &s;ituation, we concluded that at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons of the year the weather here is invariably calm and fine; for the inhabitants have no boat which can navigate the &s;ea to

&s;o great a di&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Sunday 12.</NOTE> in &s;uch weather as we had from the time of our fir&s;t coming upon the coa&s;t. As we &s;aw no animals upon this place but lizards, I called it LIZARD ISLAND; the other two high i&s;lands, which lie at the di&s;tance of four or five miles from it, are comparatively &s;mall; and near them lie three others &s;maller &s;till, and low, with &s;everal &s;hoals or reefs, e&s;pecially to the S. E.: there is however a clear pa&s;&s;age from Cape Flattery to the&s;e i&s;lands, and even quite to the outward reefs, leaving Lizard I&s;land to the north we&s;t, and the others to the &s;outh ea&s;t.</P>
<P>At two in the afternoon, there being no hope of clear weather, we &s;et out from Lizard I&s;land to return to the &s;hip, and in our way landed upon the low &s;andy i&s;land with trees upon it, which we had remarked in our going out. Upon this i&s;land we &s;aw an incredible number of birds, chiefly &s;ea-fowl: we found al&s;o the ne&s;t of an eagle with young ones, which we killed; and the ne&s;t of &s;ome other bird, we knew not what, of a mo&s;t enormous &s;ize; it was built with &s;ticks upon the ground, and was no le&s;s than &s;ix and twenty feet in circumference, and two feet eight inches high. We found al&s;o that this place had been vi&s;ited by the Indians, probably to eat turtle, many of which we &s;aw upon the i&s;land, and a great number of their &s;hells, piled one upon another in different places.</P>
<P>To this &s;pot we gave the name of EAGLE ISLAND, and after leaving it, we &s;teered S. W. directly for the &s;hip, found|ing all the way, and we had never le&s;s than eight fathom, nor more than fourteen; the &s;ame depth of water that I had found between this and Lizard I&s;land.</P>
<P>When I got on board, the Ma&s;ter informed me that he had been down to the low i&s;lands, between which and the main I had directed him to found; that he judged them to lie
<PB N="600" REF="205">
about three leagues from the main;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Sunday 12.</NOTE> that without them he found from ten to fourteen fathom, and between them and the main &s;even: but that a flat which ran two leagues out from the main, made this channel narrow. Upon one of the&s;e low i&s;lands he &s;lept, and was a&s;hore upon others; and he reported, that he &s;aw every where piles of turtle-&s;hells, and fins hanging upon the trees in many places, with the fle&s;h upon them, &s;o recent, that the boat's crew eat of them: he &s;aw al&s;o two &s;pots, clear of gra&s;s, which appeared to have been lately dug up, and from the &s;hape and &s;ize of them he conjectured they were graves.</P>
<P>After con&s;idering what I had &s;een my&s;elf, and the report of the Ma&s;ter, I was of opinion that the pa&s;&s;age to leeward would be dangerous, and that, by keeping in with the main, we &s;hould run the ri&s;k of being locked in by the great reef, and at la&s;t be compelled to return back in &s;earch of another pa&s;&s;age, by which, or any other accident that &s;hould cau&s;e the &s;ame delay, we &s;hould infallibly lo&s;e our pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies, and endanger the ruin of the voyage, as we had now but little more than three months provi&s;ions on board at &s;hort allowance.</P>
<P>Having &s;tated this opinion, and the facts and appearances upon which it was founded, to the officers, it was unani|mou&s;ly agreed, that the be&s;t thing we could do would be to quit the coa&s;t altogether, till we could approach it with le&s;s danger.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 13.</NOTE>In tne morning therefore, at break of day, we got under &s;ail, and &s;tood out N.

In this channel we had from nine to fourteen fa|thom.
<PB N="601" REF="206">
At noon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Monday 13.</NOTE> the north we&s;t end of Lizard I&s;land bore E. S. E. di&s;tant one mile; our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 14&deg; 38&prime;, and our depth of water fourteen fathom. We had a &s;teady gale at S. E. and by two o'clock we ju&s;t fetched to windward of one of the channels or openings in the outer reef, which I had &s;een from the i&s;land. We now tacked, and made a &s;hort trip to the S. W. while the Ma&s;ter in the pin|nace examined the channel: he &s;oon made the &s;ignal for the &s;hip to follow, and in a &s;hort time &s;he got &s;afe out. As &s;oon as we had got without the breakers, we had no ground with one hundred and fifty fathom, and found a large &s;ea rolling in from the S. E. a certain &s;ign that neither land nor &s;hoals were near us in that direction.</P>
<P>Our change of &s;ituation was now vi&s;ible in every counte|nance, for it was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt in every brea&s;t: we had been little le&s;s than three months entangled among &s;hoals and rocks, that every moment threatened us with de&s;truc|tion; frequently pa&s;&s;ing our nights at anchor within hear|ing of the &s;urge that broke over them; &s;ometimes driving towards them even while our anchors were out, and knowing that if by any accident, to which an almo&s;t continual tempe&s;t expo&s;ed us, they &s;hould not hold, we mu&s;t in a few minutes inevitably peri&s;h. But now, after having &s;ailed no le&s;s than three hundred and &s;ixty leagues, without once having a man out of the chains heaving the lead, even for a minute, which perhaps never happened to any other ve&s;&s;el, we found our&s;elves in an open &s;ea, with deep water; and enjoyed a flow of &s;pirits which was equally owing to our late dangers and our pre&s;ent &s;ecurity: yet the very waves, which by their &s;well convinced us that we had no rocks or &s;hoals to fear, convinced us al&s;o that we could not &s;afely put the &s;ame con|fidence in our ve&s;&s;el as before &s;he had &s;truck; for the blows
<PB N="602" REF="207">
&s;he received from them &s;o widened her leaks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Monday 13.</NOTE> that &s;he ad|mitted no le&s;s than nine inches water in an hour, which, con&s;idering the &s;tate of our pumps, and the navigation that was &s;till before us, would have been a &s;ubject of more &s;eri|ous con&s;ideration, to people who&s;e danger had not &s;o lately been &s;o much more imminent.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age or channel, through which we pa&s;&s;ed into the open &s;ea beyond the reef, lies in latitude 14&deg; 32&prime; S. and may always be known by the three high i&s;lands within it, which I have called the ISLANDS OF DIRECTION, becau&s;e by the&s;e a &s;tranger may find a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age through the reef quite to the main. The channel lies from Lizard I&s;land N. E. &frac12; N. di&s;tant three leagues, and is about one third of a mile broad, and not more in length. Lizard I&s;land which is, as I have before ob&s;erved, the large&s;t and the northermo&s;t of the three, af|fords &s;afe anchorage under the north we&s;t &s;ide, fre&s;h water, and wood for fuel. The low i&s;lands and &s;hoals al&s;o which lie between it and the main abound with turtle and fi&s;h, which may probably be caught in all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, except when the weather is very tempe&s;tuous; &s;o that, all things con&s;idered, there is not perhaps a better place for &s;hips to refre&s;h at upon the whole coa&s;t than this i&s;land. And before I di&s;mi&s;s it, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that we found upon it, as well as upon the beach in and about Endeavour River, bamboos, cocoa nuts, pumice &s;tone, and the &s;eeds of plants which are not the produce of this country, and which it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e are brought from the ea&s;tward by the trade winds. The i&s;lands which were di&s;covered by Quiros, and called Au&s;tralia del E&s;piritu Santa, lie in this parallel; but how far to the ea&s;tward cannot now be a&s;certained: in mo&s;t charts they are placed in the &s;ame longitude with this country, which, as appears by the account of his voyage

<P>As &s;oon as we were without the reef, we brought to, and having hoi&s;ted in the boats, we &s;tood off and on upon a wind all night; for I was not willing to run to leeward till I had a whole day before me.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 14.</NOTE> In the morning, at day-break, Lizard I&s;land bore S. 15 E. di&s;tant ten leagues; and we then made &s;ail and &s;tood away N.N.W. &frac12; W. till nine o'clock, when we &s;tood N.W. &frac12; N. having the advantage of a fre&s;h gale at S.E. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 13&deg; 46&prime; S. and at this time we had no land in &s;ight. At &s;ix in the evening we &s;hortened &s;ail and brought the &s;hip to, with her head to the N.E.; and at &s;ix in the morning made &s;ail and &s;teered we&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 15.</NOTE> in order to get within &s;ight of the land, that I might be &s;ure not to over&s;hoot the pa&s;&s;age, if a pa&s;&s;age there was, between this land and New Guinea. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;er|vation was 13&deg; 2&prime; S., longitude 216&deg; W.; which was 1&deg; 23&prime; W. of Lizard I&s;land: at this time we had no land in &s;ight; but a little before one o'clock, we &s;aw high land from the ma&s;t-head, bearing W.S.W. At two, we &s;aw more land to the N. W. of that we had &s;een before: it appeared in hills, like i&s;lands; but we judged it to be a continuation of the main land. About three, we di&s;covered breakers between the land and the &s;hip, extending to the &s;outhward farther than we could &s;ee; but to the north we thought we &s;aw them terminate abrea&s;t of us. What we took for the end of them in this direction, however, &s;oon appeared to be only an opening in the reef; for we pre&s;ently &s;aw them again, extending north|ward beyond the reach of our &s;ight. Upon this we hauled clo&s;e upon a wind, which was now at E. S. E. and we had &s;carcely trimmed our &s;ails before it came to E. by N. which was right upon the reef, and con&s;equently made our clear|ing

it doubtful.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Wedne&s;. 15.</NOTE> At &s;un&s;et the northermo&s;t part of it that was in &s;ight bore from us N. by E. and was two or three leagues di&s;tant; this however being the be&s;t tack to clear it, we kept &s;tanding to the northward with all the &s;ail we could &s;et till midnight; when, being afraid of &s;tanding too far in this direction, we tacked and &s;tood to the &s;outhward, our run from &s;un&s;et to this time being &s;ix leagues N. and N. by E. When we had &s;tood about two miles S. S. E. it fell calm; we had &s;ounded &s;everal times during the night, but had no bot|tom with one hundred and forty fathom, neither had we any ground now with the &s;ame length of line; yet, about four in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 16.</NOTE> we plainly heard the roaring of the &s;urf, and at break of day &s;aw it foaming to a va&s;t height, at not more than a mile's di&s;tance. Our di&s;tre&s;s now returned upon us with double force; the waves which rolled in upon the reef, carried us towards it very fa&s;t; we could reach no ground with an anchor, and had not a breath of wind for the &s;ail. In this dreadful &s;ituation, no re&s;ource was left us but the boats; and to aggravate our misfortune the pinnace was under repair: the longboat and yawl however were put into the water, and &s;ent ahead to tow, which, by the help of our &s;weeps abaft, got the &s;hip's head round to the north|ward; which, if it could not prevent our de&s;truction, might at lea&s;t delay it. But it was &s;ix o'clock before this was ef|fected, and we were not then a hundred yards from the rock upon which the &s;ame billow which wa&s;hed the &s;ide of the &s;hip, broke to a tremendous height the very next time it ro&s;e; &s;o that between us and de&s;truction there was only a dreary valley, no wider than the ba&s;e of one wave, and even now the &s;ea under us was unfathomable, at lea&s;t no bottom was to be found with a hundred and twenty fathom. During this &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s the carpenter had found means to patch up the pinnace; &s;o that &s;he was
<PB N="605" REF="210">
hoi&s;ted out, and &s;ent ahead, in aid of the other boats, to tow;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Thur&s;day 16.</NOTE> but all our efforts would have been ineffectual, if, ju&s;t at this cri&s;is of our fate, a light air of wind had not &s;prung up, &s;o light, that at any other time we &s;hould not have ob&s;erved it, but which was enough to turn the &s;cale in our favour, and, in conjunction with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which was afforded us by the boats, to give the &s;hip a perceptible motion ob|liquely from the reef. Our hopes now revived; but in le&s;s than ten minutes it was again a dead calm, and the &s;hip was again driven towards the breakers, which were not now two hundred yards di&s;tant. The &s;ame light breeze however returned before we had lo&s;t all the ground it had enabled us to gain, and la&s;ted about ten minutes more. During this time we di&s;covered a &s;mall opening in the reef, at about the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile: I immediately &s;ent one of the Mates to examine it, who reported that its breadth was not more than the length of the &s;hip, but that within it there was &s;mooth water: this di&s;covery &s;eemed to render our e&s;cape po&s;&s;ible, and that was all, by pu&s;hing the &s;hip through the opening, which was immediately at|tempted. It was uncertain indeed whether we could reach it; but if we &s;hould &s;ucceed thus far, we made no doubt of being able to get through: in this however we were di&s;ap|pointed, for having reached it by the joint a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our boats and the breeze, we found that in the mean time it had become high water, and to our great &s;urprize we met the tide of ebb ru&s;hing out of it like a mill-&s;tream. We gained however &s;ome advantage, though in a manner directly con|trary to our expectations; we found it impo&s;&s;ible to go through the opening, but the &s;tream that prevented us, car|ried us out about a quarter of a mile: it was too narrow for us to keep in it longer; yet this tide of ebb &s;o much a&s;&s;i&s;ted the boats that by noon we had got an offing of near two

miles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Thur&s;day 16.</NOTE> We had, however, rea&s;on to de&s;pair of deliver|ance, even if the breeze, which had now died away, &s;hould revive, for we were &s;till embayed in the reef; and the tide of ebb being &s;pent, the tide of flood, notwith&s;tand|ing our utmo&s;t efforts, again drove the &s;hip into the bight. About this time, however, we &s;aw another opening, near a mile to the we&s;tward, which I immediately &s;ent the Fir&s;t Lieutenant, Mr. Hicks, in the &s;mall boat to examine: in the mean time we &s;truggled hard with the flood, &s;ometimes gaining a little, and &s;ometimes lo&s;ing; but every man &s;till did his duty, with as much calmne&s;s and regularity as if no danger had been near. About two o'clock, Mr. Hicks re|turned with an account that the opening was narrow and dangerous, but that it might be pa&s;&s;ed: the po&s;&s;ibility of pa&s;&s;ing it was &s;ufficient encouragement to make the attempt, for all danger was le&s;s imminent than that of our pre&s;ent &s;ituation. A light breeze now &s;prung up at E. N. E. with which, by the help of our boats, and the very tide of flood that without an opening would have been our de&s;truction, we entered it, and were hurried through with amazing ra|pidity, by a torrent that kept us from driving again&s;t either &s;ide of the channel, which was not more than a quarter of a mile in breadth. While we were &s;hooting this gulph, our &s;oundings were from thirty to &s;even fathom, very irregular, and the ground at bottom very foul.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had got within the reef we anchored in nineteen fathom, over a bottom of coral and &s;hells. And now, &s;uch is the vici&s;&s;itude of life, we thought our&s;elves happy in having regained a &s;ituation, which but two days before it was the utmo&s;t object of our hope to quit. Rocks and &s;hoals are always dangerous to the mariner, even where their &s;ituation has been a&s;certained; they are more dange|rous in &s;eas which have never before been navigated, and in
<PB N="607" REF="212">
this part of the globe they are more dangerous than in any other; for here they are reefs of coral rock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Thur&s;day 16.</NOTE> ri&s;ing like a wall almo&s;t perpendicularly out of the unfathomable deep, always overflowed at high-water, and at low-water dry in many places; and here the enormous waves of the va&s;t Southern Ocean, meeting with &s;o abrupt a re&s;i&s;tance, break, with inconceivable violence, in a &s;urf which no rocks or &s;torms in the northern hemi&s;phere can produce. The dan|ger of navigating unknown parts of this ocean was now greatly increa&s;ed by our having a crazy &s;hip, and being &s;hort of provi&s;ions and every other nece&s;&s;ary; yet the di&s;tinction of a fir&s;t di&s;coverer made us chearfully encounter every dan|ger, and &s;ubmit to every inconvenience; and we cho&s;e ra|ther to incur the cen&s;ure of imprudence and temerity, which the idle and voluptuous &s;o liberally be&s;tow upon un&s;ucce&s;s|ful fortitude and per&s;everance, than leave a country which we had di&s;covered unexplored, and give colour to a charge of timidity and irre&s;olution.</P>
<P>Having now congratulated our&s;elves upon getting within the reef, notwith&s;tanding we had &s;o lately congratulated our&s;elves upon getting without it, I re&s;olved to keep the main land on board in my future route to the northward, whatever the con&s;equence might be; for if we had now gone without the reef again, it might have carried us &s;o far from the coa&s;t, as to prevent my being able to determine, whether this country did, or did not, join to New Guinea; a que&s;tion which I was determined to re&s;olve from my fir&s;t coming within &s;ight of land. However, as I had experienced the di&s;advantage of having a boat under repair, at a time when it was po&s;&s;ible I might want to u&s;e her, I determined to remain fa&s;t at anchor, till the pinnace was perfectly re|fitted. As I had no employment for the other boats, I &s;ent them out in the morning to the reef,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 17.</NOTE> to &s;ee what refre&s;h|ments
<PB N="608" REF="213">
could be procured,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Friday 17.</NOTE> and Mr. Banks, in his little boat, accompanied by Dr. Solander, went with them. In this &s;itu|ation I found the variation by amplitude and azimuth to be 4&deg; 9&prime; E.; and at noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 12&deg; 38&prime; S. and our longitude 216&deg; 45&prime; W. The main land extended from N. 66 W. to S. W. by S. and the neare&s;t part of it was di&s;tant about nine leagues. The opening through which we had pa&s;&s;ed, I called PROVIDENTIAL CHANNEL; and this bore E. N. E. di&s;tant ten or twelve miles: on the main land with|in us was a lofty promontory which I called CAPE WEY|MOUTH; on the north &s;ide of which is a bay, which I called WEYMOOTH BAY: they lie in latitude 12&deg; 42&prime; S., longitude 127&deg; 15&prime; W. At four o'clock in the afternoon the boats re|turned with two hundred and forty pound of the meat of &s;hell-fi&s;h, chiefly of cockles, &s;ome of which were as much as two men could move, and contained twenty pounds of good meat. Mr. Banks al&s;o brought back many curious &s;hells, and <HI>Mollu&s;ca</HI>; be&s;ides many &s;pecies of coral, among which was that called the <HI>Tubipora mu&s;ica.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 18.</NOTE>At &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we got under &s;ail and &s;tood away to the N.W. having two boats ahead to direct us; our &s;oundings were very irregular, varying five or &s;ix fathom every ca&s;t, between ten and twenty-&s;even. A little before noon, we pa&s;&s;ed a low &s;andy i&s;land, which we left on our &s;tarboard &s;ide, at the di&s;tance of two miles. At noon, our latitude was 12&deg; 28&prime;, and our di&s;tance from the main about four leagues: it extended from S. by W. to N. 71 W. and &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands from N. 40 W. to 54 W. Between us and the main were &s;everal &s;hoals, and &s;ome without us, be&s;ides the main or outermo&s;t reef, which we could &s;ee from the ma&s;t-head, &s;tretching away to the N. E.

E. by N. to get round the north point of it, which we reached by four, and then edged away to the we&s;tward, and ran between the north end of this &s;hoal and another, which lies two miles to the northward of it, having a boat all the way ahead &s;ounding; our depth of water was &s;till very irregular, from twenty-two to eight fathom. At half an hour after &s;ix, we anchored in thirteen fathom: the northermo&s;t of the &s;mall i&s;lands &s;een at noon bore W. &frac12; S. di&s;tant three miles: the&s;e i&s;lands are di&s;|tingui&s;hed in the chart by the name of FORBES's ISLANDS, and lie about five leagues from the main, which here forms a high point that we called BOLT HEAD, from which the land trends more we&s;terly, and is in that direction all low and &s;andy; to the &s;outhward it is high and hilly even near the &s;ea.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the morning we got again under &s;ail,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 19.</NOTE> and &s;teered for an i&s;land which lay at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the main, and at this time bore from us N. 40 W. di&s;tant about five leagues: our cour&s;e was &s;oon interrupted by &s;hoals; how|ever, by the help of the boats, and a good look-out from the top of the ma&s;t, we got into a fair channel that led us down to the i&s;land, between a very large &s;hoal on our &s;tarboard &s;ide and &s;everal &s;mall ones towards the main: in this chan|nel we had from twenty to thirty fathom water. Between eleven and twelve o'clock we hauled round the north ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, leaving it between us and the main, from which it is di&s;tant about &s;even or eight miles. This i&s;land is about a league in circuit, and we &s;aw upon it five of the na|tives, two of whom had lances in their hands; they came down upon a point, and having looked a little while at the &s;hip, retired. To the N. W. of it are &s;everal low i&s;lands and quays, which lie not far from the main; and to the north|ward
<PB N="610" REF="215">
and ea&s;tward are &s;everal other i&s;lands and &s;hoals;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Sunday 19.</NOTE> &s;o that we were now encompa&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide: but having lately been expo&s;ed to much greater danger, and rocks and &s;hoals being grown familiar, we looked at them compara|tively with little concern. The main land appeared to be low and barren, inter&s;per&s;ed with large patches of the very fine white &s;and, which we had found upon Lizard I&s;land and different parts of the main. The boats had &s;een many turtle upon the &s;hoals which they pa&s;&s;ed, but it blew too hard for them to take any. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 12&deg;, and our longitude 217&deg; 25&prime;: our depth of water was fourteen fathom; and our cour&s;e and di&s;tance, reduced to a &s;trait line, was, between this time and the preceding noon N. 29 W. thirty two miles.</P>
<P>The main land within the i&s;lands that have been ju&s;t men|tioned forms a point, which I called CAPE GRENVILLE: it lies in latitude 11&deg; 58&prime;, longitude 217&deg; 38&prime;; and between it and Bolt Head is a bay, which I called TEMPLE BAY. At the di&s;tance of nine leagues from Cape Grenville, in the direc|tion of E. &frac12; N. lie &s;ome high i&s;lands, which I called SIR CHARLES HARDY's ISLES; and tho&s;e which lie off the Cape I called COCKBURN's ISLES. Having lain by for the boats, which had got out of their &s;tation, till about one o'clock, we then took the yawl in tow; and the pinnace having got ahead, we filled, and &s;tood N. by W. for &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands which lay in that direction; &s;uch at lea&s;t they were in appear|ance, but upon approaching them we perceived that they were joined together by a large reef: upon this we edged away N. W. and left them on our &s;tarboard hand; we &s;teered between them and the i&s;lands that lay off the main, having a clear pa&s;&s;age, and from fifteen to twenty-three fathom water. At four o'clock, we di&s;covered &s;ome low i&s;lands and
<PB N="611" REF="216">
rocks, bearing W. N. W. and &s;tood directly for them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Sunday 19.</NOTE> at half an hour after &s;ix, we anchored on the north ea&s;t &s;ide of the northermo&s;t of them, at one mile di&s;tance, and in &s;ixteen fathom. The&s;e i&s;lands lie N. W. four leagues from Cape Grenville, and from the number of birds that I &s;aw upon them, I called them BIRD ISLES. A little before &s;un-&s;et, we were in &s;ight of the main land, which appeared all very low and &s;andy, extending as far to the northward as N. W. by N. &s;ome &s;hoals, quays, and low &s;andy i&s;les &s;tretching away to the N. E.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we got again under &s;ail,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 20.</NOTE> with a fre&s;h breeze at E. and &s;tood away N. N. W. for &s;ome low i&s;lands in that direction, but were &s;oon obliged to haul clo&s;e upon a wind to weather a &s;hoal which we di&s;covered upon our larboard bow, having at the &s;ame time others to the ea&s;tward: by the time we had weathered this &s;hoal to lee|ward, we had brought the i&s;lands well upon our lee bow, but &s;eeing &s;ome &s;hoals run off from them, and &s;ome rocks on our &s;tarboard bow, which we did not di&s;cover till we were very near them, I was afraid to go to windward of the i&s;lands, and therefore brought to, and having made the &s;ig|nal for the pinnace, which was ahead, to come on board, I &s;ent her to leeward of the i&s;lands, with orders to keep along the edge of the &s;hoal, which ran off from the &s;outh &s;ide of the &s;outhermo&s;t i&s;land, &s;ending the yawl at the &s;ame time, to run over the &s;hoal in &s;earch of turtle. As &s;oon as the pin|nace had got to a proper di&s;tance, we wore, and &s;tood after her: as we ran to leeward of this i&s;land, we took the yawl in tow, &s;he having &s;een only one &s;mall turtle, and therefore made but little &s;tay upon the &s;hoal. The i&s;land we found to be a &s;mall &s;pot of &s;and, with &s;ome trees upon it, and we could di&s;cern many huts, or habitations of the natives, whom we &s;uppo&s;ed occa&s;ionally to vi&s;it the&s;e i&s;lands from
<PB N="612" REF="217">
the main,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Monday 20.</NOTE> they being only five leagues di&s;tant, to catch turtle, when they come a&s;hore to lay their eggs. We con|tinued to &s;tand after the pinnace N. N. E. and N. by E. for two other low i&s;lands, having two &s;hoals without us, and one between us and the main. At noon, we were about four leagues from the main, which we &s;aw extending to the northward, as far as N. W. by N. all flat and &s;andy. Our la|titude, by ob&s;ervation, was 11&deg; 23&prime; S. and our longitude 217&deg; 46&prime; W. our &s;oundings were from fourteen to twenty-three fa|thom; but the&s;e, as well as the &s;hoals and i&s;lands, which are too numerous to be particularly mentioned, will be be&s;t &s;een upon the chart. By one o'clock, we had run nearly the length of the &s;outhermo&s;t of the two i&s;lands in &s;ight, and finding that the going to windward of them would carry us too far from the main, we bore up and ran to leeward, where finding a fair open pa&s;&s;age, we &s;teered N. by W. in a direction parallel to the main, leaving a &s;mall i&s;land which lay between it and the &s;hip, and &s;ome low &s;andy i&s;les and &s;hoals without us, of all which we lo&s;t &s;ight by four o'clock, and &s;aw no more before the &s;un went down: at this time the farthe&s;t part of the land in &s;ight bore N. N. W. &frac12; W. and &s;oon after we anchored in thirteen fathom, upon &s;oft ground, at the di&s;tance of about five leagues from the land, where we lay till day-light.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 21.</NOTE>Early in the morning, we made &s;ail again, and &s;teered N. N. W. by compa&s;s, for the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight; and at this time, we ob&s;erved the variation of the needle to be 3&deg; 6&prime; E. At eight o'clock, we di&s;covered &s;hoals ahead, and on our larboard bow, and &s;aw that the northermo&s;t land, which we had taken for the main, was detached from it, and that we might pa&s;s between them, by running to lee|ward of the &s;hoals on our larboard bow, which were now near us: we therefore wore and brought to, &s;ending away
<PB N="613" REF="218">
the pinnace and yawl to direct us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Tue&s;day 21.</NOTE> and then &s;teered N. W. along the S. W. or in&s;ide of the &s;hoals, keeping a good look-out from the ma&s;t-head, and having another &s;hoal on our larboard &s;ide: we found however a good channel of a mile broad between them, in which we had from ten to fourteen fathom. At eleven o'clock, we were nearly the length of the land detached from the main, and there appeared to be no ob&s;truction in the pa&s;&s;age between them, yet having the long-boat a&s;tern, and rigged, we &s;ent her away to keep in &s;hore upon our larboard bow, and at the &s;ame time di&s;|patched the pinnace a-&s;tarboard; precautions which I thought nece&s;&s;ary, as we had a &s;trong flood that carried us an end very fa&s;t, and it was near high water: as &s;oon as the boats were ahead, we &s;tood after them, and by noon, got through the pa&s;&s;age. Our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was then 10&deg; 36&prime;, and the neare&s;t part of the main, which we &s;oon after found to be the northermo&s;t, bore W. 2 S. di&s;tant between three or four miles: we found the land which was detached from the main, to be a &s;ingle i&s;land, extending from N. to N. 75 E. di&s;tant between two and three miles; at the &s;ame time we &s;aw other i&s;lands at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, extending from N. by W. to W. N. W. and behind them another chain of high land, which we judged al&s;o to be i&s;lands: there were &s;till other i&s;lands, extending as far as N. 71 W. which at this time we took for the main.</P>
<P>The point of the main which forms the &s;ide of the chan|nel through which we had pa&s;&s;ed, oppo&s;ite to the i&s;land, is the northern promontory of the country, and I called it YORK CAPE. Its longitude is 218&deg; 24&prime; W. the latitude of the north point is 10&deg; 37&prime;, and of the ea&s;t point 10&deg; 42&prime; S. The land over the ea&s;t point, and to the &s;outhward of it, is rather low, and as far as the eye can reach, very flat, and of a barren ap|pearance.
<PB N="614" REF="219">
To the &s;outhward of the Cape the &s;hore forms a large open bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Tue&s;day 21.</NOTE> which I called NEWCASTLE BAY, and in which are &s;ome &s;mall low i&s;lands and &s;hoals; the land adja|cent is al&s;o very low, flat, and &s;andy. The land of the northern part of the Cape is more hilly, the vallies &s;eem to be well clothed with wood, and the &s;hore forms &s;ome &s;mall bays, in which there appeared to be good anchorage. Clo&s;e to the ea&s;tern point of the Cape are three &s;mall i&s;lands, from one of which a &s;mall ledge of rocks runs out into the &s;ea: there is al&s;o an i&s;land clo&s;e to the northern point. The i&s;land that forms the &s;treight or channel through which we had pa&s;&s;ed, lies about four miles without the&s;e, which, except two, are very &s;mall: the &s;outhermo&s;t is the large&s;t, and much higher than any part of the main land. On the north we&s;t &s;ide of this i&s;land there appeared to be good anchorage, and on &s;hore, vallies that promi&s;ed both wood and water. The&s;e i&s;lands are di&s;tingui&s;hed in the chart by the name of YORK ISLES. To the &s;outhward, and &s;outh ea&s;t, and even to the ea&s;tward and northward of them, there are &s;everal other low i&s;lands, rocks, and &s;hoals: our depth of water in &s;ailing between them and the main, was twelve, thirteen, and four|teen fathom.</P>
<P>We &s;tood along the &s;hore to the we&s;tward, with a gentle breeze at S. E. by S. and when we had advanced between three and four miles, we di&s;covered the land ahead, which, when we fir&s;t &s;aw it, we took for the main, to be i&s;lands de|tached from it by &s;everal channels: upon this we &s;ent away the boats, with proper in&s;tructions, to lead us through that channel which was next the main; but &s;oon after di&s;covering rocks and &s;hoals in this channel, I made a &s;ignal for the boats to go through the next channel to the northward, which lay between the&s;e i&s;lands, leaving &s;ome of them between us and
<PB N="615" REF="220">
the main: the &s;hip followed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Tue&s;day 21.</NOTE> and had never le&s;s than five fa|thom water in the narrowe&s;t part of the channel, where the di&s;tance from i&s;land to i&s;land was about one mile and an half.</P>
<P>At four o'clock in the afternoon, we anchored, being about a mile and a half, or two miles, within the entrance, in &s;ix fathom and a half, with clear ground: the channel here had begun to widen, and the i&s;lands on each &s;ide of us were di&s;tant about a mile: the main land &s;tretched away to the S. W. the farthe&s;t point in view bore S. 48 W. and the &s;outhermo&s;t point of the i&s;lands, on the north we&s;t &s;ide of the pa&s;&s;age, bore S. 76 W. Between the&s;e two points we could &s;ee no land, &s;o that we conceived hopes of having, at la&s;t, found a pa&s;&s;age into the Indian &s;ea; however, that I might be able to determine with more certainty, I re&s;olved to land upon the i&s;land which lies at the &s;outh ea&s;t point of the pa&s;&s;age. Upon this i&s;land we had &s;een many of the in|habitants when we fir&s;t came to an anchor, and when I went into the boat, with a party of men, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, in order to go a&s;hore, we &s;aw ten of them upon a hill: nine of them were armed with &s;uch lances as we had been u&s;ed to &s;ee, and the tenth had a bow, and a bundle of arrows, which we had never &s;een in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the natives of this country before: we al&s;o ob&s;erved, that two of them had large ornaments of mother of pearl hanging round their necks. Three of the&s;e, one of whom was the bowman, placed them&s;elves upon the beach abrea&s;t of us, and we expected that they would have oppo&s;ed our landing, but when we came within about a mu&s;ket's &s;hot of the beach, they walked lei&s;urely away. We imme|diately climbed the highe&s;t hill, which was not more than three times as high as the ma&s;t-head, and the mo&s;t barren of
<PB N="616" REF="221">
any we had &s;een.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Tue&s;day 21.</NOTE> From this hill, no land could be &s;een be|tween the S. W. and W. S. W. &s;o that I had no doubt of find|ing a channel through. The land to the north we&s;t of it con&s;i&s;ted of a great number of i&s;lands of various extent, and different heights, ranged one behind another, as far to the northward and we&s;tward as I could &s;ee, which could not be le&s;s than thirteen leagues. As I was now about to quit the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of New Holland, which I had coa&s;ted from lati|tude 38 to this place, and which I am confident no European had ever &s;een before, I once more hoi&s;ted Engli&s;h colours, and though I had already taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal parti|cular parts, I now took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole ea&s;tern coa&s;t, from latitude 38&deg; to this place, latitude 10&frac12; S. in right of his Maje&s;ty King George the Third, by the name of NEW SOUTH WALES, with all the bays, harbours, rivers, and i&s;lands &s;ituated upon it: we then fired three vollies of &s;mall arms, which were an&s;wered by the &s;ame number from the &s;hip. Having performed this ceremony upon the i&s;land, which we called POSSESSION ISLAND, we reimbarked in our boat, but a rapid ebb tide &s;etting N. E. made our return to the ve&s;&s;el very difficult and tedious. From the time of our la&s;t coming among the &s;hoals, we con&s;tantly found a moderate tide, the flood &s;etting to the N. W. and the ebb to the S. E. At this place, it is high water at the full and change of the moon, about one or two o'clock, and the water ri&s;es and falls per|pendicularly about twelve feet. We &s;aw &s;moke ri&s;ing in many places from the adjacent lands and i&s;lands, as we had done upon every part of the coa&s;t, after our la&s;t return to it through the reef.</P>
<P>We continued at anchor all night, and between &s;even and eight o'clock in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 22.</NOTE> we &s;aw three or four of the natives upon the beach gathering &s;hell-fi&s;h; we di&s;covered,
<PB N="617" REF="222">
by the help of our gla&s;&s;es, that they were women, and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Thur&s;day 23.</NOTE> like all the other inhabitants of this country, &s;tark naked. At low water, which happened about ten o'clock, we got under &s;ail, and &s;tood to the S. W. with a light breeze at E. which afterwards veered to N. by E.: our depth of water was from &s;ix to ten fathom, except in one place, where we had but five. At noon, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion I&s;land bore N. 53 E. di&s;tant four leagues, the we&s;tern extremity of the main land in &s;ight bore S. 43 W. di&s;tant between four and five leagues, and appeared to be extremely low, the &s;outh we&s;t point of the large&s;t i&s;land on the north we&s;t &s;ide of the pa&s;&s;age bore N. 71 W. di&s;tant eight miles, and this point I called CAPE CORNWALL. It lies in latitude 10&deg; 43&prime; S., longitude 219&deg; W.; and &s;ome low lands that lie about the middle of the pa&s;&s;age, which I called WALLIS's ISLES, bore W. by S. &frac12; S. di&s;tant about two leagues: our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 10&deg; 46&prime; S. We continued to advance with the tide of flood W. N. W. having little wind, and from eight to five fathom water. At half an hour after one, the pinnace, which was ahead, made the &s;ignal for &s;hoal water, upon which we tacked, and &s;ent away the yawl to &s;ound al&s;o: we then tacked again, and &s;tood after them: in about two hours, they both made the &s;ignal for &s;hoal water, and the tide being nearly at its greate&s;t height, I was afraid to &s;tand on, as running aground at that time might be fatal; I therefore came to an anchor in &s;ome|what le&s;s than &s;even fathom, &s;andy ground. Wallis's i&s;lands bore S. by W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant five or &s;ix miles, the i&s;lands to the northward extended from S. 73 E. to N. 10 E. and a &s;mall i&s;land, which was ju&s;t in &s;ight, bore N. W. &frac12; W. Here we found the flood tide &s;et to the we&s;tward, and the ebb to the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>After we had come to an anchor, I &s;ent away the Ma&s;ter in the long-boat to &s;ound, who, upon his return in the
<PB N="618" REF="223">
evening,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Thur&s;day 23.</NOTE> reported, that there was a bank &s;tretching north and &s;outh, upon which there were but three fathom, and that beyond it there were &s;even. About this time it fell calm, and continued &s;o till nine the next morning, when we weighed, with a light breeze at S. S. E. and &s;teered N. W. by W. for the &s;mall i&s;land which was ju&s;t in &s;ight, having fir&s;t &s;ent the boats ahead to &s;ound: the depth of water was eight, &s;even, &s;ix, five, and four fathom, and three fathom upon the bank, it being now the la&s;t quarter ebb. At this time, the northermo&s;t i&s;land in &s;ight bore N. 9 E. Cape Corn|wall E. di&s;tant three leagues, and Wallis's I&s;les S. 3 E. di&s;tant three leagues. This bank, at lea&s;t &s;o much as we have &s;ounded, extends nearly N. and S. but to what di&s;tance I do not know: its breadth is not more than half a mile at the utmo&s;t. When we had got over the bank, we deepened our water to &s;ix fathom three quarters, and had the &s;ame depth all the way to the &s;mall i&s;land ahead, which we reached by noon, when it bore S. di&s;tant about half a mile. Our depth of water was now five fathom, and the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight, which is part of the &s;ame chain of i&s;lands that we had &s;een to the northward from the time of our fir&s;t entering the &s;treight, bore N. 71 E. Our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 10&deg; 33&prime; S. and our longitude 219&deg; 22&prime; W.: in this &s;ituation, no part of the main was in &s;ight. As we were now near the i&s;land, and had but little wind, Mr. Banks and I landed upon it, and found it, except a few patches of wood, to be a barren rock, the haunt of birds, which had frequented it in &s;uch num|bers, as to make the &s;urface almo&s;t uniformly white with their dung: of the&s;e birds, the greater part &s;eemed to be boobies, and I therefore called the place BOOBY ISLAND. After a &s;hort &s;tay, we returned to the &s;hip, and in the mean time the wind had got to the S. W.; it was but a gentle breeze, yet it was accompanied by a &s;well from the &s;ame
<PB N="619" REF="224">
quarter, which, with other circum&s;tances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Thur&s;day 23.</NOTE> confirmed my opinion that we were got to the we&s;tward of Carpentaria, or the northern extremity of New Holland, and had now an open &s;ea to the we&s;tward, which gave me great &s;atisfaction, not only becau&s;e the dangers and fatigues of the voyage were drawing to an end, but becau&s;e it would no longer be a doubt whether New Holland and New Guinea were two &s;e|parate i&s;lands, or different parts of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The north ea&s;t entrance of this pa&s;&s;age, or &s;treight, lies in the latitude of 10&deg; 39&prime; S, and in the longitude of 218&deg; 36&prime; W. It is formed by the main, or the northern extremity of New Holland, on the S. E. and by a congeries of i&s;lands, which I called the PRINCE OF WALES's ISLANDS, to the N. W. and it is probable that the&s;e i&s;lands extend quite to New Guinea. They differ very much both in height and circuit, and many of them &s;eemed to be well clothed with herbage and wood: upon mo&s;t, if not all of them, we &s;aw &s;moke, and therefore there can be no doubt of their being inhabited; it is al&s;o probable, that among them there are at lea&s;t as good pa&s;|&s;ages as that we came through, perhaps better, though better would not need to be de&s;ired, if the acce&s;s to it, from the ea&s;tward, were le&s;s dangerous: that a le&s;s dangerous acce&s;s may be di&s;covered, I think there is little rea&s;on to doubt, and to find it little more &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary, than to determine how far the principal, or outer reef, which bounds the &s;hoals to the ea&s;tward, extends towards the north, which I would not have left to future navigators if I had been le&s;s hara&s;&s;ed by danger and fatigue, and had had a &s;hip in better condition for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To this channel, or pa&s;&s;age, I have given the name of the &s;hip, and called it ENDEAVOUR STREIGHTS. Its length from N. E. to S. W. is ten leagues, and it is about five leagues
<PB N="620" REF="225">
broad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Thur&s;day 23.</NOTE> except at the north ea&s;t entrance, where it is &s;ome|what le&s;s than two miles, being contracted by the i&s;lands which lie there. That which I called Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion I&s;land is of a moderate height and circuit, and this we left between us and the main, pa&s;&s;ing between it and two &s;mall round i&s;lands, which lie about two miles to the N. W. of it. The two &s;mall i&s;lands, which I called Wallis's I&s;lands, lie in the middle of the &s;outh we&s;t entrance, and the&s;e we left to the &s;outhward. Our depth of water in the &s;treight, was from four to nine fathom, with every where good anchorage, ex|cept upon the bank, which lies two leagues to the north|ward of Wallis's I&s;lands, where, at low water, there are but three fathom: for a more particular knowlege of this &s;treight, and of the &s;ituations of the &s;everal i&s;lands and &s;hoals on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of New Wales, I refer to the chart, where they are delineated with all the accuracy that circum&s;tances would admit; yet, with re&s;pect to the &s;hoals, I cannot pretend that one half of them are laid down, nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ible that one half of them &s;hould be di&s;covered in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle navigation: many i&s;lands al&s;o mu&s;t have e&s;caped my pencil, e&s;pecially between lati|tude 20&deg; and 22&deg;, where we &s;aw i&s;lands out at &s;ea as far as an i&s;land could be di&s;tingui&s;hed; it mu&s;t not therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed, by future navigators, that where no &s;hoal or i&s;land is laid down in my chart, no &s;hoal or i&s;land will be found in the&s;e &s;eas: it is enough that the &s;ituation of tho&s;e that appear in the chart is faithfully a&s;certained, and, in general, I have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to hope that it will be found as free from error as any that has not been corrected by &s;ub&s;equent and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ob&s;ervations. The latitudes and longitudes of all, or mo&s;t of the principal head lands and bays, may be con|fided in, for we &s;eldom failed of getting an ob&s;ervation once at lea&s;t every day, by which to correct the latitude of our
<PB N="621" REF="226">
reckoning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Thur&s;day 23.</NOTE> and ob&s;ervations for &s;ettling the longitude were equally numerous, no opportunity that was offered by the &s;un and moon being &s;uffered to e&s;cape. It would be inju|rious to the memory of Mr. Green; not to take this oppor|tunity of atte&s;ting that he was indefatigable both in making ob&s;ervations and calculating upon them; and that, by his in&s;tructions and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, many of the petty officers were enabled both to ob&s;erve and calculate with great exactne&s;s. This method of finding the longitude at &s;ea, may be put into univer&s;al practice, and may always be depended upon within half a degree, which is &s;ufficient for all nautical pur|po&s;es. If, therefore, ob&s;erving and calculating were con|&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary qualifications for every &s;ea officer, the labours of the &s;peculative theori&s;t to &s;olve this problem might be remitted, without much injury to mankind: neither will it be &s;o difficult to acquire this qualification, or put it in practice, as may at fir&s;t appear; for, with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the nautical almanack, and a&s;tronomical ephemeris, the calculations for finding the longitude will take up little more time than the calculation of an azimuth for finding the variation of the compa&s;s.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Departure from New South Wales; a particular De&s;crip|tion of the Country, its Products, and People: A Speci|men of the Language, and &s;ome Ob&s;ervations upon the Currents and Tides.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE>OF this country, its products, and its people, many par|ticulars have already been related in the cour&s;e of the narrative, being &s;o interwoven with the events, as not to ad|mit of a &s;eparation. I &s;hall now give a more full and cir|cum&s;tantial de&s;cription of each, in which, if &s;ome things &s;hould happen to be repeated, the greater part will be found new.</P>
<P>New Holland, or, as I have now called the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, New South Wales, is of a larger extent than any other coun|try in the known world that does not bear the name of a continent: the length of coa&s;t along which we &s;ailed, re|duced to a &s;trait line, is no le&s;s than twenty-&s;even degrees of latitude, amounting to near 2000 miles, &s;o that its &s;quare &s;urface mu&s;t be much more than equal to all Europe. To the &s;outhward of 33 or 34, the land in general is low and level; farther northward it is hilly, but in no part can be called mountainous, and the hills and mountains, taken to|gether, make but a &s;mall part of the &s;urface, in compari&s;on with the vallies and plains. It is upon the whole rather bar|ren than fertile, yet the ri&s;ing ground is chequered by woods and lawns, and the plains and vallies are in many places covered with herbage: the &s;oil however is frequently &s;andy,
<PB N="623" REF="228">
and many of the lawns, or &s;avannahs, are rocky and barren,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> e&s;pecially to the northward, where, in the be&s;t &s;pots, vege|tation was le&s;s vigorous than in the &s;outhern part of the country; the trees were not &s;o tall, nor was the herbage &s;o rich. The gra&s;s in general is high, but thin, and the trees, where they are large&s;t, are &s;eldom le&s;s than forty feet a&s;un|der; nor is the country inland, as far as we could examine it, better clothed than the &s;ea coa&s;t. The banks of the bays are covered with mangroves, to the di&s;tance of a mile within the beach, under which the &s;oil is a rank mud, that is al|ways overflowed by a &s;pring tide; farther in the country we &s;ometimes met with a bog, upon which the gra&s;s was very thick and luxuriant, and &s;ometimes with a valley, that was clothed with underwood: the &s;oil in &s;ome parts &s;eemed to be capable of improvement, but the far greater part is &s;uch as can admit of no cultivation. The coa&s;t, at lea&s;t that part of it which lies to the northward of 25&deg; S. abounds with fine bays and harbours, where ve&s;&s;els may lie in perfect &s;ecurity from all winds.</P>
<P>If we may judge by the appearance of the country while we were there, which was in the very height of the dry &s;ea|&s;on, it is well watered: we &s;ound innumerable &s;mall brooks and &s;prings, but no great rivers; the&s;e brooks, however, probably become large in the rainy &s;ea&s;on. Thir&s;ty Sound was the only place where fre&s;h water was not to be pro|cured for the &s;hip, and even there one or two &s;mall pools were found in the woods, though the face of the country was every where inter&s;ected by &s;alt-creeks, and mangrove land.</P>
<P>Of trees there is no great variety. Of tho&s;e that could be called timber, there are but two &s;orts; the large&s;t is the gum tree, which grows all over the country, and has been men|tioned
<PB N="624" REF="229">
already:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> it has narrow leaves, not much unlike a willow; and the gum, or rather re&s;in, which it yields, is of a deep red, and re&s;embles the <HI>&s;anguis draconis</HI>; po&s;&s;ibly it may be the &s;ame, for this &s;ub&s;tance is known to be the produce of more than one plant. It is mentioned by Dampier, and is perhaps the &s;ame that Ta&s;man found upon Diemen's Land, where he &s;ays he &s;aw <Q>Gum of the trees, and gum lac of the ground.</Q> The other timber tree is that which grows &s;omewhat like our pines, and has been particularly mentioned in the account of Botany Bay. The wood of both the&s;e trees, as I have before remarked, is extremely hard and heavy. Be&s;ides the&s;e, here are trees covered with a &s;oft bark that is ea&s;ily peeled off, and is the &s;ame that in the Ea&s;t Indies is u&s;ed for the caulking of &s;hips.</P>
<P>We found here the palm of three different &s;orts. The fir&s;t, which grows in great plenty to the &s;outhward, has leaves that are plaited like a fan: the cabbage of the&s;e is &s;mall, but exqui&s;itely &s;weet; and the nuts, which it bears in great abundance, are very good food for hogs. The &s;econd &s;ort bore a much greater re&s;emblance to the true cabbage tree of the We&s;t Indies; its leaves were large and pinnated, like tho&s;e of the cocoa-nut; and the&s;e al&s;o produced a cab|bage, which though not &s;o &s;weet as the other, was much larger. The third &s;ort, which, like the &s;econd, was found only in the northern parts, was &s;eldom more than ten feet high, with &s;mall pinnated leaves, re&s;embling tho&s;e of &s;ome kind of fern: it bore no cabbage, but a plentiful crop of nuts, about the &s;ize of a large che&s;nut, but rounder: as we found the hulls of the&s;e &s;cattered round the places where the Indians had made their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ires, we took for granted that they were fit to eat; tho&s;e however who made the ex|periment paid dear for their knowlege of the contrary, for
<PB N="625" REF="230">
they operated both as an emetic and cathartic with great violence. Still, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> we made no doubt but that they were eaten by the Indians; and judging that the con&s;titution of the hogs might be as &s;trong as theirs, though our own had proved to be &s;o much inferior, we carried them to the &s;tye; the hogs eat them, indeed, and for &s;ome time we thought without &s;uffering any inconvenience; but in about a week they were &s;o much di&s;ordered that two of them died, and the re&s;t were recovered with great difficulty. It is probable, however, that the poi&s;onous quality of the&s;e nuts may lie in the juice, like that of the ca&s;&s;ada of the We&s;t Indies; and that the pulp, when dried, may be not only whole&s;ome, but nutricious. Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;pecies of the palm, and man|groves, there were &s;everal &s;mall trees and &s;hrubs altogether unknown in Europe; particularly one which produced a very poor kind of fig; another that bore what we called a plum, which it re&s;embled in colour, but not in &s;hape, being flat on the &s;ides like a little chee&s;e; and a third that bore a kind of purple apple; which, after it had been kept a few days, became eatable, and ta&s;ted &s;omewhat like a dama&s;cene.</P>
<P>Here is a great variety of plants to enrich the collection of a botani&s;t, but very few of them are of the ae&s;culent kind. A &s;mall plant, with long, narrow, gra&s;&s;y leaves, re&s;embling that kind of bulru&s;h which in England is called the Cat's-tail, yields a re&s;in of a bright yellow colour, exactly re&s;em|bling gambouge, except that it does not &s;tain; it has a &s;weet &s;mell, but its properties we had no opportunity to di&s;cover, any more than tho&s;e of many others with which the natives appear to be acquainted, as they have di&s;tingui&s;hed them by names.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned the root and leaves of a plant re&s;embling the coccos of the We&s;t Indies, and a kind of
<PB N="626" REF="231">
bean;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> to which may be added, a &s;ort of par&s;ley and pur&s;e|lain, and two kinds of yams; one &s;haped like a rhadi&s;h, and the other round, and covered with &s;tringy fibres: both &s;orts are very &s;mall, but &s;weet; and we never could find the plants that produced them, though we often &s;aw the places where they had been newly dug up; it is probable that the drought had de&s;troyed the leaves, and we could not, like the Indians, di&s;cover them by the &s;talks.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the fruits of this country, &s;uch as they are, have been mentioned already. We found one in the &s;outhern part of the country re&s;embling a cherry, except that the &s;tone was &s;oft; and another not unlike a pine-apple in appear|ance, but of a very di&s;agreeable ta&s;te, which is well known in the Ea&s;t Indies, and is called by the Dutch <HI>Pyn Appel Boomen.</HI></P>
<P>Of the quadrupeds, I have already mentioned the dog, and particularly de&s;cribed the kanguroo, and the animal of the opo&s;&s;um kind, re&s;embling the phalanger of Buffon; to which I can add only one more, re&s;embling a polecat, which the natives call <HI>Quoll</HI>; the back is brown, &s;potted with white, and the belly white unmixed. Several of our people &s;aid they had &s;een wolves; but perhaps, if we had not &s;een tracts that favoured the account, we might have thought them little more worthy of credit than he who reported that he had &s;een the devil.</P>
<P>Of batts, which hold a middle place between the bea&s;ts and the birds, we &s;aw many kinds, particularly one which, as I have ob&s;erved already, was larger than a partridge; we were not fortunate enough to take one either alive or dead, but it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame as Buffon has de&s;cribed by the name of <HI>Rou&s;et</HI> or <HI>Rouget.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="627" REF="232">The &s;ea and other water-fowl of this country, are gulls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> &s;haggs, &s;oland gee&s;e, or gannets, of two &s;orts; boobies, nod|dies, curlieus, ducks, pelicans of an enormous &s;ize, and many others. The land-birds, are crows, parrots, paroquets, cockatoos, and other birds of the &s;ame kind, of exqui&s;ite beauty; pigeons, doves, quails, bu&s;tards, herons, cranes, hawks, and eagles. The pigeons flew in numerous flocks, &s;o that, notwith&s;tanding their extreme &s;hyne&s;s, our people frequently killed ten or twelve of them in a day: the&s;e birds are very beautiful, and cre&s;ted very differently from any we had &s;een before.</P>
<P>Among other reptiles, here are &s;erpents of various kinds, &s;ome noxious, and &s;ome harmle&s;s; &s;corpions, centipieds, and lizards. The in&s;ects are but few. The principal are the mu&s;quito, and the ant. Of the ant there are &s;everal &s;orts; &s;ome are as green as a leaf, and live upon trees, where they build their ne&s;ts of various &s;izes, between that of a man's head and his fi&s;t. The&s;e ne&s;ts are of a very curious &s;truc|ture: they are formed by bending down &s;everal of the leaves, each of which is as broad as a man's hand, and gluing the points of them together, &s;o as to form a pur&s;e; the vi&s;cus u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, is an animal juice, which Nature has enabled them to elaborate. Their method of fir&s;t bend|ing down the leaves, we had not an opportunity to ob&s;erve; but we &s;aw thou&s;ands uniting all their &s;trength to hold them in this po&s;ition, while other bu&s;y multitudes were employed within, in applying the gluten that was to prevent their re|turning back. To &s;atisfy our&s;elves that the leaves were bent, and held down by the effort of the&s;e diminutive artificers, we di&s;turbed them in their work, and as &s;oon as they were driven from their &s;tation, the leaves on which they were employed &s;prung up with a force much greater than we
<PB N="628" REF="233">
could have thought them able to conquer by any combina|tion of their &s;trength.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> But though we gratified our curio|&s;ity at their expence, the injury did not go unrevenged; for thou&s;ands immediately threw them&s;elves upon us, and gave us intolerable pain with their &s;tings, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our necks and our hair, from whence they were not ea&s;ily driven: the &s;ting was &s;carcely le&s;s painful than that of a bee; but, except it was repeated, the pain did not la&s;t more than a minute.</P>
<P>Another &s;ort are quite black, and their operations and manner of life are not le&s;s extraordinary. Their habitations are the in&s;ide of the branches of a tree, which they contrive to excavate by working out the pith almo&s;t to the extremity of the &s;lendere&s;t twig; the tree at the &s;ame time flouri&s;hing, as if it had no &s;uch inmate. When we fir&s;t found the tree, we gathered &s;ome of the branches, and were &s;carcely le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed than we &s;hould have been to find that we had prophaned a con&s;ecrated grove, where every tree, upon being wounded, gave &s;igns of life; for we were in&s;tantly covered with legions of the&s;e animals, &s;warming from every broken bough, and inflicting their &s;tings with ince&s;&s;ant violence. They are mentioned by Rumphius in his <HI>Herbarium Amboi|nen&s;e,</HI> vol. ii. p. 257.; but the tree in which he &s;aw their dwelling, is very different from that in which we found them.</P>
<P>A third kind we found ne&s;ted in the root of a plant, which grows on the bark of trees in the manner of mi&s;letoe, and which they had perforated for that u&s;e. This root is com|monly as big as a large turnip, and &s;ometimes much big|ger: when we cut it, we found it inter&s;ected by innume|rable winding pa&s;&s;ages, all filled with the&s;e animals, by which however the vegetation of the plant did not appear to
<PB N="629" REF="234">
have &s;uffered any injury.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> We never cut one of the&s;e roots that was not inhabited, though &s;ome were not bigger than a hazle-nut. The animals them&s;elves are very &s;mall, not more than half as big as the common red ant in England. They had &s;tings, but &s;carcely force enough to make them felt; they had however a power of tormenting us in an equal, if not a greater degree; for the moment we handled the root, they &s;warmed from innumerable holes, and running about tho&s;e parts of the body that were uncovered, produced a titillation more intolerable than pain, except it is increa&s;ed to great violence. Rumphins has al&s;o given an account of this bulb and its inhabitants, vol. vi. p. 120. where he mentions another &s;ort that are black.</P>
<P>We found a fourth kind, which are perfectly harmle&s;s, and almo&s;t exactly re&s;emble the white-ants of the Ea&s;t In|dies; the architecture of the&s;e is &s;till more curious than that of the others. They have hou&s;es of two &s;orts, one is &s;u&s;|pended on the branches of trees, and the other erected upon the ground: tho&s;e upon the trees are about three or four times as big as a man's head, and are built of a brittle &s;ub|&s;tance, which &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t of &s;mall parts of vegetables kneaded together with a glutinous matter, which their bo|dies probably &s;upply; upon breaking this cru&s;t, innumerable cells, &s;warming with inhabitants, appear in a great variety of winding directions, all communicating with each other, and with &s;everal apertures that lead to other ne&s;ts upon the &s;ame tree: they have al&s;o one large avenue, or covered way, leading to the ground, and carried on under it to the other ne&s;t or hou&s;e that is con&s;tructed there. This hou&s;e is gene|rally at the root of a tree, but not of that upon which their other dwellings are con&s;tructed: it is formed like an irre|gularly &s;ided cone, and &s;ometimes is more than &s;ix feet
<PB N="630" REF="235">
high,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> and nearly as much in diameter. Some are &s;maller, and the&s;e are generally flat &s;ided, and very much re&s;emble in figure the &s;tones which are &s;een in many parts of Eng|land, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be the remains of druidical antiquity. The out&s;ide of the&s;e is of well tempered clay, about two inches thick; and within are the cells, which have no open|ing outwards, but communicate only with the &s;ubterranean way to the hou&s;es on the tree, and to the tree near which they are con&s;tructed, where they a&s;cend up the root, and &s;o up the trunk and branches, under covered ways of the &s;ame kind as tho&s;e by which they de&s;cended from, their other dwellings. To the&s;e &s;tructures on the ground they probably retire in the winter, or rainy &s;ea&s;ons, as they are proof again&s;t any wet that can fall; which tho&s;e in the tree, though generally con&s;tructed under &s;ome overhanging branch, from the nature and thinne&s;s of their cru&s;t or wall, cannot be.</P>
<P>The &s;ea in this country is much more liberal of food to the inhabitants than the land; and though fi&s;h is not quite &s;o plenty here as they generally are in higher latitudes, yet we &s;eldom hauled the &s;eine without taking from fifty to two hundred weight. They are of various &s;orts; but, except the mullet, and &s;ome of the &s;hell-fi&s;h, none of them are known in Europe: mo&s;t of them are palatable, and &s;ome are very delicious. Upon the &s;hoals and reef there are incredible numbers of the fine&s;t green turtle in the world, and oy&s;ters of various kinds, particularly the rock-oy&s;ter and the pearl-oy&s;ter. The gigantic cockles have been mentioned already; be&s;ides which there are &s;ea-crayfi&s;h, or lob&s;ters, and crabs; of the&s;e however we &s;aw only the &s;hells. In the rivers and &s;alt crecks there are aligators.</P>
<P><PB N="631" REF="236">The only per&s;on who has hitherto given any account of this country or its inhabitants is Dampier, and though he is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770.

The people whom he &s;aw were indeed inhabi|tants of a part of the coa&s;t very di&s;tant from that which we vi&s;ited; but we al&s;o &s;aw inhabitants upon parts of the coa&s;t very di&s;tant from each other, and there being a perfect uni|formity in per&s;on and cu&s;toms among them all, it is rea&s;on|able to conclude, that di&s;tance in another direction has not con&s;iderably broken it.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants in this country appears to be very &s;mall in proportion to its extent. We never &s;aw &s;o many as thirty of them together but once, and that was at Botany Bay, when men, women, and children, a&s;&s;embled upon a rock to &s;ee the &s;hip pa&s;s by: when they manife&s;tly formed a re&s;olution to engage us, they never could mu&s;ter above fourteen or fifteen fighting men; and we never &s;aw a num|ber of their &s;heds or hou&s;es together that could accommo|date a larger party. It is true, indeed, that we &s;aw only the &s;ea-coa&s;t on the ea&s;tern &s;ide; and that, between this and the we&s;tern &s;hore, there is an immen&s;e tract of country wholly unexplored: but there is great rea&s;on to believe that this immen&s;e tract is either wholly de&s;olate, or at lea&s;t &s;till more thinly inhabited than the parts we vi&s;ited. It is impo&s;&s;ible that the inland country &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t inhabitants at all &s;ea|&s;ons without cultivation; it is extremely improbable that the inhabitants of the coa&s;t &s;hould be totally ignorant of arts of cultivation, which were practi&s;ed inland; and it is equally improbable that, if they knew &s;uch arts, there &s;hould be no traces of them among them. It is certain that we did not &s;ee one foot of ground in a &s;tate of cultivation in the whole country; and therefore it may well be concluded that where
<PB N="632" REF="237">
the &s;ea does not contribute to feed the inhabitants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> the coun|try is not inhabited.</P>
<P>The only tribe with which we had any intercour&s;e, we found where the &s;hip was careened; it con&s;i&s;ted of one and twenty per&s;ons; twelve men, &s;even women, one boy, and one girl: the women we never &s;aw but at a di&s;tance; for when the men came over the river they were always left be|hind. The men here, and in other places, were of a middle &s;ize, and in general well made, clean limbed, and remark|ably vigorous, active, and nimble: their countenances were not altogether without expre&s;&s;ion, and their voices were re|markably &s;oft and effeminate.</P>
<P>Their &s;kins were &s;o uniformly covered with dirt, that it was very difficult to a&s;certain their true colour: we made &s;everal attempts, by wetting our fingers and rubbing it, to remove the incru&s;tations, but with very little effect. With the dirt they appear nearly as black as a Negroe; and ac|cording to our be&s;t di&s;coveries, the &s;kin it&s;elf is of the colour of wood &s;oot, or what is commonly called a chocolate colour. Their features are far from being di&s;agreeable, their no&s;es are not flat, nor are their lips thick; their teeth are white and even, and their hair naturally long and black, it is how|ever univer&s;ally cropped &s;hort; in general it is &s;trait, but &s;ometimes it has a &s;light curl; we &s;aw none that was not matted and filthy, though without oil or grea&s;e, and to our great a&s;toni&s;hment free from lice. Their beards were of the &s;ame colour with their hair, and bu&s;hy and thick: they are not however &s;uffered to grow long. A man whom we had &s;een one day with his beard &s;omewhat longer than his com|panions, we &s;aw the next, with it &s;omewhat &s;horter, and upon examination found the ends of the hairs burnt: from this incident, and our having never &s;een any &s;harp in&s;tru|ment
<PB N="633" REF="238">
among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> we concluded that both the hair and the beard were kept &s;hort by &s;ingeing them.</P>
<P>Both &s;exes, as I have already ob&s;erved, go &s;tark naked, and &s;eem to have no more &s;en&s;e of indecency in di&s;covering the whole body, than we have in di&s;covering our hands and face. Their principal ornament is the bone which they thru&s;t through the cartilage that divides the no&s;trils from each other: what perver&s;ion of ta&s;te could make them think this a decoration, or what could prompt them, before they had worn it or &s;een it worn, to &s;uffer the pain and incon|venience that mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity attend it, is perhaps beyond the power of human &s;agacity to determine: as this bone is as thick as a man's finger, and between five and &s;ix inches long, it reaches quite acro&s;s the face, and &s;o effectually &s;tops up both the no&s;trils that they are forced to keep their mouths wide open for breath, and &s;nuffle &s;o when they at|tempt to &s;peak, that they are &s;carcely intelligible even to each other. Our &s;eamen, with &s;ome humour, called it their &s;prit&s;ail-yard; and indeed it had &s;o ludicrous an appearance, that till we were u&s;ed to it, we found it difficult to refrain from laughter. Be&s;ide this no&s;e-jewel, they had necklaces made of &s;hells, very neatly cut and &s;trung together; brace|lets of &s;mall cord, wound two or three times about the up|per part of their arm, and a &s;tring of plaited human hair about as thick as a thread of yarn, tied round the wai&s;t. Be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;ome of them had gorgets of &s;hells hanging round the neck, &s;o as to reach cro&s;s the brea&s;t. But though the&s;e people wear no clothes, their bodies have a covering be&s;ides the dirt, for they paint them both white and red: the red is commonly laid on in broad patches upon the &s;houlders and brea&s;t; and the white in &s;tripes, &s;ome narrow, and &s;ome broad: the narrow were drawn over the limbs, and the broad over the body, not without &s;ome degree of ta&s;te. The white
<PB N="634" REF="239">
was al&s;o laid on in &s;mall patches upon the face,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> and drawn in a circle round each eye. The red &s;eemed to be ochre, but what the white was we could not di&s;cover; it was clo&s;e grained, &s;aponaceous to the touch, and almo&s;t as heavy as white lead; po&s;&s;ibly it might be a kind of <HI>Steatites,</HI> but to our great regret we could not procure a bit of it to examine. They have holes in their ears, but we never &s;aw any thing worn in them. Upon &s;uch ornaments as they had, they &s;et &s;o great a value, that they would never part with the lea&s;t article for any thing we could offer; which was the more ex|traordinary as our beads and ribbons were ornaments of the &s;ame kind, but of a more regular form and more &s;howy ma|terials. They had indeed no idea of traffic, nor could we communicate any to them: they received the things that we gave them; but never appeared to under&s;tand our &s;igns when we required a return. The &s;ame indifference which prevented them from buying what we had, prevented them al&s;o from attempting to &s;teal: if they had coveted more, they would have been le&s;s hone&s;t; for when we refu&s;ed to give them a turtle, they were enraged, and attempted to take it by force, and we had nothing el&s;e upon which they &s;eemed to &s;et the lea&s;t value; for, as I have before ob&s;erved, many of the things that we had given them, we found left negli|gently about in the woods, like the playthings of children, which plea&s;e only while they are new. Upon their bodies we &s;aw no marks of di&s;ea&s;e or &s;ores, but large &s;cars in irre|gular lines, which appeared to be the remains of wounds which they had inflicted upon them&s;elves with &s;ome blunt in&s;trument, and which we under&s;tood by &s;igns to have been memorials of grief for the dead.</P>
<P>They appeared to have no fixed habitations, for we &s;aw nothing like a town or village in the whole country. Their hou&s;es, if hou&s;es they may be called, &s;eem to be formed
<PB N="635" REF="240">
with le&s;s art and indu&s;try than any we had &s;een,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> except the wretched hovels at Terra del Fuego, and in &s;ome re&s;pects they are inferior even to them. At Botany Bay, where they were be&s;t, they were ju&s;t high enough for a man to &s;it up|right in; but not large enough for him to extend him&s;elf in his whole length in any direction: they are built with pli|able rods about as thick as a man's finger, in the form of an oven, by &s;ticking the two ends into the ground, and then covering them with palm leaves, and broad pieces of bark: the door is nothing but a large hole at one end, oppo&s;ite to which the fire is made, as we perceived by the a&s;hes. Under the&s;e hou&s;es, or &s;heds, they &s;leep, coiled up with their heels to their head; and in this po&s;ition one of them will hold three or four per&s;ons. As we advanced northward, and the climate became warmer, we found the&s;e &s;heds &s;till more &s;light: they were built, like the others, of twigs, and covered with bark; but none of them were more than four feet deep, and one &s;ide was intirely open: the clo&s;e &s;ide was always op|po&s;ed to the cour&s;e of the prevailing wind, and oppo&s;ite to the open &s;ide was the fire, probably more as a defence from the mu&s;quitos than the cold. Under the&s;e hovels it is pro|bable, that they thru&s;t only their heads and the upper part of their bodies, extending their feet towards the fire. They were &s;et up occa&s;ionally by a wandering hord, in any place that would furni&s;h them for a time with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and left behind them when, after it was exhau&s;ted, they went away: but in places where they remained only for a night or two, they &s;lept without any &s;helter, except the bu&s;hes or gra&s;s, which is here near two feet high. We ob&s;erved, how|ever, that though the &s;leeping huts which we found upon the main, were always turned from the prevailing wind, tho&s;e upon the i&s;lands were turned towards it; which &s;eems to be a proof that they have a mild &s;ea&s;on here, during which
<PB N="636" REF="241">
the &s;ea is calm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> and that the &s;ame weather which enables them to vi&s;it the i&s;lands, makes the air welcome even while they &s;leep.</P>
<P>The only furniture belonging to the&s;e hou&s;es that fell un|der our ob&s;ervation, is a kind of oblong ve&s;&s;el made of bark, by the &s;imple contrivance of tying up the two ends with a withy, which not being cut off &s;erves for a handle; the&s;e we imagined were u&s;ed as buckets to fetch water from the &s;pring, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ometimes to be at a con&s;ide|rable di&s;tance. They have however a &s;mall bag, about the &s;ize of a moderate cabbage-net, which is made by laying threads loop within loop, &s;omewhat in the manner of knitting u&s;ed by our ladies to make pur&s;es. This bag the man carries loo&s;e upon his back by a &s;mall &s;tring which pa&s;&s;es over his head; it generally contains a lump or two of paint and re&s;in, &s;ome fi&s;h-hooks and lines, a &s;hell or two, out of which their hooks are made, a few points of darts, and their u&s;ual ornaments, which includes the whole worldly trea&s;ure of the riche&s;t man among them.</P>
<P>Their fi&s;h-hooks are very neatly made, and &s;ome of them are exceedingly &s;mall. For &s;triking turtle they have a peg of wood which is about a foot long, and very well bearded; this fits into a &s;ocket at the end of a &s;taff of light wood, about as thick as a man's wri&s;t, and about &s;even or eight feet long: to the &s;taff is tied one end of a loo&s;e line about three or four fathom long, the other end of which is fa&s;tened to the peg. To &s;trike the turtle, the peg is fixed into the &s;ocket, and when it has entered his body, and is retained there by the barb, the &s;taff flies off and &s;erves for a float to trace their victim in the water; it a&s;&s;i&s;ts al&s;o to tire him, till they can overtake him with their canoes, and haul him a&s;hore. One of the&s;e pegs, as I have mentioned already, we found buried in the
<PB N="637" REF="242">
body of a turtle, which had healed up over it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> Their lines are from the thickne&s;s of a half inch rope to the finene&s;s of a hair, and are made of &s;ome vegetable &s;ub&s;tance, but what in particular we had no opportunity to learn.</P>
<P>Their food is chiefly fi&s;h, though they &s;ometimes contrive to kill the kanguroo, and even birds of various kinds; not|with&s;tanding they are &s;o &s;hy that we found it difficult to get within reach of them with a fowling-piece. The only vege|table that can be con&s;idered as an article of food is the yam; yet doubtle&s;s they eat the &s;everal fruits which have been mentioned among other productions of the country; and in|deed we &s;aw the &s;hells and hulls of &s;everal of them lying about the places where they had kindled their fire.</P>
<P>They do not appear to eat any animal food raw; but hav|ing no ve&s;&s;el in which water can be boiled, they either broil it upon the coals, or bake it in a hole by the help of hot &s;tones, in the &s;ame manner as is practi&s;ed by the inhabitants of the i&s;lands in the South Seas.</P>
<P>Whether they are acquainted with any plant that has an intoxicating quality, we do not know; but we ob&s;erved that &s;everal of them held leaves of &s;ome &s;ort con&s;tantly in their mouths, as an European does tobacco, and an Ea&s;t In|dian betele: we never &s;aw the plant, but when they took it from their mouths at our reque&s;t; po&s;&s;ibly it might be a &s;pecies of the betele, but whatever it was, it had no effect upon the teeth or the lips.</P>
<P>As they have no nets, they catch fi&s;h only by &s;triking, or with a hook and line, except &s;uch as they find in the hol|lows of the rocks and &s;hoals, which are dry at half ebb.</P>
<P>Their manner of hunting we had no opportunity to &s;ee; but we conjectured by the notches which they had every
<PB N="638" REF="243">
where cut in large trees in order to climb them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> that they took their &s;tation near the tops of them, and there watched for &s;uch animals as might happen to pa&s;s near enough to be reached by their lances: it is po&s;&s;ible al&s;o, that in this &s;itua|tion they might take birds when they came to roo&s;t.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved that when they went from our tents upon the banks of Endeavour river, we could trace them by the fires which they kindled in their way; and we imagined that the&s;e fires were intended &s;ome way for the taking the kanguroo, which we ob&s;erved to be &s;o much afraid of fire, that our dogs could &s;carcely force it over places which had been newly burnt, though the fire was extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>They produce fire with great facility, and &s;pread it in a wonderful manner. To produce it they take two pieces of dry &s;oft wood, one is a &s;tick about eight or nine inches long, the other piece is flat: the &s;tick they &s;hape into an obtu&s;e point at one end, and pre&s;&s;ing it upon the other, turn it nimbly by holding it between both their hands as we do a chocolate mill, often &s;hifting their hands up, and then moving them down upon it, to increa&s;e the pre&s;&s;ure as much as po&s;&s;ible. By this method they get fire in le&s;s than two minutes, and from the &s;malle&s;t &s;park they increa&s;e it with great &s;peed and dexterity. We have often &s;een one of them run along the &s;hore, to all appearance with nothing in his hand, who &s;tooping down for a moment, at the di&s;tance of every fifty or a hundred yards, left fire behind him, as we could &s;ee fir&s;t by the &s;moke, and then by the flame among the drift wood, and other litter which was &s;cattered along the place. We had the curio&s;ity to examine one of the&s;e planters of fire, when he &s;et off, and we &s;aw him wrap up a &s;mall &s;park in dry gra&s;s, which, when he had run a little way, having been fanned by the air that his motion produced,
<PB N="639" REF="244">
began to blaze;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> he then laid it down in a place convenient for his purpo&s;e, inclo&s;ing a &s;park of it in another quantity of gra&s;s, and &s;o continued his cour&s;e.</P>
<P>There are perhaps few things in the hi&s;tory of mankind more extraordinary than the di&s;covery and application of fire: it will &s;carcely be di&s;puted that the manner of pro|ducing it, whether by colli&s;ion or attrition, was di&s;covered by chance: but its fir&s;t effects would naturally &s;trike tho&s;e to whom it was a new object, with con&s;ternation and terror: it would appear to be an enemy to life and nature, and to tor|ment and de&s;troy whatever was capable of being de&s;troyed or tormented; and therefore it &s;eems not ea&s;y to conceive what &s;hould incline tho&s;e who fir&s;t &s;aw it receive a tran|&s;ient exi&s;tence from chance, to reproduce it by de&s;ign. It is by no means probable that tho&s;e who fir&s;t &s;aw fire, ap|proached it with the &s;ame caution, as tho&s;e who are familiar with its effects, &s;o as to be warmed only and not burnt; and it is rea&s;onable to think that the intolerable pain which, at its fir&s;t appearance, it mu&s;t produce upon ignorant curio&s;ity, would &s;ow perpetual enmity between this element and man|kind; and that the &s;ame principle which incites them to cru&s;h a &s;erpent, would incite them to de&s;troy fire, and avoid all means by which it would be produced, as &s;oon as they were known. The&s;e circum&s;tances con&s;idered, how men became &s;ufficiently familiar with it to render it u&s;eful, &s;eems to be a problem very difficult to &s;olve: nor is it ea&s;y to account for the fir&s;t application of it to culinary purpo&s;es, as the eating both animal and vegetable food raw, mu&s;t have become a habit, before there was fire to dre&s;s it, and tho&s;e who have con&s;idered the force of habit will readily believe, that to men who had always eaten the fle&s;h of animals raw, it would be as di&s;agreeable dre&s;&s;ed, as to tho&s;e who have always eaten it dre&s;&s;ed, it would be raw. It is remarkable that the inhabi|tants
<PB N="640" REF="245">
of Terra del Fuego produce fire from a &s;park by col|li&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> and that the happier natives of this country, New Zealand, and Otaheite, produce it by the attrition of one combu&s;tible &s;ub&s;tance again&s;t another: is there not then &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e different operations cor|re&s;pond with the manner in which chance produced fire in the neighbourhood of the torrid and frigid zones? Among the rude inhabitants of a cold country, neither any operation of art, or occurrence of accident, could be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o ea&s;ily to produce fire by attrition, as in a climate where every thing is hot, dry, and adu&s;t, teeming with a latent fire which a &s;light degree of motion was &s;ufficient to call forth; in a cold country therefore, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that fire was produced by the accidental colli&s;ion of two metallic &s;ub|&s;tances, and in a cold country, for that rea&s;on, the &s;ame ex|pedient was u&s;ed to produce it by de&s;ign: but in hot countries, where two combu&s;tible &s;ub&s;tances ea&s;ily kindle by attrition, it is probable that the attrition of &s;uch &s;ub|&s;tances fir&s;t produced fire, and here it was therefore natural for art to adopt the &s;ame operation, with a view to produce the &s;ame effect. It may indeed be true that fire is now pro|duced in many cold countries by attrition, and in many hot by a &s;troke; but perhaps upon enquiry there may appear rea&s;on to conclude that this has ari&s;en from the communi|cation of one country with another, and that with re&s;pect to the original production of fire in hot and cold countries, the di&s;tinction is well founded.</P>
<P>There may perhaps be &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that men became gradually acquainted with the nature and effects of fire, by its permanent exi&s;tence in a volcano, there being re|mains of volcanoes, or ve&s;tiges of their effects, in almo&s;t every part of the world: by a volcano, however, no method of producing fire, otherwi&s;e than by contact, could be learnt&punc;
<PB N="641" REF="246">
the production and application of fire therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> &s;till &s;eem to afford abundant &s;ubject of &s;peculation to the curious.</P>
<P>The weapons of the&s;e people are &s;pears or lances, and the&s;e are of different kinds: &s;ome that we &s;aw upon the &s;outhern part of the coa&s;t had four prongs, pointed with bone, and barbed; the points were al&s;o &s;meared with a hard re&s;in, which gave them a poli&s;h, and made them enter deeper into what they &s;truck. To the northward, the lance has but one point: the &s;haft is made of cane, or the &s;talk of a plant &s;omewhat re&s;embling a bulru&s;h, very &s;trait and light, and from eight to fourteen feet long, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal joints, where the pieces are let into each other, and bound together; to this are fitted points of different kinds; &s;ome are of hard heavy wood, and &s;ome are the bones of fi&s;h: we &s;aw &s;everal that were pointed with the &s;tings of the &s;ting-ray, the large&s;t that they could procure, and barbed with &s;everal that were &s;maller, fa&s;tened on in a contrary di|rection; the points of wood were al&s;o &s;ometimes armed with &s;harp pieces of broken &s;hells, which were &s;tuck in, and at the junctures covered with re&s;in: the lances that are thus barbed, are indeed dreadful weapons, for when once they have taken place, they can never be drawn back without tearing away the fle&s;h, or leaving the &s;harp ragged &s;plinters of the bone or &s;hell which forms the beard, behind them in the wound. The&s;e weapons are thrown with great force and dexterity; if intended to wound at a &s;hort di&s;tance, be|tween ten and twenty yards, &s;imply with the hand, but if at the di&s;tance of forty or fifty, with an in&s;trument which we called a throwing &s;tick. This is a plain &s;mooth piece of a hard reddi&s;h wood, very highly poli&s;hed, about two inches broad, half an inch thick, and three feet long, with a &s;mall knob, or hook at one end, and a cro&s;s piece about three or four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nches long at the other: the knob at one end is received in
<PB N="642" REF="247">
a &s;mall dent or hollow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> which is made for that purpo&s;e in the &s;haft of the lance near the point, but from which it ea&s;ily &s;lips, upon being impelled, forward: when the lance is laid along upon this machine, and &s;ecured in a proper po|&s;ition by the knob, the per&s;on that is to throw it holds it over his &s;houlder, and after &s;haking it, delivers both the throwing &s;tick and lance with all his force, but the &s;tick being &s;topped by the cro&s;s piece which comes again&s;t the &s;houlder, with a &s;udden jerk, the lance flies forward with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, and with &s;o good an aim, that at the di&s;tance of fifty yards the&s;e Indians were more &s;ure of their mark than we could be with a &s;ingle bullet. Be&s;ides the&s;e lances, we &s;aw no offen&s;ive weapon upon this coa&s;t, except when we took our la&s;t view of it with our gla&s;&s;es, and then we thought we &s;aw a man with a bow and arrows, in which it is po&s;&s;ible we might be mi&s;taken. We &s;aw, however, at Botany Bay, a &s;hield or target, of an oblong &s;hape, about three feet long, and eighteen inches broad, which was made of the bark of a tree: this was fetched out of a hut by one of the men that oppo&s;ed our landing, who, when he ran away, left it behind him, and upon taking it up, we found that it had been pierced through with a &s;ingle pointed lance near the center. The&s;e &s;hields are certainly in frequent u&s;e among the people here, for though this was the only one that we &s;aw in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, we frequently found trees from which they appeared manife&s;tly to have been cut, the marks being ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e that were made by cutting buckets: &s;ometimes al&s;o we found the &s;hields cut out, but not yet taken off from the tree, the edges of the bark only being a little rai&s;ed by wedges, &s;o that the&s;e people appear to have di&s;covered that the bark of a tree becomes thicker and &s;tronger by being &s;uffered to remain upon the trunk after it has been cut round.</P>
<P><PB N="643" REF="248">The canoes of New Holland are as mean and rude as the hou&s;es.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> Tho&s;e on the &s;outhern part of the coa&s;t are nothing more than a piece of bark, about twelve feet long, tied to|gether at the ends, and kept open in the middle by &s;mall bows of wood: yet in a ve&s;&s;el of this con&s;truction we once &s;aw three people. In &s;hallow water they are &s;et forward by a pole, and in deeper by paddles, about eighteen inches long, one of which the boatman holds in each hand; mean as they are, they have many conveniences, they draw but little water, and they are very light, &s;o that they go upon mud banks to pick up &s;hell fi&s;h, the mo&s;t important u&s;e to which they can be applied, better perhaps than ve&s;&s;els of any other con&s;truction. We ob&s;erved, that in the middle of the&s;e canoes there was a heap of &s;ea-weed, and upon that a &s;mall fire; probably that the fi&s;h may be broiled and eaten the moment it is caught.</P>
<P>The canoes that we &s;aw when we advanced farther to the northward, are not made of bark, but of the trunk of a tree hollowed, perhaps by fire. They are about fourteen feet long, and, being very narrow, are fitted with an outrigger to prevent their over&s;etting. The&s;e are worked with pad|dles, that are &s;o large as to require both hands to manage one of them: the out&s;ide is wholly unmarked by any tool, but at each end the wood is left longer at the top than at the bottom, &s;o that there is a projection beyond the hollow part re&s;embling the end of a plank; the &s;ides are tolerably thin, but how the tree is felled and fa&s;hioned, we had no opportu|nity to learn. The only tools that we &s;aw among them are an adze, wretchedly made of &s;tone, &s;ome &s;mall pieces of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance in form of a wedge, a wooden mallet, and &s;ome &s;hells and fragments of coral. For poli&s;hing their throwing &s;ticks, and the points of their lances, they u&s;e the leaves of a kind of wild fig-tree, which bites upon wood al|mo&s;t

<P>The utmo&s;t freight of the&s;e canoes is four people, and if more at any time wanted to come over the river, one of tho&s;e who came fir&s;t was obliged to go back for the re&s;t: from this circum&s;tance, we conjectured that the boat we &s;aw, when we were lying in Endeavour River, was the only one in the neighbourhood: we have however &s;ome rea&s;on to believe that the bark canoes are al&s;o u&s;ed where the wooden ones are con&s;tructed, for upon one of the &s;mall i&s;lands where the natives had been fi&s;hing for turtle, we found one of the little paddles which had belonged to &s;uch a boat, and would have been u&s;ele&s;s on board any other.</P>
<P>By what means the inhabitants of this country are reduced to &s;uch a number as it can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, is not perhaps very ea&s;y to gue&s;s; whether, like the inhabitants of New Zealand, they are de&s;troyed by the hands of each other in conte&s;ts for food; whether they are &s;wept off by accidental famine, or whether there is any cau&s;e which prevents the increa&s;e of the &s;pecies, mu&s;t be left for future adventurers to determine. That they have wars, appears by their weapons; for &s;up|po&s;ing the lances to &s;erve merely for the &s;triking of fi&s;h, the &s;hield could be intended for nothing but a defence again&s;t men; the only mark of ho&s;tility, however, which we &s;aw among them, was the perforation of the &s;hield by a &s;pear which has been ju&s;t mentioned, for none of them appeared to have been wounded by an enemy. Neither can we determine
<PB N="645" REF="250">

Augu&s;t.</NOTE> the re&s;olution with which two of them attempted to prevent our landing, when we had two boats full of men, in Botany Bay, even after one of them was wounded with &s;mall &s;hot, gave us rea&s;on to conclude that they were not only naturally courageous, but that they had acquired a familiarity with the dangers of ho&s;tility, and were, by habit as well as nature, a daring and warlike people; but their precipitate flight from every other place that we approached, without even a menace, while they were out of our reach, was an indication of uncommon tamene&s;s and timidity, &s;uch as tho&s;e who had only been occa&s;ionally warriors mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;haken off, whatever might have been their natural di&s;po&s;ition. I have faithfully related facts, the reader mu&s;t judge of the people for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>From the account that has been given of our commerce with them, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that we &s;hould know much of their language; yet as this is an object of great curio&s;ity, e&s;pecially to the learned, and of great importance in their re&s;earches into the origin of the various nations that have been di&s;covered, we took &s;ome pains to bring away &s;uch a &s;pecimen of it as might, in a certain degree, an&s;wer the pur|po&s;e, and I &s;hall now give an account how it was procured. If we wanted to know the name of a &s;tone, we took a &s;tone up into our hands, and as well as we could, intimated by &s;igns that we wi&s;hed they &s;hould name it: the word that they pronounced upon the occa&s;ion, we immediately wrote down. This method, though it was the be&s;t we could con|trive, might certainly lead us into many mi&s;takes; for if an Indian was to take up a &s;tone, and a&s;k us the name of it, we might an&s;wer a pebble or a flint; &s;o when we took up a &s;tone, and a&s;ked an Indian the name of it, he might pro|nounce a word that di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;pecies and not the

<P>I &s;hall now quit this country, with a few ob&s;ervations re|lative to the currents and tides upon the coa&s;t. From lati|tude 32&deg;, and &s;omewhat higher, down to Sandy Cape, in latitude 24&deg; 46&prime;, we con&s;tantly &s;ound a current &s;etting to the &s;outhward, at the rate of about ten or fifteen miles a day, being more or le&s;s, according to our di&s;tance from the land, for it always ran with more force in &s;hore than in the offing; but I could never &s;atisfy my&s;elf whether the flood-tide came from the &s;outhward, the ea&s;tward, or the northward: I in|clined to the opinion that it came from the &s;outh-ea&s;t, but the fir&s;t time we anchored off the coa&s;t, which was in latitude 24&deg; 30&prime;, about ten leagues to the &s;outh ea&s;t of Bu&s;tard Bay, I found it come from the north we&s;t; on the contrary, thirty leagues farther to the north we&s;t, on the &s;outh &s;ide of Keppel Bay, I found that it came from the ea&s;t, and at the northern part of that Bay it came from the northward, but with a much &s;lower motion than it had come from the ea&s;t: on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Bay of Inlets, it &s;et &s;trongly to the we&s;tward, as far as the opening of Broad Sound; but on the north &s;ide of that Sound, it came with a very &s;low motion from the north we&s;t; and when we lay at anchor before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Bay,
<PB N="648" REF="253">
it came from the northward:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> to account for its cour&s;e in all this variety of directions, we need only admit that the flood-tide comes from the ea&s;t or &s;outh ea&s;t. It is well known, that where there are deep inlets, and large creeks into low lands, running up from the &s;ea, and not occa&s;ioned by rivers of fre&s;h water, there will always be a great indraught of the flood-tide, the direction of which will be determined by the po&s;ition or direction of the coa&s;t which forms the entrance of &s;uch inlet, whatever be its cour&s;e at &s;ea; and where the tides are weak, which upon this coa&s;t is generally the ca&s;e, a large inlet will, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, attract the flood-tide for many leagues.</P>
<P>A view of the chart will at once illu&s;trate this po&s;ition. To the northward of Whit&s;unday's Pa&s;&s;age there is no large in|let, con&s;equently the flood &s;ets to the northward, or north we&s;tward, according to the direction of the coa&s;t, and the ebb to the &s;outh, or &s;outh ea&s;tward, at lea&s;t &s;uch is their cour&s;e at a little di&s;tance from the land, for very near it they will be influenced by &s;mall inlets. I al&s;o ob&s;erved, that we had only one high tide in twenty-four hours, which hap|pened in the night. The difference between the perpen|dicular ri&s;e of the water in the day and the night, when there is a &s;pring-tide, is no le&s;s than three feet, which, where the tides are &s;o incon&s;iderable as they are here, is a great proportion of the whole difference between high and low water. This irregularity of the tides, which is worthy of notice, we did not di&s;cover till we were run a&s;hore, and perhaps farther to the northward it is &s;till greater: after we got within the reef the &s;econd time, we found the tides more con&s;iderable than we had ever done before, except in the Bay of Inlets, and po&s;&s;ibly this may be owing to the water being more confined between the &s;hoals; here al&s;o the flood &s;ets to

<P>IN the afternoon of Thur&s;day Augu&s;t the 23d,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 23.</NOTE> after leaving Booby I&s;land, we &s;teered W. N. W. with light airs from the S. S. W. till five o'clock, when it fell calm, and the tide of ebb &s;oon after &s;etting to the N. E. we came to an anchor in eight fathom water, with a &s;oft &s;andy bottom. Booby I&s;land bore S. 50 E. di&s;tant five miles, and the Prince of Wales's I&s;les extended from N. E. by N. to S. 55 E.; between the&s;e there appeared to be a clear open pa&s;&s;age, extending from N. 46 E. to E. by N.</P>
<P>At half an hour after five, in the morning of the 24th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 24.</NOTE> as we were purcha&s;ing the anchor, the cable parted at about eight or ten fathom from the ring: the &s;hip then began to drive, but I immediately dropped another anchor, which brought her up before &s;he got more than a cable's length from the buoy; the boats were then &s;ent to &s;weep for the anchor, but could not &s;ucceed. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 10&deg; 30&prime; S. As I was re&s;olved not to leave the anchor behind, while there remained a po&s;&s;ibility of recovering it, I &s;ent the boats again after dinner, with a &s;mall line, to di&s;cover where it lay; this being happily ef|fected, we &s;wept for it with a haw&s;er, and by the &s;ame haw&s;er hove the &s;hip up to it: we proceeded to weigh it, but

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 25.</NOTE>As &s;oon as it was light, we &s;weeped it again, and heaved it to the bows: by eight o'clock, we weighed the other an|chor, got under &s;ail, and, with a fine breeze at E. N. E. &s;tood to the north we&s;t. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 10&deg; 18&prime; S. longitude 219&deg; 39&prime; W. At this time, we had no land in &s;ight, but about two miles to the &s;outhward of us lay a large &s;hoal, upon which the &s;ea broke with great vio|lence, and part of which, I believe, is dry at low water. It extends N. W. and S. E. and is about five leagues in circuit. Our depth of water, from the time we weighed till now, was nine fathom, but it &s;oon &s;hallowed to &s;even fathom; and at half an hour after one, having run eleven miles between noon and that time, the boat which was a-head made the &s;ignal for &s;hoal water; we immediately let go an anchor, and brought the &s;hip up with all the &s;ails &s;tanding, for the boat having ju&s;t been relieved, was at but a little di&s;tance: upon looking out from the &s;hip, we &s;aw &s;hoal water almo&s;t all round us, both wind and tide at the &s;ame time &s;etting upon it. The &s;hip was in &s;ix fathom, but upon &s;ounding round her, at the di&s;tance of half a cable's length, we found &s;carcely two. This &s;hoal reached from the ea&s;t, round by the north and we&s;t, as far as the &s;outh we&s;t, &s;o that there was no way for us to get clear but that which we came. This was another hair's-breadth e&s;cape, for it was near high water, and there run a &s;hort cockling &s;ea, which mu&s;t very &s;oon have bulged the &s;hip if &s;he had &s;truck; and if her direc|tion had been half a cable's length more either to the right or left, &s;he mu&s;t have &s;truck before the &s;ignal for the &s;hoal was made. The &s;hoals which, like the&s;e, lie a fathom or two under water, are the mo&s;t dangerous of any, for they do

Between three and four o'clock the tide of ebb be|gan to make, and I &s;ent the Ma&s;ter to &s;ound to the &s;outh|ward and &s;outh we&s;tward, and in the mean time, as the &s;hip tended, I weighed anchor, and with a little &s;ail &s;tood fir&s;t to the &s;outhward, and afterwards edging away to the we&s;t|ward, got once more out of danger. At &s;un&s;et, we anchored in ten fathom, with a &s;andy bottom, having a fre&s;h gale at E. S. E.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the morning, we weighed again and &s;tood we&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 26.</NOTE> having, as u&s;ual, fir&s;t &s;ent a boat ahead to &s;ound. I had in|tended to &s;teer N. W. till I had made the &s;outh coa&s;t of New Guinea, de&s;igning, if po&s;&s;ible, to touch upon it; but upon meeting with the&s;e &s;hoals, I altered my cour&s;e, in hopes of finding a clearer channel, and deeper water. In this I &s;uc|ceeded, for by noon our depth of water was gradually in|crea&s;ed to &s;eventeen fathom. Our latitude was now by ob|&s;ervation 10&deg; 10&prime; S.; and our longitude 220&deg; 12&prime; W. No land was in &s;ight. We continued to &s;teer we&s;t till &s;un&s;et, our depth of water being from twenty-&s;even to twenty-three fa|thom: we then &s;hortened &s;ail, and kept upon a wind all night; four hours on one tack, and four on another. At day-light, we made all the &s;ail we could,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 27.</NOTE> and &s;teered W. N. W. till eight o'clock, and then N. W. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 9&deg; 56&prime; S.; longitude 221&deg; W.; variation 2&deg; 30&prime; E. We continued our N. W. cour&s;e till &s;un&s;et, when we again &s;hortened &s;ail, and hauled clo&s;e upon a wind to the northward: our depth of water was twenty-one fathom. At eight, we tacked and &s;tood to the &s;outhward till twelve; then &s;tood to the northward with little &s;ail till day-light:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 28.</NOTE> our &s;oundings were from twenty-five to &s;eventeen fathom, the water growing gradually &s;hallow as we &s;tood to the north|ward.
<PB N="652" REF="257">
At this time we made &s;ail and &s;tood to the north,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t.

Our latitude by ob&s;ervation was now 8&deg; 52&prime; S. which is in the &s;ame parallel as that in which the &s;outhern parts of New Guinea are laid down in the charts; but there are only two points &s;o far to the &s;outh, and I reckoned that we were a degree to the we&s;tward of them both, and there|fore did not &s;ee the land, which trends more to the north|ward. We found the &s;ea here to be in many parts covered with a brown &s;cum, &s;uch as &s;ailors generally call &s;pawn. When I fir&s;t &s;aw it, I was alarmed, fearing that we were among &s;hoals; but upon &s;ounding, we found the &s;ame depth of water as in other places. This &s;cum was examined both by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, but they could not de|termine what it was: it was formed of innumerable &s;mall particles, not more than half a line in length, each of which in the micro&s;cope appeared to con&s;i&s;t of thirty or forty tubes; and each tube was divided through its whole length by &s;mall partitions into many cells, like the tubes of the con|ferva: they were &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to the vegetable king|dom, becau&s;e upon burning them they produced no &s;mell like that of an animal &s;ub&s;tance. The &s;ame appearance had been ob&s;erved upon the coa&s;t of Brazil and New Holland, but never at any con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hore. In the evening a &s;mall bird hovered about the &s;hip, and at night, &s;ettling among the rigging, was taken. It proved to be exactly the &s;ame bird which Dampier has de&s;cribed, and of which he has given a rude figure, by the name of a Noddy from New Holland. [See his Voyages, vol. iii. p. 98.

Our &s;oundings during the night were very irregular from &s;even to five fathom, &s;uddenly changing from deep to &s;hallow, and from &s;hallow to deep, without in the lea&s;t corre&s;ponding with our di&s;tance from the land. At half an hour after &s;ix in the morning a &s;mall low i&s;land, which lay at the di&s;tance of about a league from the main, bore N. by W. di&s;tant five miles: this i&s;land lies in latitude 8&deg; 13&prime; S., longitude 221&deg; 25&prime; W.; and I find it laid down in the charts by the names of Bartholomew and Whermoy&s;en. We now &s;teered N.W. by W. W.N.W. W. by N. W. by S. and S.W. by W. as we found the land lie, with from five to nine fathom; and though we reckoned we were not more than four leagues from it, yet it was &s;o low and level that we could but ju&s;t &s;ee it from the deck. It appeared however to be well covered with wood, and among other trees, we thought we could di&s;tingui&s;h the cocoa-nut. We &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places, and therefore knew there were inhabitants. At noon we were about three leagues from the land; the we&s;termo&s;t part of which that was in &s;ight bore S. 79&deg; W. Our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 8&deg; 19&prime; S. and longitude 221&deg; 44&prime; W. The i&s;land of St. Bartholomew bore N. 74 E. di&s;tant 20 miles.</P>
<P><PB N="654" REF="259"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. Augu&s;t. Wedne&s;. 29.</NOTE>After &s;teering S.W. by W. &s;ix miles, we had &s;hoal water on our &s;tarboard bow, which I &s;ent the yawl to &s;ound, and at the &s;ame time hauled off upon a wind till four o'clock, and though during that time we had run &s;ix miles, we had not deepened our water an inch. I then edged away S.W. four miles more; but finding it &s;till &s;hoal water, I brought to and called the boats aboard. At this time, being between three and four leagues from the &s;hore, and the yawl having found only three fathom water in the place to which I had &s;ent her to &s;ound, I hauled off clo&s;e upon a wind, and wea|thered the &s;hoal about half a mile.</P>
<P>Between one and two o'clock, we pa&s;&s;ed a bay or inlet be|fore which lies a &s;mall i&s;land that &s;eems to &s;helter it from the &s;outherly winds; but I very much doubt whether there is &s;ufficient depth of water behind it for &s;hipping.

<P>We &s;tretched off to &s;ea till twelve o'clock, when we were about eleven leagues from the land, and had deepened our water to twenty-nine fathom. We now tacked and &s;tood in till five in the morning;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 30.</NOTE> when, being in &s;ix fathom and an half, we tacked and laid the head of the ve&s;&s;el off till day-light, when we &s;aw the land, bearing N.W. by W. at about the di&s;tance of four leagues. We now made &s;ail, and &s;teered fir&s;t W.S.W. then W. by S.; but coming into five fathom and an half, we hauled off S. W. till we deepened our water to eight fathom, and then kept away W. by S. and W. having nine fathom, and the land ju&s;t in &s;ight from the deck; we judged it to be about four leagues di&s;tant, and it was &s;till very low and woody. Great quantities of the brown &s;cum continued to appear upon the water, and the &s;ailors, having

<P>As all this coa&s;t appears to have been very minutely ex|amined by the Dutch, and as our track with the &s;oundings will appear by the chart, it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that we con|tinued our cour&s;e to the northward with very &s;hallow water, upon a bank of mud, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the &s;hore as that it could &s;carcely be &s;een from the &s;hip, till the 3d of Sep|tember. During this time we made many attempts to get near enough to go on &s;hore, but without &s;ucce&s;s; and hav|ing now lo&s;t &s;ix days of fair wind, at a time when we knew the &s;outh ea&s;t mon&s;oon to be nearly at an end, we began to be impatient of farther delay, and determined to run the &s;hip in as near to the &s;hore as po&s;&s;ible, and then land with the pinnace, while &s;he kept plying off and on, to examine the produce of the country, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the inha|bitants. For the two la&s;t days we had early in the morning a light breeze from the &s;hore, which was &s;trongly impreg|nated with the fragrance of the trees, &s;hrubs, and herbage that covered it, the &s;mell being &s;omething like that of Gum Benjamin. On the 3d of September, at day-break,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September, Monday 3.</NOTE> we &s;aw the land extending from N. by E. to S.E. at about four leagues di&s;tance, and we then kept &s;tanding in for it with a fre&s;h gale at E.S.E. and E. by S. till nine o'clock, when being within about three or four miles of it, and in three fathom water, we brought to. The pinnace being hoi&s;ted out, I &s;et off from the &s;hip with the boat's crew, accom|panied by Mr. Banks, who al&s;o took his &s;ervants, and Dr. Solander, being in all twelve per&s;ons well armed; we rowed
<PB N="656" REF="261">
directly towards the &s;hore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Monday 3.</NOTE> but the water was &s;o &s;hallow that we could not reach it by about two hundred yards: we waded however the re&s;t of the way, having left two of the &s;eamen to take care of the boat. Hitherto we had &s;een no &s;igns of inhabitants at this place; but as &s;oon as we got a&s;hore we di&s;covered the prints of human feet, which could not long have been impre&s;&s;ed upon the &s;and, as they were below high-water mark: we therefore concluded that the people were at no great di&s;tance, and, as a thick wood came down within a hundred yards of the water, we thought it nece&s;&s;ary to proceed with caution, le&s;t we &s;hould fall into an ambu&s;cade and our retreat to the boat be cut off. We walked along the &s;kirts of the wood, and at the di&s;tance of about two hundred yards from the place where we landed, we came to a grove of cocoa-nut trees, which &s;tood upon the banks of a little brook of bracki&s;h water. The trees were of a &s;mall growth, but well hung with fruit; and near them was a &s;hed or hut, which had been covered with their leaves, though mo&s;t of them were now fallen off: about the hut lay a great number of the &s;hells of the fruit, &s;ome of which ap|peared to be ju&s;t fre&s;h from the tree. We looked at the fruit very wi&s;hfully, but not thinking it &s;afe to climb, we were obliged to leave it without ta&s;ting a &s;ingle nut. At a little di&s;tance from this place we found plantains, and a bread|fruit tree, but it had nothing upon it; and having now ad|vanced about a quarter of a mile from the boat, three In|dians ru&s;hed out of the wood with a hideous &s;hout, at about the di&s;tance of a hundred yards; and as they ran towards us, the foremo&s;t threw &s;omething out of his hand, which &s;lew on one &s;ide of him, and burnt exactly like gunpowder, but made no report: the other two in&s;tantly threw their lances at us; and, as no time was now to be lo&s;t, we di&s;charged our
<PB N="657" REF="262">
pieces, which were loaded with &s;mall &s;hot.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Monday 3.</NOTE> It is probable that they did not feel the &s;hot, for though they halted a mo|ment, they did not retreat; and a third dart was thrown at us. As we thought their farther approach might be pre|vented with le&s;s ri&s;k of life, than it would co&s;t to defend our&s;elves again&s;t their attack if they &s;hould come nearer, we loaded our pieces with ball, and fired a &s;econd time: by this di&s;charge it is probable that &s;ome of them were wounded; yet we had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee that they all ran away with great agility. As I was not di&s;po&s;ed forcibly to invade this country, either to gratify our appetites or our curio&s;ity, and perceived that nothing was to be done upon friendly terms, we improved this interval, in which the de&s;truction of the natives was no longer nece&s;&s;ary to our own defence, and with all expedition returned towards our boat. As we were advancing along the &s;hore, we perceived that the two men on board made &s;ignals that more Indians were coming down; and before we got into the water we &s;aw &s;everal of them coming round a point at the di&s;tance of about five hundred yards: it is probable that they had met with the three who fir&s;t attacked us; for as &s;oon as they &s;aw us they halted, and &s;eemed to wait till their main body &s;hould come up. We entered the water, and waded towards the boat; and they remained at their &s;tation, without giving us any interrup|tion. As &s;oon as we were aboard we rowed abrea&s;t of them, and their number then appeared to be between &s;ixty and a hundred. We now took a view of them at our lei&s;ure; they made much the &s;ame appearance as the New Hollanders, being nearly of the &s;ame &s;tature, and having their hair &s;hort cropped: like them al&s;o they were all &s;tark naked, but we thought the colour of their &s;kin was not quite &s;o dark; this however might perhaps be merely the effect of their not being quite &s;o dirty. All this while they were &s;houting de|fiance,
<PB N="658" REF="263">
and letting off their fires by four or five at a time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Monday 3.</NOTE> What the&s;e fires were, or for what purpo&s;e intended, we could not imagine: tho&s;e who di&s;charged them had in their hands a &s;hort piece of &s;tick, po&s;&s;ibly a hollow cane, which they &s;wung &s;ideways from them, and we immediately &s;aw fire and &s;moke, exactly re&s;embling tho&s;e of a mu&s;quet, and of no longer duration. This wonderful phaenomenon was ob&s;erved from the &s;hip, and the deception was &s;o great that the people on board thought they had fire-arms; and in the boat, if we had not been &s;o near as that we mu&s;t have heard the report, we &s;hould have thought they had been firing volleys. After we had looked at them attentively &s;ome time, without taking any notice of their fla&s;hing and vociferation, we fired &s;ome mu&s;quets over their heads: upon hearing the balls rattle among the trees, they walked lei&s;urely away, and we returned to the &s;hip. Upon examining the weapons they had thrown at us, we found them to be light darts, about four feet long, very ill made, of a reed or bamboo cane, and pointed with hard wood, in which there were many barbs. They were di&s;charged with great force; for though we were at &s;ixty yards di&s;tance, they went beyond us, but in what manner we could not exactly &s;ee: po&s;&s;ibly they might be &s;hot with a bow; but we &s;aw no bows among them when we &s;urveyed them from the boat, and we were in ge|neral of opinion that they were thrown with a &s;tick, in the manner practi&s;ed by the New Hollanders.</P>
<P>This place lies in the latitude of 6&deg; 15&prime; S. and about &s;ixty-five leagues to the N. E. of Port Saint Augu&s;tine, or Walche Caep, and is near what is called in the charts C. de la Colta de St. Bonaventura. The land here, like that in every other part of the coa&s;t is very low, but covered with a luxuriance of wood and herbage that can &s;carcely be conceived. We &s;aw
<PB N="659" REF="264">
the cocoa-nut, the bread-fruit, and the plantain tree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Monday 3.</NOTE> all flouri&s;hing in a &s;tate of the highe&s;t perfection, though the cocoa-nuts were green, and the bread-fruit not in &s;ea&s;on; be&s;ides mo&s;t of the trees, &s;hrubs, and plants that are com|mon to the South Sea i&s;lands, New Zealand, and New Hol|land.</P>
<P>Soon after our return to the &s;hip, we hoi&s;ted in the boat and made &s;ail to the we&s;tward, being re&s;olved to &s;pend no more time upon this coa&s;t, to the great &s;atisfaction of a very con&s;iderable majority of the &s;hip's company. But I am &s;orry to &s;ay that I was &s;trongly urged by &s;ome of the officers to &s;end a party of men a&s;hore, and cut down the cocoa-nut trees for the &s;ake of the fruit. This I peremptorily refu&s;ed, as equally unju&s;t and cruel. The natives had attacked us merely for landing upon their coa&s;t, when we attempted to take nothing away, and it was therefore morally certain that they would have made a vigorous effort to defend their property if it had been invaded, in which ca&s;e many of them mu&s;t have fallen a &s;acrifice to our attempt, and perhaps al&s;o &s;ome of our own people. I &s;hould have regretted the nece&s;|&s;ity of &s;uch a mea&s;ure, if I had been in want of the nece&s;&s;a|ries of life; and certainly it would have been highly crimi|nal when nothing was to be obtained but two or three hundred of green cocoa-nuts, which would at mo&s;t have procured us a mere tran&s;ient gratification. I might indeed have proceeded farther along the coa&s;t to the northward and we&s;tward, in &s;earch of a place where the &s;hip might have lain &s;o near the &s;hore as to cover the people with her guns when they landed; but this would have obviated only part of the mi&s;chief, and though it might have &s;ecured us, it would probably in the very act have been fatal to the na|tives. Be&s;ides, we had rea&s;on to think that before &s;uch a
<PB N="660" REF="265">
place would have been found,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Monday 3.</NOTE> we &s;hould have been carried &s;o far to the we&s;tward as to have been obliged to go to Bata|via, on the north &s;ide of Java; which I did not think &s;o &s;afe a pa&s;&s;age as to the &s;outh of Java, through the Streights of Sunday: the &s;hip al&s;o was &s;o leaky that I doubted whether it would not be nece&s;&s;ary to heave her down at Batavia, which was another rea&s;on for making the be&s;t of our way to that place; e&s;pecially as no di&s;covery could be expected in &s;eas which had already been navigated, and where every coa&s;t had been laid down by the Dutch geographers. The Spaniards indeed, as well as the Dutch, &s;eem to have circum|navigated all the i&s;lands in New Guinea, as almo&s;t every place that is di&s;tingui&s;hed in the chart has a name in both languages. The charts with which I compared &s;uch part of this coa&s;t as I vi&s;ited, are bound up with a French work, in|titled, "Hi&s;toire des Navigationes aux Terres Au&s;trales," which was publi&s;hed in 1756, and I found them tolerably exact; yet I know not by whom, nor when they were taken: and though New Holland and New Guinea are in them repre|&s;ented as two di&s;tinct countries, the very hi&s;tory in which they are bound up, leaves it in doubt. I pretend however to no more merit in this part of the voyage, than to have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed the fact beyond all controver&s;y.</P>
<P>As the two countries lie very near each other, and the in|termediate &s;pace is full of i&s;lands, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that they were both peopled from one common &s;tock: yet no intercour&s;e appears to have been kept up between them; for if there had, the cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, plantains, and other fruits of New Guinea, which are equally nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of life, would certainly have been tran&s;planted to New Holland, where no traces of them are to be found. The Author of the "Hi&s;toire des Navigationes aux Terres Au&s;trales,"
<PB N="661" REF="266">
in his account of La Maire's voyage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Monday 3.</NOTE> has given a vocabulary of the language that is &s;poken in an i&s;land near New Britain, and we find, by comparing that vocabulary with the words which we learnt in New Holland, that the languages are not the &s;ame. If therefore it &s;hould appear, that the lan|guages of New Britain and New Guinea are the &s;ame, there will be rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that New Britain and New Guinea were peopled from a common &s;tock; but that the inhabi|tants of New Holland had a different origin, notwith&s;tanding the proximity of the countries.</P>

W. &frac12; W. to N. E.: at this time we &s;ounded, and had no ground with 140 fathom. At midnight, having but little wind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 12.</NOTE> we tacked and &s;tood in, and at noon the next day, our latitude, by ob|&s;ervation, was 9&deg; 36&prime; S. This day, we &s;aw &s;moke on &s;hore in &s;everal places, and had &s;een many fires during the night. The land appeared to be very high, ri&s;ing in gradual &s;lopes one above another: the hills were in general covered with thick woods, but among them we could di&s;tingui&s;h naked &s;pots of a con&s;iderable extent, which had the appearance of having been cleared by art. At five o'clock in the afternoon, we were within a mile and a half of the &s;hore, in &s;ixteen fa|thom water, and abrea&s;t of a &s;mall inlet into the low land, which lies in latitude 9&deg; 34&prime;S. and probably is the &s;ame that

Dampier entered with his boat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Wedne&s;. 12.</NOTE> for it did not &s;eem to have &s;ufficient depth of water for a &s;hip. The land here an&s;wered well to the de&s;cription that he has given of it: clo&s;e to the beach it was covered with high &s;piry trees, which he men|tions as having the appearance of pines; behind the&s;e there &s;eemed to be &s;alt water creeks, and many mangroves, inter|&s;per&s;ed however with cocoa-nut trees: the flat land at the beach appeared in &s;ome places to extend inward two or three miles before the ri&s;e of the fir&s;t hill; in this part, however, we &s;aw no appearance of plantations or hou&s;es, but great fertility, and from the number of fires, we judged that the place mu&s;t be well peopled.</P>
<P>When we had approached within a mile and an half of the &s;hore, we tacked and &s;tood off, and the extreams of the coa&s;t then extended from N. E. by E. to W. by S. &frac12; S. The &s;outh we&s;terly extremity was a low point, di&s;tant from us about three leagues. While we were &s;tanding in for the &s;hore, we &s;ounded &s;everal times, but had no ground till we came within about two miles and a half, and then we had five and twenty fathom, with a &s;oft bottom. After we had tacked, we &s;tood off till midnight, with the wind at S.; we then tacked and &s;tood two hours to the we&s;tward, when the wind veered to S. W. and W. S. W. and we then &s;tood to the &s;outhward again.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 13.</NOTE> In the morning, we found the variation to be 1&deg; 10&prime; W. by the amplitude, and by the azimuth 1&deg; 27&prime;.

We continued &s;teering along the &s;hore, till the morning of the 15th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 15.</NOTE> the land &s;till appearing hilly, but not &s;o high as it had been: the hills in general came quite down to the &s;ea, and where they did not, we &s;aw in&s;tead of flats and mangrove land, immen&s;e groves of cocoa-nut trees, reaching about a mile up from the beach: there the plantations and hou&s;es commenced, and appeared to be innumerable. The hou&s;es were &s;haded by groves of the fan palm, or <HI>bora&s;&s;us,</HI> and the plantations, which were inclo&s;ed by a fence, reached almo&s;t to the tops of the highe&s;t hills. We &s;aw however neither people nor cattle, though our gla&s;&s;es were continually employed, at which we were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>We continued our cour&s;e, with little variation, till nine o'clock in the morning of the 16th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 16.</NOTE> when we &s;aw the &s;mall i&s;land called ROTTE; and at noon, the i&s;land SEMAU, lying off the &s;outh end of Timor, bore N. W.</P>
<P>Dampier, who has given a large de&s;cription of the i&s;land of Timor, &s;ays, that it is &s;eventy leagues long, and &s;ixteen broad, and that it lies nearly N. E. and S. W. I found the ea&s;t &s;ide of it to lie neare&s;t N. E. by E. and S. W. by W. and the &s;outh end to lie in latitude 10&deg; 23&prime; S. longitude 236&deg; 5&prime; W. We ran about forty-five leagues along the ea&s;t &s;ide, and found the navigation altogether free from danger. The land which is bounded by the &s;ea, except near the &s;outh end, is low for two or three miles within the beach, and in general inter&s;ected by &s;alt creeks: behind the low land are moun|tains, which ri&s;e one above another to a con&s;iderable height. We &s;teered W. N. W. till two in the afternoon, when, being within a &s;mall di&s;tance of the north end of Rotte, we hauled
<PB N="668" REF="273">
up N. N. W. in order to go between it and Semau:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Sunday 16.</NOTE> after &s;teer|ing three leagues upon this cour&s;e, we edged away N. W. and W. and by &s;ix, we were clear of all the i&s;lands. At this time, the &s;outh part of Semau, which lies in latitude 10&deg; 15&prime; S. bore N. E. di&s;tant four leagues, and the i&s;land of Rotte extended as far to the &s;outhward as S. 36 W. The north end of this i&s;land, and the &s;outh end of Timor, lie N. &frac12; E. and S. &frac12; W. and are about three or four leagues di&s;tant from each other. At the we&s;t end of the pa&s;&s;age between Rotte and Semau, are two &s;mall i&s;lands, one of which lies near the Rotte &s;hore, and the other off the &s;outh we&s;t point of Semau: there is a good channel between them, about &s;ix miles broad, through which we pa&s;&s;ed. The i&s;le of Rotte has not &s;o lofty and mountainous an appearance as Timor, though it is agreeably diver&s;ified by hill and valley: on the north &s;ide, there are many &s;andy beaches, near which grew &s;ome trees of the fan palm, but the far greater part was covered with a kind of bru&s;hy wood, that was without leaves. The appearance of Semau was nearly the &s;ame with that of Timor, but not quite &s;o high. About ten o'clock at night, we ob&s;erved a phaenomenon in the heavens, which in many particulars re&s;embled the aurora borealis, and in others, was very different: it con&s;i&s;ted of a dull reddi&s;h light, and reached about twenty degrees above the horizon: its extent was very different at different times, but it was never le&s;s than eight or ten points of the compa&s;s: through, and out of this, pa&s;&s;ed rays of light of a brighter colour, which va|ni&s;hed, and were renewed nearly in the &s;ame time as tho&s;e of the aurora borealis, but had no degree of the tremulous or vibratory motion which is ob&s;erved in that phaenomenon: the body of it bore S. S. E. from the &s;hip, and it continued, without any diminution of its brightne&s;s, till twelve o'clock,
<PB N="669" REF="274">
when we retired to &s;leep, but how long afterwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Being clear of all the i&s;lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 17.</NOTE> which are laid down in the maps we had on board, between Timor and Java, we &s;teered a we&s;t cour&s;e till &s;ix o'clock the next morning, when we un|expectedly &s;aw an i&s;land bearing W. S. W. and at fir&s;t I thought we had made a new di&s;covery. We &s;teered directly for it, and by ten o'clock were clo&s;e in with the north &s;ide of it, where we &s;aw hou&s;es, cocoa-nut trees, and, to our very agreeable &s;urpri&s;e, numerous flocks of &s;heep. This was a temptation not to be re&s;i&s;ted by people in our &s;ituation, e&s;pe|cially as many of us were in a bad &s;tate of health, and many &s;till repining at my not having touched at Timor: it was therefore &s;oon determined to attempt a commerce with people who appeared to be &s;o well able to &s;upply our many nece&s;&s;ities, and remove at once the &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;content that had got footing among us. The pinnace was hoi&s;ted out, and Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, &s;ent to &s;ee if there was any convenient place to land, taking with him &s;ome trifles, as pre&s;ents to the natives, if any of them &s;hould appear. While he was gone, we &s;aw from the &s;hip two men on hor&s;eback, who &s;eemed to be riding upon the hills for their amu&s;ement, and often &s;topped to look at the &s;hip. By this we knew that the place had been &s;ettled by Europeans, and hoped, that the many di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances which always attend the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of commerce with &s;a|vages, would be avoided. In the mean time, Mr. Gore landed in a &s;mall &s;andy cove near &s;ome hou&s;es, and was met by eight or ten of the natives, who, as well in their dre&s;s as their per&s;ons, very much re&s;embled the Malays: they were without arms, except the knives which it is their cu&s;tom to wear in their girdles, and one of them had a jack a&s;s with him: they courteou&s;ly invited him a&s;hore, and con|ver&s;ed
<PB N="670" REF="275">
with him by &s;igns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Monday 17.</NOTE> but very little of the meaning of either party could be under&s;tood by the other. In a &s;hort time he returned with this report, and, to our great mortifi|cation, added, that there was no anchorage for the &s;hip. I &s;ent him however a &s;econd time, with both money and goods, that he might, if po&s;&s;ible, purcha&s;e &s;ome refre&s;h|ments, at lea&s;t for the &s;ick; and Dr. Solander went in the boat with him. In the mean time I kept &s;tanding on and off with the &s;hip, which at this time was within about a mile of the &s;hore. Before the boat could land, we &s;aw two other hor&s;emen, one of whom was in a complete European dre&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting of a blue coat, a white wai&s;tcoat, and a laced hat: the&s;e people, when the boat came to the &s;hore, took little notice of her, but &s;auntered about, and &s;eemed to look with great curio&s;ity at the &s;hip. We &s;aw however other hor&s;e|men, and a great number of per&s;ons on foot, gather round our people, and, to our great &s;atisfaction, perceived &s;everal cocoa-nuts carried into the boat, from which we concluded that peace and commerce were e&s;tabli&s;hed between us.</P>
<P>After the boat had been a&s;hore about an hour and a half, &s;he made the &s;ignal for having intelligence that there was a bay to leeward, where we might anchor: we &s;tood away directly for it, and the boat following, &s;oon came on board. The Lieutenant told us, that he had &s;een &s;ome of the prin|cipal people, who were dre&s;&s;ed in fine linen, and had chains of gold round their necks: he &s;aid, that he had not been able to trade, becau&s;e the owner of the cocoa-nuts was ab|&s;ent, but that about two dozen had been &s;ent to the boat as a pre&s;ent, and that &s;ome linen had been accepted in return. The people, to give him the information that he wanted, drew a map upon the &s;and, in which they made a rude re|pre&s;entation of a harbour to leeward, and a town near it: they al&s;o gave him to under&s;tand, that &s;heep, hogs, fowls,
<PB N="671" REF="276">
and fruit might there be procured in great plenty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Monday 17.</NOTE> Some of them frequently pronounced the word Portugue&s;e, and &s;aid &s;omething of Larntuca, upon the i&s;land of Ende: from this circum&s;tance, we conjectured that there were Portugue&s;e &s;omewhere upon the i&s;land, and a Portugue&s;e, who was in our boat, attempted to conver&s;e with the Indians in that lan|guage, but &s;oon found that they knew only a word or two of it by rote: one of them however, when they were giving our people to under&s;tand that there was a town near the harbour to which they had directed us, intimated, that as a token of going right, we &s;hould &s;ee &s;omewhat, which he expre&s;&s;ed by cro&s;&s;ing his fingers, and the Portugue&s;e in&s;tantly conceived that he meant to expre&s;s a cro&s;s. Ju&s;t as our people were putting off, the hor&s;eman in the European dre&s;s came up, but the officer not having his commi&s;&s;ion about him, thought it be&s;t to decline a conference.</P>
<P>At &s;even o'clock in the evening, we came to an anchor in the bay to which we had been directed, at about the di&s;tance of a mile from the &s;hore, in thirty-eight fathom water, with a clear &s;andy bottom. The north point of the bay bore N. 30 E. di&s;tant two miles and an half, and the &s;outh point, or we&s;t end of the i&s;land, bore S. 63 W. Ju&s;t as we got round the north point, and entered the bay, we di&s;covered a large Indian town or village, upon which we &s;tood on, hoi&s;ting a jack on the fore top-ma&s;t head: &s;oon after, to our great &s;ur|prize, Dutch colours were hoi&s;ted in the town, and three guns fired; we &s;tood on, however, till we had &s;oundings, and then anchored.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was light in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 18.</NOTE> we &s;aw the &s;ame colours hoi&s;ted upon the beach, abrea&s;t of the &s;hip; &s;up|po&s;ing therefore that the Dutch had a &s;ettlement here, I &s;ent Lieutenant Gore a&s;hore, to wait upon the Governor, or the
<PB N="672" REF="277">
chief per&s;on re&s;iding upon the &s;pot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Tue&s;day 18.</NOTE> and acquaint him who we were, and for what purpo&s;e we had touched upon the coa&s;t. As &s;oon as he came a&s;hore, he was received by a guard of between twenty and thirty Indians, armed with mu&s;kets, who conducted him to the town, where the colours had been hoi&s;ted the night before, carrying with them tho&s;e that had been hoi&s;ted upon the beach, and marching with|out any military regularity. As &s;oon as he arrived, he was introduced to the Raja, or King of the i&s;land, and by a Por|tugue&s;e interpreter, told him, that the &s;hip was a man of war belonging to the King of Great Britain, and that &s;he had many &s;ick on board, for whom he wanted to purcha&s;e &s;uch refre&s;hments as the i&s;land afforded. His Maje&s;ty replied, that he was willing to &s;upply us with whatever we wanted, but, that being in alliance with the Dutch Ea&s;t India Com|pany, he was not at liberty to trade with any other people, without having fir&s;t procured their con&s;ent, for which, how|ever, he &s;aid he would immediately apply to a Dutchman who belonged to the company, and who was the only white man upon the i&s;land. To this man, who re&s;ided at &s;ome di&s;tance, a letter was immediately di&s;patched, acquainting him with our arrival and reque&s;t: in the mean time, Mr. Gore di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to me, with an account of his &s;ituation, and the &s;tate of the treaty. In about three hours, the Dutch re&s;ident an&s;wered the letter that had been &s;ent him, in per&s;on: he proved to be a native of Saxony, and his name is Johan Chri&s;topher Lange, and the &s;ame per&s;on whom we had &s;een on hor&s;eback in a European dre&s;s: he behaved with great civility to Mr. Gore, and a&s;&s;ured him, that we were at liberty to purcha&s;e of the natives whatever we plea&s;ed. After a &s;hort time, he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of coming on board, &s;o did the king al&s;o, and &s;everal of his attendants: Mr. Gore intimated that he was ready to attend them, but
<PB N="673" REF="278">
they de&s;ired that two of our people might be left a&s;hore as ho&s;tages, and in this al&s;o they were indulged.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Tue&s;day 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>About two o'clock, they all came aboard the &s;hip, and our dinner being ready, they accepted our invitation to partake of it: I expected them immediately to &s;it down, but the King &s;eemed to he&s;itate, and at la&s;t, with &s;ome confu&s;ion, &s;aid he did not imagine that we, who were white men, would &s;uffer him, who was of a different colour, to &s;it down in our com|pany; a compliment &s;oon removed his &s;cruples, and we all &s;at down together with great cheerfulne&s;s and cordiality: happily we were at no lo&s;s for interpreters, both Dr. Solander and Mr. Sporing under&s;tanding Dutch enough to keep up a conver&s;ation with Mr. Lange, and &s;everal of the &s;eamen were able to conver&s;e with &s;uch of the natives as &s;poke Por|tugue&s;e. Our dinner happened to be mutton, and the King expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of having an Engli&s;h &s;heep; we had but one left, however that was pre&s;ented to him: the facility with which this was procured, encouraged him to a&s;k for an Engli&s;h dog, and Mr. Banks politely gave up his grey|hound: Mr. Lange then intimated that a &s;pying-gla&s;s would be acceptable, and one was immediately put into his hand. Our gue&s;ts then told us that the i&s;land abounded with buf|faloes, &s;heep, hogs, and fowls, plenty of which &s;hould be driven down to the beach the next day, that we might pur|cha&s;e as many of them as we &s;hould think fit: this put us all into high &s;pirits, and the liquor circulated rather fa&s;ter than either the Indians or the Saxon could bear; they inti|mated their de&s;ire to go away, however, before they were quite drunk, and were received upon deck, as they had been when they came aboard, by the marines under arms. The King expre&s;&s;ed a curio&s;ity to &s;ee them exerci&s;e, in which he was gratified, and they &s;ired three rounds: he looked at them with great attention, and was much &s;urpri&s;ed at their
<PB N="674" REF="279">
regularity and expedition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Tue&s;day 18.</NOTE> e&s;pecially in cocking their pieces; the fir&s;t time they did it, he &s;truck the &s;ide of the &s;hip with a &s;tick that he had in his hand, and cried out with great vehemence, that all the locks made but one click. They were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with many pre&s;ents, and when they went away &s;aluted with nine guns: Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went a&s;hore with them; and as &s;oon as they put off they gave us three cheers.</P>
<P>Our Gentlemen, when they came a&s;hore, walked up with them to the town, which con&s;i&s;ts of many hou&s;es, and &s;ome of them are large; they are however nothing more than a thatched roof, &s;upported over a boarded floor, by pillars about four feet high. They produced &s;ome of their palm-wine, which was the fre&s;h unfermented juice of the tree; it had a &s;weet, but not a di&s;agreeable ta&s;te; and hopes were conceived that it might contribute to recover our &s;ick from the &s;curvy. Soon after it was dark, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solan|der returned on board.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 19.</NOTE>In the morning of the 19th, I went a&s;hore with Mr. Banks, and &s;everal of the officers and Gentlemen, to return the King's vi&s;it; but my chief bu&s;ine&s;s was to procure &s;ome of the buffaloes, &s;heep and fowls, which we had been told &s;hould be driven down to the beach. We were greatly mor|tified to find that no &s;teps had been taken to fulfil this pro|mi&s;e; however, we proceeded to the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, which with two or three more had been erected by the Dutch Ea&s;t India company, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by two pieces of wood re&s;embling a pair of cow's horns, one of which is &s;et up at each end of the ridge that termi|nates the roof; and the&s;e were certainly what the Indian in|tended to repre&s;ent by cro&s;&s;ing his fingers, though our Por|tugue&s;e, who was a good Catholic, con&s;trued the &s;ign into a
<PB N="675" REF="280">
cro&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Wedne&s;. 19.</NOTE> which had per&s;uaded us that the &s;ettlement belonged to his countrymen. In this place we met Mr. Lange, and the King, who&s;e name was A Madocho Lomi Djara, attended by many of the principal people. We told them that we had in the boat goods of various kinds, which we propo&s;ed to barter for &s;uch refre&s;hments as they would give us in ex|change, and de&s;ired leave to bring them on &s;hore; which being granted, they were brought a&s;hore accordingly. We then attempted to &s;ettle the price of the buffaloes, &s;heep, hogs, and other commodities which we propo&s;ed to pur|cha&s;e, and for which we were to pay in money; but as &s;oon as this was mentioned Mr. Lange left us, telling us that the&s;e preliminaries mu&s;t be &s;ettled with the natives: he &s;aid, however, that he had received a letter from the Governor of Concordia in Timor, the purport of which he would com|municate to us when he returned.</P>
<P>As the morning was now far advanced, and we were very unwilling to return on board and eat &s;alt provi&s;ions, when &s;o many delicacies &s;urrounded us a&s;hore, we petitioned his Maje&s;ty for liberty to purcha&s;e a &s;mall hog and &s;ome rice, and to employ his &s;ubjects to dre&s;s them for us. He an|&s;wered very graciou&s;ly, that if we could eat victuals dre&s;&s;ed by his &s;ubjects, which he could &s;carcely &s;uppo&s;e, he would do him&s;elf the honour of entertaining us. We expre&s;&s;ed our gratitude, and immediately &s;ent on board for liquors.</P>
<P>About five o'clock, dinner was ready; it was &s;erved in &s;ix and thirty di&s;hes, or rather ba&s;kets, containing alternately rice and pork; and three bowls of earthen ware, filled with the liquor in which the pork had been boiled: the&s;e were ranged upon the floor, and mats laid round them for us to &s;it upon. We were then conducted by turns to a hole in the floor, near which &s;tood a man with water in a ve&s;&s;el, made
<PB N="676" REF="281">
of the leaves of the fan-palm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Wedne&s;. 19.</NOTE> who a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in wa&s;hing our hands. When this was done, we placed our&s;elves round the victuals, and waited for the king. As he did not come, we enquired for him, and were told that the cu&s;tom of the country did not permit the per&s;on who gave the entertain|ment to &s;it down with his gue&s;ts; but that, if we &s;u&s;pected the victuals to be poi&s;oned, he would come and ta&s;te it. We immediately declared that we had no &s;uch &s;u&s;picion, and de&s;ired that none of the rituals of ho&s;pitality might be vio|lated on our account. The prime mini&s;ter and Mr. Lange were of our party, and we made a mo&s;t luxurious meal: we thought the pork and rice excellent, and the broth not to be de&s;pi&s;ed; but the &s;poons, which were made of leaves, were &s;o &s;mall that few of us had patience to u&s;e them. After dinner, our wine pa&s;&s;ed bri&s;kly about, and we again enquired for our royal ho&s;t, thinking that though the cu&s;tom of his coun|try would not allow him to eat with us, he might at lea&s;t &s;hare in the jollity of our bottle; but he again excu&s;ed him|&s;elf, &s;aying, that the ma&s;ter of a fea&s;t &s;hould never be drunk, which there was no certain way to avoid but by not ta&s;ting the liquor. We did not however drink our wine where we had eaten our victuals; but as &s;oon as we had dined made room for the &s;eamen and &s;ervants, who immediately took our places: they could not di&s;patch all that we had left, but the women who came to clear away the bowls and ba&s;kets, obliged them to carry away with them what they had not eaten. As wine generally warms and opens the heart, we took an opportunity, when we thought its influence began to be felt, to revive the &s;ubject of the buffaloes and &s;heep, of which we had not in all this time heard a &s;yllable, though they were to have been brought down early in the morning. But our Saxon Dutchman, with great phlegm, began to commu|nicate to us the contents of the letter which he pretended to

have received from the Governor of Concordia. He &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Wedne&s;. 19.</NOTE> that after acquainting him that a ve&s;&s;el had &s;teered from thence towards the i&s;land where we were now a&s;hore, it re|quired him, if &s;uch &s;hip &s;hould apply for provi&s;ions in di&s;|tre&s;s, to relieve her; but not to &s;uffer her to &s;tay longer than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, nor to make any large pre&s;ents to the inferior people, or to leave any with tho&s;e of &s;uperior rank to be afterwards di&s;tributed among them: but he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to add, that we were at liberty to give beads and other trifles in exchange for petty civilities, and palm-wine.</P>
<P>It was the general opinion that this letter was a fiction; that the prohibitory orders were feigned with a view to get money from us for breaking them; and that by precluding our liberality to the natives, this man hoped more ea&s;ily to turn it into another channel.</P>
<P>In the evening, we received intelligence from our trading-place that no buffaloes or hogs had been brought down, and only a few &s;heep, which had been taken away before our people, who had &s;ent for money, could procure it. Some fowls however had been bought, and a large quantity of a kind of &s;yrup made of the juice of the palm tree, which, though infinitely &s;uperior to mola&s;&s;es or treacle, &s;old at a very low price. We complained of our di&s;appointment to Mr. Lange, who had now another &s;ubterfuge; he &s;aid, that if we had gone down to the beach our&s;elves, we might have purcha&s;ed what we plea&s;ed; but that the natives were afraid to take money of our people, le&s;t it &s;hould be counterfeit. We could not but feel &s;ome indignation again&s;t a man who had concealed this, being true; or alleged it, being fal&s;e. I &s;tarted up, however, and went immediately to the beach, but no cattle or &s;heep were to be &s;een, nor were any at hand

to be produced.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Wedne&s;. 19.</NOTE> While I was gone, Lange, who knew well enough that I &s;hould &s;ucceed no better than my people, told Mr. Banks that the natives were di&s;plea&s;ed at our not having offered them gold for their &s;tock; and that if gold was not offered, nothing would be bought. Mr. Banks did not think it worth his while to reply, but &s;oon after ro&s;e up, and we all returned on board, very much di&s;&s;atisfied with the i&s;&s;ue of our negociations. During the cour&s;e of the day, the King had promi&s;ed that &s;ome cattle and &s;heep &s;hould be brought down in the morning, and had given a rea&s;on for our di&s;appointment &s;omewhat more plau&s;ible; he &s;aid that the buffaloes were far up the country, and that there had not been time to bring them down to the beach.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 20.</NOTE>The next morning we went a&s;hore again: Dr. Solander went up to the town to &s;peak to Lange, and I remained upon the beach, to &s;ee what could be done in the purcha&s;e of provi|&s;ions. I found here an old Indian, who, as he appeared to have &s;ome authority, we had among our&s;elves called the Prime Mini&s;ter; to engage this man in our intere&s;t I pre|&s;ented him with a &s;pying-gla&s;s, but I &s;aw nothing at mar|ket except one &s;mall buffalo. I enquired the price of it, and was told five guineas: this was twice as much as it was worth; however, I offered three, which I could perceive the man who treated with me thought a good price; but he &s;aid that he mu&s;t acquaint the King with what I had offered be|fore he could take it. A me&s;&s;enger was immediately di&s;|patched to his Maje&s;ty, who &s;oon returned, and &s;aid, that the buffalo would not be &s;old for any thing le&s;s than five guineas. This price I ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to give; and another me&s;&s;en|ger was &s;ent away with an account of my refu&s;al: this me&s;|&s;enger was longer ab&s;ent than the other, and while I was waiting for his return I &s;aw, to my great a&s;toni&s;hment, Dr.

Solander coming from the town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Thur&s;day 20.</NOTE> followed by above a hun|dred men, &s;ome armed with mu&s;quets and &s;ome with lan|ces. When I enquired the meaning of this ho&s;tile appear|ance, the Doctor told me, that Mr. Lange had interpreted to him a me&s;&s;age from the King, purporting that the people would not trade with us, becau&s;e we had refu&s;ed to give them more than half the value of what they had to &s;ell; and that we &s;hould not be permitted to trade upon any terms longer than this day. Be&s;ides the officers who commanded the party, there came with it a man who was born at Timor, of Portugue&s;e parents, and who, as we afterwards di&s;co|vered, was a kind of colleague to the Dutch factor; by this man what they pretended to be the King's order was deli|vered to me, of the &s;ame purport with that which Dr. So|lander had received from Lange. We were all clearly of opinion that this was a mere artifice of the factors to extort money from us, for which we had been prepared by the account of a letter from Concordia; and while we were he|&s;itating what &s;tep to take, the Portugue&s;e, that he might the &s;ooner accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e, began to drive away the people who had brought down poultry and &s;yrup, and others that were now coming in with buffaloes and &s;heep. At this time, I glanced my eye upon the old man whom I had com|plimented in the morning with the &s;pying-gla&s;s, and I thought, by his looks, that he did not heartily approve of what was doing; I therefore took him by the hand, and pre|&s;ented him with an old broad &s;word. This in&s;tantly turned the &s;cale in our favour; he received the &s;word with a tran|&s;port of joy, and flouri&s;hing it over the bu&s;y Portugue&s;e, who crouched like a fox to a lion, he made him, and the officer who commanded the party, &s;it down upon the ground behind him: the people, who, whatever were the crafty pretences of the&s;e iniquitous factors for a Dutch company,
<PB N="680" REF="285">
were eager to &s;upply us with whatever we wanted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Thur&s;day 20.</NOTE> and &s;eemed al&s;o to be more de&s;irous of goods than money, in|&s;tantly improved the advantage that had been procured them, and the market was &s;tocked almo&s;t in an in&s;tant. To e&s;tabli&s;h a trade for buffaloes, however, which I mo&s;t wanted, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to give ten guineas for two, one of which weighed no more than a hundred and &s;ixty pounds; but I bought &s;even more much cheaper, and might after|wards have purcha&s;ed as many as I plea&s;ed almo&s;t upon my own terms, for they were now driven down to the water|&s;ide in herds. In the fir&s;t two that I bought &s;o dear, Lange had certainly a &s;hare, and it was in hopes to obtain part of the price of others, that he had pretended we mu&s;t pay for them in gold. The natives however &s;old what they after|wards brought down much to their &s;ati&s;faction, without pay|ing part of the price to him as a reward for exacting money from us. Mo&s;t of the buffaloes that we bought, after our friend, the Prime Mini&s;ter, had procured us a fair market, were &s;old for a mu&s;quet apiece, and at this price we might have bought as many as would have freighted our &s;hip.</P>
<P>The refre&s;hments which we procured here, con&s;i&s;ted of nine buffaloes, &s;ix &s;heep, three hogs, thirty dozen of fowls, a few limes, and &s;ome cocoa-nuts; many dozen of eggs, half of which however proved to be rotten; a little garlic, and &s;everal hundred gallons of palm-&s;yrup.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> A particular De&s;cription of the I&s;land of Savu, its Produce and Inhabitants, with a Specimen of their Language.</HEAD>
<P>THIS i&s;land is called by the natives SAVU;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> the middle of it lies in about the latitude 10&deg; 35&prime; S., longitude 237&deg; 30&prime; W.; and has in general been &s;o little known that I never &s;aw a map or chart in which it is clearly or accurately laid down. I have &s;een a very old one, in which it is called Sou, and confounded with Sandel Bo&s;ch. Rumphius mentions an i&s;land by the name of Saow; and he al&s;o &s;ays that it is the &s;ame which the Dutch call Sandel Bo&s;ch: but neither is this i&s;land, nor Timor, nor Rotte, nor indeed any one of the i&s;lands that we have &s;een in the&s;e &s;eas, placed within a rea&s;onable di&s;tance of its true &s;ituation. It is about eight leagues long from ea&s;t to we&s;t; but what is its breadth, I do not know, as I &s;aw only the north &s;ide. The harbour in which we lay is called Seba, from the di&s;trict in which it lies: it is on the north we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, and well &s;heltered from the &s;outh we&s;t trade wind, but it lies open to the north we&s;t. We were told, that there were two other bays where &s;hips might anchor; that the be&s;t, called Timo, was on the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;outh ea&s;t point: of the third we learnt neither the name nor &s;ituation. The &s;ea-coa&s;t, in general, is low; but in the middle of the i&s;land there are hills of a con&s;ide|rable height. We were upon the coa&s;t at the latter end of the dry &s;ea&s;on, when there had been no rain for &s;even months; and we were told that when the dry &s;ea&s;on conti|nues
<PB N="682" REF="287">
&s;o long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> there is no running &s;tream of fre&s;h water upon the whole i&s;land, but only &s;mall &s;prings, which are at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;ea-&s;ide: yet nothing can be imagined &s;o beautiful as the pro&s;pect of the coun|try from the &s;hip. The level ground next to the &s;ea-&s;ide was covered with cocoa-nut trees, and a kind of palm called <HI>Arecas</HI>; and beyond them the hills, which ro&s;e in a gentle and regular a&s;cent, were richly clothed, quite to the &s;ummit, with plantations of the fan-palm, forming an al|mo&s;t impenetrable grove. How much even this pro&s;pect mu&s;t be improved, when every foot of ground between the trees is covered with verdure, by maize, and millet and in|dico, can &s;carcely be conceived but by a powerful imagina|tion, not unacquainted with the &s;tateline&s;s and beauty of the trees that adorn this part of the earth. The dry &s;ea&s;on com|mences in March or April, and ends in October or November.</P>
<P>The principal trees of this i&s;land, are the fan-palm, the cocoa-nut, tamarind, limes, oranges, and mangoes; the other vegetable productions are maize, Guinea corn, rice, millet, callevances, and water-melons. We &s;aw al&s;o one &s;ugar-cane, and a few kinds of European garden-&s;tuff; par|ticularly cellery, marjoram, fennel, and garlic. For the &s;up|ply of luxury, it has betele, areca, tobacco, cotton, indico, and a &s;mall quantity of cinnamon, which &s;eems to be planted here only for curio&s;ity; and indeed we doubted whether it was the genuine plant, knowing that the Dutch are very careful not to tru&s;t the &s;pices out of their proper i&s;lands. There are however &s;everal kinds of fruit, be&s;ides tho&s;e which have been already mentioned; particularly the &s;weet &s;op, which is well known to the We&s;t Indians, and a &s;mall oval fruit, called the <HI>Blimbi,</HI> both of which grow upon trees. The blimbi is about three or four inches long, and
<PB N="683" REF="288">
in the middle about as thick as a man's finger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> tapering to|wards each end: it is covered with a very thin &s;kin of a light green colour, and in the in&s;ide are a few feeds di&s;po&s;ed in the form of a &s;tar: its flavour is a light, clean, plea&s;ant acid, but it cannot be eaten raw; it is &s;aid to be excellent as a pickle; and &s;tewed, it made a mo&s;t agreeable &s;our &s;auce to our boiled di&s;hes.</P>
<P>The tame animals are buffaloes, &s;heep, goats, hogs, fowls, pigeons, hor&s;es, a&s;&s;es, dogs and cats; and of all the&s;e there is great plenty. The buffaloes differ very con&s;iderably from the horned cattle of Europe in &s;everal particulars; their ears are much larger, their &s;kins are almo&s;t without hair, their horns are curved towards each other, but together bend di|rectly backwards, and they have no dewlaps. We &s;aw &s;e|veral that were as big as a well grown European ox, and there mu&s;t be &s;ome much larger; for Mr. Banks &s;aw a pair of horns which mea&s;ured from tip to tip three feet nine inches and an half, acro&s;s their wide&s;t diameter four feet one inch and an half, and in the whole &s;weep of their &s;emi|circle in front &s;even feet &s;ix inches and a half. It mu&s;t however be ob&s;erved, that a buffalo here of any given &s;ize, does not weigh above half as much as an ox of the &s;ame &s;ize in England: tho&s;e that we gue&s;&s;ed to weigh four hun|dred weight did not weigh more than two hundred and fifty; the rea&s;on is, that &s;o late in the dry &s;ea&s;on the bones are very thinly covered with fle&s;h: there is not an ounce of fat in a whole carca&s;s, and the flanks are literally nothing but &s;kin and bone: the fle&s;h however is well ta&s;ted and juicy, and I &s;uppo&s;e better than the fle&s;h of an Engli&s;h ox would be if he was to &s;tarve in this &s;un-burnt country.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es are from eleven to twelve hands high, but though they are &s;mall, they are &s;pirited and nimble, e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="684" REF="289">
in pacing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> which is their common &s;tep: the inhabi|tants generally ride them without a &s;addle, and with no better bridle than a halter. The &s;heep are of the kind which in England are called Bengal &s;heep, and differ from ours in many particulars. They are covered with hair in|&s;tead of wool, their ears are very large, and hang down under their horns, and their no&s;es are arched; they are thought to have a general re&s;emblance to a goat, and for that rea&s;on are frequently called <HI>cabritos:</HI> their fle&s;h we thought the wor&s;t mutton we had ever eaten, being as lean as that of the buffalo's, and without flavour. The hogs, however, were &s;ome of the fatte&s;t we had ever &s;een, though, as we were told, their principal food is the out&s;ide hu&s;ks of rice, and the palm &s;yrup di&s;&s;olved in water. The fowls are chiefly of the game breed, and large, but the eggs are re|markably &s;mall.</P>
<P>Of the fi&s;h which the &s;ea produces here, we know but little: turtles are &s;ometimes found upon the coa&s;t, and are by the&s;e people, as well as all others, con&s;idered as a dainty.</P>
<P>The people are rather under, than over the middling &s;ize; the women e&s;pecially are remarkably &s;hort and &s;quat built: their complexion is a dark brown, and their hair univer&s;ally black and lank. We &s;aw no difference in the colour of rich and poor, though in the South Sea i&s;lands tho&s;e that were expo&s;ed to the weather were almo&s;t as brown as the New Hollanders, and the better &s;ort nearly as fair as the natives of Europe. The men are in general well-made, vigorous, and active, and have a greater variety in the make and di&s;|po&s;ition of their features than u&s;ual; the countenances of the women, on the contrary, are all alike.</P>
<P>The men fa&s;ten their hair up to the top of their heads with a comb, the women tie it behind in a club, which is
<PB N="685" REF="290">
very far from becoming.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> Both &s;exes eradicate the hair from under the arm, and the men do the &s;ame by their beards, for which purpo&s;e, the better &s;ort always carry a pair of &s;ilver pincers hanging by a &s;tring round their necks; &s;ome however &s;uffer a very little hair to remain upon their upper lips, but this is always kept &s;hort.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of both &s;exes con&s;i&s;ts of cotton cloth, which being died blue in the yarn, and not uniformly of the &s;ame &s;hade, is in clouds or waves of that colour, and even in our eye had not an inelegant appearance. This cloth they ma|nufacture them&s;elves, and two pieces, each about two yards long, and a yard and a half wide, make a dre&s;s: one of them is worn round the middle, and the other covers the upper part of the body: the lower edge of the piece that goes round the middle, the men draw pretty tight ju&s;t below the fork, the upper edge of it is left loo&s;e, &s;o as to form a kind of hollow belt, which &s;erves them as a pocket to carry their knives, and other little implements which it is conve|nient to have about them. The other piece of cloth is pa&s;&s;ed through this girdle behind, and one end of it being brought over the left &s;houlder, and the other over the right, they fall down over the brea&s;t, and are tucked into the girdle before, &s;o that by opening or clo&s;ing the plaits, they can cover more or le&s;s of their bodies as they plea&s;e; the arms, legs, and feet are always naked. The difference between the dre&s;s of the two &s;exes con&s;i&s;ts principally in the manner of wearing the wai&s;t-piece, for the women, in&s;tead of draw|ing the lower edge tight, and leaving the upper edge loo&s;e for a pocket, draw the upper edge tight, and let the lower edge fall as low as the knees, &s;o as to form a petticoat; the body-piece, in&s;tead of being pa&s;&s;ed through the girdle, is fa&s;tened under the arms, and cro&s;s the brea&s;t, with the utmo&s;t decency. I have already ob&s;erved, that the men fa&s;ten the
<PB N="686" REF="291">
hair upon the top of the head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> and the women tie it in a club behind, but there is another difference in the head|dre&s;s, by which the &s;exes are di&s;tingui&s;hed: the women wear nothing as a &s;uccedaneum for a cap, but the men con|&s;tantly wrap &s;omething round their heads in the manner of a fillet; it is &s;mall, but generally of the fine&s;t materials that can be procured: we &s;aw &s;ome who applied &s;ilk handker|chiefs to this purpo&s;e, and others that wore fine cotton, or mu&s;lin, in the manner of a &s;mall turban.</P>
<P>The&s;e people bore their te&s;timony that the love of finery is a univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion, for their ornaments were very nume|rous. Some of the better &s;ort wore chains of gold round their necks, but they were made of plaited wire, and con|&s;equently were light and of little value; others had rings, which were &s;o much worn that they &s;eemed to have de&s;cend|ed through many generations; and one per&s;on had a &s;ilver-headed cane, marked with a kind of cypher, con&s;i&s;ting of the Roman letters V, O, C, and therefore probably a pre&s;ent from the Dutch Ea&s;t India Company, who&s;e mark it is: they have al&s;o ornaments made of beads, which &s;ome wear round their necks as a &s;olitaire, and others, as bracelets, upon their wri&s;ts: the&s;e are common to both &s;exes, but the women have be&s;ides, &s;trings or girdles of beads, which they wear round their wai&s;ts, and which &s;erve to keep up their petti|coat. Both &s;exes had their ears bored, nor was there a &s;ingle exception that fell under our notice, yet we never &s;aw an or|nament in any of them; we never indeed &s;aw either man or woman in any thing but what appeared to be their ordinary dre&s;s, except the King and his mini&s;ter, who in general wore a kind of night-gown of coar&s;e chintz, and one of whom once received us in a black robe, which appeared to be made of what is called prince's &s;tuff. We &s;aw &s;ome boys, about twelve or fourteen years old, who had &s;piral circles
<PB N="687" REF="292">
of thick bra&s;s wire pa&s;&s;ed three or four times round their arms, above the elbow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> and &s;ome men wore rings of ivory, two inches in breadth, and above an inch in thick|ne&s;s, upon the &s;ame part of the arm: the&s;e, we were told, were the &s;ons of the Rajas, or Chiefs, who wore the&s;e cum|brous ornaments as badges of their high birth.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the men had their names traced upon their arms, in indelible characters of a black colour, and the women had a &s;quare ornament of flouri&s;hed lines, impre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, ju&s;t under the bend of the elbow. We were &s;truck with the &s;imilitude between the&s;e marks, and tho&s;e made by tattowing in the South Sea i&s;lands, and upon enquiring into its origin, we learnt that it had been practi&s;ed by the natives long before any Europeans came among them; and that in the neighbouring i&s;lands the inhabitants were marked with circles upon their necks and brea&s;ts. The univer&s;ality of this practice, which prevails among &s;avages in all parts of the world, from the remote&s;t limits of North America, to the i&s;lands in the South Seas, and which pro|bably differs but little from the method of &s;taining the body that was in u&s;e among the ancient inhabitants of Britain, is a curious &s;ubject of &s;peculation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the account which Mr. Bo&s;&s;u has given of &s;ome Indians who inhabit the banks of the Akanza, a river of North America, which ri&s;es in New Mexico, and falls into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, he relates the following incident: "The Akanzas, &s;ays he, have adopted me, and as a mark of my privilege, have imprinted the figure of a roe-buck upon my thigh, which was done in this manner: an Indian having burnt &s;ome &s;traw, diluted the a&s;hes with water, and with this mixture, drew the figure upon my &s;kin; he then retraced it, by pricking the lines with needles, &s;o as at every puncture ju&s;t to draw the blood, and the blood mixing with the a&s;hes of the &s;traw, forms a figure which can never be effaced," See Travels through Loui&s;iana, vol. i. p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of Savu are all built upon the &s;ame plan, and differ only in &s;ize, being large in proportion to the rank and
<PB N="688" REF="293">
riches of the proprietor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> Some are four hundred feet long, and &s;ome are not more than twenty: they are all rai&s;ed upon po&s;ts, or piles, about four feet high, one end of which is driven into the ground, and upon the other end is laid a &s;ub&s;tantial floor of wood, &s;o that there is a vacant &s;pace of four feet between the floor of the hou&s;e and the ground. Upon this floor are placed other po&s;ts or pillars, that &s;upport a roof of &s;loping &s;ides, which meet in a ridge at the top, like tho&s;e of our barns: the eaves of this roof, which is thatched with palm leaves, reach within two feet of the floor, and over-hang it as much: the &s;pace within is gene|rally divided lengthwi&s;e into three equal parts; the middle part, or center, is inclo&s;ed by a partition of four &s;ides, reach|ing about &s;ix feet above the floor, and one or two &s;mall rooms are al&s;o &s;ometimes taken off from the &s;ides, the re&s;t of the &s;pace under the roof is open, &s;o as freely to admit the air and the light: the particular u&s;es of the&s;e different apart|ments, our &s;hort &s;tay would not permit us to learn, except that the clo&s;e room in the center was appropriated to the women.</P>
<P>The food of the&s;e people con&s;i&s;ts of every tame animal in the country, of which the hog holds the fir&s;t place in their e&s;timation, and the hor&s;e the &s;econd; next to the hor&s;e is the buffalo, next to the buffalo their poultry, and they prefer dogs and cats to &s;heep and goats. They are not fond of fi&s;h, and, I believe, it is never eaten but by the poor people, nor by them, except when their duty or bu&s;ine&s;s requires them to be upon the beach, and then every man is furni&s;hed with a light ca&s;ting net, which is girt round him, and makes part of his dre&s;s; and with this he takes any &s;mall fi&s;h which happen to come in his way.</P>
<P>The ae&s;culent vegetables and fruits have been mentioned already, but the fan-palm requires more particular notice,
<PB N="689" REF="294">
for at certain times it is a &s;uccedaneum for all other food both to man and bea&s;t. A kind of wine, called toddy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> is procured from this tree, by cutting the buds which are to produce flowers, &s;oon after their appearance, and tying under them &s;mall ba&s;kets, made of the leaves, which are &s;o clo&s;e as to hold liquids without leaking. The juice which trickles into the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, is collected by per&s;ons who climb the trees for that purpo&s;e, morning and evening, and is the common drink of every individual upon the i&s;land; yet a much greater quantity is drawn off than is con&s;umed in this u&s;e, and of the &s;urplus they make both a &s;yrup and coar&s;e &s;ugar. The liquor is called <HI>dua,</HI> or <HI>duac,</HI> and both the &s;yrup and &s;ugar, <HI>gula.</HI> The &s;yrup is prepared by boiling the liquor down in pots of earthen ware, till it is &s;ufficiently in&s;pi&s;&s;ated; it is not unlike treacle in appearance, but is &s;omewhat thicker, and has a much more agreeable ta&s;te: the &s;ugar is of a reddi&s;h brown, perhaps the &s;ame with the Jugata &s;ugar upon the continent of India, and it was more agreeable to our palates than any cane &s;ugar, unrefined, that we had ever ta&s;ted. We were at fir&s;t afraid that the &s;yrup, of which &s;ome of our people eat very great quantities, would have brought on fluxes, but its aperient quality was &s;o very &s;light, that what effect it produced was rather &s;alutary than hurt|ful. I have already ob&s;erved, that it is given with the hu&s;ks of rice to the hogs, and that they grow enormou&s;ly fat with|out taking any other food: we were told al&s;o, that this &s;yrup is u&s;ed to fatten their dogs and their fowls, and that the in|habitants them&s;elves have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon this alone for &s;everal months, when other crops have failed, and animal food has been &s;carce. The leaves of this tree are al&s;o put to various u&s;es, they thatch hou&s;es, and make ba&s;kets, cups, umbrellas, and tobacco-pipes. The fruit is lea&s;t e&s;teemed, and as the blo&s;&s;oms are wounded for the tuac or toddy, there
<PB N="690" REF="295">
is not much of it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> it is about as big as a large turnip, and covered, like the cocoa-nut, with a fibrous coat, under which are three kernels, that mu&s;t be eaten before they are ripe, for afterwards they become &s;o hard that they cannot be chewed; in their eatable &s;tate they ta&s;te not unlike a green cocoa-nut, and, like them, probably they yield a nutriment that is watry and un&s;ub&s;tantial.</P>
<P>The common method of dre&s;&s;ing food here is by boiling, and as fire-wood is very &s;carce, and the inhabitants have no other fuel, they make u&s;e of a contrivance to &s;ave it, that is not wholly unknown in Europe, but is &s;eldom practi&s;ed ex|cept in camps. They dig a hollow under ground, in a hori|zontal direction, like a rabbit burrow, about two yards long, and opening into a hole at each end, one of which is large and the other &s;mall: by the large hole the fire is put in, and the &s;mall one &s;erves for a draught. The earth over this burrow is perforated by circular holes, which communicate with the cavity below; and in the&s;e holes are &s;et earthen pots, generally about three to each fire, which are large in the middle, and taper towards the bottom, &s;o that the fire acts upon a large part of their &s;urface. Each of the&s;e pots generally contains about eight or ten gallons, and it is &s;ur|pri&s;ing to &s;ee with how &s;mall a quantity of &s;ire they may be kept boiling; a palm leaf, or a dry &s;talk, thru&s;t in now and then, is &s;ufficient: in this manner they boil all their victuals, and make all their &s;yrup and &s;ugar. It appears by Frazier's account of his voyage to the South Sea, that the Peruvian Indians have a contrivance of the &s;ame kind, and perhaps it might be adopted with advantage by the poor people even of this country, where fuel is very dear.</P>
<P>Both &s;exes are en&s;laved by the hateful and pernicious habit of chewing beetle and areca, which they contract even while
<PB N="691" REF="296">
they are children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> and practi&s;e ince&s;&s;antly from morning till night. With the&s;e they always mix a kind of white lime, made of coral &s;tone and &s;hells, and frequently a &s;mall quan|tity of tobacco, &s;o that their mouths are di&s;gu&s;tful in the highe&s;t degree both to the &s;mell and the fight: the tobacco taints their breath, and the beetle and lime make the teeth not only as black as charcoal, but as rotten too. I have &s;een men between twenty and thirty, who&s;e fore teeth have been con&s;umed almo&s;t down to the gums, though no two of them were exactly of the &s;ame length or thickne&s;s, but irregularly corroded like iron by ru&s;t. This lo&s;s of teeth is, I think, by all who have written upon the &s;ubject, imputed to the tough and &s;tringy coat of the areca nut; but I impute it wholly to the lime: they are not loo&s;ened, or broken, or forced out, as might be expected if they were injured by the continual chewing of hard and rough &s;ub&s;tances, but they are gra|dually wa&s;ted like metals that are expo&s;ed to the action of powerful acids; the &s;tumps always adhering firmly to the &s;ocket in the jaw, when there is no part of the tooth above the gums: and po&s;&s;ibly tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ugar has a bad effect upon the teeth of Europeans, may not be mi&s;taken, for it is well known that refined loaf &s;ugar contains a con|&s;iderable quantity of lime; and he that doubts whether lime will de&s;troy bone of any kind, may ea&s;ily a&s;certain the fact by experiment.</P>
<P>If the people here are at any time without this odious mouthful, they are &s;moking. This operation they perform by rolling up a &s;mall quantity of tobacco, and putting it into one end of a tube about &s;ix inches long, and as thick as a goo&s;e quill, which they make of a palm leaf. As the quan|tity of tobacco in the&s;e pipes is very &s;mall, the effect of it is increa&s;ed, e&s;pecially among the women, by &s;wallowing the &s;moke.</P>
<P><PB N="692" REF="297"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE>When the natives of this i&s;land were fir&s;t formed into a civil &s;ociety, is not certainly known, but at pre&s;ent it is divided into five principalities or nigrees: LAAI, SEBA, REGEEUA, TIMO, and MASSARA, each of which is governed by its re&s;pective Raja or King. The Raja of Seba, the prin|cipality in which we were a&s;hore, &s;eemed to have great au|thority, without much external parade or &s;how, or much appearance of per&s;onal re&s;pect. He was about five and thirty years of age, and the fatte&s;t man we &s;aw upon the whole i&s;land: he appeared to be of a dull phlegmatic di&s;po&s;ition, and to be directed almo&s;t implicitly by the old man who, upon my pre&s;enting him with a &s;word, had procured us a fair market, in &s;pight of the craft and avarice of the Dutch factors. The name of this per&s;on was MANNU DJARME, and it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed that he was a man of uncom|mon integrity and abilities, as, notwith&s;tanding his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of power in the character of a favourite, he was beloved by the whole principality. If any difference ari&s;es among the people, it is &s;ettled by the Raja and his coun&s;ellors, with|out delay or appeal, and, as we were told, with the mo&s;t &s;olemn deliberation and impartial ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>We were informed by Mr. Lange, that the chiefs who had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pre&s;ided over the five principalities of this i&s;land, had lived for time immemorial in the &s;tricte&s;t alliance and mo&s;t cordial friend&s;hip with each other; yet he &s;aid the people were of a warlike di&s;po&s;ition, and had always cou|rageou&s;ly defended them&s;elves again&s;t foreign invaders. We were told al&s;o, that the i&s;land was able to rai&s;e, upon very &s;hort notice, 7300 fighting men, armed with mu&s;kets, &s;pears, lances, and targets. Of this force, Laai was &s;aid to furni&s;h 2600, Seba 2000, Regeeua 1500, Timo 800, and Ma&s;&s;a~ra~ 400. Be&s;ides the arms that have been already men|tioned, each man is furni&s;hed with a large pole-ax, re&s;em|bling
<PB N="693" REF="298">
a wood-bill, except that it has a &s;trait edge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> and is much heavier: this, in the hands of people who have cou|rage to come to clo&s;e quarters with an enemy, mu&s;t be a dreadful weapon; and we were told that they were &s;o dex|terous with their lances, that at the di&s;tance of &s;ixty feet they would throw them with &s;uch exactne&s;s as to pierce a man's heart, and &s;uch force as to go quite through his body.</P>
<P>How far this account of the martial prowe&s;s of the inha|bitants of Savu may be true, we cannot take upon us to determine, but during our &s;tay, we &s;aw no appearance of it. We &s;aw indeed in the town-hou&s;e, or hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, about one hundred &s;pears and targets, which &s;erved to arm the people who were &s;ent down to intimidate us at the trading place; but they &s;eemed to be the refu&s;e of old ar|mories, no two being of the &s;ame make or length, for &s;ome were &s;ix, and &s;ome &s;ixteen feet long: we &s;aw no lance among them, and as to the mu&s;kets, though they were clean on the out&s;ide, they were eaten into holes by the ru&s;t within; and the people them&s;elves appeared to be &s;o little acquainted with military di&s;cipline, that they marched like a di&s;orderly rabble, every one having, in&s;tead of his target, a cock, &s;ome tobacco, or other merchandi&s;e of the like kind, which he took that opportunity to bring down to &s;ell, and few or none of their cartridge boxes were furni&s;hed with either powder or ball, though a piece of paper was thru&s;t into the hole to &s;ave appearances. We &s;aw a few &s;wivel guns, and pateraros at the town-hou&s;e, and a great gun before it; but the &s;wivels and pateraros lay out of their carriages, and the great gun lay upon a heap of &s;tones, almo&s;t con&s;umed with ru&s;t, with the touch-hole downwards, po&s;&s;ibly to conceal its &s;ize, which might perhaps be little le&s;s than that of the bore.</P>
<P><PB N="694" REF="299"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE>We could not di&s;cover that among the&s;e people there was any rank of di&s;tinction between the Raja and the land-owners: the land-owners were re&s;pectable in proportion to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; the inferior ranks con&s;i&s;t of manufacturers, labouring poor, and &s;laves. The &s;laves, like the pea&s;ants in &s;ome parts of Europe, are connected with the e&s;tate, and both de&s;cend together: but though the land-owner can &s;ell his &s;lave, he has no other power over his per&s;on, not even to correct him, without the privity and approbation of the Raja. Some have five hundred of the&s;e &s;laves, and &s;ome not half a dozen: the common price of them is a fat hog. When a great man goes out, he is con&s;tantly attended by two or more of them: one of them carries a &s;word or hanger, the hilt of which is commonly of &s;ilver, and adorned with large ta&s;&s;els of hor&s;e hair; and another carries a bag which contains betel, areca, lime, and tobacco. In the&s;e attendants con&s;i&s;ts all their magnificence, for the Raja him&s;elf has no other mark of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The chief object of pride among the&s;e people, like that of a Welchman, is a long pedigree of re&s;pectable ance&s;tors, and indeed a veneration for antiquity &s;eems to be carried farther here than in any other country: even a hou&s;e that has been well inhabited for many generations, becomes almo&s;t &s;acred, and few articles either of u&s;e or luxury bear &s;o high a price as &s;tones, which having been long &s;at upon, are become even and &s;mooth: tho&s;e who can purcha&s;e &s;uch &s;tones, or are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them by inheritance, place them round their hou&s;es, where they &s;erve as &s;eats for their dependants.</P>
<P>Every Raja &s;ets up in the principal town of his province, or nigree, a large &s;tone, which &s;erves as a memorial of his reign. In the principal town of Seba, where we lay, there are thirteen &s;uch &s;tones, be&s;ides many fragments of others,
<PB N="695" REF="300">
which had been &s;et up in earlier times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> and are now mould|ering away: the&s;e monuments &s;eem to prove that &s;ome kind of civil e&s;tabli&s;hment here is of con&s;iderable antiquity. The la&s;t thirteen reigns in England make &s;omething more than 276 years.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e &s;tones are &s;o large, that it is difficult to con|ceive by what means they were brought to their pre&s;ent &s;tation, e&s;pecially as it is the &s;ummit of a hill; but the world is full of memorials of human &s;trength, in which the me|chanical powers that have been &s;ince added by mathematical &s;cience, &s;eem to be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed; and of &s;uch monuments there are not a few among the remains of barbarous anti|quity in our own country, be&s;ides tho&s;e upon Sali&s;bury plain.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;tones not only record the reigns of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive princes, but &s;erve for a purpo&s;e much more extraordinary, and probably altogether peculiar to this country. When a Raja dies, a general fea&s;t is proclaimed throughout his do|minions, and all his &s;ubjects a&s;&s;emble round the&s;e &s;tones; almo&s;t every living creature that can be caught is then killed, and the fea&s;t la&s;ts for a le&s;s or greater number of weeks or months, as the kingdom happens to be more or le&s;s furni&s;hed with live &s;tock at the time; the &s;tones &s;erve for tables. When this madne&s;s is over, a fa&s;t mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue, and the whole kingdom is obliged to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon &s;yrup and water, if it happens in the dry &s;ea&s;on, when no vegetables can be procured, till a new &s;tock of animals can be rai&s;ed from the few that have e&s;caped by chance, or been pre&s;erved by policy from the general ma&s;&s;acre, or can be procured from the neighbouring kingdoms. Such, how|ever, is the account that we received from Mr. Lange.</P>
<P><PB N="696" REF="301"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE>We had no opportunity to examine any of their manufac|tures, except that of their cloth, which they &s;pin, weave, and dye; we did not indeed &s;ee them employed, but many of the in&s;truments which they u&s;e fell in our way. We &s;aw their machine for clearing cotton of its &s;eeds, which is made upon the &s;ame principles as tho&s;e in Europe, but is &s;o &s;mall that it might be taken for a model, or a toy: it con&s;i&s;ts of two cylinders, like our round rulers, &s;omewhat le&s;s than an inch in diameter, one of which, being turned round by a plain winch, turns the other by means of an endle&s;s worm; and the whole machine is not more than fourteen inches long, and &s;even high: that which we &s;aw had been much u&s;ed, and many pieces of cotton were hanging about it, &s;o that there is no rea&s;on to doubt its being a fair &s;pecimen of the re&s;t. We al&s;o once &s;aw their apparatus for &s;pinning; it con&s;i&s;ted of a bobbin, on which was wound a &s;mall quantity of thread, and a kind of di&s;taff filled with cotton; we con|jectured therefore that they &s;pin by hand, as the women of Europe did before the introduction of wheels; and I am told that they have not yet found their way into &s;ome parts of it. Their loom &s;eemed to be in one re&s;pect preferable to ours, for the web was not &s;tretched upon a frame, but extended by a piece of wood at each end, round one of which the cloth was rolled, and round the other the threads: the web was about half a yard broad, and the length of the &s;huttle was equal to the breadth of the web, &s;o that probably their work goes on but &s;lowly. That they dyed this cloth we fir&s;t gue&s;&s;ed from its colour, and from the indigo which we &s;aw in their plantations; and our conjecture was afterwards con|firmed by Mr. Lange's account. I have already ob&s;erved, that it is dyed in the yarn, and we once law them dying what was &s;aid to be girdles for the women, of a dirty red, but with what drug we did not think it worth while to enquire.</P>
<P><PB N="697" REF="302">The religion of the&s;e people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> according to Mr. Lange's in|formation, is an ab&s;urd kind of pagani&s;m, every man chu|&s;ing his own god, and determining for him&s;elf how he &s;hould be wor&s;hipped; &s;o that there are almo&s;t as many gods and modes of wor&s;hip as people. In their morals, however, they are &s;aid to be irreproachable, even upon the principles of Chri&s;tianity: no man is allowed more than one wife; yet an illicit commerce between the &s;exes is in a man|ner unknown among them: in&s;tances of theft are very rare; and they are &s;o far from revenging a &s;uppo&s;ed injury by murder, that if any difference ari&s;es between them, they will not &s;o much as make it the &s;ubject of debate, le&s;t they &s;hould be provoked to re&s;entment and ill-will, but immedi|ately and implicity refer it to the determination of their King.</P>
<P>They appeared to be a healthy and long-lived people; yet &s;ome of them were marked with the &s;mall-pox, which Mr. Lange told us had &s;everal times made its appearance among them, and was treated with the &s;ame precautions as the plague. As &s;oon as a per&s;on was &s;eized with the di&s;temper, he was removed to &s;ome &s;olitary place, very remote from any habitation, where the di&s;ea&s;e was left to take its cour&s;e, and the patient &s;upplied with daily food by reaching it to him at the end of a long pole.</P>
<P>Of their dome&s;tic oeconomy we could learn but little: in one in&s;tance however their delicacy and cleanline&s;s are very remarkable. Many of us were a&s;hore here three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days, from a very early hour in the morning till it was dark; yet we never &s;aw the lea&s;t trace of an offering to Cloacina, nor could we &s;o much as gue&s;s where they were made. In a country &s;o populous this is very difficult to be accounted
<PB N="698" REF="303">
for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> and perhaps there is no other country in the world where the &s;ecret is &s;o effectually kept.</P>
<P>The boats in u&s;e here are a kind of proa.</P>
<P>This i&s;land was &s;ettled by the Portugue&s;e almo&s;t as &s;oon as they fir&s;t found their way into this part of the ocean; but they were in a &s;hort time &s;upplanted by the Dutch. The Dutch however did not take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, but only &s;ent &s;loops to trade with the natives, probably for provi&s;ions to &s;upport the inhabitants of their &s;pice i&s;lands, who applying them&s;elves wholly to the cultivation of that important article of trade, and laying out all their ground in plantations, can breed few animals: po&s;&s;ibly their &s;upplies by this occasional traf|fic were precarious; po&s;&s;ibly they were jealous of being &s;up|planted in their turn; but however that be, their Ea&s;t India Company, about ten years ago, entered into a treaty with the Rajas, by which the Company &s;tipulated to furni&s;h each of them with a certain quantity of &s;ilk, fine linen, cutlery ware, arrack and other articles, every year; and the Rajas engaged that neither they nor their &s;ubjects &s;hould trade with any per&s;on except the company, without having fir&s;t obtained their con&s;ent, and that they would admit a re&s;ident on behalf of the Company, to re&s;ide upon the i&s;land, and &s;ee that their part of the treaty was fulfilled: they al&s;o en|gaged to &s;upply annually a certain quantity of rice, maize, and calevances. The maize and calevances are &s;ent to Ti|mor in &s;loops, which are kept there for that purpo&s;e, each of which is navigated by ten Indians; and the rice is fetched away annually by a &s;hip which brings the Company's re|turns, and anchors alternately in each of the three bays. The&s;e returns are delivered to the Rajas in the form of a pre&s;ent, and the ca&s;k of arrack they and their principal
<PB N="699" REF="304">
people never cea&s;e to drink,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> as long as a drop of it re|mains.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this treaty, the Dutch placed three per|&s;ons upon the i&s;land: Mr. Lange, his colleague, the native of Timor, the &s;on of an Indian woman by a Portugue&s;e, and one Frederick Craig, the &s;on of an Indian woman by a Dutchman. Lange vi&s;its each of the Rajas once in two months, when he makes the tour of the i&s;land, attended by fifty &s;laves on hor&s;eback. He exhorts the&s;e Chiefs to plant, if it appears that they have been remi&s;s, and ob&s;erves where the crops are got in, that he may order &s;loops to fetch it; &s;o that it pa&s;&s;es immediately from the ground to the Dutch &s;torehou&s;es at Timor. In the&s;e excur&s;ions he always carries with him &s;ome bottles of arrack, which he finds of great u&s;e in opening the hearts of the Rajas with whom he is to deal.</P>
<P>During the ten years that he had re&s;ided upon this i&s;land he had never &s;een a European be&s;ides our&s;elves, except at the arrival of the Dutch &s;hip, which had &s;ailed about two months before we arrived; and he is now to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the natives only by his colour and his dre&s;s, for he &s;its upon the ground, chews his betele, and in every re&s;pect has adopted their character and manners: he has married an Indian woman of the i&s;land of Timor, who keeps his hou&s;e after the fa&s;hion of her country; and he gave that as a rea|&s;on for not inviting us to vi&s;it him, &s;aying, that he could entertain us in no other manner than the Indians had done, and he &s;poke no language readily but that of the country.</P>
<P>The office of Mr. Frederic Craig is to in&s;truct the youth of the country in reading and writing, and the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion; the Dutch having printed ver&s;ions of the New Te&s;tament, a catechi&s;m, and &s;everal other tracts,
<PB N="700" REF="305">
in the language of this and the neighbouring i&s;lands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> Dr. Solander, who was at his hou&s;e, &s;aw the books, and the copy|books al&s;o, of his &s;cholars, many of whom wrote a very fair hand. He boa&s;ted that there were no le&s;s than &s;ix hundred Chri&s;tians in the town&s;hip of Seba; but what the Dutch Chri&s;tianity of the&s;e Indians may be, it is not perhaps very ea&s;y to gue&s;s, for there is not a church, nor even a prie&s;t, in the whole i&s;land.</P>
<P>While we were at this place, we made &s;everal enquiries concerning the neighbouring i&s;lands, and the intelligence which we received, is to the following effect:</P>
<P>A &s;mall i&s;land to the we&s;tward of Savu, the name of which we did not learn, produces nothing of any con&s;equence but areca-nuts, of which the Dutch receive annually the freight of two &s;loops, in return for pre&s;ents that they make to the i&s;landers.</P>
<P>Timor is the chief, and the Dutch re&s;idents on the other i&s;lands go thither once a year to pa&s;s their accounts. The place is nearly in the &s;ame &s;tate as in Dampier's time, the Dutch having there a fort and &s;torehou&s;es; and by Lange's account we might there have been &s;upplied with every ne|ce&s;&s;ary that we expected to procure at Batavia, &s;alt provi&s;ions and arrack not excepted. But the Portugue&s;e are &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal towns on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land, particularly Laphao and Se&s;ial.</P>
<P>About two years before our arrival, a French &s;hip was wrecked upon the ea&s;t coa&s;t of Timor; and after &s;he had lain &s;ome days upon the &s;hoal, a &s;udden gale broke her up at once, and drowned the Captain, with the greate&s;t part of the crew: tho&s;e who got a&s;hore, among whom was one of the Lieutenants, made the be&s;t of their way to Concordia; they were four days upon the road, where they were ob|liged
<PB N="705" REF="306">
to leave part of their company through fatigue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE> and the re&s;t, to the number of about eighty, arrived at the town. They were &s;upplied with every nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;ent back to the wreck, with proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for recovering what could be fi&s;hed up: they fortunately got up all their bullion, which was in che&s;ts, and &s;everal of their guns, which were very large. They then returned to the town, but their compa|nions who had been left upon the road were mi&s;&s;ing, hav|ing, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed, been kept among the Indians, either by per&s;ua&s;ion or force; for they are very de&s;irous of having Europeans among them, to in&s;truct them in the art of war. After a &s;tay of more than two months at Concordia, their number was dimini&s;hed nearly one half by &s;ickne&s;s, in con|&s;equence of the fatigue and hard&s;hip which they had &s;uf|fered by the &s;hipwreck, and the &s;urvivors were &s;ent in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el to Europe.</P>
<P>Rotte is in much the &s;ame &s;ituation as Savu; a Dutch fac|tor re&s;ides upon it to manage the natives, and look after its produce, which con&s;i&s;ts, among other articles, of &s;ugar. Formerly it was made only by brui&s;ing the canes, and boil|ing the juice to a &s;yrup, in the &s;ame manner as Toddy; but great improvements have lately been made in preparing this valuable commodity. The three little i&s;lands called the Solars are al&s;o under the influence of the Dutch &s;ettlement at Concordia: they are flat and low, but abound with provi|&s;ions of every kind, and the middlemo&s;t is &s;aid to have a good harbour for &s;hipping. Ende, another little i&s;land to the we&s;tward of the Solars, is &s;till in the hands of the Por|tugue&s;e, who have a good town and harbour on the north ea&s;t corner of it called Larntuca: they had formerly an har|bour on the &s;outh &s;ide of it, but that, being much inferior to Larntuca, has for &s;ome time been altogether neglected.</P>
<P><PB N="702" REF="307"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September.</NOTE>The inhabitants of each of the&s;e little i&s;lands &s;peak a lan|guage peculiar to them&s;elves, and it is an object of Dutch policy to prevent, as much as po&s;&s;ible, their learning the language of each other. If they &s;poke a common language, they would learn, by a mutual intercour&s;e with each other, to plant &s;uch things as would be of more value to them|&s;elves than their pre&s;ent produce, though of le&s;s advantage to the Dutch; but their languages being different, they can communicate no &s;uch knowlege to each other, and the Dutch &s;ecure to them&s;elves the benefit of &s;upplying their &s;everal nece&s;&s;ities upon their own terms, which it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e are not very moderate. It is probably with a view to this advantage that the Dutch never teach their own lan|guage to the natives of the&s;e i&s;lands, and have been at the expence of tran&s;lating the Te&s;tament and catechi&s;ms into the different languages of each; for in proportion as Dutch had become the language of their religion, it would have be|come the common language of them all.</P>
<P>To this account of Savu, I &s;hall only add a &s;mall &s;pecimen of its language, by which it will appear to have &s;ome affi|nity with that of the South Sea i&s;lands, many of the words being exactly the &s;ame, and the numbers manife&s;tly derived from the &s;ame &s;ource.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September Friday 21.</NOTE>IN the morning of Friday the 21&s;t of September, 1770, we got under &s;ail, and &s;tood away to the we&s;tward, along the north &s;ide of the i&s;land of Savu, and of the &s;maller that lies to the we&s;tward of it, which at noon bore from us S.S.E. di&s;tant two leagues. At four o'clock in the afternoon, we di&s;covered a &s;mall low i&s;land, bearing S. S. W. di&s;tant three leagues, which has no place in any chart now extant, at lea&s;t in none that I have been able to procure: it lies in lati|tude 10&deg; 47&prime; S., longitude 238&deg; 28&prime; W.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 22.</NOTE>At noon on the 22d, we were in latitude 11&deg; 10&prime; S., longi|tude 240&deg; 38&prime; W.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 23.</NOTE> In the evening of the 23d, we found the variation of the needle to be 2&deg; 44&prime; W.; as &s;oon as we got clear of the i&s;lands we had con&s;tantly a &s;well from the &s;outh|ward, which I imagined was not cau&s;ed by a wind blowing from that quarter, but by the &s;ea being &s;o determined by the po&s;ition of the coa&s;t of New Holland.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 24. Tue&s;day 25. Wedne&s;. 26.</NOTE>At noon on the 26th, being in latitude 10&deg; 47&prime; S., longi|tude 249&deg; 52&prime; W. we found the variation to be 3&deg; 10&prime; W. and our &s;ituation to be twenty-five miles to the northward of the log; for which I know not how to account. At noon on the 27th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 27.</NOTE> our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 10&deg; 51&prime; S. which was agreeable to the log; and our longitude was 252&deg; 11&prime; W. We &s;teered N. W. all day on the 28th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 28.</NOTE> in order to make the
<PB N="705" REF="310">
land of Java; and at noon on the 29th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. September. Saturday 29. Sunday 30.</NOTE> our latitude by ob&s;er|vation was 9&deg; 31&prime; S., longitude 254&deg; 10&prime; W.; and in the morn|ing of the 30th, I took into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the log-book an journals, at lea&s;t all I could find, of the officers, petty offi|cers, and &s;eamen, and enjoined them &s;ecrecy with re&s;pect to where they had been.</P>
<P>At &s;even in the evening, being in the latitude of Java Head, and not &s;eeing any land, I concluded that we were too far to the we&s;tward: I therefore hauled up E. N. E. having before &s;teered N. by E. In the night, we had thunder and lightning; and about twelve o'clock, by the light of the fla&s;hes, we &s;aw the land bearing ea&s;t. I then tacked and &s;tood to the S. W. till four o'clock in the morning of the 1&s;t of October; and at &s;ix, Java Head, or the we&s;t end of Java,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October. Monday 1.</NOTE> bore S. E. by E. di&s;tant five leagues: &s;oon after we &s;aw Prince's I&s;land, bearing E. &frac12; S.; and at ten, the i&s;land of Cra|catoa, bearing N.E. Cracatoa is a remarkably high-peaked i&s;land, and at noon it bore N. 40 E. di&s;tant &s;even leagues.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now ob&s;erve that, during our run from Savu, I al|lowed twenty minutes a-day for the we&s;terly current, which I concluded mu&s;t run &s;trong at this time, e&s;pecially off the coa&s;t of Java, and I found that this allowance was ju&s;t equi|valent to the effect of the current upon the &s;hip.</P>
<P>At four o'clock in the morning of the 2d,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 2.</NOTE> we fetched clo&s;e in with the coa&s;t of Java, in fifteen fathom; we then &s;tood along the coa&s;t, and early in the forenoon, I &s;ent the boat a&s;hore to try if &s;he could procure &s;ome fruit for Tupia, who was very ill, and &s;ome gra&s;s for the buffaloes that were &s;till alive. In an hour or two &s;he returned with four cocoa-nuts, and a &s;mall bunch of plantains, which had been purcha&s;ed for a &s;hilling, and &s;ome herbage for the cattle, which the In|dians not only gave us, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted our people to cut. The
<PB N="706" REF="311">
country looked like one continued wood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. October. Tue&s;day 2.</NOTE> and had a very plea&s;ant appearance.</P>
<P>About eleven o'clock, we &s;aw two Dutch &s;hips lying off Anger point, and I &s;ent Mr. Hicks on board of one of them to enquire news of our country, from which we had been ab&s;ent &s;o long. In the mean time it fell calm, and about noon I anchored in eighteen fathom with a muddy bottom. When Mr. Hicks returned, he reported that the &s;hips were Dutch Ea&s;t Indiamen from Batavia, one of which was bound to Ceylon, and the other to the coa&s;t of Malabar; and that there was al&s;o a flyboat or packet, which was &s;aid to be &s;ta|tioned here to carry letters from the Dutch &s;hips that came hither to Batavia, but which I rather think was appointed to examine all &s;hips that pa&s;s the &s;treight: from the&s;e &s;hips we heard, with great plea&s;ure, that the Swallow had been at Batavia about two years before.</P>
<P>At &s;even o'clock a breeze &s;prung up at S. S. W. with which having weighed, we &s;tood to the N. E. between Thwart-the-way-I&s;land and the Cap, &s;ounding from eighteen to twenty-eight fathom: we had but little wind all night, and having a &s;trong current again&s;t us, we got no further by eight in the morning than Bantam Point.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 3.</NOTE> At this time the wind came to the N. E. and obliged us to anchor in two and twenty fathom, at about the di&s;tance of two miles from the &s;hore; the point bore N. E. by E. di&s;tant one league, and here we found a &s;trong current &s;etting to the N. W. In the morning we had &s;een the Dutch packet &s;tanding after us, but when the wind &s;hifted to the N. E. &s;he bore away.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the evening, the wind having obliged us to continue at anchor, one of the country boats came along &s;ide of us, on board of which was the Ma&s;ter of the packet. He &s;eemed to have two motives for his vi&s;it, one to take an
<PB N="707" REF="312">
account of the &s;hip, and the other to &s;ell us refre&s;hments;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. October. Wedne&s;. 3.</NOTE> for in the boat were turtle, fowls, ducks, parrots, paroquets, rice-birds, monkies, and other articles, which they held at a very high price, and brought to a bad market, for our Savu &s;tock was not yet expended: however, I gave a Spani&s;h dol|lar for a &s;mall turtle, which weighed about &s;ix and thirty pounds; I gave al&s;o a dollar for ten large fowls, and after|wards bought fifteen more at the &s;ame price; for a dollar we might al&s;o have bought two monkies, or a whole cage of rice-birds. The Ma&s;ter of the &s;loop brought with him two books, in one of which he de&s;ired that any of our offi|cers would write down the name of the &s;hip and its Com|mander, with that of the place from which &s;he &s;ailed, and of the port to which &s;he was bound, with &s;uch other parti|culars relating to them&s;elves, as they might think proper, for the information of any of our friends that &s;hould come after us: and in the other he entered the names of the &s;hip and the Commander, him&s;elf, in order to tran&s;mit them to the Governor and Council of the Indies. We perceived that in the fir&s;t book many &s;hips, particularly Portugue&s;e, had made entries of the &s;ame kind with that for which it was pre|&s;ented to us. Mr. Hicks, however, having written the name of the &s;hip, only added "from Europe." He took notice of this, but &s;aid, that he was &s;atisfied with any thing we thought fit to write, it being intended merely for the infor|mation of tho&s;e who &s;hould enquire after us from motives of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Having made &s;everal attempts to &s;ail with a wind that would not &s;tem the current, and as often come to an an|chor, a proa came along&s;ide of us in the morning of the 5th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 5.</NOTE> in which was a Dutch officer, who &s;ent me down a printed paper in Engli&s;h, duplicates of which he had in other lan|guages,
<PB N="708" REF="313">
particularly in French and Dutch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. October. Friday 5.</NOTE> all regularly &s;igned, in the name of the Governor and Council of the In|dies, by their &s;ecretary: it contained nine que&s;tions, very ill expre&s;&s;ed, in the following terms:</P>

<P>Of the&s;e que&s;tions I an&s;wered only the fir&s;t and the fourth; which when the officer &s;aw, he &s;aid an&s;wers to the re&s;t were of no con&s;equence: yet he immediately added, that he mu&s;t &s;end that very paper away to Batavia, and that it would be there the next day at noon. I have particularly related this
<PB N="709" REF="314">
incident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. October. Friday 5.</NOTE> becau&s;e I have been credibly informed that it is but of late years that the Dutch have taken upon them to exa|mine &s;hips that pa&s;s through this Streight.</P>
<P>At ten o'clock the &s;ame morning, we weighed, with a light breeze at S. W.; but did little more than &s;tem the current, and about two o'clock anchored again under Bantam Point, where we lay till nine; a light breeze then &s;pringing up at S.E. we weighed and &s;tood to the ea&s;tward till ten o'clock the next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 6.</NOTE> when the current obliged us again to anchor in twenty-two fathom, Pulababi bearing E. by S. &frac12; S. di&s;tant between three and four miles. Having alternately weighed and anchored &s;everal times, till four in the afternoon of the 7th, we then &s;tood to the ea&s;tward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 7.</NOTE> with a very faint breeze at N. E. and pa&s;&s;ed Wapping I&s;land, and the fir&s;t i&s;land to the ea&s;tward of it; when the wind dying away, we were carried by the current between the fir&s;t and &s;econd of the i&s;lands that lie to the ea&s;tward of Wapping I&s;land, were we were obliged to anchor in thirty fathom, being very near a ledge of rocks that run out from one of the i&s;lands. At two the next morning we weighed with the land wind at &s;outh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 8.</NOTE> and &s;tood out clear of the &s;hoal; but before noon were obliged to come to again in twenty-eight fathom, near a &s;mall i&s;land among tho&s;e that are called the Thou&s;and I&s;lands, which we did not find laid down in any chart. Pulo Pare at this time bore E. N. E. di&s;tance between &s;ix and &s;even miles.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went a&s;hore upon the i&s;land, which they found not to be more than five hundred yards long, and one hundred broad; yet there was a hou&s;e upon it, and a &s;mall plantation, where among other things was the <HI>Palma Chri&s;ti,</HI> from which the ca&s;tor oil is made in the We&s;t Indies: they made a &s;mall addition to their collection of plants, and &s;hot a bat, who&s;e wings when extended mea|&s;ured
<PB N="710" REF="315">
three feet from point to point:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. October. Monday 8.</NOTE> they &s;hot al&s;o four plo|vers, which exactly re&s;embled the golden plover of England. Soon after they returned, a &s;mall Indian boat came along&s;ide with two Malays on board, who brought three turtles, &s;ome dried fi&s;h, and a few pumpkins: we bought the turtle, which altogether weighed a hundred and forty-&s;ix pounds, for a dollar, and con&s;idering that we had lately paid the Dutchman a dollar for one that weighed only &s;ix and thirty pounds, we thought we had a good bargain. The &s;eller ap|peared equally &s;atisfied, and we then treated with him for his pumpkins, for which he was very unwilling to take any money but a dollar; we laid that a whole dollar was greatly too much; to which he readily a&s;&s;ented, but de&s;ired that we would cut one and give him a part: at la&s;t, however, a fine &s;hining Portugue&s;e petacka tempted him, and for that he &s;old us his whole &s;tock of pumpkins, being in number twenty-&s;ix. At parting, he made &s;igns that we &s;hould not tell at Batavia that any boat had been aboard us.</P>
<P>We were not able to weather Pulo Pare this day, but get|ting the land wind at &s;outh about ten o'clock at night, we weighed and &s;tood to the E. S. E. all night. At ten in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 9.</NOTE> we anchored again, to wait for the &s;ea breeze; and at noon it &s;prung up at N.N.E. with which we &s;tood in for Batavia road, where at four o'clock in the afternoon we came to an anchor.</P>
<P>We found here the Harcourt Indiaman from England, two Engli&s;h private traders of that country, thirteen &s;ail of large Dutch &s;hips, and a con&s;iderable number of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. A boat came immediately on board, from a &s;hip which had a broad pendant flying, and the officer who commanded hav|ing enquired who we were, and whence we came, immedi|ately returned with &s;uch an&s;wers as we thought fit to give
<PB N="711" REF="316">
him: both he and his people were as pale as &s;pectres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. October. Tue&s;day 9.</NOTE> a &s;ad pre&s;age of our &s;ufferings in &s;o unhealthy a country; but our people, who, except Tupia, were all ro&s;y and plump, &s;eemed to think them&s;elves &s;o &s;ea&s;oned by various climates that nothing could hurt them. In the mean time, I &s;ent a Lieutenant a&s;hore to acquaint the Governor of our arrival, and to make an excu&s;e for our not &s;aluting; for as I could &s;alute with only three guns, except the &s;wivels, which I was of opinion would not be heard, I thought it was better to let it alone. As &s;oon as the boat was di&s;patched the carpenter delivered me an account of the defects of the &s;hip, of which the following is a copy:</P>
<Q><P>The defects of his Maje&s;ty's bark Endeavour, Lieutenant James Cook Commander.</P>
<P>The &s;hip very leaky, as &s;he makes from twelve to &s;ix inches water an hour, occa&s;ioned by her main keel being wounded in many places, and the &s;carfs of her &s;tern being very open: the fal&s;e keel gone beyond the mid&s;hips from forward, and perhaps farther, as I had no opportunity of &s;eeing for the water when hauled a&s;hore for repairing: wounded on the larboard &s;ide under the main channel, where I imagine the greate&s;t leak is, but could not come at it for the water: one pump on the larboard &s;ide u&s;ele&s;s; the others decayed within an inch and an half of the bore. Otherwi&s;e ma&s;ts, yards, boats, and hull, in pretty good condition.</P></Q>
<P>As it was the univer&s;al opinion that the &s;hip could not &s;afely proceed to Europe without an examination of her bot|tom, I determined to apply for leave to heave her down at this place; and as I under&s;tood that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to make this application in writing, I drew up a reque&s;t, and
<PB N="712" REF="317">
the next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. October. Wedne&s;. 10.</NOTE> having got it tran&s;lated into Dutch, we all went a&s;hore.</P>
<P>We repaired immediately to the hou&s;e of Mr. Leith, the only Engli&s;hman of any credit who is re&s;ident at this place; he received us with great politene&s;s, and engaged us to dinner: to this gentleman we applied for in&s;tructions how to provide our&s;elves with lodgings and nece&s;&s;aries while we &s;hould &s;tay a&s;hore, and he told us, that there was a hotel, or kind of inn, kept by the order of government, where all merchants and &s;trangers were obliged to re&s;ide, paying half per cent upon the value of their goods for warehou&s;e room, which the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e was obliged to provide; but that as we came in a King's &s;hip, we &s;hould be at liberty to live where we plea&s;ed, upon a&s;king the Governor's permi&s;|&s;ion, which would be granted of cour&s;e. He &s;aid, that it would be cheaper for us to take a hou&s;e in the town, and bring our own &s;ervants a&s;hore, if we had any body upon whom we could depend to buy in our provi&s;ions; but as this was not the ca&s;e, having no per&s;on among us who could &s;peak the Malay language, our gentlemen determined to go to the hotel. At the hotel, therefore, beds were immediately hired, and word was &s;ent that we &s;hould &s;leep there at night.</P>
<P>At five o'clock in the afternoon, I was introduced to the Governor-General, who received me very courteou&s;ly; he told me, that I &s;hould have every thing I wanted, and that in the morning my reque&s;t &s;hould be laid before the coun|cil, which I was de&s;ired to attend.</P>
<P>About nine o'clock, we had a dreadful &s;torm of thunder, lightning, and rain, during which the main-ma&s;t of one of the Dutch Ea&s;t Indiamen was &s;plit, and carried away by the deck; the main-top-ma&s;t and top-gallant-ma&s;t were &s;hivered

This &s;hip lay not more than the di&s;tance of two cables' length from ours, and in all probability we &s;hould have &s;hared the &s;ame fate, but for the electrical chain which we had but ju&s;t got up, and which conducted the lightning over the &s;ide of the &s;hip; but though we e&s;caped the lightning, the explo&s;ion &s;hook us like an earthquake, the chain at the &s;ame time ap|pearing like a line of fire: a centinel was in the action of charging his piece, and the &s;hock forced the mu&s;ket out of his hand, and broke the rammer rod. Upon this occa&s;ion, I cannot but earne&s;tly recommend chains of the &s;ame kind to every &s;hip, whatever be her de&s;tination, and I hope that the fate of the Dutchman will be a warning to all who &s;hall read this narrative, again&s;t having an iron &s;pindle at the ma&s;t-head.</P>
<P>The next morning, I attended at the council-chamber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 11.</NOTE> and was told that I &s;hould have every thing I wanted. In the mean time, the gentlemen a&s;hore agreed with the keeper of the hotel for their lodging and board, at the rate of two rix-dollars, or nine &s;hillings &s;terling a day for each; and as there were five of them, and they would probably have many vi&s;itors from the &s;hip, he agreed to keep them a &s;eparate table, upon condition that they &s;hould pay one rix-dollar for the dinner of every &s;tranger, and another for his &s;upper and bed, if he &s;hould &s;leep a&s;hore. Under this &s;tipulation they were to be furni&s;hed with tea, coffee, punch, pipes and to|bacco, for them&s;elves and their friends, as much as they could con&s;ume; they were al&s;o to pay half a rupee, or one &s;hilling and three pence a day for each of their &s;ervants.</P>
<P>They &s;oon learnt that the&s;e rates were more than double the common charges of board and lodging in the town, and
<PB N="714" REF="319">
their table,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. October. Thur&s;day 11.</NOTE> though it had the appearance of magnificence, was wretchedly &s;erved. Their dinner con&s;i&s;ted of one cour&s;e of fifteen di&s;hes, and their &s;upper of one cour&s;e of thirteen, but nine or ten of them con&s;i&s;ted of bad poultry, variou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed, and often &s;erved up the &s;econd, third, and even the fourth time: the &s;ame duck having appeared more than once roa&s;ted, found his way again to the table as a frica&s;ee, and a fourth time in the form of forced meat. It was not long, however, before they learnt that this treatment was only by way of e&s;&s;ay, and that it was the invariable cu&s;tom of the hou&s;e, to &s;upply all &s;trangers, at their fir&s;t coming, with &s;uch fare as could be procured for the lea&s;t money, and con|&s;equently would produce the mo&s;t gain: that if either through indolence or good-nature they were content, it was continued for the benefit of the ho&s;t, but that if they com|plained, it was gradually amended till they were &s;atisfied, which &s;ometimes happened before they had the worth of their money. After this di&s;covery, they remon&s;trated, and their fare became better; however, after a few days, Mr. Banks hired a little hou&s;e, the next door on the left hand to the hotel, for him&s;elf and his party, for which he paid after the rate of ten rix-dollars, or two pounds five &s;hillings &s;ter|ling a month; but here they were very far from having either the convenience or the privacy which they expected; no per|&s;on was permitted to &s;leep in this private hou&s;e occa&s;ionally, as a gue&s;t to the per&s;on who hired it, under a penalty, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">amo&s;t every Dutchman that went by ran in without any ceremony, to a&s;k what they &s;old, there having been very &s;eldom any private per&s;ons at Batavia who had not &s;ome|thing to &s;ell. Every body here hires a carriage, and Mr. Banks hired two. They are open chai&s;es, made to hold two people, and driven by a man &s;itting on a coach-box; for each of the&s;e he paid two rix-dollars a day.</P>

He &s;oon came a&s;hore, with his boy Tayeto, and though while he was on board, and after he came into the boat, he was exceed|ingly li&s;tle&s;s and dejected, he no &s;ooner entered the town than he &s;eemed to be animated with a new &s;oul. The hou&s;es, carriages, &s;treets, people, and a multiplicity of other ob|jects, all new, which ru&s;hed upon him at once, produced an effect like the &s;udden and &s;ecret power that is imagined of fa&s;cination. Tayeto expre&s;&s;ed his wonder and delight with &s;till le&s;s re&s;traint, and danced along the &s;treet in a kind of exta&s;y, examining every object with a re&s;tle&s;s and eager curio&s;ity, which was every moment excited and gratified. One of the fir&s;t things that Tupia remarked, was the various dre&s;&s;es of the pa&s;&s;ing multitude, concerning which he made many enquiries; and when he was told that in this place, where people of many different nations were a&s;&s;embled, every one wore the habit of his country, he de&s;ired that he might conform to the cu&s;tom, and appear in that of Otaheite. South Sea cloth was therefore &s;ent for from the &s;hip, and he equipped him&s;elf with great expedition and dexterity. The people who had &s;een Otourou, the Indian who had been brought hither by M. Bougainville, enquired whether Tupia was not the &s;ame per&s;on: from the&s;e enquiries, we learnt who it was that we had &s;uppo&s;ed to be Spaniards, from the accounts that had been given of two &s;hips by the I&s;landers.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I procured an order to the &s;uperinten|dant of the i&s;land of Ouru&s;t, where the &s;hip was to be re|paired, to receive her there; and &s;ent by one of the &s;hips that &s;ailed for Holland, an account of our arrival here, to Mr. Stephens, the Secretary to the Admiralty.</P>
<P><PB N="716" REF="321"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. October. Thur&s;day 11.</NOTE>The expences that would be incurred by repairing and re|fitting the &s;hip, rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for me to take up money in this place, which I imagined might be done with|out difficulty, but I found my&s;elf mi&s;taken; for after the mo&s;t diligent enquiry, I could not find any private per&s;on that had ability and inclination to advance the &s;um that I wanted. In this difficulty I applied to the Governor him&s;elf, by a written reque&s;t, in con&s;equence of which, the Shebander had orders to &s;upply me with what money I &s;hould require out of the Company's Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 18.</NOTE>On the 18th, as &s;oon as it was light, having by &s;everal accidents and mi&s;takes &s;uffered a delay of many days, I took up the anchor, and ran down to Ouru&s;t: a few days after|wards, we went along-&s;ide of the wharf, on Cooper's I&s;land, which lies clo&s;e to Ouru&s;t, in order to take out our &s;tores.</P>
<P>By this time, having been here only nine days, we began to feel the fatal effects of the climate and &s;ituation. Tupia, after the flow of &s;pirits which the novelties of the place pro|duced upon his fir&s;t landing, &s;unk on a &s;udden, and grew every day wor&s;e and wor&s;e. Tayeto was &s;eized with an in|flammation upon his lungs, Mr. Banks's two &s;ervants became very ill, and him&s;elf and Dr. Solander were attacked by fevers: in a few days, almo&s;t every per&s;on both on board and a&s;hore was &s;ick; affected, no doubt, by the low &s;wampy &s;ituation of the place, and the numberle&s;s dirty canals which inter&s;ect the town in all directions. On the 26th, I &s;et up the tent for the reception of the &s;hip's company, of whom there was but a &s;mall number able to do duty. Poor Tupia, of who&s;e life we now began to de&s;pair, and who till this time had continued a&s;hore with Mr. Banks, de&s;ired to be re|moved to the &s;hip, where, he &s;aid, he &s;hould breathe a freer air than among the numerous hou&s;es which ob&s;tructed it

a&s;hore: on board the &s;hip, however, he could not go,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. October.</NOTE> for &s;he was unrigged, and preparing to be laid down at the careen|ing place; but on the 28th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 28.</NOTE> Mr. Banks went with him to Cooper's I&s;land, or, as it is called here, Kuypor, where &s;he lay, and as he &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the &s;pot, a tent was there pitched for him: at this place, both the &s;ea breeze and the land breeze blew directly over him, and he expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction in his &s;ituation. Mr. Banks, who&s;e huma|nity kept him two days with this poor Indian, returned to the town on the 30th, and the fits of his intermittent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 30.</NOTE> which was now become a regular tertian, were &s;o violent as to de|prive him of his &s;en&s;es while they la&s;ted, and leave him &s;o weak that he was &s;carcely able to crawl down &s;tairs: at this time, Dr. Solander's di&s;order al&s;o increa&s;ed, and Mr. Monk|hou&s;e, the Surgeon, was confined to his bed.</P>
<P>On the fifth of November,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November. Monday 5.</NOTE> after many delays in con&s;e|quence of the Dutch &s;hips coming along-&s;ide the wharfs to load pepper, the &s;hip was laid down, and the &s;ame day, Mr. Monkhou&s;e, our Surgeon, a &s;en&s;ible, &s;kilful man, fell the fir&s;t &s;acrifice to this fatal country, a lo&s;s which was greatly aggravated by our &s;ituation. Dr. Solander was ju&s;t able to attend his funeral, but Mr. Banks was confined to his bed. Our di&s;tre&s;s was now very great, and the pro&s;pect before us di&s;couraging in the highe&s;t degree: our danger was not &s;uch as we could &s;urmount by any efforts of our own; courage, &s;kill, and diligence were all equally ineffectual, and death was every day making advances upon us, where we could neither re&s;i&s;t nor fly. Malay &s;ervants were hired to attend the &s;ick, but they had &s;o little &s;en&s;e either of duty or huma|nity, that they could not be kept within call, and the patient was frequently obliged to get out of bed to &s;eek them. On the 9th, we lo&s;t our poor Indian boy Tayeto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 9.</NOTE> and Tupia was
<PB N="718" REF="323">
&s;o much affected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. November. Friday 9.</NOTE> that it was doubted whether he would &s;urvive till the next day.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the bottom of the &s;hip being examined, was found to be in a wor&s;e condition than we apprehended: the fal&s;e keel was all gone to within twenty feet of the &s;tern po&s;t; the main keel was con&s;iderably injured in many places; a great quantity of the &s;heathing was torn off, and &s;everal planks were much damaged; two of them, and the half of a third, under the main channel near the keel, were, for the length of &s;ix feet, &s;o worn, that they were not above an eighth part of an inch thick, and here the worms had made their way quite into the timbers; yet in this condition &s;he had &s;ailed many hundred leagues, where navigation is as dangerous as in any part of the world: how much mi&s;ery did we e&s;cape, by being ignorant that &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el was thinner than the &s;ole of a &s;hoe, and that every life on board depended upon &s;o &s;light and fragile a barrier between us and the unfathomable ocean! It &s;eemed, however, that we had been pre&s;erved only to peri&s;h here; Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were &s;o bad that the phy&s;ician declared they had no chance for recovery but by removing into the country; a hou&s;e was therefore hired for them, at the di&s;tance of about two miles from the town, which belonged to the ma&s;ter of the hotel, who engaged to furni&s;h them with provi&s;ions, and the u&s;e of &s;laves. As they had already experienced their want of influence over &s;laves that had other ma&s;ters, and the unfeeling inattention of the&s;e fellows to the &s;ick, they bought each of them a Mallay woman, which removed both the cau&s;es of their being &s;o ill &s;erved; the women were their own property, and the ten|derne&s;s of the &s;ex, even here, made them good nur&s;es. While the&s;e preparations were making, they received an
<PB N="719" REF="324">
account of the death of Tupia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. November.</NOTE> who &s;unk at once after the lo&s;s of the boy, whom he loved with the tenderne&s;s of a parent.</P>
<P>By the 14th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 14.</NOTE> the bottom of the &s;hip was thoroughly re|paired, and very much to my &s;atisfaction: it would, indeed, be inju&s;tice to the officers and workmen of this yard, not to declare that, in my opinion, there is not a marine yard in the world, where a &s;hip can be laid down with more conve|nience, &s;afety, and di&s;patch, nor repaired with more dili|gence and &s;kill. At this place they heave down by two ma&s;ts, a method which we do not now practi&s;e; it is, however, unque&s;tionably more &s;afe and expeditious to heave down with two ma&s;ts than one, and he mu&s;t have a good &s;hare of bigotry to old cu&s;toms, and an equal want of common &s;en&s;e, who will not allow this, after &s;eeing with what facility the Dutch heave down their large&s;t &s;hips at this place.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander recovered &s;lowly at their coun|try-hou&s;e, which was not only open to the &s;ea breeze, but &s;ituated upon a running &s;tream, which greatly contributed to the circulation of the air: but I was now taken ill my&s;elf; Mr. Sporing, and a &s;eaman who had attended Mr. Banks, were al&s;o &s;eized with intermittents; and indeed there was not more than ten of the whole &s;hip's company that were able to do duty.</P>
<P>We proceeded however in rigging the &s;hip, and getting water and &s;tores aboard: the water we were obliged to pro|cure from Batavia, at the rate of &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence a leager, or one hundred and fifty gallons.</P>
<P>About the 26th, the we&s;terly mon&s;oon &s;et in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 26.</NOTE> which gene|rally blows here in the night from the S. W. and in the day from the N. W. or N. For &s;ome nights before this, we had very heavy rain, with much thunder; and in the night be|tween
<PB N="720" REF="325">
the 25th and 26th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. November. Monday 26.</NOTE> &s;uch rain as we had &s;eldom &s;een, for near four hours without intermi&s;&s;ion. Mr. Banks's hou&s;e admitted the water in every part like a &s;ieve, and it ran through the lower rooms in a &s;tream that would have turned a mill: he was by this time &s;ufficiently recovered to go out, and upon his entering Batavia the next morning, he was much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the bedding every where hung out to dry.</P>
<P>The wet &s;ea&s;on was now &s;et in, though we had &s;ome in|tervals of fair weather. The frogs in the ditches, which croak ten times louder than any frogs in Europe, gave notice of rain by an ince&s;&s;ant noi&s;e that was almo&s;t intolerable, and the gnats and mu&s;quitos, which had been very trouble&s;ome even during the dry weather, were now become innu|merable, &s;warming from every pla&s;h of water like bees from a hive; they did not, however, much incommode us in the clay, and the &s;tings, however trouble&s;ome at fir&s;t, never continued to itch above half an hour, &s;o that none of us felt in the day, the effects of the wounds they had received in the night.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">December. Saturday 8.</NOTE>On the 8th of December, the &s;hip being perfectly refitted, and having taken in mo&s;t of her water and &s;tores, and re|ceived her &s;ick on board, we ran up to Batavia Road, and anchored in four fathom and an half of water.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 24.</NOTE>From this time, to the 24th, we were employed in getting on board the remainder of our water and provi&s;ions, with &s;ome new pumps, and in &s;everal other operations that were nece&s;&s;ary to fit the &s;hip for the &s;ea, all which would have been effected much &s;ooner, if &s;ickne&s;s and death had not di&s;|abled or carried off a great number of our men.</P>
<P>While we lay here, the Earl of Elgin, Captain Cook, a &s;hip belonging to the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India Company, came to an
<PB N="721" REF="326">
anchor in the Road. She was bound from Madra&s;s to China,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December. Monday 24.</NOTE> but having lo&s;t her pa&s;&s;age, put in here to wait for the next &s;ea&s;on. The Phoenix, Captain Black, an Engli&s;h country &s;hip, from Bencoolen, al&s;o came to an anchor at this place.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of Chri&s;tmas eve, the 24th, I took leave of the Governor, and &s;everal of the principal gentlemen of the place, with whom I had formed connections, and from whom I received every po&s;&s;ible civility and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but in the mean time an accident happened, which might have produced di&s;agreeable con&s;equences. A &s;eaman had run away from one of the Dutch &s;hips in the Road, and entered on board of mine: the Captain had applied to the Governor, to reclaim him as a &s;ubject of Holland, and an order for that purpo&s;e was procured: this order was brought to me &s;oon after I returned from my la&s;t vi&s;it, and I &s;aid, that if the man appeared to be a Dutchman, he &s;hould cer|tainly be delivered up. Mr. Hicks commanded on board, and I gave the Dutch officer an order to him, to deliver the man up under that condition. I &s;lept my&s;elf this night on &s;hore, and in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 25.</NOTE> the Captain of the Dutch Com|modore came and told me that he had carried my order on board, but that the officer had refu&s;ed to deliver up the man, alleging, not only that he was not a Dutchman, but that he was a &s;ubject of Great Britain, born in Ireland; I re|plied, that the officer had perfectly executed my orders, and that if the man was an Engli&s;h &s;ubject, it could not be ex|pected that I &s;hould deliver him up. The Captain then &s;aid, that he was ju&s;t come from the Governor, to demand the man of me in his name, as a &s;ubject of Denmark, alleging, that he &s;tood in the &s;hip's books as born at El&s;ineur. The claim of this man as a &s;ubject of Holland, being now given up, I ob&s;erved to the Captain, that there appeared to be &s;ome
<PB N="722" REF="327">
mi&s;take in the General's me&s;&s;age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December. Tue&s;day 26.</NOTE> for that he would certainly never demand a Dani&s;h &s;eaman from me, who had com|mitted no other crime than preferring the &s;ervice of the Engli&s;h to that of the Dutch. I added, however, to con|vince him of my &s;incere de&s;ire to avoid di&s;putes, that if the man was a Dane he &s;hould be delivered up as a courte&s;y, though he could not be demanded as a right; but that if I found he was an Engli&s;h &s;ubject, I would keep him at all events. Upon the&s;e terms we parted, and &s;oon after I re|ceived a letter from Mr. Hicks, containing indubitable proof that the &s;eaman in que&s;tion was a &s;ubject of his Britannic Ma|je&s;ty. This letter I immediately carried to the Shebander, with a reque&s;t that it might be &s;hewn to the Governor, and that his Excellency might at the &s;ame time be told, I would not upon any terms part with the man. This had the de&s;ired effect, and I heard no more of the affair.</P>
<P>In the evening, I went on board, accompanied by Mr. Banks, and the re&s;t of the gentlemen who had con&s;tantly re&s;ided on &s;hore, and who, though better, were not yet perfectly recovered.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 26.</NOTE>At &s;ix in the morning, of the 26th, we weighed and &s;et &s;ail, with a light breeze at S. W. The Elgin Indiaman &s;a|luted us with three cheers and thirteen guns, and the garri|&s;on with fourteen, both which, with the help of our &s;wivels, we returned, and &s;oon after the &s;ea breeze &s;et in at N. by W. which obliged us to anchor ju&s;t without the &s;hips in the Road.</P>
<P>At this time, the number of &s;ick on board amounted to forty, and the re&s;t of the &s;hip's company were in a very feeble condition. Every individual had been &s;ick except the &s;ail-maker, an old man between &s;eventy and eighty years of

age, and it is very remarkable that this old man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.

All but Tupia fell a &s;acrifice to the unwhole&s;ome, &s;tagnant, putrid air of the country, and he who from his birth had been u&s;ed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly upon vegetable food, particularly ripe fruit, &s;oon contracted all the di&s;orders that are incident to a &s;ea life, and would probably have &s;unk under them before we could have completed our voyage, if we had not been obliged to go to Batavia to refit.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE>BATAVIA, the capital of the Dutch dominions in India, and generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have no equal among all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Europeans in A&s;ia, is &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land of Java, in a low fenny plain, where &s;everal &s;mall rivers, which take their ri&s;e in the mountains called Blaeuwen Berg, about forty miles up the country, empty them|&s;elves into the &s;ea, and where the coa&s;t forms a large bay, called the Bay of Batavia, at the di&s;tance of about eight leagues from the &s;treight of Sunda. It lies in latitude 6&deg; 10&prime; S. and longitude 106&deg; 50&prime; E. from the meridian of Greenwich, as appears from a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations made upon the &s;pot, by the Reverend Mr. Mohr, who has built an elegant ob|&s;ervatory, which is as well furni&s;hed with in&s;truments as mo&s;t in Europe.</P>
<P>The Dutch &s;eem to have pitched upon this &s;pot for the convenience of water-carriage, and in that it is indeed a &s;econd Holland, and &s;uperior to every other place in the world. There are very few &s;treets that have not a canal of con&s;iderable breadth running through them, or rather &s;tag|nating in them, and continued for &s;everal miles in almo&s;t every direction beyond the town, which is al&s;o inter&s;ected by five or &s;ix rivers, &s;ome of which are navigable thirty or forty miles up the country. As the hou&s;es are large, and the &s;treets wide, it takes up a much greater extent, in pro|portion
<PB N="725" REF="330">
to the number of hou&s;es it contains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> than any city in Europe. Valentyn, who wrote an account of it about the year 1726, &s;ays, that in his time there were, within the walls, 1242 Dutch hou&s;es, and 1200 Chine&s;e; and without the walls 1066 Dutch, and 1240 Chine&s;e, be&s;ides 12 arrack hou&s;es, making in all 4760: but this account appeared to us to be greatly exaggerated, e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to the number of hou&s;es within the walls.</P>
<P>The &s;treets are &s;pacious and hand&s;ome, and the banks of the canals are planted with rows of trees, that make a very plea&s;ing appearance; but the trees concur with the canals to make the &s;ituation unwhole&s;ome. The &s;tagnant canals in the dry &s;ea&s;on exhale an intolerable &s;tench, and the trees impede the cour&s;e of the air, by which in &s;ome degree the putrid effluvia would be di&s;&s;ipated. In the wet &s;ea&s;on the inconvenience is equal, for then the&s;e re&s;ervoirs of corrupted water overflow their banks in the lower part of the town, e&s;pecially in the neighbourhood of the hotel, and fill the lower &s;tories of the hou&s;es, where they leave behind them an inconceivable quantity of &s;lime and filth: yet the&s;e canals are &s;ometimes cleaned; but the cleaning them is &s;o managed as to become as great a nui&s;ance as the foulne&s;s of the water; for the black mud that is taken from the bottom is &s;uffered to lie upon the banks, that is, in the middle of the &s;treet, till it has acquired a &s;ufficient degree of hardne&s;s to be made the lading of a boat, and carried away. As this mud con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of human ordure, which is regularly thrown into the canals every morning, there not being a nece&s;&s;ary-hou&s;e in the whole town, it poi&s;ons the air while it is drying to a con&s;iderable extent. Even the running &s;treams become nui&s;ances in their turn, by the na&s;tine&s;s or negligence of the people; for every now and then a dead
<PB N="726" REF="331">
hog,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1170. December.</NOTE> or a dead hor&s;e, is &s;tranded upon the &s;hallow parts, and it being the bu&s;ine&s;s of no particular per&s;on to remove the nui&s;ance, it is negligently left to time and accident. While we were here, a dead buffalo lay upon the &s;hoal of a river that ran through one of the principal &s;treets above a week, and at la&s;t was carried away by a flood.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are in general well adapted to the climate; they con&s;i&s;t of one very large room or hall on the ground floor, with a door at each end, both which generally &s;tand open: at one end a room is taken off by a partition, where the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e tran&s;acts his bu&s;ine&s;s; and in the middle between each end there is a court, which gives light to the hall, and at the &s;ame time increa&s;es the draught of air. From one corner of the hall the &s;tairs go up to the floor above, where al&s;o the rooms are &s;pacious and airy. In the alcove, which is formed by the court, the family dine; and at other times it is occupied by the female &s;laves, who are not allowed to &s;it down any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>The public buildings are, mo&s;t of them, old, heavy, and ungraceful; but the new church is not inelegant; it is built with a dome, that is &s;een from a great di&s;tance at &s;ea, and though the out&s;ide has rather a heavy appearance, the in&s;ide forms a very fine room: it is furni&s;hed with an organ of a proper &s;ize, being very large, and is mo&s;t magnificently il|luminated by chandeliers.</P>
<P>The town is inclo&s;ed by a &s;tone wall, of a moderate height; but the whole of it is old, and many parts are much out of repair. This wall it&s;elf is &s;urrounded by a river, which in &s;ome places is fifty, and in &s;ome a hundred yards wide: the &s;tream is rapid, but the water is &s;hallow. The wall is al&s;o lined within by a canal, which in different parts is of diffe|rent breadths; &s;o that, in pa&s;&s;ing either out or in through the
<PB N="727" REF="332">
gates, it is nece&s;&s;ary to cro&s;s two draw-bridges;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> and there is no acce&s;s for idle people or &s;trangers to walk upon the ramparts, which &s;eem to be but ill provided with guns.</P>
<P>In the north ea&s;t corner of the town &s;tands the ca&s;tle or citadel, the walls of which are both higher and thicker than tho&s;e of the town, e&s;pecially near the landing-place, where there is depth of water only for boats, which it completely commands, with &s;everal large guns that make a very good appearance.</P>
<P>Within this ca&s;tle are apartments for the Governor Gene|ral, and all the Council of India, to which they are enjoined to repair in ca&s;e of a &s;iege. Here are al&s;o large &s;torehou&s;es, where great quantities of the Company's goods are kept, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are brought from Europe, and where almo&s;t all their writers tran&s;act their bu&s;ine&s;s. In this place al&s;o are laid up a great number of cannon, whether to mount upon the walls or furni&s;h &s;hipping, we could not learn; and the Company is &s;aid to be well &s;upplied with powder, which is di&s;per&s;ed in various magazines, that if &s;ome &s;hould be de|&s;troyed by lightning, which in this place is very frequent, the re&s;t may e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the fortifications of the town, numerous forts are di&s;per&s;ed about the country to the di&s;tance of twenty or thirty miles; the&s;e &s;eem to have been intended merely to keep the natives in awe, and indeed they are fit for nothing el&s;e. For the &s;ame purpo&s;e a kind of hou&s;es, each of which mounts about eight guns, are placed in &s;uch &s;ituations as command the navigation of three or four canals, and con&s;equently the roads upon their banks: &s;ome of the&s;e are in the town it&s;elf, and it was from one of the&s;e that all the be&s;t hou&s;es belong|ing to the Chine&s;e were levelled with the ground in the Chi|ne&s;e rebellion of 1740. The&s;e defences are &s;cattered over all
<PB N="728" REF="333">
parts of Java,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> and the other i&s;lands of which the Dutch have got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the&s;e &s;eas. Of one of the&s;e &s;ingular forts, or fortified hou&s;es, we &s;hould have procured a drawing, if our Gentlemen had not been confined by &s;ickne&s;s almo&s;t all the time they were upon the i&s;land.</P>
<P>If the Dutch fortifications here are not formidable in them&s;elves, they become &s;o by their &s;ituation; for they are among mora&s;&s;es where the roads, which are nothing more than a bank thrown up between a canal and a ditch, may ea&s;ily be de&s;troyed, and con&s;equently the approach of heavy artillery either totally prevented or greatly retarded: for it would be exceedingly difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to tran&s;port them in boats, as they all mu&s;ter every night under the guns of the ca&s;tle, a &s;ituation from which it would be im|po&s;&s;ible for an enemy to take them. Be&s;ides, in this country, delay is death; &s;o that whatever retards an enemy, will de|&s;troy him. In le&s;s than a week, we were &s;en&s;ible of the un|healthine&s;s of the climate; and in le&s;s than a month half the &s;hip's company were unable to do their duty. We were told, that of a hundred &s;oldiers who arrive here from Europe, it was a rare thing for fifty to &s;urvive the fir&s;t year; that of tho&s;e fifty, half would then be in the ho&s;pital, and not ten of the re&s;t in perfect health: po&s;&s;ibly this account may be exaggerated; but the pale and feeble wretches whom we &s;aw crawling about with a mu&s;quet, which they were &s;carcely able to carry, inclined us to believe that it was true. Every white inhabitant of the town indeed is a &s;oldier; the younger are con&s;tantly mu&s;tered, and tho&s;e who have &s;erved five years are liable to be called out when their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance is thought to be nece&s;&s;ary; but as neither of them are ever exerci&s;ed, or do any kind of duty, much cannot be ex|pected from them. The Portugue&s;e, indeed, are in general
<PB N="729" REF="334">
good mark&s;men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> becau&s;e they employ them&s;elves much in &s;hooting wild hogs and deer: neither the Mardykers nor the Chine&s;e know the u&s;e of fire-arms; but as they are &s;aid to be brave, they might do much execution with their own weapons, &s;words, lances, and daggers. The Mardykers are Indians of all nations, who are de&s;cended from free ance&s;|tors, or have them&s;elves been made free.</P>
<P>But if it is difficult to attack Batavia by land, it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible to attack it by &s;ea: for the water is &s;o &s;hallow, that it will &s;carcely admit a longboat to come within cannon &s;hot of the walls, except in a narrow channel, called the river, that is walled on both &s;ides by &s;trong piers, and runs about half a mile into the harbour. At the other end, it ter|minates under the fire of the &s;tronge&s;t part of the ca&s;tle; and here its communication with the canals that inter&s;ect the town is cut off by a large wooden boom, which is &s;hut every night at &s;ix o'clock, and upon no pretence opened till the next morning. The harbour of Batavia is accounted the fine&s;t in India, and to all appearance with good rea&s;on; it is large enough to contain any number of &s;hips, and the ground is &s;o good that one anchor will hold till the cable decays: it never admits any &s;ea that is trouble&s;ome, and its only inconvenience is the &s;hoal water between the road and the river. When the &s;ea breeze blows fre&s;h, it makes a cock|ling &s;ea that is dangerous to boats: our longboat once &s;truck two or three times as &s;he was attempting to come out, and regained the river's mouth with &s;ome difficulty. A Dutch boat, laden with &s;ails and rigging for one of the Indiamen, was entirely lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Round the harbour, on the out&s;ide, lie many i&s;lands, which the Dutch have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and apply to different u&s;es. To one of them, called Edam, they tran&s;port all Eu|ropeans
<PB N="730" REF="335">
who have been guilty of crimes that are not worthy of death:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> &s;ome are &s;entenced to remain there ninety-nine years, &s;ome forty, &s;ome twenty, &s;ome le&s;s, down to five, in proportion to their offence; and during their bani&s;hment, they are employed as &s;laves in making ropes, and other drudgery. In another i&s;land, called Purmerent, they have an ho&s;pital, where people are &s;aid to recover much fa&s;ter than at Batavia. In a third, called Kuyper, they have warehou&s;es belonging to the Company, chiefly for rice, and other mer|chandize of &s;mall value; and here the foreign &s;hips, that are to be laid down at Ouru&s;t, another of the&s;e i&s;lands, which with Kuyper has been mentioned before, di&s;charge their cargoes at wharfs which are very convenient for the pur|po&s;e. Here the guns, &s;ails, and other &s;tores of the Falmouth, a man of war, which was condemned at this place when &s;he was returning from Manilla, were depo&s;ited, and the &s;hip her&s;elf remained in the harbour with only the warrant offi|cers on board for many years. Remittances were regularly made them from home; but no notice was ever taken of the many memorials they &s;ent, de&s;iring to be recalled. Happily for them, the Dutch thought fit, about &s;ix months before our arrival, to &s;ell the ve&s;&s;el and all her &s;tores, by public auction, and &s;end the officers home in their own &s;hips. At Ouru&s;t, they repair all their own &s;hipping, and keep a large quan|tity of naval &s;tores.</P>
<P>The country round Batavia is for &s;ome miles a continued range of country hou&s;es and gardens. Many of the gardens are very large, and, by &s;ome &s;trange fatality, all are planted with trees almo&s;t as thick as they can &s;tand; &s;o that the country derives no advantage from its being cleared of the wood that originally covered it, except the fruit of that which has been planted in its room. The&s;e impenetrable
<PB N="731" REF="336">
fore&s;ts &s;tand in a dead flat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> which extends &s;ome miles beyond them, and is inter&s;ected in many directions by rivers, and more &s;till by canals, which are navigable for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. Nor is this the wor&s;t, for the fence of every field and garden is a ditch; and inter&s;per&s;ed among the cultivated ground there are many filthy fens, bogs, and mora&s;&s;es, as well fre&s;h as &s;alt.</P>
<P>It is not &s;trange that the inhabitants of &s;uch a country &s;hould be familiar with di&s;ea&s;e and death: preventive medi|cines are taken almo&s;t as regularly as food; and every body expects the returns of &s;ickne&s;s, as we do the &s;ea&s;ons of the year. We did not &s;ee a &s;ingle face in Batavia that indicated perfect health, for there is not the lea&s;t tint of colour in the cheeks either of man or woman: the women indeed are mo&s;t delicately fair; but with the appearance of di&s;ea&s;e there never can be perfect beauty. People talk of death with as much indifference as they do in a camp; and when an acquaintance is &s;aid to be dead, the common reply is, "Well, he owed me nothing;" or, <Q>I mu&s;t get my money of his executors.</Q></P>
<P>To this de&s;cription of the environs of Batavia there are but two exceptions. The Governor's country hou&s;e is &s;ituated upon a ri&s;ing ground; but its a&s;cent is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that it is known to be above the common level only by the ca|nals being left behind, and the appearance of a few bad hedges: his Excellency, however, who is a native of this place, has, with &s;ome trouble and expence, contrived to in|clo&s;e his own garden with a ditch; &s;uch is the influence of habit both upon the ta&s;te and the under&s;tanding. A famous market al&s;o, called Pa&s;&s;ar Tanabank, is held upon an emi|nence that ri&s;es perpendicularly about thirty feet above the plain; and except the&s;e &s;ituations, the ground, for an extent
<PB N="732" REF="337">
of between thirty and forty miles round Batavia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> is exactly parallel to the horizon. At the di&s;tance of about forty miles inland there are hills of a con&s;iderable height, where, as we were informed, the air is healthy, and comparatively cool. Here the vegetables of Europe flouri&s;h in great perfection, particularly &s;trawberries, which can but ill bear heat; and the inhabitants are vigorous and ruddy. Upon the&s;e hills &s;ome of the principal people have country hou&s;es, which they vi&s;it once a-year; and one was begun for the Governor, upon the plan of Blenheim, the famous &s;eat of the Duke of Marlborough in Oxford&s;hire, but it has never been fini&s;hed. To the&s;e hills al&s;o people are &s;ent by the phy&s;icians, for the recovery of their health, and the effects of the air are &s;aid to be almo&s;t miraculous: the patient grows well in a &s;hort time, but con&s;tantly relap&s;es &s;oon after his return to Batavia.</P>
<P>But the &s;ame &s;ituation and circum&s;tances which render Batavia and the country round it unwhole&s;ome, render it the be&s;t gardener's ground in the world. The &s;oil is fruitful be|yond imagination, and the conveniences and luxuries of life that it produces are almo&s;t without number.</P>
<P>Rice, which is well known to be the corn of the&s;e coun|tries, and to &s;erve the inhabitants in&s;tead of bread, grows in great plenty: and I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that in the hilly parts of Java, and in many of the ea&s;tern i&s;lands, a &s;pecies of this grain is planted, which in the we&s;tern parts of India is intirely unknown. It is called by the natives <HI>Paddy Gunning,</HI> or Moun|tain rice; this, contrary to the other &s;ort which mu&s;t be un|der water three parts in four of the time of its growth, is planted upon the &s;ides of hills where no water but rain can come: it is however planted at the beginning of the rainy &s;ea|&s;on, and reaped in the beginning of the dry. How far this kind of rice might be u&s;eful in our We&s;t Indian i&s;lands, where no
<PB N="733" REF="338">
bread corn is grown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> it may perhaps be worth while to en|quire.</P>
<P>Indian corn, or maize, is al&s;o produced here; which the inhabitants gather when young, and toa&s;t in the ear. Here is al&s;o a great variety of kidney beans, and lentiles, which they call <HI>Cadjang,</HI> and which make a con&s;iderable part of the food of the common people; be&s;ides millet, yams both wet and dry, &s;weet potatoes, and European potatoes, which are very good, but not cultivated in great plenty. In the gar|dens, there are cabbages, lettuces, cucumbers, rhadi&s;hes, the white rhadi&s;hes of China, which boil almo&s;t as well as a turnep; carrots, par&s;ley, celery, pigeon peas, the egg plant, which broiled, and eaten with pepper and &s;alt, is very deli|cious; a kind of greens re&s;embling &s;pinage; onions, very &s;mall, but excellent; and a&s;paragus: be&s;ides &s;ome European plants of a &s;trong &s;mell, particularly &s;age, hy&s;op, and rue. Sugar is al&s;o produced here in immen&s;e quantities: very great crops of the fine&s;t and large&s;t canes that can be ima|gined are produced with very little care, and yield a much larger proportion of &s;ugar than the canes of the We&s;t Indies. White &s;ugar is &s;old here at two pence half-penny a pound; and the mola&s;&s;es makes the arrack, of which, as of rum, it is the chief ingredient; a &s;mall quantity of rice, and &s;ome cocoa-nut wine, being added, chiefly, I &s;uppo&s;e, to give it flavour. A &s;mall quantity of indigo is al&s;o produced here, not as an article of trade, but merely for home con&s;umption.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t abundant article of vegetable luxury here, is the fruit; of which there is no le&s;s than &s;ix and thirty dif|ferent kinds, and I &s;hall give a very brief account of each.</P>
<P N="1">1. The pine apple; <HI>Bromelin Ananas.</HI> This fruit, which is here called <HI>Nanas,</HI> grows very large, and in &s;uch plenty that they may &s;ometimes be bought at the fir&s;t hand for a far|thing
<PB N="734" REF="339">
a piece;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> and at the common fruit &s;hops we got three of them for two pence half-penny. They are very juicy and well flavoured; but we all agreed that we had eaten as good from a hot-hou&s;e in England: they are however &s;o luxuriant in their growth that mo&s;t of them have two or three crowns, and a great number of &s;uckers from the bottom of the fruit; of the&s;e Mr. Banks once counted nine, and they are &s;o for|ward that very often while they &s;till adhered to the parent plant they &s;hot out their fruit, which, by the time the large one became ripe, were of no incon&s;iderable &s;ize. We &s;everal times &s;aw three upon one apple, and were told that a plant once produced a clu&s;ter of nine, be&s;ides the principal: this indeed was con&s;idered as &s;o great a curio&s;ity, that it was pre|&s;erved in &s;ugar, and &s;ent to the Prince of Orange.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sweet oranges. The&s;e are very good, but while we were here, &s;old for &s;ix pence a piece.</P>
<P N="3">3. Pumplemoe&s;es, which in the We&s;t Indies are called Shaddocks. The&s;e were well flavoured, but not juicy; their want of juice however was an accidental effect of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P N="4">4. Lemons. The&s;e were very &s;carce; but the want of them was amply compen&s;ated by the plenty of limes.</P>
<P N="5">5. Limes. The&s;e were excellent, and to be bought at about twelve pence a hundred. We &s;aw only two or three Seville oranges, which were almo&s;t all rind; and there are many &s;orts, both of oranges and lemons, which I &s;hall not particu|larly mention, becau&s;e they are neither e&s;teemed by Euro|peans nor the natives them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="6">6. Mangos. This fruit during our &s;tay was &s;o infe&s;ted with maggots, which bred in the in&s;ide them, that &s;carcely one in three was eatable; and the be&s;t of them were much inferior to tho&s;e of Brazil; they are generally compared by
<PB N="735" REF="340">
Europeans to a melting peach, which, indeed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> they re&s;emble in &s;oftne&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s, but certainly fall much &s;hort in flavour. The climate here, we were told, is too hot and damp for them; but there are as many &s;orts of them as there are of apples in England, and &s;ome are much &s;uperior to others. One &s;ort, which is called <HI>Mangha Cowani,</HI> has &s;o &s;trong a &s;mell that a European can &s;carcely bear one in the room; the&s;e, however, the natives are fond of. The three &s;orts which are generally preferred, are the <HI>Mangha Doodool,</HI> the <HI>Mangha Santock,</HI> and the <HI>Mangha Gure.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Bananes. Of the&s;e al&s;o there are innumerable &s;orts, but three only are good; the <HI>Pi&s;&s;ang Mas,</HI> the <HI>Pi&s;&s;ang Radja,</HI> and the <HI>Pi&s;&s;ang Ambou:</HI> all the&s;e have a plea&s;ant vinous ta&s;te, and the re&s;t are u&s;eful in different ways; &s;ome are fried in batter, and others are boiled and eaten as bread. There is one which de&s;erves the particular notice of the botani&s;t, be|cau&s;e, contrary to the nature of its tribe, it is full of &s;eeds, and is therefore called <HI>Pi&s;&s;ang Batu,</HI> or <HI>Pi&s;&s;ang Bidjie</HI>; it has however no excellence to recommend it to the ta&s;te, but the Malays u&s;e it as a remedy for the flux.</P>
<P N="8">8. Grapes. The&s;e are not in great perfection, but they are very dear; for we could not buy a moderate bunch for le&s;s than a &s;hilling or eighteen pence.</P>
<P N="9">9. Tamarinds. The&s;e are in great plenty, and very cheap: the people however do not put them up in the manner prac|ti&s;ed by the We&s;t Indians, but cure them with &s;alt, by which means they become a black ma&s;s, &s;o di&s;agreeable to the &s;ight and ta&s;te, that few Europeans chu&s;e to meddle with them.</P>
<P N="10">10. Water melons. The&s;e are in great plenty, and very good.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="736" REF="341"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE>11. Pumpkins. The&s;e are beyond compari&s;on the mo&s;t u&s;eful fruit that can be carried to &s;ea; for they will keep without any care &s;everal months, and with &s;ugar and lemon-juice, make a pye that can &s;carcely be di&s;tingui&s;hed from one made of the be&s;t apples; and with pepper and &s;alt, they are a &s;ub&s;titute for turneps, not to be de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="12">12. Papaws. This fruit when it is ripe is full of &s;eeds, and almo&s;t without flavour; but if when it is green it is pared, and the core taken out, it is better than the be&s;t turnep.</P>
<P N="13">13. Guava. This fruit is much commended by the inha|bitants of our i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies, who probably have a better &s;ort than we met with here, where the &s;mell of them was &s;o di&s;agreeably &s;trong that it made &s;ome of us &s;ick; tho&s;e who ta&s;ted them, &s;aid, that the flavour was equally rank.</P>
<P N="14">14. Sweet &s;op. The <HI>Annona &s;quammo&s;a</HI> of Linnaeus. This is al&s;o a We&s;t Indian fruit; it con&s;i&s;ts only of a ma&s;s of large kernels, from which a &s;mall proportion of pulp may be &s;ucked, which is very &s;weet, but has little flavour.</P>
<P N="15">15. Cu&s;tard apple. The <HI>Annona reticulata</HI> of Linnaeus. The quality of this fruit is well expre&s;&s;ed by its Engli&s;h name, which it acquired in the We&s;t Indies; for it is as like a cu&s;|tard, and a good one too, as can be imagined.</P>
<P N="16">16. The ca&s;hew apple. This is &s;eldom eaten on account of its a&s;tringency. The nut that grows upon the top of it is well known in Europe.</P>
<P N="17">17. The cocoa-nut. This is al&s;o well known in Europe; there are &s;everal &s;orts, but the be&s;t of tho&s;e we found here is called <HI>Calappi Edjou,</HI> and is ea&s;ily known by the redne&s;s of the fle&s;h between the &s;kin and the &s;hell.</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="737" REF="342">18. Mango&s;tan. The <HI>Garcinia Mango&s;tana</HI> of Linnaeus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> This fruit, which is peculiar to the Ea&s;t Indies, is about the &s;ize of the crab apple, and of a deep red-wine colour: on the top of it is the figure of five or &s;ix &s;mall triangles joined in a circle, and at the bottom &s;everal hollow green leaves, which are re|mains of the blo&s;&s;om. When they are to be eaten, the &s;kin, or rather fle&s;h, mu&s;t be taken off, under which are found &s;ix or &s;even white kernels, placed in a circular order, and the pulp with which the&s;e are inveloped, is the fruit, than which nothing can be more delicious: it is a happy mixture of the tart and the &s;weet, which is no le&s;s whole&s;ome than plea|&s;ant; and with the &s;weet orange, this fruit is allowed in any quantity to tho&s;e who are afflicted with fevers, either of the putrid or inflammatory kind.</P>
<P N="19">19. The jamboo. The <HI>Eugenia Mallaccen&s;is</HI> of Linnaeus. This fruit is of a deep red colour, and an oval &s;hape; the large&s;t, which are always the be&s;t, are not bigger than a &s;mall apple; they are plea&s;ant and cooling, though they have not much flavour.</P>
<P N="20">20. The jambu-eyer. A &s;pecies of the <HI>Eugenia</HI> of Linnaeus. Of this fruit there are two &s;orts of a &s;imilar &s;hape, re&s;em|bling a bell, but differing in colour; one being red, the other white. They &s;omewhat exceed a large cherry in &s;ize, and in ta&s;te have neither flavour nor even &s;weetne&s;s, con|taining nothing but a watry juice, &s;lightly acidulated; yet their coolne&s;s recommends them in this hot country.</P>
<P N="21">21. Jambu-eyer mauwar. The <HI>Eugenia jambos</HI> of Linnaeus. This is more grateful to the &s;mell than the ta&s;te; in ta&s;te it re&s;embles the con&s;erve of ro&s;es, and in &s;mell the fre&s;h &s;cent of tho&s;e flowers.</P>
<P N="22">22. The pomgranate. This is the &s;ame fruit that is known by the &s;ame name all over Europe.</P>
<P N="23"><PB N="738" REF="343"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE>23. Durion. A fruit that in &s;hape re&s;embles a &s;mall melon, but the &s;kin is covered with &s;harp conical &s;pines, whence its name; for <HI>dure,</HI> in the Malay language, &s;ignifies prickle. When it is ripe, it divides longitudinally into &s;even or eight compartments, each of which contains &s;ix or &s;even nuts, not quite &s;o large as che&s;nuts, which are covered with a &s;ub|&s;tance that in colour and con&s;i&s;tence very much re&s;embles thick cream: this is the part that is eaten, and the natives are fond of it to exce&s;s. To Europeans it is generally di&s;a|greeable at fir&s;t; for in ta&s;te, it &s;omewhat re&s;embles a mix|ture of cream, &s;ugar, and onions; and in the &s;mell, the onions predominate.</P>
<P N="24">24. Nanca. This fruit, which in &s;ome parts of India is called Jack, has, like the Durion, a &s;mell very di&s;agreeable to &s;tran|gers, and &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of mellow apples mixed with garlic: the flavour is not more adapted to the general ta&s;te. In &s;ome countries that are favourable to it, it is &s;aid to grow to an immen&s;e &s;ize. Rumphius relates, that it is &s;ometimes &s;o large that a man cannot ea&s;ily lift it; and we were told by a Malay, that at Madura it is &s;ometimes &s;o large as not to be carried but by the united efforts of two men. At Batavia, however, they never exceed the &s;ize of a large melon, which in &s;hape they very much re&s;emble: they are covered with angular prickles, like the &s;hootings of &s;ome chry&s;tals, which however are not hard enough to wound tho&s;e who handle them.</P>
<P N="25">25. Champada. This differs from the Nanca in little ex|cept &s;ize, it not being &s;o big.</P>
<P N="26">26. Rambutan. This is a fruit little known to Europeans; in appearance it very much re&s;embles a che&s;nut with the hu&s;k on, and like that, is covered with &s;mall points, which are &s;oft and of a deep red colour: under this &s;kin is the
<PB N="739" REF="344">
fruit, and within the fruit a &s;tone;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> the eatable part there|fore is &s;mall in quantity, but its acid is perhaps more agree|able than any other in the whole vegetable kingdom.</P>
<P N="27">27. Jambolan. This in &s;ize and appearance is not unlike a dama&s;cene; but in ta&s;te is &s;till more a&s;tringent, and there|fore le&s;s agreeable.</P>
<P N="28">28. The Boa Bidarra; or <HI>Rhamnus Jujuba</HI> of Linnaeus. This is a round yellow fruit, about the &s;ize of a goo&s;eberry; its flavour is like that of an apple, but it has the a&s;tringency of a crab.</P>
<P N="29">29. Nam nam. The <HI>Cynometra Cauliflora</HI> of Linnaeus. This fruit in &s;hape &s;omewhat re&s;embles a kidney; it is about three inches long, and the out&s;ide is very rough: it is &s;el|dom eaten raw, but fried with batter it makes a good fritter.</P>
<P N="30,31">30, 31. The Catappa, or <HI>Terminalia Catappa</HI>; and the Canare, the <HI>Canarium commune</HI> of Linnaeus; are both nuts, with kernels &s;omewhat re&s;embling an almond; but the difficulty of breaking the &s;hell is &s;o great, that they are no where pub|licly &s;old. Tho&s;e which we ta&s;ted were gathered for curio|&s;ity by Mr. Banks, from the tree upon which they grew.</P>
<P N="32">32. The Madja; or <HI>Limonia</HI> of Linnaeus; contains, under a hard brittle &s;hell, a lightly acid pulp, which cannot be eaten without &s;ugar; and with it, is not generally thought plea|&s;ant.</P>
<P N="33">33. Suntul. The <HI>Trichilia</HI> of Linnaeus. This is the wor&s;t of all the fruits that I &s;hall particularly mention: in &s;ize and &s;hape it re&s;embles the Madja; and within a thick &s;kin con|tains kernels like tho&s;e of the Mango&s;tan, the ta&s;te of which is both acid and a&s;tringent, and &s;o di&s;agreeable that we were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee it expo&s;ed upon the fruit-&s;talls.</P>
<P N="34,35,36"><PB N="740" REF="345"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE>34, 35, 36. The Blimbing, or <HI>Averrhoa Belimbi</HI>; the Blim|bing Be&s;&s;e, or <HI>Averrhoa Carambola</HI>; and the Cherrema, or <HI>Averrhoa acida</HI> of Linnaeus, are three &s;pecies of one genus; and though they differ in &s;hape, are nearly of the &s;ame ta&s;te. The Blimbing Be&s;&s;e is the &s;weete&s;t: the other two are &s;o au&s;terely acid, that they cannot be u&s;ed without dre&s;&s;ing; they make however excellent pickles and &s;our &s;auce.</P>
<P N="37">37. The Salack; or <HI>Calamus Rotang Zalacca</HI> of Linnaeus. This is the fruit of a prickly bu&s;h; it is about as big as a walnut, and covered with &s;cales, like tho&s;e of a lizard: below the &s;cales are two or three yellow kernels, in flavour &s;omewhat re&s;embling a &s;trawberry.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, the i&s;land of Java, and particularly the coun|try round Batavia, produces many kinds of fruit which were not in &s;ea&s;on during our &s;tay; we were al&s;o told that apples, &s;trawberries, and many other fruits from Europe, had been planted up in the mountains, and flouri&s;hed there in great luxuriance. We &s;aw &s;everal fruits pre&s;erved in &s;ugar, that we did not &s;ee recent from the tree, one of which is called <HI>Kimkit,</HI> and another <HI>Boa Atap:</HI> and here are &s;everal others which are eaten only by the natives, particularly the <HI>Kellor,</HI> the <HI>Guilindina,</HI> the <HI>Moringa,</HI> and the <HI>Soccum.</HI> The Soccum is of the &s;ame kind with the bread-fruit in the South Sea i&s;lands, but &s;o much inferior, that if it had not been for the &s;imili|tude in the outward appearance both of the fruit and the tree, we &s;hould not have referred it to that cla&s;s. The&s;e and &s;ome others do not merit to be particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>The quantity of fruit that is con&s;umed at Batavia is incre|dible; but that which is publicly expo&s;ed to &s;ale is generally over-ripe. A &s;tranger however may get good fruit in a &s;treet called Pa&s;&s;ar Pi&s;&s;ang, which lies north from the great church,
<PB N="741" REF="346">
and very near it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> This &s;treet is inhabited by none but Chine&s;e fruit-&s;ellers, who are &s;upplied from the gardens of Gentle|men in the neighbourhood of the town, with &s;uch as is fre&s;h, and excellent in its kind, for which however they mu&s;t be paid more than four times the market price.</P>
<P>The town in general is &s;upplied from a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance, where great quantities of land are cultivated merely for the production of fruit. The country people, to whom the&s;e lands belong, meet the people of the town at two great markets; one on Monday, called Pa&s;&s;ar Sineen; and the other on Saturday, called Pa&s;&s;ar Tanabank. The&s;e fairs are held at places con&s;iderably di&s;tant from each other, for the convenience of different di&s;tricts; neither of them how|ever are more than five miles di&s;tant from Batavia. At the&s;e fairs, the be&s;t fruit may be bought at the cheape&s;t rate; and the &s;ight of them to a European is very entertaining. The quantity of fruit is a&s;toni&s;hing; forty or fifty cart loads of the fine&s;t pine apples, packed as carele&s;sly as turneps in England, are common, and other fruit in the &s;ame profu|&s;ion. The days however on which the&s;e markets are held are ill contrived; the time between Saturday and Monday is too &s;hort, and that between Monday and Saturday too long: great part of what is bought on Monday is always much the wor&s;e for keeping before a new &s;tock can be bought, either by the retailer or con&s;umer; &s;o that for &s;eve|ral days in every week there is no good fruit in the hands of any people but the Chine&s;e in Pa&s;&s;ar Pi&s;&s;ang.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this part of India practi&s;e a luxury which &s;eems to be but little attended to in other countries; they are continually burning aromatic woods and re&s;ins, and &s;catter odours round them in a profu&s;ion of flowers, po&s;&s;ibly as an antidote to the noi&s;ome effluvia of their ditches
<PB N="742" REF="347">
and canals.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> Of &s;weet &s;melling flowers they have a great va|riety, altogether unknown in Europe, the chief of which I &s;hall briefly de&s;cribe.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Champacka,</HI> or <HI>Michelia Champacca.</HI> This grows upon a tree as large as an apple tree, and con&s;i&s;ts of fifteen long narrow petala, which give it the appearance of being double, though in reality it is not &s;o: its colour is yellow, and much deeper than that of a jonquil, to which it has &s;ome re&s;em|blance in &s;mell.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Cananga,</HI> or <HI>Uvaria Cananga,</HI> is a green flower, not at all re&s;embling the blo&s;&s;om of any tree or plant in Europe: it has indeed more the appearance of a bunch of leaves than a flower; its &s;cent is agreeable, but altogether peculiar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Mulatti,</HI> or <HI>Nyctanthes Sambac.</HI> This is well known in Engli&s;h hot-hou&s;es by the name of Arabian je&s;&s;amine: it grows here in the greate&s;t profu&s;ion, and its fragrance, like that of all other Indian flowers, though exqui&s;itely plea&s;ing, has not that over-powering &s;trength which di&s;tingui&s;hes &s;ome of the &s;ame &s;orts in Europe.</P>
<P N="4,5">4, 5. The <HI>Combang Caracna&s;&s;i,</HI> and <HI>Combang Tonquin, Percularia Glabro.</HI> The&s;e are &s;mall flowers, of the dog's-bane kind, very much re&s;embling each other in &s;hape and &s;mell, highly fragrant, but very different from every product of an Engli&s;h garden.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>Bonga Tanjong,</HI> or <HI>Mimu&s;ops Elengi</HI> of Linnaeus. This flower is &s;haped like a &s;tar of &s;even or eight rays, and is about half an inch in diameter; it is of a yellowi&s;h colour, and has an agreeable &s;mell.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is the <HI>Sundal Malam,</HI> or <HI>Polianthes Tube|ro&s;a.</HI> This flower, being the &s;ame with our own tubero&s;e, can
<PB N="743" REF="348">
have no place among tho&s;e that are unknown in Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> but I mention it for its Malay name, which &s;ignifies "In|triguer of the Night," and is not inelegantly conceived. The heat of this climate is &s;o great, that few flowers exhale their &s;weets in the day; and this in particular, from its total want of &s;cent at that time, and the mode&s;ty of its colour, which is white, &s;eems negligent of attracting admirers, but as &s;oon as night comes on, it diffu&s;es its fragrance, and at once compels the attention, and excites the complacency of all who approach it.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all &s;old about the &s;treets every evening at &s;un&s;et, either &s;trung upon a thread, in wreaths of about two feet long, or made up into no&s;egays of different forms, either of which may be purcha&s;ed for about a halfpenny. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are, in private gardens many other &s;weet flowers, which are not produced in a &s;ufficient quantity to be brought to market. With a mixture of the&s;e flowers, and the leaves of a plant called <HI>pandang,</HI> cut into &s;mall pieces, per&s;ons of both &s;exes fill their hair and their clothes, and with the &s;ame mixture indulge a much higher luxury by &s;trewing it on their beds, &s;o that the chamber in which they &s;leep, breathes the riche&s;t and pure&s;t of all odours, unallayed by the fumes which cannot but ari&s;e where the &s;leeper lies under two or three blankets and a quilt, for the bed covering here is nothing more than a &s;ingle piece of fine chintz.</P>
<P>Before I clo&s;e my account of the vegetable productions of this part of India, I mu&s;t take &s;ome notice of the &s;pices Java originally produced none but pepper. This is now &s;ent from hence into Europe to a great value, but the quan|tity con&s;umed here is very &s;mall: the inhabitants u&s;e <HI>Cap|&s;icum,</HI> or, as it is called in Europe, Cayan pepper, almo&s;t univer&s;ally in its &s;tead. Cloves and nutmegs, having been
<PB N="744" REF="349">
monopolized by the Dutch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> are become too dear to be plentifully u&s;ed by the other inhabitants of this country, who are very fond of them. Cloves, although they are &s;aid ori|ginally to have been the produce of Machian, or Bachian, a &s;mall i&s;land far to the ea&s;tward, and only fifteen miles to the northward of the line, and to have been from thence di&s;|&s;eminated by the Dutch, at their fir&s;t coming into the&s;e parts, over all the ea&s;tern i&s;lands, are now confined to Amboina, and the &s;mall i&s;les that lie in its neighbourhood; the Dutch having, by different treaties of peace between them and the conquered kings of all the other i&s;lands, &s;tipulated, that they &s;hould have only a certain number of trees in their domini|ons, and in future quarrels, as a puni&s;hment for di&s;obedi|ence and rebellion, le&s;&s;ened the quantity, till at la&s;t they left them no claim to any. Nutmegs have in a manner been extirpated in all the i&s;lands except their fir&s;t native &s;oil, Banda, which ea&s;ily &s;upplies every nation upon earth, and would as ea&s;ily &s;upply every nation in another globe of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions, if there was any &s;uch to which the in|du&s;trious Hollander could tran&s;port the commodity; it is, however, certain, that there are a few trees of this &s;pice upon the coa&s;t of New Guinea. There may perhaps be both cloves and nutmegs upon other i&s;lands to the ea&s;tward; for tho&s;e, neither the Dutch, nor any other European, &s;eem to think it worth while to examine.</P>
<P>The principal tame quadrupeds of this country are hor&s;es, cattle, buffalos, &s;heep, goats, and hogs. The hor&s;es are &s;mall, never exceeding in &s;ize what we call a &s;tout galloway, but they are nimble and &s;pirited, and are reported to have been found here when the Europeans fir&s;t came round the Cape of Good Hope. The horned cattle are &s;aid to be the &s;ame &s;pecies as tho&s;e in Europe, but they differ &s;o much in appearance, that we were inclined to doubt it: they have in|deed
<PB N="745" REF="350">
the <HI>palearia</HI> or <HI>dewlap,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> which naturali&s;ts make the di&s;|tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of the European &s;pecies, but they certainly are found wild, not only in Java but &s;everal of the ea&s;tern i&s;lands. The &s;le&s;h of tho&s;e that we eat at Batavia, had a finer grain than European beef, but it was le&s;s juicy, and mi&s;erably lean. Buffalos are plenty, but the Dutch never eat them, nor will they drink their milk, being pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a notion that both are unwhole&s;ome, and tend to produce fevers; though the natives and Chine&s;e eat both, without any injury to their health. The &s;heep are of the kind which have long ears that hang down, and hair in|&s;tead of wool: the fle&s;h of the&s;e is hard and tough, and in every re&s;pect the wor&s;t mutton we ever &s;aw: we found here, however, a few Cape &s;heep, which are excellent, but &s;o dear that we gave five and forty &s;hillings a-piece for four of them, the heavie&s;t of which weighed only five and forty pounds. The goats are not better than the &s;heep, but the hogs, e&s;pecially the Chine&s;e breed, are incomparable, and &s;o fat, that the purcha&s;er agrees for the lean &s;eparately. The butcher, who is always a Chine&s;e, without the lea&s;t &s;cruple cuts off as much of the fat as he is de&s;ired, and after|wards &s;ells it to his countrymen, who melt it down, and eat it in&s;tead of butter with their rice: but notwith&s;tanding the excellence of this pork, the Dutch are &s;o &s;trongly prejudiced in favour of every thing that comes from their native coun|try, that they eat only of the Dutch breed, which are here &s;old as much dearer than the Chine&s;e, as the Chine&s;e are &s;old dearer than the Dutch in Europe.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e animals, which are tame, they have dogs and cats, and there are among the di&s;tant mountains &s;ome wild hor&s;es and cattle: buffalos are not found wild in any part of Java, though they abound in Maca&s;&s;ar, and &s;everal other ea&s;tern i&s;lands. The neighbourhood of Batavia, how|ever,
<PB N="746" REF="351">
is plentifully &s;upplied with two kinds of deer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> and wild hogs, which are &s;old at a rea&s;onable price by the Por|tugue&s;e, who &s;hoot them, and are very good food.</P>
<P>Among the mountains, and in the de&s;art parts of the i&s;land, there are tygers, it is &s;aid, in great abundance, and &s;ome rhinocero&s;es; in the&s;e parts al&s;o there are monkies, and there are a few of them even in the neighbourhood of Batavia.</P>
<P>Of fi&s;h, here is an amazing plenty; many &s;orts are excel|lent, and all are very cheap, except the few that are &s;carce. It happens here, as in other places, that vanity gets the better even of appetite: the cheap fi&s;h, mo&s;t of which is of the be&s;t kind, is the food only of &s;laves, and that which is dear, only becau&s;e it is &s;carce, and very much inferior in every re&s;pect, is placed upon the tables of the rich. A &s;en|&s;ible hou&s;ekeeper once &s;poke to us freely upon the &s;ubject. I know, &s;aid he, as well as you, that I could purcha&s;e a better di&s;h of fi&s;h for a &s;hilling, than what now co&s;ts me ten; but if I &s;hould make &s;o good a u&s;e of my money, I &s;hould here be as much de&s;pi&s;ed, as you would be in Europe, if you were to cover your table with offals, fit only for beggars or dogs.</P>
<P>Turtle is al&s;o found here, but it is neither &s;o &s;weet nor &s;o fat as the We&s;t Indian turtle, even in London; &s;uch as it is, however, we &s;hould con&s;ider it as a dainty; but the Dutch, among other &s;ingularities, do not eat it. We &s;aw &s;ome li|zards, or Iguanas, here of a very large &s;ize; we were told that &s;ome were as thick as a man's thigh, and Mr. Banks &s;hot one that was five feet long: the fle&s;h of this animal proved to be very good food.</P>
<P>Poultry is very good here, and in great plenty: fowls of a very large &s;ize, ducks, and gee&s;e are very cheap; pigeons
<PB N="747" REF="352">
are dear, and the price of turkies extravagant.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> We &s;ome|times found the fle&s;h of the&s;e animals lean and dry, but this was merely the effect of their being ill fed, for tho&s;e that we fed our&s;elves were as good as any of the &s;ame kind that we had ta&s;ted in Europe, and we &s;ometimes thought them even better.</P>
<P>Wild fowl in general is &s;carce. We once &s;aw a wild duck in the fields, but never any that were to be &s;old. We fre|quently &s;aw &s;nipes of two kinds, one of them exactly the &s;ame as that in Europe, and a kind of thru&s;h was always to be had in great plenty of the Portugue&s;e, who, for I know not what rea&s;on, &s;eem to have monopolized the wild fowl and game. Of &s;nipes, it is remarkable that they are found in more parts of the world than any other bird, being com|mon almo&s;t all over Europe, A&s;ia, Africa, and America.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to drink, Nature has not been quite &s;o liberal to the inhabitants of Java as to &s;ome whom &s;he has placed in the le&s;s fruitful regions of the north. The native Javane&s;e, and mo&s;t of the other Indians who inhabit this i&s;land, are indeed Mahometans, and therefore have no rea&s;on to regret the want of wine; but, as if the prohibition of their law re&s;pected only the manner of becoming drunk, and not drunkenne&s;s it&s;elf, they chew opium, to the total &s;ubver&s;ion not only of their under&s;tanding but their health.</P>
<P>The arrack that is made here, is too well known to need a de&s;cription: be&s;ides which, the palm yields a wine of the &s;ame kind with that which has already been de&s;cribed in the account of the i&s;land of Savu; it is procured from the &s;ame tree, in the &s;ame manner, and is &s;old in three &s;tates. The fir&s;t, in which it is called <HI>Tuac mani&s;e,</HI> differs little from that in which it comes from the tree; yet even this has received

In the other two &s;tates it has undergone a fermentation, and received an infu&s;ion of cer|tain herbs and roots, by which it lo&s;es its &s;weetne&s;s, and ac|quires a ta&s;te very au&s;tere and di&s;agreeable. In one of the&s;e &s;tates it is called <HI>Tuac cras,</HI> and in the other <HI>Tuac cuning,</HI> but the &s;pecific difference I do not know; in both, however, it intoxicates very powerfully. A liquor called Tuac is al&s;o made from the cocoa-nut tree, but this is u&s;ed chiefly to put into the arrack, for in that which is good it is an e&s;&s;ential in|gredient.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Some Account of the Inhabitants of Batavia, and the ad|jacent Country, their Manners, Cu&s;toms, and Manner of Life.</HEAD>
<P>THE town of Batavia, although,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> as I have already ob|&s;erved, it is the capital of die Dutch dominions in India, is &s;o far from being peopled with Dutchmen, that not one fifth part, even of the European inhabitants of the town, and its environs, are natives of Holland, or of Dutch extraction: the greater part are Portugue&s;e, and be&s;ides Europeans, there are Indians of various nations, and Chine&s;e, be&s;ides a great number of negro &s;laves. In the troops, there are natives of almo&s;t every country in Europe, but the Germans are more than all the re&s;t put together; there are &s;ome Engli&s;h and French, but the Dutch, though other Europeans are per|mitted to get money here, keep all the power in their own hands, and con&s;equently po&s;&s;e&s;s all public employments. No man, of whatever nation, can come hither to &s;ettle, in any other character than that of a &s;oldier in the Company's &s;er|vice, in which, before they are accepted, they mu&s;t covenant to remain five years. As &s;oon however as this form has been complied with, they are allowed, upon application to the council, to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from their corps, and enter immediately into any branch of trade, which their money or credit will enable them to carry on; and by this means it is that all the white inhabitants of the place are &s;oldiers.</P>

<P>The Indians, who are mixed with the Dutch and Portu|gue&s;e in the town of Batavia, and the country adjacent, are not, as might be &s;uppo&s;ed, Javane&s;e, the original natives of the i&s;land, but natives of the various i&s;lands from which the Dutch import &s;laves, and are either &s;uch as have them&s;elves been manumized, or the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e who formerly received manumi&s;&s;ion; and they are all comprehended under the general name of <HI>Oran&s;lam,</HI> or <HI>I&s;alam,</HI> &s;ignifying Be|lievers of the true Faith.

<P>The&s;e are the people among whom the practice that is called <HI>a mock,</HI> or running a muck, has prevailed for time im|memorial. It is well known, that to run a muck in the original &s;en&s;e of the word, is to get intoxicated with opium, and then ru&s;h into the &s;treet with a drawn weapon, and kill whoever comes in the way, till the party is him&s;elf either killed or taken pri&s;oner; of this &s;everal in&s;tances happened while we were at Batavia, and one of the officers, who&s;e bu|&s;ine&s;s it is, among other things, to apprehend &s;uch people, told us, that there was &s;carcely a week in which he, or &s;ome of his brethren, were not called upon to take one of them into cu&s;tody. In one of the in&s;tances that came to our know|lege, the party had been &s;everely injured by the perfidy of women, and was mad with jealou&s;y before he made him&s;elf drunk with opium; and we were told, that the Indian who runs a muck is always fir&s;t driven to de&s;peration by &s;ome out|rage, and always fir&s;t revenges him&s;elf upon tho&s;e who have done him wrong: we were al&s;o told, that though the&s;e un|happy wretches afterwards run into the &s;treet with a weapon in their hand, frantic and foaming at the mouth, yet they never kill any but tho&s;e who attempt to apprehend them, or tho&s;e whom they &s;u&s;pect of &s;uch an intention, and that who|ever gives them way is &s;afe. They are generally &s;laves, who indeed are mo&s;t &s;ubject to in&s;ults, and lea&s;t able to obtain legal redre&s;s: freemen, however, are &s;ometimes provoked into this extravagance, and one of the per&s;ons who run a muck while we were at Batavia, was free and in ea&s;y circum|&s;tances. He was jealous of his own brother, whom he fir&s;t killed, and afterwards two others, who attempted to oppo&s;e
<PB N="755" REF="362">
him: he did not, however, come out of his hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> but en|deavoured to defend him&s;elf in it, though the opium had &s;o far deprived him of his &s;en&s;es, that of three mu&s;kets, which he attempted to u&s;e again&s;t the officers of ju&s;tice, not one was either loaded or primed. If the officer takes one of the&s;e amocks, or mohawks, as they have been called by an ea&s;y corruption, alive, his reward is very con&s;iderable, but if he kills them, nothing is added to his u&s;ual pay; yet &s;uch is the fury of their de&s;peration, that three out of four are of nece&s;&s;ity de&s;troyed in the attempt to &s;ecure them, though the officers are provided with in&s;truments like large tongs, or pincers, to lay hold of them without coming with|in the reach of their weapon. Tho&s;e who happen to be taken alive are generally wounded, but they are always broken alive upon the wheel, and if the phy&s;ician who is ap|pointed to examine their wounds, thinks them likely to be mortal, the puni&s;hment is inflicted immediately, and the place of execution is generally the &s;pot where the fir&s;t mur|der was committed.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e people, there are many ab&s;urd practices and opinions which they derive from their Pagan ance&s;tors: they believe that the devil, whom they call Satan, is the cau&s;e of all &s;ickne&s;s and adver&s;ity, and for this rea&s;on, when they are &s;ick, or in di&s;tre&s;s, they con&s;ecrate meat, money, and other things to him as a propitiation. If any one among them is re&s;tle&s;s, and dreams for two or three nights &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively, he concludes that Satan has taken that method of laying his commands upon him, which if he neglects to fulfil, he will certainly &s;uffer &s;ickne&s;s or death, though they are not revealed with &s;ufficient per&s;picuity to a&s;certain their meaning: to interpret his dream, therefore, he taxes his wits to the uttermo&s;t, and if, by taking it literally or figu|ratively, directly or by contraries, he can put no explanation
<PB N="756" REF="363">
upon it that perfectly &s;atisfies him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> he has recour&s;e to the cawin or prie&s;t, who a&s;&s;i&s;ts him with a comment and illu&s;|trations, and perfectly reveals the my&s;terious &s;ugge&s;tions of the night. It generally appears that the devil wants victuals or money, which are always allotted him, and being placed on a little plate of cocoa-nut leaves, are hung upon the branch of a tree near the river, &s;o that it &s;eems not to be the opinion of the&s;e people, that in prowling the earth the devil "walketh through dry places." Mr. Banks once a&s;ked, whether they thought Satan &s;pent the money, or eat the vic|tuals; he was an&s;wered, that as to the money it was con&s;idered rather as a mulct upon an offender, than a gift to him who had enjoined it, and that therefore if it was devoted by the dreamer, it mattered not into who&s;e hands it came, and they &s;uppo&s;ed that it was generally the prize of &s;ome &s;tranger who wandered that way; but as to the meat they were clearly of opinion that, although the devil did not eat the gro&s;s parts, yet, by bringing his mouth near it, he &s;ucked out all its &s;avour without changing its po&s;ition, &s;o that after|wards it was as ta&s;tele&s;s as water.</P>
<P>But they have another &s;uper&s;titious opinion that is &s;till more unaccountable. They believe that women, when they are delivered of children, are frequently at the &s;ame time delivered of a young crocodile, as a twin to the infant: they believe that the&s;e creatures are received mo&s;t carefully by the midwife, and immediately carried down to the river, and put into the water. The family in which &s;uch a birth is &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened, con&s;tantly put victuals into the river for their amphibious relation, and e&s;pecially the twin, who, as long as he lives, goes down to the river at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons, to fulfil this fraternal duty, for the neglect of which it is the univer&s;al opinion that he will be vi&s;ited with &s;ickne&s;s or death. What could at fir&s;t produce a notion &s;o
<PB N="757" REF="364">
extravagant and ab&s;urd, it is not ea&s;y to gue&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> e&s;pecially as it &s;eems to be totally unconnected with any religious my&s;tery, and how a fact which never happened, &s;hould be pretended to happen every day, by tho&s;e who cannot be deceived into a belief of it by appearances, nor have any apparent intere&s;t in the fraud, is a problem &s;till more difficult to &s;olve. No|thing however can be more certain than the firm belief of this &s;trange ab&s;urdity among them, for we had the concur|rent te&s;timony of every Indian who was que&s;tioned about it, in its favour. It &s;eems to have taken its ri&s;e in the i&s;lands of Celebes and Boutou, where many of the inhabitants keep crocodiles in their families; but however that be, the opinion has &s;pread over all the ea&s;tern i&s;lands, even to Timor and Ceram, and we&s;tward as far as Java and Sumatra, where, however, young crocodiles are, I believe, never kept.</P>
<P>The&s;e crocodile twins are called <HI>Sudaras,</HI> and I &s;hall relate one of the innumerable &s;tories that were told us, in proof of their exi&s;tence, from ocular demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>A young female &s;lave, who was born and bred up among the Engli&s;h at Bencoolen, and had learnt a little of the lan|guage, told Mr. Banks that her father, when he was dying, acquainted her that he had a crocodile for his <HI>&s;udara,</HI> and &s;olemnly charged her to give him meat when he &s;hould be dead, telling her in what part of the river he was to be found, and by what name he was to be called up. That in pur&s;uance of her father's in&s;tructions and command, &s;he went to the river, and &s;tanding upon the bank, called out <HI>Radja Pouti,</HI> white king, upon which a crocodile came to her out of the water, and eat from her hand the provi&s;ions that &s;he had brought him. When &s;he was de&s;ired to de&s;cribe this paternal uncle, who in &s;o &s;trange a &s;hape had taken up his dwelling in the water, &s;he &s;aid, that he was not like
<PB N="758" REF="365">
other crocodiles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> but much hand&s;omer; that his body was &s;potted and his no&s;e red; that he had bracelets of gold upon his feet, and earrings of the &s;ame metal in his ears. Mr. Banks heard this tale of ridiculous fal&s;ehood patiently to the end, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the girl, without reminding her, that a crocodile with ears was as &s;trange a mon&s;ter as a dog with a cloven foot. Some time after this a &s;ervant whom Mr. Banks had hired at Batavia, and who was the &s;on of a Dutch|man by a Javane&s;e woman, thought fit to acquaint his ma&s;|ter that he had &s;een a crocodile of the &s;ame kind, which had al&s;o been &s;een by many others, both Dutchmen and Malays: that being very young, it was but two feet long, and had bracelets of gold upon its feet. There is no giving credit to the&s;e &s;tories, &s;aid Mr. Banks, for I was told the other day that a crocodile had earrings; and you know that could not be true, becau&s;e crocodiles have no ears. Ah Sir, &s;aid the man, the&s;e Sudara Oran are not like other crocodiles; they have five toes upon each foot, a large tongue that fills their mouth, and ears al&s;o, although they are indeed very &s;mall.</P>
<P>How much of what the&s;e people related they believed, cannot be known; for there are no bounds to the credulity of ignorance and folly. In the girl's relation, however, there are &s;ome things in which &s;he could not be deceived; and therefore mu&s;t have been guilty of wilful fal&s;ehood. Her father might perhaps give her a charge to feed a crocodile, in con&s;equence of his believing that it was his Sudara; but its coming to her out of the river, when &s;he called it by the name of White King, and taking the food &s;he had brought it, mu&s;t have been a fable of her own invention; for this being fal&s;e, it was impo&s;&s;ible that &s;he &s;hould believe it to be true. The girl's &s;tory, however, as well as that of the man, is a &s;trong proof that they both firmly believed the exi&s;t|ence
<PB N="759" REF="366">
of crocodiles that are Sudaras to men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> and the girl's fiction will be ea&s;ily accounted for, if we recollect, that the earne&s;t de&s;ire which every one feels to make others believe what he believes him&s;elf, is a &s;trong temptation to &s;upport it by unju&s;tifiable evidence. And the averring what is known to be fal&s;e, in order to produce in others the belief of what is thought to be true, mu&s;t, upon the mo&s;t charitable principles, be imputed to many, otherwi&s;e venerable charac|ters, through who&s;e hands the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity pa&s;&s;ed for many ages in their way to us, as the &s;ource of all the &s;illy fables related of the Romi&s;h &s;aints, many of them not le&s;s extravagant and ab&s;urd than this &s;tory of the White King, and all of them the invention of the fir&s;t relater.</P>
<P>The Bougis, Maca&s;&s;ars, and Boetons, are &s;o firmly per|&s;uaded that they have relations of the crocodile &s;pecies in the rivers of their own country, that they perform a periodi|cal ceremony in remembrance of them. Large parties of them go out in a boat, furni&s;hed with great plenty of provi|&s;ions, and all kinds of mu&s;ic, and row backwards and for|wards, in places where crocodiles and allegators are mo&s;t common, &s;inging and weeping by turns, each invoking his kindred, till a crocodile appears, when the mu&s;ic in&s;tantly &s;tops, and provi&s;ions, betele, and tobacco are thrown into the water. By this civility to the &s;pecies, they hope to recom|mend them&s;elves to their relations at home; and that it will be accepted in&s;tead of offerings immediately to them&s;elves, which it is not in their power to pay.</P>
<P>In the next rank to the Indians &s;tand the Chine&s;e, who in this place are numerous, but po&s;&s;e&s;s very little property; many of them live within the walls, and keep &s;hops. The fruit-&s;ellers of Pa&s;&s;ar Pi&s;&s;ang have been mentioned already; but others have a rich &s;how of European and Chine&s;e goods:
<PB N="760" REF="367">
the far greater part however live in a quarter by them&s;elves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> without the walls, called Campang China. Many of them are carpenters, joiners, &s;miths, taylors, &s;lipper makers, dyers of cotton, and embroiderers; maintaining the character of in|du&s;try that is univer&s;ally given of them: and &s;ome are &s;cat|tered about the country, where they cultivate gardens, fow rice and &s;ugar, or keep cattle and buffaloes, who&s;e milk they bring daily to town.</P>
<P>There is nothing clean or dirty, hone&s;t or di&s;hone&s;t, pro|vided there is not too much danger of a halter, that the Chi|ne&s;e will not readily do for money. But though they work with great diligence, and patiently undergo any degree of labour; yet no &s;ooner have they laid down their tools than they begin to game, either at cards or dice, or &s;ome other play among the multitude that they have invented, which are al|together unknown in Europe: to this they apply with &s;uch eagerne&s;s, as &s;carcely to allow time for the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;h|ments of food and &s;leep; &s;o that it as rare to &s;ee a Chine&s;e idle, as it is to &s;ee a Dutchman or an Indian employed.</P>
<P>In manners they are always civil, or rather ob&s;equious; and in dre&s;s they are remarkably neat and clean, to what|ever rank of life they belong. I &s;hall not attempt a de&s;crip|tion either of their per&s;ons or habits, for the better kind of China paper, which is now common in England, exhibits a perfect repre&s;entation of both, though perhaps with &s;ome &s;light exaggerations approaching towards the caricatura.</P>
<P>In eating they are ea&s;ily &s;atisfied, though the few that are rich have many &s;avory di&s;hes. Rice, with a &s;mall propor|tion of fle&s;h or fi&s;h, is the food of the poor; and they have greatly the advantage of the Mahometan Indians, who&s;e re|ligion forbids them to eat of many things which they could mo&s;t ea&s;ily procure. The Chine&s;e, on the contrary, being
<PB N="761" REF="368">
under no re&s;traint, eat, be&s;ides pork, dogs, cats, frogs, lizards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> &s;erpents of many kinds, and a great variety of &s;ea animals, which the other inhabitants of this country do not con&s;ider as food: they eat al&s;o many vegetables, which an European, except he was peri&s;hing with hunger, would never touch.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e have a &s;ingular &s;uper&s;tition with regard to the burial of their dead; for they will upon no occa&s;ion open the ground a &s;econd time, where a body has been interred. Their burying grounds, therefore, in the neighbourhood of Batavia, cover many hundred acres, and the Dutch, grudging the wa&s;te of &s;o much land, will not &s;ell any for this purpo&s;e but at the mo&s;t exorbitant price. The Chine&s;e, however, contrive to rai&s;e the purcha&s;e money, and afford another in|&s;tance of the folly and weakne&s;s of human nature, in tran&s;|ferring a regard for the living to the dead, and making that the object of &s;olicitude and expence, which cannot receive the lea&s;t benefit from either. Under the influence of this univer&s;al prejudice, they take an uncommon method to pre|&s;erve the body intire, and prevent the remains of it from being mixed with the earth that &s;urrounds it. They inclo&s;e it in a large thick coffin of wood, not made of planks joined together, but hollowed out of the &s;olid timber like a canoe; this being covered, and let down into the grave, is &s;urrounded with a coat of their mortar, called Chinam, about eight or ten inches thick, which in a &s;hort time becomes as hard as a &s;tone. The relations of the decea&s;ed attend the funeral ceremony, with a con&s;iderable number of women that are hired to weep: it might rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed that the hired appearance of &s;orrow could no more &s;latter the living than benefit the dead; yet the appearance of &s;orrow is known to be hired among people much more reflective and enlightened than the Chine&s;e. In Batavia, the law re|quires
<PB N="762" REF="369">
that every man &s;hould be buried according to his rank,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> which is in no ca&s;e di&s;pen&s;ed with; &s;o that if the de|cea&s;ed has not left &s;ufficient to pay his debts, an officer takes an inventory of what was in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion when he died, and out of the produce buries him in the manner pre&s;cribed, leaving only the overplus to his creditors. Thus in many in&s;tances are the living &s;acrificed to the dead, and money that &s;hould di&s;charge a debt, or feed an orphan, lavi&s;hed in idle proce&s;&s;ions, or depo&s;ited in the earth to rot.</P>
<P>Another numerous cla&s;s among the inhabitants of this country is the &s;laves; for by &s;laves the Dutch, Portugue&s;e, and Indians, however different in their rank or &s;ituation, are con&s;tantly attended: they are purcha&s;ed from Sumatra, Malacca, and almo&s;t all the ea&s;tern i&s;lands. The natives of Java, very few of whom, as I have before ob&s;erved, live in the neighbourhood of Batavia, have an exemption from &s;la|very under the &s;anction of very &s;evere penal laws, which I believe are &s;eldom violated. The price of the&s;e &s;laves is from ten to twenty pounds &s;terling; but girls, if they have beauty, &s;ometimes fetch a hundred. They are a very lazy &s;et of people; but as they will do but little work, they are content with a little victuals, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting altogether upon boiled rice, and a &s;mall quantity of the cheape&s;t fi&s;h. As they are na|tives of different countries, they differ from each other ex|tremely, both in per&s;on and di&s;po&s;ition. The African negroes, called here <HI>Papua,</HI> are the wor&s;t, and con&s;equently may be purcha&s;ed for the lea&s;t money: they are all thieves, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncorrigible. Next to the&s;e are the Bougis and Maca&s;&s;ars, both from the i&s;land of Celebes; the&s;e are lazy in the high|e&s;t degree, and though not &s;o much addicted to theft as the negroes, have a cruel and vindictive &s;pirit, which renders them extremely dangerous; e&s;pecially as, to gratify their
<PB N="763" REF="370">
re&s;entment, they will make no &s;cruple of &s;acrificing life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> The be&s;t &s;laves, and con&s;equently the deare&s;t, are procured from the i&s;land of Bali: the mo&s;t beautiful women from Nias, a &s;mall i&s;land on the coa&s;t of Sumatra; but they are of a tender and delicate con&s;titution, and &s;oon fall a &s;acrifice to the unwhole&s;ome air of Batavia. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are Malays, and &s;laves of &s;everal other denominations, who&s;e particular characteristics I do not remember.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;laves are wholly in the power of their ma&s;ters with re&s;pect to any puni&s;hment that does not take away life; but if a &s;lave dies in con&s;equence of puni&s;hment, though his death &s;hould not appear to have been intended, the ma&s;ter is called to a &s;evere account, and he is generally condemned to &s;uffer capitally. For this rea&s;on the ma&s;ter &s;eldom inflicts puni&s;hment upon the &s;lave him&s;elf, but applies to an officer called a Marineu, one of whom is &s;tationed in every di&s;trict. The duty of the Marineu is to quell riots, and take offenders into cu&s;tody; but more particularly to apprehend runaway &s;laves, and puni&s;h them for &s;uch crimes as the ma&s;ter, &s;up|ported by proper evidence, lays to their charge: the puni&s;h|ment however is not inflicted by the Marineu in per&s;on, but by &s;laves who are bred up to the bu&s;ine&s;s. Men are puni&s;hed publicly, before the door of their ma&s;ter's hou&s;e; but women within it. The puni&s;hment is by &s;tripes, the number being proportioned to the offence; and they are given with rods made of rattans, which are &s;plit into &s;lender twigs for the purpo&s;e, and fetch blood at every &s;troke. A common pu|ni&s;hment co&s;ts the ma&s;ter a rixdollar, and a &s;evere one a du|catoon, about &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence. The ma&s;ter is al&s;o obliged to allow the &s;lave three dubbeleheys, equal to about &s;even pence half-penny a week, as an encouragement, and to prevent his being under temptations to &s;teal too &s;trong to be re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="764" REF="371"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE>Concerning the government of this place I can &s;ay but little. We ob&s;erved however a remarkable &s;ubordination among the people. Every man who is able to keep hou&s;e has a certain &s;pecific rank acquired by the length of his &s;er|vices to the company; the different ranks which are thus acquired are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the ornaments of the coaches and the dre&s;&s;es of the coachmen: &s;ome are obliged to ride in plain coaches, &s;ome are allowed to paint them in different manners and degrees, and &s;ome to gild them. The coach|man al&s;o appears in clothes that are quite plain, or more or le&s;s adorned with lace.</P>
<P>The officer who pre&s;ides here has the title of Governor General of the Indies, and the Dutch Governors of all the other &s;ettlements are &s;ubordinate to him, and obliged to re|pair to Batavia that he may pa&s;s their accounts. If they ap|pear to have been criminal, or even negligent, he puni&s;hes them by delay, and detains them during plea&s;ure, &s;ome|times one year, &s;ometimes two years, and &s;ometimes three; for they cannot quit the place till he gives them a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. Next to the Governor are the members of the council, called here <HI>Edele Heeren,</HI> and by the corruption of the Engli&s;h, <HI>Ido|leers.</HI> The&s;e Idoleers take upon them &s;o much &s;tate that whoever meets them in a carriage, is expected to ri&s;e up and bow, then to drive on one &s;ide of the road, and there &s;top till they are pa&s;t: the &s;ame homage is required al&s;o to their wives and even their children; and it is commonly paid them by the inhabitants. But &s;ome of our Captains have thought &s;o &s;lavi&s;h a mark of re&s;pect beneath the dignity which they derived from the &s;ervice of his Britannic Maje&s;ty, and have refu&s;ed to pay it; yet, if they were in a hired carriage, no|thing could deter the coachman from honouring the Dutch Grandee at their expence, but the mo&s;t peremptory menace of immediate death.</P>
<P><PB N="765" REF="372">Ju&s;tice is admini&s;tered here by a body of lawyers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> who have ranks of di&s;tinction among them&s;elves. Concerning their proceedings in que&s;tions of property, I know nothing; but their deci&s;ions in criminal ca&s;es &s;eem to be &s;evere with re&s;pect to the natives, and lenient with re&s;pect to their own people, in a criminal degree. A Chri&s;tian always is in|dulged with an opportunity of e&s;caping before he is brought to a trial, whatever may have been his offence; and if he is brought to a trial and convicted, he is &s;eldom puni&s;hed with death: while the poor Indians on the contrary are hanged, and broken upon the wheel, and even impaled alive with|out mercy.</P>
<P>The Malays and Chine&s;e have judicial officers of their own, under the denominations of Captains and Lieutenants, who determine in civil ca&s;es, &s;ubject to an appeal to the Dutch court.</P>
<P>The taxes paid by the&s;e people to the Company are very con&s;iderable; and that which is exacted of them for liberty to wear their hair, is by no means the lea&s;t. They are paid monthly, and to &s;ave the trouble and charge of collecting them, a &s;lag is hoi&s;ted upon the top of a hou&s;e in the middle of the town when a payment is due, and the Chine&s;e have experienced that it is their intere&s;t to repair thither with their money without delay.</P>
<P>The money current here con&s;i&s;ts of ducats, worth a hun|dred and thirty-two &s;tivers; ducatoons, eighty &s;tivers; im|perial rixdollars, &s;ixty; rupees of Batavia, thirty; &s;chellings, &s;ix; double cheys, two &s;tivers and a half; and doits, one fourth of a &s;tiver. Spani&s;h dollars, when we were here, were at five &s;hillings and five pence; and we were told, that they were never lower than five &s;hillings and four pence, even at
<PB N="766" REF="373">
the Company's warehou&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. December.</NOTE> For Engli&s;h guineas we could never get more than nineteen &s;hillings upon an average; for though the Chine&s;e would give twenty &s;hillings for &s;ome of the brighte&s;t, they would give no more than &s;eventeen &s;hillings for tho&s;e that were much worn.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be of &s;ome advantage to &s;trangers to be told that there are two kinds of coin here, of the &s;ame de|nomination, milled and unmilled, and that the milled is of mo&s;t value. A milled ducatoon is worth eighty &s;tivers; but an unmilled ducatoon is worth no more than &s;eventy-two. All accounts are kept in rixdollars and &s;tivers, which, here at lea&s;t, are mere nominal coins, like our pound &s;terling. The rixdollar is equal to forty-eight &s;tivers, about four &s;hillings and &s;ix pence Engli&s;h currency.</P>

<P>We continued our cour&s;e as the wind permitted us till three o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 5.</NOTE> when we anchored under the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide of Prince's I&s;land in eighteen fa|thom, in order to recruit our wood and water, and procure refre&s;hments for the &s;ick, many of whom were now become much wor&s;e than they were when we left Batavia. As &s;oon as the &s;hip was &s;ecured, I went a&s;hore accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr Solander, and we were met upon the beach by &s;ome Indians who carried us immediately to a man, who, they &s;aid, was their King. After we had exchanged a few compliments with his Maje&s;ty, we proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s; but
<PB N="768" REF="375">
in &s;ettling the price of turtle we could not agree:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. January. Saturday 5.</NOTE> this how|ever did not di&s;courage us, as we made no doubt but that we &s;hould buy them at our own price in the morning. As &s;oon as we parted, the Indians di&s;per&s;ed, and we proceeded along the &s;hore in &s;earch of a watering-place. In this we were more &s;ucce&s;sful; we found water very conveniently &s;ituated, and, if a little care was taken in filling it, we had rea&s;on to believe that it would prove good. Ju&s;t as we were going off, &s;ome Indians, who remained with a canoe upon the beach, &s;old us three turtle; but exacted a promi&s;e of us that we &s;hould not tell the King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 6.</NOTE>The next morning, while a party was employed in filling water, we renewed our traffic for turtle: at fir&s;t, the In|dians dropped their demands &s;lowly, but about noon, they agreed to take the price that we offered, &s;o that before night we had turtle in plenty: the three that we had purcha&s;ed the evening before, were in the mean time &s;erved to the &s;hip's company, who, till the day before, had not once been &s;erved with &s;alt provi&s;ions from the time of our arrival at Savu, which was now near four months In the evening, Mr. Banks went to pay his re&s;pects to the King, at his palace, in the middle of a rice field, and though his Maje&s;ty was bu&s;ily employed in dre&s;&s;ing his own &s;upper, he received the &s;tranger very graciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The next day, the natives came down to the trading-place, with fowls, fi&s;h, monkies, &s;mall deer, and &s;ome vegetables, but no turtle, for they &s;aid that we had bought them all the day before. The next day, however, more turtle appeared at market, and &s;ome were brought down every day after|wards, during our &s;tay, though the whole, together, was not equal to the quantity that we bought the day after our arrival.</P>
<P><PB N="769" REF="376">On the 11th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. January. Friday 11.</NOTE> Mr. Banks having learnt from the &s;ervant whom he had hired at Batavia, that the Indians of this i&s;land had a town upon the &s;hore, at &s;ome di&s;tance to the we&s;tward, he determined to &s;ee it: with this view he &s;et out in the morning, accompanied by the Second Lieutenant, and as he had &s;ome rea&s;on to think that his vi&s;it would not be agree|able to the inhabitants, he told the people whom he met, as he was advancing along the &s;hore, that he was in &s;earch of plants, which indeed was al&s;o true. In about two hours they arrived at a place where there were four or five hou&s;es, and meeting with an old man, they ventured to make &s;ome enquiries concerning the town. He &s;aid that it was far di&s;tant; but they were not to be di&s;couraged in their enter|pri&s;e, and he, &s;eeing them proceed in their journey, joined company and went on with them. He attempted &s;everal times to lead them out of the way, but without &s;ucce&s;s; and at length they came within fight of the hou&s;es. The old man then entered cordially into their party, and conducted them into the town. The name of it is Samadang, it con&s;i&s;ts of about four hundred hou&s;es, and is divided by a river of bracki&s;h water into two parts, one of which is called the old town and the other the new. As &s;oon as they entered the old town, they met &s;everal Indians whom they had &s;een at the trading-place, and one of them undertook to carry them over to the new town, at the rate of two pence a head. When the bargain was made, two very &s;mall canoes were pro|duced, in which they embarked; the canoes being placed along&s;ide of each other, and held together, a precaution which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;sary to prevent their over&s;etting, the navigation was at length &s;afely performed, though not with|out &s;ome difficulty; and when they landed in the new town, the people received them with great friend&s;hip, and &s;howed them the hou&s;es of their Kings and principal people, which
<PB N="770" REF="377">
are in this di&s;trict:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. January. Friday 11.</NOTE> few of them however were open, for at this time the people had taken up their re&s;idence in the rice-grounds, to defend the crop again&s;t the birds and mon|kies, by which it would otherwi&s;e have been de&s;troyed. When their curio&s;ity was &s;atisfied, they hired a large &s;ailing boat for two roupees, four &s;hillings, which brought them back to the &s;hip time enough to dine upon one of the &s;mall deer, weighing only forty pounds, which had been bought the day before, and proved to be very good and &s;avory meat.</P>
<P>We went on &s;hore in the evening, to &s;ee how the people who were employed in wooding and watering went on, and were informed that an ax had been &s;tolen. As the pa&s;&s;ing over this fault might encourage the commi&s;&s;ion of others of the &s;ame kind, application was immediately made to the King, who after &s;ome altercation promi&s;ed that the ax &s;hould be re&s;tored in the morning;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 12.</NOTE> and kept his word, for it was brought to us by a man who pretended that the thief, being afraid of a di&s;covery, had privately brought it and left it at his hou&s;e in the night.</P>
<P>We continued to purcha&s;e between two and three hundred weight of turtle in a day, be&s;ides fowls and other nece&s;&s;aries; and in the evening of the 13th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 13.</NOTE> having nearly completed our wood and water, Mr. Banks went a&s;hore to take leave of his Maje&s;ty, to whom he had made &s;everal trifling pre|&s;ents, and at parting gave him two quires of paper, which he graciou&s;ly received. They had much conver&s;ation, in the cour&s;e of which his Maje&s;ty enquired, why the Engli&s;h did not touch there as they had been u&s;ed to do. Mr. Banks replied, that he &s;uppo&s;ed it was becau&s;e they found a defi|ciency of turtle, of which there not being enough to &s;upply one &s;hip, many could not be expected. To &s;upply this de|fect, he advi&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to breed cattle, buffaloes, and

The deer however &s;erved only for pre&s;ent u&s;e, for we could &s;el|dom keep one of them alive more than four and twenty hours after it was on board. On our part, the trade was carried on chiefly with Spani&s;h dollars, the natives &s;eeming to &s;et little value upon any thing el&s;e; &s;o that our people, who had a general permi&s;&s;ion to trade, parted with old &s;hirts and other articles, which they were obliged to &s;ub&s;ti|tute for money to great di&s;advantage.

<P>Prince's I&s;land, where we lay about ten days, is, in the Malay language, called <HI>Pulo Selan</HI>; and in the language of the inhabitants, <HI>Pulo Paneitan.</HI> It is a &s;mall i&s;land, &s;ituated in the we&s;tern mouth of the Streight of Sunda. It is woody, and a very &s;mall part of it only has been cleared: there is no remarkable hill upon it, yet the Engli&s;h call the &s;mall eminence which is ju&s;t over the landing-place the Pike. It was formerly much frequented by the India &s;hips of many nations, but e&s;pecially tho&s;e of England, which of late have for&s;aken it, as it is &s;aid, becau&s;e the water is bad; and touch either at North I&s;land, a &s;mall i&s;land that lies on the coa&s;t of Sumatra, without the ea&s;t entrance of the Streight, or at New Bay, which lies only a few leagues from Prince's I&s;land, at neither of which places any con&s;iderable quantity
<PB N="772" REF="379">
of other refre&s;hments can be procured.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. January. Tue&s;day 15.</NOTE> Prince's I&s;land is, upon the whole, certainly more eligible than either of them; and though the water is bracki&s;h, if it is filled at the lower part of the brook, yet higher up it will be found excellent.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and &s;econd, and perhaps the third &s;hip that comes in the &s;ea&s;on may be tolerably &s;upplied with turtle; but tho&s;e that come afterwards mu&s;t be content with &s;mall ones. Tho&s;e that we bought were of the green kind, and at an average co&s;t us about a half-penny or three farthings a pound. We were much di&s;appointed to find them neither fat nor well fla|voured; and we imputed it to their having been long kept in crawls or pens of bracki&s;h water, without food. The fowls are large, and we bought a dozen of them for a Spa|ni&s;h dollar, which is about five pence a piece: the &s;mall deer co&s;t us two pence a piece, and the larger, of which two only were brought down, a rupee. Many kinds of fi&s;h are to be had here, which the natives &s;ell by hand, and we found them tolerably cheap. Cocoa-nuts we bought at the rate of a hundred for a dollar, if they were picked; and if they were taken promi&s;cuou&s;ly, one hundred and thirty. Plan|tains we found in great plenty; we procured al&s;o &s;ome pine apples, water melons, jaccas, and pumpkins; be&s;ides rice, the greater part of which was of the mountain kind, that grows in dry land; yams, and &s;everal other vegetables, at a very rea&s;onable rate.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are Javane&s;e, who&s;e Raja is &s;ubject to the Sultan of Bantam. Their cu&s;toms are very &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Indians about Batavia; but they &s;eem to be more jealous of their women, for we never &s;aw any of them during all the time that we were there, except one by chance in the woods, as &s;he was running away to hide her&s;elf. They pro|fe&s;s the Mahometan religion, but I believe there is not a
<PB N="773" REF="380">
mo&s;que in the whole i&s;land:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. January.</NOTE> we were among them during the fa&s;t, which the Turks call <HI>Ramadan,</HI> which they &s;eemed to keep with great rigour, for not one of them would touch a mor&s;el of victuals, or even chew their betel till &s;un-&s;et.</P>
<P>Their food is nearly the &s;ame as that of the Batavian In|dians, except the addition of the nuts of the palm, called <HI>Cycas circinalis,</HI> with which, upon the coa&s;t of New Holland, &s;ome of our people were made &s;ick, and &s;ome of our hogs poi&s;oned.</P>
<P>Upon ob&s;erving the&s;e nuts to be part of their food, we en|quired by what means they deprived them of their deleterious quality; and they told us, that they fir&s;t cut them into thin &s;lices, and dried them in the &s;un, then &s;teeped them in fre&s;h water for three months, and afterwards, pre&s;&s;ing out the water, dried them in the &s;un a &s;econd time; but we learnt that, after all, they are eaten only in times of &s;carcity, when they mix them with their rice to make it go farther.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of their town are built upon piles, or pillars, four or five feet above the ground: upon the&s;e is laid a floor of bamboo canes, which are placed at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, &s;o as to leave a free pa&s;&s;age for the air from be|low: the walls al&s;o are of bamboo, which are interwoven, hurdlewi&s;e, with &s;mall &s;ticks, that are fa&s;tened perpen|dicularly to the beams which form the frame of the build|ing: it has a &s;loping roof, which is &s;o well thatched with palm leaves, that neither the &s;un nor the rain can find en|trance. The ground over which this building is created, is an oblong &s;quare. In the middle of one &s;ide is the door, and in the middle between that and the end of the hou&s;e, towards the left hand, is a window: a partition runs out from each end towards the middle, which, if continued, would divide the whole floor into two equal parts, longitu|dinally,
<PB N="774" REF="381">
but they do not meet in the middle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. January.</NOTE> &s;o that an open|ing is left over-again&s;t the door; each end of the hou&s;e therefore, to the right and left of the door, is divided into two rooms, like &s;talls in a &s;table, all open towards the pa&s;|&s;age from the door to the wall on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide: in that next the door, to the left hand, the children &s;leep; that op|po&s;ite to it, on the right hand, is allotted to &s;trangers; the ma&s;ter and his wife &s;leep in the inner room on the left hand, and that oppo&s;ite to it is the kitchen. There is no difference between the hou&s;es of the poor and the rich, but in the &s;ize; except that the royal palace, and the hou&s;e of a man, who&s;e name is <HI>Gundang,</HI> the next in riches and influence to the King, is walled with boards in&s;tead of being wattled with &s;ticks and bamboo.</P>
<P>As the people are obliged to abandon the town, and live in the rice-fields at certain &s;ea&s;ons, to &s;ecure their crops from the birds and the monkies, they have occa&s;ional hou&s;es there for their accommodation. They are exactly the &s;ame as the hou&s;es in the town, except that they are &s;maller, and are elevated eight or ten feet above the ground in&s;tead of four.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the people, as far as we could di&s;|cover it, is good. They dealt with us very hone&s;tly, except, like all other Indians, and the itinerant retailers of fi&s;h in London, they a&s;ked &s;ometimes twice, and &s;ometimes thrice as much for their commodities as they would take. As what they brought to market, belonged, in different proportions, to a con&s;iderable number of the natives, and it would have been difficult to purcha&s;e it in &s;eparate lots, they found out a very ea&s;y expedient with which every one was &s;atisfied: they put all that was bought of one kind, as plantains, or cocoa-nuts, together, and when we had agreed for the heap, they divided the money that was paid for it, among tho&s;e
<PB N="775" REF="382">
of who&s;e &s;eparate property it con&s;i&s;ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. January.</NOTE> in a proportion cor|re&s;ponding with their contributions. Sometimes, indeed, they changed our money, giving us 240 doits, amounting to five &s;hillings, for a Spani&s;h dollar, and ninety-&s;ix, amount|ing to two &s;hillings, for a Bengal roupee.</P>
<P>They all &s;peak the Malay language, though they have a language of their own, different both from the Malay and the Javane&s;e. Their own language they call <HI>Catta Gunung,</HI> the language of the mountains; and they &s;ay that it is &s;poken upon the mountains of Java, whence their tribe ori|ginally migrated, fir&s; to New Bay, and then to their pre&s;ent &s;tation, being driven from their fir&s;t &s;ettlement by tygers, which they found too numerous to &s;ubdue. I have already ob&s;erved, that &s;everal languages are &s;poken by the native Ja|vane&s;e, in different parts of their i&s;land; but when I &s;ay that the language of the&s;e people is different from the Javane&s;e, I mean that it is different from the language which is &s;poken at Samarang, a place that is di&s;tant only one day's journey from the re&s;idence of the emperor of Java. The following is a li&s;t of corre&s;ponding words in the languages of Prince's I&s;land, Java, and Malacca.</P>

<P>In the language of Madaga&s;car, there are other words &s;imilar to words of the &s;ame import in the Malay. The no&s;e in Malay is called <HI>Erung,</HI> at Madaga&s;car <HI>Ourou; Lida,</HI> the
<PB N="778" REF="385">
tongue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. January.</NOTE> is <HI>Lala; Tangan,</HI> the hand, is <HI>Tang</HI>; and <HI>Tanna,</HI> the ground, is <HI>Taan.</HI></P>
<P>From the &s;imilitude between the language of the Ea&s;tern Indies, and the i&s;lands of the South Sea, conjectures may be formed with re&s;pect to the peopling tho&s;e countries, which cannot ea&s;ily be referred to Madaga&s;car. The inhabitants of Java and Madaga&s;car appear to be a different race; the Java|ne&s;e is of an olive complexion, and has long hair; the native of Madaga&s;car is black, and his head is not covered with hair, but wool; and yet perhaps this will not conclude again&s;t their having common ance&s;tors &s;o &s;trongly as at fir&s;t appears. It does not &s;eem le&s;s difficult to account for the per&s;onal difference between a native of England and France, as an effect of mere local &s;ituation, than for the difference between the natives of Java and Madaga&s;car; yet it has never been &s;uppo&s;ed, that England and France were not peopled from common ance&s;tors. If two natives of England marry in their own country, and afterwards remove to our &s;ettle|ments in the We&s;t Indies, the children that are conceived and born there will have the complexion and ca&s;t of countenance that di&s;tingui&s;h the Creole; if they return, the children con|ceived and born afterwards, will have no &s;uch characteri&s;tics. If it be &s;aid that the mother's mind being impre&s;&s;ed with dif|ferent external objects, impre&s;&s;es corre&s;ponding features and complexion upon the child during her pregnancy, it will be as difficult to refer the effect into this cau&s;e, upon mere phy&s;ical principles, as into the other; for it can no more be &s;hewn how a mere idea, conceived in the mother's imagina|tion, can change the corporeal form of her infant, than how its form can be changed by mere local &s;ituation. We know that people within the &s;mall circle of Great Britain and Ire|land, who are born at the di&s;tance of two or three hundred miles from each other, will be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Scotch
<PB N="779" REF="386">
face, the Wel&s;h face, and the Iri&s;h face;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. January.</NOTE> may we not then rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that there are in nature qualities which act powerfully as efficient cau&s;es, and yet are not cognizable by any of the five modes of perception which we call &s;en&s;es? A deaf man, who &s;ees the &s;tring of a harp&s;ichord vibrate, when a corre&s;ponding tone is produced by blowing into a flute at a di&s;tance, will &s;ee an effect of which he can no more conceive the cau&s;e to exi&s;t in the blowing air into the flute, than we can conceive the cau&s;e of the per&s;onal difference of the various inhabitants of the globe to exi&s;t in mere local &s;ituation; nor can he any more form an idea of the cau&s;e it|&s;elf, in one ca&s;e, than we can in the other: what happens to him then, in con&s;equence of having but four &s;en&s;es in&s;tead of five, may, with re&s;pect to many phaenomena of nature, happen to us, in con&s;equence of having but five &s;en&s;es in|&s;tead of &s;ix, or any greater number.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly, however, the learning of ancient Aegypt might run in two cour&s;es, one through Africa, and the other through A&s;ia, di&s;&s;eminating the &s;ame words in each, e&s;pe|cially terms of number, which might thus become part of the language of people who never had any communication with each other.</P>
<P>We now made the be&s;t of our way for the Cape of Good Hope, but the &s;eeds of di&s;ea&s;e which we had received at Ba|tavia began to appear with the mo&s;t threatening &s;ymptoms in dy&s;enteries and &s;low fevers. Le&s;t the water which we had taken in at Prince's I&s;land &s;hould have had any &s;hare in our &s;ickne&s;s, we purified it with lime, and we wa&s;hed all parts of the &s;hip between decks with vinegar, as a remedy again&s;t infection. Mr. Banks was among the &s;ick, and for &s;ome time there was no hope of his life. We were very &s;oon in a mo&s;t deplorable &s;ituation; the &s;hip was nothing better than
<PB N="780" REF="387">
an ho&s;pital,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. January.</NOTE> in which tho&s;e that were able to go about, were too few to attend the &s;ick, who were confined to their ham|mocks; and we had almo&s;t every night a dead body to com|mit to the &s;ea. In the cour&s;e of about &s;ix weeks, we buried Mr. Sporing, a gentleman who was in Mr. Banks's retinue, Mr. Parkin&s;on, his natural hi&s;tory painter, Mr. Green the a&s;tronomer, the boat&s;wain, the carpenter and his mate, Mr. Monkhou&s;e the mid&s;hipman, who had fothered the &s;hip after &s;he had been &s;tranded on the coa&s;t of New Holland, our old jolly &s;ail-maker and his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, the &s;hip's cook, the corporal of the marines, two of the carpenter's crew, a mid|&s;hipman, and nine &s;eamen; in all three and twenty per&s;ons, be&s;ides the &s;even that we buried at Batavia.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> Our Arrival at the Cape of Good Hope; &s;ome Remarks on the Run from Java Head to that Place; a De&s;cription of the Cape, and of Saint Helena: With &s;ome Account of the Hottentots, and the Return of the Ship to England.</HEAD>
<P>ON Friday the 15th of March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. March. Friday 15.</NOTE> about ten o'clock in the morning, we anchored off the Cape of Good Hope, in &s;even fathom with an ouzey bottom. The we&s;t point of the bay, called the Lion's Tail, bore W. N. W. and the ca&s;tle S. W. di&s;tant about a mile and a half. I immediately waited upon the Governor, who told me that I &s;hould have every thing the country afforded. My fir&s;t care was to provide a proper place a&s;hore for the &s;ick, which were not a few; and a hou&s;e was &s;oon found, where it was agreed they &s;hould be lodged and boarded at the rate of two &s;hillings a head per day.</P>
<P>Our run from Java head, to this place, afforded very few &s;ubjects of remark that can be of u&s;e to future navigators; &s;uch as occurred, however, I &s;hall &s;et down. We had left Java Head eleven days before we got the general &s;outh ea&s;t trade-wind, during which time, we did not advance above 5&deg; to the &s;outhward, and 3&deg; to the we&s;t, having variable light airs, interrupted by calms, with &s;ultry weather, and an unwhole&s;ome air, occa&s;ioned probably by the load of va|pours which the ea&s;tern trade-wind, and we&s;terly mon&s;oons, bring into the&s;e latitudes, both which blow in the&s;e &s;eas at the time of year when we happened to be there. The ea&s;t|erly
<PB N="782" REF="389">
wind prevails as far as 10 or 12&deg; S. and the we&s;terly as far as 6 or 8&deg;;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. March. Friday 15.</NOTE> in the intermediate &s;pace the winds are vari|able, and the air, I believe, always unwhole&s;ome; it cer|tainly aggravated the di&s;ea&s;es which we brought with us from Batavia, and particularly the flux, which was not in the lea&s;t degree checked by any medicine, &s;o that whoever was &s;eized with it, con&s;idered him&s;elf as a dead man; but we had no &s;ooner got into the trade-wind, than we began to feel its &s;alutary effects: we buried indeed &s;everal of our people afterwards, but they were &s;uch as had been taken on board in a &s;tate &s;o low and feeble that there was &s;carcely a po&s;&s;ibility of their recovery. At fir&s;t we &s;u&s;pected that this dreadful di&s;order might have been brought upon us by the water that we took on board at Prince's I&s;land, or even by the turtle that we bought there; but there is not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to believe that this &s;u&s;picion was well grounded, for all the &s;hips that came from Batavia at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, &s;uf|fered in the &s;ame degree, and &s;ome of them even more &s;everely, though none of them touched at Prince's I&s;land in their way.</P>
<P>A few days after we left Java, we &s;aw boobies about the &s;hip for &s;everal nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and as the&s;e birds are known to roo&s;t every night on &s;hore, we thought them an indication that &s;ome i&s;land was not far di&s;tant; perhaps it might be the i&s;land of Selam, which, in different charts, is very differently laid down both in name and &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The variation of the compa&s;s off the we&s;t coa&s;t of Java is about 3&deg; W. and &s;o it continued without any &s;en&s;ible varia|tion, in the common track of &s;hips to the longitude of 288&deg; W. latitude 22 S. after which it increa&s;ed apace, &s;o that in longitude 295&deg;, latitude 230&deg;, the variation was 10&deg; 20&prime; W.: in &s;even degrees more of longitude, and one of latitude, it in|crea&s;ed
<PB N="783" REF="390">
two degrees; in the &s;ame &s;pace, farther to the we&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. March. Friday 15.</NOTE> it increa&s;ed five degrees: in latitude 28&deg;, longitude 314&deg;, it was 24&deg; 20&prime;, in latitude 29&deg; longitude 317&deg;, it was 26&deg; 10&prime;, and was then &s;tationary for the &s;pace of about ten degrees farther to the we&s;t; but in latitude 34&deg;, longitude 333&deg;, we ob&s;erved it twice to be 28&deg;&frac14; W. and this was its greate&s;t varia|tion, for in latitude 35&deg;&frac12;, longitude 337&deg;, it was 24&deg;, and continued gradually to decrea&s;e; &s;o that off Cape Anguillas it was 22&deg; 30&prime;, and in Table Bay 20&deg; 30&prime; W.</P>
<P>As to currents it did not appear that they were at all con|&s;iderable, till we came within a little di&s;tance of the meridian of Madaga&s;car; for after we had made 52&deg; of longitude from Java Head, we found, by ob&s;ervation, that our error in lon|gitude was only two degrees, and it was the &s;ame when we had made only nineteen. This error might be owing partly to a current &s;etting to the we&s;tward, partly to our not making proper allowances for the &s;etting of the &s;ea before which we run, and perhaps to an error in the a&s;&s;umed longitude of Java Head. If that longitude is erroneous, the error mu&s;t be imputed to the imperfection of the charts of which I made u&s;e in reducing the longitude from Batavia, to that place, for there can be no doubt but that the longitude of Batavia is well determined. After we had pa&s;&s;ed the longitude of 307&deg;, the effects of the we&s;terly currents began to be con|&s;iderable; for in three days, our error in longitude was 1&deg; 5&prime;: the velocity of the current kept increa&s;ing, as we pro|ceeded to the we&s;tward, in &s;o much that for five days &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively after we made the land, we were driven to the S. W. or S. W. by W. not le&s;s than twenty leagues a day; and this continued till we were within &s;ixty or &s;eventy leagues of the Cape, where the current &s;et &s;ometimes one way, and &s;ome|times the other, though inclining rather to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P><PB N="784" REF="391"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. March. Friday 15.</NOTE>After the boobies had left us, we &s;aw no more birds till we got nearly abrea&s;t of Madaga&s;car, where, in latitude 27&deg; &frac34; S. we &s;aw an albatro&s;s, and after that time we &s;aw them every day in great numbers, with birds of &s;everal other &s;orts, par|ticularly one about as big as a duck, of a very dark brown colour, with a yellowi&s;h bill. The&s;e birds became more nu|merous as we approached the &s;hore, and as &s;oon as we got into &s;oundings we &s;aw gannets, which we continued to &s;ee as long as we were upon the bank which &s;tretches off An|guillas to the di&s;tance of forty leagues, and extends along the &s;hore to the ea&s;tward, from Cape Fal&s;e, according to &s;ome charts, one hundred and &s;ixty leagues. The real ex|tent of this bank is not exactly known; it is however u&s;eful as a direction to &s;hipping when to haul in, in order to make the land.</P>
<P>While we lay here, the Houghton Indiaman &s;ailed for England, who, during her &s;tay in India, lo&s;t by &s;ickne&s;s be|tween thirty and forty men; and when &s;he left the Cape had many in a helple&s;s condition with the &s;curvy. Other &s;hips &s;uffered in the &s;ame proportion, who had been little more than twelve months ab&s;ent from England; our &s;ufferings therefore were comparatively light, con&s;idering that we had been ab&s;ent near three times as long.</P>
<P>Having lain here to recover the &s;ick, procure &s;tores, and perform &s;everal nece&s;&s;ary operations upon the &s;hip and rig|ging,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April. Saturday 13.</NOTE> till the 13th of April, I then got all the &s;ick on board, &s;everal of whom were &s;till in a dangerous &s;tate, and having taken leave of the Governor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 14.</NOTE> I unmoored the next morning, and got ready to &s;ail.</P>
<P>The Cape of Good Hope has been &s;o often de&s;cribed, and is &s;o well known in Europe, that I &s;hall mention only a few
<PB N="785" REF="392">
particulars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. April.</NOTE> which in other relations are omitted or mi&s;re|pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid to the contrary, no country that we &s;aw during the voyage makes a more for|lorn appearance, or is in reality a more &s;terile de&s;art. The land over the Cape, which con&s;titutes the penin&s;ula formed by Table Bay on the north, and Fal&s;e Bay on the &s;outh, con|&s;i&s;ts of high mountains, altogether naked and de&s;olate: the land behind the&s;e to the ea&s;t, which may be con&s;idered as the i&s;thmus, is a plain of va&s;t extent, con&s;i&s;ting almo&s;t wholly of a light kind of &s;ea &s;and, which produces nothing but heath, and is utterly incapable of cultivation. All the &s;pots that will admit of improvement, which together bear about the &s;ame proportion to the whole as one to one thou|&s;and, are laid out in vineyards, orchards, and kitchen grounds; and mo&s;t of the&s;e little &s;pots lie at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other. There is al&s;o the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, that in the interior parts of this country, that which is ca|pable of cultivation does not bear a greater proportion to that which is incorrigibly barren; for the Dutch told us, that they had &s;ettlements eight and twenty days journey up the country, a di&s;tance equal to at lea&s;t nine hundred miles, from which they bring provi&s;ions to the Cape by land; &s;o that it &s;eems rea&s;onable to conclude that provi&s;ions are not to be had within a le&s;s compa&s;s. While we were at the Cape, a farmer came thither from the country, at the di&s;tance of fifteen days journey, and brought his young children with him. We were &s;urpri&s;ed at this, and a&s;ked him, if it would not have been better to have left them with his next neigh|bour: Neighbour! &s;aid the man, I have no neighbour within le&s;s than five days journey of me. Surely the country mu&s;t be deplorably barren in which tho&s;e who &s;ettle only to rai&s;e
<PB N="786" REF="393">
provi&s;ions for a market,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. April.</NOTE> are di&s;per&s;ed at &s;uch di&s;tances from each other. That the country is every where de&s;titute of wood appears to demon&s;tration; for timber and planks are imported from Batavia, and fuel is almo&s;t as dear as food. We &s;aw no tree, except in plantations near the town, that was &s;ix feet high; and the &s;tems, that were not thicker than a man's thumb, had roots as thick as an arm or a leg, &s;uch is the influence of the winds here to the di&s;advantage of ve|getation, &s;etting the &s;terility of the &s;oil out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The only town which the Dutch have built here is, from its &s;ituation, called Cape Town, and con&s;i&s;ts of about a thou|&s;and hou&s;es, neatly built of brick, and in general whited on the out&s;ide; they are however covered only with thatch, for the violence of the &s;outh ea&s;t winds would render any other roof inconvenient and dangerous. The &s;treets are broad and commodious, all cro&s;&s;ing each other at right angles. In the principal &s;treet there is a canal, on each &s;ide of which is planted a row of oaks, that have flouri&s;hed tolerably well, and yield an agreeable &s;hade: there is a canal al&s;o in one other part of the town, but the &s;lope of the ground in the cour&s;e of both is &s;o great, that they are furni&s;hed with flood|gates, or locks, at intervals of little more than fifty yards.</P>
<P>A much greater proportion of the inhabitants are Dutch in this place than in Batavia; and as the town is &s;upported principally by entertaining &s;trangers, and &s;upplying them with nece&s;&s;aries, every man, to a certain degree, imitates the manners and cu&s;toms of the nation with which he is chiefly concerned. The ladies however are &s;o faithful to the mode of their country, that not one of them will &s;tir without a chaudpied or chau&s;&s;et, which is carried by a &s;ervant that it may be ready to place under her feet whenever &s;he &s;hall &s;it down. This practice is the more remarkable, as very few of
<PB N="787" REF="394">
the&s;e chau&s;&s;ets have &s;ire in them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. April.</NOTE> which indeed the climate renders unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The women in general are very hand&s;ome; they have fine clear &s;kins, and a bloom of colour that indicates a purity of con&s;titution, and high health. They make the be&s;t wives in the world, both as mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of a family and mothers; and there is &s;carcely a hou&s;e that does not &s;warm with children.</P>
<P>The air is &s;alutary in a high degree; &s;o that tho&s;e who bring di&s;ea&s;es hither from Europe, generally recover perfect health in a &s;hort time; but the di&s;ea&s;es that are brought from India are not &s;o certainly cured.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the natural &s;terility of the climate, indu&s;|try has &s;upplied this place with all the nece&s;&s;aries, and even the luxuries of life in the greate&s;t profu&s;ion. The beef and mutton are excellent, though the cattle and &s;heep are natives of the country; the cattle are lighter than ours, more neatly made, and have horns that &s;pread to a much wider extent. The &s;heep are clothed with a &s;ub&s;tance between wool and hair, and have tails of an enormous &s;ize; we &s;aw &s;ome that weighed twelve pounds, and were told that there were many much larger. Good butter is made of the milk of the cows, but the chee&s;e is very much inferior to our own. Here are goats, but they are never eaten, hogs, and a variety of poul|try. Hares are al&s;o found here, exactly like tho&s;e of Europe; antelopes of many kinds, quails of two &s;orts, and bu&s;tards, which are well flavoured, but not juicy. The fields produce European wheat and barley, and the gardens European ve|getables, and fruit of all kinds, be&s;ides plantains, guavas, jambu, and &s;ome other Indian fruits, but the&s;e are not in per|fection; the plantains in particular, are very bad, and the gua|vas no larger than goo&s;eberries. The vineyards al&s;o produce wine of various &s;orts, but not equal to tho&s;e of Europe, ex|cept
<PB N="788" REF="395">
the Con&s;tantia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. April.</NOTE> which is made genuine only at one vineyard, about ten miles di&s;tant from the town. There is another vineyard near it, where wine is made that is called by the &s;ame name, but it is greatly inferior.</P>
<P>The common method in which &s;trangers live here, is to lodge and board with &s;ome of the inhabitants, many of who&s;e hou&s;es are always open for their reception: the rates are from five &s;hillings to two &s;hillings a day, for which all nece&s;&s;aries are found. Coaches may be hired at four and twenty &s;hillings a day, and hor&s;es at &s;ix &s;hillings; but the country affords very little temptation to u&s;e them. There are no public entertainments; and tho&s;e that are private, to which &s;trangers of the rank of Gentlemen are always ad|mitted, were &s;u&s;pended while we were there by the break|ing out of the mea&s;les.</P>
<P>At the farther end of the High-&s;treet, the Company have a garden, which is about two thirds of an Engli&s;h mile long; the whole is divided by walks that inter&s;ect each other at right angles, and are planted with oaks that are clipt into wall hedges, except in the center walk, where they are &s;uf|fered to grow to their full &s;ize, and afford an agreeable &s;hade, which is the more welcome, as, except the planta|tions by the &s;ides of the two canals, there is not a &s;ingle tree that would &s;erve even for a &s;hepherd's bu&s;h, within many miles of the town. The greater part of this garden is kit|chen ground; but two &s;mall &s;quares are allotted to botani|cal plants, which did not appear to be &s;o numerous by one half as they were when Oldenland wrote his catalogue. At the farther end of the garden is a menagerie, in which there are many birds and bea&s;ts that are never &s;een in Europe; particularly a bea&s;t called by the Hottentots <HI>Coe Doe,</HI> which is as large as a hor&s;e, and has the fine &s;piral horns which
<PB N="789" REF="396">
are &s;ometimes &s;een in private and public collections of curi|o&s;ities.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. April.</NOTE></P>
<P>Of the natives of this country, we could learn but little except from report; for there were none of their habitations, where alone they retain their original cu&s;toms, within le&s;s than four days journey from the town; tho&s;e that we &s;aw at the Cape were all &s;ervants to Dutch farmers, who&s;e cattle they take care of, and are employed in other drudgery of the meane&s;t kind. The&s;e are in general of a &s;lim make, and rather lean than plump, but remarkably &s;trong, nimble, and active. Their &s;ize is nearly the &s;ame with that of Europeans, and we &s;aw &s;ome that were &s;ix feet high: their eyes are dull and without expre&s;&s;ion: their &s;kins are of the colour of &s;oot, but that is in a great mea&s;ure cau&s;ed by the dirt, which is &s;o wrought into the grain that it cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed from complexion; for I believe they never wa&s;h any part of their bodies. Their hair curls &s;trongly, not like a negroe's, but falls in ringlets about &s;even or eight inches long. Their clothing con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;kin, generally that of a &s;heep, thrown over their &s;houlders; be&s;ides which, the men wear a &s;mall pouch in the middle of the wai&s;t, and the women, a broad leather flap, both which hang from a girdle or belt that is adorned with beads and &s;mall pieces of copper. Both men and women wear necklaces, and &s;ometimes bracelets, of beads; and the women wear rings of hard leather round their ancles, to defend them from the thorns, with which their country every where abounds: &s;ome of them have a &s;andal, made of wood or bark; but the greater part of them are un&s;hod.</P>
<P>To a European, their language appears to be &s;carcely arti|culate; be&s;ides which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a very remark|able &s;ingularity. At very frequent intervals, while they are
<PB N="790" REF="397">
&s;peaking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. April.</NOTE> they cluck with the tongue again&s;t the roof of the mouth: the&s;e clucks do not appear to have any meaning, but rather to divide what they &s;ay into &s;entences. Mo&s;t of the&s;e Hottentots &s;peak Dutch, without any peculiarity of pronunciation.</P>
<P>They are all mode&s;t, even to &s;heepi&s;hne&s;s; for it was not without the greate&s;t difficulty that we could per&s;uade any of them to dance, or even to &s;peak in their own language to each other, in our pre&s;ence. We did however both &s;ee them dance, and hear them &s;ing; their dances are by turns active and &s;luggi&s;h to exce&s;s; &s;ometimes con&s;i&s;ting of quick and violent motions, with &s;trange di&s;tortions of the body, and unnatural leaps backwards and forwards, with the legs cro&s;|&s;ing each other; and being &s;ometimes &s;o &s;piritle&s;s that the dancer only &s;trikes the ground fir&s;t with one foot and then with the other, neither changing place nor moving any other part of his body: the &s;ongs al&s;o are alternately to quick and &s;low movements, in the &s;ame extremes as the dance.</P>
<P>We made many enquiries concerning the&s;e people of the Dutch, and the following particulars are related upon the credit of their report:</P>
<P>Within the boundaries of the Dutch &s;ettlements there are &s;everal nations of the&s;e people, who very much differ from each other in their cu&s;toms and manner of life: all how|ever are friendly and peaceable, except one clan that is &s;et|tled to the ea&s;tward, which the Dutch call <HI>Bo&s;ch men,</HI> and the&s;e live entirely by plunder, or rather by theft; for they never attack their neighbours openly, but &s;teal the cattle privately in the night. They are armed however to defend them|&s;elves, if they happen to be detected, with lances or a&s;&s;agays, and arrows, which they know how to poi&s;on by various ways, &s;ome with the juice of herbs, and &s;ome with the ve|nom
<PB N="791" REF="398">
of the &s;erpent called <HI>Cobra di Capelo</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. April.</NOTE> in the hands of the&s;e people a &s;tone al&s;o is a very formidable weapon, for they can throw it with &s;uch force and exactne&s;s as repeatedly to hit a dollar at the di&s;tance of a hundred paces. As a defence again&s;t the&s;e freebooters, the other Indians train up bulls, which they place round their towns in the night, and which, upon the approach of either man or bea&s;t, will a&s;&s;emble and oppo&s;e them, till they hear the voice of their ma&s;ters encouraging them to fight, or calling them off, which they obey with the &s;ame docility as a dog.</P>
<P>Some nations have the art of melting and preparing cop|per, which is found among them, probably native; and of this they make broad plates, which they wear as ornaments upon their foreheads. Some of them al&s;o know how to harden bits of iron, which they procure from the Dutch, and form into knives, &s;o as to give them a temper &s;uperior to that of any they can buy.</P>
<P>The Chiefs, many of whom are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of very nume|rous herds of cattle, are generally clad in the &s;kins of lions, tygers, or zebras, to which they add fringes, and other orna|ments in a very good ta&s;te. Both &s;exes frequently anoint the body with grea&s;e, but never u&s;e any that is rancid or foetid, if fre&s;h can be had. Mutton &s;uet and butter are generally u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e; butter is perferred, which they make by &s;haking the milk in a bag made of the &s;kin of &s;ome bea&s;t.</P>
<P>We were told that the prie&s;t certainly gives the nuptial benediction by &s;prinkling the bride and bridegroom with his urine. But the Dutch univer&s;ally declared that the women never wrapped the entrails of &s;heep round their legs, as they have been &s;aid to do, and afterwards make them part of their food. Semica&s;tration was al&s;o ab&s;olutely denied to be
<PB N="792" REF="399">
general;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. April.</NOTE> but it was acknowledged that &s;ome among the par|ticular nation which knew how to melt copper had &s;uffered that operation, who were &s;aid to be the be&s;t warriors, and particularly to excel in the art of throwing &s;tones.</P>
<P>We were very de&s;irous to determine the great que&s;tion among natural hi&s;torians, whether the women of this coun|try have or have not that fle&s;hy flap or apron which has been called the <HI>Sinus pudoris,</HI> and what we learnt I &s;hall relate. Many of the Dutch and Malays, who &s;aid they had received favours from Hottentots women, po&s;itively denied its exi&s;t|ence; but a phy&s;ician of the place declared that he had cured many hundreds of venereal complaints, and never &s;aw one without two fle&s;hy, or rather &s;kinny appendages, pro|ceeding from the upper part of the <HI>Labia,</HI> in appearance &s;omewhat re&s;embling the teats of a cow, but flat; they hung down, he &s;aid, before the <HI>Pudendum,</HI> and were in different &s;ubjects of different lengths, in &s;ome not more than half an inch, in others three or four inches: the&s;e he imagined to be what &s;ome writers have exaggerated into a flap, or apron, hanging down from the bottom of the abdomen, of &s;ufficient extent to render an artificial covering of the neighbouring parts unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Thus much for the country, its productions, and inhabitants. The bay is large, &s;afe, and commodious; it lies open indeed to the north we&s;t winds, but they &s;eldom blow hard; yet as they &s;ometimes &s;end in a great &s;ea, the &s;hips moor N. E. and S. W. &s;o as to have an open haw&s;er with north we&s;t winds: the &s;outh ea&s;t winds blow frequently with great violence, but as this direction is right out of the bay, they are not dangerous. Near the town a wharf of wood is run out to a proper di&s;tance for the convenience of landing and &s;hipping goods. To this wharf water is conveyed in pipes, from which
<PB N="793" REF="400">
&s;everal boats may fill water at the &s;ame time;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. April.</NOTE> and &s;everal large boats or hoys are kept by the Company to carry &s;tores and provi&s;ions to and from the &s;hipping in the harbour. The bay is defended by a &s;quare fort, &s;ituated clo&s;e to the beach on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the town, and by &s;everal outworks and batteries extending along the &s;hore, as well on this &s;ide of the town as the other; but they are &s;o &s;ituated as to be cannonaded by &s;hipping, and are in a manner defencele&s;s again&s;t an enemy of any force by land. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of eight hundred regular troops, be&s;ides militia of the coun|try, in which is comprehended every man able to bear arms. They have contrivances to alarm the whole country by &s;ig|nals in a very &s;hort time, and the militia is then to repair immediately to the town.</P>
<P>The French at Mauritius are &s;upplied from this place with &s;alted beef, bi&s;cuit, flour, and wine: the provi&s;ions for which the French contracted this year were 500,000 lb. weight of &s;alt beef, 400,000 lb. of flour, 400,000 lb. of bi&s;|cuit, and 1,200 leagers of wine.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 14th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 14.</NOTE> we weighed and &s;tood out of the bay; and at five in the evening anchored under Penquin, or Robin I&s;land: we lay here all night, and as I could not &s;ail in the morning for want of wind, I &s;ent a boat to the i&s;land for a few trifling articles which we had forgot to take in at the Cape. But as &s;oon as the boat came near the &s;hore, the Dutch hailed her, and warned the people not to land at their peril, bringing down at the &s;ame time &s;ix men armed with mu&s;quets, who paraded upon the beach. The officer who commanded the boat not thinking it worth while to ri&s;k the lives of the people on board for the &s;ake of a few cabbages, which were all we wanted, returned to the &s;hip. At fir&s;t we were at a lo&s;s to account for our repul&s;e, but we
<PB N="794" REF="401">
afterwards recollected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. April. Sunday 14.</NOTE> that to this i&s;land the Dutch at the Cape bani&s;h &s;uch criminals as are not thought worthy of death, for a certain number of years, proportioned to the offence; and employ them as &s;laves in digging lime-&s;tone, which though &s;carce upon the continent is plenty here: and that a Dani&s;h &s;hip, which by &s;ickne&s;s had lo&s;t great part of her crew, and had been refu&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance at the Cape, came down to this i&s;land, and &s;ending her boat a&s;hore, &s;ecured the guard, and took on board as many of the criminals as &s;he thought proper to navigate her home: we concluded there|fore that the Dutch, to prevent the re&s;cue of their criminals in time to come, had given order to their people here to &s;uffer no boat of any foreign nation to come a&s;hore.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 25.</NOTE>On the 25th, at three o'clock in the afternoon, we weighed, with a light breeze at S. E. and put to &s;ea. About an hour afterwards, we lo&s;t our Ma&s;ter, Mr. Robert Mollineux, a young man of good parts, but unhappily given up to intem|perance, which brought on di&s;orders that put an end to his life.</P>
<P>We proceeded in our voyage homeward without any re|markable incident;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 29.</NOTE> and in the morning of the 29th, we cro&s;&s;ed our fir&s;t meridian, having circumnavigated the globe in the direction from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and con&s;equently lo&s;t a day, for which we made an allowance at Batavia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">May. Wedne&s;. 1.</NOTE>At day-break, on the 1&s;t of May, we &s;aw the i&s;land of St. Helena; and at noon, we anchored in the road before James's fort.</P>
<P>We &s;taid here till the 4th, to refre&s;h, and Mr. Banks im|proved the time in making the complete circuit of the i&s;land, and vi&s;iting the mo&s;t remarkable places upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="795" REF="402">It is &s;ituated as it were in the middle of the va&s;t Atlantic ocean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. May. Wedne&s;. 1.</NOTE> being four hundred leagues di&s;tant from the coa&s;t of Africa, and &s;ix hundred from that of America. It is the &s;ummit of an immen&s;e mountain ri&s;ing out of the &s;ea, which, at a little di&s;tance all round it, is of an unfathomable depth, and is no more than twelve leagues long, and &s;ix broad.</P>
<P>The &s;eat of volcanoes has, without exception, been found to be the highe&s;t part of the countries in which they are found. Aetna and Ve&s;uvius have no land higher than them|&s;elves, in their neighbourhood; Hecla is the highe&s;t hill in Iceland; volcanoes are frequent in the highe&s;t part of the Andes in South America; and the pike of Teneriffe is known to be the covering of &s;ubterraneous fire: the&s;e are &s;till burn|ing, but there are innumerable other mountains which bear evident marks of fire that is now extinct, and has been &s;o from the time of our earlie&s;t traditions: among the&s;e is Saint Helena, where the inequalities of the ground, in its exter|nal &s;urface, are manife&s;tly the effect of the &s;inking of the earth, for the oppo&s;ite ridges, though &s;eparated always by deep, and &s;ometimes by broad vallies, are exactly &s;imilar both in appearance and direction; and that the &s;inking of the earth in the&s;e parts, was cau&s;ed by &s;ubterraneous fire, is equally manife&s;t from the &s;tones, for &s;ome of them, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e in the bottom of the vallies, are burnt almo&s;t to a cinder: in &s;ome there are &s;mall bubbles, like tho&s;e that are &s;een in gla&s;s which has been urged almo&s;t to fu&s;ion, and &s;ome, though at fir&s;t &s;ight they do not appear to have been expo&s;ed to the action of great heat, will be found, upon a clo&s;er in&s;pection, to contain &s;mall pieces of extraneous bo|dies, particularly mundick, which have yielded to the power of fire, though it was not &s;ufficient to alter the appearance of the &s;tone which contained them.</P>
<P><PB N="796" REF="403"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. May. Wedne&s;. 1.</NOTE>It appeared, as we approached it on the windward &s;ide, like a rude heap of rocks, bounded by precipices of amazing height, and con&s;i&s;ting of a kind of half friable &s;tone, which &s;hows not the lea&s;t &s;ign of vegetation; nor is it more pro|mi&s;ing upon a nearer view: in &s;ailing along the &s;hore, we came &s;o near the huge cliffs, that they &s;eemed to over-hang the &s;hip, and the tremendous effect of their giving way, made us almo&s;t fear the event: at length we opened a valley, called Chappel Valley, which re&s;embles a large trench; and in this valley we di&s;covered the town. The bottom of it is &s;lightly covered with herbage, but the &s;ides are as naked as the cliffs that are next the &s;ea. Such is the fir&s;t appearance of the i&s;land in its pre&s;ent cultivated &s;tate, and the fir&s;t hills mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed before the vallies look green, or the country di&s;plays any other marks of fertility.</P>
<P>The town &s;tands ju&s;t by the &s;ea &s;ide, and the far greater part of the hou&s;es are ill built; the church, which originally was a mean &s;tructure, is in ruins, and the market-hou&s;e is nearly in the &s;ame condition.</P>
<P>The white inhabitants are all Engli&s;h, who, as they are not permitted by the Ea&s;t India Company, to whom the i&s;land belongs, to carry on any trade or commerce on their own account, &s;ub&s;i&s;t wholly by &s;upplying &s;uch &s;hips as touch at the place with refre&s;hments, which, however, they do not provide in proportion to the fertility of the &s;oil, and the temperament of the climate, which would enable them, by cultivation, to produce all the fruits and vegetables both of Europe and India. This i&s;land indeed, &s;mall as it is, enjoys the different advantages of different climates, for the cab|bage trees which grow upon the highe&s;t ridges, can by no art be cultivated upon the ridges next below, where the red-wood and gum-wood both flouri&s;h, which will not grow
<PB N="797" REF="404">
upon the ridges above,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. May. Wedne&s;. 1.</NOTE> and neither of the three are to be found in the vallies, which, in general, are covered with European plants, and the more common ones of India.</P>
<P>Here are a few hor&s;es, but they are kept only for the &s;addle, &s;o that all labour is performed by &s;laves; nor are they furni&s;hed with any of the various machines which art has invented to facilitate their ta&s;k. The ground is not every where too &s;teep for a cart, and where it is, the wheel|barrow might be u&s;ed with great advantage, yet there is no wheelbarrow in the whole i&s;land; every thing is conveyed from place to place by the &s;laves, and they are not furni&s;hed even with the &s;imple convenience of a porter's knot, but carry their burden upon their heads. They are indeed very nume|rous, and are brought from almo&s;t every part of the world, but they appeared to be a mi&s;erable race, worn out partly by exce&s;&s;ive labour, and partly by ill u&s;age, of which they frequently complained; and I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that in&s;tances of wanton cruelty are much more frequent among my coun|trymen here, than among the Dutch, who are, and perhaps not without rea&s;on, generally reproached with want of hu|manity at Batavia and the Cape.</P>
<P>Among the native products of this i&s;land, which are not numerous, mu&s;t be reckoned ebony, though the trees are now nearly extinct, and are not remembered to have been plenty: pieces of the wood are frequently found in the val|lies, of a fine black colour, and a hardne&s;s almo&s;t equal to iron: the&s;e pieces, however, are always &s;o &s;hort and crooked, that no u&s;e can be made of them. Whether the tree is the &s;ame with that which produces ebony upon the i&s;le of Bour|bon, or the i&s;lands adjacent, is not known, as the French have not yet publi&s;hed any account of it.</P>
<P><PB N="798" REF="405"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. May. Wedne&s;. 1.</NOTE>There are but few in&s;ects in this place, but there is a &s;pe|cies of &s;nail found upon the tops of the highe&s;t ridges, which probably has been there &s;ince the original creation of their kind, at the beginning of the world. It is indeed very dif|ficult to conceive how any thing which was not depo&s;ited here at its creation, or brought hither by the diligence of man, could find its way to a place &s;o &s;evered from the re&s;t of the world, by &s;eas of immen&s;e extent, except the hypothe&s;is that has been mentioned on another occa&s;ion be adopted, and this rock be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been left behind, when a large tract of country, of which it was part, &s;ub&s;ided by &s;ome convul&s;ion of nature, and was &s;wallowed up in the ocean.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 4.</NOTE>At one o'clock in the afternoon, of the 4th of May, we weighed and &s;tood out of the Road, in company with the Portland man of war, and twelve &s;ail of Indiamen.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;ail in company with the fleet, till the 10th in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 10.</NOTE> when, perceiving that we &s;ailed much heavier than any other &s;hip, and thinking it for that rea&s;on probable that the Portland would get home before us, I made the &s;ignal to &s;peak with her, upon which Captain Elliot him|&s;elf came on board, and I delivered to him a letter for the Admiralty, with a box, containing the common log books of the &s;hip, and the journals of &s;ome of the officers. We con|tinued in company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day. 23.</NOTE> however, till the 23d in the morning, and then there was not one of the &s;hips in &s;ight. About one o'clock in the afternoon, died our Fir&s;t Lieutenant Mr. Hicks, and in the evening we committed his body to the &s;ea, with the u&s;ual ceremonies. The di&s;ea&s;e of which he died, was a con&s;umption, and as he was not free from it when we &s;ailed from England, it may truly be &s;aid that he was dying during

the whole voyage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771. May. Friday 24.</NOTE> though his decline was very gradual till we came to Batavia: the next day, I gave Mr. Charles Clerk an order to act as Lieutenant in his room, a young man who was extremely well qualified for that &s;tation.</P>
<P>Our rigging and &s;ails were now become &s;o bad, that &s;ome|thing was giving way every day. We continued our cour&s;e, however, in &s;afety till the 10th of June, when land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.
