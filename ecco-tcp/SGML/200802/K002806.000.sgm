<HEAD>PREFACE to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>IF there is any Thing, in my Writings, that de|&s;erves to be remember'd, They will <HI>live,</HI> with|out Patronage: If They ought to be forgotten, They wou'd <HI>die,</HI> in &s;pite of Protection. So I commit them to the World, un&s;u&s;tain'd by <HI>Dedica|tion.&mdash;</HI>No Patron's Authority can protect a <HI>bad</HI> Work.&mdash;And a <HI>good</HI> one can want no Protection.</P>
<P>I am afraid, we need look no farther, than the <HI>Dedications</HI> of our Poetick Writings, for the Source of that <HI>Neglect,</HI> which the <HI>Art, It&s;elf,</HI> complains of.&mdash;While Poetry pre&s;erv'd its Hone&s;ty, it was con|&s;ider'd with Di&s;tinction; But, when it degenerated into a Traffick, between <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> and <HI>Reward,</HI> it be|came de&s;pis'd, like the Gold of <HI>Utopia,</HI> not by Igno|rance of its Value, but through &s;corn of the U&s;e, It was put to.</P>
<P>Before I &s;peak of the following Tragedy, I am oblig'd to take Notice of another, the fir&s;t Dramatic Sally of my Youth: And which, I &s;hou'd be a&s;ham'd to confe&s;s, I had the Folly to begin and fini&s;h in a Week, but that I have Occa&s;ion, from that Con|fe&s;&s;ion, to hope Pardon of its Faults; and admire the <HI>Engli&s;h Good-nature,</HI> which receiv'd it, with un|de&s;erv'd Indulgence.&mdash;It was written on the &s;ame Subject with <HI>This,</HI> (upon Mr. <HI>Booth's</HI> recom|mending it to my Choice.) It was, al&s;o, acted at the &s;ame Theatre; and is, &s;till, a Living Evidence, again&s;t me, under the Name of <HI>Elfrid;</HI> or, the <HI>Fair Incon&s;tant.</HI></P>
<P>As I knew nothing of the Rules of Writing, the Play was, con&s;equently, an unprun'd Wilderne&s;s of Fancy, with here and there, a Flower, among the Leaves; but without any Fruit, of Judgment.&mdash;I know not how it came to pa&s;s, that <HI>Athelwold,</HI>
<PB REF="4">
even in That Piece, de&s;erv'd &s;ome little Pity: But, I am afraid, I was too Dull a Painter, to hit a Like|ne&s;s for the Ladies.<HI>&mdash;Elfrid</HI> &s;uffer'd more, by <HI>my</HI> ill Conduct, than Her own; and was a lighter <HI>Incon&s;tant,</HI> than the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times have &s;hown her: And, as for <HI>Edgar,</HI> The Monarch came out of <HI>my</HI> Hands, as one of his Succe&s;&s;ors, out of the Arch-Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI>'s; &s;tript of Every Thing that became his Condition, and only a King in his <HI>Title.</HI></P>
<P>I therefore con&s;ider'd my&s;elf as not de&s;erving Par|don, from the Publick, till I had purchas'd it, with &s;omething, <HI>Better,</HI> on the &s;ame Subject.&mdash;This was the Original of <HI>Athelwold.</HI></P>
<P>The New Play has neither Thought, De&s;ign, nor Expre&s;&s;ion, in the lea&s;t, re&s;embling the Old one; And my only Rea&s;on, for troubling the Reader with this little Story, is, becau&s;e, &s;hou'd there be any Thing in the &s;econd Attempt, greatly Preferable to the Fir&s;t, it will be a <HI>Proof,</HI> that Fancy (for, to &s;ay <HI>Genius,</HI> wou'd be making bold, with what is none of my own,) wants the Aid of the Judgment; and &s;hou'd have Regard to the <HI>Rules,</HI> of an Art, which, like Religion, had an Orthodox E&s;tabli&s;hment; but (like that too) has been warp'd, and weaken'd, by my&s;terious Dullne&s;s, and the dry Pride of Commen|tators.</P>
<P>I am unable to execute any Thing in Poetry, if I have <HI>wa&s;ted</HI> the Care, I be&s;tow'd on this Tragedy:&mdash;Nor can I have &s;o unju&s;t an Opinion of the Pub|lick Ta&s;te, (tho I think Nobody will celebrate it, for Poetry,) as not to know, that &s;hou'd there be Merit in <HI>Athelwold,</HI> there are Spirits, in the Nation, who have Influence, and Genero&s;ity, to awaken others, into their Sentiments.&mdash;I &s;ay this, for the &s;ake of the <HI>Stage;</HI> for, as to my&s;elf, the Di&s;tinction of De&s;erving to be <HI>Read,</HI> is all the Advantage I pro|po&s;e from my Writings.</P>
