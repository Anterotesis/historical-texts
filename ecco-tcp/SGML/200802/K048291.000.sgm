<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following OPERA is in&s;cribed to you, from two motives&mdash;Gratitude, and Self|intere&s;t. My be&s;t feelings are indulged by this acknowledgment of the many obligations I owe to you&mdash;and my vanity, I confe&s;s, will derive no incon&s;iderable gratification, from the world being informed, that you have long cla&s;&s;ed me in the re&s;pectable li&s;t of your pri|vate friends.</P>
<P>The &s;cenes of <HI>dramatic fiction,</HI> are not per|haps the be&s;t calculated, to di&s;play the &s;incerity of per&s;onal regard;&mdash;but my attachment is not the novelty of a day, and depends not there|fore on the form of a public offering.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
The WOODMAN indeed, has, on this oc|ca&s;ion, &s;ome &s;ylvan preten&s;ions of his own: doing, "Suit, and Service," in that antient <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HAINAULT FOREST, in ESSEX.</NOTE>FOREST, over which you exerci&s;e a joint juri&s;diction, he may be allowed, at lea&s;t, a feudal claim to your protection: I &s;hould pay but an ill compliment to your cla&s;&s;ical ta&s;te, which I admire, to &s;uppo&s;e he will be the le&s;s wel|come, becau&s;e he approaches you in the un|affected garb of <HI>Pa&s;toral Simplicity.</HI></P>

<P>The following Statement, proceded the Book of <HI>SONGS,</HI> in the fir&s;t Night's Repre&s;entation; explanatory of the Writer's Views.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the OPERA of THE WOODMAN has been ha&s;tily put together, its defects will but too plainly point out. To excite the admired talents of a MUSICAL FRIEND, &s;uper&s;eded every other con&s;ideration in this undertaking. In an endeavour to &s;ketch his &s;cenes from Nature, if the Writer has failed, the demerit mu&s;t be entirely his own. In this ca&s;e, he can only lament, that the genius of a great LYRIC COMPOSER &s;hould have been mi&s;guided by his inabi|lity&mdash;but the pride of having fir&s;t introduced the mode&s;t merit of Mr. SHIELD to the Theatrical World, he mu&s;t &s;till retain!</P>
<P>He was advi&s;ed, to &s;helter him&s;elf under an a&s;&s;umed name, from &s;ome friendly apprehen&s;ions on the &s;core of party pre|judice; but this he thought unnece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;The deci&s;ion of an Engli&s;h Audience, is &s;eldom regulated by unworthy mo|tives; and per&s;onal re&s;entment is &s;o invariably di&s;claimed by candid Critici&s;m, that to deprecate it on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion, would degrade, even the humility of a DRAMATIC AUTHOR!</P>
<P><HI>To the friendly and liberal attention of</HI> Mr. HARRIS, <HI>and the zealous exertions of all the</HI> PERFORMERS, <HI>the</HI> AUTHOR <HI>feels him&s;elf much indebted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>From a combination of the mo&s;t effective powers of the Theatre, the</HI> WOODMAN <HI>derived, that correct, and animated Performance, which &s;ecured to the Piece &s;o flattering a reception.</HI></P>
<P>&dtristar; <HI>The words adapted to two or three old</HI> AIRS, <HI>unavoidably partake of a bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, irregular mea&s;ure.</HI></P>
