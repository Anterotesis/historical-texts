<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>TO &s;uch tri&s;ling works as novels are generally e&s;teemed, a preface may probably be deemed &s;uperfluous. For which rea&s;on I &s;hall be&s;tow but a few lines on this, and they &s;hall only tend to obviate the remarks that may po&s;&s;ibly be made upon the conduct of the Story.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay I attempted in this &s;pecies of writing, I acknow|ledged "my deficiency in the prin|cipal article of &s;uch compo&s;itions, namely invention <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to the Delicate Di&s;tre&s;s.</NOTE>." The creative powers of fancy do not increa&s;e with years, being rarely to be met with but in the &s;pring of life. On facts alone, then, my readers mu&s;t depend for the entertainment I wi&s;h them to receive from the following &s;heets; as the utmo&s;t merit they can pretend to, is, that the characters as well as the narrative, are drawn from the foun|tain of reality, tho' the &s;tream, by wandering from one country to an|other may have acquired &s;ome adven|titious
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
particles, as well as have lo&s;t &s;ome portion of its original peculiarity.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t uncommon character in the following work, is that of Mr. Evelyn; but I aver that I had the plea&s;ure of being intimately acquainted with the per&s;on from whom the por|trait is exactly copied, when he had reached his fiftieth year; and even at that period of his life, his roman|tic pa&s;&s;ion remained unabated &s;till, tho' the object of it had been no more, for &s;everal years; and dead to him a con&s;iderable time before.</P>
<P>From the favourable reception my former writings of this kind, have been honoured with, I pre&s;ume now, once more, tho' with extreme timi|dity, to &s;olicit the indulgence of the public to this further attempt, and am, with the &s;incere&s;t re&s;pect, its much obliged and mo&s;t grateful humble &s;ervant,</P>

<P>IF I was not a &s;lave to my promi&s;e, I &s;hould not write to you, at pre&s;ent, as I find my&s;elf utterly incapable of ex|pre&s;&s;ing the mixed &s;en&s;ation of my mind.&mdash;I have often complained of the inade|quatene&s;s of language, but never felt it more &s;trongly, than now; the mo&s;t co|pious that I am acquainted with, could by no means afford you even an idea of
<PB N="2" REF="6">
the different reflections that have pro|gre&s;&s;ively given place to each other, in the &s;pace of eight and forty hours.</P>
<P>I am provoked at this natural incapa|city of conveying my &s;entiments to you; words are but a cloak, or rather a clog, to our ideas; there &s;hould be no curtain before the hearts of friends; and the longing I have ever felt for an intuitive conver&s;e, is to me a &s;trong argument for a future &s;tate&mdash;What &s;ays my &s;ceptical friend to this opinion?&mdash;Don't be alarmed, I am not going to &s;ermonize&mdash;but what is almo&s;t as dull, to narrate.</P>
<P>By the carele&s;ne&s;s or ignorance of my po&s;tilion, who drove me at lea&s;t a dozen miles out of my road, over Sali&s;|bury Plain, it was near midnight be|fore I reached this place.&mdash;You, who are thoroughly acquainted with the na|tural warmth of my temper, and know
<PB N="3" REF="7">
how impatient I have been to embrace a favourite &s;i&s;ter, after an ab&s;ence of twelve years, may judge of my anxiety&mdash;but there was no remedy, and I &s;trove to amu&s;e the irk&s;ome tediou&s;ne&s;s of my journey, by endeavouring to trace in my imagination, the growing beauties of my Emma's features, from ten years old, when I la&s;t &s;aw the little darling of our hou&s;e, to their meridian charms, at twenty-two.</P>
<P>At length we reached the gates of this noble edifice, and had the plea&s;ure to find the family not retired to re&s;t, by perceiving lights in the hall.&mdash;I en|quired for Sir James De&s;mond, as I was determined not to announce my&s;elf, and I thought it rather too late for an un|known vi&s;itor, to demand an interview with his lady&mdash;I was &s;hewn into a &s;a|loon, from whence the company had retired after &s;upper; and from an ad|jacent
<PB N="4" REF="8">
apartment, I heard a confu&s;ed &s;ound of voices, intermixed, with the dete&s;table noi&s;e of a dice-box.</P>
<P>In a few minutes all was hu&s;hed, and a man, whom I believed to be an upper &s;ervant, was &s;ent to reconnoitre my per&s;on, and enquire my name and bu&s;ine&s;s. I told him I &s;hould not re|veal either, but to his ma&s;ter. He &s;miled, as it now &s;eems, at my ignorance, and withdrew. In about ten minutes, which &s;eemed as many hours to me, Sir James entered, with an air compounded of <HI>fierte,</HI> and timidity. I pre&s;ented my&s;elf with the be&s;t grace I po&s;&s;ibly could, and on mentioning my name, was acco&s;ted with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s, by my brother-in-law.</P>
<P>On my expre&s;&s;ing my impatience to &s;ee my &s;i&s;ter, he &s;aid he was pretty cer|tain
<PB N="5" REF="9">
that &s;he was not gone to bed, and offered to conduct me to her apartment. I declined his offer till a &s;tranger was announced to her; for I wi&s;hed to &s;ur|pri&s;e, not alarm her. A &s;ervant was then &s;ent to let her lady&s;hip know that there was a gentleman from London, who de&s;ired to pay his re&s;pects to her.&mdash;We followed the &s;ervant to her dre&s;&s;ing-room door; &s;he was &s;itting leaning on her elbow, and &s;eemed lo&s;t in thought; the delivering of the me&s;&s;age rou&s;ed her from her reverie, &s;he &s;tarted up, and &s;aid who can it be, at this late hour? I flew and caught her in my arms, crying out, 'tis I, 'tis Charles! &s;he pre&s;&s;ed me to her bo&s;om, &s;oftly ex|claimed, my brother! and almo&s;t fainted in my arms.</P>
<P>I will not pretend to de&s;cribe my &s;en|&s;ation, for the rea&s;ons given in the be|ginning of this letter, but I am certain,
<PB N="6" REF="10">
I never felt &s;uch unimpa&s;&s;ioned tender|ne&s;s before.&mdash;Sir James, who was not much affected with our interview, left us, to go and order &s;ome refre&s;hment for me; tho' in truth I needed none, my mind being &s;o perfectly delighted with beholding my beloved &s;i&s;ter, whom I had ever thought on with all a father's fondne&s;s, that I had no lei&s;ure to attend to the calls of appetite.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked her a thou&s;and que&s;tions, without waiting for her an&s;wer, except to one; the number of her children&mdash;&s;he replied, I have but one&mdash;it is the image of our mother, and named after her.&mdash;Come, Charles, and let me &s;hew you my lovely Fanny.&mdash;She led me to the nur&s;ery, where I beheld a little &s;leeping angel, of about two years old.&mdash;As we cro&s;&s;ed the &s;tair-ca&s;e, I again heard the dice-box rattle&mdash;Sir James is fond of play, I fancy, Emma, &s;aid I&mdash;She affected
<PB N="7" REF="11">
not to hear my que&s;tion, and did not an&s;wer it.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and di&s;agreeable images ru&s;hed on my imagination, in that in&s;tant, I cru&s;hed their growth, and talked of India, of my other &s;i&s;ters, Lucy, and Mrs. Selwyn, and of you al&s;o, till we were &s;ummoned to the &s;aloon, where &s;upper was prepared for me.</P>
<P>I there met three gentlemen with Sir James, among&s;t whom was the per&s;on I had mi&s;taken for a &s;ervant. When he was pre&s;ented to me, I made my apology, which he received with great good humour, and congratulated Lady De&s;mond on my arrival, with &s;uch ap|parent &s;incerity, that I have taken a liking to this new acquaintance, who&s;e name is Sewell.&mdash;</P>
<P>We &s;pent a couple of hours, mo&s;t agreeably, my &s;i&s;ter became quite chear|ful,
<PB N="8" REF="12">
Sir James and &s;he &s;ung two or three &s;weet duettos, and we all retired to re&s;t, about three o'clock, in the mo&s;t per|fect harmony, and at this happy cri&s;is I will leave you, having run my letter into too great a length, though I have a thou&s;and things more to &s;ay to you; but I have quite as many to &s;ay to Emma, and &s;o, Sir, you mu&s;t, as in duty bound, give place to your betters; as you have gallantry enough, I hope, to agree with me, that all amiable women are &s;o.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHARLES EVELYN, TO WILLIAM STANLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Delville.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU know what an inve&s;tigator of human nature I am, and yet here have I been, four whole days, and as many nights, under the &s;ame roof with Sir James De&s;mond, and cannot form any fixed idea of his character! one hour, tender and polite to his wife, fond of his lovely child, and ea&s;y in his manners to all around him.&mdash;The next, cold, di&s;trait, nay peevi&s;h to my &s;i&s;ter,
<PB N="10" REF="14">
in&s;en&s;ible to the carre&s;&s;es of his little girl, inattentive and indifferent to his gue&s;ts!&mdash;help me Stanley, to account for &s;uch an oppo&s;ition of qualities, and incon&s;i&s;tency of demeanour, in the &s;ame individual.</P>
<P>Too plainly I perceive that Emma is not happy, yet &s;he adores her hu&s;band, and when &s;he &s;peaks of him, her tongue grows wanton in his prai&s;e; at his ap|proach, her eyes &s;parkle with delight, but lo&s;e their lu&s;tre when his counte|nance changes, as it &s;ometimes does, from gay to grave. The variety of ex|pre&s;&s;ion that Emma's Cameleon-like features receive from her Proteus, &s;erve but to heighten her beauty.&mdash;I &s;hould think that nothing could be more in|tere&s;ting than her &s;prightly glance, if I had not &s;een her downca&s;t eye.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="15">
Why, Stanley, do all women affect to charm us by levity, when our affections are much more liable to be attracted by an appearance of &s;en&s;ibility? However, it is not the &s;emblance, but the reality that can plea&s;e, as I have very lately experienced.&mdash;Where it is only a&s;&s;umed, it is ea&s;ily detected; and when the paint is wa&s;hed off, the complexion looks the wor&s;e, for having worn it&mdash;affectation in women, and hypocri&s;y in men, are equally dete&s;table.</P>
<P>I have very unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions, tho' I hope they are not well founded, that Sir James De&s;mond's ruling pa&s;&s;ion is the love of play. Men addicted to this vice, of all others, &s;hou'd never marry; it ab&s;orbs every generous affec|tion of the human heart. The drunkard has intervals of &s;obriety, and in tho&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="16">
may be capable of friend&s;hip and of fondne&s;s.&mdash;The choleric man is not al|ways in a pa&s;&s;ion, and is even pro|verbially good natured and humane; &s;orry for, and ready to atone, the evil his &s;hort lived frenzy may have cau&s;ed.&mdash;Even the libertine, tho' he may cea&s;e to love, mo&s;t generally e&s;teems a virtu|ous wife; and if not a de&s;picable wretch, indeed, endeavours to compen&s;ate for his want of fondne&s;s, by genero&s;ity and politene&s;s towards her.</P>
<P>But let a man be once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a pa&s;&s;ion for gaming, he becomes inca|pable of honour or affection; he wou'd wi&s;h to win money from his deare&s;t friend, tho' he knew that friend mu&s;t be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by lo&s;ing it, and wou'd &s;acri|fice the intere&s;t of his tendere&s;t connec|tion, to gratify this &s;ordid vice, which
<PB N="13" REF="17">
like a whirlpool &s;wallows every virtue.&mdash;His mind can never be at peace; his lo&s;&s;es are attended with a permanent regret; his winnings, with but a tran|&s;ient exultation. The con&s;tant conten|tion of his pa&s;&s;ion, de&s;troys his con&s;ti|tution and anticipates old age; he pa&s;&s;es his days and nights with harpies, like him&s;elf; he lives unloved, and dies un|lamented.</P>
<P>I know not how I have been drawn into this long exclamation again&s;t a vice which you hold in as much ab|horrence as I do, but my mind was full of rancour again&s;t it, merely on a &s;uppo&s;ition that it may interfere with the happine&s;s of a beloved &s;i&s;ter&mdash;I have now let out my venom, and &s;hall perhaps be able to throw off that re|&s;erve to Sir James and his a&s;&s;ociates,
<PB N="14" REF="18">
which this mental bile has hitherto been the cau&s;e of.</P>
<P>I find from Emma, that my brother was rather aver&s;e to her marrying Sir James De&s;mond, but that he had &s;uf|fered too much from a di&s;appointed love to inflict &s;uch torments upon her; as &s;he then confe&s;&s;ed to him, and does now to me, that &s;he cou'd not have been happy with any other man&mdash;May her hu&s;band's gratitude reward her predilection&mdash;And, indeed, if my &s;u&s;picion, with regard to his love of play, be groundle&s;s, I doubt not but he will. As I have already &s;aid he &s;eems to love and e&s;teem her, the caprice of his temper may produce &s;ud|den changes in his manner; but I think her beauty and tenderne&s;s mu&s;t &s;ecure his affections.&mdash;I will think no more upon
<PB N="15" REF="19">
this &s;ubject, at pre&s;ent. My mind is in|voluntarily occupied by more &s;elfi&s;h re|flections; but in my next I &s;hall afford you an opportunity of judging for your|&s;elf, by rea&s;oning from facts.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHARLES EVELYN, TO WILLIAM STANLEY.</HEAD>
<P>I PROMISED in my la&s;t, to give you the minute tran&s;actions of this fa|mily; but how impo&s;&s;ible! not only them, but every trace of my pa&s;t life, except thy friend&s;hip, are vani&s;hed from my memory.</P>
<P>My &s;entiments, my pa&s;&s;ions, are en|gro&s;&s;ed by one object,&mdash;my whole &s;oul is hers,&mdash;never was love &s;o violent, nor beauty &s;o in&s;piring, "Since the
<PB N="17" REF="21">
fir&s;t fair that Eden's garden graced,"&mdash;wou'd &s;he were my Eve, and I her Adam! For in this peopled world, there is no doubt, but that &s;he mu&s;t have had as many lovers, as beholders.&mdash;Perhaps &s;ome favoured youth has already touched her gentle heart, and your unhappy friend mu&s;t &s;igh in vain&mdash;jealou&s;y is twin-born with love; but &s;o is hope; and I will hope, while I exi&s;t&mdash;de&s;pair and death to me can be but one.&mdash;</P>
<P>I will &s;trive to methodize my thoughts, a little, and attempt a de&s;cription of this charming woman; though I know it impo&s;&s;ible to give you a ju&s;t idea of her perfections. We were at breakfa&s;t in Lady De&s;mond's dre&s;&s;ing-room, when a &s;ervant announced the arrival of Lady Juliana Harley&mdash;my &s;i&s;ter's eyes &s;parkled with joy at her approach.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="22">
She was dre&s;&s;ed in a light grey ca&s;&s;imere cloth habit, embroidered with black; her hair was turned up under a white ri|ding hat, in which was a black band and feather; &s;ome of her lovely auburn locks had broke from their confinement, and wandered carele&s;sly o'er her &s;nowy neck&mdash;&s;he is a little taller than the middle &s;ize, her complexion dazzlingly fair, the colour in her cheeks &s;o faint, &s;o tran&s;ient, that you can hardly pronounce there is any except when &s;he &s;peaks, or is addre&s;&s;ed; and then we may &s;ay with Donne,
<Q><L>Her pure and eloquent blood</L>
<L>Spoke in her cheeks, and &s;o di&s;tinctly wrought,</L>
<L>That one would almo&s;t &s;ay her body thought.</L></Q>
This circum&s;tance, however, tho' it may, perhaps, le&s;&s;en her beauties, in|crea&s;es
<PB N="19" REF="23">
her charms; for by appearing not to have been any original defect in her complexion, but the ca&s;ual effect of misfortune or ill-health, captivate us thro' &s;ympathy, which is always &s;tronger than the &s;en&s;es. Her eyes dark blue, adorned with long black eye-la&s;hes; her brows of the &s;ame colour; her no&s;e the perfect Grecian; her lips and teeth&mdash;but I &s;hall attempt no more&mdash;A &s;tatue may be de&s;cribed, but not a living Venus&mdash;&s;he &s;eems to be about four and twenty, and has been near two years a widow.</P>
<P>Emma tells me that my elder brother had been propo&s;ed for her, before her marriage with Mr. Harley; but her fa|ther, the Earl of K&mdash;, had already en|tered into a treaty with her late hu&s;|band, and poor Harry was of cour&s;e,
<PB N="20" REF="24">
refu&s;ed&mdash;I grieve now for what he mu&s;t have &s;uffered, at that time; but con|&s;ole my&s;elf with thinking that he would have had a much &s;everer &s;truggle on his leaving life, had he been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch an object. At lea&s;t I &s;trive to per&s;uade my&s;elf that it was happy for him, he was not married to Lady Juliana, as I may hope, at the &s;ame time, that it was very fortunate for me.</P>
<P>This charming woman has promi&s;ed to &s;tay a fortnight with my &s;i&s;ter, and then we are all to go to London, together.&mdash;I will u&s;e all my intere&s;t with Emma, to delay her journey, and detain her lovely gue&s;t for a longer term. If I do not obtain &s;ome little &s;hare in her heart, whil&s;t &s;he remains under the &s;ame roof with me, where I have a thou&s;and op|portunities of marking my attentions,
<PB N="21" REF="25">
without appearing to obtrude them, I mu&s;t de&s;pair of making any impre&s;&s;ion, when &s;he will be &s;urrounded by crouds of admirers, and hurried into all the di&s;&s;ipation of the gay world.</P>
<P>The country, as the poets tell us, is the &s;cene for love; the plea&s;ing objects that &s;urround us, the purene&s;s of the air, but, above all, its &s;tillne&s;s, har|monize the &s;oul, and render it &s;u&s;cep|tible of every &s;oft and tender feeling.&mdash;Noi&s;e is an enemy to all the gentle pa&s;&s;ions, I agree with Sterne, that a lover who was unfortunate enough, to throw down the fire &s;hovel and tongs, when he was going to pro&s;trate him&s;elf at his mi&s;tre&s;s's feet, cou'd have very little hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, from his flurried fair one.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="26">
Silence is rendered vocal, at this moment, by the &s;oft &s;ounds of Lady Juliana's, and my &s;i&s;ter's voices, under my window&mdash;They are going to walk, perhaps,&mdash;I fly, I follow them!</P>

<P>SOME French writer &s;ays, <Q>That there are men, who are &s;uch egoti&s;ts, that rather than not talk of them&s;elves they wou'd even reveal their failings.</Q> Tho&s;e men were never in love, or they wou'd have experienced a much higher delight in talking of the object of their affections, than of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>For my part, I can neither think, talk, or write upon any other &s;ubject than the

charming Juliana&mdash;If you were not a lo|ver, I &s;hou'd fear you wou'd &s;oon grow tired of my corre&s;pondence, but as I know you are capable of all the plea&s;ing weakne&s;&s;es nece&s;&s;arily attendant upon that character, I tru&s;t you will indulge me on my favourite topic.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t, I gave you a faint &s;ketch of lady Juliana's per&s;onal charms, but be|lieve me, Stanley, no pen or pencil can de&s;cribe the winning &s;oftne&s;s, and attrac-tive grace, that accompanies her every look and motion&mdash;I have &s;een many ele|gant women, but &s;he is elegance per&s;o|nified<HI>&mdash;ip&s;a forma.</HI></P>
<P>There is a plaintive &s;weetne&s;s in her voice, that wou'd render the mo&s;t trifling expre&s;&s;ions intere&s;ting; even a blind man, who did not under&s;tand her language, wou'd be enamoured of the &s;ound&mdash;She

<L>So charming left his voice, that he awhile</L>
<L>Thought him &s;till &s;peaking, &s;till &s;tood fixed to hear.</L></Q></P>
<P>Her words upon every &s;ubject on which &s;he conver&s;es, are perfectly well cho&s;en, from whence I conclude &s;he has read the be&s;t authors in our language; &s;he is a perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of the French, and Em|ma &s;ays, plays finely on the harp&s;ichord, but has not been prevailed on &s;ince &s;he came here to afford us this delight. I have never &s;een her laugh, and &s;he &s;ighs oftener, than &s;he &s;miles&mdash;&s;he &s;eems to labour under an habitual melancholy, which gives an additional &s;oftne&s;s both to her looks and manner.&mdash;</P>

Do you know that notwith&s;tanding our friend&s;hip, I &s;hould not be quite ea&s;y at your &s;eeing Lady Juliana, if I was not convinced that Lucy has an unboun|ded power over your affections, and will of cour&s;e be kind enough to her&s;elf, and me, to prevent your becoming my ri|val.

<P>AND now, I &s;uppo&s;e, like your gallant prototype, Mon&s;ieur Romeo, you have totally forgotten your former mi&s;tre&s;s, and are ready to hang, drown, or put an end to your mi&s;erable exi&s;|tence, in any other doleful way, all for the love of your fair Juliet. Alas poor Charles!&mdash;however, I am glad you have
<PB N="30" REF="34">
been laid hold of by this charming re|lict&mdash;Love-making and hay-making are the two mo&s;t delightful rural pa&s;times, that I know of; but it is not requi&s;ite that both &s;hould be done <HI>while the &s;un &s;hines&mdash;</HI>for the fir&s;t is ju&s;t as agree|able by a fire-&s;ide, under a roof, with or without the &s;inging of cage-birds, as in a &s;ummer's evening, under the &s;hade of a beech, to the &s;oft notes of the nightingale,&mdash;For notwith&s;tanding all that you or the poets have &s;aid, in prai&s;e of the country, I will venture to promi&s;e that your fond vows will be ju&s;t as well received by Lady Juliana, at her hou&s;e in Berkeley-&s;quare, as in the mo&s;s-grown woods, or flowering-&s;hrub|bery at Delville&mdash;It is the man, and not the place, that mu&s;t render his pa&s;&s;ion acceptable; for every &s;pot is an Eden, with tho&s;e we love.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="35">
I will allow there is much plea&s;ure, and perhaps &s;ome little advantage too, in being in the &s;ame hou&s;e with the object of our affections, whil&s;t we are endeavouring to in&s;pire a reciprocal one; but that once having taken effect, believe me it is much more for the intere&s;t of the lover to be placed at a little di&s;tance, than too near. The ple&s;aure of expecting his approach, fixes the fair-one's attention to his mo&s;t agreeable qualities, and the flat|tering likene&s;s which her fondne&s;s and &s;elf-love join to draw off the ab&s;ent idol, generally exceeds the merits of the original.</P>

<HEAD>CHARLES EVELYN, TO WILLIAM STANLEY.</HEAD>
<P>UPON my honour you do me wrong, Stanley&mdash;I never loved, or feigned to love Mi&s;s Morton&mdash;I thought her lively, elegant, and &s;en&s;ible, and &s;till think her &s;o, but were every charm &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es augmented beyond the power of numbers to encrea&s;e, my heart could hold no &s;ympathy with hers&mdash;For if &s;he has a heart, it is an unfeeling one&mdash;Do not mi&s;take me, now, by &s;uppo&s;ing that

<P>When I fir&s;t came to England, I &s;aw her often, liked, nay admired, and might perhaps have loved her, had not the worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition broke thro' the cobweb veil of an affected &s;en&s;ibility, and turned my admiration to di&s;gu&s;t&mdash;You may remember, that at the time of my arrival in London, Mi&s;s Morton was on a vi&s;it at my &s;i&s;ter Selwyn's; this cir|cum&s;tance occa&s;ioned our being particu|larly intimate; we &s;pent almo&s;t our whole time together, and whether from any little de&s;ign of rendering her&s;elf agree|able to me, by indulging what you call my foible, or from an affectation of &s;in|gular &s;en&s;ibility, I know not, &s;he u&s;ed to launch forth into &s;uch effu&s;ion of &s;enti|mental tenderne&s;s and genero&s;ity, as ex|ceeded
<PB N="39" REF="43">
even our ea&s;tern ideas of huma|nity.&mdash;I have &s;een her ready to weep for a drowning fly; and my &s;i&s;ter Lucy u&s;ed to &s;ay, Mi&s;s Morton cou'd only be a fit wife, for <HI>The Man of Feeling</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The title of a novel.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It happened one &s;ummer's evening, that we three walked in the park till near du&s;k; as we came down Con&s;titu|tion-Hill, a young woman in a wretched garb, with a pale and emaciated counte|nance, pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;ely by us. Chance, and chance alone, directed my eyes to glance full upon hers; in a moment her face was &s;uffu&s;ed with crim&s;on, &s;he turned her head a&s;ide, quickened her pace, and was almo&s;t in&s;tantly out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;o &s;wift as thought; a ray of recollection beamed upon my mind, and
<PB N="40" REF="44">
brought back to my remembrance the once &s;miling countenance of Nancy We&s;|ton, who&s;e father had been one of the un|der ma&s;ters at Winche&s;ter, at who&s;e hou&s;e I boarded, when I was placed at college there.&mdash;Her appearance &s;poke di&s;tre&s;s<HI>&mdash;&s;aas</HI> adieu, I quitted the ladies, and &s;et out with ha&s;ty &s;trides to overtake and ac|knowledge my former play-fellow, or rather play-thing, for &s;he was &s;ome years younger than my&s;elf, and I had borne her in my arms a thou&s;and times. What convinced me that I was not mi&s;taken in my conjecture with regard to the identity of the per&s;on, was a pretty large mole at the bottom of her left cheek, which u&s;ed to give a thou&s;and namele&s;s graces to her mouth.</P>
<P>I reached the top of the hill without perceiving the object of my pur&s;uit, but upon looking backwards, I &s;aw her lying
<PB N="41" REF="45">
on the ground at &s;ome di&s;tance from the foot-path, with her face covered by her hands&mdash;The little effort which con&s;cious &s;hame had impelled her feeblene&s;s to make, in order to pa&s;s unnoticed by me, had totally exhau&s;ted her la&s;t remains of &s;trength, and perhaps &s;he had &s;aid with Jane Shore&mdash;<Q>Why &s;hou'd I wander, &s;tray farther on, for I can die even here?</Q></P>
<P>I flew directly towards her, and rai&s;ed her almo&s;t lifele&s;s body from the earth&mdash;&s;he could not articulate a &s;ingle word, but the dumb eloquence of flowing tears too plainly &s;poke unutterable woe&mdash;I &s;aw a gentleman pa&s;&s;ing at &s;ome di&s;tance, and called to him for help; as he came near, I entreated him to u&s;e the utmo&s;t expe|dition to fetch a chair to receive a young woman that I feared was dying,&mdash;he &s;aid he was &s;orry my humanity was not
<PB N="42" REF="46">
be&s;towed upon a worthier object, as he &s;uppo&s;ed her to be one of tho&s;e unhappy wretches who nightly-infe&s;t the park; but &s;he &s;hou'd not however peri&s;h for want of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and at that moment &s;et forward to call a chair, in which, at his return I placed her, and de&s;ired the men to carry her gently to the fir&s;t apothecary's &s;hop in Picadilly, whither I attended her.</P>
<P>Every medicinal aid that is u&s;ually given to fainting per&s;ons was admini&s;|tered to her, and &s;he revived a little&mdash;the humane apothecary &s;aid &s;he wanted food more than phy&s;ic, and made her eat a little bread, and drink &s;ome wine and water. I then de&s;ired her to direct the chairmen to her home, and &s;aid I wou'd follow her thither&mdash;&s;he rai&s;ed her languid eyes, and &s;aid, in a low, and &s;carcely ar|ticulate voice, <HI>I have no home.</HI> I then reque&s;ted the apothecary to provide a
<PB N="43" REF="47">
lodging for her, near him, and to attend her both as a phy&s;ician and a friend, promi&s;ing to be an&s;werable for any ex|pence and trouble that might be incurred upon her account; and as a counter &s;e|curity to which engagement, left a bill for fifty pounds in his hands to be &s;ettled for at &s;ome future day.</P>
<P>The poor unhappy girl then fell on her knees before me, pouring out the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude for my kindne&s;s. I intreated her to compo&s;e her &s;hattered &s;pirits for the pre&s;ent, and to rely upon my friend&s;hip not to de&s;ert her, let her faults or mis|fortunes be of what nature &s;oever they might. So leaving my addre&s;s with her, that &s;he might know where to apply, I returned to Mrs. Selwyn's, in order to account for my abrupt manner of quitting Mi&s;s Morton and Lucy.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="48">
When I had told my tale, I expected to &s;ee the bewitching tear of pity &s;tand in Mi&s;s Morton's eye:&mdash;when to my amazement, a &s;ettled gloom loured on her brow, and indignation &s;parkled from her eyes,&mdash;&s;he continued &s;ilent, till I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to her and Lucy, reque&s;ting them to &s;pare me &s;ome part of their ward-robe, to &s;upply the imme|diate nece&s;&s;ities of the unhappy Nancy We&s;ton, till there cou'd be &s;ome pro|cured, more &s;uited to her humble &s;ta|tion.&mdash;</P>
<P>No words can de&s;cribe the rage with which &s;he told me, that &s;he was a&s;to|ni&s;hed, both at my in&s;olence and mean|ne&s;s, in expecting that &s;he wou'd &s;uffer any thing &s;he had ever worn to be con|taminated by the per&s;on of a pro&s;titute, for &s;uch &s;he was &s;ure I had known her to be, and if I intended to re&s;tore her to
<PB N="45" REF="49">
her former &s;ituation, &s;he thought it wou'd be but decent to cloath her at my own, rather than at any other per&s;on's expence.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the &s;udden and forcible effect, which both the manner and matter of Mi&s;s Morton's harangue produced on me. Suffice it to &s;ay, that they <HI>un&s;exed</HI> her, even from top to toe;&mdash;and from that hour, I have ever looked upon her mind with dete&s;tation, and her per&s;on with di&s;|gu&s;t.</P>
<P>I have entered into this long detail, to acquit my&s;elf of a charge, which by the generality of the world is &s;carcely deemed a vice, but which I con&s;ider as an act of ba&s;ene&s;s, that of engaging the affections of an innocent heart, and then repaying its unmerited tenderne&s;s with

black ingratitude.&mdash;Bani&s;hed be the vile idea from every hone&s;t brea&s;t, and may his couch be ever &s;trewed with thorns, that can for his &s;port, create a pang, in the bo&s;om of un&s;u&s;pecting inno|cence!</P>
<P>Away with the unplea&s;ing &s;ubject, and let it prove to my Stanley, of how much con&s;equence his e&s;teem is to my happine&s;s, when I tell him that it is now three o'clock in the morning, that I have danced from eight in the even|ing (but not with Lady Juliana, &s;he having retired with vi&s;ible dejection to her chamber, on the arrival of &s;ome company,) yet could not lay me down in peace, till I had removed the un|ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion he has hinted, tho' &s;eem|ingly in je&s;t, of my being a faithle&s;s lover, or, in other words a &s;coundrel.&mdash;But tho' at this moment I am very far
<PB N="47" REF="51">
from being, happy either on my own or Emma's account, I have the con&s;ola|tion of thinking that I have not de&s;erved to be wretched, and of knowing that I may boldly &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf your <HI>&s;incere</HI> Friend.</P>

<P>The unexpected meeting with Mr. Evelyn, at fir&s;t a good deal di&s;concerted me, for I am little u&s;ed to &s;eeing &s;tran|gers.

<HEAD>CHARLES EVELYN, TO WILLIAM STANLEY.</HEAD>
<P>O STANLEY, &s;he is gone! fled! and much I fear it is from me &s;he flies.&mdash;</P>
<P>La&s;t night, cur&s;e on all &s;ports and &s;port&s;men! Sir James De&s;mond, propo&s;ed our going out a &s;hooting this morning early; the day was gloomy, and it was near nine o'clock before we determined upon &s;etting out.&mdash;The ladies, as I thought, were not yet ri&s;en&mdash;while our hor&s;es were getting ready I took a turn
<PB N="62" REF="66">
in the garden, and at &s;ome di&s;tance heard the &s;ound of female voices&mdash;I &s;topped to li&s;ten from whence they came, and at that in&s;tant perceived Lady Juliana and my &s;i&s;ter coming towards me, in clo&s;e conference&mdash;they &s;eemed to be en|gaged upon &s;ome very important &s;ubject, and I fancied I heard my name men|tioned&mdash;the moment they beheld me, they turned about, and with a quickened pace &s;hot down another walk&mdash;I &s;aw they wi&s;hed to avoid me, and therefore re|turned directly into the hou&s;e. I joined Sir James and his friends, and we &s;et out together; but I was too much occupied with the &s;cene that had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed before me, to be at all intere&s;ted in their &s;port,&mdash;they rallied me upon my inattention, and wi&s;hed me to return home, as I interrupted their amu&s;ement, without &s;eeming to be my&s;elf amu&s;ed&mdash;I readily accepted my <HI>cong&eacute;,</HI> and clapping &s;purs
<PB N="63" REF="67">
to my hor&s;e, galloped back again with an un&s;peakable anxiety.</P>
<P>I found my &s;i&s;ter alone in the draw|ing room, and in&s;tantly enquired for Lady Juliana&mdash;&s;he replied, with a me|lancholy accent, &s;he has left us, Charles.&mdash;Whither is &s;he gone? and what cou'd be the cau&s;e of &s;uch a &s;udden flight?&mdash;On both the&s;e &s;ubjects I am as igno|rant as you can be. It is impo&s;&s;ible, I cried; but if you ever loved me, Emma, tell me and tell me truly, have I offended Lady Juliana, and is it from my hated &s;ight &s;he flies?&mdash;I am &s;ure &s;he does not hate you, &s;he replied, for her nature is incapable of repaying hatred, <HI>for love.&mdash;</HI>What, then &s;he knows I love her?&mdash;From her di&s;cour&s;e I believe &s;he <HI>fears</HI> you do&mdash;but be compo&s;ed, &s;it down, I beg of you&mdash;Wherefore &s;hou'd &s;he <HI>fear</HI> it? Does &s;he think meanly of me? My
<PB N="64" REF="68">
brother was not thought unworthy her alliance, &s;he wou'd have given her hand to him, but that her father's promi&s;e was engaged to one &s;he never loved,&mdash;but I will know the cau&s;e of her di&s;dain; from her own lips will know it. I rang the bell and ordered my chai&s;e to be got ready in&s;tantly. Emma bur&s;t into tears, and &s;aid, do not render me more unhappy than I am already&mdash;my brother, do not leave me in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Alarmed as all my pa&s;&s;ions were, her gentle accents vibrated upon my heart, and calmed each throbbing pul&s;e.&mdash;I &s;at down by her, took her trembling hand and &s;aid, what does my Emma mean?&mdash;Can I relieve her &s;orrows?&mdash;Her tears flowed more abundantly, and for &s;ome minutes &s;topped her utterance&mdash;at length, turning her head away from me, &s;he &s;aid, yes Charles, thank hea|ven,
<PB N="65" REF="69">
you can; but do not let the pre|&s;ent circum&s;tance le&s;&s;en my hu&s;band in your e&s;teem; no man is perfect, and Sir James has but one fault&mdash;he is too fond of play.&mdash;There is an execution in our hou&s;e this moment for &s;even hun|dred pounds.&mdash;I wou'd have joined with my hu&s;band to rai&s;e the money, by re|linqui&s;hing my jointure&mdash;but he wou'd not li&s;ten to the propo&s;al, declaring he wou'd peri&s;h in a gaol, rather than in|jure me, or our dear little Fanny.&mdash;He is, indeed, my brother, the tendere&s;t of hu&s;bands, and of fathers.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e particulars Emma, &s;aid I, you certainly are the be&s;t judge, but have I not rea&s;on to re&s;ent Sir James's want of confidence in me? Why did he not prevent this di&s;grace to him&s;elf and family, by acquainting me with his
<PB N="66" REF="70">
nece&s;&s;ities?&mdash;Cou'd he &s;uppo&s;e me mean enough to &s;uffer you to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for any &s;um within my power to rai&s;e?&mdash;Ah, Charles! &s;he replied, catching my hand, the mind that feels its own reproach dreads to expo&s;e it&s;elf to that of others.&mdash;They who have lo&s;t the fear of being contemned, mo&s;t generally de|&s;erve to be &s;o.</P>
<P>I will believe you rea&s;on ju&s;tly, Emma, and wou'd not, if I cou'd, re|fute your argument; but time now pre&s;&s;es.&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible that I can re&s;t till my doom is pronounced by Lady Juliana,&mdash;this night I mu&s;t leave Del|ville, and am at pre&s;ent no otherways pre|pared to extricate you from your irk&s;ome &s;ituation, than by taking the debt upon my&s;elf, if your creditor will accept my &s;ecurity, I am ready to give it; but as
<PB N="67" REF="71">
I am not known to him, he may per|haps object.&mdash;If I cou'd &s;tay but three days longer, it might be more ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed; for from &s;ome hints that have been dropped, in relation to Sir James's circum&s;tances, I drew upon my banker for a thou&s;and pounds, but I cannot expect the bills &s;hou'd be re|turned to me till Friday at the &s;oone&s;t.</P>
<P>It is no matter, &s;he replied, Mr. Sewell will, I doubt not, gladly accept of your &s;ecurity. Is Sewell then your cre|ditor, I exclaimed? Cou'd he lodge an execution in the hou&s;e under who&s;e roof he dwells? I know not how it is, my brother, but I believe the money was originally lo&s;t at play to Mr. Sewell&mdash;Sir James gave him a bond, on which he rai&s;ed the money from his brother, who now exacts the payment in this &s;e|vere manner.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="72">
I fear then, Emma, Sewell is a knave, and joined in mean collu&s;ion with his brother, to di&s;tre&s;s your hu&s;band, who looks upon him as his friend.&mdash;You are deceived, Charles, I am &s;ure he is Sir James's friend, and mine, by his per|petually di&s;&s;uading him from play.&mdash;It may be &s;o; but tell me, Emma, all you know, and all you think of Lady Ju|liana's &s;udden departure, what can it mean?</P>
<P>She replied, I again repeat to you, that I am as ignorant of Lady Juliana's motives for her conduct, as your&s;elf:&mdash;though to all appearance &s;he has been perfectly blamele&s;s through the whole cour&s;e of her life; her actions have always been involved in a &s;ort of my&s;|tery, and &s;eemingly incon&s;i&s;tent to my apprehen&s;ion.&mdash;My &s;i&s;ter Lucy may po&s;&s;ibly be better acquainted with her

&s;entiments than I am, as &s;he was very intimate with her even before her mar|riage. She did not continue in that &s;tate above four months; and tho' I had rea|&s;on to believe &s;he was an unhappy wife, &s;he lamented her hu&s;band's untimely death with &s;uch an extravagance of &s;orrow, as placed her very nearly on a footing with the Malabarian widows; for her health was &s;o much impaired by her grief, that it was thought impo&s;&s;i|ble &s;he cou'd recover; nor have I ever &s;een her chearful &s;ince her hu&s;band died.&mdash;But from the moment &s;he per|ceived your particular attachment, her melancholy was encrea&s;ed, and &s;he has &s;eemed twenty times upon the point of expre&s;&s;ing her unea&s;ine&s;s at your con|&s;tant a&s;&s;iduities. For the&s;e la&s;t three days &s;he appeared to be quite retired within her&s;elf, and I have had &s;o many di&s;agreeable things to engro&s;s my

<P>This morning &s;he &s;ent her woman to let me know that &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;peak with me, and that I &s;hou'd find her in the garden, to which I in&s;tantly repaired. She was &s;eated in the temple by the river's &s;ide, leaning on her arm, and &s;eemed lo&s;t in thought; when I approached her, &s;he &s;tarted from her reverie, and &s;aid&mdash;The ill fate that has ever attended me, prevents my &s;taying longer at Delville, or accompanying you to London; I was born to create mi&s;ery, where I wi&s;h to confer happine&s;s, but I will not volunta|rily increa&s;e the baneful influence of that malignant fatality which dwells around me.&mdash;For this rea&s;on only, do I now take a precipitate leave of you, my dear Lady De&s;mond, intreating you not to

mention my departure till I have been gone &s;ome hours.</P>
<P>I, at fir&s;t, proceeded Emma, endeavour|ed to rally her out of her re&s;olution, and told her that &s;he &s;eemed by her phra&s;e to have been &s;tudying judicial a&s;trology; but that I was a greater conjuror than &s;he took me for, and a&s;&s;ured her that I &s;aw no baneful influence, nor malignant fa|tality in her horo&s;cope; but on the con|trary, love, joy, and harmony proceeding from the little twinkling &s;tar that had directed her &s;teps to Delville, from which place I earne&s;tly entreated &s;he wou'd not depart till we all &s;et out together.</P>
<P>I had forced a &s;mile into my counte|nance, while I talked to her, and did not, till I had done &s;peaking, perceive that her eyes were filled with tears&mdash;She turned her face from me, and &s;tepping

It was almo&s;t midnight when he arrived here la&s;t night; pale as a&s;hes, his eyes wild and haggard, and his hair undre&s;s'd. My &s;i&s;ter Selwyn had not been well all day, and was retired to re&s;t.&mdash;The moment he came into the parlour where I was &s;itting, he cried out, Where is &s;he, Lucy? Gone to bed, &s;aid I, think|ing
<PB N="86" REF="90">
he enquired after Mrs. Selwyn.&mdash;Do not torture me, he replied, but tell me where is lady Juliana?</P>
<P>A &s;trange que&s;tion truly, an&s;wered I; &s;urely you have &s;een her long &s;ince I did.&mdash;I &s;poke this in a miff, for I thought he might have fir&s;t enquired his &s;i&s;ter's health, after an ab&s;ence of above a month.&mdash;Quite frantic, he threw him&s;elf at my feet, and &s;aid he wou'd not &s;tir from thence till I informed him where you were; for that Stanley had told him he believed I knew.<HI>&mdash;Mem.</HI> I &s;hall puni&s;h Mr. Stanley pretty hand&s;omely for pretending to gue&s;s at my &s;ecrets. Mr. Selwyn, who was in his library in the next room, compo&s;ing a &s;ermon, for ought I know, alarmed by the noi&s;e this inamorato made, peeped into the par|lour, with his gla&s;&s;es on, and &s;eeing a man at my feet, &s;eemed doubtful whe|ther
<PB N="87" REF="91">
he &s;hould retire or advance, till I intreated him to come in, a&s;&s;uring him it was not a lover, but a lunatic, he beheld in that &s;ituation.&mdash;You are mi&s;taken, Lucy, Charles exclaimed, I am the ten|dere&s;t, fonde&s;t, mo&s;t unhappy lover that ever yet exi&s;ted, and if you have not a mind to drive me to di&s;traction, you will acquaint me where my deity re&s;ides, and let me kneel before the &s;hrine which &s;he inhabits, with pure&s;t adoration.</P>
<P>P&s;ha, very prophane that, &s;aid Mr. Selwyn.&mdash;For Heaven's &s;ake, Charles, &s;aid I, ri&s;e and compo&s;e your&s;elf&mdash;you mu&s;t be very certain that if lady Juliana had entru&s;ted me with any thing &s;he cho&s;e to keep a &s;ecret, I would not violate the tru&s;t by revealing it to you; you can therefore receive no benefit from Mr. Stanley's information. But whatever are her motives for retirement, I hope they
<PB N="88" REF="92">
will not operate long, and that &s;he will be re&s;tored to the &s;ociety of her friends in a few days, or weeks, at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>Days or weeks! exclaimed he,&mdash;you talk of centuries! I tell you, Lucy, I will not re&s;t till I behold her.&mdash;Nay then, &s;aid Mr. Selwyn, I &s;hall wi&s;h you a good night; it will be vain for me to &s;it up any longer, but if you chu&s;e to pa&s;s the night without &s;leep, I will or|der the &s;ervants to mend the fire, bring you fre&s;h candles, and go to bed, for they mu&s;t ri&s;e in the morning. I could not help &s;miling at Mr. Selwyn's literal conception of my brother's expre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Charles &s;eemed much offended with both of us, and ru&s;hed out of the room, with|out even bidding us good night.</P>
<P>Now, madam, what do you think of the mi&s;chief your cruelty, or caprice ra|ther,
<PB N="89" REF="93">
has occa&s;ioned? May I not &s;ay, with Ophelia, <Q>O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!</Q> And have I not a right in common ju&s;tice, to demand the re&s;toration of my brother's &s;en&s;es from your lady&s;hip, or &s;ome other averdupois equivalent for the lo&s;s? In &s;hort, my dear Juliana, if you have any friend&s;hip for me, you will immediately come to London, and make an end of this &s;imple bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;If you cannot like my bro|ther, tell him &s;o, and perhaps the wound which his &s;elf-love mu&s;t receive from your denial, may rou&s;e him to attempt the conque&s;t of an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I am rather &s;urprized at not having &s;een my poor lunatic to-day; my &s;i&s;ter Selwyn is quite grieved about him, and &s;ent this morning to know how he did, and to invite him to dinner&mdash;but the &s;ervant returned with a <HI>non inventus&mdash;</HI>

he had drove out of town&mdash;whither can he have taken his flight? Mr Selwyn thinks he ought to be put under Doctor Monro's care; but I make bold to &s;ay, that you, and only you, can effect his cure.&mdash;Ha&s;ten then, my &s;weet friend, to the relief, both of Charles and</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bath.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NO, Stanley! &s;he is not here, and this place, though througed with numbers of the young and gay, is to me a de&s;art. Yet I confe&s;s there was a probability of meeting, or at lea&s;t hearing of her, in &s;uch a concour&s;e of people of her own rank;&mdash;yet no tidings of her have yet reached me.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="96">
Pardon me, Stanley, if I &s;ay that I can hardly forgive your Lucy&mdash;I will not call her my &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;She certainly knows where Lady Juliana is, and yet is &s;o in-human to conceal it from me.&mdash;Surely you mu&s;t have power &s;ufficient over her to make her reveal the &s;ecret; be a&s;&s;ur|ed, if &s;he refu&s;es to let you know it, &s;he is not worthy of your affection, for I am certain it is impo&s;&s;ible for a woman to deny any thing to the &s;olicitations of the man &s;he loves. This maxim is too frequently proved, to admit of its being doubted; but what a wretch is he who takes advantage of its certainty, to be|tray un&s;u&s;pecting innocence, or to in|volve the being he pretends to love, in mi&s;ery and guilt!</P>
<P>I have been led into this reflection by the un&s;ought confidence of our &s;chool-fellow, Capt. Williams, whom I hap|pened
<PB N="93" REF="97">
to meet with here, and who is a very libertine, and at pre&s;ent engaged in an unworthy attempt on a young lady, his equal in birth, though not in fortune. She has a brother in the army, who is ex|pected daily from Ireland; and the ap|prehen&s;ion of his arrival hurries Wil|liams into the mo&s;t imprudent conduct: &s;o that the young lady will proba|bly lo&s;e her reputation, if her brother &s;hould even come time enough to protect her innocence.</P>
<P>I have expre&s;&s;ed my &s;entiments upon this &s;ubject very fully to him, but he only laughs at what I &s;ay; except when I mention the certainty of the young lady's brother calling him to account for his ill behaviour. This part of the ce|remony, he &s;ays, he does not like, but has a&s;ked me to be his &s;econd, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be involved in &s;uch an adventure.
<PB N="94" REF="98">
But I have declined the honour; for the punctilio &s;hould be &s;hewn in avoiding an offence, not in defending it.</P>
<P>Is it not amazing, that a man &s;hould premeditately ru&s;h on to an action that his heart mu&s;t condemn, even at the ha|zard of his life? Anxious and unhappy as my mind is at pre&s;ent, if I had the lea&s;t acquaintance with the young lady, I wou'd do every thing in my power to &s;ave her from de&s;truction; but he has had honour, or rather prudence enough to conceal her name, and it is of cour&s;e impo&s;&s;ible for me to interfere further.</P>
<P>Once more let me entreat you to exert your utmo&s;t influence with Lucy, to make her di&s;cover Lady Juliana's retreat, and I here pawn my honour both to her and you, that if after one interview her lady&s;hip &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in dooming me to
<PB N="95" REF="99">
perpetual bani&s;hment, I will obey the &s;tern decree, will in&s;tantly quit England, and never more obtrude my&s;elf into her pre&s;ence.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>WILLIAM STANLEY, TO CHARLES EVELYN.</HEAD>
<P>I AM &s;incerely &s;orry for your di&s;ap|pointment, my dear Charles, though more &s;urprized at the effect than cau&s;e, as I could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e that if Lady Juliana &s;eriou&s;ly meant to fly from you, &s;he cou'd think of retiring to &s;o public a place as Bath.&mdash;But I own I flattered my&s;elf that the peculiar gaiety of a &s;cene &s;o entirely new to you, wou'd have di&s;&s;ipated the chagrin you &s;eem to
<PB N="97" REF="101">
feel from her flight; or that &s;ome new object wou'd have attracted your atten|tion, and engaged you in a le&s;s tire&s;ome pur&s;uit.&mdash;But I find you are a bri&s;k hunt&s;man, and are determined to pur&s;ue the &s;port, though you have mi&s;&s;ed the quarry.</P>
<P>I wou'd by all means advi&s;e you to drink the Bath water; it is famous for exhilerating the &s;pirits; but if that &s;hou'd fail, drink wine I entreat you.&mdash;I have known many an un&s;ucce&s;sful pa&s;&s;ion cured by the bumpers that were filled to the obdurate fair-one's health: wine is the modern Lethe, Charles, and, as Gay &s;ays,</P>
<Q>Can bani&s;h care, and cure de&s;pair.</Q>
<P>If I had any better comfort to offer you, I &s;hou'd not perhaps &s;o &s;trongly recom|mend the above recipe; but indeed, my
<PB N="98" REF="102">
friend, I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed from obeying the reque&s;t you have &s;o &s;trenu|ou&s;ly made to me, for I never &s;hall ex|ert my influence over the woman I love, to tempt her to an act of di&s;honour, and &s;uch I hold a breach of confidence to be.&mdash;And were I married to your charming &s;i&s;ter&mdash;delightful thought! I &s;hou'd e&s;teem her &s;till the more for pre&s;erving the &s;ecrets of her friends inviolate, even from me.</P>
<P>Nothing but the romantic pa&s;&s;ion with which you are infected, can excu&s;e your condemning <HI>my</HI> Lucy: gladly do I ac|cept the term, for not betraying Lady Ju|liana's confidence; and give me leave to &s;ay, that this pa&s;&s;ion has rendered your conduct both unju&s;t and ab&s;urd towards the object of it.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="103">
Lady Juliana has acted nobly, and &s;hewn her&s;elf &s;uperior to the meanne&s;s and cruelty of coquetry; &s;he has even &s;a|crificed her own happine&s;s to yours, by depriving her&s;elf of the &s;ociety of her friends, to enable you to conquer an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Believe me, Charles, women &s;peak but too plain when they decline our company; and I think it is high time that you &s;hou'd a&s;k your&s;elf what right you have to break in upon her retirement, and compel her to receive your vi&s;its?</P>
<P>Your only plea is, that &s;he did not re|ject the addre&s;&s;es of your brother; per|haps it is for that very rea&s;on that &s;he de|clines yours.&mdash;Allow me to &s;ay, that Harry was to the full as amiable as you are;&mdash;now &s;urely it is not impo&s;&s;ible that Lady Juliana might have loved your brother; and if &s;o, can you imagine that
<PB N="100" REF="104">
her affections are to de&s;cend with the fa|mily e&s;tate to the next heir?</P>
<P>For &s;hame, Charles! rou&s;e your rea|&s;on, and cea&s;e to per&s;ecute this charming woman;&mdash;&s;he has already, by all ac|counts, &s;uffered too much: the &s;udden, and yet unaccounted for, death of her hu&s;band, brought her almo&s;t to the brink of the grave. Though every one knew it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he cou'd love him, yet her conduct towards him has ever been unimpeached; and what mu&s;t the delicacy of her mind have &s;uffered from living with a man whom &s;he cou'd not avoid dete&s;ting?</P>
<P>Women have infinitely more merit, in &s;uch ca&s;es, than men;&mdash;we are rarely, if ever, compelled to marry again&s;t our inclinations; but if intere&s;t, too often more powerful than any other attraction,
<PB N="101" REF="105">
prevails on us to unite our&s;elves to a di&s;|agreeable object, we are generally &s;o in|human as to make her &s;uffer for the crime we have our&s;elves committed, by puni&s;hing her with neglect, or per|haps a wor&s;e &s;pecies of ill treatment:&mdash;whil&s;t the poor girl, who has been led an unwilling victim to Hymen's altar, can have no &s;afe re&s;ource but &s;ighs and tears, no indulgence is allowed to any former, or future pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he may feel; her af|fections mu&s;t be re&s;trained by the magi|cal ceremony of marriage within her own bo&s;om, becau&s;e &s;he cannot confer them on a wretch &s;he dete&s;ts, and mu&s;t not dare to be&s;tow them el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry that Williams is a &s;coun|drel; &s;uch I think any man who lays a &s;cheme to de&s;troy innocence. But &s;ince knight errantry is exploded, and that the young ladies of our &s;iecle are pretty

<P>Yet in behalf of my own weakne&s;s, give me leave to &s;ay, that acting as you think upon wrong principles, by endea|vouring to obtrude my&s;elf into Lady Ju|liana's

<P>'Tis true, my friend! &s;he has &s;hewn her&s;elf &s;uperior to coquetry, and has vo|luntarily exiled her&s;elf from tho&s;e gay &s;cenes in which &s;he ought to &s;hine, perhaps to &s;hun my hated &s;ight&mdash;Then is it not incumbent upon me to re&s;tore her to an admiring world, to the &s;ociety of tho&s;e &s;he loves.&mdash;O why, alas! am I not of that happy number?&mdash;You will an&s;wer me that pa&s;&s;ion is involuntary&mdash;I know it but too well. You &s;eem to hint that &s;he once loved my brother; is that a rea&s;on for her hating me? There is no rival&s;hip between us now, his pa&s;&s;ions
<PB N="106" REF="110">
are at peace, and if he died po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of her affections, he was much happier than your living friend.</P>
<P>You are a lover, Stanley, but a calm, becau&s;e an happy one.&mdash;Lucy repays your tenderne&s;s, and nought but worldly prudence now impedes your union. For this rea&s;on you treat my &s;ufferings lightly, for even the tendere&s;t &s;impathy of friend&s;hip cannot feel for woes it never has experienced.&mdash;There is no Lethe for unhappy love, and let me add, <HI>en philo&s;ophe,</HI> that wine enflames, but never cures our pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;I &s;hall not, therefore, my kind phy&s;ician, ven|ture upon your <HI>recipe,</HI> but I will &s;ave you the trouble of a father pre&s;crip|tion, by following my own regimen, and cea&s;ing to complain.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="111">
I have met with a tender &s;ympathiz|ing friend and confidante here.&mdash;I &s;hall be angry if you &s;mile, Stanley, when I tell you it is Nancy We&s;ton&mdash;I never &s;aw joy &s;o &s;trongly painted in any coun|tenance as hers, when &s;he met me; our &s;urprize was mutual, but luckily this unexpected interview happened a|bout eight o'clock in the morning, and we had no &s;pectators to re&s;train, or comment upon the &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of a grateful heart.</P>
<P>She told me before I went to Delville, that &s;he was very capable of the mil|linery bu&s;ine&s;s, having formerly lived &s;ome time with a relation of hers, who had kept a &s;hop in Tavi&s;tock-Street, but who was now dead.&mdash;I then told her that if &s;he cou'd find out any me|thod of e&s;tabli&s;hing her&s;elf properly in bu&s;ine&s;s, I wou'd a&s;&s;i&s;t her with the
<PB N="108" REF="112">
means of carrying it on, and left her a few guineas to clothe and &s;upport her, till my return.</P>
<P>During the few hours I &s;pent in London before I came here, my mind was &s;o violently agitated, that I never once thought of Nancy We&s;ton, and the poor girl's mode&s;ty wou'd have pre|vented her from ever applying to me, or being farther burthen&s;ome, as &s;he expre&s;&s;es it, had not chance thrown her in my way at this time.&mdash;She works with a very creditable chamber milli|ner, who had known her formerly at her cou&s;in's, and who will take her into partner&s;hip with a few hundreds, which &s;he &s;hall have with an hearty welcome into the bargain, for I think I need not tell you, that her happine&s;s will con|tribute to mine.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="113">
That puppy Williams has been witty upon hearing that an hand&s;ome milli|ner's doll, as he calls her, drank tea with me, on Sunday la&s;t.&mdash;He hap|pened to call upon me that evening, and my tru&s;ty Scipio refu&s;ed to admit him, tho' he would not make the com|mon excu&s;e of &s;aying I was not at home.&mdash;He has teized me ever &s;ince with a deal of unmeaning ribaldry, and pre&s;&s;es me mo&s;t vehemently to introduce him to my favourite; but that I never &s;hall; &s;he is much too good and amiable to be the &s;port of &s;uch a libertine.</P>
<P>If he may be credited, which I much doubt, he has been &s;ucce&s;sful in his amour&mdash;he no longer conceals the lady's name, 'tis Harri&s;on; he &s;hewed her to me in the rooms&mdash;I never &s;aw a more elegant form, nor a more lively coun|tenance&mdash;when he &s;aluted her, &s;he

&s;miled and blu&s;hed.&mdash;Can it be po&s;&s;i|ble that guilt &s;hould a&s;&s;ume that fir&s;t of female charms, the joint re&s;ult of &s;en|fibility and mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>She danced a minuet with Lord March, and then took out Captain Williams&mdash;&s;he acquitted her&s;elf in both the minuets, with infinite grace and ea&s;e.&mdash;Surely it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he cou'd be con&s;cious of having forfeited her honour, and yet &s;till continue to wear the &s;emblance of chearful innocence.</P>
<P>As &s;he did not dance country dances, I joined her party and drank tea with her&mdash;I talked to her a con&s;iderable time, and tho' I think there is too much levity in her manner, I cannot prevail upon my&s;elf to believe that &s;he has fallen a &s;acrifice to &s;uch a contemptible trifler as Williams.

<HEAD>THE STORY OF MISS WESTON.</HEAD>
<P>Her father died when &s;he was about fourteen, and left to her and her mo|ther, in money and effects, about &s;even hundred pounds. Her mother did not &s;urvive his lo&s;s above a year; and when dying, recommended her daughter to the care of a relation, who kept a milliner's &s;hop in Tavi&s;tock-&s;treet.&mdash;With her, Nancy We&s;ton lived per|fectly happy for two years, till &s;he be|came
<PB N="122" REF="126">
acquainted with a young gentle|man, whom &s;he had often &s;een a &s;chool-boy at Winche&s;ter, though &s;he had never &s;poken to him there.&mdash;He endeavoured to per&s;uade her that he had been in love with her from her childhood, and u&s;ed every art to gain her affections, and &s;educe her virtue.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t he &s;ucceeded but too well, but &s;he continued proof again&s;t every temptation to become his mi|&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;The only expedient then left to get her into his power, was to pro|po&s;e a marriage, which he accordingly offered; and as they were both under age, a journey to Scotland was agreed upon.</P>
<P>They &s;et off in the u&s;ual run-away mode; but her lover had ordered the po&s;tilions to travel we&s;tward in|&s;tead

of northward, and when they ar|rived at Birmingham, he told her they were then at Berwick upon Tweed, and procured a per&s;on in the habit of a clergyman to perform the mar|riage ceremony.&mdash;The innocent girl had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the deceit, and returned to London per|fectly happy in the firm belief of her being legally married to the man &s;he loved.</P>
<P>During their journey, both going and coming back, he had charged her whenever &s;he was out of his &s;ight, to keep a handkerchief clo&s;e to her mouth, and not to utter a &s;yllable to any of the maid-&s;ervants who attended her. This command &s;he had punc|tually obeyed, though the caution was unnece&s;&s;ary; for as &s;he had no doubts,
<PB N="124" REF="130">
&s;he wou'd not have made any enqui|ries.&mdash;</P>
<P>On their return to town, he took lodgings for her in a little &s;treet near Marybone, and told her that &s;he mu&s;t be contented to live in the utmo&s;t pri|vacy and retirement, and by no means to a&s;&s;ume his name, or reveal her&s;elf to her relation in Tavi&s;tock-&s;treet, as his father was living, and wou'd cer|tainly di&s;inherit him if his marriage was di&s;covered.&mdash;To the&s;e prudent re&s;trictions &s;he readily agreed, and &s;pent a year almo&s;t in the clo&s;e&s;t con|&s;inement, hardly ever &s;tirring out, but at a very early hour in the morning, or in the du&s;k of the evening.&mdash;Dur|ing this period of time, &s;he lay in of a daughter, which increa&s;ed her happi|ne&s;s, by affording her con&s;tant em|ployment in &s;uckling and attending
<PB N="125" REF="131">
her, and made the tedious hours of her hu&s;band's frequent ab&s;ences, pa&s;s with le&s;s regret away.&mdash;</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were married, he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the little fortune that her parents had left her, Mrs. We&s;ton not having appointed any tru&s;tee, and the money being placed in the funds.&mdash;As his fondne&s;s abated, his &s;upplied to|wards her declined, and &s;he has frequent|ly had no other &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for many days than bread and tea.</P>
<P>In this inhuman manner did the mon|&s;ter continue to treat the unhappy girl for near two years; till at length, upon her venturing gently to remon&s;trate a|gain&s;t his barbarity to his child and her, he informed her, that &s;he was not any longer to con&s;ider her&s;elf as his wife, and
<PB N="126" REF="132">
openly confe&s;&s;ed the deceit he had prac|ti&s;ed again&s;t her.</P>
<P>The wretched victim became &s;en&s;e|le&s;s at the &s;hock &s;he received from this di&s;covery, in which &s;tate he left her; and when &s;he had recovered her rea&s;on, the woman of the hou&s;e informed her, that the gentleman whom &s;he had hi|therto called her hu&s;band, had di&s;charged the lodgings, and de&s;ired her not to give her any farther credit on his account, as he had turned her off, and was going abroad for three years.</P>
<P>Think, my dear Stanley, what the wretched Nancy We&s;ton mu&s;t have &s;uf|fered at that in&s;tant, and then tell me if you think there is any puni&s;hment too &s;e|vere to be inflicted upon the fiend who cau&s;ed her &s;ufferings?&mdash;The agonies of her mind drove her almo&s;t to de&s;pair,
<PB N="127" REF="133">
and had not her maternal tenderne&s;s pre|vailed over her &s;orrows, &s;he wou'd have terminated them and life together. But her child was innocent, was helple&s;s, and was dear to her; and &s;he virtuou&s;ly re&s;olved to &s;truggle through every mi&s;ery of life, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">arn the means of its &s;upport.</P>
<P>She immediately &s;tripped her&s;elf of every little valuable &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in or|der to di&s;charge her maid, and &s;ome other trifling debts which &s;he owed in the neighbourhood. That done, &s;he deter|mined to remove as far from her pre&s;ent &s;ituation as po&s;&s;ible, that &s;he might not be reproached with the &s;lander that her cruel hu&s;band had thrown upon her.</P>
<P>This left her little to carry with her except her infant, which &s;he took in her arms to a two-pair of &s;tairs back room that &s;he hired in the Borough; and then
<PB N="128" REF="134">
making her&s;elf as decent as her &s;canty wardrobe would permit, &s;he &s;et out for Tavi&s;tock-&s;treet to acquaint her relation with her melancholy circum&s;tances, and intreat her to furni&s;h her with work to enable her to &s;ub&s;i&s;t her&s;elf and her child. To compleat her mi&s;eries, when &s;he ar|rived at the hou&s;e, &s;he found it oucupied by per&s;ons &s;he did not know, and was informed that her cou&s;in had been dead above a year before.</P>
<P>The elegance of her figure and dejec|tion of her countenance, intere&s;ted the woman of the &s;hop &s;o far, that &s;he told her if the people in who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he lodged, or any other per&s;on of credit, would be bound for her, &s;he would take her into the hou&s;e as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, or furni&s;h her with as much work as &s;he cou'd do.&mdash;The unhappy girl knowing that &s;he had no friend that would be re|&s;pon&s;ible
<PB N="129" REF="135">
for her, bur&s;t into tears, thanked her and withdrew.&mdash;The good woman's heart &s;ympathizing with her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he recalled her, and &s;aid, for once &s;he would tru&s;t to her &s;kill in phy|&s;iognomy, and require no &s;ecurity from her but her face, which &s;he believed an hone&s;t one, then gave her a capuchin to make.&mdash;And my poor Nancy returned home, with the plea&s;ing and virtuous pro&s;pect of independance thro' the means of hone&s;t indu&s;try.</P>
<P>But misfortune was not inclined to relinqui&s;h its victim;&mdash;for as &s;he re|turned over We&s;tmin&s;ter Bridge with ha&s;ty &s;teps to &s;uccour her child, &s;he was encompa&s;&s;ed by a mob, who had &s;e|cured a pick-pocket, and were going to admini&s;ter the &s;upplemental di&s;cipline, or common law of ducking, to the cul|prit. But as &s;oon as &s;he could get clear
<PB N="130" REF="136">
of this riotous a&s;&s;embly, &s;he found to her co&s;t, that the mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice are not always free from the very vices they correct, for one of this &s;elf-erected tribunal, had cut off her pockets; in which was every farthing &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and what was &s;till a far greater lo&s;s, the capuchin, which the compa&s;&s;ionate prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a generous mind, had ventured to intru&s;t her with.</P>
<P>On di&s;covering her lo&s;s, the fiend was in&s;tantly at her elbow, tempting her to wait till the mob &s;hould be di&s;per&s;ed, and then throw her&s;elf into the Thames.&mdash;At that moment the cries of an in|fant &s;truck her ear, and in&s;tantly awakened all the mother in her; almo&s;t frantic with grief, &s;he turned her back upon the &s;hocking &s;cene, and with an agonizing heart reached her wretched home.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="137">
She recollected that &s;he had a &s;ilk gown almo&s;t as good as new, it origi|nally co&s;t about five guineas, and &s;he did not doubt but &s;he &s;hould be able to &s;ell it for three&mdash;But there again &s;he was di&s;appointed, the harpies in Mon|mouth-&s;treet, wou'd not give her more than one guinea and a half for it, which &s;he well knew wou'd not pay for the materials of the capuchin &s;he had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>At length by &s;tripping her&s;elf of al|mo&s;t the whole of her wearing apparel, &s;he was enabled to rai&s;e the &s;um of three pounds, and went with it directly to her humane employer in Tavi&s;tock-&s;treet, who li&s;tened to her tale with &s;eeming incredulity, &s;aid &s;he was &s;orry for her misfortune, but if &s;he was &s;ubject to &s;uch accidents, &s;he cou'd not venture to furni&s;h her with any more work.&mdash;She then received the full price for her &s;ilk
<PB N="132" REF="138">
and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her, giving her half a crown, and a va&s;t deal of good advice, again&s;t evil company and bad ways.</P>
<P>I will not dwell longer on the various &s;cenes of wretchedne&s;s this poor crea|ture pa&s;&s;ed through, 'till her child fell ill of the &s;mall-pox, and then all her former woes were &s;wallowed up in her tender apprehen&s;ion for its little life.&mdash;During its illne&s;s &s;he parted with even the common nece&s;&s;aries of raiment &s;he had left, and denied her&s;elf food to ad|mini&s;ter to its &s;u&s;tenance. Her fond maternal cares were all in vain, Provi|dence was plea&s;ed to take her little darl|ing, &s;he &s;ubmitted with re&s;ignation to its lo&s;s, when &s;he reflected on the evils that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily await it.</P>
<P>Life was now become a load that &s;he determined to lay down, but there
<PB N="133" REF="139">
needed no act of violence to ha&s;ten her di&s;&s;olution; famine and grief had &s;eized upon her heart, and in a few hours &s;he wou'd perhaps have re&s;igned her gentle &s;pirits into His hands who gave it, had &s;he been permitted to &s;igh it out in peace.</P>
<P>But the woman in who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he had lodged for a month, was now per|fectly convinced of her inability to pay, and therefore demanded her rent in the mo&s;t boi&s;terous terms, and threatened to &s;end her immediately to a gaol, upon her non-compliance. The being a pri|&s;oner, was the only &s;pecies of calamity &s;he had not yet experienced; her mind was impre&s;&s;ed with horror at the idea, and whil&s;t her wor&s;e than &s;avage land|lady, went out to &s;eek a con&s;table, &s;he &s;tole &s;oftly out of the hou&s;e, and fled &s;he knew not whither.&mdash;Providence
<PB N="134" REF="140">
directed her &s;teps to the Park, in that au&s;picious moment that I met her, which I &s;hall always con&s;ider as one of the fortunate events of my life. Here ends her little hi&s;tory&mdash;and now for mine.&mdash;</P>

<P>As he approached me, I made a vain effort to ri&s;e, and I thought we appeared like two criminals, who waited a &s;en|tence which they dreaded to receive.&mdash;Before I cou'd prevent him, he threw him&s;elf at my feet, and entreated my pardon for having broken in on my re|tirement, and &s;aid he had great rea&s;on to fear, that he was the unhappy cau&s;e of my &s;ecluding my&s;elf from the world. (Ah Lucy! have you betrayed me?) I told him with great &s;incerity, that re|tirement was by no means di&s;agreeable to me, and that it was &s;o long &s;ince I had been engaged in the gaiety of Lon|don, that I feared I &s;hould make but an indifferent figure there.</P>

He &s;aid many civil things, in an|&s;wer, which I &s;hall not repeat, and proceeded to avow his pa&s;&s;ion for me, in the tendere&s;t terms.

<P>I then told him that I was highly &s;en&s;ible of the honour he did me, that I
<PB N="146" REF="154">
had not the lea&s;t doubt of the &s;ince|rity of his regard, and therefore would not trifle with his pa&s;&s;ion, but candidly inform him that there was a bar, an everla&s;ting bar between us, which could not be removed.&mdash;But that if my promi&s;ing never to enter into tho&s;e engagements, with any other per&s;on, which I declined with him, could make him happy, he might depend upon my word; pro|vided he wou'd in return, give up the thoughts of abandoning his country, family and friends, on my account, but endeavour to conquer his ill|placed pa&s;&s;ion, and never &s;peak to me upon the unhappy &s;ubject more.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he had already bound him&s;elf to abide by my deci&s;ion, though mi&s;ery &s;hou'd be his doom; but that he wou'd by no means con|&s;ent

<P>He turned his head a&s;ide, to hide the manly drops that filled his eyes, wiped them away, gazed on me for an in&s;tant, gave a deep &s;igh and bow|ing left me.</P>
<P>I cannot de&s;cribe the &s;ituation of my mind at that in&s;tant, tears luckily came to my relief, and when Mi&s;s Harley came into my dre&s;&s;ing-room, I appeared more like a for&s;aken, than

<P>WHY &s;urely &s;ince the days of Ca&s;&s;andra and Orondates, and &s;uch other &s;illy gentlemen and ladies of ab&s;urd memory, there never was, and I hope never will be, &s;uch a pair of ridiculous noodles as Lady Juliana Harley and Charles Evelyn.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="158">
Whil&s;t I read your letter, my face was like an April &s;ky, half cloud, half &s;un&s;hine.&mdash;I could have laughed, but that I was vexed; and I could have cried, but that I was angry.</P>
<P>Fye Charles! I hate your weep|ing men, yet I don't know why; their tears affect one more than tho&s;e of our own &s;ex. But what bu&s;ine&s;s have I to rea&s;on about &s;uch non&s;en&s;e? I am &s;ure it will never be in my power to make Stanley cry, though I think I &s;hould like mightily to &s;ee him pout fir&s;t, and then blubber; for he has not a good crying face, and I am certain I &s;hould laugh at him.</P>
<P>And &s;o becau&s;e your lady&s;hip, for what rea&s;on I cannot tell, does not happen to like my poor unfortunate brother, he, for&s;ooth, mu&s;t tran&s;port
<PB N="151" REF="159">
him&s;elf into &s;ome foreign country, and you mu&s;t remain locked up with that &s;piteful old Sybil, your &s;i&s;ter-in-law, in your impenetrable fortre&s;s at Harley-hill.&mdash;Ridiculous! as if there was not room enough for you and Charles Evelyn to dwell in this great city without ever meeting for twenty years endways; and I'll warrant you by that time, that if you &s;hou'd chance to knock your heads together, you will not tremble, nor he weep, un|le&s;s the concu&s;&s;ion &s;hould happen to be violent indeed.</P>
<P>Thank you, Lady Juliana! you are va&s;tly good indeed, to confe&s;s your pa&s;&s;ion for my poor dead bro|ther, in order to excu&s;e your cruelty to my poor living one.&mdash;But I will not accept of &s;uch cold confidence.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="160">
Tell me, thou little &s;ly one! who is the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of your heart? or I &s;hall certainly per&s;uade my&s;elf that it has been captivated by &s;ome York&s;hire &s;quire, that you are a&s;hamed of your choice, and therefore make a merit of
<Q>Living in &s;hades with him, and love alone.</Q>
I like that idea well enough, and I fancy I could be romantic if I would give my&s;elf time, but I have not lei|&s;ure&mdash;
<Q>And &s;hew me to the company</Q>

<P>We have had rare doings at our hou&s;e.&mdash;A &s;on and heir born to the noble family of the Selwyns!

<P>But to abate my &s;pirits upon this joyful event, Lady De&s;mond writes me word that Sir James does not chu&s;e to come to London this winter, and &s;he, like a gentle turtle as &s;he is, prefers the lea&s;le&s;s woods of Delville with her Caro Spo&s;o, to all the delights of this gay city without him!&mdash;By the way their hou&s;e has been aired and ready to receive them this month pa&s;t.&mdash;I have a great mind to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and &s;et up for my&s;elf.&mdash;If I don't do that, I mu&s;t ab&s;olutely marry Stanley, that I may be able to a go a

little into the world, for I am quite weary of waiting for a <HI>chaperon.</HI></P>
<P>Well! if I do marry, I will &s;hew you all the difference; my whole time &s;hall be &s;pent in matronizing young ladies, unmarried ones I mean.&mdash;Poor things, they are much to be pitied; for even a dam&s;el of three-&s;core, who has never had an hu&s;band, mu&s;t not venture into a public place, unle&s;s &s;he can per&s;uade &s;ome good-natur'd married girl, who might per|haps be her grand-daughter, to let her tag after her.</P>
<P>Poor Charles! I will beg of him when I &s;ee him not to tran&s;port him|&s;elf; but tran&s;portation is better than hanging, and I think, as a de&s;pairing lover, he is bound in honour to do &s;omething of that &s;ort.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="163">
Once more I intreat you, if you have either love or regard for me, to leave your mu&s;ty ca&s;tle, and come among&s;t us; I have a very particular rea&s;on for de&s;iring it; Stanley has got a verdict in his favour, he grows importunate, I fear I mu&s;t yield: like all bullies, I feel my&s;elf a coward, and &s;hall never be able to keep up my &s;pi|rits on the tremendous occa&s;ion, if you do not lend your a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;The very idea has &s;unk me to the centre.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received both your let|ters, and am &s;incerely concerned for the very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation you are in.</P>
<P>With regard to Williams's acci|dent, you are by no means account|able for it.&mdash;But had your hand directed the bullets which were lodged in his &s;ide, after reading Nancy We&s;|ton's
<PB N="157" REF="165">
&s;tory, I &s;hould not only have acquitted, but applauded you, for ridding the world of &s;uch a mon&s;ter.&mdash;But as I think his blood wou'd &s;tain any hands but tho&s;e of an execu|tioner, I am glad he has done ju&s;tice on him&s;elf; particularly as our legi&s;|lature have not a&s;&s;igned a puni&s;hment for crimes like his, tho' to the full as fatal in their con&s;equences, as any of tho&s;e for which men &s;uffer death.</P>
<P>My indignation and pity were both extremely moved, whil&s;t I peru&s;ed your little novel, &s;uch wou'd I fain think it, for the honour of human nature.&mdash;But facts are &s;tubborn things, and I mu&s;t, tho' unwillingly, &s;ubmit to be ranked of the &s;ame &s;pecies, with a villain who cou'd fir&s;t rob his wife, and then leave her and his child to peri&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="166">
Though I wou'd by no means have advi&s;ed your pur&s;uing Lady Juliana to her retreat, I congratulate you on the conclu&s;ion of your romance; for &s;urely my friend will now exert him|&s;elf to conquer a pa&s;&s;ion, which he mu&s;t own it wou'd be the height of folly to indulge any further.</P>
<P><HI>My Lucy,</HI> for proudly do I now look up to a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that title, dearer far than crowns, has received a long letter from your cruel fair-one; as yet, &s;he keeps the contents of it &s;ecret, but as I hope the day is not far off, when we &s;hall be but one, I may po&s;&s;ibly be acquainted with the particulars of your interview, without putting you to the pain of relating them; and believe me, Charles, the le&s;s you think, talk, or write, upon this &s;ubject, the better.&mdash;We all help

to engrave our misfortunes on our hearts, by bearing them con&s;tantly in mind, and recurring back to them daily, as if we were incapable of turn|ing our thoughts to any other &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>The report of Williams's acci|dent has not yet made its way into Clarges-&s;treet, and you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf I &s;hall not be the fir&s;t to pro|mulgate the intelligence for many and good rea&s;ons.&mdash;Heavens! how would Selwyn preach, and how terrified would your &s;i&s;ters be?&mdash;The few per|&s;ons I have heard mention the affair, have been candid enough to &s;uppo&s;e that the pi&s;tol went off by accident, but they all believe, that jealou&s;y of a favourite mi&s;tre&s;s, was the occa&s;ion of his &s;natching it up.</P>

Fear not my friend&s;hip, Charles, upon this, or any other occa&s;ion, tho' I both hope and believe this is the only one, I &s;hall ever have to prove it.&mdash;You know I allow but two te&s;ts of this generous affection, the not hearing one's friend abu&s;ed, and the &s;haring one's pur&s;e with him.&mdash;You mu&s;t be a &s;pendthrift indeed, if you &s;hou'd ever have recour&s;e to mine.&mdash;Yet, I have &s;ome apprehen&s;ions of your exhau&s;ting your own, if you continue to &s;upply Sir James De&s;|mond's nece&s;&s;ities, which I hear and fear to be very great.

<P>If you did not know my heart to be as generous as your own, I would
<PB N="161" REF="169">
not venture to &s;peak thus freely, but the large drafts you have lately made in favour of Sir James De&s;mond, have alarmed my friend&s;hip &s;o far, as to make me wi&s;h to awaken your di&s;cre|tion.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that Sewell is come to follow his laudable vocation at Bath, as there was nothing left for him to prey upon at Delville.&mdash;I cannot help it Charles, but I dete&s;t that man.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bath.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY &s;pirits have been kept in &s;o con|&s;tant an agitation for &s;ome time pa&s;t, by the di&s;agreeable &s;cenes I have been engaged in, that I know not whether I have recollection &s;ufficient to de|&s;cribe them to you.&mdash;However I will &s;trive to methodize my thoughts, and
<PB N="164" REF="172">
begin by recurring back to my inter|view with Mi&s;s Harri&s;on.</P>
<P>I found her pale, trembling, and in tears.&mdash;As I entered the room, &s;he cried out, O Sir! what is become of Captain Williams?</P>
<P>In as few words as po&s;&s;ible I related to her the cau&s;e of the unhappy acci|dent that happened at my lodgings, and when I mentioned his marriage with Nancy We&s;ton, &s;he fell upon her knees, and exclaimed&mdash;Great Author of all good! accept my thanks, and withdraw not thy protecting provi|dence from the being thou ha&s;t &s;aved from the complicated mi&s;ery of add|ing guilt to the &s;inner's &s;oul, and &s;or|row to the wretched and innocent &s;uf|ferer!&mdash;This day, Sir, I was to have been made his wife, by &s;uch another
<PB N="165" REF="173">
marriage, I &s;uppo&s;e, as was his fir&s;t.&mdash;The chai&s;e now waits within an hun|dred yards that was to have carried my maid and me to Bri&s;tol, where he was to have met us with a clergyman, a friend of his, who, as we were both of age, would have di&s;pen&s;ed with what he called the unnece&s;&s;ary formality of a licence, and married us in private.</P>
<P>I mo&s;t &s;incerely congratulated this amiable girl upon the providential e&s;cape &s;he had met with, in not be|ing united to Captain Williams, even though his intentions towards her might have been &s;trictly honourable, if that were po&s;&s;ible in his pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances, and which, without want of charity, I think I may rea&s;onably doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="174">
She appeared extremely affected at Mrs. Williams's di&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid &s;he hoped her hu&s;band would recover to do ju&s;tice to her merit, and reward her &s;ufferings, but that &s;he never would upon any account &s;ee him more, for &s;he could not help owning that &s;he had loved him tenderly.&mdash;She talked of quitting Bath immediately.&mdash;As a friend, I took the liberty of oppo&s;ing her intention, and advi&s;ed her not only to remain where &s;he was, but to appear as little affected as po&s;&s;ible at the misfortune that had befallen her worthle&s;s lover.&mdash;She thanked me for my advice, and promi&s;ed to follow it as far as &s;he might be able.</P>
<P>The moment I left Mi&s;s Harri&s;on, I &s;et off in pur&s;uit of my de&s;tiny,&mdash;you know it Stanley.&mdash;Fear not that I &s;hall ever attempt to de&s;cribe the

&s;cene that pa&s;&s;ed between Lady Juliana and me.&mdash;No words will ever be able to expre&s;s my feelings, nor no time to era&s;e them from my heart.&mdash;Yet let me boa&s;t her tenderne&s;s, and tell you, that &s;he wept for your unhappy friend!&mdash;tears do not flow from ha|tred,&mdash;angels tears are tears of pity.&mdash;Whil&s;t I have life I will cheri&s;h the fond remembrance of her gentle &s;orrow.&mdash;Do not chide me Stanley.&mdash;The only glimp&s;e I have of happine&s;s is the being certain, that &s;he does not hate me.&mdash;</P>
<P>At my return hither, I found Wil|liams in a very dangerous &s;tate, the &s;urgeons had extracted but one of the balls, and he wou'd not &s;uffer them to proceed any farther, till I was pre|&s;ent, as he &s;eemed to be per&s;uaded that he &s;hould die in the operation.
<PB N="168" REF="176">
I went immediately to his bed&s;ide, he was in a high fever, but perfectly in his &s;en&s;es, and his countenance ex|pre&s;&s;ive of the extreme&s;t angui&s;h.&mdash;He took me by the hand, and &s;aid, Can you forgive the anxiety I have co&s;t you, and look with compa&s;&s;ion on a wretch who is now expiating his crimes by the &s;evere&s;t torments.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured him, that I &s;incerely lamented the accident that had re|duced him to &s;uch a &s;ituation, and mo&s;t truly compa&s;&s;ionated his &s;uffer|ings, but that I thought they might be relieved, if he wou'd &s;uffer the &s;urgeons to perform the nece&s;&s;ary ope|ration of extracting the other ball.&mdash;He an&s;wered, No&mdash;they cannot ea&s;e my pains&mdash;that wretched woman.&mdash;But I own my&s;elf accountable for all her crimes, and they &s;it heavy at my
<PB N="169" REF="177">
heart.&mdash;She was innocent when I met with her,&mdash;and is &s;o &s;till, upon my honour.&mdash;I replied, her &s;ufferings are all you have to an&s;wer for, and they, indeed, have been great.&mdash;But were I now even at the point of death, I wou'd atte&s;t her innocence with my late&s;t words.&mdash;I have known all her mi&s;eries, but by all that is &s;acred, &s;he is free from guilt of any kind.&mdash;He wept aloud&mdash;and with dif|ficulty articulated&mdash;then I am &s;till a greater villain.</P>
<P>I told him I rejoiced in his contri|tion, as he yet had it in his power in &s;ome mea&s;ure to atone the crimes he had committed, by doing ju&s;tice to his unhappy wife.&mdash;He remained &s;ilent for &s;ome time, then groaned mo&s;t heavily,&mdash;and &s;aid,&mdash;let me &s;ee her&mdash;but can &s;he bear the &s;ight of

I have injured her too&mdash;believe me, &s;he is a virtuous woman, Evelyn.</P>
<P>I replied, I do believe it mo&s;t &s;incerely.&mdash;But do not wander from your pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.&mdash;Your mind will be much ea&s;ier, when you have &s;een your wife. He gazed upon me with a piercing look, and &s;aid, you are a man of honour, and cou'd not be &s;o ba&s;e as to deceive a dying man. You &s;ay my wife is guiltle&s;s, free from &s;tain.&mdash;Then let her come, and
<PB N="171" REF="179">
pardon her cruel hu&s;band.&mdash;I repeated every &s;olemn a&s;&s;urance that I could give him of her blamele&s;s conduct, with which he &s;eemed perfectly &s;atis|fied, and I went to bring her to his bed-&s;ide.</P>
<P>I found her in the dining-room from whence &s;he had &s;carcely &s;tirred, from the time I left her. In her &s;itua|tion it was impo&s;&s;ible her mind cou'd feel repo&s;e, or her body re&s;t. She appeared to me even a more melan|choly object, than when I met her in the Park; her eyes were &s;woln with tears, and her face pale and ema|ciated. When I told her that her hu&s;band de&s;ired to &s;ee her, &s;he &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;ible, &s;he dared not, cou'd not look upon the man &s;he had murdered, nor cou'd &s;he ever more know peace or comfort.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="180">
With much difficulty I rea&s;oned down her groundle&s;s apprehen&s;ions, of having cau&s;ed his death, and led, or rather &s;upported her trembling fee|ble frame to his bed-&s;ide; &s;he dropped upon her knees, and I retired quick from a &s;cene that was by much too intere&s;ting for my pre&s;ent &s;tate of mind.</P>
<P>In about an hour's time he &s;ent for me; he appeared much more com|po&s;ed than when I left him, but &s;till in extreme agony.&mdash;He begged I would con&s;ult his &s;urgeon, and let him know his real &s;tate, for he had much to do, and he believed but a very &s;hort &s;pace to get it done.&mdash;He pro|mi&s;ed to &s;ubmit to any operation that &s;hou'd be thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave his life, and thanked me a thou&s;and
<PB N="173" REF="181">
times for the gleam of peace which I had given to his torn mind.</P>
<P>I immediately &s;ummoned a con&s;ul|lation of all the phy&s;ical people of eminence at Bath, but they wou'd not venture to pronounce, with any degree of certainty, till a further experi|ment had been made to come at the ball.</P>
<P>I acquainted him with their opi|nions, and begged of him to let the trial be in&s;tantly made, but he pe|remptorily refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to it, till twelve o'clock to-morrow, as he &s;aid he had &s;till more important affairs to execute than that. He de&s;ired a pro|per per&s;on might be &s;ent for to draw his will, and entreated me to obtain a licence, and get a clergyman to marry
<PB N="174" REF="182">
him in due form, at nine o'clock to|morrow morning, to his pre&s;ent no|minal wife. He al&s;o mo&s;t earne&s;tly reque&s;ted me to wait upon Mi&s;s Har|ri&s;on, and implore her forgivene&s;s of an unhappy dying man, who never cou'd forgive him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Need I tell you that I have been &s;trongly affected with Williams's con|trition? I mo&s;t &s;incerely pray that he may live to enjoy the fruits of his re|pentance, and by his future conduct, obliterate his pa&s;t.&mdash;I have obeyed all his commands, and am at pre&s;ent &s;o compleatly harra&s;&s;ed both in mind and body, that I mu&s;t decline entering into the particulars of your letter, till another opportunity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be pre&s;ent at Williams's marriage, and at the dre&s;&s;ing of his

<HEAD>LADY DESMOND, TO CHARLES EVELYN.</HEAD>
<P>MY deare&s;t Charles, I have read in &s;ome <HI>good</HI> author, that genero&s;ity and gratitude are twins, who have ne|ver been &s;eparated, but always &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the &s;ame heart.&mdash;In yours, then, my brother, you will find the &s;enti|ments of mine; &s;entiments which can only be felt, but never expre&s;&s;ed: or
<PB N="181" REF="189">
if they could, the &s;en&s;ation would &s;till remain as unintelligible to the bulk of human-kind as the idea of a &s;ixth &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>You will perhaps be &s;uprized when I tell you that I have &s;hed more tears this la&s;t week, than I have for many months before.</P>
<Q><L>But joy has its tears as well as grief,</L>
<L>And mine were tears of joy.</L></Q>
<P>There would be no enduring the tran&s;port of conferring happine&s;s on tho&s;e we love, without that kind re|lief.&mdash;Surely, my brother, you mu&s;t have wept your&s;elf when you made Emma happy.</P>
<P>I think my&s;elf much obliged to Mr. Sewell for the di&s;patch he made
<PB N="182" REF="190">
from Bath to Delville with your bills. Every thing here now wears a chearful a&s;pect; and I fancy as I look upon the lawn, that it has acquired a brighter verdure than it u&s;ed to wear, even in the &s;pring.&mdash;But though this idea may be imaginary, I am certain that my beloved Sir James has ca&s;t away the gloom that hung upon his brow, and the &s;oft &s;miles of &s;weet content now reign triumphant there. I think he was even more oppre&s;&s;ed with gratitude than me, when I deli|vered your generous gift into his hands.&mdash;He is gone to London to ful|fil the purpo&s;e for which it was de|&s;igned.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now have no more credi|tors, for &s;ure I am that he will never more involve him&s;elf by play.&mdash;Tho' at this time I could not bring my&s;elf
<PB N="183" REF="191">
to hint even the mo&s;t di&s;tant de&s;ire he &s;hould relinqui&s;h it; but well he knows how ardently I wi&s;h he &s;hould, and as he loves me with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, I cannot doubt his giving me this proof of his affection.</P>
<P>Mr. Sewell is gone with Sir James to London, and I am to follow in a fortnight.&mdash;Sir James thinks our hou&s;e cannot be &s;ufficiently aired in le&s;s time, and would not have me, or our dear little Fanny, run the hazard of catching cold.&mdash;I have a thou&s;and apprehen&s;ions about his health, and earne&s;tly wi&s;h that he could have been content to pa&s;s the winter here as we had intended.</P>
<P>Mr. Sewell has informed me that you had paid a vi&s;it to Lady Juliana Harley; he could not tell me what
<PB N="184" REF="192">
was the re&s;ult, though I gue&s;s it but too well, from his &s;aying that you ap|peared dejected at your return.&mdash;Why will you court unhappine&s;s by pur&s;uing perhaps the only woman within your &s;phere of life that would fly from you? Ble&s;t as you are with virtue, health, and fortune, why mu&s;t you add to the too numerous proofs, that happine&s;s is not attainable on earth?</P>
<P>Forgive me, Charles, this little op|po&s;ition to your only irrational pur|&s;uit.&mdash;Few are the per&s;ons, even among&s;t the be&s;t, within who&s;e reach felicity &s;eems placed; all mu&s;t de|&s;erve before they can obtain it, but even then we &s;ometimes ca&s;t it from us, and like Ixion, gra&s;p a cloud.&mdash;May you rever&s;e the fable, and long enjoy what you &s;o well de&s;erve! My little Fanny's playful fondne&s;s will
<PB N="185" REF="193">
not &s;uffer me longer to indulge in expre&s;&s;ing the ardent wi&s;hes of my heart, for my loved friend and bro|ther, but from that &s;ource they &s;hall for ever flow to the Great Fountain of all good, to ble&s;s, protect, and guide you!</P>

<HEAD>CHARLES EVELYN, TO LADY DESMOND.</HEAD>
<P>I SINCERELY wi&s;h that my dear Emma's nerves were a little &s;tronger, for though I confe&s;s my&s;elf extremely plea&s;ed with the tenderne&s;s of your letter, I for your &s;ake, lament the &s;en&s;ibility which dictated it.&mdash;This is not a world for delicate minds to be happy in.</P>
<Q><PB N="187" REF="195">
<L>Nor peace, nor ea&s;e, that heart can know</L>
<L>That like the needle true,</L>
<L>Turns at the touch of joy or woe,</L>
<L>But turning, trembles too.</L></Q>
<P>There never was a &s;entiment more elegantly expre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;I would rather have been the author of that &s;ingle &s;tanza, than of a dozen volumes of poetry; nay, and of good poetry too. But why, my Emma, will you di&s;tre&s;s me by talking of gratitude? Of what value is wealth if it does not enable us to purcha&s;e happine&s;s? and to diffu&s;e is to enjoy it; the greate&s;t mi&s;er upon earth cannot confine his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;olely to him&s;elf, nor can the mo&s;t lux|urious man that lives, appropriate to his own u&s;e the tithe of what he di&s;|&s;ipates.&mdash;He who be&s;tows, pre&s;erves his property; a gift once made cannot be le&s;&s;ened; it is a fund e&s;tabli&s;hed in
<PB N="188" REF="196">
a grateful heart, which even the great de&s;troyer, Time, cannot im|pair.</P>
<P>But holding riches lightly as I do, I would not wi&s;h that mine &s;hould flit away on the gro&s;s pinions of <HI>Folly</HI> or of <HI>Vice:</HI> I therefore intreat you to exert all the influence you have over your beloved Sir James, to prevail on him to conquer a pa&s;&s;ion that mu&s;t come under one or other of <HI>tho&s;e</HI> denominations.&mdash;You mu&s;t know that I mean his love of play.</P>
<P>Yet I approve of your delicacy in not mentioning the &s;ubject, at a time when it might have appeared like making conditions for what he thought a favour; and indeed I &s;hould be bet|ter plea&s;ed, if he were voluntarily to renounce gaming, than if he &s;acri|ficed
<PB N="189" REF="197">
his inclination even to your re|que&s;t.</P>
<P>One of tho&s;e harpies whom I &s;aw at Delville, a Mr. Simp&s;on, has I hear lo&s;t large &s;ums of money here.&mdash;I am glad Sir James is not near enough to a&s;&s;i&s;t in repairing his lo&s;&s;es.&mdash;I think Mr. Sewell a worthy, and I may add, a &s;en&s;ible man, as he has had prudence enough to relinqui&s;h gaming.&mdash;He profe&s;&s;es the &s;incere&s;t regard for both you and your hu&s;band.&mdash;However I think I have a little rea|&s;on to chide, that he &s;hou'd inform me of Sir James's difficulties.&mdash;Was he more worthy of my Emma's con|fidence than I?</P>
<P>I am very glad to hear you are go|ing to London; di&s;&s;ipation, contrary to its u&s;ual effects, will be of infi|nite
<PB N="190" REF="198">
&s;ervice to you.

<HEAD>GEORGE SEWELL, TO JOHN SIMPSON.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT the devil could prevent you, Jack, from meeting us at Sali&s;|bury? Do you know that the baronet has been very near &s;lipping through our hands, and that at the very time when he is be&s;t worth our holding! Why, man, we have found a mine, the trea&s;ures of the Ea&s;t lie before us;
<PB N="193" REF="201">
Evelyn's whole fortune may be ours, Lady De&s;mond has got a key to his pur&s;e, out of which &s;he will certainly fill her hu&s;band's, and we the galant knights of indu&s;try will as &s;urely empty it.</P>
<P>But to explain this my&s;tery. We were all in a doleful way, when you, like a fal&s;e friend, left us at Delville. Not a &s;hilling to be rai&s;ed, not a &s;take left unmortgaged but my lady's jointure, and the baronet &s;wore he would peri&s;h rather than rob his wife. The intended journey to London was entirely laid a&s;ide, and they were to pa&s;s the winter <HI>&s;olus cum &s;ola.&mdash;</HI>He grew grave and peevi&s;h; &s;he retained her u&s;ual gentle chearfulne&s;s: upon my &s;oul, Jack, &s;he is a very amiable woman, and I am really glad we did not meddle with the jointure; parti|cularly,
<PB N="194" REF="202">
as we can now do very well without it.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for me to think of remaining in &s;uch a dull &s;cene, where I knew there was nothing to be got, &s;o I made a few wry faces at ta|ble, talked of a flying gout, and &s;et out to drink the Bath water, which, like the Iri&s;h u&s;quebaugh, has always a little gold floating in it, which may be ea&s;ily extracted by &s;uch ingenious chymi&s;ts as you and I.</P>
<P>To my great joy one of the fir&s;t per|&s;ons I met with there, was the prudent and &s;en&s;ible Mr. Charles Evelyn.&mdash;I had, you know, ingratiated my&s;elf into his good opinion at Delville, by advi&s;ing Sir James De&s;mond again&s;t play, and I re&s;olved to &s;trengthen his prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by declaring that I had
<PB N="195" REF="203">
entirely left it off my&s;elf.&mdash;That was a &s;troke beyond you, Simp&s;on.&mdash;I was fortunate enough to be able to ac|quaint him with the place of his Dul|cinea's retreat, which he con&s;idered as a real obligation.&mdash;There has not been &s;uch a Quixote in England the&s;e fifty years.&mdash;Before he &s;et out on his wildgoo&s;e cha&s;e, I took occa&s;ion to mention the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of the De&s;mond family, but under the &s;eal of &s;ecrecy, as I told him I knew the baronet's pride would never &s;uffer him to reveal the con&s;equences of that mi&s;conduct, he now &s;o &s;incerely re|pented of.&mdash;I talked in raptures of Lady De&s;mond's virtues, and &s;wore that Sir James and &s;he would be the happie&s;t couple on earth if their cir|cum&s;tances were tolerably ea&s;y.&mdash;The gudgeon bit, and immediately a&s;ked me what &s;um I thought would relieve
<PB N="196" REF="204">
Sir James from his pre&s;ent difficulties? I he&s;itated to pronounce, but upon being pre&s;&s;ed, &s;aid I imagined four or five thou&s;and pounds would di&s;charge all his impatient creditors, though I well knew that thrice that &s;um would not extricate him.</P>
<P>The idiot Evelyn, whom I &s;uppo&s;e to be as rich as the Great Mogul, &s;at down directly and drew drafts for &s;ix thou&s;and pounds in favour of Sir James De&s;mond, and as &s;oon as they returned accepted, con&s;igned them to my <HI>friendly</HI> care, to be delivered into the hands of his fair &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;And am I not a friend, indeed! for I don't ex|pect above half this &s;um to roll into your pocket, or mine?</P>
<P>Both Sir James and Lady De&s;mond were &s;trongly affected at this proof of
<PB N="197" REF="205">
Evelyn's genero&s;ity; and the former was very near making a vow never to play again.&mdash;I trembled le&s;t his wife &s;hould have &s;trengthened his wavering re&s;olution, by making it her reque&s;t; but if &s;he had, I would have laid five to three again&s;t any promi&s;e that Sir James could make; for a man may as ea&s;ily be cured of the hy|drophobia, as of an itch for gaming.&mdash;All I feared was, that he might get into other hands, and therefore wrote to you to meet and accompany us to London; for to be &s;ure if he was not an egregious gull, he mu&s;t be &s;urprized at our <HI>con&s;tant</HI> good luck.</P>
<P>I contrived, as I wrote you word, that we &s;hould lye at Sali&s;bury.&mdash;After &s;upper, the baronet &s;eemed pen&s;ive, I pu&s;hed about the bottle, and expected he would call for cards, but he yawned,
<PB N="198" REF="206">
and talked of going to bed.&mdash;On which I &s;tept out of the room, and returned in a moment with a box and dice, and propo&s;ed taking a ca&s;t or two, merely to amu&s;e the time, for &s;ilver.&mdash;He could not re&s;i&s;t the dear temptation, and that jilt fortune, and my own negligence, in not having a die in my pocket, turned again&s;t me, and I lo&s;t an hundred guineas.&mdash;But <HI>tant mieux,</HI> &s;ay I, 'tis a good bait, and will catch thou&s;ands.&mdash;The baronet exulted vio|lently, as all tho&s;e fellows do that are not u&s;ed to win.&mdash;I congratulated him on the change of his luck, &s;aid For|tune was certainly weary of per&s;ecu|ting him, and that it was highly pro|bable he would now recover all his former lo&s;&s;es.&mdash;He &s;miled at the idea, and went to bed in high &s;pirits.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="207">
We did not get to town till late la&s;t night, and then parted; this day he dines with his brother-in-law Sel|wyn, and has de&s;ired me to meet him in the evening at his own hou&s;e.&mdash;I have accepted the invitation, and &s;hall go properly prepared. In my next I hope to give you a good ac|count of him, or his money, which is a much better thing.&mdash;I am &s;orry you are not here; we mu&s;t &s;trike while the iron is hot, and re&s;cue his dear gui|neas from falling into the hands of "odious vulgar trade&s;men," as Lady Townley &s;ays.</P>

<HEAD>MISS EVELYN, TO LADY JULIANA HARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>THANK you, my good Mi&s;s Harley, with all my heart, for hav|ing been able to effect, by the pure dint of a diabolical di&s;po&s;ition, what all the earne&s;t entreaties of Lady Ju|liana's <HI>favourite friend,</HI> had &s;olicited in vain. Old adages have always been highly e&s;teemed by me, for I firmly believe our ance&s;tors were wi&s;er than

<P>I am delighted at the idea of Mi&s;s Harley's falling in love by a <HI>coup d'oeil,</HI> and &s;hall certainly con|gratulate Charles on his conque&s;t. Dry wood is more apt to take fire, than when 'tis green, we all know, but why the deuce came Mi&s;s <HI>Touch|wood,</HI> to make &s;uch a &s;moke and pother?&mdash;I never knew but one per|&s;on, be&s;ides Mi&s;s Harley, who&s;e tem|per was not &s;oftened by love; &s;he poor dear was a middle-aged Lady al&s;o, and the fonder &s;he grew of her lover, the more &s;piteful &s;he became to
<PB N="208" REF="218">
all the re&s;t of the world.&mdash;But vari|ous are the effects of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, upon the human body, and as various are the effects of the &s;elf-&s;ame pa&s;&s;ion upon the human mind.&mdash;I think that la&s;t a good pretty philo&s;ophical &s;ort of a &s;entence.&mdash;'Tis poetical, at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>And &s;o, my dear Lady, you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that I do but je&s;t, when I talk of terrors in regard to a certain event, and in the very next line you kindly allow, that there is &s;omething very awful in a marriage con|tract, to a &s;en&s;ible and delicate mind.</P>
<P>Thank you, my &s;weet friend, for this obliging inuendo;&mdash;but I am not in a humour to quarrel, and the only revenge I de&s;ire to take, for this &s;ly hint, is to in&s;i&s;t upon your being pre|&s;ent at my <HI>nuptials,</HI> I think that &s;ounds better than <HI>wedding,</HI> and conveys a

<Q><L>I do beguile the thing I am,</L>
<L>With &s;eeming otherwi&s;e.</L></Q>
I feel that there is &s;omething very tremendous in uniting our fate, with that of a per&s;on who&s;e temper and &s;entiments it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be thoroughly acquainted with, and becoming as it were, dependent upon another for our temporal and eter|nal happine&s;s.&mdash;For I agree with Dr. Tillot&s;on, "That an unhappy mar|riage is a le&s;&s;er Hell, in pa&s;&s;age to the greater."&mdash;</P>

<P>NO, Stanley! no, my friend! I will not damp your joys; nor gloom, nor &s;orrow, &s;hall obtrude on your fe&s;tivity.&mdash;I never &s;hall put on a wedding garment, and therefore will not be a gue&s;t at yours.&mdash;Yet &s;hall my heart mo&s;t truly &s;ympathize

<P>Lucy has many good and amiable qualities, and will, I am convinced, exert them all to in&s;ure the happine&s;s of the man &s;he loves.&mdash;I don't know any young woman better qualified to make a good wife; &s;he has an excellent temper, and con&s;tant &s;pirits; and I am per&s;uaded, that chear&s;ulne&s;s is a very nece&s;&s;ary ingredient in matri|mony.&mdash;The languid and dejected part of her &s;ex, &s;eem to claim a con&s;tant exertion of their hu&s;band's tenderne&s;s; they appear to be incapable of bearing their part in the difficulties, or di|&s;tre&s;&s;es of life, and of cour&s;e throw the whole load upon the men.&mdash;But tho' 'tis natural to love the being we pro|tect, 'tis as rea&s;onable to expect, that

<P>NOT all the gay and plea&s;ing &s;cenes in which I have been engaged &s;ince my arrival here have been able to efface the tender melancholy I felt at bidding you adieu.&mdash;Though we parted at the Devizes, you accompa|nied me all the way to London; not

even my little Fanny's chearful prat|tle, and innocent curio&s;ity, could rou&s;e me &s;ufficiently from my reverie to make me an&s;wer her que&s;tions ra|tionally.&mdash;My mind was totally occu|pied on the peculiar unhappine&s;s of yours, in not being able to conquer a pa&s;&s;ion, which you acknowledge to be hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>My anxiety for you has rendered me unju&s;t: I could not receive Lady Juliana with the cordiality and affec|tion I u&s;ed to feel for her, nor ca&s;t my eyes upon her elegant form with|out wi&s;hing to le&s;&s;en her charms.&mdash;No woman ever took more pains to de|preciate a rival's beauties to a waver|ing lover, than I have done to find &s;ome fault with her's.&mdash;But it is in vain&mdash;I cannot di&s;cover a &s;ingle im|perfection, except her being the cau&s;e,

<P>Lady Juliana endeavoured to ap|pear chearful at my &s;i&s;ter's wedding, but every one might &s;ee <HI>&s;he &s;trove</HI> to be &s;o.&mdash;What cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned for &s;uch a depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits in one who is &s;urrounded with all the out|ward &s;igns of happine&s;s?&mdash;She cannot &s;urely love in vain&mdash;I know not what to think of her.&mdash;But this is the la&s;t time that even your intreaties &s;hall prevail on me to mention her again.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="238">
I have been involved in a continued circle, or rather whirl, of public and private amu&s;ements ever &s;ince I came to town; yet I feel I have an heart, and that it grieves for you.&mdash;I look back with plea&s;ure on the three days I &s;pent with you at Bath; though there is a good deal of regret mingled with the recollection, at not having had it in my power to per&s;uade you to come up to London.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Stanley are as happy as it is po&s;&s;ible to be, and with true joy I &s;ay, they have a pro&s;pect of con|tinuing &s;o, if happine&s;s were a <HI>peren|nial</HI> flower.&mdash;But alas! few are the &s;oils in which it always blooms.&mdash;In mo&s;t that I have &s;een, 'tis but an <HI>an|nual;</HI> nay, &s;ometimes bla&s;ted e'er it can take root.&mdash;'Tis a cele&s;tial plant,

<P>Do not from hence conclude I am unhappy; if I were, I &s;hould de&s;erve to be &s;o, for I &s;hould be ungrateful to Providence and to you.&mdash;No, let my thankful heart acknowledge its feli|city, by &s;aying that my beloved Sir James and Fanny both are well, and that I am, to the be&s;t of brothers, an affectionate &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<P>Though Lady De&s;mond appears the gentle&s;t of beings, I begin to fancy that her hu&s;band is a little in awe of her, from his not venturing to play, &s;ince &s;he came to town.&mdash;If this &s;hou'd be the ca&s;e, I will take care that her reign &s;hall be &s;hort, by throwing out hints of his apparent &s;ubjection, at which, I am &s;ure the

Baronet's pride will revolt, and then let her lady&s;hip look to her jointure.&mdash;If I can cure his qualms about it, I &s;hall have none of my own, hence-&s;orward.&mdash;</P>
<P>There is a good clever woman in their &s;et, that I think has &s;pirit enough for any thing; a Madam du Pont, &s;he loves play, and &s;eems to under&s;tand it; but I fancy &s;he is poor. Suppo&s;e we were to admit her of our &s;ociety? women are the be&s;t decoy|ducks in the world.&mdash;I don't fancy &s;he would have many &s;cruples, for I have heard that &s;he is an infamous daugh|ter to an indulgent mother, who&s;e circum&s;tances &s;he has ruined.&mdash;</P>
<P>I have &s;ome doubts about Mon&s;ieur, her hu&s;band, he &s;eems to be a man of honour; but if he is fond of her, he will ea&s;ily be converted into&mdash;

Now for my &s;ecret.&mdash;Hu&s;h, let me whi&s;per in your ear.&mdash;It is not Cap|tain Harri&s;on, but Charles Evelyn, that has captivated the tender heart of the young and beautiful Mi&s;s Harley.&mdash;Lady Juliana a&s;&s;ures me, that her &s;i&s;ter-in-law is very little turned of thirty; but were I to judge, I think we might add ten to the &s;core, and bring her almo&s;t on the road to fifty.&mdash;But were &s;he fifteen, I &s;hou'd not like her; but that is no rea&s;on for your di&s;like; and now that I am married and &s;ettled as it were, I wou'd fain have you in the &s;ame pre|dicament.&mdash;Yet I wi&s;h you to look &s;omewhere el&s;e for a wife, as I am per&s;uaded there never will be a match, between a Harley and an Evelyn.</P>
<P>They &s;ay the Iri&s;h ladies are re|markably hand&s;ome; who knows but
<PB N="244" REF="254">
&s;ome fair bogtrotter may lay hold of your heart, and tran&s;mogrify you into a brogueneer.&mdash;You a&s;k me for com|mi&s;&s;ions; bring me over a &s;i&s;ter-in-law, and I won't trouble you for any el&s;e; but if you return &s;ingle, I de|&s;ire you to bring me a great quantity of Iri&s;h &s;tuff, and every other kind of countraband commodity, you can contrive to &s;muggle, that is the manu|facture of that country.</P>
<P>I know you won't think my letter worth the po&s;tage, if I don't &s;ay &s;omething of Lady Juliana.&mdash;Seri|ou&s;ly, Charles, &s;he gives me great unea&s;ine&s;s; both her health and &s;pirits decline vi&s;ibly, and I am certain there is a cruel &s;omething, that preys upon her heart.&mdash;She laments her being the cau&s;e of your ab&s;enting your&s;elf from your family, yet highly approves
<PB N="245" REF="255">
your &s;hunning her.&mdash;She &s;ometimes talks of going abroad, but I don't believe &s;he will ever have re&s;olution enough to travel; for even I cannot prevail on her to &s;tir from her own fire-&s;ide.&mdash;In &s;hort, &s;he is a riddle too difficult for me to expound.</P>

<P>P. S.

<HEAD>GEORGE SEWELL, TO JOHN SIMPSON.</HEAD>
<P>SO the wheel is gone round I find, and you are now pretty near the top.&mdash;Climb away, Jack, but remem|ber to &s;it fa&s;t when you get on the pinnacle.&mdash;Such another tumble as your la&s;t would go near to undo us.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="258">
Dame Fortune has been plea&s;ed to give me a lift al&s;o, yet I could not have gone on cleverly if you had not &s;upplied me with the <HI>ready.&mdash;</HI>The ba|ronet's ca&s;h is exhau&s;ted, and I have been kind enough to furni&s;h him with a brace of hundreds, which added to the &s;um he has lo&s;t to me &s;ince I wrote la&s;t, makes a cool thou&s;and; and all I have to &s;hew for it is a piece of &s;tamped paper, bond and warrant, my boy, that's all.</P>
<P>Give me credit, Jack, I am a Ma|chiavel in politics.&mdash;Madame Du Pont is the fine&s;t bait I ever had to an|gle with; &s;he is really a woman of &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, and will very &s;oon be as adroit as any of our fraternity.&mdash;Her hu&s;band is a &s;illy fellow, but he is a Frenchman, and &s;uffers her to do ju&s;t what &s;he plea&s;es.&mdash;She coquets
<PB N="249" REF="259">
with the baronet, and he lo&s;es his mo|ney with the be&s;t grace imaginable.&mdash;Filthy dice are bani&s;hed, Mon&s;ieur Du Pont thinks it too ma&s;culine for ladies to play at hazard; and the noi&s;e of the box gives Lady De&s;mond the head-ach.&mdash;I am much mi&s;taken if the heart-ach is not added to her other complaints very &s;oon.&mdash;So now we only piddle at loo, quinze, pharo, vingt et un.</P>
<P>Lady De&s;mond never plays, and I think &s;he begins to look coldly on her female friend; but while Sir James's warmth continues, her lady&s;hip's fri|gidity is of &s;mall con&s;equence.&mdash;The only end it can an&s;wer, will be to di&s;|gu&s;t her hu&s;band; for &s;he is too timid to oppo&s;e him; and our fair ally is not of a humour to be ea&s;ily di&s;cou|raged
<PB N="250" REF="260">
where either her plea&s;ure or pro|fit is concerned.</P>
<P>I rejoice to hear that Evelyn is gone to Ireland; I was devili&s;hly afraid he would have come athwart us.&mdash;I made him believe I had left off play, and I mu&s;t have looked &s;illy if he had found me at it.&mdash;I wi&s;h we were as fairly rid of Stanley.&mdash;I can't bear that man;&mdash;I don't know why, but I &s;hrink before him, and yet I am no coward, Jack.&mdash;A man &s;hould have courage that plays all the game, and yet not affect the bully either.&mdash;I have &s;een you much too hot upon &s;ome occa&s;ions.&mdash;But I hope that hu|mour was pretty well <HI>corrected</HI> by your Iri&s;h expedition.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you joy of your lordly na|bob:&mdash;he is a prize, indeed!&mdash;Stick
<PB N="251" REF="261">
to him like a leech, Jack, for there can be no &s;in in robbing tho&s;e who have robbed others.&mdash;'Tis every ho|ne&s;t man's duty to recover &s;tolen goods from a thief, though he had no original claim to the property.&mdash;Go on and pro&s;per then.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHARLES EVELYN, TO MRS. STANLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bath.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not words to expre&s;s the pain I have &s;uffered from your la&s;t letter.&mdash;"Her health and &s;pirits decline vi&s;ibly&mdash;A cruel &s;omething preys upon her heart."</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="263">
O Lucy! how could you write tho&s;e words, and not efface them with your tears?&mdash;I thought I had already experienced every &s;pecies of angui&s;h that could be inflicted by di&s;appointed love.&mdash;From re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s to the dear cau&s;e of all my &s;ufferings, I had brought my humbled mind to &s;uch a &s;tate of acquie&s;cence, as to for|bear complaining.&mdash;Nay I am per|&s;uaded I could, without repining, have endured to &s;ee her married to the object of her choice.&mdash;But to know &s;he is unhappy mu&s;t render me &s;o be|yond a hope of cure.&mdash;I have been long labouring to con&s;ider this idol of my heart as mi&s;ers do their hidden trea&s;ure; though hopele&s;s of enjoying it, yet while I thought 'twas &s;afe, I could not look upon my&s;elf undone.&mdash;Now I am robbed of my ideal wealth, and am left poor indeed.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="264">
O Lucy, if you ever loved me, &s;trive, I conjure you, to a&s;&s;uage her gentle &s;orrows, and pour the balm of friend|&s;hip on her wounded heart! Gracious heaven! what can the affliction be that thus oppre&s;&s;es her mild &s;pirits? Would I could bear it for her, and ea&s;e her troubled brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Perhaps this place, or Bri&s;tol, might be of &s;ervice to her health; perhaps 'tis that alone which is impaired, and the now coming &s;pring may with its vernal breezes bring back health to her, and happine&s;s to me.&mdash;Compara|tive happine&s;s, I mean, for I have long been wretched, but never was completely &s;o till now.</P>
<P>Let Lady Juliana know that I &s;hall quit this place immediately.&mdash;You
<PB N="255" REF="265">
know that I intended it before, but if I had not, nothing on earth &s;hould now detain me here, I would fly to the Antipodes to leave it free for her. Surely my fate is &s;ingularly &s;evere, that thus impels me to a voluntary bani&s;hment from every place, in which my happine&s;s is centered.</P>
<P>I cannot, Lucy, enter into your raillery in regard to Mi&s;s Harley; I do not think her amiable; but were &s;he all that cou'd attract, "Envy in woman, or de&s;ire in man," her charms wou'd be intirely lo&s;t on me.&mdash;My eyes are clo&s;ed to beauty; I only feel its power, when I turn them inward, and gaze upon the image in my heart.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to hear that Madam Du Pont, is &s;o intimate with Emma,
<PB N="256" REF="266">
tho' I am certain it will never be in her power to pervert her principles, or render her heart callous; yet, from the hint you give, and my own ob&s;ervation, I by no means think her an eligible companion for my &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;A female mind cannot have too much delicacy, provided that it does not degenerate into affectation.&mdash;A gro&s;s or boi&s;terous woman is an unnatural character, and were I married, I had much rather my wife &s;hould conver&s;e with men than mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>The freedom that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between female friends, renders the conver&s;a|tion of &s;uch a per&s;on as I have men|tioned, infinitely more dangerous, than that of a male-libertine.&mdash;A woman ea&s;ily &s;ees thro' his de&s;igns, and may, if &s;he plea&s;es, be on her
<PB N="257" REF="267">
guard again&s;t them.&mdash;While the in|&s;iduous companion of her private hours; without alarming, &s;aps the foundation of her every virtue.</P>
<P>But grant they &s;hould be fixed, and are impregnable, will not the tainted gale, by often pa&s;&s;ing o'er the beau|teous flower, tarni&s;h its lu&s;tre, abate its fragrant &s;cent, take off its poli&s;h, and fade its blooming tints. As cha&s;te, as delicate, believe me Lucy, as the opening ro&s;e, &s;hou'd be the female heart.</P>
<P>Not even the pre&s;ent anxiety of my mind can render me indifferent to the happine&s;s of one with whom I am &s;o tenderly connected, as Lady De&s;mond.&mdash;Read the above pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="258" REF="268">
to her, and I am certain &s;he will want no further caution.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;et out for Ireland to-mor|row.&mdash;Remember my &s;i&s;ter, tho' &s;ure I need not urge your friend&s;hip, that the trea&s;ure of my heart is com|mitted to your care; and may your kind attention be rewarded with the re&s;toration of Lady Juliana's health and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ent my affections to our &s;i&s;ters, to yours and my Stanley, and write &s;oon, I intreat you, to your unhappy and affectionate brother,</P>
