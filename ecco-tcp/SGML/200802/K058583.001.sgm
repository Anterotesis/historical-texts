<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>WHO is he among the children of the earth, that repines at the power of the wicked? and who is he, that would change the lot of the righteous? He, who has appoint|ed to each his portion, is God; the Omni&s;cient and the Almighty, who fills eternity, and who&s;e exi&s;tence is
<PB N="2" REF="8">
from Him&s;elf! but he who murmurs, is man; who ye&s;terday was not, and who to-morrow &s;hall be forgotten: let him li&s;ten in &s;ilence to the voice of knowlege, and hide the blu&s;hes of con|fu&s;ion in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>Solyman, the mighty and the wi&s;e, who, in the one hundred and &s;econd year of the Hegyra, &s;at upon the throne of Per&s;ia, had two &s;ons, ALMORAN and HAMET, and they were twins. ALMORAN was the fir&s;t born, but Solyman divided his affection equally between them: they were both lodged in the &s;ame part of the &s;eraglio, both were attended by the &s;ame &s;ervants, and both received in&s;tructions from the &s;ame teacher.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9">
One of the fir&s;t things that ALMO|RAN learnt, was the prerogative of his birth; and he was taught very early to &s;et a high value upon it, by the terms in which tho&s;e about him ex|pre&s;&s;ed their &s;en&s;e of the power, the &s;plendor, and the delights of royalty. As his mind gradually opened, he na|turally con&s;idered the&s;e as the objects of univer&s;al de&s;ire, and the means of &s;upreme felicity: he was often re|minded, that the time was coming, when the &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;overeign power would enable him to fulfil all his wi&s;hes, to determine the fate of dependent nations with a nod, and di&s;|pen&s;e life and death, and happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, at his will: he was flattered by tho&s;e who hoped to draw wealth and dignity from his favour; and intere&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="10">
prompted all who approached him, to admini&s;ter to his plea&s;ures with a zeal and a&s;&s;iduity, which had the appear|ance of reverence to his merit, and af|fection to his per&s;on.</P>
<P>HAMET, on the contrary, &s;oon be|came &s;en&s;ible of a &s;ubordinate &s;tation: he was not, indeed, neglected; but he was not much care&s;&s;ed. When the gratification of HAMET came in com|petition with that of ALMORAN, he was always obliged to give it up, ex|cept when Solyman interpo&s;ed: his mind was, therefore, naturally led to &s;eek for happine&s;s in objects very dif|ferent from tho&s;e which had fixed the attention of ALMORAN. As he knew not to how narrow a &s;phere caprice or jealou&s;y might confine him, he
<PB N="5" REF="11">
con&s;idered what plea&s;ures were lea&s;t dependent upon external advantages; and as the fir&s;t popular commotion which &s;hould happen after his brother's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, might proba|bly co&s;t him his life, he was very in|qui&s;itive about the &s;tate into which his &s;pirit would be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the Angel of Death, and very diligent to do whatever might &s;ecure him a &s;hare of the permanent and unchangeable fe|licity of Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>This difference in the &s;ituation of ALMORAN and HAMET, produced great di&s;&s;imilarity in their di&s;po&s;itions, habits, and characters; to which, per|haps, nature might al&s;o in &s;ome de|gree contribute. ALMORAN was haughty, vain, and voluptuous; HA|MET
<PB N="6" REF="12">
was gentle, courteous, and tempe|rate: ALMORAN was volatile, impetu|ous, and ira&s;cible; HAMET was thought|ful, patient, and forbearing. Upon the heart of HAMET al&s;o were writ|ten the in&s;tructions of the Prophet; to his mind futurity was pre&s;ent by habi|tual anticipation; his plea&s;ure, his pain, his hopes, and his fears, were perpetually referred to the Invi&s;ible and Almighty Father of Life, by &s;en|timents of gratitude or re&s;ignation, complacency or confidence; &s;o that his devotion was not periodical but con&s;tant.</P>
<P>But the views of ALMORAN were terminated by nearer objects: his mind was perpetually bu&s;ied in the anticipa|tion of plea&s;ures and honours, which
<PB N="7" REF="13">
he &s;uppo&s;ed to be neither uncertain nor remote; the&s;e excited his hopes, with a power &s;ufficient to fix his attention; he did not look beyond them for other objects, nor enquire how enjoy|ments more di&s;tant were to be acquir|ed; and as he &s;uppo&s;ed the&s;e to be already &s;ecured to him by his birth, there was nothing he was &s;olicitous to obtain as the reward of merit, nor any thing that he con&s;idered him&s;elf to po&s;&s;e&s;s as the bounty of Heaven. If the &s;ublime and di&s;intere&s;ted recti|tude that produces and rewards it|&s;elf, dwells indeed with man, it dwelt not with ALMORAN: with re&s;pect to God, therefore, he was not impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e either of duty or depen|dence; he felt neither reverence nor love, gratitude nor re&s;ignation: in ab|&s;taining from evil, he was not intentio|nally
<PB N="8" REF="14">
good; he practi&s;ed the externals of morality without virtue, and performed the rituals of devotion without piety.</P>
<P>Such were ALMORAN and HAMET, when Solyman their father, full of days and full of honour, &s;lept in peace the &s;leep of death. With this event they were immediately acquainted. The emotions of ALMORAN were &s;uch as it was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal: the joy that he felt in &s;ecret was &s;o great, that the mere dread of di&s;appointment for a moment &s;u&s;pended his belief of what he heard: when his fears and his doubts gave way, his cheeks were &s;uf|fu&s;ed with &s;udden blu&s;hes, and his eyes &s;parkled with exultation and impati|ence: he looked eagerly about him, as if in ha&s;te to act; yet his looks were embarra&s;&s;ed, and his ge&s;tures irre&s;olute,
<PB N="9" REF="15">
becau&s;e he knew not what to do: he uttered &s;ome incoherent &s;entences, which di&s;covered at once the joy that he felt, and his &s;en&s;e of its impropriety; and his whole deportment expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t tumult and perturbation of mind.</P>
<P>Upon HAMET, the death of his fa|ther produced a very different effect: as &s;oon as he heard it, his lips trembled and his countenance grew pale; he &s;tood motionle&s;s a moment, like a pil|grim transfixed by lightning in the de|&s;ert; he then &s;mote his brea&s;t, and look|ing upward, his eyes by degrees over|flowed with tears, and they fell, like dew di&s;tilling from the mountain, in a calm and &s;ilent &s;hower. As his grief was thus mingled with devotion, his
<PB N="10" REF="16">
mind in a &s;hort time recovered its tranquillity, though not its chearfulne&s;s, and he de&s;ired to be conducted to his brother.</P>
<P>He found him &s;urrounded by the lords of his court, his eye &s;till re&s;tle&s;s and ardent, and his deportment elate and a&s;&s;uming. HAMET pre&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily through the circle, and pro&s;trated him|&s;elf before him: ALMORAN received the homage with a tumultuous plea&s;ure; but at length rai&s;ed him from the ground, and a&s;&s;ured him of his protec|tion, though without any expre&s;&s;ions either of kindne&s;s or of &s;orrow: <Q>HA|MET,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>if I have no cau&s;e to complain of you as a &s;ubject, you &s;hall have no cau&s;e to complain of me as a king.</Q> HAMET, who&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="17">
heart was again pierced by the cold and di&s;tant behaviour of his brother, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the &s;igh that &s;truggled in his bo&s;om, and &s;ecretly wiped away the tear that &s;tarted to his eye: he retired, with his looks fixed upon the ground, to a remote corner of the apartment; and though his heart yearned to em|brace his brother, his mode&s;t diffidence re&s;trained him from intruding upon the king.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation were ALMORAN and HAMET, when OMAR entered the a|partment. OMAR, upon who&s;e head the hand of time became heavy, had from his youth acquainted him&s;elf with wi&s;dom: to him nature had revealed her&s;elf in the &s;ilence of the night, when his lamp was burning alone, and his
<PB N="12" REF="18">
eyes only were open: to him was known the power of the Seal of Solo|mon; and to him the knowlege of things invi&s;ible had been revealed. Nor was the virtue of OMAR inferior to his knowlege; his heart was a fountain of good, which though it flowed through innumerable &s;treams was never dry: yet was the virtue of OMAR cloathed with humility; and he was &s;till pre&s;&s;ing nearer to perfection, by a devotion which though elevated was rational, and though regular was warm. From the council of OMAR, Solyman had de|rived glory and &s;trength; and to him he had committed the education of his children.</P>
<P>When he entered the apartment, the croud, touched at once with reverence
<PB N="13" REF="19">
and love, drew back; every eye was ca&s;t downward, and every tongue was &s;ilent. The full of days approached the king, and kneeling before him he put into his hand a &s;ealed paper: the king received it with impatience, &s;ee|ing it &s;uper&s;cribed with the hand of his father; and OMAR looking round, and perceiving HAMET, beckoned him to come forward. HAMET, who&s;e obedience to OMAR had been &s;o long habitual that it was now almo&s;t &s;pon|taneous, in&s;tantly drew near, though with a &s;low and irre&s;olute pace; and ALMORAN, having broken the &s;eal of the paper, began to read it to him&s;elf, with a look that expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t anxiety and impatience. OMAR kept his eye fixed upon him, and &s;oon perceived that his countenance was disfigured by
<PB N="14" REF="20">
confu&s;ion and trouble, and that he &s;eemed preparing to put up the paper in his bo&s;om: he then produced an|other paper from under his robe, and gave it to HAMET: 'This,' &s;ays he, <Q>is a copy of the will of Solyman, your father; the original is in the hand of ALMORAN: read it, and you will find that he has bequeathed his kingdom between you.</Q></P>
<P>The eyes of all pre&s;ent were now turned upon HAMET, who &s;tood &s;ilent and motionle&s;s with amazement, but was &s;oon rou&s;ed to attention by the ho|mage that was paid him. In the mean time, ALMORAN'S confu&s;ion increa&s;ed every moment: his di&s;appointment was aggravated by the &s;udden attention of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent to his bro|ther;
<PB N="15" REF="21">
and his jealou&s;y made him think him&s;elf neglected, while tho&s;e acts of duty were performed to HAMET, which were now known to be his right, and which he had him&s;elf received before him.</P>
<P>HAMET, however, regarded but lit|tle what &s;o much excited the envy of ALMORAN; his mind was employed upon &s;uperior objects, and agitated by nobler pa&s;&s;ions: the coldne&s;s of his brother's behaviour, though it had grieved had not quenched his affection; and as he was now no longer re&s;trained by the deference due from a &s;ubject to his king, he ran to him, and catching him to his brea&s;t attempted to &s;peak; but his heart was too full, and he could expre&s;s his affection and joy only by
<PB N="16" REF="22">
his tears. ALMORAN rather &s;uffered than received the embrace; and after a few ceremonies, to which neither of them could much attend, they retired to &s;eparate apartments.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="17" REF="23">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN ALMORAN was alone, he immediately locked the door; and throwing him&s;elf upon a &s;ofa in an agony of vexation and di&s;|apointment, of which he was unwil|ling there &s;hould be any witne&s;s, he re|volved in his mind all the plea&s;ures and honours of &s;upreme dominion which had now &s;uddenly been &s;natched from him, with a degree of angui&s;h and regret, not proportioned to their real, but their imaginary value. Of future good, that which we obtain is found to be le&s;s than our expecta|tions; but that of which we are di&s;ap|pointed, we &s;uppo&s;e would have been more: thus do the children of hope
<PB N="18" REF="24">
extract evil, both from what they gain, and from what they lo&s;e. But ALMORAN, after the fir&s;t tumult of his mind had &s;ub&s;ided, began to con|&s;ider as well what was left him, as what had been taken away. He was &s;till without a &s;uperior, though he had an equal; he was &s;till a king, though he did not govern alone: and with re|&s;pect to every individual in his domini|ons, except one, his will would now be a law; though with re&s;pect to the public, the concurrence of his brother would be nece&s;&s;ary to give it force. 'Let me then,' &s;ays he, <Q>make the mo&s;t of the power that is now put into my hand, and wait till &s;ome fa|vourable opportunity &s;hall offer to increa&s;e it. Let me di&s;&s;emble my jealou&s;y and di&s;appointment, that I
<PB N="19" REF="25">
may not alarm &s;u&s;picion, or put the virtues of HAMET upon their guard again&s;t me; and let me contrive to give our joint admini&s;tration &s;uch a form, as may be&s;t favour my de|&s;ign.</Q></P>
<P>Such were the reflections, with which ALMORAN &s;oothed the angui&s;h of his mind; while HAMET was bu|&s;ied in &s;peculations of a very different kind. If he was plea&s;ed at reflecting, that he was rai&s;ed from a &s;ubject to a prince; he was plea&s;ed &s;till more, when he con&s;idered his elevation as a te&s;t of his father's affection to his per&s;on, and approbation of his conduct: he was al&s;o delighted with the thought, that his brother was a&s;&s;ociated with him in the arduous ta&s;k which he was
<PB N="20" REF="26">
now called to perform. <Q>If I had been appointed to govern alone,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I &s;hould have had no equal; and he who has no equal, though he may have faithful &s;ervants, can have no friend: there cannot be that union of intere&s;ts, that equal participation of good, that unre&s;trained inter|cour&s;e of mind, and that mutual dependence, which con&s;titutes the pure and exalted happine&s;s of friend|&s;hip. With ALMORAN, I &s;hall &s;hare the &s;upreme delight of wre&s;t|ing the innocent and the helple&s;s from the iron hand of oppre&s;&s;ion; of animating merit by reward, and re|&s;training the unworthy by fear: I &s;hall &s;hare, with ALMORAN, the plea&s;ures of governing a numerous, a powerful, and a happy people;
<PB N="21" REF="27">
plea&s;ures which, however great, are, like all others, increa&s;ed by partici|pation.</Q></P>
<P>While HAMET was thus enjoying the happine&s;s, which his virtue derived from the &s;ame &s;ource, from which the vices of ALMORAN had filled his brea&s;t with angui&s;h and di&s;content; OMAR was contriving in what manner their joint government could be&s;t be carried into execution.</P>
<P>He knew that Solyman, having con&s;idered the di&s;po&s;itions of his &s;ons, was of opinion, that if they had been blended in one per&s;on, they would have produced a character more fit to go|vern in his &s;tead, than either of them alone: ALMORAN, he thought, was
<PB N="22" REF="28">
too volatile and warm; but he &s;u&s;pect|ed, that HAMET would &s;ink into inacti|vity for want of &s;pirit: he feared alike ALMORAN's love of enterprize, and HAMET's fondne&s;s for retirement: he ob&s;erved, in HAMET, a placid ea&s;ine&s;s of temper, which might &s;uffer the reins of government to lie too loo&s;e; and, in ALMORAN, a quickne&s;s of re|&s;entment, and jealou&s;y of command, which might hold them too tight: he hoped, therefore, that by leaving them a joint dominion, he &s;hould blend their di&s;po&s;itions, at lea&s;t in their effects, in every act of government that &s;hould take place; or that, however they &s;hould agree to admini&s;ter their go|vernment, the public would derive be|nefit from the virtues of both, with|out danger of &s;uffering from their im|perfections,
<PB N="23" REF="29">
as their imperfections would only operate again&s;t each other, while, in whatever was right, their minds would naturally concur, as the coincidence of rectitude with recti|tude is nece&s;&s;ary and eternal. But he did not con&s;ider, that different di&s;po|&s;itions operating &s;eparately upon two different wills, would appear in effects very unlike tho&s;e, which they would concur to produce in one: that two wills, under the direction of di&s;po&s;i|tions &s;o different, would &s;eldom be brought to coincide; and that more mi&s;chiefs would probably ari&s;e from the conte&s;t, than from the imperfec|tions of either alone.</P>
<P>But Solyman had &s;o long applauded him&s;elf for his project before he re|vealed
<PB N="24" REF="30">
it to OMAR, that OMAR found him too much di&s;plea&s;ed with any ob|jection, to con&s;ider its weight: and knowing that peculiar notions are more rarely given up, than opinions received from others, and made our own only by adoption, he at length acquie&s;ced, le&s;t he &s;hould by farther oppo&s;ition lo&s;e his influence, which on other occa&s;ions he might &s;till employ to the advantage of the public; and took a &s;olemn oath, that he would, as far as was in his power, &s;ee the will carried into execu|tion.</P>
<P>To this, indeed, he con&s;ented with|out much reluctance, as he had little le&s;s rea&s;on to fear the &s;ole government of ALMORAN, than a joint admini&s;tra|tion; and if a &s;truggle for &s;uperiority
<PB N="25" REF="31">
&s;hould happen, he hoped the virtues of HAMET would obtain the &s;uffrages of the people in his favour, and e&s;tabli&s;h him upon the throne alone. But as change is it&s;elf an evil, and as changes in government are &s;eldom produced without great confu&s;ion and calamity, he applied him&s;elf to con&s;ider in what manner the government of ALMORAN and HAMET could be admini&s;tered, &s;o as mo&s;t effectually to blend their cha|racters in their admini&s;tration, and prevent the conduct of one from excit|ing jealou&s;y in the other.</P>
<P>After much thought, he determined that a &s;y&s;tem of laws &s;hould be pre|pared, which the &s;ons of Solyman &s;hould examine and alter till they per|fectly approved, and to which they
<PB N="26" REF="32">
&s;hould then give the &s;anction of their joint authority: that when any addition or alteration &s;hould be thought nece&s;|&s;ary, it &s;hould be made in the &s;ame manner; and that when any in&s;uper|able difference of &s;entiment happened, either in this or in any act of preroga|tive independent of the laws for regu|lating the manners of the people, the kings &s;hould refer it to &s;ome per&s;on of approved integrity and wi&s;dom, and abide by his determination. OMAR ea&s;ily fore&s;aw, that when the opinion of ALMORAN and HAMET &s;hould differ, the opinion of ALMORAN would be e&s;tabli&s;hed; for there were many cau&s;es that would render ALMORAN inflexible, and HAMET yielding: AL|MORAN was naturally confident and a&s;&s;uming, HAMET diffident and mo|de&s;t;
<PB N="27" REF="33">
ALMORAN was impatient of con|tradiction, HAMET was attentive to argument, and &s;olicitous only for the di&s;covery of truth. ALMORAN al&s;o conceived, that by the will of his father, he had &s;uffered wrong; HA|MET, that he had received a favour: ALMORAN, therefore, was di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;ent the fir&s;t appearance of oppo&s;i|tion; and HAMET, on the contrary, to acquie&s;ce, as in his &s;hare of go|vernment, whatever it might be, he had more than was his right by birth, and his brother had le&s;s. Thus, therefore, the will of ALMORAN would probably predominate in the &s;tate: but as the &s;ame cau&s;e which conferred this &s;uperiority, would often prevent contention, OMAR con&s;idered
<PB N="28" REF="34">
it, upon the whole, rather as good than evil.</P>
<P>When he had prepared his plan, therefore, he &s;ent a copy of it, by different me&s;&s;engers at the &s;ame time, both to ALMORAN and HAMET, in|clo&s;ed in a letter, in which he expre&s;t his &s;en&s;e of obligation to their father, and his zeal and affection for them: he mentioned the promi&s;e he had made, to devote him&s;elf to their &s;ervice; and the oath he had taken, to pro|po&s;e whatever he thought might fa|cilitate the accompli&s;hment of their father's de&s;ign, with honour to them and happine&s;s to their people: the&s;e motives, which he could not re&s;i&s;t without impiety, he hoped
<PB N="29" REF="35">
would ab&s;olve him from pre&s;ump|tion; and tru&s;ting in the rectitude of his intentions, he left the i&s;&s;ue to God.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="30" REF="36">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>THE receipt of this letter threw ALMORAN into another agony of indignation: he felt again the lo&s;s of his prerogative; the offer of ad|vice he di&s;dained as an in&s;ult, to which he had been injuriou&s;ly &s;ubjected by the will of his father; and he was di&s;|po&s;ed to reject whatever was &s;ugge&s;ted by OMAR, even before his propo&s;al was known. With this temper of mind he began to read, and at every paragraph took new offence; he deter|mined, however, not to admit OMAR to the honour of a conference upon the &s;ubject, but to &s;ettle a plan of government with his brother, without the lea&s;t regard to his advice.</P>

A &s;upercilious attention to minute formalities, is a certain indication of a little mind, con&s;cious to the want of innate dignity, and &s;olicitous to de|rive from others what it cannot &s;upply to it&s;elf: as the &s;crupulous exaction of every trifling tribute di&s;covers the weakne&s;s of the tyrant, who fears his claim &s;hould be di&s;puted; while the prince, who is con&s;cious of &s;uperior and indi&s;putable power, and knows that the &s;tates he has &s;ubjugated do not dare to revolt, &s;carce enquires whether &s;uch te&s;timonies of allegiance are given or not.</P>
<P>Thus, the jealou&s;y of ALMORAN already en&s;laved him to the punctilios of &s;tate; and the mo&s;t trifling circum|&s;tances involved him in perplexity,
<PB N="32" REF="38">
or fired him with re&s;entment: the friend&s;hip and fidelity of OMAR &s;tung him with rage, as in&s;olent and intru|&s;ive; and though it determined him to an immediate interview with his bro|ther, yet he was embarra&s;&s;ed how to procure it. At fir&s;t he ro&s;e, and was about to go to him; but he &s;topped &s;hort with di&s;dain, upon reflecting, that it was an act of conde&s;cen&s;ion which might be deemed an acknow|ledgement of &s;uperiority: he then thought of &s;ending for HAMET to come to him; but this he feared might pro|voke him, as implying a denial of his equality: at length he determined to propo&s;e a meeting in the chamber of council, and was ju&s;t di&s;patching an officer with the me&s;&s;age, when HA|MET entered the apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="39">
The countenance of HAMET was flu&s;hed with joy, and his heart was warmed with the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations of affection and confidence, by the &s;ame letter, from which ALMORAN had ex|tracted the bitterne&s;s of jealou&s;y and re&s;entment; and as he had no idea that an act of courte&s;y to his brother could derogate from his own dignity or importance, he indulged the hone&s;t impatience of his heart to communi|cate the plea&s;ure with which it over|flowed: he was, indeed, &s;omewhat di&s;appointed, to find no traces of &s;atis|faction in the countenance of ALMO|RAN, when he &s;aw the &s;ame paper in his hand, which had impre&s;&s;ed &s;o much upon his own.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="40">
He waited &s;ome time after the fir&s;t &s;alutations, without mentioning the &s;cheme of government he was come to concert; becau&s;e having ob&s;erved that ALMORAN was embarra&s;&s;ed and di&s;|plea&s;ed, he expected that he would communicate the cau&s;e, and plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the hope that he might remove it: finding, however, that this expectation was di&s;appointed, he ad|dre&s;&s;ed him to this effect:</P>
<P><Q>How happy are we, my dear bro|ther, in the wi&s;dom and fidelity of OMAR! how excellent is the &s;y&s;tem of government that he has propo&s;ed! how ea&s;y and honourable will it be to us that govern, and how advantage|ous to the people that obey!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="41">
'The advantages,' &s;aid ALMO|RAN, <Q>which you &s;eem to have di&s;co|vered, are not evident to me: tell me, then, what you imagine they are, and I will afterwards give you my opinion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;y&s;tem of laws as the rule of government,</Q> &s;aid HA|MET, <Q>many evils will be avoided, and many benefits procured. If the law is the will only of the &s;overeign, it can never certainly be known to the peo|ple: many, therefore, may violate that rule of right, which the hand of the Almighty has written upon the living tablets of the heart, in the pre|&s;umptuous hope, that it will not &s;ub|ject them to puni&s;hment; and tho&s;e, by whom that rule is fulfilled, will
<PB N="36" REF="42">
not enjoy that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ecu|rity, which they would derive from the protection of a pre&s;cribed law, which they have never broken. Nei|ther will tho&s;e who are inclined to do evil, be equally re&s;trined by the fear of puni&s;hment; if neither the offence is a&s;certained, nor the puni&s;h|ment pre&s;cribed. One motive to pro|bity, therefore, will be wanting; which ought to be &s;upplied, as well for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who may be tempted to offend, as of tho&s;e who may &s;uffer by the offence. Be&s;ides, he who governs not by a written and a public law, mu&s;t either admini&s;ter that government in per&s;on, or by others: if in per&s;on, he will &s;ink under a labour which no man is able to &s;u&s;tain; and if by others, the in|feriority
<PB N="37" REF="43">
of their rank mu&s;t &s;ubject them to temptations which it cannot be hoped they will always re&s;i&s;t, and to prejudices which it will perhaps be impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;urmount. But to admini&s;ter government by a law which a&s;certains the offence, and directs the puni&s;hment, integrity alone will be &s;ufficient; and as the perver&s;ion of ju&s;tice will in this ca&s;e be notorious, and depend not upon opinion but fact, it will &s;eldom be practi&s;ed, becau&s;e it will be ea&s;ily pu|ni&s;hed.</Q></P>
<P>ALMORAN, who had heard the opi|nions of HAMET with impatience and &s;corn, now &s;tarted from his &s;eat with a proud and contemptuous a&s;pect: he fir&s;t glanced his eyes upon his brother;
<PB N="38" REF="44">
and then looking di&s;dainfully down|ward, he threw back his robe, and &s;tretching out his hand from him, <Q>Shall the &s;on of Solyman,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>upon who&s;e will the fate of nations was &s;u&s;|pended, who&s;e &s;miles and frowns were alone the criterions of right and wrong, before whom the voice of wi&s;dom it&s;elf was &s;ilent, and the pride even of virtue humbled in the du&s;t; &s;hall the &s;on of Solyman be harne&s;&s;ed, like a mule, in the tram|mels of law? &s;hall he become a mere in&s;trument to execute what o|thers have devi&s;ed? &s;hall he only de|clare the determinations of a &s;tatute, and &s;hall his ear be affronted by claims of right? It is the glory of a prince, to puni&s;h for what and whom he will; to be the &s;overeign, not only of pro|perty,
<PB N="39" REF="45">
but of life; and to govern alike without pre&s;cription or ap|peal.</Q></P>
<P>HAMET, who was &s;truck with a&s;to|ni&s;hment at this declaration, and the vehemence with which it was uttered, after a &s;hort recollection made this re|ply: <Q>It is the glory of a prince, to govern others, as he is governed by Him, who is alone mo&s;t merciful and almighty! It is his glory to prevent crimes, rather than to di&s;play his pow|er in puni&s;hment; to diffu&s;e happi|ne&s;s, rather than inforce &s;ubjection; and rather to animate with love, than depre&s;s by fear. Has not He that &s;hall judge us, given us a rule of life by which we &s;hall be judged? is not our reward and puni&s;hment al|ready
<PB N="40" REF="46">
&s;et before us? are not His pro|mi&s;es and threatenings, motives to obedience? and have we not confi|dence and joy, when we have obeyed? To God, His own divine perfections are a law; and the&s;e He has tran&s;cribed as a law to us. Let us, then, govern, as we are governed; let us &s;eek our happine&s;s in the happine&s;s that we be|&s;tow, and our honour in emulating the benevolence of Heaven.</Q></P>
<P>As ALMORAN feared, that to pro|ceed farther in this argument would too far di&s;clo&s;e his &s;entiments, and put HAMET too much upon his guard; he determined for the pre&s;ent to di&s;&s;emble: and as he perceived, that HAMET's opi|nion, and an admini&s;tration founded up|on it, would render him extreamly po|pular,
<PB N="41" REF="47">
and at length po&s;&s;ibly e&s;tabli&s;h him alone; he was now &s;olicitous only to withdraw him from public notice, and per&s;uade him to leave the govern|ment, whatever form it &s;hould receive, to be admini&s;tered by others: return|ing, therefore, to his &s;eat, and a&s;&s;um|ing an appearance of complacence and tranquillity, with which he could not form his language perfectly to agree; 'Let us then,' &s;aid he, <Q>if a law mu&s;t be &s;et up in our &s;tead, leave the law to be executed by our &s;laves: and as nothing will be left for us to do, that is worthy of us, let us de|vote our&s;elves to the plea&s;ures of ea&s;e; and if there are any enjoy|ments peculiar to royalty, let us &s;e|cure them as our only di&s;tinction from the multitude.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="48">
'Not &s;o,' &s;ays HAMET; <Q>for there is yet much for a prince to do, after the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of laws has been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed: the government of a nation as a whole, the regulation and extent of its trade, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of ma|nufactories, the encouragement of genius, the application of the reve|nues, and whatever can improve the arts of peace, and &s;ecure &s;uperiority in war, is the proper object of a king's attention.</Q></P>
<P>'But in the&s;e,' &s;aid ALMORAN, <Q>it will be difficult for two minds to concur; let us, then, agree to leave the&s;e al&s;o to the care of &s;ome other, whom we can continue as long as we approve, and di&s;place when we
<PB N="43" REF="49">
approve no longer: we &s;hall, by this expedient, be able to avert the odium of any unpopular mea|&s;ure; and by the &s;acrifice of a &s;lave, we can always &s;atisfy the people, and &s;ilence public di&s;con|tent.</Q></P>
<P>'To tru&s;t implicitly to another,' &s;ays HAMET, <Q>is to give up a prero|gative, which is at once our highe&s;t duty and intere&s;t to keep; it is to be|tray our tru&s;t, and to &s;acrifice our ho|nour to another. The prince, who leaves the government of his people implicitly to a &s;ubject, leaves it to one, who has many more temptati|ons to betray their intere&s;t than him|&s;elf: a vicegerent is in a &s;ubordinate
<PB N="44" REF="50">
&s;tation; he has, therefore, much to fear, and much to hope: he may al&s;o acquire the power of obtaining what he hopes, and averting what he fears, at the public expence; he may &s;tand in need of dependents, and may be able no otherwi&s;e to procure them, than by conniving at the fraud or the violence which they commit: he may receive, in bribes, an equivalent for his &s;hare, as an individual, in the public pro&s;perity; for his intere&s;t is not e&s;&s;entially connected with that of the &s;tate; he has a &s;eparate intere&s;t; but the intere&s;t of the &s;tate, and of the king, are one: he may even be corrupted to betray the councils, and give up the intere&s;ts of the nation, to a foreign power; but this is im|po&s;&s;ible to the king; for nothing
<PB N="45" REF="51">
equivalent to what he would give up, could be offered him. But as a king has not equal temptations to do wrong, neither is he equally expo&s;ed to oppo&s;ition, when he does right: the mea&s;ures of a &s;ub&s;titute are fre|quently oppo&s;ed, merely from inte|re&s;t; becau&s;e the leader of a faction again&s;t him, hopes, that if he can re|move him by popular clamour, he &s;hall &s;ucceed to his power; but it can be no man's intere&s;t to oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures of a king, if his mea|&s;ures are good, becau&s;e no man can hope to &s;upplant him. Are not the&s;e the precepts of the Prophet, who&s;e wi&s;|dom was from above?</Q> <Q>&mdash;Let not the eye of expectation be rai&s;ed to another, for that which thy&s;elf only &s;hould be&s;tow: &s;uffer not thy own
<PB N="46" REF="52">
&s;hadow to ob&s;cure thee; nor be con|tent to derive that glory, which it is thy prerogative to impart.</Q></P>
<P>'But is the prince,' &s;aid ALMORAN, <Q>always the wi&s;e&s;t man in his domini|ons? Can we not find, in another, abilities and experience, which we do not po&s;&s;e&s;s? and is it not the duty of him who pre&s;ides in the &s;hip, to, place the helm in that hand which can be&s;t &s;teer it?</Q></P>
<P>'A prince,' &s;aid HAMET, <Q>who &s;in|cerely intends the good of his people, can &s;carce fail to effect it; all the wi&s;|dom of the nation will be at once turned to that object: whatever is his prin|cipal aim, will be that of all who are admitted to his council; for to con|cur

with his principal aim, mu&s;t be the &s;ure&s;t recommendation to his fa|vour. Let us, then, hear others; but let us act our&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>As ALMORAN now perceived, that the longer this conver&s;ation continued, the more he &s;hould be embarra&s;&s;ed; he put an end to it, by appearing to acquie&s;ce in what HAMET had propo&s;ed. HAMET withdrew, charm|ed with the candour and flexibility which he imagined he had di&s;co|vered in his brother; and not with|out &s;ome exultation in his own rhe|toric, which he &s;uppo&s;ed had gained no incon&s;iderable victory. ALMORAN, in the mean time, applauded him&s;elf for having thus far practi&s;ed the arts of

di&s;&s;imulation with &s;ucce&s;s; fortified him&s;elf in the re&s;olutions he had be|fore taken; and conceived new male|volence and jealou&s;y again&s;t HAMET.</P>

<P>WHILE HAMET was exulting in his conque&s;t, and his heart was overflowing at once with &s;elf-com|placency, and affection to his brother; he was told, that OMAR was waiting without, and de&s;ired admittance. HA|MET ordered that he &s;hould be imme|diately introduced; and when OMAR entered, and would have pro&s;trated him&s;elf before him, he catched him in his arms in a tran&s;port of affection and e&s;teem; and having ordered that none &s;hould interrupt them, compelled him to &s;it down on a &s;ofa.</P>
<P>He then related, with all the joy of a youthful and an ardent mind, the
<PB N="50" REF="56">
conver&s;ation he had had with ALMO|RAN, intermixed with expre&s;&s;ions of the highe&s;t prai&s;e and the mo&s;t cordial e&s;teem. OMAR was not without &s;u&s;pi|cion, that the &s;entiments which ALMO|RAN had fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch ve|hemence of pa&s;&s;ion, were &s;till predo|minant in his mind: but of the&s;e &s;u&s;|picious he did not give the lea&s;t hint to HAMET; not only becau&s;e to commu|nicate &s;u&s;picions is to accu&s;e without proof, but becau&s;e he did not think him&s;elf at liberty to make an ill report of another, though he knew it to be true. He approved the &s;entiments of HAMET, as they had indeed been in|fu&s;ed by his own in&s;tructions; and &s;ome precepts and cautions were now added, which the acce&s;&s;ion of HAMET
<PB N="51" REF="57">
to a &s;hare of the imperial power made particularly nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>'Remember,' &s;aid OMAR, <Q>that the mo&s;t effectual way of promoting virtue, is to prevent occa&s;ions of vice. There are, perhaps, particular &s;itua|tions, in which human virtue has al|ways failed: at lea&s;t, temptation of|ten repeated, and long continued, has &s;eldom been finally re&s;i&s;ted. In a government &s;o con&s;tituted as to leave the people expo&s;ed to perpetual &s;e|duction, by opportunities of di&s;&s;olute plea&s;ure or iniquitous gain, the mul|tiplication of penal laws will only tend to depopulate the kingdom, and di&s;grace the &s;tate; to devote to the &s;cymitar and the bow-&s;tring, tho&s;e who might have been u&s;eful to &s;ociety,
<PB N="52" REF="58">
and to leave the re&s;t di&s;&s;olute turbu|lent and factious. If the &s;treets not only abound with women, who in|flame the pa&s;&s;enger by their appear|ance, their ge&s;ture, and their &s;olici|tations; but with hou&s;es, in which every de&s;ire which they kindle may be gratified with &s;ecrecy and conveni|ence;</Q> it is in vain that <Q>the feet of the pro&s;titute go down to death, and that her &s;teps take hold on hell:</Q> <Q>what then can be hoped from any puni&s;hment, which the laws of man can &s;uperadd to di&s;ea&s;e and want, to rottenne&s;s and perdition? If you permit opium to be publickly &s;old at a low rate; it will be folly to hope, that the dread of puni&s;hment will render idlene&s;s and drunkenne&s;s &s;tran|gers to the poor. If a tax is &s;o collect|ed,
<PB N="53" REF="59">
as to leave opportunities to pro|cure the commodity, without paying it; the hope of gain will always &s;ur|mount the fear of puni&s;hment. If, when the veteran has &s;erved you at the ri&s;que of life, you withold his hire; it will be in vain to threaten u&s;ury and extortion with impri&s;onment and fines. If, in your armies, you &s;uffer it to be any man's intere&s;t, rather to pre&s;erve the life of a hor&s;e than a man; be a&s;&s;ured, that your own &s;word is drawn for your enemy: for there will always be &s;ome, in whom intere&s;t is &s;tronger than humanity and honour. Put no man's intere&s;t, therefore, in the ballance again&s;t his duty; nor hope that good can often be produc|ed, but by preventing opportunities of evil.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="60">
To the&s;e precepts of OMAR, HA|MET li&s;tened as to the in&s;tructions of a father; and having promi&s;ed to keep them as the trea&s;ure of life, he di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed him from his pre&s;ence. The heart of HAMET was now expanded with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing expectations; but ALMORAN was pining with &s;olici|tude, jealou&s;y, and di&s;tru&s;t: he took every opportunity to avoid both OMAR and HAMET; but HAMET &s;till retain|ed his confidence, and OMAR his &s;u&s;|picions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time, the &s;y&s;tem of government was e&s;tabli&s;hed which had been propo&s;ed by OMAR, and in which HAMET concurred from princi|ple, and ALMORAN from policy. The views of ALMORAN terminated in the gratification of his own appetites and pa&s;&s;ions; tho&s;e of HAMET, in the di&s;|charge of his duty: HAMET, there|fore, was indefatigable in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate; and as his &s;en&s;e of honour, and his love of the public, made this the employment of his choice, it was to him the perpetual &s;ource of a gene|rous and &s;ublime felicity. ALMORAN
<PB N="56" REF="62">
al&s;o was equally diligent, but from another motive: he was actuated, not by love of the public, but by jealou&s;y of his brother; he performed his ta&s;k as the drudge of nece&s;&s;ity, with reluc|tance and ill will; &s;o that to him it produced pain and anxiety, wearine&s;s and impatience.</P>
<P>To atone for this wa&s;te of time, he determined to crowd all that remained with delight: his gardens were an epi|tome of all nature, and on his palace were exhau&s;ted all the trea&s;ures of art; his &s;eraglio was filled with beauties of every nation, and his table &s;upplied with dainties from the remote&s;t corners of his dominions. In the &s;ongs that were repeated in his pre&s;ence, he li&s;tened
<PB N="57" REF="63">
at once to the voice of adulation and mu&s;ic; he breathed the perfumes of Arabia, and he ta&s;ted the forbidden plea&s;ure of wine. But as every appe|tite is &s;oon &s;atiated by exce&s;s, his ea|gerne&s;s to accumulate plea&s;ure deprived him of enjoyment. Among the variety of beauty that &s;urrounded him, the pa&s;&s;ion, which, to be luxurious, mu&s;t be delicate and refined, was degraded to a mere in&s;tinct, and exhau&s;ted in endle&s;s di&s;&s;ipation; the care&s;s was un|endeared by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of recipro|cal delight, and was immediately &s;uc|ceeded by indifference or di&s;gu&s;t. By the dainties that perpetually urged him to intemperance, that appetite, which alone could make even dainties ta&s;teful, was de&s;troyed. The &s;plendor of his palace and the beauty of his gardens,
<PB N="58" REF="64">
became at length &s;o familiar to his eye, that they were frequently before him, without being &s;een. Even flattery and mu&s;ic lo&s;t their power, by too frequent a repetition: and the broken &s;lumbers of the night, and the languor of the morning, were more than equivalent to the tran&s;ient hilarity that was in|&s;pired by wine. Thus pa&s;&s;ed the time of ALMORAN, divided between pain|ful labours which he did not dare to &s;hun, and the &s;earch of plea&s;ure which he could never find.</P>
<P>HAMET, on the contrary, did not &s;eek plea&s;ure, but plea&s;ure &s;eemed to &s;eek him: he had a perpetual com|placence and &s;erenity of mind, which rendered him con&s;tantly &s;u&s;ceptible of plea&s;ing impre&s;&s;ions; every thing that
<PB N="59" REF="65">
was prepared to refre&s;h or entertain him in his &s;ea&s;ons of retirement and relaxation, added &s;omething to the de|light which was continually &s;pringing in his brea&s;t, when he reviewed the pa&s;t, or looked forward to the future. Thus, the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e were heightened by tho&s;e of his mind, and the plea&s;ures of the mind by tho&s;e of &s;en&s;e: he had, indeed, as yet no wife; for as yet no woman had fixed his at|tention, or determined his choice.</P>
<P>Among the amba&s;&s;adors whom the monarchs of A&s;ia &s;ent to congratulate the &s;ons of Solyman upon their acce&s;|&s;ion to the throne, there was a native of Circa&s;&s;ia, who&s;e name was Abdallah. Abdallah had only one child, a daugh|ter, in whom all his happine&s;s and af|fection
<PB N="60" REF="66">
centered; he was unwilling to leave her behind, and therefore brought her to the court of Per&s;ia. Her mo|ther died while &s;he was yet an infant; &s;he was now in the &s;ixteenth year of her age, and her name was ALMEIDA. She was beautiful as the daughters of Paradi&s;e, and gentle as the breezes of the &s;pring; her mind was without &s;tain, and her manners were without art.</P>
<P>She was lodged with her father in a palace that joined to the gardens of the &s;eraglio; and it happened that a lamp which had one night been left burning in a lower apartment, by &s;ome accident &s;et fire to the net-work of cotton that &s;urrounded a &s;opha, and the whole room was &s;oon after in a
<PB N="61" REF="67">
flame. ALMORAN, who had been pa&s;&s;ing the afternoon in riot and de|bauchery, had been removed from his banquetting room a&s;leep; but HAMET was &s;till in his clo&s;et, where he had been regulating &s;ome papers that were to be u&s;ed the next day. The windows of this room opened towards the inner apartments of the hou&s;e in which Ab|dallah re&s;ided; and HAMET, having by accident looked that way, was alarmed by the appearance of an un|u&s;ual light, and &s;tarting up to &s;ee whence it proceeded, he di&s;covered what had happened.</P>
<P>Having ha&s;tily ordered the guard of the night to a&s;&s;i&s;t in quenching the flame, and removing the furniture, he ran him&s;elf into the garden. As
<PB N="62" REF="68">
&s;oon as he was come up to the hou&s;e, he was alarmed by the &s;hrieks of a female voice; and the next moment, ALMEIDA appeared at the window of an apartment directly over that which was on fire. ALMEIDA he had till now never &s;een, nor did he &s;o much as know that Abdallah had a daughter: but though her per&s;on was unknown, he was &s;trongly intere&s;ted in her dan|ger, and called out to her to throw her&s;elf into his arms. At the &s;ound of his voice &s;he ran back into the room, &s;uch is the force of inviolate mode&s;ty, though the &s;moke was then ri&s;ing in curling &s;pires from the win|dows: &s;he was, however, &s;oon driven back; and part of the floor at the &s;ame in&s;tant giving way, &s;he wrapt
<PB N="63" REF="69">
her veil round her, and leaped into the garden. HAMET caught her in his arms; but though he broke her fall, he &s;unk down with her weight: he did not, however, quit his charge; but perceiving &s;he had fainted, he made ha&s;te with her into his apartment, to afford her &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as he could procure.</P>
<P>She was covered only with the light and loo&s;e robe in which &s;he &s;lept, and her veil had dropped off by the way. The moment he entered his clo&s;et, the light di&s;covered to him &s;uch beauty as before he had never &s;een: &s;he now began to revive; and before her &s;en&s;es returned, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed the prince with an involuntary embrace, which he returned by &s;training her clo&s;er to his

brea&s;t, in a tumult of delight, confu|&s;ion, and anxiety, which he could &s;carce &s;u&s;tain. As he &s;till held her in his arms, and gazed &s;ilently upon her, &s;he opened her eyes, and in&s;tantly re|linqui&s;hing her hold, &s;hrieked out, and threw her&s;elf from him. As there were no women nearer than that wing of the palace in which his brother re|&s;ided, and as he had many rea&s;ons not to leave her in their charge; he was in the utmo&s;t perplexity what to do. He a&s;&s;ured her, in &s;ome ha&s;ty and incoherent words, of her &s;ecurity; he told her, that &s;he was in the royal palace, and that he who had conveyed her thither was HAMET. The habi|tual reverence of &s;overeign power, now &s;urmounted all other pa&s;&s;ions in the bo&s;om of ALMEIDA: &s;he was in&s;tantly
<PB N="65" REF="71">
covered with new confu&s;ion; and hid|ing her face with her hands, threw her|&s;elf at his feet: he rai&s;ed her with a trepidation almo&s;t equal to her own, and endeavoured to &s;ooth her into con|fidence and tranquillity.</P>
<P>Hitherto her memory had been wholly &s;u&s;pended by violent pa&s;&s;ions, which had crowded upon her in a rapid and uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the fir&s;t gleam of recollection threw her into a new agony; and having been &s;ilent a few moments, &s;he &s;uddenly &s;mote her hands together, and bur&s;ting into tears, cried out, <Q>Abdallah! my father! my father!</Q>&mdash;HAMET not only knew but felt all the meaning of the exclamation, and immediately ran again into the garden: he had ad|vanced
<PB N="66" REF="72">
but a few paces, before he di&s;|cerned an old man &s;itting upon the ground, and looking upward in &s;ilent angui&s;h, as if he had exhau&s;ted the power of complaint. HAMET, upon a nearer approach, perceived by the light of the flame that it was Abdal|lah; and in&s;tantly calling him by his name, told him, that his daughter was &s;afe. At the name of his daughter, Abdallah &s;uddenly &s;tarted up, as if he had been rou&s;ed by the voice of an an|gel from the &s;leep of death: HAMET again repeated, that his daughter was in &s;afety; and Abdallah looking wi&s;t|fully at him, knew him to be the king. He was then &s;truck with an awe that re&s;trained him from enquiry: but HAMET directing him where he might find her, went forward, that he
<PB N="67" REF="73">
might not le&s;&s;en the plea&s;ure of their interview, nor re&s;train the fir&s;t tran|&s;ports of duty and affection by his pre&s;ence. He &s;oon met with other fugitives from the fire, which had opened a communication between the gardens and the &s;treet; and among them &s;ome women belonging to AL|MEIDA, whom he conducted him&s;elf to their mi&s;tre&s;s. He immediately al|lotted to her and to her father, an apartment in his divi&s;ion of the pa|lace; and the fire being now nearly extingui&s;hed, he retired to re&s;t.</P>

<P>THOUGH the night was far ad|vanced, yet the eyes of HAMET were &s;trangers to &s;leep: his fancy in|ce&s;&s;antly repeated the events that had ju&s;t happened; the image of ALMEIDA was ever before him; and his brea&s;t throbbed with a di&s;quietude, which, though it prevented re&s;t, he did not wi&s;h to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>ALMORAN, in the mean time, was &s;lumbering away the effects of his in|temperance; and in the morning, when he was told what had happened, he expre&s;&s;ed no pa&s;&s;ion but curio&s;ity: he
<PB N="69" REF="75">
went ha&s;tily into the garden; but when he had gazed upon the ruins, and en|quired how the fire began, and what it had con&s;umed, he thought of it no more.</P>
<P>But HAMET &s;uffered nothing that regarded him&s;elf, to exclude others from his attention: he went again to the ruins, not to gratify his curio&s;ity, but to &s;ee what might yet be done to alleviate the mi&s;ery of the &s;ufferers, and &s;ecure for their u&s;e what had been pre&s;erved from the flames. He found that no life had been lo&s;t, but that many per&s;ons had been hurt; to the&s;e he &s;ent the phy&s;icians of his own hou&s;hold: and having rewarded tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in their di&s;tre&s;s, not forgetting even the &s;oldiers who had only fulfilled his own orders, he
<PB N="70" REF="76">
returned, and applied him&s;elf to di&s;|patch the public bu&s;ine&s;s in the cham|ber of council, with the &s;ame patient and diligent attention as if nothing had happened. He had, indeed, ordered enquiry to be made after ALMEIDA; and when he returned to his apart|ment, he found Abdallah waiting to expre&s;s his gratitude for the obligations he had received.</P>
<P>HAMET accepted his acknowledge|ments with a peculiar plea&s;ure, for they had &s;ome connexion with AL|MEIDA; after whom he again en|quired, with an ardour uncommon even to the benevolence of HAMET. When all his que&s;tions had been a&s;ked and an&s;wered, he appeared &s;till unwil|ling to di&s;mi&s;s Abdallah, though he
<PB N="71" REF="77">
&s;eemed at a lo&s;s how to detain him; he wanted to know, whether his daugh|ter had yet received an offer of mar|riage, though he was unwilling to di&s;cover his de&s;ire by a direct enquiry: but he &s;oon found, that nothing could be known, which was not directly a&s;ked, from a man whom reverence and humility kept &s;ilent before him, except when &s;omething was &s;aid which amounted to a command to &s;peak. At length, however, he &s;aid, not without &s;ome he&s;itation, <Q>Is there no one, Abdallah, who will thank me for the pre&s;ervation of thy daughter, with a zeal equal to thy own?</Q> Yes,' replied Abdallah, <Q>that daugh|ter whom thou ha&s;t pre&s;erved.</Q> This reply, though it was unexpected, was plea&s;ing: for HAMET was not only
<PB N="72" REF="78">
gratified to hear, that ALMEIDA had expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf warmly in his behalf, at lea&s;t as a benefactor; but he judg|ed, that if any man had been intere&s;ted in her life as a lover, the an&s;wer which Abdallah had given him would not &s;o readily have occurred to his mind.</P>
<P>As this reflection kept HAMET a few moments &s;ilent, Abdallah with|drew; and HAMET, as he ob&s;erved &s;ome marks of ha&s;te and confu&s;ion in his countenance, was unwilling longer to continue him in a &s;ituation, which he had now rea&s;on to think gave him pain. But Abdallah, who had con|ceived a &s;udden thought that HAMET's que&s;tion was an indirect reproach of ALMEIDA, for not having her&s;elf &s;oli|cited admi&s;&s;ion to his pre&s;ence; went
<PB N="73" REF="79">
in ha&s;te to her apartment, and order|ed her immediately to make ready to attend him to the king.</P>
<P>ALMEIDA, upon who&s;e mind the image of HAMET had not been ab&s;ent a moment &s;ince &s;he fir&s;t &s;aw him, re|ceived this order with a mixture of pain and plea&s;ure; of wi&s;hes, hopes, and apprehen&s;ions, that filled her bo|&s;om with emotion, and covered her face with blu&s;hes. She had not courage to a&s;k the rea&s;on of the command, which &s;he in&s;tantly prepared to obey; but the tenderne&s;s of Abdallah, who perceived and pitied her di&s;tre&s;s, antici|pated her wi&s;h. In a &s;hort time, there|fore, he returned to the chamber of pre&s;ence, and having received permi&s;|&s;ion, he entered with ALMEIDA in his
<PB N="74" REF="80">
hand. HAMET ro&s;e in ha&s;te to receive her, with a glow of plea&s;ure and impati|ence in his countenance; and having rai&s;ed her from the ground, &s;upported her in his arms, waiting to hear her voice; but though &s;he made many at|tempts, &s;he could not &s;peak. HAMET, who knew not to what he owed this &s;ud|den and unexpected interview, which, though he wi&s;hed, he could contrive no means to obtain; imagined that ALMEIDA had &s;ome reque&s;t, and there|fore urged her tenderly to make it: but as &s;he &s;till remained &s;ilent, he looked at Abdallah, as expecting to hear it from him. <Q>We have no wi&s;h,</Q> &s;aid Abdallah, <Q>but to atone for our offence; nor any reque&s;t, but that my lord would now accept the thanks of ALMEIDA for the life
<PB N="75" REF="81">
which he has pre&s;erved, and impute the delay, not to ingratitude, but inadvertence: let me now take her back, as thy gift; and let the light of thy favour be upon us.</Q> <Q>Take her then,</Q> &s;aid HAMET; <Q>for I would give her only to thee.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e words of HAMET did not e&s;cape the notice either of Abdallah or ALMEIDA; but neither of them men|tioned their conjectures to the other. ALMEIDA, who was inclined to judge of HAMET's &s;ituation by her own, and who recollected many little inci|dents, known only to her&s;elf, which favoured her wi&s;hes; indulged the hope, that &s;he &s;hould again hear of HAMET, with more confidence than her father; nor were her expectations
<PB N="76" REF="82">
di&s;appointed. HAMET reflected with plea&s;ure, that he had prepared the way for a more explicit declaration; and as his impatience increa&s;ed with his pa&s;|&s;ion every hour, he &s;ent for Abdallah the next morning, and told him, that he wi&s;hed to be more acquainted with his daughter, with a view to make her his wife: <Q>As neither you nor your daughter are my &s;ubjects,</Q> &s;ays HAMET, <Q>I cannot command you; and if you were, upon this occa&s;ion I would not. I do not want a &s;lave, but a friend; not merely a woman, but a wife. If I find ALMEIDA &s;uch as my fancy has feigned her; if her mind corre&s;ponds with her form; and if I have rea&s;on to think, that &s;he can give her heart to HA|MET, and not merely her hand to the
<PB N="77" REF="83">
king; I &s;hall be happy.</Q> To this de|claration, Abdallah replied with expre&s;|&s;ions of the profounde&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and gratitude; and HAMET di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, to prepare ALMEIDA to receive him in the afternoon of the &s;ame day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>AS eight moons only had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the death of Solyman, and as the reverence of HAMET for the memory of his father would not &s;uffer him to marry till the year &s;hould be completed; he determined not to men|tion ALMEIDA to his brother, till the time when he could marry her was near. The fierce and haughty deport|ment of ALMORAN had now left HA|MET no room to doubt of his charac|ter: and though he had no apprehen|&s;ion that he would make any attempts upon ALMEIDA, after &s;he &s;hould be his wife; yet he did not know how much might ju&s;tly be feared from his pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="79" REF="85">
if he &s;hould &s;ee her and become ena|moured of her, while &s;he was yet a vir|gin in the hou&s;e of her father.</P>
<P>ALMEIDA had not only un&s;ullied pu|rity of mind, but principles of refined and exalted virtue; and as the life of HAMET was an example of all that was either great or good, Abdallah felt no anxiety upon leaving them together, except what aro&s;e from his fears, that his daughter would not be able to &s;e|cure the conque&s;t &s;he had made.</P>
<P>As it was impo&s;&s;ible for HAMET to have &s;uch an acquaintance with AL|MEIDA as he de&s;ired, till he could enter into conver&s;ation with her upon terms of equality; it was his fir&s;t care to &s;ooth her into confidence and familia|rity,
<PB N="80" REF="86">
and by degrees he &s;ucceeded: he &s;oon found, in the free intercour&s;e of mind with mind, which he e&s;tabli&s;hed in&s;tead of the implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which only ecchoed his own voice, how little of the plea&s;ure that women were formed to give can be enjoyed, when they are con&s;idered merely as &s;laves to a tyrant's will, the pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubjects of tran&s;ient dalliance and ca&s;ual enjoyment. The plea&s;ure which he took in the youthful beauty of ALMEIDA, was now endeared, exalted, and refined, by the tender &s;en|&s;ibility of her heart, and by the re|flexion of his own felicity from her eyes: when he admired the graceful|ne&s;s of her motion, the elegance of her figure, the &s;ymmetry of her features, and the bloom of her complexion, he con&s;idered them as the decorations only
<PB N="81" REF="87">
of a mind, capable of mixing with his own in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delight, of re|ciprocating all his ideas, and catching new plea&s;ure from his plea&s;ure. De&s;ire was no longer appetite; it was imagi|nation, it was rea&s;on; it included re|membrance of the pa&s;t, and anticipa|tion of the future; and its object was not the &s;ex, but ALMEIDA.</P>
<P>As HAMET never witheld any plea|&s;ure that it was in his power to impart, he &s;oon acquainted Abdallah, that he waited only for a proper time to place ALMEIDA upon the throne; but that he had &s;ome rea&s;ons for keeping a re|&s;olution, which he thought him&s;elf obliged to communicate to him, con|cealed from others.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="88">
It happened, however, that &s;ome of the women who attended upon ALMEI|DA, met with &s;ome female &s;laves be|longing to the &s;eraglio of ALMORAN, at the public baths, and related to them all the particulars of ALMEIDA's pre|&s;ervation by HAMET; that he had fir&s;t conveyed her to his own apartments, and had &s;ince been frequently with her in that which he had a&s;&s;igned her in his palace: they were al&s;o lavi&s;h in the prai&s;e of her beauty, and free in their conjectures what might be the i&s;&s;ue of her intercour&s;e with HAMET.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;ituation of HAMET and ALMEIDA became the &s;ubject of con|ver&s;ation in the &s;eraglio of ALMORAN, who learnt it him&s;elf in a &s;hort time from one of his women.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="89">
He had hitherto profe&s;&s;ed great affec|tion for HAMET, and HAMET was de|ceived by his profe&s;&s;ions: for notwith|&s;tanding the irregularities of his life, he did not think him capable of con|cealed malice; or of offering injury to another, except when he was urged by impetuous pa&s;&s;ions to immediate plea|&s;ure. As there was, therefore, an ap|pearance of mutual affection between them, ALMORAN, though the report of ALMEIDA's beauty had fired his imagination and fixed him in a re&s;oluti|on to &s;ee her, did not think proper to attempt it without a&s;king HAMET's con&s;ent, and being introduced by his order; as he made no doubt of there being a connexion between them which would make him re&s;ent a contrary con|duct.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="90">
He took an opportunity, therefore, when they were alone in a &s;ummer pavi|lion that was built on a lake behind the palace, to reproach him, with an air of mirth, for having concealed a beauty near his apartments, though he pre|tended to have no &s;eraglio. HAMET in&s;tantly di&s;covered his &s;urprize and emotion by a blu&s;h, which the next moment left his countenance paler than the light clouds that pa&s;s by night over the moon. ALMORAN took no notice of his confu&s;ion; but that he might more effectually conceal his &s;entiments and prevent &s;u&s;picion, he &s;uddenly ad|verted to another &s;ubject, while HA|MET was he&s;itating what to reply. By this artifice HAMET was deceived; and concluded, that whatever ALMORAN had heard of ALMEIDA, had pa&s;&s;ed &s;lightly
<PB N="85" REF="91">
over his mind, and was remembered but by chance; he, therefore, quickly recovered that ea&s;e and chearfulne&s;s, which always di&s;tingui&s;hed his conver|&s;ation.</P>
<P>ALMORAN ob&s;erving the &s;ucce&s;s of his artifice, &s;oon after, as if by a &s;ud|den and ca&s;ual recollection, again men|tioned the lady; and told him, he would congratulate Abdallah upon having re|&s;igned her to his bed. As HAMET could not bear to think of ALMORAN's mentioning ALMEIDA to her father as his mi&s;tre&s;s, he replied, that he had no &s;uch intimacy with ALMEIDA as he &s;uppo&s;ed; and that he had &s;o high an opinion of her virtue, as to believe, that if he &s;hould propo&s;e it &s;he would not con&s;ent. The imagination of AL|MORAN
<PB N="86" REF="92">
caught new fire from beauties which he found were yet unenjoyed, and virtue which &s;tamped them with fuperior value by rendering them more difficult of acce&s;s; and as HAMET had renounced a connection with her as a mi&s;tre&s;s, he wanted only to know whe|ther he intended her for a wife.</P>
<P>This &s;ecret he was contriving to di&s;|cover, when HAMET, having reflected, that if he concealed this particular, AL|MORAN might think him&s;elf at liberty to make what attempts he &s;hould think fit upon ALMEIDA, without being ac|countable to him, or giving him ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence, put an end to his doubts, by telling him, he had &s;uch a de&s;ign; but that it would be &s;ome time before he &s;hould carry it into execution.
<PB N="87" REF="93">
This declaration increa&s;ed ALMORAN's impatience: &s;till, however, he con|cealed his intere&s;t in the conver&s;ation, which he now &s;uffered to drop.</P>
<P>He parted from his brother, without any farther mention of ALMEIDA; but while he was yet near him, turned ha&s;|tily back, and, as if merely to gratify his curio&s;ity, told him with a &s;mile, that he mu&s;t indulge him with a &s;ight of his Circa&s;&s;ian; and de&s;ired he might accompany him in his next vi&s;it, or at &s;ome more convenient time: with this reque&s;t, HAMET, as he knew not how to refu&s;e it, complied; but it filled his mind with anxiety and trouble.</P>
<P>He went immediately to ALMEIDA, and told her all that had happened;
<PB N="88" REF="94">
and as &s;he &s;aw that he was not with|out apprehen&s;ions of mi&s;chief from his brother's vi&s;it, &s;he gently reproached him for doubting the fidelity of her affection, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed no power could be exerted by ALMORAN to in|jure him, who in power was his equal. HAMET, in a tran&s;port of tenderne&s;s, a&s;&s;ured her that he doubted neither her con&s;tancy nor her love: but as to in|terrupt the comfort of her mind, would only double his own di&s;tre&s;s, he did not tell her whence his apprehen&s;ions proceeded; nor indeed had they any determinate object, but aro&s;e in gene|ral from the character of his brother, and the probability of his becoming a competitor, for what was e&s;&s;ential to the happine&s;s of his life.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="95">
But if the happine&s;s of HAMET was le&s;&s;ened, the infelicity of ALMORAN was increa&s;ed. All the enjoyments that were in his power he neglected, his at|tention being wholly fixed upon that which was beyond his reach; he was impatient to &s;ee the beauty, who had taken intire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind; and the probability that he would be obliged to re&s;ign her to HAMET, tor|mented him with jealou&s;y, envy, and indignation.</P>
<P>HAMET, however, did not long de|lay to fulfil his promi&s;e to his brother; but having prepared ALMEIDA to re|ceive him, he conducted him to her apartment. The idea which ALMORAN had formed in his imagination, was ex|ceeded by the reality, and his pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="90" REF="96">
was proportionably increa&s;ed; yet he found means not only to conceal it from HAMET, but from ALMEIDA, by affecting an air of levity and merriment, which is not le&s;s incompatible with the plea&s;ures than the pains of love. Af|ter they had been regaled with coffee and &s;herbet, they parted; and HAMET congratulated him&s;elf, that his appre|hen&s;ions of finding in ALMORAN a ri|val for ALMEIDA's love, were now at an end.</P>
<P>But ALMORAN, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were become more violent by re&s;traint, was in a &s;tate of mind little better than di&s;|traction: one moment he determined to &s;eize upon the per&s;on of ALMEIDA in the night, and &s;ecrete her in &s;ome place acce&s;&s;ible only to him&s;elf; and
<PB N="91" REF="97">
the next to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his brother, that he might at once de&s;troy a rival both in empire and in love. But the&s;e de|&s;igns were no &s;ooner formed by his wi&s;hes, than they were rejected by his fears: he was not ignorant, that in any conte&s;t between him and HAMET, the voice of the public would be again&s;t him; e&s;pecially in a conte&s;t, in which it would appear, that HAMET had &s;uf|fered wrong.</P>
<P>Many other projects, equally ra&s;h, violent, and injurious, were by turns conceived and rejected: and he came at la&s;t to no other determination, than &s;till carefully to conceal his pa&s;&s;ion, till he &s;hould think of &s;ome expedient to gratify it; le&s;t HAMET &s;hould have a
<PB N="92" REF="98">
ju&s;t rea&s;on for refu&s;ing to let him &s;ee the lady again, and remove her to &s;ome place which he might never be able to di&s;cover.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time, OMAR, to whom HAMET had from time to time di&s;|clo&s;ed the minute&s;t particulars of his &s;ituation and de&s;ign, kept his eye al|mo&s;t continually upon ALMORAN; and ob&s;erved him with an attention and &s;agacity, which it was difficult either to elude or deceive. He perceived, that he was more than u&s;ual re&s;tle&s;s and turbulent; that in the pre&s;ence of HAMET he frequently changed coun|tenance; that his behaviour was artifi|cial and incon&s;i&s;tent, frequently &s;hifting from gloomy di&s;content and furious agitation, to forced laughter and noi&s;y
<PB N="94" REF="100">
merriment. He had al&s;o remarked, that he &s;eemed mo&s;t di&s;compo&s;ed after he had been with HAMET to ALMEI|DA, which happened generally once in a week; that he was become fond of &s;olitude, and was ab&s;ent &s;everal days together from the apartment of his women.</P>
<P>OMAR, who from this conduct of ALMORAN had begun to &s;u&s;pect his principles, determined to introduce &s;uch topics of di&s;cour&s;e, as might lead him to di&s;cover the &s;tate of his mind; and enable him to enforce and confirm the principles he had taught him, by new proofs and illu&s;trations.</P>
<P>ALMORAN, who, &s;ince the death of his father, had nothing to appre|hend
<PB N="95" REF="101">
from the di&s;covery of &s;entiments which before he had been careful to conceal; now urged his objections again&s;t religion, when OMAR gave him opportunity, without re&s;erve. <Q>You tell me,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>of beings that are immortal, becau&s;e they are im|material; beings which do not con|&s;i&s;t of parts, and which, therefore, can admit no &s;olution, the only na|tural cau&s;e of corruption and decay: but that which is not material, can have no exten&s;ion; and what has no exten&s;ion, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no &s;pace; and of &s;uch beings, the mind it&s;elf, which you pretend to be &s;uch a being, has no conception.</Q></P>
<P>'If the mind,' &s;ays OMAR, <Q>can perceive that there is in it&s;elf any

&s;ingle property of &s;uch a being, it has irrefragable evidence that it is &s;uch a being; though its mode of exi&s;tence, as di&s;tinct from matter, cannot now be comprehended.</Q> <Q>And what property of &s;uch a being,</Q> &s;aid ALMORAN, <Q>does the mind of man perceive in it&s;elf?</Q> 'That of <HI>acting,'</HI> &s;aid OMAR, <Q>without <HI>motion.</HI> You have no idea, that a material &s;ub&s;tance can act, but in proportion as it moves: yet to <HI>think,</HI> is to <HI>act;</HI> and with the idea of thinking, the idea of motion is never connected: on the contrary, we always conceive the mind to be fixed, in proportion to the degree of ardour and inten&s;ene&s;s with which the power of thinking is exerted. Now, if that which is material cannot act without motion; and if man is
<PB N="98" REF="103">
con&s;cious, that to think, is to act and not to move; it follows, that there is, in man, &s;omewhat that is not matter; &s;omewhat that has no exten|&s;ion, and that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no &s;pace; &s;omewhat which, having no contex|ture or parts that can be di&s;&s;olved or &s;eparated, is exempted from all the natural cau&s;es of decay.</Q></P>
<P>OMAR pau&s;ed; and ALMORAN hav|ing &s;tood &s;ome moments without reply, he &s;eized this opportunity to impre&s;s him with an awful &s;en&s;e of the power and pre&s;ence of the Supreme and Eter|nal Being, from whom his own exi&s;t|ence was derived: <Q>Let us remem|ber,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>that to every act of this immaterial and immortal part, the Father of &s;pirits, from whom it

proceeds, is pre&s;ent: when I behold the bu&s;y multitudes that crowd the metropolis of Per&s;ia, in the per&s;uit of bu&s;ine&s;s and projects infinitely complicated and various; and con|&s;ider that every idea which pa&s;&s;es over their minds, every conclu&s;ion, and every purpo&s;e, with all that they remember of the pa&s;t, and all that they imagine of the future, is at once known to the Almighty, who without labour or confu&s;ion weighs every thought of every mind in His balance, and re&s;erves it to the day of retribution; my follies cover me with confu&s;ion, and my &s;oul is hum|bled in the du&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>ALMORAN, though he appeared to li&s;ten with attention, and offered no|thing
<PB N="99" REF="105">
again&s;t the rea&s;oning of OMAR, yet &s;ecretly de&s;pi&s;ed it as &s;ophi&s;try, which cunning only had rendered &s;pe|cious; and which he was unable to confute, merely becau&s;e it was &s;ubtil, and not becau&s;e it was true: he had been led, by his pa&s;&s;ions, fir&s;t to love, and then to adopt different opinions; and as every man is inclined to judge of others by him&s;elf, he doubted, whe|ther the principles which OMAR had thus laboured to e&s;tabli&s;h, were be|lieved even by OMAR him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus was the mind of ALMORAN to the in&s;tructions of OMAR, as a rock &s;lightly covered with earth, is to the waters of heaven: the craggs are left bare by the rain that wa&s;hes them; and the &s;ame &s;howers that fertilize the field,
<PB N="100" REF="106">
can only di&s;cover the &s;terility of the rock.</P>
<P>OMAR, however, did not yet di&s;|clo&s;e his &s;u&s;picions to HAMET, be|cau&s;e he did not yet &s;ee that it could an&s;wer any purpo&s;e. To remove AL|MEIDA from her apartment, would be to &s;hew a di&s;tru&s;t, for which there would not appear to be any cau&s;e; and to refu&s;e ALMORAN acce&s;s to her when he de&s;ired it, might precipitate &s;uch mea&s;ures as he might meditate, and engage him in &s;ome de&s;perate at|tempt: he, therefore, contented him|&s;elf with advi&s;ing HAMET, to conceal the time of his marriage till the even|ing before he intended it &s;hould take place, without a&s;&s;igning the rea&s;on on which his advice was founded.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="107">
To the council of OMAR, HAMET was implicitly obedient, as to the re|velations of the Prophet; but, like his in&s;tructions, it was neglected by AL|MORAN, who became every moment more wretched. He had a graceful per&s;on, and a vigorous mind; he was in the bloom of youth, and had a con|&s;titution that promi&s;ed him length of days; he had power which princes were emulous to obey, and wealth by which whatever could admini&s;ter to luxury might be bought; for every pa&s;&s;ion, and every appetite, it was ea&s;y for him to procure a perpetual &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of new objects: yet was AL|MORAN, not only without enjoyment, but without peace; he was by turns pining with di&s;content, and raving with indignation; his vices had ex|tracted
<PB N="102" REF="108">
bitter from every &s;weet; and having exhau&s;ted nature for delight in vain, he was repining at the bounds in which he was confined, and re|gretting the want of other powers as the cau&s;e of his mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Thus the year of mourning for So|lyman was compleated, without any act of violence on the part of ALMO|RAN, or of caution on the part of HAMET: but on the evening of the la&s;t day, HAMET, having &s;ecretly pre|pared every thing for performing the &s;olemnity in a private manner, ac|quainted ALMORAN by a letter, which OMAR undertook to deliver, that he &s;hould celebrate his marriage on the morrow. ALMORAN, who never doubt|ed but he &s;hould have notice of this
<PB N="103" REF="109">
event much longer before it was to happen, read the letter with a pertur|bation that it was impo&s;&s;ible to con|ceal: he was alone in his private apart|ment, and taking his eye ha&s;tily from the paper, he cru&s;hed it together in his hand, and thru&s;ting it into his bo&s;om, turned from OMAR without &s;peaking; and OMAR, thinking him|&s;elf di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, withdrew.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions which ALMORAN could no longer &s;uppre&s;s, now bur&s;t out in a torrent of exclamation: 'Am I then, &s;aid he, <Q>bla&s;ted for ever with a dou|ble cur&s;e, divided empire and di&s;ap|pointed love! What is dominion, if it is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed alone? and what is power, which the dread of rival power perpetually controuls? Is it for
<PB N="104" REF="110">
me to li&s;ten in &s;ilence to the wrang|ling of &s;laves, that I may at la&s;t ap|portion to them what, with a clamo|rous in&s;olence, they demand as their due! as well may the &s;un linger in his cour&s;e, and the world mourn in darkne&s;s for the day, that the glow|worm may &s;till be &s;een to glimmer upon the earth, and the owls and bats that haunt the &s;epulchres of the dead enjoy a longer night. Yet this have I done, becau&s;e this has been done by HAMET: and my heart &s;ickens in vain with the de&s;ire of beauty, becau&s;e my power extends not to ALMEIDA. With dominion undivided and ALMEIDA, I &s;hould be ALMORAN; but without them, I am le&s;s than nothing.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="111">
OMAR, who, before he had pa&s;&s;ed the pavilion, heard a &s;ound which he knew to be the voice of ALMORAN, re|turned ha&s;tily to the chamber in which he left him, believing he had with|drawn too &s;oon, and that the king, as he knew no other was pre&s;ent, was &s;peaking to him: he &s;oon drew near enough to hear what was &s;aid; and while he was &s;tanding torpid in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, dreading to be di&s;covered, and not knowing how to retire, ALMORAN turned about.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, both &s;tood motionle&s;s with confu&s;ion and amazement; but AL|MORAN's pride &s;oon &s;urmounted his other pa&s;&s;ions, and his di&s;dain of OMAR gave his guilt the firmne&s;s of virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="112">
'It is true,' &s;aid he, <Q>that thou ha&s;t &s;tolen the &s;ecret of my heart; but do not think, that I fear it &s;hould be known: though my poig|nard could take it back with thy life, I leave it with thee. To reproach, or cur&s;e thee, would do thee ho|nour, and lift thee into an import|ance which otherwi&s;e thou can&s;t never reach.</Q> ALMORAN then turned from him with a contemptuous frown: but OMAR caught him by the robe; and pro&s;trating him&s;elf upon the ground, intreated to be heard. His importu|nity at length prevailed; and he at|tempted to exculpate him&s;elf, from the charge of having in&s;iduou&s;ly intruded upon the privacy of his prince; but ALMORAN &s;ternly interrupted him: 'And what art thou,' &s;aid he, <Q>that I
<PB N="107" REF="113">
&s;hould care, whether thou art inno|cent or guilty?</Q> <Q>If not for my &s;ake,</Q> &s;aid OMAR, <Q>li&s;ten for thy own; and though my duty is de|&s;pi&s;ed, let my affection be heard. That thou art not happy, I know; and I now know the cau&s;e. Let my lord pardon the pre&s;umption of his &s;lave: he that &s;eeks to &s;atisfy all his wi&s;hes, mu&s;t be wretched; he only can be happy, by whom &s;ome are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</Q> At the&s;e words ALMO|RAN &s;natched his robe from the hand of OMAR, and &s;purned him in a tran&s;|port of rage and indignation: <Q>The &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of de&s;ire,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>is &s;uch happine&s;s, as that of the deaf who do not remember to have heard. If it is virtue, know, that, as virtue, I de&s;pi&s;e it; for though it may &s;e|cure
<PB N="108" REF="114">
the obedience of the &s;lave, it can only degrade the prerogative of a prince. I ca&s;t off all re&s;traint, as I do thee: begone, therefore, to HAMET, and &s;ee me no more.</Q></P>
<P>OMAR obeyed without reply; and ALMORAN being again alone, the con|flict in his mind was renewed with greater violence than before. He felt all that he had di&s;gui&s;ed to OMAR, with the keene&s;t &s;en&s;ibility; and anti|cipated the effects of his detection, with unutterable angui&s;h and regret. He walked backward and forward with a ha&s;ty but interrupted pace; &s;ome|times &s;topping &s;hort, and pre&s;&s;ing his hand hard upon his brow; and &s;ome|times by violent ge&s;tures &s;howing the agitation of his mind: he &s;ometimes
<PB N="109" REF="115">
&s;tood &s;ilent with his eyes fixed upon the ground, and his arms folded toge|ther; and &s;ometimes a &s;udden agony of thought forced him into loud and tumultuous exclamations: he cur&s;ed the impotence of mind that had &s;uf|fered his thoughts to e&s;cape from him unawares, without reflecting that he was even then repeating the folly; and while he felt him&s;elf the victim of vice, he could not &s;uppre&s;s his contempt of virtue: 'If I mu&s;t peri&s;h,' &s;aid he, <Q>I will at lea&s;t peri&s;h un&s;ubdued: I will quench no wi&s;h that nature kin|dles in my bo&s;om; nor &s;hall my lips utter any prayer, but for new powers to feed the flame.</Q></P>
<P>As he uttered this expre&s;&s;ion, he felt the palace &s;hake; he heard a ru&s;h|ing,
<PB N="110" REF="116">
like a bla&s;t in the de&s;art; and a being of more than human appearance &s;tood before him. ALMORAN, though he was terrified, was not humbled; and he &s;tood expecting the event, whether evil or good, rather with obduracy than courage.</P>
<P>'Thou &s;ee&s;t,' &s;ays the Appearance, <Q>a Genius, whom the daring purpo&s;e of thy mind has convoked from the middle region, where he was ap|pointed to wait the &s;ignal; and who is now permitted to act in concert with thy will.

<P>ALMORAN, when he recovered from his a&s;toni&s;hment, and had reflected upon the prodigy, determined to wait the i&s;&s;ue, and refer all his hopes to the interpo&s;ition of the Ge|nius, without attempting any thing to retard the marriage; at which he re|&s;olved to be pre&s;ent, that he might im|prove any &s;upernatural event which might be produced in his favour.</P>
<P>HAMET, in the mean time, was an|ticipating the morrow with a mixture of anxiety and plea&s;ure; and though he had no rea&s;on to think any thing
<PB N="114" REF="120">
could prevent his marriage, yet he wi&s;hed it was over, with an impatience that was con&s;iderably increa&s;ed by fear.</P>
<P>Though the anticipation of the great event that was now &s;o near, kept him waking the greate&s;t part of the night, yet he ro&s;e early in the morning; and while he waited till ALMEIDA &s;hould be ready to &s;ee him, he was told that OMAR was without, and de&s;ired admittance. When he came in, HAMET, who al|ways watched his countenance as a mariner the &s;tars of heaven, perceived that it was ob&s;cured with perplexity and grief. 'Tell me,' &s;aid HAMET, <Q>whence is the &s;orrow that I di&s;cover in thy face?</Q> 'I am &s;orrowful,' &s;aid OMAR, 'not for my&s;elf, but for thee.' At the&s;e words HAMET &s;tept back|ward,
<PB N="115" REF="121">
and fixed his eyes upon OMAR, without power to &s;peak. 'Con&s;ider, &s;aid OMAR, <Q>that thou art not a man only, but a prince: con&s;ider al&s;o, that immortality is before thee; and that thy felicity, during the endle&s;s ages of immortality, depends upon thy|&s;elf: fear not, therefore, what thou can&s;t &s;uffer from others; the evil and the good of life are tran&s;ient as the morning dew, and over the&s;e only the hand of others can prevail.</Q></P>
<P>HAMET, who&s;e attachment to life was &s;trong, and who&s;e expectations of immediate enjoyment were high, did not feel the force of what OMAR had &s;aid, though he a&s;&s;ented to its truth. 'Tell me,' &s;aid he, <Q>at once, what thou feare&s;t for me; deliver me from
<PB N="116" REF="122">
the torments of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and tru&s;t my own fortitude to &s;ave me from de&s;pair.</Q> 'Know then,' &s;aid OMAR, <Q>that thou art hated by ALMORAN, and that he loves ALMEIDA.</Q> At this declaration, the a&s;toni&s;hment of HAMET was equal to his concern; and he was in doubt whether to believe or di&s;believe what he heard: but the moment he recollected the wi&s;dom and integrity of OMAR, his doubts were at an end; and having recovered from his &s;urprize, he was about to make &s;uch enquiries as might gratify the anxious and tumultuous curio&s;ity which was excited in his brea&s;t, when OMAR, lifting up his hand, and beginning again to &s;peak, HAMET remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="123">
'Thou knowe&s;t,' &s;aid OMAR, <Q>that when my cheeks were yet ruddy with youth, and my limbs were braced by vigour, that mine eye was guided to knowledge by the lamp that is kind|led at midnight; and much of what is hidden in the innermo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of nature, was di&s;covered to me: my prayer a&s;cended in &s;ecret to Him, with whom there is wi&s;dom from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting, and He il|luminated my darkne&s;s with His light. I know, by &s;uch &s;en&s;ations as the world either feels not at all, or feels unnoticed without knowledge of their u&s;e, when the powers that are invi&s;ible are permitted to mingle in the walks of men; and well I know, that &s;ome being, who is more than mortal, has joined with ALMORAN
<PB N="118" REF="124">
again&s;t thee, &s;ince the veil of night was la&s;t &s;pread upon the earth.</Q></P>
<P>HAMET, who&s;e blood was chilled with horror, and who&s;e nerves were no longer obedient to his will, after &s;everal ineffectual attempts to &s;peak, looked up at OMAR; and &s;triking his hand upon his brea&s;t, cried out, in an ear|ne&s;t, but faultering voice, <Q>What &s;hall I do?</Q> 'Thou mu&s;t do,' &s;aid OMAR, <Q>that which is RIGHT. Let not thy foot be drawn by any al|lurement, or driven by any terror, from the path of virtue. While thou art there, thou art in &s;afety: and though the world &s;hould unite again&s;t thee, by the united world thou can&s;t not be hurt.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="125">
'But what friendly power,' &s;aid HAMET, <Q>&s;hall guard even the path of virtue from grief and pain; from the &s;ilent &s;haft of di&s;appointed love, or the &s;ounding &s;courge of outrage|ous jealou&s;y? The&s;e, &s;urely, have overtaken the foot of per&s;everance; and by the&s;e, though I &s;hould per|&s;evere, may my feet be overtaken.</Q> What thou &s;aye&s;t,' replied OMAR, <Q>is true; and it is true al&s;o, that the tempe&s;t which roots up the fore&s;t, is driven over the mountain with un|abated rage: but from the moun|tain, what can it take more than the vegetable du&s;t, which the hand of nature has &s;cattered upon the mo&s;s that covers it? As the du&s;t is to the mountain, &s;o is all that the &s;torms of life can take from virtue, to the
<PB N="120" REF="126">
&s;um of good which the Omnipotent has appointed for its reward.</Q> HA|MET, who&s;e eye now expre&s;&s;ed a kind of doubtful confidence, a hope that was repre&s;&s;ed by fear, remained &s;till &s;ilent; and OMAR, perceiving the &s;tate of his mind, proceeded to fortify it by new precepts: 'If heaven,' &s;aid he, <Q>&s;hould vani&s;h like a vapour, and this firm orb of earth &s;hould crumble into du&s;t, the virtuous mind would &s;tand unmoved amid&s;t the ruins of nature: for He, who has appointed the heavens and the earth to fail, has &s;aid to virtue, <Q>Fear not; for thou can&s;t neither peri&s;h, nor be wretched.</Q> Call up thy &s;trength, therefore, to the fight in which thou art &s;ure of conque&s;t: do thou only
<PB N="121" REF="127">
that which is RIGHT, and leave the event to Heaven.</Q></P>
<P>HAMET, in this conference with OMAR, having gradually recovered his fortitude; and the time being now near, when he was to conduct AL|MEIDA to the court of the palace, where the marriage ceremony was to be performed; they parted with mu|tual benedictions, each recommending the other to the protection of the Mo&s;t High.</P>
<P>At the appointed hour, the princes of the court being a&s;&s;embled, the mufti and the imans being ready, and ALMORAN &s;eated upon his throne; HAMET and ALMEIDA came forward, and were placed one on the right hand,
<PB N="122" REF="128">
and the other on the left. The mufti was then advancing, to hear and to re|cord the mutual promi&s;e which was to unite them; ALMORAN was execrating the appearance of the Genius, as a de|lu&s;ive dream, in all the tumults of an|gui&s;h and de&s;pair; and HAMET began to hope, that the &s;u&s;picions of OMAR had been ill founded; when a &s;troke of thunder &s;hook the palace to its foun|dations, and a cloud ro&s;e from the ground, like a thick &s;moke, between HAMET and ALMEIDA.</P>
<P>ALMORAN, who was in&s;pired with new confidence and hope, by that which had &s;truck the re&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly with terror, &s;tarted from his &s;eat with an ardent and furious look; and at the &s;ame moment, a voice, that i&s;&s;ued from
<PB N="123" REF="129">
the cloud, pronounced with a loud but hollow tone,
<Q>Fate has decreed, to ALMORAN, ALMEIDA.</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e words, ALMORAN ru&s;hed forward, and placing him&s;elf by the &s;ide of ALMEIDA, the cloud di&s;ap|peared; and he cried out, <Q>Let me now proclaim to the world the &s;ecret, which to this moment I have hidden in my bo&s;om: I love ALMEIDA. The being who alone knew my love, has now by miracle approved it. Let his decree be accompli&s;hed.</Q> He then commanded that the ceremony &s;hould proceed; and &s;eizing the hand of the lady, began to repeat that part of it which was to have been repeated by HAMET. But ALMEIDA in&s;tantly drew her hand from him in an agony of di&s;|tre&s;s;
<PB N="124" REF="130">
and HAMET, who till then had &s;tood motionle&s;s with amazement and horror, &s;tarted from his trance, and &s;pringing forward ru&s;hed between them. ALMORAN turned fiercely upon him; but HAMET, who having been warned by OMAR, knew the prodigy to be effected by &s;ome evil being whom it was virtue to re&s;i&s;t, laid his hand upon his &s;cymi|tar, and, with a frown of indignation and defiance, commanded him to &s;tand off: 'I now know thee,' &s;aid he, <Q>as a man; and, therefore, as a brother I know thee not.</Q></P>
<P>ALMORAN reflecting, that the foun|dation of this reproach was unknown to all who were pre&s;ent, and that to them he would therefore appear to be injured; looked round with an affected
<PB N="125" REF="131">
&s;mile of wonder and compa&s;&s;ion, as ap|pealing to them from a charge that was thus fiercely and injuriou&s;ly brought again&s;t him, and imputing it to the violence of &s;udden pa&s;&s;ions by which truth and rea&s;on were overborne. The eye of HAMET at once detected the artifice, which he di&s;dained to expo&s;e; he, therefore, commanded the guard that attended to carry off ALMEIDA to her apartment. The guard was prepar|ing to obey, when ALMORAN, who thought he had now &s;uch an opportu|nity to get her into his own power as would never return, ordered them to &s;ee her &s;afely lodged in his own &s;eraglio.</P>
<P>The men, who thus received oppo|&s;ite commands from per&s;ons to whom
<PB N="126" REF="132">
they owed equal obedience, &s;tood &s;till in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, not knowing which to prefer: ALMORAN then reproached them with want of obedience, not to him, but to God, appealing to the pro|digy for the ju&s;tification of his claim. HAMET, on the contrary, repeated his order, with a look and empha&s;is &s;carce le&s;s commanding than the thunder and the voice. But the prie&s;ts interpo&s;ing in favour of ALMORAN, upon pre&s;ump|tion that his right had been decided by a &s;uperior power; the guard ru&s;h|ed between HAMET and ALMEIDA, and with looks that expre&s;&s;ed the ut|mo&s;t reluctance and regret, attempted to &s;eparate their hands, which were cla&s;ped in each other. She was af|frighted at the violence, but yet more at the apprehen&s;ion of what was to
<PB N="127" REF="133">
follow; &s;he, therefore, turned her eyes upon HAMET, conjuring him not to leave her, in a tone of tenderne&s;s and di&s;|tre&s;s which it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe: he replied with a vehemence that was worthy of his pa&s;&s;ion, <Q>I will not leave thee, and immediately drew his &s;a|bre.</Q> At the &s;ame moment they forced her from him; and a party having in|terpo&s;ed to cover tho&s;e that were car|rying her off, HAMET lifted up his weapon to force his pa&s;&s;age through them; but was prevented by OMAR, who, having pre&s;&s;ed through the crowd, pre&s;ented him&s;elf before him. <Q>Stop me not,</Q> &s;aid HAMET, <Q>it is for ALMEIDA.</Q> 'If thou would&s;t &s;ave ALMEIDA,' &s;aid OMAR, <Q>and thy&s;elf, do that only which is RIGHT. What have the&s;e done who oppo&s;e thee,
<PB N="128" REF="134">
more than they ought? and what end can their de&s;truction an&s;wer, but to &s;tain thy hands with unavailing murder? Thou can&s;t only take the life of a few faithful &s;laves, who will not lift up their hands again&s;t thee: thou can&s;t not re&s;cue ALMEIDA from thy brother; but thou can&s;t pre&s;erve thy&s;elf from guilt.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e words of OMAR &s;u&s;pended the rage of HAMET, like a charm; and returning his &s;cymitar into its &s;heath, 'Let me then,' &s;aid he, <Q>&s;uf|fer, and be guiltle&s;s. It is true, that again&s;t the&s;e ranks my &s;ingle arm mu&s;t be ineffectual; but if my wrongs can rou&s;e a nation to repre&s;s the tyranny, that will &s;hortly extend over it the injuries that now reach
<PB N="129" REF="135">
only to me, ju&s;tice &s;hall be done to HAMET.</Q> Then turning to ALMO|RAN, 'Henceforth,' &s;aid he, <Q>the king|dom &s;hall be mine or thine. To go|vern in concert with thee, is to a&s;&s;o|ciate with the powers of hell. The beings that are &s;uperior to evil, are the friends of HAMET; and if the&s;e are thy enemies, what &s;hall be thy defence?</Q> ALMORAN replied only by a contemptuous &s;mile; and the a&s;|&s;embly being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed he retired to his apartment: and HAMET and OMAR went out to the people, who had ga|thered in an incredible multitude about the palace.</P>

<P>A Rumour of what had happened within had reached them, which &s;ome believed, and &s;ome doubted: but when they &s;aw OMAR and HAMET re|turn together, and ob&s;erved that their looks were full of re&s;entment and trou|ble, they became &s;ilent with attention in a moment; which OMAR ob&s;erving, addre&s;&s;ed them with an eloquence of which they had often acknowledged the force, and of which they never re|pented the effect.</P>
<P>He told them the tender connexion between HAMET and ALMEIDA, and
<PB N="131" REF="137">
di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ubtil hypocri&s;y of ALMO|RAN: he expatiated upon the folly of &s;uppo&s;ing, that the power that was &s;u|preme in goodne&s;s and truth, &s;hould command a violation of vows that had been mutually interchanged, and often repeated; and devote to ALMORAN the beauties, which could only be vo|luntarily &s;urrendered to HAMET. They heard him with a vacant countenance of &s;urprize and wonder; and while he waited for their reply, they agreed among them&s;elves, that no man could avoid the de&s;tiny that was written upon his head; and that if ALMEIDA had thus been taken from HAMET, and given to ALMORAN, it was an event that by an unchangeable decree was appointed to happen; and that, there|fore, it was their duty to acquie&s;ce.
<PB N="132" REF="138">
OMAR then beckoned with his hand for audience a &s;econd time; and told them, that ALMORAN had not only practi&s;ed the arts of &s;orcery to deprive HAMET of ALMEIDA, but that he me|ditated a de&s;ign to u&s;urp the &s;ole do|minion, and deprive him of the &s;hare of the government to which he had a right by the will of Solyman his fa|ther. This al&s;o they heard with the &s;ame &s;entiments of wonder and ac|quie&s;cence: If it is decreed, &s;aid they, that ALMORAN &s;hall be king alone, who can prevent it? and if it is not, who can bring it to pa&s;s? <Q>But know ye not,</Q> &s;aid OMAR, <Q>that when the end is appointed, the means are ap|pointed al&s;o. If it is decreed that one of you &s;hall this night die by
<PB N="133" REF="139">
poi&s;on, is it not decreed al&s;o that he &s;hall drink it?</Q></P>
<P>The crowd now gazed upon each other, without reply, for &s;ome minutes: and at la&s;t they only &s;aid, that no ef|fort of theirs could change the univer|&s;al appointment of all things; that if ALMORAN was to be king alone, he would be fo notwith&s;tanding all oppo&s;i|tion; and that if he was not to be king alone, no attempt of his own, however &s;upported, could make him &s;o. 'I will not,' &s;aid OMAR, <Q>con|tradict your opinion; I will only tell you what I have heard, and leave you to &s;uffer the calamities which threaten you, with a fortitude and re&s;ignation that are &s;uitable to your principles; having no con&s;olation to
<PB N="134" REF="140">
offer you, but that HAMET, who&s;e de&s;tiny it was not to make you happy, will &s;uffer with you the evils, that neither he nor you could pre|vent: the mournful comfort of this fellow&s;hip, he will not be denied; for he loves you too well, to wi&s;h even to be happy alone.</Q> The crowd fixed their eyes upon HAMET, for whom their affection was now &s;trongly moved, with looks of much greater intelligence and &s;en&s;ibility; a confu&s;ed murmur, like the fall of the pebbles upon the beach when the &s;urge retires from the &s;hore, expre&s;&s;ed their gratitude to HAMET, and their apprehen&s;ions for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>OMAR waited till they were again &s;ilent, and then improved the advan|tage he had gained. 'ALMORAN,'
<PB N="135" REF="141">
&s;aid he, <Q>con&s;iders you as the &s;laves of his power; HAMET as the objects of his benevolence: your lives and your properties, in the opinion of ALMO|RAN, are below his notice; but HA|MET con&s;iders his own intere&s;t as connected with yours. When ALMO|RAN, therefore, &s;hall be unchecked by the influence of HAMET; he will leave you to the mercy of &s;ome dele|gated tyrant, who&s;e whole power will be exerted to oppre&s;s you, that he may enrich him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>A new fire was now kindled in their eyes, and their cheeks glowed with indignation at the wrongs that threat|ened them; they were no longer di&s;|po&s;ed to act upon the principles of fa|tality, as they had perver&s;ely under|&s;tood
<PB N="136" REF="142">
them; and they argued at once like rea&s;onable and free beings, who&s;e actions were in their choice, and who had no doubt but that their actions would produce adequate effects. They recollected that OMAR had, in the reign of Solyman, often re&s;cued them from &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion, as now threat|ened them; and that the power of HAMET had &s;ince interpo&s;ed in their behalf, when ALMORAN would have &s;tretched his prerogative to their hurt, or have left them a prey to the farmer of a tax. 'Shall HAMET,' &s;aid they, <Q>be deprived of the power, that he employs only for our benefit; and &s;hall it center in ALMORAN, who will abu&s;e it to our ruin? Shall we ra|ther &s;upport ALMORAN in the wrong he has done to HAMET, than HA|MET
<PB N="137" REF="143">
to obtain ju&s;tice of ALMORAN? HAMET is our king; let him com|mand us, and we will obey.</Q> This was uttered with a &s;hout that ecchoed from the mountains beyond the city, and continued near a full hour. In the mean time, the multitude was in|crea&s;ing every moment; and the troops that lay in and near the city having taken arms, fell in with the &s;tream: they were &s;ecretly attached to HA|MET, under who&s;e eye they had been formed, and of who&s;e bounty they had often partaken; and their fear being removed by the general cry, which left them no room to apprehend an oppo|&s;ition in favour of ALMORAN, they were now at full liberty to follow their inclinations.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="144">
In the mean time, ALMORAN, who had retired to the innermo&s;t court of the palace, had heard the tumult, and was alarmed for his &s;afety: he ran from room to room, confu&s;ed and ter|rified, without attempting or directing any thing either for his defence or e&s;cape; yet he &s;ent every moment to know the &s;tate of the in&s;urrection, and to what end its force would be di|rected.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e whom accident rather than choice had attached to the intere&s;t of ALMORAN, were O&s;myn and Caled: they were both di&s;tingui&s;hed by his fa|vour; and each had conceived hopes that, if he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the throne alone, he would delegate his authority to him. ALMORAN now ordered them
<PB N="139" REF="145">
to take the command of the troops, that were appointed to attend his per|&s;on as their peculiar duty, with as many others as had not declared for HAMET, and to &s;ecure all the avenues that led to his &s;eraglio.</P>
<P>OMAR and HAMET were now on hor&s;eback, and had begun to form the troops that had joined them, and as many others as were armed, which were before mingled together in a con|fu&s;ed multitude. An account of this was brought to ALMORAN by O&s;myn; and threw him into a perturbation and perplexity, that di&s;graced his charac|ter, and confounded his attendants. He urged O&s;myn, in whom he mo&s;t confided, to di&s;patch, without giving him any orders to execute; then turn|ing
<PB N="140" REF="146">
from him, he uttered, in a low and inarticulate voice, the mo&s;t pa&s;|&s;ionate exclamations of di&s;tre&s;s and terror, being &s;truck with the thought that his guard might betray him: when he recollected him&s;elf, and perceived that O&s;myn was &s;till pre&s;ent, he bur&s;t into a rage, and &s;natching out his poig|nard, he &s;wore by the &s;oul of the Pro|phet, that if he did not in&s;tantly at|tempt &s;omething, he would &s;tab him to the heart. O&s;myn drew back trem|bling and confu&s;ed; but having yet received no orders, he would have &s;poken, but ALMORAN drove him from his pre&s;ence with menaces and execrations.</P>
<P>The moment that O&s;myn left him, his rage &s;ub&s;ided in his fears, and his
<PB N="141" REF="147">
fears were mingled with remor&s;e: 'Which way &s;oever I turn,' &s;aid he, <Q>I &s;ee my&s;elf &s;urrounded by de&s;truc|tion. I have incen&s;ed O&s;myn by un|rea&s;onable di&s;plea&s;ure, and cau&s;ele&s;s menaces. He mu&s;t regard me at once with abhorrence and contempt: and it is impo&s;&s;ible, but he &s;hould revolt to HAMET.</Q></P>
<P>In this agony, the terrors of futu|rity ru&s;hed upon his mind with all their force; and he &s;tarted as if at the bite of a &s;corpion: 'To me,' &s;aid he, <Q>death, that now approaches, will be but the beginning of &s;orrow. I &s;hall be cut off at once from enjoyment, and from hope; and the dreadful moment is now at hand.</Q> While he was &s;peaking, the palace again &s;hook,
<PB N="142" REF="148">
and he &s;tood again in the pre&s;ence of the Genius.</P>
<P>'ALMORAN,' &s;aid the inhabitant of the unapparent world, <Q>the evil which thou feare&s;t, &s;hall not be upon thee. Make ha&s;te, and &s;hew thy&s;elf from the gallery to the people, and the tumult of faction &s;hall be &s;till before thee: tell them, that their rebellion is not again&s;t thee only, but again&s;t Him by whom thou reigne&s;t: ap|peal boldly to that power for a con|firmation of thy words, and rely for the atte&s;ting &s;ign upon me.</Q> ALMO|RAN, who had &s;tooped with his face to the ground, now looked upward, and found him&s;elf alone: he ha&s;ted, therefore, to follow the directions he
<PB N="143" REF="149">
had received; and hope was again kindled in his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>O&s;myn, in the mean time, made a proper di&s;po&s;ition of the troops now under his command; and had directed a &s;elect company to remain near the per&s;on of the king, that they might at lea&s;t make good his retreat. While he was waiting at his po&s;t, and revolving in his mind the total di&s;appointment of his hopes, and con&s;idering what he &s;hould do if HAMET &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf alone, he was joined by Caled.</P>
<P>Caled had a &s;ecret enmity again&s;t O&s;myn, as his rival in the favour of ALMORAN; but as he had concealed his own preten&s;ions from O&s;myn, O&s;|myn had no ill will again&s;t Caled. As
<PB N="144" REF="150">
they were now likely to be involved in one common calamity, by the ruin of the prince who&s;e party they had e&s;|pou&s;ed; Caled's enmity &s;ub&s;ided, and the indifference of O&s;myn was warmed into kindne&s;s: mutual di&s;tre&s;s pro|duced mutual confidence; and Caled, after condoling with O&s;myn on their pre&s;ent hopele&s;s &s;ituation, propo&s;ed that they &s;hould draw off their forces, and revolt to HAMET. This propo&s;i|tion O&s;myn rejected, not only from principle, but from intere&s;t: <Q>Now we have accepted of a tru&s;t,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>we ought not to betray it. If we had gone over to HAMET, when he fir&s;t declared again&s;t his brother, he would have received us with joy, and probably have rewarded our &s;er|vice; but I know, that his virtue
<PB N="145" REF="151">
will abhor us for treachery, though practi&s;ed in his favour: treachery, under the dominion of HAMET, will not only cover us with di&s;honour, but will probably devote us to death.</Q></P>
<P>In this rea&s;oning, Caled could not but acquie&s;ce; he felt him&s;elf &s;ecretly but forcibly reproved, by the &s;uperior virtue of O&s;myn: and while he regret|ted his having made a propo&s;al, which had been rejected not only as impru|dent but infamous; he concluded, that O&s;myn would ever after &s;u&s;pect and de&s;pi&s;e him; and he, therefore, from a new cau&s;e, conceived new enmity again&s;t him. They parted, however, without any appearance of &s;u&s;picion
<PB N="146" REF="152">
or di&s;gu&s;t; and, in a &s;hort time, they were in circum&s;tances very different from their expectations.</P>
