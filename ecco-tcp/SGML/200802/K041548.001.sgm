<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following productions have already experienced &s;o much indulgence from the Public, that in &s;ending them thus collected into the world, I &s;hould feel, perhaps, more of confidence than apprehen&s;ion, were I not perfectly convinced that temporary favour is no deci&s;ive proof of real de|&s;ert.</P>
<P>Whatever the future fate of the&s;e performances may be, I am aware that it mu&s;t depend upon them&s;elves alone; and I &s;hall not trouble my reader with
<PB N="x" REF="9">
any vain attempt to enhance their merits, or palliate their defects.</P>
<P>Yet concerning one cla&s;s of poems in the collection, it may be proper to &s;ay a few words, as &s;ome critics have expected to find in them much more than their author intended&mdash;I mean the e&s;&s;ays on different arts. In the&s;e it was by no means my de&s;ign to a&s;|&s;ume the office of a legi&s;lator; not only from a ju&s;t diffidence in my own power of framing &s;uch laws, but from a per&s;ua&s;ion that in poetry they &s;eldom prove either plea&s;ing or u&s;eful.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, I believe, of all di|dactic poems, that the parts of them which do not pretend to teach, are the mo&s;t productive of plea&s;ure, and per|haps of utility.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="10">
Paradoxical as this may appear, I am convinced, that in compo&s;itions relating to the fine arts it is &s;trictly true. A collection of precepts, tho' expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t elegant ver&s;e, can never make either a Painter or a Poet; who&s;e productions, to u&s;e the words of a great hi&s;torian, would ex|cite le&s;s admiration, if they could be created by the le&s;&s;ons of a preceptor.</P>
<P>Rules of art are in general &s;o trite or fallacious, that they rather tend to tire and mi&s;lead than to animate and direct.&mdash;Let us con&s;ider, for in&s;tance, the Art of Poetry by Boileau, which is ju&s;tly &s;aid to be &s;uperior to its ri|vals.&mdash;If we examine the mere pre|cepts contained in this admirable Poem, &s;ome of them are &s;uch as a
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
Poet would certainly be neglected for ob&s;erving, and others only &s;uch as mu&s;t occur to every writer of a &s;ound under&s;tanding.&mdash;They are indeed em|belli&s;hed with all the graces of for|cible and highly-poli&s;hed expre&s;&s;ion; yet &s;urely the mo&s;t engaging and u&s;e|ful parts of this celebrated work, are its lively images and characters; which, by animating the compo&s;ition, in|&s;pire an enthu&s;ia&s;tic e&s;teem for the art and its profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Concerning the real u&s;e of rules, opinions have been very different.&mdash;Some have even imputed the decline of art to the accumulation of pre|cepts; while others have thought &s;o highly of their power, as to imagine that no one can produce a good Poem,
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
without being acquainted with the Poetics of Ari&s;totle; which is, in truth, like imagining that no one can be|come a parent without peru&s;ing a trea|ti&s;e of anatomy.</P>
<P>Tho' I confe&s;s my&s;elf inclined to doubt the efficacy of precepts towards forming a great arti&s;t of any kind, I am far from intending to condemn the poems, that have appeared on a preceptive plan.&mdash;Many of the&s;e are written in a manner &s;o &s;prightly, and with &s;uch an elegant felicity of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, that if they do not afford to young &s;tudents that new and &s;olid in|&s;truction which they profe&s;s to de|liver, they are at lea&s;t highly plea&s;ing; and certainly very &s;erviceable to that more numerous cla&s;s of readers, the critics and connoi&s;&s;eurs.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="13">
It was, however, my wi&s;h to render my own Poems, on different arts, more <HI>hi&s;torical</HI> than <HI>preceptive.</HI></P>
<P>My principal de&s;ign was to pre|&s;ent a general view of the art in que&s;|tion, with a ju&s;t and animating cha|racter of its mo&s;t eminent profe&s;&s;ors. There is, I believe, a &s;ea&s;on of life, in which Poems of this nature may be read with the happie&s;t effect.&mdash;The fir&s;t, and perhaps the mo&s;t important &s;tep towards forming a great Arti&s;t in any line, is to in&s;pire a youth of quick feelings with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic pa&s;&s;ion for &s;ome particular art, and with an ingenuous delight, in the glory of its Heroes.</P>
<P>Such was the end that I propo&s;ed to my&s;elf in the&s;e e&s;&s;ays; for, as de|licate
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
or incon&s;tant health, and the love of literary retirement, have pre|vented me from &s;erving the commu|nity in &s;cenes of active life, I have con&s;idered it as particularly incum|bent on me to endeavour at lea&s;t, in my poetical pur&s;uits, to promote the intere&s;t of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I am aware that &s;uch an idea is open to much raillery, as vain and romantic; but Poetry is an art, which conduces &s;o little to the private emo|lument and advantage of tho&s;e who devote even a life to it, that they ought, I think, to be indulged in &s;uch pro&s;pects, however chimerical, as ari&s;e only from a benevolent vanity.</P>
<P>In clo&s;ing this Preface, it may be proper to &s;ay, that the collection con|tains
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
nothing which has not appeared before, except an Ode to that elegant and in&s;tructive female author the Counte&s;s of Genlis, with a few &s;hort and occa&s;ional compo&s;itions, in&s;erted at the end of the fir&s;t volume.</P>

<P>Don Diego Vela&s;quez de Silva, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of the Spani&s;h Painters, was born at Seville, 1594, and clos'd his honourable and &s;plendid life at Madrid in 1660.&mdash;His ma&s;ter was Pacheco, a Spaniard, who united the &s;i&s;ter arts of Painting and Poetry.&mdash;Vela&s;|quez was patronized by the famous Olivarez, and had the honour of painting our Charles the Fir&s;t, during his vi&s;it at Madrid: perhaps he contributed not a lit|tle to form the ta&s;te and pa&s;&s;ion for art, by which that Prince was &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed. The Spani&s;h Painter ro&s;e to great honours in his own country, and had, like Rubens, the &s;ingular fortune to unite the cha|racter of an Amba&s;&s;ador with that of an Arti&s;t, being &s;ent on an extraordinary commi&s;&s;ion, in 1648, to Pope Innocent X.</P>
<P>One of his mo&s;t &s;triking hi&s;torical pictures, was the expul&s;ion of the Moors from Spain; a noble, national &s;ubject, which he painted for Philip the Third, in com|petition
<PB N="76" REF="91">
with three Arti&s;ts of reputation, and obtained the preference.</P>
<P>But he is particularly celebrated for the &s;pirit and energy of his Portraits; concerning which there are two &s;ingular ancedotes related by his Spani&s;h Biogra|pher; and the following may po&s;&s;ibly amu&s;e the reader:</P>
<P>In 1639, he executed a portrait of Don Adrian Pulido Pareja, Commander in chief of an armament appointed to New Spain; and plea&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o well in the execution, that he affixed his name to the pic|ture; a circum&s;tance not u&s;ual with him. He had painted with pencils of uncommon length, for the &s;ake of working at a greater di&s;tance, and with peculiar force; &s;o that the picture (&s;ays my Spani&s;h author) when near, is not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, and at a di&s;tance, is a miracle. As Vela&s;quez, after this portrait was fi|ni&s;hed, was at work in the palace, the King, as u&s;ual, went privately to his apartment to &s;ee him paint; when ob&s;erving the figure of Pareja, and taking it for the real per&s;on, he exclaimed with &s;urprize, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What! are you &s;till here? have you not your di&s;patches? and why are you not gone?"</Q> But &s;oon perceiving his mi&s;take, he turn'd to Vela&s;quez (who mode&s;tly doubt|ed the reality of the deception) and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t to you it deceived me."</Q>&mdash;For this &s;tory, &s;uch as it is, I am indebted to the author whom I have quoted in the preced ng Note. The celebrated Murillo, who&s;e pictures are much better known in England than tho&s;e of his ma&s;ter, was a di&s;ciple of Vela&s;quez.</P>

Indeed the per&s;onal hi&s;tory of Mengs may tend to confirm this idea. He was originally made a painter and a drudge, by the tyranny of a cruel father; and though he applied him&s;elf inten&s;ely through life to the practice and theory of his art, he &s;eems never to have attained that felicity of performance, which can per|haps belong only to tho&s;e, who devote them&s;elves to a favorite art in the happy ardour of uncon&s;trained af|fection.

<P>But there may be no ju&s;t ground of complaint again&s;t the integrity of the colourman, and this failure may perhaps ari&s;e from the arti&s;t's mixing his colours, and their vehicles, in improper propor|tions to each other; that is, in&s;tead of painting with oil properly thickened with colour, u&s;ing oil only fully &s;tained with it, to which a proper con&s;i&s;tence (or body, as the painters call it) is given by &s;trong gum varni&s;hes; in &s;hort, u&s;ing more vehicle than colour; by which, although mo&s;t brilliant and tran&s;parent effects may be produced, yet the particles of colour are too much attenuated, and divided from each other, and con&s;equently le&s;s able to with|&s;tand the de&s;tructive action of light. If the defici|ency
<PB N="96" REF="111">
complained of originates from this &s;ource, the Academy, by a careful cour&s;e of experiments, may be able clearly to a&s;certain what preparations of the more delicate colours are mo&s;t durable; what oils and varni&s;hes will be&s;t pre&s;erve the original brilliancy of the paint; what are the be&s;t propor|tions for this purpo&s;e in which they can be u&s;ed; and how far glazing (that almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible temptation to oil-painters) may or may not be depended on. All the&s;e points are at pre&s;ent &s;o far from being known with certainty, that perhaps there are not two Painters, who think perfectly alike on any one of them. The author hopes, that the gentlemen of the pencil will pardon his pre&s;uming to offer a hint on this delicate &s;ubject, with which he does not pretend to be intimately acquainted. The ideas, which he has thus ventured to addre&s;s to them, ari&s;e only from the mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h, that future ages may have a ju&s;t and adequate &s;en&s;e of the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of Painting in England in the reign of George the Third, and that our pre&s;ent ex|cellent arti&s;ts may not be reduced to depend on the uncertain hand of the engraver for the e&s;teem of po&s;terity.</P>

She was, however, impri&s;oned, but &s;oon relea&s;ed; and dying nine years after her father, at the age of thirty-&s;ix, was buried at St. Dun&s;tan's, in Canterbury. The head of her father, which &s;he had pre&s;erved, with religious veneration, in a box of

<P>The character of this amiable woman is happily drawn both by Addi&s;on and Walpole.&mdash;She mar|ried, at the age of twenty, William Roper, E&s;quire, of Kent, to the infinite &s;atisfaction of her father; for &s;he &s;eems to have been the deare&s;t object of his parental affection, which is very &s;trongly marked in his letters addre&s;&s;ed to her. She was indeed mo&s;t eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed by her learning, in an age when the graces of the mind were regarded as an e&s;&s;ential article in female education: but the beauty and force of her filial piety reflects a &s;till &s;uperior lu&s;tre on this accompli&s;hed woman.&mdash;There is more than one pa&s;&s;age in her life, which would fur|ni&s;h an admirable &s;ubject for the pencil. Her in|terviw with her father, on his return to the Tower, is mentioned as &s;uch by Mr. Walpole.</P>

<L>And bade me go look in &s;ome little thatch'd hut.</L>
<L>I march'd to the Villager's lowly abode,</L>
<L>'Twas a &s;nug pretty cottage, and &s;tood near the road:</L>
<L>And here a good woman, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, tho' humble,</L>
<L>A face that could frown, and a tongue that would grumble,</L>
<L>Said&mdash;the per&s;on I a&s;k'd for had lodg'd in her cot,</L>
<L>But, alas! &s;uch good luck was no longer her lot;</L>
<L>For &s;he quitted her roof, where &s;he oft had repos'd,</L>
<L>When yon great hou&s;e was built, and the common inclos'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I conceiv'd, as I now bade the village farewell,</L>
<L>With the mild &s;ons of Science this Godde&s;s mu&s;t dwell;</L>
<L>But tho&s;e, where I &s;ought &s;ome obliging in&s;tructor,</L>
<L>Were &s;quabbling about an electric conductor.</L>
<L><PB N="193" REF="201">
Some cry'd up the point; &s;ome commended the ball;</L>
<L>The &s;oft breath of Science was turn'd to a &s;quall:</L>
<L>The Sages no mental conductor could find</L>
<L>To draw off the flame that now fla&s;h'd on their mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In ha&s;te I exclaim'd, to the Learned adieu!</L>
<L>For e'en Science offends, when &s;he talks like a &s;hrew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Having wander'd &s;o wide of the object I &s;ought,</L>
<L>I was now led to think, and rejoic'd at the thought,</L>
<L>This Godde&s;s (her&s;elf for her charms &s;o renown'd)</L>
<L>With the daughters of Beauty mu&s;t &s;urely be found:</L>
<L>With this hope I approach'd (unperceiv'd by them all)</L>
<L>Three lovely young girls ju&s;t array'd for the ball;</L>
<L>In each, who&s;e bright eyes on a mirror were bent,</L>
<L>I thought I di&s;cover'd a &s;park of Content;</L>
<L>But watching them more, in their beautiful faces,</L>
<L>Of the godde&s;s I &s;ought I no more &s;aw the traces;</L>
<L>For as they &s;urvey'd, with a critical glance,</L>
<L>The elegant MONTAGU move in the dance,</L>
<L>In her exqui&s;ite figure &s;uch graces were &s;hewn,</L>
<L>That viewing her charms they di&s;tru&s;ted their own.</L>
<L><PB N="194" REF="202">
Thou gentle&s;t of nymphs! while thy triumphs in|crea&s;e,</L>
<L>Uncon&s;cious of beauty, &s;o fatal to peace!</L>
<L>Tho' the &s;parks of Content in one &s;ex thou may'&s;t &s;mother,</L>
<L>Bright Ec&s;ta&s;y's flame thou wilt rai&s;e in the other.</L>
<L>If in bo&s;om parental Content could re&s;ide,</L>
<L>The heart of thy parent this trea&s;ure mu&s;t hide;</L>
<L>But, alas! 'tis a truth which all parents lament,</L>
<L>Their tender anxiety &s;tifles Content.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O tell me, while vainly to find thee I pant,</L>
<L>Dear latent Divinity! where is thy haunt?</L>
<L>"Away to Bathea&s;ton," Good-nature replies,</L>
<L>"Behold &s;he there weaves the poetical prize."</L>
<L>With thy Myrtle, kind MILLER! O let me be crown'd,</L>
<L>Then my &s;earch is repaid, and the Godde&s;s is found:</L>
<L>Nay, if to another your wreath you a&s;&s;ign,</L>
<L>And give it to ver&s;e far &s;uperior to mine,</L>
<L>My &s;earch's dear object I &s;till mu&s;t attain,</L>
<L>And the proof of this wonder's exceedingly plain,</L>
<L><PB N="195" REF="203">
It re&s;ts on this maxim, by Horace invented,</L>
<L>The Bard who writes wor&s;t is the Bard mo&s;t con|tented.</L>
<L>My claim to this ble&s;&s;ing thus made very clear,</L>
<L>If I've nothing to hope, I have nothing to fear;</L>
<L>For MILLER can plea&s;e while the mind &s;he amu&s;es,</L>
<L>Both when &s;he be&s;tows, and e'en when &s;he refu&s;es;</L>
<L>In truth I &s;u&s;pect, from her &s;ingular aim,</L>
<L>The Godde&s;s I &s;eek is conceal'd by her name:</L>
<L>She her&s;elf is Content, and her hou&s;e is the fane,</L>
<L>Where Spleen and Ill-nature no favours obtain:</L>
<L>Some mortals in vain for admi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t pray,</L>
<L>But all who once enter go &s;miling away.</L>
