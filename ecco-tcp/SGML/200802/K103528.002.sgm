<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF TATE WILKINSON.</HEAD>
<P>THE winter of the year 1758, was pro|ductive of many material theatrical revo|lutions. A &s;udden and unfore&s;een &s;troke hap|pened at Drury-Lane, by the unexpected lo&s;s of Mr. Woodward, the entire &s;upport of all the comedies where Mr. Garrick was not con|cerned, as his Marplot, Foppington, Sir Fop|ling Flutter, Duretete, bore te&s;timony; and he was of great importance in many where Mr. Garrick <HI>was</HI> principal; &s;uch as his never equalled Bobadil and Mercutio, Mr. Garrick being Kitely and Romeo; all the pantomime depart|ment re&s;ted entirely on the &s;houlders of Wood|ward. In &s;hort, the lo&s;s of that gentleman was &s;uch, as put &s;o dangerous a hatchet to the tree as made the old bark to tremble, not only for its
<PB N="4" REF="4">
branches; but an alarm even of the cutting up the root of the venerable oak, that had flouri&s;hed on that &s;acred &s;pot, and which had been dedicated to the Mu&s;es for ages, and &s;tood many a threaten|ing bla&s;t and tempe&s;t. Had they not at that junc|ture been remarkably feeble at Covent-Garden, by the lo&s;s of Barry and others, the tears of Old Madam Drury would have had additional cau&s;e to flow. Woodward, not to his prai&s;e or wi&s;dom be it recorded, left his enviable &s;ituation, being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every comfort and affluence, and &s;ecure of the hearts and &s;miles of the public, and on terms of amity with Mr. Garrick; yet with all the&s;e advantages he fled, which he never re|pented but once, and that for altogether. Wood|ward and Barry &s;educed from both the theatres, Mr. and Mrs. Walker, formerly Mi&s;s Minors, (both living now I believe) Mr. Jeffer&s;on, Mr. Vernon, and al&s;o &s;everal u&s;eful performers, a &s;evere cut in a regular catalogue of &s;tock-acting plays.</P>
<P>That the lo&s;s of &s;o many performers, with Woodward at the head of &s;uch a de&s;ertion from the royal &s;tandard, was con&s;iderably felt is certain; but Garrick's name was a tower of &s;trength: He therefore in a great degree &s;topped the breach by his own force, pre&s;enting him&s;elf early after this revolt, not only in his characters of never failing
<PB N="5" REF="5">
command of attraction, but by producing him|&s;elf as a new Marplot, &amp;c. and this cha&s;m in his theatrical army, obliged him as a wi&s;e general to be more pliant, and enter into an engagement with Foote on his own terms, with me to act in his diver&s;ions of the morning. Revolutions in the real &s;tate, occa&s;ion the &s;ame compliance from policy, and like Mr. Bayes's Rehear&s;al has its &s;udden changes of government; in&s;tances need not be tra|ced to &s;hew the <HI>ins</HI> and the <HI>outs.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Garrick had that year, during the &s;ummer vacation, met accidentally with a young gentle|man, an intimate friend of mine, with whom (on the lo&s;s of Woodward) he took infinite pains, and formed a great partiality and friend&s;hip for him. He made his fir&s;t appearance that year at Drury-Lane in Captain Brazen, in the Recruit|ing Officer, early in the month of October. I dined that day with my old acquaintance Mrs. Wier, near Pall-Mall (mentioned long before) of Harrow; to this lady I &s;hall again have occa&s;ion to recur. With Mrs. Wier lodged not a young lady, though named <HI>Mi&s;s</HI> Roach, and in truth, an affected, bold, <HI>artful,</HI> (I dare not &s;ay plain) rude, di&s;agreeable, woman; with Mrs. Wier di|ned al&s;o Mr. Baker, manager of the York com|pany. Here I refer to an in&s;tance in the early part of this work; and remark how u&s;eful at|tentive
<PB N="6" REF="6">
civility turns out, from whence there can be no rea&s;on at the time to expect an advantage. My good behaviour, when I was thirteen or four|teen years old to this Mrs. Wier, grew into a la&s;ting e&s;teem which continued the acquaintance, and was the whole and &s;ole occa&s;ion of bringing about, by that accidental meeting, my being ma|nager of the York theatre.</P>
<P>For &s;trangers of any reputation were then never admitted to play at York or Hull; which rule had I abided by, tho&s;e &s;tages had been on a more &s;o|lid foundation than at the pre&s;ent day. I per|ceived while at dinner an oddity of humour and manner in this elderly gentleman, that demanded re&s;pect and e&s;teem; and I al&s;o felt really an at|tachment for his apparent marks of worth and be|nevolence; this led into a &s;trict intimacy, while the old gentleman remained his few days in London.&mdash;He wi&s;hed I would vi&s;it him at York as a friend (I was not known at that time in London as a performer); and I regretted the lo&s;s of that worthy character when he left the capital. After dinner we took a coach from Pall-Mall to the theatre, and when arrived there hun|dreds were on their return&mdash;No room&mdash;no room, was the cry from every part of the hou&s;e! Mr. Baker, with the ladies returned home; but, I from privilege, of cour&s;e had admi&s;&s;ion behind the &s;cenes.
<PB N="7" REF="7">
My friend was received with candour, warmth, and univer&s;al applau&s;e; his per&s;on and manners were uncommonly genteel, and highly fini&s;hed. A good repre&s;entation of the real Fine Gentleman, it is often lamented, is rarely &s;een on the &s;tage, and to the truth of that ob&s;ervation I &s;ubmit; but at the &s;ame time let it be noticed, that in per&s;ons of the fir&s;t &s;tation in life, aided with every requi&s;ite accompli&s;hment, all the nece&s;&s;ary ingredi|ents are &s;eldom conjoined either in the real Fine Gentleman or the real Fine Lady, &s;o as to equal the expan&s;e of our ideas. Read Sir Charles Grandi&s;on and we &s;hall find the poet has furni&s;h|ed him with a hand&s;ome and accompli&s;hed per&s;on, his mind with manline&s;s, ta&s;te, feeling, genero&s;ity, courage, di&s;cretion, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with all the arts and aids of education: But few, very few &s;uch para|gons have been really &s;een, though, like the uni|corn, &s;uch exaltation of the mind and per&s;on may perchance exi&s;t. Now an actor of under|&s;tanding, and education, mu&s;t certainly be in a good &s;chool for attaining ea&s;e, who performs before hundreds nightly, and part of that collect|ed audience con&s;i&s;ting of the fir&s;t per&s;onages; and it is po&s;&s;ible the be&s;t &s;peaker in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons if put really to act on the &s;tage would feel not only awkward, but likely inferior in point of
<PB N="8" REF="8">
freedom and expre&s;&s;ion to the actor, even in the repre&s;entation of the Gentleman.</P>
<P>The true Fine Gentleman is an arduous ta&s;k to attain in the mo&s;t exalted &s;tate, and rarely to be viewed near perfection (unle&s;s as vi&s;ionary) either at the court, the bar, army, pulpit, or the &s;tage. Indeed at the palace, ea&s;e, elegance of manners, and liberal education, with every attendant ac|compli&s;hment mu&s;t give the true&s;t poli&s;h and de|portment, and &s;hine more con&s;picuous there than in any other department of life, as certainly the great circle will ever be the only criterion of true ta&s;te and fa&s;hion. But let us be informed of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed character at any period, and enter our &s;enate purpo&s;ely to view the per&s;on and man|ners of the paragon &s;o famous and extolled, I think from ob&s;ervation I may almo&s;t venture to affirm the reality would certainly fall far &s;hort of expectation. As a point in proof, about eight years ago I had the opportunity of hearing a great man's maiden &s;peech in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons: The tones of voice &s;eemed truly captivat|ing (though he &s;poke not <HI>at that time</HI> in favour of court politics) my &s;ituation was &s;uch I could not at the in&s;tant gain a glimp&s;e at the fa&s;cinating pro|digy. But when afterwards, with infinite pains and difficulty, that &s;atisfaction was obtained&mdash;Lo!
<Q><L>How the great man le&s;&s;en'd to my view.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">
The rea&s;on is demon&s;trative, true perfection is &s;eldom found in Nature's works, &s;o many requi|&s;ites being nece&s;&s;ary to the combination, renders it as difficult to find as the longitude. The late Lord Che&s;terfield employed his pen over numer|ous pages to illu&s;trate this; yet with all his know|ledge, labour, and pains, he could not create or reali&s;e. In &s;hort, the real Fine Gentleman may truly be termed the phoenix, and that phoenix rare, Great Britain, in our pre&s;ent golden days, may boa&s;t ri&s;ing daily to full bloom, adorned with every art, humanity, and honour, that can fill the noble brea&s;t. <HI>Would</HI> the Lord Che&s;terfield (ju&s;t mentioned) could be re&s;tored to one hour's life, he then might clo&s;e his eyes with tran&s;port, and from his quivering lips proclaim, he beheld all his boundle&s;s wi&s;hes gratified, when he viewed his <HI>fa|vourite graces</HI> all united in
<Q>The PRINCE of WALES.</Q></P>
<P>But to return, the young hero who played Capt. Brazen had more ea&s;e than any young or old actor I ever remember, and in drawing his &s;word he threw all other performers at a wonderful di&s;tance by his &s;wiftne&s;s, ea&s;e, grace, and &s;uperior elegance; to him, was Mr. Garrick afterwards much indebted for the applau&s;e he received in Hamlet in the &s;en|cing
<PB N="10" REF="10">
&s;cene with Laertes, as he performed that cha|racter, and there 'twas vi&s;ible Mr. Garrick's pu|pil was the ma&s;ter. After the play was fini&s;hed I paid my re&s;pects to the young gentleman, re|turned back to my company, and gave them an exact de&s;cription of the new adventurer's good fortune, which I did with true plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mr. Baker was &s;eldom in London, but came to &s;upply the lo&s;s of the York heroine Mrs. Dan|cer, after that Mrs. Barry, now Mrs. Crawford, who had eloped with Mr. Dancer to Barry's new Dublin theatre, by a repair of coar&s;e plai&s;ter, in engaging the goblin Mi&s;s Roach, a horrid &s;pectre, as a &s;ub&s;titute for Mrs. Dancer with her merit, and then in her prime of life. Mi&s;s Roach how|ever undertook to be the York Lady Townly, &amp;c. But when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he made her appearance, was &s;o indif|ferently received, that in con&s;equence of it, I do not believe &s;he acted three nights the whole &s;ea|&s;on. She had a good benefit, and that <HI>extorted</HI> by really good acting, as &s;he attended ma&s;s con|&s;tantly and &s;o devoutly, that &s;he was thought a &s;aint, though little nun's fle&s;h in her compo&s;ition; for the would have debauched a whole convent. She had much art, a cunning under&s;tanding, and a flow of &s;pirits, yet affectation that would have been &s;urfeiting in a beauty; but &s;he flattered well, and to flatter well requires &s;tudy and caution&mdash;if well done there is no doubt of its being glibly
<PB N="11" REF="11">
&s;wallowed. She however wheedled Mr. Baker into a belief &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great abilities, and the public, that &s;he was a good woman&mdash;but it mu&s;t have been without her head.</P>
<P>Before the middle of October, Mr. Foote had &s;ettled preliminaries with Mr. Garrick for his two exotics (as he called Mr. Foote and my&s;elf) to appear in the &s;ame piece. Mr. Foote then re|que&s;ted me to do Bounce, as a pupil to Mr. Puzzle, in the Diver&s;ions of the Morning, a part I had re|fu&s;ed when in Dublin; but now as an old &s;tager, from my practice at Port&s;mouth, and being in health and vigour, I had not the &s;ame excu&s;e or objection, though it was a fatiguing &s;cene. It was adverti&s;ed in the following manner:
<Q>DIVERSIONS OF THE MORNING. <LB>Principal Characters, <LIST>
<ITEM>Mr. FOOTE,</ITEM>

</LIST></Q>
 Without my fir&s;t appearance, which certainly was unkind and unprecedented, as it did not introduce me to the candour of the public, which they ever grant to a young performer and novice on the &s;tage. However this is an after thought; for I was at
<PB N="12" REF="12">
that time highly gratified with the large letters in which my name was printed, a foible natural to every candidate. Soon after this farce was known by the town to be in rehear&s;al, &s;ome Mrs. Can|dour gave my friend Mrs. Woffington the alarm, who &s;till lived and exi&s;ted on the flattering hopes of once more captivating the public by her remaining rays of beauty (born to bloom and fade); and who declared &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed on hearing I had &s;ur|vived my pre&s;umption in Ireland, in daring (to be the devil in her likene&s;s there) to take her off. Colo|nel Cae&s;ar of the guards, who it was whi&s;pered at that time was &s;ecretly married to Mrs. Woffing|ton, had been, as mentioned, at Port&s;mouth the night of my benefit, when the Duke of York and mo&s;t of the principal gentlemen of the army in the kingdom were at that time a&s;&s;embled, and were mo&s;t forcibly &s;truck with the &s;udden and high en|tertainment they received by &s;eeing their favourite Woffington where &s;he was &s;o little expected; and indeed the exactne&s;s of manner rendered it cer|tainly as a performance of that kind, far beyond mediocrity.</P>
<P>She was &s;o alarmed on Mrs. Candour's intelli|gence, and not without foundation of truth, of my being engaged, and wor&s;e than all to make my fir&s;t appearance conjunctively with Foote at Drury-Lane; that &s;he thought it highly prudent
<PB N="13" REF="13">
for her &s;ame and peace, from what materials of intelligence &s;he had collected as to the imitation of her&s;elf in Dublin, to endeavour by every means of &s;ubtlety and force to counteract, prevent, and by authority put an effectual &s;top to &s;uch a pro|cedure, which &s;he judged would hurt her mind: All this was natural&mdash;mo&s;t per&s;ons would do the &s;ame for the mo&s;t trivial cau&s;e, and this in fact was no more than trifling&mdash;Not any per&s;on likes to be a &s;ubject of ridicule. When &s;he was fir&s;t made acquainted with my appearance in Queen Dollallolla, &s;he declared by the living God, &s;he was amazed <Q REND="inline">"the fellow was not &s;toned to death in Dublin!"</Q> But her own treatment of me might have fully convinced her, that ill-nature is too apt to find countenance, particularly if ex|citing contemptuous merriment.</P>
<P>On deliberation Mrs. Woffington deputed Col. Cae&s;ar to wait on Mr. Garrick; he related his objections in point of delicacy and honour concern|ing any affront, however &s;light, reflectedly thrown on that lady. He &s;aid to Mr. Garrick, he &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed if young Wilkin&s;on had &s;ucce&s;s on &s;uch an attempt; for, without the &s;anction of a London audience to render it fa&s;hionable, he knew it was po&s;&s;ible, having been a witne&s;s to his &s;aid imitation at Port&s;mouth; and as the &s;ame per|formance might render her, as an actre&s;s, ridicu|lous,
<PB N="14" REF="14">
and as &s;he was at that time under his pro|tection, his intention as a vi&s;itor to Mr. Garrick was to inform him, if he permitted &s;uch proce|dure or achievement from Mr. Wilkin&s;on on his &s;tage, he mu&s;t expect from him (Col. Cae&s;ar) to be &s;eriou&s;ly called upon as a gentleman to an&s;wer it. Mr. Garrick immediately not only acquie&s;ced, but expre&s;&s;ed a dete&s;tation of any &s;uch perform|ance, <HI>(ble&s;s his good nature)</HI> and I actually believe would not have been di&s;plea&s;ed with receiving an order from the Lord Chamberlain, for a prohibi|tion of the whole of Mr. Foote's or my exhibi|tion, had it not proved at that juncture very con|venient to make every &s;hew of novelty to attract the town to his grand London principal booth of the fair. My appearing at all, and the being attended to, was neither Mr. Garrick's wi&s;h nor intention, if to my advantage; he therefore will|ingly obeyed the Colonel's mandate in behalf of his <HI>once</HI> lovely and admired Peggy. Indeed he could have done no le&s;s to &s;ave appearances, for where he had formerly &s;o profe&s;&s;edly avowed a tender pa&s;&s;ion. Mr. Garrick coincided in opi|nion, that &s;uch an attempt on the merits of Mrs. Woffington's acting would be illiberal and un|warrantable in the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>The day before the piece was to be acted he &s;ummoned Foote and me, and related the above|mentioned
<PB N="15" REF="15">
particulars, and informed us that his word and honour was engaged to Colonel Cae&s;ar that Mr. Wilkin&s;on &s;hould not take the liberty to make any line, &s;peech, or manner, relative to Mrs. Woffington, or pre&s;ume to offer or occa&s;ion any &s;urmi&s;e of likene&s;s, &s;o as to give the lea&s;t &s;hadow of offence, on any account whatever. This I &s;ub&s;cribed to on Mr. Garrick's commands, and Mr. Foote became my bail for the &s;ame&mdash;for Gar|rick was really on this matter very unea&s;y with Foote and Wilkin&s;on, his d&mdash;d exotics.</P>
<P>Mrs. Woffington I &s;hall &s;eldom have to review again in the&s;e &s;heets; and if the reader recollects, I have not been &s;paring of her good qualities, either as an actre&s;s or a woman: what I have mentioned as to my&s;elf is only what belongs to my hi&s;tory, but no pique from what had long ago pa&s;&s;ed; and hope when &s;he died, if &s;he favoured me with a thought, &s;he forgave me as I now do her: for had I been in her place I think I might and &s;hould, too probably, have acted the &s;ame as &s;he did. And by the &s;ame rule, had Mrs. Wof|fington been Mr. Wilkin&s;on &s;he might not have acted with &s;o little &s;pleen&mdash;but that perhaps the reader will &s;ay is a compliment to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Diver&s;ions of the Morning was at length produced in October, and to an overflowing the|atre.&mdash;Curio&s;ity was univer&s;ally rai&s;ed, to &s;ee Mr.
<PB N="26" REF="16">
Foote's pupil, as I was called, and to this hour by many believed. Mr. Foote's acquaintance were numerous, and of the fir&s;t circles; and he took every precaution and care for his own &s;ake (for fear of failure or party) to have me &s;trongly &s;upported, and he blazed forth Wilkin&s;on's won|derful merit, as on my &s;ucce&s;s he intended what he put into execution, which was, to give me the labouring oar and make my&s;elf a number of im|placable enemies; and as to the money I brought, he judged it only &s;afe and fit for his own emolu|ment.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd act of the farce <HI>he,</HI> &s;urrounded by his pupils, (as Mr. Puzzle, their in&s;tructor, called me on as Mr. Wilkin&s;on)&mdash;Mr. Wilkin|&s;on!&mdash;I was received with every plea&s;ing token by the fir&s;t audience in the world for candour and liberality&mdash;for &s;uch London certainly is when un|bia&s;&s;ed;&mdash;it mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly commands and de&s;erves that appellation.&mdash;I found my&s;elf much more alarmed than I expected I &s;hould have been, for the very name of a London audience &s;trikes terror to the performer; but that as well as other au|diences are not always judges for them&s;elves: for party, &s;pleen, envy, hatred, and malice can form &s;o many different opinions, which, &s;cattered like rat&s;bane up and down the pit, without pre&s;erving their own re&s;pect, as may, and often does, with
<PB N="27" REF="17">
wanton cruelty de&s;troy many an actor and actre&s;s. The&s;e things (ble&s;&s;ed be God) only &s;ometimes happen and will again.&mdash;In&s;tances may be given not to be denied.</P>
<P>The &s;cene between Mr. Foote and my&s;elf went off with great <HI>eclat;</HI> on my departure from the &s;tage, while he did his puppets, &amp;c. the audience grew very impatient by &s;eeing my exit, and judged that was all the new actor was to do; and feeling a di&s;appointment, from murmuring they grew im|patient, and at la&s;t bur&s;t out into vehemently a&s;k|ing for Wilkin&s;on, and de&s;iring to be informed if that was the only performance they were to ex|pect from that young gentleman? This loud in|terruption was not paying him his accu&s;tomed at|tention, and he &s;eemed much nettled; however, he bowed, and &s;aid the new performer was only retired for a little re&s;pite nece&s;&s;ary for his follow|ing part of the entertainment. This an&s;wer was approved, and Mr. Foote was proceeding, but the little clamour had reached and di&s;turbed the minds of the gods, and John Bull, as well as their god|&s;hips, thinking Mr. Foote meant to deprive them of part of their rights, though they could not tell what, as they had not all heard Mr. Foote's apo|logy di&s;tinctly, again repeated, <Q REND="inline">"Wilkin&s;on! Wil|kin&s;on!"</Q>&mdash;Foote at this &s;econd interruption grew really offended, and having &s;ecured the lower
<PB N="18" REF="18">
hou&s;e, he &s;topped and &s;aid to Mr. Manly (Hol|land who was on the &s;tage with him) <Q REND="inline">"Did you ever hear &s;uch fellows? D&mdash;n it, they want the fifth act of a play before the &s;econd is over!"</Q>&mdash;And as what he &s;aid generally pa&s;&s;ed current, this occa&s;ioned an univer&s;al roar, and all went on peaceably, and with great good humour, till the appointed time for my &s;econd entrance, which was near the conclu&s;ion&mdash;the people, eager to applaud they knew not why or what, but full of expectation that &s;ome &s;trange performance was to be produced&mdash;and, indeed, to give an account of the approbation, the &s;udden effect, the ince&s;&s;ant laughter, would argue &s;o much of the fabuli&s;t, and of dear &s;elf, that it would &s;urfeit even me to read; and if &s;o, how would an entire &s;tranger feel! why treat it with an angry or contemptuous opinion!&mdash;Therefore let it &s;uffice, that every thing &s;ucceeded that night that could gratify the pride, vanity, and mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes of a young man greedy for fame. The farce fini&s;hed with my performance, and Mr. Foote on my bow made his own, not attempting to proceed, and was him&s;elf in great raptures for rea&s;ons before hinted at; but when the curtain was down he went on and a&s;&s;ured the audience he was much honoured by their approbation, and with their permi&s;&s;ion would the next night repeat the &s;ame
<PB N="19" REF="19">
piece again&mdash;which they had expected he would do, and returned the u&s;ual tokens of their appro|bation.</P>

<P>The next night the hou&s;e was jammed in every part&mdash;the morning of which it was &s;trongly ru|moured that the actors of Covent Garden were highly enraged&mdash;that Mr. Sparks in particular was really di&s;ordered on the occa&s;ion&mdash;Mr. Holland called at the theatre and informed Mr. Garrick and Mr. Foote, he had actually heard that Mr. Sparks was &s;o much hurt and unhappy, that he had taken to his bed and was dangerou&s;ly ill;&mdash;Foote immediately replied (in his laughing man|ner) that it could not be true, or, that it mu&s;t be a d&mdash;d lie; for he had met his wife with two pounds of mutton-chops on a &s;kewer for her hu&s;|band's dinner. This impromptu occa&s;ioned a hearty green-room laugh: for though the actors in general di&s;liked Foote at that time, and ever did until he was a manager <HI>(a wonderful in&s;tance</HI>

<HI>indeed!)</HI> as they did not reli&s;h his writings on ac|count of the freedoms he often took with the pro|fe&s;&s;ion, which always, when introduced, the actors and managers were generally mentioned in a de|grading light; and though he knew the public re|li&s;hed the &s;everity, yet in fact it was not generous or neat to dirty his own ne&s;t in&s;tead of clean&s;ing the theatrical &s;table; and his having been free with the performer's mode of playing, had oc|ca&s;ioned very little regard from any, and from &s;everal a fixed hatred. He had a number of ene|mies in private life: Indeed many dome&s;tic cha|racters &s;everely felt his comic la&s;h, which was &s;marting to tho&s;e on whom it was inflicted; but &s;till his univer&s;al acquaintance, his wit, humour, open hou&s;e, and entertaining qualities, rai&s;ed him &s;uperior to his maligners, and in general he rolled in luxury and indolence. It would have been much more unfa&s;hionable not to have laughed at Foote's jokes than even at Quin's.&mdash;Quin's were moro&s;e, &s;trong, and of a particular vein of humour, like the characters he &s;ucceeded in&mdash;as the Old Bachelor, Apemantus, Sir John Brute, Gardener, Ventidius, Fal&s;taff, &amp;c. each of which bear a likene&s;s of the man; and there were often well-pointed &s;tories related of him in books, &s;uch as Humphrey Clinker, and many like publica|tions, which will either ju&s;tify or condemn my a&s;|&s;ertion.

But Mr. Foote was irre&s;i&s;tible, &s;ponta|neous, and not confined to manner or character; for wherever he aimed his humour and raillery he &s;hot the object as it flew by his quick fancy, and all with a &s;uperior degree to his opponents.</P>
<P>When Mr. Garrick was at the noon rehear&s;als, he ever was on the li&s;ten, and if he heard Foote and the performers joking, would enter all full of whim, and <HI>affected</HI> ea&s;y affability and equality, and made him&s;elf one of the laughing group, and at every je&s;t of Foote's appeared to pay particular tributes of &s;urpri&s;e, applau&s;e, and attention; but when in turn he related what he had &s;tudied and prepared as <HI>very</HI> comical, if the &s;ame repetition of approbation as had gone before attendant to Foote's humour was wanting to his, he has been cut to the &s;oul at finding Foote's &s;uperiority, which was generally the con&s;equence when both were pitched for battle and eager for victory at the game of repartee and &s;parring &s;arca&s;m; and which was frequently granted to Foote by the courtiers and adulators of Garrick, even while depending on the &s;miles of their ma&s;ter, and under the ap|prehen&s;ion of incurring the terror and lo&s;s of fa|vour from offended maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>One great rea&s;on, as a man of wit, for Foote's &s;uperiority on &s;uch convivial meetings was, that he, like tbe American felt bold, knew his &s;uperiority,
<PB N="22" REF="22">
which was rai&s;ed by the perfect knowledge of Gar|rick's fears, and which made Foote &s;o ea&s;y, that he gave not him&s;elf the trouble to hate. Mr. Foote would frequently &s;ay to Mr. Garrick, <Q REND="inline">"Ble&s;s me! we have been laughing away our time; it is pa&s;t three o'clock; have you and Mrs. Garrick enough for a third, without infringing on your &s;ervants genero&s;ity, for I know they are on board wages? be&s;ides, the kitchen-fire may be gone out if it be one of your cold meat days, or if one of Mrs. Garrick's fa&s;t days, I cannot expect a dinner on emergency."</Q> On Foote's repeating &s;uch a whim&s;ical jargon Garrick would act a laugh like Bayes, though all the joke lay like Mr. Bayes's&mdash;in the boots.</P>
<P>Many whim&s;ical meetings have I been at be|tween tho&s;e two great geniu&s;&s;es, and truly enjoyed them from that time to the pre&s;ent. But Mr. Foote's knowledge of Garrick was but &s;uperficial when compared with Mr. Murphy's; for Mr. Murphy's cool and &s;en&s;ible penetration made him a perfect judge of the whole inward &s;oul of Mr. Garrick, while Foote, without perplexing him|&s;elf with the fatigue of thinking, was contented with &s;lighter materials to garni&s;h his merriment, and which amply &s;atisfied his love of &s;atire and cheerfulne&s;s. To &s;peak &s;eriou&s;ly of the&s;e gentle|men&mdash;why Foote &s;hould have entertained &s;uch
<PB N="23" REF="23">
an inconceivable di&s;gu&s;t to Mr. Garrick I cannot devi&s;e, unle&s;s from that implacable attendant, more or le&s;s in the human brea&s;t, called <HI>envy,</HI> which ever haunts a theatre. That Garrick had much rea&s;on to be offended with Foote is certain, and that he inwardly hated him is as certain; nor is that to be a matter of &s;urpri&s;e, as Foote was ever endeavouring to expo&s;e, and even, if po&s;&s;ible, to injure him: He gloried in it, and &s;eized every opportunity to have a cut at him and &s;erve him up as the maimed, not perfect Garrick&mdash;unle&s;s to acknowledge perforce, like Colley Cibber, who allowed (but with great difficulty) to Mrs. Bracegirdle, that really Garrick, he be|lieved, had merit, but Foote never introduced his de&s;erts, or heard of him as an actor with plea&s;ure, or allowed him any credit for his theatrical abili|ties, but wi&s;hed the conver&s;ation was over; or, if obliged to give his &s;entiments, would conclude with, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, the hound had a &s;omething clever; but if his excellence was to be examined, he would not be found in <HI>any part</HI> equal to Colley Cibber's Sir John Brute, Lord Foppington, Sir Courtly Nice, or Ju&s;tice Shallow."</Q><Q><L>And &s;o the world goes round.</L></Q></P>

Foote with &s;ums of money, not trifling, and Foote always attributed the favour done from fear, not genero&s;ity; yet it certainly was an obli|gation, and that &s;ervice tendered when Foote has been in awkward &s;ituations for want of ca&s;h, and to relate facts on all &s;ides I am here an&s;werable.<Q><L>&mdash;Nothing extenuate or &s;et down aught in malice.</L></Q></P>
<P>The following anecdote of Dr. John&s;on and Garrick Ro&s;cius may be relied on.</P>
<P>Doctor John&s;on, being with Foote, Holland, Woodward, and others, on a party at Mr. Gar|rick's villa at Hampton, as they were conver&s;ing on different &s;ubjects, he fell into a reverie, from which his attention was drawn by the accidentally ca&s;ting his eyes on a book-ca&s;e, to which he was as naturally attracted as the needle to the pole: on peru&s;ing the title pages of the be&s;t bound, he muttered inwardly with ineffable contempt, but proceeded on his exploring bu&s;ine&s;s of ob&s;erva|tion, ran his finger down the middle of each page, and then da&s;hed the volume di&s;dainfully open on the floor, the which Garrick beheld with much wonder and vexation, while the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence and attention was be&s;towed on the learned Doctor; but when he &s;aw his twentieth well-bound book thus manife&s;tly di&s;graced on the ground, and expecting his whole valuable collec|tion would &s;hare the &s;ame victim fate, he could
<PB N="25" REF="25">
no longer re&s;train him&s;elf, but &s;uddenly cried out mo&s;t vociferou&s;ly,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why d&mdash;n it, John&s;on,&mdash;you, you, you will de&s;troy all my books!"</Q>&mdash;At this John&s;on rai&s;ed his head, pau&s;ed, fixed his eyes, and replied, <Q REND="inline">"Lookee, David, you do un|der&s;tand plays, <HI>but you know nothing about books!</HI>"</Q> which repartee occa&s;ioned an irre&s;i&s;tible laugh at Garrick's expence, as well as that of his having given them a good dinner, with plenty of choice viands.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e are to be my memoirs, it is nece&s;|&s;ary to rehear&s;e over the &s;cenes of my &s;econd night's performance.&mdash;The hou&s;e was what we of the theatrical tribe like to &s;ee, and term <HI>chuck full in every part,</HI>&mdash;not only from the alarm the fir&s;t exhibition had given, but by many who were inimical to my performance, as well as tho&s;e who approved of it; for &s;everal actors had naturally rouzed their friends to cru&s;h me in the &s;hell if po&s;&s;ible, and not only &s;cotch the &s;nake but kill it.&mdash;On my fir&s;t entrance there were marks of di&s;approbation, and on my &s;econd &s;ounded to me at &s;uch an alarming height, that I thought all was over; but the multitude of well wi&s;hers, and the number who&s;e curio&s;ity had been rai&s;ed, longed to be &s;atisfied, and bore all before them; and very trifling marks were heard or &s;uf|fered after, &s;ufficient to create any great tremor or unea&s;ine&s;s:&mdash;to be conci&s;e; the oppo&s;ition proved

<P>This little piece went on in a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tate till about the fifth or &s;ixth night, when Mr. Sparks of Covent Garden theatre felt him&s;elf &s;o wounded by my attack on his acting, (which truly was a very picture&s;que one, and tho&s;e who re|member him and me at that time will allow what I have here &s;aid) that he waited on Mr. Garrick, and reque&s;ted he would not &s;uffer him, as a man of credit in private life, and an actor of e&s;tima|tion in public, to be de&s;troyed by &s;uch an illiberal attack on his livelihood; and, as it &s;truck at his reputation, hoped he would not permit it in fu|ture as far as regarded him&s;elf, whom it had rendered mi&s;erable.&mdash;Garrick &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why now

Pre&s;ently entered Foote, loudly &s;inging a French &s;ong to &s;hew his breed|ing, and on &s;eeing &s;uch a group of actors on the &s;tage, pronounced like Witwou'd, <Q REND="inline">"Hey day! what are you all got together here like players at the end of the la&s;t act!"</Q>&mdash;then &s;aid he had called at Mr. Garrick's hou&s;e, and was informed he &s;hould find him at the theatre; for he wanted to fix on
<PB N="31" REF="31">
two or three plays wherein he would act on the nights of his Diver&s;ions in the Morning. Mr. Garrick then a&s;&s;umed much &s;erious con&s;equence, and related to Mr. Foote the &s;tate of affairs&mdash;that he had received &s;trong repre&s;entations from Co|vent Garden theatre, and had, from motives of humanity and con&s;ideration, re&s;olved to put a &s;top to Wilkin&s;on's proceedings, and that Mr. Tate mu&s;t that night perform the part of Bounce only, and at his peril to di&s;obey his orders; and that after his exit as Mr. Bounce, the piece mu&s;t fini&s;h with Mr. Foote's performance, and no more Wilkin&s;on.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If indeed now&mdash;if Wilkin&s;on could have taken me off, as Mrs. Garrick &s;ays, why now as to that I &s;hould have liked it va&s;tly, and &s;o would Mrs. Garrick.&mdash;But I again en|force Wilkin&s;on's not appearing on my &s;tage a &s;econd time"</Q>&mdash;and to my a&s;toni&s;hment Foote a&s;&s;ented: But had I been intru&s;ted or ac|quainted with chicanery and the my&s;teries behind the curtain of a London theatre, (though to this hour I am not above half perfect) my wonder would not have been &s;o great.</P>
<P>I went from the playhou&s;e in dudgeon, and re|tired home with a heavy mind, though only three hours before I had left my lodgings all elate, and with a heart as light as a feather; but all my alertne&s;s was gone, and I entered with a bo&s;om

overpowered with &s;hame and di&s;appointment, and &s;hould not have been &s;urpri&s;ed had I been af|fronted in the &s;treets as I went to and from the theatre; for I every day received incendiary letters, and the rage and anger of &s;ome particular per|formers even bordered on inveteracy.</P>
<P>As the evening approached, I went and pre|pared my&s;elf for Bounce only, according to or|der, and when Bounce was fini&s;hed retired to the green-room; but am certain both Mr. Gar|rick and Mr. Foote had planted per&s;ons in the hou&s;e to call for Wilkin&s;on, becau&s;e Mr. Foote had not gone through half his performance when the call for me was univer&s;al; which could not have been the ca&s;e, as it was a repeated piece, and the time not come for my &s;econd appearance as u&s;ual, had not &s;ome &s;ubtlety been u&s;ed in the bu&s;ine&s;s. As for my own part, I am clear I was perfectly innocent, not having any knowledge of the town, or by any means, at that time, knowing how to rai&s;e a clamour of the kind; therefore &s;ome chicanery mu&s;t have been practi&s;ed in the affair. I thought Mr. Foote had been prepared with &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for the omi&s;&s;ion, and that he would have explained them to the audience, and the farce be no more repeated. But no doubt now remains with me, that, notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="33" REF="33">
lecture I had received in the morning, it meant more than reached the ear; and the event which followed was the re&s;ult of ingenuity, which by a develop of characters, I think I may hone&s;tly ven|ture to give a bold gue&s;s how the matter really was, though at that time it did not &s;trike my mind.&mdash;The clamour continued when Mr. Foote retired from the &s;tage, and Mr. Garrick ordered the lights to be let down, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix chandeliers hanging over the &s;tage, every one containing twelve candles in bra&s;s &s;ockets, and a heavy iron flouri&s;hed and joined to each bottom, large enough for a &s;treet pali&s;ade. This ceremony being complied with, Mr. Garrick &s;aid, it would, with the lamps al&s;o lowered, be a con|vincing proof to the audience that all was over; but this only &s;erved, like oil thrown on flames, to increa&s;e the vociferation. On Garrick's per|ceiving this, he came to me in the green-room, and with &s;eeming anger and terror a&s;ked me, How I had dared to cau&s;e a riot and di&s;turbance in his theatre, and &s;end a &s;et of blackguards into the hou&s;e to call for me? All I could urge in my horrid &s;ituation was, a&s;&s;erting my ignorance of the matter, but which was of no avail; and while I was proceeding with my a&s;&s;ervations in <HI>piano</HI>&mdash;the <HI>forte</HI> broke out into outrageous tu|mult&mdash;What was to be done!

<P>This declamation in&s;tead of pacifying, was trea|ted with marks of anger and contempt, and an univer&s;al cry for Wilkin&s;on!&mdash;Wilkin&s;on!&mdash;On which Mr. Foote advanced once more, and &s;aid, as for his own peculiarities, if they could afford the lea&s;t entertainment, Mr. Wilkin&s;on was at &s;ull liberty to exerci&s;e his talents to their utmo&s;t extent; and then added <HI>archly,</HI> (for the which I have rea&s;on to think, the manager did not find him&s;elf in the lea&s;t obliged) he believed, nay was a&s;&s;ured, Mr. Wilkin&s;on might as far as re&s;pected Mr. Garrick, without any re&s;trictions, take the

The curtain was dropped, and the branches al&s;o down on each &s;ide. My fright was apparent, but Mr. <HI>Town</HI> &s;oon cheered my &s;pirits, as there was not one di&s;&s;enting voice in the whole audience. I began, and very freely with Mr. Foote, and then was for retiring, but the cry was, <Q REND="inline">"No, no&mdash;go on, go on!"</Q> and many &s;aid aloud, <Q REND="inline">"Damn it, take them all off!"</Q> I took the hint, and was encouraged at &s;o furious a rate, that I went through a long cour&s;e of mimicry with great eclat, having permi&s;&s;ion, as I thought: My di&s;tre&s;s of the morning all vani&s;hed, and was exchanged for the mo&s;t delightful feelin s in the evening; being all elated, and on a &s;hort re|flection, relying on Garrick's declaration, as the words of truth, when he had twice declared no|thing could plea&s;e him or Mrs. Garrick more than a well executed likene&s;s of him&s;elf as an actor: but note, good reader, in this point I had not acted with honour, but duplicity; for when|ever he had jokingly a&s;k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> me <Q REND="inline">"What &s;ort of a

long plaudits for pronouncing a few words; but tho&s;e words were in Garrick's manner and re|quired time: they were from Biron, a part he had only fir&s;t performed the year before, the play being revived and altered to &s;hew Mrs. Cibber to advantage; and has of late &s;ea&s;ons proved equally, &s;o to Mrs. Siddons.<Q><SP>

<P>And at the la&s;t line I made my fini&s;h and exit in his manner, with loud acclamations, and was

all alive, alive O! But for me per&s;onally to reciter the&s;e peculiarities, would give a much better idea, than even the able&s;t pen can po&s;&s;ibly de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>After this night all oppo&s;ition or affront was dropped, and the enraged performers were advi&s;ed to let me die a natural death, as the mo&s;t prudent method; for, by oppo&s;ite means, they rendered Wilkin&s;on popular, and by not taking umbrage he would &s;ink into in&s;ignificance. The farce was continued and gained additional force; and Mr. Foote, as he reaped the profit, was highly enraptured, and &s;aid, Wilkin&s;on was very clever. He was the general, receiving high and honorary rewards, whil&s;t, in fact, I was merely held in rank but as a poor &s;ubaltern at low pay, for &s;tand|ing to be &s;hot at. In that farce Mr. Packer acted Carmine, and from that year 1758, has re|mained in a re&s;pectable light to the pre&s;ent date.</P>
<P>Certainly the &s;pace filled up while Garrick was in want of materials, both as to performers and plays, by this farce, was a &s;evere infliction on me; as the only advantage I derived from it, was mak|ing my&s;elf in &s;ome degree popular, and univer&s;ally known to be the &s;on of the late Rev. Dr. Wil|kin&s;on, who was obliged to &s;eek refuge and relief from the public by going on the &s;tage: But I really was in &s;imilitude no better than a &s;tone eater, or like Powell the fire-eater; for, I was com|pelled
<PB N="41" REF="41">
and obliged to &s;ubmit for receiving thirty &s;hillings per week, playhou&s;e-pay, to &s;tep each evening, comparatively &s;peaking, over red hot irons; but &s;urely it was my <HI>purity</HI> that guided my frequent walks with &s;uch &s;afety. All the time not <HI>one</HI> guinea as a pre&s;ent, or as a bribe, from either Mr. Garrick or Mr. Foote; nay, from that whim&s;ical night Mr. Garrick was &s;o hurt and offended with my repre&s;entation of his likene&s;s, that almo&s;t during the remainder of the &s;ea&s;on, he never deigned to let his eye grace me with its ob&s;ervance, and of cour&s;e not a &s;ingle word to comfort me from his royal lips; all con|veyed whenever I met him au&s;terity, anger, and di&s;like. Indeed, he felt him&s;elf inwardly hurt with the liberty I had taken; yet, &s;urely, he had drawn him&s;elf into the predicament, by what was very extraordinary to &s;ay and alledge of him as fact,
<Q>HIS OWN BAD ACTING.</Q> For he certainly was beyond compare, the mo&s;t univer&s;al great actor the world ever produced on a &s;tage, or probably ever will. I, like a fool as I was, becau&s;e I looked upon Mr. Garrick as a great performer, put confidence in what he &s;aid, and thought it was go&s;pel; but it needs no wonder|ful &s;en&s;e, and but very little experience, to teach how wrong, laughable, and ab&s;urd, it is to believe
<PB N="42" REF="42">
<HI>all</HI> that great men will &s;ay: Not but there are phoe|nomena of noblene&s;s and goodne&s;s who are contra|dictions to &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion, as I can te&s;tify, have experienced, and may again; I tru&s;t I &s;hall know ble&s;&s;ings and benevolence from the great and be|nevolent. The world in general, like a wild gar|den, may be over-run with weeds, brambles, and brairs, neverthele&s;s here and there a fine nectarine or peach may be plucked; or like a lottery abound|ing with blanks, yet a&s;toni&s;hing luck may &s;ur|pri&s;e the unfortunate with a prize.</P>
<P>After having been at that time near twelve months in regular practice on the &s;tage, it does not at this period read to my advantage, to have proved my&s;elf &s;uch an egregious dupe; and to have been &s;o mere a novice to arts of great|ne&s;s, and the ob&s;ervance of the wide difference between what is pronounced by the lips and thought by the mind.</P>
<P>Foote, by the practice of &s;eeing me take him off every night, as I kept within the bounds of decorum, let it not a whit di&s;turb his repo&s;e; for, as he obtained the golden fleece&mdash;why, let the world laugh and be&mdash;. And &s;o far it be|came hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s and intere&s;t, while that farce la&s;ted; but as to his good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">riend&s;hip for me tho' very plea&s;ant at the time, it only extended to&mdash;<HI>No longer pipe&mdash;no longer dance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="43">
Mr. Garrick, who felt aggrieved from what he had him&s;elf de&s;ired me to do, and what I had acted by his reque&s;t and permi&s;&s;ion, blamed <HI>me</HI> (as is natural in mo&s;t ca&s;es) rather than <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> and not being my friend, it &s;erved to increa&s;e his &s;pleen and di&s;like. Another rea&s;on made him ex|pre&s;s his tenderne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition and &s;oft &s;en&s;a|tions of his heart, by way of condemning my performance; and by that open di&s;avowal waved all blame or &s;everity from being levelled at him: as on that occa&s;ion, he not only publicly di&s;ap|proved, but declared his innocence as to any knowledge of what I had done. For, &s;o far from his &s;u&s;pecting or being aware of it, I had &s;ur|pri&s;ed him by a &s;tolen march, &s;o his hands were clear; and as to Mr. Foote, if any dirt was thrown at him, he could wa&s;h it off with his Tea, and clean him&s;elf. But above all he feared, if he &s;eemingly approved and all was quiet and I found my&s;elf of con&s;equence, by evidently draw|ing money to his royal exchequer, I might not without rea&s;on, touch him on his tendere&s;t point, the very ma&s;ter &s;tring that made mo&s;t harmony or di&s;cord in him&mdash;that was <HI>money</HI>&mdash;his <HI>money!</HI> his <HI>money!</HI> his <HI>money!</HI></P>
<P>If I from &s;uch a poor pittance proved my&s;elf a pecuniary object to Mr. Garrick, had he &s;anc|tioned and applauded what he had thus di&s;ap|proved,
<PB N="44" REF="44">
and had I petitioned and offered to re|mon&s;trate for an addition to my &s;alary, or &s;olicited for a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent for &s;ecret &s;ervices, he could not with any degree of propriety have re|fu&s;ed; therefore he wi&s;ely and politically guarded again&s;t &s;uch an attack, and thereby effectually prevented an impertinent reque&s;t at that time from me, or any friend I might depute to hint or pre|&s;ent a memorial with &s;tated rea&s;ons for my ad|vancement in his army; as I had under General Bayes's command, in three or four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive en|gagements, di&s;tingui&s;hed my&s;elf in the field of battle, where I had fought with great bravery when &s;erving in his regiment of light hor&s;e, and was twice or thrice di&s;covered among&s;t the &s;lain. This or any &s;uch manife&s;to would have proved fruitle&s;s and abortive; for be&s;ides taking away his life, his &s;oul, his dear old gold, as he had yielded or (in well acted appearance) &s;eemed to have yielded to the &s;tings of his tender con&s;cience, by which it was conceived, and even actually be|lieved, in oppo&s;ition and again&s;t their &s;en&s;es, that his goodne&s;s was &s;uperior to his &s;elf-intere&s;t; this afforded him two &s;ecret plea&s;ures&mdash;rai&s;ing his humanity at my expence, and after all contriving to have it called for and continued as if again&s;t his inclination. This was a <HI>ma&s;ter piece</HI> of a head finely interwoven with wheels within wheels, and
<PB N="45" REF="45">
far &s;uperior to any mechani&s;m his carpenters could boa&s;t of&mdash;and of their &s;kill he had thus declaimed&mdash;<Q><L>" What eager tran&s;port &s;tares from ev'ry eye,</L>

<L>" Half her NEW RIVER roll'd to Drury-Lane."</L></Q> And a third rea&s;on was, though la&s;t, not of the lea&s;t plea&s;ing re&s;ult; as by this train of my alledged offences I was &s;ecluded and kept at a proper di|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ance, &s;o as to prevent any approach to the throne; therefore my harve&s;t did not promi&s;e to be a gol|den one, being forbid my appearance at court. This farce continued going on with quietne&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s till near Chri&s;tmas. During that time I was in a perpetual round of engagements and in|vitations, either with my own friends, or on par|ties with Mr. Foote at many of the fa&s;hion|able tables, &s;uch as Mr. Calcraft's, Lady Vane's, Sir Francis Delaval's; and mixed with the fir&s;t &s;et of gentlemen at the principal hotels and taverns in London. One day I was led into an error from vanity, but certainly not to my credit; however, as a faithful hi&s;torian I will not hide the circum|&s;tance.</P>
<P>As the gla&s;s and good humour went round, and each &s;eemed on a level, I from intimacy, and
<PB N="46" REF="46">
and really a liking to all my friend Shuter did, u&s;ed frequently for half an hour together to intro|duce my&s;elf into company as Mr. Shuter, and being with him perpetually on his &s;ober as well as his indi&s;creet frolics, it actually only &s;eemed to tho&s;e acquainted with his mode and manner as another Shuter, as his &s;tage-acting or his private oddities were become equally ea&s;y to be a&s;&s;umed by me. This cau&s;ed &s;o much laugh, applau&s;e, and flattery, which is much more fa&s;cinating than a jack-a-lanthorn, and ea&s;ily gains followers; that I was per|&s;uaded to exhibit a likene&s;s of Shuter on the &s;tage. Foote de&s;ired Colonel Thornton, and &s;everal o|thers to importune me, urging what was really true, that as a genius of comedy he could not re|ceive any injury by the force of imitation; that as a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of humour he would even him&s;elf be en|ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">d with it, and it was impo&s;&s;ible for him, on &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> a trivial occa&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n, to be &s;eriou&s;ly angry, as he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d more &s;en&s;e, &amp;c. All the&s;e arguments working on my eagerne&s;s for fame, &s;educed me, but not without &s;ome pangs, as I really and truly, in the full &s;en&s;e of the word, re|garded Shuter, and admired his faults full equally with his be&s;t qualities; for we had heard the chimes at midnight. Not any per&s;on now exi&s;ting re|members this circum&s;tance &s;o well as Mr. Au&s;tin; he and I were very intimate, and he was one of
<PB N="47" REF="47">
the very few belonging to the theatre who wi&s;hed me well; and when I informed him of Colonel Thornton and Foote's reque&s;t, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why, Tate, you are a great rogue, but you may as well take off Shuter as not, it will only be a &s;hyne&s;s for a few days, and then you will &s;hake hands and all will be well again;"</Q> and that evening with my waggi&s;h friend's advice, who loved a little mi&s;|chief, and which accorded with my own inclina|tion, it was concluded, and the next night carried into execution.&mdash;I want, now (though all is over, and I am truly grieved to &s;ay Shuter is dead and buried) to lay the blame on the per&s;ua&s;ive Jo&s;eph and the odd bottle that made us both much wi&s;er than when we yawned over the fir&s;t. It awkward|ly happened the next day after this con&s;ultation, that I met Shuter at dinner, and knowing my evil intentions, I felt like mo&s;t people who are con|&s;cious integrity is not the &s;trict rule of their con|du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t, for though not a criminal or a &s;erious mat|ter, it certainly wanted a palliation, but I did not know how to act.&mdash;Shuter had &s;tuck by me from m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> very fir&s;t di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;Shuter had &s;tood buff for me again&s;t a ho&s;t of foes&mdash;and I knew not any able lawyer who could undertake my brief, and that brief weighed with &s;uch rea&s;ons, who could &s;t ictly acquit me even to my&s;elf. If I had a&s;ked him &s;eriou&s;ly, he certainly would have given
<PB N="48" REF="48">
a negative, and &s;till let &s;u&s;picion of his friend hanker on his mind in future, and on his refu&s;al I could not think of doing it; therefore I determined like a young couple for Scotland, who marry fir&s;t, and a&s;k pardon afterwards. I cannot defend this con|duct to Shuter to this moment, though I can boa&s;t, if that can be taken as an excu&s;e, that I re|ceived great encouragement for the &s;ame; but it deadened all Shuter's intimacy and mine. Yet like Parthenope you will find (with a little pa|tience) it was not dead neither. I entered on the comic-tragical bu&s;ine&s;s I had promi&s;ed on the very evening I had purpo&s;ed. The amazingly &s;trong likene&s;s of &s;o popular a &s;tage character when I appeared in walk, gait, voice, and features, in M'Ruthen, the London cries, &amp;c. was by the galleries in&s;tantaneou&s;ly recognized for their dar|ling friend Ned Shuter; and in&s;tead of anger they received it with &s;uch joy, that when it was over I flattered my&s;elf Shuter would be as plea&s;ed as my|&s;elf; but in&s;tead of that&mdash;No, no, it was quite the contrary. <HI>I</HI> called it a joke, <HI>Shuter</HI> did not; or if he would, tho&s;e about him were &s;o little prone to good-nature, that they would not &s;uffer any ve|getation of that kind to grow or re&s;t in his mind, but plucked it up by the roots. Applau&s;e I re|ceived it is very true, but by all Shuter's friends and acquaintance, which were very numerous, I
<PB N="49" REF="49">
was &s;hunned and looked upon as treacherous. I think I had &s;ome perpetual fatality in tho&s;e (as well as the pre&s;ent) days, which quickly clouded my &s;un&s;hine by heavy &s;howers of perplexity.</P>
<P>This trifling imitation of mine (though very like) was truly non&s;en&s;ical, and by no means inju|rious; yet it was &s;o blazoned by <HI>all</HI> the performers of both hou&s;es, that I was repre&s;ented in the blacke&s;t colours, as incapable of friend&s;hip, &s;en&s;i|bility, or gratitude. This gave me many a twinge, but the want of his company at that time was a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vere puni&s;hment indeed, as not being with him two or three evenings if practicable in the week required, in my young opinion, engagements of a &s;uperior kind to make amends for &s;o great a lo&s;s as the &s;ociety of my friend Edward Shuter; my only compen&s;ation was the applau&s;e I received on my continued imitation, which I thought a very good joke. To keep up my &s;pirits, added to my kind reception at the theatre, all my own particular friends in private life were &s;taunch and good, and I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the be&s;t of mothers perfectly happy, and every rea&s;onable want at com|mand. Many of my mother's and late father's acquaintance were, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, in the vale of years, and not of the fri&s;ky ca&s;t. At that time I frequently dined at the Thatched Hou&s;e, in Pall-Mall, with Colonel Thornton of the Blues; and
<PB N="50" REF="50">
being &s;o well received at Drury-Lane theatre &s;e|cured tho&s;e favours&mdash;for all in all depends upon &s;ucce&s;s, and every day &s;tamps that remark;&mdash;al&s;o with young Captain St. Leger (the late General St. Leger) of whom I have &s;poken before.</P>
<P>About the early time of my acquaintance with General St. Leger, Mr. Flood, Colonel Boden, Captain Hu&s;&s;ey, and many others, were frequently on &s;nug chit chat parties; &s;ometimes for dinners, at other times after the play. And indeed the&s;e agreeable and reputable engagements made me great amends for the almo&s;t total neglect of &s;ceni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> acquaintance, Mr. Au&s;tin being then my &s;ingle in|timate theatrical flower, and the only one I could &s;elect out of the whole collected bunch of both the royal playhou&s;e no&s;egays, and with him that intimacy has continued.</P>
<P>At that time (during the run of Foote's farce) I actually had received genteel pre&s;ents not to be too free as an imitator. Mr. Ridout, before my unlucky mi&s;under&s;tanding with Shuter, had very frequently de&s;ired the favour of both our compa|nies to &s;up with him at the Shak&s;peare, at which meeting he informed me that he was unhappy at the apprehen&s;ion of my marking his manner of playing before the London audience, as he was well informed I had the capability of putting &s;uch an act into force, for our mutual friend Shuter had
<PB N="51" REF="51">
in his laughing manner told him the &s;ame, but it had more forcibly alarmed him as Mr. Macklin had declared at the Bedford, that Mr. Wilkin&s;on had proved more genius in his manner of per&s;ona|ting <HI>that non-entity</HI> RIDOUT, than all his other forces collected; and not many years are elap&s;ed &s;ince I have, from Mr. Macklin him&s;elf, heard the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion repeated. Mr. Ridout continued to urge he was not an object of &s;ufficient con&s;e|quence to cau&s;e any addition to my reputation; therefore unle&s;s I could alledge a contradictory rea&s;on to that a&s;&s;ertion, he de&s;ired Shuter's intere&s;t might intervene and prevent my putting any &s;uch experiment into practice, and &s;aid, if he found I let him lie undi&s;turbed and &s;leep in quiet, he on his word of honour would not only think him&s;elf much indebted to me, but in the utmo&s;t punctilio prove to me that he was not only an obliged friend, but a grateful one. Shuter &s;olicited, and the bond of amity was &s;ettled to the &s;atisfaction of the trio; and I mu&s;t in ju&s;tice add, Mr. Ridout ever behaved to me like a gentleman, and when pa&s;t all worldly cares and &s;olicitude, proved him|&s;elf the man of his word and honour, as will here|after appear.</P>

The character was entitled and called Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y; all was ready rehear&s;ed and perfectly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">repared for our royal exhibition&mdash;when, O dreadful to relate! or, as Mrs. Inchbald's epilogue to Such Things Are expre&s;&s;es it, <Q REND="inline">"Down came an order to &s;u&s;pend the ball!"</Q>&mdash;In plain Engli&s;h, a peremptory mandate from the Lord Chamberlain to inform Mr. Garrick, that Mr. Aprice, a gentleman of family and fortune, had made per&s;onal application to him as highly ag|grieved, and had urged that, at the united voice of all his connections, he de&s;ired the farce of the Au|thor might be expunged from the li&s;t of theatrical pieces, they having all concurred in one general opin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">on that the character of Mr. Cadwallader was purpo&s;ely written and drawn out by the writer
<PB N="53" REF="53">
to render ridiculous Mr. Aprice, his manner, and his peculiar oddities, which made him a topic for public laughter, and &s;atirical joke and mummery&mdash;him&s;elf and wife could not go along the &s;treets without being in&s;ulted with, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Becky, and here comes Dicky, &amp;c."</Q>&mdash;which allegations were &s;trictly true: In &s;hort, he urged that they were become common objects for laughter and affront by Mr. Foote's audacious freedom; and though he hone&s;tly confe&s;&s;ed he had with his wife Dolly &s;een the farce, yet they could not find a &s;i|militude, but his family felt injured as well as all their friends, who in&s;i&s;ted on a curb being laid on Mr. Foote's licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and the only proper and immediate removal of grievance re&s;ted on the &s;en&s;e, feelings, ju&s;tice, and honour of the Lord Chamberlain for in&s;tant <HI>redre&s;s.</HI> His Lord&s;hip on very little con&s;ideration favoured the remon|&s;trance, and gave his verdict again&s;t Mr. Foote: being at the very cri&s;is, and not put in force till the day of performance, all appeal, all intere&s;t to counterbalance was in vain; he would hear no petitions; that day was the final will and plea&s;ure; and my poor Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y's apparel may in con&s;equence be mouldering for what I know on the &s;helves of the wardrobe at Drury-Lane, but I hope not for the honour of her family, as the wardrobe was in hands that knew how to turn the
<PB N="54" REF="54">
penny, and not let any thing be u&s;ele&s;s that by wi&s;e contrivance could be made to produce &s;ome|thing, and &s;ure to do &s;o if ever &s;o little. This &s;udden and fatal decree was irrevocable, and Mr. Foote, as the command came &s;o unexpectedly, even while I was actually rehear&s;ing the new &s;cene, was thrown into a con&s;ternation and panic not to be de&s;cribed. Tho&s;e who are inured to misfor|tunes bear &s;hocks of terror and di&s;appointment with more firmne&s;s of mind than tho&s;e whom affluence and favour have courted, as u&s;e reconciles hard|&s;hips; and indeed is comprehended by what every old man and woman can &s;ay, That one half of the world do not know how the other half live.</P>
<P>Mr. Foote appeared &s;hocked, pale, and dejected, for in the Author he had depended on honours flowing thick upon him, which this ha&s;ty killing fro&s;t not only nipped but cut the root, &s;o as to prevent its being for that year a tree bearing fruit; nay, even Mrs. Clive was melted, who hated him, and had &s;aid but an hour before, <Q REND="inline">"You play Shy|lock, Mr. Foote! how the devil &s;hould you know how to act Shylock, who never could play a cha|racter well in your life!" "Why not, madam?" replied Foote, "how can you tell I can't act Shy|lock till you have &s;een me?" "Why," replied Clive, (with a woman-like rea&s;on) becau&s;e I am certain you don't know how to &s;peak a line of
<PB N="55" REF="55">
it;"</Q> and all was by the angry lady as ea&s;ily pro|nounced as if it had been &s;aid to her cook-wench. By the bye, though &s;he was a comic actre&s;s <HI>beyond</HI> compare, when in her proper line, as Mrs. Heidle|burgh, Widow Blackacre, &amp;c. yet her Portia was as truly bad as her own imagination (however contemptible it might be) formed Mr. Foote's Shylock would be. But this tender Catherine (and there &s;he was clever) almo&s;t &s;obbed for her dear Foote when the Author was prohibited, and his Lord&s;hip, who &s;ent the decree, did not e&s;cape her deprecations: but the &s;ecret lay here; Becky, I mean Mrs. Cadwallader, her part in the farce, be|ing &s;topped, was as great a di&s;appointment to her as an actre&s;s, as the Author being &s;ilenced was to Mr. Foote. He felt like Shylock, which he had been rehear&s;ing, and regretted the money this &s;toppage would lo&s;e him, three thou&s;and ducats in that, be&s;ides other precious jewels. The incom|parable Clive outwardly grieved for Foote, and acted it very well, though tragedy was not her forte, but was inwardly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by her anger, and all her tenderne&s;s being really moved for the lo&s;s of her dear Mrs. Cadwallader; and certainly very few &s;uch in&s;tances of great acting ever was or will be produced in competition with her performance of that character. She there (as Cibber &s;ays in his preface) outdid her u&s;ual outdoings. She was

the terror of poets, managers, actors, actre&s;&s;es, and mu&s;icians&mdash;O rare Kate Clive!&mdash;there was no re&s;ource left but to change the farce, &s;tick up fre&s;h bills, explain the unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity for &s;o doing, and reque&s;t the u&s;ual indulgence&mdash;as to what farce&mdash;the &s;tale Diver&s;ions of the Morning was the only &s;ub&s;titute. The&s;e precau|tions taken, Mr. Foote went home to dinner as &s;heepi&s;h and with as little appetite as I had done &s;ome weeks before on my general lecture day, and I dare an&s;wer for him with as little reli&s;h; for tho&s;e who are ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uperabundant &s;pirits, when once they are &s;unk, are quite chop-fallen.</P>
<P>I retired with a mediocrity of temper on this occa&s;ion like an ea&s;y gentleman, though really &s;orry for Mr. Foote: I was al&s;o &s;orry for the lo&s;s of my Iri&s;h lady, whom I had ju&s;t taken into keeping; but as my wants were not pinched, this little fracas did not depre&s;s me. The audiences in London generally have great con&s;ideration, and though di&s;appointed and vexed at not &s;eeing this long promi&s;ed favourite farce of the Author, with the new &s;cene, were convinced that Mr. Foote &s;hould rather claim their pity and encou|ragement than their condemnation, as he lo&s;t not only by his hou&s;e being in &s;ome degree prejudi|ced that night, by the peremptory order of high office, but al&s;o his profits from the managers for
<PB N="57" REF="57">
eight or ten nights, which alluring pro&s;pects were rendered impracticable, great expectations being daily increa&s;ed by Mr. Foote's repeated puffs in the public papers, not omitting the humour and excellence to be expected from Wilkin&s;on's new character of Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y. The &s;ub&s;titution of the Diver&s;ions of the Morning was received rather like a new favourite than a repeated old piece, which is generally the ca&s;e in London when|ever the Chapter of Accidents cau&s;es di&s;appoint|ments, and every one is thoroughly convinced whatever has happened wrong is not in con&s;e|quence of neglect or de&s;ign. Nothing will &s;tronger po&s;&s;e&s;s minds in general, or warp them to ob&s;tinate ill-nature &s;o certainly as an idea of fal&s;ehood, art, or the being entrapped by the &s;ini&s;ter theatrical views behind the curtain.</P>
<P>Good fortune had whirled her wheel &s;o plea|&s;antly, take her for all in all, till Chri&s;tmas 1758, that my univer&s;al acquaintance made me quite an indifferent &s;pectator, and ideas of being a great man, which had &s;o often been cru&s;hed and lain dormant began to rear again, not without &s;trong hopes of honours accompanied, I a&s;&s;ured my&s;elf that halcyon days would &s;ome time come; nay, to place my hopes on infallible grounds, a gip&s;ey at Norwood, near Dulwich, fortold wonders; and every wonder, to &s;uit my prophetic fancy, &s;he

affirmed, and I, with a faith as &s;trong as a &s;en&s;ible methodi&s;t, believed all.</P>

Mi&s;s Macklin had only acted Jane Shore twice, and Lady Townly once. The fir&s;t night of Mi&s;s Macklin's Jane Shore, it was then a common ob|&s;ervation, and by a few remembered to this hour, that Mrs. Cibber was that night really in&s;pired with &s;omething more than mortal; &s;he felt the god, and though her Alicia had always been look|ed upon as one of her very be&s;t characters, yet that night's performance &s;he never equalled before or &s;ince. As the world is not over good natured, the cau&s;e was attributed to &s;ome offence at the rehear&s;al &s;he conceived Mr. Macklin to have gi|ven her; therefore &s;he determined, in revenge, to hurt Mi&s;s Macklin by her &s;uperiority, and ca&s;t all po&s;&s;ibility of competitor&s;hip at a di&s;tance. I do not relate this as a fact, only from Madam <HI>Hear-Say;</HI> but think there mu&s;t have been &s;omething extraordinary in Mrs. Cibber's acting that night to have occa&s;ioned &s;o many different reports.</P>
<P>Mr. Foote pre&s;ented Mr. Macklin with his &s;pick &s;pan new farce of the Engli&s;hman in Paris, for his benefit. The character of Lucinda, was drawn on purpo&s;e to introduce Mi&s;s Macklin to advantage, and prove to the town that Mr. Mack|lin had not &s;pared any expence to render the education and accompli&s;hments of his daughter worthy the notice of the public. Her dancing and mu&s;ic ma&s;ter were purpo&s;ely introduced, to
<PB N="61" REF="61">
prove her various excellencies. Mr. Macklin acted Buck.&mdash;In April it was buzzed, that Mr. Foote him&s;elf was to act Buck for Mi&s;s Mack|lin's benefit, which I believe he did on Tue&s;|day the 24th of April, with a <HI>new prologue.</HI> But Mr. Foote was not &s;een and adverti&s;ed as an actor, from the &s;pring 1748, till at Drury-Lane in October and November 1753, five years, when Garrick wrote the prologue&mdash;a part of which I have in&s;erted before, relative to a circum&s;tance already mentioned, and here give the remainder.&mdash;<Q><L>Among the matters that occa&s;ion prate,</L>

<P>I mu&s;t here note, that Mr. Foote's fir&s;t imita|tions of the actors was only on his fir&s;t appearing on the Hay-market &s;tage.&mdash;After that flouri&s;h he had a very genteel fortune left him in 1748, and his gaiety of di&s;po&s;ition and thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s was &s;uch as to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;tage was not worthy of at|tention, and he did not imagine it was ever more to be his de&s;tined lot; till that fortune by being expended obliged him, from craving nece&s;&s;ity, to bethink him&s;elf and return.</P>
<P>Mr. Foote was de&s;cended from a family of di&s;tinction in Devon&s;hire, a Sir John Goodeere; but as I have not knowledge of heraldry, and know not all the particulars, will only mention
<PB N="63" REF="63">
that was the name of the re&s;pectable family to whom he by right claimed relation&s;hip. He was introduced in every re&s;pect into the world with a fortune which his volatility &s;oon expended, and was univer&s;ally known and received as a gentle|man in every party, where he was e&s;pou&s;ed, ca|re&s;&s;ed, and connected: he &s;oon proved him&s;elf a &s;pendthrift, and was truly in character as <Q REND="inline">"The Engli&s;hman returned from Paris."</Q></P>
<P>In this year, September 1753, Mi&s;s Macklin was regularly engaged as an actre&s;s at Drury-Lane, and Mr. Macklin took his farewell of the public in the following epilogue, (as a veteran actor, thirty-&s;even years &s;ince) Dec. 1753.<Q>Mr. MACKLIN'S FAREWELL EPILOGUE.

<P>Mr. Macklin performed that very night in the Refu&s;al, or the Ladies Philo&s;ophy, Sir Gilbert Wrangle; Lady Wrangle, Mrs. Macklin; and Charlotte, Mi&s;s Macklin: The entertainment was the Engli&s;hman in Paris.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="65">
In a few years he returned to the &s;tage, his ta|vern and coffee-room having embarra&s;&s;ed, not made his fortune. And this very Mr. Macklin, in February 1789, performed at Covent Garden theatre, Shylock and Sir Archy M'Sarca&s;m, on one and the &s;ame night, aged ninety; al&s;o in the &s;ame year, Sir Pertinax M'Sycophant, in the Man of the World; which part is not le&s;s, according to our theatrical lingo, than thirty-&s;ix lengths&mdash;each length &s;hould be forty-four lines, including the cues. I am more induced to introduce this re|markable circum&s;tance here, as it is in &s;ome de|gree affinitive to my narration relative to Mr. Foote and my&s;elf, and marks in time and place Mr. Macklin as the wonder of our theatrical he|mi&s;phere, whom we now find again on the boards, thirty-&s;even years after he had taken his farewell of the &s;tage.</P>
<P>That excellent performer, and undoubted good &s;tage preceptor of unbounded credit, for the ho|nour and reputation of the fraternity, has &s;hewn and proved in a full court of ju&s;tice, and a&s;&s;erted the proper rights and privileges of an actor, as an Engli&s;hman, and has not only relieved the op|pre&s;&s;ed performer's mind, when overpowered by inju&s;tice and calumny, but made him&s;elf ri&s;e, not only in a di&s;tingui&s;hed light as an a&s;&s;erter of na|tural liberty, but elevated him in a much &s;uperior
<PB N="66" REF="66">
degree when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of retribution for wrongs and a&s;&s;ociated villainy combined again&s;t him; and proved to mankind, that he never forgot his ma|&s;ter Shak&s;peare, who &s;ays,
<Q><L>That man &s;hews like&s;t God,</L>
<L>When mercy &s;ea&s;ons ju&s;tice.</L></Q>
For though his damages granted were great, and would have nearly ruined his oppre&s;&s;ors, yet he was content with victory, and, like a true con|queror, e&s;tabli&s;hed his rights by an act of clemency, and freely forgave all claim to the &s;poils he had been allowed.</P>
<P>Lea&s;t it &s;hould not be known to what I allude, I refer to Mr. Macklin's trial of a combined riot to prevent his ever playing again. Mr. Macklin pleaded as his own coun&s;el, and Lord Mansfield declared on the bench, that Mr. Macklin, though an excellent player, had never acted his part &s;o well as on that day:&mdash;Therefore let every per|former reverence him and his name; and may he ever be in their flowing cups remembered, and not forget at the &s;ame time, that this honour to the profe&s;&s;ion took his leave of the public as men|tioned, but returned in a few years, wrote Love A-la-Mode, Man of the World, &amp;c. pieces of &s;terling worth, and was this year, 1789, acting in play and farce.&mdash;Sure he has laboured hard in the
<PB N="67" REF="67">
vineyard, and pray God he may de&s;cend peace|fully and happily to his grave. If any players are ble&s;&s;ed with being holy &s;pirits, &s;ure they will all hail his relief from this temporary abode of toil and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Mr. Foote's benefit, though he was di&s;appoint|ed of his farce of the Author, was, it is true, very beneficial; but his career was &s;topped, and our Diver&s;ions of the Morning, though it had afforded good dinners, &s;uppers, &amp;c. for &s;everal weeks, would not any longer produce even tea for breakfa&s;t, particularly on a &s;haring plan; as like mo&s;t things in this world, it had had its day; and Foote could only <HI>reflect</HI> on his own lines in that very farce, where Crambo repeats,<Q><L>&mdash;O what a Lord Mayor's fea&s;t of joy art thou!</L>
<L>Thy face is veni&s;on, and thy neck white veal;</L>
<L>And all thy other parts are beef and pudding.&mdash;</L></Q> For &s;ays Foote, (as Mr. Puzzle) a poet &s;hould always make compari&s;ons on tho&s;e things he likes be&s;t. So Mr. Foote, the poet, had, by the ap|proach of January, with perfect ea&s;e &s;quandered away all the profits which aro&s;e from our diver|&s;ions, and as ea&s;ily the ma&s;&s;y &s;um of his benefit night; &s;o all the extravagant rarities which he had enjoyed in November and December, were, in a comparative view, to be devoured by a real good
<PB N="68" REF="68">
&s;tomach, by imagination, with fancied delicacies, like his own poet Mr. Crambo; and Mr. Foote therefore in earne&s;t felt the January bla&s;ts, which cut him through and through.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle joint of mutton was his fare, of which I often partook, and he generally had one or two to dine with him; but humble port and Li&s;bon were the only wines at dinner&mdash;no claret or Madeira, for the credit had wained with the pocket&mdash;He never could work till his genius was put to its wits end. Poets are generally mentioned as poor, and too frequently are &s;o; but I gue&s;s they have one par|ticular advantage, which other people when the &s;hoe pinches do not enjoy; for like the bear, that when in want of food finds &s;u&s;tenance from &s;uck|ing his paws,&mdash;&s;o the poet, when in want of luxu|ries, feeds on his own thoughts, which luckily are never &s;o bright or come to his aid with equal &s;wiftne&s;s of thought and fiery flights of fancy as when de&s;titute of the good things of this world; he then needs not Mr. Bayes's recipe of &s;tewed prunes, or to phy&s;ic and let blood to purge the belly. I mu&s;t allow my&s;elf at that time much obliged to his good breeding, as he ever &s;eemed glad to &s;ee me at his table, and &s;eemed to &s;tudy to make that table agreeable; and indeed he never &s;hewed him&s;elf to more advantage than when ma|king his gue&s;ts welcome, as he &s;eemed the gene|rous,

ho&s;pitable, cheerful, and &s;incere friend of every per&s;on who partook of his fare, which was always of the be&s;t, whenever the be&s;t could with convenience be procured.</P>
<P>He was &s;oon after his benefit in &s;uch a &s;tate of poverty, that all parties at the Thatched Hou&s;e, Bedford Arms, &amp;c. were obliged to be given up. He appeared vexed whenever I was indi&s;pen&s;ably engaged, unle&s;s indeed he could get much better company, &s;uch as Mr. Murphy or Mr. Macklin, but they were not always to be had, nor were they ever hand and glove; for whenever Macklin and he had a tiff, though I believe Mr. Foote might be the aggre&s;&s;or, yet Mr. Macklin on &s;uch broile|ries would treat him, not only very cavalierly, but very roughly.</P>
<P>At the time my company was &s;o welcome, many happy laughing evenings have I had in James-&s;treet with him&s;elf, Me&s;&s;rs. Murphy, and Macklin; often as the circling gla&s;s went round and warmed my vain heart, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Macklin would communicate their intentions of proceeding on a play or farce, or &s;ome lucky thought; Foote got all the information he could, and, like Mr. Bayes, pop! he clapped it down and made it his own.</P>
<P>Mr. Murphy had particularly tried how far Mr. Foote was worthy to be tru&s;ted; for in 1753,
<PB N="70" REF="70">
when Mr. Foote's Engli&s;hman in Paris was acted, he approved of it &s;o much, that like Sir John Van|brugh, who reli&s;hed Cibber's Love's La&s;t Shift, and his good acting of Sir Novelty Fa&s;hion, in complement to Cibber's merit, both as author and actor, he wrote the Relap&s;e, or Virtue in Danger, as a &s;equel to Love's La&s;t Shift, and created Sir Novelty Fa&s;hion a peer of the realm, under the title of Lord Foppington:&mdash;So Mr. Murphy, plea&s;ed with the Engli&s;hman in Paris, paid the &s;ame compliment to his intimate friend Mr. Foote, and &s;et about writing a &s;equel to his piece.</P>
<P>Mr. Murphy made his fir&s;t appearance as an actor at Covent Garden theatre on Friday the 18th of October, 1754, in the character of Othello&mdash;went over to Drury-Lane in September 1755, and on Saturday, September 20, played O&s;myn in the Mourning Bride&mdash;produced his new farce of the Apprentice on Friday, January 2, 1756. He had in the &s;ummer of 1755 fini&s;hed his farce called, The Engli&s;hman returned from Paris, be|ing a &s;equel to Mr. Foote's Engli&s;hman in Paris; of which he having informed Mr. Foote, it cau&s;ed his genius immediately to &s;et to work and fini&s;h a farce in two acts on the &s;ame plan, and with which he &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed Mr. Murphy, (while his farce of the Apprentice was acting with much good fortune at its heels at Drury-Lane) by hav|ing
<PB N="71" REF="71">
a new farce in two acts, called The Engli&s;h|man returned from Paris, in rehear&s;al at Covent-Garden, and he had it acted for the fir&s;t time on Tue&s;day, February 3, 1756. Mr. Murphy was much chagrined and ju&s;tly offended with Mr. Foote's duplicity on this occa&s;ion. The reception Mr. Foote's piece obtained at Covent Garden was &s;uch as to preclude Mr. Murphy from all thoughts of gain by an offer of his farce at Drury-Lane, not only by its &s;ucce&s;s at the oppo&s;ite theatre, but by Mr. Foote's being a thorough judge of the &s;ubject from his frequent trips to Paris; Mr. Murphy therefore contented him&s;elf with bringing out his Engli&s;hman returned from Paris at his benefit, with an occa&s;ional prologue, on Saturday, April the 3d, which Mr. Murphy &s;poke him&s;elf, and in &s;ome humorous lines was very &s;evere on his friend Sa|muel; but Sam had got the money, and it di|&s;turbed him not. In the farce, as well as I can recollect from &s;o long a date, and my &s;eeing it once, (the only time it was ever acted) I remem|ber &s;ome doubt was made as to the identity of Sir Charles Buck from Paris, as he had been announ|ced to the public, and introduced for a con&s;ider|able time. <Q REND="inline">"O! yes," replied Sir Charles, "you have had an impo&s;tor in town, who, with much ea&s;y familiarity and a&s;&s;urance, has &s;tolen my wri|tings, &amp;c. and not only robbed me, but has al&s;o
<PB N="72" REF="72">
impudently dared to a&s;&s;ume my name; but I am the true Sir Charles Buck.</Q> This occa&s;ioned a great roar, the only one I remember to have heard du|ring the farce, unle&s;s to Mrs. Clive.</P>
<P>As January 1759 had pinched, &s;o February, in|&s;tead of being more calm and quiet, made the air of Covent Garden far from being &s;oftened; for it nipt the wit with increa&s;ing &s;everity. Foote there|fore, as a re&s;ource, wrote to the manager at Edin|burgh.&mdash;Callender (as near as I can remember) was the name of that commander; the theatre at that time in Scotland was only a &s;muggling ve&s;&s;el, but now it is enlarged and dubbed a royal man of war. Mr. Callender wrote Mr. Foote word, that him&s;elf and his company would be proud of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance for a few nights, and a&s;&s;ured him it was a compliment.</P>
<P>At that time birds of pa&s;&s;age from London to Scotland were experiments unknown&mdash;for it was judged impo&s;&s;ible for a London theatrical &s;unflower to &s;urvive the chillne&s;s of &s;uch a barbarous nor|thern clime; but opinions and experience, which make fools wi&s;e, have proved it to be not only a happy a&s;ylum, but as fine a hot-hou&s;e for the pre&s;ervation, and as good a nur&s;ery for rare and delicate theatrical plants as ever tho&s;e of Drury-Lane and Covent Garden could at any time produce, in &s;pight of the advantages that Co|vent

<P>Foote at Edinburgh (to u&s;e M'Ruthen's words) was <HI>quite a phaenomenon:</HI>&mdash;Every one in Lon|don &s;tared at his &s;trange di&s;po&s;ition, to adventure from the metropolis of England, a journey of four hundred miles to Edinburgh; and wondered that an actor of eminence &s;hould venture to a place, where at that time a &s;ixty pounds benefit was a trea&s;ure. But that is no more &s;urprizing at this juncture, than to mention that the facetious Captain Farquhar, only eighty years ago at Dublin, had 100l. which was then thought to be an enor|mous &s;um.</P>
<P>And my different accounts only verify the &s;ame degree of increa&s;e of receipts at Dublin; but then the public, when they recollect how well per|formers lived thirty years ago on le&s;s incomes than they now have, are too apt to forget the difference there now is in the price of lodgings, coals, can|dles, meat and drink, and in &s;hort in every article of life, as well as the very expen&s;ive ornaments for the &s;tage, with the very material article of hair-dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Edinburgh, where Mr. Foote fir&s;t pointed out the road for Londoners to make excur&s;ions to, has made the mo&s;t rapid &s;trides in arts, elegance, and luxury, of any place in the three kingdoms.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="74">
Dublin, though wonderfully improved, was, thirty-two years ago, a noble, populous, and ex|ten&s;ive city&mdash;Edinburgh was not, but it now real|ly is; and, for my own part, common hone&s;ty and honour compels me to remember I have often gone thither and often returned, and never had to re-cro&s;s the Tweed again for Scotland but my heart felt a &s;ecret plea&s;ure at the thought of vi&s;iting once more tho&s;e who&s;e attachments had been la&s;t|ing, and not vani&s;hed like the vapours of a day.</P>
<P>Mr. Foote's trip to the North an&s;wered much better than was expected; the &s;tage at that time being a place of re&s;ort in Edinburgh only for &s;uch independent per&s;ons as dared to judge for them|&s;elves, and venture into that &s;eat of profanation.</P>
<P>It was but in the year 1756 the Rev. Mr. Home was &s;o di&s;&s;olute as to bring out his tragedy of Dou|glas in the Edinburgh old theatre in the Canon|gate; for which heinous offence the elders of the kirk doomed him to bani&s;hment and excommuni|cation for writing and bringing on a public &s;tage a piece to be exhibited by play actors in Satan's tabernacle. This bigotry has worn off; and as extremes are often the &s;ub&s;equent con&s;equence, I believe Edinburgh may vie with its neighbours in having many per&s;ons not too much troubled with attending tho&s;e duties of religion, for which that city once boa&s;ted in a violent degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>

Foote, when he received Callender's invitation, talked as familiarly of &s;etting off as if he had been only going to Drury-Lane theatre, where the boxes were open to him; but on his prepara|tion for his Scotch journey, when his hand went into his pocket, it &s;oon reminded him there wan|ted the needful, both for going abroad or &s;taying at home.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well," &s;ays he, "This Scotch ex|periment mu&s;t be tried, but where's the means?

But then he lent it <HI>like</HI> Mr. Garrick: for, tho' he cho&s;e to grant the favour to Mr. Foote, yet he could not omit his love of parade on the occa&s;ion; for when he &s;aid <HI>yes,</HI> he did not do it generou&s;ly and genteely, for fear the world &s;hould not know it, but told Mr. Foote he would &s;ee Pritchard at noon, and he (Mr. Foote) might draw on him in the evening for the &s;um, and leave his note of acknowledgment for the &s;ame. Foote did not reli&s;h the humiliating &s;ituation to appear before the playhou&s;e trea&s;urer, as if reque&s;ting a boon from his ma&s;ter, nor could he a&s;k any gentleman of his acquaintance to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s for him, as thereby he mu&s;t betray his poverty. He did not approve of &s;ending his &s;ervant; and as each of the&s;e modes &s;eemed to le&s;&s;en his con&s;equence, he at la&s;t determined to apply to me&mdash;with, <Q REND="inline">"My

He ridiculed him much as a poet, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"David's ver&s;es were &s;o bad, (and Garrick &s;o fond of writing) that if he died fir&s;t, he dreaded the thoughts of his compo&s;ing his epitaph."</Q> This &s;atire was whim&s;ical and highly diverting; but certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ot doing Garrick ju&s;tice, as the public and the &s;tage are indebted to him for &s;eve|ral pieces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f great merit; and if he has not left &s;ufficient fame to &s;tand as one of the fir&s;t of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ets <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">et he is above mediocrity, and is &s;urely to be placed far &s;uperior to the wor&s;t; but

<P>From the time of Mr. Foote's benefit and his departure from London, I never had any inter|cour&s;e with King David: But I have omitted to mention, that on the evening of Mr. Foote's l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aving his lodgings in James's-&s;treet, and on my wi&s;hing him a profitable, plea&s;ant, and &s;afe journey, I reque&s;ted the favour of his perform|ance on my benefit night, which could not ac|cording to my rank of &s;alary happen till after his return from Scotland, which I &s;uppo&s;ed would be in about &s;ix weeks: I thought I was not only entitled, but had a right by my &s;ervices to him, both in London and Dublin, to expect my re|que&s;ted favour would be granted as &s;oon as a&s;ked; and indeed I wondered he had not prevented my a&s;king him, by fir&s;t offering me &s;uch a compli|ment, which in truth he a&s;&s;ured me was his in|tention and his wi&s;h, and complied with it as a plea&s;ure to him&s;elf, if he could by &s;uch a trifling t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">uble be of the lea&s;t &s;ervice to me, for whom he

<P>Soon after Mr. Foote's departure, I was engaged on a party one evening at the Bedford-Head Tavern, Southampton-&s;treet, which con&s;i&s;ted of Colonel Thornton, Colonel Boden, a Captain S&mdash;in the &s;ea-&s;ervice, my&s;elf, and others; after the hour of two the company thinned by degrees till only Colonel Thornton and my&s;elf remained, when in about ten minutes a waiter entered precipitately, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Wilkin&s;on was wanted on urgent bu&s;ine&s;s:"</Q> I could not conceive what matter of moment could require my attendance at &s;o late an hour; but in&s;tantly obeyed the &s;ummons, and was introduced into a parlour, where I found Captain S&mdash;&s;urrounded by waiters and the ho&s;t.

<P>Mr. Foote came to town in a few days; and in my bills and adverti&s;ements were publi&s;hed both play and farce, but luckily (as it proved) I had not in&s;erted Mr. Foote's name. I called to &s;ee him,
<PB N="82" REF="82">
and had rea&s;on to believe he was denied: I called a &s;econd time, and was then admitted; I congra|tulated him on his return, and informed him of my reliance on his fulfilling his promi&s;e by per|forming for my benefit, which was to be on the 14th of May; and on that full dependence I had adverti&s;ed the Diver&s;ions of the Morning, and had the plea&s;ure to inform him my boxes were all taken. Foote, after coughing and taking a quantity of &s;nuff, and plucking his chin with tweezers, a con&s;tant habit of his in private life; at length coolly replied, <Q REND="inline">"That as a young man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e wi&s;hed me &s;ucce&s;s in the world; but was hurt to ob&s;erve, the publi&s;hing his farce was an un|warrantable freedom.

<P>The reader will recollect what a winter of con|fu&s;ion and turbulence I had undergone.&mdash;The money I had certainly drawn by the &s;weat of my brow. He had fea&s;ted on my labour, and had lived in clover, while I was merely buffetted from pillar to po&s;t. I de&s;ired he would not by any means neglect his health or his letters of con|&s;equence, for that I not only took my leave of him for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t day, but was determined never more to trouble him with a &s;econd vi&s;it: However, to try him further, I &s;aid, as the farce was adverti&s;ed, my lo&s;s would be irreparable if not performed, and hoped he would not add additional cruelty by inflicting a puni&s;hment unmerited, by the refu&s;al of the copy of his farce. He &s;ternly replied, in|deed he &s;hould; he had a reputation to lo&s;e, and would not hazard the repre&s;entation of any piece of his not printed, to be mutilated, &s;poiled, and condemned by my ignorant bungling. Here the vi&s;it ended, and I left him mo&s;t truly with an hone&s;t contempt, and &s;aid to him, when at the door, <Q REND="inline">"Farewell Mr. Foote!"</Q> and determined never more to renew our acquaintance.</P>

<P>Garrick's eyes &s;parkled with plea&s;ure, and betray|ed a &s;atisfaction he wi&s;hed to conceal. He inwardly hated Foote (and not altogether without rea&s;on); he wi&s;hed to frown, but with all his ingenuity and cunning he was not an actor equal to the ta&s;k, for he could not hold back any longer his con&s;ent, and &s;aid he was really unhappy at the ill u&s;age I had received from <Q REND="inline">"that Foote."</Q> Foote owed me a recompence for my great &s;ervices; but if I had lo&s;t a fal&s;e friend, I &s;hould find in him a true one; but he mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that he expected I would not make a bad u&s;e of his kindne&s;s, but plant my mimicry again&s;t Foote alone, as he was a proper object, and he wi&s;hed every &s;ucce&s;s to my benefit and performance: Nay, he was &s;o ge|nerous, that he in&s;i&s;ted on a bottle of wine being brought and after the &s;econd gla&s;s, he a&s;ked me if I would drink any more? but carefully at the &s;ame time put the cork into the bottle: <Q REND="inline">"No more, Sir."</Q> Nay he was &s;o generous on that occa|&s;ion as to give me a neat new edition of Othello, worth one &s;hilling and &s;ixpence, which I have to this day pre&s;erved, and have piou&s;ly tran&s;mitted it to my &s;on. When parting with him he a&s;&s;u|red me, that he was &s;o much hurt at the ill-treat|ment
<PB N="86" REF="86">
I had received from Foote, that he never would make any future agreement with him: which, though merely words to plea&s;e me on our reconciliation, were prophetic; as from that &s;ea|&s;on it was not until the Minor happened to &s;ucceed, two years after, that Mr. Foote acted by engagement with Mr. Garrick: a long time, when we con&s;ider Garrick had &s;poken&mdash;<Q><L>As heroes, &s;tates, and kingdoms ri&s;e and fall:</L>

<P>I promi&s;ed him not to introduce any mimicry that might tend to the lea&s;t likene&s;s whatever of the performers of either theatre; and reflection, and a little experience, &s;oon convinced me it was nece&s;&s;ary to act with every caution, and to &s;a|crifice a little applau&s;e to the pro&s;pect of here|after obtaining &s;ub&s;tantial pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>The wi&s;hed-for night arrived; a &s;plendid and a crowded hou&s;e.&mdash;Lady Granard, Lady Tyrawly, Sir Francis Delaval, the Duke of Portland, the Captains Dives's, the Hanways, Mrs. Jones Skel|ton,

&amp;c. &amp;c. had &s;ecured all my boxes. My acquaintance, with &s;uch particular intere&s;t, aided by public curio&s;ity, a full theatre cannot be a matter of great &s;urpri&s;e to relate.</P>
<P>Othello being the fir&s;t character I had attempt|ed in London, alarmed me much, particularly as the name of my mimicry had le&s;&s;ened all hopes of my being an actor in proportion as that reputa|tion aro&s;e, for every idea had been well circulated with indefatigable pains by the &s;everal families of the Sneers, the Blandi&s;hes, and the Candours. In the collaring &s;cene, in act the third, I not only received repeated plaudits, but even a huzza!&mdash;Yet what was really extraordinary I &s;unk again into a languor and &s;tupid &s;amene&s;s, which never was or yet has been one of my faults in the long catalogue, and that I &s;hould be &s;o &s;tupidly dull and awkward with a crowd of friends is &s;urpri|&s;ing! Indeed the only rea&s;on I can even now &s;ug|ge&s;t, was my heart and &s;oul being &s;o taken up with my public and dangerous attack on Mr. Foote, and that by undertaking a long and fatiguing cha|racter, with the almo&s;t certainty of chill and cold to fix an in&s;tant hoar&s;ene&s;s, which I have gene|rally found to be the ca&s;e after playing a Moori&s;h part. This &s;hould &s;till be a le&s;&s;on for young and old performers never to run &s;uch a hazardous trial, by attempting too much in &s;earch of fame;
<PB N="88" REF="88">
for by tho&s;e means they let &s;lip the ball they might with caution catch. I had not only, when heated, the black to remove from my neck and face by repeated attempts with cold pomatum and great plenty of water and &s;oap to &s;cour them clean, but twice after to dre&s;s from top to toe&mdash;fir&s;t as Lady Pentweazle&mdash;then as Mr. Foote in the &s;e|cond act of the farce: But youth with good &s;pi|rits, accompanied with applau&s;e, can do won|ders.</P>
<P>My Lady Pentweazle went off with every &s;uc|ce&s;s my mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes could wi&s;h for; but when I came on in the very dre&s;s Foote had worn, and as Mr. Foote, the audience &s;eemed ac|tually a&s;toni&s;hed; and, from that point being gain|ed, I really was for the remainder of the evening per&s;uaded by the height of fancy that <HI>I was Mr. Foote.</HI> I gave all the particulars he had done, with the imitation of his puppets, and a new Ita|lian burletta of my own compo&s;ing, in the manner of the favourite burletta-&s;ingers then at the Opera Hou&s;e; and what mo&s;t highly plea&s;ed, was the conver&s;ation &s;cene between Mr. and Mrs. Cad|wallader, as Mr. Foote and Mrs. Clive, which cheered the audience, as they had not &s;een it for two years: Peals of laughter attended the per|formance, and, I may add, &s;houts of applau&s;e all my &s;trokes on Mr. Foote.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="89">
When the curtain dropped great congratula|tions followed, with &s;uch heart-felt &s;atisfaction to my&s;elf, as made me judge, like Shift in the Minor, that <Q REND="inline">"<HI>thinking my&s;elf</HI> pretty near equal to my ma|&s;ter, I made him one of his own bows, and &s;et up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or my&s;elf."</Q>&mdash;But more of that &s;peech will occur in its proper place, as he wrote Shift as a &s;atirical level&mdash;a cap to fit me&mdash;which cap turned out the riche&s;t I ever wore, and entirely at my ma&s;ter Foote's expence.</P>
<P>My friend Jo&s;eph Au&s;tin's benefit was to be on the Wedne&s;day following, May the 16th, the Fair Quaker of Deal, and the farce of the Ap|prentice, in which farce he had de&s;ired me to per|form a new &s;cene: the Apprentice, (the fir&s;t time) Mr. Au&s;tin: But the wonderful reception of my farce on the Monday occa&s;ioned him to alter his intentions, and de&s;ired me to repeat the &s;ame for him, which I was in true regard bound to pro|mi&s;e and perform. When Garrick came to the theatre on the Tue&s;day morning, (for he had kept out of the way for fear of my d&mdash;d tricks he &s;aid) Mr. Au&s;tin was there and informed him of the particulars of the Monday. Mr. Au&s;tin &s;aid, that he greatly enjoyed all Wilkin&s;on's &s;trokes upon Foote. Garrick then pretending to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Now, why Au&s;tin, now what d&mdash;d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> has this friend Tate of your's been at?

well, and now you want him to be at his tricks again on Wedne&s;day next? Well now, really, Au|&s;tin I will have no more to do with the&s;e d&mdash;d exotics:&mdash;But you &s;ay he really trimmed Foote well! ha! ha! ha!"</Q> In the mid&s;t of this cheer|ful &s;cene came a letter from the Lord Chamber|lain, couched in &s;evere terms for Mr. Wilkin&s;on's taking the liberty on Monday night to re&s;tore and act a &s;cene from the Author, which had been pro|hibited; it had given great offence to Mr. and Mrs. Aprice, and therefore it was expected no &s;uch rude infringement &s;hould be again repeated. Mr. Garrick was now really angry at being call|ed to an account for my breach of his theatric laws, but I had thought it va&s;tly clever, as it &s;upplied that part where my imitations of the performers were u&s;ually given. Mr. Au&s;tin brought me the intel|ligence, but it chagrined me much; for as I had executed that part &s;o well, it was taking a princi|pal feather from my gaudy newly-acquired plume: however, high authority had laid its weighty com|mands, and I was obliged, though much again&s;t my will, to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>The farce was neverthele&s;s acted, but with the Lord Chamberlain's cruel lopping off a principal limb; it went off va&s;tly well, but not with &s;uch acclamations as on my own night; for indeed, not having had time to prepare a &s;ub&s;titute to &s;upply
<PB N="91" REF="91">
the vacancy, was a &s;evere &s;troke on my perform|ance.</P>
<P>On my benefit I was favoured with many pre|&s;ents, which made my profit &s;till more lucrative.&mdash;Ten guineas from the Hon. Mi&s;s Foley, (Lord Foley's &s;i&s;ter) was pre&s;ented me by Mrs. Wardle, and a genteel douceur from her&s;elf, who had an upper box and filled it. Flu&s;hed with this good fortune we were as happy a mother and &s;on as the kingdom could boa&s;t.</P>
<P>The theatre clo&s;ed in about fourteen days after my benefit, and I began to prepare for my &s;um|mer campaign, which was once m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re de&s;tined for Port&s;mouth, the war &s;till continuing.</P>
<P>But in con&s;equence of &s;ome pique which had happened on my playing all the principal parts the year before, &s;everal had taken it &s;o much in dud|geon that a great de&s;ertion en&s;ued. The hero, Mr. Cook (alias Gentleman) who, though very lame and in years, had been the &s;tock Romeo, Mr. Gates, Mrs. Price, (who was afterwards mar|ried to Mr. Par&s;ons) Mrs. Mozeen, Mr. and Mrs. Fitzmaurice, all had invited them&s;elves on a jolly party for Scotland, where they had re|moved the winter before, and were fixed for &s;ome time in the Edinburgh company of comedians, and were there when Mr. Foote paid his fir&s;t vi|&s;it;
<PB N="92" REF="92">
as I believe was Mr. James Aikin, for I heard Mr. Foote, on his return from that place, &s;peak very highly of that gentleman; and I think it was that year.</P>
<P>This de&s;ertion of the Port&s;mouth troops made recruits quite nece&s;&s;ary, for which &s;upply old Mr. Kennedy, the commander, wrote to me and ap|pointed me agent; for my acquaintance and friends were &s;o powerful at Port&s;mouth as to make my a&s;&s;i&s;tance ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to their taking the &s;ield with &s;afety, or any hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. In&s;tead of engaging one tragedy queen, I enli&s;ted two, which did not turn out to my &s;atisfaction, as a Mrs. Daly was there, whom I had created empre&s;s the &s;ummer before, which rendered it next im|po&s;&s;ible for me to plea&s;e all the three. From Bath I got my good friend Mi&s;s Morri&s;on; from Lon|don a Mi&s;s Kitty White: Mi&s;s Kitty married a young man of the name of Burden the &s;ea&s;on I am mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ng; &s;o &s;he got ble&s;&s;ed with a hu&s;|band by my means.</P>
<P>Mrs. White, the mother, was a mo&s;t extraor|dinary character, and worthy of record; far from wanting &s;en&s;e and ob&s;ervation, &s;he was quick, lively, cunning, and &s;agacious, but had pa&s;&s;ions that out&s;tripped the wind, yet good-natured at times: All this variety, as differently tuned for
<PB N="93" REF="93">
good or ill temper, was aided by the fine&s;t &s;lip|&s;lop collection of words imaginable, that made her in truth, not only to my&s;elf, but to many others, an inexhau&s;tible fund of entertainment, and &s;he was to me beyond compare the mo&s;t diverting old lady I ever met with. Whenever Burden, her &s;on-in-law, gave offence, which was almo&s;t perpetually, &s;he u&s;ed thus to harangue her daughter, <Q REND="inline">"Ma'am, you have married a feller beneath you&mdash;you played Lucy la&s;t night in the Minor better than Mrs. Cib|ber could have done upon my &s;ould, and yet this &s;coundrol would hurt &s;uch a devine cretur!" "True, mama," replied her daughter, "but &s;up|po&s;e he &s;hould in de&s;pair and rage cut his throat?" "Cut his throat! let him cut his throat and go to the devil; but he won't cut his throat, no &s;uch good luck. But I'll tell you what ma'am, if you contradict me I'll fell you at my feet, and trample over your <HI>cor&s;e</HI> ma'am, for you are a limb, ma'am; your father on his death-bed told me you were a limb.&mdash;You are pure as <HI>ermind,</HI> ma'am, except with Sir Francis <HI>Dolvol,</HI> and you &s;han't live with your hu&s;band, ma'am; you have no bu|&s;ine&s;s, ma'am to live with your hu&s;band; the fir&s;t women of quality, ma'am, don't live with their hu&s;bands, ma'am.&mdash;Does Mrs. Elmy live with her hu&s;band?

<P>Mi&s;s K. White was a pupil of Mr. Rich's, and, during her initiation, Mr. O'Brien, of Drury-Lane theatre, gave her &s;ome in&s;tructions how to perform with propriety the character of Sylvia in the Recruiting Officer.&mdash;One day, as he was thus employed, ob&s;erving that the lady mi&s;con|ceived his directions, and repeated a pa&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ge very improperly, he told her &s;he ought to con&s;ider that the part &s;he was &s;peaking was a <HI>parenthe&s;is,</HI> and required a different tone of voice, and a greater degree of volubility, than the re&s;t of the &s;entence. <Q REND="inline">"A parenthe&s;is!" &s;aid Mi&s;s White, "what's that?"</Q>&mdash;Mrs. White, who happened to be pre|&s;ent, hearing this que&s;tion of her daughter's, and blu&s;hing that &s;he &s;hould thus betray her igno|rance, in&s;tantly broke out into the following po|lite and &s;en&s;ible exclamation:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"O! what an infernal limb of an actre&s;s will you make! What,

<P>With this young lady, Mi&s;s White, I &s;afely arrived at Port&s;mouth, and &s;oon &s;allied forth as Alexander, and appointed her my Statira. The brave Admiral Rodney was there, to whom I was much indebted for his generous, courteous, and genteel behaviour.</P>
<P>We opened on Wedne&s;day the 20th of June, 1759, with the Provoked Hu&s;band; Lord Townly (with an occa&s;ional prologue) Mr. Wilkin&s;on, and Manly by Mr. Moody&mdash;his fir&s;t appearance on that &s;tage. Here was my fir&s;t acquaintance with my good friend Mr. Moody, to whom I have been often much obliged. I here beg leave to a&s;&s;ure Mr. Moody I hold him in great regard, and &s;hall never forget, but ever remember him with the highe&s;t plea&s;ure and e&s;teem.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="96">
Mr. Moody arrived at Port&s;mouth from Ja|maica, and in his hand led from the lucky bark (that wafted him &s;afe to England) a lady to whom he paid due attention, a Mrs. O&s;borne. She was a &s;en&s;ible woman, and had not lo&s;t time while abroad, as her wai&s;t was not one of the mo&s;t &s;lim. She made her appearance in the Mourning Bride; and though O&s;myn pronounces in the third act that <Q REND="inline">"She is &s;till his bride, the my&s;terious rites delayed, nor has the Hymenial torch yet lighted up his la&s;t mo&s;t grateful &s;acrifice;"</Q> which proves the meeting in the pri&s;on to have been the fir&s;t after the marriage ceremony. But our Port&s;|mouth Almeria was &s;o clever, &s;he evinced beyond doubt that &s;he was pregnant in the fourth act; and in act the fifth &s;he could not continue till her coronation, but &s;he (the Mourning Bride) was obliged to be carried to her &s;tate-bed, where &s;he was delivered of a brave chopping heir to Gra|nada.</P>
<P>I called the next day to inquire after her health, and found the lady dre&s;&s;ed and &s;itting at a table, perfectly well, &s;helling peas for her dinner. In a few days we had a merry chri&s;tening; I was one godfather, and think my friend Moody was a god|father, or &s;ome kind of a father&mdash;which, he knows
<PB N="97" REF="97">
be&s;t.&mdash;This &s;hort relation is &s;trictly matter of fact.</P>
<P>Mr. Moody had, from his merit as an actor, and by a&s;&s;iduity as a man of in&s;pection and know|ledge, made that proper u&s;e of his time which every one &s;hould (but what few do) practice; he returned to England after having gained (and not &s;quandered away, but &s;ecured) a property of con|&s;equence, and by proper attention has increa&s;ed it in yearly &s;ervice to the pre&s;ent day, and will prove Mr. Moody had an invaluable friend not only thirty years ago, but will &s;tand the te&s;t to the la&s;t: I wi&s;h I had thought and acted as wi&s;ely as he has done.</P>
<P>Mr. Moody's O'Flaherty, and many principal comic characters have been, and are &s;till, felt and acknowledged, and will be on theatrical record &s;ome years to come, and keep a remembrance for his tomb-&s;tone to tell&mdash;WHOSE DUST LI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">S HERE&mdash;but I tru&s;t and hope, ere that time ar|rives, he will enjoy many happy days and years.</P>
<P>His being at Port&s;mouth &s;ecured him a lucky tran&s;plantation to London, that hot-bed of ge|nius, which circum&s;tance will pre&s;ently occur.</P>
<P>I revived the play of Alexander, and performed &s;everal new characters, one of which was Shylock, (for my friend Moody's benefit) but without

knowing ten regular lines;&mdash;al&s;o pre&s;ented the Diver&s;ions of the Morning.</P>
<P>I had two clear benefits&mdash;the fir&s;t was on Mon|day, July 9, E&s;&s;ex, Tea, (for I lived almo&s;t on my Tea) with the fir&s;t night of the Guardian.&mdash;In the bills, <HI>by de&s;ire,</HI> pit and fir&s;t gallery at the &s;ame price, and nothing under full price during the whole performance.</P>

The farce was the Chaplet.&mdash;As I was paying attention, in the fifth act, to Mr. Moody's Grave-digger, Mr. Kennedy (the manager) pluck|ed me by the &s;leeve, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mind what you do, for Mr. Garrick is in the pit!"</Q>&mdash;It rather alarmed me; but having time before my entrance to reconnoitre, and not finding any likene&s;s I looked upon it as a joke; and not hearing from any per&s;on that he had been &s;een, and &s;o well known, I went out to &s;upper and &s;taid late:&mdash;But the next morning, July 24, I was waked by a me&s;&s;enger from the Fountain Tavern, with Mr. Garrick's invitation to breakfa&s;t: I was of cour&s;e a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch an unexpected vi&s;itant at Port&s;|mouth, and wondered &s;till more at the occa&s;ion, which in my hurried thoughts I could not de|vi&s;e.

<P>After breakfa&s;t we walked on the ramparts, and then went to the dock-yards; he was in &s;uch good &s;pirits that he ordered a bottle of hock to be made into a cool tankard, with balm, &amp;c.

<P>My reader may be certain that whenever Mr. Garrick cho&s;e to throw off acting and dignity, and was not &s;urrounded by bu&s;ine&s;s to perplex him, he had it in his power to render him&s;elf a mo&s;t plea&s;ing, improving, and delightful companion.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick's walking arm in arm with me, was an honour I dreamed not of. He congratu|lated me on being &s;o great a favourite; and what, he &s;aid, was of much more &s;ervice, the being &s;o well acquainted with the leading people at that
<PB N="103" REF="103">
place, of which, by inquiry, he &s;oon heard all particulars; told me, he was on a vi&s;it at Dr. Gar|ney's, a gentleman of eminence who lived at Wickham, about eight miles from Port&s;mouth, to the left of Port&s;down, once a phy&s;ician, but had given over practi&s;ing&mdash;his fortune being fully equal to ea&s;e and affluence. Mr. Garrick told me this vi&s;it had been for years promi&s;ed, but not paid till now; &s;aid, that Dr. Garney was an old and inti|mate friend, and he &s;hould be there &s;even or eight days: Mrs. Garrick was there, and had &s;ent him as a me&s;&s;enger, with Dr. Garney's compliments and her commands to in&s;i&s;t that I would fix my own day, and give them the plea&s;ure of my company, which vi&s;it they would all return: So, Tate, &s;ays my kind Mr. Garrick, mind you are well provided, for we &s;hall make it early in next week. This obliging invitation I gladly complied with, dre&s;&s;ed in my be&s;t, and even of that he took notice, and &s;aid all was well except my buckles, which being (in the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion) large, and low on the in|&s;tep, he ob&s;erved were like a &s;ailor's. I did not want for lace to make me a gentleman&mdash;not ab&s;urd then&mdash;but &s;uch a figure now would be laughed at as it pa&s;&s;ed along.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick received me at the Doctor's more like his &s;on than merely a common acquaintance, to whom he meant only to be civil and well-bred:
<PB N="104" REF="104">
Nor was Mrs. Garrick a jot le&s;s kind; &s;he &s;corned to be ontdone in courte&s;y, and met me with all that apparent regard as if a beloved relation had ju&s;t arrived from the Ea&s;t-Indies. She was in truth a mo&s;t elegant woman:&mdash;grace was in her &s;tep.&mdash;I was introduced to Dr. Garney, his lady, and &s;on, and after that to company who were quite &s;trangers to me. They appeared ju&s;t like what were their univer&s;al well-known character, every thing that was good, with power and will to render their plea&s;ant man&s;ion a happy re&s;ort for their acquain|tance; the &s;ituation was a little paradi&s;e in every re&s;pect that art and nature could contribute to make &s;o; it appeared to me to much advan|tage, as the four immediate miles from Port&s;|mouth till you reach Hil&s;ey barracks, the coun|try is very indifferent, very dreary, and all con|fined, for tho&s;e four miles are regular fortifications, ditches with draw-bridges, &amp;c.; &s;o that if it was not for the ramparts next the &s;ea, with that beautiful pro&s;pect of the I&s;le of Wight, the ocean, and the &s;hipping, Port&s;mouth would be a very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation. In &s;hort, much as I liked that re&s;idence I never could approve of it as a plea&s;ant &s;ummer retreat, the ramparts being the only good walk, and tho&s;e &s;o expo&s;ed to the &s;un and reflection from the water, that it made the evening intolerable; nor has there been a po&s;&s;ibility I fancy, from the
<PB N="105" REF="105">
la&s;t time I was there, to have formed &s;uch a com|fortable re&s;ource as that of a cool and plea&s;ant walk: Though when once arrived on Port&s;down, ample amends is made to tho&s;e who are on hor&s;e|back or in a carriage, as it certainly mu&s;t be, (I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e) all open to the view of the coun|try behind; and then by its other overlooking Port&s;mouth, the fleet, I&s;le of Wight, St. Helen's, and beyond Southampton, it mu&s;t at lea&s;t be one of the fine&s;t pro&s;pects in the world.</P>
<P>My entertainment for the day (for I was at Dr. Garney's before twelve) was as if calculated to plea&s;e a man of fa&s;hion. As to Mr. Garrick, he, being much the younge&s;t man of the two, took me (for two hours) to every part of the hou&s;e and garden that was worth ob&s;ervation, and to the high top of an ob&s;ervatory, built by the Doctor for &s;tudy, curio&s;ity, and pro&s;pect, and very near equal to that ju&s;t mentioned of Port&s;down. Mr. Garrick ran and &s;kipped about like a lad of twenty.&mdash;Indeed civility and kindne&s;s &s;eemed the &s;tudy of the day from him and the whole family, and were vi&s;ibly the intention and practice towards me.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick had heard my benefit was over; but when I informed him I was to have another, he &s;trongly recommended my night to the pa|tronage of that worthy family; and &s;aid, he would take it equally as an obligation conferred
<PB N="106" REF="106">
on him&s;elf, if be&s;towed on his friend Mr. Wil|kin&s;on&mdash;(there was honour!)&mdash;for I was a youth who&s;e pro&s;perity he had at heart, becau&s;e I was de|&s;erving; and added, unle&s;s that had been his opi|nion of me he had not invited or recommended me to the honour of Dr. Garney's friend&s;hip. After tea, coffee, &amp;c. we fini&s;hed the evening with playing at bowls on the green and in walking. I did not leave Wickham till ten o'clock at night, and received a general invitation to make that hou&s;e my own, whenever convenience permitted or inclination prompted me. I remember, when talking of plays that day after dinner, Mr. Gar|rick &s;aid, that he never acted but to one bad hou&s;e, and that was Abel Drugger, when there was not 40l. in the theatre.</P>
<P>On my departure from this &s;o truly agreeable day, never to be obliterated, Mr. Garrick gave me the play of Barbaro&s;&s;a, to be ready in that cha|racter, and to &s;tudy Glo&s;ter in Jane Shore, and jokingly &s;aid, he hoped there would not be any impropriety in be&s;peaking a play for Friday, July 27;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"and we de&s;ire, Wilkin&s;on, you will fix on a favourite character, and do your be&s;t for the credit of both; and damn it, Tate, Mrs. Garrick ex|pects you will have a Di&s;h of Tea ready after her jaunt, by way of relaxation; and if you di&s;appoint us, Dr. and Mrs. Garney, and all the party will

He e&s;corted me to my chai&s;e, and for the &s;econd time in his life made me very happy; for I on my part never wanted gratitude or a pride to ob|tain his good opinion. But our &s;tate of mind &s;o fluctuates that it is merely a common barometer&mdash;<HI>'Tis true, 'tis pity, and pity 'tis 'tis true.</HI></P>
<P>I had promi&s;ed more, much more than I could make good, for I had not the lea&s;t doubt but any play I appointed would be granted &s;ervilely with a bow, when authori&s;ed by the name of Garrick. Here, however, I was mi&s;taken, for the next day when I &s;ummoned the company, the three or four thea|trical potentates in power pertaining to the petty &s;tate were very refractory, each wanting to be principal on the occa&s;ion; and by a majority of votes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> lo&s;t my lieutenancy, nor was I by my&s;elf, for Mr. Moody was not &s;uffered on any account to be capital on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>A Mr. White was the yearly Garrick, who&s;e fame &s;ounded and re&s;ounded from the county of Devon to the bounds of Hamp&s;hire, therefore neither he, nor they would permit any di&s;play of mine, as each wanted to be a &s;urpri&s;ing actor, and be elected by due right of merit in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rury-Lane hou&s;e of lords and commons.

<P>So Mr. White who was lord paramount, after as much altercation as would &s;ettle an addre&s;s to the Mini&s;ter, fixed on the Beggar's Opera, Fri|day, July 27th, 1759; Macheath, Mr. White, and Mr. Moody was permitted to have the honour of acting Lockit. I was allowed to give Tea, and by particular de&s;ire, to plea&s;e me, was added the Author, Cadwallader by me of cour&s;e. It was with difficulty I could re&s;erve twelve <HI>good</HI> &s;eats, as all the genteel people, on hearing that Mr. Gar|rick and his lady were to be there, had crowded early to the theatre; the fir&s;t act was fini&s;hed and no Mr. Garrick had appeared, and on the &s;econd act beginning, the audience and the performers blamed me for having a&s;&s;erted a fal&s;ehood, and by way of a hum collected them to be di&s;appointed,
<PB N="109" REF="109">
and I really began to think it &s;trange my&s;elf; but to my great relief and &s;atisfaction, about the mid|dle of the &s;econd act, in my party came, which was to me a gratifying triumph, as Mr. White was very angry at having played &s;o much of his Macheath and Mr. Ga&mdash;ick not pre&s;ent. They were &s;oon &s;ettled and paid much attention, and very con&s;iderately and kindly Mr. and Mrs. Gar|rick and their party made a point of obliging me by conferring &s;trong marks of approbation.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick was &s;o plea&s;ed with my friend Mr. Moody, in Lockit, that he &s;ent for him the next morning and engaged him for the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on, at a &s;alary of thirty &s;hillings per week, becau&s;e he told him he <HI>loved to encourage merit!</HI> Mr. Moody obtained Mr. Garrick's promi&s;e that he might make his <HI>entr&eacute;e</HI> in the character of King Henry VIII. Mr. Garrick after the &s;arce, came round and in&s;i&s;ted on my &s;upping with them at the Foun|tain Tavern; the noble troop of &s;trangers were much increa&s;ed by the addition of &s;everal gentle|men, particularly as all the medical people of con|&s;equence belonging to the place went to pay their compliments to their acquaintances, Dr. Gar|ney and family, and al&s;o to Mr. and Mrs. Gar|rick. Mrs. Garrick very politely thanked me for my performance, which before &s;o many people certainly appeared re&s;pectful, attentive,
<PB N="110" REF="110">
and kind; and I judged my fortune made.&mdash;O fickle fortune!</P>
<P>About half pa&s;t twelve Mrs. Garrick was for retiring, and as one of Dr. Garney's friends had provided them beds, (not &s;uffering them to &s;leep at the tavern,) Mrs. Garrick had to walk up the &s;treet to her de&s;tined apartment; Mr. Gar|rick, who never failed in attention to his lady, would not tru&s;t her to the &s;ervant's care only, but would him&s;elf attend her, and then return back to the company. He ob&s;erved I came that evening in a very large hand&s;ome &s;ea-captain's cloak, which he &s;aid he admired much, and he would with my leave wear it to attend Mrs. Gar|rick to her re&s;idence. All the ladies went at the &s;ame time to private hou&s;es, and the great little man wrapped him&s;elf in my <HI>then</HI> honoured roquelaure. He &s;oon returned, &s;aid he was plea|&s;ed with his walk, as it had made him &s;o well ac|quainted with my cloak, and which he thought would be &s;o comfortable for the winter, that if he had one, many a walk &s;hould he take in it, in|&s;tead of going in a &s;edan from Southampton-&s;treet to Drury-Lane; therefore reque&s;ted I would not leave Port&s;mouth without procuring &s;uch ano|ther, and take it to London for him.</P>
<P>The evening was very chatty; he had all atten|tion paid him, and in con&s;equence &s;hewed him&s;elf
<PB N="111" REF="111">
to great advantage. He a&s;ked me if I had &s;een <HI>that d&mdash;d Foote?</HI> I an&s;wered "No." To which he replied with vehemence, he hoped, for my &s;ake, I never would, if I could avoid it, ei|ther &s;ee or &s;peak to him again. What all this violent kindne&s;s proceeded from I never could account for: However I thought then, and do to this hour think my&s;elf highly obliged; for, to the ob&s;erver, it bore every mark of &s;incere benevo|lence and regard.</P>
<P>It was three in the morning before the party broke up, a very uncommon hour for him, he took a mo&s;t cordial and friendly leave, and I was much plea&s;ed with my affable, and agreeable en|tertainment, and wi&s;hed him a good morning, and a &s;afe and plea&s;ant journey to his &s;eat at Hampton-Court, for which place he was to &s;et forward in two or three days.</P>
<P>My &s;econd benefit was on Wene&s;day the 29th of Augu&s;t, DOUGLAS, TEA, and LETHE. My characters were Douglas, Old Man, and Lord Chalk&s;tone.&mdash;I thought it would be rude and im|politic when this ceremony grew near, if I did not, according to the repeated invitations I had recei|ved, wait on Dr. Garney at Wickham. I hired the hand&s;ome&s;t hor&s;e I could, thinking that a po&s;t chai&s;e for the day looked idle as well as extrava|gant for a di&s;tance of only eight miles, though
<PB N="112" REF="112">
not a &s;ailor in Port&s;mouth but would have proved a better jockey than my&s;elf. To make which clear I mu&s;t relate my John Gilpin's ride to Wickham, which has made me dread hor&s;eback ever &s;in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e. I had &s;eldom u&s;ed my&s;elf to that mode of travel|ling; for though I had frequently gone from Lon|don to Hampton-Court and Richmond, yet it was generally in a po&s;t chai&s;e, which ever was and is my favourite method of pa&s;&s;ing from place to place.</P>
<P>The o&s;tler of the Fountain brought to my door a very fine looking hor&s;e, and ob&s;erving I wore &s;purs, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Pray Mr. Wilkin&s;on, do you often ride on hor&s;eback?"</Q> I a&s;&s;ured him the con|trary: <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e," added he, "I beg then, Sir, as you are not a jockey, that I may take them off, for the hor&s;e I have brought is &s;o very &s;pirited, it may be dangerous for you to keep them on."</Q> to this di&s;arrangement I a&s;&s;ented, and for the fir&s;t mile, though hemmed in by the draw-bridges, and going on gently, found it was very difficult, either by giving the hor&s;e his own way or checking him, to keep him within the power of my art of hor&s;e|man&s;hip, but entertained hopes when I got into the open road by putting him into a canter that I &s;hould do very well. By degrees the hor&s;e &s;eem|ed wi&s;ely to comprehend that his own &s;elf-will and &s;agacity were &s;uperior to his rider's; my ig|norance
<PB N="113" REF="113">
was manife&s;t to the animal, and as he was fully convinced I a&s;&s;umed a government to which I was not by any means competent he was determined on rebellion, and to him&s;elf u&s;urped the reins of power. The renewal of it to my fancy, even now, makes me giddy, and I verily believe from that hour my brain was weakened, which mu&s;t plead &s;ome apology; and it is a re|mark of truth, that in almo&s;t every accident, whe|ther by falls down &s;tairs or in the &s;treet, from &s;ix years old my unfortunate head has always &s;uffered. The&s;e brui&s;es on recovery may in &s;ome degree ac|count for heavine&s;s and &s;tupidity, and naturally for the luminary rays not to have &s;hone forth &s;o bright as I wi&s;hed them: Even the night when I broke my leg, my head was &s;o jarred on the pave|ment as to occa&s;ion a violent &s;tun, and then &s;uch excrutiating pain as ab&s;olved all notion or feeling of my leg being in the lea&s;t injured, till endeavour|ing to walk on my recovery from the pain, my leg already broke, unable to do its office, let me down and &s;napped the ancle bone.</P>
<P>After having achieved near two miles with &s;afe|ty, my Bucephalus &s;et off like mad, I not being able by any means to keep my &s;addle, but &s;at in a &s;tate of fear and terror: In about half a mile, after he had got into this wild freek, in the nar|row road I met the London waggon, where with
<PB N="114" REF="114">
care there was &s;carce room to pa&s;s by it, but to which this dreadful bea&s;t ru&s;hed, that the wheel &s;topped and checked my right leg and brought me to the ground, and on my fall the hor&s;e's hind foot &s;truck my jaw, and made it bleed mo&s;t plen|tifully. Providentially the men &s;topped the wag|gon, but almo&s;t again&s;t their will, for they could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> conceive from the fury of the bea&s;t, and the &s;uppo&s;ed mi&s;guided rage of the rider, but I was &s;ome fooli&s;h mad fellow eager to &s;hew my hor&s;e|man&s;hip, neck or nothing.</P>
<P>The waggoners behaved with more civility than is u&s;ual for &s;uch animals; for in general they cer|tainly are merely &s;uch. They only damned me for <HI>a fowl;</HI> for they were <HI>right zure I mun be mad to ride dumb bea&s;t to fright the waggon like.</HI> But when I declared my innocence, as to any intend|ed violence on their carriage, and told them the real cau&s;e they thought it a very good joke and pronounced <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould never be a &s;port&s;man &s;uf|ficient to win the King's plate at Newmarket."</Q></P>
<P>While I was wiping off the du&s;t and blood, and was really much brui&s;ed, and with rea&s;on alarmed, for had not the waggoners, from &s;eeing Gilpin's certain danger &s;topped the waggon, I mu&s;t have experienced a &s;hocking death, by being cru&s;hed under the wheels, near thirty years before this day of relation, or at be&s;t I could only have ex|i&s;ted
<PB N="115" REF="115">
as a dreadful &s;pectacle, the gay mettled cour&s;er having di&s;engaged him&s;elf of his rider, was all the time feeding on &s;uch odd bits of gra&s;s as he could find. I was helped on his back and rea&s;&s;umed the reins with as much ea&s;e, as if no accident had occurred, and I had only mounted a lady's gentle pad.</P>
<P>The waggoners de&s;ired me not to ride again like a devil upon the king's high road, for I might have &s;een <HI>waggon like,</HI> and at the &s;ame time have &s;een there was not room to pa&s;s it, and poor bea&s;t was &s;o quiet, it mu&s;t have been all my fault. I bore this &s;econd lecture with patience, &s;o thanked Mr. Waggoner, and proceeded on my journey; for as to dwelling longer on my ignorance it was &s;ufficiently explained, and would have only in|crea&s;ed their contempt, not created pity, and there|fore would be a lo&s;s of time to us all, as our journey's end was quite contrary to attain.</P>
<P>I determined to be very &s;teady and not venture on the perilous canter any more, a gentle trot at the mo&s;t was to &s;uffice, and that with all precau|tion; we were jogging on as if by mutual agree|ment with great regularity and compo&s;ure, when an officer, who was going to Hil&s;ey Barracks, cried out, <Q REND="inline">"Your friend SCOTT dines at Hil&s;ey&mdash;do come to dinner, Wilkin&s;on,"</Q>&mdash;and went galloping on; my fiery footed &s;teed, &s;corning to be outdone

in courte&s;y, obeyed the &s;ummons with the utmo&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s, not by any means waiting to hear or con|&s;ult my opinion as to the invitation, while Gilpin like, I held by the pummel of the &s;addle out of breath, and expected every in&s;tant my neck would be broke: I was at the la&s;t ga&s;p with this devil of a hor&s;e; for the officer had no thought but I was determined to out-ride him, and be at Hil&s;ey the fir&s;t. I found pulling or holding like Major Sturgeon by the main, was all to no purpo&s;e, and every moment &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould be &s;prawling on the ground; but on &s;eeing the turnpike I cried out aloud, <Q REND="inline">"Shut the gate! Murder! murder!

to my a&s;toni&s;hment, in the mid&s;t of horrors, he plea&s;ingly &s;urpri&s;ed me by &s;o doing, for he &s;eemed equal to any mad exploit whatever.&mdash;Here I &s;tayed and got a gla&s;s of water, and from the turnpike for about a mile to the left, on the irregular paths of Port&s;down, I expected he had &s;ettled to rea&s;on, and had tried my &s;kill in hor&s;e|man&s;hip &s;ufficiently; but on the up hill and down dale once more he began, and more &s;wift than ever, without a chance of my meeting with any cottage, or modern &s;hepherd or &s;hepherde&s;s, in ca&s;e of accident or misfortune, having quite left the public road. For me to expatiate on the wonders I this day performed in the noble art of vaulting hor&s;eman&s;hip, might make young A&s;tley fearful of a rival, and dare me to a trial of &s;kill. The &s;en&s;ible bea&s;t certainly knew what an in&s;igni|ficant Major he had on his back, and determined to make a fri&s;ky day of it at my expence. I was in hopes till he took this third unlucky frolic all would have been well, and that the head&s;trong &s;ervant was &s;en&s;ible of the errors he had already committed, and I began to fancy my&s;elf an ele|gant prancer, when he rapidly flew with me to a precipice of very con&s;iderable height, where I thought he would for his own &s;ake have &s;topped his carreer; but to convince me he was &s;uperior to fear, and &s;corned even imminent danger, down
<PB N="118" REF="118">
he plunged headlong to the bottom. I have &s;een &s;omething like this heroic action in an old pan|tomime of Mr. Rich's, called Per&s;eus and An|dromeda; where Per&s;eus, like a flaming god, &s;u&s;pended by a wheel of large circumference, was whirled with great velocity around the theatric clouds, and &s;truck with his mighty &s;word the frightful Gorgon, who mid&s;t raging billows was ready to &s;eize the chained Andromeda, his wi&s;hed-for prey: One fatal evening the wheel and pul|lies broke, and down fell Per&s;eus on the harm|le&s;s &s;tuffed dragon, and in&s;tantly the curtain was dropped to hide the di&s;grace, and to ha&s;ten to the relief of the before lofty air-riding god.</P>
<P>It needs not the traveller's talent to point mine out as a frightful &s;ituation in every re&s;pect, as my|&s;elf and hor&s;e had taken the dreadful plunge; I in idea gave up the gho&s;t, thinking all was inevit|ably over, and that there was not a po&s;&s;ibility of life being pre&s;erved; this was momentary. Ea&s;e from pain brings death, and &s;o with me&mdash;It was, I gue&s;s, &s;ome minutes before I recovered from the &s;hock of the fall, or to the lea&s;t ray of re&s;tored &s;en&s;es; but thank God Almighty they did return by degrees, though &s;ickne&s;s was violent, the hor&s;e &s;till lying on my thigh, my head was on the hilly part, and the hor&s;e's feet at the bottom, which kept part of his weight from cru&s;hing my thigh.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="119">
After finding I had &s;o miraculou&s;ly e&s;caped with life, I was fearful, as my right leg and thigh felt &s;o much &s;tunned, that they were broke; but by degrees pulling at the rough hill gently, I got my left foot equal to pu&s;h on the &s;addle, and &s;o relieved my&s;elf, but yet doubted whether I was not in the Ely&s;ian Fields; I was in &s;uch a &s;tate of perturbation and mi&s;ery, with pain, &s;ickne&s;s, and wonder, that it was a delirium. When I was more collected, I looked at the hor&s;e, as he lay almo&s;t lifele&s;s, and by his not making any attempt to move, I feared his limbs had &s;uffered, and that, I &s;uppo&s;ed, would make it an expen&s;ive ride, added to my &s;urgeon's bill. Staying there would not do at any rate, &s;o as &s;oon as I was able to get on my legs I &s;lid to the bottom, took hold of the bridle, and the hor&s;e with great difficulty aro&s;e, and was as patient as a pet lamb: I winded him round and round the rugged place as well and as gently as I could, till by &s;low degrees, aided by that &s;weet maid Patience, I got him out of the dreary depth, and once more attained a part ap|pertaining to Port&s;down Hills. Notwith&s;tanding my third di&s;a&s;ter, I again had courage to mount, being only about two miles from Dr. Garney's, and we proceeded with all the regularity and gravity of Don Quixote to the wi&s;hed-for villa, and arrived at it after all my fatigues, troubles, and hair-breadth
<PB N="120" REF="120">
&s;capes, and falling headlong down th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> deep Tar|peian rock. The Doctor and his &s;on were out, and not expected home till dinner. When I had related the &s;tory of my woes to Mrs. Garney, &s;he was greatly alarmed, and wi&s;hed much for the Doctor's returning, that he might immediately bleed me, which &s;he in&s;i&s;ted was a ceremony ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be in&s;tantly performed. I agreed in opi|nion with her; but as the Doctor's coming might not be for two hours, I retired to be bru&s;hed, wa&s;hed, &amp;c. which was ab&s;olutely needful, and it much refre&s;hed me. I then de&s;ired the favour of a bottle of Madeira, but Mrs. Garney did not ap|prove of it; and, in&s;tead of that potation, recom|mended more hart&s;horn and water; but I told her that I had, on my arrival, been well provided by her kindne&s;s with plenty of the watery element, and now really wi&s;hed for &s;omething el&s;e, and thought Madeira would do wonders: She &s;hook her head on hearing this, and went out of the room. As I was preparing my&s;elf for dinner, &s;he politely &s;ent me the Madeira, and I mo&s;t eagerly drank a full tumbler of it, and it revived me won|derfully; but prudence prevented my increa&s;ing the draught, for by my good will, as I was &s;o thir&s;ty and hot, and the Madeira had gone down &s;o deliciou&s;ly, I could have fini&s;hed the bottle; but well it was I did not, for in my hurried &s;tate
<PB N="121" REF="121">
of &s;pirits, and being brui&s;ed from head to foot, it might have proved a more certain road to death than any dagger I had ever &s;truck, or any draught of poi&s;on I had ever &s;wallowed as a &s;tage patriot for the good of my country.</P>
<P>The Doctor and his &s;on did not return till near four, above two hours after I had arrived on my prancing Bucephalus. I was well refre&s;hed, and my face was in tolerable order, all con&s;idered, though it was much &s;cratched and wounded. Mrs. Garney repre&s;ented my &s;tory in mo&s;t tragical colours; which, had it been &s;o well told before I had drank the Madeira, &s;he might have gained my con&s;ent for being bled, as I expected it after the violent fall I had endured: but on growing better, and think|ing the Madeira had done every thing that was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, all rea&s;ons or per&s;ua&s;ions were in vain, for I ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed, and &s;aid I wi&s;hed for dinner, and that was preferable to being bled. At la&s;t the Doctor's kind intentions yielded to my petu|lance, and the &s;ight of the good dinner &s;eemed to be the mo&s;t prevailing argument on all &s;ides; the lancets were changed for knives and forks, and I performed with tho&s;e weapons more dexterou&s;ly than I or any per&s;on at table expected. We drank Mr. and Mrs. Garrick's health.</P>
<P>The Doctor inquired when my benefit was; I told him:&mdash;He a&s;ked for tickets, which I could not
<PB N="122" REF="122">
have thought of carrying there in my pocket, be|cau&s;e a gentleman had invited me to dinner. However, he begged leave to pre&s;ent me with three guineas for three box tickets, which I was to &s;end him. I accepted the king's pictures, and of cour&s;e &s;ent three &s;craps of paper in exchange. He de|&s;ired I would come once more before I went to London: I accordingly vi&s;ited that plea&s;ant ho&s;|pitable &s;pot again, but it was in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, <HI>not on hor&s;eback.&mdash;No more of that&mdash;no more of that.</HI></P>
<P>On my return the hor&s;e either walked or went a gentle trot all the way to Port&s;mouth, and when in the public road, though &s;everal gentlemen were returning from their evening's ride, he was as ea&s;ily conducted as if he had never been ob&s;trepe|rous. Every one was a&s;toni&s;hed when I related my adventures; and, but that they had a good opinion of my veracity, and &s;eeing the marks on my face, and my naming the waggoners and turn|pike-man as witne&s;&s;es, my &s;tory would not have been credited; for the hor&s;e was &s;o gentle, and &s;o ea&s;ily guided, they &s;aid that every one mu&s;t con|clude the rider was the mo&s;t to blame.</P>
<P>The want of judgment in me might in part have been the cau&s;e; but from the circum&s;tance of the o&s;tler's taking off my &s;purs, it was evident he treated his riders every now and then with a frolic;
<PB N="123" REF="123">
and I gue&s;s his fall had made him feel pain, and find he was in an error when he cut that caper of enchantment which bereft me of my &s;en&s;es; and had he not had that fall I think he would have fini&s;hed my career, and effectually have prevented my ever &s;eeing old Port&s;mouth again.</P>
<P>I do not recollect many particulars relating to this &s;ummer campaign worth &s;etting down, &s;o will &s;uppo&s;e my Port&s;mouth engagement ended, and greatly to my advantage: But now, though not an old man, melancholy reflection tells me, that were I to &s;et my foot in that town, there is not one man or woman, gentleman or gentlewoman exi&s;ting whom I &s;hould know.&mdash;All gone! gone! But why &s;hould I moralize, reflect on, or regret the certain fate of all mankind? Is there a wonder in &s;o well proved a certainty?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Morri&s;on continued at that theatre for &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">me time longer.&mdash;Mr. Moody went for London to his new royal engagement; and Mi&s;s Kitty White was &s;oon after married to her favourite &s;ailor, Mr. Burden. The mother e&s;corted her younge&s;t daughter, Mi&s;s Bet&s;ey, to Dublin; as Mr. Barry, by the per&s;ua&s;ion of Sir Francis Delaval, had engaged her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Kitty was a pupil of Mr. Rich's at the &s;ame time he was <HI>larning</HI> me and &s;he was taught at his academy for acting, and there began our ac|quaintance.
<PB N="124" REF="124">
Mr. Rich took infinite pains in teaching his ladies; Mrs. Stott, late Mrs. Le&s;|&s;ingham, was al&s;o a pupil of his in 1756, and made her appearance in De&s;demona.</P>
<P>I cannot re&s;i&s;t mentioning a little anecdote with which Mrs. Clive and Mr. Garrick were highly entertained; it was related to them by Benjamin Victor, who was at the play on the night it hap|pened at Port&s;mouth, as follows:

</SP></Q></P>
<P>I need not tire the reader by a long &s;tory how happy my mother was to &s;ee her &s;on, after what &s;he thought a tedious ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>On my arrival in London I found Mr. Gar|rick was in town, waited on him, and was re|ceived by my good friend as cordially as when I had la&s;t &s;een him at Port&s;mouth. I had &s;ent him his cloak, for which he poured forth a pro|fu&s;ion of thanks, and &s;aid Mrs. Garrick mu&s;t pay for his Port&s;mouth garment.</P>
<P>At that time I frequently had the honour to
<PB N="125" REF="125">
breakfa&s;t with him; an invitation I would never give or accept but on urgent or very particular occa&s;ions: for give me the news-papers and letters, and let me &s;it &s;ullenly by my&s;elf during that ceremony every day.&mdash;It is to me a &s;trange invitation, and may always be given with &s;afety, for I &s;hould be &s;ure to refu&s;e it. At one of the&s;e breakfa&s;ts Mr. Garrick de&s;ired me to be ready in Bajazet for the annual ceremony at that time of acting Tamer|lane, with the occa&s;ional prologue, at both hou&s;es on the 4th and 5th of November.</P>
<P>Mr. Mo&s;&s;op had been inveigled by Barry and Woodward to their new theatre in Crow-&s;treet, Dublin, which gave a great &s;hock, and made a con&s;iderable cha&s;m and derangement in our affairs of &s;tate.</P>
<P>Mr. King was engaged this year from Dublin, and made his appearance in Tom, in the Con|&s;cious Lovers, in October 1759.</P>
<P>Mr. King had not been there &s;ince the &s;pring 1750, when the Roman Father was brought on the &s;tage, in which he acted Valerius; but Mr. Garrick produced Mr. King to the public in 1748 as the Herald in King Lear, and in the character of George Barnwell in 1749.&mdash;Garrick's judge|ment here was not infallible; and as to Mr. King it is no wonder he &s;hould not have known which way the true bent of his genius lay, as too fre|quently
<PB N="126" REF="126">
is the ca&s;e. Young performers think of nothing but tragedy: I do not doubt but per|&s;everance would have proved Mr. King an acqui|&s;ition to the bu&s;kin, but Mrs. Chance decided otherwi&s;e, and fortunately for the be&s;t.&mdash;In the comedy of the Confederacy he acted Bra&s;s, of which character the inimitable Churchill takes particular notice; and that gentleman, though &s;o keen and clever in his &s;atires, was not &s;trictly ju&s;t, which is rather lamentable where &s;trong and &s;upe|rior genius reigns. Mr. King has proved a contra|diction to his remarks; and, indeed, my very exact explanation relative to my&s;elf, before given, evinces I was not the mimic's mimic; for &s;uch as it was it certainly was my own, which indeed he after|wards acknowledged, as will be mentioned in pro|per time and place.</P>
<P>On reviving the comedy of the Confederacy, Mr. Garrick one evening &s;ent for me in a great hurry to reque&s;t, as a te&s;t of my regard to oblige him, that I would play Old Mrs. Amlet: He &s;aid it &s;truck his thought it might help to &s;trengthen that comedy.&mdash;I in duty bound immediately un|dertook the part.&mdash;Ma&s;s Pope made her fir&s;t ap|pearance as a regular &s;tage candidate in Corinna, though &s;he had often acted as a child in Mi&s;s in her Teens, Lethe, the Oracle, Lilliput, &amp;c.<Q><PB N="127" REF="127"><TEXT>

It was acted again on Monday the 29th of Oc|tober.</P>
<P>The play was greatly received, and Mi&s;s Pope gained much applau&s;e, and gave great promi&s;e of being (what &s;he is univer&s;ally acknowledged to be) an excellent performer; and &s;he has from that night to this day been an ornament to the public as an actre&s;s of their own rearing, and a credit to the &s;tage as a worthy and amiable private character. I mu&s;t not forget to add that my Old Mother Am|let was well received, and for &s;ome nights repeat|ed,
<PB N="128" REF="128">
till the Fates called me unexpectedly from thence.</P>
<P>I well remember, on the &s;econd night of the Confederacy, Mrs. Clive called Mi&s;s Pope into the green room, before her going on the &s;tage as Co|rinna, and &s;aid to her, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Pope," (a &s;weet appellation indeed from Clive) "you played par|ticularly well on Saturday night as a young actre&s;s&mdash;now take from me a piece of advice, which I would have every performer attend to;&mdash;you acted with great and de&s;erved approbation, but to night you mu&s;t endeavour to act better, and expect to receive le&s;s applau&s;e; for if you let your young heart be too &s;anguine, and re&s;t on the ca|price of public commendation or prai&s;e, and find your&s;elf di&s;appointed, you will fooli&s;hly let it damp your &s;pirits, and you will &s;ink beneath your&s;elf;&mdash;therefore take my advice for your proceeding on the &s;tage&mdash; <P>"The violent thunder of applau&s;e la&s;t Saturday on your fir&s;t appearance was not all de&s;erved, it was only benevolently be&s;towed to give you the plea&s;ing information that they were well delighted, and had their warme&s;t wi&s;hes that you would hereafter merit the kindne&s;s they be&s;towed on you."</P></Q> Young performers &s;hould remember this le&s;&s;on, for they are too apt to con&s;true kindne&s;s and che|ri&s;hing into a tribute due to their de&s;erts.</P>

The play of Tamerlane was next called, and a few days before that play came to its annual rota|tion, <HI>Mr. John Moody</HI> made his <HI>entr&eacute;e</HI> in London (as &s;pecified by his articles of war &s;igned at Port&s;|mouth) in the character of King Henry VIII. the night previous to that I acted Mrs. Amlet. Mr. Davies, who was then an actor at Drury-Lane, and who wrote Mr. Garrick's Life, and various other pieces, mi&s;cellanies, &amp;c. was an old man at that time to me, for I was exactly twenty-one that November: This old gentleman had &s;et his heart on acting Bajazet, and when he came one morn|ing to the playhou&s;e and found me rehear&s;ing the part, he was &s;o mortified that he could not con|tain his &s;pleen, but came into the green-room, and with an affected fit of laughter &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ladies and gentlemen, only think what our theatre is come to!&mdash;finely lowered indeed! for we have Henry the Eighth acted by John Moody<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John Moody, the coachman, in the Journey to London.</NOTE>, and Bajazet by an old woman,"</Q> (meaning Mother Amlet.) On hearing which, I very gravely turn|ed round and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"And pray, Mr. Davies, why not Bajazet by <HI>one</HI> old woman as well as <HI>ano|ther?</HI>"</Q> My old woman's retort to Mr. Davies, as the exi&s;ting John Moody can witne&s;s, was my fir&s;t &s;tage wittici&s;m, and which procured an uni|ver&s;al laugh in my favour, be&s;ides that of triumph
<PB N="130" REF="130">
to my friend John Moody and my&s;elf, which I am certain he remembers to this day. The play of Tamerlane was &s;till rehear&s;ing, and being then in favour at court, I was &s;ummoned by Mr. Hol|land into Mr. Garrick's dre&s;&s;ing-room.&mdash;Mr. Garrick &s;aid, he wi&s;hed to hear me repeat &s;ome of Bajazet's &s;peeches, in order to rectify my mi&s;|takes, which would be ea&s;ier to me there than if corrected at rehear&s;al. Mr. Cro&s;s, the prompter, was ordered to attend with the play. Mr. Hol|land, who&s;e part was Mone&s;es, undertook to act the fir&s;t &s;cene as Tamerlane. Mr. Garrick was in high humour, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Well now, Cro&s;s, hey! Why now, this will be too much for my exotic? Hey, Cro&s;s, I mu&s;t do it my&s;elf; what &s;ay you? Hey now! Cro&s;s!" Cro&s;s replied, "I am afraid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ot this year, Sir, as the time is drawing near, and Bajazet is long, and the play mu&s;t be done next Monday." "Well now, hey Cro&s;s! why that is true; but don't you think my brow and eye at Bajazet!&mdash;How do you think I &s;hould play it?" "O! Sir," &s;aid Cro&s;s, "like every thing el&s;e you do&mdash;your Bajazet would be incompa|rable!"&mdash;to which we all bowed and a&s;&s;ented. He then acted a &s;peech or two in my fir&s;t &s;cene, and his look was truly inimitable: "I never &s;hall &s;ee his like again." Now my turn came, as he &s;aid, for a private docking of luxurious branches,
<PB N="131" REF="131">
and here follows the proof of Mr. Garrick's fa|vourite wit, which I formerly mentioned. I went on rehear&s;ing with Holland, my ma&s;ter &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"Very well! va&s;tly well indeed, upon my word!

<P>The delicate reader will &s;kip this leaf, like Sir Clement Flint in the Heire&s;s, yet I hope will par|don it, as I do not in&s;ert it for entertainment, but fairly as the indi&s;pen&s;able characteri&s;tic mirth which Mr. Garrick, with all his under&s;tanding, was too apt to give way to; though one of the fir&s;t ge|niu&s;&s;es of the world, yet he would de&s;cend to &s;uch low &s;tuff and ribaldry. Poets may write, and preachers declaim, yet here is a &s;trong picture that the wi&s;e&s;t people at times are fools. Nature will take the lead in &s;pite of what they call right, and evince them that men are but children of a larger growth; tho&s;e who often teach the contrary laugh
<PB N="132" REF="132">
at you when you believe them, and are &s;ometimes found in equal error with tho&s;e they au&s;terely cor|rect. And it is certainly amazing to the cool re|flector on the human mind, that Garrick, with &s;uch idle &s;tuff, could not only highly divert him&s;elf, but by the help of his kingly name &s;tamp and pa&s;s it as current wit and humour.</P>
<P>I actually aver, that the related &s;trokes of wit from Mr. Garrick's &s;pontaneous and wonderful fancy were retail theatrical jokes for a week or month following; that, on my rehear&s;ing with Mr. Garrick, Mr. Holland judged it &s;o comical, that he had never done with the joke: and &s;o fa&s;hionable was it, that not only the gentlemen, but the ladies, and tho&s;e that were mo&s;t delicate, all profe&s;&s;ed admira|tion and &s;trong appetite for Garrick's je&s;ts on Wil|kin&s;on. Mr. Cadwallader in the Author declares, he eat the prince's &s;oup out of compliment, tho' it was as bitter as gall and as black as his hat&mdash;&s;till &s;ays&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"d&mdash;n his &s;oup."</Q></P>
<P>As a relater of facts, I cannot omit, in regard to Mr. Garrick's amazing care of me as a ma|nager, I was then really ignorant of the art of pro|perly lining my face with Indian ink; he not only gave a particular charge to Mr. John&s;on, the hou&s;e|keeper, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed judgment in tho&s;e matters, but attended in per&s;on by half pa&s;t five, not mere|ly to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;ee that it was done, but corrected
<PB N="133" REF="133">
and gave the fini&s;hing &s;trokes of the pencil him|&s;elf, and helped to improve my face with the ne|ce&s;&s;ary red and white, and the yellow ochre; (but this is letting the reader too far into our &s;tage my|&s;teries;) and certainly &s;uch attention from a per&s;on of his rank and real independence, was careful, plea&s;ing, encouraging, and kind. I thanked him for it.</P>
<P>My Bajazet, upon the word of a gentleman, was better than well received: I was perfect to a <HI>T,</HI> or, as a very old &s;tager would term it, <HI>quite rot|ten in the part.</HI> However, to attempt Bajazet when I was but twenty years old, and fini&s;h it with approbation, certainly gave promi&s;e for the young racer, though no jockey. Mr. Quin had been the Bajazet, and was allowed excellent, and then well remembered.&mdash;Barry was in full fame, and Mo&s;&s;op not forgot in that character; but &s;till there were, at Drury-Lane, only Wilkin&s;on and Davies left at that juncture for Bajazet, Holland being the Mone&s;es.</P>
<P>Mr. Foote at that time had not any engage|ment, and Mr. Garrick really <HI>acted</HI> the being of|fended with him &s;o well, and Mr. Rich kept his <HI>natural</HI> &s;tupidity &s;o ob&s;tinately, that Mr. Foote was reduced from the pre&s;&s;ure of his wants and bad &s;tate of his finances, by way of immediate re|lief to his nece&s;&s;ities, to adverti&s;e a comic lecture
<PB N="134" REF="134">
at the Haymarket theatre early in December. My curio&s;ity naturally prompted me to attend his per|formance; but le&s;t I &s;hould be negligent, Mr. Gar|rick &s;ent for me to rub up my attention, fearing I might like a lazy centinel &s;leep on my po&s;t: He ordered me in &s;trong terms to be there in time, to be very attentive, and to bring him a ju&s;t ac|count.</P>
<P>The lecture was rather defective and lame, but in that whim&s;ical delivery and oratorical &s;ituation Foote was unrivalled, as he had great &s;pirit, judge|ment, fire, and volubility, was very equal and col|lected in a &s;ituation &s;o perilous and difficult. In the fir&s;t act of his oration he evinced all the&s;e &s;hining qualities, but he had not taken lei&s;ure, nor pre|pared him&s;elf by any means with &s;ufficient matter for &s;uch a night's entertainment as was expected, and all to be done by him&s;elf.<Q><L>It was too ra&s;h, too unadvis'd, and</L>

<P>It may be difficult, without doubt, to &s;u&s;tain and ri&s;e &s;uperior in the fifth act, but that it is to be achieved is unan&s;werably proved, whenever the Provoked Hu&s;band, the Beaux Stratagem, the Su&s;|picious Hu&s;band, and the Wonder are acted: In laughter, glee, and &s;pirit, they ri&s;e evidently to the la&s;t.

So the &s;econd part of Mr. Foote's lecture was like a bad fifth act in a play: he was exhau&s;ted, and felt but little of his former &s;elf; he &s;eemed to have no re&s;ource, and was reduced to beg leave to &s;it down at a table with two candles, and read his new piece called the Minor, which he then wanted to bring on the &s;tage, and that was in a mutilated, unprepared &s;tate; even for the clo&s;et it was almo&s;t incomprehen&s;ible, and, as it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;uffered much by being read to &s;uch di&s;|advantage; though inforced by Mr. Foote, yet it was very languid to a large audience.</P>
<P>He &s;oon found the forced experiment weighed as heavy on him&s;elf as on his hearers, he there|fore broke up the a&s;&s;embled court rather abruptly, apologized for the hurry with which he had taken
<PB N="138" REF="138">
the liberty to convene them together, and fini&s;h|ed with an a&s;&s;urance of making con&s;iderable alte|rations and additions again&s;t the next e&s;&s;ay, of which he would give timely notice.&mdash;He bowed and departed, neither with tokens of approbation or di&s;gu&s;t, for each party &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the relea&s;e.&mdash;The audience retired apparently con|tented with &s;uch fare as they had partaken of, but not by any means wi&s;hing to &s;it down again to the &s;ame di&s;h.</P>
<P>Mr. Foote mu&s;t have been perfectly convinced of this, for he never again offered to try their pa|lates, fearing, I &s;uppo&s;e, it would not have &s;uited their ta&s;tes, but have been ordered away with to|kens of di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>When the lecture was over I po&s;ted to the theatre, and as full of my pacquet of news as poor Scrub, eagerly got to Mr. Garrick's room, where he was waiting, all impatience, and Colonel Kep|pel with him, both in full dre&s;s, it having been a gala day at St. James's, where they had been pay|ing their re&s;pects.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay &s;everal country readers will doubt my authenticity, when I mention Mr. Garrick's having been at Court; but they may depend upon it that the information to tho&s;e who live in Lon|don would not cau&s;e any wonder, or be a matter

of the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, as the patentees of Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden, not only go publicly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o Court at St. James's, but if they were to ne|glect that ceremony, at lea&s;t occa&s;ionally, as on birth-days, &amp;c. it would be taken notice of, judged a remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, and not re&s;pectful. Mr. Foote, as patentee at the Hay-Market, always went to Court, where the fir&s;t nobility were as glad to &s;ee him as any other acquaintance or intimate friend.</P>
<P>I not ob&s;erving Mr. Garrick to be &s;o fully equipped with <HI>chapeau bras</HI> under his arm, and Colonel Keppel the &s;ame, my thoughts were car|ried from their proper channel, and I entered the apartment &s;o precipitately, and was &s;o eager like a po&s;t-me&s;&s;enger to deliver my credentials, that I forgot to take off my hat, but let it remain like a &s;tubborn proud quaker, on its right place, the head. This was not from a rude habit, quite the con|trary; but in my hurry and ardent de&s;ire to prove my loyal zeal to king David, I had really never thought of it. Mr. Garrick very kindly gave me a wink and a &s;light pull, and pointed at my head; I was quickly &s;en&s;ible of my error and apologized for it, which Colonel Keppel laughed at very heartily, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He was &s;ure it was from a hurry of &s;pirits;"</Q> then &s;at down as eager as Gar|rick to hear the news relative to Foote's lecture;
<PB N="140" REF="140">
for he was a &s;incere friend of Garrick's&mdash;to Foote of cour&s;e the contrary. After an hour's conver|&s;ation, with &s;ome of Garrick's &s;tories, and his damning Foote very heartily, we parted. In two or three days after, I was &s;ummoned to a cabinet council in Southampton-Street: I found Foote's abu&s;e in his lecture had not dige&s;ted, but &s;at very heavy on my manager's proud &s;tomach. Mr. Gar|rick &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He had ju&s;t received certain informa|tion, that the d&mdash;d fellow Foote was engaged with Barry and Woodward, for Dublin, and had ac|tually &s;et forward that very day."&mdash;"Now," &s;ays Garrick, "My dear Tate, now you &s;ee I have &s;uch a regard for you, that I cannot omit any op|portunity of doing you a &s;ervice.

<P>This propo&s;al I reli&s;hed as much as Mr. Gar|rick wi&s;hed. I promi&s;ed to be guided as he de|&s;ired:

I was quite elated with the &s;cheme, and was all alive, and in tip top &s;pirits at the thoughts of &s;eeing dear Dublin again, and all my good friends there. I returned Mr. Garrick a thou&s;and thanks for his gracious furlough.</P>
<P>I took that opportunity of a&s;king for the money for his Port&s;mouth cloak, which, notwith&s;tanding the honour of often breakfa&s;ting with him, I had not yet received, though the &s;um was not enor|mous, being only three guineas: it was elegantly made for the price; and he frequently walked the theatrical deck of his royal man of war graced in that &s;nug covering. <Q REND="inline">"But, now, well," &s;aid he, "I &s;uppo&s;e you think now&mdash;hey, that you are ne|ver to be paid for this d&mdash;d cloak;" which was in fact expecting I &s;hould have replied with, "My good Sir, your kindne&s;s is &s;uch, that I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf highly honoured by your accept|ance of &s;uch a trifling pre&s;ent."</Q> But I knew my man too well, and was certain that his good breed|ing would not have put me to the trouble of a &s;e|cond offer; for without more ceremony he would have accepted of it.

<P>I informed my lady mother of my unexpected trip, &s;he did not like the thoughts of the &s;ea for her wi&s;e &s;on; but tru&s;ting, as &s;he ever did, to the &s;ole Guider of all things, &s;he mu&s;tered a re&s;olution, and prepared for my journey and voyage, as I was obliged to go in four or five days.</P>
<P>On the night I was to depart in the Che&s;ter fly, having had a porter to cord my boxes before I went to the play, on my return to take leave of my mother and not to depart without the good ble&s;&s;ing, to my &s;urpri&s;e I had locked up all my ca&s;h in the boxes, and had not near &s;ufficient in my pocket to reach Dublin: I did not wi&s;h to un|pack my mail-trunk till I had got to Holy-Head, where the officers of the cu&s;tom would per force view and feel the contents.

He feared, on &s;eeing me that &s;ome mis|fortune had happened: I got but ju&s;t in time to &s;ave my di&s;tance, for he was in his night-cap, and &s;aid, in about fifteen minutes he &s;hould have been in bed. I told him the accident, and &s;aid I &s;hould really be much obliged to him for fifteen guineas, which he declared he was glad I wanted, as it gave him an opportunity to prove how will|ing he was to oblige me, and actually would not let me by any means take le&s;s than twenty: and, if in drawing an exact copy, as far as I can judge of the human heart, I do believe I was welcome to the &s;um in the humour he was then in, even had he never received it again. When I repre&s;ent a picture of oddities annexed to genius, do not let me ungenerou&s;ly not feel and declare how well he here be&s;towed; and I dare aver with &s;incerity; he at times did generous actions, and liked they &s;hould be known. But our minds are wavering in common life, and when we con&s;ider the more his a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;cernment de&s;cried and proved the difficulties he had to &s;urmount, no wonder it in &s;ome degree &s;poiled perhaps a good mind, had he been placed in any other &s;ituation; veracity demands this complimentary truth to his memory.</P>

This was to me a happy landing; and as I was going in a hackney coach to my lodgings, I thought I recollected the figure of a lady I knew, and on &s;topping the car|riage, who &s;hould it be but my dear Mrs. White, who was come over with her younge&s;t daughter, &s;i&s;ter to the Mi&s;s Kitty White who was with me at Port&s;mouth.</P>

<P>To &s;hew how ea&s;ily Mr. Garrick would let trifles vex him, he u&s;ed frequently to corre&s;pond with a Mr. Swan of York; who, like Mr. Rich, thought him&s;elf the only reader or judge of Shak|&s;peare's Othello: he had been an actor, and acting manager many years before in Dublin; but not remembered as Mr. Victor ob&s;erves: for the Dub|lin &s;tage being in &s;uch dreadful order till after the year 1740, when Mr. Sheridan (&s;on of Dr. She|ridan, and father to our pre&s;ent &s;hining ornament, of the Engli&s;h &s;enate and the Engli&s;h &s;tage) be|came the undaunted reformer of every flagrant

abu&s;e. Mr. Swan, after having at York taught Mr. Jack&s;on, now the Edinburgh manager, how to undraw the curtain in his favourite balcony &s;cene, (never acted but by his direction) &s;aid to a gentleman of the theatre, now in York in a very re&s;pectable &s;ituation&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No man under&s;tands Othello but my&s;elf."&mdash;"No!" &s;ays the gentleman&mdash;"What do you think of Mr. Garrick?"&mdash;"O! by G&mdash;d the man is not adequate to it&mdash;for he has neither learning nor under&s;tanding equal to the ta&s;k."</Q> This fooli&s;h trifling circum&s;tance was repeated to Mr. Moody; who, when in Lon|don, &s;eeing Mr. Swan's letters to Mr. Garrick, wherein he paid great adulation to his judgment, told the ridiculous circum&s;tance, as a proof of that gentleman's duplicity. Mr. Garrick after that received &s;everal letters from Mr. Swan, but never an&s;wered one.</P>
<P>On the evening of my arrival in Dublin, Decem|ber 26, 1759, I had a me&s;&s;age from Mr. Brown, the manager of Smock-alley theatre, with an in|vitation to &s;upper: We &s;oon agreed, for he did not know I was bound not to act at the other theatre, &s;o all I a&s;ked was granted, and prelimina|ries were &s;ettled with the utmo&s;t harmony, and the night fixed for my fir&s;t mounting the &s;tage. But before I enter on the circum&s;tances attending my own &s;kill on this adventure, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="153" REF="153">
an hi&s;torian, to inform the reader re&s;pecting many alterations that had occurred in the meridian of Dublin &s;ince my fir&s;t attempt on that &s;tage, in December 1757, and what I am now to men|tion was in January, 1760. All, or mo&s;t of my theatrical readers, have doubtle&s;s been informed of the &s;tate of the Dublin theatres, from books, relators, or experience; but a &s;hort information for &s;trangers to tho&s;e points in general is, I think, in &s;ome degree here nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>When I acted with Mr. Foote, in 1757, the expences were on a narrow &s;cale, but on a more &s;olid and &s;ecure foundation than in 1760; or I fear than at pre&s;ent, 1790. Indeed, in this year, the theatre is honoured with a patent; yet like the expen&s;ive cones of Cherburgh, I fear the pro|fit is &s;till far back, many &s;torms a&s;&s;ault, and &s;ome|times in want of regular &s;upplies; the garri&s;on not loyal, and the in&s;ide of the <HI>genii</HI> palace very melancholy; not all well within, though adorned with fal&s;e glare and enterpri&s;e. Indeed, to keep a Dublin or a York theatre, and gain the attention of a fickle audience, greedy for variety, and &s;oon &s;atiated, mu&s;t be attended with expence and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">atigue of mind, beyond the po&s;&s;ible idea of an auditor; and though great receipts do at particu|lar times happen, yet the very ill &s;ucce&s;s that drags on for want of ability, before the &s;udden
<PB N="154" REF="154">
&s;pring tide &s;ets the crazy ve&s;&s;el afloat, makes the Captain Manager too well acquainted with that hard labour the vulgar term&mdash;<HI>working for a dead hor&s;e.</HI>&mdash;I am &s;ure I can tell the Dublin manager I &s;peak this feelingly, but not as an agreeable <HI>truth;</HI> and if I am wrong in my &s;uppo&s;ition of him, I beg his pardon, and wi&s;h him joy of his arduous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Now Mr. Sheridan in 1757 was the manage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a good theatre, with decent wardrobe, &s;cenery, &amp;c.&mdash;His plays acted with exactne&s;s, propriety, and regularity, and with every nece&s;&s;ary embel|li&s;hment.</P>

<P>Mr. Sheridan then did not gain any enormous &s;um, though he was in univer&s;al e&s;teem, and be|loved as a gentleman, and an actor of great abi|lity. At times he had very beneficial &s;ea&s;ons. His charge for a benefit was only 40l.&mdash;Now, on my arrival in 1760, Mr. Barry's charges were with
<PB N="155" REF="155">
difficulty, and I believe lo&s;s, continued at 60l. Mr. Barry and Mr. Woodward, by rai&s;ing a &s;ub|&s;cription, had a new, exten&s;ive, and more elegant theatre; and new brooms &s;weep clean. They opened that theatre in October, 1758; but it was loaded with not le&s;s than &s;ixty &s;ub&s;cribers tickets. When Woodward and Barry fir&s;t acted, great &s;ums were received, but it was but the vi&s;ion of an hour; for the number of auditors were con|fined when compared to tho&s;e of London, and as John Moody &s;ays, <HI>they could not haud it, they could not haud it.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan that year, after endeavouring to rally forces, and make way again&s;t the &s;tream of Fa&s;hion, found the current too &s;trong, was oblig|ed to quit his &s;hip, as the old crazy theatrical ve&s;&s;el threatened in&s;tant &s;inking, and from the ruins of which the very rats had run; he found him&s;elf de&s;erted by Mr. King and Mrs. Fitzhenry, who went over to the foe: &s;o he took the fir&s;t op|portunity of a fair wind and retreated, not deem|ing him&s;elf&mdash;<Q><L>Arm'd with &s;elf-&s;ufficient merit</L>

But he who is in battle &s;lain,</L>
<L>Will never ri&s;e to fight again.</L></Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t year &s;eemed to promi&s;e Barry and Woodward &s;ucce&s;s. To Barry it was not &s;o mate|rial being in debt, for that never di&s;turbed his re&s;t. Woodward's di&s;po&s;ition was quite the contrary, for his dinner, good or bad, would not dige&s;t unle&s;s he was certain it was paid for.&mdash;He was an oeco|nomi&s;t in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word&mdash;He had &s;ecured a little fortune quite &s;ufficient for that en|viable &s;tate, <HI>independency;</HI> his income at Drury-Lane having been affluent with great benefits for &s;everal years, and a darling of the public from boxes to the galleries. But with a grand view for gain, he unfortunately experienced a total change. He had quitted luxury, riches, and ea&s;e, and was playing in Dublin with vexation, danger, and &s;lavery, in a comparative view, and one mi&s;hap after another in perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The nights when Barry and Woodward did not act the hou&s;es were &s;o bad as to cau&s;e a woeful draw|back.</P>
<P>Crow-&s;treet &s;eemed on the fir&s;t on&s;et to promi&s;e well; but Barry was him&s;elf a very luxurious Marc Antony to &s;upport; and the other hou&s;e in Smock-alley, though contemptible in a compa|rative view, yet was often galling, and pricked the
<PB N="157" REF="157">
&s;ides of royalty; for Barry and Woodward were appointed ma&s;ters of the Revels, which gave them the power of dubbing their new hou&s;e <HI>royal;</HI> but the Lord Mayor at that time had the power to licence what theatres he judged proper; yet Woodward found it impo&s;&s;ible, and a more difficult ta&s;k than he imagined, to cru&s;h what he at fir&s;t looked on as a very contemptible, weak ene|my; yet weak and malicious enemies can &s;ome|times pour in &s;trength, and often create unea&s;ine&s;s and perplexity.</P>
<P>The revival of Douglas at the old hou&s;e, by Mr. Digges and Mrs. Ward&mdash;al&s;o getting plays occa&s;ionally be&s;poke&mdash;benefits artfully given to public charities, and well-known genteel families in di&s;tre&s;s, but above all beginning their principal benefits in the height of the &s;ea&s;on again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t plays of their opponents, certainly greatly hurt their con&s;equence, de&s;troyed Woodward's re&s;t, and lowered Barry's fame, which &s;tood aloft, and looked di&s;dain and terror on the ho&s;t of &s;cat|tered &s;carecrows beneath him; yet the&s;e inevitable &s;trokes could not be parried.</P>
<P>But on &s;ome of tho&s;e nights, when Barry, Woodward, Mrs. Fitzhenry, and Mrs. Dancer, did all unite, with an excellent company, and ex|erted their be&s;t abilities, have they performed to a middling hou&s;e; while the other has had a full
<PB N="158" REF="158">
theatre, on &s;ome popular occa&s;ion, to an ill-acted play, with dirty clothes and &s;cenes, and a di&s;mally bad-lighted theatre.&mdash;Indeed I have known even in London, when Mr. Rich has revived an old pantomime tagged to a vile-acted play, that Gar|rick has trembled; and I have heard him remark, that if they came to a tragedy at Drury-Lane from want of admittance by an overflow of Co|vent-Garden, they were not in humour the whole night, as the grown ma&s;ters and mi&s;&s;es were di&s;|appointed of &s;eeing the puppet-&s;hew, and were deprived of their rattle.&mdash;I mu&s;t mention all that incredible rage for pantomime in London is now, to the credit of the audience, no more, but it comes in very properly as a relief;&mdash;but thirty-five years ago, to Harlequin Socerer, the doors were obliged to be opened at three o'clock, and were at times broke open, &s;o eager were the million for admit|tance.</P>
<P>In the Dublin &s;truggle, Barry and Woodward met with inconceivable and unfor&s;een perplexities; they had recour&s;e to their powerful &s;et of friends, particularly to ladies of quality, to add their names to their &s;trong plays, which had certainly irre&s;i&s;tible charms: but this could not always la&s;t; however that, and then beginning their own benefits gave a total overthrow to the enemy, who were &s;o tattered and &s;o mean in their attire, that <Q REND="inline">"their executors

Barry and Woodward clo&s;ed early in June 1759, opened again in October, and thought Dublin their own; but November had not elap&s;ed before they had authentic intelligence that an army lay concealed: But as they were poor do not think the army in di&s;gui&s;e were as lucky as Mr. Bayes's, where we are informed all the innkeepers were their friends. Indeed Barry and Woodward this year were, by wi&s;hing to do too much, the cau&s;e of their own de&s;truction: they had offered Mo&s;&s;op, as I have related, great terms, and bribed him from Drury-Lane; and here they certainly were wrong, for Mo&s;&s;op would never have left the fir&s;t &s;ituation in Drury-Lane on any chance (or even certainty) and join a banditti, to perform in a theatre &s;o de&s;titute of every article whatever, to have oppo&s;ed their hand&s;ome well-provided theatre in all points. However they had him there. Mr. Mo&s;&s;op being bred a gentleman, al&s;o the &s;on of one, and having had a Dublin college education, he was univer&s;ally known and
<PB N="160" REF="160">
in high e&s;teem, and was then thought by every one prudent and of an economical turn, but lived very genteelly: It was difficult to decide that &s;ea|&s;on which was the greate&s;t favourite with the la|dies as a tragedian, Barry or Mo&s;&s;op; which was &s;trange, as Barry was not only far &s;uperior, pro|fe&s;&s;ionally, but was the only actor for really ma|king love I ever &s;aw; but Mo&s;&s;op added to much &s;terling merit and the firmne&s;s of voice for &s;trength and clearne&s;s, that double attraction, novelty. But the audience unfortunately will not always judge as the players do, but a&s;&s;ert their undoubted right of plea&s;ing them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I &s;hould like audiences to approve as I wi&s;hed them, and believe there are other managers would like, &s;eriou&s;ly &s;peaking, the &s;ame; and yet, in a ge|neral view, unle&s;s on riotous doings, Garrick had a wonde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ful power of that kind over his hearers, as they mo&s;tly held him invaluable, and put great faith in what he recommended to their &s;anction and good opinion.</P>

<P>Now the reader, if not theatrical, will better under&s;tand what I had to encounter on my arrival. Mr Brown was the de&s;perate manager of Smock|alley theatre; he had been in much e&s;teem as an actor and a gentleman at Bath and Edinburgh&mdash;once attempted Richard at Drury-Lane, but was barely permitted to fini&s;h the part&mdash;He had been in the army, and was well known by mo&s;t of the officers; was a mo&s;t plea&s;ing well-behaved com|panion, was very indolent, a &s;econd Digges for ex|travagance, was much in debt in England and in Dublin, and it was very immaterial to him if he failed as manager, for he could not be poorer; and though it might put a &s;top to more credit, he was &s;o well beloved they never pre&s;&s;ed him to any di&s;tre&s;s, for as they knew money he had not, to lock him up was inflicting cruelty that could not an&s;wer any good purpo&s;e. His Copper Captain was &s;o much approved that it always brought money; Woodward's was thought very in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">erior, nor could he keep that play on a par again&s;t Brown, with all the &s;triking advantages his theatre and company po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed:&mdash;Our theatre was, as before
<PB REF="162">
de&s;cribed, and looked like a dungeon. Mrs. Abington (who was then of no note) had, three or four years before that November, played a few parts at Bath, (when Mr. Brown was ma|nager) al&s;o at Richmond, and &s;ome chance plays with Theophilus Cibber in the &s;ummer, by per|mi&s;&s;ion of the Lord Chamberlain, in the Hay|market, and had been engaged in 1759 at Drury-Lane at thirty &s;hillings per week. Mrs. Abing|ton had performed Dorcas in the Mock Doctor, &amp;c. but Mr. Garrick not perceiving her merit, or in fear that encouragement would be for claiming advancement of terms, did not &s;eem inclined to introduce that lady to advantage before the pub|lic:&mdash;But my then intimate friend, Mrs. Abing|ton, formed a better opinion of her own de&s;erts, and thinking Mr. Garrick intended injury, in&s;tead of acting friendly, &s;he, without ceremony, &s;ud|denly eloped in December to her former ma|nager and old acquaintance Mr. Brown, who had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ired Smock-alley theatre at a trifling rent of Dr. Wil&s;on: He had wrote to her on his new acquired honours, and a&s;&s;ured her of the choice of every leading character whatever, if &s;he would quit her then indifferent Drury-Lane engagement. Mrs. Abington had arrived about fourteen days before me, and had acted with good and gracious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eception; but not having the London &s;tamp of
<PB N="163" REF="163">
con&s;equence, was only &s;poke of as really a very clever woman. My terms were &s;ettled at &s;hares after 20l. and a clear benefit, with three weeks notice whenever I &s;hould choo&s;e to ap|point my night. Mr. Garrick, in his act of grace, had left me what is termed a creep|hole out of the act of parliament; for he had not de&s;ired me to make it a provincial attack in what was then termed my way, by ridiculing Barry, Mo&s;&s;op, Woodward, &amp;c. being a&s;&s;ured my eager|ne&s;s to do it was &s;ufficient; but here he was mi&s;|taken, for under &s;o good a theatrical guide as him|&s;elf, I mu&s;t have been a &s;tupid hound indeed not to have learned in&s;tinctively a &s;mall portion of &s;agacity; and he did not doubt but I &s;hould be led by natural error into an eagerne&s;s for the &s;port, without my paying any attention to the being right or wrong: but I had, with a little maturity, attained &s;ome experience and ob&s;ervation; and on ruminating on what had, and what might hap|pen, and not by any means approving my Drury-Lane engagement, nor relying too much on a great man's promi&s;e, and doubting of terms to plea&s;e me for the following year, the &s;eeds of re|bellion were &s;cattered in my heart and promi&s;ed growth.&mdash;It pre&s;ently on reflection convinced me, if I made the managers of Crow-&s;treet my ene|mies, I was not only acting as a fool, but al&s;o as a
<PB N="164" REF="164">
tool to accompli&s;h Mr. Garrick's purpo&s;es, which would throw me back entirely into his power, as I &s;hould exclude my&s;elf by &s;o doing from all re|&s;ource in the capital theatres; and though I felt and glowed as the Alexander and the Lear of Port&s;mouth, &s;till my connections and attachments to the great world made me only reli&s;h country retreats by way of relaxation, and as a man of con&s;equence appertaining to the royal theatres, not as a con&s;tant re&s;ident of a provincial community: Therefore, if by attempting to appear with great eclat, I quitted all hopes of the &s;ub&s;tance by pre|ferring the &s;hadow, it would put an effectual bar to all my &s;elf-flattering hopes of future pro&s;perity, and by plea&s;ing two or three audiences might create a bundle of bitter, la&s;ting, and implacable enemies; yet while I pre&s;erved my engagement for the winter of any con&s;equence as a public cha|racter in either London or Dublin, it was &s;ecurity for a good profitable reception for the &s;ummer in the country, either in England or Ireland.</P>
<P>It &s;o happened I was the fir&s;t who had explored from London into the depths of country play|hou&s;es; in con&s;equence the &s;ucce&s;s was much more &s;ecure, profitable, and blazing, than it would be in the pre&s;ent times: as now every principal actor and actre&s;s's merit is as well under&s;tood and declaim|ed upon at the <HI>Half Moon</HI> or any other public|hou&s;e,
<PB N="165" REF="165">
as if one of their own breed; almo&s;t every theatrical &s;tar having deigned to &s;hine in all the principal theatres in the three kingdoms.</P>
<P>Now, in point of imitation, Mr. Foote was fair game, and allowed to be &s;o even by the good com|pany he was then engaged with at Crow-&s;treet.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t appearance at Smock-alley that year was on Friday, January 4, 1760&mdash;Much Ado about Nothing&mdash;Benedick, Mr. Brown; Beatrice, Mrs. Abington.&mdash;With (never acted in this kingdom) The Diver&s;ions of the Morning; which I acted at Drury-Lane the &s;ea&s;on before for my own bene|fit.&mdash;Foote brought out a piece again&s;t me, which luckily failed?&mdash;He acted Lady Pentweazle in the fir&s;t act as I did; in the &s;econd act he expected to do a great deal with his Tragedy A-la-Modo, but not having any per&s;on to relieve him, and try|ing the pa&s;te-board figures, it was with difficulty that part was &s;uffered to fini&s;h: though after that time it did great matters at the Haymarket; but never &s;o well as when we acted it together&mdash;he the author, and my&s;elf, dre&s;&s;ed as the tragedy actor, was Golcondas the hero.

coincided &s;o nearly with my own, they were not har&s;h or unpalatable to me.</P>
<P>Mr. Chaigneau was a &s;ub&s;criber to Crow-&s;treet theatre, and had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf unea&s;y on the &s;ubject: I rather &s;u&s;pect he was the in&s;tigator of this vi&s;it. I promi&s;ed Mr. Coates to acquie&s;ce; gave my compliments to Mr. Barry, and that he might depend on his reque&s;t being complied with. The day after my appearance, Mr. Barry &s;ent me a &s;hort letter of congratulation on the good recep|tion he had heard I was favoured with the night before, and de&s;ired, when my benefit was, that I would in&s;tantly inform him, and inclo&s;e ten box tickets. Al&s;o the high breathing Mr. Mo&s;&s;op called, wondering, as we had both been at Drury-Lane the winter before, that I had not, &s;oon after my arrival, been to &s;ee him and left a card of direc|tion to Henry-court, Dame-&s;treet. He affected great ea&s;e and gaiety, neither of which &s;at ea&s;y; though a proud well-behaved man, he hoped we &s;hould be on friendly terms while I continued in Ireland. He did not expre&s;s one &s;yllable relative either to mimicry or what I had done, or intended to do, at Smock-alley theatre. On his departure he rung the bell for a pen and ink, and begged permi&s;&s;ion to leave a note of remembrance for &s;ix box tickets on my benefit night. I occa&s;ionally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> on Mr. Mo&s;&s;op in Henry-court, &s;o we both

kept up the appearance of civility; but I was not &s;uch a novice not to well know (like Polly in the Beggar's Opera) that all this wheedling was not for nothing; and had he a&s;ked me to have drank, like Mi&s;s Peachum, I &s;hould not have poured any of his &s;trong waters down my throat.</P>
<P>When the benefit came I &s;ent the tickets&mdash;Mr. Mo&s;&s;op called in a few days and pre&s;ented me with three guineas for his debt of honour:&mdash;Mr. Barry I called on, and &s;ent to, but never got admittance. When my departure grew near, I really was ur|gent, and de&s;ired Mr. Mo&s;&s;op to mention it to him&mdash;he did one night, while he was acting Lear; he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age after the play to &s;ee me the next noon; (I had touched his pride; if I had not, do not think I &s;hould have touched the ca&s;h). I did not omit being punctual;&mdash;he met me with all tho&s;e winning &s;miles and graces, for which he had few competitors on or off the &s;tage. After many excu&s;es, and rejoicing at my &s;ucce&s;s, he pre|&s;ented me with five guineas, and apologized for begging my acceptance of &s;uch a <HI>bagatelle.</HI>&mdash;I a&s;|&s;ured him I was fully &s;atisfied; he a&s;ked me to dinner with all the appearance of &s;incerity, but I think I can pronounce he was better plea&s;ed, and more &s;incere, when it came to the &s;hort phra&s;e of, <HI>I wi&s;h you a good day, Mr. Wilkin&s;on.</HI> As he had
<PB N="171" REF="171">
made the parade, I certainly was right to expect to be paid for my ten box tickets.</P>
<P>Barry, without doubt, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the art of plea|&s;ing per&s;ua&s;ion beyond any man I ever &s;aw: So thought the late Mr. Pelham. He was bewitch|ing to hear, and dangerous to believe.</P>
<P>Previous to this account I &s;hould have men|tioned, the &s;econd night of my performance was on Monday, January 7, The Merchant of Venice; Shylock, Mr. Brown; Portia, Mrs. Abington; and Diver&s;ions of the Morning.

<P>My not interfering with the peculiarities of the gentlemen of Crow-&s;treet theatre (of which every one, more or le&s;s, had his &s;hare) certainly made me friends, and al&s;o rendered my time more ea&s;y and quiet.

that my fair and lucky days I attribute to the genial &s;oil of Old Ireland; my unlucky ones, but too often, I &s;et down to my own account, with that mixture of vexation which lifts the ingredi|ents of the poi&s;oned chalice to my own lips.

<P>I acted, be&s;ides the Diver&s;ions of the Morning, that &s;ea&s;on, 1760, King Lear; Zamti, in the Orphan of China, repeatedly; Mrs. Amlet, &amp;c.

<P>Mr. Foote's benefit at Crow-&s;treet, was on Tue&s;day, February 11th.

The weather on my benefit night was dread|ful indeed, every combination of deep &s;now, &s;torm, &amp;c. Notwith&s;tanding the theatre over|flowed from every part, and almo&s;t as &s;oon as the doors were opened even the orche&s;tra was filled with gentlemen who got over; the greate&s;t part of the pit was laid into the boxes.&mdash;At Crow-&s;treet, they acted Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure.&mdash;Duke, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op; Lucio, Mr. Woodward; I&s;abella, Mrs. Fitzhenry, with Fortunatus, above 120l.&mdash;A Mi&s;s M'Neale had a good Concert, and there were debates that night in the Hou&s;e of Commons. The receipt of my hou&s;e was 172l. the greate&s;t ever known at that time in that theatre. I mention this dreadful night as to weather, though a good blowing wind to me, not by any means to denote my con&s;equence, but to have the reader note, what Dublin on a night of tempe&s;t and &s;treets covered with &s;now could do, even at that time, when inclination prompted; as not my hou&s;e only, but each place I have men|tioned was well attended, though Dublin was not by a full third, I have rea&s;on to believe, what it is now, and a city growing not only more populous, but what is as good increa&s;ing in trade, opulence, and &s;plendour. The eagerne&s;s for admittance was &s;o extraordinary, that another night was de&s;ired for my advantage, and Mr. Brown, the manager,
<PB N="174" REF="174">
complied on condition of &s;haring after 30l. which I agreed to. I had 60 l. on Thur&s;day, Feb. 21, in what is there termed out&s;tanding tickets. My benefit this year in point of profit, be&s;ides the re|ceipt being better, was far &s;uperior to my fir&s;t bene|fit there in 1758. A very particular circum&s;tance occa&s;ioned this, which honour and ju&s;tice calls on me to explain.</P>
<P>The farce (as by bill) was <HI>High Life below Stairs.</HI> before my benefit happened Mr. Foote (who of all men in the world ought not to have been of|fended) found him&s;elf much hurt and wounded, and &s;o little ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, that notwith&s;tand|ing the unbounded liberties he had taken not only with the players, but al&s;o often to the di&s;turbance of the peace of private families, as Mr. Langford, Mr Aprice, Duche&s;s of King&s;ton, and various other per&s;ons might ri&s;e up at three different &s;tage trap doors, like Richard's Gho&s;ts, to declare and &s;wear.

We often met drawn up at noon in different parties in the Tri|nity-College

Gardens as perfect &s;trangers, but never at any hou&s;e of vi&s;iting; if we had, his talent of wit would have forced me to have felt the &s;e|verity of his la&s;h.

<P>Indeed the only in&s;tance of true good humour and plea&s;antry, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, was afforded to me by my old acquaintance, the late Mr. Hol|land, when he returned from his Liverpool &s;um|mer excur&s;ion to London, early in September 1764, preparatory to the opening of Drury-Lane theatre, which was bordering on the clo&s;e of the theatrical Hay-Market campaign: He was in the boxes at the repre&s;entation of Tragedy A-la-Mode, where he was a vi&s;ible witne&s;s to my &s;imilitude of his voice, manner, and mode of expre&s;&s;ion; he al&s;o perceived and felt the

uncommon applau&s;e that honoured my perform|ance; he was him&s;elf at the in&s;tant convinced of the likene&s;s. After the performance he &s;upped at Mr. Foote's, and the never forgotten <HI>Chace Price,</HI> jokingly and provokingly a&s;ked Holland, How he admired him&s;elf in the Mu&s;e's looking gla&s;s that Mr. Wilkin&s;on had that night &s;hewn him?

Except that vi&s;it from Mr. Foote, with Mr. Kennedy in Dublin, we had never &s;poke from his refu&s;al to play for me at Drury-Lane, in the &s;pring 1759, which cruel refu&s;al as I then judged it, turned out a mo&s;t fortunate though unfore&s;een occurrence to me.</P>
<P>The managers of Crow-&s;treet had to boa&s;t of the excellent performance of their plays; the novelty of Woodward's pantomimes, got up at a

It was often acted before Mrs. Abington's departure and mine for Ire|land, &s;o we were both perfect in all the minutiae of the farce, or what we term the <HI>&s;tage bu&s;ine&s;s;</HI> very material points in getting up a piece with correctne&s;s. Each character was within the com|pa&s;s of our little troop&mdash;one and all with very little attention and care to appear to advantage; be&s;ides having the great addition of originality, it was well drawn for the compa&s;s of middling abilities to comprehend and execute: &s;o that, take it for all in all, High Life below Stairs was a &s;trong chance of good novelty, and was attended with very little extraordinary expence, which was another convenience to our manager, as he was to pay for what I revived or produced for my

nights' entertainments.&mdash;No compari&s;on could be drawn to our di&s;advantage&mdash;another favourable point.&mdash;Mrs. Abington approved of my thought for that farce, and &s;he not only con&s;ented, but &s;eemed plea&s;ed with Mrs. Kitty; and though &s;he had played &s;everal leading characters, yet our re|ceipts only ran from 20l. to 25l. and at be&s;t 40l. in general, one night with the other.

<P>The &s;ame farce was repeated the week follow|ing, with the Orphan of China, Feb. 21; Zamti, Mr. Wilkin&s;on, which I had before acted, and had been well received in the character.&mdash;The Crow-&s;treet managers adverti&s;ed again&s;t it, that they had dre&s;&s;es preparing in London which were to be &s;ent over, and intimating Mr. Mur|phy, the author, would follow to &s;ee it rehear&s;ed; to which Mr. Brown replied in the following pa|ragraph:</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="181">
<Q REND="inline">"The Orphan of China, being a tragedy not any way difficult or my&s;terious to tho&s;e who do not require to be parroted in their parts, we can a&s;&s;ure the public that it is now in perfect readi|ne&s;s, and will be performed this evening at the theatre in Smock-alley, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the author: For as plays are &s;ometimes revived long after the writer's decea&s;e, what would be|come of them in a theatre where it is found e&s;&s;en|tially nece&s;&s;ary for the poet to attend the latter re|hear&s;als? And, as to the dre&s;&s;es, neither the Chi|ne&s;e or Tartar are ab&s;olutely unknown in Ireland; therefore, it is hoped, it will not be objected as a fault, that we have not gone to London either for de&s;ign or materials."</Q></P>
<P>Mandane was acted by Mi&s;s Ibbott&mdash;a lady of merit in &s;peaking blank ver&s;e. There was 150l. in the hou&s;e the &s;econd night of High Life, and it went off, if po&s;&s;ible, with more eclat than on the fir&s;t repre&s;entation, and Abington re&s;ounded in all parts of the theatre.

have been materially bettered with that lady in a leading character in comedy; the hou&s;e would have felt much injured and dimini&s;hed in profit had half price been taken, but it neither was then, nor ever &s;ince has been, the cu&s;tom to take under full price in Dublin.&mdash;I had a &s;trong party made again by my friends, which, with Mrs. Abington's name, &s;ettled the bu&s;ine&s;s to my ad|vantage; but I told her my rea&s;on for taking a tragedy was &s;olely that its gravity might aid and give &s;pirit when the new farce came on: The truth was, I wanted to entertain my&s;elf with act|ing Mr. Garrick's part of the Chine&s;e Zamti, in which I was &s;o fortunate as actually to plea&s;e be|yond mediocrity, though dre&s;&s;ed in an old red da|ma&s;k bed gown, which was what we termed the <HI>&s;tock bed gown</HI> for Brabantio and many other parts, and had for time immemorial been of that vene|rable u&s;e, and bore the marks of many years faith|ful &s;ervitude.</P>

to march by beat of drum in&s;tantly, to give immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance and repel the invaders; and it naturally occa&s;ioned a general panic and confu|&s;ion, and was the topic of univer&s;al conver&s;ation throughout the city of Dublin: Even the Abing|ton that day was not mentioned.&mdash;It quickly &s;ub&s;ided, and Mon&s;.

<P>High Life below Stairs was perpetually acted, and with never-failing &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;In ten days after its being performed, <HI>Abington's cap</HI> was &s;o much the ta&s;te with the ladies of fa&s;hion and ton, that there was not a milliner's &s;hop-window, great or &s;mall, but was adorned with it, and in large let|ters ABINGTON appeared to attract the pa&s;&s;ers by. This Abington-rage Woodward endeavour|ed to &s;uppre&s;s by ridicule, not here fit to be de|&s;cribed, but all to little, or rather to no purpo&s;e, for her reputation as an actre&s;s daily increa&s;ed, though on the remote ground of an unfa&s;hionable ill-&s;upported theatre.</P>

<P>A &s;mattering.&mdash;But as I was &s;aying, Sir, nothing came ami&s;s to my ma&s;ter. Bipeds, or quadrupeds; rationals, or animals; from the clamour of the bar, to the cackle of the barn|door; all were objects of his imitations, and my attention. In a word, Sir, for two whole years, under this learned profe&s;&s;or, I &s;tudied and &s;tarved, impoveri&s;hed mv body, and pampered my mind; till thinking my&s;elf pretty near equal to my ma|&s;ter, <HI>I made him one of his own bows, and &s;et up for my&s;elf.</HI></P>

<P>All this part went off very well, as they &s;oon felt the joke, laughed and applauded; nor did I di&s;like it my&s;elf, quite the contrary; for had I been really as de&s;cribed, it was not my fault, I could not have helped it. His Transfer's &s;cene went

off but very &s;o, &s;o; and Mrs. Cole, by Mr. Wood|ward, very bad indeed: for though great enter|tainment was expected from him, and he was dre&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t pains and &s;tudy, an article to which he paid much attention and con&s;idera|tion, yet his performance completely d&mdash;d the farce; he could not but with the utmo&s;t difficulty obtain permi&s;&s;ion to fini&s;h the part, it gave great di&s;gu&s;t; he lolled out his tongue and played &s;ome tricks to help it, which only added to its dam|nation.&mdash;Mr. Woodward having Mrs. Cole only to act, made the dre&s;&s;ing of that beldam much more complete than any other actor could do who had Shift and the other parts to equip and then dre&s;s again, and it had that advantage on his fir&s;t entrance: but all favour &s;oon vani&s;hed; for when Mrs. Cole complained of her rheumati&s;m, his manner was thought indecent by the gentle|men, and all the ladies &s;eemed offended with the character it&s;elf. Mr. Foote gave it out for &s;ome future evening with con&s;iderable alterations, but it was not attempted again, nor did he play, I believe, after his benefit, Feb. 11. He acted on &s;hares, and was &s;o &s;urrounded with Mr. Macklin, and the other performers of &s;trength, that the expedition was by no means profitable to him. The locality of the piece was one rea&s;on that cau&s;ed its unhappy fate,
<PB N="188" REF="188">
and another was, it had not the London fa&s;hion. So the Minor was turned out de&s;titute of friends and fortune.&mdash;That piece was then condemned in Dublin, though &s;upported by great actors; but in a few months after, in London, rai&s;ed its head, and did wonders.</P>
<P>From dear Dublin and good friends I took my farewell early in March, and left Mrs. Abington going on in full career to reach the pinnacle, where &s;he has many years &s;at &s;miling, and been looked at and admired with &s;incere plea&s;ure and re&s;pect by the fir&s;t per&s;ons in both the kingdoms: At that juncture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he had many di&s;advantages to &s;truggle with, &s;uch as the encountering Barry's, Wood|ward's, Mo&s;&s;op's, Fitzhenry's, and Dancer's be|nefit nights at Crow-&s;treet, which &s;ummon&s;es the Dublin world obeyed; and Smock-alley, which had &s;ometimes by luck her attractions and chance benefits, &amp;c. dragged on per force, but on the ides of March was on the verge of a certain down|fall.&mdash;Plays were thus acted then in Crow-&s;treet: The Orphan.&mdash;Ca&s;talio, Mr. Barry; Chamont, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op; Polydore, Mr. Dexter; Monimia, Mrs. Dancer; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the other characters well dre&s;&s;ed and &s;upported, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, by re|ferring to the li&s;t of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e company, with the advan|tage of new &s;cenery, a new and elegant theatre, &amp;c.&mdash;</P>

<P>A &s;trange play for Mrs. Abington to chu&s;e it was! A New Way to pay Old Debts, March 17; but &s;he made amends by other performances that evening: On which occa&s;ion the old, the young, the gay, all bowed at her &s;hrine, as the temple of Thalia, &s;uch a&s;cendancy had &s;he thus quickly ac|quired over the public opinion.&mdash;This attachment towards the latter end of the &s;ea&s;on did not cea&s;e with the million; for, it is true, to attend the falling theatre was grown a great <HI>bore;</HI> yet &s;till langui&s;hing for Abington, and wi&s;hing to &s;ee her

<P>Mrs. Abington had not any occa&s;ion to reque&s;t this change of place or accumulation of honours, as they were not owing to &s;olicitation on her part, but the per&s;ons of di&s;tinction were &s;timulated to this de&s;ire by their eagerne&s;s to &s;atisfy them&s;elves by &s;eeing the new favourite tran&s;planted amid&s;t the gaudy flowers of Crow-&s;treet, where they did not doubt but &s;he would &s;oon gain a &s;tate of di|&s;tinction, whenever the arti&s;ts of theatrical flori&s;ts met to &s;ignalize, di&s;tingui&s;h, and decide the claims to the prizes when they &s;crutinized on the play|hou&s;e auriculas and the gaudy tulips.</P>
<P>All that was contracted for by the per&s;ons of quality for the managers and Mrs. Abington was, I believe, &s;trictly abided by, faithfully executed, and an&s;wered to the infinite &s;atisfaction of all parties.

<P>It not only is galling, but more is really to be &s;aid for it than is always allowed: that merit &s;hould be cheri&s;hed and rai&s;e its head, is a fir&s;t principle and duty from the audience and the ma|nager; but when con&s;idered as a le&s;&s;ening of pride and income to another, it is a &s;erious matter to the SOUL &s;o piqued, nor are any minds &s;o &s;oon hurt on the lea&s;t frivolous occa&s;ions as tho&s;e of the theatre; and &s;ometimes it happens a phaeno|menon really &s;tarts up.&mdash;Mrs. Jordan, four years ago only, playing at York at 1l. 11s. 6d. per week, was thought really very clever by London performers who &s;aw her there, but all &s;aid it would not do among them; yet by great luck, great good fortune indeed, and to be for an hundred

A happy ri&s;e!&mdash;I hope it will la&s;t her life, and with care make her career &s;ucce&s;sful, as it has &s;o providentially and wonderfully begun.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jordan is certainly the lucky child of Fortune, lulled, care&s;&s;ed, and nur&s;ed in the lap of Nature: &s;he is undoubtedly the reigning Thalia of the age 1790, and de&s;ervedly &s;o; and to her comic talents, archne&s;s, whim, and fancy, I &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ively bow, and al&s;o acknowledge her huma|nity and goodne&s;s to her late parent:&mdash;But am compelled, as Mr. Manager, to declare, like Mr. Foote in his Devil upon Two Sticks, (as great|ne&s;s knows it&s;elf) that Mrs. Jordan, at making a bargain, is too many for the cunninge&s;t devil of us all.</P>
<P>Speaking of Mrs. Abington's merit, in the co|mic line, occa&s;ioned my introducing Mrs. Jordan's name at the &s;ame time; and as I cannot yet quit Mrs. Abington's &s;ituation, whom I left at her great benefit in Dublin, it may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed,

from her being &s;o happily tran&s;planted, that &s;he derived many advantages from playing with Mr. Woodward, Mr. Macklin, and other regulars; nor was Mr. Woodward a lo&s;er, but a gainer by the acqui&s;ition to his &s;tage; as Mrs. Abington re|bounded the ball equal to the force with which Woodward &s;truck it.&mdash;But now another irk|&s;ome matter aro&s;e in con&s;equence of her &s;ucce&s;s; where our pa&s;&s;ions or partialities are predominant, it is not always rea&s;on can be li&s;tened to or obey|ed. It was very apparent, from motives of policy and &s;ound judgment that Mrs. Abington &s;hould be engaged on the mo&s;t eligible terms, otherwi&s;e they could not hope &s;uch a ri&s;ing actre&s;s would article. To this Woodward did not he&s;itate, as it a&s;&s;i&s;ted his comedies, and an agreement was &s;ettled for the following winter. But when it is con&s;idered Mrs. Dancer then played all the prin|cipal characters in comedy as well as in tragedy, it made the &s;ea of Crow-&s;treet troubled; the waves that looked calm turned to rough breakers, and the open &s;ea to ri&s;e and threaten a &s;torm: for when tho&s;e ladies acted in the &s;ame plays, as in the Lady's La&s;t Stake, Mrs. Dancer played Mrs. Conque&s;t, Mrs. Abington Mi&s;s Notable; (by the bye, Mrs. Jordan, why have you neglected Mi&s;s Notable!)&mdash;In Love for Love, Angelica, Mrs. Dancer; Mi&s;s Prue, Mrs. Abington; and many
<PB N="194" REF="194">
other plays where they were often mutually con|cerned, and &s;ometimes where Mrs. Abington was the rival Fine Lady, which &s;ome plays admit, where the parts are of equal con&s;equence. Mi&s;s Notable and Mi&s;s Prue, from the archne&s;s and excellent acting of Mrs. Abington, &s;eemed to have the deci&s;ion at the winning po&s;t for fame; but I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, tho&s;e comic characters will ever, when well &s;upported, obtain the loud applau&s;e, however well acted Mrs. Conque&s;t and Angelica may be by any actre&s;&s;es whatever, as the hoy|dens are &s;o well caculated for what we term <HI>&s;tage effect.</HI></P>
<P>This divi&s;ion of hands from the upper and lower part of the hou&s;e, it was not likely Mrs. Dancer (as queen of the theatre) could reli&s;h or gulp down by any means to make the Abington plea&s;ing or agreeable. This proved, and grew offen&s;ive to Mr. Barry, as he was then as pa&s;&s;ionate an inamorato as ever youth|ful poet fancied when he loved, and would have thrown immediate bars to the engagement with Mrs. Abington, and greatly impeded her rapid good fortune, had not a &s;udden and impor|tant matter of a&s;toni&s;hment at that time &s;tarted up to the amazement of every facu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of eyes, ears, &amp;c. for Barry and Woodward, lulled in their long wi&s;hed for &s;ecurity, became the dupes of their own

This dreadful alarm was no le&s;s than the certainty of a report being confirmed as real, which at fir&s;t they treated as unlikely, vague, and impo&s;&s;ible; but it proved &s;trictly true, that Mr. Mo&s;&s;op from the encouragement and in&s;tigation of all his friends, and patronized by the Counte&s;s of Bran|don, of powerful &s;way, with many leaders of fa&s;hion, had certainly taken Smock-alley theatre on a long lea&s;e, purpo&s;ing many expen&s;ive and gaudy alterations, &amp;c. to oppo&s;e Crow-&s;treet, in the month of October the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on. Barry and Woodward (to prevent if po&s;&s;ible this dread|ful undertaking) made him liberal offers; nay, even humbled them&s;elves before him, to intreat Mo&s;&s;op to name his own terms. All this only increa&s;ed his pride, and he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">urned at every kind|ne&s;s or emolument, &s;ubmitted to his acceptance and con&s;ideration: they even offered him one thou&s;and pounds Engli&s;h, and two benefits when|ever he cho&s;e to take them; but all would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o, though they certainly would have been lo&s;ers by his acceptance: but their &s;ituation was de|&s;perate; therefore all they could do was right,

For this fixed refu&s;al of Mr. Garrick's there could be no remedy, as law would be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> ex|periment
<PB N="212" REF="212">
for a young actor; which, if I had ha&s;tily attempted, he would have prevented my imme|diate compliance with the article, but then, when enraged, he would have obliged me to appear in a menial &s;tation, or forfeited all the &s;alary; &s;o that I mu&s;t have lo&s;t my periodical payment &s;till, or have paid &s;everely indeed for it, by working as his negroe &s;lave till the end of May, and that he well knew.

<P>After being deprived of my &s;alary I met Mr. Garrick in Covent-Garden, not having admit|tance in his hou&s;e, he being always denied; and at the theatre he hardly knew me, I had behaved &s;o ill by a&s;king for my &s;alary to <HI>ruin</HI> him, <HI>poor man!</HI> When I told him that I had &s;poke to the prompter to know when my benefit-night was to be fixed, but had received no an&s;wer, he &s;tood gazing, and like Lady Pentweazle, called up a look, not with one eye only, but with two piercers, meaning to intimidate me by his dignity, which might have had the de&s;ired effect two years before that en|counter, but not then. At la&s;t he &s;aid, he was a&s;toni&s;hed at the unexpected ab&s;urdity as well as the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the reque&s;t, and that the
<PB N="213" REF="213">
bu&s;ine&s;s of the theatre was &s;o arranged it could not be; but, to cut &s;hort all intercour&s;e on the &s;ubject, he concluded with &s;aying, he would not comply with it: and here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve was inju&s;tice, merely for fear I &s;hould add to the little &s;tock I had &s;ecured much again&s;t his wi&s;hes, and he hoped by my being idle in London, and not receiving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;alary, I &s;hould make it fly as quickly as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">lor does his money on a return from a voyage, and then be more within the falcon's reach. Now my benefit was very material to me, as I knew I &s;hould be favoured with a very good one, though in May, and duty to my&s;elf made me &s;erious with him; I therefore boldly told him that I &s;hould make my lo&s;s of &s;alary and benefit one bu&s;ine&s;s in a court o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ju&s;tice, and charge my benefit at 200l.; which added to the breach of article would not be le&s;s than two or three hundred more, and would be a good compen&s;ation, and added, with a bow and a &s;mile, I could not wi&s;h for a better banker to to draw upon&mdash;what I &s;poke was truth. He then humm'd and haw'd, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why really now, why, Tate, why now you are d&mdash;d ridiculous!"</Q> and he walked me into Varney's, the hou&s;e|keeper's room at the theatre, and &s;ent for Cro&s;s: Mr. Lacey was al&s;o there, and they &s;ettled my be|nefit for Saturday the 3d of May, and de&s;ired Mr. Fox, whom Mr. Lacey &s;aid he had a great regard
<PB N="214" REF="214">
for, might bring in tickets to &s;uch a &s;um as he &s;pecified:&mdash;I agreed to the reque&s;t. The Mr. Fox I mention lives in Bow-&s;treet, and I have often from that time to this, at different periods, been obliged to him, and ever found him kind and attentive to &s;erve me; and I have heard Mr. Fox (who was then a young &s;tage candidate) de|clare, that he was lucky with his tickets, and plea&s;ed with Mr. Lacey's de&s;ire and allotment.</P>
<P>The play I fixed on was the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother: Ore&s;tes, Mr. Wilkin&s;on; Hermione, Mrs. Yates; Andromache, by a Gentlewoman; with the pro|logue to the Author, Lady Pentweazle, and the Uphol&s;terer.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rea&s;ons, as in Dublin, for not giving my imitations proved, that the like policy was nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;till pre&s;erved, at lea&s;t for that year of my adventures and theatrical exploits in London.</P>
<P>The gentlewoman I adverti&s;ed for her fir&s;t ap|pearance in Andromache, was no other than the <HI>Mrs. Wier,</HI> whom I have mentioned early in this multifarious hi&s;tory, where I met (luckily or unluckily, as the Fates will determine) with that good old gentleman, Mr. Baker, manager of the York company in October 1758.</P>
<P>If the reader will honour me with the remem|brance &s;o long back, of what I fear &s;eems not only
<PB N="215" REF="215">
trifling but tire&s;ome, he will recollect that I men|tioned Mrs. Wier being at that time mi&s;tre&s;s of a milliner's &s;hop near Pall Mall, where I &s;aw Mrs. Roach, who boldly, and with the &s;pirit of an Amazon, went down to York to &s;upply Mrs. Dancer's Lady Townly, Indiana, &amp;c. thinking like Keck&s;y&mdash;<HI>who's afraid!</HI></P>
<P>This Mrs. Wier had been made mi&s;tre&s;s of an ample well-furni&s;hed milliner's &s;hop by Sir Fran|cis Delaval, and properly &s;upplied with all &s;orts of geer for <HI>gentlewomen,</HI> and eke al&s;o for <HI>gentlemen:</HI> Mrs. Wier's &s;hop by no means an&s;wered, tho' Sir Francis Delaval had not &s;pared any expence or recommendation within his power to render it lucrative.</P>
<P>I am bound to &s;peak of this Sir Francis Delaval with reverence and regard, not only for his own partiality and friend&s;hip, but for the favours I have been formerly honoured with by the whole family, and obligations of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing kind; not only at Sir Francis's hou&s;e, then bordering on Soho &s;quare, but at Seaton Delaval, a few miles from Newca&s;tle: but of that family, of whom I &s;peak &s;o warmly, none remains within my knowledge but Lord and Lady Delaval, whom I have had the honour of &s;eeing frequently at Sir Francis's. There was no difference in Sir Fran|cis's behaviour whether I &s;aw him in London or
<PB N="216" REF="216">
farther remote; for many gentlemen wear different faces on &s;eeing an actor in London and &s;eeing him in the country.</P>
<P>Now the milliner's &s;hop, mentioned under the patronage of Sir Francis, not an&s;wering in all par|ticulars, and the knight being determined his gen|tleman's gentlewoman &s;hould be quite the thing, took a hou&s;e for her in Suffolk-&s;treet in the Strand, and furni&s;hed it as a reception for boarders, that Mrs. Wier might obtain a livelihood. At that hou&s;e I had the plea&s;ure of often &s;eeing a very &s;en|&s;ible, agreeable, well-bred lady, who occupied the fir&s;t floor, then Mrs. Ford, but after that &s;he had the honour to be Mrs. Colman; but the foe or friend of mankind, call him which we will, (Mr. Death) did not choo&s;e to &s;ee &s;uch an agreeable and tempting companion out of his clutches, but &s;neeringly and enviou&s;ly threw his dart, and with one &s;troke levelled a fair one, lamented by all who knew her.</P>
<P>But even this lodging-hou&s;e did not altogether an&s;wer for Mrs. Wier, or &s;ucceed to her expec|tations in the round of a twelvemonth's vici&s;&s;i|tude. She had ever been fond of plays, and on my return from Ireland, &s;eriou&s;ly reque&s;ted &s;he might have a &s;tage-trial on my benefit night; this I con&s;ented to, and &s;he was to be the Andromache in the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother. On that being &s;ettled, I,
<PB N="217" REF="217">
in three or four days after, received a note from Sir Francis, de&s;iring to &s;ee me on particular bu&s;i|ne&s;s in Soho-&s;quare: On the afternoon I called it &s;o happened that Mr. Foote was there, with whom I had been on di&s;tant terms ever &s;ince our breach in March 1759.&mdash;This vi&s;it was almo&s;t imme|diately after dinner:&mdash;Sir Francis expecting me, had de&s;ired I might be &s;hewn into another room, knowing his friend Foote's and my antipathy. He in&s;tantly came, and laughingly told me, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of his note was to inform me he had col|lected a large party for my benefit; adding, he had a reque&s;t to make, but mu&s;t be under the nece&s;&s;ity of deferring it till the next day; for, &s;ays he, your old friend Foote is in the dining-room, and from your late di&s;agreement I judge it will not be agree|able to either, as the meeting will be awkward; adding, he did not know how to act, unle&s;s, Wil|kin&s;on, you will let me take you by the hand as my particular friend, and as a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tranger? I, like Peter Paragraph, by way of reply &s;aid, I c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uld not re&s;i&s;t the propo&s;ed honour of being in|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">duced as Sir Francis Delaval's particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">riend; be&s;ides, I added, Mr. Foote had, of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ons in the world, the lea&s;t right to be angry with me for mimicry, and indeed he had been by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e intere&s;tedly the obliged per&s;on; and Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">te had him&s;elf declared on Drury-Lane &s;tage,
<PB N="218" REF="218">
that any imitations of him&s;elf, by Mr. Wilkin&s;on, were at the &s;ervice of the public.</P>
<P>So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nder the &s;anction of being Sir Francis's particular gue&s;t I entered the room where Foote was, and &s;everal other gentlemen; Foote &s;eemed hurt at fir&s;t, but after the introduction as pro|po&s;ed, he behaved with great politene&s;s.</P>
<P>As the circling gla&s;s went round, Mr. Foote grew more cordial and cheerful, and began &s;peak|ing of tables in the fir&s;t &s;tyle of elegance in Ire|land and Scotland&mdash;that &s;everal noblemen's hou&s;es in both places were &s;upported with every luxury that a London table could furni&s;h: for if London had the &s;uperiority in &s;ome particular articles, the other places had in greater perfection what Lon|don could not &s;o ea&s;ily purcha&s;e; which made the equality of good things more upon a level than the Engli&s;h would readily admit; but to which Sir Francis would not a&s;&s;ent. And as a trait I have before ob&s;erved in Foote's character when his real be&s;t friend, Sir Francis Delaval, left the room, where there were not le&s;s than eight or ten per&s;ons, each of whom he knew would relate again what he &s;aid, he bur&s;t out into a loud laugh, and turning to me &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Wilkin&s;on! did you ever hear &s;uch a hound giving his &s;entiments on good tables and living?&mdash;Since my return from Ireland," added Foote, "I have had the
<PB N="219" REF="219">
mortification to dine here &s;ix times, and each day a d&mdash;d large loin of pork on the table, which he calls a dinner!&mdash;By G&mdash;d I'll not dine here again the&s;e three months; for I &s;uppo&s;e he means to run his loin of pork again&s;t the Beggar's Opera?"</Q>&mdash;which had been acted a great number of nights at Covent-Garden, Mr. Beard being Macheath; Mi&s;s Brent, the Polly:&mdash;It was equal to the fir&s;t run when it came out at Lincoln's-Inn-Fields Theatre, 1727&mdash;when a wit &s;aid, that the Beggar's Opera
<Q><L>Made Rich gay,</L>
<L>And Gay rich.</L></Q></P>
<P>That piece al&s;o occa&s;ioned a material event: His Grace the Duke of Bolton was irre&s;i&s;tibly en&s;laved by the Syren Polly (Mi&s;s Fenton); but neither per&s;ua&s;ion, riches, nor &s;ettlement, could re|lax or &s;often the heart of the fair one; in &s;hort, nothing le&s;s could purcha&s;e her hand and heart than the &s;haring his honours as the Duche&s;s of Bolton:&mdash;to the which he a&s;&s;ented, and never had cau&s;e to repent, as &s;he filled every duty of that high &s;tation with becoming dignity&mdash;as a duche&s;s, wife, and mother. Admired by all, &s;he enjoyed her unfaded laurels for many years, as the Bolton family can te&s;tify.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="220">
As to Mr. Foote's remark on the loin of pork, it might be partly true; for though Sir Francis was liberal and extravagant in many points, nicety of food was the la&s;t thing he ever thought of; if there was but plenty, he never cared for the qua|lity or the luxuries of a table:&mdash;and had he ac|tually heard Foote, he would only have laughed at him, and with him; he knew his foibles, and admired all Foote's &s;allies of humour that &s;o often &s;et the table on a roar.<Q><L>Where be his gibes now, his fla&s;hes of merriment?</L>
<L>Not one now to mock his own grinning:</L>
<L>Alas! poor Foote!</L></Q> But Sir Francis was &s;o far even with Foote, that he enjoyed a &s;troke again&s;t him to the full as much as any other per&s;on:&mdash;He would laugh with Foote when acting Cadwalladar, yet was &s;uch a mi&s;|chievous wag, that he would teaze Mr. A&mdash;ce till he was enraged at Foote:&mdash;and all this was give-and-take, fair play:&mdash;He was fond of tricks with his gue&s;t, who vi&s;ited him at Seaton Delaval. Mr. Obrien, on his return from a vi&s;it there, re|lated to me many whim&s;ical frolics which were practi&s;ed with much joke and good humour; and Mr. Obrien told them in &s;uch a manner as made the narrative very entertaining,</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="221">
When Mr. Foote and the re&s;t of the company departed, Sir Francis detained me in order to re|late the reque&s;t he had hinted at in his note; which was, he &s;aid, relative to an alteration of my play:&mdash;to change the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother to that of Ta|merlane; and that he wi&s;hed to introduce, in&s;tead of Mrs. Pritchard, our old friend Mrs. Wier, who&s;e welfare he had much concern for, and would in&s;truct her in the character of Arpa&s;ia.</P>
<P>Sir Francis Delaval was greatly attached to the drama, &s;o much &s;o, that it is well remembered, and univer&s;ally known he acted the part of Othello in March 1751, at Drury-Lane theatre, with la|dies and gentlemen of fa&s;hion of his acquaintance. Sir Francis's per&s;on was noble, hand&s;ome, and commanding, and very proper to give a &s;triking re&s;emblance of the Moori&s;h General. There is a &s;trong likene&s;s of that great patron of the actors and actre&s;&s;es at Lord Mexborough's, at Methley <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ar Pontefract. To Lord and Lady Mexbo|rough I am under numerous obligations; I could with plea&s;ure &s;ay a great deal more, but were I to expatiate on all I feel for the many per&s;ons to whom I am indebted for favours, it would fill the large&s;t book that ever was publi&s;hed, and fur|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">h a little library.</P>
<P>Sir John, now Lord Delaval, acted Iago, and was pronounced incomparable in judgment and
<PB N="222" REF="222">
di&s;play of abilities, and it was allowed by all to be a critical performance of that difficult charac|ter. Applau&s;e on that night's acting need not be mentioned, as the reader may be a&s;&s;ured it was commanded, and not le&s;s merited. Sir Francis hired the theatre at a very con&s;iderable expence, as not only that of a benefit, but the &s;uppo&s;ed profits of Mr. Garrick's be&s;t character for attrac|tion was added to that charge.</P>
<P>The family aided Sir Francis to fill the theatre with their own acquaintance only, which included all the nobility of the three kingdoms then in London, but not any one was admitted without a proper ticket from Sir Francis or his brothers, who had calculated the number the theatre would contain, and that without di&s;tinction of places to prevent offence: and in con&s;equence, when the be&s;t places were occupied, the upper gallery was as brilliant with &s;tars and garters as the boxes and pit below.</P>
<P>The rehear&s;als were (I have been told) entirely conducted by my good friend Macklin; Sir Fran|cis held that gentleman in high e&s;teem as his pri|vate confidential friend; and when he alluded to the teaching Mrs. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Arpa&s;ia, he added, Mack|lin had promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, which free opinion collectively made me obei&s;ant.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="223">
I mention, or rather introduce here the more rea|dily, the&s;e theatrical circum&s;tances of Sir Francis Delaval, to account for his &s;tage furor in teach|ing Mrs. Wier the character of Arpa&s;ia, who had many claims on his kindne&s;s to in&s;truct her:&mdash;We mu&s;t con&s;ider &s;he was the <HI>wife</HI> of one Wier, who had &s;erved him faith|fully for many years, and had ever a&s;&s;i&s;ted Sir Francis in his various attachments; for no &s;ooner was one &s;cheme accompli&s;hed but he was on the wing for another.&mdash;So Wier was never idle, but was an indu&s;trious &s;ervant; and it might be &s;aid truly of him that he always had his hands full, and was kept in perpetual employment.</P>
<P>I had not any objection to her playing Arpa&s;ia, and he gave me a genteel order for three &s;ide|boxes; for which he paid mo&s;t liberally, and ap|pointed two or three dozen of his friends to go into the pit.</P>
<P>When the night came there was a very bril|liant audience; my own friends were numerous&mdash;Lady Granard, Lady Tyrawley, Mrs. Skelton, Lord Verney, were all there, and filled their &s;epa|rate boxes. Mrs. Wier was well received, as is generally the ca&s;e with young performers from the candour of a London audience; but &s;he was lan|guid, timid, and barely reached mediocrity, tho' not by any means laughable or offen&s;ively ridicu|lous;
<PB N="224" REF="224">
indeed &s;he began her &s;tage career too late in life, being at that time, as near as I can gue&s;s, thirty-five or thirty-&s;ix years of age:&mdash;She wanted animation and expre&s;&s;ion for Arpa&s;ia. But &s;he has quitted the&s;e earthly realms of abode, and has fol|lowed her Mone&s;es, and left me, her Bajazet, to bemoan her l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s.</P>
<P>This benefit, which I obtained from Garrick with difficulty, proved a very great and plea&s;ing addition to my accumulating funds.</P>
<P>The theatre clo&s;ed in May, and I, without &s;ee|ing Mr. Garrick, having then obtained my free|dom by the expiration of my article that had ex|i&s;ted from October 1757, &s;et off once more on a journey to Port&s;mouth, where I expected open arms to receive me, but was in my expectations di&s;appointed: for though my friends were as u&s;ual glad to &s;ee me, the players were quite the rever&s;e. The acting what parts, and reviving what plays I plea&s;ed, they repre&s;ented, in &s;trong terms, as very great innovations on the rules and orders e&s;tabli&s;hed in their &s;ociety or common-wealth; as many u&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ul members on that account had withdrawn them|&s;elves in di&s;gu&s;t, greatly to the prejudice of their bu&s;ine&s;s in general.&mdash;The Hermoine, Mrs. Daly, expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf as g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eatly injured by my having introduced Mi&s;s Morri&s;on and Mi&s;s White the year before, who had acted &s;everal of her favourite

<P>The Bath company, headed by Mr. Griffith and Mr. Kea&s;berry, lured by the fair promi&s;e of a plentiful harve&s;t, built a temporary theatre in that city; and finding I was at variance with the gran|dees of Port&s;mouth, gave me a very genteel offer to join the forces under their direction, which I accepted with plea&s;ure, as the change was very &s;atisfactory; and for good rea&s;ons, as it promi&s;ed not only to be lucrative but eligible, and particu|larly plea&s;ant: and another &s;trong charm which it had with me was variety and novelty; two quali|ties ever predominant with me in all &s;ituations, and at that time, from my perpetual change of place, was become habitual. So that for the &s;ake of variety the city or the village had at different
<PB N="228" REF="228">
times equal charms according to my various di&s;|po&s;itions. But either would have given me &s;atiety, if confined to it alone. And could I live as I plea&s;ed, now I am writing this in March 1790, I would every &s;ix weeks or two months be on different ground, and with a full pur&s;e think I could make the whole year very delightful, by being in Lon|don, Paris, Bath, Edinburgh, &amp;c.</P>
<P>However to Winche&s;ter I went, and found it to a high degree agreeable, and the weather added to make it delightful. It was one of the fine&s;t &s;um|mers I ever remember; and certainly with youth, health, &s;pirits, and money in the pocket, a love of acting, gratified and attended with applau&s;e and &s;ucce&s;s at the age of twenty-one years, was an en|viable &s;ituation not to be de&s;cribed; and all the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings at that time I enjoyed, which are &s;eldom to be equalled in any &s;ituation of life.</P>
<P>The enthu&s;ia&s;m attendant on a young man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of public favour, and being the utmo&s;t of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's wi&s;hes, can only be felt, for it is not to be de&s;cribed;&mdash;it is a delu&s;ion of magical felicity known to the actor only:&mdash;few there are who have at one time that accumulation of good gifts ju&s;t mentioned, and I really then was ble&s;&s;ed with them all. Not that I now can boa&s;t tho&s;e enviable trea&s;ures of health, plea&s;ure, &amp;c. but as Lady Pentweazle &s;ays, <HI>I have had my day, Mr.</HI>

But I never forgot the true re&s;pect and protection due to my mother, &s;o in &s;ome degree I de&s;erved the ble&s;&s;ings I enjoyed.</P>
<P>At Winche&s;ter I received many favours and civi|lities, but not from any one &s;o particularly as from the Marquis of Tavi&s;tock, elde&s;t &s;on to his Grace the late Duke of Bedford, to who&s;e genero&s;ity and kindne&s;s I was much obliged.</P>

The comedy of the Minor, that had met &s;o unlucky a fate in Ireland a few months before, was ju&s;t then printed and publi&s;hed, and was acting with a rage a&s;toni&s;hing. It is not de&s;cribable the crowds of all degrees that cru&s;hed in to that little theatre in the Haymarket, night after night in the hotte&s;t months of the year. The fa&s;hion of not publi&s;hing is quite modern, and the favourite pieces not being printed, but kept under lock and key, is of infinite prejudice to us poor devils in the country theatres, as we really cannot afford to pay for the purcha&s;e of MSS.&mdash;The only time I ever exerci&s;ed my pen on &s;uch an occa&s;ion was on a trial of nece&s;&s;ity.&mdash;Mr. Harris bought that ex|cellent comic opera of the Duenna from Mr. She|ridan; I &s;aw it &s;everal times, and finding it im|practicable to move Mr. Harris's tenderne&s;s, I locked my&s;elf up in my room, &s;at down fir&s;t the jokes I remembered, then I laid a book of the &s;ongs before me, and with magazines kept the re|gulation of the &s;cenes, and by the help of a nu|merous collection of ob&s;olete Spani&s;h plays I pro|duced an excellent opera; I may &s;ay <HI>excellent</HI>&mdash;and an unprecedented compilement; for whenever Mr. Younger, or any other country manager wanted a copy of the Duenna, Mr. Harris told them they might play Mr. Wilkin&s;on's: hundreds have &s;een it in every town in Great-Britain and Ireland.&mdash;

Mrs. Webb has acted the part of the Duenna in <HI>my Opera,</HI> as I call it, many nights at Edin|burgh&mdash;Mr. Suett, the Jew, at York, &amp;c.</P>
<P>While I was at Winche&s;ter his Royal High|ne&s;s the Duke of York, who had honoured my benefit at Port&s;mouth in 1758, was at Southamp|ton for his health and the advantage of &s;ea|bathing.

was in &s;tudy, and would have been &s;oon acted, but the unexpected honour was a mo&s;t flattering and lucky &s;troke for <HI>me, the piece, and Mr. Kea&s;|berry:</HI> It brought a great hou&s;e, and obtain|ed uncommon applau&s;e, which was increa&s;ed by the attention and di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of appro|bation be&s;towed by His Royal Highne&s;s.&mdash;I was honoured with his thanks by Col.

<P>The whole &s;ea&s;on was indeed a &s;cene of unin|terrupted harmony and pro&s;perity with our little community.&mdash;Indeed Mr. Kea&s;berry was &s;ome|times ob&s;treperous, and actually turned me out of his hou&s;e when the morning gun fired, that be|ing the &s;ignal for &s;ending me home to bed.

The late noble Earl of Ef|fingham, who was remarkably corpulent, evinced equal alacrity with dead nimble-footed Clytus, and gave evident proofs of &s;uperior agility; for in|&s;tead of making his way to the box-door, he with one &s;pring of the utmo&s;t ea&s;e, &s;wiftne&s;s, and dexteri|ty, vaulted over the &s;ide-box, and lighted on his feet on a row in the middle of the pit, &s;tanding erect; the &s;eat gave proof to the credit of the carpen|ter;

<P>In a few minutes the trifling cau&s;e that occa|&s;ioned this univer&s;al panic &s;ub&s;ided, and was &s;oon extingui&s;hed; the audience called to order, the la|dies in&s;tead of fainting, being &s;urrounded by mar|tial heroes, &s;miled; Lord Effingham returned to his box, but not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the way he went into the pit: No &s;ooner was his Lord&s;hip &s;ettled in <HI>&s;latu quo</HI> than all the gentlemen of the army (for he was univer&s;ally beloved) gave a general &s;alutation, which his Lord&s;hip returned, and after a hearty laugh on all &s;ides the play was ordered to go on, and old grey-headed Clytus made his &s;econd ap|pearance after death, and pro&s;trated him&s;elf once more a victim at the feet of Alexander. It ap|peared &s;o truly ridiculous, that the convul&s;ive fits of laughter which involuntarily en&s;ued, may ea&s;ier be conceived than de&s;cribed; it was truly whim|&s;ical, and mutually entertaining. Joy and fear ge|nerally run into extremes, as was the ca&s;e; for the remaining part of the fourth act of the tragi-co|medy was all laughter: The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed prince&s;s Statira in her alarm had not caught up a blanket (Hecuba like), but actually ran out of her thatched palace to the friendly refuge and a&s;ylum of the fir&s;t clay-cold ditch that opened to receive her; and having recovered from her fears, returned

<P>This anecdote of Winche&s;ter had e&s;caped my memory had it not been refre&s;hed by a gentleman of fa&s;hion who was pre&s;ent at that night's exhibi|tion, and with whom I had the plea&s;ure of &s;upping at Mr. Broadhead's in Portland Place, March 1787, where Mr. Kemble was al&s;o at table.&mdash;In|deed the pre&s;ent Lord Effingham remembers it perfectly well. As I have taken the liberty to intro|duce here the late and the pre&s;ent Lord Effingham, I think it highly incumbent for me publicly to acknowledge the favours conferred on me by the late Lord Effingham, at that time at Winche&s;ter; and in con&s;equence thereof I have been much ho|noured, &s;ince, by the pre&s;ent Lord and Lady Ef|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ingham, for whom I truly hold the mo&s;t pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ound and re&s;pectful gratitude.</P>

<P>It had received much retouching and many al|terations by the ingenious hand of Mr. Foote,

&s;ince I had &s;een it the winter before in Ireland.&mdash;The Introduction, Smirk the auctioneer, and Dr. Squintum's Epilogue, were all entirely new. I went two or three nights, but with great diffi|culty got admittance, the crowds to &s;ee it were &s;o numerous. I took that opportunity of hiring a po&s;t-chai&s;e for the day to vi&s;it Cowley, meaning once more to claim and renew my acquaintance with Mr. Rich, who was then at his country-&s;eat; but it was not attended with the &s;ucce&s;s I wi&s;hed: he was very civil, but the play-bill from Win|che&s;ter, though aggrandized with his Royal High|ne&s;s the Duke of York's patronage, had not the effect I expected it would have had: One hour was the full length of our <HI>tete-a-tete.</HI> However I did not repent my journey to London, as I had mended my performances in the Minor by &s;eeing Mr. Foote's playing the parts, and the better pre|pared for my next acting of them at Winche&s;ter, which happened a few days after my return.</P>
<P>I judged, though Mr. Rich and I had not then agreed, it might be brought about, and if not, by my utility and con&s;equence to the company at Winche&s;ter, and my friend&s;hip with Mr. Kea&s;|berry, I depended to a certainty on his intere&s;t to explain and &s;peak &s;o favourably of me to Mr. Arthur, manager of the Bath theatre, that I &s;hould &s;ecure a principal engagement there f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">

This trip from Bath was to the advantage of the players; yet the gentlemen of the army deemed it a compliment to them&s;elves, and as &s;uch requi&s;ite for them to make a return for what they e&s;teemed a favour: and indeed they were all, from the general down to the en&s;ign, kept to the &s;tricte&s;t military duty. What a relief cer|tainly mu&s;t a decent well-conducted little theatre have been to them&s;elves and their variety of vi|&s;itors from all parts, of the kingdom, who came by way of re&s;pect to &s;ee their friends in the camp and the general grand review, and al&s;o as a plea|&s;ant trip of relaxation from London? I do not believe in the cour&s;e of twelve weeks, three gentle|men ever attempted to get behind the &s;cenes during the repre&s;entation: for though the &s;top was ea&s;y from the pit to the &s;tage, the decorum was &s;uch that I do not recollect a &s;ingle infringe|ment.

capitulation with all the honours of war, with <Q REND="inline">"&s;uch accommodation and be&s;ort as levelled with her breeding."</Q> But when women &s;tand a &s;iege they are hard to be conquered, and generally &s;ub|due the bolde&s;t.

An in&s;tance of which happened in the late King James's time.

This indignity ca&s;t upon a gentleman, only for having maltreated a player, was looked upon as the con|cern of every gentleman; and a party was &s;oon formed to a&s;&s;ert and vindicate their honour by humbling this favoured actor, who&s;e &s;light injury had been judged equal to &s;o &s;evere a notice. Ac|cordingly the next time Smith acted he was re|ceived with a chorus of cat-calls, that &s;oon con|vinced him he &s;hould not be &s;uffered to proceed in his part: upon which, without the la&s;t di&s;com|po&s;ure, he ordered the curtain to be dropped; and having a competent fortune of his own, thought the conditions of adding to it, by his remaining upon the &s;tage, were too dear, and from that day entirely quitted it.

"Why, no, Sir," replied Macklin gravely, "not as Sir John Dorilant, but &s;trictly natural as Mr. Red|di&s;h: for you know, Sir, he has adverti&s;ed him|&s;elf as a gentleman of ea&s;y fortune."</Q></P>

<P>I fear I have tired my gracious reader;&mdash;but if out of ninety and nine I can reform one actor, I obtain a theatrical pro&s;elyte for his own and the public good, I gain my end, and &s;olicit forgive|ne&s;s for my tediou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

doubted, by having &s;o long neglected my indi&s;pen|&s;able duty at the camp-theatre, and return now, not as a de&s;erter, but a willing volunteer, and mention that my benefit was on Friday, Septem|ber 12, and was honoured with every attendance I could po&s;&s;ibly hope for.&mdash;The play was The Confederacy; my Di&s;h of Tea, with the farce of Lethe:&mdash;I played Mrs. Amlet, Lord Chalk&s;tone, and the Old Man. I had many genteel pre&s;ents from Lord Tavi&s;tock, and &s;everal of the leading gentlemen of the army. About that time Mr. Garrick had &s;ome di&s;pute and quarrel with my friend Mr. Macklin, and had to a certainty pur|loined his favourite farce of Love A-la-Mode, then in high rage of fa&s;hion with the public, both from its novelty and real attractive merits; and &s;o eager was he to hurt (if po&s;&s;ible) Mr. Mack|lin's property in that excellent piece, that he wi&s;h|ed to do it by the means of a divi&s;ion of the &s;poils, as Macklin was engaged at Covent-Gar|den: Nay, it is evident, to have obtained that de|&s;ired object, he would have run the hazard of a law-&s;uit, tho' he knew it mu&s;t have ended to his di&s;honour; but in that in&s;tance his &s;pleen out|went his policy, as the in&s;ertion of the following letters to me will decidedly prove. I never men|tioned the matter to Mr. Macklin, as it would have cau&s;ed mi&s;chief between him and Mr. Garrick.</P>

<P>THE managers have de&s;ired me to inform you that if you play the Scotchman in Love A-la-Mode, they will give you for every time that you &s;hall perform the part two guineas; and if you mingle in the other bu&s;ine&s;s, you &s;hall have your old &s;alary be&s;ides, and a benefit in cour&s;e of &s;alary when you return from Ireland. I wi&s;h you had called upon me when in town, for I always think that matters are &s;ooner adju&s;ted by one meeting of the parties than by a thou|&s;and letters. The managers de&s;ire their com|pliments to you.</P>

<P>I HAVE communicated the contents of your la&s;t to the managers, and they think you are too hard with them.&mdash;They are willing to give you two guineas for every time that you &s;hall play Sir Archy, and will engage that you &s;hall play it fifteen times at lea&s;t, and that you &s;hall have

your old &s;alary, be permitted to make your ex|cur&s;ions, during which time you are not to re|ceive any &s;alary; but if you return before the benefits, or &s;hall play in any of their nights at your return, that then your &s;alary &s;hall be con|tinued from the time of your return, and you be entitled to your benefit into the bargain&mdash;they cannot po&s;&s;ibly do more. If the terms are agreeable to you, plea&s;e to let my brother know, for I go into Derby&s;hire on Monday next, and they will &s;end you the part directly.</P>

<P>I RECEIVED yours, and &s;hall an&s;wer it di|rectly.&mdash;I can &s;carcely think that you are in earne&s;t with us from your la&s;t propo&s;ition.&mdash;You mu&s;t know that it is impo&s;&s;ible, from the nature of a theatre, to let you have a bene|fit before Chri&s;tmas: you mu&s;t fix with us, or be off immediately. Mr. Lacey and I will agree to give the two guineas per night for the acting Sir Archy; and during the run, or as long as

<P>The terms offered in tho&s;e letters were truly de&s;picable for the con&s;idered undertaking. Surely the labourer de&s;erves his hire, particularly as it was really a &s;ervice of danger which he artfully wi&s;hed me to undertake? for I was to engage and fight: and if any &s;poils or harve&s;t was to be ac|quired from the field of battle, he intended, like generals of <HI>former</HI> ages, to have reaped all the ad|vantages him&s;elf; I therefore po&s;itively declined
<PB N="265" REF="265">
any engagement whatever&mdash;Fal&s;taff like I would no more into the buck-ba&s;ket, rather preferring a winter &s;ituation out of London, than to be ham|pered by Mr. Garrick as his hobby-hor&s;e, unle&s;s well paid for all his cutting and fla&s;hing. Not|with&s;tanding Mr. Rich had refu&s;ed my profered &s;ervices, (which &s;eldom are held in value) before I made my determination how to arrange my en|gagements, I once more &s;teered for dear London, and left Winche&s;ter in the middle of October, to &s;ee what was going forward in the great world; but not with likelihood of any continuance there that year of our Lord. On the day of my departure Lord Tavi&s;tock honoured me with a pre&s;ent of fruit in a hamper well packed; I &s;et off highly gratified with the gift, but much more &s;o from the very flattering kindne&s;s of the compliment, than by the value of the donation: and to prove how good events are &s;ometimes produced by trifles, as once on a time the cackling of gee&s;e &s;aved a city, &s;o I, on my arrival in London, judged that this hamper of Bury pears, &amp;c. would be a gen|teel and very acceptable pre&s;ent to Mr. Rich, and more &s;o, as the fruit would keep with care for &s;ome weeks at that &s;ea&s;on of the year; and I ad|ded to the &s;aid hamper a very fine hare. In Lon|don the&s;e things are e&s;teemed pre&s;ents, but in York&s;hire I am under &s;uch con&s;tant obligations to

my friends, that I have not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to re|gret I am not a &s;port&s;man to be my own pro|vider, or not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a park or game-keeper, as I have con&s;tantly &s;ome kind remembrancer that &s;upplies me.</P>
