<P>THE following letters were written merely as a private tribute of friend&s;hip, and without the lea&s;t view of their pa&s;&s;ing from the hands of the gentleman to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed, into any other but tho&s;e of the Author's mo&s;t intimate connections. To the latter they were accordingly communicated; and it was &s;olely in compliance with their una|nimous, though perhaps too partial, opinion, that he con&s;ented to commit them to the pre&s;s. For that purpo&s;e a revi&s;al of them became ne|ce&s;&s;ary; in the cour&s;e of which he availed him|&s;elf of every means in his power, to render them le&s;s unworthy of public in&s;pection: and he feels a ju&s;t pride in acknowledging, that he has re|ceived much additional information from &s;eve|ral of his literary acquaintance in Swi&s;&s;erland; that by Captain Floyd's obliging communication of the very accurate journal he kept during their joint tour, he has been enabled to in&s;ert &s;everal material circum&s;tances which had ei|ther &s;lipped his memory, or e&s;caped his ob&s;er|vation; and that it is owing to the judicious animadver&s;ions of &s;ome other of his ingenious friends, that the&s;e &s;heets do not appear with all their original imperfections.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Done&s;chingen, <DATE>July 21, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am now at Done&s;chingen, in my way towards Swi&s;&s;erland; a country long celebrated for the peculiari|ties of its different governments, and for the &s;ingular beauties conferred upon it by nature. As both the&s;e circum|&s;tances cannot fail of being highly in|tere&s;ting to any one, who has the lea&s;t degree of curio&s;ity; I propo&s;e to my|&s;elf great &s;atisfaction in this tour: not without &s;ome regret, however, that
<PB N="2" REF="10">
our time for this expedition is extreme|ly limited, and that we &s;hall not be able to vi&s;it as much as I could wi&s;h of &s;o delightful a country. But as it is always one's intere&s;t, not &s;o much to regret what we cannot have, as to make the mo&s;t of what is in our power; I &s;hall endeavour to gain all the in|formation, which the &s;hortne&s;s of the time will admit: and, if it will not be tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon your patience, I pro|po&s;e to trouble you with &s;ome account of my tour; writing however, only when it may be convenient to me, and with|out promi&s;ing that you will find me a very punctual corre&s;pondent. I am per|&s;uaded, that I &s;hall travel with much greater profit to my&s;elf, when I am thus to inform you of all that I have &s;een; as the reflection that my ob&s;ervations are to be communicated to you, will be one means of rendering me more attentive and accurate in forming them.</P>
<P>We quitted Stra&s;bourg ye&s;terday, and cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine to Kehl, formerly an
<PB N="3" REF="11">
important fortre&s;s belonging to Stra&s;|bourg when an imperial city. It was al&s;o &s;trongly fortified by the French, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in 1648; but it was ceded to the Empire at the peace of Ry&s;wic: the Emperor con&s;igned it over to the hou&s;e of Baden, re&s;erving, however, to him&s;elf the right of having a garri&s;on therein. Since that period, it has been twice be&s;ieged by the French; and as during the la&s;t &s;iege, in 1733, the works were con&s;iderably da|maged, the imperial garri&s;on has been withdrawn: at pre&s;ent, there are only the ruins of the ancient fortifications; and by way of garri&s;on, a few invalids belonging to the Margrave of Baden. From thence we proceeded to Offen|bourg, a &s;mall imperial town; and &s;oon after, entered the beautiful valley of Kin&s;ing; pa&s;&s;ed through Gengenbach, another &s;mall imperial town, finely &s;ituated; and went up the valley along the cour&s;e of the river Kin&s;ing; ri&s;ing
<PB N="4" REF="12">
gradually for &s;everal leagues together, until we found our&s;elves in the mid&s;t of the Black Fore&s;t. As we a&s;cended, the country became more wild and ro|mantic, and the river more rapid; on each hand mountains, who&s;e &s;ides were finely cultivated, and who&s;e tops were richly covered with a continual fore&s;t. Several &s;mall &s;treams of the cleare&s;t water rolled down the &s;ides of the mountains, forming numberle&s;s little ca&s;cades in their pa&s;&s;age; and uniting, fell into the Kin&s;ing. The views were &s;o exceedingly diver&s;ified; the villages &s;o delightfully &s;ituated; and the cot|tages &s;o exceedingly picture&s;que, that we almo&s;t imagined we had antici|pated the romantic beauties of Swi&s;&s;er|land.</P>
<P>Done&s;chingen is the principal re&s;i|dence of the prince of Fur&s;tenberg: in the court-yard of his palace, the Danube takes its ri&s;e. I am this mo|ment returned from vi&s;iting the &s;pot:
<PB N="5" REF="13">
the de&s;cription of which may be com|pri&s;ed in a few words. Some &s;mall &s;prings ri&s;ing from the ground, form a ba&s;on of clear water, of about thirty foot &s;quare: from this pool i&s;&s;ues the Danube, being at fir&s;t nothing more than a little brook. And though the two &s;mall rivers of Bribach and Brege, uniting below the town, are far more con&s;iderable than this &s;tream, which flows into them &s;oon after their junc|tion; yet it is the latter that alone has the honour of being called the &s;ource of the Danube, and gives name to the other two. After we had gone through the ceremony of &s;triding acro&s;s the &s;tream, in order to &s;ay, that we had <HI>&s;tepped</HI> over the Danube, we &s;oon &s;a|tisfied our curio&s;ity; the object it&s;elf being in no re&s;pect extraordinary, but deriving its principal recommendation from being one of the &s;ources of &s;o con&s;iderable a river. Indeed, it was this circum&s;tance alone that induced
<PB N="6" REF="14">
us to enter Swi&s;&s;erland by the way of Suabia.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Schaffhau&s;en, <DATE>July 22.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE great plea&s;ure in breathing the air of liberty: every per&s;on here has apparently the mien of content and &s;atisfaction. The cleanline&s;s of the hou&s;es, and of the people, is peculiarly &s;triking; and I can trace in all their manners, behaviour, and dre&s;s, &s;ome &s;trong outlines, which di&s;tingui&s;h this happy people from the neighbouring nations. Perhaps it may be prejudice and unrea&s;onable partiality; but I am the more plea&s;ed, becau&s;e their fir&s;t ap|pearance very much reminds me of my
<PB N="7" REF="15">
own countrymen, and I could almo&s;t think, for a moment, that I am in England.</P>
<P>Schaffhau&s;en is a neat and tolerably well-built town, &s;ituated upon the northern &s;hore of the Rhine. It is the capital of the canton of the &s;ame name, and owes its origin to the interruption of the navigation of that river by the cataract at Lauffen: huts were at fir&s;t con&s;tructed here for the convenience of unloading the merchandize from the boats; and the&s;e huts, by degrees, en|crea&s;ed to a large town. Schaffhau&s;en was formerly an imperial city, and was governed by an ari&s;tocracy: it pre&s;erved its liberties, which were attacked by the Dukes of Au&s;tria, by entering into an alliance with &s;everal other imperial towns, and with the Swi&s;s cantons. In 1501, it was admitted a member of the Helvetic confederacy; being the twelfth canton in rank. Of all the cantons, it is the lea&s;t in &s;ize, being only five leagues in
<PB N="8" REF="16">
length and three in breadth: its popu|lation is &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to twenty|five thou&s;and &s;ouls; of which, the ca|pital contains about &s;ix thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The whole number of citizens or burge&s;&s;es (in whom the &s;upreme power ultimately re&s;ides) is, I am informed, about &s;ixteen hundred. They are di|vided into twelve tribes: and from the&s;e are elected eighty-five members, who form the &s;overeign council, con&s;i&s;ting of a great and little council. To the&s;e two councils combined, the admini&s;tra|tion of affairs is committed: the &s;enate, or little council of twenty-five, being entru&s;ted with the executive power; and the great council, compri&s;ing the &s;e|nate, finally deciding all appeals, and regulating the more important concerns of government.</P>
<P>The revenues of the &s;tate ari&s;e, partly from the tythes, and other articles of the like nature; but principally from the duties laid upon the merchandi&s;e, which
<PB N="9" REF="17">
pa&s;&s;es from Germany: and I am inform|ed, that the&s;e cu&s;toms are nearly &s;uffi|cient to defray all the public expences. The&s;e, indeed, are not very con&s;idera|ble, as will appear from the &s;alary of the burgoma&s;ter, or chief of the republic; which barely amounts to &pound;.150 <HI>per ann.</HI> The reformation was introduced here in 1529: the clergy are paid by the &s;tate, but their income is literally not &s;ufficient for their maintenance; the be&s;t living being only about &pound;.100, and the wor&s;t &pound;.40 <HI>per ann.</HI> The pro|fe&s;&s;ors of literature al&s;o, who are taken from the clergy, are paid likewi&s;e by government; and a public &s;chool is &s;up|ported at the expence of the &s;ame. Sump|tuary laws are in force here, as well as in mo&s;t parts of Swi&s;&s;erland; and no dancing is allowed, except upon particular oc|ca&s;ions: &s;ilk, lace, and &s;everal other ar|ticles of luxury, are prohibited; even the ladies head-dre&s;&s;es are regulated. How would &s;uch Gothic ordinances
<PB N="10" REF="18">
be received in England? they would &s;erve at lea&s;t to lower the price of feathers. But what is of &s;till greater importance, all games of hazard are &s;trictly prohibited; and in other games the party who lo&s;es above &s;ix florins (about nine &s;hillings of our money) incurs a con&s;iderable fine. An ex|cellent regulation! and I was inform|ed, that the&s;e laws are not, like ours of the &s;ame kind, mere cyphers, but are well ob&s;erved. The principal article of exportation is wine; of which they make a large quantity, the country abound|ing in vineyards: and as the canton furni&s;hes but little corn, they procure it from Suabia in exchange for their wine. In the town there are &s;ome, but not very con&s;iderable, manufactures of linen, cotton, and &s;ilk: their commerce, however, is very flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>It will perhaps give you &s;ome idea of the &s;ecurity of the Swi&s;s cantons, when I tell you, that Schaffhau&s;en, although a
<PB N="11" REF="19">
frontier town, has no garri&s;on; and that the fortifications are but &s;light. The ci|tizens mount guard by turns; and the people of the canton being divided into regular companies of militia, which are exerci&s;ed yearly, are always ready and prepared to take up arms in defence of their country. This canton has &s;ome troops in the &s;ervices of France, Sar|dinia, and Holland; the only foreign &s;ervices into which the &s;ubjects of the Prote&s;tant cantons enli&s;t.</P>
<P>Before I take my leave of this city, I mu&s;t not omit mentioning the famous bridge over the Rhine; ju&s;tly admired for the beauty and &s;ingularity of its ar|chitecture. The river is extremely ra|pid, and had already de&s;troyed &s;everal bridges of &s;tone, built upon arches of the &s;tronge&s;t con&s;truction; when a car|penter of Appenzel undertook to throw a wooden one, of a &s;ingle arch, acro&s;s the river, which is near three hundred feet wide. The magi&s;trates, however,
<PB N="12" REF="20">
in&s;i&s;ted, that it &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of two arches, and that he &s;hould make u&s;e for that purpo&s;e of the middle pier of the old bridge, which remained entire. Accord|ingly, the architect was obliged to obey; but he has contrived it in &s;uch a manner, that the bridge is not at all &s;upported by the middle pier: and it would certainly have been equally &s;afe, and con&s;idera|bly more beautiful, had it con&s;i&s;ted &s;olely of one arch. But how &s;hall I attempt to give you an idea of it? I, who am totally un&s;killed in architecture, and who have not the lea&s;t knowledge of drawing. Take however the following de&s;cription, and excu&s;e its inaccuracy:</P>
<P>It is a wooden bridge, of which the &s;ides and top are covered, and the road over it is almo&s;t perfectly level: it is what the Germans call a haengewerk, or hanging bridge; the road not being carried, as u&s;ual, over the top of the arch; but, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, is let down into the middle of it, and
<PB N="13" REF="21">
there &s;u&s;pended. The middle pier is not ab&s;olutely in a right line with the &s;ide ones, that re&s;t upon the &s;hore; as it forms with them a very obtu&s;e angle pointing down the &s;tream, being eight foot out of the linear direction: the di&s;tance of this middle pier from the &s;hore that lies towards the town, is one hundred and &s;eventy-one feet, and from the other &s;ide, one hundred and ninety-three; in all, three hundred and &s;ixty-four feet; making in appearance two arches of a &s;urprizing width, and form|ing the mo&s;t beautiful per&s;pective imagi|nable when viewed at &s;ome di&s;tance. A man of the &s;lighte&s;t weight walking upon it, feels it tremble under him; and yet waggons heavily laden pa&s;s over it without danger: and although in the latter in&s;tance, the bridge &s;eems almo&s;t to crack with the pre&s;&s;ure, it does not appear to have ever &s;uffered the lea&s;t damage. It has been compared, and very ju&s;tly, to a tight rope, which
<PB N="14" REF="22">
trembles when it is &s;truck, but &s;till pre|ferves its firm and equal ten&s;ion. I went under this bridge, clo&s;e to the middle pier, in order to examine its mechani&s;m; and though not the lea&s;t of a mechanic, I could not help being &s;truck with the elegant &s;implicity of the architecture: I was not capable of de|termining whether it re&s;ts upon the middle pier, but mo&s;t judges agree that it does not.</P>
<P>When one ob&s;erves the greatne&s;s of the plan, and the boldne&s;s of the con|&s;truction, one is a&s;toni&s;hed that the ar|chitect was a common carpenter, with|out the lea&s;t proficiency in learning, totally ignorant of mathematics, and not at all ver&s;ed in the theory of me|chanics. The name of this extraordi|nary man was Ulric Grubenman, an ob&s;cure drunken fellow of Tuffen, a &s;mall village in the canton of Appenzel. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of uncommon natural abilities, and a &s;urpri&s;ing turn for the practical
<PB N="15" REF="23">
part of mechanics, he rai&s;ed him&s;elf to great eminence in his profe&s;&s;ion; and may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t ingenious architects of the pre&s;ent century. This bridge was fini&s;hed in le&s;s than three years, and co&s;t ninety thou&s;and florins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>About &pound;.8000 &s;terling. Mr. Andreae, in his Letters upon Swi&s;&s;erland, has given two engrav|ings of this bridge, to which he has added a very accurate de&s;cription of its mechanical con&s;truc|tion, communicated to him by Mr. Jetzler of Schaffhau&s;en. In this de&s;cription he con&s;iders it as con&s;i&s;ting of two arches, and repre&s;ents the bridge as re&s;ting upon the middle pier; but I have been a&s;&s;ured by &s;everal per&s;ons of very re|&s;pectable authority, who &s;aw it &s;oon after it was built, that the bridge, when it was fir&s;t con|&s;tructed, did not even touch the pier in que&s;tion; and &s;ince that time, that there has been a wedge driven in by order of the magi&s;trates. As a proof, if indeed any &s;uch proof be wanted, that the architect could have &s;ucceeded in con&s;tructing the bridge without the aid of the middle pier; his brother, John Grubenman, no le&s;s eminent than the other, built about the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame &s;tile of architecture, a bridge over the Rhine at Reichenau, in the Gri&s;ons, which is two hundred and forty feet long, and is but of one arch. And what would have been &s;till more ex|traordinary, Ulric Grubenman had agreed to throw a bridge of a &s;ingle arch, and of the &s;ame con|&s;truction, over the river Derry in Ireland. The river is &s;ix hundred feet wide, which, by means of abutments, was to have been reduced to four hundred; it was to have co&s;t &pound;.20,000, but the plan was not carried into execution for want of proper encouragement.</P>

precipice which overhangs the Rhine, we looked down perpendicularly upon the cataract, and &s;aw the river tumbling over the &s;ides of the rock with amazing violence and precipitation. From hence we de&s;cended till we were &s;omewhat be|low the upper bed of the river, and &s;tood clo&s;e to the fall; &s;o that I could almo&s;t have touched it with my hand. A &s;caffolding is erected in the very &s;pray of this tremendous cataract, and upon the mo&s;t &s;ublime point of view:&mdash;the &s;ea of foam tumbling down&mdash;the con|tinual cloud of &s;pray &s;cattered around at a great di&s;tance, and to a con&s;iderable height&mdash;in &s;hort, the magnificence of the whole &s;cenery far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, and exceeds all de&s;cription. Within about an hundred feet, as it appeared to be, of the &s;caffold|ing, there are two rocks in the middle of the fall, that prevent one from &s;eeing its whole breadth from this point: the neare&s;t of the&s;e was perforated by the
<PB N="18" REF="26">
continual action of the river; and the water forced it&s;elf through in an ob|lique direction, with inexpre&s;&s;ible fury, and an hollow &s;ound. After having continued &s;ome time, contemplating in &s;ilent admiration the awful &s;ublimity of this wonderful land&s;cape, we de&s;cended; and below the fall we cro&s;&s;ed the river, which was exceedingly agitated.</P>
<P>Hitherto I had only viewed the cata|ract &s;ideways; but here it opened by degrees, and di&s;played another picture, which I enjoyed at my lei&s;ure, as I &s;at my&s;elf down upon the oppo&s;ite bank. The mo&s;t &s;triking objects were as fol|low: on the &s;ide we came from, a ca&s;tle, erected upon the very edge of the pre|cipice, and overhanging the river; near it, a church and &s;ome cottages; on the &s;ide where I was &s;itting, a clump of cottages clo&s;e to the fall; in the back ground, ri&s;ing hills, planted with vines, or tufted with hanging woods; a beau|tiful little hamlet upon the &s;ummit,
<PB N="19" REF="27">
&s;kirted with trees; the great body of water, that &s;eemed as it were to ru&s;h out from the bottom of the&s;e hills; the two rocks above mentioned boldly ad|vancing their heads in the mid&s;t of the fall, and in the very point of its &s;teepe&s;t de&s;cent, their tops covered with &s;hrubs, and dividing the cataract into three principal branches. The colour of the Rhine is extremely beautiful, being of a clear &s;ea-green; and I could not but remark the fine effect of the tints of green, when blended with the white foam in its de&s;cent. There is a plea&s;ing view from an iron foundery clo&s;e to the river, which is dammed up, in order to prevent its carrying away the works and neighbouring cottages: by means of this dam a &s;mall portion of the river, in its fall, enters a trough, turns a mill, and forms a beautiful little &s;ilver current, gliding down the bare rock, and de|tached from the main cataract. Below the fall the river widens con&s;iderably
<PB N="20" REF="28">
into a more ample ba&s;on; at the fall, the breadth, as well as I could judge by my eye, &s;eemed to be about two hundred and fifty feet. As to its perpendicular heighth, travellers differ: tho&s;e who are given to exaggeration reckon it an hun|dred feet high; but I &s;hould imagine about fifty feet will be nearer the truth. I &s;tood for &s;ome time upon the brink of the cataract; beheld in admiration, and li&s;tened in &s;ilence; then cro&s;&s;ed the river, re-mounted my hor&s;e, and re|turned to Schaffhau&s;en.</P>
<P>Some writers have a&s;&s;erted that the river precipitates it&s;elf in one &s;heet of water; and, as I before ob&s;erved, from a perpendicular heighth of an hundred feet. In former ages this account was probably agreeable to fact; as it is imagined, that the &s;pace between the two banks was once a level rock, and con&s;iderably higher; that the river has in&s;en&s;ibly worn away, and undermined tho&s;e parts, on which it broke along
<PB N="21" REF="29">
with the utmo&s;t violence: for, within the memory of &s;everal of the inhabitants of this town, a large rock has given way, that has greatly altered the view. Indeed I am convinced that the per|pendicular heighth of the fall becomes le&s;s and le&s;s every year, by the con|tinual friction of &s;o large and rapid a body of water; and have no doubt but that the two rocks, which now ri&s;e in the mid&s;t of the river, will in time be undermined and carried away. The river, for &s;ome way before the fall, even near the bridge, da&s;hes upon a rocky bottom, and renders the navigation im|po&s;&s;ible for any kind of ve&s;&s;el. A few weeks ago a countryman of ours tried an experiment with a &s;mall boat, which he contrived to have gently pu&s;hed to the edge of the cataract: it &s;hot down entire to the bottom of the fall, was out of &s;ight for a few moments, and then ro&s;e up again da&s;hed into a thou|&s;and &s;plinters.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY morning we quitted Schaffhau&s;en, and cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Die&s;&s;enhoffen, a &s;mall town in Thurgovy; a country dependent upon the eight antient cantons: from thence to Stein the road lay by the &s;ide of that river. Stein is an independent town under the protection of Zuric, but governed by its own laws and ma|gi&s;trates. At this place we took a boat to carry us to Con&s;tance. A little above the town of Stein the river widens con&s;iderably, and forms the in|ferior lake of Con&s;tance, or the Zeller See; which is divided into two branches: from Stein to Con&s;tance is about &s;ix|teen miles, and from the latter to Zell, its greate&s;t breadth, about ten.</P>
<P>A fine breeze &s;oon carried us to the i&s;land of Reichenau, which is under
<PB N="23" REF="31">
the &s;overeignty of the thirteen cantons: it is about three miles long, and one broad; contains about &s;ixteen hundred inhabitants, all Catholics; three pa|ri&s;hes; one village; and a rich abbey of Benedictines, of which the bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance is abbot. The &s;uperior was exceedingly civil, and &s;hewed us all the relics and curio&s;ities of the convent: among the latter, was a rotten tooth of Charles Le Gros. That monarch, who was emperor and king of France, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed dominions as exten|&s;ive as tho&s;e of Charlemain, lived to want the common nece&s;&s;aries of life, and to depend for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence upon the charity of an archbi&s;hop of Mentz. He was publicly depo&s;ed in 887, at a meeting of the principal French, Ger|man, and Italian barons, whom he him&s;elf had &s;ummoned: after hav|ing langui&s;hed a year, in extreme want and mi&s;ery, he died, and was buried in this convent. The next remarkable
<PB N="24" REF="32">
curio&s;ity, was an emerald, as it is called, of an extraordinary &s;ize, which, according to the annals of the convent, was a pre&s;ent from Charlemain. Take its dimen&s;ions, and then judge whether it can be an emerald: it has four un|equal &s;ides; the longe&s;t of which is near two feet, and the broade&s;t about nine inches; it is one inch thick, and weighs about twenty-nine pounds. The &s;uperior valued it at fifty thou&s;and florins; but if it be, as I conjecture, nothing more than a tran&s;parent green fluor-&s;pathus, its value will be reduced to a few florins. Upon our return to the inn, where we dined, we found a pre&s;ent from the &s;uperior, which we valued more than all the relics and cu|rio&s;ities of his convent; two bottles of excellent wine, the growth of the i&s;land, which indeed is almo&s;t one continued vineyard.</P>
<P>In the evening we arrived at Con|&s;tance: its &s;ituation upon the Rhine,
<PB N="25" REF="33">
between the two lakes, is mo&s;t delight|ful. I was much &s;truck with the &s;oli|tary appearance of a town once &s;o flouri&s;hing in commerce, and formerly &s;o celebrated in the annals of hi&s;tory. There was a dead &s;tillne&s;s throughout; gra&s;s growing in the principal &s;treets; in a word, it wears the melancholy a&s;pect of being almo&s;t totally de&s;erted: and upon enquiry, I found there were &s;carcely three thou&s;and inhabitatns. This city has met with a &s;ad rever&s;e of fortune: it was formerly in alliance with Stra&s;bourg, Zuric, Ba&s;il, &amp;c.; and, &s;upported by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Zuric and Berne, had driven out the bi&s;hop, and embraced the reformation. But the Prote&s;tant cantons being wor&s;ted in 1351; and the league of Smalcade, of which Con&s;tance was a member, being defeated by Charles V. the town was obliged to &s;ubmit to the emperor, and to re-admit the Catholic religion. From this period it lo&s;t its independence;
<PB N="26" REF="34">
and being neglected by the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, it fell by degrees into its pre|&s;ent almo&s;t annihilated &s;tate; and ex|hibits to &s;ome of the neighbouring Swi&s;s cantons, an in&s;tructive contra&s;t, which cannot but the more &s;en&s;ibly endear to them their own invaluable happine&s;s, in the commerce and liberties they enjoy.</P>
<P>We paid a vi&s;it to the chamber where the council of Con&s;tance was held in 1415, and had the honour of &s;itting in the two chairs, in which &s;at pope John XXIII<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was depo&s;ed in this council.</NOTE>. and the emperor Sigi&s;mond; if any honour can be derived from a turbulent eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and a perjured &s;overeign. It was by a &s;entence of this council, that the celebrated reformer John Hu&s;s (having embraced the doc|trines of our Wickliffe, and tru&s;ting to the &s;afeguard of the emperor, who vio|lated his word) was burnt as an heretic. They &s;hew the hou&s;e in which he was &s;eized, and upon which his head, carved
<PB N="27" REF="35">
in &s;tone, but now almo&s;t defaced, is fixed; with an in&s;cription under it in German. Jerome of Prague, his di&s;|ciple, had the weakne&s;s to recant be|fore the &s;ame council; but this weak|ne&s;s was amply compen&s;ated by the greatne&s;s of &s;oul with which he again retracted this recantation, and by the calm and intrepid magnanimity which he &s;hewed in his la&s;t moments at the &s;take. From the top of the cathedral we had a &s;uperb view of the town, which is now &s;carce a third of its an|tient extent; of the two lakes; with the rugged Alps of Tyrol and Ap|penzel, their tops covered with per|petual &s;now.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t returned from a plea&s;ant expedition to the &s;mall i&s;land of Mei|nau, in a bay of the &s;uperior lake: this i&s;land, about a mile in circum|ference, belongs to the knights of the Teutonic order. The bailiff &s;hewed us the hou&s;e of the commander, which
<PB N="28" REF="36">
is prettily &s;ituated, and has a fine pro&s;|pect of the lake, but contains nothing remarkable. The garden might have been well laid out by a judicious hand at a very &s;mall expence: but the man who planned it, took it into his head to hide the view of the lake; which, af|ter much co&s;t, he has at length unhap|pily effected by means of high and cut hedges! the hone&s;t gardener did not forget to expatiate on the merit of this <HI>curious</HI> contrivance. The cellars of this ca&s;tle are well &s;tocked with wine; an article from whence the chief revenue of the commandery ari&s;es. Our good friend the bailiff was very free in offer|ing it to us; and we, not to appear in&s;en&s;ible of his civility, were con&s;trained to ta&s;te of &s;everal different &s;orts, which he pre&s;ented, one after the other, al|ways prai&s;ing the la&s;t as the olde&s;t and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite. The wine was in|deed excellent, the gla&s;&s;es large, and a mo&s;t formidable row of enormous ca&s;ks
<PB N="29" REF="37">
&s;till remained unta&s;ted; &s;o that, after having duly extolled &s;everal &s;pecimens, we found it expedient to decline the farther &s;olicitations of our generous ho&s;t: for, had we gone through the whole ceremony, we &s;hould mo&s;t pro|bably have taken up our abode in the ca&s;tle for this night.</P>
<P><DATE>July 25.</DATE></P>
<P>We &s;et &s;ail about two hours ago from Con&s;tance. This &s;uperior lake, or, as it is &s;ometimes called, the Boden See, is about fifteen leagues in length and &s;ix in its greate&s;t breadth: it is one of the great boundaries that &s;e|parate Swi&s;&s;erland from Germany. The borders on each &s;ide con&s;i&s;t of gen|tly ri&s;ing hills; on the left hand Suabia, and on the right Thurgovy, with a va|riety of towns, villages, and mona&s;te|ries, &s;cattered about: the form of the lake inclines to an oval, and the water is of a greeni&s;h hue. I am now writ|ing aboard the ve&s;&s;el, and have been for &s;ome time in vain attempting to
<PB N="30" REF="38">
di&s;tingui&s;h (what &s;ome travellers have affirmed to be di&s;cernable) the waters of the Rhine from tho&s;e of the lake: though indeed I was before almo&s;t con|vinced of the impo&s;&s;ibility. For, the river in its cour&s;e from the &s;uperior lake, being exactly of the &s;ame beauti|ful greeni&s;h colour as the inferior lake into which it flows; it is evident that the one can never be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other. Probably, upon its fir&s;t en|trance into the &s;uperior lake it is trou|bled, and con&s;equently, for &s;ome way, its current may ea&s;ily be traced: but it purifies by degrees, and becomes an indi&s;tinct part of the great body of water.</P>
<P>This lake is con&s;iderably deeper in &s;ummer than in winter; owing to the fir&s;t meltings of the &s;now from the neighbouring mountains: it abounds in fi&s;h of all &s;orts, and contains two &s;pecies, which are peculiar to it&s;elf, and are taken only three months in the year.
<PB N="31" REF="39">
Ye&s;terday evening in our expedition to Meinau, there was &s;carce a breeze &s;tir|ring, and the lake was as &s;mooth as chry&s;tal: a bri&s;k gale has now rai&s;ed a fine curl upon the &s;urface; and the &s;ur|rounding land&s;cape forms an a&s;&s;emblage of the mo&s;t beautiful objects imagina|ble. In &s;hort, the &s;everal views which pre&s;ent them&s;elves are &s;o truly enchant|ing, that I regret every moment that my eyes are called off from the delightful &s;cene around me. You will not wonder therefore, if I am tempted to bid you adieu &s;omewhat abruptly.</P>

<P>I WRITE to you from the mid&s;t of the Alps, under the &s;hade of a grove of beeches, while a clear &s;tream
<PB N="32" REF="40">
of water, flowing at my feet, forms a natural ca&s;cade down the rock. I have ju&s;t made a hearty meal upon &s;ome bread and chee&s;e; which I found to be a mo&s;t delicious repa&s;t, after having well earned it, by walking near &s;ix miles over the mountains of Appenzel.</P>
<P>We this day quitted St. Gallen, where being a&s;ked a mo&s;t extravagant price for the hire of &s;ix hor&s;es, by tho&s;e who thought we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily take them upon their own terms, we deter|mined not to &s;ubmit to the impo&s;ition; but to walk to Appenzel, and &s;end our baggage by the hor&s;e-road: but (not to a&s;cribe the whole merit of this heroic re&s;olution altogether to oecono|my) I mu&s;t tell you at the &s;ame time, that we were informed beforehand, that the foot-way was by much the mo&s;t agreeable. Nor do I in the lea&s;t re|pend of having made the experiment: for, the beauty and &s;ingularity of the road through which we pa&s;&s;ed has more
<PB N="33" REF="41">
than compen&s;ated for any fatigue of the journey. The country is &s;ingu|larly wild and romantic; con&s;i&s;ting of a continued &s;eries of vallies, with ranges of mountains, who&s;e tops are crowned with the mo&s;t luxuriant pa&s;|tures I ever beheld. I could not have conceived it po&s;&s;ible, without having been an eye-witne&s;s, that any di&s;trict within the &s;ame compa&s;s could have ex|hibited &s;o numerous a population; the hills and vales being &s;trewed thick with hamlets, &s;cattered at a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other; and they are exactly placed too in the very &s;pots which a man of ta&s;te would have fixed upon. The picture&s;que mountains, the fore&s;ts, the currents which we pa&s;&s;ed, over bridges re&s;embling tho&s;e I have &s;een in &s;ome of the be&s;t land&s;capes, added to the beauty of the &s;cenes, and diver&s;ified with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing objects every &s;tep we took. After having repo&s;ed for a &s;hort time in this delightful &s;pot, I
<PB N="34" REF="42">
cannot employ my&s;elf more to my &s;ati&s;|faction than by giving you a continu|ation of my journal.</P>
<P>I took my leave of you, in my la&s;t, upon the lake of Con&s;tance: we landed at Ro&s;hach, a &s;mall town in the dominions of the abbot of St. Gallen, delightfully &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of a bay at the edge of the lake, and at the bottom of a ri&s;ing hill, richly covered with wood and pa&s;turages. From Ro&s;hach we went to St. Gallen, who&s;e whole ter|ritory does not exceed a league and an half in circumference: the town contains &s;even thou&s;and inhabitants; its environs two. Every thing here was alive; all wore the appearance of indu&s;try and activity; exhibiting a &s;trik|ing oppo&s;ition to Con&s;tance, which we had ju&s;t quitted.</P>
<P>The abbot and town of St. Gallen are both allies of the Swi&s;s cantons, and each have the peculiar privilege of &s;end|ing deputies to the general diet: I call
<PB N="35" REF="43">
it <HI>peculiar,</HI> becau&s;e none of the other allies, (except Bienne and Mulhau&s;en) enjoy the &s;ame. The abbot of St. Gal|len is titular prince of the Empire, and is cho&s;en by &s;eventy-two Dominican monks, belonging to the abbey, out of their number. He formerly po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed the &s;overeignty of the town; but the inhabitants &s;hook off his authority, and became independent: and although, &s;ince that period, various di&s;putes have ari&s;en between the two rival parties; they have been at different times com|promi&s;ed by the interpo&s;ition of the Swi&s;s cantons. The town is entirely Prote&s;tant, and its government ari&s;to|democratical: the &s;ubjects of the ab|bot (who&s;e territory is very exten&s;ive, and who&s;e power ab&s;olute) are mo&s;tly Catholics. It is remarkable, that the abby in which the prince re&s;ides, is &s;itu|ated clo&s;e to the town, and in the mid&s;t of its territory; as that of the latter is al&s;o entirely &s;urrounded by the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions of the former.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="44">
The town owes its flouri&s;hing &s;tate to the uncommon indu&s;try of the inha|bitants, and to a very exten&s;ive com|merce, ari&s;ing chiefly from its manufac|tures of linen, mu&s;lin, and embroidery. In a place &s;o entirely commercial, I was a&s;toni&s;hed to find the arts and &s;ciences cultivated, and literature in the highe&s;t e&s;teem. In the library there are thir|teen volumes in folio, containing ma|nu&s;cript letters to and from &s;everal of the fir&s;t German and Swi&s;s reformers. Luther ends a letter to Melancthon as follows:
<Q><L>Pe&s;tis eram vivus, moriens ero, mors tua, Papa.</L></Q>
The&s;e letters would probably throw a new light on the hi&s;tory of the refor|mation.</P>
<P>The library belonging to the ab|bey is very numerous and well ar|ranged; and, among a number of monki&s;h manu&s;cripts, contains &s;everal cla&s;&s;ic ones, which engaged my chief
<PB N="37" REF="45">
attention. In this library, Petronius Arbiter, Silvius Italicus, and Valerius Flaccus were found in 1413, and copies di&s;per&s;ed: it was formerly very rich in curious manu&s;cripts; but &s;everal were borrowed during the council of Con&s;tance, by the cardinals and bi&s;hops, who never returned them.</P>
<P>The tran&s;ition from the abbot of St. Gallen to the canton of Appenzel will not appear abrupt, as the latter once belonged to the former: the inhabitants, however, being loaded with exorbitant and oppre&s;&s;ive taxes, revolted in 1400, and maintained their independence with the de&s;perate courage of a &s;pirited people, who fight for their liberties. In 1452 they entered into a perpetual alliance with &s;ome of the neighbouring Swi&s;s republics; and in 1513 were admitted into the Helvetic confederacy: they hold the la&s;t rank among the thirteen can|tons.</P>
<P>Before the reformation the whole can|ton was under one government; but
<PB N="38" REF="46">
&s;ince that period, part of the inhabi|tants having embraced the Prote&s;tant religion, and the other part continuing Catholics, violent di&s;putes were kindled between them; which, after much con|te&s;t, were at length compromi&s;ed. By an agreement in 1597, the canton was divided into two portions; Rhodes Ex|terior, and Rhodes Interior: it was &s;tipulated, that the former &s;hould be appropriated to the re&s;idence of the Pro|te&s;tants, and the latter to that of the Catholics. Accordingly the two parties finally &s;eparated, and formed two repub|lics; their government, police, finances, &amp;c. being totally independent of each other. Each di&s;trict &s;ends a deputy to the general diet: the whole canton, however, has but one vote, and lo&s;es its &s;uffrage if the two parties are not unanimous. In both divi&s;ions the &s;ove|reign power is ve&s;ted in the people at large; every male, who is pa&s;t &s;ixteen, having a vote in their general a&s;&s;embly, held yearly for the creation of their
<PB N="39" REF="47">
magi&s;trates and the purpo&s;es of legi&s;la|tion: and each voter is obliged to appear armed on that particular occa&s;ion. The Landamman is the fir&s;t magi&s;trate: in each di&s;trict there are two, who admi|ni&s;ter the office alternately, and are confirmed yearly. They have each a permanent council, in which all juri&s;|diction in civil and criminal cau&s;es is lodged, together with the care of the police, the management of the finances, and the general admini&s;tration of affairs. The Landamman regent pre&s;ides; and the other, during the year in which he is out of office, is banneret or chief of the militia.</P>
<P>The Rhodes Exterior is much larger, and more peopled in proportion, than the Interior; and the Prote&s;tants are in ge|neral more commercial and indu&s;trious than the Catholics.&mdash;The former are &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to thirty-&s;even thou&s;and; the latter to twelve thou&s;and: a con&s;iderable number, in a &s;mall canton
<PB N="40" REF="48">
of about &s;ixty &s;quare leagues, entirely mountainous, and of which a great part con&s;i&s;ts of barren and inacce&s;&s;ible rocks. But the indu&s;try of the inhabitants amply compen&s;ates for any di&s;advantages of &s;oil: for the people are frugal and laborious, their property is a&s;&s;ured, and they are exempted from all burden&s;ome and arbitrary taxes. The&s;e circum|&s;tances, joined to their right of partak|ing of the legi&s;lation, and of electing their magi&s;trates, in&s;pire them with &s;uch animated &s;entiments of their own im|portance and independence, as excite the mo&s;t active and vigorous indu&s;try: and tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries to which this indu&s;try is not &s;ufficient, are abundantly &s;upplied by their neighbours, in exchange for their manufactures and other articles of their dome&s;tic commerce. The chief part of the habitable country con&s;i&s;ts in rich pa&s;tures; and of cour&s;e their principal exports are cattle and hides, together with chee&s;e and butter: their manufac|tures
<PB N="41" REF="49">
are linen and thread; of both which they make a con&s;iderable quan|tity, and for the &s;upport of which the canton furni&s;hes flax in great abun|dance.</P>
<P>There are no inclo&s;ed towns in this canton; it contains only two or three open burghs, as they are called, (of which Appenzel is the large&s;t in the Catholic, and Heri&s;au in the Pro|te&s;tant, di&s;trict) together with a few &s;mall villages: but indeed the whole country, except among&s;t the barren rocks, is almo&s;t a continued village, co|vered thick as it is with excellent cot|tages, which have the mo&s;t beautiful effect imaginable. Each cottage has its little territory, con&s;i&s;ting generally of a field or two of fine pa&s;ture ground, and frequently &s;kirted with trees: of the latter there is great plenty, the moun|tains being for the mo&s;t part beautifully wooded; and the canton is &s;upplied with water in &s;uch exuberance, that we
<PB N="42" REF="50">
could hardly walk two hundred paces without &s;eeing a &s;pring i&s;&s;uing from the ground, or perhaps a torrent ru&s;hing down the &s;ides of a rock.</P>
<P>In our way to Appenzel, we entered &s;everal of their hou&s;es, which are all built of wood; neatne&s;s and convenience be|ing the principal object of the owners: and &s;uch a remarkable cleanline&s;s pre|vailed throughout, as afforded me a mo&s;t &s;triking proof of the general at|tention this people pay to that e&s;&s;ential article. A continued chain of the&s;e cultivated mountains, richly cloathed with wood, and &s;tudded all over with hamlets, (which one would almo&s;t ima|gine had been placed by the genius of ta&s;te in the very &s;pots where they would have the mo&s;t &s;triking effect) exhibits a land&s;cape inexpre&s;&s;ibly plea&s;ing: it &s;eem|ed as if they belonged to &s;o many in|dependent clans; independent, but &s;o|cial, and uniting for the great purpo&s;es of legi&s;lation, and for the general pre|&s;ervation
<PB N="43" REF="51">
of their liberties. The Pro|te&s;tant divi&s;ion contains about ten thou&s;and men capable of bearing arms; and the Catholic about three thou|&s;and.</P>
<P>Among the chief part of the inhabi|tants, the original &s;implicity of the pa&s;|toral life is &s;till pre&s;erved; and I &s;aw &s;everal venerable figures with long beards, that re&s;embled the old patri|archs. I am much mortified that I cannot &s;peak German, which is their language; as that natural frankne&s;s, and particular tone of equality, which ari&s;e from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own independence, could not fail of afford|ing me very intere&s;ting conver&s;ation. As to the &s;tate of literature, my &s;tay here has been &s;o &s;hort, that I cannot form any accurate idea of it; I have only been informed in general, that learning has made its way over the&s;e mountains; and that there are &s;everal men of letters in this canton, who are
<PB N="44" REF="52">
an honour to them&s;elves, and an orna|ment to their country.</P>
<P>In our way to this place we pa&s;&s;ed through Tuffen, the birth-place of Ulric Grubenman, whom I mentioned in a former letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 14.</NOTE>: he has been dead &s;ome years; but his abilities and his &s;kill in practical architecture are, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, hereditary in his family. We enquired for one of the &s;ame name, who was either his brother or his nephew, whom we found at the ale|hou&s;e; his u&s;ual place of re&s;ort when he has no particular employment. He is a heavy, coar&s;e-looking man, dre&s;&s;ed like a common pea&s;ant; has a quick and penetrating eye, and a &s;urpri&s;ing readine&s;s of conver&s;ation. We told him that we were Engli&s;hmen, who were mak|ing the tour of Swi&s;&s;erland; and, as we wi&s;hed to view every thing remarkable in the country, we could not pa&s;s through Tuffen without de&s;iring to &s;ee a man who was &s;o much celebrated for
<PB N="45" REF="53">
his &s;kill in architecture. He &s;truck his brea&s;t, and replied in German, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here you &s;ee but a boor."</Q> Upon our talking with him about the bridge of Schaffhau&s;en, in the building of which he was employed, he a&s;&s;ured us, that it does not re&s;t upon the middle pier, but is in effect a &s;ingle arch. Near Appen|zel we ob&s;erved an old man with vene|rable white hair hanging down over his &s;houlders, who looked like one of our &s;ub&s;tantial farmers: he enquired with a tone of authority, but with perfect civility, who we were; and upon our a&s;king the &s;ame que&s;tion re&s;pecting him|&s;elf, of our guide, we were informed, that he was the <HI>Landamman,</HI> or chief of the republic. Happy people, the nature of who&s;e country, and the con&s;ti|tution of who&s;e government both equal|ly oppo&s;e the &s;tronge&s;t barriers again&s;t the baneful introduction of luxury!</P>

<P>WE are this moment arrived at this place; where we propo&s;e pa&s;&s;ing the night: while &s;upper is pre|paring, I will continue my journal. We could procure but three hor&s;es at Ap|penzel, and as one of them was appro|priated to the baggage, I preferred walk|ing: accordingly I &s;et out by my&s;elf &s;ome time before the cavalcade. After hav|ing walked a league in the canton, through the &s;ame kind of country men|tioned in my la&s;t (a continued range of mountains, enriched with beautiful mea|dows, and dotted thick with cottages) I arrived at its boundary; when the &s;cene &s;uddenly changed into a wild fore&s;t, con|&s;i&s;ting chiefly of pines, without the lea&s;t appearance of any habitation. The road is very &s;ingular. It is in mo&s;t parts not more than three feet broad; and is
<PB N="47" REF="55">
either paved with large uneven pieces of rock, or formed of thick &s;takes laid clo&s;ely together: but as the ground is in many parts &s;ofter than in others, the&s;e &s;takes of cour&s;e in &s;ome places &s;ink deeper, and by this means form an almo&s;t invariable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of uneven &s;teps. The mountain by which we de|&s;cended into the plain, is very &s;teep; which, added to the unevenne&s;s of the &s;takes, makes the a&s;cent and de&s;cent ex|ceedingly difficult for hor&s;es. Tho&s;e who are plea&s;ed with an uniform view, may continue in the plain; while others, who delight in the grand and the &s;ub|lime, and are &s;truck with the wanton|ne&s;s of wild, uncultivated nature, will prefer this road to the &s;moothe&s;t turn|pike in Great Britain.</P>
<P>I walked &s;lowly on, without envy|ing my companions on hor&s;eback: for I could &s;it down upon an inviting &s;port, climb to the edge of a precipice, or trace a torrent by its &s;ound. I de&s;cended
<PB N="48" REF="56">
at length into the Rheinthal, or valley of the Rhine; the mountains of Tyrol, which yielded neither in heighth or in craggine&s;s to tho&s;e of Appenzel, ri&s;ing before me. And here I found a re|markable difference: for although the a&s;cending and de&s;cending was a work of &s;ome labour; yet the variety of the &s;cenes had given me &s;pirits, and I was not &s;en&s;ible of the lea&s;t fatigue. But in the plain, notwith&s;tanding the &s;cenery was &s;till beautiful and picture&s;que, I &s;aw at once the whole way &s;tretching before me, and had no room for fre&s;h expecta|tions: I was not therefore &s;orry when I arrived at Oberried, after a walk of about twelve miles, my coat &s;lung upon my &s;houlder like a peripatetic by pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Here we were lucky enough to procure a narrow open cart; in which, the roads being rough and &s;tony, you will readily believe we were not much at our ea&s;e. The evening however being fine, and the moon exceedingly bright,
<PB N="49" REF="57">
our journey was not altogether unplea|&s;ant; as it led us through a delightful country abounding in vines, in fruit|trees, in flax, and excellent pa&s;turages.</P>
<P>This Rheinthal is a bailliage belong|ing to Appenzel and the eight antient cantons, which alternately appoint a bailiff. The people are indu&s;trious, and manufacture a con&s;iderable quantity of linen, cotton, mu&s;lins plain and em|broidered: they con&s;i&s;t of both reli|gions, but the Prote&s;tants are the mo&s;t numerous.</P>
<P>Wallen&s;tadt, <DATE>July 28.</DATE></P>
<P>We quitted Salets this morning, <HI>in</HI> the &s;ame narrow open cart in which we arrived: and it would have afforded your curio&s;ity matter of &s;ome &s;peculation, to ob&s;erve how we contrived to arrange our|&s;elves, our &s;ervants, a large Newfoundland dog, and the baggage, in &s;o narrow a compa&s;s: indeed we were &s;o wedged in together, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="50" REF="58">
to &s;tir, after we had once fixed our|&s;elves in our &s;everal places. The day was &s;ultry, and the &s;un powerful, the road bad, and the cart went barely at the rate of three miles an hour; but the country &s;till continued &s;o picture&s;que and mountainous, and our attention was &s;o entirely taken up with the per|petual variety of objects it pre&s;ented to our view, as to make us forget the in|conveniences of our equipage, and the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the weather. From Trivabach, a &s;mall village upon the Rhine, we walked to Sargans, the ca|pital of a bailliage of the &s;ame name, belonging to the eight antient cantons.</P>
<P>Let me remark by the way, that in Swi&s;&s;erland there are two &s;orts of bail|liages: the one con&s;i&s;ting of certain di&s;|tricts, into which all the ari&s;tocratical cantons are divided; and over the&s;e a particular officer, called a <HI>bailiff,</HI> is ap|pointed by government, to which he is accountable for his admini&s;tration: the
<PB N="51" REF="59">
other &s;ort are the territories that do not make part of the di&s;tricts of the can|tons, but are &s;ubject to two or more of them, who by turns appoint a bailiff. This officer, when not re&s;trained by the peculiar privilege of certain di&s;tricts, has the care of the police, juri&s;diction in civil and criminal cau&s;es with &s;ome limitations; and has a &s;tated revenue ari&s;ing in different places from different duties and taxes. In ca&s;e of exaction or mal-admini&s;tration, an appeal al|ways lies from the bailiff to the cantons, to which the bailliage belongs: and the place, the time, and the members who receive the appeal, are all regulated with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s. With re&s;pect to this of Sargans, and the others belong|ing to the eight antient cantons con|jointly; at the conclu&s;ion of the ge|neral diet held annually at Frauenfield in Thurgovy, the deputies of the&s;e can|tons re&s;olve them&s;elves into a Syndicate, examine the accounts of the public re|venues
<PB N="52" REF="60">
as delivered in by the bailiffs of the re&s;pective di&s;tricts, and receive and judge all appeals; in &s;ome ca&s;es, finally; but in the more important ones an ap|peal lies from this a&s;&s;embly to the &s;u|perior tribunal of each canton. The theory of this in&s;titution, has a plau&s;ible appearance of impartiality: but how far the practice accords with the theory, I cannot pretend to determine. Whether a bailiff, who is guilty of extortion, is ea&s;ily brought to ju&s;tice, or more ea&s;ily &s;creened? how far the members of the Syndicate are liable to influence, or open to corruption? how far the ex|pence of appeals renders them in many ca&s;es impracticable to the poorer in|habitants? are que&s;tions which cannot be an&s;wered but by a per&s;on far more informed concerning the&s;e courts of ju&s;|tice than I have had an opportunity to be.</P>
<P>We arrived late at the town of Wal|len&s;tadt: it is incorporated into the
<PB N="53" REF="61">
bailliage of Sargans, but enjoys &s;everal di&s;tinct privileges. This little town de|rives its exi&s;tence from being the pa&s;&s;age of the merchandi&s;e tran&s;ported from Germany through the Gri&s;ons to Italy. This communication occa&s;ions the fre|quent re&s;ort hither of Italian mer|chants; and that language is &s;poken by many of the inhabitants: a circum|&s;tance of great &s;atisfaction to me; as from my ignorance of the German I have been frequently much &s;treightened in obtaining all the information I want. Our landlord &s;peaks Italian, and has been very accurate in his an&s;wers to my que&s;tions relating to the number of in|habitants, the government of the town, its dependence upon the bailiff, its pri|vileges, &amp;c. Nor is this to be wondered at: for the innkeepers in Swi&s;&s;erland are mo&s;tly <HI>burge&s;&s;es,</HI> and are frequently <HI>members</HI> of the &s;overeign council; be|&s;ides that, from the very nature of their governments, the Swi&s;s in general are
<PB N="54" REF="62">
well informed of every thing relating to their particular con&s;titutions. I have al&s;o held a long conver&s;ation in the &s;ame language with a burge&s;s of Glaris, who has furni&s;hed me with &s;ome information I can depend upon, in rela|tion to that canton: which we purpo&s;e vi&s;iting to-morrow. I endeavour to a&s;|certain the truth of the&s;e informations, by procuring as many as I can from diffe|rent per&s;ons of all ranks; by laying them together; and then comparing them with the written accounts, if there be any.</P>
<P>Our &s;tay is &s;o &s;hort in mo&s;t of the places we pa&s;s through, that I cannot expect to gain an accurate knowledge of every circum&s;tance I wi&s;h to be ac|quainted with: but, though I may omit many things that are worthy of your curio&s;ity, yet I &s;hall atte&s;t nothing, of the truth of which I am not perfectly convinced. It is the fault of many tra|vellers, to write from what they have read, and not from what they have &s;een,
<PB N="55" REF="63">
and to exaggerate the relations of others: but I promi&s;e you that I will de&s;cribe nothing, of which I have not been an eye-witne&s;s. The remarks I &s;hall tran&s;|mit to you, will be the genuine re&s;ult of my own feelings; and I had even rather be frequently wrong in my &s;en|timents and reflections, than &s;ervilely follow the ob&s;ervations of others. On this you may therefore depend; that though the conclu&s;ions may perhaps be fal&s;e, the facts will certainly be true: and I flatter my&s;elf you will readily par|don any error in judgment, when my in|tention is neither to exaggerate or to de|ceive.</P>
<P>We&s;en, <DATE>July 29.</DATE></P>
<P>The lake of Wallen&s;tadt is about &s;ix|teen miles in length, and two in breadth: it is entirely bounded by exceeding high mountains, except to the ea&s;t and we&s;t. From this &s;ituation, a breeze ge|nerally blows from tho&s;e two quarters, beginning at the break of day, and con|tinuing
<PB N="56" REF="64">
for &s;ome hours; then changes from we&s;t to ea&s;t till &s;un-&s;et: this breeze is very convenient for the tran&s;portation of the merchandi&s;e. Sometimes how|ever a violent north-wind ru&s;hes down from the mountains, and renders the navigation dangerous. We were a&s;|&s;ured by the inhabitants, and by the watermen who rowed us from Wallen|&s;tadt to this place, that the breeze above mentioned was generally con&s;tant: but we cannot atte&s;t it from our own experience; as we &s;et out this morning about eight, and the wind was directly contrary the whole way, blowing from we&s;t to ea&s;t. The weather, 'tis true, was heavy, overca&s;t, and rainy, which might cau&s;e perhaps this occa&s;ional variation.</P>
<P>The lake is uncommonly wild and picture&s;que, and affords a perpetual va|riety of beautiful and romantic &s;cenes. On the &s;ide of Glaris, the mountains which border upon the lake, are chiefly cultivated; enriched with wood; or fine
<PB N="57" REF="65">
meadows; and &s;tudded with cottages, churches, and &s;mall villages; the Alps of Glaris ri&s;ing behind; their tops co|vered with &s;now. On the other &s;ide, for the mo&s;t part, the rocks are exceed|ingly grote&s;que, craggy, inacce&s;&s;ible, and perpendicular: but here and there a few cultivated necks of land are formed at the very edge of the lake, and at the bottom of the&s;e very rocks; exhibiting a beautiful contra&s;t to the barrenne&s;s above and around them. Numberle&s;s water-falls, occa&s;ioned by the meltings of the &s;nows, fall down the &s;ides of the&s;e rocks from a very con&s;iderable heighth, and with an almo&s;t inconceiv|able variety; &s;ome of them &s;eeming to glide gently in circular directions; others forming va&s;t torrents, and ru&s;h|ing into the lake with noi&s;e and vio|lence: all of them changing their form and their po&s;ition as we approached or receded from them. The lake is ex|ceedingly clear, deep, and cold, and, as we were informed, never freezes.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="66">
There is nothing remarkable in this place; being a &s;mall village &s;ituated almo&s;t upon the point where the river Linth i&s;&s;ues from the lake of Wallen|&s;tadt: that little river is joined by the Limmat, and falls into the lake of Zuric.</P>

<P>THE canton of Glaris was for|merly &s;ubject to the abbe&s;s of the convent of Seckinguen in Suabia: the people however enjoyed very con&s;ider|able privileges, and a democratical form of government, under the admini&s;tra|tion of a mayor, appointed by the ab|be&s;s, but cho&s;en among the inhabitants. Towards the latter end of the thirteenth century, the emperor Rodolph I. ob|tained the exclu&s;ive admini&s;tration of
<PB N="59" REF="67">
ju&s;tice; and not long afterwards his &s;on Albert, having purcha&s;ed the mayoralty, which had in&s;en&s;ibly become hereditary, re-united in his per&s;on the whole civil and judicial authority. Accordingly that prince, and his immediate de&s;cendents the dukes of Au&s;tria, oppre&s;&s;ed the people, and ruled over them with an ab&s;olute &s;way. In 1350, Schweitz, a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by Zuric, Lucerne, Uri, and Underwalden, expelled the Au&s;trians from the country of Glaris, re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed the democracy, and re&s;tored li|berty to the people. Glaris now en|tered into a perpetual alliance with its deliverers, and was received into the Helvetic confederacy with &s;ome re&s;tric|tions, which were not aboli&s;hed until 1450. At that time it was the &s;ixth canton, but is now the la&s;t in rank of the eight <HI>antient</HI> cantons, as they are called; being &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, becau&s;e, from the acce&s;&s;ion of Zug and Berne in 1352, more than a century elap&s;ed be|fore
<PB N="60" REF="68">
a new member was admitted. The&s;e <HI>antient</HI> cantons have al&s;o &s;everal privileges &s;uperior to the five others; the latter having &s;ubmitted to &s;ome par|ticular re&s;trictions, upon their being received into the Helvetic league.</P>
<P>The people of Glaris enjoyed their liberties unmole&s;ted till 1388, when the Au&s;trians made an irruption into the canton, with a force &s;ufficient, as they arrogantly thought, totally to &s;ubdue it; pillaging the country, and ma&s;|&s;acring the inhabitants. It was then that three hundred and fifty troops of Glaris, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by thirty Switzers, re|&s;i&s;ted the whole &s;trength of the Au&s;trian army: the former were po&s;ted advan|tageou&s;ly upon the mountains, and the latter, to the number of fifteen thou|&s;and, at a village called Naefels. In this &s;ituation the Au&s;trians began the attack; but were &s;oon compelled to re|treat with great precipitation, by a &s;hower of &s;tones poured upon them
<PB N="61" REF="69">
from the heighths: in this moment of confu&s;ion, the inhabitants ru&s;hed down upon the enemy with &s;uch redoubled fury, that they broke their ranks; and, having made an immen&s;e &s;laughter, forced the remainder to retire from the canton. The&s;e &s;urpri&s;ing victories, gained by a handful of men again&s;t an enemy &s;o much &s;uperior in number (in|&s;tances of which are by no means rare in the hi&s;tory of Swi&s;&s;erland) render the wonderful combats of Marathon and Plataea, when the Greeks repul&s;ed the numerous ho&s;ts of the whole Per&s;ian em|pire, perfectly credible. The &s;ame love of independence, the &s;ame dread of &s;la|very, and the &s;ame attachment to their country, animated the re&s;pective na|tions to the &s;ame deeds of heroi&s;m; and in both in&s;tances victory was fol|lowed by the &s;ame glorious con&s;equence: for the Swi&s;s, as well as the Greeks, owe the ri&s;e and pre&s;ervation of their liberties to that magnanimous and de|termined
<PB N="62" REF="70">
valour which prefers death to living under the &s;ervile domination of an arbitrary de&s;pot. The people &s;till cele|brate the anniver&s;ary of this victory, which in&s;ured their independence for ever: and I &s;aw near the village of Naefels &s;everal &s;tones, with no other in&s;cription than 1388: an in&s;cription which no more requires explanation, to an inhabitant of the canton, than the glorious aera of 1688, to an Eng|li&s;hman.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixteenth century, the refor|mation was introduced into this canton, but not exclu&s;ively: both religions are tolerated, and the two &s;ects live together in the greate&s;t harmony. This union is the more remarkable, when we con|&s;ider the fatal quarrels that have been kindled in Swi&s;&s;erland on account of religious tenets; and that in Appenzel the divi&s;ion between the two &s;ects is di&s;tinctly marked by their inhabiting different di&s;tricts, and living under &s;epa|rate
<PB N="63" REF="71">
governments. In &s;everal parts of this canton, the Prote&s;tants and Catho|lics perform &s;ervice in the &s;ame church, one after the other; and all the offices of &s;tate are amicably admini&s;tered by the two parties. During the pre&s;ent and the preceding century, the Prote&s;|tants have encrea&s;ed con&s;iderably in number, and their indu&s;try, in every branch of commerce, is greatly &s;uperior: an evident proof how much the bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition of the church of Rome fetters the genius, and depre&s;&s;es the powers of exertion.</P>
<P>The government is entirely democra|tical: every per&s;on of the age of &s;ixteen has a vote in the <HI>Land&s;gemeind,</HI> or ge|neral a&s;&s;embly, which is annually held in an open plain. This a&s;&s;embly rati|fies new laws, lays contributions, enters into alliances, declares war, and makes peace. The <HI>Landamman</HI> is the chief of the republic, and is cho&s;en alternately from the two &s;ects; with this difference,
<PB N="64" REF="72">
that the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> remains three years in office, the <HI>Catholic</HI> only two. The man|ner of election is as follows: five can|didates are cho&s;en by the people, and the&s;e draw lots for the charge. The other great officers of &s;tate, and the bailiffs, are taken al&s;o by lot from a certain number of candidates propo&s;ed by the people. The executive power is ve&s;ted in the council of regency, com|po&s;ed of forty-eight Prote&s;tants, and fifteen Catholics: each &s;ect has its par|ticular court of ju&s;tice; and, when there is any proce&s;s between two per&s;ons of different religions, the ca&s;ting voice among the five or nine judges, who are to determine the cau&s;e, is always of the &s;ame religion as the defendant.</P>
<P>Cattle, chee&s;e, and butter, con&s;titute the principal commerce of the canton. The cattle are fed in &s;ummer upon the Alps: and it is computed that ten thou&s;and head of large cattle, and four thou&s;and &s;heep, are pa&s;tured during that
<PB N="65" REF="73">
&s;ea&s;on upon the mountains belonging to this canton. There are al&s;o &s;ome manufactures of linen; and the inha|bitants make a con&s;iderable quantity of thread.</P>
<P><DATE>July 30.</DATE></P>
<P>I am ju&s;t returned to Glaris, after having made an excur&s;ion towards the extremity of the canton: it is entirely enclo&s;ed by the alps, except towards the north; and there is no other entrance but through this open|ing, which lies between the lake of Wallen&s;tadt and the mountains &s;e|parating the canton of Glaris from that of Schweitz. Foot-pa&s;&s;engers in|deed may in &s;ummer traver&s;e the&s;e alps to the Gri&s;ons on one &s;ide, and to Uri|on the other: but the&s;e paths, which even in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer are barely pa&s;&s;able, are in winter ab&s;olutely im|practicable. At the entrance above|mentioned, the canton reaches, from the banks of the Linth to the farthe&s;t
<PB N="66" REF="74">
extremity of its alps, about thirty miles; forming a valley, which becomes nar|rower as you advance, and is &s;carcely more than a mu&s;ket-&s;hot in breadth at the burgh of Glaris. It afterwards opens by degrees; and about a league from the la&s;t-mentioned burgh is divi|ded by the Freyberg mountains: at the point of this divi&s;ion the two rivers, Limmat and Sernft, unite.</P>
<P>We continued through the large&s;t of the&s;e vales; which, though very narrow, is exceedingly populous. You have been at Matlock in Derby&s;hire, and I remember your admiration of its beau|tiful and romantic &s;ituation: the &s;cenery of this vale is of the &s;ame ca&s;t, but in|finitely more picture&s;que, more wild, more varied, and more &s;ublime. The Limmat is much broader and more ra|pid than the Derwent; and the hillocks of the Peake (for I may &s;o call them comparatively) are mere mole-hills to the alps of Glaris. The&s;e &s;tupendous
<PB N="67" REF="75">
chains of rocks are ab&s;olutely perpendi|cular, approach one another &s;o near, and are &s;o high, that the &s;un may be &s;aid to &s;et, even in &s;ummer, at four in the afternoon. On each &s;ide are numbers of tho&s;e water-falls we had been &s;o &s;truck with during our pa&s;&s;age over the lake of Wallen&s;tadt; one in particular, near the village of Ruti, that foamed down the &s;teep &s;ides of a mountain, from the mid&s;t of a hanging grove of trees. I was &s;o captivated with the&s;e enchanting &s;cenes, that I could not help &s;topping every moment to admire them: as often as I did &s;o, our guide, not conceiving it po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e delays could be owing to any other cau&s;e than the lazine&s;s of his hor&s;e, never failed to &s;trike the poor bea&s;t; and continually awakened me out of my rapturous contemplations. As I could not &s;peak to be under&s;tood in German, it was &s;ome time before I could make him comprehend by &s;igns,
<PB N="68" REF="76">
that I &s;topped by choice, and wi&s;hed to go my own pace. After having rode about ten miles, we quitted our hor&s;es and walked. Near Leugelbach, a con|&s;iderable rivulet is formed at once by two &s;treams, bur&s;ting from the ground at the foot of a mountain, which af|ter a few paces unite, and fall into the Limmat: be&s;ides the&s;e two principal branches, there are &s;everal other &s;maller ones, together with numberle&s;s little fountains that gu&s;h from the rock.&mdash;The clearne&s;s of the &s;treams; their rapidity and murmuring &s;ound; the trees that hang over the point from whence they i&s;&s;ue; the rude rocks above; the rich meadows and the &s;cattered hamlets around&mdash;all together form an a&s;&s;em|blage of the mo&s;t lively and plea&s;ing objects that ever entered into a beau|tiful land&s;cape.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed the Limmat &s;everal times, which runs through the valley with all the violence of a torrent; and
<PB N="69" REF="77">
came at length to an amphitheatre of mountains, where the vale ended: on our right-hand a fall more con&s;iderable than any we had yet &s;een, tumbling down perpendicularly a bare rock in a large body of water; the alps on each &s;ide crowned with inacce&s;&s;ible fore&s;ts, and covered with everla&s;ting &s;now; be|fore us a pyramidical mountain, bare and craggy; and the glaciers of Glaris clo&s;ing the view. Here the vale, and the habitable part of the canton, ter|minate. We then quitted the plain, and a&s;cending through a wild fore&s;t of beech and pines, continued more than an hour mounting a very &s;teep and rugged path, till we came to the Panten-Bruck, a bridge over the cata|ract that forms the Limmat, which is here called the Sand-bach: it roars from the glacier down the &s;teep mountain in one unbroken fall; and, a little way be|fore its arrival under the bridge, works it&s;elf a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age through
<PB N="70" REF="78">
the rock, where it is lo&s;t only to ap|pear again da&s;hing out with increa&s;ed violence and precipitation. This bridge is a &s;ingle arch of &s;tone, of about &s;eventy feet in length, thrown over a precipice of above three hundred feet in depth. It &s;erves as a communication with the upper alps, and is the pa&s;&s;age for the cattle which are fed there during the &s;ummer months: on the other &s;ide &s;ome goats came jumping around us, and &s;eemed to welcome us to their dreary habitations. The&s;e mountains are co|vered with a va&s;t variety of rare herbs, and beautiful &s;weet-&s;cented flowers, which made me regret that I had not pur&s;ued my botanical &s;tudies. As I leaned upon the parapet of the bridge, and looked down into the cha&s;m be|neath, my head almo&s;t turned giddy with the heighth. The rock, down which the Sand-bach drives, is compo&s;ed of &s;late, of which there is a great quantity in this canton: the principal mine is
<PB N="71" REF="79">
in the valley of Sernft, where they make large &s;labs that &s;erve for tables, and which form a con&s;iderable article for exportation. After we had continued &s;ome time admiring the &s;ublime hor|ror of the &s;cenery, we de&s;cended into the vale, and made a hearty meal upon &s;ome excellent bread, honey, butter, and milk, which a neighbouring cottage &s;upplied us with. As the canton al|mo&s;t entirely con&s;i&s;ts of rich meadows, the milk and butter are delicious; and the honey of the&s;e mountainous coun|tries is mo&s;t exqui&s;ite. Nothing de|lights me &s;o much as the in&s;ide of a Swi&s;s cottage: all tho&s;e I have hitherto vi&s;ited, convey the livelie&s;t image of clean|line&s;s, ea&s;e, and &s;implicity; and cannot but &s;trongly impre&s;s upon the ob&s;erver a mo&s;t plea&s;ing conviction of the pea|&s;ant's happine&s;s.</P>
<P>If I had never &s;een the&s;e little de|mocratical &s;tates, I could have formed no idea of the general equality and in|di&s;tinction
<PB N="72" REF="80">
that prevails among the in|habitants. All the hou&s;es, like tho&s;e of Appenzel, are built of wood; large, &s;olid, and compact, with great pent|hou&s;e roofs that hang very low, and extend beyond the area of the founda|tion. This peculiar &s;tructure is of u&s;e to keep off the &s;now; and, from its &s;ingularity, accords &s;urpri&s;ingly with the beautiful wildne&s;s of the country. The hou&s;es of the richer inhabitants in the principal burghs, are of the &s;ame ma|terials: the only difference con&s;i&s;ts in their being larger.</P>
<P>If that &s;ort of government be con|fe&s;&s;edly the be&s;t, which con&s;titutes the greate&s;t good of the greate&s;t number in the community; the&s;e little &s;tates, not|with&s;tanding the natural defects of a democratical con&s;titution, may ju&s;tly claim a large &s;hare of our approbation. General liberty, general independence, and an exemption from arbitrary taxes, are ble&s;&s;ings which amply compen&s;ate
<PB N="73" REF="81">
for a want of tho&s;e refinements that are introduced by opulence and luxury. However, it is only in the&s;e &s;mall re|publics, and in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;ociety, that this kind of general democracy can have place; where there are not any per&s;ons &s;o rich as to gain an undue a&s;cendency over the people by large&s;&s;es; and where, if they err in their councils, it is an error of the judgment and not of the heart. When a general corruption of the latter prevails, the evil is incurable, becau&s;e the laws cannot reach it. In de|mocracies, the machine of government is con&s;iderably indeed clogged by that variety of wheels required to put it in|to motion; but at the &s;ame time, it is not nece&s;&s;ary here that its motions &s;hould be &s;udden and expeditious, as there is no fear of an inva&s;ion from without, and as the people have no con|que&s;ts either to make or to defend; their principal policy con&s;i&s;ting in maintaining their independence, and in pre&s;erving the public tranquillity.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="82">
The police is well regulated through|out Swi&s;&s;erland; and even in the&s;e de|mocratical &s;tates, liberty does not dege|nerate into licentiou&s;ne&s;s: we may ex|cept, perhaps, the day of their general a&s;&s;emblies, when it is impo&s;&s;ible to pre|vent &s;ome degree of confu&s;ion in a meeting, where there is &s;carcely any di&s;tinction of per&s;ons, and where every pea&s;ant con&s;iders him&s;elf as equal to the fir&s;t magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>Our ho&s;t is an open-hearted, hone&s;t Swi&s;s: he brings his pint of wine with him, &s;its down to table with us, and chats without the lea&s;t ceremony. There is a certain forwardne&s;s of this kind which I cannot bear, when it ap|parently is the effect of impertinent curio&s;ity, or fawning officiou&s;ne&s;s; but the pre&s;ent in&s;tance of frank familiarity, ari&s;ing, as it evidently does, from a mind con&s;cious of its natural equality, and uncon&s;trained by arbitrary di&s;tinc|tions, is highly plea&s;ing to me; as I

<P>WE could not pa&s;s through this part of the country, without making a pilgrimage to Ein&s;idlin, and paying our re&s;pects to this celebrated &s;hrine: an object of much devotion among the Catholics. Ein&s;idlin, or Notre Dame des Hermites, is a rich and magnificent abbey of Benedictines in the canton of Schweitz, which owes its celebrity to the miraculous image, as it is called, of the Virgin Mary. The ridiculous tales they relate of the origin and aggrandi&s;ement of this ab|bey, are &s;o many melancholy in&s;tances of the credulity of the darker ages:
<PB N="76" REF="84">
that they are &s;till believed in the pre|&s;ent enlightened century, mu&s;t be at|tributed to the force of habitual preju|dice; and at the &s;ame time proves, how difficult it is for the human mind to &s;hake off tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titious errors, which it has early imbibed under the &s;anctified name of religion.</P>
<P>In the ninth century a certain her|mit called Meinrad, was the fir&s;t who retired to this place, where he built a chapel, and was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by rob|bers. But &s;hall I tell you, or (what is more to the purpo&s;e) will you be|lieve me if I tell you, that this mur|der was di&s;covered by two crows, who followed the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to Zuric, where they were &s;eized and executed? Soon after this the dead body of St. Mein|rad mu&s;t of cour&s;e work miracles; and all the world pilgrimi&s;es to his bones. The &s;anctity of this place being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;ome one (for whether it were St. Benno or St. Eberhard, or
<PB N="77" REF="85">
what other &s;aint I cannot preci&s;ely de|termine) built another chapel, which he dedicated to the Virgin, and laid the fir&s;t foundation of the abbey; having bequeathed for that purpo&s;e all his fortune: and the pious fund was &s;oon con&s;iderably augmented by &s;ub&s;equent donations. Shall I tell you al&s;o that in 948, Conrad bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance, as he was going to con&s;ecrate the cha|pel, heard a voice from heaven, a&s;&s;ur|ing him, that God him&s;elf had con&s;e|crated it? Whatever was its origin, and whoever was its founder; crouds of pilgrims re&s;ort hither from all quarters to adore the Virgin, and to pre&s;ent their offerings: and it is computed, that upon the mo&s;t moderate calcula|tion, their number amounts yearly to 100,000. The circumjacent country was formerly one continued fore&s;t, which &s;ince the erection of the abbey has been gradually converted into rich pa&s;tures and beautiful meadows: and
<PB N="78" REF="86">
this is a miracle which the Virgin, in a certain &s;en&s;e, may truly be &s;aid to have performed.</P>
<P><DATE>Augu&s;t 1.</DATE></P>
<P>I have ju&s;t been vi&s;iting the abbey, the chapel of the Virgin, and her im|men&s;e trea&s;ures. The church of the abbey is a large and magnificent build|ing, but exhibits a remarkable &s;pecimen of fal&s;e ta&s;te, by being loaded with bad paint|ings, and &s;uperfluous ornaments. In the i&s;le not far from the entrance is a &s;mall and elegant marble chapel of the Corin|thian order: this is the celebrated &s;hrine of the Virgin, to which the pilgrims re&s;ort. On the out&s;ide an angel &s;up|ports the following in&s;cription:
<Q><L>Hic e&s;t plena remi&s;&s;io peccatorum omnium a culp&aacute; et poen&acirc;.</L></Q>
Over the door is a plate of &s;ilver with five holes, into which I &s;aw &s;everal per|&s;ons thru&s;ting their fingers, and praying at the &s;ame time with great fervour:
<PB N="79" REF="87">
upon enquiry I found, that the credu|lous people believed the&s;e holes to be the marks of God's fingers. In the in|&s;ide of this chapel is the image of the Virgin, which vies with the lady of Lo|retto both in <HI>beauty</HI> of countenance and richne&s;s of apparel; her face, as well as that of the child &s;he holds in her arms, being black. She is richly dre&s;&s;|ed, and every week &s;he changes her gar|ment; her wardrobe con&s;i&s;ting of fifty-two different &s;uits.</P>
<P>The riches of the trea&s;ury are immen&s;e; containing an infinite number of offerings of gold, &s;ilver, and precious &s;tones, arrang|ed in the mo&s;t ridiculous manner imagi|nable. There were al&s;o &s;kulls and bones richly ornamented; whole &s;keletons of &s;aints in ma&s;querade, and of ladies with ruffles, fly-caps, and &s;plendid apparel as if dre&s;&s;ed for a ball. What a wretch|ed in&s;ult upon poor human nature! I could not help con&s;idering them with a mixture of pity and indignation, as
<PB N="80" REF="88">
the offerings of ignorance before the &s;hrine of bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition. The miracles which the Virgin has wrought in this country are infinite, if we may judge from the prodigious number of figures of ears, eyes, legs, arms, heads, &amp;c. pre&s;ented by tho&s;e, who fancied them&s;elves re&s;pectively cured in tho&s;e &s;everal members, by the power of this wonder-working image.</P>
<P>I was glad however to find, in the mid&s;t of this &s;uper&s;titious trumpery, a good library, which contained &s;ome very fine editions of the cla&s;&s;ics.</P>
<P>In this place there is a con&s;iderable traffic carried on, of ro&s;aries, cro&s;&s;es, little images, &amp;c.; and there are rows of &s;hops, where nothing is to be pur|cha&s;ed but the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary appendages of the Roman catholic religion: it has all the appearance of a fair. There is al&s;o a room in the abbey, where the &s;ame kind of merchandi&s;e is expo&s;ed to &s;ale; and one of the friars attends to
<PB N="81" REF="89">
receive your money, and very gravely a&s;&s;ures you, that the &s;everal articles have touched the &s;acred image. Among other curio&s;ities of this kind, I pur|cha&s;ed two ribands, for two pence each, with the following in&s;cription upon them: <HI>Ce Ruban entier, e&s;t la longueur; ju&s;qu'au trait e&s;t l'epai&s;&s;eur, de l'image de notre dame des hermites. Il a touch&eacute; l'image miraculeu&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Is it credible, that in this enlightened age, the mo&s;t notorious &s;uper&s;tition and impo&s;ture can appear thus barefaced? I mu&s;t confe&s;s that the&s;e impo&s;itions rai&s;e my indignation: and, though it <Q REND="inline">"exceeds all power of face"</Q> to keep one's countenance at their glaring ab|&s;urdity; yet every friend to true religion cannot at the &s;ame time but feel &s;en&s;i|bly &s;hocked, to &s;ee the purity of genuine chri&s;tianity thus &s;hamefully di&s;gui&s;ed and pro&s;tituted.</P>
<P>This abbey (con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixty Bene|dictines that elect the abbot, who is
<PB N="82" REF="90">
titular prince of the empire) is very rich, and has con&s;iderable revenues in the canton of Zuric.</P>
<P>Rapper&s;chwyl, <DATE>Augu&s;t 2.</DATE></P>
<P>The evening, ye&s;terday, being fine and cool, I walked from Ein&s;idlin to this place. After we had a&s;cended about three miles, a fine view of the lake of Zuric, and of the adjacent country, opened upon us at once. The pro|&s;pect was exten&s;ive and beautiful: the &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s of the evening, the calmne&s;s of the lake, and the tints of the &s;etting &s;un, which glowed around the hori&s;on, very much improved its charms. When we arrived at the lake, the moon began to ri&s;e; and, throwing its beams acro&s;s the water, formed another &s;cene, more mild indeed, but not le&s;s affecting. We then cro&s;&s;ed the bridge of Rap|per&s;chwyl, built over the narrowe&s;t part of the lake: it mea&s;ured near 1700 paces. The town is plea&s;antly &s;ituated
<PB N="83" REF="91">
upon a neck of land or promontory, that juts out into the lake. It for|merly put it&s;elf under the protection of Uri, Schweitz, Underwalden, and Gla|ris, with a re&s;erve of all its privileges: but the&s;e cantons &s;hamefully oppre&s;&s;ing the inhabitants, and encroaching upon their liberties; Zuric and Berne took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town in 1712, and re|&s;tored to them their antient rights. From that period Rapper&s;chwyl has been under the protection of Zuric, Berne, and Glaris; the latter having pre&s;erved its right by its neutr lity. By this treaty the town recovered its former prerogatives; and the inhabitants, in te&s;timony of their gratitude, have placed the following in&s;cription over the gates: <HI>Amicis Tutoribus floret libertas.</HI> They are all Catholics.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY we dined luxuriou&s;ly with the Capuchin friars at Rap|per&s;chwyl, who &s;eldom regale their gue&s;ts in &s;o &s;umptuous a manner. It was one of their great fea&s;t-days; and accordingly they gave us every po&s;&s;ible variety of fre&s;h-water fi&s;h, with which the lake and the neighbouring rivers abound. The convent is built upon the edge of the water, and commands from &s;ome of the apartments a very agreeable pro&s;pect: the library is by far the plea&s;ante&s;t room, though not the mo&s;t frequented. The cells of the monks are &s;mall, and yet not inconvenient; but cleanline&s;s does not &s;eem to con&s;titute any part of their mo|ral or religious ob&s;ervances. Indeed the very habit of the order is ill calculated for that purpo&s;e, as they wear no &s;hirt or &s;tockings, and are clothed in a coar&s;e
<PB N="85" REF="93">
kind of brown drugget robe, which trails upon the ground. Strange idea of &s;anctity! as if dirt could be accept|able to the Deity. I reflected with par|ticular &s;atisfaction, that I was not born a member of the Roman Catholic church; as perhaps the commands of a parent, a &s;udden di&s;appointment, or a momentary fit of enthu&s;ia&s;m, might have &s;ent me to a convent of Ca|puchins, and have wedded me to dirt and &s;uper&s;tition for life.</P>
<P>After dinner we took leave of our ho&s;ts, and departed for Zuric by wa|ter: the lake is near ten leagues in length, and one in breadth. This body of water is not near &s;o large as that of Con|&s;tance; but the borders are &s;tudded thicker with villages and towns: and as we approached Zuric, the edges of the lake were &s;kirted with a continued range of villas, which being intermixed among vineyards and pa&s;ture-grounds, produced a mo&s;t plea&s;ing effect. The ad|jacent country is finely cultivated and well
<PB N="86" REF="94">
peopled; and the &s;outhern part of the lake appears at &s;ome little di&s;tance bounded with the high &s;tupendous mountains of Schweitz and Glaris: the &s;cenery all to|gether is picture&s;que, lively, and diver|&s;ified.</P>
<P>Zuric was formerly an imperial city, and obtained from the emperor Frederic II. very con&s;iderable privileges; which were acknowledged and augmented by &s;everal of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The civil war between the magi&s;trates and the people, in 1335, was very near reducing the city to ruins; but the former being ba|ni&s;hed, the citizens, in 1337, e&s;tabli&s;hed a new form of government, which was confirmed by the emperor Louis of Ba|varia. The exiles, after &s;everal fruitle&s;s attempts, were at length re-admitted; but it being di&s;covered that they had engaged in a con&s;piracy again&s;t the citi|zens, they were all of them put to death. In con&s;equence of this tran&s;action, the nobles in the neighbourhood took up arms again&s;t the town: the latter, after
<PB N="87" REF="95">
having applied ineffectually for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the emperor Charles IV. entered into an alliance with the four cantons Lu|cerne, Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden, and was admitted a member of their confederacy. This event happened in the year 1351. The four cantons yielded the pre-eminence to Zuric: which privilege it enjoys at pre&s;ent; be|ing the fir&s;t canton in rank, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in extent both of ter|ritory and power next to Berne. The &s;ame year in which Zuric entered into this alliance, &s;he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the four cantons above-mentioned, again&s;t Albert duke of Au&s;tria, who be&s;ieged the town, and was repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Zuric was the fir&s;t town in Swi&s;&s;er|land, that &s;eparated from the church of Rome; being converted by the argu|ments of Zuingle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of all the reformers (the mild and elegant Melancthon alone excepted) Zuingle &s;eems to me|rit peculiar e&s;teem: he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to a great de|gree, that &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, moderation, and cha|rity, which are the characteri&s;tics of true chri&s;tia|nity; and, amid&s;t all the di&s;putes between the Lu|therans and the reformed churches, was a con&s;tant advocate for peace and reconciliation. He appears i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">eed to have been perfectly free, as well from that narrow bigotry which makes no di&s;tinction between points of the mere&s;t indifference, and objects of the greate&s;t importance; as from that overbearing pride, which, while it violently condemns the opinions of others, a&s;&s;umes to it&s;elf infallibility with re&s;pect to its own. In a word, it was his per&s;ua&s;ion, that, provided chri&s;tians agree in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential arti|cles; they ought meekly to bear with any differ|ence upon &s;ubjects le&s;s uncontrovertible; and which do not nece&s;&s;arily influence morals.</NOTE>. That celebrated
<PB N="88" REF="96">
reformer was born Jan. 1, 1484, at Vildehau&s;en, a &s;mall village in the Toc|kenbourg; and when very young, was appointed curate of Glaris. Even be|fore the publication of the &s;ale of indul|gences by Leo X. which was the more immediate cau&s;e of the reformation, Zuingle had expo&s;ed at Glaris &s;everal &s;uper&s;titions of the church of Rome; and he gained additional credit, by
<PB N="89" REF="97">
preaching at Ein&s;idlin again&s;t vows, pilgrimages, and offerings. After the publication of the &s;ale of indulgences; while Luther was undermining the fa|bric of papal authority in Germany, Zuingle was no le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in Swi&s;|&s;erland. By his zeal and intrepidity, and by the irre&s;i&s;tible force of truth, he gained &s;o many converts at Zuric (where he had been invited to preach) that in 1524 the magi&s;trates aboli&s;hed the ma&s;s, and other Catholic ceremonies, and introduced the reformed religion. The di&s;putes between the two &s;ects were carried on with more temper and mo|deration than is u&s;ual in religious con|trover&s;ies. The change, which had been &s;ome time in agitation, was finally determined by a plurality of voices in the &s;overeign council: and the people readily and chearfully obeyed the deci|&s;ion of their magi&s;trates. The exam|ple of Zuric was &s;oon followed by Berne, Schaffhau&s;en, Ba&s;il, with part of
<PB N="90" REF="98">
Glaris and Appenzel; the other cantons continuing to adhere to the religion of their ance&s;tors. From this period the two religions have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in Swi&s;&s;erland; but that harmony, which had hitherto been pre&s;erved between them, has occa&s;ionally been interrupted. Indeed even &s;o early as the year 1551, religious di&s;putes broke out with &s;o much violence and animo&s;ity, as to oc|ca&s;ion the fir&s;t civil war among the can|tons; in which the Prote&s;tants were defeated, and Zuingle lo&s;t his life at the battle of Cappel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been urged again&s;t Zuingle, as a proof of his per&s;ecuting principles, that he was per|&s;onally engaged in this war again&s;t the Catho|lics. To this it may be an&s;wered, That he had u&s;ed every argument in his power to bring about a reconciliation between the contending par|ties; that he even openly arraigned the impa|tient and turbulent zeal of his fellow-citizens; that he acted in obedience to one of the funda|mental laws of the republic; and that he accom|panied the army by the expre&s;s command of the magi&s;trates.</NOTE>. Since that period
<PB N="91" REF="99">
two other religious wars have been kindled; one in 1656, in which the Catholics gained the advantage; and the other in 1712, when the Prote&s;tants proved victorious. The peace of Araw, which put an end to the&s;e unhappy di&s;|putes, has, it is to be hoped, finally &s;ettled all religious differences. By that treaty, which may be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of code of toleration among the Swi&s;s; the treatment of the Prote&s;tants and Catholics in the common bailliages, is regulated. The fir&s;t article &s;tipu|lates, that in all the provinces, which are &s;ubject to cantons of different reli|gion, there &s;hall be a perfect equality between the two &s;ects, and that they &s;hall both enjoy the &s;ame privileges: to which is added an expre&s;s prohibition to each party not to make u&s;e of any terms of raillery or contempt, in &s;peak|ing of their re&s;pective wor&s;hips.</P>
<P>This canton abounds in corn, wine, and excellent pa&s;tures: it is 40 miles by 30,
<PB N="92" REF="100">
and exceedingly populous; containing about an hundred and fifty thou&s;and &s;ouls; of which there are upwards of twelve thou&s;and in the capital. The &s;overeignty re&s;ides exclu&s;ively in the burge&s;&s;es of the town, con&s;i&s;ting in all of about two thou&s;and; which peculiar re&s;triction ari&s;es from the following cir|cum&s;tance:&mdash;During the earlier ages of the republic, the town being in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of but a &s;mall extent of territory, the citizens of cour&s;e exerci&s;ed the powers of &s;overeignty; and when they afterwards gradually obtained con&s;ider|able acqui&s;itions, either by conque&s;t or purcha&s;e, they &s;till re&s;erved to them|&s;elves this pre-eminence; all their new &s;ubjects being excluded from any &s;hare in the government. This remark will hold good with re&s;pect to the &s;even ari&s;tocratical cantons. I cannot but add, that a very narrow &s;pirit of po|licy reigns throughout mo&s;t of the &s;tates of Swi&s;&s;erland; as they &s;eldom or ne|ver
<PB N="93" REF="101">
make a new citizen. This rule however in &s;ome of the republics is le&s;s &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved than in others. In Zuric indeed the citizens are &s;o te|nacious of their privileges, that (as I was informed by one of their magi&s;|trates) it is now an hundred and fifty years &s;ince they have admitted a new citizen. The burge&s;&s;es, be&s;ides the ad|vantage of electing their magi&s;trates, and of a&s;piring to the admini&s;tration of affairs, enjoy the &s;ole right of com|merce; all &s;trangers, and even &s;ubjects of the canton, being excluded from car|rying on any trade in the city.</P>
<P>The citizens or burge&s;&s;es of Zuric, are divided into thirteen tribes: one of the&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of per&s;ons who do not profe&s;s any trade, and are called the nobles. It is &s;omewhat extraordinary, that in a repub|lic ab&s;olutely commercial, &s;uch a di&s;tinc|tion &s;hould be made; and that commerce &s;hould in any re&s;pect be con&s;idered as a degradation. All the other citizens
<PB N="94" REF="102">
following commerce, or exerci&s;ing any trade, are di&s;tributed among the twelve remaining cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lative authority is ve&s;ted by the burge&s;&s;es in the &s;overeign council of two hundred; con&s;i&s;ting however of two hundred and twelve members drawn from the thirteen tribes, and compri&s;ing the &s;enate or little council. The latter is compo&s;ed of twenty-four tribunes taken equally from twelve of the tribes, and four coun&s;ellors cho&s;en by the tribe of the nobles: to the&s;e are added, twenty coun&s;ellors elected by the &s;ove|reign council; and all the&s;e with the two burgoma&s;ters make fifty members. Half of this little council admini&s;ter the office during &s;ix months; at the end of which they are &s;ucceeded by the other half: the pre&s;ident of each divi&s;ion is one of the burgoma&s;ters, who are both cho&s;en by the &s;overeign council and confirmed annually. They have juri&s;diction in all cau&s;es civil and
<PB N="95" REF="103">
criminal: in the former, when the de|mand is of a certain importance, an appeal lies from the &s;enate to the coun|cil of two hundred; but in criminal, their &s;entence is final, and, when once pa&s;&s;ed, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of obtain|ing any rever&s;al or mitigation. An excellent maxim! provided the judges are cautious and circum&s;pect, and the laws mild: for there is no greater en|couragement to the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, than the frequency of pardons. Such an in&s;titution however ought ne|ce&s;&s;arily to exclude &s;everity of puni&s;h|ment; and could never be admitted in a &s;tate, where by the letter of the law the &s;ame puni&s;hment is inflicted upon him who &s;teals a &s;heep, as upon the man who murders his father.</P>
<P>Great therefore is the power of the &s;enate, con&s;idered in their collective ca|pacity; being ab&s;olute judges in all criminal cau&s;es, guardians of the po|lice, and the &s;elect body of men from
<PB N="96" REF="104">
whom the principal magi&s;trates are cho|&s;en. But, as too great a power of in|dividuals is dangerous in a republic; the &s;everal members of this a&s;&s;embly are liable to be changed: and a revi|&s;ion or confirmation is annually made, in &s;ome in&s;tances by the &s;overeign coun|cil, in others by the particular tribes, to which the &s;enators belong. This an|nual revi&s;ion is a great check to mal|admini&s;tration; and at the &s;ame time prevents the &s;enate from gaining &s;o great an influence, as to be detrimental to the liberties of the people. A burge&s;s is qualified to vote at twenty; is eligi|ble into the &s;overeign council at thirty; and into the &s;enate at thirty-five. By the&s;e wi&s;e regulations, a man mu&s;t have had &s;ome experience in public affairs before he is capable of holding a charge of any con&s;equence. The revenues of government are more than proportion|ate to the expences; which are regu|lated with the &s;tricte&s;t oeconomy. The
<PB N="97" REF="105">
&s;tate is not only without debts, but a &s;aving is yearly made, and depo&s;ited in the public trea&s;ury, for a re&s;ort upon any &s;udden emergency. It was from this fund that the government &s;upport|ed the whole expence of the war in 1712, again&s;t the Catholic cantons, without impo&s;ing any additional tax.</P>
<P>Sumptuary laws, as well as tho&s;e again&s;t immorality, are here well ob|&s;erved. The former indeed may exi&s;t, and be carried into execution even a|mong a people much corrupted; for it may be the policy of government to en|force their ob&s;ervance. But the &s;evere&s;t penalties will not be &s;ufficient to pre|vent crimes of an immoral tendency, amid&s;t a general di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of man|ners: it is the popular principles that can alone invigorate &s;uch laws, and give them their full operation. Among the Romans, the laws again&s;t adultery were &s;evere; and yet where was adultery more practi&s;ed than at Rome? In Zuric it
<PB N="98" REF="106">
is rigorou&s;ly puni&s;hed, without any di&s;|tinction of rank, by fine, by expul&s;ion from office, and by impri&s;onment: but the frequency of this crime is not &s;o much re&s;trained by the penalty annexed to it, as from the general good morals of the inhabitants. Secret crimes can|not be prevented; but it is an evident proof of public virtue, when open breaches of immorality are di&s;counte|nanced. Among their &s;umptuary laws, the u&s;e of a carriage in the town is pro|hibited to all &s;orts of per&s;ons except &s;trangers: and it is almo&s;t inconceiv|able that, in a place &s;o very commercial and wealthy, luxury &s;hould &s;o little pre|vail.</P>
<P>At Zuric there is more of the ori|ginal Swi&s;s &s;pirit of independence, than in any of the large towns of this coun|try. The magi&s;trates, le&s;s influenced by foreign courts, and above corruption, con&s;ult always the real advantage of their canton, and of the Helvetic con|federacy.
<PB N="99" REF="107">
Zuric &s;till pre&s;erves in the general diet a very con&s;iderable &s;way; which &s;he derives more from the opinion entertained of her integrity, than from her power: &s;he is looked up to as one of the mo&s;t independent and upright of the thirteen cantons.</P>
<P>The city of Zuric &s;tands upon a gentle eminence on the northern extre|mity of the lake: a beautiful &s;ituation, and advantageous for commerce. For, by means of the river Limmat, which i&s;&s;ues from the lake, and dividing the town, falls into the Aar; there is a communication with the Rhine. And this advantage has not been neglected; as the trade of the town is very exten|&s;ive. The inhabitants are exceedingly indu&s;trious, and carry on with &s;ucce&s;s &s;everal different branches of manufac|ture; the principal is that of crape. Their chief traffic is with France, Ru&s;|&s;ia, Italy, and Holland.</P>
<P>Since the reformation many per&s;ons
<PB N="100" REF="108">
have flouri&s;hed here eminent for their learning, in all branches of literature: and there is no town in Swi&s;&s;erland, where letters are more encouraged, or where they are cultivated with greater &s;ucce&s;s. I waited this morning upon the celebrated Ge&s;ner, author of the death of Abel, and of &s;everal idyls, which for their delicate and elegant &s;im|plicity are ju&s;tly e&s;teemed. They a|bound with tho&s;e nice touches of ex|qui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, which di&s;cover a mind warmed with the fine&s;t &s;entiments; and love is repre&s;ented in the cha&s;te&s;t co|louring of innocence, virtue, and bene|volence. Nor has he confined his &s;ub|jects merely to the tender pa&s;&s;ion: paternal affection, and filial reverence; gratitude, humanity, in &s;hort every mo|ral duty is exhibited and inculcated in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and affecting manner. He has for &s;ome time renounced poetry in order to take up the pencil; and painting is at pre&s;ent his favourite a|mu&s;ement.
<PB N="101" REF="109">
A treati&s;e which he has publi&s;hed on land&s;cape-painting, &s;hews the elegance of his ta&s;te and the ver&s;a|tility of his genius; while his compo&s;i|tions in both kinds prove the re&s;em|blance of the two arts; and that the conceptions of the poet and of the painter are congenial. I prefer his drawings in black and white, to his paintings; for although the ideas in both are equally beautiful or &s;ublime, his colouring is inferior to his de&s;ign. He is preparing an hand&s;ome edition of his writings in quarto, in which every part of the work is carried on by him|&s;elf: he prints them at his own pri|vate pre&s;s; and is at once both the drawer and engraver of his plates. It is to be lamented that he has renounced poetry; for, while ordinary writers &s;pring up in great plenty; authors of real genius are rare and uncommon. His drawings are &s;een only by a few, and will &s;carcely be known to po&s;terity:
<PB N="102" REF="110">
but his writings are di&s;per&s;ed abroad, tran&s;lated into every language, and will be admired by future ages, as long as there remains any reli&s;h for true pa&s;to|ral &s;implicity, or any ta&s;te for original compo&s;ition. He is plain in his man|ners; open, affable, and obliging in his addre&s;s, and of &s;ingular mode&s;ty: he has nothing of the poet in his appear|ance except in his eye, which is full of &s;en&s;e, fire, and expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We waited al&s;o on Mr. Lavater, a clergyman of Zuric, and celebrated phy|&s;iognomi&s;t, who has publi&s;hed a famous treati&s;e on that fanciful &s;ubject. He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf badly in French; but there was an agreeable warmth and vi|vacity in his countenance and manner, while he conver&s;ed upon his favourite &s;ubject. That particular pa&s;&s;ions have a certain effect upon particular features, is evident to the mo&s;t common ob&s;erver; and it may be conceived, that an ha|bitual indulgence of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions may
<PB N="103" REF="111">
po&s;&s;ibly, in &s;ome ca&s;es, impre&s;s a di&s;|tingui&s;hing mark upon the counte|nance: but that a certain ca&s;t of fea|tures con&s;tantly denotes certain pa&s;|&s;ions; and that by contemplating the former we can infallibly di&s;cover al&s;o the mental qualities of the owner, is an hypothe&s;is liable (I &s;hould think) to &s;o many exceptions, that no general and uniform &s;y&s;tem could be ju&s;tly formed upon it. Neverthele&s;s Mr. Lavater, like a true enthu&s;ia&s;t, carries his theory much farther: for he not only pretends to di&s;cover the characters and pa&s;&s;ions by the features, by the complexion, by the form of the head, and by the motion of the arms; but he al&s;o draws &s;ome inferences of the &s;ame kind even from one's hand-writing. And indeed his &s;y&s;tem is formed upon &s;uch univer&s;al principles, that he applies the &s;ame rules to all animated nature, extending them not only to brutes, but even to in&s;ects. That the temper of a hor&s;e may be di&s;|covered
<PB N="104" REF="112">
by his countenance, will not &s;trike you as any thing ab&s;urd: but did you ever hear before that any quality could be inferred from the phy&s;iognomy of a Bee, or of an Ant? While I give you my opinion thus freely concerning Mr. Lavater's notions, you will readily perceive that I am not one of tho&s;e, who are initiated into the my&s;teries of his art. Nor do I mean to cen&s;ure indi&s;cri|minately the &s;y&s;tem of that celebrated writer: for, notwith&s;tanding the extra|vagance of &s;ome of his tenets, the &s;e|vere&s;t critics allow, that there is a fund of good &s;en&s;e and a variety of fine ob&s;er|vations di&s;per&s;ed throughout his treati&s;e; and that it is one of tho&s;e works, which, to be admired, needs only to be read with attention.</P>
<P>The clergy of Zuric are in general better paid than in the other Prote&s;tant cantons; and among that body there are &s;ome, who are very decently pro|vided for: a circum&s;tance rather un|common in the Reformed or Pre&s;byte|rian churches.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="113">
The public granary, on account of its admirable in&s;titution, de&s;erves to be particularly mentioned. Corn is pur|cha&s;ed by government, and given out to tho&s;e who choo&s;e to buy it, at the common prize; but in &s;ea&s;ons of &s;car|city it is &s;old con&s;iderably cheaper, than it can be bought at the market. The u&s;e of this in&s;titution appeared in the late dearth; when bread, from the dearne&s;s of corn, was &s;old at ten pence the pound, government delivered the &s;ame quantity for four pence.</P>
<P>The ar&s;enal is well &s;upplied with cannon, arms, and ammunition; and contains a re&s;erve of mu&s;kets for thirty thou&s;and men. We &s;aw there, and ad|mired, &s;ome of the two-handed &s;words and weighty armour of the old Swi&s;s warriors; as al&s;o the bow and arrow with which William Tell is &s;aid to have &s;hot the apple off the head of his &s;on.</P>
<P>This canton has a regiment and &s;ome companies in France, a regiment in
<PB N="106" REF="114">
Holland, and &s;ome companies in the &s;ervice of the King of Sardinia. It has long been a que&s;tion how far Swi&s;|&s;erland has been benefited by enli&s;ting her &s;ubjects in foreign armies. But, without entering into that enquiry, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that Zuingle violently de|claimed again&s;t this practice, as intro|ducing a corruption of morals: and he had intere&s;t &s;ufficient to prevent Zuric from joining in the general alliance, which all the Swi&s;s cantons entered into with Francis I. Since that period, Zuric continued firm in her refu&s;als until the reign of Henry IV. when this canton finally acceded to the treaty with that monarch.</P>

<P>WE walked ye&s;terday to Albis, a &s;mall village about three leagues from Zuric, &s;ituated upon the &s;ummit of a &s;teep mountain, which commands a fine view of that town, the lake, and its environs. We were lucky in e&s;cap|ing a violent &s;hower of rain, accom|panied with a &s;torm of thunder and lightning, which had threatened for &s;ome time, and began immediately upon our arrival: but we were well hou&s;ed, and our ho&s;t gave us a good &s;upper and an excellent bottle of Mu&s;cat wine. We were abroad this morning by five, and had a very agreeable walk to this place; the weather, which had of late been very &s;ultry, being cooled by the lightning and rain. We pa&s;&s;ed over the field of battle at Cappel, where
<PB N="108" REF="116">
Zuingle was killed; and continued our way along the fields through a plea&s;ant country, &s;o thickly planted with fruit-trees, that I could hardly di&s;tingui&s;h any other &s;ort. Indeed we had before remarked the prodigious number of tho&s;e trees in &s;everal other parts of Swi&s;&s;er|land, the country being in many places almo&s;t one continued orchard.</P>
<P>Zug, the capital of this canton (and the only walled town among all the po|pular ones) &s;tands delightfully upon the edge of a beautiful lake, in a fertile valley, abounding with corn, pa&s;ture-ground, and fruit-trees. This canton formerly belonged to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and it continued faithful to that family when the other neighbouring &s;tates had formed them&s;elves into independent republics. As it lies between Zuric and Schweitz, the communication between tho&s;e two cantons was kept up with difficulty; and by this means frequent opportuni|ties were afforded to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria
<PB N="109" REF="117">
of invading and harra&s;&s;ing the Swi&s;s. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the &s;ix allied cantons, in 1351, laid &s;iege to Zug, which was re&s;olutely defended by the inhabi|tants; but as Albert duke of Au&s;tria was in no condition to &s;end them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the town at length &s;urren|dered upon the mo&s;t honourable con|ditions. The genero&s;ity of the con|querors was equal to the courage and magnanimity of the vanqui&s;hed: for, in con&s;equence of this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the inhabitants of the canton of Zug were delivered from the yoke of a foreign ma&s;ter, obtained the mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured liberty and independence, and were admitted into the Helvetic confederacy upon equal terms.</P>
<P>The government of this little canton is exceedingly complicated; and the in|habitants of this town have &s;omewhat more influence, and enjoy a greater &s;hare in the admini&s;tration of affairs, than tho&s;e of the capital burghs in the
<PB N="110" REF="118">
five other democratical cantons. The &s;upreme power re&s;ides in the inhabitants of the four di&s;tricts of Zug, Bar, Egeri, and Meutzingen; who a&s;&s;emble yearly (like tho&s;e of Glaris and Appenzel) to enact laws, and to choo&s;e their magi&s;|trates. The Landamman is elected by the &s;uffrages of the whole collective di&s;|tricts, but is taken alternately from each of the four communities above-men|tioned: he continues three years in of|fice, when taken from the di&s;trict of Zug, and but two years when cho&s;en from each of the three others. And there is this peculiar difference between the five other cantons and that of Zug; that, whereas in the former the Landamman, upon the expiration of his office, always retains a con&s;iderable pre-eminence in the council of regency; in the latter, when he quits his charge, he has not the lea&s;t di&s;tinction above any other coun|&s;ellor. The general admini&s;tration of affairs is entru&s;ted to the council of re|gency,
<PB N="111" REF="119">
compo&s;ed of forty members: of which the di&s;trict of Zug furni&s;hes thir|teen, and the others are taken equally from the three remaining communities. This council, as well as the Landamman, re&s;ides always in the capital town.</P>
<P>O&s;wald, one of our old Briti&s;h kings, is the titular Saint of this place; and in the church is his &s;tatue, with the follow|ing in&s;cription: <Q><L>Sanctus O&s;waldus Rex Angliae Patronus hujus Ec|cle&s;iae.</L></Q>
This O&s;wald was (if I remember right) a king of Northumberland in the &s;e|venth century; and is much renowned among the monki&s;h writers for his cha&s;|tity, piety, and power of working mi|racles. I have been endeavouring to make out, what connection a Briti&s;h king, under the heptarchy, could have had with a &s;mall canton of Swi&s;&s;erland; without reflecting how fruitle&s;s is the attempt to give any rea&s;on for ab&s;urd
<PB N="112" REF="120">
cu&s;toms. In the church of Rome, &s;aints are ea&s;ily tran&s;planted into any &s;oil; and caprice, as well as &s;uper&s;tition, may have inclined the inhabitants of Zug to adore a &s;aint, who&s;e name is barely known in his own country.</P>

<P>WE took boat at Zug, and being rowed acro&s;s the lake (which is about three leagues long, and one broad) were landed at a &s;mall village in the canton of Schweitz. From thence we walked to Ku&s;&s;nacht; and in our way pa&s;&s;ed by a &s;mall chapel &s;acred to William Tell, erected on the &s;pot where, it is &s;aid, he &s;hot the Au&s;trian governor. At Ku&s;&s;nacht, we embarked upon the lake of Lucerne; and were much &s;truck
<PB N="113" REF="121">
upon our approach with the fine view of that town, which we thought &s;uperior even to Zuric in the beauty of its &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Lucerne, originally &s;ubject to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, was continually ex|po&s;ed to the inroads of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden; after tho&s;e cantons had &s;ecured their own liberty and inde|pendence. All her commerce to Italy, was by this means interrupted; her fairs unfrequented; and her citizens compelled to be ever in arms, in order to protect their territory from ince&s;&s;ant depredations. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; in&s;tead of giving the citizens any effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, im|prudently loaded them with additional taxes, as exorbitant as they were un|ju&s;t. The con&s;equence was, that Lu|cerne made her peace with the confe|derate cantons; and, having &s;oon after driven out the Au&s;trian party, entered into a perpetual alliance with Uri, Schweitz,
<PB N="114" REF="122">
and Underwalden, and became a mem|ber of the Helvetic confederacy.</P>
<P>The acce&s;&s;ion of Lucerne gave addi|tional credit and power to the confe|deracy; and enabled it, in 1386, to re|&s;i&s;t all the efforts of a great and im|placable enemy. In that year, Leopold duke of Au&s;tria invaded the canton with a numerous army; when the com|bined troops gained a bloody victory at Sempach, in which Leopold lo&s;t his life. In the accounts of this battle, an in&s;tance of private valour in an individual is recorded, which would have done honour to a Grecian or a Roman name, and only wants the pen of a Thucydides or a Livy to be equalled in fame to the exploits of the mo&s;t admired heroes of antiquity. The Au&s;trian army, far &s;u|perior in number, was drawn up in firm battalion, accoutred in heavy ar|mour, and furni&s;hed with long pikes, which they pre&s;ented before them. The Swi&s;s troops were led on to the attack
<PB N="115" REF="123">
in the form of a wedge, in order to open their way into the ranks of the enemy, and to break the &s;olidity of the battalion. The latter, neverthele&s;s, con|tinuing for &s;ome time impenetrable; Arnold de Winkelried, a native of Un|derwalden, ru&s;hed alone upon the ene|my to certain death; and, &s;eizing as many pikes as he could gra&s;p, endea|voured to force through the ranks: but he was killed in the attempt. His pa|triotic valour, however, was not exerted in vain: it inflamed the Swi&s;s with new courage, and taught them the be&s;t method of penetrating into the battalion; which they at length effected, after the mo&s;t de&s;perate efforts of invincible re&s;olu|tion.</P>
<P>Leopold him&s;elf might have e&s;caped, when his troops fir&s;t began to give way; but, with a magnanimity worthy of a better fate, he determined, after having been a witne&s;s to the total rout of his army, not to &s;urvive &s;o ignominious
<PB N="116" REF="124">
a day: accordingly he ru&s;hed into the thicke&s;t of the enemy, and was &s;lain. In the ar&s;enal of this place are &s;till pre&s;erved his armour, together with a large quantity of cords; which, ac|cording to the tradition of the coun|try, he is &s;aid to have brought with him, in order to bind the citizens of Lucerne. The keeper of the ar&s;enal di&s;played them to us with the &s;ame kind of triumph, as the man, who &s;hews the Tower of London, points out the chains that were taken on board the Spani&s;h armada; which, he tells you, Philip II. de&s;tined for the principal nobility of England.</P>
<P>The government of Lucerne is en|tirely ari&s;tocratical, or rather indeed oli|garchical. There are five hundred citi|zens in the town, from whom a council of one hundred, compri&s;ing the &s;enate or council of &s;tate, are cho&s;en. The for|mer is the nominal &s;overeign; but the whole power actually re&s;ides in the lat|ter,

the &s;upreme council is a&s;&s;embled only upon particular occa&s;ions, for the purpo&s;es of legi&s;lation, and the like. The &s;enate has cognizance of criminal cau&s;es; but in ca&s;e of capital condem|nation, the &s;overeign council is con|voked in order to pronourice the &s;en|tence: a practice worthy of imitation! for the condemnation of a criminal can|not be too maturely weighed; and the more &s;olemnity is u&s;ed in pronouncing the &s;entence, the greater effect it mu&s;t have upon the minds of the people. In civil cau&s;es an appeal lies from the &s;e|nate to the &s;overeign council: but this mu&s;t be a mere formality; as in effect it is an appeal from the &s;enators in one court to the &s;ame &s;enators in ano|ther. Indeed, their influence over the &s;overeign council mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be ab&s;olute: for, they them&s;elves con&s;ti|tute above a third of that body; chu&s;e their own members; are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the principal charges of government,

<P>The chiefs of the republic are two Avoyers, who are cho&s;en from the &s;enate by the council of one hundred, and are confirmed annually.

<P>As Lucerne is fir&s;t in rank and power among the Catholic cantons; all affairs relative to religion are treated of in the diet which a&s;&s;embles in this town every year, compo&s;ed of the deputies of tho&s;e cantons: and the pope's nuncio re&s;ides here. The town contains &s;carcely three thou&s;and inhabitants; has no manu|factures of any con&s;equence, and little commerce: and as to learning, it no where meets with le&s;s encouragement, and con&s;equently is le&s;s cultivated. What a contra&s;t to Zuric! The population of the canton has con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed within this century: a &s;ure proof of a mild and equitable government. The inhabitants are, as I am informed, al|mo&s;t totally engaged in agriculture. The &s;outhern parts of the canton are
<PB N="121" REF="131">
chiefly mountainous, and furni&s;h for exportation cattle, hides, chee&s;e, and butter: all the northern part is fruitful in corn; the crops of which being more than &s;ufficient for the con&s;umption of the whole canton, there is a con&s;tant ex|portation of this article from the weekly market held in the town; to which the inhabitants of the neighbouring demo|cratical cantons re&s;ort, in order to pur|cha&s;e that and other nece&s;&s;aries in which their own country is deficient. The overplus that is wanted to &s;upply this market, is drawn from Suabia and Al&s;ace. This commerce, which (to|gether with the pa&s;&s;age of the mer|chandi&s;e for Italy) is the chief &s;upport of the town, might be exceedingly im|proved and augmented, con&s;idering its advantageous &s;ituation: for, the Reu&s;s i&s;&s;ues from the lake, pa&s;&s;es through the town, and, having joined the Aar, falls into the Rhine.</P>
<P>The whole of what is remarkable in
<PB N="122" REF="132">
the town, may be compri&s;ed in a very &s;hort de&s;cription. The cathedral and the Je&s;uits' church, are the only public build|ings worth ob&s;erving; but they are too much loaded with rich ornaments, and di&s;graced by bad paintings. In the ca|thedral is an organ of a fine tone, and of an extraordinary &s;ize: of the latter you may judge by the dimen&s;ions of the center pipe; which, as the prie&s;t a&s;&s;ured me, is forty feet in length, and near three in breadth, and weighs eleven hundred pounds. The bridges which &s;kirt the town, round the edge of the lake, are the fa&s;hionable walks of the place, and are remarkable for their length. They are covered at top, and open at the &s;ides; by which means one has a con&s;tant view of this delightful and romantic country. They are deco|rated with wretched paintings, con&s;i&s;t|ing of the hi&s;tories of the Old Te&s;ta|ment, the battles of the Swi&s;s, and the dance of Death.</P>

Upon our arrival here ye&s;terday, we &s;ent a letter of recommendation to ge|neral Pfiffer, who received us imme|diately, with his u&s;ual civility. We had heard &s;o much of a topographical repre&s;entation he has formed of part of Swi&s;&s;erland, that we were anxious to get a &s;ight of it; as indeed it well de|&s;erves particular notice, and merits the mo&s;t accurate attention of the curious traveller. The ingenious arti&s;t is a na|tive of Lucerne, and general in the French &s;ervice, and has devoted his lei&s;ure time to the compleating of this work. It is a model in relief; and what is at pre&s;ent fini&s;hed contains about &s;ixty &s;quare leagues of the mo&s;t mountainous parts of Swi&s;&s;erland; name|ly, part of the cantons of Lucerne, Zug, and Berne, together with the whole of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden: and the general has taken elevations and drawings for above as much more. The model of what is completed is twelve
<PB N="124" REF="134">
feet long, and nine and a half broad. The principal part is compo&s;ed of wax, the mountains of &s;tone, and the whole is coloured: but what de&s;erves more particular ob&s;ervation is, that not only the woods of beech, of pine, &amp;c. are differently marked; but al&s;o the out|ward &s;trata of the &s;everal mountains, as well as their form, are di&s;tingui&s;hed. General Pfiffer has already been em|ployed in this work about ten years, with the utmo&s;t patience and a&s;&s;iduity: he has him&s;elf rai&s;ed the plans upon the &s;pots, taken the elevations of the mountains, and laid them down in their &s;everal proportions. The plan is &s;o minutely exact, that it takes in not only all the mountains, lakes, rivers, towns, villages, and fore&s;ts; but every cottage, every torrent, every bridge, and even every cro&s;s is di&s;tinctly and accu|rately repre&s;ented. In the pro&s;ecution of this laborious performance, he has been twice arre&s;ted for a &s;py; and in
<PB N="125" REF="135">
the popular cantons has frequently been forced to work by moon-light, in or|der to avoid the jealou&s;y of the pea|&s;ants, who think their liberty would be endangered, &s;hould &s;o exact a plan be taken of their country. As he is obliged to remain &s;ome time upon the tops of the Alps, where no provi&s;ion can be procured; he generally carries with him a few &s;he-goats, who&s;e milk &s;upplies him with nouri&s;hment. In|deed his per&s;everance in &s;urmounting all the difficulties, that nece&s;&s;arily have ari&s;en in the cour&s;e of this undertaking, is almo&s;t inconceivable. When he has fini&s;hed any particular part, he &s;ends for the pea&s;ants who re&s;ide near the &s;pot, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who hunt the cha|mois, and bids them examine accurately each particular mountain; whether it corre&s;ponds, as far as the &s;mallne&s;s of the &s;cale will admit, with its natural appearance: and then, by frequently re-touching, he corrects the deficiencies.
<PB N="126" REF="136">
He takes all his elevations from the level of the lake of Lucerne; which, according to Mr. De Sau&s;&s;ure, is about fourteen hundred and eight feet above the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>This model, exhibiting the mo&s;t moun|tainous parts of Swi&s;&s;erland, conveys a &s;ublime picture of an immen&s;e body of alps piled one upon another: as if the &s;tory of the Titans were realized, and they had &s;ucceeded (at lea&s;t in one part of the globe) in heaping an O&s;&s;a upon a Pelion, and an Olympus upon an O&s;&s;a. The general informed me (and it is &s;omewhat remarkable) that the tops of the alps which cro&s;s Swi&s;|&s;erland in the &s;ame line, are nearly of the &s;ame level; or in other words, there are continued chains of mountains of the &s;ame elevation, ri&s;ing in progre&s;|&s;ion to the highe&s;t range; and from thence gradually de&s;cending in the &s;ame proportion towards Italy.</P>

He is exceedingly polite and affable to &s;trangers, and ever ready to be of any &s;ervice to travellers, in pointing out to them the be&s;t roads, and in ac|quainting them with the places mo&s;t worthy of ob&s;ervation. From what I &s;aw of him, he &s;eemed to be a man of a more lively imagination, than one &s;hould have expected, con&s;idering the indefatigable patience and laborious pre|ci&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary for the execution of a work of this nature.</P>
<P>Near Lucerne is Mount Pilate, for|merly called Mons <HI>Pileatus,</HI> from the Latin word <HI>pilea;</HI> its top being generally covered with a cloud or cap. This word has been corrupted into <HI>Pilatus;</HI> and from this alteration a thou&s;and ridiculous &s;tories have been invented; among others, that Pontius Pilate, af|ter having condemned our Saviour to death, was &s;eized with remor&s;e, made a little excur&s;ion into Swi&s;&s;erland, and drowned him&s;elf in a lake, which

<P>THE Wald&s;taer See, or the lake of the four cantons, is by far the mo&s;t beautiful and diver&s;ified body of water of this kind I have yet &s;een. The upper branch, or the lake of Lu|cerne, is in the form of a cro&s;s; the &s;ides of which &s;tretch from Ku&s;&s;nacht to Dallenwal, a &s;mall village near Stancz,
<PB N="129" REF="139">
the capital of the canton of Under|walden. It is bounded towards the town of Lucerne (which forms a fine object upon its north-we&s;tern extremity) by cultivated hills &s;loping gradually to the water, contra&s;ted on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide by an enormous ma&s;s of barren and craggy rocks. Mount Pilate ri&s;es bold|ly from the lake, and is perhaps one of the highe&s;t mountains in Swi&s;&s;erland, if e&s;timated from its ba&s;e, and not from the level of the &s;ea. According to ge|neral Pfiffer, its elevation above the lake is more than &s;ix thou&s;and feet: never|thele&s;s its heighth above the Mediterra|nean, is nothing in compari&s;on with that of the alps we are going to vi&s;it; nor indeed does the &s;now continue all the year upon its &s;ummit. It is a &s;ingle in&s;ulated mountain; and is divided at its top into two rugged points, which, when not covered with clouds, form a mo&s;t maje&s;tic appearance.</P>
<P>Towards the end of this branch, the
<PB N="130" REF="140">
mountains that border the lake, ap|proach, and form an exceeding narrow creek &s;carcely a mile acro&s;s; &s;oon after, the lake widens again, and we entered the &s;econd branch, or the lake of Schweitz: on the we&s;tern &s;ide the canton of Un|derwalden, on the ea&s;tern that of Schweitz. Here the mountains are more lofty, and infinitely varied: &s;ome covered to their very &s;ummits with the mo&s;t lively verdure; others perpendicu|lar and craggy; here forming va&s;t am|phitheatres of wood; there jutting into the water in bold promontories.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;tern &s;ide of this branch, is the &s;mall village or town of Ger&s;aw, &s;ituated at the foot of the Rugi: it is the &s;malle&s;t republic in Europe. Its territory is about a league in breadth, and two in length; con&s;i&s;ting partly of a &s;mall neck of land at the edge of the lake, and the remainder lying upon the rapid declivity of the Rugi. In the vil|lage and &s;cattered cottages there may
<PB N="131" REF="141">
perhaps be about a thou&s;and inhabitants: they have their general a&s;&s;embly of bur|ge&s;&s;es, their Landamman, their council of regency, their courts of ju&s;tice, and their militia. I was told, (though I will not ab&s;olutely an&s;wer for the truth of it) that there is not a &s;ingle hor&s;e in the whole territory of the republic; as indeed one might well &s;uppo&s;e: for, the only way of getting to the town is by water, except|ing a narrow path down the &s;teep &s;ides of the mountain, which is almo&s;t im|pa&s;&s;able. This little republic, is under the protection of the four cantons, Lu|cerne, Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden; and in ca&s;e of war furni&s;hes its quota of men. To the ambitious politician, who judges of governments by extent of dominion and power; &s;uch a diminutive republic thrown into an ob&s;cure corner, and &s;carcely known out of its own con|tracted territory, mu&s;t appear unworthy of notice; but the &s;malle&s;t &s;pot of earth
<PB N="132" REF="142">
on which civil freedom is cultivated and flouri&s;hes, cannot fail of being inter|e&s;ting to tho&s;e who know the true value of liberty and independence; and are convinced, that political happine&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t in great riches and exten&s;ive empire.</P>
<P>Towards the end of this branch the lake forms a con&s;iderable bay; in the mid&s;t of which lies the village of Brun|nen, celebrated for the &s;igning of the treaty, in 1315, between Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden. From this point we had a glimp&s;e of Schweitz, the capital burgh of the canton, about two miles from Brunnen: it &s;tands far|ther within the land, at the bottom of two very high, &s;harp, and rugged rocks.</P>
<P>Here we turned &s;hort to our right|hand and entered the third branch, or the lake of Uri; the &s;cenery of which is &s;o amazingly grand and &s;ublime, that the impre&s;&s;ion it made upon me will never
<PB N="133" REF="143">
be era&s;ed from my mind. Imagine to your|&s;elf a deep and narrow lake about nine miles in length, bordered on both &s;ides with rocks uncommonly wild and ro|mantic, and, for the mo&s;t part, per|pendicular; with fore&s;ts of beech and pine growing down their &s;ides to the very edge of the water: indeed the rocks are &s;o entirely &s;teep and overhanging, that it was with difficulty we could ob|&s;erve more than four or five &s;pots, where we could have landed. On the right|hand, upon our fir&s;t entrance, a detach|ed piece of rock, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hore, engaged our attention. It ri&s;es to about &s;ixty feet in heighth; is covered with bru&s;hwood and &s;hrubs; and reminded me in &s;ome degree of tho&s;e that &s;hoot up in the middle of the fall of the Rhine near Schaffhau&s;en: but here the lake was as &s;mooth as chry&s;tal; and the &s;ilent, &s;olemn gloom which reigned in this place, was not le&s;s awful and affecting than the tremendous
<PB N="134" REF="144">
roaring of the cataract in the other. Somewhat farther, upon the highe&s;t point of the Seeli&s;berg, we ob&s;erved a &s;mall chapel that &s;eemed inacce&s;&s;ible; and below it, the little village of Gruti, near which the three heroes of the&s;e cantons are &s;aid to have met, and to have taken reciprocal oaths of fidelity, when they planned the famous revolu|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 142.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, but farther on, appears the chapel of William Tell, erected in honour of that hero, and upon the very &s;pot where (it is &s;aid) he leaped from the boat, in which he was carrying pri&s;oner to Ku&s;&s;nacht. It is built upon a rock that juts out into the lake under a hanging wood: a &s;ituation amid &s;cenes &s;o &s;trikingly awful, as can|not fail of &s;trongly affecting even the mo&s;t dull and torpid imagination! On the in&s;ide of this chapel, the &s;everal ac|tions of William Tell are badly painted. While we were viewing them, we ob|&s;erved
<PB N="135" REF="145">
the countenances of our water|men gli&s;tened with exultation, and they related to us with much &s;pirit and &s;en&s;i|bility the cruelties and tyranny of Ge&s;|ler, governor of Uri, and the intrepid behaviour of their glorious deliverer. Indeed I have frequently remarked with plea&s;ure, the national enthu&s;ia&s;m which &s;o generally prevails in this country; and have greatly admired the fire and animation with which the people di&s;|cour&s;e of tho&s;e famous men among their ance&s;tors, to whom they are in|debted for that happy &s;tate of indepen|dence which they now enjoy. This laudable &s;pirit is continually kept up and encouraged by the number of &s;ta|tues, and other memorials, of the an|tient Swi&s;s heroes, which are &s;o com|mon in every town and village through|out Swi&s;&s;erland. Among the&s;e, Tell is the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed, and he &s;eems to be the peculiar favourite of the common people: the rea&s;on is obvious; for, his
<PB N="136" REF="146">
&s;tory partakes greatly of the marvel|lous.</P>
<P>A man of letters at Berne has written a treati&s;e, entitled <HI>Fable Danoi&s;e,</HI> in which he calls in que&s;tion the hi&s;tory of Wil|liam Tell. His arguments in general are by no means conclu&s;ive; he mentions, however, two circum&s;tances, which, if true, are convincing proofs, that much fiction is interwoven with the whole account: for, the author a&s;&s;erts that the incident of Tell's &s;hooting the apple off the head of his &s;on, is not recorded in any of the contemporary hi&s;torians, al|though they give the minute&s;t accounts of the governor's tyranny; and that the fir&s;t writer who takes notice of it, is Petermann Etterlin of Lucerne, who lived in the latter end of the fifteenth century, near two hundred years after the fact is &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened. Be&s;ides, a &s;tory of the &s;ame kind is re|lated in the Dani&s;h annals of Saxo Grammaticus, with no other difference
<PB N="137" REF="147">
than that of names; Herald king of Den|mark &s;upplying the place of the governor of Uri; and Tocco that of William Tell: and this event, which is &s;aid to have hap|pened in 965, is attended al&s;o with near|ly the &s;ame incidents, as tho&s;e recorded in the Swi&s;s accounts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As Saxo Grammaticus is an author but little known, and the pa&s;&s;age in que&s;tion being exceed|ingly curious; the reader will find it in&s;erted in the Appendix.</NOTE>. Neverthele&s;s, it is far from being a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence, that, becau&s;e the authenticity of the &s;tory concerning the apple is liable to &s;ome doubts; <HI>therefore</HI> the whole tradition relating to Tell is fabulous. Neither is it a proof again&s;t the reality of a fact, that it is not mentioned by any contemporary hi&s;torians. The ge|neral hi&s;tory of William Tell is re|peatedly celebrated in &s;everal old Ger|man &s;ongs, &s;o remarkable for their an|tient dialect and &s;implicity, as almo&s;t
<PB N="138" REF="148">
to rai&s;e the deeds they celebrate above all rea&s;onable &s;u&s;picion: add to this, the con&s;tant tradition of the country, to|gether with two chapels erected &s;ome centuries ago, in memory of his ex|ploits.</P>
<P>The three cantons were &s;o much of|fended with the author for throwing any doubt upon the actions of their antient hero, that they pre&s;ented a re|mon&s;trance to the &s;overeign council of Berne: in con&s;equence of which, the pamphlet in que&s;tion was publicly burnt at Uri. In this in&s;tance their national prejudices (if they really de&s;erve that name) become, in &s;ome &s;ort, me|ritorious and re&s;pectable.</P>
<P>The cro&s;s bow is &s;till much u&s;ed in the&s;e parts, as I had an opportunity of ob&s;erving upon our landing at Fluellen, where I &s;aw &s;everal very young boys, each with a cro&s;s bow in his hand. There happened to be a butt at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the place; and I gave them
<PB N="139" REF="149">
to under&s;tand, that tho&s;e who hit the mark &s;hould receive a penny for their dexterity. Upon this intimation, three boys took aim &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, two of whom hit the very centre of the butt, and ob|tained the prize accordingly: but, the third mi&s;&s;ing, I made him &s;hoot till he touched the mark; which, after two or three trials, he at length performed.</P>
<P>From Fluellen we walked to Altdorf, the capital burgh of the canton of Uri, &s;ituated in a narrow vale almo&s;t intirely &s;urrounded by &s;tupendous mountains. It contains &s;everal neat hou&s;es; the tops whereof are covered with large de|tached &s;tones, placed there in order to prevent the roofs being carried away by tho&s;e violent &s;torms, that frequently ru&s;h down from the neighbouring moun|tains into this valley.</P>
<P>When the greate&s;t part of Helvetia was &s;ubject to the empire; the inhabi|tants of Uri, Schweitz, and Under|walden, had long enjoyed the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable
<PB N="140" REF="150">
privileges, particularly the right of being governed by their own magi&s;|trates: the clergy and many of the nobles, indeed, had fiefs and &s;ubjects in tho&s;e re&s;pective territories; but the bulk of the people formed &s;everal commu|nities almo&s;t totally independent. Dur|ing the twelfth century, various di&s;putes which the&s;e three cantons had with the emperors, united them more firmly than ever; and they were accu&s;tomed every ten years to renew formally their al|liance with each other. Such was their &s;ituation at the death of Frederic II. in 1250. From this period, or &s;oon afterwards, commences the interregnum in the empire: during which time of anarchy and confu&s;ion, the nobles and bi&s;hops endeavouring to extend their power, and to encroach upon the pri|vileges of the people; Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden, put them&s;elves under the protection of Rhodolph of Hab&s;|bourg, who, in 1270, being cho&s;en
<PB N="141" REF="151">
emperor, terminated the interregnum. Rhodolph had a revenue a&s;&s;igned to him by the&s;e cantons; and he appointed a governor, who had cognizance in all criminal cau&s;es: the rights, however, and privileges of the people were ex|pre&s;sly re&s;erved.</P>
<P>Rhodolph, &s;ome time after his ac|ce&s;&s;ion to the throne of the empire, li&s;tened to the ambitious &s;chemes of his &s;on Albert duke of Au&s;tria, who was de&s;irous to form Helvetia into a dutchy. For this purpo&s;e the emperor purcha&s;ed the domains of &s;everal abbeys, and other con&s;iderable fiefs in Swi&s;&s;erland, as well in the canton of Schweitz as in the neighbouring territories. The great in|crea&s;e of power, which the emperor gained by this acqui&s;ition, induced the three cantons to renew their alliance, and to demand a confirmation of their privileges: and their demands were granted. Upon the death of Rhodolph, Adolphus of Na&s;&s;au &s;ucceeded him, from
<PB N="142" REF="152">
whom they obtained the &s;ame confir|mation. But when Albert was after|wards cho&s;en emperor, he refu&s;ed to ratify it: and, in order totally to &s;ub|due the people, he placed over them two governors, who were guilty of many flagitious acts of tyranny and oppre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances Werner de Staffach of Schweitz, Walther Fur&s;t of Uri, and Arnold de Melchtall of Under|walden, planned the famous revolution, which took place January 13, 1308, and re&s;tored liberty to the three cantons. Albert, while he was preparing to attack them, was <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The occa&s;ion of this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and the cir|cum&s;tances attending it, were as follow:&mdash;Albert, as guardian to his nephew. John of Hab&s;bourg, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hereditary dominions in Suabia, and refu&s;ed to deliver them up to him under various pretences. At length, wearied with repeated &s;olicitations to no purpo&s;e, John entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t his uncle with Rhodolph de Warth, Ulric de Palme, Walther d'E&s;chen|bach, and Conrad de Tagerfeld.</P>
<P>The emperor dined at Baden, in his way to Rheinfelds, a town in the circle of Suabia, where was the empre&s;s his wife with a con&s;iderable body of troops, with which he propo&s;ed attacking the three cantons. Contemporary hi&s;torians, who have recorded the minute&s;t circum&s;tances of this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation, relate, that Albert was in very high &s;pirits during the repa&s;t; and that upon his nephew again entreating to be put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heredi|tary dominions, the emperor, with an air of banter, placed a garland of flowers upon his head, adding, at the &s;ame time, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This will be more agreeable to you, for the pre&s;ent, than the cares of a trou|ble&s;ome government."</Q> This taunt had &s;uch an effect upon the young man, that he bur&s;t into tears, flung away the flowers, and could not be prevailed upon to &s;it down to the table.</P>
<P>After dinner Albert continued his journey on hor&s;eback, accompanied by his &s;on Leopold, the con&s;pirators, and the re&s;t of his u&s;ual attendants; and came, near the town of Windi&s;ch, in the canton of Berne, to the Reu&s;s. Over this river, there was no bridge, but pa&s;&s;engers were u&s;ually ferried upon a raft. The con&s;pirators pa&s;&s;ed over fir&s;t; and immediately after them Albert, who rode gently on, waiting for his &s;on Leopold, and the remainder of his &s;uite. As he was riding through a field, not far from the ca&s;tle of Hab&s;|bourg, and oppo&s;ite to the town of Brugg, which lies on the other &s;ide of the Aar, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &s;ud|denly be&s;et him. One of them &s;eizing his hor&s;e's bridle, John of Hab&s;bourg reproached him for his inju&s;tice in detaining his dominions; and, without waiting for an an&s;wer, &s;truck him on the neck with his &s;word: Rhodolph de Warth wounded him in the &s;ide; and Ulric de Palme clove his head with his &s;abre. In this condition they left him expiring upon the ground.</P>
<P>This a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination was committed the 1&s;t of May 1308, in the open day, and in the &s;ight of his &s;on Leopold and the re&s;t of his court, who had not as yet pa&s;&s;ed the river; and, though they were witne&s;&s;es to the murder, it was not in their power to give the emperor any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The field lies between the Aar and the Reu&s;s, not far from the junction of tho&s;e two rivers; and the very &s;pot, where he was ma&s;&s;acred, is marked by a convent, erected by his wife Eli|&s;abeth, and his daughter-in-law Agnes, the widow of his &s;on Rhodolph king of Bohemia: the place was called Konigsfeld, or King's field; a name it retains to this day. The remains of the emperor were buried in the convent of Witterling, from whence they were afterwards tran&s;ported to Spiol, and there interred.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins e&s;caped without being pur&s;ued; and retired into the cantons of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden, expecting to find a &s;ure a&s;ylum in a nation, which Albert was preparing to invade. But tho&s;e generous people, dete&s;ting a crime of &s;o atrocious a nature, although committed upon the per&s;on of their greate&s;t and mo&s;t formidable enemy, refu&s;ed to give the murderers any protection. D'E&s;chenbach concealed him&s;elf in the di&s;gui&s;e of a common labourer during thirty years; nor was his rank di&s;covered till he confe&s;&s;ed it upon his death-bed; De Palme, de&s;titute of common ne|ce&s;&s;aries, died of extreme poverty; and De Warth, tied to a hor&s;e's tail, like a common male|factor, and dragged to the place of execution, was broken upon the wheel. Some hi&s;torians relate, that he was the fir&s;t per&s;on who ever &s;uffered that &s;pecies of torture; that he remained three days in the mo&s;t dreadful agonies; and that his wife (&s;uch was the &s;trange proof &s;he gave of her affection!) attended him to the place of execution, nor could be prevailed upon to withdraw her&s;elf till he ex|pired. John of Hab&s;bourg, commonly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the appellation of <HI>parricide</HI> from this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, did not reap the benefit from his crime that he expected: for, by order of the emperor Henry VII. he retired into a mona&s;tery of Augu&s;tin friars at Pi&s;a, where he died in 1313.</P>
<P>The widow of Albert turned her whole thoughts towards revenging the death of her hu&s;band; and, in this pur&s;uit, involved the innocent no le&s;s than the guilty: for, all who had <HI>any</HI> connection with the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, &s;uffered the &s;ame puni&s;hment, and were &s;acrificed with undi&s;tingui&s;hing cruelty to the manes of the decea&s;ed emperor. Mean while the three cantons were left, for a &s;hort time, to the undi&s;|turbed enjoyment of their liberties, and to &s;trengthen them&s;elves again&s;t any future attack: and thus they innocently reaped the fole advantage which was derived from this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P></NOTE> a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by his nephew John of Hab&s;bourg.

troops lo&s;t but fourteen men in this memorable engagement, which in&s;ured their independence for ever. This &s;ame year the three cantons entered into a perpetual alliance, which was ratified at Brunnen: and this alliance is the grand foundation of the Helvetic con|federacy. Such were the feeble begin|nings of a league, which has &s;ince be|come &s;o formidable by the acce&s;&s;ion of ten more cantons, and by the additional &s;trength of its numerous allies: and it is remarkable, that Swi&s;&s;erland is the only country which, on the <HI>one &s;ide,</HI> has confined the limits of the German empire; and, on the <HI>other,</HI> has &s;et bounds to the French monarchy, which it has never dared to tran&s;gre&s;s.</P>
<P>Schweitzerland, or, as we term it, Swi&s;&s;erland, originally comprehended only the three cantons of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden, but that name was af|terwards extended to all Helvetia. It deri|ved that appellation either from the can|ton
<PB N="148" REF="158">
of Schweitz, as having particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf in the revolution of 1308, and al&s;o at the battle of Morgar|ten; or from the Au&s;trians calling all tho&s;e who inhabited the&s;e mountainous parts, by the general denomination of Schweitzers.</P>
<P>Swi&s;&s;erland was the rock which the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria &s;plit upon, during more than a century. Blinded with re&s;ent|ment again&s;t their former &s;ubjects, and anxious to recover their lo&s;t domains in the&s;e parts; the &s;everal dukes led on in per&s;on con&s;iderable armies to &s;ubdue a nation, who&s;e &s;pirit was unconquera|ble; and to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a country, which, from its &s;ituation, was ea&s;ily defended by an handful of men again&s;t the mo&s;t numerous troops. Within the period above mentioned, Au&s;tria neglected &s;everal opportunities of ag|grandizing her&s;elf in other parts; and, &s;lighting what was more fea&s;ible, bent her whole efforts to obtain what in its
<PB N="149" REF="159">
very nature was unattainable. The con&s;equence of this mi&s;taken policy, was, a continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of defeats, at|tended with a prodigious expence, and the lo&s;s of their brave&s;t troops: until at length, convinced of their error, they totally relinqui&s;hed an attempt, which had co&s;t them &s;o much fruitle&s;s blood and trea&s;ure. But although &s;everal em|perors of that hou&s;e occa&s;ionally made alliances with the Swi&s;s cantons; yet it was not till the treaty of We&s;tphalia that their independence was fully and finally acknowledged by Ferdinand III. and the whole empire.</P>
<P>The government of the&s;e three can|tons is entirely democratical, and near|ly the &s;ame. The &s;upreme power re|&s;ides in the people at large, who are, in each of the&s;e cantons, divided into &s;everal communities, from which are cho&s;en equally the councils of regency. In the general a&s;&s;embly the Landam|man, and the principal magi&s;trates, are
<PB N="150" REF="160">
elected: and every burgher, at the age of fourteen in the canton of Uri; and of fifteen in Schweitz and Underwalden, has a right to vote. The councils of regency of Uri and Schweitz con&s;i&s;t each of &s;ixty members, and re&s;ide at the capital burghs. In this council the executive power is ve&s;ted, and from this body the principal magi&s;trates are cho&s;en. Underwalden is divided into the inferior and &s;uperior valley; and each of the&s;e divi&s;ions has its own pe|culiar government and admini&s;tration. Formerly the whole canton was under the &s;ame admini&s;tration; but the two di&s;tricts &s;eparated upon &s;ome di&s;pute, and have &s;ince formed two di&s;tinct go|vernments; which have each their ge|neral a&s;&s;embly, their Landamman, and their council of regency: but for the ma|nagement of external affairs, there is a joint council formed of the two divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The&s;e three cantons contain about eighty thou&s;and &s;ouls, and in ca&s;e of
<PB N="151" REF="161">
nece&s;&s;ity could furni&s;h above twenty thou|&s;and militia. All the Catholic cantons enjoy con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idies from France. Every burgher, of the age of fourteen, receives &s;ix livres (five &s;hillings of our money) annually; the Landamman and the magi&s;trates more in proportion. The canton of Schweitz has had for &s;ome time a quarrel with France; and accordingly withdrew its troops from that &s;ervice: but this year the matter has been accommodated; and the king pays every male child of a burgher, four livres annually, reckoning from the time of his birth. I cannot help thinking, that the acceptance of the&s;e &s;ub&s;idies derogates in &s;ome mea&s;ure from that &s;pirit of ab&s;olute indepen|dence, which the cantons of Swi&s;&s;er|land profe&s;s; and that it would be far more honourable to enter into an al|liance with France upon terms of the mo&s;t perfect equality, than to receive from that kingdom paltry &s;ub&s;idies,
<PB N="152" REF="162">
which give an air of venality to their &s;everal treaties.</P>
<P>The &s;ame kind of &s;oil, and the &s;ame &s;ort of productions, are common to the three cantons: the whole country being rugged and mountainous, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of excellent pa&s;ture, but rai&s;es little corn, and has no vines. One cannot but ob&s;erve with a&s;toni&s;hment to what a degree of fertility they have improved a land, naturally the mo&s;t barren, and for which they fought with as much zeal and intrepidity, as if they had been contending for the riche&s;t plains of Sicily or A&s;ia Minor. In the&s;e little democratical &s;tates &s;umptuary laws are not nece&s;&s;ary; for, they &s;carcely know, even in idea, what luxury is. Such indeed is the purity, or (as &s;ome perhaps would call it) the au&s;terity of morals, which &s;till prevails among the&s;e people, as cannot ea&s;ily be imagined by the inhabitants of great and opulent cities: and I cannot reflect on that af|fectionate
<PB N="153" REF="163">
patrioti&s;m which &s;o &s;trongly attaches them to their country, with|out calling to mind that beautiful de|&s;cription of the Swi&s;s pea&s;ant, in Gold|&s;mith's Traveller:<Q><L>" Dear is that &s;hed to which his &s;oul conforms,</L>
<L>" And dear that hill which lifts him to the &s;torms:</L>
<L>" And as a child, when &s;caring &s;ounds mole&s;t,</L>
<L>" Clings clo&s;e and clo&s;er to the mother's brea&s;t;</L>
<L>" So the loud torrent, and the whirlwind's roar,</L>
<L>" But bind him to his native mountains more."</L></Q></P>
<P>Every &s;tep we now advance is tread|ing, as it were, upon &s;acred ground; as monuments continually occur of tho&s;e memorable battles, by which the Swi&s;s re&s;cued them&s;elves from oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ecured the enjoyment of their invalu|able freedom. I am now indeed in the very center of civil liberty; would I could add of religious too! but the church of Rome, exclu&s;ively, is e&s;tab|li&s;hed here; and the people are in ge|neral bigotted, &s;uper&s;titious, and into|lerant. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, how|ever,
<PB N="154" REF="164">
that this intolerant &s;pirit is not wholly confined to the Catholic can|tons; for, in tho&s;e where the Prote&s;tants prevail, Calvini&s;m is alone admitted: and thus a nation, who prides her|&s;elf upon her freedom, denies the free exerci&s;e of religion to every other &s;ect except that which predominates. Is not this &s;triking at the fir&s;t principle, and mo&s;t valuable privilege, of genuine li|berty?</P>
<P>Long as my letter already is, I can|not forbear mentioning, before I con|clude it, a peculiar cu&s;tom ob&s;erved in &s;ome of the&s;e democratical &s;tates: every per&s;on who is cho&s;en for a bailliage, or any office in the lea&s;t lucrative, is obliged to pay a certain &s;tipulated &s;um into the public fund. This practice is attended with one ill con&s;equence at lea&s;t; as the &s;ucce&s;sful candidate is in &s;ome mea|&s;ure authori&s;ed to &s;tretch his preroga|tives, in order to make the mo&s;t of the profits of his charge. Accordingly
<PB N="155" REF="165">
it is a general remark, that in the com|mon bailliages the bailiffs appointed by the popular cantons are more apt to be guilty of exactions than tho&s;e of the ari&s;tocratical.</P>

<P>SWISSERLAND is a mo&s;t delight|ful country, and merits the parti|cular ob&s;ervation of the traveller, as well for the diver&s;ity of the &s;everal go|vernments, as for the wonderful beau|ties of nature: but the impo&s;itions of the innkeepers, the difficulty of procur|ing hor&s;es, and the exorbitant price one is obliged to pay for the hire of them, are the taxes one mu&s;t inevitably be &s;ubject to, for the enjoyment of the&s;e its <HI>delights.</HI> The&s;e little inconvenien|ces
<PB N="156" REF="166">
however &s;hould be borne with pa|tience and good-humour; and I will not trouble you with any &s;pienetic com|plaints of tho&s;e unplea&s;ant circum&s;tances which all travellers mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily meet with.</P>
<P>We quitted Altdorf after dinner, hav|ing with difficulty hired two hor&s;es, be|&s;ides one for the baggage; we procured, however, another upon the road: &s;o that what with riding and tying we got on very well. About nine miles from Altdorf, we began a&s;cending. The road winds continually along the &s;teep &s;ides of the mountains; and the Reu&s;s in many places entirely fills up the bottom of the valley, which is very narrow: that river &s;ometimes appeared &s;everal hundred yards below us; <HI>here</HI> ru&s;hing a con&s;iderable way through a fore&s;t of pines; <HI>there</HI> falling down in ca&s;cades, and lo&s;ing it&s;elf in the valley. We pa&s;&s;ed it &s;everal times over bridges of a &s;ingle arch, and beheld it tumbling under our
<PB N="157" REF="167">
feet in channels which it had forced through the &s;olid rock; innumerable torrents roaring down the &s;ides of the mountains; which were &s;ometimes bare, &s;ometimes finely wooded, with here and there &s;ome fanta&s;tic beeches hanging on the &s;ides of the precipice, and half ob|&s;curing the river from our view. The darkne&s;s and &s;olitude of the fore&s;ts; the occa&s;ional liveline&s;s and variety of the verdure; immen&s;e fragments of rock blended with enormous ma&s;&s;es of ice, that had tumbled from the mountains above; rocks of an a&s;toni&s;hing heighth piled up|on one another, and &s;hutting in the vale;&mdash;&s;uch are the &s;ublime and mag|nificent &s;cenes with which this romantic country abounds, and which enchanted us beyond expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We &s;et out this morning early from Wa&s;en, a &s;mall village where we pa&s;&s;ed the night; and continued advancing for &s;ome way on a rugged a&s;cent, through the &s;ame wild and beautiful tract of
<PB N="158" REF="168">
country, which I have ju&s;t mentioned. We could &s;carce walk an hundred yards without cro&s;&s;ing &s;ome of tho&s;e torrents, that precipitated with violence from the tops of the mountains in different forms; the water clearer than chry&s;tal. The road, exceedingly &s;teep and craggy, is chiefly paved: in many places it is car|ried upon arches under a high moun|tain, and overhangs a deep precipice; the river roaring and foaming below. This being one of the great pa&s;&s;ages into Italy, we met a con&s;iderable number of pack-hor&s;es laden with merchandi&s;e: and as the road in particular parts is very narrow, it required &s;ome dexterity in the hor&s;es to pa&s;s one another without jo&s;t|ling. The&s;e roads, hanging as they do over the precipice, cannot fail of in|&s;piring terror to tho&s;e travellers, who are unaccu&s;tomed to them; and more par|ticularly as the mules and hor&s;es have a &s;ingular method of going on. They do not keep in the middle of the track,
<PB N="159" REF="169">
but continue cro&s;&s;ing from the &s;ide of the mountain towards the edge of the precipice, then turn a&s;lant abruptly; and thus form, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my|&s;elf, a con&s;tant zig-zag.</P>
<P>Thus far the valley of St. Gothard appeared to be well peopled; and we pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal villages &s;ituated towards the bottom and le&s;s narrow part of the valley: the &s;ides of the mountains were occa&s;ionally &s;trewed thick with cottages; covered with fo|re&s;ts; or enriched with pa&s;tures. Still continuing to a&s;cend, the country a lit|tle beyond Wa&s;en &s;uddenly changed. It now became more wild and perfectly de&s;ert: there were no traces of any trees, except here and there a &s;tubbed pine; the rocks were more bare, craggy, and impending; not the lea&s;t &s;ign of any habitation; and &s;carce a blade of gra&s;s to be &s;een. We then came to a bridge thrown acro&s;s a very deep cha&s;m over the Reu&s;s, which here forms a
<PB N="160" REF="170">
con&s;iderable cataract down the &s;hagged &s;ides of the mountain, and over im|men&s;e fragments of rock which it has undermined in its cour&s;e. This bridge is called <HI>Teufels-bruck,</HI> or the devil's bridge; the common people always at|tributing works of any difficulty to the devil. As we &s;tood upon the bridge admiring the cataract, we were covered with a kind of drizzling rain; the river throwing up the &s;pray to a con&s;iderable heighth. The&s;e are &s;ublime &s;cenes of horror, of which tho&s;e who have not been &s;pectators, can form no idea: nei|ther the powers of painting nor poe|try can give an adequate image of them.</P>
<P>Not far from this wonderful land|&s;cape (the country &s;till continuing &s;oli|tary and de&s;olate) the road led us into a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, of about eighty paces in length, cut through a rock of granite, which opened at the oppo|&s;ite entrance into the &s;erene and culti|vated
<PB N="161" REF="171">
valley of Ur&s;eren: the objects that pre&s;ented them&s;elves to us were, a village backed by an high mountain, on the &s;ides of which was a wood of pines; pea&s;ants at work in the fields; cattle feeding in the meadows; and the river, which, when we la&s;t &s;aw it, loudly da&s;hed over rude fragments of rock in a continual cataract, now flowed &s;ilently and &s;moothly along; while the &s;un, which had been hidden from us when we were in the deep valley, here &s;hone forth in its full &s;plendor. In general we had hi|therto always found a gradual advance from extreme wildne&s;s to high cultiva|tion; but in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the change was &s;o abrupt and in&s;tantaneous, that it &s;eemed like a &s;udden enchant|ment.</P>
<P>In this valley are four villages, Ur&s;e|ren, Hopital, Realp, and Zundorf; forming a &s;mall republic under the pro|tection of the canton of Uri. The ter|ritory of this little commonwealth is
<PB N="162" REF="172">
about nine miles in length and two in breadth, and contains thirteen hundred &s;ouls. The people elect in their gene|ral a&s;&s;embly, their Talamman or chief, as al&s;o &s;ome other magi&s;trates: and there is a permanent council of fifteen mem|bers, who meet alternately in the differ|ent di&s;tricts. The inhabitants of this valley enjoy very great privileges; but the republic is not ab&s;olutely indepen|dent: for in civil cau&s;es an appeal lies from their courts of ju&s;tice to Altdorf; and in criminal ones, although the trial is in the courts of the valley, and before the judges of the country; yet two deputies from the government of Uri are pre&s;ent at the deci&s;ion, and deliver in to the judges the opinion of the council of Altdorf.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the con&s;iderable ele|vation of this valley, and the coldne&s;s of the air even at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, it produces excellent pa&s;ture and &s;ome barley. The only wood they
<PB N="163" REF="173">
have is the &s;mall plantation of pines I ju&s;t now mentioned, ri&s;ing behind the village of Ur&s;eren, and which is pre&s;erved with uncommon care and re|verence: in &s;ome parts indeed, along the banks of the Reu&s;s, there is here and there a &s;mall quantity of bru&s;h-wood and &s;tubbed willows; but the&s;e do not &s;upply the inhabitants with a thou|&s;andth part of the fuel nece&s;&s;ary for con&s;umption in this climate. In the ad|jacent country there are &s;everal mines of chry&s;tal; of which a con&s;iderable quan|tity is exported to Milan, as well from hence as from Altdorf. The language of the country &s;till continues a kind of Swi&s;s-German, but almo&s;t every per&s;on &s;peaks Italian.</P>
<P>The valley of Ur&s;eren is a &s;mall plain entirely &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by high and barren rocks, the tops whereof are covered with &s;now. This plain is com|monly &s;aid to form the ba&s;e of the mountain of St. Gothard; though the
<PB N="164" REF="174">
latter is more properly an enormous mountain, piled upon the &s;houlders of other mountains which ri&s;e rapidly from the lake of Lucerne. Near the mid|dle of this beautiful plain we turned to the left, and again entered a valley filled with the ruins of broken moun|tains; the Reu&s;s bur&s;ting through it with a mo&s;t rapid and vehement tor|rent; on each &s;ide, immen&s;e &s;hattered blocks of granite, of a beautiful greyi&s;h colour (and of which the &s;ummits of the&s;e alps are compo&s;ed) confu&s;edly piled together. It is about three leagues from Ur&s;eren to this place; and the a&s;cent all the way as &s;teep as a hor&s;e can well mount: but the road, con&s;ider|ing the ruggedne&s;s of the rocks, is not &s;o incommodious as one might expect.</P>
<P>We are now lodged at a hou&s;e in|habited by two Italian friars from the convent of Capuchins at Milan; who receive all &s;trangers that pa&s;s through the&s;e inho&s;pitable regions; where there
<PB N="165" REF="175">
is no other hou&s;e for a con&s;iderable way. One of the friars is ab&s;ent, &s;o that I am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his bedchamber: it is a &s;nug little room, where a man may &s;leep very well without being an an|chorite; and which, after the fatigues of our journey, I enjoy with a &s;atisfac|tion much too &s;en&s;ible to envy the lux|ury of a palace. Our ho&s;t has ju&s;t given us a dinner, con&s;i&s;ting of delicious trout, (with which &s;ome of the lakes and the neighbouring torrents abound) eggs and milk, together with a de&s;ert compo&s;ed of excellent butter and chee&s;e; both which were made in this dreary &s;pot; the pa&s;|ture being peculiarly exqui&s;ite.</P>
<P>Upon our arrival we were rejoiced to find a good fire; the weather being &s;o exceedingly cold, that I, who was only clad in a thin camlet coat, came into the convent half frozen. It is &s;ingular to find, at the di&s;tance of only a day's journey, the climate &s;o different from what it was at Altdorf: the air is ab|&s;olutely
<PB N="166" REF="176">
in a freezing &s;tate; and I ju&s;t now pa&s;&s;ed by a boy at work, who was blowing his fingers to warm them. If the cold be &s;uch in the mid&s;t of &s;um|mer, how intolerably piercing mu&s;t it prove in December? The &s;now begins to fall here the latter end of September; and the lakes about this &s;pot are frozen during nine months in the year.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t returned from vi&s;iting the &s;ources of the Te&s;in and the Reu&s;s; which ri&s;e within two miles of each other. The former, in the &s;tate I &s;aw it, flowed from under a ma&s;s of ice; but the friar who accompanied us, told me, that, when the ice is melted, it is &s;een bur&s;ting from the rock: from thence it takes its cour&s;e towards the &s;outh; is joined in its pa&s;&s;age by &s;everal torrents; traver&s;es the lake of Locarno, and part of the Milane&s;e, and at length unites with the Po. The latter river i&s;&s;ues from the lake Loacendro, which is about two miles in circumference; flows towards
<PB N="167" REF="177">
the north into the lake of Lucerne, and from thence throws it&s;elf into the Aar and the Rhine. It was from the dif|ferent cour&s;es of the&s;e two rivers, that Mr. de Boufflers &s;aid, that upon the top of the St. Gothard, a man might &s;pit into the Ocean and the Mediterra|nean. The&s;e lakes (of which kind there are a con&s;iderable number in the&s;e parts) are equally deep in winter and &s;ummer, and always pre&s;erve the &s;ame level. They are probably formed by the melting of the &s;nows, with which the circumjacent mountains are covered; although in &s;e|veral there is no appearance of their being &s;upplied by any torrent. For, the &s;nows thus melted, force them&s;elves channels in the rocks; and, flowing through &s;ubterra|neous pa&s;&s;ages, i&s;&s;ue out at &s;ome di&s;tance: and by this means the true &s;ources of the&s;e great bodies of water lie conceal|ed. Within a day's journey is the &s;ource of the Rhine in the Gri&s;ons; and about the di&s;tance of three leagues, that of the
<PB N="168" REF="178">
Rhone in the Furca: which mountain we &s;hall pa&s;s to-morrow. We are &s;till &s;urrounded by very high, rugged rocks, and inacce&s;&s;ible glaciers; &s;o that our view is much confined: and though I walked above a league towards Italy, in hopes of having an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of part of that delightful country, yet I could &s;ee nothing but rocks, precipices, and torrents.</P>
<P>I am at this in&s;tant near <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to Mr. de Sau&s;&s;ure, the &s;pot upon which the hou&s;e of the Capuchin friars is built, is 1,061 French toi&s;es above the &s;ea.</NOTE> &s;even thou&s;and feet perpendicular above the level of the &s;ea: no incon&s;iderable heighth, mo&s;t certainly.

above the re&s;t of mankind than I really am. Mikeli, who mea&s;ured the principal mountains of Swi&s;&s;erland (but who is very inaccurate in his calculations) con&s;i|ders this as the highe&s;t of all; and he e&s;timates its elevation above the &s;ea as equal to 17,600 feet. But the truth is, St. Gothard, &s;o far from being of that elevation, is by no means the highe&s;t mountain of Swi&s;&s;erland; and there is probably not one mountain, either in Europe, A&s;ia, or Africa, of that heighth. According to general Pfiffer, the mo&s;t elevated part of the St. Gothard ri&s;es above the &s;ea 9,075 feet: an heighth con&s;iderably le&s;s than that of Aetna and of Teneriff; and &s;till more inferior to that of &s;everal in this great chain of alps, which &s;eparate Italy from Swi&s;&s;erland.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Mun&s;ter in the Vallais, <DATE>Augu&s;t 11.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Arrived here late ye&s;terday evening; and &s;o fatigued that I could not have written a line for any con&s;ideration what&s;oever: but I am this morning quite refre&s;hed with a comfortable &s;leep, and in &s;pirits to continue my journal. I took leave of our ho&s;t of St. Gothard, after having wi&s;hed him a plea|&s;ant winter in that dreary &s;ituation; and walked on alone, for about two leagues, down the vale of St. Gothard. Indeed I frequently quit my company, and either go on before, or &s;tay behind, that I may enjoy uninterrupted, and with a &s;ort of melancholy plea&s;ure, the&s;e &s;ublime exhibitions of Nature in her mo&s;t awful and tremendous forms. I entered the valley of Ur&s;eren at Hopi|tal; and was again &s;truck with the &s;trong contra&s;t between that cultivated
<PB N="171" REF="181">
vale and the de&s;olate country I had ju&s;t quitted. We pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;mall village of Zundorf; and &s;topt at that of Realp, to get &s;ome refre&s;hment, and bait our hor&s;es. From thence we &s;oon arrived at the extremity of the valley of Ur&s;eren; where we began a&s;cending a path &s;o narrow, &s;teep, and rugged, that I could not forbear &s;u&s;pecting we had mi&s;&s;ed our way, as it &s;eemed almo&s;t impracticable for hor&s;es: upon their arrival however I mounted, being a lit|tle fatigued with my walk from St. Gothard to Realp. It was a &s;ingle path, up a &s;teep mountain, where an hor&s;e, with &s;ome dexterity, could ju&s;t put one leg before the other: and this path &s;ometimes lay upon the edge of a precipice, very craggy and &s;tony; where, if my &s;teed had happened to &s;tumble, we mu&s;t both inevitably have peri&s;hed. But as I knew he had no more fancy than my&s;elf to take a roll down the precipice, I had nothing to do but to
<PB N="172" REF="182">
tru&s;t entirely to his di&s;cretion, fling the bridle upon his mane, and let him pick out his own road. Nor had I any rea|&s;on to repent of my confidence: for, in the bad and dangerous parts of the roads, he never once tripped; where it was &s;moother and &s;afer indeed, he knew he had a licence to be more care|le&s;s.</P>
<P>We came at length to a torrent, which we pa&s;&s;ed by means of a plank that was thrown acro&s;s, after having got our hor&s;es over with &s;ome difficulty: a little way farther we arrived at another, deeper and more violent than the former, over which there was no bridge; not the lea&s;t appearance of any track on the other &s;ide; a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from any habitation; and our guide unac|quainted with the road. After &s;ome ob&s;ervation however we di&s;covered, that the mountain had lately fallen down, and had carried away the path; leaving only a very faint narrow track, that was
<PB N="173" REF="183">
broken off on the &s;ide of the precipice: along which my companions &s;crambled as well as they could upon their hands and knees. While I was cro&s;&s;ing on hor&s;e|back the torrent (which was filled with &s;hattered fragments of rock) I heard a &s;cream; and turning round, &s;aw one of our &s;ervants &s;eized with a panic on the very edge of the precipice, and vehemently ex|claiming, that he could neither get back|wards or forwards. Neverthele&s;s, with &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he got &s;afe over; de|claring, at the &s;ame time, that he would take care never to put him&s;elf again in a &s;imilar &s;ituation. We now regained a kind of path, but &s;o extremely difficult and dangerous, that we thought it mo&s;t prudent to di&s;mount, and leave the hor&s;es to make their way as well as they could. With much difficulty, and af|ter having cro&s;&s;ed &s;everal large drifts of ice and &s;now, the torrents at the &s;ame time rumbling under our feet; we reached, by a very &s;teep a&s;cent, the
<PB N="174" REF="184">
&s;ummit of the valley. A number of rugged and forked rocks, piled one above another, have occa&s;ioned, it is &s;aid, this chain to be called the Mount <HI>Furca.</HI> The country immediately around us was more dreary and de&s;olate than any we had yet &s;een, not excepting even the valley of St. Gothard; all vege|tation &s;eemed to have cea&s;ed: lower down, the mountains were covered with herbage and &s;weet-&s;cented flowers; near us, but higher, on the left, lay a large body of ice, from which i&s;&s;ued a torrent (probably one of the fir&s;t &s;ources of the Rhone) ru&s;hing towards the Vallais. In a word, the &s;everal maje&s;tic objects that pre&s;ented them&s;elves to our view, formed a &s;cene inconceivably a&s;to|ni&s;hing and &s;ublime.</P>
<P>From hence we de&s;cended, &s;cram|bling down broken rocks and craggy precipices for a con&s;iderable way. By this time I was &s;ufficiently tired, to be glad to &s;it down, and take &s;ome refre&s;h|ment,
<PB N="175" REF="185">
con&s;i&s;ting of bread, chee&s;e, and hard eggs; the only provi&s;ion we could procure at Realp. We were &s;eated by a &s;tream of clear water gliding along the &s;ide of the mountain; which indeed was &s;o exceedingly &s;teep, that our hum|ble repa&s;t would have rolled away from us if it not had been well &s;upported. In full view before us was the glacier of the Furca; an immen&s;e ma&s;s of ice, ex|tending in the form of an amphitheatre between two rocks, more &s;hagged, if po&s;&s;ible, than any of the neighbouring mountains: it &s;tretches from their feet, fills up the cha&s;m between them, and reaches almo&s;t even with their &s;ummits. The &s;un &s;hone directly upon it, and made it gli&s;ten like chry&s;tal; while the blue tints, that were occa&s;ionally di&s;|per&s;ed over the ice, appeared inexpre&s;|&s;ibly beautiful. The ice &s;eemed to break in &s;everal parts, as we heard &s;ome loud and deep cracks; the torrent of the Rhone at the &s;ame time roaring beneath.
<PB N="176" REF="186">
That river is chiefly formed by this gla|cier: the &s;mall torrent, I mentioned above, which bur&s;ts out from the up|per body of ice, is joined by &s;everal others; then lo&s;es it&s;elf under the va&s;t arch of ice that forms the bottom of the glacier of the Furca; i&s;&s;ues from thence con&s;iderably augmented, and is the great and principal &s;ource from whence this famous river takes its ri&s;e. The range of mountains on which we were &s;itting, were &s;pread over with bru&s;h-wood and herbage; and &s;ome cat|tle were feeding along the heighths: a fine contra&s;t to the &s;terility of the oppo&s;ite chain; which appeared for &s;ome extent nothing but bare and rugged rock, except where it was covered with ice and frozen &s;now.</P>
<P>After we had fini&s;hed our banquet, and repo&s;ed our&s;elves for a &s;hort time, con|templating the &s;ingularity of the &s;cene before us; we de&s;cended clo&s;e to the bottom of the glacier, where we ad|mired
<PB N="177" REF="187">
the Rhone breaking forth with violence from the bed of ice, near the tre|mendous fragments of a fallen rock. We now followed the cour&s;e of that river, and proceeded down a mountain &s;o ex|ceedingly &s;teep, that the &s;everal parts of the road (which was there paved) winding along its &s;ides, were frequently parallel to each other. The &s;cenery of the vale, which we now entered, was of the &s;ame kind, but more &s;ublime, if po&s;&s;ible, than that of St. Gothard; the Rhone foaming along with amazing rapidity, as it falls in a continual cataract at the foot of &s;ome irregular alps of an im|mea&s;urable heighth. Indeed this cataract is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of any we have yet &s;een, except that of Schaffhau&s;en. We travelled through this vale above two leagues, perpetually a&s;cending or de&s;cending the rugged &s;ides of rocks; one moment clo&s;e to the river, and the next &s;ome hundred yards above it. The grandeur of the&s;e &s;cenes con|tinued
<PB N="178" REF="188">
with infinite variety for a con&s;i|derable way; and (which added greatly to the magnificence and liveline&s;s of the land&s;cape) I counted, in le&s;s than a quarter of a mile, twenty torrents at lea&s;t, which we cro&s;&s;ed. At fir&s;t the rocks were either bare, or &s;tudded here and there with &s;ome &s;traggling pines; but as we advanced, they be|came more and more cloathed with wood and rich verdure: &s;till no traces of any habitation; and we had now gone at lea&s;t fifteen miles, from our fir&s;t quitting the valley of Ur&s;eren, without having &s;een even a &s;hed. I was here &s;o &s;truck with the beauty of the fore&s;ts through which we pa&s;&s;ed, and the luxuriance of the pa&s;ture, that I could not help expre&s;&s;ing my a&s;toni&s;hment that I &s;aw no appear|ance of any habitation in the&s;e delightful &s;pots. I had &s;carce made the remark, when four or five hamlets, &s;ituated on the other &s;ide of the Rhone, upon a beautiful declivity, announced our ap|proach
<PB N="179" REF="189">
to the Vallais. Not long after|wards, we unexpectedly came to an open|ing which gave us an exten&s;ive view of that rich and fertile country, with &s;everal villages here and there di&s;per&s;ed. In this very &s;pot &s;ome pea&s;ant, either by a lucky hit of mere chance, or the happy choice of in&s;tinctive ta&s;te, has built his cottage. Here we quitted the bad road, and de|&s;cended into the Vallais.</P>
<P>We had propo&s;ed pa&s;&s;ing the night at Oberwald; and I was very glad to arrive there, after the fatigues of the day: but, upon enquiry, we found it could &s;upply us with no refre&s;hment. The ma&s;ter of a little hovel, which was called an inn, pointed to a large chee&s;e, and told us That was all the provi&s;ion he had; it was his bread, his fi&s;h, and his meat. Meeting with no better re|ception at Oberge&s;tlen, we continued on to Mun&s;ter; where we did not arrive till late: here we found however an excellent inn for this country, which
<PB N="180" REF="190">
afforded us &s;ome good bread, and even &s;ome meat; but what was far more comfortable to me, a quiet room, and a clean bed.</P>
<P>As we are going to quit this country immediately, and propo&s;e returning into it by the Gemmi; I will defer giving you any account of the government until I &s;hall be better informed.</P>

<P>THE Vallai&s;ans are remarkably attached to their liberty. Upon our quitting Mun&s;ter, this morning, we walked on, and joined company with a pea&s;ant, with whom we had a long conver&s;ation. The countryman a&s;ked us how we liked the country; and, pointing to the mountains, &s;aid: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The&s;e
<PB N="181" REF="191">
are our bulwarks, and they are &s;trong ones too; Con&s;tantinople is not &s;o &s;trongly fortified."</Q> This upper part of the Vallais, I &s;hould imagine, is not much frequented by travellers, if we may judge from the curio&s;ity of the people, who all came out to gaze upon us; and when they di&s;covered that we were Engli&s;hmen, they ob&s;erved us with &s;till more attention. But what particularly &s;urpri&s;ed us was, that the pea&s;ant above-mentioned, a&s;ked us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How our war with the Americans went on?"</Q> It &s;eemed indeed &s;omewhat extraordinary, that a common pea&s;ant of the Vallais, &s;hould know there was &s;uch a place as Con&s;tantinople; but it was more &s;urpri&s;ing &s;till, that he &s;hould ever have heard of the pre&s;ent conte&s;t between Great Britain and her American Colonies.</P>
<P>After returning about a league the &s;ame way we came ye&s;terday, through this fertile and well-cultivated country;
<PB N="182" REF="192">
we left the plain, and a&s;cended the Grim&s;el: one of tho&s;e alps which &s;eparate the Vallais from the canton of Berne. We were near four hours climbing up a &s;teep and craggy road to the &s;ummit; and we &s;hould have con&s;idered the at|tempt to gain it as &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to &s;ucceed, had we not been encouraged by the experience of ye&s;terday. We cro&s;&s;ed the &s;everal &s;hades of vegetation: in the valley, and the lower parts of the mountain, corn and rich meadows; then fore&s;ts of larch and pine; next, &s;hort gra&s;s, together with &s;everal &s;pecies of herbs, that afford exqui&s;ite pa&s;ture to the cattle; to the&s;e &s;ucceeded the various tribe of mo&s;&s;es; and then bare rock and &s;now. It would be curious to con&s;truct, or at lea&s;t to imagine, a &s;cale of vegetation, according to the idea of a French writer, who&s;e name I have forgotten. It would appear from thence, that exce&s;&s;ive cold and exce&s;&s;ive heat are equally pernicious. The tops of the&s;e
<PB N="183" REF="193">
high mountains are barren, and pro|duce no plants; and at certain heighths nothing but mo&s;&s;es will vegetate: the &s;ame is ob&s;erved in climates where the heat is intolerable; as no other vege|table productions are &s;een in the burn|ing &s;ands of Africa. The <HI>mo&s;&s;es</HI> then, which &s;upport the cold better than other plants, would form the fir&s;t de|gree of a &s;cale adju&s;ted to determine how far vegetation accords with the <HI>temperature</HI> of the atmo&s;phere. The &s;ame family of plants, as it &s;upports al&s;o the heat much better than any other, would occupy the la&s;t degree in the &s;cale above-mentioned. Thus the two extremes touch one another &s;ur|pri&s;ingly.</P>
<P>From the top of the Grim&s;el we de|&s;cended about two miles, and arrived at a &s;mall plain or hollow in the mid&s;t of the mountains; containing one &s;oli|tary hovel: and from this hovel I am now writing to you. It made &s;o bad
<PB N="184" REF="194">
an appearance at fir&s;t &s;ight, that we concluded we &s;hould get nothing to eat: we were, however, very agreeably di&s;appointed; as we have found in this de&s;art &s;pot all the accommodations we could wi&s;h for, except beds; and the&s;e are the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, after the &s;ound &s;leep we had la&s;t night. Not to mention excellent chee&s;e, butter, and milk (our ordinary fare) we got &s;ome good wine, a &s;mall portion of kid, and a boiled <HI>marmote,</HI> which we have ju&s;t devoured; although at another time we &s;hould have revolted at the very idea. The landlord is &s;tationed in this for|lorn region by the canton of Berne, and he re&s;ides in it about four months; the roads being almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able the remaining eight: his bu&s;ine&s;s is to re|ceive all travellers; but upon condi|tion, however, that they pay for their accommodations. When he quits the place, he leaves a certain quantity of chee&s;e, hard bread, &s;alted provi&s;ion, and
<PB N="185" REF="195">
fuel, in ca&s;e any unfortunate wanderer &s;hould happen to come this way, when the winter has &s;et in: and we ob&s;erved long poles fixed on both &s;ides of the track, at &s;mall di&s;tances from each other, in order to point out the path to pa&s;&s;engers, who may chance to pa&s;s this mountain, after the &s;nows have begun to fall. Near the hou&s;e, upon the top of a &s;mall rock, our ho&s;t has made a kind of little garden, by bringing &s;ome earth from the neighbouring pa&s;tures: and this &s;mall bit of ground &s;upplies him tolerably well with turnips, cab|bages, and &s;ome other vegetables; al|though, on account of the heighth of the circumjacent mountains, it does not long enjoy the warmth of the &s;un.</P>
<P>Numerous herds of goats are kept, during the &s;ummer months, upon the&s;e mountains: they are let out every morning to feed upon the rich pa&s;|tures; and return every evening be|fore &s;un-&s;et to be milked and hou&s;ed.
<PB N="186" REF="196">
It was a plea&s;ing &s;ight to ob&s;erve them all marching homeward in the &s;ame herd; and following one another down the broken precipices, and along the rugged &s;ides of the rocks: their milk is delicious.</P>
<P>This hovel (be&s;ides the &s;tore-hou&s;es for the chee&s;es, of which they make here a large quantity, and of a mo&s;t excellent &s;ort) contains only a &s;mall kitchen, and one room, in which we are now &s;itting. We occupy nearly one &s;ide of it; the other is taken up by our &s;ervants, the landlord and his wife, and half a dozen hone&s;t labourers: the latter are eating their homely &s;upper, with all the reli&s;h that well-earned hunger can give; and are enjoying a &s;hort re&s;pite from their toil, with that noi&s;y mirth which characteri&s;es the gaiety of this cla&s;s of people.</P>
<P>The &s;ources of the river Aar are in the&s;e mountains. Near our hovel are two lakes; and farther on a larger
<PB N="187" REF="197">
one: from each of the&s;e flow ca&s;cades, that fall into the Aar, which rolls down in an impetuous torrent from the neigh|bouring glaciers. I walked by the &s;ide of that river while dinner was getting ready, &s;earching for chry&s;tals; which are very common in the&s;e parts: we picked up pieces of divers colours, white, black, yellow, and green. Not far from hence are &s;everal very curious mines of chry&s;tal: I regretted much that I had not time to vi&s;it them. The&s;e moun|tains certainly abound al&s;o in rich veins of gold, and other metals; a con|&s;iderable quantity of gold-du&s;t being found in the bed of the Aar, and in the various torrents. I can conceive nothing more fatal to the intere&s;ts of Swi&s;&s;erland, nor more repugnant to the liberties of the people, than to have the&s;e mines of gold or &s;ilver traced and opened. A &s;udden overflow of riches would effectually change and corrupt their manners: and it is an inconte&s;|table
<PB N="188" REF="198">
truth, that the real power of a country, not ambitious of making con|que&s;ts, is derived le&s;s from the wealth than from the indu&s;try of its &s;ubjects; the happine&s;s of a people, as well as of an individual, con&s;i&s;ting in being contented.</P>

<P>I Found the cold upon the Grim&s;el more piercing than I had experi|enced upon the top of St. Gothard; and la&s;t night I &s;uffered &s;o much from it, as &s;carcely to &s;leep one minute. But then circum&s;tances were &s;omewhat different

<P>We are now in the di&s;trict of Ha&s;li, which makes a part of the canton of Berne: it is enclo&s;ed on all &s;ides by the mountains Grim&s;el, Wetterhorn, Shereckhorn, Brunig, &amp;c. the highe&s;t alps of Swi&s;&s;erland; and of the&s;e the Shereckhorn is the mo&s;t elevated. We pa&s;&s;ed through an uninterrupted chain of alps, following the cour&s;e of the Aar: all around us, for &s;ome way, was wild, and uninhabitable. The whole &s;urface of what little vale there was between the ranges of mountains, was &s;trewed thick with va&s;t fragments of rock; while tho&s;e, which &s;till hung on the &s;ides of the mountains, &s;eemed threatning to tumble upon our heads;

This valley exhibits the &s;ame kind of &s;cenes we have been long accu&s;tomed to; except that the Aar ru&s;hes with more impetuous rage even than the Rhone or the Reu&s;s; and is frequently &s;o &s;welled with the torrents it receives in its cour&s;e, as to ravage all the adjacent country: we &s;aw many marks of the&s;e terrible de|va&s;tations. We cro&s;&s;ed it in &s;everal places; in one of which the land&s;cape was very much of the &s;ame dreary kind as that of the Devil's Bridge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 160.</NOTE>. Near the &s;mall village of Hundeck, about three leagues from Spital, we had a glimp&s;e, through the trees, of the Aar falling from a con&s;iderable heighth. In order to gain a nearer view of it, we climbed along the &s;ides of a rock, which happened very luckily to be well covered with mo&s;s, otherwi&s;e, from its &s;teepne&s;s, it would not have

been practicable: I leaned again&s;t a tree that hung over the precipice, and &s;aw the river ru&s;hing all at once as if from a crevice of the rock, and then &s;preading into a kind of &s;emicircular expan&s;ion in its de&s;cent. It fell with fury into a deep and narrow channel, and then lo&s;t it&s;elf in the mid&s;t of the fore&s;t. The river was very full, and its perpendicular fall, as far as I could judge by the eye, might be about 150 feet. The &s;cenery al&s;o was &s;olemnly maje&s;tic; the rocks on each &s;ide ri&s;ing perpendicularly, and totally bare, ex|cept their tops, which were crowned with pines.</P>
<P>Great part of this land of Ha&s;li is extremely fertile, and well wooded: we traver&s;ed in our way to Meyringen large fore&s;ts of beech and pines, the Aar roaring along the vale; and the road, which was as craggy and as rugged as u&s;ual, ince&s;&s;antly a&s;cending and de&s;cend|ing. We now pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal
<PB N="192" REF="202">
&s;mall villages, which afforded us a plea&s;|ing &s;ight, after the de&s;olated country we had &s;o lately been accu&s;tomed to; and came into a beautiful little vale of a mo&s;t lively verdure, and delightfully planted. All here was calmne&s;s and repo&s;e: neither rapid river nor roaring torrent to interrupt the unu&s;ual &s;tillne&s;s and tranquillity of the &s;cene. This &s;hort interval of &s;ilence, made us the more &s;en&s;ibly affected by the turbulence of the Aar and the loud clamour of the cataracts.</P>
<P>We have now &s;een the three greate7s;t rivers in Swi&s;&s;erland (the Rhine excepted) i&s;&s;uing from their re&s;pective &s;ources; and have traced them in all their vio|lence through a tract of country in which Nature has exhibited &s;ome of the grande&s;t and mo&s;t augu&s;t of her works. But how impo&s;&s;ible have I found it to convey to you an adequate idea of the&s;e her maje&s;tic, variegated, and a&s;toni&s;h|ing &s;cenes! They mu&s;t all of them upon paper nece&s;&s;arily appear much the &s;ame:
<PB N="193" REF="203">
yet, in fact, every river and cataract, every rock, mountain, and precipice, are re&s;pectively di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by an infinite diver&s;ity of modifications, and by all the po&s;&s;ible forms of beau|ty, or magnificence; of &s;ublimity, or horror. But the&s;e di&s;criminating va|riations, though too vi&s;ibly marked to e&s;cape even the lea&s;t ob&s;erving eye, elude every kind of repre&s;entation, and defy the &s;tronge&s;t powers both of the pen and the pencil. In a word, you mu&s;t not judge of the beauties of this ro|mantic country, from the faint &s;ketches I have attempted to delineate: for, upon the whole, they can no more con|vey to you a complete and perfect idea of the&s;e wonderful &s;cenes, than if I were to aim at giving you &s;ome notion of the pictures of Raphael and Corregio, by telling you, they are compo&s;ed of paint and canvas.</P>
<P>Meyringen is a large neat village, being the capital burgh of this land of
<PB N="194" REF="204">
Ha&s;li: a di&s;trict which enjoys con&s;ider|able privileges. There is no bailiff appointed by the government of Berne over any part of this territory, but the people are governed by their own ma|gi&s;trates: the former, however, as well as the latter, are obliged to take oaths of fidelity to the &s;overeign council of Berne. All the authority, which the bailiffs in the other parts of this canton enjoy, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a great mea&s;ure by the Landamman; with this re&s;erve however, that he is &s;ubject to the in|&s;pection of the bailiff of Interlaken, to whom he delivers in his accounts. He re&s;ides here, and is appointed by the &s;overeign council from among the in|habitants: he continues in charge &s;ix years. All the other magi&s;trates (ex|cept the judge and the &s;ecretary) are elected by the people, who a&s;&s;emble every four years. The&s;e privileges are the more remarkable in an ari&s;tocracy, like that of Berne, where the council of two
<PB N="195" REF="205">
hundred are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;overeign and unlimited power. In this di&s;trict there are about 6,000 men capable of bearing arms, and about 20,000 &s;ouls.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are a very fine race of people: the men in general re|markably &s;trong, lu&s;ty, and well made; the women tall and hand&s;ome. The latter have an elegant manner of wear|ing their hair, which is commonly of a beautiful colour: it is parted from the top of the forehead, from thence brought round and joined to the locks behind; which either hang down their back in long tre&s;&s;es, braided with rib|band, or are woven round the head in a &s;imple plait. But the other part of the dre&s;s does not in the lea&s;t corre&s;pond with this elegance; as their &s;hapes, na|turally fine, are &s;poiled by an ab&s;urd fa&s;hion of wearing their petticoats &s;o high, that they all appear as if they were round-&s;houldered and big-bellied.</P>
<P>Meyringen is &s;ituated near the Aar,
<PB N="196" REF="206">
in a very romantic valley; &s;urrounded by meadows of a mo&s;t luxuriant ver|dure, &s;prinkled with cottages, which are occa&s;ionally &s;eparated from each other by huge intervening &s;tones and deep channels, the remaining effects of &s;torms and torrents. Clo&s;e to the village, the Alp-bach, a torrent &s;o called, falls from the mountain Hou&s;li, in two beautiful perpendicular ca&s;cades, but with &s;o much violence, and in &s;o large a body of water, as to cau&s;e frequent inunda|tions: indeed the burgh it&s;elf has been in danger of being overwhelmed and de&s;troyed by its repeated ravages; again&s;t which, however, it is now protected, by a wall of a con&s;iderable heighth and &s;o|lidity. Near this torrent is another fall of water, that glides gently down the bare rock, which is there more &s;loping; and, farther on, a third gli&s;tened as it de&s;cended through a hanging grove of pines, that feather the &s;ides of the moun|tain.</P>

<P>By this you will perceive, that, in pro|portion, bread is much dearer than the other articles; and the rea&s;on is obvious: for, all the&s;e mountainous parts con&s;i&s;t almo&s;t entirely of pa&s;turages, and pro|duce little corn. The pea&s;ants of Swi&s;|&s;erland (I mean tho&s;e who inhabit the mountainous di&s;tricts) live chiefly upon milk, and what re&s;ults from it, together with potatoes, which are here much

cultivated. According to the price of provi&s;ions in England, the above li&s;t will appear exceedingly cheap: but then it ought at the &s;ame time to be con&s;i|dered, that money is very &s;carce in the&s;e parts. Nor indeed is it &s;o much ne|ce&s;&s;ary in a country, where there is no luxury; where all the pea&s;antry have, within them&s;elves, more than &s;ufficient for their own con&s;umption; and are tolerably well provided with every ne|ce&s;&s;ary of life from their own little deme&s;nes. I had, to-day, a long con|ver&s;ation with one of the lads, who came with us from Altdorf, and takes care of the hor&s;es. He lives upon the moun|tains of Uri; and, as their winter la&s;ts near eight months of the year, during &s;ome part of which time there can be little communication between the &s;everal cottages, every family is of cour&s;e obliged to lay in their provi&s;ion for the whole winter. His own, it &s;eems, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;even per&s;ons, and is provided with the
<PB N="199" REF="209">
following &s;tores: &s;even chee&s;es, each weighing twenty-five pounds; an hun|dred and eight pounds of hard bread, twenty-five ba&s;kets of potatoes, each weighing about forty pounds; &s;even goats, and three cows, one of which they kill. The cows and hor&s;es (if they keep any) are fed with hay, and the goats with the boughs of firs; which, in a &s;carcity of hay, they give al&s;o to their other cattle. During this dreary &s;ea&s;on the family are employed in mak|ing linen, &s;hirts, &amp;c. &s;ufficient for their own u&s;e: and, for this purpo&s;e, a &s;mall patch of the little piece of ground be|longing to every cottage, is generally &s;own with flax. The cultivation of the latter has been much attended to, and with increa&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s, in the&s;e moun|tainous parts of Swi&s;&s;erland.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es (as I ob&s;erved to you be|fore, in my letters relating to Appenzel and Glaris) are generally built of wood; and it was a natural remark of one of
<PB N="200" REF="210">
our &s;ervants, as we pa&s;&s;ed through &s;uch a continued chain of rocks; that as there was &s;tone enough to build all the cottages in the country, it was wonder|ful they &s;hould u&s;e nothing but wood for that purpo&s;e: a remark that has been made by many travellers. But it &s;hould &s;eem, that the&s;e wooden hou&s;es are much &s;ooner con&s;tructed, and are ea&s;ily repaired; that they are built in &s;o &s;olid and compact a manner (the rooms &s;mall, and the ceilings low) as to be &s;ufficiently warm even for &s;o cold a cli|mate. The chief objection to them ari&s;es from the danger of fire; as the flames mu&s;t rage with great rapidity, and communicate ea&s;ily from one to the other. This inconvenience, however, is in a great mea&s;ure obviated by the me|thod of building their cottages apart; all their villages con&s;i&s;ting of detached and &s;cattered hamlets. This ob&s;erva|tion, however, does not hold with re|&s;pect to &s;ome of their large&s;t burghs:

<P>WE left Meyringen this morning, cro&s;&s;ed the Aar, and mounted the Scheideck through a beautiful fore&s;t of beech, poplars, mountain-a&s;h, and pines: in our way we pa&s;&s;ed by the Reichenbach, a torrent celebrated for the beauty and impetuo&s;ity of its fall: it glides for &s;ome way down the &s;ides of the mountain; then ru&s;hes perpendicu|larly into a deep gulph, it has &s;cooped for it&s;elf in a quarry of black marble; and from thence, after forming in its cour&s;e &s;everal &s;maller ca&s;cades, flows into the Aar.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="212">
After a&s;cending about three hours, we refre&s;hed our&s;elves and our hor&s;es in a delightful vale &s;trewed with ham|lets; a &s;loping hill, adorned with varie|gated verdure, on one &s;ide; va&s;t impend|ing rocks lifting their heads into the clouds, on the other; and a beautiful pyramidical mountain covered with &s;now, ri&s;ing before us. As we were taking our repa&s;t, we were &s;uddenly &s;tartled by a noi&s;e, like the &s;ound of thunder; we &s;oon found that it was occa&s;ioned by the falling of a large body of &s;now from the top of the mountain, which, in its precipitate de&s;cent had very much the appearance of a torrent of water re|duced almo&s;t into &s;pray. The&s;e <HI>la|vanges</HI> (as they are called) are &s;ometimes attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;e|quences: for, when they con&s;i&s;t of enormous ma&s;&s;es, they de&s;troy every thing in their cour&s;e; and there have been in&s;tances of their overwhelming even a whole village. The one we &s;aw
<PB N="203" REF="213">
was very trifling; but it was &s;ufficient however to give us &s;ome idea of tho&s;e, which are more con&s;iderable. The be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t the effects of the&s;e <HI>lavanges</HI> being the fore&s;ts, with which the alps of Swi&s;&s;erland &s;o remarkably a|bound; there is &s;carce a village, if &s;itu|ated at the foot of a mountain, but what is &s;heltered by one of them: and the inhabitants pre&s;erve them with pe|culiar reverence, as their common pro|tector. Thus, what con&s;titutes one of the principal beauties of the country, affords al&s;o the greate&s;t &s;ecurity to the people.</P>
<P>The de&s;cent from hence to Grindel|wald was long and tedious: that village, con&s;i&s;ting of a number of cottages, &s;cattered over the plain and upon the ri&s;ing hills, exhibits a &s;cene wonderfully agreeable and picture&s;que, heightened at the &s;ame time by a view of the gla|cier. The latter, &s;tretching from the &s;ummit of the mountain to the extre|mity
<PB N="204" REF="214">
of the plain in a regular curve, is beautifully &s;kirted with wood; and within a few paces of it, on each &s;ide, are fields of oats, barley, and rich mea|dows&mdash;but I am going to anticipate the de&s;cription I purpo&s;e to give you upon a nearer view; and &s;o good night.</P>
<P><DATE>Augu&s;t 14.</DATE></P>
<P>Dare I confe&s;s to you, that I am &s;omewhat di&s;appointed, and that a nearer view of the glacier has not &s;ufficiently compen&s;ated for the fatigue and trouble of the expedition? But I have promi&s;ed to write from my own feelings, and not to &s;end you an ac|count taken from the exaggerated de|&s;criptions of others.&mdash;We &s;allied out this morning full of impatience and expectation; and arrived at the bottom of the glacier, forming a va&s;t maje&s;tic arch of ice; from whence i&s;&s;ued a mo&s;t loud torrent of &s;now-water ju&s;t melted. This glacier is compo&s;ed of an infinite
<PB N="205" REF="215">
number of pyramids ri&s;ing from the bed of ice, which are more elevated towards the plain; being from about 40 to 60 feet high, and &s;hortening as you a&s;cend, until they terminate in a broad &s;urface broken into deep and wide clefts. We were above two hours in mounting a very difficult path at the edge of the frozen region, occa&s;ionally pa&s;&s;ing over the &s;teep and craggy parts of rock almo&s;t perpendicular, along the very &s;ides of the precipice: the danger of which makes me &s;hudder even now. This glacier, as we were informed, joins to a very exten&s;ive valley of ice, about 12 leagues in length, and &s;ituat|ed between two chains of elevated alps.</P>
<P>After having a&s;cended thus far, we were &s;topped by almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able moun|tains and a ri&s;ing hill of ice; our guide (who by the way was very &s;tupid, and did not &s;eem to under&s;tand his profe&s;|&s;ion) a&s;&s;uring us at the &s;ame time, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to proceed any farther.
<PB N="206" REF="216">
Of this we were by no means convinc|ed; but not having any conductor with us who could lead us the way, and not daring to explore the&s;e unknown re|gions by our&s;elves, we de&s;cended with heavy hearts; much chagrined, that what we had &s;een (though certainly a very curious and &s;ublime &s;ight) did not come up to what we had been taught to expect: and yet every one here, as well as our guide, a&s;&s;ures us, that no travel|lers have penetrated farther. One rea|&s;on, I believe, why this glacier is more particularly &s;poken of than others, is, that a very good view may be had of it without the trouble of a&s;cending. In that part between the mountains, now occupied by this glacier, there was for|merly a road which communicated with the Vallais, but is at pre&s;ent impa&s;&s;able; and we were &s;hewn a &s;pot, now covered with ice, where &s;ome years ago there &s;tood a &s;mall chapel.</P>
<P>What peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hes the
<PB N="207" REF="217">
glacier I have been mentioning from that of the <HI>Furca,</HI> is, that the latter lies amid&s;t barren and craggy rocks, in a mo&s;t de&s;olate, dreary, and uninhabited country; whereas this joins to a very fertile plain, and borders upon cultiva|tion: in other re&s;pects the <HI>Furca,</HI> con|&s;idered independently of its &s;ituation, was a more &s;triking object. Not far from this glacier, pines, willows, a&s;h, and oaks, grow and come to perfection: potatoes al&s;o, together with beans, beet|root, and turnips are here produced; and near the borders of the ice I gather|ed &s;ome &s;trawberries and wild cherries, and ob&s;erved hazel - nuts, barberries, and mulberry trees. The valley of Grindelwald is extremely fertile; it pro|duces barley, rye, hay, hemp, and fruit|trees in great abundance: above 2,000 head of large cattle, and near 3,000 of &s;mall are here fed.</P>
<P>It has frequently been ob&s;erved, that on con&s;iderable elevations, and more
<PB N="208" REF="218">
particularly upon the glaciers, one finds a difficulty of breathing: a circum&s;tance which has been imputed to the rare|faction of the air. This however was &s;o far from being confirmed by our own experience, that I can venture to deny the fact. For in all our expeditions upon the Swi&s;s alps, as well as in this of to-day upon the glacier, neither I nor any of the company ever felt the lea&s;t difficulty of breathing; but on the contrary &s;eemed to enjoy a more ea&s;y re&s;piration: we all appeared more free in our motions, more light, and not in the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible of any inconvenience, except what aro&s;e from the piercing cold. Indeed in mounting the &s;ides of a &s;teep and craggy rock, the fatigue is &s;o great that one is &s;oon exhau&s;ted, and obliged to &s;top occa&s;ionally in order to take breath: but this is only the effect of violent exertion; and &s;o far from being cau&s;ed by the elevation, that we found the higher we a&s;cended, the more
<PB N="209" REF="219">
we became refre&s;hed. It is certain, that were this pretended difficulty of re&s;pira|tion produced by any &s;ubtlety of the air; that cau&s;e would at lea&s;t act uni|formly, and occa&s;ion the &s;ame effects on all con&s;iderable heighths. But as we did not experience the&s;e effects; we may fairly conclude it to be an error ad|vanced ha&s;tily by &s;ome travellers, and adopted by others who had never been out of the plain.</P>

<P>THE road from Grindelwald to this place is &s;ingularly good, and we met, what to us is become a remarkable object, a cart in our way; as we have not &s;een any thing that moves upon wheels &s;ince we left Lucerne. The country was
<PB N="210" REF="220">
mo&s;t &s;upremely delightful: beautiful hanging woods, immen&s;e rocks, deep precipices, and violent torrents. But I &s;uppo&s;e you are by this time as much accu&s;tomed to rocks, precipices, and torrents, as the readers of Fingal to blue mi&s;ts and hollow winds.</P>
<P>This vale of Lauterbrunnen, is in|clo&s;ed between two chains of high per|pendicular alps; the highe&s;t of which, is called the <HI>Jungfrau-horn,</HI> or the vir|gin's horn. The etymology u&s;ually given of this word, is, that it takes its name of <HI>virgin,</HI> from its top being in|acce&s;&s;ible: but this circum&s;tance is by no means peculiar to this particular mountain; and I much &s;u&s;pect that its appellation is derived from very high antiquity. For, it is a well-known fact, that mountains and promontories pre|&s;erve their original names, while towns, and even tracts of country, frequently change theirs with new inhabitants. It is therefore from the former, as well
<PB N="211" REF="221">
as from the latter, that the antiquarian &s;hould endeavour to trace the antiquity of any country. It mu&s;t however be confe&s;&s;ed, that if the&s;e etymologies are not in &s;ome mea&s;ure corroborated by collateral hi&s;torical evidence, they are generally vague and uncertain; more calculated to di&s;play the ingenuity of the etymologi&s;t, than to throw any &s;atis|factory light upon his re&s;earches. In &s;hort, it is only when hi&s;tory and ety|mology go hand in hand, that they &s;erve to &s;trengthen and &s;upport each other. It is thus that my very learned and worthy friend Mr. Bryant, in his late admirable performance, has rendered his etymological enquiries &s;ub&s;ervient to, and corroborated by, hi&s;tory; and with &s;o much clearne&s;s, as to carry the fulle&s;t conviction to his reader. Were he now with me, I am per&s;uaded he would give me a much better etymology of the names of the Swi&s;s mountains, than tho&s;e which I have hitherto met with:
<PB N="212" REF="222">
&s;uch as the <HI>Jungfrau-horn</HI> above-men|tioned; or that of the <HI>Gemmi,</HI> which is generally deduced from <HI>Gemo,</HI> to groan, becau&s;e from its &s;teepne&s;s the travel|ler groans as he a&s;cends; or from <HI>Gemini,</HI> becau&s;e there are two rocks in that chain of mountains, which re&s;em|ble each other. Whereas it is more probable, that the mountain in que&s;|tion was thus called, long before the exi&s;tence of the Latin language.</P>
<P>We are now lodged at the hou&s;e of the clergyman of Lauterbrunnen; a little village, or rather collection of cot|tages &s;prinkled, like tho&s;e of Grindel|wald, about the valley and acce&s;&s;ible parts of the hills. Near the hou&s;e, is the celebrated fall of the <HI>Staubbach,</HI> which I am ju&s;t returned from viewing. This torrent precipitates perpendicu|larly from a con&s;iderable heighth, and re&s;olves it&s;elf into fine &s;pray: the great|e&s;t part of it falls clear of the over|hanging mountain, during its whole
<PB N="213" REF="223">
de&s;cent; but the remainder da&s;hes a|bout half way again&s;t a projection from the rock, and flies off with inconceiv|able violence. The clergyman mea&s;ur|ed, a &s;hort time ago, the perpendicular heighth of this fall, and found it 930 feet. The &s;un &s;hining full upon it, formed towards the bottom of the fall a miniature rainbow extremely bright: while I &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance, the rain|bow a&s;&s;umed a &s;emicircular figure; as I approached, the extreme points gra|dually coincided, and formed a com|plete circle of the mo&s;t lively and brilliant colours. In order to have a &s;till finer view, I ventured nearer and nearer; the circle at the &s;ame time becoming &s;maller and &s;maller; and as I &s;tood quite under the fall, it &s;uddenly di&s;appeared. When I looked up to the torrent, in this &s;itua|tion, it re&s;embled a cloud of du&s;t: and from this circum&s;tance indeed it takes its name; <HI>Staubbach</HI> &s;ignifying, in the German language, a &s;pring of du&s;t.

I paid for my curio&s;ity, by getting wet to the &s;kin; but then I had the <HI>&s;in|gular</HI> &s;atisfaction, at the &s;ame time, of &s;eeing a rainbow in miniature: no uncommon phaenomenon, you know, as it may be ob&s;erved in any ca&s;cade, upon which the &s;un &s;hines directly in a certain po&s;ition. In the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance, however, it was &s;ome con&s;ola|tion to me, under my <HI>dripping</HI> circum|&s;tances, that the object happened to be peculiarly &s;triking.

<P>We rode ye&s;terday morning to the extremity of the vale, in which there are &s;ome points of view as fine as any I have yet &s;een in Swi&s;&s;erland. In our way we had a glimp&s;e of a &s;uperior fall of the Staubbach, divided into two &s;treams; which, afterwards uniting, form the &s;econd perpendicular ca&s;cade ju&s;t mentioned. In this valley there
<PB N="215" REF="225">
are &s;everal fountains of the cleare&s;t water, that gu&s;h from the earth, and numberle&s;s torrents which precipitate them&s;elves from the mountains; two in particular which fall from a greater heighth than even the Staubbach, but as their de&s;cent is not &s;o direct, they are le&s;s beautiful.</P>
<P>The a&s;cent to the&s;e glaciers is not altogether &s;o dangerous as that at Grin|delwald; though upon the whole, it is more &s;teep and more fatiguing. After mounting above three hours, we ar|rived at a &s;mall hut, which in &s;um|mer is inhabited by herd&s;men, who make there mo&s;t excellent chee&s;es, and have numerous herds of cows, goats, and &s;wine. Here we fea&s;ted upon cold chamois, which our ho&s;t had pro|vided for us, not to mention a de|licious de&s;ert of admirable cream and chee&s;e. From hence we a&s;cended &s;till farther, with con&s;iderable difficulty, un|til we were &s;urrounded by mountains,
<PB N="216" REF="226">
which we were told were ab&s;olutely im|pa&s;&s;able. We wi&s;hed to proceed; but our ho&s;t a&s;&s;ured us, we had but ju&s;t time to return before night; and that no &s;trangers, except four of our country|men, had ever gone &s;o far. Here then we &s;at down clo&s;e to the ice, and en|joyed a fine view of the glacier and mountains before us.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e mountains, the <HI>Gro&s;s-horn,</HI> is pyramidical, and covered with frozen &s;now; another, the <HI>Breit-horn,</HI> is conical, of a &s;tupendous heighth, and crowned with an enormous ma&s;s of pure tran&s;parent ice, from which the reflec|tion of the &s;un's beams was inexpre&s;|&s;ibly beautiful. The hollows between the&s;e mountains were filled with a large body of ice, broken into the greate&s;t variety of &s;hapes imaginable: and &s;eve|ral torrents (of which the Schmadi|brunnen is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable) bur&s;t|ing from the &s;now, and uniting in their cour&s;e, form the Gletcher; a river which
<PB N="217" REF="227">
flows through the vale of Lauterbrun|nen, receives the Staubbach, and falls into the Aar.</P>
<P>The whole &s;cenery was exceedingly magnificent; and exhibited a mo&s;t cu|rious and &s;ingular picture, e&s;pecially to one not accu&s;tomed to &s;ee ice and &s;now in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, bordering upon verdant groves and rich meadows. But yet the ideas we had conceived of this wonderful land&s;cape, from the ex|aggerated de&s;criptions of others, have not been &s;ufficiently an&s;wered; nor was it much worth the trouble of climbing &s;o far, as we had almo&s;t as perfect a view of the glacier from the hut above|mentioned. Every thing in Swi&s;&s;er|land has more than gratified our ex|pectations, except the <HI>glaciers;</HI> and yet the&s;e are certainly the mo&s;t &s;ublime and the mo&s;t intere&s;ting natural phaenomena in the whole country. The truth is, from the accounts we had heard and read of them, our imaginations had been rai&s;ed
<PB N="218" REF="228">
too high: and we were led to &s;uppo&s;e, that what we had &s;een in the Furca was much inferior in extent or magni|tude, to what we &s;hould &s;ee in the&s;e parts; whereas in fact the latter was in all re&s;pects equal to whatever of the &s;ame kind we have &s;ince vi&s;ited. I am apt, however, to believe, that our di&s;|appointment, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, aro&s;e from the ignorance of our guides: and indeed I have no doubt, if it had been our good fortune to have been better conducted, we might, with &s;ome per|&s;everance, have penetrated farther into the upper regions of the&s;e mountains; and have found our mo&s;t &s;anguine ex|pectations in no re&s;pect di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>The higher and more inacce&s;&s;ible parts of the&s;e alps, are inhabited by the <HI>bouquetin</HI> and the <HI>chamois;</HI> who&s;e activity in &s;couring along the &s;teep and craggy rocks, and in leaping over the precipices, is by all accounts &s;carcely conceivable.
<PB N="219" REF="229">
The blood of both the&s;e animals is of &s;o hot a nature, that the inhabitants of the&s;e mountains, who are all of them &s;ubject to pleuri&s;ies, take a few drops of it, mixed with water, as a remedy for that di&s;order. The fle&s;h of the chamois is much e&s;teemed here; and to us it appeared delicious, &s;ea&s;oned as it was with hunger.</P>
<P>The&s;e mountains are covered to a con&s;iderable heighth with a rich and de|lightful verdure; and we &s;aw upon their tops, at &s;ome di&s;tance, &s;everal little villages, the acce&s;s to which mu&s;t have been almo&s;t as difficult as to the&s;e glaciers.</P>
<P>Upon our return from our expedi|tion, our ho&s;t fea&s;ted us with a mo&s;t excellent &s;upper: among other articles, there was the be&s;t ham I ever ta&s;ted. The &s;wine in the&s;e parts are uncom|monly fat; in &s;ummer they feed en|tirely upon the gra&s;s and wild herbs they find on the mountains, and never ta&s;te any milk.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="230">
The clergyman and his wife, with whom we are lodged, are very &s;ingular characters: both of them immoderate talkers, but each &s;trongly marked with good-nature and benevolence; and &s;o very de&s;irous to oblige, and to furni&s;h us with every po&s;&s;ible convenience, that their civility is ab&s;olutely embarra&s;&s;ing. Indeed we were much concerned upon being informed, that the good woman, who is big with child, had &s;at up all night to make bread and cakes, and to prepare &s;ome other provi&s;ion to carry with us in our excur&s;ion to the gla|cier: and, what was &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing, &s;he would wait upon us at &s;upper, notwith&s;tanding all our entreaties to the contrary. This good couple have &s;everal children; and their circum&s;tances cannot be very ea&s;y, as the livings in the canton of Berne are extremely mo|derate; and this is not one of the be&s;t. From this con&s;ideration, tho&s;e travellers who are lodged in their

<P>WHEN we were upon the Lau|terbrunnen glaciers, we were within three leagues of this place; but the mountains being, as we were in|formed, impa&s;&s;able, we were obliged to make a circuit of forty miles: I have no objection, however, to the&s;e round|about ways, as by that means we have an opportunity of &s;eeing more of the &s;ub|lime &s;cenery of this wonderful country.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="232">
We had quitted the Aar at Mey|ringen, and now joined it again about two leagues from Lauterbrunnen, flow|ing through a fertile plain, which lies between the two lakes of Brientz and Thun, and i&s;&s;uing from the former. We followed its cour&s;e until it entered the lake of Thun, &s;o called from a town of that name, &s;ituated upon its north-we&s;tern extremity. This lake is about four leagues long and one broad; and, if we may judge from the &s;teep|ne&s;s of the mountains with which it is bounded, mu&s;t be very deep: the bor|ders are richly variegated; and pre&s;ent &s;everal fine points of view, greatly heightened by &s;ome pyramidical rocks ri&s;ing boldly from the edge of the water. We coa&s;ted this lake, through a de|lightful country, to the &s;mall village of Lei&s;ingen; mounted up to another called Ae&s;chi, from whence we looked down upon the whole lake of Thun, and part of the lake of Brientz, at a
<PB N="223" REF="233">
&s;mall di&s;tance: then entered the rich vale of Frutigen, parallel to that of Lauterbrunnen, and enjoyed, for a con|&s;iderable way, a pro&s;pect of tho&s;e gla|ciers we had vi&s;ited the day before.</P>
<P>This vale ends at the town of Fru|tigen: from thence commences that of Kander, with a river of the &s;ame name running through it towards the lake of Thun, and bounded by an exceed|ing high mountain called Kander&s;teg. In all the&s;e vales, the rudene&s;s and heighth of the mountains, which almo&s;t &s;hut in upon them, contra&s;ted with the beauty and fruitfulne&s;s of the plains, which are always watered by &s;ome lively torrent, form a thou&s;and pic|ture&s;que &s;cenes, ever changing, and im|po&s;&s;ible to be de&s;cribed: and they are &s;till farther embelli&s;hed by the number of ruined ca&s;tles perched upon points &s;eemingly inacce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The road continued good as far as the &s;mall village of Kander&s;teg; and
<PB N="224" REF="234">
from thence delicate travellers, who do not chu&s;e to mount a rugged a&s;cent, either on foot or on hor&s;e|back, are carried in a kind of arm-chair placed by means of poles upon men's &s;houlders. We proceeded, however, on hor&s;eback, having before rode up &s;teeper and more difficult paths. After having a&s;cended above two hours, we came to a &s;ingle hou&s;e, not far from the top of the mountain, where we got &s;ome refre&s;hment: here we &s;aw no|thing but immen&s;e rocks piled upon one another, with no appearance of vege|tation; and the weather was exceed|ingly cold. We then pa&s;&s;ed over a large drift of &s;now, and came to a lake called the Dauben See, about a league in circumference, &s;upplied by a con&s;iderable torrent from a neighbour|ing glacier. This lake has no vi&s;ible outlet; but it evidently finds a pa&s;|&s;age under ground into the <HI>Vallais,</HI> about &s;ix leagues off, as that current cea&s;es to flow when the lake is frozen.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="235">
This chain of mountains, which &s;e|parates the canton of Berne from the Vallais, is called the Gemmi: from the point of which, over-looking and al|mo&s;t over-hanging the Vallais, we had at once a mo&s;t exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of that country, and of the Savoy gla|ciers; but what principally attracted our admiration, was the <HI>Mont Blanc,</HI> ri&s;ing above the re&s;t in the mo&s;t &s;tately and maje&s;tic form. It is a conical mountain, of &s;tupendous heighth; and &s;eemed to have a glittering crown of pure ice upon its &s;ummit. The moun|tain which we de&s;cended, is in many places almo&s;t ab&s;olutely perpendicular; and yet a hor&s;e-road has been cut out of the hard rock down this very for|midable de&s;cent. This road was begun in 1736, and fini&s;hed in 1741, at the joint expence of the Vallais, and the canton of Berne: an a&s;toni&s;hing work! and proves that nothing is impracti|cable to human indu&s;try. More than a
<PB N="226" REF="236">
league of the hard rock has been blown up with gunpowder, and a way formed which &s;eems dangerous to tho&s;e who are unu&s;ed to mountainous countries, or who&s;e heads are apt to turn giddy. It is about nine feet broad, and quite hangs over the precipice: in &s;ome parts, for, a con&s;iderable &s;pace, it is a hollow way, open only at one &s;ide, the rock above projecting over it, of the &s;ame breadth, and in the &s;ame direction. The appearance is peculiarly &s;ingular: for as the road winds continually, the &s;cene al&s;o continually changes; &s;o that one moment we commanded an exten|&s;ive view, and the next were totally inclo&s;ed with barren rock. From the beginning of the &s;teep de&s;cent we all di&s;mounted, and the hor&s;es were left to them&s;elves: it was &s;omewhat curious to &s;ee them picking out their way, and frequently venturing to the very edge of the precipice to crop a &s;trag|gling blade of gra&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="237">
The de&s;cent from the top to the plain, is about two leagues; when you are arrived at the bottom, and look up, you cannot &s;ee the &s;malle&s;t traces of a road; &s;o that a &s;tranger would hardly believe it po&s;&s;ible that there really is one, until convinced by his own ex|perience.</P>
<P>This place is famous for its hot me|dicinal &s;prings; and accordingly is much frequented by invalids of various kinds during this &s;ea&s;on of the year: the pa|tients either bathe or drink the waters. As far as I can judge from the accounts which I have received concerning their warmth, their analy&s;is, the method of u&s;ing them, and their efficacy in curing the gout, rheumati&s;m, ob&s;tructions, cutaneous di&s;orders, &amp;c.; they &s;eem nearly to re&s;emble tho&s;e of Bath. There are &s;everal &s;prings, of different warmth and of different qualities: according to the mo&s;t accurate experiments, the Mer|cury in Reaumur's thermometer &s;tands
<PB N="228" REF="238">
at 42 degrees, when plunged into the warme&s;t &s;ource: and it is &s;ome|what remarkable, that a &s;tream of cold water i&s;&s;ues from the ground within a few yards of this la&s;t-mentioned &s;pring.</P>
<P>The accommodations for the company are very bad: each per&s;on having for his own u&s;e a &s;mall apartment not more than a few feet &s;quare; in which there is ju&s;t room for a bed, a table, and two chairs. The public dining-room is, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, upon rather a larger &s;cale, as is al&s;o a kind of a&s;&s;embly-room, where the company, who are very &s;ocia|ble, meet occa&s;ionally. Formerly the accommodations were tolerably good; but unfortunately, in 1719, a <HI>lavange</HI> fell with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity from one of the neighbouring glaciers upon the village, as to overwhelm the greate&s;t part of the hou&s;es and the baths, and to de&s;troy a con&s;iderable number of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The company here, con&s;i&s;ting of a large collection of per&s;ons from different
<PB N="229" REF="239">
quarters of Swi&s;&s;erland, are exceedingly affable and obliging: in&s;omuch that &s;everal of them have invited us to their re&s;pective hou&s;es at Berne, Neuchatel, &amp;c.; and this invitation was made with all that openne&s;s and unaffected frank|ne&s;s &s;o peculiarly characteri&s;tic of the Swi&s;s. Accordingly we propo&s;e profit|ing of their ho&s;pitable offers, fully per|&s;uaded, that by &s;o doing, we &s;hall give them an unfeigned plea&s;ure: and in|deed it is not difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h an unmeaning invitation of mere formal civility, from one which is tendered with a real de&s;ire of being accepted. We dined this morning at eleven; the bell for &s;upper is now ringing, and it is &s;carce &s;even. The&s;e are primitive hours: but we have travelling appetites; and, provided we can but meet with refre&s;h|ment, it matters little at what hour, or in what place.</P>
<P>You are now probably drinking tea in your withdrawing-room, from whence
<PB N="230" REF="240">
you are enjoying that beautiful pro&s;pect I have &s;o often admired. The &s;ituation of this &s;pot is far more romantic than that of Bath, and the waters perhaps are full as efficacious: yet this village contains only a few mi&s;erable hou&s;es, while Bath is one of the fine&s;t towns in Europe. I had a conver&s;ation to-day upon this topic, among others, with a very ingenious and well-informed gen|tleman of this country. I ob&s;erved to him, that, con&s;idering the great credit and efficacy of the&s;e waters, I could not forbear wondering that the chiefs of the republic had not thought the im|provement of the accommodations an object worthy of their attention; as the rendering them more convenient for the reception of invalids, would undoubtedly be the means of drawing hither a great number of &s;trangers; and con&s;equently could not fail of being highly beneficial to the country. He a&s;&s;ured me, it had more than once been in their contem|plation:
<PB N="231" REF="241">
but that there were &s;ome per|&s;ons of great credit and authority, who oppo&s;ed it, upon a principle &s;imilar to the policy of Lycurgus; as they thought that a concour&s;e of &s;trangers would only &s;erve to introduce luxury among the inhabitants, and in&s;en&s;ibly de&s;troy that &s;implicity of manners, for which the <HI>Vallai&s;ans</HI> are &s;o remarkably di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.</P>
<P>How far the ignorance of a people contributes to their true felicity? or how far a &s;implicity of manners may be corrupted by <HI>national</HI> improvement? are que&s;tions, which have been much agi|tated; and will never be decided, &s;o long as it &s;hall be held ju&s;t rea&s;oning to argue from the abu&s;e to the u&s;e. But I &s;hould think, it will readily be al|lowed, that &s;uper&s;tition is ever the com|panion of ignorance; and that a peo|ple who are both ignorant and &s;uper|&s;titious, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be benefited by an intercour&s;e with nations more
<PB N="232" REF="242">
improved and enlightened than them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Not far from hence, a communica|tion has been made between this place and the village of Alpen, down a &s;teep rock. Where the mountain inclines ever &s;o little towards a &s;lope, a foot|path has been cut; but in tho&s;e parts where the rock is directly perpendicular, ladders are placed, not unlike tho&s;e by which one goes down into mines; and upon the&s;e the pea&s;ants a&s;cend and de|&s;cend with heavy burdens upon their &s;houlders. I mention &s;uch circum|&s;tances as the&s;e, not as being objects in them&s;elves &s;o remarkable, perhaps, as they are repre&s;ented by &s;ome travellers; but as they will give you a &s;tronger idea of the extreme ruggedne&s;s and &s;ingula|rity of the country.</P>

<P>IBEGIN now to feel my&s;elf much le&s;s con&s;trained in conver&s;ation than I have lately been; as the people in this part of the Vallais all talk a kind of French patois: for, this town being nearly the point, where the German patois terminates, and where the French begins; the inhabitants con&s;equently &s;peak both languages. Nothing is more curious or intere&s;ting to tho&s;e, who have entered into inquiries of this nature, than to ob&s;erve the gradations of lan|guage: but as I own my ignorance in this branch of literature, I can only mention the &s;imple fact.</P>
<P>We &s;et out this morning at five, and came down a very &s;teep valley to Leuk, a &s;mall town built upon an eminence near the Rhone: that river is here very
<PB N="234" REF="244">
rapid; and, if we may judge by the breadth of its channel, often overflows its banks. We cro&s;&s;ed it at this place, and continued for &s;ome way through a fore&s;t of firs, till we again pa&s;&s;ed the river to Sider: from thence along its banks to Sion, the capital of this <HI>dizain,</HI> and of the whole Vallais. This tract of country, called the Vallais, &s;tretches from ea&s;t to we&s;t about an hundred miles; and is divided into the upper and lower Vallais. The former reaches from the ea&s;tern extremity to the river Morge, below Sion; and the latter from that river to St. Gingol, &s;ituated upon the lake of Geneva: the whole containing about 100,000 &s;ouls, all Catholics.</P>
<P>The upper di&s;trict is &s;overeign of the lower, and is divided into &s;even inde|pendent dizains, or commonwealths; &s;ix <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The names of the&s;e &s;ix dizains are, Coms, Brieg, Raren, Vi&s;p, Leuk, and Sider.</NOTE> of which are democratical, and that of Sion ari&s;tocratical. The bi&s;hop of
<PB N="235" REF="245">
Sion was formerly ab&s;olute &s;overeign over the greate&s;t part of the Vallais: at pre&s;ent his authority is extremely li|mited, and he is little more than a kind of nominal prince. However, all the public acts are i&s;&s;ued out in his name; he has the power of pardoning crimi|nals; and the money is coined in his name, and with the arms of the re|public. He is &s;tyled prince of the Ger|man empire, and count or praefect of the Vallais.</P>
<P>The &s;even dizains or communities above|mentioned, form, conjointly with the bi|&s;hop, one republic; and all the general affairs are regulated in an a&s;&s;embly called Land&s;rath, or council of the country, which meets twice every year at Sion. This a&s;&s;em|bly con&s;i&s;ts of nine voices; namely, the bi&s;hop, who has but one vote, the lands-hauptmann, or chief of the republic, and each of the &s;even communities: and all their re&s;olutions are decided by the ma|jority. In this a&s;&s;embly the bi&s;hop pre|&s;ides,
<PB N="236" REF="246">
and the lands-hauptmann collects the votes. The latter is cho&s;en or con|firmed by this a&s;&s;embly every two years: and, upon the death of the bi&s;hop, the chapter of Sion choo&s;e four candidates from their own body, and out of the&s;e the a&s;&s;embly nominates. Each dizain, although it has but one vote, &s;ends to this diet as many deputies as it plea&s;es: they generally con&s;i&s;t of four;&mdash;a judge, a banneret, a captain, and a lieutenant. The judge and the lieutenant are ap|pointed every two years; the two others are for life. The democratical dizains are exceedingly jealous of their liberties, and very vigilant to prevent the deputies from gaining too great an influence. Accordingly, in each commonwealth, before the meeting of the diet, a ge|neral a&s;&s;embly of the people is &s;ummoned, in which every one of the age of four|teen has a vote: and in&s;tructions con|cerning all affairs of importance are by them given to their &s;everal deputies,
<PB N="237" REF="247">
which the latter are obliged &s;trictly to follow. By the&s;e means, the &s;everal votes in the general diet, do not depend upon the caprice or inclination of the deputies when a&s;&s;embled; but the mat|ter is fir&s;t laid before the particular a&s;|&s;emblies of each commonwealth, and according to their deci&s;ion the judge delivers in the vote.</P>
<P>In all cau&s;es of a certain importance, an appeal lies to this a&s;&s;embly in the la&s;t re&s;ort, from the inferior courts of ju&s;tice in the &s;everal dizains, as well as from tho&s;e of the bi&s;hop, and of the lands-hauptmann. Thus, by the in&s;titution of this &s;upreme council, all the &s;everal communities in this country are firmly united, and form in conjunction one body politic, or republic, for the gene|ral affairs of the nation at large. In other ca&s;es, each of the commonwealths is governed by its own particular laws and cu&s;toms: and the con&s;titution of the &s;ix popular ones re&s;embles in a great
<PB N="238" REF="248">
mea&s;ure the little democratical cantons of Swi&s;&s;erland.</P>
<P>Both the upper and lower Vallais were formerly dependent upon the bi&s;hop of Sion: but the inhabitants of the two di&s;tricts united together in order to limit his power; and, having &s;ucceeded in the attempt, they quarrelled among them|&s;elves for the &s;uperiority. A bloody war en&s;ued; which terminated, in 1475, by the total defeat of the lower Val|lai&s;ans. Since that period, they have continued &s;ubject to the others; enjoy|ing however &s;ome very con&s;iderable pri|vileges. The lower di&s;trict is divided into &s;ix departments, over which bailiffs are appointed by the general a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The republic of the Vallais is one of the allies of the thirteen cantons; and be&s;ides this general alliance, a particu|lar treaty &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between them and the &s;even Catholic cantons, for the defence of their common religion. They have entered likewi&s;e into treaties with France,

and other powers, with a re&s;erve how|ever in all of them re&s;pecting their ge|neral alliance with the thirteen cantons of Swi&s;&s;erland.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hops of Sion had formerly a con&s;iderable influence over the political affairs of Swi&s;&s;erland; and Matthew Schaner, the cardinal bi&s;hop, is famous in hi&s;tory for his great abilities, his dar|ing &s;pirit of intrigue, and his turbulent and re&s;tle&s;s ambition. It was entirely owing to his repre&s;entations and in|fluence, that the Swi&s;s troops gave the only in&s;tance, perhaps, of infidelity to their public engagements, of which they were ever guilty; by breaking a treaty they had ju&s;t concluded with Francis I. When that monarch marched into Italy to attack the Milane&s;e, he endeavoured to gain over the Swi&s;s; who having taken the duke of Milan under their protection, were the only ob&s;tacles to the progre&s;s of his arms. After much he&s;itation, they were at length pre|vailed
<PB N="240" REF="250">
upon, by the &s;ub&s;idies he offered, to enter into a treaty with him: but the alliance was no &s;ooner concluded, than the cardinal of Sion per&s;uaded them to break it, and continue the war. The Swi&s;s hi&s;torians however record, with triumph, the patriotic conduct of two of their officers upon this occa&s;ion; who, remon&s;trating again&s;t this breach of faith, drew off eight thou&s;and of their troops; and returning with them to their country, in &s;ome mea&s;ure re|trieved the honour of their nation.</P>
<P>The remainder of the army, in&s;tigated by the plau&s;ible and artful eloquence of the cardinal, attacked Francis I. near Marignano; which brought on one of the mo&s;t furious and ob&s;tinate battles that was fought during the bloody wars of Italy. Night alone put a &s;top to the en|gagement, without &s;eparating the com|batants; both armies remaining blended together upon the field of battle: Francis &s;lept upon the carriage of a
<PB N="241" REF="251">
cannon, at no great di&s;tance from a bat|talion of the enemy. At day-break the Swi&s;s renewed the charge with their u&s;ual courage, and were received with equal bravery. At length the intrepidity of the king, and the de&s;perate valour of the French, ro&s;e &s;uperior to the furious and repeated attacks of the Swi&s;s; and the latter retired in good order to Milan, leaving Francis in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field of battle: an advantage, however, which he gained by the lo&s;s of the brave&s;t of his troops.</P>
<P>The &s;ame cardinal of Sion, who al|ways entertained the mo&s;t inveterate en|mity to the French, occa&s;ioned al&s;o, by his &s;ole intrigues, the lo&s;s of the Mi|lane&s;e to Francis. Lautrec, in the year 1521, commanded a body of 12,000 Swi&s;s, who formed the principal &s;trength of his army. On the other &s;ide, the cardinal had obtained, by his influence over his countrymen, a &s;ecret levy of the
<PB N="242" REF="252">
like number, to join the army of the confederates: and thus, for the fir&s;t time, the Swi&s;s were &s;een combating un|der oppo&s;ite banners, and ready to com|mit ho&s;tilities again&s;t each other. Upon this occa&s;ion the cantons immediately di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers, with peremptory orders for the Swi&s;s in both armies, to return to their country. The cardinal bribed the me&s;&s;engers to conceal the&s;e orders from the Swi&s;s in the &s;ervice of the confederates; and to deliver them only to tho&s;e who were in the French army. The latter obeyed accordingly; and this de&s;ertion &s;o weakened the army of Lautrec, that he was no longer able to make head again&s;t the enemy: in con|&s;equence of which, Milan, and the prin|cipal towns, &s;urrendered to the confe|derates.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this part of the Vallais, are very much &s;ubject to <HI>goiters,</HI> or large excre&s;cences of fle&s;h that grow
<PB N="243" REF="253">
from the throat, and often encrea&s;e to a mo&s;t enormous &s;ize: but, what is more extraordinary, idiocy al&s;o remark|ably abounds among them. I &s;aw ma|ny in&s;tances of both kinds as I pa&s;&s;ed through this town: of the latter, &s;ome few were ba&s;king in the &s;un with their tongues out, and their heads hanging down; exhibiting the mo&s;t affecting &s;pectacle of intellectual imbecillity that can po&s;&s;ibly be conceived. The cau&s;es which produce a greater frequency of the&s;e phaenomena in this country than in any other, is a curious que&s;tion, which very much excites my inquiry: but I &s;hall defer &s;ending you my pre|&s;ent opinion, until I &s;hall have gained all the farther information in my power to procure.</P>
<P>The weather in this inclo&s;ed vale is exceedingly hot: I am at this in&s;tant, although it is late in the evening, &s;carce able to bear the intolerable &s;ultrine&s;s.
<PB N="244" REF="254">
This languid heat is probably one of the cau&s;es, which occa&s;ion the incon|ceivable lazine&s;s and indolence of the inhabitants: although &s;omething at the &s;ame time mu&s;t be attributed to the richne&s;s of the &s;oil, which is &s;o won|derfully fertile as almo&s;t to prevent la|bour, and &s;pontaneou&s;ly produce the fruits of the earth. And indeed the people a&s;&s;i&s;t nature very little: we pa&s;&s;|ed &s;everal vineyards, in which we ob|&s;erved the vines were &s;uffered to trail upon the ground; whereas, if at the expence of but little additional pains, the branches had been properly rai&s;ed and &s;upported, the owner would have been well rewarded by the &s;uperior quantity and quality of their produce.</P>
<P>The dirt and na&s;tine&s;s of the common people, is di&s;gu&s;ting beyond all expre&s;|&s;ion: of which I have had &s;ome unplea&s;ant proofs from entering into &s;everal hou&s;es, as well in the town it&s;elf as on my way
<PB N="245" REF="255">
to it. I have ju&s;t been holding a con|ver&s;ation upon this &s;ubject with my landlord; who, though much the na&s;|tie&s;t fellow I ever &s;aw, was complaining of the uncleanline&s;s of the people; and &s;eemed to a&s;&s;ign that circum&s;tance as one cau&s;e of the <HI>goiters.</HI> This induced me to ca&s;t my eyes upon the per&s;on of my ho&s;t with &s;omewhat more attention, in order to di&s;cover how it &s;tood with him&s;elf in that re&s;pect; and I was ra|ther di&s;appointed to find that he proved an exception to his own remark. Let me not, however, be under&s;tood as in|&s;inuating that all the inhabitants in ge|neral are either goitrous, idiots, indo|lent, or dirty; like that traveller who a&s;&s;erted, that all the women of a certain town were crooked, red-haired, and pitted with the &s;mall-pox, becau&s;e his landlady happened to be &s;o. Indeed, I look upon national reflections in gene|ral, to proceed from the narrowe&s;t and mo&s;t illiberal turn of mind: and I have
<PB N="246" REF="256">
always been cautious not to judge of the phy&s;ical, or moral character of any people from a partial and &s;uperficial view. But as to the &s;ingular preva|lency among the&s;e people of the two natural defects I have mentioned; it is a fact which I can venture to affirm, both from my own experience, and from various conver&s;ations I have had with &s;everal men of learning and ob|&s;ervation of this country: and with re|&s;pect to the general dirtine&s;s and indo|lence of the common people; it is too notorious to e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of the mo&s;t carele&s;s traveller.</P>

<P>AT Sion we parted with our hor&s;es and guides, who had accompa|nied us from Altdorf; and procured a piece of luxury, to which we had been for &s;ome time unaccu&s;tomed; I mean a coach. But, notwith&s;tanding the con|centrated
<PB N="248" REF="258">
heat of the climate, and the great &s;ultrine&s;s of the air, I prefer rid|ing or walking; as by that means one enjoys a more unob&s;tructed view of the country: and indeed the &s;cenes are &s;o beautiful, and &s;o perpetually changing, that one's attention is called upon every moment by a variety of new objects that &s;trongly demand admiration.</P>
<P>Upon entering the lower Vallais, I thought I perceived a greater appearance of indu&s;try than in the environs of Sion: and I am informed, that the&s;e people are not altogether &s;o indolent as the latter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This imputation of indolence will not hold good with re&s;pect to all the inhabitants of the upper Vallais: for in the ea&s;tern part of that di&s;trict, which we entered after having cro&s;&s;ed the Furca, the &s;oil, though far inferior in richne&s;s and fertility, was much better cultivated; and the people &s;eemed more indu&s;trious than any we have yet &s;een in this country. Some phy&s;ical rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned for this difference: for there the weather is not &s;o &s;ultry, the water is not unwhole|&s;ome, and the air is remarkably &s;alutary. Accord|ingly, upon our fir&s;t entering the Vallais, we did not ob&s;erve any of tho&s;e goitrous per&s;ons or idiots, which &s;truck us &s;o much in the midland parts.</NOTE>. But as to dirt, they by no means yield to tho&s;e of Sion.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="259" MS="y">
We &s;topped at the village of Marti|nac, which, according to antiquarians, was the ancient <HI>Octodurum.</HI> It is &s;aid, that near this place may be traced the &s;ite of Sergius Galba's camp, one of Julius Cae&s;ar's lieutenants; who was &s;ent by that general to &s;ubdue the Ve|ragri, the Pantuates, and the Seduni; the antient inhabitants of the&s;e di&s;tricts. It &s;eems evident indeed from Cae&s;ar's de&s;cription, in the third book of his commentaries, that <HI>Octodurum</HI> could not be far from the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of Martinac; placed as it is in a &s;mall plain, encircled by high mountains, and divided by the &s;mall river Dran&s;e, which falls not far from thence into the Rhone.
<PB N="250" REF="260">
I cannot however a&s;certain from my own ob&s;ervation, whether there are in fact any traces &s;till remaining of a Roman encampment; nor could I get any information concerning it from the inhabitants: &s;o that what I have men|tioned is only upon the faith of anti|quarians, and from the general po&s;ition of the country.</P>
<P>Near Martinac we were much plea&s;|ed with the maje&s;tic appearance of the ruins of an old ca&s;tle, built upon the &s;ummit of a craggy rock, and hanging over the torrent beneath: it was for|merly a ca&s;tle belonging to the bi&s;hop of Sion, and his principal re&s;idence. The road lies, from thence to St. Mau|rice, under a chain of rocks, with the Rhone flowing at a &s;mall di&s;tance through the mid&s;t of a rich vale. In our way we pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e to the <HI>Pi&s;&s;e-Vache;</HI> a waterfall, that de&s;cends from the glacier above, but which &s;eems to bur&s;t from the middle of the rock: I have
<PB N="251" REF="261">
&s;een higher falls, but none more beau|tiful. There is a cleft in the rock at top; on each &s;ide of this opening are &s;hrubs; and from the mid&s;t of the&s;e &s;hrubs, the torrent, ru&s;hing in a va&s;t body of water with amazing violence, falls perpendicularly into the valley. The&s;e torrents are my great delight: but perhaps they recur a little too often in my letters to continue to be yours.</P>
<P>Towards the extremity of the lower Vallais, the two chains of mountains that bound this country, approach to|wards the Rhone, which almo&s;t entirely fills up the &s;pace between them. In this &s;pot is &s;ituated the town of St. Maurice, built almo&s;t totally upon the rock, at the foot of a range of &s;teep moun|tains, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the river. Its antient appellation was <HI>Agaunum:</HI> it takes that of St. Maurice from an abbey, erected in the beginning of the &s;ixth century, by Sigi&s;mond king of Burgundy, in honour of a &s;aint &s;o called, who, it is pretended, &s;uffered
<PB N="252" REF="262">
martyrdom in this place. This &s;aint was the leader of the famous Theban legion, which con&s;i&s;ting of above &s;ix thou&s;and men, was ma&s;&s;acred (as it is &s;aid) by order of the emperor Maxi|mian, for not renouncing Chri&s;tianity. Various have been the di&s;putes con|cerning the authenticity of this hi&s;|tory: for while &s;ome authors have treated it as a mere forgery; others have contended for its being genu|ine, with as much warmth and zeal as if the truth of Chri&s;tianity de|pended upon the deci&s;ion. Without entering into the merits of the que&s;tion, I cannot but remark, that the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity has &s;uffered more from weak and imprudent defenders, than from the &s;harpe&s;t attacks of its mo&s;t inveterate ad|ver&s;aries. Indeed, the que&s;tion concern|ing the number and &s;ufferings of the mar|tyrs, has occa&s;ioned much idle contro|ver&s;y: for, reduce the popular accounts of both as low as probability can rea|&s;onably carry them, there will &s;till re|main
<PB N="253" REF="263">
&s;ufficient evidence of the wonder|ful con&s;tancy and calm re&s;olution of tho&s;e primitive victims: and whether an hundred thou&s;and, or only fifty, &s;uffered for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, it will equally &s;tand upon the &s;ame firm and immoveable foundation. Nor is the inquiry more material concerning the motives that actuated their powerful and cruel adver&s;aries. It matters not whether Decius ordered the Chri&s;tians to be per&s;ecuted, becau&s;e they had been favoured by his predece&s;&s;or Phi|lip, or from his attachment to the Pagan rites; whether Maximin per|&s;ecuted them from political motives; Diocle&s;ian as introducing innovations in his government; or whether they were favoured by Con&s;tantine from con|viction or from policy. For the truth of Chri&s;tianity is in no re&s;pect affected either by the imprudence of its early profe&s;&s;ors (if with any they were ju&s;tly chargeable) or the political rea&s;ons that influenced the conduct of tho&s;e empe|rors

<P>A few Roman in&s;criptions, and tho&s;e chiefly &s;epulchral, as al&s;o two antient columns, defaced and plai&s;tered, to|gether with the bridge over the Rhone, which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts entire, are the only vi&s;ible marks remaining of the anti|quity of this town. This is the chief entrance into the Vallais; and &s;o won|derfully is this country fortified by na|ture, that a handful of men might defend it again&s;t a very con&s;iderable army.</P>
<P>To-day we made an excur&s;ion into the canton of Berne, in order to &s;ee the &s;alt-works near Bex. We cro&s;&s;ed the Rhone over the antient and beau|tiful &s;tone-bridge, I have ju&s;t mention|ed, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;ingle arch, and e&s;|teemed by the mo&s;t judicious and be&s;t|informed
<PB N="255" REF="265">
antiquarians to be undoubt|edly Roman. Half of this bridge belongs to the Vallais, and the remainder to the canton of Berne. From hence com|mences the bailliage of Aigle, which reaches to the Pays de Vaud, and was formerly, when under the dominion of the hou&s;e of Savoy, compri&s;ed within that di&s;trict: at pre&s;ent it is cla&s;&s;ed under the German divi&s;ion of the canton, although the inhabitants talk French.</P>
<P>Upon our arrival at the &s;alt-&s;prings, I put on a workman's jacket, and went into the mountain about 3,000 feet, almo&s;t horizontally. The gallery is about eight feet high, and &s;ix broad, and is as nicely hollowed as if it had been cut with a chi&s;&s;el: it is by far the mo&s;t commodious &s;ubterranean pa&s;|&s;age I ever entered. The &s;alt is pro|cured from &s;ome &s;prings, which are found within a &s;olid rock, perforated at a great expence: the riche&s;t &s;ource
<PB N="256" REF="266">
yields twelve pound of &s;alt in an hun|dred weight of water, and the poore&s;t but one pound in the &s;ame quantity. Near the&s;e are &s;everal warm &s;prings, &s;trongly impregnated with &s;ulphur; &s;ome of which contain al&s;o a mixture of &s;alt; and will flame if a lighted candle be put into the pipe through which they flow. Not far from the riche&s;t of the &s;alt-&s;prings, &s;ome pieces of rock-&s;alt, in cubical forms, have been found; but the quantity hitherto di&s;covered is &s;o very incon&s;iderable, that no advantage ari&s;es from it.</P>
<P>The water is conveyed by pipes to Bevieux, where the &s;alt is extracted. If the whole quantity of the impreg|nated water which contains &s;o &s;mall a proportion of &s;alt, were to be boiled immediately, and at once; the con&s;ump|tion of wood requi&s;ite for that pur|po&s;e, would amount to a great ex|pence. In order to &s;ave this co&s;t, they make u&s;e of what is called a <HI>graduation|hou&s;e,</HI>
<PB N="257" REF="267">
con&s;tructed in the following man|ner:&mdash;It is a long building, open at the &s;ides; <HI>within</HI> are ranged layers of fag|gots, piled up to a con&s;iderable heighth. The water in que&s;tion is conveyed by pumps into re&s;ervoirs above, from whence it falls down upon the faggots, after having been re&s;olved into rain by the current of air: in filtering through the&s;e faggots, it depo&s;es a certain por|tion of its earthy and &s;elenitical par|ticles, and is received at bottom into other re&s;ervoirs; from whence it is pumped up again. This proce&s;s is re|peated as often as is found nece&s;&s;ary: after which it is then boiled, and the &s;alt chry&s;tali&s;es upon the &s;ides and at the bottom of the cauldron.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;alt-works, and tho&s;e of Aigle, are the only ones in Swi&s;&s;erland: and they are of great con&s;equence to this country; as it mu&s;t otherwi&s;e depend en|tirely upon foreign nations for a &s;upply of &s;o e&s;&s;ential an article. The&s;e works

The remainder is procured chief|ly from France, which is obliged by treaty to provide the Swi&s;s &s;tates with this commodity at a moderate price: and indeed &s;o high is the tax upon &s;alt in that kingdom, that even the French &s;alt is &s;old two thirds cheaper in Swi&s;&s;erland, than in many parts of France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Paris, where it is the deare&s;t, a pound of &s;alt is &s;old for about 13 &s;ols, or about &s;ix-pence of our money: in &s;ome other parts of France, for in&s;tance in Franche Comt&egrave;, a pound co&s;ts only 4 or 5 &s;ols; but it is furni&s;hed to the Swi&s;s at the rate of 2&frac12; &s;ols.</NOTE>.

<P>I AM now writing to you from the little village of Trient in the Val|lais, on my way to the glaciers of Savoy. From the mountain of the Furca, its ea&s;tern boundary, two va&s;t ranges of alps enclo&s;e the Vallais: the &s;outhern chain &s;eparates it from the Milane&s;e, Piedmont, and part of Savoy; the northern divides it from the canton of Berne. The&s;e two chains, in their various windings, form &s;everal &s;mall valleys, through which a number of torrents ru&s;h into the Rhone, as it traver&s;es the whole country from the
<PB N="260" REF="270">
Furca to St. Maurice. A country thus entirely enclo&s;ed within high alps, and con&s;i&s;ting of plains, elevated valleys, and lofty mountains, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily exhi|bit a great variety of &s;ituations, climates, and productions. Accordingly, the Val|lais pre&s;ents to the curious traveller a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pro&s;pects, as beau|tiful as they are diver&s;ified. Number|le&s;s vineyards, rich pa&s;ture-grounds co|vered with cattle, corn, flax, fruit|trees, and wild fore&s;ts: and the&s;e occa|&s;ionally bordered by naked rocks, who&s;e &s;ummits are crowned with everla&s;ting &s;now, and inacce&s;&s;ible glaciers. This &s;trong and &s;triking contra&s;t between the pa&s;toral and the &s;ublime; the cul|tivated and the wild; cannot but affect the mind of an ob&s;erver with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing emotions.</P>
<P>As to the productions of the Vallais; they mu&s;t evidently vary in different parts, according to the great diver&s;ity of climates, by which this country is &s;o
<PB N="261" REF="271">
peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed. It &s;upplies more than &s;ufficient wine and corn for the interior con&s;umption; and indeed a con&s;iderable quantity of both are yearly exported; the &s;oil in the midland and lower parts being exceedingly rich and fertile. In the plain, where the heat is collected and confined between the mountains, the harve&s;t is &s;o very for|ward, that it has already for &s;ome time been carried in: whereas, in the more elevated parts, barley is the only grain that can be cultivated with any &s;ucce&s;s; and the crop is &s;eldom cut before No|vember. About Sion, the fig, the me|lon, and all the other fruits of Italy, ripen to perfection: in con&s;equence of this &s;ingular variety of climates, I ta&s;ted in the &s;ame day (what is u&s;ually to be had only in gradual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion) &s;trawberries, cherries, plumbs, pears, and grapes; each of them the <HI>natural</HI> growth of the country.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to manufactures; there
<PB N="262" REF="272">
are none of any con&s;equence: and in|deed the general ignorance of the peo|ple is no le&s;s remarkable than their in|dolence; &s;o that they may be con&s;idered, in regard to knowledge and improve|ments, as &s;ome centuries behind the Swi&s;s, who are certainly a very enlight|ened nation. The pea&s;ants &s;eldom en|deavour to meliorate tho&s;e lands where the &s;oil is originally bad; nor to make the mo&s;t of tho&s;e, which are uncommonly fertile: having few wants, and being &s;atisfied with the &s;pontaneous gifts of nature, they enjoy her ble&s;&s;ings without much con&s;idering in what manner to improve them.</P>
<P>The beauties and varieties of this country you will find amply and faith|fully delineated in that elegant letter of the <HI>Nouvelle Heloi&s;e,</HI> where St. Preux relates his excur&s;ion into the upper Val|lais. As to the truth of the de&s;cription he gives, in the &s;ame letter, of the man|ners of the people; I can hardly be
<PB N="263" REF="273">
&s;uppo&s;ed to be a competent judge, from the little time I have pa&s;&s;ed among them. But, as far as I have had an opportunity to ob&s;erve and inquire; the picture, although in &s;ome parts not en|tirely devoid of re&s;emblance, is, upon the whole, con&s;iderably heightened.</P>
<P>Before I take leave of the Vallais, you will probably expect, that, according to my promi&s;e, I &s;hould &s;end you &s;ome informations concerning the cau&s;es which are &s;uppo&s;ed to occa&s;ion, or to contri|bute to render, goitrous per&s;ons and idiots, &s;o remarkably common in many parts of this country. I have indeed made all po&s;&s;ible re&s;earches in order to gain &s;ome &s;atisfactory intelligence upon &s;o curious a &s;ubject; but I have the mortification to add, that the very faint lights I have been able to obtain, have left me almo&s;t as much in the dark as I was before: you mu&s;t re&s;t contented therefore with mere conjectures.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin however with undoubted fact. The Vallai&s;ans are not all equally

The peo|ple in general are a robu&s;t and hardy race, as well tho&s;e who dwell in the places la&s;t-mentioned, as tho&s;e who in|habit the more mountainous parts of this country.</P>
<P>It is a common notion, that &s;now|water occa&s;ions goiters: but I have &s;ome rea&s;on to think the contrary. For, I have been at &s;everal places, where the inhabitants drink no other water than what they procure from tho&s;e rivers and torrents, which de&s;cend from the gla|ciers; and yet are not &s;ubject to this malady: indeed I have been a&s;&s;ured, though I will not venture to an&s;wer for the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion, that &s;now|water, &s;o far from being a cau&s;e, is e&s;teemed even a preventive. The air of the mountains is al&s;o a &s;trong pre|&s;ervative again&s;t them; and goiters have been known to dimini&s;h upon elevated

&s;ituations; whereas, in the lower parts of the Vallais, if this excre&s;cence once begins to &s;hew it&s;elf, it always continues to encrea&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This difference, however, may be occa&s;ioned by the different quality of the water, as well as by the &s;uperior purity of the air.</NOTE>. Some di&s;tricts are more particularly remarkable for this di&s;order than others: thus, in a little village, near Sion, almo&s;t all the inhabitants are goitrous.</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts it &s;eems rea&s;onable to conclude, that goiters are derived from certain local circum&s;tances; and that &s;everal cau&s;es, both phy&s;ical and moral, may jointly contribute to their production. Among the phy&s;ical; bad water, and bad air, may, perhaps, be ju&s;tly a&s;&s;igned, but chiefly the former; which, near the particular di&s;tricts above|mentioned, is &s;tagnant, and loaded with particles of <HI>tufo.</HI> The torrents al&s;o, which are formed by the melting of the &s;nows, di&s;&s;olve this &s;ub&s;tance, or &s;imilar ones, in their pa&s;&s;age: and probably
<PB N="266" REF="276">
this circum&s;tance has given ri&s;e to the notion, that &s;now-water, &s;imply in it|&s;elf, occa&s;ions the&s;e goiters; but where|ever it has that effect, it is &s;trongly im|pregnated with certain &s;tony particles. I was &s;hewn &s;everal pools of the&s;e &s;tag|nant waters, which I &s;hould have &s;up|po&s;ed no human being to have been capable of drinking. Among the moral cau&s;es, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to con|cur in occa&s;ioning the&s;e guttural protu|berances; the inconceivable lazine&s;s and negligence of the&s;e people, may be men|tioned. For, they rarely take the lea&s;t precaution to guard again&s;t, or to re|medy, the ill effects of their unwhole|&s;ome water: indolently acquie&s;cing in its con&s;equences, they u&s;e no &s;ort of means either to prevent or remove them.</P>
<P>The &s;ame cau&s;es, which &s;eem to pro|duce the goiters, probably operate in the ca&s;e of idiots: for, wherever in this country the former abound, the latter are al&s;o in great numbers. Such in|deed
<PB N="267" REF="277">
is the nice and inexplicable con|nection between our bodies and our minds, that the one ever &s;ympathi&s;es with the other: we &s;ee that the body &s;uffers, whenever the mind is deeply af|fected by any &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of me|lancholy and di&s;tre&s;s; and, in return, that whenever the corporeal frame is im|paired and &s;hattered by long pain and &s;ickne&s;s, the under&s;tanding al&s;o is equally out of order. Hence it is by no means an ill-grounded conjecture, that in the ca&s;e before us, the &s;ame cau&s;es which affect the body &s;hould al&s;o affect the mind; or, in other words, that the &s;ame waters, &amp;c. which create ob&s;truc|tions, and goiters, &s;hould al&s;o occa&s;ion mental imbecillity and di&s;arrangement. But, in conjunction with cau&s;es of a phy&s;ical nature, there is a moral one likewi&s;e to be taken into the account: for the children of the common people are totally neglected by their parents; and, with no more education than the
<PB N="268" REF="278">
meane&s;t brutes, are, like tho&s;e, &s;uffered to wallow in the dirt, and to eat and drink whatever comes in their way.</P>
<P>I &s;aw &s;everal idiots with goiters; but I do not mean to draw any certain con|clu&s;ion from that circum&s;tance. For, though in general they are the children of goitrous parents, and have frequently tho&s;e &s;wellings them&s;elves; yet the con|trary often happens: and they are &s;ome|times the offspring even of healthy pa|rents, who&s;e other children are all properly organized. So that, it &s;eems, the cau&s;es above-mentioned operate more or le&s;s upon &s;ome con&s;titutions than upon others; as indeed is ob&s;ervable in all epidemical di&s;orders what&s;oever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I was told by a phy&s;ician of the Vallais, that children are &s;ometimes <HI>born</HI> with goiters; and I &s;aw &s;everal, &s;carce ten years old, who had very large ones. The&s;e &s;wellings, when they encrea&s;e to a con&s;iderable magnitude, check re&s;piration, and render tho&s;e who have them exceedingly lan|guid and indolent. During my expedition through the Vallais, I ob&s;erved &s;ome of all proportions, from the &s;ize of a walnut to the bigne&s;s of a peck loaf.</P>

&s;ome gentlemen of this country, whom I met at the baths of Leuk, they treated the notion as ab&s;urd and fal&s;e: but whether they &s;poke their real &s;en|timents, or were unwilling to confirm what they thought might lower their countrymen in the opinion of a &s;tranger, will admit perhaps of &s;ome doubt.

<P>UPON quitting Trient, we went along &s;ome narrow vallies through fore&s;ts of pines by the &s;ide of the torrent of Trient; and &s;oon afterwards entered
<PB N="274" REF="284">
the valley of Or&s;ina, which led us to the &s;mall village of that name: a little way
<PB N="275" REF="285">
from Trient we entered the dutchy of Faucigny, which belongs to the king of Sardinia. Our road was very rugged, till we arrived at the vale of Chamouny; the great mountains and glaciers of Savoy ri&s;ing maje&s;tically before us.</P>
<P>There are five glaciers, which extend almo&s;t to the plain of the vale of Cha|mouny, and are &s;eparated by wild fore&s;ts, corn-fields, and rich meadows: &s;o that immen&s;e tracts of ice are blended with the highe&s;t cultivation, and perpetually &s;ucceed to each other in the mo&s;t &s;ingu|lar and &s;triking vici&s;&s;itude. All the&s;e &s;everal vallies of ice, which lie chiefly in the hollows of the mountains, and are &s;ome leagues in length, unite together at the foot of Mont Blanc; the highe&s;t mountain in Europe, and probably of the antient world.</P>
<P>According to the calculations of Mr. De Luc, (by who&s;e improvement of the barometer, elevations are taken with a degree of accuracy before unattainable,)
<PB N="276" REF="286">
the heighth of this mountain above the level of the &s;ea is 2391&frac13; French toi&s;es. Mr. de Sau&s;&s;ure, profe&s;&s;or of natural philo&s;ophy at Geneva, has made u&s;e of the above barometer in mea&s;uring the elevation of &s;everal very con&s;iderable mountains. This great improvement of the barometer marks a di&s;tingui&s;hed aera in the hi&s;tory of natural philo&s;o|phy; as, before it was rectified by that ingenious naturali&s;t, Mr. de Luc, its uncertainty was &s;o great, that there was no relying upon the men&s;urations, which had been taken by that in&s;tru|ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It was by this means that Mr. de Luc found the altitude of the glacier of <HI>Buet;</HI> and from thence he took geometrically the elevation of <HI>Mont Blanc</HI> above the Buet. The labours of this celebrated naturali&s;t, and his rules for computing heighths by the barometer, are to be found in his very valuable treati&s;e "<HI>Sur les Modifications de l' Atmo&s;ph&egrave;re.</HI>" The&s;e rules are explained, and his tables reduced to Engli&s;h mea&s;ure, by Dr. Ma&s;kelyne, R. A.; and &s;till more fully by Dr. Hor&s;ley, &s;ecretary to the Royal Society: both the&s;e treati&s;es are publi&s;hed in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions for the year 1774.</P>
<P>The accuracy of the barometrical mea&s;urements made by Mr. de Luc, was verified by Sir George Schuckborough, in a number of ingenious experi|ments towards a&s;certaining the elevation of &s;ome of the mountains of Savoy, a &s;hort time before I ar|rived at Geneva. He followed Mr. de Luc's me|thod; took the heighths of &s;everal mountains, reci|procally, by barometrical and geometrical ob&s;erva|tions; and he perceived that the former coincided almo&s;t exactly with the latter.</P>
<P>Having found the elevation of the &s;ummit of the <HI>Mole,</HI> a neighbouring mountain, above the &s;urface of the lake of Geneva; he took from thence the geometrical altitude of <HI>Mont Blanc.</HI></P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of the&s;e experiments, he was enabled to correct &s;ome trifling errors that had crept into Mr. de Luc's computations; to improve &s;till farther the di&s;coveries of the latter; and has facilitated the means of taking elevations, by &s;im|plifying the tables and rules nece&s;&s;ary for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The heighth of <HI>Mont Blanc,</HI> according to Sir George Schuckborough, is 15,662 feet perpendi|cular above the level of the &s;ea; according to Mr. de Luc 2391&frac13; French toi&s;es: which, reduced to our mea&s;ure, gives 15,303 feet; if the proportion of the French to the Engli&s;h foot be nearly as 15 to 16, without con&s;idering the fraction.

After above fourteen hours mo&s;t violent fatigue, employed in mount|ing rugged and dangerous a&s;cents, in cro&s;&s;ing &s;everal vallies of ice, and large plains of &s;now, which was in &s;ome parts
<PB N="284" REF="294">
&s;o loo&s;e, that they &s;unk in it down to the wai&s;t; they found them&s;elves upon the &s;ummit next to Mont Blanc. At fir&s;t &s;ight it appeared &s;carce a league di&s;tant: however, they &s;oon di&s;covered that the clearne&s;s of the air, the extra|ordinary whitene&s;s of the &s;now, and the heighth of that mountain, made it &s;eem nearer than it was in reality; and, they perceived with regret, that it would require at lea&s;t four hours more to ar|rive at it, even &s;uppo&s;ing it were prac|ticable. But as the day was now far advanced, and the vapours towards the &s;ummit of Mont Blanc began to gather into clouds; they were obliged to return without having accompli&s;hed their en|terpri&s;e. They had no time to lo&s;e: and as they were returning in great ha&s;te, one of the party &s;lipped down in attempting to leap over a cha&s;m of ice. He had in his hand a long pole, &s;piked with iron, which he had &s;truck into the ice on the other &s;ide of the
<PB N="285" REF="295">
opening; and upon this he hung dreadfully &s;u&s;pended for a few moments, until he was taken out by his com|panions. The danger he had ju&s;t e&s;caped, made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon him, that he fainted away, and continued for &s;ome time in that &s;ituation: he was at length, however, brought to him&s;elf, and, though con&s;iderably brui&s;ed, he &s;ufficiently recovered to be able to go on. They did not arrive at Chamouny till eight that evening, after having pa&s;&s;ed two and twenty hours of inconceivable fatigue, and being more than once in danger of lo&s;ing their lives in tho&s;e de|&s;olate regions; but, as &s;ome &s;ort of recompence for &s;o much danger and fatigue, they have the &s;atisfaction, at lea&s;t, to boa&s;t of having approached nearer to Mont Blanc than any former adventurers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>According to Sir George Schuckborough, the &s;ummit to which they arrived, is more than 13,000 feet above the Mediterranean. The&s;e per&s;ons how|ever do not &s;eem to have taken &s;ufficient precau|tions for &s;o perilous an enterprize: for the expe|dition was not only hazardous to a great degree, but it was al&s;o too fatiguing and too difficult to be accompli&s;hed within twenty-four hours. They ought to have &s;et out in the morning, have taken furs with them, and, if po&s;&s;ible, have found &s;ome proper place in which to have pa&s;&s;ed the night. If that could have been accompli&s;hed, and if by any means they could have guarded them&s;elves again&s;t the piercing cold, they would have been &s;ufficiently refre&s;hed the next morning to have pur&s;ued their expedition; and would not have found them&s;elves, after having advanced within four hours of Mont Blanc, &s;o fatigued and ter|rified as to be unable to proceed; nor the day &s;o far advanced, that, had they gone on, they mu&s;t have been overtaken by darkne&s;s, and would pro|bably have either fallen down one of the precipices, or have peri&s;hed with cold.</P>

<P>AUGUST 23d, (the day of our arrival at Chamouny) we mounted by the &s;ide of the glacier of Bo&s;&s;on, in order to &s;ee <HI>les Murailles de glace,</HI> &s;o called from their re&s;emblance to walls: they con&s;i&s;t of large ranges of ice of prodigious thickne&s;s and &s;olidity, ri&s;ing abruptly from their ba&s;e, and parallel to each other. Some of the&s;e ranges ap|peared to us about an hundred and fifty feet high; but if we may believe our
<PB N="287" REF="297">
guides, they are four hundred feet above their real ba&s;e. Near them were py|ramids and cones of ice of all forms and &s;izes, and &s;hooting up to a very con&s;iderable heighth, in the mo&s;t beauti|ful and fanta&s;tic &s;hapes imaginable. From this glacier, which we cro&s;&s;ed without much difficulty, we had a fine view of the vale of Chamouny.</P>
<P>The 24th. We had propo&s;ed &s;allying forth this morning very early, in order to go to the valley of ice, in the glacier of Montenvert, and to penetrate as far
<PB N="288" REF="298">
as the time would admit; but the wea|ther proving cloudy, and likely to rain, we deferred &s;etting out till nine, when appearances gave us the hope of its clearing up. Accordingly we procured three excellent guides, and a&s;cended on hor&s;eback &s;ome part of the way over the mountain which leads to the gla|cier above-mentioned: we were then obliged to di&s;mount, and &s;crambled up the re&s;t of the mountains (chiefly co|vered with pines) along a &s;teep and rugged path, called <Q REND="inline">"the road of the <HI>chry&s;tal-hunters.</HI>"</Q> From the &s;ummit of the Montenvert we de&s;cended a little to the edge of the glacier; and made a refre&s;hing meal upon &s;ome cold provi&s;ion which we brought with us. A large block of granite, called <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>La pierre des Anglois,</HI>"</Q> &s;erved us for a table; and near us was a mi&s;erable hovel, where tho&s;e, who make expeditions towards Mont Blanc, frequently pa&s;s the night. The &s;cene around us was magnificent
<PB N="289" REF="299">
and &s;ublime; numberle&s;s rocks ri&s;ing boldly above the clouds, (&s;ome of who&s;e tops were bare, others covered with &s;now.) Many of the&s;e gradually dimi|ni&s;hing towards their &s;ummits, end in &s;harp points: and from this circum&s;tance they are called the <HI>Needles</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The names of the principal ones are Aiguille de Dreux, Aiguille de Moine, Aiguille de Tacul, Aiguille de Charmeaux and tho&s;e of the five gla|ciers, that &s;tretch towards the plain of Chamouny, and unite at the foot of Mont Blanc, are Tacona, Boi&s;&s;on, Montenvert, Argentiere, and Tour.</NOTE>. Between the&s;e rocks the valley of ice &s;tretches &s;everal leagues in length, and is nearly a mile broad; extending on one &s;ide towards Mont Blanc, and, on the other, towards the plain of Chamouny.</P>
<P>After we had &s;ufficiently refre&s;hed our&s;elves, we prepared for our adven|ture acro&s;s the ice. We had each of us a long pole &s;piked with iron; and, in order to &s;ecure us as much as po&s;&s;ible from &s;lipping, the guides fa&s;tened to
<PB N="290" REF="300">
our &s;hoes <HI>crampons,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;mall bar of iron, to which are fixed four &s;mall &s;pikes of the &s;ame metal. The difficulty of cro&s;&s;ing the&s;e valleys of ice, ari&s;es from the immen&s;e cha&s;ms. They are produced by &s;everal cau&s;es; but more particularly by the continual melt|ing of the interior &s;urface: this fre|quently occa&s;ions a &s;inking of the ice; and under &s;uch circum&s;tances, the whole ma&s;s is &s;uddenly rent a&s;under in that particular place with a mo&s;t violent ex|plo&s;ion. We rolled down large &s;tones into &s;everal of them; and the great length of time before they reached the bottom, gave us &s;ome conception of their depth: our guides a&s;&s;ured us, that in &s;ome places they are five hundred feet deep. I can no otherwi&s;e convey to you an image of this immen&s;e body of ice, con&s;i&s;ting of continued irregu|lar ridges and deep cha&s;ms, than by re|&s;embling it to a raging &s;ea, that had been in&s;tantaneou&s;ly frozen in the mid&s;t of a violent &s;torm.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="301">
We began our walk with great &s;lowne&s;s and deliberation, but we gra|dually gained more courage and confi|dence as we advanced; and we &s;oon found that we could &s;afely pa&s;s along tho&s;e parts, where the a&s;cent and de&s;cent were not very con&s;iderable, much fa&s;ter even than when walking at the rate of our common pace: in other parts we leaped over the clefts, and &s;lid down the &s;teeper de&s;cents as well as we could. In one place, where we de&s;cended and &s;tepped acro&s;s an opening upon a nar|row ridge of ice &s;carce three inches broad; we were obliged to tread with peculiar caution: for, on each &s;ide were cha&s;ms of a great depth. We walked &s;ome paces &s;ideways along this ridge; &s;tept acro&s;s the cha&s;m into a little hol|low, which the guides made on purpo&s;e for our feet; and got up an a&s;cent by means of &s;mall holes which we made with the &s;pikes of our poles. All this &s;ounds terrible; but at the time we
<PB N="292" REF="302">
had none of us the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ions of danger, as the guides were ex|ceedingly careful, and took excellent precautions. One of our &s;ervants had the courage to follow us without <HI>cram|pons,</HI> and with no nails to his &s;hoes; which was certainly dangerous, on ac|count of the &s;lipperine&s;s of the leather when wetted. He got along however &s;urpri&s;ingly well; though in &s;ome places we were alarmed, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;lip upon the edge of one of tho&s;e cha&s;ms: for had that accident happened to any of us, we mu&s;t inevitably have been lo&s;t; having neglected to provide our&s;elves with long ropes in ca&s;e of &s;uch an event. This man was probably the fir&s;t per&s;on, who ever ventured acro&s;s the valley of ice, without either <HI>crampons</HI> or nails to his &s;hoes.</P>
<P>We were now almo&s;t arrived at the other extremity, when we were &s;topped by a cha&s;m &s;o broad, that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of pa&s;&s;ing it; and we were
<PB N="293" REF="303">
obliged to make a circuit of above a quarter of a mile, in order to get round this va&s;t opening. This will give you &s;ome idea of the difficulty attending ex|cur&s;ions over &s;ome of the&s;e glaciers: and our guides informed us, that when they hunt the <HI>chamois</HI> and the <HI>marmottes,</HI> in the&s;e de&s;olate regions; the&s;e unavoidable cir|cuits generally carry them &s;ix or &s;even miles about, when they would have only two miles to go if they could proceed in a &s;traight line. A &s;torm threatening us every moment, we were obliged to ha&s;ten off the glacier as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible: for, rain renders the ice exceedingly &s;lippery; and in ca&s;e of a fog (which generally accom|panies a &s;torm in the&s;e upper regions) our &s;ituation would have been extremely dangerous. And indeed we had no time to lo&s;e; for the tempe&s;t began ju&s;t as we had quitted the ice; and &s;oon became very violent, attended with frequent fla&s;hes of lightning, and loud peals of thunder, which being re-echoed within
<PB N="294" REF="304">
the hollows of the mountains, added great|ly to the awful &s;ublimity of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>We now de&s;cended a very &s;teep preci|pice, and for &s;ome way were obliged to crawl upon our hands and feet down a bare rock; the &s;torm at the &s;ame time roaring over us, and rendering the rock extremely &s;lippery: we were by this time quite wet through, but we got to the bottom however without much hurt. Upon ob&s;erving the immen&s;e extent of the&s;e glaciers, I could not help remark|ing (and it is a circum&s;tance which many other travellers have ob&s;erved be|fore) what a fund is here laid up for the &s;upply of rivers; and that the &s;ources which give ri&s;e to the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Po will never fail. I returned at length to the inn, as dripping wet as if I had been plunged into water; but perfectly &s;atisfied with my expedi|tion. At Grindelwald, and at Lauter|brunnen, I had &s;carcely &s;een a glacier, owing to the ignorance of the guides;
<PB N="295" REF="305">
and this induced me to &s;u&s;pect, that all which had been &s;aid of them was greatly exaggerated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 204, and 206.</NOTE>. But I now change my tone, and am vexed that we were &s;o pre&s;&s;ed for time, that we could not con|tinue any longer at Chamouny; for, I &s;hould have had great plea&s;ure in mak|ing different excur&s;ions towards Mont Blanc; and in penetrating further into tho&s;e de&s;olate but magnificent regions.</P>
<P>I cannot conceive any &s;ubject in na|tural hi&s;tory more curious than the for|mation and progre&s;s of the&s;e glaciers, running far into fields of corn and rich pa&s;ture; and lying, without being melted, in a &s;ituation where the &s;un has power &s;ufficient to ripen the fruits of the field: it is literally true, that with one hand we could touch ice, and with the other ripe corn. But, as this is a &s;ubject too important to be treated &s;uperficially, and requires much accu|rate
<PB N="296" REF="306">
ob&s;ervation, and repeated experi|mental inve&s;tigation; I &s;hall not at|tempt to enter into it. I will beg leave however to trouble you with one ob|&s;ervation, which I made: and it will &s;erve to prove the occa&s;ional encrea&s;e and diminution of the glaciers; contrary to the opinion of &s;ome philo&s;ophers, who advance that they remain always the &s;ame; and of others who a&s;&s;ert, that they are continually encrea&s;ing. I think I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that both the&s;e po&s;itions are equally untenable; and it happens in this, as in many other &s;ubjects, that experience and truth are &s;acrificed to the &s;upporting of a fa|vourite hypothe&s;is. Indeed the fact &s;eems to be, that the&s;e glaciers in &s;ome years encrea&s;e con&s;iderably in extent, while in others they recede; and of this I am perfectly convinced from the fol|lowing circum&s;tances:</P>
<P>The borders of the valley of ice of the glacier of Montenvert, are mo&s;tly
<PB N="297" REF="307">
&s;kirted with trees: towards its foot a va&s;t arch of ice ri&s;es to near an hundred feet in heighth; from under which, the continued droppings from the melting of the ice and &s;now are collected toge|ther, and form the Arveron; which ru&s;hes forth with con&s;iderable force, and in a large body of water. As we ap|proached the extremity of this arch, we pa&s;&s;ed through a wood of firs: tho&s;e which &s;tand at a little di&s;tance from the ice are about eighty feet high, and are undoubtedly of a very great age. Be|tween the&s;e and the glacier the trees are of a later growth; as is evident as well from their inferior &s;ize, as from their texture and &s;hape. Others, which re&s;emble the latter, have been overturned, and enveloped in the ice: in all the&s;e &s;everal trees, re&s;pective|ly &s;ituated in the &s;pots I have men|tioned, there &s;eems to be a kind of regular gradation in their age, from the large&s;t &s;ize to tho&s;e that lie pro&s;trate.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="308">
The&s;e facts fairly lead, it &s;hould &s;eem, to the following conclu&s;ions:&mdash;that the glacier once extended as far as the row of tall firs; that, upon its retiring, a number of trees have &s;hot up in the very &s;pots which it formerly occupied; that, within &s;ome years, the glacier has again begun to advance; and in its progre&s;s has overturned the trees of later date, before they have had time to grow up to any con&s;iderable heighth.</P>
<P>To the&s;e circum&s;tances, another fact may be added, which appears to me con|vincing. There are large &s;tones of gra|nite, which are found only at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the extremities of the gla|cier. The&s;e are va&s;t fragments, which have certainly fallen down from the mountains upon the ice; have been carried on by the glacier in its en|crea&s;e; and have tumbled into the plain upon the melting or &s;inking of the ice, which &s;upported them. The&s;e &s;tones, which the inhabitants call <HI>Mareme,</HI> form a kind of border, towards the foot of
<PB N="299" REF="309">
the valley of ice, and have been pu&s;hed forward by the glacier in its advances: they extend even to the place occupied by the larger pines.</P>
<P>As we proceeded from Chamouny, the heighth of the mountains gradually dimini&s;hed; and the &s;everal valleys through which we pa&s;&s;ed, were diver&s;i|fied in their figures and productions in a very agreeable manner. The&s;e &s;cenes, to travellers who come from the more cultivated and le&s;s romantic parts of Swi&s;&s;erland, mu&s;t appear infinitely a&s;to|ni&s;hing; but with re&s;pect to our&s;elves, who are lately arrived from the wilde&s;t country and the mo&s;t barren rocks, they made but little impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We followed the cour&s;e of the Arve, which takes its ri&s;e from the glacier of Argentiere; and ru&s;hes along in a &s;ono|rous torrent great part of the way. Not far from Salenche we came to a de&s;cent, where on our right-hand was a &s;mall lake formed by a &s;tream, that bur&s;ts
<PB N="300" REF="310">
from the rock; and from this lake i&s;&s;ues a current which falls into the Arve: the &s;ituation was picture&s;que, and the bor|ders of the little lake, &s;kirted with wood, were extremely plea&s;ing and variegated. From hence we de&s;cended into the plain, which continues almo&s;t perfectly level to Geneva. Salenche lies at the bottom of a broad valley, which here contracts to a narrow pa&s;s. Tradition &s;ays, that this little plain was once a lake; and indeed its form, and the quality of the &s;oil, &s;eem to ju&s;tify tradition: great part is laid wa&s;te by the unruly Arve, which frequently overflows its banks; and the re&s;t is mo&s;tly covered with fruit|trees.</P>
<P>Not far from Magland we &s;topped to admire a beautiful fall of water, called the ca&s;cade of Arpenas: it is a torrent, which ru&s;hes, like the Staubbach, from an impending rock. When I &s;aw it, there was a con&s;iderable wind, which drove the torrent, &s;oon after its leaving the rock, at
<PB N="301" REF="311">
lea&s;t an hundred yards out of the perpen|dicular direction, into an almo&s;t imper|ceptible &s;pray: I then beheld it trickling down the &s;ides of the mountains in a thou&s;and little &s;treams, which united at a ridge of the rock; and from thence formed three ca&s;cades, all different from each other. The body of water was much more con&s;iderable than that of the Staubbach, and the fall appeared to me altogether as high. Between Mag|land and Clu&s;e we took a guide to con|duct us to the cave of <HI>Baume;</HI> of which we had read a mo&s;t magnificent de&s;crip|tion. Though the a&s;cent was not very high, yet it was &s;o &s;teep that we were nearly an hour in reaching it: we then &s;crambled along an ugly precipice, from which we mounted a ladder; and by the aid of the branches of a nut-tree growing out of the rock at the mouth of the cave, we pulled our&s;elves into a natural cavern more than a quarter of a mile in length, and forming various
<PB N="302" REF="312">
branches that led into lofty vaults and &s;pacious openings. A man of a very warm imagination, might perhaps have di&s;covered a magnificent chapel with a natural cupola, an ar&s;enal, the ruins of a &s;umptuous palace, &amp;c.; but as for my part, I &s;aw only a &s;pacious cave, covered with &s;talactites, &s;pars, and petrifactions, which &s;hone beautifully enough, but which I have &s;een in al|mo&s;t all the natural caverns I ever en|tered: nor was this &s;o tran&s;cendently beautiful, as to an&s;wer the trouble it co&s;t us to get into it.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the night at Clu&s;e, which is &s;ituated in a rich plain by the &s;ide of the Arve; and the next morning came down the banks of that river to Bonneville, the capital of the dutchy of Faucigny: it &s;tands al&s;o upon the Arve, at the bottom of a chain of rocks, which from this place dimini&s;h into hills. All this part of Faucigny, as al&s;o a &s;mall &s;trip of the Chablais through
<PB N="303" REF="313">
which we pa&s;&s;ed, is a rich plain, that produces wine and corn in great plen|ty: but it is neither very populous nor perfectly well cultivated. By the little village of Chene we entered into the ter|ritory of Geneva: the &s;udden change from the poverty of the Savoyards to the neatne&s;s and ea&s;e of the&s;e people; the populou&s;ne&s;s of the country, the richne&s;s of its cultivation; and the number of country-hou&s;es &s;cattered a|bout the fields like ours in England, were circum&s;tances that affected me with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing admiration.</P>

<P>AS I propo&s;e vi&s;iting Geneva again, in my way to the &s;outh of France, I will defer &s;ending you any account of that intere&s;ting town until my return;
<PB N="304" REF="314">
when, as I intend pa&s;&s;ing a &s;hort time there, I hope to get &s;ome farther infor|mation concerning the government, &amp;c. which I will not fail of communicating to you.</P>
<P>We went from Geneva to Cra&s;&s;i, a &s;mall village in the Pays de Vaud, where we pa&s;&s;ed a day with one of our coun|trymen, who has taken a hou&s;e for the &s;ummer in that delightful &s;pot. In our way to Cra&s;&s;i we went through Ver&s;oi, a little village in the French territories, upon the lake of Geneva: it goes by the name of <HI>Choi&s;eul's folly.</HI> Geneva having fallen under the di&s;plea&s;ure of France; that mini&s;ter endeavouring to take advantage of the late troubles in 1768, laid a plan to ruin that town, and to monopoli&s;e the whole trade of the lake. Accordingly he fixed upon Ver&s;oi as a &s;ituation the mo&s;t proper upon which to build a large town. For this purpo&s;e he began by &s;inking a pier and making an harbour: he con&s;tructed al&s;o
<PB N="305" REF="315">
a frigate; marked out the &s;treets; &s;ent a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;tone to build the hou&s;es; ordered a garri&s;on, and erected huts for them, in which they continued &s;ome time. In &s;hort, the borders of the lake for &s;ome way are &s;trewed with all kinds of materials for building. Neverthele&s;s, when the har|bour was nearly fini&s;hed, and govern|ment had expended near three millions of livres; the whole &s;cheme was given up. But the harbour, the huts, and the materials for building &s;till remain, di&s;|graceful monuments of his ill-concerted project.</P>
<P>This <HI>Pays de Vaud</HI> is a country, of which all hi&s;torians and travellers, who have had occa&s;ion to mention it, &s;peak with rapture; particularly of that part which borders upon the lake of Geneva: and indeed a more delightful country can|not well be imagined. It is, almo&s;t the whole way, a gradual a&s;cent from the edge of the lake, richly laid out in vine|yards,
<PB N="306" REF="316">
corn-fields, and luxuriant mea|dows; and checkered with continued ham|lets, villages, and towns: the &s;hores are generally of the cleane&s;t gravel; and the water is of &s;o fine a tran&s;parency, that you may &s;ee the bottom to a very con|&s;iderable depth.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed through Nyon, which &s;tands upon the edge of the lake, and in the very point where it begins to widen. It was formerly called <HI>Colonia Eque&s;tris No|vidunum;</HI> and, as a proof of its antiquity, &s;everal Roman in&s;criptions, and other an|tient remains, have been frequently dug up in the out-&s;kirts of the town. Between St. Pres and Morges, the lake forms a beautiful bay: the&s;e towns are &s;ituated upon the two points which jut out into the water; the whole forming an amphitheatre gently ri&s;ing to the Jura.</P>
<P>All the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in this country which belonged to the duke of Savoy, were wre&s;ted from him in the war which the canton of Berne declared
<PB N="307" REF="317">
again&s;t him, in 1536, in defence of Geneva: and the &s;ame year the refor|mation was introduced. From that pe|riod all the Pays de Vaud (excepting the common bailliages of Grand&s;on, Orbe, and a &s;mall portion of it which was ceded to Fribourg) has been &s;ubject to Berne, and makes part of that canton.</P>
<P>Lau&s;anne is built upon an a&s;cent &s;o &s;teep, that in &s;ome places it is with great difficulty the hor&s;es can draw up a carri|age; and foot-pa&s;&s;engers mount towards the upper part of the town by flights of &s;teps, which lean again&s;t the rock. But the&s;e inconveniences are amply com|pen&s;ated by the &s;ublime&s;t views in na|ture: the principal object is the lake of Geneva, &s;haped like a bow; the <HI>arc</HI> of which is formed by the Pays de Vaud, and the <HI>cord</HI> by the coa&s;t of Chablais.

in its breadth; the narrowe&s;t part is &s;carce three miles acro&s;s, and from Rolles to Thonon about fifteen. It is not altogether &s;o large as that of Con&s;tance, but the &s;cenery is far more grand and picture&s;que.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year in which part of the Pays de Vaud was conquered from the hou&s;e of Savoy, the inhabitants of this town expelled the bi&s;hop, and put them|&s;elves under the protection and &s;overeign|ty of the canton of Berne; which con|firmed all their privileges, and added others. At pre&s;ent, Lau&s;anne is governed by its own magi&s;trates; has its own courts of ju&s;tice; and, what is very &s;ingular, the citizens who inhabit the principal &s;treet have the privilege of pronouncing &s;en|tence in criminal cau&s;es. The criminal is tried by the civil power; if he is found, and acknowledges him&s;elf, guilty (for his own confe&s;&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary, otherwi&s;e he is put to the torture until
<PB N="309" REF="319">
he confe&s;&s;es) the burghers of this &s;treet a&s;&s;emble; an advocate pleads in defence of the pri&s;oner, and another again&s;t him; the court of ju&s;tice give their opinion upon the point of law; and the majority of the burghers in que&s;tion determine the penalty. If the puni&s;h|ment be capital, there is, &s;trictly &s;peak|ing, no pardon, except it be obtained within twenty-four hours from the &s;o|vereign council of Berne; although it generally happens that eight days are granted for that purpo&s;e. When the criminal is &s;eized within the juri&s;dic|tion of the town; the pro&s;ecution is tried, and the burghers pronounce their &s;entence, in the town-hall: and in this ca&s;e there is no appeal. But, when he is taken within the di&s;trict of the bailiff, they a&s;&s;emble in his hou&s;e; and an appeal lies from their determi|nation to Berne. I have been the more particular in my enquiries concerning the mode of this criminal proce&s;s, from
<PB N="310" REF="320">
the &s;trong re&s;emblance it bears in many re&s;pects to our trial by juries.</P>
<P>Here is a celebrated academy for the &s;tudents of this country; as there is another at Berne for tho&s;e of the German di&s;trict: profe&s;&s;ors in every &s;cience are appointed by government; and there is a tolerable library for the u&s;e of the public. The <HI>manage</HI> of Mr. De Mezery, is by far the be&s;t of a great number we have &s;een: his &s;kill in hor&s;eman&s;hip, and judicious manner of conveying his in&s;tructions, de&s;erves the highe&s;t encomiums. His po&s;ition and fi|gure are firm and elegant, and the hor&s;es, which are re&s;erved for his own riding, are dre&s;&s;ed with great ta&s;te and preci&s;ion. His method of di&s;ciplining them is mild; becau&s;e, from his perfect knowledge of the nature of the animal, he forces them to nothing which they are not well qualified to perform.</P>
<P>I have had the good fortune, &s;everal times, to meet Ti&s;&s;ot, the celebrated phy|&s;ician
<PB N="311" REF="321">
of this place; well known in the literary world for his excellent writings upon &s;everal medical &s;ubjects. His con|ver&s;ation is uncommonly intere&s;ting; as, be&s;ides his &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion, he is well ver&s;ed in every branch of polite literature. His private character is no le&s;s re&s;pect|able than his public; and he is as much e&s;teemed for his great humanity as for his &s;uperior knowledge.</P>
<P>Lau&s;anne at pre&s;ent contains &s;carcely &s;even thou&s;and inhabitants; whereas, a few years ago, there were at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and: and indeed the whole Pays de Vaud is much le&s;s peopled than it was during the la&s;t century. This depopula|tion is owing to the encrea&s;e of luxury; which prevents the gentry from enter|ing into matrimonial engagements &s;o generally as they were heretofore ac|cu&s;tomed; and induces numbers of them continually to emigrate in order to engage in foreign &s;ervices. For, al|though the government of Berne is
<PB N="312" REF="322">
certainly very mild, and never lays on any additional taxes, nor ever encroaches upon the privileges of their &s;ubjects; yet, as the gentry are totally excluded from any &s;hare in the admini&s;tration of public affairs, and commerce is reckoned degrading, they have no other re&s;ource but in foreign &s;ervices. For this rea&s;on, many of them are male|contents, and would gladly exchange the mild republican form, under which they live, for a monarchical mode of government.</P>
<P>The road from hence to Vevay, is mo&s;t delightful: it lies along the &s;ides of the mountains, between continued ranges of beautiful vineyards. The indu&s;try of the Swi&s;s is no where more ob&s;erv|able than in the&s;e parts: the moun|tains in many places, though naturally con&s;i&s;ting of a bare &s;teep rock, are co|vered thick with vines. The &s;oil has been brought from other grounds, and is &s;upported by rows of little &s;tone walls
<PB N="313" REF="323">
rai&s;ed from the edge of the lake to the heights above. This di&s;trict between Lau&s;anne and Vevay is called <HI>La Vaux,</HI> and contains the two plea&s;ant little towns of Lutry and Cully; as al&s;o the two villages of St. Saphorin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the church of St. Saphorin, is an an|tient Roman mile-&s;tone, found near that village, with the following in&s;cription: <Q>TI. CLAVDIVS. DRVSI. F. <LB>CAES. AVG. GERM. <LB>PONT. MAX. TRIB. POT. VII. <LB>IMP. XII. P. P. COS. IIII. <LB>F A <LB>XXXVII.</Q>This in&s;cription a&s;certains two circum&s;tances, which have been frequently called in que&s;tion; namely, that the banks of the lake of Geneva, which border this part of Swi&s;&s;erland, were compri&s;ed within a Roman province, even &s;o early as the time of Claudius; and al&s;o, that <HI>Aventicum</HI> was the chief town of this part of Helvetia: for, the mile-&s;tones always referred to the capital town of the pro|vince in which they were placed. From St. Saphorin to <HI>Avenches</HI> is exactly 37,000 paces; which an&s;wer to the 37th mile-&s;tone.</P></NOTE> and Cor&s;ier: it is entirely hilly, ri&s;ing ab|ruptly
<PB N="314" REF="324">
from the lake. Above the vine|yards are rich meadows, and a continued fore&s;t.</P>
<P>Vevay is the principal town of the bailliage of that name: it is clean and well-built, &s;tands at the foot of the mountains on the edge of the water, and is one of the few towns in the can|ton of Berne which carries on any con&s;iderable trade. The borders of this part of the lake are much more con|tra&s;ted, wild, and picture&s;que, than tho&s;e about Geneva: the alps of Savoy boldly jut out into the water, and form a &s;emicircular chain of mountains that enclo&s;e the lake, except where they are divided by the Rhone; which flows into it a few leagues from Vevay.</P>
<P>Near Vevay is Clarens, and oppo&s;ite is Meillerie: the&s;e are the &s;cenes of Rou&s;&s;eau's Heloi&s;e. Accordingly I hired that novel at a circulating library in Lau&s;anne; and continued, all the way I pa&s;&s;ed, examining the po&s;ition of the
<PB N="315" REF="325">
country, and comparing it with the de|&s;criptions by that celebrated author. Little things may be magnified; but no pencil, however animated, can come up to the wonderful and &s;ublime works of nature; and even the warm colouring of Rou&s;&s;eau has not equalled the beauty of the &s;ituation. I read with attention the principal parts of that admirable performance; and now that I had the &s;cenery, as it were, before my eyes, I enjoyed in the peru&s;al &s;en&s;ations which I had never felt before. I dwelt more particularly, and with infinite plea&s;ure, upon that fine letter, in which St. Preux relates his expedition to Meillerie acro&s;s the lake: I con&s;ider it as the ma&s;ter|piece of the whole compo&s;ition; where the pa&s;&s;ions of love and de&s;pair are worked up almo&s;t to madne&s;s. I ob|&s;erved the dark gloomy rocks of Meil|lerie; and am convinced, from the ap|pearance of the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, that, had I been on the other &s;ide, I could have
<PB N="316" REF="326">
di&s;covered the very place to which St. Preux led his Julia, and of which he gives &s;o enchanting a de&s;cription. For, al|though there are no traces of any hi&s;tory like that of Julia in the&s;e parts; yet the &s;cenery is &s;trongly marked: and I am &s;atisfied that almo&s;t every &s;pot, which is mentioned in the letters, actually exi&s;ts in this romantic country. For, Rou&s;&s;eau him&s;elf pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at different parts on the borders of the lake, and particularly at Meillerie, about that period of his life when he may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have written his Heloi&s;e. Open that performance, read that let|ter, and con&s;ider that part of it, where St. Preux points out the number of towns and villages, the continued fer|tility and high cultivation of the <HI>Pays de Vaud,</HI> and then contra&s;ts it with the barren rocks of Chablais, exhibiting here and there a few in&s;ulated towns, which lie upon the very edge of the water; you will &s;ee at once, and in the &s;ame

<P>THE chain of mountains called the <HI>Jura,</HI> begins in the canton of Zuric, from thence extends along the Rhine, into the canton and bi&s;hopric of Ba&s;il, &s;tretches into the canton of So|leure and the principality of Neucha|tel, branches out towards the Pays de Vaud, &s;eparates that country from Franche Comt&egrave; and Burgundy, and continues beyond the frontiers of the Genevois as far as the Rhone. In va|rious parts this chain of mountains
<PB N="318" REF="328">
forms numberle&s;s &s;mall vallies upon the heighths; &s;everal of which are contained within the di&s;trict of the Pays de Vaud.</P>
<P>The valley of the lake of <HI>Joux,</HI> is &s;o called from a lake of that name, upon the top of that part of the Jura called Mount Joux; and which lies in the bailliage of Romain Motier. It is about twelve miles by five; of which a circuit of above twelve miles is oc|cupied by two lakes clo&s;e to each other, and which formerly, without doubt, made but one: the large&s;t of the&s;e is called the lake of Joux. This valley contains &s;everal &s;mall villages con&s;idera|bly peopled; and the whole is beauti|fully checkered with fine fore&s;ts, rich meadows, or flouri&s;hing fields of bar|ley and oats. Be&s;ides the&s;e two lakes, a little farther is a third, which lies in Franche Comt&egrave;. One &s;hore of the large&s;t of the&s;e lakes, is high rock, covered with wood; the oppo&s;ite &s;hore is a gentle a&s;cent, well cultivated and
<PB N="319" REF="329">
producing grain, backed by an abrupt ridge adorned with pines, beech, and oak. The &s;mall lake clo&s;e to it, is in its &s;hape more oval, richly bordered with corn-fields and cottages.</P>
<P>Near the &s;mall village of Abbaye, a rivulet gu&s;hes from the bottom of the rock, and lo&s;es it&s;elf in the large&s;t lake; the water whereof has no apparent out|let, but has certainly a &s;ubterraneous communication with the &s;maller lake. On the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the latter, a &s;tream i&s;&s;ues out, turns &s;ome mills, and then is lo&s;t in a hollow gulph, formed (I &s;uppo&s;e by the force of the current) in a perpendicular rock. About two miles farther, on the other &s;ide of the mountain, the river Orbe bur&s;ts forth, and is probably produced by the la&s;t|mentioned &s;tream here ingulphed.</P>
<P>This little vale is very populous, containing about three thou&s;and inha|bitants, all of them remarkably indu&s;|trious. Some few make watches, but
<PB N="320" REF="330">
the greate&s;t part are employed in poli&s;h|ing cry&s;tals, granites, marca&s;ites, &amp;c. In the &s;mall village of Pont, where we lodged, all the inhabitants, except one family, bear the &s;urname of Rochat; a name which al&s;o runs through the whole village of Charboniere, with the exception of only two families; and is prevalent likewi&s;e in that of Ab|baye: the whole number of the&s;e Ro|chats amounts to above a thou&s;and. I enquired whether they took the ap|pellation from any chief, as the Scot|ti&s;h clans do; or whether they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be de&s;cendents of the &s;ame family: I was a&s;&s;ured, that the latter is the fact, and that their ance&s;tors came originally from France.</P>
<P>In our a&s;cent to this delightful vale, and as we de&s;cended through a variety of hill, valley, wood, and lawn; we had a mo&s;t exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, compre|hending great part of the Pays de Vaud, the lake of Geneva with its moun|tainous
<PB N="321" REF="331">
boundary, and that of Neu|chatel. The&s;e two lakes appear, from that high point of view, to be nearly upon the &s;ame level<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to Mr. de Luc, the lake of Neucha|tel is 159 French feet above that of Geneva.</NOTE>, with no con&s;i|derable &s;well of the country interven|ing.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed through the beautiful val|ley of Romain Motier to Orbe; which, according to antiquarians, was the mo&s;t antient town, and once the mo&s;t power|ful, of all Helvetia. It was called <HI>Urba,</HI> and was the capital of the <HI>Pagus Ur|bigenus:</HI> no remains however exi&s;t at pre&s;ent of its antient &s;plendour. Some antique fortifications, an old ca&s;tle, and a round tower, are works probably of later and more turbulent times: they were erected, perhaps, when this coun|try was divided into a number of petty &s;overeignties.</P>
<P>Orbe is an old town, placed in a very romantic &s;ituation: the country which
<PB N="322" REF="332">
lies round it, is chiefly planted with vines. The town, which is governed by its own magi&s;trates, is compri&s;ed within the bailliage of Echalens, belong|ing to Berne and Fribourg: the&s;e two cantons alternately &s;end a bailiff, who re&s;ides at Echalens, and remains in of|fice during five years. When Berne ap|points the bailiff, an appeal lies from his deci&s;ions to the &s;overeign council of Fribourg; as it does to the government of Berne, when he is nominated by Fribourg. By the&s;e means a great check is laid upon the exactions of the bailiff: and I am informed, that ju&s;tice is no where more equally admini&s;tered than in the&s;e common bailliages of the two cantons above-mentioned.</P>
<P>From Orbe we de&s;cended into the plain, which &s;tretches to the lake of Yverdun. This plain was formerly covered as far as Entreroches (three leagues from its pre&s;ent po&s;ition) and probably farther, by that lake: it is
<PB N="323" REF="333">
now, for a con&s;iderable part, a great &s;wamp. We have taken up our lodgings at the baths of Yverdun, within a quar|ter of a mile of the town: the&s;e baths are &s;trongly &s;ulphureous, and much fre|quented during the &s;ummer months.</P>
<P>Yverdun is large, airy, and well|built with &s;tone; like all the towns I have hitherto &s;een in the <HI>Pays de Vaud:</HI> it &s;tands not far from the lake, in a &s;mall i&s;land formed by the two branches of the river Thiele. Between the town and the lake there is a plea&s;ant lawn extending to the water, and planted with avenues of lime-trees. As one looks from this plain along the lake, it is &s;kirted with high land, except on the oppo&s;ite northern &s;hore, the middle part of which is quite flat, and has much the appearance of a &s;ea view.</P>
<P>Yverdun carries on &s;ome trade, has a few manufactures of mu&s;lin and linen, and is one of the pa&s;&s;ages for the mer|chandi&s;e which is brought from Pied|mont
<PB N="324" REF="334">
to Germany. Literature flouri&s;hes to a very great degree in this town; which is celebrated al&s;o for its printing|pre&s;s. This pre&s;s was e&s;tabli&s;hed the beginning of the pre&s;ent century; but was entirely neglected until &s;ome years ago, when it was renewed, with more &s;ucce&s;s and with higher reputation than ever, by <HI>Felice,</HI> a Neapolitan of great learning and abilities.</P>
<P>The lake of Yverdun, or of Neu|chatel, &s;tretches from &s;outh to north about twenty miles in length, and in &s;ome places about five in breadth. The &s;outh-ea&s;t part of it, where we now are, is covered with country-hou&s;es, be|longing chiefly to the inhabitants of Berne. To-day we dined with a gen|tleman of that town, a member of the &s;overeign council; who&s;e acquaintance we made at the baths of Leuk: his country-hou&s;e &s;tands clo&s;e to the water at the village of Clendy; commanding a plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of the lake, and of the adjacent country.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="335">
It is &s;omewhat extraordinary, that the Swi&s;s (who&s;e country abounds with &s;ituations inconceivably noble and pic|ture&s;que, and where Nature wantons in all the luxuriant variety of her mo&s;t &s;trik|ing beauties) that the Swi&s;s &s;hould have adopted the dull and ta&s;tele&s;s unifor|mity of the French gardens. I have frequently ob&s;erved, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e romantic &s;cenes, a maje&s;tic fore&s;t &s;liced out into little regular allies; and at the very borders of the fine lakes, artificial pools of water edged with &s;un-burnt parterres.</P>

<P>WE &s;kirted the we&s;t &s;ide of the lake, through <HI>Grand&s;on,</HI> the principal town of a bailliage of that name, be|longing
<PB N="326" REF="336">
to Berne and Fribourg, and remarkable for the battle in which Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, was defeated by the Swi&s;s in 1476. We entered the principality of Neuchatel about &s;ix miles from that town, and pa&s;&s;ed through St. Aubin, Boudri, Co|lombier, &amp;c. each of them plea&s;ant vil|lages upon the borders of the water. The road runs along the &s;ide of the Jura, with the lake lying below it, through a country that re&s;embled, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the di&s;trict of La Vaux between Lau&s;anne and Vevay: the &s;ides of the Jura are almo&s;t the whole way covered with vines, &s;upported in many parts by low &s;tone walls. The bor|ders of the lake are more uniform than tho&s;e of the lake of Geneva; and do not ri&s;e into &s;uch high, irregular, and grote&s;que alps as the coa&s;t of Chablais. Towards Grand&s;on and St. Aubin, the country is more diver&s;ified with mea|dows and corn-fields; but nearer to
<PB N="327" REF="337">
Neuchatel the upper parts of the moun|tains are cloathed with fore&s;t, and the midland and lower parts entirely planted with vines.</P>
<P>Between the lake and the Jura there are &s;everal rivers, which bur&s;t out from the rock in very con&s;iderable &s;treams; and, after turning &s;everal mills, fall into the lake at a little di&s;tance from their &s;ource: mo&s;t of the rivers in this country are formed in the &s;ame man|ner. The large&s;t of the&s;e is that of La Serriere, near a &s;mall village of the &s;ame name, which we cro&s;&s;ed to-day in our way to Colombier, where we dined with a family who&s;e acquaintance we made at the baths of Leuk. We pa&s;&s;ed a very agreeable day with the&s;e amia|ble per&s;ons; by whom we were receiv|ed with that frankne&s;s and unaffected ea&s;e which characteri&s;es true politene&s;s. Indeed I cannot &s;peak too highly of that genuine and unartful good-breeding, which, in general, di&s;tingui&s;hes the Swi&s;s gentry.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="338">
After dinner &s;ome mu&s;icians of the country gave us the <HI>Renz des vaches:</HI> that famous air which was forbidden to be played among the Swi&s;s troops in the French &s;ervice; as it awakened in the &s;ol|diers &s;uch a longing recollection of their native country, that it often produced in them a &s;ettled melancholy, and occa|&s;ioned frequent de&s;ertion. The French call this &s;pecies of patriotic regret <HI>la maladie du pays.</HI> There is nothing, I think, peculiarly &s;triking in this tune; but, as it &s;eems to be compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t &s;imple notes, the powerful effect its melody has been found to have upon the Swi&s;s &s;oldiers, in a foreign land, is the le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing. Nothing indeed revives &s;o lively a remembrance of for|mer &s;cenes, as a piece of favourite mu&s;ic which we were accu&s;tomed to hear amid&s;t our earlie&s;t and deare&s;t con|nections: upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, a long train of a&s;&s;ociated ideas will nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e in the mind, and, if not totally
<PB N="329" REF="339">
&s;elfi&s;h, melt it into tenderne&s;s. It is ob|&s;ervable, that tho&s;e who inhabit moun|tainous countries are more &s;ubject to this <HI>maladie du pays</HI> than others: and no wonder; as their habits of life are e&s;&s;entially different from what they find in other parts. Accordingly, the Scotch highlanders, and the Bi&s;cayans, as well as the Swi&s;s, when ab&s;ent from their country, are peculiarly apt to be affected with every thing that recalls it to their minds.</P>
<P>Under the general name of Swi&s;&s;er|land, as under&s;tood by foreigners, the principality of <HI>Neuchatel</HI> and <HI>Vallengin,</HI> together with the <HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> the <HI>Vallais,</HI> and the republic of <HI>Geneva,</HI> are all com|pri&s;ed: but, &s;trictly &s;peaking, the&s;e are only allies of the Swi&s;s, and do not form any part of that di&s;trict, which is called Swi&s;&s;erland by the natives. The prin|cipality of Neuchatel and Vallengin are in alliance with the four neighbouring cantons, Berne, Lucerne, Fribourg, and
<PB N="330" REF="340">
Soleure: but be&s;ides this general con|federacy, the town of Neuchatel has a particular connection with the canton of Berne; the inhabitants of the for|mer being con&s;idered as com-burghers or fellow-citizens with tho&s;e of the la&s;t|mentioned canton. The whole princi|pality contains near forty thou&s;and in|habitants; of which there are three thou&s;and in the capital: it is there the governor re&s;ides, and the general admini|&s;tration of public affairs is carried on.</P>
<P>The town of Neuchatel is &s;mall. It lies partly upon the little plain between the lake and the Jura, and partly upon the declivity of that mountain: in con|&s;equence of which &s;ituation, &s;ome of its &s;treets are rather &s;teep. At the com|mencement of the pre&s;ent century, com|merce was almo&s;t wholly a &s;tranger here; as the ridiculous pride of its being deem|ed degrading generally prevailed among them. This &s;en&s;ele&s;s prejudice is now, however, well-nigh worn out; and a

con&s;iderable trade is carried on. The chief article of their exportation is wine, produced from the neighbouring vine|yards, and much e&s;teemed. Several manufactures al&s;o of cotton and mu&s;lin have been e&s;tabli&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s: and within the&s;e few years, the merchants of this town have rai&s;ed large fortunes.</P>

<P>I AM charmed with an expedition we have ju&s;t been making to the &s;um|mit of the Jura; and I will give you a &s;hort account of it, while the impre&s;|&s;ion remains warm upon my mind.</P>
<P>The principality of Neuchatel and Vallengin, &s;tretches from the lake to the limits of Franche Comt&egrave;; contain|ing in length, from north to &s;outh, about

twelve leagues, and about &s;ix in its greate&s;t breadth. The principality of Neuchatel occupies all the plain, toge|ther with the lower parts of the moun|tains: while Vallengin is totally enclo&s;|ed within the Jura. Parallel chains of the Jura run from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and form, in the mo&s;t elevated parts, &s;everal val|leys. The lower grounds of this chain are partly laid out in arable-land, but principally in vineyards: the higher con|&s;i&s;ts of a large tract of fore&s;t, which in many parts has been cleared away, and converted into con&s;iderable pa&s;ture-lands, intermixed with &s;ome fields of barley and oats. But what particularly de&s;erves the attention of every curious traveller in the&s;e valleys, is the &s;ingular genius and indu&s;try of the very populous in|habitants.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Vallengin,</HI> the ca|pital of the di&s;trict of that name; a &s;mall open burgh, with a modern ca&s;tle built on the ruins of an antient one.

We then cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Val de Ruz,</HI> which contains above twenty villages, mo&s;tly &s;ituated on both &s;ides at the foot of the mountains, which terminate the valley: the inhabitants in general are employed in agriculture, &s;ome few excepted, who follow occa&s;ionally the mechanical arts.</P>
<P>We arrived about mid-day at La Chaux de Fond, a large hand&s;ome village lying in a broad valley which borders upon Franche Comt&egrave;: from thence we proceeded to Locle in the &s;ame valley, through a continued range of plea&s;ing cottages, which &s;kirt both &s;ides of the road; and &s;uch are &s;cattered likewi&s;e all over the country. As the&s;e two little towns or villages carry on the &s;ame com|merce; I &s;hall comprehend them both under one common de&s;cription.</P>
<P>In the two burghs of La Chaux de Fond and Locle, together with the di&s;|tricts belonging to them, there may be in the whole about &s;ix thou&s;and &s;ouls. The genius and indu&s;try which &s;o re|markably

di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e &s;eque&s;tered people, is wonderful; as in this retired corner of the world, the mechanical arts flouri&s;h in their greate&s;t perfection. The inhabitants carry on an exten&s;ive commerce in lace, &s;tockings, cutlery, and other different kinds of mer|chandi&s;e of their own manufacture: but watch-making, and every branch of clock-work, are the articles in which they particularly and eminent|ly excel. They not only make every uten&s;il employed in tho&s;e arts, but have invented &s;everal: and all &s;orts of workmen nece&s;&s;ary for the completion of that branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch as painters, enamellers, engravers, gilders, &amp;c. are found in the&s;e villages; where it is &s;uppo&s;ed that, upon an average, about forty thou&s;and watches are yearly made. The genius and indu&s;try, in|deed, ob&s;ervable upon the&s;e mountains, exhibit a &s;cene uncommonly plea&s;ing; and no where, perhaps, (except in Ge|neva)
<PB N="335" REF="345">
are there &s;uch a number of peo|ple apparently &s;o much at their ea&s;e. Accordingly, as every individual is &s;ure, not only of obtaining a comfortable maintenance for him&s;elf, but of &s;oon placing his children al&s;o in a way of getting their own livelihood; they all marry very early: for, women and chil|dren are employed in &s;ome of the branches of watch-making; and a child but of ten years old may earn ten|pence a day, by giving the la&s;t poli&s;h to &s;teel in&s;truments, with the hand. And as to the men, there are few who do not get half-crown a day; and &s;ome, nine &s;hillings.</P>
<P>Not many years ago, the greate&s;t part of the&s;e valleys was almo&s;t one conti|nued fore&s;t; but the wonder-working powers of indu&s;try have happily changed the &s;cene into flouri&s;hing villages and fertile pa&s;tures. Population has en|crea&s;ed of cour&s;e; and the following fact will give you &s;ome idea how much
<PB N="336" REF="346">
it has encrea&s;ed:&mdash;Formerly the produce of the country was more than &s;ufficient for the con&s;umption of the inhabitants; at pre&s;ent, although it is con&s;iderably more cultivated, they draw &s;even-eighths of their provi&s;ion from Franche Comt&egrave;. And no wonder; for, be&s;ides the natu|ral effect of their frequent and early marriages; every &s;tranger, who brings a certificate of his good behaviour, is at liberty to &s;ettle here, and to carry on any trade he thinks proper, without the lea&s;t re&s;triction. Here, no apprentice|&s;hip is nece&s;&s;ary; nothing is contra|band; and indu&s;try exerts her&s;elf un|taxed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides tho&s;e particular arts I have al|ready mentioned, &s;ome of the inhabi|tants of Locle and La Chaux de Fond are well &s;killed likewi&s;e in other branches of mechanical &s;cience; and have invent|ed &s;everal u&s;eful mathematical and a&s;|tronomical in&s;truments. Among tho&s;e who have eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves
<PB N="337" REF="347">
in this way, is the famous Jaquet Droz, who is now at Paris; and who&s;e &s;on, if I am rightly informed, is at pre|&s;ent in England, exhibiting to the public &s;everal automatical figures of a very &s;in|gular and &s;urpri&s;ing con&s;truction: one of the&s;e plays upon the harp&s;ichord; another draws land&s;capes; and, what is &s;till more extraordinary, a third copies any word pre&s;ented to it, or writes down whatever the company &s;hall plea&s;e to dictate.

How much more laudably, and with equal &s;ucce&s;s, might the &s;ame talents and application have been employed in improving, or adding to, tho&s;e in&s;truments and apparatus, which are nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t and facili|tate the purpo&s;es of the a&s;tronomer and natural philo&s;opher!</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="348">
The origin of watch-making in this part of Swi&s;&s;erland, as related by Mr. O&s;terwald, antient banneret of Neu|chatel (the hi&s;toriographer of the&s;e mountains) is extremely curious; and the truth of his account was confirmed to me by &s;everal arti&s;ts both of Locle and La Chaux de Fond. In 1679, one of the inhabitants brought with him from London a watch, the fir&s;t that had been &s;een in the&s;e parts; which hap|pening to be out of order, he ventured to tru&s;t it in the hands of one Daniel John Richard, of La Sagne. Richard, after examining the mechani&s;m with great attention, conceived him&s;elf ca|pable, and was determined to attempt, to make a watch from the model before him: but to this end he was de&s;titute of every other a&s;&s;i&s;tance than the powers of his own native genius. Accordingly he employed a whole year in inventing and in fini&s;hing the &s;everal in&s;truments previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary for executing his purpo&s;e; and in &s;ix months from that
<PB N="339" REF="349">
period, by the &s;ole force of his own pe|netrating and per&s;evering talents, he produced a complete watch. But his ambition and indu&s;try did not &s;top here: be&s;ides applying him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;sfully to the invention of &s;everal new in&s;tru|ments u&s;eful for the perfection of his work, he took a journey to Geneva, where he gained con&s;iderable informa|tion in the art. He continued for &s;ome time the only man in the&s;e parts who could make a watch; but bu&s;ine&s;s en|crea&s;ing, he took in, and in&s;tructed, &s;e|veral a&s;&s;ociates; by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he was enabled to &s;upply from his &s;ingle &s;hop all the demands of the neighbour|ing country. Towards the beginning of the pre&s;ent century he removed to Locle, where he died in 1741, leaving five &s;ons, who all of them followed their father's occupation. From the&s;e the knowledge and practice of the art gradually &s;pread it&s;elf, till it at length became almo&s;t the univer&s;al bu&s;ine&s;s of

the inhabitants, and the principal cau&s;e of the populou&s;ne&s;s, of the&s;e mountains.</P>
<P>But it is not merely in the articles above-mentioned, that the inventive ge|nius of this mechanical people is ob|&s;ervable; it di&s;covers it&s;elf upon all oc|ca&s;ions where it can be applied to the purpo&s;es of their convenience and ac|commodations. To give you an in|&s;tance: the rocks in mo&s;t parts of the alps being exceedingly hard and &s;olid; the water can only make its way along their &s;ides, and ru&s;h down in perpetual torrents: but, the &s;trata which compo&s;e the Jura being le&s;s firm and compact; the rains and melted &s;now penetrate with impetuo&s;ity into the crevices, and only di&s;cover them&s;elves by breaking out into rivulets at the bottom of the mountains. Now the pea&s;ants, in or|der to avail them&s;elves of this peculi|arity, have erected mills at a great ex|pence, and with inconceivable labour, &s;ome yards under the rock; which are
<PB N="341" REF="351">
turned by tho&s;e internal torrents of wa|ter, that force their way through the cre|vices above-mentioned. And for this purpo&s;e the builders have con&s;tructed wheels, in places where it &s;eemed &s;carcely practicable; and have invented new modes of &s;caffolding, and a great va|riety of other ingenious contrivances in order to facilitate their work.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the&s;e &s;everal di&s;|tricts are exceedingly courteous, and ready to give every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power to &s;trangers who vi&s;it their country. They are in general very well informed in &s;everal branches of knowledge; and, as they u&s;ually employ their lei&s;ure hours in reading, there are circulating libraries to be found in many of the villages.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es are in general &s;mall, but hand&s;ome, and well-built: &s;eve|ral of the&s;e, which we entered, were furni&s;hed with a degree of neatne&s;s, and even elegance, peculiarly &s;triking. Indeed luxury (or what according to
<PB N="342" REF="352">
the &s;implicity of manners is here called &s;o) the never-failing attendant upon &s;uc|ce&s;sful indu&s;try, has made no incon&s;i|derable progre&s;s in the&s;e mountains: of which I had a curious proof from an inhabitant of Locle; who &s;eriou&s;ly com|plained to me, that it was now no un|common circum&s;tance for a ma&s;ter of a family to carry his wife to &s;ee a play at Be&s;an&ccedil;on; and that there were, at this time, at lea&s;t ten hair-dre&s;&s;ers e&s;|tabli&s;hed at Locle; whereas &s;ome few years ago there was but one to be found in the town, and in its whole di&s;trict.</P>
<P>The rock which forms the ba&s;e of the Jura, is mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of calca|rious &s;tone; and perhaps there is no &s;pot in Europe where one finds, in &s;o &s;mall a &s;pace, &s;o large a quantity of petrified &s;hells and marine plants.

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>NEUCHATEL and Vallengin once formed two di&s;tinct principalities; each having a &s;eparate and independent government: but for &s;ome time pa&s;t they have been united into one. By the death
<PB N="344" REF="354">
of the dutche&s;s of Nemours, in 1707, the &s;overeignty of Neuchatel and Vallengin became vacant; to which, as heir to the prince of Orange, Frederic I. king of Pru&s;&s;ia (among&s;t many others) put in his claim: and his right was acknowledged by the &s;tates of the country. After his death it de&s;cended to his &s;on Frederic William, who tran&s;mitted it with his other dominions to the pre&s;ent monarch Frederic II.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of Neuchatel is a li|mited monarchy. The machine of this government is indeed actuated by &s;uch nice &s;prings, and its wheels are &s;o ex|ceedingly complicated, that it is very difficult for a &s;tranger to di&s;tingui&s;h, with any degree of accuracy, the prerogatives of the &s;overeign, and the franchi&s;es of the people: particularly as &s;ome even of their mo&s;t important privileges, depend upon mutual acquie&s;cence and immemo|rial cu&s;tom, and not upon any written laws. I &s;hall endeavour, however, as well as I am able, to trace the principal features of this government; the re&s;ult
<PB N="345" REF="355">
of my be&s;t enquiries during the &s;hort time I continued in the country, and which I have &s;ince compared with all the printed accounts I have been able to col|lect.</P>
<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Frederic I. cer|tain general articles were drawn up, which in a great mea&s;ure marked out the prero|gatives of the prince, and the liberties of the &s;ubject; and the&s;e articles were &s;igned and ratified by the king. But be&s;ides the&s;e general articles, which his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty upon his acce&s;&s;ion promi&s;ed to pre&s;erve inviolate; others were afterwards added at the pacification of 1768: and the&s;e put an end to the di&s;pute between the &s;ove|reign and his &s;ubjects of this principality. By this pacification, the king not only re|newed his a&s;&s;ent to the <HI>general</HI> articles; but al&s;o explained them, wherever the tenor of them had been mi&s;taken; ex|pre&s;sly confirming al&s;o &s;everal other pri|vileges in favour of the people, which had hitherto been equivocal, or not duly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t important of the&s;e general articles are:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the &s;overeign promi&s;es to
<PB N="346" REF="356">
maintain the reformed religion as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; and to tolerate no other &s;ect, except within the di&s;tricts of <HI>Landeron</HI> and <HI>Cro&s;&s;ier,</HI> where the catholic religion is dominant.</P>
<P N="2">2. That no per&s;on but a native of the country, although he may be naturali&s;ed, is capable of holding any charge civil or military, excepting that of governor, who may be a foreigner; and the &s;ame inca|pacity is extended even to natives, who are in the &s;ervice of any foreign prince what&s;oever.</P>
<P N="3">3. That all the &s;ubjects have a right to enter into the &s;ervice of any foreign power what&s;oever; provided that power, whom they &s;erve, be not in actual war again&s;t the prince, as &s;overeign of <HI>Neu|chatel:</HI> and that in ca&s;e the &s;overeign be engaged in any war, which no way con|cerns Neuchatel; that &s;tate &s;hall conti|nue neuter, except the Helvetic body take part in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The latter clau&s;e of this article is not &s;o clearly worded as it might have been; from a delicacy, I &s;uppo&s;e, of not expre&s;sly &s;tipulating, that the &s;tate of Neuchatel and Vallengin may oppo&s;e their &s;ove|reign by arms, in ca&s;e the Swi&s;s &s;hould be engaged in any war again&s;t him. It is evident, however, that they con&s;ider their connection with the Helve|tic body, as of &s;uperior obligation to that with their prince, as &s;overeign of Neuchatel and Vallengin.</P>
<P>The remarkable clau&s;e in que&s;tion is as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Et qu'en outre et conform&egrave;ment &agrave; des articles expr&egrave;s et formels des franchi&s;es tant de la bourgeoi&s;ie de Neuf|ch&acirc;tel que de celle de Vallengin, cet Etat ne pui&s;&s;e &eacute;tre engag&eacute; dans aucune guerre, ni les &s;ujets d'icelui oblig&eacute;s d'y marcher, que ce ne &s;oit pour la propre guerre du Prince, c'e&s;t &agrave; dire, pour la defence de l'Etat, et pour les guerres que le Prince pourroit avoir en tant que &s;ouverain de Neufch&acirc;tel et non autrement: en &s;orte que s'il avoit guerre pour rai&s;on de quelque autre Etat, terres et &s;eigneuries, l'Etat de Neufch&acirc;tel ne &s;oit point oblig&eacute; d'y entrer; mais en ce cas devra demeurer dans la neutra|lit&eacute;, &agrave; moins que tout le corps Helvetique en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral n'y prit part et int&eacute;r&ecirc;t.</HI></Q></P></NOTE>.</P>

4. That ju&s;tice be equitably admini|&s;tered: and, for this purpo&s;e, that the three e&s;tates of Neuchatel and Vallengin &s;hall be a&s;&s;embled yearly.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the magi&s;trates and officers of ju&s;tice, in&s;tead of holding their employ|ments during plea&s;ure, &s;hall enjoy them during their good behaviour. And, by the late pacification it was farther agreed, that the prince is not him&s;elf the judge of their good behaviour; but that in order to be deprived of their places, they mu&s;t be fully
<PB N="348" REF="358">
convicted of malver&s;ation in office, by cer|tain judges at Neuchatel appointed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the &s;overeign &s;hall take the accu&s;tomed oath upon his acce&s;&s;ion; and promi&s;e to maintain all the rights, li|berties, franchi&s;es, and cu&s;toms, written or unwritten.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential laws of this con&s;titution, de|pends entirely upon immemorial u&s;age; for, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the &s;overeign &s;hall be con&s;i|dered as re&s;ident only at Neuchatel,"</Q> is in the number of their unwritten laws. Now it is this law, in conjunction with the third article ju&s;t cited, that forms the whole ba&s;is of their civil liberty. By the former, the prince, when ab&s;ent, can only addre&s;s his &s;ubjects through his go|vernor and the council of &s;tate; and no &s;ubject can be tried out of the country, or otherwi&s;e than by the judges appoint|ed by the con&s;titution: by the latter, &s;hould the king of Pru&s;&s;ia be at war with all Germany; the people of Neuchatel and Vallengin are by no means obliged to take up arms in his defence; but in|dividuals may even &s;erve again&s;t him, &s;o
<PB N="349" REF="359">
long as the powers whom they &s;erve, are not engaged in ho&s;tilities again&s;t their country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This right they &s;till pre&s;erve, notwith&s;tanding all the attempts of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia to deprive them of it. The following anecdote I had from a gen|tleman of Neuchatel, who was per&s;onally acquainted with the officer concerned:</P>
<P>At the celebrated battle of Ro&s;bach, when the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch gained a complete victory over the French army, an officer in that &s;ervice was taken pri&s;oner. He had behaved in &s;o gallant a manner, that the king, &s;truck with his valour, a&s;ked him his name, and his country: the officer replying, that he was of Neuchatel: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You are my &s;ubject," &s;aid that monarch, "and yet you &s;erve again&s;t me!"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I make u&s;e of the privilege," returned the officer, "which I enjoy as a native of Neuchatel."</Q> Soon af|ter this, the king &s;ent a letter to his re&s;ident at Neu|chatel, in which he remon&s;trated again&s;t this right: the letter was laid before the people. The three communities of Neuchatel, Landeron, and Boudry, po&s;itively refu&s;ed to renounce this privilege; that of Vallengin, on the contrary, i&s;&s;ued out orders to all the officers of their di&s;trict, who were in the French army, immediately to quit that &s;ervice, under pain of being deprived of their burgher&s;hip. The officers to a man remained firm in their refu&s;al: at length the &s;ubject of di&s;pute was dropped, and the recu&s;ants continued to hold, unmole&s;ted, their rights of bur|gher&s;hip.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e general articles, that com|prehend the privileges of the people at
<PB N="350" REF="360">
large; there are others which the &s;ove|reign is equally bound to maintain, re|lating to the town of Neuchatel and the di&s;trict of Vallengin, in particular.</P>
<P>The prince confers nobility, and no|minates to the principal offices of &s;tate, both civil and military, except &s;ome few, which the people have a right to ap|point: the <HI>chatelains</HI> and mayors, who pre&s;ide in the &s;everal courts of ju&s;tice, are al&s;o of his nomination. His re|venues are very moderate, &s;carcely a|mounting to &pound;.5,000 a year. They ari&s;e from certain domains belonging to the &s;overeign, from a &s;mall land tax, and from the tythes of wine and corn, which are mo&s;tly paid according to an antient, and con&s;equently very low, va|luation. With regard to commerce; no &s;ubject pays any duties either of impor|tation or exportation, except for foreign wines imported into the town of Neu|chatel.</P>
<P>During the ab&s;ence of the prince, he is repre&s;ented by a governor of his own ap|pointing; who enjoys con&s;iderable ho|nours indeed, but his authority is very limited. He convokes the three e&s;tates;
<PB N="351" REF="361">
pre&s;ides in that a&s;&s;embly; and has the ca&s;ting vote in ca&s;e of an equality of voices: he has the power al&s;o, in crimi|nal ca&s;es, of pardoning, or of mitigat|ing the &s;entence. In his ab&s;ence his place is &s;upplied by the &s;enior coun&s;ellor of &s;tate.</P>
<P>The three e&s;tates of Neuchatel, form the &s;uperior tribunal of this country; and to them lies an appeal from the in|ferior courts of ju&s;tice. They are com|po&s;ed of twelve judges, divided into three e&s;tates: the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of the four &s;enior coun&s;ellors of &s;tate, who are no|ble: the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> of the four <HI>chatelains</HI> of Landeron, Boudry, Valde Travers, and Thielle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The principality of Neuchatel is divided into a certain number of di&s;tricts; &s;ome of which are de|nominated <HI>chatellanies,</HI> and others <HI>mayoralties.</HI> The chiefs of the former are called <HI>chatelains,</HI> and of the latter <HI>mayors:</HI> in every other re&s;pect their office and their power is the &s;ame.</NOTE>; and in ca&s;e the&s;e cannot &s;it in per&s;on, their place is &s;upplied by the re&s;pective mayors of the principality of Neuchatel, according to a certain order expre&s;sly regulated: the <HI>third</HI> e&s;tate is compo&s;ed of four coun&s;ellors of the town of Neuchatel.

<P>The&s;e three e&s;tates are not, as &s;everal authors have &s;uppo&s;ed, the repre&s;enta|tives of the people; nor do they po&s;&s;e&s;s the legi&s;lative authority. They are, pro|perly &s;peaking, the &s;upreme court of ju|dicature, which receives all appeals, and decides finally all cau&s;es, even tho&s;e re|lating to the &s;overeignty of the country: a power which they exerci&s;ed in the year 1707, upon the extinction of the direct line in the per&s;on of the dutche&s;s of Nemours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be here worth remarking, that the three e&s;tates decided the famous cau&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in 1707, as a proce&s;s between the &s;everal claimants of the &s;overeignty. But if (in ca&s;e of failure of claim|ants) a new &s;overeign were to be cho&s;en, or a new form of government to be e&s;tabli&s;hed; this would no longer be con&s;idered as the affair of a court of judi|cature: the que&s;tion would come before the people a&s;&s;embled by means of their repre&s;entatives, the de|puties of the four communities of Neuchatel, Lan|deron, Boudry, and Vallengin.</NOTE>.</P>

The council of &s;tate is inve&s;ted with the ordinary admini&s;tration of govern|ment; has the &s;uperintendence of the general police; and is entru&s;ted with the execution of the laws.

<P>The town of Neuchatel enjoys very con&s;iderable privileges: it has the care of the police within its own di&s;trict, and is governed by its own magi&s;tracy, con&s;i&s;ting of a great and little council. I will not trouble you with a detail of the &s;everal departments; but I cannot omit mention|ing the <HI>mini&s;traux;</HI> becau&s;e the members
<PB N="354" REF="364">
of that body form the third e&s;tate, when|ever it is propo&s;ed to frame new laws, or to amend old ones. The <HI>mini&s;traux</HI> are a kind of committee from the council of the town, and are entru&s;ted with the admini|&s;tration of the police. They con&s;i&s;t of the two pre&s;idents of that council, four ma&s;ter-burghers drawn from the little council, and the <HI>banneret</HI> or guardian of the liberties of the people. The &s;ix for|mer are changed every two years; the banneret is cho&s;en by the general a&s;&s;em|bly of the citizens, and continues in of|fice &s;ix years.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lative authority is divided in &s;o complicated a manner, that it would be difficult to &s;ay preci&s;ely where it ab&s;o|lutely re&s;ides: perhaps the following ac|count of the per&s;ons concerned, and of the forms ob&s;erved, in enacting and in promulgating new laws, may &s;omewhat a&s;&s;i&s;t in clearing the difficulty.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the cau&s;es are decided by the three e&s;tates a&s;&s;embled (as I men|tioned above) in the month of May; the four judges, who form the third e&s;tate, retire; and their place is &s;upplied by the four <HI>mini&s;traux,</HI> who repre&s;ent the council
<PB N="355" REF="365">
of the town. The attorney-general then de&s;ires the members of the three e&s;tates to take into con&s;ideration, whether it be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to frame any new laws, or to make any amendments in the old ones. If any new ordinance is propo&s;ed; a de|claration is drawn up, and delivered to the council of &s;tate for their delibera|tion, whether any thing therein is con|trary to the prerogatives of the prince, or to the intere&s;t of the public: from thence it is communicated to the council of the town, to be examined, whether it in|fringes the privileges of the citizens of Neuchatel. If it be adopted by the coun|cil of &s;tate, and the council of the town; it is propo&s;ed to the prince for his ap|probation or rejection: in the former ca&s;e, it is again carried before the three e&s;tates, and publicly read; after which the governor, or pre&s;ident, declares the approbation of the &s;overeign. It is then promulgated, or, as the expre&s;&s;ion is, pa&s;&s;ed into a law by the three e&s;tates.</P>
<P>Since the acce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Bran|denbourg, the people of Vallengin are al|ways con&s;ulted upon the framing of any new laws. For this purpo&s;e the three
<PB N="356" REF="366">
ma&s;ter-burghers of Vallengin examine, whether it contains any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with the franchi&s;es of the people of that di&s;trict: and, in that ca&s;e, they have the power of remon&s;trating to the governor in council.</P>
<P>From all this detail it &s;hould &s;eem, that the legi&s;lative authority re&s;ides conjunc|tively in the prince, the council of &s;tate, and the town; that the people of Val|lengin have a kind of negative voice; and that the three e&s;tates propo&s;e and promulgate the laws.</P>
<P>Every year, after the breaking-up of the a&s;&s;embly of the three e&s;tates of Neu|chatel; the three e&s;tates of Vallengin, as con&s;tituting the &s;upreme court of ju|dicature for that country, meet at their capital burgh, and decide finally on all appeals from the inferior courts of ju&s;tice. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e three e&s;tates con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ame four noble coun&s;ellors of &s;tate, who &s;it in the fir&s;t of the three e&s;tates of Neuchatel; four mayors of the county of Vallengin compo&s;e the <HI>&s;econd</HI> e&s;tate; and four members of the court of ju&s;tice of Vallengin, nominated by the mayor of that burgh, con&s;titute the <HI>third.</HI> The
<PB N="357" REF="367">
governor, or, in his ab&s;ence, the &s;enior coun&s;ellor, pre&s;ides, as in tho&s;e of Neu|chatel. The&s;e three e&s;tates of Vallengin have no interference in the framing of the laws: but, after they have been enacted or amended at Neuchatel, in the man|ner above-mentioned, they are &s;imply re|mitted to them by the &s;ollicitor-general, and publicly read before them.</P>
<P>The people of the di&s;trict of Vallen|gin a&s;&s;emble every three years in an open plain, in order to elect their three <HI>ma&s;ter-burghers,</HI> as they are &s;tyled; who are re&s;pectively cho&s;en from among the inhabitants of the burgh of Vallengin, of the Val de Ruz, and of the moun|tains. The function of the&s;e ma&s;ter|burghers is to watch over the general intere&s;ts of the people: they are al&s;o in &s;ome ca&s;es their deputies, and ap|pear at Neuchatel in their name, when|ever they are &s;ummoned by the gover|nor and council of &s;tate, in relation to any affair which particularly concerns their country.</P>
<P>The principality of Neuchatel is di|vided into a certain number of di&s;tricts, each of which has its criminal courts
<PB N="358" REF="368">
of ju&s;tice: in the county of Vallengin there is but one for the whole di&s;trict. The &s;pirit of their criminal laws is un|commonly mild; and the penalty an|nexed to each tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is marked out with a preci&s;ion, which leaves no part of the &s;entence to the arbitrary de|termination of the judges. The great circum&s;pection ob&s;erved in their judicial proceedings, may &s;ometimes indeed fa|vour the e&s;cape of the criminal: but the very few in&s;tances which occur of atrocious crimes, is a proof that this humane caution is no encouragement to tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; as it is a &s;trong pre&s;ump|tion al&s;o of the general good morals of the people. In a word, and to &s;peak of the temper of their legi&s;lation in the highe&s;t terms of encomium, as well as with the &s;tricte&s;t truth; per&s;onal li|berty is as tenderly and as &s;ecurely pro|tected by the laws of this country, as by tho&s;e of our own mo&s;t invaluable con&s;titution.</P>
<P>When the criminal is arre&s;ted, he is immediately brought to trial: after which, the &s;entence is read to him in pri&s;on. The next morning the pri&s;oner
<PB N="359" REF="369">
is again brought before the judges, a&s;|&s;embled in the <HI>open air;</HI> the whole for|mer proceedings on the trial are read aloud, and the judges once more deliver their opinion: by the&s;e means time is given for farther deliberation. In ca&s;e the &s;entence is capital; the governor is made acquainted without delay with the circum&s;tances of the crime: and if he does not remit or &s;often the puni&s;h|ment, the &s;entence is immediately put in execution. I am &s;orry to add, that <HI>torture</HI> (though &s;eldom made u&s;e of) is not ab&s;olutely aboli&s;hed: it is the only circum&s;tance wanting to render their code of penal laws, an admirable model of ju&s;tice tempered with humanity.</P>
<P>Such are the general outlines of this remarkable con&s;titution, by which the liberties of the people are as well, and perhaps better, &s;ecured than even in the democratical cantons: for, although the mo&s;t de&s;potic prince in Germany is &s;overeign, his power is exceedingly li|mited. Among tho&s;e circum&s;tances with which I was more particularly &s;truck in this government, I cannot but mention the very liberal encouragement given to
<PB N="360" REF="370">
all &s;trangers, who choo&s;e to &s;ettle in the country. They enjoy every po&s;&s;ible pri|vilege of trade and commerce; and one can &s;carce meet with any &s;tate, where fewer e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinctions are made be|tween the&s;e and the natives. I have al|ready ob&s;erved to you, the good effects which this enlarged policy has had, with|in the pre&s;ent century, on the popula|tion of Neuchatel and Vallengin: where|as, a narrower and more contracted prin|ciple in &s;ome of the neighbouring Swi&s;s cantons, unwi&s;ely with-holding them from giving encouragement to the &s;ettling of &s;trangers among them; has occa&s;ioned, and continues to occa&s;ion, a very ma|nife&s;t decrea&s;e of their people.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Morat, <DATE>Sept. 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN our way to Avenches we cro&s;&s;ed the river Thiele, which i&s;&s;ues from the lake of Neuchatel, and di&s;charges it&s;elf into that of Bienne: this river &s;eparates the principality of Neuchatel
<PB N="361" REF="371">
from the canton of Berne. Thiele is a di&s;trict of the province of Neucha|tel, and contains &s;everal villages in a tract of level country which produces wine, corn, and fruit: a &s;pirit of in|du&s;try prevails among the inhabitants, particularly tho&s;e of the villages of Thiele and St. Blai&s;e.</P>
<P>Morat is a bailliage belonging to Berne and Fribourg: the reformation was in|troduced here in 1530, by the majority of voices, in pre&s;ence of the deputies of Berne and Fribourg. The free &s;pirit of the Swi&s;s governments is in no in|&s;tance more remarkably apparent, than by the mode they ob&s;erved in embracing, or rejecting, the reformation; as, in many other towns be&s;ides Morat, the que&s;tion was fairly put to the vote, and the mi|nority generally &s;ubmitted to the deci|&s;ion of the greater number, with perfect acquie&s;cence.</P>
<P>This town &s;tands upon the edge of a &s;mall lake (about &s;ix miles long, and two broad) in the mid&s;t of a well-cul|tivated country. The lakes of Morat and Neuchatel are parallel to each other, and &s;eparated only by a &s;mall hill: the former
<PB N="362" REF="372">
is the highe&s;t; for, it di&s;charges it&s;elf by means of the river Broye, into the latter. According to Mr. de Luc, the lake of Morat is fifteen French feet (about &s;ixteen of our mea&s;ure) above the level of that of Neuchatel. Both the&s;e lakes, as well as that of Bienne, formerly ex|tended much farther than their pre&s;ent limits: and I have little doubt, from the po&s;ition of the country, that they were once united.</P>
<P>Morat is celebrated for the ob&s;tinate &s;iege it &s;u&s;tained in 1476 again&s;t Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy; which was followed by the battle of Morat: in this famous engagement, the duke was routed, and his whole army almo&s;t entirely de|&s;troyed, by the confederate Swi&s;s troops. Not far from the town, and clo&s;e to the high road, there &s;till remains a monu|ment of this victory: it is a &s;quare build|ing, filled with the bones of the &s;oldiers belonging to the duke of Burgundy's army, who were &s;lain at the &s;iege and in the battle: and indeed, by the quantity of the&s;e bones, it appears, that the num|ber of the &s;laughtered was con&s;iderable. Over the building are &s;everal in&s;criptions
<PB N="363" REF="373">
in Latin and German, relative to that memorable victory. I tran&s;cribed the fol|lowing on account of its elegant conci&s;e|ne&s;s:<Q>Deo Opt: Max: <LB>Caroli Inclyti et Forti&s;&s;imi <LB>Burgundiae Ducis Exercitus <LB>Muratum ob&s;idens ab Helvetiis <LB>Cae&s;us hoc &s;ui Monumentum reliquit <LB>Ann: 1476.</Q></P>
<P>This war, which Charles the Bold carried on again&s;t the Swi&s;s with a te|merity peculiar to him&s;elf, forms a me|morable aera in the hi&s;tory of this coun|try; and was attended with &s;ome very extraordinary circum&s;tances. From the time of the famous revolution in 1308, which gave ri&s;e to the Helvetic confede|racy, to the end of the following cen|tury, the Swi&s;s republics &s;tripped the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria of all their territories that lay within Swi&s;&s;erland; and conti|nued in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, notwith|&s;tanding the various attempts made by the different dukes to recover their lo&s;t domains. Among the&s;e, Sigi&s;mond the Simple, archduke of Au&s;tria of the branch
<PB N="364" REF="374">
of Tyrol, was more particularly engaged in perpetual ho&s;tilities with the Swi&s;s cantons, and their allies: for, his he|reditary dominions in Suabia and Al|&s;ace bordered upon Swi&s;&s;erland, and in|duced him to enter more frequently into the&s;e quarrels, than the other branch of that hou&s;e, which was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the imperial throne.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the&s;e ho&s;tilities, Si|gi&s;mond was compelled to cede a con&s;i|derable part of his territories to the Swi&s;s republics; particularly the rich country of Thurgaw was yielded to the &s;even cantons, which at that period compo&s;ed the Helvetic league<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Berne obtained the co-regency of Thurgaw at the peace of Araw, 1712.</NOTE>. The&s;e repeated lo&s;&s;es, and the humiliating conditions of peace he was con&s;trained to accept in 1468, filled him with re&s;entment; and he endeavoured to engage &s;ome of the neighbouring powers to join with him in a confederacy again&s;t the Swi&s;s cantons. For this purpo&s;e, he fir&s;t applied to Louis XI. king of France; but not &s;uc|ceeding, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="375">
That prince having &s;ucceeded to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Franche Comt&egrave;, Burgundy, Artois, and Flanders, together with the greate&s;t part of the now United Pro|vinces; his revenues were as ample, and his territories as exten&s;ive, as tho&s;e of the mo&s;t potent &s;overeign of his time. Magnificent, impetuous, and enterpri&s;ing, he &s;et no bounds to his re&s;tle&s;s ambi|tion; nor neglected any opportunity of enlarging his domains and aggrandi&s;ing his power. He had formed the plan of erecting his dominions into a monarchy; and had already in imagination appro|priated to him&s;elf Lorraine and part of Swi&s;&s;erland; which he propo&s;ed to con|quer, and annex to his hereditary terri|tories.</P>
<P>A prince of &s;uch a character could not but be well-di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to any overtures, or to undertake any war, that might advance his projected &s;chemes. Accordingly, Charles received with eager|ne&s;s the propo&s;itions which Sigi&s;mond made him; flattered him with the hopes of be&s;towing upon him in marriage his daughter Mary, heire&s;s of his exten&s;ive dominions; and prevailed upon that cre|dulous
<PB N="366" REF="376">
prince to &s;urrender to him Sund|gaw, Al&s;ace, Bri&s;gaw, and the four Fo|re&s;t-towns, as a pledge for the &s;ecurity of eighty thou&s;and florins: upon the re|payment of which &s;um, the provinces in que&s;tion were to be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>By this treaty, Sigi&s;mond acquired a &s;um of money to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his pre|parations again&s;t the Swi&s;s; protected, as he thought, his hereditary dominions from their enterpri&s;es; and &s;ecured a powerful ally again&s;t the antient ene|mies of his family. The rever&s;e, how|ever, proved to be the event: for, by a &s;trange fatality, this treaty, which was to cement the union of the two princes, and to engage them to attack conjointly that formidable people; &s;erved only to divide the contracting parties; and oc|ca&s;ioned the fir&s;t perpetual alliance be|tween the Swi&s;s cantons and a prince of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>Charles, upon the conclu&s;ion of this alliance, informed the Swi&s;s cantons, that he had taken Sigi&s;mond under his pro|tection, and would defend him to the ut|mo&s;t of his power. Meanwhile, the bai|liffs, whom he placed over his new-ac|quired
<PB N="367" REF="377">
territories in Al&s;ace, oppre&s;&s;ed the people; laid embargoes upon the com|merce of Mulhau&s;en, a &s;mall town con|federated with the cantons; and withheld the rents of the e&s;tates belonging to the Swi&s;s in Sundgaw and Al&s;ace.</P>
<P>The&s;e grievances were laid before Charles in an emba&s;&s;y, which Berne di&s;|patched to his court in the name of the allied cantons. The duke received it with haughtine&s;s; and after having obliged the deputies to kneel down, while they de|livered in their remon&s;trance, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them without an an&s;wer. This di&s;dainful and ignominious treatment was ill brooked by a free people, unaccu&s;tomed to crouch before the in&s;olence of power; and the warmth of their ju&s;t indignation was &s;till more inflamed by the artful policy of Louis XI. who, jealous of the duke of Burgundy's power, now entered into a defen&s;ive alliance with the eight cantons, in conjunction with the republics of Fri|bourg and Soleure, in order to counteract the dangerous de&s;igns of that ambitious prince.</P>
<P>But Louis &s;till farther &s;trengthened the Swi&s;s, by effecting a reconciliation be|tween
<PB N="368" REF="378">
them and Sigi&s;mond: for, the latter had no &s;ooner &s;urrendered to Charles tho&s;e towns which he had mortgaged to him upon the terms above-mentioned, than he began to be &s;en&s;ible of the error he had committed. The duke of Bur|gundy not only oppre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e people, but &s;eemed determined, even &s;hould the 80,000 florins be repayed, to keep po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e conditional territories: and he avoided al&s;o the fulfilling of the promi&s;e he had made of be&s;towing his daughter upon the archduke. From the&s;e con&s;iderations, the latter was ea&s;ily in|duced, through the mediation of Louis, to throw him&s;elf under the protection of the Swi&s;s; and he concluded with them the famous treaty, which was confirmed the twentieth of January, 1474, in the general diet a&s;&s;embled at Lucerne.</P>
<P>This alliance is called the <HI>hereditary union;</HI> an appellation, appropriated to the treaties made with the hou&s;e of Au&s;|tria; as tho&s;e, contracted with France, are denominated treaties of <HI>perpetual peace.</HI> By the alliance in que&s;tion, Sigi&s;mond renounced all right to the provinces which the Swi&s;s had conquered from the hou&s;e
<PB N="369" REF="379">
of Au&s;tria: the two contracting parties entered into a defen&s;ive alliance, and en|gaged to guarantee reciprocally each other's territories. Thus the Swi&s;s, after having &s;tripped Sigi&s;mond of all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in their country, &s;tipulated with him, to &s;upport his right to tho&s;e very provinces, which he had mortgaged in order to &s;trengthen his arms again&s;t them&s;elves: and Sigi&s;mond was under the mortifying nece&s;&s;ity of accepting the guarantee of the mo&s;t inveterate enemies of his family.</P>
<P>This treaty, which entirely changed the de&s;igns and altered the policy of the Swi&s;s republics, was &s;olely brought about by the artful intrigues of Louis XI.; and the jealou&s;y of that de&s;igning monarch turned into another channel the va&s;t pre|parations of the duke of Burgundy: pre|parations which would probably have been attended with more &s;ucce&s;s, had they been directed again&s;t France.</P>
<P>Charles perceived, when it was too late, the imprudence of his behaviour towards the Swi&s;s republics; and he now tried every method to engage them in a neu|trality: but they rejected his propo&s;als of reconciliation with firmne&s;s; prepared for
<PB N="370" REF="380">
a war, which now appeared inevitable, with their u&s;ual vigour; and even ad|vanced the 80,000 florins to Sigi&s;mond, who demanded the re&s;titution of his lands, and which the duke of Burgundy evaded under various pretexts. The latter hav|ing concluded a &s;eparate peace with Louis (who generally duped every &s;tate, with which he entered into alliance, and kept the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties no longer than they were &s;ub&s;ervient to his own intere&s;t) entered Swi&s;&s;erland with an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men; and, laying &s;iege to Grand|&s;on, carried it by a&s;&s;ault. But his &s;uc|ce&s;s ended here: for, at the &s;ub&s;equent battles of Grand&s;on and Morat, he was totally defeated, and his attempts upon Swi&s;&s;erland entirely foiled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Charles entered Swi&s;&s;erland confident of &s;ub|duing that country. The effect which this unex|pected and humiliating di&s;appointment had upon his &s;pirits and con&s;titution, is related by Philip de Co|mines, with his u&s;ual minutene&s;s, in his Memoirs addre&s;&s;ed to Angelo Cattho, archbi&s;hop of Vienne in Dauphin&eacute;. His account is curious, and will give &s;ome idea of the violent and impetuous cha|racter of Charles:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"His concern and di&s;traction for his fir&s;t defeat at Grand&s;on was &s;o great, and made &s;uch deep im|pre&s;&s;ion on his &s;pirits, that it threw him into a violent and dangerous fit of &s;ickne&s;s: for, whereas before, his choler and natural heat was &s;o great, that he drank no wine, only in the morning he took a little ti&s;ane, &s;weetened with con&s;erve of ro&s;es, to refre&s;h him&s;elf; this &s;udden melancholy had &s;o altered his con&s;titution, he was now forced to drink the &s;tronge&s;t wine that could be got, without any water. And, in order to draw the blood from his heart, &s;ome burning tow was put into the cupping-gla&s;&s;es, and applied to his &s;ide. But this, my lord of Vienne, you know better than I; for, your lord&s;hip attended on him during the whole cour&s;e of his illne&s;s, and &s;pared no pains that might contribute to his re|covery: and it was by your per&s;ua&s;ion that the duke was prevailed upon to cut his beard, which was of a prodigious length.

<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the immediate advantages to the Swi&s;s, by the death of the duke of Burgundy, were in them&s;elves unimportant; yet the con&s;equences of it operated very con&s;iderably on their future politics.

By this marriage, the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria acquired the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Low-Countries; and having fre|quent di&s;putes to &s;ettle with France, re|lating to tho&s;e territories which border upon that kingdom; the alliance of the

Swi&s;s was &s;trenuou&s;ly courted by both parties. And thus this country, being &s;ecured from all enterpri&s;es from with|out; acceded as occa&s;ion offered to the two rival powers; a&s;&s;i&s;ting each party by turns, as the intrigues, or rather as the &s;ub&s;idies, of the one or the other pre|vailed.</P>
<P>The&s;e intrigues gave ri&s;e to different alliances, contracted with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, the kings of France, the pope, and the dukes of Savoy and Milan.&mdash;But, not to enter more minutely into their hi&s;tory, I will only ob&s;erve in ge|neral, that hitherto the Swi&s;s had acted with great di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s in all their treaties, and had never taken the field but either to &s;ecure their liberties, or to drive their enemies out of Swi&s;&s;erland. It was about the period of the Burgun|dian war, that the &s;ub&s;idies which they obtained from Louis XI. taught them the di&s;graceful arts of mercenary poli|tics; as the rich plunder which they took from the duke of Burgundy gave, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the fir&s;t taint to that wonderful &s;implicity of manners, for which they had before been &s;o happily

<P>THERE is &s;carcely any antient town that has occa&s;ioned more controver&s;y among antiquarians, or that has given ri&s;e to &s;uch variety of con|jectures concerning its original and im|portance, as Avenches, the principal burgh of a bailliage in the Pays de Vaud. Some contend that it was the capital of all Helvetia; becau&s;e Tacitus calls it <HI>Aventicum gentis caput:</HI> while others have endeavoured to prove, that by this ex|pre&s;&s;ion the hi&s;torian meant only to de|note the capital town of its particular <HI>pagus</HI> or di&s;trict. Agreeably to &s;ome accounts, the city was built, and a Ro|man colony founded there, by Ve&s;pa|&s;ian: according to others (and with more probability) it was only repaired and beautified by that emperor, after it had
<PB N="376" REF="386">
been laid wa&s;te and almo&s;t ruined, by Vitellius.</P>
<P>Without entering however into di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions of this dry and unintere&s;ting kind, this much at lea&s;t is certain; that it was formerly a very con&s;iderable town, and under the dominion of the Romans. This appears not only from &s;everal mile|&s;tones, found in many parts of the Pays de Vaud, mo&s;t of which are numbered from <HI>Aventicum,</HI> as the principal place of reference; and al&s;o from various other in&s;criptions; but more particu|larly from the ruins &s;till exi&s;ting. I &s;hall &s;lightly mention a few of the latter, merely to &s;hew you it is not without evidence that the&s;e good people boa&s;t of their antiquity.</P>
<P>We traced the ruins of the antient walls, which appear to have enclo&s;ed a &s;pace near five miles in circumference. The pre&s;ent town occupies but a very incon&s;iderable part of this ground; the remainder is covered with corn-fields and meadows. One of the antient towers &s;till exi&s;ts: it is a &s;emicircular building, with the convex &s;ide turned towards the town.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="387">
We were &s;hewn a very curious mo|&s;aic pavement, di&s;covered &s;ome years ago in ploughing up a field. It is now in|clo&s;ed by a barn, which being let to &s;ome pea&s;ants, the ignorant occupiers are taking the mo&s;t effectual method to de&s;troy this elegant piece of antiquity as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. We found it &s;trew|ed all over with tobacco-plants: and indeed they not only cover it with damp herbs, which deaden the colours and rot the pavement; but &s;uffer every per&s;on who enters to take away bits. Even the Me&s;&s;rs. of Berne were &s;o in|&s;en&s;ible of the value of this admirable relic of antient genius, that they per|mitted the count of Caylus to take up one of the pannels; upon which the fi|gures of two &s;atyrs, repre&s;ented as em|bracing, were greatly admired for the exqui&s;ite beauty of the execution. The count de&s;igned to have conveyed them to Paris, but was di&s;appointed: for, by the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the per&s;ons employ|ed in removing them, the pannel was broken to pieces.</P>
<P>This fine mo&s;aic was the floor of an antient bath, and is about &s;ixty feet in
<PB N="378" REF="388">
length and forty in breadth: the ge|neral form is perfect; and, although &s;e|veral parts are broken off and lo&s;t, yet from what remains we could ea&s;ily trace the configuration of the whole.</P>
<P>The pavement con&s;i&s;ts of three ge|neral compartments: tho&s;e at each ex|tremity are regularly divided into fifteen octagons, eight &s;mall &s;quares, and &s;ix|teen &s;mall triangles. Five of the&s;e oc|tagons in each compartment, repre&s;ent|ed human figures in various attitudes, but chiefly Bacchanalian men and wo|men: the remaining octagons were com|po&s;ed of three different patterns, an|&s;wering to each other with great exact|ne&s;s. The vacant parts between the octagons are filled with the &s;mall &s;quares; and towards the outward border, with the &s;mall triangles above-mentioned. The middle compartment is divided into oblong pannels; in the large&s;t of which is an octagon bath of white marble, of about &s;ix feet in diameter, and a foot and an half deep: the &s;ides of the bath are ornamented with dolphins. Of the&s;e three compartments one is almo&s;t per|fect; the two others are very much de|faced.
<PB N="379" REF="389">
Each of the pannels are encir|cled with &s;everal borders prettily diver|&s;ified; and a general border enclo&s;es the whole.</P>
<P>Schmidt, in his <HI>Recueil d' Antiquit&eacute;s de la Sui&s;&s;e,</HI> ingeniou&s;ly conjectures, from a <HI>glory</HI> which encircles a head of Bac|chus in this mo&s;aic, that it was wrought during &s;ome part of the intervening age between Ve&s;pa&s;ian and Marcus Aurelius; becau&s;e that mark of divinity is never &s;een upon any monuments of Roman antiquity prior to that period. He adds, that the &s;ame kind of <HI>glory</HI> is ob&s;erved up|on the head of Trajan in an antient paint|ing at Rome; upon that of Antoninus Pius on a medal; and on the arch of Con&s;tantine. He &s;trengthens this con|jecture, by farther remarking, that the head-dre&s;s of one of the Bacchanalian women repre&s;ented in this mo&s;aic, re|&s;embles the head-dre&s;s on the medals of the empre&s;&s;es Plotina and Sabina<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The curious reader will find in the <HI>Recueil</HI> cited in the text, a very accurate de&s;cription and engrav|ing of this mo&s;aic.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From thence we were conducted to the ruins of an antient amphitheatre,
<PB N="380" REF="390">
within the walls of the bailiff's garden. The general form and &s;ize of this build|ing remain tolerably perfect, as al&s;o &s;ome parts of the walls which enclo&s;ed it. The diameter of the arena might be about eighty yards, as far as we could judge by pacing it; which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in|deed have been a very uncertain e&s;timate: for, one of the former bailiffs filled up the hollow with a con&s;iderable quantity of earth, in order to plant it with fruit|trees; wi&s;ely conceiving, I &s;uppo&s;e, that to have good fruit was of more value, than to be able to determine the preci&s;e extent of all the antient amphitheatres that ever exi&s;ted. Under a tower (part of which is built of Roman materials) is a cell of about 24 feet by eighteen, and nearly 20 in heighth, from whence the animals were probably let loo&s;e upon the combatants. On the out&s;ide are &s;till to be &s;een the remains of five dens: and all over the walls, which are formed of brick and mortar, there are &s;everal pieces of rude &s;culpture con&s;iderably defaced.</P>
<P>Not far from the&s;e ruins &s;tands a large column of white marble, about 50 feet in heighth, compo&s;ed of immen&s;e
<PB N="381" REF="391">
ma&s;&s;es, nicely joined together without ce|ment; and near it lies &s;cattered a con|&s;iderable fragment of defaced &s;culpture: it has much the appearance of having been once the portal of &s;ome magnificent temple. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from this column, in the high road, we ob&s;erved a cornice, con&s;i&s;ting of a large &s;olid block of white marble, which probably belong|ed to the &s;ame building: the &s;culpture, which is not without merit, repre&s;ents urns and griffins. As we walked through the town, we remarked &s;everal other enormous ma&s;&s;es of cornice, ornamented with &s;ea-hor&s;es and urns; as al&s;o &s;ome marble columns of beautiful proportions.</P>
<P>About a mile from Avenches, near the village of Coppet, are the remains of a &s;mall aqueduct: it is on the other &s;ide of a little &s;tream, which &s;eparates the canton of Fribourg from that of Berne. It was di&s;covered about fifteen years ago, by the accidental falling of a hill of &s;and which covered the aque|duct, and in its fall demoli&s;hed a part of it. The out&s;ide is formed of &s;tones and mortar, and the in&s;ide of a red cement, as hard as the old Roman tile:
<PB N="382" REF="392">
the vault of the arch may be about two feet and an half high, and one and an half broad. This aqueduct has been traced to the ea&s;t-&s;ide of the town, and al&s;o to near the high marble co|lumn before mentioned. We were in|formed that it extends to the tower of Gau&s;a, between Vevay and Lau&s;anne; and that between Villar&s;el and Mar|naw, about four leagues from Cop|pet, the &s;olid rock is cut through in an arch of nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ly the &s;ame dimen&s;ions. But whether the&s;e &s;everal parts actually com|municated with each other, or indeed whether they really exi&s;t; are facts which, (having only viewed tho&s;e re|mains that are vi&s;ible near this town) I mu&s;t be contented to re&s;t on the credit of my informers.</P>

<P>THE town of Fribourg was built in 1179, by Berchtold IV. duke of Zaeringen, who endowed it with con&s;ider|able
<PB N="383" REF="393">
privileges. Upon the extinction of the male line of the hou&s;e of Zaeringen, in 1218<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hou&s;e of Zaeringen was de&s;cended from the antient counts of Al&s;ace, by Berchtold count of Bri&s;gaw. His grand&s;on, Berchtold II, built the ca&s;tle of Zaeringen; from which Berchtold III. took the title of duke. That ca&s;tle was &s;itu|ated near a village of the &s;ame name, not far from the pre&s;ent town of Freyburg, capital of the Bri&s;gaw. Berchtold V, the la&s;t duke, was cho&s;en emperor in 1198, in oppo&s;ition to the hou&s;e of Sua|bia; but re&s;igned in favour of Philip. Upon his death his territories were divided between his col|lateral heirs, the dukes of Teck, and his two &s;i&s;ters Agnes and Anne. The former married Egeno, count of Urach; by which marriage he obtained po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Freyburg in the Bri&s;gaw; and his po&s;terity were called counts of Freyburg. Anne married Ulric, count of Kybourg: their daughter Hedwige, was wife of Albert count of Hab&s;bourg, and mo|ther of the emperor Rodolph I.</NOTE>, Ulric of Kybourg obtained the &s;overeignty of the town, in right of his wife Anne, &s;i&s;ter of the la&s;t duke Berch|told V. It came by marriage into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Eberhard count of Hab&s;|bourg-Lauffenbourg; who &s;old it to his cou&s;in Rhodolph of Hab&s;bourg, af|terwards emperor, and founder of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. During this period a continual rival&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between
<PB N="384" REF="394">
Berne and Fribourg, they were fre|quently engaged in mutual ho&s;tilities: at length, however, all differences were compo&s;ed; and the two cities, in 1403, entered into a perpetual alliance.</P>
<P>Fribourg continued under the domi|nion of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and was a party in all the quarrels in which that family were engaged with the Swi&s;s republics, until the middle of the fif|teenth century; when, by a very &s;in|gular revolution, it renounced all alle|giance to Albert archduke of Au&s;tria, and brother to the emperor Frederic III; and put it&s;elf under the protection of the duke of Savoy. From this aera it occa|&s;ionally a&s;&s;i&s;ted the cantons again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and in the war be|tween the Swi&s;s and Charles the Bold, the troops of this republic had a &s;hare in the victories of Grand&s;on and Morat. Soon after the la&s;t of the&s;e battles, the hou&s;e of Savoy, at the interce&s;&s;ion of Berne, renounced all right and title to the town of Fribourg. By this means &s;he became a free and independent republic; and, in 1481, was admitted, together with Soleure, a member of the Helvetic confederacy.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="395">
The government of Fribourg is entirely ari&s;tocratical, the &s;overeign and legi&s;lative authority being ve&s;ted in the great coun|cil, con&s;i&s;ting of 200; the members of which are cho&s;en by that council, and from a few patrician families. The little council of 24, in which re&s;ides the execu|tive power; and the &s;ecret council, con|&s;i&s;ting of 60 members; are &s;ub-divi&s;ions of the great council. I &s;hall not enter into a minute detail of this government; which re&s;embles (&s;ome incon&s;iderable dif|ferences excepted) the other ari&s;tocratical &s;tates of Swi&s;&s;erland. The mo&s;t remark|able circum&s;tance that di&s;tingui&s;hes it, is the mode of electing the members of the &s;ecret and of the little council. The names of the candidates are placed privately in a box, containing as many divi&s;ions as there are per&s;ons who &s;olicit the charge. Into each of the&s;e partitions the &s;uffrages are thrown; and the &s;everal electors put in their ballots, as chance directs, without knowing to which of the candidates they may happen to give their vote: and he who has the mo&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;ual ballots is cho&s;en. This method has the appear|ance of effectually guarding again&s;t fa|mily
<PB N="386" REF="396">
influence: neverthele&s;s, if it be con|&s;idered, that the candidate can only be taken from certain families, and under cer|tain re&s;trictions; it may well be que&s;tion|ed, whether it &s;ufficiently an&s;wers the purpo&s;e for which it was intended.</P>
<P>This canton is entirely catholic. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain above 60,000 &s;ouls, without including the town; in which there are about 6,000. Its territory con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of excellent pa&s;ture; produces &s;ome corn, and but little wine. The commerce here is too incon&s;ider|able to be mentioned: and literature is by no means in a more flouri&s;hing &s;tate. The town &s;tands on a hill in a very &s;ingular &s;ituation, half encircled by the river Sane; the banks whereof are formed by naked perpendicular rocks; but the adjacent country exhibits a beau|tiful variegated &s;cene of ri&s;ing grounds, rich meadows, and fine fore&s;ts.</P>
<P>This republic draws con&s;iderable &s;ub|&s;idies from France, both in money and &s;alt; and it is computed that, in pro|portion to its &s;ize, none of the other cantons have &s;o many troops in that &s;ervice. It has long been a controverted
<PB N="387" REF="397">
que&s;tion, whether Swi&s;&s;erland gains or lo&s;es by furni&s;hing &s;uch numbers of her natives to &s;erve in foreign armies. That the fidelity of the&s;e troops is &s;o well recogni&s;ed, as to be cho&s;en above all others to be the life-guards of &s;everal &s;overeigns; is a circum&s;tance, which in that re&s;pect, undoubtedly, redounds much to the honour of the national character of the Swi&s;s: but, on the other hand, to traffic with the blood of their &s;ub|jects, and let them out, for paltry &s;ub|&s;idies, to fight the battles of any king, in any cau&s;e; &s;eems to betray a merce|nary &s;pirit, uncontrouled by con&s;idera|tions of ju&s;tice and humanity. It has been urged, that were it not for their furni&s;hing the&s;e &s;upplies to foreign na|tions, Swi&s;&s;erland would be over-&s;tocked with inhabitants; and that the people would be obliged, like the northern hives of old, to emigrate for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: for, in many parts there is no commerce; and the mountainous tracts of this country cannot &s;upply &s;ufficient provi&s;ion for &s;uch a numerous people. In reply to this rea|&s;oning, it may be alledged, that they do not make u&s;e of all the re&s;ources in their
<PB N="388" REF="398">
power: commerce might be more gene|rally cultivated and encouraged; as there is no part of Swi&s;&s;erland which is far re|moved from &s;ome of the principal rivers and great lakes, all of which have a di|rect communication with the &s;ea.</P>
<P>But, to be convinced that they have not exhau&s;ted all the advantages to which they might re&s;ort; let them look back on antient Greece, and the immen&s;e popu|lou&s;ne&s;s in &s;o confined a country; or, what is more open to their ob&s;ervation, let them con&s;ider the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the United Provinces, and the abundance tho&s;e indu&s;trious people enjoy on a tract of land &s;natched from an element perpetu|ally reclaiming its prior occupancy. But the Swi&s;s need not be &s;ent to antient or foreign nations for examples: they have them much nearer home. Geneva and St. Gallen are, for their extent, exceed|ingly populous; and yet the natural pro|ductions of their lands are by no means &s;ufficient to &s;upport all the inhabitants. Appenzel is entirely mountainous, as well as the di&s;trict of Vallengin, neverthele&s;s both tho&s;e countries are remarkably well peopled; and they derive from the neigh|bouring
<PB N="389" REF="399">
nations, by means of their com|merce and indu&s;try, all the nece&s;&s;aries of life in great abundance. Indeed Swi&s;&s;er|land is &s;o far from being over-&s;tocked with people, that in mo&s;t of the great towns there is a manife&s;t want of inha|bitants. Nor is this depopulation con|fined to the towns alone: for, &s;everal parts of this country, and more particularly the Pays de Vaud, are con&s;iderably le&s;s peopled than they were in the la&s;t cen|tury; in&s;omuch that hands are frequently wanting for the common purpo&s;es of agriculture.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections &s;eem to prove the mi&s;taken policy of Swi&s;&s;erland, in letting out her troops to foreign &s;tates: but the evil is too deeply rooted to admit of a &s;peedy cure. Individuals, it is true, make fortunes by this kind of traffic, but the public &s;uffers. Some circum&s;tances, how|ever, may be remarked in its favour; as by this practice the &s;everal cantons not only have in con&s;tant re&s;erve, without the lea&s;t expence, a body of well-di&s;ci|plined forces, which they can recall at a moment's warning; but it becomes the intere&s;t, for that rea&s;on, of tho&s;e foreign
<PB N="390" REF="400">
powers, whom they furni&s;h with the&s;e troops, not to foment any divi&s;ions among the United States, which might render the pre&s;ence of their troops nece&s;&s;ary at home. Add to this, that the privileges which the Swi&s;s enjoy in France, and the very advantageous articles, relating to com|merce, &s;ecured to them in all their trea|ties, &s;eem to &s;trengthen the argument for continuing their connections of this kind with that kingdom.&mdash;Having thus &s;tated the principal topics, which are urged by the oppo&s;ite partizans of this contro|verted que&s;tion; I will leave you to de|termine on which &s;ide the balance pre|vails.</P>
<P>We are now at the &s;mall village of Neuneck, in our way to Berne: we made a little circuit to this place, in order to &s;ee an hermitage, that lies about a league from the town of Fribourg; and which has been much talked of, on account of the &s;ingularity of its con&s;truction. It is formed in the &s;olid rock; and the chief curio&s;ity con&s;i&s;ts in its having been the work of two men: as &s;uch, it is an a&s;to|ni&s;hing performance, but, in any other re&s;pect, it is hardly worth vi&s;iting. In
<PB N="391" REF="401">
the la&s;t century an hermit &s;cooped out a hollow in this rock, ju&s;t &s;ufficient for him to lie at his full length: but his &s;ucce&s;&s;or de&s;iring a more commodious man&s;ion, hewed, in the heart of the mountain, a chapel, &s;everal apartments, &s;tair-ca&s;es, &amp;c. The length of the whole is above 400 feet. One room is 90 feet long, and 20 broad; the &s;teeple of the chapel, if it may be &s;o called, is So feet high, and the chimney of the kitchen 90. The hermit who perforated this dwelling in the rock, was near thirty years at the work. What a wretched wa&s;te of time and indu&s;try! But &s;uch is the folly of &s;eque&s;tered &s;uper&s;tition, that, for want of better occupations to employ the mind, it frequently has re|cour&s;e to laborious trifles. The &s;itua|tion of this hermitage is beautiful: the rock in which it is cut, hangs over the river Sane, which meandring through two chains of hills covered with wood, fills up all the valley beneath. The pre&s;ent hermit is a German; and with him lives an old &s;oldier, his friend.</P>
<P>From this hermitage to Neuneck (at which place the canton of Berne com|mences)
<PB N="392" REF="402">
the country is rich, and finely wooded: on our right we had a di&s;|tant but &s;ublime view of a range of rude rocks, with &s;ome glaciers ri&s;ing above them and clo&s;ing the pro&s;pect. The &s;un was now going down: the va|rious tints of the evening&mdash;the purple gleam upon the naked rocks&mdash;and the rays of the &s;etting-&s;un upon the glaciers, which &s;eemed to glow almo&s;t into tran&s;|parency&mdash;ca&s;t &s;uch a mild and beauti|ful radiance over this magnificent &s;cene, as even the luminous pencil of that celebrated Grecian arti&s;t, who is &s;aid to have painted <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"quae pingi non po&s;&s;unt, fulgura &amp; fulgetra,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Apelles, vid.

<P>FROM the fir&s;t formation of the Hel|vetic union, additional cantons were from time to time admitted into it, until at length the reception of Appenzel finally clo&s;ed the confederacy. During the&s;e in|tervals, &s;everal of tho&s;e republics, which
<PB N="393" REF="403">
afterwards became members of the gene|ral league, were only allies of &s;ome of the particular cantons; enjoying the &s;ame privileges, and &s;tanding in the &s;ame rela|tion, as the pre&s;ent allies and a&s;&s;ociates of the United States. Among the&s;e, Fri|bourg and Soleure, having, upon the con|clu&s;ion of the war with Charles the Bold, entered into an alliance with Zuric, Berne, and Lucerne; demanded to be admitted into the Helvetic union. This alliance was con&s;idered by the five other combined cantons, as a breach of their antient treaty: accordingly they refu&s;ed to receive them. The di&s;pute grew warm; ho&s;tilities were upon the point of breaking out; when a native of the canton of Underwalden &s;ingly effected a reconciliation, and &s;aved his country from all the impending hor|rors of a civil war.</P>

<P>After having given a de&s;cription of the Helvetic union, he concludes the relation as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"So far are they (the thirteen cantons) from mak|ing one body or one commonwealth, that only the three old cantons are directly allied with every one of the other twelve.

<P>The above-cited account of the Helvetic union, would better have &s;uited the league of the eight can|tons before the convention of Stantz; when the con|federate &s;tates were not &s;o ab&s;olutely and directly united together as they are at pre&s;ent; and their alliance did not perhaps totally exclude every treaty of the &s;ame kind with other powers. It was only by the articles of that celebrated convention, and the alli|ance of the eight cantons with Fribourg and Soleure, that the union became ab&s;olutely fixed and general. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, however, that &s;everal Swi&s;s hi&s;to|rians have given the &s;ame idea of the Helvetic union as that above-mentioned: and that even now, authors differ con&s;iderably upon &s;ome important articles of the league.</P></NOTE> whole confe|derate

body; and in ca&s;e of war, the &s;e|veral forces to be &s;upplied by each canton are preci&s;ely &s;pecified. It appears how|ever, from the &s;tipulations to which the five later cantons agreed, that they do not, in every re&s;pect, enjoy equal prero|gatives with the eight antient ones. For, the latter re&s;erved to them&s;elves a right, in ca&s;e the que&s;tion for declaring war a|gain&s;t any foreign &s;tate, &s;hould be <HI>unani|mou&s;ly</HI> carried in their a&s;&s;embly, to re|quire the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other cantons,

without a&s;&s;igning the motive of &s;uch their re&s;olution: whereas the former, cannot commence ho&s;tilities without the con|&s;ent of the confederates; and if the ene|my &s;hould be willing to enter into a ne|gotiation concerning the matter in di&s;pute, it mu&s;t be referred to the arbitration of the eight antient cantons. It is farther &s;tipulated, that if a war &s;hould break out between the la&s;t-mentioned cantons, the others are to ob&s;erve a &s;trict neutrality.</P>
<P>The next e&s;&s;ential object of the league, is, to pre&s;erve peace and good order a|mong the &s;everal cantons. It is there|fore covenanted, that all public di&s;cords of this nature &s;hall be finally &s;ettled be|tween the contending parties in an ami|cable manner: and for this purpo&s;e par|ticular judges and arbiters are expre&s;ly appointed, and empowered to compo&s;e the di&s;&s;en&s;ions that may happen to ari&s;e. To this is added a reciprocal guarantee of the forms of government e&s;tabli&s;hed in the re&s;pective commonwealths: for by the convention of Stantz it was agreed, in order to prevent internal factions and revolts in any of the al|lied cantons, that, in ca&s;e of rebellion,
<PB N="400" REF="410">
the magi&s;tracy of &s;uch canton &s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the forces of the others. Ac|cordingly, the hi&s;tory of Swi&s;&s;erland af|fords many in&s;tances of protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance reciprocally given between the confederates, in defence and &s;upport of the con&s;titution of particular cantons.</P>
<P>No &s;eparate engagement what&s;oever, which any of the cantons may enter into, can be valid, if incon&s;i&s;tent with the fundamental articles of this general union: or in other words, the recipro|cal contract between the members of the league, &s;uper&s;edes every other &s;pecies of public obligation. With the foregoing exceptions, the &s;everal combined &s;tates are di&s;tinct from, and independent of, each other: they may contract alliances with any power, or reject the &s;ame, al|though all the others have acceded to it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The five cantons which agreed not to conclude any treaty without the con&s;ent of the eight, are ne|ce&s;&s;arily excluded from this power, together with tho&s;e particular cantons, which have bound them|&s;elves by private treaties not to contract any foreign alliance, without the reciprocal con&s;ent of the others; as for in&s;tance, Uri, Schweitz, and Under|walden, by the alliance at Brunnen in 1715. But this depends upon particular treaties, and has no relation to the general union. In fact, every can|ton is re&s;trained by the general articles of the Hel|vetic union: but, conforming to tho&s;e, no one re|public is controuled by the re&s;olutions of the ma|jority of the confederate cantons, in any other in|&s;tance what&s;oever.</NOTE>; may grant auxiliary troops to fo|reign

<P>The public affairs of the Helvetic bo|dy and their allies are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and de|termined in the &s;everal diets: and the&s;e are,</P>

<P>The ordinary meetings of the <HI>general</HI> diet are held once a year, and continue &s;itting one month; the extraordinary ones are &s;ummoned upon particular oc|ca&s;ions. This diet is principally con|vened to deliberate upon the be&s;t mea|&s;ures for the &s;ecurity of the Helvetic bo|dy.

(when the five latter renounced the co|regency of Baden) the diets have been holden at Frauenfield in Thurgaw. Each canton &s;ends as many deputies as it thinks proper.</P>

Suffer me only to remark in general, that the allies may be divided into a&s;&s;ociate, and into confederate &s;tates: of the former, are the abbot and town of St. Gallen, the towns of Bienne and Mulhau&s;en: of the latter, are the Gri|&s;ons, and the republic of the Vallais; the town and republic of Geneva; the principality of Neuchatel, and the bi&s;hop of Ba&s;il.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Berne, <DATE>Sept. 16.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Was very much &s;truck, upon my en|trance into Berne, with its &s;ingular neatne&s;s and beauty: I do not remember to have &s;een any town (Bath alone ex|cepted) the fir&s;t appearance whereof had &s;o plea&s;ing an effect. The principal &s;treet is broad and long: the hou&s;es are mo&s;tly uniform, built of a greyi&s;h &s;tone upon arcades, which are admirably well paved. Through the middle of the &s;treet runs a lively &s;tream of the cleare&s;t water, in a channel con&s;tructed for its reception: but be&s;ides this &s;tream, it abounds with foun|tains not le&s;s ornamental to the place than beneficial to the inhabitants. The river Aar flows clo&s;e by the town, and indeed almo&s;t &s;urrounds it; winding its &s;erpentine cour&s;e over a rocky bottom much below the level of the &s;treets; and for a con&s;iderable way forming by its banks, which are very &s;teep and craggy, a kind of natural rampart. The cathe|dral church is a noble piece of Gothic architecture: it &s;tands upon a platform
<PB N="406" REF="416">
that has been rai&s;ed at a great expence from the bed of the river; and which commands as fine a view as any I have &s;een in Swi&s;&s;erland.</P>
<P>The country around is richly culti|vated, and agreeably diver&s;ified with hills, lawns, wood, and water; the river flows rapidly below, and an abrupt chain of high and rugged alps appear at &s;ome di&s;|tance, who&s;e tops are covered with eter|nal &s;now. Such an a&s;&s;emblage of beauti|ful objects would in any view pre&s;ent a mo&s;t &s;triking pro&s;pect; but its effect be|comes greatly heightened when &s;een from the mid&s;t of a large town.</P>
<P>All the public buildings are in a mo&s;t noble &s;implicity of &s;tyle, and announce the riches and grandeur of the republic. The ar&s;enal contains arms for &s;ixty thou|&s;and men, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable quan|tity of cannon, which were ca&s;t here. The granary is an excellent in&s;titution, &s;imilar to that of Zuric; but it differs from that of Geneva, as the expence does not fall chiefly upon the poor: for, the bakers are not compelled by government to purcha&s;e their corn from the public magazine. This re&s;ervoir, if I may be
<PB N="407" REF="417">
allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, always contains a large provi&s;ion of that commodity; which is &s;upplied, in con&s;equence of particular agreements for that purpo&s;e, by France, Sardinia, and Holland; and out of which they partly furni&s;h Geneva, Neuchatel, and Ba&s;il. The ho&s;pitals, which are large, airy, and well built, are excellently re|gulated, both with re&s;pect to the care and attention paid to the &s;ick, and to the cleanline&s;s of the &s;everal wards. The town is kept neat by a number of felons, who are &s;entenced to this drudgery dur|ing a certain time, according to the na|ture of their offences; and, as capital con|demnations are very rare, this is the mo&s;t u&s;ual manner of puni&s;hing their criminals. The&s;e culprits are di&s;tingui&s;hed by an iron collar, with a hook projecting over their heads.</P>
<P>The library is a &s;mall but well-cho&s;en collection, and contains &s;ome very cu|rious manu&s;cripts: of the&s;e, Mr. Sinner, a man of great erudition, has publi&s;hed a very &s;atisfactory and judicious cata|logue. He has not only &s;et forth their titles, and a&s;certained their age, but has al&s;o given a general and &s;uccinct account of their re&s;pective &s;ubjects; and from ma|ny
<PB N="408" REF="418">
of them has publi&s;hed extracts equally curious and intere&s;ting. Among the&s;e MSS. are &s;ome of the thirteenth century, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal &s;ongs and romances, of the Troubadours, written in that and the preceding ages, which merit the at|tention of tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant in that &s;pecies of antient poetry.</P>
<P>I have been much di&s;appointed in not &s;eeing the great Haller: his very infirm &s;tate of health would not admit of his receiv|ing a vi&s;it from us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He died the beginning of the pre&s;ent year 1778.</NOTE>. I need not tell you how eminently that celebrated author has di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in every &s;pecies of polite literature, and in &s;everal branches of natural philo&s;ophy. Unlike certain mi|nute philo&s;ophers of the pre&s;ent age, who&s;e athei&s;tical and infidel writings are too well known and too widely di&s;&s;eminated; this great man is &s;o unfa&s;hionable as to have followed the &s;teps of a Locke and a Newton; and to have proved him&s;elf, both in his life and his writings, a zeal|ous friend and able advocate of chri&s;tia|nity. When literature and philo&s;ophy, in&s;tead of being employed, as they too often have been, in &s;upporting &s;ceptical
<PB N="409" REF="419">
tenets by artful &s;ophi&s;try, thus lend their joint a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the cau&s;e of re|ligion; it is then only that they become an honour to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and a benefit to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Learning is neither &s;o univer&s;ally en|couraged, nor &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated here as at Zuric; the academical &s;tudies are almo&s;t &s;olely directed to tho&s;e branches of knowledge more e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for entering into the church. The &s;ociety for the promotion of agriculture, is al|mo&s;t the only e&s;tabli&s;hment that directly tends to the progre&s;s of the arts and &s;ci|ences: and even this meets with no great countenance from government. There is but little commerce in the capital: &s;ome few manufactures indeed (chiefly of li|nen and &s;ilk) have been e&s;tabli&s;hed; but they are carried on by tho&s;e only who have no pro&s;pect of being admitted into the &s;overeign council. For tho&s;e fami|lies who have any influence in public af|fairs, would hold them&s;elves degraded, were they to engage in any branch of com|merce; and as offices of the &s;tate, ex|cept bailliages, are in general not very profitable, nor indeed numerous, many of
<PB N="410" REF="420">
them enter, as their &s;ole re&s;ource, into foreign armies. With re&s;pect to tho&s;e among them who have &s;ufficient intere&s;t to be cho&s;en into the &s;overeign council; as they mu&s;t have attained the full age of twenty-nine before they are eligible; and in the mean while, as very few of them apply their minds to literary pur|&s;uits; they u&s;ually, from mere want of em|ployment, wa&s;te the interval in an idle and di&s;&s;ipated cour&s;e of life. Neverthele&s;s, there are &s;everal members of the &s;overeign coun|cil, who are ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed for their political abilities: and, being thoroughly acquainted with the re&s;pective intere&s;ts of the different powers of Europe, they know perfectly well how to avail them|&s;elves of every conjuncture which may be turned to the advantage, or the glory, of their own republic.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Berne value them|&s;elves much upon their politene&s;s to &s;trangers: and indeed it is but doing them &s;trict ju&s;tice to acknowledge, that they have &s;hewn us (with that peculiar frankne&s;s and unaffected affability, I have &s;o often had occa&s;ion to admire in the Swi&s;s) every civility in their power.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="421">
According to the hi&s;torians of Berne, this town was built by Berchtold V, duke of Zaeringen; and was, from its foun|dation, an imperial city. Upon the death of the duke in 1218, the emperor Fre|deric II. conferred upon the inhabitants con&s;iderable privileges, and drew up al&s;o a code of legi&s;lation, which forms the ba&s;is of their pre&s;ent civil laws. The liberty which this town enjoyed, attracted great numbers of inhabitants from the adjacent country, who found here a &s;ure a&s;ylum from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the nobles. From its fir&s;t foundation, Berne was engaged in perpetual wars with its neighbours, and for &s;ome time with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria: notwith&s;tanding which, the town continued to aggrandi&s;e it&s;elf by degrees, and con&s;iderably to enlarge its territory. In the year 1352, Berne ac|ceded to the Helvetic confederacy; and &s;o great was its power, even at that early period, that it obtained the &s;econd rank after Zuric, among the allied &s;tates. Since the acqui&s;ition of the Pays de Vaud, the domains of this canton form nearly the third part of Swi&s;&s;erland, and about the fourth of its actual population: it contains about three hundred and fifty
<PB N="412" REF="422">
thou&s;and &s;ouls, be&s;ides about eleven thou|&s;and in the capital. By the introduction of the reformation into the town in 1528, the government acquired a large en|crea&s;e of its revenues, ari&s;ing from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which were very con&s;iderable. Not long after that pe|riod, the whole canton followed the ex|ample of the capital, and the reform|ed religion was univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout its exten&s;ive dominions.</P>
<P>The Pays de Vaud having been con|quered from the hou&s;e of Savoy, as the German divi&s;ion of the canton was from the &s;tates of the empire; ju&s;tice is ad|mini&s;tered, and the taxes regulated in tho&s;e two provinces by a &s;et of laws and cu&s;toms peculiar to each: for, they have re&s;pectively pre&s;erved the &s;everal di&s;tinct u&s;ages which were in force among them before they came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Berne. Each of the&s;e divi&s;ions has its trea&s;urer and its chamber of appeal, re&s;i|dent at Berne: the chamber of appeal be|longing to the Pays de Vaud, judges in the la&s;t re&s;ort; but the inhabitants of the German di&s;trict may again appeal from theirs to the &s;overeign council.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>WERE I to attempt entering into an exact di&s;qui&s;ition concerning the government of Berne; my letter would not only exceed its proper limits, but would hardly be contained within the extent of an ordinary pamphlet. I am per&s;uaded, therefore, you will readily ex|cu&s;e me from putting your patience to &s;o tedious a trial: but you would pro|bably think me very incon&s;i&s;tent indeed, if, after having already, in the cour&s;e of our corre&s;pondence, de&s;cended, too mi|nutely perhaps, into le&s;s intere&s;ting de|tails; I &s;hould totally pa&s;s over in &s;ilence a government, the wi&s;dom of who&s;e ad|mini&s;tration is &s;o generally and &s;o ju&s;tly admired. Let me endeavour then, &s;en|&s;ible as I am of my inability to treat the &s;ubject as it de&s;erves, to &s;ketch at lea&s;t the general outlines of this con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>The &s;overeign power re&s;ides in the great council of two hundred; which when compleat con&s;i&s;ts of 299 mem|bers. They are cho&s;en from the
<PB N="414" REF="424">
burghers of the town; from whom they are con&s;idered as deriving their power, and as acting by deputation. The au|thority with which they are inve&s;ted, is in &s;ome re&s;pects the mo&s;t ab&s;olute and uncontrouled of any of the ari&s;tocratical &s;tates of Swi&s;&s;erland. The government of Lucerne is called, indeed, the mo&s;t ari&s;tocratical of all the cantons; and it may be &s;o, perhaps, with re&s;pect to the &s;mall number of families, to which the admini&s;tration of affairs is entru&s;ted: but no war can be declared, no peace concluded, no alliance made, no taxes impo&s;ed, without the con&s;ent of their burghers in a general a&s;&s;embly. At Fri|bourg and Soleure the burghers are like|wi&s;e convened upon particular occa&s;ions. Whereas the &s;overeign council of Berne (and it is a peculiarity which di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all the other &s;imilar republics in the confederate cantons) is re&s;trained by no con&s;titutional check of this kind: as a general a&s;&s;embly of the burghers is never convened for any purpo&s;e what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The executive powers of government are delegated by the &s;overeign council to the
<PB N="415" REF="425">
&s;enate, or &s;maller council cho&s;en by them|&s;elves out of their own body: the former a&s;&s;embles ordinarily three times a week, and extraordinarily upon particular occa|&s;ions; the latter every day, Sundays ex|cepted.</P>
<P>The &s;enate, compri&s;ing the two advoy|ers, or chiefs of the republic, is com|po&s;ed of twenty-&s;even members: and from this &s;elect body are taken the prin|cipal magi&s;trates of the commonwealth. When a vacancy happens in this &s;enate, the mode of election is as follows:&mdash;Twenty-&s;ix balls, three of which are golden, are put into a box, and drawn by the &s;everal members: tho&s;e who draw the three golden ones, nominate three elec|tors out of their body. In the &s;ame manner of balloting, &s;even members are cho&s;en from the great council, who al&s;o nominate &s;even electors out of their own body. The&s;e ten electors fix upon a certain number of candidates, not ex|ceeding ten, nor le&s;s than &s;ix; and tho&s;e among the&s;e candidates, who have the fewe&s;t votes in the &s;overeign council, re|tire, till their number is reduced to four: then four balls, two golden and two &s;il|ver,
<PB N="416" REF="426">
are drawn by the four remaining can|didates; the two who draw the former are put in nomination, and he who has the greate&s;t number of &s;uffrages in the &s;overeign council, is cho&s;en. But in order to be eligible, the candidate mu&s;t have been a member of the great coun|cil ten years, and mu&s;t be married.</P>
<P>The &s;overeign council is generally filled up every ten years; as within that pe|riod there is u&s;ually a deficiency of eighty members to complete the whole number of two hundred and ninety-nine: and this council determines the time of elec|tion, by vote. That point being &s;ettled, each advoyer nominates two of the new members; each &s;eizenier, and each mem|ber of the &s;enate, one apiece: two or three other officers of &s;tate have likewi&s;e the &s;ame privilege. There is al&s;o a cer|tain number of per&s;ons who claim, by virtue of their offices, a right of being elected: and their claim is generally ad|mitted. The&s;e &s;everal nominations and preten&s;ions, commonly amount, in the whole, to about fifty of the new mem|bers: the remaining vacancies are filled up by the &s;uffrages of the &s;enate, and the &s;eizeniers.</P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="427">
The <HI>Seizeniers</HI> are &s;ixteen members of the great council, drawn yearly from the abbayes or tribes; two from each of the four great ones, and one from each of the remaining eight. The candidates are generally <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay <HI>generally,</HI> becau&s;e it is not ab&s;olutely fixed, that all the &s;eizeniers mu&s;t have been bailiffs: for if it happen, that in one tribe there are two per|&s;ons, one of whom has been a bailiff, and the other is a member of the great council; they draw lots for the charge. And &s;hould a member of the great council be the only one of his tribe, he becomes &s;eizenier of cour&s;e, provided he be eligible. In order to be &s;eizenier, the candidate mu&s;t be married, and have neither his father or brother in the &s;enate.</NOTE> taken from tho&s;e who have exerci&s;ed the office of bailiffs; and they are elected, not by a plurality of voices, but by lot. Every year during three days at Ea&s;ter, all other employments in the &s;tate are &s;uppo&s;ed to cea&s;e, except tho&s;e of the bannerets and the &s;eizeniers, who, during this &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, are inve&s;ted with a power &s;imilar to that of the Roman cen&s;ors; and in ca&s;e of mal-admini&s;tra|tion may deprive any member of the great council, or of the &s;enate, of his &s;eat: but it is a power which they never exer|ci&s;e. However, &s;hould they think pro|per
<PB N="418" REF="428">
to exert it, their &s;entence mu&s;t be confirmed by the &s;overeign council.</P>
<P>The principal magi&s;trates are, the two advoyers, the two trea&s;urers, and the four bannerets: they are each of them cho&s;en by a majority of voices in the &s;overeign council, and are yearly confirmed in their re&s;pective offices. The advoyers hold their po&s;t for life; the trea&s;urers, &s;ix years; and the bannerets, four. At Ea&s;ter the advoyer in office delivers up his authority, in full council, to his col|league. The <HI>reigning</HI> advoyer, as he is called, has a particular &s;eat a&s;&s;igned to him in the council-chamber, &s;omewhat elevated, under a canopy: the &s;eal of the republic lies upon the table before him. He never delivers his opinion except it is demanded; and he has no vote un|le&s;s the numbers are equal; and in that ca&s;e, he has the ca&s;ting voice. The ad|voyer out of office, is the fir&s;t &s;enator in rank, and pre&s;ident of the &s;ecret coun|cil.</P>
<P>The two trea&s;urers, one for the Ger|man di&s;trict, and the other for the Pays de Vaud, form, in conjunction with the four bannerets, an oeconomical chamber,
<PB N="419" REF="429">
or council of finances: this council exa|mines and pa&s;&s;es the accounts of the bailiffs, and receives the revenues of all others, that are accountable to govern|ment. The four bannerets, together with the advoyer out of office, as al&s;o the &s;enior trea&s;urer, and two members of the &s;enate, compo&s;e a committee or &s;ecret council; in which all &s;tate affairs, that require greater &s;ecrecy than is likely to be ob&s;erved in &s;o numerous a body as the &s;overeign council, are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: and they have the power of determining upon points of very con&s;iderable importance.</P>
<P>I have only de&s;cribed (and as conci&s;ely as I was able, con&s;i&s;tently with giving you a general idea of their nature) the&s;e eight magi&s;tracies, as being the chief offices of the &s;tate, and exerci&s;ed by members of the &s;enate. But notwith&s;tanding that the ge|neral form of this con&s;titution, is entirely ari&s;tocratical; and though the &s;enate po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a very con&s;iderable influence; yet it does not enjoy that almo&s;t exclu&s;ive au|thority, which is ob&s;ervable in the go|vernments of Lucerne, Fribourg, and So|leure. For, by &s;everal wi&s;e and well-ob|&s;erved regulations, the &s;overeign council,
<PB N="420" REF="430">
although it delegates the mo&s;t important concerns of government to the &s;enate, yet a&s;&s;embles, at &s;tated times, and &s;uperin|tends the admini&s;tration of public affairs. In &s;hort, the &s;overeign council of Berne con&s;tantly convene, and exerci&s;e their au|thority, independent of the &s;enate.</P>
<P>The admini&s;tration is carried on, throughout the &s;everal departments of government, with a wonderful preci&s;ion; and every ordinance is executed with as much di&s;patch as in a monarchical &s;tate. The ari&s;tocratical form is frequently, of all modes of government, the mo&s;t op|pre&s;&s;ive to the people; as, in&s;tead of one de&s;pot, they are liable to &s;uffer under the tyranny of many. But this objection will not hold with re&s;pect to Berne, or any other of the ari&s;tocratical &s;tates of Swi&s;|&s;erland: they are, each of them, ad|mini&s;tred with great wi&s;dom and mode|ration; and the re&s;pective rulers are par|ticularly cautious not to encroach upon the privileges of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The canton of Berne is divided into a certain number of di&s;tricts, called bail|liages; over which, bailiffs are cho&s;en from the &s;overeign council: and, as the&s;e
<PB N="421" REF="431">
are the mo&s;t profitable po&s;ts under the government, they are the great objects of general pur&s;uit. Formerly the bailiffs were elected by the majority of voices in the council; but as this method render|ed the members entirely dependent upon tho&s;e who had the chief credit and in|fluence in the commonwealth; a law pa&s;&s;ed in 1712, which altered the mode of election, and they are now cho&s;en by lot. No competitor however can be re|ceived as a candidate, in oppo&s;ition to one who has been longer a member of the &s;overeign council than him&s;elf: for in&s;tance, he who was admitted a mem|ber in 1766, cannot &s;tand again&s;t one who was cho&s;en in 1756. None but married men are capable of being elected into this office, nor can any per&s;on be cho&s;en more than once for the principal bailliages; tho&s;e of a le&s;s valuable kind may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed three times.</P>
<P>The &s;everal bailiffs are repre&s;entatives of the &s;overeign power in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts. Accordingly, they put in force the edicts of government; collect the public revenues; act as ju&s;tices of the peace; and are judges in civil and crimi|nal
<PB N="422" REF="432">
cau&s;es, except where there is any local juri&s;diction. However, in civil cau&s;es, beyond a certain value, an ap|peal lies to the courts of Berne: and in criminal ones, the proce&s;s, after it is made out in the bailiff's court, under|goes a revi&s;ion in the &s;enate, who re|fer it to the criminal chamber; and having received the report, pa&s;s &s;en|tence finally; unle&s;s in capital ca&s;es, when their &s;entence mu&s;t be con|firmed by the &s;overeign council. The bailiff delivers in his accounts to the oeconomical chamber, to which court an appeal lies, in ca&s;e of exaction, either on the part of the bailiff, or of his offi|cers: and with re&s;pect to tho&s;e mi&s;de|meanors that are puni&s;hable by fine, and of which the bailiff is entitled to a &s;hare; the quantum of the re&s;pective penalties is &s;ettled by the legi&s;lature, with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous exactne&s;s, and not left to the arbitrary deci&s;ion of an intere&s;ted judge.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e con&s;iderations it &s;hould &s;eem, that every po&s;&s;ible precaution has been taken by government to prevent the extortions of the bailiffs: but in&s;tances
<PB N="423" REF="433">
have not been wanting to prove, that the&s;e laws and regulations, wi&s;e and &s;trict as they are, may be eluded. Indeed there appears to be one circum&s;tance, which mu&s;t render appeals for redre&s;s again&s;t the exactions of the bailiffs (un|le&s;s of the mo&s;t notorious and flagrant kind) not always to be heard with impar|tiality; the council of two hundred, before whom the&s;e appeals are finally brought, con&s;i&s;ting of members, who either have been, who are, or who expect to be, bailiffs: and thus the judges are in &s;ome mea&s;ure intere&s;ted to &s;creen the offen|ders. It mu&s;t be acknowledged that this is one of the greate&s;t defects in the admi|ni&s;tration of ju&s;tice: neverthele&s;s, its ill con&s;equence in the government of Berne, has been much exaggerated by &s;ome wri|ters; as it is certain, that where bailiffs have been guilty of oppre&s;&s;ions, fre|quent examples occur of their being im|partially and &s;everely puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The profits of this office ari&s;e from a certain portion of the different taxes and duties, paid to government in the re|&s;pective bailliages. In the German divi|&s;ion
<PB N="424" REF="434">
of the canton, the bailiff is entitled, upon the death of every pea&s;ant, to a certain determinate part of the inheri|tance: his &s;hare, it is true, is very in|con&s;iderable; neverthele&s;s, in &s;ome &s;itua|tions it may prove a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and oppre&s;&s;ive tax upon the family. How|ever, this is the only in&s;tance I have met with, where the pea&s;ants are liable to any impo&s;ition, which can ju&s;tly be deemed grievous.</P>
<P>Sumptuary laws are in force through|out this canton; and the wearing of gold, &s;ilver, lace, &amp;c. and even of &s;ilk, is expre&s;sly prohibited. The <HI>chamber of reform,</HI> however, has found it nece&s;&s;ary, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, to relax the rigour of the&s;e laws. Indeed, the va&s;t &s;trides, which luxury has made within this century, is very perceivable throughout Swi&s;&s;er|land: and there is no place where its pro|gre&s;s has been more rapid than at Berne. The attention of government has not been wanting to re&s;train it; as appears by the laws that have repeatedly been en|acted for that purpo&s;e: an attention, however, which in many in&s;tances has not proved altogether as &s;ucce&s;sful, as it
<PB N="425" REF="435">
was well directed; notwith&s;tanding the &s;overeign council has given the &s;everal fines incurred by tho&s;e per&s;ons who tran&s;|gre&s;s the&s;e ordinances, to the members of the <HI>chamber of reform.</HI> In one re&s;pect, however, their laudable endeavours have been more effectual. Not long ago the &s;pirit of gaming had ari&s;en in Berne to &s;uch an extravagant heighth, as to have overwhelmed &s;everal families in total ruin. Upon this occa&s;ion the &s;overeign council interpo&s;ed its authority, by very &s;alutary regulations: and, in order to en|force the ob&s;ervance of them the more &s;trictly, every member of that council is obliged to take an oath, by which he &s;wears that he will inform again&s;t any tran&s;gre&s;&s;or that comes within his ob&s;er|vation. By this law all public games of hazard are expre&s;sly prohibited; and in other kind of games, the parties are re|&s;trained from playing for more than a certain &s;um particularly &s;pecified.</P>
<P>Although there are no &s;tanding armies in Swi&s;&s;erland, yet in many of the can|tons, and particularly in this, the militia is &s;o well regulated, that government could a&s;&s;emble a very con&s;iderable body
<PB N="426" REF="436">
of men at a moment's warning. To this end, every male towards the age of &s;ix|teen is enrolled in the militia; and about a third of the whole number are formed into particular regiments, compo&s;ed of fu|&s;ileers and electionaries; the former con|&s;i&s;ting of batchelors, and the latter of married men. Every per&s;on thus en|rolled, is obliged to provide him&s;elf, at his own expence, with an uniform, a mu&s;ket, and a certain quantity of powder and ball: and no pea&s;ant is allowed to marry, unle&s;s he produces his uniform and his arms. Every year a certain number of officers, who are called Land Majors, are deputed by the council of war, throughout the canton, to in&s;pect the arms of the &s;oldiers, to complete the regiments, and to exerci&s;e the militia: and upon their return they make their report to that council. Be&s;ides this annual review, the regiments are occa&s;ionally exerci&s;ed by particular veteran &s;oldiers, appointed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the arms which are kept in the ar&s;enal of Berne, there is al&s;o a cer|tain quantity in the ar&s;enal of each bail|liage, &s;ufficient for the militia of that
<PB N="427" REF="437">
di&s;trict; and likewi&s;e a &s;um of money amounting to three months pay, which is appropriated to the electionaries in ca&s;e of actual &s;ervice. The dragoons are cho|&s;en from the &s;ub&s;tantial framers; as each per&s;on is obliged to provide his own hor&s;e and accoutrements. In time of peace, the advoyer out of office, is pre&s;ident of the council of war; and a member of that council is commander of the militia of the Pays de Vaud; but in time of war a general in chief is nominated, who com|mands all the forces of the republic.</P>
<P>A certain number of regiments being thus always in readine&s;s, &s;ignals are fixed on the highe&s;t part of each bailliage, for the a&s;&s;embling of the militia at a particular place appointed for that purpo&s;e in each di&s;trict; and there they receive orders where to march.</P>
<P>Swelled as my letter already is to an immoderate &s;ize, and much more &s;o than I intended, yet I cannot forbear trying your patience a little longer, ju&s;t to men|tion an in&s;titution, which &s;trikes me as well for its &s;ingularity as for its utility: I mean what is called the <HI>exterior &s;tate.</HI> It is a model in miniature (if I may &s;o
<PB N="428" REF="438">
expre&s;s my&s;elf) of the &s;overeign council, and re&s;embles its prototype in every cir|cum&s;tance. This exterior &s;tate is com|po&s;ed of tho&s;e burghers, who have not at|tained the age requi&s;ite for entering into the council of two hundred: they a&s;&s;em|ble frequently, and go through all the regular forms of government. They have their great council, their &s;enate, their two advoyers, regent and non-regent, their trea&s;urers, their bannerets, their &s;ei|zeniers; in &s;hort, every magi&s;trate and officer of &s;tate which belong to the con|&s;titution; all of whom are cho&s;en in the u&s;ual manner, and with the accu&s;tomed ceremonies. The po&s;t of advoyer in this mimic community is &s;olicited with great a&s;&s;iduity, and &s;ometimes obtained at a con&s;iderable expence; as the &s;ucce&s;s|ful candidate is &s;ure of being admitted into the great council of two hundred, without any farther recommendation. This body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a certain number of bailliages, which con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal ruined ca&s;tles di&s;per&s;ed over the canton: it has al&s;o its common trea&s;ure, and its debts. In this latter article, however, it by no means re&s;embles the actual government of
<PB N="429" REF="439">
Berne; which is not only free from debts, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very con&s;iderable fund in re&s;erve.</P>
<P>This remarkable in&s;titution, may be con&s;idered as a political &s;eminary for the youth of Berne. It renders them ac|quainted with the con&s;titution of their country; and, as in their frequent a&s;&s;em|blies the &s;everal members debate upon all kinds of political &s;ubjects, it affords them an opportunity of exerci&s;ing and improv|ing their talents; and by that means of becoming more capable of &s;erving the public, whenever they may be admitted to a &s;hare in the admini&s;tration of govern|ment.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Langenau, <DATE>Sept. 18.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have heard, perhaps, of Mi|chel Schuppach, the famous Swi&s;s doctor; of who&s;e intuitive &s;agacity in di&s;|covering the &s;eat of di&s;orders, and ap|plying &s;uitable remedies to them, many wonderful &s;tories are recounted by tra|vellers,
<PB N="430" REF="440">
and which generally, I &s;uppo&s;e, have encrea&s;ed in the marvellous, like Virgil's Progre&s;s of Fame, in proportion as they receded from the &s;cene of action. I am now lodged in the hou&s;e of this celebrated Ae&s;culapius: it is &s;ituated above the village of Langenau, on the &s;ide of a &s;teep mountain; and from that cir|cum&s;tance he is generally known by the appellation of <HI>the phy&s;ician of the moun|tain.</HI></P>
<P>Upon our arrival here we found the doctor in his apartment, &s;urrounded by a number of pea&s;ants, who were con&s;ulting him upon their re&s;pective complaints; each having brought with him a &s;mall bottle, containing &s;ome of his water: for, it is by in&s;pecting the urine that this medical &s;age pretends to judge of the &s;tate of the pa|tient. His figure is extremely corpulent; he has a penetrating eye; and one of the be&s;t-humoured countenances I ever &s;aw. He &s;ets him&s;elf oppo&s;ite to the per&s;on who con&s;ults him, one moment examining the water, and the next the patient; and continues regarding alternately the one and the other for &s;ome time, always whi&s;t|ling during the intervals. He then opens
<PB N="431" REF="441">
the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, acquaints the con|&s;ultant with the nature of his complaints, and has often the good fortune to hit upon the true cau&s;e. In a word, his knack of di&s;covering di&s;orders by urine, has gained &s;uch implicit faith in his &s;kill, that one might as well doubt of the Pope's infallibility before a zealous catholic, as of the doctor's in the pre&s;ence of his pa|tients. He has certainly performed &s;e|veral great cures; and the rumour of them hath brought him patients from all quar|ters of Europe. There are at this time in his hou&s;e, and in the village, &s;everal En|gli&s;h and French people, together with many Swi&s;s, who are come hither for his advice.</P>
<P>The doctor was formerly, it &s;eems, a village &s;urgeon, has a &s;light tincture of anatomy, and is e&s;teemed a proficient in botany and chemi&s;try; but his reputa|tion as a phy&s;ician has now been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed &s;ome years. He is &s;aid to have but little acquaintance with the theory of phy&s;ic; the greate&s;t part of his know|ledge being derived from his exten&s;ive practice, notwith&s;tanding he never &s;tirs a quarter of a mile from his own hou&s;e;
<PB N="432" REF="442">
for he would not take the trouble of go|ing to Berne, even to attend the King of France.</P>
<P>It is more than probable, that much of this extraordinary man's &s;ucce&s;s in his practice, is owing to the great faith of his patients, to the benefit they receive from change of climate, to the &s;alubri|ous air of this mountain, and to the amu&s;ement ari&s;ing from that con&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of different company which a&s;|&s;emble in this place, in order to apply to him for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But whatever may have been the cau&s;es of his celebrity, it has come to him, as all accounts agree, un&s;ought for by him&s;elf. He has cer|tainly many excellent qualities: humane and charitable to the highe&s;t degree; he not only furni&s;hes the indigent pea&s;ants who con&s;ult him, with medicines gratis, but generally makes them a pre&s;ent in money be&s;ides; and he always appropriates a certain portion of his gains to the poor of his pari&s;h. His wife, as al&s;o his grand|daughters who live with him, are dre&s;&s;ed like the pea&s;ant women of the country; and he has &s;hewn his good &s;en&s;e in giv|ing the latter no better than a plain edu|cation:
<PB N="433" REF="443">
the elde&s;t he be&s;towed in mar|riage, when &s;he was but fifteen, upon one of his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and gave with her 1300l.; no incon&s;iderable portion for this country. He procured a match for her &s;o early, he &s;aid, to prevent her being &s;poiled by the young gentlemen tell|ing her &s;he was pretty, and in&s;piring her with the ambition of marrying above her rank.</P>
<P>If dome&s;tic harmony, and the mo&s;t per|fect &s;implicity of manners, have any pre|ten&s;ions to plea&s;e, you would be highly delighted with this rural family. The wife is a notable, active woman, and not only &s;uperintends all the hou&s;hold affairs with remarkable cleverne&s;s, but even per|forms great part of the bu&s;ine&s;s with her own hands: &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ts her hu&s;band like|wi&s;e in making up his medicines; and as he talks no other language than the Swi&s;s-German, &s;he &s;erves occa&s;ionally as his interpreter. And, as a proof of his con|fidence in her admini&s;tration of his af|fairs, &s;he acts al&s;o as his trea&s;urer, and receives all his fees; which, in the cour&s;e of a year, amount to a con&s;iderable &s;um: for, although he never demands more
<PB N="434" REF="444">
than the price of his medicines, yet no gentleman con&s;ults him without giving him an additional gratuity. Many pre|&s;ents have likewi&s;e been made to her&s;elf, from per&s;ons who have reaped benefit by her hu&s;band's pre&s;criptions: &s;everal of the&s;e con&s;i&s;t of valuable trinkets, with which on days of ceremony &s;he decks her|&s;elf forth to the be&s;t advantage, in the &s;imple dre&s;s of the country.</P>
<P>The family &s;it down to table regularly at twelve o'clock; there are always &s;ome &s;trangers of the party, con&s;i&s;ting not only of a certain number of per&s;ons who are under the doctor's care, but of travellers like our&s;elves, who are led hither by mo|tives of mere curio&s;ity. When the wea|ther is fine, and their gue&s;ts more nu|merous than u&s;ual, dinner is &s;erved out of doors in an open &s;hed, that looks upon one &s;ide of the mountain and the adja|cent country, with a di&s;tant view of the glaciers beyond the lake of Thun. Ye&s;|terday &s;ome pea&s;ants, whom the doctor had invited, formed part of our com|pany; after dinner, he gave &s;ome money to tho&s;e that &s;ate near him, and ordered one of his grand-daughters to di&s;tribute
<PB N="435" REF="445">
his bounty to the others. The benevo|lence of the old man, his gaiety and good|humour, the chearfulne&s;s of his family, the gratitude of the poor pea&s;ants, the beauty of the pro&s;pect, and the finene&s;s of the weather, formed all together the mo&s;t agreeable and delightful &s;cenes I ever be|held; and I do not remember in my whole life to have partaken of any meal with a more &s;en&s;ible and heart-felt &s;a|tisfaction.</P>
<P>This &s;ingular man is very often em|ployed in giving his advice from eight in the morning till &s;ix in the evening, with no other intermi&s;&s;ion than during the time he is at table. His drugs are of the be&s;t kind; for he collects the &s;imples, as well as di&s;tills them, him&s;elf. His hou&s;e, like tho&s;e of the pea&s;ants, is con&s;tructed of wood; and, though always full of people, is remarkably neat and clean. In &s;hort, every thing about him has the appearance of the plea&s;ing &s;implicity of former ages.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgotten to tell you, that I con&s;ulted him this morning my&s;elf; and a&s;&s;uredly I have rea&s;on to be highly &s;a|tisfied with his pre&s;cription: for, he told me I was in &s;uch good health, that the
<PB N="436" REF="446">
only advice he had to give me, was <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to eat and drink well, to dance, be merry, and take moderate exerci&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>It is now Langenau fair, and the vil|lage is crowded with the neighbouring pea&s;ants. Great numbers of the men have long beards, and many of them co|ver their heads with a woman's &s;traw hat, extremely broad, which gives them a very grote&s;que appearance: their dre&s;s is chiefly a coar&s;e brown cloth jacket without &s;leeves; with large puffed breeches of ticking. The women wear their hair plaited be|hind in tre&s;&s;es, with the riband hang|ing down below the wai&s;t; a flat plain &s;traw hat, which is very becoming; a red or brown cloth jacket without &s;leeves; a black or blue petticoat bordered with red and &s;carcely reaching below the knees; red &s;tockings with black clocks, and no heels to their &s;hoes; their &s;hifts fa&s;tened clo&s;e round the throat by a black collar with red ornaments; the better &s;ort have chains of &s;ilver between the &s;houlders, brought round under each arm, and fa|&s;tened beneath the bo&s;om, the ends hang|ing down with &s;ome &s;ilver ornaments.</P>
<P>I am &s;o charmed with the &s;ituation of
<PB N="437" REF="447">
this village, the chearfulne&s;s and &s;ingula|rity of this ru&s;tic and agreeable family, and the uncommon character of the hu|mane doctor, that I could with plea&s;ure continue here &s;ome days more: but I am pre&s;&s;ed for time, and have a long journey before me.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Geneva, <DATE>Sept. 26.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I TOOK leave of my friends at Lan|genau, in order to proceed to Avig|non; where I am going to pay a vi&s;it to the <HI>Abb&eacute; de Sade,</HI> author of the inte|re&s;ting memoirs of the life of Petrarch. A re&s;pectable and knowing old gentle|man of Soleure, one of the members of their &s;overeign council, with whom I had the good fortune to fall into ac|quaintance during my &s;tay at the doc|tor's, offered me a place in his carriage to Berne: and, as my principal object in travelling is to acquire all the u&s;eful in|telligence I can by any means obtain; I very gladly embraced this opportunity of
<PB N="438" REF="448">
leading my worthy and well-informed companion into a conver&s;ation, not only concerning the government of Soleure in particular, but in relation al&s;o to Swi&s;|&s;erland in general. I found him exceed|ingly well-di&s;po&s;ed to give me all po&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction, in an&s;wer to the &s;everal que&s;|tions he very obligingly allowed me to propo&s;e to him.</P>
<P>In the afternoon I &s;aw a mo&s;t curious collection in natural hi&s;tory, belonging to Mr. Springling of Berne: it con&s;i&s;ted of about 200 &s;pecimens, in fine pre&s;er|vation, of birds both local and migra|tory, that are found in Swi&s;&s;erland. A|mong&s;t others, I ob&s;erved the common eagle, the golden vulture, the emberiza nivalis of Linnaeus, and the &s;now hen, who&s;e feathers in winter are perfectly white, and in &s;ummer &s;potted.</P>
<P>The next day I repa&s;&s;ed through Mo|rat and Avenches, and &s;lept at Payerne, a town in the canton of Berne, which enjoys con&s;iderable privileges. Upon the bridge over the Broye, is an antient Ro|man in&s;cription: as I was endeavouring to decypher it, a plain-looking man ac|co&s;ted me in a very &s;olemn tone of voice,
<PB N="439" REF="449">
and &s;aid, he had often tried to make out the in&s;cription; and though he could read very well, and had a &s;mattering in Latin, he could never make any thing of it. <Q REND="inline">"For," added he, "what can be the meaning of N and I and O, and all tho&s;e great letters, which &s;eem to have no connection with each other? Give me a page of plain Latin, and I know what I am about; I will tran&s;late it you from the beginning to the end; but for the&s;e Ns, Is and Os; take my word for it, notwith&s;tanding all your pains, you will never be a jot the wi&s;er."</Q> However, as I did not &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to follow his advice, but continued decy|phering the in&s;cription (which was by no means a difficult ta&s;k) he appeared a&s;to|ni&s;hed at my ob&s;tinacy, and left me, with an apparent air of pity, to my hopele&s;s fortune,</P>
<P>Moudon is an hand&s;ome town, the prin|cipal burgh of a bailliage of the &s;ame name, and formerly the capital of all that part of the Pays de Vaud, which belonged to the Duke of Savoy. It was al&s;o the or|dinary re&s;idence of his chief bailiff, and the place where the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates
<PB N="440" REF="450">
were accu&s;tomed to meet: at pre&s;ent it contains nothing remarkable. The bai|liff appointed by the &s;overeign council of Berne, re&s;ides in the ca&s;tle of Lucens, built upon the &s;ummit of a mountain, in a &s;ituation exceedingly picture&s;que. This ca&s;tle formerly belonged to the bi|&s;hops of Lau&s;anne, and was one of their favourite &s;eats before the reformation was introduced into the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>At Lau&s;anne I had propo&s;ed to cro&s;s the Lake of Geneva to Meillerie; in|tending to go in que&s;t of that ro|mantic &s;pot de&s;cribed by St. Preux in Rou&s;&s;eau's Eloi&s;e, and which a country|man of ours a&s;&s;ured me he had di&s;cover|ed: from thence I meant to coa&s;t along the &s;outhern &s;ide of the lake, and touch upon the &s;everal towns of Chablais. Every thing was prepared for this expedition; but unfortunately a &s;udden change of weather put an end to the&s;e amu&s;ing pro|jects; no waterman would undertake to carry me. The lake indeed was vehe|mently agitated with a mo&s;t violent &s;torm, &s;imilar to that which is de&s;cribed in the letter I have mentioned; and, as I had no Julia to induce me to hazard the dan|ger,
<PB N="441" REF="451">
I felt no inclination to ri&s;k it for the &s;ake of &s;atisfying a mere fanciful cu|rio&s;ity. Accordingly I made the be&s;t of my way by land to Cra&s;&s;i, through the &s;ame beautiful variety of country I had pa&s;&s;ed before, and which cannot be re|viewed too often.</P>
<P>In my way to Geneva the day follow|ing, I dined with an Engli&s;hman at Gen|thoud; where I expected to have had the permi&s;&s;ion of waiting upon Mr. Bonnet, the celebrated naturali&s;t; to whom I was very ambitious of being known. Un|fortunately, however, his wife was taken ill; and I was debarred the great &s;atis|faction I had propo&s;ed to my&s;elf, of &s;ee|ing and conver&s;ing with &s;o de&s;ervedly emi|nent a philo&s;opher, who&s;e indefatigable indu&s;try in &s;earching into the &s;everal phae|nomena of nature, is equalled only by his ingenuity in explaining them.</P>
<P>The town of Geneva lies upon the narrowe&s;t part of the extremity of the lake, where the Rhone i&s;&s;ues out in two large and rapid &s;treams, which &s;oon afterwards unite. That river divides the town into two unequal parts; receives the muddy Arve in its cour&s;e; and flows
<PB N="442" REF="452">
through part of France into the Medi|terranean. <HI>Here</HI> its waters are of a mo&s;t beautiful tran&s;parent green, like tho&s;e of the Rhine when it flows from the lake of Con&s;tance. The adjacent country is un|commonly picture&s;que; and I could not &s;ufficiently admire the magnificent views it exhibits: the &s;everal objects which com|po&s;ed this enchanting pro&s;pect, were, the town; the lake; the numerous hills and mountains, particularly the Saleve and the Mole, ri&s;ing &s;uddenly from the plain in a wonderful variety of fanta&s;tic forms, backed by the glaciers of Savoy, with their frozen tops gli&s;tening in the &s;un; and the maje&s;tic Mont Blanc lifting up its head far above the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The town, which lies partly in the plain upon the borders of the lake, and partly upon a gentle a&s;cent, is irregularly built; the hou&s;es are high, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e which &s;tand in the trading part of the city, have arcades of wood, which are carried up to their tops. The&s;e arcades, which are &s;upported by pillars, ob&s;truct the &s;treets, and give them a gloomy ap|pearance; but they are u&s;eful to the in|habitants in protecting them from the
<PB N="443" REF="453">
&s;un and the rain. Geneva is by far the mo&s;t populous town in Swi&s;&s;erland: for, Zuric, which comes next to it in re&s;pect of population, contains &s;carcely thirteen thou&s;and &s;ouls; whereas the inhabitants of this place amount to twenty-four thou|&s;and. This &s;uperiority is undoubtedly owing to the greater indu&s;try and activity of the inhabitants; to its more exten&s;ive commerce; to the facility of purcha&s;ing the burgher&s;hip, and to the privileges which government allows to all foreign|ers who &s;ettle here. The members of this city are di&s;tingui&s;hed into citizens and burghe&s;&s;es, inhabitants and natives. The citizens and burghe&s;&s;es are alone admitted to a &s;hare in the government: the <HI>inha|bitants</HI> are &s;trangers who are allowed to &s;ettle in the town with certain privileges; and the <HI>natives</HI> are the &s;ons of tho&s;e inha|bitants, who po&s;&s;e&s;s certain additional ad|vantages. The two la&s;t cla&s;&s;es form a large majority of the people.</P>
<P>The liberal policy of this government, in receiving &s;trangers and conferring the burgher&s;hip, is the more remarkable as it is contrary to the &s;pirit of mo&s;t of the other &s;tates of Swi&s;&s;erland. It is here,
<PB N="444" REF="454">
indeed, more nece&s;&s;ary; the territory of this republic being &s;o exceedingly &s;mall, that its very exi&s;tence depends upon the number and indu&s;try of the people: for, exclu&s;ive of the inhabitants of the town, there are &s;carcely &s;ixteen thou&s;and &s;ouls in the whole di&s;trict of the Genevois.</P>
<P>To a man of letters, Geneva is parti|cularly intere&s;ting; as every branch of &s;cience is here cultivated in the mo&s;t ad|vantageous manner: learning is dive&s;ted of pedantry, and philo&s;ophy united with a knowledge of the world. The plea|&s;ures of &s;ociety are here mixed with the pur&s;uits of literature; and elegance and urbanity give a ze&s;t to the profounde&s;t di&s;qui&s;itions. Nor are letters confined in this city merely to tho&s;e who engage in them as a profe&s;&s;ion, or to tho&s;e who&s;e fortune and lei&s;ure enable them to follow where genius leads, and enter into a &s;tu|dious life by voluntary choice; even the lower cla&s;s of people are exceedingly well informed; and there is no city in Europe where learning is &s;o univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed among the inhabitants. I have had great &s;atisfaction in conver&s;ing with &s;everal of the &s;hop-keepers upon topics both of
<PB N="445" REF="455">
literature and politics; and was a&s;to|ni&s;hed to find, in this cla&s;s of men, &s;o un|common a &s;hare of knowledge. But the wonder cea&s;es, when we are told, that they have all of them received an excellent education at the public academy, where the children of the inhabitants are taught, under the in&s;pection of the magi&s;trates, and at the expence of government.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance in this &s;emi|nary, which particularly contributes to the exciting of the indu&s;try and emulation of the &s;tudents: prizes are annually di&s;|tributed to tho&s;e, who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in each cla&s;s. The&s;e rewards con&s;i&s;t of &s;mall medals, and they are con|ferred with &s;uch &s;olemnity as cannot fail of producing great effect. A yearly meeting is held at the cathedral, of all the magi&s;trates, profe&s;&s;ors, and principal in|habitants of the town; when the fir&s;t &s;yndic him&s;elf di&s;tributes, in the mo&s;t public manner, the &s;everal honorary re|tributions to tho&s;e who have de&s;erved them. I met this morning one of the &s;cholars, and, &s;eeing his medal, a&s;ked him what it meant? <Q REND="inline">"Je la porte," replied the little man, &s;carce eight years old,
<PB N="446" REF="456">
"parce que j'ai fait mon devoir."</Q> I wanted no &s;tronger proof to convince me of the beneficial influence, upon young minds, of the&s;e encouraging and judicious di&s;tinctions, than appeared from the &s;prightly &s;pecimen before me.</P>
<P>The inhabitants enjoy the advantage al&s;o of having free acce&s;s to the public library; and by this privilege, they not only retain but improve that general tinc|ture of learning which they imbibe in their early youth: when I vi&s;ited this li|brary, it happened to be crowded with &s;tudents, who were returning the books they had borrowed, and demanding others. As I pa&s;&s;ed only an hour in this room, I am ill qualified to give you a ju&s;t idea of its contents: I reque&s;ted, however, the librarian to point out to me what was mo&s;t worthy of particular no|tice. Accordingly, among other books and manu&s;cripts, he &s;hewed me &s;everal folio volumes containing letters and other writings of Calvin, which have never been publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Although Zuingle, Aecolampadius, and Haller, had reformed the greate&s;t part of Swi&s;&s;erland, &s;ome years before Calvin
<PB N="447" REF="457">
made his appearance at Geneva; yet the latter, as Voltaire ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, has given his name to the &s;ectaries of the reformed religion, in the &s;ame manner as the new continent took its appella|tion from Americus Ve&s;pa&s;ius, although the original di&s;covery was made by Co|lumbus. Neither was Calvin, indeed, the fir&s;t reformer even of Geneva; but, as he gave additional &s;trength and &s;olidity to the new e&s;tabli&s;hment, and laid the foundation of that eccle&s;ia&s;tical form of government, which has ever &s;ince been invariably o&s;erved; he totally eclip&s;ed the fame of his friend William Farel, who &s;cattered the fir&s;t &s;eeds of reforma|tion, which the other brought to matu|rity. In truth, &s;o great was the a&s;cen|dancy which this extraordinary man, al|though a &s;tranger in Geneva, acquired over the citizens, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no in|con&s;iderable influence even in civil mat|ters; and bore a large &s;hare in &s;ettling the political con&s;titution of the republic. But his care and attention was not wholly confined to eccle&s;ia&s;tical and political concerns; he promoted, to the utmo&s;t of his power, the cultivation of the liberal
<PB N="448" REF="458">
arts and &s;ciences, and the &s;tudy of ele|gant literature. To this end, as well as for the encouraging of theological erudi|tion, he prevailed upon the government of Geneva to e&s;tabli&s;h a public academy. In this new &s;eminary, him&s;elf, together with his colleagues, eminent for their &s;uperior knowledge, read lectures, with &s;uch uncommon reputation and &s;ucce&s;s, that the youth from all quarters flocked to receive the benefit of them: and it has &s;ent forth, from its bo&s;om, men of the greate&s;t di&s;tinction for their learning and abilities.</P>
<P>There is &s;uch a &s;triking &s;plendor in the brighter parts of this di&s;intere&s;ted and celebrated reformer's character, that ren|ders one, at the fir&s;t glance, almo&s;t in&s;en|&s;ible of tho&s;e dark &s;pots in it, which have &s;o ju&s;tly &s;ullied its glory. But when one reflects a moment on the a&s;perity, the ar|rogance, the pre&s;umptuous opiniatrety, of his temper and conduct, and, above all, on his cruel per&s;ecution of his former friend, the unhappy Servetus; one laments, with abhorrence, the mortifying in&s;tance this famous man exhibited, that the noble&s;t qualities &s;ometimes mix with the ba&s;e&s;t,
<PB N="449" REF="459">
in the compo&s;ition of human nature. With regard, however, to his intolerant principles; it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the &s;ame uncharitable &s;pirit prevailed al&s;o among &s;ome others of the mo&s;t celebrated reformers; who &s;eemed to think, by a &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tency, and unaccountable blindne&s;s not only to the genius, but to the cleare&s;t precepts of the go&s;pel, that per&s;ecution for con&s;cience &s;ake was un|chri&s;tian in every eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, except their own. This ab&s;urd and dangerous opinion, gave great ad|vantage to their adver&s;aries of the papal hierarchy: for, it is obvious to the meane&s;t under&s;tanding, that, if per&s;ecution is ju&s;ti|fiable in any particular church, it mu&s;t be &s;o univer&s;ally.</P>
<P>The republic of Geneva is, however, at pre&s;ent, the mo&s;t tolerating of all the reformed &s;tates of Swi&s;&s;erland; being the only government in this country, which permits the Lutheran religion to be pub|licly exerci&s;ed. In this re&s;pect the clergy, no le&s;s wi&s;ely, than &s;uitably to the &s;pirit, as well as the letter, of the Chri&s;tian re|velation, have renounced the principles of their great patriarch, Calvin: for, although
<PB N="450" REF="460">
they &s;till hold that able reformer in high veneration; yet they know how to di&s;tin|gui&s;h his virtues from his defects, and to admire the one without being blindly partial to the other.</P>

<P>I Write to you a third time from Ge|neva: de&s;irous of gaining as much information concerning its hi&s;tory, and the nature of its government, as po&s;&s;ible; I vi&s;ited this town again in my return from Avignon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the beginning of the former letter.</NOTE> into Swi&s;&s;erland. I will now, therefore, endeavour to throw to|gether, from my notes relating to the &s;ubject, all that appears worth communi|cating to you; premi&s;ing at the &s;ame time, that I find them &s;uch an indige&s;ted ma&s;s, as to have rea&s;on to fear I &s;hall not be able to reduce them into &s;o clear an order, as not to &s;tand much in need of your candour, when you peru&s;e the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="461">
The town of Geneva and its territory, were formerly united to the German em|pire, under the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Charlemain: but as the power of the emperors, feeble even in Germany, was &s;till weaker in the frontier provinces; the bi&s;hops of Ge|neva, like &s;everal other great va&s;&s;als of the empire, gradually acquired very con&s;iderable authority over the city and its domains; which the emperors had no other means of counterbalancing, than by encrea&s;ing the liberties of the people. During the&s;e times of confu&s;ion, con|&s;tant di&s;putes &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the bi|&s;hops and the counts of the Genevois; for, the latter, although at their fir&s;t in&s;titution merely officers of the em|peror, and con&s;idered as va&s;&s;als of the bi|&s;hops; yet they claimed and a&s;&s;erted a right to the exclu&s;ive admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. The citizens took advantage of the&s;e quarrels; and, by &s;iding occa&s;ionally with each party, obtained an exten&s;ion of their privileges from both.</P>
<P>But the hou&s;e of Savoy having pur|cha&s;ed the county of the Genevois, and &s;ucceeded to all the prerogatives of the counts, with additional power; the bi|&s;hops
<PB N="452" REF="462">
and the people firmly united toge|ther, in order to oppo&s;e the encroach|ments of the former, which were no le&s;s prejudicial to the authority of the one, than to the liberties of the others. Dur|ing this period, the re&s;pective preten|&s;ions of the counts, the bi&s;hops, and the citizens, were &s;o various, as to form a government equally &s;ingular and com|plicated. This harmony, however, be|tween the bi&s;hops and citizens, was at length broken by the artful management of the counts of Savoy, who had the ad|dre&s;s to procure the epi&s;copal &s;ee for their brothers, and even for their illegitimate children. By the&s;e methods, their power in the city became &s;o enlarged, that, to|wards the commencement of the &s;ixteenth century, Charles III, duke of Savoy, (al|though the form of the government was entirely republican) obtained an almo&s;t ab|&s;olute authority over the citizens: and he exerci&s;ed it in the mo&s;t unju&s;t and ar|bitrary manner Hence aro&s;e perpetual &s;truggles between the duke and the citi|zens; the latter continually oppo&s;ing, either by open violence, or &s;ecret mea|&s;ures, his tyrannical u&s;urpation: thus
<PB N="453" REF="463">
two parties were formed; the zealots for liberty were called <HI>eidgeno&s;&s;en,</HI> or confe|derates; while the parti&s;ans of the duke were branded with the appellation of <HI>mammelucs,</HI> or &s;laves.</P>
<P>The treaty of alliance which the town entered into with Berne and Fribourg, in 1526, may be con&s;idered as the true aera of its liberty and independence: for, not long after, the duke was de&s;poiled of his authority; the bi&s;hop driven from the city; a republican form of government firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed; and the reformation introduced. From this time, Charles and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors waged ince&s;&s;ant war again&s;t the town: but his ho&s;tilities were ren|dered ineffectual, by the intrepid bravery of the citizens, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the canton of Berne.</P>
<P>In 1584 Geneva entered into a treaty of perpetual alliance with Zuric and Berne, (Fribourg having renounced their alliance when the town embraced the re|formation) by which treaty, it is allied with the Swi&s;s cantons.</P>
<P>The la&s;t attempt of the hou&s;e of Sa|voy again&s;t Geneva, was in 1602; when Charles Emanuel treacherou&s;ly attacked

the town during a profound peace. Two hundred of his &s;oldiers &s;caled the walls in the night, when the inhabitants were repo&s;ed in un&s;u&s;pecting &s;ecurity; but be|ing timely di&s;covered, they were repul&s;ed by the de&s;perate valour of a few citizens, who gloriou&s;ly &s;acrificed their lives in defence of the liberties of their country. In memory of this event, an in&s;cription is fixed upon the town-hou&s;e; and &s;ome of the &s;caling-ladders, which the enemy made u&s;e of to enter the town, are pre|&s;erved in the ar&s;enal. This perfidy oc|ca&s;ioned a war, which was terminated the year following by a &s;olemn treaty; &s;ince which, uninterrupted peace has been main|tained between the hou&s;e of Savoy and Geneva: but it was not till 1754, that the king of Sardinia acknowledged, by a formal act, the independence of this re|public.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was peace concluded with the hou&s;e of Savoy, than the flames of internal di&s;cord, &s;o apt to kindle in po|pular governments, and which had been &s;mothered by their common danger from a foreign enemy, began to appear. Ac|cordingly, during the greate&s;t part of the
<PB N="455" REF="465">
la&s;t century, to the pre&s;ent period, the hi&s;|tory of Geneva contains little more than a narrative of contentions between the ari&s;tocratical and the popular party. The&s;e mutual &s;truggles have occa&s;ionally been exerted with &s;o much violence and ani|mo&s;ity, as to have threatened, for a mo|ment, a total revolution in the &s;tate; but happily, however, they have always been compromi&s;ed without producing any fa|tal effects.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, the power of the council of two hundred was become almo&s;t ab&s;olute. In order to re&s;train their authority, the po|pular party, in 1707, procured a law, by which it was enacted, that every five years a general council of all the citizens and burghers &s;hould be holden, to deliberate upon the affairs of the republic. Agree|ably to this law, a general a&s;&s;embly was convened in 1712; and the very fir&s;t act exerted by the people in this their col|lective capacity, was the total abolition of the above-mentioned ordinance. An event of &s;o &s;ingular a nature, can hardly be accounted for upon the general prin|ciple of p pular ficklene&s;s and incon&s;i&s;t|ency:
<PB N="456" REF="466">
accordingly Rou&s;&s;eau, in his <HI>Let|tres ecrites de la Montagne,</HI> imputes it to the artifices of the magi&s;trates; and to the equivocal terms marked upon the bil|lets then in u&s;e. For, the que&s;tion propo&s;ed to the people being, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whether the opi|nion of the councils, for aboli&s;hing the periodical general a&s;&s;emblies, &s;hould pa&s;s into a law?"</Q> the words employed on the billets delivered for that purpo&s;e, were, <HI>approbation, rejection;</HI> &s;o that whichever &s;ide was taken, it came to the &s;ame point.

Accordingly, &s;e|veral of the citizens afterwards complain|ed that they had been deceived, as they ne|ver meant to reject the general a&s;&s;embly, but only the opinion of the councils<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;cellaneous Works of Rou&s;&s;eau, Vol. iv. p. 279.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this extraordinary repeal, the power of the ari&s;tocracy con|tinued encrea&s;ing till within the&s;e few years; when the citizens, by a &s;ingular conjunction of favourable circum&s;tances, joined to an uncommon &s;pirit of union
<PB N="457" REF="467">
and per&s;everance, have procured &s;everal changes to be made in the con&s;titution of Geneva; by which the authority of the magi&s;trates has been limited, and the privileges of the people have been en|larged. Happy! if they know where to &s;top; le&s;t, continuing to extend the bounds of their own prerogatives, they &s;hake the foundations of civil government, by too much re&s;training the power of the ma|gi&s;trates.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent con&s;titution of Geneva, may be con&s;idered as a mean between that of the other ari&s;tocratical and po|pular cantons of Swi&s;&s;erland: more de|mocratical than any of the former, ina&s;|much as the &s;overeign and legi&s;lative au|thority entirely re&s;ides in the general a&s;|&s;embly of the citizens and burghers; and more ari&s;tocratical than the latter, be|cau&s;e the powers ve&s;ted in the great and little councils are very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The members of the &s;enate, or little council of twenty-five, enjoy, in their corporate capacity, &s;everal prerogatives almo&s;t as great as tho&s;e which are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by that of the mo&s;t ari&s;tocratical &s;tates. They nominate half the mem|bers
<PB N="458" REF="468">
of the great council; the principal magi&s;trates are taken from their body; they convoke the great council and the general a&s;&s;embly of the citizens and bur|ghers; they previou&s;ly deliberate upon every que&s;tion which is to be brought in|to the great council, and from thence into the general a&s;&s;embly: in other words, in them is lodged the power of propo|&s;ing; con&s;equently, as every act mu&s;t ori|ginate from them, no law can pa&s;s with|out their approbation. In this &s;enate is ve&s;ted al&s;o the chief executive power; the admini&s;tration of the finances; and, to a certain degree, juri&s;diction in civil and criminal cau&s;es. They nominate, like|wi&s;e, to mo&s;t of the &s;maller po&s;ts of go|vernment; and enjoy the &s;ole privilege of conferring burgher&s;hip. They com|po&s;e, moreover, in conjunction with thir|ty-five members of their own choo&s;ing, the &s;ecret council; which never a&s;&s;embles but by their convoking, and only upon extraordinary occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderable prerogatives, how|ever, are counterbalanced as well by the privileges of the great council, as by the franchi&s;es of the general a&s;&s;embly. The
<PB N="459" REF="469">
prerogatives of the former con&s;i&s;t in choo&s;|ing the members of the &s;enate from their own body; in receiving appeals in all cau&s;es above a certain value; in pardon|ing criminals; in di&s;po&s;ing of the mo&s;t important charges of government, tho&s;e excepted which are conferred by the ge|neral a&s;&s;embly; and in approving or re|jecting whatever is propo&s;ed by the &s;e|nate to be laid before the people.</P>
<P>The &s;overeign council, or general a&s;|&s;embly of the people, is compo&s;ed of the citizens and burghers of the town: their number, in general, amounts to about 1,500, but it is &s;eldom that more than 1,200 convene; the remainder being ei|ther &s;ettled in foreign countries, or are u&s;ually ab&s;ent. I ought to have explain|ed to you &s;ooner, the di&s;tinction between <HI>citizens</HI> and <HI>burghers:</HI> the latter, are ei|ther the &s;ons of citizens or burghers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The children of tho&s;e who are employed in fo|reign countries, in the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, although born out of Geneva, are entitled to all the privi|leges of citizens.</NOTE>, born out of Geneva, or have obtained the burgher&s;hip by purcha&s;e; the former, are the &s;ons of citizens or burghers, born within the town of Geneva. The burghers
<PB N="460" REF="470">
may be cho&s;en into the council of two hundred, but the citizens can alone enter into the &s;enate, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the charges appropriated to that body.</P>
<P>The general a&s;&s;embly meets twice a year; choo&s;es the principal magi&s;trates; a&s;&s;ents to or rejects the laws and regula|tions propo&s;ed by the councils; impo&s;es taxes; contracts alliances; declares war or peace; and nominates one half of the members of the great council. All que&s;|tions that come before them are decid|ed by the majority of voices; and each member delivers his vote without having the liberty of debating. The re&s;triction is certainly rea&s;onable; for, in a popu|lar a&s;&s;embly, like this of Geneva, com|po&s;ed of citizens, the meane&s;t of whom is well ver&s;ed in the con&s;titution of the commonwealth, and where the people in general have a &s;trong propen&s;ity to enter in|to political di&s;cu&s;&s;ions; if every voter were permitted to &s;upport and enforce his opi|nion by argument, there would be no end of debate, and the whole time would be con&s;umed in petulant declamation.</P>
<P>But the principal check to the power
<PB N="461" REF="471">
of the little council, ari&s;es from the me|thod of electing the &s;yndics, and from the right of <HI>repre&s;entation.</HI> With re&s;pect to the former, the four &s;yndics, or chiefs of the republic, are cho&s;en annually out of the little council, by the general a&s;|&s;embly; and there mu&s;t be an interval of three years before the &s;ame members can be again elected. The u&s;ual mode of elec|tion is as follows:&mdash;The little council no|minate eight of their members for can|didates, who mu&s;t be approved by the great council; and out of the&s;e eight, the general a&s;&s;embly choo&s;e the four &s;yndics. They have it in their power, however, not only to reject the&s;e eight propo&s;ed candidates, but al&s;o all the other mem|bers of the &s;enate &s;ucce&s;&s;ively: and in that ca&s;e, four members are taken from the great council, and propo&s;ed to the general a&s;&s;embly. If the&s;e are appointed &s;yndics, they immediately become mem|bers of the &s;enate; and an equal number of that body are at the &s;ame time de|graded, and retire into the great council. No in&s;tance, however, has yet occurred of the general a&s;&s;embly having exerted
<PB N="462" REF="472">
this power of expelling four members from the &s;enate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the above was written, I have been in|formed, that the citizens and burghers expelled four members from the &s;enate, at the election of magi&s;trates for the year 1777.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the other re&s;traint I mentioned upon the power of the little council, viz. the right of <HI>repre&s;entation:</HI> every citizen or burgher, either &s;ingly or in a body, has the privilege of applying to the &s;enate in order to procure &s;ome new re|gulation, or of remon&s;trating again&s;t any act of the magi&s;tracy. The&s;e repre&s;enta|tions have proved one of the principal means, perhaps, of &s;ecuring the liberties of the people from the re&s;pective en|croachments of the two councils; as they have frequently prevented the magi&s;trates from &s;tretching their authority to the &s;ame arbitrary extent that has been prac|ti&s;ed in &s;ome of the other commonwealths of Swi&s;&s;erland. The magi&s;trates are ob|liged to give an explicit an&s;wer to the&s;e repre&s;entations; for, if the fir&s;t is not con&s;idered as &s;atisfactory, a &s;econd re|mon&s;trance is pre&s;ented. According to the nature and importance of the com|plaint, the repre&s;entation is made by a
<PB N="463" REF="473">
greater or le&s;s number of citizens; and it has &s;ometimes happened that each remon|&s;trance has been accompanied by &s;everal hundred, in different bodies.</P>
<P>The &s;alaries of the &s;everal magi&s;trates are &s;o incon&s;iderable, as not to offer any temptation on the &s;ide of pecuniary emo|lument: a &s;en&s;e of honour, a &s;pirit of ambition, the de&s;ire of &s;erving their coun|try, together with that per&s;onal credit which is derived from exerci&s;ing any of|fice in the admini&s;tration, are the prin|cipal motives which actuate the candidates to &s;olicit a &s;hare in the magi&s;tracy. Ac|cordingly, the public po&s;ts are generally filled with men of the fir&s;t abilities, and of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters. The revenues of government, at the highe&s;t calculation, &s;carcely amount to 30,000 pounds a year; a &s;um, however, which, by a well-regulated oeconomy, is more than &s;ufficient to defray the current ex|pences: &s;o that this republic is enabled to provide for the &s;ecurity of its &s;ubjects, from an income, which &s;ome individuals, both in England and France, &s;quander in vain pomp and vicious di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable that, in a republic
<PB N="464" REF="474">
&s;o free as this of Geneva, and where the true principles of liberty are &s;o well and &s;o generally under&s;tood, there &s;hould be no preci&s;e code of penal laws: for, al|though the form of the proce&s;s is &s;ettled with great preci&s;ion, yet the trial of the criminal is private, and the puni&s;hment left to the arbitrary deci&s;ion of the magi&s;|trate. Nor are the franchi&s;es of the peo|ple a&s;certained with that accuracy one might well have expected. Indeed, un|der Ademar Fabri, bi&s;hop of Geneva in the fourteenth century, a certain num|ber of political regulations, both civil and criminal, together with &s;everal particular cu&s;toms and liberties, were drawn up in form; and the bi&s;hop took an oath to ob|&s;erve them. The&s;e &s;tatutes, if they may be &s;o called, were al&s;o confirmed by Ama|deus VIII, duke of Savoy. In all ca&s;es of controver&s;y, the people appeal to this code; but it is not only compiled in a very inaccurate and confu&s;ed manner, but the magi&s;trates refu&s;e to be governed by it, becau&s;e it was publi&s;hed before the independence of the republic was con|firmed. With re&s;pect to the &s;everal laws which have &s;ince been enacted in the ge|neral
<PB N="465" REF="475">
a&s;&s;embly; &s;ome few of them indeed are printed, and in the hands of the pub|lic, but the re&s;t remain in the archives of the &s;enate: for, there being no par|ticular &s;ecretary belonging to the general a&s;&s;embly; all the laws which they pa&s;s are taken down by the &s;ecretary to the &s;e|nate; &s;o that the latter are the &s;ole depo|&s;itaries of tho&s;e edicts which ought to be laid open to the in&s;pection of the whole community. The people have repeatedly demanded a preci&s;e code of municipal and penal laws, &s;o expre&s;s and determinate, that nothing may be left to the arbitrary deci&s;ion of the magi&s;trate; but the &s;enate has always found means of evading this very rea&s;on|able and ju&s;t requi&s;ition.</P>
<P>Their code of civil law is the mo&s;t per|fect part of this con&s;titution: all matters concerning commerce are well regulated by it; and private property &s;ecurely guarded. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to trouble you with a particular detail of the &s;umptuary laws; they are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e in mo&s;t of the other &s;tates of Swi&s;&s;erland, where re&s;trictions of that kind are en|forced. But there is one law, relating to bankrupts, too &s;ingularly &s;evere not to be mentioned. If a member of either
<PB N="466" REF="476">
council becomes a bankrupt, he is im|mediately degraded; and from that mo|ment is rendered incapable of holding any po&s;t under government, until he &s;hall have di&s;charged all the ju&s;t demands of his creditors: even his children are &s;ub|jected to the &s;ame di&s;grace; and no citi|zen can exerci&s;e any public employment what&s;oever, while the debts of his father remain unpaid.</P>
<P>In this city, as in all the other princi|pal towns of Swi&s;&s;erland, a public gra|nary is e&s;tabli&s;hed. Magazines of this kind are u&s;eful in all &s;tates, but are more particularly nece&s;&s;ary in &s;o populous a place as Geneva; which, if the neigh|bouring powers were to prohibit the ex|portation of corn into the territory of the republic, might be expo&s;ed to all the hor|rors of a general famine. The benefit of this in&s;titution has been frequently experienced in times of &s;carcity: and all authors who have publi&s;hed ob&s;ervations upon the government of Geneva, have agreed in mentioning it with the prai&s;es it de&s;erves. But they have overlooked one great defect in its regulation, and which is not imputable to the manage|ment of tho&s;e public granaries which are
<PB N="467" REF="477">
e&s;tabli&s;hed in Berne and Zuric. The <HI>chamber of corn,</HI> as it is here called, is a committee from the great council of two hundred, empowered to &s;upply the gra|nary with that commodity, at the expence of government. This corn is dried by means of machines well contrived for that purpo&s;e; retailed out to the inn|keepers and bakers; a con&s;iderable profit accrues to government; and there is al|ways, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, a &s;ufficient quantity in re&s;erve to &s;upport the inha|bitants during a year and an half. Thus far, all is right: but then the burden of this in&s;titution falls upon the poor. For, as the directors buy the corn at the cheape&s;t rate; retail that part of it which has been kept the longe&s;t; and vend it at an higher price than it is &s;old in the neighbouring territories; the bakers mu&s;t con&s;equently &s;ell their bread dearer, and not of &s;o good a quality, as that which may be purcha&s;ed on the frontiers of Sa|voy. But the importation of bread is &s;trictly prohibited: tho&s;e families, there|fore, who can afford it, lay in a provi&s;ion of corn for their own u&s;e; while the poorer &s;ort &s;uffer, by being obliged to pur|cha&s;e, at an advanced price, their daily
<PB N="468" REF="478">
provi&s;ion from the bakers. Perhaps, however, the government is not &s;uffici|ently rich to put their granary upon the &s;ame footing with tho&s;e of Berne and Zuric, by &s;acrificing the profit ari&s;ing from the chamber of corn.</P>
<P>The town is &s;trongly fortified on the &s;ide of Savoy; and a garri&s;on of about nine hundred men con&s;tantly maintained: but the&s;e fortifications, and this garri&s;on, are only &s;ufficient to guard them from any &s;udden attack; they could not de|fend them long again&s;t a regular &s;iege. The great &s;ecurity of the republic con|&s;i&s;ts in its alliance with the Swi&s;s can|tons, by means of Zuric and Berne: and, as it is the intere&s;t both of the king of France and the king of Sardinia to keep well with the Swi&s;s, and to pre&s;erve the independence of Geneva; it derives its greate&s;t &s;ecurity from what, in &s;ome ca&s;es, would be its greate&s;t danger; name|ly, that its territory borders upon the do|minions of &s;uch powerful neighbours.</P>
<P>This republic is the only commonwealth in Swi&s;&s;erland, that has no regular com|panies in any foreign &s;ervice; wi&s;ely pro|hibiting the enli&s;ting of mercenaries in every part of its territory.</P>

<P>THE &s;mall territory of Bienne, containing &s;carcely &s;ix thou&s;and inhabitants, lies between the lake, and a chain of the Jura mountains: it is &s;ur|rounded by the cantons of Berne and So|leure, the bi&s;hoprick of Ba&s;il, and the principality of Neuchatel. The town is &s;ituated at the foot of the chain above|mentioned, and at a little di&s;tance from the lake; which is here about nine miles in length, and four in breadth: the bor|ders are plea&s;ing and picture&s;que; and the town of Nidau forms a very beauti|ful object upon its ea&s;tern &s;ide. In the mid&s;t of the lake is an i&s;land belonging to the canton of Berne, in which the per&s;ecuted Rou&s;&s;eau re&s;ided &s;ome months, after he had renounced all the rights of a citizen of Geneva, and until the go|vernment of Ba&s;il compelled him to quit their territory. I cannot forbear ob|&s;erving, upon this occa&s;ion, that the fate of this very ingenious philo&s;opher &s;eems to have been no le&s;s &s;ingular than his
<PB N="470" REF="480">
doctrine: for, after having been driven out of two republics, he found an a&s;ylum in the capital of an ab&s;olute government, and, what is more extraordinary, of that very government too, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have in&s;tigated the magi&s;trates of Ge|neva to exert an act of arbitrary power again&s;t him, which in its con&s;equence produced a diminution of their own au|thority.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of Ba&s;il is the &s;overeign of this little &s;tate: his power formerly was con&s;iderable, but at pre&s;ent is ex|ceedingly limited. Indeed the con&s;titu|tion of Bienne is of &s;o very peculiar a na|ture, that I know not well by what name to di&s;tingui&s;h it: it cannot properly be called either a limited monarchy, or an independent republic; it &s;eems rather to be a certain mixed government, partak|ing &s;omewhat of both.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of Ba&s;il, or the prince of Porentru, as he is called by the prote|&s;tant cantons, receives, upon his promo|tion to the bi&s;hoprick, the homage of the citizens and militia of this town, with all the apparent ceremonials of the mo&s;t ab|&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but at the &s;ame time,
<PB N="471" REF="481">
he confirms, in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, all their privileges and franchi&s;es. He is repre&s;ented by a mayor of his own ap|pointing, who&s;e power and office con|&s;i&s;t in convoking, and pre&s;iding in, the little council, as the chief court of ju&s;tice; in collecting the &s;uffrages, and declar|ing the &s;entence, but without giving any vote him&s;elf. And, although ju&s;tice is carried on, and executed, in the name of the prince, yet neither him&s;elf, nor the mayor, has the prerogative of pardoning criminals, or of mitigating the &s;entence. All cau&s;es, civil as well as criminal, are brought before this council in the fir&s;t in&s;tance; and in the more important ones, an appeal lies to the &s;overeign council: in both ca&s;es, each party choo&s;es a member of the council to act as his advocate; which office the member is obliged to di&s;charge without fee or re|compence. To this &s;pecies of lawyers, Martial's &s;evere imputation, that <HI>iras &amp; verba locant,</HI> is by no means applicable: it mu&s;t be owned, however, that they are of a kind extremely uncommon.</P>
<P>The &s;overeign's revenue amounts only to about &pound;.300 a year: but, mean as his civil
<PB N="472" REF="482">
li&s;t is, it is &s;till more con&s;iderable than his authority; for he does not po&s;&s;e&s;s the lea&s;t &s;hare of the admini&s;tration. The regency of the town is jointly ve&s;ted in the great and little councils; the former, in which the legi&s;lative power re&s;ides, con&s;i&s;ts of forty members; and the latter, in which the executive is lodged, is com|po&s;ed of twenty-four: the members of each mu&s;t be married men. Both the&s;e councils elect their re&s;pective members; and &s;o far the con&s;titution is entirely ari|&s;tocratical. The burgoma&s;ter is chief of the regency; is cho&s;en by the two councils; and pre&s;ides at their meetings, whenever they are a&s;&s;embled together in their joint capacity. He continues in his office du|ring life; in which, however, he mu&s;t be confirmed annually by the two councils: as are al&s;o the &s;everal magi&s;trates in their re&s;pective po&s;ts. The &s;alaries annexed to the&s;e offices are exceedingly moderate: and, indeed, the general expences of the government are &s;o very &s;mall, that, in proportion to them, its revenues may well be con&s;idered as abundantly ample.</P>
<P>It appears, therefore, that this prote&s;tant republic, notwith&s;tanding the &s;overeignty
<PB N="473" REF="483">
of its catholic bi&s;hop, enjoys in the fulle&s;t extent the power of impo&s;ing taxes, contracting alliances, declaring war and peace; and, in &s;hort, of exerci&s;ing every other act of ab&s;olute and independent legi&s;lation. This &s;ingular con&s;titution is guarantied by Berne, Fribourg, and So|leure, with whom the town is clo&s;ely allied; in con&s;equence of which, it be|comes a member of the Helvetic confe|deracy. And, what is &s;omewhat remark|able, this alliance between tho&s;e cantons and the town of Bienne, is of a &s;uperior nature to that of the &s;ame cantons with the bi&s;hop of Ba&s;il: for, the town enjoys the right of &s;ending deputies to every general diet, ordinary and extraordinary; whereas the bi&s;hop is not allowed the &s;ame privilege.</P>
<P>The language of the country, is a kind of provincial German; but, as the territory borders upon the principality of Neuchatel, the inhabitants &s;peak al&s;o a kind of corrupted French. They are a very active and indu&s;trious people: &s;eve|ral manufactures are e&s;tabli&s;hed in the town, which, con&s;idering its &s;ize, carries on a large trade.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="484">
I have often had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve to you, that the common people of Swi&s;&s;er|land are far more intelligent than the &s;ame rank of men in any other country. Accordingly, I invited my landlord la&s;t night to &s;up with me; and I found him by no means di&s;po&s;ed to be a &s;ilent gue&s;t. He gave me a long account of the cere|mony that was lately performed here, when the citizens did homage to their new bi&s;hop. I was plea&s;ed to hear him expatiate, with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of na|tional pride, upon the beauty and gran|deur of the &s;cene; the magnificence of the proce&s;&s;ion; the number of &s;pectators, as well &s;trangers as natives, who were a&s;&s;embled; together with the entertain|ments and the balls that were given upon that occa&s;ion. By the lofty terms in which he &s;poke of this proce&s;&s;ion, you would have thought, at lea&s;t, that he had been de&s;cribing the coronation of the emperor of Germany, or the king of France: and, in truth, to an inhabitant of Bienne, who&s;e government is admini|&s;tered without the lea&s;t degree of exter|nal pomp, and where luxury has not yet made any progre&s;s; the ceremony

mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have appeared a very &s;trik|ing &s;pectacle. My ho&s;t's narrative recalled to my remembrance the accounts of tho&s;e ancient feudal &s;overeignties, when the great va&s;&s;als of the crown did homage to their liege lord; and, while in <HI>terms</HI> they promi&s;ed him unlimited obedience, main|tained, in <HI>fact,</HI> every e&s;&s;ential of indepen|dence.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t been amu&s;ing my&s;elf in &s;ome plea&s;ant walks, that lie by the &s;ide of the lake, which is here prettily &s;kirted with country hou&s;es. In my way I pa&s;|&s;ed over a plain between the town and the lake, which the &s;overeign council, by a kind of agrarian law, that does ho|nour to the legi&s;lature, allotted long ago, in di&s;tinct portions, to each burgher, for his own particular u&s;e: it is entirely laid out in little neat kitchen-gardens. The general government, indeed, of this mi|niature &s;tate, is well admini&s;tred. It has lately adopted the liberal policy of con|ferring the burgher&s;hip at an ea&s;y rate: a wi&s;e regulation, which cannot fail of encrea&s;ing the population of the town, and extending its commerce.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Soleure, <DATE>October 28.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE road from Bienne to Soleure, lies through a rich and cultivated valley, enclo&s;ed within the Jura moun|tains. The town is plea&s;antly &s;ituated upon the Aar, which here expands its banks, and opens into a broad and fine river, flowing at the foot of &s;ome high and &s;teep hills: the circumjacent country is exceedingly plea&s;ing and diver&s;ified.</P>
<P>I will not exert the privilege of a tra|veller, and tell you, what &s;ome extrava|gant
<PB N="477" REF="487">
antiquarians do not &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ert, that Soleure was built by the patriarch Abraham; but you will have no diffi|culty, perhaps, in believing what others maintain, that it was one of the twelve towns which were de&s;troyed upon the emigration of the original inhabitants into Gaul. But at what time, and upon what occa&s;ion, &s;oever its de&s;truction hap|pened; it appears probable, from a great number of in&s;criptions, medals, and other antiquities, that have been found in the neighbourhood, that it was re|peopled by a Roman colony; and cer|tainly was a Roman fortification, as its antient appellation, <HI>Ca&s;trum Saloduren&s;e,</HI> nece&s;&s;arily implies.</P>
<P>Little more of its hi&s;tory is known, dur|ing that period of ignorance and barba|ri&s;m which &s;ucceeded the downfall of the Roman empire, than that it was &s;acked and de&s;troyed by tho&s;e northern nations, who over-ran the greate&s;t parts of Eu|rope. From the time of its re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, until its admi&s;&s;ion into the Helvetic confederacy in 1481, its &s;tate was &s;imilar to that of many other imperial towns, which acquired a gradual acce&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="478" REF="488">
territory, and after various &s;truggles fi|nally &s;ecured to them&s;elves an ab&s;olute independence.</P>
<P>The canton of Soleure is nearly twelve leagues in length, and &s;even in its great|e&s;t breadth; &s;tretching partly through the plain, and partly along the ridges of the Jura. Its population may amount to be|tween forty and fifty thou&s;and &s;ouls; of which the capital contains about five thou&s;and: all the inhabitants of the canton are catholics.</P>
<P>The government is ari&s;tocratical, upon much the &s;ame plan as that of Lucerne, and of Fribourg: the patrician families are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the public employ|ments. The &s;overeign council con&s;i&s;ts of an hundred and twenty members, in which the &s;enate or council of thirty-five is compri&s;ed: the latter con&s;i&s;ts of two ad|voyers, eleven alt-raths, or &s;enior coun|&s;ellors, and twenty-two jung-raths, or junior coun&s;ellors. Upon the death of one of the alt-raths, the &s;enior of the jung-raths &s;ucceeds to his place; and the vacancy occa&s;ioned by that removal, is filled up by the eleven alt-raths out of the great council. It is from the alt-raths,
<PB N="479" REF="489">
that the four principal magi&s;trates are cho&s;en; namely, the two advoyers, the banneret, and the trea&s;urer: and upon the death of one of the advoyers, the banneret &s;ucceeds to his place of cour&s;e, after having gone through the formality of being nominated by the general a&s;&s;em|bly of the burghers. When a vacancy happens in the great council, it is &s;up|plied by the eleven alt-raths, who al|ways choo&s;e the new member from the &s;ame tribe, or <HI>company</HI> of the citizens to which the la&s;t member belonged. The whole body of burghers a&s;&s;emble every year, and confirm the advoyers and the banneret in their re&s;pective offices: at the &s;ame time the twenty-two jung-raths confirm the eleven alt-raths, who in their turn confirm in the &s;ame manner the former. But all the&s;e &s;everal confirma|tions are matters of mere formality. No per&s;on can be elected into the great coun|cil before he has attained the age of twenty, nor into the &s;enate &s;ooner than twenty-four.</P>
<P>Excepting the trea&s;urer, who is elected by the &s;overeign council; and the advoy|ers and banneret, who are cho&s;en by the
<PB N="480" REF="490">
burghers; all the other public employ|ments are at the di&s;po&s;al of the &s;enate: which body has juri&s;diction likewi&s;e in all civil and criminal cau&s;es, without appeal. The revenues of this government, and the &s;tipends of the numerous places held under it, are, (the circum&s;tances of the&s;e &s;tates con&s;idered) by no means &s;mall: &s;o that the chief families derive from the &s;everal po&s;ts they po&s;&s;e&s;s, very profit|able emoluments.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of this canton is exceedingly fertile, and tho&s;e di&s;tricts which lie within the Jura, abound in excellent pa&s;|tures: but there is a great want of hands for all the purpo&s;es of agriculture; and the defect &s;en&s;ibly encrea&s;es. Neverthe|le&s;s, the ground is &s;o particularly favour|able to corn, that a third part of the yearly produce may be exported, without the lea&s;t detriment to the public. The trade both of the town and of the canton is of little value, although they are very commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated for carrying on an exten&s;ive commerce.</P>
<P>The French emba&s;&s;ador to the Helvetic body re&s;ides in this town, and di&s;tributes from hence tho&s;e annual pen&s;ions or
<PB N="481" REF="491">
&s;ub&s;idies, which the king his ma&s;ter has &s;tipulated by treaty to pay the catholic cantons: they amount to about 30,000 pounds a year. Louis XI. was the fir&s;t French monarch who employed Swi&s;s troops in his &s;ervice, and granted &s;ub&s;i|dies to the &s;tates. The&s;e have &s;ince been con&s;iderably augmented by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: and the perpetual alliance which Fran|cis I. concluded with the Swi&s;s cantons, &s;oon after the battle of Marignano, is con&s;idered as the ba&s;is of every &s;ub&s;equent treaty that has been made between the two contracting powers. Several of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of that king derived con&s;ider|able advantages from the Swi&s;s infantry in their &s;ervice: they aided Henry IV. in e&s;tabli&s;hing him&s;elf upon the throne of his ance&s;tors; and a&s;&s;i&s;ted both Louis XIII. and his &s;on, in the &s;everal wars in which they were engaged. No troops indeed have ever been more ju&s;tly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for their fidelity, their valour, and the excellence of their di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>The la&s;t general alliance between France and the whole Helvetic union, was concluded by Louis the XIVth in 1663, and to remain in force during
<PB N="482" REF="492">
the joint lives of that monarch, and his &s;on the dauphin, and for eight years after the death of either of them. Towards the end of his reign, when that monarch, on account of his &s;on's death, propo&s;ed to renew the alliance in his and his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or's name; the prote&s;tant cantons re|fu&s;ed their con&s;ent: accordingly it was concluded only with the catholic cantons, and the republic of the Vallais.</P>
<P>This alliance differed from the former treaties in &s;ome very e&s;&s;ential articles, particularly, as it &s;tipulated&mdash;that, in ca&s;e the kingdom of France &s;hould be invaded, the Swi&s;s republics in que&s;tion &s;hould permit an additional levy to be rai&s;ed at his maje&s;ty's expence, not exceeding &s;ix|teen thou&s;and men; that in ca&s;e the Hel|vetic body, or any particular canton, &s;hould be attacked by a foreign power, the king engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with as many forces as &s;hould be thought nece&s;|&s;ary; and finally, that if any di&s;&s;en&s;ions &s;hould ari&s;e between the contracting can|tons, his maje&s;ty &s;hould, at the reque&s;t of the aggrieved party, try all gentle me|thods of bringing about a reconciliation; but if the&s;e &s;hould fail, the king agreed,
<PB N="483" REF="493">
both in his own name, and in that of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, to compel the aggre&s;&s;or to abide by the treaties contracted between the cantons and their allies. This la&s;t article &s;eemed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to authorize the interference of the king of France with the politics of Swi&s;&s;erland; and, in that view, appeared dangerous to many of the Swi&s;s, and incon&s;i&s;tent with that ab&s;olute independence, which they had hitherto prized above all other advantages.</P>
<P>The court of France is at pre&s;ent en|deavouring to per&s;uade the prote&s;tant cantons to accede to the alliance, in order that a general treaty may be renewed: and it is expected that a diet will &s;oon be holden at Soleure <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The alliance in que&s;tion was actually concluded at Soleure in May 1777, between the king of France on one &s;ide, and the thirteen cantons and their allies on the other, to continue in force during fifty years. By this treaty it is agreed, that in ca&s;e the kingdom of France &s;hould be invaded, the can|tons and their allies are to furni&s;h an additional levy of &s;ix thou&s;and men; and if the Swi&s;s cantons, or any of their allies, are attacked, the king, if required, engages to &s;end to them, at his own expence, &s;uch &s;uccours as may be thought nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>That article of the treaty concluded with the ca|tholic cantons in 1715, which related to the media|tion of the king of France, in ca&s;e of any di&s;putes ari&s;ing between the thirteen cantons, is very properly and wi&s;ely omitted.</P>
<P>Before this alliance, none of the prote&s;tant &s;tates of Swi&s;&s;erland ever received any pen&s;ions from France: but by the &s;ixteenth article, the prote&s;tants of Glaris and Appenzel, and the town of Bienne, have agreed to accept <HI>les argents de paix et d'alliance,</HI> as the&s;e &s;ub&s;idies are here called.</P></NOTE> for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Ba&s;il, <DATE>November 1.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE road from Soleure to this town, lies through the mid&s;t of the Jura mountains, along the vale of Bal&s;tal, remarkable for its richne&s;s and fertility: and though the country in ge|neral is exceedingly romantic and rocky, yet in many places it is highly cultivated.</P>
<P>I turned a little out of the direct way to this place, in order to view the ruins of <HI>Augu&s;ta Rauricorum,</HI> formerly a large town under the dominion of the Romans; now a &s;mall village in the canton of Ba&s;il,
<PB N="485" REF="495">
clo&s;e to the Rhine. Its ancient remains are very incon&s;iderable, con&s;i&s;ting of a few pillars of marble &s;till &s;tanding, and &s;ome &s;cattered fragments of others, toge|ther with a kind of &s;emicircular range of walls upon a ri&s;ing ground, the greate&s;t part of which has tumbled down, and is almo&s;t entirely overgrown with bru&s;h|wood. From the pre&s;ent appearance of the la&s;t-mentioned ruins, I &s;hould hardly have gue&s;&s;ed that they once compo&s;ed part of a theatre, capable of containing above twelve thou&s;and &s;pectators. But the celebrated Schaefflin has given, in his <HI>Al&s;atia Illu&s;trata,</HI> a particular de&s;cription of this theatre, and its dimen&s;ions; as al&s;o of the temple, to which the marble columns I mentioned, formerly belonged. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are likewi&s;e the re|mains of &s;ome &s;mall aqueducts, which conveyed water to the town from the di&s;|tance of above twelve miles: but none of the&s;e relics of antiquity have any thing &s;o very remarkable in them, as to merit the trouble of a particular vi&s;it.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants, in turning up the ground where the&s;e ruins are &s;ituated, frequently find medals of the Roman emperors, from
<PB N="486" REF="496">
Augu&s;tus to Con&s;tantine; and are become, by repeated experience, able to di&s;tingui&s;h, with &s;ome degree of preci&s;ion, tho&s;e that are rare from the more common ones. I purcha&s;ed of a labourer two medals which he had ju&s;t found; a Trajan and an Al|binus: and though the former was by far the mo&s;t perfect, yet he made me pay three times as much for the latter, becau&s;e he had never &s;een it, he &s;aid, before.</P>
<P>I arrived here the day before ye&s;terday, and, as I had good rea&s;on to be a&s;&s;ured, about twelve at noon; but was much &s;urprized to find, that all the clocks in the town agreed to make me &s;uppo&s;e I was mi&s;taken, and actually &s;truck one: the fact is, that every one of them go an hour fa&s;ter than tho&s;e of the re&s;t of Europe. Different rea&s;ons have been a&s;&s;igned for this &s;ingularity: &s;ome a&s;&s;ert, that it was fir&s;t practi&s;ed during the council of Ba&s;il, in order to a&s;&s;emble the cardinals and bi&s;hops the earlier, who, being a very lazy and indo|lent &s;et of mortals, always came too late. Others tell you, that a con&s;piracy being formed to enter the town at midnight, and to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the magi&s;trates; one of the
<PB N="487" REF="497">
burgoma&s;ters, who had notice of the de|&s;ign, put the town clock an hour for|wards; by which means the con&s;pirators, imagining they had mi&s;&s;ed the appointed time, retired; and that the clocks are &s;till kept forwards, as a perpetual memorial of this happy deliverance. But there is a third rea&s;on given for this &s;trange cu&s;|tom, which &s;eems by far the mo&s;t proba|ble. It is well known that the choirs of cathedrals and churches are con&s;tructed towards the ea&s;t: that of Ba&s;il declines &s;omewhat from this direction; and the &s;un-dial, which is placed upon the out|&s;ide of the choir, and by which the town clock is always regulated, partakes of this declination; a circum&s;tance which, ac|cording to the celebrated Bernouli, occa|&s;ions a variation from the true time of above five and forty minutes.</P>
<P>But whatever may have been the ori|ginal of this whim&s;ical cu&s;tom; the in|habitants of Ba&s;il are &s;o &s;trongly attach|ed to it, that as often as it has been propo&s;ed in the &s;overeign council to have their clocks properly regulated, the motion has con&s;tantly been rejected.
<PB N="488" REF="498">
In reality, the people would think their liberties invaded, if their clocks were to go like the re&s;t of the world's. A few years ago it was &s;ecretly agreed upon by &s;ome of the leading men of the town, to have the &s;un-dial turned half a minute a day, until the &s;hadow &s;hould imperceptibly point to the true hour. This expedient was accordingly put in practice, and the town clock had already lo&s;t near three quarters of an hour, when an accident di&s;covered the plot; and the magi&s;trates were compelled to place the &s;un-dial in the &s;ame po&s;ition it &s;tood before, and to have the town clock regulated by it as u&s;ual. Indeed, long-e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms, however indifferent or ridiculous, are apt to lay &s;o &s;trong a hold upon vulgar minds, as to become &s;ometimes dangerous, and always difficult, to be altered; e&s;pecially among a people, like tho&s;e of this coun|try, who are aver&s;e to any change, even in the minute&s;t articles. I need not re|mind you, how long it was before we could be per&s;uaded, in England, to reckon our years according to the general mode of computation received by the re&s;t of Eu|rope.</P>
<P><PB N="489" REF="499">
Ba&s;il is beautifully &s;ituated upon the banks of the Rhine, near the point where that river (which here becomes very broad, deep, and rapid) after flowing for &s;ome way from ea&s;t to we&s;t, turns &s;ud|denly to the north. It con&s;i&s;ts of two towns joined together by an hand&s;ome bridge; the large&s;t of which towns lies on the &s;ide of Swi&s;&s;erland, and the &s;malle&s;t on the German &s;ide of the ri|ver. It &s;tands very advantageou&s;ly for commerce; and it is an advantage which the inhabitants have by no means neglected: for, they have e&s;tabli&s;hed a great variety of manufactures of all &s;orts; and a very exten&s;ive and lucrative trade is carried on by the principal merchants of the place.</P>
<P>The cathedral is an elegant gothic building, but &s;trangely disfigured by a daubing of ro&s;e-coloured paint &s;pread over the whole edifice. In this cathedral are depo&s;ited, under a marble tomb, the ve|nerable remains of the great Era&s;mus. That di&s;tingui&s;hed writer joined to &s;upe|rior learning, and a peculiar elegance of &s;tyle, the keene&s;t wit, which he pointed, not only again&s;t the vices and ignorance of
<PB N="490" REF="500">
the monks, but the general corruptions and di&s;orders of the church of Rome. He was indeed the forerunner of Luther, in his fir&s;t attacks upon the catholics, re|&s;pecting the &s;ale of indulgences: but af|terwards, when the controver&s;y appeared to be taking a more &s;erious turn, and an open breach with the church of Rome &s;eemed inevitable; he condemned the pro|ceedings of that bold reformer. He con|&s;idered them, indeed, as altogether un|warrantable; and, although he had him|&s;elf cen&s;ured and expo&s;ed the corruptions that infected the catholic religion, yet he zealou&s;ly inculcated &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive obedience to the decrees of what he called the <Q REND="inline">"univer&s;al church."</Q> Agreeably to the&s;e &s;entiments, he advi&s;ed the prote&s;tants to endeavour at obtaining, by mild and pa|tient mea&s;ures, what they might indi&s;|creetly lo&s;e by a warmer and more violent oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Such temperate coun&s;els were ill &s;uited to the daring and impetuous &s;pirit of Luther. Accordingly, while Era&s;mus was acting the part of a mediator, and endeavouring to moderate and allay the flame on each &s;ide, he drew upon him&s;elf the di&s;plea&s;ure of both
<PB N="491" REF="501">
parties: by the one, he was reproached for having gone too far; and by the other for not having gone much farther. In allu&s;ion to this trimming conduct, one of his adver&s;aries, not unaptly, applied to him that line in Virgil,
<Q><L>" Terras inter caelumque volabat."</L></Q>
The impartial truth &s;eems to be, that he was by no means di&s;po&s;ed to become a martyr in the cau&s;e: and the natural timidity of his temper, together with a too great deference to per&s;ons of &s;uperior rank and power; and perhaps al&s;o the fear of lo&s;ing his pen&s;ions; probably entered into the prevailing mo|tives that induced him to take a decided part again&s;t the reformers, and condemn their &s;eparation from the church of Rome as an apo&s;tacy.</P>
<P>But it would be uncandid to impute his conduct wholly to &s;elfi&s;h con&s;idera|tions; &s;omething may fairly be a&s;cribed to the powerful impre&s;&s;ions of early pre|judices; and &s;omething to that rooted love of peace and &s;tudious tranquillity which &s;eems to have been the governing principle of mo&s;t of his actions. But, whatever im|perfections may be di&s;covered in &s;ome par|ticular parts of his character, his memory
<PB N="492" REF="502">
mu&s;t ever be revered by every friend of ge|nius, learning, and moderation. Liveline&s;s of imagination, depth and variety of erudi|tion, together with great &s;agacity of judg|ment, were in him eminently united. He infu&s;ed a &s;pirit of elegance even into theo|logical controver&s;ies; and contributed to di&s;encumber literature of that &s;chola&s;tic jargon with which it was di&s;graced: in a word, he wanted nothing but a little more courage, to have been confe&s;&s;edly one of the fir&s;t characters of the age in which he flouri&s;hed. Era&s;mus reflected much honour upon this town, by choo&s;ing it as the favourite place of his re&s;idence, and publi&s;hing from hence the greate&s;t part of his valuable works. In the pub|lic library are pre&s;erved, with great ve|neration, &s;everal of his letters, and his la&s;t te&s;tament, written with his own hand; as al&s;o his hanger and his &s;eal.</P>
<P>The library contains &s;ome very valu|able manu&s;cripts; the mo&s;t curious of which are tho&s;e relating to the council of Ba&s;il, together with &s;everal volumes of letters written to and from the fir&s;t reformers, and from &s;everal men of let|ters of the fifteenth, &s;ixteenth, and &s;e|venteenth
<PB N="493" REF="503">
centuries. The collection of books, though not very con&s;iderable, is chiefly remarkable for many rare and valuable editions; particularly of tho&s;e which were printed in the fifteenth cen|tury.</P>
<P>In a &s;uite of rooms belonging to this library, is a cabinet of natural curio&s;i|ties; &s;ome antient medals and gems; a few antiquities found at Aug&s;t; a large collection of prints; and &s;ome fine draw|ings and paintings, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of originals by Holbein, who was a native of this town. The&s;e pictures are, mo&s;t of them, in the highe&s;t pre&s;ervation; and what renders them the more valuable is, that the connoi&s;&s;eur can here trace all the different manners of Holbein, and compare the productions of his youth with tho&s;e of his more mature age. The mo&s;t valuable of the&s;e pieces is, the pa&s;|&s;ion of our Saviour, in eight compart|ments: a performance in which this ad|mirable arti&s;t has carried to the highe&s;t perfection that &s;ingular brilliancy of co|louring &s;o peculiar to all his compo&s;i|tions. I was much &s;truck with a profile of his friend and patron Era&s;mus, writ|ing
<PB N="494" REF="504">
his commentary upon St. Matthew: there is a &s;pirit and animation in the countenance, wonderfully expre&s;&s;ive of the great author's &s;agacious and penetrating talents.</P>
<P>The dance of death, in the church-yard of the predicants of the &s;uburbs of St. John, is always &s;hewn to &s;trangers as being of Holbein's pencil. It is painted in oil-colours upon a wall, and guarded by an iron railing: but, as it has &s;everal times been retouched, no traces are di&s;|coverable of that great ma&s;ter's hand. In fact, Mr. Horace Walpole, and other unque&s;tionable judges, have &s;hewn, be|yond a doubt, that it was painted not only before Holbein was born, and as a memorial of the plague which raged at Ba&s;il during the &s;itting of the celebrat|ed council, appointed by Pope Euge|nius IV. in 1431; but that he was not even employed in retouching it. It is probable, however, that, from this an|tient performance, he took the fir&s;t hint towards compo&s;ing his famous drawings of the dance of death.

<P>THE town of Ba&s;il was formerly under the dominion of its bi&s;hops, but their power was gradually dimini&s;h|ed, till at length, and even before the reformation, it was almo&s;t reduced to no|thing. In 1501, the canton joined the Helvetic confederacy, and had the ninth rank a&s;&s;igned to it. From that period the bi&s;hops quitted the town; e&s;tabli&s;hed their re&s;idence at Porentru; and &s;oon intire|ly lo&s;t what little authority and incon&s;i|derable prerogatives remained to them. Upon the introduction of the reforma|tion,
<PB N="498" REF="508">
the con&s;titution was in &s;ome mea|&s;ure changed; the power of the ari&s;to|cracy was much limited, and the govern|ment took a more republican form than before.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem in theory &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to divide the ari&s;tocratical and democra|tical commonwealths into &s;o many diffe|rent &s;pecies as are to be found in Swi&s;|&s;erland: for, in this country, every re|public has its peculiar modification, which di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all others of the &s;ame kind; and there is none more &s;ingular than that of Ba&s;il. To view the general out|lines only of the con&s;titution, it has the appearance of being an ab&s;olute ari&s;to|cracy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An ari&s;tocracy (&s;trictly &s;peaking) means that form of government, which places the &s;upreme power in the nobles, exclu&s;ively of the people; but here I mean by it, the confining of the &s;overeign authority to a certain limited number of per&s;ons, without con&s;idering whether they are patricians or plebeians, nobles or commons: for, at Ba&s;il every ci|tizen who is noble, and who chu&s;es to retain his title of nobility, is excluded from all po&s;&s;ibility of being elected a member of the &s;overeign council.</NOTE>; but, upon con&s;idering it in de|tail, it will be found to incline towards a democracy. The &s;upreme legi&s;lative
<PB N="499" REF="509">
power re&s;ides in the great and little coun|cils, con&s;i&s;ting of about three hundred members: and the authority of the&s;e two councils, combined, is without con|troul. They enact laws, make war and peace, contract alliances, and impo&s;e taxes: they elect the &s;everal magi&s;trates, appoint their own members, nominate to all em|ployments, and confer the right of bur|gher&s;hip. The general admini&s;tration of government is committed by the &s;ove|reign council to the &s;enate, or little coun|cil; that is, to a part of its own body. This &s;enate is compo&s;ed of &s;ixty mem|bers, together with the four chiefs of the republic, two burgoma&s;ters, and two tri|bunes; the&s;e are divided into two bodies, which act by rotation. The acting divi|&s;ion continues in office one year: they decide finally in all criminal cau&s;es; &s;uper|intend the police; and exerci&s;e &s;everal other powers &s;ubordinate to the &s;overeign council. The collective body of citizens a&s;|&s;embles only once a year, when the magi|&s;trates publicly take an oath to maintain the laws, and pre&s;erve the liberties and immunities of the people, inviolate. The
<PB N="500" REF="510">
reciprocal oath of allegiance to the magi|&s;trates, is admini&s;tred to the citizens in their re&s;pective tribes.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the great and boundle&s;s prerogatives of the &s;overeign council; yet the meane&s;t citizen is legally capable of being admitted a member; and, by the &s;ingular method of election, may po&s;&s;ibly be cho&s;en. For, the members of the two councils are drawn from all the &s;everal ranks of citizens, one cla&s;s only excepted, <HI>viz.</HI> the members of the univer&s;ity. The&s;e citizens are divided into eighteen tribes; fifteen of which belong to the larger town, and three to the &s;maller: each of the fir&s;t|mentioned fifteen tribes, returns four members to the &s;enate; and each of the whole eighteen, &s;ends twelve to the great council. Formerly the&s;e elections were determined by a plurality of voices: but, as by this means the riche&s;t candidate was always certain of being cho&s;en; a <HI>ternaire,</HI> as it is called, was e&s;tabli&s;hed; that is, three candidates were put in no|mination, and it was decided by lot which of the three &s;hould &s;ucceed to the vacant po&s;t.</P>
<P>Although this mode of election put a
<PB N="501" REF="511">
&s;top, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to corruption; yet it was not &s;ufficient to counteract entire|ly the influence of the wealthy: and, as the trade&s;men, of whom the greate&s;t part of the &s;overeign council is compo&s;ed, could &s;eldom or never &s;ucceed to the mo&s;t honourable or lucrative employ|ments; they procured an act to be pa&s;&s;|ed, by which the <HI>ternaire</HI> was changed into a <HI>&s;enaire:</HI> that is to &s;ay, &s;ix candi|dates, in&s;tead of three, were put in no|mination, and drew lots for the charge. The names of the&s;e &s;ix are put into one bag; and &s;ix tickets, upon one of which the employment in que&s;tion is written, are put into another. Two per&s;ons are appointed, one to each bag, to be the drawers of this <HI>official</HI> lottery; and the candidate again&s;t who&s;e name the ticket marked with the employment, is drawn, obtains the po&s;t.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious, and indeed too unintere&s;ting, a detail, to enter into a mi|nute account of the forms and circum|&s;tances requi&s;ite to be ob&s;erved in &s;elect|ing the &s;everal candidates to be put in no|mination. To give you, however, &s;ome general idea of this matter:&mdash;Upon a va|cancy
<PB N="502" REF="512">
in the great council, for in&s;tance, the &s;ix per&s;ons who are named for can|didates, mu&s;t be taken from the citizens of that tribe, to which the per&s;on who occa&s;ioned the vacancy belonged; and mu&s;t be nominated by &s;uch of the mem|bers of the &s;overeign council, who are of the &s;ame tribe. The candidates for the &s;enate are, in &s;ome in&s;tances, no|minated by the &s;overeign council at large, and in others, by tho&s;e members only of the &s;overeign council, who belong to the tribe in which the vacancy happens: but in both in&s;tances, the candidates put in nomination mu&s;t be members of the great council. There is but one ca&s;e, in which the <HI>&s;enaire</HI> is not practi&s;ed: for, upon the death of a burgoma&s;ter, one of the tribunes &s;ucceeds of cour&s;e to his of|fice.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem, that a variety of evils mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily flow from this ab&s;urd method of filling up vacant po&s;ts in the govern|ment; as they are left intirely to the ca|pricious di&s;po&s;al of fortune. In fact, it has not unfrequently happened, that a candidate, who&s;e knowledge and abilities rendered him capable of being &s;ervice|able
<PB N="503" REF="513">
to the &s;tate, has never had the good luck to obtain the &s;ucce&s;sful tick|et; while fortune has be&s;towed it upon another by no means qualified to fulfil the duties of the employment. However, notwith&s;tanding the ill ef|fects that occa&s;ionally mu&s;t re&s;ult from this ca&s;ual method of election; the ma|nagement of public affairs is in gene|ral tolerably well conducted; and there are few, if any, in&s;tances of civil ju&s;tice being unwi&s;ely admini&s;tred, or of inno|cence being &s;acrificed to &s;uperior wealth or power.</P>
<P>But it is not the coun&s;ellors of &s;tate and the &s;everal magi&s;trates, that are alone cho|&s;en by lot; even the profe&s;&s;ors in the uni|ver&s;ity are elected in the &s;ame manner. The three candidates, however (for in this in&s;tance the <HI>ternaire</HI> is &s;till in u&s;e) mu&s;t be nominated from among tho&s;e who have taken their doctor's degrees. Hence nothing is more common than to &s;olicit the being cho&s;en one of the candi|dates for the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of a &s;cience, which the party has never made the pe|culiar object of his &s;tudies; if the chair of that particular branch of literature in
<PB N="504" REF="514">
which he excels is already occupied: for, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the re&s;pective unqualified profe&s;&s;ors change places with each other. Thus (to mention an in&s;tance from a family well known to all who are conver&s;ant in mathematical learning) John Bernouli, the famous mathematical pro|fe&s;&s;or in this univer&s;ity, who died in 1748, left two &s;ons, James, and John, (&s;till liv|ing) who are ju&s;tly celebrated for their &s;kill in that &s;cience, in which both their father and grandfather &s;o eminently ex|celled. John, after having been &s;everal times an un&s;ucce&s;sful candidate for dif|ferent profe&s;&s;or&s;hips, was at length cho&s;en by lot profe&s;&s;or of <HI>rhetoric;</HI> but upon his father's death, he changed with Mr. Rum&s;peck, to whom fortune, with her u&s;ual judgment, had thought proper to a&s;&s;ign the chair of mathematics. A &s;i|milar circum&s;tance happened to his bro|ther Daniel: chance conferred upon him the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of <HI>botany</HI> and <HI>anatomy,</HI> which he &s;ome years afterwards had an opportunity of happily exchanging for that of natural philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The &s;umptuary laws are very &s;trict at Ba&s;il: be&s;ides tho&s;e which are common
<PB N="505" REF="515">
to &s;ome other of the Swi&s;s republics; the jealou&s;y of the democratical party has procured additional ones. The u&s;e of coaches in the town is not prohibited here as at Zuric; but, what is more &s;in|gular, no citizen or inhabitant who keeps his carriage, is allowed to have a &s;ervant behind it. Their laws of this kind may perhaps be carried, in &s;ome in|&s;tances, to a &s;crupulous and even ridicu|lous minutene&s;s; upon the whole, how|ever, they are excellent regulations, and not only u&s;eful but nece&s;&s;ary in a &s;mall republic. They have certainly operated with great advantage in this town: for, although it contains &s;everal families who are con&s;iderably rich; yet a happy &s;im|plicity of manners is &s;till &s;o predominant, that you would &s;mile if I were to parti|culari&s;e tho&s;e articles which pa&s;s here un|der the opprobrious denomination of <HI>lux|ury.</HI> And, notwith&s;tanding the neighbour|hood of France, the French modes and fa&s;hions, which are &s;o univer&s;ally &s;pread among the principal inhabitants of Fri|bourg and Soleure, are totally unknown at Ba&s;il.</P>
<P>The lower rank of citizens are in ge|neral
<PB N="506" REF="516">
&s;o &s;trongly prejudiced in favour of their own country, that they &s;eem to be well convinced true felicity is only to be found at Ba&s;il: and indeed that cla&s;s of people are in no part of the world more happy. Every per&s;on boa&s;ts that he is free, and in reality is &s;o: and, as the citizens not only po&s;&s;e&s;s very con&s;iderable privileges and immunities, but each individual may al&s;o indulge the hope of being one day cho&s;en into the &s;overeign council; he en|joys a certain degree of re&s;pect and con|&s;ideration extremely <HI>flattering</HI> to his &s;elf|importance. In fact, there are &s;everal a|mong the magi&s;trates who exerci&s;e the meaner trades; one of the pre&s;ent members of the little council, is a baker. He is indeed a man of di&s;tingui&s;hed knowledge and merit; and has had a chance even of being chief of the republic: for, he has been twice nominated one of the &s;ix candi|dates for the tribune&s;hip of the people.</P>
<P>The conduct of magi&s;trates, is no where more freely, nor more &s;everely, critici&s;ed than at Ba&s;il. The people may &s;ometimes, no doubt, extend this privi|lege beyond its proper limits; but they can never be totally re&s;trained from ex|erci&s;ing
<PB N="507" REF="517">
it, without &s;triking at the vitals of their liberty: it is e&s;&s;ential to its ex|i&s;tence, and no free government can long &s;urvive its extinction.</P>
<P>Ba&s;il is by far the large&s;t, and &s;eems formerly to have been one of the mo&s;t populous, towns of Swi&s;&s;erland: its ex|tent is capable of containing with ea&s;e, above an hundred thou&s;and inhabitants; whereas it can &s;carcely number eleven thou&s;and. Many particular cau&s;es may have concurred to occa&s;ion this remark|able decrea&s;e of people; but I will men|tion only one or two of the general rea|&s;ons to which it may be a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>It is proved, from undoubted calcula|tions, that in all great cities the number of burials exceeds that of births; con&s;e|quently, unle&s;s this unequal proportion of the latter to the former be compen|&s;ated by a con&s;tant acce&s;&s;ion of new in|habitants, every great town in proce&s;s of time mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily become depopulated. Now the citizens of Ba&s;il are &s;o jealous of the right of burgher&s;hip, and pride them&s;elves &s;o much upon the privileges which accompany it, that they &s;eldom deign to confer it upon foreigners: a
<PB N="508" REF="518">
&s;upply therefore to ballance that gradual wa&s;te of people I have mentioned, can never be had by an influx of &s;trangers, where they are not permitted to carry on any commerce, or to follow any trade. A few years ago, indeed, &s;ome of the ma|gi&s;trates, &s;en&s;ible of the impolicy of this unlimited prohibition, procured a law, by which the freedom of the town and the right of burgher&s;hip was allowed to be conferred upon &s;trangers; but it was clogged at the &s;ame time with &s;o many re&s;trictions, as by no means to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for which it was intended. Every principle, indeed, of private intere&s;t and ambition, concurred to prevent its efficacy: and no wonder; for, bodies of men are &s;eldom actuated by &s;o generous a &s;pirit as to &s;acrifice their per&s;onal and immediate advantages, to the future wel|fare and pro&s;perity of their country.</P>

<P>CURIOSITY led me, during my continuance at Ba&s;il, to vi&s;it the ho&s;|pital and burying-ground of St. James, not
<PB N="509" REF="519">
far from the town, and near the &s;mall river Bir&s;ch, celebrated for a mo&s;t remarkable and de&s;perate combat, which was fought in 1444, between the Swi&s;s and the dau|phin of France, afterwards Louis XI: and never was Swi&s;s valour and intrepidity &s;o &s;ignally di&s;played, as by a few battalions of their troops on that memorable day.</P>
<P>This famous battle was in con&s;e|quence of &s;ome di&s;putes, which aro&s;e be|tween the canton of Zuric and tho&s;e of Schweitz and Glaris. The former refu&s;|ing to abide by the mediation of the five neutral cantons, who had decided in fa|vour of the two latter; a civil war en|&s;ued: upon which occa&s;ion, Zuric en|tered into an alliance with the emperor Frederic III. The &s;even la&s;t-mentioned cantons, in order to force the canton of Zuric to renounce this alliance with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, which they ju&s;tly con|&s;idered as an infringement of their league; laid &s;iege to that town. Frederic, unable to &s;end a &s;ufficient body of troops to its relief, applied for additional &s;uccours to Charles VII, king of France; who, as well with a view of di&s;&s;olving the coun|cil of Ba&s;il, as for the particular purpo&s;e
<PB N="510" REF="520">
required, ordered a con&s;iderable army of mercenary troops to march, under the command of his &s;on Louis. Accord|ingly the dauphin entered with his forces into Al&s;ace; and, after laying wa&s;te and harra&s;&s;ing the adjacent provinces, ap|peared before Ba&s;il. Upon this occa|&s;ion, a detachment of fifteen hundred Swi&s;s from the army of the confederates (at that time employed in be&s;ieging Farn&s;|berg) were ordered to throw them&s;elves into the town of Ba&s;il, which was but thinly garri&s;oned.</P>
<P>This handful of men advanced with|out interruption to the plain of Brattelen; where they charged, with &s;uch determin|ed and well-conducted valour, eight thou|&s;and of the enemy's cavalry, that the lat|ter were driven back as far as Mutleez; at which place the repul&s;ed were joined by another corps: but, notwith&s;tanding this reinforcement, the Swi&s;s attacking them again with the &s;ame intrepidity as before, forced them to repa&s;s the river Bir&s;ch; where the main body of the army was chiefly drawn up. Such was the firmne&s;s and &s;olidity of the Swi&s;s in the&s;e &s;everal rencounters, that, to u&s;e
<PB N="511" REF="521">
the expre&s;&s;ion of an old French chronicle, when the cavalry charged <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they could make no more impre&s;&s;ion, than if they had attacked a rock, or an impenetrable wall."</Q> The Swi&s;s, encouraged by this wonderful &s;ucce&s;s, and exa&s;perated with the mo&s;t &s;pirited indignation again&s;t the invaders of their country; di&s;regarding the remon&s;trances of their officers, ra&s;hly attempted to force their pa&s;&s;age over a bridge, which was guarded by a large body of the enemy: but, this effort of incon|&s;iderate valour proving ineffectual, every man of the&s;e gallant &s;oldiers, throwing him&s;elf into the river, where it was ford|able, gained the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, in the face of a battery of cannon that was playing again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But what could the de&s;perate courage of &s;o &s;mall a number of troops avail, again&s;t an army of 30,000 men advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted in an open plain? They had no alternative but either to throw down their arms, or gloriou&s;ly expire with them in their hands. They bravely cho&s;e the lat|ter: accordingly five hundred of them took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;mall i&s;land near the bridge, where, after re&s;olutely defending
<PB N="512" REF="522">
them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity, they were all of them cut to pieces. A like num|ber forced their way through the ranks of the enemy, and were making towards Ba&s;il; when they were oppo&s;ed by a large body of hor&s;e, who were po&s;ted there to prevent the inhabitants of the town from &s;allying out, and coming to the relief of their countrymen. Being now &s;urround|ed on all &s;ides, they threw them&s;elves into the ho&s;pital of St. James; and, lining the walls of the burying-ground, re&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome time the united a&s;&s;aults of the whole French army. At length the ho&s;pital be|ing &s;et on fire, and the cannon having battered down the walls of the burying|ground, they fought no longer in hopes of victory; but &s;till re&s;olving that it &s;hould co&s;t their enemies as dear as po&s;&s;ible, they continued to defend their lives to the la&s;t ga&s;p.</P>
<P>Aeneas Sylvius, (afterwards pope Pi|us II.) relates, among other actions of &s;in|gular valour, exerted by this heroic troop, a particular in&s;tance which I cannot for|bear mentioning. Four of the French attacked a &s;ingle Swi&s;s, and having killed and &s;tripped him, proceeded to in&s;ult the
<PB N="513" REF="523">
dead body; being ob&s;erved by a com|panion of the &s;lain, he &s;eized a battle-ax, ru&s;hed upon the four; killed two of them, and put the others to flight; then fling|ing the dead body of his friend upon his &s;houlders, carried it to a place of &s;ecu|rity; and returning to the attack, was killed.</P>
<P>Of the whole number but &s;ixteen e&s;|caped from the field of battle: and the&s;e, agreeably to the old Spartan di&s;cipline, were branded with infamy, for not hav|ing &s;acrificed their lives in defence of their country. Among tho&s;e who were de&s;pe|rately wounded, and left upon the field of action, thirty-two only were found &s;till alive. The names of many of the&s;e glorious combatants were carefully regi|&s;tered, and &s;till remain upon record.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to a&s;certain the num|ber of forces on both &s;ides in this ever memorable engagement. As far as one can judge, by comparing the &s;everal re|lations of the French and German hi&s;|torians, the army of the dauphin a|mounted at lea&s;t to 30,000. Charles VII. and his &s;on Louis, in their letters to the German princes on this occa&s;ion, re|pre&s;ent
<PB N="514" REF="524">
the total lo&s;s of the Swi&s;s to have been about 3,000: and perhaps that ac|count is not much exaggerated. With re&s;pect to the &s;lain on the &s;ide of the dauphin, the amount is &s;till more uncer|tain: his lo&s;s, however, mu&s;t have been very con&s;iderable, for he remained three days upon the field of battle; and, the better to conceal the number of the killed, he ordered the dead bodies to be &s;ecretly buried in different parts of the neighbour|hood. Add to this, that he was effec|tually prevented from pro&s;ecuting his de|&s;igns upon Swi&s;&s;erland, and compelled to retire with his &s;hattered army into Al&s;ace. That prince him&s;elf, indeed, declared, that &s;uch another victory would ruin his army; and generou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed, that he derived no other advantage from it, than to know and e&s;teem the valour of the Swi&s;s. Accordingly, this combat may be con&s;idered as forming a remarkable aera in the hi&s;tory of the Swi&s;s: for, it gave ri&s;e to their treaty with Charles VII, and was the fir&s;t alliance they ever en|tered into with France.</P>
<P>The war, however, between the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria and Zuric on one &s;ide, and

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING, in the cour&s;e of my for|mer letters, communicated to you &s;uch ob&s;ervations as I was able to make during my tour through Swi&s;&s;erland, con|cerning the laws, government, &s;tate of literature, &amp;c. of each canton in parti|cular; I will now reque&s;t from you the &s;ame candid indulgence I have &s;o re|peatedly experienced, whil&s;t I lay before you a few concluding remarks, in relation to the &s;tate of Swi&s;&s;erland in general.</P>
<P>There is no part of Europe which contains, within the &s;ame extent of re|gion, &s;o many independent common|wealths, and &s;uch a variety of different governments, as are collected together in this remarkable and delightful coun|try; and yet, with &s;uch wi&s;dom was the Helvetic union compo&s;ed, and &s;o little have the Swi&s;s, of late years, been actu|ated with the &s;pirit of conque&s;t, that &s;ince the firm and complete e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of their general confederacy, they have &s;carcely ever had occa&s;ion to employ their arms again&s;t a foreign enemy; and
<PB N="518" REF="528">
have had no ho&s;tile commotions among them&s;elves, that were not &s;oon hap|pily terminated. Perhaps there is not a &s;imilar in&s;tance in antient or modern hi&s;tory, of a warlike people, divided into little independent republics, clo&s;ely bor|dering upon each other, and of cour&s;e having occa&s;ionally interfering intere&s;ts, having continued, during &s;o long a pe|riod, in an almo&s;t uninterrupted &s;tate of tranquillity. And thus, while the &s;everal neighbouring kingdoms have &s;uffered, by turns, all the horrors of internal war, this favoured nation hath enjoyed the fe|licity de&s;cribed by Lucretius, and looked down with &s;ecurity upon the various tem|pe&s;ts that have &s;haken the world around them.</P>
<P>But the happine&s;s of a long peace, has neither broken the &s;pirit, nor ener|vated the arm of this people. The youth are diligently trained to all the martial ex|erci&s;es, &s;uch as running, wre&s;tling, and &s;hooting both with the cro&s;s-bow and the mu&s;ket; a con&s;iderable number of well-di&s;ciplined Swi&s;s troops are always employed in foreign &s;ervices; and the whole people are enrolled, and regularly
<PB N="519" REF="529">
exerci&s;ed in their re&s;pective militia. By the&s;e means they are capable, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, of collecting a very re&s;pectable bo|dy of forces, which could not fail of prov|ing formidable to any enemy who &s;hould invade their country, or attack their liber|ties. Thus, while mo&s;t of the other &s;tates upon the continent are tending more and more towards a military govern|ment, Swi&s;&s;erland alone has no &s;tanding armies; and yet, from the nature of its &s;ituation, from its particular alliances, and from the policy of its internal go|vernment, is more &s;ecure from inva&s;ion than any other European power, and full as able to with&s;tand the greate&s;t force that can be brought again&s;t it.</P>
<P>But the felicity of Swi&s;&s;erland does not con&s;i&s;t merely in being peculiarly ex|empted from the burdens and mi&s;eries of war; there is no country in which hap|pine&s;s and content more univer&s;ally pre|vail among the people. For, whether the government be ari&s;tocratical, demo|cratical, or mixed; ab&s;olute or limited; a general &s;pirit of liberty pervades and actuates the &s;everal con&s;titutions: &s;o that even the oligarchical &s;tates (which, of all
<PB N="520" REF="530">
others, are u&s;ually the mo&s;t tyrannical) are here peculiarly mild; and the pro|perty of the &s;ubject is &s;ecurely guarded again&s;t every kind of violation.</P>
<P>But there is one general defect in their criminal juri&s;prudence, which prevails throughout this country. For, although the Caroline code, as it is &s;tyled, or the code of the Emperor Charles the Vth, forms in each of the republics the princi|pal ba&s;is of their penal laws, with parti|cular modifications and additions in dif|ferent di&s;tricts; yet much too great a la|titude is allowed to the re&s;pective judges, who are le&s;s governed in their determina|tions by this code, or any other written law, than by the common principles of ju&s;tice. How far long experience may have ju&s;tified the prudence of tru&s;ting them with this extraordinary privilege, I cannot &s;ay; but di&s;cretionary powers of this kind, are undoubtedly liable to the mo&s;t alarming abu&s;e, and can never, without the greate&s;t hazard, be committed to the hands of the magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear reflecting, upon this occa&s;ion, on the &s;uperior wi&s;dom, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, as well as in many others,
<PB N="521" REF="531">
of our own mo&s;t invaluable con&s;titution; and indeed, it is impo&s;&s;ible for an Engli&s;h|man to ob&s;erve, in his travels, the govern|ments of other countries, without becoming a warmer and more affectionate admirer of his own. In England, the life and liberty of the &s;ubject does not depend upon the arbitrary deci&s;ion of his judge, but is &s;e|cured by expre&s;s laws, from which no magi&s;trate can depart with impunity. This guarded preci&s;ion, it is true, may occa&s;ionally, perhaps, be attended with &s;ome inconveniences; but they are over|balanced by advantages of &s;o much greater weight as to be &s;carcely percep|tible in the &s;cales of ju&s;tice. I do not mean, however, to throw any imputa|tion upon the officers of criminal juri&s;|diction in Swi&s;&s;erland: as far as I could ob&s;erve, they admini&s;ter di&s;tributive ju&s;|tice with an impartial and equitable hand.</P>
<P>I remarked, with peculiar &s;atisfaction, the excellent &s;tate of the pri&s;ons through|out this country, and the humane pre|cautions which the &s;everal legi&s;latures have taken with re&s;pect to felons: a circum&s;tance which could not fail of
<PB N="522" REF="532">
&s;triking me the more forcibly, as the con|trary is but too vi&s;ible in England. In Swi&s;&s;erland, the criminals are confined in whole&s;ome and &s;eparate wards; and in&s;tead of langui&s;hing long in pri&s;on, to the great injury of their health, or total wa&s;te of their little remnant of money; they are almo&s;t immediately brought to trial. In England, a criminal, or one &s;u&s;pected to be &s;uch, may be confined &s;ix months before his fate &s;hall be determined: and if he happen to be proved innocent, and &s;hould be in low circum&s;tances; the lo&s;s of his time, together with the expences of the gaol-fees, may probably occa&s;ion his utter ruin; while his morals are in no le&s;s danger, by being compelled to a&s;&s;ociate with a &s;et of abandoned wretches, lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, and encouraging each other in their common profligacy. How much is it to be lamented, that, while our code of criminal juri&s;prudence is in general formed upon principles, which di&s;tin|gui&s;h us with honour among the nations of Europe; that our courts of ju&s;tice are thrown open to the view of all the world; and that we enjoy the ine&s;timable and al|mo&s;t peculiar privilege of being tried by
<PB N="523" REF="533">
our equals; how much (I cannot forbear repeating) is it to be lamented, that the &s;ame equitable and humane &s;pirit &s;hould be found wanting in &s;o important an arti|cle of our penal laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a more particular account of the pri&s;ons in Swi&s;&s;erland, the reader is referr'd to a treati&s;e con|cerning <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>The &s;tate of the pri&s;ons in England and Wales, and an account of &s;ome foreign pri&s;ons, by John Howard, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> 1777."</Q> In this treati&s;e (which merits the attention of every friend to humanity) the worthy author has produced many melancholy proofs of the &s;ad &s;tate of the Engli&s;h pri&s;ons, and how very inferior they are to tho&s;e abroad in every cir|cum&s;tance relating to the health and good govern|ment of the unhappy per&s;ons confined in them. And it cannot but afford him the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible &s;atisfaction to find, that his benevolent and per&s;e|vering labours have already been productive of &s;ome very advantageous regulations, particularly concern|ing the fees of pri&s;oners who &s;hall be acquitted, and the prevention of the gaol di&s;temper. As Mr. H. &s;till continues his laudable re&s;earches through all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable pri&s;ons upon the continent, and intends &s;ubmitting the re&s;ult of them to the con&s;ideration of Parliament; it may ju&s;tly be hoped, that he will be rewarded with the happine&s;s of ha|ving become the means of effectually fixing the at|tention of the Briti&s;h Senate upon an object &s;o high|ly de&s;erving the care of every wi&s;e and humane legi|&s;lature.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>One cannot but be a&s;toni&s;hed, as well as concerned, to find, that in a country
<PB N="524" REF="534">
where the true principles of civil govern|ment are &s;o well under&s;tood and &s;o ge|nerally adopted as in Swi&s;&s;erland, that the trial by torture is not yet aboli&s;hed: for, in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, the &s;u&s;|pected criminal is &s;till put to the rack. The inefficacy, no le&s;s than the inhuma|nity, of endeavouring to extort the truth by the &s;everal horrid in&s;truments which too ingenious cruelty has devi&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, has been &s;o often expo&s;ed by the able&s;t writers, that it would be equal|ly impertinent and &s;uperfluous to trouble you with any reflections of mine upon the &s;ubject: and indeed, the whole &s;trength of the &s;everal arguments that have been urged upon this occa&s;ion, is compri&s;ed in the very ju&s;t and pointed ob&s;ervation of the admirable Bruyere, that <HI>la que&s;tion e&s;t une invention merveilleu&s;e &amp; tout-&agrave;-fait &s;&ucirc;re, pour perdre un innocent qui a la complexion foible, &amp; &s;auver un coupable qui e&s;t n&eacute; ro|bu&s;te</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Caracteres, Vol. ii. p. 203.</NOTE>. I cannot, however, but add, in ju&s;tice to the Swi&s;s, that zealous advo|cates have not been wanting among them for the total abolition of torture: but ar|guments
<PB N="525" REF="535">
of rea&s;on, and &s;entiments of hu|manity, have been found, even in this ci|vili&s;ed and enlightened country, to avail little again&s;t inveterate cu&s;tom and long|confirmed prejudices<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Criminal ju&s;tice is here, as in the greate&s;t part of Europe, admini&s;tred agreeably to the rules of the civil law. According to the maxims of that code, the criminal's confe&s;&s;ion is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, in order to his &s;uffering capital puni&s;hment; and con|&s;equently, all tho&s;e nations who have not e&s;tabli&s;h|ed a new code of criminal juri&s;prudence, retain the u&s;e of torture.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent king of Pru&s;&s;ia, it is well known, &s;et the example in Germany, of aboli&s;hing this inhu|man practice; but few, perhaps, are appri&s;ed, that the fir&s;t hint of this reformation was &s;ugge&s;ted to him by reading the Hi&s;tory of England. For, one of the principal arguments in &s;upport of this me|thod of extorting confe&s;&s;ion, being that it affords the be&s;t means of di&s;covering plots again&s;t govern|ment; the &s;agacious monarch remarked, that the Briti&s;h annals fully confuted the fallacy of that rea|&s;oning. Few kingdoms, he ob&s;erved, had abound|ed more in con&s;piracies and rebellions than Eng|land; and yet that the leaders and abettors of them had been more &s;ucce&s;sfully traced and di&s;covered, without the u&s;e of torture, than in any country where it was practi&s;ed. "From thence," added this wi&s;e politician, &s;peaking upon the &s;ubject, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;aw the ab&s;urdity of torture, and aboli&s;hed it accord|ingly."</Q></P>
<P>The above anecdote, which I had from very re|&s;pectable authority, bears the mo&s;t honourable te&s;ti|mony to the efficacy as well as the mildne&s;s of our penal laws, and to the &s;uperior excellency of the proce&s;s ob&s;erved in our courts of criminal ju&s;tice.</P></NOTE>.</P>
