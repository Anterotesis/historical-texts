<HEAD>I. A brief Geographical Account of <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>SCOTLAND</HI> is bounded on the North by the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea and <HI>England,</HI> from which it is divided by <HI>Solway Firth,</HI> and the Rivers <HI>E&s;k</HI> and <HI>Kex&s;op</HI>; on the We&s;t Border, by the <HI>Cheviot</HI> Hills in the <HI>Middle Marches</HI>; and by the lower Parts of the <HI>Tweed,</HI> on the Ea&s;t Border. On the Ea&s;t it is bounded by the <HI>German</HI> Sea; on the North by the <HI>Deucaledonian</HI> Sea; and on the We&s;t, by the great We&s;tern Ocean.</P>
<P>Its greate&s;t Length from <HI>Dung&s;by-head</HI> or <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Grot</HI>'s-<HI>hou&s;e</HI> in <HI>Caithne&s;s,</HI> to the <HI>Mull</HI> of <HI>Gal|loway</HI> towards <HI>Ireland,</HI> is no more than about 215 <HI>Scots</HI> Miles; but if we reckon directly North from
<PB N="3" REF="4">
<HI>Dumfries,</HI> or the &s;aid <HI>Mull</HI> of <HI>Galloway,</HI> to the ut|mo&s;t Parts of <HI>Caithne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>Strathnavern,</HI> the Length will not be &s;o much; and le&s;s &s;till, if we reckon from <HI>Berwick</HI> to either of the&s;e Places.</P>
<P>Its Breadth, from the Point of <HI>Ard-na-murchan</HI> near the I&s;le of <HI>Mull,</HI> about the middle Part of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the We&s;t, to <HI>Buchan-ne&s;s</HI> in the Ea&s;t Parts, towards the North, is about 140 <HI>Scots</HI> Miles; but the Sea running up into the Land, or the Land thru&s;ting out into the Sea in many Places, makes the Breadth of it every-where el&s;e very various and di&s;|proportionable; for in the South Parts it is &s;eldom 100 Miles over, and in the North Parts, beyond <HI>In|verne&s;s,</HI> not &s;o many; &s;o that there is no Hou&s;e above 40 or 45 Miles from &s;alt Water.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the main Land, there are about 300 I&s;lands, &s;ome of them very con&s;iderable, which may be di|&s;tingui&s;hed into &s;everal Cla&s;&s;es: The We&s;tern I&s;lands called <HI>Hebrides,</HI> or <HI>Aebudae,</HI> by <HI>Latin</HI> Authors; the <HI>Orcades,</HI> or <HI>Orkney</HI> I&s;lands: the I&s;lands of <HI>Shetland,</HI> or <HI>Zetland,</HI> and &s;ome few in the Firth of <HI>Forth.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Country abounds in Lakes and Rivers, many whereof running into Creeks and Arms of the Sea, (which in &s;everal Places are very wide and deep) afford great and commodious Opportunities for Fi&s;hing and Shipping: But 'tis much to be regretted, that the Land is neither cultivated, nor the Fi&s;hing and Shipping carried on and improved, to &s;o much Advantage as might be expected.</P>
<P>Tho' the Soil is not generally &s;o level and fruitful as that of <HI>England,</HI> yet the South Parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> are far more plea&s;ant than, and preferable to, the North Parts of <HI>England</HI>; and there are every|where all Things nece&s;&s;ary for human Life: And not only &s;ufficient for the Inhabitants, but al&s;o to export and exchange for &s;uch foreign Commodities as the People want, and to return con&s;iderable Sums.</P>

<HEAD>II. Of the mo&s;t remarkable Lakes and Rivers in <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t remarkable Lakes in <HI>Scotland</HI> are <HI>Loch-tay,</HI> and <HI>Loch-ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Loch-levin:</HI> Which all &s;end forth Rivers of the &s;ame Name with them&s;elves: <HI>Loch-lomond,</HI> which &s;ends forth the River of <HI>Lo|mond</HI>; and <HI>Loch-iern,</HI> which &s;ends the River <HI>Iern.</HI> 'Tis ob&s;erved, that <HI>Loch-ne&s;s, Loch-tay,</HI> and <HI>Loch-iern,</HI> &s;eldom freeze.</P>
<P><HI>Loch-myrton</HI> in <HI>Galloway</HI> is another, and remark|able for this, That one Part of it generally freezes in the Winter-&s;ea&s;on, and the other Part &s;eldom does.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>Loch</HI> in <HI>Straith-errach,</HI> in the Lord <HI>Lovat</HI>'s Lands, which never freezes, however &s;evere the Fro&s;t be, till <HI>February</HI>; and then, in one Night's time, it freezes all over; and if the Fro&s;t continue two Nights, the Ice grows very thick. There is a Lake of the &s;ame Nature call'd <HI>Lochmonar,</HI> in the Earl of <HI>Cromarty</HI>'s Lands in the North; and there is another Lake in <HI>Stragla&s;h,</HI> at a Place call'd <HI>Glencanich,</HI> in a high Ground betwixt the Tops of two Mountains, the middle of which Lake is always frozen through|out the Summer, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trong Re|flexions of the Sun-beams from the Mountains, which melt the Ice at the Sides of the Lake. The Ground round the Lake has a con&s;tant Verdure, as if there were a perpetual Spring; and Cattle grow &s;ooner fat by that Gra&s;s than any-where el&s;e: And this is &s;o much the more remarkable, that there are &s;everal other Lakes in the Neighbourhood, of as high a Situation, wherein no &s;uch thing is &s;een.</P>
<P>In <HI>Linlithgow&s;hire</HI> is a Lake call'd <HI>Loch-coat Lough,</HI> from whence a Stream runs under a neigh|bouring Mountain, the Murmur of which is heard among the Stones; and after it has run thus under
<PB N="5" REF="6">
Ground for about two hundred Paces, it i&s;&s;ues with great Force from a Fountain about three Feet broad, and forms a Stream which turns a Water-mill.</P>
<P>For the Conveniency of Trade and Fi&s;hing, there are &s;o many Inlets of the Sea, that there is &s;carce any Part of it, as I have &s;aid, above 40 Miles di&s;tant from &s;ome Bay, Creek, or Arm of the Ocean; and the&s;e afford many Harbours, &s;everal of them very good, and capable of receiving Men of War, and Ships of the greate&s;t Burden.</P>
<P>The principal Rivers in <HI>Scotland</HI> are TAY, which divides it in the Middle, and running by <HI>Scone, Perth,</HI> and <HI>Dundee,</HI> empties it&s;elf into the <HI>German</HI> Ocean. In the Southern Parts, the FORTH and TWEED run into the &s;ame; CLYDE runs into the We&s;tern Sea; as ESK, ANNAND, NITH, KEN, DEE, and CREE, do into the <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI> In the North, DEE and DON run into the <HI>German</HI> Ocean, as SPEY and NESS do into <HI>Murray</HI> Firth.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t convenient for Trade are TAY, which is navigable to <HI>Perth</HI>; FORTH and CLYDE, which, if join'd by a Canal, near the Place where the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> formerly built their Wall of about 30 Miles long, to defend their Province from the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts,</HI> would open a Communication betwixt the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Seas, to the great Advancement of the Commerce of the whole I&s;land. There was much Talk of it about the Time of the <HI>Union</HI>; but as it would undoubtedly be attended with very great Charges, and other Difficulties, the Project &s;eems to be laid quite a&s;ide.</P>
<P>I am the briefer in my Account of the Lakes and Rivers in <HI>Scotland,</HI> becau&s;e I &s;hall be obliged to be more particular upon them in their re&s;pective Places.</P>

<HEAD>III. Of the Fi&s;heries in <HI>Scotland,</HI> include|ing that of Pearls.</HEAD>
<P>THE Salmon-fi&s;hery is particularly the Boa&s;t and Delight of the <HI>Scots</HI>; in&s;omuch that for it they too much neglect all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Their SALMON are accounted the be&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> and tho' their Barrels be a Third le&s;s than that of <HI>Berwick,</HI> yet they have yielded 10 Livres more <HI>per</HI> Barrel, in <HI>France</HI>; partly becau&s;e of their Goodne&s;s, and partly becau&s;e better cured, wherein the Magi|&s;trates and Town-council of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> take a very particular Care. Salmon abound not only in the navigable Rivers of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but in tho&s;e which are le&s;s, in mo&s;t Parts of the Kingdom; and they valued them &s;o much formerly, that in &s;everal of their old Acts of Parliament they forbad &s;elling them to <HI>England,</HI> except for Gold. <HI>Clyde</HI> abounds with Salmon, for which the Town of <HI>Renfrew</HI> has been famous; and Bi&s;hop <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> in his De&s;cription of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ays, They u&s;ed, in his Time, to em|ploy &s;ixty Ve&s;&s;els in Fi&s;hing mo&s;t of Spring and Sum|mer; but 'tis much &s;hort of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> where the &s;ame Author &s;ays, the Rivers <HI>Dee</HI> and <HI>Don</HI> exceed all tho&s;e of the Kingdom for Number and Goodne&s;s of Salmon: For which he a&s;&s;igns this Rea&s;on, That they delight in clear Streams, which occa&s;ions our Rivers in <HI>Scotland</HI> to abound more with Salmon than tho&s;e of other Countries where the Rivers are more muddy. The other Places, mo&s;t remarkable for Sal|mon-fi&s;hing in <HI>Scotland,</HI> are in the <HI>Dovern</HI> at <HI>Bamf,</HI> the Rivers <HI>Ne&s;&s;e, Nairn, Findorn, Lo&s;&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Spey</HI> in <HI>Murray</HI>; the latter abounds with Salmon for 60 Miles together. <HI>Lochlomond</HI> in <HI>Lenox</HI> is remark|able for Salmon of an excellent Ta&s;te, <HI>Loch-ou</HI> in <HI>Argyll,</HI> the like: And there is good Salmon-fi&s;hing in the Rivers <HI>Lough</HI> and <HI>Speynie</HI> in <HI>Lochaber,</HI> in the
<PB N="7" REF="8">
Bay of <HI>Cromarty,</HI> near <HI>Dingwal</HI> Ca&s;tle, and in the Rivers <HI>Tay</HI> and <HI>Tweed,</HI> and other &s;maller Rivers in the bordering Counties. They have marl'd or &s;peckled Salmon in <HI>Harries, North-vi&s;t</HI> and <HI>Benbecula.</HI> And in the I&s;le of <HI>Sky,</HI> there are no le&s;s than 30 Rivers all abounding with Salmon.</P>
<P>As to their COD-fi&s;hing, Mr. <HI>Spruel</HI> (an eminent <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant, who laid an Account of the Pro|duct of the Kingdom for Trade before their Parlia|ment, &s;ome Years ago) &s;ays, he was inform'd by a <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Man, who u&s;e to buy tho&s;e Fi&s;h and Salt on the <HI>Scots</HI> Coa&s;t, that he has &s;ometimes got four thou&s;and cur'd Fi&s;h in a Voyage, at 1<HI>d.</HI> or 2<HI>d.</HI> apiece, and retail'd them again from 18<HI>d.</HI> to 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> apiece; which &s;hews what va&s;t Advantage might be made of this Trade, &s;ince the <HI>Scots</HI> Cod are reckon'd as good or better than tho&s;e of <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> And what contibutes much to the Cheapne&s;s of this and the Herring-fi&s;hery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is, that they are caught with fewer Hands, and Ve&s;&s;els of far le&s;s Expence, than Doggers, which mu&s;t be well mann'd and &s;trong, becau&s;e oblig'd to lie at Sea; whereas the <HI>Scots</HI> catch tho&s;e Fi&s;h in their own Creeks, Bays and Harbours, where few Hands and open Ve&s;&s;els are for the mo&s;t part &s;ufficient, becau&s;e they are &s;eldom expo&s;ed to any Danger by Storms, being al|ways near the Shore, and laid up at Night.</P>
<P>HERRINGS abound on all the Coa&s;ts of the King|dom, but e&s;pecially on the We&s;tern I&s;les, which are reckon'd the be&s;t and fatte&s;t, tho' not &s;o large as tho&s;e taken on the Ea&s;tern and Northern Coa&s;ts. The <HI>Scots</HI> Herring-fi&s;hing is accounted the be&s;t in the World, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> have got a great Part of their Wealth by it.</P>
<P>A Fi&s;hery was attempted in the I&s;les by King <HI>Charles</HI> I. in Conjunction with &s;ome Merchants; and a Magazine was erected for that U&s;e in <HI>Hermetra,</HI> one of the <HI>Harries</HI> I&s;lands, and another in the I&s;le of
<PB N="8" REF="9">
<HI>Vack&s;ay</HI>; but the unhappy Civil War coming on, it was not pro&s;ecuted. It was renew'd by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and &s;ucceeded well for a Time: The Fi&s;h they caught were accounted the be&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> and yielded a Price accordingly; but the King with|drawing his Money afterwards, to &s;upply his pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ions, the Merchants were di&s;plea&s;ed at it, and differing among them&s;elves, did al&s;o withdraw theirs; which ruin'd the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Dutch</HI> Families &s;ettled in the Village of <HI>Stornway,</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Lewes,</HI> &s;oon after that Prince's Re&s;toration; and &s;o much improved the In|habitants in the Fi&s;hing Trade, during the &s;mall Time of their Abode there, that they &s;till exceed all tho&s;e of the neighbouring I&s;les and Continent; they brought the Natives a great deal of Money likewi&s;e, for their Sea and Land-Fowl: But King <HI>Charles</HI> II. being prevail'd on to &s;end away the <HI>Dutch,</HI> it was a great Lo&s;s to the Country.</P>
<P>Herrings are &s;ometimes bought in the I&s;les for 6<HI>d. per</HI> Barrel, and when cured and &s;ent abroad, yield from 25 to 40<HI>s. per</HI> Barrel; and &s;ometimes 36000 Barrels of white Herrings have been exported to <HI>France</HI> from <HI>Clyde</HI> in a Sea&s;on, be&s;ides what were exported from <HI>Dunbar,</HI> and other Parts of the King|dom, to <HI>France,</HI> and other Nations; which may &s;erve as a Specimen to &s;hew how capable that Trade is of Improvement, e&s;pecially con&s;idering the Situa|tion of the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland</HI> and the I&s;les, from whence they may be a Month &s;ooner at Market with them, than from any Part of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI>; which, with the Advantage of taking and curing them cheaper and &s;ooner than the <HI>Dutch</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly do, con&s;idering how far they have to &s;ail backward and forward, what Ri&s;ques they run at Sea, and what Numbers of Tenders they are obliged to &s;end to and again betwixt their own Country, and their Doggers with Provi&s;ions, Salt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they might &s;oon be out|done
<PB N="9" REF="10">
in that profitable Trade by the Inhabitants of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who may lie a&s;hore at Night, and land their Fi&s;h as &s;oon as caught, without any Dan|ger from Tempe&s;ts or Enemies; many of tho&s;e Bays where the Herring abound, being very &s;afe for Ships to ride in.</P>
<P><HI>Whales</HI> in abundance frequent the I&s;lands of <HI>Flad|den, Orkney</HI> and <HI>Lewes:</HI> One hundred and fourteen run a&s;hore on the I&s;land of <HI>Orkney</HI> at one time, in the Year 1691.</P>
<P><HI>Cod, Tu&s;k,</HI> and <HI>Ling,</HI> are caught in va&s;t Plenty upon all their Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Haddocks, Sturgeon, Turbut, Trouts, Perch, Pike, Scate, Greyberd, Maycril, Keeling, Whiting, Sea-urchin, Cat-fi&s;h, Cockpadle, Lyths, Spirlings, Soles, Flukes, Garvie, Eels,</HI> are al&s;o caught on the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Coa&s;ts in great Plenty, for Home-con&s;umption.</P>
<P><HI>Otters,</HI> who&s;e Skins are u&s;eful for Muffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are very numerous in the I&s;les.</P>
<P>Shell-fi&s;h of all &s;orts, as <HI>Lob&s;ters, Crabs, Oy&s;ters,</HI> are al&s;o found in va&s;t Quantities in the We&s;tern I&s;lands; the latter &s;o large, that they mu&s;t be cut in three or four Pieces, to be eaten.</P>
<P><HI>Cockles, Mu&s;cles, Limpets, Wilks, Scollops,</HI> and <HI>Spouts,</HI> are ca&s;t up by the Tide in &s;uch Numbers on the I&s;les, that the People cannot con&s;ume them.</P>
<P>PEARL being the Product of Fi&s;h, it is proper to di&s;cour&s;e of the <HI>Scots</HI> Pearl here. Mr. <HI>Spruel,</HI> the Merchant above-mentioned, who under&s;tood the Pearl-trade be&s;t of any Man in that Kingdom, having dealt in it above forty Years, &s;ays, He has &s;ometimes given a hundred Rixdollars, which is near 25<HI>l.</HI> for one <HI>Scots</HI> Pearl; and that he had <HI>Scots</HI> Pearl as fine, clear, and more tran&s;parent, than any Oriental Pearl. Tho' the latter be more ea&s;ily match'd, becau&s;e they are all of a yellow Water, yet Foreigners covet <HI>Scots</HI> Pearl. The more Wrinkles there are in a Pearl-&s;hell, the more Sign it is of the
<PB N="10" REF="11">
Age and Goodne&s;s of a Pearl; for the &s;mooth Shells are young and barren: Therefore he propo&s;ed, that a Law &s;hould be made to forbid the Fi&s;hing of young Pearl; for the longer they &s;tay in the Water, the more valuable they are: So that he would have no Shells taken up le&s;s than four Inches in Length, or two or three in Breadth; and that none &s;hould be allowed to offer any Pearl to be &s;old, that weighs le&s;s than five Grains; which is as rea&s;onable as Laws to prevent the taking of the young Fry of Salmon, &s;ince Pearl are of much more Value. And that they might have Time to grow and increa&s;e, he propo&s;es, That Pearl-fi&s;hing &s;hould be forbid, except once in ten Years at lea&s;t; becau&s;e he has been &s;orry to &s;ee &s;ome Thou&s;ands of young Pearls offer'd to Sale, that were of no manner of Value; whereas, had they lain in the Waters their due Time, they might have been worth from four to fifty Crowns apiece.</P>
<P>Pearl is found in mo&s;t Places of the Nation where Salmon are taken; and once in twenty Years, he &s;ays, there is a great Pearl-fi&s;hing in <HI>Scotland.</HI> This does not hinder, but that Pearl-&s;hells of the Size he propo&s;es, or larger, may be taken up at any time when found; and the&s;e are probably to be had among the unfrequented I&s;les.</P>
<P>Particular Places where Pearl abound, are the Rivers in the I&s;le of <HI>Skye,</HI> where they are frequently found in black Mu&s;cles, e&s;pecially in the Rivers <HI>Kilmartin</HI> and <HI>Ord,</HI> where Pearls have lately been found of 20<HI>l. per</HI> Piece; and in a fre&s;h-water Lake near the South-&s;ide of <HI>Loch-einard&s;tad.</HI> In that &s;ame I&s;land there are al&s;o Mu&s;cles that breed Pearl.</P>
<P>Tho' the &s;mall Pearl be not &s;o u&s;eful for Orna|ment, yet they may be of very good U&s;e in Phy&s;ick, and make a fine Article in the Apothecary's Bills, being reputed the chief of all Cordials, and very good again&s;t the Plague, violent and pe&s;tilential Fe|vers, Fluxes, Heart-burning, Giddine&s;s of the Head,
<PB N="11" REF="12">
Trembling of the Heart, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that the Pearl-fi&s;hery well de&s;erves Encourage|ment, &s;ince we may be &s;upply'd with it much cheaper at Home, than from the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="account">
<HEAD>IV. Of the Cattle, Hor&s;es, Fowls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Country in general abounds in Flocks of Sheep, and Herds of Cattle; which are gene|rally black, except in Corn-&s;oils, where they &s;el|dom breed or keep any more than are nece&s;&s;ary for the Plough or the Pail. But 'tis ob&s;ervable, that &s;uch as are bred in the Corn-countries, are much larger than tho&s;e bred in other Parts, and equal in Size to tho&s;e bred in &s;ome Parts of <HI>England,</HI> even where the Land &s;eems to be better.</P>
<P>In general, their Sheep and Cattle are much &s;maller than tho&s;e of <HI>England,</HI> e&s;pecially in Pa&s;ture-lands; yet are they of a far &s;weeter and more de|licious Ta&s;te. The <HI>Highlanders</HI> bring great Num|bers of them yearly into the Lowlands, where &s;ome are fatted; but the Bulk of them, and al&s;o many of tho&s;e bred in the Lowlands, are &s;ent into divers Parts of <HI>England,</HI> e&s;pecially to <HI>St. Faith's</HI> near <HI>Nor|wich,</HI> where they turn out to good Account; as I have ob&s;erved in its Place.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o very many <HI>Hogs,</HI> and an in|credible Number of <HI>Goats,</HI> particularly in the North and Highlands; the latter they eat them&s;elves, but the former they pickle and export, as they likewi&s;e do va&s;t Quantities of <HI>&s;alt Beef.</HI></P>
<P>In the Southern Counties there are no <HI>Deer,</HI> ex|cept in Gentlemens Parks; but every-where el&s;e, they are in great Plenty.</P>
<P>They breed great Numbers of <HI>Hor&s;es,</HI> e&s;pecially in <HI>Galloway</HI> and the <HI>Highlands</HI>; &s;mall indeed, but capable of great Fatigue, e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider,

that they are not only more proper for the Saddle, and other U&s;es in that Country, which, being hilly, will not admit, in many Places, of Teams and Carriages; but are more hardy than Hor&s;es of a larger Size, and will thrive upon what would &s;tarve great Hor&s;es. Neverthele&s;s, in many Places of the <HI>Lowlands</HI> they can breed Hor&s;es fit for War, Coach, or Carriage.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> has not only Plenty of <HI>dome&s;tick Fowl,</HI> &s;uch as are common to other Countries; but many that are peculiar to them&s;elves, e&s;pecially in the I&s;lands, where they are in &s;uch Multitudes as the Inhabitants can neither con&s;ume nor vend half of them; but their Trade for them will &s;till increa&s;e, as it has done &s;ince the <HI>Union.</HI></P>

To the Stones of the upper Well grows a Matter re&s;embling &s;tinking Sul|phur of Antimony, of a yellowi&s;h red Colour; the Stones of the lower Well are of the Colour of An|timony, and &s;ome of them contain a metallick Mat|ter, that &s;parkles like Antimony. Where the Stream of the lower Well runs down into a neighbouring Brook, there &s;ticks to the Rock a whiti&s;h Salt, and perhaps a nitrous Matter, which has the diuretick Virtue of the Water. Tho&s;e Waters al&s;o purge by Stool and Vomit, and are very good again&s;t Colick and Nephritick Pains, becau&s;e they powerfully re|move

<HEAD>X. Of the Cu&s;toms, Manners, Language, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the <HI>Scots.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> are divided into HIGHLANDERS, who call them&s;elves the antient <HI>Scots</HI>; and into LOWLANDERS, who are a Mixture of antient <HI>Scots, Picts, Britons, French, Engli&s;h, Danes, Germans, Hungarians,</HI> and others.</P>
<P><HI>Buchanan</HI> de&s;cribes the Cu&s;toms of the <HI>High|landers</HI> graphically thus: In their Diet, Apparel, and Hou&s;hold-furniture they follow the Par&s;imony of the Ancients; they provide their Diet by Fi&s;hing and Hunting, and boil their Fle&s;h in the Paunch or Skin of a Bea&s;t: While they hunt, they eat it raw, after having &s;queez'd out the Blood. Their Drink is the Broth of boil'd Meat, or Whey they keep &s;ome Years, and drink it plentifully in their Enter|tainments; but mo&s;t of them drink Water. Their Bread is of <HI>Oats</HI> and <HI>Barley,</HI> the only Grain pro|duced in their Country, which they prepare very artfully: They eat a little of it in the Morning, and contenting them&s;elves with that, hunt, or go about their Bu&s;ine&s;s without eating any more till Night. They delight mo&s;t in Cloaths of &s;everal Colours, e&s;pecially &s;trip'd; the Colours they affect mo&s;t, are Purple and Blue. Their Ance&s;tors, as do mo&s;t of them &s;till, made u&s;e of Plaids very much variegated; but now they make them rather of dark Colours, re&s;embling that of the Crops of Heath, that they may not be di&s;covered while they lie in the Heaths waiting for their Game. Being rather wrapped up than co|vered with tho&s;e Plaids, they endure all the Rigours of the Sea&s;ons, and &s;ometimes &s;leep covered all over
<PB N="21" REF="22">
with Snow. At Home they lie upon the Ground, having under them Fern or Heath (covered with a Sheet or Blanket); the latter laid with the Roots undermo&s;t, &s;o as it is almo&s;t equal to Feathers for Softne&s;s, but much more healthful; for the Quality of Heath being to draw out &s;uperfluous Humours, when they lie down weary and faint upon it at Night, they ri&s;e fre&s;h and vigorous in the Morning. They affect this hard way of &s;leeping; and if at any time they come into other Places of the Country, where there is better Accommodation, they pull the Coverings off the Bed, and lie down upon them wrapped in their Plaids, le&s;t they &s;hould be &s;poiled by this barbarous Effeminacy, as they call it.</P>
<P>The LOWLANDERS partake much of the Temper of the People, of whom we have mentioned them to be compo&s;ed, but mo&s;t re&s;emble the <HI>French,</HI> oc|ca&s;ioned by the long League betwixt the two Na|tions, their mutual Commerce, frequent Intermar|riages, and Cu&s;tom of travelling into <HI>France</HI> to &s;tudy the Law, and other Sciences, and by their affecting to &s;erve in the <HI>French</HI> Armies.

<P>THE <HI>E&s;tabi&s;hed Religion</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ince the Revolution, and confirmed by the Act of <HI>Union,</HI> is what is called <HI>The Pre&s;byterian</HI>; being a Church Government by <HI>Pa&s;tors, Teachers, Elders,</HI> and <HI>Deacons.</HI> Before the Revolution, the Church was govern'd by Bi&s;hops; but they not coming &s;o readily into the new Settlement, as the Pre&s;byterians did, were aboli&s;hed.</P>

Here are tried Appeals from the Kirk Se&s;&s;ions; and here they in|&s;pect into the Behaviour of the Mini&s;ters and Elders within their re&s;pective Bounds. They &s;upply vacant Pari&s;hes, ordain Pa&s;tors, examine and licen&s;e School-ma&s;ters, and young Students, for probationary Preachers; and judge when, or on whom, to inflict the greater Excommunication.</ITEM>

For it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that Epi&s;copacy in <HI>Scotland</HI> dif|fered from the &s;ame Thing in <HI>England</HI>; for here it was as low as the Nature of an Epi&s;copal Church could admit.

<HEAD>XII. Of the Order of the <HI>Thi&s;tle,</HI> or St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Order of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> or the <HI>Thi&s;tle,</HI> by rea&s;on of its great Antiquity, and memorable In&s;titution, is, upon all Occa&s;ions, called, <HI>The mo&s;t Antient and mo&s;t Noble Order of the Thi&s;tle,</HI> being founded, as all the <HI>Scots</HI> Hi&s;torians a&s;&s;ert, by <HI>Achaius</HI> the 65th King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> after a &s;ignal Victory obtained over the <HI>Saxons, Anno</HI> 819. and dedicated to St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> the Patron or tutelar Saint of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This Order came at length to &s;hine forth in fuller Splendor in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> V. who was him&s;elf a mo&s;t &s;plendid and magnificent Prince.

<P>Her late Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Anne</HI> was plea&s;ed to re|vive the &s;aid Order upon the 31&s;t of <HI>December</HI> 1703. and &s;igned a Body of Statutes, wherein the Colour

The <HI>Scots</HI> are as diligent, as indu&s;trious, as apt for Labour and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and as capable of it, when they are Abroad, as any People in the World; and why &s;hould they not be &s;o at Home?

<HEAD>LETTER II. CONTAINING A De&s;cription of the <HI>Mer&s;e,</HI> the Two <HI>Lothians,</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh, Leith,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I AM ju&s;t now entered <HI>Scotland</HI> by the ordinary Way of <HI>Berwick,</HI> which &s;tands on the North Side of the River <HI>Tweed,</HI> and has a Bridge by which it is joined to <HI>Northumberland.</HI> It was originally a <HI>Scots</HI> Town, and is to this Day no Part of <HI>England</HI>; but has divers di&s;tinct Cu&s;toms and Privileges, and is mentioned in all Statutes and Pro|clamations as a Place or Liberty of it&s;elf, di&s;tinct from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales.</HI> It was formerly the chief Town of the <HI>Mer&s;e,</HI> which to this Day is called the Shire of <HI>Berwick.</HI> It was often taken from, and retaken by the <HI>Scots</HI>; but the la&s;t time it fell into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hands, which was long before the Union of the Two Crowns in the Per&s;on of King <HI>James</HI> VI. they fortified it more &s;trongly than it had been formerly, and manned it with a &s;ufficient Gari&s;on, &s;o that all the Attempts of the <HI>Scots</HI> to regain it afterwards, proved ineffectual. It is a Place of no extraordinary
<PB N="43" REF="44">
Trade, tho' a great Thorough-fare. It has but one Church, which is under the Juri&s;diction of the Bi&s;hop, and in the Gift of the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as we get out of the Town, we enter on <HI>Scots</HI> Ground, tho', in Times of War, it u&s;ed to be part of what was called <HI>Debateable Land,</HI> and on that Account but thinly inhabited; for the Borderers of each Kingdom often made Inroads on one another, notwith&s;tanding that a great Number of Men, at an incredible Trouble and Expence, kept Watch every Night; be&s;ides which, there were Watch-towers all along the Borders at proper Di&s;tances, and &s;everal Laws relating to the Borders made by Commi&s;&s;ioners from both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing we ob&s;erved was the Sea on the Right-hand, and the River <HI>Tweed,</HI> which fetches a Reach Northward, on the Left. The Land between lies &s;o high, that in &s;tormy Weather 'tis very bleak and unplea&s;ant, having little or no Shelter: How|ever, the Land, compared to what we left in <HI>Northum|berland,</HI> or what we &s;oon found farther in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is good.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Town in <HI>Scotland</HI> is <HI>Mordington,</HI> a poor &s;orry Village; yet gives the Title of Lord to a Branch of the noble Family of <HI>Douglas.</HI> The pre&s;ent Lord lives in <HI>England,</HI> and is &s;o well known, that I need &s;ay no more of him.</P>
<P>From the Brow of a very high and &s;teep Hill, we had a large View into <HI>Scotland</HI>; but we were wel|comed to it by &s;uch a Gu&s;t of Wind, that it obliged us to quit our Hor&s;es in real Apprehen&s;ion of being blown off; be&s;ides, the Wind blowing full North, and the Road turning toward the &s;ame Quarter, it blew directly in our Faces. I can truly &s;ay, I never was &s;en&s;ible of &s;o exceeding keen and &s;harp a Cold; for it pierced our very Eyes, &s;o that we could &s;carcely keep them open.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45">When we went down the Hill, the fir&s;t Town we came to is almo&s;t as perfectly <HI>Scots,</HI> as if you were an hundred Miles North of <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; and there is very little Appearance of any thing <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there, either in Cu&s;toms, Habits, U&s;ages of the People, or in their way of Living, Eating, or Behaviour. And there are very few <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Familes to be found among them.</P>
<P>On the contrary, you have in <HI>England</HI> abundance of <HI>Scots</HI> Men, <HI>Scots</HI> Cu&s;toms, Words, Habits, and U&s;ages; nay, even the Buildings in the Towns and Villages all over <HI>Northumberland</HI> imitate the <HI>Scots</HI>; witne&s;s their building their Hou&s;es with the Stairs going up to the &s;econd Story on the Out&s;ide of the Hou&s;e, that one Family may live below, and an|other above, without going in at the &s;ame Door (which is the <HI>Scots</HI> way of Living); as you may &s;ee in <HI>Alnwick, Wirkworth,</HI> and &s;everal other Towns; witne&s;s al&s;o their &s;etting their Corn in great Numbers of &s;mall Stacks without Doors, not making u&s;e of Barns, but only a particular Building, which they call a Barn, tho' no more than a Thre&s;hing-floor, into which they rake one of the&s;e &s;mall Stacks at a time, and thre&s;h it out.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Town is called <HI>Ayton,</HI> from the &s;mall River <HI>Ay,</HI> on who&s;e Bank it &s;tands. The Church was ruin|ous, and quite de&s;titute of a Roof. The Heritors being of different Opinions, contributed not a little to the Dilapidation. Such as were epi&s;copally inclined were very backward in contributing their Share, and the Pre&s;byterians thought it hard the Whole &s;hould lie upon them; &s;o that, between the two, the Roof fell to the Ground. However, the Mini&s;ter preached in a Barn to the Generality of the Pari&s;hioners, and &s;uch as were otherwi&s;e inclined, heard Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters in the Hou&s;es of &s;ome of the neighbouring Gentry.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">About Three Miles farther Ea&s;t is a &s;mall Harbour, with a Town called <HI>Eymouth, Aymouth,</HI> or <HI>Haymouth,</HI> where a Fort was formerly rai&s;ed to curb the Gari&s;on of <HI>Berwick.</HI> This Town gave Title of Baron to the late Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>; but the Patent being granted only to him, and the Heirs-male of his own Body, the Honour extingui&s;hed with him. It is a good Fi&s;hing-town, and affords a good Harbour for Fi&s;hing-ve&s;&s;els. In Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, the <HI>French</HI> held it, and fortified it, as it was the fir&s;t Port in <HI>Scotland</HI> they could &s;afely land their Supplies at, for the Queen-mother; but they were obliged to quit that, and the Kingdom, &s;ome time after, by a Treaty, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> &s;upporting the Reformers again&s;t her.</P>
<P>From this Bridge we enter upon a mo&s;t de&s;olate, and, in Winter, frightful Moor for Travellers, e&s;pe|cially Strangers, called <HI>Coldingham Moor,</HI> upon which, for about Eight Miles, you hardly &s;ee a Hedge or a Tree, and you meet with but one Hou&s;e all the Way, and that not a Hou&s;e of Entertainment.</P>
<P><HI>Coldingham,</HI> whence this Moor derives its Name, was an old Mona&s;tery, built by <HI>Edgar,</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> about the Year 1100, and famous for its Lady Abbe&s;s <HI>Ebba,</HI> of whom they tell us the follow|ing Story.</P>
<P>This Lady was the Daughter of <HI>Edelfred,</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland</HI>; and, when her Father was taken Pri&s;oner by the Pagan <HI>Mercians,</HI> &s;he got into a Boat in the <HI>Humber,</HI> with three other Women, and, by their own Prayers only, were miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved, and carried as far as <HI>Scotland,</HI> where, under a Pro|montory, they were driven on Shore by a Storm, and their Boat da&s;hed in Pieces.</P>
<P>When they got a&s;hore, they laboured with their Hands, and made them&s;elves a little Hut to lodge in; they continued their religious way of Living, and the Country People &s;u&s;tained them with Food; till at
<PB N="46" REF="47">
length, acquiring a great Character by their San|ctity and Au&s;terity, they were addre&s;&s;ed to far and near for their Prayers; and, by the Charity of the People, got enough to build a religious Hou&s;e at <HI>Coldingham.</HI></P>
<P>Here, as Fame &s;ays, when the cruel <HI>Danes</HI> came on Shore, the religious Lady (who, it &s;eems, was very beautiful too!) cut off her No&s;e and upper Lip, and made all her Nuns do the &s;ame, in order to pre|&s;erve their Cha&s;tity. Whereupon the barbarous <HI>Danes,</HI> enraged at their Zeal, fired their Nunnery, and burnt them all alive. From this Lady, who, it is &s;aid, was &s;ainted for the&s;e Sufferings, the Promontory where &s;he landed is to this Day called <HI>St. Ebbe's Head,</HI> and vulgarly, by our Sailors, <HI>St. Tabbe's.</HI> There was once, upon the Point of this Promontory, a &s;trong Fort called <HI>Fa&s;t-ca&s;tle,</HI> belonging to the Earl of <HI>Hume</HI>; but it has been &s;ome time demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>A little to the North-we&s;t is the Town and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Duns,</HI> remarkable for the Birth of <HI>John Duns Scotus, Anno</HI> 1274. &s;ome of who&s;e Family are &s;till in Being there. He was a Frier Minor, and the greate&s;t Scholar of his Age. <HI>Scaliger</HI> &s;ays, there was nothing his Genius was not capable of. But his chief Study was in Points more nice than nece&s;&s;ary, whereupon he was called <HI>Doctor Subtilis.</HI> His Fol|lowers, called <HI>Scoti&s;ts,</HI> were great Oppo&s;ers of the <HI>Thomi&s;ts,</HI> another Set of Schola&s;ticks, &s;o named from <HI>Thomas Aquinas.</HI> He &s;tudied at <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> and died of an Apoplexy at <HI>Cologn.</HI> After <HI>Berwick</HI> was taken by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the Sheriff-Court was kept here, which was but lately removed to a Mar|ket-town, called <HI>Greenlow</HI>; which is al&s;o a Royal Burgh, and the principal in the Shire, belonging to the Earl of <HI>Marchmont.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Duns</HI> was al&s;o remarkable for the Encampment of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Army, under General <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> a&s;&s;embled to oppo&s;e King <HI>Charles</HI> I. when he came to the
<PB N="47" REF="48">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Borders with an Army, to <HI>per&s;uade</HI> that Kingdom to Obedience. It has the be&s;t weekly Market for Cattle in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is a Place of the be&s;t Trade in this County.</P>
<P><HI>Cold&s;tream</HI> is al&s;o a Market-town, in this County of <HI>Mer&s;e,</HI> where was antiently an Abbey. <HI>Eccles</HI> likewi&s;e had another: and <HI>Er&s;ilton</HI> is noted for the Birth-place of the Rhyming Poet <HI>Lermouth,</HI> &s;o much admired by the Vulgar <HI>Scots. Hume</HI> was formerly the Re&s;idence of the Earls of that Name, which they derived from the Town, and they had a &s;trong Ca&s;tle there, now demoli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>The incon&s;iderate Vanity of the ancient <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Gentry and Nobility, of deriving their Names from the Places of their Re&s;idence, had this Inconvenience attending it, that in a few Generations, it lo&s;t the old Name of the Family from which the&s;e <HI>Changelings</HI> (may I, without Affront, call them?) de&s;cended. Thus the <HI>Dunbars</HI> and <HI>Humes,</HI> originally the &s;ame, came to be thought two di&s;tinct ones. In like man|ner, the <HI>Gordons, Swintons, Ridpaths, Ni&s;bets,</HI> and the <HI>Spot&s;woods,</HI> as &s;ome &s;ay, tho' all of the &s;ame Original, mu&s;t have lo&s;t the Knowledge of it, had it not been for Tradition, or the Armorial Bearings of the &s;everal Families, which be&s;peak them to be of the &s;ame Lineage. This Hint may &s;erve once for all, as to tho&s;e Families called of <HI>that Ilk</HI>; <HI>i. e.</HI> who&s;e Surname and paternal E&s;tate, are the &s;ame, and are generally e&s;teemed ancient and honourable.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Mer&s;e,</HI> or <HI>March,</HI> formerly gave Title of Earls of <HI>March,</HI> to the Family of <HI>Dunbar,</HI> who, according to <HI>Camden,</HI> derived their Origin from the famous <HI>Go&s;patrick,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who retired into <HI>Scotland</HI> on the <HI>Norman</HI> Conque&s;t, and was honoured with the Earldom of <HI>March,</HI> and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Dunbar,</HI> by the then King <HI>Malcolm Can|more,</HI> whence his Po&s;terity took the Name; while another Branch, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Barony of
<PB N="48" REF="49">
<HI>Hume,</HI> a&s;&s;umed that for their Surname, which they &s;till retain. <HI>George de Dunbar</HI> being pro&s;cribed in the Reign of <HI>James</HI> I. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Title of Earl of <HI>March</HI> was conferred on the Duke of <HI>Albany,</HI> then on the Family of <HI>Stewart</HI> and <HI>Lenox</HI>; which being extinct, King <HI>William</HI> III. conferred it on <HI>William Douglas,</HI> Brother of the Duke of <HI>Queen&s;|bury,</HI> who&s;e Son now enjoys it.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed over <HI>Coldingham Moor,</HI> called al&s;o <HI>Lambermoor,</HI> the Lowlands of <HI>Ea&s;t-Lothian</HI> &s;hew them&s;elves from the Top of a &s;teep Hill, and give a Pro&s;pect of a fruitful and plea&s;ant Country. As &s;oon as we come down the Hill, there is a Village, called <HI>Cockburn&s;path,</HI> or <HI>Cobber&s;path,</HI> where Nature forms a very &s;teep and difficult Pa&s;s, and where a thou&s;and Men well armed, and boldly doing their Duty, could keep out a very great Army, if there was occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>The next Shire is that of <HI>Ea&s;t-Lothian</HI>; and the fir&s;t Hou&s;e of any Note we met with in it, was that of <HI>Dungla&s;s,</HI> the Seat of Sir <HI>James Hall.</HI> We began here to &s;ee, that <HI>Scotland</HI> was not naturally &s;o barren, as &s;ome People repre&s;ent it; but might be made equal even to the riche&s;t, mo&s;t fruitful, mo&s;t plea&s;ant, and be&s;t improved Part of <HI>England,</HI> if the <HI>Scots</HI> had the &s;ame Methods of doing it, and were as good Hu&s;bandmen, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; and this might ea&s;ily be brought to pa&s;s, would the Gentry &s;et about it, as this Gentleman has, in part, already done.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Soil hereabout is very good, and the Sea-ware, as they call the Weeds which the Sea ca&s;ts up, abundantly &s;upplies the Defect of Marl, Chalk, or Lime-&s;tone; for by laying this continually on the Land, they plough every Year, without letting it lie fallow, as we do; and I found they had as much Corn, as our Ploughmen expre&s;s it, as could &s;tand upon the Ground.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50">The next Town of Note is <HI>Dunbar,</HI> a Royal Burgh, which, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is much the &s;ame with what we call a Corporation in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ends Members to Parliament in like manner; only, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the&s;e Burghs have &s;ome particular Privileges &s;eparate to them&s;elves; as that, for Example, of holding a Sort of Parliament, called a <HI>Convention of Burghs,</HI> a Method taken from the Union of the <HI>Hans Towns</HI> in the North, in which they meet and concert Mea&s;ures for the publick Good of the Towns, and of their Trade, and make By-laws, or Acts and Declarations, which bind the whole Body. Not have they lo&s;t this Privilege by the Union with <HI>Eng|land,</HI> but it is pre&s;erved entire, and is now many ways more advantageous to them than it was before, as their Trade is like to be, in time, more con|&s;iderable. But this I have taken notice of in an|other Place.</P>
<P>This Town of <HI>Dunbar</HI> is a hand&s;ome well-built Town, &s;ituated in the Mouth of the River <HI>Forth,</HI> on the South-&s;ide towards the <HI>German</HI> Ocean. It is a very con&s;iderable Port, and of great Advantage to all Ships in the River, in ca&s;e of Stre&s;s of Weather; but yet its Entrance was &s;o difficult by &s;teep Rocks, in the Mouth of the Harbour, that the Corporation had exhau&s;ted it&s;elf by endeavouring to cut through them; and being unable to proceed further in it; and at the &s;ame time, the Town-hou&s;e and School of the Town being run to Decay, and the Town it&s;elf de&s;titute of fre&s;h Water: To an&s;wer all the&s;e good Purpo&s;es, they procured an Act to pa&s;s, in the Year 1718. intituled, <HI>An Act for laying a Duty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Pennies</HI> Scots, <HI>or one</HI> 6<HI>th Part of a Penny, upon every Pint of Ale or Beer that &s;hall be &s;old within the Town of</HI> Dunbar; <HI>for improving and pre&s;erving the Harbour, and repairing the Town-hou&s;e, and building a School, and other publick Buildings there; and for &s;upplying the &s;aid Town with fre&s;h Water.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51">This Duty has been of very great Service to the Town, and has enabled them to make a great Pro|gre&s;s in the intended Improvements; but the prin|cipal Works, which were to dig up Part of a Rock at the Bottom of the Harbour, to carry out the great Pier to the Rock called <HI>The Beacon Rock,</HI> to cut the Slope of the I&s;land down to a Perpendicular, and to &s;upply the Town with fre&s;h Water, remaining un|done; and the Act expiring in the Year 1738. the &s;ame was continued for 25 Years longer, by an Act pa&s;&s;ed 10 <HI>Geo.</HI> II. which will, it is hoped, per|fect all that remains undone.</P>
<P>They had here a great Herring-fi&s;hery, which has decayed very much of late Years; and they cure Herrings here, as they do at <HI>Yarmouth</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> tho' I can't &s;ay they cure them &s;o well, nor are they &s;o fit for keeping and &s;ending on long Voyages. The Herrings them&s;elves may indeed make a little Differ|ence, being generally larger and fatter than tho&s;e of <HI>Yarmouth</HI>; which makes it more difficult to cure them, &s;o as to keep in a hot Climate, and on a long Voyage. Here was formerly a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, which was demoli&s;h'd by Act of Parliament during the Minority of King <HI>James</HI> VI.</P>
<P>Between the Town and the great Road &s;tands a little, but plea&s;ant and agreeable Seat of the Duke of <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> called <HI>Broxmouth,</HI> with a Park well planted in Vi&s;ta's and Walks; for the Gentlemen of <HI>Scotland</HI> are now &s;et upon planting Fore&s;t-trees, as well for Ornament as Profit. And here I would give an u&s;eful Hint to the Gentlemen who plant Trees in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Want of which, as I have ob&s;erved at &s;everal great Hou&s;es and Parks in that Country, is the Rea&s;on they do not thrive, as they might otherwi&s;e do: And this is, by &s;ecuring the young Trees by a triangular Frame &s;even or eight Feet high, which is made by &s;etting three large Stakes about them in an equilateral Triangle, and
<PB N="51" REF="52">
Tree and all, with Haybands, to defend the Bark, fa&s;ten'd together at the Top. Then, as the Tree &s;tands in the Centre of the Triangle, which way &s;oever the Wind blows, the Root is not &s;haken, or the Earth moved and loo&s;ened about it.</P>
<P>For want of this, the Tree being left without Support before it has taken Root, the Winds &s;hake it every way, and loo&s;en the Earth about it, &s;o that it gets no Time to &s;trike. This is the Rea&s;on why, in many of the Gentlemens Parks, I &s;aw the Trees &s;tunted and balked, though they had been planted many Years.</P>
<P>On the South-we&s;t Side of this Town, under the Mountains, near a Place called <HI>Dun-hill,</HI> is the Field where the Battle of <HI>Dunbar</HI> was fought between <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> and General <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, where the de&s;perate Few (for <HI>Crom|well</HI>'s Army was not above 8000 Men) defeated and totally overthrew the great Army of the other Side, killed 6000 of them, and took 10000 Pri&s;oners, to the Surprize of the World.</P>
<P>Here we turned out of the Way, to &s;ee the Mar|quis of <HI>Tweedale</HI>'s fine Park at <HI>Ye&s;ter,</HI> or <HI>Ze&s;ter</HI>; in the Centre of which &s;tands a very noble Hou&s;e, but in a too low Situation.</P>
<P>The old Earl of <HI>Tweedale,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. having &s;een the Plans of <HI>Greenwich</HI> and <HI>St. James</HI>'s Parks, was &s;o plea&s;ed with them, that, as &s;oon as he went down into <HI>Scotland,</HI> he laid out the Plan and De&s;ign of all tho&s;e noble Walks and Fore&s;ts of Trees, which he planted here. A Gentleman who&s;e Judgment I can depend upon, told me, that if ever tho&s;e Trees came to be worth but Six-pence apiece, they would be of more Value than the Fee Simple of the whole paternal E&s;tate of the Family. Nor is this unlikely, if it be true, that his Lord&s;hip, and his immediate Succe&s;&s;or, planted above 6000 Acres of Land with Fir-trees; and where-ever any
<PB N="52" REF="53">
of them failed, they were con&s;tantly renewed the next Year.</P>
<P>The Park it&s;elf is &s;aid to be eight Miles round, and exceeds, in many re&s;pects, the new Park at <HI>Rich|mond</HI> in <HI>Surrey:</HI> But the Plantation of Fir is not con|fined to this E&s;tate; for the Family has another Seat at <HI>Pinkey</HI> near <HI>Mu&s;&s;elburgh,</HI> where the &s;ame Lord planted al&s;o a great Number of Trees, as his Suc|ce&s;&s;ors have likewi&s;e done at another Seat, which they have in <HI>Fife,</HI> near <HI>Aberdour.</HI></P>
<P>As this Planting is a great Encouragement to the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> to improve their E&s;tates by the &s;ame Method, &s;o we find abundance of Gentlemen follow the Example; in&s;omuch that you hardly &s;ee a Hou&s;e of Note, e&s;pecially in the South Parts of this Country, but is adorned with Groves and Walks of Fir-trees about it; by which we may rea&s;onably ex|pect, that in a little time <HI>Scotland</HI> will have no need to &s;end to <HI>Norway</HI> for Timber and Deal, but will have &s;ufficient of her own, and, perhaps, be able to furni&s;h <HI>England</HI> too with con&s;iderable Quantities.</P>
<P>From this Town of <HI>Dunbar</HI> to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the Country may be reckoned as fruitful, plea&s;ant, and rich, as any in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or, indeed, as mo&s;t in <HI>England.</HI> The Sea is on the Right-hand at a moderate Di&s;tance, and the Hills on the Left, far|ther off, which are habitable, and feed large Flocks of Sheep, and have many open Roads leading over them from <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and other Parts, towards <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t material Thing this Country wants, is more inclo&s;ed Pa&s;tures, by which the Farmers would be enabled to keep a &s;ufficient Stock of Cattle well foddered in the Winter, and thereby not only be fur|ni&s;hed with Store of Butter, Chee&s;e, and Beef for the Market, but likewi&s;e by the Dung of the Bea&s;ts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nrich their Soil, according to the unan&s;werable
<PB N="53" REF="54">
Maxim in gra&s;ing, That Stock upon Land improves Land.</P>
<P>Two other Articles would increa&s;e and enrich them, which they &s;eldom or never practi&s;e:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Folding their Sheep within moveable Hurdles.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Fallowing their ploughed Land.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The fir&s;t would fatten the Ground, and the latter de&s;troy the Weeds; which would be of great Service to the Land at a Di&s;tance from the Sea, where they have not the Benefit of Sea-weed, which I have ju&s;t now mentioned.</P>
<P>But at pre&s;ent, for want of Inclo&s;ures, they have no Winter Provi&s;ion for black Cattle, and therefore the Farmers have no Dairies, no Butter or Chee&s;e, in any Quantity, and no Heaps of Dung in their Yards to return upon the Land for its Improvement. Thus a good Soil is impoveri&s;hed for want of Hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>From <HI>Dunbar</HI> we pa&s;s another River <HI>Tyne,</HI> which, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the two <HI>Tynes</HI> in <HI>Northumber|land,</HI> I &s;hall call <HI>Scots Tyne,</HI> tho' not &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed here. It ri&s;es in the Hills near <HI>Ye&s;ter,</HI> and watering part of the fine and plea&s;ant Vale I mentioned be|fore, runs by <HI>Haddingtoun,</HI> a Royal Burgh, and an old, half-ruined Town, with the Remains of an old Nunnery. It was formerly large, hand&s;ome, and well-built, and reckoned very &s;trong; for be&s;ides the Walls of Stone, which were in tho&s;e Times e&s;teemed very good, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fortified it with Lines and Ba&s;tions, four of which latter were very large, as may be &s;een by what remains of them to this Day. It had al&s;o a large Ditch, and was &s;o &s;trong, that the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> commanded by Sir <HI>George Wilford,</HI> de|fended it again&s;t a great Army of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> tho' his Gari&s;on were almo&s;t all &s;wept away by the Plague, till he was relieved from <HI>England,</HI> when he quitted it, after demoli&s;hing the Fortifications.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55">They have a good Stone-bridge here over the <HI>Tyne,</HI> tho' the River is but &s;mall. The Church was large, but has &s;uffered in the Ruin of the re&s;t, and but part of it is repaired, tho' big enough for the Num|ber of Inhabitants. There are in it &s;ome Monu|ments remaining of the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> and other <HI>Maitlands,</HI> ancient Lords of this Part of the Country; but as the Choir of the Church is open and defaced, they have &s;uffered with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In and about this Place I &s;aw &s;omething of a Ma|nufacture, and a Face of Indu&s;try, which was the fir&s;t I had hitherto &s;een the lea&s;t Appearance of in <HI>Scotland</HI>; particularly, here was a Woollen Manu|facture, erected by a Company or Corporation for making Broad-cloth, which they call <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth: And as they had <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Workmen, and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wool, they really made it very good; but I cannot &s;ay they could bring it &s;o cheap to the Market as they do in <HI>England.</HI> This was the Rea&s;on, that tho' before the late Union, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth being pro|hibited upon &s;evere Penalties, their own Cloth &s;up|plied them very well; yet, as &s;oon as the Union was made, by which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade was opened, the Clothiers from <HI>Worce&s;ter, Glouce&s;ter, Wilts, Somer|&s;et,</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> brought in their Goods, and under&s;elling the <HI>Scots,</HI> tho&s;e Manufacturies were not able to &s;tand it.

<P>In the Times of the late King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and his Brother King <HI>James</HI> VII. it was made a State-Pri&s;on, where the We&s;tern People, called in tho&s;e Days <HI>Cameronians,</HI> were confined, for being in Arms again&s;t the King. And after the Revolution a de&s;pe|rate Crew of People got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and having a large Boat, which they hoi&s;ted up upon the Rock, or let down at Plea&s;ure, committed &s;everal Piracies, took a great many Ve&s;&s;els, and held out the la&s;t of any Place in <HI>Great Britain</HI> for King <HI>James:</HI> But their Boat being at la&s;t either &s;eized or lo&s;t, and not being &s;ea&s;onably &s;upplied with Provi&s;ions from <HI>France,</HI> as they u&s;ed to be, they were obliged to &s;urrender.</P>
<P>The <HI>Solan</HI> Gee&s;e are the principal Inhabitants of this I&s;land, a Fowl rare as to its Kind; for they are not found any-where in <HI>Britain</HI> that I can learn, ex|cept here, in &s;ome of the le&s;&s;er I&s;lands in the <HI>Orcades,</HI> and in the I&s;land of <HI>Ailzye,</HI> in the Mouth of the <HI>Clyde.</HI> They come as certainly at their Sea&s;on, as the Swallows or Wood-cocks, with this Difference, (if what the People there tell us may be depended on) that they generally come exactly to the very &s;ame Day of the Month.</P>
<P>They feed mo&s;tly on Herrings, and therefore 'tis ob&s;erved, they come ju&s;t before or with them, and go away with them likewi&s;e, tho', 'tis evident, they do not follow them; for they go all away to the
<PB N="56" REF="57">
North, but whither, is not known. As they live on Fi&s;h, &s;o they eat like Fi&s;h, which, together with their being &s;o exceeding fat, makes them, in my Opinion, a very coar&s;e Di&s;h, rank, ill-reli&s;hed, and &s;oon gorges the Stomach. But here they are look'd upon as a Dainty.</P>
<P>It is a large Fowl, rather bigger than an ordinary Goo&s;e. 'Tis web-footed, but its Bill is pointed like a Crane or Heron, only much thicker, and not above five Inches long. When they are coming, they &s;end &s;ome before to fix their Man&s;ion, which, for that Rea&s;on, are called <HI>Scouts.</HI> The Inhabitants are careful not to di&s;turb them till they have built their Ne&s;ts, and then they are not to be frightened by any Noi&s;e what&s;oever. They lay but one Egg at a time, which they &s;o dextrou&s;ly fix by one End to a Point of the Rock in the middle of the Ne&s;t, that if it be pulled off, 'tis difficult to fix it &s;o any more. They hatch it, by holding it fa&s;t under one Foot, and &s;eldom leave it till it be hatched. The Fi&s;h caught by the old ones often &s;erve the Inhabitants for Food, and the Sticks they bring to make their Ne&s;ts &s;upply them with Fewel. They make great Profit both of the Fle&s;h and Feathers of their young ones, which are taken from their Ne&s;ts by one let down the Rock with a Rope. When young, they are of an a&s;h Colour; but when old, white.</P>
<P>At the Top of the Rock is a fre&s;h-water Spring, with a &s;mall Warren for Rabbets; but the Bottom of it is almo&s;t worn through by the Tide. It was for|merly the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;ometimes the Seat, of the antient Family of <HI>Lawder,</HI> who a long time refu&s;ed to &s;ell it, tho' often &s;olicited to it by &s;everal Kings. King <HI>James</HI> VI. told the then Laird, <HI>He would give him whatever he plea&s;ed to a&s;k for it</HI>; whereby that Gentleman had a fine Opportunity of making a good Bargain: But after he had told his Maje&s;ty, That he would &s;ell it upon the&s;e Terms, and the King de&s;iring
<PB N="57" REF="58">
to know what he would a&s;k, he an&s;wered, <HI>Your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t e'en re&s;ign it to me; for I'll have the ald Craig</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> Rock) <HI>back again.</HI> However, the Fa|mily, at la&s;t, coming to Decay, it was purcha&s;ed by King <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>From hence, keeping the Shore of the <HI>Forth,</HI> due We&s;t, we find a Range of large and populous Vil|lages all along the Coa&s;t, almo&s;t as far as <HI>Leith.</HI></P>
<P>All this Part of the Country is delightfully &s;pread with the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen; as the Duke of <HI>Roxburgh</HI>'s near <HI>Dunbar,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Had|dington</HI>'s at <HI>Tinningham,</HI> the Lord <HI>Beilhaven</HI>'s at <HI>Beilhaven,</HI> and that of the Family of <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> Earl of <HI>Stair,</HI> who have fine Seats at the Burgh of <HI>North Berwick,</HI> (where there is a &s;mall, but pretty good Market) <HI>Hales,</HI> and in the Neighbourhood of this Place.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e and E&s;tate of <HI>Dirleton,</HI> now in the Family of <HI>Ni&s;bet,</HI> is plea&s;antly &s;eated in this Part of the Country; as is <HI>Ormi&s;toun,</HI> a thriving little Town, belonging to the Family of <HI>Cockburn</HI>; round which they have a hand&s;ome E&s;tate, &s;o well planted and improved, that I don't remember to have ever &s;een a more beautiful Spot of Ground. They have al&s;o a pretty good Seat here; but when I &s;aw it, it was very much out of Repair.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here add, the antient and noble Hou&s;es of <HI>Seton</HI> and <HI>Winton,</HI> both Palaces (for &s;o they de&s;erve to be called) of the late Earl of <HI>Winton,</HI> who did &s;o many weak and ra&s;h Things in the Affair of the late Rebellion. They are now in a State of Ruin, as is the E&s;tate on which they &s;tand, which, for its Value, is as fine as any in <HI>Scotland,</HI> lying all conti|guous with it&s;elf, and valued at almo&s;t 5000<HI>l. Sterling per Annum</HI>; but all being under Forfeiture, it was &s;old to the <HI>York-Buildings</HI> Company. The fine Gates, and Stone Wall, were demoli&s;hed by the Govern|ment, after it had been made a Gari&s;on by the
<PB N="58" REF="59">
Highlanders, who from hence began their hare|brain'd March to <HI>England,</HI> which Expedition ended at <HI>Pre&s;ton.</HI> The Name <HI>Seton</HI> was given the Fa|mily from the Term <HI>Set-on,</HI> which one of the An|ce&s;tors of it u&s;ed to the Soldiers he commanded, when entering upon an Engagement. They were reckoned a very gallant, as well as loyal Family; and no true <HI>Scot&s;man</HI> can well omit telling the memorable Story, That in the Year 1332. when <HI>Edward</HI> II. came before <HI>Berwick,</HI> where Sir <HI>Alexander Seton</HI> was then Governor, he &s;ummoned him to &s;urrender, and threatened to hang his two Sons, whom he had among his Ho&s;tages, if he delayed. Accordingly a Gallows was erected near the Town Wall, and the young Men led forth. Tenderne&s;s for his Children began to move the Governor, when his Lady (of the Name of <HI>Cheyne</HI>) came and told him, <HI>He and &s;he were both young enough to have more Children; but if he &s;urren|dered, he could never recover his Honour.</HI> Upon this, he refu&s;ed, and the Tyrant cruelly murdered the young Gentlemen; but the Lady was rewarded with Two Sons afterwards.</P>
<P>The Towns upon this Coa&s;t, as I &s;aid, &s;tand very thick; and there are two or three Articles of Trade which render them more populous, and more con|&s;iderable, than they would otherwi&s;e be.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. There are great Quantities of white Fi&s;h taken and cured all along this Coa&s;t; and I ob&s;erved, that they were very well cured, merchantable, and fit for Exportation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. There is great Plenty of Coal in the Hills, &s;o near the Sea, that the Carriage is ea&s;y, a great deal of which is carried to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and other Towns thereabouts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They make very good Salt at almo&s;t all the Towns upon the Shore; as at <HI>Seton, Cockenny, Pre&s;tonpans,</HI> and &s;everal other Places. They have a
<PB N="59" REF="60">
very great Trade for this Salt to <HI>Norway, Ham|burgh, Bremen,</HI> the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and even <HI>Holland</HI>; and the Number of Ships loaded with it here yearly is very con&s;iderable.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They take great Quantities of Oy&s;ters here al&s;o, with which they not only &s;upply the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but carry abundance of them in large open Boats, called <HI>Cobles,</HI> as far as <HI>Newca&s;tle upon Tyne</HI>; from whence they generally bring back Gla&s;s Bottles.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>At &s;everal of the&s;e Villages are little Moles and Harbours, or Peers, built up at a con&s;iderable Ex|pence, for &s;ecuring the Ships that come to load Salt, and other Goods; as at <HI>North Berwick, Aberlady, Pre&s;ton, Pre&s;tonpans,</HI> which is al&s;o noted for good Malt Liquor, <HI>Cockenny, Port-&s;eton,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Country hereabouts is both plea&s;ant and po|pulous, and full of Gentlemens Hou&s;es; among which is <HI>Salton,</HI> belonging to Mr. <HI>Fletcher.</HI></P>
<P>We came next to <HI>Mu&s;&s;elburgh,</HI> an antient <HI>Burgh of Regality.</HI> In this Town are many Hands em|ployed in the Woollen Manufacture, e&s;pecially in coar&s;e Stuffs for the U&s;e of the Poor; and they have continued many Years &s;ucce&s;sfully this Branch of Trade without any Rival.</P>
<P>A little We&s;t from this lies <HI>Fi&s;her-raw,</HI> &s;o called from a very large Row of Hou&s;es mo&s;tly inhabited by Fi&s;hermen, who were formerly more numerous here than at pre&s;ent; for the Mu&s;cle Trade, which was of old reckoned very valuable, is now given over; and their chief Bu&s;ine&s;s, at pre&s;ent, con&s;i&s;ts in catching Cods, Haddocks, Whitings, and &s;ome few Shell-fi&s;h.</P>
<P>More to the South are two &s;mall Villages, called <HI>New-bigging</HI> and <HI>Good-&s;peed-all</HI>; but they are &s;o nearly joined to <HI>Mu&s;&s;elburgh</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;her-raw,</HI> that a
<PB N="60" REF="61">
Stranger would take them to be all one continued Town. Neverthele&s;s, they have not had a Church &s;ince the Reformation, but are only a Part of the Pari&s;h of <HI>Invere&s;k,</HI> an adjoining Village, &s;o called, becau&s;e it &s;tands on the River <HI>E&s;k,</HI> which, tho' it be &s;ometimes &s;o full of Water as to overflow its Banks, yet, being rapid, it is not made navigable.</P>
<P>This Village enjoys &s;o good an Air, that the emi|nent Dr. <HI>Pitcairn</HI> called it the <HI>Montpelier</HI> of <HI>Scot|land.</HI> It is very full of People, and there are &s;everal very hand&s;ome Hou&s;es and Gardens in it, which invite the Citizens of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to take Lodgings here in the Summer, as the <HI>Londoners</HI> do at <HI>Ken|&s;ington-gravel-pits, Hamp&s;tead, Hackney,</HI> and <HI>High-gate.</HI></P>
<P>But the Glory and Beauty of this Pari&s;h is <HI>Pinkey,</HI> which formerly belonged to <HI>Seton,</HI> Earl of <HI>Dumferm|line,</HI> but now to the Marquis of <HI>Tweedale,</HI> who u&s;ually re&s;ided here before his Hou&s;e at <HI>Ye&s;ter</HI> was fini&s;hed; which, tho' it be the mo&s;t magnificent Building, yet is not &s;o agreeably &s;ituated as <HI>Pinkey,</HI> which &s;tands near the Sea, ju&s;t as we enter into <HI>Mu&s;&s;elburgh.</HI></P>
<P>In the Court before the Hou&s;e is a large Stone Well, covered with an Imperial Crown of Stone, &s;upported by Pillars of the <HI>Ionick Order.</HI> The great Hall on the Right, as you enter, is adorned with Views of the great Cities of <HI>Italy</HI>; and in a Drawing-room adjoining to it, is a Billiard-table. The great Stair-ca&s;e on the Left is balu&s;traded with Iron, and crowded with Pictures.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Apartment con&s;i&s;ts of a Dining-room, Drawing-room, and Bed-chamber, all very &s;paci|ous, curiou&s;ly wain&s;cotted with Oak, and hung with the Sea&s;ons in Tape&s;try, of the &s;mall Figures, and be&s;t Sort. The Bed is of crim&s;on Velvet in an Alcove, neatly &s;upported with Pillars. The Chim|neys are of Marble, and above that of the Dining-room
<PB N="61" REF="62">
is painted the fine&s;t In&s;ide of a Church that is any-where to be &s;een.</P>
<P>The great Gallery is very long and &s;pacious, the Ceiling whereof is full of <HI>Latin</HI> In&s;criptions &s;uitable to the &s;everal Paintings. Here is a Family Picture of the Lord <HI>Seton,</HI> with his Four Sons and Daughters, by <HI>Hans Holbein</HI>; Mr. <HI>Hender&s;on,</HI> the Covenanter, by <HI>Vandyke</HI>; the whole Length of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and his Chancellor, the Earl of <HI>Dumfermline,</HI> in his Robes, by the &s;ame Hand. The fir&s;t Earl of <HI>Twee|dale,</HI> with his Eight Sons and Seven Daughters, all in one Picture, as big as the Life, takes up almo&s;t one End of the Room. There are fine Altar-pieces, Pa&s;&s;ion-pieces, and others of that Kind, that were &s;aved from Plunder out of Mona&s;teries at the Refor|mation. Here is likewi&s;e a good Picture of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and another of the Duke of <HI>Lau|derdale,</HI> (who married his only Child to the Heir of this Family) with great Numbers of Family Pictures of the <HI>Hays</HI> and <HI>Setons.</HI> There is al&s;o well pre&s;erved the genealogical Tree of the Family, from the Year 970. to this Time; <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Hays, Giffards,</HI> and <HI>Frazers.</HI> But many of the Pictures have been of late carried to <HI>Ye&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The Parterre behind the Hou&s;e is very large, and nobly adorned with Ever-greens, and on each Side of it &s;pacious Gardens. The Whole &s;tands in a Park above three Miles in Circumference, well planted with an incredible Number of Fir-trees, and walled round with Stone. I confe&s;s, if I had been Owner of <HI>Pinkey,</HI> I &s;hould hardly have built <HI>Ye&s;ter</HI>; for <HI>Pin|key</HI> &s;tands nobly, and has a commanding Pro&s;pect, not only over the adjacent Country, but al&s;o of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Fife,</HI> over the Sea, at nine Miles Di&s;tance: Whereas <HI>Ye&s;ter,</HI> as I have &s;aid, lies in a Bottom, and all its Views bounded within it&s;elf. <HI>Ye&s;ter,</HI> 'tis true, is the antient Seat of the Family, who&s;e Title to <HI>Pinkey</HI> is but late, and (&s;ome &s;ay) was precarious.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63">Near this Place was fought a Battle by <HI>Edward Seymour,</HI> Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> when he came to force the <HI>Scots</HI> into the Marriage of their young Queen <HI>Mary</HI> with his Nephew King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. which was, by-the-by, a very coar&s;e way of Wooing. Here was a great Slaughter of the <HI>Scots:</HI> But tho' the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> won the Battle, yet they lo&s;t their Prize; for the young Queen was privately embarked, carried to <HI>France,</HI> and afterwards married to the Dauphin, who became King <HI>Francis</HI> II.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> call this the Battle of <HI>Mu&s;&s;elburgh</HI>; but &s;ome <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen, riding out with us, to &s;hew us the Place where the Action was begun and ended, we all agreed, that the <HI>Scots</HI> are in the right, who call it the Battle of <HI>Pinkey.</HI></P>
<P>I now approached the capital City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; but mu&s;t &s;ay a Word or two of its Situation, before I enter it. Standing then at a &s;mall Di&s;tance, and taking a View of it from the Ea&s;t, you have really but a very confu&s;ed Idea of the City, becau&s;e the Situation being in Length from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, and the Breadth ill-proportioned to it, you view it under the greate&s;t Di&s;advantage po&s;&s;ible; whereas, if you turn a little to the Right-hand towards <HI>Leith,</HI> you have a very hand&s;ome Pro&s;pect of it; and from the South you &s;ee it to yet more Advantage, becau&s;e it is increa&s;ed on that Side with new Streets.</P>
<P>At the Extremity of the Ea&s;t-end of the City &s;tands the Palace of <HI>Holy-rood-hou&s;e</HI>; leaving which, a little to the Left, you come thro' a populous Sub|urb to the Entrance, called the <HI>Water-port.</HI> From hence, turning We&s;t, the Street goes on in a &s;trait Line, thro' the whole City to the Ca&s;tle. It is above a Mile in Length, and is, perhaps, the large&s;t, longe&s;t, and fine&s;t Street, for Buildings, and Number of Inhabitants, in the World.</P>
<P>From the Palace Door, which &s;tands on a Level with the lowe&s;t of the plain Country, the Street
<PB N="63" REF="64">
begins to a&s;cend very gradually, being no-where &s;teep; but this A&s;cent being continued for &s;o long a Way, it is ea&s;y to under&s;tand, that the further Part mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be very high; for the Ca&s;tle, which &s;tands, as it were, at the Extremity We&s;t, as the Palace does Ea&s;t, makes, on all the three Sides, (that only excepted, which joins it to the City) a frightful and impa&s;&s;able Precipice.</P>
<P>Together with this continued A&s;cent, you are to &s;uppo&s;e the Edge or Top of the A&s;cent &s;o narrow, that the Street, and the Row of Hou&s;es on each Side, take up the whole Breadth; &s;o that which way &s;oever you turn, you go down Hill imme|diately; which is &s;o &s;teep, that it is very trouble&s;ome to tho&s;e who have not very good Lungs, to walk in tho&s;e Side-lanes, which they call <HI>Wynds.</HI> By this De&s;cription you will perceive, that the City &s;tands upon the narrow Ridge of a long a&s;cending Mountain.</P>
<P>On the North-&s;ide of the City, towards the We&s;t-end of it, where the Ca&s;tle &s;tands, is a Lough, or Lake of Water; which has a &s;mall Brook that runs thro' it, &s;o that it cannot be &s;aid to be quite &s;tand|ing. There was formerly another Lake on the South-&s;ide of it, which, being now filled up, is built into a Street, tho' &s;o much lower than the high Street, that, as I &s;aid before, the Lanes between them are very &s;teep.</P>
<P>The Town is &s;o antient, that no Hi&s;tory has recorded when, by whom, or on what Occa&s;ion, it was built; yet, it &s;eems mo&s;t natural to conclude, that &s;uch a Situation could not be cho&s;en, but for a Retreat from the Outrages and Attempts of the <HI>Britons, Saxons, Danes,</HI> or other Enemies; for having an impregnable Ca&s;tle at the We&s;t-end, and a Lake on either Side, the Inhabitants had nothing to defend but the Entrance at the Ea&s;t-end, which it was ea&s;y to fortify.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65">If this was not the Rea&s;on for chu&s;ing the Situa|tion, what &s;hould have hindered them from building the City in a plea&s;ant, delightful Valley, with the Sea flowing up to one Side, and a River running thro' the Middle of it? &s;uch as that Space of Ground between it and the Sea, where the Town of <HI>Leith</HI> &s;tands. There they would have had a noble, plea|&s;ant, and mo&s;t u&s;eful Situation, a very fine Harbour for their Trade, a good Road in the <HI>Firth</HI> for their Ships of Burden; a plea&s;ant River, which, with &s;mall Art and Charge, might have been &s;o drawn round the City as to have filled its Ditches, and made its Fortifications almo&s;t impregnable, as the <HI>French</HI> did, when they fortified <HI>Leith.</HI> Or had they gone to the South-&s;ide of the City, and extended it to|wards <HI>Libertoun</HI> and <HI>Goodtrees,</HI> they had found a Plain large enough to have contained another <HI>London,</HI> watered on the South-part with a plea&s;ant Brook, capable, by the Help of Pipes, to have conveyed Water into every Street and Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things they did not fore&s;ee, or not under|&s;tand in tho&s;e Days; but, regarding immediate Safety, fixed on the Hill, as a &s;ure Strength, formed by Nature, ready at their Hand. By this means, the City lies under &s;uch Inconveniencies as are made a Subject of Scorn and Reproach by &s;ome, as if the People delighted in Stench and Na&s;tine&s;s; whereas, were any other People to live under the &s;ame Unhap|pine&s;s of a rocky and mountainous Situation, a Throng of Buildings from &s;ix to ten Stories high, a Difficulty of obtaining Water, (that little they have being to be carried up to the uppermo&s;t Apartments) we &s;hould find a <HI>London</HI> or a <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> as dirty as <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> and, perhaps, le&s;s able to make their Dwel|ling tolerable, at lea&s;t in &s;o narrow a Compa&s;s; for tho' many Cities have more People in them, yet, I believe, there is none in the World, where &s;o many People live in &s;o little Room.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="66">On the North-&s;ide of the City, as I have &s;aid, is a &s;pacious, rich, and plea&s;ant Plain, extending from the Lake, which joins it, to the River of <HI>Leith,</HI> at the Mouth of which is the Town of <HI>Leith,</HI> at the Di&s;tance of a long <HI>Scots</HI> Mile. Here, were not the North-&s;ide of the Hill which the City &s;tands on, &s;o exceeding &s;teep, that it is not only impa&s;&s;able for Carriages, but can hardly be clambered up on Foot, and were the Lake filled up, as that on the other Side is, the City might have been extended upon the Plain below, and fine Streets would, no doubt, have been built: Nay, I que&s;tion much, whether, in time, the high Streets would not have been for|&s;aken, and the City, as I may &s;ay, run all out of its Gates to the North.</P>
<P>This might have been the Con&s;equence, if the City had been in a State of Increa&s;e; for had their Trade flouri&s;hed, as was rea&s;onably expected, if the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Darien</HI> had &s;ucceeded, or upon the Union, the Inhabitants would have likewi&s;e increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered the City in its outward Appearance, and in its Situation, I mu&s;t look next into its In&s;ide, where we &s;hall find it (notwith&s;tand|ing all its Di&s;couragements and Di&s;advantages) a large, populous, noble, rich, and even Royal City. The main Street, as above, is the mo&s;t &s;pacious and be&s;t inhabited in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Buildings are &s;urpri&s;ing for their Strength, their Beauty, and their Height, and are mo&s;tly of Free-&s;tone; yet &s;o firm, that tho' they &s;tand &s;o high, and in a Country where Storms and violent Winds are &s;o frequent, 'tis very rare, and only on &s;uch Occa&s;ions as I &s;hall mention by-and-by, that any Damage is done here.</P>
<P>From the Palace-gate We&s;tward, this Street is called the <HI>Canongate,</HI> as belonging to the Canons of the Abbey, which is a kind of Suburb by it&s;elf, as <HI>Southwark</HI> is to <HI>London.</HI> In this Part of the Street, tho' otherwi&s;e not &s;o well inhabited as the City it&s;elf,
<PB N="66" REF="67">
are &s;everal very magnificent Hou&s;es of the Nobility, built for their Re&s;idence when the Court was here. Of the&s;e the Duke of <HI>Queen&s;bury</HI>'s, the Earl of <HI>Winton</HI>'s, the Duke of <HI>Roxburgh</HI>'s, the Earl of <HI>Panmure</HI>'s, and the Earl of <HI>Murray</HI>'s, are the chief: The fir&s;t and la&s;t are very large and princely Build|ings, all of Free-&s;tone, large in Front, and have good Gardens behind them.</P>
<P>At the Upper or We&s;t-end of this Street, where it joins to the City, is a Gate, which, like <HI>Ludgate,</HI> parts the City from the Suburb, but does not di&s;|continue the Street, which rather widens, and is more &s;pacious, when you are thro' the Gate, than before. This is the famous <HI>Nether-bow Port,</HI> who&s;e Doors were like to have been taken away by the Par|liament, when the Affair of Captain <HI>Porteous</HI> was under their Con&s;ideration, as I &s;hall mention more particularly by-and-by.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this Gate, on the Out&s;ide, are two Streets, one of which is called <HI>St. Mary Wynd,</HI> and the other <HI>Leith Wynd</HI>; the fir&s;t leads out of the City, South, into the great Road for <HI>England,</HI> by the Way of <HI>Kel&s;o</HI>; and at the Foot of it is a Gate turning We&s;t|ward into the low Street, called the <HI>Cowgate,</HI> be|cau&s;e the Cattle are driven thro' it to and from the great Market-place: The other leads North into a Suburb, called the <HI>Calton,</HI> from whence there is a very hand&s;ome Gravel-walk, 20 Feet broad, con|tinued to the Town of <HI>Leith,</HI> which is kept in Re|pair at the publick Charge, and no Hor&s;es &s;uffered to come upon it.</P>
<P>We now enter the City at the <HI>Nether-bow Port,</HI> and have an open View up the high Street. It mu&s;t not be expected I &s;hould de&s;cribe all the Buildings of the City; I &s;hall therefore touch upon &s;ome few, and go on. The fir&s;t of any Note is a fine Hou&s;e on the South-&s;ide of the Street, a little within the Gate, belonging to the Marquis of <HI>Tweedale,</HI> with a
<PB N="67" REF="68">
Plantation of Lime-trees behind it, the Place not allowing Room for a large Garden: Adjoining to this are very good Buildings, which, if &s;et out in hand&s;ome Streets, would adorn a very noble City; but being crouded together in narrow Wynds and Alleys, de&s;erve no Notice.</P>
<P>A little further, on the &s;ame Side, is the <HI>Trone</HI> Kirk; and near it, in the Middle of the Street, &s;tands the Guard-hou&s;e, where two Companies of di&s;ci|plined Men, cloathed and armed like Grenadiers at the Charge of the Town, do Duty every Night, and keep the publick Peace of the City.</P>
<P>About Mid-way between the <HI>Nether-bow</HI> and the Ca&s;tle, is the great Church, which, before the Re|formation, was Collegiate, and dedicated to <HI>St. Gyles</HI>; but it was afterwards divided into &s;everal Preaching-places, and Di&s;tricts of the City were allotted to them, &s;o as to be parochial. When King <HI>Charles</HI> I. erected a new Bi&s;hoprick at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> which be|fore that time was in the Dioce&s;e of <HI>St. Andrews,</HI> it was made a Cathedral, and the Dean was Forenoon Mini&s;ter of that Part of it, called the <HI>New Kirk,</HI> which is the Choir, Chancel, or Ea&s;tern Part. In it is a noble Gallery for the King, or his Commi&s;|&s;ioner. Here al&s;o the Magi&s;trates a&s;&s;emble, and the Judges in their Habits, in time of Se&s;&s;ion. In a large Chapel, on the South-we&s;t Part of this Church, the General A&s;&s;embly hold their Se&s;&s;ions, as does al&s;o the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly, in the Interval be|tween the General Meetings.</P>
<P>The great Cro&s;s under the Tower is called the <HI>Old Kirk</HI>; and the Front or We&s;t-part of the great Church is divided into two Parts: That on the South is called the <HI>Tolbooth Kirk,</HI> and that on the North <HI>Haddo's Hole,</HI> from the Laird of <HI>Haddo,</HI> (Grandfather to the pre&s;ent Earl of <HI>Aberdeen</HI>) who being a great Royali&s;t and Anti-covenanter, was kept Pri&s;oner in a Vault there, till he was beheaded.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69">The Steeple in the Middle is very high, and of good Architecture; the Summit of it re&s;embles an Impe|rial Crown. Here they have a Set of Bells, which are not rung out as in <HI>England,</HI> (for that way of Ringing is not known in this Country) but are played upon by the Hand with Keys, like a Harp&s;ichord, the Per&s;on playing having great Leather Covers to his Fi&s;ts, by which he is able to &s;trike with the more Force. They play all manner of Tunes very mu&s;i|cally, and the Town gives a Man a yearly Salary for playing upon them from half an Hour after Eleven, till half an Hour after Twelve, every Day, <HI>Sundays</HI> and <HI>Holidays</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>On the South-&s;ide of this Church (formerly the Church-yard) is a Square of very fine Buildings, called the <HI>Parliament Clo&s;e,</HI> the We&s;t and South-&s;ides of which are mo&s;tly taken up with the Parliament-hou&s;e, the &s;everal Courts of Ju&s;tice, the Council-chamber, the Exchequer, the publick Regi&s;ters, the Court for the Royal Boroughs to a&s;&s;emble in, the Lawyers Library, the Po&s;t Office, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The great Church makes up the North-&s;ide of the Square, and the Ea&s;t and Part of the South-&s;ide is built into pri|vate Dwellings very &s;tately, lofty, and &s;trong, being &s;even Stories high to the Front of the Square, and the Hill they &s;tand on having a very &s;teep De&s;cent, &s;ome of them are no le&s;s than fourteen Stories high backwards. In the middle of this Square is an Eque|&s;trian Statue of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. which is reckoned the fine&s;t of its kind in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament-hou&s;e is a &s;tately, convenient, and large Structure. Over its Entrance are the Arms of <HI>Scotland</HI> well cut, with <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> on each Side, for Supporters; and this In&s;cription, <HI>Stant his felicia regna</HI>; importing, that the&s;e Virtues make Kingdoms happy. And under the Arms was this Motto, <HI>Unio Unionum</HI>; relating not only to the Union of the two Crowns, but &s;ignifying, that
<PB N="69" REF="70">
their Advice was nece&s;&s;ary for the Maintenance of it. The Room for meeting of the Parliament had, on that Occa&s;ion, a high Throne for the Sovereign, or the Commi&s;&s;ioner, with Benches on each Side for the Nobility and Bi&s;hops, and Forms conve|niently placed in the Middle, for the Commoners. Without the Area was a Pulpit for Sermons to the Parliament, on particular Occa&s;ions; and be|hind the Pulpit a large Partition for others, be|&s;ides Members, to hear the Sermons, and Debates of the Hou&s;e, when they thought fit to allow it. This Building, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re&s;embles <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall,</HI> and tho' not quite &s;o large, has a much more curious Roof. In the South or Upper-end, one of the ordinary Judges &s;its every Week in Se&s;&s;ion-time, to hear Cau&s;es in the fir&s;t In&s;tance: But when the Parliament &s;at, that Court was removed to another Part of the Hall. At the We&s;t-end of it are kept the Sheriff and Commi&s;&s;ary Courts. Near the North-end is the Town Council-hou&s;e or <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> and over it is the Ju&s;tciary or Criminal Court. At the South-ea&s;t Part of the Parliament-hou&s;e, is a Door from what they call the <HI>Outer-hou&s;e</HI> (where the Lord Ordinary &s;its) into the <HI>Inner,</HI> where &s;it the other Fourteen Judges, or Lords of Se&s;&s;ion; which is the &s;upreme Civil Judicature of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Over which are Apartments for the Lords of Exchequer, and for the Privy-council when in Being.</P>
<P>In the Lower-part under the Parliament-hou&s;e, is a noble Library of Books and MSS. belonging to the College of Ju&s;tice, or Gentlemen of the Law.</P>
<P>Near the Council-chamber &s;tands the Royal Ex|change, made up of a double Row of Shops, and another Exchange inferior to this.</P>
<P>The great Opening into the high Street, being the only Pa&s;&s;age into it for Coaches, is at the North-ea&s;t Corner, a little from which is the Market-cro&s;s, where all their Proclamations and publick Acts are
<PB N="70" REF="71">
read and publi&s;hed by Heralds and Sound of Trum|pet. Here is the great Parade, where Gentlemen meet for Bu&s;ine&s;s or News, as at the Exchange, every Day from Eleven to One.</P>
<P>Near the We&s;t-end of the great Church &s;tands the <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> or common Pri&s;on, as well for Criminals as for Debtors. It was formerly the Place of Re&s;i|dence for the Provo&s;t of <HI>St. Gyles's,</HI> as mo&s;t of the adjacent Hou&s;es were for the Canons and Choiri&s;ters of that Church.</P>
<P>The great Church and this Pri&s;on both &s;tanding in the middle of the Street, the Breadth and Beauty of it is for &s;ome Space interrupted; but tho&s;e Build|ings pa&s;t, the Street opens again to its former Breadth, and is now called the <HI>Lawn-market,</HI> from the <HI>Linen-market</HI> being kept here. This Part of the Street extends We&s;t to a narrower one, which leads to the <HI>Ca&s;tle-hill.</HI> At the Upper-end of it is a Stone Build|ing appropriated to &s;everal publick Offices of le&s;&s;er Value, called the <HI>Weigh-hou&s;e</HI>; for below Stairs are Ware-hou&s;es, with publick Weights and Scales for weighing heavy Goods.</P>
<P>Here the high Street parts into two, one of which leads to the Ca&s;tle Hill, as already noticed, and the other turns South-we&s;t, and de&s;cending gradually, leads to the <HI>Gra&s;s-market,</HI> a Place very like <HI>Smith|field</HI> in every re&s;pect, where is kept a weekly Mar|ket for Black Cattle, Sheep, Hor&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Street, which is called the <HI>We&s;t-bow,</HI> is inhabited mo&s;tly by whole&s;ale Dealers in Iron, Pitch, Tar, Oil, Hemp, Flax, Lin&s;eed, Drugs, Woads, and &s;uch-like heavy Goods.</P>
<P>This City hath &s;even Gates, or Ports, as they are here called, <HI>viz.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Nether-bow Port:</HI> This is the chief Gate; it was magnificently built in 1606. and adorn'd with Towers on both Sides. This is the Entrance from the
<PB N="71" REF="72">
Palace, and the principal Suburb called the <HI>Canon-gate.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>Cow-gate Port,</HI> at the Ea&s;t-end, likewi&s;e gives Entrance to the Street of that Name, leading to the Abbey by a Backway.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The <HI>Potter-row Port,</HI> gives Entrance to the Suburb &s;o called, and leads to <HI>Dalkeith, Kel&s;o,</HI> &amp;c. Southward.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The <HI>Society Port,</HI> called &s;o from the Society of Brewers, who have a great &s;quare Court near it, with &s;tately Hou&s;es and Buildings round it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The <HI>We&s;t Port,</HI> the only Gate at the We&s;t-end of the City, which leads thro' a large Suburb to <HI>Gla&s;gow, Sterling, Queens-ferry,</HI> and from thence to the We&s;t and North Highlands.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The <HI>New Port,</HI> at the Ea&s;t-end of the Lake, leading Northward towards a Village called <HI>Mouter's Hill</HI> and <HI>Leith.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The <HI>College-Kirk Port,</HI> leading al&s;o to <HI>Leith.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Markets here are very well &s;upplied with all the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, and are mo&s;tly kept in di&s;tinct Market-places walled in, and re&s;erved for the parti|cular Things they are appointed for; &s;uch as

<ITEM>6. The Leather Market.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a Weekly Market for all Sorts of Woollen Manufactures, and Linen Cloth, kept in that Part of the high Street called the <HI>Lawn Market,</HI> ju&s;t now mentioned. There is al&s;o in the &s;ame Street, below the Cro&s;s, an Herb and Fruit Market kept every Morning, but abates before Noon, &s;o that it is no Incumbrance. The Market for Black Cattle, Sheep, Hor&s;es, and Gra&s;s, is kept in that
<PB N="72" REF="73">
large Space of Ground within the <HI>We&s;t Port,</HI> called the <HI>Gra&s;s Market,</HI> as I have already mentioned.</P>
<P>On the South-&s;ide of the City, towards the Ea&s;t-end, &s;tands a large Building, erected at the Charge of the Surgeons and Apothecaries of this City, in which is their great Hall, hung round with the Pi|ctures of all the Surgeons of this Place that have been &s;ince this Building was founded. Here they have al&s;o a Theatre for Di&s;&s;ections, and a Chamber of Rarities, in which there are &s;everal Skeletons of uncommon Creatures, a Mummy, and other Cu|rio&s;ities.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Potter-row Port</HI> &s;tands the College, or Univer&s;ity. It con&s;i&s;ts of three Courts, two lower, and one higher, equal to the other two. The&s;e Courts are encompa&s;&s;ed with neat Buildings for the U&s;e of &s;uch Students as plea&s;e to lodge in them; for they don't live in common, nor are they obliged to re&s;ide, but only to attend their Cla&s;&s;es at certain Hours. There is a high Tower over the great Gate, looking to the City.</P>
<P>The <HI>Publick Schools</HI> are large and commodious; there are Accommodations for Students, hand&s;ome Dwellings for the Profe&s;&s;ors, and fine Gardens for their Recreation. It was founded in 1580. by King <HI>James</HI> VI. upon a Petition from the City, to grant them a Charter with the Privilege of an Univer&s;ity; but the Foundation was not perfected till 1582. The Per&s;ons e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Foundation were, a Principal or Primate, a Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity, four Regents or Ma&s;ters of Philo&s;ophy, and a Profe&s;&s;or of Philology called <HI>Prof. Humaniorum Literarum,</HI> or Regent of Humanity. In 1640. the Town added a Profe&s;&s;or of Mathematicks. To which have been lately added Profe&s;&s;ors of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, Civil Law, Theoretical and Practical Me|dicine, Chymi&s;try, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Dignity of Chancellor
<PB N="73" REF="74">
and Vice-chancellor of the Univer&s;ity is in the Lord-Provo&s;t and Town Council.</P>
<P>They have a very good Library, which was founded by <HI>Clement Little,</HI> one of the Commi&s;&s;aries of <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; &s;ince which it is much increa&s;ed by Donations from the Citizens, Per&s;ons of Quality, and others, who had their Education there. The Library is neatly kept, well furni&s;hed with Books, put in very good Order, cloi&s;ter'd with Wire Doors, which none but the Keeper can open, which is more commodious, and le&s;s encumbering, than Multitudes of Chains, commonly u&s;ed in other Libraries. The Books given by the grand Benefactors, are kept in di&s;tinct Apartments, and the Donor's Name over them in Letters of Gold.</P>
<P>Over the Books hang the Pictures of &s;everal Princes, and of the mo&s;t eminent Reformers at Home and Abroad; and near them is kept the Skull of the fa|mous <HI>Buchanan,</HI> very intire, and &s;o thin, that the Light may be &s;een thro' it. It was depo&s;ited there by Mr. <HI>Adam&s;on,</HI> formerly Principal of the Univer&s;ity, who procured it to be taken out of his Grave, and fa&s;tened &s;ome <HI>Latin</HI> Ver&s;es to it in Commendation of that celebrated Hi&s;torian. There is al&s;o the Ori|ginal of the <HI>Bohemian</HI> Prote&s;t again&s;t the Council of <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> for burning <HI>John Hus</HI> and <HI>Jerom</HI> of <HI>Prague, Anno</HI> 1417. with 105 Seals of <HI>Bohemian</HI> and <HI>Moravian</HI> Grandees annexed to it. It was pro|cured by a <HI>Scots</HI> Gentleman in his Travels, and given to the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>Under the Library was the King's Printing-hou&s;e, for Bibles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> At the farther End of the Library is a Stair-ca&s;e, which leads to the higher and lower Common Halls, where they hold their Commence|ments and College Entertainmenrs. In this Place are &s;everal Maps, Globes, Books, and Rarities; and among others a crooked Horn, cut out of a Woman's Head when fifty Years old, and who lived twelve
<PB N="74" REF="75">
Years after it. It is &s;everal Inches long, and was taken out of her Head by a Surgeon, <HI>Anno</HI> 1671. Here al&s;o are Lectures read, Exerci&s;es performed, and Apartments for the Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity to teach his Pupils in, and for a &s;elect Library proper for Divines.</P>
<P>In this higher Common Hall, which is a very &s;pa|cious Room, are placed &s;uch Books as have been bought by, or given to the College, &s;ince the Li|brary below was full; and in the South-end of it is a curious and noble Mu&s;eum, collected by the very eminent Sir <HI>Andrew Balfour,</HI> who was once Tutor to the famous Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI> It contains a va&s;t Trea&s;ure of Curio&s;ities of Art and Nature, dome&s;tick and foreign, from almo&s;t all Parts of the World, and is greatly valued by the Virtuo&s;o's, containing &s;ome Rarities that are not to be found, either in tho&s;e of the <HI>Royal Society</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> or the <HI>A&s;hmolean</HI> at <HI>Oxford.</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Sibbald,</HI> having a mind to engraft his Name and Merit, on that of the celebrated <HI>Balfour,</HI> made a Pre&s;ent of a great Number of Shells, and other Curio&s;ities, to the College, on Condition the Magi&s;trates would print the Account of it, called, <HI>Auctarium Mu&s;ei Balfouriani e Mu&s;eo Sib|baldiano</HI>; to which I refer the Reader.</P>
<P>Ea&s;tward from the College is the High-School, well endow'd, and with proper Apartments for one Ma&s;ter and four U&s;hers, who teach Youth Grammar and Rhetorick.</P>
<P>In <HI>Gray's-clo&s;e,</HI> near the <HI>Cowgate Port,</HI> is the Mint-hou&s;e, in a large Court, with neat and con|venient Buildings, and other Accommodations for the Ma&s;ter, Officers, and Workmen. It is now di&s;u&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e; and is a Sanctuary, or Place of Privilege.</P>
<P>At a &s;mall Di&s;tance from the College are two neat Ho&s;pitals, with pretty Gardens to each of them; and a little further is the Church-yard of the <HI>Franci&s;cans,</HI> or <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y-friars,</HI> the common Burial-place for the
<PB N="75" REF="76">
whole City within the Walls, where are a great many fine and curious Monuments. It contains about two Acres of Ground.</P>
<P>Adjoining to it is <HI>Heriot's Ho&s;pital,</HI> a large and &s;tately Building, the mo&s;t magnificent of its Kind in the World, adorned with a con&s;ecrated Chapel, large Walks, delightful Greens, and plea&s;ant Gardens. It was built by the Rev. Dr. <HI>Balcanqual,</HI> to whom <HI>George Heriot,</HI> Jeweller to King <HI>James</HI> VI. left near 17000 Pounds, to be di&s;po&s;ed of in pious U&s;es, which that worthy Dean did by building and endowing this Hou&s;e, and giving Statutes to it, which he ordered &s;hould be <HI>unalterable.</HI> 'Tis a Nur&s;ery for an inde|finite Number of the Sons of Freemen, who are maintained, cloathed, and educated in u&s;eful Learning, till they are fit for Apprentice&s;hips, or to go to the Univer&s;ity, where they are allowed hand&s;ome Salaries and Exhibitions.</P>
<P>On the South-&s;ide of the City, in the way to <HI>Leith,</HI> is a beautiful Collegiate Church, built by Queen <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Guelders,</HI> Queen to King <HI>James</HI> II. and dedicated to the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> but now Parochial, tho' nothing but the Church Part was ever fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Near it is <HI>St. Thomas's Ho&s;pital</HI>; wherein old decayed Citizens, and their Widows, are very de|cently provided for, and allowed a Chaplain.</P>
<P>Over-again&s;t it is <HI>Bridewell,</HI> or the Hou&s;e of Cor|rection, in which di&s;&s;olute People undergo Di&s;cipline, and are kept to hard Labour. There is an Apart|ment in it for lunatick and di&s;tracted Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Of late Years, Mrs. <HI>Hare</HI> left a noble Benefaction for a new Ho&s;pital for Female Orphans of decay'd Freemen; which created a laudable Emulation in many others, who&s;e united Contributions have rai&s;ed another, for the &s;ame good Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>An Infirmary, called the <HI>Royal Infirmary,</HI> after the Example of tho&s;e at <HI>London, Winche&s;ter,</HI> &amp;c. has been lately erected at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> by the liberal
<PB N="76" REF="77">
Contribution of many well-di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons; and there was &s;o general a Good-will to the Work, that the like Spirit has hardly ever been known any-where. The Proprietors of &s;everal Stone-Quarries made Pre|&s;ents of Stone to it, others of Lime. Merchants contributed Timber. The Wrights and Ma&s;ons were not wanting in their Contributions: The neighbour|ing Farmers agreed to carry Materials <HI>gratis:</HI> The Journeymen Ma&s;ons contributed their Labour for a certain Quantity of hewn Stones; and as this Under|taking is for the Relief of the di&s;ea&s;ed, lame, and maimed Poor, even the Day-labourers would not be exempted, but conditioned to work a Day in a Month <HI>gratis</HI> to the Erection. The Ladies too con|tributed in their own way to it; for they appointed an A&s;&s;embly for the Benefit of the Work; and it be|ing well-attended, every one contributed bountifully to it. It has met with no &s;mall Encouragement from the Nobility and Gentry; and his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to give 100<HI>l.</HI> towards it: So that it is really a noble Work, and is now in a flouri&s;hing Condition. The following is the In&s;cription on the fir&s;t Stone:

The late learned and in|du&s;trious Mr. <HI>James Sutherland,</HI> its then Intendant, publi&s;hed an Account of it in 1684. under the Title of <HI>Hortus Medicus Edinburgen&s;is.</HI> They are all di&s;|po&s;ed into the mo&s;t rational Method, according to that of the learned Dr. <HI>Mori&s;on,</HI> the late <HI>Oxford</HI> Botani&s;t, a Native of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The City is govern'd by a Lord-Provo&s;t, who&s;e Office is much the &s;ame as that of the Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI>; four Bailiffs, who, be&s;ides the Power of Aldermen in the Government of this City, have that of Sheriffs, and a common Council, ordinarily con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-five Per&s;ons, but extraordina|rily of thirty-eight. All the&s;e are cho&s;en annually; and the Provo&s;t, Dean of Guild, and Trea&s;urer, are to be Merchants; or if any Trade&s;man be cho&s;en, he mu&s;t quit his Trade, and not return to it with|out Leave of the Magi&s;trates and Town-Council; and he mu&s;t al&s;o be a Year or two a Member of the common Council. No one is to continue in the Council above two Years at a time, except he be a Member of it by virtue of a &s;uperior Office. The Bailiffs are to be cho&s;en indifferently out of twelve Candidates propo&s;ed, and none is to be elected Deacon of any of the fourteen incorporated Trades, except he has been Ma&s;ter of his Trade two Years at lea&s;t; and
<PB N="79" REF="80">
mu&s;t not continue Deacon above two Years at a time. The fourteen incorporated Trades are;

The Magi&s;trates are cho&s;en annually upon the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> next after <HI>Michaelmas-day,</HI> by thirty-eight Electors, whereof twenty are to be Merchants and Trade&s;men, who are to chu&s;e &s;uch as in their Con|&s;cience they think be&s;t qualify'd; and the&s;e Magi|&s;trates, and the Town-Council, have the Admini&s;tra|tion of the Government, except in &s;ome re&s;erved Ca&s;es; as the Election of Magi&s;trates, Dean of Guild and Trea&s;urer, and &s;etting of Fews or Lea&s;es, giving Boundaries and Places, and other publick Matters; in which Ca&s;es they are to con&s;ult the fourteen Deacons of Trades.</P>
<P>None of the Merchants or Traders are to have any particular Conventions, or make any By-laws among them&s;elves without Con&s;ent of the Magi&s;trates and Town-Council, except to chu&s;e their own Deacons at the appointed Time, to make Per&s;ons free of their Trade, or to try their Work; and one of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for Parliament was always to be cho&s;en out of the Trade&s;men, and another out of the Merchants. The Auditors of Accounts are to be cho&s;en out of an equal Number of both. The Lord-Provo&s;t, Dean of Guild, and Trea&s;urer, are not to continue longer than two Years at a time; and the Bailiff mu&s;t be one Year a Bailiff, one Year old Bailiff, and one Year free of Office.

<P>And here it will be proper to take notice of the notorious Riot committed in this City on the 7th of <HI>Sept.</HI> 1736. in relation to Capt. <HI>Porteous,</HI> which made &s;o much Noi&s;e, and brought down upon this famous City the Re&s;entment of the Legi&s;lature of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;e was this: One <HI>Andrew Wil&s;on</HI> was con|demned for a Robbery of the publick Money, com|mitted on the Highway; and on <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the 14th of <HI>April</HI> 1736. the Day appointed for his Ex|ecution, the Magi&s;trates, being apprehen&s;ive that a Re&s;cue would be attempted, ordered Capt. <HI>John Porteous,</HI> at the Head of a Detachment of the City Guard, to attend the Execution; and Powder and Ball were delivered to them for that Purpo&s;e. That while <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> was hanging, the Populace, in&s;i&s;ting he &s;hould be cut down before the u&s;ual Time, and being refu&s;ed, attempted to do it by Force, and meeting Oppo&s;ition from the Captain and his Guard, they outrageou&s;ly pelted them with Stones, and hurt &s;everal of the Detachment. That hereupon the Captain order'd them, as he was accus'd, but which he deny'd, to fire; and upon the Mob continuing their In&s;ults, and the Captain's Men firing over their Heads to intimidate them, the Captain order'd them to level their Pieces, and fired him&s;elf, both which however he deny'd; and by that means &s;ix Per&s;ons were mortally wounded, and fourteen others very de&s;perately maimed and hurt. That hereupon the Captain was brought to his Tryal, and on a very &s;olemn Hearing, was found guilty of firing a Gun him&s;elf, and ordering his Men to fire; and &s;o was condemn'd to be hang'd upon a Gibbet, on the
<PB N="81" REF="82">
8th of <HI>Sept.</HI> 1736. The Captain drew up a Petition to her late Maje&s;ty, then Regent of the Kingdom, in the Ab&s;ence of the King; and in&s;i&s;ted on his Innocency, praying for Mercy; and great Appli|cation having been made to her Maje&s;ty for changing the Sentence to Tran&s;portation, a Reprieve for &s;ix Weeks, was granted. Which arriving, on the 2d of <HI>September,</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> occa&s;ion'd the mo&s;t extraordinary Riot that ever was known or heard of, all Circum&s;tances con&s;idered, except that at <HI>York</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> mentioned in its Place.</P>
<P>For, on the 7th of <HI>September,</HI> the Night before the Captain was to be executed, had he not been reprieved, about ten at Night, &s;ome Men by Surprize enter'd the City, &s;eized all the Fire-arms, Battle-axes, and Drums belonging to the City Guard.</P>
<P>The Mob hereupon, in a few Minutes, lock'd and &s;ecur'd all the City Gates, and with Drums beating an Alarm, attempted with Hammers, and other In&s;truments, to force open the [<HI>Tolbooth</HI>] Pri|&s;on-door: But failing, they de&s;perately &s;et Fire to it, and burnt it. When they entered the Pri&s;on, they made the Under-keeper open the double Locks of the Apartment where the Captain was. He begg'd in vain to be &s;pared till the Afternoon; and making &s;ome Re&s;i&s;tance, they dragg'd him down Stairs by his Legs, and hurried him away. This was about eleven at Night, and they march'd out with Lights before them. In their Way to the <HI>Gra&s;s-market,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by a Barber's Sign-po&s;t, &s;ome called out to hang him up there; but it was re&s;olved to hang him where the Murders, for which he was condemn'd, were committed. So they proceeded to the Place where, on Executions, the Gallows u&s;ed to be fixed; where they kept him above a Quarter of an Hour, till they open'd a Shop, and brought out a Rope, one End of which they threw over a Sign|po&s;t about 20 Feet high. He de&s;ir'd &s;ome Time to
<PB N="82" REF="83">
prepare for Death; but was an&s;wer'd, They would al|low him no more than tho&s;e had who were &s;hot. They then pull'd him up in the Dre&s;s in which they found him; <HI>viz.</HI> a Night-gown and Cap: His Hands not being ty'd, he fix'd them betwixt his Neck and the Rope, whereupon one with a Battle-ax &s;truck at his Hands. They then let him down, and he having on two Shirts, they wrapt one of them about his Face, and ty'd his Arms with his Night-gown, and then pull'd him up again, where he hung next Morning till Day-light; when he was cut down, and carried to the <HI>Grey-fryars</HI> Church. Upon in|&s;pecting his Body, it appear'd his Left-&s;houlder was wounded, his Back di&s;colour'd, and his Neck broke. He deny'd his giving Orders to fire, with his la&s;t Breath.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erv'd, that this Mob was under a &s;tricter Concert, and better Conduct, than u&s;ual; for, march|ing along to the Execution, the unhappy Man ob|&s;erving a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, he gave him a Pur&s;e of twenty-three Guineas, which he de&s;ir'd might be deliver'd to his Brother; which they offer'd not to ob&s;truct. They left indeed the Pri&s;on|doors open, whereby &s;everal Pri&s;oners e&s;caped; but after they had perpetrated the unprecedented Fact, they left the Arms and Drums at the Place of Exe|cution, where they were found next Morning. Moreover, during the Tumult, Parties of armed Men, with Drums, patrolled in the different Streets, to prevent any Surprize from the King's Forces quarter'd in the Suburbs. The Magi&s;trates, attended with &s;everal of the Burge&s;&s;es, attempted, as was &s;aid, to di&s;per&s;e the Mob; but were pelted with Stones, and threaten'd with Fire-arms, if they did not re|tire. After the Execution was over, they went to the Lord-Provo&s;t's Hou&s;e, and telling him they were &s;atisfy'd, departed, without offering any other Violence. Nay, it was &s;aid, that to do the Act
<PB N="83" REF="84">
with more Decency, having no Clergyman, they order'd two of the grave&s;t among them to exhort the unhappy Man, as they carry'd him to Exe|cution.</P>
<P>The Boldne&s;s, Secrecy, and Conduct of this En|terprize, was the mo&s;t extraordinary In&s;tance of its kind that ever was known; and the Keeper de|claring, that tho' the Per&s;ons who fir&s;t enter'd, and demanded the Keys, wore Leather Aprons, but were otherwi&s;e well dre&s;s'd, it made &s;ome imagine, that Per&s;ons above the vulgar Rank had a hand in it.</P>
<P>Be this as it would, the In&s;ult on the Sovereign Authority was too flagrant to be overlook'd. Pro|clamations, with Rewards of 200<HI>l.</HI> Sterling, were i&s;&s;ued for apprehending the Rioters; and when the Parliament met, vigorous Mea&s;ures were taken in the Affair. The Lord-Provo&s;t was order'd up to <HI>London</HI> in Cu&s;tody, the Magi&s;trates were order'd up al&s;o, to attend the Hou&s;e of Lords at <HI>London</HI>; and finally, an Act of Parliament was pa&s;&s;ed, to di&s;able <HI>Alexander Wil&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> from holding or enjoying any Office of Magi&s;tracy in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> or <HI>Great Britain</HI>; a new Provo&s;t was injoin'd to be cho&s;en, and a Fine of Two thou&s;and Pounds levied upon the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for the U&s;e of the Widow of Captain <HI>Porteous,</HI> as Puni&s;hments for their re&s;pective Re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;&s;es in not endeavouring to prevent this In&s;ult on Sovereignty, and all lawful Authority.</P>
<P>This Act, however, pa&s;&s;ed not without great De|bates; and as &s;ome thought it impo&s;&s;ible to prevent a De&s;ign &s;o well concerted, and &s;o &s;uddenly and boldly executed, they were of Opinion, that the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was treated with too much Severity. But, after all, it could not be expected, but that the Legi&s;lature &s;hould &s;hew the highe&s;t Indignation again&s;t &s;o in&s;olent a Riot.</P>
<P>This Act was pa&s;&s;ed in the 10th Year of his Ma|je&s;ty, and in the &s;ame Se&s;&s;ion was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed another,
<PB N="84" REF="85">
for the more effectual bringing to Ju&s;tice any Per|&s;ons concern'd in this &s;trange Attempt; in which Fugitives not &s;urrendering were made liable to Death: The concealing of tho&s;e who &s;hould be declared Fugitives, was al&s;o made Death: This Act was to be read before Morning Sermon in every Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> every <HI>Sunday</HI> for a Year: Impeachers were to be encouraged, and di&s;charged; Informers re|warded with 200<HI>l.</HI> Sterling for every Per&s;on they &s;hould convict, and be admitted Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But &s;o &s;ecretly was this dark Affair managed, that I don't remember any body has &s;uffer'd on the Ac|count; and the reading of the Act was but indif|ferently dige&s;ted by many in that Kingdom.</P>
<P>Greater Severity was intended; &s;uch as the im|pri&s;oning, as well as di&s;qualifying the Lord-Provo&s;t for a Year; for aboli&s;hing the Town-Guard of the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and for taking away the Gates of the <HI>Nether-bow</HI> Port, and keeping open the &s;ame. But the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was happily &s;aved from this Di&s;grace.</P>
<P>It is now Time to return to our Subject.</P>
<P>The Churches in this populous City and Suburbs are Twelve, including the Chapel of the Ca&s;tle: The Mini&s;ters about Twenty; be&s;ides Three Chapels.</P>

<P><PB N="85" REF="86">There are al&s;o about twenty Meeting-hou&s;es of the Epi&s;copal Party; for tho' Pre&s;bytery be the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;ince the Revolution, yet a great Number of the People of all Ranks are not of that Opinion, e&s;pecially in the Nothern Parts.</P>
<P>The Churches are always very full; for the People in this Country do not wander about on the Sabbath-days, as in <HI>England.</HI> They have al&s;o one very good Cu&s;tom as to their Behaviour in Church, which I wi&s;h was practi&s;ed in <HI>England:</HI> If any Per&s;on comes in after Divine Service is begun, he takes no Notice of any body, nor any body of him; whereas we make our Bows and Cringes, even in the Middle of our Prayers. Not that the <HI>Scots</HI> want Manners; for they &s;hew them more properly after the Sermon is done, and the Ble&s;&s;ing given, when they all look round upon their Friends, e&s;pecially to Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction, and make their Civilities as courteou&s;ly as we do.</P>
<P>The City is encompa&s;&s;ed with a kind of <HI>Roman</HI> Wall on every Side, except the North, where it is &s;ecur'd by a Lake.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle only, and the Palace, remain to be mentioned. The fir&s;t is &s;trong both by Situation and Art, but far from being impregnable, as has been experienced more than once. It was formerly called the <HI>Maiden</HI> Ca&s;tle, becau&s;e the <HI>Picti&s;h</HI> Kings kept their Daughters in it. Still more antiently, it was called <HI>Alatum Ca&s;trum,</HI> or the <HI>Winged Ca&s;tle,</HI> per|haps from its Form, and &s;tanding on &s;o high a Hill, as it were in the Air: It is &s;ituated at the We&s;t-end of the City, as we have &s;aid, where the Rock ri&s;es to a high and large Summit. 'Tis inacce&s;&s;ible on the South, We&s;t, and North. The Entrance is from the Town, where the Rock is al&s;o very high, and is defended by a round Battery, and an Out|work at the Foot of it. In the Ca&s;tle is a Royal Palace of hewn Stone, where are kept the Regalia,
<PB N="86" REF="87">
and chief Records of State, as al&s;o the Magazine for the Arms and Ammunition of the Nation.</P>
<P>A Chapel is al&s;o in it for the U&s;e of the Gari&s;on; and it is furni&s;hed with Water by two Wells in the Rock. From the Ca&s;tle is a delightful Pro&s;pect over the City and neighbouring Country, and to the River of <HI>Forth,</HI> from whence it is &s;aluted by &s;uch Men of War as come to anchor in <HI>Leith</HI> Road. The Governor is always a Per&s;on of prime Quality, and General of the Forces.</P>
<P>The Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, Fort-Ma|jor, and &s;ome other Officers, have very good Apart|ments; and there are deep Vaults in the Rock, which, they &s;ay, are Bomb-proof.</P>
<P>The Palace, called <HI>Holy-rood-hou&s;e,</HI> is a very hand&s;ome Building, rather convenient than large. The Entrance is maje&s;tick, and over the Gate is a large Apartment, which the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> claims as Hereditary Keeper of the Palace. Within this is a large, irregular Court, where are Coach-hou&s;es and Stables, which, I think, are very improperly placed here; for if they had &s;tood farther off, either in the Park, or without the Out-gate, and a Barrack, or Guard-hou&s;e, like the Hor&s;e-Guards at <HI>White-hall,</HI> built in their Stead, it would have been much more becoming a Royal Palace.</P>
<P>This may be called the <HI>E&s;curial</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> being both a Royal Palace, and an Abbey, founded by King <HI>David</HI> I. for Canons Regular of St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> who named it <HI>Holy-rood-hou&s;e.</HI> The Entrance from the great outer Court, already de&s;cribed, is adorned with Pillars of hewn Stone, under a Cupola in the Form of an Imperial Crown, balu&s;traded on each Side a-top. The Fore-part has two Wings, on each of which are two Turrets; that towards the North was built by King <HI>James</HI> V. who&s;e Name it bears in Letters of Gold, and that towards the South (as well as all the re&s;t) by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. whereof Sir
<PB N="87" REF="88">
<HI>William Bruce</HI> was Architect. The inner Court is very &s;tately, all of Free-&s;tone well hewed, with Piazzas round it, from which there are Entries into the &s;everal Apartments, truly royal and magnificent; but above all, the Long Gallery is very remarkable, being adorned with the Pictures of all the <HI>Scots</HI> Kings from <HI>Fergus</HI> I. to <HI>James</HI> VII. inclu&s;ive, by ma&s;terly Hands. Tho&s;e Kings that were eminent, and all the Race of <HI>Stuarts,</HI> are in full Length; the others are but Bu&s;to's.</P>
<P>You turn to the Right to the Royal Apartments, as at <HI>St. James</HI>'s; and the Stair-ca&s;e and Guard-room run exactly as there, but far more lofty and magnificent. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Apartment (as He|reditary Keeper) is in the double Tower to the North, and the great Council Chamber in the Tower to the South. The Earl of <HI>Perth,</HI> when Chancellor, in the late King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, converted this noble Room into a Popi&s;h Chapel, and his Apartment be|hind it was the Je&s;uits School, which being demoli&s;hed by the Mob at the Revolution, has been neglected ever &s;ince. The Chimney-pieces are all of Marble, and the Apartments two Pair of Stairs for the Officers of State are very well kept, being lent to many of the Nobility, who now live in them.</P>
<P>Behind this Palace, the Conventual Church makes a Wing to the North, and Ea&s;tward from it is <HI>St. Anne's-yard,</HI> which was de&s;igned to be branched out into Gravel-walks, adorned with Statues; but the Revolution coming on, attended with a long and expen&s;ive War, and afterwards the Union with <HI>Eng|land,</HI> prevented its being put in Execution.</P>
<P>The Church is very high to the Roof, and the Pillars are as exqui&s;ite as tho&s;e of <HI>St. George</HI>'s Chapel at <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> It is an antient, very reverend, but de|clining Fabrick, and u&s;ed only as a Burial-place for Per&s;ons of Quality. In it King <HI>James</HI> VI. was
<PB N="88" REF="89">
crowned by Bi&s;hop <HI>Hepburn,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <HI>John Knox,</HI> as was King <HI>Charles</HI> I. by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Spot&s;wood.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> VII. began to erect a magnificent Throne here for the Sovereign, and twelve Stalls for the twelve Knights Companions of the mo&s;t noble and antient Order of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> or <HI>the Thi&s;tle,</HI> which he had revived after a long Di&s;u&s;e: The fine&s;t Carvers and other Ma&s;ters in <HI>Europe</HI> were employed in it. But at the Revolution the Rabble demoli&s;hed all, and ran&s;acking every Corner, fell upon a Vault quite built up, &s;o as not to be known what it cer|tainly was, in which were found the Bodies of King <HI>James</HI> V. and <HI>Magdalene</HI> of <HI>Valois,</HI> his fir&s;t Queen, together with Lord <HI>Darnley</HI>'s, all embalmed and pre&s;erved in Pickle; whereby the Malice of <HI>Buchanan,</HI> and others, to blacken Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Memory, was di&s;covered; for &s;he gave him a Royal Funeral &s;uitable to his high Dignity, and did not carry him by Porters privately to a common Burial-place, as that Author had a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>The adjoining Park is about four Miles in Circum|ference; but, which is very odd, there is neither Deer nor Tree in it, and, tho' it be very mountain|ous, affords good Pa&s;ture for Cattle. There is a very high and craggy Rock in it, near half a Mile to the Top, called <HI>Arthur</HI>'s <HI>Seat,</HI> from <HI>Arthur,</HI> the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> King, who, they &s;ay, u&s;ed to view the adja|cent Country from thence.</P>
<P>This Palace, or Abbey, and Park, is Sanctuary for Debtors; and no one, but by the King's Order only, can arre&s;t any Man, who has entered his Name in an Office kept there for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that according to &s;everal Acts of Parliament, divers great publick Works have been undertaken, and mo&s;tly brought to Per|fection, for the Benefit of the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and Town of <HI>Leith,</HI> and their Vicinities, within the&s;e few Years pa&s;t, by Benefit partly of the ea&s;y <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="90">
Tax of Two-pence <HI>Scots</HI> on every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale and Beer &s;old in the &s;aid City: And partly of the Di&s;continuance of what they called the <HI>Petty-port-Cu&s;toms</HI> there; &s;ome of which Works are as follow:</P>
<P>The Magi&s;trates have, at a great Expence, col|lected the Springs, and renew'd the Pipes which convey Water to the Town; rebuilt the Fountains in the High-&s;treet; inlarged the Harbour of <HI>Leith,</HI> and deepened its Chanel; have built &s;everal hundred Feet of Key there in a very &s;ufficient manner; have built two new Churches; have paved, at a great Expence, with Cau&s;ey-&s;tone, the whole High-&s;treets and Ways leading to their City; have made a good Highway from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to <HI>Leith</HI>; have built a large Workhou&s;e for the Poor, to be employed in Manufacture, and endow'd the &s;ame with 300<HI>l. per Annum.</HI> Al&s;o have &s;ettled Salaries on the Law Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and Stipends on the Mi|ni&s;ters of the two new Churches; have rebuilt the City Walls; and taken Mea&s;ures for paying their old Debts, as well as tho&s;e incurred on account of the Rebellion in 1715.</P>
<P>They further propo&s;ed al&s;o, by means of this Fund, to narrow the noxious Lake on the North-&s;ide of the City, commonly called the <HI>North Loch,</HI> into a Canal of running Water; to erect a Street of Communi|cation to the Fields, on the North-&s;ide of the City; to build a proper Hall for the Court of Ju&s;ticiary, and an Edifice for the publick Records; to e&s;tabli&s;h a Salary to a Profe&s;&s;or of Civil Hi&s;tory, and <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities; another to a Profe&s;&s;or of <HI>Scots</HI> Law, and other publick-&s;pirited Purpo&s;es. And all this is provided for and e&s;tabli&s;hed by an Act, which pa&s;&s;ed 9 <HI>George</HI> I. <HI>Anno</HI> 1722. confirming and con|tinuing a <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Act of Parliament 1693. and an Act of 3 <HI>George</HI> I. to which Act of 9 <HI>George</HI> I. we refer the Reader.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91">I &s;hall ju&s;t &s;top to mention an odd Circum&s;tance that was of fatal Con&s;equence to the poor Dogs about <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and <HI>Leith,</HI> in the Month of <HI>April</HI> 1738. A mad Bull-bitch having bitten many Dogs in the <HI>Fle&s;h-market,</HI> to prevent the bad Con&s;equences that might follow, the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> i&s;&s;ued a Proclamation, ordering all the Dogs in that Incor|poration to be forthwith put to Death, under Penalty of 5<HI>l.</HI> Sterling, and Impri&s;onment to the Owners, for twelve Calendar Months; and to prohibit all Per&s;ons from keeping Dogs for thirty Days from that Time: And the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Leith</HI> joining in the Order, nothing was to be &s;een for &s;everal Days, but cha&s;ing, hacking, &s;la&s;hing, hanging, and drowning of Dogs; and great Lamentations were heard from divers, for the Lo&s;s of their favourite Puppies; for with &s;uch Zeal was this Order executed, that the Ladies had enough to do to pre&s;erve any of their Lap-dogs; and, as it was, many Gentlemen got rid by it of formidable Rivals.</P>
<P>I &s;hall al&s;o take notice here of the Mi&s;chiefs done by a terrible Storm, which happen'd <HI>Jan.</HI> 14. 1739. in this City, and the adjacent Parts, of the like of which we have hardly any Example. The Wind began to blow pretty hard between Eleven and Twelve the preceding Night, and before One it ro&s;e to a complete Hurri|cane, and continued with &s;urpri&s;ing Fury till Four in the Morning.</P>
<P>As the Hou&s;es in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> are built high, they &s;uffered con&s;iderable Damage. The Leads which cover'd the &s;tately Building in the <HI>Parliament-Clo&s;e,</HI> were carried off the Roofs, &s;ome of them more than forty Feet in Dimen&s;ions. The <HI>Canon-gate</HI> Church &s;uffered exceedingly, and the fine Portico there was almo&s;t demoli&s;h'd. The Con&s;ternation was heighten'd by the Alarm of the Fire-Drum; for the Brewery at the Ea&s;t-end of the Meadow, belonging to one Mr. <HI>Bry&s;on,</HI> taking Fire, the Wind increa&s;ed
<PB N="91" REF="92">
the Flame, in&s;omuch that the Water-works proved &s;o many u&s;ele&s;s Machines; &s;o that the Brewery and Hou&s;e were con&s;umed, and &s;ome low Hou&s;es at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance catching the Flame, were like|wi&s;e reduced to A&s;hes. Nor was the Fire confined to that Quarter; for, near the <HI>Canon-mills,</HI> on the oppo&s;ite Part of the Town, a Farm-hou&s;e, belong|ing to one Mrs. <HI>Angus,</HI> likewi&s;e took Fire, which con&s;um'd it together with the Corn-&s;tacks and Out|hou&s;es. The&s;e Fires happen'd not thro' any Negli|gence, but were intirely occa&s;ion'd by the Impetuo|&s;ity of the Wind, which having got Entrance to the Hou&s;es, &s;catter'd the Fire, and &s;et it in a Glow. A large new Hou&s;e at the Back of the <HI>Canon-gate,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of five Stories, was intirely beaten down. This was the more remarkable, as it had been twice de&s;troy'd before; and the Owner had built it &s;o &s;trongly, that &s;he promis'd her&s;elf Security again&s;t any Accidents of that kind. The Buildings in the Ca&s;tle were prodigiou&s;ly damaged; their fine Lead Coverings were carried off, and thrown upon the Rocks; the Magazine was almo&s;t demoli&s;h'd, and other con&s;iderable Damages done. The Hou&s;es at the <HI>Multries-hill,</HI> which lay much expo&s;ed, were almo&s;t all unroofed, and the new Play-hou&s;e was quite uncover'd.</P>
<P>This violent Tempe&s;t confined not it&s;elf to this City: At <HI>Leith</HI> it produced likewi&s;e very di&s;mal Effects; &s;everal Hou&s;es were damaged, and the End of one &s;truck down; the Lead-mill was uncover'd; &s;everal of the Ships in the Harbour broke loo&s;e, and with &s;uch Violence, that they carried along with them the great Iron Rings to which they were fa&s;ten'd.</P>
<P>The Shire of <HI>Aire</HI> produced no le&s;s di&s;mal Ac|counts; at <HI>Irvine</HI> it blew &s;o hard, that many of the Ships &s;uffer'd much, and many of the Buildings in the Town were thrown down. At <HI>Aire</HI> the Lo&s;s was much greater; a general Havock was made among
<PB N="92" REF="93">
the Hou&s;es and Shipping, mo&s;t of which &s;uffer'd; and the <HI>Anne</HI> Galley, bound for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> drove on Shore, and was da&s;h'd to Pieces; but the Crew were happily &s;aved.</P>
<P>The like di&s;mal Account they gave from the <HI>Mer&s;e,</HI> where the Storm occa&s;ion'd a terrible De|&s;truction, few Hou&s;es being left unde&s;troy'd, and &s;everal Churches blown down, and Numbers &s;mo|thered in the Ruins, and a general Havock made among the Sheep and Cattle.</P>
<P>This Storm did very great Damage in other Parts of the I&s;land, in <HI>South</HI> as well as <HI>North Britain</HI>; but the Effects of it at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were &s;o terribly remarkable, that we thought the above Particulars would not be ami&s;s to in&s;ert here.</P>
<P>Now we are on the Subject of melancholy Acci|dents, the Reader will excu&s;e me for the following Account of a very deplorable one, which happen'd at <HI>Kirkaldy, Jan.</HI> 7. 1739-40.</P>
<P>It is a well-known Cu&s;tom, that in the&s;e Parts, the fir&s;t <HI>Monday</HI> of the Year is always ob&s;erved with uncommon Gaiety and Mirth, and in Con&s;equence becomes a Holy-day to Apprentices and Servants, fourteen of which, belonging to <HI>Path-head,</HI> a little Village adjacent to <HI>Kirkaldy,</HI> having got a little Money, went to divert them&s;elves with a common Amu&s;ement among Boys, by throwing up <HI>Thi&s;tles or Crowns:</HI> The Place they cho&s;e was a Cave, or a large Hollow below a rocky Eminence. As they were thus innocently amu&s;ing them&s;elves, the Rock tumbled down, and cru&s;h'd them to-pieces. 'Tis &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to form an Idea of the gha&s;tly Sight which their mangled Bodies exhibited. Parents could not di&s;tingui&s;h the Corp&s;es of their own Children. The Parts of &s;ome who were clo&s;e together when the Rock fell, were &s;o mingled, that there was no Di|&s;tinction; and the Carnage was the mo&s;t di&s;mal that could be imagined. One e&s;cap'd by his being at a
<PB N="93" REF="94">
greater Di&s;tance from the Rock; but his Leg was broke in a va&s;t Number of Places. This fatal Cata|&s;trophe cau&s;ed an extraordinary Grief, e&s;pecially as &s;ome Parents lo&s;t two, others all their Children.</P>
<P>The following odd Accident happen'd at <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> in <HI>September</HI> 1740. A Soldier belonging to the Regiment in the <HI>Canon-gate,</HI> went to the King's Park on a Sheep-&s;tealing Expedition, where he un|luckily happen'd to engage with a large head&s;trong Ram, near one of the Precipices at <HI>Arthur</HI>'s <HI>Seat,</HI> mention'd above, which pu&s;h'd him headlong from the Top of the Rock, &s;o that they both fell down together, and had their Necks broken. The un|happy Fellow was found next Morning with a Hand|ful of the Ram's Wool clench'd in his Fi&s;t.</P>
<P>We next vi&s;ited <HI>Leith,</HI> the Sea-port of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> which is a large and populous Town, or rather two Towns; for the River or Harbour parts them: but they are joined by a &s;tately Stone-bridge, to which Ships of Burden may come, and, at High-water, lay their Sides clo&s;e to the Shore.</P>
<P>Here is a very fine Quay, well wharfed up with Stone, and fenced with Piles, able to di&s;charge much more Bu&s;ine&s;s than the Place can &s;upply, tho' the Trade is far from being incon&s;iderable. At the Mouth of the Harbour is a very long and well-built Pier, or Head, which runs out beyond the Land a great way, and defends the Entrance into the Har|bour from being filled up with Sand, as it would otherwi&s;e be, when the Wind blows hard at North-ea&s;t. There are al&s;o Ranges of Piles, or Break-waters, as the Seamen call them, on the other Side of the Harbour, all which are kept in good Repair; and by this means the Harbour is pre&s;erved, and kept open, in &s;pite of a flat Shore, and a large Swell of the Sea.</P>
<P>On the other Side of the Bridge are the Remains of a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, built by <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> to com|mand
<PB N="94" REF="95">
the Port, which is not yet &s;o far demoli&s;hed, but that a little Expence would &s;oon re&s;tore it. Here the late Rebel Highlanders made a bold Stop, and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for one Night; but not finding their Friends in the City in any Condition to join them, and the Troops preparing to attack them, they quitted it in the Night, and marched off to the Earl of <HI>Winton</HI>'s Hou&s;e, as I have already related.</P>
<P>This Town was once very &s;trong; for the <HI>French</HI> held it for &s;ome Years again&s;t the Reformers, but were at la&s;t driven out by an Army which Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> &s;ent from <HI>England</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Prote&s;tants. It is under the Juri&s;diction of the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> and is govern'd by a Bailiff under them.</P>
<P>At <HI>Leith</HI> the Firth is &s;even Miles over, and holds that Breadth for five or &s;ix Miles; but is narrower a little beyond <HI>Cramond,</HI> and at <HI>Queen's-ferry</HI> is re|duced to two Miles in Breadth. This Place is a very good Town as well as Ferry, and a Corporation, or Royal Burgh. Near the Water of <HI>Leith</HI> is a good Copper Mine.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cramond,</HI> ju&s;t mention'd, and in the Lands of <HI>Ingle&s;town,</HI> as well as at other Places in this County, <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities have been found; particu|larly, near the former Place were dug up two Stones, late in Sir <HI>Robert Sibbald</HI>'s Yard at <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> upon one of which is a Laurel Crown, and on the other a <HI>Roman Securis:</HI> they are &s;up|po&s;ed to have been Part of a Pillar erected in <HI>Domitian</HI>'s Time, when <HI>Agricola</HI> was in the&s;e Parts. Near this Place, in the Beginning of <HI>De|cember</HI> 1740. a Whale between 50 and 60 Feet in Length, and 16 in Depth, was ca&s;t on Shore; who&s;e Mate afterwards, tumbling about above the Ferry, was heard to make a hideous Moan, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, for its Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and this Town the Country is thronged with the Seats of Noblemen and Gentle|men;
<PB N="95" REF="96">
among which the Marquis of <HI>Annandale</HI> has a very pretty one, with a fine Garden inclo&s;ed with a Brick Wall, a thing hardly to be &s;een any-where el&s;e in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the want of which is the Rea&s;on why the Wall-fruit does not thrive &s;o well as it would otherwi&s;e do; for the Stone does not hold the Warmth of the Sun, after it is gone, as the Bricks do.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of this Part of the Country is <HI>Hop|ton</HI> Hou&s;e, built upon a delightful Plain, on the Bank of the River. It was originally a Square, but there are two Wings lately joined to it, which add greatly to the Beauty of the Building. The Situation is &s;o extremely good, and gives &s;o elegant a Pro&s;pect as well to the Sea as to the Land, that nothing can be finer. It is exqui&s;itely fini&s;hed both within and without; and there are &s;ome Pieces of curious Painting in it, be&s;ides a great Number of Family Pictures. The Stables and Riding-place are by far the fine&s;t and mo&s;t magnificent in <HI>Scotland</HI>; and his Lord&s;hip, who de|lights in good Hor&s;es, has the be&s;t, without Compa|ri&s;on, in all the Country. <HI>Hawthornden</HI> al&s;o is cele|brated for its Caves hewn out of the Rock, and <HI>Ro&s;lin</HI> for a great &s;tately Chapel.</P>
<P>From hence the Firth widens again, and &s;oon after is three or four Miles wide, and makes a &s;afe and deep Road, with good Anchor-ground, where, if there was a Trade to an&s;wer it, a thou&s;and Sail of Ships of any Burden might &s;afely ride.</P>
<P>On the South-&s;hore, upon a narrow Point of Land running into the Water, &s;tands <HI>Blackne&s;s</HI> Ca&s;tle, wherein State-pri&s;oners were confined in former Times, e&s;pecially &s;uch as were taken up for reli|gious Differences, many of whom mi&s;erably peri&s;hed here, either by the Unhealthine&s;s of the Place, Want of Conveniencies, or &s;omething wor&s;e. This Ca&s;tle might be of U&s;e, if the Harbour was frequented; but
<PB N="96" REF="97">
as it is not, there &s;eems to be no Occa&s;ion for it at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Farther We&s;t is <HI>Borrows-toun-ne&s;s,</HI> a long Town, con&s;i&s;ting only of one Street, which is extended along the Shore, clo&s;e to the Water. It has been, and &s;till is, a Town of the greate&s;t Trade to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France</HI> of any in <HI>Scotland,</HI> except <HI>Leith</HI>; but it &s;uffers very much of late by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade being carried on &s;o much by way of <HI>England.</HI> However, if the <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> Merchants would &s;ettle a Trade to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh</HI> in the Firth, by bringing their foreign Goods by Land to <HI>Alloway,</HI> and exporting them from thence, as they propo&s;ed &s;ome Time ago, 'tis very likely the <HI>Borrows-toun-ne&s;s</HI> Men would come into Bu&s;ine&s;s again; for as they have the mo&s;t Shipping, &s;o they are the be&s;t Seamen in the Firth, and are very good Pilots for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norway.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS I entered the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Scotland</HI> at <HI>Berwick upon Tweed,</HI> and have car|ried on my Account through the <HI>Lo|thians,</HI> &s;o, having travelled over the We&s;t Part at another Journey, when I went from <HI>England</HI> by a different Road, I &s;hall here give you the Particulars of that al&s;o.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the River <HI>E&s;k,</HI> or (as it is commonly called) the <HI>Solway Firth,</HI> beyond <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> we entered <HI>Scot|land</HI> on the Side of <HI>Dumfries&s;hire.</HI> The Divi&s;ion of this County into <HI>E&s;kdale, Nith&s;dale,</HI> and <HI>Annan|dale,</HI> is but the ordinary marking out the Rivers <HI>E&s;k, Annan,</HI> and <HI>Nith,</HI> as I ob&s;erved of the Rivers <HI>Tee&s;dale, Tyndale, Swaledale,</HI> and others, in the North of <HI>England</HI>; for the whole Province makes but one Shire; <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Dumfries.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="99">The <HI>E&s;k</HI> is a pretty large River, and gives Name to the South-ea&s;t Part of this County; but we &s;aw very little near it, worth our Notice, except <HI>Kir&s;op,</HI> a very &s;mall Town on a River of the &s;ame Name, which afterwards falls into the <HI>E&s;k,</HI> and is famous for being the Place where, by a Treaty, after the Battle of <HI>Pinkey,</HI> the Limits or Borders of the two King|doms were &s;ettled; tho' the Borderers did not long ob&s;erve it, but robbed and plundered one another upon all Occa&s;ions, as Opportunity offered.</P>
<P>This River &s;oon leaves <HI>Scotland,</HI> and running into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Border, empties it&s;elf into the <HI>Solway</HI> Firth, which receives all the Rivers on this Part of the I&s;land, as well from <HI>England</HI> as from <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Place of Note we came to in <HI>Scotland</HI> was <HI>Annand,</HI> the chief Town of <HI>Annandale,</HI> which, being a Sea-port, and having a good Harbour, was once a Town of pretty good Trade; but it was often taken by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who, at la&s;t, burnt it to the Ground in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. from which it never recovered. Here was a good Salmon Fi&s;hery, and a Trade to <HI>Ireland</HI> by the <HI>I&s;le of Man</HI>; but mo&s;t of the Merchants, and Men of Sub&s;tance, being removed to <HI>Dumfries</HI> the Town continues, to all Appearance, in a State of irrevocable Decay.</P>
<P>The Town and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Lockmaben</HI> is a Royal Burgh as well as <HI>Annand.</HI> Three Parts of it are &s;urrounded by Lakes, which afford excellent Fi&s;h, and one particularly which is found no-where el&s;e. The Ca&s;tle, as well as that of <HI>Annand,</HI> is now demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ffet</HI> is remarkable for its medicinal Springs. They ri&s;e from the Top of a Rock near the Town: There are two Wells near one another. The Waters purge and vomit, and are very good again&s;t Colicky and Nephritical Pains, powerfully removing Ob|&s;tructions in the Bowels. They are applied out|wardly to Ulcers, and for Pains in the Joints. They
<PB N="99" REF="100">
have more Virtue in dry Sea&s;ons, and in Summer and Autumn, than in Winter and rainy Weather.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Rivel</HI> al&s;o de&s;erves to be mention'd, on account of a very good Salt made out of a parti|cular Sand there, which they gather up and boil.</P>
<P>From <HI>Annand,</HI> keeping the Sea as clo&s;e as we could to the Left, we went on due We&s;t to <HI>Dum|fries,</HI> a Sea-port Town at the Mouth of the River <HI>Nid,</HI> or <HI>Nith,</HI> which gives Name to the third Di|vi&s;ion of the County, called <HI>Nith&s;dale</HI>; but this Town is the Capital of the whole Shire, and in|deed of all the South-we&s;t Part of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Here, as in &s;ome few other Ports on this Side of the I&s;land, the Benefits of Commerce, obtained to this Country by the Union, appear much more vi&s;ible than on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Dumfries</HI> was always a good Town, with large Streets, and full of reputable and wealthy Merchants, who trade into foreign Parts, and employ a con|&s;iderable Number of Ships, e&s;pecially &s;ince they have embarked in Trade to <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations. This Town is al&s;o advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated for an Increa&s;e of Commerce on the River <HI>Nid,</HI> or <HI>Nith</HI>; for tho' it &s;tands near two Leagues from the Sea, yet the Tide flows up to the Town, and Ships of Burden come clo&s;e up to the Key, and about four Miles below it the large&s;t Merchant-&s;hips in <HI>Britain</HI> may ride in Safety.</P>
<P>Over the River <HI>Nith,</HI> is a very fine Stone-bridge, at this Place, with nine Arches, and &s;o broad, that two Coaches may go abrea&s;t on it. Here they have al&s;o an Exchange for the Merchants, a hand&s;ome Church, a <HI>Tolbooth</HI> or Pri&s;on, and a Town-hall for the U&s;e of the Magi&s;trates. They had formerly a Woolen Ma|nufacture here; but the Union has, in great mea|&s;ure, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the&s;e Things in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;upplying them much better and cheaper: yet, at the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Scots</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="101">
have more than an Equivalent by an open Trade to <HI>England,</HI> and all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle in this Town is very old, yet is &s;till pretty good and &s;trong. This Ca&s;tle, as well as that at <HI>Carlavrok,</HI> near the Mouth of the River, which has been a very magnificent Structure, belonged for|merly to the antient Family of the <HI>Maxwells,</HI> Earls of <HI>Nith&s;dale,</HI> the only remaining Branch of which, being unhappily embarked in the late Rebellion, and taken in Arms at <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> made his E&s;cape out of the Tower, and is now abroad, under Forfeiture.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the Town of <HI>Dumfries</HI> exerted them&s;elves in a di&s;tingui&s;hing manner for the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, in the Year 1715. fortify'd the Town at a great Expence, and provided them&s;elves with Arms and Ammunition: This involving them in a larger Debt, an Act pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>Anno</HI> 1716. for laying a Duty of Two Pennies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale or Beer &s;old within the Town and its Privileges, for paying the &s;aid Debts, and for building a new Church, the other being not capacious enough to hold the Inhabitants; and al&s;o to make a convenient Harbour there, for the Pre&s;er|vation of Ships, and Improvement of Trade.</P>
<P>This Act enabled them to make &s;ome Progre&s;s in the de&s;ign'd Projections; but the Town having been forced to rebuild Part of their old Church, the Council-hou&s;e and Pri&s;on, which were become ruinous, they were render'd unable to proceed in the mo&s;t u&s;eful Parts of their Undertaking; and as the Act expired in the 10th of King <HI>George</HI> II. they procured the &s;ame to be continued in that Se&s;&s;ion for 25 Years longer; and al&s;o an additional Duty on the Tonnage of Shipping, and on Goods imported and exported into and out of the Port of <HI>Dumfries:</HI> Which they hope will enable them completely to fini&s;h all they intended.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">There are many con&s;iderable Woods in this Coun|ty, the chief of which is <HI>Holy Wood,</HI> where was an Abbey, which gave Surname to the famous A&s;tro|loger <HI>Johannes de Sacro Bo&s;co,</HI> or <HI>Holy Wood. Drumlanrick</HI> al&s;o, the noble Palace of the Duke of <HI>Queen&s;berry,</HI> is remarkable for its Wood of Oak &s;ix Miles long.</P>
<P>At this Town the River <HI>Nith</HI> parts the Stewarty of <HI>Galloway,</HI> and the Shire of <HI>Dumfries</HI>; and in the middle of the Bridge over it, is a Gate, which is the Limit between them. This Neighbourhood of <HI>Galloway,</HI> which is a great and rich Province, pro|motes the Trade of this Place very much.</P>
<P>In <HI>November</HI> 1740. here was a great Struggle, in View to the Elections of Members for the &s;ucceeding Parliament, and the Town of <HI>Dumfries</HI> &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves by the following extraordinary Act; which we &s;hall give, without making any Remarks upon it, or the Occa&s;ion of it:<Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"At <HI>Dumfries, Augu&s;t</HI> 23. 1740.

<P>We could not pa&s;s <HI>Dumfries,</HI> without going out of our Way to &s;ee the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Drumlanrig,</HI> the fine Palace of the Duke of <HI>Queen&s;berry,</HI> ju&s;t mentioned, which &s;tands at 12 Miles Di&s;tance, upon the &s;ame River. The Vale on either Side is plea&s;ant, and tolerably good: But when the&s;e rapid Rivers over|flow
<PB N="103" REF="104">
their Banks, they do not, like <HI>Nile,</HI> or even like the <HI>Thames,</HI> and other Southern Streams, fatten and enrich the Soil; but, on the contrary, they lodge &s;o much Sand and Splinters of Stone upon the Surface of the Earth, and among the Roots of the Gra&s;s, that it &s;poils and beggars it; nay, the Water is &s;ometimes hurried on with &s;uch Force, that it wa&s;hes the be&s;t Part of the Earth away, where the Soil is light.</P>
<P><HI>Drumlanrig</HI> is like a fine Picture in a dirty Grotto, or an Eque&s;trian Statue &s;et up in a Barn. It is en|vironed with Mountains, which have the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t hideous A&s;pect of any in all the South Part of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>We were not &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed with the Height of the Mountains, and the Barrenne&s;s of the Country be|yond them, as we were with the Manners of the People, who are not &s;o poli&s;hed here, as in the other Parts of <HI>Scotland.</HI> But what was mo&s;t wonderful, was to &s;ee &s;o glorious a Palace, with &s;uch fine Gar|dens, and every thing about it &s;o truly magnificent, &s;tanding in a wild and mountainous Country, where nothing but what was de&s;olate and di&s;mal could be expected. However, the Situation, like that of <HI>Chat&s;worth</HI> in <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> is certainly a Foil to the Buildings, and &s;ets them off with greater Advantage.</P>
<P>If you come to the Palace by the Road, which leads to it from <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> you pa&s;s the River <HI>Nith,</HI> which is there both broad and deep, over a &s;tately Stone-bridge, erected by the noble Founder of the Ca&s;tle, and Builder of the Hou&s;e, the fir&s;t Duke of <HI>Queensberry.</HI></P>
<P>The Building is Four-&s;quare, with Roundels in the inner Angles of the Court, in every one of which is a Stair-ca&s;e, and a kind of Tower on the Top. It &s;tands on the Summit of a ri&s;ing Ground, which is beautifully laid out in Slopes and Terraces. At the Extent of the Gardens are Pavilions and Banquet|ing-hou&s;es
<PB N="104" REF="105">
exactly an&s;wering to one another; and the Greens, E&s;paliers, and Hedges, are in great Perfection.</P>
<P>The Apartments are fine and richly furni&s;hed. The Gallery is filled from one End to the other with Family Pictures of the Duke's Ance&s;tors, mo&s;t of them at full Length, and in their Robes of State, or of Office. <HI>William,</HI> the fir&s;t of the Family, was a younger Son of <HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>Dowglas,</HI> who got the Barony of <HI>Drumlanrig</HI> by a Deed from his Father, as his Portion, in the Time of King <HI>Robert</HI> III. He was afterwards &s;ent Emba&s;&s;ador to <HI>England</HI> to ran|&s;om King <HI>James</HI> I. who was detained there. In the Year 1708. the late Duke of <HI>Queen&s;berry</HI> was created Duke of <HI>Dover,</HI> as al&s;o Marquis of <HI>Beverly,</HI> and Baron of <HI>Rippon,</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The next Trip we made was to <HI>Galloway,</HI> &s;o called from the <HI>Gauls,</HI> from whom the antient In|habitants de&s;cended. It is divided into two different Di&s;tricts; that towards the We&s;t is called the Shire of <HI>Wigton,</HI> and the other towards the Ea&s;t, which, as I &s;aid before, begins at the middle of the Bridge of <HI>Dumfries,</HI> is called the Stewarty of <HI>Kirkcudbright,</HI> of which the <HI>Maxwells,</HI> Earls of <HI>Nith&s;dale,</HI> were Heretable Stewards. The Country hereabouts &s;eems one continued Heath, proper for Grazing &s;mall Cattle, which are generally &s;old in <HI>England</HI>; and where-ever you perceive a Grove of Trees, you may depend upon it there is a Laird's Hou&s;e near it, which are mo&s;tly old Towers of Stone, &s;trongly built, to prevent a Surprize from Inroads, which were frequent between the two Nations, before the Death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Town of Note on the Coa&s;t is <HI>Kirkcud|bright:</HI> Tho' its Situation is extremely convenient for carrying on a very advantageous Commerce, we &s;aw nothing but a Harbour without Ships, a Port without Trade, and a Fi&s;hery without Nets. This
<PB N="105" REF="106">
is owing partly to the Poverty, and partly to the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Inhabitants, who are indeed a &s;ober, grave, religious Sort of People, but have no Notion of acquiring Wealth by Trade; for they &s;trictly obey the Scriptures in the very Letter of the Text, by <HI>being content with &s;uch Things as they have.</HI> The River <HI>Dee,</HI> which enters the Sea here, and forms the Harbour, comes out of the Mountains near <HI>Carrick,</HI> and is &s;o full of Turnings and Meanders, that, tho' it is not above 70 Miles in a Line, it runs near 200 Miles in its Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Country of <HI>Galloway</HI> lies due We&s;t from <HI>Dumfries</HI>; and as that Part of it they call the <HI>Upper Galloway</HI> runs out farther into the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Seas than the re&s;t, all that Bay on the South-&s;ide may be reckoned Part of <HI>Solway Firth,</HI> as all on the North-&s;ide is called the <HI>Firth of Clyde,</HI> tho' near 50 Miles from the River it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The We&s;tern <HI>Galloway,</HI> or the Shire of <HI>Wigton,</HI> runs out with a Penin&s;ula &s;o far into the Sea, that from the utmo&s;t Shores you &s;ee the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland</HI> as plain as you &s;ee <HI>Calais</HI> from <HI>Dover. Port Patrick,</HI> which is the ordinary Place for the Ferry or Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Belfa&s;t</HI> and other Ports in <HI>Ireland,</HI> has a tolerable good Harbour, and a &s;afe Road; but there is very little U&s;e for it; the Packet-boat, and a few fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els, are the Sum of its Navigation. There was nothing here to invite our Stay; for 'tis a mean dirty homely Place: and as we had no Bu&s;ine&s;s but to &s;ee the Coa&s;t, we came away very ill &s;atisfied with our Accommodation. Upon a Hill near the Town, we could plainly &s;ee <HI>Ireland</HI> to the South-we&s;t, the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and the <HI>I&s;le of Man</HI> to the South-ea&s;t, and the <HI>I&s;le of Ila,</HI> and the Mull of <HI>Kintyre,</HI> to the North-we&s;t.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed into the Penin&s;ula, we &s;topt at <HI>Stranrawer,</HI> &s;ituate on the North-&s;ide of the I&s;thmus, which is formed by two Arms of the Sea; one on
<PB N="106" REF="107">
the North-&s;ide, called <HI>Lochrain</HI>; and the other on the South, called the Bay of <HI>Glenluce.</HI> On each Side of this I&s;thmus is an excellent Road for Ships: But we could di&s;cover no Genius in the People for Trade, or for Sea Affairs of any Kind.</P>
<P>Six Miles South of <HI>Wigton</HI> lies <HI>Whithern,</HI> the antient <HI>Candida Ca&s;a,</HI> a Royal Burgh, but very poor, e&s;pecially &s;ince the Di&s;&s;olution of the Priory. In this Town was the Seat of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Galloway,</HI> which was founded by St. <HI>Ninian</HI> about 1200 Years ago.</P>
<P>But tho' the People of <HI>Galloway,</HI> e&s;pecially on the Sea Coa&s;t, are much to blame for not falling in to Commerce, Navigation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet they are not quite idle; for they are great Cultivators of the Earth, and Breeders of Cattle, of which they &s;end above 50000 Head every Year to <HI>England.</HI> Be&s;ides, they have the be&s;t Breed of &s;trong, low, punch Hor&s;es in <HI>Britain,</HI> if not in <HI>Europe,</HI> which are from thence called <HI>Galloways.</HI> The&s;e Hor&s;es, which are very much bought up in <HI>England,</HI> are remarkable for be|ing good natural Pacers, &s;trong, ea&s;y Goers, hardy, gentle, well-broken, and, above all, not apt to tire.</P>
<P>Proceeding from <HI>Lower Galloway</HI> hither, we had like to have been driven down the Stream of a River, tho' a Countryman went before for our Guide; for the Water &s;welled upon us as we pa&s;&s;ed, and the Stream was very &s;trong, &s;o that we were obliged to turn our Hor&s;es Heads to the Current, and &s;loping over, edg'd near the Shore by Degrees; whereas, if our Hor&s;es had &s;tood directly cro&s;s the Stream, they could not have kept their Feet. The Inhabitants follow Fi&s;hing, as well in the Sea, as in the Ri|vers and Loughs, which lie every-where under the Hills; it which, about <HI>September,</HI> they catch an in|credible Number of excellent Eels; by which they are no le&s;s Gainers, than by their little Hor&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="108">This Part of the Country is very mountainous, and &s;ome of the Hills prodigiou&s;ly high; but they were all covered with Sheep, and other Cattle, the Gentlemen hereabouts being the greate&s;t Sheep-ma&s;ters, (for &s;o they call them&s;elves) and the greate&s;t Breeders of Black Cattle and Hor&s;es, in the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>We now entered the Shire of <HI>Aire,</HI> full North from the Mull, or North-point of <HI>Galloway:</HI> And as we, before, coa&s;ted the South Bay, or Firth of <HI>Sol|way,</HI> which parts <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;o now we coa&s;ted the Firth of <HI>Clyde,</HI> which, for near 60 Miles, lies on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Shore, &s;tanding away North-ea&s;t from the Point of the Mull. This Shire is divided into three great Bailleries; <HI>viz. Car|rick, Kyle,</HI> and <HI>Cunningham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Carrick</HI> is a more fruitful and better cultivated Country than <HI>Galloway,</HI> and not &s;o mountainous; but it does not &s;o much abound in Cattle, e&s;pecially Sheep and Hor&s;es. Tho' there is no con&s;iderable Port in this Part of the Country, yet the People begin to trade here, and tho&s;e who live towards the Coa&s;t are great Fi&s;hermen, and are employed by the Mer|chants of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and other Places, to catch Her|rings for them. <HI>May-bole</HI> is the chief Town; but tho' it &s;tands on the Coa&s;t, it has no Harbour, and is poor and decayed. The Market is pretty good, becau&s;e there are many Gentlemen in the Neigh|bourhood, and the Coa&s;t near it full of People; but the Hou&s;es are mean, low, and very coar&s;e. The Family of <HI>Kennedy,</HI> Earls of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ils,</HI> are or were Lords of great Part of the Country, and have a good an|tient Seat; but we did not go to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>Coming to the North Bounds of <HI>Carrick,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Dun</HI> over a Bridge of one Arch, con|&s;i&s;ting of 90 Feet; which is much larger than the <HI>Rialto</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI> or the middle Arch of the great Bridge at <HI>York.</HI> We found many large ones in this
<PB N="108" REF="109">
Country, tho' I think, none &s;o large as this, except at <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> and <HI>Stirling.</HI> This Bridge led us into the County of <HI>Kyle,</HI> the &s;econd Divi&s;ion of the Shire of <HI>Aire.</HI> Here I ob&s;erved, that, contrary to our Ex|pectation, we found, the farther North we travelled, the Country was the finer, better, and richer.</P>
<P><HI>Kyle</HI> is more populous than <HI>Carrick</HI>; and the Soil being better here, and the Country more plain and level, &s;o on the Banks of the River there are abun|dance of Gentlemens Seats, tho' mo&s;t of them are built Ca&s;tle-wi&s;e, becau&s;e of Enemies. But that Fear being now over, they begin to plant and inclo&s;e after the Manner of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Writers tell us a long Story of a great Battle in this Country between <HI>Coilus,</HI> or <HI>Kylus,</HI> a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> King, and their <HI>Fergus</HI> I. where the former was killed, and from thence the Country took his Name. Many Monuments of this Battle are &s;till to be &s;een here. The Place where were it was fought is called <HI>Coil-field</HI>; a Church near it, is called <HI>Coil-town</HI> Kirk. The River near which it was won, and which falls into the River <HI>Aire,</HI> four Miles above the Town of <HI>Aire,</HI> is called <HI>Coil</HI>; a Lake not far from it, near which the <HI>Scots</HI> encamped, is called <HI>Lake Fergus.</HI> A Trumpet re&s;embling a crooked Horn, which has a very &s;hrill Sound, was digged up in the Field of Battle, and is &s;till kept in the Laird of <HI>Caprington</HI>'s Hou&s;e, called <HI>Coil-field,</HI> and made u&s;e of to call his Servants and Workmen together. Here, or, as &s;ome &s;ay, at <HI>Largis</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Clyde,</HI> was another bloody Battle in the Year 1263. between King <HI>Alexander</HI> III. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Acho,</HI> King of <HI>Norway,</HI> who came to the Port of <HI>Aire</HI> with a great Fleet of Ships, and 20,000 Men, who, after ravaging the Country, was routed, and lo&s;t both his Army, and 140 Ships. At this la&s;t Battle, an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Gentleman, of the Name of <HI>Mackenzie,</HI> behaved &s;o well, that King <HI>Alexander</HI> gave him the
<PB N="109" REF="110">
Lands of <HI>Kintail,</HI> which continued in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Earl of <HI>Seaforth,</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or, till the late Earl taking Part with the Pretender, his E&s;tate became forfeited. From this brave <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> are de&s;cended the numerous Name of <HI>Mackenzie.</HI></P>
<P>Over the River <HI>Aire</HI> is a Bridge of Four Arches, near the new Town; and South of the Bridge &s;tands the old Town of <HI>Aire</HI> or <HI>Erigena,</HI> famous for its Antiquity and Privileges. It has a very large Juri&s;diction of near 64 Miles, reaching from the Mouth of <HI>Clyde</HI> to the Borders of <HI>Galloway.</HI> It &s;tands on a &s;andy Plain, but has plea&s;ant green Fields two Miles South and North of it. In the Fields betwixt the Mouth of the River <HI>Dun</HI> and <HI>Aire,</HI> &s;tands a very beautiful Church. The Town has a very good Harbour in the River, and lies conveniently for Trade: And 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee, that it has been much larger, than it is at pre&s;ent. It is now like an old Beauty, and &s;hews the Ruins of a good Face, but is &s;till decaying every Day; and from having been the fifth be&s;t Town in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as the Town&s;men &s;ay, it is now the fifth wor&s;t; which is owing to the Decay of its Trade: So true it is, that Commerce is the Life of Cities, of Nations, and even of Kingdoms. What was the Rea&s;on of the Decay of Trade in this Place, is not ea&s;y to determine, the People them&s;elves being either unwilling or unable to tell. Here, over the River <HI>Irvin,</HI> which divides <HI>Aire</HI> from <HI>Cunningham,</HI> is a good Bridge of four Arches. <HI>Aire</HI> is noted for the treacherous Murder of many Noblemen and Gentle|men by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Wallace</HI>'s Time; when they were called together during a Truce (after <HI>Edward</HI> I. had over-run the Country) on Pretence of holding a Court of Ju&s;tice, and were treacherou&s;ly hanged one after another, as they entered the King's large Barns, where the Court was held.</P>
<P>This was as &s;everely, as ju&s;tly, revenged by <HI>Wal|lace,</HI> with whom, as Warden of <HI>Scotland,</HI> they had
<PB N="110" REF="111">
made the Truce, and whom they endeavoured to entice thither by their Charter of Peace, as they had done a great many others of Quality. But he, having Notice of what had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;urpri&s;ed them that very Night in their Jollity, rejoicing that they had, as they thought, by the&s;e treacherous Murders, &s;ecured <HI>Scotland</HI> for ever; and having &s;et Guards round the Barn, that none &s;hould e&s;cape, he burnt all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in them. The Ruins of tho&s;e Barns are &s;till &s;hewn here.</P>
<P><HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> built a Citadel at <HI>Aire,</HI> well fortify'd with a Fo&s;&s;e, and a Stone Wall. At the Re&s;toration it was demoli&s;hed; and at pre&s;ent only &s;ome Hou&s;es, and Angles of the Ramparts, are &s;tanding.</P>
<P>Two Miles North of <HI>Aire</HI> Town &s;tands <HI>Kinca&s;e,</HI> which has been, from Time immemorial, a Place of Retirement for Leprous Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>From <HI>Aire,</HI> keeping &s;till North, we came to <HI>Irwin,</HI> upon a River of the &s;ame Name. Here they have a Port, which formerly was in much better Condition than it had been for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, the Harbour being &s;o much decay'd by Length of Time, and other Accidents, that the Trade of the Town began to decay; for the Water not being confined to its proper Chanel, the Harbour became &s;o choaked up with Sand-Banks, that it was of little U&s;e to what it had been; &s;o that Ships of very &s;mall Burden were freqently &s;hut up for &s;everal Months in the River, before they could &s;ail out to Sea. At the &s;ame time the Town-hou&s;e, Church, Streets, and other publick Works, as the common Gaol, and one of the Arches of the Bridge, were all in a ruinous Condition: All which occa&s;ion'd an Act of Parliament to pa&s;s in the Ninth of King <HI>George</HI> II. for laying a Duty of Two-pennies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale or Beer &s;old in the Town of <HI>Irvin,</HI> and its Liberties; and a Duty of a Penny Sterling
<PB N="111" REF="112">
upon every Ton of Coals &s;hipped off for Tran&s;|portation. By which means the Harbour will &s;oon be re&s;tored to its pri&s;tine Goodne&s;s, and the Town to its former flouri&s;hing Condition. But thus much mu&s;t be &s;aid, that notwith&s;tanding the declining Condition of its Harbour, before this Act pa&s;&s;ed, it carried on a greater Trade, than mo&s;t of the Ports between <HI>Aire</HI> and <HI>Dumfries.</HI> Their chief Trade is in <HI>Scots</HI> Coal, which they export in great Quantities to <HI>Ireland</HI>; for the neighbouring Hills abound with this Commodity. <HI>Irvin</HI> is the Capital of that Di|vi&s;ion of the Shire of <HI>Aire,</HI> which they call <HI>Cun|ningham,</HI> and is really within the Firth of <HI>Clyde,</HI> tho' not actually within the River it&s;elf. The Name of <HI>Cunningham</HI> &s;ignifies, <HI>the King's Habitation,</HI> from the Beauty of its Situation.</P>
<P>As it has more Trade than the other Parts I have been &s;peaking of, &s;o it is better built. Here are two hand&s;ome Streets, a good Quay, and a capacious Har|bour. The Country is rich and fruitful, filled with Gentlemens Seats and well-built Hou&s;es; and where|ever you turn your Eye, you &s;ee nothing but beauti|ful Enclo&s;ures, plea&s;ant Pa&s;tures, and Gra&s;s Grounds, &s;o that we thought our&s;elves in <HI>England</HI> again. It is &s;aid, this inclo&s;ing the Ground was owing to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Soldiers, who were placed here and in <HI>Kyle</HI> by <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> (for at <HI>Aire</HI> he built a Citadel, as I have &s;aid); the&s;e prompted and encouraged the People to inclo&s;e and improve their Lands, and in|&s;tructed them in the Manner of Hu&s;bandry practi&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> which they have not forgot to this Day.</P>
<P>A very extraordinary Storm of Thunder and Lightning happened here, on the 26th of <HI>November</HI> 1740. which de&s;erves to be taken notice of, for the Terror it occa&s;ion'd, it being equally uncommon for the Sea&s;on of the Year, and the Climate.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="113">At Noon began to fall a very heavy Rain, which ended in &s;uch a Shower of large Hail, that every body betook them&s;elves to Shelter from its Violence. This was followed with a &s;udden and mo&s;t dread|ful Fla&s;h of Fire, and Crack of Thunder. The Lightning accompanied the Thunder, which did not continue rolling, as u&s;ually, &s;hort and quick; but the Noi&s;e &s;eemed greater and more frightful, than as if all the Ordnance on Earth had been at one In&s;tant di&s;charged. The Whole &s;eemed to break upon the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> and Steeple; drove in much of the Roof on two Sides, &s;o as Waggons might pa&s;s thro'; the Steeple was much &s;hattered, and the Crevices large. The Town-clock was broke to Pieces, the Work either calcin'd or melted. The &s;trong Door of the Pri&s;on was bur&s;t up (notwith&s;tanding its large iron Bars). A Lad of Fourteen was killed as he &s;tood at a Win|dow, and his Cloaths intirely con&s;umed; his Brother, aged Twelve, was thrown down near by him; an|other Brother was &s;truck blind; their Aunt had all her Cloaths burnt to A&s;hes on one Side, and even her Skin flay'd off, wor&s;e than could have been done by any Bli&s;tering-plai&s;ter; her other Side &s;eem'd untouch'd. 'Tis ob&s;ervable, that not one Bone of any of them was broken, tho' every Hair was &s;inged, and that the &s;ulphureous Stench about them was intolerable. Many other Per&s;ons were al&s;o grievou&s;ly hurt. Two Sailors coming from the Quay, &s;aid, that a large Pillar of Fire &s;truck them in the Face, which brought them to their Knees. One Mr. <HI>Cunningham</HI> &s;aid, it appear'd to him as a mo&s;t voluminous Pillar of Fire, proceeding quick as from the Mouth of Cannon; and, that he thought, from the uncommon Smoke over the <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> that it had been all on Fire; he was thrown down, and his Foot much hurt. The People had &s;carce recovered their Sen&s;es, when two other Cracks of Thunder gave fre&s;h Grounds of Terror; &s;o that it was apprehended the
<PB N="113" REF="114">
General Judgment approached, and every one pro|&s;trated them&s;elves in Humility, imploring Mercy from on high; but the&s;e la&s;t, tho' terrible and un|common, were nothing to the fir&s;t. Great hewn Stones were carried violently out of the Steeple to Baillie <HI>Ne&s;bitt</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where they left Impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>A little from <HI>Irvin</HI> &s;tood <HI>Kilmarnock</HI> Ca&s;tle, the Seat of the Family of the <HI>Boyds,</HI> Earls of <HI>Kilmar|nock,</HI> which on the 15th of <HI>March</HI> 1738-9. was intirely con&s;umed, with the Furniture, and a curious Collection of Books in MSS. nothing being &s;aved but the Charter-che&s;t. On the other Side is the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Eglington,</HI> the Seat of the antient Family of the <HI>Montgomeries,</HI> Earls of <HI>Eglington.</HI> On the North-ea&s;t Borders of this County, where it joins to <HI>Clyd&s;dale,</HI> is the Ca&s;tle of <HI>London,</HI> the noble and beautiful Seat of the Earl of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Bay of <HI>Clyde</HI> &s;tands the Town of <HI>Largis,</HI> famous for the Defeat of the <HI>Norwegians</HI> by King <HI>Alexander</HI> III. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which &s;ome give to <HI>Kyle,</HI> as we have &s;aid above.</P>
<P><HI>Kilmaers,</HI> in the &s;ame County, is the Seat of the noble and antient Family of <HI>Cunningham,</HI> Earls of <HI>Glencairn. Camden</HI> &s;ays, that the Family derives its Original from one of that Name concerned in the Murder of <HI>Thomas &agrave; Becket,</HI> who fled into <HI>Scotland</HI> on that Account, and therefore bear an Epi&s;copal Pall in their Arms; but it is plain from their Motto, <HI>Over, Fork, over,</HI> that it is a Fork, and not an Epi|&s;copal Pall: and the Family, no doubt, is of a much higher and nobler Original.</P>
<P>In the Sea lies <HI>Lady I&s;le,</HI> where is great Plenty of Rabbets and Fowl, but no Inhabitants.</P>
<P>With the Divi&s;ion of <HI>Cunningham</HI> I quitted the Shire of <HI>Aire,</HI> which is, without Exception, one of the plea&s;ante&s;t Counties in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Joining to it North, and bordering on the <HI>Clyde</HI> it&s;elf, lies the Shire, or rather Barony of <HI>Renfrew,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="115">
which was the antient E&s;tate of the <HI>Stuarts</HI> before they &s;ucceeded to the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and his Royal Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> among other Titles, is now &s;tyled Baron of <HI>Renfrew.</HI> It is a plea&s;ant, rich, and populous Country; and tho' the Soil is not thought to be &s;o good as in <HI>Cunningham,</HI> yet that is abundantly recompen&s;ed by the Neigh|bourhood of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> and the <HI>Clyde,</HI> and the great Commerce of both.</P>
<P>We kept our Rout from <HI>Irvin</HI> along the Coa&s;t, as near as we could; &s;o that we &s;aw all the Firth of the <HI>Clyde,</HI> and the very Opening it&s;elf, which is ju&s;t at the We&s;t-corner of this County. There are &s;ome Villages and Fi&s;hing Towns within the Mouth of this River which have good Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Town of Note is called <HI>Greenock,</HI> which &s;eems not to be an antient Place, but to be grown up in later Years by being a good Road for Ships to ride in that come into, and go out from <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> as Ships for <HI>London</HI> do in the <HI>Downs.</HI> The Town is well-built, has many rich trading Families in it, and a Ca&s;tle to command the Road. It is the chief Place in the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Herring Fi&s;hing; and the Merchants of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> who are concerned in it, employ their Ve&s;&s;els for catching and curing the Fi&s;h, and for carrying them Abroad to Market afterwards; and their being ready on all Hands to go to Sea, makes them often leave the Care of their own Ships to the <HI>Greenock</HI> Men, who are good Seamen, and excellent Pilots for tho&s;e difficult Seas.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t-end of a Bay on the Firth is a &s;mall Town, called <HI>Gowrock,</HI> where is a noted Road and Harbour lately fitted up.</P>
<P><HI>Pai&s;ley</HI> al&s;o &s;tands in this County on the River <HI>Cart</HI>; and, tho' no Borough, is larger than <HI>Renfrew</HI>; and was formerly noted for its noble Abbey of the Order of <HI>Cluny</HI>; the Monks of which wrote a Chronicle called, <HI>The black Book of Pai&s;ley.</HI> The
<PB N="115" REF="116">
Abbey and Church, with fair Gardens and Orchards, and a little Park for fallow Deer, are all inclo&s;ed with a Stone Wall about a Mile in Circuit: The Water of the River <HI>Whitecart,</HI> upon which <HI>Pai&s;ley</HI> &s;tands, is commended for its Largene&s;s, and the Pearls frequently found thereabouts, and three Miles above. They commonly fi&s;h for them in Summer|time, and meet with them in a Shell-fi&s;h larger than an ordinary Mu&s;cle, at the Bottom of the Water. It lies on the We&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Clyde</HI> over-again&s;t <HI>Gla&s;|gow.</HI> The Remains of the Abbey are &s;till to be &s;een, and the Town bears the Marks of having been fortified. At the We&s;t-end of the Town are the Remains of a large <HI>Roman</HI> Camp and <HI>Praetorium,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be vaulted underneath, becau&s;e the Ground, when trod upon, &s;ounds hollow. Here it was <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> was defeated by her re|bellious Subjects under the Ba&s;tard Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> from whence &s;he took Refuge in <HI>England,</HI> and was there mo&s;t <HI>inho&s;pitably</HI> impri&s;oned for &s;everal Years, and at la&s;t beheaded. In the Lands of <HI>Newyards,</HI> near <HI>Pai&s;ley,</HI> on a high Ground, is a Fountain noted for ebbing and flowing with the Tide.</P>
<P>The Country between <HI>Pai&s;ley</HI> and <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> on the Bank of <HI>Clyde,</HI> I take to be one of the mo&s;t agreeable Places in <HI>Scotland</HI> for its Situation, Ferti|lity, Healthine&s;s, and for the Benefits it receives from the Neighbourhood of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and the Sea.</P>
<P>I am now come to the Bank of <HI>Clyde</HI>; but my Method here, as in <HI>England,</HI> forbids my wandering North, till I have given you a full View of the South. The <HI>Clyde</HI> and the <HI>Forth</HI> may be &s;aid to cro&s;s <HI>Scotland</HI> here, their two Firths not being above 20 Miles di&s;tant from one another, which, if joined, would divide it very near in the Centre.</P>
<P>Nor can I refrain mentioning how ea&s;y a Work it would be to make a Navigation from the <HI>Forth</HI> to the <HI>Clyde,</HI> joining the two Seas, as the King of
<PB N="116" REF="117">
<HI>France</HI> has done in a Place five hundred times more difficult, namely, from <HI>Tholou&s;e</HI> to <HI>Narbonne</HI>; and as the late Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy, Peter,</HI> ju&s;tly &s;urnamed <HI>The Great,</HI> did in &s;everal Places of infinitely greater Difficulty and Expence. What an Advantage in Commerce would this be? It would e&s;tabli&s;h a Trade between <HI>Ireland</HI> and the Merchants in <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and open a Communication between the We&s;t-coa&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Ea&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> even to <HI>London</HI>; nay, &s;everal Ports of <HI>England</HI> on the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea, from <HI>Liverpool</HI> Northward, would all trade with <HI>London</HI> by &s;uch a Canal. It would take up a Volume to lay down the &s;everal Advantages that would imme|diately accrue from &s;uch a Navigation, and in par|ticular in Times of War; but it mu&s;t lie till Po&s;te|rity, by the ri&s;ing Greatne&s;s of their Commerce, &s;hall not only feel the Want of it, but find them|&s;elves inclinable, as well as able, to effect it.</P>
<P><HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> is the Emporium of the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> being, for its Commerce and Riches, the &s;econd in this Northern Part of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> It is a large, &s;tate|ly, and well-built City, &s;tanding on a Plain, in a manner four-&s;quare; and the four principal Streets are the faire&s;t for Breadth, and the fine&s;t built, that I have ever &s;een in one City together. The Hou&s;es are all of Stone, and generally uniform in Height, as well as in Front. The lower Stories for the mo&s;t part &s;tand on va&s;t &s;quare <HI>Dorick</HI> Columns, with Arches which open into the Shops, adding to the Strength, as well as Beauty, of the Building. In a Word, 'tis one of the cleanlie&s;t, mo&s;t beautiful, and be&s;t-built Cities in <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;tands on the Side of a Hill, &s;loping to the Ri|ver; only that Part next the River, for near one-third of the City, is flat, and by this means, ex|po&s;ed to the Water upon any extraordinay Flood: It is &s;ituated upon the Ea&s;t Bank of the <HI>Clyde,</HI> which is not navigable to the Town but by &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els.
<PB N="117" REF="118">
Its Port therefore is <HI>Newport-Gla&s;gow,</HI> which &s;tands near the <HI>Clyde</HI>'s Mouth, and is an Harbour for Ships of the greate&s;t Burden. Here it is on a good Wharf or Quay the Merchants load and unload. Their Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e is al&s;o here, and their Ships are here repaired, laid up, and fitted out either here or at <HI>Greenock,</HI> where Work is well done, and Labour cheap.</P>
<P>The City is join'd to the Suburbs on the We&s;t Bank of the <HI>Clyde</HI> by the noble Bridge I have mentioned.</P>
<P>Where the four principal Streets meet, the Cro&s;|&s;ing makes a very &s;pacious Market-place, as may be ea&s;ily imagined, &s;ince the Streets are &s;o large. As we come down the Hill from the North-gate to this Place, the Tolbooth and Guild-hall make the North-we&s;t Angle, or Right-hand Corner of the Street, which is now rebuilt in a very magnificent Manner. Here the Town-council &s;it, and the Magi&s;trates try &s;uch Cau&s;es as come within their Cognizance, and do all their other publick Bu&s;ine&s;s. So that, as will be ea&s;ily conceived, the Tolbooth &s;tands in the very Centre of the City. It is a noble Structure of hewn Stone, with a very lofty Tower, and melodious hourly Chimes. All the&s;e four principal Streets are adorned with &s;everal publick Buildings.</P>
<P>But the chief Ornament of this City is the Col|lege or Univer&s;ity, a mo&s;t magnificent and &s;tately Fabrick, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal Courts. The Front to the City is of hewn Stone, and excellent Archi|tecture. Its Precincts were lately inlarged by &s;ome Acres of Ground purcha&s;ed for it by publick Money; and it is &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the City by a very high Wall.</P>
<P>It owes its Erection to Archbi&s;hop <HI>Turnbull,</HI> and was legally founded by King <HI>James</HI> II. in 1453. by virtue of a Bull from Pope <HI>Nicolas</HI> V. granting it all the Privileges, Liberties, Honours, Immunities,
<PB N="118" REF="119">
and Exemptions, given by the Apo&s;tolical See to the College of <HI>Bononia,</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> for teaching Uni|ver&s;al Learning. A Rector, a Dean of the Faculty, a Principal or Warden, who was to teach Theology, three Philo&s;ophy-Profe&s;&s;ors, were e&s;tabli&s;hed by the fir&s;t Foundation; and afterwards &s;ome Clergymen taught the Civil and Canon Law there.</P>
<P>In 1577. King <HI>James</HI> VI. e&s;tabli&s;hed a Principal, three Profe&s;&s;ors of Philo&s;ophy, four Bur&s;ars, a Steward to furni&s;h their Table, a Servant for the Principal, a Janitor to look after the Gate, and a Cook.</P>
<P>The Family of <HI>Hamilton</HI> gave &s;ome of the Ground on which the College &s;tands, with an adjacent Field.</P>
<P>Kings, Parliaments, the City of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> &s;everal of the Archbi&s;hops, and many particular Per&s;ons, have been Benefactors to it.</P>
<P>In 1662. the Earl of <HI>Dundonald</HI> gave 1000<HI>l.</HI> Sterling to it, for the Maintenance of poor Scholars. The great <HI>Buchanan,</HI> and the famous <HI>Cameron</HI> had, among other eminent Men, their Education here.</P>
<P>Several fine <HI>Roman</HI> Stones, digged up in the Latter-end of 1740. near <HI>Kirkentilloch,</HI> with very curious In&s;criptions, have been removed to this Uni|ver&s;ity, where before was a good Collection of Pieces of Antiquity, chiefly found near the &s;ame Place.</P>
<P>In the higher Part of the City &s;tands the great Church, formerly Cathedral and Metropolitan, de|dicated to St. <HI>Mungo,</HI> who was Bi&s;hop here about the Year 560. It is a magnificent and &s;tately Edifice, and &s;urpri&s;es the Beholders with its &s;tupendous Big|ne&s;s, and the Workman&s;hip of the Artizan. The &s;everal Rows of Pillars, and the exceeding high Spire which ri&s;es from a &s;quare Tower in the middle of the Cro&s;s, &s;hew a wonderful Piece of Architecture. It is now divided into &s;everal Preaching-places, one above the other.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120">Near the Church &s;tands a ruinous Ca&s;tle, formerly the Re&s;idence of the Archbi&s;hop, who was legal Lord or Superior of the City, which &s;tands on his Ground, and from whom it received its fir&s;t Charter, and many Privileges. It is encompa&s;&s;ed with an ex|ceeding high Wall of hewn Stone, and has a fine Pro&s;pect into the City.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> has &s;o great an Intere&s;t here, and in the Country round, that he is, in a Civil Sen&s;e, Governor of this City, as he is legally of their Univer&s;ity, and much beloved in the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> is a City of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and has the Face of Foreign as well as Dome&s;tick Trade; nay, I may &s;ay, 'tis the only City in <HI>Scotland,</HI> at this Time, that ap|parently increa&s;es in both. The Union has, indeed, an&s;wered its End to them, more than to any other Part of the Kingdom, their Trade being new formed by it; for as the Union opened the Door to the <HI>Scots</HI> into our <HI>American</HI> Colonies, the <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> Merchants pre&s;ently embraced the Opportunity; and tho', at its fir&s;t concerting, the Rabble of this City made a formidable Attempt to prevent it, yet afterwards they knew better, when they found the great Increa&s;e of their Trade by it; for they now &s;end near 50 Sail of Ships every Year to <HI>Virginia, New England,</HI> and other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>But if this City could have a Communication with the Firth of <HI>Forth,</HI> &s;o as to &s;end their Tobacco and Sugar by Water to <HI>Alloway</HI> below <HI>Stirling,</HI> as they might from thence again to <HI>London, Holland, Ham|burgh,</HI> and the <HI>Baltick,</HI> they would very probably in a few Years double their Trade.</P>
<P>The Share they have in the Herring Fi&s;hery is very con&s;iderable; and they cure their Herrings &s;o well, and &s;o much better than they are done in any other Part of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that a <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> Herring is e&s;teemed as good as a <HI>Dutch</HI> one.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="121">I have no room to inlarge upon the Home Trade of this City, which is very con&s;iderable in many Things. I &s;hall therefore touch at &s;ome few Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here are two very hand&s;ome Sugar-baking Hou&s;es, carried on by &s;kilful Per&s;ons, with large Stocks, and to a very great Perfection. Here is likewi&s;e a large Di&s;tillery for di&s;tilling Spirits from the Mela&s;&s;es drawn from Sugars, by which they enjoyed a va&s;t Advantage for a Time, by a re&s;erved Article in the Union, freeing them from <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Duties.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here is a Manufacture of Plaiding, a Stuff cro&s;s|&s;triped with yellow, red, and other Mixtures, for the Plaids or Veils worn by the Women in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Here is a Manufacture of Mu&s;lins, which they make &s;o good and fine, that great Quantities of them are &s;ent into <HI>England,</HI> and to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plantations, where they &s;ell at a good Price. They are generally &s;triped, and are very much u&s;ed for Aprons by the Ladies, and &s;ometimes in Head-cloaths by the meaner Sort of <HI>Engli&s;hwomen.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Here is al&s;o a Linen Manufacture; but as that is in common with all Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which im|prove in it daily, I will not in&s;i&s;t upon it as a Pe|culiar here, tho' they make a very great Quantity of it, and &s;end it to the Plantations as their principal Merchandize: Nor are the <HI>Scots</HI> without a Supply of Goods for &s;orting their Cargoes to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Co|lonies, without &s;ending to <HI>England</HI> for them; and it is nece&s;&s;ary to mention it here, becau&s;e it has been objected by &s;ome, that the <HI>Scots</HI> could not &s;end a &s;ortable Cargo to <HI>America,</HI> without buying from <HI>England</HI>; which, coming thro' many Hands, and by a long Carriage, mu&s;t con&s;equently be &s;o dear, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants can under&s;ell them.</P>
<P>It is very probable indeed, that &s;ome Things can|not be had here &s;o well as from <HI>England,</HI> &s;o as to make out &s;uch a &s;ortable Cargo as the <HI>Virginia</HI> Mer|chants
<PB N="121" REF="122">
in <HI>London</HI> &s;hip off, who&s;e Entries at the Cu|&s;tom-hou&s;e con&s;i&s;t &s;ometimes of two hundred Parti|culars, as Tin, Turnery, Milanery, Uphol&s;tery, Cutlery, and other <HI>Crooked-lane</HI> Wares; in &s;hort, &s;omewhat of every Thing, either for Wearing or Hou&s;e-furniture, building Hou&s;es or Ships.</P>
<P>But tho' the <HI>Scots</HI> cannot do all this, we may reckon up what they can furni&s;h, which they have not only in &s;ufficient Quantities, but &s;ome in greater Perfection than <HI>England</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They have Woollen Manufactures of their own, &s;uch as <HI>Stirling</HI> Serges, <HI>Mu&s;&s;elburgh</HI> Stuffs, <HI>Aberdeen</HI> Stockens, <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Shalloons, Blankets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Trade with <HI>England</HI> being open, they have now all the <HI>Manche&s;ter, Sheffield,</HI> and <HI>Birmingham</HI> Wares, and likewi&s;e the Cloths, Ker&s;eys, Half-thicks, Duffels, Stockens, and coar&s;e Manufactures of the North of <HI>England,</HI> brought as cheap or cheaper to them by Hor&s;e-packs, as they are carried to <HI>London,</HI> it being at a le&s;s Di&s;tance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They have Linens of mo&s;t Kinds, e&s;pecially Diapers and Table-linen, Dama&s;ks, and many other Sorts not known in <HI>England,</HI> and cheaper than there, becau&s;e made at their own Doors.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. What Linens they want from <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Ham|burgh,</HI> they import from thence as cheap as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> can do, and for Mu&s;lins, their own are very acceptable, and cheaper than in <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Gloves they make better and cheaper than in <HI>England</HI>; for they &s;end great Quantities thither.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Another Article, which is very con&s;iderable here, is Servants, which they can tran&s;port in greater Plen|ty, and upon better Terms, than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with|out the &s;candalous Art of Kidnapping, Wheedling, Betraying, and the like; for the poor People offer them&s;elves fa&s;t enough, and think it their Advantage, as it certainly is, to &s;erve out their Times &s;oberly in the foreign Plantations, and then become diligent
<PB N="122" REF="123">
Planters for them&s;elves; which is a much wi&s;er Cour&s;e than to turn Thieves, and then be tran&s;|ported to &s;ave them from the Gallows. This may be given as a Rea&s;on, and, I believe, it is the only one, why &s;o many more of the <HI>Scots</HI> Servants, who go over to <HI>Virginia,</HI> &s;ettle and thrive there, than of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; which is &s;o certainly true, that if it holds on for many Years more, <HI>Virginia</HI> may be rather called a <HI>Scots</HI> than an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantation.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I might mention many other Particulars; but this is &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants are not at a Lo&s;s how to make up &s;ortable Cargoes to &s;end to the Plantations; and that if we can outdo them in &s;ome things, they are able to outdo us in others. If they are under any Di&s;advantages in the Trade I am &s;peaking of, it is that they may not, perhaps, have &s;o ea&s;y a Vend and Con&s;umption for the Goods they bring back, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have at <HI>London, Bri&s;tol,</HI> or <HI>Liverpool</HI>; for which Rea&s;on they have lately &s;et up a Wharf at <HI>Alloway</HI> in the <HI>Forth,</HI> whence they &s;end their Tobacco and Sugars thither by Land-car|riage, and &s;hip them off from thence for <HI>Holland, Hamburgh,</HI> or <HI>London,</HI> as the Market offers; and in|deed they carry on a profitable Trade with <HI>England</HI> in Tobacco, which from the Difference of Duty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they do with no &s;mall Advantage.</P>
<P>Now, tho' the carrying their Tobacco and Sugars &s;everal Miles over Land may be &s;ome Di&s;advantage, yet, if, on the other hand, it be calculated how much &s;ooner the Voyage is made from <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> to the Capes of <HI>Virginia,</HI> than from <HI>London,</HI> the Difference will be made up in the Frieght, and in the Expence of the Ships, e&s;pecially in time of War, when the Chanel is thronged with Privateers, and the Ships wait to go in Fleets for fear of Enemies; for the <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> Ve&s;|&s;els are no &s;ooner out of the Firth of <HI>Clyde,</HI> but they &s;tretch away to the North-we&s;t, are out of the Road of the Privateers immediately, and are often at the
<PB N="123" REF="124">
Capes of <HI>Virginia</HI> before the <HI>London</HI> Ships get clear of the Chanel. Nay, even in times of Peace, there mu&s;t always be allowed, one time with an|other, at lea&s;t fourteen or twenty Days Difference in the Voyage, both going out and coming in, which, taken together, is a Month or &s;ix Weeks in the whole Voyage; and con&s;idering Wear and Tear, Victuals and Wages, this makes a con&s;iderable Difference in the Trade.</P>
<P>One thing &s;till I mu&s;t take notice of, before I quit <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI> I have mentioned, more than once, the Duties laid on Ale and Beer &s;old in divers Towns in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the Benefit and publick Emolument of the &s;aid Towns; but have here to take Notice of the like Duty laid for a different Purpo&s;e, that is to &s;ay, for a Puni&s;hment: The Ca&s;e was this:</P>
<P>When the Malt-Duty was extended for the fir&s;t time to <HI>Scotland,</HI> it occa&s;ioned much murmuring; and particularly <HI>Daniel Campbell,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who lived at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and was Member for that Town, having given his Vote for it in Parliament, the Po|pulace ro&s;e, enter'd his Hou&s;e, de&s;troy'd all his Goods and Furniture, and committed other Acts of Vio|lence and Outrage.</P>
<P>This the Legi&s;lature re&s;enting as a Defiance of lawful Authority, an Act pa&s;&s;ed in the 12th of King <HI>George</HI> I. 1725. to take from the Town of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> the Benefits of an Act before pa&s;&s;ed, for laying a Duty of two Penies <HI>Scots</HI> on every Pint of Ale or Beer brewed for Sale in the &s;aid City and its Privi|leges; and ve&s;ting it for the Remainder of the Term, which was for thirteen Years to come, (<HI>viz.</HI> from 1725. to 1738.) in his Maje&s;ty, to be put under the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Exci&s;e, in order to rai&s;e the Sum of 6080<HI>l.</HI> for &s;atisfying the Damages and Lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> in the &s;aid Riot; but it was provided, that when the &s;aid Sum was paid, the Duty of Two Penies <HI>Scots</HI> was to return, for the

Remainder of the Term, to the Magi&s;trates, for the Purpo&s;es for which they were originally granted. This occa&s;ioned no good Blood, it may be believed, between the City and Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>; but yet, this was not the la&s;t time this City had the Honour to be repre&s;ented in Parliament by the &s;ame Gentleman, as it is joined with the Burghs of <HI>Renfrew, Ruglen,</HI> and <HI>Dunbarton!</HI>&mdash;So placable, and &s;o forgiving, are the generous <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nation! or, at lea&s;t, &s;o little Title has the City of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> in particular to the National Motto of <HI>Scotland!</HI>&mdash;Nor did this good Behaviour of theirs turn out to its Di&s;advantage; for in the 9th of <HI>George</HI> II. a new Act pa&s;&s;ed, continuing the former Act for Twenty-five Years longer, and ex|tending it to the Villages of <HI>Gorbells,</HI> and <HI>Port Gla&s;gow,</HI> both which Places were in the Juri&s;diction of the City, and reaped all their Advantages from its Neighbourhood; the latter e&s;pecially, at which the People of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> had built, and con&s;tantly maintained, a very commodious Harbour, and yet were neither of them in the former Act.</P>
<P>From <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> I went eight Miles Southward to <HI>Hamilton,</HI> a Town plea&s;ant and well-built, the Church of which is the Burying-place of the Noble Family of <HI>Hamilton.</HI> But it is chiefly noted for its fine Palace, the Seat of the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> premier Peer in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and nearly related to the Royal Family of the <HI>Stuarts.</HI> The Hou&s;e at pre|&s;ent is large, tho' Part of the De&s;ign is yet unfini&s;hed. It has a fair Front, with two Wings, and two more are laid out in the Ichnography of the Building, which are not yet begun.</P>
<P>The Front is very magnificent, all of white Free-&s;tone, with regular Ornaments according to the Rules of Art. The Wings are very deep, and when the other two are added, the Sides of the Hou&s;e will be like two large Fronts rather than Wings. The Apartments are very noble, and more fit for

the Court of a Prince, than the Hou&s;e of a Subject. The Pictures, the Furniture, and other Decorations are exqui&s;itely fine, and &s;uitable to the Dignity of the great Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. The late Duche&s;s, marrying a Branch of the Family of <HI>Dowglas,</HI> obliged him to take the Name of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and &s;o continue the E&s;tate in her Name. Her Grace had &s;ix Sons, four of whom were Peers either by Birth or Creation; <HI>viz.</HI> The late Duke, who was killed in a Duel with Lord <HI>Mohun, Anno</HI> 1712. <HI>Charles,</HI> late Earl of <HI>Selkirk,</HI> &s;o created by King <HI>James</HI> VII. <HI>John,</HI> Earl of <HI>Ruglen</HI>; and <HI>George,</HI> late Earl of <HI>Orkney.</HI> The other two were Lord <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> and Lord <HI>Archibald,</HI> late one of the Lords of the Admiralty.</P>
<P>The Situation of the Hou&s;e has all the Advantage imaginable; for it &s;tands in a plain Country, near enough to the Banks of <HI>Clyde</HI> to enjoy the Pro&s;pect of its Stream, and yet far enough from it to be out of the Reach of its Torrents and Floods.</P>
<P>The great Park is about &s;even Miles in Circum|ference, and noted for its fine Oaks and Firs, and the &s;mall River <HI>Aven</HI> runs thro' it. It is walled round with Stone, and well &s;tock'd with Deer. The le&s;&s;er Park is rather a great Inclo&s;ure, than a Park; tho' this, as well as the other, is extremely well planted with Trees. The Gardens are finely de|&s;igned, but I can't &s;ay they are &s;o well fini&s;hed and kept, as tho&s;e at <HI>Drumlanrig.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ruglen</HI> is another Town in this County, which gives Title of Earl to a Branch of the Family of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> as has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o the Town and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Dowglas,</HI> which gives Title and Surname to the Dukes of <HI>Dowglas:</HI> Of which Family more anon.</P>
<P><HI>Crawford Lind&s;ey,</HI> in this County, gives Title al&s;o to the Earl of <HI>Crawford,</HI> who claims Precedency as fir&s;t Earl.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="127">In <HI>Crawford-Moor,</HI> Gold has been found in the Sand of the Brooks after Rain, and that in pretty large Pieces, and they dug up <HI>Lapis Lazuli</HI> there. The Remains of a <HI>Roman</HI> Cau&s;eway are to be &s;een in this County from one End to the other.</P>
<P>We then turned to the Left for <HI>Stirling&s;hire,</HI> and, after pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Clyde,</HI> came to <HI>Kil&s;yth,</HI> a good plain Country Burgh, tolerably well-built, but not large, near which the Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;s</HI> gave a great Overthrow to the Covenanters in the Civil Wars. Here, upon a particular Occa&s;ion, we went to &s;ee the antient Seat of <HI>Calendar,</HI> which &s;eems now in its Decline.

<P>Here we plainly &s;aw the Remains of the antient Work, which they call <HI>Severus</HI>'s Wall, <HI>Adrian</HI>'s Wall, or <HI>Graham</HI>'s Dyke, for it is known by all the&s;e; built by the <HI>Romans</HI> cro&s;s this narrow Part of the Country, and fortified with Redoubts and Stations to defend the South Country from the In|cur&s;ions of the <HI>Picts, Iri&s;h,</HI> and other wild Nations, in the <HI>Highlands.</HI> This Wall reached from <HI>Dunbriton Firth</HI> (&s;o they called the Firth of <HI>Clyde</HI>) to the <HI>Forth,</HI> and was &s;everal times repaired, till the De|&s;truction of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire in <HI>Britain,</HI> with which it peri&s;hed. Yet neither this, while it &s;tood, nor the &s;tronger one at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> called <HI>Severus</HI>'s Wall, could &s;o well pre&s;erve the Country from the Inva&s;ion of <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> but the <HI>Romans</HI> were often obliged to &s;end powerful Succours to the Relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Britons. Camden</HI> thinks, that this Wall was built by <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> who being adopted by <HI>Adrian,</HI> a&s;&s;umed his Name. Be this as it will, 'tis certain, that in all the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tories, it is called <HI>Graham</HI>'s <HI>Dyke.</HI></P>
<P>The Manner of the Wall is be&s;t under&s;tood by Mr. <HI>Pont</HI>'s De&s;cription in Dr. <HI>Gib&s;on</HI>'s (now Lord

Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>) Tran&s;lation of <HI>Camden</HI>'s <HI>Britannia,</HI> p. 959. Fir&s;t, there appears a Ditch of 12 Feet wide before the Wall, towards the Enemies Country; the Wall is 10 Feet thick, but it is not known how high it was at fir&s;t: There is a paved Way at the Foot of the Wall, five Feet broad, Watch-towers within Call of one another, where Centinels kept Watch Day and Night; a Court of Guard to lodge a &s;ufficient Number of Soldiers again&s;t all &s;udden Alarms, and a Void within, for the Soldiers Lodg|ings. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are along the Wall great and noble Forts, &s;trongly intrench'd, and tho' within the Wall, able to receive a whole Army together. The Forts which remained in Mr. <HI>Pont</HI>'s Time, who traced them all, were the&s;e; one at <HI>Langtoun,</HI> a Mile Ea&s;t of <HI>Falkirk</HI>; one ju&s;t at <HI>Rouintree Burn|head</HI>; one at <HI>We&s;ter-Gowden,</HI> about <HI>St. Helen</HI>'s Chapel; one at the <HI>Croykill</HI>; a very great one at the Top of the <HI>Banhill</HI>; one at <HI>Atchindevy</HI>; one at <HI>Kirkintilloch,</HI> or <HI>Kaerpencolloch</HI>; one at <HI>Ea&s;t-Calder</HI>; one at <HI>Hilltoun-Calder</HI>; one at <HI>Balmudy</HI>; one at <HI>Simer&s;tone,</HI> and over <HI>Kilvin</HI> River, and <HI>Care&s;toun</HI>; one at <HI>Atermynie</HI>; one at <HI>Balca&s;tle,</HI> over-again&s;t <HI>Banhil</HI>; one at <HI>Kaellybe,</HI> over-again&s;t <HI>Croy-hill</HI>; one at the <HI>Roch-hill,</HI> over-again&s;t the <HI>We&s;t-wood</HI>; a large one at <HI>Bankyir,</HI> over-again&s;t <HI>Ca&s;tle-Cairy</HI>; one at <HI>Dumba&s;e:</HI> In the Ruins of that at <HI>Bankyir</HI> was found a large Iron Shovel, or &s;ome In&s;trument re&s;embling it, &s;o weighty that it could hardly be lifted by one Man. At the &s;ame Fort al&s;o were di&s;cover'd &s;everal Sepulchres covered with large rough Stones; and at <HI>Dun-Chroe Chyr,</HI> by <HI>Mony-Abroch,</HI> were formerly large Buildings. The Length of the Wall was 36 <HI>Scots</HI> Miles, beginning between <HI>Queen's Ferry</HI> and <HI>Abercorn</HI>; it ranged along We&s;t by the <HI>Grange</HI> and <HI>Kineil,</HI> to <HI>Innereving,</HI> &s;o on to <HI>Falkirk</HI>; from whence it proceeded directly to the Fore&s;t of <HI>Cumernald</HI>; next, it ran to the great Fort at the <HI>Banhill,</HI> where have
<PB N="128" REF="129">
been found &s;everal Stones, &s;ome with Pictures en|graven upon them, and with In&s;criptions. From whence it went to the <HI>Peel</HI> of <HI>Kirkintilloch,</HI> the greate&s;t Fort of all, and &s;o We&s;tward to <HI>Dumbarton,</HI> with a great Ditch upon the North-&s;ide of the Wall all along. It had al&s;o many &s;quare Fortifications in form of <HI>Roman</HI> Camps.</P>
<P>From <HI>Kil&s;yth</HI> we mounted the Hills, black and frightful as they were, to find the Road over the Moors and Mountains to <HI>Sterling</HI>; and being directed by Guides, we came to the River <HI>Carron.</HI> The Chanel of a River appeared, indeed, and looked as if it had been cut out by Art thro' horrid Precipices, to mark out a Cour&s;e for the Water; but yet not a Drop was at that time to be &s;een. Great Stones, &s;quare, and formed as if cut out by Hand, of a pro|digious Size, lay &s;cattered in a confu&s;ed manner in the very Cour&s;e of the River, which, as we were told, the Fury of the Water, at other times, had hurried down from the Mountains. If &s;o, they mu&s;t have been &s;ome Ages upon their Jouney down the Stream; for 'tis not probable, that a Flood often comes with a Force &s;ufficient to move &s;uch Stones as the&s;e, unle&s;s a great Quantity of Ice, as well as Water, comes down upon them together. But in all Probability, they are not not driven down by the Force of the Water at all; but are <HI>Roman</HI> Monu|ments; of which more by-and-by.</P>
<P>Here we pa&s;&s;ed another Bridge of one Arch, not quite &s;o large as that we &s;aw in <HI>Galloway,</HI> but very like it. 'Tis finely built of Free-&s;tone, but the Shores being flat, it ri&s;es &s;o high, that it is not every Head can bear to ride over it. But there was a Nece&s;&s;ity of building it with one Arch only; for no Piers in the middle of the Chanel could have borne the Shock of the great Stones, which &s;ometimes come down this Stream.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="130">From hence, de&s;cending on the North-&s;ide, we had a View of the Firth of <HI>Forth</HI> on our Right, and of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Stirling</HI> on our Left. In going to the latter, we pa&s;&s;ed the Water of <HI>Bannockburn,</HI> fa|mous in the <HI>Scots</HI> Hi&s;tory for the great Battle fought here between King <HI>Robert de Bruce,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army commanded by King <HI>Edward</HI> II. in Per&s;on, in which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were utterly overthrown, and that with &s;o terrible a Slaughter, that tho' it was the greate&s;t Army that ever marched from <HI>England</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> very few e&s;caped, and the King with much ado &s;aved him&s;elf by Flight. How he could &s;ave him&s;elf by a little Boat, (as Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> &s;ays) I can|not under&s;tand, there being no River near, that had any Boats in it, but the <HI>Forth</HI>; and then the King mu&s;t have fled North, whereas, to be &s;ure, he fled to <HI>England</HI> with all the Speed he could. He might, indeed, have made u&s;e of a Boat to pa&s;s the <HI>Tweed,</HI> but that was at lea&s;t 50 Miles from the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>Whether the <HI>Scots</HI> magnify this Victory or not, is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to inquire. 'Tis certain that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army was totally overthrown here; for they lo&s;t 50000 Men, among whom were abundance of their Nobility and Gentry.</P>
<P>This Place is al&s;o remarkable for the execrable Murder of King <HI>James</HI> III. who&s;e young Son was by &s;ome di&s;contented Nobles worked up to this im|pious Deed. But when his Under&s;tanding ripened, he &s;aw the Action in its proper Light, and was &s;o greatly affected by it, that he did Penance for ever after by con&s;tantly wearing an Iron Chain near his Fle&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Sterling</HI> was our next Stage, an antient Town, and an important Pa&s;s, which, together with <HI>Dumbarton,</HI> is the Defence of the Lowlands again&s;t the High|lands; for, as one very knowingly &s;aid, <HI>Dumbarton</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="131">
is the Lock of the Highlands, and <HI>Stirling</HI> Ca&s;tle keeps the Key. The Town is &s;ituated, exactly as <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> on the Ridge of a Hill, &s;loping down on both Sides, and the Street gradually a&s;cending from the Ea&s;t to the Ca&s;tle, which is at the We&s;t-end. It is large and well-built, and tho' it is antient, yet the Buildings are not unlike tho&s;e of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Church is al&s;o a very &s;pacious Building, but not Collegiate. It &s;tands in the upper Part of the Town, towards the End, is of good Architecture, and adorned with a lofty Tower. There was for|merly a Church, or rather a Collegiate Chapel, in the Ca&s;tle, and likewi&s;e a private Chapel, or Oratory, in the Palace, for the Royal Family; but they have been long di&s;u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle is not &s;o very difficult of Acce&s;s as that at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but is e&s;teemed equally &s;trong; for the Works are capable to mount more Cannon, and there is a Battery that commands the Bridge, which is of the utmo&s;t Importance, and &s;eems to have been the main End and Purpo&s;e for which it was built. The Walls, and all the Outworks, are &s;o firm, that they &s;eem in as good Condition, as if they had been lately built.</P>
<P>The Palace and Royal Apartments are very magni|ficent, but are all in Decay, and likely to continue &s;o. This is at pre&s;ent al&s;o the Fate of the Palaces of <HI>Linlithgow, Falkland, Dumfermling,</HI> and all the other Royal Hou&s;es in <HI>Scotland, Holy-rood-hou&s;e</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>In the Park adjoining to the Ca&s;tle were formerly large Gardens. The Figure of the Walks and Gra&s;s-plots is &s;till plainly to be &s;een.</P>
<P>The Park here is large, and walled about, as mo&s;t of the Parks in <HI>Scotland</HI> are; but there is little or no Wood in it. The Earls of <HI>Mar,</HI> of the Name of <HI>Ere&s;kin,</HI> who claims to be Hereditary Keeper of the King's Children, and of this Ca&s;tle, had a Hou&s;e
<PB N="131" REF="132">
at the upper End of the Town, very finely &s;ituated for Pro&s;pect, but not for Security, being too near the Ca&s;tle; for were the Ca&s;tle ever to &s;uffer a clo&s;e Siege, and be vigorou&s;ly defended, it would run a great Ri&s;que of being demoli&s;hed on one Side or other; be&s;ides, this Nearne&s;s to the Ca&s;tle makes the Site more confu&s;ed to the Eye.</P>
<P>From a pretty little Flower-garden upon one of the Ba&s;tions on the North-&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, we had a mo&s;t agreeable Pro&s;pect over the Valley, and of the Meanders, Turnings, or Reaches of the Ri|ver <HI>Forth,</HI> which are extremely beautiful. They are &s;o &s;pacious, and return &s;o near them&s;elves with &s;o regular and exact a Sweep, that, I believe, the like of it is not to be &s;een in <HI>Britain,</HI> and perhaps, not in <HI>Europe,</HI> e&s;pecially in &s;o large a River. The <HI>Seine,</HI> indeed, between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Roan,</HI> fetches a Sweep &s;omething like the&s;e, and &s;ome Miles longer, but then it is but one; whereas here are three double Reaches, which makes &s;ix Returns together, and each of them above three <HI>Scots</HI> Miles in Length: And as the Bows are almo&s;t equal for Breadth, as the Reaches are for Length, it makes the Figure complete. It is an ad|mirable Sight indeed, and continues from a little be|low the great Bridge at <HI>Stirling</HI> to <HI>Alloway,</HI> the Seat of the Earls of <HI>Mar.</HI> The Form of this Winding may be conceived by the Length of the Way; for it is twenty-four Miles from <HI>Stirling</HI> to <HI>Alloway</HI> by Water, and hardly four Miles by Land.</P>
<P>One would think the&s;e large Windings of the Stream would check the Tide very much; but, on the contrary, we found the Tide of Flood make up very &s;trong under <HI>Stirling-bridge,</HI> tho' it does not flow above &s;even or eight Miles farther; for the Stream grows narrow apace, and the rapid Current of all Rivers in this Country checks the Tide, when it comes into narrow Limits: The &s;ame is the Ca&s;e in the <HI>Tyne</HI> at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and the <HI>Tweed</HI> at <HI>Berwick,</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="133">
in both which, tho' the Tide flows as &s;trong in at the Mouth of the&s;e Rivers as in this, yet the Navigation goes not near &s;o far up.</P>
<P>The Bridge of <HI>Stirling</HI> has only four Arches; but they are very large, and the Chanel widens con&s;i|derably below it. At <HI>Alloway</HI> it is above a Mile broad, and deep enough for Ships of any Burden; &s;o that the <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> Merchants are certainly in the right to &s;ettle Warehou&s;es there, and &s;hip off their Goods for the Ea&s;tern Countries.</P>
<P>I was very curious to inquire into the Cour&s;e of this River, as I had been before into that of the <HI>Clyde,</HI> to &s;ee if there was a Po&s;&s;ibility of uniting their Waters for an Inland Navigation; becau&s;e I had ob|&s;erved that the Charts and Plans of the Country brought them almo&s;t to meet. But when I came to &s;urvey the Ground exactly, I found the Map-makers greatly mi&s;taken, and that they had not only given the Situation and Cour&s;es of the Rivers wrong, but the Di&s;tances al&s;o. However, upon the whole, I &s;aw plainly, that notwith&s;tanding &s;everal Circum|&s;tances which might ob&s;truct it, and cau&s;e the Work|men to fetch &s;ome winding Turns out of the Way, yet a Canal of about 18 Miles would fairly join the Rivers, and make a clear Navigation from the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> to the <HI>German</HI> Sea; and that this could be done with|out any con&s;iderable Ob&s;truction; for they would not have Occa&s;ion for above four Sluices in the whole Way, and tho&s;e only to head a Ba&s;on, or Re|ceptacle, to contain a Flu&s;h of Water, to pu&s;h on the Ve&s;&s;els either way, as Occa&s;ion required.</P>
<P>How ea&s;y &s;uch a Work would be, and how ad|vantageous, not to <HI>Scotland</HI> only, but even to <HI>Eng|land</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Thing it&s;elf will explain at fir&s;t Sight. I could enter upon particular De&s;criptions of the Work, and an&s;wer all the Objections rai&s;ed from the great Quantity of Waters in the Winter, and the
<PB N="133" REF="134">
Force and Fury of their Streams; but I have no room for it here.</P>
<P>There is a very con&s;iderable Manufacture at <HI>Stir|ling</HI> for Serges or Shalloons, which they make and dye very well; nor has the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture for Shalloons broke in &s;o much upon them as it was ap|prehended it would. This Manufacture is a great Support to the poor People that are employed in it, who are thereby enabled to live very comfortably.</P>
<P>The Family of <HI>Ere&s;kine</HI> is very con&s;iderable here; for be&s;ides the Earls of <HI>Mar</HI> and <HI>Buchan,</HI> there are &s;everal Gentlemen of Quality of that Name.</P>
<P>We had here a very fine Pro&s;pect both Ea&s;t and We&s;t: Ea&s;tward we could plainly &s;ee the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the Hill, called <HI>Arthur</HI>'s <HI>Seat,</HI> in the Royal Park at <HI>Holy-rood-hou&s;e</HI>; and We&s;tward we could &s;ee <HI>Dumbarton</HI> Ca&s;tle. To the Northward we &s;aw <HI>Dumblane,</HI> and the Field of Battle, called <HI>Sheriffmuir,</HI> between it and <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>But our Bu&s;ine&s;s was not to the North yet; for having a Part of the Border to view, we went from <HI>Stirling</HI> to the South-ea&s;t, over &s;ome of the &s;ame Hills we pa&s;&s;ed at our coming hither, that we might leave nothing behind to oblige us to come this Way again. The Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI> has a &s;mall Hou&s;e here, which the Family call the <HI>Lowland Hou&s;e,</HI> to di&s;tin|gui&s;h it from the many Seats they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in the Highlands. This Seat belonged formerly to the Earls of <HI>Stirling.</HI> The County round it, South of the <HI>Forth,</HI> is called <HI>Stirling&s;hire,</HI> or <HI>Striveling&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stirling</HI> was one of the Boundaries of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire in <HI>Britain,</HI> as appears by the In&s;cription on a Stone below the Ca&s;tle, towards the Bridge, import|ing, That one of the Wings of their Army kept Guard there. On the Right of the Town &s;tood the noble Abbey of <HI>Cambu&s;kenneth.</HI> The River <HI>Carron,</HI> which I mentioned before, is famous for &s;ome <HI>Roman</HI> Monuments, particularly two little Hills,
<PB N="134" REF="135">
called by the Vulgar <HI>Dunipace, i. e.</HI> Hills of Peace, and two Miles lower is a round Edifice of Stone, which, by the De&s;cription, re&s;embles what the <HI>Romans</HI> called the <HI>Temple of Terminus.</HI> But <HI>Buchanan</HI> thinks, they were rather Monuments of &s;ome great Actions performed here.</P>
<P>From <HI>Stirling</HI> we went directly to <HI>Linlithgow,</HI> a large Town, well built, with a &s;tately Town-hou&s;e, but mo&s;t famous for the noble Palace of the Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which is the lea&s;t decayed of all the re&s;t; for King <HI>James</HI> VI. repaired, or rather rebuilt it; and his two Sons Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> and Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> afterwards King of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> had Apartments here, which a Traveller may ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h by the different Coats of Arms, e&s;pecially over tho&s;e called the <HI>Prince's Lodgings.</HI></P>
<P>This Palace &s;tands on a ri&s;ing Ground, which runs into the Lake, in form of an Amphitheatre, and has a De&s;cent re&s;embling Terrace-walks. There are two Towers at each Corner of the Court, with Apartments, and a curious Fountain in the Middle, adorned with &s;everal fine Statues, from whence the Water ri&s;es to a good Height. A noble Park al&s;o belongs to it.</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Michael</HI> makes a Part of this Building, and is a Wing on the Right-hand of the fir&s;t Court, as the proper Offices make the Left. The Inner-court is very large and elegant for the Ta&s;te of the Times. In the Middle of this is the large Fountain I have mentioned, which &s;till &s;hews the Remains of &s;ome good Carving, and other Orna|ments.</P>
<P>Here King <HI>James</HI> V. re&s;tored the Order of the Knights of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> as the Order of Knights of the <HI>Bath</HI> lately was in <HI>England,</HI> and erected a Throne and Stalls for them in St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s Church, making
<PB N="135" REF="136">
it the Chapel of the Order. He was likewi&s;e the fir&s;t who ordered the <HI>Thi&s;tle</HI> to be added to the Badge of the Order, and the Motto, <HI>viz. Nemo me impune lace&s;&s;et,</HI> which is worn about it in the Royal Arms, was of his Invention. This Prince &s;eems to have been very much honoured in the World; for he wore the Badges of three Orders be&s;ides his own; <HI>viz.</HI> That of the <HI>Garter,</HI> conferred upon him by his Uncle, the King of <HI>England</HI>; that of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> by the Emperor, then King of <HI>Spain</HI>; that of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> by the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In his Time the <HI>Green Ribband</HI> was worn by the Knights Companions of this Order; but King <HI>James</HI> VII. changed it to the <HI>Blue,</HI> like that of the Knights of the Garter in <HI>England.</HI> After the Union, Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> the Sovereign of both, to di&s;tingui&s;h them, re&s;tored the Green Ribband, and intended to have called a Chapter of the Order, to bring it once more to its full Lu&s;tre, but was pre|vented by Death.</P>
<P>In this Town the Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> Lord Regent, was murdered with a Mu&s;ket-bullet &s;hot by one <HI>Hamilton.</HI> This Earl was a natural Son of King <HI>James</HI> V. and a&s;piring to the Crown, joined with the Reformers, having fir&s;t got the Revenues of the Convents of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> and <HI>Pittenweem,</HI> whereof he was Abbot, or Prior, &s;ecured to him and his Heirs. His Ambition and Intrigues were the chief Cau&s;e of almo&s;t all the Troubles of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign. But I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to mention him in another Place.</P>
<P>At <HI>Linlithgow</HI> is a great Linen Manufacture, as there is at <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI>; and the Water of the Lake here is e&s;teemed &s;o extraordinary for Bleaching or Whitening of Linen Cloth, that a va&s;t deal of it is brought hither from other Parts of the Country for that Purpo&s;e. This Lake is &s;ituate on the North-&s;ide of the Town, and between it and the Palace

are Terrace-walks, which are &s;o beautiful, that a more delightful Place can &s;carce be &s;een.</P>
<P>In the Year 1722. An Act pa&s;&s;ed for laying Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> on every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale or Beer &s;old in <HI>Linlithgow,</HI> and its Liberties, in order to repair the publick Buildings, which were run to Decay, &s;uch as the Church and Town-hou&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to &s;upply &s;uch Parts of the Town with fre&s;h Water, as want it; to pave and amend the Streets, and al&s;o the Avenues within a Mile round the Town; for di&s;charging the Town-Debts, and other nece&s;&s;ary Purpo&s;es. Great Pro|gre&s;s was made in the&s;e laudable Undertakings by virtue of this Act; but the End being not &s;ufficiently attained, nor likely to be, at the Expiration of the Act, the&s;e Duties were farther continued for 21 Years more, by an Act which pa&s;&s;ed in the Year 1733. which, it is not doubted, will completely an|&s;wer all the propo&s;ed Ends, to the great Advantage of the Town and Country.</P>
<P><HI>Forfichen,</HI> formerly the Re&s;idence of the Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> is two Miles South-we&s;t from <HI>Linlithgow.</HI></P>
<P>Near a Place called <HI>Kips,</HI> South from this Town, is an antient Chapel or Altar of great unpoli&s;hed Stones, leaning &s;o as to &s;upport one another. The Vulgar call them <HI>Arthur's Oven</HI>; but the Learned think them to be a Temple of <HI>Terminus,</HI> built by the <HI>Romans</HI>; and others &s;till there are, who con|jecture them to be a Temple of the <HI>Celts</HI> or <HI>Druids.</HI> Near this Chapel or Altar is a Circle of great Stones, and on two adjacent Hills are the Remains of old Camps, with great Heaps of Stones, and antient Graves, which &s;ome think <HI>Roman</HI> Works.</P>
<P>About four Miles North from <HI>Linlithgow</HI> lies the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Abercorn,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Kebercurnig</HI> of <HI>Bede,</HI> where began the <HI>Roman</HI> Wall, thought to be begun by <HI>Severus.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Linlithgow</HI> we turned to the Right, and following the <HI>Clyde</HI> upwards, from a little above
<PB N="137" REF="138">
<HI>Hamilton,</HI> where we were before, we came into the Shire of <HI>Clyd&s;ale.</HI> This Tract has &s;ome Remains of <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquity; for from <HI>Errick-&s;tone</HI> to <HI>Mauls Mitre,</HI> which borders upon the Shire of <HI>Renfrew,</HI> are evident Foot&s;teps of a <HI>Roman</HI> Cau&s;eway for &s;eve|ral Miles together; and there is a Tradition, that another <HI>Roman</HI> Street went from <HI>Lanark</HI> to the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Camp near <HI>Falkirk.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lanark</HI> is the Capital of this County, but is no extraordinary Town; its Bridge, however, is very remarkable. It was built at a va&s;t Expence by the Inhabitants: But the violent Current of the Water rendering the keeping it in Repair too chargeable for the Town to &s;upport, and making it require fre|quent Reparations, an Act of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Parliament pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>Anno</HI> 1703. impowering them to collect Tolls for Pontage, in order to keep up the &s;ame. This Act was in Force for 19 Years, and there was &s;o much Rea&s;on for it, and the Bridge was of &s;o great U&s;e to the County, that tho' the Duties expired in the Year 1722. yet the Rates were voluntarily paid for many Years; till &s;ome Di&s;putes ari&s;ing with &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h Per&s;ons, who wanted to reap the Fruits of other Peoples Labour for nothing, an Act was pa&s;&s;ed, in the 10th of King <HI>George</HI> II. for enabling the Ma|gi&s;trates to repair and maintain &s;o u&s;eful a Work. This Act is to continue in Force for 31 Years, and is &s;o rea&s;onable, that it ought, and perhaps will be, perpetuated: For the Rates are only 6<HI>d.</HI> Sterling for every Coach or Chariot drawn by four or more Hor&s;es; 2<HI>d.</HI> for every Cart or Wheel-carriage; 1<HI>d.</HI> for every Sledge or Hor&s;e loaded or unloaded; Two-thirds of a Peny for every Ox, Cow, or Bull; One-&s;ixth of a Peny for every Calf, Hog, Sheep or Lamb; and the &s;ame for every Foot Pa&s;&s;enger; who mu&s;t be a wor&s;e Bea&s;t than any I have named, to grudge it for &s;o great a Convenience.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="139">A little below this Town the River <HI>Dowglas</HI> falls into the <HI>Clyde,</HI> and gives the Name of <HI>Dowgla&s;dale</HI> to the Lands near it. In a dull Vale near this River &s;tands a very old Ca&s;tle, which has been the paternal Seat of the great Family of <HI>Dowglas</HI> for above a thou|&s;and Years, for which Rea&s;on it is &s;till kept in Re|pair: But by the frequent Additions to the Building, it is become &s;uch a wild irregular Ma&s;s, that, at a Di&s;tance, it &s;eems rather like a Town than a &s;ingle Fabrick; tho' the Apartments are very noble.</P>
<P>The complete Hi&s;tory of this Family would take up a Volume by it&s;elf, as it actually has in a late Work, where the Heroes of the Name are fully &s;et forth, and all the illu&s;trious Actions they have been concerned in. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that there are no le&s;s than Seven Branches of this Family in the Peerage of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> namely, the Duke of <HI>Dowglas,</HI> who is Chief of the Name, the Duke of <HI>Queen&s;berry</HI> and <HI>Dover,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Morton, Dum|barton,</HI> and <HI>March,</HI> and the Lords <HI>Mordington</HI> and <HI>Forfar,</HI> the latter of whom was unhappily killed at the Fight near <HI>Dumblaine,</HI> again&s;t the Pretender.</P>
<P>The Country abounds with Coals, Peat and Lime|&s;tone; but what turns to the greate&s;t Profit, are the Lead-mines belonging to the Earl of <HI>Hopton</HI>; not far from which (after Rains) the Country People find Pieces of Gold, &s;ome of which are of a con|&s;iderable Bigne&s;s. This is thought to be what <HI>Cam|den</HI> calls <HI>Crawford-Moor,</HI> where <HI>Lapis Lazuli</HI> is daily dug up with little Trouble, as I have &s;aid.</P>
<P>Here we left the la&s;t-mentioned wild Place on the Right, and went We&s;tward into the Shire of <HI>Peebles.</HI> The fir&s;t Town we came to of any Note was <HI>Peebles,</HI> which &s;tands on the Bank of the <HI>Tweed,</HI> and is Capital of the County. The Town is &s;mall, and but very indifferently built or inhabited, yet there are &s;ome good Hou&s;es in it. It was formerly re|markable for three Churches, three Gates, three
<PB N="139" REF="140">
Streets, and three Bridges, of which that over <HI>Tweed</HI> has five Arches.</P>
<P>The Country hereabouts is very hilly; but tho&s;e Hills are covered with Sheep, which are a principal Part of the E&s;tates of the Gentry. A great Quantity of them are &s;ent into <HI>England,</HI> to the great Damage of the Poor, who are thereby deprived of the Ad|vantage of manufacturing their Wool. They u&s;ed formerly to export it to <HI>France</HI>; but by the Act of Union, the Exportation of it was prohibited upon the &s;evere&s;t Penalties; and to make the Gentlemen of the Southern Counties amends for this Lo&s;s, a great Sum of Money was at that time granted them as an Equivalent, as I have mentioned before, to encourage them to &s;et the Poor to work.</P>
<P>This County of <HI>Tweedale</HI> has two remarkable Lakes in it; the one called <HI>We&s;t-water Lake,</HI> abounds &s;o with Eels and other Fi&s;h, about <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> that, during a We&s;t Wind, they come out in &s;uch Shoals into a &s;mall River which runs from the Lake, that, we were told, they are ready to overthrow the People who go in to catch them. The other is <HI>Lochgenen Lake,</HI> upon <HI>Genen-hill,</HI> which falls into <HI>Annandale</HI> from a Precipice of 250 Feet high, that many times Fi&s;hes are killed by the Fall of the Water.</P>
<P>The <HI>Frazers</HI> were Ance&s;tors by Marriage to the Family of <HI>Tweedale</HI>; and of this Name was that great Captain, who contributed &s;o much to the Victory which the <HI>Scots</HI> obtained in one Day over three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Armies at <HI>Ro&s;bin</HI> 1301. during <HI>Wal|lace</HI>'s Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><HI>Merlin</HI> is &s;aid to be buried in the Church-yard of <HI>Drumelzier,</HI> in this County; and according to an old Prophecy, <HI>That the Kingdoms &s;hould be united, when</HI> Tweed <HI>and</HI> Pau&s;el <HI>met at his Grave,</HI> they &s;ay that it happened &s;o by an Inundation, when King <HI>James</HI> VI. came to the Crown of <HI>England, Anno</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="141">
1603. the only time, before or &s;ince, it ever did &s;o.</P>
<P>Some Remains of Antiquity are vi&s;ible in this County. The Place called <HI>Randal</HI>'s <HI>Trench</HI> &s;eems to have been a <HI>Roman</HI> Camp, and a Cau&s;eway leads from it half a Mile together to the Town of <HI>Lyne.</HI></P>
<P>In this County are two very lively Monuments of the Vanity of human Glory. The fir&s;t is the Foun|dation of a prodigious Building (more like a Royal Palace, than the Seat of a private Nobleman) begun by the Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> who&s;e Head was no &s;ooner cut off, than his De&s;ign peri&s;hed; for it has never &s;ince been carried on.</P>
<P>The other is the Palace of <HI>Traquair,</HI> built and fini&s;hed by the late Earl of <HI>Traquair,</HI> for &s;ome Years Lord High Trea&s;urer of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and a Per&s;on in the highe&s;t Po&s;ts both of Honour and Profit in the Kingdom, who yet lo&s;t all by the Fatality of the Times; for growing into univer&s;al Di&s;like by his Conduct under King <HI>Charles</HI> I. he &s;unk into the mo&s;t abject Condition of human Life, even to want Bread, and to take Alms, and died in tho&s;e mi&s;erable Cir|cum&s;tances about a Year before the Re&s;toration. The Hou&s;e is noble, the De&s;ign great, and well fini&s;hed; but the Owner was &s;oon turned out of it by his Enemies, who thought the &s;paring his Life an Act of great Mercy.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI> repre&s;ents this Earl as a very mean-&s;pirited Man, and one that &s;uffered him&s;elf to be made &s;o vile a Tool in other Peoples Mi&s;chiefs, that he fell unpitied. 'Tis very remarkable, that he was de&s;pi&s;ed even by the Party which he had &s;erved, and but too faithfully adhered to.</P>
<P>Here we &s;aw the Ruins of the once famous Abbey of <HI>Melro&s;s,</HI> the Greatne&s;s of which may be a little gue&s;&s;ed at by the va&s;t Extent of its Remains. One may &s;till di&s;tingui&s;h many noble Parts of the Mo|na&s;tery, particularly the great Church or Chapel, as
<PB N="141" REF="142">
large as &s;ome Cathedrals, the Choir of which is vi|&s;ible, and 140 Feet in Length, be&s;ides what may have been pulled down at the Ea&s;t-end; and by the Thickne&s;s of the Foundations there mu&s;t have been a large and &s;trong Tower, or Steeple, in the Centre of the Church. There are likewi&s;e &s;everal Frag|ments of the Hou&s;e it&s;elf; and the Court, and other Buildings are &s;o vi&s;ible, that 'tis ea&s;y to know it was a mo&s;t magnificent Place in its Day.</P>
<P>Following the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Tweed,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed by abundance of antient Seats of Gentlemen, who&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are large in this Country; &s;uch as that of the Family of <HI>Dowglas,</HI> of whom one is called <HI>Dow|glas</HI> of <HI>Cavers,</HI> who is Hereditary Sheriff of the County; and who &s;hews the Standard of the brave Lord <HI>Dowglas,</HI> who was killed at the Battle of <HI>Ot|terburn,</HI> fal&s;ely, as the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ay, called <HI>Cheviot Cha&s;e</HI> (which I have mentioned in <HI>Vol.</HI> III.) ju&s;t as he had gained the Victory; as al&s;o the Mace of Iron he fought with.</P>
<P>The Country, South-ea&s;t from <HI>Tweedale,</HI> is called <HI>Tiviotdale,</HI> or the Shire of <HI>Roxburgh.</HI> In which are &s;ome Foot&s;teps of <HI>Roman</HI> Encampments, and a Military Way runs from <HI>Hounam</HI> to <HI>Tweed,</HI> called <HI>the</HI> Roman <HI>Cau&s;eway,</HI> and vulgarly, <HI>the rugged Cau&s;eway.</HI></P>
<P>The Town and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Roxburgh</HI> are both now demoli&s;hed. They were famous in the Hi&s;tory of both Nations, during their mutual Wars, when the Town was frequently taken and retaken, and in the Siege of which King <HI>James</HI> II. of <HI>Scotland</HI> was killed by the bur&s;ting of a Gun.</P>
<P><HI>Jedburgh</HI> is a Royal Burgh, on the River <HI>Jed.</HI> It was one of tho&s;e Towns that &s;uffered in the Re|bellion in 1715. and being be&s;ide in Debt, and its Revenue &s;mall to an&s;wer its Outgoings; and it being well &s;ituated for manufacturing coar&s;e Wool; but greatly &s;uffering for want of fre&s;h Water; and
<PB N="142" REF="143">
its publick Buildings, Bridges, Streets, and Works, greatly out of Repair; for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, and al&s;o to enable the Inhabitants to erect Workhou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the Manufacture afore&s;aid, an Act pa&s;&s;ed 1720. impo&s;ing a Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every Pint of <HI>Scots</HI> Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be vended within the &s;aid Town and its Liberties; and it now reaps the good Effects of it.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Roxburgh</HI> has a very great E&s;tate. His Grace's Hou&s;e, called <HI>Fleurs,</HI> has been finely embelli&s;hed of late Years, and is a noble Seat; and the Country about it, which was formerly wild and rugged, is now greatly impaired and cultivated, and fine Plantations of Trees and Vi&s;ta's &s;urround the Hou&s;e,</P>
<P>From hence we came to <HI>Kel&s;o,</HI> a hand&s;ome Mar|ket-town upon the Bank of <HI>Tweed,</HI> which, being &s;o near the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Border, and having one of the great Roads from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> lying thro' it, which is a nearer Way by far than by that thro' <HI>Berwick,</HI> is a con&s;iderable Thorough-fare to <HI>England.</HI> They only want a good Bridge over the <HI>Tweed</HI>; for at pre&s;ent they have only a Ferry ju&s;t at the Town, and a good Ford thro' the River a little below it.</P>
<P>The Country about <HI>Kel&s;o</HI> is very plea&s;ant and fruitful on both Sides the <HI>Tweed.</HI> The River here does not part <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Scotland</HI>; but you are upon <HI>Scots</HI> Ground for four Miles, or thereabouts, on the South-&s;ide of the <HI>Tweed</HI>; and the farther We&s;t, the more the <HI>Tweed</HI> lies within the Limits of the Country.</P>
<P>From <HI>Kel&s;o</HI> we went North, where we pa&s;&s;ed thro' <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> a long Valley on both Sides of the little River <HI>Lauder,</HI> from whence the Family of <HI>Maitland,</HI> fir&s;t Earls, then Dukes, and now Earls again, took their Title.</P>
<P>The Country is good here, and fenced with Hills on both Sides. The River <HI>Lauder</HI> runs through it, keeping its Cour&s;e due North.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="144">The Town of <HI>Lauder</HI> is a Royal Burgh, the Seat of the Commi&s;&s;ariot; and very plea&s;antly &s;itu|ated.

<P>We kept the great Road over a high Ridge of Mountains, from whence we had a plain View of <HI>Mid-Lothian.</HI> One of the&s;e Mountains is called <HI>Soutra-hill,</HI> and belongs to a Branch of the Family of <HI>Maitland,</HI> the elder Brother of which Hou&s;e was a Gentleman of great Merit, and rai&s;ed him&s;elf by his per&s;onal Accompli&s;hments to the highe&s;t Po&s;ts in the Army.

<P>I could not pa&s;s this Way to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> without going off a little to the Right, to &s;ee two very fine Seats. One of them is an old Abbey belonging to the Marquis of <HI>Lothian,</HI> of the antient Name of <HI>Ker,</HI> a younger Branch of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> at <HI>Newbottle</HI>; who&s;e Predece&s;&s;or, <HI>Mark Ker,</HI> being Abbot of it, turned Prote&s;tant, and got it &s;ettled on him and his Heirs. 'Tis an old Building, but finely &s;ituated among the mo&s;t agreeable Walks and Rows of Trees, all full grown, and contains one of the be&s;t cho&s;en Collections of Pictures, Statues, and Bu&s;ts, in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I AM now to enter the true and real <HI>Caledonia</HI>; for that Part of the Country on the North of the Firth of <HI>Forth</HI> is alone called by that Name, and was antiently known by no other.</P>
<P>I cro&s;&s;ed the River at <HI>Queensferry,</HI> &s;even Miles We&s;t of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> into the Shire of <HI>Fife</HI>; and as the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Places in this County are on the Sea-&s;ide, or near it, I directed my Journey Ea&s;t along the Coa&s;t. The fir&s;t Place we came to was the Burgh of <HI>Innerkeithin,</HI> an an|tient walled Town, with a &s;pacious Harbour opening from the Ea&s;t into the River, which has been lately

much neglected for want of Trade. The Town however is large, and &s;till populous.</P>
<P>I can't pa&s;s over a tragical Story, which happened in this Town in the Reign of the late Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> The Ma&s;ter of <HI>Burleigh</HI> (&s;o the elde&s;t Son of a Lord or Vi&s;count is called, while the Father is living) fell in Love with a young Woman in his Father's Family, but could not prevail with her either to marry him, or to &s;acrifice her Virtue to him; which being known, &s;he was &s;ent away, and he per&s;uaded to travel. However, before his Departure, he de|clared &s;he &s;hould be his Wife at his Return; and if any one el&s;e &s;hould marry her in his Ab&s;ence, he would murder him. This pa&s;&s;ed without much Notice, and the young Woman was &s;oon after mar|ried to a School-ma&s;ter in this Town.</P>
<P>The Gentleman returned, and under&s;tanding who was her Hu&s;band, went to his Hou&s;e at Noon-day, pull'd out a Pi&s;tol, and &s;hot him dead on the Spot, making his E&s;cape unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P>But a Proclamation being afterwards i&s;&s;ued, with a Reward of 200<HI>l.</HI> for apprehending him, he was at la&s;t taken, and tried at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> by the Lords of the Ju&s;ticiary, and condemned to have his Head cut off. Great Interce&s;&s;ion was made to the Queen for his Pardon, which proving ineffectual, he found means to make his E&s;cape out of the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> di&s;gui&s;ed in his Si&s;ter's Cloaths, the Night before he was to have been executed.</P>
<P>After that, he appeared in the late Rebellion, and was in the Battle of <HI>Dumblane,</HI> or <HI>Sheriffmuir,</HI> but e&s;caped again with his Life, tho' his E&s;tate, which was but &s;mall, was forfeited among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Innerkeithin,</HI> a little within the Land, &s;tands the antient Town of <HI>Dumfermling,</HI> which is now in a very ruinous State. For, 1. Here is a decayed Mona&s;tery, which before the Reformation was very large, but then demoli&s;hed, &s;aving a Part, which
<PB N="148" REF="149">
was turned into a Parochial Church; and even that is now decayed, and with it the Monuments of &s;e|veral Kings and Queens of <HI>Scotland</HI>; particularly, that of <HI>Malcolm</HI> III. who founded the Mona&s;tery.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here is a decayed Court, or Royal Palace, of the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI>; but by whom built, is uncer|tain. Almo&s;t all King <HI>James</HI> the Sixth's Children were born in it, particularly King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and the Prince&s;s <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> afterwards Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI>; and his Queen made this Place her particular Re&s;i|dence, and had it &s;ettled upon her as her Jointure: Here &s;he built her&s;elf an Apartment over the Arch of the great Gate for her particular Retirement, having a Gallery reaching from it to the Royal Lodgings. All is now ruinous.</P>
<P N="3">3. Here is a decayed Town, the natural Con&s;e|quence of the Decay of the Palace. The Treat|ment King <HI>Charles</HI> II. met with here, from the Covenanters, was &s;ufficient to make him take a Di&s;gu&s;t to the Place.</P>
<P>The Church has &s;till a venerable Face, and at a Di|&s;tance &s;eems a mighty Pile, the Building being once va&s;tly large. What is left appears too heavy for the pre&s;ent Dimen&s;ions. The Church it&s;elf is &s;aid to be as long as the Cathedral of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> de&s;igned by the Model of that at <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI>; but I rather think, that at <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> was de&s;igned by the Model of this at <HI>Dumfermling</HI>; for it &s;eems the mo&s;t antient.</P>
<P>The People are poor, but would be poorer, if they had not the Manufacture of Linen for their Support, the Diaper and better Sort of Linen-trade being carried on here, and in the neighbouring Towns, with more Hands than ordinary. The Marquis of <HI>Tweedale</HI> has a great E&s;tate in the&s;e Parts, and is hereditary Chamberlain or Keeper of the Royal Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Rocking Stone, near <HI>Balvaird</HI> in <HI>Fife,</HI> was a remarkable Curio&s;ity. It was broken by <HI>Oliver</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="150">
<HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Soldiers, and then it was di&s;covered, that its Motion was performed by an egg-&s;haped Extube|rance in the Middle of the under Surface of the upper Stone, which was in&s;erted in a Cavity in the Surface of the lower Stone. As the lower Stone was flat, the upper was globular; and not only a ju&s;t Pro|portion in the Motion was calculated from the Weight of the Stone, and the Widene&s;s of the Ca|vity, as well as the oval Figure of the in&s;erted Pro|minence; but the va&s;t Bulk of the upper Stone ab|&s;olutely conceal'd the Mechani&s;m of the Motion; and, the better &s;till to impo&s;e on the Vulgar, there were two or three &s;urrounding flat Stones, tho' that only in the Middle was concerned in the Feat. By this pretended Miracle they condemn'd of Perjury, or acquitted, as their Intere&s;t or Affection led them; and often brought Criminals to confe&s;s what could be no other way extorted from them.</P>
<P>From turning Ea&s;t, we &s;aw many Seats of private Gentlemen, and &s;ome of Noblemen, particularly one belonging to the Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> at <HI>Aberdour</HI>; which fronts the <HI>Firth</HI> to the South, and the Grounds belonging to it reach down to the Shore.</P>
<P>From this Part of the <HI>Firth,</HI> to the Mouth of <HI>Innerkeithin</HI> Harbour, is a very good Road for Ships, the Water being deep, and the Ground good; but the We&s;tern Part, which they call <HI>St. Margaret's Bay,</HI> is a &s;teep Shore and rocky, there being 20 Fathom Water within a Ship's Length of the Rocks. So that if a South-ea&s;t Wind blows hard, it may be dangerous riding in it: But this Wind blows &s;o &s;eldom, that the Ships often venture it.</P>
<P>He that will view the County of <HI>Fife,</HI> which is wedg'd in by the <HI>Forth</HI> and the <HI>Tay,</HI> and &s;hoots out far into the Ea&s;t, mu&s;t, as I &s;aid before, go round the Coa&s;t; and yet there are four or five Places of Note in the Middle of the County, which are &s;u|perior to all the re&s;t, and mu&s;t not be omitted: <HI>Kin|ro&s;s,</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="151"><HI>Le&s;sly, Falkland, Melvil, Balgony,</HI> and <HI>Cow|par</HI>; the la&s;t a Town, the others great Hou&s;es, and one, <HI>viz. Falkland,</HI> a Royal Palace, and once the mo&s;t in Reque&s;t of all the Royal Hou&s;es in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader will be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear of &s;uch Numbers of Palaces; but however mean our Thoughts may be of the <HI>Scots</HI> Court in antient Times, their Kings had more fine Palaces than mo&s;t Princes in <HI>Europe</HI>; for in the Time of King <HI>James</HI> IV. they had all in good Repair and in U&s;e, the &s;everal Royal Palaces of <HI>Holy-rood-hou&s;e,</HI> and the Ca&s;tle at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the Royal Palace in the Ca&s;tle at <HI>Sterling, Linlithgow, Dumfermling, Falkland, Scone,</HI> the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Dumbarton, Blackne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Inverne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides le&s;&s;er Seats and Hunting-hou&s;es, of which King <HI>James</HI> V. had &s;everal; and the &s;everal Palaces of Earl <HI>Morton</HI> and others, which were forfeited into the King's Hands.</P>
<P>The South Coa&s;t of the County of <HI>Fife</HI> abounds with Towns; and the following Thirteen are Royal Burghs, <HI>viz. Innerkeithin, Brunti&s;land, King|born, Kirkaldy, Dy&s;art, Pittenweem, An&s;truther We&s;ter, An&s;truther Ea&s;ter, Kilrinny, Crail, St. An|drews,</HI> all on the Coa&s;t, <HI>Dumfermling</HI> and <HI>Cowpar</HI> in the mid&s;t of the County. And it contains al&s;o the&s;e other Towns of Note; <HI>viz. Toryburn, Aber|dour,</HI> the two <HI>Weemys's, Levin&s;mouth, Ely, St. Monan's,</HI> and <HI>Newburg on the Tay:</HI> And it has in it four Pre&s;byteries; <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Cowpar, St. Andrews, Kirkaldy</HI> and <HI>Dumfermling.</HI></P>
<P>The Shire it&s;elf takes its Name from <HI>Fyfus,</HI> &s;ur|named <HI>Duffus,</HI> to whom it was granted by King <HI>Kenneth</HI> II. for his Valour again&s;t the <HI>Picts,</HI> about the Year 840. His Po&s;terity were fir&s;t called Thanes of <HI>Fife,</HI> and afterwards Earls by <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. about the Year 1057. and endow'd with greater
<PB N="151" REF="152">
Privileges than any other Earls of the Kingdom, be|cau&s;e of their extraordinary Services: A famous Monument of which, was that called <HI>Clan Mac|duff's Cro&s;s,</HI> on the publick Road near <HI>Abernethy,</HI> to which if any within the 9th Degree to the great <HI>Macduff,</HI> who was the chief In&s;trument of &s;ubdu|ing the Tyrant <HI>Macbeth,</HI> &s;hould have recour&s;e in ca&s;e of Man&s;laughter, he was to be pardon'd on paying a &s;mall Number of Cattle. This Monument had an In&s;cription importing tho&s;e Privileges, now worn out, and was in &s;uch antiquated Terms, mixed with Macaronick, or half <HI>Latin</HI> Words, that few Men now living would have been able to make it out.</P>
<P>From this <HI>Macduff</HI> the Families of <HI>Dowglas, Weemys,</HI> and the Clan <HI>Chattau,</HI> are &s;aid to be de|&s;cended. The Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> is hereditary Sheriff of <HI>Fife.</HI></P>
<P>Having &s;een <HI>Aberdour,</HI> I took a Turn, at a Friend's Invitation, to <HI>Le&s;sly</HI>; but by the Way &s;topt at <HI>Kin|ro&s;s,</HI> where we had a View of two Things worth noting. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The famous Lake or Lough, called <HI>Lough Leven,</HI> in an I&s;land of which &s;tands the Ca&s;tle, where Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> commonly known in <HI>England</HI> by the Name of Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> was con|fined by the fir&s;t Reformers, being fir&s;t compelled to quit her Favourite <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and afterwards her Crown; but from which &s;he found means to make her E&s;cape, tho', as it prov'd, <HI>Out of the Frying-pan into the Fire.</HI></P>
<P>The Lough it&s;elf is worth &s;eeing; 'tis very large, being above 10 Miles in Circumference, in &s;ome Places deep, and famous for Fi&s;h. Formerly it had good Salmon, but now chiefly Trouts, Perch, Pikes, and other &s;mall Fry; out of it flows the River <HI>Leven,</HI> which runs from thence to <HI>Le&s;sly.</HI></P>
<P>At the We&s;t-end of the Lake, (the Gardens reaching down to the very Water's Edge) &s;tands the mo&s;t beautiful and regular Piece of Architecture
<PB N="152" REF="153">
(for a private Gentleman's Seat) in all <HI>Scotland</HI>; I mean the Hou&s;e of <HI>Kinro&s;s,</HI> belonging to Sir <HI>John Hope Bruce,</HI> Bart. The Town, which has a very good Market and a Street tolerably well built, lies at a little Di&s;tance from the Hou&s;e, &s;o as not to obtrude upon its Privacy, and yet &s;o as to be ready to wait upon its Call. 'Tis all Beauty; the Stone is white and fine, the Order regular, the Contrivance elegant, the Workman&s;hip exqui&s;ite. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Lines, in|tended for a Compliment on his Friend's Poetry, are here literally true.
<Q><L><HI>Strong</HI> Dorick <HI>Columns form the Ba&s;e,</HI></L>
<L>Corinthian <HI>fills the upper Space;</HI></L>
<L><HI>So all below is</HI> Strength, <HI>and all above is</HI> Grace.</L></Q></P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Bruce,</HI> the Surveyor-General of the Works, the <HI>Wren</HI> of <HI>North Britain,</HI> was the Founder, as well as Architect, of this Hou&s;e. That Gentleman has left many noble Monuments of his admirable Skill and Ta&s;te in tho&s;e Parts; &s;uch as the Palace of <HI>Holy-rood</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; the Hou&s;e of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and this at <HI>Kinro&s;s,</HI> be&s;ides &s;everal others.</P>
<P>The Situation of this Hou&s;e of <HI>Kinro&s;s</HI> would be di&s;liked by &s;ome for its being &s;o very near the Water, in&s;omuch that &s;ometimes, when the Lake is &s;welled by Winter Rains, and melted Snows, it reaches to the very Gardens; but as the Country round is dry, free from &s;tagnated Boggs, and unhealthy Mar&s;hes, this is of very little Inconvenience, if any. Sir <HI>William</HI> planted Numbers of Fir-trees upon the Land round his Hou&s;e, which the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, Sir <HI>John Hope Bruce,</HI> is as careful to improve as his Grandfather was to plant. Po&s;terity will find the Advantage of this Ta&s;te, which, if it &s;preads as it has begun, will in time make <HI>Scotland</HI> a &s;econd <HI>Norway</HI> for Fir; for the Lowlands, as well as the Highlands, will be over&s;pread with Timber.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="154">From <HI>Kinro&s;s</HI> I came to <HI>Le&s;sly,</HI> where I had a full View of the Palace of the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> built in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. by the &s;aid Sir <HI>William Bruce.</HI></P>
<P>Here it was King <HI>James</HI> II. when Duke of <HI>York,</HI> lodged, mo&s;t part of the Time, when he was obliged by his Brother to retire into <HI>Scotland</HI>; and his Apartments are &s;till called the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Lodgings.</P>
<P>The Magnificence of the In&s;ide of this Hou&s;e is unu&s;ually great; but what is very particular, is the long Gallery, which is the full Length of one Side of the Building, and is filled with Paintings, but e&s;pecially (as that is at <HI>Drumlanrig</HI>) of the great Ance&s;tors of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Rothes,</HI> or <HI>Le&s;sly,</HI> at full Lengths, and in their Robes of Office.</P>
<P>The Rooms of State at <HI>Kinro&s;s</HI> are well &s;upply'd with very fine and valuable Pictures, many of which are of Princes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but mo&s;t, if not all the full Lengths in this Gallery of <HI>Rothes,</HI> are of the Family, and the immediate Ance&s;tors, of the pre&s;ent Earl, mo&s;t of them having been Peers, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t Places of Tru&s;t in <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the Year 1320. to 1725. &s;o that you may imagine there may well be enough to furni&s;h a Gallery.</P>
<P>Tho' the Hou&s;e is magnificent, I cannot &s;ay the Situation of it is &s;o advantageous as that of &s;ome other Seats; for it has no excellent Pro&s;pect from the grand Town, tho' it &s;tands on the Banks of the <HI>Leven</HI> ju&s;t where another &s;maller River joins it.</P>
<P>The Park on the South-&s;ide is very beautiful, &s;ix Miles in Circumference, walled round and diver&s;ified with little Woods of Fir-trees, which have Vi&s;tas reaching thro' them up to the Hou&s;e. The Gardens are at the Ea&s;t-end of the Hou&s;e, well de&s;igned and planted, extending to the Angle where the two Rivers meet; &s;o that they are watered on the North and Ea&s;t-&s;ide, and on the South are parted
<PB N="154" REF="155">
with a Wall from the Park, the We&s;t-end of them beginning from the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Le&s;sly</HI> (&s;eated at a &s;mall Di&s;tance We&s;t from the Hou&s;e, or a little North-we&s;t) has a good Market, but is, in no other re&s;pect, con&s;ider|able. The Hou&s;e afore&s;aid is the principal Glory of the Place.</P>
<P>From <HI>Le&s;sly,</HI> we turn'd South to the Coa&s;t, and came to <HI>Brunti&s;land,</HI> &s;ituated in the middle of the North-&s;ide of the River <HI>Forth,</HI> ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to <HI>Leith</HI>; &s;o that we have from hence a fair Pro&s;pect as well of the Road of <HI>Leith,</HI> as of the City and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> Here is a very commodious Harbour, which has no Bar, but enters, as if it had been made by Hand, into the Centre of the Town; &s;o that the Ships lie with their broad Sides to the very Hou&s;es; and it is the common Port of Safety to all Ships that happen to be forced up the Firth by Storms or contrary Winds: And Ships trading on this Coa&s;t frequently winter here. The Water is commonly 18, and at Spring-tides, 26 Feet deep within the Harbour; &s;o that it is capable of receiving and careening the large&s;t Men of War. The Town is adorned al&s;o with a beautiful Church, and has a large Town-hou&s;e and Gaol. But the Harbour having &s;uffered much by Time, and by Storms; and the Church, Town-hou&s;e and Gaol, becoming ruinous, an Act pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Anno</HI> 1719. for laying a Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Beer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;old within the Town and Liberties, for increa&s;ing the Revenues, re&s;toring the Harbour, and repairing the publick Structures above-mentioned.</P>
<P>Here is a Manufacture of Linen, as there is upon all the Coa&s;t of <HI>Fife,</HI> and e&s;pecially for Green-cloth, as it is called, which has been &s;everal Years in great Demand in <HI>England</HI> for Printing or Painting, in the room of Calicoes, which are prohibited there.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="156">Next to <HI>Brunti&s;land,</HI> upon the &s;ame Coa&s;t, is <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> noted for its Thread Manufacture, which the Women chiefly carry on; the Men being gene|rally Seamen upon all this Coa&s;t, as high as the <HI>Queen's-Ferry.</HI></P>
<P>Great Numbers of Porpoi&s;es are &s;een almo&s;t con|&s;tantly in this Firth, which the Men make a Practice of &s;hooting, and then bring on Shore, and boil their Fat into Train Oil, as they do Whales, and &s;everal other great Fi&s;h, which they &s;ometimes meet with thereabout. But the <HI>Firth</HI> affords a much more re|gular Fi&s;hing-trade lower down; of which in its Place.</P>
<P>The Ferry from <HI>Leith</HI> to the Shore of <HI>Fife,</HI> is fixed in <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> which is of con&s;iderable Advantage to it; tho' &s;ometimes the Boats by Stre&s;s of Weather, are driven into <HI>Brunti&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>Ea&s;t of this Town is <HI>Kirkcaldy,</HI> a larger, more populous, and better-built Town than the other, and indeed, than any on this Coa&s;t. It con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of one Street running along the Shore, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, a full Mile, very well built. It has &s;ome con&s;iderable Merchants in it, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Sen&s;e of the Word, be&s;ides others that deal very largely in Corn, exporting great Quantities of it both to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> Others again trade in Linen to <HI>England,</HI> who in Return bring back all needful Supplies of foreign Manufactures.</P>
<P>Here are &s;everal Coal-pits, not only in the Neigh|bourhood, but even clo&s;e to the very Sea, at the We&s;t-end of the Town, and where, one would think, the Tide &s;hould make it impo&s;&s;ible to work them. At the Ea&s;t-end of the Town is a convenient Yard for building and repairing of Ships, and farther on, &s;everal Salt-pans for boiling and making Salt.</P>
<P><HI>Dy&s;ert</HI> boa&s;ts, as I &s;aid, of being a Royal Burgh; but notwith&s;tanding it is a very decaying Corpo|ration; the only Support of it is, that the Lord
<PB N="156" REF="157">
<HI>Dy&s;ert,</HI> the Landlord, has a good Salt-work here, and in the Lands adjoining an excellent Vein of <HI>Scotch</HI> Coal; both which are ea&s;ily put on Ship-board at a &s;mall Wharf adjoining. This, I think, is the whole Trade of the Town, except what ari&s;es from a few Nail-makers and Hard-ware Workers.</P>
<P>I take the Decay of mo&s;t of the&s;e Sea-port Towns, which 'tis evident have made a much better Figure in former Times, to be owing to the removing of the Court and Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> which has been doing ever &s;ince the Junction of the Kingdoms under the &s;ame Prince in <HI>James</HI> I. and VI. and more completely by the Union. Their Sea-port Towns had, before, a Trade; when their Court was magnificent; when their Nobility built fine Hou&s;es, and lived in them. They then exported Goods infinitely more in Value, than what they re|ceived; and therefore the Balance was evidently on their Side; whereas, now, the Union has open'd a Door to all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed many of the <HI>Scots</HI>; has prohibited their Wool going abroad, and yet &s;carcely takes it off at home. If the Cattle are &s;ent to <HI>England,</HI> the Money is too generally &s;pent there likewi&s;e. The Troops rai&s;ed here are in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service, and <HI>Scotland</HI> receives no Premium for the Levies, which &s;he might have done, had they been &s;ent abroad, as the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> and other Nations do at this time.</P>
<P>But the Benefits that will attend its principal Ports on the Repairs of their Harbour, and publick Struc|tures, by the many Acts already pa&s;&s;ed, and every Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament pa&s;&s;ing, by the Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> levied for tho&s;e Purpo&s;es, will in time, very probably, turn the Scale in favour of the Union, and increa&s;e the Trade of this Part of the United Kingdom, as by virtue of that Act it &s;tands on the &s;ame foot of Advan|tage with <HI>England,</HI> and has &s;o many good Ports, to receive Shipping, and carry on a Commerce with
<PB N="157" REF="158">
foreign Parts, as well as Coa&s;twi&s;e to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> Of this the Towns of <HI>Gla&s;gow, Dundee, Dumfries, Irvin, Dunbar, Pittenweem, Montro&s;e, Inverne&s;s, Elgin, Aberbrothock, Brunti&s;land, La|nark, Linlithgow,</HI> &amp;c. will bear Te&s;timony, as I have and &s;hall ob&s;erve in their proper Places. In|deed 'tis pity but <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould find its Account in this re&s;pect, in general; for it mu&s;t be own'd, as I have in part ob&s;erved before, that it has a plentiful Product for Exportation; and were the I&s;&s;ue of that Product returned and con&s;umed at home, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily grow rich and flouri&s;h.</P>

<P>From <HI>England,</HI> Sugar and Tobacco; from <HI>France,</HI> Wine and Brandy; from the Ea&s;t Country, Naval Stores; from <HI>Sweden,</HI> Iron and Copper; from <HI>Nor|way,</HI> Deals and Timber; from <HI>Holland,</HI> Lint and Lin&s;eed.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e put together, if I am rightly informed, do not balance the Lead, Coal, and Salt, which they export every Year: So that the Balance of Trade mu&s;t &s;tand greatly to the Credit of the <HI>Scots</HI> Account, which would be all returned into <HI>Scotland</HI> in <HI>Specie</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="160">
every Year, if there was not a neighbouring Gulph, into which it is all &s;unk. And what a Figure would &s;uch an Advantage of running Ca&s;h be able to make?</P>
<P>I have already touched upon the Advantages, that will probably accrue to <HI>Scotland</HI> by the Method they have fallen upon of augmenting and repairing their Ports and Harbours, by virtue of the Two-penies Tax; and &s;ome will further add, to balance the Di&s;|advantages they lie under from the Union, that it is now e&s;tabli&s;h'd in a la&s;ting Tranquillity; and an End put to tho&s;e Wars that u&s;ed to lay wa&s;te the Borders of both Nations; that this will give En|couragement to the Improvement of the Land, and con&s;equently of rai&s;ing the Value of E&s;tates; that the Taxes are ea&s;y and a&s;certained; that the Charges of defending the Country both Abroad and at Home lie upon <HI>England</HI>; and the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Trade abun|dantly pours in Wealth upon her. And all this is true; but, is it not Pity, for all that, that her own Nobility &s;hould not, like true Patriots, lend a helping Hand to the ri&s;ing Advantage of their own Country, and &s;pend &s;ome of the large Sums they get in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> in erecting Manufactures, employing the Poor, and propagating the Trade at Home, which they may &s;ee plainly has made their united Neighbours of <HI>England</HI> &s;o much exceed them?</P>
<P>But to return to our Travels: We came next to a Village called the <HI>We&s;ter-Wemys,</HI> belonging to the Earl of <HI>Wemys,</HI> who&s;e Hou&s;e &s;tands a little farther Ea&s;t, on the Top of a high Cliff, with its Front looking down upon the Sea. At the We&s;t-end of this Cliff, is a &s;mall Plain, once a Bowling-green, where the late Earl, being Admiral, had &s;ome &s;mall Field-pieces planted to an&s;wer Salutes. Behind the Hou&s;e is a &s;mall and irregular Court-yard, with two Wings of Building, being Offices to the Hou&s;e on one Side, and Stables on the other. Gardens there are none, only a large well-planted Orchard, be|tween
<PB N="160" REF="161">
which and the Hou&s;e, the Road goes on to <HI>Ea&s;ter-Wemys.</HI></P>
<P>From thence you come to another Village, called <HI>Buckhaven,</HI> inhabited by Fi&s;hermen, who are em|ploy'd wholly in catching fre&s;h Fi&s;h every Day in the <HI>Firth,</HI> and carrying them to <HI>Leith</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Markets. The Buildings are but a mi&s;erable Row of Cottages; yet there is &s;carce a poor Man in it; but they are in general &s;o very clowni&s;h, that to <HI>be of the College of</HI> Buckhaven, is become a Proverb.</P>
<P>Here we &s;aw the Shore of the Sea covered with Shrimps, like a thin Snow; and as you rode among them, they would ri&s;e like a kind of Du&s;t, and hop like Gra&s;hoppers, being &s;cared by the Footing of the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The Fi&s;hermen of this Town have a great many Boats of all Sizes, which lie upon the Beach un|rigged, ready to be fitted out every Year for the Herring Sea&s;on, in which they have a very great Share.</P>
<P>Beyond this is the <HI>Ely,</HI> a little Town, but a very &s;afe and good Harbour, firmly built of Stone, almo&s;t like the <HI>Cobb</HI> at <HI>Lime,</HI> tho' not projecting into the Sea &s;o much as that. It &s;tands a little on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Mouth of the <HI>Leven</HI>; the Salmon of which River are e&s;teemed the be&s;t in this Part of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>To this Town the Earl of <HI>Wemys</HI> brings his Coal, which he digs about two Miles off, on the Banks of the River <HI>Leven</HI>; as al&s;o what little Salt he can make. The Coal-works are greatly prejudiced by the breaking in of the Water, notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e Charges they have been at to prevent that Inconvenience.</P>
<P>The People, who work in the Coal Mines in this Country, partly from their Poverty and hard Labour, and partly from the black Hue which they get from the Coal, make &s;uch a frightful Appearance,
<PB N="161" REF="162">
that their own Countryman <HI>Drumond</HI> of <HI>Hawthornden,</HI> in his famous Macaronick Poem, called <HI>Polemo-Mid|dinia,</HI> thus de&s;cribes them:
<Q><L><HI>Coale-hewers</HI> Nigri, <HI>Girnantes more</HI> Divelli.</L></Q></P>
<P>From hence we have &s;everal &s;mall Towns on the Coa&s;t, as <HI>Criel</HI> or <HI>Crail, An&s;truther</HI> or <HI>An&s;ter,</HI> as 'tis u&s;ually called, al&s;o the Port of <HI>Pittenweem</HI>; the&s;e are all Royal Burghs.</P>
<P><HI>Pittenweem</HI> is a Port and Harbour very conve|niently &s;ituated near the Mouth of the <HI>Forth,</HI> in the Shire of <HI>Fife</HI>; and great Quantities of Herring, Cod, and other Fi&s;h, are taken here. But it has had two great Difficulties to encounter with; that is to &s;ay, the low Situation of the Town, clo&s;e on the Harbour, by which means the Inhabitants were at a great and con&s;tant Expence beyond their Abi|lity, to maintain a Pier, and other Works, to de|fend both the Shipping and its People: The other, that the Entrance was very narrow and &s;trait, and &s;everal Rocks lay in the Way of the Shipping, which was a great Hindrance to its Trade and Commerce. But in the Year 1719. an Act pa&s;&s;ed for laying a Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;old within the Town and its Liberties, for remedying the&s;e Inconveniences.</P>
<P>Over-again&s;t this Shore, and in the Mouth of the <HI>Forth,</HI> oppo&s;ite to the I&s;le of the <HI>Ba&s;s,</HI> lies the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> known to Mariners by a Light-hou&s;e upon it. The only con&s;tant Inhabitant is &s;aid to be the Man maintained there by the Government to take care of the Fire in the Light-hou&s;e. It was famous in former Times for barren Women going to St. <HI>Adrian</HI>'s Shrine there.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>French</HI> Fleet lay with &s;ome A&s;&s;urance, with the <HI>Pretender</HI> on board, in 1708. when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Squadron approaching, the Four o'clock Gun gave the Alarm; upon which they immediately
<PB N="162" REF="163">
weighed, got under Sail, and made the be&s;t of their Way, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pur&s;uing in vain.</P>
<P>The Shore of the <HI>Firth</HI> or <HI>Frith</HI> ends here, and the <HI>Ae&s;tuarium</HI> or Mouth opening, the Land of <HI>Fife</HI> falls off to the North, making a Promontory of Land, which the Seamen call <HI>Fifene&s;s,</HI> looking Ea&s;t on the <HI>German</HI> Ocean, after which the Coa&s;t bends away North, and the fir&s;t Town you come to is <HI>St. Andrew</HI>'s, an antient, and once flouri&s;hing City, the Metropolis of all <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Seat of the fir&s;t Univer&s;ity, and before the Revolution an Arch|bi&s;hop's See.</P>
<P>It is remarkable for a fine Situation, &s;urrounded with exten&s;ive Corn-fields abounding in excellent Wheat and Barley, and the plea&s;ant Downs, called the <HI>Links,</HI> lying on the Sea-&s;ide towards the North. The famous Phy&s;ician <HI>Cardan</HI> e&s;teemed it the heal|thie&s;t Town he ever lived in, having Occa&s;ion to experience it &s;ome Months, when he came over from <HI>Italy,</HI> at the Reque&s;t of the Pope, to pre&s;cribe to Archbi&s;hop <HI>John Hamilton,</HI> whom he recovered of a Con&s;umption. And twenty Years before, it had the Approbation of the mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians of the Country, when a Hou&s;e was fitted up here for the Reception of <HI>Magdalen,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Francis</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> who married <HI>James</HI> V. King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in 1537. but that Lady died &s;hortly after her Arrival at <HI>Holy-rood-hou&s;e</HI> in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and never reached <HI>St. Andrews.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of old con&s;i&s;ted of four large Streets lying from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, almo&s;t parallel to one an|other. The Northermo&s;t of the four, called <HI>Swal|low-&s;treet,</HI> tho' formerly the principal, is now totally ruined, not &s;o much as one Hou&s;e remaining. The other three by their Regularity do not &s;eem to have been a fortuitous Concour&s;e of Hou&s;es, as mo&s;t of the other Towns of this Country do; all of them terminating Ea&s;tward at the Cathedral, which look
<PB N="163" REF="164">
upon each other, and &s;eem to lament their decaying Condition. For tho' the Town was heretofore about two Miles in Circumference, there remain now hardly 1000 Hou&s;es; and of tho&s;e near 200 are become ruinous, and not habitable. The Num|ber of Inhabitants &s;till amount to above 4000, but many of them have nothing to do; there being neither Trade nor Manufactures in the Place, tho' at the &s;ame time it has a Harbour, but capable only of &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els. Near the Town is plenty of Free-&s;tone, of which all the Hou&s;es are built.</P>
<P>Before the Reformation, this City was crouded both on account of Trade and Religion, Pilgrims coming hither in great Numbers to vi&s;it the Relicks of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> &s;aid to be brought over by St. <HI>Regu|lus,</HI> about the End of the fourth Century, from <HI>Pa|tras</HI> in <HI>Greece,</HI> where that Apo&s;tle &s;uffered Martyr|dom. Here were three religious Hou&s;es, a <HI>Fran|ci&s;can, Dominican,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> Priory, the la&s;t founded by <HI>Robert,</HI> Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> who died 1139. and was e&s;tabli&s;hed upon &s;ome of the Revenues formerly belonging to the antient <HI>Culdees</HI> of this Place. <HI>James Stewart,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> and Regent of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was, in his younger Days, Prior of it. This Mona&s;tery was more like the magnificent Palace of a Prince, than a Convent of Monks profe&s;&s;ing Poverty, as appears &s;till by its Ruins, and particularly by the Wall that encompa&s;&s;ed it of fine hewn Stone, with many Battlements and Turrets.</P>
<P>Here is now only one Pari&s;h Church, that of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> remaining; but there are two others, which are rather Chapels, one to <HI>St. Salvator's</HI> Col|lege; of which, however, no U&s;e is made, it having no Endowment, and the Provo&s;t of that College being often a Layman, even in a Pre&s;byterian Sen&s;e. The other is the Chapel belonging to <HI>St. Leonard's</HI> College, the Provo&s;t whereof mu&s;t be a Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165">The Church of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> is an antient and &s;tately Edifice built with fine Free-&s;tone in form of a Cro&s;s, and has at the We&s;t-end a hand&s;ome Spire in good Repair. In it is a fine Monument of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Sharpe,</HI> who was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated upon a Moor, as he was coming Home in his Coach: It was erected by the Archbi&s;hop's Son, Sir <HI>William Sharpe,</HI> Bart. who to &s;ecure it from the Fate he feared it might be liable to, mortified 6000 Merks to the City of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> to keep it in con&s;tant Repair; which has had its intended Effect; for the Magi&s;trates are very careful of it, and would be very &s;evere upon any who &s;hould attempt to deface it.</P>
<P>On the North-&s;ide of the Town was the old Ca&s;tle, of which now nothing is remaining but the Walls, built by <HI>Roger,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>St. Andrews,</HI> who died 1202. being the &s;econd Son of <HI>Robert Beaumont,</HI> Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> and Chancellor of <HI>Scotland.</HI> It was re|paired by Cardinal <HI>Bethune,</HI> and Archbp. <HI>Hamilton</HI>; the former of whom procured <HI>George Wi&s;hart</HI> to be burnt here in the Parade, while from his Window he glutted his Eyes with &s;o horrid a Spectacle; but was him&s;elf afterwards a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, 1546. in the &s;ame Place; to revenge who&s;e Death, the Queen Regent permitted it to be attacked by the <HI>French,</HI> from whom it &s;uffered greatly. But at the Reformation it &s;uffered more, and its Ruin has been completed &s;ince the Revolution.</P>
<P>To the Ea&s;t of the Ca&s;tle are the Ruins of the &s;tately Cathedral founded by Bi&s;hop <HI>Arnold,</HI> who died 1163. and fini&s;hed by Bi&s;hop <HI>Lambertoun,</HI> who died 1328. It was in Length from Ea&s;t to We&s;t 370 Feet, and the Cro&s;s from South to North 180; its Breadth 65, and its Heighth 100 Feet; tho' &s;ome draw another kind of Ichnography, and make it &s;even Feet longer, and two broader, than <HI>St. Peter's</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI>; and for the Height, as well as the Beauty of its Pillars, and the Symmetry and Proportion of
<PB N="165" REF="166">
the Whole, it was one of the be&s;t <HI>Gothick</HI> Structures in the World.</P>
<P>It was &s;ometimes called <HI>Kill-ri-mont,</HI> from the Church built by <HI>Hergu&s;t</HI> King of the <HI>Picts</HI> in the fourth Century; but the Name of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> has prevailed for many Ages. The Cathedral was near demoli&s;hed at the Reformation; but was repaired, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by the &s;ucceeding Archbi&s;hops; but &s;ince the Revolution it has been intirely in Ruins, as we now &s;ee it.</P>
<P>Near the Ruins of the Cathedral are &s;till remain|ing the Walls of the mo&s;t antient Chapel of <HI>St. Rule,</HI> with the great &s;quare Spire &s;till very intire. It is in Height 105 Feet, and made of &s;uch large and durable Stones, that tho' it was built &s;o many Ages ago, yet &s;o little has it &s;uffered by the Injuries of the Weather, that a &s;mall Sum would &s;ave it from falling for many Ages to come: And as this is probably one of the mo&s;t antient Monuments of Chri&s;tianity in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> it is Pity it &s;hould go to Ruin for want of a &s;uitable Reparation. This be&s;ides would be the mo&s;t proper Chapel and Chapter-hou&s;e for the noble Knights of the mo&s;t antient Order of the Thi&s;tle, &s;ince under the Patronage of the Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Andrew</HI> (who&s;e Relicks were pre&s;erved at this Place) that Order of Knighthood had its Ri&s;e and Foundation; and by King <HI>James</HI> VII's Letters Patents reviving and re|&s;toring this noble Order, which were dated at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> the 26th of <HI>May</HI> 1687. it appears the Knights of the <HI>Thi&s;tle,</HI> or St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> formerly held their Chapters in the great Church of <HI>St. Andrews</HI>; which being demoli&s;hed, his &s;aid Maje&s;ty ordered them for the future, to be kept at the Chapel Royal of <HI>Holy-rood-hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>This City is famous particularly for its Univer&s;ity, con&s;i&s;ting of three Colleges, founded by <HI>Henry Wardlaw,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>St. Andrews,</HI> in the Year 1412. It obtained very ample Privileges and Immunities
<PB N="166" REF="167">
from Pope <HI>Benedict</HI> XIII. which were afterwards confirmed to them by King <HI>James</HI> I. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by &s;everal other &s;ucceeding Kings. During Epi&s;copacy the Archbi&s;hops were Chancellors of it. The Rector is cho&s;en yearly, and by the Statutes ought to be one of the Principals of the three Colleges here, called <HI>St. Salvator's, St. Leonard's,</HI> and the <HI>New College.</HI></P>
<P><HI>St. Salvator's</HI> College was founded by <HI>James Kennedy,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>St. Andrews, Anno</HI> 1448. who erected the Edifice, furni&s;hed it with co&s;tly Orna|ments, and endowed it with &s;ufficient Revenues for a Doctor, a Batchelor, and Licentiate of Divi|nity, four Profe&s;&s;ors of Philo&s;ophy, and eight poor Scholars. The Earl of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ils</HI> &s;ettled a Maintenance for a Profe&s;&s;or of Philo&s;ophy. It has a good Library founded by Dr. <HI>Sheen.</HI> The Edifice it&s;elf is a mo&s;t &s;tately Pile of fine hewn Stone, has a large vaulted Chapel covered with Free-&s;tone, and over it is a very lofty Spire. The common Hall and Schools are va&s;tly large; and the Cloi&s;ters and private Lodg|ings for Ma&s;ters and Scholars have been very magni|ficent and convenient; but the Fabrick is of late become very much out of Repair, nor is the College Revenue able to &s;upport it.</P>
<P><HI>St. Leonard's</HI> College was founded by <HI>John Hep|burne,</HI> Prior of <HI>St. Andrews,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> V. with Salaries for a Principal or Warden, four Profe&s;&s;ors of Philo&s;ophy, and eight poor Scholars. A Profe&s;&s;or of Philology was added by Sir <HI>John Scot</HI> of <HI>Scots-tarvet,</HI> with a liberal Salary. He al&s;o augmented the Library very con&s;iderably; and Sir <HI>John Wedderburn,</HI> at his Death, left a great Col|lection of Books to it. <HI>Fordun's</HI> MS. of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory is in this Library.</P>
<P>The <HI>New College</HI> was founded by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Bethune,</HI> Uncle to the Cardinal of that Name, with Endowments for a Principal and Profe&s;&s;or of
<PB N="167" REF="168">
Divinity, and &s;ome Students in the &s;ame Faculty; for no Philo&s;ophy is taught in this College.</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t two Colleges, having a better Revenue to &s;upport them, than that of <HI>St. Salvator,</HI> are in much better Repair. In the latter, King <HI>Charles</HI> I. held a Parliament, in a large &s;pacious Room able to &s;eat 400 Per&s;ons in regular Order, and it &s;till retains the Name of the <HI>Parliament Room.</HI></P>
<P>A Profe&s;&s;or of Mathematicks was of late Years added to this Univer&s;ity; as was al&s;o, not long &s;ince, a Profe&s;&s;or of Medicine, with a hand&s;ome Endowment by his Grace <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Chandos</HI>; whom the Univer&s;ity, upon the Death of the Duke of <HI>Athol,</HI> in Gratitude, cho&s;e to be their Chancellor; which Office is during Life; and to that alone, and that of his Vice-Chancellor, belongs the conferring of all Univer&s;ity Degrees.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>James Gregory,</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of Mathematicks in this Univer&s;ity, famous for his Knowledge in that Science, has erected in the College Gardens, a com|modious Ob&s;ervatory, and furni&s;hed it with good Mathematical In&s;truments.</P>
<P>It has produced many learned Men; among others, the famous Lord <HI>Napier,</HI> who invented the Loga|rithms, Sir <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> Sir <HI>Andrew Balfour,</HI> and the great Lawyer Sir <HI>George Mackenzie.</HI></P>
<P>The Harbour here has &s;uffered &s;o much by the Encroachments of the Sea, that I fear it will never be &s;ufficiently repaired. The Pier is founded upon a Rock of Free-&s;tone, in Length about 440 Feet; but this Rock extends it&s;elf into the Sea 500 Feet further, on the Point of which &s;tands a Beacon; and the great Rolling of the Sea, breaking over the Rock, between the Pier-end and this Beacon, makes the Harbour very dangerous. In the Year 1728. it was propo&s;ed to be repaired, and the Pier carried as far as the Beacon, and a Brief was granted for that
<PB N="168" REF="169">
Purpo&s;e. But the Collections were too &s;mall to make any great Advances.</P>
<P>By all we have &s;aid, it will appear, that this antient City, and its Univer&s;ity too, are in a very declining State. The Archbi&s;hop's Seat, and Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Courts kept there, be&s;ide the great Re&s;ort of Pilgrims to the Convents, brought great Bu&s;ine&s;s thither, which being now di&s;u&s;ed, and one new College erected at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and another at <HI>Aber|deen,</HI> contribute much to the Decay of both. The City enjoys &s;till &s;ome Privileges by the original Charter, yet extant, whereby it was incorporated by King <HI>David, Anno</HI> 1153.</P>
<P>From <HI>St. Andrews</HI> we proceeded on to two very agreeable Seats belonging to the pre&s;ent Earl of <HI>Le|ven</HI>; one called <HI>Melvil,</HI> and the other <HI>Balgony. Melvil</HI> is a regular and beautiful Building, after the Model of Sir <HI>William Bruce</HI>'s Hou&s;e at <HI>Kinro&s;s,</HI> de|&s;cribed before. <HI>Balgony</HI> is an antient Seat, formerly belonging to the Family of <HI>Le&s;sly</HI>; and if not built, was inlarged and repaired by General <HI>Alexander Le&s;sly,</HI> noted for his Services in <HI>Germany,</HI> under <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden</HI>; and at la&s;t, again&s;t King <HI>Charles</HI> I.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Leven</HI> runs hard by the Walls of the Hou&s;e, and makes the Situation very plea&s;ant. The Park is large, but not well planted; at lea&s;t, the Trees do not thrive.</P>
<P>From hence we went North to <HI>Cowpar,</HI> the Shire Town, and turned to the North-ea&s;t Part of the Country, to &s;ee the Ruins of the famous Mona&s;tery of <HI>Balmerinoch,</HI> of which Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> takes Notice; but we &s;aw nothing worth our Ob&s;ervation, the very Ruins being almo&s;t eaten up by Time. The Mona|&s;tery was founded by Queen <HI>Ermengred,</HI> Wife of King <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Hence we came to the Bank of another <HI>Firth,</HI> called the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Tay,</HI> which opening to a large
<PB N="169" REF="170">
Breadth at its Entrance, as the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> does, draws in afterwards, as that does at the <HI>Queen's-ferry,</HI> and makes a Ferry over at the Breadth of two Miles to the Town of <HI>Dundee</HI>; and then the <HI>Firth</HI> widening again ju&s;t as that of the <HI>Forth</HI> does al&s;o, continues its Breadth from four to &s;ix Miles, till it comes almo&s;t to <HI>Perth,</HI> as the other does to <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>This River <HI>Tay</HI> is, without Exception, the large&s;t River in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' not of the longe&s;t Cour&s;e; for it ri&s;es out of the Mountains, near the Edge of <HI>Argyll&s;hire</HI>; and running fir&s;t North into the Di&s;trict of <HI>Braidalbin,</HI> there receiving many other Rivers, &s;preads it&s;elf into a large Lake, called <HI>Lough Tay,</HI> extending near 40 Miles in Length, and traver&s;ing the very Heart of <HI>Scotland,</HI> comes into the Sea near this Place: Now, as I de&s;ign to keep in this Part of my Work to the Ea&s;t Coa&s;t of the Country, I mu&s;t for the pre&s;ent quit the <HI>Tay,</HI> keeping a little on the hither Side of it, and go back to that Part of the Country which lies to the South, and Ea&s;t of <HI>Dum|barton</HI> or <HI>Lenox&s;hire</HI>; &s;o drawing an imaginary Line from <HI>Sterling-bridge,</HI> due North, thro' the Heart of the Country, to <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> which I take to lie almo&s;t due North and South.</P>
<P>In this Cour&s;e I moved from the Ferry mentioned above, to <HI>Perth,</HI> lying upon the &s;ame <HI>Tay,</HI> but on the hither Bank. It was formerly called <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> or <HI>St. John's Town,</HI> from an old Church, dedicated to the Evangeli&s;t St. <HI>John,</HI> which is &s;till remaining, and &s;o big as to make two Parochial Churches, and can &s;erve the whole Town for their publick Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P><HI>Perth</HI> is the &s;econd Town of <HI>Scotland</HI> for Dignity. Near it &s;tood antiently the Town of <HI>Berth,</HI> which being overflowed by an Inundation of the <HI>Tay,</HI> oc|ca&s;ioned the building of this, where it now &s;tands.</P>
<P>The chief Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Town at pre&s;ent is the Linen Manufacture; which is &s;o con&s;iderable here, that all the neighbouring Country is employed in it,
<PB N="170" REF="171">
and it is the Wealth of the whole Place. The <HI>Tay</HI> is navigable up to the Town for Ships of good Burden; and they &s;hip off here va&s;t Quantities of Linen, for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Salmon taken here, and all over the <HI>Tay,</HI> are extremely good, and the Quantity prodigious. They carry them to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and to all the Towns where they have no Salmon, and barrel up great Quantities for Exportation: The Merchants of this Town have al&s;o a con&s;iderable Trade to the <HI>Baltick</HI> and <HI>Norway.</HI></P>
<P>This Town was for &s;ome time the Seat of the late Rebellion; but by a peculiar Felicity the Town&s;men got &s;o much Money by both Parties, that they have ever &s;ince been enriched by it, as appears not only from particular Families, but from the publick and private Buildings which they have rai&s;ed &s;ince that time; particularly a new <HI>Tolbooth</HI> or <HI>Town-hall.</HI></P>
<P>It will &s;eem a little &s;trange to us in the South, that any Place &s;hould be enriched by a Rebellion; but a few Words will explain it. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Pretender</HI> and his Troops having their Quarters hereabouts a con&s;iderable time, occa&s;ioned a great Con&s;umption of Victuals and Drink, which are &s;o plentiful in the&s;e Parts, that 'tis frequent for Towns to petition the Government to have Regi|ments of Soldiers quarter'd upon them; tho' in <HI>Eng|land</HI> nothing gives greater Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Again, as the <HI>Pretender</HI> was here and at <HI>Scone,</HI> it occa&s;ioned a great Confluence of Per&s;ons of Note, who gathered about him, waiting the I&s;&s;ue of his Fortunes, till they found the Storm gathering from the South, and no probable Means to re&s;i&s;t it, and then they &s;hifted off as they could.</P>
<P>While they re&s;ided here, Lodgings in the Town lett at &s;uch a Rate, as was never known before; Provi&s;ions were dear, Trade bri&s;k; and had it la&s;ted two or three Months longer, it would have made all the Towns rich in the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="172">When this Cloud was di&s;per&s;ed, the Victors enter'd; new Officers &s;ucceeded the routed Party. Still the Head Quarters were here; and afterwards the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops continued here mo&s;t Part of the Winter. All this while the Money flowed in, and the Town made their Market on both Sides; they were Gainers even by War and Foreigners!</P>
<P>The Linen Trade, which we have mentioned before, has mightily increa&s;ed &s;ince the Act of Par|liament in <HI>England,</HI> for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the U&s;e of printed Calicoes; in the room of which <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Linens have been bought and printed in <HI>England:</HI> So that the Wor&s;ted and Silk Weavers in <HI>London</HI> &s;eem to have had very little Benefit by the Act.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ardock</HI> in <HI>Perth&s;hire</HI> are the Remains of a <HI>Roman</HI> Camp; and near <HI>Perth</HI> is a <HI>Roman</HI> Way, where &s;everal Medals, &s;epulchral Urns, and other Monuments of Antiquity, have been found.</P>
<P>From <HI>Perth,</HI> I went South to that Part which they call <HI>Clackmanan,</HI> lying We&s;t from <HI>Dumfermling,</HI> and extending it&s;elf towards <HI>Sterling</HI> and <HI>Dumblain,</HI> none of which Part I had gone over before.</P>
<P>North-ea&s;tward from <HI>Perth</HI> to <HI>Brechen</HI> lies a Vale which they call <HI>Strathmore,</HI> e&s;teemed the mo&s;t fruit|ful in Corn of all that Part of the Country: Here are a great many Gentlemens Seats, tho' on the North-&s;ide of the <HI>Tay,</HI> particularly the noble Palace of <HI>Glames,</HI> the Hereditary Seat of the Family of <HI>Lyon,</HI> Earls of <HI>Strathmore.</HI> The Heir in Rever&s;ion now enjoys the Title and E&s;tate, tho' it very nar|rowly e&s;caped being forfeited; for the elder Brother entertained here the <HI>Pretender</HI> very magnificently, making up for him and his Retinue four&s;core and eight Beds, and afterwards e&s;pou&s;ed his Cau&s;e &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly, that he lo&s;t his Life in his Service, at the Battle of <HI>Sheriff-muir.</HI> The E&s;tate, being en|tailed, de&s;cended to the &s;econd Son, or younger Brother, who is now Earl of <HI>Strathmore.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="173">It is one of the fine&s;t old-built Palaces in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by far the large&s;t. When you &s;ee it at a Di&s;tance, it is &s;o full of Turrets and lofty Buildings, Spires and Towers, &s;ome plain, others &s;hining with gilded Tops, that it looks not like a Town, but a City; and the Appearances &s;een thro' the long Vi&s;ta's of the Park are &s;o different, that you would not think it the &s;ame Hou&s;e any two Ways together.</P>
<P>The great Avenue is a full half Mile, planted on either Side with &s;everal Rows of Trees. When you come to the outer Gate, you are &s;urpri&s;ed with the Beauty and Variety of the Statues and Bu&s;ts, &s;ome of Stone, &s;ome of Bra&s;s, &s;ome gilded, &s;ome plain. The Statues in Bra&s;s are four, one of King <HI>James</HI> VI. one of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. booted and &s;purred, as if going to take Hor&s;e at the Head of his Army; one of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. habited like that in the <HI>Royal Exchange, London</HI>; and one of King <HI>James</HI> VII. after the Pattern of that which is at <HI>Whitehall.</HI></P>
<P>From hence I came away South-we&s;t, and cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Tay</HI> below <HI>Perth,</HI> but above <HI>Dundee,</HI> came at la&s;t to <HI>Dumblain,</HI> a Town plea&s;antly &s;ituated, on the Banks of the River <HI>Allan</HI>; but without any &s;ort of Trade. It contains the Ruins of a Church of ex|cellent Workman&s;hip; but within our own Memory it was made famous by the Battle fought between the Army of King <HI>George</HI> I. under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Argyll,</HI> and the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Forces under the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> on <HI>Sheriff-muir,</HI> between this Place and <HI>Sterling.</HI> We took a full View of the Field of Battle, and could not but reflect with Surprize, that a Rabble of <HI>Highlanders</HI> appearing in Rebellion, armed in Ha&s;te, and headed by a Per&s;on of no Ex|perience in War, &s;hould come &s;o near to the over|throwing an Army of regular di&s;ciplined Troops, and led on by experienced Officers, and &s;o great a General.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174">From hence I proceeded on in Sight of <HI>Sterling-bridge</HI>; but leaving it on the Right-hand, turned away Ea&s;t to <HI>Alloway,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> had a noble Seat, and where the Navigation of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth</HI> begins. This is, as I hinted before, within four Miles of <HI>Sterling</HI> by Land, and &s;carcely within 24 by Water, occa&s;ioned by tho&s;e uncommon Me|anders and Reaches in the River, which gives &s;o beautiful a Pro&s;pect from the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>This fine Seat was formerly called the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Alloway,</HI> but is now &s;o completely modernized, that no Appearance of a Ca&s;tle remains.</P>
<P>The Gardens of <HI>Alloway</HI> Hou&s;e are by much the fine&s;t in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and not out-done by any in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of above 40 Acres of Ground; and the adjoining Wood, which is adapted to the Hou&s;e in Avenues and Vi&s;tas, above three times as much.</P>
<P>Here is a Harbour where Ships of Burden &s;afely ride. The <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> Merchants have erected Ware-hou&s;es, to which they bring their Tobacco and Sugars by Land, and then &s;hip them for <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Ham|burgh,</HI> or the <HI>Baltick,</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> as they find the Market.</P>
<P>The High-&s;treet of <HI>Alloway</HI> reaches down to this Harbour, and is a very &s;pacious, well-built Street, with Rows of Trees finely planted all the Way. Here are &s;everal Te&s;timonies of the Goodne&s;s of their Trade, as particularly a large Deal-yard, or Place for laying up all Sorts of <HI>Norway</HI> Goods, which &s;hews that they have a Commerce thither. They have large Ware-hou&s;es of naval Stores; &s;uch as Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax, two &s;awing Mills for cutting or &s;litting of Deals; and a Rope-walk, for making all Sorts of Ropes and Cables for rigging and fitting Ships; with &s;everal other Things, which con|vinces us they are no Strangers to other Trades, as well by Sea as Land.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="175">Ea&s;t from <HI>Alloway,</HI> is a &s;mall County, called <HI>Clackmannan&s;hire,</HI> from the Head Burgh, and is Part of <HI>Fife.</HI> The Country is plain, the Soil fertile; mo&s;t of it proper for Pa&s;ture; and what lies below the <HI>Orchil-hills,</HI> producing Corn very well. But the Shire is chiefly known for yielding the be&s;t of Coal, and the greate&s;t Quantity of it, of any Country of <HI>Scotland</HI>; &s;o that it is carried, not only to <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> but al&s;o to <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> But while the Freight from <HI>Scotland</HI> is &s;o dear, and the Tax in <HI>England</HI> &s;o heavy, the Price of the&s;e Coals mu&s;t always be &s;o high at <HI>London,</HI> as will not fail to re&s;train the Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>On this Shore of the <HI>Firth,</HI> farther down, &s;tands the neat and agreeable Town of <HI>Culro&s;s,</HI> lying in Length by the Water-&s;ide, like <HI>Kirkaldy,</HI> being likewi&s;e a Trading Town, as Trade mu&s;t be under|&s;tood in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Here is a pretty Market, a plen|tiful Country behind it, and the navigable <HI>Firth</HI> before it. The Coal, the Linen Manufacture, and Plenty of Corn, will always keep &s;omething of Trade alive upon the whole Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Here is a very noble Seat belonging to the <HI>Bruces,</HI> Earls of <HI>Kincairn,</HI> and is well worth a Traveller's Notice; and indeed the&s;e In&s;tances of Magnificence are &s;o frequent in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that were we to dwell upon each of them, &s;uch of our Readers as know nothing of <HI>Scotland</HI> would be apt to think we were too partial in its Favour. But it is certain, that no Gentry or Nobility in the World exceeded the <HI>Scots,</HI> while an independent Kingdom, in noble Hou&s;es, and all manner of Magnificence; as their Families for Antiquity of De&s;cent hardly have any Equals in any one Country on Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Culro&s;s</HI> is a Royal Burgh in the Shire of <HI>Perth,</HI> but in the Confines of <HI>Fife,</HI> famous for a Branch of the Iron Manufacture in making Girdles, <HI>i. e.</HI> broad round Plates, on which they bake their oaten Cakes.

They told me of Mines of Copper, and of Lead, lately di&s;covered in <HI>Fife,</HI> and of Silver al&s;o: But I could not learn that any of them were actually wrought. It is, however, not improbable, but that there are &s;uch Mines; and particularly the two <HI>Lo|mons,</HI> which are remarkable Mountains in this Shire, &s;eem to promi&s;e Metal in their Bowels, if they were thoroughly &s;earched. They ri&s;e up like two Sugar-loaves in the Middle of a plain Country, not far from <HI>Falkland,</HI> and give a View of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> South, and the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Tay</HI> North, and are &s;een from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> very plain.</P>
<P>Having made this little Excur&s;ion to the South from <HI>Perth,</HI> you may &s;uppo&s;e me now returned Northward again; and we proceeded to <HI>Scone,</HI> that antient Seat of Royal Ceremony, where almo&s;t all the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> were crowned, &s;ince the Con|que&s;t of the <HI>Picts.</HI></P>
<P>The celebrated Wooden Chair, with the Stone in it, was brought away from hence, as is well known, by the victorious King <HI>Edward</HI> I. and placed in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> where it now is; but the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Royal Blood &s;ucceeding to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown, in the Per&s;on of King <HI>James</HI> I. of <HI>England,</HI> and VI. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> verify'd the following prophetick Di&s;tich, tho' at the Time, it was accounted no &s;mall Lo&s;s and Di&s;grace to the Kingdom. The Lines were the&s;e:
<Q><L><HI>Ni fallat Fatum, Scoti quocunque locatum</HI></L>
<L><HI>Invenient Lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem.</HI></L></Q>
Thus tran&s;lated by the <HI>Scots:</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Unle&s;s old Prophets fail, and Wizards Wit decay,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where-e'er this Stone is found, the</HI> Scots <HI>&s;hall reign for ay.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>It is &s;aid to have been fir&s;t dignified by K. <HI>Kenneth,</HI> who having fought a bloody Battle here with the <HI>Picts,</HI> in which he gave them a great Overthrow, &s;at down to re&s;t him upon this Stone, after he had
<PB N="176" REF="177">
been tired with the Slaughter of the Enemy; upon which his Nobles came round him to congratulate his Succe&s;s; and in Honour to his Valour, crowned him with a Garland of Victory; from whence he dedicated the Stone to the Coronation of all the future Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> hoping from this Omen, that they &s;hould, like him, be victorious over all their Enemies.</P>
<P>But the better Sort of <HI>Scots</HI> Hi&s;torians &s;ay, their Kings brought it from <HI>Ireland</HI> into <HI>I-Colm-Kill</HI> in the I&s;les, and from thence to <HI>Scone</HI> or <HI>Scoon,</HI> when they had &s;ubdued the <HI>Picts.</HI></P>
<P>The Palace of <HI>Scoon,</HI> tho' antient, is not &s;o much decay'd as tho&s;e I have already &s;poken of; and the <HI>Pretender</HI> found it very well in Repair for his U&s;e. Here he lived and kept his Court, in all the State and Appearance of a Sovereign; but it was a &s;hort-lived Splendor; for in 20 Days he was obliged to quit the Kingdom, by the Advance of the Royal Army. In this Palace is the longe&s;t Gallery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Ceiling painted, but the Painting very old.</P>
<P>The Building is large, the Front being above 200 Feet; it has two extraordinary fine &s;quare Courts, be&s;ides others, which contain the Offices, Out|hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Royal Apartments are &s;pacious and large; but the whole Building is intirely after the antient Manner.</P>
<P>From <HI>Scoon</HI> to <HI>Dunkeld</HI> is &s;o little a Way, that we could not help vi&s;iting it, being the Place where a Skirmi&s;h was fought between the Forces of King <HI>William,</HI> after the Revolution, and &s;ome of the Vi&s;count of <HI>Dundee</HI>'s Men, who pur&s;ued the King's Forces, as they were obliged to retire from <HI>Gilli|cranky,</HI> after Lord <HI>Dundee</HI> him&s;elf had been killed there.

<P><PB N="177" REF="178">Here was formerly a beautiful and magnificent Cathedral Church, dedicated to St. <HI>Columba,</HI> the Seat of a Bi&s;hop, who&s;e Chapter or Prebendaries were <HI>Culdees,</HI> or <HI>Black Monks</HI>; but they are now di&s;&s;olved, and mo&s;t Part of the Church in Ruins.</P>

<P>Upon the River <HI>Tay</HI> al&s;o lies <HI>Errol,</HI> the Seat of the Earl of that Name, chief of the antient Family of <HI>Hay,</HI> who derive their Origin from a famous Pea|&s;ant, who in the Reign of <HI>Kenneth</HI> III. being at Plough with his two Sons, and perceiving the <HI>Scots</HI> fleeing before the <HI>Danes,</HI> he and his two Sons &s;topt their Flight, renew'd the Battle, and gained the Victory; for which they had the Lands of <HI>Errol</HI> be&s;towed upon them; and the Family Arms is three bloody Shields, &s;upported by two naked Men with Yokes, in Remembrance of this famous Victory; the Father and two Sons having no other Weapons when they put them&s;elves at the Head of the flying <HI>Scots,</HI> but the Yokes they took from their Ploughs.

<P>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> tells us, That the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Tay</HI> was the utmo&s;t Boundary of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire in <HI>Britain:</HI> That <HI>Julius Agricola,</HI> the be&s;t of Generals, under <HI>Do|mitian,</HI> the wor&s;t of Emperors, tho' he pierced far|ther, and traver&s;ed by Land into the Heart of the <HI>Highlands,</HI> yet &s;eeing no End of a barbarous Coun|try, and no Advantage by the Conque&s;t of it, with|drew, and here fixed the <HI>Roman</HI> Eagles; that he

frequently hara&s;&s;ed the <HI>Picts</HI> by Excur&s;ions and In|roads, but always returned to his Po&s;t here, making the <HI>Tay</HI> his Frontier.</P>
<P>But our <HI>Engli&s;h Cae&s;ars</HI> have outgone the <HI>Romans</HI>; for <HI>Edward</HI> I. as is &s;aid before, pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Tay,</HI> and rifled the Abbey at <HI>Scoon</HI>; and, if we may believe Hi&s;tory, penetrated into the remote&s;t Parts, which, however, I take to be only the remote&s;t Parts of what was then known to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; for as to the <HI>Highlands,</HI> the Mountains of <HI>Loquhaber, Ro&s;s, Mur|ray, Sutherland,</HI> and <HI>Caithne&s;s,</HI> we read nothing of them: From the&s;e Retreats the <HI>Scots</HI> always returned, <HI>Antaeus</HI> like, with double Strength after every De|feat; till in the next Reign they overthrew his Suc|ce&s;&s;or <HI>Edward</HI> II. at <HI>Bannockbourn,</HI> and drove the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> out of the whole Country; following them over <HI>Tweed</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> and ravaging the Coun|ties of <HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> indeed, (according to the Motto of a noble Hou&s;e in <HI>Scotland, Rode Through</HI>) pene|trated to the remote&s;t Part of the I&s;land; and that he might even literally rule it with a Rod of Iron, built Citadels and Forts in all the Angles and Ex|tremes, where he found it needful to place his &s;ta|tionary Legions, ju&s;t as the <HI>Romans</HI> did; as at <HI>Leith,</HI> at <HI>St. Andrew's,</HI> at <HI>Inverne&s;s, Perth, Aire,</HI> and &s;eve|ral other Places.

<P>It is exceeding populous, full of &s;tately Hou&s;es, and large hand&s;ome Streets; particularly four very good ones, with a large Market-place in the Middle, the large&s;t and faire&s;t in <HI>Scotland,</HI> except that of <HI>Aberdeen.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants have a very large Corre&s;pondence with <HI>England,</HI> and &s;hip off a great deal of Linen thither; and a great Quantity of Corn is &s;ent from hence to <HI>England,</HI> as well as to <HI>Holland.</HI> They have likewi&s;e a good Share of the <HI>Norway</HI> Trade; and as they are concerned in the Herring Fi&s;hery, they con&s;equently have &s;ome Ea&s;t Country Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>Dantzick, Koning&s;berg, Riga,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>The Country behind them called the <HI>Car&s;e,</HI> or the <HI>Car&s;e of Gowry,</HI> with the Vale mentioned above of <HI>Strathmore,</HI> abounds in Corn, which the Port of <HI>Dundee</HI> &s;hips off in large Quantities, when a Crop allows it, to the great Advantage of the Gentlemen as well as Farmers; for as the Gentlemen receive all their Rents in Kind, they would find a great Diffi|culty &s;ometimes to di&s;po&s;e of it, if the Merchants here did not &s;hip it off, either for <HI>London</HI> or <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Dundee</HI> &s;tands at a little Di&s;tance from the <HI>Tay</HI>; but they are joined by a Cau&s;eway or Walk, well paved with flat Free-&s;tone, &s;uch as the Side-ways in <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> and <HI>Cornhill</HI>; and Rows of Trees are planted on either Side of the Walk, which makes it very agreeable. On one Part of this Walk are very good Warehou&s;es for Merchandizes, e&s;pe|cially for heavy Goods; and al&s;o Granaries for Corn
<PB N="180" REF="181">
of which &s;ometimes they have a va&s;t Quantity laid up here; and the&s;e, being near the Harbour, are con|venient, as well for the hou&s;ing of Goods, when landed, as for the ea&s;y &s;hipping off what lies for Exportation.</P>
<P>The Harbour of <HI>Dundee</HI> was formerly very good and &s;afe; but of late Years became &s;o ruinous and choaked up with Sand, that it would not contain, as antiently, Ships of Burden, except at the highe&s;t Tides; and its Piers were &s;o out of Repair, that Ships could not lie in it with Safety. At the &s;ame time the Tolbooth and publick Gaol were &s;o much decay'd, that they were obliged to be pulled down; and the Town, being greatly in Debt be&s;ides, could not rebuild the &s;ame. Wherefore, to an&s;wer all the&s;e good Purpo&s;es, and to pave the Streets, di&s;|charge their Debts, and provide Salaries for School-ma&s;ters to in&s;truct their Children, an Act pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>Anno</HI> 1731. for continuing the Duties impo&s;ed by a former Act, then near expired, of Two-penies <HI>Scots,</HI> upon every Pint of Ale and Beer &s;old within the Town and its Privileges, for 25 Years longer. And the Inhabitants now reap the Benefit of it, and will &s;till more, when the propo&s;ed Works are ab&s;o|lutely perfected.</P>
<P>This Town was &s;torm'd and plunder'd of great Riches by <HI>Cromwell</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army.</P>
<P>The great Church was formerly collegiate, and a very large Building; but part of it was demoli&s;hed in the Civil War; the Remainder is divided into three Churches for the pre&s;ent U&s;e of the Citizens.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a Meeting-hou&s;e or two for the Epi&s;copal Wor&s;hip; for you are to take it once for all, that North of <HI>Tay,</HI> there are far more of the Epi&s;copal Per&s;ua&s;ion than are to be found in the South; and the farther North, the more &s;o.</P>
<P>The Tower upon the great Church here is a hand&s;ome &s;quare Building, large and antient, and

very high, and is a good Ornament to the City: It re&s;embles the great Tower upon the Cathedral of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> but not quite &s;o high. There is a fine and well-endowed Ho&s;pital for decay'd Town&s;men of <HI>Dundee,</HI> where they are well taken care of, and provided for.

<P>It was the Birth-place of <HI>Hector Boetius,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Hi&s;torian; a Man famous in his Time, and who&s;e Work was antiently more in E&s;teem, than of late. It gave the Title of Vi&s;count to <HI>Graham</HI> of <HI>Clavers,</HI> who commanded the Forces that ap|peared for the late King <HI>James</HI> at the Revolution, and was killed at the Battle of <HI>Gillicranky,</HI> which I have mentioned.</P>

<P>It is 20 <HI>Scots</HI> Miles from <HI>Dundee</HI> to <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> the Way plea&s;ant, the Country fruitful, and filled with Gentlemens Hou&s;es. Among the&s;e is the noble Palace of <HI>Panmure,</HI> forfeited in the late Re|bellion by the unfortunate Earl of that Name, who was wounded in the Fight near <HI>Dumblain.</HI> The Surname of the Family is <HI>Maul</HI>; and <HI>Maul&s;burgh,</HI> a &s;mall Town near <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> is called from it.</P>
<P>The Town and Port of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> was our next Stage, &s;tanding upon the Ea&s;tmo&s;t Shore of <HI>Angus,</HI> open to the <HI>German,</HI> or the <HI>Caledonian</HI> Ocean, and at the Mouth of the little River of <HI>Southe&s;k,</HI> which makes the Harbour.</P>
<P>This Town is well &s;ituated for Trade, and has a good Harbour, and the Inhabitants always carried on an advantageous Trade with <HI>Norway.</HI> But as it was &s;till capable of great Improvements, were a Dock to be made for the Conveniency of Shipping; and if good fre&s;h Water could be procured for it, of which
<PB N="182" REF="183">
it &s;tood in very great Want; and the two Hills that defend the Town again&s;t Inundations, having al&s;o &s;uffered by Tempe&s;ts; the Corporation procured an Act, <HI>Anno</HI> 1719. for laying a Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every Pint of Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;old within the Town and its Privileges, for effecting the&s;e good Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The Town is adorned with fine Buildings, and has an Ho&s;pital for the poorer Inhabitants. It gives Title of Duke, as it did formerly of Earl and Mar|quis, to the Chief of the antient and noble Family of <HI>Graham.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Fleet fir&s;t made Land at this Port, when they had the <HI>Pretender</HI> on board, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> having over-&s;hot the Mouth of the <HI>Firth</HI> &s;o far, whither they at fir&s;t de&s;igned; but this Mi&s;take, which &s;ome thought a Misfortune, was certainly a Deliverance to them; for as on one hand it gave time to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet to come up with them before they could enter the <HI>Firth,</HI> &s;o it left them time and room al&s;o to make their E&s;cape; which, if they had gone up the <HI>Firth,</HI> they could never have done, but mu&s;t inevitably have been burnt and de|&s;troyed, or taken by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fleet under Sir <HI>George Byng,</HI> which was &s;uperior to them in Force.</P>
<P>The Royal Burgh of <HI>Aberbrothock</HI> on this Coa&s;t, be&s;ides being famous for the &s;tately Ruins of the greate&s;t Abbey in <HI>Scotland,</HI> de&s;erves to be mentioned for its convenient Situation for Trade; which in|duced, &s;ome Years &s;ince, the Inhabitants to lay the Foundation of a new Harbour, the old one being &s;o decayed, that it was hazardous even for &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;els to &s;ail into it. But the Work exceeding their Abilities, they procured Contributions towards &s;o good a De&s;ign; but &s;till all proving &s;hort of what was requi&s;ite to complete the Work, and the Town having run it&s;elf into Debt by what it had done, and at the &s;ame time the publick Streets and
<PB N="183" REF="184">
Cau&s;eways, as well as the Town-hou&s;e and Gaol, being in a very ruinous Condition, they procured an Act to pa&s;s in the 11th of King <HI>George</HI> II. for laying a Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale or Beer &s;old within the Town and Liberties, which was to commence in <HI>May</HI> 1738. and to con|tinue for 25 Years, for bringing to Effect the&s;e good Purpo&s;es. And we may &s;ay, that of late &s;o many of the&s;e Acts have pa&s;&s;ed, that <HI>Scotland</HI> will in a few Years, if hara&s;&s;ed by no inte&s;tine Broils, and continuing in Peace, make a better Figure than it has done for Centuries pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Abbey was formerly endowed with great Re|venues by King <HI>William</HI> I. who was buried here under a &s;tately Monument.</P>
<P>In the inner Parts of the Shire, to the We&s;tward, is <HI>Forfar</HI> the County Town, and <HI>Brechin</HI> formerly a Bi&s;hop's See, made &s;o by K. <HI>David,</HI> and where &s;ome Part of a &s;mall Cathedral is &s;till &s;tanding. It is &s;eated upon the River <HI>Southe&s;k,</HI> over which it has a &s;tately Bridge of two Arches, and is con&s;iderable for its Salmon and Cattle-markets. It is al&s;o memorable for a great Victory obtained here over the <HI>Danes,</HI> by the Chief of the Family of <HI>Keith,</HI> Earl Mare&s;chal, who having killed their General, was advanced to great Honours by <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. There was a high Stone erected over the Grave of the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> General, which is &s;till called <HI>Camus's Cro&s;s,</HI> from his Name; and at 10 Miles Di&s;tance is another Cro&s;s, over the Grave of another eminent <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Warrior; and both of them have antique Letters and Pictures upon them.</P>
<P>From <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> the Shore lies due North to <HI>Aber|deen:</HI> In the Way is the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Dunnoter,</HI> once a &s;trong Fortification upon an high Precipice of a Rock. The Ca&s;tle was &s;urrounded with invincible Walls, (&s;aid the hone&s;t <HI>Scot,</HI> who &s;hewed us the Road to it) having Towers at proper Di&s;tances,
<PB N="184" REF="185">
after the old Way of fortifying Towns. The Earl Mare&s;chal, of the Name of <HI>Keith,</HI> was Lord of this Ca&s;tle, as al&s;o of a good Hou&s;e near it, and a great E&s;tate: But what he had, is now gone; for, being in the Rebellion, his E&s;tate was forfeited, and his Lord&s;hip, making his E&s;cape, went into the Service of <HI>Spain,</HI> in which he &s;till continues. But we ought to ob&s;erve, that his Brother, going into the Service of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> made &s;uch a Figure there, that he is a Lieutenant-General in that Empire, and greatly e&s;teemed for his per&s;onal Bravery and Conduct. This Gentleman making, lately, a Vi&s;it to <HI>England,</HI> was received with great Marks of Di&s;tinction and Favour, by the Court and Nobility; and may be truly &s;aid to be one of the be&s;t Generals that the late Czarina, who yet had many excellent Commanders, had Rea|&s;on to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P><HI>Dunnoter</HI> Ca&s;tle is now demoli&s;hed. It is &s;ituated in the Shire of <HI>Kincardin</HI> called the <HI>Merns.</HI> The County is noted for its Timber, having in it up|wards of Five Millions of Fir-trees, be&s;ides va&s;t Numbers of other Kinds, planted within the&s;e 70 Years by the Gentry, at and about their Seats, and which they are yearly adding to, and improving. <HI>Kincardin</HI> was formerly the County-town; but that Advantage now, by Statute, belongs to <HI>Stonehyne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Innerbervy,</HI> on the Coa&s;t, was made a Royal Burgh by King <HI>Alexander</HI> III.</P>
<P><HI>Paldykirk,</HI> &s;o called from <HI>Palladius,</HI> fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of the <HI>Scots,</HI> is noted for its annual three Days Fair: The principal Commodity brought to it is coar&s;e Cloth, which is commonly tran&s;ported to the <HI>Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P>On the Lands of <HI>Arbuthie</HI> and <HI>Redeloak,</HI> are &s;ome Trenches to be &s;een, ca&s;t up by the <HI>Danes</HI> at one of their Inva&s;ions: And round the Hill of <HI>Urie</HI> is a deep Ditch, where the <HI>Scots</HI> encamped.</P>
<P><HI>Fordun</HI> lies al&s;o in this County, famous in antient Times for the Reliques of the afore&s;aid St. <HI>Palladius.</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="186">
It is al&s;o noted for being the Surname of <HI>John For|dun,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Hi&s;torian, Author of the Book called <HI>The Scots Chronicon,</HI> to which all &s;ucceeding Hi&s;to|rians of this Nation have been much obliged.</P>
<P>The Earl Mare&s;chal was hereditary Sheriff of this Country.</P>
<P>We proceeded then to <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> a Place &s;o emi|nent, that it commands &s;ome Stay upon it. It &s;tands at the Mouth of two Rivers, and is divided into two Towns or Cities, one called the <HI>New,</HI> the other the <HI>Old Aberdeen,</HI> about a Mile di&s;tant from each other; one &s;ituate on the River <HI>Don,</HI> the other on the River <HI>Dee,</HI> from whence they are more properly called <HI>Aberdon</HI> and <HI>Aberdeen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aberdon,</HI> or the <HI>Old Town,</HI> lies a Mile Northward from <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> or the <HI>New Town,</HI> and is &s;ometimes called <HI>Bon-accord,</HI> from its Motto. It is &s;ituated in the Mouth of the River <HI>Don,</HI> which is remarkable for the Multitude of Salmon and Perch taken in it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Old Town</HI> mu&s;t, without doubt, be very antient; for they tell us the <HI>New Aberdeen</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to be upwards of 1200 Years old, tho' none of their Regi&s;ters mention the particular Time of its being built, or by whom. The Cities are not equally &s;ituated for Trade, one of the Rivers being broader than the other; and it is the common Opinion, that Part of the old City, called <HI>the Mona&s;tery,</HI> was wa&s;hed down by the Sea, &s;o that it obliged the Citizens to build farther off: That accordingly they built the <HI>New Aberdeen</HI> upon the Bank of the other River, upon a Piece of hilly Ground: But this is all Con|jecture, and has Probability only for its Support.</P>
<P><HI>Old Aberdeen</HI> was formerly the Bi&s;hop's Seat, and has a Cathedral, commonly called <HI>St. Machar</HI>'s, a large and &s;tately Structure, which was antiently much more magnificent: it &s;uffered greatly at the Time of the Reformation, and more &s;ince the Re|volution.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187">The chief Ornament of this Town is the <HI>King's College</HI> on the South Side of it, a neat and &s;tately Structure.</P>
<P>The Church and Steeple are built of hewn Stone, and the Summit of the latter re&s;embles an Imperial Crown. The Windows of the Church were for|merly e&s;teemed for their Paintings; and &s;omething of their Splendor &s;till remains. In the Steeple are two Bells of extraordinary Bigne&s;s, be&s;ides others.</P>
<P>Clo&s;e to the Church is a Library well furni&s;hed with Books.</P>
<P>This College was founded by Bi&s;hop <HI>Elphin&s;ton,</HI> in the Year 1500. and the greate&s;t Part built by him; but King <HI>James</HI> IV. taking the Patronage upon him, it was called <HI>The King's College.</HI> The Bull for it was procured from Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VI. in 1510. endowing it with as ample Privileges as tho&s;e of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Bononia.</HI></P>
<P>There are in this College a Principal, a Sub-prin|cipal, who is al&s;o one of the Regents, three other Regents, or Profe&s;&s;ors of Philo&s;ophy, a Profe&s;&s;or of Humanity or Philology, a Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity, a Doctor of Phy&s;ick, a Profe&s;&s;or of the Oriental Tongues, a Profe&s;&s;or of the Civil Law, and a Pro|fe&s;&s;or of the Mathematicks. Dr. <HI>Frazer</HI> has lately been a great Benefactor to it.</P>
<P><HI>New Aberdeen</HI> is about a Mile di&s;tant, as we have &s;aid, from the <HI>Old,</HI> &s;ituated at the Mouth of the River <HI>Dee.</HI> It is the County Town, and by Con|&s;equence the Seat of the Sheriffs Courts. It exceeds all the Cities in the North of <HI>Scotland</HI> for Large|ne&s;s, Extent and Beauty. It &s;tands in a whol&s;ome Air, has a great Revenue from its Salmon-fi&s;hery, and the Inhabitants are generally very courteous. It &s;tands upon three Hills; the main Part upon the highe&s;t, and the Skirts of it extend into the Plain. The Hou&s;es are neatly built, are generally four Stories high, or more, and have for the mo&s;t part
<PB N="187" REF="188">
Gardens and Orchards belonging to them, which makes the City plea&s;ant and healthful, and the Pro|&s;pect of it beautiful at a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>From a round Hill, at the We&s;t End of the City, flow two Springs, one of clear Water, and another with Water, which, in Ta&s;te and Quality, comes very near the <HI>Spaw</HI> in <HI>Germany:</HI> Dr. <HI>William Barclay</HI> wrote a Treati&s;e concerning it.</P>
<P>In the High-&s;treet is a Church built of Free-&s;tone, and good Architecture.</P>
<P>In this City &s;tands the <HI>Mar&s;hal College,</HI> founded by <HI>George</HI> Earl Mar&s;hal, in the Year 1593. to which the City has added many Buildings at their own Charge.</P>
<P>In this College, which is a di&s;tinct Univer&s;ity of it&s;elf, are a Principal, four Profe&s;&s;ors of Philo&s;ophy, a Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity, and a Profe&s;&s;or of Mathe|maticks, and there is lately added a Profe&s;&s;or of Phy&s;ick. It has a very good Library, which was founded by the City, inlarged by the Gifts of &s;everal learned Men, and furni&s;hed with Mathematical In&s;truments.</P>
<P>In this City is al&s;o a Grammar School, founded by Dr. <HI>Dune,</HI> having one Ma&s;ter and three U&s;hers. There is al&s;o a Mu&s;ick School.</P>
<P>The Church called <HI>St. Nicolas</HI>'s, is a hand&s;ome Edifice of Free-&s;tone, with a lofty Steeple, re|&s;embling a Pyramid; it was formerly divided into three Churches. The Body of this Church is adorned with a Tower, and a Steeple with Pinacles.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a Pri&s;on and a Work-hou&s;e belonging to the Town, likewi&s;e an Alms-hou&s;e, and three Ho&s;pitals; and near the Harbour &s;tands the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. The Market-place is very beautiful and &s;pacious, and the Streets adjoining are very hand&s;ome, and mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es are built of Stone, four Stories high, with hand&s;ome Sa&s;h-windows, and are very well furni&s;hed within; the Citizens here

being as gay, as genteel, and perhaps as rich, as in any City in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Bridge at <HI>Old Aberdeen,</HI> over the <HI>Don,</HI> con|&s;i&s;ts of one immen&s;e Arch of Stone, &s;prung from two Rocks, one on each Side, which &s;erve as a Buttment to the Arch, &s;o that it may be &s;aid to have a Foundation coeval with Nature, and which will la&s;t as long. The other Bridge is upon the River <HI>Dee,</HI> We&s;t above <HI>New Aberdeen,</HI> and has &s;even very &s;tately Arches.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and indeed of almo&s;t all this Country, are generally of the Epi&s;copal Per|&s;ua&s;ion; &s;o that, were it not for the legal E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, the Pre&s;byterian Preachers would have but few Hearers, and &s;lender Incomes: Almo&s;t every Pari&s;h has a Meeting-hou&s;e, where the Liturgy is read: At <HI>Aberdeen</HI> and <HI>Peterhead</HI> they have beautiful Chapels, and even Organs.</P>
<P>Near the City is a &s;tately Stone Bridge of &s;even Arches over the <HI>Dee,</HI> built by Bi&s;hop <HI>Gawin Dumbar.</HI></P>
<P>The Air of this County, to tho&s;e who were born in a hotter, &s;eems cold, but is in it&s;elf healthful and temperate. The Winter is milder than can be ex|pected from &s;uch a Climate, which &s;eems a Wonder to <HI>Danes, Poles,</HI> and <HI>Pru&s;&s;ians,</HI> when they come into this Country, and con&s;ider that with them, during the Winter, there is nothing but perpetual Fro&s;t and Snow. The Soil in general is not un|fruitful, if duly cultivated; it produces Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats in abundance, Pea&s;e and Beans; nor do they want Roots and Herbs for Food and Phy&s;ick; and foreign Plants grow very well there, as daily Experience te&s;tifies. The mountainous Part of the County affords very good Pa&s;turage, and the other as good Corn.</P>
<P>The adjoining Sea not only furni&s;hes them with plenty of Fi&s;h, but reproaches them with their Negligence, when they &s;ee the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleets conti|nually

fi&s;hing on the Coa&s;ts, from whence they reap great Gain; but 'tis the Humour of the Inhabitants to apply them&s;elves to the Salmon-fi&s;hing, and to neglect that of all other Sorts.</P>
<P>The Quantity of Salmon and Perches, taken in both Rivers, is a kind of Prodigy. The Proprietors are united into a Company, there being &s;o many Shares, of which no Per&s;on can enjoy above one at a time. The Profits are very con&s;iderable, the Salmon being &s;ent abroad into different Parts of the World, particularly into <HI>England, France,</HI> the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and &s;everal other Places.</P>
<P>The Herring-fi&s;hing is a common Ble&s;&s;ing to all this Shore of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is like the <HI>Indies</HI> at their Door, were it properly u&s;ed, by the <HI>Scots</HI> in gene|ral: But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that by this, however, the Merchants of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> are able to carry on a Trade to <HI>Dantzick</HI> and <HI>Koning&s;berg, Riga</HI> and <HI>Narva, Wy|bourgh</HI> and <HI>Stockholm.</HI></P>
<P>They have al&s;o a very good Manufacture of Linen, and likewi&s;e of Wor&s;ted Stockens, which they &s;end to <HI>England</HI> in great Quantities, and of which they make &s;ome &s;o fine, that I have &s;een them &s;old for 14, 20, and 30 Shillings a Pair. They al&s;o &s;end them over to <HI>Holland,</HI> and into the North and Ea&s;t Seas, in large Quantities.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a particular Export here of Pork, pickled and packed up in Barrels, which they &s;ell chiefly to the <HI>Dutch</HI> for the victualling their <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dia</HI> Ships and their Men of War, the <HI>Aberdeen</HI> Pork having the Reputation of being the be&s;t cured, for keeping on very long Voyages, of any in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>They export al&s;o Corn and Meal; but they ge|nerally bring it from the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Murray,</HI> or <HI>Cro|marty,</HI> the Corn coming from about <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> where they have great Quantities.</P>
<P>In a word, the People of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> are univer&s;al Merchants, &s;o far as the Trade of the Northern Part
<PB N="190" REF="191">
of the World will extend; and it may be e&s;teemed the third City in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that is, the next after <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI></P>
<P>This Shire contains in it <HI>Mar,</HI> with its Appurte|nances, <HI>Bir&s;e, Glentaner, Glenmuick, Strathdee, Strathdon, Braes</HI> of <HI>Mar</HI> and <HI>Cromar,</HI> mo&s;t part of <HI>Buchan, Formartin, Garioch,</HI> and <HI>Strathbogy.</HI></P>
<P>The latter is a large and antient Barony, watered by the Rivers <HI>Dovern</HI> and <HI>Bogy</HI>; it was erected into an Earldom by King <HI>James</HI> VI. in favour of the Chief of the noble and antient Family of <HI>Gordon,</HI> whom he afterwards created Marquis of <HI>Huntley. Strathbogy</HI> is very fruitful in Corn and Pa&s;turage, and is remarkable for the fine Linen-yarn &s;pun by the Women there, and &s;old to the Merchant.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;tly inhabited by <HI>Gordons,</HI> Va&s;&s;als to the Duke of <HI>Gordon,</HI> who has a magnificent Ca&s;tle here, called <HI>Strathbogy,</HI> from the Name of the County. There are of this Name, be&s;ides the Duke, the Earls of <HI>Sutherland, Aboyn, Aberdeen,</HI> and late Vi&s;count of <HI>Kenmure</HI>; likewi&s;e a great many Gen|tlemen of Note in other Parts of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Mar</HI> gave Title of Earl to the Chief of the Family of <HI>Er&s;kine.</HI> The Sheriffdom is the King's Gift.</P>
<P>In <HI>Aberdeen&s;hire</HI> are Quarries of &s;potted Marble and Slate, and Pearls are found in their Rivers of a large Size, and fine Colour.</P>
<P>There was formerly a Mint at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> as ap|pears by &s;everal Pieces of Coin with the <HI>Aberdeae</HI> upon them, kept in the Clo&s;ets of the Curious.</P>

<P>We ought not to omit, that on the 30th of <HI>October</HI> 1721. an accidental Fire broke out in <HI>Aber|deen,</HI> whereby the Commi&s;&s;ary-Clerk's Office was &s;uddenly con&s;umed, and at the &s;ame time the Re|gi&s;ters and Records of all Te&s;taments and Confirma|tions, all Acts of Curacy, Judicial Deeds, and other Writs and Evidences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were intirely burnt and de&s;troyed; which unhappy Accident being likely to be attended with pernicious Effects to Per&s;ons Rights and Properties, an Act pa&s;&s;ed 8 <HI>George</HI> I. for &s;upply|ing the Records &s;o burnt or lo&s;t; and another in the 9th of the &s;ame Reign, for making the former more effectual.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> had &s;uffered much by the publick Commotions in <HI>Scotland,</HI> after the Revolu|tion took place, &s;o that an Act for laying the Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> on every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale and Beer &s;old within the Town, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had been impo&s;ed by the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Parliament in 1695. and continued by the &s;ame in 1707. for enabling them to di&s;charge the Debts incurred on that Occa&s;ion. And the la&s;t Act being near expired, and Debts &s;till remaining unpaid, an Act pa&s;&s;ed 1731. for continuing the &s;aid Duties, for the following good Purpo&s;es; <HI>viz.</HI> for paying off the remaining Debts of the Town; for building a new Pier on the North-&s;ide of the Harbour, for repairing the old Pier on the South-&s;ide, which was very much &s;unk and decay'd; for repair|ing the great Church, called the <HI>Old Church,</HI> which was in a very decayed Condition; for rebuilding the Town-hou&s;e, which was al&s;o in a very bad State; and for maintaining and carrying on other publick Works for the Benefit of the Town. This Act is to remain in Force for 25 Years; and it may be ea&s;ily judged, that the Town of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> will be much improved, when the propo&s;ed Works are all ab&s;olutely completed.</P>

<P>This Country, however remote, is full of No|bility and Gentry, and their Seats are &s;een even unto the extreme&s;t Shores: The Family of <HI>Frazer</HI> carries its Name to <HI>Frazerburgh,</HI> in the very Northermo&s;t Point of the Country. <HI>Ere&s;kines,</HI> Earls of <HI>Marr,</HI> had their Family-&s;eat at <HI>Kildrummy,</HI> in the County of <HI>Marr,</HI> a little South of this Part of the County, where the late unhappy Earl fir&s;t &s;et up his Standard for the <HI>Pretender.</HI> The <HI>Hayes,</HI> Earls of <HI>Errol,</HI> are in <HI>Buchan</HI>; and the Family of <HI>Forbes</HI> Lord <HI>Forbes,</HI> and <HI>Forbes</HI> Lord <HI>Pit&s;ligo,</HI> are &s;till farther, and the latter on the very Shore of the <HI>Caledonian</HI> Ocean. The <HI>Gordons</HI> and <HI>Keiths</HI> are very numerous al&s;o in the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194">Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> relates, that on the Coa&s;t of this Country a great Piece of Amber was driven on Shore by the Force of the Sea, as big (to u&s;e his own Words) <HI>As an Hor&s;e.</HI> I &s;hall add nothing to the Story, becau&s;e it is hard to give Credit to it: it is enough that I name my Author; for I could not learn from the Inhabitants, that they ever &s;aw any more of it.</P>
<P>I ought not to omit <HI>Innerury,</HI> belonging to <HI>Garioch</HI> in <HI>Aberdeen&s;hire,</HI> being the <HI>Scot&s;man</HI>'s Boa&s;t; for here <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> tho' &s;ick, and carried in a Hor&s;e-litter, defeated <HI>John Cummins,</HI> and tho&s;e who ad|hered to him, in Favour of <HI>Edward</HI> I. of <HI>England</HI>; who held <HI>Scotland</HI> in Subjection. This was the fir&s;t Victory King <HI>Robert</HI> obtained, and laid the Foun|dation of the Overthrow of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> U&s;urpation in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Near the &s;ame Place al&s;o in 1411. <HI>Alexander Steuart,</HI> Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> defeated <HI>Donald</HI> of the I&s;les, in the bloody Battle of the <HI>Harlow.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, the Ea&s;t Shore of <HI>Scotland</HI> being at an End, the Land tends away due We&s;t; and the Shire of <HI>Bamff</HI> beginning, you &s;ee the Towns of <HI>Bamff, Elgin, Frazer&s;burg,</HI> and the famous Mona|&s;tery of <HI>Kinlo&s;s,</HI> where the murdered Body of King <HI>Duff</HI> was after many Years dug up, and di&s;covered to be his by various Tokens.</P>
<P>The Shire of <HI>Bamff</HI> de&s;erves &s;ome Notice for the following Particulars; for that in it is &s;ituated <HI>Strathyla,</HI> which drives a great Trade in Lime, and fat Cattle; and it abounds &s;o with Lime-&s;tone, that they build their Hou&s;es with it. They carry on a Trade in fine Linen al&s;o, by means of their weekly Markets at <HI>Keith,</HI> a neighbouring Village. Upon the Banks of the <HI>Spey,</HI> which runs thro' this County, lies the <HI>Bog of Gicht,</HI> now called <HI>Gordon Ca&s;tle,</HI> the noble&s;t Palace in the North, being the Duke of <HI>Gordon</HI>'s chief Seat, adorned with plea&s;ant Gardens, and a great Park. The Ca&s;tle appears &s;o large, that
<PB N="194" REF="195">
it looks more like a Town than a Nobleman's Seat. The Duke is Proprietor of this Part of the County. <HI>Strathave</HI> is the paternal Inheritance of his Fa|mily: And his Grace has a fine E&s;tate, and other Seats hereabouts. The late Duke had a little embroiled him&s;elf with the Affairs of 1715, and his Son, then Marquis of <HI>Huntley,</HI> &s;till more; but got off without a Forfeiture, by his Prudence and good Fortune.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Cullen,</HI> an antient Royal Burgh, &s;tands in the Shire of <HI>Bamff.</HI> It is chiefly noted for its fruitful Soil, and Salmon-fi&s;hing; for having no Port, it has little Trade, except for its Corn and Salmon.</P>
<P>The Shire it&s;elf takes Name from <HI>Bamff,</HI> a Burgh Royal, &s;eated at the Mouth of <HI>Doverne</HI> in the <HI>Boyne,</HI> where the Sheriff holds his Courts. In it are the Ruins of an old Ca&s;tle, near which is the Abbey of <HI>Deer,</HI> formerly belonging to the <HI>Ci&s;tercian</HI> Monks, and founded by <HI>William Cumin,</HI> Earl of <HI>Buchan.</HI> In <HI>Belvenie</HI> is found the Stone of which Alum is made, and in the County of <HI>Boyne</HI> great Quarries of &s;potted Marble have been di&s;covered.</P>
<P><HI>Buchan</HI> is Part in <HI>Aberdeen&s;hire,</HI> Part in the Shire of <HI>Bamff,</HI> one of its principal Towns is <HI>Frazer&s;burgh,</HI> and <HI>Peterhead</HI> is another. The latter is a good Market-town, with a Port, and &s;mall Harbour with two little Piers for Fi&s;hing; but being &s;o near <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> has not tho&s;e Helps and Advantages, that might be otherwi&s;e probably given to it; &s;o that at low Water it is all dry, and the &s;malle&s;t Ships lie aground in it.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Saltoun</HI> has very lately built, (1738) at <HI>Frazer&s;burgh,</HI> a mo&s;t excellent new Pier and Bulwark, all of Free-&s;tone; which renders that Harbour as &s;afe and commodious as any on the Ea&s;t Coa&s;t; &s;o that 30 Ships may winter there at once, with great Safety: The Water at full Sea is 18 or 20 Feet.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="196">From the Point of Land, called <HI>Buchanne&s;s</HI> the Ships begin their Accounts for their &s;everal Voyages; what they call their Departure: As in <HI>England,</HI> they do from <HI>Wintertonne&s;s,</HI> on the North-ea&s;t Part of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and from the <HI>Downs</HI> for the Voy|ages to the Southward.</P>
<P>From <HI>Fifene&s;s,</HI> which is the Northermo&s;t Point, on the Mouth of <HI>Edinburgh Firth,</HI> being the Souther|mo&s;t Land of <HI>Fife</HI> to this Point of <HI>Buchanne&s;s,</HI> the Land lies almo&s;t due North and South, and the Shore is the Ea&s;termo&s;t Land of <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Di&s;tance between them is 33 Leagues, 1 Mile, which is ju&s;t 100 Miles; tho' the Mariners &s;ay, that mea&s;uring by the Sea, it is but 28; and from <HI>Wintertonne&s;s,</HI> near <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> to this Point call'd <HI>Buchanne&s;s,</HI> is ju&s;t 300 Miles.</P>
<P>The River or <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Tay</HI> opens into the Sea, about four Leagues North from <HI>Fifene&s;s</HI>; and as there is a Light-hou&s;e on the <HI>I&s;le of May,</HI> as I have &s;aid before, in the Mouth of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> a little South of this Point, call'd <HI>Fife|ne&s;s</HI>; there are likewi&s;e two Light-hou&s;es at the Entrance of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Tay,</HI> for the Directions of the Sailors, when they are bound into that River, and particularly for their avoiding the two Sands, which lie off from the South-&s;ide of the Entrance.</P>
<P><HI>Buchanne&s;s</HI> is generally al&s;o the fir&s;t Land of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which the Ships make in their Voyages Home from <HI>Archangel</HI> in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> or from their Whale-fi&s;hing Voyages to <HI>Greenland</HI> and <HI>Spits-bergen</HI> in the North Seas: And near this Point, at <HI>Pit&s;ligo,</HI> a great Ship was ca&s;t away in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, bound Home from <HI>Archangel,</HI> having on board the fir&s;t Emba&s;&s;ador &s;ent by the Great Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> to any of the Chri&s;tian Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> he being commi&s;&s;ioned to treat with Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> for a League of Peace and Commerce. He likewi&s;e lo&s;t a mo&s;t valuable Pre&s;ent, de&s;igned for the Queen, of
<PB N="196" REF="197">
rich and co&s;tly Furrs, in tho&s;e Days, reputed in|e&s;timable. The Emba&s;&s;ador was happily &s;aved, and brought on Shore by the People of <HI>Pit&s;ligo</HI>; but the Ship and all the Goods were lo&s;t.</P>
<P>From this Point of Ea&s;terly Land all that great Bay, or Inlet of the Sea, reaching quite to the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> is called <HI>Murray Firth,</HI> and the Northermo&s;t Point is <HI>Dungsby-head,</HI> which is the North-ea&s;t Point of <HI>Caithne&s;s,</HI> and opens to <HI>Pentland Firth.</HI> By <HI>Pentland Firth</HI> you are to under&s;tand the Pa&s;&s;age of the Sea beyond <HI>Caithne&s;s,</HI> between <HI>Scot|land</HI> and the I&s;les of <HI>Orkney.</HI> What is call'd <HI>Murray Firth,</HI> is not, like many others, the Mouth of a River, as that of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> or <HI>Tay,</HI> but is an open Bay in the Sea, as the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> or the Gulph of <HI>Mexico</HI> are; and reaches, as I have &s;aid, from <HI>Peters-head,</HI> to <HI>Dungsby-head,</HI> oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> the Di&s;tance of 79 Miles; but it is almo&s;t twice as far by Land, becau&s;e of the Depth of that Bay, which obliges us to travel from <HI>Pit&s;ligo</HI> We&s;t, near 70 Miles, till we come to <HI>Inverne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>This County of <HI>Buchan</HI> is more to be taken Notice of from what is to be &s;een on the Sea Shore than in the Land; for the Country is moun|tainous, and in &s;ome Places not very fertile; but as we coa&s;ted along We&s;t, we came into a much better Country, particularly the Shires of <HI>Bamff,</HI> which I have already mention'd, <HI>Elgin,</HI> and the County of <HI>Murray,</HI> from whence the Bay I ju&s;t now de&s;cribed, is called <HI>Murray Firth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Murray</HI> is a plea&s;ant Country, the Soil fruitful, water'd with fine Rivers, and full of good Towns, and Gentlemens Seats more than could be expected in &s;o remote a Part of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>This Country is a Plain for between 20 and 30 Miles together, and the Soil is by that means render'd more fruitful and rich, and the Tempera|ture of the Air more &s;often'd, than in other Parts of
<PB N="197" REF="198">
<HI>Scotland</HI>; in&s;omuch that the Harve&s;t here, and in the Vale of <HI>Strathbogy,</HI> and all the Country to <HI>Inver|ne&s;s,</HI> is ob&s;erved to be more early than in <HI>Northum|berland,</HI> nay, than in <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> and even &s;ome Parts of the more Southerly Counties in <HI>England</HI>; as particularly in the Ea&s;t of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex.</HI> As a Confirmation of this, I affirm that I have &s;een the new Wheat of this Country and <HI>Inverne&s;s</HI> brought to Market to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> before the Wheat at <HI>Edin|burgh</HI> has been fit to reap; and yet the Harve&s;t about <HI>Edinburgh</HI> is thought to be as forward as in mo&s;t Parts, even of <HI>England</HI> it&s;elf. In a Word, it is u&s;ual in <HI>Murray</HI> and the Country about it, to begin with their Harve&s;t in the Month of <HI>July,</HI> and it is not very unu&s;ual to have new Corn fully ripe and thre&s;h'd out, &s;hipped off, and brought to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to Sale, within the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The River <HI>Lo&s;&s;ie</HI> in this County is famous for Sal|mon; there being annually pickled and exported from 80 to 100 La&s;ts, all taken in a few Months of the Sum|mer, and in a Space of one Mile, at a Village called <HI>Germach.</HI> It abounds with Fi&s;h to the very Head; but &s;till the greate&s;t Quantity is u&s;ed for home Con|&s;umption, and taken either with hooked Tridents by Day, or Wicker Ba&s;kets, or little Boats covered with Hides, by Night. None but the Natives, who are u&s;ed to them, will venture into tho&s;e Boats. The common Drink in the&s;e Parts is Ale, and &s;ometimes Beer, and they have good <HI>French</HI> Wine very cheap, as I and my Company experienced; but the Inha|bitants prefer <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> of their own extracting from Ale-dregs and Spices, to much richer Wines than the <HI>French</HI>; of this they drink plentifully them&s;elves, and are very liberal of it to their Friends. And a Bottle of this Liquor, and &s;ome Chee&s;e, will make a <HI>Murray</HI> Man undertake the greate&s;t Winter-Journeys, without wi&s;hing for any other Provi&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="199">This County is divided into two Shires; the greater, called the Shire of <HI>Elgin</HI>; the other, the Shire of <HI>Nairn.</HI> The Town of <HI>Nairn</HI> lies on the Mouth of the River of that Name; along which lie the Seats of many Per&s;ons of Quality.</P>
<P>Near the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Caddel</HI> or <HI>Calder,</HI> on that River, is a Vein of Free-&s;tone, and many Signs of Copper.</P>
<P><HI>Tarnaway</HI> Ca&s;tle, on the River <HI>Findorn,</HI> in this County, is an old Ca&s;tle and Seat belonging to the Earls of <HI>Murray.</HI></P>
<P>A little lower on the other Side, &s;tands the Burgh of <HI>Forre&s;s,</HI> in an exceeding plea&s;ant Situation. The Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> formerly re&s;ided here, in a Ca&s;tle that is now gone to Ruin; and lower, formerly, &s;tood the noble Abbey of <HI>Kinlo&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>On the Road to <HI>Forre&s;s</HI> is a large Pillar of one Stone, being a Monument of a Victory obtained by King <HI>Malcolm Mac Kenneth</HI> over <HI>Sueno</HI> King of <HI>Denmark</HI>; the In&s;cription is now worn out. Be|twixt this Place and <HI>Elgin,</HI> are numberle&s;s Seats of the Quality.</P>
<P>In this rich County, on the River <HI>Lo&s;&s;ie,</HI> which ri&s;es a few Miles above it, and empties it&s;elf into the Sea a few Miles below it, lies <HI>Elgin,</HI> formerly a Bi&s;hop's See. It is &s;ituated in a very fruitful Soil, tho' &s;omewhat &s;andy. The Ruins of the Ca&s;tle are &s;till to be &s;een on the Ea&s;t End of the Town; tho' demoli&s;h'd &s;o long ago, as the Wars of the <HI>Danes.</HI> There was a noble Cathedral here, which for Large|ne&s;s, Splendor, Magnificence and Workman&s;hip, had hardly its Equal in the Kingdom. The u&s;ual Place of Re&s;idence of the Bi&s;hop was at the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Spynie,</HI> within a Mile of the Town, a very noble Seat, with fine Gardens and Woods.</P>
<P>But tho' the Town of <HI>Elgin</HI> has Rea&s;on to be proud of its Situation, it was not very rich in its Town Revenues; for it had long laboured under
<PB N="199" REF="200">
heavy and burden&s;ome Debts; which being increa&s;ed by the Rebellion in 1715. put a Stop to divers of its new publick Works, and made &s;everal others run into Decay. At the &s;ame time the River <HI>Lo&s;&s;ie</HI> having very in&s;ufficient Banks, the Chanel of it became choaked with Sand, which made it &s;ubject to overflow; and moreover, the Harbour of <HI>Lo&s;&s;ie</HI> it&s;elf, which may be called the Port of <HI>Elgin,</HI> lying not far from it, became ruinous and decayed, to the great Prejudice of Per&s;ons trading in the <HI>Murray</HI> Firth, as well as to the Town. For all the&s;e Rea&s;ons, and in order to inlarge and im|prove, as well as repair, the &s;aid Harbour of <HI>Lo&s;&s;ie,</HI> an Act pa&s;&s;ed in the Year 1721, laying a Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> on every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale or Beer, that &s;hould be vended within the &s;aid Town and its Liber|ties; &s;o that it bids fair to make as flouri&s;hing a Figure as it has done for Centuries pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Above <HI>Elgin, Forre&s;s</HI> and <HI>Nairn,</HI> lies that Part of the Country called, <HI>The Bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Murray,</HI> no way comparable to the lower Part for Fruitfulne&s;s; and beyond this are Mountains, Woods, and green Valleys; particularly <HI>Strathherin,</HI> well inha|bited, and abounding with little Towns and Vil|lages, and <HI>Strathnairn,</HI> a &s;till better Soil, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;everal Gentlemen. <HI>Strathherin</HI> al&s;o abounds with Lakes, Mountains and Streams.</P>
<P>In this County lies <HI>Lochmoy,</HI> with an I&s;land, where the Laird of <HI>Mackinto&s;h</HI> (a Name well known in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> as well as <HI>Scotland,</HI> by means of the famous Bri|gadier of that Name, who was taken Pri&s;oner at the Battle of <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> e&s;caped out of <HI>Newgate,</HI> and lately died in Peace in <HI>Scotland</HI>) has his Seat. This Tribe is called <HI>Clan Chattau</HI>; and are numerous in this County.</P>
<P>But to &s;ay a few Words more of <HI>Elgin,</HI> before we leave this County: Gentlemen of all Parties and Opinions, as if this Town was the Court for this Part of the I&s;land, leave their Highland Habitations in the Winter, and come to live at <HI>Elgin,</HI> with very
<PB N="200" REF="201">
engaging Freedom; &s;o that it is a Place of greater Re&s;ort than could be imagined, at the Di&s;tance of 450 mea&s;ured Miles from <HI>London,</HI> and more, if we mu&s;t go by <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>This rich Country continues with very little In|termi&s;&s;ion, till we come to <HI>Strathnairn,</HI> or the Valley of <HI>Nairn,</HI> where it extends a little farther in Breadth towards the Mountains, and is not inferior to the other in Fruitfulne&s;s: From the we&s;tern Part of this County you may ob&s;erve that the Land goes away again to the North; and, as if you were to enter into another I&s;land beyond <HI>Britain,</HI> you find a large Lake or Inlet from the Sea of <HI>Murray,</HI> going on We&s;t, as if it were to cut through the I&s;land; for we could &s;ee no End of it, nor could &s;ome of the Country-people tell us how far it reached, but that it went beyond <HI>Lochaber:</HI> So that we thought, till our Maps and further Inqui&s;ition informed us, it had joined the We&s;tern Ocean.</P>
<P>After we had travelled about twelve Miles, and de&s;cended from a ri&s;ing Ground, upon which we then were; we perceived the Lake contracted in one par|ticular Place to the ordinary Size of a River, as if de&s;igned by Nature to give Pa&s;&s;age to the Inhabitants to conver&s;e with the Northern Part; and then it opened again to its former Breadth, and continued in the Form of a large Lake, as before, for many more Miles than we could &s;ee; being in the Whole, according to Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> 23 Miles long; but if it be taken on both Sides the Pa&s;s, 'tis above 35 Miles in Length.</P>
<P>This Situation mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make the narrow Part a mo&s;t important Pa&s;s, from the more Southerly Parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Northern Countries, which are beyond it. We have been told, the <HI>Romans</HI> ne|ver conquered thus far, and the Conque&s;ts of <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> have been much magnified on this Ac|count; but if what Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> records, and is confirmed by other Accounts from the Men of
<PB N="201" REF="202">
Learning and Ob&s;ervation, be true, this mu&s;t be a Mi&s;take; for we are told, that near <HI>Bean</HI> Ca&s;tle in the County of <HI>Nairn,</HI> there was found, in the Year 1406. a fine Marble Ve&s;&s;el curiou&s;ly carved, which was full of <HI>Roman</HI> Coins of &s;everal Sorts; al&s;o &s;everal old Forts or Mounts have been &s;een here, which, by their Remains, evidently &s;hewed them&s;elves to be <HI>Roman.</HI></P>
<P>I now entered the Shire of <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> abounding with large Woods of Firr and Oak, and having in it &s;ome Iron Mines. It contains <HI>Badenock, Locha|ber,</HI> and the South and We&s;t Parts of <HI>Ro&s;&s;e,</HI> and the I&s;le of <HI>Sky</HI>; of all which I &s;hall &s;peak, as they offer in the Cour&s;e I took.</P>
<P>In the narrow Pa&s;s mentioned above, over the Lake &s;tands the Town and Fortre&s;s of <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> that is, a Town on the inner Bank of the River <HI>Ne&s;s.</HI> The Situation of it (as I have &s;aid before) intimates, that it is a Place of Strength; and accord|ingly it has a Ca&s;tle, founded in antient Times to command the Pa&s;s: And &s;ome Authors write, that it was antiently a Royal Hou&s;e for the Kings of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Be that as it will, <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> thought it a Place of &s;uch Importance, that he built a &s;trong Citadel here, and kept a &s;tated Gari&s;on always in it, and &s;ometimes more than a Gari&s;on; finding it needful to have a large Body of his old veteran Troops po&s;ted here to pre&s;erve the Peace of the Country, and keep the <HI>Highlanders</HI> in Awe, which they did effectually all his Time.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, that at the End of tho&s;e trouble&s;ome Days, when the Troops on all Sides came to be di&s;|banded, and the Men di&s;per&s;ed, abundance of <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Soldiers &s;ettled in this fruitful Part of the Country, from whence it received two Advantages:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They learnt the Art of Hu&s;bandry in full Per|fection, which they did not under&s;tand before; which, with the Help of a rich Soil, has rendered this Part
<PB N="202" REF="203">
of the Country more fruitful than the re&s;t of <HI>Scot|land</HI> to this Day. And to this it is in &s;ome mea&s;ure owing, that the Harve&s;t is &s;o early, and the Corn &s;o good, as is ob&s;erved above.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Soldiers initiated them thus into the Arts and Indu&s;try of the Hu&s;bandman, &s;o they left them the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Accent upon their Tongues, which they likewi&s;e pre&s;erve to this Day; for they &s;peak perfect <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> even much better than in the mo&s;t Southerly Provinces of <HI>Scotland</HI>; nay, &s;ome will &s;ay, as well as at <HI>London</HI> it&s;elf.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Their Tongue is not only <HI>Anglici&s;ed,</HI> but their Palates too; their Way of Eating and Cookery, Dre&s;s and Behaviour, is according to the Southern Mode: I wi&s;h they do not, in time, degenerate into Luxury, and forget that military Original which fir&s;t reformed them.</P>
<P>The Fort which was then built, and afterwards demoli&s;hed, has been re&s;tored &s;ince the Revolution, and a Gari&s;on was always kept here by King <HI>William,</HI> for the better regulating the <HI>Highlands</HI>; which Po&s;t was of &s;ingular Importance in the Time of the In|&s;urrection of the Earl of <HI>Marr</HI> for the <HI>Pretender</HI>; when, tho' his Party took it, they were driven out again by the Country with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> and &s;everal other of the Nobility and Gentry, who &s;tood fa&s;t to the King's Intere&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Inverne&s;s</HI> may be &s;aid to be a plea&s;ant, clean, and well-built Town. There are &s;ome Merchants in it, and it has a good Share of Trade. In it the Sheriff keeps his Court. It con&s;i&s;ts of two large hand&s;ome Streets, and has a &s;tately Stone Bridge of &s;even large Arches over the River <HI>Ne&s;s,</HI> where (as I &s;aid before) it grows narrow between the Sea and the Lake. The Water of this River is almo&s;t always warm, and all the Year long is never &s;o cold as to freeze; nay, in the &s;harpe&s;t Winter, if Cakes of Ice are thrown into it, they will be quickly thaw'd by its
<PB N="203" REF="204">
Warmth. Small Ve&s;&s;els may come up to the Town; but larger Ships, which often come thither for Corn, are forced to lie at &s;ome Di&s;tance Ea&s;t from it.</P>
<P>But it has been lately improved, and is &s;till far|ther improving; for in the Year 1718 an Act pa&s;&s;ed, for laying a Duty of a Sixth of a Peny Sterling on every Pint of Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;old within the Town and its Privileges, for building a Church and making a Harbour there. The Preamble to the Act, giving a De&s;cription of the Place, and the Rea&s;ons of applying for it, I &s;hall in&s;ert, and is to the fol|lowing Effect:</P>
<P>That the Town of <HI>Inverne&s;s</HI> is &s;ituate near the Sea, and very capable of Improvements in its Trade and Commerce, and having but a very &s;mall publick Revenue, incumbered with Debts, and tho&s;e in|crea&s;ed by the Expence the Inhabitants were at in oppo&s;ing the Rebellion of 1715. And the Church of the &s;aid Town, be&s;ide, being ruinous, was not large enough to contain the Inhabitants; for the effecting of the&s;e good Purpo&s;es the &s;aid Act was pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This Act was to be in Force for 19 Years only; and the fir&s;t five Years it produced &s;o well, that the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Inverne&s;s</HI> entered upon a De&s;ign greatly to inlarge and improve their Harbour; in order to which they purcha&s;ed Grounds, rented Quarries, built Boats for tran&s;porting Stone, deepened their Harbour, erected Bulwarks and Quays; &s;o that it was made much more commodious than ever: But the next 13 Years the Produce of the Duties was &s;o low, occa&s;ioned by the exce&s;&s;ive U&s;e of run Tea and Brandy, which People could buy &s;o cheap, that the Con&s;umption of Beer and Ale was greatly le&s;&s;ened, and they having run much behind-hand, were forced to apply for a further Continuation of the Act; and accordingly, in the 11th Year of King <HI>George</HI> II. an Act pa&s;&s;ed for continuing the &s;ame for
<PB N="204" REF="205">
21 Years more, for paying the Debts contracted, and effecting the other good Purpo&s;es I have mentioned. Which, when done, will make <HI>Inver|ne&s;s</HI> a Place of as great Account as any in the North of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>When we are over the Bridge of <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> you enter that which we truly call the North of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and others the North <HI>Highlands</HI>; in which are &s;everal di&s;tinct Shires, but cannot call for a par|ticular De&s;cription, becau&s;e they are all one un|di&s;tingui&s;hed Range of Mountains and Woods, over|&s;pread with va&s;t and almo&s;t uninhabited Rocks and Steeps filled with Deer innumerable of various Kinds; among which are &s;ome of tho&s;e the Antients called <HI>Harts</HI> and <HI>Roebucks,</HI> with over-grown Stags and Hinds of the Red-deer Kind.</P>
<P>Before I de&s;cribe this frightful Country, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that <HI>Scotland</HI> may be divided into four Di&s;tricts, which I have not &s;een any of our Geographers do before me; yet, I believe, may not be an improper Mea&s;urement for &s;uch as would form a due Idea of the Whole in their Minds.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>South-land,</HI> or that Part of <HI>Scotland</HI> South of the River <HI>Tay,</HI> drawing a Line from the <HI>Tay,</HI> about <HI>Perth,</HI> to <HI>Loch-lomond,</HI> and down to <HI>Dumbar|ton,</HI> and the Bank of <HI>Clyde.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2.

</LIST></P>
<P>According to this De&s;cription, having pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge over the River <HI>Ne&s;s,</HI> I am now entered on the third Divi&s;ion of <HI>Scotland</HI> called the <HI>North-land.</HI> Here are not only the be&s;t Hawks of all Kinds, but Eagles in great Numbers, which prey upon the young Fawns when they fall fir&s;t, and upon Wild Fowl, with which this Part of the Country abounds.</P>
<P>The Rivers and Lakes al&s;o in this Country are &s;o prodigiou&s;ly full of Salmon, that it is hardly credible what Quantities are taken in the <HI>Spey,</HI> the <HI>Nairn,</HI> the <HI>Ne&s;s,</HI> and other Rivers hereabout.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Countries beyond the <HI>Ne&s;s</HI> are, <HI>Ro&s;s, Sutherland, Strathnavern, Caithne&s;s,</HI> and beyond tho&s;e the I&s;lands of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sutherland</HI> is called the Shire of <HI>Dornoch,</HI> from the chief Town of the Province called <HI>Dornoch,</HI> a Royal Burgh, noted for a Ca&s;tle belonging to the Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI>; for its Cathedral Church for the Dioce&s;e of <HI>Caithne&s;s,</HI> which once was Part of this Shire; and for its four annual Fairs. It has three remarkable Fore&s;ts, be&s;ides abundance of other Woods, which afford plea&s;ant Hunting and Fowling. One &s;ort of Bird is peculiar to this Country, called <HI>Knug,</HI> which re&s;embles a Parrot, and digs its Ne&s;t in the Trunks of Oak, with its Beak. There are about 60 Lakes in this County: The greate&s;t is <HI>Loch&s;kin,</HI> 14 Miles in Length; in many of them are I&s;lands very plea&s;ant for Summer Habitations. In the I&s;le of <HI>Brora,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI> has a Hou&s;e, which he makes u&s;e of when he comes to hunt Deer, which abound in it; and in &s;ome of the Lakes and Rivers of this County, as well as in the Rivers of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;&s;e,</HI> are found Pearls of great Value. In &s;hort, this Shire &s;o abounds with Lakes, Rivers, and Bays, that there is &s;carce a Farm in the whole County,
<PB N="206" REF="207">
but is wa&s;hed either with fre&s;h or &s;alt Water, &s;o that the Inhabitants have Store of Fi&s;h and Fowl. The Beer or Big in this County is reckoned excellent. It has al&s;o Silver Mines, and excellent Iron Mines, Coal Mines, and Quarries of Free-&s;tone, but much neglected. It has many commodious Harbours for Ships to export its Commodities; which are Cod, Salmon, &s;alt Beef, Wool, Skins, Hides, Tallow, Butter, Chee&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Bays and Coa&s;ts al&s;o abound with Seals, have &s;ometimes Whales, and Shell Fi&s;h of all &s;orts.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI> has a Ca&s;tle beyond <HI>In|verne&s;s,</HI> called <HI>Dunrobin,</HI> &s;ituate on the Ea&s;tern Shore, of which his Lord&s;hip was &s;ent down by Sea to take an early Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the late Rebellion; and which if he had not done, would &s;oon have fallen into the Hands of the late Earl of <HI>Marr</HI>'s Party; but his coming timely thither, prevented him and the Country on that Side, from joining the Troops of the <HI>Pretender.</HI> In the Gardens of this Seat, tho' &s;o Northerly, Saffron grows very well, and comes to Maturity.</P>
<P><HI>Strathnavern</HI> is Part of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> and derives its Name from <HI>Strath,</HI> a Valley, &s;ituated on the River <HI>Navern,</HI> which runs thro' it. The Country is moun|tainous, and formerly was noted for breeding greater Numbers of ravenous Wolves than any other in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Bays and Rivers are full of Fi&s;h; it is very woody, and many Lakes are in the Val|leys. There are &s;everal Monuments in it, of Victories gained over the <HI>Danes,</HI> particularly one at <HI>Enbo,</HI> which is a Stone Cro&s;s, &s;aid to be over a <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> King. The Inhabitants are great Hunters, and de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who are not; &s;o that Veni&s;on with them is a common Di&s;h. The Situation of the Country not admitting of Towns, the Inhabitants live up and down in &s;mall Villages. On the Northern Coa&s;t of this County are &s;everal I&s;lands.
<PB N="207" REF="208">
Of the many Lakes, <HI>Lochnavern</HI> and <HI>Lochyol</HI> are the large&s;t, and the latter affords an I&s;land which is inhabited in the Summer time. <HI>Borwe</HI> and <HI>Young,</HI> are the Places of mo&s;t Note, the latter the principal Seat of the Lord <HI>Rea,</HI> Chief of the <HI>Mackays,</HI> who is the principal Proprietor of <HI>Strathnavern</HI>; but holds it of the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> to who&s;e elde&s;t Son it gives the Title of Lord. The Earls of <HI>Suther|land</HI> were formerly of the Name of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> to the Heire&s;s of which a Son of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Gordon</HI> mar|ried, from whom the pre&s;ent Earl is de&s;cended. They have a long time claimed Precedency, as the fir&s;t Earls of the Kingdom, and in order to recover it, have re-a&s;&s;umed their former Name. They have great Royalties, as being Admirals of that, and &s;ome of the neighbouring Counties, and all the Gentlemen of <HI>Sutherland</HI> hold of them. Lord <HI>Duffus</HI> is de&s;cended of this Family. The Earl is Hereditary Sheriff of it. The County has &s;everal Mountains of white Marble, as we were told.</P>
<P>North of the Mouth of the River <HI>Ne&s;&s;e,</HI> is the famous <HI>Cromarty</HI> Bay, or <HI>Cromarty</HI> Firth, noted for being the fine&s;t Harbour, with the lea&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s, perhaps, of any in <HI>Britain.</HI> It is 15 Miles long, and in many Places two Miles broad; and, like <HI>Milford-haven</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> is able to receive the Royal Navy of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> both to go out and come in with Safety; but, for want of Trade, this noble Harbour, which by Geographers and Mariners, is called <HI>Portus Salutis,</HI> or <HI>the Harbour of Safety,</HI> is become almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The Shire of <HI>Cromarty</HI> is denominated from a Royal Burgh, &s;tanding upon the Firth of <HI>Cromarty.</HI> The Waters of <HI>Connel</HI> are celebrated for the Pearls found in them. Of great Part of this County the Earl of <HI>Cromarty</HI> is Sheriff and Proprietor. The Straths or Valleys upon the Water-&s;ide abound with Woods. Particularly, upon the Hills is great
<PB N="208" REF="209">
Store of all &s;orts of Game; al&s;o near <HI>Al&s;erig,</HI> upon the Waters of <HI>Braan,</HI> and on the <HI>Carron,</HI> are great Woods of Fir.</P>
<P>All the County beyond the River <HI>Ne&s;&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Loch</HI> flowing into it, is called <HI>Caithne&s;s,</HI> and extends to the Northermo&s;t Land in <HI>Scotland.</HI> It is divided from <HI>Sutherland</HI> by the Mountain <HI>Ord,</HI> and a Tract of Mountains running from it as far as <HI>Knochfin.</HI></P>
<P>Some People tell us they have Lead, Copper, and Iron in this Part of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and I am very much inclined to believe it; but it &s;eems re&s;erved for a future and more indu&s;trious Age to &s;earch into it. Should a Time come, when the&s;e hidden Trea&s;ures of the Earth &s;hall be di&s;covered and improved, this Part of <HI>Scotland</HI> would be no longer e&s;teemed poor; for &s;uch a Production would &s;oon change the Face of Things, bring Wealth and Commerce to it, fill the Harbours with Ships, the Towns with People, and by con&s;uming the Provi&s;ions, occa&s;ion the Soil to be cultivated, the Fi&s;h cured, the Cattle con|&s;umed at Home, and thereby diffu&s;e Pro&s;perity all around them.</P>
<P>Our Writers have repre&s;ented the Inhabitants here wild and barbarous: They were &s;o formerly, per|haps; but we &s;ee the <HI>Mackenzies, Macleods, Suther|lands, M^c Leans, M^c Donalds, Gordons, M^c Keys, Macfergu&s;ons, M^c Into&s;hes,</HI> and others &s;prung from thence, equally accompli&s;hed for the Court or Camp.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned, here are but few Towns; the People live di&s;per&s;ed in Clans under a kind of Va&s;|&s;alage, &s;ubmitting to their Lords as their lawful Monarchs, and many of them acknowledge no other; tho' this too, is in a manner got over, and the Clans are le&s;s dependent on their Chiefs, than they u&s;ed to be, by virtue of an Act of Parliament made for that very Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Their Employment is chiefly Hunting for their Food, tho' they al&s;o breed large Quantities of Black
<PB N="209" REF="210">
Cattle, with which they pay their Lairds or Leaders the Rent of the Lands. The&s;e Cattle are driven annually to <HI>England</HI> to be &s;old, and are bought up chiefly in the Counties of <HI>Norfolk, Suffolk,</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>; as I have mentioned in &s;everal Places in my <HI>Tour.</HI></P>
<P>There are many little Towns and Villages, be&s;ides Gentlemens Seats in <HI>Caithne&s;s,</HI> as far North as it is: But the People are more addicted to good Living within Doors, than to &s;hewy Edifices, or fine Seats. The be&s;t Hou&s;e in it, is Ca&s;tle <HI>Sinclair,</HI> &s;o called from the Name of the Earls of <HI>Sinclair,</HI> who&s;e Seat it is, and they have &s;everal other Ca&s;tles in the County. The Lord <HI>Sinclair</HI> of <HI>Raven&s;heugh</HI> in <HI>Fife</HI> is chief of the Name. His Ance&s;tors formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland,</HI> and were allied to the Royal Family of <HI>Denmark.</HI> But one of the Family &s;quandered away his E&s;tate, and among the re&s;t, the&s;e I&s;lands; and got for it the inglorious Title of, <HI>William the Wa&s;ter.</HI> The chief Town and Royal Burgh in <HI>Caithne&s;s</HI> is <HI>Wick</HI> or <HI>Weich,</HI> whence it is called the Shire of <HI>Weich.</HI> This Town lies conveniently for Trade, and has a good Harbour for Ships on the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t. It is the Re&s;idence of the Sheriff, or his Officer.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;o,</HI> another Town with a good Harbour, lies al&s;o on the Northern Coa&s;t, in a little Bay. The I&s;les of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland,</HI> I refer to the Account of the I&s;les.</P>
<P>And I &s;hall ob&s;erve, once for all, that I am the more particular in my De&s;cription of the&s;e Northern Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> becau&s;e they are lea&s;t known, and le&s;s valued and e&s;teemed than they de&s;erve.</P>
<P>This County is &s;urrounded with the Sea, and tho&s;e two great Inlets of Water, mentioned above, called the <HI>Ne&s;s</HI> and the <HI>Abre:</HI> So that it forms a Penin&s;ula, by means of that &s;mall Neck of Land of about eight Miles long, which Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls the <HI>Garrow</HI> or <HI>Glengarrough,</HI> others <HI>Glengary.</HI> Were
<PB N="210" REF="211">
it not for this, the whole Divi&s;ion of the <HI>North|land</HI> would be a di&s;tinct I&s;land, &s;eparated from all the re&s;t of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as effectually as the <HI>Ork|neys</HI> or the I&s;le of <HI>Skye</HI> is from this.</P>
<P>That Part which lies to the Ea&s;t, is open to the Sea, without Cover; the We&s;t and the North are, in a manner, &s;urrounded with Out-works as a Defence to break off the raging Ocean from the North; for the We&s;tern I&s;lands on one Side, and the <HI>Orkneys</HI> on the other, lie as &s;o many advanced Fortifications or Redoubts, to combat that Enemy at a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>From <HI>Dunrobin</HI> Ca&s;tle you have nothing of Note offers it&s;elf, either by Sea or Land, but an extended Shore lying North and South, without Towns, and without Harbours; and as there are none of the former to be found, &s;o there are none of the la&s;t wanting.</P>
<P>The Land thus extended lies North and South to <HI>Dung&s;by-head,</HI> which is the utmo&s;t Extent of it, on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Britain</HI> North, and is di&s;tant from <HI>Cromarty</HI> 18 Leagues North. From this Point of <HI>Ding&s;by</HI> or <HI>Dung&s;by-head,</HI> as I ob&s;erved before of <HI>Buchan</HI> and <HI>Winterton,</HI> the Sailors take their Di&s;tances, and keep their Accounts in their going farther North; <HI>e. g.</HI></P>
<P>From this Point of <HI>Ding&s;by-head</HI> to the <HI>Fair-i&s;le</HI> or <HI>Faro,</HI> which is the fir&s;t of <HI>Shetland,</HI> or the la&s;t of the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> (call it which you will; for it lies be|tween both) is 25 Leagues, or 75 Miles.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame <HI>Dung&s;by-head</HI> to <HI>Sumburgh-head,</HI> that is, to <HI>Shetland,</HI> is 32 Leagues, or 96 Miles, and to <HI>Lerwick</HI> Fort in <HI>Shetland</HI> 110 Miles.</P>
<P>Thus from <HI>Buchanne&s;s</HI> to <HI>Sumburgh-head</HI> in <HI>Shet|land,</HI> is 47 Leagues.</P>
<P>And from <HI>Wintertonne&s;s</HI> near <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> to <HI>Buchanne&s;s,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> is ju&s;t 100 Leagues. So from <HI>Winterton</HI> to <HI>Shetland</HI> is 147 Leagues, or 431 Miles.</P>
<P>I am now to ob&s;erve, that we are here at the ex|treme&s;t Point of the I&s;land of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; and
<PB N="211" REF="212">
that here the Land bears away We&s;t, leaving a large Streight or Sea, which they call <HI>Pictland,</HI> or <HI>Pentland Firth,</HI> and which divides between the I&s;land of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the I&s;les of the <HI>Orkneys</HI>; a Pa&s;&s;age broad and fair; for 'tis not le&s;s than five Leagues over, and has a &s;ufficient Depth of Water for Ships to &s;ail in: But the Tides are &s;o fierce, &s;o uncertain, and the Gu&s;ts and &s;udden Squalls of Wind &s;o fre|quent, that very few Merchant Ships care to venture thro' it, and the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships, which come North about, (as 'tis called) in their Return from <HI>India,</HI> keep all farther off, and chu&s;e to come by <HI>Fair-i&s;le,</HI> in the Pa&s;&s;age between the I&s;lands of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland</HI>; whither they generally &s;end their Men of War to meet them, being &s;ure of not mi&s;&s;ing them in &s;o narrow a Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>But the Pa&s;&s;age here is much broader, being at lea&s;t nine Leagues from North <HI>Ranal&s;ha,</HI> the farthe&s;t I&s;land of the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> to <HI>Fair-i&s;le,</HI> and five more from <HI>Fair-i&s;le</HI> to <HI>Shetland:</HI> So that it is 14 Leagues clear open Sea between the <HI>Orkneys</HI> and <HI>Shetland,</HI> with only a &s;mall I&s;land in the Way, which has nothing dangerous about it.</P>
<P>In the Pa&s;&s;age between the Land's End of <HI>Britain</HI> and the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> is a &s;mall I&s;land, which our Mari|ners call <HI>Stroma,</HI> Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> and others, <HI>Sowna</HI>; and is much &s;poken of as dangerous for Ships: But I &s;ee no room to record any thing of that kind, any more than the Report, that it is haunted by Witches and Spirits, which draw Ships on Shore to their Misfortune.</P>
<P>At <HI>Dung&s;by-head</HI> is the mo&s;t Northerly Land of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> where, in the Month of <HI>June,</HI> after a clear Day, we could &s;ee to read the &s;malle&s;t Print, and to write di&s;tinctly, all Night long, without the Help of a Candle.</P>
<P>No wonder the antient Mariners, be they <HI>Phoe|nician</HI> or <HI>Carthaginian,</HI> who knew nothing of the Motion of the heavenly Bodies, when they were
<PB N="212" REF="213">
driven thus far, were &s;urpri&s;ed to find they had lo&s;t the &s;teady Rotation of Day and Night, which they thought had &s;pread over the whole Globe. They imagined the <HI>Ely&s;ian</HI> Fields mu&s;t lie this Way, when they found they were come already to the Realm of everla&s;ting Day.</P>
<P>From hence We&s;t we go along the Shore of the <HI>Firth,</HI> which they call <HI>Pentland,</HI> where is the famous Hou&s;e called <HI>John a Grot</HI>'s. We &s;et our Hor&s;es Feet into the Sea, on the mo&s;t Northerly Land, as the People &s;ay, of <HI>Britain,</HI> tho', I think, <HI>Dung&s;by|head</HI> is as far North. 'Tis certain, however, the Difference is but very &s;mall, being either of them in the Latitude of 59&frac16; North, and <HI>Shetland</HI> reaching above two Degrees farther. The Dominions of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are extended from the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> in the Latitude of 50 Degrees, to the I&s;les of <HI>Un&s;ta</HI> in <HI>Shetland,</HI> in the Latitude of 61 Degrees 30 Minutes, being 10 Degrees, or full 600 Miles, in Length; which I&s;land of <HI>Un&s;t</HI> or <HI>Un&s;ta,</HI> being the mo&s;t remote of the I&s;les of <HI>Shetland</HI> to the North-ea&s;t, lies 167 Leagues from <HI>Wintertonne&s;s</HI> in <HI>Nor|folk.</HI></P>
<P>Here we found, however mountainous and wild the Country appeared, the People extremely well furni&s;hed with Provi&s;ions, e&s;pecially four Sorts in great Plenty; two of them &s;ufficient for a common Table, the other two the Splendor of the greate&s;t

<ITEM>2. Veni&s;on exceeding plentiful, and at all Sea&s;ons, young or old, which they kill with their Guns where|ever they find it, for there is no Re&s;traint; on which Account all the Highlanders have Fire-arms, and become excellent Mark&s;men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Salmon in &s;uch Plenty as is &s;carce credible, and con&s;equently &s;o cheap, that to tho&s;e who have any Sub&s;tance to buy with, it is not worth giving

them&s;elves any Trouble to catch it. This they eat fre&s;h in the Sea&s;on, and at other times cured by being dried in the Sun, and &s;o pre&s;erved all the Year.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They have no want of Cows and Sheep, but the latter are &s;o wild, that &s;ometimes, were they not, by their own Di&s;po&s;ition, u&s;ed to flock together, they would be much harder to kill than the Deer.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>From hence to the We&s;t Point of the Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Orkney</HI> is near 20 Miles, which may be called the End of the I&s;land of <HI>Britain,</HI> which faces directly to the North Pole, &s;o that the Tail of the <HI>Great Bear</HI> is &s;een ju&s;t over your Head. The Day is here, in Summer, &s;aid to be 18 Hours long, the Sun remaining &s;o long above the Horizon; and when he is &s;et, he makes &s;o &s;mall an Arch of a Circle below the Horizon, that it is much above a Twilight all the Night; but it mu&s;t be remembered, that the dark Nights take in Winter their Turn, and are protracted to as great a Degree.</P>
<P>Yet it is ob&s;ervable here, that they have more temperate Winters, generally &s;peaking, than we have in the mo&s;t Southerly Part of the I&s;land; and parti|cularly, the Water in &s;ome of the Rivers, as in the <HI>Ne&s;s,</HI> for Example, never freezes (as I have ob&s;erved before); which is accounted for from the Nearne&s;s of the Sea, which filling the Air with &s;alt Vapours, &s;heathes, as it were, the acute Particles of the Cold.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame Rea&s;on the Snows are not &s;o deep, nor do they lie &s;o long upon the Ground, as in other Places. The Summits indeed of the high Hills, whither the&s;e Vapours cannot reach, are continually covered with Snow, and perhaps have been &s;o for many Ages, &s;o that this Country, if any in the World, agrees with the following De&s;cription:

If we may believe the Inhabitants, they are large enough to make Ma&s;ts for the bigge&s;t Ships; and yet are of no Service, merely for want of the Con|venience of Water-carriage to bring them away. But methinks, rather than they &s;hould remain an u&s;e|le&s;s Burden to the Earth, they might be cut down and burnt, from whence might be drawn va&s;t Quan|tities of Pitch, Tar, Ro&s;in, Turpentine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is of ea&s;ier Carriage, and would well an&s;wer the Trouble. Indeed an Attempt has been made of this kind for Pot-a&s;h; but it did not &s;ucceed, rather thro' the Fault of the Undertakers at <HI>London,</HI> than any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>And now leaving the Northern Pro&s;pect, we pa&s;s the oppo&s;ite Point We&s;t from <HI>Dung&s;by-head,</HI> and which the People call <HI>Farro-head,</HI> tho' Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls the&s;e two Points by two different Names: The Ea&s;t Point, or <HI>Dung&s;by-head,</HI> he calls <HI>Virvedrum Promontorium.</HI> The We&s;t Point, or <HI>Farro-head,</HI> he calls <HI>Sarvedrum Promontorium.</HI></P>
<P>From hence the va&s;t We&s;tern <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean appears, for which the Geographers have not agreed upon a Name, there being no Country to derive it from.</P>
<P>And now we were to turn our Faces South; for as to the I&s;lands of this Sea, which make the fourth Divi&s;ion of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as I mentioned before, I &s;hall take notice of them under one Head, in the Con|clu&s;ion of my <HI>Tour.</HI></P>
<P>In our Attempt to come down to the Southward by the Coa&s;t of <HI>Tayne,</HI> and the Shire of <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> we &s;hould have been extremely di&s;appointed, and per|haps
<PB N="215" REF="216">
have been obliged to get a Ship or Bark, to have carried us round the I&s;le of <HI>Skye</HI> into <HI>Locha|ber,</HI> had it not been for the extraordinary Courte&s;y of &s;ome of the Gentlemen of the Country.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we unexpectedly met here &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, who were employ'd by Merchants in the South, to take and cure a large Quantity of White-fi&s;h, and afterwards of Herrings, on account of Trade. Here we had not only the Civility of their A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Accommodation in our Journey, but the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing what Progre&s;s they made in their Undertaking.</P>
<P>As for the Herrings, the Quantity of them was prodigious. The Shoal was beginning to come, when we fir&s;t came to the Head of <HI>Pentland Firth</HI>; and in a Fortnight's time, the Body of their num|berle&s;s Shoals began to appear; but before we left the Coa&s;t, you would have ventur'd to &s;ay of the Sea, as they do of the River <HI>Tibi&s;cus,</HI> or <HI>Thie&s;&s;e</HI> in <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> that it was one third Water, and two thirds Fi&s;h. The Operation of taking them could hardly be called Fi&s;hing; for they did little more than dip for them into the Water, and take them up. I make no Scruple to &s;ay, that if there had been 10,000 Ships to have loaded with them, they might all have been filled. The Fi&s;h did not &s;eem to &s;tay, but pa&s;&s;ed on to the South, that they might &s;upply other Parts, and make way al&s;o for tho&s;e innumerable Shoals which were to come after.</P>
<P>Had the Quantity of White-fi&s;h been any way proportioned to the Herrings, there would, no doubt, have been &s;uch Encouragement to the Merchants, that they would never have given it over; but they found it would not fully an&s;wer: Not but that there were great Quantities of Cod, and the Fi&s;h were &s;ize|able and good; but as they are taken with Hook and Line, they could not with any Di&s;patch get a &s;uffi|cient

<P>The Bay of <HI>Tayne</HI> is un&s;afe for Ships, runs a great way up into the County, divides <HI>Ro&s;&s;e</HI> from <HI>Suther|land,</HI> and ends at the Promontory of <HI>Tarbat.</HI> We found the Town of <HI>Tayne,</HI> and &s;ome other Villages, tolerably well inhabited, and &s;ome Trade al&s;o, oc|ca&s;ioned principally by the Communication with the We&s;tern I&s;lands, and al&s;o by the Herring-fi&s;hing, the Fi&s;hing-boats from other Parts often putting into tho&s;e Ports; for all their Coa&s;t is full of Loughs and Rivers, and other Openings, which make very good Harbours for Shipping; and what is remarkable, &s;ome of tho&s;e Loughs are infinitely full of Herrings, even where, as they tell us, they have no Commu|nication with the Sea, &s;o that they mu&s;t have, in all Probability, been put into them alive by &s;ome parti|cular Hands, and have multiplied there, as we find at this Time, if they have not &s;ome Communi|cations with the Sea, which are not di&s;covered to the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>We could under&s;tand no more of what the Peo|ple commonly &s;aid on this Side, than if we had been in <HI>Morocco</HI>; all the Remedy we had was, that we found mo&s;t of the Gentlemen &s;poke <HI>French,</HI> and &s;ome few broad <HI>Scoti&s;h.</HI> It was indeed upon other Accounts much for our Convenience to make the common People believe we were <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Should we go about here to give you an Account of the Religion of the People in this Country, it would be an unplea&s;ant Work, and perhaps &s;carce gain Credit.

<P>The Penin&s;ula which lies betwixt the Bay of <HI>Cromarty</HI> and <HI>Murray</HI> is called <HI>Ardmeanach,</HI> upon the Shore of which &s;tands the Town called, <HI>the Chanonry of Ro&s;s,</HI> formerly a Bi&s;hop's See.

<P>On this Coa&s;t is the I&s;le of <HI>Skye,</HI> lying from the We&s;t-north-we&s;t, to the Ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t, and bear|ing upon the main I&s;land, only &s;eparated by a nar|row Streight of Water; &s;omething like as the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> is &s;eparated from the County of <HI>Southampton.</HI> We left this on our Right, and cro&s;&s;ing the Moun|tains, came, with as little Stay as we could, to the Loughs called <HI>Lochyol,</HI> and <HI>Lochlochy,</HI> which run thro' that large Country called <HI>Lochaber,</HI> that is, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ver</HI> the Lochs, and which &s;ome affect to call the River <HI>Aber</HI> or <HI>Abre, i. e.</HI> the Water which, as I &s;aid above, a&s;&s;i&s;ts, with <HI>Loughne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>Lochne&s;s,</HI> to &s;eparate the North Land of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the middle Part.</P>
<P>This is a long and narrow Inlet of the Sea, in Length above 24 Miles, the Depth unknown, which opening from the <HI>Iri&s;h Sea</HI> South-we&s;t, meets the River <HI>Abre,</HI> or, as the <HI>Scots</HI> much more properly expre&s;s it, the Water of <HI>Abre</HI>; for it is rather a large Lake or <HI>Loch</HI> than a River, and receives innumerable &s;mall Rivers into it. It ri&s;es in the Mountains of <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> or of <HI>Glengary,</HI> within five or &s;ix Miles from the Shore of the <HI>Lochne&s;s,</HI> or the Water of <HI>Ne&s;s,</HI> which is a long and narrow Lake like it&s;elf; and as the <HI>Ne&s;s</HI> runs away Ea&s;t to <HI>Innerne&s;s,</HI> and &s;o into the great Gulph called <HI>Murray Firth,</HI> &s;o the <HI>Abre,</HI> becoming pre&s;ently a <HI>Loch</HI> or Lake, always goes away more to the Southward, and &s;loping South-we&s;t, runs into the <HI>Iri&s;h Seas,</HI> as above.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="220"><HI>Lochaber</HI> is 50 Miles in a &s;trait Line from <HI>Inver|lochy</HI> to <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> and is one of the mo&s;t barren Countries in <HI>North Britain,</HI> tho' the People have Wood, Goats and Deer in Plenty. <HI>Glenco</HI> is almo&s;t the only Town in it; noted for the barbarous and inhuman Ma&s;&s;acre perpetrated there by K. <HI>William</HI>'s Soldiers, quartered in tho&s;e Parts, and who cut off Men, Women and Children without Mercy. A Ma&s;&s;acre that made a great Noi&s;e, and was uni|ver&s;ally dete&s;ted; and what made it &s;till the more odious was, that the Commander in that bloody Work found Friends enough to &s;creen him from the Inquiry that was attempted to be made into the horrid Fact, in order to find out who gave him his Orders for it.</P>
<P><HI>Lochaber</HI> is noted in Hi&s;tory for <HI>Banco,</HI> its gallant Thane, about the Year 1050, who was murdered by the Tyrant <HI>Macbeth,</HI> becau&s;e of a Prophecy, <HI>That his Po&s;terity &s;hould enjoy the Crown for a long Series of Years:</HI> Which accordingly happened; for his Son flying into <HI>Wales,</HI> married the Prince of <HI>North Wales</HI>'s Daughter; by whom he had <HI>Walter,</HI> afterwards Steward of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from whom the Royal Family of <HI>Stuart</HI> was de&s;cended.

<P>On this Water of <HI>Abre,</HI> ju&s;t at the Entrance of the <HI>Loch,</HI> was antiently a Fort built to curb the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> on either Side, called <HI>Inverlochy.</HI> It was formerly of great Strength, and yet often de|&s;troy'd by the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Norwegians.</HI> And at the Revolution, King <HI>William</HI> cau&s;ed it to be rebuilt, or rather erected a new Fort there, which is called <HI>Ca&s;tle William,</HI> as the Village is <HI>Mary-burgh</HI>; and there is always a good Gari&s;on kept in it for curbing the <HI>Highlanders.</HI> It is &s;o &s;ituated, that tho' it may indeed be blocked up by Land, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by a

<P>From <HI>Inverlochy</HI> to <HI>Lochne&s;s</HI> has General <HI>Wade,</HI> with the mo&s;t commendable Indu&s;try and Pains, thro' almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible Mountains, and Mo&s;&s;es, and Mora&s;&s;es, made a mo&s;t convenient Road, which even &s;urpa&s;&s;es (the County con&s;ider'd) what the <HI>Romans</HI> had done with their &s;everal Military Ways; and &s;hews, that the Soldiery might be made u&s;eful even in Times of Peace, and rather a Benefit than a Burden to the Country; and at the &s;ame time &s;o inure them to Toil, Labour, and Hardine&s;s, as would render them fitter for their Country's Service in Time of War. To defend this Road from the Rage of the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> and at the &s;ame time to keep them in Awe, the General built a regular For|tification, which is called <HI>Fort Augu&s;tus.</HI> By this means the <HI>Highlands,</HI> which before were inacce&s;&s;i|ble but by <HI>Highlanders,</HI> who eluded always the Re|&s;entment of their Pur&s;uers, are ea&s;ily entered, and traver&s;ed at the Plea&s;ure of the King's Forces; and even the noted <HI>Rob Roy</HI> him&s;elf, (&s;o famous for his Excur&s;ions and Plunders on the <HI>Lowlands,</HI> and the King's Friends, and who, notwith&s;tanding the Pro|clamations, and Rewards i&s;&s;ued for apprehending him, could never be taken) were he alive, would not be able now to find a Place of Refuge from his Pur&s;uers. And this mu&s;t be in time a great Help to the civilizing of the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> as the Schools e&s;tabli&s;hed among them (of which more by-and-by) will be another.</P>
<P>At this Place we take our Leave of the Third Divi&s;ion, which I call the North Land of <HI>Scotland</HI>; for this Fort, being on the South-&s;ide of the <HI>Loch|aber,</HI> is therefore called <HI>Innerlochy,</HI> as the other for the like Rea&s;on was called <HI>Innerne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>We have nothing now remaining for a full Survey of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the We&s;tern Part of the Middle
<PB N="221" REF="222">
Divi&s;ion of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and this, tho' a large Country, yet affords not an equal Variety with the Ea&s;tern Part of the &s;ame Divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>To traver&s;e the Remainder of this Country, I mu&s;t begin upon the <HI>Upper Tay,</HI> as we may ju&s;tly call it, where I left off, when I turned away Ea&s;t; and here we have in e&s;pecial manner the Countries of <HI>Badenach, Athol</HI> and <HI>Braidalbin:</HI> This is a hilly Country indeed; but as it is water'd by the <HI>Tay,</HI> and many other plea&s;ant Rivers which fall into it, there are &s;everal fruitful Valleys inter&s;per&s;ed among the Hills; nor are even the <HI>Highlands</HI> them&s;elves, or the <HI>Highlanders</HI> the Inhabitants, any thing &s;o wild, untaught, or untractable, as we have been made to believe, and as are to be found in the North Land Divi&s;ion, that is to &s;ay, in <HI>Strathnavern, Ro&s;s, Tain,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Athol</HI> is Lord, I had almo&s;t &s;aid King, of this Country; and has the greate&s;t Number of Va&s;&s;als, of any Nobleman in this, or any Part of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The late Duke was always an Oppo&s;er of the Union in the Parliament holden at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> for pa&s;&s;ing it into an Act; but he did not carry his Oppo&s;ition to a Height of Tumult and Rebellion. If he had, as &s;ome were forward to have had him done, he would po&s;&s;ibly at that time have bid fair to have prevented the Conclu&s;ion of it: But the Hour was come, when the Calamities of War, which for &s;o many hundred Years had vexed the two Nations, were to have an End; and tho' the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Govern|ment had never le&s;s Power than then in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet the Affair was carried thro' with a high Hand, all the little Tumults and Di&s;orders of the Rabble, as well at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> as at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and other Places, being timely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and others by prudent Management prevented.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="223">The Duke has &s;everal fine Seats in this Country; as fir&s;t at <HI>Dunkeld,</HI> upon the <HI>Tay,</HI> which I mentioned before, where there was a Fight between the regular Troops and the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> in the Beginning of the Reign of King <HI>William</HI>; another at <HI>Huntingtour,</HI> in the <HI>Strathern,</HI> or Valley of <HI>Ern,</HI> where the Duke has a fine Park, and great Store of Deer; which may be called his Hunting-&s;eat, whither he &s;ome|times retires for Sport.</P>
<P>He has another Seat at the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Blair,</HI> far|ther North, and beyond the <HI>Tay,</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Braidalbin,</HI> upon the Banks of a clear and fine River, which falls into the <HI>Tay</HI> a few Miles lower.</P>
<P>The Country of <HI>Braidalbin</HI> has not &s;o much as a &s;ingle Village in it of ten Hou&s;es; yet from its <HI>Latin</HI> Name <HI>Albania,</HI> gives oft-times the Title of Duke to &s;ome of the Royal Family; 'tis &s;eated very near the Centre of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is alledged to be the highe&s;t Ground in it, for that the Rivers which ri&s;e here, are &s;aid to run every Way from this Part, &s;ome into the <HI>Ea&s;tern,</HI> and &s;ome into the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Seas.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grampian</HI> Mountains here are &s;aid to cut thro' <HI>Scotland.</HI> As the Country is rough and uncultivated, the Inhabitants are a hardy Race of Men, who make excellent Soldiers, when they are li&s;ted abroad in regular and di&s;ciplined Troops; and I mu&s;t add, that they are much civilized from what they were formerly. The&s;e Mountains abound with Flocks of Black Cattle, Sheep, Hor&s;es, and Goats. The Beef and Mutton are of a delicious Ta&s;te, and the Wool is valued for its Whitene&s;s and Softne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Athol,</HI> tho' he had not (till of late) an E&s;tate equal to &s;ome of the Nobility, yet was Ma&s;ter of more of the Superiorities, as they are called here, than many of tho&s;e who have twice his E&s;tate; and I have been told, that he can bring a Body of above 6000 Men together in Arms at very little Warning.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="224">The Pomp and Grandeur in which this noble Per|&s;on lives, is not to be imitated in <HI>Great Britain</HI>; for he is &s;erved like a Prince, and maintains a greater Equipage and Retinue, than five times his E&s;tate would &s;upport in another Country.</P>
<P>The Duke has al&s;o another Seat in <HI>Strathern,</HI> which is called <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> and which gives Title of Marquis to the elde&s;t Son of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Athol,</HI> for the Time being. At the lower Part of this Country the River <HI>Ern</HI> falls into the <HI>Tay,</HI> and greatly increa&s;es its Waters. This River ri&s;es far We&s;t, on the Frontiers of the We&s;tern <HI>Highlands</HI> near <HI>Glengyl,</HI> and running thro' that plea&s;ant Coun|try called <HI>Strathern,</HI> falls into <HI>Tay,</HI> below <HI>St. John&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Duke is the only Peer that I know of, that is &s;o by Statute, rather than Patent; for his elde&s;t Brother, the Marquis of <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> being attainted for his Adherence to the <HI>Pretender,</HI> the Title would of cour&s;e have failed; but that (toge|ther with the E&s;tate) it was &s;ettled by Act of Parlia|ment on the &s;econd Brother, who is al&s;o Lord of, or King in, the <HI>I&s;le of Man,</HI> and al&s;o Lord <HI>Strange</HI> of <HI>Knocking,</HI> to both which he &s;ucceeded by the Death of his Cou&s;in <HI>James</HI> late Earl of <HI>Derby.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after the <HI>Ern</HI> &s;hoots forth from the Moun|tains, it &s;preads it&s;elf into a <HI>Loch,</HI> as mo&s;t of tho&s;e Rivers do, called <HI>Lochern</HI>; and then runs by <HI>Duplin</HI> Ca&s;tle, the Seat of the Earl of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> who&s;e elde&s;t Son is thence called Lord <HI>Duplin.</HI> The pre&s;ent Earl of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> when Lord <HI>Duplin,</HI> mar|ried the Daughter of the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> when Lord High Trea&s;urer of <HI>England</HI>; and was, on that Occa&s;ion, made a Peer of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> by the Title of Lord <HI>Hay</HI> of <HI>Peperdon.</HI> His E&s;tate here is a very good one, but not attended with Va&s;&s;als and Superiorities, as, I ob&s;erved, the Duke of <HI>Athol</HI>'s is. The &s;everal Owners of this Seat having been pretty

much u&s;ed to re&s;ide in it, have adorned it at &s;everal times, each according to his particular Genius. It has lately received a new Decoration, two Wings being added for Offices as well as Ornament.</P>
<P>The old Building is &s;pacious, the Rooms large, and Ceilings lofty, filled with Furniture &s;uitable to its outward Magnificence, particularly with abun|dance of fine Paintings, &s;ome of the Royal Family, among which is one of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. with a Let|ter in his Hand, held out to his Son the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> afterwards King <HI>James</HI> VII. which they &s;aid he was to have carried to <HI>France.</HI> There is al&s;o a Statue in Bra&s;s of the &s;ame King on Hor&s;e-back; a Picture of <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI>; another of Gene|ral <HI>Monk,</HI> both from the Life.

<P><HI>Duplin</HI> Ca&s;tle is remarkable al&s;o for the greate&s;t Defeat the <HI>Scots</HI> ever received from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward Baliol,</HI> whom the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came to a&s;&s;i&s;t.

<P>From this Place we went to <HI>Brechin</HI> in <HI>Angus,</HI> formerly mentioned, an antient Town with a Ca&s;tle finely &s;ituated; but the Grandeur of it is lo&s;t; the Family of <HI>Panmure,</HI> to whom it belonged chiefly, having forfeited it in the late Rebellion.</P>

<P>The We&s;t <HI>Highlands</HI> contain the Shires or Coun|ties of <HI>Dunbritton</HI> or <HI>Dunbarton,</HI> alias <HI>Lenox, Bute,</HI> and <HI>Argyll,</HI> which la&s;t contains the Di&s;tricts of <HI>Cowal, Knapdale, Lorn</HI> and <HI>Cantyre</HI>; the I&s;les of <HI>Mull, Jura, I&s;la,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Braidalbin</HI> is &s;ometimes reckoned a Part of the North, and &s;ometimes of the We&s;t <HI>Highlands.</HI></P>
<P>On the Banks of the River <HI>Ern</HI> lies a very plea|&s;ant Vale, which continues from the <HI>Tay,</HI> quite up to the <HI>Highlands,</HI> called by <HI>Claudian, Glacialis Ierne</HI>; but now, according to the U&s;age of <HI>Scotland, Strath|ern,</HI> or the Vale of <HI>Ern.</HI> 'Tis an agreeable Country, has many Gentlemens Seats on both Sides the River; but being near the <HI>Highlands,</HI> has often &s;uffered by Depredations in former Times.</P>
<P>In it are many <HI>Roman</HI> Camps; particularly one at <HI>Ardoch</HI>; be&s;ides a <HI>Roman</HI> Highway, towards <HI>Perth.</HI> Several <HI>Roman</HI> Medals have al&s;o been found there, and of late two <HI>Tabulae</HI> curiou&s;ly enamelled with a Sepulchral Stone. The <HI>Ochil-hills,</HI> which run along the South Parts of <HI>Perth&s;hire,</HI> abound with Metals and Minerals; particularly they find good Copper, and <HI>Lapis Calaminaris</HI>; and at <HI>Glen-lion</HI> they meet with Lead. Here is great Want of Coal; but their excellent Peat, and abundance of Wood, &s;upply that Defect.</P>
<P>The Family of <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> who&s;e Chief was &s;acri|ficed for the Royal Cau&s;e in the late Civil Broils, had a &s;trong Ca&s;tle here called <HI>Kincardin,</HI> which was demoli&s;hed in tho&s;e Wars, and is not rebuilt. The
<PB N="226" REF="227">
Ca&s;tle of <HI>Drummond</HI> is almo&s;t in the &s;ame Condition, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ng de&s;erted by its Owners; the two late Earls of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">th,</HI> Father and Grandfather of the pre&s;ent Earl, were forced into Exile for adhering to the late King <HI>James</HI> II. and the <HI>Pretender.</HI> King <HI>James</HI> had the latter in &s;uch E&s;teem, that he not only made him a Duke, and Knight of the Garter, but Governor to the <HI>Chevalier.</HI></P>
<P>The We&s;tern <HI>Highlands,</HI> properly &s;o called, are the only remaining Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which as yet I have not touched upon. This is that particular Country, which a certain Man in King <HI>James</HI> II.'s Time called the Kingdom of <HI>Argyll,</HI> complimenting King <HI>James</HI> upon having conquered two Kings, when he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> whom in Deri&s;ion they called the little King of <HI>Lime,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Argyll,</HI> whom they called, with much more Propriety, the great King of the <HI>Highlands.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' the greate&s;t Part of the&s;e We&s;tern <HI>High|lands</HI> may be &s;aid to be &s;ubject to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Argyll,</HI> or, to &s;peak more properly, to the Family or Clan of the <HI>Campbells,</HI> of whom the Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI> is the Chief, yet &s;ome of the We&s;tern Gen|tlemen are not &s;o blindly guided by their Chiefs as tho&s;e in the North; nor, when led on, are they &s;o apt to commit Outrages and Violence.</P>
<P>But tho' the People are different in the&s;e We&s;tern and Northern <HI>Highlands,</HI> the Countries are much alike; only in the former there are not &s;uch exten&s;ive Woods of Fir-trees, nor &s;uch Quantities of large Eagles.</P>
<P>The People al&s;o dre&s;s alike in both, in the <HI>Plaid</HI> and the <HI>Trou&s;e</HI>; go naked from below the Knee to the Mid-thighs; wear a Durk and a Pi&s;tol at their Girdle, and a Target at their Shoulder.</P>
<P>Some reckon the Shire of <HI>Braidalbin</HI> to belong, as I have &s;aid, to the&s;e We&s;tern <HI>Highlands</HI>; not that it is We&s;t in its Situation, for it is rather North; but,
<PB N="227" REF="228">
I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e one Part of it is inhabited by the <HI>Campbells,</HI> who&s;e Clan, as I have ob&s;erved, generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es mo&s;t of the We&s;t <HI>Highlands.</HI></P>
<P>But if they claim the Country, they will have no Rea&s;on to boa&s;t of the People, who are, if I may give my Opinion, &s;ome of the mo&s;t barbarous and ill-governed of all the <HI>Highlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI>; de&s;perate in Fight, fierce in Conver&s;ation, apt to quarrel, mi&s;chievous, and even Murderers in their Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the Fight which happened at <HI>Gillekranky</HI> in <HI>Athol,</HI> again&s;t the Vi&s;count of <HI>Dundee,</HI> they tell us a Story of a Combat between an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Soldier and a <HI>Highlander.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> under&s;tood the Back-&s;word very well, but the <HI>Scotchman</HI> re|ceived all the Blows upon his Target; and yet at the &s;ame time laid &s;o hard at his Antagoni&s;t with his Broad-&s;word, that he cut him in two or three Places; at which the <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> enraged, rather than di&s;|couraged, cried out to him, <HI>You Dog, come out from behind the Door, and fight like a Man</HI>; but the <HI>Scot,</HI> tho' as brave as the other, knew better things; he pur&s;ued him, in &s;hort, &s;o clo&s;ely, that he was ju&s;t going to kill him, when &s;ome of the Regi|ment, that &s;aw him di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, came up and re&s;cued him, and took the <HI>Highlander</HI> Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>It is hard to &s;ay whether the Northern or We&s;tern <HI>Highlanders</HI> make the be&s;t Soldiers. 'Tis certain they both of them are defrauded of an Honour due to them, when we attribute &s;everal gallant Atchieve|ments to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Battalions Abroad, which were performed by the <HI>Scots.</HI> Thus in particular 'tis &s;aid, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Troops beat the <HI>Germans</HI> out of <HI>Cremona,</HI> after they had got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Town, and had taken the <HI>French</HI> General, the Mar&s;hal <HI>Viller<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> Pri&s;oner: That the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Battalions in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Service behaved gallantly in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and &s;o on many extraordinary Occa&s;ions. Now tho' it is true, that
<PB N="228" REF="229">
the <HI>Scots</HI> came originally from <HI>Ireland,</HI> yet 'tis to be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e Soldiers were mo&s;t of them <HI>Scots Highlanders,</HI> who, upon all Occa&s;ions get over into <HI>France,</HI> there li&s;t among the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Troops; nay, in the late Wars, it has been ob&s;erved, whole Regiments of <HI>Highlanders</HI> have been rai&s;ed for the Service, who, when they were got Abroad, would take the fir&s;t Opportunity to de&s;ert, and go over to the <HI>French,</HI> and &s;o li&s;t in the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Battalions, their original Countrymen, and who &s;till &s;peak the &s;ame Language.</P>
<P>Leaving the Country about <HI>Brechin,</HI> and the <HI>Lowlands</HI> of <HI>Strathern,</HI> we went away We&s;t; but were pre&s;ently interrupted by a va&s;t inland Sea, ra|ther than a Lake, called <HI>Lochlomond.</HI> It is indeed a Sea, and look'd like it from the Hills from whence we fir&s;t de&s;cry'd it. It contains thirty I&s;lands, three of which have Churches, and &s;everal of the re&s;t are inhabited. The chief is <HI>Inchmurin,</HI> about two Miles and a half in Length, fruitful in Corn and Gra&s;s, and abounds with Deer, which the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Kings were accu&s;tomed to hunt there. The others mo&s;t remarkable are <HI>Nacha&s;tel,</HI> &s;o called from the old Ca&s;tle in it. <HI>Inchdavanan,</HI> noted for Broom, abundance of wild Berries, plea&s;ant Habitations, Gardens and Fruit-trees. <HI>Inchonnaugan,</HI> noted for Birch-trees and Corn-fields. <HI>Inchnolaig,</HI> noted for Yew-trees, which grow no-where el&s;e in the&s;e I&s;lands. And <HI>Rougla&s;h,</HI> where the Laird of <HI>Macfarlan</HI> has a hand&s;ome Seat on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Lake. <HI>Kil|maronoch,</HI> a fine Seat once belonging to the Earls of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ils</HI>; but now to the Earl of <HI>Dondonald. Bucha|nan-ca&s;tle,</HI> and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>This Lake or Loch is one of the large&s;t in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> being more than 20 Miles long, and generally eight Miles in Breadth, tho' at the North End of it 'tis not near &s;o broad. It receives many Rivers
<PB N="229" REF="230">
into it, but empties it&s;elf into the Firth of <HI>Clyde,</HI> at one Mouth.</P>
<P>This Lake abounds with Fi&s;h of &s;everal Sorts, particularly a Sort called <HI>Poans,</HI> and by &s;ome <HI>Pol|lacks,</HI> peculiar to it; a Kind of Eel, very delicious to eat. This gave Occa&s;ion to the Mi&s;take of Au|thors, who &s;aid this Lake had Fi&s;h without Fins. So the Beams fa&s;tened together in &s;ome Places of the Lake, by the Inhabitants, and covered with Turf, for them to have recour&s;e to in time of War, and to move from Part to Part, gave Ri&s;e to the Fable of floating I&s;lands here.</P>
<P>The famous <HI>Grampian</HI> Mountains begin near this Lake, and run Northward towards <HI>Aberdeen.</HI></P>
<P>The County of <HI>Lenox,</HI> on which this Lake lies, is in Length about 24 Miles, and in Breadth about twenty. The lower Part is very fertile in Corn; the higher is hilly, moori&s;h, and more fit for Pa&s;ture. It is the paternal E&s;tate and Property of the <HI>Stuarts,</HI> and extends it&s;elf from both Sides the <HI>Levin,</HI> which is the River that (as I &s;aid before) empties the <HI>Loch|lomond</HI> into the <HI>Clyde.</HI> On this Side, Ea&s;tward, <HI>Lenox</HI> joins to <HI>Monteith,</HI> which is Part of <HI>Perth&s;hire,</HI> and runs up for &s;ome Length on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>Loch,</HI> and on the We&s;t-&s;ide it extends to the Edge of the <HI>Lochloing,</HI> and a great way North, almo&s;t to the Mountains of <HI>Lochaber.</HI></P>
<P>All our Writers of the De&s;cription of <HI>Lenox</HI> in|large upon its Family of <HI>Stuarts,</HI> as proceeding from the Royal Line of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and, in &s;ome re|&s;pect, the Royal Line may be &s;aid to proceed from this Hou&s;e, <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Darnley,</HI> elde&s;t Son of <HI>Matthew</HI> Earl of <HI>Lenox,</HI> having been married to Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> by whom he was Father of King <HI>James</HI> the Sixth and Fir&s;t. He was mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly murdered; the Queen was unju&s;tly blamed for it; whereas <HI>Murray</HI> projected it, <HI>Bothwell</HI> put it in Execution, <HI>Morton</HI> and others were privy to it; as
<PB N="230" REF="231">
the &s;aid Earl <HI>Morton,</HI> and others who &s;uffered for it, declared at the la&s;t.</P>
<P>From this Earl <HI>Matthew</HI> de&s;cended <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> and <HI>Richmond,</HI> who dying without I&s;&s;ue, in 1672. the E&s;tate and Honour devolved to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. as Heir at Law, which he conferred on his natural Son by the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and to whom he gave the Surname of <HI>Lenox</HI>; from whom is de&s;cended the pre&s;ent Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>Lenox.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Buchanans,</HI> among many illu&s;trious Names, are originally of this County, whence the famous <HI>George Buchanan,</HI> one of the great Ornaments of his Age for all polite Learning, and not hitherto equalled by any Poet or Hi&s;torian &s;ince his Time, for &s;mooth and elegant <HI>Latin.</HI> But his exce&s;&s;ive Bias for the Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> and his inveterate Prejudice again&s;t the unfortunate Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> has quite lo&s;t him the Title of Impartiality; in&s;omuch, that his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Scotland</HI> was condemned by Act of Parliament, when fir&s;t publi&s;hed, <HI>Anno</HI> 1582. Whence Sir <HI>George Mackenzie</HI> took Occa&s;ion to &s;ay, He was both <HI>Decus &amp; Dedecus Patriae,</HI> the <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Di&s;grace</HI> of his <HI>Country.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dunbarton</HI> is the County Town of <HI>Lenox&s;hire.</HI> It was once con&s;iderable for its Trade, which is now much decay'd; but is &s;till remarkable for its Ca&s;tle, one of the &s;tronge&s;t by Nature in <HI>Europe</HI>; being &s;ecured by the River on one Side, the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Clyde</HI> on the other, by an impa&s;&s;able Mora&s;s on the third, and the fourth is a Precipice: Of this Ca&s;tle the Earl of <HI>Hay</HI> is Governor.</P>
<P>Take <HI>Buchanan</HI>'s De&s;cription of it, to the follow|ing Effect: Betwixt the Conflux of <HI>Clyde</HI> and <HI>Leven</HI> is a Plain about a Mile long, at the End of which, where the Rivers join, is a Rock with two Sum|mits; on the We&s;termo&s;t is a Watch-tower, afford|ing an extended Pro&s;pect into the neighbouring
<PB N="231" REF="232">
Country. The Ea&s;tern Summit is lower; and be|twixt them are Steps cut out of the Rock, pa&s;&s;able only by one Man at a time. When any Part is cut or falls off from the Rock, it emits a &s;ulphureous Smell. At the upper Part of the Ca&s;tle is a great Rock of Load&s;tone. The Rock is very &s;teep on all Sides but towards the <HI>Clyde,</HI> where the A&s;cent is more ea&s;y; and betwixt the two Rocks is a Space of Ground inclo&s;ed by Art and Nature, which contains many Hou&s;es, makes a &s;afe Harbour for Ships, under Protection of the Ca&s;tle, and opens a Pa&s;&s;age for Boats to the very Gate. On the A&s;cent in the Middle are Hou&s;es which look like another Ca&s;tle, &s;eparated from the former. The &s;ame &s;erves for a Ditch on the We&s;t, and the <HI>Clyde</HI> on the South; and the Tide comes up to the Ea&s;t-&s;ide; and on the North, where the Rock is &s;teep, is a green Plain. Three Wells are in the Ca&s;tle always flowing with Water, be&s;ides many Springs; &s;o that it may well be deemed impregnable. The Town lies about half a Mile from it, on the Bank of the <HI>Levin.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Wall, which begins at <HI>Abercorn,</HI> runs thro' this County, and ends at <HI>Kilpatrick</HI> on <HI>Clyde,</HI> a Regality of the Lord <HI>Blantyre</HI>'s.</P>
<P>We now entered the large extended Country of <HI>Argyll,</HI> or the We&s;tern I&s;lands, commonly called, <HI>the Shire of Innerary,</HI> from the principal Town, where the Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI> has his Re&s;idence. It comprehends, as I have &s;aid, <HI>Argyll&s;hire, Knapdale, Caval, Kintyre,</HI> and <HI>Lorn,</HI> with the We&s;tern I&s;les of <HI>Coll, Illcollimkil, I&s;la, Jura, Li&s;more, Mull, Te|reff,</HI> and <HI>Wy&s;t.</HI> It is 120 Miles long, and 40 broad. It joins to <HI>Perth&s;hire</HI> on the Ea&s;t, to <HI>Lochaber</HI> on the North-ea&s;t, to the I&s;les on the North-we&s;t, and to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea on the South.</P>
<P><HI>Kintyre</HI> is a Penin&s;ula, which runs 30 Miles out into the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea, and is no more than 13, &s;ome &s;ay 16 Miles from <HI>Ireland. Campbel-town,</HI> made a
<PB N="232" REF="233">
Royal Burgh by King <HI>William,</HI> with a &s;afe Har|bour for Ships, lies in this County. <HI>Camden</HI> &s;ays, the People of this Part, formerly made Excur&s;ions into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the Pro|vinces of <HI>Gline</HI> and <HI>Rowle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Knapdale</HI> joins to <HI>Kintyre</HI> on the North by a narrow Neck of Land, &s;carce a Mile over, thro' which the People of the Country draw their &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, to avoid &s;ailing round to <HI>Kintyre.</HI> It abounds with Lakes and Bays, &s;everal of which contain I&s;lands and Ca&s;tles; and the Soil is generally fitter for Pa&s;turage than Cultivation; yet it produces Corn in great Plenty.</P>
<P><HI>Lorn</HI> is the plea&s;ante&s;t and mo&s;t fruitful Part of the Shire of <HI>Argyll.</HI> The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Dun&s;tafage</HI> &s;tands in this County, formerly a Royal Seat, where &s;everal of the antient Kings are buried. The Family of <HI>Campbell</HI> was made Earls by King <HI>James</HI> II. of <HI>Scot|land.</HI> They were a long time Lords Ju&s;tices Gene|ral of the Kingdom; but &s;urrendered that Office to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. on a valuable Equivalent, be&s;ides having the Juri&s;diction of <HI>Argyll</HI> and the I&s;les, and are &s;till Great Ma&s;ters of the King's Hou&s;hold in <HI>Scotland.</HI> They derive their Surname from the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Campbell,</HI> and according to <HI>Camden,</HI> their Pedigree from the antient Kings of <HI>Argyll,</HI> by a long Series of Ance&s;tors. The Earl of <HI>Loudon,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Braidalbin,</HI> the Earl of <HI>I&s;la,</HI> and other great Men, are of this Family.</P>
<P>The whole Shire of <HI>Argyll,</HI> taking in the above Parts, has &s;even Bays of the Sea entering into it, called, by the Inhabitants, <HI>Lochs</HI>; the chief is <HI>Lochfyn,</HI> famous for the Number and Goodne&s;s of its Herrings; it is &s;aid to be about 40 Miles in Length, and at the narrowe&s;t Place about four in Breadth. <HI>Lochew,</HI> according to Bi&s;hop <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> is almo&s;t as large as <HI>Lochlomond,</HI> and contains twelve I&s;lands, in one of which is the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Enconel,</HI> in another
<PB N="233" REF="234">
that of <HI>Gleurquhart,</HI> and where it enters the Sea, abounds with Salmon. The Sea-coa&s;t of <HI>Argyll,</HI> or as far as <HI>Lochfyn,</HI> abounds with high Rocks, and black Mountains covered with Heath, which afford Pa&s;turage for Black Cattle and Deer. The Black Cattle run for the mo&s;t part wild, but are excellent Meat; and their Fat, when boiled, does not congeal, as others, but continues for &s;ome Days like Oil. The Inhabitants make great Profit of them by &s;elling them to the <HI>Lowlanders.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI> is hereditary Sheriff of this County. 'Tis an old Right of this Family, that when they marry any Daughter, their Va&s;&s;als are obliged to pay their Portion, and are taxed in order to it, according to the Number of their Cattle.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Mull</HI> of <HI>Cantyre</HI> you &s;ee <HI>Ireland</HI> very plain, it being not above 15 or 16 Miles from the Point of Land, which they call the <HI>Mull,</HI> to the Fair <HI>Foreland,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Colrain,</HI> on the North of <HI>Ireland.</HI> In the Mouth of this Sea of <HI>Clyde</HI> lies a Rock, &s;omewhat like the <HI>Ba&s;s</HI> in the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth,</HI> or of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> not for Shape, but for this Particular, that at the <HI>Ba&s;s</HI> the <HI>Solan</HI> Gee&s;e are noted to come in the Sea&s;on of the Fi&s;hery, and then fly back again. This I&s;land is called the <HI>Ailzey.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall here mention the I&s;les of <HI>Bute</HI> and <HI>Arran. Buchanan</HI> &s;ays, that of <HI>Bute</HI> is eight Miles long, and four broad; Bi&s;hop <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> that it is 10 Miles long. It is fruitful in Corn and Pa&s;turage. It has a Royal Burgh called <HI>Roth&s;ay,</HI> with an antient Ca&s;tle. From this the Royal Family of <HI>Stuart</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to derive their Origin: And Duke of <HI>Roth&s;ay</HI> is now one of the Titles of the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> It has another Ca&s;tle called the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Kermes,</HI> and four Churches. This I&s;land lies in the Mouth of the <HI>Clyde,</HI> eight Miles We&s;t from <HI>Arran,</HI> and is re|markable for its Herring-fi&s;hing. The I&s;le of <HI>Bute</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="235">
gives Title of Earl to a Branch of the noble Family of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who is the chief Proprietor, and he|retable Coroner of the I&s;land, and has a Seat at <HI>Ro&s;a</HI>; as <HI>Callartine</HI> has at <HI>Kermes,</HI> and <HI>Stuart</HI> of <HI>A&s;cog</HI> another. Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> before &s;he married Lord <HI>Darnley,</HI> conferred upon him the Title of Duke of <HI>Roth&s;ay.</HI> Near <HI>Bute</HI> are two &s;mall I&s;lands, called <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Little Cumbrays,</HI> the Property of the Earl of <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI></P>
<P>The I&s;le of <HI>Arran,</HI> which with <HI>Bute</HI> make up one Sheriffdom, lies al&s;o in the Mouth of the <HI>Clyde,</HI> 24 Miles in Length, and near 16 broad, fruitful in Corn and Pa&s;turage. It is very well inhabited on the Coa&s;t, and is a &s;afe and good Harbour, covered by <HI>Lamla&s;h</HI> or the <HI>Holy I&s;le.</HI> It has two Churches, and &s;everal Ca&s;tles, of which that of <HI>Brodich</HI> is the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t noted, and is the Re&s;idence of the <HI>Hamilton</HI> Family when in the&s;e Parts, who al&s;o have a Fore&s;t here containing about 400 Head of Deer; and the I&s;land gives Title of Earl to the Duke of that Name. The I&s;land has &s;everal Rivers in it, which abound with Salmon, as the Sea about it does with Herrings, Cod and Whitings.</P>
<P>The People are Prote&s;tants, &s;peak the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Language, and are &s;till compo&s;ed of &s;everal Tribes or Clans. The mo&s;t ancient are <HI>Mac-Lewis,</HI> of <HI>French</HI> Extraction, in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> named <HI>Fullerton,</HI> and Lairds of <HI>Kirk-Michael,</HI> where they re&s;ide.</P>
<P>The&s;e two I&s;lands are &s;urrounded with a tumultous and dangerous Sea, e&s;pecially in a hard South-we&s;t Wind, which brings the Sea rolling in upon them in a frightful manner. But the above Harbour of <HI>Lamla&s;h</HI> &s;tands them in great &s;tead in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Now we are upon the&s;e We&s;tern Coa&s;ts, I &s;hall mention, that in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1740. an Attempt was made by Diving, to come at one of the large&s;t Ships of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Armada, &s;tranded in 1588. on the&s;e Coa&s;ts. Another was dived for &s;ome

<P>The Country People had pre&s;erved by Tradition the Spot pretty near where &s;he &s;unk, and gave them all the Information they were able: Immediately the Divers went to Work, and &s;wept for her, which they do thus: They have a long Line, which they &s;ink with Leads; one End of the Rope is fixed to one Boat, and the other End to another; they row; and whatever interrupts them, the Diver goes down to make a Di&s;covery. They &s;oon happened on the Place where the Ship lay, which is &s;carce a Quarter of a Mile from the Shore, in ten Fathom and a Foot Water. Captain <HI>Roe</HI> immediately went down, and found the Ve&s;&s;el to be very intire, to have a great Number of Guns on board, but to be full of Sand. The fir&s;t Thing he fixed upon was a Cannon, which lay upon the Sand at the Head of the Ship: To this he fixed his Tongs, which are made of &s;trong Bars of Iron; they are open when they are let down, and have Teeth which join into one another. As &s;oon as they are fixed upon any thing, he gives the Signal, when they are made to &s;hut, and the heavier the Subject, the clo&s;er they hold. The Cannon was drawn up with a good deal of Difficulty; it mea&s;ures full nine Feet, is of Bra&s;s, greeni&s;h-coloured, but nothing the wor&s;e. On the Breach there is a <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> with an <HI>E</HI> on the one Side and an <HI>R</HI> on the other, with this In&s;cription, <HI>Richard and John Philips, Brethren, made this Piece, Anno</HI> 1584. But we may be allowed to ob&s;erve, That by the <HI>E. R.</HI> on the Cannon, which denotes <HI>Eliz. Regina,</HI> and the <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> as al&s;o the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> In&s;cription of the Makers, it &s;hould &s;eem
<PB N="236" REF="237">
to us, that it could not belong to the Armada; but rather to &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, that might have been ca&s;t away there. Ten of the&s;e Bra&s;s Cannon, and ten Iron ones, have been &s;ince carried into <HI>Dublin</HI>; and they hope to recover &s;ixty out of this Ship. The Guns were all charged, and the Metal of &s;ome, by lying &s;o long under Water, moulders away like Clay.</P>
<P>Several People have &s;craped the Iron Guns, which are as mouldy as Bricks; and by keeping the Metal &s;ome time in their Hands, it grows &s;o hot, that they are not able to bear it; but when it is expo&s;ed two or three Hours in open Air, it lo&s;es all its burning Quality. This is accounted for in the following Manner; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Tournefort,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Phy&s;ician, in his <HI>Voyage to the Levant,</HI> Part I. &s;ays: It is certain, that the Filings of Iron, &s;teeped in common Water, will grow con&s;iderably warm, and much more &s;o in Sea Water. And if you mingle therewith &s;ome Sulphur powdered, you will really &s;ee this Mixture burn.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> in the la&s;t Edition of his <HI>Opticks, Pag.</HI> 354. &s;ays: That even the gro&s;s Body of Sul|phur, powdered with an equal Weight of Iron Filings, and a little Water made into a Pa&s;te, acts upon the Iron; and in five or &s;ix Hours grows too hot to be touched, and emits a Flame.</P>
<P>Now it is certain, that ca&s;t Iron contains a great deal of Bitumen or Sulphur in its Compo&s;ition, and that Iron in its &s;en&s;ible Quality effects Heat, and cannot be perceived without the Admi&s;&s;ion of Air; which is the Rea&s;on why the Scrapings &s;hould grow hot, altho' the Guns are actually cold to the Touch.</P>
<P>As I have given Accounts of &s;everal publick Cha|rities, and other laudable In&s;titutions, in the Southern Parts of <HI>Britain,</HI> it would be inexcu&s;able not to mention the Society in <HI>Scotland</HI> for propagating Chri&s;tian Knowledge in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> it being one of the worthie&s;t De&s;igns of the pre&s;ent Age; and as
<PB N="237" REF="238">
we &s;hall include in it al&s;o a De&s;cription of the &s;aid <HI>Highlands,</HI> and of the <HI>Scots</HI> I&s;lands be&s;ides; we cannot in&s;ert it in a more proper Place. It is comprehended in a Letter written <HI>June</HI> 1739. from a Gentleman who is a great Encourager of this noble In&s;titution, to his Friend; and is as follows: <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"The Extent of the <HI>Highlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is much greater than has commonly been imagined: From the <HI>Mull</HI> of <HI>Kintyre</HI> to <HI>Farohead</HI> in <HI>Strath|navern,</HI> is more than 200 Miles in a &s;trait Line from South to North; and from <HI>Farohead</HI> to <HI>John a Grot</HI>'s Hou&s;e, is above 60 Miles along the North and Northern Coa&s;t of the Continent: Be|&s;ides, there is a va&s;t Number of inhabited I&s;lands, of which &s;ome are both large and populous: For in&s;tance, <HI>Jura</HI> is 24 Miles long; <HI>I&s;la,</HI> 16; <HI>Mull,</HI> 24; <HI>Skye,</HI> 48; <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> comprehending <HI>Bara, Southui&s;t, Northui&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Lewes,</HI> 100; and many others, from two to 12 Miles in Length. The I&s;les of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zetland</HI> are to be con&s;idered by them&s;elves; for to <HI>Orkney</HI> alone belong thirty-three inhabited I&s;lands, one of which is 24 Miles, and another 12, in Length. In <HI>Zetland</HI> there are about 30 inhabited I&s;lands, &s;ome of which are &s;ix, others &s;even Miles long. Many of the&s;e I&s;lands lie at con&s;iderable Di&s;tances from the Con|tinent, and from one another, and are in Extent about one half of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>"In this large Track of Country, Ignorance and Super&s;tition greatly prevail: In &s;ome Places, the Remains even of Pagani&s;m are &s;till to be found; and in many others, the Reformation from Po|pery has never yet obtained. The Pari&s;hes where Mini&s;ters are &s;ettled, are commonly of very great Extent, &s;ome 30, 40, 50 Miles long, and ge|nerally divided by impa&s;&s;able Mountains and Lakes; &s;o that mo&s;t of the Inhabitants, being
<PB N="238" REF="239">
de&s;titute of all Means of Knowledge, and with|out any Schools to educate their Children, are intirely ignorant of the Principles of Religion and Virtue, live in Idlene&s;s and Poverty, have no Notion of Indu&s;try, or Sen&s;e of Liberty; are &s;ubject to the Command of their Popi&s;h di&s;affected Chieftains, who have always oppo&s;ed the propa|gating Chri&s;tian Knowledge, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, that they might with le&s;s Difficulty keep their mi&s;erable Va&s;&s;als in a &s;lavi&s;h Dependence. The poorer Sort have only the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Tongue, and little Corre&s;pondence with the civilized Parts of the Nation, and only come among them to pillage the more indu&s;trious Inhabitants: They are brought up in Principles of Tyranny and Arbitrary Government, depend upon foreign Papi&s;ts as their main Support, and the native <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> as their be&s;t Corre&s;pondents and Allies. This has been the Source of all the Rebellions and In&s;urrections in that Country &s;ince the Revolution.</P>
<P>"On the other hand, they are naturally of a quick Genius, of great bodily Strength, inured to Hard&s;hip. Their Country is commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated for the noble&s;t Fi&s;hery in the World, of which our Neighbours have made immen&s;e Profit. They have Mines and Woods, and great Quan|tity of Black Cattle, and va&s;t Tracks of im|proveable Land, which lie wa&s;te for want of Indu&s;try in the People, and not con&s;idering the Advantage of their Situation. They are a nu|merous and prolifick People; and, if reformed in their Principles and Manners, and u&s;efully em|ployed, might be made a con&s;iderable Acce&s;&s;ion of Power and Wealth to <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Some Clans of <HI>Highlanders,</HI> well in&s;tructed in the Arts of War, and well affected to the Government, would make as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e and formidable a Body for their

Country's Defence, as <HI>Great Britain,</HI> or <HI>Swit|zerland,</HI> or any Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> are able to produce.</P>
<P>"In the Year 1701, &s;ome Gentlemen of <HI>Edin|burgh</HI> fir&s;t con&s;idered of proper Methods for civilizing and reforming them; and agreed, that the &s;etting up of Schools in different and con|venient Places, for the in&s;tructing of their Youth in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, and Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and di&s;po&s;ing them to Virtue and Indu&s;try, would be the mo&s;t likely and effectual Means. They joined in a voluntary Sub&s;cription among them&s;elves, and engaged as many others in it as they could, which laid the fir&s;t Foundation of this great and publick De&s;ign. They &s;oon found the Work too heavy a Burden for a few private Hands, and made Application to her late Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> who was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to approve and recommend the &s;ame by her Royal Proclamation, in the Year 1708: and in 1709. granted her Letters Patent, con&s;tituting and appointing a certain Number of the Sub|&s;cribers to be a Society, or Body Politick, by the Name of, <HI>The Society in</HI> Scotland <HI>for propagating Chri&s;tian Knowledge in the Highlands, and I&s;lands, &amp;c.</HI> with full Powers to receive Donations of Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to purcha&s;e Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not ex|ceeding 2000<HI>l.</HI> a Year; and with the Profits and yearly Intere&s;t of the &s;ame to erect and maintain Schools, with many other Privileges and Regula|tions. The Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, or Judges in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> according to her Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ion, nominated 82 Sub&s;cribers to be the fir&s;t Members of the Society, all of them Per&s;ons of the be&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Characters; who at their fir&s;t General Meeting cho&s;e a Pre&s;ident, a Trea|&s;urer, a Secretary, and other Officers. They al&s;o cho&s;e a Committee of Fifteen, who meet every
<PB N="240" REF="241">
Month, or oftener, as they have Occa&s;ion. There is a General Meeting of the whole Society every three Months, when they a&s;&s;ume new Members, make general Regulations, give Orders to the Committee, and receive their Accounts. All Proceedings, both of the Committee, and of the General Meeting, are recorded in di&s;tinct Books, which are always open to the Examination of every Contributor. The Names of the Con|tributors are kept in a di&s;tinct Regi&s;ter with an Account of the &s;everal Benefactions.</P>
<P>"In the Year 1710. they began to &s;ettle Schools in &s;uch Places as had never been reformed from Heatheni&s;m: And their capital Stock having yearly increa&s;ed by the liberal Contributions of many Per&s;ons of all Ranks in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and amounting to above 10000<HI>l.</HI> mo&s;t of which is laid out upon good Security, they have increa&s;ed their Schools in Proportion. Their Number at pre&s;ent is about 100, where above 4000 are taught <HI>gratis,</HI> to read, write, Arithmetick, and P&s;almody. Many of the poorer Scholars have a weekly Al|lowance for their Maintenance, and Cloaths and Books provided for them. Great Care is taken, that the School-ma&s;ters are Men of Probity, Ca|pacity, and well affected to the Government; and they are obliged, be&s;ides the teaching the Children in the Schools, to in&s;truct tho&s;e in the Principles of Religion who are too old to come to School, and at too great a Di&s;tance from the Pari&s;h Church. Many Popi&s;h Parents have at length permitted their Children to be in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>"This Society has appointed Per&s;ons of Cha|racter and Con&s;ideration to be Vi&s;itors of their Schools, and to examine the Conduct and Dili|gence of the School-ma&s;ters, and the Proficiency of the Scholars, and to tran&s;mit Accounts to them at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> All po&s;&s;ible Care is taken to
<PB N="241" REF="242">
manage the Money to the be&s;t Advantage, not a Farthing being diverted to any other Purpo&s;e; and all the principal Officers of the Society &s;erve <HI>gratis.</HI> The Succe&s;s of the Undertaking has an&s;wered all the Pains and Expence of the Society: There appears a great Di&s;po&s;ition in the ri&s;ing Generation to be in&s;tructed; many have learned to read the Scriptures, and attend Divine Service in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> where formerly the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Tongue was only under&s;tood. Several of the Scholars are ca|pable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Ma&s;ters; and &s;ome of them of being Ma&s;ters of the Society's Schools. Many of them have attained to &s;uch Degrees of Know|ledge, as to be admitted to the Celebration of the Lord's Supper. The Face of Reformation and Virtue begins to appear every-where; and there is Rea&s;on to apprehend, that in a few Years, Ig|norance, Popery, and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Language, will be utterly extirpated; and in their &s;tead, Virtue, Loyalty, and Indu&s;try, will take Place.</P>
<P>"Neverthele&s;s, the pre&s;ent Fund is far from be|ing &s;ufficient to the Va&s;tne&s;s of the De&s;ign, as appears from the Report of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed by his late Maje&s;ty King <HI>George, Anno</HI> 1716, to inquire into the State of the <HI>Highlands</HI> and I&s;lands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in pur&s;uance of an Act of Parliament of the preceding Se&s;&s;ion, who gave it as their Opinion, That no Method was &s;o likely to reduce the&s;e Countries to a State of Peace among them&s;elves, and hearty Subjection to the pre&s;ent Government, as that of e&s;tabli&s;h|ing Schools among them; and that over and above the pre&s;ent Number, one hundred and fifty more were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to render the De&s;ign fully effectual.</P>
<P>"This Report had &s;o good an Effect, that it was enacted, (<HI>Anno</HI> 4 <HI>Georgii</HI>) in the Act for ve&s;ting the forfeited E&s;tates in Tru&s;tees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'That a
<PB N="242" REF="243">
Sum not exceeding 20000<HI>l.</HI> &s;hall be appropriated towards making a capital Stock, for a yearly In|tere&s;t or Income, out of the Moneys which &s;hall ari&s;e by Sale of the &s;aid E&s;tates which are in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> towards erecting and maintaining Schools in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> &amp;c. And in the Act (6 <HI>Georgii</HI>) for laying a Duty on wrought Plate, there is a Pro|vi&s;o, That nothing therein &s;hall invalidate the &s;aid Provi&s;ion for Schools in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> &amp;c. But notwith&s;tanding this charitable Provi&s;ion of the Legi&s;lature, 'tis much to be lamented, that neither that Country, nor this Society, ever reaped any Benefit by it, the Produce of the &s;aid E&s;tates having been applied to other Purpo&s;es; whereby the reforming and civilizing of that Country is left to depend very much on private Contribution.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t not forget to ob&s;erve, That the Society's Charter extends to Popi&s;h and Infidel Countries beyond the Seas, and that four Mi&s;&s;ionaries are maintained for converting the native <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America</HI> to the Chri&s;tian Faith; three of which are &s;tationed on the Frontiers of <HI>New England,</HI> between our Settlements and tho&s;e of <HI>French Canada,</HI> by which Means the <HI>Indians</HI> in tho&s;e Parts will more ea&s;ily be kept in Subjection to our Government. The Charge of the&s;e three is in a great mea&s;ure defrayed out of an E&s;tate left to the Society by a late worthy Clergyman in <HI>England</HI> for that Purpo&s;e. The other Mi&s;&s;ionary is in|tirely &s;upported at the Society's Charge in the new Colony of <HI>Georgia</HI>; where &s;everal of the poorer People are gone to re&s;ide.</P>
<P>"And to render this De&s;ign more fully a national Benefit, his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, from an earne&s;t De&s;ire to promote the Good of his Subjects in all Parts of his Dominions, was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, in the Year 1738, to grant his Royal additional
<PB N="243" REF="244">
Charter, to cau&s;e &s;uch Children as they &s;hould find proper, to be in&s;tructed in Hu&s;bandry, Hou&s;e|wifry, and Manufactures. The Society is taking all proper Mea&s;ures for erecting Working-&s;chools; and have good Encouragement to hope, that the landed Gentlemen in the <HI>Highlands</HI> and I&s;les will not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be outdone by their Prote&s;tant Neighbours in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who took the fir&s;t Hint from their De&s;ign; but will, like them, let out and make Grants of &s;mall Parcels of Ground to build their Schools, and for Kitchen-gardens and Agriculture; and for the rai&s;ing of Hemp and Flax for the Linen Manufacture, which is now &s;o greatly improved in that Country. This is the di&s;tinct State of the Ca&s;e, in all the Cir|cum&s;tances and Steps of it.</P>
<P>"As this Undertaking is not the Work of a Party or Faction, but the common Cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, and an Attempt to civilize va&s;t Numbers of People, near half a Million, and make them u&s;eful to Society, who have been in a great mea&s;ure u&s;ele&s;s, and in &s;ome Circum|&s;tances very hurtful to it; 'tis apprehended, That the Wealthy and Well-di&s;po&s;ed, who have an hearty Zeal for the Honour of God, and the Good of the Souls of Men, a true Love for their Country, and the publick Welfare, or a due Concern for the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the pre|&s;ent happy E&s;tabli&s;hment, cannot ea&s;ily find any In&s;tance of U&s;efulne&s;s more likely to turn to Account, or capable of an&s;wering more noble and exten&s;ive Purpo&s;es of Good."</P></Q></P>

<P>_I SHALL now pre&s;ent you with as brief and accurate an Account as I can give you of the I&s;lands of mo&s;t con&s;iderable Note, lying adjacent, or belonging to this Northern Part of the I&s;land of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> beginning, fir&s;t, with</P>

<P>THe&s;e I&s;lands lie in the <HI>Deucaledonian</HI> Sea, and were called, by &s;ome, <HI>Hebrides.</HI> The mo&s;t Southern of them is the <HI>I&s;le of</HI> MAN, which for &s;everal Generations has belonged to Families, who have been Homagers to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> for it: Wherefore I &s;hall pa&s;s it by with the&s;e Re|marks, That when it became intirely &s;ubject to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> it kept a di&s;tinct Bi&s;hop of its own, who&s;e Succe&s;&s;ors continued the Title of <HI>Epi&s;copi Sodoren&s;es,</HI> as well as added that of <HI>Mannen&s;es,</HI> as if they had been Bi&s;hops of the <HI>I&s;les</HI> al&s;o, who&s;e Cathedral was at <HI>Sodor</HI>; and as many of the Towns therein are called by <HI>Scots</HI> Names, &s;o at pre&s;ent it belongs to a <HI>Scots</HI> Peer, <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Athol,</HI> who lately &s;uc|ceeded to this I&s;le, as Heir at Law to his Cou&s;in <HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>Derby.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="255">The I&s;les of BUTE and ARRAN I have already mentioned.</P>
<P>AILSA, or <HI>I&s;le&s;ay,</HI> in the Mouth of the <HI>Clyde,</HI> is a &s;teep Rock, &s;omething re&s;embling the <HI>Ba&s;s</HI> in the Mouth of <HI>Forth,</HI> being inacce&s;&s;ible in all Places, but only by one Pa&s;s, and not inhabited, except at one time of the Year, when a great Fleet of Ve&s;&s;els come thither to fi&s;h for Cod. It abounds with Va|riety of Sea-fowl, e&s;pecially <HI>Solan</HI> Gee&s;e, and has Multitudes of Rabbets. It belongs to the Earl of <HI>Ca&s;&s;il,</HI> who receives, by the Produce of Hogs, Fowl, Down, and Fi&s;h, about 100 Marks <HI>Scots</HI> yearly from hence.</P>
<P>Near the I&s;le of <HI>Bute</HI> lie two I&s;lands, called CUMBRA, the <HI>Greater</HI> and <HI>Le&s;&s;er</HI>; the fir&s;t is about a Mile in length, has a Church in it, and a Well, the Waters of which are reckoned, by the Natives, good again&s;t all Di&s;ea&s;es: The other I&s;land is le&s;s, and both belong to <HI>Montgomery</HI> of <HI>Skelmerly</HI>; the larger is fruitful in Corn, and the &s;maller abounds with Deer.</P>
<P>Near the I&s;le of <HI>Arran,</HI> is FLADA, a &s;mall I&s;land, which abounds with Rabbets.</P>
<P>South-we&s;t from <HI>Bute</HI> lies MERNOCK, about a Mile long, and half a Mile broad, fruitful in Corn.</P>
<P>About a Mile from the Promontory of <HI>Kintyre</HI> lies AVONA, which &s;ignifies, <HI>a good Harbour.</HI> The <HI>Danes</HI> came hither with their Fleets, when they were Ma&s;ters of the I&s;les.</P>
<P>The next remarkable I&s;land is GIGAIA, four Miles from <HI>Kintyre,</HI> &s;ix Miles in Length, and a Mile and a half in Breadth. The Inhabitants are Prote&s;tants. There is a Church in this I&s;land, and a Sepulchre for the <HI>Macneils,</HI> the Proprietors of it. <HI>Corkir,</HI> which dyes a Crim&s;on Colour, and <HI>Cro&s;til,</HI> which dyes a Philamote, grow upon the Stones here. The Soil is good for Pa&s;ture and Arable. They have al&s;o a Medicinal Well, which they e&s;teem a Catholicon.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="256">A Quarter of a Mile South lies CARY, about a Mile in Compa&s;s, has good Pa&s;turage, and abounds with Rabbets. It belongs to the Family of <HI>Mac|ali&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>JURA lies twelve Miles from <HI>Gigaia,</HI> is 20 Miles long, and &s;ix or &s;even broad; it belongs to the Duke of <HI>Argyll,</HI> and makes Part of the Shire of that Name. This is very barren, but reckoned one of the whol|&s;ome&s;t Places in <HI>Scotland:</HI> Here Women &s;eldom die in Child-bed; and one <HI>Macrain</HI> died in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. who had been 180 <HI>Chri&s;tmas's</HI> in one Hou&s;e. It abounds with many Deer, has good Pa&s;turage for other Cattle, has many good Springs, and one again&s;t Nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s of the Stomach and Stone. Here are two very high Mountains, called <HI>The Paps of</HI> JURA; which are noted Sea-marks for a very great Way. From <HI>March</HI> to <HI>September</HI> the Air is perfectly pure. There are very good Salmon in the Rivers of this I&s;land. They have one Church here, called <HI>Killearn.</HI> The Inhabitants, who &s;peak <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and wear the Plaid and Bonnet, are Pro|te&s;tants.</P>
<P>Two Miles from <HI>Jura</HI> lies SCARBA, four Miles long, and one broad; noted for its extraordinary Tides, and the Longevity of its Inhabitants; one of whom, a Woman, lived 140 Years.</P>
<P>Near to the&s;e lie many I&s;lands of le&s;s Note, which I have not room to name. LISMORE, or <HI>Le&s;&s;imore,</HI> the Seat of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Argyll,</HI> who from thence was called <HI>Epi&s;copus Li&s;moren&s;is,</HI> is about eight Miles long, and two broad, and lies Ea&s;tward from <HI>Mull</HI> in the Mouth of <HI>Lock-yol,</HI> which goes up to <HI>Inner|lochy</HI> in <HI>Lochaber.</HI></P>
<P>BERNERA, formerly a Sanctuary in Popi&s;h Times, has a noble Wood of Yew. In this I&s;le, which is five Miles in Circumference, and lies about two Leagues to the South of <HI>Harries,</HI> were, as Mr. <HI>To|land</HI> relates, two Ravens, which beat off all Birds
<PB N="256" REF="257">
of Prey; and when their Young are able to fly abroad, they expel them al&s;o out of the I&s;land; but not without many Blows, and a great Noi&s;e. In this I&s;land, moreover, there is a fre&s;h-water Lake, called <HI>Lochbrui&s;t,</HI> where many Land and Sea|fowl build. There were, according to the &s;ame Au|thor, a couple of Ravens like the former in a &s;mall I&s;le near <HI>North-Vi&s;t</HI>; as al&s;o upon the I&s;le of <HI>Troda</HI> near <HI>Skye.</HI></P>
<P>South-we&s;t from <HI>Jura</HI> lies ILA, 24 Miles long, in &s;ome Places eight, and in others &s;ixteen broad; it abounds with Corn and Cattle, has Store of Deer and Lead Mines, with Lime-&s;tone in va&s;t Quantities. It has &s;everal Rivers, that abound with Salmon, and other Fi&s;h of &s;everal Sorts. In the Centre of it lies <HI>Lochfinlagan,</HI> three Miles in Circumference. It abounds with Salmon, Trouts, and Eels, and has an I&s;land in it, where <HI>Macdonald,</HI> King of the I&s;les, had his Re&s;idence, and made it the Seat of his Go|vernment: The Ruins of who&s;e Court are &s;till to be &s;een here. There are &s;everal fre&s;h-water Lakes in this I&s;land, with Forts upon them. It has al&s;o a Medicinal Well, much frequented by the Natives for all Di&s;ea&s;es. There are &s;everal Caves here, one of them capable of holding 200 Men. The Country is indifferently fruitful. It lies lower than <HI>Jura</HI>; con&s;equently is wetter and le&s;s whol&s;ome. The In|habitants are Prote&s;tants. There are four Churches and a Chapel in this I&s;land, the mo&s;t remarkable of which is St. <HI>Columbus</HI>'s Church. It gives the Title of Earl to a Son of the Family of <HI>Argyll</HI>; but <HI>Campbel</HI> of <HI>Calder</HI> is the chief Proprietor, and al&s;o Steward of the Crown here.</P>

<P>Farther We&s;t lies the &s;mall I&s;le of DOWHIRTA. The Natives have a Tradition that <HI>Pygmies</HI> once lived here. The Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI> is Proprietor.</P>
<P>North-ea&s;t from <HI>Ila</HI> lies the I&s;le of MULL, 24 Miles in Length, and near as much in Breadth: It lies in the Shire of <HI>Argyll.</HI> The Air is temperate, cold, and moi&s;t, but qualified by fre&s;h Breezes from the Mountains. The Natives, when the Sea&s;on is moi&s;t, take a large Do&s;e of <HI>Aquavitae</HI> for a Cor|rective, and chew a Piece of Charmel Root when they intend to be merry, to prevent Drukenne&s;s. This I&s;land in general affords good Pa&s;turage for Cat|tle of all Sorts. They have a great many Deer, and abound with Wild-fowl, and very fine Hawks. Their Hor&s;es are little, but very &s;prightly; their Black Cattle excellent Meat. Their Corn is Barley and Oats. It formerly abounded with Wood, but mo&s;t of it is now cut. The Heaths, be&s;ides Pa&s;turage for Cattle, afford good Fuel for the Natives. The Bay of <HI>Duart,</HI> on the We&s;t-&s;ide, is a good Anchor|ing-place. Upon this &s;tands the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Duart,</HI> the Seat of the Head of the antient Family of <HI>Maclean,</HI> who were the chief Proprietors of this I&s;land; but Sir <HI>John Maclean</HI> having forfeited, it is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Duke of <HI>Argyll.</HI> There are two other Ca&s;tles, and &s;everal Anchoring-places about this I&s;land.

<P>Near this lies the I&s;land of ST.

<P>Six Miles We&s;t from this I&s;land lies TYRE-TY, eight Miles long, and three broad; it is reckoned to be the mo&s;t plentiful of all the I&s;lands in Nece&s;&s;aries of human Life, abounding with Corn, Cattle, Fi&s;h, and Fowl. Here is a fre&s;h-water Lake, with an I&s;land and an old Ca&s;tle in it, and an Harbour for Long-boats, which are u&s;ed in that Country. It formerly belonged to the Family of <HI>Maclean,</HI> but now to the Duke of <HI>Argyll.</HI> There is one Church in this I&s;land, called <HI>Sorabi,</HI> whereof the Dean of the <HI>I&s;les</HI> was Mini&s;ter. The People are Prote&s;tants: they are not very healthy, as the Country lies low.</P>
<P>Near this are two I&s;lands, called KERNIBERG, &s;o &s;trong by Nature, that a little Art would make them impregnable.</P>
<P>About half a League to the North-ea&s;t lies the I&s;land of COLL, ten Miles long, and two broad, and is very fruitful: It has &s;everal Rivulets, which afford Salmon, and a fre&s;h-water Lake, that has Trouts and Eels. The Proprietor is a Branch of the Family of <HI>Maclean.</HI> The Inhabitants are Pro|te&s;tants. They have a Notion here, that <HI>Tyre-ty</HI>
<PB N="260" REF="261">
breeds more Women than Men, and <HI>Coll</HI> more Men than Women; &s;o that they may people each other without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Neighbours. The Coa&s;ts of this I&s;land abound with larger Cod and Ling, than are to be found on the Coa&s;ts of the neighbouring I&s;les and Continent.</P>
<P>North from this lies the I&s;le of RUM, &s;ix Miles long, and four broad: It is mountainous and heathy, but the Coa&s;t is arable and fruitful: It is but thinly inhabited, and the Sea Fowl lay their Eggs in &s;uch Quantities, that in the Spring any one may gather what Number he plea&s;es. The Rivulets of this I&s;land afford Salmon, and there is plenty of Land and Sea Fowl, e&s;pecially tho&s;e called <HI>Puffins:</HI> There are al&s;o abundance of Deer in the Mountains. The Proprietor is <HI>Maclean</HI> of <HI>Coll,</HI> and the Inhabitants are Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>Half a Mile from <HI>Rum</HI> lies CANNEY, two Miles long, and one Mile broad, &s;urrounded with an high Rock, but plentiful in Corn and Gra&s;s, and the Coa&s;ts abound with Cod and Ling. In the North-end there is a Rock of Load&s;tone, as &s;ome think, becau&s;e it di&s;orders the Needle of the Compa&s;s, when any Ships come near it.

<P>EGG lies not far from <HI>Coll,</HI> is three Miles in Length, and a Mile and a half in Breadth, and the Whole pretty good for Pa&s;turage and Cultiva|tion. On the South-end of it is a Mountain, and on the Top of that a high Rock, of about 150 Paces in Circumference, with a fre&s;h-water Pool in the Middle of it; there is only one Pa&s;s up to it, &s;o that it is a natural Fort. On the South-we&s;t Side
<PB N="261" REF="262">
of the I&s;le is a Cave, capable of containing &s;ome Hundreds of People, and there are &s;everal Medi|cinal Wells in this I&s;land. The Proprietors are &s;ome of the <HI>Macdonalds:</HI> the Inhabitants bigotted Papi&s;ts.</P>
<P>North from this lies SKYE, 42 Miles long, and in &s;ome Places 20, in others 30 Miles broad. It is &s;eparated from the Shire of <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> to which it belongs, by a Firth &s;o narrow, that a Man may ea&s;ily call from one Side to the other. It is navi|gable by the large&s;t Ships of War. The Current there is &s;o violent, that no Ve&s;&s;el is able to &s;ail again&s;t it, tho' the Wind prove ever &s;o fair, &s;o that the Tide mu&s;t always be ob&s;erved. The way of Ferrying Cows in the narrow Ferry, called the <HI>Kyle,</HI> where the Tide is very rapid, is thus: They tie a Withe about the Cow's Lower-jaw, and bind five of them together; after which, a Man in the End of a Boat holds the Withe that ties the foremo&s;t, and rows over, carrying in the Space of a few Hours, at Low-water, three or four Hundred Cows. The Country is populous, the People hand&s;ome, and very healthy. Almo&s;t all the Inhabitants of <HI>Skye</HI> are Prote&s;tants. None of them po&s;&s;e&s;s any Land. It is very high Ground, as well on the Coa&s;t as up in the Country, where there are &s;even lofty Mountains, which lie near one another, almo&s;t in the Centre of the I&s;land. It has a great deal of arable Land, which yields a good Increa&s;e; &s;o that they &s;upply the neighbouring Continent with Barley and Oats. It has many excellent Bays and Harbours for the Con|veniency of Fi&s;hing, and other Trade, and about 30 Rivers, which afford Salmon.</P>
<P>ST. COLUMBUS's Lake has an I&s;land and a Chapel in it. Mo&s;t of the Bays abound with Herrings all the Summer; the Natives dry, and pre&s;erve them without Salt for eight Months, without any other Art than taking out their Guts, tying a Ru&s;h about
<PB N="262" REF="263">
their Necks, and hanging them up by Pairs upon a Rope of Heath acro&s;s the Hou&s;e. Cod, Ling, Mackrel, Haddock, Whiting, Turbet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> abound on this Coa&s;t, as do Oy&s;ters, and all other Sorts of Shell-fi&s;h. There are many large Caves in this I&s;land, from the Roof of &s;ome of which there drops a Water, which petrifies into a white limy Sub|&s;tance; one of them in <HI>Slate,</HI> called the <HI>Golden Cave,</HI> is &s;aid to be &s;even Miles long. There are abundance of old Forts on the Coa&s;t, which &s;eem to have been erected by the <HI>Danes</HI>; they &s;tand on ri&s;ing Grounds, and &s;o near one another, that by a Beacon fired on any one of them, the Notice of any approaching Danger by Inva&s;ion was imme|diately &s;pread thro' the whole I&s;land. There are al&s;o &s;everal little Hou&s;es of Stone built under Ground, for hiding People and their Goods in time of War; and others above Ground capable only of holding one Per&s;on, which &s;eem to have been de&s;igned for Con|templation. There are &s;everal of the <HI>Druids</HI> Hou&s;es yet intire in the I&s;le of <HI>Skye,</HI> and in &s;ome other I&s;les. The Vulgar in the I&s;lands &s;till &s;hew a great Re&s;pect for the&s;e Hou&s;es, and never come to the ancient &s;acri|ficing Carns, but they walk three times round them from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, according to the Cour&s;e of the Sun. The Cattle here are Hor&s;es, Cows, Sheep, Goats, and Hogs; the Cows frequently feed on the Sea-weed, and ob&s;erve the Tide of Ebb for that End, as exactly as any Man can do. This I&s;land abounds with Land and Water-fowl of many Sorts, and among others they have Hawks and Eagles. It belongs to Sir <HI>Alexander Macdonald,</HI> &s;ome of who&s;e Ance&s;tors were called Kings of the <HI>I&s;les</HI>; the middle Parts belong to <HI>Mackinnon</HI> of that Ilk, and the North-we&s;t Parts belong to <HI>Macleod</HI>; all three Chiefs of their &s;everal Clans.</P>

<P>On the North-&s;ide of <HI>Skye</HI> lies SCALPA, five Miles in Circumference: It has Wood in &s;everal Parts of it, and is fruitful in Corn and Gra&s;s.</P>
<P>A little farther North lies RAARSAY, &s;even Miles long, and three broad; it has much Wood, and is fitter for Pa&s;ture than Cultivation. On the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of it is a Spring, which runs down from a Rock, and petrifies into a fine white Lime, of which it yields great Quantities. Here is al&s;o a Quarry of good Stone. On the We&s;t-&s;ide are abundance of Caves, where People lodge who go thither in the Summer upon the Account of Fi&s;hing, or Grazing of Cattle. There are &s;everal Forts in this I&s;land, &s;ome of which are naturally very &s;trong. The Proprietor is a Cadet of the Family of <HI>Macleod,</HI> and is as much re&s;pected by the Inhabitants, as if he were a Prince.</P>
<P>A Quarter of a Mile farther North lies RONA, three Miles in Length: 'Tis fruitful in Pa&s;turage, and the Rocks about it are of Hectick Stone.</P>
<P>ALSVIG lies on the South-we&s;t Corner of <HI>Skye,</HI> is two Miles in Circumference, fruitful in Corn and Gra&s;s, and noted for the va&s;t Shoals of Herrings about it, which &s;ometimes entangle the Fi&s;hing-boats.</P>
<P>FLADDA, two Leagues di&s;tant, is but two Miles in Compa&s;s, but much noted for its Fi&s;hing of all Sorts, and for big Whales, which pur&s;ue the Fi&s;h on the Coa&s;t of it. The Sea Fowl called <HI>Coulternebs,</HI> are very numerous here, and a great Flock of Plovers come hither from <HI>Skye,</HI> in the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> and return again in <HI>April.</HI> There are &s;everal Rocks about this I&s;land, particularly one, called <HI>The round Table,</HI> about half a Mile in Cir|cumference, with a fre&s;h-water Spring, which makes
<PB N="264" REF="265">
an impregnable Fort, there being only one Way to climb up to it, by one Man at a time. The Na|tives of <HI>Skye,</HI> and the neighbouring I&s;lands have a peculiar way of curing the Di&s;tempers which are incident to them, by Simples of their own Product, wherein they are &s;ucce&s;sful to a Miracle: They have al&s;o &s;everal Medicinal Wells; but I have not room to in&s;i&s;t upon the&s;e things.</P>
<P>Eighty Miles We&s;t from <HI>Skye</HI> lie nine I&s;lands, the chief of which is VATERSA, which be&s;ide many other Conveniences, has a large Harbour, capable of the greate&s;t Ships, where at &s;tated times great Numbers of Fi&s;hermen meet from the neighbouring Countries.</P>
<P>Two Miles from <HI>Vater&s;a</HI> lies BARRA, &s;even Miles long, and three broad, called &s;o from St. <HI>Bar,</HI> the tutelar Saint: It is fruitful in Corn, and noted for its Cod-fi&s;hing. The Sea enters this I&s;land at a &s;mall Chanel, and afterwards inlarges it&s;elf into a round Bay, in which is an I&s;land, with a very &s;trong Ca&s;tle. It has a good Harbour on the North-ea&s;t Side, where is Plenty of Fi&s;h; and the Rivulets on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide abound with Salmon.</P>
<P>About a Quarter of a Mile South from <HI>Barra</HI> lies KISMUL, the Seat of <HI>Macneil</HI> of <HI>Barra,</HI> which is encompa&s;&s;ed with a Stone Wall two Stories high; within which there is a Tower, a Hall, a Magazine, and other Hou&s;es. They have a Church in this I&s;land, and a Chapel, where the <HI>Macneils</HI> are buried. The Natives are Papi&s;ts, and generally very ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious.</P>
<P>Here are &s;everal other le&s;s I&s;lands belonging to <HI>Macneil,</HI> &s;ome of them fruitful enough in Corn and Gra&s;s, others left for Pa&s;turage, and &s;ome of them remarkable for fi&s;hing of Ling and Cod. The Inhabitants are very healthful and ho&s;pitable: they have abundance of Sea-fowl, and when they kill any of them for U&s;e, they &s;alt them with the
<PB N="265" REF="266">
A&s;hes of burnt Sea-ware, which pre&s;erves them from Putrefaction. <HI>Macneil</HI> holds his Lands of Sir <HI>Alexander Macdonald</HI> of <HI>Slate,</HI> to whom he pays 40<HI>l.

<P>Betwixt <HI>Barra</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;t</HI> lie fourteen &s;mall I&s;lands, not very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>A little North of <HI>Barra</HI> lies SOUTH-VIST, 21 Miles long, in &s;ome Places three, and in others four Miles broad. The Ea&s;t-&s;ide is mountainous, but the We&s;t plain and arable. The I&s;land abounds with fre&s;h-water Lakes, which have plenty of Fowl and Fi&s;h, parti|cularly Trouts and Eels. In &s;everal of them are I&s;lands with Forts. There is one Lake three Miles long, into which the Sea has made its way, tho' the People did all they could to hinder it. The Inhabit|ants are healthy. One Man lately lived 130 Years, and retained his Under&s;tanding. The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Tongue is here &s;poken in great Perfection. The <HI>Macdonalds,</HI> de&s;cended from the antient Kings of the&s;e I&s;lands, are Proprietors, and with the Inhabitants profe&s;s the Popi&s;h Religion. The Soil is generally &s;andy, but yields a good Produce of Barley, Oats, and Rye. Ambergris is &s;ometimes found upon the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Betwixt this I&s;land and <HI>North-vi&s;t,</HI> two Miles North, lies BENBECULA: The Ground is all plain and &s;andy betwixt them, except two little Chanels about Knee-deep at a Tide of Ebb; but the Whole is navigable by Boats at a Tide of Flood, and there lie &s;everal &s;mall I&s;lands on the Ea&s;t of the&s;e Chanels. <HI>Benbecula</HI> is three Miles long, and three broad: it has a Bay on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide for &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, where Her|rings are &s;ometimes taken. The Ea&s;t Part of this I&s;land is arable; it has &s;everal fre&s;h-water Lakes well &s;tored with Fi&s;h and Fowl, and &s;ome &s;mall Forts upon the I&s;lands in tho&s;e Lakes.

The Grain here is Barley, Oats, and Rye, which yields from ten to thirty-fold; and there is no doubt, but Wheat would grow here very well. This I&s;land has &s;everal Bays on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, where Ships may ride; the chief of which are <HI>Loch-eport, Loch-rona,</HI> and <HI>Loch-maddes</HI>; the latter is capable of Hundreds of Ve&s;&s;els of the greate&s;t Size: 400 Ve&s;&s;els have been loaden with Herrings there in a Sea&s;on.

The Inhabitants of <HI>South</HI> and <HI>North-vi&s;t</HI> are generally well proportioned and healthful, and many of them live to a great Age; they are very ho&s;pitable and kind to Strangers.</P>
<P>The I&s;le of LEWES derives its Name from the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Leog,</HI> &s;ignifying <HI>a Lake,</HI> with which this I&s;land abounds; it is by the I&s;landers commonly called the <HI>Long I&s;land:</HI> it is near 100 Miles from North to South, and from 13 to 14 in Breadth; it is reckoned part of the Shire of <HI>Ro&s;s</HI>; but the I&s;le of <HI>Lewes,</HI> properly &s;o called, is but 36 Miles in Length, and 10 or 12 broad, belonging to the Earl of <HI>Sea|forth.</HI> It reaches from the North of <HI>Bowling-head</HI> to the South of <HI>Ha&s;&s;ine&s;s.</HI> The Southern Part is named <HI>Harries.</HI> The Air is temperately cold and moi&s;t, and the Natives u&s;e commonly a Do&s;e of <HI>U&s;quebaugh</HI> for a Corrective. The I&s;land is healthful, e&s;pecially in the Middle, from South and North; it is arable on the We&s;t-&s;ide for about 16 Miles on the Coa&s;t, and is likewi&s;e plain and arable in &s;everal Places in the Ea&s;t: It is fruitful in Corn, and yields a good Increa&s;e; their common Grain is Barley, Oats, and Rye; and they have al&s;o Flax and Hemp. There are &s;everal convenient Bays and Harbours here,
<PB N="268" REF="269">
particularly <HI>Loch&s;tornvay,</HI> on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, in the Middle of the I&s;land; the <HI>Birkin I&s;land,</HI> &s;even Miles Southward; <HI>Locheolmkil,</HI> three Miles farther South; <HI>Loch&s;efort</HI> and <HI>Lochcarlvay,</HI> 24 Miles South-we&s;t. This Bay is remarkable for great Numbers of Cod, Ling, and Whales, which frequent it; and all the Bays and Coa&s;ts abound with Cod, Ling, Herring, and all other Sorts of Fi&s;h taken in the We&s;tern Seas, be&s;ides Plenty of Shell-fi&s;h of all Sorts, in &s;uch va&s;t Numbers, that the Inhabitants are not able to con&s;ume them. Coral and Pearl-&s;hells are al&s;o found in the Bays and Coa&s;ts. There are &s;everal extraordinary Springs and Fountains in this I&s;land, and abundance of Caves on the Coa&s;ts, which Ot|ters, Seals, and Fowl frequent in great Numbers. That Obeli&s;k (if I may call it &s;o) in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Barvas</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Lewes,</HI> called <HI>The Thru&s;hel|&s;tone,</HI> is very remarkable; being not only above 20 Feet high, but likewi&s;e almo&s;t as much in Breadth, which no other comes near. The <HI>Dun,</HI> or Fortification built on an Eminence in <HI>St. Kilda,</HI> which is an old Fort, is about 18 Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>North Vi&s;t,</HI> and 20 from the Middle of <HI>Lewes,</HI> or <HI>Harries,</HI> to be &s;een only in a very fair Day, like a bluei&s;h Mi&s;t; but a large Fire there would be vi&s;ible at Night, as the a&s;cending Smoke by Day. In this &s;ame I&s;le (where are many &s;uch <HI>Duns</HI>) North of the Village of <HI>Brago,</HI> is a round Fort compo&s;ed of huge Stones, three Stories high; that is, it has three hollow Pa&s;&s;ages one over another, within a prodigious thick Wall quite round the Fort, with many Windows and Stairs.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o, at the Village of <HI>Cla&s;&s;erni&s;s,</HI> is a Druidical Temple extremely remarkable. The Circle con&s;i&s;ts of 12 Obeli&s;ks, about &s;even Feet high each, and di&s;tant from each other &s;ix Feet. In the Centre &s;tands a Stone 13 Feet high, in the perfect Shape of the Rudder of a Ship. Directly

South from the Circle, &s;tand four Obeli&s;ks running out in a Line, another &s;uch Line due Ea&s;t, and a third to the We&s;t; the Number and Di&s;tances of the Stones being in the&s;e Wings the &s;ame: &s;o that this Temple, the mo&s;t intire that can be, is at the &s;ame time both round and winged. But to the North, reach (by way of Avenue) two &s;trait Ranges of Obeli&s;ks, of the &s;ame Bigne&s;s and Di&s;tances with tho&s;e of the Circle; yet the Ranges them&s;elves are eight Feet di&s;tant, each con&s;i&s;ting of 19 Stones, the 39th being in the Entrance of the Avenue. This Temple &s;tands a&s;tronomically, denoting the 12 Signs of the Zodiack, and the four principal Winds, &s;ub|divided each into four others; by which, and the 19 Stones, on each &s;ide the Avenue, repre&s;enting the Cycle of 19 Years, it appears to have been dedicated principally to the Sun, but &s;ubordinately to the Sea&s;ons, and the Elements; particularly to the Sea, and the Winds, as is manife&s;t by the Rudder in the Middle.</P>
<P>This I&s;land abounds with Cows, Hor&s;es, Sheep, Goats and Hogs; the Black Cattle are &s;mall, but very prolifick, and make excellent Meat; the Hor&s;es are likewi&s;e &s;maller than on the Continent, but as &s;erviceable for all dome&s;tick U&s;es, and live very hard, having little to feed upon in the Spring but Sea-ware. The Inhabitants are well proportioned, and in ge|neral healthful and &s;trong, and of a &s;anguine Com|plexion; they are very quick of Apprehen&s;ion, and Lovers of Poe&s;y and Mu&s;ick: They are dextrous at Swimming, Volting, and Archery, and make &s;tout, able Seamen.</P>
<P>In a little I&s;land near the greater one of <HI>Lewes,</HI> were a couple of Eagles, which would never &s;uffer any other of their Kind to continue in the Place; driving away their own young ones, as &s;oon as they were able to fly. The Natives &s;aid, That tho&s;e Eagles were &s;o careful of their Habitation, that they

never killed any Sheep or Lamb in the I&s;land, tho' the Bones of Lambs, Fawns, and Wild-fowl, were frequently found in and about their Ne&s;ts; &s;o that they made their Purcha&s;e in the oppo&s;ite I&s;lands, the neare&s;t of which is a League di&s;tant.</P>
<P>There are many other le&s;&s;er I&s;lands, which lie round this; the chief of which are, GARVE, in the Mouth of <HI>Lochcarlvay,</HI> a high Rock, half a Mile in Compa&s;s, affording good Pa&s;turage, and naturally a &s;trong Fort: the two BERNERA's, one two Miles, and the other four Miles long, and four Miles broad; both fruitful in Corn and Gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Carlvay Bay</HI> lie four &s;mall I&s;lands, which belong to the Inhabitants of <HI>Lewes,</HI> who go thither every Summer, and bring from thence great Store of Fowls, Eggs, Down, Feathers, and Quills; one of them is called the ISLAND OF PYGMIES, be|cau&s;e many little Bones, re&s;embling tho&s;e of Men, are digged out of the Ground there.</P>
<P>Twenty Leagues from the Point of <HI>Ne&s;&s;e</HI> in <HI>Lewes</HI> lies <HI>Rona,</HI> a Mile long, and half a Mile broad: it has a Hill on the We&s;t Part, which makes it vi&s;ible from <HI>Lewes</HI> in the Summer-time. It was inhabited by about five Families, who had the I&s;land and the Fi&s;hery about it divided among them, and were very exact and nice in their Properties; and when their Number increa&s;ed, the Supernumeraries were &s;ent to their Landlord in <HI>Lewes,</HI> who once a Year &s;ends the Mini&s;ter of his Pari&s;h, and a Servant, to vi&s;it them, and bring his Rents, which are paid in Barley-meal &s;ewed up in Skins, Sea Fowl, and &s;ome Fi&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They have a Chapel dedicated to St. <HI>Ronan,</HI> in which they repeat the Lord's Prayer, Creed, and Ten Commandments every <HI>Lord's-day.

ignorant of Luxury and Avarice, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, thro' their Freedom from Vices, that Innocence and Tranquillity of Mind, which others can &s;carcely attain unto by great Labour, and with the Help of the be&s;t In&s;tructions. Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> affirms, in his <HI>De&s;cription of the We&s;tern I&s;lands,</HI> That antient Race of poor People was all de&s;troyed about 40 Years ago, in the following manner: Fir&s;t, A Swarm of Rats, none knows how, came into the I&s;land, and eat up all their Corn. In the next Place, &s;ome Seamen landed, and robbed them of what Provi&s;ions they had left. By this means they all died before the u&s;ual Time of the Arrival of the Boat from <HI>Lewes</HI>; upon which another Colony was &s;ent thither.</P>
<P>Four Leagues Ea&s;t from <HI>Rona</HI> lies SOULISKER, a Rock, a Quarter of a Mile in Circumference, which abounds with va&s;t Numbers of Sea Fowl, particularly <HI>Solan</HI> Gee&s;e. On this Rock there builds one Fowl not found el&s;ewhere, called <HI>Colk</HI>; it is le&s;s than a Goo&s;e, and all covered with Down, but of different Colours, which it ca&s;ts when it hatches; it has a Tuft on its Head re&s;embling that of a Peacock, and a Train longer than that of a Hou&s;e-cock. There were formerly 24 Churches in <HI>Lewes</HI> and <HI>Harries,</HI> and the I&s;lands belonging to them: but, alas! to our Shame may it be &s;aid, as Papi&s;ts were pro&s;ecuted or di&s;couraged, Profanene&s;s gained Ground of Super&s;tition, and one &s;ort of Ignorance &s;ucceeded another; for few or no Mini&s;ters being &s;ent with &s;uitable Provi&s;ion and Encouragement, Places of religious Wor&s;hip became ruinous, and the Service of God, and the Edification of the People, very much neglected; &s;o that &s;everal Pari&s;hes in the <HI>Highlands</HI> and <HI>I&s;les,</HI> at pre&s;ent, are 20, 30, or near forty Miles long, and very often without any Mini&s;ter at all.</P>
<P>That Part which is called HARRIES, produces the &s;ame Sorts of Corn, but with a greater Increa&s;e than <HI>Lewes.</HI> The We&s;t-&s;ide is for the mo&s;t part arable
<PB N="272" REF="273">
on the Coa&s;t. It has a noble Harbour called <HI>Scalpa,</HI> a Mile and a half long, and a Mile broad; and there are two other Harbours within three Leagues of it, which abound with Oy&s;ters, and other Shell|fi&s;h. They have excellent Springs here, &s;ome of which are Medicinal; one particularly near <HI>Marvag</HI> is excellent for re&s;toring a lo&s;t Appetite, and one near <HI>Borve,</HI> good again&s;t the Colick and Gravel. There are &s;everal Caves on the Mountains, and on each &s;ide of the Coa&s;t, and in the middle of a high Rock, capable of holding 50 Men; has two Wells, and but a narrow Pa&s;s to it by climbing up the Rock; &s;o that in Time of War it is an impregnable Fort. There are likewi&s;e &s;everal antient Forts in this I&s;land. The Hills and Mountains abound with Deer, which none are allowed to hunt without Leave from <HI>Mac|leod,</HI> the Proprietor. <HI>Metricks,</HI> a four-footed Crea|ture, about the Size of a large Cat, are pretty nu|merous here; their Skins are very fine, of a brown Colour, and make good Fur; and 'tis &s;aid, the Dung of this Animal yields a Scent like Mu&s;k. There are abundance of Otters and Seals here, great Plenty of Land and Sea Fowl, and among others, Eagles, and very good Hawks. The Inhabitants both of <HI>Lewes</HI> and <HI>Harries</HI> are Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>There are other I&s;lands of &s;mall Extent belonging to the <HI>Harries,</HI> the chief of which are BERNERA, two Leagues to the South; it is five Miles in Cir|cumference, very fruitful in Barley and Rye, and yields &s;ometimes from 20 to 30 Fold. There are two Chapels in this I&s;land.</P>
<P>Half a League from thence to the We&s;tward lies PABBAY, three Miles in Circumference, and fruit|ful in Corn and Gra&s;s: It has al&s;o two Chapels.</P>
<P>Half a League to the North lies SELLAY, a Mile in Circumference; it yields extraordinary Pa&s;ture for Sheep, which it fattens very &s;oon, and tho&s;e bred there have very large Horns.</P>

<P>Eighteen Leagues We&s;t from <HI>North-vi&s;t,</HI> and 20 from <HI>Harries,</HI> lies the I&s;land called ST. KILDA, or HIRTA; as <HI>This Hirta</HI> is the mo&s;t North-we&s;t, &s;o <HI>Dow Hirta</HI> is the mo&s;t South-we&s;t of all the <HI>Scots</HI> I&s;lands. The fir&s;t, properly called <HI>St. Kilda,</HI> is two Miles long and one broad, faced round with a &s;teep Rock, except at the Bay on the South-ea&s;t, where Ve&s;&s;els enter. The Land ri&s;es high in the Middle, and there are &s;everal Fountains of good Water on each &s;ide the I&s;land. Their Grain is Oats and Bar|ley, the latter accounted the large&s;t in the <HI>We&s;tern I&s;les.</HI> The Inhabitants are about two hundred in Number, very well proportioned and comely. They are Prote&s;tants, and very zealous, according to their Knowledge, which is but &s;mall for want of In|&s;truction. They are very regular and ju&s;t in their Conver&s;ation, and Strangers to Luxury and Exce&s;s, being ignorant of the U&s;e of Money. They have a Chapel, where they a&s;&s;emble on the <HI>Lord's-day,</HI> to hear the Lord's Prayer, Creed, and Ten Com|mandments; and neither work them&s;elves, nor will allow any Stranger to work, on that Day. It be|longs to the Laird of <HI>Macleod,</HI> the Chief of that antient Clan, who commonly makes &s;ome Cadet of his Family Steward of this I&s;land, to receive his Rents, which are paid in Fi&s;h, Fowl, Feathers, Wool, Butter, Chee&s;e, Cattle, and Corn: and the Steward's Deputy is, in his Ab&s;ence, the chief Man of the I&s;land; and generally, except when a Mini&s;ter is &s;ent thither from <HI>Harries,</HI> baptizes and
<PB N="274" REF="275">
marries. They have an Altar and Crucifix in their Chapel, which have continued there &s;ince the Time of Popery; and tho' they pay no Wor&s;hip to the Crucifix, yet they &s;wear deci&s;ive Oaths, by laying their Hands upon it, and take the Marriage Oath in the &s;ame manner. Not long ago an illiterate Fel|low, one of the Natives, impo&s;ed upon their Igno|rance, by pretending that St. <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> and the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> had appeared to him, and taught him Sermons, Prayers, and Hymns: the latter, he alledged, were effectual to &s;ecure Women again&s;t Mi&s;|carriage; and his Price for teaching them was a Sheep. He told them of a little Hill, where St. <HI>John</HI> and the Virgin appeared to him: And made them believe, that if any of their Black Cattle or Sheep came near to ta&s;te the Gra&s;s of that Hill, they mu&s;t immediately be killed and eaten; and it was nece&s;&s;ary, that he him&s;elf &s;hould always partake of the Treat. He was di&s;covered at la&s;t by his lewd Attempts upon &s;everal Women; and being, by <HI>Macleod</HI>'s Order, tran&s;ported from thence to <HI>Harries,</HI> he made publick Confe&s;&s;ion of his Im|po&s;ture in &s;everal Churches, and &s;eemed to be very penitent, but was not allowed to return any more. Their Hou&s;es are low, built of Stone, and a Cement of dry Earth, and covered with Turf, thatched over with Straw. They make their Beds in the Walls of their Hou&s;es, and lie commonly on Straw, tho' they have great Plenty of Feathers and Down. They live all together in a little Village, on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land, in good Harmony; are very exact and nice in their &s;everal Properties, and allow no Encroachment upon one another, nor will they admit of it from their Landlord, or his Steward, but pay exactly what they agree on. The I&s;land is naturally &s;trong, and, with a little Art, might be made impregnable. There is an old Fort at the South-end of the Bay.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="276">In the I&s;land of <HI>St. Kilda</HI> is the Hou&s;e of a Druide&s;s, built all of Stone, without Lime, or Mor|ter, or Earth to cement it; it is al&s;o arched, and of a conick Figure, but open at the Top, and a Fire|place in the Middle of the Floor. It cannot con|tain above nine Per&s;ons, to &s;it ea&s;y by each other. From the Side of the Wall go off three low Vaults, &s;eparated from each other by Pillars, and capable of containing five Per&s;ons apiece.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t &s;uch another Hou&s;e in all re&s;pects, but much larger, and grown over with a green Sod on the Out&s;ide, is in <HI>Borera,</HI> an I&s;le adjacent to <HI>St. Kilda,</HI> which was the Habitation of a Druid.</P>
<P>At the North-end of <HI>St. Kilda,</HI> were a cou|ple of Eagles, who drove away all others of the &s;ame Kind, even their own Progeny; and brought their Prey from other Parts, without plundering the Place of their own Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>They have two other I&s;lands which belong to them, one called SOA, about half a Mile from the We&s;t|&s;ide of <HI>St. Kilda,</HI> a Mile in Circumference, and very high and &s;teep all round.</P>
<P>The other is called BORERA, lies about two Leagues North of <HI>St. Kilda,</HI> is about a Mile in Circumference, and mo&s;t of it &s;urrounded with a high Rock. All three afford good Pa&s;turage, and abound with prodigious Numbers of Sea Fowl from <HI>March</HI> till <HI>September.</HI> They have <HI>Solan</HI> Gee&s;e in &s;uch Numbers, that they keep about 20,000 annually in little Stone Hou&s;es, built on purpo&s;e for them, and for pre&s;erving their other Fowl, Eggs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The latter they pre&s;erve &s;ome Months in the A&s;hes of Peat, and they pre&s;erve their Fowl without Salt: They eat the <HI>Solan</HI> Gee&s;e Eggs raw, and &s;ay they are good Pectorals. They have another Bird here, called <HI>Fulmar,</HI> about the Size of a Moor-hen: it picks its Food out of live Whales, and other Fi&s;hes. When any one approaches them, they &s;pout out
<PB N="276" REF="277">
pure Oil from their Bills, which the Natives have a way to catch, when they &s;urpri&s;e the Fowl; and make u&s;e of it for their Lamps, and likewi&s;e as a Remedy again&s;t Rheumatick Pains, Aches, and other Di&s;tempers. It &s;erves them al&s;o for Vomits and Purges, for Swellings or Strains, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ing of Tumours; in all which Ca&s;es, they &s;ay, it is very &s;ucce&s;sful. Both Sexes have a Genius for Poe&s;y, are very ho&s;pitable to Strangers, and charitable to their own Poor, for who&s;e Maintenance they all contri|bute in Proportion. They have but one Boat be|longing to the I&s;land, in which every Man has a Share proportionable to the Rent he pays. The Men are generally &s;trong, are &s;tout Rowers, and will tug a long time at the Oar without Intermi&s;&s;ion. They u&s;e no Compa&s;s, but take their Mea&s;ure from the Sun, Moon, or Stars, and chiefly from the Cour&s;es of the Flocks of the Sea Fowl, becau&s;e they know very well to what Rocks or I&s;lands they re&s;ort. They are excellent at climbing of Rocks, being accu&s;tomed to it from their Infancy, in order to catch the Fowl which build on them. They have two Ropes, which belong to them in common for climb|ing the Rocks; they are 24 Fathoms in Length each, and covered with Cows Hides &s;alted, to pre|vent their being cut by the Rocks. The Men climb by turns, and bring home &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Eggs and Fowls at a time. They al&s;o make Gins of Hor&s;e-hair, for catching the Fowl; yet &s;ometimes they lo&s;e their Lives by climbing. The riche&s;t Man in the I&s;le has not above eight Cows, eighty Sheep, and two or three Hor&s;es. They have no Money, but barter with one another for what they want.</P>

<P>'Tis certain, &s;ays that Gentleman, no Country abounds more with the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, and at le&s;s Labour or Charge, than the <HI>Hebrides.</HI> In the fir&s;t place, there is known to be, in tho&s;e I&s;lands, a prodigious Plenty of Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h. Their Cattle of all Sorts (as Cows, Sheep, Goats, and Hogs) are exceeding numerous and prolifick; &s;mall indeed of Size, as are likewi&s;e their Hor&s;es, but of a &s;weet and delicious Ta&s;te. So are their Deer, which freely range in Herds on the Mountains. No Place can

compare with this for tame and wild Fowl, there being of the latter no-where in the World a greater Diver&s;ity, many Sorts of them extremely beautiful, and rare, or utterly unknown, el&s;ewhere. The like may be &s;aid of their various amphibious Animals. Numberle&s;s are their Fountains and Springs, Rivulets, Rivers and Lakes, very whol&s;ome in their Waters, and every-where &s;uperabounding with Fi&s;h, e&s;peci|ally the mo&s;t delicate, as Trout and Salmon: nor is it by Herrings alone that all <HI>Europe</HI> knows no Seas to be better &s;tored, nor with more Kinds, from the Shrimp to the Whale; as no Harbours or Bays are &s;uperior, whether regard be had to Number or Com|modiou&s;ne&s;s. Add to this their Variety of excellent Roots and Plants, particularly tho&s;e of marine Growth, every one of them &s;erving for Food or Phy&s;ick. Their Pa&s;tures are &s;o kindly, that they might live on Milk alone, with that inconceivable Quantity of Eggs they yearly gather off the de&s;ert Rocks and I&s;lets. Bread is plentiful enough. The Ground is generally allow'd to be much richer, than on the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Continent, &s;ome Parts whereof are not &s;eldom &s;upply'd hence with Corn.</P>
<P><HI>Lewes</HI> is very fruitful; and tho' Barley, Oats, and Rye, be the only Grain &s;own there at pre&s;ent, yet the Ground both in that, and mo&s;t of the other I&s;lands, is fit to bear Wheat, and con&s;equently Legumes of all &s;orts. 'Tis truly amazing they have any Crop at all, con&s;idering how un&s;kilful they are in Agriculture, how de&s;titute of the propere&s;t In|&s;truments to till the Ground, and that they &s;carce u&s;e any other Manure but Sea-wreck or Tangles.

of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> who claimed the Sove|reignty; and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, continued po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, till the Marriage of King <HI>James</HI> III. with a Daughter of <HI>Denmark,</HI> when they were fir&s;t mort|gaged for a great Sum, due then by the Contract; and thereafter, upon her bringing forth a Son (after|wards King <HI>James</HI> IV.) the intire Right to them was &s;urrendered to King <HI>James</HI> III. which was far|ther confirmed to King <HI>James</HI> VI. upon his marry|ing <HI>Anne</HI> his Queen, the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Daughter. The Earldom of <HI>Orkney,</HI> and Lord&s;hip of <HI>Zetland,</HI> continued in the Crown, till Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> being to marry <HI>James Hepburn,</HI> Earl of <HI>Bothwell,</HI> by fatal Advice of her Privy Council, advanced him to the Dignity of Duke of <HI>Orkney.</HI> After his Death, King <HI>James</HI> VI. created a natural Son of King <HI>James</HI> V.

But the &s;aid Country, by the Union-Parliament, was di&s;&s;olved from the Crown, and her late Maje&s;ty thereupon granted the &s;ame to the then Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> for Payment of the yearly Sum of 500<HI>l.</HI> and appointed him Steward and Ju&s;ticier within the Bounds thereof. Under the Stewards are &s;ome Judges of his Creation and Appointment, called <HI>Bailiffs:</HI> In every Pari&s;h and I&s;le there is one. Their Office is to over&s;ee the Manners of the Inhabitants, to hold Courts, and to determine in Civil Matters, to the Value of 10<HI>l. Scots</HI> (16<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.

<PB N="292" REF="293">
or his Deputy.

The&s;e <HI>Lawrightmen</HI> have a Privilege inherent to their Office, by the Cu&s;tom of the Country, which is not u&s;ual el&s;e|where; and this is, if there be any Su&s;picion of Theft, they take &s;ome of their Neighbours with them, during the Silence of the Night, and make Search for the Theft, which is called <HI>Ran&s;acking,</HI> from <HI>Ran&s;aka,</HI> which is to make Inquiry, in the antient <HI>Dani&s;h:</HI> they &s;earch every Hou&s;e they come to, and &s;eizing him upon whom the Theft is found, bring him to the Seat of <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian Religion was not only preached, but planted very early in the&s;e I&s;les: for we find <HI>Servanus</HI> (or St. <HI>Serf</HI>) was their Bi&s;hop, and Pre|ceptor to the famous <HI>Kentigern,</HI> (whom, in a familiar way, he called <HI>Mongah,</HI> or <HI>Mungo,</HI> in his vulgar Tongue) who founded the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>St. A&s;aph</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI> about the Year 560. and who had been al&s;o Bi&s;hop of <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI> And, <HI>Anno</HI> 1071. the People of <HI>Orkney</HI> &s;ent one of their Clergy to <HI>York,</HI> with Let|ters, de&s;iring that Archbi&s;hop (who was then, in <HI>Fact,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Juri&s;diction over the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>) to con&s;ecrate him to be their Bi&s;hop. The la&s;t <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hop was <HI>Adam Hepburn,</HI> who con|formed to the Reformation, and lived many Years after it. He was an eminent Man in his Time, a Lord of Council and Se&s;&s;ion; he crowned King
<PB N="293" REF="294">
<HI>James</HI> VI. was Father to the Lord <HI>Holy-rood-hou&s;e,</HI> where he was Abbot, and where his Tomb remains to this Day. The brave Lieutenant General <HI>George Hamilton,</HI> Field Mar&s;hal of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> lately decea&s;ed, was Earl of <HI>Orkney.</HI></P>
<P>Eighty Miles farther North lie the I&s;les of SHET|LAND; betwixt them lies the FAIR ISLE, which ri&s;es up in three high Promontories, and is &s;een both in <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland.</HI> They lie in 61 and 62 Degrees of North Latitude, and have <HI>Norway</HI> on the Ea&s;t, which is the neare&s;t Part of the Continent of <HI>Europe.</HI> There are in all Forty-&s;ix I&s;lands, Forty Holms, or le&s;&s;er I&s;les, left for Pa&s;turage, and Thirty Rocks frequented only by Fowl.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands, called THE MAIN|LAND, is 60 Miles long, and, in &s;ome Places, 16 broad: it runs into the Sea with abundance of Promontories: it is be&s;t inhabited, and cultivated, on the Shore; but the inner Part is mountainous, and full of Lakes or Bogs, which makes travelling there to Strangers dangerous. The Air is cool and piercing; yet many of the Inhabitants live to a great Age. About the Summer Sol&s;tice they have &s;o much Light all Night, that they can &s;ee to read by it. The Sun &s;ets between Ten and Eleven at Night, and ri&s;es between One and Two in the Morning; and, on the other hand, the Day is &s;o much &s;horter, and the Night longer in the Winter; which, with the Violence of the Tides, and the Tempe&s;tuou&s;ne&s;s of the Seas, deprives them of all foreign Corre&s;pondence from <HI>October</HI> to <HI>April,</HI> during which Time they know nothing of what pa&s;&s;es in the other Parts of the World. A known In&s;tance of this was, that tho' the Revolution happened to begin in <HI>November,</HI> they knew nothing of it till the <HI>May</HI> following, when a Fi&s;herman, who arrived there, told them of it; and then they impri&s;oned him, in order to try him for &s;preading &s;uch News.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="295">They are much &s;ubject to the Scurvy, by eating too much Fi&s;h; but Nature has furni&s;hed them with great Quantities of Scurvygra&s;s for an Antidote. They have little Corn of their own Growth, and therefore import great Quantities from <HI>Orkney.</HI> Their common Drink is Whey, which they barrel up, and keep in cold Cellars; this makes it very &s;trong, &s;o that it quickly turns their Heads. Some of them keep for their Drink Butter-milk mixed with Water, and this they call <HI>Bland.</HI> The better Sort have good Beer and Ale, of which they are very liberal to Strangers. They have abundance of the Fi&s;h of all Sorts on their Coa&s;ts for mo&s;t Part of the Year: tho&s;e that abound mo&s;t are Cod, Ling, and Herring. They have al&s;o Shell-fi&s;h of all Sorts, with Whales, Seals, Sea-calves, and Otters; and in the Winter-time they burn Oil of Fi&s;h in&s;tead of Candle. They abound with all Sorts of Fowl, except Heath-cocks; and other Fowls which fre|quent Heaths, will not live there when brought thi|ther, tho' they have abundance of Heath. They have Store of Gee&s;e, and many Sorts of Ducks. They have Plenty of little Hor&s;es, which they call <HI>Schelties,</HI> very fit for the Hu&s;bandman's U&s;e, and pace naturally. They make coar&s;e Cloth, Stockens, and knit Gloves for their own U&s;e, and al&s;o for Sale to the <HI>Norwegians.</HI> Their Grain is Oats and Big, but mo&s;t of the latter. They have abundance of Black Cattle and Sheep. Their Ewes are very pro|lifick, and for the mo&s;t part bring forth two, and &s;ometimes three Lambs at once. Their Fewel is Turf, Peat, and Heath. Their chief Trade of Export con&s;i&s;ts in Fi&s;h, by the Produce of which they pay their Rent, and purcha&s;e Nece&s;&s;aries. Their native Language is old <HI>Gothick,</HI> or <HI>German,</HI> as was al&s;o that of <HI>Orkney</HI>; but they generally now &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> In their Cu&s;toms and Habit they much re&s;emble the <HI>Germans,</HI> but the better Sort
<PB N="295" REF="296">
imitate the <HI>Scots Lowlanders.</HI> Their Religion is Prote&s;tant, and they are generally, as well as the <HI>Orkney-men,</HI> very devout. There were few or no Pre&s;byterians in the&s;e Parts before the Year 1700. when new Mi&s;&s;ionaries came, and ejected the old Clergy; yet the People did not care to hear them, &s;o long as they had any body el&s;e. They make u&s;e of no Phy&s;icians; and if at any time they receive Wounds, they cure them&s;elves. There are two little Towns in this I&s;land; the fir&s;t and olde&s;t is <HI>Scalloway,</HI> on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land, where there is a Ca&s;tle four Stories high: the Inhabitants are about an hundred in Number. The &s;econd and large&s;t is <HI>Lerwick,</HI> which by their Fi&s;hing-trade is increa&s;ed now to about three hundred Families.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal antient Monuments in the&s;e I&s;lands, and particularly tho&s;e called <HI>Picts Hou&s;es,</HI> which we have not room to in&s;i&s;t upon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch, Hamburghers,</HI> &amp;c. come hither to fi&s;h in <HI>June,</HI> and go away again in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> and <HI>September</HI>; and &s;ometimes there are two thou&s;and Bu&s;&s;es fi&s;hing in <HI>Bra&s;&s;a</HI>'s Sound at once.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable of the other I&s;lands here, are, ZEAL, commonly called YELL, eighteen Miles long, and nine broad: it has three Churches, and &s;everal Chapels. And,</P>
<P>Farther North lies VUIST, much of the &s;ame Dimen&s;ions, plain, plea&s;ant to the Eye, fruitful, and well inhabited. It is the plea&s;ante&s;t of the <HI>Shetland</HI> I&s;les, has three Churches, and as many Harbours. The Inhabitants &s;ay, no Cats will live in it.</P>
<P>TRONDA lies over-again&s;t <HI>Scalloway</HI>; it is three Miles long, and two broad.</P>
<P>A little North-ea&s;t lies WALSEY, three Miles long, and as many broad.</P>
<P>On the Ea&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;&s;a</HI>'s Sound lies GREAT RULE, eight Miles long, and two broad: it has a good Harbour.</P>

<P>BURRAY is three Miles long, has good Pa&s;turage, abounds with Fi&s;h on the Coa&s;t, and has a Church in it. No Mice will live here; and, 'tis &s;aid, they for&s;ake the Place, where-ever the Earth of it is brought.</P>
<P><HI>Shetland</HI> is divided into twelve Pari&s;hes; but there are many more Churches and Chapels in it. This Country, like <HI>Orkney,</HI> has no Wood in it; but they have &s;ome Fi&s;h and Fowl peculiar to them|&s;elves.

<P>It has been debated among the Learned, whether the&s;e I&s;lands, the <HI>Orcades,</HI> or the North-ea&s;t Coa&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was the THULE of the Antients; but we have not room to give an Account of the Argu|ments for the &s;everal Hypothe&s;es, nor to con&s;ider which of them are mo&s;t conclu&s;ive; tho' it ought to be ob&s;erved, that Sir <HI>Robert Sibbald</HI> has in a man|ner demon&s;trated, that the North-ea&s;tern Parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> were what the Antients called &s;o. For thus &s;peaks <HI>Claudian,</HI> of <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> Father of the Emperor of that Name:

<P>The chief Families in <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland</HI> are the <HI>Bruces, Sinclairs, Mouats, Nivets, Chyneys, Stuarts, Grahams, Moodies, Dowgla&s;&s;es, Honeymans, Trails, Bakies, Southerlands, Craigies, Youngs, Buchanans, &amp;c.</HI> But the mo&s;t antient, and, I may &s;ay, original, are the <HI>Fletts, Hackrews, Richens, Feas, Skolas, Grottes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the Mouth of the River FORTH lie &s;eve|ral I&s;lands, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which is the MAY: it was formerly dedicated to St. <HI>Adrian,</HI> who was martyred there by the <HI>Danes,</HI> and afterwards a religious Place was built in Memory of him. The Monks gave out, that barren Women, who came thither annually to wor&s;hip at St. <HI>Adrian</HI>'s Shrine, would thereby be cured of their Barrenne&s;s; and it was frequented upon that Account by Women in the Popi&s;h Times. But whether St. <HI>Adrian</HI> or the Monks had the mo&s;t Influence in curing their Bar|renne&s;s, I determine not. Yet that fond, &s;illy Per|&s;ua&s;ion obtained &s;o much Credit, that <HI>Wood,</HI> of <HI>Largo,</HI> who was a noted Sea Captain, had a Charter of &s;everal Lands from King <HI>James</HI> IV. to be in Readine&s;s upon Call to attend his Maje&s;ty and the Queen while they vi&s;ited St. <HI>Adrian.</HI> This I&s;land is a Mile long from North to South, and about a Quarter of a Mile broad: it lies &s;even Miles from
<PB N="298" REF="299">
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Fife,</HI> has a fre&s;h-water Spring, and a &s;mall Lake. There grows no Corn here; but in the Summer it affords Pa&s;turage for an hundred Sheep, and twenty Black Cattle. The We&s;t-&s;ide is inacce&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e of high Rocks; but the Ea&s;t|&s;ide is plain, and has four Places where Boats may arrive, one of them a &s;afe Harbour for Ships during a &s;trong We&s;t Wind. Fi&s;h of all Sorts are numerous on the Coa&s;t of this I&s;land, and it abounds with Fowl, particularly tho&s;e called Skarts, Dunters, Gulls, Scouts, and Kittawaax; the latter is about the Size of a Dove, and in <HI>July</HI> is prefer'd to a Par|tridge. The Scouts are &s;omewhat le&s;s than a Duck, but their Eggs are larger than tho&s;e of a Goo&s;e, and being boiled hard, eat very well with Vinegar and Par&s;ley. This I&s;land of <HI>May</HI> formerly belonged to the Priory of <HI>Pittenweem,</HI> but was granted in Fee by King <HI>Charles</HI> I. to <HI>Cunningham</HI> of <HI>Barns,</HI> with Liberty to build a Light-hou&s;e there for the Benefit of Ships; for the Maintenance of which they were to allow 2<HI>d. per</HI> Tun. A Tower of 40 Foot high is built there for that End, with a Fire every Night; and the fir&s;t Builder was ca&s;t away, in returning from thence to his Hou&s;e in <HI>Fife,</HI> by a Tempe&s;t which &s;ome poor old Women were executed for rai&s;ing.</P>
<P>The BASS lies next; but I have given an Account of it already.</P>
<P>Higher up in the <HI>Forth</HI> lies INCHKEITH, betwixt <HI>Fife</HI> and <HI>Lothian,</HI> a Mile and a half long, and about half a Mile broad: the Soil is fat, and produces good Gra&s;s, and abundance of phy&s;ical Herbs. It has four fre&s;h-water Springs, and as many Harbours, one towards each Quarter: it ri&s;es in the Middle, and has a &s;trong Stone Fort rai&s;ed upon it by Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> There is a Stone Quarry here, which &s;ends forth a &s;trong &s;ulphurous Smell, when any Pieces are broken off, but very fit for Building. There are
<PB N="299" REF="300">
great Shoals of Fi&s;h round the Coa&s;ts of this I&s;land, and abundance of Oy&s;ters during the Winter. This I&s;land had its Name from the noble Family of <HI>Keith,</HI> who&s;e Founder had this I&s;land, with the Barony of <HI>Ceith-mare&s;chal</HI> in <HI>Lothian,</HI> and the Hereditary Dig|nity of Earl Mare&s;chal of <HI>Scotland</HI> conferr'd upon him by King <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. in the Year 1010. for his Valour in the Battle again&s;t the <HI>Danes</HI> at <HI>Bar</HI> in <HI>Angus.</HI> It came afterwards to the Crown, and was given by King <HI>Robert</HI> II. to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Lyon</HI> of <HI>Glames,</HI> the Chief of that Family, with the Barony of <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> upon his marrying that Prince's Daughter. It is &s;ince in other Hands. It is ob&s;erved, that Hor&s;es grow fat here in a little time.</P>
<P>Higher up, within two Miles of <HI>Aberdour,</HI> lies an I&s;land, called ST. COLM'S INCH, as being dedicated to St. <HI>Columba:</HI> it had formerly a famous Abbey, with large Endowments, but it is now ruined; and upon the Alienation of Abbey Lands, was given to the Lord <HI>Downs,</HI> a Branch of the Family of <HI>Stuart.</HI></P>
<P>Higher up lies INCHGARVY, between two Pro|montories, near the <HI>Queen's Ferry</HI>; it was al&s;o fortified, and the Guns of the Forts could reach the Shore or both Sides, &s;o that no Ships could &s;afely pa&s;s it without Leave.</P>
<P>On the Top of an high rocky Hill, at the We&s;t|end of the I&s;lands of <HI>Orkney,</HI> near the Village of <HI>Skeal,</HI> there is a &s;ort of Pavement con&s;i&s;ting of Stones variou&s;ly figured, &s;ome like an Heart, others like a Crown, a Leg, a Weaver's Shuttle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It takes up above a Quarter of a Mile in Length, and from 20 to 30 Feet in Breadth. In removing any of the&s;e Stones, the Figure is as neat on the Under|&s;ide, as the Upper, and being as big as the Life, all of one Colour, or a reddi&s;h Kind of Stone, pitched in a reddi&s;h Earth, and the Pavemen &s;o very long, it cannot be any of the te&s;&s;ellated or chequer'd
<PB N="300" REF="301">
Works of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Part of a Garden Wall is decorated with the&s;e Stones, and many of them are taken away by the neighbouring Gentry, to &s;et them up like <HI>Dutch</HI> Tiles in their Chimneys; &s;o that, at this rate, in le&s;s than a Century, this Pavement will in all likelihood &s;ub&s;i&s;t only in Books.</P>
<P>It has been long ob&s;erved, that the I&s;lands of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> e&s;pecially the We&s;tern, lie more conveniently for carrying on, and bringing the Fi&s;hing-trade to Perfection, than any other Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> I. began the Experiment, in Con|junction with a Company of Merchants; but that De&s;ign mi&s;carried by the Civil War, which unhappily broke out at that Time. The next At|tempt was made by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. who al&s;o joined with &s;ome Merchants; and this &s;ucceeded well for a Time. Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, from &s;uch as &s;aw the Fi&s;h that were caught by that Company, that they were reputed the be&s;t in <HI>Europe</HI> of their Kind, and accordingly bore a greater Price. But this De&s;ign was ruin'd thus: The King having Occa&s;ion for Money, was advi&s;ed to withdraw that which was employ'd in the Fi&s;hery; at which the Merchants being di&s;plea&s;ed, and di&s;agreeing likewi&s;e among them&s;elves, they al&s;o withdrew their Money, and that De&s;ign has never been renewed &s;ince that Time.</P>
<P>But the Revival of this Undertaking will, in all Probability, be one of the Ble&s;&s;ings which this I&s;land will reap by the late happy Union. What can't <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money, and <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Indu&s;try, effect!</P>
<P>The &s;ettling a Fi&s;hery in tho&s;e Parts will rai&s;e a Nur&s;ery of &s;tout and able Seamen in a very &s;hort time, to &s;erve the Government on all Occa&s;ions. A new Colony need not be planted there; for the Inhabitants of the <HI>We&s;tern I&s;les</HI> are reckoned to be about 50,000; many of whom have no Employ|ment, and are generally dextrous at the Oar, and
<PB N="301" REF="302">
only want to be furni&s;hed with proper Materials for the Fi&s;hing-trade, which would encourage the &s;etting up other Manufactures. The Commodiou&s;|ne&s;s and Safety of the numerous Bays and Harbours in tho&s;e I&s;les &s;eem as if Nature had de&s;igned them for promoting Trade. They have &s;uch abundance of Turf and Peat for Fewel, as would furni&s;h Salt-pans with Fire all the Year round. The Coa&s;t of each I&s;land affords many thou&s;and Loads of Sea-ware, which, if pre&s;erved, might be &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed for making Gla&s;s, and likewi&s;e Kelp for Soap. Several of the I&s;lands afford great Quantities of fine Clay; which, if improved, might turn to a good Account in making Earthen-ware of all Sorts. Cod and Ling, as well as le&s;&s;er Fi&s;h, are to be had on the Coa&s;ts of the le&s;&s;er as well as the greater I&s;lands; and what has been &s;aid of the <HI>We&s;tern I&s;les,</HI> may be &s;aid likewi&s;e of the I&s;les of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland.</HI></P>
