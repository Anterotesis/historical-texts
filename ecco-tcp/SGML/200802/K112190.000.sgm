<P><HI>The</HI> White King, <HI>and his Character.</HI> He is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> great Red Dragon who is gorg'd and ready to bur&s;t wit the Blood of all Nations: He is known by the mighti|ne&s;s of his Power, and the ab&s;olutene&s;s of his Dominion The be&s;t of his Subjects are the greate&s;t of his Slaves and his mo&s;t applauded Acts of Devotion con&s;i&s;t in th Multitude of Victims be has Sacrificed to the fal&s;e God that he Wor&s;hippeth.

<P>This <HI>White King</HI> you may plainly &s;ee by th De&s;cription is meant for the <HI>French</HI> King, who ha been &s;o long foretold to be a <HI>Tyrant</HI> over his People and a <HI>Scourge</HI> to the Neighbouring Nations, as th <HI>Prophets</HI> of old deliver'd in dark Mi&s;teries thei <HI>Prophe&s;ies</HI> concerning the coming of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> the down-fall of the <HI>Per&s;ian Monarchy</HI> under <HI>Darius;</HI> and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> ri&s;e of the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> under <HI>Alexander,</HI> and afterwards that of the <HI>Cae&s;ars.</HI> Can any thing point plainer at him than to &s;ay <HI>He is gorg'd with the Blood of all Nations,</HI> when there is &s;carce one in <HI>Europe</HI> whom the <HI>French</HI> King has not imbrued his Hands in their Blood? The next is as plain, which points at Power, and the Arbitrarine&s;s of his Government&punc; and wherein he has made the be&s;t of his Subjects&punc; which are the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had &s;carce been able to have kept his Crown, now <HI>Slaves</HI> by &s;ending &s;everal to the <HI>Gallies,</HI> and forcing
<PB N="5" REF="4">
others to quit his Dominions. The re&s;t of the <HI>Pro|phe&s;ie</HI> is as true in every particular, and therefore needle&s;s to repeat.</P>
<P>The Time when the <HI>White King</HI> &s;hall rai&s;e the <HI>Dead Man,</HI> and the Signs of his <HI>Coming.</HI> The Time when this &s;hall come to pa&s;s &s;hall be the time after <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall lo&s;e the Di&s;tinction of their former Names, and be &s;wallow'd up in their Original Name of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> And the Sign that &s;hall be given &s;hall be that when <HI>Fal&s;e Prophets</HI> ari&s;e, and &s;hall pretend to rai&s;e the <HI>Dead Man;</HI> but this &s;hall not be the <HI>Dead Man</HI> which the <HI>White King</HI> &s;hall rai&s;e; for he is not a <HI>Dead Man,</HI> but to the Hopes and Expectations of the People he is Dead only, but &s;hall ri&s;e again.</P>
<P>This is directly hit at the <HI>Union</HI> of the Two Kingdoms, and cannot be interpreted to mean any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ther thing, but what the <HI>Dead Man</HI> is wou'd look <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> little doubtful, but the next <HI>Paragraph</HI> explains it, which if it did not the pre&s;ent times wou'd &s;how that it has brought him to Life which every Bo|dy thought was <HI>Dead,</HI> to us at lea&s;t; but that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">hich is very particular, and wonderfully remark|able in deed, is the Sign given us of tho&s;e times that is when <HI>Fal&s;e Prophets</HI> &s;hall ari&s;e and pretend to ai&s;e the <HI>Dead Man,</HI> before ever the other <HI>Dead Man</HI> hat was meant, was ever thought to make &s;uch a <HI>Re&s;urrection.</HI> This is worth a &s;erious Reflection to hink that ju&s;t at a time when the&s;e <HI>Fal&s;e Prophets</HI> pretend to rai&s;e <HI>Emes,</HI> one of their pretended <HI>Pro|bets,</HI> which is their <HI>Dead Man,</HI> the <HI>White King,</HI> in he <HI>Prophe&s;ie,</HI> is pretending to rai&s;e to us, the People of the <HI>Union,</HI> another <HI>Dead Man,</HI> contrary to all our Thoughts, our Apprehen&s;ions, or Expectations,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
and who this <HI>Dead Man</HI> is, the next Paragraph of the <HI>Prophe&s;ie</HI> &s;hows.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Dead Man</HI> is the <HI>Lyon</HI>'s <HI>Whelp,</HI> which the <HI>Eagle</HI> had drove away from the <HI>Old Lyon</HI> before.</P>
<P>This part of the <HI>Prophe&s;ie</HI> is explain'd by that which foretold the <HI>Revolution</HI> by the coming of an <HI>Eagle</HI> out of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> which was the then Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> afterwards our Glorious <HI>Re&s;torer</HI> King <HI>Wil|liam,</HI> who came to catch the <HI>Old Lyon</HI>'s <HI>Whelp,</HI> which may be plainly under&s;tood of the then <HI>Pretended Prince</HI> of <HI>Wales,</HI> who is afterwards all along call'd the <HI>Dead Man,</HI> which very emphatically &s;hows us, He is a Per&s;on <HI>Dead</HI> and lo&s;t to all Rea&s;onable Ex|pectation. But this is the <HI>Dead Man</HI> which the <HI>Eagle</HI> had drove away from the <HI>Old Lyon,</HI> as this <HI>Pretender</HI> was driven from K. <HI>James,</HI> before he <HI>Ab|dicated</HI> the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and therefore he is a <HI>Dead Man</HI> indeed that is excluded all hopes of Reigning, by the Crown of <HI>Great Britain</HI>'s being Settled on the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover,</HI> and in a <HI>Prote|&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> for ever, &s;o that he is actually <HI>Dead</HI> to the Law. Therefore we &s;hall proceed to exa|mine in the next place.</P>
<P><HI>The Bu&s;ine&s;s that the</HI> Dead Man <HI>is &s;ent about by the</HI> White King. And the <HI>White King</HI> having War with all the Nations round about him, &s;etting up one King, and pulling down another, at la&s;t rai&s;es up the <HI>Dead Man,</HI> which was the <HI>Old Lyon</HI>'s <HI>Whelp,</HI> and furni&s;hes him with Wooden Hor&s;es to carry him to his Native Country, there to a&s;&s;ault it, and de&s;troy the Peo|ple for the hardne&s;s of their Hearts, and their Infide|lity in not beliening that the <HI>Dead Man</HI> &s;hou'd come again, whom they &s;pued out from among&s;t them long be|fore.
