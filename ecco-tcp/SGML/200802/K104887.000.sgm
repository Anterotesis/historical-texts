<P>'TIS in Acknowledgment of the Fa|vours your Lord&s;hip has conferr'd upon me, that I pre&s;ume to place your Name before the&s;e Papers.

<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Preface to my former Volume, I have accounted for the De|&s;ign, and Method, and Stile of tho&s;e Relations of my Travels: What I have more to &s;ay of that kind, is chiefly with reference to what I now offer the Reader. Thus far I have thought fit to change my Method in this Volume, as to divide it into di&s;tinct Parts, becau&s;e the Matters it treats of are &s;o different from one another, in point of Time, or other Circum&s;tances: But &s;till in each Part I have taken the &s;ame cour&s;e of making &s;everal Chapters, that this Volume might retain &s;ome Uniformity with the other.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t of the&s;e is that Account I promi&s;ed of my Voyages from <HI>Achin</HI> in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> to &s;everal Places in the <HI>E. Indies;</HI> of which I forbore to particularize in the former Volume, for Rea&s;ons there mentioned. I have now more than di&s;charg'd my &s;elf of that Promi&s;e: For I have improved my own Ob&s;ervations, e&s;pecially as to <HI>Tonquin,</HI> by tho&s;e of &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, who made a con&s;iderable &s;tay in that Kingdom. I am abundantly &s;atisfied my Self of their Ability and Integrity; the proper Qualifications in things of this Nature: And could I have ob|tained their leave, the <HI>Reader</HI> al&s;o &s;hould have had the Satisfaction of knowing to whom he was to a&s;cribe &s;everal of tho&s;e particulars: How|ever, I have taken frequent Occa&s;ions to di&s;tingui&s;h in general what I &s;aw, from what I was informed of. This part is the <HI>Supplement</HI> of what is contained in the <HI>former Volume;</HI> and compleats the <HI>Voyage round the World.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> Part contains what relates to the Time I &s;pent in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> either as a Logwood-Cutter, or a Trader to them. This was before I made my Voyage round the World, as the <HI>Reader</HI> will per|ceive: And upon this Occa&s;ion, therefore, I have gone &s;o far back, as to &s;peak of my fir&s;t entrance upon this Rambling kind of Life. For the Account it gives of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and the Neighbouring parts of <HI>Jucatan</HI> and <HI>New Spain,</HI> &amp;c. I refer the <HI>Reader</HI> to the Work it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> Part is an Account of the Winds, and Weather, Storms, Tides, and Currents of the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> round the World; which may be of U&s;e towards the Improvement of <HI>Navigation,</HI> and that part of <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory.</HI> 'Tis the &s;ub&s;tance of what I have remark't or learnt, about Things of that kind, in &s;o long a cour&s;e of Roving upon the Seas: And tho' I have not omitted to &s;peak of the&s;e Matters in the &s;eries of my Voyages, as occa&s;ion offered, yet I thought it might not be un|acceptable,
<PB REF="5">
to put them together in one View al&s;o by them&s;elves, in a Methodical Di&s;cour&s;e, ranging the &s;everal Particulars under their pro|per Heads.</P>
<P>To render the&s;e things the more intelligible, I have prefixed pecu|liar <HI>Maps:</HI> One to each of the foregoing Parts; but two to this of the Winds, &amp;c. that the Variety of Trade-Winds might &s;ome way be Pictured, as it were, to the Eye; and the Reader might be the le&s;s li|able to be confounded with the Multiplicity of words, denoting the &s;e|veral Points of the Compa&s;s, or other Terms nece&s;&s;ary to the De&s;cripti|onal part of the Di&s;cour&s;e. The&s;e Maps contain the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> and &s;o much towards each Pole as was of U&s;e to my De&s;ign: And the Pro|jection differs in this only from the Common Maps, that in order to &s;hew the <HI>Atlantick</HI> and <HI>South</HI> Oceans each in one entire view, the Divi&s;ion of the Hemi&s;pheres is made, not at the fir&s;t Meridian, (reckoning from <HI>Te|neriffe,</HI>) nor at the 350th, as is u&s;ual al&s;o, and as 'tis in the Globe-Map, prefixed to my fir&s;t Volume, but at the 300th; yet &s;till retaining the common Graduation in the <HI>Equator,</HI> from that cu&s;tomary Meridian of the <HI>Canaries,</HI> or C. <HI>Verd.</HI></P>
<P>And upon this mention of the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Sea, there is one thing I would ob&s;erve to the <HI>Reader,</HI> that I u&s;e that name not only for the North Sea, as 'tis called, but for this whole Ocean, on both &s;ides of the <HI>Equator</HI> between <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Africk</HI> on one hand, and <HI>America</HI> on the other. If I be que&s;tioned for taking this Liberty, I &s;hould think it enough to &s;ay, that I wanted a general name for this whole Ocean, and I could not find one more proper. And yet even as to the Rea&s;on of the thing, if the Di&s;covery of a Sea to the South of the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> or the <HI>Mexican</HI> Coa&s;t, were ground &s;ufficient for the extending the Name of the <HI>South Sea</HI> to all that large&s;t Ocean of the World, tho' it lies We&s;t rather of the whole Continent of <HI>America;</HI> much more may I be allow|ed a le&s;s con&s;iderable Enlargement of the Name of <HI>Atlantick</HI> Sea, which others have long &s;ince extended to &s;o great a part of this Ocean, from its Original narrow Confines, the Neighbourhood of Mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> and the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Mauritania.</HI> I know that &s;o much of this Ocean as lies South of the R. <HI>Niger,</HI> went u&s;ually by the Name of the <HI>Aethiopick</HI> Sea: Yet I can't learn a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for it: For tho' 'tis true, that the Ancients call'd all the South parts of <HI>Africk</HI> to each Sea, <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> yet even upon this bottom, the Name of <HI>Aethiopick</HI> Sea &s;hould have been left common to the Oceans on each &s;ide of the Cape of <HI>Good Hope.</HI> But if the Name mu&s;t be appropriated, why to this on the We&s;t of <HI>Africa?</HI> why not rather to that on its E. Coa&s;t? which lies nearer the <HI>Inward</HI> or more <HI>proper Aethiopia,</HI> now the <HI>Abi&s;&s;ine</HI> Empire; and con&s;equently might better be called <HI>Aethiopick</HI> Sea. Accordingly I have ventured to call it &s;o, <HI>Vol.</HI> 1. <HI>page</HI> 289. making it there the &s;ame as the <HI>Indian;</HI>
<PB REF="6">
which I al&s;o make to be all the Ocean from the Ea&s;t Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> to the remote&s;t of the <HI>E. India</HI> I&s;lands, <HI>New Holland,</HI> and <HI>New Guinea:</HI> Tho' this Name al&s;o of <HI>Indian</HI> Sea has been under&s;tood, u&s;ually, of narrower bounds. But be that as it will, I was for u&s;ing comprehen&s;ive Names; and therefore the&s;e three Names of <HI>Atlantick, Indian,</HI> and <HI>South</HI> Seas or Oceans, &s;erve me for the whole Ambit of the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> and what el&s;e I have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of.</P>
<P>To the&s;e three Parts is added a general <HI>Index</HI> of both <HI>Volumes.</HI> The fir&s;t Volume &s;hould not have been publi&s;hed without one, but that was re&s;erved to be annexed to this; that the Reader might not have the Trouble of turning over 2 Alphabets.</P>
<P>Thus what I de&s;igned as an Appendix to the former <HI>Volume,</HI> is grown to its &s;elf a Volume an&s;werable to the other. And I am &s;en&s;ible there is one part of the intended <HI>Appendix</HI> yet behind; <HI>viz.</HI> The De&s;criprion of the <HI>South Sea</HI> Coa&s;ts of <HI>America,</HI> from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pilot Books, &amp;c. I confe&s;s I had thoughts of crowding it into this Volume: But be&s;ides the dryne&s;s and fatigue of &s;uch a Work, and the &s;mall lei&s;ure I had for it, I was quite di&s;couraged from attempting it, when upon a nearer View of the matter I found in tho&s;e De&s;criptions and Charts a repugnance with each other in many particulars; and &s;ome things which from my own Experience I knew to be erroneous. Indeed as they are they may be very u&s;eful to Sailors in tho&s;e Parts, being generally right enough in the main: But I was loth to undertake a Work, much of which mu&s;t have con&s;i&s;ted in correcting Mi&s;takes, and yet have left unaviodable many more to be rectified. Others may have Time and Helps for this Affair; and future Di&s;coveries may give greater Light to direct them. To me it &s;hall &s;uffice, that bating this one particular, I have here en|deavoured to perform what I had made the Publick expect from me.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Reader will find upon peru&s;ing my <HI>Voyage round the World,</HI> that I then omitted to &s;peak particularly of the excur&s;ions I made to <HI>Tonquin,</HI> to <HI>Malacca, Fort St. George,</HI> and <HI>Bencouli,</HI> from <HI>Achin</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Sumatra;</HI> together with the De&s;cription I intended to give of tho&s;e parts. I do but ju&s;t mention them there; but &s;hall now proceed to a more di&s;tinct account of them.</P>
<P>And to keep to the order of time, the Reader may recollect, that my fir&s;t departure from <HI>Achin</HI> was to <HI>Tonquin,</HI> along with Captain <HI>Weldon,</HI> about <HI>July</HI> 1688. as I have &s;aid p. 505th. of my former Volume. I have there related in a page or two before, to how weak a condition my &s;elf and my Companions were brought, through the fatigues of our pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Nicobar</HI> to <HI>Achin:</HI> yet did not my weakne&s;s take me off from contriving &s;ome employment or expedition, whereby I might have a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Captain <HI>Weldon</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="11">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> touched here, to &s;ell the Slaves he had brought with him from <HI>Fort St. George;</HI> it being in his way to the Streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Tonquin,</HI> whither he was bound. This afforded me the op|portunity of trying that Voyage, to which he kindly invited me, and to which I was the more incouraged becau&s;e he had a good Surgeon in his Ship, who&s;e Advice I needed: and my friend Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> was particularly animated thereby; who had al&s;o re&s;olved upon this Voyage, and was in a weak|er condition than my &s;elf. Be&s;ides, Capt. <HI>Weldon</HI> promi&s;ed to buy a Sloop at <HI>Tonquin,</HI> of which he would make me Commander, to go a trading Voyage from thence to <HI>Cochinchina, Champa, Cam|bodia,</HI> or &s;ome others of the adjacent Countries: which Trade has been &s;carce, yet has been attempt|ed by our Country-men, and there were hopes it might turn to a good account; but this project came to nothing.</P>
<P>However, Captain <HI>Weldon</HI> having fini&s;hed his bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Achin,</HI> I &s;et out thence with him thro' the Streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI> and we &s;oon arrived at the Town of <HI>Malacca:</HI> of which Town and Country, I &s;hall have a better occa&s;ion to &s;peak hereafter. Here we found the <HI>Cae&s;ar of London,</HI> commanded by Captain <HI>Wright,</HI> who came from <HI>Bombay,</HI> and was bound to <HI>China.</HI> He &s;topt here to water and refre&s;h, as is u&s;ual for Ships to do that pa&s;s the&s;e Streights. By him we were in|formed that three other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships had touched here, and were pa&s;t on to the Fa&s;tward ten days before. The&s;e 3 Ships came from <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> in company with Captain <HI>Weldon:</HI> but his bu&s;ine&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">alling him to <HI>Achin,</HI> they in the mean time pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ecuting their Voyage, got the &s;tart of us thus much. The <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was &s;oon ready to &s;ail again, and went away the next Morning after our arrival at <HI>Malacca.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> Our Captain being a Stranger to the Bay of <HI>Ton|quin,</HI> as were all his Ships company, he hired a <HI>Dutch</HI> Pilot at <HI>Malacca;</HI> and having fini&s;hed his bu&s;ine&s;s there, we &s;et &s;ail, two days after the <HI>Cae|&s;ar.</HI> We were de&s;irous to overtake the&s;e four Ships, and therefore crouded all the Sail we could make; having a &s;trong we&s;terly Wind, accompa|nied with many hard Gu&s;ts and Tornadoes: and the very next day we got &s;ight of them; for they had not yet pa&s;&s;ed through a narrow Pa&s;&s;age, called the Streights of <HI>Sincapore.</HI> We &s;oon got up with them, and pa&s;t through together; and &s;ailing about three leagues farther we anchored near an I&s;land called <HI>Pulo Nuttee,</HI> belonging to the Kingdom of <HI>Jihore.</HI></P>
<P>Here Captain <HI>Weldon</HI> took in Wood and Water, and &s;ome of the <HI>Indian</HI> Inhabitans came aboard us in their Canoas, of whom we bought a few Coco|nuts, Plantains, and fre&s;h Fi&s;h. We &s;taid here not above 24 hours; for the other Ships had filled mo&s;t of their Water at other I&s;lands near this, before we came up with them: for tho' Ships do u&s;ually take in Water at <HI>Malacca</HI> Town, yet they do as frequently di&s;charge it again at &s;ome of the&s;e I&s;lands, and take in better.</P>
<P>We &s;ailed the next day, and kept near the <HI>Ma|lacca</HI> &s;hore; and there pa&s;&s;ing by the Mouth of the River <HI>Jihore,</HI> we left many other I&s;lands on our Starboard &s;ide.</P>
<P>The River of <HI>Jihore</HI> runs by the City of that name, which is the &s;eat of the little Kingdom of <HI>Jihore.</HI> This Kingdom lies on the Continent of <HI>Malacca,</HI> and con&s;i&s;ts of the extremity or doubling of that Promontory. It abounds with Pepper, and other goood Commodities.</P>
<P>They are a <HI>Mahometan</HI> People, very warlike, and de&s;irous of Trade. They delight much in Shipping and going to Sea, all the neighbouring
<PB N="5" REF="13">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> I&s;lands in a manner being Colonies of this King|dom, and under its Government. They coa&s;t about in their own Shipping to &s;everal parts of <HI>Sumatra, Java,</HI> &amp;c. their Ve&s;&s;els are but &s;mall, yet very &s;erviceable; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> buy up a great many of them at a &s;mall price, and make good trading Sloops of them. But they fir&s;t fit them up after their own fa&s;hion, and put a Rud|der to them, which the <HI>Jihorians</HI> don't u&s;e, tho' they are very good Seamen in their way; but they make their Ve&s;&s;els &s;harp at each end, tho' but one end is u&s;ed as the Head: and in&s;tead of a Rudder, they have on each &s;ide the Stern a thing like a very broad Oar, one of which they let down into the Water at plea&s;ure, as there is occa&s;ion to &s;teer the Ship either to the one &s;ide or the other, always letting down that which is to the Leeward. They have Proes of a particular neatne&s;s and curio&s;ity. We call them Half-moon Proes, for they turn up &s;o much at each end from the Water, that they much re&s;emble a Half-moon, with the Horns upwards. They are kept very clean, &s;ail well, and are much u&s;ed by them in their Wars. The People of <HI>Ji&s;hore</HI> have formerly endea|voured to get a Commerce with our Nation. For what rea&s;on that trade is neglected by us, I know not. The <HI>Dutch</HI> trade very much there; and have lately endeavoured to bring the King, who is very young, to their bow.</P>
<P>At the farther end of the Streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI> among many other I&s;lands, we &s;ailed by tho&s;e of <HI>Pulo Oro,</HI> and <HI>Pulo Timaon:</HI> which la&s;t is a place often touched at for wood, water, and other re|fre&s;hments, tho' we pa&s;t by it. Among other things, there are great plenty of excellent Green Turtle among the&s;e I&s;lands.</P>
<P>Being at length got clear of the I&s;lands into the wide Ocean, we &s;teered away &s;till together

<P>This I&s;land lies in about 13 d. North. It is much frequented by the <HI>Cochinchine&s;e,</HI> who&s;e Country be|gins hereabouts, bordering on the Kingdom of <HI>Champa.</HI> They are mo&s;t Fi&s;hermen that come hi|ther, and their chief bu&s;ine&s;s is to make Oyl of Porpu&s;&s;es; for the&s;e Fi&s;h are found in great plenty here at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and then the <HI>Co|chinchine&s;e</HI> re&s;ort hither to take them.

<P>Over again&s;t the&s;e la&s;t I&s;lands, on the Main, there is a large navigable River empties it &s;elf into the Sea. The City of <HI>Quinam</HI> &s;tands on the banks of this River, and is &s;aid to be the principal City of the Kingdom of <HI>Cochinchina.</HI> As to its di&s;tance from the Sea, its bigne&s;s, &s;trength, riches, &amp;c. I am yet in the dark: only I have been in|form'd, that if a Ship is ca&s;t away on this Kingdom, the Seamen that e&s;cape drowning and get a&s;hore become Slaves to the King. Captain <HI>John Tiler</HI> was thus &s;erv'd, and de&s;paired of ever getting his freedom; but after a con&s;iderable &s;tay there he was taken notice of by the King, and upon pro|mi&s;e of returning thither again to trade there, he was &s;ent away. I &s;ailed in a Ve&s;&s;el of his after this: but I never found him inclin'd to Trade thither any more. However, notwith&s;tanding this their &s;everity to Shipwrackt People, I have beeen informed by Captain <HI>Tiler</HI> and others, that they have a de&s;ire to Trade, tho' they are yet de|&s;titute of the means to attain it. This de&s;ire of Trade, they &s;eem to have taken up from &s;ome <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Fugitives, who fled from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> when they conquered their Country: and being kindly received by the&s;e <HI>Cochinchine&s;e,</HI> and having among them many Artificers, they in&s;tructed their kind protectors in many u&s;eful Arts, of which they were wholly ignorant before. 'Tis probable this their cu&s;tom of &s;eizing Shipwrackt Seamen may &s;oon vani&s;h by the coming in of Trade, which is already
<PB N="8" REF="16">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> advancing among them; for the Merchants of <HI>China</HI> do now drive &s;ome &s;mall traffick among the&s;e people, and fetch thence &s;ome &s;mall quantities of Pepper, <HI>Lignum Aloes,</HI> and <HI>Aguala</HI> Wood, which is much e&s;teemed for its rare &s;cent, and is very valuable in other places of <HI>India.</HI> They al&s;o fetch Betle from hence, it growing here in great plenty. I have had no account of any Shipping the <HI>Cochinchine&s;e</HI> have of their own, but I have met with them in their open Boats of 4, 5, or 6 Tun; imploying them&s;elves chiefly in getting Pitch and Tar from <HI>Pulo Condore,</HI> in fi&s;hing about the Coa&s;t and I&s;land to get Oyl, and in fetching <HI>Aguala</HI> Wood from the Bay of <HI>Siam;</HI> which, whether it grows there or no, I can't tell, but I have heard that 'tis only Drift-wood ca&s;t a&s;hore by the Sea.</P>
<P>The &s;eizing Shipwrackt men has been al&s;o a cu&s;tom at <HI>Pegu,</HI> but whether &s;till continued I know not. They lookt on &s;uch as men pre&s;erv|ed by God, purpo&s;ely for them to feed and main|tain; and therefore the King ordered them to be maintained by his Subjects; neither was any work required of them, but they had liberty to beg. By this means they got food and rayment from the Inhabitants, who were zealou&s;ly chari|table to them.</P>
<P>But to proceed; we kept a little without all the I&s;lands, and coa&s;ting 5 or 6 leagues further, we &s;tood right over towards the N. E. Cod of the Bay of <HI>Tonquin.</HI> The Bay of <HI>Tonquin</HI> has its en|trance between the S. E. point of <HI>Champa</HI> on the We&s;t &s;ide, which lies in the lat. of about 12 d. North, and the I&s;land of <HI>Aynam</HI> near the S. W. part of <HI>China,</HI> on the Ea&s;t &s;ide. The I&s;land of <HI>Ay|nam</HI> is in about 19 d. North. It is a pretty con&s;i|derable I&s;land, well peopled with <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Inhabi|tants. They have Ships of their own, and drive
<PB N="9" REF="17">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> a great trade by Sea. I have &s;een many of their Ships, &s;ome of 100 Tun, with Outlagers on both &s;ides, and others like ordinary Jonks, without Out|lagers; but am wholly ignorant of their Trade, any farther than what I have mentioned of their having Pearl Oy&s;ters there, in the 7th Chapter of my <HI>Voyage round the World,</HI> page 174.</P>
<P>Near the Cod of the Bay of <HI>Tonquin</HI> there are abundance of &s;mall I&s;lands, of which I &s;hall &s;peak more hereafter. The mouth of the Bay &s;eems to be barred up with the great &s;hole of <HI>Pracel,</HI> which lies &s;tretched at length before it, yet leaving two wide Channels, one at each end; &s;o that Ships may pa&s;s in or out either way. And therefore even the Ships that are bound from the Streigths of <HI>Malacca</HI> or <HI>Siam</HI> to <HI>China,</HI> may as well pa&s;s to and from within the &s;hole as without.</P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Tonquin</HI> is about 30 leagues wide in the broade&s;t place. There is good &s;ounding and anchoring all over it: and in the middle, where it is deepe&s;t, there is about 46 fathom water. There you have black Oaze, and dark Peppery Sand: but on the We&s;t &s;ide there is reddi&s;h Oazy Sand. Be&s;ide the other I&s;lands before-mentioned, there are others of le&s;s note on the <HI>Cochinchina</HI> Coa&s;t; but none of them all above 4 or 5 miles from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>In the bottom of the Bay al&s;o, there are &s;ome &s;mall I&s;lands, clo&s;e by the <HI>Tonquin</HI> &s;hore: 2 of the&s;e are of e&s;pecial note, not for their bigne&s;s, but for Sea-marks for the 2 principal Rivers, or Mouth rather of the chief River of <HI>Tonquin.</HI> One of the&s;e Rivers or Mouths, is called <HI>Rokbo.</HI> It di&s;charges it &s;elf into the Sea near the the N. W. cor|ner of the Bay: and the mouth of it is in about 20d. 6m. N. This River or branch I was not at; but have been informed, that it has not above 12 foot water at the entrance; but that its bottom
<PB N="10" REF="18">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> is &s;oft Oaz, and therefore very convenient for &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, and it is the way that all the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and <HI>Siamars</HI> do u&s;e. About a League to the We&s;tward of this Rivers mouth, there is a &s;mall pretty high I&s;land call'd <HI>Fi&s;hers I&s;land.</HI> It lieth about 2 mile from the &s;hore, and it hath good an|choring about it in 17 or 18 foot water: and therefore it is not only a Sea-mark for the River, but a &s;ecure place to ride in, and very convenient for Ships to anchor at, to &s;helter them&s;elves when they come hither, e&s;pecially if they have not a pre&s;ent opportunity to enter the River; either becau&s;e of coming too late in the year, or being hindred by bad weather.</P>
<P>The other River or Mouth, was that by which we entered; and 'tis larger and deeper than the former. I know not its particular name; but for di&s;tinction I &s;hall call it the River of <HI>Domea;</HI> be|cau&s;e the fir&s;t Town of note, that I &s;aw on its bank was &s;o called. The mouth of the River is in lat. 20 d. 45 m. It di&s;embogues 20 leagues to the N. E. of <HI>Rokbo.</HI> There are many dangerous Sands and Shoals between the&s;e 2 Rivers, which &s;tretch into the Sea 2 leagues or more: and all the Coa&s;t, even from the <HI>Cochinchina</HI> &s;hore on the We&s;t, to <HI>China</HI> on the Ea&s;t, admits of Shoals and Sands, which yet in &s;ome places lie &s;tretched farther off from the &s;hore than in others.</P>
<P>This River of <HI>Domea</HI> is that by which mo&s;t <HI>European</HI> Ships enter, for the &s;ake of its depth: yet here is a Bar of near 2 mile broad, and the Chan|nel is about half a mile broad, having Sands on each &s;ide. The depth of the River is various at different times and &s;ea&s;ons, by the relation of the Pilots who are be&s;t acquainted here: for at &s;ome times of the year here is not above 15 or 16 foot water on a &s;pring tide; and at other times here are 26 or 27 foot. The highe&s;t tides are &s;aid to he in the month of <HI>No|vember,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="19">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> <HI>December,</HI> and <HI>January,</HI> when the Nor|therly Mon&s;oons blow; and the lowe&s;t in <HI>May, June,</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> when the Southerly Mon&s;oons blow; but to be particular in them is beyond my experience.</P>
<P>The Channel of the Bar is hard Sand, which makes it the more dangerous: and the Tides whirl|ing among the Sands, &s;et divers ways in a Tides time; which makes it the more dangerous &s;till. Therefore Ships that come hither, commonly wait for a Pilot to direct them, and if they arrive when it is Nepe-tide, they mu&s;t &s;tay for a Spring before a Pilot will come off to take charge of them. The mark of this River is a great high ridgy Mountain in the Country, called the <HI>Elephant.</HI> This mu&s;t be brought to bear N. W. by N: then &s;teering towards the &s;hore, the water runs &s;hallower, till you come into 6 fathom, and then you will be 2 or 3 miles from the foot or entrance of the Bar, and about the &s;ame di&s;tance from a &s;mall I&s;land called <HI>Pearl I&s;land;</HI> which will then bear neare&s;t N. N. E. Having the&s;e marks and depth, you may anchor, and wait for a Pilot.</P>
<P>The Pilots for this River are Fi&s;hermen, who live at a Village called <HI>Bat&s;ha,</HI> at the mouth of the River; &s;o &s;eated, that they can &s;ee all Ships that wait for a Pilot, and hear the Guns too, that are often fired as &s;ignals by <HI>Europeans,</HI> to give notice of their arrival.</P>
<P>It was in the road before the Bar, in &s;ight of the <HI>Elephant</HI> Land, that we found the <HI>Rainbow</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> Captain <HI>Pool</HI> Commander, riding and waiting for a Pilot, when we and Captain <HI>Lacy</HI> arrived. Captain <HI>Pool</HI> came directly from <HI>England,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing thro' the Streights of <HI>Sundy,</HI> touched at <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>He had lain here 2 or 3 days before we arriv'd: but the Spring-tides coming on, the Pilots came
<PB N="12" REF="20">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> aboard, and we all 3 in company pa&s;&s;ed in over the Bar, and entring about half-flood, we had 14 foot and a half water on the Bar. Being got over the Bar, we found it deeper, and the bottom &s;oft Oaz. The River at its mouth is above a mile wide, but grows narrower as you run farther up. We had a moderate Sea-breeze, and having a good tide of flood, made the be&s;t of it to reach to our an|choring place.</P>
<P>Having run about 5 or 6 leagues up the River, we pa&s;t by a Village called <HI>Domea.</HI> This is a hand|&s;ome Village: and 'twas the fir&s;t of note that we &s;aw &s;tanding on the banks. 'Tis &s;eated on the Starboard &s;ide going up, and &s;o nigh the River, that the tide &s;ometimes wa&s;hes the walls of the Hou&s;es, for the tide ri&s;es and falls here 9 or 10 foot. This Village con&s;i&s;ts of about 100 Hou&s;es. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships that trade here do always lye in the River before this Town, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Seamen, by their annual returns hither from <HI>Batavia,</HI> are very intimate with the Natives, and as free here as at their own homes: for the <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> in general are a very &s;ociable people, e&s;pecially the traders and poorer &s;ort: but of this more in its proper place. The <HI>Dutch</HI> have in&s;tructed the Natives in the art of Gardening: by which means they have abundance of Herbage for Sallading; which among other things is a great refre&s;hment to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sea|men, when they arrive here.</P>
<P>Tho' the <HI>Dutch</HI> who come to trade in this King|dom, go no higher with their Ships than this <HI>Do|mea,</HI> yet the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> u&s;ually go about 3 mile farther up, and there lye at anchor during their &s;tay in this Country. We did &s;o at this time, and pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Domea</HI> came to an anchor at that di&s;tance. The tide is not &s;o &s;trong here as at <HI>Domea;</HI> but we found not one hou&s;e near it: yet our Ships had not lain their many days before the Natives came from
<PB N="13" REF="21">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> all the Country about, and fell a building them Hou&s;es after their fa&s;hion; &s;o that in a Months time there was a little Town built near our anchoring place. This is no unu&s;ual thing in other parts of <HI>India,</HI> e&s;pecially where Ships lye long at a place, the poorer &s;ort of Natives taking this opportunity to truck and barter; and by &s;ome little offices, or begging, but e&s;pecially by bringing Women to let to hire, they get what they can of the Seamen.</P>
<P>This place where our Ships rode at anchor was not above 20 miles from the Sea: but the Trade of the Kingdom is driven at <HI>Cachao,</HI> the principal City; where for that rea&s;on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Companies have each of them their Factors con&s;tantly re&s;iding. The City was far|ther up the River, about 80 miles from our An|choring place; and our Captains got them&s;elves in a readine&s;s to go up thither; it being u&s;ual to &s;end up the goods in the Country Boats, which are large and commodious enough; and the hire is pretty rea&s;onable both for the Ve&s;&s;els, and the Men who manage them. They are <HI>Tonquine&s;e,</HI> and u&s;e both Oars and Sails. Our Factory at <HI>Cachao</HI> had news of our arrival before we came to an anchor, and immediately the chief of the Factory, with &s;ome of the King of <HI>Tonquin</HI>'s Officers, came down to us, by that time we had lain there about 4 or 5 days. The <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> Officers came to take an ac|count of the Ships and Lading, and our Captains received them with great civility, firing of Guns, fea&s;ting for two or three days, and pre&s;ents al&s;o at their return back to <HI>Cachao.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after their departure, the chief of the Factory returned thither again, and with him went our three Captains, and &s;ome others, among whom I got leave to go al&s;o. Captain <HI>Weldon</HI> had recommended me to the chief of the Factory, while he was aboard us: and my going up now to the
<PB N="14" REF="22">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> City, was in order to have his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Voyage to <HI>Cochinchina, Champa,</HI> or <HI>Cambodia,</HI> which Captain <HI>Weldon</HI> had contrived for me: nor was it his fault that it came no nothing.</P>
<P>We went from our Ships in the Country Boats we had hired, with the Tide of flood, and ancho|red in the ebb: for the Tide runs &s;trong for 30 or 40 miles beyond the place where we left our Ships. Our Men contented them&s;elves with look|ing after their goods (The <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> being very light-finger'd) and left the managment of the Boats entirely to the Boats Crew. Their Boats have but one Ma&s;t; and when the Wind is again&s;t them they take it down, and ply their Oars. As we advanced thus up the River, &s;ometimes rowing, &s;ometimes &s;ailing, we had a delightful pro&s;pect over a large level fruitful Country. It was gene|rally either Pa&s;ture or Rice-fields; and void of Trees, except only about the Villages, which &s;tood thick, and appeared mighty plea&s;ant at a di&s;tance. There are many of the&s;e Villages &s;tand clo&s;e to the Banks of the Rivers, incom|pa&s;&s;ed with Trees on the back&s;ide only, but open to the River.</P>
<P>When we came near any of the&s;e Villages, we were commonly encounter'd with Beggars, who came off to us in little Boats made of twigs, and plai&s;tered over both in&s;ide and out&s;ide with Clay, but very leaky. The&s;e were a poor Leprous Peo|ple, who for that rea&s;on are compell'd by the re&s;t to live by them&s;elves, and are permitted to beg publickly. As &s;oon as they &s;pied us they &s;et up a loud doleful cry, and as we pa&s;t by them we threw them out &s;ome Rice, which they received with great appearance of joy.</P>
<P>In about four days time we got to <HI>Hean,</HI> a Town on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the River; which is here en|tire: for a little before we came to <HI>Hean</HI> we met
<PB N="15" REF="23">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> the main &s;tream where it parts into the 2 Channels, that of <HI>Domea,</HI> which we came up, and the other of <HI>Rokbo:</HI> making a large and triangular I&s;land between them and the Sea; the Mouths of tho&s;e Channels being, as I have &s;aid, 20 leagues a&s;under.</P>
<P><HI>Hean</HI> is about 60 miles from the place where we left our Ships, and about 80 from the Sea that way: But along the River or Channel <HI>Rokbo,</HI> where the Land trends more to the Southward, it &s;eems to be farther di&s;tant from the Sea. 'Tis a con&s;iderable Town, of about 2000 Hou&s;es: but the Inhabitants are mo&s;t poor People and Soldiers, who keep a Garri&s;on there; tho' it has neither Walls, Fort, nor great Guns.</P>
<P>Here is one &s;treet belonging to the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Mer|chants. For &s;ome years ago a great many lived at <HI>Cachao;</HI> till they grew &s;o numerous, that the Natives them&s;elves were even &s;wallowed up by them. The King taking notice of it, ordered them to remove from thence, allowing them to live any where but in the City. But the major part of them pre&s;ently for&s;ook the Country, as not finding it convenient for them to live any where but at <HI>Cachao;</HI> becau&s;e that is the only place of Trade in the Country, and Trade is the Life of a <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> However &s;ome of them were content to &s;ettle at <HI>Hean,</HI> where they have remained ever &s;ince. And the&s;e Merchants, notwith&s;tanding the prohi|bition, go often to <HI>Cachao,</HI> to buy and &s;ell goods; but are not &s;uffer'd to make it their con&s;tant re&s;i|dence. There were two of the&s;e <HI>China</HI> Merchants who traded yearly to <HI>Japan,</HI> with raw and wrought Silks, bringing back Money chiefly. The&s;e all of them wore long Hair braided behind, as their own Country fa&s;hion was before the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Conque&s;t. The <HI>French</HI> too have their Factory here, not being allowed to fix at <HI>Cachao,</HI> and their Bi&s;hops

<P>The Governor of the adjacent Province lives here. He is one of the principal <HI>Mandarins</HI> of the Nation, and he has always a great many Sol|diers in the Town, and inferiour Officers, whom he employs at his plea&s;ure on any occa&s;ion. Be|&s;ides, here are al&s;o &s;ome of the King's River Fri|gats, which I &s;hall hereafter de&s;cribe, ready to be &s;ent on any expedition: and tho' no <HI>Europeans</HI> come up &s;o far as this with their Ships, (that I could learn) yet the <HI>Siamites</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> bring their Ships up the River <HI>Rokbo,</HI> quite to <HI>Hean,</HI> and lie at anchor before it: and we found there &s;everal <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Jonks. They ride a-float in the middle of the River; for the Water does not ri&s;e and fall much at this place: Neither is the flood di&s;cerned by the turning of the &s;tream; for that always runs down, tho' not &s;o &s;wift near full Sea as at other times: for the tide pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t the &s;tream, tho' faintly &s;o far up the River, has not power to turn it, but only &s;lackens its cour&s;e, and makes the Water ri&s;e a little.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Kingdom of <HI>Tonquin</HI> is bounded to the North and North Ea&s;t with <HI>China,</HI> to the We&s;t with the Kingdom of <HI>Laos,</HI> to the S. and E. with <HI>Cochinchina</HI> and the Sea, which wa&s;hes a part of this Kingdom. As to the particular bounds or extent of it, I cannot be a competent judge, coming to it by Sea, and going up directly to <HI>Cachao:</HI> but it is rea&s;onable to believe it to be a pretty large Kingdom, by the many great Pro|vinces which are &s;aid to be contained in it. That part of the Kingdom, that borders on the Sea, is all
<PB N="19" REF="27">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> very low Land: neither is there any Hill to be &s;een, but the <HI>Elephant</HI> Mountain, and a Ridge of a much le&s;s heigth continued from thence to the mouth of the River of <HI>Domea.</HI> The Land for about 60 miles up in the Country is &s;till very low, even and plain: nor is it much higher, for about 40 miles farther quite to <HI>Cachao,</HI> and beyond it; being without any &s;en&s;ible Hill, tho' generally of a tolerable good heighth, and with &s;ome gentle ri&s;ings here and there, that make it a fine plea&s;ant Champian; and the further &s;ide of this al&s;o is more level than the Champian Country it &s;elf about <HI>Hean</HI> or <HI>Cachao.</HI> Farther &s;till to the North, beyond all this, I have been informed that there is a chain of high Moun|tains, running cro&s;s the Country from Ea&s;t to We&s;t; but I could get no intimation of what is beyond them.</P>
<P>The Soil of this Country is generally very rich; That very low Land I &s;peak of towards the Sea, is mo&s;t black Earth, and the mould pretty deep. In &s;ome places there's very &s;trong Clay. The Champian Land is generally yellowi&s;h or greyi&s;h earth, of a loo&s;er and more friable &s;ub&s;tance than the former: yet in &s;ome places it has a touch of the Clay too. In the plain Country, near the Mountains la&s;t men|tioned, there are &s;aid to be &s;ome high &s;teep rocks of Marble &s;cattered up and down at unequal di|&s;tances, which &s;tanding in that large plain Savan|nah, are like &s;o many great Towers or Ca&s;tles: and they appear more vi&s;ible, becau&s;e the Land about them is not burdened with Wood, as in &s;ome places in its neighbourhood.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid &s;omewhat already of the great River and its 2 branches <HI>Rokbo</HI> and <HI>Domea,</HI> wherewith this Country is chiefly water'd: tho' it is not de&s;ti|tute of many other plea&s;ant &s;treams, that are lo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n the&s;e, in their cour&s;e towards the Sea: and probably there are many others, that run imme|diately
<PB N="20" REF="28">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> into the Sea, through their own channels, tho' not &s;o navigable as the other. The Country in general is very well watered; and by means of the great Navigable River and its Branches, it has the opportunity of Foreign Trade. This ri&s;es about the Mountains in the North, or from beyond them; whence running Southerly toward the Sea, it pa&s;&s;es thro' the before mentioned Plain of Marble Rocks, and by that time it comes to <HI>Cachao,</HI> which is about 40 or 50 miles to the South of the Moun|tains, 'tis about as broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Lambeth:</HI> yet &s;o &s;hallow in the dry Sea&s;on, as that it may be forded on Hor&s;eback. At <HI>Hean,</HI> 20 miles lower, 'tis rather broader than the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Grave&s;end;</HI> and &s;o below <HI>Hean</HI> to the place where it divides it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Tonquin</HI> is &s;aid to be divided into 8 large Provinces, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> Provinces, the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South</HI> Provinces, and the Province of <HI>Cachao</HI> in the middle between tho&s;e 4: which 5 I take to be the principal Provinces, making the heart of the Country. The other 3, which are <HI>Tenan, Tenehoa,</HI> and <HI>Ngeam,</HI> lie more upon the Borders.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Tenan</HI> is the mo&s;t Ea&s;terly, ha|ving <HI>China</HI> on the S. E. the I&s;land <HI>Aynam</HI> and the Sea on the S. and S. W. and the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Province on the N. W. This is but a &s;mall Province: its chiefe&s;t product is Rice.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Province &s;tretches away from <HI>Tenan</HI> to the <HI>North</HI> Province, having al&s;o <HI>China</HI> on its Ea&s;t &s;ide, part of the South Province, and the Province on <HI>Cachao</HI> on the We&s;t; and the Sea on the South. This is a very large Province; 'tis chiefly low Land and much of it I&s;lands, e&s;pecially the S. E. part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> it, bordering on the Sea towards <HI>Tenan;</HI> and here the Sea makes the Cod of a Bay. It has abundanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Fi&s;hermen inhabiting near the Sea: but its chie
<PB N="21" REF="29">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> produce is Rice: here is al&s;o good pa&s;turage, and much Cattle, &amp;c. <HI>Hean</HI> is the chief place of this Province, and the Seat of the <HI>Mandarin</HI> its Gover|nor.</P>
<P>The S. Province is the triangular I&s;land, made by Sea: The River of <HI>Domea</HI> is on its E. &s;ide, dividing it from the Ea&s;t Province, and <HI>Rockbo</HI> on the We&s;t, di|viding it from <HI>Tenan;</HI> having the Sea to its South. This Province is very low plain even Land, pro|ducing Rice in great abundance: here are large Pa&s;tures, and abundance of Fi&s;hermen near the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Tenehoa</HI> to the We&s;t of <HI>Rokbo,</HI> has the We&s;t Province on its North, <HI>Aynam</HI> on its We&s;t, and the Sea on its South: this Province is al&s;o low Land, chiefly abounds in Rice and Cattle, and hath a great Trade in Fi&s;hing, as all the Sea Coa&s;t has in gene|ral.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Ngeam,</HI> hath <HI>Tenehoa</HI> on the Ea&s;t, and on the South and We&s;t it borders on <HI>Co|chinchina,</HI> and has the We&s;t Province on its North. This is a pretty large Province, abounding with Rice and Cattle: and here are always Soldiers kept to guard the Frontiers from the <HI>Cochinchi|ne&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The We&s;t Provinces hath <HI>Ngeam</HI> on the South, the Kingdom of <HI>Laos</HI> on the We&s;t, the Province of <HI>Cachao</HI> on the Ea&s;t, and on the North the North Province. This is a large Province, and good Champion Land; rich in Soil, partly woody, partly pa&s;ture. The product of this Province is chiefly in <HI>Lack;</HI> and here are bred a great abun|dance of Silk-worms for making Silk.</P>
<P>The North Province is a large tract of Land, ma|king the North &s;ide of this whole Kingdom. It hath the Kingdom of <HI>Laos</HI> on the We&s;t, and <HI>China</HI> on the Ea&s;t and North, the Kingdom of <HI>Bao</HI> or <HI>Baotan</HI> on the North We&s;t, and on the South bor|ders
<PB N="22" REF="30">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> on 3 of the principal Provinces of <HI>Tonquin, viz.</HI> the We&s;t Province that of <HI>Cachao,</HI> and the Ea&s;t Pro|vince. The North Province, as it is large, &s;o it has variety of Land and Soil; a great deal of plain Champian Land, and many high Mountains which yield Gold, &amp;c. the wild Elephants of this Coun|try are found mo&s;t on the&s;e Mountains. The other parts of the Province produce Lack and Silk, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Cachao,</HI> in the Heart of the Kingdom, lies between the Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North, and South Provinces: 'tis a Champian plea&s;ant Coun|try: the Soil is yellow or grey Earth: and 'tis pretty woody, with &s;ome Savannahs. It abounds with the two principal Commodities of their Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> Lack and Silk, and has &s;ome Rice: Nor are any of the Provinces de&s;titute of the&s;e Commodities, tho' in different proportions, each according to the re|&s;pective Soil.</P>
<P>This Country has of its own growth all nece&s;&s;a|ries for the Life of Man. They have little occa|&s;ion for eatable Roots, having &s;uch plenty of Rice; yet they have Yams and Potatoes for variety; which would thrive here as well as any where, were the Natives indu&s;trious to propagate them.</P>
<P>The Land is every where cloathed with Herbage of one kind or other; but the dry Land has the &s;ame Fate that mo&s;t dry Lands have between the <HI>Tropicks,</HI> to be over-run with Pur&s;lain; which growing wild, and being pernicious to other ten|der Herbs and Plants, they are at the pains to weed it out of their Fields and Gardens, tho' 'tis very &s;weet, and makes a good Sallad for a hot Country.</P>
<P>There is a &s;ort of Herb very common in this Country, which grows wild in &s;tagnant Ponds, and floats on the &s;urface of the Water. It has a narrow, long, green thick Leaf. It is much e&s;teemed
<PB N="23" REF="31">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> and eaten by the Natives, who commend it for a very whole&s;ome herb, and &s;ay that 'tis good to expel poy&s;on. This Country produces many other &s;orts of wild Herbs; and their Gardens al&s;o are well furni&s;hed with plea&s;ant and whole&s;ome ones, e&s;pecially many Onions, of which here are great plenty.</P>
<P>Plantains and Bonanoes grow and thrive here as well as any where, but they are u&s;ed here only as Fruit, and not for Bread, as in many places of <HI>Ame|rica.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e here are divers &s;orts of excellent Fruits, both Ground-fruit and Tree fruit. The Ground-fruits are Pumpkins, Melons, Pine-apples, &amp;c. the Tree-fruits are Mangoes, a few Oranges, Limes, Coco-nuts, Guava's, Mulberries, their much e&s;teemed Betle, a Fruit called <HI>Lichea,</HI> &amp;c. The Oranges are of divers &s;orts, and two of them more excellent than the re&s;t. One &s;ort is called <HI>Cam-chain,</HI> the other is call'd <HI>Cam-quit. Cam,</HI> in the <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> Language, &s;ignifies an Orange, but what the di&s;tingui&s;hing Words <HI>Cam</HI> and <HI>Quit</HI> &s;ignifie I know not.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cam-chain</HI> is a large Orange, of a yellowi&s;h colour: the rind is prety thick and rough; and the in&s;ide is yellow like Amber. It has a mo&s;t fra|grant &s;mell, and the ta&s;te is very delicious. This &s;ort of Orange is the be&s;t that I did ever ta&s;te; I believe there are not better in the World: A Man may eat freely of them; for they are &s;o innocent that they are not denied to &s;uch as have Fevers, and other &s;ick People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cam-quit</HI> is a very &s;mall round Fruit, not above half &s;o big as the former. It is of a deep red colour, and the rind is very &s;mooth and thin. The in&s;ide al&s;o is very red, the ta&s;te is not inferi|our to the <HI>Cam-chain,</HI> but it is accounted very un|whole&s;ome Fruit, e&s;pecially to &s;uch as are &s;ubject to Fluxes; for it both creates and heightens that
<PB N="24" REF="32">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> di&s;temper. The&s;e 2 &s;orts are very plentiful and cheap, and they are in &s;ea&s;on from <HI>October</HI> till <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI> but then the <HI>Cham-chain</HI> becomes redder, and the rind is al&s;o thinner. The other &s;orts of O|ranges are not much e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>The Limes of <HI>Tonquin</HI> are the large&s;t I ever &s;aw. They are commonly as big as an ordinary Limon, but rounder. The rind is of a pale yellow colour when ripe; very thin and &s;mooth. They are ex|traordinary juicy, but not near &s;o &s;harp or tart in ta&s;te as the <HI>We&s;t-Indian</HI> Limes.</P>
<P>Coco-nnts and Guava's do thrive here very well: but there are not many of the latter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Betle</HI> of <HI>Tonquin</HI> is &s;aid to be the be&s;t in <HI>India;</HI> there is great plenty of it; and 'tis mo&s;t e&s;teemed when it is young, green and tender; for 'tis then very juicy. At <HI>Mindanao</HI> al&s;o they like it be&s;t green: but in other places of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> it is commonly chew'd when it is hard and dry.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lichea</HI> is another delicate Fruit. 'Tis as big as a &s;mall Pear, &s;omewhat long &s;haped, of a red|di&s;h colour, the rind pretty thick and rough, the in&s;ide white, inclo&s;ing a large black kernel, in &s;hape like a Bean.</P>
<P>The Country is in &s;ome part woody; but the low Land in general is either gra&s;&s;y Pa&s;ture, or Rice Fields, only thick &s;et with &s;mall Groves, which &s;tand &s;cattering very plea&s;antly over all the low-Country. The Trees in the Groves are of di|vers &s;orts, and mo&s;t unknown to us. There is good Timber for building either Ships or Hou&s;es, and indifferent good Ma&s;ts may here be had.</P>
<P>There is a Tree called by the Natives <HI>Pone,</HI> chiefly u&s;ed for making Cabinets, or other Wares to be la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">kred. This is a &s;oft &s;ort of wood, not much unlike Fir, but not &s;o &s;erviceable. Another Tree grows in this Country that yields the Lack, with which Cabinets and other &s;ine things are overlaid.
<PB N="25" REF="33">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> The&s;e grow plentifully in &s;ome places, e&s;pecially in the Champion Lands. Here are al&s;o Mulberry Trees in great plenty, to feed the Silk-worms, from whence comes the chief Trade in the Country. The Leaves of the old Trees are not &s;o nouri&s;hing to the Silk-worms, as tho&s;e of the young Trees; and therefore they rai&s;e crops of young ones every year, to feed the Worms: for when the &s;ea&s;on is over, the young Treees are pluckt up by the Roots, and more planted again&s;t the next year; &s;o the Natives &s;uffer none of the&s;e Trees to grow to bear Fruit. I heard of no Mulberries kept for eating, but &s;ome few rai&s;ed by our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants at <HI>Hean;</HI> and the&s;e bare but &s;mall hungry Fruit.</P>
<P>Here is good plenty of Rice, e&s;pecially in the low Land, that is fatned by the overflowing Ri|vers. They have two crops every year, with great increa&s;e, if they have &s;ea&s;onable Rains and Floods. One crop is in <HI>May,</HI> and the other in <HI>November:</HI> and tho' the low Land is &s;ometimes overflown with Water in the time of Harve&s;t, yet they matter it not, but gather the crop and fetch it home wet in their Canoas; and making the Rice fa&s;t in &s;mall bundles, hang it up on their Hou&s;es to dry. This &s;erves them for Bread-corn; and as the Country is very kindly for it, &s;o their Inhabitants live chiefly of it.</P>
<P>Of Land-Animals in this Country there are Elephants, Hor&s;es, Buffaloes, Bullocks, Goats, Deer, a few Sheep for the King, Hogs, Dogs, Cats, Lizards, Snakes, Scorpions, Centapees, Toads, Frogs, &amp;c. The Country is &s;o very popu|lous, that they have but few Deer or wild Game for hunting, unle&s;s it be in the remoter parts of the Kingdom. But they have abundance of Fowls both tame and wild. The tame Fowls are Cocks and Hens, and Ducks al&s;o in great plenty, of the &s;ame &s;ort with ours. The Inhabitants have little
<PB N="26" REF="34">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> Hou&s;es made purpo&s;ely for the Ducks to lay their Eggs in, driving them in every Night in laying time, and letting them out again in the morning. There are al&s;o &s;ome Gee&s;e, Parrots, Partridges, Para|kites, Turtle-Doves, &amp;c. with many &s;orts of &s;mal|ler Birds. Of wild Water-fowls they have Ducks, Widgeons, Teals, Herons, Pellicans, and Crab|catchers, (which I &s;hall de&s;cribe in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy</HI>) and other &s;maller Water-fowls. The Duck, Widgeon, and Teal are innumerable: They breed here in the Months of <HI>May, June,</HI> and <HI>July;</HI> then they fly only in couples: but from <HI>October</HI> to <HI>March</HI> you will &s;ee over all the low watry Lands great Companies together: and I have no where &s;een &s;uch large flights, nor &s;uch plenty of Game. They are very &s;hy &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ettled here; for now the Natives as well as they &s;hoot them: but before their arrival the <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> took them only with Nets, neither is this cu&s;tom left off yet. The Net that is u&s;ed for this Game is made &s;quare, and either bigger or le&s;s according as they have occa&s;ion. They fix two Poles about 10 or 11 foot high, upright in the Ground, near the Pond, where the Ducks haunt; and the Net has a head-cord, which is &s;tretched out &s;treight, made from the top of one Pole to the other; from whence the lower part of the Net hangs down loo&s;e towards the Ground; and when in the even|ing they fly towards the Pond, many of them &s;trike again&s;t the Net, and are there entangled.</P>
<P>There is a kind of Locu&s;t in <HI>Tonquin,</HI> in great abundance. This Creature is about the bigne&s;s of the top of a Mans Finger, and as long as the fir&s;t joynt. It breeds in the Earth, e&s;pecially in the Banks of Rivers and Ditches in the low Country. In the months of <HI>January</HI> and <HI>February,</HI> which is the &s;ea&s;on of taking them, being then only &s;een, this Creature fir&s;t comes out of the Earth in huge
<PB N="27" REF="35">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> &s;warms. It is then of a whiti&s;h colour, having 2 &s;mall Wings, like the Wings of a Bee: at its fir&s;t coming out of the Earth it takes its flight; but for want of &s;trength or u&s;e falls down again in a &s;hort time. Such as &s;trive to fly over the River, do com|monly fall down into the Water and are drowned, or become a prey to the Fi&s;h of the River, or are carried out into the Sea to be devoured there: But the Natives in the&s;e Months watch the Rivers, and take up thence Multitudes, &s;kimming them from off the Water with little Nets. They eat them fre&s;h, broiled on the Coals; or pickle them to keep. They are plump and fat, and are much e&s;teemed both by rich and poor, as good whole&s;ome food, either fre&s;h or pickled.</P>
<P>The Rivers and Ponds are &s;tored with divers &s;orts of excellent Fi&s;h, be&s;ides abundance of Frogs, which they angle for, being highly e&s;teemed by the <HI>Tonquine&s;e.</HI> The Sea too contributes much to|wards the &s;upport of poor People, by yielding plentiful &s;tores of Fi&s;h, that &s;warm on this Coa&s;t in their &s;ea&s;ons, and which are commonly pre|ferr'd before the River Fi&s;h. Of the&s;e here are divers &s;orts, be&s;ides Sea Turtle, which frequently come a&s;hore on the &s;andy Bays in their &s;ea&s;ons to lay their Eggs. Here are al&s;o both Land-crabs and Sea-crabs good &s;tore, and other Shell-fi&s;h, <HI>viz.</HI> Craw-fi&s;h, Shrimps, and Prawns. Here is one &s;ort of &s;mall Fi&s;h much like an <HI>Anchovy,</HI> both in &s;hape and &s;ize, which is very good pickled. There are other &s;orts of &s;mall Fi&s;h, which I know not the names of. One &s;ort of them comes in great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hoals near the &s;hore, and the&s;e the Fi&s;hermen with their Nets take &s;o plentifully as to load their Boats with them. Among the&s;e they generally take a great many Shrimps in their Nets, which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">arry a&s;hore mixt together as they take them, and make <HI>Balachaun</HI> with them.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="36">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> <HI>Balachaun</HI> is a compo&s;ition of a &s;trong favour; yet a very delight&s;om Di&s;h to the Natives of this Country. To make it, they throw the mixture of Shrimps and &s;mall Fi&s;h into a &s;ort of weak pickle made with Salt and Water, and put it into a tight earthen Ve&s;&s;el or Jar. The pickle being thus weak, it keeps not the Fi&s;h firm and hard, neither is it probably &s;o de&s;igned, for the Fi&s;h are never gutted. Therefore in a &s;hort time they turn all to a ma&s;h in the Ve&s;&s;el; and when they have lain thus a good while, &s;o that the Fi&s;h is reduced to a Pap, they then draw off the Liquor into fre&s;h Jars, and pre&s;erve it for u&s;e. The ma&s;ht Fi&s;h that remains behind is called <HI>Balachaun,</HI> and the liquor pour'd off is called <HI>Nuke-mum.</HI> The poor People eat the <HI>Balachaun</HI> with their Rice. 'Tis rank &s;cented, yet the ta&s;te is not altogether unplea&s;ant; but rather &s;avory, after one is a little u&s;ed to it. The <HI>Nuke-mum</HI> is of a pale brown colour, inclining to grey; and pretty clear. It is al&s;o very &s;avory and u&s;ed as a good &s;auce for Fowls, not only by the Natives, but al&s;o by many <HI>Europeans,</HI> who e&s;teem it equal with <HI>Soy.</HI> I have been told that <HI>Soy</HI> is made partly with a fi&s;hy compo&s;ition, and it &s;eems mo&s;t likely by the ta&s;te: tho a Gentleman of my acquaintance, who was very intimate with one that &s;ailed often from <HI>Tonquin</HI> to <HI>Japan,</HI> from whence the true <HI>Soy</HI> comes, told me, that it was made only with Wheat, and a &s;ort of Beans mixt with Water and Salt.</P>
<P>Their way of Fi&s;hing differs little from ours: in the Rivers they take &s;ome of their Fi&s;h with Hook and Line, others with Nets of &s;everal &s;orts. At the Mouths of the Rivers they &s;et Nets again&s;t the Stream or Tide.

Farther up the River, they have Nets made &s;quare like a great &s;heet. This &s;ort hath two long Poles laid acro&s;s each other. At this cro&s;&s;ing of the Poles a long Rope is fa&s;tned; and the Net hangs down in a bag by its corners from them. To manage it there is a &s;ub&s;tantial po&s;t, &s;et upright and firm in the Ri|ver; and the top of it may be 8 or 10 foot above the water. On the top of this po&s;t there is a Mortice made to receive a long pole, that lies athwart like the Beam of a Balance: to the heavier end of which they tie the Rope, which holds the Net; and to the other end another Rope to pull up the Net on occa&s;ion. The Fi&s;hermen &s;ink it with Stones to the Rivers bottom, and when they &s;ee any Fi&s;h come over it, one &s;uddenly pulls the Rope at the oppo&s;ite end of the Beam, and heaves Net and Fi&s;h out of the Water.

<P>In the &s;tagnant Ponds, &s;uch as the <HI>Mandarins</HI> have commonly about their Hou&s;es, they go in and trouble the water with their feet, till 'tis all mud|dy and thick: and as the Fi&s;h ri&s;e to the furface they take what they plea&s;e with &s;mall Nets, fa&s;tned to a hoop, at the end of a pole.</P>

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> For all the&s;e &s;orts of provi&s;ion there are Markets duly kept all over <HI>Tonquin</HI> one in the week, in a neighbourhood of 4 or 5 Villages; and held at each of them &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in its order: &s;o that the &s;ame Village has not the Market returned to it till 4 or 5 weeks after. The&s;e Markets are abundantly more &s;tor'd with Rice (as being their chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, e&s;pecially of the poorer &s;ort) than either with Fle&s;h or Fi&s;h, yet wants there not for Pork, and young Pigs good &s;tore, Ducks and Hens, plenty of Eggs, Fi&s;h great and &s;mall, fre&s;h and &s;alted <HI>Balachaun</HI> and <HI>Nuke-Mum;</HI> with all &s;orts of Roots, Herbs, and Fruits, even in the&s;e Country Markets. But at <HI>Cachao,</HI> where there are Markets kept every day, they have be&s;ides the&s;e, Beef of Bullocks, Buffa|loes Fle&s;h, Goats Fle&s;h, Hor&s;e Fle&s;h, Cats and Dogs, (as I have been told) and Locu&s;ts.</P>
<P>They dre&s;s their food very cleanly, and make &s;avory: for which they have &s;everal ways un|known in <HI>Europe;</HI> but they have many &s;orts of di&s;hes, that would turn the Stomach of a Stranger, which yet they them&s;elves like very well, as par|ticularly, a di&s;h of raw Pork, which is very cheap and common. This is only Pork cut and minced very &s;mall, fat and lean together; which being afterwards made up in balls, or rolls like Sau&s;ages, and pre&s;t very hard together, is then neatly wrapt up in clean Leaves, and without more ado, &s;erved up to the Table. Raw Beef is another di&s;h, much e&s;teemed at <HI>Cachao.</HI> When they kill a Bullock they &s;inge the hair off with Fire, as we &s;inge Bacon-Hogs in <HI>England.</HI> Then they open it; and while the Fle&s;h is yet hot, they cut good Collops from off the lean parts, and put them into a very tart Vine|gar, where it remains 3 or 4 hours longer, till it is &s;ufficiently &s;oaked, and then, without more trouble, they take it out, and eat it with great delight. As for Hor&s;e-fle&s;h, I know not whether
<PB N="31" REF="39">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> they kill any purpo&s;ely for the Shambles; or whe|ther they only do it, when they are not likely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o live; as I have &s;een them do their working Bullocks at <HI>Galicia</HI> in <HI>Old Spain;</HI> where the Cattel falling down with labour, and being &s;o poor and tired that they cannot ri&s;e, they are &s;laughtered, and &s;ent to Market; and I think I never eat wor&s;e Beef than at the <HI>Groin.</HI> The Hor&s;e-fle&s;h comes to Market at <HI>Cachao</HI> very frequently, and is as much e&s;teemed as Beef. Elephants they eat al&s;o; and the Trunk of this Bea&s;t is an acceptable pre&s;ent for a Nobleman, and that too tho' the Bea&s;t dyes with Age or Sickne&s;s. For here are but few wild Elephants, and tho&s;e &s;o &s;hy, that they are not ea&s;ily taken. But the King having a great number of tame Elephants, when one of the&s;e dyes, 'tis given to the poor, who pre&s;ently fetch away the Fle&s;h, but the Trunk is cut in pieces, and pre&s;ented to the <HI>Mandarins.</HI> Dogs and Cats are killed purpo&s;e|ly for the Shambles, and their Fle&s;h is much e|&s;teemed by people of the be&s;t fa&s;hion, as I have been credibly informed. Great yellow Frogs al&s;o are much admired, e&s;pecially when they come fre&s;h out of the Pond. They have many other &s;uch choice di&s;hes: and in all the Villages, at any time of the day, be it Market day or not, there are &s;everal to be &s;old by poor people, who make it their Trade. The mo&s;t common &s;orts of Cookeries, next to boiled Rice, is to dre&s;s little bits of Pork, &s;pitted 5 or 6 of them at once on a &s;mall &s;kiver, and roa&s;ted. In the Markets al&s;o, and daily in every Village, there are Women &s;itting in the Streets, with a Pipkin over a &s;mall Fire, full of <HI>Chau,</HI> as they call it, a &s;ort of very ordinary Tea, of a reddi&s;h brown colour, and 'tis their ordinary drink.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Tonquin</HI> is in general healthy enough, e&s;pecially in the dry &s;ea&s;on, when al&s;o it is very delight&s;om. For the &s;ea&s;ons of the year
<PB N="32" REF="40">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> at <HI>Tonquin</HI> and all the Countries between the <HI>Tro|picks,</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed into Wet and Dry, as pro|perly as others are into Winter and Summer: But as the alteration from Winter to Summer, and <HI>vice ver&s;a</HI> is not made of a &s;udden, but with the interchangeable Weather of Spring and Autumn; &s;o al&s;o towards the end of the dry &s;ea&s;on, there are &s;ome gentle &s;howers now and then, that precede the violent wet months; and again toward the end of the&s;e, &s;everal fair days that introduce the dry time. The&s;e &s;ea&s;ons are generally much alike at the &s;ame time of the year in all places of the Torrid Zone, on the &s;ame &s;ide of the <HI>Equator:</HI> but for 2 or 3 degrees on each &s;ide of it, the weather is more mixt and uncertain, (tho' inclining to the wet extreme) and is often contrary to that which is then &s;ettled on the &s;ame &s;ide of the <HI>Equator</HI> more toward the Tropick. So that even when the wet &s;ea&s;on is &s;et in, in the Northern parts of the Torrid Zone, it may yet be dry weather for 2 or 3 degrees North of the Line: and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of the con|trary Latitudes and Sea&s;ons. This I &s;peak with re&s;pect to the dryne&s;s or moi&s;ture of Countries in the Torrid Zone: but it may al&s;o hold good of their Heat or Cold, generally: for as to all the&s;e qualities there is a further difference ari&s;es from the make or &s;ituation of the Land, or other acciden|tal cau&s;es, be&s;ides what depends on the re&s;pective latitude or regard to the Sun. Thus the Bay of <HI>Campeachy</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and that of <HI>Bengal</HI> in the Ea&s;t, in much the &s;ame latitude, are ex|ceeding hot and moi&s;t; and whether their &s;itua|tion, being very low Countries, and the &s;carcity and faintne&s;s of the Sea-breezes, as in mo&s;t Bays, may not contribute hereunto, I leave others to judge. Yet even as to the Latitudes of the&s;e places, lying near the Tropicks, they are generally upon that account alone more inclined to great Heats,
<PB N="33" REF="41">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> than places near the Equator. This is what I have experienc'd in many places in &s;uch Latitudes both in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>West-Indies,</HI> that the hotte&s;t parts of the World are the&s;e near the Tropicks, e&s;pecially 3 or 4 Degrees within them; &s;en&s;ibly hotter than under the Line it &s;elf. Many rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;ign'd for this, be&s;ide the accidental ones from the make of the particular Countries, Tropical Winds, or the like. For the longe&s;t day at the Equator never exceeds 12 Hours, and the Night is always of the &s;ame length: But near the Tropicks the longe&s;t day is about 13 hours and an half; and an hour and an half being al&s;o taken from the Night, what with the length of the day, and the &s;hortne&s;s of the night, there is a difference of three hours: which is very con&s;iderable. Be|&s;ides which, at &s;uch places as are about 3 Degrees within the Tropicks, or in the Lat. of 20 Deg. N. the Sun comes within 2 or 3 degrees of the Ze|nith in the beginning of <HI>May;</HI> and having pa&s;t the Zenith, goes not above 2 or 3 degrees beyond it, before it returns and pa&s;&s;eth the Zenith once more; and by this means is at lea&s;t 3 Months within 4 degrees of the Zenith: &s;o that they have the Sun in a manner over their Heads from the be|ginning of <HI>May,</HI> till the latter end of <HI>July.</HI> Where|as when the Sun comes under the Line, in <HI>March</HI> or <HI>September,</HI> it immediately po&s;ts away to the North or the South, and is not 20 days in pa&s;&s;ing from 3 degrees on one &s;ide, to 3 degrees on the other &s;ide the Line. So that by his &s;mall &s;tay there, the heat cannot be an&s;werable to what it is near the Tropick, where he &s;o long continues in a manner Vertical at Noon, and is &s;o much longer above the Horrizon each particular day, with the intervening of a &s;horter Night.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Tonquin.</HI> During the wet Months there 'tis exce&s;&s;ive hot, e&s;pecially when|ever
<PB N="34" REF="42">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> the Sun breaks out of the Clouds, and there is then but little Wind &s;tirring: And I have been told by a Gentleman who lived there many Years, that he thought it was the hotte&s;t place that ever he was in, tho' he had been in many other parts of <HI>India.</HI> And as to the Rains, it has not the lea&s;t &s;hare of them, tho' neither altogether the greate&s;t of what I have met with in the Torrid Zone; and even in the &s;ame Latitude, and on the &s;ame &s;ide of the Equator. The wet Sea&s;on begins here the lat|ter end of <HI>April,</HI> or the beginning of <HI>May;</HI> and holds till the latter end of <HI>August,</HI> in which time are very violent Rains, &s;ome of many hours, others of two or three Days continuance. Yet are not the&s;e Rains without &s;ome con&s;iderable intervals of fair Weather, e&s;pecially toward the beginning or end of the Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Rains are caus'd tho&s;e Land-floods, which never fail in the&s;e Countries between the Tropicks at their annual Periods; all the Rivers then overflowing their Banks. This is a thing &s;o well known to all who are any way acquainted with the Torrid Zone, that the cau&s;e of the over|flowing of the <HI>Nile,</HI> to find out which the Ancients &s;et their Wits &s;o much upon the Rack, and fancied melting of Snows, and blowing of <HI>Ete&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and I know not what, is now no longer a &s;ecret.

They might have made the &s;ame wonderment of any other Rivers which run any long cour&s;e from out the Torrid Zone: but they knowing only the North Temperate Zone, and the <HI>Nile</HI> being the only great River known to come thither a great way from a Country near the Line, they made that only the &s;ubject of their enquiry: but the &s;ame effect mu&s;t al&s;o follow from any great River that &s;hould run from out of the Torrid Zone into the South Temperate Zone. And as to the Torrid Zone, the yearly Floods, and their cau&s;e, are every where as well known by People there, as the Rivers them&s;elves. In <HI>America</HI> parti|cularly, in <HI>Campeachy</HI> Rivers, in <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> and others, 'tis a va&s;t havock is made by the&s;e Floods; bringing down &s;ometimes Trees of an incredible bigne&s;s; and the&s;e floods always come at the &s;tated &s;ea&s;on of the Year. In the dry part of <HI>Peru,</HI> along the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Pacifick</HI> Sea, where it never rains, as it &s;eldom does in <HI>Egypt,</HI> they have not only Floods, but Rivers them&s;elves, made by the annual falling of Rain on the Mountains within Land; the Channels of which are dry all the re&s;t of the year. This I have ob&s;erv'd concerning the River <HI>Ylo,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru,</HI> in my former Volume, p. 95. But it has this difference from the Floods of <HI>Egypt,</HI> that be&s;ides its being a River in the Torrid Zone, 'tis al&s;o in South Latitude, and &s;o overflows at a contrary &s;ea&s;on of the Year; to wit, at &s;uch time as the Sun being in Southern Signs, cau&s;es the Rains and Floods on that &s;ide the Line.</P>
<P>But to eeturn from this digre&s;&s;ion, in <HI>August</HI> the weather at <HI>Tonquin</HI> is more moderate, as to heat or wet, yet not without &s;ome &s;howers, and <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October</HI> are more temperate &s;till: yet the wor&s;t weather in all the year for Seamen, is in one of the 3 Months la&s;t mentioned: for then the violent Storms, called <HI>Tuffoons, (Typhones)</HI> are ex|pected.
<PB N="36" REF="44">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> The&s;e Winds are &s;o very fierce, that for fear of them the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> that trade thither, will not &s;tir out of Harbour till the end of <HI>October:</HI> after which Month there is no more danger of any violent Storms, till the next year.</P>
<P><HI>Tuffoons</HI> are a particular kind of violent Storms, blowing on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> and the neighbour|ing Coa&s;ts in the Months of <HI>July, Augu&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Sep|tember.</HI> They commonly happen near the full or change of the Moon, and are u&s;ually preceded by very fair weather, &s;mall Winds and a clear Sky.

This Cloud appears very amazing and gha&s;tly, and is &s;ometimes &s;een 12 Hours before the Storm comes. When that Cloud begins to move apace, you may expect the Wind pre&s;ently. It comes on fierce, and blows very vio|lent at N. E. 12 Hours more or le&s;s. It is al&s;o com|monly accompanied with terrible claps of Thunder, large and frequent fla&s;hes of Lightning, and exce&s;|&s;ive hard Rain.

<P><HI>November</HI> and <HI>December</HI> are 2 very dry, whole&s;om, warm and plea&s;ant months. <HI>January, February,</HI> and <HI>March</HI> are pretty dry: but then you have thick fogs in the morning, and &s;ometimes dri&s;ling cold rains: the air al&s;o in the&s;e 3 months, particularly in <HI>January</HI> and <HI>February</HI> is very &s;harp, e&s;pecially

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> when the wind is at North Ea&s;t, or North North Ea&s;t, whether becau&s;e of the Quarter it blows from, or the Land it blows over I know not: for I have el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved &s;uch Winds to be cold|er, where they have come from over Land. <HI>April</HI> is counted a moderate month, either as to heat or cold, drine&s;s or moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>This is ordinarily the &s;tate of their year: yet are not the&s;e various Sea&s;ons &s;o exact in the returns, but that there may &s;ometimes be the difference of a month, or more. Neither yet are the &s;everal Sea&s;ons, when they do come, altogether alike in all years. For &s;ometimes the Rains are more violent and la&s;ting, at other times more mode|rate; and &s;ome years they are not &s;ufficient to pro|duce rea&s;onable Crops, or el&s;e they come &s;o un&s;ea|&s;onably as to injure and de&s;troy the Rice, or at lea&s;t to advance it but little. For the Husbandry of this Country, and other Countreys in the Torrid Zone depends on the Annual Floods, to moi&s;ten and fatten the Land, and if the wet &s;ea&s;ons prove more dry than ordinary, &s;o as that the Rice-Land is not well dranched with the overflowing of the Rivers, the Crops will be but mean: and Rice being their Bread, the &s;taff of Life with them, if that fails, &s;uch a populous Country as this cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out being beholding to its Neighbours. But when it comes to that pa&s;s, that they mu&s;t be &s;upplied by Sea, many of the poorer &s;ort &s;ell their Children to relieve their wants, and &s;o pre&s;erve their Lives, whil&s;t others that have not Children to &s;ell, may be fami&s;hed and dye mi&s;erable in the Streets. This manner of Parents dealing with their Children is not peculiar to this Kingdom alone, but is cu&s;to|mary in other places of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> e&s;pecially on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Malabar</HI> and <HI>Coromandel.</HI> There a famine happens more frequently, and rages &s;ome|times to a degree beyond belief: for tho&s;e Coun|tries
<PB N="38" REF="46">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> are generally very dry, and le&s;s productive of Rice than <HI>Tonquin.</HI> Neither are they &s;uch large Rivers to fatten the Land: but all their Crop de|pends on Sea&s;ons of Rains only, to moi&s;ten the earth: and when tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons fail, as they do very often, then they can have no Crop at all. Sometimes they have little or no rain in three or fore years, and then they peri&s;h at a la|mentable rate. Such a Famine as this hapned 2 or 3 years before my going to <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> which raged &s;o &s;ore, that thou&s;ands of people peri&s;hed for want, and happy were they that could hold out till they got to the Sea-port Towns, where the <HI>Europeans</HI> lived, to &s;ell them&s;elves to them, tho' they were &s;ure to be tran&s;ported from their own Coun|try pre&s;ently. But the famine does never rage &s;o much at <HI>Tonquin,</HI> neither may their greate&s;t &s;car|city be &s;o truly called a famine: for in the wor&s;t of times there is Rice, and 'tis thro' the poverty of the meaner people, that &s;o many peri&s;h or &s;ell their Children, for they might el&s;e have Rice enough, had they money to buy it with: and when their Rice is thus dear, all other provi&s;ions are &s;o proportionably.</P>
<P>There is a further difference between the Coun|tries of <HI>Malabar</HI> and <HI>Coromandel,</HI> and this of <HI>Ton|quin,</HI> that the more Rain they have there, the greater is their ble&s;&s;ing: but here they may have too much rain for the lower part of the Kingdom; but that is rare. When this happens they have Banks to keep in the Rivers, and Ditches to drain the Land; tho' &s;ometimes to little purpo&s;e, when the floods are violent, and e&s;pecially if out of &s;ea|&s;on. For if the floods come in their &s;ea&s;ons, tho' they are great, and drown all the Land, yet are they not hurtful; but on the contrary, very beneficial, becau&s;e the mud that they leave behind fattens the Land. And after all, if the low Land
<PB N="39" REF="47">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> &s;hould be injured by the floods, the dry Champion Land yields the better increa&s;e, and helps out the other; as that does them al&s;o in more kindly &s;ea&s;ons. In the dry &s;ea&s;ons the low Lands have this ad|vantage, that Channels are ea&s;ily cut out of the River, to water them on each &s;ide. So that let the Sea&s;ons be wet or dry this Country &s;eldom &s;uffers much. Indeed con&s;idering the Number of its inha|bitants, and the poverty of the Major part, it is &s;ometimes here, as in all populous Countries, very hard with the poor, e&s;pecially the Trades-people in the large Towns. For the Trade is very uncer|tain, and the people are imployed according to the number of Ships that come thither, to fetch away their Goods: and if but few Ships come hither, as &s;ometimes it happens, then the poor are ready to fami&s;h for want of work, whereby to get a &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance. And not only this, but mo&s;t Silk Coun|tries are &s;tockt with great multitudes of poor peo|ple, who work cheap and live meanly on a little Rice; which if it is not very cheap, as it com|monly is here, the poor people are not able to maintain them&s;elves.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>TOnquin</HI> is very populous, being thick &s;et with Villages; and the Natives in general are of a middle &s;tature, and clean limb'd. They are of a Tawny <HI>Indian</HI> colour: but I think the faire&s;t and cleare&s;t that I ever &s;aw of that Complexion: for you may perceive a blu&s;h or change of colour in &s;ome of their faces, on any &s;udden &s;urprize of pa&s;&s;ion; which I could never di&s;cern in any other <HI>Indians.</HI> Their faces are generally flatti&s;h, and of an oval form. Their no&s;es and lips are proportio|nable enough, and altogether graceful. Their hair is black, long and lank, and very thick; and they wear it hanging down to their &s;houlders.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="49">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> Their teeth are as black as they can make them; for this being accounted a great ornament, they dye them of that colour, and are 3 or 4 days doing it. They do this when they are about 12 or 14 years old, both Boys and Girls: and during all the time of the operation they dare not take any nou|ri&s;hment, be&s;ides Water, Chau, or &s;ome liquid thing, and not much of that neither, for fear, I judge, of being poy&s;on'd by the Dye, or Pig|ment. So that while this is doing they undergo very &s;evere Penance: but as both Sexes, &s;o all Qualities, the poor as well as the rich, mu&s;t be in this fa&s;hion: they &s;ay they &s;hould el&s;e be like Brutes; and that would be a great &s;hame to them to be like Elephants or Dogs; which they compare tho&s;e to that have white teeth.</P>
<P>They are generally dextrous, nimble, and active; and ingenious in any Mechannick Science they pro|fe&s;s. This may be &s;een by the multitude of fine Silks that are made here; and the curious Lacker|work, that is yearly tran&s;ported from thence. They are al&s;o laborious and diligent in their Cal|lings; but the Country being &s;o very populous, many of them are extreme poor for want of em|ployment: and tho' the Country is full of Silk, and other materials to work on, yet little is done, but when &s;trange Ships arrive. For 'tis the Money and goods that are brought hither, e&s;pecially by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> that puts life into them: for the Handicrafts men have not Money to &s;et them&s;elves to work; and the Foreign Merchants are therefore forced to tru&s;t them with advance|money, to the value of at lea&s;t a third, or half their goods; and this for 2 or 3 months or more, before they have made their Goods, and brought them in. So that they having no Goods ready by them, till they have Money from the Merchant &s;trangers, the Ships that trade hither mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> &s;tay here all the time that their Goods are making, which are commonly 5 or 6 months.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> make very good Servants; I think the be&s;t in <HI>India.</HI> For as they are generally apprehen&s;ive and do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">il, &s;o are they faithful when hired, diligent and obedient. Yet they are low &s;pirited: probably by rea&s;on of their living under an Arbitrary Government. They are patient in labour, but in &s;ickne&s;s they are mightily dejected. They have one great fault extreme common among them, which is gaming. To this they are &s;o uni|ver&s;ally addicted, Servants and all, that neither the awe of their Ma&s;ters, nor any thing el&s;e, is &s;uf|ficient to re&s;train them, till they have lo&s;t all they have, even their very Cloaths. This is a reigning Vice among the Ea&s;tern Nations, e&s;pecially the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> as I &s;aid in the 15th Chaper of my former Volume. And I may add, that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> I found &s;ettled at <HI>Tonquin,</HI> were no le&s;s given to it than tho&s;e I met with el&s;ewhere. For after they have lo&s;t their Money, Goods and Cloaths, they will &s;take down their Wives and Children: and la&s;tly, as the deare&s;t thing they have, will play upon tick, and mortgage their Hair upon honour: And whatever it co&s;t 'em they will be &s;ure to redeem it. For a free <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> as the&s;e are, who have fled from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> would be as much a&s;hamed of &s;hort Hair, as a <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> of white Teeth.</P>
<P>The Cloaths of the <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> are made either of Silk or Cotton. The poor people and Soldiers do chiefly were Cotton Cloath died to a dark tawny colour. The rich men and <HI>Mandarins</HI> commonly were Engli&s;h Broad-cloath: the chief colours are red or green. When they appear before the King, they wear long Gowns which reach down to their heels: neither may any man appear in his pre|&s;ence but in &s;uch a garb. The great men have al&s;o long Caps made of the &s;ame that their Gowns
<PB N="43" REF="51">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> are made of: but the middle &s;ort of men and the poor commonly go bare-headed. Yet the Fi&s;her|men, and &s;uch labourers as are by their employ|ments more expo&s;ed to the weather, have broad|brimm'd Hats, made of Reeds, Straw, or Palmeto|leaves. The&s;e Hats are as &s;tiff as boards, and &s;it not plyant to their heads: for which rea&s;on they have Band&s;trings or Necklaces fa&s;tned to their Hats; which coming under their chins are there tyed, to keep their Hats fa&s;t to their Heads. The&s;e Hats are very ordinary things; they &s;eldom wear them but in rainy weather. Their other Cloaths are very few and mean: a ragged pair of Britches commonly &s;ufficeth them. Some have bad Jackets, but neither Shirt, Stockings nor Shooes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> buildings are but mean. Their Hou&s;es are &s;mall and low: the Walls are either Mud, or Watle bedawbed over: and the Roofs are thatched, and that very ill, e&s;pecially in the Country. The Hou&s;es are too low to admit of Chambers: yet they have here 2 or 3 partitions on the ground floor, made with a watling of Canes or Sticks, for their &s;everal u&s;es; in each of which there is a Window to let in the light. The Win|dows are only &s;mall &s;quare holes in the Walls, which they &s;hut up at night with a Board, fitted for that purpo&s;e. The Rooms are but meanly fur|ni&s;hed; with a poor Bed or two (or more, accord|ing to the bigne&s;s of the family) in the inner Room. The outer Rooms are furni&s;hed with Stools, Benches, or Chairs to &s;it on. There is al&s;o a Ta|ble, and on one &s;ide a little Altar, with two In|cen&s;e-pots on it; nor is any Hou&s;e without its Altar. One of the&s;e Incen&s;e-pots has a &s;mall bun|dle of Ru&s;hes in it; the ends of which I always took notice had been burnt, and the fire put out. This outer Room is the place where they common|ly dre&s;s their food: yet in fair weather they do it
<PB N="44" REF="52">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> as frequently in the open air, at their doors, or in their yards; as being thereby the le&s;s incommoded by heat or &s;moak.</P>
<P>They dwell not in lone hou&s;es, but together in Villages: 'tis rare to &s;ee a &s;ingle hou&s;e by it &s;elf. The Country Villages commonly con&s;i&s;t of 20, 30, or 40 hou&s;es, and are thick &s;eated over all the Country; yet hardly to be be &s;een till you come to their very doors, by rea&s;on of the Trees and Groves they are &s;urrounded with. And 'tis as rare to &s;ee a Grove without a Village, in the low Coun|try near the Sea, as to &s;ee a Village without a Grove: but the high Lands are full of Woods, and the Villages there &s;tand all as in one great Fore&s;t. The Villages and Land about them do mo&s;t belong to great men, and the Inhabitants are Tenants that manure and cultivate the ground.</P>
<P>The Villages in the low Land are al&s;o &s;urround|ed with great banks and deep ditches. The&s;e in|compa&s;s the whole Grove, in which each Village &s;tands.</P>
<P>The banks are to keep the water from over|flowing their gardens, and from coming into their hou&s;es in the wet time, when all the Land about them is under water, 2 or 3 foot deep. The ditches or trenches are to pre&s;erve the water in the dry time, with which they water their gardens when need requires. Every man lets water at plea&s;ure, by little drains that run inward from the Town|ditch, into his own garden; and u&s;ually each mans yard or garden is parted from his neighbours by one of the&s;e little drains on each &s;ide. The hou&s;es lie &s;cattering up and down in the Grove; no where joyning to one another, but each apart, and fenced in with a &s;mall hedge. Every hou&s;e hath a &s;mall gate or &s;tile to enter into the garden fir&s;t, for the hou&s;e &s;tands in the middle of it: and the gardens runs al&s;o from the back&s;ide of the hou&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="53">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> to the Town-Ditch, with its drain and hedge on each &s;ide. In the Gardens every Man has his own Fruit-trees, as Oranges, Limes, Betle; his Pumpkins, Melons, Pine-apples, and a great many Herbs. In the dry &s;ea&s;on the&s;e Grovy dwellings are very plea&s;ant; but in the wet &s;ea&s;on they are altoge|ther uncomfortable: for tho' fenced in thus with banks, yet are they like &s;o many Duck-hou&s;es all wet and dirt: neither can they pa&s;s from one Village to another, but Mid-leg or to their Knees in Water, unle&s;s &s;ometimes in Boats, which they keep for this purpo&s;e: But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e, they are &s;eldom out of mire and wet, even in the mid&s;t of the Village or Garden, &s;o long as that &s;ea&s;on la&s;ts. The Inhabitants of the higher part of the Kingdom are not troubled with &s;uch incon|veniences, but live more cleanly and comfortably, fora&s;much as their Land is never overflown with water: and tho' they live al&s;o in Villages or Towns as the former, yet they have no occa&s;ion to &s;ur|round them with banks or trenches, but lie open to the Fore&s;t.</P>
<P>The Capital City <HI>Cachao,</HI> which &s;tands in the high Country about 80 Miles from the Sea, on the We&s;t &s;ide of the River, and on a pretty level, yet ri&s;ing Ground, lies open in the &s;ame manner, with|out wall, bank, or ditch. There may be in <HI>Cachao</HI> about 20000 Hou&s;es. The Hou&s;es are generally low, the walls of the Hou&s;es are of mud, and the covering Thatch, yet &s;ome are built with Brick, and the covering with Pan-tile. Mo&s;t of the&s;e Hou&s;es have a Yard, or Back-&s;ide belonging to them. In each Yard, you &s;hall &s;ee a &s;mall arched building made &s;omewhat like an Oven, about &s;ix foot high, with the Mouth on the Ground. It is built from top to bottom with brick, all over daub'd thick with mud and dirt. If any Hou&s;e wants a yard, they have neverthele&s;s &s;uch a kind of Oven as this, but
<PB N="46" REF="54">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> &s;maller, &s;et up in the middle of the Hou&s;e it &s;elf; and there is &s;carce a Hou&s;e in the City without one. The u&s;e of it is to thru&s;t their chiefe&s;t Goods into when a Fire happens: for the&s;e low thatch'd Hou&s;es are very &s;ubject to take fire, e&s;pe|cially in the dry times, to the De&s;truction of many Hou&s;es in an in&s;tant, that often they have &s;carce time to &s;ecure their Goods in the arched Ovens, tho' &s;o near them.</P>
<P>As every private Per&s;on hath this contrivance, to &s;ecure his own Goods, when a Fire happens, &s;o the Government hath carefully ordered nece&s;&s;ary means to be u&s;ed for the preventing of Fire, or extingui&s;hing it before it gets too great a Head. For in the beginning of the dry Sea&s;on every Man mu&s;t keep a great Jar of Water, on the top of his Hou&s;e, to be ready to pour down, as occa&s;ion &s;hall &s;erve. Be&s;ides this, he is to keep a long Pole, with a Ba&s;ket or Bowl at the end of it, to throw Water out of the Kennels upon the Hou&s;es. But if the Fire gets to &s;uch a head, that both the&s;e ex|pedients fail, then they cut the Straps that hold the Thatch of the Hou&s;es, and let it drop from the Rafters to the Ground. This is done with little trouble; for the Thatch is not laid on as ours, nei|ther is it tyed on by &s;ingle Leaves, as in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and many parts of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> where they Thatch with <HI>Palmeto</HI> or Palm-tree Leaves: but this is made up in Panes of 7 or 8 foot &s;quare, before it is laid on; &s;o that 4 or 6 Panes, more or le&s;s, accord|ing to the bigne&s;s of the Hou&s;e, will cover one &s;ide of it: and the&s;e Panes being only fa&s;tned in a few places to the Rafters with Rattans, they are ea|&s;ily cut, and down drops half the covering at once. The&s;e Panes are al&s;o better than loo&s;e Thatch, as being more managable, in ca&s;e any of them &s;hould fall on or near the Oven where the Goods are, for they are ea&s;ily dragg'd off to another
<PB N="47" REF="55">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> place. The neighbouring Hou&s;es may this way be &s;oon uncovered, before the Flame comes to 'em; and the Thatch either carried away, or at lea&s;t laid where it may burn by it &s;elf. And for this purpo&s;e every Man is ordered to keep a long Pole or Bambo at his Door, with a Cutting-hook at the end of it, purpo&s;ely for uncovering the Hou&s;es: and if any Man is found without his Jar upon the Hou&s;e, and his Bucket-Pole and long Hook at his Door, he will be puni&s;h'd &s;everely for his neglect. They are rigorous in exacting this: for even with all this caution they are much and often damaged by Fire.</P>
<P>The principal Streets in this City are very wide, tho' &s;ome are but narrow. They are mo&s;t of them pav'd, or pitch'd rather, with &s;mall Stones; but after a very ill manner. In the wet Sea&s;on they are very dirty; and in the dry time there are ma|ny &s;tagnant Ponds, and &s;ome Ditches full of black &s;tinking Mud, in and about the City. This makes it unplea&s;ant, and a Man would think unwhole|&s;ome too: yet it is healthy enough, as far as I per|ceiv'd, or could ever learn.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> who make this City their con&s;tant Re&s;idence, have two or three Pa|laces in it, &s;uch as they be. Two of them are very mean; they are built with Timber, yet have they many great Guns planted in Hou&s;es near them, Stables for the Kings Elephants and Hor&s;es, and pretty large &s;quare &s;pots of Ground for the Soldiers to draw them&s;elves up regularly before him. The Third Palace is called the Palace Royal. It is more magnificently built than the other two: yet built al&s;o with Timber, but all open as the Divans in <HI>Turky</HI> are &s;aid to be. The Wall that in|compa&s;&s;eth it is mo&s;t remarkable. It is &s;aid to be 3 leagues in circumference. The heigth of this Wall is about 15 or 16 foot, and almo&s;t as many
<PB N="48" REF="56">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> broad or thick. It is faced up on both &s;ides with Brick: there are &s;everal &s;mall Gates to go in and out at, but the main Gate faceth to the City. This they &s;ay is never opened, but when the <HI>Boua</HI> or Emperor goes in or comes out. There are two &s;maller Gates adjoyning to it, one on each &s;ide, which are opened on all occa&s;ions, for any con|cerned there to pa&s;s in and out; but Strangers are not permitted this liberty. Yet they may a&s;cend to the top of the Wall, and walk round it, there being Stairs at the Gate to go up by: and in &s;ome places the Walls are fallen down.</P>
<P>Within this Wall there are large Fi&s;h-ponds, where al&s;o there are Plea&s;ure-Boats for the Empe|ror's diver&s;ion. I &s;hall defer &s;peaking of him, who&s;e Pri&s;on this is, rather than Court, till the next Chapter, where I &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e of the Go|vernment.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory, who are very few, is plea&s;antly &s;eated on the North end of the City, fronting to the River. 'Tis a pretty hand|&s;om low-built Hou&s;e; the be&s;t that I &s;aw in the City. There is a hand&s;ome Dining-room in the middle, and at each end convenient Apartments for the Merchants, Factors, and Servants belong|ing to the Company to live in, with other conve|niences. This Hou&s;e &s;tands parallel with the Ri|ver; and at each end of it there are &s;maller Hou&s;es for other u&s;es, as Kitchin, Store-Hou&s;es, &amp;c. run|ning in a Line from the great Hou&s;e towards the River, making two Wings, and a &s;quare Court open to the River. In this &s;quare &s;pace, near the Banks of the River, there &s;tands a Flag Staff, purpo&s;ely for the hoy&s;ing up the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours on all occa&s;ions: for it is the cu&s;tom of our Coun|trymen aboard, to let fly their Colours on <HI>Sundays,</HI> and all other remarkable Days.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="57">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> The <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory joins to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory on the South &s;ide: I was never in it, and therefore can &s;ay nothing of it, but what I have heard, that their ground is not &s;o large as ours, tho' they are the longe&s;t &s;tanders here by many years: for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are but newly removed hither from <HI>Hean,</HI> where they re&s;ided altogether before.</P>
<P>There is nothing more in or about the City worth noting, but only a piece of Work on the &s;ame &s;ide, up the River. This is a ma&s;&s;y Frame of Timber, ingeniou&s;ly put together, and very ar|tificially placed on great Piles, that are &s;et upright in the River, ju&s;t by its Banks. The Piles are dri|ven firmly into the Ground, clo&s;e one by another: and all the &s;pace between them and the Bank is filled up with Stones, and on them great Trees laid a-cro&s;s, and pinn'd fa&s;t at each end to the Piles: &s;o that the whole Fabrick mu&s;t be moved before any part of it will yield. This piece of work is rai&s;ed about 16 or 17 foot above the Water in the dry time: but in the wet Sea&s;on the Floods come within 2 or 3 foot of the top. It was made to re&s;i&s;t the violence of the Water in the rainy &s;ea|&s;on: for the Stream then pre&s;&s;eth &s;o hard again&s;t this place, that before this Pile was built, it broke down the Bank, and threatned to carry all before it, even to the ruining of the City, if this cour&s;e had not timely been taken to prevent it. And &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e there is a large Pond ju&s;t within Land, and low Ground between it and the City: So that had it made but a &s;mall breach into the Pond, it would have come even to the Skirts of the City. And tho' the City &s;tands &s;o high as that the Land-floods never reach it, yet the Land on which it &s;tands being a &s;ort of yielding Sand, could not be thought capable of always re&s;i&s;ting &s;uch violence. For the natural Floods do very of|ten make great changes in the River, breaking down
<PB N="50" REF="58">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> one point of Land, and making another point in the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the River; and that chiefly in this part of the Country, where it is bounded with high Banks: for nearer the Sea, where it pre&s;ently overflows, the Floods do &s;eldom make any con&s;i|derable change, and move more quietly.</P>
<P>But to return to the People. They are cour|teous and civil to Strangers, e&s;pecially the trading People: But the great Men are Proud, Haughty and Ambitious; and the Soldiers very in&s;olent. The poorer &s;ort are very Thievi&s;h; in&s;omuch that the Factors and Strangers that traffick hither are forced to keep good Watch in the Night to &s;ecure their Goods, notwith&s;tanding the &s;evere Puni&s;hments they have again&s;t Thieves. They have indeed great Opportunities of Thieving, the Hou&s;es being &s;o &s;lightly built: But they will work a way under Ground, rather than fail; and u&s;e many &s;ub|tle Stratagems. I am a Stranger to any Cere|monies u&s;ed by them in Marriage, or at the Birth of a Child, or the like, if they u&s;e any: Polygamy is allowed of in this Country, and they buy their Wives of the Parents. The King and great Men keep &s;everal, as their Incli|nations lead them, and their Ability &s;erves. The Poor are &s;tinted for want of means more than de&s;ire: For tho' many are not able to buy, much le&s;s to maintain one Wife; yet mo&s;t of them make a &s;hift to get one, for here are &s;ome very low prized ones, that are glad to take up with poor Hu&s;bands. But then in hard times, the Man mu&s;t &s;ell both Wife and Children, to buy Rice to main|tain him&s;elf. Yet this is not &s;o common here as in &s;ome Places; as I before ob&s;erved of the <HI>Mala|bar</HI> and <HI>Coromandel</HI> Coa&s;ts. This cu&s;tom among them of buying Wives, ea&s;ily degenerates into that other of hiring Mi&s;&s;es, and gives great liberty to the young Women, who offer them&s;elves of then
<PB N="51" REF="59">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> own accord to any Ssrangers, who will go to their price. There are of them of all prizes, from 100 Dollars to 5 Dollars, and the refu&s;e of all will be care&s;&s;ed by the poor Seamen. Such as the <HI>La&s;cars,</HI> who are <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> coming hither in Ve&s;&s;els from <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> and other places; who yet have nothing to give them, but &s;uch Fragments of Food, as their Commons will afford. Even the great Men of <HI>Tonquin</HI> will offer their Daughters to the Merchants and Officers, tho' their &s;tay is not likely to be above 5 or 6 Months in the Country: neither are they affraid to be with Child by <HI>White</HI> Men, for thir Children will be much fairer than their Mothers, and con&s;equently of greater repute, when they grow up, if they be Girls. Nor is it any great charge to breed them here: and at the wor&s;t, if their Mothers are not able to maintain them, 'tis but &s;elling them when they are young. But to return, the Women who thus let them&s;elves to hire, if they have been &s;o frugal as to &s;ave what they have got by the&s;e loo&s;e Amours, they &s;oon procure Hu&s;bands, that will love and e&s;teem them well enough: and them&s;elves al&s;o will prove afterwards obedient and faithful Wives. For 'tis &s;aid, that even while they are with Strangers, they are very faithful to them; e&s;pecially to &s;uch as remain long in the Country, or make annual returns hither, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> generally do. Many of the&s;e have gotten good E&s;tates by their <HI>Tonquin</HI> Ladies; and that chiefly by tru&s;ting them with Money and Goods. For in this poor Country 'tis a great advantage to watch the Market; and the&s;e female Merchants having &s;tocks will mightily im|prove them, taking their opportunities of buying raw Silk in the dead time of the Year. With this they will employ the poor People, when work is &s;carce; and get it cheaper and better done, than when Ships are here: for then every man being em|ployed

<P>When a Man dies he is interr'd in his own Land, for here are no common Burying-places: And within a Month afterwards the Friends of the de|cea&s;ed, e&s;pecially if he was the Ma&s;ter of the Fami|ly, mu&s;t make a great Fea&s;t of Fle&s;h and Fruit at the Grave. 'Tis a thing belonging to the Prie&s;ts Office to a&s;&s;i&s;t at this &s;olemnity; they are always there, and take care to &s;ee that the Friends of the decea&s;ed have it duly performed. To make this Fea&s;t they are obliged to &s;ell a piece of Land, tho' they have Money enough otherways: Which Money they be&s;tow in &s;uch things as are nece&s;&s;ary for the Solemnity, which is more or le&s;s, according to the quality of the decea&s;ed. If he was a great Man, there is a Tower of Wood erected over the Grave; it may be 7 or 8 Foot &s;quare, and built 20 or 25 foot high. About 20 yards from the Tow|er, are little Sheds built with Stalls, to lay the Provi|&s;ions on, both of Meat and Fruits of all &s;orts, and that in great plenty. Thither the Country People re&s;ort to fill their Bellies, for the Fea&s;t &s;eems to be free for all Comers, at lea&s;t of the Neighbourhood. How it is dre&s;t or di&s;tributed about, I know not; but there the People wait till 'tis ready. Then the Prie&s;t gets within the Tower, and climbs up to the top, and looking out from thence, makes an Oration to the People below. After this the Prie&s;t de&s;cends, and then they &s;et Fire to the Foundation of the Tower, burn it down to the Ground: and when this is done they fall to their Meat.

The Frames are contrived like ours in the Fields about <HI>London</HI> in Holiday times: but they who &s;wing &s;tand upright in the lower part of the Swing, which is only a &s;tick &s;tanding on each end, being fa&s;tned to a pendulous Rope, which they hold fa&s;t with their hands on each &s;ide; and they rai&s;e them&s;elves to &s;uch a prodigious heighth, that if the Swing &s;hould break they mu&s;t needs break their Limbs at be&s;t, if not kill them&s;elves outright. Others &s;pend their time in drinking. Their ordi|nary Drink is Tea: but they make them&s;elves mer|ry with hot Rack, which &s;ometimes al&s;o they mix with their Tea. Either way it hath an odd na&s;ty ta&s;te, but is very &s;trong: and is therefore much e&s;teemed by them: e&s;pecially at this time, when they &s;o much devote them&s;elves to Mirth, or Mad|ne&s;s, or even be&s;tial Drunkenne&s;s. The richer &s;ort are more re&s;erved: yet they will al&s;o be very merry at this time. The Nobles treat their friends with good Cheer and the be&s;t Rack; but indeed there is none good in this Country. Yet &s;uch as they have they e&s;teem as a great Cordial; e&s;pecially when Snakes and Scorpions have been infu&s;ed therein, as I have been informed. This is not only accounted a great Cordial, but an Antitode again&s;t the Lepro&s;ie, and
<PB N="54" REF="62">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> all &s;orts of Poy&s;on; and 'tis accounted a great piece of re&s;pect to any one to treat him with his Liquor.

<P>The Betle Leaf is the great entertainment in the Ea&s;t for all Vi&s;itants; and 'tis always given with the Arek &s;olded up in it. They make up the Arek in pellets &s;it for u&s;e, by fir&s;t peeling off the outer green hard rind of the Nuts, and then &s;plitting it length-ways in 3 or 4 parts, more or le&s;s, accord|ing to its bigne&s;s. Then they dawb the Leaf all o|ver with <HI>Chinam</HI> or Lime made into a Mortar or Pa&s;te, and kept in a Box for this purpo&s;e, &s;pread|ing it thin.</P>
<P>And here by the way I &s;hall take notice of a &s;lip in the former Volume, p. 318. which I de&s;ire may be corrected: the Nut being there by mi&s;take call'd the Betle, and the Arek-tree call'd the Betle-tree, whereas <HI>Betle</HI> is the name of the Leaf they chew. In this Leaf thus &s;pread with <HI>Chinam,</HI> they roll up a &s;lice of <HI>Arek Nut,</HI> very neatly, and make a pellet of about an Inch long, and as big as the top of ones finger. Every man here has a Box that will hold a great many of the&s;e pellets, in which they keep a &s;tore ready made up: for all per&s;ons, of what quality &s;oever, from the Prince to the Beggar, chew abundance of it. The poorer &s;ort carry a &s;mall pouchful about with them: But the <HI>Mandarius,</HI> or great men, have curious oval Boxes, made purpo&s;ely for this u&s;e, that will hold 50 or 60 Betle Pellets. The&s;e Boxes are neatly lackered and gilded, both in&s;ide or out&s;ide, with a cover to take off; and if any &s;tranger vi&s;its them, e&s;pe|cially <HI>Europeans,</HI> they are &s;ure, among other good entertainment, to be treated with a Box of Betle.

<P>It is accounted good breeding to commend the ta&s;te or neatne&s;s of this pre&s;ent; and they all love to be flatter'd. You thereby extreamly plea&s;e the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, and ingage him to be your friend: and afterwards you may be &s;ure he will not fail to &s;end his Servant with a pre&s;ent of Betle once in two or three mornings, with a comple|ment to know how you do. This will co&s;t you a &s;mall gratuity to the Servant, who joyfully acquaints his Ma&s;ter how gratefully you received the Pre&s;ent: and this &s;till engages him more; and he will com|plement you with great re&s;pect whenever he meets you. I was invited to one of the&s;e New-years Fea&s;ts by one of the Country, and accordingly went a&s;hore, as many other Seamen did upon like invitations. I know not what entertainment they had; but mine was like to be but mean, and there|fore I pre&s;ently left it. The &s;taple Di&s;h was Rice, which I have &s;aid before is the common food: Be&s;ides which, my friend, that he might the better entertain me and his others Gue&s;ts, had been in the morning a fi&s;hing in a Pond not far from his hou&s;e, and had caught a huge me&s;s of Frogs, and with great joy brought them home as &s;oon as I came to his hou&s;e. I wonder'd to &s;ee him turn out &s;o ma|ny of the&s;e creatures into a Ba&s;ket; and a&s;king him what they were for? he told me, to eat: but how he dre&s;t them I know not; I did not like his Dainties &s;o well as to &s;tay and dine with him.</P>
<P>The other great Fea&s;t they have, is after their <HI>May</HI>-crop is hous'd, about the beginning of <HI>June.</HI> At this Fea&s;t al&s;o they have publick Rejoycing; but much inferiour to tho&s;e of their New-years Fea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="64">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> Their Religion is Pagani&s;m, and they are great Idolaters: Neverthele&s;s they own an omnipotent, &s;upream, over-ruling power, that beholds both them and their actions, and &s;o &s;ar takes notice of them, as to reward the good, and puni&s;h the bad in the other world. For they believe the immor|tality of the Soul: but the notion that they have of the Deity is very ob&s;cure. Yet by the Figures which they make repre&s;enting this God, they manife&s;tly &s;hew that they do believe him to excel in &s;ight, &s;trength, courage and wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, &amp;c. For tho' their Idols, which are made in human &s;hapes, are very different in their forms; yet they all repre&s;ent &s;omewhat extraordinary, either in the countenance, or in the make of the body or limbs. Some are very corpulent and fat, others are very lean, &s;ome al&s;o have many eyes, others as many hands, and all gra&s;ping &s;omewhat. Their a&s;pects are al&s;o different, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure repre&s;enting what they are made to imitate, or there is &s;ome|what in their hands or lying by them, to illu&s;trate the meaning of the Figure. Several pa&s;&s;ions are al&s;o repre&s;ented in the countenance of the Image, as love, hatred, joy, grief. I was told of one Image that was placed &s;itting on his Hams, with his Elbows re&s;ting on his knees, and his Chin re&s;t|ing on his 2 Thumbs, for the &s;upporting his Head, which lookt drooping forwards: his Eyes were mournfully lifted up towards Heaven, and the figure was &s;o lean, and the countenance and whole com|po&s;ure was &s;o &s;orrowful, that it was enough to move the beholder with pity and compa&s;&s;ion. My Friend &s;aid he was much affected with the &s;ight thereof.</P>
<P>There are other Images al&s;o, that are in the &s;hape of Bea&s;ts, either Elephants or Hor&s;es, for I have not &s;een them in any other &s;hape. The <HI>Pago|das</HI> or Idol Temples, are not &s;umptuous and mag|nificent, as in &s;ome of the Neighbouring Kingdoms.
<PB N="57" REF="65">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> They are generally built with Timber, and are but &s;mall and low: yet mo&s;tly covered with Pan|tile; e&s;pecially the City <HI>Pagodas:</HI> but in the Coun|try &s;ome of them are thatched.

<P>The Hor&s;e and Elephant Images I &s;aw, were both &s;orts about the bigne&s;s and height of a good Hor&s;e, each &s;tanding in the mid&s;t of a little Tem|ple, ju&s;t big enough to contain them, with their heads towards the door: and &s;ometimes one, &s;ome|times two together in a Temple, which was always open. There were up and down in the Country other buildings, &s;uch as <HI>Pagodas,</HI> or Temples, Tombs, or the like, le&s;s than the&s;e; and not above the heighth of a man: but the&s;e were always &s;hut &s;o clo&s;e, that I could not &s;ee what was within them.</P>
<P>There were many <HI>Pagan</HI> Prie&s;ts belonging to the&s;e <HI>Pagodas,</HI> and 'tis reported that they are by the Laws tied to &s;trict rules of Living, as ab&s;tinence from Women, and &s;trong drink e&s;pecially, and en|joined a poor &s;ort of Life. Yet they don't &s;eem to confine them&s;elves much to the&s;e Rules: but their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence being chiefly from Offerings, and there being many of them, they are u&s;ually very poor. The Offerings to the Prie&s;t is commonly 2 or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> handfuls of Rice, a box of Betle, or &s;ome &s;uch like pre&s;ent. One thing the people re&s;ort to them for is Fortune-telling, at which they pretend to be very expert, and will be much offended if any di&s;pute their &s;kill in that, or the truth of their Re|ligion. Their Habitations are very little and mean, clo&s;e by the <HI>Pagodas,</HI> where they con&s;tantly attend to offer the petitions of the poor people, that fre|quently re&s;ort thither on &s;ome &s;uch errand. For they have no &s;et times of Devotion, neither do they &s;eem to e&s;teem one day above another, except
<PB N="58" REF="66">

<P>I think the <HI>Mandarins</HI> and rich people &s;eldom come to the <HI>Pagodas,</HI> but have a Clerk of their own, who reads the Petition in their own Courts or Yards: and it &s;hould &s;eem by this, that the <HI>Manda|rins</HI> have a better &s;en&s;e of the Deity, than the com|mon People; for in the&s;e Yards, there is no Idol, before whom to perform the Ceremony, but 'tis done with Eyes lift up to Heaven. When they make this Petition they order a great deal of good meat to be dre&s;t, and calling all their Servants into the Court, where the Ceremony is to be per&s;ormed, they place the food on a Table, where al&s;o 2 Incen&s;e-pots are placed, and then the <HI>Mandarin</HI> pre&s;ents a paper to the Clerk, who reads it with an audible voice. In the fir&s;t place there is drawn up an ample account of all that God has ble&s;t him withal, as Health, Riches, Honour, Favour of his Prince, &amp;c. and long Life, if he be old; and towards the conclu&s;ion, there is a Petition to God for a continuance of all the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, and a farther augmentation of them; e&s;pecially with long life and favour of his Prince, which la&s;t they e&s;teem as the greate&s;t of all Ble&s;|&s;ings. While this paper is reading the Ma&s;ter kneels down, and bows his face down to the Earth: and when the Clerk has done reading it, he puts it to the burning ru&s;hes, that are in the Incen&s;e-pot, where 'tis con&s;um'd.

<P>The <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> Language is &s;poken very much through the throat, but many words of it are pro|nounced through the teeth. It has a great affinity to the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Language, e&s;pecially the <HI>Fokein</HI> dia|lect, as I have been informed: and tho' their words are differently pronounced, yet they can under&s;tand each others writings, the characters and words being &s;o near the &s;ame. The Court Lan|guage e&s;pecially is very near the <HI>Chine&s;e;</HI> for the Courtiers being all Scholars, they &s;peak more ele|gantly; and it differs very much from the vulgar corrupted Language. But for the <HI>Malayan</HI> Tongue, which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tavernier</HI>'s Brother in his Hi&s;to|ry of <HI>Tonquin</HI> &s;ays is the Court Language, I ne|ver could hear by any per&s;on that it is &s;poken there, tho I have made particular inquiry about it; neither can I be of his opinion in that matter. For the <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> have no manner of Trade with any <HI>Malayans</HI> that I could ob&s;erve or learn, neither have any of their neighbours: and for what other grounds the <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> &s;hould receive that language I know not. It is not probable that either Con|que&s;t, Trade or Religion could bring it in; nor do they travel towards <HI>Malacca,</HI> but towards <HI>China;</HI> and commonly 'tis from one of the&s;e cau&s;es that Men learn the language of another Nation. The remarkable &s;moothne&s;s of that Language, I confe&s;s, might excite &s;ome people to learn it out of curio&s;ity: but the <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> are not &s;o curious.</P>
<P>They have Schools of Learning and Nur&s;eries to tutor youth. The Characters they write in are the &s;ame with the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> by what I could judge; and they write with a hair Pencil, not &s;itting at a Table, as we do, but &s;tand upright. They hold their Paper in one hand, and write with the other:
<PB N="60" REF="68">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> making their Characters very exact and fair. They write their lines right down from the top to the bottom, beginning the fir&s;t line from the right hand, and &s;o proceeding on towards the left.

<P>The <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> have learnt &s;everal Mechanick Arts and Trades, &s;o that here are many Trade&s;men, <HI>viz.</HI> Smiths, Carpenters, Sawyers, Joyners, Tur|ners, Weavers, Tailors, Potters, Painters, Money|changers, Paper-makers, Workers on Lacker were Bell-founders, &amp;c.

The Labourers at this Trade can work only in the dry Sea&s;on, or when the drying North Winds blow: for as they lay &s;everal Coats of Lack, one on another, &s;o the&s;e mu&s;t all have time to be throughly dry, before an outer Coat can be laid on the former. It grows blacki&s;h of it &s;elf, when expo&s;ed to the Air; but the Colour is heightned by Oil and other ingredients mixt with it. When the out&s;ide Coat is dry, they poli&s;h it to bring it to a glo&s;s. This is done chiefly by often rubbing it with the ball or palm of their Hands. They can make the Lack of any colour, and tem|per it &s;o as to make therewith good Glew, &s;aid to be the be&s;t in the World: It is al&s;o very cheap, and prohibited Exportation.

<P>THis Kingdom is an ab&s;olute Monarchy, but of &s;uch a kind as is not in the World again; for if has two Kings, and each &s;upreme in his particular way: The one is called <HI>Boua,</HI> the other <HI>Choua;</HI> which la&s;t Name I have been told &s;ignifies <HI>Ma&s;ier.</HI> The <HI>Boua</HI> and his Ance&s;tors were the &s;ole Mo|narchs of <HI>Tonquin;</HI> tho' I know not whether as in|dependant Soveraigns, or as Tributaries to <HI>China,</HI> of which they have been thought to have been a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tier Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ince, if not a Colony: for there is a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> between them in their Language.
<PB N="67" REF="75">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> Religion, and Cu&s;toms. The&s;e 2 Kings they have at pre&s;ent, are not any way related in their De&s;cent or Families: nor could I learn how long their Government has continued in the pre|&s;ent form; but it appears to have been for &s;ome Succe&s;&s;ions. The occa&s;ion is variou&s;ly reported; but &s;ome give this account of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Boua</HI>'s, or antient Kings of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> were formerly Ma&s;ters of <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> and kept that Nation in &s;ubjection by an Army of <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> con|&s;tantly kept there, under a General or Deputy, who rul'd them. When <HI>Cochinchina</HI> threw off the <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> Yoak, the King had two great Generals, one in <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> and another in <HI>Tonquin</HI> it &s;elf. The&s;e two Generals differing, he who was in <HI>Cochinchina</HI> revolted from his Soveraign of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> and by his Power over the Army there, made him&s;elf King of <HI>Cochinchina:</HI> &s;ince which the&s;e two Nations have always been at Wars; yet each Nation of late is rather on the defen&s;ive part than on the offen&s;ive. But when the General who commanded in <HI>Cochinchina</HI> had been thus &s;uc|ce&s;sful in his Revolt from under the <HI>Boua,</HI> the <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> General took the Courage to do &s;o too; and having gained the Affections of his Army, de|prived the King, his Ma&s;ter, of all the Regal Power, and kept it with all the Revenues of the Crown in his own Hands: yet leaving the other the Title of King; probably, becau&s;e of the great zeal the People had for that Family. And thus the Kingdom came wholly into the Power of this <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> General, and his Heirs, who carry the Title of <HI>Choua;</HI> the <HI>Boua's</HI> of the Ancient Fami|ly having only the &s;hadow of that Authority they were formerly Ma&s;ters of. The <HI>Boua</HI> lives the Life of a kind of a Pri&s;oner of State, within the old Palace, with his Women and Children; and diverts him&s;elf in Boats among his Fi&s;h-ponds
<PB N="68" REF="76">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> within the Palace Walls, but never &s;tirs without tho&s;e bounds. He is held in great Veneration by all the <HI>Tonquine&s;e,</HI> and &s;eemingly by the <HI>Choua</HI> al&s;o; who never offers any violence to him, but treats him with all imaginable re&s;pect. The People &s;ay they have no King but <HI>Boua;</HI> and &s;eem to have &s;ad apprehen&s;ions of the lo&s;s they &s;hould have, if he &s;hould dye without an Heir: and whenever the <HI>Choua</HI> comes into his prefence, which is 2 or 3 times in the year, he u&s;eth abundance of Com|pliments to him, and tells him, that his very Life is at his &s;ervice, and that he governs and rules wholly to do him a kindne&s;s: and always gives him the upper hand. So al&s;o when any Amba&s;&s;adors are &s;ent from the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> they will de|liver their Me&s;&s;age to none but the <HI>Boua,</HI> and have their Audience of him. Yet after all this Pageantry, the <HI>Boua</HI> has only a few Servants to attend him, none of the <HI>Mandarins</HI> make their Court to him, nor is he allow'd any Guards: All the Magi&s;tracy and Soldiery, Trea&s;ure, and the ordering of all Matters of Peace or War, are en|tirely at the <HI>Choua</HI>'s di&s;po&s;al; all preferment is from him, and the very Servants who attend the <HI>Boua,</HI> are &s;uch only as the <HI>Choua</HI> places about him. Be&s;ides the&s;e Servants, none are ever &s;uffer'd to &s;ee the <HI>Boua,</HI> much le&s;s Strangers: So that I could learn nothing as to his Per&s;on. But as to the <HI>Choua,</HI> I have been informed that he is an angry, ill-natured, leprous Per&s;on. He lives in the &s;econd Palace, where he has ten or twelve Wives; but what Children I know not. He governs with ab|&s;olute Authority over the Subjects, and with great tyranny: for their Lives, Goods, and E&s;tates are at his Command. The Province of <HI>Tenehoa</HI> is &s;aid to have belonged properly to his Ance&s;tors, who were grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Mandarins</HI> before the u&s;urpation So that he now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s to have a particular value

This Trea&s;ure is buried in great Ci&s;terns full of Water, made purpo&s;ely for that u&s;e: and to &s;ecure it, he keeps a great many Soldiers there; and commits the charge, both of them and the Trea&s;ure, to the Governour of the Province, who is one of his principal Eunuchs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Choua</HI> has always a &s;trong guard of Soldiers about his Palace, and many large Stables for his Hor&s;es and Elephants. The Hor&s;es are about 13 or 14 hands high, and are kept very fat: there are 2 or 300 of them. The Elephants are kept in long Stables by them&s;elves, each having a pecu|liar room or partition, with a Keeper to dre&s;s and feed him. The number of the King's Elephants are about 150 or 200. They are watered and wa&s;hed every day in the River.</P>
<P>Some of the Elephants are very gentle and go|vernable, others are more indocil and unruly. When the&s;e rude ones are to pa&s;s through the Streets, tho' only to be watered, the Rider or Dre&s;&s;er orders a Gong or Drum to be beaten before him, to warn People that an unruly Elephant is coming; and they pre&s;ently clear the Streets and give a pa&s;&s;age for the Bea&s;t; who will do mi&s;|chief to any that are in the way, and their Riders or Keepers cannot re&s;train him.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Choua</HI>'s Palace, there is a large parade, or &s;quare place for the Soldiers to be drawn up. On one &s;ide there is a place for the <HI>Mandarins</HI> to &s;it, and &s;ee the Soldiers exerci&s;e, on the other &s;ide there is a &s;hed, wherein all the Cannon and heavy Guns are lodged. There may be 50 or 60 Iron Guns from Falcon to Demy-Culverin, 2 or 3 whole Culverin or Demi-Cannon, and &s;ome old Iron Mortars lying on logs. The Guns are mount|ed on their Carriages, but the Carriages of the&s;e Guns are old and very ill made. There is one
<PB N="70" REF="78">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> great Bra&s;s Gun, much bigger than the re&s;t, &s;up|po&s;ed to be 8 or 9000 pound weight. It is of a taper bore; of a foot diameter at the mouth, but much &s;maller at the britch. It is an ill &s;haped thing, yet much e&s;teemed by them, probably be|cau&s;e it was ca&s;t here, and the bigge&s;t that ever they made. It was ca&s;t about 12 or 13 years ago, and it being &s;o heavy, they cou'd not contrive to mount it, but were beholding to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to put it into the Carriage; where it now &s;tands more for a &s;how them &s;ervice. But tho this is but an ordinary piece of workman&s;hip, yet the <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> under&s;tand how to run Metals, and are very expert in temper|ing the Earth, wherewith they make their mould.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the great Guns, that I &s;aw or heard of in this Kingdom, neither are here any Forts, yet the King keeps always a great many Solders. 'Tis &s;aid that he has always 70 or 80000 con&s;tant|ly in pay. The&s;e are mo&s;t Foot, they are arm'd with <HI>Curtans</HI> or Sword, and Hand-Guns of 3 foot and an half or 4 foot in the Barrel. The bore is about the bigne&s;s of our Hor&s;e Pi&s;tols, they are all Match|locks, and they are very thick and heavy. The Soldiers do all make their own Powder. They have little Engins for mixing the ingredients, and make as &s;mall a quantity as they plea&s;e. They know not how to corn it, and therefore it is in unequal lumps, &s;ome as big as the top of a mans Thumb, and &s;ome no bigger than a white Pea: neither have I &s;een any Powder well corn'd, that has been made in any of the&s;e Ea&s;tern Nations.</P>
<P>The Soldiers have each a Cartage Box covered with leather, after the manner of the <HI>We&s;t-Indian</HI> Privateers: but in&s;tead of Paper Cartages, the&s;e are filled with &s;mall hollow Canes, each containing a load or charge of Powder; which they empty out of the Cane into the Gun; &s;o that each Box has in it, as it were, &s;o many Bandeleers. Their Arms are kept
<PB N="71" REF="79">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> very bright and clean: for which purpo&s;e every one of them has a hollow Bambo to lay over the Barrel of his Gun; and to keep the du&s;t from it as it lies over the wrack in his Hou&s;e. When they march al&s;o in rainy weather, they have another Bambo, to cover their Guns. This is large enough to cover the whole Barrel, and very well lacker'd; &s;o that it is not only hand&s;ome, but al&s;o pre&s;erves the Gun dry.</P>
<P>The Soldiers when they march are led by an Officer, who is leader of the File: and every File con&s;i&s;ts of 10 men: but as I have been informed by one who has &s;een them march, they don't keep their ranks in marching. The Soldiers are mo&s;t of them lu&s;ty &s;trong well made men: for 'tis that chiefly recommends them to the Kings &s;ervice. They mu&s;t al&s;o have good Stomachs, for that is a greater recommendation than the former; neither can any ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> be entertain'd as a Soldier, that has not a greater &s;troke than ordinary at eating: for by this they judge of his &s;trength and con&s;titution. For which rea&s;on, when a Soldier comes to be li&s;ted, his Stomach is fir&s;t proved with Rice, the common &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the ordinary People in this Kingdom: and according as he acquits him&s;elf in this fir&s;t tryal of his manhood, &s;o he is either di&s;charged or entertain'd in the &s;ervice. 'Tis re|ported, that at the&s;e Tryals they commonly eat 8 or 9 cups of Rice, each containing a pint, and they are ever afterwards e&s;teem'd and advanced, according to the fir&s;t days &s;ervice: and the greate&s;t eaters are chiefly imploy'd as guards to the King, and commonly attend on his per&s;on. The Pro|vince of <HI>Ngean</HI> breeds the lu&s;tie&s;t men, and the be&s;t eaters: for that rea&s;on tho&s;e of that Province are generally imploy'd as Soldiers. After 30 years &s;ervice a Soldier may petition to be disbanded; and then the Village where he was born mu&s;t &s;end another Man to &s;erve in his room.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="80">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> The Hor&s;emen are but few, and armed with Bows, and long Spears or Lances, like the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Turks.</HI> Both the&s;e and the Foot Soldiers are very dexterous in u&s;ing their weapons, and &s;hoot very well either with Gun or Bow; for they are often exerci&s;ed by &s;hooting at Marks. The King orders a &s;hooting match once a year, and rewards the be&s;t marks-man with a fine Coat, or about 1000 <HI>Ca&s;h,</HI> as 'tis called, which is a &s;umm above the value of a Dollar. The mark is a white earthen Cup, placed again&s;t a Bank. The di&s;tance they &s;tand to fire at it is about 80 yards. He who breaks the fir&s;t Cup has the fine&s;t Coat; for there are others al&s;o of le&s;s worth and finery for the re&s;t, that have the good fortune to break the other Cups, or <HI>Ca&s;h</HI> in lieu of them. This is all at the Kings charge, who incourages this exerci&s;e very much, as a means to make them good Marks-men; and they generally prove &s;uch. They will load and fire the quicke&s;t of any People. They draw the Rammer at one motion, and powring down the Powder and Bullet, they ram all down at one motion more. Then they withdraw the Rammer, and put it into its place, at 2 motions more. All the 4 motions are performed very dexterou&s;ly and quick: and when they &s;hoot at a mark, they level, and fire at fir&s;t &s;ight, yet very &s;ucce&s;s|fully.</P>
<P>Tho' the King of <HI>Tonquin</HI> has no Forts, yet he keeps always a great many Soldiers in the Fron|tier Towns of his Kingdom; e&s;pecially on the S. W. part thereof, to check the <HI>Cochinchine&s;e,</HI> his implacable Enemies: and tho' there &s;eldom hap|pens a pitch'd Battel between them, yet there are often Skirmi&s;hings, which keep the Soldiers on each &s;ide upon thier guards: and &s;ometimes there are con&s;iderable excur&s;ions made by one or other party into the Enemies Territories, where they
<PB N="73" REF="81">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> kill, &s;poil, and bring away what Booty they can find. The King al&s;o has always about 30000 near his per&s;on, and quarter'd in or about <HI>Cachao,</HI> ready on all occa&s;ions. The dry &s;ea&s;on is the time for his Armies to take the Field, or go again&s;t an Ene|my: for in the&s;e Countries there is no marching in the Wet &s;ea&s;on. When he &s;ends an Army by Land on any expedition, the General, and other great Officers are mounted on Elephants. The&s;e have neat little boarded Hou&s;es or Ca&s;tles fa&s;tned on their backs, where the great men &s;it in &s;tate, &s;ecur'd from the Sun or Rain. They have no Field-pieces in their Armies, but in&s;tead thereof they carry on mens backs Guns that will carry a four ounce Shot. The barrels of the&s;e Guns are about 6 or 7 foot long: but tho' one man carries one of them on his back, yet he cannot hold it out to fire, like &s;mall Guns, but re&s;ts it on its Carriage, which is another Man's burden, and they two manage it between them. The Carri|age is only a round piece of Wood, about 4 inches thick, and 6 or 7 foot long. One end of the Carriage is &s;upported with two Legs, or a Fork of three foot high, the other re&s;ts on the ground. The Gun is placed on the top, where there is an Iron Socket for the Gun to re&s;t in, and a Swivel to turn the Muzzel any way. From the britch of the Gun there is a &s;hort &s;tock, for the man who fires the Gun to traver&s;e it withal, and to re&s;t it again&s;t his &s;houlder. The u&s;e of the&s;e Guns is to clear a Pa&s;s, or to fire over the Rivers, when the Enemy is &s;o commodiou&s;ly plac'd, that there is no other way to move him; and they are carry'd by the&s;e two men almo&s;t with as much ea&s;e as Mus|kets. In the&s;e Land-expeditions they carry but little Baggage, be&s;ides their nece&s;&s;ary Arms, Am|munition, and Provender: &s;o that if they are routed they lightly &s;camper away; and generally

<P>Be&s;ides the Soldiers on the Frontiers, and tho&s;e who attend the King about <HI>Cachao,</HI> he has many others that keep guards in &s;everal parts of his King|dom, e&s;pecially in the great Roads, and on the Rivers.

They al&s;o look after the Cu&s;tome, and &s;ee that all goods have paid, before they may pa&s;s further. All Travellers are al&s;o &s;earch'd by them, and &s;trictly examined; and if any per&s;ons are taken only on &s;u&s;picion, they are u&s;ed very &s;everely, till they can clear them&s;elves: &s;o that no di&s;affected or rebellious per&s;on can &s;tir, with|out being pre&s;ently known; and this renders the King very &s;afe in his Government.</P>
<P>The Kings Naval-force con&s;i&s;ts only in a &s;ort of flat bottom Gallies, and the&s;e &s;eemingly de&s;igned more for State than &s;ervice, except to tran&s;port Soldiers from one place to another. The&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are 50, 60, or 70 foot long, and about 10 or 12 foot broad in the wa&s;te; and the 2 ends near as many foot high out of the water, e&s;pecially the hinderpart or Stern: but the wa&s;te or middle of the Ve&s;&s;el is not above 2 foot and an half from the wa|ter, that being the place, by which all the men go in and out. from thence towards each end, it is gently and very artificially rai&s;ed, to a con&s;iderable heighth, &s;o that the whole fabrick appears very graceful and plea&s;ant, as it moves on the water. The head or forepart is not altogether &s;o high as the Stern, neither is there &s;o much co&s;t be&s;towed on it for ornament: for tho' it wants neither carv'd work or painting, yet 'tis not comparable to that of the Stern, which has great variety of carving and is curiou&s;ly lacker'd and gilded. The place

This is more magnificent than the re&s;t, tho' all are built much of one form. From the Stern to the wa&s;te, it is covered over with a &s;light covering, to &s;helter the Men and their Arms from the Rain in the wet &s;ea&s;on, and the &s;corching Sun in the dry. Before the wa&s;te there are places for the Oars on each &s;ide, and a plain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ven Deck for the Rowers to &s;tand by their ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">k|ling.

<P>The Soldiers are always the men that row, and they are all naked, except that they have a nar|row piece of black Cloath like a Sa&s;h about their Wa&s;tes, which is brought between their Thighs, and tuckt again under their Wa&s;te.

Then the Rowers all at once an&s;wer with a &s;ort of a hollow noi&s;e, through the Throat, and a &s;tamp on the Deck with one foot, and immediately plunge their Oars into the Water.

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> When the Galleys are not in &s;ervice, they are dragged a&s;hoar, and placed in Hou&s;es built for that purpo&s;e; where they are &s;et upright on their bottoms, made very clean, and kept neat and dry. The&s;e Galley-Hou&s;es are 50 or 60 paces from the River &s;ide; and when they bring the Galleys into them, there is a &s;trong Rope brought round the &s;tern of the Ve&s;&s;el, and both ends &s;tretched along, one on each &s;ide: then 3 or 400 Men, &s;tanding ready with the Rope in their Hands, wait for the &s;ignal; which being given by the beat of a Gong, they begin to draw withal their &s;trength; and making a great &s;hrieking noi&s;e; they run her up in a trice into her place. This al&s;o is their Soldiers work, who having thus Hou&s;ed all their Galleys, return to their Land|&s;ervice.</P>
<P>Some of the Soldiers are employed al&s;o in keep|ing Watch and Ward, for the &s;ecurity of private Men, as well as in the King's bu&s;ine&s;s: and the <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> are ob&s;erv'd to keep good orders in the Night in all Towns and Villages; but more parti|cularly in the great Cities, and e&s;pecially at <HI>Ca|chao.</HI> There every Street is guarded with a &s;trong Watch, as well to keep &s;ilence, as to hinder any di&s;order. The Watch-men are armed with Staves, and &s;tand in the Street by the Watch-hou&s;es, to examin every one that pa&s;&s;eth by. There is al&s;o a Rope &s;tretched cro&s;s the Street brea&s;t high, and no Man may pa&s;s this place, till he is examin'd, unle&s;s he will venture to be &s;oundly bang'd by the Watch. The&s;e Men can handle their Weapon &s;o well, that if they de&s;ign mi&s;chief, they will dex|trou&s;ly break a Leg or Thigh-bone, that being the place which they commonly &s;trike at. There is a pair of Stocks by every Watch-hou&s;e, to &s;ecure Night Ramblers in: but for a &s;mall piece of Money a Man may pa&s;s quiet enough, and for the

The&s;e Watch-men are Soldiers, but belong to the Governor or &s;ome other Men of great Power, who will hear no Complaints again&s;t them, tho' never &s;o ju&s;tly made: and therefore they often put Men in the Stocks at their plea&s;ure, and in the Morning carry them before a Magi&s;trate: who commonly fines the Pri&s;oners to pay &s;omewhat; and be it more or le&s;s, it falls part to the Magi&s;trate. Neither dares any Man complain of inju&s;tice upon &s;uch u&s;age, in this ca&s;e e&s;pecially; tho' his cau&s;e be never &s;o ju&s;t: and therefore patience is in this Country as ne|ce&s;&s;ary for poor People, as in any part of the World.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Abu&s;es, they have one Cu&s;tom in the Admini&s;tring Ju&s;tice, that is plea&s;ing enough. For if a difference or quarrel at any time happens between 2 mean Men, and they are not to be reconciled without going before a Ma|gi&s;trate, he u&s;ually con&s;idering their Poverty, lays no heavy mulct on the Offender, but injoins him this as his penalty, that he &s;hall treat the injur'd Per&s;on with a Jarr of Arack, and a Fowl, or a &s;mall Por|ker, that &s;o fea&s;ting together, they may both drown all animo&s;ity in good Liquor, and renew their Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>But if it be a Controver&s;y about a Debt, they take a very different Method. For the Debtors are many times order'd to be Pri&s;oners in their Creditors hou&s;es, where they are beaten, or kept with a log of Wood made fa&s;t to their Legs, to hinder them from run|ning away. The&s;e poor Pri&s;oners eat nothing but Rice and drink Water, and are tyranically in&s;ulted over by their rigid Creditors, till the Debt is &s;atisfied. Their Corporal Puni&s;hments upon Malefactors, and &s;ome times upon others are very &s;evere. Some an loaden with Iron Chains fa&s;tned to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> with logs al&s;o like the Debtors, but now mentioned Others have their Necks inclo&s;ed between 2 grea
<PB N="79" REF="87">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> heavy Planks made like a Pillory, but moveable, for they carry it about with them where-ever they go, and even when they go to re&s;t they are forced to lye down and &s;leep in it as they can.</P>
<P>There is another &s;ort of puni&s;hing In&s;trument not unlike this, called a <HI>Gongo.</HI> This al&s;o is made to wear about the Neck, but is &s;haped like a Lad|der. The &s;ides of it are 2 large Bamboes, of about 10 or 12 foot long, with &s;everal &s;uch rounds or &s;ticks as Ladders have to keep the &s;ides a&s;under; but much &s;horter: for the 2 &s;ide Bamboes are no farther a&s;under, than to admit of a narrow room for the Neck; and the 2 rounds in the middle are much at the &s;ame di&s;tance from each other, on each &s;ide the Neck, forming a little Square: thro' which the Man looks as if he were carrying a Ladder on his Shoulders, with his Head thro' the rounds. If either of the&s;e Yokes were to be taken off in a &s;hort time, as in 6, 9, or 12 hours, it would be no great matter: but to wear one of them a Month, 2, 3, or longer, as I have been informed they &s;ometimes do, &s;eems to be a very &s;evere puni&s;h|ment. Yet 'tis &s;ome comfort to &s;ome, that they have the Liberty to walk abroad where they will: but others are both yoak'd and impri&s;on'd: and the Pri&s;oners in publick Pri&s;ons are u&s;ed wor&s;e than a Man would u&s;e a Dog, they being half &s;tarved and &s;oundly beaten to boot.</P>
<P>They have a particular puni&s;hment for &s;uch as are &s;u&s;pected to fire Hou&s;es, or who are thought to have occa&s;ioned the Fire through their neglect. The Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, where the Fire fir&s;t breaks out, will hardly clear him&s;elf from &s;u&s;picion, and the &s;everity of the Law. The puni&s;hment in this ca&s;e is to &s;it in a Chair of 12 or 14 foot high, bare-headed, 3 whole days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the hot &s;corching Sun: this Chair is &s;et, for his greater di&s;|grace, before the place where his Hou&s;e &s;tood.</P>

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> Other &s;maller Crimes are puni&s;hed with blows; which we call Bambooing.

The number of his Blows are more or le&s;s; according to the nature of the Crime, or the plea&s;ure of the Magi&s;trate; yet Money will buy favour of the Executioner, who knows how to moderate his &s;trokes for a Fee before-hand. Otherwi&s;e his blows u&s;ually fall &s;o heavy that the poor Offender may be lamed a Month or two. After a Man has &s;uffered any of the&s;e puni&s;hments, he can never obtain any publick favour or employment.</P>
<P>They have no Courts of Judicature, but any &s;ingle Magi&s;trate i&s;&s;ues out his Warrants for the apprehending of Malefactors, and upon taking them immediately tries them: and as the Sentence is final, and without appeal, &s;o 'tis no &s;ooner pa&s;t, but 'tis executed al&s;o without more ado. Their puni&s;hment in capital crimes is u&s;ually beheading. The Criminal is carried immediately from the Magi&s;trates Hou&s;e to his own: for there is no com|mon place of Execution, but the Malefactor &s;uf|fers near his own Hou&s;e, or where the fact was committed.

<P>The Magi&s;trates and other great Men of this Kingdom are called <HI>Mandarins.</HI> Mo&s;t of them in Office about the King are Eunuchs, and not only gelded, but al&s;o their Members cut quite off quite flat to their Bellies. The&s;e, as I have been informed, are all very learned Men after their way, e&s;pecially in the Laws of the Country. They ri&s;e gradually by their merit or favour, from one degree to another, as well they who are employ|ed in Civil as in Military Affairs: And &s;carce place of tru&s;t or profit goes be&s;ide them. No Man is permitted to walk familiarly about the King's Palace without the leave of the Eunuch <HI>Mandarins;</HI> and for this Rea&s;on having &s;uch free acce&s;s to the King them&s;elves, and excluding whom they will, they engro&s;s his favour. This is taken &s;o much to Heart by &s;ome, that through envy and di&s;content, they often pine away, as is commonly &s;aid, even to Death: And I heard of &s;uch an one, who was called <HI>Ungee Thuan Ding: Ungee</HI> &s;eems a Title of Honour among them. He was a Man of great Learning in the Laws, ex|tremely Politick, and mighty high Spirited. This Man &s;ought all the means imaginable to be pre|ferred, but could not for want of being an Eu|nuch. He fretted to &s;ee his Inferiours rai&s;ed: but plainly &s;eeing that there was no ri&s;ing without removing that objection, he one day in a rage took up a &s;harp Knife, and qualify'd him&s;elf ef|fectually.

This Gentleman, it &s;eems, was Lord of a Village or two, where both he and his Tenants were often plagued with the do|mineering Eunuchs, and having born their Malice for &s;ome time, and &s;eeing no end of it, he a|greed with an expert Gelder to ca&s;trate him: For here are many in this Country, who profe&s;s this Art, and are &s;o expert at it, that they will undertake to cut a Man of any Age, for &s;o many thou&s;and Ca&s;h as the Man is Years old.

The other two, who were Governours of <HI>Cachao,</HI> were al&s;o married Men, and had Children, and one of the&s;e married the Kings Daughter. All the <HI>Mandarins</HI> rule with ab&s;olute Power and Authority in their &s;everal Precincts, yet in great Obedience to the King; who is as ab&s;o|lute over them, as they are over the Common People.</P>
<P>The&s;e Eunuch <HI>Mandarins</HI> e&s;pecially live in great State.

They are generally covetous beyond mea&s;ure, and very malicious. Some of them are Governours of Provinces, but all are rai&s;ed to Places of tru&s;tand profit.</P>
<P>Once every Year the <HI>Mandarins</HI> receive an Oath of Allegiance to the King, from all the principal

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> Officers under them. This is done with great Ceremony: they cut the Throat of a Hen, and let the Blood fall into a Ba&s;on of Arack. Of this Arack every Man has a &s;mall draught given him to drink, after he has publickly declared his &s;incerity and readine&s;s to &s;erve his Prince. 'Tis e&s;teemed the &s;olemne&s;t tye by which any Man can ingage him&s;elf. This way of giving &s;olemn potions to drink, is u&s;ed al&s;o in other Countries, on different occa&s;ions. As particularly on the <HI>Gold Coa&s;t</HI> of <HI>Guinea;</HI> where when Men or Women are taxed for a Crime, be it of what Nature it will, but e&s;pecially Adultery, and the matter cannot be proved by Evidence, the <HI>Feti&s;&s;ero</HI> or Prie&s;t, decides the difference, by giving a Potion of bitter Water, to the Per&s;on ac|cu&s;ed: which if they refu&s;e to take, they are &s;up|po&s;ed to be guilty without farther proof: but if they drink it off, the event is &s;aid to be, that if the Per&s;ons be guilty, this Water immediately &s;wells their bodies till they bur&s;t; but if innocent, they are not hurt thereby. What tricks the <HI>Feti&s;&s;ero's</HI> may play in compounding this Water, I know not: but this kind of Tryal is frequent among them, and &s;eems to be a remainder of the old <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Tryal by the Waters of jealou&s;y, &s;poken of in the 5th.

<P>I Have already &s;poken of my fir&s;t going up the River to <HI>Cachao,</HI> and my returning back again to our Ships after a few days. There I lay on board for a great while, and &s;ickly for the mo&s;t part; yet not &s;o, but that I took a Boat and went a&s;hoar one where or other almo&s;t every day: and by this means I took as particular notice as I could of the Country, and have &s;upplied my own ob&s;er|vations with tho&s;e of our Merchants re&s;iding there, and other Per&s;ons of Judgment, and Inte|grity.</P>
<P>During this interval, Rice being dear at <HI>Cachao,</HI> as it had been for &s;ome time, both our Merchants and Natives were for making up a Fleet of &s;mall
<PB N="87" REF="95">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> Ve&s;&s;els, to fetch Rice from the Neighbouring Provinces, both for their own u&s;e and to &s;upply the Markets: and they never go in &s;ingle Ve&s;&s;els, for fear of Pirates, who infe&s;t the Coa&s;ts with their Canoas, and &s;helter them&s;elves among &s;eve|ral little I&s;lands, lying at the edge of the Ea&s;t Province, and bordering upon the Province of <HI>Tenan,</HI> whither the&s;e Merchants were bound.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Weldon</HI> was one who concerned him&s;elf in this expedition, hiring a Ve&s;&s;el and Seamen of the <HI>Tonquine&s;e,</HI> and &s;ending &s;ome of his own Men with them as a Guard, among whom I would very fain have gone, had I not been indi&s;po&s;ed. Mr. <HI>Ludford,</HI> who had liv'd &s;ometime at <HI>Cachao</HI> before our arrival, was another Undertaker, and went him&s;elf on board the Bark he had hired; but Cap|tain <HI>Weldon</HI> &s;taid behind at the City, yet took care to get a Commi&s;&s;ion from the Governour of the Ea&s;t-Province for his Ve&s;&s;el. In the Commi&s;&s;ion 'twas expre&s;t, that his Boat &s;hould be armed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> or other Weapons, and that his Men &s;hould re&s;i&s;t any that came to oppo&s;e them, or any Ve&s;|&s;els in their Company; and that they might kill and de&s;troy any Robbers that they met with. The Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Tenan</HI> lay mo&s;t within Land, thro' Creeks and narrow Channels, among the I&s;lands before-mentioned, which are &s;o many, and lye on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Bay &s;o thick together, and &s;o nigh the &s;hoar, that at a &s;mall di&s;tance off at Sea they appear to be part of the Main. This little <HI>Archipelago</HI> lies within the precincts of the Govern|our of the Ea&s;t-Province, from whom Captain <HI>Weldon</HI> had his Commi&s;&s;ion, and who was a very great Man in the Court of <HI>Tonquin.</HI> When the Fleet came to this place, &s;ome who lay here came forth; and they concluded they mu&s;t be the Pirates, come to &s;eize their Prey as at other times The&s;e always choo&s;e rather to take the outward|bound

He expected a reward for his pains, or at lea&s;t to be highly ap|plauded for it; but found him&s;elf mi&s;taken. For the Pri&s;oners ob&s;tinately denying what was al|ledged again&s;t them by Mr. <HI>Ludford,</HI> &s;aying they were poor Fi&s;hermen, they were immediately ac|quitted as very hone&s;t Per&s;ons, and Mr. <HI>Ludford</HI> was accu&s;ed for committing a Riot on Men who were about their lawful occa&s;ions.

But neither did this help him: for upon trying the matter at <HI>Cachao,</HI> whither 'twas carried by Appeal, Captain <HI>Weldon</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion &s;aved him: &s;o that Mr. <HI>Ludford</HI> was forced to pay the Money, which was more than he got by the Voyage. This might be a warning to him, how he meddled with <HI>Tonquin</HI> Pirates again; for it was not enough for him to plead that they came with an intent to rob him. Indeed if he had been robb'd, he might have been pitied by the Magi&s;trates on complaint of his misfortune: but yet it is very probable, that if he &s;hould have taken them in the very fact, po&s;&s;e&s;t of his Goods, the&s;e Vermin, would have had one hole or ano|ther to creep out at; &s;o corrupt are the great Men of this Kingdom. And indeed 'tis not improbable that the&s;e Fellows were Fi&s;hermen, and going a|bout their bu&s;ine&s;s: For there is good Fi&s;hing in all the Bay of <HI>Tonquin</HI> clear round it, and there are many Boats that go out a fi&s;hing, and the Fi&s;hermen are generally very hone&s;t and harmle&s;s Men; except now and then, they attempt to make a prize of &s;ome poor Ve&s;&s;el they meet, and can overcome by their numbers without fighting; for &s;uch an one they board, and &s;trip all the Men naked even to there Skin. Among the&s;e I&s;lands al&s;o, by report, their are plenty of Pearl Oy&s;ters, that have good Pearls in them; but the Seamen are di&s;couraged from fi&s;hing for them by the King, for he &s;eizeth on all he finds.

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> The&s;e Ve&s;&s;els were 5 or 6 weeks in their Voyage to and from <HI>Tenan:</HI> And at their return Captain <HI>Weldon</HI>'s Bark went not up to <HI>Cachao</HI> with the Rice, but unladed it into our Ship to &s;upply us. Soon after this I went a &s;econd time up to <HI>Cachao,</HI> not in a Boat as before, but on Foot along the Coun|try, being de&s;irous to &s;ee as much of it as I could: and I hired a <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> for about a Dollar to be my Guide. This, tho' but a &s;mall matter, was a great deal out of my Pocket, who had not above 2 Dollars in all, which I had gotten on board, by teaching &s;ome of our young Seamen Plain Sailing.</P>
<P>This was all I had to bear my own charges and my Guides; and 'twas the wor&s;e with me, becau&s;e I was forced to make &s;hort Journeys every Day by Rea&s;on of my Weakne&s;s: It was about the latter end of <HI>Nov.</HI> 1688, when we &s;et out. We kept on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the River, where we found the Roads pretty dry, yet in &s;ome places dirty enough. We ferry'd over &s;everal Creeks and Brooks running into the great River, whese are Ferry Boats always plying, which have a few Ca&s;h for their fare. The Feaver and Ague which I brought with me from <HI>Achin</HI> was gone: yet the Fruits I eat here, e&s;pecially the &s;mall Oranges, brought me into a Flux. However tho' I was but weak, yet I was not di&s;couraged from this Journey, being weary of lying &s;till, and impa|tient of &s;eeing &s;omewhat that might further gra|tify my curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>We found no Hou&s;es of Entertainment on the Road, yet at every Village we came we got Hou&s;e|room, and a Barbacue of &s;plit Bambooes to &s;leep on. The People were very civil, lending us an earthen Pot to dre&s;s Rice, or any thing el&s;e. U&s;ually after Supper, if the Day was not &s;hut in, I took a ramble about the Village, to &s;ee what was worth taking notice of, e&s;pecially the <HI>Pagoda</HI> of
<PB N="91" REF="99">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> the place. The&s;e had the Image of either an Hor&s;e, an Elephant, or both, &s;tanding with the Head looking out of the Doors: The <HI>Pagodas</HI> them&s;elves were but &s;mall and low. I &s;till made it dark Night before I returned to my Lodging, and then I laid me down to &s;leep. My Guide carried my Sea-Gown, which was my covering in the night, and my Pillow was a Log of Wood: but I &s;lept very well, tho' the weakne&s;s of my Body did now require better accommodation.</P>
<P>The third day after my &s;etting out, about 3 a Clock in the afternoon, I &s;aw before me a &s;mall Tower; &s;uch as I mentioned before, as erected for a time in honour of &s;ome great Per&s;on decea&s;ed. But I knew not then the meaning of it, for I had not &s;een the like before in the Country. As I came nearer to it, I &s;aw a Multitude of People, mo&s;t of them Men and Boys; and coming nearer &s;till, I &s;aw a great deal of Meat on the Stalls, that were plac'd at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the Tower. This made me conclude that it was &s;ome great Market, and that the Fle&s;h I &s;aw was for &s;ale: Therefore I went in among the Croud, as well to &s;ee the Tower as to buy &s;ome of the Meat for my Supper, it being now between 4 and 5 a Clock in the Afternoon. My Guide could not &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> neither could I &s;peak the <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> Lan|guage: So I a&s;kt him no que&s;tions about it; and he too went readily in with me; it may be not knowing my intent was to buy. Fir&s;t I went round the Tower and viewed it: It was four-&s;quare, each &s;ide about 8 foot broad: at the Ground the heighth of it was about 26 foot, but at the top &s;omewhat narrower than at the bottom. I &s;aw no door to enter into it: it &s;eemed to be very &s;lightly built, at lea&s;t covered with thin boards, which were all joyned clo&s;e together, and painted of a dark red|di&s;h colour. I then went on to the Stalls, which
<PB N="92" REF="100">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> had &s;heds built over them: and there I viewed the Fruits and Fle&s;h, each of which was ranged in order apart. I pa&s;t by abundance of Oranges packt up in Ba&s;kets, which I think were the faire&s;t I ever &s;aw, and for quantity more than I had &s;een gathered all the time I was at <HI>Tonquin.</HI> I pa&s;t by the&s;e, and &s;eeing no other Fruit, I came to the Fle&s;h-Stalls, where was nothing but Pork, and this al&s;o was all cut into quarters and &s;ides of Pork: I thought there might be 50 or 60 Hogs cut up thus, and all &s;eemed to be very good Meat. When I &s;aw that there was none of it in &s;mall pieces, fit for my u&s;e, I, as was cu&s;tomary in the Markets, took hold of a quarter, and made &s;igns to the Ma&s;ter of it, as I thought, to cut me a piece of 2 or 3 Pound. I was ignorant of any ceremony they were about, but the &s;uper&s;titious People &s;oon made me &s;en&s;ible of my errour: For they a&s;&s;aulted me on all &s;ides, buffeting me and renting my Cloaths, and one of them &s;natched away my Hat. My Guide did all he could to appea&s;e them, and dragg'd me out of the Crowd: Yet &s;ome &s;urly Fellows followed us, and &s;eemed by their Countenance and Ge&s;tures to threaten me; but my Guide at la&s;t pacify'd them and fetched my Hat, and we marched away as fa&s;t as we could. I could not be informed of my Guide what this meant; but &s;ometime after, when I was return'd to our Ship, the Guide's Brother, who &s;poke <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> told me, it was a Funeral Fea&s;t, and that the Tower was the Tomb which was to be burned; and &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men who lived there told me the &s;ame. This was the only Funeral Fea&s;t that ever I was at among them, and they gave me cau&s;e to remember it: but this was the wor&s;t u&s;age I received from any of them all the time that I was in the Country. When I was out of this trouble, my Guide and I marched for|wards.
<PB N="93" REF="101">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> I was both weary and hungry, and I think my appetite was rai&s;ed by &s;eeing &s;o much Food: For indeed at fir&s;t &s;ight of it I concluded to have had a good Supper; but now I was likely to &s;up only on Rice, or a Yam roa&s;ted, and two Eggs, as I us'd to do. For tho' there were Fowls to be bought at every Hou&s;e where I lay, yet my Pocket would not reach them; and for other Fle&s;h, there was none to be had, unle&s;s my way had lain thro' the Town when it was Market day with them.</P>
<P>Two Days after this I got with much ado to <HI>Hean,</HI> for my Flux encrea&s;ed, and my &s;trength decrea&s;ed. I pre&s;ently made towards the <HI>French</HI> Bi&s;hops, as the likelie&s;t place for me both to re&s;t at, and get larger Informations of the Country, from the <HI>European</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries, who&s;e &s;eat it is. The Bi&s;hop's Palace is a pretty neat low Hou&s;e, &s;tanding at the North end of the Town, by the &s;ide of the River. 'Tis encompa&s;&s;ed with a pretty high Wall, and has a large Gate to enter at. The Gate &s;tands fronting to the Street, and runs up with Hou&s;es on both &s;ides, and ends at the Palace. Within the Wall there is a &s;mall Yard, that goes round the Palace; and at the farther end of the Yard there are &s;mall lodging-rooms for the Ser|vants, and other nece&s;&s;ary Offices. The Hou&s;e it &s;elf is not very large nor high; it &s;tands not in the middle of the Yard, but rather neare&s;t the Gate, which Gate is open all day, but &s;hut in the Night. That part that fronts the Gate, has a pretty neat Room, which &s;eems to be de&s;igned for the reception of Strangers: for it has no communi|cation with any other Room in the Hou&s;e, tho' joyned to it as one building: the Door by which you enter it, fronts to the Gate, and this Dooor al&s;o &s;tands open all the day.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="102">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> When I came hither I entred the Gate, and &s;eeing no Body in the Yard, I went into that Room. At the Door thereof, I found a &s;mall Line hanging down, which I pull'd; and a Bell ringing within, gave notice of my being there: yet no Body appearing pre&s;ently, I went in and &s;ate down. There was a Table in the middle of the Room, and hand&s;ome Chairs, and &s;everal <HI>European</HI> Pictures hung upon the Walls.</P>
<P>It was not long before one of the Prie&s;ts came into the Room to me, and received me very ci|villy. With him I had a great deal of Di&s;cour&s;e: He was a <HI>French</HI> Man by Nation, but &s;poke <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> very well. It was chiefly in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> that we entertained each other, which I under|&s;tood much better than I could &s;peak: yet I a&s;k'd him Que&s;tions, and made a &s;hift to an&s;wer him to &s;uch Que&s;tions as he a&s;ked me; and when I was at a lo&s;s in my <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> I had recour&s;e to <HI>Latin,</HI> having &s;till &s;ome &s;matterings of what I learnt of it at School in my youth. He was very free to talk with me, and fir&s;t a&s;ked me my bu&s;ine&s;s thither? I told him that my bu&s;ine&s;s was to <HI>Cachao,</HI> where I had been once before: that then I went by Water, but now I was moved by my curio&s;ity to travel by Land, and that I could not pa&s;s by any <HI>Europeans</HI> without a Vi&s;it, e&s;pecially &s;uch a famous place as this. He a&s;ked me many other Que&s;tions, and particularly if I was a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick? I told him no, but falling then into a Di&s;cour&s;e about Re|ligion, he told me what Progre&s;s the Go&s;pel was like to make in the&s;e Ea&s;tern Nations. Fir&s;t he began with the <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;lands, and told me what I have related of that matter, in the 17 Chap|ter of my <HI>Voyage round the World,</HI> page 177, for this was the Per&s;on I there quoted, and from whom I had that Relation; as he told me he had it from the Friar, who wrote to him from <HI>Fort St. George.</HI> But
<PB N="95" REF="103">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> that Friar having been a Pa&s;&s;enger in Captain <HI>Weldon's</HI> Ship, from one of the <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;lands to <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> I a&s;kt the Captain's opinion of that relation &s;ince my writing that Book, and he gave me a quite contrary account of the People of <HI>Ni|cobar;</HI> that they were a very perver&s;e, fal&s;e and thievi&s;h People, and did not de&s;erve the good character the Friar gave of them.</P>
<P>But to proceed with the di&s;cour&s;e I had with the <HI>French</HI> Prie&s;t at <HI>Hean.</HI> He told me, that in <HI>Siom</HI> the Go&s;pel was in a very fair way to receive incouragement by the means of a <HI>French</HI> Bi&s;hop there, and &s;everal Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks he had with him there to a&s;&s;i&s;t him: That the great Mini&s;ter of State, <HI>Con&s;tant Falcon,</HI> had embraced the <HI>Ro|mi&s;h</HI> Faith; and that the King was very much inclined to it, the Courtiers al&s;o &s;eeming well enough plea&s;ed with it. In&s;omuch that 'twas hop'd that in a &s;hort time the whole Nation would be converted: And that tho' the Country People in general were again&s;t it, yet by the ex|ample of the King and his Court, the re&s;t might come over by degrees; e&s;pecially becau&s;e the Prie&s;ts had free Toleration to u&s;e their endeavours. As for <HI>Tonquin,</HI> he told me that the People in ge|neral were inclined to embrace the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Faith, but that the Government was wholly aver&s;e to it: that the Mi&s;&s;ionaries who lived here did not open|ly profe&s;s to be Teachers of their Doctrine, but that they lived here under the notion of Mer|chants, and not as Clergy-Men; that this was a great Ob&s;tacle to Chri&s;tianity, yet neverthele&s;s they found ways to draw the People from their Ig|norance: that at pre&s;ent they had about 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">000 Converts, and more coming in daily. He told me, that here were two Bi&s;hops, I think both <HI>French</HI> Men; one of them was entitled the Bi&s;hop of <HI>A&s;calon</HI> the other of <HI>Auran;</HI> and that here were
<PB N="96" REF="104">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> ten Prie&s;ts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and three more of the Natives of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> who had been ordain'd Popi&s;h Prie&s;ts. But &s;ince I have been informed, that the&s;e <HI>French</HI> Bi&s;hops were not &s;uffered to live at <HI>Cachao;</HI> neither may they at any time go thither without a Licence from the Governour; and &s;uch a Licence al&s;o mu&s;t be procur'd by the Favour of &s;ome <HI>Mandarin</HI> who lives at <HI>Cachao,</HI> for whom the Bi&s;hop or other Mi&s;&s;ionary is to perform &s;ome trivial Work or other. For the Mi&s;&s;ioners living here are purpo&s;e|ly &s;kill'd in mending Clocks, Watches, or &s;ome Mathematical In&s;truments, of which the Country People are Ignorant; and this gives them the op|portunity of being often &s;ent for to <HI>Cachao</HI> by the <HI>Mandarins:</HI> And when they are there, a &s;mall job that would not require above 5 or 6 Hours to per|form, they will be twice as many days about, pretending great difficulty in the work; by which means they take their liberty, privately to teach their Di&s;ciples that live there; and then al&s;o they enjoy them&s;elves with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Mer|chants, to whom they are always welcome.</P>
<P>As to the Converts the&s;e People have made, I have been credibly informed that they are chiefly of the very poor People, and that in the &s;carce times, their Alms of Rice have converted more than their preaching: and as to tho&s;e al&s;o who have been converted, as they call it, that is to Beads and new Images, and belief in the Pope, they have fallen off again, as Rice grew plentiful, and would no longer be Chri&s;tians than while the Prie&s;ts admini&s;tred Food to them. Yet I cannot think but that the&s;e People, who have &s;uch Notions of a &s;upreme Deity, might by the indu&s;try and example of good Men, be brought to embrace the Chri&s;tian Faith. But as things &s;tand at pre|&s;ent, it &s;eems very improbable that Chri&s;tianity &s;hould fructify there: For as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and
<PB N="97" REF="105">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> <HI>Dutch</HI> in the&s;e parts of the World are too loo&s;e Livers to gain Reputation to their Religion, &s;o are the other <HI>Europeans,</HI> I mean the Mi&s;&s;ionary Prie&s;ts, e&s;pecially the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> but very blind Teachers. But indeed as the Romani&s;ts are the only Men who compa&s;s Sea and Land to gain Pro&s;elytes, &s;o they may &s;eem to have one advantage over <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Mi|ni&s;ters in the&s;e Idolatrous Countries, that they pre|&s;ent them with &s;uch kind of Objects for Religi|ous Wor&s;hip as they have been u&s;ed to already: For the exchange is not great from <HI>Pagan</HI> Idols to Images of Saints, which may &s;erve altogether as well for the poor Souls they convert, who are guided only by &s;en&s;e. But then even here al&s;o, the&s;e People having been bred up in the belief of the goodne&s;s of their own Gods or Heroes, they will more hardly be brought over to change their own Idols for new ones, without &s;ome better Argu|ments to prove the&s;e to be more valuable, than the Mi&s;&s;ionaries ordinarily are able to afford them: and If I may freely &s;peak my opinion, I am apt to think, that the gro&s;s Idolatry of the Papi&s;ts is ra|ther a prejudice, than advantage to their Mi&s;&s;ions: and that their fir&s;t care &s;hould be to bring the People to be virtuous and con&s;iderate, and their next, to give them a plain Hi&s;tory and Scheme of the Fundmental Truths of Chri&s;tianity, and &s;hew them how agreeable they are to natural light, and how worthy of God.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>French</HI> Prie&s;t; he at length a&s;ked me if any of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships brought Pow|der to &s;ell? I told him, I thought not. Then he a&s;ked me if I knew the compo&s;ition of Powder? I an&s;wered that I had receipts how to make either Cannon or fine Powder, and told him the manner of the Compo&s;ition. Said he, I have the &s;ame receipts from <HI>France,</HI> and have tryed to make Powder, but could not; and therefore I think the
<PB N="98" REF="106">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> fault is in our Coals. Then he a&s;ked me many que&s;tions about the Coals, what were proper to be u&s;ed, but that I could not &s;atisfie him in. He de|&s;ired me to try to make a pound, and withal told me, that he had all the ingredients, and an Engine to mix them. I was ea&s;ily per&s;waded to try my &s;kill, which I had never yet tried, not knowing what I might be put to before I got to <HI>England;</HI> and having drank a gla&s;s or two of Wine with him, I went to work; and it &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that I plea&s;ed him extremely, and &s;atisfied my own de|&s;ire of trying the Receipt, and the Reader &s;hall have the Hi&s;tory of the Operation, if he plea&s;es. He brought me Sulphur and Salt-petre, and I weighed a portion of each of the&s;e, and of Coals I gathered up in the hearth, and beat to powder. While his Man mixed the&s;e in a little Engine, I made a &s;mall Sieve of Parchment, which I pricked full of Holes, with a &s;mall Iron made hot, and this was to corn it. I had 2 large Coco-nuts to roul in the Sieve, and work it thro' the holes to corn it. When it was dry we proved it, and it an&s;wer'd our expectation. The Receipt I had out of Captain <HI>Sturmey's Magazin</HI> of Arts.</P>
<P>The being &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in this put me afterwards on the renewing of Powder at <HI>Bencouli,</HI> when I was there Gunner of that Fort. There being then about 20 Barrels damnified, which was like mud, they took it out of the Ca&s;k, and put it into earthen Jars, that held about 8 Barrels a piece. The&s;e they call <HI>Montaban</HI> Jars, from a Town of that name in <HI>Pegu,</HI> whence they are brought and carried all over <HI>India.</HI> In the&s;e 'twas intended to &s;end the Powder to <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> to be renewed there: But I de&s;ired the Governour to let me fir&s;t try my &s;kill on it, becau&s;e we had but little Powder in the Fort, and might have wanted before any returns could be expected
<PB N="99" REF="107">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> from thence. The Salt-petre was &s;unk to the bottom of the Jars, but I mixt it and beat it al|together, and corned it with Sieves which I made of my own old Parchment Draughts. I made thus 8 Barrels full of very good Powder before I went from thence. The <HI>French</HI> Prie&s;t told me in conclu&s;ion, that the Grandees make all their own Powder; and &s;ince I have been informed, that the Soldiers make Powder, as I have already &s;aid.</P>
<P>I &s;pent the remainder of the day in the Palace with the Prie&s;t. He told me that the Bi&s;hop was not well, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have &s;een him: and that becau&s;e it was a Fi&s;h day, I could not expect &s;uch entertainment, as I might have had on another day; yet he ordered a Fowl to be broiled for my Dinner, and I dined by my &s;elf. In the E|vening he &s;ent me out of the Palace, de&s;iring to be excu&s;ed, that he could not entertain me all night: yet he ordered his Man to lodge me in a <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> Chri&s;tian Hou&s;e not far from thence. The People were civil, but very poor, and my Lodg|ing &s;uch as I had met with on the Road. I have &s;ince been told, that the new Chri&s;tians come to do their Devotion in the Palace at Night, and for that rea&s;on probably, I was &s;o &s;oon di&s;|mi&s;t.</P>
<P>I was now again pretty well refre&s;hed, and might have gone to <HI>Cachao</HI> City a foot: but fearing my &s;trength, I cho&s;e to go by Water. Therefore I &s;ent back my Guide: yet before he departed back to our Ships, he bargained with a <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> Water|man for my Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Cachao.</HI></P>
<P>The Tide not &s;erving pre&s;ently to imbark, I walked about the Town, and &s;pent the Day in viewing it: in the Evening I embarked, and they choo&s;e an Evening for coolne&s;s, rowing
<PB N="100" REF="108">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> all night. The Boat was about the bigne&s;s of a <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> Wherry, and was u&s;ed purpo&s;ely to carry Pa&s;&s;engers, having a &s;mall covering over-head to keep them dry when it rained. There were 4 or 5 more of the&s;e Boats, that went up this Tide full of Pa&s;&s;engers. In our Boat were about 20 Men and Women, be&s;ides 4 or 6 that rowed us. The Women cho&s;e their places and &s;ate by them&s;elves, and they had much re&s;pect &s;hewed them: but the Men &s;towed clo&s;e together, without &s;hewing any re&s;pect more to one than to another, yet all very civil. I thru&s;t in among the thicke&s;t of them at fir&s;t, but my Flux would not &s;uffer me to re&s;t long in a place. About midnight we were &s;et a&s;hore to refre&s;h our &s;elves at a Baiting place, where there were a few Hou&s;es clo&s;e by the Rivers &s;ide, and the people up, with Candles lighted, Arack and Tea, and little &s;pits of Meat, and other Pro|vi&s;ions ready dre&s;t, to receive us. For the&s;e were all Hou&s;es of entertainment, and probably got their living by entertaining Pa&s;&s;engers. We &s;tayed here about an hour, and then entered again on our Boat, and rowed forwards. The Pa&s;&s;en|gers &s;pent the time in merry Di&s;cour&s;e, or Singing, after their way, tho' to us it &s;eems like crying; but I was mute for want of a per&s;on I could conver&s;e with. About 8 or 9 a clock the next day I was &s;et a&s;hore: the re&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;engers remained in the Boat, but whither they were bound I know not, nor whither the Boat went quite up to <HI>Cachao.</HI> I was now 5 or 6 mile &s;hort of the City, but in a good path: for the Land here was pretty high, le|vel and &s;andy, and the Road plain and dry, and I reached <HI>Cachao</HI> by Noon. I pre&s;ently went to one Mr. <HI>Bowyers</HI> Hou&s;e, who was a free Merchant, with whom Captain <HI>Weldon</HI> lodged; and &s;taid with them a few days: but &s;o weak with my Flux, which daily encrea&s;ed that I was &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e able to

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> go about; and &s;o was forced to learn by others, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;everal particulars relating to this place. This my weakne&s;s, joyned with my di&s;appointment; for I found that I was not like to be employed in any Voyage to the Neighbouring Countries, as it had been purpo&s;ed to me, made me very de&s;irous of returning back again, as &s;oon as might be: and it hapned opportunely, that Captain <HI>Weldon</HI> had by this time done his bu&s;ine&s;s, and was preparing for his departure.</P>
<P>I went therefore down the River again to our Ships, in a Ve&s;&s;el our Merchants had hired, to carry their Goods aboard from <HI>Cachao.</HI> Among other freight, there were 2 Bells of about 500 weight each, which had been ca&s;t at <HI>Cachao</HI> by the <HI>Tonquine&s;e,</HI> for my Lord <HI>Falcon,</HI> the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s chief Mini&s;ter of State, and for the u&s;e of &s;ome of the Chri&s;tian Churches in <HI>Siam.</HI> The per&s;on who be&s;poke them, and was to carry them, was Captain <HI>Brew&s;ter,</HI> who had not very long before come from <HI>Siam</HI> in a Ship of that King's, and had been ca&s;t away on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> but had &s;aved mo&s;t of his Goods. With the&s;e he traded at <HI>Cachao,</HI> and among other goods he had purcha&s;ed to return with to <HI>Siam,</HI> were the&s;e 2 Bells, all which he &s;ent down to be put on Board Captain <HI>Weldon</HI>'s Ship. But the Bark was no &s;ooner come to <HI>Hean,</HI> in going down the River, but the Gover|nor of <HI>Hean</HI>'s Officers came on board the Bark and &s;eized the 2 Bells in behalf of the chief of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory; who under&s;tanding they were de|&s;igned for the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> which they were not &s;o &s;ure of as to the re&s;t of the goods, and the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> being then at War with the <HI>Siamers,</HI> he made this his pretence for &s;eizing them, and got the Governor to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with his Authority: and the Bells were accordingly carried a&s;hore, and kept at <HI>Hean:</HI> This was thought a very &s;trange

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> action of the chief of the Factory, to &s;eize Goods as belonging to the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> while they were in a River of <HI>Tonquin:</HI> but he was a per&s;on but meanly qualified for the &s;tation he was in. Indeed had he been a man of &s;pirit, he might have been &s;erviceable in getting a Trade with <HI>Japan,</HI> which is a very rich one, and much cove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by the Ea&s;t|ern people them&s;elves as well as <HI>Europeans.</HI> For while I was there, there were Merchants came every year from <HI>Japan</HI> to <HI>Tonquin;</HI> and by &s;ome of the&s;e our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory might probably have &s;et|tled a Core&s;pondence and Traffick. but he who was little qualified for the &s;tation he was in, was le&s;s &s;it for any new undertaking: and tho' men ought not to run incon&s;iderately into new di&s;cove|ries or undertakings, yet where there is a pro&s;pect of profit I think it not ami&s;s for Merchants to try for a Trade, for if our Ance&s;tors had been as dull as we have been of late, 'tis probable we had ne|ver known the way &s;o much as to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> but mu&s;t have been beholden to our Neighbours, for all the product of tho&s;e Ea&s;tern Nations. What care was formerly taken to get us a Trade into the <HI>E. Indies,</HI> and othet Countries? What pains parti|cularly did &s;ome take to find out the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> by doubling the North <HI>Cape,</HI> and a way thence by land Trade into <HI>Per&s;ia?</HI> but now, as if we were cloy'd with Trade, we &s;it &s;till contented, &s;aying with <HI>Cato, Non minor e&s;t virtus quam quaerere parta tuiri.</HI> This was the &s;aying of an eminent Merchant of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company to me: but by his leave, our Neighbours have encroached on us, and that in our times too. However, 'tis certainly for the intere&s;t of our Merchants to imploy &s;it men in their Facto|ries, &s;ince the reputation of the Company ri&s;eth or falls by the di&s;creet management, or ill conduct of the Agents. Nor is it enough for the chief of a Factory to be a good Merchant, and an hone&s;t
<PB N="103" REF="111">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> man: for tho' the&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications, yet the Governour, or chief of the Factory ought to know more than barely how to buy, &s;ell, and keep Accompts: E&s;pecially where other <HI>European</HI> Merchants re&s;ide among them, or trade to the &s;ame places; for they keep a diligent Eye on the management of our Affairs, and are always ready to take all Advantages of our Mi&s;-improvements. Neither ought this care to be neglected where we have the Trade to our &s;elves, for there ought to be a fair under&s;tanding between us and the Na|tives, and care taken, that they &s;hould have no rea&s;on to complain of unju&s;t dealings, as I could &s;hew where there has been; but 'tis an invidious &s;ubject, and all that I aim at is to give a caution. But to the matter in hand, it &s;eemed to me that our Factory at <HI>Tonquin</HI> might have got a Trade with <HI>Japan:</HI> and to <HI>China</HI> as much as they plea&s;ed. I confe&s;s the continual Wars between <HI>Tonquin</HI> and <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> were enough to ob&s;truct the de&s;igns of making a Voyage to this la&s;t: and tho&s;e other places of <HI>Champa</HI> and <HI>Cambodia</HI> as they are le&s;s known, &s;o was it more unlikely &s;till to make thither any profit|able Voyages: yet po&s;&s;ibly the difficulties here al&s;o are not &s;o great, but re&s;olution and indu&s;try would overcome them; and the profit would abundantly compen&s;ate the trouble.</P>
<P>But to proceed, we found there was no reco|vering the Bells: &s;o we fell down from <HI>Hean</HI> to our Ships: and Captain <HI>Weldon</HI> coming to us in a few days, and Captain <HI>Brewster</HI> with him, to go as a Pa&s;&s;enger in his &s;hip, together with one or two more; and 2 Ships who came with us being al&s;o ready for their departure, we all weighed anchor, and took leave of <HI>Tonquin.</HI></P>

<PB N="105" REF="113">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> now, as we had on the We&s;t &s;ide of it, at our co|ming into the Bay.</P>
<P>Coming out of the Bay of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> we &s;tood away Southward, having the Sholes of <HI>Pracel</HI> on our Larboard, and the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Cochinchina, Cham|pa,</HI> and <HI>Cambodia</HI> on our Starboard. I have ju&s;t men|tioned the&s;e Kingdoms in my former Volume; and here I have but little to &s;ay of them, having only &s;ail'd by them. But not altogether to fail the Readers expectation, I &s;hall give a brief account of one or two particulars relating to <HI>Cambodia:</HI> for as to <HI>Champa</HI> I have nothing material to &s;peak; and <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> I have already &s;poken of in this Volume, as I went to <HI>Tonquin.</HI></P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Cambodia</HI> &s;eems to be much &s;uch a kind of Country within Land, as the lower parts of <HI>Tonquin:</HI> low Land, very woody, and little inhabited, lying on each &s;ide a great River that comes from the North a great way, and falls into the Sea over again&s;t <HI>Pulo Condore.</HI> I know not the particular product of <HI>Cambodia,</HI> but in the Ve&s;&s;els mentioned in my former Vol. p. 399. as taken at <HI>Pulo Uby,</HI> and which came thither from <HI>Cambodia;</HI> there were be&s;ides Rice, Dragons Blood, Lack, in great Jars, but it looked blacki&s;h and thick; and the yellow purging Gum, which we from thence call <HI>Cambodia,</HI> in great Cakes, but I know not whence they get it. This River and Kingdom (if it be one) is but little known to our Nation, yet &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men have been there; particularly Captain <HI>Williams</HI> and Captain <HI>Howel,</HI> the la&s;t of whom I came acquainted with &s;ome time after this at <HI>Fort St George,</HI> and I had of him the following account, the particulars of which I have al&s;o had confirmed by the Seamen who where with them.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Captains, with many more <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men, had been for &s;ome time in the &s;ervice of the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> and each of them commanded a
<PB N="106" REF="114">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> &s;tout Frigat of his, mann'd chiefly with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> born at <HI>Siam.</HI> The&s;e the King of <HI>Siam</HI> &s;ent again&s;t &s;ome Pyrates, who made &s;poyl of his Subjects trading in the&s;e Seas, and ne&s;t|ed them&s;elves in an I&s;land up the River of <HI>Cambodia.</HI> Captain <HI>Howel</HI> told me, that they found this River very large, e&s;pecially at its mouth; that 'tis deep and navigable for very great Ve&s;&s;els, 60 or 70 Leagues up, and that its depth and widene&s;s ex|tended much further up, for ought we know: but &s;o far they went up, at this time, with their Ships. The Cour&s;e of the River is generally from North to South: and they found the Land low on each &s;ide, with many large Creeks and Branches, and in &s;ome places con&s;iderable I&s;lands. They bended their Cour&s;e up that branch which &s;eemed mo&s;t con&s;iderable, having the Tide of flood with them, and the River commonly &s;o wide, as to give them room to turn or make Angles where the bending of the River was &s;uch as to receive a con|trary Ea&s;t, or South-Ea&s;t Sea-Wind. The&s;e Reaches or Bendings of the River Ea&s;t and We&s;t were very rare; at lea&s;t &s;o as to make their Cour&s;e be again&s;t the Sea-wind, which commonly blew in their Stern, and &s;o fre&s;h, that with it they could &s;tem the Tide of Ebb. But in the night when the Land-winds came, they anchored, and lay &s;till till about 10 or 11 a Clock the next day, at which time the Sea-breezes u&s;ually &s;prang up again, and ena|bled them to continue their Cour&s;e, till they came to the I&s;land, where the Pirates inhabited. They pre&s;ently began to fire at them, and landing their Men, routed them, and burnt their Hou&s;es and For|tifications; and taking many Pri&s;oners, returned again.</P>
<P>The&s;e Piratical People were by Nation <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> who when the <HI>Tartars</HI> conquer'd their Country, fled from thence in their own Ships: as cho&s;ing
<PB N="107" REF="115">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> rather to live any were free, than to &s;ubmit to the <HI>Tartars.</HI> The&s;e it &s;eems in their flight bent their Cour&s;e towards this Country, and finding the River of <HI>Cambodia</HI> open before them, they made bold to enter, and &s;ettle on the I&s;land before men|tioned. There they built a Town, and fenced it round about with a kind of Wood-pile, or Wall of great Timber Trees laid along, of the thickne&s;s of 3 or 4 of the&s;e Trees, and of about as many in heighth. They were provided with all &s;orts of Planters In&s;truments, and the Land hereabouts was excellent good, as our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-men told me, &s;o that 'tis like they might have lived here happily enough, had their inclinations led them to a quiet Life: but they brought Arms along with them, and cho&s;e to u&s;e them, rather than their in&s;tru|ments of Husbandry: and they lived therefore mo&s;tly by rapin, pillaging their Neighbours, who were more addicted to traffick than fighting. But the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Subjects having been long harra&s;&s;ed by them at Sea, he fir&s;t &s;ent &s;ome Forces by Land to drive them out of their Fort: till not &s;ucceeding that way, he entirely routed them by &s;ending the&s;e 2 Ships up the River. The 2 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captains having thus effected their bu&s;ine&s;s, re|turned out of the River with many Pri&s;oners: but the South We&s;t Mon&s;oon being already &s;et in, they could not pre&s;ently return to <HI>Siam,</HI> and therefore went to <HI>Macao</HI> in <HI>China;</HI> as well to wait for the N. Ea&s;t Mon&s;oon, as to ingratiate them&s;elves with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who they thought would be plea&s;ed with the Conque&s;t which they had made over the&s;e <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Pyrates. They were well entertained there by the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Governor, and gave him their Pri&s;oners: and upon the &s;hifting of the Mon&s;oon, they returned to <HI>Siam.</HI> There they were received with great applau&s;e. Nor was this the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful expedition the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have
<PB N="108" REF="116">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> made in the K. of <HI>Siam</HI>'s &s;ervice.

Some hun|dreds of them got together, all well armed: and the&s;e &s;truck a dread into the hearts of the <HI>Siamites,</HI> none of whom were able to &s;tand before them; till <HI>Con&s;tant Falcon</HI> the chief Mini&s;ter, commanded the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that were then in the King's &s;ervice to march again&s;t them, which they did with &s;ucce&s;s, tho' with &s;ome con&s;iderable lo&s;s. For the&s;e &s;ervices the King gave every year to each of them, a great Silk Coat, on which were ju&s;t 13 buttons. Tho&s;e of the chief Commanders were of Ma&s;&s;y Gold, and tho&s;e of the inferior Officers were of Silver Plate. This expedition again&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|rats was about the year 1687: the other broyl with the <HI>Bugga&s;&s;es</HI> was, as I take it, &s;ome time before.</P>
<P>But to proceed with our Voyage, we &s;till kept our way Southward, and in company together, till we came about <HI>Pulo Condore;</HI> but then Captain <HI>Pool</HI> parted from us, &s;tanding more directly South for the Streights of <HI>Sundy:</HI> and we &s;teered more to the We&s;tward, to go thro' the Streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI> thro' which we came before. Captain <HI>Brew&s;ter</HI> and another of our Pa&s;&s;engers began now to be in fear that the King of <HI>Siam</HI> would &s;end Ships to lye at the mouth of the Streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI> and intercept our pa&s;&s;age, becau&s;e there was a War broke out between the <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company and that Prince. This &s;eemed the more likely, becau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> at this time were imployed in that King's &s;ervice, by the means of a <HI>French</HI> Bi&s;hop
<PB N="109" REF="117">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> and other <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks;</HI> who were &s;triving to con|vert the King and People to Chri&s;tianity, thro' the Intere&s;t they had got in <HI>Con&s;tant Falcon.</HI> Particu|larly they were affraid, that the King of <HI>Siam</HI> would &s;end the 2 Ships before mentioned, which Captain <HI>Williams,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Howel</HI> had commanded a little be|fore, to lye at the we&s;t end of the Streights mouth; but probably manned with <HI>French</HI> Men and <HI>French</HI> Commanders, to take us. Now tho' this made but little impre&s;&s;ion on the Minds of our Commanders and Officers, yet &s;o it hapned, that we had &s;uch thick dark weather, when we came near the fir&s;t Entrance of the Streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI> which was that we came by, and by which we meant to return, that we thought it not &s;afe to &s;tand in at night, and &s;o lay by till morning. The next day we &s;aw a Jonk to the Southward, and cha&s;ed her; and having &s;poke with her we made Sail, and &s;tood to the We&s;tward to pa&s;s the Streights, and making the Land, we found we were to the Southward of the Streights fir&s;t mouth, and were gotten to the Souther mo&s;t Entrance, near the <HI>Sumatra</HI> &s;hore: but Captain <HI>Lacy,</HI> who cho&s;e to go the old way, made &s;ail again to the Northward, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed nearer the <HI>Malacca</HI> &s;hore by the <HI>Sincapore,</HI> the way we went before. His was al&s;o the be&s;t and neare&s;t way: bBut Captain <HI>Weldon</HI> was willing to &s;a|tisfie his curio&s;ity, and try a new Pa&s;&s;age: which we got thro', tho' we had but little depth of Water: and this Entrance we pa&s;t is called <HI>Brewer's</HI> Streights.</P>
<P><HI>Brewer's</HI> Streights are &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ed by &s;mall Ships, that &s;ail from <HI>Batavia</HI> to <HI>Malacca,</HI> becau&s;e for them it is a nearer cut, than to run &s;o far as <HI>Pulo Timaon,</HI> or the Streights of <HI>Sincapore.</HI> In this Channel, tho' in &s;ome places we found but 14 or 15 foot Water, yet the bottom was &s;oft Oaze: and it lies &s;o among I&s;lands, that there cannot go a

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> great Sea. Captain <HI>Weldon</HI> had al&s;o a <HI>Dutch</HI>-man aboard who had been this way, and he profe&s;&s;ing to know the Channel, incouraged our Captain to try it, which we affected very well, tho &s;ometimes we had but little more water than we drew. This made us make but an ea&s;y Sail, and therefore we were 7 or 8 days before we arrived at <HI>Malacca;</HI> but Captain <HI>Lacy</HI> was there 2 or 3 days before us.</P>
<P>Here we fir&s;t heard of the Death of <HI>Con&s;tant Fal|con,</HI> for whom Captain <HI>Brew&s;ter</HI> &s;eemed to be much concerned. There al&s;o we found, be&s;ides &s;everal <HI>Dutch</HI> Sloops, and our Companion Captain <HI>Lacy,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el of 35 or 40 Tuns. This Ve&s;&s;el was bought by one Captain <HI>John&s;on,</HI> who was &s;ent by the Governor of <HI>Bencouli,</HI> in a &s;mall Sloop, to trade about the I&s;land of <HI>Sumatra</HI> for Pepper, but Captain <HI>John&s;on</HI> being killed, the Sloop was brought hither by one Mr. <HI>Wells.</HI></P>
<P>Being thus in&s;en&s;ibly fallen into the mention of this Captain <HI>John&s;on;</HI> and intending to defer what little I have to &s;ay of <HI>Malacca,</HI> till my coming thi|ther again from <HI>Achin,</HI> I &s;hall be&s;tow the re&s;t of this Chapter in &s;peaking of this Man's Tragedy, and other occurrences relating to it; which tho' of no great moment in them&s;elves, yet the Circum&s;tances I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to relate with them, may be of u&s;e to the giving &s;ome &s;mall light into the &s;tate of the oppo&s;ite Coa&s;t of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> which was the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ne of what I am going to &s;peake of: for tho' I &s;hall have other occa&s;ion to &s;peak of <HI>Achin</HI> and <HI>Bencouli,</HI> yet I &s;hall not have opportunity to &s;ay any thing of this part of that I&s;land, oppo&s;ite to <HI>Malacca,</HI> unle&s;s I do it here. To go on therefore with his Story, it &s;eems Captain <HI>John&s;on</HI> was part owner of the &s;mall <HI>Bencouli</HI> Sloop: but thinking it too &s;mall for his turn, he came to <HI>Malacca,</HI> intending to buy a larger Sloop of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> if he could light of a bargain. He had
<PB N="111" REF="119">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> the be&s;t part of a thou&s;and Dollars in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mo|ney aboard, for which one may purcha&s;e a good Sloop here: for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as I have before ob&s;erv'd, do often buy Proe-bottoms for a &s;mall matter, of the <HI>Malayans,</HI> e&s;pecially of the People of <HI>Jihore,</HI> and convert them into Sloops, either for their own u&s;e, or to &s;ell. Of the&s;e &s;ort of Ve&s;&s;els therefore the <HI>Dutch</HI>-men of <HI>Malacca</HI> have plenty, and can afford good pennyworths; and doubtle&s;s it was for this rea&s;on that Captain <HI>John&s;on</HI> came hither to purcha&s;e a Sloop. Here he met with a bargain, not &s;uch a Proe bottom reformed, but an old ill &s;haped thing, yet &s;uch a one as plea&s;ed him. The <HI>Dutch</HI>-man who &s;old him this Ve&s;&s;el, told him withal, that the Government did not allow any &s;uch dealings with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> tho' they might wink at it: and that therefore the &s;afe&s;t way for them both to keep out of trouble, would be to run over to the other &s;ide of the Streights, to a Town called <HI>Bencalis,</HI> on <HI>Sumatra;</HI> where they might &s;afely buy and &s;ell, or exchange without any notice taken of them. Cap|tain <HI>John&s;on</HI> accepting the offer, they &s;ailed both together over to <HI>Bencalis,</HI> a <HI>Malayan</HI> Town on that Coa&s;t, commanding the Country about it. There they came to an anchor, and Captain <HI>John&s;on</HI> paying the price agreed on for the Ve&s;&s;el, he had her deliver'd to him. The <HI>Dutch</HI>-man immediate|ly returned over to <HI>Malacca</HI> again, leaving Captain <HI>John&s;on</HI> with 2 Ve&s;&s;els under his Command, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sloop that he brought from <HI>Bencouli,</HI> and this new-bought Ve&s;&s;el. The <HI>Bencouli</HI> Sloop he &s;ent into a large River hard by, to Trade with the <HI>Malayans</HI> for Pepper, under the Command of Mr. <HI>Wells.</HI> He was no Seaman; but a pretty intelligent Per&s;on, that came fir&s;t out of <HI>England</HI> as a Soldier, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;erve the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company in the I&s;land <HI>Santa Helena.</HI> He liv'd &s;ome time very meanly in that <HI>I&s;land,</HI> but having an a&s;piring mind, he left that poor, but

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> healthy place, to &s;erve the Company at <HI>Bencouli;</HI> which tho' 'tis accounted the mo&s;t unhealthy place of any that we trade to, yet the hopes of preferment engaged him to remove thither. After &s;ome &s;tay there, he was &s;ent with Captain <HI>John&s;on</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this Pepper Expedition; more becau&s;e he could u&s;e his Pen, than his Hands in Sea &s;ervice. He had 3 or 4 raw Seamen with him to work the Sloop up into the River. Captain <HI>John&s;on</HI> &s;tayed near <HI>Bencalis</HI> to fit his new Ve&s;&s;el: for with other nece&s;&s;aries &s;he wanted a new Bolt&s;prit, which he intended to cut here, having a Carpenter with him for that purpo&s;e; as al&s;o to repair and fit her to his mind. He had al&s;o a few other raw Seamen, but &s;uch as would have made better Landmen, they having &s;erved the King of <HI>Siam</HI> as Soldiers: and they were but lately come from thence with the <HI>French,</HI> who were forced to leave that Country. But here in the <HI>Indies,</HI> our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are forced for want of better, to make u&s;e of any Seamen &s;uch as they can get, and indeed our Merchants are often put hard to it for want of Seamen. Here are indeed <HI>La&s;cars</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Seamen enough to be hired; and the&s;e they often make u&s;e of: yet they always covet an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man or 2 in a Ve&s;&s;el to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. Not but that the&s;e <HI>La&s;cars</HI> are &s;ome of them indifferent good Sailors, and might do well enough: but an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man will be accounted more faithful, to be employed on mat|ters of moment; be&s;ide the more free Conver&s;ation that may be expected from them, during the term of the Voyage. So that tho' oft times their <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men are but ordinary Sailors, yet they are pro|moted to &s;ome charge of which they could not be &s;o capable any where but in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> The&s;e Seamen would be in a manner wholly u&s;ele&s;s in <HI>Europe,</HI> where we meet with more frequent and hard &s;torms, but here they &s;erve indifferent well,
<PB N="113" REF="121">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> e&s;pecially to go and come with the Mon&s;oons; but enough of that.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wells</HI> being gone to purcha&s;e Pepper, Capt. <HI>John&s;on</HI> went a&s;hore about 5 or 6 Leagues from <HI>Ben|calis</HI> Town with his Carpenter, to cut a Bolt&s;prit; there being there plenty of Timber Trees fit for his purpo&s;e. He &s;oon cho&s;e one to his mind, and cut it down. He and his Carpenter wrought on it the fir&s;t and &s;econd days without mole&s;tation. The 3d. day they were both &s;et upon by a band of armed <HI>Malayans,</HI> who killed them both. In the evening the Sailors who were left aboard, lookt out for their Commander to come off: but night approaching without &s;eeing or hearing from him. This put them in &s;ome doubt of his &s;afety; for they were &s;en&s;ible enough, that the <HI>Malayans</HI> that inhabited thereabouts were very treacherous: as indeed all of them are, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who have but little Commerce with Strangers: and there|fore all people ought to be very careful in dealing with them, &s;o as to give them no advantage; and then they may Trade &s;afe enough.</P>
<P>There were but 4 Seamen aboard Captain <HI>John|&s;on's</HI> Sloop. The&s;e being terrified by the ab&s;ence of their Commander, and &s;u&s;pecting the truth, were now very apprehen&s;ive of their own &s;afeties. They charged their Guns, and kept them&s;elves on their guards, expecting to be a&s;&s;aulted by the <HI>Malayans.</HI> They had 2 Blunderbu&s;&s;es, and 3 or 4 Mu&s;kets: each man took one in his Hand, with a Caduce-box at his Wa&s;te, and looked out &s;harp for fear of any Enemy. While they were thus on their guard, the <HI>Malayans</HI> in 6 or 8 Canoas came very &s;ilently to attack the Sloop. They were about 40 or 50 Men, armed with Lances and Cre&s;&s;es. The darkne&s;s of the night favoured their de&s;igns, and they were even aboard before the Seamen per|ceived them. Then the&s;e began to Fire, and the
<PB N="114" REF="122">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> Enemy darted their Lances aboard, and boarding the Ve&s;&s;el, they entred her over the Prow. The Seamen re&s;olutely defended her, and drove them overboard again. Of the 4 Seamen, 2 were de&s;|perately wounded in the fir&s;t attack. The <HI>Malay|ans</HI> took fre&s;h Courage and entred again; and the 2 Seamen who were not wounded, betook them|&s;elves to clo&s;e quarters in the Steerage; and there being Loop-holes to fire out at, they repul&s;ed the <HI>Malayans</HI> again, forcing them into their Canoas. There bellies being now pretty full, they returned a&s;hore without hopes of conquering the Sloop. The poor Seamen were &s;till in fear, and kept watch all night; intending to &s;ell their Lives as dear as they could, if they had been attacked again. For they might not, neither did they expect quarter, from the&s;e Salvage <HI>Malayans:</HI> but they were no more a&s;&s;aulted. The&s;e two that were wounded, dyed in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e next day the 2 Seamen got up their Anchor, and run as nigh the Town of <HI>Bencalis</HI> as they could, it may be within half a mile. There they An|chor'd again, and made &s;igns for the People to come aboard. It was not long before the <HI>Shaban|der</HI> or chief Magi&s;trate of the Town came off: to him they told all their misfortunes, and de&s;ired him to protect them, becau&s;e they were not of &s;ufficient &s;trength to hold out again&s;t another attack. The <HI>Shabander</HI> &s;eemed very &s;orry for what had hapned, and told them withal, that he could not help what was pa&s;t, for that the People that did it were wild unruly Men, not &s;ubject to Government, and that it was not in his power to &s;uppre&s;s them: but that as long as they lay there &s;ome of his men &s;hould lye aboard to &s;ecure the Ship; and he, in the mean time, would &s;end a Canoa to their con|&s;ort Mr. <HI>Wells,</HI> to give him an account how things went. Accordingly he left 10 or 12 of his own

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> <HI>Malayans</HI> aboard the Bark, and &s;ent a Letter writ|ten by the Seamen to Mr. <HI>Wells;</HI> who was, as I have &s;aid, dealing with the Natives for Pepper, in a River at &s;ome di&s;tance.</P>
<P>It was 2 or 3 days before Mr. <HI>Wells</HI> came to them. He had not then received the Letter, and therefore they &s;u&s;pected the <HI>Shabander</HI> of fal&s;hood; tho' his men were yet very kind, and &s;erviceable to the 2 Seamen. Mr. <HI>Wells</HI> had heard nothing of their di&s;a&s;ters, but returned for want of Trade; at lea&s;t &s;uch a full Trade as he expected. For tho' here is Pepper growing, yet not &s;o much as might allure any one to &s;eek after it: for the <HI>Dutch</HI> are &s;o near, that none can come to Trade among them but by their permi&s;&s;ion. And tho' the Natives them&s;elves were never &s;o willing to Trade with any Nation, as indeed they are, yet the Dutch could &s;oon hin|der it, even by de&s;troying them, if in order to it they &s;hould &s;et them&s;elves to produce much Pepper. Such &s;mall quantities as they do at pre&s;ent rai&s;e up, or procure from other parts of the I&s;land, is lickt by the Dutch, or by their friends of <HI>Bencalis</HI> for them: for the Town of <HI>Bencalis</HI> being the princi|pal of the&s;e parts, and &s;o nigh <HI>Malacca,</HI> as only parted by the narrow Sea or Streights, 'tis vi&s;ited by the Dutch in their &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;eems wholly to depend on a Trade with that Nation, not daring to Trade with any be&s;ides: and I judge it is by the friend&s;hip of the Town, that the Dutch drive a &s;mall Trade for Pepper in the&s;e parts, and by it al&s;o vend any of their own Commodities: and the&s;e al&s;o trading with their Neighbours into the Country, do bring their Cmmodities hither, Where the Dutch come for them. The People of <HI>Bencalis</HI> therefore, tho' they are <HI>Malayans,</HI> as the re&s;t of the Country, yet they are civil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nough, engaged thereto by Trade: for the more Trade, the more civility; and on the contrary,
<PB N="116" REF="124">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> the le&s;s Trade the more barbarity and inhumanity. For Trade has a &s;trong influence upon all People, who have found the &s;weet of it, bringing with it &s;o many of the Conveniencies of Life as it does. And I believe that even the poor <HI>Americans,</HI> who have not yet ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of it, might be allured to it by an hone&s;t and ju&s;t Commerce: even &s;uch of them as do yet &s;eem to covet no more than a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of meat and drink, and a clout to cover their nakedne&s;s. That large Continent hath yet Millions of Inhabitants, both on the <HI>Mexi|can</HI> and <HI>Peruvian</HI> parts, who are &s;till ignorant of Trade: and they would be fond of it, did they once experience it; tho' at the pre&s;ent they live happy enough, by enjoying &s;uch fruits of the Earth, as nature hath be&s;towed on tho&s;e places, where their Lot is fallen: and it may be they are happier now, than they may hereafter be, when more known to the <HI>Avaritious World.</HI> For with Trade they will be in danger of meeting with oppre&s;&s;ion: men not being content with a free Traffick, and a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable gain, e&s;pecially in the&s;e remote Countries: but they mu&s;t have the Current run altogether in their own Channel, tho' to the de|priving the poor Natives they deal with, of their natural Liberty: as if all mankind were to be ruled by their Laws. The I&s;lands of <HI>Sumatra</HI> and <HI>Java</HI> can &s;ufficiently witne&s;s this; the Dutch having in a manner ingro&s;t all the Trade of tho&s;e, and &s;everal of the Neighbouring Countries to them|&s;elves: not that they are able to &s;upply the Natives with a quarter of what they want, but becau&s;e they would have all the produce of them at their own di&s;po&s;al. Yet even in this they are &s;hort, and may be &s;till more di&s;appointed of the Pepper Trade if other People would &s;eek for it. For the greate&s;t part of the I&s;land of <HI>Sumatra</HI> propagates this Plant, and the Natives would readily comply with any
<PB N="117" REF="125">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> who would come to Trade with them, notwith|&s;tanding the great endeavours the <HI>Dutch</HI> make again&s;t it: for this I&s;land is &s;o large, populous, and pro|ductive of Pepper, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> are not able to draw all to them&s;elves. Indeed this place about <HI>Bencalis,</HI> is in a manner at their devotion; and for ought I know, it was through a de&s;ign of being revenged on the <HI>Dutch</HI> that Capt. <HI>John&s;on</HI> lo&s;t his life. I find the <HI>Malayans</HI> in general, are implacable Enemies to the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and all &s;eems to &s;pring from an earne&s;t de&s;ire they have of a free Trade, which is re&s;trained by them, not only here, but in the Spice-I&s;lands, and in all other places where they have any Power. But 'tis freedom only mu&s;t be the means to incourage any of the&s;e remote People to Trade; e&s;pecially &s;uch of them as are in|du&s;trious, and who&s;e inclinations are bent this way; as mo&s;t of the <HI>Malayans</HI> are, and the major part of the People of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> even from the Cape of <HI>Good Hope</HI> Ea&s;tward to <HI>Japan,</HI> both Continent and I&s;lands. For tho' in many places, they are limited by the <HI>Dutch, Engli&s;h, Danes,</HI> &amp;c. and re|&s;train'd from a free Trade with other Nations, yet have they continually &s;hewn what an unea&s;ine&s;s that is to them. And how dear has this Re&s;traint co&s;t the <HI>Dutch?</HI> when yet neither can they with all their Forts and Guard-Ships &s;ecure the Trade wholly to them&s;elves, any more than the <HI>Barlaventa</HI> Fleet can &s;ecure the Trade of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> to the <HI>Spa|niards:</HI> but enough of this matter.</P>
<P>You have heard before, that Mr. <HI>Wells</HI> came with his Sloop to <HI>Bencalis,</HI> to the great joy of the two Men, that were yet alive in Captain <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s Ve&s;&s;el. The&s;e two Seamen were &s;o ju&s;t, that they put all Captain <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s Papers and Money into one Che&s;t, then lockt it and put the Key of it into another Che&s;t; and locking that, flung the Key of it into the Sea: and when Mr. <HI>Wells</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="126">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> came aboard, they offered him the Command of both Ve&s;&s;els. He &s;eemingly refu&s;ed it, &s;aying, that he was no Seamen, and could not manage either of them: yet by much importunity he accepted the Command of them, or at lea&s;t undertook the account of what was in the Sloop, engaging to give a faithful account of it to Governor <HI>Bloom.</HI></P>
<P>They were all now &s;o weakned, that they were but ju&s;t enough to &s;ail one of the Ve&s;&s;els. There|fore they &s;ent to the <HI>Shabander</HI> of <HI>Bancalis,</HI> to de&s;ire &s;ome of his Men, to help &s;ail the Sloops over to <HI>Malacca,</HI> but he refu&s;ed it. Then they offered to &s;ell one of them for a &s;mall matter, but neither would he buy. Then they offered to give him the &s;malle&s;t: To that he an&s;wered, that he did not dare to accept of her, for fear of the <HI>Dutch.</HI> Then Mr. <HI>Wells</HI> and his Crew concluded to take the Pepper and all the Stores out of the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, and burn her, and go away with the other to <HI>Malacca.</HI> This they put in execution, and pre&s;ently went away, and opening Captain <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s Che&s;t, they found 2 or 300 Dollars in Money. This with all his Writings, and what el&s;e they found of value, Mr. <HI>Wells</HI> took in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In a very &s;hort time they got over to <HI>Malacca.</HI> There they &s;tayed expecting the coming of &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, to get a Pilot to Navigate the Sloop: for neither of them would undertake to Navigate her farther.

<P>To return therefore to our own Voyage, Cap|tain <HI>Weldon</HI> having fini&s;hed his bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Malacca,</HI> we &s;ailed again, &s;teering towards <HI>Achin,</HI> where he de&s;igned to touch in his way to <HI>Fort St. George.</HI> We overtook Mr. <HI>Wells</HI> about 35 Leagues &s;hort of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> again&s;t the River <HI>Pa&s;&s;ange Jonca:</HI> and &s;hortly after

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> This Kingdom is the large&s;t and be&s;t Peopled of many &s;mall ones, that are up and down the I&s;le of <HI>Sumatra;</HI> and it makes the North We&s;t end of that I&s;land. It reaches Ea&s;tward from that N. W. point of the I&s;land, a great way along the Shore, towards the Streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI> for about 50 or 60 Leagues. But from <HI>Diamond</HI> point, which is about 40 Lagues from <HI>Achin,</HI> towads the Borders of the Kingdom, the Inhabitants, tho' belonging to <HI>Achin</HI> are in le&s;s &s;ubjection to it. Of the&s;e I can &s;ay but little; neither do I know the Bounds of this King|dom, either within Land, or along the We&s;t Coa&s;t. That We&s;t &s;ide of the Kingdom, is high and moun|tainous: as is generally the re&s;t of the We&s;t Coa&s;t of the whole I&s;land. The point al&s;o of <HI>Achin,</HI> or extremity of the I&s;land, is High Land: but <HI>Achin,</HI> it &s;elf and the Country to the Ea&s;tward, is lower, not altogether de&s;titute of &s;mall Hills, and every where of a moderate heighth, and a Champion Country, naturally very fit for cultivation.</P>
<P>There is one Hill more remarkable than ordinary, e&s;pecially to Seamen. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> call it, the <HI>Golden Mount:</HI> but whether this name is given it by the Natives, or only by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I know not. 'Tis near the N. W. end of the I&s;land; and <HI>Achin</HI> &s;tands but 5 or 6 mile from the bottom of it. 'Tis very large at the foot, and runs up &s;maller towards the head; which is rai&s;ed &s;o high, as to be &s;een at Sea 30 or 40 Leagues. This was the fir&s;t Land that we &s;aw coming in our Proe from the <HI>Nicobar I&s;lands,</HI> mentioned in my former Voyage. The re&s;t of the Land, tho' of a good heighth, was then undi&s;cerned by us, &s;o that this Mountain appeared like an I&s;land in the Sea; which was the rea&s;on why our <HI>Achin Malayans</HI> took it for <HI>Pulo Way.</HI> But that I&s;land, tho' pretty high Champion Land, was invi&s;ible, when this <HI>Golden Mount</HI> appeared &s;o plain, tho' as far di|&s;tant as that I&s;land.</P>

There they anchor at what di&s;tances they plea&s;e, according to the Mon&s;oons or Sea&s;ons of the Year. There is a &s;mall Navigable River comes out into the Sea, by which Ships tran&s;port their Commodities in &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els up to the City.

<P>The Mold of this Continent is different according to the natural po&s;ition of it.

But to be very particular in the&s;e things, e&s;pecially in all my Travels, is more than I can pretend to: tho' it may be I took as much notice of the difference of Soil as I met with it, as mo&s;t Travellers have done, having been bred in my Youth in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> at a place called <HI>Ea&s;t Cocker</HI> near <HI>Yeovil</HI> or <HI>Evil:</HI> in which Pari&s;h there is a great Variety of Soil, as I have ordinarily met with any where, <HI>viz.</HI> black, red, yellow, &s;andy, &s;tony, clay, mora&s;s or &s;wampy, &amp;c.

<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Achin</HI> has in general a deep Mold: It is very well water'd with Brooks and &s;mall Rivers, but none navigable for Ships of burthen.

This Fruit is in &s;hape much like the Pomgranate, but a great deal le&s;s. The out&s;ide rind or &s;hell is a little thicker than that of the Pomgranate, but &s;ofter, yet more brittle; and is of a dark red. The in&s;ide of the &s;hell is of a deep crim&s;on colour. Within this &s;hell the Fruit appears in 3 or 4 Cloves, about the bigne&s;s of the top of a man's thumb. The&s;e will ea&s;ily &s;eperate each from the other; they are as white as Milk, very &s;oft and juicy, inclo&s;ing a &s;mall black Stone or Kernel. The out&s;ide rind is &s;aid to be binding, and therefore many when they eat the Fruit, which is very delicious, do &s;ave the rind or &s;hell, drying it and pre&s;erving it, to give to &s;uch as have Fluxes. In a &s;mall Book, entituled, <HI>A new Voyage to the Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> there is mention made of Manga&s;tans, among the Fruits of <HI>Java:</HI> but the Author is mi&s;taken, in that he compares it to a Sloe, in &s;hape, and ta&s;te: Yet I remember there is &s;uch a &s;ort of Fruit at <HI>Achin;</HI> and believe by the de&s;cription he gives of it, it may probably be the &s;ame that he calls the Manga&s;tan, tho' nothing like the true Manga&s;tan.</P>
<P>The Pumple-no&s;e is a large Fruit like a Citron, with a very thick tender uneven rind. The in&s;ide is full of Fruit: It grows all in cloves as big as a &s;mall Barly-corn, and the&s;e are all full of juice, as an Orange or a Lemon, tho' not growing in &s;uch partitions.

<P>The chief Trades at <HI>Achin</HI> are Carpenters, Black|&s;miths, Gold&s;miths, Fi&s;hermen, and Money-chan|gers: but the Country-people live either on breed|ing Heads of Cattle, but mo&s;t for their own u&s;e, or Fowls, e&s;pecially they who live near the City, which they &s;end weekly thither to &s;ell: others plant Roots, Fruits, &amp;c. and of late they have &s;own pretty large Fields of Rice. This thrives here well enough; but they are &s;o proud, that it is again&s;t their Stomach to work: neither do they them&s;elves much trouble their heads about it, but leave it to be managed by their Slaves: and they were the Slaves brought lately by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> in the time of a Famin there, I &s;poke of before, who fir&s;t brought this &s;ort of Hu&s;bandry into &s;uch reque&s;t among the <HI>Achine&s;e.</HI> Yet neither does the Rice they have this way &s;upply one quarter of their occa&s;ions, but they have it brought to them from their Neigbouring Countries.</P>
<P>The Fi&s;hermen are the riche&s;t working People: I mean &s;uch of them as can purcha&s;e a Net; for thereby they get great profit; and this &s;ort of im|ployment is managed al&s;o by their Slaves.

The Goods that they carry thither are &s;ome &s;ort of cloathing, and liquor. They carry their Goods from the City by Sea part of the way: Then they land &s;omewhere about <HI>Pa&s;&s;ange Jonca,</HI> and get Hor&s;es to carry their Cargo to the foot of the Mountains. There they draw it up with Ropes, and if they have much goods, one &s;tays there with them, while the re&s;t march to the Mines with their load; and return again for the re&s;t. I had this relation from Captain <HI>Tiler,</HI> who lived at <HI>Achin,</HI> and &s;poke the Language of the Country very well. There was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rene|gado that u&s;ed that trade, but was always at the Mines when I was here. At his Return to <HI>Achin</HI> he con&s;tantly frequented an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Punch-hou&s;e, &s;pend|ing his Gold very freely, as I was told by the Ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e. I was told al&s;o by all that I di&s;cour|&s;ed with about the Gold, that here they dig it out of the Ground; and that &s;ometimes they find pretty large lumps.</P>
<P>It is the product of the&s;e Mines that draws &s;o many Merchants hither, for the Road is &s;eldom without 10 or 15 &s;ail of Ships of &s;everal Nations. The&s;e bring all &s;ort of vendible Commodities, as Silks, Chints, Muzlins, Callicoes, Rice, &amp;c. and as to this la&s;t, a man would admire to &s;ee what great quanities of Rice are brought hither by the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch, Danes</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;e:</HI> when any arrives, the Commanders hire each a Hou&s;e to put their goods in. The Silks, Muzlins, Callicoes, Opium, and &s;uch like rich Goods, they &s;ell to the <HI>Guzurats,</HI> who are the chief men that keep Shops here; but the Rice, which is the bulk of the Cargo, they u&s;u|ally retail. I have heard a Merchant &s;ay, he has received 60, 70, and 80<HI>l.</HI> a day for Rice, when it has been &s;carce; but when there are many &s;ellers,
<PB N="135" REF="143">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> then 40 or 50<HI>s.</HI> worth in a day is a good &s;ale: for then a <HI>Me&s;s</HI> will buy 14 or 15 Bamboes of it: whereas when Rice is &s;carce, you will not have above 3 or 4 Bamboes for a <HI>Me&s;s.</HI> A Bamboe is a &s;mall &s;eal'd mea&s;ure, containing, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, not much above half a Gallon. Thus it ri&s;es and falls as Ships come hither. Tho&s;e who &s;ell Rice keep one con&s;tantly attending to mea&s;ure it out; and the very Grandees them&s;elves never keep a &s;tock before hand, but depend on the Market, and buy ju&s;t when they have occa&s;ion. They &s;end their Slaves for what they want, and the poorer &s;ort, who have not a Slave of their own, will yet hire one to carry a <HI>Me&s;s</HI> worth of Rice for them, tho' not one hundred paces from their own homes, &s;corning to do it them&s;elves. Be&s;ides one to mea&s;ure the Rice, the Merchants hire a man to take the Money; for here is &s;ome fal&s;e Money, as Silver and Copper <HI>Me&s;s</HI> gilt over: Be&s;ides, here are &s;ome true <HI>Me&s;s</HI> much worn, and therefore not worth near their value in tale. The Merchants may al&s;o have occa&s;ion to receive 10 or 20<HI>l.</HI> at a time for other Commodities; and this too be&s;ides tho&s;e little &s;umms for Rice, he mu&s;t re|ceive by his Broker, if he will not be cheated; for 'tis work enough to examin every piece: and in receiving the value of 10<HI>l.</HI> in <HI>Me&s;s,</HI> they will ordinarily be forc'd to return half or more to be chang'd; for the Natives are for putting off bad Money, if po&s;&s;ibly they can. But if the Broker takes any bad Money, 'tis to his own lo&s;s. The&s;e &s;ort of Brokers are commonly <HI>Guzurats,</HI> and 'tis very nece&s;&s;ary for a Merchant that comes hither, e&s;pecially if he is a Stranger, to have one of them, for fear of taking bad or light Money.</P>

<P>The Laws of this Country are very &s;trict, and offenders are puni&s;hed with great &s;everity.

Small offenders are only whipt on the back, which &s;ort of puni&s;h|ment they call <HI>Chaubuck.</HI> A Thief for his fir&s;t of|fence, has his right hand chopt off at the Wri&s;t: for the &s;econd offence off goes the other; and &s;ometimes in&s;tead of one of their hands, one or both their feet are cut off; and &s;ometimes (tho' very rarely) both hands and feet. If after the lo&s;s of one or both hands or feet, they &s;till prove incor|rigible, for they are many of them &s;uch very Rogues and &s;o arch, that they will &s;teal with their Toes, then they are bani&s;h'd to <HI>Pulo Way,</HI> during their Lives: and if they get thence to the City, as &s;ome|times they do, they are commonly &s;ent back again; tho' &s;ometimes they get a Licen&s;e to &s;tay.</P>

<P>I never heard of any that &s;uffer'd Death for Theft. Criminals, who de&s;erve death, are executed divers ways, according to the nature of the offence, or the quality of the offender. One way is by Im|paling on a &s;harp Stake, which pa&s;&s;eth up right from the Fundament through the Bowels, and comes out at the Neck. The Stake is about the bigne&s;s of a mans Thigh, placed upright, one end in the ground very &s;irm; the upper &s;harp end is about 12 or 14 foot high. I &s;aw one man &s;pitted in this man|ner, and there he remain'd 2 or 3 days: but I could not learn his offence.</P>
<P>Noblemen have a more honourable death; they are allowed to fight for their lives: but the num|bers of tho&s;e with whom they are to engage, &s;oon put a period to the Combat, by the death of the Malefactor. The manner of it is thus; the per&s;on condemned is brought bound to the place of ex|cution. This is a large plain Field, &s;pacious enough to contain thou&s;ands of People. Thither the <HI>Achine&s;e,</HI> armed, as they u&s;ually go, with their Cre&s;&s;et, but then more e&s;pecially, re&s;ort in Troops, as well to be &s;pectators, as actors in the Tragedy.

When the time is come to act, he is unbound, and left at his liberty to take up his fighting Weapons. The &s;pectators being all ready, with each man his Arms in his hand, &s;tand &s;till in their places, till the Malefactor advances, He commonly &s;ets out with a &s;hriek, and daringly faces the multitude: but he is &s;oon brought to the ground, fir&s;t by Lances thrown at him, and afterwards by their Swords and Cre&s;&s;ets.

<P>This Country is governed by a Queen, under whom there are 12 <HI>Oronkeys,</HI> or great Lords. The&s;e act in their &s;everal precincts with great Power and Authority. Under the&s;e there are other inferior Officers, to keep the Peace in the &s;everal parts of the Queens Dominions. The pre&s;ent <HI>Shabander</HI> of <HI>Achin</HI> is one of the <HI>Oronkeys.</HI> He is a Man of great|er knowledge than any of the re&s;t, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be very rich. I have heard &s;ay, he had not le&s;s than 1000 Slaves, &s;ome of whom were topping Merchants, and had many Slaves under them. And even the&s;e, tho' they are Slaves to Slaves, yet have their Slaves al&s;o; neither can a &s;tranger ea&s;ily know who is a Slave and who not among them: for they are all, in a manner, Slaves to one an|other: and all in general to the Queen and <HI>Oron|keys;</HI> for their Government is very Arbitrary. Yet there is nothing of rigour u&s;ed by the Ma&s;ter to his Slave, except it be the very meane&s;t, &s;uch as do all &s;orts of &s;ervile work: but tho&s;e who can turn their hands to any thing be&s;ides Drudgery, live well enough by their indu&s;try. Nay, they are encouraged by their Ma&s;ters, who often lend them Money to begin &s;ome trade or bu&s;ine&s;s withal: Whereby the Servant lives ea&s;ie, and with great content follows what his Inclination or Capacity fits him for; and the Ma&s;ter al&s;o, who has a &s;hare in the gains, reaps the more profit, yet without trou|ble. When one of the&s;e Slaves dies, his Ma&s;ter is Heir to what he leaves; and his Children, if he has any, become his Slaves al&s;o: unle&s;s the Father out of his own clear gains has in his life time had wherewithal to purcha&s;e their Freedom. The Markets are kept by the&s;e People, and you &s;carce

The River is wider, &s;hallower, and more &s;andy at the City, than any where el&s;e near it: yet not fordable at low Water. Therefore for the better communication from one &s;ide to the other, there are Ferry-boats to carry Pa&s;&s;engers to and fro.

<P>But not long after this he being informed that the <HI>Moors</HI> Merchants re&s;iding here had carried off a great Trea&s;ure aboard their Ships, in order to return with it to <HI>Surrat,</HI> and our Company having now Wars with the Great Mogul, Captain <HI>Thwait</HI> in the Even|ing drew of all his Seamen, and &s;eized on one of the <HI>Moors</HI> Ships, where he thought the Trea&s;ure was.

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> It was 11 or 12 a Clock the next day, before we who lived a&s;hore heard of Captain <HI>Thwaits</HI> proceed|ings: but &s;eeing the <HI>Moors</HI> flock to Court, and not knowing what an&s;wer they had from the Queen, we po&s;ted off to the Ships, for fear of being im|pri&s;oned, as &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men had been while I was at <HI>Tonquin,</HI> on the like &s;core. Indeed I had at this time great cau&s;e to be afraid of a Pri&s;on, being &s;ick of a Flux, &s;o that a Pri&s;on would have gone near to have killed me: yet I think it fared not much bet|ter with me, for the Ships I fled to afforded me but little comfort. For I knew no man aboard the <HI>Do|rothy,</HI> and could expect no comfort there. So I and the re&s;t went aboard the <HI>Nellegree,</HI> where we could more rea&s;onably expect relief, than in a Ship that came from <HI>England:</HI> for the&s;e which come &s;o long a Voyage, are ju&s;t victualled for the Service, and the Seamen have every one their &s;tinted allowance, out of which they have little enough to &s;pare to Strangers.</P>
<P>But tho' there were Victuals enough aboard the <HI>Nellegree,</HI> yet &s;o weak as I then was, I had more mind to re&s;t my &s;elf than to eat: and the Ship was &s;o pe&s;tered with Goods, that I could not find a place to hang up my Hammock in. Therefore it being fair weather, I made a &s;hift to lye in the Boat that I came aboard in. My Flux was violent, and I &s;lept but little; &s;o I had the opportunity of ob&s;erving the Moon totally Eclip&s;ed, had I been in a condition to ob&s;erve any thing. As &s;oon as I per|ceiv'd the Moon to be eclip&s;ed, I gazed at it indeed, as I lay, till it was totally ob&s;cured, which was a pretty while: but I was &s;o little curious, that I re|membred not &s;o much as what day of the Month it was; and I kept no Journal of this Voyage, as I did of my other, but only kept an account of &s;eve|ral particular Remarks and Ob&s;ervations as they oc|curred to me. I lay three or four days thus in this
<PB N="148" REF="156">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> Boat, and the people of the Ship were &s;o kind as to provide me with nece&s;&s;aries: and by this time the <HI>Moors</HI> had got a Pa&s;s from the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain then in the Road, for 4 or 500 Dollars, as I was then told, and Captain <HI>Thwait</HI> delivered them their Ship again, but what terms he made with them, I know not. Thus that Fray was over, and we came a&s;hore again, recovered of the fright we had been in. In a &s;hort time al&s;o after this, the <HI>Achine&s;e</HI> all agreed to own the new Queen, and &s;o the War ended without any Blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>I was per&s;waded to wa&s;h in the River, Mornings and Evenings, for the recovery of my Health: and tho' it &s;eemed &s;trange to me before I tryed it, yet I found &s;o much comfort in the fir&s;t trial, that I con&s;tantly appyed my &s;elf to it. I went into the Ri|ver till the water was as high as my wa&s;te, and then I &s;tooped down and found the water &s;o cool and refre&s;hing to my Body, that I was always loth to go out again. Then I was &s;en&s;ible that my Bowels were very hot, for I found a great heat within me, which I found refre&s;ht by the cool water. My Food was Salt-fi&s;h broyled, and boyled Rice mixt with <HI>Tire. Tire</HI> is &s;old about the Streets there: 'tis thick &s;ower milk. It is very cooling, and the Salt-fi&s;h and Rice is binding: therefore this is thought there the proper food for the common people, when they have Fluxes. But the Richer Sort will have <HI>Sago,</HI> which is brought to <HI>Achin</HI> from other Coun|tries, and Milk of Almonds.</P>
<P>But to return to the &s;tate of <HI>Achin,</HI> before I go off from it I &s;hall add this &s;hort account of the Sea|&s;ons of year there, that their weather is much the &s;ame as in other Countries North of the Line, and their dry Sea&s;ons, Rains, and Land-floods come much at the &s;ame time, as at <HI>Tonquin</HI> and other places of North Latitude. Only as <HI>Achin</HI> lies within a few Degrees of the Line, &s;o upon the Suns cro&s;&s;ing the

I have &s;een it rain there for 2 or 3 days without intermi&s;&s;ion; and the River running but a &s;hort cour&s;e, its head not lying very far within Land, it &s;oon overflows; and a great part of the Street of the City, &s;hall on a &s;udden be all under water; at which time People row up and down the Streets in Canoas. That &s;ide of the City towards the River e&s;pecially, where the Foreign Merchants live, and which is lower ground, is fre|quently under Water in the wet Sea&s;on: a Ships Long-boat has come up to the very Gate of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory laden with Goods; which at other times is ground dry enough, at a good di&s;tance from the River, and moderately rai&s;ed above it. I did not find the heat there any thing different from other places in that Latitude; tho' I was there both in the wet and dry Sea&s;on.

<P>AS &s;oon as I was pretty well recovered, I was Shipt Mate of the Sloop that came from <HI>Ma|lacca</HI> with us, which Mr. <HI>Wells</HI> had &s;old to Captain <HI>Tyler,</HI> who lately came from <HI>Siam:</HI> and I was &s;ent aboard to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her, about the begin|ning of <HI>May,</HI> 1689. He who was de&s;igned to com|mand
<PB N="151" REF="159">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> her came to <HI>Achin</HI> Mate of the <HI>Nellegree;</HI> and we were now to go to <HI>Pegu,</HI> but before the middle of <HI>June</HI> he left the Employ, being &s;ick, and loth to go at this dead time of the year to <HI>Pegu,</HI> becau&s;e the We&s;terly Wind was &s;et in &s;trong, and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Pegu</HI> is low Land, and we were both unacquainted on the Coa&s;t. I was then made Commander, and took in Goods in order to depart for that Coa&s;t. In the mean time Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> arrived in his Ship from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel</HI> laden with Rice, and a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el belonging to Capt. <HI>Tyler</HI> came al&s;o from <HI>Merga</HI> much about the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Ship had been at <HI>Merga</HI> a con&s;iderable time, having been &s;eized on by the <HI>Siamites,</HI> and all the Men impri&s;oned, for &s;ome difference that hap|pened between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and them. Neither was a Pri&s;on then thought hard u&s;age by them, for during the Havock was made of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there, many of tho&s;e who lived at <HI>Merga</HI> were ma&s;&s;acred. Tho&s;e who were impri&s;oned, were kept there till all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who lived at the City of <HI>Siam,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the Kingdom, withdrew from thence: and then the&s;e Men had their Liberty re&s;tored al&s;o, and their Ship given them, but no Goods, nor &s;atisfacti|on for their Lo&s;&s;es, nor &s;o much as a Compa&s;s to bring with them, and but litle Provi&s;ion. Yet here they &s;afely arrived, this being a better Ship that I was gone aboard of, Captain <HI>Tyler</HI> imme|diately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">itted her up for the Sea, in order to &s;end her to <HI>Pegu.</HI></P>
<P>By this time my Ve&s;&s;el was loaden, and my Cargo was eleven thou&s;and Coco-nuts, five or &s;ix hundred weight of Sugar, and half a dozen Che&s;t of Drawers of <HI>Japan</HI> work, two were very large, de&s;igned for a Pre&s;ent to the King. Be&s;ides this, Capt. <HI>Tyler,</HI> for &s;o we u&s;ed to call him, tho' he was only a Merchant, &s;aid he intended to &s;end a good quantity of Gold thither, by which he expected to gain 60 or 70 <HI>per</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="160">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> <HI>Cent;</HI> for by report the King of <HI>Pegu</HI> had lately built a very magnificent <HI>Pagoda,</HI> and was gilding it very richly with Gold: be&s;ides he was making a large Image of Ma&s;ly Gold for the chief <HI>Pagod</HI> of this Temple. By this means Gold was ri&s;en in its value here: and <HI>Achin</HI> being a place abounding in that Metal, much of it had already been &s;ent thi|ther from hence, and more was going in other Ve&s;&s;els, belonging to the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Achin,</HI> be&s;ide what Captain <HI>Tyler</HI> de&s;igned to &s;end.</P>
<P>It was now about the middle of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> and tho' I was ready to &s;ail, yet I was ordered to &s;tay for Captain <HI>Tyler</HI>'s other Ve&s;&s;el, till &s;he had taken in her lading, which was daily &s;ent off. Her Cargo al&s;o was Coco-nuts, and &s;he had about 8 or 9000 already aboard: When I received an order from Captaln <HI>Tyler</HI> to hale aboard of her, and put all my Cargo into her; as al&s;o all my Water-ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">k, and whatever el&s;e I could &s;pare that they wanted; but withal he de&s;ired me to be &s;atisfied, and told me I &s;hould in a &s;hort time be &s;ent to Sea: but that Ship being the bigge&s;t, he thought it more conve|nient to di&s;patch her fir&s;t. I pre&s;ently did as I was ordered; and finding that I &s;hould not go this Voyage. I &s;old al&s;o my &s;mall Cargo, which con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ome Coco-nuts and about 100 Nutmegs, which had the Shells on as they grew on the Trees. I bought all that I could meet with in the Town, and paid about 3<HI>d.</HI> a piece, and expected to have had 12<HI>d.</HI> a piece for them at <HI>Pegu,</HI> where they are much e&s;teemed if the Shells be on, for el&s;e they don't value them.</P>
<P>About this time the <HI>George,</HI> a great <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship belonging to one Mr. <HI>Dalton,</HI> arrived here from the City of <HI>Siam,</HI> coming thro' the Streights of <HI>Malacca.</HI> He had been there &s;ome years trading to and fro, and had made very profitable Voyages: but the late Revolution that hapned there by the Death of the

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> King, and the unhappy fate of my Lord <HI>Falcon,</HI> cau&s;ed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to withdraw from thence. The <HI>French</HI> were all &s;ent away &s;ome Months before, being not &s;uffered to &s;tay in the Kingdom: but before this Ship came from thence, the Broyls of State were over; for the new King being &s;ettled, all Tumults which commonly ari&s;e in the&s;e Countries at the Death of the King, were appea&s;ed. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were then de&s;ired to &s;tay there, and tho&s;e who had yielded up their Places and Offices, were even in|treated to accept them again, for they owned that they had all &s;erved the Nation faithfully. But not long before the Revolution, the Governour of <HI>Fort St. George</HI> &s;ent for all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from thence particularly, and from the Service of all other <HI>Indian</HI> Princes, to come and &s;erve the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company at the Fort, or where el&s;e they &s;hould &s;end them. For that rea&s;on they all came away with Mr. <HI>Dal|ton,</HI> and he, in kindne&s;s to his Country-men, re|fu&s;ed to take in Goods or Freight, becau&s;e he would have room enough for their pa&s;&s;age, and their Hou&s;hold Goods: for here were &s;ome Families of Men, Women and Children.</P>
<P>They were a long time coming from <HI>Siam</HI> to <HI>Achin,</HI> becau&s;e they came again&s;t the Mon&s;oon; and in their pa&s;&s;age they touch'd at <HI>Malacca,</HI> and when they arrived at <HI>Achin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dalton</HI> went a&s;hore and hired an Hou&s;e, as did al&s;o mo&s;t of his Pa&s;&s;en|gers: and among the re&s;t Captain <HI>Minchin,</HI> who had formerly &s;erved the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company at <HI>Surrat,</HI> but on &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t left that place and came to <HI>Siam.</HI> There he was made Gunner of a Fort, and maintained his Wife and Family very well in that Employ, till the Revolution there, and the Companies orders came and called him from thence. He being now de&s;titute of employment, the Merchants there thought of making him Com|mander of the Ve&s;&s;el that I was in, becau&s;e Cap|tain
<PB N="154" REF="162">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> <HI>Tyler</HI> was minded to &s;ell part of her. Accord|ingly they met about it, and the Ve&s;&s;el was divided into four parts, three of which were purcha&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Dalton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Minchin,</HI> and Captain <HI>Tyler</HI> kept the 4th. The next day Capt. <HI>Minchin</HI> came off with an order to me to deliver him the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ship, and told me, that if I liked to go his Mate, I might &s;till keep a|board till they had agreed on a Voyage. I was forced to &s;ubmit, and accepted a Mates Employ under Captain <HI>Minchin.</HI> It was not long before we were ordered for <HI>Malacca</HI> to buy Goods there. We carried no Goods with us, be&s;ides 3 or 400 pound of Opium.</P>
<P>It was about the middle of <HI>September,</HI> 1689. when we &s;ailed from <HI>Achin.</HI> We were four white Men in the Ve&s;&s;el, the Captain, and Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who went Supercargo, my &s;elf and the Boat&s;wain. For common Seamen we had 7 or 8 <HI>Moors:</HI> and gene|rally in the&s;e Country Ships the White-men are all Officers. Two days after we left <HI>Achin,</HI> being becalmed under the Shore, we came to an Anchor. Not long after a Ship coming in from the Sea|ward, came to an anchor about 2 mile a-head of us. Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> knew her to be a <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Ship be|longing to <HI>Trangambar;</HI> and therefore we hoi&s;ted out our Boat, and thought to have &s;poken with her: but a &s;mall breeze &s;pringing up, they weighed their Anchors and went away; neither would they &s;peak with us, tho' we made &s;igns for them to &s;tay. We weighed al&s;o and jogg'd on after them, but they &s;ailed better than we. We met little Winds and Calms, &s;o that it was &s;even or eight days be|fore we got as far as <HI>Diamond-point,</HI> which is about forty leagues from <HI>Achin.</HI></P>
<P>Being about four leagues &s;hort of that point, Cap|tain <HI>Minchin</HI> de&s;ired me to &s;et the Land, and withal prick the Card, and &s;ee what Cour&s;e we ought to
<PB N="155" REF="163">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> keep all night; for it was now about 6 a clock, and we had a fine gale at W. S. W. our cour&s;e yet being E. S. E.</P>
<P>After I had &s;et the Land, I went into the Cab|bin to look over the Draught to &s;ee what cour&s;e we mu&s;t &s;teer after we came about the Point. Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> followed me, and when I had &s;atisfied my &s;elf, he a&s;ked me what cour&s;e we mu&s;t &s;teer? I told him E. S. E. till 12 a clock, if the gale &s;tood, and then we might hale more Southerly. He &s;eemed to be &s;tartled at it, and told me, that the Captain and he had been pricking the Card, and thought that S. E. or S. E. by S. cour&s;e would do well at 8 a clock. I &s;aid it was a good cour&s;e to run a&s;hore; he argued a long time with me, but I per&s;i&s;ted in my opinion, and when I told Captain <HI>Minchin</HI> of my opinion, he was well &s;atisfied. Pre|&s;ently after this we had a pretty &s;trong Tornado out of the S. W. which obliged us to hand our Top|&s;ail. When the &s;tre&s;s of the weather was over, we &s;et our &s;ails again, and went in to Supper, and ordered the Man at Helm not to come to the Southward of the E. S. E. We &s;tayed in the Cab|bin till about 8 a clock, and then we came out to &s;et the Watch. It was now very dark, by rea&s;on of a Thunder-Cloud that hung rumbling over the Land: yet by the fla&s;hes of lightning we plainly &s;aw the Land, right a-head of us. I was much &s;urprized, and ran into the Steeridge to look on the Compa&s;s, and found that we were &s;teering S. S. E. in&s;tead of E. S. E. I clapt the Helm a Star|board, and brought her to N. E. by E. and N. E. and we very narrowly e&s;cap'd being ca&s;t away.</P>
<P>When we fir&s;t went to Supper we were 3 leagues off Land, and then E. S. E. was a good cour&s;e, the Land lying E. S. E. parallel with our cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="164">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> But then the Man at Helm mi&s;taking his Com|pa&s;s &s;teer'd S. S. E. which runs right in upon the Shore.

So that 'twas now ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;teer Northerly to get out of the Bay; and by this time Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> was &s;atisfied with what I told him in the Evening, and was convinced of his Error. I un|dertook to direct the Man at Helm, and the Wind continuing, I kept off till ten a clock: then I &s;teer|ed E. S. E. till 12, and then haled up S. S.

<P>In the Evening we had a fine Land Breeze, with which we ran along the Shore, keeping on a wind, and &s;ounding every now and then. At la&s;t we were got among the Sholes, at the mouth of that River, and puzled to get out again. The River

They came to an Anchor about 2 or 3 a clock in the After|noon: but the Wind &s;lacken'd, and it was 8 a Clock at night before we came thither. We An|chored about a mile from them, and pre&s;ently hoy&s;ed out our Boat to go aboard: for we judged that this was the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Ship, that we &s;aw when we came fir&s;t from <HI>Achin.</HI> I went in the Boat, be|cau&s;e Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> told me, that Mr. <HI>Coppinger</HI> was Surgeon of her, the &s;ame Per&s;on who was with me in the Boat when I was &s;et a &s;hore at the <HI>Nico|bar</HI> I&s;les, but was not &s;uffered to &s;tay with me.

The&s;e Merchants were Inhabitants of <HI>Trangambar</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel.</HI> They having no Ships of their own, when the <HI>Danes</HI> fit out a Ship, on any Voyage that they are inclined to, the&s;e <HI>Moors</HI> are obliged to joyn Stock with them, and they fir&s;t make an Offer of it to them as a kindne&s;s: and the <HI>Moors</HI> being gene|rally de&s;irous to Trade, frequently accept of it al|mo&s;t on any Terms: but &s;hould they be unwilling, yet dare they not refu&s;e, for fear of di&s;obliging the <HI>Danes,</HI> who are Lords of the place. In this Ship I found Mr. <HI>Coppenger:</HI> and he was the fir&s;t that I had &s;een of all the Company that left me at the <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;lands.

<P>We &s;tood on yet neare&s;t to the <HI>Sumatra</HI> Shore, till we came in &s;ight of <HI>Pulo Arii,</HI> in Lat. 3d. 2 m. N. The&s;e are &s;everal I&s;lands lying S.

In the Channel there is 12 or 14 fathom water, but you may keep in 7 or 8 fathom on either &s;ide; and &s;ounding all the way, you may pa&s;s on without danger.</P>
<P>We had a good gale at We&s;t, which brought us in &s;ight of <HI>Pulo Par&s;alore:</HI> and &s;o we kept &s;ounding till we came within the Shoar, and then we had the Town of <HI>Malacca</HI> about 18 leagues di&s;tant from us, to the S.

The Tide runs pretty &s;trong here; the Flood &s;ets to the Ea&s;tward, and the Ebb to the We&s;t: and therefore when there is little wind, and Ships cannot &s;tem the Tide, they commonly anchor. But we being in with the <HI>Malacca</HI> Shoar, had a we&s;terly Wind, which brought us before <HI>Malacca</HI> Town, about the middle of <HI>October;</HI> and here I fir&s;t heard that King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> were crowned King and Queen of <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Dane</HI> that left us at <HI>Pulo Verero</HI> was not yet arrived: for, as we after|wards under&s;tood, they could not find the way through the Sands, but were forced to keep along without them, and fetch a great Compa&s;s about, which retarded their Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="168">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> <HI>Malacca</HI> is a pretty large Town, of about 2 or 300 Families of <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> many of which are a mixt breed between tho&s;e Nations. There are al&s;o many of the Native <HI>Malayans</HI> inhabiting in &s;mall Cottages on the Skirts of the Town. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Hou&s;es are built with Stone, and the Streets are wide and &s;traight, but not paved. At the North We&s;t of the Town there is a Wall and Gate to pa&s;s in and out: and a &s;mall Fort always guarded with Soldiers. The Town &s;tands on a level low ground, clo&s;e by the Sea. The Land on the back|&s;ide of the Town &s;eems to be mora&s;&s;y, and on the We&s;t &s;ide, without the Wall, there are Gardens of Fruits and Herbs, and &s;ome fair <HI>Dutch</HI> Hou&s;es: but that Quarter is chiefly the habitation of the <HI>Malay|ans.</HI> On the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Town, there is a &s;mall River which at a Spring Tide will admit &s;mall Barks to enter. About 100 paces from the Sea there is a Draw-bridge, which leads from the mid&s;t of the Town to a &s;trong Fort, built on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the River.</P>
<P>This is the chief Fort, and is built on a low level ground, clo&s;e by the Sea, at the Foot of a little &s;teep Hill. Its form is &s;emicircular, according to the natural po&s;ition of the adjacent Hill. It fronts chiefly to the Sea, and having its foundation on firm Rocks, the Walls are carried up to a good height, and of a con&s;iderable thickne&s;s. The lower part of it is wa&s;hed by the Sea every Tide. On the back of the Hill, the Land being naturally low, there is a very large Moat cut from the Sea to the River, which makes the whole an I&s;land; and that back part is &s;tockadoed round with great Trees, &s;et up an end: &s;o that there is no entring when once the Draw-bridge is haled up. On the Hill, within this Fort &s;tands a &s;mall Church big enough to receive all the Towns-people, who come hither on <HI>Sundays</HI> to hear Divine Service: and on the Main,

<P>The fir&s;t <HI>Europeans</HI> who &s;etled here were the <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> They al&s;o built the great Fort: but whether they moted round the Hill, and made an I&s;land of that &s;pot of ground, I know not, nor what charges have been be&s;towed on it &s;ince to make it defenceable; nor what other alterations have been made; but the whole Building &s;eems to be pretty ancient, and that part of it which fronts to the Sea, was in all probability, built by the <HI>Portu|gne&s;e;</HI> for there are &s;till the marks of the Conque|rours &s;hot in the Walls. It is a place &s;o naturally &s;trong, that I even wonder how they could be beaten out: but when I con&s;ider what other places they then lo&s;t, and their mi&s;managements, I am the le&s;s &s;urprized at it. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> were the fir&s;t di&s;coverers by Sea of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and had thereby the Advantage of Trade with the&s;e rich <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> People, as al&s;o an opportunity, thro' their weakne&s;s, to &s;ettle them&s;elves where they plea&s;ed. Therefore they made Settlements and Fortsamong them in divers places of <HI>India,</HI> as here for one: and per&s;uming upon the &s;trength of their Forts, they in&s;ulted over the Natives; and being grown rich with Trade, they fell to all manner of loo&s;ene&s;s and debauchery; the u&s;ual concomitant of Wealth, and as commonly the fore-runner of Ruin. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> at this place, by report, made u&s;e of the Native Women at their plea&s;ure, whether Virgins or Married Women; &s;uch as they liked they took without control: and it is probable, they as little re&s;trained their lu&s;t in other places; for the Breed of them is &s;cattered all over <HI>India;</HI> neither are there any People of more different Complexions than of that Race, even from the coal-black to a light tawney.

Some of them keep Tea-hou&s;es, were for a Stiver a man has near a pint of Tea, and a little Porrenger of Sugar-candy, or other Sweet-meats, if he plea&s;es.

<P>This Town is plentiful &s;tored with Fi&s;h al&s;o. When the Fi&s;hermen come in, they all re&s;ort to a place built purpo&s;ely for the &s;ale of them.

<P>As for other Provi&s;ions, their Rice is brought to them from abroad.

They have al&s;o a few Cattle, Bullocks, and Hor&s;es, &amp;c. having but little Pa&s;turage, but good &s;tore of tame Fowl, Ducks, and Poultry. The principal per&s;on in the Town is the <HI>Shahander,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> man, next in power to the Governour, who lives in the Fort, and meddles not with Trade, which is the <HI>Shahander</HI>'s Province, who &s;eems to be chiefly concerned about the Cu&s;toms of Goods.</P>
<P>This Town has no great Trade, by what I could &s;ee, but it &s;eems to be de&s;ignedly built to command the pa&s;&s;age of Shipping, going this way to the more <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Nations. Not but that Ships may pa&s;s far enough out of reach of their Cannon; but Guard&s;hips belonging to the Town, and lying in the Road, may hinder others from pa&s;&s;ing. How the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> managed their Affairs I know not;
<PB N="164" REF="172">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> but the <HI>Dutch</HI> commonly keep a Guard&s;hip here; and I have been told they require a certain Duty of all Ve&s;&s;els that pa&s;s this way, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> only excepted: for all Ships touch at this place, e&s;pe|cially for Wood, Water, and Refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>Two days after our arrival here, the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Ship came al&s;o to an Anchor; but reporting that they were bound to <HI>Jihore,</HI> to lade Pepper, the <HI>Dutch</HI> told them it was but in vain for them to &s;eek a Trade there; for that the King of <HI>Jihore</HI> had agreed with the <HI>Dutch</HI> to Trade only with them; and that to &s;ecure that Trade, they had a Guard&s;hip lying there. I had this account from the Surgeon, Mr. <HI>Coppinger,</HI> who &s;eemed a little concerned at it: becau&s;e when he told me this, he could not tell whether they &s;hould proceed thither or no; but they did go thither, and &s;ound all this a &s;ham, and Traded there to their own and the Natives &s;atis|faction, as he told me the next time I met him. This of <HI>Jihore</HI> being but a &s;mall Kingdom on the &s;ame <HI>Malacca</HI> Coa&s;t, 'tis not of &s;trength &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t the power of the <HI>Dutch:</HI> neither could it benefit the <HI>Dutch</HI> to take it, &s;hould they attempt it; for the people would probably for&s;ake it, and it would be too great a charge for the <HI>Dutch</HI> to &s;ettle it them&s;elves. And therefore they only endeavour to ingro&s;s the Pepper Trade; and it is probable enough that the <HI>Dutch</HI> might &s;ometimes keep a Guard&s;hip there, as they do at other places, particu|larly at <HI>Queda, Pulo Dinding,</HI> &amp;c. For where there is any Trade to be had, yet not &s;ufficient to maintain a Factory; for where there may not be a convenient place to build a Fort, &s;o as to &s;ecure the whole Trade to them&s;elves, they &s;end their Guard&s;hips, which lying at the mouth of the Rivers, deter Strangers from coming thither, and keep the petty Princes in awe of them. They commonly make a

This probably cau&s;es &s;o many petty Robberies and Piracies as are commited by the <HI>Malayans</HI> on this Coa&s;t. The <HI>Malayans,</HI> who inhabit on both &s;ides the Streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI> are in general a bold People, and yet I do not find any of them addicted to Robbery, but only the pilfering poorer &s;ort, and even the&s;e &s;everely puni&s;hed among the Trading <HI>Malayans,</HI> who love Trade and Pro|perty. But being thus provoked by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and hindred of a free Trade by their Guard-&s;hips, it is probable, they therefore commit Piracies them|&s;elves, or connive at and incourage tho&s;e who do. So that the Pirates who lurk on this Coa&s;t, &s;eem to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o it as much to revenge them&s;elves on the <HI>Dutch,</HI> for re&s;training their Trade, as to gain this way what they cannot obtain in way of Traffick.</P>
<P>But to return to our concerns here. I have &s;aid already, that we had only 3 or 400<HI>l.</HI> of <HI>Opium</HI> in Goods, the re&s;t was in Money to the value of 2000 Dollars in the whole: but we did not pre|tend, that we came hither purpo&s;ely to trade, but that finding our Ve&s;&s;el unfit for the Sea, we put in here to mend and repair her. Leave was granted us for this; and I prepared to hale our Ve&s;&s;el a&s;hore, at the We&s;t end of the Town, not far from the &s;mall Fort. It is there &s;oft Oazy ground, near a mile off &s;hore, and it deepens very lei&s;urely, being &s;hole water ju&s;t by the &s;hore; and when the Tide goes out, it leaves the Oaz dry a quarter of a mile from the &s;hore: but a mile from &s;hore, you have clean Sand, and about 4 fathom at low Water. Our Ve&s;&s;el floated in clo&s;e to the Fort, and lay not 20 yards from it, and at low water it &s;unk down into the mud: that we could not fit the after-part, as I would

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> have done. <HI>Opium,</HI> which is much u&s;ed by the <HI>Malayans</HI> in mo&s;t places, was a great Commodity here at this time: but it is prohibited Goods, and therefore tho' many a&s;ked for it, we were &s;hy of having it too openly known that we had any. But in &s;hort, Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> found a Cu&s;tomer, and they found means to get it a&s;hore, while the Soldiers of the Fort were at dinner. The Cu&s;tomer was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man; and the price he was to pay for it was as much as he was worth: and finding it to be nought, he would have been off his Bargain; and when Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> would not relea&s;e him, he ab&s;conded. But Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> having an Intere&s;t in the <HI>Shabander,</HI> he compell'd the Man's Wife to pay for the <HI>Opium,</HI> under the Name of Gold; for &s;o Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> call'd it. The <HI>Shabander</HI> chid Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> for &s;mugling with an inferiour, when he might have done it better with him: but &s;tood his Friend in compelling the Woman, tho' unju&s;tly, to pay for the <HI>Opium.</HI> I &s;aw this <HI>Dutch</HI>-man on board his own Ve&s;&s;el, when he had bought the <HI>Opium,</HI> and he was very pen&s;ive and &s;ad. He had a pretty fine Hou&s;e without the Gates, and a Gar|den which maintained his Family with Pot-Herbs, Sallading, and Fruits, be&s;ides &s;ome for the Mar|ket. This was managed by his Wife, and he him&s;elf had two Sloops; and either imployed them in Trading among the <HI>Malayans</HI> for Pepper, carrying them &s;uch Commodities as they wanted, e&s;pecially <HI>Opium,</HI> or by hiring him&s;elf and Sloop to the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, to go whither they would &s;end him. It was not long &s;ince he had been at the Spice I&s;lands with Rice, which he &s;old at a profitable rate: but he told me he was not &s;uffered to bring any Spice from thence, except eight or ten pound for his own &s;pending: nei|ther was there &s;o much profit that way for him,

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> as by trading at home among the <HI>Malayans,</HI> either on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malacca</HI> or <HI>Sumatra.</HI> For tho' he and other free Men are not &s;uffered to trade for them|&s;elves to any places where the Company have Facto|ries, or Guard&s;hips, yet they could find Trade enough nearer home, and by this Trade the Freemen of <HI>Malacca</HI> pick up a good livelihood. It was on this Home Trade that he was now bound, and the <HI>Opium</HI> had been very beneficial to him, had it been good: but he went away and ordered his Wife not to pay for it, but left Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> to take it again; and upon the <HI>Shabander</HI>'s compelling her to take it and pay for it, &s;he complained they were utterly undone, for the <HI>Opium,</HI> when it came to be examined was really very bad, and worth little or nothing.</P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> bought Irons Bars, Arack, Canes, and Rattans, wherewith we load our Ve&s;|&s;el, which was now &s;et afloat again. The <HI>Dutch</HI> brought mo&s;t of our Goods aboard, and were more kind then I expected, for they had not u&s;ed to Trade with us, and I believe the news of our Revolution in <HI>England</HI> had &s;weetned them; for they often drank the Konings Health with us very hear|tily.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE departed from <HI>Malacca</HI> towards <HI>Achin</HI> about the middle of <HI>November</HI> 1689. Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> being weary of Captain <HI>Minchin</HI>'s Company, had bought a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el of 7 or 8 Tuns, and laded her al&s;o with the &s;ame kind of Goods. This he commanded him&s;elf, having a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Pilot, and 3 or 4 Mariners under him, and we &s;et out both Ships in Company together. We had now in Captain <HI>Minchin</HI>'s Ship but 2 white Men, the Cap|tain and I, the Boat&s;wain being gone with Mr.
<PB N="170" REF="178">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> <HI>Coventry;</HI> but we took in as a Pa&s;&s;enger one Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who having lately married a <HI>Dutch</HI> Woman at <HI>Malacca,</HI> came aboard us with her, to go as Pa&s;&s;engers to <HI>Achin</HI> with us.</P>
<P>We had a Land Wind in the morning and about 11 a clock had the Wind at N. W. a pretty &s;trong gale: and at 12 our Fore-yard broke in the middle. We made &s;igns to Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> to bear down to us; who weighing before was a mile to Windward of us; but he kept on, fearing to return, as having bought his Ship there by &s;tealth: and we therefore returned alone into <HI>Malacca</HI> Road. As &s;oon as we anchored, Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> was &s;ent a&s;hore to buy a new Yard; I gave him the length and bigne&s;s. It was Evening before he came aboard again, and he brought aboard an old Yard much too big and too long for us. This piece I &s;hortned and &s;haped to my mind, and by 12 a clock at Night, had it fixed and &s;lung, rigg'd and the Sail bent to it.</P>
<P>Then we weighed again having a &s;mall land Wind; but the Tide of flood was again&s;t us, and drove us to the Ea&s;tward. When the Ebb came we jogg'd on, and got about three leagues, anchoring when the flood came, becau&s;e the Winds were again&s;t us. Thus we continued plying with the Ebb, and ancho|ring every flood, till we came to <HI>Pulo Par&s;elore,</HI> where the Captain told me he would not go out the &s;ame way we came in, as I would have per&s;uaded him, but kept the <HI>Malacca</HI> Shore aboard, and pa&s;t within the Sholes. But in a few Hours after we ran upon a Shole, driven on it by the Tide of Flood, which here &s;et to the Ea&s;tward, tho' by our reckoning it &s;hould have been half Ebb, and the flood &s;hould have &s;et We&s;tward, as we had it all the re&s;t of the way from <HI>Malacca:</HI> but the Sholes probably cau&s;ed &s;ome whirling about of the Tide. However, the Sand we were &s;tuck upon was not above 100 yards in circumference, and the flood being ri&s;ing we
<PB N="171" REF="179">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> waited the time of high Water, and then drove over it, having &s;ent our Boat to di&s;cover how the Sholes lay, while our Ship was a-ground: Mr. <HI>Ri|chards</HI> all the while being in great fear, le&s;t the <HI>Malayans</HI> &s;hould come off in their Boats and attack the Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>We were now afloat again, and &s;oon got without all the Sholes: yet we did not &s;tand over towards <HI>Sumatra,</HI> but coa&s;ted along neare&s;t the <HI>Malacca</HI> &s;hore, it being now mo&s;t proper for us &s;o to do yet; for having the Winds we&s;terly, we could not have beat under the other &s;hore. 2 or 3 days after this we had &s;ight of &s;ome I&s;lands called <HI>Pulo Sambilong,</HI> which in the <HI>Malayan</HI> Language &s;ignifies nine I&s;lands, there being &s;o many of them, lying &s;cattering at unequal di&s;tances from each other. It was near one of the&s;e I&s;lands, that Captain <HI>Minchin</HI> in a former Voyage was like to loo&s;e his hand by a prick with a Cat-fi&s;hes Fin, as I have &s;aid in my former Vol. p. 149. und tho' his hand was cured, yet he has lo&s;t the u&s;e of it ever &s;ince; and is never likely to regain it more.</P>
<P>We &s;tood in pretty near the &s;hore, in hopes to gain a fre&s;h Land Wind. About 10 a Clock the Land Wind came off, a gentle breez, and we coa&s;t|ed along the &s;hore. But a &s;mall Tornado coming off from the &s;hore about midnight, we broke our Mizen Yard, and being near a <HI>Dutch</HI> I&s;land called <HI>Pulo Dinding,</HI> we made in for it, and anchored there the Night en&s;uing, and found there a <HI>Dutch</HI> Sloop, mann'd with about 30 Soldiers at an anchor.</P>
<P>This is a &s;mall I&s;land lying &s;o nigh the Main, that Ships pa&s;&s;ing by cannot know it to be an I&s;land. It is pretty high Land and well watered with Brooks. The Mould is blacki&s;h, deep and fat in the lower Ground: but the Hills are &s;omewhat Rocky yet in general very Wood. The Trees are of divers &s;orts, many of which are good Timber, and large enough for any u&s;e. Here are al&s;o &s;ome good for Ma&s;ts and Yards; they being naturally
<PB N="172" REF="180">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> light, yet tough and &s;erviceable. There is good riding on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, between the I&s;land and the Main. You may come in with the Sea Breeze, and go out with a Land Wind, there is Water enough, and a &s;ecure Harbour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch,</HI> who are the only Inhabitants, have a Fort on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, clo&s;e by the Sea, in a bend|ing of the I&s;land, which makes a &s;mall Cove for Ships to anchor in. The Fort is built 4 &s;quare, without Flankers or Ba&s;tions, like a Hou&s;e: every Square is about 10 or 12 yards. The Walls are of a good thickne&s;s, made of &s;tone, and carried up to a good heighth, of about 30 foot, and covered over head like a dwelling Hou&s;e. There may be about 12 or 14 Guns in it, &s;ome looking out at every Square. The&s;e Guns are mounted on a &s;trong Platform, made within the Walls, about 16 Foot high; and there are &s;teps on the out &s;ide to a&s;cend to the Door that opens to the Platform, there be|ing no other way into the Fort. Here is a Go|vernour and about 20 or 30 Soldiers, who all lodge in the Fort. The Soldiers have their lodging in the Platform among the Guns, but the Go|vernour has a fair Chamber above it, where h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> lies with &s;ome of the Officers. About a hundred yards from the Fort on the Bay by the Sea, there is a low timbered Hou&s;e, where the Governour abides all the day time. In this Hou&s;e there were two or three Rooms for their u&s;e, but the chiefe&s;t was the Governours Dining Room. This fronted to the Sea, and the end of it looked towards the Fort. There were two large Windows of about 7 or 8 Foot Square; the lower part of them about 2 or 3 foot from the Ground. The&s;e Windows were wont to be left open all the day, to let in the re|fre&s;hing Breeze; but in the night, when the Go|vernour withdrew to the Fort, they were clo&s;ed with &s;trong &s;hutters, and the Doors made fa&s;t til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> the next day. The Continent of <HI>Malacca</HI> op|po&s;ite to the I&s;land, is pretty low champion Land, cloathed with lofty Woods; and right again&s;t the Bay where the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fort &s;tands, there is a naviga|ble River for &s;mall Craft.</P>
<P>The product of the Country thereabouts, be&s;ides Rice and other Eatables, is <HI>Tutaneg,</HI> a &s;ort of <HI>Tin;</HI> I think cour&s;er than ours. The Natives are <HI>Ma|layans,</HI> who, as I have always ob&s;erved, are bold and treacherous: yet the Trading People are affa|ble and courteous to Merchants.</P>
<P>The&s;e are in all re&s;pects, as to their Religion, Cu&s;tom, and manner of Living, like other <HI>Ma|layans.</HI> Whether they are governed by a King or Raja, or what other manner of Government they live under, I know not. They have Canoas and Boats of their own, and with the&s;e they fi&s;h and traffick among them&s;elves: but the Tin Trade is that which has formerly drawn Merchant Strangers thither. But tho' the Country might probably yield great quanities of this Metal, and the Natives are not only inclinable, but very de&s;irous to trade with Strangers, yet are they now re&s;trained by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who have monopoliz'd that Trade to them|&s;elves. It was probably for the lucre of this Trade that the <HI>Dutch</HI> built the Fort on the I&s;land; but this not wholly an&s;wering their ends, by rea&s;on of the di&s;tance between it and the Rivers mouth, which is about 4 or 5 miles, they have al&s;o a Guard&s;hip commonly lying here, and a Sloop with 20 or 30 armed men, to hinder other Nations from this Trade. For this <HI>Tutaneg</HI> or Tin is a valuable Com|modity in the Bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> and here purcha&s;ed rea|&s;onably, by giving other Commoditiesin exchange: neither is this Commodity peculiarly found here|abouts, but farther Northerly al&s;o on the Coa&s;t; and particularly in the Kingdom of <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">da</HI> there is much of it: The <HI>Dutch</HI> al&s;o commonly keep a

<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> Guard&s;hip, and have made &s;ome fruitle&s;s e&s;&s;ays to bring that Prince and his Subjects to trade only with them; but here over again&s;t <HI>P. Dinding,</HI> no Strangers dare approach to trade; neither may any Ship come in hither but with con&s;ent of the <HI>Dutch.</HI> Therefore as &s;oon as we came to an Anchor at the Ea&s;t end of the I&s;land, we &s;ent our Boat a &s;hore to the Governour, to de&s;ire leave to wood, water, and cut a new Mizin yard. He granted our re|que&s;t, and the Boat returned again aboard, and brought word al&s;o that Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> touch'd here to water, and went out that morning. The next morning betimes Captain <HI>Minchin</HI> &s;ent me a&s;hore to cut a Yard. I applyed my &s;elf to the Gover|nour, and de&s;ired one of his Soldiers might go with me, and &s;hew me the be&s;t Timber for that u&s;e; but he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, &s;aying, that his Soldiers were all bu&s;ie at pre&s;ent, but that I might go and cut any Tree that I lik'd. So I went into the Woods, where I &s;aw abundance of very fine &s;trait Trees, and cut down &s;uch a one as I thought fit for my turn: and cutting it of a ju&s;t length, and &s;tripping off the Bark, I left it ready to be fetcht away, and return'd to the Fort, where I dined with the Governour. Pre|&s;ently after dinner, our Captain, with Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> and his Wife came a&s;hore, and I went aboard. The Governour met them at Landing, and conduct|ed them into the Dining Room I &s;poke of, where they treated the Govenour with Punch, made of Brandy, Sugar, and Lime-juice, which they brought with them from aboard: for here is nothing, not &s;o much as the Governours drink, but what is brought from <HI>Malacca:</HI> no Herbs or Fruit growing here: but all is either fetch from <HI>Malacca,</HI> or is brought by the <HI>Malayans</HI> from the Main. It is not through any &s;terility in the Soyl, for that is very fat, and fruitful: neither is it through lazine&s;s o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Dutch,</HI> for that is a vice they are net guilty of
<PB N="175" REF="183">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> but it is from a continual fear of the <HI>Malayans,</HI> with whom tho' they have a Commerce, yet dare they not tru&s;t them &s;o far, as to be ranging about the I&s;land in any work of Husbandry, or indeed to go far from the Fort, for there only they are &s;afe. But to return to the Governour, he, to retalliate the Captains and Mr. <HI>Richard</HI>'s kindne&s;s, &s;ent a Boat a fi&s;hing, to get &s;ome better entertain|ment for his Gue&s;ts, than the Fort yielded at pre&s;ent. About 4 or 5 a Clock the Boat returned with a good Di&s;h of Fi&s;h. The&s;e were immediately dre&s;t for Supper, and the Boat was &s;ent out again to get more, for Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> and his Lady to carry aboard with them. In the mean time the Food was brought into the Dining-Room, and placed on the Table. The Di&s;hes and Plates were of Silver, and there was a Silver Punch-Bowl full of Liquor. The Govenour, his Gue&s;ts, and &s;ome of his Officers were &s;eated, but ju&s;t as they began to fall to, one of the Soldiers cried out, <HI>Malayans,</HI> and &s;poil'd the Entertainment; for immediately the Go|vernour without &s;peaking one word, leapt out of one of the Windows, to get as &s;oon as he could to the Fort. His Officers followed, and all the Servants that attended were &s;oon in motion. Every one of them took the neare&s;t way, &s;ome out of the Win|dows, others out of the Doors, leaving the 3 Gue&s;ts by them&s;elves, who &s;oon followed with all the ha&s;te they could make, without knowing the meaning of this &s;udden con&s;ternation of the Governour and his People. But by that time the Captain and Mr. <HI>Ri|chards</HI> and his Wife were got to the Fort, the Go|vernour, who was arrived before, &s;tood at the door to receive them. As &s;oon as they were entred the Fort, the Door was &s;hut, all the Soldiers and Ser|vants being within already: nor was any man &s;uf|fered to fetch away the Victuals, or any of the Plate: but they fired &s;everal Guns to give notice
<PB N="176" REF="184">
<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> to the <HI>Malayans</HI> that they were ready for them; but none of them came on. For this Uproar was occa&s;ioned by a <HI>Malayan</HI> Canoa full of armed Men that lay &s;kulking under the I&s;land, clo&s;e by the Shore: and when the <HI>Dutch</HI> Boat went out the &s;e|cond time to fi&s;h, the <HI>Malayans</HI> &s;et on them &s;ud|denly, and unexpected, with their Cre&s;&s;ets and Lances, and killing one or two, the re&s;t leapt over|board, and got away, for they were clo&s;e by the Shore; and they having no Arms were not able to have made any re&s;i&s;tance. It was about a mile from the Fort: and being landed, every one of them made what ha&s;te he could to the Fort, and the fir&s;t that arrived was he who cried in that man|ner, and frighted the Governour from Supper. Our Boat was at this time a&s;hore for water, and was filling it in a &s;mall Brook by the Banquetting|hou&s;e. I know not whether our Boats Crew took notice of the Alarm, but the <HI>Dutch</HI> call'd to them; and bid them make ha&s;te aboard, which they did; and this made us keep good watch all night, having all our Guns loaden and primed for &s;ervice. But it rained &s;o hard all the night, that I did not much fear being attack'd by any <HI>Malayans;</HI> being inform|ed by one of our Sea-men, whom we took in at <HI>Malacca,</HI> that the <HI>Malayans</HI> &s;eldom or never make any attack when it rains. It is what I had before ob&s;erved of other <HI>Indians,</HI> both <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t:</HI> and tho' then they might make their Attacks with the greate&s;t advantage on Men armed with Hand-guns, yet I never knew it practi&s;ed; at which I have wondered; for it is then we mo&s;t fear them, and they might then be mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, becau&s;e their Arms, which are u&s;ually Lances and Cre&s;&s;ets, which the&s;e <HI>Malayans</HI> had, could not be damaged by the Rain, as our Guns would be. But they cannot en|dure to be in the Rain: and it was in the Evening before the Rain fell, that they a&s;&s;aulted the
<PB N="177" REF="185">
<MILESTONE N="1689" UNIT="year"> <HI>Dutch</HI> Boat. The next Morning the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sloop weighed, and went to look after the <HI>Malayans;</HI> but having &s;ailed about the I&s;land, and &s;eeing no Ene|mies, they anchored again. I al&s;o &s;ent Men a&s;hore in our Boat to bring off the Mizen-yard that I had cut the Day before: But it was &s;o heavy a kind of Timber, that they could not bring it out of the Woods. Captain <HI>Minchin</HI> was &s;till a&s;hore, and he being acquainted with it, de&s;ired the Governor to &s;end a Soldier, to &s;hew our Men what Trees were be&s;t for our u&s;e: Which he did, and they pre&s;ently cut a &s;mall Tree, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">about the bigne&s;s and length of that which I cut, and brought it aboard. I imme|diately went to work, and having fitted it for u&s;e, bent my Sail, and hoi&s;ed it up in its place. In the Evening Captain <HI>Minchin</HI> and Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> and his Wife came aboard, having &s;taid one Night at the Fort; and told me all that hapned to them a|&s;hore.</P>
<P>We now waited only for a Land Wind to carry us out. The former part of the Night we had much Rain, with Thunder and Lightning, but no Wind. At one a Clock we had a &s;mall Land Wind, and got up our Anchors. We got out before Day clear of the I&s;land, and we &s;teered along &s;hore to the North|ward, intending to keep this &s;hore aboard for 20 or 30 Leagues farther, if the Winds did not favour us; for the Sea Winds were now at N. W. This Day we kept near the &s;hore, and the Night en&s;uing; but the next Day the Wind coming at N. and N. N. E. we &s;tood over for <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and the next Evening we pa&s;t by <HI>Diamond</HI> Point: And the Wind coming at E. N.

<P>Here we found Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who had got hither 2 or 3 Days before us. Captain <HI>Minchin</HI> went a&s;hore with his Pa&s;&s;engers, and was di&s;charged of his Com|mand. I kept aboard till all the Goods were unla|den, and then lay a&s;hore, and was very &s;ick for a

<MILESTONE N="1690" UNIT="year"> Fortnight of a kind of Fever. But after <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> I was &s;ent aboard again, by order of Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who had then bought out Mr. <HI>Dalton</HI>'s and Capt. <HI>Ti|ler</HI>'s &s;hares, to take the Charge of the Ve&s;&s;el, which he had then laded with Pepper, Cubebs (which I think grow &s;omewhere in <HI>Sumatra</HI>) and <HI>Tutanegg,</HI> which he bought of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that came from <HI>Queda</HI> to <HI>Achin;</HI> and with the&s;e he had al&s;o &s;ome of our <HI>Malacca</HI> Cargo, which we kept on board, <HI>viz.</HI> Rattans and Walking Canes. With this Cargo we were bound for <HI>Fort St. George.</HI> We took in al&s;o 2 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pa&s;&s;engers, who had e&s;caped out of Pri&s;on in the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Country. The one belong'd to the <HI>Defence,</HI> Capt. <HI>Heath</HI>'s Ship, which I came home to <HI>England</HI> in afterwards; he was Pur&s;er of it: the other was a Mid&s;hipman in the <HI>Prince&s;s Ann,</HI> which return'd to <HI>England</HI> at the &s;ame Time.

The old <HI>Anabob,</HI> or Governor of the Province, be|ing remov'd, and a new one coming thither, he re|lea&s;ed the&s;e Men, and gave them leave to go to the Sea &s;ide, where finding a <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hip bound to <HI>Bata|via,</HI> the&s;e 2, and one more, went aboard her, the re&s;t getting other Pa&s;&s;age: But &s;he meeting with that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship coming from <HI>Queda,</HI> which brought the <HI>Tutanegg</HI> I but now mentioned to <HI>Achin,</HI> they left the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, and went to <HI>Achin</HI> with the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el; and tho&s;e 2 were now for going with us to <HI>Fort St. George.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas about New-years day, 1690. that we &s;et out from <HI>Achin</HI> again: We &s;teered away toward the <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;lands, and came in &s;ight of that, which I had been formerly &s;et a&s;hore upon. But leaving

<MILESTONE N="1690" UNIT="year"> it on our Star-board, we &s;tood more Northerly up into the Bay; for by Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> I had learnt there were Northerly and North Ea&s;terly winds in the Bay at this time of Year. We &s;tood over there|fore as high as <HI>Pallacat;</HI> and having then a fair North Ea&s;t Wind, we run along the Coa&s;t till we came before <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> which was about the middle of <HI>January.</HI></P>
<P>I was much plea&s;ed with the beautiful pro&s;pect this place makes off at Sea. For it &s;tands in a plain Sandy &s;pot of Ground, clo&s;e by the &s;hore, the Sea &s;ometimes wa&s;hing its Walls, which are of Stone and high, with Half Moons and Flankers, and a great many Guns mounted on the Battlements: &s;o that what with the Walls and fine Buildings within the Fort, the large Town of <HI>Maderas</HI> without it, the Pyramids of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tombs, Hou&s;es, and Gardens adjacent, and the variety of fine Trees &s;catter'd up and down, it makes as agreeable a Landskip as I have any where &s;een.</P>
<P>But 'tis not my de&s;ign to enter into a De&s;cription of a place &s;o well known to my Country-Men as this is. It may &s;uffice to have mentioned it; and that after &s;ome Months &s;tay here, and meeting with Mr. <HI>Moody</HI> and <HI>Jeoly</HI> the Painted Prince, I prepared to go for <HI>Sumatra</HI> again; to <HI>Bencouli,</HI> as I have &s;aid in my former Vol. p. 512.

<P><HI>Bencouli</HI> lies on the We&s;t Coa&s;t of the I&s;land of <HI>Su|matra,</HI> in about 4 d. S. Lat. It is a place noted enough at Sea; by rea&s;on of a high &s;lender Hill in the Country. It has a &s;mall I&s;land before it within which Ships ride. The point of <HI>Stillabar</HI> lies 2 or 3
<PB N="180" REF="188">
<MILESTONE N="1690" UNIT="year"> Leagues to the Southward of it, and runs out farther than any part of the Shore, making a &s;mall Bay within it. Be&s;ides the&s;e marks, when you come within 2 or 3 Leagues of the Shore, you'll &s;ee the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fort fronting to the Sea, which makes a fine &s;how: On the N. W. of the Fort is a &s;mall River, at the Mouth of which is a large Store-hou&s;e to put Pepper in. About a quarter of a Mile from the Sea &s;tands a &s;mall <HI>Indian</HI> Village, clo&s;e by the River; on the &s;ame &s;ide that the Fort is on, and but a &s;mall di&s;tance from it. The Hou&s;es are &s;mall and low, all built on Po&s;ts, after the <HI>Malayan</HI> manner, as at <HI>Mindanao</HI> and <HI>Achin;</HI> for 'tis a Swamp that the Town &s;tands on: But the <HI>Malayans</HI> u&s;ually choo&s;e to build in &s;uch low places near Rivers, for the con|venience of wa&s;hing them&s;elves, which they greatly delight in; as 'tis indeed a part of their Religion as <HI>Mahometans:</HI> And if they can, they will have their Hou&s;es &s;tand on Po&s;ts over the River.</P>
<P>The Weather here is none of the plea&s;ante&s;t. There are great Rains chiefly in <HI>September, October,</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> and pretty great Heats. But when the Wind blew hard, which 'twould often do, the Air would be chill: And the Sea-breezes in fair Wea|ther were generally pretty fre&s;h and comfortable. The Land Winds coming over Swamps, u&s;ually brought a Stink with them. 'Tis in general an un|healthy Place; and the Soldiers of the Fort were &s;ickly and died very fa&s;t. On the South &s;ide of the Fort is a fair champion Savannah, of a Mile or Two Square, called <HI>Greenhil.</HI> It produces long thick Gra&s;s: The N. W. part of it fronts the Sea, and the S. E. is bounded with lofty Woods.</P>
<P>The Soil of this Country is very different, ac|cording to its different po&s;ition: For within Land 'tis hilly, yet tho&s;e Hills are clothed with Trees; which &s;hews it to be fruitful enough. The low Land, near the River, e&s;pecially near the Sea, is &s;wampy, producing nothing but Reeds, or Bamboes:
<PB N="181" REF="189">
<MILESTONE N="1690" UNIT="year"> But the higher Ground, which is of a rea&s;onable heighth, is very fruitful. The Mould is deep, and is either black or yellow; and in &s;ome places Clay; or &s;uch Mould as is very proper for making Bricks.</P>
<P>The Trees in the Woods are mo&s;tly large bodied, &s;traight and tall: They are of divers &s;orts, &s;ome or other of them fit for any u&s;es. The Fruits of the Country are much the &s;ame as at <HI>Achin</HI> and <HI>Malaca, viz.</HI> Limes, Oranges, Guava's, Plantains, Bonanoes, Coco Nuts, Jacks, Durains, Mangoes, Manga&s;tans; Pomkins, Pine apples, and Pepper. The Roots are Yams, and Potatoes: Rice grows here pretty well al&s;o; but whether the Natives &s;ow enough for their own &s;pending or no, I know not. The Land Ani|mals are Buffaloes, Bullocks, Deer, Wild Hogs, Por|cupines, Guanoes, Lizards, &amp;c. The tame Fowls are Ducks and Dunghil Fowls, both in great plenty. The wild Fowl are Parrots, Parakites, Pidgeons, Turtle-Doves, and many &s;ort of &s;maller Birds.</P>
<P>The Natives al&s;o are &s;warthy <HI>Indians,</HI> like their Neighbours of <HI>Achin.</HI> They are &s;lender, &s;traight, active, and indu&s;trious. They are &s;ociable and de&s;i|rous of Trade; but if they are affronted, they are treacherous and revengeful. They live together in Towns, and &s;peak the <HI>Malayan</HI> Language: Con|forming them&s;elves in their Habit, Food, and Cu|&s;toms to other <HI>Malayans;</HI> who are all, &s;o far as I learnt, of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion. There are &s;ome Mechanicks among them; a few Smiths: But mo&s;t of them are Carpenters, and let them&s;elves out to hire to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at the Fort. The Hatchets they work with are &s;uch as they u&s;e at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> &s;o con|trived as to &s;erve al&s;o for an Ads. Here are al&s;o Fi&s;hermen, who get a livelihood by Fi&s;hing; and there are &s;everal &s;orts of Fi&s;h on the Coa&s;t, be&s;ides plenty of Green Turtle: Such of the <HI>Malayans</HI> as live near the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fort are u&s;ually employed in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Companies Service, to work for
<PB N="182" REF="190">
<MILESTONE N="1690" UNIT="year"> them: but the Country People are mo&s;t Husband|men. They plant Roots, Rice, Pepper-bu&s;hes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Pepper is the chief vendible Commodity in this Country, it thrives very well on all the Coa&s;t; but the greate&s;t quantity of what is exported from hence, is either brought down this River out of the Country, or fetched from <HI>Sillabar,</HI> or other places bordering on the Sea in &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els. Pepper grows plenty in other places of this I&s;land; as at <HI>Indrapore, Panga&s;anam, Jamby, Bancalis,</HI> &amp;c. It grows al&s;o on the I&s;land <HI>Java,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malacca, Malabar, Cochinchina,</HI> &amp;c. The Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar</HI> is &s;aid to produce the be&s;t; or at lea&s;t there the Natives take mo&s;t care to have the be&s;t, by letting it grow till it is full ripe; for which rea&s;on it is larger and fairer than here, where they gather it too &s;oon, to avoid lo&s;ing any: for as &s;oon as it grows ripe 'tis apt to &s;hed, and fall in wa&s;te to the ground.</P>
<P>It was the Pepper Trade that drew our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants to &s;ettle here. For after <HI>Bantam</HI> was lo&s;t, our <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who were wont to trade thither for this &s;pice, were at a great lo&s;s to regain the Pepper Trade, which now was in a manner fallen with the other &s;orts of Spice into the hands of the <HI>Dutch:</HI> tho' the Pepper which we were wont to fetch from <HI>Ban|tam</HI> did not all grow on this I&s;land <HI>Java,</HI> nor perhaps the tenth part of it; for as I have been informed it came mo&s;t from <HI>Sumatra,</HI> particularly from <HI>Bencooly,</HI> and the adjacent parts. For this Rea&s;on it behoved our Merchants to get an Intere&s;t here to prop up their declining Trade. Yet, as I have been told, the &s;ucce&s;s was more owing to the Natives of this place than them&s;elves; for that &s;ome of the <HI>Raja</HI>'s of the Country &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adors to <HI>Fort St. George</HI> to invite the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hither to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, be|fore the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hould get it; who are never &s;lack to promote their Intere&s;t, and were now &s;etting out on the &s;ame de&s;ign. But however that were, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had the good fortune to get hither fir&s;t:
<PB N="183" REF="191">
<MILESTONE N="1690" UNIT="year"> though &s;o narrowly, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were within an ace of preventing them, their Ships being in &s;ight before our Men got a&s;hore. But the <HI>Dutch</HI> coming thus too late, were put by their de&s;igns; for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> immediately got a&s;hore &s;ome Guns, and &s;tood ready to defend their intere&s;t. This might happen about the Year 1685, as I was informed; for they told me it was 5 or 6 years before I came hither: and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> immediately fortified them|&s;elves. The Fort, as I &s;aid before, fronts to the Sea, and &s;tands about 100 paces from the River. There has been a great deal of co&s;t be&s;towed on it, but to little purpo&s;e; for 'tis the mo&s;t irregular piece I ever &s;aw. I told the Governor the be&s;t way was to new model it, and face it with Stone or Brick, either of which might be ea&s;ily had. He &s;aid he liked my Coun&s;el, but being &s;aving for the Com|pany, he rather cho&s;e to repair it, by the making &s;ome Alterations: but &s;till to as little purpo&s;e, for 'twas all made ground and having no facing to keep it up, 'twould moulder away every wet &s;ea&s;on, and the Guns often fall down into the Ditches. What was po&s;&s;ible to be done I endeavoured to do while I was there. I made the Ba&s;tions as regular as I could upon the Model they were made by: and whereas the Fort was de&s;igned to be a <HI>Pentagone,</HI> and there were but 4 of the Ba&s;tions made, I &s;ta|ked out ground for a 5th, and drew a plan of it, which I gave the Government; and had I &s;taid longer I &s;hould have made up the other Ba&s;tion: but the whole Plan is too big by half for &s;o &s;orry a Gari&s;on; and the be&s;t way of mending it, is to de|moli&s;h all of it, and make a new one.</P>
<P>The Fort was but &s;orrily governed when I was there; nor was there that care taken to keep a fair Corre&s;pondence with the Natives in the Neighbour|hood as I think ought to be, in all Trading places e&s;pecially. When I came thither there were 2 Neigh|bouring <HI>Raja</HI>'s in the Stocks, for no other rea&s;on, but
<PB N="184" REF="192">
<MILESTONE N="1690" UNIT="year"> becau&s;e they had not brought down to the Fort &s;uch a quantity of Pepper as the Governor had &s;ent for. Yet the&s;e <HI>Raja</HI>'s rule in the Country, and have a con&s;iderable number of Subjects: Who were &s;o exa&s;perated at the&s;e In&s;olencies, that, as I have &s;ince been informed, they came down and a&s;&s;anlt|ed the Fort, under the Conduct of one of the&s;e <HI>Raja</HI>'s. But the Fort, as bad as it is, is Guard e|nough again&s;t &s;uch indifferent Soldiers as they are: Who tho' they have Courage enough, yet &s;carce any Arms be&s;ides Back-&s;words, Cre&s;&s;ets, and Lances, nor skill to u&s;e Artillery, if they had it. At ano|ther Time they made an Attempt to &s;urprize the Fort, under pretence of a Cock match; to which they hoped the Garri&s;on would come out to &s;hare in the Sport, and &s;o the Fort left with &s;mall Defence. For the <HI>Malayans</HI> here are great lovers of Cock|fighting, and there were about 1000 of them got together about this Match, while their armed Men lay in ambu&s;h. But it &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> that none of the Garri&s;on went out to the Cock match, but one <HI>John Necklin,</HI> a <HI>Dane,</HI> who was a great Game&s;ter him&s;elf: And he di&s;covering the Ambu&s;h, gave notice of it to the Governor; who was in Di&s;order enough upon their Approach: But a few of the great Guns drove them away.</P>
<P>I have nothing more to add but what concerns my &s;elf; which is not &s;o material, that I &s;hould need to trouble the Reader with it. I have &s;aid in my former Volume, <HI>p.</HI> 519. upon what Motives I left <HI>Bencouli:</HI> And the particulars of my Voyage thence to <HI>England</HI> are al&s;o in that Volume: So that I may here conclude this Supplement to my <HI>Voyage round the World.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AMong other things referr'd to in my for|mer Volume, I mentioned an Account I intended to give of the Bay of <HI>Cam|peachy,</HI> where I lived fir&s;t and la&s;t about 3 Years. I &s;hall now di&s;charge my &s;elf of that Promi&s;e; and becau&s;e my <HI>Campeachy Voyages</HI> were in order of time, before that <HI>Round the World,</HI> I &s;hall upon this occa|&s;ion go &s;o far back as to &s;peak briefly of my fir&s;t going to <HI>Sea,</HI> and the Rambles I made till my &s;etting out for <HI>Campeachy.</HI></P>
<P>My Friends did not originally de&s;ign me for the <HI>Sea,</HI> but bred me at <HI>School</HI> till I came to Years fit for a Trade. But upon the Death of my Father and Mother, they who had the di&s;po&s;al of me, took other Mea&s;ures; and having removed me from the <HI>Latine School</HI> to learn <HI>Writing</HI> and
<PB N="3" REF="196">
<MILESTONE N="1673" UNIT="year"> <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> they &s;oon after plac'd me with a Ma&s;ter of a Ship at <HI>Weymouth,</HI> complying with the Incli|nations I had very early of &s;eeing the <HI>World:</HI> With him I made a &s;hort Voyage to <HI>France:</HI> and return|ing thence, went to <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> being then about eighteen Years of Age. In this Voyage I &s;pent one <HI>Summer;</HI> but &s;o pinched with the rigour of that cold Climate, that upon my return I was ab&s;olutely again&s;t going to tho&s;e parts of the <HI>World,</HI> but went home again to my Friends. Yet going up a while after to <HI>London,</HI> the offer of a <HI>warm Voyage</HI> and a <HI>long</HI> one, both which I always de&s;ired, &s;oon carried me to Sea again. For hearing of an outward-bound <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Man, the <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Martha</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> Capt. <HI>Earning</HI> Commander, I entered my &s;elf aboard, and was employed before the Ma&s;t, for which my two former <HI>Voyages</HI> had &s;ome way qualified me. We went directly for <HI>Bantam</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Java,</HI> and &s;taying there about two Months, came home again in little more than a year; touching at St. <HI>Ja|go</HI> of the <HI>Cape Verd</HI> I&s;lands at our going out, and at <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> in our return. In this <HI>Voyage</HI> I gain'd more experience in Navigation, but kept no Journal. We arrived at <HI>Plymouth</HI> about two Months before <HI>Sir Robert Holms</HI> went out to fall upon the <HI>Dutch Smyrna</HI> Fleet: and the &s;econd <HI>Dutch</HI> Wars breaking out upon this, I forbore going to Sea that Summer, reti|ring to my Brother in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire.</HI> But growing wea|ry of &s;taying a&s;hore, I lifted my &s;elf on board the <HI>Royal Prince,</HI> Commanded by Sir <HI>Edward Sprague,</HI> and &s;erved under him in the Year 1673. being the la&s;t of the <HI>Dutch War.</HI> We had three En|gagements that <HI>Summer;</HI> I was in two of them, but falling very &s;ick, I was put aboard an Ho&s;pital Ship a day or two before the third Engagement, &s;eeing it at a di&s;tance only; and in this Sir <HI>Edward Sprague</HI> was kill'd. Soon after I was &s;ent to <HI>Harwich,</HI> with
<PB N="4" REF="197">
<MILESTONE N="1674" UNIT="year"> the re&s;t of the <HI>Sick</HI> and <HI>Wounded:</HI> And having langui|&s;hed a great while, I went home to my Brother to recover my health.</P>
<P>By this time the War with the <HI>Dutch</HI> was con|cluded; and with my health, I recovered my old Inclination for the Sea. A Neighbouring Gentleman, Colonel <HI>Hellier</HI> of <HI>Ea&s;t-Coker</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> my Native Pari&s;h, made me a &s;ea&s;onable offer to go and manage a Plantation of his in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> under one Mr. <HI>Whalley:</HI> for which place I &s;et out with Capt. <HI>Kent</HI> in the <HI>Content</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I was then about 22 Years old, and had never been in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> and therefore, le&s;t I might be trapann'd and &s;old as a <HI>Servant</HI> after my arrival in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> I agreed with Capt. <HI>Kent</HI> to work as a Seaman for my Pa&s;&s;age, and had it under his hand to be cleared at our fir&s;t arrival. We &s;ailed out of the River <HI>Thames</HI> in the beginning of the Year 1674. and meeting with favourable Winds in a &s;hort time got into the Trade-wind, and went merrily along, &s;teering for the I&s;land <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> When we came in &s;ight of it Captain <HI>Kent</HI> told his Pa&s;&s;engers, if they would pay his Port-Charges he would anchor in the Road, and &s;top whil&s;t they got refre&s;hment: But the Merchants not caring to part with their Money, he bore away, directing his Cour&s;e towards <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>The next I&s;land that appeared in our view was St. <HI>Lucia.</HI> 'Tis di&s;tant from <HI>Barbadoes</HI> about 30 Leagues, and very wealthy in large Timber Trees fit for all u&s;es. For this rea&s;on 'tis often vi&s;ited by the <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> who &s;tock them&s;elves here with Rollers, &amp;c. They have endeavoured to &s;ettle an <HI>Engli&s;h Co|lony</HI> there, but hitherto un&s;ucce&s;sfully, becau&s;e of the <HI>Caribbe-Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbees</HI> are a &s;ort of Warlike <HI>Indians,</HI> de|lighting to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ove on the Sea in Periagoes or large Canoas. Their chiefe&s;t Habitations are on the Main;
<PB N="5" REF="198">
<MILESTONE N="1674" UNIT="year"> but at certain Sea&s;ons of the Year they vi&s;it the I&s;lands for their Plea&s;ure. <HI>Barbadoes</HI> was former|ly much frequented by them; but &s;ince the En|gli&s;h &s;ettled there they have been forced to abandon it, and content them&s;elves in their Sea-Voyages, or with &s;uch I&s;lands only as are not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Europeans;</HI> except where they have hopes of conquering; as they have done at St. <HI>Lucia.</HI></P>
<P>Near the Main where the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> live, lies <HI>Tabago,</HI> which, when it was fir&s;t &s;ettled by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> was much infe&s;ted by them. The&s;e <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> as I have heard, had formerly Planta|tions on mo&s;t of the <HI>Caribbe-I&s;lands;</HI> and in their <HI>Sea Voyages</HI> did u&s;e to remain 3 Weeks or a Month at a time on an I&s;land, and then remove to ano|ther; and &s;o vi&s;it mo&s;t of them before their re|turn to the Main.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Vincent</HI> is another of the&s;e I&s;lands lying near St. <HI>Lucia:</HI> We pa&s;&s;ed between them; and &s;eeing a &s;moke on St. <HI>Lucia,</HI> we &s;ent our Boat a&s;hore there. Our men found &s;ome of the <HI>Caribbe-Indians,</HI> and bought of them Plantains, Bonanoes, Pine-Apples, and Sugar-Canes; and returning aboard again, there came with them a Canoa with 3 or 4 of the <HI>Indians.</HI> The&s;e often repeated the word <HI>Captain Warner,</HI> and &s;eemed to be in &s;ome di&s;quiet about him. We did not then under&s;tand the meaning of it; but &s;ince I have been informed that this Captain <HI>War|ner,</HI> whom they mentioned, was born at <HI>Antego,</HI> one of our Engli&s;h I&s;lands, and the Son of Gover|nour <HI>Warner,</HI> by an <HI>Indian Women,</HI> and bred up by his Father after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> manner; he learn|ed the <HI>Indian</HI> Language al&s;o of his Mother; but being grown up, and finding him&s;elf de&s;pi&s;ed by his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Kindred, he for&s;ook his Fathers Hou&s;e, got away to St. <HI>Lucia,</HI> and their lived among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>Caribbe-Indians,</HI> his Relations by the Mother

<MILESTONE N="1674" UNIT="year"> &s;ide. Where conforming him&s;elf to their Cu|&s;toms he became one of their Captains, and roved from one I&s;land to another, as they did. About this time the <HI>Caribbees</HI> had done &s;ome &s;poil on our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations at <HI>Antego:</HI> and therefore Governour <HI>Warner</HI>'s Son by his Wife took a Party of Men and went to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e <HI>Indians;</HI> and came to the Place where his Brother the <HI>Indian-Warner</HI> lived. Great &s;eeming Joy there was at their Meet|ing; but how far it was real the Event &s;hewed; for the <HI>Engli&s;h Warner</HI> providing plenty of Liquor, and inviting his half Brother to be merry with him, in the mid&s;t of his Entertainment ordered his Men upon a &s;ignal given to murder him and all his <HI>Indians;</HI> which was accordingly performed. The Rea&s;on of this inhumane Action is diver&s;ly repor|ted; &s;ome &s;ay that this <HI>Indian Warner</HI> committed all the &s;poil that was done to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and there|fore for that Rea&s;on his Brother kill'd him and his Men. Others that he was a great Friend to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and would not &s;uffer his Men to hurt them, but did all that lay in his power to draw them to an amicable Commerce; and that his Brother kill'd him, for that he was a&s;hamed to be Related to an <HI>Indian.</HI> But be it how it will, he was call'd in que&s;tion for the Murder, and forced to come home to take his Tryal in <HI>Eng|land.</HI> Such perfidious Doings as the&s;e, be&s;ide the Ba&s;ene&s;s of them, are great hindrances of our gaining an Intere&s;t among the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Putting from the&s;e I&s;lands we &s;teered away fur|ther <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and falling in with the Ea&s;t end of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> we ranged down along on the South &s;ide even to <HI>Cape Tihuron,</HI> which is the <HI>We&s;t-end</HI> of the I &s;land. There we lay by and &s;ent our Boat a&s;hore; for Captain <HI>Kent</HI> had been informed that there were great Groves of <HI>Orange-Trees</HI> near this Cape; but our Men not finding any, he then
<PB N="7" REF="200">
<MILESTONE N="1674" UNIT="year"> concluded there were none: But I have been &s;ince informed my &s;elf by &s;everal that have been there, that their are enough of them thereabouts. From hence we &s;teered away for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where we ar|rived in a &s;hort time, bringing with us the fir&s;t News they had of the Peace with the Dutch.</P>
<P>Here, according to my Contract, I was immedi|ately di&s;charged; and the nevt day I went to the <HI>Spani&s;h Town,</HI> call'd <HI>Sant' Jago de la Vega;</HI> where meeting with Mr. <HI>Whalley,</HI> we went together to Colonel <HI>Hellier</HI>'s Plantation in 16 <HI>Mile-Walk.</HI> In our way thither we pa&s;t through <HI>Sir Tho. Muddiford</HI>'s Plantation, at the <HI>Angells,</HI> where at that time were <HI>Otta</HI> and <HI>Cacao Trees</HI> growing; and fording a pretty large River, we pa&s;t by the &s;ide of it 2 or 3 Miles up the Stream, there being high Mountains on each &s;ide, The way to 16 <HI>Mile-Walk</HI> was formerly a great deal about, round a large Mountains; till Mr. <HI>Cary Hellier,</HI> the Colonel's Brother, found out this way. For being de&s;irous of making out a &s;horter cut, he and &s;ome others coa&s;ted along the River, till they found it run between a Rock that &s;tood up perpendicularly &s;teep on each &s;ide, and with much difficulty they climbed over it. But a Dog that belonged to them, finding a hole to creep through the Rock, &s;ugge&s;ted to them that there was a hollow Pa&s;&s;age; and he clear'd it by blowing up the Rock with Gunpowder, till he had made a way through it broad enough for a Hor&s;e with a Pack, and high enough for a Man to ride through. This is called the <HI>Hollow Rock.</HI> Some other Places he levell'd, and made it an in|different good Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>He was a very ingenious Gentleman, and doubt|le&s;s had he lived, he might have propagated &s;ome advantagious Arts on that I&s;land. He was once endeavouring to make <HI>Salt Petre</HI> at the <HI>Angells,</HI> but did not bring it to Perfection. Whether the
<PB N="8" REF="201">
<MILESTONE N="1674" UNIT="year"> Earth there was not right, I know not; but pro|bably there may be <HI>Saltpetre Earth</HI> in other Places, e&s;pecially about Pa&s;&s;age-Fort, where as I have been informed, the Canes will not make good Sugar, by Rea&s;on of the Saltne&s;s of the Soil.</P>
<P>I liv'd with Mr. <HI>Whalley</HI> at 16 <HI>Mile-walk</HI> for almo&s;t &s;ix Months, and then entred my &s;elf into the Service of one Captain <HI>Heming,</HI> to manage his Plantation at <HI>St. Anns,</HI> on the North &s;ide of the I&s;land, and accordingly rode from <HI>St. Jago de la Vega</HI> toward <HI>St. Anns.</HI></P>
<P>This Road has but &s;orry accommodations for Travellers. The fir&s;t night I lay at a poor Hun|ters Hut, at the foot of <HI>Mount Diabolo</HI> on the <HI>South</HI> &s;ide of it, where for want of Clothes to cover me in the Night I was very cold when the Land-wind &s;prang up.</P>
<P>This Mountain is part of the great Ridge that runs the length of the I&s;land from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t;</HI> to the Ea&s;t 'tis call'd the <HI>Blew Mountain,</HI> which is higher than this. The next day cro&s;&s;ing Mount <HI>Diabolo,</HI> I got a hard Lodging at the Foot of it on the North &s;ide; and the third day after arrived at Captain <HI>Heming</HI>'s Plantation.</P>
<P>I was clearly out of my Element there, and therefore as &s;oon as Captain <HI>Heming</HI> came thither I di&s;ingaged my &s;elf from him, and took my pa&s;|&s;age on Board a Sloop to <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> with one Mr. <HI>Statham,</HI> who u&s;ed to trade round the I&s;land, and touched there at that time.</P>
<P>From <HI>Port-Royal</HI> I &s;ailed with one Mr. <HI>Fi&s;hook,</HI> who traded to the North &s;ide of the I&s;land, and &s;ometimes round it: and by the&s;e coa&s;ting <HI>Voy|ages</HI> I came acquainted with all the Ports and Bays about <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and with all their Manu|factures; as al&s;o with the Benefit of the Land and Sea-winds. For our Bu&s;ine&s;s was to bring Goods
<PB N="9" REF="202">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> to, or carry them from Planters to <HI>Port-Royal;</HI> and we were always entertain'd civilly by them, both in their Hou&s;es and Plantations, having Liberty to walk about and view them. They gave us al&s;o Plantains, Yams, Potatoes &amp;c. to carry aboard with us; on which we fed commonly all our Voyage.</P>
<P>But after &s;ix or &s;even Months, I left that Employ al&s;o, and &s;hipt my &s;elf aboard one Capt. <HI>Hud&s;el,</HI> who was bound to the Bay of <HI>Campeachy</HI> to load <HI>Logwood.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ailed from <HI>Port-Royal</HI> about the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1675. in Company with Capt. <HI>Wren</HI> in a &s;mall <HI>Jamaica</HI> Bark, and Capt. <HI>John&s;on</HI> Com|mander of a Ketch belonging to <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>This Voyage is all the way before the Wind, and therefore Ships commonly &s;ail it in 12 or 14 Days; Neither were we longer in our Pa&s;&s;age; for we had very fair Weather, and touch'd no where till we came to <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> I&s;land in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> which is the only place they go to. In our way thither we fir&s;t &s;ailed by little <HI>Caimanes,</HI> leaving it on our Larboard &s;ide, and <HI>Key Monbrack,</HI> which are two &s;mall I&s;lands, lying South of <HI>Cuba.</HI> The next Land we &s;aw was the I&s;le of <HI>Pines;</HI> and &s;teering &s;till We&s;terly, we made <HI>Cape Corien|tes:</HI> and &s;ailing on the South &s;ide of <HI>Cuba,</HI> till we came to <HI>Cape Antonio,</HI> which is the We&s;t end of it, we &s;tretched over towards the <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> and fell in with <HI>Cape Catoch,</HI> which is in the extream part of that Promontory towards the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Land trends from this Cape one way South about 40 Leagues till you come to the I&s;land <HI>Cozumel,</HI> and from thence it runs S. W. down into the Bay of <HI>Honduras.</HI> About 10 Leagues from <HI>Cape Catoch,</HI> be|tween it and <HI>Cozumel,</HI> lies a &s;mall I&s;land called by the Spaniards <HI>Key-Muger,</HI> or <HI>Womens-I&s;land;</HI> becau&s;e 'tis reported that when they went fir&s;t to &s;ettle in the&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="203">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> parts they left their Wives there, while they went over on the Main to find &s;ome better habitation: Tho' now they have no &s;ettlement near it, whatever they have had formerly.</P>
<P>About 3 Leagues from <HI>Cape Catoch,</HI> and ju&s;t again&s;t it is a &s;mall I&s;land called <HI>Loggerhead-Key;</HI> probably becau&s;e it is frequently vi&s;ited by a &s;ort of Turtle &s;o call'd: near this I&s;land we always find a great Ripling, which Seamen call the Rip-raps. This Cape, tho' it appears to be part of the Main, yet is divided from it by a &s;mall Creek, &s;carce wide enough for a Canoa to pa&s;s through, though by it 'tis made an I&s;land. This I have been credibly informed of by &s;ome, who yet told me that they made a &s;hift to pa&s;s it in a Canoa.</P>
<P>The Cape is very low Land by the Sea, but &s;ome|what higher as you go further from the &s;hore. It is all over-grown with Trees of divers &s;orts, e&s;pecially Logwood; and therefore was formerly much frequented by the <HI>Jamaica</HI> Men, who came thither in Sloops to load with it, till all the Logwood|trees near the Sea were cut down; but now 'tis wholly abandoned, becau&s;e the Carriage of it to the &s;hore repuires more labour, than the cutting, logging and chipping. Be&s;ides they find better Wood now in the Bays of <HI>Campeachy</HI> and <HI>Honduras,</HI> and have but a little way to carry it; not about 300 Paces, when I was there: whereas at <HI>Cape Catoch</HI> they were forc'd to carry it 1500 Paces before they left that Place.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cape Catoch</HI> we coa&s;ted along by the &s;hore, on the North &s;ide of <HI>Jucatan</HI> towards <HI>Cape Condecedo.</HI> The Coa&s;t lies neare&s;t We&s;t. The di&s;tance between the&s;e two Capes is about 80 Leagues. The &s;hore lies pretty level without any vi&s;ible Points or Bendings in the Land. It is Woody by the &s;hore, and full of &s;andy Bays and lofty Mangroves.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t place of note to the We&s;t of <HI>Cape Catoch,</HI> is a &s;mall Hill by the Sea, call'd the <HI>Mount,</HI> and
<PB N="11" REF="204">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> is di&s;tant from it about 14 Leagues, It is very remark|able, becau&s;e there is is no other High-Land on all this Coa&s;t. I was never a&s;hore here, but have met with &s;ome well acquainted with the Place, who are all of opinion that this Mount was not natural, but the Work of Men: And indeed it is very probable this place has been inhabited; for here are a great many large Ci&s;terns, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been made for the receiving of Rain-water, for there are no fre&s;h Springs to be found here, the Soil being all &s;andy and very &s;alt. So that, as I have been credibly informed by an intelligent Per&s;on, the Spaniards do fetch of it to make Salt-Petre. He al&s;o told me, that being once there in a Privateer, and landing &s;ome Men on the Bay, they found about 100 Packs of this Earth bound up in Palmeto leaves; and a <HI>Spani&s;h Mulatto</HI> to guard it. The Privateers at fir&s;t &s;ight of the Packs were in hopes there had been Maiz or Indian Corn in them, which they then wanted; but opening them they found nothing but Earth; and examining the <HI>Mu|latto</HI> for what u&s;e it was, he &s;aid to make Powder, and that he expected a Bark from <HI>Compeachy</HI> to fetch it away. He further told me, that ta&s;ting of it he found it very &s;alt; as all the Earth there|abouts was. So that 'tis not improbable that tho&s;e Ci&s;terns were made for the carrying on of Salt-Petre Work. But whatever was the de&s;ign at fir&s;t, it is now wholly laid a&s;ide: for there is no u&s;e made of them; neither are there any Inhabitants near this Place.</P>
<P>Between the <HI>Mount</HI> and <HI>Cape Condecedo,</HI> clo&s;e by the Sea, are many little Spots of Mangrove Trees, which at a di&s;tance appear like I&s;lands: but coming nearer, when other lower Trees appear, it &s;hews like ragged and broken Ground; but at la&s;t all the Land pre&s;ents it &s;elf to your view very even.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="205">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> The next place of note on this Coa&s;t is <HI>Rio de la Gartos,</HI> almo&s;t in the mid-way between <HI>Cape Cotoch</HI> and <HI>Cape Condecedo.</HI> This al&s;o is a very remarkable Place; for here are 2 Groves of High Mangroves, one on each &s;ide the River, by which it may be known very well. The River is but &s;mall, yet deep enough for Canoas. The Water is good, and I know not any other Brook of fre&s;h River on all the Coa&s;t from <HI>Cape Catoch</HI> till within 3 or 4 Leagues of <HI>Campeachy</HI> Town.</P>
<P>A little to the Ea&s;t of this River is a Fi&s;h-Range, and a &s;mall Indian Hutt or two within the Woods; where the Indian Fi&s;hers who are &s;ubject to the Spaniards, lye in the Fi&s;hing-Sea&s;ons, their Habi|tations and Families being farther up in the Country. Here are Poles to hang their Nets on, and Barbecues to dry their Fi&s;h. When they go off to Sea, they fi&s;h with Hook and Line about 4 or 5 Leagues from the &s;hore, for <HI>Snappers</HI> and <HI>Gropers,</HI> which I have already de&s;cribed in my Voyage round the World. Chap. 4. pag. 91.</P>
<P>Since the Privateers and Logwood-&s;hips have &s;ailed this way, the&s;e Fi&s;her-men are very &s;hy, having been often &s;napp'd by them. So that now, when they are out at Sea, if they &s;ee a Sail, they pre&s;ently &s;ink their Canoas even with the edge of the Water; for the Canoas when they are full of Water, will &s;ink no lower, and they them&s;elves lye ju&s;t with their heads above Water, till the Ship which they &s;aw is pa&s;s'd by or comes nigh. I have &s;een them under &s;ail, and they have thus vani&s;hed on a &s;udden. The Fi&s;h which they take near the Shore with their Nets, are <HI>Snooks, Dog-Fi&s;h,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Tarpoms.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tarpom</HI> is a large &s;caly Fi&s;h, &s;haped much like a Salmon, but &s;omewhat flatter. 'Tis of a dull Silver Colour, with Scales as big as a Half Crown. A large <HI>Tarpom</HI> will weight 25 or 30 Pound. 'Tis good &s;weet whol&s;ome Meat, and the Fle&s;h &s;olid and firm.
<PB N="13" REF="206">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> In its belly you &s;hall find two large Scalops of Fat, weighing two or three Pound each: I never knew any taken with Hook and Line; but are either with Nets, or by &s;triking them with Harpoons, at which the <HI>Mo&s;kito</HI>-Men are very expert. The Nets for this purpo&s;e are made with &s;trong double Twine, the Me&s;hes 5 or 6 Inches &s;quare. For if they are too &s;mall, &s;o that the Fi&s;h be not intang|led therein, he pre&s;ently draws him&s;elf a little back|ward, and then &s;prings over the Net: Yet I have &s;een them taken in a Sain made with &s;mall Me&s;hes in this manner. After we have inclo&s;ed a great number, whil&s;t the two ends of the Net were drawing a&s;hore, 10 or 12 naked Men have fol|lowed; and when a Fi&s;h &s;truck again&s;t the Net, the next Man to it gra&s;ped both Net and Fi&s;h in his Arms, and held all fa&s;t till others came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Be&s;ides the&s;e we had three Men in a Canoa, in which they mov'd &s;ide-ways after the Net; and many of the Fi&s;h in &s;pringing over the Net, would fall into the Canoa: And by the&s;e means we &s;hould take two or three at every draught. The&s;e Fi&s;h are found plen|tifully all along that &s;hore from <HI>Cape Catoch</HI> to <HI>Tri&s;t,</HI> e&s;pecially in clear Water, near &s;andy Bays; but no where in muddy or rocky Ground. They are al&s;o about <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and all the Coa&s;t of the Main; e&s;|pecially near <HI>Carthagena.</HI></P>
<P>We&s;t from <HI>Rio de le Gartos,</HI> there is a Look-out or Watch-tower, called <HI>Selam.</HI> This is a Place clo&s;e by the &s;hore, contrived by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for their <HI>Indians</HI> to watch in. There are many of them on this Coa&s;t: Some built from the Ground with Timber, others only little Cages placed on a Tree, big enough for one or two Men to &s;it in, with a Ladder to go up and down. The&s;e Watch-towers are never without an <HI>Indian</HI> or two all the day long; the <HI>Indians</HI> who live near any of them being obli|ged to take their turns.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="207">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> About three or four Leagues We&s;tward of <HI>Selam,</HI> is another Watch-box on a high Tree, called <HI>Linchanchee Lookout,</HI> from a large <HI>Indian</HI> Town of that Name, 4 Leagues up in the Country; and two Leagues farther within Land is another Town called <HI>Chinchanchee.</HI> I have been a&s;hore at the&s;e <HI>Lookouts,</HI> and have been either rowing in a Canoa or walking a&s;hore on all this Coa&s;t, even from <HI>Rio de la Gartos</HI> to Cape <HI>Condecedo:</HI> but did never &s;ee any Town by the &s;hore, nor any Hou&s;es be&s;ides Fi&s;hing-hutts on all the Coa&s;t, except only at <HI>Si&s;al.</HI> Between <HI>Selam</HI> and <HI>Linchanchee</HI> are many &s;mall regular Salt Ponds, divided from each other by little Banks; the bigge&s;t Pond not above 10 yards long and 6 broad.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the&s;e two Towns attend the&s;e Ponds in the Months of <HI>May, June,</HI> and <HI>July</HI> to gather the Salt, which &s;upplies all the Inland Towns of the&s;e Parts; and there is a &s;kirt of Wood between the Sea and the Ponds, that you can neither &s;ee them nor the People at work till you come a&s;hore.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Salt Ponds further We&s;t, about three or four Leagues, is the <HI>Lookout</HI> called <HI>Si&s;al.</HI> This is the highe&s;t and mo&s;t remarkable on all the Coa&s;t; it &s;tands clo&s;e by the Sea, and it is built with Timber. This is the fir&s;t Object that we make off at Sea; and &s;ometimes we take it for a Sail, till running nearer we di&s;cover the High Mangrove-trees appearing in &s;mall Tufts at &s;everal di&s;tances from it.</P>
<P>Not far from hence there is a Fort with 40 or 50 Soldiers to Guard the Coa&s;t; and from this place there is a Road through the Country to the City of <HI>Merida.</HI> This is the chiefe&s;t City in all the Province of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> it being inhabited mo&s;tly with Spani|ards: Yet there are many Indian Families among them, who live in great &s;ubjection, as do the re&s;t of the <HI>Indians</HI> of this Country.

Therefore when Privateers come on this Coa&s;t, they fear not to land and ram|ble about, as if they were in their own Country, &s;eeking for Game of any &s;ort, either Fowl or Deer; of both which there are great plenty, e&s;pecially of the latter, though &s;ometimes they pay dear for it: A &s;mall <HI>Jamaica</HI> Privateer once landed 6 or 7 Men at this <HI>Lookout</HI> of <HI>Si&s;al;</HI> who not &s;u&s;pecting any danger, ordered the Canoa with 3 or 4 Men to row along by the &s;hore, to take them in upon their giving a &s;ign or firing a Gun: But within half an hour they were attack'd by about 40 <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers, who had cut them off from the &s;hore, to whom they &s;urren|dered them&s;elves Pri&s;oners. The Spaniards carried them in triumph to the Fort, and then demanded which was the Captain. Upon this they all &s;tood mute, for the Captain was not among them; and they were afraid to tell the Spaniards &s;o, for fear of being all hanged for Straglers; Neither did any one of them dare to a&s;&s;ume that Title, becau&s;e they had no Commi&s;&s;ion with them, nor the Copy of it; for the Captains don't u&s;ually go a&s;hore without a Copy at lea&s;t, of their Commi&s;&s;ion, which is wont to &s;ecure both them&s;elves and their Men.&mdash;At la&s;t one <HI>John Hullock</HI> cock'd up his little crop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hat, and told them that he was the Captain; and the Spaniards demanding his Commi&s;&s;ion, he &s;aid it was aboard; for that he came a&s;hore only to hunt, not thinking to have met any Enemy.

This <HI>Key</HI> is not above 40 Paces long, and 5 or 6 broad, having only a little crooked Tree growing on it, and for that rea&s;on it is called <HI>One-Bu&s;h-Key.</HI> It &s;eems to be only a heap of Shells, for the I&s;land is covered with them. The greate&s;t part are Oy&s;ter-&s;hells. There are a great many Oy&s;ters-banks in this Lagune, and the adjacent Creeks; but none afford better, either for largene&s;s or ta&s;te, than the Bank about this I&s;land. In the wet Sea&s;on the Oy&s;ters as well of <HI>One-Bu&s;h-Key</HI> as other Places here, are made fre&s;h by the Fre&s;hes running out of the Country: But in the dry time they are &s;alt enough. In the Creeks they are &s;maller, but more numerous; and the Mangrove-Roots that grow by the &s;ides of the Creeks are loaden with them; and &s;o are all the Branches that hang in the Water.</P>
<P><HI>One-Bu&s;h-Key</HI> is about a Mile from the &s;hore; and ju&s;t again&s;t the I&s;land is a &s;mall Creek that runs a Mile farther, and then opens into another wide La|gune; and through this Creek the Logwood is brought to the Ships riding at the <HI>Key.</HI> Between the Oy&s;ter-Banks that lye about the I&s;land and the Main, there is good Riding in about 12 Foot Wa|ter.
<PB N="18" REF="211">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> The bottom is very &s;oft Oaz, in&s;omuch that we are forced to &s;hooe our Anchors to make them hold. The Main by it is all low Mangrovy-Land, which is over-flow'd every Tide; and in the Wet Sea&s;on is covered with Water. Here we lay to take in our Lading.</P>
<P>Our Cargo to purcha&s;e Log-wood was Rum and Sugar; a very good Commodity for the Logwood-cutters, who were then about 250 Men, mo&s;t <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> that had &s;ettled them&s;elves in &s;everal Places hereabouts: Neither was it long before we had the&s;e Merchants came aboard to vi&s;it us; we were but 6 Men and a Boy in the Ship, and all little enough to entertain them: for be&s;ides what Rum we &s;old by the Gallon or Firkin; we &s;old it made into Punch, wherewith they grew Frolick&s;ome. We had none but &s;mall Arms to fire at their drinking Healths, and therefore the noi&s;e was not very great at a di&s;tance; but on Board the Ve&s;&s;els we were loud enough till all our Liquor was &s;pent: We took no Money for it, nor expected any; for Log-wood was what we came hither for, and we had of that in lieu of our Commodities after the rate of 5 Pound <HI>per</HI> Tun, to be paid at the Place where they cut it; and we went with our Long-boat to fetch &s;mall Quan|tities. But becau&s;e it would have taken up a long time to load our Ve&s;&s;el with our own Boat only, we hired a Periago of the Logwood-Cutters to bring it on Board; and by that means made the quicker di&s;patch. I made two or three Trips to their Huts, where I and tho&s;e with me were always very kindly entertain'd with Pig and Pork and Pea&s;e, or Beef and Dough-Boys. Their Beef they got by hunting in the <HI>Savannahs.</HI> As long as the Liquor la&s;ted, which they bought of us, we were treated with it either in Drams or Punch. But for a more particular account of the Logwood-Cutters I &s;hall refer the Reader to my &s;econd Voyage hither,
<PB N="19" REF="212">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> which I made &s;hortly after my return to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> becau&s;e I &s;aw a great pro&s;pect of getting Money here, if Men would be but diligent and frugal.</P>
<P>But let's proceed with our Voyage: It was the latter end of <HI>September,</HI> 1675. when we &s;ailed from <HI>One-Bu&s;h-Key</HI> with the Tide of Ebb; and anchored again at <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> that &s;ame Tide; where we watered our Ve&s;&s;el in order to &s;ail. This we accompli&s;hed in two Days, and the third day &s;ailed from <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> toward <HI>Jamaica.</HI> A Voyage which proved very tedious and hazardous to us, by rea&s;on of our Ships being &s;o &s;luggi&s;h a Sailor that She would not ply to Windward, whereby we were nece&s;&s;arily driven upon &s;everal Shoals that otherwi&s;e we might have avoided, and forced to &s;pend 13 Weeks in our Pa&s;&s;age, which is u&s;ually accompli&s;hed in half that time.</P>
<P>We had now a Pa&s;&s;enger with us, one <HI>Will. Wood|ers</HI> a <HI>Jamaica</HI> Seamen, that with three others that were taken by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> was &s;ent to the City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> where they remained Pri&s;oners &s;ix or eight Months, but at la&s;t wereremanded to <HI>La Vera Cruz,</HI> and from thence by Sea to <HI>Campeachy:</HI> They were not impri&s;oned, but only kept to work on Board the Ship that brought them, and &s;oon found an opportunity to make their e&s;capes in this man|ner. They had been imployed a&s;hore all the day, and being &s;ent aboard at Night, they fell to con|trive how to run away with the Boat; but con&s;idering that they wanted nece&s;&s;aries for their Voyage, they re&s;olved fir&s;t to go back and &s;upply them&s;elves, which they might then do the better, becau&s;e they knew there were none but a few <HI>Indians</HI> on Board. Accordingly having &s;eiz'd and bound the <HI>Indians,</HI> taking with them a Compa&s;s, with &s;ome Bread and Water, they put off to Sea, and arriv'd at <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> a Week before our departure: And this <HI>Will.

<P><PB N="20" REF="213">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> The third day, after we left <HI>Tri&s;t,</HI> about 8 in the Morning, near 12 or 14 Leagues W. S.

But <HI>Wooders</HI> with|&s;tood the Captains Propo&s;al, and told him, that when he came from <HI>Campeachy</HI> there were two &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;els ready to &s;ail for <HI>Toba&s;co</HI> River, which is not above 11 or 12 Leagues Leeward of <HI>Tri&s;t,</HI> and that it was more probable the&s;e were tho&s;e two Ve&s;|&s;els than any from <HI>Jamaica.</HI> Upon this we ed|ged off more to Sea, and they al&s;o alter'd their Cour&s;e &s;teering away &s;till directly with us; &s;o that we were now a&s;&s;ured they were <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and therefore we put away; quartering, and &s;teering N.

<P>While the Wind la&s;ted we thought our &s;elves but a degree from Pri&s;oners; neither had we yet great hopes of e&s;caping; for our Ketch, <HI>even when light,</HI> was but a dull Sailor, wor&s;e being deep loaden. However, we had now time to unbend the Fore&s;ail, and make a &s;tudding Sail of it, to put right be|fore the Sea-Breez when it &s;hould &s;pring up. This was accordingly done in a trice, and in le&s;s than an hour after the Breez &s;prung up fre&s;h, and we put right before the Wind. We had this advantage in it, that all the Sail we had did us &s;ervice; while on the contrary, tho&s;e who cha&s;ed us, being three
<PB N="21" REF="214">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> Ma&s;t Ve&s;&s;els, could not bring all theirs to draw.; for their After-&s;ails becalmed their Head-&s;ails, and we held them tack for two or three Hours, neither gain|ing nor lo&s;ing Ground. At la&s;t the Wind fre&s;hing on by the coming of a Tornado, we gained con&s;ide|rably of them; &s;o they fired a Gun and left their Cha&s;e, but we kept on crouding till Night; and then clapp'd on a Wind again and &s;aw no more of them.</P>
<P>In about a Fortnight after this, we were got as far to the Ea&s;t as <HI>Rio de la Gartos,</HI> and there overtook us a &s;mall <HI>Barmudoes</HI> Boat belonging to <HI>Jamaica</HI> which had not been above ten days come from <HI>Tri&s;t,</HI> who &s;ailed much better than we did. Therefore our Merchant went on board of Her, for he &s;aw we were like to have a long Pa&s;&s;age; and Provi&s;ion began to be &s;carce already, which he could not &s;o well brook as we. Our Cour&s;e lay all along again&s;t the Trade-wind.</P>
<P>All the hopes that we had was a good North, this being the only time of the Year for it: and &s;oon after we &s;aw a black Cloud in the N. W. (which is a &s;ign of a North, but of this more in my Di&s;cour&s;e of Winds) for two days, Morning and Evening. The third day it ro&s;e apace and came away very &s;wiftly. We pre&s;ently provided to receive it by furling all but our Main-&s;ail; intending with that to take the advantage of it. Yet this did us but little &s;ervice; for after an Hours time, in which it blew fre&s;h at N. W. the Cloud went away, and the Wind came about again at E. N. E. the u&s;ual trade in the&s;e Parts. We therefore made u&s;e of the Sea and Land-Breezes, as we had done before; and being now as high as the before mentioned <HI>Fi&s;hing Banks</HI> on the North of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> we &s;o ordered our Bu&s;ine&s;s, that with the Land-winds we run over to the Banks; and while it was calm between the Land-winds and Sea-Breez, we put out our Hooks and Lines and
<PB N="22" REF="215">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> fi&s;hed, and got plenty every Morning: One time our Captain after he had haled in a good Fi&s;h, being eager at his &s;port, and throwing out his Line too ha|&s;tily, the Hook hitched in the Palm of his Hand, and the weight off the Lead that was thrown with a jerk, and hung about &s;ix Foot from the Hook, forced the beard quite through, that it appeared at the back of his Hand.</P>
<P>Soon after this we got as high as the Mount, and then &s;tood off about 30 Leagues from Land, in hopes to get better to Windward there, than near the &s;hore; becau&s;e the Wind was at E. S. E. and S. E. by E. a fre&s;h gale: continuing &s;o 2 or 3 days. We &s;teered off to the North, expecting a Sea-Breez at E. N. E. and the third day had our de&s;ire. Then we tack'd and &s;teered in again S. E. for the &s;hore of <HI>Jucatan.</HI> Our Ketch, as I &s;aid, was a heavy Sailer, e&s;pecially on a Wind: for &s;he was very &s;hort; and having great round Bows, when we met a Head-Sea, as now, &s;he plunged and laboured, not going a-head, but tumbling like an Egg-&s;hell in the Sea. It was my fortune to be at the Helm from 6 a Clock in the Evening till 8. The fir&s;t 2 Gla&s;&s;es &s;he &s;teered very ill; for every Sea would &s;trike her dead like a Log; then &s;he would fall off 2 or 3 Points from the Wind, though the Helm was a Lee; and as &s;he recovered, and made a little way, &s;he would come again to the Wind, till another Sea &s;truck her off again. By that time 3 Gla&s;&s;es were out the Sea became more &s;mooth; and then &s;he &s;teered very well, and made pretty fre&s;h way through the Water. I was &s;omewhat &s;urprized at the &s;udden Change, from a rough Sea to a &s;mooth; and therefore looked over-board 2 or 3 times; for &s;he &s;teered open on the Deck, and it being very fair Weather, all our Men were layn down on the Deck and fallen a&s;leep. My Captain was ju&s;t behind me on the Quarter Deck fa&s;t a&s;leep too, for neither he nor they dreaded any Danger, we being

<P>But while I was mu&s;ing on the &s;udden alteration of the Sea, our Ve&s;&s;el &s;truck on a Rock, with &s;uch force that the Whip&s;taff threw me down on my back: This frighted me &s;o much that I cryed out, and bad them all turn out, for the Ship &s;truck. The &s;urge that the Ship made on the Rock, avvakened mo&s;t of our Men, and made them a&s;k, What the matter vvas? But her &s;triking a &s;econd time, &s;oon an&s;vvered the Que&s;tion, and &s;et us all to vvork for our Lives. By good fortune &s;he did not &s;tick, but kept on her way &s;till, and to our great comfort, the water was very &s;mooth, otherwi&s;e we mu&s;t certainly have been lo&s;t; for we very plainly &s;avv the Ground un|der us: &s;o we let go our Anchor, in 2 fathom Wa|ter, clean White Sand: When our Sails vvere furled, and a &s;ufficient &s;cope of Cable veered out, our Cap|tain, being yet in amaze, vvent into his Cabin, and mo&s;t of us with him to vievv his draught, and we &s;oon found vve were fallen foul of the <HI>Alcranes.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Alcranes</HI> are 5 or 6 low &s;andy I&s;lands, lying in the Lat. of about 23d. North, and di&s;tant from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Jucatan</HI> about 25 Leagues; the bigge&s;t is not above a Mile or two in Circuit. They are di&s;tant from one another 2 or 3 Miles, not lying in a Line, but &s;cattering here and there, with good Chan|nels of 20 or 30 Fathom Water, for a Ship to pa&s;s between.

On &s;ome there are a fevv lovv Bu&s;hes of Burton-vvood, but they are mo&s;tly Barren and Sandy, bearing nothing but only a little Chicken-Weed; neither have they any fre&s;h Water. Their Land-Animals are only large Rats, vvhich are in great Plenty; and of Fovvls, Boobies in va&s;tabundance, vvith Men of War and Egg-Birds. The&s;e inhabit
<PB N="24" REF="217">

The Boobies being mo&s;t numerous, have the greate&s;t portion of Land. The Egg-Birds, tho' they are many, yet being but &s;mall, take up but little room to the re&s;t: Yet in that little part which they inhabit, they are &s;ole Ma&s;ters, and not di&s;turbed by their Neighbours. All three &s;orts are very tame, e&s;pecially the Boobies, and &s;o thick &s;ettled, that a Man cannot pa&s;s through their Quarters, without coming within reach of their Bills, with which they continually peckt at us. I took notice that they &s;at in Pairs; and therefore at fir&s;t thought them to be Cock and Hen; but upon &s;triking at them, one flew away from each place, and that which was left behind &s;eemed as malicious as the other that was gone. I admired at the boldne&s;s of tho&s;e that did not fly away, and u&s;ed &s;ome &s;ort of violence to force them, but in vain; for indeed the&s;e were young Ones, and had not yet learned the u&s;e of their Wings, tho' they were as big and as well feathered as their Dams, only their Feathers were &s;omething whiter and fre&s;her. I took notice that an old one, either the Cock or Hen, always &s;at with the young to &s;ecure them; for otherwi&s;e the&s;e fowls would prey on each other, the &s;trong on the weak, at lea&s;t tho&s;e of a different Kind would make bold with their Neigh|bours: the Men-of-War-Birds as well as the Boo|bies left Guardians to the Young, when they went off to Sea, le&s;t they &s;hould be &s;tarved by their Neighbours; for there were a great many old and lame Men-of-War-Birds that could not fly off to Sea to &s;eek their own Food. The&s;e did not inhabit among their Con&s;orts, but were either expelled the Com|munity, or el&s;e cho&s;e to lye out at &s;ome di&s;tance

If one of the&s;e lame Birds found a young Booby not guarded, it pre&s;ently gave him a good poult on the back with his Bill to make him di&s;gorge, which they will do with one &s;troak, and it may be ca&s;t up a Fi&s;h or two as big as a Mans Wri&s;t; this they &s;wallow in a trice, and march off, and look out for another Prize. The &s;ound Men-of-War will &s;ometimes &s;erve the old Boobies &s;o off at Sea. I have &s;een a Man-of-War fly directly at a Booby, and give it one blow, which has cau&s;ed it to ca&s;t up a large Fi&s;h, and the Man-of-War flying directly down after it, has taken it in the Air, before it reach'd the Water.</P>

The Nur&s;e is ju&s;t like a Shark, only its Skin is rougher, and his u&s;ed for making the fine&s;t Ra&s;ps.

One Rea&s;on why we would have gone out to the North|ward, was, becau&s;e from our Main-top we &s;aw the I&s;lands to the Southward of us, and being unac|quainted, knew not whether we might find among them a Channel to pa&s;s through; our &s;econd rea&s;on was the hopes of making a better &s;lant in for the &s;hore, if we could weather the Ea&s;t end of the Riff. In order to this we weighed Anchor, keeping down by the &s;ide of the Riff till we were at the We&s;t end of it, which was about a League from where we Anchored: then we &s;tood off to the North, and there kept plying off and on to weather the Ea&s;t end of the Riff, three Days; but not being able to effect it, by rea&s;on of a &s;trong Current, &s;etting to the N.

<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> you cannot bring a Canoa within 20 or 30 Paces of the &s;hore. The South &s;ide of the I&s;land is low, flat, and rocky; the Rocks are perpendicularly &s;teep towards the Sea, &s;o that there is no Anchoring on that &s;ide; but the We&s;t-end very good in &s;andy Ground. The Body of the I&s;land is high Land, with many little Hills incompa&s;&s;ing a high Pike or Mountain &s;tanding in the middle. The Trees that grow here are of divers &s;orts, mo&s;t of them un|known to me. Red Mangroves grow in the low &s;wampy Land again&s;t the Sea, but on the firm hilly part Pine-Trees are mo&s;t plentiful.

<P>The Land-Animals are Bullocks, Hogs, Deer, &amp;c.

Yet the&s;e very Crabs that feed on Manchaniel, are venemous both to Man and Bea&s;t that feeds on them, though the others are very good Meat; the white Crabs are the large&s;t &s;ort; &s;ome of them are as big as a Mans two Fi&s;ts joyned together; they are &s;haped like Sea-Crabs, having one large Claw, wherewith they will pinch very

The&s;e white-ones built in wet &s;wampy dirty Ground near the Sea, &s;o that the Tide wa&s;hes in their Holes; but the black Crab is more cleanly, delighting to live in dry Places, and makes its Hou&s;e in &s;andy Earth: black Crabs are commonly fat and full of Eggs; they are al&s;o accounted the better Meat, tho' both &s;orts are very good.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o a great many Alligators and Croco|diles that haunt about this I&s;land, and are &s;aid to be the mo&s;t daring in all the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> I have heard of many of their Tricks; as that they have followed a Canoa, and put their No&s;es in over the Gunnal, with their Jaws wide open, as if ready to de|vour the Men in it: and that when they have been a&s;hore in the Night near the Sea, the Croco|diles have boldly come in among them, and made them run from their Fire, and taken avvay their Meat from them. Therefore when Privateers are hunting on this I&s;land, they always keep Sentinels out to vvatch for the&s;e ravenous Creatures, as duly as they do in other Places for fear of Enemies, e&s;pecially in the Night, for fear of being devoured in their &s;leep.</P>

<P>We were no &s;ooner at an Anchor, but five of us went a&s;hore, leaving only the Cook and Cabbin-Boy aboard: We had but two bad fowling Pieces in the Ship; tho&s;e we took with us, with a de&s;ign to kill Beef and Hog.

In the Evening we returned to our Boat weary and vext at our ill &s;ucce&s;s. The Boat&s;wain and his Con&s;ort were not yet returned, therefore we &s;tayed till 'twas dark, and then went aboard without them: the next Morning betimes we went a&s;hore again, as well to try our fortune at Hunting, as to recover our two Men which we thought might now be returned to the place where they landed; but not &s;eeing them, the Captain and I went again out to Hunt, but came back at Night with no better &s;ucce&s;s than before; neither did we &s;ee one Beef or Hog, though much track all the day. This day he that look'd to the Boat kill'd a young Sword-fi&s;h with the Boat-hook; there were a great many of them, as al&s;o Nur&s;es and Dog-fi&s;h, playing in &s;hole Water; he had al&s;o di&s;cover'd a &s;tream of Fre&s;h Water, but &s;o inclo&s;ed with thick red Mangroves, that 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to fill any in Ca&s;k; we could &s;carce get a little to drink.

Indeed the&s;e thoughts about their danger and our own, kept me waking all Night. However the next Morning betimes we went a&s;hore again, and before we got into the Lagune we heard a Gun fired, by which we knew that our Men were arrived; &s;o we fired another in an&s;wer and rowed away as fa&s;t as we could to fetch them, de&s;igning to fail as &s;oon as we came aboard; for by the flattering South and S.

All the Seamen but my &s;elf, were for going to the South Keys, alledging that our Ship being &s;uch a dull Sailer would never get to Wind-ward without the help of Sea and Land Breezes, which we could not expect at &s;uch a di&s;tance as we were, being out of the &s;ight of any Land: and that it was probable that in three or four days time we might be among the South Keys, if we would put for it; and there we &s;hould find Provi&s;ion enough, either Fi&s;h or Fle&s;h. I told them that the Craft was in Catching it, and it was as probable that we might get as little Food in the Souths Keys, as we did at <HI>Pines,</HI> where, though there was plenty of Beefs and Hogs, yet we could not tell how to get any: be&s;ides we might be &s;ix or &s;even days in getting to the Keys; all which time we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity fa&s;t, which if 'twere but two or three days, would bring us &s;o low, that we &s;hould be in a weak condition to Hunt.

Some of them did acquie&s;ce with me in my Opinion; how|ever, 'twas agreed to put away for the South Keys, and accordingly we veered out our Sheets, trimm'd our Sails, and &s;teered away N. N. W.

<P>As &s;oon as we came to Anchor, we &s;ent our Boat a&s;hore to buy Provi&s;ions to regale our &s;elves, after our long fatigue and fa&s;ting, and were very bu&s;ie going to drink a Bowl of Punch: When unexpectedly Capt. <HI>Rawlins,</HI> Commander of a &s;mall <HI>New-England</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, that we left at <HI>Tri&s;t;</HI> and one Mr. <HI>John Hooker,</HI> who had been in the <HI>Bay</HI> a Twelve-month cutting Logwood, and was now coming up to <HI>Jamaica</HI> to &s;ell it, came aboard, and were invited into the Cab|bin to drink with us; the Bowl had not yet been touch'd, (I think there might be &s;ix Quarts in it) but Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> being drunk to by Captain <HI>Rawlins,</HI> who pledg'd Capt. <HI>Hud&s;wel,</HI> and having the Bowl in his hand, &s;aid, That he was under an Oath to drink but 3 Draughts of &s;trong Liquor a Day, and putting the Bowl to his Head, turn'd it off at one Draught, and &s;o making him&s;elf drunk, di&s;appoin|ted us of our Expectations, till we made another Bowl. The next day having a bri&s;k N. W. Wind, which was a kind of <HI>Chocolatto North,</HI> we arrived at <HI>Port-Royal;</HI> and &s;o ended this trouble&s;ome Voyage.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was not long after our arrival at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> before we were payed off, and di&s;charged. Now Captain <HI>John&s;on</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> being bound again into the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> I took the oppor|tunity of going a Pa&s;&s;enger with him, being re|&s;olved to &s;pend &s;ome time at the Logwood Trade; and accordingly provided &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as were required about it <HI>(viz.)</HI> Hatchets, Axes, Macheats, (<HI>i. e.</HI> Long Knives) Saws, Wedges, &amp;c. a Pavillion to &s;leep in, a Gun with Powder and Shot, &amp;c. and leaving a Letter of Attorney with Mr. <HI>Fleming,</HI> a Merchant of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> as well to di&s;po&s;e of any thing that I &s;hould &s;end up to him, as to remit to me what I &s;hould order, I took leave of my Friends and Imbarked.</P>
<P>About the middle of <HI>Feb.</HI> 75, ---6. We &s;ailed from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and with a fair Wind and Weather, &s;oon got as far as <HI>Cape Catoch;</HI> and there met a pretty &s;trong North, which la&s;ted two days. After that the Trade &s;ettled again at E. N. E. which &s;peedily car|ried us to <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> I&s;land. In a little time I &s;etled my &s;elf in the We&s;t Creek of the We&s;t Lagune with &s;ome old Logwood-Cutters, to follow the Employ|ment with them. But I &s;hall proceed no farther with the Relation of my own Affairs, till I have
<PB N="42" REF="239">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> given a de&s;cription of the Country, and its Product, with &s;ome particulars of the Logwood-Cutters; their hunting for Beef, and making Hides, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have in my former Voyage de&s;cribed the Coa&s;t from Cape <HI>Catoch</HI> to Cape <HI>Condecedo.</HI> Therefore I &s;hall now begin where I then left off, and following the &s;ame method, proceed to give &s;ome Account of the Sea-coa&s;t of the Bay of <HI>Campeachy;</HI> being com|petently qualified for it by many little Excur&s;ions that I made from <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> during my Abode in the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Campeachy</HI> is a deep bending of the Land, contained between Cape <HI>Condecedo</HI> on the Ea&s;t, and a Point &s;hooting forth from the High-Land of St. <HI>Martins</HI> on the We&s;t. The di&s;tance between the&s;e two place is about 120 Leagues, in which are many large and navigable Rivers, wide Lagunes, &amp;c. Of all which I &s;hall treat in their order, as al&s;o of the Land on the Coa&s;t; its Soil, Product, &amp;c. To|gether with &s;ome Ob&s;ervations concerning the Trees, Plants, Vegetables, Animals, and Natives of the Country.</P>
<P>From Cape <HI>Condecedo</HI> to the <HI>Salinas</HI> is 14 or 15 Leagues; the Coa&s;t runs in South: It is all a Sandy Bay between, and the Land al&s;o within is dry and &s;andy, producing only &s;ome &s;crubbed Trees. Half|way between the&s;e two Places you may dig in the Sand above High-water Mark, and find very good fre&s;h Water.</P>
<P>The <HI>Salina</HI> is a fine &s;mall Harbour for Banks; but there is not above 6 or 7 Foot Water; and clo&s;e by the Sea, a little within the Land, there is a large Salt Pond, belonging to <HI>Campeachy</HI> Town, which yields abundance of Salt. At the time when the Salt Kerns, which is in <HI>May</HI> or <HI>June,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> of the Country are ordered by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to give their attendance, to rake it a&s;hore, and gather it into a great Pyramidal Heap, broad below and &s;harp at the top,
<PB N="43" REF="240">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> like the Ridge of a Hou&s;e; then covering it all over with dry Gra&s;s and Reeds, they &s;et Fire to it; and this burns the out-&s;ide Salt to a hard black Cru&s;t: The hard Cru&s;t is afterwards a defence again&s;t the Rains that are now &s;ettled in, and pre&s;erves the Heap dry even in the wette&s;t Sea&s;on. The <HI>Indians,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s I have told you, is to gather the Salt thus into Heaps, wait here by turns all the Kerning Sea&s;on, not le&s;s than 40 or 50 Families at a time; yet here are no Hou&s;es for them to lie in, neither do they at all regard it; for they are relieved by a fre&s;h &s;upply of <HI>Indians</HI> every Week; and they all &s;leep in the open Air, &s;ome on the Ground, but mo&s;t in very poor Hammocks fa&s;tned to Trees or Po&s;ts, &s;tuck into the Ground for that purpo&s;e. There Fare is no better than their Lodging; for they have no other Food, while they are here, but Tartilloes and Po&s;ole. Tartilloes are &s;mall Cakes made of the Flour of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn; and Po&s;ole is al&s;o <HI>Indian</HI> Corn boiled, of which they make their Drink. But of this more hereafter, when I treat of the Natives and their manner of Living. When the Kerning Sea&s;on is over, the <HI>Indians</HI> march home to their &s;ettled Habitations, taking no more care of the Salt. But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> who are owners of the Ponds, do frequently &s;end their Barks hither for Salt, to load Ships that lye in <HI>Campeachy</HI> Road; and afterwards tran&s;port it to all the Ports in the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> e&s;pecially to <HI>Aluarado</HI> and <HI>Tompeck,</HI> two great Fi&s;hing Towns: and I think that all the Inland Towns thereabouts, are &s;upplied with it; for I know of no other Salt Ponds on all the Coa&s;t, be&s;ides this and tho&s;e before mentioned. This <HI>Salina</HI> Harbour was often vi&s;ited by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Logwood-Cutters in their way from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to <HI>Tri&s;t.</HI> And if they found any Barks here, either light or laden, they made bold to take and &s;ell both the Ships and the <HI>Indian</HI> Sailors that belonged to them. This they
<PB N="44" REF="241">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> would tell you was by way of reprizal, for &s;ome former injuries received of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> though indeed 'twas but a pretence: for the Governours of <HI>Jamaica</HI> knew nothing of it, neither dur&s;t the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> complain; for at that time they u&s;ed to take all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships they met with in the&s;e Parts, not &s;paring even &s;uch as came laden with Sugar from <HI>Ja|maica,</HI> and were bound for <HI>England;</HI> e&s;pecially if they had Logwood aboard. This was done openly, for the Ships were carried into the <HI>Havanna,</HI> there &s;old, and the Men impri&s;oned without any Redre&s;s.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Salinas</HI> to <HI>Campeachy</HI> Town, is about 20 Leagues; the Coa&s;t runs S. by W. The fir&s;t 4 Leagues of it, along the Coa&s;t, is drowned Mangrove-Land, yet about two Mile South of the <HI>Salina,</HI> about 200 Yards from the Sea, there is a fre&s;h Spring, which is vi&s;ited by all the <HI>Indians</HI> that pa&s;s this way either in Bark or Canoa; there being no Water be&s;ides near it; and there is a &s;mall dirty Path leads to it thro' the Mangroves; after you are pa&s;t the&s;e Mangroves, the Coa&s;t ri&s;eth higher with many &s;andy Bays, where Boats may conveniently land, but no fre&s;h Water till you come to a River near <HI>Campeachy</HI> Town. The Land further along the Coa&s;t is partly Mangrovy but mo&s;t of it dry Ground, and not very fruitful; producing only a few &s;crubbed Bu&s;hes: and there is no Logwood growing on all this Coa&s;t, even from Cape <HI>Catoch</HI> to <HI>Campeachy</HI> Town.</P>
<P>About &s;ix Leagues before you come to <HI>Campeachy,</HI> there is a &s;mall Hill called <HI>Hina,</HI> where Privateers do commonly Anchor and keep Sentinels on the Hill, to look out for Ships bound to the Town: There is plenty of good Fire-wood, but no Water; and in the Surf of the Sea, clo&s;e by the &s;hore, you find abundance of Shell-fi&s;h, called by the <HI>Engli&s;h, Hor&s;e|hoofs,</HI> becau&s;e the under part or Belly of the Fi&s;h is flat, and &s;omewhat re&s;embling that Figure in &s;hape and Magnitude; but the Back is round like a Tur|tles;
<PB N="45" REF="242">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> the Shell is thin and brittle, like a Lob&s;ters; with many &s;mall Claws: and by report they are very good Meat; but I never ta&s;ted any of them my &s;elf.</P>
<P>There are three &s;mall low &s;andy I&s;lands, about 25 or 26 Leagues from <HI>Hina,</HI> bearing North from it, and 30 Leagues from <HI>Campeachy.</HI> On the South &s;ide of the&s;e I&s;lands there is good Anchorage; but neither Wood nor Water: and as for Animals, we &s;aw none, but only great numbers of large Rats and Plenty of Boobies, and Men-of-War-Birds. The&s;e I&s;lands are call'd the <HI>Triangles,</HI> from the Figure they make in their Po&s;ition. There are no other at any di&s;tance from the &s;hore, but the&s;e and the Alcranies, men|tioned in the former Chapter, in all this Coa&s;t that I have &s;een.</P>
<P>From <HI>Hina</HI> to <HI>Campeachy,</HI> as I have &s;aid before, is about 6 Leagues. <HI>Campeachy</HI> is a fair Town, &s;tanding on the &s;hore in a &s;mall bending of the Land; and is the only Town on all this Coa&s;t, even from Cape <HI>Catoch</HI> to <HI>La vera Cruz,</HI> that &s;tands open to the Sea. It makes a fine &s;hew, being built all with good &s;tone. The Hou&s;es are not high, but the Walls very &s;trong; the Roofs flatti&s;h, after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion, and covered with Pantile. There is a &s;trong Cittadel or Fort at one end, planted with many Guns, where the Governour re&s;ides with a &s;mall Garri&s;on to de|fend it. Though this Fort commands the Town and Harbour, yet it has been twice taken. Fir&s;t by Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Mims;</HI> who about the Year 1659. having &s;ummoned the Governour, and afterwards &s;tayed 3 days for an An&s;wer before he landed his Men, yet then took it by Storm, and that only with &s;mall Arms. I have been told that when he was advi&s;ed by the <HI>Jamaica</HI> Privateers, to take it by Stra|tagem in the Night, he replyed, that he &s;corned to &s;teal a Victory; therefore when he went again&s;t it, he gave them warning of his Approach, by his
<PB N="46" REF="243">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> Drums and Trumpets; yet he took the Fort at the fir&s;t On&s;et, and immediately became Ma&s;ter of the Place.</P>
<P>It was taken a &s;econd time by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Privateers, about the Year 1678, by &s;urprize. They landed in the Night about two Leagues from the Town, and marching into the Country, lighted on a Path that brought them thither. The next Morning near Sun-ri&s;ing, they entred the Town, when many of the Inhabitants were now &s;tirring in their Hou&s;es, who hearing a noi&s;e in the Street, looked out to know the Occa&s;ion; and &s;eeing armed Men marching to|wards the Fort, &s;uppo&s;ed them to be &s;ome Soldiers of their own Garri&s;on, that were returned out of the Country for about a Fortnight or 3 Weeks before, they had &s;ent out a Party to &s;uppre&s;s &s;ome <HI>Indians,</HI> then in Rebellion; a thing very common in this Country. Under favour of this Suppo&s;ition, the Privateers marched through the Streets, even to the Fort, without the lea&s;t Oppo&s;ition. Nay, the Town&s;-People bad them <HI>Good Morrow;</HI> and Congratulated their &s;afe return; not di&s;covering them to be Ene|mies, till they fired at the <HI>Sentinels</HI> on the Fort-wall, and pe&s;ently after began a furious Attack; and turning two &s;mall Guns, which they found in the Parade, again&s;t the Gates of the Fort, they &s;oon made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it. The Town is not very rich, though as I &s;aid before, the only <HI>Sea-port</HI> or all this Coa&s;t. The chiefe&s;t Manufacture of the Country is Cotton-Cloth; this &s;erves for cloathing the <HI>Indians,</HI> and even the poorer &s;ort of <HI>Spaniard</HI> wear nothing el&s;e. It is u&s;ed al&s;o for making Sails for Ships, and remitted to other parts for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Cotton-Cloth, and Salt fetched from the <HI>Salinas,</HI> I know of no other vendible Commodity exported hence. Indeed formerly this place was the Scale of the whole <HI>Logwood-Trade;</HI> which is there
<PB N="47" REF="244">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> fore &s;till called <HI>Palo</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> Wood) <HI>de Campeachy;</HI> tho' it did not grow nearer than at 12 or 14 Leagues di&s;tance from the Town.</P>
<P>The place where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did then cut it, was at a River called <HI>Champeton,</HI> about 10 or 12 Leagues to Leeward of <HI>Campeachy</HI> Town; the Coa&s;t from thence South, the Land pretty high and rocky. The Native <HI>Indians</HI> that lived hereabouts, were hired to cut it for a Ryal a Day, it being then worth 90, 100 or 110<HI>l. per Tim.</HI></P>
<P>After the Engli&s;h had taken <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and began to crui&s;e in this Bay, they found many Barks laden with it, but not knowing its value then, they either &s;et them adrift or burned them, &s;aving only the Nails and Iron work; a thing now u&s;ual among the Privateers; taking no notice at all of the Cargo; till Capt. <HI>James,</HI> having taken a great Ship laden with it and brought her home to <HI>England,</HI> to fit her for a Privateer; beyond his Expectation, &s;old his Wood at a great rate; tho' before he valu'd it &s;o little that he burned of it all his Pa&s;&s;age home. After his re|turn to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the Engli&s;h vi&s;iting this Bay, found out the Place where it grew, and if they met no Prize at Sea, they would go to <HI>Champeton</HI> River, where they were certain to find large Piles cut to their Hand, and brought to the Sea &s;ide ready to be &s;hipp'd off. This was their Common Practice; till at the la&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ent Soldiers thither to pre|vent their Depredations.</P>
<P>But by this time the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> knew the Trees, as growing; and under&s;tanding their value, began to rummage other Coa&s;ts of the Main, in &s;earch of it, till, according to their de&s;ire, they found large Groves of it, fir&s;t at Cape <HI>Catoch;</HI> (which, as I have &s;aid before, was the fir&s;t Place where they &s;ettled to Logwood-cutting) and loaded many Ve&s;&s;els from thence to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and other Places. But it growing &s;carce there, they found out the Lagune of <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> in the
<PB N="48" REF="245">
<MILESTONE N="1675" UNIT="year"> Bay of <HI>Campeachy;</HI> where they followed the &s;ame Trade, and have ever &s;ince continued it, even to the time of my being here: But to proceed.</P>
<P>From the River <HI>Champeton</HI> to <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> is about 18 Leagues; the Coa&s;t S. S. W. or S. W. by S. Low-land with a &s;andy Bay, again&s;t the Sea, and &s;ome Trees by the &s;hore, with &s;mall <HI>Savannahs,</HI> mixt with &s;mall &s;hrubby Woods within Land all the way. There is only one River between <HI>Champeton</HI> and <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> called <HI>Port E&s;condedo.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Port-Royal</HI> is a broad entrance into a Salt <HI>Lagune,</HI> of 9 or 10 Leagues long, and 3 or 4 wide, with 2 Mouths, one at each end. This Mouth of <HI>Port-Royal</HI> hath a Barr, whereon there is 9 or 10 Foot Water. Within the Barr it is deep enough, and there is good Anchoring on either &s;ide. The en|trance is about a Mile over, and two Miles in length; it hath fair &s;andy Bays on each &s;ide, with &s;mooth Landing.</P>
<P>Ships commonly anchor on the Weather or Ea&s;t &s;ide next <HI>Champeton,</HI> both for the convenience of &s;ome Wells they dug on the Bays by the Priva|teers and Log-wood-Cutters, as al&s;o to ride more out of the Tide, which here runs very &s;trong. This Place is remarkable enough, becau&s;e from hence the Land trends away We&s;t, and runs &s;o for about 65 or 70 Leagues farther.</P>
<P>On the We&s;t &s;ide of this Harbour is a low I&s;land, call'd by Us <HI>Port-Royal-I&s;land;</HI> which makes one &s;ide of the Mouth, as the Main does the other: It is about 2 Miles wide and 3 Leagues long, running Ea&s;t and We&s;t. The Ea&s;t end of this I&s;land is &s;andy and pretty clear of Woods, with &s;ome Gra&s;s, bear|ing a &s;mall prickly Bur, no bigger than a Grey Pea, which renders it very trouble&s;ome to tho&s;e that walk bare-foot, as the Bay-Men often do. There are &s;ome Bu&s;hes of Burton-wood: and a little further to the We&s;t grow large <HI>Sapadillo-Trees,</HI> who&s;e Fruit is
<PB N="49" REF="246">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> long and very plea&s;ant. The re&s;t of the I&s;land is more woody, e&s;pecially the North &s;ide, which is full of white Mangrove clo&s;e to the &s;hore.</P>
<P>On the We&s;t &s;ide of this I&s;land, is another &s;mall low I&s;land, called <HI>Tri&s;t,</HI> &s;eparated from the former by a &s;mall Salt Creek, &s;carce broad enough for a Canoa to paddle through.</P>
<P>The <HI>I&s;land Tri&s;t</HI> is in &s;ome Places three Miles wide, and about 4 Leagues in length; running E. and W. The Ea&s;t end is &s;wampy and full of white Mangroves; and the South &s;ide much the &s;ame: The We&s;t part is dry and &s;andy, bearing a &s;ort of long Gra&s;s, growing in Tufts very thin. This is a &s;ort of Savannah, with &s;ome large <HI>Palmeto-Trees</HI> grow|ing in it. The North &s;ide of the We&s;t end is full of <HI>Coco-Plum Bu&s;hes,</HI> and &s;ome Grapes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coco-Plum Bu&s;h</HI> is about 8 or 9 Foot high, &s;preading out into many Branches. Its Rind black and &s;mooth, the Leaves oval and pretty large, and of a dark Green. The Fruit is about the bigne&s;s of a Hor&s;e-Plum, but round; &s;ome are black, &s;ome white, others reddi&s;h: The Skin of the Plum is very thin and &s;mooth; the in&s;ide white, &s;oft and woolly, rather fit to &s;uck than bite, inclo&s;ing in the Middle a large &s;oft Stone. This Fruit grows commonly in the Sand near the Sea; and I have ta&s;ted &s;ome that have been &s;alti&s;h; but they are commonly &s;weet and plea&s;ant enough, and accounted very whol&s;om.</P>
<P>The Body of the <HI>Grape-Tree</HI> is about two or three Foot in Circumference, growing 7 or 8 Foot high, then &s;ends forth many Branches, who&s;e Twigs are thick and gro&s;s; the Leaves are &s;haped much like an Ivy Leaf, but broader and more hard; the Fruit is as big as an ordinary Grape, growing in Bunches or Clu&s;ters among the Twigs all over the Tree; it is black when ripe, and the in&s;ide reddi&s;h, with a large hard Stone in the middle. This Fruit is very plea&s;ant and whol&s;om, but of little &s;ub&s;tance, the Stones
<PB N="50" REF="247">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> being &s;o large: The Body and Limbs of the Tree are good Fewel, making a clear &s;trong Fire, there|fore often u&s;ed by the Privateers to harden the Steels of their Guns when faulty.</P>
<P>The Animals of this <HI>I&s;land</HI> are, <HI>Lizards, Guanoes, Snakes</HI> and <HI>Deer:</HI> Be&s;ide the common &s;mall <HI>Lizard,</HI> there is another &s;ort of a large kind, call'd a <HI>Lyon-Lizard:</HI> This Creature is &s;hap'd much like the other, but almo&s;t as big as a Man's Arm, and it has a large Comb on its Head; when it is a&s;&s;aulted it &s;ets its Comb up an end; but otherways it lies down flat: Here are two or three &s;orts of Snakes: &s;ome very large, as I have been told.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t end of the <HI>I&s;land</HI> clo&s;e by the Sea, you may dig in the Sand 5 or 6 foot deep, and find good fre&s;h Water: There are commonly Wells ready made by Seamen to water their Ships; but they &s;oon fill up, if not cleared; and if you dig too deep, your Water will be Salt. This <HI>I&s;land</HI> was &s;eldom clear of Inhabitants when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> vi&s;ited the Bay for Logwood; for the bigge&s;t Ships did always ride here in 6 or 7 fathom Water clo&s;e by the &s;hore; but &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els ran up 3 Leagues farther to <HI>One-Bu&s;h-Key,</HI> of which in my former Chapter.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Mouth or Entrance into this Lagune is between <HI>Tri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Beef-I&s;land,</HI> and is about 3 mile wide. It is &s;hoal without, and only two Channels to come in: The deepe&s;t Channel on the Spring Tide, has 12 Foot Water. It lyes near the middle of the Mouth; hard Sand on the Bar; the We&s;t Channel is about 10 Foot Water; and lyes pretty near <HI>Beef-I&s;land:</HI> you run in with the <HI>Sea-Breez,</HI> and &s;ound all the way; taking your &s;ounding from <HI>Beef-I&s;land</HI> &s;hore.

<P>This River, though but &s;mall, yet is big enough for <HI>Periagoes</HI> to enter. It di&s;embogues on the South &s;ide near the middle of the Lagune. There was formerly an <HI>Indian</HI> Village named <HI>Summa&s;enta,</HI> near the Mouth of the River; and another large <HI>Indian</HI> Town, called <HI>Chucquebul,</HI> 7 or 8 Leagues up in the Country. This latter was once taken by the Pri|vateers; by whom I have been informed, that there were about two thou&s;and Families of Indians in it, and two or three Churches, and as many Spa|ni&s;h Friers, though no white Men be&s;ide. The Land near this River yields plenty of Logwood.</P>
<P>From <HI>Summa&s;enta</HI> River to <HI>One-Bu&s;h-Key</HI> is 4 or 5 Leagues, the &s;hore running We&s;t. I have de&s;cribed <HI>One-Bu&s;h-Key,</HI> and the Creek again&s;t it, which, as I &s;aid, is very narrow, and not above a mile long before it opens into another wide Lake, lying near|e&s;t N. and S. called the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Lagune.</HI> It is about a League and a half wide, and 3 Leagues long, encom|pa&s;&s;ed with Mangrove-Trees. At the S. E. cor|ner of it there is another Creek about a mile wide at the Mouth, running 6 or 7 Miles into the Country; on both &s;ides of it grows plenty of Logwood; there|fore it was inhabited by Engli&s;hmen who lived in

<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> &s;mall Companies, from three to ten in a Company; and &s;etled them&s;elves at their be&s;t convenience for Cutting. At the Head of the Creek they made a path, leading into a large Savannah full of black Cattle, Hor&s;es and Deer; which was often vi&s;ited by them upon occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the North end, and about the middle of the Ea&s;t Lagune, there is another &s;mall Creek like that which comes out again&s;t <HI>One-Bu&s;h-Key,</HI> but le&s;s and &s;hallower, which di&s;chargeth it &s;elf into <HI>Laguna Termina,</HI> again&s;t a &s;mall &s;andy Key, called by the <HI>Engli&s;h Serles</HI>'s <HI>Key,</HI> from one Captain <HI>Serles,</HI> who fir&s;t Careen'd his Ve&s;&s;el here, and was afterwards kil|led in the We&s;tern Lagune, by one of his Company as they were cutting Logwood together. This Cap|tain <HI>Serles</HI> was one of Sir <HI>Henry Morgans</HI> Command|ers, at the Sacking of <HI>Panama;</HI> who being &s;ent out to crui&s;e in a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el in the South Seas, happened to &s;urprize at <HI>Taboca,</HI> the Boat&s;wain and mo&s;t of the Crew belonging to the <HI>Trinity,</HI> a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship, on Board which were the Friers and Nuns, with all the old Gentlemen and Matrons of the Town, to the number of 1500 Souls, be&s;ides an immen&s;e Trea&s;ure in <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Gold,</HI> as I was informed by Captain <HI>Peralta,</HI> who then Commanded her, as he did afterwards, when &s;he was taken by Captain <HI>Sharp;</HI> all which he might have taken in the Ship had he pur&s;ued her.</P>
<P>On the We&s;t &s;ide of the Ea&s;t Lagune, there is a &s;mall <HI>Skirt</HI> of Mangroves, that &s;eparates it from another running parallel with it, called the <HI>Ea&s;t-Lagune,</HI> which is abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> bigne&s;s of the former.</P>

<P>At the South end of this <HI>Lagune,</HI> there is a Creek about a mile wide at its Mouth; and half a mile from thence it divides into two Branches; one called

<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> the Ea&s;t, the other the We&s;t Branch, both deep enough for &s;mall Barks 7 or 8 Miles up.

Four Miles from the Mouth, the Land on both &s;ides the&s;e two Branches is wet and &s;wampy, affording only Mangroves by the Creeks &s;ides; only at the Heads of them, there are many large Oaks, be&s;ides which I did never &s;ee any grow|ing within the Tropicks: but 20 Paces within that grows plenty of Logwood, therefore the Cutters &s;ettled them&s;elves here al&s;o.</P>
<P>On the We&s;t &s;ide of the We&s;t Branch lyes a large Pa&s;ture for Cattle about 3 Miles from the Creek; to which the Logwood-Cutters had made paths from their Huts to hunt Cattle, which are always there in great numbers; and commonly fatter than tho&s;e in the Neighbouring <HI>Savannahs;</HI> and therefore was called the fat <HI>Savannah;</HI> and this We&s;t Creek was always mo&s;t inhabited by Logwood-Cutters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Logwood-Trade</HI> was grown very common before I came hither, here being as I &s;aid before, about 260 or 270 Men living in all the <HI>Lagune</HI> and at <HI>Beef-I&s;land,</HI> of which <HI>I&s;le</HI> I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter: This Trade had its Ri&s;e from the decay of <HI>Priva|teering;</HI> for after <HI>Jamaica</HI> was well &s;ettled by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and a Peace e&s;tabli&s;hed with <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>Privateers</HI> who had hitherto lived upon plundering the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> were put to their &s;hifts; for they had prodigally &s;pent whatever they got, and now wanting &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, were forced either to go to <HI>Petit Guavas,</HI> where the Privateer-Trade &s;till continued, or into the Bay for <HI>Logwood.</HI>&mdash;The more Indu&s;trous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ort of them came hither, yet even the&s;e, though they could work well enough if they plea&s;ed; y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> thought it a dry bu&s;ine&s;s to toil at Cutting Wood.

<P>Ths wild <HI>Pine</HI> is a Plant &s;o called, becau&s;e it &s;omewhat re&s;embles the Bu&s;h that bears the Pine: they are commonly &s;upported, or grow from &s;ome Bunch, Knot or Excre&s;cence of the Tree, where they take root, and grow upright. The Root is &s;hort and thick, from whence the Leaves ri&s;e up in folds one within another, &s;preading off at the top: They are of a good thick Sub&s;tance, and about 10 or 12 Inches long. The out-&s;ide Leaves are &s;o compact as to con|tain the Rain-water as it falls. They will hold a Pint and a half, or a Quart; and this Water refre&s;hes the Leaves and nouri&s;hes the Root. When we find the&s;e <HI>Pines,</HI> we &s;tick our Knives into the Leaves ju&s;t above the Root, and that lets out the Water, which we catch in our Hats, as I have done many times to my great relief.</P>
<P>The Land near the Sea or the Lagunes is Mangrovy, and always wet, but at a little di&s;tance from it, it is fa&s;t and firm, and never overflow'd but in the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> Sea&s;on. The Soil is a &s;trong yellowi&s;h Clay; But yet the upper Coat or &s;urface is a black mould, tho' not deep. Here grow divers &s;orts of Trees of no great bulk or height. Among the&s;e the Logwood-Trees thrive be&s;t, and are very plentiful; this being the mo&s;t proper Soil for them: for they do not thrive in day Ground; neither &s;hall you &s;ee any growing in rich black mould. They are much like our White-Thorns in <HI>England;</HI> but generally a great deal bigger:

We always chu&s;e to cut the old black-rinded Trees; for the&s;e have le&s;s &s;ap, and require but little pains to chip or cut it. The &s;ap is white, and the heart red: The heart is u&s;ed much for dying; therefore we chip off all the white &s;ap, till we come to the heart; and then it is fit to be tran&s;ported to <HI>Europe.</HI> After it has been chip'd a little while, it turns black; and if it lyes in the Water it dyes it like Ink; and &s;ometimes it has been u&s;ed to write with. Some Trees are 5 or 6 Foot in Circumference: and the&s;e we can &s;carce cut into Logs &s;mall enough for a Man's Burthen, without great Labour; and therefore are forced to blow them up. It is a very ponderous &s;ort of wood, and burns very well, making a clear &s;trong fire, and very la&s;ting. We always harden the Steels of our Fire-Arms, when they are faulty, in a <HI>Logwood|fire,</HI> if we we can get it, but otherways, as I &s;aid before, with <HI>Burton wood</HI> or the Grape-tree.

<P>The Land as you go farther from the Sea ri&s;eth &s;till &s;omewhat higher; and becomes of a more plan|table Mould: There the Trees are generally of ano|ther &s;ort; growing higher and taller than the Log|vvood-trees or any near them: Beyond this, you &s;till enter in large Savannahs of long Gra&s;s, two or three Miles wide; in &s;ome Places much more.</P>
<P>The Mould of the Savannahs is generally black and deep, producing a cour&s;e &s;ort of &s;edgy Gra&s;s: In the latter end of the dry time, vve &s;et fire to it, which runs like Wild-fire, and keeps burning as long as there is any Fewel; unle&s;s &s;ome good &s;hovver of Rain put it out: Then pre&s;ently &s;prings up a new green Crop, vvhich thrives beyond all belief.

<P>The Animals of this Country are, Hor&s;es, Bullocks, Deer, Warree, Precary, Squa&s;hes, Po&s;&s;ums, Mon|kies, Ant Bears, Sloths, Armadilloes, Porcupines, Land-turtle, Guanoes, and Lizards of all kinds.</P>
<P>The Squa&s;h is a four-footed Bea&s;t, bigger than a Cat: Its Head is much like a Foxes; with &s;hort Ears and a long No&s;e. It has pretty &s;hort Legs, and &s;harp Claws, by which it will run up Trees like a Cat. The Skin is covered with &s;hort fine yellowi&s;h Hair. The fle&s;h of it is good, &s;weet, whole&s;om Meat. We commonly &s;kin and roa&s;t it; and then we call it Pig; and I think it eats as well. It feeds on nothing but good Fruit; therefore we find them mo&s;t among the Sapadillo-Trees; This Creature never rambles very far: and being taken young, will become as tame as a Dog; and be as rogui&s;h as a Monkey.</P>
<P>The Monkies that are in the&s;e Parts are the uglie&s;t I ever &s;aw. They are much bigger than a Hare, and have great Tails about two foot and a half long. The under &s;ide of their Tails is all bare, with a black hard &s;kin; but the upper &s;ide, and all the Body is covered with cour&s;e, long, black, &s;taring Hair. The&s;e Creatures keep together 20 or 30 in a Company, and ramble over the Woods; leaping from Tree to Tree. If they meet with a &s;ingle Per&s;on they will threaten to devour him. When I have been alone I have been afraid to &s;hoot them, e&s;pecially the fir&s;t time I met them. They were a great Company dancing from Tree to Tree, over my Head; chatter|ing and making a terrible Noi&s;e; and a great many grim Faces, and &s;hewing Antick Ge&s;tures.

The Tails of the&s;e Monkies ars as good to them as one of their Hands; and they will hold as fa&s;t by them. If two or more of us were together they would ha&s;ten from us. The Females with their young ones are much troubled to leap after the Males; for they have commonly two: one &s;he carries under one of her Arms; the other &s;its on her back, and cla&s;ps her tvvo fore Paws about her Neck. The&s;e Monkies are the mo&s;t &s;ul|len I ever met with; for all the Art we could u&s;e, would never tame them. It is a hard matter to &s;hoot one of them, &s;o as to take it; for if it gets hold with its Clavvs or Tail, it will not fall as long as one breath of Life remains. After I have &s;hot at one and broke a Leg or an Arm, I have pitied the poor Creature to &s;ee it look and handle the vvounded Limb; and turn it about from &s;ide to &s;ide.

This Creature feeds on Ants; therefore you alvvays find them near an Ants Ne&s;t or Path. It takes its Food thus. It lays its No&s;e down flat on the Ground, clo&s;e by the Path that the Ants travel in, (whereof here are many in this Country) and then puts out his Tongue athwart the Path: the Ants pa&s;&s;ing forwards and

<P>The Sloth is a four-footed, hairy, &s;ad coloured Ani|mal; &s;omewhat le&s;s than the Ant-bear, &amp; not &s;o rough: Its Head is round, its Eyes &s;mall; it has a &s;hort No&s;e, and very &s;harp Teeth; &s;hort Legs, but extra or|dinary long &s;harp Claws. This Creature feeds on Leaves, whether indifferently of all &s;orts, or only on &s;ome particular kinds, I know not. They are very mi&s;chievous to the Trees where they come, and are &s;o &s;low in motion, that when they have eaten all the Leaves on one Tree, before they can get down from that and climb another, and &s;ettle them&s;elves to their fre&s;h Banquet (which takes them up 5 or 6 days, tho' the Trees &s;tand near: They are no|thing but &s;kin and bones, altho' they came down plump and fat from the la&s;t Tree. They never de|&s;cend till they have &s;tript every Limb and Bough, and made them as bare as Winter. It takes them up 8 or 9 Minutes to move one of their Feet 3 Inches forward; and they move all their four Feet one after another, at the &s;ame &s;low rate; neither will &s;tripes make them mend their pace; which I have tryed to do, by whipping them; but they &s;eem in&s;en&s;ible, and can neither be frighted, or provoked to move fa&s;ter.</P>

<P>The Bea&s;ts of prey that are bred in this Country are Tigre-Cats, and (as is reported by our Men) Lions. The Tigre-Cat is about the bigne&s;s of a Bull-Dug, with &s;hort Legs, and a tru&s;s Body, &s;haped much like a Ma&s;tiff, but in all things el&s;e, <HI>(viz.)</HI> its Head, the colour of its Hair, and the manner of its Preying, much re&s;embling the Tigre, only &s;ome|what le&s;s.

<P>Here are a great many poi&s;onous Creatures in this Country; more particularly Snakes of divers &s;orts, &s;ome yellow, &s;ome green, and others of a dun Colour, with black and yellowi&s;h &s;pots. The yellow

<P>It is reported that &s;ometimes they lirk in Trees: and that they are &s;o mighty in &s;trength, as to hold a Bullock fa&s;t by one of his Horns, when they hap|pen to come &s;o near that &s;he can twi&s;t her &s;elf about the Limb of the Tree and the Horn at once.

<P>The green Snakes are no bigger about than a Man's Thumb, yet 4 or 5 Foot long: The Backs are of a very lively green colour, but their Bellies in|clining to yellow. The&s;e are commonly in Bu&s;hes among the green Leaves, and prey upon &s;mall Birds. This I have often &s;een, and was once in danger to be bit by one before I &s;aw it: For I was going to take hold of a Bird that fluttered and cryed out ju&s;t by me, yet did not fly away, neither could I ima|gine the rea&s;on till reaching out my hand, I per|ceived the head of a Snake clo&s;e by it; and looking more narrowly, I &s;aw the upper part of the Snake, about two or three Inches from his Head, twi&s;ted about the poor Bird.</P>
<P>What they feed on be&s;ides Birds I know not, but they are &s;aid to be very venemous.</P>
<P>The dun coloured Snake is a little bigger than the green Snake, but not above a Foot and a half, or two Foot long; the&s;e we &s;hould often &s;ee in and about our Huts; but did not kill them, becau&s;e they de|&s;troyed the Mice, and are very nimble in chacing tho&s;e Creatures.

<P>Here are al&s;o a &s;ort of Spiders of a prodigious &s;ize, &s;ome near as big as a Man's fi&s;t, with long &s;mall Legs like the Spiders in <HI>England,</HI> they have two Teeth, or rather Horns an Inch and a half, or two Inches long, and of a proportionable bigne&s;s, which are black as Jett, &s;mooth as Gla&s;s, and their &s;mall end &s;harp as a Thorn; they are not &s;trait but bend|ing. The&s;e Teeth we often pre&s;erve. Some wear them in their Tobacco pouches to pick their Pipes. Others pre&s;erve them for Tooth-Pickers, e&s;pecially &s;uch as were troubled with the Toothach; for by report they will expel that pain, tho' I cannot ju|&s;tifie it of my own Knowledge. The backs of the&s;e Spiders are covered with a dark yellowi&s;h Down, as &s;oft as Velvet. Some &s;ay the&s;e Spiders are vene|mous; others not; whether is true I cannot deter|mine.</P>
<P>Tho' this Country be &s;o often over-flown with Water; yet it &s;warms with Ants, of &s;everal &s;orts; <HI>viz.</HI> great, &s;mall, black, yellow, &amp;c.

The&s;e Creatures have Ne&s;ts on great Trees, placed on the Body be|tween the Limbs: &s;ome of their Ne&s;ts are as big as a Hog&s;head; this is their Winter Habitation; for in the wet Sea&s;on they all repair to the&s;e their Cities:

The&s;e Companies were &s;o great, that they would be two or three hours in pa&s;&s;ing by, though they went very fa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Fowls of this Country are Humming Birds, Black Birds, Turtle Doves, Pigeons, Parrots, Para|kites, Quames, Corre&s;oes, Turkies, Carrion Crows, Subtle Jacks, Bill Birds, Cockrecoes, &amp;c. The Hum|ming Bird is a pretty little feather'd Creature, no bigger than a great over-grown Wa&s;p, with a black Bill no bigger than a &s;mall Needle, and his Legs and
<PB N="66" REF="263">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> Feet in proportion to his body. This Creature does not wave his Wings like other Birds when it flies, but keeps them in a continued quick motion like Bees or other Infects, and like them makes a con|tinual humming Noi&s;e as it flies. It is very quick in motion, and haunts about Flowers and Fruit, like a Bee gathering Hony, making many near addre&s;&s;es to its delightful Objects, by vi&s;iting them on all &s;ides, and yet &s;till keeps in motion, &s;ometimes on one &s;ide, &s;ometime on the other; as often rebounding a foot or two back on a &s;udden, and as quickly re|turns again, keeping thus about one Flower five or &s;ix minutes, or more. There are two or three &s;orts of them, &s;ome bigger than others, but all very &s;mall, neither are they coloured alike; the large&s;t are of a blacki&s;h colour.</P>
<P>The Black Bird is &s;omewhat bigger than ours in <HI>England;</HI> it has a longer Tail, but like them in Co|lour: They are &s;ometimes called Chattering Crows, becau&s;e they chatter like a Magpy.</P>
<P>There are three &s;orts of Turtle Doves <HI>(viz.)</HI> white bre&s;ted Doves, dun coloured Doves, and ground Doves. The white brea&s;ts are the bigge&s;t; they are of a blewi&s;h gray Colour with white Brea&s;ts; the&s;e are fine, round and plump, and almo&s;t as big as a Pigeon. The next &s;ort are all over of a dun, le&s;&s;er than the former, and not &s;o round. The ground Dove much bigger than a Sky-Lark, of a dull grey, very round and plump, and commonly runs in pairs on the ground, and probably thence have their name. The other two &s;orts flie in pairs, and feed on Berries, which they commonly gather them&s;elves from the Trees where they grow; and all threes &s;orts are very good Meat.</P>
<P>Pigeons are not very common here; they are le&s;s than our Wood Que&s;ts, and as good food.</P>
<P>The Quam is as big as an ordinary Hen Turkey, of a blacki&s;h dun Colour; its Bill like a Turkeys;
<PB N="67" REF="264">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> it flies about among the Woods; feeds on Berries, and is very good meat.</P>
<P>The Corre&s;o is a larger Fowl that the Quam: The Cock is black, the Hen is of a dark brown. The Cock has a Crown of black Feathers on his Head, and appears very &s;tately. The&s;e live al&s;o on Berries, and are very good to eat; but their Bones are &s;aid to be poi&s;onous; therefore we do either burn or bury them, or throw them into the Water for fear our Dogs &s;hould eat them.</P>
<P>Carrion Crows are blacki&s;h Fowls about the big|ne&s;s of Ravens; they have bald Heads, and redi&s;h bald Necks like Turkeys; and therefore by Strangers that come newly from <HI>Europe,</HI> are often mi&s;taken for &s;uch. The&s;e live wholly on fle&s;h, (and are there|fore called Carrion Crows:) There are great num|bers of them; They are heavy, dull Creatures, and by their perching long at one place they &s;eem to be very lazy: yet they are quick enough to find out their Prey; for when we hunt in the Woods or Sa|vannahs, as &s;oon as we have killed a Bea&s;t, they will immediately flock about us from all parts, and in le&s;s than an hours time there will be two or three hundred, though at fir&s;t there was not one to be &s;een. I have &s;ometimes admired from whence &s;o many came &s;o &s;uddenly; for we never &s;ee above two or three at a place, before they come to fea&s;t on a Car|ka&s;s.</P>
<P>Some of the Carrion Crows are all over white, but their Feathers look as if they were &s;ullied: They have bald Heads and Necks like the re&s;t; they are of the &s;ame bigne&s;s and make; without any diffe|rence but in Colour; and we never &s;ee above one or two of the&s;e white ones at a time; and 'tis &s;eldom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l&s;o that we &s;ee a great number of the black ones, but we &s;ee one white one among&s;t them.</P>

I have &s;een of the King Carrion Crows, but could not perceive them to be bigger than the re&s;t; neither were the black ones, their Companions, &s;o unmannerly as to let them eat without Company; they are very vo|racious, and will di&s;patch a Carca&s;s in a Trice: For that rea&s;on the Spaniards never kill them, but fine any one that &s;hall: And I think there is al&s;o an Act in <HI>Jamaica</HI> that prohibits their de&s;truction; and the Logwood-Cutters, tho' under no &s;uch obligation, yet are &s;o zealou&s;ly &s;uper&s;titious, that none will hurt them for fear of receiving &s;ome damage after|wards.</P>
<P>Subtle Jacks are Birds as big as Pidgeons; they are mo&s;tly blacki&s;h; the tips of their Wing Feathers are yellowi&s;h, as are al&s;o their Bills. They have a pe|culiar and wonderful cunning way of building dif|ferent from any others: Their Ne&s;ts hang down from the boughs of lofty Trees, who&s;e Bodies are clean without limbs for a con&s;iderable height: The branches to which they fa&s;ten them, are tho&s;e that &s;pread farthe&s;t out from the body; and the very ex|tremities of tho&s;e boughs are only u&s;ed by them. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Trees that grow &s;ingle by them&s;elves at &s;ome di|&s;tance from others, they build clear round; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> they joyn to others, they make choice of &s;uch on|ly as are bordering upon a Savannah, Pond or Creek, and hang down tho&s;e Ne&s;ts from tho&s;e limbs that &s;pread over their Savannahs, &amp;c. neglecting &s;uch as are near other Trees: Their Ne&s;ts hang down two or three foot from the twigs to which they are

The Thread that fa&s;tens the Ne&s;t to the twig is made of long Gra&s;s (as is al&s;o the Ne&s;t it &s;elf) very ingeniou&s;ly twi&s;ted together: It is but &s;mall at the twig; but near the Ne&s;t grows thicker. The Ne&s;t has a hole in the &s;ide for the Bird to enter at, and 'tis very pretty to &s;ee twenty or thirty of them hanging round a Tree. They are all called by the Engli&s;h <HI>Subtle Jacks,</HI> becau&s;e of this uncommon way of building.</P>
<P>There are two or three &s;orts of Bill-Birds, &s;o called by the Engli&s;h, becau&s;e their Bills are almo&s;t as big as them&s;elves. The large&s;t I ever &s;aw are about the &s;ize of Engli&s;h Wood-peckers, and much like them: There are others of a &s;maller &s;ort; but they are not often met with, and I never &s;aw many of them.</P>
<P>Cockrecoes are &s;hort winged Birds, coloured like Partridge, but &s;omewhat le&s;&s;er; neither are they &s;o plump and round. They have long Legs, delight|ing to run on the Ground among Woods in &s;wam|py Places or near Creeks. They make a loud Noi&s;e Mornings and Evenings, and An&s;wer one ano|ther very prettily; and they are extraordinary &s;weet Meat.</P>
<P>The Water-Fowls are Duck and Mallard; Cur|lews, Herons, Crabcatchers, Pelicans, Cormorants, Fi&s;hing-Hawks, Men-of-War-Birds, Boobies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are three &s;orts of Ducks, <HI>viz.</HI> The Mu&s;|covy, the Whi&s;tling and the common Duck. Mu&s;|covy Ducks are le&s;s than ours, but otherwi&s;e exactly alike. They perch on old dry Trees, or &s;uch as have no leaves on them, and &s;eldom light on the Ground but to feed. Whi&s;tling Ducks are &s;ome|what le&s;s than our Common Duck, but not differ|ing from them in &s;hape or Colour: In flying, their Wings make a pretty &s;ort of loud whi&s;tling Noi&s;e.

<P>Here are two &s;orts of Curlews different in bigne&s;s and colour; the greater are as big as Turkeys, with long Legs and long crooked Bills, like a Snipes, in length and bigne&s;s proportionable to the Bulk of their Bodies: They are of a dark colour; their Wings black and white; their Fle&s;h black, but very &s;weet and whole&s;om: They are call'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> double Curlews, becau&s;e they are twice as big as the other &s;ort.</P>
<P>The &s;mall Curlews are of a du&s;ky brown, with long Legs and Bills like the former: their Fle&s;h is mo&s;t e&s;teemed as being the &s;weete&s;t.</P>
<P>Herons are like ours in <HI>England</HI> in bigne&s;s, &s;hape and colour.</P>
<P>Crabcatchers are &s;haped and coloured like Herons, but they are &s;maller: They feed on &s;mall Crabs no bigger than ones Tumb, of which there is great plenty.</P>
<P>Pelicans are large flat-footed Fowls, almo&s;t as big as Gee&s;e, and their Feathers in colour like them: they have &s;hort Legs, long Necks, and their Bills are about two Inches broad and 17 or 18 long; the fore part of their Necks or Brea&s;ts is bare, and covered with a &s;oft, &s;mooth, yet loo&s;e Skin, like that about the Necks of Turkies: This Skin is of the colour of their Feathers, mixt with a dark and light grey, &s;o axactly interwoven that it appears very beautiful. They are a very heavy Bird, and &s;eldom fly far, or very high from the Water: They com|monly &s;it on Rocks at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;hore, where they may look about them. They &s;eem to be very melancholy Fowls, by their perching all alone: they &s;it as if they were &s;leeping, holding their Heads upright, and re&s;ting the ends of their

<P>Cormorants are ju&s;t like young Ducks in &s;hape, having &s;uch Feet and Bills: They are black with white Brea&s;ts, and live on &s;mall Fi&s;h which they take near the &s;hore, or on Worms which they get out of the Mud at low Water. They ta&s;te very fi&s;hy, yet are indifferent good Meat, they being ve|ry fat.</P>
<P>Fi&s;hing Hawks are like our &s;malle&s;t &s;ort of Hawks in colour and &s;hape, with &s;uch Bills and Talons; They perch upon &s;tumps of Trees or dry Limbs that hang over the Water about Creeks, Rivers or again&s;t the Sea: and upon &s;ight of any &s;mall Fi&s;h near them, they Skim along ju&s;t over them, and &s;natching up the Prey with their Talons, pre&s;ently ri&s;e again without touching the Water with their Wings. They don't &s;wallow the Fi&s;h whole as all other Fi&s;hing Fowls, that ever I &s;aw do, but tear it with their Bills and eat it Piece-Meal.</P>
<P>The Lagunes, Creeks and Rivers are plentifully &s;tored with great variety of Fi&s;h <HI>(viz.)</HI> Mullets, Snooks, Tenpounders, Tarpoms, Cavallies, Parri|cootas, Gar-fi&s;h, Stingrays, Spani&s;h Mackril, with many others.</P>
<P>Tenpounders are &s;haped like Mullets, but are &s;o full of very &s;mall &s;tiff Bones, intermixt with the Fle&s;h, that you can hardly eat them.</P>
<P>Parricootas are long Fi&s;h, with round Bodies like Mackril: They have very long Mouths and &s;harp Teeth; they are about 8 or 10 Inches round, and three Foot and half long. They commonly haunt in Lagunes among I&s;lands, or in the Sea near the &s;hore. They are a floating Fi&s;h, and greedily take the Hook, and will &s;nap at Men too in the Water.

I know that in ma|ny Parts of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> &s;ome have been injured by eating them, and that at different Sea&s;ons of the Year; therefore Seamen commonly ta&s;te the Li|ver before they venture any further; and if that has a biting ta&s;te like Pepper, they e&s;teem the fi&s;h un|whol&s;om, but if not, they eat it: and yet I have found even this Rule fail too. I judge the Head and the Parts near it, to be chiefly venomous.</P>
<P>Gar-fi&s;h are round, but neither &s;o big nor long as the former; but what is more peculiar, they have long bony Snouts, like the Sword-fi&s;h, only as the Sword-fi&s;hes Snout is flat, and indented like a Saw on each &s;ide; &s;o on the contrary the&s;e have their Snouts like a Spear, round, &s;mooth and &s;harp at the end, and about a foot long.

<P>Spani&s;h Mackril are in &s;hape and colour like our Mackril, but larger: They are three Foot or three and half long, and nine or ten Inches about, and they al&s;o are generally e&s;teemed very excellent Fi&s;h.</P>

The Ra&s;pray has a rough knotty Skin wherewith Ra&s;ps are made: the Skins of the large&s;t are &s;o rough, that the Spaniards in &s;ome Places grate their Ca&s;&s;avy with them, which is a Root very common all over the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> and of which the Spaniards and Engli&s;h frequently make their Bread; but the faire&s;t Skins are u&s;ed to cover Surgeons In&s;trument Ca&s;es, and other &s;uch fine Things; but of late they are counterfeited. I have been told that in <HI>Turkey</HI> A&s;&s;es Skins are &s;tamped with &s;mall hard Seeds, which gives them Impre&s;&s;ions like Ra&s;pray.</P>
<P>The Whipray differs from the other two &s;orts, having a &s;mall, but longer Tail, and ending with a Knob, &s;haped like a Harpoon. All the&s;e three &s;orts are much about a Foot and half broad. There is yet another &s;ort of the&s;e flat Fi&s;h of the Whipray kind, but of a prodigious bigne&s;s; <HI>viz.</HI> three or four Yards &s;quare, and their Tails as long: the&s;e we call Sea-Devils; they are very &s;trong Fi&s;h, and are &s;ometimes Game&s;om; but they make an odd Figure when they leap out of the Water, tumbling over and over.</P>
<P>Neither are Turtle and Manatee wanting in this Lagune. Here are &s;ome Hawks-bill-Turtle, but the green Turtle is mo&s;t plentiful. They are of a middle &s;ize; yet here was once a very large one taken, as I have mentioned in my <HI>Voyages round the World.</HI></P>
<P>Here are abundance of Manatee, which are both large and &s;weet.</P>

<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> Alligators are al&s;o in great numbers in all the Creeks, Rivers and Lagunes in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy;</HI> and I think that no part of the Univer&s;e is better &s;tock'd with them.</P>
<P>The Alligator is a Creature &s;o well known every where, that I &s;hould not de&s;cribe it, were it not to give an Account of the difference between it and the Crocodile; for they re&s;emble each other &s;o nearly in their &s;hape and bulk, as al&s;o in their Natures, that they are generally mi&s;taken for the &s;ame Species; only the one &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Male, the other the Female: Whether they are &s;o or not, the World may judge by the following Ob&s;ervations. As to their Bulk and length, I never &s;aw any &s;o large as &s;ome I have heard and read of; but accor|ding to my be&s;t Judgment, though I have &s;een Thou&s;ands, I never met with any above &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen Foot long, and as thick as a large Colt. He his &s;haped like a Lizard, of a dark brown colour, with a large head and very long Jaws, with great &s;trong Teeth, e&s;pecially two of a Remarkable Length, that grow out of, and at the very end of the under Jaw in the &s;malle&s;t part, on each &s;ide one; there are two holes in the upper Jaw to receive the&s;e, otherways he could not &s;hut his Mouth. It has 4 &s;hort Legs and Broad Claws, with a long Tail. The Head, Back and Tail is fenced with pretty hard Scales, joyned together with a very thick tough Skin: Over its Eyes there are two hard &s;cally Knobs, as big as a Mans Fi&s;t, and from the Head to the Tail, along the Ridge of his Back 'tis full of &s;uch knotty hard Scales, not like Fi&s;h-Scales, which are loo&s;e, but &s;o united to the Skin, that it is all one with it, and can't be taken a&s;under, but with a &s;harp Knife. From the Ridge of the Back down on the Ribs towards the Belly, (which is of a du&s;ky yellow colour like a Frog) there are many of the&s;e Scales, but not &s;o &s;ub&s;tantial nor &s;o thick placed as the other.
<PB N="75" REF="272">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> The&s;e Scales are no hindrance to him in turning; for he will turn very quick, con&s;idering his length. When he goes on Land his Tail drags on the Ground.</P>
<P>The Fle&s;h &s;mells very &s;trong of Mu&s;k; e&s;pecially four Kernels or Cods that are always found about them, two of which grow in the Groin, near each Thigh; the other two at the Brea&s;t, one under each Fore-leg, and about the bigne&s;s of a Pullets Egg; therefore when we kill an Alligator, we take out the&s;e, and having dried them wear them in our Hats for a perfume. The Fle&s;h is &s;eldom eaten but in ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, becau&s;e of it &s;trong &s;cent.</P>
<P>Now the Crocodile hath none of the&s;e Kernels, neither doth his Fle&s;h ta&s;te at all Mu&s;ky, therefore e&s;teemed better Food. He is of a yellow colour, neither hath he &s;uch long Teeth in his under Jaw. The Crocodile's Legs al&s;o are longer, and when it runs on Land, it bears its Tail above the Ground, and turns up the tip of it in a round bow, and the Knots on the back are much thicker, higher and firmer than tho&s;e of the Alligator; and differ al&s;o as to the Places where they are found. For in &s;ome Parts, as here in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> are abundance of Alligators, where yet I never &s;aw nor heard of any Crocodiles. At the I&s;le <HI>Grand Caymanes,</HI> there are Crocodiles, but no Alligators. At <HI>Pines</HI> by <HI>Cuba,</HI> there are abundance of Crocodiles, but I cannot &s;ay there are no Alligators, tho' I never &s;aw any there. Both Kinds are called <HI>Caymanes,</HI> by the Spaniards; therefore probably they may reckon them for the &s;ame. And I know of no other difference, for they both lay Eggs alike, which are not di&s;tingui&s;hable to the Eye: They are as big as a Goo&s;e-Egg, but much longer, and good Meat; yet the Alligators Eggs ta&s;te very mu&s;ky: They prey both alike in either Element,
<PB N="76" REF="273">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> for they love Fle&s;h as well as Fi&s;h, and will live in either fre&s;h or &s;alt Water. Be&s;ide the&s;e Creatures, I know none that can live any where, or upon any &s;ort of Food, like them. 'Tis reported, that they love Dogs Fle&s;h better than any other Fle&s;h what|&s;oever. This I have &s;een with my own Eyes, that our Dogs were &s;o much afraid of them, that they would not very willingly drink at any great River or Creek where tho&s;e Creatures might lurk and hide them&s;elves, unle&s;s they were (through Nece&s;&s;ity) con&s;trained to it; and then they would &s;tand five or &s;ix Foot from the brink of the Creek or River, and bark a con&s;iderable time before they would Adventure nearer; and then even at the &s;ight of their own Shadows in the Water, they would again retire to the Place from whence they came, and bark vehemently a long time; &s;o that in the dry Sea&s;on, when there was no fre&s;h Water but in Ponds and Creeks, we u&s;ed to fetch it our &s;elves and give it our Dogs; and many times in our Hunting, when we came to a large Creek that we were to pa&s;s through, our Dogs would not follow us; &s;o that we often took them in our Arms, and carried them over.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the fore-mentioned difference between the Alligator and Crocodile; the latter is accounted more fierce and daring then the Alligator: There|fore when we go to the I&s;les of <HI>Pines</HI> or <HI>Grand Caymanes</HI> to hunt, we are often mole&s;ted by them, e&s;pecially in the Night. But in the Bay of <HI>Cam|peachy,</HI> where there are only Alligators, I did never know any Mi&s;chief done by them, except by accident Men run them&s;elves into their Jaws. I remember one In&s;tance of this Nature, which is as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="274">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> In the very height of the dry time &s;even or eight Men (Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h) went to a place called <HI>Pies Pond,</HI> on <HI>Beef-I&s;land,</HI> to hunt. This Pond was never dry, &s;o that the Cattle drew hither in &s;warms, but after two or three days hunting they were &s;hy, and would not come to the Pond till Night, and then if an Army of Men had lain to oppo&s;e them, they would not have been debarr'd of Water. The Hunters knowing their Cu&s;tom, lay &s;till all Day, and in the Night vi&s;ited this Pond, and killed as many Beefs as they could. This Trade they had driven a Week, and made great profit. At length an Iri&s;h-man going to the Pond in the Night, &s;tumbled over an Alligator that lay in the Path: The Alligator &s;eized him by the Knee; at which the Man cries out, <HI>Help! help!</HI> His Con&s;orts not know|ing what the matter was, ran all away from their Huts, &s;uppo&s;ing that he was fallen into the Clutches of &s;ome <HI>Spaniards,</HI> of whom they were afraid every dry Sea&s;on. But poor <HI>Daniel</HI> not finding any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, waited till the Bea&s;t opened his Jaw to take better hold; becau&s;e it is u&s;ual for the Alligator to do &s;o; and then &s;natch'd away his Knee, and &s;lipt the But-end of his Gun in the room of it, which the Alligator griped &s;o hard, that he pull'd it out of his Hand and &s;o went away. The Man being near a &s;mall Tree climb'd up out of his reach; and then cried out to his Con&s;orts to come and a&s;&s;i&s;t him; who being &s;till within Call, and watching to hear the I&s;&s;ue of the Ala|rum, made ha&s;te to him with Fire-brands in their Hands, and brought him away in their Arms to his Hut; for he was in a deplora|ble condition, and not able to &s;tand on his Feet, his Knee was &s;o torn with the Alligators Teeth.</P>
<P>His Gun was found the next day ten or twelve Paces from the place where he was &s;eized, with
<PB N="78" REF="275">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> two large Holes made in the But-end of it, one on each &s;ide, near an Inch deep; for I &s;aw the Gun afterwards.

<P>This Iri&s;h-man went afterwards to <HI>New-England,</HI> to be cured, in a Ship belonging to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and nine or ten Months after returned to the Bay again, being recovered of his Wound, but went limping ever after.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Logwood-Cutters (as I &s;aid before) inhabit the Creeks of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Lagunes, in &s;mall Campanies, building their Huts clo&s;e by the Creeks &s;ides for the benefit of the Sea-Breezes, as near the Logwood Groves as they can, removing often to be near their Bu&s;ine&s;s: yet when they are &s;ettled in a good open Place, they chu&s;e rather to go half a Mile in their Canoas to work, than lo&s;e that convenience. Tho' they build their Huts but &s;lightly, yet they take care to thatch them very well with Palm or Palmeto Leaves, to prevent the Rains, which are there very violent, from &s;oaking in.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="277">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> For their Bedding they rai&s;e a Barbecue, or wooden Frame 3 Foot and a half above Ground on one &s;ide of the Hou&s;e; and &s;tick up four Stakes, at each corner one, to fa&s;ten their Pavilions; out of which here is no &s;leeping for Mo&s;kitoes.</P>
<P>Another Frame they rai&s;e covered with Earth for a Hearth to dre&s;s their Victuals: and a third to &s;it at when they eat it.</P>
<P>During the wet Sea&s;on, the Land where the Logwood grows is &s;o overflow'd, that they &s;tep from their Beds into the Water perhaps two Foot deep, and continue &s;tanding in the wet all Day, till they go to. Bed again; but neverthele&s;s account it the be&s;t Sea&s;on in the Year for doing a good days La|bour in.</P>
<P>Some fell the Trees, others &s;aw and cut them into convenient Logs, and one chips off the Sap, and he is commonly a principal Man; and when a Tree is &s;o thick, that after it has lodg'd, it remains &s;till too great a Burthen for one Man, we blow it up with Gun-powder.</P>
<P>The Logwood-Cutters are generally &s;turdy &s;trong Fellows, and will carry Burthens of three or four hundred Weight; but every Man is left to his choice to carry what he plea&s;eth, and commonly they agree very well about it: For they are contented to la|bour very hard.</P>
<P>But when Ships come from <HI>Jamaica</HI> with Rum and Sugar, they are too apt to mi&s;-pend both their Time and Money. If the Commanders of the&s;e Ships are Free, and treat all that come the fir&s;t Day with Punch, they will be much re&s;pected, and every Man will pay hone&s;tly for what he drinks afterwards; but if he be niggardly, they will pay him with their wor&s;t Wood, and commonly they have a &s;tock of &s;uch lay'd by for that purpo&s;e; nay, they will cheat them with hollow Wood fill'd with dirt in the middle and both ends plugg'd up
<PB N="81" REF="278">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> with a piece of the &s;ame drove in hard, and then &s;awed off &s;o neatly, that it's hard to find out the deceit; but if any Man come to purcha&s;e with Bills payable at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> they will be &s;ure to give him the be&s;t Wood.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places, e&s;pecially in the We&s;t Creek of the We&s;t Lagune, they go a hunting every <HI>Saturday</HI> to provide them&s;elves with Beef for the Week fol|lowing.</P>
<P>The Cattle in this Country are large and fat in <HI>February, March,</HI> and <HI>April:</HI> At other times of the Year they are &s;le&s;hy, but not fat, yet &s;weet enough. When they have kill'd a Beef, they cut it into four Quarters, and taking out all the Bones, each Man makes a hole in the middle of his Quarter, ju&s;t big enough for his Head to go through, then puts it on like a Frock, and trudgeth home; and if he chances to tire, he cuts off &s;ome of it, and flings it away.</P>
<P>It is a diver&s;ion plea&s;ant enough, though not without &s;ome danger, to hunt in a Canoa; for then the Cattle having no other feeding Places than the &s;ides of the Savannahs, which are &s;omewhat higher Ground than the middle, they are forced &s;ometimes to &s;wim; &s;o that we ea&s;ily come to &s;hoot them, when they are thus in the Water.</P>
<P>The Bea&s;t, when &s;he is &s;o hard pur&s;ued that &s;he cannot e&s;cape, turns about and comes full tilt at the Canoa, and &s;triking her Head again&s;t the Prow, drives her back 20 or 30 Paces; then &s;he &s;campers away again: But if &s;he has received a wound, &s;he commonly pur&s;ues us till &s;he is knock'd down. Our chiefe&s;t care is to keep the head of the Canoa to|wards her; for if &s;he &s;hould &s;trike again&s;t the broad &s;ide, it would indanger over-&s;etting it, and con&s;equently wetting our Arms and Ammunition. Be&s;ides, the Savannahs at this time &s;warm with Alligators, and therefore are the more dangerous on that account.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="279">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> The&s;e Creatures in the wet Sea&s;on for&s;ake the Rivers, and inhabit the Drownd-Savannahs to meet with Purcha&s;e, and no Fle&s;h comes ami&s;s to them, whether alive or dead. Their chief Sub&s;i&s;tence then is on young Cattle, or &s;uch Carka&s;&s;es as we leave behind us, which in the Dry Sea&s;on feed the Carrion-Crows; but now are a Prey to the Alligators. They remain here till the Water drains off from the Land; and then confine them&s;elves to the Stagnant Ponds; and when they are dry, they ramble away to &s;ome Creek or River.</P>
<P>The Alligators in this <HI>Bay</HI> are not &s;o fierce as they are reported to be in other Places; for I never knew them pur&s;ue any Man, although we do frequently meet them; nay, they will flee from us: and I have drank out of a Pond in the dry time, that hath been full of them, and the Water not deep enough to cover their backs, and the compa&s;s of the Pond &s;o &s;mall that I could get no Water, but by coming within two Yards of the Alligators No&s;e; they lying with their Heads towards mine as I was drink|ing, and looking on me all the while. Neither did I ever hear of any bit in the Water by them, tho' probably &s;hould a Man happen in their way, they would &s;eize upon him.</P>
<P>Having thus given &s;ome De&s;cription of the Coun|try, I &s;hall next give an Account of my Living with the Logwood-Men, and of &s;everal Occurrences that happened during my &s;tay here.</P>
<P>Tho' I was a Stranger to their Employment and manner of Living, as being known but to tho&s;e few only of whom we bought our Wood, in my for|mer Voyage hither; yet that little Acquaintance I then got, incouraged me to vi&s;it them after my &s;e|cond arrival here; being in hopes to &s;trike in to work with them. There were &s;ix in Company, who had a Hundred Tuns ready cut, log'd and chip'd, but not brought to the Creeks &s;ide, and they
<PB N="83" REF="280">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> expected a Ship from <HI>New-England</HI> in a Month or two, to fetch it away.</P>
<P>When I came hither, they were beginning to bring it to the Creek: And becau&s;e the Carriage is the harde&s;t Work, they hired me to help them at the rate of a Tun of Wood <HI>per</HI> Month; promi&s;ing me that after his Carriage was over, I &s;hould &s;trike in to work with them, for they were all obliged in Bonds to procure this 100 Tuns jointly together, but for no more.</P>
<P>This Wood lay all in the Circumference of 5 or 600 Yards, and about 300 from the Creek-&s;ide in the middle of a very thick Wood, unpa&s;&s;able with Burthens. The fir&s;t thing we did was to bring it all to one Place in the middle, and from thence we cut a very large Path to carry it to the Creeks &s;ide. We laboured hard at this Work 5 Days in the Week; and on Saturdays went into the Savannahs and kil|led Beeves.</P>
<P>When we killed a Beef, if there were more than four of us, the Overplus went to &s;eek fre&s;h Game, whil&s;t the re&s;t dre&s;s'd it.</P>
<P>I went out the fir&s;t Sunday and complyed very well with my Ma&s;ter's Orders, which was only to help drive the Cattle out of the Savannahs into the Woods, where two or three Men lay to &s;hoot them: And having kill'd our Game, we marched Home with our Burthens. The next Saturdy after, I went with a de&s;ign to kill a Beef my &s;elf, thinking it more honour to try my own Skill in Shooting, than only to drive the Game for others to &s;hoot at. We w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">t now to a Place called the <HI>Upper Savannah,</HI> go|ing four Miles in our Canoas, and then landing, walk'd one Mile thro' the Woods, before we came into the Savannah, and marched about two Miles in it, before we came up with any Game. Here I gave my Com|panions the &s;lip, and wandred &s;o far into the Woods that I lo&s;t my &s;elf; neither could I find the
<PB N="84" REF="281">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> way into the open Savannah, but in&s;tead of that ran directly from it, through &s;mall &s;pots of Sa|vannahs and Skirts of Woods. This was &s;ometime in <HI>May,</HI> and it was between ten a Clock and one when I began to find that I was (as we called it, I &s;uppo&s;e from the Spaniards) <HI>Morooned,</HI> or Lo&s;t, and quite out of the Hearing of my Comrades Guns. I was &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd at this; but however, I knew I &s;hould find my way out, as &s;oon as the Sun was a little lower. So I &s;at down to re&s;t my &s;elf; re&s;olving however to run no farther out of my way; for the Sun being &s;o near the Zenith, I could not di&s;tingui&s;h how to direct my Cour&s;e. Being weary and almo&s;t faint for want of Water, I was forced to have recour&s;e to the Wild-Pines, and was by them &s;upplied, or el&s;e I mu&s;t have peri&s;hed with Thir&s;t. About three a Clock I went due North, as near as I could judge, for the Savannah lay Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and I was on the South &s;ide of it.</P>
<P>At Sun-&s;et I got into the clear open Savannah, being about two Leagues wide in mo&s;t Places, but how long I know not. It is well &s;tored with Bul|locks, but by frequent hunting they grow &s;hy, and remove farther up into the Country. Here I found my &s;elf four or five Mile to the We&s;t of the Place where I &s;tragled from my Companions. I made homewards with all the &s;peed I could, but being overtaken by the Night, I lay down on the Gra&s;s a good di&s;tance from the Woods, for the be|nefit of the Wind, to keep the Mu&s;kitoes from me; but in vain: for in le&s;s than an Hours time I was &s;o per&s;ecuted, that though I endeavoured to keep them off by Fanning my &s;elf with Boughs and &s;hifting my Quarters 3 or 4 times; yet &s;till they haunted me &s;o that I could get no &s;leep. At Day-break I got up and directed my Cour&s;e to the Creek where we landed, from which I was then about two Leagues. I did not &s;ee one Bea&s;t of any
<PB N="85" REF="282">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> &s;ort whatever in all the way; though the day before I &s;aw &s;everal Young Calves that could not follow their Dams, but even the&s;e were now gone away, to my great Vexation and Di&s;appointment, for I was very hungry. But about a Mile farther, I &s;pied ten or twelve Quams perching on the Boughs of a Cotton-Tree. The&s;e were not &s;hy, therefore I got well enough under them; and having a &s;ingle Bullet (but no &s;hot) about me, fired at one of them, but mi&s;s'd it, though I had before often kill'd them &s;o. Then I came up with, and fired at 5 or 6 Turkies, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s. So that I was forced to march forward &s;till in the Savannah, toward the Creek; and when I came to the Path that led to it through the Woods, I found (to my great Joy) a Hat &s;tuck upon a Pole: and when I came to the Creek I found another. The&s;e were &s;et up by my Con&s;orts, who were gone home in the Evening, as Signals that they would come and fetch me. There|fore I &s;at down and waited for them; for although I had not then above three Leagues home by Water, yet it would have been very difficult, if not impo&s;|&s;ible for me to have got thither over Land, by rea|&s;on of tho&s;e va&s;t unpa&s;&s;able Thickets abounding every where along the Creeks &s;ide; wherein I have known &s;ome puzzled for two or three days, and have not advanced half a Mile, though they la|boured extreamly every day. Neither was I di&s;ap|pointed of my hopes; for within half an Hour after my arrival at the Creek, my Con&s;orts came, bring|ing every Man his Bottle of Water, and his Gun, both to hunt for Game and to give me notice by Firing, that I might here them; for I have known &s;everal Men lo&s;t in the like manner, and never heard of afterwards.</P>
<P>Such an Accident befel one Captain <HI>Hall</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> who came hither in a <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Ship, to take in Logwood, and was fraighted by two Scotch|men,

One Morning the Captain de&s;igning to hunt, took five of his Men, with his Mate, as al&s;o his Merchant Mr. <HI>Cane</HI> along with him. They Land|ed at the Ea&s;t end of the I&s;land, which is low <HI>Man|grove-land;</HI> the Savannah is a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the Sea, and therefore trouble&s;om to get to it. However, unle&s;s they would row four or five Leagues farther, they could not find a more con|venient place; be&s;ide, they doubted not of Mr. <HI>Canes</HI> &s;kill to conduct them. After they had followed him a Mile or two into the Woods, the Captain &s;eeing him to make a Halt (as being in &s;ome doubt) to con&s;ider of the way, told him in deri&s;ion, that he was but a &s;orry Wood&s;man, and that he would &s;wing him but twice round, and he &s;hould not gue&s;s the way out again; and &s;aying no more to him went forwards, and bid his Seamen follow him, which they did accordingly. Mr. <HI>Cane,</HI> after he had recollected him&s;elf, &s;truck off another way, and de&s;ired them to go with him: But in&s;tead of that, they were all for following the Captain. In a &s;hort time Mr. <HI>Cane</HI> got out of the Woods into the Sa|vannah, and there kill'd a good fat Cow, and quar|tering it, made it fit for Carriage, &s;uppo&s;ing the Captain and Crew would &s;oon be with him. But after waiting 3 or 4 hours, and firing his Gun &s;eve|ral times, without hearing any An&s;wer, took up his Burden and returned towards the Sea-&s;ide; and upon giving a Signal a Boat came and brought him aboard. In the Mean time the Captain and his Men after 4 or 5 Hours ranging the Woods, began to grow tired, and then his Mate happily tru&s;ting more to his own Judgment, left him and the four Seamen, and about
<PB N="87" REF="284">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> four or five a Clock being almo&s;t &s;pent with Thir&s;t, got out of the Woods to the Sea &s;hore, and as weak as he was, fired his Gun for the Boat to fetch him, which was immediately done.</P>
<P>When he came Aboard he gave an Account where|about, and in what a condition he left the Captain and his Men; but it being then too late to &s;eek him, the next Morning very early Mr. <HI>Cane</HI> and two Sea|men taking Directions from the Mate (who was &s;o fatigued that he could not &s;tir) where he had left the Captain, went a&s;hore, and at length came with|in call of him, and at la&s;t found him laid down in a Thicket, having ju&s;t &s;en&s;e to call out &s;ometimes, but not &s;trength enough to &s;tand; &s;o they were forced to carry him to the Sea-&s;ide. When they had a little refre&s;hed him with Brandy and Water, he told them how his Company had fainted for Thir&s;t, and drop'd down one after another, though he &s;till incouraged them to be chearful and re&s;t them&s;elves a while, till he got &s;ome &s;upplies of Water for them; that they were very patient, and that two of his Men held out till five a Clock in the Afternoon, and then they fainted al&s;o; but he him|&s;elf proceeded in que&s;t of his way till night; and then fell down in the place where they then found him.</P>
<P>The two Seamen carried the Captain Aboard, while Mr. <HI>Cane</HI> &s;carched about for the re&s;t, but to no purpo&s;e; for he returned without them, and could never hear of them afterwards.</P>
<P>This was a warning to me never to &s;traggle from my Con&s;orts in our Hunting. But to proceed.</P>
<P>When my Months Service was up, in which time we brought down all the Wood to the Creek &s;ide, I was pre&s;ently pay'd my Tun of Logwood; with which, and &s;ome more that I borrow'd, I bought a little Provi&s;ion, and was afterwards entertained as a
<PB N="88" REF="285">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> Companion at work with &s;ome of my former Ma&s;ters; for they pre&s;ently broke up Con&s;ort-&s;hips, letting the Wood lye till either Mr. <HI>We&s;t</HI> came to fetch it, according to his Contract, or el&s;e till they &s;hould otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;e of it. Some of them immediately went to <HI>Beef-I&s;land</HI> to kill Bullocks for their Hides, which they pre&s;erve by pegging them out very tite on the Ground. Fir&s;t they turn the fle&s;hy &s;ide, and after the hair upwards, letting them lye &s;o till they are very dry. 32 &s;trong Pegs as big as a Man's Arm, are required to &s;tretch the Hide as it ought to be. When they are dry they fold them in the middle from Head to Tail, with the Hair outward; and then hang them cro&s;s a &s;trong pole &s;o high that the ends may not touch the Ground, 40 or 50, one upon another, and once in 3 Weeks or a Month they beat them with great Sticks, to &s;trike off the Worms that breed in the Hair, and eat it off, which &s;poils the Hide. When they are to be &s;hip'd off, they &s;oak them in &s;alt Water to kill the remaining Worms; and while they are yet wet they fold them in 4 folds, and afterwards &s;pread them abroad again to dry. When they are fully dry, they fold them up again, and &s;o &s;end them Aboard. I was yet a Stranger to this Work, therefore remained with 3 of the old Crew to cut more Logwood. My Con&s;orts were all three Scotch-men; one of them named <HI>Price Morrice</HI> had lived there &s;ome Years, and was Ma&s;ter of a pretty large Periago; for without &s;ome &s;ort of Boat, here is no &s;tirring from one place to another. The other two were young Men that had been bred Merchants, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Duncam Campbell;</HI> and Mr. <HI>George</HI>&mdash;The&s;e two not liking either the Place or Employ|ment, waited an opportunity of going away by the fir&s;t Ship that came hither to take in Logwood. Ac|cordingly not long after the above-mentioned. Capt. <HI>Hall</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> came hither on that de&s;ign, and was
<PB N="89" REF="286">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> fraighted by them with 40 Tun. It was agreed that <HI>George</HI> &s;hould &s;tay behind to cut Logwood; but <HI>Campbell</HI> &s;hould go to <HI>New-England</HI> to &s;ell this Car|go, and bring back Flower, and &s;uch other Commo|dities that were proper to purcha&s;e Hides and Log|wood in the Bay. This retarded our bu&s;ine&s;s; for I did not find <HI>Price Morrice</HI> very intent at Work: for 'tis like he thought he had Logwood enough. And I have particularly ob&s;erved there, and in other Places, that &s;uch as had been well-bred, were gene|rally mo&s;t careful to improve their Time, and would be very indu&s;trious and frugal, when there was any probability of con&s;iderable Gain. But on the con|trary, &s;uch as had been inur'd to hard Labour, and got their Living by the &s;weat of their Brows, when they came to a plenty, would extravagantly &s;quander away their Time and Money in Drinking and mak|ing a Blu&s;ter.</P>
<P>To be &s;hort, I kept to my Work by my &s;elf, till I was hindred by a hard, red and angry Swelling like a Boyl, in my right Leg; &s;o painful that I was &s;carce able to &s;tand on it: but I was directed to roa&s;t and apply the Roots of White Lillies (of which here is great plenty, growing by the Creek &s;ides) to draw it to a head. This I did three or four Days, without any benefit. At la&s;t I perceived two White Specks in the middle of the Boil; and &s;queezing it, two &s;mall white Worms &s;purted out: I took them both up in my Hand, and perceived each of them to be inve&s;ted with three Rows of black, &s;hort, &s;tiff Hair, running clear round them; one Row near each end; the other in the middle; each Row di&s;tinct from other; and all very regular and uniform. The Worms were about the bigne&s;s of a Hens Quill, and about three fourths of an Inch long.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw Worms of this &s;ort breed in any Man's Fle&s;h. Indeed <HI>Guinea Worms</HI> are very frequent in &s;ome Places of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> e&s;pecially at <HI>Cura|&s;ao;</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="287">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> They breed as well in Whites as Negroes: And becau&s;e that I&s;land was formerly a Magazin of Ne|groes, while the Dutch drove that Trade with the Spaniards, and the Negroes were mo&s;t &s;ubject to them; 'twas therefore believed that other People took them by Infection from them. I rather judge that they are generated by drinking bad Water; and 'tis as likely that the Water of the other I&s;land of <HI>Aruba</HI> and <HI>Bonariry</HI> may produce the &s;ame Effects; for many of tho&s;e that went with me from thence to <HI>Virginia</HI> (mentioned in my former Volume) were troubled with them after our arrival there: parti|cularly I my &s;elf had one broke out in my Ancle, after I had been there five or &s;ix Months.</P>
<P>The&s;e Worms are no bigger than a large brown Thread, but (as I have heard) five or &s;ix Yards long; and if it breaks in drawing out, that part which re|mains in the Fle&s;h will putrifie, and be very painful, and indanger the Patients Life; or at lea&s;t the u&s;e of that Limb: and I have known &s;ome that have been &s;carified and cut &s;trangely, to take out the Worm. I was in great torment before it came out: my Leg and Ancle &s;well'd and look'd very red and angry; and I kept a Plai&s;ter, to it, to bring it to a Head. At la&s;t drawing off my Plai&s;ter out came about three Inches of the Worm; and my pain abated pre&s;ently. Till then I was Ignorant of my Malady; and the Gentlewoman, at who&s;e Hou&s;e I was, took it for a Nerve; but I knew enough what it was, and pre|&s;ently roll'd it up on a &s;mall Stick. After that I opened it every Morning and Evening, and &s;trained it out gently, about 2 Inches at a time, not with|out &s;ome pain, till at length I had got out about two Foot.</P>
<P>Riding with one Mr. <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> who was going to a Negro to have his Hor&s;e cured of a gall'd Back, I a&s;ked the Negro if he could undertake my Leg: and which he did readily; and in the mean
<PB N="91" REF="288">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> time I ob&s;erved his Method in curing the Hor&s;e; which was this. Fir&s;t he &s;trok'd the &s;ore Place, then applying to it a little rough Powder, which looked like Tobacco Leaves dryed and crumbled &s;mall, and mumbling &s;ome Words to him&s;elf, he blew upon the part three times, and waving his Hands as often over it, &s;aid, it would be well &s;peedily. His Fee for the Cure was a White Cock.</P>
<P>Then coming to me, and looking on the Worm in my Ancle, he promi&s;ed to cure it in three Days, de|manding al&s;o a White Cock for his pains, and u&s;ing exactly the &s;ame Method with me, as he did with the Hor&s;e. He bad me not open it in three Days; but I did not &s;tay &s;o long; for the next Morning the Cloath being rubb'd off, I unbound it, and found the Worm broken off, and the Hole quite healed up. I was afraid the remaining part would have given &s;ome trouble, but have not felt any pain there from that day to this.</P>
<P>To return. I told you how I was interrupted in following my Work, by the Worms breeding in my Leg. And to compleat my misfortune, pre&s;ently after we had the mo&s;t violent Storm, for above 24 Hours, that ever was known in the&s;e Parts. An Ac|count of which I &s;hall give more particularly in my <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e of Winds</HI> and &s;hall now only mention &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid, we were four of us in Com|pany at this Place cutting Logwood: and by this Storm were reduced to great Inconveniencies; for while that la&s;ted we could dre&s;s no Victuals, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> even now it was over, unle&s;s we had done it in the Canoa; for the highe&s;t Land near us was almo&s;t 3 Foot under Water: be&s;ides our Provi&s;ion too was mo&s;t of it &s;poiled, except the Beef and Pork, which was but little the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>We had a good Canoa large enough to carry us all; and &s;eeing it in vain to &s;tay here any longer, we
<PB N="92" REF="289">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> all embarked and rowed away to <HI>One-Bu&s;h-Key,</HI> about 4 Leagues from our Huts. There were 4 Ships riding here, when the Storm began: but at our arrival we found only one, and hoped to have got &s;ome Refre&s;h|ment from it, but found very cold entertainment: For we could neither get Bread nor Punch, nor &s;o much as a Dram of Rum, though we offered them Money for it. The Rea&s;on was, they were already over-charged with &s;uch as being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the Storm, had been forced to take Sanctuary with them: Seeing we could not be &s;upplied here, we a&s;ked which way the other three Ships were driven? they told us that Capt. <HI>Prout</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> was driven towards <HI>Tri&s;t,</HI> and 'twas probable he was carried out to Sea, unle&s;s he &s;truck on a Sand, called the <HI>Middle Ground;</HI> that Capt. <HI>Skinner</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> was driven towards <HI>Beef-I&s;land;</HI> and Captain <HI>Chand|ler</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> drove away towards <HI>Man-of-War Lagune.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Beef-I&s;land</HI> lies North from <HI>One-Bu&s;h-Key;</HI> but the other two Places lie a little on each &s;ide: One to the Ea&s;t; the other to the We&s;t. So away we went for <HI>Beef-I&s;land:</HI> and coming within a League of it, we &s;aw a Flag in the Woods, made fa&s;t to a Pole, and placed on the Top of a high Tree. And coming &s;till nearer, we at la&s;t &s;aw a Ship in the Woods, about 200 Yards from the Sea. We rowed directly towards her; and when we came to the Woods &s;ide, found a pretty clear Pa&s;|&s;age made by the Ship, through the Woods, the Trees being all broke down; and about three Foot Water Home to the Ship. We rowed in with our Canoa, and went aboard, and were kindly Enter|tained by the Seamen: but the Captain was gone Aboard Captain <HI>Prout,</HI> who &s;tuck fa&s;t on the middle Ground before-mentioned. Captain <HI>Prout</HI>'s Ship was afterwards got off again; but the Stumps of the Trees ran clear through the bottom of Captain

<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> <HI>Skinner</HI>'s, therefore there was no hope of &s;aving her. Here we got Victuals and Punch, and &s;tayed about two Hours, in which time the Captain came aboard and invited us to &s;tay all Night. But hearing &s;ome Guns fired in <HI>Man-of-War Lagune,</HI> we concluded that Captain <HI>Chandler</HI> was there, and wanted a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. Therefore we pre&s;ently rowed away thi|ther, for we could do no Service here: and before Night found him al&s;o &s;tuck fa&s;t on a Point of Sand. The Head of his Ketch was dry, and at the Stern, there was above 4 foot Water. Our coming was very &s;ea&s;onable to Captain <HI>Chandler,</HI> with whom we &s;tayed two Days: in which time we got out all his Goods, carried off his Anchor, &amp;c. and &s;o not being able as yet to do him more Service, we left him for the pre&s;ent, and went away to hunt at <HI>Beef-I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> were four Ve&s;&s;els riding before this Storm; one of them was driven off to Sea, and never heard of afterwards. Another was ca&s;t dry upon the &s;hore, where &s;he lay and was never got off again: But the third rode it out. Another was riding without the Bar of <HI>Tri&s;t,</HI> and &s;he put to Sea, and got to <HI>New-England;</HI> but much &s;hattered. About <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> days before this Storm began, a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, Commanded by Captain <HI>Vally,</HI> went hence, bound to <HI>Jamaica.</HI> This Ve&s;&s;el was given for lo&s;t by all the Logwood-Cutters: but about 4 Months after &s;he returned thither again; and the Captain &s;aid he felt nothing of the Storm, but when he was about 30 Leagues to Windward of <HI>Tri&s;t,</HI> he had a fre&s;h <HI>Summa&s;enta Wind</HI> that carried him as high as <HI>Cape Condecedo;</HI> but all the time he &s;aw very black Clouds to the We&s;tward.</P>
<P><HI>Beef-I&s;land</HI> is about 7 Leagues long, and 3 or 4 broad. It lies in length Ea&s;t and We&s;t. The Ea&s;t end looks toward the I&s;land <HI>Tri&s;t;</HI> and is low drowned Land: and near the Sea produceth nothing but

<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> white and black Mangrove-Trees. The North &s;ide lies open to the Main Sea, running &s;traight from Ea&s;t to We&s;t. The Ea&s;termo&s;t part for about three Leagues from <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> is Low and Mangrovy; at the end of which there is a &s;mall &s;alt Creek, deep enough at high Water for Boats to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>From this Creek to the We&s;t end, is 4 Leagues all &s;andy Bay, clo&s;ed on the back&s;ide with a low Sand|bank, abounding with thick prickly Bu&s;hes, like a White-thorn; bearing a whiti&s;h hard &s;hell-Fruit, as big as a Sloe, much like a Calla-ba&s;h. The We&s;t end is wa&s;hed with the River St. <HI>Peter</HI> St. <HI>Paul.</HI> This end is over-grown with red Mangroves. About 3 Leagues up from the Mouth of this River &s;hoots forth a &s;mall Branch, running to the Ea&s;tward, and dividing <HI>Beef-I&s;land</HI> from the Main on the South, and afterwards makes a great Lake of fre&s;h Water, cal|led <HI>Fre&s;h Water Lagune.</HI> This afterward falls into a Salt Lake, called <HI>Man-of-War Lagune;</HI> which empties it &s;elf into <HI>Laguna Termina,</HI> about 2 Leagues from the South Ea&s;t Point of the I&s;land.</P>
<P>The in&s;ide or middle of this I&s;land is a Savannah, bordered all round with Trees, mo&s;t Mangrovy; either black, white or red, with &s;ome Logwood.</P>
<P>The South &s;ide, between the Savannahs and the Mangroves is very rich. Some of this Land lyes in Ridges higher than the Savannahs.</P>
<P>The Savannahs produce plenty of long Gla&s;s, and the Ridges curious high flouri&s;hing Trees of divers &s;orts.</P>
<P>The Fruits of this I&s;land are <HI>Penguins,</HI> both red and yellow, <HI>Guavers, Sapadilloes, Limes, Oranges,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e la&s;t but lately planted here by a Colony of <HI>Indians;</HI> who revolted from the Spaniards and &s;ettled here.</P>
<P>It is no new thing for the Indians in the&s;e Woody Parts of <HI>America,</HI> to fly away whole Towns at once, and &s;ettle them&s;elves in the unfrequented

They build every Man his own Hou&s;e, and tye up their Hammacks between two Trees; wherein they &s;leep till their Hou&s;es are made. The Woods afford them &s;ome Sub&s;i&s;tance, as <HI>Pecary</HI> and <HI>Warree;</HI> but they that are thus &s;troling (or <HI>moroon|ing,</HI> as the Spaniards call it) have Plantain-Walks that no Man knows, but them&s;elves; and from thence they have their Food, till they have rai&s;ed Plantation Provi&s;ion near their New-built Town. They clear no more Ground than what they actually employ for their Sub&s;i&s;tance. They make no Paths: but when they go far from Home; they break now and then a Bough; letting it hang down; which &s;erves as a Mark to guide them in their return. If they happen to be di&s;covered by other Indians, inha|biting &s;till among the Spaniards, or do but mi&s;tru&s;t it, they immediately &s;hift their Quarters to another Place. This large Country affording them good fat Land enough, and very Woody, and therefore a proper Sanctuary for them.</P>

<P>This I&s;land does properly belong to <HI>John d' Aco&s;ta</HI> a Spaniard of <HI>Campeachy</HI> Town, who po&s;&s;e&s;s'd it when the Engli&s;h fir&s;t came hither to cut Logwood. His Habitation was then at the Town of <HI>Campeachy;</HI> but in the dry Sea&s;on he u&s;ed to come hither in a Bark, with &s;ix or &s;even Servants, and &s;pend two or three Months in hock&s;ing and killing Cattle, only for their Hides and Tallow.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Logwood-Cutters happened once to come hither, whil&s;t <HI>John d' Aco&s;ta</HI> was there; and he hearing their Guns, made towards them, and de|&s;ired them to forbear firing; becau&s;e it would make the Cattle wild; but told them that any time when they wanted Beef, if they &s;ent to him he would hor as many as they plea&s;ed, and bring the Meat to their Canoas. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> thankfully accepted his Offer; and did never after &s;hoot his Cattle; but &s;ent to him, when they wanted; and he (according to his Promi&s;e) &s;upplied them. This created him &s;o much Friend&s;hip, that they intended when they returned to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to bring him a pre&s;ent, and Goods al|&s;o to Trade with him; which would have been very Advantagious to both Parties: but &s;ome of his Servants acquainted the Town&s;men of it, at his return to <HI>Campeachy.</HI> And they being Jealous of the Engli&s;h, and envying him, complained to the Governour; who pre&s;ently ca&s;t him into Pri&s;on, where he remained many Years: This happened about the Year 71 or 72. Thus the Project of Trading with the Engli&s;h mi&s;carried here, and <HI>John d' Aco&s;ta</HI> was forced to relinqui&s;h his Right of this

<P>This way of Hock&s;ing Bullocks &s;eems peculiar to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> e&s;pecially to tho&s;e that live here|abouts, who are very dextrous at it. For this Rea&s;on &s;ome of of them are con&s;tantly employed in it all the Year; and &s;o become very expert. The <HI>Hock&s;er</HI> is mounted on a good Hor&s;e, bred up to the Sport; who knovv &s;o well vvhen to advance or retreat upon occa&s;ion, that the Rider has no trouble to manage him. His Arms is a Hock&s;ing Iron, which is made in the &s;hape of a Half Moon, and from one corner to the other is about 6 or 7 Inches; vvith a very &s;harp Edge.</P>
<P>This Iron is fa&s;tned by a Socket to a Pole about 14 or 15 Foot long. When the Hock&s;er is mounted, he lays the Pole over the Head of his Hor&s;e, with the Iron forward, and then rides after his Game; and having overtaken it, &s;trikes his Iron ju&s;t above the Hock, and Ham&s;trings it. The Hor&s;e pre&s;ently wheels off to the left; for the wounded Bea&s;t makes at him pre&s;ently with all his force; but he &s;campers away a good di&s;tance before he comes about again. If the Ham&s;tring is not quite cut a&s;under with the &s;troke, yet the Bullock by continual &s;pringing out his Leg, certainly breaks it: and then can go but on three Legs, yet &s;till limps forward to be revenged on his Enemy. Then the Hock&s;er rides up &s;oftly to him and &s;trikes his Iron into the Knee of one of his fore-Legs; and then he immediately tumbles down. He gets off his Hor&s;e, and taking a &s;harp-pointed &s;trong Knife, &s;trikes it into his Pole, a little behind the Horns, &s;o dextrou&s;ly that at one blow he cuts the &s;tring of his Neck; and down falls his Head. This they call <HI>Poling.</HI> Then the Hock&s;er immediately Mounts, and Rides after more Game, leaving the other to the

<P>The right Ear of the Hock&s;ing-Hor&s;e by the weight of the Pole lay'd con&s;tantly over it when on Duty, hangs down always, by which you may know it from other Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> pick and chufe only the Bulls and old Cows, and leave the young Cattle to breed; by which means they always pre&s;erve their Stock entire. On the contrary, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> kill without di&s;tinction; yea, the young rather than the old; without regard of keeping up their Stock. <HI>Jamaica</HI> is a remarkable In&s;tance of this our Folly, in this Particular. For when it was fir&s;t taken by the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> the Savannahs were well &s;tockt with Cattle; but were &s;oon all de&s;troy'd by our Souldiers, who &s;uffered great Hard&s;hips afterwards for it: and it was never &s;tock'd again till Sir <HI>Thomas Linch</HI> was Governour. He &s;ent to <HI>Cuba</HI> for a &s;upply of Cattle, which are now grown very plentiful, becau&s;e every Man knows his own proper Goods. Whereas before, when there was no Property, each Man de&s;troyed as fa&s;t as he could. The <HI>French</HI> (I think) are greater De|&s;troyers than the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Had it not been for the great care of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in Stocking the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> with Hogs and Bullocks, the Privateers mu&s;t have &s;tarved. But now the Main, as well as the I&s;land, is plentiful provided; parti|cularly the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> the I&s;lands of <HI>Cuba, Pines, Hi&s;paniola, Portarica,</HI> &amp;c. Where, be&s;ides wild Hogs, there are abundance of Crawls or Hog|farms; in &s;ome of which, I have heard, there are no le&s;s than 1500. This was the main Sub&s;i&s;tence of the Privateers.</P>
<P>But to return again to <HI>Beef-I&s;land.</HI> Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hunters have much le&s;&s;ened the numbers of the Cat|tle there. And tho&s;e that are left, by con&s;tant &s;hoot|ing are now grown &s;o wild and de&s;perate, that it
<PB N="99" REF="296">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> is dangerous for a &s;ingle Man to fire at them, or to venture through the Savannahs. For the old Bulls that have been formerly &s;hot, will make at him: and they will all draw up in Battalia to defend them|&s;elves upon our approach; the old Bulls in the Front; behind them the Cows, in the &s;ame manner; and behind them the young Cattle. And if we &s;trive to wheel about to get in the Reer, the Bulls will certainly face about that way, and &s;till pre&s;ent a Front to us. Therefore we &s;eldom &s;trive to &s;hoot any out of a great Herd; but walk about in the Woods, clo&s;e by the Savannah; and there we light of our Game. The Bea&s;t makes directly at the Hunter, if it be de&s;perately wounded (as I have ex|perienced my &s;elf) but if but &s;lightly, they com|comly run away. The old Hunters tell us, that a Cow is more dangerous of the two; becau&s;e they &s;ay, &s;he runs at her Enemy with her Eyes open; but the Bull &s;huts his, &s;o that you may ea&s;ily avoid him. But this I cannot affirm upon my own know|ledge, and rather doubt the truth of it; for I knew one &s;hrewdly gor'd by a Bull. He was a Con&s;ort with Mr. <HI>Baker,</HI> in the We&s;t Lagune; where having tir'd them&s;elves with cutting of Logwood, they took an occa&s;ion to go in their Canoa to <HI>Beef-I&s;land,</HI> to re|fre&s;h them&s;elves there a fortnight or three Weeks; becau&s;e here were &s;everal &s;orts of Fruits, and plenty of Cabbage to eat with their fre&s;h Beef, which they could not fail to meet with. They came to a Place call'd the <HI>Salt-Greek;</HI> and there built them a Hut. About 4 a clock while Mr. <HI>Baker</HI> lay down to &s;leep, his Con&s;ort march'd out into the Savannah, about a Mile from their Huts; and there coming within &s;hot of a Bull, wounded him de&s;perate|ly; but yet the Bull had &s;till &s;o much &s;trength left as to pur&s;ue and overtake his Adver&s;ary, trampling on him; and goring his Thigh, &s;o that he was not able
<PB N="100" REF="297">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> to ri&s;e. The Bull by this time was &s;pent, and fell down dead by him: And there the Man had al&s;o peri&s;hed, if Mr. <HI>Barker</HI> had not come the next Mor|ning to &s;eek him; who finding him by the dead Bea&s;t, took him on his Back, and lug'd him home to their Hut. The next day he put him in his Canoa, and delivered him aboard a Ship, into the hands of a Surgeon, who cured him in a little time.</P>
<P>I told you we left Capt. <HI>Chandler,</HI> with a de&s;ign of going to <HI>Beef-I&s;land,</HI> to &s;pend &s;ome time in Hun|ting at <HI>Pies Pond,</HI> before mentioned. But before we came thither we went a &s;hore to kill a Beef for Sup|per; where I was &s;urprized with an odd accident. Pa&s;&s;ing throught a &s;mall Savannah, about 2 or 3 Foot deep, we &s;melt a &s;trong &s;cent of an Alligator; and pre&s;ently after I &s;tumbled over one, and fell down immediarely. I cry'd out for help; but my Con|&s;orts, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting me, ran away towards the Wood. I had no &s;ooner got up to follow them, but I &s;tumbled on him a &s;econd time; and a third time al&s;o; expecting &s;till when I fell down to be de|voured. Yet at la&s;t I got our &s;afe; but &s;o frighted that I never cared for going through the Water again as long as I was in the Bay.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE River St. <HI>Peter</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;prings from the high Mountains of <HI>Chiapo,</HI> about 20 Leagues within the Country, which are &s;o called from a City not far di&s;tant. Its fir&s;t Cour&s;e is Ea&s;terly for a con&s;iderable length, till it meets with Moun|tains on that &s;ide: then it turns &s;hort about North|ward, till within 12 Leagues of the Sea. And la&s;tly, it divides its &s;elf into two Branches. The We&s;tern Branch falls into the River <HI>Toba&s;co;</HI> the other keeps its Cour&s;e till within 4 Leagues of the Sea; then divides it &s;elf again. The Ea&s;termo&s;t of the&s;e Branches &s;eparates <HI>Beef-I&s;land</HI> from the Main; and falls into <HI>Man-of-War Lagune,</HI> as is before related. The other keeps its Cour&s;e and Name till it falls into the Sea, between <HI>Beef-I&s;land</HI> and <HI>To|ba&s;co I&s;land;</HI> where it is no broader than the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Grave&s;end.</HI> There is a Bar at its Entrance, but of what depth I know not; over which &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;els may pa&s;s well enough by the Benefit of the Tide. It is both deeper and broader after you are in; for there it is 15 or 16 Foot Water, and very good Riding. By Report of the Privateers who have been up this River, it is very broad before it
<PB N="102" REF="299">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> parts; and beyond that farther in the Country, has di|vers large Indians Towns built on its Banks: the chief of which is called <HI>Summa&s;enta;</HI> and many large Cacao and Plantains walks: the Soil on each &s;ide being very fruitful. The unmanur'd Land is overgrown with lofty Trees of many &s;orts, e&s;pecially the Cot|ten or Cabbage; of the latter there are whole Groves; and in &s;ome Places (e&s;pecially a little way from the Rivers &s;ide) great Savannahs full of Bul|locks, Hor&s;es, and other Animals; among&s;t which the Mountain Cow (called by the Spaniards <HI>Ante</HI>) is mo&s;t remarkable.</P>
<P>This Bea&s;t is as big as a Bullock of two Years old. It is &s;haped like a Cow in Body; but her Head much bigger. Her No&s;e is &s;hort, and the Head more compact and round. She has no Horns. Her Eyes are round, full, and of a prodigious &s;ize. She has great Lips, but not &s;o thick as the Cows Lips. Her Ears are in proportion to the Head, rather broader than tho&s;e of the Common Cow. Her Neck is thick and &s;hort. Her Legs al&s;o &s;horter than ordinary. She has a pretty long Tail; thin of Hairs, and no Bob at the end. She has cour&s;e thin Hair all over her Body. Her Hide is near two Inches thick. Her fle&s;h is red; the grain of it very fine. The Fat is white, and all together it is &s;weet whol&s;om Meat. One of them will weigh 5 or 600 Weight.</P>
<P>This Creature is always found in the Woods near &s;ome large River; and feeds on a &s;ort of long thin Gra&s;s, or Mo&s;s, which grows plentifully on the Banks of Rivers; but never feeds in Savannahs, or Pa&s;tures of good Gra&s;s, as all other Bullocks do. When her Belly is full, &s;he lies down to &s;leep by the brink of the River; and at the lea&s;t Noi&s;e &s;lips into the Water: where &s;inking down to the bottom, tho' very deep, &s;he walks as on dry Ground. She can|not run fa&s;t, therefore never rambles far from the River; for there &s;he always takes Sanctuary, in ca&s;e
<PB N="103" REF="300">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> of danger. There is no &s;hooting of her, but when &s;he is a&s;leep.</P>
<P>They are found, be&s;ide this Place, in the Rivers in the Bay of <HI>Honduras;</HI> and on all the Main from thence as high as the River of <HI>Darien.</HI> Several of my Con&s;orts have kill'd them there, and knew their Track, which I my &s;elf &s;aw in the I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien;</HI> but &s;hould not have known it, but as I was told by them. For I never did &s;ee one, nor the Track of any but once. The Impre&s;&s;ion in the Sand, &s;eemed much like the Track of a Cow, but I was well a&s;&s;ured that none of our common Cows could live in that Place: neither are there any near it by many Miles.</P>
<P>My Con&s;orts than gave me this Relation, and &s;ince I have had the &s;ame from other Engli&s;h-men as well as Spaniards.</P>
<P>Having &s;hew'd the fore-going De&s;cription to a Per&s;on of Honour, he was plea&s;ed to &s;end it to a Learned Frend in <HI>Holland;</HI> from whom he received this An&s;wer.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Account I have of this Paper from the Engli&s;h Mini&s;ter at <HI>Leyden</HI> is this. The De|&s;cription of your <HI>Sea-Cow,</HI> agrees with the <HI>Hippopo|tamus</HI> kept here&s;o exactly, that I take them to be Crea|tures of the &s;ame kind. Only this here at <HI>Ley|den</HI> is bigger than any Ox. For the Eyes, Ears and Hair, nothing can be &s;aid, &s;eeing this Skin wants all the&s;e. The Teeth are worth noticing, which are very large, and firm, and fine as any Ivory.</P>
<P>I have &s;poke with a very Intelligent Per&s;on, Kin&s;|man to the Burgoma&s;ter of <HI>Leyden,</HI> who having had that <HI>Hippopotamus</HI> (as they call it) pre&s;ented to him, made a Pre&s;ent thereof to the Univer&s;ity; who having viewed that Skin very well, &s;aith, It's much bigger than
<PB N="104" REF="301">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> you make yours, and cannot weigh le&s;s than one Thou|&s;and Weight.</P>
<P>Let me add of mine own, that perhaps they are greater, about the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> whence that of <HI>Leyden</HI> came. And &s;eeing there are no Horns, perhaps it may as well be called a <HI>River-Hor&s;e</HI> as a <HI>River-Cow:</HI> But for that, it mu&s;t bear the de|nomination given it by the People of the Place where they are; which may be different in <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Ame|rica.</HI></P>
<P>But what he &s;ays of her &s;inking to the bottom in deep Rivers, and walking there, if he adds, what I think he &s;uppo&s;es, that he ri&s;es again, and comes on the Land; I much que&s;tion. For that &s;uch a huge Body &s;hould rai&s;e it &s;elf up again (though I know <HI>Whales</HI> and great Fi&s;hes can and do) tran&s;cends the Faith of I. H.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>I readily acknowledge, there is &s;ome re&s;emblance between this <HI>Monntain-Cow</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> and the <HI>African Hippopotamus;</HI> but yet am of Opinion that they mu&s;t needs be of a different Species; for the <HI>Mountain-Cow</HI> is never known to &s;wim out to Sea, nor to be found near it; and is not above half &s;o big, and has no long Teeth. But for further &s;atisfaction, I have here infected two Accounts of the <HI>African Hippopotamus,</HI> as they were &s;ent; the one of the Honourable Per&s;on before-mentioned, from Captain <HI>Covent</HI> of <HI>Porbury,</HI> near <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> a Gentleman of great Ability and Experience, as well as known In|tegrity, who u&s;ed to Trade to <HI>Angola:</HI> The other to my &s;elf, from my worthy Friend Captain <HI>Rogers,</HI> as he has &s;een them in the River <HI>Natal,</HI> in the La|titude of 30, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea Hor&s;e's Head, Ears and No&s;trils are like our Hor&s;es; with a &s;hort Tail and Legs. And his Foot|&s;teps in the Sand like a Hor&s;es; but the Body above
<PB N="105" REF="302">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> twice as big. He gra&s;es on the &s;hore, and dungs like a Hor&s;e. Is of a dark-brown, but glittering in the Water. His pace is but &s;low on the &s;hore; in the Water more &s;wift. He there feeds on &s;mall Fi&s;h and what he can get; and will go down to the bot|tom in 3 Fathom Water. For I have watch'd him; and he hath &s;taid above half an hour before he aro&s;e. He is very mi&s;chievous to white Men. I have known him open his Mouth and &s;et one Tooth on the Gunnel of a Boat, and another on the &s;econd Strake from the Keel (which was more than four foot di&s;tant) and there bit a hole through the Plank, and &s;unk the Boat; and after he had done, he went away &s;haking his Ears. His &s;trength is incredibly great; for I have &s;een him in the Wa&s;h of the &s;hore, when the Sea has to&s;&s;ed in a Dutch-man's Boat, with 14 Hog&s;heads of Water in her, upon the &s;aid Bea&s;t; and left it dry on his Back; and another Sea came and fetch'd the Boat off, and the Bea&s;t was not hurt, as far as I could perceive. How his Teeth grow in his Mouth I could not &s;ee; only that they were round like a Bow, and about 16 Inches long; and in the bigge&s;t part more than 6 Inches about. We made &s;everal &s;hot at him; but to no purpo&s;e, for they would glance from him as from a Wall. The Natives call him a <HI>Kittimpungo,</HI> and &s;ay he is <HI>Fe|ti&s;&s;o,</HI> which is a kind of a God; for nothing, they &s;ay can kill him: And if they &s;hould do to him, as the White Men do, he would &s;oon de&s;troy their Ca|noas and Fi&s;hing-Nets. Their Cu&s;tom is when he comes near their Canoas, to throw him Fi&s;h; and then he pa&s;&s;eth away, and will not meddle with their Fi&s;hing Craft. He doth mo&s;t mi&s;chief when he can &s;tand on the Ground; but when a-float, hath only power to bite. As our Boat once lay near the &s;hore, I &s;aw him go under her, and with his Back lift her out of the Water; and over&s;et her with 6 Men aboard: but, as it happened, did them no harm.
<PB N="106" REF="303">

<P>THE <HI>Hippopotamus</HI> or <HI>Sea-Hor&s;e,</HI> lives as well on the Land as in the Sea or in Rivers. It is &s;ha|ped much like an Ox, but bigger; weighing 1500 or, 1600<HI>l.</HI> This Creature is very full bodied, and co|vered with Hair of a Mou&s;e Colour; thick, &s;hort and of a very beautiful &s;leekne&s;s, when he fir&s;t comes out of the Water. The Head is flatti&s;h on the top. It has no Horns: but large Lips, a wide Mouth and &s;trong Teeth; four of which are longer than the re&s;t, <HI>(viz.)</HI> two in the upper Jaw; one on each &s;ide and two more in the under: The&s;e la&s;t are four or five Inches long; the other two are &s;horter. It has large broad Ears; great goggle Eyes; and is very quick &s;ighted. It has a thick Neck; and &s;trong Legs, but weak Footlocks. The Hoofs of his Feet are Cloven in the middle: And it has two &s;mall Hoofs above the Footlock, which bending to the Ground when it goes, make an Impre&s;&s;ion on the Sand like four Claws. His Tail is &s;hort and tapering like a Swines; without any Bob at the end. This Bea&s;t is commonly fat and very good Meat. It grazeth a&s;hore in wet &s;wampy Ground near Rivers or Ponds; but retires to the Water, if puru&s;ed. When they are in the Water, they will &s;ink down to the bottom; and there walk as on dry Ground. They will run almo&s;t as fa&s;t as a Man; but if cha&s;ed hard, they will turn about and look very fierce, like a Boar; and fight if put to it. The Na|tives

The Hor&s;e, according to his Cu&s;tom, was marching in the bottom of the River; and being &s;pied by the&s;e Men, they wounded him with a long Lance; which &s;o enraged the Bea&s;t, that he ro&s;e up immediately, and giving a fierce look he opened his Jaws and bit a great piece of the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">nal or upper edge of the Canoa, and was like to over-&s;et it, but pre&s;ently &s;unk down again to the bot|tom: and the Men made away as fa&s;t as they could, for fear he &s;hould come again.</P>

There are al&s;o &s;ome <HI>Coco-Plums</HI> and <HI>Grapes,</HI> but not many. The Savannahs here are na|turally fenced with Groves of Guavers, and produce
<PB N="108" REF="305">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> good Gra&s;s for Pa&s;ture, and are pretty well &s;tock'd with fat Bullocks: and I do believe it is from their eating the Guaver Fruit that the&s;e Trees are &s;o thick. For this fruit is full of &s;mall &s;eeds; which being &s;wal|lowed whole by the Cattle, are voided whole by them again; and then taking root in their Dung, &s;pring up abundantly.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o Deer in great numbers; the&s;e we|con&s;tantly find feeding in the Savannahs Mornings and Evenings. And I remember an unlucky Accident whil&s;t I was there. Two or three Men went out one Evening purpo&s;ely to hunt; when they were in the &s;pots of Savannahs, they &s;eparated to find their Game, and at la&s;t it &s;o happened, that one of them fired at a Deer and killed it, and while he was &s;kin|ning it, he was &s;hot &s;tark dead by one of his Con|&s;orts, who fired at him, mi&s;taking him for a Deer. The poor Man was very &s;orry for &s;o &s;ad a mi&s;chance; and for fear of the dead Man's Friends, dur&s;t never go back again to <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>The River of <HI>Toba&s;co</HI> is the mo&s;t noted in all the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and &s;prings al&s;o from the high Mountains of <HI>Chiapo;</HI> but much more to the We&s;t|ward than that of St. <HI>Peter</HI> St. <HI>Paul.</HI> From thence it runs N. E. till within 4 Leagues of the Sea, where it receives the fore-mentioned Branch of St. <HI>Peter</HI> St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and then runs North till it falls into the Sea. Its Mouth is about two Miles wide, and there is a Bar of Sand lying off it, with not above 11 or 12 foot Water; but a Mile or two within the Mouth, at a nook or bending of the River on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide there is three Fathom, and good Riding, without any danger from the &s;trength of the Cur|rent. The Tide flows up about four Leagues in the dry Sea&s;on, but in the Rains not &s;o far; for then the Fre&s;hes make the Ebb run very &s;trong.</P>
<P>During the Norths it over-flows all the low Land
<PB N="109" REF="306">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> for 14 or 15 Leagues up the River, and you may then take up fre&s;h Water without the Bar.</P>
<P>This River, near its Mouth, abounds with Cat|fi&s;h, with &s;ome Snooks, and <HI>Manatee</HI> in great plen|ty; there being good feeding for them in many of its Creeks, e&s;pecially in one place on the Starbord &s;ide about 2 Leagues from the Sea, which runs in|to the Land 2 or 300 paces, and then opens very wide, and is &s;o &s;hoal that you may &s;ee their backs above Water as they feed; a thing &s;o rare, that I have heard our <HI>Mu&s;keto-Men</HI> &s;ay, they never &s;aw it any where el&s;e; on the lea&s;t noi&s;e they will all &s;camper out into the <HI>River:</HI> yet the <HI>Mu&s;keto-men</HI> &s;eldom mi&s;s of &s;triking them.

<P><HI>Villa de Mo&s;e</HI> is a &s;mall Town &s;tanding on the Starboard &s;ide of the River, 4 Leagues beyond this Brea&s;t-work.

'Tis the be&s;t Town on this River, having three Chnrches, and &s;everal Rich Merchants; and between it and <HI>Villa de Mo&s;e</HI> are many large Cacao Walks on each &s;ide the River.</P>
<P>I have &s;een a &s;ort of white Cacao brought from hence, which I never met with any where el&s;e. It is of the &s;ame bigne&s;s and colour on the out&s;ide, and with &s;uch a thin hu&s;ky Coat as the other; but the inner &s;ub&s;tance is white, like fine Flower; and when the outward Coat is broken, it crumbles as a lump of Flower doth. Tho&s;e that frequent the Bay call it <HI>Spama,</HI> and affirm that it is much u&s;ed by the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> of tho&s;e parts, to make their Chocolate froth, who therefore &s;et a great value on it.

<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> with <HI>Indian</HI> Towns, who have all a Padre or two among them, and a Cacique or <HI>Governour</HI> to keep the Peace. The <HI>Cacao Tree</HI> thrives here very well; but the Nuts are &s;maller than the <HI>Caraccus Nuts;</HI> yet Oyly and Fat whil&s;t new. They are not plant|ed near the Sea, as they are on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Caraccus,</HI> but at lea&s;t 8 or 10 Miles up in the Country. The Cacao-walks belong chiefly to the Spaniards; and are only planted and dre&s;s'd by Indians, hired for that purpo&s;e; yet the Indians have of their own, Plantain-walks, Plantations of Maiz, and &s;ome &s;mall Cacao-walks; about which they &s;pent the chiefe&s;t of their time. Some employ them&s;elves to &s;earch in the Woods for Bees that build in hol|low Trees: and get a good livelihood by the Honey and Wax. The&s;e are of two &s;orts: One pretty large; the other no bigger, but longer, than an or|dinary black Fly: in other re&s;pects, ju&s;t like our common Bees; only of a darker colour. Their Stings are not &s;trong enough to enter a Man's Skin; but if di&s;turbed, they will fly at one as furiou&s;ly as the Great Bees; and will tickle, but cannot hurt you. Their Honey is white and clear; and they make a great deal of it. The Indians keep of them tame, and cut hollow Trunks for them to make their Combs in. They place one end of the Log (which is &s;aw'd very even) on a Board, leaving a hole for the Bees to creep in at: and the upper end is covered with a Board, put clo&s;e over it. The young and lu&s;ty Indians (&s;uch as want Em|ployment) hire them&s;elves to the Spaniards. They Work cheap, and are commonly paid in &s;uch Goods as the Spaniards do not value. And I have been told that they are obliged to Work for their Ma|&s;ters, one day in a Week, <HI>gratis:</HI> But whether this Priviledge belongs only to the <HI>Padres,</HI> or to the Laity al&s;o, I know not. The Indians inhabiting the&s;e Villages, live like Gentlemen in Compari&s;on

<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> of tho&s;e that are near any great Town, &s;uch as <HI>Campeachy</HI> or <HI>Merida:</HI> for there even the Poorer and Ra&s;cally &s;ort of People, that are not able to hire one of the&s;e poor Creatures, will by violence drag them to do their Drudgery for nothing, after they have work'd all day for their Ma&s;ters: nay, they often take them out of the Market from their Bu&s;ine&s;s; or at lea&s;t enjoyn them to come to their Hou&s;es when their Market is ended: and they dare not refu&s;e to do it.</P>
<P>This Country is very fruitful; yelding plentiful Crops of Maiz; which is there chiefe&s;t Sub&s;i&s;t|ence. After it is boiled they brui&s;e it on &s;uch a Rub|bing-Stone as Chocolate is ground on. Some of it they make into &s;mall thin Cakes, called <HI>Tartilloes.</HI> The re&s;t they are put into a Jar till it grows &s;owr; and when they are thir&s;ty, mix a handful of it in a Cal|laba&s;h of Water, which gives it a &s;harp plea&s;ant ta&s;te, then &s;training it through a large Callaba&s;h prick'd full of &s;mall Holes to keep out the Hu&s;ks, they drink it off. If they treat a Friend with this Drink, they mix a little Honey with it; for their Ability reaches no higher: And this is as acceptable to them as a Gla&s;s of Wine to us. If they travel for two or three Days from Home, they carry &s;ome of this ground Maiz in a Plantain Leaf, and Cal|laba&s;h at their Girdles to make their drink, and take no farther care for Victuals, till they come home again. This is called <HI>Po&s;ole:</HI> And by the Engli&s;h <HI>Poor&s;oul.</HI> It is &s;o much e&s;teemed by the Indians, that they are never without &s;ome of it in their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Another way of Preparing their Drink, is to parch the Maiz, and then grind it to Powder on the Rubbing-&s;tone, putting a little <HI>Anatta</HI> to it; which grows in their Plantations, and is u&s;ed by them for no other purpo&s;e. They mix it all
<PB N="114" REF="311">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> with Water, and pre&s;ently drink it off without &s;training.</P>
<P>In long Journeys they prefer this Drink before Po&s;ole.</P>
<P>They feed abundance of Turkies, Ducks and Dung|hill Fowls, of which the Padre has an exact Ac|count; and is very &s;trict in gathering his Tithe: and they dare not kill any except they have his Leave for it.</P>
<P>They plant Cotton al&s;o for their Cloathing. The Men wear only a &s;hort Jacket and Breeches. The&s;e with a Palmeto-Leaf Hat is their <HI>Sundays</HI> Dre&s;s; for they have neither Stockings nor Shoes; neither do they wear the&s;e Jackets on Week Days. The Women have a Cotton-Petticoat, and a large Frock down to their Knees; the Sleeves to their Wri&s;ts, but not gathered. The Bo&s;om is open to the Brea&s;t, and Imbroidered with black or red Silk, or Grogram Yarn, two Inches broad on each &s;ide the Brea&s;t, and clear round the Neck. In this Garb, with their Hair ty'd up in a Knot behind, they think them&s;elves extream fine.</P>
<P>The Men are obliged by the Padres (as I have been inform'd) to Marry when they are Fourteen Years old, and the Women when Twelve: And if that Age they are not provided, the Prie&s;t will chu&s;e a Virgin for the Man (or a Man for the Vir|gin) of Equal Birth and Fortune; and joyn them to|gether.</P>
<P>The Spaniards give &s;everal Rea&s;ons for this Im|po&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI> That it pre&s;erves them from De|baucher, and makes them Indu&s;trious.&mdash;That it brings them to pay Taxes, both to the King and Church; for as &s;oon as they are Married they pay to both.&mdash;And that it keeps them from ram|bling out of their own Pari&s;h, and &s;ettling in another, which would by &s;o much le&s;&s;en the Pa|dres

<P>The Churches are large, built much higher than the Common Hou&s;es, and covered with Pantile: and within adorned with Coar&s;e Pictures and Ima|ges of Saints; which are all painted tauny like the Indians them&s;elves.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving given the Reader an Account of the Indians inhabiting about the River of <HI>Toba&s;co;</HI> I come next to de&s;cribe the We&s;tern Coa&s;t of this Bay, with its Rivers and other mo&s;t re|markable Particulars. From <HI>Toba&s;co</HI> River to the
<PB N="118" REF="315">
<MILESTONE N="1766" UNIT="year"> River <HI>Checapeque</HI> is 7 Leagues. The Coa&s;t lies Ea&s;t and We&s;t; all Woody low Ground, &s;andy Bay, and good Anchoring; but there falls in a pretty high Sea on the &s;hore, therefore but bad Landing; yet Canoas may with care run in, if the Men are ready to leap out, as &s;oon as &s;he touches the Ground; and then &s;he mu&s;t immediately be drag'd up out of the Surf. And the &s;ame caution and dex|terity is to be u&s;ed when they go off again. There is no fre&s;h Water between <HI>Toba&s;co</HI> River and <HI>Che|capeque.</HI> This latter is rather a &s;alt Creek than a River; for the Mouth of it is not above 20 Paces wide, and about 8 or 9 Foot Water on the Bar; but within there is 12 or 13 Foot at low Water, and good riding for Barks, half a Mile within the Mouth.</P>
<P>This Creek runs in E. S. E. about two Miles, and then &s;trikes away South up into the Country. At its Mouth between it and the Sea is a bare &s;andy Point of Land: Where, on the &s;ide next the River, clo&s;e by the Brink of it (and no where el&s;e) you may &s;crape up the Sand (which is cour&s;e and brown) with your Hands, and get fre&s;h Water; but if you dig lower the Water will be &s;alt. Half a Mile within the Mouth, when you are pa&s;t the &s;andy Point, the Land is wet and &s;wampy, bearing only Mangroves on each &s;ide for 4 or 5 Leagues up; and after that firm Land: where you will find a Run of fre&s;h Wa|ter, it being all &s;alt till you come thither. A League beyond this is a Beef E&s;tantion or Farm of Cattle, belonging to an Indian Village. In the Woods on each &s;ide this River there are plenty of Guanoes, Land Turtle, and abundance of Quams and Corre&s;os, with &s;ome Parrots; and there is no Settlement nearer than the Beef E&s;tantion: nor any thing el&s;e remark|able in this River that I know.</P>
<P>A League We&s;t from <HI>Checapeque</HI> there is another &s;mall River called <HI>Dos Boccas,</HI> 'tis only fit for Ca|noas
<PB N="119" REF="316">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> to enter: It has a Bar at its Mouth, and there|fore is &s;omewhat dangerous. Yet the Privateers make light of it; for they will govern a Canoa very ingeniou&s;ly. However Captain <HI>Rives</HI> and Cap|tain <HI>Hewet,</HI> two Privateers, lo&s;t &s;everal Men here in coming out; for there had been a North, which had rai&s;ed the Bar, and in going out mo&s;t of their Canoas were over&s;et, and &s;ome Men drowned.</P>
<P>This River will not float a Canoa above a League within its Mouth, and &s;o far is &s;alt: but there you meet with a fine clear Stream of fre&s;h Water, about a League up in the Country: and beyond this are fair Savannahs of long Gra&s;s, fenced in with Ridges of as rich Land as any in the World. The Mold &s;uch as is formerly de&s;cribed; all plain and level, even to the Hills of <HI>Chiapo.</HI></P>
<P>There are no Indian Towns within 4 or 5 Leagues of the Sea; but further off they are pretty thick; lying within a League, 2 or 3 one after another: <HI>Halpo</HI> is the chiefe&s;t.</P>
<P>The Indians make u&s;e of no more Land than &s;erves to maintain their Families in Maiz; and to pay their Taxes: And therefore between the Towns it lies uncultivated.</P>
<P>In all this Country they rear abundance of Poul|try, <HI>Viz.</HI> Turkies, Ducks and Dunghil Fowls: but &s;ome of them have Cacao-Walks. The Cacao of the&s;e Parts is mo&s;t of it &s;ent to <HI>Villa de Mo&s;e,</HI> and &s;hip'd off there. Some of it is &s;old to Carriers that travail with Mules, coming hither commonly in <HI>Nov.</HI> or <HI>Dec.</HI> and &s;taying till <HI>Febr.</HI> or <HI>March.</HI> They lye a Fortnight at a time in a Village to di&s;po&s;e of their Goods; which are commonly Hatchets, Ma|cheats, Axes, Hoes, Knives, Cizars, Needles, Thread, Silk for &s;owing, Womens Frocks; &s;mall Looking|gla&s;&s;es, Beads, Silver or Copper Rings wa&s;h'd with Gold, &s;et with Gla&s;s in&s;tead of Stones, &s;mall Pi|ctures of Saints, and &s;uch like Toys for the Indians.

When he has &s;old off his Goods, he is generally paid in Cacao, which he carries to <HI>La Vera Cruz.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Dos Boccas</HI> to the River <HI>Palmas</HI> is 4 Leagues, low Land and &s;andy Bay between.</P>
<P>From <HI>Palmas</HI> to the <HI>Halover</HI> is 2 Leagues.</P>
<P>The <HI>Halover</HI> is a &s;mall Neck of Land, parting the Sea from a large Lagune. It is &s;o call'd by the Privateers, becau&s;e they u&s;e to drag their Ca|noas in and out there.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Halover</HI> to St. <HI>Anns</HI> is 6 Leagues.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Anns</HI> is a Mouth that opens the Lagune be|fore mention'd: there is not above 6 or 7 Foot Water, yet Barks often go in there to Careen.</P>
<P>From St. <HI>Anns</HI> to <HI>Tondelo</HI> is 5 Leagues. The Coa&s;t &s;till We&s;t; the Land low, and &s;andy Bay again&s;t the Sea: a little within which are pretty high Sand-Banks, cloathed with prickly Bu&s;hes, &s;uch as I have already de&s;cribed at <HI>Beef-I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>Again&s;t the Sea near the We&s;t end, within the Sand Bank, the Land is lower again; the Woods not very high, and &s;ome &s;pots of Savannahs, with plenty of fat Bullocks; In hunting of which a Frenchman unhappily lo&s;t his Life. For his Com|pany being &s;tragled from him to find Game, he unluckily met a Drove of Cattle flying from them in the Woods, which were &s;o thick that there was no pa&s;&s;ing but in the&s;e very narrow Paths that the Cattle them&s;elves had made; &s;o that not being able to get out of their way, the foremo&s;t of the Drove thru&s;t his Horns into his Back and carried him 100 Paces into the Savannah, where he fell down with his Guts trailing on the Ground.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="318">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> The River <HI>Tondelo</HI> is but narrow, yet capable to receive Barks of 50 or 60 Tuns: there is a Bar at the Entrance, and the Channnel crooked. On the We&s;t &s;ide of the Bar there is a &s;pit of Sand &s;hoots out; therefore to avoid it at your coming in, you mu&s;t keep the Ea&s;t &s;ide aboard; but when once en|tred, you may run up for two or three Leagues; on the Ea&s;t &s;ide a quarter of a Mile within the Mouth, you may lie &s;ecure: but all this Coa&s;t, and e&s;pe|cially this River, intolerably &s;warms with <HI>Musketoes,</HI> that there is no &s;leeping for them.</P>
<P>About 4 or 5 Leagues from the Mouth this River is fordable, and there the Road cro&s;&s;es it; where two French Canoas that lay in this River intercepted the Caravan of Mules laden with Cacao, that was returning to <HI>La Vera Cruz,</HI> taking away as much as they could carry with them.</P>
<P>From <HI>Tondelo</HI> River, to the River of <HI>Gua&s;ickwalp,</HI> is 8 Leagues more, the Coa&s;t &s;till We&s;t; all along &s;andy Bay and Sand-hills, as between <HI>St. Anns</HI> and <HI>Tondelo;</HI> only towards the We&s;t part the Bank is lower, and the Trees higher. This is one of the Principal Rivers of this Coa&s;t; 'tis not half the breadth of the <HI>Toba&s;co River,</HI> but deeper. Its Bar is le&s;s dangerous than any on this Coa&s;t, having 14 foot Water on it, and but little Sea. Within the Bar there is much more, and &s;oft Oa&s;ie Ground. The Banks on both &s;ides are low. The Ea&s;t &s;ide is woody, and the We&s;t &s;ide Savannah. Here are &s;ome Cat|tle; but &s;ince it has been frequented by Privateers, the Spaniards have driven mo&s;t of their Bullocks from hence farther into the Country. This River hath its ri&s;e near the South Sea, and is Navigable a great way into Land; e&s;pecially with Boats or &s;mall Barks.</P>
<P>The River <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">guantepeque,</HI> that falls into the South Seas, has its Origine near the Head of <HI>Gua&s;ickwalp;</HI> and it is reported that the fir&s;t Naval Stores for the

But how gro&s;ly they are mi&s;taken, I have &s;atisfied the World already. And for this part of the Country, though it is rich in Land, yet it has not the lea&s;t appearance of any Mine, neither is it thick inhabited with Spaniards: And if I am not deceived, the very Indians in the heart of the Country, are &s;carce their Friends.</P>
<P>The Town of note on the S. Sea, is <HI>Teguantapeque;</HI> and on the N. Seas <HI>Keyhooca</HI> is the chiefe&s;t near this River. Be&s;ides the&s;e two, the Country is only in|habited by Indians; therefore it is wholly unfre|quented by Shipping.</P>
<P><HI>Keyhooca</HI> is a large rich Town of good Trade, about 4 Leagues from the River <HI>Gua&s;ickwalp,</HI> on the We&s;t fide. It is inhabited with &s;ome few <HI>Spa|niards</HI> and abundance of Mulatoes. The&s;e keep many Mules, they being mo&s;t Carriers, and fre|quently vi&s;it the Cacao Coa&s;t for Nuts; and travel the Country between <HI>Villa de Mo&s;e</HI> and <HI>La Vera Cruz.</HI></P>
<P>This Country is plea&s;ant enough in the dry Sea&s;on; but when the furious North Winds rage on the Coa&s;t, and violently drive in the Sea, it &s;uffers ex|treamly, being &s;o much overflown, that there is no travelling. It was in the wet Sea&s;on when Capt. <HI>Rives</HI> and Capt. <HI>Hewet</HI> made an Expedition in Ca|noas from the I&s;land <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> to the River <HI>Gua&s;ickwalp,</HI> and there landed their Men, de&s;igning to attack <HI>Keyhooca;</HI> but the Country was &s;o wet that there was no marching; neither was the Water high
<PB N="123" REF="320">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> enough for a Canoa. Here are great plenty of <HI>Vi|nelles.</HI></P>
<P>From the River <HI>Gua&s;ickwalp</HI> the Land runs We&s;t 2 or 3 Leagues, all low Land with &s;andy Bay to the Sea, and very woody in the Country. About three Leagues to the We&s;t of it the Land trends away to the North for about 16 Leagues; ri&s;ing higher al&s;o even from the very Shore, as you go up within Land, making a very high Promontory called St. <HI>Martins</HI> Land; but ending in a pretty bluff point; which is the We&s;t Bounds of the Bay of <HI>Campeachy.</HI></P>
<P>From this bluff Point to <HI>Alvarado</HI> is about 20 Leagues; the fir&s;t four of it a high rocky &s;hore, with &s;teep Cliffs to the Sea; and the Land &s;ome|what woody. Afterwards you pa&s;s by very high Sand-Hills by the Sea; and an extraordinary great Sea falls in on the &s;hore, which hinders any Boats from Landing. Within the Sand-hills again the Land is lower, pretty plain and fruitful enough in large Trees.</P>
<P>The River of <HI>Alvarado</HI> is above a Mile over at the Mouth, yet the entrance is but &s;hole, there be|ing Sands for near two Mile off the &s;hore, clear from &s;ide to &s;ide, neverthele&s;s there are two Chan|nels through the&s;e Sands. The be&s;t, which is in the middle, has 12 or 14 Foot Water. The Land on each &s;ide of the Mouth is high <HI>Sand-banks,</HI> above 200 Foot high.</P>
<P>This River comes out of the Country in three Branches, meeting altogether ju&s;t within the Mouth, where it is very wide and deep. One of the&s;e Branches comes from the Ea&s;tward: Another from the We&s;tward: And the third, which is the true River of <HI>Alvarado</HI> and the bigge&s;t, comes directly out of the Country, oppo&s;ite to the Sand-hills, about a Mile We&s;t of the Rivers Mouth. This la&s;t &s;prings a great way from the Sea, pa&s;&s;ing through a very fertile Country, thick &s;etled with Towns of <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="321">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> and <HI>Indians.</HI> On the We&s;t &s;ide, and ju&s;t again&s;t the Mouth of the River, the <HI>Spainiarde</HI> have a &s;mall Fort of 6 Guns, on the declivity of the <HI>Sand-bank,</HI> a great height above the River; which commands a &s;mall <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Town on the back of it, built in a Plain clo&s;e by the River. It is a great Fi&s;hery, chiefly for Snooks, which they catch in the Lake; and when they are &s;alted and dryed, drive a great Trade in Exchanging them for Salt and other Com|modities. Be&s;ides &s;alt Fi&s;h, they export from hence abundance of dry Cod-Pepper, and &s;ome pickled and put in Jars. This Pepper is known by the Name of <HI>Guinea Pepper.</HI> Yet for all this Trade, 'tis but a poor Place, and has been often taken by the Privateers, chiefly to &s;ecure their Ships while they &s;hould go up in their Canoas to the rich Towns within Land, which notwith&s;tanding they never yet attempted, by rea&s;on that <HI>La Vera Cruz</HI> bor|dering &s;o near, they were &s;till afraid of being at|tacqued both by <HI>Sea</HI> and <HI>Land</HI> from thence, and &s;o never dur&s;t pro&s;ecute their de&s;igns on the Country Towns.</P>
<P>Six Leagues We&s;t from <HI>Alvarado</HI> there is another large Opening out into the Sea; and it is reported to have a Communication by a &s;mall Creek with this River of <HI>Alvarado;</HI> and that Canoas may pa&s;s through it from one River to the other. And at this Opening is a &s;mall Fi&s;hing Village. The Land by the Sea is a continued high Sand-bank, and &s;o vio|lent a Sea, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to land with Boat or Canoa.</P>
<P>From this River to <HI>La Vera Cruz</HI> is &s;ix Leagues more, the Coa&s;t &s;till We&s;t. There is a Riff of Rocks runs along the &s;hore from <HI>Alvarado</HI> to <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> yet a good Channel for &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els to pa&s;s be|tween it and the Shore. And about two Leagues to the Ea&s;t of <HI>Vera Cruz</HI> are two I&s;lands called <HI>Sa|crifice I&s;lands.</HI> I have &s;et down the di&s;tance between
<PB N="125" REF="322">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> <HI>Alvarado</HI> and <HI>La Vera Cruz,</HI> according to the Com|mon Account of 12 Leagues, which I take to be truer, but our Draughts make it 24. The Land by the Sea is much the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>La Vera Cruz</HI> is a fair Town &s;eated in the very bottom of the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> at the S. W. Point or Corner of the Bay; for &s;o far the Land runs We&s;t; and there it turns about to the North. There is a good Harbour before it, made by a &s;mall I&s;land, or Rock rather, ju&s;t in its Mouth; which makes it very Commodious. Here the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have built a &s;trong Fort, which commands the Harbour; and there are great Iron Rings fix'd in the Fort-Wall again&s;t the Harbour for <HI>Ships</HI> to fa&s;ten their Ca|bles. For the North Winds blow &s;o violently here in their <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> that <HI>Ships</HI> are not &s;afe at An|chors.</P>
<P>This Fort is called St. <HI>John d' Ulloa;</HI> and the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> do frequently call the Town of <HI>Vera Cruz</HI> by this Name.</P>
<P>The Town is a Place of great Trade; being the <HI>Sea-Port</HI> to the City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and mo&s;t of the great Towns and Cities in this Kingdom. So that all the European Commodities, &s;pent in the&s;e Parts, are Landed here, and their Goods brought hither and exported from hence. Add to this, that all the Trea&s;ure brought from <HI>Manila,</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> comes hither through the Country from <HI>Ac|capulca.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Flota</HI> comes hither every three Years from <HI>Old Spain;</HI> and be&s;ides Goods of the Product of the Country, and what is brought from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> and &s;hip'd aboard them: The King's Plate that is gathered in this Kingdom; together with what belongs to the Merchants, amounts to a va&s;t <HI>Summ.</HI> Here al&s;o comes every Year the <HI>Barra|lavanta Fleet</HI> in <HI>October</HI> or <HI>November,</HI> and &s;tays till <HI>March.</HI> This is a &s;mall <HI>Squadron,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of 6

<P><HI>La Vera Cruz</HI> was taken by the Privateers, about the Year 85. under the conduct of one <HI>John Ru&s;&s;el</HI> an old Logwood Cutter that had formerly been taken by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and &s;ent to <HI>Mexico;</HI> where learning <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> he by that means e&s;caped to <HI>La Vera Cruz;</HI> and being relea&s;ed from thence, he af|terwards managed this Expedition.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="324">
<MILESTONE N="1676" UNIT="year"> From hence to <HI>Old Vera Cruz</HI> is 5 Leagues. This was the fir&s;t Town of that Name; but wanting a good Harbour there, it was removed to the place where it now &s;tands.</P>

<P>From <HI>Ti&s;po</HI> to the River <HI>Panuk</HI> is about 20 Leagues; The Coa&s;t lies N. and S. neare&s;t, 'tis a large River de&s;cending out of the very Bowels of the Country, and running Ea&s;t, falls into the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> in Lat. about 21-50 m. It has 10 or 11 Foot Water on the Bar, and is often vi&s;ited with Barks that &s;ail up it, as far as the City <HI>Panuk;</HI> lying di&s;tant from the Sea about 20 Leagues; and is the principal of this Country, being a Bi&s;hops See.

<P>One Branch of this River comes out of the La|gune of <HI>Tompeque,</HI> and mixes with this, three Leagues before it falls into the Sea. Therefore 'tis &s;ometimes called the River of <HI>Tompeque.</HI> The La|gune of <HI>Tompeque</HI> lies on the South &s;ide of the Ri|ver; and breeds abundance of Fi&s;h, e&s;pecially <HI>Shrimps.</HI> There is a Town of the &s;ame Name, built on its Banks, who&s;e inhabitants are mo&s;t Fi|&s;hermen.

<P>The Account I have given of the <HI>Campeachy</HI> Rivers, &amp;c. was the re&s;ult of the particular Ob&s;er|vations I made in crui&s;ing about that Coa&s;t, in which I &s;pent 11 or 12 Months. For when the vio|lent <HI>Storm,</HI> before-mentioned took us, I was but ju&s;t &s;ettling to Work, and not having a &s;tock of Wood to purcha&s;e &s;uch Provi&s;ion as was &s;ent from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> as the old <HI>Standards</HI> had; I, with many more in my circum&s;tances, was forced to range about to &s;eek a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance in Company of &s;ome Privateers then in the Bay. In which rambles we vi&s;i|ted all the Rivers, from <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> to <HI>Alvarado;</HI> and made many De&s;cents into the County among the Villages there, where we got Indian-Corn to eat with the Beef, and other Fle&s;h that we got by the way, or Manatee and Turtle, which was al&s;o a great &s;upport to us.</P>
<P><HI>Alvarado</HI> was the We&s;termo&s;t place I was at Thither we went in two Barks with 30 Men in each and had 10 or 11 kill'd and de&s;perately wound|ed in taken the Fort; being four or five Hours en|gag'd in that Service, in which time the Inhabitants having plenty of Boats and Canoas, carried all their Riches and be&s;t Moveables away. It was after Sun-&s;et before the Fort yielded; and growing dark, we could not pur&s;ue them, but re&s;ted quietly that Night; the next day we kill'd, &s;alted and &s;ent aboard 20 or 30 Beefs, and a good quanity of Salt-fi&s;h, and Indian Corn, as much as we could &s;tow away. Here were but few Hogs, and tho&s;e eat very fi&s;hy, therefore we did not much e&s;teem them: but of Cocks, Hens and Ducks were &s;ent aboard in abun|dance. The tame Parrots we found here were the large&s;t and faire&s;t Birds of their kind that I ever &s;aw in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> Their colour was yellow
<PB N="129" REF="326">
and red, very cour&s;ly mixt; and they would prate very prettily; and there was &s;carce a Man but what &s;ent aboard one or two of them. So that with Pro|vi&s;ion, Che&s;ts, Hen-Coops and Parrot-Cages, our Ships were full of Lumber, with which we intended to &s;ail: But the &s;econd Day after we took the Fort, having had a We&s;terly Wind all the Morning, with Rain, 7 Armadilloes that were &s;ent from <HI>La Verd Cruz</HI> appeared in &s;ight, within a Mile of the Bars, coming in with full &s;ail; but they could &s;carce &s;tem the Current of the River; which was very well for us; for we were not a little &s;urprized. Yet we got under &s;ail, in order to meet them; and clearing our Decks by heaving all the Lumber over-board, we drove out over the Bar, before they reach|ed it: But they being to Wind-ward, forced us to exchange a few &s;hot with them. Their Admi|ral was called the <HI>Toro.</HI> She had 10 Guns and 100 Men; another had 4 Guns and 80 Men: The re&s;t having no great Guns, had only 60 or 70 Men a|piece, armed with Mu&s;kets, and the Ve&s;&s;els barrica|doed round with Bull-hides Brea&s;t high. We had not above 50 Men in both Ships, 6 Guns in one and two in the other. A&s;&s;oon as we were over the Bar, we got our Larboard-Tacks aboard and &s;tood to the Ea&s;t|ward, as nigh the Wind as we could lye. The Spaniards came away quartering on us; and our Ship being the Head-mo&s;t, the <HI>Toro</HI> came directly towards us, de&s;igning to board us. We kept firing at her, in hopes to have lamed either Ma&s;t or Yard; but failing, ju&s;t as &s;he was &s;hearing aboard, we gave her a good Volley, and pre&s;ently clapp'd the Helm a Weather, wore our Ship, and got our Star|board Tacks aboard, and &s;tood to the We&s;tward; and &s;o left the <HI>Toro,</HI> but were &s;aluted by all the &s;mall Craft as we pa&s;t by them, who &s;tood to the Ea&s;tward after the <HI>Toro,</HI> that was now in pur&s;uit and clo&s;e by our Con&s;ort. We &s;tood to the We&s;tward
<PB N="130" REF="327">
till we were again&s;t the River's Mouth; then we tackt, and by the help of the Current that came out of the River, we were near a Mile to Wind-ward of them all. Then we made &s;ail to a&s;&s;i&s;t our Con&s;ort, who was hard put to it; but on our approach the <HI>Toro</HI> edged away towards the Shore, as did all the re&s;t, and &s;tood away for <HI>Alvarado:</HI> And we, glad of the Deliverance, went away to the Ea&s;tward, and vi&s;ited all the Rivers in our return again to <HI>Tri&s;t;</HI> and &s;earched the Bays for <HI>Munjack</HI> to carry with us for the Ship's u&s;e, as we had done before for the u&s;e both of Ships and Canoa's.</P>
<P><HI>Munjack</HI> is a &s;ort of Pitch or Bitumen, which we find in Lumps, from three or four pounds to thirty pounds in a lump; wa&s;hed up by the Sea, and left dry on all the Sandy-Bays on all this Coa&s;t: It is in Sub&s;tance like Pitch, but blacker; it melts by the Heat of the Sun, and runs abroad as Pitch would do if expo&s;ed, as this is, on the Bays: The &s;mell of it is not &s;o plea&s;ant as Pitch, neither does it &s;tick &s;o firmly as Pitch, but it is apt to peel off from the Seams of Ships Bottoms; however we find it very u&s;eful here where we want Pitch; and becau&s;e it is commonly mixed with Sand by lying on the Bays, we melt it and refine it very well before we u&s;e it; and commonly temper it with Oyl or Tallow to correct it; for though it melts by the heat of the Sun, yet it is of a har&s;her Nature than Pitch. I did never find the like in any other Part of the World, neither can I tell from whence it comes.</P>
<P>And now the Effects of the late Storm being almo&s;t forgot, the Lagune Men &s;ettled again to their Im|ployments; and I among the re&s;t fell to Work in the Ea&s;t Lagune, where I remained till my departure for <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="328">
I will only add as to this Logwood-Trade in ge|neral, that I take it to be one of the mo&s;t profitable to <HI>England,</HI> and it neare&s;t re&s;embles that of <HI>New|foundland;</HI> &s;ince what ari&s;es from both, is the pro|duct of bare Labour; and that the Per&s;ons imploy|ed herein are &s;upported by the Produce of their Na|tive Country.</P>
<P>It is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to determine how far we might have a right of cutting Wood there, but this I can &s;ay, that the Spaniards never receive le&s;s Da|mage from the Per&s;ons who generally follow that Trade, than when they are employed upon that Work.</P>
<P>While I was here the la&s;t time, Capt. <HI>Gibbs</HI> arriv'd in a Ship of about 100 Tuns, and brought with him 20 &s;tout <HI>New-England Indians</HI> that were taken in the Wars there, de&s;igning to have &s;old them at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> but not finding a good Market, brought them hither to cut Logwood, and hired one Mr. <HI>Richard Dawkins</HI> to be their Over&s;eer, who carried them to work at <HI>Summa&s;enta:</HI> But it &s;o happened that about a Week after, the Captain came thither in his Boat from <HI>One-Bu&s;h-Key</HI> where his Ship lay, and the Over&s;eer having &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s, de&s;ired leave to be ab&s;ent for two or three Days: But as &s;oon as he and the Seamen were gone, the Indians taking their Opportunity killed the Captain and marched off, de&s;igning to return to their own Country by Land: They were &s;een about a Month afterward, and one of them was taken near the River <HI>Tondelo.</HI></P>
<P>After I had &s;pent about ten or twelve Months at the Logwood Trade, and was grown pretty well acquainted with the way of Traffick here, I left the Imployment, yet with a de&s;ign to return hither af|ter I had been in <HI>England;</HI> and accordingly went from hence with Captain <HI>Chambers</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> bound to <HI>Jamaica.</HI> We &s;ailed from <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> the be|ginning
<PB N="132" REF="329">
ginning of <HI>April,</HI> 1678. and arrived at <HI>Jamaica</HI> in <HI>May,</HI> where I remained a &s;mall time, and then re|turned for <HI>England</HI> with Captain <HI>Leader</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> I arriv'd there the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the &s;ame Year: and at the beginning of the following Year, I &s;et out again for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> in order to have gone thence to <HI>Campeachy;</HI> but it proved to be a Voyage round the World, of which the Publick has already had an Account, in my former Volume, and the Fir&s;t Part of This.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Shall reduce what I have to &s;ay on this Sub|ject to &s;ome general Heads; beginning with the Trade-winds, as being the mo&s;t remark|able.</P>
<P>Trade-Winds are &s;uch as do blow con&s;tantly from one Point or Quarter of the Compa&s;s, and
<PB N="2" REF="335">
the Region of the World mo&s;t peculiar to them is from about 30 d. North, to 30 d. South of the Equator.</P>
<P>There are divers &s;orts of the&s;e Winds; &s;ome blowing from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, &s;ome from South to North, others from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, &amp;c. Some are con&s;tant in one Quarter all the Year; &s;ome blow one half the Year one way, and the other &s;ix Months quite contrary; and others blow &s;ix Months one way, and then &s;hifting only eight or ten Points, continue &s;ix Months more, and then return again to their former Stations, as all the&s;e &s;hifting Trade-Winds do; and &s;o as the Year comes about, they alternately &s;ucceed each other in their proper Sea&s;ons.</P>
<P>There are other &s;orts, called Sea-Winds and Land-winds, differing much from any of the for|mer, the one blowing by Day, the other by Night, con&s;tantly and regularly &s;ucceeding each other.</P>
<P>Within the Torrid Zone al&s;o are violent Storms, as fierce, if not fiercer, than any are in other Parts of the World. And as to the Sea&s;ons of the Year, I can di&s;tingui&s;h them there, no other way than by <HI>Wet</HI> and <HI>Dry;</HI> and the&s;e wet and dry Sea&s;ons do as &s;ucce&s;&s;ively follow each other, as Winter and Summer do with us.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o &s;trong Currents, &s;ometimes &s;etting one way, &s;ometimes another; which though it is hard to de&s;cribe, with that accuracy which is de&s;ir|able, yet I &s;hall give as particular an Account of them, as al&s;o of the &s;everal &s;orts of <HI>Winds,</HI> as my own Ob&s;ervations, and the Judicious Informations from others, will afford me Matter to do.</P>

<HEAD>Of the General Trade-Wind.</HEAD>
<P>Of all Winds before-mentioned, I &s;hall endea|vour to treat di&s;tinctly; beginning with the <HI>True</HI> Trade-VVind
<PB N="3" REF="336">
fir&s;t, which I call the <HI>General</HI> Trade-VVind at Sea; becau&s;e all other Trade-VVinds, whether con&s;tant or &s;hifting, &s;eem to have their dependance on &s;ome accidental Cau&s;e; whereas the Cau&s;e of the&s;e, be it what it will, &s;eems uniformand con&s;tant.</P>
<P>The&s;e General Trade-VVinds are only in the At|lantick Ocean which parts <HI>Africa</HI> from <HI>America,</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian</HI> Ocean, and in the <HI>Great South-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>In all the&s;e Seas, except ju&s;t under or near the Line, they con&s;tantly blow without Intermi&s;&s;ion, as well to the South, as to the North of the E|quator, but not with equal force at all Times, nor in all Latitudes; Neither do the&s;e con&s;tant Trade-VViuds u&s;ually blow near the &s;hoar, but only in the Ocean, at lea&s;t 30 or 40 Leagues off at Sea, clear from any Land; e&s;pecially on the VVe&s;t Coa&s;t, or &s;ide of any Continent: For indeed on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, The Ea&s;terly VVind being the true Trade-VVind, blows almo&s;t home to the &s;hore; &s;o near as to receive a check from the Land-VVind; and oft|times to admit of the Sea-Breez, by which it is drawn from its Cour&s;e frequently 4 or 5 Points of the Compa&s;s: But of the Sea-Breez I &s;hall &s;peak in its place. In &s;ome Places, and particularly the South Seas, in Sonth Lat. the true Ea&s;tern Trade <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s not found to blow within 150 or near 200 Leagues of the Coa&s;t, but in North Lat. in tho&s;e Seas, it comes within 30 or 40 Leagues di&s;tance of the Shore: And this I &s;hall give as a general Rule, That in North Lat. the&s;e VVinds are commonly at E. N. E. in South Lat. at E. S. E.</P>
<P>VVhen we go from <HI>England,</HI> and are bound to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> or <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> or to <HI>Guinea,</HI> we com|monly find the&s;e VVinds in the Lat. of 30d. &s;ome|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">imes &s;ooner, as in the Latitudes of 32 or 35. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> may &s;o happen that we may meet with an Ea&s;t|erly
<PB N="4" REF="337">
Wind in 40 d. or go out of our Channel with a North Ea&s;t Wind; which &s;ometimes al&s;o fails us not till we come into a true Trade-wind; but this is only accidental, therefore is not the Wind that I &s;peak of; but between 32 and 28 I did ne|ver know nor hear, that the true Trade-wind failed.</P>
<P>If in coming from <HI>England,</HI> we have a North Ea&s;terly Wind that brings us hither (<HI>i. e.</HI> into the true Trade-wind) it &s;ometimes &s;tays at North Ea&s;t, e&s;pecially if we keep near the <HI>African</HI> Shore, as <HI>Guinea</HI> Ships do, till we are near the Tropick of <HI>Cancer,</HI> and then comes to the E. N. E. where it &s;ettles; but commonly it &s;ettles there in 28 d. if we are &s;o far off Shore as to receive the true Trade. VVhen the VVind is thus &s;ettled, we have common|ly fair Weather, and a clear Sky, e&s;pecially if the Sun is in any Southern Sign; but if in a Northern Sign, the Weather is u&s;ually cloudy.</P>
<P>On the contrary, when we are in South Lat. in the Atlantick, if the Sun is in Northern Signs, the Sky is clear, but if in Southern Signs, the Sky is cloudy. This I once experienced to my &s;orrow, in my return from <HI>Bantam,</HI> in the Year 1671. VVe had cloudy VVeather and bri&s;k VVinds, while we were cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian</HI> Ocean and had a very good Pa&s;&s;age al&s;o about the <HI>Cape of good Hope;</HI> where we had fair clear VVeather; And &s;teering from thence, for the I&s;land St. <HI>Hellena,</HI> where we thought to VVater and refre&s;h, as all our <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India</HI> Ships do, we mi&s;t it for want of an <HI>Ob|&s;ervation.</HI> For before we came to the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> the Sky was again clouded, &s;o that we &s;eldom &s;aw the Sun or Stars, till we were quite pa&s;t the <HI>I&s;land.</HI> However we found the I&s;le of <HI>A&s;cention,</HI> where we &s;truck two Turtle, (for this was not the laying time, but the beginning of the <HI>Cooting</HI> or Ingendring Sea&s;on; therefore &s;ome few
<PB N="5" REF="338">
only were drawn hither.) This was the latter end of <HI>November.</HI> From the time that we thought our &s;elves to the VVe&s;t of St. <HI>Hellena,</HI> we had our VVa|ter mea&s;ured out to us, 2 Pints a Man <HI>per</HI> day, till we came into our Channel. This was the fir&s;t time that I began to know the value of fre&s;h VVater; for we took in none in all our way home from <HI>Ban|tam.</HI> But &s;o much for this Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The VVinds, as I &s;aid before, as we run to the Southward from <HI>England,</HI> do fir&s;t &s;ettle in the E. N. E. about the Lat. of 28d. or be &s;ure between that and 24d. e&s;pecially when the Sun is to the Southward of the Line; but in <HI>May, June</HI> and <HI>Ju|ly</HI> you will find the Winds at E. by S. or E. S. E.</P>
<P>The&s;e Winds, whether we meet them to the North of the Ea&s;t, or to the South of it, we find blowing a moderate Gale from our fir&s;t meeting them in 30 or 28d. till we come to the Tropick, there we find the Trade &s;tronger: It commonly blows a good Top&s;ail-gale, as we &s;ail large: And if we were to &s;ail on a Wind, our lower Sails would be enough.</P>
<P>The&s;e bri&s;k Gales blow in the Atlantick Ocean, and North of the Equator, from the Lat. of 23 to 12 or 14 con&s;tantly, between the E. N. E. and the E. but between 10 or 12 degrees and the Line, they are not &s;o fre&s;h nor con&s;tant, to that Point; for in the Months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the South Winds do oft times blow even to 11d. or 12d. of North Lat. keeping between the S. S. E. and the S. S. W. or S. W. but in <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January</HI> the true Trade blows within 3d. or 4d. of the Equator. And as the Sun returns again to the Northward, &s;o the Southerly Winds do increa&s;e and draw more to the Northward of the Line, till <HI>July,</HI> and them gradu|ally withdraw back again towards the Line: VVhen the Sun is in Southern Signs, 'tis the be&s;t time of the Year to cro&s;s the Line, if bound to the Southward;
<PB N="6" REF="339">
for be&s;ides the benefit of the true Trade, to bring a Ship near the Line, the Wind is then more con|&s;tant and fre&s;h, the Weather clearer, and the Winds which at other times are between the S. S. E. and S. S. W. are now at S. E. or S. E. and by E. but in our Summer Months we find nothing but Calms and Tornadoes; and tho' Tornadoes do u&s;ually ri&s;e again&s;t the &s;ettled Wind; yet but few Comman|ders will endeavour to take the Advantage of the Winds that come from them, but rather furl their Top&s;ails, hall up their Cor&s;es, and lye &s;till till the gu&s;t of Wind is pa&s;t, except nece&s;&s;ity requires ha&s;te; for the &s;udden Tornadoes do not continue long; and be&s;ides often very violent and fierce, &s;o that a Ship with her &s;ails loo&s;e, would be in danger to be over-&s;et by them, or at lea&s;t lo&s;e Ma&s;ts or Yards, or have the Sails &s;plit; be&s;ides the Con&s;ternation that all Men mu&s;t needs be in at &s;uch a time, e&s;pe|cially if the Ship, by any unfore&s;een accident, &s;hould prove unruly, as by the mi&s;take of the Man at Helm, or he that Conns, or by her broaching to again&s;t all endeavours, which often happens when a fierce gu&s;t comes; which tho' it does not la&s;t long, yet would do much damage in a &s;hort time; and tho' all things &s;hould fall out well, yet the be|nefit of it would not compen&s;ate the danger: For 'tis much if a Ship &s;ails a Mile before either the Wind dyes wholly away, or at lea&s;t &s;hifts about a|gain to the South. Nor are we &s;ure that the&s;e Winds will continue 3 Minutes before they &s;hift; and &s;ometimes they fly round fa&s;ter than the Ship will, tho' the Helm lies for it; and all Seamen know the danger of being taken a-back in &s;uch Weather.</P>
<P>But what has been &s;poken of the Southerly Winds, Calms, and Tornadoes is to be under&s;tood of the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Atlantick to as far We&s;t as the Longitude of 359d. or thereabouts; for far|ther We&s;terly we find the Winds commonly at S.
<PB N="7" REF="340">
E. even in cro&s;&s;ing the Line, and a very bri&s;k gale; 'tis for that rea&s;on our experienced <HI>Guinea</HI> Com|manders do keep to the Southward of the Line, till they are about that Longitude. Some run over nearer the <HI>American</HI> Shore before they cro&s;s the Line; Our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Commanders do al&s;o cro&s;s the Line, coming from <HI>India</HI> near the <HI>American</HI> Coa&s;t, and find bri&s;k Gales at S. E. all the times of the Year; but going to the <HI>Indies,</HI> they &s;teer away South, from the I&s;land St. <HI>Jago,</HI> where they com|monly Water and meet the Winds in that Longi|tude. But of this enough.</P>
<P>The Winds near the Line in the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean and South Sea are different from this, yet there the Winds are al&s;o Southerly and therefore different from what they are farther off, for 2 d. or 3d. on each &s;ide the Line, the Winds are commonly very uncertain, and oftentimes there are perfect Calms, or at lea&s;t very &s;mall Winds and &s;ome Tornadoes in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian</HI> Sea. In the <HI>South Seas,</HI> near and under the Line, the Winds are at South 130 Leagues off from the Shoar, but how farther off I know not; there the Winds are but &s;mall, yet con&s;tant, and the Weather clear from <HI>March</HI> till <HI>September;</HI> but about <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> there are Torna|does; yet in both the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian</HI> Sea, and the <HI>South Sea,</HI> the Winds near or under the Line, are often at South; yet the&s;e Winds do not blow above 2 or 3 d. to the North or South of the Line, except near &s;ome Land; but in the Atlantick Sea, as I have &s;aid before, the South and South We&s;t Winds do &s;ome|times blow even to 10 or 12 d. North of the Line. And for the South Winds to blow con&s;tantly near the Line in the Atlantick, between <HI>Cape Verd</HI> in <HI>Afri|ca,</HI> and <HI>C. Blanco</HI> in <HI>Brazil,</HI> is no wonderful thing, if a Man will but con&s;ider tho&s;e Promontories that &s;hoot out from the Continents on each &s;ide the Sea; one on the North, the other on the South &s;ide of the Equa|tor,
<PB N="8" REF="341">
leaving but a &s;mall &s;pace clear for the Winds to blow in; where there is always a pretty bri&s;k Gale, e&s;pecially on the <HI>American</HI> &s;ide. And as within 2 or 3 d. of the Equator, it is mo&s;t &s;ubject to Calms and Tornadoes and &s;mall faint Breezes in other Seas not pend up as this is. So this Sea, except ju&s;t in the very opening between both Promonto|ries, is much more &s;ubject to it than any other, e|&s;pecially on the Ea&s;t &s;ide: that is, from the Bite or the Inland corner of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea</HI> to 28 or 30 d. di&s;tance We&s;t: But this &s;eems not to be alto|gether the effects of the Line, but owing partly to the nearne&s;s of the Land to the Line, which &s;hoots out from the Bite of <HI>Guinea,</HI> even to <HI>Cape St. Anns,</HI> almo&s;t in a parallel with the Equator (allowing for the Bays and Bendings) and this is 23 or 24 d. of Longitude, and not above 80 Leagues from the Line in &s;ome Places: So that this part of the Sea between the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and the Line or 2 d. South of it, lying, as it were, between the Land and the Line, is &s;eldom free from bad Weather; e&s;pecially from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>September;</HI> but when the Sun is withdrawn towards the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> then there is &s;omething better Weather there.</P>
<P>And in the Sea under the Line between the <HI>Afri|can</HI> Promontory and the <HI>American,</HI> it is free from Tornadoes and Calms, and more &s;ubject to fair Weather and fre&s;h Breezes. Therefore both our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships, when outward|bound, endeavour to Cro&s;s the Line as near as they can in the mid Channel, between both Promon|tories; and although they meet the Winds &s;ome times at S. S. E. or at S. S. W. or farther Ea&s;terly or VVe&s;terly; yet will they not run above a de|gree to the Ea&s;t, or a degree to the VVe&s;t of the mid Channel, before they tack again, for fear of meeting with the &s;oaking Current on the VVe&s;t, or Calms on the Ea&s;t &s;ide; either of which would be alike prejudicial to their Cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="342">
The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> in their Voyages to <HI>Brazil,</HI> take the &s;ame method, and get to the South of the Line before they fall in with the Land, for fear of fal|ling to leward of <HI>Cape St. Augu&s;tine,</HI> for there are &s;o many things which make that a difficult Cape to pa&s;s, that hardly any Man would try to do it, but at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>But our <HI>Guinea</HI> Ships do generally pa&s;s on to their Ports on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> at any time of the Year, without u&s;ing &s;uch Methods; becau&s;e their Bu&s;ine&s;s lies mo&s;tly on the North of the Line, where they always find a fair VVe&s;terly VVind. But in their returns from thence, they cro&s;s the Line, and run 3 or 4d. to the Southward of it, where they meet the Wind between the S. S. E. and the S. S. W. and a bri&s;k gale: with this VVind, they run away in the &s;ame parallel 35 or 36 d. before they cro&s;s the Line again to the Northward, which is about midway between the Extreams of both Pro|montories, there they find a bri&s;k gale, which car|ries them to the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> or where they plea&s;e. Some run VVe&s;t 40 d. before they cro&s;s the Line, and find &s;trong Gales; whereas &s;hould they come from <HI>Old Callabar,</HI> or any other Place in the <HI>Bite,</HI> on the North of the Line, and &s;teer away VVe&s;t, thinking to gain their Pa&s;&s;age the &s;ooner becau&s;e it is the neare&s;t way, they would doubtle&s;s be mi|&s;taken, as many Men have been: For if they keep near the Line, they meet with great Calms; and if they keep near the Land, they meet with VVe&s;terly VVinds; and if they keep in the middle between both, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity meet with both Incon|veniencies, as al&s;o with Tornadoes, e&s;pecially in <HI>May, June, July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>By which means &s;ome Ships, if they go any of the&s;e three ways now cautioned again&s;t, &s;pend more time in going from the <HI>Bite</HI> to <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> than ano|ther Ship will do if it cro&s;s the Line in the right
<PB N="10" REF="343">
Places before-mentioned, in going to the <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes unexperienced <HI>Guinea</HI> Ma&s;ters in their return from thence, after they have cro&s;s'd the Line from N. to S. and are in a fair way to gain a &s;peedy Pa&s;&s;age, will be &s;o ob&s;tinate in their Opini|ons, after they have run 26, 28 or 30 d. We&s;t from <HI>Old Callabar</HI> (with a fair Wind) to &s;teer away W. by N. or W. N. W. it being the directe&s;t Cour&s;e they can &s;teer for <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> then they mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity keep within a degree of the Line, while they are running 2 or 300 Leagues, which may prove to be a long time in doing, becau&s;e of the uncertainty of the Winds near the Equator; therefore they that cro&s;s it near the middle, between both Pro|montories, or near the <HI>American</HI> Coa&s;t, when they are minded to fall away to the Northward, &s;teer away N. W. or N. W. by N. and &s;o depre&s;s or rai&s;e a degree in running 28 Leagues at mo&s;t; therefore (which is be&s;t) they are but a &s;hort time near the Equator: And be&s;ides, in thus cro&s;&s;ing it in the middle between both Promontories, they &s;eldom mi&s;s of a Wind: for the Wind in the&s;e Seas has no other Pa&s;&s;age, but between the&s;e two Promonto|ries.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid already on this Head, has been chiefly of the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> and of that too mo&s;tly about the Line, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t difficult Place to pa&s;s in going to the Southward. In other Seas, as in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Sea,</HI> and the <HI>Great South Sea</HI> there is no &s;uch difficulty to pa&s;s any way, becau&s;e there is Sea-room enough, with|out coming into &s;uch Inconveniencies, as we meet with in the Atlantick; and as to the Winds be|tween the Line and the Tropicks, in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian Sea</HI> and the <HI>South Sea,</HI> they are in their Latitudes, as I &s;aid before, <HI>viz.</HI> in South Latitude, at E. S. E and in North Lat. at E. N. E. blowing con&s;tantly fre&s;h Breezes, e&s;pecially in the South Seas, even
<PB N="11" REF="344">
from within a degree or two of the Line, on each &s;ide to the Tropick, or to 30 degrees of Lat. And this I may truly &s;ay, That neither the Atlantick nor the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian Seas</HI> have the true Trade-Winds &s;o con&s;tant nor bri&s;k at all times of the Year, and in all Latitudes, as they are here. For being once got in the Trade, I mean without the verge of the coa&s;ting Trade-Wind, it blows a very bri&s;k gale all over the Ocean. Capt. <HI>Eaton</HI> experienced this in &s;ailing from the <HI>Gallapagos</HI> I&s;lands to the <HI>Ladrones,</HI> in the latter end of the Year 1685. We had the like experience, &s;ailing from <HI>Cape Corientes</HI> to <HI>Guam</HI> the Year after (as ap|pears by my Journal of that Run, in my Voyage round the World. Chap. 10. Pag. 185.) And as for the Wind to the Southward of the Line, I had great Experience of it in my ramble there with Capt. <HI>Sharp;</HI> and &s;ince that Capt. <HI>Davis,</HI> in his return out of the South Sea, had greater Experi|ence, becau&s;e he took his departure from the <HI>Gal|lapagos</HI> I&s;lands al&s;o, and &s;teering W. S. W. from thence, till he met the True Trade at E. S. E. he &s;teered directly South, clear from the Line, till he got to the Southward of the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> and &s;o quite without the Trade.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian</HI> Sea, between the Lat of 30 d. and 4 degrees South of the Equator, the true Breez is at E. S. E. or S. E. by E. yet not &s;o con&s;tant nor bri&s;k as in the South Seas; be&s;ides that part of it which lyes to the Northward of the Line, has not &s;uch a con&s;tant &s;teady Breez, but is more &s;ubject to Calms, and near the &s;hoar to &s;hifting Winds, ac|cording to the Sea&s;ons of the Year.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the con&s;tant coasting Trade-Winds.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Parallel of the South Part of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI> The Trade-Winds blowwith an acute Angle on any Coa&s;t. The Winds about <HI>Angola</HI> and in the South Seas alike; as al&s;o at <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Guinea.</HI> The Winds &s;hift not in &s;ome Pla|ces. Sand blown from the Shore about <HI>Cape Blanco</HI> in <HI>Guinea</HI> An Account of the Trade-Winds from thence to <HI>Cape Logos.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Trade-winds which blow on any Coa&s;t, are either Con&s;tant or Shift|ing.</P>
<P>The Coa&s;ts that are &s;ubject to Con&s;tant Trade-winds, are, the South Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> and part of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and part of <HI>Gui|nea.</HI></P>
<P>The South part of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> are in one Lat. both Coa&s;ts trending North and South; both on the We&s;t &s;ide of their Continents; both in South Lat. and tho' they do not lye exactly parallel, by Rea&s;on of &s;ome Capes or Bendings in the Land, yet are the Winds much alike on both Coa&s;ts, all the Year long.</P>
<P>On the Coa&s;t of <HI>Angola</HI> the Winds are between the S. VV. and S. And on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru,</HI> we rec|kon them between the S. S. VV. and S. S. E. But this the Reader mu&s;t take notice of, That the Trade-winds that blow on any Coa&s;t, except the North Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> whether they are con&s;tant, and
<PB N="13" REF="346">
blow all the Year, or whether they are &s;hifting VVinds, do never blow right in on the Shoar, nor right along Shoar; but go &s;lanting, making an accute Angle of about 22 degrees. Therefore as the Land trends more Ea&s;terly or VVe&s;terly from the North or South on the&s;e Coa&s;ts, &s;o the VVinds do alter accordingly; as for example, where the Land lies N. and S. the VVind would be at S. S. VV. but where the Land lies S. S. W. the Trade would be at S. VV. But if the Land lies S. S. E. then the Wind would be at South. This is &s;uppo&s;ed of Coa&s;ts lying on the VVe&s;t &s;ide of any Continent, and on the South &s;ide of the Equator, as the two Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> are; but the North part of <HI>Africa</HI> has the Trade blowing off from the &s;hoar, two or three Points.</P>
<P>The&s;e Southerly VVinds do blow con&s;tantly all the Year long, on both the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>A|frica;</HI> they are bri&s;k, and blow farther off from the Coa&s;ts than any &s;hifting Winds.</P>
<P>On the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru,</HI> the&s;e VVinds blow 140 or 150 Leagues off Shore, before you can perceive them to alter; But then as you run farther off, &s;o the Wind will come about more Ea&s;terly, and at about 200 Leagues di&s;tance it &s;ettles at E. S. E. which is the true Trade.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Angola</HI> and <HI>Brazil</HI> the Winds are much as they are in the South Seas, on the We&s;t &s;ide of the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Coa&s;t; only near the Line, within 4 degrees of it, in South Lat. the Wind holds in the S. S. W. or S. W. for 28 or 30 d. of Longitude, and &s;o it may in the &s;ame Lat. in the South Seas, for ought I know; for it was at South, as far as any of us were, which was 200 Leagues.</P>
<P>As the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Angola</HI> have their con|&s;tant Trade-winds, &s;o has the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Guinea.</HI> And as the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru</HI> lies North and South, &s;o tho&s;e lye nearer Ea&s;t and We&s;t.
<PB N="14" REF="347">
According to the Cour&s;e of the general Trade the Winds &s;hould be Ea&s;terly on the&s;e Coa&s;ts; but here we meet with the quite contrary; for from the Lat. of 10 d. North to 20 d. North on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexico,</HI> the Winds are con&s;tantly near the We&s;t on all the Coa&s;t, except check'd &s;ometimes with Tornadoes, which do commonly ri&s;e again&s;t the Wind, the &s;ame is ob&s;erved on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ango|la;</HI> where there are Tornadoes al&s;o: But the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru</HI> is not &s;ubject to any, yet on that Coa&s;t there are &s;ometimes Calms two or three days together off of the Bay of <HI>Arica,</HI> between the Lat. of 16 and 23. In the Lat. of 19 you &s;hall have Calms 30 or 40 Leagues off Shore, but not &s;o far on either &s;ide the Bay, neither are &s;uch Calms u&s;ual on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Angola</HI> and <HI>Mexico</HI> only after a Tornado, as is common in other Places.</P>
<P>As the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Angola</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> do in mo&s;t things run parallel each with other; &s;o do the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Guinea:</HI> And if I am not mi|&s;taken, the VVinds on both the&s;e Coa&s;ts are much alike; Both the&s;e Coa&s;ts do begin at the Bite or Bending of the Land, where the other two Parallel Lands do end; for as the <HI>Mexican</HI> Continent be|gins at or near <HI>Panama,</HI> which is 8 or 9 degrees North of the Equator; &s;o that part of <HI>Guinea,</HI> which I &s;peak of, begins about <HI>Old Callabar,</HI> in about 4 or 5 degrees of North Lat.</P>
<P>The Land trends away VVe&s;terly from both the&s;e Places &s;ome hundreds of Leagues; and tho' not on one Point of the Compa&s;s, becau&s;e of the &s;mall Points, Bays and Bending in the Land, yet the VVinds that on more regular Shores, keep their con&s;tant Cour&s;e, and blow in upon the Shore, about two Points from the Sea, do al&s;o here on the <HI>Guinea</HI> Coa&s;t, blow on the Shore from the VVe&s;t Quarter, and as the Land lies pointing in on the Shore, even from <HI>Cape Mount</HI> to <HI>Old Callabar,</HI> which is above

400 Leagues; and that with &s;uch con&s;tancy that the Ea&s;t part of that Coa&s;t is called the <HI>Leeward Coa&s;t;</HI> and the We&s;t part the <HI>Windward Coa&s;t;</HI> And yet this is &s;o contrary to the general Opinion of Seamen, concerning the Cour&s;e of the Winds, that nothing but their own Experience will con|vince them of the Truth of it; for thus they gene|rally rea&s;on; <HI>Barbadoes</HI> is the Ea&s;ter-mo&s;t of the <HI>Carribbe</HI>-I&s;lands, therefore the re&s;t are &s;aid be to Leeward of it, and &s;o of any other I&s;land; as in|deed it u&s;ually holds true, becau&s;e the Winds there are commonly at Ea&s;t; but this Counter Wind on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea</HI> a&s;toni&s;hes mo&s;t Seamen that have &s;een nothing like what they meet with here.

<P>But that part of <HI>Africa,</HI> which lies between <HI>Cape Verd</HI> in 14d. North, and <HI>Cape Bayedore</HI> in 27. has commonly Northerly Winds; or between the N. and N.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Coa&s;ts where the VVinds do u&s;ually &s;hift, are &s;ome in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> as that part of the Coa&s;t between <HI>Cape Gratia de Dios,</HI> and <HI>Cape La Vera</HI> chiefly: The Coa&s;t of <HI>Brazil;</HI> the Bay of <HI>Panama</HI> in the South Seas, and all the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> even from the River <HI>Natal,</HI> which is in the Lat. of 30d.

<PB N="18" REF="351">
&s;o orderly, or certain as the <HI>Mon&s;oons</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> or the &s;hifting Winds on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra|zil.</HI></P>
<P>The Common Trade-Wind on this Coa&s;t is be|tweea the N. E. and the Ea&s;t; This Trade blows con&s;tantly from <HI>March</HI> till <HI>November,</HI> but is often check'd with Tornadoes in the Months of <HI>May, June, July,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> e&s;pecially between the Ri|ver of <HI>Darien</HI> and <HI>Co&s;tarica;</HI> but to Wind-ward there is a more &s;erene Air, and a brisker Wind: From <HI>October</HI> till <HI>March</HI> there are We&s;terly Winds, not con&s;tant, nor violent, but blowing moderately &s;ometimes 2 or 3 Days or a Week; and then the Breez may blow again as long. The&s;e VVinds are mo&s;t in <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January;</HI> before and after the&s;e two Months the Trade-VVind is only check'd a Day or two near the full or change of the Moon; and when the VVe&s;terly VVinds blow longe&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t on the Coa&s;t, the Ea&s;terly Trade-wind blows off at Sea, as at other times. Near <HI>Cape La Vela,</HI> the true Trade blows within 8 or 10 Leagues off the Shore, when the We&s;terly Winds blow on the Coa&s;t, except in a &s;trong North, which turns the Trade-Wind back, and on the <HI>Co&s;torica,</HI> and between it and the River <HI>Darien,</HI> the We&s;terly Winds, as they are more frequent and la&s;ting, than toward <HI>Cape La Vela,</HI> &s;o al&s;o they blow farther of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> at Sea, as &s;ometimes as far as to 20 or 30 Leagues from the Shore.</P>
<P>Therefore Ships bound to Windward, if they have far to go, either take the opportunity of the We&s;terly Wind-Sea&s;on, or el&s;e go through the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> and &s;tretch away to the North, till they get into a variable Winds way, and then run to the Ea&s;tward as far as they think conveni|ent before they &s;tretch to the Southward again. All that are bound from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> to <HI>Guinea</HI> mu&s;t take this cour&s;e, if they &s;ail from <HI>Jamaica</HI> (becau&s;e
<PB N="19" REF="352">
they mu&s;t pa&s;s thro' the Gulph of <HI>Florida</HI>) but from other I&s;lands they may &s;tretch away directly to the North, and u&s;e the &s;ame method.</P>
<P>But if Ships have only a &s;mall way to Sail to Wind-ward, they make u&s;e of the Sea and Land Breezes, making no account of the time of the Year.</P>
<P>The Winds on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Brazil,</HI> are from <HI>September</HI> till <HI>March</HI> at E. N. E. and from <HI>March</HI> till <HI>September</HI> again they are at South.</P>
<P>The Winds in the Bay of <HI>Panama</HI> are from <HI>September</HI> till <HI>March</HI> Ea&s;terly, and from <HI>March</HI> till <HI>September</HI> again they are at S. and S. S. W.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Cape of good Hope</HI> Ea&s;twards, as far as the River <HI>Natal,</HI> which lies in 30 d. South Latitude, and <HI>Cape Corientes</HI> in Lat. of 24 degrees South, the Winds from <HI>May</HI> to <HI>October</HI> are con&s;tantly from the We&s;t to the North We&s;t within 30 Leagues of the Shore: They blow harde&s;t at North We&s;t. When the Wind comes to North We&s;t, it is common|ly &s;tormy and tempe&s;tuous Weather, attended with much Rain, and then the Weather is cold and chil|ly. From <HI>October</HI> till <HI>March</HI> the Winds are Ea|&s;terly from the E. N. E. to the E. S. E. you have then very fair Weather: The E. N. E. Winds are pretty fre&s;h, but the Winds at E. S. E. are &s;mall and faint, &s;ometimes affording &s;ome drops of Rain.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cape Corientes</HI> to the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> from <HI>October</HI> till the middle of <HI>January</HI> the Winds are variable, but mo&s;t times Northerly, and oft &s;hifting round the Compa&s;s: The &s;tronge&s;t Winds are at North; the&s;e are often very violent and &s;tormy, and ac|companied with much Rain, and thus it blows about the I&s;land of <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> and the adjacent I&s;lands.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;torms are commonly preceded by a great Sea out of the North. From <HI>January</HI> till <HI>May</HI> the Winds are at N. E. or N. N. E. &s;ine fre&s;h gales and

fair VVeather. From <HI>May</HI> till <HI>October</HI> the VVind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> are Southerly, in <HI>July, Augu&s;t</HI> and <HI>September</HI> then are great Calms in the Bay of <HI>Pate</HI> and <HI>Melende,</HI> and a &s;trong Current &s;etting into the Bay: There|fore Ships that have occa&s;ion to pa&s;s this way in tho&s;e three Months, ought to keep at lea&s;t 100 Leagues from the Coa&s;t to avoid being driven by the Cur|rent into the Bay; for the&s;e Calms do &s;ometimes la&s;t 6 Weeks, yet off at Sea, at the di&s;tance of 100 Leagues the Winds are fre&s;h a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> South. At the entrance into the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> near <HI>Cape Guardefuer</HI> there are commonly very hard gales and turbulent Weather, even when the Calms are &s;o great in the Bay of <HI>Melende,</HI> and not above 10 or 12 Leagues at Sea from the &s;aid <HI>Cape,</HI> there is al&s;o very fair Weather, and pretty fre&s;h Gales.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> from <HI>May</HI> till <HI>October,</HI> the Winds are &s;trong at S.

In the Months of <HI>September</HI> or <HI>October,</HI> the VVind &s;huffles about to the North, and at la&s;t &s;ettles at N.

<P>The Account of this Coa&s;t from the <HI>Cape of good Hope</HI> hither, I had from Capt. <HI>Rogers.</HI></P>

<PB N="21" REF="354">
and Ea&s;twards as far as <HI>Japan,</HI> the &s;hifting Trade-Winds do alternately &s;ucceed each other as duly as the Year comes about.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Trade-Wind in all the&s;e Places, &s;hould be exactly on one Point of the Compa&s;s: For I have already &s;hown, that the&s;e Trade-Winds on any Coa&s;t do commonly blow &s;lanting in on the Shore about 2 or 3 Points; therefore in Bays where the Land lies on &s;everal Rombs, the Winds mu&s;t alter accordingly. Tho' that Rule does not hold altogether true in Bays that are deep, but is chiefly meant for a pretty &s;treight Coa&s;t, which lies near alike; allowing for Points of Land and &s;mall Coves, which make no alteration: But on the &s;ides and in the bottom of large Bays, &s;uch as the Bay of <HI>Bengall,</HI> the Bay of <HI>Siam,</HI> &amp;c. the VVind differs much on one &s;ide of the Bay from what it does on the other; and both &s;ides differ from the con&s;tant Trade on the open Coa&s;t; yet all &s;hift in the &s;hifting Sea&s;ons, which are <HI>April</HI> and <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> at one and the &s;ame time, to their oppo&s;ite Points: I mean on the open Coa&s;t, for in &s;ome Bays there is a little alteration from that general Rule.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;hifting VVinds in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> are cal|led <HI>Mon&s;oons;</HI> one is called the Ea&s;t <HI>Mon&s;oon,</HI> the other the VVe&s;t <HI>Mon&s;oon.</HI> The Ea&s;t <HI>Mon&s;oon</HI> &s;ets in about <HI>September</HI> and blows till <HI>April;</HI> then cea&s;eth, and the VVe&s;t <HI>Mon&s;oon</HI> takes place and blows till <HI>September</HI> again.</P>
<P>And both the Ea&s;t and VVe&s;t <HI>Mon&s;oons</HI> blow in their Sea&s;ons &s;lanting in on the Coa&s;t, as is before de&s;cribed: The Ea&s;t <HI>Mon&s;oon</HI> brings fair VVeather; the VVe&s;t brings Tornadoes and Rain. For, (as I &s;aid before in the fir&s;t Chap. of the General Trade-VVind at Sea) when the Sun comes to the North of the Linethen all Places North of the Equator, with|in the Tropicks, are troubled with Clouds and Rain, but when the Sun is in Southern Signs then the Sky is
<PB N="22" REF="355">
clear. And as mo&s;t of the Trading Countries in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e on the Main Conti|nent, do lye between the Line and the Tropick of <HI>Cancer:</HI> So the&s;e Countries are all &s;ubject to the Chan|ges and Sea&s;ons already de&s;cribed. But the I&s;lands lying under the Line, and to the South between the Line and the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> have contrary Sea|&s;ons to the&s;e. Yet do they change at the &s;elf-&s;ame time.</P>
<P>The difference between the <HI>Mon&s;oons</HI> on the North of the Line, and the <HI>Mon&s;oons</HI> on the South of the Line is that in <HI>April,</HI> when the We&s;t <HI>Mon|&s;oon</HI> &s;ets in to the North of the Line, the S. S. W. VVinds &s;ets in to the South of the Lat. and is called the S. S. VV. <HI>Mon&s;oon.</HI> And in <HI>September</HI> when the Ea&s;t <HI>Mon&s;oon</HI> &s;ets in to the North of the Line, the N. N. E. VVind blows in South Lat. and is called the N. N. E. <HI>Mon&s;oon.</HI> And whereas the We&s;t <HI>Mon&s;oon</HI> is accompanied with Tornadoes and Rain in North Lat. the S. S. W. <HI>Mon&s;oon,</HI> which blows at the &s;ame time in South Lat. is accompanied with fair Wea|ther. And as the Ea&s;t <HI>Mon&s;oon</HI> is attended with fair Weather in North Lat. the N. N. E. <HI>Mon&s;oon,</HI> which blows at the &s;ame time in South Lat is attended with Tornadoes and very bad Weather. And tho' the&s;e Winds do not &s;hift exactly at one time in all Years; yet <HI>Sept.</HI> and <HI>Apr.</HI> are always accounted the turning Months, and do commonly participate of both &s;orts of Winds. For the&s;e <HI>Mon&s;oons</HI> do as con&s;tantly &s;hift by turns, as the Year comes about. And by means of this change of Wind, Ships have the be|nefit to &s;ail from one part of <HI>India,</HI> with one Wind, and return with the contrary: So that mo&s;t of the Navigation in <HI>India</HI> depends on the <HI>Mon&s;oons.</HI> And Ships do con&s;tantly wait for the&s;e Changes; and the Merchants fit out to any Place according as the Sea|&s;on of the Year draws on: And where&s;oever they go they certainly di&s;patch their bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o as to re|turn
<PB N="23" REF="356">
back again with the next or contrary <HI>Mon&s;oon:</HI> For here is no &s;ailing to and from any Place, but with the <HI>Mon&s;oon;</HI> One carries them out, the other brings them back. Neither do I know how it were po&s;&s;ible for Merchants in the&s;e Parts to Trade by Sea from one Country to another, were it not for the&s;e &s;hifting <HI>Mon&s;oons.</HI> For, as I have &s;aid before, mo&s;t of the Trading Kingdoms in <HI>India</HI> do lye be|tween the Line, and the Tropick of <HI>Cancer.</HI> And the Land lies &s;o to the North, that Ships cannot go to the North of the Tropick, and by that means get into variable Winds way; as they may and do in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> when they are bound far to the Ea&s;t|ward. Neither could it be any advantage to &s;tand off to Sea, as they may in the South Sea; for that would be of little moment, becau&s;e they would then come &s;o near the Line, that they would be al|ways lyable to Tornadoes and Calms; and &s;hould they cro&s;s the Line and run to the Southward of it, thinking that way to gain their Pa&s;&s;age, it is likely they might &s;ucceed no better there: For that part of the Sea which lies to the Southward of the Line is open and free to the true Trade, which &s;eldom fails: But indeed that Wind would carry them to the Southward quite beyond the Trade into a variable VVinds-way. But the Sea is not open there, for Ships to pa&s;s &s;o far to the Ea&s;tward as to gain their Ports.</P>
<P>For our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships that are bound to <HI>Siam, Tunqueen, China,</HI> &amp;c. cannot get thither but in the Sea&s;on of the We&s;t <HI>Mon&s;oon,</HI> tho' they go direct|ly from <HI>England;</HI> and though, after they are pa&s;t the <HI>Cape,</HI> they have the convenience to &s;tretch to the Ea&s;tward, as far as the Land will permit, yet they cannot go &s;o far as is convenient before they will be obliged to &s;teer down within the Cour&s;e of the Trade-Winds, which would ob&s;truct their Pa&s;&s;age, if they were as con&s;tant here as in other Places. And therefore if the&s;e Anniver|&s;ary

<P>In the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> we have the&s;e helps of Land-Winds and Sea-Breezes by which we &s;ail from one place to another, provided they are no great di|&s;tance a&s;under, and perform our Voyages well e|nough; but when we are to &s;ail a great way to the Ea&s;tward again&s;t the Trade-Wind, then we are for|ced, as is &s;aid before, either to pa&s;s thro' the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> if we are far to Leeward, or el&s;e to pa&s;s between the I&s;lands, and &s;o &s;tretch away to the Northward, till we are clear out of the Trade, and &s;o get our Longitude that way.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SEA-Breezes, generally &s;peaking, are no other than the Common Trade-Wind of the Coa&s;ts on which they blow, with this differ|ence, that whereas all Trade-Winds, whether they are tho&s;e that I call the general Trade-Winds at Sea, or coa&s;ting Trade-Winds, either con&s;tant or &s;hifting, do blow as well by Night as by Day, with an equal bri&s;kne&s;s, except when Tornadoes happen; So contrarily Sea-Winds are only in the Day, and cea&s;e in the Night; and as all Trade-Winds blow con&s;tantly near to one Point of the Compa&s;s, both where the con&s;tant Trade-Winds are, or where they &s;hift; on the contrary the&s;e Sea-Winds do dif|fer from them in this, that in the Morning when they fir&s;t &s;pring up, they blow commonly as the Trade-Winds on the Coa&s;t do, at or near the
<PB N="27" REF="360">
&s;ame Point of Compa&s;s; but about Mid-Day they fly off 2, 3 or 4 Points further from the Land, and &s;o blow almo&s;t right in on the Coa&s;t, e&s;pecially in fair Weather; for then the Sea-Breezes are true&s;t; as for in&s;tance, on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Argola</HI> the Land lies almo&s;t North and South, there the Trade-Wind is from the S. S. W. to the S. W. the true Sea-Breezes near the &s;hore are at W. by S. or W. S. W. and &s;o of any other Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e Sea-Breezes do commonly ri&s;e in the Mor|ning about Nine a Clock, &s;ometimes &s;ooner, &s;ome|times later: they fir&s;t approach the &s;hore, &s;o gent|ly, as if they were afraid to come near it, and of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|times they make &s;ome faint breathings, and as if not willing to offend, they make a halt, and &s;eem ready to retire. I have waited many a time both a&s;hore to receive the plea&s;ure, and at Sea to take the benefit of it.</P>
<P>It comes in a fine, &s;mall, black Curle upon the Water, when as all the Sea between it and the &s;hore not yet reach'd by it, is as &s;mooth and even as Gla&s;s in Compari&s;on; in half an Hour's time after it has reached the &s;hore it fans pretty bri&s;kly, and &s;o increa&s;eth gradually till 12 a Clock, then it is commonly &s;tronge&s;t, and la&s;ts &s;o till 2 or 3 a very bri&s;k gale; about 12 at Noon it al&s;o veers off to Sea 2 or 3 Points, or more in very fair Weather. After 3 a Clock it begins to dye away again, and gradually withdraws its force till all is &s;pent, and about 5 a Clock, &s;ooner or later, according as the Weather is, it is lull'd a&s;leep, and comes no more till the next Morning.</P>
<P>The&s;e Winds are as con&s;tantly expected as the day in their proper Latitudes, and &s;eldom fail but in the wet Sea&s;on. On all Coa&s;ts of the Main, whethre in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> or <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> or <HI>Guinea,</HI> they ri&s;e in the Morning, and withdraw towards the Evening, yet
<PB N="28" REF="361">
Capes and Head-Lands have the greate&s;t benefit of them, where they are highe&s;t, ri&s;e earlier, and blow later.</P>
<P>Bays contrarily have the di&s;advantage, for there they blow but faintly at be&s;t, and their continuance is but &s;hort. I&s;lands that lye neare&s;t Ea&s;t and We&s;t, have the benefit of the&s;e Winds on both &s;ides equal|ly; for if the Wind is at S. W. or S. W. and by S. on the South &s;ide of any I&s;land, then on the North &s;ide it would be at N. W. or N. W. by N. <HI>i. e.</HI> in fair Weather; but if turbulent Weather it would be E. S. E. on the South&s;ide, and E. N. E. on the other: But this true Sea Breez does not veer &s;o far out, except only near the &s;hore, as about 3 or 4 Leagues di&s;tant; for farther than that, you will find only the right Coa&s;ting Trade-Wind. This I have experienced in &s;everal Parts of the World, particularly at <HI>Jamaica;</HI> about which I have made many Voyages, both on the North and the South &s;ide, where I have experienced the Sea-Breezes ve|ry much to differ; for on the South &s;ide I have found the true Sea-Wind after 12 a Clock, and in very fair Weather at S. or S. S. E. though it &s;prung up in the Morning at E. S. E. or S. E. And on the North &s;ide I have found the Sea-Breeze at N. or N. N. E. though it ro&s;e in the Morning at E. N. E. but whether there may be the like difference about &s;maller I&s;lands, as at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> &amp;c. I cannot deter|mine, tho' I am apt to believe there is not. So much far the Sea-Winds, next of the Land-Breezes.</P>
<P>Land Breezes are as remarkable as any Winds that I have yet treated of; they are quite contrary to the Sea-Breezes; for tho&s;e blow right from the &s;hore, but the Sea-Breez right in upon the &s;hore; and as the Sea-Breezes do blow in the Day and re&s;t in the Night; &s;o on the contrary, the&s;e do blow in the Night and re&s;t in the Day, and &s;o they do alter|nately
<PB N="29" REF="362">
&s;ucceed each other. For when the Sea-Breezes have performed their Offices of the Day, by brea|thing on their re&s;pective Coa&s;ts, they in the Evening do either withdraw from the Coa&s;t, or lye down to re&s;t: Then the Land-VVinds, who&s;e Office is to be breath in the Night, moved by the &s;ame order of Divine Impul&s;e, do rouze out of their private re|ce&s;&s;es and gently fan the Air till the next Morning; and then their ta&s;k ends and they leave the Stage.</P>
<P>There can be no proper time &s;et when they do begin in the Evening, or when they retire in the Morning, for they do not keep to an hour; but they commonly &s;pring up between 6 and 12 in the Evening, and la&s;t till 6, 8, or 10 in the Morning. They both come and go away again earlier or la|ter, according to the VVeather, the Sea&s;on of the Year, or &s;ome accidental Cau&s;e from the Land: For on &s;ome Coa&s;ts they do ri&s;e earlier, blow fre|&s;her, and remain later than on other Coa&s;ts, as I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter.</P>
<P>They are called Land-VVinds, becau&s;e they blow off &s;hore contrary to the Sea-Breez, which way &s;o|ever the Coa&s;t lies: Yet I would not &s;o be under|&s;tood, as if the&s;e VVinds are only found to breathe near the &s;hores of any Land, and not in the Inland Parts of &s;uch Countries remote from the Sea; for in my Travels I have found them in the very heart of the Countries that I have pa&s;&s;ed through; as particularly on the I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien,</HI> and the I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica:</HI> Both which places I have tra|velled over from Sea to Sea; yet becau&s;e the&s;e are but &s;mall Tracts of Land in compari&s;on with the two main Bodies of Land of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> and tho&s;e va&s;t Regions in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> lying within the Tro|picks, I cannot determine whether the Land-VVinds are there, as I have fonnd them in my &s;mall Travels: therefore I &s;hall only confine this particular Di&s;|cour&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="363">
to the&s;e and other Places within my ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ob&s;ervations. I &s;hall begin fir&s;t with the I&s;thmu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Darien;</HI> there I have found the Land-Winds it the middle of the Country blowing all Night, and till 10 or 11 a Clock in the Morning, before I could perceive the Sea-Breeze to ari&s;e, and that not di&s;|cernable many times, but by the flying of the Clouds, e&s;pecially if I was in a Valley; and it was in Vallies that I did chiefly perceive the Land-Winds, which blew in &s;ome places one way, in others contrary, or &s;ide-ways to that according as the Vallies lay pend up between the Mountains; and that without any re&s;pect to either the North or the South Seas, but indeed near either &s;ide of the Land, they always bent their cour&s;e towards the neare&s;t Sea, unle&s;s there was any Hill between them and the Sea, and then they took their Cour&s;e along in the Vallies; but from both &s;hores, as well from the North as the South they blow right forth into the Sea.</P>
<P>In the I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica</HI> the&s;e Land-Winds are in the middle of the Country, al&s;o I have found them &s;o, as I travelled from one &s;ide of the I&s;land to the other, having lain 2 Nights by the way, as I had before ob&s;erved them, when I liv'd at 16 Miles Walk, where I continued about 6 Months; but there and in other I&s;lands the Land-Winds do blow towards the neare&s;t &s;hores, and &s;o from thence off to Sea, whether the &s;hore's lye Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North or South.</P>
<P>The&s;e Winds blow off to Sea, a greater or le&s;s di&s;tance according as the Coa&s;t lies more or le&s;s ex|po&s;ed to the Sea-Winds: For in &s;ome Places we find them bri&s;k 3 or 4 Leagues off &s;hore; in other Places not &s;o many Miles, and in &s;ome Places they &s;carce peep without the Rocks, or if they do &s;ome|times in very fair Weather make a &s;ally out a Mile or 2, they are not la&s;ting, but &s;uddenly vani&s;h away,
<PB N="31" REF="364">
though yet there are every Night as fre&s;h Land-Winds a&s;hore at tho&s;e Places as in any other part of the World.</P>
<P>Places mo&s;t remarkable for the fewe&s;t or fainte&s;t Land-Winds, are tho&s;e that lye mo&s;t open to the Common Trade-Winds, as the Ea&s;t ends of any I&s;lands where the Trade-Winds do blow in upon the Shore, or the Head-Lands on I&s;lands or Con|tinents that are open to the Sea-breez, e&s;pecially where the Trade-Wind blows down &s;ide-ways, by the Coa&s;t; for there &s;uch Head-Lands as &s;tretch farthe&s;t out to Sea are mo&s;t expo&s;ed to Winds from the Sea; and have the le&s;s benefit of the Land-Breezes.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give a few In&s;tances of either. And fir&s;t of all begin with the N. E. and S. E. Points of the I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica:</HI> The&s;e Points are at the Ea&s;t end of the I&s;land, one is at the very Extreme of the North &s;ide towards the Ea&s;t, the other on the South Extreme towards the &s;ame Point; at the&s;e two Places we &s;eldom light of a Land-Wind; nor very often at the End of the I&s;land between them, except near the &s;hore. For that Rea&s;on the <HI>Sloop|men</HI> of <HI>Jamaica</HI> that Trade round the I&s;land are commonly put to their Trumps, when they come there in their Voyages: For if they meet no Land-Wind they are obliged to beat about by turning to Wind-ward again&s;t the Sea-breez in the Day time; they then cur&s;e the&s;e Points of Land, and are fool|i&s;hly apt to believe that &s;ome <HI>Daemon</HI> haunts there.</P>
<P>And if they are 2 or 3 days in beating about (as &s;ometimes they are) when they return to <HI>Port-Roy|al,</HI> they will talk as much of their Fatigues, as if they had been beating a Month to double the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> though indeed the Men are bri&s;k e|nough, and manage their Sloops very well; which al&s;o are generally very good Boats to &s;ail on a Wind. I think they are the be&s;t &s;mall Trading-Boats in the King's Dominions.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="365">
Point <HI>Pedro</HI> on the <HI>South-&s;ide</HI> of the I&s;land, is another very bad Point to double, if a <HI>Ship</HI> come from the We&s;t-end of the I&s;land; This Point runs out far into the <HI>Sea,</HI> and is not only de&s;titute of the Common Land-VVinds. But if there is any Current &s;etting to Leeward, here the <HI>Sloop-men</HI> meet it. Therefore they are many times longer beating about it, then about the two former Points of the <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> and the <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and not with|out be&s;towing &s;ome Cur&s;es upon it. Nay &s;ome Captains of Privateers, when they have been beat|ing about it, have &s;tood clo&s;e into the Point, and fired their Guns to kill the old <HI>Daemon</HI> that they &s;ay inhabits there to di&s;turb poor <HI>Seamen.</HI> I have re|lated the&s;e odd Pa&s;&s;ages to &s;hew how ignorant Men are that cannot &s;ee the Rea&s;on of it. And becau&s;e I am not willing to leave my Reader in the dark, I &s;hall give a few In&s;tances more on this &s;ubject. The North &s;ide of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> at the entrance into the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> gives us another In&s;tance of bad Land-VVinds; and commonly where the Land-VVinds are &s;canty, the Sea-Breezes are but indiffer|ent neither. This will partly appear by what I have ob&s;erved of them on this Coa&s;t between <HI>Cape Cato|ach;</HI> and <HI>Cape Condecedo</HI> at the entrance of the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> which two places are about Eighty Leagues di&s;tant; for there the Land trends Ea&s;t and We&s;t. It is a &s;treight Coa&s;t and lies all of it equally expo&s;ed to the Trade-VVind, which is commonly there at E. N. E. To the VV. of the&s;e Places the Sea and Land-VVinds do as duly &s;ucceed each other, as on any other Coa&s;t, but here they are each of them of a Ba&s;tard kind; for the Sea-Breezes are at N. E. by E. which is no better than a Coa&s;t Trade-VVind, and the Land-VVind is at E. S. E. or S. E. by E. whereas if the Winds were as true there as on other Coa&s;ts, the Sea-Breez would be at N. N. E
<PB N="33" REF="366">
&s;ometimes at N. and the Land-Winds would be at S. S. E. and S. as they are indeed clo&s;e under the &s;hore; which if they do at any time come off from, they are very faint. The Land on this Coa&s;t is low and even, and the Land-Winds a&s;hore are pret|ty bri&s;k.</P>
<P>The Capes on the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Coa&s;t in the <HI>South Seas,</HI> will more fully make it appear, that Head-Lands do &s;eldom afford any Land-Winds. I &s;hall only In&s;tance in <HI>Cape Pa&s;&s;ao,</HI> in Lat. 8 Minutes <HI>South, Cape St. Laurence,</HI> in Lat. 1 d.&mdash;<HI>South,</HI> and <HI>Cape Blanco,</HI> in 3 d.&mdash;<HI>South.</HI> I have pa&s;s'd by them all &s;everal times and at differ|ent Sea&s;ons; yet did never find any Land-winds there, though between the&s;e Places there are very good Land-winds. Therefore <HI>Ships</HI> that &s;ail to the <HI>Southward</HI> again&s;t the Breeze, mu&s;t beat it about by hard Labour, e&s;pecially about <HI>Cape Blanco,</HI> for that lyes more expo&s;ed than the other 2: and if there is any Current, as commonly, the Spaniards are a long time getting about, &s;ometimes a Fortnight or 3 Weeks; and when they have &s;plit their <HI>Sails,</HI> which are &s;eldom very good, they run back to <HI>Guiaquill</HI> to mend them again. We found it hard getting about, tho' our <HI>Sails</HI> were good; and I think we could work our <HI>Ships</HI> better than the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are ever able to do in tho&s;e <HI>Seas.</HI></P>
<P>I have already given &s;everal In&s;tances of &s;uch Places, as have no Land-winds, or at lea&s;t but very ordinary ones; I &s;hall next proceed in order to &s;hew where the &s;tronge&s;t or be&s;t Land-Winds are met with; and then I &s;hall &s;peak of tho&s;e Places where there blows a moderate and indifferent Gale between both Extreams: That &s;o any one may judge by the Lying of the Land, whether it may afford a good Land-wind or know.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="367">
The bri&s;ke&s;t Land-winds are commonly in deep Bays, in great Lakes within Land, and among great Ranges of I&s;lands or &s;mall Keys that lye near the &s;hore: I &s;hall give In&s;tances of all the&s;e. And as for Bays, I &s;hall fir&s;t pitch on the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> which lies between <HI>Cape Condecedo</HI> and the High-Land of <HI>St. Martin;</HI> between both the&s;e Places the Land-winds are as bri&s;k 2 or 3 Leagues off at <HI>Sea,</HI> as in any Place that I know. In the Cod or Middle of the Bay, the Land trends from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, there the <HI>Sea-Breezes</HI> are at North, and the Land-winds at South; they commonly begin to blow at 7 or 8 a Clock in the Evening, and continue till 8 or 9 the next Morning, in the dry <HI>Sea&s;on</HI> e&s;pecially. In that Bay there is an I&s;land, call'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h Beef-I&s;land</HI> from the multitude of Bulls and Cows that inhabit it. The &s;mell of the&s;e wild Cattle is driven off to <HI>Sea,</HI> by the Land-winds &s;o fre&s;h, that by it Ma&s;ters of <HI>Ships</HI> &s;ailing in the Night on this Coa&s;t have known where they were, and have pre|&s;ently anchored that Night, and come into the I&s;land of <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> the next Day; whereas they would otherwi&s;e have pa&s;t farther to the We&s;tward quite out of their way, if they had not &s;mell'd the &s;trong &s;cent of the&s;e Cattle.</P>
<P>So all the bottom of the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> even from the High-Land of <HI>St. Martin</HI> down to <HI>Lavera Cruz,</HI> and from thence Northerly towards the River <HI>Me&s;cha&s;ipi</HI> affords good Land-winds and Sea|breezes. The Bay of <HI>Honduras</HI> al&s;o, and almo&s;t all the Coa&s;t between it and <HI>Cape La Vela,</HI> affords the like, allowing for the Capes and Points of Land, which lye between; where it fails more or le&s;s, as the <HI>Points</HI> do lye more or le&s;s expo&s;ed to the Sea-Breezes.</P>
<P>So in the <HI>South Seas,</HI> the Bays of <HI>Panama, Gui|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">quil, Paita,</HI> &amp;c. have their fre&s;h Land-winds and Sea|breezes. But in &s;ome Places, as particularly at <HI>Paita,</HI> the Land-winds do not &s;pring up till 12 a Clock in
<PB N="35" REF="368">
the Night, but then are always very fre&s;h, and la&s;t till 7 or 8 the next Morning; and they are con&s;tant all the Year long: Whereas in the Bay of <HI>Panama,</HI> and al&s;o in all the Bays and Coa&s;ts of the other, or North &s;ide of <HI>America</HI> already de&s;cribed, they are not &s;o con&s;tant in the wet <HI>Sea&s;on</HI> as they are in the dry.</P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Campeachy</HI> will al&s;o afford us In&s;tan|ces of the Land-winds that blow in <HI>Logunes:</HI> As for In&s;tance, the <HI>Lagune</HI> of <HI>Tri&s;t,</HI> which is about 9 or 10 Leagues long and 3 broad, is barricadoed from the Sea by the I&s;land of <HI>Tri&s;t.</HI> There the Land-winds blow in the dry <HI>Sea&s;on</HI> from 5 or 6 a Clock in the Evening, till 9 or 10 in the Morning. There are two other <HI>Lagunes</HI> lying within that, and parted from it by low <HI>Mangrove-Land:</HI> there the Land-winds are fre&s;her and the Sea-Breeze duller, and of a le&s;s continuance, than in the <HI>Lagune</HI> of <HI>Tri&s;t.</HI> Nay, &s;ometimes the Land-wind blows all Day; &s;o in the <HI>Lagune</HI> of <HI>Maracabo</HI> to Wind-ward of <HI>Cape Alta Vola,</HI> the Land-winds are very fre&s;h and la&s;ting. The like may be &s;aid of the <HI>Lagune</HI> of <HI>Venizuella</HI> or <HI>Comana.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes in the fore-mentioned <HI>Lagunes,</HI> the Land-winds do blow for 3 or 4 Days and Nights together, &s;carce &s;uffering the Sea-Breez to breath there; though at the &s;ame time the Sea-Breez may blow fre&s;h out at Sea: and if the Sea-Breez at &s;uch times &s;hould make a bold <HI>Sally</HI> into the&s;e <HI>Lagunes,</HI> it would be but of a &s;hort continuance. On the other Hand at Capes and Head-Lands more expo&s;ed to Sea-Breezes, the Land-winds are &s;hier of coming there, than the Sea-winds are into <HI>Lagunes.</HI> Neither may we forget the Harbour of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> for there are very good Land-winds. It is compa&s;&s;ed in on one &s;ide with a long Neck of Sand, and many &s;mall I&s;lands at the mouth of it, and within there is a
<PB N="36" REF="369">
pretty deep Lake, in which are con&s;tant Sea and Land-winds, by which the Wherry-men run with full &s;ail, both to <HI>Legamy</HI> or <HI>Pa&s;&s;age Fort,</HI> from the Town and back again. They go away with the Sea-Breeze, and return with the Land-wind. There|fore Pa&s;&s;engers that have occa&s;ion to go either way, wait for the coming of the&s;e Winds, except their Bu&s;ine&s;s requires ha&s;t: for then they are rowed again&s;t the Breez; and tho' the Land-winds do &s;ometimes fail or come very late, yet the Wherries &s;eldom &s;tay beyond their con&s;tant Hours of 7 or 8 a Clock, and &s;ometimes the Land-winds do come by 3 or 4, but when they come &s;o early it is com|monly after a Tornado from the Land. This may &s;uffice as to the Land-winds in Lakes or Bays.</P>
<P>As to what may be &s;poken concerning the Land-winds among I&s;lands, I &s;hall only mention 2 Places, both of them in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> the fir&s;t are the <HI>Keys</HI> of <HI>Cuba,</HI> which are abundance of &s;mall I&s;lands bordering on the <HI>South &s;ide</HI> of <HI>Cuba,</HI> reaching in length from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, or near tho&s;e Points as the I&s;land lies, about 70 Leagues; and in &s;ome Places reaching near 20 Leagues from the &s;aid I&s;land. Among the&s;e I&s;lands, even from the outer|mo&s;t of them, quite home to <HI>Cuba,</HI> there are very bri&s;k Land-winds. They &s;pring up early in the Evening, and blow late in the Morning. The <HI>Ja|maica</HI> Turtlers vi&s;it the&s;e <HI>Keys</HI> with good &s;ucce&s;s for Turtle all the Year long, and from thence bring mo&s;t of their Turtle wherewith the Market of <HI>Port-Royal</HI> is &s;erved. The other I&s;lands I &s;hall men|tion are the <HI>Sambaloe</HI> I&s;lands betwixt <HI>Cape Sambla&s;s</HI> and <HI>Golden I&s;land,</HI> tho' they are not &s;o large a Range as the <HI>Keys</HI> of <HI>Cuba,</HI> yet do they afford very good Land-winds; near as good as the <HI>Keys</HI> of <HI>Cuba</HI> do. And thus much for the Places where the be&s;t as well as where the &s;cantie&s;t or fainte&s;t Land-winds are
<PB N="37" REF="370">
found. I &s;hall next give &s;ome In&s;tances of the Medium between both Extreams.</P>
<P>I have already &s;hewn that Capes and &s;uch Head-Lands as lye out farthe&s;t from the re&s;t of the &s;hore, are thereby mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the Sea-winds, and con&s;equently the Land-winds are there much fain|ter than in other Places, e&s;pecially in deep Bays or Lagunes within Land, or among I&s;lands and &s;mall Keys near the Land; All which is no more than my own experience has taught me. I &s;hall now &s;hew how the Land-winds blow on Coa&s;ts that do lye more level. As all Coa&s;ts have their Points and bendings, &s;o accordingly the Land-winds are fre|&s;her or fainter, as you come either towards the&s;e bendings or towards intermitting Points or Head-Lands.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give an In&s;tance of this by &s;hewing how the Winds are on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coraccos.</HI> It is as &s;treight a <HI>Shore</HI> as I can pitch on, yet full of &s;mall Bays, di|vided from each other by a like number of Ridges of High-Land, that &s;hoot forth their Heads a little way without the Bays on each &s;ide. There in the Night or Morning, while the Land-wind blows, we find fre&s;h Gales out of the Bays: but when we come abrea&s;t of the Head-Lands, we find it Calm; yet &s;ee the Breeze curling on the Water on both &s;ides of us, and &s;ometimes get a &s;purt of it to help us forward: and having recovered the Wind out of the next Bay, we pa&s;s by the Mouth of it pre&s;ently, till we come to the next Head; and there we lye becalmed as before.</P>
<P>The&s;e Bays are not above half a Mile or a Mile wide; neither are the Heads much wider; but the&s;e Heads of the Ridges lying in between the Bays, have &s;teep Cliffs again&s;t the Sea; and where|ever I have met the like &s;teep Cliffs again&s;t the Sea, I have &s;eldom found any Land-Winds. But in all other Places where the Bays &s;trike deeper in|to the Land, there we find the Land-winds more
<PB N="38" REF="371">
la&s;ting and &s;trong; and where the Points are farther out, there are &s;till the le&s;s Land-winds, and the bri&s;ker Sea-Breezes. For the Capes and &s;maller Points on all &s;hores &s;eem to be &s;o many Barricadoes to break off the violence of the Sea-Breezes; for this we always find when we are turning to Wind|ward being to Leeward of a Cape, that the Breez is moderate, e&s;pecially if we keep very near the &s;hore; but when once we come within a Mile, more or le&s;s of the Cape and &s;tand off to Sea, as &s;oon as we get without it, we find &s;uch a hu&s;&s;ing Breez, that &s;ometimes we are not able to ply again&s;t it, but in the Night we find a fre&s;h Land-wind to Leeward; tho' when we come to the Cape we find it Calm; or perhaps &s;ometimes meet with a Sea-wind. The Land-Breezes on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea</HI> between <HI>Cape St. Anns</HI> and <HI>Cape Palmas,</HI> (mentioned in the &s;econd Chapter of this Di&s;cour&s;e,) are at E. blowing bri&s;k 4 Leagues off &s;hore: the Sea-winds there are at S. W. The Land-winds on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Angola</HI> are at E. N. E. the Sea-winds at W. S. W. the&s;e are very true Winds of both kinds.</P>
<P>The Land-winds on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Mex|ico</HI> in the <HI>South Seas,</HI> are in mo&s;t Places right off from the &s;hore, el&s;e the Fi&s;her-men could never go out to Sea, as they do, on Bark-Loggs. And as the Land-winds are true there, &s;o are the Sea-Breezes al&s;o; for with the Land-wind they go out to Fi&s;h, and return in again with the Sea-winds. In &s;ome Places they u&s;e Seals-Skins in&s;tead of Bark-Loggs; they are made &s;o tight that no Bladder is tighter. To the&s;e they have long Necks like the Neck of a Bladder, into which they put a Pipe and blow them up, as we do Bladders; two of the&s;e being fa&s;tned together, a Man &s;ets a-&s;tride them, having one be|fore and the other behind him; and &s;o &s;its firmer than in a Troopers Saddle. His Paddle is like a
<PB N="39" REF="372">
Quarter-&s;taff, with a broad Blade at each end; with this he &s;trikes the <HI>Sea</HI> back, fir&s;t on one &s;ide, and then on the other, with each end of his Pad|dle, and &s;o gives him&s;elf fre&s;h way through the Water.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> al&s;o there are true Sea-Breezes, as well on the I&s;lands, as on the Main. On I&s;lands, as at <HI>Bantam</HI> in the I&s;land <HI>Java,</HI> and at <HI>Achin</HI> in the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and in many Places on the I&s;land <HI>Mindanao:</HI> And on the Main al&s;o, as parti|cularly at <HI>Fort St George</HI> on the Coa&s;t <HI>Coromandel.</HI> There the Land-winds blow right off from the &s;hore, and the Sea-winds right in; but &s;ometimes they come &s;lanting in; and about <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> they blow from the N. E. or N. N. E. I found them &s;o when I came on the Coa&s;t, and being advi&s;ed of it by Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> in who&s;e Sloop I then was, I fell in with the Land 10 or 12 Leagues to the North|ward of the Fort, and had a bri&s;k Northerly Sea-wind to bring me into the Road.</P>
<P>I think the&s;e In&s;tances are enough to &s;hew how the&s;e Land-winds do u&s;ually blow in mo&s;t parts of the World; &s;hould I be very particular, 'tis not a larger Treati&s;e then I intend this to be, would hold a quarter-part of it. But I have been more particu|lar in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> and <HI>South Seas,</HI> becau&s;e the&s;e Land-winds are of more u&s;e there than in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies:</HI> For though &s;ometimes Men in the <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dies</HI> do turn again&s;t the <HI>Mon&s;oons,</HI> yet they do ge|nerally tarry for them before they budge.</P>
<P>Indeed the&s;e Winds are an extraordinary ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e that u&s;e the Sea in any part of the World, within the Tropicks; for as the con&s;tant Trade-winds do blow, there could be no &s;ailing in the&s;e Seas: But by the help of the Sea and Land-Breezes, Ships will &s;ail 2 or 3 hundred Leagues; as particularly from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to the <HI>Lagune</HI> of <HI>Tri&s;t,</HI> in
<PB N="40" REF="373">
the Bay of <HI>Campeachy;</HI> and then back again, all again&s;t the Trade-wind; And I think this is one of the longe&s;t Voyages that is u&s;ed of this kind. If any of our <HI>Jamaica Sloops</HI> do go to <HI>Tri&s;t,</HI> and de|&s;ign to carry their Wood to <HI>Cura&s;ao,</HI> then they put through the Gulph of <HI>Florida.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> al&s;o that come from any part of the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and are bound to any Place to Windward of the I&s;land <HI>Cuba,</HI> are wont to put through the Gulph, and &s;o &s;tretch away to the Northward, till they come clear of the Trade, and then &s;tand away as far as they plea&s;e to the Ea&s;tward; This is al&s;o the u&s;ual way from <HI>Ja|maica</HI> to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> though &s;ometimes they turn up by the <HI>Carribbee</HI> I&s;lands, only taking the Benefit of the&s;e Sea and Land-winds. So al&s;o <HI>Ships</HI> may and do pa&s;s from <HI>Portobello</HI> to <HI>Car|thagena,</HI> or to <HI>St. Martha,</HI> or to any other Place, by the help of the&s;e Breezes, if the di|&s;tance is not too far. So by taking the Advan|tage of the&s;e Winds, Sloops in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> &s;ail clear round the I&s;lands, or to any part of them, in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>In the South Seas al&s;o the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in their Voy|ages from <HI>Panama</HI> to <HI>Lima,</HI> by taking the Advan|tage of the&s;e Winds, do &s;ail as high as <HI>Cape Blan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o;</HI> but in all their Voyages to the Southward of that Cape, they &s;tand quite off to Sea into the Trade. Thus you &s;ee the u&s;e and advantage of them.</P>
<P>The Seamen that &s;ail in <HI>Sloops</HI> or other &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> do know very well when they &s;hall meet a bri&s;k Land-Wind, by the Foggs that hang over the Land before Night; for it is a certain &s;ign of of a good Land-Wind, to &s;ee a thick Fogg lye &s;till and quiet, like Smoak over the Land, not &s;tirring any way; and we look out for &s;uch Signs when we
<PB N="41" REF="374">
are plying to Windward. For if we &s;ee no Fog over the Land, the Land-wind will be but faint and &s;hort that Night. The&s;e &s;igns are to be ob&s;erved chiefly in fair Weather: for in the wet <HI>Sea&s;on</HI> Foggs do hang over the Land all the Day, and it may be neither Land-wind nor Sea-Breeze &s;tirring. If in the Afternoon al&s;o in fair Weather, we &s;ee a Tornado over the Land, it commonly &s;ends us forth a fre&s;h Land-Wind.</P>
<P>The&s;e Land-winds are very cold, and though the Sea-Breezes are always much &s;tronger, yet the&s;e are colder by far. The Sea-Breezes indeed are very comfortable and refre&s;hing; for the hot|te&s;t time in all the Day is about 9, 10 or 11 a Clock in the Morning, in the interval between both Breezes: For then it is commonly Calm, and then People pant for breath, e&s;pecially if it is late before the Sea-Breez comes, but afterwards the Breez allays the heat. However, in the Evening again after the Sea-Breez is &s;pent, it is very hot till the Land-wind &s;prings up, which is &s;ometimes not till 12 a Clock or after.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on Men when they go to Bed uncloath them&s;elves and lye without any thing over them: Nay, the ordinary &s;ort of People &s;pread mats at their Doors, or el&s;e in their Yards, in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and lye down to &s;leep in the open Air.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> at <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> al&s;o Men take their Cotts or little Field-Beds, and put them into the Yards, and go to &s;leep in the Air: And Seamen aboard Ships in the&s;e hot Countries lye on the Deck, till the Land-wind comes.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Jamaica</HI> or <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> have &s;omewhat to cover them&s;elves when the Land-wind comes, be&s;ide a Pillow on their
<PB N="42" REF="375">
Brea&s;t, or between their Arms. But Seamen who have wrought hard all Day, lye naked and ex|po&s;ed to the Air, it may be all Night long, before they awake, without any covering, e&s;|pecially if they have had their do&s;e of Punch. But next Morning they are &s;carce able to budge, being &s;tiff with cold, that brings them to Fluxes, and that to their Graves; and this is the fate of many &s;tout and brave Seamen: and it is a great pity that Ma&s;ters of Ships have &s;o little regard for their Men, as not by &s;ome good Orders, to prohibit this dangerous Cu&s;tom of lying abroad and naked in the Nights.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of Land-winds and Sea-Breezes, peculiar to &s;ome Coa&s;ts at &s;ome particular &s;ea&s;ons of the Year; as al&s;o of &s;ome Winds that produce &s;trange Effects.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the <HI>Summa&s;enta-Winds</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Cam|peachy.</HI> Of the Winds peculiar to the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Carthagena.</HI> Winds on the <HI>Mexican</HI> Coa&s;ts, call'd <HI>Popogaios.</HI> Others on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> call'd <HI>Terrenos:</HI> The &s;ame about <HI>Malabar,</HI> but at a different Sea&s;on: As al&s;o in the <HI>Per&s;ian Gulph.</HI> And of the <HI>Her|matans</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Guinea.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Shall begin with the <HI>Summa&s;enta-Winds,</HI> as they are called, which blow in the Bay of <HI>Cam|peachy.</HI> The&s;e are Winds that come in the Months of <HI>Feb. March</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> and they blow on|ly in that Bay between the High-Land of St. <HI>Mar|tin</HI> and <HI>Cape Condecedo;</HI> which Places are about 120 Leagues a&s;under. They are, properly &s;peaking, nei|ther Sea-Breezes nor true Land-winds, yet in re&s;pect of their blowing in &s;ome mea&s;ure from the &s;hore, they are in that &s;omewhat of kin to the Land-winds. The&s;e Winds are commonly at E. S. E. in the Cod or Middle of the Bay where the Land lies E. and W. and the true Land-winds there are at S. S. E. but from thence towards <HI>Cape Condecedo,</HI> the Land trends away N. E. and N. N. E. and N. So that they be|come Land-winds there re&s;pecting the Land from
<PB N="44" REF="377">
whence they blow; but then they differ both from Sea and Land-Breezes in re&s;pect to their duration: For the&s;e <HI>Summa&s;enta-Winds</HI> blow 3 or 4 Days, &s;ometimes a Week, both Night and Day before they cea&s;e. They are commonly dry Winds and blow very fre&s;h, and Ships that go from <HI>Tri&s;t</HI> with Log|wood at the time when the&s;e Winds blow, will be at <HI>Cape Condecedo</HI> in 3 or 4 Days; whereas if they go at any other time, it will take up 8 or 10 Days, tho' &s;eldom more than that: For here are good Land-winds and Sea-Breezes at other times.</P>
<P>The&s;e Winds are commonly colder than the Sea-winds, though not &s;o cold as the Land-winds, yet &s;tronger than either. I never could perceive that the&s;e Winds did make any alteration on our Bodies different from other Winds. But the Tides when the&s;e Winds blow on that Coa&s;t, are very &s;mall, e&s;|pecially in the <HI>Lagunes</HI> of <HI>Tri&s;t;</HI> &s;o that the <HI>Leg|wood-Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">s</HI> that bring the Wood aboard of the Ships, are then forced to lye &s;till for want of Water to float them over &s;ome flats in the <HI>Lagunes.</HI></P>
<P>On the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">thagena</HI> there are a peculiar &s;ort of Winds that blow in the Months of <HI>April, May</HI> and <HI>June</HI> &s;o very fierce, that Ships are not able to ply to Windward on that Coa&s;t while the&s;e Winds la&s;t. The&s;e Winds blow about 40 or 50 <HI>Leagues</HI> to <HI>Windward</HI> of <HI>Carthagena</HI> Town, and about 10 to Leeward of it. They are very fierce from the middle of the Channel between it and <HI>Hi|&s;paniola,</HI> and &s;o continue almo&s;t to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Car|thagena.</HI> Tho' they are &s;ometimes a little fainter within 2 or 3 <HI>Leagues</HI> of the &s;hore, e&s;pecially Morn|ings and Evenings. They commonly ri&s;e in the Morning before day, &s;ometimes at 3 or 4 a Clock, and &s;o continue till 9, 10 or 11 at Night, and thus they will blow 10 or 11 Days together very fiercely. At this time the Land-winds be&s;ides their &s;hort conti|nuance are very faint and blow but a little way off &s;hore: So that from 10 or 11 at Night till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the
<PB N="45" REF="378">
Morning 'tis quite Calm and not one breath of Wind from a <HI>League</HI> di&s;tant off the &s;hore; tho' 3 or 4 further off you'll find the Breez, and nearer a &s;mall <HI>Land-Wind.</HI> The&s;e Winds are at E. N. E. as the Common Trade is; whereas the Sea-Breezes are at N. E. by N. or N. N. E.</P>
<P>While the&s;e fierce Winds &s;tay, the Sky is com|monly clear without any Cloud to be &s;een; tho' doubtle&s;s 'tis imperceptibly hazy, for then the Sun does not give a true black &s;hade on the Ground, but very faint and du&s;ky. The Horizon too looks very du&s;ky, thick and hazy, and while the Sun is near the Horizon, either in the Morning or Evening, it looks very red. Sometimes, tho' but &s;eldom, when the&s;e Winds blow the Sky is over-ca&s;t with &s;mall Clouds, which afford &s;ome drizling &s;mall Rain. But tho' the&s;e Winds are &s;o fierce on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Carthage|na,</HI> yet both to Windward and to Leeward at the di&s;tances before-mentioned, the Breezes blow mo|derate as at other times. For the Sea and Land|winds do there keep their con&s;tant and regular Cour&s;es. Neither are the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> or <HI>Jamaica</HI> troubled with the&s;e fierce Winds, any nearer than half Channel over as was &s;aid before.</P>
<P>It has not been my fortune to have been on this Coa&s;t when the&s;e Winds have blown, yet I have had the Relation of it &s;o often, and from &s;o many Per&s;ons that I am very well &s;atisfi'd of the truth of it: Nay, it is &s;o generally known among the <HI>Jamaica</HI> Seamen and Privateers that they call a <HI>Talkative Per&s;on</HI> in de|ri&s;ion, a <HI>Carthagene-Breeze.</HI> I remember 2 or 3 Men that went by that Name, and I knew them by no other, tho' I was in the &s;ame Ship with them &s;eve|ral Months.</P>
<P>Some of our Engli&s;h Frigots that have been &s;ent to <HI>Jamaica</HI> have experienced the&s;e Breezes when the Governour has &s;ent them upon bu&s;ine&s;s to that Coa&s;t: For plying between <HI>Portobello</HI> and <HI>Carthagena,</HI> when they have been within 10 Leagues of <HI>Carthagena,</HI> they
<PB N="46" REF="379">
have met with the Sea Breez &s;o &s;trong that they have been forced to riff their Top&s;ail, which even then they could not maintain, but have been oblig|ed to furle it quite up; and &s;o with only their lower Sails, which &s;ometimes they have been forced to riff too, have been beating 8 or 10 Days, to get only &s;o many Leagues; which tho' at la&s;t they have done, yet has it been with much trouble, and not without damage to their Sails and Rigging. Neither can I forget a <HI>Squadron</HI> of French Frigots, Com|manded by the Count <HI>de E&s;trees,</HI> that came to <HI>Ja|maica,</HI> and demanded leave of the Governour to Wood and Water there; which becau&s;e it &s;eemed &s;trange that they &s;hould want in coming only from <HI>Petit Guavas;</HI> it was demanded of them why they came from thence &s;o ill provided? They &s;aid they went from <HI>Petit Guavas</HI> over to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Car|thagena,</HI> with a de&s;ign to have plyed to Wind-ward under that &s;hore, but met the Breezes &s;o hard on the Coa&s;t, that they were not able to hold up their &s;ides again&s;t it, and for that Rea&s;on &s;tood back again to|wards <HI>Petit Guavas;</HI> but not being able to fetch it, therefore they came to Wood and Water at <HI>Jamai|ca,</HI> de&s;igning to go from thence thro' the Gulph: And tho' the Pilots of <HI>Jamaica</HI> did all conclude that the Breeze-time was pa&s;t by more than a Month, yet the Governour gave them leave to Wood and Water at <HI>Blew-fields Bay,</HI> and &s;ent one Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> to be their Pilot thither. This was in 1679 and in one of our Sum|mer Months, but I can't tell which, tho' I was there.</P>
<P>In the <HI>South Seas</HI> on the <HI>Mexican</HI> Coa&s;t, between <HI>Cape Blanco</HI> in the <HI>Lat.</HI> of 9 D. 56 M. North and <HI>Realeja,</HI> in <HI>Lat.</HI> 11 North, which two Places are about 80 <HI>Leagues</HI> di&s;tance, there are Winds which blow only in the Months of <HI>May, June,</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> call'd by the <HI>Spaniards Popogaios.</HI> They blow Night and Day without intermi&s;&s;ion, &s;ometimes 3 or 4 Days or a Week together.

went from <HI>Caldera</HI> Bay, bound to <HI>Realeja</HI> mentioned in my Voyage round the World, Chap. 5. Pag. 118. which blew at <HI>North.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> there are Winds call'd by the <HI>Portugue&s;e Terrenos,</HI> becau&s;e they blow from the <HI>Land.</HI> The&s;e are not tho&s;e <HI>Land-Winds</HI> that I have already treated of; for the&s;e blow only in <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>Aug.</HI> and are in &s;everal re&s;pects quite contrary to them. For where|as the true <HI>Land-Winds</HI> blow only in the Night, in|cluding Evenings and Mornings; on the contrary, the&s;e blow 3 or 4 Days without intermi&s;&s;ion; nay &s;ometimes a Week or 10 Days together: and as the true Nocturnal <HI>Land-Winds</HI> are very cold, on the contrary the&s;e are the hotte&s;t of all Winds I ever heard of: They come with hot Blooms, &s;uch as I have mentioned in my <HI>Voyage round the World,</HI> Chap. 20. Pag. 530. The&s;e <HI>Winds</HI> are at <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and they blow only in the Months of <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> which is the <HI>We&s;t Mon&s;oon-Sea&s;on,</HI> tho' the proper <HI>Mon&s;oon</HI> then on this Coa&s;t is S. W. When the&s;e hot Winds come, the better &s;ort of People at <HI>Fort St. George</HI> keep clo&s;e: They al&s;o &s;hut up their Win|dows and Doors to keep them out; and I have heard Gentlemen that lived there &s;ay, that when they have been thus &s;hut up within Doors, they have been &s;en&s;ible when the Wind &s;hifted by the Change they have felt in their Bodies. And notwith&s;tanding that the&s;e Winds are &s;o hot, yet the Inhabitants don't &s;weat while they la&s;t, for their Skins are hard and rough, as if they had been parched by the Fire, e&s;pecially their Faces and Hands, yet does it not make them &s;ick. The Sands which are rai&s;ed by the&s;e Winds are a great annoyance to tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s lyes abroad, and who can't keep their Hou&s;es. For many times they wheel about and rai&s;e the <HI>Sands</HI> &s;o thick, that it flies like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">moak in Peoples Eyes; and the <HI>Ships</HI> al&s;o
<PB N="48" REF="381">
that lye in the road at that time have their Decks covered with this <HI>Sand.</HI></P>
<P>On the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar</HI> they have of the&s;e &s;ons of Winds al&s;o, but not at the &s;ame time of the Year. For as the&s;e on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel</HI> blow in the Months of <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> when the <HI>We&s;t Mon&s;oon</HI> Reigns; on the contrary on the <HI>Malabar</HI> Coa&s;t they blow in the Months of <HI>December, January</HI> and <HI>February,</HI> when the Ea&s;t or North Ea&s;t <HI>Mon&s;oon</HI> blows: for then the Ea&s;terly Wind, which is then the true <HI>Mon&s;oon,</HI> comes from over the <HI>Land</HI> of this Coa&s;t; This being the <HI>We&s;t-&s;ide,</HI> as the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coro|mandel</HI> is the <HI>Ea&s;t-&s;ide</HI> of this long <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian</HI> Promontory.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;on</HI> Gulph is as remarkable for the&s;e hot Winds as either of the former; they come there in the Months of <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Mon&s;oon</HI> time; and the heat there by all Accounts does by far exceed that on the other two Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>The European Merchants that are imployed in the Ports within the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> his Domini|ons, do leave their Coa&s;t, Habitations and Bu&s;ine&s;s there, during the&s;e hot Months, and &s;pend their time at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> till the Air is more agreeable to their Bodies; but their <HI>Servants</HI> mu&s;t indure it. And if any <HI>Ships</HI> are there, then the <HI>Seamen</HI> al&s;o mu&s;t do as well as they can. 'Tis reported the Commanders do keep Bathing-Troughs full of Water to lye and wallow in, and hide their Bodies from the noi&s;om hot Blooms. I was never in any of the&s;e hot <HI>Winds,</HI> for I went from <HI>Fort St. George</HI> before they came on the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="382">
On the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea</HI> there are a particular &s;ort of Land-winds, which are very remarkable; not for their Heat, as tho&s;e la&s;t-mentioned, but for their exceeding Cold and Searching Nature. They are called <HI>Harmatans.</HI> I have had an Ac|count of them from &s;everal who have Traded to <HI>Guinea;</HI> but more e&s;pecially from a very Sen&s;ible and Experienced Gentleman, Mr <HI>Greenhill,</HI> Com|mi&s;&s;ioner of His Maje&s;ties Navy at <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> who upon my Reque&s;t, was plea&s;ed to &s;end me the following Account: which the Reader cannot have better than in his own Words.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been very ill &s;ince my return Home with the Gout; &s;o that I have not been capable of an&s;wer|ing your Expectation: But being a little better reco|vered, I &s;hall make as good a return to your Enquiry of the <HI>Harmatans</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> as my Circum&s;tances will permit. The u&s;ual Time of their blowing is between the latter part of <HI>December,</HI> and the beginning of <HI>February;</HI> before and beyond which Sea&s;ons, they never exceed. They are of &s;o very cold, &s;harp and piercing a Nature, that the Seams of the Floors of our Chambers and the Sides and Decks of our Ships (as for as they are above Water) will open &s;o wide, as that with facility you may put a Caulking Iron a con&s;iderable way into them; in which condition they continue &s;o long as the <HI>Harma|tan</HI> blows, (which is &s;ometimes two or three, and very rarely five Days, which is the very utmo&s;t I ever ob&s;erved or heard of) and when they are gone, they clo&s;e again and are as tight as if it never had been. The Natives them&s;elves and all Per&s;ons who inhabit
<PB N="50" REF="383">
tho&s;e parts (during that &s;hort Sea&s;on) to preven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> their pernicious Effects, are obliged to confine them|&s;elves within Doors; where they endeavour their own &s;ecurity, by rendering their Habitations as clo&s;e and impenetrable as po&s;&s;ible: Neither will they once &s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> abroad, unle&s;s induced thereto by a more than ordi|nary Occa&s;ion. It is as de&s;tructive to the Cattle al&s;o; who&s;e &s;afe Guard con&s;i&s;ts in their Proprietors Care, who again&s;t this Sea&s;on ought to provide &s;ome &s;uch like place for them: Otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t expect but a pittiful Account when the Sea&s;on is over; for it mo&s;t certainly de&s;troys them, and that in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>This I accidentally experimented by expo&s;ing a couple of Goats to the A&s;perity thereof; which in four hours &s;pace or thereabouts; were depriv'd of Life. Nay we our &s;elves (unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the like Conveni|ency and the benefit of &s;ome &s;weet Oyls to correct the Air) cannot fetch our Breath &s;o-freely as at other times; but are almo&s;t &s;uffocated with too frequent and Acid Re&s;pirations. They generally blow between the E. and E. N. E. to the Northward of which they never exceed, being the mo&s;t &s;ettled and &s;teddy (but fre&s;h) Gale, I ever ob&s;erv'd; coming without Thunder, Lightning or Rain; but clo&s;e gloomy Weather; the Sun not &s;hining all the time: And when they expire, the Trade-wind (which con&s;tantly blows on that Coa&s;t at W. S. W. and S. W.) returns with the accu&s;tom|ary &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of Weather.</P>
<P>The Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> from <HI>Cape Palmas</HI> to <HI>Capes Formo&s;a,</HI> lies E. and E. by N. and near tho&s;e Pointy the Land-Breezes blow on that Coa&s;t, which commo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ll begin about &s;even in the Evening, and continue al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Night, till near that time the next Morning: During which interval, we are troubled with &s;linking Fogs and Mi&s;ts off Shore, which by return of the Sea Breezes upon the oppo&s;ite Points are all driven away;
<PB N="51" REF="384">
and we have the benefit of them, in a curious fre&s;h Gale, till about 5 in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>And here let me Note it for a general Ob&s;ervation, That in the&s;e and all eother Places within the Tropicks (as far as ever I took notice) the Wind is drawn by the Land. For if an I&s;land or Head-Land, were inclin|ing to a circular Form, the Sea and Land-Breezes fall in Diametrically oppo&s;ite to that part where you are. So that if you are on the South &s;ide, the Sea-Breez &s;hall be at South, and the Land-Breez (when it comes in its Sea&s;on) at North.</P>
<P>In getting on the Coa&s;t, we indeavour to fall in with <HI>Cape Mount</HI> or <HI>Cape Mi&s;erada,</HI> which is about 18 Leagues to the E. S. Ea&s;tward thereof; and after that we double <HI>Cape Palmas</HI> (whence as afore&s;aid, the Land trends away E. by N.) the Current near the &s;hore &s;ets upon that Point down into the <HI>Bite.</HI> But in get|ting off, we as much attempt (if po&s;&s;ible) to lay hold of <HI>St. Thomas;</HI> and thence to run to the Southward of the <HI>Line,</HI> perhaps 3 or 4 Degrees; for the further Sou|therly we go, the &s;tronger we find the Gales, and more beneficial for getting off the <HI>African</HI> Coa&s;t; but tho&s;e who keep to the Northward thereof, generally meet with more Calms; and con&s;equently longer Voyages en&s;ue. In or about tho&s;e Latitudes we continue, till we are got between 25 and 30 Degrees to the We&s;t|ward of <HI>Cape Lopez de Gon&s;alvo,</HI> and then we cro&s;s again to go either for <HI>England</HI> or the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> But by the way let me ob&s;erve to you, that when once we are to the We&s;tward of the &s;aid <HI>Cape,</HI> and in South Latitude, the <HI>Current</HI> &s;ets Northerly, and the Wind to 20 Degrees of Latitude, is at E. S. E. as (to the like number of Degrees) on the North &s;ide of the Line it blows at E. N. E. Nei|ther did I ever ob&s;erve any Mutation of the Cur|rents, unle&s;s in the Tornado-Sea&s;on, when during their blowing, they commonly &s;et to Wind-ward; tho' perhaps the Moon upon Full and Change, may
<PB N="52" REF="385">
have the like influence there, as in other Places; but I never took any particular notice thereof.</P>
<P>The &s;aid <HI>Tornadoes</HI> u&s;ually come in the beginning of <HI>Apr.</HI> and &s;eldom relinqui&s;h the <HI>Gold Coa&s;t</HI> till <HI>Ju|ly</HI> commences, and with frequent vi&s;its make us &s;en&s;ible of their Qualities. We have &s;ometimes three or four in a day; but then their continuance is but &s;hort; per|haps not above two hours, and the &s;trength or fury (it may be) about a quarter or half an Hour; but accom|panied with prodigious Thunder, Lightning and Rain; and the violence of the Wind &s;o extraordinary, as that it has &s;ometimes roled up the Lead wherewith the Hou&s;es are cover'd, as clo&s;e and compactly, as po&s;&s;ible it could be done by the Art of Man. The Name implies a variety of Winds: But the &s;trength of them is generally at <HI>S. E.</HI> and by Ships that are bound off the Coa&s;t, they are made u&s;e of to get to Wind|ward.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with that mo&s;t worthy Ob&s;ervation of the Sea&s;on wherein the Rains begin; which on the <HI>Gold Coa&s;t</HI> is about the 10th of <HI>April</HI> and this may be generally remarked, from 15 d. N. to 15 d. South La|titude, that they follow the Sun within 5 or 6 d. And &s;o proceed with him till be has touched the <HI>Tropick,</HI> and returns to the like Station again. This I &s;hall illu&s;trate by the following Example, <HI>Viz. Cape Cor&s;o</HI> Ca&s;tle lies in 4 d. 55 North. About the 10th of <HI>April</HI> the Sun has near 12 degrees N. Declination. At that time the Rains begin, and continue with the Inhabitants of that Place, until he has performed his Cour&s;e to the greate&s;t obliquity from off the Equator, and returned to the like Po&s;ition South. The &s;ame I &s;uppo&s;e may be ob&s;erved, and under&s;tood of other places within the <HI>Tro|picks.</HI></P>

<P>I Have &s;ent Mr. <HI>Dampier's</HI> Book, which you were plea&s;ed to &s;end me, to Captain <HI>S&mdash;</HI> I have gone through it, and find it very well worth my time, being very delight&s;ome, and I believe true.</P>
<P>I have made &s;ome Remarks on it, as having found the like of what be a&s;&s;erts, in other places. As <HI>p.</HI> 65. mention is made of the <HI>Sucking-Fi&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Remora</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Dampier</HI> calls it.) The&s;e are mighty plenty on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Angola</HI> and at <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> and between <HI>Cape Lopes de Gon&s;alvas</HI> and the River <HI>Gabon.</HI> They are &s;haped as he de&s;cribes them.</P>
<P>As to what he &s;aith, <HI>p.</HI> 73. I have found the Indians in the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> offering fal&s;e <HI>Ambergreece</HI> to &s;ale, and particularly in Lat 25d. where in the Year 1693. &s;everal of our Men were cheated with it.</P>

<P>Their manner of Wor&s;hip, mentioned <HI>p.</HI> 338. is the very &s;ame with what I have &s;een at <HI>Algier,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary.</HI></P>

<P>I &s;hall give you the trouble of a &s;mall Relation of a Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Loango</HI> in the Year 1693. When we came &s;o far to the <HI>Southward</HI> as 2 d. 40 m. N. Lat. and 8 d. 25 m. Longi. <HI>We&s;tward</HI> from the <HI>Meridian</HI> of <HI>Lundi,</HI> it being 31 &s;t of <HI>March</HI> we had &s;mall Wind at S. S. W. and S. W. with &s;howers of Rain. There we met with prodigious &s;hoals of Fi&s;h, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of <HI>Albicores</HI> and <HI>Bonetoes.</HI> There were al&s;o great numbers of Sharks; &s;ome 10 or 12 foot long. For diver&s;ion we catch'd above an 100 of them at times. The other Fi&s;h we took as we had occa&s;ion, fre&s;h and fre&s;h: and one day we caught a Barrel of them with empty Hooks. The&s;e &s;hoals of Fi&s;h kept us Company till we were under the Equator in Long 4 d. 3 m. Ea&s;tward of the <HI>Meridian</HI> of <HI>Lundy.</HI> This was <HI>April</HI> 27. we had the Winds at S. E. and S. E. by E. fre&s;h Gales and clear Weather; but a mighty Leeward Current. At the Fi&s;hes parting with us that day, I caught an <HI>Albicore</HI> that weighed 75<HI>l.</HI> It is a mighty &s;trong Fi&s;h, &s;o that the Fi&s;hing-Craft mu&s;t be very &s;trong to take them.</P>
<P>The <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Loango</HI> I find to lye in Lat. 4d. 30m. S. and Longi. 18d. 8m. Ea&s;tward from the <HI>Meridian</HI> of <HI>Lundy:</HI> from whence I took my departure, bound for <HI>Jamaica, Oct.</HI> 7. 1693.</P>
<P>When we find the Winds South, S. by W. and S. S. W. fre&s;h Gales; veerable to S. W. and back to South, we
<PB N="56" REF="389">
&s;tand off to the We&s;tward with Larboard Tacks on Board, till we get 14 d. Long. to the We&s;tward of <HI>Lo|ango.</HI> And there we find the Winds veerable from S. S. E. to S. E. fre&s;h Gales. When we get 34 d. to the We&s;tward of <HI>Loango,</HI> we are then 16d. We&s;tward from the <HI>Meridian</HI> of <HI>Lundy:</HI> and there we find the Winds veerable from S. E. by E. to E. by S. and Ea&s;t; and &s;o they continue blowing fre&s;h as we will &s;till run to the We&s;tward between the Lat. of 3 and 4 d. South, till we make the I&s;land <HI>Fernando de Noronho,</HI> which I find to lye in Lat. 3 d. 54m. 30&s;. South. And by the Experience of two Voyages have found its Longi. 40 d. 59 m. We&s;tward from <HI>Loango,</HI> and 22 d. 51 m. from the <HI>Meridian</HI> of <HI>Lundy.</HI> This I&s;land appears with a very high Pyramid. And when we come clo&s;e to it, the Py|ramid looks like a large Cathedral. On the N. W. &s;ide is a &s;mall Bay to anchor in. But Ships mu&s;t come pretty near the &s;hore, becau&s;e it is deep Water. Here is plenty of Fi&s;h. And on the I&s;land is &s;ome fre&s;h Water, and low &s;hrubs of Trees. We could &s;ee no living Creature on it but Dogs. It was for|merly inhabited by the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> but the <HI>Dutch</HI> having then War with them, took it, and carried the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> all away. The Body of the I&s;land I judge to be about 4 Miles long, lying N. E. and S. W. near on the North &s;ide are &s;ome Rocks, pretty high above Water; and many Birds, as <HI>Sea Gulls</HI> and <HI>Man-of-War-Birds</HI> (which are &s;omething like our <HI>Kites</HI> in <HI>England</HI>) I find the Current &s;ets &s;trong to the N. W. The variation very little. From thence I &s;teered N. VV. with fre&s;h Gales S. E. and at E. S. E. in order to cro&s;s the Equator, and de&s;igning to make the I&s;land <HI>Tobago:</HI> which by my Run from the afore|&s;aid I&s;land, I find to lye in Lat. 11 d. 33 m. North Longi. VVe&s;tward of <HI>Fernando,</HI> 28 d. 19 m. The <HI>Meridian</HI> di&s;tance from <HI>Fernando</HI> 1721 Miles&punc; And by my reckoning or Journal <HI>Tobago</HI> is VVe&s;t from the <HI>Meridian</HI> of the I&s;le of <HI>Lundy</HI> 51 d. 10 m.
<PB N="57" REF="390">
In this Pa&s;&s;age between the &s;aid I&s;lands we find &s;trange Ripling and Cockling Seas, ready to leap in upon the Ships Deck; which makes us think the Current to be &s;trong: And it &s;eems to be occa&s;ioned by the great River on the main Land; which is not far from us in this Pa&s;&s;age. <HI>Tobago</HI> is an high I&s;land with a brave &s;andy Bay on the S.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>STorms within the Tropicks are generally known to us by &s;ome Name or other, to di|&s;tingui&s;h them from other common Winds: and tho' Storms are not &s;o frequent there, as they are in Latitudes nearer the Poles; yet are they ne|verthele&s;s expected yearly in their proper Months; and when they do come, they blow exceeding fierce,
<PB N="60" REF="393">
though indeed &s;ome years they do not come at all or at lea&s;t do not blow with that fiercene&s;s as at other times. And as the&s;e Winds are commonly very fierce, &s;o are they but of a &s;hort continuance, in compari&s;on with Storms that we meet with in higher Latitudes.</P>
<P>In the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> there are three &s;orts, <HI>viz. Norths, Souths</HI> and <HI>Hurricanes:</HI> In the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> there are only two &s;orts, <HI>viz. Mon&s;oones</HI> and <HI>Tuf|foones.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;orts of violent Storms, except the <HI>Norths,</HI> are expected near one time of the year: and this is taken notice of by tho&s;e that have been in any of them; that they give certain Pre&s;ages of their being at hand, &s;everal hours before they come. Norths are violent Winds, that frequently blow in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Mexico</HI> from <HI>October</HI> till <HI>March:</HI> They are chiefly expected near the full or change of the Moon, all that time of the year, but they are mo&s;t violent in <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January.</HI> The&s;e Winds are not confined to the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Mexico</HI> only, but there they are mo&s;t frequent, and rage with the greate&s;t Violence. They blow on the North &s;ide of <HI>Cuba</HI> very fierce too, and in the Gulph of <HI>Florida;</HI> as al&s;o about <HI>Hi&s;paniola, Jamaica,</HI> &amp;c. and in the Channel between <HI>Jamaica</HI> and <HI>Portabel;</HI> and in all the We&s;t Indian Sea between the I&s;lands and the Main as high as the I&s;land <HI>Trinidado.</HI> But from <HI>Ja|maica</HI> Ea&s;tward, except on the North &s;ide of the I&s;land <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> they blow no harder than a pret|ty bri&s;k Sea Wind. They are here at W. N. W. or N. W. though in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Mexico</HI> they blow &s;tronge&s;t at N. N. W. and this is the Sea&s;on of We&s;terly Winds in the&s;e Ea&s;t parts of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> as I have before noted in the third Chapter of this Di&s;cour&s;e. I &s;hall be mo&s;t particular of them that blow in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and what Signs they give us before hand.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="394">
Commonly before a North the Weather is very &s;erene and fair, the Sky clear, and but little Wind; and that too veering from its proper Point, or the common Trade-Wind of the Coa&s;t; and breathing gently at S. at S. W. and We&s;t a Day or two before the North comes. The Sea al&s;o gives notice of a Storm, by an extraordinary and long Ebb. For a Day or two before a North, there will be hardly any di&s;cernable Flood, but a con&s;tant ebbing of the Sea. And the Sea-Fowls al&s;o before a Storm, do commonly hover over the Land, which they do not at other times u&s;e to do, in &s;uch great flights and numbers. All the&s;e Signs concurring, may give any Man notice of an approaching Storm, but the great|e&s;t and mo&s;t remarkable Sign of a North, is a very black Cloud in the N. W. ri&s;ing above the Horizon to about 10 or 12 degrees: the upper edge of the Cloud appears very even and &s;mooth, and when once the upper part of the Cloud is 6, 8, 10 or 12 degrees high, there it remains in that even form parallel to the Horizon without any motion; and this &s;ome|times 2 or 3 Days before the Storm comes: At other times not above 12 or 14 hours, but never le&s;s.</P>
<P>This Cloud lying &s;o near the Horizon, is not &s;een but in the Mornings or Evenings, at lea&s;t it does not appear &s;o black as then; this is called by Eng|li&s;h Seamen a <HI>North Bank,</HI> and when ever we &s;ee &s;uch a Cloud in that part of the World, and in the Months before mentioned, we certainly provide for a Storm; and tho' &s;ometimes it may happen that &s;uch a Cloud may appear &s;everal Mornings and E|venings, and we may not feel the effects of it, or but very little; yet we always provide again&s;t it; for a North never comes without &s;uch a foreboding Cloud. But if the Winds al&s;o whiffle about to the South, with fair flattering Weather, it never &s;ails. While the Wind remains at S. S. W. or any thing to the South of the We&s;t, it blows very faint; but
<PB N="26" REF="395">
when once it comes to the North of the We&s;t, it begins to be bri&s;k and veers about pre&s;ently to the North We&s;t, where it blows hard; yet does it not &s;tay there long before it veers to the N. N. W. and there it blows &s;tronge&s;t and longe&s;t. Sometimes it continues 24 or even 48 hours, and &s;ometimes lon|ger. When the Wind fir&s;t comes to the N. W. if the black Cloud ri&s;es and comes away, it may chance to give but one flurry, like that of a Tornado; and then the Sky grows clear again; and either the Wind continues at N. W. blowing only a bri&s;k Gale, which the <HI>Jamaica</HI> Seamen call a <HI>Chocolatt North,</HI> or el&s;e it veers about again to the Ea&s;t, and &s;ettles there. But if when the Wind comes to the N. W. the Cloud &s;till remains &s;ettled, the Wind then con|tinues blowing very fierce even &s;o long as the black Bank continues near the Horizon. It is commonly pretty dry and clear, but &s;ometimes much Rain falls with a North: and tho' the Clouds which bring Rain, come from the N. W. and N. N. W. yet the black Bank near the Horizon &s;eems not to move till the Heart of the Storm is broke. When the Wind &s;tarts from the N. N. W. to the N. 'tis a &s;ign that the Violence of the Storm is pa&s;t, e&s;pecially if it veers to the Ea&s;t of the North; for then it &s;oon flies about to the Ea&s;t, and there &s;ettles at its u&s;ual Point and brings fair Weather: But if it goes back from the N. to the N. W. it will la&s;t a day or two longer, as fierce as before; and not without a great deal of Rain.</P>
<P>When our <HI>Jamaica</HI> Logwood-&s;hips are coming loaden out of the Bay of <HI>Campeachy</HI> in the North Sea&s;on, they are glad to have a North. For a good North will bring them almo&s;t to <HI>Jamaica;</HI> neither have any of our Ve&s;&s;els mi&s;carried in one of the&s;e Storms that I did ever hear of, though &s;ometimes much &s;hattered; but the Spaniards do commonly &s;uffer by them, and there is &s;eldom a Year but one
<PB N="63" REF="396">
or more of them are ca&s;t away in the Bay of <HI>Cam|peachy</HI> in this Sea&s;on: for they don't work their &s;hips as we do ours. They always bring their &s;hips too under a Fore&s;ail and Mizan, but never under a Main&s;ail and Mizan, nor yet under the Mizan alone; but we generally bring too under Main&s;ail and Mizan; and if the Wind grows too fierce we bring her under a Mizan only; and if we cannot maintain that, then we bala&s;t our Mizan: which is by riffing and taking up great part of the Sail. If after all this, the Winds and Seas are two high for us, then we put before it, but not before we have tryed our utmo&s;t, e&s;pecially if we are near a Lee&s;hore. On the contrary, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> (as I &s;aid before) lye under a Fore&s;ail and Mizan: But this mu&s;t needs be an extraordinary &s;train to a Ship, e&s;pecially if &s;he be long. Indeed there is this convenience in it, when they are minded to put away before it, 'tis but halling up the Mizan, and the Fore&s;ail veers the Ship pre&s;ently: and I judge it is for that Rea&s;on they do it. For when the Wind comes on &s;o fierce that they can no longer keep on a Wind, they put right afore it, and &s;o continue till the Storm cea&s;eth, or the Land takes them up (<HI>i. e.</HI> till they are run a-&s;hore.) I knew two <HI>Spaniards</HI> did &s;o, while I was in the Bay. One was a Kings &s;hip, called the <HI>Pi&s;cadore.</HI> She run a&s;hore on a Sandy Bay, a Mile to the We&s;tward of the River <HI>Toba&s;co.</HI> The other was come within 4 or 5 Leagues of the &s;hore, and the Storm cea&s;ing, &s;he e&s;caped &s;hipwreck, but was taken by Captain <HI>Hewet,</HI> Commander of a Privateer, who was then in the Bay. Her Mainma&s;t and Mizan were cut down in the &s;torm. Both the&s;e Ships came from <HI>La Vera Cruz,</HI> and were in the North &s;ide of the Bay when fir&s;t the &s;torms took them. And tho' we don't n&s;e this method, yet we find means to wear our &s;hips as well as they; for if after the Mizan is hall'd up
<PB N="64" REF="397">
and furled, if then the &s;hip will not wear, we mu&s;t do it with &s;ome Head&s;ail, which yet &s;ometimes puts us to our &s;hifts. As I was once in a very violent &s;torm, &s;ailing from <HI>Virginia,</HI> mentioned in my <HI>Voy|age round the World,</HI> we &s;cudded before the Wind and Sea &s;ome time, with only our bare Poles; and the &s;hip by the mi&s;take of him that con'd, broched too, and lay in the Trough of the Sea; which then went &s;o high that every Wave threatned to overwhelm us. And indeed if any one of them had broke in up|on our Deck, it might have foundred us. The Ma&s;ter, who&s;e fault this was, rav'd like a mad Man, and called for an Axe to cut the Mizan Shrouds, and turn the Mizan Ma&s;t over Board: which indeed might have been an Expedient to bring her to her cour&s;e again. Cap. <HI>Davis</HI> was then Quarter-ma&s;ter, and a more ex|perienced Seamen than the Ma&s;ter. He did him hold his hand a little, in hopes to bring her &s;ome other way to her cour&s;e: The Captain al&s;o was of his Mind. Now our Main-yard and Fore-yard were lowered down a Port la&s;t, as we call it, that is down pretty nigh the Deck, and the Wind blew &s;o fierce that we did not dare to loo&s;e any Head-&s;ail, for they mu&s;t have blown away if we had, neither could all the Men in the &s;hip have furled them again; there|fore we had no hopes of doing it that way. I was at this time on the Deck with &s;ome others of our Men; and among the re&s;t one Mr. <HI>John Small<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">on,</HI> who was the main In&s;trument at that time of &s;aving us all. Come &s;aid he to me, let us g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> a little way up the Fore-&s;hrouds, it may be that may make the Ship wear; for I have been doing it before now. He never tarried for an An&s;wer, but run for|ward pre&s;ently, and I followed him. We went up the Shrouds Half-ma&s;t up, and there we &s;pread abroad the Flaps of our Coats, and pre&s;ently the Ship wore. I think we did not &s;tay there above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Minutes before we gain'd our. Point and came dow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="65" REF="398">
again, but in this time the Wind was got into our Main&s;ail, and had blown it loo&s;e; and tho' the Main-yard was down a Port-la&s;t and our Men were got on the Yard as many as could lye one by ano|ther, be&s;ides the Deck full of Men, and all &s;triving to furl that Sail, yet could we not do it, but were forced to cut it all along by the Head-rope, and &s;o let it fall down on the Deck.</P>
<P>Having largely treated of Norths, I &s;hall next give &s;ome account of Souths.</P>
<P>South Winds are al&s;o very violent Winds. I have not heard any thing of the&s;e &s;orts of Storms, but at <HI>Jamaica</HI> or by <HI>Jamaica</HI> Sailers. The time when they blow at <HI>Jamaica</HI> is about <HI>June, July or Augu&s;t,</HI> Months that Norths never blow in. The greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s of Wind in the&s;e &s;torms is at South, from whence its probable they are named <HI>Souths.</HI> In what they differ from the <HI>Hurricanes</HI> that rage among the <HI>Carribee I&s;lands,</HI> I know not, unle&s;s in this, that they are more Con&s;tant to one Point of the Compa&s;s, or that they come &s;ooner in the Year than <HI>Hurricanes</HI> do, but tho&s;e Storms call'd <HI>Hurri|canes,</HI> had never been known at <HI>Jamaica</HI> when I was there. Yet &s;ince I have heard that they have felt the fury of them &s;everal times. But I was at <HI>Jamaica</HI> when there happened a violent South. It made great havock in the Woods; and blew down many great Trees; but there was no great damage done by it. <HI>Port Royal</HI> was in great danger then of being wa&s;hed away, for the Sea made a breach clear through the Town; and if the violence of Wea|ther had continued but a few hours longer, many of the Hou&s;es had been wa&s;hed away: For the Point of Land on which that Town &s;tands, is Sand; which began to wa&s;h away apace: but the Storm cealing, there was no further damage. This was in <HI>July</HI> or <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> in the Year 1674.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="399">
I was afterwards in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> when we had a much more violent Storm than this, called al&s;o by the Logwood-Cutters a <HI>South.</HI> It happened &s;ome time in <HI>June</HI> 1676.</P>
<P>I was then cutting Logwood in the We&s;tern Creek of the We&s;t Lagune. Two days before this &s;torm began, the Wind whiffled about to the South, and back again to the Ea&s;t, and blew very faintly. The Weather al&s;o was very fair, and the Men-of War-Birds came hovering over the Land in great numbers; which is very unu&s;al for them to do. This made &s;ome of our Logwood-Cutters &s;ay, that we &s;hould have &s;ome Ships come hither in a &s;hort time; for they believed it was a certain token of the arrival of Ships, when the&s;e Birds came thus ho|vering over the Land. And &s;ome of them &s;aid they had lived at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> where it was generally taken notice of: and that as many of the&s;e Birds as they &s;aw hovering over the Town, &s;o many Ships there were coming thither. And according to that Rule they fooli&s;hly gue&s;t that here were a great many Ships coming hither at that time: Tho' 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible that they could imagine there could be the hundredth part of the Ships arrive, that they &s;aw Birds fly over their Heads. But that which I did mo&s;t admire was, to &s;ee the Water keep ebbing for two Days together, without any flood, till the Creek, where we lived, was almo&s;t dry. There was commonly at low Water 7 or 8 foot Water; but now not above 3, even in the middle of the Creek.</P>
<P>About 4 a Clock the 2d day after this unu&s;ual Ebb, the Sky looked very black, and the Wind &s;prung up fre&s;h at S. E. and increa&s;ing. In le&s;s than two hours time it blew down all our Huts, but one; and that with much labour we propt up with Po&s;ts, and with Ropes ca&s;t over the Ridge, and fa&s;tning both ends to &s;tupms of Trees, we &s;ecured the Roof from flying away. In it we huddled altogether till the &s;torm cea&s;ed. It
<PB N="67" REF="400">
rained very hard the greate&s;t part of the &s;torm, and about two hours after the Wind fir&s;t &s;prang up, the Waters flowed very fa&s;t in. The next Morning it was as high as the Banks of the Creek: which was higher than I had ever &s;een it before.</P>
<P>The Flood &s;till increa&s;ed, and run fa&s;ter up the Creek than ever I &s;aw it do in the greate&s;t Spring-Tide; which was &s;omewhat &s;trange, becau&s;e the Wind was at South, which is right off the &s;hore on this Coa&s;t. Neither did the Rain any thing a bate, and by 10 a Clock in the Morning the Banks of the Creek were all overflown. About 12 at Noon we brought our Canoa to the &s;ide of our Hut, and fa&s;tned it to the &s;tump of a Tree that &s;tood by it; that being the only refuge that we could now ex|pect; for the Land a little way within the Banks of the Creek is much lower than where we were: So that there was no walking through the Woods becau&s;e of the Water. Be&s;ides, the Trees were torn up by the Roots, and tumbled down &s;o &s;trange|ly a-cro&s;s each other, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s through them.</P>
<P>The &s;torm continued all this Day and the Night, following till 10 a Clock: then it began to abate, and by two in the Morning it was quite calm.</P>
<P>This &s;torm made very &s;trange work in the Woods by tearing up the Trees by the Roots: The Ships al&s;o riding at <HI>Tri&s;l</HI> and at <HI>One-Bu&s;h-Key,</HI> felt the fury of it to their &s;orrow; for of four that were riding at <HI>One-Bu&s;h-Key,</HI> three were driven away from their Anchors, one of which was blown into the Woods of <HI>Beef-I&s;land.</HI> And of the four Ships that were at <HI>Tri&s;t,</HI> three al&s;o were driven from their Anchors, one of which was ca&s;t up about 20 Paces beyond high Water Mark on the <HI>I&s;land</HI> of <HI>Tri&s;t.</HI> The other two were driven off to Sea; and one of them was never heard of &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="401">

<P>The&s;e are violent &s;torms, raging chiefly among the <HI>Carribee I&s;lands;</HI> though, by Relation, <HI>Jamaica</HI> has of late been much annoyed by them; but it has been &s;ince the time of my being there. They are expected in <HI>July, Augu&s;t</HI> or <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e &s;torms al&s;o as well as the Norths or Souths, give &s;ome &s;igns of their approach before they come on. I have not been in any one of them my &s;elf, but have made enquiry of many Men that have, and they all agree that either they are pre|ceded by flattering unu&s;ual &s;mall Winds and very fair Weather, or by a great glut of Rain, or el&s;e by both Rains and Calms together.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give an In&s;tance of one that gave &s;uch war|ning. It happened at <HI>Antego</HI> in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1681. I had the Relation of it from Mr. <HI>John Smallbone,</HI> before mentioned, who was Gunner of a Ship of 120 Tuns and 10 Guns, Commanded by Capt. <HI>Gadbury.</HI></P>
<P>Before this &s;torm it rained two days exce&s;&s;ively, then it held up two or three days more: but the Sky was clouded and appear'd to be much troubled, yet but little Wind. The Planters by this, were certain of a Hurricane, and warned the Ship-Commanders to provide for it, e&s;pecially Capt. <HI>Gadbury;</HI> who had careen'd his Ship in <HI>Muskito Cove</HI> in <HI>St. John's Harbour,</HI> but a little before, and by this warning given him by the Planters, had gotten his Goods on
<PB N="69" REF="402">
Board again, which though all he had, yet was but about half his lading of Sugar, Molo&s;&s;es and Rum. He al&s;o moored his Ship as &s;ecure as he could, with all his Cablesand Anchors, be&s;ides &s;ome Cables which he had made fa&s;t a&s;hore to great Trees. And about 7 a Clock that evening that the &s;torm came, he drea|ding it, went a&s;hore with all his Men, and retired in|to a poor Planters Hou&s;e about half a Mile from the &s;hore. By that time he and his Men were arrived at the Hou&s;e, which was before 8 a Clock; the Wind came on very fierce at N. E. and veering about to the N. and N. W. &s;ettled there, bringing with it very violent Rains. Thus it continued about four hours, and then fell flat calm, and the Rain cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this Calm he &s;ent 3 or 4 of his Men down to the <HI>Cove</HI> to &s;ee what condition the Ship was in, and they found her driven a&s;hore dry on the Sand, lying on one &s;ide, with the Head of her Ma&s;t &s;ticking into the Sand; after they had walked round her and view'd her a while, they return'd again to the Capt. to give him an Account of the Di&s;a&s;ter, and made as much ha&s;te as they could, becau&s;e the Wind began to blow hard at S. W. and it blew &s;o violently before they recover'd the Hou&s;e, that the Boughs of the Trees whipt them &s;ufficiently before they got thither; and it rained as hard as before. The little Hou&s;e could &s;carce &s;helter them from the wet; for there was little be&s;ide the Walls &s;tanding: For the 1&s;t Norther|ly Gu&s;t blew away great part of the Ridg and mo&s;t of the Thatch. Yet there they &s;tayed till the next Morning, and then coming to the Ship found her almo&s;t upright; but all the Goods that were in the Hold were wa&s;h'd out, and the Sugar was wa&s;h'd out of the Cask. Some of the Rum they found; a Cask in one place and a Cask in another: &s;ome on the &s;hore, and &s;ome half a Mile in the Woods; and &s;ome &s;tav'd again&s;t the Trees and leek'd out; for it &s;eems there had been a violent Motion in the Sea, as well
<PB N="70" REF="403">
as in the Air. For in the beginning of the Night when the N. E. Gu&s;t raged, the Sea ebb'd &s;o prodi|giou&s;ly, or el&s;e was driven off the &s;hore by the vio|lence of the Wind &s;o far, that &s;ome Ships riding in the Harbour in 3 or 4 fathom Water, were a ground; and lay &s;o till the S. W. Gu&s;t came, and then the Sea came rowling in again with &s;uch prodigious fury, that it not only &s;et them a-float, but da&s;h'd many of them on the &s;hore. One of them was carried up a great way into the Woods: another was &s;trangely hurl'd on two Rocks that &s;tood clo&s;e by one another; with her Head re&s;ting on one Rock, and her Stern on the other: And thus &s;he lay like a Bridge between the two Rocks, about 10 or 11 Foot above the Sea, even in the highe&s;t Tides; for the Tides do u&s;ually ri&s;e here but lit|tle, not above 2 or 3 Foot, but in the&s;e Hurricanes it always ebbs and flows again prodigiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>It was not the Ships only that felt the fury of this Storm, but the whole I&s;land &s;uffered by it; for the Hou&s;es were blown down, the Trees tore up by the Roots, or had their Heads and Limbs &s;adly &s;hat|tered, neither was there any Leaves, Herbs or green Thing left on the I&s;land, but all look'd like Winter. In&s;omuch that a Ship coming thither a little after, that u&s;ed that Trade, could &s;carce believe it to be the &s;ame I&s;land. Neither did the fury of this Storm light only here, for <HI>Nevis</HI> and St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> had their &s;hares al&s;o; but <HI>Mount&s;urat</HI> felt little of it, tho' not above a Fortnight after there happened a|nother Storm, as violent as this, and raged extream|ly there, but did little damage at <HI>Nevis</HI> and St. <HI>Chri|&s;tophers. Antego</HI> had a great &s;hare of this too. Capt. <HI>Gadbury</HI>'s Ship, that lay a-ground before it came, was by it hurled over to the oppo&s;ite part of the Harbour, and there thrown dry on the Sand.</P>
<P>The day after the &s;torm, the &s;hore was &s;trew'd with Fi&s;h of divers &s;orts, as well great as &s;mall;
<PB N="71" REF="404">
&s;uch as Porpoi&s;es, Sharks, &amp;c. and abundance of Sea Fowls al&s;o were de&s;troyed by it.</P>
<P>I would not have any Man think that the&s;e Hur|ricanes, or any other Storms, do always give warn|ing of their coming exactly alike: For there may be &s;ome difference in tho&s;e &s;igns, tho' all of them be plain enough if well ob&s;erved. Be&s;ides &s;ome|times they are duplicated, &s;ometimes only &s;ingle &s;igns, and &s;ometimes the &s;igns may be more vi&s;ible and plain than at other times: when by &s;ome acci|dental cau&s;e tho&s;e &s;igns may be le&s;s vi&s;ible by Rea&s;on of &s;ome high Hill or Mountain that may be inter|pos'd between you and the Horizon, e&s;pecially if any Hill lies N. E. from you, which is the Quarter that Hurricanes do commonly ri&s;e in.</P>
<P>The Clouds that precede a Hurricane are differ|ent from the North Banks, in this, that whereas the Clouds preceding Norths are uniform and regular; of an exact blackne&s;s even from the Horizon to the upper edg of it, and that as &s;treight and even as a Line &s;tretched out. On the contrary, the Hurricane-Clouds tower up their Heads, pre&s;&s;ing forwards as if they all &s;trove for precedency; yet &s;o linked one within another, that all move alike. Be&s;ides, the edges of the&s;e Clouds are guilded with various and afrighting Colours, the very edg of all &s;eems to be of a pale fire colour, next that of a dull yellow, and nearer the Body of the Cloud of a Copper Colour, and the Body of the Cloud which is very thick ap|pears extraordinary Black: and altogether it looks very terrible and amazing even beyond expre&s;&s;ion. Tho' I have never been in any Hurricane in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> yet I have &s;een the very Image of them in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> and the effects have been the very &s;ame; and for my part I know no difference between a Hurricane among the Carribee I&s;lands in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and a Tuffoon on the Coa&s;t of <HI>China</HI> in the
<PB N="72" REF="405">
<HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> but only the Name&punc; And I am apt to believe that both Words have one &s;ignification, which is a <HI>violent Storm.</HI></P>
<P>I have given a large Account of one of the&s;e in my <HI>Voyage round the World:</HI> Chapter XV. Page 414. That gave warning by flattering Wea|ther before hand, and a very di&s;mal Cloud, &s;et out with &s;uch colours as I have before de&s;cribed, ri&s;ing in the N. E. from whence the violence of the fir&s;t Gu&s;t came, which was wonderful fierce and accom|panied with extraordinary hard Rain; then it af|terwards fell calm about an hour, and then the Wind came about at S. W. and blew as fierce as it did before at N. E. which is much like the Hurri|cane before-mentioned at <HI>Antego,</HI> but of a longer continuance than that: Be&s;ides, in both places they blow at one time of the Year, which is in <HI>July, Augu&s;t</HI> or <HI>September;</HI> and commonly near the Full or Change of the Moon.</P>
<P>Another thing that we mu&s;t al&s;o take notice of is, that both Places are North of the Equator, though not exactly in one Latitude.</P>
<P>But of the&s;e Tuffoons I &s;hall &s;ay no more now, having de&s;cribed them particularly in my Voyage to <HI>Tonquin,</HI> Chap. II. Pag. 36.</P>
<P>The Mon&s;oons in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> are the next to be treated of; by which I do not mean the Coa&s;t|ing Trade-wind, &s;o called, which I have already de&s;cribed in Page 21. of this Di&s;cour&s;e; for tho' [<HI>Mon&s;oon</HI>] is a general word for the Wind there, di&s;tingui&s;hed by Ea&s;t or We&s;t, according to the Points from whence they blow; yet it &s;ometimes al&s;o &s;ignifies a <HI>Storm,</HI> as I now take it. And it is ea&s;ie to be under&s;tood, when it is u&s;ed in reference to the Trade-wind, or when &s;poken of a Storm; for if applied to a Storm, 'tis expre&s;s'd by &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">pethite going before: As Violent, Terrible,
<PB N="73" REF="406">
&amp;c. without any di&s;tinction of Ea&s;t or We&s;t, which is commonly u&s;ed in &s;peaking of the Trade-Wind.</P>
<P>The&s;e Mon&s;oons or Storms on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Co|romandel</HI> are expected either about <HI>April</HI> or <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> which are accounted the two &s;hifting Months. For in the&s;e two Months the Winds be|gin to &s;hift and turn from that Point, on which they have blown &s;everal Months before, to the con|trary Points of the Compa&s;s; as from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, or the contrary: but commonly this &s;hift is attend|ed with a turbulent Sky, which ends in a violent &s;torm of Wind, or exce&s;&s;ive Rains, or both: And this is called al&s;o the breaking up of the Mon&s;oon. It was in one of the&s;e that I pa&s;t from <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;land to <HI>Sumatra,</HI> mentioned in my <HI>Voyage round the World,</HI> Chap. XVIII. Page 496. This was the <HI>April</HI> Mon&s;oon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Septemb</HI> Mon&s;oons are generally more vio|lent than the&s;e la&s;t: yet by the Account I have late|ly had from <HI>Fort</HI> St. <HI>George,</HI> they have &s;uffered ve|ry much by one of the <HI>April</HI> Mon&s;oons (if it may be &s;o called) for it came before its u&s;ual time, even before it could be expected.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>September</HI> Mon&s;oons, tho' the time of the Year is &s;o well known, and the warnings of their approach almo&s;t certain; yet our <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Merchants have had very con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es there; for the &s;tre&s;s of the Winds blows right in upon the &s;hore, and often hurries the Ships from their An|chors, and to&s;&s;es them in a moment on the &s;andy Bay.</P>
<P>Indeed the want of a &s;ecure Place to Ride in, is the greate&s;t Inconvenience of that Factory, a Place doubtle&s;s de&s;igned by the Engli&s;h from its Original to be the Center of the Trade of the&s;e Parts. For all our Factories, and the Trade in general, Ea&s;t from Cape <HI>Comorin,</HI> are now &s;ubordinate to this.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="407">
The <HI>Dutch</HI> had once a place of Con&s;equence, called <HI>Pallacat,</HI> on this Coa&s;t, about 20 Leagues to the North of it; but they withdrew mo&s;t of their Families and Effects from thence in the Year 1691. mentioned in my <HI>Voyage round the World,</HI> Chap. XX. Page 522. And it is very probable that the&s;e rag|ing Winds might be one cau&s;e of this their de&s;ert|ing it, whatever was the Motive of &s;ettling here; for they have &s;ecure Harbours, and Roads enough in <HI>India,</HI> which we to our great di&s;advantage very much want.</P>
<P>But to return to the Mon&s;oons.</P>
<P>The&s;e (as I have told you) blow fierce&s;t in <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> and, as I have been informed, blow on &s;e|veral Points of the Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;tormy Mon&s;oons on the <HI>Mallabar</HI> Coa&s;t differ from the&s;e on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> in that they are more common, and la&s;t even from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>September,</HI> which is as long as the common We&s;t Mon&s;oon la&s;ts, though not &s;o frequent and la&s;ting in the beginning of the Mon&s;oon, as to|wards the latter end.</P>
<P>The Months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> afford very bad Weather, for then there is hardly any intermi&s;&s;ion; but a continued troubled Sky full of black Clouds which pour down exce&s;&s;ive Rains, and often very fierce Winds. But towards the breaking up of the Mon&s;oon, they have one very terrible Storm called by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> the <HI>Eliphanta,</HI> which con|cludes the bad Weather. For after that they put to Sea without fear of any more Storms that Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e violent Winds blow directly in upon the &s;hore; and they dam up the Harbours on this Coa&s;t, e&s;pecially that of <HI>Goa,</HI> &s;o that no Ships can go in or come out then; but after the violent Winds are pa&s;t, the Channel opens again, and &s;o continues till the next Sea&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Sea&s;ons of the Year.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Wet and Dry Sea&s;ons on the North &s;ide of the Equator; and on the South of it. Places fa|mous for much dry Weather; as part of <HI>Peru,</HI> and <HI>Africa.</HI> A Compari&s;on between tho&s;e Coa&s;ts. Of raining Coa&s;ts; as <HI>Guinea.</HI> Why <HI>Guinea</HI> more &s;ubject to Rains than the oppo&s;ite Coa&s;t of <HI>Brazil.</HI> The time of Sugar-making.

Mountains more &s;ubject to Rains than Low Land; An in&s;tance of this at <HI>Ja|maica.</HI> The I&s;le of <HI>Pines</HI> near <HI>Cuba,</HI> a wet Place. So is al&s;o <HI>Gorgonia</HI> in the South Seas. The manner how Tornadoes ari&s;e.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS Summer and Winter are the two mo&s;t different Sea&s;ons in our Climate; &s;o the Dry and the Wet are within the torrid Zone; and are always oppo&s;ite to each other. They are often called by Europeans <HI>Winter</HI> and <HI>Summer,</HI> but more generally, <HI>Dry</HI> and <HI>Wet.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea&s;ons on each &s;ide of the Equator, are as different as the Sea&s;ons of Summer and Winter are in temperate Climates, or near each Pole. For as 'tis Sum|mer near the North Pole, when 'tis Winter near the South Pole, and the contrary: &s;o when 'tis fair and
<PB N="77" REF="410">
dry Weather North of the Equator, 'tis blu&s;tering and rainy Weather South of it, and the contrary; except within a few degrees of the Line, and that in &s;ome places only.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o this difference between the Torrid and Temperate Zones, either North or South of the Equator; that when it is fair and dry Weather in the one, it is Winter in the other: and when it is wet in the one, it is Summer in the other. I &s;peak now of Places lying on the &s;ame &s;ide of the Equator: For as the Sun when it pa&s;&s;es the Equinox, and draws towards either of the Tropicks, begins to warm their re&s;pective Poles, and by how much the nearer he approaches, by &s;o much is the Air without the Tro|picks clear, dry and hot. On the contrary, within the Torrid Zone (though on the &s;ame &s;ide of the Line) the farther the Sun is off, the drier is the Weather. And as the Sun comes nearer, the sky grows more cloudy and the Weather more moi&s;t: for the Rains follow the Sun, and begin on either &s;ide of the Equator, within a little while after the Sun has cro&s;t the Equinox, and &s;o continue till after his return back again.</P>
<P>The wet Sea&s;on on the North &s;ide of the Equator in the torrid Zone, begins in <HI>April</HI> or <HI>May,</HI> and &s;o continues till <HI>September</HI> or <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>The dry Weather comes in <HI>November</HI> or <HI>De|cember,</HI> and continues till <HI>April</HI> or <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>In South Latitudes the Weather changes at the &s;ame times, but with this difference, that the dry Months in South Latitude, are wet Months in North Latitude, and the contrary, as I have &s;aid before. Yet neither do the wet or dry Sea&s;ons &s;et in or go out exactly at one time, in all Years; neither are all places &s;ubject to wet or dry Weather alike. For in &s;ome places it rains le&s;s than in others; and con&s;e|quently there is more dry Weather. But generally
<PB N="78" REF="411">
Places that lye under the Line, or near it, have their greate&s;t Rains in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>Head-Lands or Coa&s;ts that lye mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the Trade-winds have commonly the be&s;t &s;hare of dry Weather. On the contrary, deep Bays or bendings of the Land, e&s;pecially &s;uch as lye near the Line, are mo&s;t &s;ubject to Rains. Yet even a|mong Bays or Bendings, there is a great deal of difference in the Weather as to dry or wet; for the Weather, as well as the Winds &s;eem to be much influenced by accidental Cau&s;es; and tho&s;e Cau&s;es them&s;elves, whatever they are, &s;eem to be &s;ubject to great variation.</P>
<P>But to proceed with Matter of Fact; I &s;hall be|gin with the drie&s;t Coa&s;ts; and fir&s;t with that of <HI>Peru,</HI> from 3 d. South 30 d. South. There it never Rains, neither at Sea for a good di&s;tance off &s;hore, as for 250 or 300 Leagues; no nor on the &s;hore for a con&s;iderable way within Land; though exactly how far I know not; yet there are &s;mall Mi&s;ts, &s;ometimes in a Morning for two or three Hours; but &s;eldom continuing after 10 a Clock; and there are Dews al&s;o in the Night.</P>
<P>This Coa&s;t lies N. and S. it has the Sea open to the We&s;t, and a chain of very high Mountains running a long &s;hore on the Ea&s;t, and the Winds con&s;tantly Southerly, as I &s;aid before in the &s;econd Chapter of Winds.</P>
<P>In which Head I have made a Compari&s;on as well of the Winds on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> in the &s;ame Latitude, as of the lying of the Coa&s;ts. Only there is this difference, that the coa&s;ting Trade-winds on the American &s;ide do blow further from the Land than tho&s;e on the African &s;ide. Which difference may probably ari&s;e from the di&s;porportion of the Mountains that are in the two Continents; for 'tis known that the <HI>Andes</HI> in <HI>America</HI> are &s;ome of the highe&s;t Mountains in the World, but whether there
<PB N="79" REF="412">
are any on the Continent of <HI>Africa</HI> in tho&s;e Lati|tudes &s;o high, I know not. I have not heard of any, at lea&s;t none &s;uch are vi&s;ible to Seamen.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;peak of the Weather on the A|frican Coa&s;t, which though 'tis not &s;o dry as the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru,</HI> yet is it the next to it. The Wea|ther there is very dry from <HI>March</HI> till <HI>October,</HI> which is the dry Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>The rainy Sea&s;on, which is from <HI>October</HI> till <HI>March,</HI> is moderate, without that exce&s;s that is in mo&s;t other Places in tho&s;e Latitudes; &s;o that the wette&s;t Sea&s;on can only be called &s;o from &s;ome gen|tle &s;howers of Rain.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Tornadoes, but not &s;o many as are in any other Places, both of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> or <HI>We&s;t In|dies,</HI> the <HI>Peruvian Coa&s;t</HI> excepted. And if the height of the <HI>Andes</HI> are the cau&s;e that the true Ea&s;t Breez does not take place in the Pacifick Sea, with|in 200 Leagues di&s;tance from the &s;hore, when yet the Trade blows within 40 Leagues of the African Coa&s;t; that Coa&s;t may perhaps be &s;uppo&s;ed to want &s;uch high Mountains. And if tho&s;e American Mountains do &s;top the Winds from their Career, why may they not as well break the Clouds before they reach near the &s;hore, and be the cau&s;e of the dry Weather there? And &s;eeing both Coa&s;ts do lye alike, and the Wind is alike; why &s;hould not the Weather be the &s;ame; were it not for the di&s;pro|portion between the Mountains of the&s;e Coa&s;ts? For the Ea&s;t &s;ide of tho&s;e Mountains are &s;upplied with Rain enough, as may be known by the great Rivers that di&s;embogue from thence into the Atlantick Sea; whereas the Rivers on the South Sea Coa&s;t are but very few and &s;mall; &s;ome of which do wholly dry away for a good part of the Year; but yet they con|&s;tantly break out again in their Sea&s;ons, when the Rains in the Country do come, which always fall on
<PB N="80" REF="413">
the We&s;t &s;ide of tho&s;e Mountains, and this is a|bout <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>As I have &s;poken before of dry Coa&s;ts, &s;o now I &s;hall &s;peak of rainy ones. I &s;hall begin with the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> from Cape <HI>Lopos,</HI> which lies one degree South, taking in the Bite or Bending of the Land, and all the Coa&s;t We&s;t from thence, as far as Cape <HI>Palmas.</HI></P>
<P>This is a very wet Coa&s;t, &s;ubject to violent Tornadoes and exce&s;&s;ive Rains, e&s;pecially in <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t:</HI> In tho&s;e Months there is &s;carce any fair Day. This Coa&s;t lies all of it very near the Equator, and no where above 6 or 7 degrees di|&s;tance; &s;o that from its nearne&s;s to the Equator only, we might probably conjecture that it is a rainy Coa&s;t; for mo&s;t places lying near the Line are very &s;ubject to Rains: yet &s;ome more than others; and <HI>Guinea</HI> may be reckoned among the wette&s;t Places in the World. There may be Places where the Rains continue longer, but none are more violent while they la&s;t.</P>
<P>And as its nearne&s;s to the Line may be a great cau&s;e of its moi&s;ture; &s;o by its &s;ituation al&s;o one would gue&s;s that it &s;hould be &s;ubject to a great deal of Rain; becau&s;e there is a great Bite or Bending in of the Land, a little to the North of the Line; and from thence the Land &s;tretcheth We&s;t parallel with the Line. And the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e Circum&s;tances &s;ingly taken, according to my ob&s;ervations do &s;eldom fail, but more e&s;pecially where they both meet. Yet there may be other cau&s;es that may hinder tho&s;e Effects, or at lea&s;t &s;erve to allay the violence of them, as they do on &s;ome other Coa&s;ts. I &s;hall only in&s;tance in the oppo&s;ite Coa&s;t of <HI>America</HI> between the North Cape, which lies North of the Equator, and Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> on <HI>Brazil,</HI> in South Latitude. Now this Land lies much after the Form of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Gui|nea,</HI> with this difference, that one Coa&s;t lies in
<PB N="81" REF="414">
South Lat. the other lies North of the Equator, both of the&s;e Promontories lay parallel with the Equator, and there's not much difference in their di&s;tance from it; but that which makes the diffe|rence is, that one juts out We&s;tward, the other Ea&s;t|ward; and &s;o one is the very We&s;termo&s;t Land of the Continent of <HI>Africa,</HI> the other is the Ea&s;ter|mo&s;t Land of the Continent of <HI>America:</HI> The one has only an eddy Wind, which &s;eems to me to be the Effect of two contrary Winds: The other Coa&s;t lies open to the Trade, and never wants a Breez. And the former is troubled with Tornadoes and violent Rains during the wet Sea&s;on, which is <HI>May, June, July, Augu&s;t</HI> and <HI>September:</HI> But the extreame&s;t wet Months are <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> when it Rains in a manner continually. <HI>April</HI> and <HI>October</HI> al&s;o &s;ometimes are wet Months.</P>
<P>The other Coa&s;t on the <HI>American</HI> Continent, which lies open to the E. and N. E. or S. E. and which enjoys the freer Trade-Wind, is le&s;s &s;ubject to Rain; only as it lies near the Line, it has its part, but not to exce&s;s, nor in any compari&s;on with <HI>Guinea.</HI> And as the Line is to the N. of it, &s;o its wet Months are from <HI>October</HI> till <HI>April,</HI> and the dry Sea&s;on from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>October.</HI> And the&s;e Sea|&s;ons reach even to 6 or 7 degrees North of the Line: Which I do not know to be &s;o in any other part of the World again. Indeed Cape <HI>Lopes</HI> in <HI>Guinea,</HI> is in one degree South, yet participates of the &s;ame Weather that the re&s;t of <HI>Guinea</HI> has, which lies to the North of the Line.</P>
<P>Now the rea&s;on why <HI>Europeans</HI> do account the dry Sea&s;on Summer, and the wet Sea&s;on Winter, is becau&s;e the dry Sea&s;on is their Harve&s;t time, e&s;pe|cially in our Plantations, where we chiefly make Sugar; for then the Canes are as yellow as Gold. They have then indeed le&s;s juice, but that little there is, is very &s;weet. Whereas in the wet Sea&s;on, tho'
<PB N="82" REF="415">
the Canes are ripe, and come to their Maturity; yet do they not yield &s;uch quantities of Sugar, nei|ther is it &s;o good, tho' the pains in boiling it be al&s;o greater. Therefore in Northern Climates, as all our Plantations are in, they commonly begin to work about making of Sugar at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> after the dry Sea&s;on has brought the Canes to a good per|fection. But in South Climates, as on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Brazil,</HI> they begin to work in <HI>July.</HI> Some Pla|ces there are in the North Latitudes al&s;o near the Line, where the Weather bears time with the Sea|&s;ons in South Lat. as at <HI>Suranam,</HI> which tho' it is in North Lat. yet are the Sea&s;ons there the &s;ame as in South Latitudes; but I know not &s;uch another in|&s;tance any where. And tho' the dry Sea&s;on is the time to gather in the Canes, and the wet Sea&s;on to plant, yet are they not &s;o limited as to make u&s;e only of the&s;e Sea&s;ons for either, but do it chiefly for their be&s;t convenience; for they may plant at any time of the Year, and that with good &s;ucce&s;s, e&s;pecially after a moderate &s;hower of Rain, which often happens even in the dry Sea&s;ons.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t proceed.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid before, that Bays have greater quan|tities of Rain than Head-Lands.</P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Campeachy</HI> is a good In&s;tance of this, for the Rains are very great there, e&s;pecially in the Months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> On the contrary, the Coa&s;t from Cape <HI>Catoch,</HI> to Cape <HI>Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cedo,</HI> which lies more expo&s;ed to the Trade, has not near the Rains as the Bay of <HI>Campeachy</HI> hath.</P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Honduras</HI> al&s;o is very wet, and all that bending Coa&s;t from Cape <HI>Gratia de Dios,</HI> even to <HI>Carthagena.</HI> But on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Caraccos,</HI> and about Cape <HI>La Vela,</HI> where the Breezes are more brisk, the Weather is more moderate. Whereas in tho&s;e little Bays between, there is &s;till a difference: For in the Bay of <HI>Mericaya,</HI> which lies a little to
<PB N="83" REF="416">
the Ea&s;t of Cape <HI>La Vela,</HI> there is much more Rain than at or near the Cape.</P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Panama</HI> al&s;o will furni&s;h us with a proof of this, by its Immoderate Rains; e&s;pecially the South &s;ide of it, even from the Gulph of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> to Cape St. <HI>Francis;</HI> the Rains there are from <HI>April</HI> till <HI>November;</HI> but in <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> they are mo&s;t violent.</P>
<P>There are many &s;mall Bays al&s;o We&s;t from the Bay of <HI>Panama,</HI> which have their &s;hares of the&s;e wet Sea&s;ons, as the Gulph of <HI>Dulce, Caldera</HI> Bay, <HI>Amapala,</HI> &amp;c. but to the We&s;t of that, where the Coa&s;t runs more plain and even, there are not &s;uch wet Sea|&s;ons; yet many times very violent Tornadoes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> al&s;o has many Bays that are &s;ub|ject to very violent Rains, as the Bay of <HI>Tonqueen,</HI> that of <HI>Siam,</HI> the bottom and the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Bay of <HI>Bengall.</HI> But on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> which is the We&s;t-&s;ide of that Bay, the Weather is more moderate; that being an even, plain, low Coa&s;t. But on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mallabar,</HI> which is on the We&s;t &s;ide of that Promontory, the Land is high and moun|tainous, and there are violent Rains. Indeed the We&s;t &s;ides of any Continents are wetter than the Ea&s;t &s;ides, the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> only excepted; in the former of which the drine&s;s may be occa&s;ioned (as is &s;aid before) by the height of the <HI>Andes.</HI> And 'tis probable that the violence of the Rains near tho&s;e Mountains falls chiefly on the Ea&s;t-&s;ides of them, and &s;eldom reaches to their Tops: which yet if the Rains do, they may there be broke in pieces, and reach no further. For, among other Ob&s;ervations, I have taken notice, that Mountains are &s;upplied with more Rains than low Lands; I mean the low Land bordering on the Sea. As for in&s;tance, the South &s;ide of <HI>Jamaica</HI> beginning at <HI>Leganea,</HI> and from thence away to the We&s;tward, as far as Black River, including all the plain Land and Savannahs
<PB N="84" REF="417">
about St. <HI>Jago de la Vego, Old Harbour</HI> and <HI>Withy|wood</HI> Savannahs. This is a plain level Country for many Miles lying near Ea&s;t and We&s;t, having the Sea on the South, and bounded with Moun|tains on the North.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Mountains are commonly &s;upplied with Rain before the low Lands. I have known the Rains to have begun there three Weeks before any has fallen in the plain Country, bordering on the Sea; yet every Day I have ob&s;erved very black Clouds over the Mountains, and have heard it Thun|der there. And tho&s;e very Clouds have &s;eemed by their Motion to draw towards the Sea, but have been check'd in their Cour&s;e, and have either returned towards the Mountains again, or el&s;e have &s;pent them&s;elves before they came from thence, and &s;o have vani&s;hed away again, to the great Grief of the Planters, who&s;e Plantations and Cattle have &s;uffered for want of a little Moi&s;ture. Nay, the&s;e Tornadoes have been &s;o nigh, that the Sea Breeze has dyed away, and we have had the Wind fre&s;h out of the Clouds, yet they have vani&s;hed, and yielded no Rain to the low parch'd Lands.</P>
<P>And I think that the want of &s;ea&s;onable Showers is one of the greate&s;t Inconveniencies that this part of the Country &s;uffers; for I have known in &s;ome very dry Years, that the Gra&s;s in the Savannahs has been burned and wither'd for want of Rain, and the Cattle have peri&s;hed thereby for want of Food. The Plantations al&s;o have &s;uffered very much by it; but &s;uch dry Sea&s;ons have not been known on the North-&s;ide of the I&s;land, where the Moun|tains are bordering on the Sea, or at lea&s;t but a lit|tle di&s;tance off it. For there they are &s;upplied with &s;ea&s;onable Showers almo&s;t all the Year, and even in the dry time it &s;elf, near the Full and Change of the Moon. But in the wet Sea&s;on, the Rains are more violent, which is their Inconveni|ence.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="418">
As for the Valleys in the Country, they are not &s;ubject to &s;uch Droughts as the plain Land by the Sea, at lea&s;t I have not ob&s;erved it my &s;elf, nor have I heard it mentioned by others.</P>
<P>The I&s;le of <HI>Pines</HI> near <HI>Cuba,</HI> is &s;o noted a Place for Rain, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> inhabiting near it on <HI>Cuba,</HI> &s;ay, that it Rains more or le&s;s every Day in the Year, at one Place or another. It is generally &s;poken al&s;o and believ'd by Privateers, for it has been oft vi&s;ited by them. I have been there my &s;elf, but cannot confirm that Report. However, it is well known to be a very wet and rainy Place.</P>
<P>It is but a &s;mall I&s;land of about 9 or 10 Leagues long, and 3 or 4 broad; and in the mid&s;t is a high picked Mountain, which is commonly clouded; and the Privateers &s;ay that this Hill draws all the Clouds to it; for if there is not another Cloud to be &s;een any where el&s;e, yet this Hill is &s;eldom or never clear.</P>
<P><HI>Gorgonia</HI> in the South Seas al&s;o has the &s;ame Report. It is much &s;maller than <HI>Pines.</HI> I have mentioned it in my <HI>Voyage round the World.</HI> Chap. VII. Page 172.</P>
<P>This I&s;le lies about 4 Leagues from the Main: but the I&s;le of <HI>Pines</HI> not above 2, and is a great deal bigger than it. The Main again&s;t <HI>Gorgonia</HI> is very low Land; but <HI>Cuba</HI> near <HI>Pines</HI> is pretty high, and the Mountain of <HI>Pines</HI> is much bigger and higher than the Hill of <HI>Gorgonia,</HI> which yet is of a good height, &s;o that it may be &s;een 16 or 18 Leagues off; and tho' I cannot &s;ay that it Rains every Day there, yet I know that it Rains very much and extraordinary hard.</P>
<P>I have been at this I&s;le three times; and always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ound it very rainy, and the Rains very violent. I remember when we touch'd there in our return from Capt. <HI>Sharp,</HI> we boiled a Kettle of Chocolate before we clean'd our Bark; and having every Man
<PB N="86" REF="419">
his Callaba&s;h full, we began to &s;up it off, &s;tanding all the time in the Rain; but I am confident not a Man among us all did clear his Di&s;h, for it rained &s;o fa&s;t, and &s;uch great drops into our Callaba&s;hes, that after we had &s;up'd off as much Chocolate and Rain-water together as &s;ufficed us, our Callaba&s;hes were &s;till above half full; and I heard &s;ome of the Men&s;wear that they could not &s;up it up &s;o fa&s;t as it rained in: At la&s;t I grew tir'd with what I had left, and threw it away; and mo&s;t of the re&s;t did &s;o likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>As Clouds do u&s;ually hover over Hills and Moun|tains, &s;o do they al&s;o keep near the Land. I have mentioned &s;omething of this in my <HI>Voyage round the World,</HI> Chap. X. Page 283. where I have &s;aid, that in making Land we commonly find it Cloudy over the Land, tho' 'tis clear every where be&s;ide: And this may &s;till confirm what I have &s;aid in the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e, that Hills are commonly cloud|ed; for high Land is the fir&s;t di&s;cerned by us, and that, as I &s;aid before, is commonly clouded. But now I &s;hall &s;peak how we find the Clouds, when we are but a little way from Land, either coa&s;ting along the &s;hore, or at an Anchor by it. I hope the Reader will not imagine that I am going to prove that it never Rains at Sea, or but very little there; for the contrary is known to every Body, and I have already &s;aid in this Di&s;cour&s;e of Winds in my fir&s;t Chapter, That there are very frequent Tornadoes in &s;everal Seas, e&s;pecially near the Equator, and more particu|larly in the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Sea. Other Seas are not &s;o much troubled with them; neither is the <HI>Atlantick</HI> &s;o to the North or South of the Line; e&s;pecially at any con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hore, but yet 'tis very probable however, that the Sea has not &s;o great a portion of Tornadoes as the Land hath. For when we are near the &s;hore within the Torrid Zone, we often &s;ec it Rain on the Land, and perceive it to be
<PB N="87" REF="420">
very cloudy there, when it is fair at Sea, and &s;carce a Cloud to be &s;een that way. And tho' we have the Wind from the Shore, and the Clouds &s;eeming to be drawing off, yet they often wheel about again to the Land, as if they were Magnetically drawn that way: Sometimes indeed they do come off a little; but then they u&s;ually either return again or el&s;e in&s;en&s;ibly vani&s;h; and that's the Rea&s;on that Seamen when they are &s;ailing near the Shore and &s;ee a Tornado coming off, they don't much mind it, but cry, <HI>The Land will devour it:</HI> But however, &s;ometimes they fly off to Sea; and 'tis very rare that Tornadoes ari&s;e from thence; for they gene|rally ri&s;e fir&s;t over the Land, and that in a very &s;trange manner; for even from a very &s;mall Cloud ari&s;ing over the top of a Hill, I have often &s;een it increa&s;e to &s;uch a bulk, that I have known it Rain for 2 or 3 Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. This I have ob&s;erved both in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and in the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>North Seas.</HI> And 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for me to for|get how oft I have been di&s;turbed by &s;uch &s;mall Clouds that appeared in the Night. 'Tis u&s;ual with Seamen in tho&s;e parts to &s;leep on the Deck, e&s;peci|ally for Privateers; among whom I made the&s;e Ob|&s;ervations. In Privateers, e&s;pecially when we are at an Anchor, the Deck is &s;pread with Mats to lie on each Night. Every Man has one, &s;ome two; and this with a Pillow for the Head, and a Rug for a Covering, is all the Bedding that is nece&s;&s;ary for Men of that Employ.</P>
<P>I have many times &s;pread my Lodging, when the Evening has promi&s;ed well, yet have been forced to withdraw before Day; and yet it was not a little Rain that would afright me then; neither at its fir&s;t coming could I have thought that &s;uch a &s;mall Cloud could afford &s;o much Rain: And oftentimes both my &s;elf and others have been &s;o deceived by the appearance of &s;o &s;mall a Cloud, that thinking the
<PB N="88" REF="421">
Rain would &s;oon be over, we have lain till we were dropping wet, and then have been forced to move at la&s;t. But to proceed.</P>
<P>I have con&s;tantly ob&s;erved, that in the wet Sea|&s;on we have had more Rain in the Night than in the Day; for tho' it was fair in the Day, yet we &s;eldom e&s;caped having a Tornado or two in the Night. If we had one in the Day, it ro&s;e and came away pre&s;ently, and it may be we had an Hour's Rain, more or le&s;s; but when it came in the Night, tho' there was little appearance of Rain, yet we &s;hould have it 3 or 4 hours toge|ther; but this has commonly been nigh the Shore; and we have &s;een thick Clouds over the Land, and much Thunder and Lightning; and to our appearance, there was more Rain there than we had; and probably out farther off at Sea, there might be &s;till le&s;s, for it was commonly pretty clear that way.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving treated of the <HI>Winds</HI> and <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> of <HI>the Year</HI> in the Torrid Zone, I now come to &s;peak of the <HI>Tides</HI> and <HI>Currents</HI> there.</P>
<P>And by the way Note. That,</P>
<P>By <HI>Tides</HI> I mean Flowings and Ebbings of the Sea, on or off from any Coa&s;t. Which property of the Sea &s;eems to be Univer&s;al, though not re|gularly alike on all Coa&s;ts, neither as to Time nor the height of the Water.</P>
<P>By <HI>Currents</HI> I mean another Motion of the Sea, which is different from Tides in &s;everal Re&s;pects, both as to its Duration, and al&s;o as to its Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Tides may be compar'd to the <HI>Sea</HI> and <HI>Land-Breezes,</HI> in re&s;pect to their keeping near the &s;hoar; tho' indeed they alternately flow and ebb twice in 24 hours. Contrarily the Sea Breezes blow on the &s;hoar by Day, and the Land Winds off from it in the Night, yet they keep this Cour&s;e as duly in a manner as the Tides do. Neither are the Tides, nor tho&s;e Breezes, far from the Land.</P>
<P>Currents may be compar'd to the <HI>Coa&s;ting Trade-Winds,</HI> as keeping at &s;ome farther di&s;tance from the &s;hoar, as the Trade-winds do; and 'tis pro|bable they are much influenced by them.</P>
<P>'Tis a general belief, e&s;pecially among Seamen, That the Tides are governed by the Moon: That their Increa&s;e and Decrea&s;e, as well as their Diur|nal Motions, are influenced by that Planet; tho' &s;ometimes accidental Cau&s;es in the Winds may hinder the true regularity thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="424">
We are taught, as the fir&s;t Rudiments of Navi|gation, to &s;hift our Tides; <HI>i. e.</HI> to know the Time of full Sea in any Place; which indeed is very ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be known by all Engli&s;h Sailors, becau&s;e the Tides are more regular in our Channel, than in other parts of the World.</P>
<P>But my &s;ubject being to &s;peak of the Tides with|in, or near the Tropick, I leave tho&s;e in places nearer <HI>England</HI> to be di&s;cour&s;ed on by Coa&s;ters, who are the only knowing Men in this My&s;tery: They ha|ving by Experience gained more knowledge in it than others; and that is always the be&s;t Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I have not been on any Coa&s;t in the World, but where the Tides have ebb'd and flow'd, either more or le&s;s; and this I have commonly ob&s;erv'd, that the greate&s;t Indraughts of Rivers or Lagunes, have commonly the &s;tronge&s;t Tides. Contrarily &s;uch Coa&s;ts as are lea&s;t &s;upplied with Rivers or Lakes have the weake&s;t Tides; at lea&s;t they are not &s;o per|ceptible. Where there are great Indraughts either of Rivers or Lagunes, and tho&s;e Rivers or Lagunes are wide, tho' the Tide runs very &s;trong into the Mouths of &s;uch Rivers or Lagunes, yet it does not flow &s;o high as in &s;uch Places where the Rivers or Lakes are bounded in a narrow Room, tho' the Tides do run of an equal &s;trength at the Mouths o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Entrances of either. Neither do the Tides flow &s;o much on or about I&s;lands remote from the main Land, as they do on the Coa&s;ts of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t give &s;ome In&s;tances of the&s;e general Ob&s;ervations, and then proceed to Particulars.</P>
<P>The Places that I &s;hall mention &s;hall be &s;uch as I have been in my &s;elf, and where I have made the Ob&s;ervations before mentioned; I &s;hall begin with the Lagune of <HI>Trie&s;t,</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy.</HI></P>
<P>This Place is very remarkable, in that it has two Mouths of a con&s;iderable bigne&s;s; the one is about a Mile and half wide, and about two Mile thro',
<PB N="92" REF="425">
before you come to a Lagune, which is &s;even o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> eight Leagues long, and three wide. The othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mouth is 7 Leagues from it, and is about 2 Mile and half, or 3 Miles wide, and about 2 Miles long before it opens into the Lagune. Be&s;ides, farthe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> within Land there are 3 or 4 more Lagunes le&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> than the former.</P>
<P>The Tides that flow or ebb in all the Lagunes pa&s;s in or out at the two Mouths before-mention|ed, which makes them run very &s;wift, in&s;omuch, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have named that Great Lagune <HI>Laguna Termina,</HI> or, the Lake of Tides; becau&s;e the Tides are &s;o very &s;trong in tho&s;e two Mouths. Yet, tho' the Tides do run &s;o &s;wift at the Mouth of the Lagune, they do not ri&s;e in height proportion|able to that &s;wiftne&s;s; for the greate&s;t Tides here do not ri&s;e or fall above 6 or 7 Foot, except forced by extraordinary Cau&s;es, as Storms, or the like: Of which I have &s;poken before.</P>
<P>I could al&s;o in&s;tance in the Channel; between the 2 Capes of <HI>Virginia,</HI> where the Tides do run very &s;wift; yet the Floods and Ebbs are not proportion|able to the &s;wiftne&s;s of the Tides between the Capes. There are not indeed &s;uch Lagunes, as at <HI>Trie&s;t</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy;</HI> but there are many wide Ri|vers, and abundance of &s;maller Creeks. Be&s;ides, in &s;ome places there is low Land, which is over|flown by the Tides; &s;o that all the Water that runs in with &s;uch &s;wiftne&s;s within the Capes is in&s;en&s;ibly &s;wallowed up there.</P>
<P>The&s;e are in&s;tances of &s;trong Tides, occa&s;ioned by great Indraughts; yet where there is but little Ri|&s;ing and Falling of the Water in compari&s;on with the &s;trength of the Tides at the Mouths of tho&s;e In|draughts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hall next give &s;ome In&s;tances of the great Indraughts, where the Tides flow and ebb much more than in the former Places; tho' the Tide at the Mouths of tho&s;e Indraughts does not run &s;wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> than in tho&s;e Places before-mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="426">
I &s;hall only mention two Rivers in the South Sea, that I have taken Notice of in my <HI>Voyage round the World, (viz.)</HI> the Gulph of <HI>St. Michael;</HI> and the River of <HI>Guiaquill.</HI></P>
<P>In the Gulph of <HI>St. Michael</HI> there are many large Rivers, which all di&s;embogue into a Lagune of 2 or 3 Leagues wide. This Lagune is barrica|doed from the Sea with &s;ome &s;mall low Man|grovy I&s;lands, and between them are Creeks and Channels, through which the Tides make their daily pa&s;&s;es into the Lagune; and from thence in|to the Rivers, and &s;o back again; many times over-flowing the &s;aid I&s;lands, and leaving the tops of the lower Trees above Water.</P>
<P>The Rivers that run into this Lagune are pretty narrow and bounded on each &s;ide with &s;teep Banks, as high as the Floods u&s;e to ri&s;e, and but very little higher. For at High-water, and on a Spring-tide, the Water is almo&s;t, or altogether even with the Land.</P>
<P>The Lagune at the Mouth of the Rivers is but &s;mall, neither is there any other way for the Wa|ter to force it &s;elf into, be&s;ide the Lagune and Rivers; and therefore the Tides do ri&s;e and fall here 18 or 20 Foot.</P>
<P>The River of <HI>Guiaquil,</HI> in this re&s;pect, is much the &s;ame with the Gulph of <HI>St. Michael;</HI> but the Lagunes near it are larger. Here the Tides ri&s;es and fall 16 Foot perpendicular.</P>
<P>I don't know of any other &s;uch Places in all the South Seas; yet there are other large Rivers on the Coa&s;t, between the&s;e Places; but none &s;o remarkable for high Tides. The great Tides in the Gulph of <HI>St. Michael</HI> have doubtle&s;s been the occa&s;ion of that O|pinion, which &s;ome hold, that there's a &s;ubterranean Communication between the North and the South Seas; and that the I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien</HI> is like an Arched Bridge, under which the Tides make their con&s;tant Cour&s;es, as duly as they do under <HI>London-Bridge.</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="427">
And more to confirm this Opinion &s;ome have &s;aid, that there are continual and &s;trange Noi&s;es made by tho&s;e Subterranean Fluxes and Refluxes; and that they are heard by the Inhabitants of the I&s;thmus; and al&s;o that Ships &s;ailing in the Bay of <HI>Panama</HI> are to&s;s'd to and fro at a prodigious rate: Sometimes (&s;ay they) they are by the boiling of the Water, da&s;h'd again&s;t I&s;lands; and in a moment left dry there, or &s;taved in pieces; at other times they are drawn or &s;uck'd up, as 'twere, in a Whirl-pool, and ready to be carried under Ground into the North Seas, with all Sails &s;tanding. They have &s;aid al&s;o, that when the Tide flows, e&s;pecially on a Spring, the I&s;lands in the Bay are all over-flown; nay, and even the Country for a great way together: and then nothing is to be &s;een but the tops of Trees. But if this were &s;o, 'tis much that I, and tho&s;e that I was with, &s;hould not have heard or &s;een &s;omething of it: For I pa&s;s'd the I&s;thmus twice, and was 23 Days in the la&s;t Trip that I made over it; but yet did I never hear of any Noi&s;es under Ground there. I &s;ailed al&s;o in the South Seas (taking in both times that I was there) near 3 Years: and &s;everal Months of it I was in the Bay of <HI>Panama.</HI> And after I went away, tho&s;e of our Crew, that remained there, &s;pent a great deal more time in that Bay. Yet did they never meet with &s;uch &s;trange Whirl-Pools, but found as plea&s;ant &s;ailing there, as any where in the World. Neither did I ever hear any of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Indians</HI> make mention of any &s;uch thing in all my Conver&s;e with them; which certainly they would have done, if they had ever experienced it, had it been only to terrifie us, and &s;care us away from their Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>I remember indeed our Country-man Mr. <HI>Gage,</HI> gives &s;ome hints of the&s;e &s;trange Currents in this Bay, in his Book, called, <HI>A New Survey of the</HI> We&s;t-Indies, from <HI>p.</HI> 538 to 440. but I am afraid he took
<PB N="95" REF="428">
mo&s;t of it upon tru&s;t from others; or el&s;e he was Sea-&s;ick all that little Voyage: for he gives a very imperfect and lame Account of that Bu&s;ine&s;s, as if he under&s;tood not what he wrote. I &s;hould di&s;like his whole Book for that one &s;tories &s;ake, if I did not know that he has writ candidly upon other Matters; but I think I have &s;aid enough of this. To proceed then.</P>
<P>As to the great Tides, which are reported to be in the&s;e Seas, I have given in&s;tances of them, but they are not &s;o great as is reported; neither do they ebb and flow &s;o much any where as in the Gulph of <HI>St. Michael</HI> only: where indeed they flow over tho&s;e &s;mall low Mangrove I&s;lands, at the Mouth of the Lagune, and leave only the tops of the low Trees above Water, for tho&s;e I&s;lands are very low, neither do they afford any high Trees. But however, the I&s;lands at the Mouth of the Gulph, before you come to the&s;e low ones, are near over|flown; yet are they very &s;mall and low, in com|pari&s;on with other I&s;lands in the Bay of <HI>Panama.</HI> And indeed, &s;hould the I&s;lands in that Bay be over|flown, the City of <HI>Panama</HI> would &s;oon be many Yards under Water. But &s;o far is this from being true, that the <HI>Pearl I&s;lands,</HI> which are very flat and low, are yet never overflown. For there the Tide ri&s;eth and falls not above 10 or 11 Foot on a Spring, at the Southermo&s;t end of them, which is almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the Gulph of <HI>St. Michael,</HI> and not above 12 or 14 Leagues di&s;tant from it. And yet there it flows more than it does at or near <HI>Pa|nama,</HI> or any other Place in the Bay (except ju&s;t at the Mouths of Rivers) by 2 or 3 Foot. There|fore all that report is wholly groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>But to go on.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o ob&s;erved, that I&s;lands lying afar off at Sea, have &s;eldom &s;uch high Tides as tho&s;e that are near the Main, or as any Places on the Main it &s;elf;
<PB N="96" REF="429">
as for example, at the <HI>Gallapagos I&s;lands,</HI> which lie about 100 Leagues from the Main; the Tides don't ri&s;e and fall above a Foot and half, or two Foot, which is le&s;s than they do on the Coa&s;t of the Main. For on mo&s;t places of the Main it ri&s;es and falls 2 or 3 Foot, more or le&s;s, according as the Coa&s;t is more or le&s;s expo&s;ed to Indraughts or Rivers.</P>
<P><HI>Guam,</HI> one of the <HI>Ladrone</HI> I&s;lands, is al&s;o another in&s;tance of this. There the Tide ri&s;eth not above 2 or 3 Foot at mo&s;t. In the Bay of <HI>Panama</HI> the Tides do keep a more con&s;tant and regular Cour&s;e than on other places on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Mexico;</HI> it was for that rea&s;on I called them Currents in &s;ome places (mentioned in my <HI>Voyage round the World,</HI> as particularly near <HI>Guatuloa,</HI> on the <HI>Mexi|can Continent,</HI> in Chap. IX. Page 238.) but it was truly a Tide (which there I called a Current) and it &s;ets to the Ea&s;tward as the Ebb doth to the We&s;t. The Tides there do ri&s;e and fall about 5 Foot, as they do on mo&s;t parts of that Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ria Leja</HI> they ri&s;e and fall about 8 or 9 Foot.</P>
<P>At <HI>Amapala</HI> they al&s;o ri&s;e and fall about 8 or 9 Foot, and the Flood there runs to the Ea&s;t, and the Ebb to the We&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Gulph of <HI>Dulce</HI> and <HI>Neicoya</HI> River, they ri&s;e to 10 or 11 Foot; but on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru</HI> they don't ri&s;e &s;o high, e&s;pecially on all the Coa&s;t between Cape <HI>St. Francis</HI> and the River <HI>Guiaquil;</HI> there the Flood runs to the South, and the Ebb to the North.</P>
<P>At the I&s;land <HI>Plata</HI> the Tide ri&s;es and falls 3 or 4 Foot; but from Cape <HI>Blanco,</HI> in about 3 d. South, to 30 d. South, the Tides are &s;maller; there they ri&s;e and fall not above a Foot and a half, or 2 Foot. The Flood on this Coa&s;t &s;ets to the South, and the Ebb to the North.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="430">
In all my Crui&s;ings among the Privateers, I took notice of the ri&s;ings of the Tides; becau&s;e by knowing it, I always knew where we might be&s;t hall a&s;hore and clean our &s;hips: which is al&s;o great|ly ob&s;erved by all Privateers.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t Places of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> the Tide flows but little over what it does in our Channel.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> al&s;o the Tides are but &s;mall on mo&s;t Coa&s;ts, neither are they &s;o regular as with us.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t irregular Tides that I did ever meet with, are at <HI>Tonqueen</HI> in about 20d. North Lati|tude, and on the Coa&s;t of <HI>New Holland,</HI> in about 17d. South. In both the&s;e places, the neap Tides are &s;carce di&s;cernable. Tho&s;e of <HI>Tonqueen</HI> are de&s;cribed at large by Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> who was imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oyed by Mr. <HI>James</HI> when he was chief of the Engli&s;h Factors there, to ob&s;erve them: And the whole Di&s;cour&s;e is publi&s;hed in <HI>The Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions of the Royal Society:</HI> whither I refer you.</P>
<P>At <HI>New Holland</HI> I had two Months time to ob|&s;erve the Tides. There the Flood runs E. by N. and the Ebb W. by S. And they ri&s;e and fall about five Fathom.</P>
<P>In all the Springs that we lay here, the highe&s;t were 3 Days after the Full or Change, and that without any perceptible Cau&s;e in the Winds or Wea|ther. I mu&s;t confe&s;s we were &s;tartled at it; and though &s;ome of us had ob&s;erved it in the Springs, that happened while we lay on the Sand to clean our Ship, (as I have mentioned in my former Volume, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ntituled, <HI>A New Voyage round the VVorld.</HI> Ch.

Page 471.) yet in that Spring that we de&s;igned to hall off, in order to be gone from thence, we did all take more particular notice of it than in the preceding Springs; for many had not taken notice of it before: And therefore the Major part of the Company, &s;uppo&s;ing that it was a mi&s;take in us who made tho&s;e former Ob&s;ervations, expected to hall off the Ship the third Tide after the Change; but our Ship did not float then, nor the next Tide neither, which put them all into an amazement, and a great Con&s;ternation too: For many thought we &s;hould never have got her off at all, but by dig|ging away the Sand; and &s;o clearing a Pa&s;&s;age for her into the Sea. But the &s;ixth Tide cleared all tho&s;e doubts; for the Tide then ro&s;e &s;o high, as to float her quite up; when being all of us ready to work we hall'd her off; and yet the next Tide was higher than that, by which we were now all throughly &s;atisfied, that the Tides here do not keep the &s;ame time as they do in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve, That here was no River, nor Lagune, nor any other Indraught on the Land near us, that might occa&s;ion the&s;e great Tides; tho' 'tis very probable that the great Bending be|tween <HI>New Holland</HI> and <HI>New Guinea,</HI> may have both Rivers and Lagunes, which may cau&s;e the&s;e great Tides; or el&s;e there may be a Pa&s;&s;age of the Sea between both Places; as it is laid down in &s;ome Draughts: Or if neither of the&s;e, there may be at lea&s;t a large and deep Sound.</P>
<P>This is the more probable, becau&s;e of the extraor|dinary Flood that &s;ets to the Ea&s;t-ward in all that Sea, between <HI>New Holland,</HI> and the I&s;lands lying North of it, which we mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly perceived, when we were near <HI>New Holland:</HI> And &s;uch a Tide as this mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have a greater Indraught than barely a River or Lagune; and 'tis the more
<PB N="99" REF="434">
likely &s;till, that this Tide &s;hould have a Pa&s;&s;age through between <HI>New Holland</HI> and <HI>New Guinea,</HI> or at lea&s;t a deep Sound there; becau&s;e it keeps along by the Main, and doth not run in among the I&s;lands to the North of it. And be&s;ides, the Northermo&s;t Promontory of <HI>New Holland</HI> &s;hoots down almo&s;t to the Line, which &s;eems to be a Barrier to it on that &s;ide; therefore it may in rea&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed to have its Pa&s;&s;age &s;ome other way; but of this gue&s;s, I have &s;aid enough.</P>
<P>In the Streights of <HI>Malacca</HI> the Flood &s;ets to the Ea&s;t, and the Ebb to the We&s;t.</P>
<P>I have found the Tides at <HI>Malacca</HI> Town, to ri&s;e and fall about &s;ix Foot on a Spring. I had the Expe|rience of two Spring-Tides, when I was Captain <HI>Minchins</HI> Mate, as is before-mentioned in my Voy|age from <HI>Achin</HI> to <HI>Malacca.</HI></P>
<P>On the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the African Coa&s;t, between the <HI>Cape of good Hope</HI> and the <HI>Red-Sea;</HI> the Tide keeps its con&s;tant Cour&s;e. The Flood runs to the Southward; the Ebb to the North-ward. And at a Spring-tide in the Rivers on that Coa&s;t, the Tide ri&s;es and falls &s;ix Foot, e&s;pecially in the River of <HI>Natal,</HI> in Lat. 30 d. South.</P>
<P>I have this Relation from Capt. <HI>Rogers,</HI> who is a very Ingenious Per&s;on, and well experienced on that Coa&s;t; and is now gone Commander of a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el thither to Trade.</P>
<P>Having already largely treated of Tides, I come now to &s;peak &s;omewhat of Currents.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="435">
CUrrents and Tides differ many ways; for Tides run forward, and back again, twice every 24 Hours: on the contrary Currents run a Day, a VVeek, nay, &s;ometimes more, one way: and then, it may be, run another way.</P>
<P>In &s;ome particular Places they run &s;ix Months one way, and &s;ix Months another.</P>
<P>In other Places they con&s;tantly run one way on|ly a day or two, about full Moon, and then they run &s;trong again&s;t the former Cour&s;e; and after that, return the &s;ame way again:</P>
<P>In &s;ome Places they run con&s;tantly one way, and never &s;hift at all.</P>
<P>The force of Tides is generally felt near the &s;hore; whereas Currents are at a remote di&s;tance; neither are the Effects of them &s;en&s;ibly di&s;cerned by the ri&s;ing or falling away of the VVater as tho&s;e of the Tides are; for the&s;e commonly &s;et along &s;hore.</P>
<P>'Tis generally ob&s;erved by Seamen, that in all Places where Trade-winds blow, the Current is in|fluenced by them, and moves the &s;ame way with the VVinds; but 'tis not with a like &s;wiftne&s;s in all Places; neither is it always &s;o di&s;cernable by us in the wide Ocean, as it is near to &s;ome Coa&s;t; and yet it is not &s;o di&s;cernable neither, very near any Coa&s;t, except at Capes and Promontories, that &s;hoot far forth out into the Sea; and about I&s;lands al&s;o the Effects of them are felt more or le&s;s, as they lye in the way of the Trade-Winds.</P>
<P>I &s;hall In&s;tance <HI>Barbadoes</HI> for one, and all the Carribbes may as well be included.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="436">
The greater I&s;lands as <HI>Hi&s;paniola, Jamaica</HI> and <HI>Cuba</HI> have only &s;ome particular Capes or Head-Lands, expo&s;ed to Currents, as Cape <HI>Tiberoon</HI> on <HI>Hi&s;paniola, Point Pedro,</HI> and the N. E. Point of <HI>Ja|maica, Cape de Cruz, Cape Corientes,</HI> and <HI>Cape Anto|nios</HI> on <HI>Cuba:</HI> But of all the I&s;lands in the <HI>We&s;t-In|dies</HI> there are none more &s;en&s;ible of Currents than <HI>Corri&s;ao</HI> and <HI>Aruba,</HI> nor any Capes on the Conti|nent &s;o remarkable for Currents as <HI>Cape Roman,</HI> which &s;hoots out again&s;t the Sea, between tho&s;e two Places, as al&s;o <HI>Cape Coquibaco</HI> and <HI>Cape La Vela</HI> to Leeward, all three on the &s;ame Head-Land, which &s;hoots forth far, without any other Land on the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>There is no &s;uch Head-Land till you come to <HI>Cape Gratia de Dios,</HI> which is about 260 Leagues to Leeward. Indeed to the Ea&s;tward there is Land that trends out almo&s;t &s;o far, within 150 Leagues of it: <HI>(Viz.)</HI> The I&s;land <HI>Trinidado</HI> and the Land again&s;t it; and there al&s;o are great Currents. But I &s;hall fir&s;t &s;peak of the Currents between <HI>Cape La Vela</HI> and <HI>Cape Gratia de Dios.</HI></P>
<P>The Currents at <HI>Cape La Vela</HI> do &s;eldom &s;hift, therefore Ships that ply to Wind-ward to get about it, do not ply near the &s;hore, but &s;tand off to Sea, till they come in &s;ight of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and then back again, till within about 6 or 8 Leagues of the Cape, but not nearer. But in the We&s;terly Wind-Sea&s;on, which is from <HI>October</HI> till <HI>March,</HI> Ships of|ten meet We&s;terly Winds that la&s;t two or three Days with which they may run to the Ea&s;tward, without any trouble.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Cape La Vela</HI> and <HI>Cape Gratia de Dios,</HI> the Currents are much different from what they are again&s;t the Cape: and this &s;eems to proceed from the make of the Land; for the &s;hore between the
<PB N="102" REF="437">
two Capes, runs into the Southward, making <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> great Bay: And this Bay affords more varieties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Winds and Currents, than any one part of the <HI>VVe&s;t-Indies</HI> be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Here, in the We&s;terly Wind-Sea&s;on, the Cur|rent &s;ets to the We&s;tward con&s;tantly; but &s;ome|times &s;tronger than at other times. At about four Leagues off &s;hore, you find it, and &s;o it continues till you are 20,&mdash;25,&mdash;or 30 Leagues off. Beyond that you meet with an Ea&s;terly Wind; and if there is any Current it runs al&s;o to the We&s;t|ward: therefore Ships that are bound to the We&s;t|ward, mu&s;t run off to Sea Thirty or Forty Leagues to get a Wind, or el&s;e if they have but a little way to go, they mu&s;t ply clo&s;e under the &s;hore, that &s;o they may Anchor when they plea&s;e: O|therwi&s;e they will be carried away to the Ea&s;t|ward, Fourteen or Sixteen Leagues in a Nights time; and that too, tho' they have a faint Ea&s;terly Wind, as frequently they meet with, tho' 'tis the We&s;terly Wind-Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>To the Ea&s;t of <HI>Cape Roman,</HI> as high as the I&s;land <HI>Trinidado,</HI> you meet only a &s;oaking faint Current, &s;etting to the We&s;tward, except only near &s;uch places as &s;hoot out farthe&s;t into the Sea, as about the <HI>Te&s;tegos,</HI> which are &s;mall I&s;lands lying to Wind-ward of the I&s;land <HI>Margarita.</HI> Between tho&s;e I&s;lands and the Main, you meet with a pret|ty &s;trong Current: therefore it is hard getting to the Ea&s;t-ward there; but on all the Coa&s;t, between <HI>Cape Roman</HI> and the Head-Land, &s;hooting out to|wards the <HI>Te&s;tegos,</HI> you may ply up with the Land and Sea-Breezes.</P>
<P>From thence, till you come as high as the Ea&s;t-end of <HI>Trinidado I&s;le,</HI> you meet with an extraordi|nary &s;trong Current.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="438">
From the Ea&s;t-end of <HI>Trinidado,</HI> till you come to <HI>Surinam,</HI> though you meet an Ea&s;terly Current, yet 'tis po&s;&s;ible to beat it up with the Land and Sea-Breezes.</P>
<P>From <HI>Surinam</HI> al&s;o to <HI>Cape Blanco,</HI> you may turn it up, though to be &s;ure you'll meet with Cur|rents &s;etting to the We&s;t; except near the Full of the Moon; and then on all the Coa&s;ts before men|tioned, we commonly meet with Currents, &s;etting to the Ea&s;tward; at lea&s;t then it &s;lackens and &s;tands &s;till, if it doth not run to the Ea&s;t-ward. But when you are come as far to the Ea&s;t as <HI>Cape Blanco,</HI> on the North of <HI>Brazil,</HI> you meet with a Current always again&s;t you; and &s;o from thence Southerly, as far as Cape <HI>St. Augu&s;tine.</HI></P>
<P>There is no dealing with this Promontory; for it &s;hoots out &s;o far into the Sea, and thereby lies &s;o expo&s;ed to the Sea-Breezes and the Currents, that &s;oak down between <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Brazil,</HI> that it is quite contrary to rea&s;on to think there &s;hould not always be a &s;trong Current &s;etting to the N. W</P>
<P>I have before hinted, That in all Places where the Trade blows, we find a Current &s;etting with the Wind, which is not &s;o perceptible in the wide Sea as nearer the Shores; yet even there the force of the Winds con&s;tantly blowing one way, may, and probably does, move the &s;urface of the Water along with it.</P>
<P>From hence it may be inferred, that the Souther|ly Winds on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the true Trade between it and <HI>Brazil,</HI> gently move the &s;urface of the Sea with it, and the Trade being mo&s;tly at S. E. drives the Sea to the Northward, &s;lanting in on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Brazil;</HI> which being there &s;topp'd
<PB N="104" REF="439">
by the Land, bends its Cour&s;e Northerly toward <HI>Cape St. Augu&s;tine:</HI> And after it has doubled that great Promontory, it falls away more gently to|wards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Surinam;</HI> and from thence to|wards the <HI>VVe&s;t-Indies.</HI> For after it has doubled that Promontory, it has more room to &s;pread it &s;elf, and thereby becomes weaker in motion, being agitated by the Trade-winds, which to the North of the Line, we find commonly blowing at E. N. E and this &s;till bears the Sea &s;lanting down along the Coa&s;t to the We&s;tward. And probably 'tis for this rea&s;on, that we find the Current &s;etting &s;tron|ge&s;t near tho&s;e Head-Lands before-mentioned. Whereas at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and other of the Caribbee I&s;lands, we find only a &s;oaking Current, &s;uch as &s;eems to ari&s;e only from the con&s;tancy of the Trade-winds blowing there, and not from an original Current, from the South part of the Atlantick: which, as I &s;aid before, doubles about <HI>Cape St. Augu|&s;tine,</HI> and &s;o Coa&s;ts along pretty nigh the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The Currents about the I&s;land <HI>Trinidado,</HI> and at <HI>Curri&s;ao</HI> and <HI>Aruba,</HI> as al&s;o between them and <HI>Cape Roman</HI> &s;eem to indicate as much. The Cur|rents al&s;o between <HI>Cape Roman,</HI> and <HI>Cape La Vela</HI> indicate the &s;ame.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cape La Vela</HI> the Currents &s;et &s;till to the We&s;tward, towards <HI>Cape Gratia de Dios;</HI> but in a direct Line, and not borrowing or &s;lanting in to|wards the &s;hore. For, as I &s;aid before, it is a large Bay, and Currents commonly &s;et from one Head-Land to another; &s;o that Bays have &s;eldom any; or if they have, they are only Counter Currents. And the&s;e Counter Currents too do &s;et from one Point to another, without interfering with the little Bays between. And 'tis al&s;o very probable that the&s;e Counter Currents, &s;uchas we meet with in this Bay,
<PB N="105" REF="440">
in their Sea&s;ons, after they have &s;urrounded the Bay, and are got as far to the Ea&s;t as <HI>Cape La Vela,</HI> wheel off there, and turn about again with the Stream to the We&s;tward, like an Eddy in a River.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cape Gratia de Dios</HI> the Current &s;ets away N. W. towards <HI>Cape Catoch,</HI> and &s;o pa&s;&s;es away to the Northward, between Cape <HI>Catoch</HI> on <HI>Jucatan,</HI> and Cape <HI>Antonio</HI> on <HI>Cuba.</HI></P>
<P>In the Channel between tho&s;e two Capes, we commonly find a &s;trong Current &s;etting to the Northward: And here I have found them extra|ordinary &s;trong.</P>
<P>On the North &s;ide of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> as you pa&s;s into the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> you meet with a &s;mall &s;oak|ing Current to the We&s;tward, even down to the bot|tom of the Bay of <HI>Mexico;</HI> but on the North &s;ide of the Bay of <HI>Mexico</HI> the Current &s;ets to the Ea&s;t|ward: And 'tis probable that is the rea&s;on, that the Spaniards, coming from <HI>La Vera Cruz,</HI> keep that &s;hore aboard. And 'tis as probable that the Cur|rent, which &s;ets to Leeward, on all the Coa&s;t from Cape <HI>St. Augu&s;tine</HI> to Cape <HI>Catoch,</HI> never enters the Bay of <HI>Mexico;</HI> but bends &s;till to the Northward, till 'tis check'd by the <HI>Florida</HI> &s;hore; and then wheels about to the Ea&s;t, till it comes nearer the Gulphs Mouth, and there joyning with the &s;oaking Current that draws down on the North &s;ides of <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> and <HI>Cuba,</HI> pa&s;&s;es altogether with great &s;trength through the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> which is the mo&s;t remarkable Gulph in the World for its Currents; becau&s;e it always &s;ets very &s;trong to the North. Yet near the &s;hores on each &s;ide this Gulph, there are Tides, e&s;pecially on the <HI>Florida</HI> &s;hore; and Ships may pa&s;s which way they plea&s;e, if they are acquainted.</P>
<P>It has formerly been accounted very dangerous to meet with a North in this Gulph; and for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> our <HI>Jamaica</HI> Ships to avoid them, have rather
<PB N="106" REF="441">

<HEAD>The following Paper, containing a &s;hort De&s;cription of a part of <HI>Africk</HI> that is not well known to <HI>Europeans,</HI> I thought would not be unacceptable to the curious Reader. I have therefore an|nexed it, as I received from my ingenious Friend Capt. <HI>Rogers,</HI> who is lately gone to that Place: and hath been their &s;everal times before.</HEAD>
<P>THE Country of <HI>Natal</HI> takes about 3 d. and half of Lat. from N. to S. lying between the lat of 31 d. 30 m. South and 28 N. 'Tis bounded on the S. by a Country inhabited by a &s;mall Nation of Savage People, called by our Engli&s;h, <HI>Wild|bu&s;h Men,</HI> that live in Caves and in holes of Rocks, and have no other Hou&s;es, but &s;uch as are formed by Nature; They are of a low &s;tature, tauny colour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d, with cri&s;ped Hair: They are accounted very cruel to their Enemies. Their Weapons are Bows and Poi&s;oned Arrows. The&s;e People have for their Neighbours on the S. the <HI>Hottantots. Dellagoa</HI> is a Navigable River in Lat. 28 S. that bounds <HI>Natal</HI> on the N. The Inhabi|tants of this River have a Commerce with the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> of <HI>Mozambique,</HI> who oft vi&s;it them in &s;mall Barks, and trade there for Elephants Teeth; of which they have great plenty. Some Engli&s;h too have lately been there to purcha&s;e Teeth, parti|cularly Capt. <HI>Freak,</HI> ju&s;t mentioned in my former Volume, Ch. 23. P. 51c. who after he had been in the River of <HI>Della|goa,</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="444">
and purcha&s;ed 8 or 10 Tun of Teeth, lo&s;t his Ship on a Rock near <HI>Madaga&s;car.</HI> The Country of <HI>Natal</HI> lies open to the Indian Sea on the Ea&s;t, but how far back it runs to the We&s;t|ward is not yet known.</P>
<P>That part of the Country which re&s;pects the Sea is plain Champion and Woody; but within Land it appears more un|even, by Rea&s;on of many Hills which ri&s;e in unequal Heights above each other Yet is it interlaced with plea&s;ant Valleys and large Plains, and 'tis checker'd with Natural Groves and Savannahs. Neither is there any want of Water; for every Hill affords little Brooks, which glide down &s;everal ways; &s;ome of which, after &s;everal turnings and windings, meet by degrees and make up the River of <HI>Natal,</HI> which di&s;chargeth it &s;elf into the Ea&s;t-Indian Ocean in the Lat. of 30 d. South. There it opens pretty wide and is deep enough for &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;els. But at the Mouth of the River is a Bar which has not above 10 or 11 foot Water on it in a Spring-tide; though within there is Water enough. This River is the principal of the Country of <HI>Natal,</HI> and has been lately frequented by &s;ome of our Engli&s;h Ships particularly by a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el that Captain <HI>Rogers,</HI> formerly mentioned, commanded.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o other Streams and Rivers, which bend their Cour&s;es Northerly, e&s;pecially one of a con&s;iderable bigne&s;s about 100 Mile within Land, and which runs due North.</P>
<P>The Woods are compo&s;ed of divers &s;orts of Trees; many of which are very good Timber, and fit for any u&s;es, they being tall and large. The Savannahs al&s;o are cloathed with kindly thick Gra&s;s.</P>
<P>The Land-Animals of this Country are Lyons, Tigers, Ele|phants, Buffaloes, Bullocks, Deer, Hogs, Conies, &amp;c. Here are al&s;o abundance of Sea-Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Buffaloes and Bullocks only are kept tame, but the re&s;t are all wild.</P>
<P>Elephants are &s;o plenty here that they feed together in great Troops; 1000 or 1500 in a Company; Mornings and Even|ings they are &s;een grazing in the Savannahs, but in the heat of the Day, they retire into the Woods, and they are very peaceable if not mole&s;ted.</P>
<P>Dears are very numerous here al&s;o. They feed quietly in the Savannahs among the tame Cattle, for they are &s;eldom di&s;turbed by the Natives.</P>
<P>Here are Fowls of divers &s;orts; &s;ome &s;uch as we have in <HI>England, viz.</HI> Duck and Teal, both tame and wild: and plen|ty of Cocks an d Hens. Be&s;ides abundance of wild Birds, whol|ly unknown to us.</P>
<P>Here are a &s;ort of large Fowls as big as a Peacock, which have many fine coloured Feathers. They are very rare and &s;hy.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="445">
There are others like Curlews, but bigger. The fle&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e is black, yet &s;weet and whole&s;ome Meat.</P>
<P>The Sea and Rivers al&s;o do abound in Fi&s;h of divers &s;orts yet the Natives do but &s;eldom endeavour to take any, exce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Tortoi&s;es; and that is chiefly when they come a&s;hore in th Night to lay their Eggs.

<P>The Natives of this Country are but of a middle Statur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> yet have very good Limbs: The Colour of their Skins i black: their Hair cri&s;ped: they are oval vi&s;aged: their No&s;e neither flat nor high, but very well proportioned: their Teet are white, and their A&s;pect is altogether graceful.</P>
<P>They are nimble People, but very lazy: which probable: for want of Commerce. Their chief Employment is Husban|dry. They have a great many Bulls and Cows, which the carefully look after; for every Man knows his own, thoug they run all promi&s;cuou&s;ly together in their Savannahs; y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> they have Pens near their own Hou&s;es, where they mak them gentle and bring them to the Pail.

They have Caps made with Beef Tallow of about 9 or 10 Inches high. They are a great while of making the&s;e Caps: for the Tallow mu&s;t be made very pure, before 'tis fit for this u&s;e. Be&s;ides they lay on but a little at a time and mix it finely a|mong the Hair; and &s;o it never afterwards comes off their Heads, When they go a Hunting, which is but &s;eldom, they p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re off 3 or 4 Inches from the top of it, that &s;o it may &s;it the &s;nugger, but the next Day they begin to build it up again; and &s;o they do every Day till 'tis of a decent and fa&s;hionable height.</P>
<P>It would be a mo&s;t ridiculous thing for a Man here to be &s;een without a Tallow Cap. But Boys are not &s;uffered to wear any, till they come to Maturity; and then they begin to build upon their Heads. The Women have only &s;hort Petti|coats which reach from the Wa&s;te to the Knee. When it Rains they cover their Bodies with a &s;imple Cows-hide, thrown over their Shoulders like a Blanket.</P>
<P>The common Sub&s;i&s;tence of the&s;e People is Bread made of <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn, Beef, Fi&s;h, Milk, Ducks, Hens, Eggs, &amp;c. They al&s;o drink Milk often to quench their Thir&s;t: and this &s;ome|times when it is &s;weet, but commonly they let it be &s;ower fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Milk, which is the common Drink, they make a bet|ter &s;ort of the &s;ame Grain before mentioned, purpo&s;ely to be merry with. And when they meet on &s;uch occa&s;ions, the Men make them&s;elves extraordinary fine, with Feathers &s;tuck into their Caps very thick. They make u&s;e of the long Feathers of Cocks Tails, and none el&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Head Ornaments they wear a piece of Cow|hide, made like a Tail, and 'tis fa&s;tened behind them as a Tail, reaching from their Wa&s;te to the Ground. This piece of Hide is about &s;ix Inches broad, and each &s;ide of it is adorned with little Iron Rings of their own making.</P>
<P>When they are thus attired, their Heads a little intoxicated and the Mu&s;ick playing they'll skip about merrily, and &s;hake their Tails to &s;ome purpo&s;e; but are very innocent in their Mirth.</P>
<P>Every Man may have as many Wives as he can purcha&s;e and maintain: And without buying here are none to be had; neither is there any other Commodity to be bought or &s;old but Women.</P>
<P>Young Virgins are di&s;po&s;ed of by their Fathers, Brothers, or neare&s;t Male Relations. The price is according to the Beau|ty of the Dam&s;el.</P>
<P>They have no Money in this Country, but give Cows in exchange for Wives: And therefore he is the riche&s;t Man that has mo&s;t Daughters or Si&s;ters; for to be &s;ure he will get Cattle enough.</P>
