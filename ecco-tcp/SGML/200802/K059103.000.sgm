<HEAD>THE MERCER: OR Fatal Extravagance,</HEAD>
<P>_OF all the Follies and Vices incidental to mankind, none can be deem'd more Contemptively Erroneous, than that of Living beyond our Fortunes, and running into expen&s;ive Dignities, &s;uperior to the Sphere of Life, in which Providence has placed us. The World has been, and daily continue to be convinced of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, yet &s;o prevalant is this Folly, (I may call it even a Crime,) that either thro' weakne&s;s of Judgement, or ill placed Am|bition,
<PB N="4" REF="3">
very near three parts of the World are guilty of it to their own Prejudice, and tho&s;e whom they are concern'd with.</P>
<P>The following Sheets, contain a genuine Account of an unhappy in&s;tance of this kind, and it's fatal con&s;equences, which give me leave to hope may happily prevent any fu|ture Ills of this Nature. And tho' Hi&s;tories are &s;o commonly made the Entertainment of the Publick, that Truth and Fal&s;ehood are equally regarded, and pa&s;t by, by the Reader only as Fabulous, but this Narrative, has a Claim to Reflection, as it Unfortunately happen'd in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t,, and was the ruin of two worthy Fa|milies, who&s;e Branches are &s;till in being; one of whom gave me a &s;ufficient Account as give them by Tradition, and are now notwith&s;tanding the length of Time &s;ince the dreadful event, unhappy Sufferers, thro' the Indi&s;cretion of their Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>In the foremention'd Reign there was a Gentleman who&s;e name was <HI>We&s;ton,</HI> a wor|thy Per&s;on of a large E&s;tate near the Ci|ty of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who had been Father of many Children, but it plea&s;ed Heaven to
<PB N="5" REF="4">
deprive him of all, except one Daughter his la&s;t born, on whom he be&s;tow'd all that a fond Fater could, to make her a perfectly Accompli&s;h'd young Lady: As &s;he was heire&s;s to a very con&s;iderable E&s;tate, Mr. <HI>We&s;ton</HI> was re&s;olv'd to Qualify her in &s;uch a manner, as to double the value of her For|tune, by in&s;tilling into her Mind, &s;uch Prin|ciples as would not only &s;ecure her own Happine&s;s, but that of the Per&s;on who &s;hould be de&s;tin'd her Partner for Life.</P>
<P>Her beauty, Merit and Fortune, from fif|teen Years of Age, a&s;&s;embled a numerous train of Admirers, but as her heart was not affected by any of them 'till &s;he was above &s;eventeen, her Father would not in&s;i&s;t on a Union with any, 'till &s;he had met with the Man &s;he thought &s;he could be truly happy with; rather preferring his Daughter's Peace of Mind than her intere&s;t, as he could make a worthy Husband entirely ea&s;y in point of Circum&s;tances, whom gratitude as well as Love, wou'd he conceiv'd, compel him to u&s;e his Child well not only by the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a blooming Amiable Creature, but receiv|ing an Advantage of Fortune, the want of which, has too often made way for a Fool, while a Man of Sen&s;e, has been deprived of
<PB N="6" REF="5">
an Opportunity of tenderly making amends for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Deficiency.</P>

<PB N="7" REF="6">
for her agreeable Friend: This did not long remain a Secret in the Family, for Mi&s;s <HI>Den|nis</HI> immediately inform'd her Pappa, who communicated the Affair to Mr <HI>We&s;ton,</HI> and in &s;hort with all due regard to the mode&s;t Fears of the Enamour'd young Lady, the old Gentleman contriv'd very &s;peedily to Crown the happy Lover's wi&s;hes, by a Publick So|lemnization of their Nuptials at <HI>Canterbury</HI> Cathedral.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after, Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> Set up his Son in a Silk Mercer's Shop, giving him a Fortune of four thou&s;and Pounds, in ready Ca&s;h, be&s;ides Two thou&s;and more in Stock.</P>
<P>Tho' this was a genteel Fortune, 'twas un|equal to the young Lady's; who&s;e Father gave her on the Day of Marriage, ten Thou|&s;and Pounds in Bank Notes, and at his Death left her ten Thou&s;and more.</P>
<P>In a few Weeks after the young couple were married, they open'd a very Grand Shop in the City, and Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> placed with his Son as his Foreman one Mr. <HI>Arnold</HI> an elderly di&s;creet Man, who had &s;erv'd in that
<PB REF="7">
Capacity with young <HI>Dennis</HI>'s ma&s;ter, who having acquired a Competent Fortune, left off Trade and retir'd into the Country.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Arnold</HI> was a worthy Man, who having a very large Family, and meeting with mis|fortunes in Trade, was in his early Days &s;o &s;o unhappily reduc'd, as to be oblig'd to throw up his Bu&s;ine&s;s, that without Scandal or reproach he might do Ju&s;tice to his Credi|tors, tho' he him&s;elf &s;uffered greatly, from many to whom he had largely intru&s;ted his Goods, for very con&s;iderable &s;ums.</P>
<P>But as he was a Man of almo&s;t unprece|dented Principles of honour, he rather cho&s;e to lead a life of &s;ervitude, than meanly buffet with ill fortune, to &s;upport at be&s;t a broken Reputation.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Dennis</HI> receiv'd his in&s;tructions in Trade from Mr. <HI>Arnold,</HI> who tutor'd him in &s;o gentle a Manner, it occa&s;ion'd a great Regard and Tenderne&s;s on both &s;ides, and gave the good Man &s;uch a power over <HI>Dennis</HI> that he &s;trictly adher'd to what he advi&s;ed or propo&s;ed, and thought him&s;elf under a cer|tain
<PB N="9" REF="8">
obligation to pay him the Re&s;pect due to Father, and was as fearful of Offending the Friend&s;hip of the one as of di&s;obeying the Commands of the other.</P>
<P>But Ala&s;s Time which brings forth all &s;trange and unaccountable things, wrought a fatal change in the di&s;po&s;ition of this thought|le&s;s young man, who in&s;tead of following the worthy examples of his indu&s;trious friend, &s;oon after his kind father had &s;ettled him in &s;uch a manner, as enabled him in a few years to acquire an immen&s;e fortune; he grew tired of bu&s;ine&s;s, and too fond of every plea&s;urable expence that could po&s;&s;ibly Con&s;pire to effect his ruin, and de&s;troy his fame; the fir&s;t &s;tep towards his de&s;truction was to &s;et up an equi|page, and furni&s;h both his town and country hou&s;e &s;uitable to the dignity of a man of qua|lity; as the family increa&s;ed as it did every year by the birth of a child, additional &s;er|vants were provided, and every needful ex|pence was &s;well'd into a &s;uperfluity.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of the follies he run into the encouragement of a &s;et of hangers on, who made him their daily bread, was not the lea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
And the only virtue that remained untaint|ed in him, was a tender fondne&s;s for his wife and children, which indeed each had an un|doubted claim to; the former for her uncom|mon merit in regard to her husband, and the World in general, the other from their inof|fended innocence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Arnold</HI> perceiving his ma&s;ter's growing ruin, took upon him to u&s;e the Priveledge of friend&s;hip, to warn of the dreadful con&s;e|quences of per&s;i&s;ting in a continuation of this cour&s;e of life, but he had the mortification to find him cold and unwilling to hear or regard the tender admonitions he frequently made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>At la&s;t Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> who was ready dre&s;s'd for a journey to his country hou&s;e one morn|ing, rang the bell, at which &s;ummons a youth who was a turn-over Apprentice to him in&s;tantly appeared and receiv'd an order from his ma&s;ter for Mr. <HI>Arnold</HI> to &s;end him up a bill or ca&s;h, for fifty pounds, in&s;tead of the money Mr. <HI>Arnold</HI> &s;ent his re&s;pects, and that he would wait upon him him&s;elf in a few momets, which accordingly he did, carrying
<PB N="11" REF="10">
with him his book of accompts, in&s;tead of an|&s;wering the demand made by the apprentice. When Mr. <HI>Arnold</HI> enter'd the room, Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> perceiv'd the marks of real &s;orrow in his countenance, which &s;hock'd him, but he &s;till endeavour'd to hide it from the other, and demanded the money, upon which Mr. <HI>Ar|nold</HI> look'd at him very &s;tedfa&s;tly, fetch'd a deep figh, de&s;ir'd him to look over tho&s;e ac|compts and judge how much rea&s;on he had to &s;uppo&s;e, that 'twas po&s;&s;ible for him to ex|pect &s;uch a draught to be an&s;wer'd, and after &s;hewing him the accounts which he knew he would him&s;elf in&s;pect, he &s;at down by him, and with an almo&s;t broken heart, in&s;i&s;ting on his knowing the &s;hameful mi&s;ery he had redu|ced him&s;elf too, and thus addre&s;s'd him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Tis now Sir, the &s;eventh year of your marriage, Six of which you have cruelly &s;pent in the Perpretation of your ruin; your wife's fortune and your own, with your &s;tock in trade inclu&s;ive, is lavi&s;hly wa&s;ted in Extrava|gances, far beyond your right to run into had you been po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of double the &s;um; and give me leave to add, that the figure you have
<PB N="12" REF="11">
made in life, has given &s;uch offence to peo|ple of &s;uperior fortunes, it has lo&s;t you three parts of your cu&s;tomers; and farther let me inform you &s;ir, tho&s;e Per&s;ons who can afford to lay out large &s;ums in your &s;hop, will na|turally think it a high piece of pre&s;umption in you, to put your&s;elf upon a footing with them, who are kind enough to lay out that with you for a &s;upport, which you ba&s;ely and luxuriou&s;ly wa&s;te in needle&s;s and unwarrant|able plea&s;ures, and unnece&s;&s;ary grandeur; 'tis true Sir, the character of a Gentleman can never be degraded by being a worthy trade&s;|man, but then the trade&s;man has no right to run into tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es which even a man of Quality mu&s;t blu&s;h at if he exceeds the limi|tation of his fortune: Pardon me Sir, for this painful friendly liberty, but the concern I feel for your&s;elf and family, enforces me to tell you in the plaine&s;t terms, you are ab&s;o|lutely undone.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> was too &s;en&s;ible of the means he had u&s;ed to prove the truth of his friend's a&s;&s;ertion, and con&s;ervently remained &s;ilent for &s;ome time, at la&s;t con&s;cious of his error, he
<PB N="13" REF="12">
broke through his confu&s;ion, intreating Mr. <HI>Arnold</HI> to conceal the dreadful &s;ituation of his affairs from Mrs <HI>Dennis,</HI> who was entirely innocent and ignorant of them: The fortune (&s;aid he) which &s;he brought me obliged me in honour to regard it as a more than &s;uffici|ent competence to &s;upport her without expo|&s;ing her to the care and fatigue of my bu&s;ine&s;s and tho' I have thro' a mi&s;taken pride, and ridiculous ambition, to &s;et my&s;elf above my|&s;elf, undone my family, &s;he poor &s;oul, never was the lea&s;t incentive to the ruin in which I have incon&s;iderately involv'd my&s;elf: What &s;hall I do? the coach now waits at the door to carry her with my S&s;ter to <HI>Woodford</HI> where we propo&s;e to remain 'till after Chri&s;tmas, but the concern I ju&s;tly labour under renders me incapable of pur&s;uing my intent, or ma|king any rea&s;onable excu&s;e to her for not go|ing with her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Arnold,</HI> overjoy'd to find he had wrought &s;uch an effect on his mind, promi|&s;ed to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavour to &s;often the rigour of his fortune, and find an excu&s;e to Mrs, <HI>Dennis,</HI> that &s;hould appear &s;o plau&s;ible &s;he &s;hould go to her country hou&s;e without her
<PB N="14" REF="13">
Spou&s;e or the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the cau&s;e that detain'd him.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce told his ma&s;ter his de&s;ign, than Mrs. <HI>Dennis</HI> enter'd the room, and with her u&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s of temper, fondly &s;miling on her husband, tenderly accu&s;ed him of delay; informing him the coach had wait|ed a con&s;iderable time and the little Pratlers waited with impatience for Papa to mount and &s;et forward to <HI>Woodford.</HI></P>
<P>Mr <HI>Arnold</HI> who was ever a &s;incere and valuable friend, to prevent his friend's confu|&s;ion, directly told her, he was fearful his ma|&s;ter mu&s;t follow her, for he had receiv'd a let|ter to inform him Mr. <HI>Edgeworth</HI> who was a Merchant, and betroth'd to Mi&s;s <HI>Dennis,</HI> was arriv'd from the <HI>Indies,</HI> at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and lay there dangerou&s;ly ill, and intreated Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> to come forthwith, to &s;ettle &s;ome affairs between them, in regard to him&s;elf and his Si&s;ter, but intreated a concealment of the danger he was in to Mi&s;s <HI>Dennis,</HI> (whom he lov'd more than life) till either Death or a Recovery &s;hould make it nece&s;&s;ary for her to know it</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
Mrs. <HI>Dennis,</HI> ea&s;ily credited the report, and te&s;tified a &s;incere concern for the news, faith|fully promi&s;ing to keep the &s;ecret from her Si&s;ter, and earne&s;tly injoining her Husband to follow her with the utmo&s;t Expedition.</P>
<P>He led her to the Coach, and took leave, when &s;he was gone, Mr. <HI>Arnold</HI> a&s;&s;ured him, 'twas highly proper for him to ab&s;cond, plain|ly proving to him, his per&s;on was in danger if he remain'd at home a day longer: adding that he had from time to time put off his Creditors, partly with di&s;tributing money, and partly by fair promi&s;es, but that the de|mands were &s;o great, the ca&s;h was exhau&s;ted and their patience tired out; therefore Sir, (&s;aid he) let me advi&s;e you, as your hor&s;es are now ready, leave the Servants at home who were ready to attend you, and take Mr. William with you (meaning the Apprentice) you know he is an hone&s;t youth, and loves you too well to betray any tru&s;t you repo&s;e in him; and tho' I have endeavour'd to conceal your unhappy mi&s;management from him as much as po&s;&s;ible, yet his con&s;tant a&s;&s;iduity in his bu&s;ine&s;s, has laid open to him as much as painfully convinces him, that all is not right
<PB N="16" REF="15">
tho' he mode&s;tly conceals by even the mo&s;t di&s;tant hints even to me, that he knows any thing of the matter, but his grateful heart, hourly obliges him to remember your kindly preventing him from being turn'd over to Mr. <HI>O&s;wald,</HI> who would have made his life hate|ful to him, as to his other apprentices; and thinks he can never &s;ufficiently repay the o|bligation you confer'd on him, by your kind acceptation of him, to &s;erve the remaining part of his time with you.</P>
<P>Now Sir, added Mr. <HI>Arnold,</HI> wherever you plea&s;e to go, or whatever you think proper to tran&s;act, you may &s;afely tru&s;t him with, and i'm certain he will with the utmo&s;t fide|lity communicate it to me, who will make it my immediate bu&s;ien&s;s, to &s;ummon all your Creditors and if po&s;&s;ible gain time enough by prudent conduct to retrieve all yet.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> thankfully received Mr. <HI>Ar|nold</HI>'s friendly advice, and &s;et out with his young apprentice undetermin'd what cour&s;e to &s;teer, but in the end, he happen'd to &s;top at a lone genteel Inn, upon <HI>Blackheath,</HI> where after they had refre&s;h'd them&s;elves, as it was
<PB N="17" REF="16">
near town for-expedition's &s;ake, Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> concluded to make that hou&s;e his repo&s;itory, till he heard what progre&s;s Mr. <HI>Arnold</HI> had made in his affairs in London; accordingly William was di&s;patch'd home to inform Mr. <HI>Arnold</HI> where his ma&s;ter re&s;ided, and conti|nued for three days before he heard from his faithful friend, who made the be&s;t u&s;e of his time, to bring the creditors to a Compo&s;ition but in vain; the extravagant cour&s;e of Life Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> had led, and bearing him&s;elf with a lo&s;ty pride. by &s;carcely bargaining but referring it to Servants, had &s;o exa&s;pera|ted them, they were re&s;olved to put the Law in force again&s;t him to the utmo&s;t extremity; and accordingly one morning the Shop had not been open above half an hour, before there enter'd an execution again&s;t Body and Goods.</P>
<P>All that Mr. <HI>Arnold</HI> could do in this ex|tremity was to &s;end poor afflicted William, with the following Letter.</P>
<LETTER>

<P>Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> for &s;ome few moments re|main'd unable to expre&s;s his grief but by his looks, and the poor faithful Boy, who brought the unwelcome News, was equally incapable of uttering his concern; till a flood of tears the dictates of his hone&s;t heart i&s;&s;ued from his eyes, and tenderly convinc'd Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> of the angui&s;h of Soul, the generous Youth en|dur'd for the wreck'd fortune of his unhappy ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>In this Intervel of time, Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> had &s;ent word to his Daughter, that he &s;hould pay her a vi&s;it, and bring with him a per|&s;on, whom he &s;aid wou'd be no unwelcome Gue&s;t to the Family in General, but not mentioning who it was, they could not con|ceive who it &s;hould be, however at the time appointed, Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> arrived at <HI>Woodford,</HI> accompanied by his worthy Friend Mr. <HI>Edgeworth,</HI> who naturally on his arrival paid his fir&s;t compliments to his intended Father in Law, who inform'd, him his be|loved <HI>Harriet</HI> was gone to his Brothers Country Hou&s;e to pa&s;s the Chri&s;tmas there, and that if his impatient De&s;ire to &s;ee his betroth'd, Spou&s;e could hold out till the day following, he would with plea&s;ure attend him thither: Mr. <HI>Edgeworth</HI> was oblig'd in Complai&s;ance to Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> to wait a few Hours, which the fond Imagination of &s;eperated Lovers lengthen into Ages: How|ever, away they went next Morning, and

</LETTER>
<P>On Peru&s;al of the Letter, Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> was &s;truck into a&s;toni&s;hment, and could not re&s;olve within him&s;elf what An&s;wer he &s;hould make to his Landlord's advice in order to repair his fortune, for notwith&s;tanding he had run thro' various Indi&s;cretions; he could not ea&s;ily be &s;ubborned to part with his Hone&s;ty, and purcha&s;e Wealth at the ex|pence of Fame; or the hazard of an Igno|minious Death; He was too &s;en&s;ible of the Sorrows he had drawn upon him&s;elf and Family, without heaping more wretched|ne&s;s upon them by an everduring Infamy, therefore re&s;olved not to li&s;ten to &s;uch a
<PB N="25" REF="24">
flagrant piece of advice, &s;o called for the Landlord and thanked him for his concern, a&s;&s;uring him the Secret &s;hould be for ever bu|ried in his Bo&s;om, but de&s;ired him never more to urge the Subject, and that he would not be thought guilty of compounding with Fe|lony; in&s;i&s;ted on returning the Notes, which the Landlord begged he would not, but the other in&s;i&s;ted upon it, upon which the Land|lord as &s;treniou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted that he would make his Hou&s;e his own, and as freely Command all that was in it; Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> thankfully in|formed him that he was obliged to him for his offer, but that he was under no nece&s;&s;ity at that time to accept on it; while they were conver&s;ing poor <HI>William</HI> arrived with the &s;e|cond &s;hocking Account, that the Creditors had &s;ent their emi&s;&s;aries to <HI>Woodford,</HI> and that they had even taken the Watch from Mrs. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s &s;ide, &s;o the &s;ad Cata&s;trophe was no longer a Secret to the whole Family.</P>
<P>Old Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> was &s;o violently exa&s;pera|ted, he refu&s;ed the lea&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance towards his Son's Redemption, yet pitied his unhappy Daughter in Law, and behaved very tender towards her and her Children as a fond Fa|ther

po&s;&s;ibly could, intreating her to go home with him and &s;trongly urged her though 'twas his own Child to endeavour to forget him; but her fondne&s;s was too powerful to li&s;ten to his Advice, which in the mood the old Gentleman was in, he order'd his Coach and went away highly di&s;plea&s;ed at his Daughter's refu&s;al of his offer, Mr. <HI>Edgeworth,</HI> who had a &s;incere regard for young <HI>Dennis,</HI> which was greatly &s;trengthened by the inviolate fondne&s;s he had for his Si&s;ter, kindly and generou&s;ly re&s;olved to repair his Fortune, by bringing his Creditors to a Compo&s;ition, or if that fail|ed he re&s;olved to pay his Debts, and give him a Term of Years to make him an Acknow|ledgment.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Harriet</HI> took this as the highe&s;t proof of his Regard to her, tho' &s;he was &s;orty he &s;hould hazard any part of his Fortune to &s;erve her Relation, and that &s;he wanted no &s;uch &s;evere proofs of his Pa&s;&s;ion for her, for &s;uch &s;he term'd it, as it was doubtful whether it would ever be in her Brother's power to make him a &s;uitable return; but the&s;e fears did not prevent his generous de&s;ign, which he put in|to immediate Execution the moment he got
<PB N="27" REF="26">
to Town, and with Mr. <HI>Arnold</HI>'s a&s;&s;i&s;tance, every Creditor was paid to the full extent, the amount of which came to upwards of Fourteen Thou&s;and Pounds.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> upon receiving the News of <HI>Wood&s;tock</HI> being &s;urrounded with his Credit|ors, he grew de&s;perate and madly and re&s;ol|ved to take the Advice of his Landlord, who directly furni&s;hed him with Arms and a Hor&s;e that had been trained up to that Bu&s;ine&s;s, and having di&s;patched <HI>William</HI> to Mr. <HI>Arnold,</HI> he &s;et out and was not heard of for two or three Days, in which time, Mrs. <HI>Dennis,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edge|worth,</HI> Mr. <HI>Arnold,</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Harriet,</HI> went down to bring him, but to their great mor|tification he was gone before their Arrival, which di&s;tracted his poor Wife, who had plu|med her&s;elf up with the hopes of being re|&s;tored to her much lov'd Husband, the Land|lord told them it was po&s;&s;ible he might return in a Day or two, befori which he did not ex|pect him, but where he was gone he was en|tirely Ignorant.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Edgeworth</HI> prevailed on Mrs. <HI>Dennis,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> go to Town again, faithfully promi&s;&s;ing
<PB N="28" REF="27">
her to go every Day in &s;earch till he found him, which he did, and in about four Days time Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> return'd to his Landlord's a|gain, and having met with great &s;ucce&s;s in his new fatal Expedition, he &s;et out towards <HI>London,</HI> and met a Gentleman on the Road within two miles of his Lodging, and without any he&s;itation clap'd on his Mask, and bid him Deliver, which the Gentleman refu&s;ing, he immediately &s;hot him thro' the Head, and robbed him of a con&s;iderable Booty, among which was a Letter Ca&s;e all which he rode ha&s;tily off with, leaving the Deceas'd welter|ing in his Blood upon the Road; the Body was &s;oon found and carried into the fir&s;t hou&s;e to be owned, and the Hor&s;e who &s;tood by his dead Ma&s;ter, was al&s;o convey'd thither.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> got to the Inn where he had lodged from the time he went from his own hou&s;e, he directly &s;at down to count <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Booty, which in Ca&s;h was upwards of Twenty Guineas, but on peru&s;ing the Let|ter Ca&s;e, and finding in it Receipts for his own Debts, pay'd by his worthy friend and intended Brother in Law, his Di&s;traction con|&s;equently aro&s;e by an inexpre&s;&s;ible height&punc;
<PB N="29" REF="28">
there was no more room left for deliberate Reflection in &s;o de&s;perate a Ca&s;e, and Mad|ne&s;s raging, he directly &s;nap'd a Pi&s;tol at his head, which mi&s;s'd Fire, and the Landlord coming that In&s;tant into the Room, he was prevented making a &s;econd attempt, but within an hour was taken by &s;ome of the Peo|ple, who were &s;ent out in &s;earch of the Mur|derer, and the hou&s;e which he was in, being greatly &s;u&s;pected to be a Receptacle for high|waymen, that was the fir&s;t they routed; nor had they much trouble in que&s;t of their Man, for he directly own'd the Robery and Murder quietly &s;urrendering him&s;elf to the rigour of the Law, the Penalties of which he thought too little for his Crime.</P>
<P>As he had attempted his Life, proper care was taken to prevent his de&s;troying him&s;elf, and as &s;oon as he was committed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> a &s;ufficient Guard was &s;et over him on that Account.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Harriet</HI> was directly &s;eized with a violent Fever for the lo&s;s of an honourable Lover, barbarou&s;ly depriv'd of Life by the hand of her unhappy Brother, who&s;e &s;hame|ful

End anticipitated the Decrees of Heaven in regard to both, and in a few days gave a fatal Period to that young Lady, who ex|pir'd in the height of Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Denais</HI> had not &s;o happy a Relief, for &s;he lingered in Angui&s;h and De&s;pair, till the Morning her haple&s;s Spou&s;e was to be execu|ted, during who&s;e Confinement &s;he con&s;tant|ly attended him, contrary to the Commands of his and her own Father, who took the Children down into the Country, that they might not be pointed at as the unhappy Of|&s;prings of their unfortunate Father; what ad|ded to the immoderate Grief of this Incon&s;o|lable Creature, was the knowledge of her Husband being Coddemned to be hung in Chains on Account of the Murder.</P>
<P>The Night before his Execution &s;he per|&s;i&s;ted in &s;taying in the <HI>Pre&s;s-Yard,</HI> on the out&s;ide of the Cell, where her de&s;tin'd Hu&s;|band lay; as &s;oon as he was brought forth in the Morning in order to receive his Fate, with &s;peechle&s;s Grief &s;he fell into his Arms, with the tendere&s;t Marks of deep and &s;ilent Sor|row;

in this conflict of De&s;pair and Love, expired.</P>
<P>This &s;hocking &s;cene drew Tears from each Spectator, and &s;ent the Dying Husband quite delirious to his &s;hameful End. Mr. <HI>Arnold,</HI> who at his reque&s;t attended his la&s;t Moments, &s;oon after died with Grief: And poor Mr. <HI>William</HI> the Apprentice who had many Obli|gations to Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> grew into a &s;ettled Melancholly which he never overcame, the Parents of this unhappy Couple lived but few Years after this dreadful Cata&s;trophe, one re|tire from Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the other langui&s;h'd out a mi&s;erable Life at his country &s;eat, where he denied him&s;elf the benefit of Light, from the fatal Hour of his Daughters Death.</P>
<P>This Story is too True to be di&s;tru&s;ted, or Di&s;regarded by the Reader, or tho&s;e who may hear it told; and as every Per&s;on who breaths may be liable to the &s;ame dreadful Misfortune; 'tis not to be deem'd an Offence to relate the &s;ad con&s;equences ari&s;ing from Ill-plac'd pride, and unrea&s;onable Ambition.
