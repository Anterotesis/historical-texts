<HEAD>THE CASE OF Mrs. <HI>CLIVE</HI> Submitted to the PUBLICK.</HEAD>
<P>_IN order to put an End to &s;ome fal&s;e Reports, which have been rai&s;ed in Relation to my not acting this Sea|&s;on, as well as to be&s;peak the Favour of the Publick, I have, by the Ad|vice of my Friends, ventured to ad|dre&s;s my &s;elf to them, from whom I have received many and great Marks
<PB N="6" REF="4">
of Favour, and who&s;e further Protec|tion I now &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>I know Appeals of this Nature, which relate to Di&s;putes that happen at a Theatre, are by &s;ome thought pre&s;uming and impertinent, &s;uppo|&s;ing they are too trifling to demand Attention: But, as I per&s;uade my &s;elf, that Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion are by no means thought Matters of Indif|ference by any who have Humanity, I hope I &s;hall not be thought to take too great a Liberty. I am the more encouraged to hope this from Expe|rience; it having been ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e Performers, who have had the Happine&s;s to plea&s;e on the Stage, and who never did any thing to offend the Publick, whenever they have been injured by tho&s;e who pre&s;ided over Theatres, have &s;eldom, if ever, fail|ed of Redre&s;s upon repre&s;enting the Hard&s;hips they met with: And, as I at this time, apprehend my &s;elf
<PB N="7" REF="5">
to be greatly oppre&s;&s;ed by the Ma|nagers of both Theatres, I hope I &s;hall be ju&s;tified in taking this Method of acquainting the Publick with my Ca&s;e, &s;ubmitting it to their Determi|nation.</P>
<P>Before the Di&s;putes happened be|twixt the Manager of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Theatre and his Actors, I had articled for Five Years to receive Three Hun|dred Pounds a Year, tho' another Performer on that Stage received for Seven Years Five Hundred Guineas, <HI>per</HI> Year; and at the Expiration of my Agreements the Manager offered me an additional Salary to continue at that Theatre.</P>
<P>And &s;ince I have mentioned tho&s;e Di&s;putes, which ended &s;o greatly to the Di&s;advantage of the Actors, I mu&s;t beg Leave to endeavour to &s;et that Matter in a clear Light, which hitherto has been mi&s;repre&s;ented to the Publick: I think my &s;elf obliged
<PB N="8" REF="6">
to this, as the Hard&s;hips I at pre&s;ent labour under are owing to that Di&s;|agreement; if any think I treat this Matter too &s;eriou&s;ly, I hope they will remember, that however trifling &s;uch Things may appear to them, to me, who am &s;o much concerned in 'em, they are of great Importance, &s;uch as my Liberty and Livelihood de|pend on.</P>
<P>As only two Theatres were autho|ri&s;ed, the Managers thought it was in their Power to reduce the Incomes of tho&s;e Performers, who could not live independant of their Profe&s;&s;ion; but in order to make this appear with a better Face to the Town, it was agreed to complain of the Actors Salaries being too great, and accord|ingly a fal&s;e Account was publi&s;hed of them in the daily Papers, by whom I will not &s;ay: Whether, or no, &s;ome particular Salaries were &s;o, I will not pretend to determine; yet, in the whole,
<PB N="9" REF="7">
they did not amount to more than had been allowed for many Years, when the Theatre was under a frugal and exact Regulation; when the Ma|nagers punctually fulfilled, not only all Engagements to their Actors, but to every other Per&s;on concerned in the Theatre, and rai&s;ed very con&s;iderable Fortunes for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing the Expence of the Theatre too high, I am very certain it was not the Actors refu&s;ing to &s;ub|mit to a proper Reduction of them, which made &s;o many of them quit the Stage, but from great Hard&s;hips they underwent, and greater which they feared would happen from an Agree|ment &s;uppo&s;ed to be concluded be|twixt the two Managers, which made 'em apprehend, that if they &s;ubmitted to act under &s;uch Agreements, they mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely in the Managers Power; and the Event has proved
<PB N="10" REF="8">
that their Fears were not ill-grounded, as I doubt not but I &s;hall make ap|pear.</P>
<P>When the Actors Affairs obliged 'em to return to the Theatres la&s;t Winter, under &s;uch Abatements of their Salaries as hardly afforded the greater Part of them a Sub&s;i&s;tence, I was offered, by the Manager of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Theatre, &s;uch Terms as bore no Proportion to what he gave other Performers, or to tho&s;e he had offered me at the beginning of the Sea&s;on. They were &s;uch as I was advis'd not to accept, becau&s;e it was known they were propo&s;ed for no rea&s;on but to in&s;ult me, and make me &s;eek for better at the other Theatre; for I knew it had been &s;ettled, by &s;ome dark Agreement, that Part of the Ac|tors were to go to <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Theatre, and others to <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>; I did, indeed, apprehend I &s;hould meet
<PB N="11" REF="9">
with better Terms at <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> becau&s;e that Manager had made many Overtures to get me into his Com|pany the preceding Sea&s;on, and many times before: But when I apply'd to him, he offered me exactly the &s;ame which I had refu&s;ed at the other Theatre, and which I likewi&s;e rejected, but was per&s;uaded to accept &s;ome very little better, rather than &s;eem ob&s;tinate in not complying as well as others, and yielded &s;o far to the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Time, as to Act under a much le&s;s Salary than &s;everal other Performers on that Stage, and &s;ubmitted to pay a Sum of Money for my Benefit, notwith&s;tanding I had had one clear of all Expence for Nine Years be|fore; an Advantage the fir&s;t Per|formers had been thought to merit for near Thirty Years, and had grown into a Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="10">When I was fixed at that Theatre I determined to &s;tay there; I did, in all things which related to my Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, &s;ubmit intirely to that Mana|ger's Direction, and, with the help of other principal Performers, did greatly promote his Intere&s;t, as was evident from the Audiences after we went to Act there; but I found, by his Behaviour to me, it was de&s;igned I &s;hould not continue with him, but return the next Sea&s;on to <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI></P>
<P>The Agreements betwixt that Ma|nager and me were verbal, but made before two Gentlemen of Character and Fortune, on whom I mu&s;t de|pend for the fulfilling of them; they were for one Year. At the end of the Acting-&s;ea&s;on the Manager &s;ent an Office-keeper to me with &s;ome Sa|lary that was due, who required a Receipt in full; I told him a very great
<PB N="13" REF="11">
Part of my Agreements were yet due, and reque&s;ted to &s;ee the Manager, who came and acknowledged them, and promi&s;ed to bring one of the Gentlemen who was pre&s;ent at our Ingagements in a Day or two and pay me, and then he &s;aid he had done with me; but he has not paid me, nor have I ever &s;een him &s;ince, or as much as heard from him.</P>
<P>It has always been a Cu&s;tom in Theatres, that if ever any Actor or Actre&s;s was to be di&s;charged, or their Allowance le&s;&s;en'd, they were acquain|ted with it at the End of the Sea&s;on; the Rea&s;on of this will appear to be the giving them a proper Notice to provide for them&s;elves: This the Ma|nager of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> did to all his Company whom he de&s;igned to di&s;|charge, or who&s;e Allowance was to be le&s;&s;en'd, except to me, which made me actually then conclude he deter|mined
<PB N="14" REF="12">
I &s;hould continue with him, 'till I was undeceived by his Play-Bills with the Names of other Actre&s;&s;es in Parts I u&s;ed to perform; &s;o that he has not only broke thro' the Cu&s;toms of the Theatre, but tho&s;e in practice almo&s;t every where, in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing me, and has done me a real Injury in &s;uch an unprecedented Act of In|ju&s;tice; for had I been informed of his De&s;ign at the End of the Sea&s;on, I could have made Terms to have acted in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where I had met with mo&s;t uncommon Civilities, and received very great Advantages, which I &s;hall ever remember with the ut|mo&s;t Gratitude, and take this and every other Opportunity to acknow|ledge.</P>
<P>As I have &s;aid, it has been a Cu|&s;tom to give Actors Notice of a Di&s;charge: I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time ob&s;erve, That it never was a Cu&s;tom
<PB N="15" REF="13">
to di&s;charge any, but upon Neglect of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, or &s;uch as were ob|noxious to the Publick; this Maxim extended even to tho&s;e of the lowe&s;t Cla&s;s; but to tho&s;e, on who&s;e Per|formances the Town had been plea&s;ed to &s;tamp a Value, by their Indul|gence and Applau&s;e, the Stage was always a Support, even after Age or any Accident had made 'em incapa|ble of their Profe&s;&s;ion; for the then Patentees thought it as great a Piece of In&s;olence to deprive the Publick of their Plea&s;ures, as of Cruelty and Inju&s;tice to deny tho&s;e a Sub&s;i&s;tence who had contributed towards 'em; for they knew and acknowledged, that the Publick was the only Sup|port of all, con&s;equently had an in|di&s;putable Right to be plea&s;ed in the be&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It is pretended by the Managers, that they have the &s;ame Right to di&s;|charge
<PB N="16" REF="14">
an Actor that a Ma&s;ter has to turn away a Servant, than which nothing can be more fal&s;e and ab|&s;urd; for, when a Ma&s;ter di&s;mi&s;&s;es a Servant, there are many thou&s;ands be|&s;ides to apply to; but when the Ma|nagers di&s;mi&s;s an Actor, where are they to apply? It is unlawful to act any where but with them; Nece&s;&s;ity or Inclination brings every one to the Stage; if the former happens to be the Ca&s;e, they will not readily find an Employment; and if the latter, they will not be fit for one; &s;o that it will appear an Act of great In|ju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion. If it &s;hould be objected, That the Actors De|mands are &s;o exorbitant, that the Managers cannot comply with 'em? I have already endeavoured to &s;how, that tho' two or three Salaries might be thought &s;o in general, they did not amount to more than had been
<PB N="17" REF="15">
allowed, and very con&s;iderable Profits ari&s;ing to the Patentees. But there is a very melancholy In&s;tance, that the Actors Demands is not the Rea&s;on of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing 'em, but the Will of the Manager alone; &s;ince la&s;t Sea&s;on an Actor and Actre&s;s returned to <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> under &s;uch Abatements as that Manager thought proper, and &s;uch as were in no degree equal to their Merit; and yet, at the begin|ning of this Sea&s;on, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, after having been from their Infancy on the Stage, and having no other Profe&s;&s;ions to live by, and very nu|merous Families to &s;upport.</P>
<P>The Manager of <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> tho' he can't but know I am di&s;engag'd from the other Theatre, has not made any Application to me to act with him, which he has done to &s;everal others who quitted that Stage at the Time I did: The Rea&s;ons which
<PB N="18" REF="16">
obliged me to leave him &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t: He owes me a Hundred and Sixty Pounds, twelve Shillings, which he has acknowledged to be ju&s;tly due, and promi&s;ed Payment of it by la&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> to a Per&s;on of too great Con&s;equence for me to mention here, the greater Part of it Money I ex|pended for Cloaths for his U&s;e. He offer'd me, la&s;t Sea&s;on, not near half as much as he afterwards agreed to give another Performer, and le&s;s than he then gave to &s;ome others in his Company; &s;o that I mu&s;t conclude, as every one knows there are Agree|ments betwixt the Managers, that there is a De&s;ign to di&s;tre&s;s me, and reduce me to &s;uch Terms as I cannot comply with.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry I am reduced to &s;ay any thing in favour of my&s;elf; but, as I think I merit as much as ano|ther Performer, and the Managers are
<PB N="19" REF="17">
&s;o de&s;irous to convince me of the contrary, I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed; e&s;pecially when I declare, that at this time, I am not in the lea&s;t vain of my Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As to my Performances, the Au|dience are the only proper Judges: But I may venture to affirm, That my Labour, and Application, have been greater than any other Perfor|mers on the Stage. I have not only acted in almo&s;t all the Plays, but in Farces and Mu&s;ical Entertainments; and very frequently two Parts in a Night, even to the Prejudice of my Health. I have been at a very great Expence in Ma&s;ters for Singing; for which Article alone, the Managers now give five and &s;ix Pounds a Week. My additional Expences, in belonging to the Theatre, amount to upwards of one Hundred Pounds a Year, in Clothes, and other Nece&s;&s;aries; and
<PB N="20" REF="18">
the pretended great Salaries, of ten and twelve Pounds a Week, which have been &s;o artfully, and fal&s;ly re|pre&s;ented to the Town, to the Pre|judice of the Actors, will, upon En|quiry, appear to be no more than half as much, &s;ince they performed la&s;t Sea&s;on, at the Theatres, very &s;el|dom above three or four Days a Week; &s;o taking in the long Vaca|tion, when there are no Plays at all, to tho&s;e Days the pre&s;ent Managers omit acting, a Salary which appears to be great, will be found, in effect, to be very moderate; and tho&s;e which are le&s;s, not a Sufficiency.</P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed all I propos'd; I have &s;hown in how aggravating a manner, without any Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, and at a Time a very con&s;iderable Sum of Money was owing to me, I have been turn'd out of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Theatre. The Manager of
<PB N="21" REF="19">
<HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> tho' he can't but know what ju&s;t Rea&s;ons I had for quitting him, has never apply'd to me to re|turn, nor made the lea&s;t Excu&s;e for not paying my Arrears, tho' due &s;o long, and after promi&s;ing Payment near a Year, notwith&s;tanding I have, for many Years, not only endeavour'd, but &s;ucceeded, in greatly promoting that Manager's Intere&s;t, as is known to him&s;elf and his whole Company.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of my taking the Liberty to communicate the&s;e Things to the Publick, is mo&s;t earne&s;tly to interceed for their Favour and Protection, from whom I have al|ways met with great Genero&s;ity and Indulgence: For, as I have already declared, in a Letter publi&s;hed by me la&s;t Year in the Daily Papers, that I had not a Fortune to &s;upport me, independent of my Profe&s;&s;ion, I doubt not but it will appear, I have not
<PB N="22" REF="20">
made any con&s;iderable Acqui&s;ition to it &s;ince, having not received two Hundred Pounds Salary for acting in Plays, Farces, and Singing; tho' other Performers have received more than twice that Sum. I have, in Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Hard&s;hips, been promi&s;ed the Protection of many La|dies, to whom I have the Honour to be per&s;onally known, and will not doubt the Concurrence of the Pub|lick, in receiving my Performance in the be&s;t manner I am, at pre&s;ent, ca|pable of, which I &s;hall always mo&s;t gratefully Acknowledge.</P>
