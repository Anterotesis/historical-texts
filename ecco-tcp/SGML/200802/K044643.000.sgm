Let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due Sea&s;on we &s;hall reap if we faint not.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS the chief Purport and De&s;ign of the holy Apo&s;tle, thoughout his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> was to exhort his Fellow-la|bourers in the Vineyard of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to a Continuance in well-doing, to a &s;teady Zeal and Per&s;everance in the great and important Bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;&s;ign'd to their Care; he takes Occa&s;ion, in the Conclu&s;ion of it, to put them in Mind of that grand Point on which their Succe&s;s mu&s;t in a great Mea&s;ure depend; to enforce the Nece&s;&s;ity of a firm and unalterable Re|&s;olution; and at the &s;ame Time to intimate to them the Advantages, which wou'd naturally flow from &s;uch a Conduct.</P>
<P><HI>Let us not,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>be weary in well-doing, for in due Sea&s;on we &s;hall reap if we faint not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who was no Stranger to human Nature and all its Infirmities; who knew how Men are for the mo&s;t Part guided by their Hopes and Fears; who knew how arduous a Ta&s;k they had engaged in; who probably knew al&s;o that they had been per&s;e|cuted and oppre&s;s'd, and were perhaps greatly di&s;|pirited and ca&s;t down; endeavours to comfort, and &s;upport them by a Promi&s;e of better Succe&s;s, and a &s;trong A&s;&s;urance of future Reward; <HI>we &s;hall reap,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>in due Sea&s;on, if we faint not.</HI></P>
<P>As the Mind of Man is ever fluctuating and in|con&s;tant, fond of Novelty and impatient of Con|finement, as good Intents and Di&s;po&s;itions come upon us, as it were, but by Starts and Sallies, and even in the be&s;t of us are &s;eldom of long Duration; no Caution can be more nece&s;&s;ary than that given in the Text, nor any &s;tronger Motive to induce us to a Compliance with it than that which is there annex'd.</P>
<P>It is with great Truth ob&s;erved of all human Plea|&s;ures, that the Satisfaction lies more in the Pur&s;uit than in the Enjoyment of them: The Sport is in the Chace and not the Game; and thus it is in mo&s;t of our Actions. Whil&s;t we have Novelty to delight us, we feel neither Fatigue nor Satiety; but when we have got up the Hill, and view'd the whole Pro&s;pect, our Eyes begin to wander after fre&s;h Ob|jects; De&s;ire grows languid, and &s;omething el&s;e is
<PB N="5" REF="4">
wanting to revive, and &s;et it at Work again. How many noble and excellent De&s;igns, calculated to promote the Welfare of Society, have been thrown a&s;ide merely through Li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and want of Per&s;e|verance! It is much ea&s;ier to begin than to conti|nue in any good and prai&s;e-worthy Undertaking. Nothing doth in Reality &s;o much de&s;troy the Credit of Morality as Indolence, and Wavering; nothing doth &s;o much promote and honour it as Steadine&s;s and Re&s;olution: But I know not how it is, Vice and Folly have gain'd over Indu&s;try to their Party, and all the Endeavours of Rea&s;on and Religion to render Virtue habitual are ineffectual. How &s;oon do Men faint in the Race of true Glory! how in|defatigable are they in the Pur&s;uit of fal&s;e! how &s;eldom weary of doing ill! how languid in Actions of Goodne&s;s or Beneficence! The <HI>Feet of the mali|cious</HI> and revengeful are &s;low to &s;erve the wretched, but <HI>&s;wift to &s;hed Blood:</HI> Evil Doers are re&s;olute, ac|tive, vigilant; while the Followers of Good want perpetual Monitors to awaken, and &s;timulate them. There is always a <HI>Lion in the Path</HI> to ob&s;truct them. Every Ob&s;tacle alarms; every Di&s;appointment checks; every Danger throws them into Doubt, Diffidence, and De&s;pair. How di&s;graceful is it to the Cau&s;e of Truth that the Advocates for Fal&s;ehood &s;hould &s;o far exceed them in Zeal and Alacrity; and that the Re&s;olution and Firmne&s;s, which would
<PB N="6" REF="5">
throw &s;o great a Lu&s;tre on Virtue and Religion, &s;hould be li&s;ted in the Service of Vice and Debau|chery! Shall we never be per&s;uaded to make that, which is our Intere&s;t and Duty, our Plea&s;ure al&s;o and our Happine&s;s? Shall not all tho&s;e, who are already engaged, re&s;olve to continue in well-doing? Let us re&s;t a&s;&s;ured we &s;hall meet with a Recom|pence of Reward; that <HI>we &s;hall</HI> certainly <HI>reap, if we faint not.</HI> Let this then in&s;pire us with fre&s;h Vigour, and re-animate us in the noble Struggle for Victory.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s the be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual Method of carrying on great and laudable Undertakings is by the Union and Cement of Society; by various Lines all tending to one great Center, held together by Charity, the Bond of all Virtues. Nothing can be|&s;tow truer Satisfaction on a benevolent Mind than to reflect on the many pious and u&s;eful De&s;igns, which have of late Years been promoted by collective P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">|dies of Men among&s;t us; and greater things we tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t may yet be done. Few indeed in the&s;e our Day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> are the Wi&s;e and Good; and yet &s;mall and incon|&s;iderable as is their Number, were they once hear|tily to unite in the Cau&s;e of Piety and Virtue, <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace might once more ki&s;s each other,</HI> and the Triumph over Vice and Irreligion be an ea&s;y and a glorious Conque&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
To prepare the Way for this Triumph, we are here on this Day a&s;&s;embled; to exhort one ano|ther in the Continuance of well-doing, to return our hearty and unfeigned Thanks to God for the good Succe&s;s we have already met with, and to call down a Ble&s;&s;ing on our Endeavours; an an|nual Solemnity, e&s;tabli&s;h'd by, and very con&s;onant with, the Piety and Goodne&s;s of Men engaged in &s;o noble and u&s;eful an Undertaking; a Solemnity, which, it were to be wi&s;h'd, might be ob&s;erved by all, who &s;hall at any Time enter into Pur&s;uits of the like Nature.</P>
<P>The Foundation of Colonies is perhaps of all Charities the mo&s;t noble and exten&s;ive, as it pro|motes both public Welfare and private Utility; and whil&s;t it brings Honour and Plenty to the whole Body, &s;ecures at the &s;ame Time the Peace, Safety, and Happine&s;s of the Individual; it is not narrow and circum&s;cribed, but embraces the whole Range of &s;ocial Duties, and takes in our Duty to God, to our Country, and to our Kind.</P>
<P>What the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays of Children, may I think, with great Propriety, be applied to the&s;e E&s;tabli&s;h|ments, <HI>They are like the Arrows in the Hand of the Giant, happy is</HI> that King <HI>who hath his Quiver full of them;</HI> they give Delight to his Friends, and Terror to his Enemies, and &s;erve, like burni&s;h'd
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Armour to the Warrior, both to adorn and to defend.</P>
<P>Such as promote and encourage the&s;e glorious Undertakings, are true <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> far better <HI>Chri&s;|tians,</HI> than all the modern Pretenders to In&s;pira|tion and Apo&s;tle&s;hip, which have &s;prung up among&s;t us. The&s;e Deeds and the&s;e Men will be remem|ber'd, when the Zeal of Fools and the Bigotry of Enthu&s;ia&s;ts &s;hall be forgotten. The&s;e are the true Patriots and Lovers of their Country, who are thus anxious for her Glory, thus active for her In|tere&s;t, <HI>who &s;end forth her Fame unto all Lands, and her Words unto the Ends of the World.</HI></P>
<P>Among&s;t the&s;e <HI>true Chri&s;tians</HI> and true Patriots, the E&s;tabli&s;hers of <HI>Georgia</HI> claim our highe&s;t Ve|neration, E&s;teem, and Gratitude; a Colony, which was for a long Time cheri&s;h'd and encouraged with mo&s;t amazing Warmth and Alacrity; but though the Legi&s;lature doth continue to encourage it by con&s;tant Supplies, and tho' tho&s;e Supplies are fairly and ju&s;tly appropriated by the Tru&s;tees to the U&s;es for which they are granted; yet whether it be that public Charity hath &s;ince emptied it&s;elf into other Channels; whether, as I before ob&s;erved, the Love of Novelty hath diverted it; whether a fal&s;e Notion may have prevailed that it doth not &s;tand in Need of any farther A&s;&s;i&s;tance; to which ever Cau&s;e we mu&s;t attribute it, certain it is, it
<PB N="9" REF="8">
doth not at pre&s;ent &s;o much engro&s;s the public Care and Concern as it once did, or as it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped we are not grown <HI>weary in well|doing.</HI> It has &s;uffered from us and &s;hould be com|forted; it has merited from and &s;hould be re|warded by us.</P>
<P>On it's Trade and Commerce, on it's Ports and Havens, the Wealth and Safety of a Nation, &s;itu|ated as ours is, mu&s;t principally depend. How u&s;eful <HI>Georgia</HI> hath already been in all the&s;e Re|&s;pects, how much more &s;o it may &s;till be render'd, hath already been made &s;ufficiently evident.</P>
<P>Undeniable it is, and mu&s;t be, that every Ar|gument, which hath been at any Time alledged in Favour of this Colony, will at this Time recur to us with double Force, whether we con&s;ider it in a civil or in a religious Light.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the mi&s;erable State of Ser|vitude and Dependence, in which &s;o many among&s;t us are involved; the Penury of &s;ome; the Afflic|tions of others; and at the &s;ame Time call to Mind that there is a Haven of Re&s;t open to them; a Place where they may be a&s;&s;ured of Maintenance and Support, where tho&s;e Talents and Accompli&s;h|ments, which might perhaps here lie undi&s;cover'd, or undi&s;tingui&s;h'd; would be highly valued and e&s;teem'd; when we con&s;ider that it is thus in the Power of Men to exchange Want and Sorrow for
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Ea&s;e and Affluence, Infamy for Reputation, and Slavery for Freedom; is it not Matter of A&s;toni&s;h|ment they &s;hould yet prefer Mi&s;ery to Happine&s;s, and be in love with Ruin, Poverty and De&s;truc|tion? But there are Thou&s;ands among&s;t us, of the low and illiterate e&s;pecially, who had rather beg and &s;tarve here than flouri&s;h any where el&s;e; Wretches, who talk with Fear and Trembling of the Mi&s;ery of quitting Friends and Home, when at the &s;ame Time it may be they have neither Home nor Friends to leave.</P>
<P>Prejudices again&s;t Places, Things, or Per&s;ons, without Rea&s;on or Judgment to countenance them, are among the mo&s;t pernicious Weakne&s;&s;es of our Nature; they &s;hew a fooli&s;h cowardly Diffidence of our&s;elves; a blameable, not to &s;ay an impious di&s;tru&s;t of our Creator, as if his Bounty could not &s;upply our Wants in every Climate, his right Hand guide and defend us in every Situation and Circum&s;tance of Life.</P>
<P>But the Idle, who are here and will not go over, have another Rea&s;on al&s;o, and that is, that the Idle who were there before did not like it; and if the Di&s;&s;olute and Slothful have left the Province, (as many of them have) &s;o much the better; the Idle in a <HI>Colony,</HI> like Cowards in an Army, are but a dead Weight and an Incumbrance; the Bu&s;ine&s;s is much better carried on without
<PB N="11" REF="10">
them. If the Members be rotten and corrupt, it is better they &s;hould be &s;ever'd from the Body, le&s;t they infect and mortify it.</P>
<P>Such as remain there will in all Probability be more indu&s;trious and &s;erviceable; their Fidelity and Per&s;everance &s;tand in a &s;tronger Point of Light; and &s;eem in a more particular Manner to demand your Gratitude towards them.</P>
<P>But let us con&s;ider <HI>Georgia</HI> in a religious Light. Con&s;ider it as a Shelter from the Tyranny of Bigots and Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and as a Door of Knowlege to the unenlighten'd <HI>Barbarian;</HI> as well in Regard to tho&s;e, who fly from a fal&s;e Religion, as tho&s;e who are ignorant of the true. Thanks be to God, we are not per&s;ecuted; we are under no Fear of Axes, Faggots, and an Inqui&s;ition; and all our ea&s;y Ta&s;k is to <HI>love Mercy,</HI> and <HI>walk humbly with our God.</HI> If we do <HI>love Mercy</HI> then, here we may &s;hew it; if we our&s;elves would <HI>walk humbly with our God,</HI> let us give others an Opportunity of doing &s;o too. Per&s;ecution hath already driven many thi|ther, who de&s;erved a better Fate. It is remarked, to the Honour of the <HI>Saltzburghers,</HI> that they live together in the utmo&s;t Harmony and Happine&s;s; an amiable Copy of the fir&s;t Ages of the World; in <HI>godly Love and mutual Charity one towards ano|ther;</HI> in that Simplicity of Life and Manners, &s;o rarely to be met with in any Age, &s;o very &s;eldom
<PB N="12" REF="11">
in our own. This is furely a State which Kings might envy them. They have Rea&s;on to ble&s;s the Hand which per&s;ecuted them, and to look on their Enemies, who drove them to &s;uch an A&s;ylum, as their be&s;t Friends and Benefactors.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall we &s;ay to the great Advantages, which may ari&s;e from &s;preading the Go&s;pel-doc|trine among the neighbouring <HI>Indians?</HI> Can there be an Employment worthier a good Man, an Em|ployment capable of imparting more Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction to a right Mind than that of cultivating and improving the human Soul; to &s;often and re|fine the Manners; to tame, by gentle Methods, the Wildne&s;s of the Savage; and humanize him into a &s;ocial and benevolent Being; to be In&s;tru|ments in the Hands of God of &s;aving many Souls from Death; to be the Means of propagating our holy Religion among tho&s;e, who <HI>have no Know|lege of her Laws,</HI> that we may all become <HI>one Flock under one Shepherd;</HI> this is &s;urely a mo&s;t noble and mo&s;t de&s;irable Employment. To this Purpo&s;e &s;ome are &s;et apart, and to this every one, as far as in him lies, will it is hoped gladly contribute; and if they are rightly taught and in&s;tructed by us, if we <HI>&s;ow unto them &s;piritual Things, we &s;hall reap their tem|poral Things;</HI> they will think no Labour too great, no Toil too irk&s;ome to reward tho&s;e, who have thus open'd their Minds, and brought them from the
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Darkne&s;s of Pagani&s;m and Idolatry to the Know|lege of God, and of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Surely if there were no other Inducement, this would be &s;ufficient to prevent our growing weary. The Indu&s;try of <HI>Rome</HI> in making Pro&s;elytes has long been a Reproach to us; their Warmth and Re&s;olution make our cold Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s &s;till more in|excu&s;able.</P>
<P>It is too common among the Potentates of the Earth to e&s;tabli&s;h Colonies by Force and Vio|lence; to &s;end out Men with Orders to &s;eize on the fir&s;t convenient Spot, and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, after putting to Death all the wretched Inhabitants. This we know has been done; but <HI>Georgia</HI> was not thus e&s;tabli&s;h'd; no Property was invaded, no Blood &s;pilt; we did not ravage or de&s;troy for it; the &s;ame Methods, which were made U&s;e of in the Acqui&s;ition, were al&s;o follow'd, when we were &s;et|tled in it; and it was originally de&s;ign'd that there &s;hould be no &s;uch Thing as Slavery in <HI>Georgia.</HI></P>
<P>To this End, a general Equality was propo&s;ed and acquie&s;ced in, every Man's E&s;tate was limited, and no one &s;uffer'd by Means of exorbitant Power, or greater Extent of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to lord it over, or in&s;ult his Fellow-labourers and Brothers of the Community.</P>
<P>It was not therefore without great Concern that the <HI>Tru&s;tees</HI> found them&s;elves under the Nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="14" REF="13">
of introducing Negro-&s;laves into the <HI>Colony:</HI> but in this Particular, as in all others, they have, at the &s;ame Time, acted with the utmo&s;t Prudence and Humanity. Such Regulations are already made as will greatly tend to promote the Glory of God, and the Good of our Country. Care has been taken to check the In&s;olence of Power, to prevent all &s;evere Treatment, all Acts of Violence or Op|pre&s;&s;ion, that if the&s;e unhappy Beings mu&s;t eat the Bread of Slavery, they &s;hall at lea&s;t eat it in Peace and Quiet, that their Chains may not gall them, that their <HI>Yoke may be ea&s;y, and their Burthen light;</HI> and that <HI>their Ma&s;ters &s;hall,</HI> as St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, <HI>give unto their Servants that which is ju&s;t and equal, knowing that they al&s;o have a Ma&s;ter in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>To treat our Fellow-creatures, tho&s;e who partake of the &s;ame Nature with us, Sons of one common Lord and Father, as Aliens and Illegitimate; to take Advantage of any ca&s;ual Superiority, either of bodily or mental Powers, to triumph over and in&s;ult them; is &s;urely unworthy of us as Men, and a Di&s;grace to us as <HI>Chri&s;tians:</HI> Whil&s;t, on the other Hand, toenlarge and refine their Souls; to call them from a State of Anarchy and Confu&s;ion to Order and Harmony, to the Benefits of mutual Conver&s;e, and all the protected Joys of Society; and above all, to make them Partakers with us of
<PB N="15" REF="14">
the joyful Hope of another and better World: This is an Ambition worthy of us; this has been your Ambition, may it be crowned with Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>The Negroes in <HI>Georgia,</HI> by your late Orders, will be made u&s;eful not dangerous Subjects; Ser|vants, but not Slaves; dependent, but not mi&s;era|ble Beings; and it is hoped, an Example &s;o truly noble and Prai&s;e-worthy, will be followed by the re&s;t of our <HI>Colonies;</HI> that they al&s;o will act with Humanity and Tenderne&s;s to all tho&s;e who are in Subjection under them; that if we call them in to give us their Labour, we &s;hall not grudge them in Return Knowlege and In&s;truction; that if they are forced to live among <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> Care will be taken that they may them&s;elves in Time become &s;o; that if we u&s;e their Bodies for our Support and Happine&s;s, their Souls may be refre&s;hed; and that for their Service here to us, we may be&s;tow on them, by our In&s;tructions, the glorious Oppor|tunity of &s;ecuring to them&s;elves eternal Happine&s;s hereafter.</P>
<P>Let us not <HI>then</HI> be weary in well-doing.</P>
<P>There is doubtle&s;s now more Encouragement for all that are willing and ready to go there, than there ever yet could be: The Way is become &s;mooth and pa&s;&s;able, and every Ob&s;tacle removed, which could alarm the Timid, or terrify the Bold; the Country rendered more healthful, and more fer|tile;
<PB N="16" REF="15">
Friends ready to embrace and a&s;&s;i&s;t all who will vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>Whatever Di&s;appointment the <HI>Colony</HI> may have met with; whatever Di&s;couragements may have prejudiced it; tho&s;e, to who&s;e Care it was commit|ted, are intirely Blamele&s;s: The <HI>honourable Tru&s;tees</HI> have acted always with Integrity and Uprightne&s;s, with the utmo&s;t Care and A&s;&s;iduity, and have done all that Men could to &s;upport and encourage this good Work, and have the Te&s;timony withal of a good Con&s;cience to inform them that in this, as in all other Things, when they have done what <HI>they can,</HI> they have done what <HI>they ought.</HI> But after all, national Undertakings a Nation mu&s;t &s;up|port. To the Public therefore we mu&s;t appeal for Succour if we &s;tand in need of it.</P>
<P>Now that <HI>God,</HI> as the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> &s;ays, <HI>has made Peace within our Borders, and filled us with the Flower of Wheat,</HI> now that <HI>the Plougher plougheth in hope,</HI> now that the Harve&s;t is ready to be ga|thered in, now let the Sun of Beneficence &s;hine forth upon it. We have <HI>&s;owed in Tears</HI> but we &s;hall <HI>reap in Joy.</HI> We have, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>been trou|bled on every &s;ide:</HI> Though perplexed, we need not be in De&s;pair. We have been <HI>per&s;ecuted, but not for&s;aken, ca&s;t down but not de&s;troy'd.</HI></P>
<P>We may &s;ay with the <HI>Children of Dan, we have &s;een the Land, and behold it is very good; be not
