<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following E&s;&s;ays have already appeared at different times, and in different publications. The pamphlets in which they were in&s;erted being generally un&s;ucce&s;sful, the&s;e &s;hared the common fate, without a&s;&s;i&s;ting the book&s;eller's aims, or extending the writer's reputation. The public was too &s;trenuou&s;ly employed with their own fol|lies, to be a&s;&s;iduous in e&s;timating mine; &s;o that many of my be&s;t attempts in this way, have fal|len victims to the tran&s;ient topic of the times; the Gho&s;t in Cock-lane, or the &s;iege of Ticon|derago.</P>
<P>But though they have pa&s;t pretty &s;ilently in the world, I can by no means complain of their circulation. The magazines and papers of the day, have, indeed, been liberal enough in this
<PB N="ii" REF="6">
re&s;pect. Mo&s;t of the&s;e e&s;&s;ays have been regu|larly reprinted twice or thrice a year, and con|veyed to the public through the kennel of &s;ome engaging compilation. If there be a pride in multiplied editions, I have &s;een &s;ome of my la|bours &s;ixteen times reprinted, and claimed by different parents as their own. I have &s;een them flouri&s;hed at the beginning with prai&s;e, and &s;igned at the end with the names of Philantos, Philalethes, Philaleutheros, and Philanthropos. The&s;e gentlemen have kindly &s;tood &s;pon&s;ors to my productions, and to flatter me more, have al|ways pa&s;t them as their own.</P>
<P>It is time, however, at la&s;t, to vindicate my claims; and as the&s;e entertainers of the public, as they call them&s;elves, have partly lived upon me for &s;ome years, let me now now try if I can|not live a little upon my&s;elf. I would de&s;ire in this ca&s;e, to imitate that fat man whom I have &s;omewhere heard of in a &s;hipwreck, who, when the &s;ailors pre&s;t by famine, were taking &s;lices from his po&s;teriors, to &s;atisfy their hunger, in|&s;i&s;ted with great ju&s;tice on having the fir&s;t cut for him&s;elf,</P>
<P>Yet after all, I cannot be angry with any who have taken it into their heads, to think that what|ever I write is worth reprinting, particularly when I con&s;ider how great a majority will think it &s;carce worth reading. Trifling and &s;uperficial are terms of reproach that are ea&s;ily objected, and
<PB N="iii" REF="7">
that carry an air of penetration in the ob&s;erver. The&s;e faults have been objected to the following e&s;&s;ays; and it mu&s;t be owned, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, that the charge is true. However, I could have made them more metaphy&s;ical had I thought fit, but I would a&s;k whether in a &s;hort e&s;&s;ay it is not nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;uperficial? Before we have prepared to enter into the depths of a &s;ubject, in the u&s;ual forms, we have got to the bottom of our &s;canty page, and thus lo&s;e the honours of a victory by too tedious a preparation for the com|bat.</P>
<P>There is another fault in this collection of trifles, which I fear will not be &s;o ea&s;ily pardoned. It will be alledged that the humour of them (if any be found) is &s;tale and hackneyed. This may be true enough as matters now &s;tand, but I may with great truth a&s;&s;ert, that the humour was new when I wrote it. Since that time indeed, many of the topics which were fir&s;t &s;tarted here, have been hunted down, and many of the thoughts blown upon. In fact, the&s;e e&s;&s;ays were con&s;ider|ed as quietly laid in the grave of oblivion, and our modern compilers, like &s;extons and executi|oners, think it their undoubted right to pillage the dead.</P>
<P>However, whatever right I have to complain of the public, they can, as yet, have no ju&s;t rea&s;on to complain of me. If I have written dull E&s;&s;ays, they have hitherto treated them as dull E&s;&s;ays.
<PB N="iv" REF="8">
Thus far we are, at lea&s;t, upon par, and until they think fit to make me their humble debtor, by prai&s;e, I am re&s;olved not to lo&s;e a &s;ingle inch of my &s;elf-importance. In&s;tead, therefore, of at|tempting to e&s;tabli&s;h a credit among&s;t them, it will perhaps be wi&s;er to apply to &s;ome more di&s;tant corre&s;pondent, and as my drafts are in &s;ome dan|ger of being prote&s;ted at home, it may not be imprudent upon this occa&s;ion, to draw my bills upon po&s;terity. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr Po&s;terity. Sir, Nine hun|dred and ninety-nine years after &s;ight hereof, pay the bearer, or order, a thou&s;and pound's worth of prai&s;e, free from all deductions what|&s;oever, it being a commodity that will then be very &s;erviceable to him, and place it to the ac|compt of, &amp;c."</Q></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY I.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not, perhaps, a more whim&s;ical figure in nature, than a man of real mode&s;ty who a&s;&s;umes an air of impudence; who, while his heart beats with anxiety, &s;tudies ea&s;e and affects good humour. In this &s;ituation, however, every unexperienced writer finds him&s;elf. Impre&s;&s;ed with the terrors of the tribunal before which he is going to ap|pear, his natural humour turns to pertne&s;s, and for real wit he is obliged to &s;ub&s;titute vivacity.</P>
<P>For my part, as I was never di&s;tingui&s;hed for addre&s;s, and have often even blundered in making my bow, I am at a lo&s;s whether to be merry or &s;ad on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion. Should I mode&s;tly decline all merit, it is too probable the ha&s;ty reader may take me at my word. If, on the other hand, like labourers in the Magazine-trade, I humbly pre&s;ume to promi&s;e an epitome of all the good things that were ever &s;aid or written, tho&s;e readers I mo&s;t de&s;ire to plea&s;e may for|&s;ake me.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">
My book&s;eller, in this dilemma, perceiving my embarra&s;|ment, in&s;tantly offered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You mu&s;t know, Sir,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the republic of letters is at pre&s;ent divided into &s;everal cla&s;&s;es. One writer ex|cels at a plan, or a title-page; another works away the body of the book; and a third is a dab at an index. Thus a Magazine is not the re&s;ult of any &s;ingle man's in|du&s;try; but goes through as many hands as a new pin, before it is fit for the public. I fancy, Sir,"</Q> continues he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I can provide an eminent hand, and upon moderate terms, to draw up a promi&s;ing plan to &s;mooth up our readers a little, and pay them, as Colonel Charters paid his &s;eraglio, at the rate of three halfpence in hand, and three &s;hillings more in promi&s;es."</Q></P>
<P>He was proceeding in his advice, which, however, I thought proper to decline, by a&s;&s;uring him, that, as I in|tended to pur&s;ue no fixed method, &s;o it was impo&s;&s;ible to form any regular plan; determined never to be tedious, in order to be logical; wherever plea&s;ure pre&s;ented, I was re|&s;olved to follow.</P>
<P>It will be improper, therefore, to pall the reader's curio|&s;ity by le&s;&s;ening his &s;urprize, or anticipate any plea&s;ure I am able to procure him, by &s;aying what &s;hall come next. Happy could any effort of mine but repre&s;s one criminal plea&s;ure, or but for a moment fill up an interval of anxiety! How glad|ly would I lead mankind from the vain pro&s;pects of life, to pro&s;pects of innocence and ea&s;e, where every breeze breathes health, and every &s;ound is but the echo of tranquility!</P>
<P>But whatever may be the merit of his intentions, every writer is now convinced that he mu&s;t be chiefly indebted to good fortune for finding readers willing to allow him any de|gree of reputation. It has been remarked, that almo&s;t eve|ry character which has excited either attention or pity, has owed part of its &s;ucce&s;s to merit, and part to an happy con|currence of circum&s;tances in its favour. Had Cae&s;ar or Cromwell
<PB N="11" REF="11">
exchanged countries, the one might have been a &s;er|jeant, and the other an exci&s;eman. So it is with wit, which generally &s;ucceeds more from being happily addre&s;&s;ed, than from its native poignancy. A je&s;t calculated to &s;pread at a gaming table, may be received with perfect indifference, &s;hould it happen to drop in a mackarel-boat. We have all &s;een dunces triumph in &s;ome companies, where men of real humour were di&s;regarded, by a general combination in favour of &s;tupidity. To drive the ob&s;ervation as far as it will go, &s;hould the labours of a writer who de&s;igns his performances for readers of a more refined appetite, fall into the hands of a devourer of compilations, what can he expect but contempt and confu&s;ion? If his merits are to be determined by judges who e&s;timate the value of a book from its bulk, or its fron|ti&s;piece, every rival mu&s;t acquire an ea&s;y &s;uperiority, who, with per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, promi&s;es four pages extraordinary of letter-pre&s;s, or three beautiful prints, curiou&s;ly coloured from nature.</P>
<P>Thus then, though I cannot promi&s;e as much entertain|ment or as much elegance as others have done, yet the reader may be a&s;&s;ured he &s;hall have as much of both as I can. He &s;hall, at lea&s;t, find me alive while I &s;tudy his entertainment; for I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure him, I was never yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ecret of writing and &s;leeping.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of this paper, therefore, all the wit and learning I have, are heartily at his &s;ervice; which if, after &s;o candid a confe&s;&s;ion, he &s;hould notwith&s;tanding &s;till find intolerably dull, or low, or &s;ad &s;tuff, this I prote&s;t is no more than I know. I have a clear con&s;cience, and am entire|ly out of the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Yet I would not have him, upon the peru&s;al of a &s;ingle paper, pronounce me incorrigible; he may try a &s;econd, which, as there is a &s;tudied difference in &s;ubject and &s;tyle, may be more &s;uited to his ta&s;te; if this al&s;o fails, I mu&s;t refer him to a third, or even a fourth, in ca&s;e of extremity: if he &s;hould &s;till
<PB N="12" REF="12">
continue refractory, and find me dull to the la&s;t, I mu&s;t in|form him, with Bays in the Rehear&s;al, that I think him a very odd kind of a fellow, and de&s;ire no more of his ac|quaintance. But &s;till if my readers impute the general te|nor of my &s;ubject to me as a fault, I mu&s;t beg leave to tell them a &s;tory.</P>
<P>A traveller, in his way to Italy, found him&s;elf in a coun|try where the inhabitants had each a large excre&s;cence de|pending from the chin; a deformity which, as it was en|demic, and the people little u&s;ed to &s;trangers, it had been the cu&s;tom, time immemorial, to look upon as the greate&s;t beauty. Ladies grew toa&s;ts from the &s;ize of their chins, and no men were beauxs who&s;e faces were not broade&s;t at the bottom. It was Sunday; a country church was at hand; and our traveller was willing to perform the duties of the day. Upon his fir&s;t appearance at the church-door, the eyes of all were naturally fixed upon the &s;tranger; but what was their amazement, when they found that he actually wanted that emblem of beauty, a pur&s;ed chin. Stifled bur&s;ts of laughter, winks, and whi&s;pers, circulated from vi&s;age to vi&s;age; the pri&s;matic figure of the &s;tranger's face was a fund of infinite gaiety. Our traveller could no longer patiently continue an object for deformity to point at. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good folks,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I perceive that I am a very ri|diculous figure here, but I a&s;&s;ure you I am reckoned no way deformed at HOME."</Q></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE STORY OF ALCANDER AND SEPTIMIUS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TAKEN FROM A BYZANTINE HISTORIAN.</HEAD>
<P>ATHENS, long after the decline of the Roman empire, &s;till continued the &s;eat of learning, politene&s;s, and wi&s;dom. Theodoric, the O&s;trogoth, repaired the &s;chools which bar|barity was &s;uffering to fall into decay, and continued tho&s;e pen&s;ions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had monopolized.</P>
<P>In this city, and about this period, Alcander and Septi|mius were fellow-&s;tudents together. The one, the mo&s;t &s;ubtle rea&s;oner of all the Lyceum; the other, the mo&s;t e|loquent &s;peaker in the Academic Grove. Mutual admiration &s;oon begot a friend&s;hip. Their fortunes were nearly equal, and they were natives of the two mo&s;t celebrated cities in the world: for Alcander was of Athens, Septimius came from Rome.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of harmony they lived for &s;ome time toge|ther, when Alcander, after pa&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t part of his youth in the indolence of philo&s;ophy, thought at length of entering into the bu&s;y world; and, as a &s;tep previous to this, placed his affections on Hypatia, a lady of exqui&s;ite beauty. The day of their intended nuptials was fixed; the previous ceremonies were performed; and nothing now re|mained, but her being conducted in triumph to the apart|ment of the intended bridegroom.</P>
<P>Alcander's exultation in his own happine&s;s, or being unable to enjoy any &s;atisfaction without making his friend Septimius a partner, prevailed upon him to introduce Hypatia
<PB N="14" REF="14">
to his fellow-&s;tudent; which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found him&s;elf equally happy in friend&s;hip and love. But this was an interview fatal to the future peace of both; for Septimius no &s;ooner &s;aw her, but he was &s;mitten with an involuntary pa&s;&s;ion; and, though he u&s;ed every ef|fort to &s;uppre&s;s de&s;ires at once &s;o imprudent and unju&s;t, the emotions of his mind in a &s;hort time became &s;o &s;trong, that they brought on a fever, which the phy&s;icians judged in|curable.</P>
<P>During this illne&s;s, Alcander watched him with all the anxiety of fondne&s;s, and brought his mi&s;tre&s;s to join in tho&s;e amiable offices of friend&s;hip. The &s;agacity of the phy&s;i|cians, by the&s;e means, &s;oon di&s;covered that the cau&s;e of their patient's di&s;order was love; and Alcander being apprized of their di&s;covery, at length extorted a confe&s;&s;ion from the re|luctant dying lover.</P>
<P>It would but delay the narrative to de&s;cribe the conflict between love and friend&s;hip in the brea&s;t of Alcander on this occa&s;ion; it is enough to &s;ay, that the Athenians were at that time arrived at &s;uch refinement in morals, that every virtue was carried to exce&s;s. In &s;hort, forgetful of his own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her charms, to the young Roman. They were married privately by his connivance, and this unlooked-for change of fortune wrought as unexpected a change in the con&s;titution of the now happy Septimius. In a few days he was perfectly recovered, and &s;et out with his fair partner for Rome. Here, by an exer|tion of tho&s;e talents which he was &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, Septimius, in a few years, arrived at the highe&s;t digni|ties of the &s;tate, and was con&s;tituted the city-judge, or praetor.</P>
<P>In the mean time Alcander not only felt the pain of being &s;eparated from his friend and his mi&s;tre&s;s, but a pro&s;ecution was commenced again&s;t him by the relations of Hypatia, for having ba&s;ely given up his bride, as was &s;ugge&s;ted, for money.
<PB N="15" REF="15">
His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, and even his eloquence in his own defence, were not able to with&s;tand the influence of a powerful party. He was ca&s;t and condemned to pay an enormous fine. However, being unable to rai&s;e &s;o large a &s;um at the time appointed, his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were con&s;i&s;|cated, he him&s;elf was &s;tripped of the habit of freedom, ex|po&s;ed as a &s;lave in the market-place, and &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder.</P>
<P>A merchant of Thrace becoming his purcha&s;er, Alcander, with &s;ome other companions of di&s;tre&s;s, was carried into that region of de&s;olation and &s;terility. His &s;tated employ|ment was to follow the herds of an imperious ma&s;ter, and his &s;ucce&s;s in hunting was all that was allowed him to &s;upply his precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of &s;ea&s;on &s;erved but to aggravate his un&s;heltered di&s;tre&s;s. After &s;ome years of bondage, however, an opportunity of e&s;caping offered; he embraced it with ardour; &s;o that travelling by night, and lodging in caverns by day, to &s;horten a long &s;tory, he at la&s;t arrived in Rome. The &s;ame day on which Alcander arrived, Septimius &s;at admini&s;tering ju&s;tice in the Forum, whither our wanderer came, expecting to be in&s;tantly known, and pub|licly acknowledged by his former friend. Here he &s;tood the whole day among&s;t the crowd, watching the eyes of the judge, and expecting to be taken notice of; but he was &s;o much altered by a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hard&s;hips, that he con|tinued unnoted among the re&s;t; and, in the evening, when he was going up to the praetor's chair, he was brutally repul&s;ed by the attending lictors. The attention of the poor is gene|rally driven from one ungrateful object to another; for night coming on, he now found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eek|ing a place to lie in, and yet knew not where to apply. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> emaciated, and in rags as he was, none of the citizens would harbour &s;o much wretchedne&s;s; and &s;leeping in the &s;treets might be attended with interruption or danger: in &s;hort, he
<PB N="16" REF="16">
was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs with|out the city, the u&s;ual retreat of guilt, poverty, and de&s;|pair. In this man&s;ion of horror, laying his head upon an inverted urn, he forgot his mi&s;eries for a while in &s;leep; and found on his flinty couch, more ea&s;e than beds of down can &s;upply to the guilty.</P>
<P>As he continued here, about midnight, two robbers came to make this their retreat; but happening to di&s;agree about the divi&s;ion of their plunder, one of them &s;tabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the entrance. In the&s;e circum&s;tances he was found next morning dead at the mouth of the vault. This naturally inducing a further en|quiry, an alarm was &s;pread; the cave was examined; and Alcander was apprehended and accu&s;ed of robbery and mur|der. The circum&s;tances again&s;t him were &s;trong, and the wretchedne&s;s of his appearance confirmed &s;u&s;picion. Mi&s;|fortune and he were now &s;o long acquainted, that he at la&s;t became regardle&s;s of life. He dete&s;ted a world where he had found only ingratitude, fal&s;hood, and cruelty; he was deter|mined to make no defence; and, thus lowering with re&s;o|lution, he was dragged, bound with cords, before the tribu|nal of Septimius. As the proofs were po&s;itive again&s;t him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication, the judge was proceeding to doom him to a mo&s;t cruel and ignominious death, when the attention of the multitude was &s;oon divided by another object. The robber, who had been really guilty, was apprehended &s;elling his plunder, and, &s;truck with a pa|nic, had confe&s;&s;ed his crime. He was brought bound to the &s;ame tribunal, and acquitted every other per&s;on of any part|ner&s;hip in his guilt. Alcander's innocence therefore appear|ed, but the &s;ullen ra&s;hne&s;s of his conduct remained a wonder to the &s;urrounding multitude; but their a&s;toni&s;hment was &s;till farther increa&s;ed when they &s;aw their judge &s;tart from his tribunal to embrace the &s;uppo&s;ed criminal: Septimus re|collected his friend and former benefactor, and hung upon
<PB N="17" REF="17">
his neck with tears of pity and of joy. Need the &s;equel be related? Alcander was acquitted; &s;hared the friend&s;hip and honours of the principal citizens of Rome; lived afterwards in happine&s;s and ea&s;e; and left it to be engraved on his tomb, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That no circum&s;tances are &s;o de&s;perate which Pro|vidence may not relieve."</Q></P>

<P>WHEN I reflect on the unambitious retirement in which I pa&s;&s;ed the earlier part of my life in the country, I cannot avoid feeling &s;ome pain in thinking that tho&s;e happy days are never to return. In that retreat all nature &s;eemed capable of affording plea&s;ure; I then made no refinements on happine&s;s, but could be plea&s;ed with the mo&s;t aukward efforts of ru&s;tic mirth, thought cro&s;s-purpo&s;es the highe&s;t &s;tretch of human wit, and que&s;tions and commands the mo&s;t rational way of &s;pending the evening. Happy could &s;o charming an illu&s;ion &s;till continue! I find that age and knowledge only contri|bute to &s;our our di&s;po&s;itions. My pre&s;ent enjoyments may be more refined, but they are infinitely le&s;s plea&s;ing. The plea&s;ure the be&s;t actor gives, can no way compare to that I have received from a country-wag who imitated a quaker's &s;ermon. The mu&s;ic of the fine&s;t &s;inger is di&s;&s;onance to what I felt when our old dairy-maid &s;ung me into tears with Johnny Arm&s;trong's La&s;t Good night, or the Cruelty of Barbara Allen.</P>
<P>Writers of every age have endeavoured to &s;hew that plea|&s;ure is in us, and not in the objects offered for our amu&s;e|ment. If the &s;oul be happily di&s;po&s;ed, every thing becomes capable of affording entertainment, and di&s;tre&s;s will almo&s;t
<PB N="18" REF="18">
want a name. Every occurrence pa&s;&s;es in review like the figures of a proce&s;&s;ion; &s;ome may be aukward, others ill|dre&s;&s;ed; but none but a fool is for this enraged with the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>I remember to have once &s;een a &s;lave in a fortification in Flanders, who appeared no way touched with his &s;ituation. He was maimed, deformed, and chained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day till night-fall, and condemned to this for life; yet, with all the&s;e circum&s;tances of apparent wretchedne&s;s, he &s;ung, would have danced but that he want|ed a leg, and appeared the merrie&s;t, happie&s;t man of all the garri&s;on. What a practical philo&s;opher was here! an happy con&s;titution &s;upplied philo&s;ophy; and, though &s;eemingly de&s;|titute of wi&s;dom, he was really wi&s;e. No reading or &s;tudy had contributed to di&s;enchant the fairy-land around him. Every thing furni&s;hed him with an opportunity of mirth; and, though &s;ome thought him, from his in&s;en&s;ibility, a fool, he was &s;uch an ideot as philo&s;ophers &s;hould wi&s;h to imi|tate; for all philo&s;ophy is only forcing the trade of happi|ne&s;s, when nature &s;eems to deny the means.</P>
<P>They who, like our &s;lave, can place them&s;elves on that &s;ide of the world in which every thing appears in a plea&s;ing light, will find &s;omething in every occurrence to excite their good humour. The mo&s;t calamitous events, either to them|&s;elves or others, can bring no new affliction; the whole world is to them a theatre, on which comedies only are act|ed. All the bu&s;tle of heroi&s;m, or the rants of ambition, &s;erve only to heighten the ab&s;urdity of the &s;cene, and make the humour more poignant. They feel, in &s;hort, as little angui&s;h at their own di&s;tre&s;s, or the complaints of others, as the undertaker, though dre&s;&s;ed in black, feels &s;orrow at a funeral.</P>
<P>Of all the men I ever read of, the famous Cardinal de Retz po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this happine&s;s of temper in the highe&s;t de|gree. As he was a man of gallantry, and de&s;pi&s;ed all that
<PB N="19" REF="19">
wore the pedantic appearance of philo&s;ophy, wherever plea&s;ure was to be &s;old, he was generally foremo&s;t to rai&s;e the auction. Being an univer&s;al admirer of the fair &s;ex, when he found one lady cruel, he generally fell in love with another, from whom he expected a more favourable reception: if &s;he too rejected his addre&s;&s;es, he never thought of retiring into de|&s;arts, or pining in hopele&s;s di&s;tre&s;s. He per&s;uaded him&s;elf, that, in&s;tead of loving the lady, he only fancied that he had loved her, and &s;o all was well again. When fortune wore her angrie&s;t look, and he at la&s;t fell into the power of his mo&s;t deadly enemy Cardinal Mazarine (being confined a clo&s;e pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle of Valenciennes) he never attempted to &s;upport his di&s;tre&s;s by wi&s;dom or philo&s;ophy, for he pre|tended to neither. He only laughed at him&s;elf and his per|&s;ecutor, and &s;eemed infinitely plea&s;ed at his new &s;ituation. In this man&s;ion of di&s;tre&s;s, though &s;ecluded from his friends, though denied all the amu&s;ements, and even the conveniences of life, he &s;till retained his good humour; laughed at all the little &s;pite of his enemies; and carried the je&s;t &s;o far as to be revenged by writing the life of his goaler.</P>
<P>All that the wi&s;dom of the proud can teach, is to be &s;tubborn or &s;ullen under misfortunes. The Cardinal's example will in&s;truct us to be merry in circum&s;tances of the highe&s;t afflic|tion. It matters not whether our good humour be con&s;trued by others into in&s;en&s;ibility, or even idioti&s;m; it is happine&s;s to our&s;elves, and none but a fool would mea&s;ure his &s;atisfac|tion by what the world thinks of it: for my own part, I ne|ver pa&s;s by one of our pri&s;ons for debt, that I do not envy that felicity which is &s;till going forward among tho&s;e people who forget the cares of the world by being &s;hut out from its ambition.</P>
<P>The happie&s;t &s;illy fellow I ever knew, was of the number of tho&s;e good-natured creatures that are &s;aid to do no harm to any but them&s;elves. Whenever he fell into any mi&s;ery, he u&s;ually called it Seeing Life. If his head was broke by
<PB N="20" REF="20">
a chairman, or his pocket picked by a &s;harper, he comforted him&s;elf by imitating the Hibernian dialect of the one, or the more fa&s;hionable cant of the other. Nothing came ami&s;s to him. His inattention to money-matters had incen&s;ed his fa|ther to &s;uch a degree, that all the interce&s;&s;ion of friends in his favour was fruitle&s;s. The old gentleman was on his death|bed. The whole family, and Dick among the number, ga|thered around him.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I leave my &s;econd &s;on, Andrew,"</Q> &s;aid the expiring mi&s;er, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my whole e&s;tate, and de&s;ire him to be frugal."</Q> Andrew, in a &s;orrowful tone, as is u&s;ual on the&s;e occa&s;ions, prayed heaven to prolong his life and health to enjoy it him&s;elf.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I recommend Simon, my third &s;on, to the care of his elder brother, and leave him be&s;ide four thou&s;and pounds."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah! father,"</Q> cried Simon, (in great affliction to be &s;ure) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"may heaven give you life and health to enjoy it your&s;elf."</Q> At la&s;t, turning to poor Dick, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As for you, you have always been a &s;ad dog; you'll never come to good; you'll never be rich; I'll leave you a &s;hilling to buy a halter."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah! father,"</Q> cries Dick, without any emotion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"may heaven give you life and health to enjoy it your&s;elf."</Q> This was all the trouble the lo&s;s of fortune gave this thoughtle&s;s imprudent creature. However, the tenderne&s;s of an uncle recompen&s;ed the neglect of a father; and my friend is now not only ex|ce&s;&s;ively good-humoured, but competently rich.</P>
<P>Yes, let the world cry out at a bankrupt who appears at a ball; at an author who laughs at the public which pronounces him a dunce; at a general who &s;miles at the reproach of the vulgar, or the lady who keeps her good humour in &s;pite of &s;candal; but &s;uch is the wi&s;e&s;t behaviour that any of us can po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;ume; it is certainly a better way to oppo&s;e cala|mity by di&s;&s;ipation than to take up the arms of rea&s;on or re|&s;olution to oppo&s;e it: by the fir&s;t method, we forget our mi&s;eries; by the la&s;t, we only conceal them from others; by &s;truggling with misfortunes, we are &s;ure to receive &s;ome
<PB N="21" REF="21">
wounds in the conflict; but a &s;ure method to come off victorious, is by running away.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY IV.</HEAD>
<P>I REMEMBER to have read in &s;ome philo&s;opher (I believe in Tom Brown's works) that, let a man's character, &s;enti|ments, or complexion, be what they will, he can find com|pany in London to match them. If he be &s;plenetic, he may every day meet companions on the &s;eats in St. James's Park, with who&s;e groans he may mix his own, and pathetically talk of the weather. If he be pa&s;&s;ionate, he may vent his rage among the old orators at Slaughter's coffee-hou&s;e, and damn the nation becau&s;e it keeps him from &s;tarving. If he be phlegmatic, he may &s;it in &s;ilence at the Hum-drum club in Ivey-lane; and, if actually mad, he may find very good company in Moor-fields, either at Bedlam, or the Foundery, ready to cultivate a nearer acquaintance.</P>
<P>But, although &s;uch as have a knowledge of the town may ea&s;ily cla&s;s them&s;elves with tempers congenial to their own, a countryman who comes to live in London finds nothing more difficult. With regard to my&s;elf, none ever tried with more a&s;&s;iduity, or came off with &s;uch indifferent &s;ucce&s;s. I &s;pent a whole &s;ea&s;on in the &s;earch, during which time my name has been enrolled in &s;ocieties, lodges, convocations, and meetings without number. To &s;ome I was introduced by a friend, to others invited by an adverti&s;ement: to the&s;e I introduced my&s;elf, and to tho&s;e I changed my name to gain admittance. In &s;hort, no coquette was ever more &s;olicitous to match her ribbons to her complexion, than I to &s;uit my
<PB N="22" REF="22">
club to my temper, for I was too ob&s;tinate to bring my tem|per to conform to it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t club I entered, upon coming to town, was that of the Choice Spirits. The name was entirely &s;uited to my ta&s;te; I was a lover of mirth, good-humour, and even &s;ome|times of fun, from my childhood.</P>
<P>As no other pa&s;&s;port was requi&s;ite but the payment of two &s;hillings at the door, I introduced my&s;elf without farther cere|mony to the members, who were already a&s;&s;embled, and had, for &s;ome time, begun upon bu&s;ine&s;s. The Grand, with a mal|let in his hand, pre&s;ided at the head of the table. I could not avoid, upon my entrance, making u&s;e of all my &s;kill in phy&s;iognomy, in order to di&s;cover that &s;uperiority of ge|nius in men, who had taken a title &s;o &s;uperior to the re&s;t of mankind. I expected to &s;ee the lines of every face marked with &s;trong thinking; but though I had &s;ome &s;kill in this &s;cience, I could for my life di&s;cover nothing but a pert &s;im|per, fat, or profound &s;tupidity.</P>
<P>My &s;peculations were &s;oon interrupted by the Grand, who had knocked down Mr. Spriggins for a &s;ong. I was, upon this, whi&s;pered by one of the company who &s;at next me, that I &s;hould now &s;ee &s;omething touched off to a nicety, for Mr. Spriggins was going to give us Mad Tom in all its glo|ry. Mr. Spriggins endeavoured to excu&s;e him&s;elf; for, as he was to act a mad-man and a king, it was impo&s;&s;ible to go through the part properly without a crown and chains. His excu&s;es were over-ruled by a great majority, and with much vociferation. The Pre&s;ident ordered up the jack-chain, and, in&s;tead of a crown, our performer covered his brows with an inverted jordan. After he had rattled his chain, and &s;hook his head, to the great delight of the whole company, he began his &s;ong. As I have heard few young fellows offer to &s;ing in company that did not expo&s;e them&s;elves, it was no great di&s;appointment to me to find Mr. Spriggins among the number; however, not to &s;eem an odd fi&s;h, I ro&s;e from my
<PB N="23" REF="23">
&s;eat in rapture, cried out, Bravo! Encore! and &s;lapped the table as loud as any of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The gentleman who &s;at next me &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed with my ta&s;te and the ardour of my approbation; and whi&s;|pering told me, that I had &s;uffered an immen&s;e lo&s;s; for, had I come a few minutes &s;ooner, I might have heard Gee-ho Dobbin &s;ung in a tip-top manner by the pimple-no&s;ed &s;pirit at the Pre&s;ident's right elbow; but he was evaporated before I came.</P>
<P>As I was expre&s;&s;ing my unea&s;ine&s;s at this di&s;appointment, I found the attention of the company employed upon a fat figure, who, with a voice more rough than the Stafford&s;hire giant's, was giving us the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Softly &s;weet, in Lydian mea|&s;ure,"</Q> of Alexander's Fea&s;t. After a &s;hort pau&s;e of ad|miration, to this &s;ucceeded a Welch dialogue, with the hu|mours of Teague and Taffy: after that came on Old Jack|&s;on, with a &s;tory between every &s;tanza: next was &s;ung the Du&s;t-cart, and then Solomon's Song. The gla&s;s began now to circulate pretty freely; tho&s;e who were &s;ilent when &s;ober, would now be heard in their turn; every man had his &s;ong, and he &s;aw no rea&s;on why he &s;hould not be heard as well as any of the re&s;t: one begged to be heard while he gave Death and the Lady in high ta&s;te; another &s;ung to a plate which he kept trundling on the edges; nothing was now heard but &s;inging; voice ro&s;e above voice, and the whole became one univer&s;al &s;hout, when the landlord came to ac|quaint the company that the reckoning was drank out. Ra|belais calls the moments in which a reckoning is mentioned, the mo&s;t melancholy of our lives: never was &s;o much noi&s;e &s;o quickly quelled, as by this &s;hort but pathetic oration of our landlord: Drank out! was echoed in a tone of di&s;|content round the table: Drank out already! that was very odd! that &s;o much punch could be drank out alrea|dy! impo&s;&s;ible! The landlord, however, &s;eeming re&s;olved not to retreat from his fir&s;t a&s;&s;urances, the company
<PB N="24" REF="24">
was di&s;&s;olved, and a Pre&s;ident cho&s;en for the night en|&s;uing.</P>
<P>A friend of mine, to whom I was complaining &s;ome time after of the entertainment I have been de&s;cribing, propo&s;ed to bring me to the club that he frequented; which, he fancied, would &s;uit the gravity of my temper exactly. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We have, at the Muzzy Club,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"no riotous mirth nor aukward ribaldry; no confu&s;ion or bawling; all is conducted with wi&s;dom and decency: be&s;ides, &s;ome of our members are worth forty thou&s;and pounds; men of prudence and fore&s;ight every one of them: the&s;e are the proper acquaintance, and to &s;uch I will to-night introduce you."</Q> I was charmed at the propo&s;al: to be acquainted with men worth forty thou&s;and pounds, and to talk wi&s;dom the whole night, were offers that threw me into rapture.</P>
<P>At &s;even o'clock I was accordingly introduced by my friend, not indeed to the company; for, though I made my be&s;t bow, they &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible of my approach, but to the table at which they were &s;itting. Upon my entering the room, I could not avoid feeling a &s;ecret veneration from the &s;olemnity of the &s;cene before me; the members kept a pro|found &s;ilence, each with a pipe in his mouth and a pewter|pot in his hand, and with faces which might ea&s;ily be con|&s;trued into ab&s;olute wi&s;dom. Happy &s;ociety, thought I to my&s;elf, where the members think before they &s;peak, deliver nothing ra&s;hly, but convey their thoughts to each other pregnant with meaning, and matured by reflection.</P>
<P>In this plea&s;ing &s;peculation I continued a full half hour, expecting each moment that &s;omebody would begin to open his mouth; every time the pipe was laid down I expected it was to &s;peak, but it was only to &s;pit. At length, re&s;olving to break the charm my&s;elf, and overcome their extreme diffidence (for to this I imputed their &s;ilence) I rubbed my hands, and looking as wi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, ob&s;erved that the nights began to grow a little cooli&s;h at this time of the year.
<PB N="25" REF="25">
This, as it was directed to none of the company in particular, none thought him&s;elf obliged to an&s;wer; wherefore I con|tinued &s;till to rub my hands and look wi&s;e. My next effort was addre&s;&s;ed to a gentleman who &s;at next me, to whom I ob&s;erved, that the beer was extreme good; my neighbour made no reply, but by a large puff of tobacco &s;moak.</P>
<P>I now began to be unea&s;y in this dumb &s;ociety, till one of them a little relieved me by ob&s;erving, that bread had not ri&s;en the&s;e three weeks: <Q REND="inline">"Aye,"</Q> &s;ays another, &s;till keeping the pipe in his mouth, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that puts me in mind of a plea&s;ant &s;tory about that&mdash;hem&mdash;very well; you mu&s;t know&mdash;but, before I begin&mdash;Sir, my &s;ervice to you&mdash;where was I?"</Q></P>
<P>My next club goes by the name of the Harmonical So|ciety; probably from that love of order and friend&s;hip which every per&s;on commends in in&s;titutions of this nature. The landlord was him&s;elf founder. The money &s;pent is four-pence each; and they &s;ometimes whip for a double reckoning. To this club few recommendations are requi&s;ite, except the introductory four-pence and my landlord's good word, which, as he gains by it, he never refu&s;es.</P>
<P>We all here talked and behaved as every body el&s;e u&s;ually does on his club-night. We di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the topic of the day, drank each others healths, &s;nuffed the candles with our fingers, and filled our pipes from the &s;ame plate of tobacco. The company &s;aluted each other in the common manner. Mr. Bellows-mender hoped Mr. Curry-comb-maker had not caught cold going home the la&s;t club-night; and he returned the compliment by hoping young Ma&s;ter Bellows-mender had got well again of the chin-cough. Doctor Twi&s;t told us a &s;tory of a parliament-man with whom he was intimately acquaint|ed; while the bug-man, at the &s;ame time, was telling a better &s;tory of a noble lord with whom he could do any thing. A gentleman in a black wig and leather breeches, at t'other end of the table, was engaged in a long narrative
<PB N="26" REF="26">
of the Gho&s;t in Cock-lane: he had read it in the papers of the day, and was telling it to &s;ome that &s;at next him who could not read. Near him Mr. Dibbins was di&s;puting on the old &s;ubject of religion with a Jew pedlar, over the table; while the Pre&s;ident in vain knocked down Mr. Leather&s;ides for a &s;ong. Be&s;ides the combinations of the&s;e voices, which I could hear altogether, and which formed an upper part to the concert, there were &s;everal others playing under-parts by them&s;elves, and endeavouring to fa&s;ten on &s;ome luckle&s;s neighbour's ear, who was him&s;elf bent upon the &s;ame de|&s;ign again&s;t &s;ome other.</P>
<P>We have often heard of the &s;peech of a corporation, and this induced me to tran&s;cribe a &s;peech of this club, taken in &s;hort-hand, word for word, as it was &s;poken by every mem|ber of the company. It may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the man who told of the gho&s;t had the loude&s;t voice, and the longe&s;t &s;tory to tell, &s;o that his continuing narrative filled every cha&s;m in the conver&s;ation.</P>

<P>Were I to be angry at men for being fools, I could here find ample room for declamation; but, alas! I have been a fool my&s;elf; and why &s;hould I be angry with them for being &s;omething &s;o natural to every child of hu|manity?</P>
<P>Fatigued with this &s;ociety, I was introduced, the fol|lowing night, to a club of fa&s;hion. On taking my place, I found the conver&s;ation &s;ufficiently ea&s;y, and tolerably good-natured; for my lord and Sir Paul were not yet ar|rived. I now thought my&s;elf completely fitted, and re&s;olv|ing to &s;eek no farther, determined to take up my re&s;idence here for the winter; while my temper began to open in&s;en|&s;ibly to the cheerfulne&s;s I &s;aw diffu&s;ed on every face in the room: but the delu&s;ion &s;oon vani&s;hed, when the waiter came to apprize us, that his lord&s;hip and Sir Paul were ju&s;t arrived.</P>
<P>From this moment all our felicity was at an end; our new gue&s;ts bu&s;tled into the room, and took their &s;eats at the head of the table. Adieu now all confidence; every creature &s;trove who &s;hould mo&s;t recommend him&s;elf to our members of di|&s;tinction. Each &s;eemed quite regardle&s;s of plea&s;ing any but
<PB N="28" REF="28">
our new gue&s;ts; and, what before wore the appearance of friend&s;hip, was now turned into rivalry.</P>
<P>Yet I could not ob&s;erve that, amid&s;t all this flattery and ob|&s;equious attention, our great men took any notice of the re&s;t of the company. Their whole di&s;cour&s;e was addre&s;&s;ed to each other. Sir Paul told his lord&s;hip a long &s;tory of Mora|via the Jew; and his lord&s;hip gave Sir Paul a very long ac|count of his new method of managing &s;ilk-worms: he led him, and con&s;equently the re&s;t of the company, through all the &s;tages of feeding, &s;unning, and hatching; with an epi&s;ode on mulberry-trees, a digre&s;&s;ion upon gra&s;s-&s;eeds, and a long pa|renthe&s;is about his new po&s;tilion. In this manner we travel|led on, wi&s;hing every &s;tory to be the la&s;t; but all in vain;
<Q><L>"Hills over hills, and Alps on Alps aro&s;e."</L></Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t club in which I was inrolled a member, was a &s;o|ciety of moral philo&s;ophers, as they called them&s;elves, who a&s;|&s;embled twice a week, in order to &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of the pre&s;ent mode of religion, and e&s;tabli&s;h a new one in its &s;tead.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY V.</HEAD>
<P>IT is u&s;ually &s;aid by grammarians, that the u&s;e of language is to expre&s;s our wants and de&s;ires; but men who know the world hold, and I think with &s;ome &s;hew of rea&s;on, that he who be&s;t knows how to keep his nece&s;&s;ities private, is the mo&s;t likely per&s;on to have them redre&s;&s;ed; and that the true u&s;e of &s;peech is not &s;o much to expre&s;s our wants, as to con|ceal them.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the manner in which mankind gene|rally confer their favours, there appears &s;omething &s;o attrac|tive in riches, that the large heap generally collects from the &s;maller: and the poor find as much plea&s;ure in increa&s;ing the enormous ma&s;s of the rich, as the mi&s;er, who owns it, &s;ees happine&s;s in its increa&s;e. Nor is there in this any thing re|pugnant to the laws of morality. Seneca him&s;elf allows, that, in conferring benefits, the pre&s;ent &s;hould always be &s;uited to the dignity of the receiver. Thus the rich receive large pre|&s;ents, and are thanked for accepting them. Men of middling &s;tations are obliged to be content with pre&s;ents &s;omething le&s;s; while the beggar, who may be truly &s;aid to want indeed, is well paid if a farthing rewards his warme&s;t &s;olicitations.</P>
<P>Every man who has &s;een the world, and has had his ups and downs in life, as the expre&s;&s;ion is, mu&s;t have frequently experienced the truth of this doctrine; and mu&s;t know, that to have much, or to &s;eem to have it, is the only way to have more. Ovid finely compares a man of broken fortune to a fal|ling column; the lower it &s;inks, the greater weight it is obli|ged to &s;u&s;tain. Thus, when a man's circum&s;tances are &s;uch, that he has no occa&s;ion to borrow, he finds numbers willing to lend him; but, &s;hould his wants be &s;uch that he &s;ues for a trifle, it is two to one whether he may be tru&s;ted with the &s;malle&s;t &s;um.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="31">
A certain young fellow whom I knew, whenever he had occa&s;ion to a&s;k his friend for a guinea, u&s;ed to prelude his re|que&s;t as if he wanted two hundred; and talked &s;o familiarly of large &s;ums, that none could ever think he wanted a &s;mall one. The &s;ame gentleman, whenever he wanted credit for a &s;uit of cloaths, always made the propo&s;al in a laced coat; for he found by experience, that, if he appeared &s;habby on the&s;e occa&s;ions, his taylor had taken an oath again&s;t tru&s;ting; or what was every whit as bad, his foreman was out of the way, and &s;hould not be at home for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>There can be no inducement to reveal our wants, except to find pity, and by this means relief; but before a poor man opens his mind in &s;uch circum&s;tances, he &s;hould fir&s;t con&s;ider whether he is contented to lo&s;e the e&s;teem of the per&s;on he &s;olicits, and whether he is willing to give up friend&s;hip to ex|cite compa&s;&s;ion. Pity and friend&s;hip are pa&s;&s;ions incompati|ble with each other; and it is impo&s;&s;ible that both can re&s;ide in any brea&s;t, for the &s;malle&s;t &s;pace, without impairing each other. Friend&s;hip is made up of e&s;teem and plea&s;ure; pity is compo&s;ed of &s;orrow and contempt; the mind may, for &s;ome time, fluctuate between them, but it can never entertain both at once.</P>
<P>In fact, pity, though it may often relieve, is but, at be&s;t, a &s;hort-lived pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;eldom affords di&s;tre&s;s more than tran&s;itory a&s;&s;i&s;tance: with &s;ome, it &s;carce la&s;ts from the fir&s;t impul&s;e till the hand can be put into the pocket; with others, it may continue for twice that &s;pace; and on &s;ome of extraor|dinary &s;en&s;ibility, I have &s;een it operate for half an hour to|gether: but &s;till, la&s;t as it may, it generally produces but beggarly effects; and where, from this motive, we give five farthings, from others, we give pounds: whatever be our feelings from the fir&s;t impul&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s, when the &s;ame di|&s;tre&s;s &s;olicits a &s;econd time, we then feel with dimini&s;hed &s;en|&s;ibility; and like the repetition of an echo, every &s;troke becomes
<PB N="32" REF="32">
weaker; till at la&s;t, our &s;en&s;ations lo&s;e all mixture of &s;orrow, and degenerate into downright contempt.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;peculations bring to my mind the fate of a very good-natured fellow, who is now no more. He was bred in a counting-hou&s;e, and his father dying ju&s;t as he was out of his time, left him an hand&s;ome fortune, and many friends to advi&s;e with. The re&s;traint in which my friend had been brought up, had thrown a gloom upon his temper, which &s;ome regarded as prudence; and, from &s;uch con&s;iderations, he had every day repeated offers of friend&s;hip. Such as had mo|ney, were ready to offer him their a&s;&s;i&s;tance that way; and they who had daughters, frequently, in the warmth of affec|tion, advi&s;ed him to marry. My friend, however, was in good circum&s;tances; he wanted neither money, friends, nor a wife; and therefore mode&s;tly declined their propo&s;als.</P>
<P>Some errors, however, in the management of his affairs, and &s;everal lo&s;&s;es in trade, &s;oon brought him to a different way of thinking; and he at la&s;t con&s;idered, that it was his be&s;t way to let his friends know that their offers were at length acceptable. His fir&s;t addre&s;s was to a &s;crivener, who had formerly made him frequent offers of money and friend|&s;hip, at a time when, perhaps, he knew tho&s;e offers would have been refu&s;ed. As a man, therefore, confident of not being refu&s;ed, he reque&s;ted the u&s;e of an hundred guineas for a few days, as he ju&s;t then had occa&s;ion for money. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And pray, Sir,"</Q> replied the &s;crivener, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"do you want all this money?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Want it, Sir?"</Q> &s;ays the other, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if I did not want it I &s;hould not have a&s;ked it."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am &s;orry for that,"</Q> &s;ays the friend, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for tho&s;e who want money when they bor|row, will always want money when they &s;hould come to pay. To &s;ay the truth, Sir, money is money now; and I believe it is all &s;unk in the bottom of the &s;ea, for my part; he that has got a little is a fool if he does not keep what he has got."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="33">
Not quite di&s;concerted by this refu&s;al, our adventurer was re&s;olved to apply to another, whom he knew was the very be&s;t friend he had in the world. The gentleman whom he now addre&s;&s;ed, received his propo&s;al with all the affability that could be expected from generous friend&s;hip. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let me &s;ee, you want an hundred guineas; and pray, dear Jack, would not fifty an&s;wer?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If you have but fifty to &s;pare, Sir, I mu&s;t be contented."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fifty to &s;pare; I do not &s;ay that, for I believe I have but twenty about me."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then I mu&s;t borrow the other thirty from &s;ome other friend."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And pray,"</Q> replied the friend, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"would it not be the be&s;t way to borrow the whole money from that other friend, and then one note will &s;erve for all, you know? You know, my dear Sir, that you need make no ceremony with me at any time; you know I'm your friend; and when you chu&s;e a bit of dinner, or &s;o&mdash;You, Tom, &s;ee the gentleman down. You won't forget to dine with us now and then. Your very humble &s;ervant."</Q></P>
<P>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, but not di&s;couraged, at this treatment, he was at la&s;t re&s;olved to find that a&s;&s;i&s;tance from love, which he could not have from friend&s;hip. A young lady, a di&s;tant re|lation by the mother's &s;ide, had a fortune in her own hands; and, as &s;he had already made all the advances that her &s;ex's mode&s;ty would permit, he made his propo&s;al with confidence. He &s;oon, however, perceived, That no bankrupt ever found the fair one kind. She had lately fallen deeply in love with another, who had more money, and the whole neighbourhood thought it would be a match.</P>
<P>Every day now began to &s;trip my poor friend of his for|mer finery; his cloaths flew, piece by piece, to the pawnbro|ker's, and he &s;eemed at length equipped in the genuine livery of misfortune. But &s;till he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure from actu|al nece&s;&s;ity; the numberle&s;s invitations he had received to dine, even after his lo&s;&s;es, were yet unan&s;wered; he was therefore now re&s;olved to accept of a dinner, becau&s;e he wanted
<PB N="34" REF="34">
one; and in this manner he actually lived among his friends a whole week without being openly affronted. The la&s;t place I &s;aw him in was at a reverend divine's. He had, as he fancied, ju&s;t nicked the time of dinner, for he came in as the cloth was laying. He took a chair without being de|&s;ired, and talked for &s;ome time without being attended to. He a&s;&s;ured the company, that nothing procured &s;o good an appetite as a walk in the Park, where he had been that mor|ning. He went on, and prai&s;ed the figure of the dama&s;k table|cloth; talked of a fea&s;t where he had been the day before, but that the veni&s;on was over-done. But all this procured him no invitation: finding therefore the gentleman of the hou&s;e in&s;en&s;ible to all his fetches, he thought proper, at la&s;t, to retire, and mend his appetite by a &s;econd walk in the Park.</P>
<P>You then, O ye beggars of my acquaintance, whether in rags or lace; whether in Kent-&s;treet or the Mall; whether at the Smyrna or St Giles's, might I be permitted to advi&s;e as a friend, never &s;eem to want the favour which you &s;olicit. Ap|ply to every pa&s;&s;ion but human pity for redre&s;s: you may find permanent relief from vanity, from &s;elf-intere&s;t, or from ava|rice, but from compa&s;&s;ion never. The very eloquence of a poor man is di&s;gu&s;ting; and that mouth which is opened even by wi&s;dom, is &s;eldom expected to clo&s;e without the horrors of a petition.</P>
<P>To ward off the gripe of poverty, you mu&s;t pretend to be a &s;tranger to her, and &s;he will at lea&s;t u&s;e you with ceremony. If you be caught dining upon a halfpenny porrenger of pea&s;e|&s;oup and potatoes, prai&s;e the whole&s;omne&s;s of your frugal re|pa&s;t. You may ob&s;erve, that Dr Cheyne has pre&s;cribed pea&s;e-broth for the gravel; hint that you are not one of tho&s;e who are always making a deity of your belly. If, again, you are obliged to wear a flim&s;y &s;tuff in the mid&s;t of winter, be the fir&s;t to remark, that &s;tuffs are very much worn at Paris; or, if there be found &s;ome irreparable defects in any part of
<PB N="35" REF="35">
your equipage, which cannot be concealed by all the arts of &s;itting cro&s;s-legged, coaxing, or derning, &s;ay, that neither you nor Samp&s;on Gideon were ever very fond of dre&s;s. If you be a philo&s;opher, hint that Plato or Seneca are the taylors you choo&s;e to employ; a&s;&s;ure the company that man ought to be content with a bare covering, &s;ince what now is &s;o much his pride, was formerly his &s;hame. In &s;hort, however caught, never give out; but a&s;cribe to the frugality of your di&s;po&s;ition what others might be apt to attribute to the narrowne&s;s of your circum&s;tances. To be poor, and to &s;eem poor, is a cer|tain method never to ri&s;e: pride in the great is hateful: in the wi&s;e it is ridiculous; but beggarly pride is a rational va|nity, which I have been taught to applaud and excu&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY VI.</HEAD>
<P>LYSIPPUS is a man who&s;e greatne&s;s of &s;oul the whole world admires. His genero&s;ity is &s;uch, that it prevents a de|mand, and &s;aves the receiver the trouble and the confu&s;ion of a reque&s;t. His liberality al&s;o does not oblige more by its greatne&s;s than by his inimitable grace in giving. Sometimes he even di&s;tributes his bounties to &s;trangers, and has been known to do good offices to tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves his enemies. All the world are unanimous in the prai&s;e of his genero&s;ity; there is only one &s;ort of people who complain of his conduct. Ly&s;ippus does not pay his debts.</P>
<P>It is no difficult matter to account for a conduct &s;o &s;eem|ingly in ompatible with it&s;elf. There is greatne&s;s in being generous, and there is only &s;imple ju&s;tice in his &s;atisfying cre|ditors. Genero&s;ity is the part of a &s;oul rai&s;ed above the vul|gar. There is in it &s;omething of what we admire in heroes,
<PB N="36" REF="36">
and prai&s;e with a degree of rapture. Ju&s;tice, on the contra|ry, is a mere mechanic virtue, only fit for trade&s;men, and what is practi&s;ed by every broker in Change-alley.</P>
<P>In paying his debts a man barely does his duty, and it is an action attended with no &s;ort of glory. Should Ly&s;ippus &s;atis|fy his creditors, who would be at the pains of telling it to the world? Genero&s;ity is a virtue of a very different complexion. It is rai&s;ed above duty; and, from its elevation, attracts the attention and the prai&s;es of us little mortals below.</P>
<P>In this manner do men generally rea&s;on upon ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity. The fir&s;t is de&s;pi&s;ed, though a virtue e&s;&s;ential to the good of &s;ociety, and the other attracts our e&s;teem, which too frequently proceeds from an impetuo&s;ity of temper, rather directed by vanity than rea&s;on. Ly&s;ippus is told that his banker a&s;ks a debt of forty pounds, and that a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ac|quaintance petitions for the &s;ame &s;um. He gives it without he&s;itating to the latter; for he demands as a favour what the former requires as a debt.</P>
<P>Mankind in general are not &s;ufficiently acquainted with the import of the word ju&s;tice: it is commonly believed to con&s;i&s;t only in a performance of tho&s;e duties to which the laws of &s;o|ciety can oblige us. This, I allow, is &s;ometimes the import of the word; and in this &s;en&s;e ju&s;tice is di&s;tingui&s;hed from e|quity; but there is a ju&s;tice &s;till more exten&s;ive, and which can be &s;hewn to embrace all the virtues united.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice may be defined, that virtue which impels us to give to every per&s;on what is his due. In this extended &s;en&s;e of the word, it comprehends the practice of every virtue which rea&s;on pre&s;cribes, or &s;ociety &s;hould expect. Our duty to our Maker, to each other, and to our&s;elves, are fully an&s;wered, if we give them what we owe them. Thus ju&s;tice, properly &s;peaking, is the only virtue: and all the re&s;t have their origin in it.</P>
<P>The qualities of candour, fortitude, charity, and genero&s;i|y, for in&s;tance, are not in their own nature virtues; and, if
<PB N="37" REF="37">
ever they de&s;erve the title, it is owing only to ju&s;tice, which impels and directs them. Without &s;uch a moderator, candor might become indi&s;cretion; fortitude, ob&s;tinacy; charity, im|prudence; and genero&s;ity, mi&s;taken profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>A di&s;intere&s;ted action, if it be not conducted by ju&s;tice, is, at be&s;t, indifferent in its nature, and not unfrequently even turns to vice. The expences of &s;ociety, of pre&s;ents, of enter|tainments, and the other helps to chearfulne&s;s, are actions merely indifferent, when not repugnant to a better method of di&s;po&s;ing of our &s;uperfluities; but they become vicious when they ob&s;truct or exhau&s;t our abilities from a more virtuous di&s;po&s;ition of our circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>True genero&s;ity is a duty as indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary as tho&s;e impo&s;ed upon us by law. It is a rule impo&s;ed upon us by rea|&s;on, which &s;hould be the &s;overeign law of a rational being. But this genero&s;ity does not con&s;i&s;t in obeying every impul&s;e of humanity, in following blind pa&s;&s;ion for our guide, and im|pairing our circum&s;tances by pre&s;ent benefactions, &s;o as to ren|der us incapable of future ones.</P>
<P>Mi&s;ers are generally characterized as men without honour, or without humanity, who live only to accumulate, and to this pa&s;&s;ion &s;acrifice every other happine&s;s. They have been de&s;cribed as madmen, who, in the mid&s;t of abundance, bani&s;h every plea&s;ure, and make, from imaginary wants, real nece&s;|&s;ities. But few, very few, corre&s;pond to this exaggerated picture; and perhaps, there is not one in whom all the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances are found united. In&s;tead of this, we find the &s;o|ber and the indu&s;trious branded by the vain and the idle with this odious appellation. Men who, by frugality and labour, rai&s;e them&s;elves above their equals, and contribute their &s;hare of indu&s;try to the common &s;tock.</P>
<P>Whatever the vain or the ignorant may &s;ay, well were it for &s;ociety, had we more of the&s;e characters among&s;t us. In general, tho&s;e clo&s;e men are found at la&s;t the true bene|factors of &s;ociety. With an avaricious man we &s;eldom lo&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="38">
in our dealings, but too frequently in our commerce with prodigality.</P>
<P>A French prie&s;t, who&s;e name was Godinot, went for a long time by the name of the Griper. He refu&s;ed to relieve the mo&s;t apparent wretchedne&s;s, and, by a &s;kilful manage|ment of his vineyard, had the good fortune to acquire im|men&s;e &s;ums of money. The inhabitants of Rheims, who were his fellow-citzens, dete&s;ted him; and the populace, who &s;eldom love a mi&s;er, wherever he went, followed him with &s;houts of contempt. He &s;till, however, continued his former &s;implicity of life, his amazing and unremitted frugality. He had long perceived the wants of the poor in the city, particularly in having no water but what they were obliged to buy at an advanced price; wherefore, that whole fortune which he had been ama&s;&s;ing, he laid out in an aque|duct; by which, he did the poor more u&s;eful and la&s;ting &s;ervice, than if he had di&s;tributed his whole income in cha|rity every day at his door.</P>
<P>Among men long conver&s;ant with books, we too frequent|ly find tho&s;e mi&s;placed virtues, of which I have been now complaining. We find the &s;tudious animated with a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for the great virtues, as they are mi&s;takenly called, and utterly forgetful of the ordinary ones. The declama|tions of philo&s;ophy are generally rather exhau&s;ted on tho&s;e &s;upererogatory duties, than on &s;uch as are indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary. A man, therefore, who has taken his ideas of mankind from &s;tudy alone, generally comes into the world with an heart melting at fictitious di&s;tre&s;s. Thus he is in|duced, by mi&s;placed liberality, to put him&s;elf into the indi|gent circum&s;tances of the per&s;on he relieves.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this paper with the advice of one of the ancients to a young man whom he &s;aw giving away all his &s;ub&s;tance to pretended di&s;tre&s;s. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is po&s;&s;ible that the per|&s;on you relieve may be an hone&s;t man; and I know that you, who relieve him, are &s;uch.

genero&s;ity, that you rob a man, who is certainly de&s;erv|ing, to be&s;tow it on one who may po&s;&s;ibly be a rogue: and, while you are unju&s;t in rewarding uncertain merit, you are doubly guilty by &s;tripping your&s;elf."</Q></P>

<P>I &s;hall, therefore, throw out a few thoughts upon this &s;ubject, which, though known, have not been attended to by others; and &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s all attempts to plea&s;e, while I &s;tudy only in&s;truction.</P>
<P>The manner in which our youth of London are at pre&s;ent educated, is, &s;ome in free-&s;chools in the city, but the far greater number in boarding &s;chools about town. The parent ju&s;tly con&s;ults the health of his child, and finds an education in the country tends to promote this, much more than a con|tinuance in town. Thus far he is right; if there were a po&s;&s;ibility of having even our free-&s;chools kept a little out of town, it would certainly conduce to the health and vigour of, perhaps, the mind as well as the body. It may be thought whim&s;ical, but it is truth; I have found, by expe|rience, that they, who have &s;pent all their lives in cities, contract, not only an effeminacy of habit, but even of thinking.</P>
<P>But when I have &s;aid that the boarding-&s;chools are prefer|able to free-&s;chools, as being in the country, this is certainly the only advantage I can allow them: otherwi&s;e it is impo&s;|&s;ible to conceive the ignorance of tho&s;e who take upon them the important tru&s;t of education. Is any man unfit for any of the profe&s;&s;ions? he finds his la&s;t re&s;ource in &s;etting up a &s;chool. Do any become bankrupts in trade? they &s;till &s;et up a boarding-&s;chool, and drive a trade this way, when all others fail: nay, I have been told of butchers and barbers, who have turned &s;chool-ma&s;ters; and, more &s;urprizing &s;till, made fortunes in their new profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Could we think our&s;elves in a country of civilized people; could it be conceived that we have any regard for po&s;terity, when &s;uch are permitted to take the charge of the morals,
<PB N="41" REF="41">
genius, and health of tho&s;e dear little pledges, who may one day be the guardians of the liberties of Europe; and who may &s;erve as the honour and bulwark of their aged parents? The care of our children, is it below the &s;tate? Is it fit to indulge the caprice of the ignorant with the di&s;po&s;al of their children in this particular? For the &s;tate to take the charge of all its children, as in Per&s;ia or Sparta, might at pre&s;ent be inconve|nient; but &s;urely, with great ea&s;e, it might ca&s;t an eye to their in&s;tructors. Of all profe&s;&s;ions in &s;ociety, I do not know a more u&s;eful, or a more honourable one, than a &s;chool-ma&s;ter; at the &s;ame time that I do not &s;ee any more generally de&s;pi|&s;ed, or who&s;e talents are &s;o ill rewarded.</P>
<P>Were the &s;alaries of &s;chool-ma&s;ters to be augmented from a diminution of u&s;ele&s;s &s;inecures, how might it turn to the ad|vantage of this people! a people whom, without flattery, I may, in other re&s;pects, term the wi&s;e&s;t and greate&s;t upon earth. But while I would reward the de&s;erving, I would di&s;mi&s;s tho&s;e utterly unqualified for their employment: in &s;hort, I would make the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter every way more re&s;pectable, by increa&s;ing their &s;alaries, and admit|ting only men of proper abilities.</P>
<P>It is true, we have already &s;chool-ma&s;ters appointed, and they have &s;ome &s;mall &s;alaries; but where at pre&s;ent there is only one &s;chool-ma&s;ter appointed, there &s;hould at lea&s;t be two; and wherever the &s;alary is at pre&s;ent twenty pounds, it &s;hould be an hundred. Do we give immoderate benefices to tho&s;e who in&s;truct our&s;elves, and &s;hall we deny even &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to tho&s;e who in&s;truct our children? Every member of &s;ociety &s;hould be paid in proportion as he is nece&s;&s;ary; and I will be bold enough to &s;ay, that &s;chool-ma&s;ters in a &s;tate, are more nece&s;&s;ary than clergymen, as children &s;tand in more need of in&s;truction than their parents.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of this, as I have already ob&s;erved, we &s;end them to board in the country to the mo&s;t ignorant &s;et of men that can be imagined. But, le&s;t the ignorance of the ma&s;ter
<PB N="42" REF="42">
be not &s;ufficient, the child is generally con&s;igned to the u&s;her. This is commonly &s;ome poor needy animal, little &s;uperior to a footman either in learning or &s;pirit, invited to his place by an adverti&s;ement, and kept there merely from his being of a complying di&s;po&s;ition, and making the children fond of him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You give your child to be educated to a &s;lave,"</Q> &s;ays a phi|lo&s;opher to a rich man; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in&s;tead of one &s;lave, you will then have two."</Q></P>
<P>It were well, however, if parents, upon fixing their children in one of the&s;e hou&s;es, would examine the abilities of the u&s;h|er, as well as the ma&s;ter; for, whatever they are told to the contrary, the u&s;her is generally the per&s;on mo&s;t employed in their education. If then, a gentleman, upon putting out his &s;on to one of the&s;e hou&s;es, &s;ees the u&s;her di&s;regarded by the ma&s;ter, he may depend upon it, that he is equally di&s;regarded by the boys: the truth is, in &s;pite of all their endeavours to plea&s;e, they are generally the laughing-&s;tock of the &s;chool. Every trick is played upon the u&s;her; the oddity of his man|ners, his dre&s;s, or his language, are a fund of eternal ridicule; the ma&s;ter him&s;elf, now and then, cannot avoid joining in the laugh; and the poor wretch, eternally re&s;enting this ill u&s;age, &s;eems to live in a &s;tate of war with all the family. This is a very proper per&s;on, is it not, to give children a reli&s;h for learn|ing? They mu&s;t e&s;teem learning very much, when they &s;ee its profe&s;&s;ors u&s;ed with &s;uch little ceremony. If the u&s;her be de&s;pi&s;ed, the father may be a&s;&s;ured his child will never be pro|perly in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>But let me &s;uppo&s;e, that there are &s;ome &s;chools without the&s;e inconveniences, where the ma&s;ters and u&s;hers are men of learning, reputation, and a&s;&s;iduity. If there are to be found &s;uch, they cannot be prized in a &s;tate &s;ufficiently. A boy will learn more true wi&s;dom in a public &s;chool in a year, than by a private education in five. It is not from ma&s;ters, but from their equals, youth learn a knowledge of the world; the little tricks they play each other, the puni&s;hment that frequently
<PB N="43" REF="43">
attends the commi&s;&s;ion, is a ju&s;t picture of the great world; and all the ways of men are practi&s;ed in a public &s;chool in miniature. It is true, a child is early made acquainted with &s;ome vices in a &s;chool; but it is better to know the&s;e when a boy, than be fir&s;t taught them when a man; for their novelty then may have irre&s;i&s;tible charms.</P>
<P>In a public education, boys early learn temperance; and if the parents and friends would give them le&s;s money upon their u&s;ual vi&s;its, it would be much to their advantage; &s;ince it may ju&s;tly be &s;aid, that a great part of their di&s;orders ari&s;e from &s;urfeit, <HI>Plus occidit gula quam gladius.</HI> And now I am come to the article of health, it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that Mr. Locke, and &s;ome others, have advi&s;ed that children &s;hould be inured to cold, to fatigue, and hard&s;hip, from their youth; but Mr. Locke was but an indifferent phy&s;ician. Ha|bit, I grant, has great influence over our con&s;titutions, but we have not preci&s;e ideas upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>We know, that among &s;avages, and even among our pea|&s;ants, there are found children born with &s;uch con&s;titutions, that they cro&s;s rivers by &s;wimming, endure cold, thir&s;t, hun|ger, and want of &s;leep, to a &s;urpri&s;ing degree; that, when they happen to fall &s;ick, they are cured without the help of medi|cine, by nature alone. Such examples are adduced to per|&s;uade us to imitate their manner of education, and accu&s;tom our&s;elves betimes to &s;upport the &s;ame fatigues. But had the&s;e gentlemen con&s;idered fir&s;t, how many lives are lo&s;t in this a&s;|cetic practice; had they con&s;idered, that tho&s;e &s;avages and pea&s;ants are generally not &s;o long lived as they who have led a more indolent life; that the more laborious the life is, the le&s;s populous is the country: had they con&s;idered, that what phy&s;icians call the Stamina Vitae, by fatigue and labour be|come rigid, and thus anticipate old age: that the number who &s;urvive tho&s;e rude trials, bears no proportion to tho&s;e who die in the experiment. Had the&s;e things been properly con&s;ider|ed, they would not have thus extolled an education begun in
<PB N="44" REF="44">
fatigue and hard&s;hips. Peter the Great, willing to enure the children of his &s;eamen to a life of hard&s;hip, ordered that they &s;hould only drink &s;ea-water, but they unfortunately all died under the trial.</P>
<P>But while I would exclude all unnece&s;&s;ary labours, yet &s;till I would recommend temperance in the highe&s;t degree. No luxurious di&s;hes with high &s;ea&s;oning, nothing given children to force an appetite, as little &s;ugared or &s;alted provi&s;ions as po&s;|&s;ible, though ever &s;o plea&s;ing; but milk, morning and night, &s;hould be their con&s;tant food. This diet would make them more healthy than any of tho&s;e &s;lops that are u&s;ually cooked by the mi&s;tre&s;s of a boarding-&s;chool; be&s;ides, it corrects any con&s;umptive habits, not unfrequently found among&s;t the chil|dren of city parents.</P>
<P>As boys &s;hould be educated with temperance, &s;o the fir&s;t greate&s;t le&s;&s;on that &s;hould be taught them is, to admire fruga|lity. It is by the exerci&s;e of this virtue alone, they can e|ver expect to be u&s;eful members of &s;ociety. It is true, lectures continually repeated upon this &s;ubject, may make &s;ome boys, when they grow up, run into an extreme, and become mi&s;ers; but it were well, had we more mi&s;ers than we have among us. I know few characters more u&s;eful in &s;ociety; for a man's ha|ving a larger or &s;maller &s;hare of money lying u&s;ele&s;s by him, no way injures the commonwealth; &s;ince, &s;hould every mi&s;er now exhau&s;t his &s;tores, this might make gold more plenty, but it would not increa&s;e the commodities or plea&s;ures of life; they would &s;till remain as they are at pre&s;ent: it matters not, therefore, whether men are mi&s;ers or not, if they be only fru|gal, laborious, and fill the &s;tation they have cho&s;en. If they deny them&s;elves the nece&s;&s;aries of life, &s;ociety is no way inju|red by their folly.</P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of romances, which prai&s;e young men of &s;pirit, who go through a variety of adventures, and at la&s;t con|clude a life of di&s;&s;ipation, folly, and extravagance, in riches and matrimony, there &s;hould be &s;ome men of wit employed to
<PB N="45" REF="45">
compo&s;e books that might equally intere&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions of our youth, where &s;uch an one might be prai&s;ed for having re&s;i&s;ted allurements when young, and how he, at la&s;t, became lord|mayor; how he was married to a lady of great &s;en&s;e, fortune, and beauty: to be as explicit as po&s;&s;ible, the old &s;tory of Whittington, were his cat left out, might be more &s;erviceable to the tender mind, than either Tom Jones, Jo&s;eph Andrews, or an hundred others, where frugality is the only good quality the heroe is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. Were our &s;chool-ma&s;ters, if a|ny of them have &s;en&s;e enough to draw up &s;uch a work, thus employed, it would be much more &s;erviceable to their pupils, than all the grammars and dictionaries they may publi&s;h the&s;e ten years.</P>
<P>Children &s;hould early be in&s;tructed in the arts from which they may afterwards draw the greate&s;t advantages. When the wonders of nature are never expo&s;ed to our view, we have no great de&s;ire to become acquainted with tho&s;e parts of learning which pretend to account for the phaenomena. One of the ancients complains, that as &s;oon as young men have left &s;chool, and are obliged to conver&s;e in the world, they fan|cy them&s;elves tran&s;ported into a new region. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ut cum in forum venerint exi&s;timent &s;e in aliam terrarum orbem de|latos."</Q> We &s;hould early, therefore, in&s;truct them in the experiments, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, of knowledge, and leave to maturer age the accounting for the cau&s;es. But, in&s;tead of that, when boys begin natural philo&s;ophy in colleges, they have not the lea&s;t curio&s;ity for tho&s;e parts of the &s;cience which are propo&s;ed for their in&s;truction; they have never before &s;een the phaenomena, and con&s;equently have no curio&s;ity to learn the rea&s;ons. Might natural philo&s;ophy, therefore, be made their pa&s;time in &s;chool, by this means it would in college become their amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>In &s;everal of the machines now in u&s;e, there would be ample field both for in&s;truction and amu&s;ement; the different &s;orts of the pho&s;phorus, the artificial pyrites, magneti&s;m,
<PB N="46" REF="46">
electricity, the experiments upon the rarefaction and weight of the air, and tho&s;e upon ela&s;tic bodies, might employ their idle hours, and none &s;hould be called from play to &s;ee &s;uch experiments but &s;uch as thought proper. At fir&s;t then it would be &s;ufficient if the in&s;truments, and the effects of their combination, were only &s;hewn; the cau&s;es &s;hould be deffer|red to a maturer age, or to tho&s;e times when natural curio&s;ity prompts us to di&s;cover the wonders of nature. Man is plac|ed in this world as a &s;pectator; when he is tired of wondering at all the novelties about him, and not till then, does he de&s;ire to be made acquainted with the cau&s;es that create tho&s;e wonders.</P>
<P>What I have ob&s;erved with regard to natural philo&s;ophy, I would extend to every other &s;cience what&s;oever. We &s;hould teach them as many of the facts as were po&s;&s;ible, and defer the cau&s;es until they &s;eemed of them&s;elves de&s;irous of knowing them. A mind thus leaving &s;chool, &s;tored with all the &s;imple experiences of &s;cience, would be the fitte&s;t in the world for the college cour&s;e; and, though &s;uch a youth might not appear &s;o bright, or &s;o talkative, as tho&s;e who had learned the real principles and cau&s;es of &s;ome of the &s;ciences, yet he would make a wi&s;er man, and would retain a more la&s;ting pa&s;&s;ion for letters, than he who was early bur|dened with the di&s;agreeable in&s;titution of effect and cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In hi&s;tory, &s;uch &s;tories alone &s;hould be laid before them as might catch the imagination: in&s;tead of this, they are too frequently obliged to toil through the four empires, as they are called, where their memories are burdened by a number of di&s;gu&s;ting names, that de&s;troy all their future re|li&s;h for our be&s;t hi&s;torians, who may be termed the true&s;t teachers of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Every &s;pecies of flattery &s;hould be carefully avoided; a boy who happens to &s;ay a &s;prightly thing is generally applaud|ed &s;o much, that he &s;ometimes continues a coxcomb all his life after. He is reputed a wit at fourteen, and becomes a blockhead at twenty. Nur&s;es, footmen, and &s;uch, &s;hould
<PB N="47" REF="47">
therefore be driven away as much as po&s;&s;ible. I was even going to add, that the mother her&s;elf &s;hould &s;tifle her plea|&s;ure, or her vanity, when little ma&s;ter happens to &s;ay a good or a &s;mart thing. Tho&s;e mode&s;t lubberly boys, who &s;eem to want &s;pirit, generally go through their bu&s;ine&s;s with more ea&s;e to them&s;elves, and more &s;atisfaction to their in&s;tructors.</P>
<P>There has of late a gentleman appeared, who thinks the &s;tudy of rhetoric e&s;&s;ential to a perfect education. That bold male eloquence, which often, without plea&s;ing, convinces, is generally de&s;troyed by &s;uch in&s;titutions. Convincing elo|quence is infinitely more &s;erviceable to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or than the mo&s;t florid harangue or the mo&s;t pathetic tones that can be imagined; and the man who is thoroughly convinced him&s;elf, who under&s;tands his &s;ubject, and the language he &s;peaks in, will be more apt to &s;ilence oppo&s;ition, than he who &s;tudies the force of his periods, and fills our ears with &s;ounds, while our minds are de&s;titute of conviction.</P>
<P>It was reckoned the fault of the orators at the decline of the Roman empire, when they had been long in&s;tructed by rhetoricians, that their periods were &s;o harmonious, as that they could be &s;ung as well as &s;poken. What a ridiculous fi|gure mu&s;t one of the&s;e gentlemen cut, thus mea&s;uring &s;yl|lables, and weighing words, when he &s;hould plead the cau&s;e of his client! Two architects were once candidates for the building a certain temple at Athens; the fir&s;t harangued the croud very learnedly upon the different orders of archi|tecture, and &s;hewed them in what manner the temple &s;hould be built; the other, who got up after him, only ob&s;erved, that what his brother had &s;poken he could do; and thus he at once gained his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>To teach men to be orators, is little le&s;s than to teach them to be poets; and, for my part, I &s;hould have too great a regard for my child, to wi&s;h him a manor only in a book|&s;eller's &s;hop.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="48">
Another pa&s;&s;ion which the pre&s;ent age is apt to run into, is to make children learn all things; the languages, the &s;ciences, mu&s;ic, the exerci&s;es, and painting. Thus the child &s;oon becomes a Talker in all, but a Ma&s;ter in none. He thus acquires a &s;uperficial fondne&s;s for every thing, and only &s;hews his ignorance when he attempts to exhibit his &s;kill.</P>
<P>As I deliver my thoughts without method or connection, &s;o the reader mu&s;t not be &s;urprized to find me once more addre&s;&s;ing &s;chool-ma&s;ters on the pre&s;ent method of teaching the learned languages, which is commonly by literal tran&s;la|tions. I would a&s;k &s;uch, if they were to travel a journey, whether tho&s;e parts of the road in which they found the greate&s;t difficulties would not be longe&s;t remembered? Boys who, if I may continue the allu&s;ion, gallop through one of the ancients with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a tran&s;lation, can have but a very &s;light acquaintance either with the author or his language. It is by the exerci&s;e of the mind alone that a language is learned; but a literal tran&s;lation, on the oppo&s;ite page, leaves no exerci&s;e for the memory at all. The boy will not be at the fatigue of remembering, when his doubts are at once &s;atisfied by a glance of the eye; whereas, were every word to be &s;ought from a dictionary, the learner would attempt to remember them, to &s;ave him&s;elf the trouble of looking out for it for the future.</P>
<P>To continue in the &s;ame pedantic &s;train, of all the various grammars now taught in the &s;chools about town, I would re|commend only the old common one; I have forgot whether Lilly's, or an emendation of him. The others may be im|provements; but &s;uch improvements &s;eem, to me, only mere grammatical niceties, no way influencing the learner, but perhaps loading him with trifling &s;ubtilties, which, at a proper age, he mu&s;t be at &s;ome pains to forget.</P>
<P>Whatever pains a ma&s;ter may take to make the learning of the languages agreeable to his pupil, he may depend upon it,
<PB N="49" REF="49">
it, it will be at fir&s;t extremely unplea&s;ant. The rudiments of every language, therefore, mu&s;t be given as a ta&s;k, not as an amu&s;ement. Attempting to deceive children into in|&s;truction of this kind, is only deceiving our&s;elves; and I know no pa&s;&s;ion capable of conquering a child's natural lazi|ne&s;s, but fear. Solomon has &s;aid it before me; nor is there any more certain, though perhaps more di&s;agreeable truth, than the proverb in ver&s;e, too well known to repeat on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. It is very probable that parents are told of &s;ome ma&s;ters who never u&s;e the rod, and con&s;equently are thought the propere&s;t in&s;tructors for their children; but, though ten|derne&s;s is a requi&s;ite quality in an in&s;tructor, yet there is too often the true&s;t tenderne&s;s in well-timed correction.</P>
<P>Some have ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that all pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould be ba|ni&s;hed on this terrible occa&s;ion; but I know not how, there is a frailty attending human nature, that few ma&s;ters can keep their temper while they correct. I knew a good-natured man, who was &s;en&s;ible of his own weakne&s;s in this re&s;pect, and con&s;equently had recour&s;e to the following expedient to pre|vent his pa&s;&s;ions from being engaged, yet at the &s;ame time admini&s;ter ju&s;tice with impartiality. Whenever any of his pupils committed a fault, he &s;ummoned a jury of his peers, I mean of the boys of his own or the next cla&s;&s;es to him: his accu&s;ers &s;tood forth; he had liberty of pleading in his own defence, and one or two more had the liberty of plead|ing again&s;t him: when found guilty by the pannel, he was con&s;igned to the footman, who attended in the hou&s;e, and had previous orders to puni&s;h, but with lenity. By this means the ma&s;ter took off the odium of puni&s;hment from him&s;elf; and the footman, between whom and the boys there could not be even the &s;lighe&s;t intimacy, was placed in &s;uch a light as to be &s;hunned by every boy in the &s;chool.</P>

<P>AN alehou&s;e-keeper, near I&s;lington, who had long lived at the &s;ign of the French King, upon the commencement of the la&s;t war with France, pulled down his old &s;ign, and put up that of the queen of Hungary.

<P>As Alexander VI. was entering a little town in the neigh|bourhood of Rome, which had been ju&s;t evacuated by the enemy, he perceived the town&s;men bu&s;y in the market-place in pulling down from a gibbet a figure which had been de|&s;igned to repre&s;ent him&s;elf.

It is po&s;&s;ible that a man who knew le&s;s of the world, would have condemned the adulation of tho&s;e bare|faced flatterers; but Alexander &s;eemed plea&s;ed at their zeal, and turning to Borgia, his &s;on, &s;aid with a &s;mile, <HI>Vides, mi fili, quam leve di&s;crim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> palibulum inter et &s;tatuum.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You &s;ee, my &s;on, the &s;mall difference between a gibbet and a &s;tatue."</Q> If the great could be taught any le&s;&s;on, this might &s;erve to teach them upon how weak a foundation their glory &s;tands, which is built upon popular applau&s;e; for, as &s;uch prai&s;e what &s;eems like merit, they as quickly condemn what has only the appearance of guilt.</P>

A Chine&s;e, who had long &s;tudied the works of Confucius, who knew the characters of fourteen thou&s;and words, and could read a great part of every book that came in his way, once took it into his head to travel into Europe, and ob&s;erve the cu&s;toms of a people whom he thought not very much inferior, even to his own countrymen, in the arts of refin|ing upon every plea&s;ure. Upon his arrival at Am&s;terdam, his pa&s;&s;ion for letters naturally led him to a book&s;eller's &s;hop; and, as he could &s;peak a little Dutch, he civilly a&s;ked the book&s;eller for the works of the immortal Xixofou.

<P>MY hone&s;t friends and brother politicians; I perceive that the intended war with Spain makes many of you unea&s;y.

You mu&s;t mend broken bellows, and I write bad pro&s;e, as long as we live, whether we like a Spani&s;h war or not. Believe me, my hone&s;t friends, whatever you may talk of liberty and your own rea&s;on, both that liberty and rea&s;on are conditionally re|&s;igned by every poor man in every &s;ociety; and, as we are born to work, &s;o others are born to watch over us while we are working.

Attracted by the &s;erenity of the evening, a friend and I lately went to gaze upon the company in one of the public walks near the city.

His hat was pinched up with peculiar &s;martne&s;s; his looks were pale, thin, and &s;harp; round his neck he wore a broad black rib|bon, and in his bo&s;om a buckle &s;tudded with gla&s;s; his coat was trimmed with tarni&s;hed twi&s;t; he wore by his &s;ide a &s;word with a black hilt; and his &s;tockings of &s;ilk, though newly wa&s;hed, were grown yellow by long &s;ervice.

<P>As I knew him to be an harmle&s;s amu&s;ing little thing, I could not return his &s;miles with any degree of &s;everity; &s;o we walked forward on terms of the utmo&s;t intimacy, and in a few minutes di&s;cu&s;&s;ed all the u&s;ual topics preliminary to parti|cular conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The oddities that marked his character, however, &s;oon be|gan to appear; he bowed to &s;everal well-dre&s;&s;ed per&s;ons, who, by their manner of returning the compliment, appeared per|fect &s;trangers. At intervals he drew out a pocket-book, &s;eem|ing to take memorandums before all the company with much importance and a&s;&s;iduity. In this manner he led me through the length of the whole Mall, fretting at his ab&s;urdities, and fancying my&s;elf laughed at, as well as he, by every &s;pectator.</P>
<P>When we were got to the end of our proce&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Bla&s;t me,"</Q> cries he, with an air of vivacity, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I never &s;aw the Park &s;o thin in my life before; there's no company at all to-day.

<P>We entered the lower door, which &s;eemed ever to lie mo&s;t ho&s;pitably open; and I began to a&s;cend an old and creaking &s;tair-ca&s;e; when, as he mounted to &s;hew me the way, he de|manded, whether I delighted in pro&s;pects; to which an&s;wer|ing in the affirmative, <Q REND="inline">"Then,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;hall &s;hew you one of the mo&s;t charming out of my windows; we &s;hall &s;ee the &s;hips &s;ailing, and the whole country for twenty miles round, tip top, quite high.

<P>As it has been ob&s;erved that few are better qualified to give others advice, than tho&s;e who have taken the lea&s;t of it them&s;elves; &s;o in this re&s;pect I find my&s;elf perfectly au|thori&s;ed to offer mine; and mu&s;t take leave to throw toge|ther a few ob&s;ervations upon that part of a young man's con|duct on his entering into life, as it is called.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t u&s;ual way among young men who have no re&s;olu|tion of their own, is fir&s;t to a&s;k one friend's advice, and fol|it for &s;ome time; then to a&s;k advice of another, and turn to that; &s;o of a third, &s;till un&s;teady, always changing. How|ever, every change of this nature is for the wor&s;e; people may tell you of your being unfit for &s;ome peculiar occupa|tions in life; but heed them not; whatever employment you follow with per&s;everance and a&s;&s;iduity, will be found fit for you; it will be your &s;upport in youth and comfort in age. In learning the u&s;eful part of every profe&s;&s;ion very moderate abilities will &s;uffice: great abilities are generally obnoxious to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Life has been compared to a race; but the allu&s;ion &s;till improves, by ob&s;erving, that the mo&s;t &s;wift are ever the mo&s;t apt to &s;tray from the cour&s;e.</P>
<P>To know one profe&s;&s;ion only, is enough for one man to know; and this, whatever the profe&s;&s;ors may tell you to the contrary, is &s;oon learned. Be contented, therefore, with one good employment; for if you under&s;tand two at a time, people will give you bu&s;ine&s;s in neither.</P>
<P>A conjurer and a taylor once happened to conver&s;e toge|ther. <Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> cries the taylor, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what an unhappy poor poor creature am I! if people ever take it into their heads to live without cloaths, I am undone; I have no other trade to have recour&s;e to."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, friend, I pity you

&s;incerely,"</Q> replies the conjurer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but, thank heaven, things are not quite &s;o bad with me: for, if one trick &s;hould fail, I have an hundred tricks for them yet. How|ever, if at any time you are reduced to beggary, apply to me, and I will relieve you."</Q> A famine over&s;pread the land; the taylor made a &s;hift to live, becau&s;e his cu&s;tomers could not be without cloaths; but the poor conjurer, with all his hundred tricks, could find none that had money to throw away: it was in vain that he promi&s;ed to eat fire, or to vomit pins; no &s;ingle creature would relieve him, till he was at la&s;t obliged to beg from the very taylor who&s;e calling he had formerly de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>There are no ob&s;tructions more fatal to fortune than pride and re&s;entment. If you mu&s;t re&s;ent injuries at all, at lea&s;t &s;uppre&s;s your indignation till you become rich; and then &s;hew away. The re&s;entment of a poor man is like the efforts of harmle&s;s in&s;ect to &s;ting; it may get him cru&s;hed, but cannot defend him. Who values that anger which is con&s;umed only in empty menaces?</P>
<P>Once upon a time a goo&s;e fed its young by a pond-&s;ide; and a goo&s;e, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, is always extremely proud, and exce&s;&s;ively punctilious. If any other animal, without the lea&s;t de&s;ign to offend, happened to pa&s;s that way, the goo&s;e was immediately at it. The pond, &s;he &s;aid, was hers, and &s;he would maintain her right in it, and &s;up|port her honour, while &s;he had a bill to hi&s;s, or a wing to flutter. In this manner &s;he drove away ducks, pigs, and chickens; nay, even the in&s;idious cat was &s;een to &s;camper. A lounging ma&s;tiff, however, happened to pa&s;s by, and thought it no harm if he &s;hould lap a little of the water, as he was thir&s;ty. The guardian goo&s;e flew at him like a fury, pecked at him with her beak, and &s;lapped him with her fea|thers. The dog grew angry, and had twenty times a mind to give her a &s;ly &s;nap; but &s;uppre&s;&s;ing his indignation, be|cau&s;e his ma&s;ter was nigh, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A pox take thee,"</Q> cries he,
<PB N="67" REF="67">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for a fool, &s;ure tho&s;e who have neither &s;trength nor wea|pons to fight, at lea&s;t &s;hould be civil."</Q> So &s;aying, he went forward to the pond, quenched his thir&s;t, in &s;pite of the goo&s;e, and followed his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Another ob&s;truction to the fortune of youth is, that, while they are willing to take offence from none, they are al&s;o e|qually de&s;irous of giving nobody offence. From hence they endeavour to plea&s;e all, comply with every reque&s;t, and at|tempt to &s;uit them&s;elves to every company; have no will of their own; but, like wax, catch every contiguous impre&s;|&s;ion. By thus attempting to give univer&s;al &s;atisfaction, they at la&s;t find them&s;elves mi&s;erably di&s;appointed; to bring the generality of admirers on our &s;ide, it is &s;ufficient to attempt plea&s;ing a very few.</P>
<P>A painter of eminence was once re&s;olved to fini&s;h a piece which &s;hould plea&s;e the whole world. When, therefore, he had drawn a picture, in which his utmo&s;t &s;kill was ex|hau&s;ted, it was expo&s;ed in the public market-place, with di|rections at the bottom for every &s;pectator to mark with a bru&s;h, that lay by, every limb and feature which &s;eemed er|roneous. The &s;pectators came, and, in general, applauded; but each willing to &s;hew his talent at critici&s;m, &s;tigmatized whatever he thought proper. At evening, when the paint|er came, he was mortified to find the picture one univer&s;al blot; not a &s;ingle &s;troke that had not the marks of di&s;ap|probation. Not &s;atisfied with this trial, the next day he was re&s;olved to try them in a different manner; and expo&s;ing his picture as before, de&s;ired that every &s;pectator would mark tho&s;e beauties he approved or admired. The people complied, and the arti&s;t returning, found his picture covered with the marks of beauty; every &s;troke that had been ye&s;terday condemned, now received the character of approbation. <Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> cries the painter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I now find the be&s;t way to plea&s;e all the world, is to attempt plea&s;ing one half of it."</Q></P>

<P>INDULGENT nature &s;eems to have exempted this i&s;land from many of tho&s;e epidemic evils which are &s;o fatal in other parts of the world. A want of rain for a few days beyond the expected &s;ea&s;on, in &s;ome parts of the globe, &s;preads famine, de&s;olation, and terror, over the whole country; but, in this fortunate land of Britain, the inhabitant courts health in every breeze, and the hu&s;bandman ever &s;ows in joyful expectation.</P>
<P>But, though the nation be exempt from real evils, it is not more happy on this account than others. The people are afflicted, it is true, with neither famine nor pe&s;tilence; but then there is a di&s;order peculiar to the country, which every &s;ea&s;on makes &s;trange ravages among them; it &s;preads with pe&s;tilential rapidity, and infects almo&s;t every rank of people; what is &s;till more &s;trange, the natives have no name for this peculiar malady, though well known to foreign phy&s;icians by the appellation of Epidemic Terror.</P>
<P>A &s;ea&s;on is never known to pa&s;s, in which the people are not vi&s;ited by this cruel calamity, in one &s;hape or another, &s;eemingly different, though ever the &s;ame; one year it i&s;|&s;ues from a baker's &s;hop in the &s;hape of a &s;ixpenny loaf, the next it takes the appearance of a comet with a fiery trial, the third it threatens like a flat-bottomed boat, and the fourth it carries con&s;ternation in the bite of a mad dog. The people, when once infected, lo&s;e their reli&s;h for happine&s;s, &s;aunter about with looks of de&s;pondence, a&s;k after the calamities of the day, and receive no comfort but in heightening each o|ther's di&s;tre&s;s. It is in&s;ignificant how remote or near, how weak or powerful, the object of terror may be, when once they re&s;olve to fright and be frighted; the mere&s;t trifles &s;ow
<PB N="69" REF="69">
con&s;ternation and di&s;may; each proportions his fears, not to the object, but to the dread he di&s;covers in the countenance of others; for, when once the fermentation is begun, it goes on of it&s;elf, though the original cau&s;e be di&s;continued which fir&s;t &s;et it in motion.</P>
<P>A dread of mad dogs is the epidemic terror which now prevails, and the whole nation is at pre&s;ent actually groaning under the malignity of its influence. The people fally from their hou&s;es with that circum&s;pection which is prudent in &s;uch as expect a mad dog at every turning. The phy&s;ician pub|li&s;hes his pre&s;cription, the beadle prepares his halter, and a few of unu&s;ual bravery arm them&s;elves with boots and buff gloves, in order to face the enemy, if he &s;hould offer to at|tack them. In &s;hort, the whole people &s;tand upon their de|fence, and &s;eem, by their pre&s;ent &s;pirit, to &s;hew a re&s;olution of being tamely bit by mad dogs no longer.</P>
<P>Their manner of knowing whether a dog be mad or no, &s;omewhat re&s;embles the ancient Gothic cu&s;tom of trying witches. The old woman &s;u&s;pected was tied hand and foot, and thrown into the water. If &s;he &s;wam, then &s;he was in|&s;tantly carried off to be burnt for a witch; if &s;he &s;unk, then indeed &s;he was acquitted of the charge, but drowned in the experiment. In the &s;ame manner a croud gather round a dog &s;u&s;pected of madne&s;s, and they begin by teizing the devoted animal on every &s;ide. If he attempts to &s;tand upon the de|fen&s;ive, and bite, then he is unanimou&s;ly found guilty, for <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A mad dog always &s;naps at every thing."</Q> If, on the con|trary, he &s;trives to e&s;cape by running away, then he can ex|pect no compa&s;&s;ion, for <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mad dogs always run &s;traight for|ward before them."</Q></P>
<P>It is plea&s;ant enough for a neutral being like me, who have no &s;hare in tho&s;e ideal calamities, to mark the &s;tages of this national di&s;ea&s;e. The terror at fir&s;t feebly enters with a di&s;regarded &s;tory of a little dog, that had gone through a neigh|bouring village, which was thought to be mad by &s;everal who
<PB N="70" REF="70">
had &s;een him. The next account comes, that a ma&s;tiff ran through a certain town, and had bit five gee&s;e, which immedi|ately ran mad, foamed at the bill, and died in great agonies &s;oon after. Then comes an affecting hi&s;tory of a little boy bit in the leg, and gone down to be dipped in the &s;alt water. When the people have &s;ufficiently &s;huddered at that, they are next congealed with a frightful account of a man who was &s;aid lately to have died from a bite he had received &s;ome years be|fore. This relation only prepares the way for another, &s;till more hideous; as how the ma&s;ter of a family, with &s;even &s;mall children, were all bit by a mad lap-dog; and how the poor father fir&s;t perceived the infection by calling for a draught of water, where he &s;aw the lap-dog &s;wimming in the cup.</P>
<P>When epidemic terror is thus once excited, every morning comes loaded with &s;ome new di&s;a&s;ter; as in &s;tories of gho&s;ts each loves to hear the account, though it only &s;erves to make him unea&s;y; &s;o here each li&s;tens with eagerne&s;s, and adds to the tidings with new circum&s;tances of peculiar horror. A lady, for in&s;tance, in the country, of very weak nerves, has been frightened by the barking of a dog; and this, alas! too frequently happens. The &s;tory &s;oon is improved, and &s;preads, that a mad dog had frighted a lady of di&s;tinction. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances begin to grow terrible before they have reached the neighbouring village; and there the report is, that a lady of quality was bit by a mad ma&s;tiff. This account every mo|ment gathers new &s;trength, and grows more di&s;mal as it ap|proaches the capital; and, by the time it has arrived in town, the lady is de&s;cribed with wild eyes, foaming mouth, running mad upon all four, barking like a dog, biting her &s;ervants, and at la&s;t &s;mothered between two beds by the advice of her doctors; while the mad ma&s;tiff is, in the mean time, ranging the whole country over, &s;lavering at the mouth, and &s;eeking whom he may devour.</P>
<P>My landlady, a good-natured woman, but a little credulous, waked me &s;ome mornings ago, before the u&s;ual hour, with
<PB N="71" REF="71">
horror and a&s;toni&s;hment in her looks. She de&s;ired me, if I had any regard for my &s;afety, to keep within; for a few days ago, &s;o di&s;mal an accident had happened, as to put all the world upon their guard. A mad dog, down in the country, &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, had bit a farmer, who &s;oon becom|ing mad, ran into his own yard, and bit a fine brindled cow; the cow quickly became as mad as the man, began to foam at the mouth, and rai&s;ing her&s;elf up, walked about on her hind legs, &s;ometimes barking like a dog, and &s;ometimes attempting to talk like the farmer. Upon examining the grounds of this &s;tory, I found my landlady had it from one neighbour, who had it from another neighbour, who heard it from very good authority.</P>
<P>Were mo&s;t &s;tories of this nature well examined, it would be found that numbers of &s;uch as have been &s;aid to &s;uffer were no way injured, and that of tho&s;e who have been actually bit|ten, not one in a hundred was bit by a mad dog. Such ac|counts in general, therefore, only &s;erve to make the people mi&s;erable by fal&s;e terrors, and &s;ometimes fright the patient in|to actual frenzy, by creating tho&s;e very &s;ymptoms they pre|tended to deplore.</P>
<P>But even allowing three or four to die in a &s;ea&s;on of this ter|rible death (and four is probable too large a conce&s;&s;ion) yet &s;till it is not con&s;idered, how many are pre&s;erved in their health and in their property by this devoted animal's &s;ervices. The midnight robber is kept at a di&s;tance; the in&s;idious thief is often detected; the healthful chace repairs many a worn con|&s;titution; and the poor man finds in his dog a willing a&s;&s;i&s;tant, eager to le&s;&s;en his toil, and content with the &s;malle&s;t retri|bution.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A dog,"</Q> &s;ays one of the Engli&s;h poets, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is an hone&s;t creature, and I am a friend to dogs."</Q> Of all the bea&s;ts that graze the lawn, or hunt the fore&s;t, a dog is the only animal, that, leaving his fellows, attempts to cultivate the friend&s;hip of man; to man he looks, in all his nece&s;&s;ities, with a &s;peaking

eye for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; exerts, for him, all the little &s;ervice in his power with chearfulne&s;s and plea&s;ure; for him bears famine and fatigue with patience and re&s;ignation; no injuries can a|bate his fidelity; no di&s;tre&s;s induce him to for&s;ake his bene|factor; &s;tudious to plea&s;e, and fearing to offend, he is &s;till an humble, &s;tedfa&s;t dependant; and in him alone fawn|ing is not flattery.

<P>AGE, that le&s;&s;ens the enjoyment of life, encrea&s;es our de|&s;ire of living. Tho&s;e dangers which, in the vigour of youth, we had learned to de&s;pi&s;e, a&s;&s;ume new terrors as we grow old. Our caution encrea&s;ing as our years encrea&s;e, fear becomes at at la&s;t the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion of the mind; and the &s;mall remain|der of life is taken up in u&s;ele&s;s efforts to keep off our end, or provide for a continued exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Strange contradiction in our nature, and to which even the wi&s;e are liable! If I &s;hould judge of that part of life which lies before me by that which I have already &s;een, the pro&s;pect is hideous. Experience tells me, that my pa&s;t enjoyments have brought no real felicity; and &s;en&s;ation a&s;&s;ures me, that tho&s;e I have felt are &s;tronger than tho&s;e which are yet to come. Yet experience and &s;en&s;ation in vain per&s;uade; hope, more powerful than either, dre&s;&s;es out the di&s;tant pro&s;pect in fancied beauty; &s;ome happine&s;s, in long per&s;pective, &s;till beckons me to pur&s;ue; and, like a lo&s;ing game&s;ter, every new di&s;appoint|pointment encrea&s;es my ardour to continue the game.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="73">
Whence then is this encrea&s;ed love of life, which grows upon us with our years? whence comes it, that we thus make great efforts to pre&s;erve our exi&s;tence, at a period when it becomes &s;carce worth the keeping? Is it that nature, attentive to the pre&s;ervation of mankind, encrea&s;es our wi&s;hes to live, while &s;he le&s;&s;ens our enjoyments; and, as &s;he robs the &s;en&s;es of every plea&s;ure, equips imagination in the &s;poil? Life would be in&s;upportable to an old man, who, loaded with infirmities, feared death no more than when in the vigour of manhood; the numberle&s;s calamities of decaying nature, and the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of &s;urviving every plea&s;ure, would at once induce him, with his own hand, to terminate the &s;cene of mi&s;ery; but hap|pily the contempt of death for&s;akes him at a time when it could only be prejudicial; and life acquires an imaginary value, in proportion as its real value is no more.</P>
<P>Our attachment to every object around us encrea&s;es, in ge|neral, from the length of our acquaintance with it. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I would not choo&s;e,"</Q> &s;ays a French philo&s;opher, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to &s;ee an old po&s;t pulled up with which I had been long acquainted."</Q> A mind long habituated to a certain &s;et of objects, in&s;en&s;ibly becomes fond of &s;eeing them; vi&s;its them from habit, and parts from them with reluctance: from hence proceeds the avarice of the old in every kind of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; they love the world and all it produces; they love life and all its advanta|ges; not becau&s;e it gives them plea&s;ure, but becau&s;e they have known it long.</P>
<P>Chinvang the Cha&s;te, a&s;cending the throne of China, com|manded that all who were unju&s;tly detained in pri&s;on, during the preceding reigns, &s;hould be &s;et free. Among the number who came to thank their deliverer on this occa&s;ion, there ap|peared a maje&s;tic old man, who, falling at the emperor's feet, addre&s;&s;ed him as follows: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Great father of China, behold a wretch, now eighty-five years old, who was &s;hut up in a dungeon at the age of twenty-two. I was impri&s;on|ed, though a &s;tranger to crime, or without being even confronted
<PB N="74" REF="74">
by my accu&s;ers. I have now lived in &s;olitude and darkne&s;s for more than fifty years, and I am grown familiar with di&s;tre&s;s. As yet dazzled with the &s;plendor of that &s;un to which you have re&s;tored me, I have been wandering the &s;treets to find out &s;ome friend that would a&s;&s;i&s;t, or relieve, or remember me; but my friends, my family, and rela|tions, are all dead, and I am forgotten. Permit me then, O Chinvang, to wear out the wretched remains of life in my former pri&s;on; the walls of my dungeon are to me more plea&s;ing than the mo&s;t &s;plendid palace: I have not long to live, and &s;hall be unhappy except I &s;pend the re&s;t of my days where my youth was pa&s;&s;ed; in that pri&s;on from whence you were plea&s;ed to relea&s;e me."</Q></P>
<P>The old man's pa&s;&s;ion for confinement is &s;imilar to that we all have for life. We are habituated to the pri&s;on, we look round with di&s;content, are di&s;plea&s;ed with the abode, and yet the length of our captivity only encrea&s;es our fondne&s;s for the cell. The trees we have planted, the hou&s;es we have built, or the po&s;terity we have begotten, all &s;erve to bind us clo&s;er to earth, and embitter our parting. Life &s;ues the young like a new acquaintance; the companion, as yet unexhau&s;ted, is at once in&s;tructive and amu&s;ing; its company plea&s;es; yet, for all this, it is but little regarded. To us, who are declined in years, life appears like an old friend; its je&s;ts have been an|ticipated in former conver&s;ation; it has no new &s;tory to make us &s;mile, no new improvement with which to &s;urpri&s;e; yet &s;till we love it: de&s;titute of every enjoyment, &s;till we love it; hu&s;band the wa&s;ting trea&s;ure with encrea&s;ing frugality, and feel all the poignancy of angui&s;h in the fatal &s;eparation.</P>
<P>Sir Philip Mordaunt was young, beautiful, &s;incere, brave, an Engli&s;hman. He had a complete fortune of his own, and the love of the king his ma&s;ter, which was equivalent to riches. Life opened all her trea&s;ures before him, and pro|mi&s;ed a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of future happine&s;s. He came, ta&s;ted of the entertainment, but was di&s;gu&s;ted even at the beginning.
<PB N="75" REF="75">
He profe&s;&s;ed an aver&s;ion to living; was tired of walking round the &s;ame circle; had tried every enjoyment, and found them all grow weaker at every repetition. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If life be, in youth, &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing,"</Q> cried he to him&s;elf, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what will it appear when age comes on? if it be at pre&s;ent indifferent, &s;ure it will then be execrable."</Q> This thought embittered every reflection; till, at la&s;t, with all the &s;erenity of perverted rea|&s;on, he ended the debate with a pi&s;tol! Had this &s;elf-deluded man been appri&s;ed, that exi&s;tence grows more de&s;irable to us the longer we exi&s;t, he would have then faced old age with|out &s;hrinking; he would have boldly dared to live; and &s;er|ved that &s;ociety, by his future a&s;&s;iduity, which he ba&s;ely in|jured by his de&s;ertion.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XV.</HEAD>
<P>FOREIGNERS ob&s;erve, that there are no ladies in the world more beautiful, or more ill dre&s;&s;ed, than tho&s;e of Eng|land. Our country-women, have been compared to tho&s;e pictures, where the face is the work of a Raphael; but the dra|peries thrown out by &s;ome empty pretender, de&s;titute of ta&s;te, and entirely unacquainted with de&s;ign.</P>
<P>If I were a poet, I might ob&s;erve, on this occa&s;ion, that &s;o much beauty, &s;et off with all the advantages of dre&s;s, would be too powerful an antagoni&s;t for the oppo&s;ite &s;ex; and therefore it was wi&s;ely ordered that our ladies &s;hould want ta&s;te, le&s;t their admirers &s;hould entirely want rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But to confe&s;s a truth, I do not find they have a greater a|ver&s;ion to fine cloaths than the women of any other country what&s;oever. I can't fancy that a &s;hop-keeper's wife in Cheap|&s;ide has a greater tenderne&s;s for the fortune of her hu&s;band
<PB N="76" REF="76">
than a citizen's wife in Paris; or that mi&s;s in a boarding-&s;chool is more an oeconomi&s;t in dre&s;s than mademoi&s;elle in a nunnery.</P>
<P>Although Paris may be accounted the &s;oil in which almo&s;t every fa&s;hion takes its ri&s;e, its influence is never &s;o general there as with us. They &s;tudy there the happy method of u|niting grace and fa&s;hion, and never excu&s;e a woman for being aukwardly dre&s;&s;ed, by &s;aying, her cloaths are in the mode. A French woman is a perfect architect in dre&s;s; &s;he never, with Gothic ignorance, mixes the orders; &s;he never tricks out a &s;quabby Doric &s;hape with Corinthian finery; or, to &s;peak without metaphor, &s;he conforms to general fa&s;hion only when it happens not to be repugnant to private beauty. The Engli&s;h ladies, on the contrary, &s;eem to have no other &s;tandard of grace but the run of the town. If fa&s;hion gives the word, every di&s;tinction of beauty, complexion, or &s;tature, cea&s;es. Sweeping trains, Pru&s;&s;ian bonnets, and trollopees, as like each other as if cut from the &s;ame piece, level all to one &s;tandard. The Mall, the gardens and playhou&s;es, are filled with ladies in uniform; and their whole appearance &s;hews as little variety of ta&s;te as if their cloaths were be&s;poke by the colonel of a marching regiment, or fancied by the arti&s;t who dre&s;&s;es the three battalions of guards.</P>
<P>But not only the ladies of every &s;hape and complexion, but of every age too, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this unaccountable pa&s;&s;ion for levelling all di&s;tinction in dre&s;s. The lady of no quality travels fa&s;t behind the lady of &s;ome quality; and a woman of &s;ixty is as gaudy as her grand-daughter. A friend of mine, a good-natured old man, amu&s;ed me, the other day, with an account of his journey to the Mall. It &s;eems in his walk thi|ther, he, for &s;ome time, followed a lady, who, as he thought by her dre&s;s, was a girl of fifteen. It was airy, elegant, and youthful. My old friend had called up all his poetry on this occa&s;ion, and fancied twenty cupids prepared for execution in every folding of her white negligee. He had prepared his imagination for an angel's face; but what was his mortification
<PB N="77" REF="77">
to find that the imaginary godde&s;s was no other than his cou&s;in Hannah, &s;ome years older than him&s;elf!</P>

<Q REND="inline">"After the tran&s;ports of our fir&s;t &s;alute,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"were over, I could not avoid run|ning my eye over her whole appearance. Her gown was of cambric, cut &s;hort before, in order to di&s;cover an high-heeled &s;hoe, which was buckled almo&s;t at the toe. Her cap con&s;i&s;ted of a few bits of cambric, and flowers of painted paper &s;tuck on one &s;ide of her head. Her bo&s;om, that had felt no hand but the hand of time the&s;e twenty years, ro&s;e, &s;uing to be pre&s;&s;ed.

<P><Q REND="inline">"As my cou&s;in had not put on all this finery for nothing, &s;he was at that time &s;allying out to the Park, when I had over|taken her.

Though I trembled for our reception in public, yet I could not with any civility refu&s;e; &s;o, to be as gallant as po&s;|&s;ible, I took her hand in my arm, and thus we marched on together."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When we made our entry at the Park, two antiquated figures, &s;o polite and &s;o tender, &s;oon attracted the eyes of the company.

The polite could not forbear &s;miling, and the vulgar bur&s;t out into a hor&s;e-laugh at our grote&s;que figures. Cou&s;in Hannah, who was perfectly con&s;cious of the rectitude of her own appearance, attributed all this mirth to the oddity of mine; while I as cor|dially placed the whole to her account. Thus, from being two of the be&s;t-natured creatures alive, before we got half up the Mall, we began to grow peevi&s;h, and, like two mice in a &s;tring,

<P><Q REND="inline">"As my cou&s;in, by this time, was grown heartily a&s;hamed of her gentleman-u&s;her, and as I was never very fond of any kind of exhibition my&s;elf, it was mutually agreed to retire for a while to one of the &s;eats, and from that retreat remark on others, as freely as they had remarked on us.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When &s;eated we continued &s;ilent for &s;ome time, employed in very different &s;peculations.

<HEAD>ESSAY XVI.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE Tauris lifts its head above the &s;torm, and pre|&s;ents nothing to the &s;ight of the di&s;tant traveller, but a pro&s;|pect of nodding rocks, falling torrents, and all the variety of tremendous nature; on the bleak bo&s;om of this frightful mountain, &s;ecluded from &s;ociety, and dete&s;ting the ways of men, lived A&s;em the Manhater.</P>
<P>A&s;em had &s;pent his youth with men; had &s;hared in their amu&s;ements; and had been taught to love his fellow-crea|tures with the mo&s;t ardent affection: but, from the tender|ne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, he exhau&s;ted all his fortune in reliev|ing the wants of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. The petitioner never &s;ued
<PB N="81" REF="81">
in vain; the weary traveller never pa&s;&s;ed his door; he only de&s;i&s;ted from doing good when he had no longer the power of relieving.</P>
<P>From a fortune thus &s;pent in benevolence, he expected a grateful return from tho&s;e he had formerly relieved; and made his application with confidence of redre&s;s: the ungrateful world &s;oon grew weary of his importunity; for pity is but a &s;hort-lived pa&s;&s;ion. He &s;oon, therefore, began to view mankind in a very different light from that in which he had before beheld them: he perceived a thou&s;and vices he had ne|ver before &s;u&s;pected to exi&s;t: wherever he turned, ingrati|tude, di&s;&s;imulation, and treachery, contributed to increa&s;e his dete&s;tation of them. Re&s;olved therefore to continue no longer in a world which he hated, and which repaid his dete&s;|tation with contempt, he retired to this region of &s;terility, in order to brood over his re&s;entment in &s;olitude, and con|ver&s;e with the only hone&s;t heart he knew; namely, with his own.</P>
<P>A cave was his only &s;helter from the inclemency of the weather; fruits, gathered with difficulty from the moun|tain's &s;ide, his only food; and his drink was fetched with danger and toil from the headlong torrent. In this manner he lived, &s;eque&s;tered from &s;ociety, pa&s;&s;ing the hours in medi|tation, and &s;ometimes exulting that he was able to live inde|pendently of his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>At the foot of the mountain, an exten&s;ive lake di&s;played its gla&s;&s;y bo&s;om; reflecting, on its broad &s;urface, the impend|ing horrors of the mountain. To this capacious mirror he would &s;ometimes de&s;cend, and, reclining on its &s;teep banks, ca&s;t an eager look on the &s;mooth expan&s;e that lay before him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How beautiful,"</Q> he often cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is nature! how lovely, even in her wilde&s;t &s;cenes!

Tempe&s;ts and whirlwinds have their u&s;e; but vicious ungrateful man is a blot in the fair page of univer&s;al beauty. Why was I born of that dete&s;ted &s;pecies, who&s;e vices are almo&s;t a reproach to the wi&s;dom of the divine Creator! Were men entirely free from vice, all would be uniformity, harmony, and order. A world of moral rectitude, &s;hould be the re&s;ult of a per|fectly moral agent. Why, why then, O Alla! mu&s;t I be thus confined in darkne&s;s, doubt, and de&s;pair!"</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he uttered the word De&s;pair, he was going to plunge into the lake beneath him, at once to &s;atisfy his doubts, and put a period to his anxiety; when he perceived a mo&s;t maje&s;tic being walking on the &s;urface of the water, and approaching the bank on which he &s;tood.

<P>IT is allowed on all hands, that our Engli&s;h divines receive a more liberal education, and improve that education, by fre|quent &s;tudy, more than any others of this reverend profe&s;&s;ion in Europe. In general, al&s;o, it may be ob&s;erved, that a great|er degree of gentility is affixed to the character of a &s;tudent in England than el&s;ewhere; by which means our clergy have an opportunity of &s;eeing better company while young, and of &s;ooner wearing off tho&s;e prejudices which they are apt to im|bibe even in the be&s;t regulated univer&s;ities, and which may be ju&s;tly termed the vulgar errors of the wi&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet, with all the&s;e advantages, it is very obvious, that the clergy are no where &s;o little thought of, by the populace, as here; and, though our divines are foremo&s;t, with re&s;pect to abilities, yet they are found la&s;t in the effects of their mini&s;try;
<PB N="89" REF="89">
the vulgar, in general, appearing no way impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of religious duty. I am not for whining at the depra|vity of the times, or for endeavouring to paint a pro&s;pect more gloomy than in nature; but certain it is, no per&s;on who has travelled will contradict me, when I aver, that the lower or|ders of mankind, in other countries, te&s;tify, on every occa&s;i|on, the profounde&s;t awe of religion; while in England they are &s;carcely awakened into a &s;en&s;e of its duties, even in cir|cum&s;tances of the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>This di&s;&s;olute and fearle&s;s conduct foreigners are apt to at|tribute to climate and con&s;titution; may not the vulgar being pretty much neglected in our exhortations from the pulpit, be a con&s;piring cau&s;e? Our divines &s;eldom &s;toop to their mean capacities; and they who want in&s;truction mo&s;t, find lea&s;t in our religious a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>Whatever may become of the higher orders of mankind, who are generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of collateral motives to virtue, the vulgar &s;hould be particularly regarded, who&s;e behaviour in civil life is totally hinged upon their hopes and fears. Tho&s;e who con&s;titute the ba&s;is of the great fabric of &s;ociety, &s;hould be particularly regarded; for, in policy, as in architecture, ruin is mo&s;t fatal when it begins from the bottom.</P>
<P>Men of real &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding prefer a prudent me|diocrity to a precarious popularity; and, fearing to outdo their duty, leave it half done. Their di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit are generally dry, methodical, and unaffecting; deliver|ed with the mo&s;t in&s;ipid calmne&s;s; in&s;omuch, that, &s;hould the peaceful preacher lift his head over the cu&s;hion, which alone he &s;eems to addre&s;s, he might di&s;cover his audience, in|&s;tead of being awakened to remor&s;e, actually &s;leeping over his methodical and laboured compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>This method of preaching is, however, by &s;ome called an addre&s;s to rea&s;on, and not to the pa&s;&s;ions; this is &s;tiled the making of converts from conviction: but &s;uch are indif|ferently acquainted with human nature, who are not &s;en&s;ible,
<PB N="90" REF="90">
that men &s;eldom rea&s;on about their debaucheries till they are committed; rea&s;on is but a weak antagoni&s;t when headlong pa&s;&s;ion dictates; in all &s;uch ca&s;es we &s;hould arm one pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t another; it is with the human mind as in nature, from the mixture of two oppo&s;ites the re&s;ult is mo&s;t frequently neutral tranquility. Tho&s;e who attempt to rea&s;on us out of our follies, begin at the wrong end, &s;ince the attempt natu|rally pre&s;uppo&s;es us capable of rea&s;on; but to be made ca|pable of this, is one great point of the cure.</P>
<P>There are but few talents requi&s;ite to become a popular preacher, for the people are ea&s;ily plea&s;ed if they &s;ee any en|deavours in the orator to plea&s;e them; the meane&s;t qualifi|cations will work this effect, if the preacher &s;incerely &s;ets a|bout it. Perhaps little, indeed very little more is required, than &s;incerity and a&s;&s;urance; and a becoming &s;incerity is al|ways certain of producing a becoming a&s;&s;urance. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Si vis me flere, dolendum e&s;t primum tibi ip&s;i,"</Q> is &s;o trite a quo|tation, that it almo&s;t demands an apology to repeat it; yet, though all allow the ju&s;tice of the remark, how few do we find put it in practice! Our orators, with the mo&s;t faulty ba&s;hfulne&s;s, &s;eem impre&s;&s;ed rather with an awe of their au|dience than with a ju&s;t re&s;pect for the truths they are about to deliver; they, of all profe&s;&s;ions, &s;eem the mo&s;t ba&s;hful, who have the greate&s;t right to glory in their commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The French preachers generally a&s;&s;ume all that dignity which becomes men who are amba&s;&s;adors from Chri&s;t: the Engli&s;h divines, like erroneous envoys, &s;eem more &s;olicitous not to offend the court to which they are &s;ent, than to drive home the intere&s;ts of their employer. The bi&s;hop of Ma|&s;illon, in the fir&s;t &s;ermon he ever preached, found the whole audience, upon his getting into the pulpit, in a di&s;po&s;ition no way favourable to his intentions; their nods, whi&s;pers, or drow&s;y behaviour, &s;hewed him that there was no great pro|fit to be expected from his &s;owing in a &s;oil &s;o improper; how|ever, he &s;oon changed the di&s;po&s;ition of his audience by the
<PB N="91" REF="91">
manner of his beginning: <Q REND="inline">"If,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a cau&s;e, the mo&s;t important that could be conceived, were to be tried at the bar before qualified judges; if this cau&s;e intere&s;ted our&s;elves in particular; if the eyes of the whole kingdom were fixed upon the event; if the mo&s;t eminent coun&s;el were employed on both &s;ides; and if we had heard from our infancy of this yet undetermined trial; would you not all &s;it with due attention, and warm expectation, to the pleadings on each &s;ide? Would not all your hopes and fears be hinged upon the final deci&s;ion? And yet, let me tell you, you have this moment a cau&s;e of much greater importance before you; a cau&s;e where not one nation, but all the world, are &s;pectators; tried, not before a fallible tribunal, but the awful throne of Heaven, where not your temporal and tran&s;itory intere&s;ts are the &s;ubject of debate, but your eternal happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, where the cau&s;e is &s;till undetermined; but, perhaps, the very moment I am &s;peaking may fix the irrevocable decree that &s;hall la&s;t for ever; and yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, you can hardly &s;it with patience, to hear the tidings of your own &s;alva|tion; I plead the cau&s;e of Heaven, and yet I am &s;carcely attended to,"</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The &s;tile, the abruptne&s;s of a beginning like this, in the clo&s;et would appear ab&s;urd; but in the pulpit it is attended with the mo&s;t la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions: that &s;tile which, in the clo&s;et, might ju&s;tly be called flim&s;y, &s;eems the true mode of elo|quence here. I never read a fine compo&s;ition, under the title of a &s;ermon, that I do not think the author has mi&s;called his piece; for the talents to be u&s;ed in writing well, entirely differ from tho&s;e of &s;peaking well. The qualifications for &s;peaking, as has been already ob&s;erved, are ea&s;ily acquired; they are accompli&s;hments which may be taken up by every candidate who will be at the pains of &s;tooping. Impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the truths he is about to deliver, a preacher di&s;regards the applau&s;e or the contempt of his audience, and
<PB N="92" REF="92">
he in&s;en&s;ibly a&s;&s;umes a ju&s;t and manly &s;incerity. With this talent alone we &s;ee what crouds are drawn around enthu&s;ia&s;ts, even de&s;titute of common-&s;en&s;e; what numbers converted to Chri&s;tianity. Folly may &s;ometimes &s;et an example for wi&s;dom to practi&s;e, and our regular divines may borrow in|&s;truction from even methodi&s;ts, who go their circuits, and preach prizes among the populace. Even Whitefield may be placed as a model to &s;ome of our young divines; let them join to their own good &s;en&s;e his earne&s;t manner of deli|very.</P>
<P>It will be perhaps be objected, that, by confining the ex|cellencies of a preacher to proper a&s;&s;urance, earne&s;tne&s;s, and openne&s;s of &s;tyle, I make the qualifications too trifling for e&s;timation: there will be &s;omething called oratory brought up on this occa&s;ion; action, attitude, grace, elocution, may be repeated as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to complete the character; but let us not be deceived; common-&s;en&s;e is &s;eldom &s;wayed by fine tones, mu&s;ical periods, ju&s;t attitudes, or the di&s;play of a white handkerchief; oratorial behaviour, except in very able hands indeed, generally &s;inks into aukward and paltry affectation.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, however, that the&s;e rules are calcu|lated only for him who would in&s;truct the vulgar, who &s;tand in mo&s;t need of in&s;truction; to addre&s;s philo&s;ophers, and to obtain the character of a polite preacher among the polite&mdash;a much more u&s;ele&s;s, though more &s;ought-for character&mdash;re|quires a different method of proceeding. All I &s;hall ob&s;erve on this head is, to entreat the polemic divine, in his contro|ver&s;y with the Dei&s;ts, to act rather offen&s;ively than to defend; to pu&s;h home the grounds of his belief, and the impracticability of theirs, rather than to &s;pend time in &s;olving the objections of every opponent. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is ten to one,"</Q> &s;ays a late writer on the art of war, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but that the a&s;&s;ailant who attacks the enemy in his trenches is always victorious."</Q></P>
<P>Yet, upon the whole, our clergy might employ them&s;elves
<PB N="93" REF="93">
more to the benefit of &s;ociety, by declining all controver&s;y, than by exhibiting even the profounde&s;t &s;kill in polemic di&s;|putes; their conte&s;ts with each other often turn on &s;pecula|tive trifles; and their di&s;putes with the Dei&s;ts are almo&s;t at an end, &s;ince they can have no more than victory, and that they are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, as their antagoni&s;ts have been driven into a confe&s;&s;ion of the nece&s;&s;ity of revelation, or an open avowal of athei&s;m.

<HEAD>ESSAY XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE frequently been amazed at the ignorance of almo&s;t all the European travellers, who have penetrated any con&s;i|derable way ea&s;tward into A&s;ia. They all have been in|fluenced either by motives of commerce or piety, and their accounts are &s;uch as might rea&s;onably be expected from men of a very narrow or very prejudiced education, the dictates of &s;uper&s;tition, or the re&s;ult of ignorance. Is it not &s;urpri&s;ing, that, of &s;uch a variety of adventurers, not one &s;ingle philo|&s;opher &s;hould be found among the number? For, as to the travels of Gemelli, the learned are long agreed that the whole is but an impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce any country, how rude or uncultivated &s;oever, where the inhabitants are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome pecu|liar &s;ecrets, either in nature or art, which might be tran&s;|planted with &s;ucce&s;s: thus, for in&s;tance, in Siberian Tartary, the natives extract a &s;trong &s;pirit from milk, which is a &s;ecret probably unknown to the chymi&s;ts of Europe. In the mo&s;t
<PB N="94" REF="94">
&s;avage parts of India they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ecret of dying vegetable &s;ub&s;tances &s;carlet, and likewi&s;e that of refining lead into a metal, which, for hardne&s;s and colour, is little in|ferior to &s;ilver; not one of which &s;ecrets but would, in Eu|rope, make a man's fortune. The power of the A&s;iatics in producing winds, or bringing down rain, the Europeans are apt to treat as fabulous, becau&s;e they have no in&s;tances of the like nature among them&s;elves; but they would have treated the &s;ecrets of gunpowder, and the mariner's compa&s;s, in the &s;ame manner, had they been told the Chine&s;e u&s;ed &s;uch arts before the invention was common with them&s;elves at home.</P>
<P>Of all the Engli&s;h philo&s;ophers, I mo&s;t reverence Bacon, that great and hardy genius: he it is who, undaunted by the &s;eeming difficulties that oppo&s;e, prompts human curio&s;ity to examine every part of nature; and even exhorts man to try whether he cannot &s;ubject the tempe&s;t, the thunder, and even earthquakes, to human controul. Oh! had a man of his dar|ing &s;pirit, of his genius, penetration, and learning, travelled to tho&s;e countries which have been vi&s;ited only by the &s;uper&s;ti|tious and mercenary, what might not mankind expect! How would he enlighten the regions to which he travelled! And what a variety of knowledge and u&s;eful improvement would he not bring back in exchange!</P>
<P>There is probably no country &s;o barbarous, that would not di&s;clo&s;e all it knew, if it received equivalent information; and I am apt to think, that a per&s;on, who was ready to give more knowledge than he received, would be welcome where|ever he came. All his care in travelling &s;hould only be to &s;uit his intellectual banquet to the people with whom he conver&s;ed: he &s;hould not attempt to teach the unlettered Tartar a&s;tro|nomy, nor yet in&s;truct the polite Chine&s;e in the arts of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence: he &s;hould endeavour to improve the barbarian in the &s;ecrets of living comfortably; and the inhabitant of a more refined country in the &s;peculative plea&s;ures of &s;cience. How much more nobly would a philo&s;opher, thus employed, &s;pend
<PB N="95" REF="95">
his time, than by &s;itting at home, earne&s;tly intent upon add|ing one &s;tar more to his catalogue, or one mon&s;ter more to his collection? or &s;till, if po&s;&s;ible, more triflingly &s;edulous in the incatenation of fleas, or the &s;culpture of cherry-&s;tones.</P>
<P>I never con&s;ider this &s;ubject, without being &s;urpri&s;ed that none of tho&s;e &s;ocieties, &s;o laudably e&s;tabli&s;hed in England for the promotion of arts and learning, have ever thought of &s;end|ing one of their members into the mo&s;t ea&s;tern parts of A&s;ia, to make what di&s;coveries he was able. To be convinced of the utility of &s;uch an undertaking, let them but read the re|lations of their own travellers. It will there be found, that they are as often deceived them&s;elves, as they attempt to de|ceive others. The merchants tells us, perhaps, the price of different commodities, the methods of baleing them up, and the propere&s;t manner for an European to pre&s;erve his health in the country. The mi&s;&s;ioner, on the other hand, informs us with what plea&s;ure the country to which he was &s;ent em|braced Chri&s;tianity: and the numbers he converted; what methods he took to keep Lent in a region where there was no fi&s;h, or the &s;hifts he made to celebrate the rites of his reli|gion, in places where there was neither bread nor wine; &s;uch accounts, with the u&s;ual appendage of marriages and funerals, in&s;criptions, rivers, and mountains, make up the whole of an European traveller's diary; but as to all the &s;ecrets of which the inhabitants are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, tho&s;e are univer&s;ally attributed to magic; and when the traveller can give no other account of the wonders he &s;ees performed, he very contentedly a&s;cribes them to the devil.</P>
<P>It was an u&s;ual ob&s;ervation of Boyle, the Engli&s;h chymi&s;t, that, if every arti&s;t would but di&s;cover what new ob&s;ervations occured to him in the exerci&s;e of his trade, philo&s;ophy would thence gain innumerable improvements. It may be ob&s;erved, with &s;till greater ju&s;tice, that, if the u&s;eful knowledge of every country, how&s;oever barbarous, was gleaned by a judi|cious ob&s;erver, the advantages would be ine&s;timable. Are
<PB N="96" REF="96">
there not, even in Europe, many u&s;eful inventions, known or practi&s;ed but in one place? Their in&s;trument, as an example, for cutting down corn in Germany, is much more handy and expeditious, in my opinion, than the &s;ickle u&s;ed in England. The cheap and expeditious manner of making vinegar, with|out previous fermentation, is known only in a part of France. If &s;uch di&s;coveries therefore remain &s;till to be known at home, what funds of knowledge might not be collected in countries yet unexplored, or only pa&s;&s;ed through by ignorant travellers in ha&s;ty caravans?</P>
<P>The caution with which foreigners are received in A&s;ia, may be alledged as an objection to &s;uch a de&s;ign.

<P>THE improvements we make in mental acquirements, on|ly render us each day more &s;en&s;ible of the defects of our con|&s;titution: with this in view, therefore, let us often recur to the amu&s;ements of youth; endeavour to forget age and wi&s;|dom, and, as far as innocence goes, be as much a boy as the be&s;t of them.</P>
<P>Let idle declaimers mourn over the degeneracy of the age; but, in my opinion, every age is the &s;ame. This I am &s;ure of, that man, in every &s;ea&s;on, is a poor fretful being, with no other means to e&s;cape the calamities of the times, but by endeavouring to forget them; for, if he attempts to re&s;i&s;t, he is certainly undone. If I feel poverty and pain, I am not &s;o hardy as to quarrel with the executioner, even while under cor|rection: I find my&s;elf no way di&s;po&s;ed to make fine &s;peeches, while I am making wry faces. In a word, let me drink when the fit is on, to make me in&s;en&s;ible; and drink when it is over, for joy that I feel pain no longer.</P>
<P>The character of old Fal&s;taff, even with all his faults, gives me more con&s;olation than the mo&s;t &s;tudied efforts of wi&s;dom: I here behold an agreeable old fellow, forgetting age, and &s;hewing me the way to be young at &s;ixty-five. Sure I am well able to be as merry, though not &s;o comical, as he.&mdash;Is it not in my power to have, though not &s;o much wit, at lea&s;t as much vivacity?&mdash;Age, care, wi&s;dom, reflection, begone!&mdash;I give you to the winds. Let's have t'other bottle: here's to the memory of Shake&s;pear, Fal&s;taff, and all the merry men of Ea&s;t-cheap.</P>
<P>Such were the reflections that naturally aro&s;e while I &s;at at the Boar's-head tavern, &s;till kept at Ea&s;t-cheap. Here, by a plea&s;ant fire, in the very room where old Sir John Fal&s;taff
<PB N="98" REF="98">
cracked his jokes, in the very chair which was &s;ometimes ho|noured by prince Henry, and &s;ometimes polluted by his im|moral merry companions, I &s;at and ruminated on the follies of youth; wi&s;hed to be young again; but was re&s;olved to make the be&s;t of life while it la&s;ted, and now and then compared pa&s;t and pre&s;ent times together. I con&s;idered my&s;elf as the only living repre&s;entative of the old knight, and tran&s;ported my imagination back to the times when the prince and he gave life to the revel, and made even debauchery not di&s;gu&s;ting. The room al&s;o con&s;pired to throw my reflections back into antiquity: the oak floor, the Gothic windows, and the pon|derous chimney-piece, had long with&s;tood the tooth of time: the watchman had gone twelve: my companions had all &s;tolen off, and none now remained with me but the landlord. From him I could have wi&s;hed to know the hi&s;tory of a tavern that had &s;uch a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cu&s;tomers: I could not help thinking that an account of this kind would be a plea&s;ing con|tra&s;t of the manners of different ages; but my landlord could give me no information. He continued to doze and &s;ot, and tell a tedious &s;tory, as mo&s;t other landlords u&s;ually do; and, though he &s;aid nothing, yet was never &s;ilent: one good joke followed another good joke; and the be&s;t joke of all was ge|nerally begun towards the end of a bottle. I found at la&s;t, however, his wine and his conver&s;ation operate by degrees: he in&s;en&s;ibly began to alter his appearance. His cravat &s;eem|ed quilled into a ruff, and his breeches &s;welled out into a far|dingale. I now fancied him changing &s;exes: and, as my eyes began to clo&s;e in &s;lumber, I imagined my fat landlord actually converted into as fat a landlady. However, &s;leep made but few changes in my &s;ituation: the tavern, the apartment, and the table, continued as before; nothing &s;uffered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">utation but my ho&s;t, who was fairly altered into a gentlewoman, whom I knew to be dame Quickly, mi&s;tre&s;s of this tavern in the days of Sir John; and the liquor we were drinking, which &s;eemed converted into &s;ack and &s;ugar.</P>

my looks while I was by, but I could hear them &s;ay I was wearing when my back was turned. The prior, however, &s;till was con&s;tant, and &s;o were half his convent: but one fa|tal morning he mi&s;&s;ed the u&s;ual beverage; for I had incauti|ou&s;ly drank over night the la&s;t bottle my&s;elf.

<P><Q REND="inline">"My body was no &s;ooner laid in the du&s;t, than the prior and &s;everal of his convent came to purify the tavern from the pollutions with which they &s;aid I had filled it.

My habitation was &s;oon converted into a mona&s;tery; in&s;tead of cu&s;tomers now applying for &s;ack and &s;ugar, my rooms were crowded with images, reliques, &s;aints, whores, and friars. In&s;tead of being a &s;cene of occa&s;ional de|bauchery, it was now filled with continual lewdne&s;s. The prior led the fa&s;hion, and the whole convent imitated his pi|ous example. Matrons came hither to confe&s;s their &s;ins, and to commit new. Virgins came hither who &s;eldom went vir|gins away. Nor was this a convent peculiarly wicked; every convent at that period was equally fond of plea&s;ure, and gave a boundle&s;s loo&s;e to appetite. The laws allowed it; each prie&s;t had a right to a favourite companion, and a power of di&s;carding her as often as he plea&s;ed. The laity grumbled, quarrelled with their wives and daughters, hated their con|fe&s;&s;ors, and mantained them in opulence and ea&s;e.

her hu&s;band unexpectedly came in upon them, and te&s;tified all the indignation which was natural upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion. The prior a&s;&s;ured the gentleman that it was the devil who had put it into his heart; and the lady was very certain, that &s;he was under the influence of magic, or &s;he could never have behaved in &s;o unfaithful a manner. The hu&s;band, however, was not to be put off by &s;uch eva&s;ions, but &s;ummoned both before the tribunal of ju&s;tice. His proofs were flagrant, and he expected large damages. Such, indeed, he had a right to expect, were the tribunals of tho&s;e days con|&s;tituted in the &s;ame manner as they are now. The cau&s;e of the prie&s;t was to be tried before an a&s;&s;embly of prie&s;ts; and a layman was to expect redre&s;s only from their impartiality and candour. What plea then do you think the prior made to obviate this accu&s;ation? He denied the fact, and charged the plaintiff to try the merits of their cau&s;e by &s;ingle combat. It was a little hard, you may be &s;ure, upon the poor gentleman, not only to be made a cuckold, but to be obliged to &s;ight a duel into the bargain; yet &s;uch was the ju&s;tice of the times. The prior threw down his glove, and the injured hu&s;band was obliged to take it up, in token of his accepting the challenge.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Upon this, the prie&s;t &s;upplied his champion, for it was not lawful for the clergy to fight; and the defendant and plaintiff, according to cu&s;tom, were put in pri&s;on; both or|dered to fa&s;t and pray, every method being previou&s;ly u&s;ed to induce both to a confe&s;&s;ion of the truth. After a month's impri|&s;onment, the hair of each was cut, the bodies anointed with oil, the field of battle appointed and guarded by &s;oldiers, while his maje&s;ty pre&s;ided over the whole in per&s;on.

They prayed and confe&s;&s;ed upon their knees; and af|ter the&s;e ceremonies, the re&s;t was left to the courage and con|duct of the combatants. As the champion whom the prior had pitched upon, had fought &s;ix or eight times upon &s;imilar

The lady became a nun, the prior was made bi&s;hop, and three Wickliffites were burned in the illuminations and fireworks that were made on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.

The lady whom the prior had placed in a nunnery, and whom he continued to vi&s;it for &s;ome time with great punctuality, began at la&s;t to perceive that &s;he was quite for&s;aken. Secluded from conver&s;ation, as u&s;ual, &s;he now entertained the vi&s;ions of a devotee; found her&s;elf &s;trangely di&s;turbed; but he&s;itated in determining whether &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an angel or a daemon.

within her. In &s;hort, &s;he was bewitched; and all the diffi|culty lay in determining who it could be that bewitched her. The nuns and monks all demanded the magician's name, but the devil made no reply; for he knew they had no authority to a&s;k que&s;tions. By the rules of witchcraft, when an evil &s;pirit has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he may refu&s;e to an&s;wer any que&s;|tions a&s;ked him, unle&s;s they are put by a bi&s;hop, and to the&s;e he is obliged to reply. A bi&s;hop, therefore, was &s;ent for, and now the whole &s;ecret came out: the devil reluctant|ly owned that he was a &s;ervant of the prior; that, by his command, he re&s;ided in his pre&s;ent habitation; and that, with|out his command, he was re&s;olved to keep in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The bi&s;hop was an able exorci&s;t; he drove the devil out by force of my&s;tical arms; the prior was arraigned for witchcraft; the wit|ne&s;&s;es were &s;trong and numerous again&s;t him, not le&s;s than fourteen per&s;ons being by, who had heard the devil talk Latin.

About ten, mi&s;s generally went to play at hot-cockles and blindman's buff in the parlour; and when the young folks (for they &s;eldom played at hot-cockles when grown old) were tired of &s;uch amu&s;ements, the gentlemen entertained mi&s;s with the hi&s;tory of their greyhounds, bear|beatings, and victories at cudgel-playing. If the weather was fine, they ran at the ring, &s;hot at butts, while mi&s;s held in her hand a ribbon, with which &s;he adorned the conque|ror. Her mental qualifications were exactly fitted to her ex|ternal accompli&s;hments. Before &s;he was fifteen, &s;he could tell the &s;tory of Jack the Giant Killer, could name every mountain that was inhabited by fairies, knew a witch at fir&s;t &s;ight, and could repeat four Latin prayers without a promp|ter.

The king loved her for &s;ome time; but, at length, repenting of his mi&s;deeds, and in&s;tigated by his father-confe&s;&s;or, from a prin|ciple of con&s;cience removed her from his levee to the bar of this tavern, and took a new mi&s;tre&s;s in her &s;tead. Let it not &s;urpri&s;e you to behold the mi&s;tre&s;s of a king degraded to &s;o humble an office. As the ladies had no mental accompli&s;h|ments, a good face was enough to rai&s;e them to the royal couch: and &s;he who was this day a royal mi&s;tre&s;s, might, the next, when her beauty palled upon enjoyment, be doom|ed to infamy and want.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Under the care of this lady, the tavern grew into great reputation; the courtiers had not yet learned to game, but they paid it off by drinking; drunkenne&s;s is ever the vice of a barbarous, and gaming of a luxurious age. They had not &s;uch frequent entertainments as the moderns have, but they were more expen&s;ive and more luxurious in tho&s;e they had. All their fooleries were more elaborate and more ad|mired by the great and the vulgar than now. A courtier has been known to &s;pend his whole fortune at a &s;ingle fea&s;t, a

The&s;e were the times, Sir, when kings kept mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and got drunk in public; they were too plain and &s;imple in tho&s;e happy times to hide their vices, and act the hypocrite, as now."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Lord!

The gallants of tho&s;e times pretty much re&s;embled the bloods of ours; they were fond of plea&s;ure, but quite ignorant of the art of refining upon it: thus a court-bawd of tho&s;e times re&s;embled the common low-lived harridan of a modern bagnio. Witne&s;s, ye powers of de|bauchery, how often I have been pre&s;ent at the various ap|pearances of drunkenne&s;s, riot, guilt, and brutality!

<P><Q REND="inline">"Upon this lady's decea&s;e the tavern was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively oc|cupied by adventurers, bullies, pimps, and game&s;ters. To|wards the conclu&s;ion of the reign of Henry VII. gaming was

more univer&s;ally practi&s;ed in England than now. Kings them|&s;elves have been known to play off, at Primero, not only all the money and jewels they could part with, but the very images in churches. The la&s;t Henry played away, in this very room, not only the four great bells of St. Paul's cathe|dral, but the fine image of St. Paul, which &s;tood upon the top of the &s;pire, to Sir Miles Partridge, who took them down the next day, and &s;old them by auction. Have you then any cau&s;e to regret being born in the times you now live? Or do you &s;till believe that human nature continues to run on declining every age? If we ob&s;erve the actions of the bu&s;y part of mankind, your ance&s;tors will be found infi|nitely more gro&s;s, &s;ervile, and even di&s;hone&s;t, than you. If, for&s;aking hi&s;tory, we only trace them in their hours of a|mu&s;ement and di&s;&s;ipation, we &s;hall find them more &s;en&s;ual, more entirely devoted to plea&s;ure, and infinitely more &s;elfi&s;h.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The la&s;t ho&s;te&s;s of note I find upon record was Jane Rou&s;e. She was born among the lower ranks of the people; and, by frugality and extreme complai&s;ance, contrived to ac|quire a moderate fortune; this &s;he might have enjoyed for many years, had &s;he not unfortunately quarrelled with one of her neighbours, a woman who was in high repute for &s;anctity through the whole pari&s;h. In the times of which I &s;peak, two women &s;eldom quarrelled, that one did not ac|cu&s;e the other of witchcraft, and &s;he who fir&s;t contrived to vomit crooked pins was &s;ure to come off victorious. The &s;candal of a modern tea-table differs widely from the &s;candal of former times; the fa&s;cination of a lady's eyes, at pre&s;ent, is regarded as a compliment; but, if a lady, formerly, &s;hould be accu&s;ed of having witchcraft in her eyes, it were much better both for her &s;oul and body, that &s;he had no eyes at all.</Q></P>

<P>WHATEVER may be the merits of the Engli&s;h in other &s;ciences, they &s;eem peculiarly excellent in the art of healing. There is &s;carcely a di&s;order incident to humanity, again&s;t which our adverti&s;ing doctors are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a mo&s;t infalliable antidote. The profe&s;&s;ors of other arts confe&s;s the inevitable intricacy of things; talk with doubt, and decide with he&s;itation; but doubting is entirely unknown in medicine;
<PB N="111" REF="111">
the adverti&s;ing profe&s;&s;ors here delight in ca&s;es of diffi|culty: be the di&s;order never &s;o de&s;perate or radical, you will find numbers in every &s;treet, who, by levelling a pill at the part affected, promi&s;e a certain cure, without lo&s;s of time, knowledge of a bed-fellow, or hinderance of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider the a&s;&s;iduity of this profe&s;&s;ion, their bene|volence amazes me. They not only in general, give their medicines for half value, but u&s;e the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive remon|&s;trances to induce the &s;ick to come and be cured. Sure there mu&s;t be &s;omething &s;trangely ob&s;tinate in an Engli&s;h patient, who refu&s;es &s;o much health upon &s;uch ea&s;y terms! Does he take a pride in being bloated with a drop&s;y? Does he find plea&s;ure in the alternations of an intermittent fever? Or feel as much &s;atisfaction in nur&s;ing up his gout, as he found plea|&s;ure in acquiring it? He mu&s;t, otherwi&s;e he would never re|ject &s;uch repeated a&s;&s;urances of in&s;tant relief. What can be more convincing than the manner in which the &s;ick are in|vited to be well? The doctor fir&s;t begs the mo&s;t earne&s;t at|tention of the public to what he is going to propo&s;e; he &s;o|lenmly affirms the pill was never found to want &s;ucce&s;s; he produces a li&s;t of tho&s;e who have been re&s;cued from the grave by taking it. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, there are many here who now and then think proper to be &s;ick: only &s;ick did I &s;ay? There are &s;ome who even think proper to die! Yes, by the head of Confucius, they die; though they might have purcha&s;ed the health-re&s;toring &s;pecific for half a crown at every corner.</P>
<P>I can never enough admire the &s;agacity of this country for the encouragement given to the profe&s;&s;ors of this art; with what indulgence does &s;he fo&s;ter up tho&s;e of her own growth, and kindly cheri&s;h tho&s;e that come from abroad! Like a &s;kil|ful gardener &s;he invites them from every foreign climate to her&s;elf. Here every great exotic &s;trikes root as &s;oon as im|ported, and feels the genial beam of favour; while the mighty metropolis, like one va&s;t munificent dunghill, receives them
<PB N="112" REF="112">
indi&s;criminately to her brea&s;t, and &s;upplies each with more than native nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>In other countries, the phy&s;ician pretends to cure di&s;orders in the lump; the &s;ame doctor who combats the gout in the toe, &s;hall pretend to pre&s;cribe for a pain in the head; and he who at one time cures a con&s;umption, &s;hall at another give drugs for a drop&s;y. How ab&s;urd and ridiculous! This is be|ing a mere jack of all trades. Is the animal machine le&s;s complicated than a bra&s;s pin? Not le&s;s than ten different hands are required to make a bra&s;s pin; and &s;hall the body be &s;et right by one &s;ingle operator?</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h are &s;en&s;ible of the force of this rea&s;oning; they have therefore one doctor for the eyes, another for the toes; they have their &s;ciatic doctors, and inoculating doctors; they have one doctor who is mode&s;tly content with &s;ecuring them from bug-bites, and five hundred who pre&s;cribe for the bite of mad dogs.</P>
<P>But as nothing plea&s;es curio&s;ity more than anecdotes of the great, however minute or trifling, I mu&s;t pre&s;ent you, inade|quate as my abilities are to the &s;ubject, with an account of one or two of tho&s;e per&s;onages who lead in this honourable profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t upon the li&s;t of glory is Doctor Richard Rock, F. U. N. This great man is &s;hort of &s;tature, is fat, and waddles as he walks. He always wears a white three-tailed wig, nicely combed, and frizzled upon each cheek. Some|times he carries a cane, but a hat never; it is indeed very remarkable that this extraordinary per&s;onage &s;hould never wear a hat; but &s;o it is, an hat he never wears. He is u|&s;ually drawn, at the top of his own bills, &s;itting in his arm|chair, holding a little bottle between his finger and thumb, and &s;urrounded with rotten teeth, nippers, pills, pacquets, and gally-pots. No man can promi&s;e fairer or better than he; for, as he ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline">"Be your di&s;order never &s;o far gone, be un|der no unea&s;ine&s;s, make your&s;elf quite ea&s;y, I can cure you."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="113">
The next in fame, though by &s;ome reckoned of equal pre|ten&s;ions, is Doctor Timothy Franks, F.O.G.H. living in the Old Bailey. As Rock is remarkably &s;quab, his great ri|val Franks is as remarkably tall. He was born in the year of the Chri&s;tian Aera 1692, and is, while I now write, exactly &s;ixty-eight years, three months, and four days old. Age, however, has no ways impaired his u&s;ual health and vivacity; I am told he generally walks with his brea&s;t open. This gentle|man, who is of a mixed reputation, is particularly remarkable for a becoming a&s;&s;urance, which carries him gently through life; for, except Doctor Rock, none are more ble&s;&s;ed with the advantages of face than Doctor Franks.</P>
<P>And yet the great have their foibles as well as the little. I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to mention it.&mdash;Let the foibles of the great re&s;t in peace.&mdash;Yet I mu&s;t impart the whole.&mdash;The&s;e two great men are actually now at variance; like mere men, mere common mortals. Rock advi&s;es the world to beware of bog-trotting quacks; Franks retorts the wit and the &s;arca&s;m, by fixing on his rival the odious appel|lation of Dumpling Dick. He calls the &s;erious Doctor Rock, Dumpling Dick! Head of Confucius, what profanation! Dumpling Dick! What a pity, ye powers, that the learned, who were born mutually to a&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t in enlightening the world &s;hould thus differ among them&s;elves, and make even the pro|fe&s;&s;ion ridiculous! Sure the world is wide enough, at lea&s;t, for two great per&s;onages to figure in; men of &s;cience &s;hould leave controver&s;y to the little world below them; and then we might &s;ee Rock and Franks walking together, hand in hand, &s;miling onward to immortality.</P>

<P>I AM fond of amu&s;ement in whatever company it is to be found; and wit, though dre&s;&s;ed in rags, is ever plea&s;ing to me.

There were but few in the walks, and tho&s;e who &s;tayed, &s;eem|ed by their looks rather more willing to forget that they had an appetite, than gain one. I &s;at down on one of the benches, at the other end of which was &s;eated a man in very &s;habby cloaths.</P>
<P>We continued to groan, to hem, and to cough, as u&s;ual up|on &s;uch occa&s;ions; and, at la&s;t, ventured upon conver&s;ation. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I beg pardon, &s;ir,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but I think I have &s;een you before; your face is familiar to me."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes &s;ir,"</Q> replied he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have a good familiar face, as my friends tell me.

<P>As I never refu&s;e a &s;mall expence for the &s;ake of a merry companion, we in&s;tantly adjourned to a neighbouring ale|hou&s;e; and, in a few moments, had a frothing tankard, and a &s;moaking &s;teak &s;pread on the table before us. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s how much the &s;ight of &s;uch good cheer improved my companion's vivacity. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I like this dinner, &s;ir,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for three rea&s;ons: fir&s;t, becau&s;e I am naturally fond of beef; &s;econdly, becau&s;e I am hungry; and, thirdly and la&s;tly, becau&s;e I get it for nothing: no meat eats &s;o &s;weet as that for which we do not pay."</Q></P>

<Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t know, then, that I am very well de&s;cended; my ance&s;tors have made &s;ome noi&s;e in the world; for my mother cried oy&s;ters, and my father beat a drum: I am told we have even had &s;ome trumpeters in our family. Many a nobleman cannot &s;hew &s;o re&s;pectful a genealogy: but that is neither here nor there. As I was their only child, my father de&s;igned to breed me up to his own employment, which was that of drummer to a puppet-&s;hew. Thus the whole employment of my younger years was that of interpreter to Punch and king Solomon in all his glory. But, though my father was very fond of in&s;tructing me in beating all the marches and points of war, I made no very great progre&s;s, becau&s;e I naturally had no ear for mu&s;ic; &s;o at the age of fifteen, I went and li&s;t|ed for a &s;oldier. As I had ever hated beating a drum, &s;o I &s;oon found that I di&s;liked carrying a mu&s;quet al&s;o; neither the one trade nor the other were to my ta&s;te, for I was by na|ture fond of being a gentleman: be&s;ides, I was obliged to o|bey my captain; he has his will, I have mine, and you have yours: now I very rea&s;onably concluded, that it was much more comfortable for a man to obey his own will than a|nother's.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The life of a &s;oldier &s;oon therefore gave me the &s;pleen; I a&s;ked leave to quit the &s;ervice; but, as I was tall and &s;trong, my captain thanked me for my kind intention, and &s;aid, be|cau&s;e he had a regard for me, we &s;hould not part.

What could be done? If I have not money, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, to pay for my di&s;charge, I mu&s;t find an equivalent &s;ome other way; and that mu&s;t be by running away.

<Q REND="inline">"Well, I was now fairly rid of my military employment; I &s;old my &s;oldier's cloaths, bought wor&s;e, and, in order not to be overtaken, took the mo&s;t unfrequented roads po&s;&s;ible. One evening, as I was entering a village, I perceived a man, whom I afterwards found to be the curate of the pari&s;h, thrown from his hor&s;e in a miry road, and almo&s;t &s;mothered in the mud. He de&s;ired my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; I gave it, and drew him out with &s;ome difficulty. He thanked me for my trouble, and was going off, but I followed him home, for I loved always to have a man thank me at his own door. The curate a&s;ked an hun|dred que&s;tions; as who&s;e &s;on I was; from whence I came; and whether I would be faithful? I an&s;wered him greatly to his &s;atisfaction; and gave my&s;elf one of the be&s;t characters in the world for &s;obriety, (Sir, I have the honour of drinking your health) di&s;cretion, and fidelity. To make a long &s;tory &s;hort, he wanted a &s;ervant, and hired me. With him I lived but two months; we did not much like each other; I was fond of eating, and he gave me but little to eat: I loved a a pretty girl, and the old woman, my fellow-&s;ervant, was ill|natured and ugly. As they endeavoured to &s;tarve me be|tween them, I made a pious re&s;olution to prevent their com|mitting murder: I &s;tole the eggs as &s;oon as they were laid; I emptied every unfini&s;hed bottle that I could lay my hands on; whatever eatable came in my way was &s;ure to di&s;appear: in &s;hort, they found I would not do; &s;o I was di&s;charged one morning, and paid three &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence for two months wages.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"While my money was getting ready I employed my&s;elf in making preparations for my departure; two hens were hatch|ing in an out-hou&s;e, I went and took the eggs from habit, and, not to &s;eparate the parents from the children, I lodged hens and all in my knap&s;ack. After this piece of frugality, I returned to receive my money, and with my knap&s;ack on my back, and a &s;taff in my hand, I bid adieu, with tears in my eyes, to my old benefactor. I had not gone far from the hou&s;e, when I heard behind me the cry of Stop thief! but this

only increa&s;ed my di&s;patch; it would have been fooli&s;h to &s;top, as I knew the voice could not be levelled at me. But hold, I think I pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e months at the curate's without drinking; come, the times are dry, and may this be my poi&s;on if ever I &s;pent two more pious, &s;tupid months in all my life.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, after travelling &s;ome days, whom &s;hould I light upon, but a company of &s;trolling players. The moment I &s;aw them at a di&s;tance, my heart warmed to them; I had a &s;ort of natural love for every thing of the vagabond order: they were employed in &s;ettling their baggage, which had been overturned in a narrow way; I offered my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which they accepted; and we &s;oon became &s;o well acquaint|ed, that they took me as a &s;ervant. This was a paradi&s;e to me; they &s;ung, danced, drank, eat, and travelled, all at the &s;ame time. By the blood of the Mirabels, I thought I had never lived till then; I grew as merry as a grig, and laughed at every word that was &s;poken. They liked me as much as I liked them; I was a very good figure, as you &s;ee; and, though I was poor, I was not mode&s;t.</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"There is one rule by which a &s;trolling-player may be ever &s;ecure of &s;ucce&s;s; that is, in our theatrical way of ex|pre&s;&s;ing it, to make a great deal of the character. To &s;peak and act as in common life, is not playing, nor is it what people come to &s;ee: natural &s;peaking, like &s;weet wine, runs glibly over the palate, and &s;carce leaves any ta&s;te behind it; but being high in a part re&s;embles vinegar, which grates upon the ta&s;te, and one feels it while he is drinking. To plea&s;e in town and country, the way is, to cry, wring, cringe into attitudes, mark the empha&s;is, &s;lap the pockets, and labour like one in the falling &s;ickne&s;s; that is the way to work for applau&s;e; that is the way to gain it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As we received much reputation for our &s;kill on this fir&s;t exhibition, it was but natural for me to a&s;cribe part of the &s;ucce&s;s to my&s;elf; I &s;nuffed the candles, and, let me tell you, that, without a candle-&s;nuffer, the piece would lo&s;e half its embelli&s;hments. In this manner we continued a fort|night, and drew tolerable hou&s;es; but the evening before our intended departure, we gave out our very be&s;t piece, in which all our &s;trength was to be exerted. We had great expectations from this, and even doubled our prices, when behold one of the principal actors fell ill of a violent fever. This was a &s;troke like thunder to our little company: they were re&s;olved to go in a body, to &s;cold the man for falling &s;ick at &s;o inconvenient a time, and that too of a di&s;order that threatened to be expen&s;ive; I &s;eized the moment, and offer|ed to act the part my&s;elf in his &s;tead.

with the part in my hand and a tankard before me (Sir, your health) and &s;tudied the character, which was to be re|hear&s;ed the next day, and played &s;oon after.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I found my memory exce&s;&s;ively helped by drinking: I learned my part with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity, and bid adieu to &s;nuffing candles ever after.

The tankard would &s;ink to the bottom before I could get thro' the whole of my merits: in &s;hort, I came off like a pro|digy; and, &s;uch was my &s;ucce&s;s, that I could ravi&s;h the laurels even from a &s;irloin of beef. The principal gentlemen and ladies of the town came to me, after the play was over, to compliment me upon my &s;ucce&s;s; one prai&s;ed my voice, another my per&s;on; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Upon my word,"</Q> &s;ays the '&s;quire's lady, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he will make one of the fine&s;t actors in Europe; I &s;ay it, and I think I am &s;omething of a judge."</Q>&mdash;Prai&s;e in the beginning is agreeable enough, and we receive it as a fa|vour; but when it comes in great quantities we regard it only as a debt, which nothing but our merit could extort: in&s;tead of thanking them, I internally applauded my&s;elf. We were de&s;ired to give our piece a &s;econd time; we obey|ed, and I was applauded even more than before.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"At la&s;t we left the town, in order to be at a hor&s;e-race at &s;ome di&s;tance from thence. I &s;hall never think of Tenter|den without tears of gratitude and re&s;pect.

We quitted the town, I &s;ay; and there was a wide difference between my coming in and going out; I entered the town a candle-&s;nuffer, and I quitted it an hero!&mdash;Such is the world; little to-day, and great to-morrow. I could &s;ay a great deal more upon that &s;ubject, truly &s;ublime, upon the ups and downs of fortune; but it would give us both the &s;pleen, and &s;o I &s;hall pa&s;s it over.</Q></P>

I &s;incerely believe that I &s;hould have been the fir&s;t actor in Europe, had my growing merit been properly cultivated; but there came an unkindly fro&s;t, which nipped me in the bud, and levelled me once more down to the common &s;tandard of humanity.

<P>THE formalities, delays, and di&s;appointments, that pre|cede a treaty of marriage here, are u&s;ually as numerous as tho&s;e previous to a treaty of peace. The laws of this coun|try are finely calculated to promote all commerce, but the commerce between the &s;exes. Their encouragements for propagating hemp, madder, and tobacco, are indeed admir|able! Marriages are the only commodity that meets with none.</P>
<P>Yet, from the vernal &s;oftne&s;s of the air, the verdure of the fields, the tran&s;parency of the &s;treams, and the beauty of the women, I know few countries more proper to invite to court&s;hip. Here love might &s;port among painted lawns and warbling groves, and revel amid&s;t gales, wafting at once both fragrance and harmony. Yet it &s;eems he has for&s;aken the i&s;land; and, when a couple are now to be married, mu|tual love, or an union of minds, is the la&s;t and mo&s;t trifling con&s;ideration. If their goods and chattels can be brought to unite, their &s;ympathetic &s;ouls are ever ready to guarantee the treaty. The gentleman's mortgaged lawn becomes ena|moured of the ladies marriageable grove; the match is &s;truck up, and both parties are piou&s;ly in love&mdash;according to act of parliament.</P>
<P>Thus they, who have fortune, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at lea&s;t of &s;omething that is lovely; but I actually pity tho&s;e that have none. I am told there was a time, when ladies, with no o|ther merit but youth, virtue, and beauty, had a chance for hu&s;bands, at lea&s;t, among the mini&s;ters of the church, or the officers of the army. The blu&s;h and innocence of &s;ixteen was &s;aid to have a powerful influence over the&s;e two profe&s;&s;ions. But of late, all the little traffic of blu&s;hing, ogling, dimpling,
<PB N="126" REF="126">
and &s;miling, has been forbidden by an act in that ca&s;e wi&s;ely made and provided. A lady's whole cargo of &s;miles, &s;ighs, and whi&s;pers, is declared utterly contraband, till &s;he arrives in the warm latitudes of twenty-two, where commodities of this nature are too often found to decay. She is then permitted to dimple and &s;mile, when the dimples and &s;miles begin to for|&s;ake her; and, when perhaps grown ugly, is charitably en|tru&s;ted with an unlimited u&s;e of her charms. Her lovers, however, by this time, have for&s;aken her; the captain has changed for another mi&s;tre&s;s; the prie&s;t him&s;elf leaves her in &s;olitude, to bewail her virginity, and &s;he dies even with|out benefit of clergy.</P>
<P>Thus you find the Europeans di&s;couraging love with as much earne&s;tne&s;s as the rude&s;t &s;avage of Sofala. The Genius is &s;ure|ly now no more. In every region I find enemies in arms to oppre&s;s him. Avarice in Europe, jealou&s;y in Per&s;ia, cere|mony in China, poverty among the Tartars, and lu&s;t in Cir|ca&s;&s;ia, are all prepared to oppo&s;e his power. The Genius is certainly bani&s;hed from earth, though once adored under &s;uch a variety of forms. He is no where to be found; and all that the ladies of each country can produce, are but a few trifling reliques, as in&s;tances of his former re&s;idence and fa|vour.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Genius of Love,"</Q> &s;ays the Ea&s;tern Apologue, <Q REND="inline">"had long re&s;ided in the happy plains of Abra, where every breeze was health, and every &s;ound produced tranquility. His temple at fir&s;t was crowded, but every age le&s;&s;ened the number of his votaries, or cooled their devotion. Perceiving therefore his altar at length quite de&s;erted, he was re&s;olved to remove to &s;ome more propitious region; and he apprized the fair &s;ex of every country, where he could hope for a proper reception, to a&s;&s;ert their right to his pre&s;ence among them. In return to this proclamation, emba&s;&s;ies were &s;ent from the ladies of every part of the world to invite him, and to di&s;play the &s;u|periority of their claims.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="127">
<Q REND="inline">"And, fir&s;t, the beauties of China appeared. No coun|try could compare with them for mode&s;ty, either of look, dre&s;s, or behaviour; their eyes were never lifted from the ground; their robes, of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;ilk, hid their hands, bo&s;om, and neck, while their faces only were left uncovered. They indulged no airs that might expre&s;s loo&s;e de&s;ire, and they &s;eemed to &s;tudy only the graces of inanimate beauty. Their black teeth and plucked eye-brows were, however, alledged by the Genius again&s;t them, but he &s;et them entirely a&s;ide when he came to examine their little feet.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The beauties of Circa&s;&s;ia next made their appearance. They advanced, hand in hand, &s;inging the mo&s;t immode&s;t airs, and leading up a dance in the mo&s;t luxurious attitudes. Their dre&s;s was but half a covering; the neck, the left brea&s;t, and all the limbs, were expo&s;ed to view; which, af|ter &s;ome time, &s;eemed rather to &s;atiate than inflame de&s;ire. The lily and the ro&s;e contended in forming their complexions; and a &s;oft &s;leepine&s;s of eye added irre&s;i&s;tible poignance to their charms: but their beauties were obtruded, not offered to their admirers; they &s;eemed to give rather than receive court&s;hip; and the Genius of Love di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them as un|worthy his regard, &s;ince they exchanged the duties of love, and made them&s;elves not the pur&s;ued, but the pur&s;uing &s;ex.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The kingdom of Ka&s;hmire next produced its charming deputies. This happy region &s;eemed peculiarly &s;eque&s;tered by nature for his abode. Shady mountains fenced it on one &s;ide from the &s;corching &s;un; and &s;ea-born breezes, on the other, gave peculiar luxuriance to the air. Their complexions were of a bright yellow that appeared almo&s;t tran&s;parent, while the crim&s;on tulip &s;eemed to blo&s;&s;om on their cheeks. Their features and limbs were delicate beyond the &s;tatuary's power to expre&s;s; and their teeth whiter than their own ivory. He was almo&s;t per&s;uaded to re&s;ide among them,

But their &s;avage education rendered them utterly unqualified to make the proper u&s;e of their power, and they were re|jected, as being incapable of uniting mental with &s;en&s;ual &s;a|tisfaction. In this manner the deputies of other kingdoms had their &s;uits rejected: the black beauties of Benin, and the tawny daughters of Borneo, the women of Wida with &s;carred faces, and the hideous virgins of Cafraria; the &s;quab ladies of Lapland, three feet high, and the giant fair ones of Patagonia.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The beauties of Europe at la&s;t appeared: grace was in their &s;teps, and &s;en&s;ibility &s;at &s;miling in every eye. It was the univer&s;al opinion, while they were approaching, that they would prevail; and the Genius &s;eemed to lend them his mo&s;t favourable attention. They opened their preten&s;ions with the utmo&s;t mode&s;ty; but unfortunately, as their ora|tor proceeded, &s;he happened to let fall the words Hou&s;e in town, Settlement, and Pin-money. The&s;e &s;eemingly harm|le&s;s terms had in&s;tantly a &s;urpri&s;ing effect: the Genius, with ungovernable rage, bur&s;t from amid&s;t the circle; and, wav|ing his youthful pinions, left this earth, and flew back to tho&s;e ethereal man&s;ions from whence he de&s;cended.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The whole a&s;&s;embly was &s;truck with amazement: they now ju&s;tly apprehended that female power would be no more, &s;ince love had for&s;aken them. They continued &s;ome time thus in a &s;tate of torpid de&s;pair, when it was propo&s;ed by one of the number, that, &s;ince the real Genius of Love had left them, in order to continue their power, they &s;hould &s;et up an idol in his &s;tead; and that the ladies of every

<P>I have been led into the&s;e reflections from accidently meet|ing, &s;ome days ago, a poor fellow, whom I knew when a boy, dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ailor's jacket, and begging at one of the outlets of the town, with a wooden leg. I knew him to be hone&s;t and indu&s;trious when in the country, and was curious to learn what had reduced him to his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Wherefore, after giving him what I thought proper, I de&s;ired to know the hi&s;tory of his life and misfortunes, and the manner in which he was reduced to his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. The di&s;abled &s;oldier, for &s;uch he was, though dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ailor's habit, &s;cratching his head, and leaning on his crutch, put him&s;elf in|to an attitude to comply with my reque&s;t, and gave me his hi&s;tory as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As for my misfortunes, ma&s;ter, I can't pretend to have
<PB N="131" REF="131">
gone through any more than other folks; for, except the lo&s;s of my limb, and my being obliged to beg, I don't know any rea&s;on, thank heaven, that I have to complain; there is Bill Tibbs, of our regiment, he has lo&s;t both his legs, and an eye to boot; but, thank heaven, it is not &s;o bad with me yet.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was born in Shrop&s;hire, my father was a labourer, and died when I was five years old; &s;o I was put upon the pari&s;h. As he had been a wandering &s;ort of a man, the pari&s;hioners were not able to tell to what pari&s;h I belonged, or where I was born, &s;o they &s;ent me to another pari&s;h, and that pari&s;h &s;ent me to a third. I thought in my heart, they kept &s;ending me about &s;o long, that they would not let me be born in any pa|ri&s;h at all; but, at la&s;t, however, they fixed me. I had &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition to be a &s;cholar, and was re&s;olved, at lea&s;t, to know my letters; but the ma&s;ter of the work-hou&s;e put me to bu|&s;ine&s;s as &s;oon as I was able to handle a mallet; and here I lived an ea&s;y kind of a life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true, I was not &s;uffered to &s;tir out of the hou&s;e, for fear, as they &s;aid, I &s;hould run away; but what of that? I had the liberty of the whole hou&s;e, and the yard be|fore the door, and that was enough for me. I was then bound out to a farmer, where I was up both early and late; but I ate and drank well, and liked my bu&s;ine&s;s well enough, till he died, when I was obliged to provide for my&s;elf; &s;o I was re|&s;olved to go and &s;eek my fortune.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In this manner I went from town to town, worked when I could get employment, and &s;tarved when I could get none: when happening one day to go through a field be|longing to a ju&s;tice of peace, I &s;py'd a hare cro&s;&s;ing the path ju&s;t before me; and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my &s;tick at it:&mdash;Well, what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away in triumph, when the ju&s;tice him&s;elf met me: he called me a poacher and a villain; and collaring me, de&s;ired I would give an account
<PB N="132" REF="132">
of my&s;elf: I fell upon my knees, begged his wor&s;hip's pardon, and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, feed, and generation; but, though I gave a very good account, the ju&s;tice would not believe a &s;yllable I had to &s;ay; &s;o I was indicted at &s;e&s;&s;ions, found guilty of being poor, and &s;ent up to London to Newgate, in order to be tran&s;ported as a vagabond.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"People may &s;ay this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in all my life. I had my belly full to eat and drink, and did not work at all. This kind of life was too good to la&s;t for ever; &s;o I was taken out of pri&s;on, after five months, put on board a &s;hip, and &s;ent off, with two hundred more, to the planta|tions. We had but an indifferent pa&s;&s;age, for, being all con|fined in the hold, more than a hundred of our people died for want of &s;weet air; and tho&s;e that remained were &s;ickly e|nough, God knows. When we came a&s;hore we were &s;old to the planters, and I was bound for &s;even years more. As I was no &s;cholar, for I did not know my letters, I was obliged to work among the negroes; and I &s;erved out my time, as in duty bound to do.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When my time was expired, I worked my pa&s;&s;age home, and glad I was to &s;ee Old England again, becau&s;e I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I &s;hould be indicted for a vagabond once more, &s;o did not much care to go down into the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobbs when I could get them.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was very happy in this manner for &s;ome time, till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then de&s;ired me to &s;tand. They belonged to a pre&s;s-gang: I was carried before the ju&s;tice, and, as I could give no account of my&s;elf, I had my choice left, whether to go on board a man of war, or li&s;t for a &s;oldier. I cho&s;e the latter; and, in this po&s;t of a gentleman, I &s;erved two campaigns in Flanders, was at the battles of Val and Fontenoy, and received
<PB N="133" REF="133">
but one wound, through the brea&s;t here; but the doctor of our regiment &s;oon made me well again.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When the peace came on I was di&s;charged; and, as I could not work, becau&s;e my wound was &s;ometimes trouble|&s;ome, I li&s;ted for a landman in the Ea&s;t-India company's &s;er|vice. I here fought the French in three pitched battles; and I verily believe, that, if I could read or write, our captain would have made me a corporal. But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion, for I &s;oon fell &s;ick, and &s;o got leave to return home again with forty pounds in my pocket. This was at the beginning of the pre&s;ent war, and I hoped to be &s;et on &s;hore, and to have the plea&s;ure of &s;pending my mo|ney; but the government wanted men, and &s;o I was pre&s;&s;ed for a &s;ailor before ever I could &s;et foot on &s;hore.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The boat&s;wain found me, as he &s;aid, an ob&s;tinate fellow: he &s;wore he knew that I under&s;tood my bu&s;ine&s;s well, but that I &s;hammed Abraham, merely to be idle; but, God knows, I knew nothing of &s;ea-bu&s;ine&s;s, and he beat me without con|&s;idering what he was about. I had &s;till, however, my forty pounds, and that was &s;ome comfort to me under every beat|ing; and the money I might have had to this day, but that our &s;hip was taken by the French, and &s;o I lo&s;t all.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Our crew was carried into Bre&s;t, and many of them died, becau&s;e they were not u&s;ed to live in a jail: but, for my part, it was nothing to me, for I was &s;ea&s;oned. One night, as I was &s;leeping on the bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me, for I always loved to lie well, I was awakened by the boat&s;wain, who had a dark lanthorn in his hand; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Jack,'</Q> &s;ays he to me, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'will you knock out the French centry's brains?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I don't care,"</Q> &s;ays I, &s;triving to keep my&s;elf awake, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if I lend a hand."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Then follow me,'</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'and I hope we &s;hall do bu&s;ine&s;s.'</Q> So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the cloaths I had, about my middle, and went with him to fight the Frenchmen. I hate the French becau&s;e they are &s;laves, and wear wooden &s;hoes.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="134">
<Q REND="inline">"Though we had no arms, one Engli&s;hman is able to beat five French at any time; &s;o we went down to the door, where both the centries were po&s;ted, and ru&s;hing upon them, &s;eized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence, nine of us ran together to the quay, and, &s;eizing the fir&s;t boat we met, got out of the harbour and put to &s;ea. We had not been here three days before we were taken up by the Dor&s;et privateer, who were glad of &s;o many good hands; and we con&s;ented to run our chance. However, we had not &s;o much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with the Pompadour privateer, of forty guns, while we had but twenty-three; &s;o to it we went, yard-arm and yard-arm. The fight la&s;ted for three hours, and I verily believe we &s;hould have taken the Frenchman, had we but had &s;ome more men left behind; but, unfortunately, we lo&s;t all our men ju&s;t as we were going to get the victory.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was once more in the power of the French, and I believe it would have gone hard with me, had I been brought back to Bre&s;t: but by good fortune, we were taken by the Viper. I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you, that, in that engagement, I was wounded in two places; I lo&s;t four fingers of the left hand, and my leg was &s;hot off. If I had had the good fortune to have lo&s;t my leg and u&s;e of my hand on board a king's &s;hip, and not aboard a privateer, I &s;hould have been entitled to cloathing and maintenance during the re&s;t of my life; but that was not my chance: one man is born with a &s;ilver &s;poon in his mouth, and another with a wooden ladle. However, ble&s;&s;ed be God, I enjoy good health, and will for ever love li|berty and Old England. Liberty, property, and Old Eng|land, for ever, huzza!"</Q></P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, he limped off, leaving me in admiration at his intrepidity and content; nor could I avoid acknowledging, that an habitual acquaintance with mi&s;ery &s;erves better than philo&s;ophy to teach us to de&s;pi&s;e it.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN BY THE OR|DINARY OF NEWGATE.</HEAD>
<P>MAN is a mo&s;t frail being, incapable of directing his &s;teps, unacquainted with what is to happen in this life; and perhaps no man is a more manife&s;t in&s;tance of the truth of this maxim, than Mr THE. CIBBER, ju&s;t now gone out of the world. Such a variety of turns of fortune, yet &s;uch a per&s;e|vering uniformity of conduct, appears in all that happened in his &s;hort &s;pan, that the whole may be looked upon as one re|gular confu&s;ion: every action of his life was matter of won|der and &s;urpri&s;e, and his death was an a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>This gentleman was born of creditable parents, who gave him a very good education, and a great deal of good learning, &s;o that he could read and write before he was &s;ixteen. How|ever, he early di&s;covered an inclination to follow lewd cour&s;es; he refu&s;ed to take the advice of his parents, and pur&s;ued the bent of his inclination; he played at cards on Sundays; called him&s;elf a gentleman; fell out with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ther and laundre&s;s; and, even in the&s;e early days, his father was frequently heard to ob&s;erve, that young THE.&mdash;would be hanged.</P>
<P>As he advanced in years, he grew more fond of plea&s;ure; would eat an ortolan for dinner, though he begged the guinea that bought it; and was once known to give three pounds for a plate of green pea&s;e, which he had collected over-night as charity for a friend in di&s;tre&s;s: he ran into debt with every body that would tru&s;t him, and none could build a &s;conce bet|ter than he: &s;o that, at la&s;t, his creditors &s;wore with one ac|cord, that THE.&mdash;would be hanged.</P>
<P>But, as getting into debt by a man who had no vi&s;ible means but impudence for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, is a thing that every reader is
<PB N="136" REF="136">
not acquainted with, I mu&s;t explain this point a little, and that to his &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>There are three ways of getting into debt; fir&s;t, by pu&s;h|ing a face; as thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You, Mr Lute&s;tring, &s;end me home &s;ix yards of that padua&s;oy, dammee; but, harkee, don't think I ever intend to pay you for it, dammee."</Q> At this, the mercer laughs heartily; cuts off the padua&s;oy, and &s;ends it home; nor is he, till too late, &s;urpri&s;ed to find the gentleman had &s;aid nothing but truth, and kept his word.</P>
<P>The &s;econd method of running into debt is called fineering; which is getting goods made up in &s;uch a fa&s;hion as to be unfit for every other purcha&s;er; and, if the trade&s;man refu&s;es to give them upon credit, then threaten to leave them upon his hands.</P>
<P>But the third and be&s;t method is called, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Being the good cu&s;tomer."</Q> The gentleman fir&s;t buys &s;ome trifle, and pays for it in ready-money; he comes a few days after with no|thing about him but bank-bills, and buys, we will &s;uppo&s;e, a &s;ixpenny tweezer-ca&s;e; the bills are too great to be changed, &s;o he promi&s;es to return punctually the day after, and pay for what he has bought. In this promi&s;e he is punctual, and this is repeated for eight or ten times, till his face is well known, and he has got, at la&s;t, the character of a good cu&s;tomer. By this means he gets credit for &s;omething con&s;iderable, and then never pays for it.</P>
<P>In all this, the young man who is the unhappy &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent reflections, was very expert; and could face, fineer, and bring cu&s;tom to a &s;hop with any man in England: none of his companions could exceed him in this; and his very com|panions at la&s;t &s;aid that THE.&mdash;would be hanged.</P>
<P>As he grew old, he grew never the better; he loved orto|lans and green pea&s;e, as before; he drank gravy-&s;oup when he could get it, and always thought his oy&s;ters ta&s;ted be&s;t when he got them for nothing, or, which was ju&s;t the &s;ame, when he bought them upon tick: thus the old man kept up the vices of the youth, and what he wanted in power, he made up
<PB N="137" REF="137">
by inclination; &s;o that all the world thought that old THE.&mdash;would be hanged.</P>
<P>And now, reader, I have brought him to his la&s;t &s;cene; a &s;cene where, perhaps, my duty &s;hould have obliged me to a&s;|&s;i&s;t. You expect, perhaps, his dying words, and the tender farewell he took of his wife and children; you expect an ac|count of his coffin and white gloves, his pious ejaculations, and the papers he left behind him. In this I cannot indulge your curio&s;ity; for, oh! the my&s;teries of fate, THE.&mdash;was drown'd!</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few &s;ubjects which have been more written upon, and le&s;s under&s;tood, than that of friend&s;hip; to follow the dictates of &s;ome, this virtue, in&s;tead of being the a&s;&s;uager of pain, becomes the &s;ource of every inconvenience. Such &s;peculati&s;ts, by expecting too much from friend&s;hip, di&s;&s;olve the connexion, and by drawing the bands too clo&s;ely, at length break them. Almo&s;t all our romance and novel wri|ters are of this kind; they per&s;uade us to friend&s;hips, which we find it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;u&s;tain to the la&s;t; &s;o that this &s;weet|ner of life under proper regulations, is, by their means, ren|dered inacce&s;&s;ible or unea&s;y. It is certain, the be&s;t method to cultivate this virtue is by letting it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, make it&s;elf; a &s;imilitude of minds or &s;tudies, and even &s;ometimes a diver&s;ity of pur&s;uits, will produce all the plea&s;ures that ari&s;e from it. The current of tenderne&s;s widens, as it proceeds; and two men imperceptibly find their hearts warm with good|nature for each other, when they were at fir&s;t only in pur&s;uit of mirth or relaxation.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip is like a debt of honour; the moment it is talked
<PB N="138" REF="138">
of, it lo&s;es its real name, and a&s;&s;umes the more ungrateful form of obligation. From hence we find, that tho&s;e who re|gularly undertake to cultivate friend&s;hip find ingratitude ge|nerally repays their endeavours. That circle of beings, which dependence gathers round us, is almo&s;t ever unfriendly; they &s;ecretly wi&s;h the term of their connexions more nearly equal; and, where they even have the mo&s;t virtue, are prepared to re&s;erve all their affections for their patron, only in the hour of his decline. Increa&s;ing the obligations which are laid upon &s;uch minds only increa&s;es their burthen; they feel them|&s;elves unable to repay the immen&s;ity of their debt, and their bankrupt hearts are taught a latent re&s;entment at the hand that is &s;tretched out with offers of &s;ervice and relief.</P>
<P>Plautinus was a man who thought that every good was to be bought from riches; and as he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great wealth, and had a mind naturally formed for virtue, he re&s;olved to ga|ther a circle of the be&s;t men round him. Among the number of his dependants was Mu&s;idorus, with a mind ju&s;t as fond of virtue, yet not le&s;s proud than his patron. His circum&s;tances, however, were &s;uch as forced him to &s;toop to the good offices of his &s;uperior, and he &s;aw him&s;elf daily among a number of others loaded with benefits and prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip. The&s;e, in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of the world, he thought it prudent to accept; but, while he gave his e&s;teem, he could not give his heart. A want of affection breaks out in the mo&s;t trifling in&s;tances, and Plautinus had &s;kill enough to ob&s;erve the minute&s;t actions of the man he wi&s;hed to make his friend. In the&s;e he ever found his aim di&s;appointed; for Mu&s;idorus claimed an exchange of hearts, which Plautinus, &s;olicited by a variety of claims, could never think of be&s;towing.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, that the re&s;erve of our poor proud man was &s;oon con&s;trued into ingratitude; and &s;uch indeed in the common acceptation of the world it was. Wherever Mu&s;ido|rus appeared, he was remarked as the ungrateful man; he had accepted favours, it was &s;aid, and &s;till had the in&s;olence to pretend to independance. The event, however, ju&s;tified
<PB N="139" REF="139">
his conduct. Plautinus, by mi&s;placed liberality, at length became poor, and it was then that Mu&s;idorus fir&s;t thought of making a friend of him. He flew to the man of fallen fortune, with an offer of all he had; wrought under his direction with a&s;&s;iduity; and by uniting their talents both were at length placed in that &s;tate of life from which one of them had former|ly fallen.</P>
<P>To this &s;tory, taken from modern life, I &s;hall add one more, taken from a Greek writer of antiquity:&mdash;Two Jewi&s;h &s;ol|diers, in the time of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, had made many campaigns together, and a participation of dangers at length, bred an union of hearts. They were remarked throughout the whole army, as the two friendly brothers; they felt and fought for each other. Their friend&s;hip might have continued, without interruption, till death, had not the good fortune of the one alarmed the pride of the other, which was in his promotion to be a Centurion under the famous John, who headed a particu|lar party of the Jewi&s;h malecontents.</P>
<P>From this moment their former love was converted into the mo&s;t inveterate enmity. They attached them&s;elves to oppo&s;ite factions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ought each other's lives in the conflict of ad|ver&s;e party. In this manner they continued for more than two years, vowing mutual revenge, and animated with an unconquerable &s;pirit of aver&s;ion. At length, however, that party of the Jews, to which the mean &s;oldier belonged, join|ing with the Romans, it became victorious, and drove John, with all his adherents, into the Temple. Hi&s;tory has given us more than one picture of the dreadful conflagration of that &s;uperb edifice. The Roman &s;oldiers were gathered round it; the whole temple was in flames, and thou&s;ands were &s;een a|mid&s;t them, within its &s;acred circuit. It was in this &s;ituation of things, that the now-&s;ucce&s;sful &s;oldier &s;aw his former friend, upon the battlements of the highe&s;t tower, looking round with horror, and ju&s;t ready to be con&s;umed with flames. All his former tenderne&s;s now returned; he &s;aw the man of his bo&s;om ju&s;t going to peri&s;h; and, unable to with&s;tand the impul&s;e,
<PB N="140" REF="140">
he ran &s;preading his arms, and crying out to his friend, to leap down from the top, and find &s;afety with him. The Centu|rion from above heard and obeyed, and, ca&s;ting him&s;elf from the top of the tower into his fellow &s;oldier's arms, both fell a &s;acrifice on the &s;pot; one being cru&s;hed to death by the weight of his companion, and the other da&s;hed to pieces by the great|ne&s;s of his fall.'</P>

<P>BOOKS, while they teach us to re&s;pect the intere&s;ts of others, often make us unmindful of our own; while they in|&s;truct the youthful reader to gra&s;p at &s;ocial happine&s;s, he grows mi&s;erable in detail; and, attentive to univer&s;al har|mony, often forgets that he him&s;elf has a part to &s;u&s;tain in the concert. I di&s;like therefore the philo&s;opher who de|&s;cribes the inconveniencies of life in &s;uch plea&s;ing colours that the pupil grows enamoured of di&s;tre&s;s, longs to try the charms of poverty, meets it without dread, nor fears its incon|veniencies till he &s;everely feels them.</P>
<P>A youth, who has thus &s;pent his life among books, new to the world, and unacquainted with man but by philo&s;ophic information, may be con&s;idered as a being who&s;e mind is fil|led with the vulgar errors of the wi&s;e; utterly unqualified for a journey through life, yet confident of his own &s;kill in the direction, he &s;ets out with confidence, blunders on with vanity, and finds him&s;elf at la&s;t undone.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t has learned from books, and then lays it down as a maxim, that all mankind are virtuous or vicious in exce&s;s; and he has been long taught to dete&s;t vice and love virtue: warm therefore in attachments, and &s;tedfa&s;t in enmity, he treats every creature as a friend or foe; expects from tho&s;e he loves unerring integrity, and con&s;igns his enemies to the reproach of wanting every virtue. On this principle he pro|ceeds; and here begins his di&s;appointments; upon a clo&s;er in&s;pection
<PB N="141" REF="141">
of human nature, he perceives, that he &s;hould have mo|derated his friend&s;hip, and &s;oftened his &s;everity; for he often finds the excellencies of one part of mankind clouded with vice, and the faults of the other brightened with virtue; he finds no character &s;o &s;anctified that has not its failings; none &s;o infamous, but has &s;omewhat to attract our e&s;teem; he be|holds impiety in lawn, and fidelity in fetters.</P>
<P>He now therefore, but too late, perceives that his regards &s;hould have been more cool, and his hatred le&s;s violent; that the truely wi&s;e &s;eldom court romantic friend&s;hip with the good, and avoid, if po&s;&s;ible, the re&s;entment even of the wicked: every moment gives him fre&s;h in&s;tances that the bonds of friend&s;hip are broken if drawn too clo&s;ely, and that tho&s;e whom he has treated with di&s;re&s;pect more than retaliate the injury; at length therefore he is obliged to confe&s;s, that he has declared war upon the vicious half of mankind, with|out being able to form an alliance among the virtuous to e|&s;pou&s;e his quarrel.</P>
<P>Our book-taught philo&s;opher, however, is now too far advanced to recede; and though poverty be the ju&s;t con&s;e|quence of the many enemies his conduct has created, yet he is re&s;olved to meet it without &s;hrinking: philo&s;ophers have de|&s;cribed poverty in mo&s;t charming colours; and even his va|nity is touched in thinking, he &s;hall &s;hew the world in him|&s;elf one more example of patience, fortitude, and re&s;ignation: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come then, O Poverty! for what is there in thee dreadful to the wi&s;e! Temperance, health, and frugality walk in thy train; cheerfulne&s;s and liberty are ever thy compani|ons. Shall any be a&s;hamed of thee of whom Cincinatus was not a&s;hamed? The running brook, the herbs of the field, can amply &s;atisfy nature; man wants but little, nor that little long. Come then, O Poverty! while kings &s;tand by and gaze with admiration at the true philo&s;opher's re&s;ignation."</Q></P>
<P>The godde&s;s appears; for Poverty ever comes at the call: but, alas! he finds her by no means the charming figure books
<PB N="142" REF="142">
and his own imagination had painted. As when an ea&s;tern bride, whom her friends and relations had long de&s;cribed as a model of perfection, pays her fir&s;t vi&s;it, the longing bride|groom lifts the veil to &s;ee a face he had never &s;een before; but in&s;tead of a countenance blazing with beauty like the &s;un, he beholds deformity &s;hooting icicles to his heart; &s;uch ap|pears Poverty to her new entertainer; all the fabric of enthu|&s;ia&s;m is at once demoli&s;hed, and a thou&s;and mi&s;eries ri&s;e upon its ruins; while contempt, with pointing finger, is foremo&s;t in the hideous proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The poor man now finds that he can get no kings to look at him while he is eating; he finds, that in proportion as he grows poor, the world turns its back upon him, and gives him leave to act the philo&s;opher in all the maje&s;ty of &s;olitude. It might be agreeable enough to play the philo&s;opher, while we are con&s;cious that mankind are &s;pectators; but what &s;ig|nifies wearing the ma&s;k of &s;turdy contentment, and mounting the &s;tage of re&s;traint, when not one creature will a&s;&s;i&s;t at the exhibition? Thus is he for&s;aken of men, while his fortitude wants the &s;atisfaction even of &s;elf-applau&s;e; for either he does not feel his pre&s;ent calamities, and that is natural in&s;en&s;ibility; or he di&s;gui&s;es his feelings, and that is di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<P>Spleen now begins to take up the man; not di&s;tingui&s;hing in his re&s;entments, he regards all mankind with dete&s;tation; and commencing man-hater, &s;eeks &s;olitude to be at liberty to rail.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that he who retires to &s;olitude, is either a bea&s;t or an angel: the cen&s;ure is too &s;evere, and the prai&s;e unmerited; the di&s;contented being, who retires from &s;ociety, is generally &s;ome good-natured man, who has begun life with|out experience, and knew not how to gain it in his intercour&s;e with mankind.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE REV. HENRY GOLDSMITH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that the friend&s;hip between us can acquire no new force from the ceremonies of a Dedication; and, perhaps, it demands an ex|cu&s;e thus to prefix your name to my attempts, which you decline giving with your own. But as a part of this poem was formerly written to you from Switzerland, the whole can now, with propriety, be only in&s;cribed to you. It will al|&s;o throw a light upon many parts of it, when the reader under&s;tands, that it is addre&s;&s;ed to a man, who, de&s;pi&s;ing fame and fortune, has re|tired early to happine&s;s and ob&s;curity, with an income of forty pounds a year.</P>
<P>I now perceive, my dear brother, the wi&s;dom of your humble choice. You have entered upon a &s;acred office, where the harve&s;t is great, and the labourers are but few; while you have left
<PB N="148" REF="146">
the field of ambition, where the labourers are many, and the harve&s;t not worth carrying away. But of all kinds of ambition, as things are now circum&s;tanced, perhaps that which pur&s;ues poeti|cal fame is the wilde&s;t. What from the increa&s;|ed refinement of the times, from the diver&s;ity of judgments produced by oppo&s;ing &s;y&s;tems of cri|tici&s;m, and from the more preval<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">t divi&s;ions of opinion influenced by party, the &s;tronge&s;t and happie&s;t efforts can expect to plea&s;e but in a very narrow circle.</P>
<P>Poetry makes a principal amu&s;ement among unpoli&s;hed nations; but in a country verging to the extremes of refinement, Painting and Mu&s;ic come in for a &s;hare. And as they offer the feeble mind a le&s;s laborious entertainment, they at fir&s;t rival Poetry, and at length &s;upplant her; they engro&s;s all favour to them&s;elves, and though but younger &s;i&s;ters, &s;eize upon the elder's birth|right.</P>
<P>Yet, however this art may be neglected by the powerful, it is &s;till in greater danger from the mi&s;taken efforts of the learned to improve it. What critici&s;ms have we not heard of late in fa|vour of blank ver&s;e, and Pindaric odes, cho|ru&s;&s;es, anape&s;ts and iambics, alliterative care and happy negligence! Every ab&s;urdity has now a champion to defend it, and as he is generally
<PB N="149" REF="147" MS="y">
much in the wrong, &s;o he has always much to &s;ay; for error is ever talkative.</P>
<P>But there is an enemy to this art &s;till more dan|gerous, I mean party. Party entirely di&s;torts the judgment, and de&s;troys the ta&s;te. A mind capable of reli&s;hing general beauty, when once infected with this di&s;ea&s;e, can only find plea&s;ure in what contributes to increa&s;e the di&s;temper. Like the tyger that &s;eldom de&s;i&s;ts from pur&s;uing man after having once preyed upon human fle&s;h, the reader, who has once gratified his appetite with calumny, makes, ever after, the mo&s;t agree|able fea&s;t upon murdered reputation. Such readers generally admire &s;ome half-witted thing, who wants to be thought a bold man, having lo&s;t the character of a wi&s;e one. Him they dig|nify with the name of poet; his lampoons are called &s;atires, his turbulence is &s;aid to be force, and his phrenzy fire.</P>
<P>What reception a poem may find, which has neither abu&s;e, party, nor blank ver&s;e to &s;upport it, I cannot tell, nor am I much &s;olicitous to know. My aims are right. Without e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of any party, I have attempted to mo|derate the rage of all. I have endeavoured to &s;hew, that there may be equal happine&s;s in other &s;tates, though differently governed from our own; that each &s;tate has a particular principle
<PB N="150" REF="148">
of happine&s;s, and that this principle in each &s;tate, and in our own in particular, may be carried to a mi&s;chievous exce&s;s. There are few can judge, better than your&s;elf, how far the&s;e po&s;itions are illu&s;trated in this poem.</P>

<HEAD>TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN have no expectations in an addre&s;s of this kind, either to add to your reputation, or to e&s;|tabli&s;h my own. You can gain nothing from my admiration, as I am ignorant of that art in which you are &s;aid to excel; and I may lo&s;e much by the &s;everity of your judgment, as few have a ju&s;ter ta&s;te in poetry than you. Setting intere&s;t therefore a&s;ide, to which I never paid much attention, I mu&s;t be indulged at pre&s;ent in following my affections. The only dedication I ever made was to my brother, becau&s;e I loved him better than mo&s;t other men. He is &s;ince dead. Permit me to in&s;cribe this Poem to you.</P>
<P>How far you may be plea&s;ed with the ver&s;i|cation and mere mechanical parts of this at|tempt, I don't pretend to enquire; but I know you will object (and indeed &s;everal of our be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t friends concur in the opinion) that the depopulation it deplores is no where to be &s;een, and the di&s;orders it laments are only to be found in the poet's own imagination. To this I can &s;carce make any other an&s;wer than that I &s;incere|ly believe what I have written; that I have taken all po&s;&s;ible pains, in my country excur&s;ions, for the&s;e four or five years pa&s;t, to be certain of
<PB N="168" REF="165">
what I alledge, and that all my views and enquiries have led me to believe tho&s;e mi&s;eries real, which I here attempt to di&s;play. But this is not the place to enter into an enquiry whether the country be depopulating or not; the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion would take up much room, and I &s;hould prove my&s;elf, at be&s;t, an indifferent politician, to tire the reader with a long preface, when I want his unfatigued attention to a long poem.</P>
<P>In regretting the depopulation of the country, I inveigh again&s;t the increa&s;e of our luxuries; and here al&s;o I expect the &s;hout of modern politi|cians again&s;t me. For twenty or thirty years pa&s;t, it has been the fa&s;hion to con&s;ider luxury as one of the greate&s;t national advantages; and all the wi&s;dom of antiquity in that particular, as er|roneous. Still, however, I mu&s;t remain a pro|fe&s;&s;ed ancient on that head, and continue to think tho&s;e luxuries prejudicial to &s;tates, by which &s;o many vices are introduced, and &s;o ma|ny kingdoms have been undone. Indeed, &s;o much has been poured out of late on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, that, merely for the &s;ake of novelty and variety, one would &s;ometimes wi&s;h to be in the right.</P>

<L>We &s;carcely can prai&s;e it, or blame it too much;</L>
<L>Who, born for the Univer&s;e, narrow'd his mind,</L>

<L>The pupil of impul&s;e, it forc'd him along,</L>
<L>His conduct &s;till right, with his argument wrong;</L>
<L>Still aiming at honour, yet fearing to roam,</L>
<L>The coachman was tip&s;y, the chariot drove home;</L>
<L>Would you a&s;k for his merits, alas! he had none,</L>

<L>Here Cumberland lies, having acted his parts,</L>
<L>The Terence of England, the mender of hearts;</L>
<L>A flattering painter, who made it his care</L>
<L>To draw men as they ought to be, not as they are;</L>
<L>His gallants are all faultle&s;s, his women divine,</L>
<L>And comedy wonders at being &s;o fine;</L>
<L>Like a tragedy queen he has dizen'd her out,</L>
<L>Or rather like tragedy giving a rout.</L>
<L>His fools have their follies &s;o lo&s;t in a crowd</L>
<L>Of virtues and feelings, that folly grows proud,</L>
<L>And coxcombs alike in their failings alone,</L>
<L>Adopting his portraits are pleas'd with their own.</L>
<L>Say, where has our poet this malady caught,</L>
<L>Or wherefore his characters thus without fault?</L>
<L>Say was it that vainly directing his view,</L>
<L>To find out mens virtues and finding them few,</L>
<L>Quite &s;ick of pur&s;uing each trouble&s;ome elf,</L>

<L>Come and dance on the &s;pot where your tyrant reclines,</L>

<L>Here lies David Garrick, de&s;cribe me who can,</L>
<L>An abridgment of all that was plea&s;ant in man;</L>
<L>As an actor, confe&s;t without rival to &s;hine,</L>
<L>As a wit, if not fir&s;t, in the very fir&s;t line;</L>
<L>Yet with talents like the&s;e, and an excellent heart,</L>
<L>The man had his failings, a dupe to his art;</L>
<L>Like an ill-judging beauty, his colours he &s;pread,</L>
<L>And beplai&s;ter'd, with rouge, his own natural red.</L>
<L>On the &s;tage he was natural, &s;imple, affecting,</L>
<L>'Twas only that, when he was off, he was acting:</L>
<L>With no rea&s;on on earth to go out of his way,</L>
<L>He turn'd and he varied full ten times a-day;</L>
<L>Tho' &s;ecure of our hearts, yet confoundedly &s;ick,</L>
<L>If they were not his own by fine&s;&s;ing and trick;</L>
<L>He ca&s;t off his friends, as a hunt&s;man his pack,</L>
<L>For he knew when he pleas'd he could whi&s;tle them back.</L>
<L>Of prai&s;e a mere glutton, he &s;wallow'd what came,</L>

<L>And &s;lander it&s;elf mu&s;t allow him good-nature:</L>
<L>He cheri&s;h'd his friend, and he reli&s;h'd a bumper;</L>

<L>Perhaps you may a&s;k if the man was a mi&s;er?</L>
<L>I an&s;wer, no, no, for he always was wi&s;er;</L>
<L>Too courteous, perhaps, or obligingly flat;</L>

<L>Here Reynolds is laid, and, to tell you my mind,</L>
<L>He has not left a wi&s;er or better behind:</L>
