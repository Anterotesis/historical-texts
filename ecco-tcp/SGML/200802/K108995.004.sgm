<HEAD>CHAP I. GENERAL STATE OF THE STAGE TO THE RE|STORATION.</HEAD>
<P>AS, in order to keep the life of every &s;eparate poet within the reader's view, I have found it impo&s;&s;ible to avoid going in &s;ome in&s;tances beyond the death of JAMES, &s;o upon the &s;ame principle I have kept back &s;everal authors who might with great propriety have been mentioned, had it not appeared nece&s;&s;ary that their whole writings &s;hould al&s;o be &s;een and ex|amined together.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on for my adoption of this conduct
<PB N="6" REF="4">
is that, though, as we come forwarder, it would be naturally expected that facts and circum&s;tances &s;hould wear a mo&s;t decided and defined a&s;pect, the impo&s;&s;ibility of this happens to be apparent; for the troubles of CHARLES, the fir&s;t, &s;o involved in doubt and uncertainty many particulars relative to the the|atre, that the early plays of SHIRLEY, BROME, and others, could not po&s;&s;ibly bear the dates we &s;ee affixed to them, and for the &s;imple rea&s;on that actors and playhou&s;es were at tho&s;e times prohibited.</P>
<P>We know that CHARLES the fir&s;t, who was taught mu&s;ic by COPERARIO, and dancing at the particular reque&s;t of his father, was very fond of dramatic amu&s;ements; but the&s;e were generally ma&s;ques; for plays dwindled after the death of SHAKESPEAR, which has been proved by the va|riety of enemies JONSON conjured up, mo&s;t of which attacked him &s;ucce&s;sfully; but, by the time PRYNNE, the COLLIER of his day, came to publi&s;h his &s;trictures, which, though he was a &s;acrifice, &s;erved the cau&s;e of the Puritans, the intere&s;t of the theatre was very materially &s;haken, and this was in 1633.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts admitted, no man in his &s;en&s;es, and with a correct knowledge of the &s;ubject, can venture to a&s;&s;ert that from the death of JONSON even to the
<PB N="7" REF="5">
Re&s;toration, many novelties, at lea&s;t of a regular and meritorious kind, could po&s;&s;ibly have been brought out; but, when you &s;ee the titles of plays that bear date all the way from the calling of the long parliament to the abdication of RICHARD CROM|WELL, nothing can be &s;o ab&s;urd as to believe that they were then produced; for during the troubles, not only the theatres were &s;hut up but the actors were nobly acting their parts, and that in mo&s;t ho|nourable &s;ituations, by defending their king in the field of battle; in which duty they acquitted them|&s;elves with &s;o much &s;pirit, courage, and loyalty, that but one malcontent appeared among them, and he, having &s;eceded only from religious motives, took no active part on either &s;ide. His name was SWANSTON.</P>
<P>As we hear nothing at this time of BURBAGE, HEMMINGS, and CONDELL, they had probably retired from this earthly &s;tage, for LOWIN, TAY|LER, and POLLARD, were &s;o old that, though they fervently gave the king their &s;incere&s;t good wi&s;hes, they had nothing better to offer for his &s;ervice. It was, however, different with tho&s;e who had &s;trength and were young enough to manife&s;t their more active duty.</P>
<P>MOHUN had fir&s;t a company and afterwards a
<PB N="8" REF="6">
majority; HART had a troop of hor&s;e in Prince RUPERT's regiment, under &s;ir THOMAS DALLISON; BURT was a cornet in the &s;ame troop, and SHAT|TERSEL a quarter ma&s;ter; ALLEN, of the Cockpit, was a major and quarter ma&s;ter general, and ROB|INSON, who had &s;ome important commi&s;&s;ion, was killed by that HARRISON who was hanged after|wards at Charing Cro&s;s, and who &s;urprized and &s;ur|rounded ROBINSON with a &s;trong party, which it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to cope with, and butchered him after he had lain down his arms, crying out,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cur&s;ed be he that doeth the work of the LORD negligently."</Q></P>
<P>So many others nobly fell in the cau&s;e of their &s;overeign that not more than enough to furbi&s;h up a tolerable company remained after the troubles, though LOWIN, TAYLER, and POLLARD, old as they were, made a part of it. The&s;e were obliged to perform by &s;tealth; and, though they contrived by &s;ome means to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Cockpit, they were not only obliged to invite their audiences with the greate&s;t privacy, but even to be cautious of whom tho&s;e audiences were compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Further to &s;et this clear, in October, 1647, and in February, 1648, ordinances were i&s;&s;ued from the long parliament, in which
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"all &s;tage plays and in|terludes
<PB N="9" REF="7">
were ab&s;olutely forbid. Stages, &s;eats, and galleries were ordered to be pulled down, and all players, though calling them&s;elves the king's or queen's &s;ervants, to be puni&s;hed as rogues and vagabonds; the money received at the doors to go to the poor of the pari&s;h, and every &s;pectator to pay five &s;hillings al&s;o for the u&s;e of the poor."</Q></P>
<P>The con&s;equence of being driven to this ne|ce&s;&s;ity is obvious, After being undi&s;turbed for a very &s;hort time, information was given again&s;t them; and, as they were performing The <HI>Bloody Brother,</HI> in which LOWIN acted Aubrey, TAYLER Rollo, POLLARD the cook, BURT Latorch, and HART Otto, a party of &s;oldiers &s;urprized them in the middle of the play and carried them off, habits and all, to Hatton Hou&s;e, from whence, after keep|ing them &s;ome time, they &s;tript them and let them loo&s;e again.</P>
<P>After this a few noblemen, who were not un|mindful of their merit and &s;ervices, invited the&s;e poor for&s;aken wretches to perform at their hou&s;es, and Holland Hou&s;e at Ken&s;ington, in particular was now and then fitted up for their reception. The actors, however, and their audiences were

<PB N="9" REF="9">

<PB N="10" REF="10">
obliged to be a little cautious, for both their pro|fe&s;&s;ion and their principles were of cour&s;e obnoxious to OLIVER and his party.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated they were obliged to keep a good look out; and GOFFE, who u&s;ed to perform the female parts, and who had a very &s;kilful and ani|mating addre&s;s, not only u&s;ed to plead their cau&s;e to their patrons and excite them to relieve their di&s;tre&s;s, but he bribed the officers and others who were commanded to watch over them, by which means they were now and then winked at, or el&s;e &s;o put upon their guard, that they knew how to get out of the way when the hue and cry was after them.</P>
<P>In addition to this precarious and humiliating way of picking up a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, they got to|gether old editions of plays and publi&s;hed them by &s;ub&s;cription, and this fact almo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hes a certainty that the plays dated at that time were ge|nerally reprints.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e plays, The <HI>Wild Goo&s;e Cha&s;e,</HI> by BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, was publi&s;hed in 1652, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for the public u&s;e,"</Q> &s;ays the title page,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of all the ingenious, and the private benefit of JOHN LOWIN, and JOSEPH TAYLER, &s;ervants to his
<PB N="11" REF="11">
late maje&s;ty, and by them dedicated to the ho|noured few lovers of dramatic poe&s;y."</Q></P>
<P>In the dedication they &s;o mode&s;tly de&s;cribed their wants, that the play &s;old very well; and, in &s;o many in&s;tances as the experiment was repeated, they found it turn tolerably to account, but not equal to their exigenices, and therefore, &s;uch as knew any thing of bu&s;ine&s;s endeavoured at e&s;tabli&s;h|ing them&s;elves. Being however a &s;et of pro&s;cribed characters, and what was wor&s;e, intolerably poor, it was difficult for them to know what calling to chu&s;e, and how to find capital to carry on bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>POLLARD was the riche&s;t among them, but he left them at length, at the in&s;tance of his relations in the country, where he died about 1658 at a very great age; LOWIN kept an inn at Brentford, called the Three Pigeons, and at length died very poor, and at lea&s;t as old as POLLARD. TAYLER was in &s;ome trifling bu&s;ine&s;s at RICHMOND, where he al&s;o died very old; and PERKINS and SUMNER, who followed &s;ome occupation together near Clerken|well, did not linger long after their companions.</P>
<P>Some of the re&s;t, as we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter, being younger men, &s;aw out the troubles and became the
<PB N="12" REF="12">
principal actors immediately after the Re&s;toration. HART, and others, notwith&s;tanding their adver&s;ity during CROMWELL's u&s;urpation, made fortunes in the reign of CHARLES the &s;econd.</P>
<P>There are many circum&s;tances related by which we are de&s;ired to credit that after the total pro|&s;cription of the theatre, which was in 1647, &s;uc|ce&s;sful attempts were made to bring it again into reputation. I cannot, however, in &s;pight of my in|clination to believe this, and my diligence to find it confirmed, &s;ee any rea&s;on for relying upon the&s;e reports, which are contradictory, many of them even to refutation. Sir WILLIAM DAVENANT at|tempted &s;ome kind of theatrical exhibition, a &s;hort time before the Re&s;toration, at Rutland Hou&s;e; and when the kingdom began to feel a glow of hope from the preparations of MONK, the &s;cattered remains of the players began to collect them&s;elves together.</P>
<P>At this time RHODES, a book&s;eller, who had been wardrobe keeper to the company at Black|friers, boldly &s;itted up the Cockpit at Drury Lane; and, in addition to tho&s;e who&s;e names we have already &s;een, retained BETTERTON, and KY|NASTON, who had both been his apprentices.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13">The theatrical &s;tandard was now hoi&s;ted, and another company &s;oon began to form at the Red Bull, and as this was during the &s;hort period be|tween the death of CROMWELL and the Re&s;toration, making about two years, it was very unlikely they met with any material &s;ucce&s;s, for the kingdom had not &s;ufficient lei&s;ure to pay them much attention.</P>
<P>It is, however, but fair to allow that they laid the foundation of what happened afterwards; and by having collected and dige&s;ted &s;omething like a regular plan, they were better prepared for action when a real opportunity took place; for RHODES's company with &s;ome additional actors compo&s;ed that &s;et who performed under &s;ir WILLIAM DAVE|NANT's patent; and the other made up the company of KILLICREW.</P>
<P>It will be little nece&s;&s;ary to attempt further proof that the theatre began to decline &s;o early as PRYNNE's attack on it in 1633, and that of cour&s;e no authors of any celebrity were or could be in|duced to a&s;&s;i&s;t it materially with their labours. This declen&s;ion augmented gradually till 1660; when all impediments being removed, when the players, and many of the authors, being ready to re&s;ume their functions, when it was not only the wi&s;h but
<PB N="14" REF="14">
the intere&s;t of the whole nation to laugh away the gloom in which it had been involved, two theatres were immediately e&s;tabli&s;hed, one by virtue of a patent granted to &s;ir WILLIAM DAVENANT, and another ve&s;ting the &s;ame right in HENRY KILLI|GREW, both grants being for ever.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE THEATRE AT THE RESTORATION.</HEAD>
<P>IF the merit of SHAKESPEAR and his cotemporaries maintained at lea&s;t eight theatres at a time, without the advantages of &s;cenes or actre&s;&s;es, one introduced to attract the view, and the other to charm the &s;en&s;es, there clearly mu&s;t have been a deplorable deficency in the dramatic productions at the Re&s;toration; when two theatres at a time made &s;o indifferent a &s;hift to get on, that in order to give &s;trength to their performances they united; and thus all the dra|matic merit of the kingdom was concentrated in one company.</P>
<P>The &s;teps that led to this union, which was not di&s;&s;olved till &s;even years after the Revolution, it will be now nece&s;&s;ary to trace. Under the patent granted to KILLIGREW, the actors were deno|minated the king's &s;ervants, and performed at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane; &s;ir WILLIAM
<PB N="16" REF="16">
DAVENANT's company were called the Duke's Servants, and they performed fir&s;t at Lincoln Inn Fields, and afterwards at the Duke's theatre in Dor&s;et Gardens.</P>
<P>About ten of the king's company were on his maje&s;ty's hou&s;ehold e&s;tabli&s;hment. They were allowed &s;carlet cloth and lace for their uniform, and were &s;tyled by the Lord Chamberlain, Gentlemen of the Grand Chamber. This di&s;tinction does not, however, appear to have been extended to the Duke's company. Both were greatly re&s;pected and carre&s;&s;ed at court, where, as well as at their re|&s;pective theatres, they frequently performed in the pre&s;ence of the royal family and the nobility.</P>
<P>Of &s;o much con&s;equence were they con&s;idered, and of &s;uch import to the &s;tate appeared their e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, that the code of theatrical regulations, which we have &s;een i&s;&s;ued by the command of LOUIS the fourteenth, and which de&s;erves every commendation, &s;eems if it had been copied from that of the Engli&s;h companies; for the court took cognizance of their private government; and when|ever there were any di&s;putes, either the king, or the duke, in per&s;on, conde&s;cended to decide on them.</P>
<P>But neither the renovation of the theatre after
<PB N="17" REF="17">
&s;o long an interdiction, the &s;cenes, or the actre&s;&s;es, were able to &s;atisfy the public without having re|cour&s;e to SHAKESPEAR; who&s;e plays, to prevent all po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;content, as well as &s;everal of JONSON's productions, and al&s;o MASSINGER's and FLETCHER's were in the mo&s;t &s;crupulous and im|partial manner divided between them; for it was a &s;trict &s;tanding regulation that no play performed at one hou&s;e &s;hould be acted at the other.</P>
<P>As the&s;e plays were cho&s;en in &s;uch a manner as an&s;wered the be&s;t purpo&s;es of both companies, the court not only ratified the choice but applauded their good &s;en&s;e in &s;teering &s;o impartially clear of each other. Thus while HART was celebrated in Othello, BETTERTON was famous in Hamlet.</P>
<P>I know not if this may be called a prudent me|thod; for, though too much emulation leads to &s;atiety, yet victory is gained by nobly &s;truggling, and compari&s;on is the criterion of excellence. At any rate is was not adopted by them to any good purpo&s;e; for DAVENANT finding his company weaken in the public e&s;timation, introduced what was then and is at this moment the di&s;grace and re|proach of the theatre<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that I mean to advance any thing like an a&s;&s;ertion that ornament and &s;cenery are not a very decorous and proper appendage to the theatre. Nothing but the extraordinary merit which we have examined both in authors and actors could po&s;&s;ibly have kept up the &s;tage to &s;uch a pitch of reputation as we have &s;een it in, una&s;&s;i&s;ted as it was by the&s;e advantages; and even the admirable productions of SHAKESPEAR mu&s;t naturally have re|ceived an augmented brilliancy from this auxiliary embelli&s;hment, not that they have altogether been &s;o expen&s;ive as a &s;ingle panto|mime. I only re&s;erve to my&s;elf a right to blame tho&s;e innovations in this way which have prevailed to the injury of the drama, and &s;hook the fair preten&s;ions of tragedy and comedy to the fir&s;t rank in the theatre. Go for ma&s;ques, go for operas, go for &s;pectacles if you will; let painting and mu&s;ic, tho&s;e becoming attendants on poetry, and the meritorious labours of their lovely &s;i&s;ter; but let them keep within their own province. Let us have magic and fairy land, and let fairies bring about the&s;e transformations to the belief of which our minds are accommodated: but do not &s;uffer &s;tuffed elephants, pa&s;te|board lyons, and leathern tygers to train the car of a real hero. Let us remember that the&s;e tricks were borrowed from our fanta&s;tic neigh|bours the French; and that, even in FRANCE, CORNEILLE with all his reputation never recovered the kick that was given to it by the nece&s;&s;ity he was under of courting an auxiliary in the Flying Hor&s;e.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="18">Operas and ma&s;ques took place of tragedies and comedies, and to PYSCHE and CIRCE yielded CLEOPATRA and ROSALIND. To &s;ee and to hear are one thing, and to think and to judge another, and nothing could more completely verify the truth of this then what had happened to the king's company upon DAVENANT's bringing forward the&s;e auxiliary helps; for, though they were compo&s;ed of per|formers much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the other, they
<PB N="19" REF="19">
in&s;tantly experienced the mo&s;t cold and mortifying neglect, while the hou&s;es and the coffers of the other hou&s;e were completely filled; nor did they ever perfectly recover their e&s;timation with the public, nor at all till they procured &s;cenery and decorations from FRANCE and attacked their op|ponents with their own weapons.</P>
<P>Another advantage which the &s;tage now began to boa&s;t was not only evidently nece&s;&s;ary but per|fectly rational. BURT, CLUN, HART, HAMMER|TON, and KYNASTON, had hitherto been famous for performing female characters, and their repu|tation is very highly &s;poken of; but, as &s;oon as Mrs. SAUNDERS, who afterwards married BETTER|TON, and Mrs. DAVENPORT began to appear, and the&s;e were followed by others of the names of DAVIES, LONG, GIBBS, NORRIS, HOLDEN, and JENNINGS, the theatre &s;eem to rennovate in earne&s;t, and &s;cenes of tenderne&s;s, at which every audience mu&s;t before have materially revolted, received now an additional force and energy by being graced with the real attractions of female beauty and feminine delicacy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was a clau&s;e, &s;ays an author, in one of the&s;e patents, but no doubt it was in both, which ran thus:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That whereas the womens' parts in plays have hitherto been acted by men in the habits of women, at which &s;ome have taken offence, we do permit and give leave, for the time to come, that all womens' parts be acted by women."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="20">In &s;pight of all the precautions that had been taken by the king and the duke of YORK to prevent theatrical di&s;putes this introduction of foreign mer|cenaries pre&s;ently introduced al&s;o cabals and in|trigues. Engli&s;hmen were not very well plea&s;ed at that in&s;olence which they experienced from French|men, or that nature and SHAKESPEAR &s;hould yield to a <HI>contre tems,</HI> or an <HI>entrechat</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A picture of tho&s;e times is given in pretty lively colours by an author who &s;eems to have known them well. He &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that though the town at the time of SHAKESPEAR was not by many degrees &s;o populous as then,"</Q>
meaning the reign of CHARLES the &s;econd,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"yet as better order was kept among tho&s;e who frequented plays their &s;ucce&s;s was more regular, and they them&s;elves as well as their productions were more re&s;pected; for,"</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as there was better order kept among the company that came, many people thought a play an innocent diver&s;ion for an idle hour or two, the plays them&s;elves being then more in&s;tructive and moral: whereas of late the playhou&s;es are &s;o extremely pe&s;tered with vizard ma&s;ks, and their trade occa&s;ioning continual quarrels and and abu&s;es, that many of the more civilized part of the town are unea&s;y in the company, and &s;hun the theatre as they would a hou&s;e of &s;candal. It is an argument of the worth of the plays and players of the la&s;t age, and ea&s;ily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">red that they were much be|yond ours in this, to con&s;ider that they could &s;upport them&s;elves merely from their own merit, the weight of the matter, and the goodne&s;s of the action, without &s;cenes or machines; whereas the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> plays, with all their &s;how, can hardly draw an audience, unle&s;s there be the additional invitation of a &s;ign or FIDELI, a mon&s;ieur l'ABBE or &s;uch &s;ome foreign re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">le expre&s;&s;ed in the bills."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="21">This was certainly the moment to attempt inno|vation with &s;ucce&s;s. A people who, in proportion as they had emancipated from gloom and &s;adne&s;s, were now plunging into every plea&s;ure, even to un|bridled licentiou&s;ne&s;s, were exactly the objects to be played on by pre&s;uming, cunning, and needy foreigners. Spectacle was the word; and, &s;o com|pletely did it prevail that at length the theatres them|&s;elves, yielding to the &s;uperior attractions of the puppet &s;hew in Sali&s;bury Court, were obliged to petition in the &s;ame manner as TERENCE com|plained in his time of the rope dancers in ROME.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e contentions, the public plea&s;ures of the people were &s;u&s;pended by their public calamities. The plague and the fire of LON|DON cau&s;ed a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of all amu&s;ements for eighteen months.</P>
<P>The&s;e events, however, having pa&s;&s;ed away as every calamity in that reign did like a cloud in April, the &s;un of plea&s;ure and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s &s;hone brighter than ever. New entertainments were in|vented, new auxiliaries called in, and this is the time when, as VOLTAIRE tells us, CAMBERT came
<PB N="22" REF="22">
over and
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"performed his dete&s;table mu&s;ic to the Engli&s;h, who thought it excellent."</Q></P>
<P>As it has been a good deal contended that de|corations and &s;cenes were not introduced on the Engli&s;h &s;tage till after the events of the plague, and the fire, it is worth while to notice that this cannot be the truth, but that it is exactly as I have here &s;tated. Sir WILLIAM DAVENANT was with the king in FRANCE, &s;o was KILLIGREW, and there cannot be a doubt but they availed them&s;elves of every fanciful dramatic decoration they &s;aw there; for, though they had not at that time arrived to CORELILLE's flying hor&s;e, the freaks of PERRIN, which, as we have &s;een, were the ruin of the marquis de SOURDEAC, mu&s;t no doubt have attracted the notice of CHARLES, and his followers; but &s;tronger circum&s;tance puts the matter out of doubt; for &s;ir WILLIAM DAVENANT did not live above a year and a half after the fire of LONDON, in which &s;hort period it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have carried &s;uch an improvement to any degree of perfection.</P>
<P>Le&s;t the circum&s;tance e&s;cape me I mu&s;t here beg that the reader will not confound the idea of THOMAS KILLIGREW with KILLIGREW the pa|tentee. The fir&s;t was a man of wit, and an ex|cellent companion for the king and ROCHESTER,
<PB N="23" REF="23">
and it was upon this account that it has been &s;up|po&s;ed in general that to him the patent was granted as manager of the king's company. This, however, certainly was not the ca&s;e, for all the authors agree that it was given to HENRY KILLIGREW, and there is no doubt but that the patent it&s;elf would bear out this fact, although it is extremely difficult to a&s;certain the real per&s;on after all; for we know of no HENRY KILLIGREW but doctor HENRY, who was the brother of THOMAS, and a year younger than that famous wit, whereas the patent was made out to HENRY KILLIGREW, e&s;quire.</P>
<P>It is certainly true that doctor HENRY KILLI|GREW was a man of brilliant talents, that he wrote a play, and that he was father of that Mrs. ANNE KILLIGREW on whom DRYDEN wrote a celebrated and beautiful elegy; and if it were not for the palpable mi&s;nomer, and al&s;o that not a &s;yllable has been hinted of the circum&s;tance by his numerous biographers, it would really be within likelihood that he was the per&s;on alluded to; for HART was the acting manager in the king's company, and BETTERTON in the duke's, &s;o that KILLIGREW and DAVENANT mu&s;t be con&s;idered only as pro|prietors.</P>
<P>The truth of this bu&s;ine&s;s will, perhaps, never

be known, which is indeed more extraordinary than material; but the rea&s;on &s;eems to be this. When the two companies in 1684 united, at which time the KLILIGREW, whoever he was, had perhaps died or withdrawn from the &s;cheme, for by this time there were &s;trange alterations, the plays were performed under &s;ir WILLIAM DAVENANT's patent which de&s;cended as regularly as a per&s;onal e&s;tate; having been bequeathed to doctor CHARLES DAVENANT, by him a&s;&s;igned to his brother ALEXANDER, who &s;old his intere&s;t in it to CHRISTOPHER RICH, a lawyer; from him it came to his &s;on, who left it to his four daughters, of whom it was purcha&s;ed by Mr. COLMAN and his friends, and it has never been denied that, with this patent and this intere&s;t, de|&s;cended al&s;o the dormant patent of KILLIGREW.</P>
<P>In a word, among all the hi&s;tories, of all the KILLIGREWS, we do not find a &s;ingle &s;yllable that directs us to the knowledge of which of them po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the patent; &s;o that the matter mu&s;t be left to the enquiry of the reader, who may, perhaps, not think the di&s;covery worth the pains.</P>
<P>Before &s;ir WILLIAM DAVENANT died, he began the theatre in Dor&s;et Garden, but did not live to &s;ee it fini&s;hed. It was opened in November, 1671, and on the following January, Drury Lane,
<PB N="25" REF="25">
belonging to the king's company, was burnt down together with more than fifty hou&s;es. Sir CHRISTO|PHER WREN was employed to renovate this phoenix; but there were &s;o many directors and dictators that he left the managers, who had by this time began to increa&s;e in number, and of cour&s;e in oppo&s;ition, to wrangle the matter out together; in con&s;equence of which his whole plan was mutilated and ruined, and every convenience and accommodation, intended by him for the advantage of the public and the per|formers, &s;poiled and de&s;troyed. It was, however, rebuilt and opened on the 26th of March, 1674.</P>
<P>Dor&s;et Garden, however, by means of &s;hew and parade, obtained a complete victory over Drury Lane, nature, and common &s;en&s;e. This induced the king's company, who were &s;everely galled at &s;uch unmerited preference, to attempt at many ex|pedients to revenge them&s;elves; and, among the re&s;t, authors were employed to parody and turn into ri|dicule the &s;pectacles of the other hou&s;e; which, as they could not excel them in &s;plendour and &s;hew, for otherwi&s;e the more non&s;en&s;e the better, not only rendered all their attempts abortive, but fixed an in|delible &s;tigma upon them for having malevolently dared to que&s;tion the jugdment of the public.</P>
<P>It has, by &s;ome of the writers on the &s;tage, been
<PB N="26" REF="26">
mentioned that BETTERTON belonged to the king's company; and, when &s;ir WILLIAM DAVENANT produced &s;cenes, that he went over to FRANCE to procure others more &s;plendid in order to oppo&s;e him; nay, &s;ome will have it that BETTERTON pro|duced all the &s;cenes. The fact is, BETTERTON went to FRANCE, at the expre&s;s command of the king, to try, by a review of the French theatre, to add every po&s;&s;ible improvement to the Engli&s;h; &s;o that the&s;e &s;cenes and decorations, which were really after the fire of LONDON, improved the duke's theatre &s;o materially, that it greatly contributed to the downfall of their opponents.</P>
<P>We have here to lament that BETTERTON, who&s;e own reputation was &s;urely much more in|volved with that of SHAKESPEAR, than &s;ignor FI|DELE, of whom LANGBAINE very properly &s;peaks &s;o contemptuou&s;ly, could &s;o far conde&s;cend to in|jure the real intere&s;t of the theatre as to become an encourager of this folly; but we have &s;een the be&s;t actors and the wi&s;e&s;t managers bend to the fa&s;hion of the times, and however reprehen&s;ible might be the conduct of BETTERTON, the ab&s;urdity of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors has lo&s;t him little to blu&s;h at.</P>
<P>Though the performers at KILLIGREW's theatre had been acknowledged upon the whole as the be&s;t,
<PB N="27" REF="27">
another rea&s;on why BETTERTON was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been one of them, they, about this time, dwindled con&s;iderably. Some had quitted the &s;tage, &s;ome had died, and the remainder were old and infirm. It was at this favourable moment that BETTERTON, full of anxiety to provide comfortably for his comrades, propo&s;ed to unite the theatres, which union was at length effected. They now performed by the title of the king's &s;ervants under &s;ir WILLIAM DAVENANT's patent, and after this time the patent of KILLIGREW does not &s;eem to have been called into action.</P>
<P>HART &s;oon after this retired, and MOHUN died; and now the theatre, in&s;tead of bringing a number of general intere&s;ts into one point of view, grew di&s;tracted with its inte&s;tine broils. The particulars of the&s;e, however, we are not yet ripe for; I &s;hall, therefore, leave the &s;tage for the pre&s;ent, to examine into the merits of tho&s;e men by whom it became celebrated.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. DAVENANT, SHIRLEY, AND RANDOLPH.</HEAD>
<P>AS the authors now became not only more nu|merous but more generally known, it will be &s;uffi|cient for me to detail the mo&s;t material particulars relative to them that I have been able to collect. Men of con&s;iderable talents certainly lived in the reign of CHARLES the &s;econd, one of them may with ju&s;tice be called our greate&s;t poet, but the air of Engli&s;h ta&s;te at that time was too gro&s;s, too de|leterious for the exi&s;tence of refined unadulterated wit, the in&s;tructor of morality, and the friend of virtue. Brutal and licentious je&s;ts a&s;&s;umed the whole dominion of letters; &s;lattery was a virtue, decency a reproach; and the &s;ure&s;t way of procuring favour and protection was to pro&s;titute tho&s;e en|dowments which were intended by nature and rea&s;on to delight and in&s;truct mankind.</P>
<P>Sir WILLIAM DAVENANT, to who&s;e indu&s;try
<PB N="29" REF="29">
and per&s;everence, the &s;tage has many obligations, led a life chequered with various fortunes. He was the &s;on of JOHN DAVENANT, a con&s;iderable vint|ner, who kept the Crown at OXFORD; and, as SHAKESPEAR very frequently called there in his journey from LONDON to WARWICKSHIRE, a curious report has prevailed that having been plea&s;ed to &s;hew great attention to the young vintner when a child, &s;ir WILLIAM owed not only his &s;ucce&s;s to our great bard's in&s;tructions, but his being to his gallantry.</P>
<P>Other circum&s;tances were adduced to corro|borate this report, and among them it was &s;aid that SHAKESPEAR was his godfather, and that he was chri&s;tened WILLIAM. Nay, he was &s;aid to re|&s;emble him very &s;trongly in every feature, but par|ticularly about the no&s;e; but this fact was after|wards left undecided, for &s;ir WILLIAM, having un|fortunately lo&s;t his no&s;e, that evidence of SHAKES|PEAR's incontinence was removed out of the way.</P>
<P>This report, however, has never been credited, which as it was invidious is rather wonderful, for it has been decided that Mrs. DAVENANT was a wo|woman of unblemi&s;hed reputation, and that all SHAKESPEAR's civility and attention were no more
<PB N="30" REF="30">
than a tribute of friend&s;hip and re&s;pect to her hu&s;band, for whom he had a high opinion and regard.</P>
<P>In whatever way we con&s;ider this gentleman's life, &s;omething that be&s;peaks extraordinary talents will be found in it. His genius &s;oaring above the trammels of the univer&s;ity, he quitted it very early and went to FRANCE in the &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">e of the duche&s;s of RICHMOND; afterwards he was retained by that unfortunate lord BROOK, who&s;e life we have &s;een, and who&s;e cruel death left our poet without a patron.</P>
<P>He now turned his mind to literature; and, when JONSON died, became a &s;ucce&s;sful candidate again&s;t MAY for the vacant laurel. This trait of favour and attention from the king he never forgot, for when the troubles began he artfully and &s;uc|ce&s;sfully &s;tirred up the people in his behalf, and in con&s;equence of his loyal conduct, which was fol|lowed up by great per&s;onal bravery, he received the honour of knighthood on the field of battle at the &s;iege of GLOCESTER.</P>
<P>He contined firmly and honourably devoted to the king, and was at length taken pri&s;oner and con|fined
<PB N="31" REF="31">
in COWES ca&s;tle; but nothing could conquer that firmne&s;s which was the marking feature of his character. So far from his being appalled with the pro&s;pect of death which &s;eemed to look him full in the face, he worked on his celebrated poem of <HI>Gondibert,</HI> two books of which he had written in FRANCE. At length two aldermen of YORK to|wards whom he had conducted him&s;elf with the true&s;t clemency when they were pri&s;oners and in his power, exerted their influence to &s;ave him, and he was &s;oon after at large.</P>
<P>We have &s;een that at the Re&s;toration he became manager of the duke of YORK's company; I &s;hall, therefore, examine into the merits of tho&s;e dramatic pieces which, previous to that event, at, and after it, gave his name a con&s;iderable con&s;equence as a dra|matic writer. As the&s;e pieces, however, were in general rather fitted to the &s;tage than written for it, and as, in con&s;equence, they are none of them upon the li&s;t of acting plays, the intelligence we get con|cerning them is very blind and uncertain; and, were it not for LANGBAINE, with whom DAVENANT &s;eems to have been a great favourite, we &s;hould be almo&s;t in the dark upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>Albovine, King of the Lombards,</HI> bears date 1629. It is doubtful at what place this play was performed,
<PB N="32" REF="32">
but it is taken from a novel by BANDELLO, and was dedicated to the duke of SOMERSET, and the dedication was followed up by eight copies of com|mendatory ver&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Cruel Brother,</HI> 1730, &s;aid to have been per|formed at Blackfriers, but we know nothing of either its origin or &s;ucce&s;s. The <HI>Ju&s;t Italian,</HI> 1730, of this play there is no further account than that it was performed at Blackfriers and introduced by ver&s;es written by HOPKINS and CAREW. The <HI>Temple of Love,</HI> 1634. Let it be remembered that I vouch for no dates between 1633 and 1660. This was a ma&s;que and contradicts the account that &s;cenes were not known till the Re&s;toration, for the author him&s;elf has the&s;e words:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This ma&s;que, for the invention, variety of &s;cenes, aparitions and rich|ne&s;s of habits, was generally approved to be one of the mo&s;t magnificent that had been done in ENGLAND."</Q>
The fact is &s;cenes were known before, for they were introduced by INIGO JONES; but they were too expen&s;ive to be exhibited any where but at court.</P>
<P><HI>Triumphs of the Prince d'Amour,</HI> was another piece of the &s;ame kind, the mu&s;ic was compo&s;ed by HENRY and WILLIAM LAWES. The <HI>Platonic Lovers,</HI> 1636, performed at Blackfriers. Very little
<PB N="33" REF="33">
is &s;aid about this piece, and it is probable that its &s;ucce&s;s was very indifferent, for it was not printed &s;ingly but waited for a play called The <HI>Wits</HI> to in|duce its &s;ale.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wits</HI> performed at Blackfriers in the &s;ame year. This play, which was taken from BEAU|MONT and FLETCHER's <HI>Wit at &s;everal Weapons,</HI> had con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s, and was afterwards revived at the duke's theatre. It is highly complimented by CAREW; <HI>Britannia Triumphant,</HI> and <HI>Salmacida Spolia,</HI> were ma&s;ques. The <HI>Unfortunate Lovers,</HI> was a tragedy, &s;o was <HI>Love and Honour,</HI> which la&s;t was performed with good &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e pieces, whatever was the exact time of their fir&s;t appearance, are all that DAVENANT pro|duced till 1656, at which time, as we have &s;een, he got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Rutland Hou&s;e, where he contrived a &s;pectacle by declamation, as he calls it, after the manner of the ancients, and afterwards he brought out the <HI>Siege of Rhodes</HI> there, which was certainly the fir&s;t attempt to introduce &s;cenes into a common theatre, for the title runs thus:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The <HI>Siege of Rhodes,</HI> made a repre&s;entation by the art of per&s;pective in &s;cenes, and the &s;tory
<PB N="34" REF="34">
&s;ung in recitative mu&s;ic, at the back part of Rut|land Hou&s;e, in the upper end of Alder&s;gate Street, LONDON, 1656."</Q>
With this play DAVENANT opened his theatre after the Re&s;toration, and it was warmly applauded. The event happened in the reign of SOLYMAN the &s;econd, and the &s;tory is well calculated to be conveyed through the medium of &s;cenery and decoration.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru,</HI> and The <HI>Hi&s;tory of Sir Francis Drake,</HI> were pieces performed at the Cockpit in 1658, and expre&s;&s;ed, as it was termed, by in&s;trumental and vocal mu&s;ic. The&s;e plays might have been &s;uffered but they were not, properly &s;peaking, permitted, and the accounts are that they would not have been &s;uffered at all had not OLIVER CROMWELL in the fir&s;t of them found &s;omething that plea&s;ed him wonderfully; for that it gave him a clue to atchieve &s;ome conque&s;ts that he had meditated again&s;t PERU him&s;elf. This is a &s;trange a&s;&s;ertion, and therefore I advi&s;e my readers to believe as much of it as reflection permits them to credit.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rivals,</HI> performed in 1668, is little more than attributed to DAVENANT. It was performed at his theatre, and is merely an alteration of FLETCHER's <HI>Noble Kin&s;men.</HI> The <HI>Man's the Ma&s;ter,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="35">
1669, is exactly the &s;ubject of SCARRON's <HI>Jodelet,</HI> and a mixture of <HI>L'Heritier Ridicule,</HI> and this will &s;hew that DAVENANT was determined to con|vince the public he was a good purveyor for their plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fair Favourite,</HI> a tragi comedy, 1673. The &s;ucce&s;s of this piece is not known, but <HI>Law again&s;t Lovers</HI> became very popular, and no wonder, for it was made up of SHAKESPEAR's <HI>Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure,</HI> and <HI>Much ado about Nothing.</HI> DAVENANT how|ever has not done any &s;ervice to either of the&s;e plays, and, as if he had not mutilated them enough by cutting them into one, he has affected to poli&s;h the language. In &s;hort it &s;ucceeded, which was natural enough, for the audience were glad to &s;ee the re&s;emblance of SHAKESPEAR in any dre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>News from Plymouth,</HI> 1673, according to LANG|BAINE, was performed with good &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>A Play|hou&s;e to Let,</HI> is a &s;trange farago, intended for no other purpo&s;e than to gather up all tho&s;e materials which were performed by &s;tealth in the time of CROMWELL. The&s;e to&s;&s;ed up with a kind of an in|troductory fir&s;t act, make an entertainment certainly full of variety but as certainly full of ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>To throw with &s;ucce&s;s MOLIERE's <HI>Cocu Ima|ginaire,</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="36">
The <HI>Hi&s;tory of Sir Francis Drake,</HI> The <HI>Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru,</HI> and The <HI>Actions of Cae&s;ar, Antony and Cleopatra,</HI> into one play is as &s;trong an in&s;tance of an author's courage and the &s;orbearance of an audience as I believe can be adduced; but to &s;uch reputation were mu&s;ic and &s;cenery arrived that the ab&s;urder the vehicle the higher the admiration; for, be&s;ides the incompre|hen&s;ible CAMBERT, they by this time began to have a ta&s;te for LULLY.</P>
<P>The next piece of this author called The <HI>Siege,</HI> is &s;o little remembered that no account can be ga|thered either of its merit or its &s;ucce&s;s. Its date is 1673, &s;o is that of another piece called <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> of which play we know as little as to its public ce|lebrity. An alteration of <HI>Macbeth</HI> adapted to the &s;pirit of the times, and decorated with &s;cenery and mu&s;ic, was the la&s;t attempt of this author, which bears the date of 1674; and, at &s;ome time in his life, he altered the <HI>Tempe&s;t,</HI> that it might have the &s;ame &s;tage advantages, in conjunction with DRYDEN.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances it appears, from the plays them&s;elves, that their dates were at the time they were printed, and their &s;ucce&s;s &s;uch as might be expected from the labours of a man who&s;e &s;tudy
<PB N="37" REF="37">
was rather to keep a plea&s;ing variety for the &s;tage, as a manager, than to become a candidate for public fame as an author; and this will apply, trace the merit of DAVENANT how you may; for he wrote well, &s;trong and readily; the &s;terling materials, therefore, that were nece&s;&s;ary to work up plays when they were obliged to go alone were u&s;ele&s;s now they were either dandled or trained in leading &s;trings; and nothing can prove this more forcibly than a peru&s;al of tho&s;e of his plays that are extant, which are none of them by any means regular, and which are fitted to the &s;tage even more ha&s;tily and &s;lovenly than tho&s;e of DRYDEN.</P>
<P>DAVENANT neverthele&s;s wrote &s;en&s;ibly and meritoriou&s;ly, but his be&s;t talents were not for the &s;tage, and there is more intrin&s;ic value in his <HI>Gondi|bert</HI> than all his dramatic productions put together. DRYDEN &s;peaks of him as one who had a quick fancy, and an imagination equal to the accompli&s;h|ment of every thing he projected. He &s;ays that no &s;ubject could be propo&s;ed to him on which he would not &s;uddenly produce a thought extremely plea&s;ant and &s;urprizing. WALLER, COWLEY, and HOBBS, wrote al&s;o highly in favour of his works. In &s;hort, he was a man of &s;trong intellects, and ex|tremely proper for the &s;ituation he held; which would have been manife&s;t more to his honour had
<PB N="38" REF="38">
not a fal&s;e ta&s;te an&s;wered his purpo&s;e, and, there|fore, he would have been his own worldly enemy to have had recour&s;e to real ta&s;te, but at la&s;t with all his ingenuity he would have cut but an indifferent figure by the &s;ide of even the &s;econd rate cla&s;s of dramatic poets in the reign of JAMES the fir&s;t, who had nothing to depend upon but intrin&s;ic merit.</P>
<P>SHIRLEY was a much better dramatic writer than &s;ir WILLIAM DAVENANT; which opinion &s;ome of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have &s;o &s;teadily held that with|out &s;cruple, in the fond imagination that they were following the dictates of their own fancy, they have followed him word for word. Mrs. BEHN, BUL|LOCK, and FOOTE, have taken materials from him; and even DRYDEN has given no mean account of him.</P>
<P>SHIRLEY, like WEBSTER was a writer of plays, and a &s;choolma&s;ter, but he had much more merit at either profe&s;&s;ion. According as the times were peaceable or turbulent, he pur&s;ued one or the other of the&s;e occupations. Some of his plays were pro|duced &s;oon after the death of JAMES the fir&s;t, but their &s;ucce&s;s does not appear to have been equal to their merit till they were brought forward at the Re|&s;toration. He did not, however, live long enough to reap any &s;olid advantages from this revival of his
<PB N="39" REF="39">
reputation; for, having been burnt out with his fa|mily at the dreadful fire in 1666, both he and his wife were &s;o &s;eized with terror at the &s;hocking event that they died within the &s;pace of four and twenty hours, and were buried in the &s;ame grave.</P>
<P>SHIRLEY's dramatic works are &s;aid to have been printed according to the following dates. The <HI>Wedding,</HI> 1629, was performed at the Phoenix. This play is well &s;poken of, and was twice revived with &s;ucce&s;s. The <HI>Grateful Servant,</HI> 1630, which is &s;aid to have been greatly applauded, was accom|panied by eight copies of ver&s;es, two of them written in Latin. This comedy was revived twice, but its reception was not perhaps equal to SHIR|LEY's expectation, for he took the principal circum|&s;tance in it to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the plot of the <HI>Humourous Courtier.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>School of Compliment,</HI> though brought out third was written fir&s;t. Its date is 1631, and it does not &s;eem to have been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as either of the others. The <HI>Changes,</HI> 1632, was greatly &s;uc|ce&s;sful, both during the author's life time and after his death, till DRYDEN took a principal circum|&s;tance into his <HI>Maiden Queen;</HI> which, not being liked as he introduced it, the innocent, as we fre|quently
<PB N="40" REF="40">
&s;ee in life, &s;uffered for being in company with the guilty.</P>
<P><HI>Contention for Honour and Riches,</HI> and The <HI>Triumph of Peace,</HI> were ma&s;ques, and had &s;ucce&s;s through the medium of decoration. The <HI>Witty Fair One,</HI> 1633, has merit, but its reception did not an&s;wer the author's hopes or expectations. Of the <HI>Bird in the Cage,</HI> al&s;o in 1633, we have different re|ports. It had great &s;ucce&s;s on the &s;tage, and was revived with the highe&s;t approbation on its being printed, not only on account of the play it&s;elf but an ironical dedication to the famous PRYNNE, who&s;e attack on the theatre we have gone through the hi&s;tory of. It is a &s;ingular &s;tory and &s;trangely con|ducted, but tho&s;e who read it will find in it &s;ome &s;terling materials.</P>
<P>The <HI>Traytor,</HI> which is little more than a judi|cious alteration of a piece under the &s;ame title written by one RIVERS, a Je&s;uit, was performed in 1635, and revived in 1692, as well as twenty-&s;ix years afterwards with alterations by BULLOCK, but it never did much; indeed tragedy was not the forte of SHIRLEY.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lady of Plea&s;ure,</HI> 1637. This play is not
<PB N="41" REF="41">
remarkable for any &s;triking merit, for on the con|trary it is full of indecency; but this was the vice of the times, and SHIRLEY, not content with intro|ducing the circum&s;tance of a man's enjoying the per&s;on of a young lady and fancying her the devil, in his <HI>Grateful Servant,</HI> which, as we have &s;een, was recommended by eight copies of ver&s;es, has brought it forward again in this piece. Mrs. BEHN, however, anxious to make her own &s;ex as knowing as po&s;&s;ible, has again ha&s;hed up this turtle with the addition of a little green &s;at, in her play of the <HI>Lucky Chance.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Young Admiral,</HI> 1637, performed at a private hou&s;e in Drury Lane, is a play of very me|diocre pretentions. The <HI>Example,</HI> &s;ame year. This is a tragi comedy as well as the la&s;t, and like that it has but a faint title to commendation. <HI>Hyde Park,</HI> 1637 again. We get at SHIRLEY's genuis be&s;t when we get to his comedies. This play, though far from a perfect performance, has many fla&s;hes of excellent humour, but it is irregular and undra|matic; and, like almo&s;t the whole of this author's works, requires to be regulated by a ma&s;terly hand. In &s;hort, there is too much of FLETCHER about SHIRLEY to en&s;ure him a permanent reputation.</P>
<P>His next comedy, The <HI>Game&s;ter,</HI> is a &s;trong
<PB N="42" REF="42">
proof of this. The plot, though perfectly natural, is full of perplexity, but there are parts of it that would do credit to any author. The characters are &s;trong, and the moral is intere&s;ting. This play was altered by CHARLES JOHNSON, and called The <HI>Wi&s;e's Relief,</HI> but his language does not mix well with SHIRLEY's. GARRICK, who better under|&s;tood the &s;tage, brought it forward under the title of The <HI>Game&s;ters,</HI> but he omitted certainly the two &s;tronge&s;t written &s;cenes in the whole play, and thus it has never yet been properly altered; if it were to be, there can be no doubt but it would keep a re&s;pectable &s;tand among the &s;tock li&s;t.</P>
<P>We next find two tragi-comedies, one called The <HI>Royal Ma&s;ter,</HI> and the other The <HI>Duke's Mi&s;tre&s;s.</HI> The fir&s;t had ten copies of complimentry ver&s;es per|fixed to it, though it had a &s;hort exi&s;tence, and the other &s;neaked out of the world without being noticed at all. The <HI>Maid's Revenge</HI> is &s;aid to have been SHIRLEY's &s;econd play, and indeed there is every appearance of it, for it is a very puerile performance. <HI>Chabot, Admiral of France,</HI> is a work of but little merit. The&s;e four la&s;t plays bear date 1638.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ball.</HI> A play in which SHIRLEY is &s;aid to have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by GEORGE CHAPMAN. <HI>Arcadia.</HI> This play is founded on &s;ir PHILIP SIDNEY's <HI>Ar|cadia,</HI>

a poem incapable of being dramatized; and, as if it was not dull and perplexed enough in SHIR|LEY's attempt to bring it on the &s;tage, it has been &s;ince done into a tragedy by a Mr. MACNAMARA MORGAN; and though &s;tuffed with the mo&s;t con|temptible mixture of puerility and bomba&s;t, had &s;ucce&s;s through the acting of BARRY and Mi&s;s NOSSITER.</P>
<P>The <HI>Humourous Courtier</HI> was performed with good &s;ucce&s;s. Whoever &s;earches for SHIRLEY's merit will find it in comedy. The <HI>Opportunity.</HI> There is a re&s;emblance in this play of <HI>Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure,</HI> and other &s;tories. It is not the be&s;t play of this author, but it is far from a bad one.</P>
<P><HI>St. Patrick for Ireland</HI> is a hi&s;torical play; but it only contains a part of the &s;tory, and is in other re&s;pects a loo&s;e and unintere&s;ting performance. In <HI>Love's Cruelty,</HI> a tragedy, there is not much to boa&s;t of. The &s;trange circum&s;tance of a hu&s;band's con|cealing his wife's adultery is too revolting. The <HI>Con&s;tant Maid</HI> is a comedy that contains much plea|&s;antry, but there is very little novelty in the inci|dents or the author's management of them. The &s;even la&s;t pieces bear date 1640.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coronation,</HI> which was &s;aid to have been
<PB N="44" REF="44">
written &s;ingly by FLETCHER, is al&s;o dated 1640. SHIRLEY laid claim to it, and his claim was allowed. It is not very material, however, who wrote it, ex|cept for the merit of particular pa&s;&s;ages, for as a play it has not much to boa&s;t of. The <HI>Triumph of Beauty</HI> is a ma&s;que, which was performed for the amu&s;ement of &s;ome young noblemen. The &s;ubject is the <HI>Judgment of Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Brothers.</HI> This &s;ubject, which has been treated repeatedly ever &s;ince TERENCE, cannot fail to &s;ucceed according to the merit of the different authors who choo&s;e it; and, whether we in&s;tance this play, the <HI>Squire of Al&s;atia, Tom Jones,</HI> the <HI>School for Scandal,</HI> or any other of tho&s;e numerous pro|ductions, either plays or novels, into which the e&s;|&s;ence of this &s;ubject has been introduced, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t pardonable plagiary that can be, becau&s;e the intere&s;t is affecting and always in nature.</P>
<P>The <HI>Si&s;ters.</HI> There are four or five French things, which have a re&s;emblance to this comedy. SHIRLEY's play has merit in parts, but is not well hung together, and, therefore, the intere&s;t palls. The <HI>Doubtful Heir</HI> is another of tho&s;e mixtures of merit and defect which we perpetually find in this author. You always pity him for making FLETCHER
<PB N="45" REF="45">
his model. The <HI>Impo&s;tor</HI> is fairly critici&s;ed by the &s;ame ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cardinal</HI> is a tragedy. Its &s;ucce&s;s we have no information of, but in the clo&s;et we ea&s;ily di&s;|cover what it ought to have been. It creates but little intere&s;t, and is upon the whole, in &s;pight of &s;ome good writing, a very dull thing. One has ground to &s;u&s;pect that many of the&s;e plays were not produced at the time they were &s;aid to have been performed. We perceive this in the next play of this author, called The <HI>Court Secret,</HI> which was intended to have been performed but was interdicted.</P>
<P><HI>Cupid and Death.</HI> This is a ma&s;que, and every body knows that the &s;ubject mu&s;t be the changing of their arrows. We are told that it was performed in March 26, 1653, but this can &s;carcely be credited, unle&s;s we can al&s;o believe that CROMWELL &s;trained a point to plea&s;e the Portugue&s;e amba&s;&s;ador, before whom it is &s;aid to have been repre&s;ented. It is difficult to reconcile this however, e&s;pecially when we reflect that this was the very time the poor actors were &s;o frequently hunted about and &s;ent to pri&s;on. Looking further I find the date in another author 1658, and in LANGBAINE 1659.</P>
<P>The <HI>Politician,</HI> and The <HI>Gentlemen of Venice,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="46">
are tragi comedies and their dates 1658. In mo&s;t of the accounts of them, they are pieces of incon|&s;iderable merit. The fir&s;t is taken from MONT|GOMERY's <HI>Urania,</HI> and the other from <HI>Don Quixote.</HI> The <HI>Contention of Ajax and Uly&s;&s;es for the Armour of Achilles,</HI> is a ma&s;que, or interlude, written to &s;erve &s;ome temporary purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>We have now <HI>Honoria and Mammon</HI> a comedy, date 1649, and <HI>Andromana,</HI> a tragedy, which make up all the works of SHIRLEY that have been printed. He is &s;aid be&s;ides to have written <HI>St. Albans,</HI> a tragedy, <HI>Look to the Lady,</HI> a comedy, and <HI>Ro&s;ania, or Love's Victory,</HI> a comedy, but the&s;e were never publi&s;hed. <HI>Honoria and Mammon</HI> is nothing more than the <HI>Contention for Honour and Riches,</HI> &s;welled from an interlude into a comedy, and <HI>An|dromana, or the Merchant's Wife,</HI> is &s;ir PHILIP SID|NEY's <HI>Arcadia,</HI> taken up again to le&s;s purpo&s;e than when it was handled the fir&s;t time.</P>
<P>Thus we have enumerated at lea&s;t the plays of SHIRLEY. To critici&s;e them would require more room than can here be &s;pared. His works, however, have been at different times, except the three la&s;t mentioned pieces, all publi&s;hed, but are difficult to be got at, though the e&s;&s;ence of them will be found in other authors, which circum&s;tance
<PB N="47" REF="47">
has made SHIRLEY a &s;trong &s;upporter of the theatre, and there can be no doubt that, though all his plays appear to be written before the Re&s;toration, they very materially, through the management of DA|VENANT contributed to its reputation immediately after it; for his talents have been frequently a theme of admiration for the critics, and, had he not lived in a very di&s;couraging time, in&s;tead of &s;eeing his works pilfered and mutilated, we &s;hould have had the &s;a|tisfaction and he the credit of finding his name placed greatly above others who, with &s;hallower preten|tions, have been con&s;idered as better writers.</P>
<P>RANDOLPH was a writer of very extraordinary abilities. He was one of the very few in whom learning became no clog to genius, and this &s;eems to have been becau&s;e in him the natural and acquired qualities were tempered by a mo&s;t equitable mean in his judgement. I cannot comprehend that lan|guage can be more beautiful, more &s;en&s;ible, more keen, more ju&s;t, than in many parts of the <HI>Mu&s;es Looking Gla&s;s.</HI> It does not, however, appear, though RANDOLPH, for the &s;pecimen we have of him, was perhaps the be&s;t poet between SPENCER and DRY|DEN, that the drama was his true &s;tyle of writing. His language was above common nature; it was ever elevated, ever &s;oaring, and therefore its be&s;t
<PB N="48" REF="48">
vehicle was rhime and mea&s;ure. But let us look at his dramatic pieces, which are &s;ix in number.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;tippus,</HI> a comedy, date 1630. This piece &s;eems to have been written faceciou&s;ly to excu&s;e tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es to which RANDOLPH was indeed too fatally attached, for they killed him at the age of twenty-nine. It is called <HI>Ari&s;tippus, or the Jovial Philo&s;opher, demon&s;tratively proving that quarts, pints, and pottles are &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary authors in a &s;cholar's library.</HI> I think it very unlikely that this <HI>Jeux d'e&s;prit,</HI> though it was publi&s;hed, was ever performed. The <HI>Conceited Pedlar,</HI> was a mere bagatelle that accompanied the above play.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jealous Lovers,</HI> which is dated 1632, is &s;aid to be the be&s;t of RANDOLPH's works. The writing is certainly not &s;o ma&s;terly as that of the <HI>Mu&s;es Looking Gla&s;s,</HI> but taking it as a regular co|medy there can be no doubt but the critics are right. He was the darling wit of the univer&s;ity, the &s;tudents delighted in performing this play them|&s;elves, and almo&s;t every man of eminent genius wrote &s;omething in prai&s;e of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e panegyrics are too long to tran&s;cribe. The &s;en&s;e of one of them is, that the <HI>Jealous Lovers</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="49">
ought to be con&s;erved in &s;ome great library; that if, through chance or injury of time, ARISTO|PHANES, PLAUTUS, and TERENCE &s;hould be lo&s;t to the world, their united merit might be recognized in this play; for &s;ays the panegyri&s;t thou ha&s;t drawn the pander, the gall, the jealous lover, the doating father, the &s;hark, the cur&s;t wife. All the&s;e, &s;ays he, thou ha&s;t
<Q><L>So truly given in their own proper &s;tyle</L>
<L>As if thy active &s;oul had dwelt a while</L>
<L>In each man's body; and at length had &s;een</L>
<L>How in their humours they them&s;elves demean.</L></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;es Looking Gla&s;s,</HI> date 1638. A &s;ingle objection lies again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion that this is one of the greate&s;t efforts of human genius, and even this objection is almo&s;t done away in the clo&s;et. The <HI>Mu&s;es Looking Gla&s;s,</HI> which is called a comedy, is certainly nothing more than a collection of de|tached &s;cenes which, though they have a laudable and moral tendency, grow cold from being decla|matory and unimportant for want of a plot, to the denouement of which the characters ought to be impelled by one natural intere&s;t. In &s;hort, this &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of dialogues are conveyed to the audience through a grex, and therefore with the di&s;appearance of each character all concern cea&s;es with the real auditor.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="50">On this account the <HI>Mu&s;es Looking Gla&s;s</HI> can never generally &s;ucceed. Nothing can be finer than the &s;ubtle variety of arguments by which COLAX reconciles di&s;content, fool hardine&s;s, cow|ardly fear, voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, &s;elf denial, avarice, pro|digality, and the prodigious &s;hades of vice and folly which this capable and di&s;criminating author has in|troduced into his play; but if COLAX is tired with them and admini&s;ters to their vanity to get rid of them how much more mu&s;t the audience cool, in &s;pight of their wre&s;ted admiration of tho&s;e charming arguments, which &s;eem to pervade all the pa&s;&s;ions, and their di&s;tinctions, in human nature.</P>
<P>Invention was almo&s;t exhau&s;ted in its prai&s;e, and among the efforts of its numerous admirers we find the following happy di&s;tich by WEST.<Q><L>Who looks within his clearer gla&s;s, will &s;ay</L>
<L>At once he wrote on ethic tract, and play.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Amynlas, or the Impo&s;&s;ible Dowry,</HI> date 1638, has great beauty. It is replete with the be&s;t traits which di&s;tingui&s;hed GUARINI, and TASSO, without the fervile re&s;emblance of either. With &s;implicity, it is full of elevation; and, though correctly natural, it is highly dignified. In &s;hort, it is one of the fine&s;t &s;pecimens of pa&s;toral poetry in this language, and the &s;ubject is appropriate and intere&s;ting; but not
<PB N="51" REF="51">
being filled with a &s;ufficient variety of characters, and incidents, to give it life on the &s;tage, it has never been revived with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>His la&s;t play was called <HI>Hey for Hone&s;ty, Down with Knavery.</HI> This being only an ingenious tran&s;la|tion from the <HI>Plutus</HI> of ARISTOPHANES, it was too extravagant a bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ucceed, had it been at|tempted, but there is rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e it was never performed.</P>
<P>The works of this author, beautiful and correct as they are every where as writings, are by no means &s;ufficiently dramatic; and, therefore, they have furni&s;hed a large &s;ource of materials for tho&s;e who could not write &s;o well but who could manage better. DODSLEY &s;ays with his u&s;ual candour and frankne&s;s, at the &s;ame time that he confe&s;&s;es his ob|ligations to RANDOLPH for his <HI>Toy&s;hop,</HI> the hint of which he took from the <HI>Conceited Pedlar,</HI> that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the <HI>Mu&s;es Looking Gla&s;s</HI> has been always e&s;teemed as an excellent common place book to in&s;truct dra|matic authors in the art of drawing characters."</Q></P>
<P>This holds good in a much &s;tronger degree. No author for the quantity he wrote has been &s;o pil&s;ered as RANDOLPH, and no wonder. Where &s;hould men find materials but at the fountain head?
<PB N="52" REF="52">
'Tis univer&s;ally allowed that there never was a writer more original. When his brother publi&s;hed his works in 1664, which ran through five editions, a friend, on reading them, wrote the following lines:
<Q><L>With what an exta&s;y &s;hall we behold</L>
<L>This book? Which is no gho&s;t of any old</L>
<L>Worm eaten author: here's no je&s;t, or hint,</L>
<L>It had his head both for its ore, and mint.</L>
<L>Were't not for &s;ome tran&s;lations, none could know</L>
<L>Whether he had e'er looked in book or no.</L></Q></P>
<P>In RANDOLPH the world certainly lo&s;t an in|valuable trea&s;ure; for, if in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e fa&s;hionable exce&s;&s;es into which he &s;o thoughtle&s;sly plunged, and which cut him off &s;o early in life, he was able to produce &s;o many &s;terling and admirable proofs of great and extraordinary genius, particular learning, and general information; what might not have been expected from him had he lived to have matured &s;uch talents, to have felt the hone&s;t pride derived from meritorious exertions, and a con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;uperior dignity re&s;ulting from the power and the gratification of conveying delight and in&s;truction to mankind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. MAY, BROME, MILTON, AND COWLEY.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I examine the productions of DRYDEN and other dramatic authors, who&s;e labours &s;tretch beyond the Revolution, I &s;hall go through all tho&s;e who fini&s;hed their career before that event; taking them by &s;eniority either as to fame or the time in which they wrote.</P>
<P>MAY, who was, as we have &s;een, competitor with &s;ir WILLIAM DAVENANT for the laurel, was a man of no mean abilities. General poetry, however, and hi&s;tory, were more congenial to his talents than the &s;tage. He &s;eems to have manife&s;ted all the vexation of a di&s;appointed man from the moment he failed in his contention with &s;ir WILLIAM DA|VENANT; for, after having been an accompli&s;hed and plyant courtier, out of mere picque and re&s;ent|ment, he e&s;pou&s;ed the republican cau&s;e without motive, or without principle; acting a part exactly
<PB N="54" REF="54">
oppo&s;ite to the conduct of DAVENANT, who&s;e loyalty, and duty, have been the theme of every man's admiration.</P>
<P>Lord CLARENDON after commending his good qualities as a man, and extolling his merit as a poet and a hi&s;torian, is forced into the following con|fe&s;&s;ion:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yet, to &s;hew that pride and envy have their influence upon the narrowe&s;t minds, and which have the greate&s;t &s;emblance of humility, though he had received much countenance, and a very con&s;iderable donative from the king, upon his maje&s;ty's refu&s;ing to give him a &s;mall pen&s;ion, which he had de&s;igned and promi&s;ed to another very ingenious per&s;on, who&s;e qualities he thought inferior to his own, he fell from his duty and all his former friends, and pro&s;tituted him&s;elf to the vile office of celebrating the infamous acts of tho&s;e who were in rebellion again&s;t the king; which he did &s;o meanly, that he &s;eemed to all men to have lo&s;t his wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> when he left his hone&s;ty; and &s;hortly after died mi&s;erable and neglected, and de&s;erves to be forgotten."</Q></P>
<P>His tran&s;lation of LUCAN's <HI>Phar&s;alia,</HI> and his own &s;upplement of LUCAN, are allowed to be good poetry, and his hi&s;tory of RICHARD the &s;econd, is
<PB N="55" REF="55">
de&s;ervedly celebrated. His plays, five in number, had con&s;iderable merit.</P>
<P><HI>Antigone,</HI> a tragedy, date 1631. This play is borrowed from SOPHOCLES, SENECA, and STATIUS; and, though it has merit in the writing, is dull and heavy and too unwieldy to accommodate it&s;elf to action, and therefore plea&s;es readers tolerably well, but hearers not at all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Heir,</HI> a comedy, dated 1633, has a great &s;hare of merit. It was publi&s;hed by DODSLEY in his collection of old plays, and is certainly full of intere&s;ting &s;ituation and &s;trong characteri&s;tic writing; but it is by no means a perfect play, nor can it be made &s;o. The enmity of the two hou&s;es, the &s;trange demand of the king that LEUCOTHOE &s;hall yield to his de&s;ires, and the con&s;table, and the watch, who &s;eize EUGENIO, are all &s;tolen from SHAKESPEAR; but the&s;e plagiaries are coar&s;e caricatures, and what's wor&s;e are introduced without a fair drift or motive.</P>
<P>The under plot is gro&s;s and indelicate; and, though there is &s;ome whim in making SHALLOW, out of vanity and boa&s;ting, take the di&s;grace to him|&s;elf of LUCY's being with child by him, though he knows he never had any criminal intercour&s;e with her; her being delivered of a pillow is &s;ailing rather
<PB N="56" REF="56">
too near the wind. Upon the whole there is &s;ome|thing to admire in this play but chalk drawings from <HI>Romeo and Juliet, Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure,</HI> and <HI>Much ado about Nothing,</HI> and tho&s;e &s;aint and without force, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be con&s;idered as an admi&s;&s;ible &s;ub|&s;titute for tho&s;e admirable pictures of nature and truth, which are &s;o greatly &s;uperior in the pro|ductions of our incomparable bard.</P>
<P><HI>Agrippina,</HI> a tragedy, date 1628, is taken from XIPHILINUS, TACITUS, and SUETONIUS. The &s;ubject is unproductive and never has &s;ucceeded on any &s;tage, notwith&s;tanding the various ways it has been attempted to be brought forward. MAY's effort is but weak, and therefore, though it was printed at three different periods, it has been but little known on the &s;tage.</P>
<P><HI>Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt,</HI> date 1654. In this tragedy MAY either to manife&s;t his candour, or his reading, has given the names of &s;ix cla&s;&s;ical writers, from who&s;e works he took this piece, be&s;ides having followed DANIEL, and con&s;ulted two or three others; yet with all the&s;e good materials, &s;o true it is that too many cooks &s;poil the broth, he has not been able to produce a pa&s;&s;able play.</P>
<P>The <HI>Old Couple,</HI> a comedy, date 1658, which
<PB N="57" REF="57">
accompanies the <HI>Heir</HI> in DODSLEY's collection, is written to expo&s;e the vice of covetou&s;ne&s;s. It abounds with &s;ingular and ludicrous circum&s;tances, and contains &s;ome plea&s;antry and humour. There is &s;omething well conceived in the circum&s;tance of turning the heart of EARTHWORM from avariciou&s;|ne&s;s to benevolence; but the mode is too &s;udden for it cannot be in nature that rooted covetou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould find an in&s;tantaneous cure. As to the tricks that are introduced, fir&s;t to perplex and afterwards to unravel the plot, they are trite and hackneyed and excite more curio&s;ity than they gratify. If upon the whole, however, it were &s;implified it does not want requi|&s;ites to form a good comedy; but a bungler could not effect it, and a man of talents would not think it worth his while to make the trial.</P>
<P>PHILIPS and WINSTANTLY a&s;cribe to MAY two other plays; but it is not proved that one of them was ever &s;een, and it is proved beyond contra|diction that the other was printed before MAY was born. This poet was a proof that FALSTAFF's ob|&s;ervation,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"fretting and grief puffs a man up like a bladder."</Q>
may be truth for he lived a life of vexation and di&s;appointment, and was perpetually a prey to the in&s;tability natural to it, yet he enjoyed
<PB N="58" REF="58">
unconquerable health, and grew &s;o immen&s;ely fat that he was choaked with his night cap.</P>
<P>BROME, who was originally a menial &s;ervant of JONSON, had good &s;en&s;e enough to avail him&s;elf of as much as would &s;erve his purpo&s;e of tho&s;e dog|matic le&s;&s;ons, which, in his o&s;tentation of wit his pre|ceptor forced upon all tho&s;e who would li&s;ten to them. JONSON u&s;ed to brag that of all his pupils BROME had the mo&s;t accommodating docility. His words are &s;aid to have been that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"BROME made a very good u&s;e of the improvement he had ac|quired during a long apprentice&s;hip under &s;o &s;kilful a ma&s;ter."</Q></P>
<P>The be&s;t advantage BROME took of JONSON's le&s;&s;ons was to &s;tudy men and manners; for, as he had &s;trength of mind enough to invent his own plots, and good &s;en&s;e enough to keep to comedy, which he felt to be his proper forte, he found that ob&s;ervation would an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, perhaps, better than reading. There &s;eems al&s;o to have been another piece of cunning about him for which he ought to be commended. It was that, however he might feel him&s;elf equal to the ta&s;k of writing plays, and therefore probably find it nece&s;&s;ary to trea&s;ure up materials for the undertaking, knowing and perhaps
<PB N="59" REF="59">
fearing the ira&s;cible temper of JONSON, he took care not to &s;et him&s;elf up as his rival to any formi|dable degree, for he produced but one play during the life time of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>This was the <HI>Northern La&s;s,</HI> 1632. It was com|mended by ver&s;es from JONSON and others, and is well &s;poken of. Indeed it is &s;aid to be one of the be&s;t of this author's plays, no one of which, to &s;ay truth, ever arrived to any very eminent degree of reputation. They all contain true character, &s;ound language, and natural &s;ituation, and they create in|tere&s;t, but none of the&s;e requi&s;ites are given with &s;ufficient force to effect the mind materially. This comedy was twice revived, the la&s;t time with the addition of &s;ongs compo&s;ed by DANIEL PURCELL, and this &s;eems to be what is wanting to give BROME con&s;equence as a dramatic writer. For there is ju&s;t enough plot and good dialogue in his comedies as might fill up the intervals between the &s;ongs of what we call a comic opera.</P>
<P>His next comedy is dated 1640. It is called The <HI>Sparagus Garden,</HI> and is of the complexion of the la&s;t; but it is even lighter; and. as it has never been revived with &s;ongs, it has been lo&s;t to the theatre for ought we can learn ever &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on of its

repre&s;entation. <HI>Antipodes,</HI> &s;ame year, &s;hared the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jovial Crew</HI> is dated 1652. This piece gives us a complete clue to judge of the merits of this author. It has been frequently revived, and it is in the recollection of many of the public, that em|belli&s;hed with &s;ome &s;weet mu&s;ic by ARNE, and per|formed with great &s;trength it had a con&s;iderable run at Covent Garden theatre, at which time the town received it as a production full of humour, whim, and plea&s;antry; but it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, had it not been for that mu&s;ic, and that &s;trength, its pretentions are not very far above mediocrity, and after all, as we &s;aw it then, it did not come from the hands of of BROME, but had been completely altered into a ballad opera by one ROOME, who was an undertaker for funerals as well as for ballad operas, and who, &s;omehow or other, offended POPE and was therefore introduced into the <HI>Dunciad.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;tate ROOME left the <HI>Jovial Crew,</HI> it was found by &s;ome theatrical amateurs, who improved it &s;till further, and it was not till it had received all this improvement that it came out at Covent Garden, at which time it was patronized by the celebrated and truly amiable &s;ir WILLIAM YOUNG, who&s;e

<P>The <HI>Comus,</HI> and <HI>Sam&s;on Agoni&s;tes,</HI> of MILTON, give me a title to introduce that great man into this work, which I &s;hould do to much &s;tronger effect could my faint prai&s;e add the &s;malle&s;t lu&s;tre to his &s;plendid reputation; or, that accompli&s;hed, were not the happie&s;t effu&s;ions the mind can conceive, or the pen tran&s;mit already anticipated by the delight of his numerous admirers.</P>
<P>It will be impo&s;&s;ible here, even were my incli|nation ever &s;o &s;trong to enquire into the variety of opinions that have been entertained by different writers of MILTON's public and private conduct, his &s;entiments or their incentives, his actions or their motives. Whether his political di&s;qui&s;itions are to be a&s;cribed to principle or intere&s;t, his re|ligious doctrines to piety or hypocricy, whether he lived in penury or pro&s;perity, whether he

looked the milder excellence of &s;uavity and &s;oft|ne&s;s and was a lion that had not &s;kill in dandling the kid,"</Q>
or whether,

Whether, in &s;hort, according to one great man,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he bore his misfortunes with patience and re&s;ignation, and that, after he was blind, his three daughters u&s;ed to read to him;"</Q>
or, according to another,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he was impatient of &s;uffering, and that his daughters could not read at all."</Q></P>
<P>We have only to go over the different accounts of MILTON's life and character, and there is no|thing contradictory but we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to adknow|ledge. He was a catholic, he was a prote&s;tant, he was neither. He rejected prayer, and therefore did not admit religion, and yet in his <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> he makes our fir&s;t parents pray for a continuation of happine&s;s in a &s;tate of innocence, and for a re|&s;toration of it after the fall.</P>
<P>As to his political opinions he is on all hands allowed to have been to blame, but in this he is as much excu&s;ed as reprobated. If by one author we are told
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he was an acrimonious and &s;urly re|publican, for that he hated all tho&s;e whom he was required to obey; that his predominant de&s;ire was to de&s;troy rather than e&s;tabli&s;h, and that he felt

not &s;o much the love of liberty as repugnance to authority,"</Q>
all which would &s;eem to prove that he was mad as well as blind. We are informed by another,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that his moral and religious character were excellent but certainly pu&s;hed too far; for there were &s;ea&s;ons enough in his life when his zeal carried both to a fanatical height, and when he might be &s;aid to have been mad with virtue and religion,"</Q>
which if we allow it is not madne&s;s of the &s;ame colour with the other author's a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Leaving tho&s;e matters and rejecting all enquiry whether MILTON was tall and well made, &s;hort and thick, whether his favourite weapon in the field was the rapier or the back &s;word, or his con&s;tant in&s;tru|ment in the clo&s;et was the organ or the theorbo, whether his mu&s;e was coy at one &s;ea&s;on and com|plying at another, whether, when he wrote, he took pen and ink like Mr. JOHNSON, or &s;tewed prunes like Mr. BAYES; whether he was a ba&s;haw in his hou&s;e and looked upon women with contempt; or whether he in&s;tructed and delighted them by the charms of his conver&s;ation; let us examine his li|terary merit and opinions.</P>
<P>Going into the&s;e as far as my circum&s;cribed plan will allow I &s;hall not be very &s;olicitous to induce the reader's belief that MILTON, though he might
<PB N="65" REF="65">
very naturally &s;et a high value on SPENCER and SHAKESPEAR could either con&s;ider COWLEY a great writer, who&s;e genius was totally di&s;&s;imilar to his own, or DRYDEN, who&s;e &s;oul was formed of materials extremely like that of MILTON, no writer at all.</P>
<P>Certainly MILTON had a high value for foreign authors as well ancient as modern, and he was qualified more to ta&s;te their beauties than perhaps any Engli&s;hman of great genius that then exi&s;ted; for he knew correctly mo&s;t of the living and dead lan|guages; but this would confirm in him a more com|petent power to decide on the merits of his coun|trymen unle&s;s we can believe what has been in|&s;inuated that he extolled COWLEY becau&s;e he was dead and there was no danger in him, and decried DRYDEN becau&s;e he was living and capable of proving a rival. Let us believe that his mind was too firm, and his &s;entiments too &s;ublime to admit of &s;uch unprincipled inju&s;tice, or &s;uch pitiful fluctuation.</P>
<P>As every thing lyric is in its nature dramatic, dithyrambics having been the origin of the drama, and lyric poetry being, as MILTON expre&s;&s;es it, wedded to mu&s;ic, it will not be going out of my way
<PB N="66" REF="66">
to &s;peak of <HI>Lycidas, Il Pen&s;ero&s;o,</HI> and <HI>L'Allegro.</HI> To &s;ay truth, the metre of MILTON is every where mu|&s;ical, which is not wonderful, for his father was a mu|&s;ician, from whom he knew mu&s;ic him&s;elf, and at a proper time we &s;hall &s;ee how u&s;eful he was to LAWES in the original compo&s;ition of <HI>Comus,</HI> and it will not be an offence, I humbly pre&s;ume, to a&s;&s;ert, though poets have written well who, according to the vulgar phra&s;e, have not been able to turn a tune, that &s;hould, by accident, a mu&s;ical mind be grafted on a poetical one the combined effect, emanating from the &s;ame ideas, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be more forcible than were it to re&s;ult from the colli&s;ion of two dif|ferent minds however congenial; for it is infallible, that the mu&s;ician mu&s;t lo&s;e &s;ome of the furor of the poet, and the poet of the mu&s;ician<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I knew a mu&s;ician of &s;ome eminence who, being engaged to compo&s;e mu&s;ic, like doers of periodical works, at &s;o much per &s;heet, the words to be provided or written by his employer, and knowing the impo&s;&s;ibility of finding corre&s;pondent expre&s;&s;ions for the lines he had to &s;et, for he might as well have compo&s;ed a game at crambo, would con&s;tantly get the metre into his mind and invent a gavotte, or a jig, to &s;uit it, and this mu&s;t be done by a mu&s;ician of real genius; but all the mu&s;ical genuis upon earth could not do this by words in their nature truly lyric; by the poetry for in&s;tance of MILTON or DRYDEN. The a&s;&s;i&s;tance here mu&s;t be mutual, for the expre&s;&s;ion of the poetry points out the nature of the mu&s;ic requi&s;ite for its appropriate de|coration, and the mu&s;ic gathers a &s;trength and a beauty from the charms of the poetey that in&s;pired it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="67"><HI>Lycidas,</HI> though a weak and, in &s;ome re&s;pects, an incongruous poem, &s;uch as probably cannot &s;u&s;tain a trial by the &s;evere laws of critici&s;m, has never|thele&s;s many beauties; but I would not have the world &s;o deceived as to imagine that the blemi&s;hes of this poem are its imagery, for what would be its merit, being lyric, if it had not imagery? I will not allow any writer to critici&s;e lyric poetry who has not as SHAKESPEAR phra&s;es it, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"mu&s;ic in his &s;oul,"</Q> and this ob&s;ervation cannot be con&s;idered as illiberal &s;ince I accompany it with a declaration that a man need not be indi&s;pen&s;ibly a mu&s;ician to po&s;&s;e&s;s this divine quality.</P>
<P>Critics, ver&s;ed even to au&s;terity in all the nice and di&s;criminating rules by which the nature of poetry are &s;quared and mea&s;ured, have my free con&s;ent to examine an epic poem, a heroic poem, a didactic poem; but when good &s;en&s;e, that forbids in one in&s;tance, permits in another, when fancy is un|bound and the mind wearied with in&s;truction &s;eeks for plea&s;ure, it would be mortification in&s;tead of en|joyment not to encourage any latitude within the pale of con&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>We are told that in <HI>Lycidas</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"there are no ef|fu&s;ions of real pa&s;&s;ion, for that pa&s;&s;ion runs not
<PB N="68" REF="68">

to which is added,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that where there is lei&s;ure for fiction there is little for grief."</Q>
What a blow is here aimed at the beauty of oriental poetry that has &s;o long been the delight of the world.</P>
<P>Let us meet this critic half way; let us fairly admit that MILTON and his friend who was drowned were not &s;hepherds; but does this prove that they did not admire the beauties of nature together? And if they did is it not very natural that the lo&s;s of tho&s;e beauties &s;hould be deplored.</P>
<P>But it &s;o happens that this allegory is only &s;ub|&s;ervient to truth. Solitude is the abode of melan|choly. In &s;olitude, the &s;hepherd or the poet if you will invokes his mu&s;e, which according to the&s;e &s;trict injunctions ought to be forbidden too, for no mu&s;e literally comes to a poet's aid, or even hears him. He invokes her with &s;incerity, for he &s;ays
<Q><L>So may &s;ome gentle mu&s;e</L>
<L>With lucky words favour my de&s;tined urn,</L>
<L>And as he pa&s;&s;es turn,</L>
<L>And bid fair peace be to my fable &s;hroud:</L></Q>
Now this is not only &s;incere but it is affecting, and has a great deal of the heart in it; but perhaps &s;ome cynic may in&s;i&s;t, to &s;hew what critici&s;m is, that it is
<PB N="69" REF="69">
void of feeling and full of &s;elf intere&s;t, for he only rai&s;es an urn to his friend that &s;omebody may rai&s;e one to him.</P>
<P>If we permit this innovation, for if we did not we mu&s;t cut up poetry, and particularly lyric poetry, by the roots, let us al&s;o give him leave, e&s;pecially as it is a &s;weet and affecting &s;entiment, to &s;ay
<Q><L>For we were nur&s;ed upon the &s;elf &s;ame hill,</L>
<L>Fed the &s;ame flock by fountain &s;hade and rill,</L>
<L>Together both, ere the high lawns appeared</L>
<L>Under the opening eyelids of the morn,</L>
<L>We drove a-field, and both together heard</L>
<L>What time the grey-fly winds her &s;ultry horn,</L>
<L>Battening our flocks with the fre&s;h dews of night,</L>
<L>Oft, till the &s;tar, that ro&s;e at evening bright,</L>
<L>Towards heaven's de&s;cent had &s;toped his we&s;tern wheel.</L></Q>
Here is a beautiful truth expre&s;&s;ed by a figure, which figure adds innocence to friend&s;hip, and contempla|tion to &s;entiment. We know MILTON and his friend, as our critic &s;ays, never drove a-field, by the way the critic has left out the hyphen, and that they had no flocks to batten, but if they ob&s;erved the&s;e beautiful objects from a window, or even if they made them the theme of their admiration in a chim|ney corner, the implied truth remains invincible, and the heart irre&s;i&s;tably admits and partakes the real grief occa&s;ioned by the &s;eparation of two friends who&s;e
<PB N="70" REF="70">
minds were &s;o well &s;uited to receive and impart re|ciprocal delight and in&s;truction.</P>
<P>So much for the critical defects of <HI>Lycidas.</HI> Its poetical errors are the errors of inexperience; but its beauties are in number and of magnitude enough infinitely to overcome both.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid &s;o much on the &s;ubject of <HI>Lycidas,</HI> be|cau&s;e one has naturally a greater plea&s;ure to ju&s;tify than to blame. In the <HI>Allegro</HI> and the <HI>Penfero&s;o</HI> as there is nothing to blame &s;o there is nothing to ju&s;tify. The di&s;tinctions are uniformly appropriate, and the &s;entiments uniformly beautiful. The plea|&s;ure is gay, chearful, and winning, but neither thoughtle&s;s, trifling, or licentious. The melancholy is neither &s;our, &s;arca&s;tic, or moro&s;e, but complacent, &s;oothing, and moral.</P>
<P>HANDEL, who is every where unequal, except in <HI>Acis and Galatea,</HI> has &s;et &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the&s;e poems wonderfully, and others mo&s;t unworthily in|deed. Perhaps, which appears to have been his fault every where, he has attempted at the effect without feeling the &s;entiment; but this will be placed in a better light hereafter. In the mean time, while &s;ome critics find melancholy in MILTON's mirth, and
<PB N="71" REF="71">
others mirth in his melancholy, for that the <HI>Allegro</HI> begins with a deprecation of &s;adne&s;s rather than an inovation to chearfulne&s;s, and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> let us re&s;t &s;atisfied with ta&s;ting the beauties of two of the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t winning poems that ever graced Engli&s;h literature.</P>
<P><HI>Sam&s;on Agoni&s;tes,</HI> which was altered into an oratorio by doctor MORELLE, into which HANDEL introduced &s;ome very good mu&s;ic, nay, the doubt is among his admirers, who knew be&s;t how to judge of its merits, whether this or <HI>Judas Maccabeus</HI> be his be&s;t oratorio, was not intended by MILTON for repre&s;entation, nor indeed is it capable of it.</P>
<P>It is however the be&s;t calculated &s;ubject for an oratorio of any that has ever been treated; for, without any violence or impropriety it naturally mixes the holy and the profane, and VOLTAIRE has &s;o well taken this advantage of it that he has not only well adapted it to the &s;tage, but has ren|dered it a good vehicle for mu&s;ic, which MILTON never dreamt of; for, as he knew from the &s;ubject it could not with propriety be repre&s;ented, he has written the whole in blank ver&s;e, making the an|cients his model, and appearing fearful, le&s;t this cla&s;&s;ical &s;pecies of tragedy &s;hould be confounded with common interludes.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="72">To &s;ay truth <HI>Sam&s;on</HI> is not a tragedy but a morality, formed upon the principles of AESCHYLUS, SOPHOCLES, and EURIPIDES; to which &s;pecies of tragedy MILTON is very &s;olicitous that his readers &s;hould give the preference, though in his chorus, becau&s;e he could not imitate them &s;eparately, for they &s;eparately di&s;agreed, he has literally taken, as nearly as the opportunity would permit, the manner of all.</P>
<P>Though &s;omething primitive runs through every part of MILTON, yet it is wonderful that he, who knew the latitude and the liberality of the living as well as the dead languages, &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly prefer the ancient tragedy with
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"its incumbrance of a chorus,"</Q>
as JOHNSON truly &s;ays, to the modern. The be&s;t authors find numberle&s;s difficulties in the way of making a tragedy natural; and, as every thing that appeals to the &s;en&s;e mu&s;t be more perfect as it approaches to nature, &s;o tragedy being nature repre&s;ented, every extraneous and auxilliary intro|duction that does not &s;trengthen the action, advance the intere&s;t, or facilitate the plot, is an impediment in&s;tead of an a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and therefore MILTON's po|&s;ition in this mu&s;t be radically wrong; but his learn|ing was au&s;tere, and his prejudices were bigotry, and thus his objects were rather grandeur than greatne&s;s, his language rather beauty than pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="73">On the merits of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> I &s;hall be very &s;hort. It is out of my province; and, if it were not, all ob&s;ervation is now needle&s;s. No book ever found the level of its own intrin&s;ic fame &s;o correctly as this; and, though we have been taught to deplore that it &s;old for a pityful &s;um, and that in &s;pight of the exertions of DRYDEN, who&s;e conduct upon this occa&s;ion mu&s;t have been very amiable if MILTON thought him no poet, the arts of book|&s;ellers, and many other popular inducements, years elap&s;ed before any impre&s;&s;ion of con&s;equnce was vended; yet nothing tells its own &s;tory &s;o plain as the hi&s;tory of this work.</P>
<P><HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> was written in a &s;tyle above com|mon comprehen&s;ion, and the learned alone knew its value. The&s;e are not always able, nor indeed willing to patronize literature; and therefore a book, which mu&s;t be publicly taught before it can be publicly under&s;tood, mu&s;t naturally make a very &s;low pro|gre&s;s even towards notoriety; but, this attained, it requires &s;till more to give it celebrity, which it cannot arrive at till it be both univer&s;ally read and felt; and, as it happens that <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> cannot po&s;&s;ibly be ta&s;ted by a twentieth part, perhaps a much larger proportion, of tho&s;e who have either willingly or compul&s;ively gone through it, its tardy
<PB N="74" REF="74">
approach to general encouragement is very ea&s;ily accounted for; and thus will this great, this won|derful, this divine poem, though now in all li|braries, and indeed in all pockets, except the application of a few quotations, remain alone for ever, a delicious fea&s;t for men of &s;trong genius and profound erudition.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have not dared to hint their doubts as to the merit of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> for fear of betraying their ignorance, have, however, pretty well mani|fe&s;ted it by their indi&s;criminate reprobation of <HI>Para|di&s;e Regained;</HI> which would have no place in any library could it with decency be expunged from the works of MILTON. It is not &s;o powerful a poem by a great difference as the other, it has, however, many beauties; but, as the&s;e were not &s;o plainly within the comprehen&s;ion of general readers as the faults, they have cho&s;en to declare that it contains no beauties at all; and thus while they fancy they do ju&s;tice on MILTON by decrying his work, they blindly do ju&s;tice on them&s;elves by expo&s;ing their own folly to the world's deri&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have now only to &s;peak of <HI>Comus;</HI> a pro|duction which, as a drama, has been generally con|demned, but highly commended as a piece of writing. I cannot &s;ee how a ma&s;que may be cri|tici&s;ed
<PB N="75" REF="75">
by critical dramatic rules, being a &s;pecies of entertainment in which the author is permitted to re&s;ort to &s;upernatural agency and bring forward whatever may recreate and delight the fancy. A forcerer ever upon the watch to en&s;nare the inno|cent, a blamele&s;s woman betrayed into his power, and a protecting &s;pirit who watches over her and averts her danger, are characters that &s;erve to create an intere&s;t and &s;ecure it, and therefore nothing can be more perfectly dramatic taken in a general &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been objected to the &s;tory that it is not probable. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As far as the action is merely human,"</Q> &s;ays doctor JOHNSON,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it ought to be rea&s;onable, which can hardly be &s;aid of the conduct of the brothers; who, when their &s;i&s;ter &s;inks with fatigue in a pathle&s;s wilderne&s;s, wander both away to|gether in &s;earch of berries too far to find their way back, and leave a helple&s;s lady to all the &s;ad|ne&s;s and danger of &s;olitude."</Q></P>
<P>Now it &s;o happens that, impo&s;&s;ible as all this may appear, it is a fact; for it happened to lord BRACLY and Mr. EGERTON, &s;ons of the earl of BRIDGEWATER, and their &s;i&s;ter.

on their arrival, after many difficulties, at Ludlow Ca&s;tle, which was their re&s;idence, MILTON was re|que&s;ted to form the &s;tory into a ma&s;que. LAWES was employed to compo&s;e the mu&s;ic, who per|formed him&s;elf the attendant &s;pirit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>What we ought exactly to credit upon this head it is difficult to &s;ay. LAWES is in general &s;uppo&s;ed to have compo&s;ed the mu&s;ic of Comus. It is &s;aid that in this ta&s;k MILTON very ma|terially a&s;&s;i&s;ted him; which he certainly might have done as he learnt mu&s;ic of his father; but we are al&s;o told that IVES as well as LAWES was concerned in it, and that they had each a hun|dred pounds for their trouble; by the way if this was the truth they paid a better price for mu&s;ic at that time than they do now, but we are given further to under&s;tand that four gentlemen of the king's band were al&s;o invited to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the repre&s;entation; and, being &s;et down previou&s;ly to a collation where each had a covered plate lain for him, upon withdrawing the covers every man found forty pieces of gold <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of their ma&s;ter's coin,"</Q> &s;ays the hi&s;torian, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for the fir&s;t di&s;h!"</Q> All this, however, &s;eems to wear an air more of plau&s;ibility than truth; for there were but five &s;ongs originally in Comus, two of which, Sweet Echo, and Sabrina Fair, are un|doubtedly the compo&s;ition of LAWES. I think it more rational, either to put IVES out of the que&s;tion, or to &s;uppo&s;e that he was one of the gentlemen of the chapel, and that he a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the performance; for LAWES had certainly a great influence in the earl of BRIDGE|WATER's family. He taught lady ALICE EGERTON, and there is no doubt but that, having &s;o fair an opportunity, he prevailed on MILTON to write the ma&s;que to favour his intere&s;t, for he was per|mitted to dedicate it to the young lord in his own name, and in the dedication he intimates that the author &s;tands aloof, for he &s;ays that it is a legitimate offspring, although not openly acknowledged by its author. On this account I think it is very unlikely that he had any a&s;&s;ociate at all; for he was &s;uffered, as mo&s;t mu&s;icians ridiculou&s;ly are, to alter the author. In&s;tead of the words

<P>This may convince us that MILTON had not only a great deal of forbearance but was very accommodating; for it is not likely that he who made the pun could have written the dedication, and in this ca&s;e LAWES &s;eems to have been to MILTON what LULLY was to QUINAULT.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>In &s;hort, con&s;ider it as an entertainment written for a private family, than which nothing at that time could be more common, it is fully an&s;werable to every purpo&s;e; for the &s;tage, it would have been too tame and de&s;titute of variety; but, at any rate, it contains the fir&s;t principle of all that wonderful &s;ubtility of rea&s;on and reflection, &s;o variou&s;ly turned and tran&s;muted in <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall, therefore, leave <HI>Comus</HI> till we come to it in the &s;tate it was prepared by DALTON for the &s;tage, principally out of MILTON, and embelli&s;hed with the delicious mu&s;ic of ARNE, and only &s;ay, by way of an humble tribute of e&s;teem to the memory of its author, that, while one celebrated writer &s;ays he cannot be brought to wi&s;h that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"MILTON had been a rhymer,"</Q>
which, heaven knows he was, and an

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he was great rather than u&s;eful,"</Q>
in his particular career the world has &s;een nothing like his poetry that has &s;o proudly emulated the ancients, that the longer lan|guage endures the more he will be admired, that his talents were &s;o commanding he wrote for po&s;terity more than for the time he lived in, and that future ages, as they entwine the wreath of erudition, &s;hall decorate it with the names of HOMER and MILTON.</P>
<P>COWLEY, a mo&s;t &s;ingular and extraordinary writer, who produced a great deal to amu&s;e the fancy and but little to fix the mind, claims a place here on account of his having written a pa&s;toral called <HI>Love's Riddle,</HI> and a comedy under the title of The <HI>Guardian,</HI> and afterwards revived and called The <HI>Cutter of Coleman Street.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not imitate an eminent biographer, who laments that he cannot a&s;certain whether COWLEY's father was a &s;ectary or not, but adds very &s;agaciou&s;ly that whatever he was, as he died before his &s;on was born that &s;on was nece&s;&s;arily brought up by his mother; on the contrary I &s;hall take a review, a &s;hort one itmu&s;t be, of his works, and more particularly tho&s;e that fall regularly under my notice.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="80">I look upon COWLEY to have been the rever&s;e of SHAKESPEAR, for he de&s;troyed a fervid and &s;plendid genius by running it into every thing quaint and fanta&s;tic, in&s;tead of permitting it to indulge it&s;elf in &s;implicity and &s;ublimity. Thus his ideas are mature in childhood, and childi&s;h in old age, for forty nine might be called &s;o in COWLEY who ex|hau&s;ted his mind as &s;ome do their con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>His fancy was perpetually upon the &s;tretch, and he for ever &s;hunned what &s;hould intere&s;t the heart for that which could only a&s;toni&s;h the imagination; and yet, with tin&s;el, quaintne&s;s, and mo&s;t tormenting expletives, we find him now and then a wonderful poet. He has been very properly &s;tyled the greate&s;t of the metaphy&s;ical writers, and the grand &s;ervice this has done mankind is, that, being the greate&s;t he was nece&s;&s;arily the la&s;t; for the ri&s;k of &s;oaring after him began to cool the fervour of his imitators, and they wondered to find that a pur&s;uit after truth and nature, which was to be accompli&s;hed without any hazard, could captivate tho&s;e minds with delight which it had hitherto been their &s;tudy to &s;trike with a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Strained hyperboles, and unnatural fictions, per|vade the works of COWLEY. They are full of
<PB N="81" REF="81">
images, tin&s;el, conceits, and tropes. Whether he addre&s;s a mi&s;tre&s;s, a god, or a pa&s;&s;ion, the object is likened to every thing in and out of nature. His mu&s;e profe&s;&s;es all manner of trades and callings, and his mind is a complete mu&s;eum of qualities, and yet when you do admire him he is greatly beautiful. See how he &s;oars above PINDAR, and the next minute &s;inks and grovels in the bathos.<Q><LG>
<L>Begin the &s;ong and &s;trike the living lyre:</L>
<L>Lo how the years to come, a numerous and well fitted quire,</L>
<L>All hand in hand do decently advance,</L>
<L>And to my &s;ong with &s;mooth and equal mea&s;ure dance</L>
<L>While the dance la&s;ts, how long &s;oe'er it be,</L>
<L>My mu&s;ick's voice &s;hall bear it company,</L>
<L>Until all gentle notes be drowned</L>
<L>In the la&s;t trumpet's dreadful &s;ound.</L>
</LG>

<L>But &s;top my mu&s;e&mdash;</L>

<L>But flings writer, and reader too, that &s;its not &s;ure</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Is not this a madman fir&s;t in a lucid interval, and afterwards in a paroxy&s;m of frenzy. ADDISON, &s;peaking of his poem called the <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ob|&s;erving the cold regard of his mi&s;tre&s;s's eyes, and at the &s;ame time their power of producing love in him, he con&s;iders them as burning gla&s;&s;es made
<PB N="82" REF="82">
made of ice. Finding him&s;elf able to live in the greate&s;t extremities of love, he concludes the torrid zone to the habitable.</Q></P>
<P>See how COWLEY makes mu&s;icians of the ele|ments, and fairly qualifies them to &s;ing a glee in four parts. Speaking of order as it ro&s;e out of Chaos he &s;ays,
<Q><L>The ungoverned parts no corre&s;pondence knew;</L>
<L>An artle&s;s war from thwarting motions grew,</L>
<L>'Till they to number and fixed rules were brought;</L>
<L>Water, and air, he for the tenor cho&s;e,</L>
<L>Earth made the ba&s;s, the treble flame aro&s;e.</L></Q>
For hyberbole, MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS is a fool to COWLEY.</P>
<Q><L>By every wind that comes this way,</L>
<L>Send me at lea&s;t a &s;igh or two;</L>
<L>Such and &s;o many I'll repay</L>
<L>As &s;hall them&s;elves make winds to get to you.</L></Q>
<P>But to have done with this &s;en&s;ible madman. Whatever excellence there may be found in the different parts of COWLEY, to whatever heights he may have arrived in his flights of fancy, whatever real gems may be hid among his foil &s;tones and his tin&s;el, all our re&s;earches are curio&s;ity without grati|fication, and toil without profit. His works are like a meteor burnt out, that a&s;toni&s;hed beholders with its glare while it la&s;ted; but, its influence once over, it
<PB N="83" REF="83">
has ever &s;ince remained the ruin of what it was, a dull opaque body, incapable of emitting fire, or re|flecting light.</P>
<P><HI>Love's Riddle,</HI> written when COWLEY was but fifteen, is a pa&s;toral and has had the advantage, if it may be called &s;o, of much indi&s;criminate prai&s;e, throughall which we &s;ee, however, that it was a very puerile performance. Doctor JOHNSON &s;ays it is of the pa&s;toral kind <Q REND="inline">"which,"</Q> &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"requires no ac|quaintance with the living world, and therefore, being compo&s;ed while the author was yet at &s;chool, it adds little to the wonders of his minority."</Q>
It mu&s;t be noticed that COWLEY, like POPE, li&s;ped in numbers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Guardian,</HI> which COWLEY &s;ays was neither written nor acted but rough drawn by him and re|peated by the &s;cholars, was fitted to the &s;tage after a time under the name of The <HI>Cutter of Coleman Street;</HI> but it is &s;urely a very poor play, and, if by this time its author had acquired an acquaintace with the living world, he has treated men and man|ners &s;o clum&s;ily that he might as well have kept to his fawns and his &s;atyrs. It was very ill received, but his friends had adroitne&s;s enough to palliate his di&s;|grace by a&s;&s;erting that the fall of the piece was owing to a mi&s;taken notion that it was a party bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="84">So much for COWLEY, one of the mo&s;t extra|ordinary genui&s;es, as they are called, this kingdom has produced; but it &s;hould &s;eem that his talent was fire and not genius; and the greate&s;t admirers of COWLEY mu&s;t allow that whatever fervour, thought, conception, or other &s;triking quality there may be in his works there cannot be found the fainte&s;t ray of &s;olid immutable judgement.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP V. WALLER, THE THREE KILLIGREWS, AND OTWAY.</HEAD>
<P>WALLER, who was the rever&s;e of COWLEY, who &s;o far from &s;oaring &s;carcely crept, and who&s;e mu&s;e, in&s;tead of imbibing the <HI>aqua vitae</HI> of poetry was as in&s;ipid as that water which was his con&s;tant beverage, has a claim to be mentioned here on account of having brought on the &s;tage, with alterations, BEAU|MONT and FLETCHER's play called The <HI>Maid's Tragedy.</HI></P>
<P>I have no room here to &s;hew in what manner WALLER contrived all his life to gain the favour of oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts; by what means he e&s;caped puni&s;hment for having been concerned in a plot in &s;avour of the king; how he managed always to be in parliament; how he made the pliable materials that had been acceptable to CHARLES the fir&s;t, ac|ceptable to CROMWELL, and afterwards to CHAR|LES the &s;econd; how he &s;ound means da&s;tardly to de&s;ert his friends and patrons in di&s;tre&s;s, and to
<PB N="86" REF="86">
po&s;&s;e&s;s their favour in pro&s;perity; the&s;e are above the arts of an ordinary man, but they are beneath the dignity of an hone&s;t one.</P>
<P>WALLER's famous an&s;wer to CHARLES the &s;e|cond, when he pointed out the di&s;parity between the panegyric on CROMWELL and the congratulation on his re&s;toration, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Poets &s;ucceed better in fiction than in truth,"</Q>
was as unworthy the poet as the man and &s;hews there was le&s;s art in the crime than in its ju&s;tification. Poetry has nothing to do with literal fiction, it only employs figurative fiction to embelli&s;h literal truth.</P>
<P>Was this the part WALLER took upon this oc|ca&s;ion? No; his conduct was ba&s;e and venal. After &s;peaking, writing, and acting, in defence of his in|jured king, while there was a chance of redre&s;s for him, in which ca&s;e the poet would have reaped the reward of pro&s;tituted prai&s;e, for &s;urely prai&s;e &s;o attained is pro&s;tituted, the moment the royal influ|ence began to droop, by means of colonel SCROOP, who had married his &s;i&s;ter, and his own mother, who was related both to CROMWELL and to HAMPDEN, he attempted at conciliating the u&s;urper's favour and &s;ucceeded. His favourable and dutiful &s;entiments towards his king were in&s;tantly lo&s;t and forgotten. He not only framed the panegyric in which he
<PB N="87" REF="87">
tacitly ju&s;tifies the de&s;truction of the church, the murder of the king, and the tumult and oppre&s;&s;ion in which the nation were involved, but he followed up, not the effu&s;ion of a poet, but the dark, con|certed, meditated de&s;ign of a rebel to his country, by his poem on the war with SPAIN, in which he both attempts to induce the nation to offer the u&s;urper the crown, and u&s;es every po&s;&s;ible in&s;inu|ating argument to procure his acceptance of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This CROMWELL, from motives of policy, refu&s;ed; but, to prove that his intention was to rule as a de&s;potic monarch, he pro|jected at this time his curious expedition again&s;t SPAIN in hopes to be enabled by foreign &s;poil, to e&s;tabli&s;h his government in what form and upon what principle he might think proper, without having re|cour&s;e to coun&s;els or parliaments; and for this projected &s;cheme he is &s;aid, ab&s;urdly enough without doubt, to have taken a hint from one of DAVENANT's plays.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He takes the moment when the nation is warm after the Spani&s;h defeat and &s;ays,
<Q><L>Let the brave generals divide that bough,</L>
<L>Our great Protector has &s;uch wreaths enough:</L>
<L>His conquering head has no more room for bays:</L>
<L>Then let it be as the glad nation prays;</L>
<L>Let the rich ore forewith be melted down,</L>
<L>And the &s;tate fixed by making him a crown:</L>
<L>With ermine clad, and purple, let him hold</L>
<L>A royal &s;eptre, made of Spani&s;h gold.</L></Q></P>
<P>The poetry of WALLER was greatly admired in its time, for it was inovation, introduced with &s;o
<PB N="88" REF="88">
much the more cunning as that it &s;eemed to &s;et up nature again&s;t art. The metaphy&s;ical poetry had wound up a&s;toni&s;hment till the &s;tring cracked; and WALLER, to a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf an air of originality, hoped to get immortal fame by reconciling poetry to truth and nature; but, unfortunately, not having &s;oul enough for the undertaking, he became very &s;oon what the painters call a manneri&s;t, and &s;at him|&s;elf down contentedly under an idea that he had arrived to the utmo&s;t perfection in the imitation of nature, whereas he ought to have con&s;idered that nature is inimitable. In &s;hort, as COWLEY har|monized his numbers out of their melody, WAL|LER melodized his out of their harmony; and thus, by neglecting every thing nervous and &s;pirited, his venal productions excepted, which are de&s;pi&s;ed an|other way, he has left nothing behind him but an ingenious and elegant collection of lullabies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Maid's Tragedy</HI> was altered by WALLER from BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, but had little &s;ucce&s;s. He points out in the prologue how the audience may di&s;tingui&s;h between his writing and that of the original authors.<Q><L>In this old play, what's new we have expre&s;&s;ed</L>
<L>In rhiming ver&s;e, di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t</L>
<L>That as the Rhone its ha&s;ty way does make</L>
<L>(Not mingling waters) through Geneva's lake</L>
<L>So, having here the different &s;tyles in view.</L>
<L>You may compare the former with the new.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="89">This is enough to &s;hew that it is a &s;trange patch|work bu&s;ine&s;s, which it turned out, for it was &s;oon withdrawn and has never been re&s;umed.</P>
<P>WALLER al&s;o made &s;ome alterations, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the earl of DORSET, in Mrs. PHILIPS's tragedy of <HI>Pompey;</HI> which, at the in&s;tance of lord ORRERY &s;he had tran&s;lated from CORNEILLE. The lady took offence at this and in revenge ridi|culed WALLER's double rhimes, and it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed &s;ucce&s;sfully enough. Indeed the&s;e and others were points in which this poet might ea&s;ily have been a&s;&s;ailed. His numbers are &s;mooth in general, though &s;eldom mu&s;ical, but his rhimes are weak, the expletive do frequently occurs, and there are many other radical objections to his poetry. Hyperbole may be vaped as well as poignant; labouring at tri&s;lles to make them important turns to dullne&s;s; in &s;hort, if COWLEY's mu&s;e was a coquette and a romp, WALLER's was a prude and full of mock mode&s;ty; and thus in different ways they equally di&s;gu&s;t; one is bold, the other preci&s;e; one carele&s;s, volatile, and forward, attracts only a tran&s;ient re|gard; the other conceited, &s;elf &s;ufficient, vain and hypocritical, &s;oon experiences, in &s;pight of the little regard &s;he had attracted, cold neglect, and palling indifference.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="90">During the reigns of CHARLES the fir&s;t and CHARLES the &s;econd, flouri&s;hed three KILLI|GREWS, &s;ons of &s;ir ROBERT KILLIGREW, or KIL|LEGREW, all of them play-wrights, and in other re|&s;pects men of &s;ome celebrity. Sir WILLIAM KILLIGREW, the elder brother, was a very con|&s;picuous adherent of CHARLES the fir&s;t. He was very early made governor of Pendennis Ca&s;tle in Falmouth Haven, and put in command of the whole We&s;tern militia.</P>
<P>After this he was brought to court and placed immediately about the king's per&s;on, and he had the command of two troops of guards for the &s;afety of his royal ma&s;ter during the war with the parlia|ment. He became, however, an ob&s;cure character in the general troubles, and we know but little of him till CHARLES the &s;econd, anxious to &s;hew at|tention to an old &s;ervant of his father, or as &s;ome &s;ay out of regard to his brother THOMAS, for CHARLES was not remarkable for gratitude, re|&s;tored him to the po&s;t of gentleman u&s;her of the privy chamber, which he had held under the late king, and afterwards created him the queen's vice chamberlain, which honourable &s;ituation he en|joyed twenty-two years, during which time the world are indebted to him, be&s;ides other literary produc|tions, for f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ive dramatic pieces.</P>

<P>THOMAS KILLIGREW, commonly known by the name of king CHARLES's je&s;ter, produced ten plays.

He had &s;uch lively parts, and was a man of &s;uch ex|centricity and peculiar humour that he was a perfect counterpart to CHARLES; and, having been ad|mitted to habits of freedom and familiarity during their re&s;idence abroad, he was &s;uffered to go &s;ome|times mo&s;t unwarrantable lengths in the liberties he took, There is a &s;tory told that he came to the king dre&s;&s;ed like a pilgrim; and, being a&s;ked where he was going, he an&s;wered to fetch OLIVER CROM|WELL from hell to take care of the affairs of the nation, for that his &s;ucce&s;&s;or took no care at all of them.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="93">His plays &s;eems not at all to have been per|formed, and &s;ome of them appear to have been brought out at &s;ir WILLIAM DAVENANT's theatre, which completely di&s;credits his having been ma|nager of the king's company. The <HI>Pri&s;oners,</HI> 1663, was a tragedy, but we know nothing of its &s;ucce&s;s. On this play and <HI>Claracilla,</HI> a tragi-comedy, &s;ome recommendatory ver&s;es are &s;aid to have been written by CARTWRIGHT, and others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prince&s;s,</HI> tragi-comedy, which was written at NAPLES, is a romantic thing and was taken from a traditional Neapolitan &s;tory. The <HI>Pilgrim</HI> was written at PARIS, but is very little calculated for repre&s;entation. The <HI>Par&s;on's Wedding.</HI> This co|medy was certainly performed fir&s;t in 1664, but whether by DAVENANT's company or KILLI|GREW's we have no account; and now, to make amends for the want of women on the &s;tage previous to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e companies, it was re|vived at the the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Field's, and performed entirely by women, with a new pro|logue and epilogue, &s;poken by Mrs. MARSHALL in men's cloaths.</P>
<P>By this play we pretty well get at KILLIGLEW's real merit, which &s;eems to have been no more than a general predilection for literature, and perhaps
<PB N="94" REF="94">
dramatic literature in particular. The <HI>Par&s;on's Wedding,</HI> with the help of the &s;ci&s;&s;ars and the pa&s;te pot, is little more than a mixture of The <HI>Antiquary, Ram Alley,</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h Rogue,</HI> and other things which furni&s;hed the materials afterwards for <HI>Woman's a Riddle,</HI> a play which, as we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter, BULLOCK and SAVAGE held a di&s;puted right in; but which came, and indeed &s;o did all the re&s;t, from a Spani&s;h play called <HI>La Dama Duende,</HI> which was tran&s;lated by Mrs. PRICE, wife to one of the Barons of the Exchequer. It is a &s;prightly comedy, and when you have &s;aid that you have &s;aid all.</P>

The&s;e were written abroad, and one of them appears to have been performed at DAVENANT's theatre in 1664. <HI>Thoma&s;o, or the Wanderer,</HI> is a comedy al&s;o in two parts, or rather two comedies on the &s;ame &s;ubject, one of the&s;e was performed, &s;ome &s;ay they were both. The plot is &s;tolen from various things, one part of it in particular from JONSON's <HI>Volpone,</HI> and another from a poem of CAREW, which theft KIL|LIGREW acknowledges. The&s;e plays, together with two others on one &s;ubject called <HI>Bellamira her Dream,</HI> were all publi&s;hed in 1664.</P>
<P>Dr. HENRY KILLIGREW was a year younger
<PB N="95" REF="95">
than his brother THOMAS. He got early into high preferment in the church, for at the age of thirty he had taken the degree of Doctor of Divinity, and was immediately appointed chaplain to the duke of YORK, and given a &s;tall in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey. He was like his brothers, faithful to the Royal Fa|mily, and &s;uffered with them; but, on the re&s;toration he was made almoner to the duke of YORK, &s;u|perintendant of his chapel, rector of Wheatham&s;ted in HERTFORDSHIRE, and ma&s;ter of the Savoy, which place he retained fifty years.</P>
<P>As this is the only HENRY KILLIGREW of eminence that we know of at that time, it has been naturally conjectured that he was the patentee, but there is certainly no credible rea&s;on to be given for this &s;urmi&s;e. It is true that he was a long time &s;ta|tionary and might have attended to any pur&s;uit of that kind; but he would in &s;uch ca&s;e probably have embelli&s;hed his theatre with his writing, having given one very good &s;pecimen of his dramatic abilities, and again &s;uch an undertaking might have been con&s;idered as incompatible with the &s;anctity of his character.</P>
<P>The only play he produced was written at the age of &s;eventeen, and it was con&s;idered as a very extraordinary effort. It was written for the enter|tainment

<P>We are now come to OTWAY, a weak and un|fortunate man, and a great and extraordinary writer.
<PB N="97" REF="97">
OTWAY, though liberally educated, &s;eems to have been poor from his infancy. He early in life com|menced actor and completely failed. It has been generally agreed that writing and acting depend upon different faculties. That per&s;on, demeanour, face, and voice, ought to be always at the command of an actor is beyond contradiction; and, when it &s;o happens that an actor fails in the&s;e requi&s;ites it is clearly impo&s;&s;ible that he can acquire reputation on the &s;tage; but there is &s;omething al&s;o in mind, con|ception, and knowledge of nature and the heart; which, if an author manife&s;ts in his writings an actor is compelled to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>It has been remarked, by way of &s;etting the matter right, that the author has watched the heart, and the actor contemplated the face; but I cannot narrow the que&s;tion to &s;o thin a conclu&s;ion. Is it unnece&s;&s;ary then that an actor &s;hould feel and think? Is action and ge&s;ticulation all the requi&s;ites he has occa&s;ion for? Will any body venture to declare this who has &s;een GARRICK in Lear, or Hamlet, BARRY in Othello, SHUTER in the Mi&s;er, MACKLIN in Shylock, KING in Lord Ogleby, Mrs. CLIVE in the Widow Blackacre, or Mrs. SIDDONS in Mrs. Beverley, or the Grecian Daughter?

care whence the in&s;tances come &s;o they are but &s;trong and in nature.</P>
<P>Upon occa&s;ions like the&s;e, actors will &s;ometimes give a force and a truth to a character beyond what the author him&s;elf had conceived, and I could name literal in&s;tances of it. Let it not then be credited that an actor is but a mere vehicle, a conveyance. Many that pa&s;s for actors indeed are but little more but the eminent requi&s;ites are &s;trongly mental, and require a great deal that good authors have, and a great deal that they want; and it is upon this ac|count that, while the &s;tage has been inundated by authors for two hundred years, many of them men of great talents, the world has &s;een but one BET|TERTON, and one GARRICK.</P>
<P>OTWAY was perpetually in all manner of di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;quiet. His ea&s;ine&s;s of temper made him too kind, and his poverty too accommodating; and thus he was always wa&s;ting his wit for the amu&s;ement of wealthy fools, and accepting his reckoning by way of recompence. His companions were pro&s;ligate men, &s;uch as would bring him into &s;crapes and there leave him. One of the&s;e my lord PLYMOUTH, an illegitimate &s;on of CHARLES the &s;econd, pro|cured him a cornet's commi&s;&s;ion and &s;ent him into

<P>It was at this time he was illiberally handled by ROCHESTER in his <HI>Se&s;&s;ion of the Poets;</HI> but he went on di&s;&s;ipating what he had, and &s;triving to earn more, to follow the &s;ame game, in which he played a deep &s;take indeed; for he lo&s;t his health, his in|dependancy, and his con&s;equence; till, at length, before he had attained his thirty fifth year, &s;unk into the mo&s;t abject poverty, hunted by inexorable cre|ditors, de&s;erted by all the world, and loath&s;ome to him&s;elf, he died, as we are told, by &s;wallowing part of a roll which he was enabled to purcha&s;e by the ca&s;ual charity of a per&s;on who met him and had known him in better days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. JOHNSON with great propriety has taken &s;ome pains to a&s;certain the probab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lity of this fact.

For the &s;ake of humanity let us admit this account rather than the other.

But this, &s;evere as it is in the eye of a a &s;uperficial reader, is mere cavil.

<HEAD>CHAP VI. DENHAM, FLECKNOE, COCKAYNE, THE HOWARDS, LORD FALKLAND, SIR GEORGE ETHERIDGE, Mrs. PHILIPS, BUCKINGHAM, DUFFET, RYMER, AND SUCKLING.</HEAD>
<P>AS I now count one hundred and thirty eight dra|matic writers not yet mentioned, who&s;e works were written before the revolution, it will be very proper in &s;ome way to clear them off, that the &s;tage may be at lei&s;ure for DRYDEN and other authors of more eminence.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with a few which I can dwell on with propriety as their names are de&s;ervedly held in e&s;teem. Sir JOHN DENHAM, one of tho&s;e who began to refine Engli&s;h poetry from the &s;lights and hyperboles of COWLEY and his metaphy&s;ical ad|herents, merits a place any where to his celebration, but his title to notice in this work ari&s;es from his having written a tragedy called The <HI>Sophy.</HI> I &s;hall
<PB N="101" REF="110">
not, however, lo&s;e the plea&s;ure this opportunity gives me of &s;peaking further of him.</P>
<P>DENHAM, who as an author very gravely tells us, an Iri&s;hman probably, that being &s;on to the lord chief baron of the exchequer in IRELAND, he was of cour&s;e born in DUBLIN, maintained a con&s;picuous character in &s;ociety. Being violently addicted to gaming his friends had very little hopes of his ever making any con&s;iderable figure notwith&s;tanding every pains was taken with his education, and every advantage given him as to polite and elegant ac|compli&s;hments; nor did they dream that &s;uch a a &s;park lay under &s;uch a heap of rubbi&s;h, till all of a &s;udden he brought forward his tragedy of the <HI>Sophy</HI> at the age of twenty-&s;even.</P>
<P>WALLER upon this occa&s;ion &s;aid that DEN|HAM
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"broke out like the Iri&s;h rebellion, three &s;core thou&s;and &s;trong when nobody was aware or at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected it."</Q>
Soon after this he publi&s;hed <HI>Cooper's Hill,</HI> a poem that had &s;o much merit as to <Q REND="inline">"excite,"</Q> &s;ays doctor JOHNSON,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the common artifice by which envy degrades excellence. A re|port was &s;pread that the poem was not his own but that he had bought it of a vicar for forty pounds."</Q>
The &s;ame attempt was made to rob

<P>The fine&s;t traits in the character of DENHAM are tho&s;e which de&s;cribe him as a &s;taunch, warm, and dutiful loyali&s;t. The &s;ervices he engaged in were full of difficulty and per&s;onal danger, yet he braved them to &s;erve the injured king and his un|fortunate family. He undertook to deliver a me&s;|&s;age from the queen to the king when he was in cu&s;tody of the army, he rai&s;ed ten thou&s;and pounds for him among his Scotti&s;h &s;ubjects in POLAND, and he conveyed away JAMES, duke of YORK, from LONDON into FRANCE, and delivered him there to his mother and brother.</P>
<P>At the Re&s;toration he was rewarded for his for|mer &s;ervices and grew into opulence, and he now in|dulged him&s;elf in his own proper &s;phere; to how good a purpo&s;e let his various productions &s;hew which GARTH and POPE have imitated, and which gave a poli&s;h to DRYDEN.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sophy</HI> is built upon a &s;tory in HERBERT's <HI>Travels,</HI> treated al&s;o by BARON, but as he and DENHAM pur&s;ued the &s;ubject differently each author has been a&s;&s;igned his &s;eparate merit, DENHAM, how|ever,
<PB N="112" REF="112">
claims the right of originality, having written his play five years before BARON's piece was produced. They were both &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>FLECKNOE is a name which would now perhaps have been forgotton had not DRYDEN handed it down to po&s;terity in a different way than the gen|tleman's own vanity perhaps induced him to think it intitled to. LANGBAINE whim&s;ically &s;ays that his acquaintance with the nobility was more than with the Mu&s;es, and that he had a greater pro|pen&s;ity to rhiming than a genius to poetry. He printed &s;everal plays but never could get but one performed, for which he him&s;elf gives different rea&s;ons. <Q REND="inline">"Tho&s;e,"</Q> &s;ays he,

<P>The only play of this author that was acted is a pa&s;toral tragi-comedy. It was in&s;tantly damned, and FLECKNOE, a Je&s;uit him&s;elf, and following the je&s;uitical conduct of JONSON upon a like occa&s;ion,

<HI>Erminia, De&s;moi&s;elles ala Mode,</HI> and The <HI>Marriage of Oceanus and Britannia,</HI> were never performed.

<P>Sir ASTON COCKAYNE, who knew polite li|terature, and encouraged it, who in common with many other gentlemen of liberal principles and abilities, &s;uffered in the political &s;torm that &s;hip|wrecked the fortunes of CHARLES the fir&s;t, and re|turned to pa&s;s the latter part of his life in peace and &s;erenity after the re&s;toration, wrote four plays.</P>

<P><HI>A Ma&s;que for Twelfth Night,</HI> was an occa&s;ional thing performed before PHILIP earl of CHESTER|FIELD and his lady, in which their two &s;ons repre|&s;ented the principal characters; which may &s;hew that the CHESTERFIELDS had always an eye to the Graces, though the elde&s;t of them, who afterwards &s;o loudly inveighed again&s;t a nobleman's making him&s;elf a fidler, probably took the hint from his be|ing forced &s;o early in life, for no doubt it was again&s;t his will, to turn actor.</P>
<P><HI>Ovid's Tragedy</HI> is another in&s;tance that COCK|AYNE was infected with a love of the Italian theatre, a ta&s;te than which nothing can be more fal&s;e, though there is always &s;omething that intere&s;ts and amu&s;es. Some of the circum&s;tances are taken from a piece which BEAUMONT and FLETHCHER have imitated in <HI>King and no King,</HI> and which &s;eems to have
<PB N="115" REF="115">
formed the ground work for the <HI>Revenge.</HI> HAN|NIBAL's inviting the dead carca&s;s to &s;up with him is that revolting &s;ubject <HI>Don John,</HI> which we have been obliged to &s;ay too much of already.</P>
<P>Of the name of HOWARD we have three au|thors, EDWARD, JAMES, and &s;ir ROBERT, all gen|tlemen of fortune and family, though it does not appear, whatever might have been &s;aid to the con|trary, that they were related. There is nothing very particular mentioned of their fortunes; and, though they each of them wrote for the &s;tage, except one hit, their works are very little known, I allude to The <HI>Committee, or the Faithful Iri&s;hman.</HI></P>
<P>This comedy was written by &s;ir ROBERT HOW|ARD, and &s;ucceeded very greatly on account of its being a play for the times, for it was intended to ca&s;t an odium on the Round Heads and their party, which certainly the ab&s;urd fanatici&s;m, mixed with in|decent pride, in Mr. and Mrs. DAY and ABEL has completely effected. The idea of TEAGUE was taken from his own &s;ervant who was &s;ent to EN|GLAND to relea&s;e &s;ir ROBERT's &s;on from pri&s;on, where he was at the &s;uit of government; and hav|ing &s;ucceeded, in&s;tead of going immediately to his ma&s;ter on his return to IRELAND, he &s;taid a fort|night
<PB N="116" REF="116">
to &s;pread the news and get drunk among his friends for joy.</P>
<P>The remainder of the dramatic pieces written by this gentleman are called, The <HI>Blind Lady,</HI> The <HI>Surprizal,</HI> The <HI>Ve&s;tal Virgin,</HI> The <HI>Indian Queen,</HI> The <HI>Great Favourite,</HI> and The <HI>Conque&s;t of China by the Tartars</HI>; none of which have any thing in them very remarkable, except the <HI>Ve&s;tal Virgin,</HI> which has two cata&s;trophes; one ending happy, and the other tragical, &s;o that the play may be performed either way according to the choice of the audience.</P>
<P>The plays written by EDWARD HOWARD are, The <HI>U&s;urper, Six Days Adventure, Woman's Con|que&s;t, Man of New Market, The Change of Crowns,</HI> The <HI>London Gentleman,</HI> and the <HI>United Kingdom,</HI> none of which we learn much of, and &s;ome of them were never printed. <HI>Six Days Adventure</HI> &s;eems to have had &s;ome merit, for it excited lord RO|CHESTER's envy and ill nature; two qualities very irritable in this &s;arca&s;tic humouri&s;t.</P>
<P>JAMES HOWARD wrote <HI>All Mi&s;taken,</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h Mon&s;ieur,</HI> and <HI>Romeo and Juliet.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e is a comedy, and may be found in DODSLEY's collection of old Plays. It has a great
<PB N="117" REF="117">
deal of &s;prightline&s;s, and &s;hews indeed that he was the be&s;t dramatic author of the three, though he has written le&s;s than the others. The &s;econd has merit, but it has plenty of defects, and is that very comedy that the duke of BUCKINGHAM ridiculed in the <HI>Rehear&s;al,</HI> in the circum&s;tance of prince VOLSIUS and the &s;ingle boot. In the third, this gentleman tried the effect of his name-&s;ake's experiment, for he altered <HI>Romeo and Juliet</HI> &s;o as to make it end happily, and by this expedient DAVENANT gave it a run, repre&s;enting it according to SHAKESPEAR and according to HOWARD alternately.</P>
<P>Lord FALKLAND was an amateur rather than a writer, but his &s;pirit and inclination to protect and patronize genius have made him the theme of many a poet's &s;incere panegyric. He is entitled to a place here having written one play which was called The <HI>Marriage Night,</HI> and which is &s;aid to have contained a great &s;hare of wit and &s;atire. There is but one opinion of this amiable and benevolent nobleman, and the true&s;t te&s;t of his virtues is that he was regretted after his death by many who felt the good effects of his bounty when living.</P>
<P>There is nothing that di&s;tingui&s;hes the life of &s;ir GEORGE ETHERIDGE from the other men of plea|&s;ure
<PB N="118" REF="118">
in his time, except that, though he was as fond of the &s;ame pur&s;uits, he had more principle. We &s;ee no gro&s;s violation of honour, no &s;hamele&s;s im|piety in him; for, in his free&s;t moments of levity, there was an elegance of &s;entiment, and his conduct was always gallantry but rarely libertini&s;m. His works are dangerous, for they are full of licentiou&s;|ne&s;s; and, though his images are true, they are too lively and glowing, particularly for either the ear or the eye of young females; therefore his comedies, which are in other re&s;pects well written and a &s;trong picture of elegant life, have long di&s;appeared from the &s;tage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Comical Revenge, She Would if &s;he Could,</HI> and The <HI>Man of Mode,</HI> are the titles of his plays; and, except that the fir&s;t is written partly in heroic ver&s;e, an examination of one would &s;erve for all. They are lively and engaging, and exhibit a faithful picture of nature; but it is nature in her loo&s;e&s;t attire, and when none love to court her but the licentious. SHADWELL &s;peaks highly of <HI>She Would if &s;he Could,</HI> though DENNIS &s;ays it was barbarou&s;ly treated by the audience. The <HI>Man of Mode</HI> is cer|tainly the be&s;t play; in which the characters of DORIMANT and &s;ir FOPLING FLUTTER are ma&s;|terly drawn, and highly coloured; but the objection
<PB N="119" REF="119">
of indecency and indecorum applies to this play as well as the others, a circum&s;tance highly in favour of CIBBER, who&s;e fine gentleman and fops are well fini&s;hed copies from the paintings of ETHERIDGE.</P>
<P>Mrs. PHILIPS, or, according the to title of her poems,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the mo&s;t de&s;ervedly admired Mrs. CATHERINE PHILIPS, the matchle&s;s ORINDA,"</Q>
wrote two tragedies called <HI>Pompey,</HI> and <HI>Horace.</HI> There is nothing &s;o ea&s;y as for ladies to acquire the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a little negative fame who are flattered into an idea that they can write. As for tho&s;e who&s;e minds are &s;o male that they might as well be male in every other re&s;pect, that decide upon the rights of nations and mankind, and pretinaciou&s;ly obtrude them&s;elves into a province for which they cannot be qualified either by nature or education, one readily pities them exactly as one commi&s;erates any other de&s;cription of the in&s;ane<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor JOHNSON, who was an admirable lurcher at watching for an opportunity to revenge him&s;elf, had been long an admirer of Mrs MACAULEY; but finding her get almo&s;t as dogmatic as him&s;elf, and &s;eeing plainly that he might dine with her to all eternity without being able to convince her, was determined to cut her up at once by lowering her pride completely; for which purpo&s;e he one day art|fully drew her into conver&s;ation upon her favourite topic the rights of man, in which were of cour&s;e included liberty and equality.

<P>As to the lady in que&s;tion, &s;he &s;eems to have been in circum&s;tances beyond the general run of lady writers, and therefore, as &s;he had nothing el&s;e to do, there was no more good or harm in her &s;tuffing her head full of her own poetry than the poetry of other people. Her mo&s;t celebrated work, however, is in pro&s;e, and con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;eries of let|ters &s;he wrote to &s;ir CHARLES COTTEREL, under the title of <HI>Letters from Orinda to Poliarchus,</HI> and we are commanded to believe, though the friend&s;hip of tho&s;e letters is &s;omething warmer than the love of people in general, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they are an intercour&s;e between two per&s;ons of different &s;exes managed with delight and innocence,"</Q>
to which I &s;hall only &s;ay that if the hu&s;band was &s;atisfied nobody el&s;e had a right to complain.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="121">The two tragedies by Mrs. PHILIPS are tran&s;lations from CORNEILLE. <HI>Horace</HI> was left unfini&s;hed and afterwards &s;upplied with a fifth act by &s;ir JOHN DEN|HAM. It was performed by per&s;ons of quality at court with a prologue &s;poken by the duke of Monmouth. COTTON had tran&s;lated the &s;ame play &s;ix years before, which induced the world to believe that Mrs. PHILIPS had taken advantage of his play; but the fact is, they were both very nearly from the French, and CORNEILLE, if not injured, would look well in any language. As to <HI>Pompee</HI> I have already &s;hewn that it begat a &s;parring match between this lady and Mr. WALLER; and, as all the world of gallantry at that time &s;wore and maintained that the Le&s;bian SAPHO, and the Roman SULPITIA were nothing to Mrs. PHILIPS, the double rhimes of poor WALLER were of cour&s;e decried to nothing, and the double entendres of the lady extolled to the &s;kies.</P>
<P>GEORGE VILLIERS, duke of Buckingham, was &s;on to that famous &s;tate&s;man and favourite of CHARLES the fir&s;t, who too fatally in&s;pired his ma&s;ter with the weakne&s;s of JAMES, and who, in return, lo&s;t his life by the hands of FELTON. The character of BUCKINGHAM, of whom we are &s;peaking, was exactly &s;imilar to all tho&s;e men of
<PB N="122" REF="122">
di&s;tinction about CHARLES the &s;econd; who, in compliance with the follies and vices of that weak and profligate monarch, threw a veil of French li|centiou&s;ne&s;s over that &s;plendour of Engli&s;h talents which would otherwi&s;e have adorned this reign of unavailing merit and perverted genius.</P>
<P>CHARLES the &s;econd, unfortunately for the king|dom, drew in French folly with his milk. The bulk of his adherents, who were his followers in his di&s;tre&s;s, and his companions in his exile, by the ex|ample of their principal, perfected them&s;elves in tho&s;e principles mo&s;t congenial to his wi&s;hes upon the &s;pot where &s;uch an education was practically taught. In con&s;equence of this they all returned to ENGLAND accompli&s;hed French courtiers, and hence aro&s;e the &s;uperficial ta&s;te and unprincipled levity that eclip&s;ed every thing meritorious, and ri|diculed every thing honourable.</P>
<P>This BUCKINGMAM did his utmo&s;t, to &s;ay the truth of him, to connive at. He was a weak, ir|re&s;olute, unprincipled man; but the &s;tronge&s;t mark of his character was ingratitude, particularly to the king, again&s;t whom he was for ever &s;tudying every &s;ort of mi&s;chief. In &s;hort, he lived in mi&s;erable &s;plendour, an object of torment and vexation to
<PB N="123" REF="123">
him&s;elf and every body el&s;e, and died, like RO|CHESTER, and indeed mo&s;t unprincipled characters, afraid of his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>BUCKINGHAM wrote, as all the world knows, the famous burle&s;que comedy called the <HI>Rehear&s;al;</HI> a piece in its way that never was equaled. Its drift was by no means unfair, though he gave him&s;elf a licence which he &s;ometimes made an improper u&s;e of. Bomba&s;t and &s;u&s;tian in heroic rhime were cer|tainly fair objects for &s;atire, but it was the affectation of the reigning ta&s;te, the origin of which I have ju&s;t &s;hewn, that created this perver&s;ion of talents, and it would have been wi&s;er to have reformed it altogether than to have ridiculed men who could not have dined had they not pro&s;tituted their merit.</P>
<P>DUFFET was a kind of &s;tage adventurer, who, fancying he had a turn for dramatic poetry, and finding his works generally hi&s;&s;ed into oblivion, determined to take &s;ome other cour&s;e to induce a good reception of his pieces. That which he hit on was ingenious enough, and &s;eems to have been the ground work of a &s;imilar expedient afterwards practi&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s in France. In &s;hort, DUFFET, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to write any thing he
<PB N="124" REF="124">
did not expo&s;e to ridicule, thought it le&s;s mortifying to ridicule the productions of others, and thus as fa&s;t as a piece made its appearance at the Duke's theatre, he parodied it at the King's. His own plays which &s;carcely de&s;erve notice were called The <HI>Spani&s;h Rogue,</HI> The <HI>Empre&s;s of Morocco,</HI> and <HI>Beauty's Triumph.</HI> The re&s;t were written to ridicule other authors, and, to &s;hew what an appropriate choice he made, the whole force of his &s;atire is levelled at SHAKESPEAR and SHADWELL.</P>
<P>RYMER, who&s;e character as a critic is differently drawn, who by &s;ome is thought to have written on the productions of authors with truth, di&s;cernment, candour, and di&s;crimination, but by many more with a&s;perity, ignorance, envy, and malignity, wrote one bad tragedy called <HI>Edgar.</HI></P>
<P>SUCKLING, a perfect gentleman, who, by the advantages of birth, per&s;on, education, genius, and fortune, would probably have arrived to con&s;iderable eminence as a literary character had not death un|timely cut him off at the age of twenty-eight, wrote four plays him&s;elf, and patronized many others.</P>
<P>His plays are publi&s;hed together with his poems, &s;peeches, tracts and letters; and by the&s;e it is very
<PB N="125" REF="125">
ea&s;y to de&s;cern that he had &s;trong genius and much poetical grace, which would have matured his la|bours probably, had he lived into &s;omething more accompl&s;hed; but there is evidently every where marks of youth and inexperience, although WAL|LER certainly had him in view, for what was &s;tudy and art in WALLER, was ea&s;e and nature in SUCKLING.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of SUCKLING's plays was called The <HI>Di&s;contented Colonel,</HI> but in that &s;tate it was only a &s;ketch of what he afterwards enlarged into a tragedy called <HI>Brenoralt.</HI> The <HI>Goblins,</HI> 1646, which DODS|LEY has publi&s;hed in his collection, has &s;ome very &s;trong traits of merit. SUCKLING &s;eems to have had a variety of things in his head when he conceived the plot, and he has not at any time lo&s;t &s;ight of the <HI>Tempe&s;t;</HI> but it cannot be &s;aid in any part to be &s;o much plagiary as a general imitation of the &s;ame &s;ort of &s;tyle, and this only in the characters; for there is a novelty in the incidents that might be rendered very plea&s;ing.</P>
<P><HI>Aglaura,</HI> 1646, &s;eems to have been imitated by HOWARD in his <HI>Ve&s;tal Virgin;</HI> not as to the &s;ub|ject but on account of its having a happy and a tragic cata&s;trophe. The <HI>Sad One</HI> was left unfini&s;hed,
<PB N="126" REF="126">
but it is a &s;ketch in which may be &s;een a good deal of the ma&s;ter. <HI>Brenoralt</HI> was his la&s;t but it has not the greate&s;t merit, and, upon the whole, the <HI>Goblins</HI> is the be&s;t play. To that I refer tho&s;e who cannot readily get at his whole works, in which will be found if not great perfection at lea&s;t great pro|mi&s;e, and it is very much to be regretted the world lo&s;t &s;o early in life a genius &s;o likely to contribute to its plea&s;ure, and a man &s;o qualified to embelli&s;h its &s;ociety.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP VII. DUKE AND DUCHESS OF NEWCASTLE, CARELL, HAUSTED, GLAPTHORNE, CAREW, AND OTHER WRITERS TO THE NUMBER OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;o many dramatic authors yet remain to be mentioned who di&s;appeared before the Revolution, my account of them mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be very brief, and indeed it would be an intru&s;ion on the reader were it otherwi&s;e, for it &s;hould &s;eem that every thing that was brought to the theatres, good and bad, was in&s;tantly produced, and therefore a great deal of it was of cour&s;e in&s;ufferable tra&s;h. To &s;ay truth, it is le&s;s a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment than curio&s;ity that out of nearly five hundred dramatic pieces which were written by various authors in &s;omething more than thirty years, except a very few, perhaps ten, and tho&s;e in an altered &s;tate, the &s;tage is a total &s;tranger to the whole catalogue.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="128">WILLIAM CAVENDISH, duke of Newca&s;tle, who&s;e remarkable attachment to JAMES the fir&s;t, CHARLES the fir&s;t and CHARLES the &s;econd, for which he obtained his titles and honours, outwent all their other adherents, who with a&s;toning equa|nimity of temper &s;u&s;tained many extraordinary vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of fortune, and who among other proofs of his merit was highly gifted and elegantly accom|pli&s;hed, wrote four comedies, which were called The <HI>Country Captain, Variety,</HI> The <HI>Triumphant Widow,</HI> and The <HI>Humourous Lovers.</HI> The&s;e plays have been a good deal extolled; perhaps be|cau&s;e the author was a duke. They are pa&s;&s;able, and no doubt he who wrote them held them in no better e&s;teem; for poetry, though he was a noble patron and &s;trongly encouraged and promoted the intere&s;t of literature, never &s;o obtruded it&s;elf as to di&s;turb his public occupations. The <HI>Triumphant Widow</HI> had good materials, and &s;o perfectly was SHADWELL of his mind, that many parts of his <HI>Bury Fair</HI> are literally tran&s;cribed from it.</P>
<P>If the Duke, however, did not let poetry im|properly engro&s;s his time, the Duche&s;s to be even with him &s;ubmitted to hardly any other occupation. She married the Duke, then Marquis of NEW|CASTLE, when they were both in exile. They re|turned

They are chiefly tran&s;lations from other authors, and <HI>Haraclitus</HI> is a tran&s;lation from COR|NEILLE.</P>
<P>HAUSTED was a cotemporary and boon-com|panion of RANDOLPH. He wrote two dramatic pieces called The <HI>Rival Friends,</HI> and <HI>Senile Odium,</HI> which met with very little &s;ucce&s;s though hi&s;torians, and particularly LANGBAINE and WOOD, give this author the character of a good poet.</P>
<P>GLAPTHORNE, whom WINSTANLEY calls one of the chiefe&s;t poets in the reign of CHARLES the fir&s;t, has left nothing to be remembered by but five plays, for, though he wrote nine, four of them were never printed.

<P>CAREW was a celebrated wit in the reign of CHARLES the fir&s;t, and wrote at his expre&s;s com|mand, a ma&s;que called <HI>Coelum Britannicum.</HI> The mu&s;ic of this ma&s;que was compo&s;ed by HENRY LAWES, and the decorations were invented by INIGO JONES.

<P>Baron who wrote two dramatic pieces, and to whom, but I believe without the lea&s;t truth, are at|tributed four more and &s;everal interludes, was con|ver&s;ant with men of talents, and particularly intimate with the celebrated HOWELL, who the reader may re|member was a great traveller, and among who&s;e letters

<P>PEAPS. It is not certain that any &s;uch author ever lived, or if he lived, whether he wrote a play. There is a play, however, called <HI>Love in an Extacy,</HI> with this name to it, and the only extraordinary cir|cum&s;tance relative to it is that it has co&s;t more con|trover&s;y about it than the play is worth. Cox had very &s;lender preten&s;ions to be con&s;idered as an author, his whole merit having con&s;i&s;ted of taking diverting circum&s;tances from various plays and forming them into farces and drolls; which, be|ing a good actor, he was well qualified to do. This patched work bu&s;ine&s;s is not of &s;ufficient importance to merit the reader's attention, and, therefore, I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s it without enumerating the titles of this ma&s;s of mummery, a much larger catalogue of which were printed by KIRKMAN after the Re|&s;toration.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP VIII. DRYDEN.</HEAD>
<P>THE chequered life, opinions, character, and con|duct of DRYDEN, might furni&s;h an examination of extraordinary length which, in the hands of a candid &s;crutinizer, would be found, like this poets own writing, to con&s;i&s;t of beauties that will be admired for ever, and blemi&s;hes that &s;oon fade away.</P>
<P>DRYDEN &s;eems to have come forward into the world very peaceably, and to have deliberated on the part he was to &s;u&s;tain in life with a view, when he &s;hould find him&s;elf perfect, to &s;ubmit his merit to the opinion of the public; but he lived in an age of literary warfare, and he &s;oon found that, as he mu&s;t infallibly expo&s;e to the world the reigning folly by manife&s;ting tho&s;e talents which others wanted, he &s;hould be &s;urrounded by vanity, ig|norance, and envy, and a&s;&s;ailed by all the &s;lander re&s;ulting from &s;uch malignant pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="149">Had he made his election at once, in&s;tead of treading upon the&s;e reptiles, to have pa&s;&s;ed by with|out noticing them at all, they would have retired confounded; his foibles would not have been bla+zoned into faults; nor his faults magnified into vices. He would have appeared upon a par with other human beings in indi&s;cretion and frailty. but &s;uperior to them in tho&s;e nobler qualities with which nature rarely vouch&s;afes to endow the mind of man; but this requires a firmne&s;s, and a philo&s;ophy but little known to us; and, though pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s in &s;uch ca&s;es may be prudence, it is not nature. To return good for evil, taking it literally, is a virtue, but there is a &s;pice of quixoti&s;m in it and unfortunately it was not in DRYDEN's way to conquer windmills but to elucidate truth. In &s;hort, though a won|derful writer, he was a mere man, &s;ubject to all the pa&s;&s;ions and failings incident to his fellow creatures, and thus we &s;ee him immortalize dunces by conde|&s;cending to notice them, and degrading him&s;elf al|mo&s;t to their level by a ridiculous contention for a little cotemporary prai&s;e.</P>
<P>It were well if this were the wor&s;t. Contention begets a&s;perity; till, at length, a man receives into his own nature qualities that are not congenial to it. Intending only to explain, he gets into recrimi|nation,
<PB N="150" REF="150">
and de&s;erts his own defence by vilifying his adver&s;ary; and thus, having conde&s;cended to abu&s;e, he is upon a footing with his dirty competitor. Human nature here gets another fillup, and, while he endeavours to account for all the &s;lander thrown on him, he &s;eeks for precedents, and finds unfortu|nately for his candour, that his predece&s;&s;ors have not only &s;u&s;tained as much abu&s;e, but he fancies they de&s;erved more. Thus do the greate&s;t men become at times unju&s;t, and the be&s;t ungenerous; and thus has DRYDEN given SETTLE cau&s;e to exult by entering the li&s;ts with him, and thus has LANGBAINE rea&s;on to reproach him for &s;eeking out faults in the writings of SHAKESPEAR and his cotemporaries, which are much more glaring in his own. All this can be ea&s;ier accounted for than defended.</P>
<P>A man born like DRYDEN, with that fullne&s;s of genius, that elevation of &s;oul, that grandeur of idea, that &s;trength of imagination, which &s;o rarely meet in one mind, mu&s;t naturally de&s;ire to appro|priate &s;uch rare and admirable qualities accord|ing to their own meritorious bent, for it may be &s;et down as an invariable maxim that perfection loves to attach it&s;elf to perfection, and that emi|nent abilities are naturally allied to goodne&s;s of heart.</P>

<P>This is the le&s;s difficult to be accounted for, be|cau&s;e tho&s;e who were of any religion under CHAR|LES the &s;econd inclined to popery, for he him&s;elf died a Roman Catholic; &s;o that this ea&s;y tran&s;ition was no more than to acknowledge publicly, what before had been admitted privately.

JAMES, though he did not under&s;tand poetry, un|der&s;tood that DRYDEN &s;erved him very well as a good advocate, and thus time rolled on, the laureat flattering, and the monarch encouraging; till, having celebrated the birth of a new prince, and written a poem full of predictions, which &s;hew he was more a poet than a prophet, the nation waked from its de|lu&s;ion, and all the golden dreams of our projector vani&s;hed into air.</P>

<P>The <HI>Rival Ladies,</HI> 1664. This is a tragi-comedy;
<PB N="156" REF="156">
it is written in ver&s;e, and cunningly enough dedicated to Lord ORRERY who was a lover and a writer of poetry, and particularly of tragedies in rhime. There were many rea&s;ons why DRYDEN cho&s;e to write in ver&s;e. It was his be&s;t forte, it was a novelty, though in his preface he endeavours to prove that <HI>Gorbuduc</HI> was written in the &s;ame manner, which a&s;&s;ertion LANGBAINE has completely re&s;uted; but the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on, which indeed expo&s;es DRY|DEN to the accu&s;ation of being &s;ub&s;ervient, was that the ear of CHARLES had been accu&s;tomed to the jingle of French rhime. The &s;ucce&s;s of the piece did not warrant the experiment. It was thought novel, but it was con&s;idered as an innova|tion.</P>
<P>Before DRYDEN entered on a third play, he &s;hielded him&s;elf under an alliance with Sir ROBERT HOWARD, who&s;e works we have cur&s;orily ex|amined. They produced between them the <HI>Indian Queen,</HI> in 1665. It met with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, but DRYDEN's enemies gave all the merit to HOWARD, which was invidious enough, for we are ignorant at this moment what part of it he wrote. Perhaps from this grew the coolne&s;s and afterwards the quarrel between the&s;e two authors.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="157">The <HI>Indian Emperor</HI> followed the <HI>Indian Queen</HI> in every &s;en&s;e, for it was a &s;equel to it; a &s;pecies of dramatic entertainment that never did nor ever will &s;ucceed greatly.

<P><HI>Secret Love,</HI> or The <HI>Maiden Queen,</HI> was performed in 1668, by which time DRYDEN was made poet laureat.

<P><HI>Sir Martin Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">all,</HI> 1668, is a mixture from a variety of things; many pa&s;&s;ages are taken from QUINAULT's <HI>L'Amant Indi&s;cret,</HI> and <HI>L'Etourdi</HI> of MOLIERE: <HI>Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ion</HI> has al&s;o been looked into, and the &s;ong belongs to VOITURE; but the heavie&s;t charge made again&s;t DRYDEN was that it was a play given to him by the Duke of NEWCASTLE, which he wrote when he was in France, and this is con|firmed by the books of the Stationers' Company, in which there is a play entered in that nobleman's name, under the &s;ame title.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tempe&s;t,</HI> 1670, is an alteration, and intended as an amendment of SHAKESPEAR's celebrated play under that title. There are &s;ome very artful and ingenious things in this piece, and indeed DRYDEN could not have taxed his genius higher than by venturing to lay any thing of his own by the &s;ide of our incomparable bard. MIRANDA's &s;i&s;ter, who like her had never &s;een a man, and the youth who had never &s;een a woman, make up but the &s;ame in|cident differently treated, therefore it is not any

thing created, but an exten&s;ion of the &s;ame &s;ur|prize, which SHAKESPEAR had before drawn as tight as it would bear, and even the &s;he-mon&s;ter had been anticipated by her brother; all which are clear proofs that the great and natural requi&s;ites for the &s;tage were not completely known to DRYDEN, but this he did not care for; &s;hew and &s;pectacle had become the fa&s;hion, and where could &s;uch a vehicle be found to a&s;&s;i&s;t it as SHAKESPEAR's <HI>Tempe&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>DAVENANT, who it is &s;aid had a hand in this piece, was now dead. The ta&s;te he had introduced his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were obliged to keep up; and DRY|DEN, who has frequently but fal&s;ely confe&s;&s;ed he had no talent for the &s;tage, gave, however wi&s;ely or not, into this ta&s;te, and in his preface he defends his having pillaged SHAKESPEAR, by the lame ex|cu&s;e by the bye, that FLETCHER and Sir JOHN SUCKLING had done &s;o before him. The genius of our immortal poet proved however to be equal to this or any ordeal, for po&s;terity, that infallible critic, while this production with all its tin&s;el attractions is neglected and forgotten, has in its judgement thought proper to re&s;tore SHAKESPEAR to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Whether or not it was con&s;idered that DRYDEN upon a compari&s;on with SHAKESPEAR had fallen
<PB N="160" REF="160">
into di&s;repute, this appeared to be the favourable mo|ment for his enemies to exult. The famous ELKI|NAH SETTLE, whom DRYDEN in his folly handed down or rather kicked into the notice of po&s;terity, in&s;tantly brought out a tragedy in rhime, called The <HI>Empre&s;s of Morocco,</HI> which by means of hired ap|plau&s;e, exactly the farce which was acted over again in France between RACINE and PRADON, grew into &s;uch favour that it was performed by the court ladies at Whitehall.</P>
<P>SETTLE, finding that this fir&s;t blow told &s;o well, publi&s;hed his play with engravings and a bold pre|face, in which he bid his adver&s;ary defiance. DRY|DEN, who all his life &s;eems to have known every thing better than prudence, grew exa&s;perated, and poured out &s;uch a torrent of thoughtle&s;s &s;trictures again&s;t SETTLE and his play, as in&s;tantly made the matter per&s;onal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is hardly to be credited that a man of DRYDEN's con&s;equence and abilities could conde&s;cend to write in this manner. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He is,"</Q> &s;ays he, &s;peaking of SETTLE,

He next goes into an examination of the play, in which there is non&s;en&s;e enough God knows, but it was pitiful that DRYDEN &s;hould have no other employ than to detect it.

This brought LANGBAINE upon RAVENCROFT, who pre&s;ently &s;hewed that DRYDEN had pillaged no le&s;s than eight authors for tho&s;e materials which he worked into The <HI>A&s;&s;ignation.</HI> This play is dedi|cated to &s;ir CHARLES SEDLEY, in a &s;tyle of great elegance, which is, however, le&s;&s;ened in its value by his u&s;ual want of firmne&s;s in deploring his hard treat|ment from the public.</P>
<P><HI>Amboyna,</HI> 1673, as its title evidently &s;hews, was written to &s;erve a popular purpo&s;e by paint|ing a picture of the cruelty of the Dutch to en|flame the minds of the people again&s;t that nation.

It is like mo&s;t temporary things, weak, although he declares in his epilogue he hopes to make his poetry as de&s;tructive as that by which TYRTAEUS of old animated the Spartans.</P>
<P><HI>State of Innocence and Fall of Man.</HI> This piece of cour&s;e was never performed. It is exactly a morality, and, with MILTON before him, it was im|po&s;&s;ible but DRYDEN mu&s;t produce &s;omething full of beauty; but it was written ha&s;tily and thought|le&s;sly, and has &s;uch reprehen&s;ible pa&s;&s;ages in it that its author thought fit to apologize for the liberties he had taken with poetic rules. His dedication of this production to the Duche&s;s of YORK, ought to have in&s;pired her with an ineffable contempt of the author. Dr. JOHNSON calls it
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an attempt to mingle earth and heaven by prai&s;ing human ex|cellence in the language of religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following extract from the dedication will fairly bear the doctor out. LANGBAINE calls it a note beyond <HI>Ela.</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your per&s;on is &s;o admirable that it can &s;carce receive addition when it &s;hall be glorified: and your &s;oul which &s;hines through it, finds it of a &s;ub&s;tance &s;o near her own, that &s;he will be plea&s;ed to pa&s;s an age within it and to be confined to &s;uch a palace."</Q>
It is curious enough that DRYDEN &s;hould make a kind of apology for printing this work. Why &s;hould it not be printed as well as the <HI>Hind and the Panther,</HI> or any other of his writings? But a fal&s;e delicacy or &s;ome other motive prevailed, and fallacy mu&s;t be called in to excu&s;e vanity. He &s;ays that many hundred copies were di&s;per&s;ed abroad without his know|ledge or con&s;ent, and that the&s;e, gathering new faith, it became at length a libel again&s;t him, and, therefore, he was obliged to publi&s;h it in his own defence. Who would have taken the pains to copy a work of &s;uch length much le&s;s to multiply copies to the tune of many hundreds? What a di&s;grace to genius are the&s;e weakne&s;&s;es. Thus, to &s;hew that he was an adept in all the di&s;tinctions of fiction, he pra|tically defines gro&s;s hyperbole to be the &s;tyle of a dedication, and &s;ubtle duplicity the language of a preface.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="169"><HI>Aurenzebe,</HI> 1676. This tragedy is written in rhyme, and appears to have had great pains taken with it; parts of it are de&s;ervedly celebrated, but whatever are its beauties, its being conveyed through this vehicle is an unfurmountable objection to its keeping a place on the theatre, where other|wi&s;e it might perhaps have been de&s;ervedly a fa|vourite.</P>
<P><HI>All for Love,</HI> 1678. This is the only play, if we may believe the author, that he wrote for him&s;elf. It is a pity, however, his favorite play is not ori|ginal, for all the beauty is derived at lea&s;t from SHAKESPEAR, and this circum&s;tance has obliged the world to acknowledge that it is very nearly a complete tragedy. To &s;hew, however, with what caution genius ought to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and curtailed, in furbi&s;hing up this play from SHAKESPEAR, the poli&s;h has di&s;placed many of the beauties, and
<PB N="170" REF="170">
whatever it has gained in harmony and regularity it has lo&s;t in fire and nature. DRYDEN in this tragedy has profe&s;&s;ed to have imitated SHAKESPEAR, but he has done more, he has actually quoted him, not only out of this play but out of others; but every body knows the di&s;tinction; the merit of both are admirable, yet one truth is invincible. DRYDEN could never have &s;hewn &s;o much &s;kill as a lapidary if SHAKESPEAR had not furni&s;hed the diamond.</P>
<P><HI>Oedipus,</HI> 1679. Of this tragedy DRYDEN plan|ned the whole, but only wrote the fir&s;t and third acts; the re&s;t was written by LEE. The &s;ubject has been often treated, but never before &s;o ably. There are, however, &s;ome &s;hocking and di&s;gu&s;ting circum&s;tances in it, and at be&s;t it mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered as a great rather than a plea&s;ing tragedy. The mind naturally prepares it&s;elf for affecting and even terrible circum&s;tances, but without &s;omething to intere&s;t the milder feelings, that terror becomes offen&s;ive and revolting, which by being &s;oftened into pity would have been awful and exemplary.</P>
<P><HI>Troilus and Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> 1679. This play which is confe&s;&s;edly an alteration from SHAKESPEAR, is ne|verthele&s;s in many re&s;pects an improvement. The &s;ubject however is indecent and unbecoming, and
<PB N="171" REF="171">
therefore can never command a re&s;pectable &s;tand on the &s;tage, though it might have plea&s;ed in the licen|tious age in which DRYDEN brought it forward. Every reader of ta&s;te and di&s;cernment rejoices that SHAKESPEAR wrote this play, becau&s;e the charac|ters of the Grecian chiefs are drawn &s;o as to be put upon a fair competition even with tho&s;e of HOMER; but the drift of the play, let it be retouched how it may, will never worthily affect a rational mind.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kind Keeper</HI> has more comic merit than DRYDEN thinks proper to allow him&s;elf, for he &s;ays his genius did not incline him to the &s;tage, and that in particular comedy was not his talent. This play came out in 1680, and was written to expo&s;e, as LANGBAINE &s;ays, the keeping part of the town, but, to be true, this picture was obliged to be &s;o in|decent, that tho&s;e who were ridiculed in it in a ma&s;s, for there does not appear to have been any per|&s;onality, took the advantage of this excu&s;e and fairly damned it, Says an author,
<Q><L>They damned the play all at one fatal blow,</L>
<L>To break the gla&s;s that did their pictures &s;hew.</L></Q></P>
<P>Nay, &s;o far did their aver&s;ion to hear indecency, who were accu&s;tomed to practi&s;e it, prevail, that when DRYDEN publi&s;hed it, he was obliged to ex|punge all the exceptionable pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="172">The <HI>Spani&s;h Friar,</HI> 1681, has one peculiar merit for which its author has been allowed infinite cre|dit; I mean the union of the two plots, which are &s;o well knit and &s;o equally material to the intere&s;t of the piece, that it is difficult to &s;ay which is &s;ub|ordinate. This may be a &s;triking merit in a tragi|comedy, but this very circum&s;tance revolts again&s;t general dramatical or even poetical con&s;truction, which demands not two plots but a plot and an epi&s;ode. DRYDEN, however, &s;ince he cho&s;e to write a play in it&s;elf heterogeneous, cho&s;e al&s;o to give it the &s;ort of &s;trength mo&s;t likely to a&s;&s;i&s;t its intere&s;t.</P>
<P>DRYDEN has been accu&s;ed of attacking the clergy in his play becau&s;e he was refu&s;ed a degree at college, a circum&s;tance however that nobody has been able to &s;ub&s;tantiate. There can be no doubt but the &s;atire is laudable, for it is general. If there be no &s;uch character as <HI>Dominick,</HI> let it be con&s;idered as a mon&s;ter in nature with all my heart; but, as experience has frequently proved that &s;uch agents of infamy have too often de&s;troyed the peace of families, and &s;hrouded their hypocri&s;y under the veil of &s;anctity, nothing can be &s;o meri|torious as &s;uch an expo&s;ition; in which ca&s;e let every one who complains be con&s;idered as an abetter of
<PB N="173" REF="173">
this mo&s;t pernicious of all crimes; but as this play is well known and as de&s;ervedly a favorite as any thing can be, made up of incongruous materials, this te&s;t will &s;ufficiently &s;hew that the drift was me|ritorious.</P>
<P>The <HI>Duke of Gui&s;e,</HI> 1683, written by DRYDEN in conjunction with LEE, was con&s;idered as a piece levelled at the enemies of the court, for which DRYDEN was &s;everely attacked; but he parried the thru&s;t by throwing all the odium on LEE; for, &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"availing him&s;elf of a promi&s;e I had made to write a play with him, he happened to claim it ju&s;t upon the fini&s;hing of a poem, when I would have been glad of a little re&s;pite."</Q>
Thus he not only loads LEE with all the reproach due to what that author had written, but he tacitly blames him for hurrying him into what he had written him&s;elf, which was, as he tells us, at lea&s;t two thirds of the play.</P>
<P><HI>Albion and Albianus,</HI> 1685, a ma&s;que, was the only dramatic piece written by DRYDEN during the reign of JAMES the &s;econd. It was like every thing el&s;e of this author at that time, produced on purpo&s;e to annoy the republicans; and was particu|larly aimed at the fanciful doctrines of Lord SHAFTS|BURY
<PB N="574" REF="174">
and his adherents. This ma&s;que was got up at a very great expence, but excited &s;o little cu|rio&s;ity that it would have been very unprofitable to the theatre had it taken any run; but, to &s;ettle the matter at once, on the &s;econd night of its repre|&s;entation, an alarm being given that the duke of MONMOUTH had landed in the we&s;t, the various intere&s;ts excited for the fate of that gallant but un|advi&s;ed nobleman ab&s;orbed every other con&s;idera|tion, and <HI>Albion and Albianus</HI> was never re&s;umed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor JOHNSON places this event at the performance of <HI>King Arthur,</HI> which did not make its appearance, as we &s;hall &s;ee, till after the Revolution, and, &s;ix years after the Duke of MONMOUTH was beheaded.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We have now gone over all the dramatic works of DRYDEN before the revolution. I &s;hall next examine tho&s;e of his cotemporaries up to that pe|riod, taking in &s;uch popular circum&s;tances as &s;erved to make them remarkable.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP IX. WYCHERLY, SHADWELL, SEDLEY, LEE, SETTLE, DURFEY, AND CROWNE.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL have next to &s;peak of WYCHERLY; but I &s;hall not examine the particulars of his becoming a Roman Catholic in FRANCE, his turning Prote&s;tant on his arrival in ENGLAND, his being a favourite of VILLIERS, Duke of Buckingham, and of CHARLES the &s;econd, who paid him a vi&s;it in his lodging in Bow Street, where he was &s;ick, and advi&s;ed him to go to the South of FRANCE, allowing him five hundred pounds to defray his expences, the king's chu&s;ing him governor to his &s;on, probably the Duke of MON|MOUTH, and allowing him fifteen hundred a year as a pen&s;ion for undertaking that trouble; his lo&s;ing all this favour and protection by marrying the Counte&s;s of DROGHEDA; his re&s;entment of the king's coolne&s;s; his lady's jealou&s;y, the violence of which &s;o conquered her health that &s;he left him a widower; his di&s;putes concerning her fortune by the
<PB N="176" REF="176">
means of which he was thrown into pri&s;on, and afterwards relea&s;ed by JAMES the &s;econd, who, hav|ing &s;een the <HI>Plain Dealer,</HI> paid his debts and gave him two hundred a year, in &s;pite of all which, how|ever, he was always in di&s;tre&s;s; of the&s;e and many other particulars, which make up the curious and varied hi&s;tory of WYCHERLY, I mu&s;t content my|&s;elf with this &s;ummary account and pa&s;s on to his plays.</P>
<P>The&s;e are <HI>Love in a Wood,</HI> performed in 1672, which is &s;o poor a &s;pecimen of that wit afterwards &s;o con&s;picious in WYCHERLY, that it can &s;carcely have been &s;uppo&s;ed the production of that author. The <HI>Gentleman Dancing Ma&s;ter,</HI> 1673, has a flight claim to prai&s;e. The <HI>Country Wife,</HI> &s;o frequently altered, and now well known on the &s;tage, is, how|ever, a play of a different de&s;cription. The cha|racters are well drawn, and convey a &s;trong portion of wit and gaiety, and at the &s;ame time di&s;play a great deal of nature and truth. The <HI>Plain Dealer,</HI> however, is the be&s;t of WYCHERLY's produc|tions by a con&s;iderable difference. It was DRY|DEN's opinion that this piece contained a &s;pe|cies of the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;atire that the Engli&s;h &s;tage had ever boa&s;ted. It is certainly full of correct nature, &s;trong, point, and &s;hrewd ob&s;erva|tion;
<PB N="177" REF="177">
but its plot is, perhaps, one of the happie&s;t that ever was invented. An amiable man, who has e&s;tranged his heart from a friend and a mi&s;tre&s;s who love and value him, for a man and a woman who deceive and betray him, who is &s;o infatuated with his ab&s;urd partiality that he is made to be un|ju&s;t and ungenerous, with an honourable and noble heart, and who at length corrects his folly, and &s;e|cures to him&s;elf happine&s;s for life by the detection of his fal&s;e friends, and a conviction of their truth who had been faithful to him, is a mo&s;t admirable ground work indeed. Nor is the ju&s;tice thrown into the epi&s;ode le&s;s dramatic, or le&s;s meritorious, and what keeps it in place is, that, though it is intere&s;ting and u&s;eful in the piece, it is &s;till epi&s;ode. The mi&s;|anthrope and other things &s;eem to have been in WYCHERLY's mind when he traced his characters; but when &s;ubjects are &s;o well handled it is but mean cavilling to &s;ay much about it; and, in revenge, if he had recour&s;e to French writers, Engli&s;h writers have had recour&s;e to him, and to &s;uch effect as to make the world believe tho&s;e pictures original which they have only traced upon his canvas.</P>
<P>SHADWELL, who&s;e father lo&s;t a competent for|tune by his adherence to CHARLES the fir&s;t, having
<PB N="178" REF="178">
been well educated, was thrown upon the world, like many others at the Re&s;toration, and obliged to live by his wits and wrote &s;everal plays which were well received.</P>
<P>In this reign of plots and parties, as it was im|po&s;&s;ible to be con&s;idered as a public character with|out e&s;pou&s;ing &s;ome particular cau&s;e or opinion, &s;o out of this came opportunity for all that &s;everity which DRYDEN &s;o profu&s;ely dealt on the head of SHADWELL; who, being a profe&s;&s;ed Whig, and his antagoni&s;t a profe&s;&s;ed Tory, furni&s;hed him&s;elf the materials by which his public character might be attacked, which, probably DRYDEN would not have u&s;ed had not his &s;ucce&s;s as a dramatic writer, though clearly an inferior one, rou&s;ed that irritability in his nature, which upon &s;uch occa&s;ions he could not re&s;train. This, however, manife&s;ted it&s;elf only by indirect indications till the appearance of The <HI>Duke of Gui&s;e,</HI> when, it being plainly proved that SHADWELL had a hand in the pamphlet that was written again&s;t it, DRYDEN vindicated him&s;elf and a &s;torm was rai&s;ed that SHADWELL with great diffi|culty weathered, and which obliged one HUNT, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted, to take &s;helter in HOLLAND.</P>
<P>DRYDEN, having now a proper opportunity,
<PB N="179" REF="179">
determined to cru&s;h SHADWELL at once; to do which he wrote his celebrated poem of <HI>Mac Flecknoe</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s over here a very extraordinary error that every writer that I can find, except LANGBAINE, has run into, as to the time of DRYDEN's writing this poem, and his motive for it. Over and over again are we told that it aro&s;e entirely from the mor|tification he felt when SHADWELL &s;ucceeded him as laureat, through the intere&s;t of lord DORSET, who has been &s;aid by the way which is not very likely having been the patron of SHADWELL, to have re|munerated DRYDEN out of his own pur&s;e. As to Dr. JOHNSON, I do not &s;ee how he ever could have read the poem, for he &s;ays that DRYDEN
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"celebrated the intruder's inauguration in a poem, ex|qui&s;itely &s;atirical, called <HI>Mac Flecknoe.</HI>"</Q>
There is nothing in the poem that induces you to under&s;tand this, but you are obliged to believe the very rever&s;e. Fir&s;t of all, was FLENCNOE ever laureat? and, if he was not, how could he re&s;ign the laurel to his &s;on SHAD|WELL? At the time when this di&s;pute was at its height, for he had left off writing for the &s;tage nineteen years, FLECKNOE was on the verge of the grave, and it is very probable that he did not live till the revolution, a point, however, I cannot determine, for no one of his biographers have mentioned the time of his birth, or his death. The po&s;ition of the argument in the poem is that FLECKNOE had long reigned <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"through all the realms of non&s;en&s;e ab&s;olute;"</Q> and, being <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"worn out with bu&s;ine&s;s,"</Q> which he mu&s;t have been, having left off nineteen years,
<Q><L>" did at length debate</L>
<L>" To &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;tate."</L></Q></P>
<P>What &s;tate? The Realms of Non&s;en&s;e. What has this to do with the King's poet laureat? Surely nothing; for, if it had, DRYDEN mu&s;t have been the MAC FLECKNOE of his own poem. This Em|peror of Non&s;en&s;e, like ALEXANDER, nominates for a &s;ucce&s;&s;or the mo&s;t worthy, for &s;ays he
<Q><L>Nature pleads, that he</L>
<L>Should only rule who mo&s;t re&s;embles me.</L>
<L>SHADWELL alone my perfect image bears,</L>
<L>Mature in dullne&s;s from his tender years;</L>
<L>SHADWELL alone, of all my &s;ons, is he</L>
<L>Who &s;tands confirmed in full &s;tupidity:</L>
<L>The re&s;t to &s;ome faint meaning make pretence,</L>
<L>But SHADWELL never deviates into &s;en&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>He next enumerates the collateral preten&s;ions of SHADWELL; hints at <HI>Ep&s;om Wells,</HI> the <HI>Virtuo&s;o,</HI> and other things in which he &s;tole from ETHERIDGE, or was helped out by SEDLEY; but no mention is made of any thing &s;o late as the duke of GUISE, and, having con|ducted him to the palace of Dulne&s;s, &s;ituate on the ruins of ALLEYN's Theatre, then become a brothel, he inve&s;ts him with the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;ignia and di&s;appears through a trap. What re&s;emblance even in the remote&s;t degree has this to the inauguration of a poet laureat? but, to clench this nail, which perhaps is fa&s;t enough already, LANG|BAINE, one rea&s;on of who&s;e enmity to DRYDEN was his firm friend|&s;hip for SHADWELL, and who mu&s;t have known, becau&s;e he knew both the men, when and why this poem was written, has in his life of SHADWELL, the&s;e words:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. DRYDEN I dare pre&s;ume little imagined, when he wrote that &s;atire of <HI>Mac Flecknoe,</HI> that the &s;ub|ject he there &s;o much expo&s;es and ridicules &s;hould have ever lived to have &s;ucceeded him in wearing the bays."</Q>
Now, as LANG|BAINE is Dr JOHNSON's oracle as to every thing dramatic, it is really unlucky he did not happen to light upon this pa&s;&s;age.</P></NOTE>, which POPE confe&s;&s;es to have been the
<PB N="180" REF="180">
ground work of The <HI>Dunciad,</HI> to which I &s;hall add that, though for the cau&s;e of poetry it is well that the&s;e poems were written, for the cau&s;e of candour,
<PB N="181" REF="181">
and out of re&s;pect to the reputations of their au|thors as men, it had been better they had never been written at all. General invective is ea&s;ily vented and poetry is di&s;graced and contaminated when it de&s;cends to &s;curility and per&s;onality.</P>
<P>SHADWELL, like BROME, made JONSON his model, and there can be no doubt but many of his plays have con&s;iderable merit. The <HI>Sullen Lovers,</HI> 1668. This piece is regular and natural. It however wants &s;pirit and is little more than an imitation of <HI>Les Facheux</HI> of MOLIERE. The <HI>Royal Shepherde&s;s,</HI> though always given to SHADWELL, was, as I have already noticed, written by a Mr. FOUNTAIN, and only fitted to the &s;tage by him, as he candidly confe&s;&s;es in an epi&s;tle prefixed to the publication. The <HI>Humouri&s;ts,</HI> 1671, was intended to ridicule the follies of the age, and the reader may di&s;cern a clo&s;e imitation of JON|SON throughout the piece. It &s;hared the fate of DRYDEN's <HI>Kind Keeper,</HI> being damned by tho&s;e who mo&s;t &s;everely felt the force of its ridicule. The <HI>Mi&s;er,</HI> 1672, is both from PLAUTUS and MOLIERE. SHADWELL has made a very good play of it, but it remained for FIELDING to give it perfection.</P>
<P><HI>Ep&s;om Wells,</HI> 1676, is certainly a play of great merit. The author had JONSON's <HI>Bartholomew Fair</HI> in view, to which comedy it has been pre|ferred,
<PB N="182" REF="182">
but it cannot, however, be &s;aid to have been &s;tolen from it. It has been highly &s;poken of, and perpetually pilfered; but &s;uch was the &s;orene&s;s of tho&s;e times, that the hits were thought too hard, and therefore tho&s;e who felt them rai&s;ed a &s;ucce&s;sful oppo&s;ition to it. <HI>P&s;yche,</HI> 1675. This was a tra|gedy full of machinery and written in rhime. In|deed the very piece which was parodied by DUFFET. The <HI>Libertine,</HI> 1676. This tragedy is upon the &s;ame &s;ubject that has employed &s;o many Spani&s;h, Italian, and French pens, and which the more na|turally it is written the more horror it will beget. SHADWELL has done his be&s;t, and to &s;ay truth, tho&s;e who love terror, without probability or intere&s;t, may here &s;atiate them&s;elves. The <HI>Virtuo&s;o,</HI> 1676 is a comedy profe&s;&s;edly in imitation of JONSON. It is full of characters, &s;trongly drawn, and inci|dents well imagined, &s;ome of which have been fre|frequently borrowed &s;ince and brought out as novelties.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hi&s;tory of Timon of Athens,</HI> 1678, This is SHAKESPEAR's play altered, but by no means for the better. The <HI>True Widow,</HI> 1679. This is again a comedy full of general &s;atire, &s;trong character, and whim&s;ical incidents, and has been a good deal &s;tudied by &s;ome of our modern playwrights. Its fate was like others of this de&s;cription; it hit
<PB N="183" REF="183">
too hard to be liked. The <HI>Woman Captain,</HI> 1680, is a comedy of the &s;ame de&s;cription; it had better &s;ucce&s;s. The <HI>Lanca&s;hire Witches,</HI> 1682. This was a party play, and therefore was &s;everely attacked. Whether DRYDEN was concerned in its oppo&s;ition cannot now be known, for he does not appear to have done any thing overtly, but we are told from this time the mutual enmity of the&s;e authors was firmly rooted, and that it broke out in the following year we certainly know; after which time SHADWELL wrote nothing for the &s;tage till the Revolution. I &s;hall, therefore leave him for the pre&s;ent to &s;peak of others his cotemporaries.</P>
<P>Sir CHARLES SEDLEY, one of the mo&s;t brilliant wits in the reign of CHARLES the &s;econd, and who in point of elegance emulated ETHERIDGE, and the more refined &s;et who in the mid&s;t of their pro|fligacy, unlike the king, ROCHESTER, and others, had &s;ome delicacy in their plea&s;ures, and were now and then &s;urprized with a gleam of &s;omething al|mo&s;t like honour and hone&s;ty, comes before us, not as he did before the court at We&s;tmin&s;ter, when he was fined five hundred pounds for a riot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This happened near the death of CHARLES the &s;econd; and SEDLEY was &s;o &s;hocked at the ab&s;urdity of his conduct, which had drawn on him &s;o much odium, that he became from that moment an altered man. He applied him&s;elf to bu&s;ine&s;s, got into parliament, was a celebrated &s;peaker, and &s;ignalized him&s;elf again&s;t the in|tere&s;t of JAMES the &s;econd, by re&s;i&s;ting vehemently the propo&s;ition for a &s;tanding army after the defeat of the duke of MONMOUTH.

It is writ|ten partly in pro&s;e, partly in rhime, and partly in blank ver&s;e. <HI>Sophontfba,</HI> 1676. DRYDEN had made rhime &s;o fa&s;hionable that LEE as well as others followed his example. <HI>Sophoni&s;ha</HI> is wholly in metre. There is a wonderful tenderne&s;s in this play, and it had great &s;ucce&s;s; but, from the mo|ment DRYDEN rejected rhime, and di&s;covered that even blank ver&s;e was &s;peaking more like men of this world, both his and all other tragedies upon this plan were abandoned.</P>
<P><HI>Gloriana,</HI> 1676. This piece is full of frenzy, mixed now and then with great beauty. It had no &s;ucce&s;s. The <HI>Rival Queens,</HI> 1677. This tragedy is &s;o well known that its mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages are every where repeated by heart. It has been a good deal cen&s;ured, unmeritedly, however; unle&s;s on account of &s;ome &s;peeches which are full of bom|ba&s;t, for its characters and its con&s;truction are ma&s;ter pieces. <HI>Alexander,</HI> every where a mixture

<P>As for &s;ituation, the entry of <HI>Alexander,</HI> his banquet, and his death, being di&s;po&s;ed in the fir&s;t, third, and fifth acts, proves LEE not only a good writer, but al&s;o an adept in the formation of dra|matic production.

<P><HI>Mithridates,</HI> 1678. This tragedy contains many flights of fancy, but it is by no means equal to other things of this author. DRYDEN wrote the epilogue, which is proportionably unequal. <HI>Theo|do&s;ius,</HI> 1680, is a tragedy of &s;ufficient merit to &s;tamp the reputation of a writer. It is and ever has been in high favour on the &s;tage; &s;uch favour as beauti|ful and exqui&s;ite language, noble and dignified character, and tender and melting di&s;tre&s;s demand. The epi&s;ode, however, of <HI>Marican and Pulcheria</HI> is poor and unworthy to make a part of &s;uch a play. <HI>Cae&s;ar Borgia,</HI> 1680, is compo&s;ed of that mixture of bomba&s;t and beauty which appear in all LEE's productions when the frantic fit was on.

however, &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s for a time, but has been long thrown a&s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Lucuis Junius Brutus,</HI> 1681. This tragedy is written with great beauty, &s;trength, and dignity. It is remarkably free from that bomba&s;t which per|vades this author, for there is a manline&s;s and a noble grandeur runs through the whole of it. It was &s;topt after the third night, as we are informed, by lord ARLINGTON, who was then chamberlain, as an anti monarchical play. <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great,</HI> 1684. This &s;ubject, which has been treated by many authors, was not &s;o fortunately handled by LEE as the la&s;t. The play, however, though it has inequalities, is not without merit, but it has not enough to entitle it to permanent &s;ucce&s;s. The&s;e are all the plays of LEE before the revolution; he was, however, as we have &s;een, concerned in <HI>Oedipus,</HI> and the <HI>Duke of Gui&s;e,</HI> with DRYDEN.</P>

<P>In the <HI>Siege of Memphis,</HI> 1676, DURFEY was determined to be original as to plot, and an imitator as to &s;tyle, both of which circum&s;tances were unfortunate; for, as he could neither invent nor write ver&s;e, his &s;tory is unintere&s;ting, and his writing &s;u&s;tian, and the audience gave him to under&s;tand that they were of this opinion. The <HI>Fond Hu&s;band,</HI> 1676, is a much better play, and was well received. It is a comedy, and in it there is nothing attempted beyond the &s;ketch of the author's abilities.

The public therefore did not thank Mr. DURFEY for producing what nobody could under&s;tand. The <HI>Virtuous Wife,</HI> a comedy, 1680. Here, not conten|with &s;tealing from others, he has gone back and gleaned from MARSTON's <HI>Fawn,</HI> where he had reaped a pretty harve&s;t before; and to make all &s;ure, he traver&s;ed DRYDEN's <HI>Marriage Ala Mode,</HI> and a few other things that lay in the way. <HI>Sir Barnaby Whig,</HI> 1681.

<P><HI>The Country Wit,</HI> 1675.

<P>BANKS, a very indifferent yet rather a favourite writer, produced five tragedies which demand an examination in this place.

In &s;hort it is impo&s;&s;ible not to take the lady's part; for as &s;he had then pro|duced thirteen plays, and all as good as this, it was rather a &s;ort of prudery and &s;queami&s;hne&s;s in the town to begin their objections here.

<HEAD>CHAP. I. STATE OF THE STAGE AT THE REVOLUTION AND ONWARDS TO 1708.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een that, at the Re&s;toration, the &s;tage become a regular e&s;tabli&s;hment under two patents, that one company by calling in auxiliary a&s;&s;i&s;tance conquered the other, and that, after much conten|tion and a &s;truggle between a variety of intere&s;ts, all dramatic di&s;putes were amicably adju&s;ted by a union of the two companies in 1684; at which time they in one body performed in Drury Lane, and were called the King's Company.</P>
<P>In their expectations, however, of the probable
<PB N="208" REF="209">
advantages that might ari&s;e from this coalition of intere&s;ts, they were mi&s;erably deceived. Scarcely had they &s;at down under the comfortable idea that every man would con&s;ider his neighbour's good and do his utmo&s;t to &s;erve and a&s;&s;i&s;t the general concern, than the whole community began to be convul&s;ed with different di&s;&s;entions. The united patentees impo&s;ed what terms they thought proper on the actors; for the profits of the theatre were divided into twenty &s;hares, ten of which went to the pro|prietors, who were ten in number, and the other moiety to the actors, in &s;uch &s;ubdivi&s;ions as their different merits entitled them to.</P>
<P>Here then are ten managers, or, as CIBBER calls them, ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, &s;ome of them not in the remote&s;t degree conver&s;ant with affairs of the theatre; but, as if this was not enough to create di&s;&s;entions, &s;uch of the&s;e proprietors as were in needy circum&s;tances &s;old their &s;hares to money-lenders, or other &s;pecu|lators, who though &s;till more ignorant of theatrical bu&s;ine&s;s had neverthele&s;s a proportionate voice in the management of the concern. This was the &s;ituation of the theatre in 1690.</P>
<P>In proportion as ignorance u&s;urped authority, &s;o the actors, who ought of cour&s;e to be con&s;idered as
<PB N="209" REF="210">
the real &s;upporters of the theatre, began with rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied. The major part of this decemviri, wanting to cut up the hen for her golden eggs, thought they &s;hould carry all the world before them by laying on foreign ta&s;te and foreign decorations as thick as po&s;&s;ible, which by the way at length pro|duced the opera, &s;ince when without a &s;ingle devia|tion the ma&s;s of the nobility have looked down with contempt on the theatre.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of all this they pre&s;ently got into a &s;uit in Chancery, which la&s;ted twenty years. Had their mea&s;ures been dictated by common &s;en&s;e, &s;till every thing might have come about, but unhappily their conduct was not tinctured with that ingredient. The expence for &s;pectacle was re|doubled, foreigners were cheri&s;hed at any price, and not only the &s;hare of the profits decreed to be divided between the actors was con&s;iderably re|duced, but the actors them&s;elves were badly dre&s;&s;ed and in every other re&s;pect neglected and held in contempt.</P>
<P>In the mean time their profits fell off every day; and, as in con&s;equence it was found nece&s;&s;ary to le&s;&s;en the expence, in&s;tead of directing their at|tention

to the real grievance, they lowered &s;till more the emoluments of the actors; and, in order to manage as much to their own confu&s;ion as po&s;|&s;ible, under a colour of ju&s;tice they began with the principal performers, and upon their murmuring, to go from bad to wor&s;e, brought forward young actors and actre&s;&s;es in the characters u&s;ually played by the veterans. The natural con&s;equence of all this is evident. BETTERTON, a theatrical WAR|WICK, who had made and depo&s;ed kings at plea|&s;ure, began to look about him; and, getting into his plot the principal performers, they agreed to op|po&s;e their oppre&s;&s;ors and &s;tand or fall together.</P>
<P>All this, however, the patentees, &s;ecure in their power and covered with their foreign levies, treated with perfect indifference; but when they found that, by the intere&s;t of BETTERTON, the complaints of the actors were, through lord DORSET, lain be|fore king WILLIAM, they began &s;eriou&s;ly to re|flect on their &s;ituation. They were not, however, ea&s;ily repul&s;ed, and &s;ome of them knowing the world pretty well, and particularly RICH, who was a lawyer, &s;ugge&s;ted that by the law as it then &s;tood no other patent could be granted. This, however, was looking a little farther than they could leap, for it was very nearly con&s;idered as an in&s;ult to the crown, and
<PB N="211" REF="214">
therefore the aggrieved parties had liberty to con|&s;ult the able&s;t lawyers on the &s;ubject, who reported that the grants of CHARLES the &s;econd did not pre|clude the right of any &s;ucceeding prince to grant a patent to any per&s;on with whom he might think pro|per to entru&s;t it.</P>
<P>This deci&s;ion was &s;everely felt by the patentees, who, too late, &s;incerely wi&s;hed for a reconciliation; which, had not the players been &s;trengthened with the acquie&s;cence of all &s;en&s;ible men that their cau&s;e was the cau&s;e of truth and honour, and therefore ought to be encouraged, could not now have been complied with, on account of their having gone &s;o far and intere&s;ted even government in their quarrel.</P>
<P>In this cri&s;is queen MARY died; and, during the interval that the theatre was nece&s;&s;arily &s;hut up, BETTERTON and his adherents had lei&s;ure to pur&s;ue their plan of operations. In the mean time the oppo&s;ite party were trying their utmo&s;t to gain over volunteers to their &s;tandard. POWEL and VER|BRUGGEN, who&s;e &s;allaries had been only forty &s;hil|lings each, was now complimented with four pounds, and the re&s;t of the actors and actre&s;&s;es in proportion. BETTERTON, however, lo&s;t nothing by this; for all
<PB N="212" REF="215">
who felt them&s;elves properly aggrieved found his ca&s;e to be their own and were as willing to emancipate from tyranny as he was. Every thing promi&s;ed a favourable i&s;&s;ue. They had an audience of the king who graciou&s;ly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with a&s;&s;urances of his favour and protection, and they were imme|diately empowered by his royal licence to act in a &s;eparate theatre by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Sub&s;criptions in&s;tantly, and mo&s;t &s;piritedly, were &s;et on foot, and it was agreed to erect a theatre within the walls of the Tennis Court in Lincoln's Inn Fields. As this, however, required time, the patentees were determined to u&s;e all their diligence to get the &s;tart of them every way, and, therefore, opened on the following April with <HI>Abdelazar, or the Moors Revenge,</HI> written by Mrs. BEHN, and in|troduced by an occa&s;ional prologue, which was CIBBER's fir&s;t literary attempt. After the fir&s;t night, however, they were completely de&s;erted, and the town, who had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee the be&s;t actors, waited with impatient anxiety for the open|ing of the new theatre.</P>
<P>In about a fortnight their curio&s;ity was gratified; for on the thirteenth of April, 1695, the new theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields opened with CONGREVE's
<PB N="213" REF="216">
celebrated comedy of <HI>Love for Love</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This play had nearly fallen into the hands of the patentees of Drury-lane, for before the rupture between the managers and the actors it had been read and approved; but, while the articles of agreement were preparing, CONGREVE received an intimation of the premediated de&s;ign, and, therefore, pau&s;ed under a determination that the play &s;hould go with the actors for whom he had written the parts.</NOTE>; the &s;ucce&s;s of this play was &s;o great that they &s;carcely found it nece&s;&s;ary to perform any other throughout the whole &s;ea&s;on. CONGREVE now accepted a whole &s;hare to produce a play every year, exclu&s;ive of his profits from this comedy, in the &s;ame manner as DRYDEN did to produce two; &s;ome &s;ay four, but that I &s;hall conte&s;t. His next play, however, The <HI>Mourning Bride,</HI> did not make its appearance till three years afterwards.</P>
<P>Thus Lincoln's-inn fields went on favoured with &s;plendid &s;ucce&s;s, while Drury lane was completely de&s;erted, and indeed upon &s;o natural and fair a prin|ciple that nobody regretted it. In time, however, the novelty of encouraging merit wore off; be&s;ides many of the performers at Lincoln's inn fields grew old and became en&s;eebled, while tho&s;e at the other hou&s;e, being young and vigorous, came forward with &s;ome degree of force. CIBBER by this time
<PB N="214" REF="217">
had made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s both as an author and an actor, and they were reinforced by the plays of SOUTHERN and VANBRUGH, which made their dramatic novelties at lea&s;t five to one in number. In addition to this, BETTERTON's company, confi|dent of their &s;uperior merit, grew negligent with their &s;ucce&s;s, in proportion as the di&s;appointment of their competitors &s;timulated them to indu&s;try.</P>
<P>This brought on a &s;ort of recrimination between this theatre and the public, who were accu&s;ed by the actors of capriciou&s;ne&s;s, while they accu&s;ed the actors in return of &s;upinene&s;s and want of ex|ertion. The con&s;equence was that the cau&s;e of neither hou&s;e was heartily e&s;pou&s;ed, and at length Lincoln's-inn-fields was obliged to follow the ex|ample of Drury-lane, and only pay their people in proportion to the &s;ucce&s;s of the concern. CIBBER tells us that the manager of Drury-lane never paid the people at all when the money did not come in, nor when it did except in &s;uch proportion as &s;uited his own convenience. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I was one of the many,"</Q> &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"who for &s;ix acting weeks together, never received one day's pay; and for &s;ome years after &s;eldom had above one half our nominal &s;alaries."</Q>
No wonder then when the other hou&s;e began to adopt a conduct &s;o &s;hameful, &s;o unju&s;t, and &s;o di&s;|hone&s;t,
<PB N="215" REF="218">
the public &s;hould begin to think their prin|ciples no better than tho&s;e of their neighbours; but now came a &s;troke of cunning, as RICH imagined, that whether or not it might benefit him was &s;ure to injure the intere&s;t of his adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>He had conceived that, as &s;ervants have ge|nerally the ear of their ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, if he could ingratiate him&s;elf with tho&s;e he &s;hould &s;oon fill his boxes, to the de&s;ertion of the other hou&s;e. Footmen had never before this time been admitted into the theatre, except to wait the plea&s;ure of their employers, nor at all till after the four thact of the play. Determined therefore to &s;ecure their intere&s;t, he opened the upper gallery gratis for their reception, and
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if he did this to get ap|plau&s;e,"</Q>
&s;ays CIBBER,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he certainly &s;ucceeded, for it often thundered from the full gallery above, while the thin pit and &s;canty boxes below were in a &s;tate of perfect &s;erenity."</Q>
This &s;hameful cu&s;tom, which continued &s;o long, and was with &s;uch difficulty &s;haken off, was the mo&s;t flagrant di&s;grace the theatre ever &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>But he was not content with this. Conceiving that fa&s;hionable bucks and &s;prigs of quality would come to the theatre with more readine&s;s if they
<PB N="216" REF="219">
could get acce&s;s to the actors and actre&s;&s;es, he ad|mitted &s;uch as would pay behind the &s;cenes; a cu&s;|tom that &s;truck at the very exi&s;tence of all decency and decorum, and indeed went to render the per|formance impracticable. This, however, CIBBER, when he came to be one of the managers, contrived as he tells us, at the hazard of their lives to aboli&s;h; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"after which,"</Q> &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we brought what had before di&s;graced the theatre into all the licences of a lobby, into the decencies of a drawing|room."</Q></P>
<P>This was not all. Buffoonery, tumbling, rope|dancing, and every other di&s;graceful &s;pecies of mum|mery that was afterwards &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed by his &s;on were exhibited through this ignorant and pretended director of the public ta&s;te. It was at this moment that JEREMY COLLIER publi&s;hed a book again&s;t the &s;tage. His &s;trictures go to the immorality of the plays, the profligacy of the performers, and the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the poets; and it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed that, however he may have been too liberal of invective, he has fairly embraced the &s;ide of truth. All the indecency that condemned the plays of ETHERIDGE and others to oblivion, that more than once wrung from DRYDEN contrition and re|pentance that made that filthy and &s;tupid play The
<PB N="217" REF="220">
<HI>London Cuckolds,</HI> a &s;tanding di&s;h with profligates, and, in &s;hort, bad as the times were, that kept ladies from the new plays till they had enquired whether they might attend them without blu&s;hing, were man|fully expo&s;ed to that reprehen&s;ion that no man could dare to &s;ay they did not &s;everely merit</P>
<P>The misfortune in COLLIER was, that, in not qualifying the bu&s;ine&s;s, he di&s;covered the cloven foot. Had he recommended a reform, the advice had been whole&s;ome, and every friend to decorum would have thanked him; but nothing would con|tent him but rooting out the evil by aboli&s;hing the &s;tage it&s;elf; which, by all the world, had been ever acknowledged, if properly conducted, to be as whole&s;ome a vehicle for morality as the pulpit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A gentleman in the company of JOE HAINES, the famous actor, and wit, &s;aid he could not conceive what induced Mr. COLLIER to in&s;i&s;t upon the total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage, when it had only been abu&s;ed by the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of a few of its members. <Q REND="inline">"Why,"</Q> &s;aid HAINES,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the &s;tage was in&s;tituted to mend the morals, and COLLIER, being by profe&s;&s;ion a moral mender, he quarrels with it, upon the principle that two of a trade can never agree."</Q></NOTE>. For this rea&s;on, and for this only, the wits had a fair occa&s;ion to attack him, and DRYDEN, CONGREVE, VANBRUGH, DENNIS, and others levelled at him a
<PB N="218" REF="221">
volley of keen &s;atire. They had, however, a bad cau&s;e to defend, for they could neither refute his general arguments, nor exculpate them&s;elves; nay they injured the cau&s;e they e&s;pou&s;ed, for the pub|lic, ever in the right on the &s;ide of all that's true and honourable, felt fuller conviction from their lame defence, and the controver&s;y fini&s;hed &s;o far in favour of COLLIER that the town re&s;olved inde|cency &s;hould no longer be con&s;idered as wit; and thus, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"by degrees,"</Q> &s;ays CIBBEER,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the fair &s;ex came again to fill the theatre on the fir&s;t day of a new comedy without fear or cen&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P>Thus COLLIER's work did much both for him|&s;elf and the &s;tage, for the general drift of it was con&s;idered &s;o laudable by all per&s;ons, but e&s;pecially by the king, that he granted him a <HI>noli profequi</HI> which relieved him from the penalty of the law in con&s;equence of &s;ome impropriety in his po|litical conduct; &s;ome &s;ay ab&s;olving two traytors before their execution, but this was not all. The &s;tage afterwards was narrowly watched; ob&s;cene ex|pre&s;&s;ions in former plays were obliged to be ex|punged; and nothing new was produced before it underwent the examination of a licencer. In con&s;e|quence of this many were pro&s;ecuted by govern|ment for uttering profane or indecent expre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="219" REF="222">
among whom BETTERTON and Mrs. BRACEGIRDLE were acually fined.</P>
<P>It is to be very much lamented that, when they were prohibiting indecent words, they did not pro|hibit indecent actions, but the contrary was the ca&s;e; for all that the plays lo&s;t with the profligates by be|ing deprived of what they con&s;idered as the <HI>&s;el poignant,</HI> the po&s;turing and tumbling made up for; which gained ground &s;o fa&s;t that at length the com|pany in Lincolns Inn Fields were obliged in their own defence to adopt the &s;ame conduct, and thus they went on, exciting veneration mixed with pity, till VANBRUGH, who had left Drury Lane, &s;ug|ge&s;ted, as a new attraction, the building of a &s;plendid hou&s;e in the Haymarket, for the purpo&s;e of perform|ing as well &s;pectacles as plays.</P>
<P>It has been generally imagined, and indeed fre|quently a&s;&s;erted, that the Italian opera was not at|tempted in ENGLAND till about the year 1700; but this certainly is not the fact. It was imported &s;oon after BETTERTON took his trip to PARIS for &s;cenes, and this is very natural; for the French finding from that circum&s;tance the avidity with which the Engli&s;h &s;wallowed novelty, &s;ent, as we have &s;een, fir&s;t CAM|BERT, and afterwards many others, and I have al|ready
<PB N="220" REF="223">
noticed that PURCEL, in 1685, complains of this innovation which he &s;ays had too long prevailed.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies of amu&s;ement, however, was in no &s;tate of perfectne&s;s, even &s;o early as 1700, nor, in|deed, till here as in France the opera &s;ingers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an exclu&s;ive theatre. The theatre in the Haymarket was built in 1705, and at that time the principal &s;inger, always a eunuch, &s;ung his part in Italian while all the other characters &s;ung and recited their parts in Engli&s;h. VALENTINI was the FARINELLI of that time, and we don't find that the ladies of fa&s;hion then, in ab&s;urd encouragement, or extravagant prai&s;e of what they could neither ta&s;te nor under&s;tand, were a little behind tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>Opera, however, was the word; and, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance from this auxiliary, it would have been con&s;idered as madne&s;s to have opened the new the|atre. With the combined merit of CONGREVE and VANBRUGH, however, and &s;uch other authors as of cour&s;e would have been glad to &s;hield their re|putations under &s;uch a protection at a di&s;tance from the folly and ignorance that marked the proceedings of the other hou&s;e, it appears to have been the la&s;t &s;tep they &s;hould have dreamt of. They gave into
<PB N="221" REF="224">
the ab&s;urdity neverthele&s;s and the theatre opened in great &s;tyle, with a tran&s;lated opera to Italian mu&s;ic, called The <HI>Triumph of Love.</HI> Which after all their pains and expence met with a very cool reception.</P>
<P>They now began to &s;ee in what their real force con&s;i&s;ted; and what they &s;hould have done by choice at fir&s;t they were con&s;trained to do at la&s;t. VAN|BRUGH brought out that plea&s;ant, and indeed valua|ble comedy, The <HI>Confedercy.</HI> Its &s;ucce&s;s, however, did not an&s;wer their expectations, and it was now all of a &s;udden di&s;covered that the fault lay in the con|&s;truction of the theatre, which was &s;o built, with all VANBRUGH's architectural knowledge, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the auditors to hear any thing di&s;|tinctly. He brought out three more comedies that year, all of which received applau&s;e, and were pretty well followed; but the &s;ame complaints was con&s;tant and general. The &s;ituation of the theatre was al&s;o objected to. The Haymarket being at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the city and the inns of court, and hackney coaches at that time being very indifferent and not &s;o well to be afforded as now. Drury Lane therefore picked up a tolerable audience to little expence while the Haymarket, with all its grandeur, had empty benches.</P>
<P>BETTERTON, whether tired of adventuring or of
<PB N="122" REF="225">
trouble, in 1607, prevailed upon his co-partners to di&s;&s;olve their agreement, and place them&s;elves un|der the direction of CONGREVE and VANBRUGH. BETTERTON him&s;elf at this time was pa&s;&s;ed &s;eventy, Mrs. BETTERTON, and UNDERHILL were &s;uper|anuated pen&s;ioners, and SMITH, KYNASTON, SAND|FORD, and LEIGH were dead; while CONGREVE and VANBRUGH, however they might &s;upply the theatre with novelty, were little capable of making engagements with other actors; who, notwith&s;tand|ing his ill treatment of them, RICH had the cunning to keep to him&s;elf. It &s;hould &s;eem as if CONGREVE had fore&s;een all this; for, fairly di&s;gu&s;ted with the concern, he brought out nothing but <HI>Semele,</HI> a very &s;hort piece, and, making VANBRUGH a pre&s;ent of his &s;hare, retired; &s;o that the &s;tory of having left the public, through the ill reception of The <HI>Way of the World,</HI> is not true, for that comedy was per|formed in 1700 at Lincoln's Inn Fields.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;teps having been taken, VANBRUGH found him&s;elf unequal to the ta&s;k of &s;u&s;taining the whole concern, and heartily wi&s;hed either to be re|lieved from it by a purcha&s;er or a coalition with the other theatre. The latter expedient he knew, how|ever, could not be attempted without extreme cau|tion, for that his opponent, in addition to his natural and profe&s;&s;ional keene&s;s, having had &s;o many diffi|culties
<PB N="223" REF="226">
to weather would of cour&s;e not only be upon his guard, but feel a degree of triumph and exulta|tion at a pro&s;pect of having it in his power, through the medium of a treaty, to dictate arrogant and &s;elf|advantageous terms. He, therefore gave the world to under&s;tand that nothing was farther from his inten|tion than parting with the concern, but that, in order to have lei&s;ure to provide it with novelty, and to look into the more material parts of its conduct, and management, he &s;hould have no objection to let it to any per&s;on willing to adventure in it, intending at the &s;ame time to back it with every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power, for a valuable con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>RICH, in the mean time, we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee to what purpo&s;e, was playing a much deeper &s;take than VANBRUGH. His own private con&s;iderations were complex and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. He had harra&s;&s;ed his partners with &s;uch vexatious demands, and teazed them with &s;uch continual litigation, put them to &s;uch expences, and warded off by chicanery the ill con&s;equences of &s;o many contempts of court, that &s;everal of tho&s;e concerned in the &s;cheme were glad to fell their &s;hares for incon&s;iderable trifles, which were bought up by RICH's agents with their own mo|ney; till at length, &s;ir THOMAS SHIPWITH, the only remaining partner of any con&s;equence gave
<PB N="224" REF="227">
away his &s;hare to colonel BRETT, who having a good deal intere&s;ted him&s;elf in the management, and brought the concern into &s;ome repute, SHIPWITH repented of his genero&s;ity and applied to the Court of Chancery for relief; upon which BRETT threw up the matter mo&s;t heartily di&s;gu&s;ted, and the que&s;tion, lying only between RICH and SHIPWITH, the latter, through &s;uperior cunning, was ou&s;ted, and the for|mer remained in exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole property, as I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter more particularly.</P>
<P>All this train of events were agitating when RICH's &s;pies and, indeed public rumour, reported VANBRUGH's inclination to form an alliance, and now came what RICH conceived to be his ma&s;ter &s;troke. He had for &s;ome time retained in his coun|cils the man in the world whom he &s;aw was be&s;t cal|culated to advi&s;e him in his perplexed &s;tate of mind, but he did not &s;ee that he was al&s;o the be&s;t calculated to over-reach him. To this man, who&s;e name was SWINEY, did RICH open his heart and, as he knew VANBRUGH's earne&s;tne&s;s to get rid of the Haymarket, it was agreed that SWINEY &s;hould take it, as an intere&s;t apparently apart from RICH, but that he &s;hould be privately under his controul. An in|terview was in con&s;equence &s;omehow procured be|tween VANBRUGH and SWINEY, who pretended
<PB N="225" REF="228">
that he was anxious to adventure for him&s;elf, and it was, after &s;ome deliberation and another meeting or two, agreed that SWINEY &s;hould take the whole concern off VANBRUGH's hands, upon paying five pounds on every day of performance, the whole &s;um not to exceed &s;even hundred a year.</P>
<P>This done, RICH was perfectly at ea&s;e. Indeed more &s;o than he ought to have been. He had hoped to have SWINEY under his thumb, and for that pur|po&s;e, among other holds on him, had taken care that he &s;hould be two hundred pounds in his debt. SWI|NEY, however, for &s;ome time kept his compact rigidly, &s;eeing very plainly that, could he once get the town, RICH would be no ob&s;tacle to his making a fortune, and this he had no doubt of as he had made it one part of his agreement, which by the way was verbal, to receive whatever di&s;contented actors might think proper to make an a&s;ylum of the Hay|market. It was now his bu&s;ine&s;s to ingratiate him|&s;elf with tho&s;e actors as much as po&s;&s;ible; and, hav|ing gained over a few whom he took care to pay punctually, others liked this lure &s;o well that at length he got the whole &s;trength of the company led by WILKS, ESTCOURT, MILLS, KEEN, JOHNSON, BULLOCK, Mrs. OLDFIELD, and Mrs. ROGERS, and afterwards CIBBER.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="229">Having now &s;uch &s;trength, he pre&s;&s;ed RICH to reduce to writing and execute formally the agree|ment between them, which had &s;tipulated that SWI|NEY's name &s;hould appear as the manager of the Haymarket theatre, but that they &s;hould divide the profits between them. This he &s;eemed the more earne&s;t to accompli&s;h, becau&s;e he knew RICH too well to believe that he would ever con&s;ent to it; for his intention all along was, by his power over SWI|NEY, to be able to declare his agreement good or void ju&s;t as might &s;uit his convenience, after an ex|periment &s;hould have been made of the &s;ucce&s;s of the &s;cheme; and thus, if the Haymarket lo&s;t, he might di&s;claim any &s;hare in it, if it gained, he might claim his proportion of the emolument.</P>
<P>SWINEY would not be put by, he declared for a full partner&s;hip or a perfect independence; and, having made his agreement with VANBRUGH, in his own name, who was well enough &s;atisfied with his punctuality thitherto, he fairly put the que&s;tion to him; upon which an open rupture took place and SWINEY, whom he had from the beginning intended to u&s;e as his tool, became his equal, and his powerful opponent, while his ingenuou&s;ne&s;s entitled him to the good opinion of the world.</P>
<P>It now became the general opinion that the two
<PB N="227" REF="230">
theatres would re&s;pectively carry on their operations, and that a generous emulation would gratify the town and fill their trea&s;uries. RICH, however, be|came more untractable than ever. The dancers were one time going to leave him out of jealou&s;y of a live elephant, which he had adverti&s;ed to exhibit, and his rope dancers became &s;o intolerably impudent that, upon an appeal to the audience by the actors, he was obliged to di&s;mi&s;s them, But it is &s;aid that it was out of this &s;ort of confu&s;ion he enriched him|&s;elf; that he was unea&s;y at good &s;ucce&s;s becau&s;e it made him accountable to his partners, and plea&s;ed when every thing went wrong becau&s;e they mu&s;t then be accountable to him; and thus, by
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"law and delay,"</Q>
&s;ays CIBBER,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he &s;o tired his ene|mies that he became &s;ole monarch of his theatrical empire, and left the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors."</Q></P>
<P>It was this kind of litigious &s;pirit that &s;o heartily tired SHIPWITH, the only remaining opponent of any con&s;equence, that he gave away his &s;hare to colonel BRETT; who, being a man of &s;pirit and a leader of the fa&s;hionable world, re&s;olved to u&s;e a little laudable indu&s;try to get the &s;tage into &s;ome|thing like reputation. In his conduct he implicitly followed the advice of CIBBER, who, with con&s;um|mate art and indu&s;try, had been t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ching him&s;elf all
<PB N="228" REF="231">
his life the complete my&s;tery of a manager. He &s;aw that a union of the two companies was the only &s;alvation of their character and their con&s;equence; and BRETT, under CIBBER's direction, availed him|&s;elf of his intimacy with the Vice Chamberlain to accompli&s;h this de&s;irable end. His &s;cheme was to have one theatre for plays and another for operas, under &s;eparate intere&s;ts; by which means the united force of all the dramatic talents would be concen|trated into one company, and &s;pectacle and exhibi|tions of mere &s;hew and &s;plendour be kept apart in its proper province.</P>
<P>This was all SWINEY wanted. ITALY had by this time heard of Engli&s;h impatience to hear their be&s;t &s;ingers. People of fa&s;hion had at their own in&s;tance invited the famous NICOLINI; and, after a proper and a &s;afe &s;tipulation, regulated by the Lord Chamberlain, that he &s;hould receive no mo|le&s;tation from RICH, it was &s;ettled that operas &s;hould be performed exclu&s;ively at the Haymarket, and plays at Drury Lane; to which place all the actors were ordered to return, and perform under the di|rection of the patentees, and to be con&s;idered as her maje&s;ty's only company of comedians.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. ACTORS.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE RHODES collected his company together, immediately before the Re&s;toration, we have &s;een nothing of actors or con&s;idered their re&s;pective merits. It will now be nece&s;&s;ary to make up for this time which I will not call lo&s;t becau&s;e I think the &s;ubject will be better di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, by introducing all the &s;ubjects into one view than if I had handled it piece-meal.</P>
<P>It has been con&s;tantly a&s;&s;erted that acting had arrived at its height of perfection in SHAKESPEAR's time; and that LOWIN, TAYLOR, ALLEYN, BUR|BAGE, and the re&s;t of that &s;et had carried the repre|&s;entation of human manners to the highe&s;t pitch of truth and nature. In what way this has been in|&s;i&s;ted on, and for what rea&s;ons, the reader has already &s;een, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed the argument is full of fea&s;ibility. When we come forwarder this ac|count is corroborated, and at the &s;ame time it is in|&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="230" REF="233">
that, though the actors between the Re&s;toration and the Revolution were materially inferior to tho&s;e in the reign of JAMES the fir&s;t, it is allowed on all hands that they were greatly &s;uperior to tho&s;e which have appeared &s;ince.</P>
<P>When the two theatres were e&s;tabli&s;hed at the Re&s;toration, the King's company was &s;upported as principal performers by HART, MOHUN, BURT, WINTERTON, LACY, CARTWRIGHT, and CLUN, to whom in a &s;hort time were added HAINES, GRIFFIN, GOODMAN, and &s;ome others. The principal women were Mrs. CORY, Mrs. MAR|SHALL, Mrs. KNAP, and afterwards Mrs. BOUTEL, and Mrs. ELENOR GWYN. The Duke's company con&s;i&s;ted of BETTERTON, SHEPPY, KYNASTON, NOKES, MOSELY, and FLOYD, who had all per|formed under RHODES. Shortly afterwards they were reinforced by PRICE, RICHARDS, and BLAC|DEN, and again by SMITH, SANDFORD, MED|BOURNE and others. The actre&s;&s;es were Mrs. DA|VENPORT, Mrs. SAUNDERS, whom BETTERTON married, Mrs. DAVIES, and Mrs. LONG, be&s;ides Mrs. GIBBS, Mrs. NORRIS, Mrs. HOLDEN, and Mrs. JENNINGS.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e actors, if we are to believe the mo&s;t di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and rational accounts of them,
<PB N="231" REF="234">
were not mere auricular imitators, not manneri&s;ts, not copies of this or that particular whim, fancy, deport|ment, voice or manner; but judges of nature through all her various workings, and clo&s;e ob&s;ervers of all the pa&s;&s;ions that move and actuate the mind of man. Nay more, they were all perfect and complete ma&s;ters in tho&s;e different &s;tyles of acting in which they cho&s;e to di&s;play their &s;everal abilities.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"BETTERTON,"</Q> &s;ays CIBBER,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was an actor as SHAKESPEAR was an author, both without competitors; formed for the mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance and illu&s;tration of each other's genius. How SHAKES|PEAR wrote, all men who have a ta&s;te for nature may read and know; but with what higher rapture would he &s;till be read could they conceive how BETTERTON played him! Then might they know that one was born alone to &s;peak what the other only knew to write."</Q>
There are &s;o many vouch|ers for the merit of this extraordinary actor, that there would be no great difficulty in a&s;certaining, or ri&s;k in a&s;&s;erting preci&s;ely what they were. I mu&s;t content my&s;elf, however, with &s;aying that it has been unanimou&s;ly allowed, his per&s;onal and mental qua|lifications for the &s;tage were correct to perfection, and that, after a variety of arguments to prove this, we are obliged to confe&s;s that he appears never to
<PB N="232" REF="235">
have been on the &s;tage for a &s;ingle moment the ac|tor but the character he performed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the early part of my life, I was very fond of every thing dramatic, and particularly curious to learn whatever I could relative to the Old School, as it was then called, but which appellation is now given to the School of GARRICK. During the the two la&s;t years of RICH's life, old Steed, who was at that time eighty, and who had been many years prompter of Covent Garden theatre, was my theatri|cal mentor. On &s;ome of his ob&s;ervations I &s;hall, as nece&s;&s;ity may oc|cur, remark, as well as avail my&s;elf of anecdotes with which he fur|ni&s;hed me He was, as may be imagined, a mo&s;t fervid advocate for the preceding race of performers, and did not &s;pare RICH, who in imitation of his father had lowered the &s;tage by pantomimes and buffoonery. This was the very time when RICH was getting up the Coronation. I heard, therefore, of cour&s;e all his &s;entiments which, though &s;omewhat bigoted, were pretty candid, and his opinion of BETTERTON was, that, though he allowed all his various merits as they had been de&s;cribed by CIBBER and his other admirers, yet taking every thing into con&s;ideration he was by no means equal to GARRICK.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>KYNASTON who performed the parts of women in his youth, of lovers in his maturer age, and of genteel old men later in life, is &s;aid to have not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a grace and an ea&s;e that nothing ever &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed, but to have thrown a peculiar dignity into every thing he performed. We are told that, though BETTERTON and KYNASTON both ob&s;erved the rules of truth and nature, they were each as different in their acting as in their form or features. This we
<PB N="233" REF="236">
know is requi&s;ite, and this particular di&s;crimination &s;eems to have made up a great part of the excellent acting of that time.</P>
<P>MONTFORD has a very warm character given of him by tho&s;e who knew him. His per&s;on was very fine and his voice melodious and winning. STEED u&s;ed to compare him to BARRY, but con&s;idered him as a &s;uperior actor, for that he was equally excellent when as the conqueror of the world he &s;ued to STA|TIRA for pardon, and when in Mirable he gave ad|ditional brilliancy to the bon mots of CONGREVE. He is &s;aid to have had &s;o much in him of the agree|able, that when he played Mrs. BEHN's di&s;&s;olute character of the Rover, it was remarked by many, and particularly by queen MARY, that it was dan|gerous to &s;ee him act he made vice &s;o alluring.</P>
<P>SANDFORD is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the com|plete&s;t and mo&s;t natural performer of a villain that ever exi&s;ted. One would think, had it been po&s;&s;i|ble, that SHAKESPEAR, when he made King John excu&s;e his intention of perpetrating the death of Arthur by his comments on Hubert's face, by which he &s;aw the a&s;&s;a&s;in in his mind, had SANDFORD in idea, for he was rather deformed and had a mo&s;t for|bidding
<PB N="234" REF="237">
countenance. The town, therefore, though the private character of this actor was perfectly amiable, could never endure him in any part in which there was the remote&s;t &s;imilitude to honour or fair dealing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">STEED related to me a whim&s;ical in&s;tance of this. In a new play, the author had allotted SANDFORD a character full of rectitude and the mo&s;t honourable &s;entiments. The audience, who had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee SANDFORD in parts of a contrary ca&s;t, imagined that all this hone&s;ty was put on, and therefore applauded the author for his art and management in having drawn the character of a villain in &s;uch di&s;&s;imulating colours, as would give great novelty and force to the denouement. But when they came to find that no friend had been betrayed, no ruin plotted, no de&s;truction accompli&s;hed, but on the contrary that SANDFORD turned out as hone&s;t a man at la&s;t as at fir&s;t, they fairly damned the play as an impo&s;ition upon their un|der&s;tandings.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such, with all the reiterated prai&s;es that lan|guage can furni&s;h, were the commendations given to the&s;e and other actors of tragedy by their co|temporaries, and in tho&s;e prai&s;es we &s;ee &s;o much ju&s;tice and propriety that we are obliged to acknow|ledge their extraordinary merit. The comic per|formers by the &s;ame accounts did not lag a whit be|hind their brothers of the bu&s;kin in fame and repu|tation. NOKES is de&s;cribed as an actor of &s;o plain and palpable a &s;implicity, &s;o perfectly his own, that
<PB N="235" REF="238">
he was as diverting in his common &s;peech as on the &s;tage. It is told of him that a nobleman, hearing him relate to the performers behind the &s;cenes a conver&s;ation that he had been witne&s;s of the day before, a&s;ked if he was repeating a new part.</P>
<P>NOKES it is &s;aid was &s;o perfectly original that ESTCOURT, with all tho&s;e powers of mimicry for which he was &s;o famous could not catch the &s;lighte&s;t glimp&s;e of him, and the rea&s;on is plain. Mimics can imitate nothing but affected peculiarities; NOKES had none of the&s;e. Very elaborate de&s;criptions have been given, by CIBBER and others, to &s;hew that he went through a large diver&s;ity of parts, and de&s;cribed feelings and pa&s;&s;ions in a manner &s;o faith|ful to nature that his comic di&s;tre&s;&s;es could not have been more natural had they ari&s;en in him&s;elf, and taken birth in his own mind, which is &s;aying in other words that he was never NOKES but the character he a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>LEIGH was fraught with humour of a more luxuriant kind. He was full of variety and per|fectly ju&s;t to whatever character he repre&s;ented. His merit, however was rather a&s;&s;umption than re|ality; which, for characters full of peculiarities, is, in performers of quick conception and &s;trong intel|lects,
<PB N="236" REF="239">
a good &s;pecies of acting; for, through this for|cible mode of colouring, they heighten parts but faintly drawn, and add fre&s;h force to tho&s;e already prominent. This was LEIGH's peculiar forte. He gave &s;o &s;trong an effect to the &s;ly and demure wick|edne&s;s of the Spani&s;h Friar, in tho&s;e &s;cenes where he connived at the intrigue between Lorenzo and the wife of Gomez, and was &s;o &s;tern and &s;o over|bearing when the &s;ituation required an exertion of clerical pride and &s;acerdotal in&s;olence, that the poet's outline of the character would have been no|thing without this admirable fini&s;h by the actor; and, upon other occa&s;ions he lifted parts into con|&s;equence as much above their u&s;ual level as he ex|alted this and others beyond even the conception of tho&s;e who wrote them.</P>
<P>UNDERHIL was &s;omething between NOKES and LEIGH. He was true to nature in his acting both from adventitious endowments and good &s;en&s;e. He performed tho&s;e parts which, though they are con&s;i|dered as &s;econdary in plays, require very frequently more judgment than tho&s;e which are called principal, and at the &s;ame time demand a mode of acting per|fectly con&s;i&s;tent and natural. Such characters are the very &s;inews of a play, and ought to be knit by the author with &s;trength, and exerted by the actor with
<PB N="237" REF="240">
judgment. The&s;e parts are the fathers and guardians, &s;uch for in&s;tance as Sir Samp&s;on Legend in <HI>Love for Love.</HI> He was al&s;o remarkable in the Grave|digger in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and the <HI>Tatler</HI> recommends him to the town upon that plays being acted for his benefit.</P>
<P>The&s;e actors of whom I have thought it nece&s;|&s;ary to give this de&s;cription were the flower of that company which united in 1684, at which time, as I have already ob&s;erved, HART, who al&s;o was an ex|cellent actor, had left the &s;tage. MOHUN was dead, and &s;everal others were either dead or had re|tired. GOODMAN CLARK, and many more might al&s;o be &s;poken of with great propriety, for it is a re|markable thing, which by the way I never &s;aw &s;ince I have known the &s;tage but in the time of GARRICK, and never correctly with him except in tho&s;e plays he acted him&s;elf, that let their &s;ituations be principal or &s;ubordinate it was their &s;tudy to be re&s;pectable. The underlings felt like apprentices at a trade of which every one hoped to become in time a ma&s;ter. They thought it the height of ab&s;urdity to expect to arrive at perfection till it could be gradually at|tained; they con&s;idered it as building in the air and ornamenting the &s;uper&s;tructure before they had lain the foundation, and the po&s;ition is &s;o ju&s;t, that I'll
<PB N="238" REF="241">
venture to &s;ay half the crudities which we have been &s;o often a&s;toni&s;hed and di&s;gu&s;ted at, and which at length get into hardne&s;&s;es and take every form but nature, are entirely owing to fir&s;t appearances in principal characters; but I leave with the recollec|tion of the public how many who have pur&s;ued this dangerous road ever arrived to the achme of their art.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation applies to women in particular who have very &s;eldom arrived to perfection as ac|tre&s;&s;es before the female graces have in &s;ome degree left them. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;hort life of beauty,"</Q> &s;ays an au|thor,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is not long enough to form a complete ac|tre&s;s,"</Q>
and the &s;eparate merits of almo&s;t every actre&s;s I &s;hall have to dwell on will bear out this a&s;|&s;ertion. Before, however, I enter upon that ta&s;k I &s;hall go on with my account of the actors till 1708.</P>
<P>POWEL, who was added to the company &s;oon after its union felt an early ambition to perform capital parts; and, when RICH quarrelled with his actors and BETTERTON had it in his idea to leave him, with the utmo&s;t pre&s;umption POWELL agreed to accept of his characters, &s;ome of which he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of and almo&s;t the whole of MONTFORD's, when WILKS having arrived from IRELAND, was

expected to do wonders. This is the &s;tronge&s;t light I can put the merit of the&s;e actors into. WILKS who&s;e abilities, which were promi&s;ing though raw and unformed, would have &s;unk to nothing upon a compari&s;on with BETTERTON and MONTFORD, be|came a &s;ucce&s;sful rival to POWEL, who in dudgeon walked off to Lincoln Inn Fields. WILKS, how|ever, improved every day, and in time, in &s;pight of &s;ome peculiarities, became an excellent actor; while POWELL, after trying one winter with BETTERTON, where he was more lo&s;t than ever, returned to his old quarters, and after a &s;hort contention fairly gave up the palm to his competitor.</P>
<P>WILKS was a &s;ober indu&s;trious man, and POWEL a very different character; circum&s;tances which, in particular after COLLIER's book, weighed con&s;i|derably in the opinion of the public. It is remark|able that BOOTH, who, in the very year WILKS left DUBLIN for Drury Lane, left it al&s;o for Lincoln's Inn Fields, and who had in IRELAND been a pretty free lover of the bottle, was, &s;ome time after his ar|rival in LONDON, &s;o &s;hocked at the contempt and di&s;tre&s;s that POWEL had plunged him&s;elf into by the vice of hard drinking, that he in&s;tantly made a re&s;o|lution, which he never broke, of utterly abandoning that practice, and to this circum&s;tance there can be

no doubt but the world are indebted for &s;o admira|ble an actor.</P>
<P>VERBRUGGEN, PINKETHMAN, WILLIAMS, BUL|LOCK, and others, were actors of con&s;iderable merit in their way, and DOGGET, more generally known to us by his coat and badge than his acting, is &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch natural comic powers that it was CONGREVE's delight to write for him; but I &s;hall have better occa&s;ion to mention him hereafter, when I de&s;cribe him as manager in conjunction with CIBBER and WILKS, at which time I &s;hall deliver my &s;entiments of CIBBER, a man who&s;e whole life was acting and management, who knew dramatic conduct intuitively, who without any very &s;triking requi&s;ites, either as an author or as an actor, held a very re&s;pectable &s;ituation in both capacities, and who &s;eems to have &s;een &s;o far into the womb of time as to di&s;cover when he had only fifteen &s;hillings a week, that he &s;hould one day have a thou&s;and a year as a manager be&s;ides his emoluments as an author.</P>
<P>Having taken a cur&s;ory view of the actors I &s;hall now &s;peak of the different merits of the ac|tre&s;&s;es, among whom Mrs. BARRY &s;eems to claim the preference, and of whom DRYDEN &s;ays in his
<PB N="241" REF="244">
preface to <HI>Cleomenes,</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mrs. BARRY always excel|lent has in this tragedy excelled her&s;elf, and gained a reputation beyond any woman I have &s;een on the theatre."</Q>
We are told that, however DRYDEN might have been charmed with this lady at that time, and however truly &s;he might have de&s;erved his panegyric, &s;he was by no means arrived to that per|fection that &s;he afterwards attained, that if her act|ing was then meritorious, it was afterwards incom|parable, and that for nearly forty years &s;he continued to improve in judgment and di&s;crimination; a &s;trong proof of the ob&s;ervation I quoted ju&s;t now.</P>
<P>Mrs. BARRY in characters of greatne&s;s is &s;aid to have been graceful, noble and dignified; that no violence of pa&s;&s;ion was beyond the reach of her feelings, and that in the mo&s;t melting di&s;tre&s;s and tenderne&s;s &s;he was exqui&s;itely affecting. Thus &s;he was equally admirable in Ca&s;&s;andra, Cleopatra, Roxana, Monimia, or Belvidera. She was the fir&s;t actre&s;s who was indulged with a benefit play, a fa|vour for &s;ome time after given only as a di&s;tinction of merit.</P>
<P>Mrs. BETTERTON was remarkable for perform|ing the female characters of SHAKESPEAR to a
<PB N="242" REF="245">
greater degree of excellence than any other actre&s;s before or &s;ince, which exhibits a mo&s;t &s;triking proof that &s;he mu&s;t have been critically a judge of nature; for, though many of them are purpo&s;ely underwrit|ten becau&s;e they were performed in SHAKESPEAR's time by men, yet there is a feminine truth and beauty in them more winning than all we find in tho&s;e over|charged characters which, in &s;ome of the more mo|dern tragedies, a mode we have borrowed from the French, &s;eem to have all the conduct of the piece. The fact is that, when women come to grace the &s;tage, the authors were &s;o delighted at this plea&s;ura|ble and advantageous circum&s;tance, that they did not know how to hu&s;band it, but as much over&s;hot the mark as their predece&s;&s;ors had come &s;hort of it. It is related of Mrs. BETTERTON that, though Lady Macbeth had been frequently well performed, no actre&s;s, not even Mrs. BARRY, could in the &s;malle&s;t degree be compared to her. Her judgment as an ac|tre&s;s is &s;aid to have been &s;o con&s;ummate that no fe|male performer &s;ucceeded who did not imitate her, or failed who did.</P>
<P>Mrs. LEIGH was a comic performer and emi|nently &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;uch parts as Lady Wi&s;hfort. Mrs. BUTLER was equally excellent in Coquettes, but Mrs. MONTFORD, and Mrs. BRACEGIRDLE,
<PB N="243" REF="246">
were mo&s;t admirable comic actre&s;&s;es indeed. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that no actre&s;s ever performed &s;o variou&s;ly as Mrs. MONTFORD. She had every &s;pecies of native humour at command, &s;he was equally natural in characters of high and low life, and would with the &s;ame ea&s;e and fidelity per&s;onate an affected co|quette in a drawing room, and a dowdy in a cottage; to all which &s;he added the talents of being a mo&s;t inimitable mimic, and is &s;aid to have played Bayes in the <HI>Rehear&s;al</HI> upon a particular occa&s;ion, probably a benefit, with more variety than had ever been thrown into it before.</P>
<P>Mrs. BRACECIRDLE, a name that has always been mentioned with great re&s;pect, both on account of her public merit, and her private virtues. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">|dered her&s;elf a valuable ornament to the theatre, and to &s;ociety. She had many admirers, and authors, when they have vied with each other in &s;cenes of tenderne&s;s, are &s;aid to have written them only to make their court to her. As to her acting both au|thors and performers courted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her talents, which were univer&s;al. She equally delighted in melting tenderne&s;s, and playful coquettry, in Statira, or Millamant, and even at an advanced age, when &s;he played Angelica in <HI>Love for Love,</HI> for BET|TERTON's benefit, &s;he retained all her power of plea&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="247">Having noticed &s;ix actre&s;&s;es who made up, in CIBBER's opinion, together with tho&s;e actors I have mentioned from BETTERTON to UNDERHIL, thir|teen performers, who for great, various, and extra|ordinary talents never had or could have their equal, I &s;hall defer introducing Mrs. OLDRIELD, Mrs. ROGERS, and tho&s;e other females, who were at this time coming forward, by way of a gradual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and who when the companies were united in 1708, had given no mean proof of their progre&s;s towards perfection.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. SHADWELL, SEDLEY, &amp;c. RESUMED.</HEAD>
<P>SHADWELL brought out The <HI>Squire of Al&s;atia,</HI> in the very year of the Revolution. This play is founded upon the <HI>Adephi</HI> of TERENCE; and, for a &s;ubject that had then and has been &s;ince to repeat|edly treated, it is by no means a bad play. There is, however, too much of the low and the vulgar in it, and when it was revived by WOODWARD on his re|turn from Ireland, though it was admirably acted, it on this account was &s;oon withdrawn. It had originally &s;o much cant, or what is vulgarly called &s;lang, that the author was obliged to add a glo&s;&s;ary to the publication.</P>
<P><HI>Bury Fair,</HI> 1689, was borrowed from the Duke of NEWCASTLE's <HI>Triumphant Widow,</HI> and <HI>Les Pre|cieu&s;es Ridicules</HI> of MOLIERE. DAVENANT, BET|TERTON, and Mrs BEHN, nibbled at the &s;ame bait,
<PB N="246" REF="249">
which, however it might catch them, was not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;wallowed by their audiences. The <HI>Amorous Bigot.</HI> This was a party play which, &s;peaking of the circum&s;tance of Teague O'Divelly, I have de|&s;cribed in another place. The <HI>Scowerers,</HI> 1693, was his la&s;t play, and, perhaps, the mo&s;t indifferent of them all, which will be credited when the reader is informed that it is much lower and more vulgar than the <HI>Squire of Al&s;atia,</HI> without half &s;o good a vehicle to convey effect or intere&s;t. Let us then take leave of SHADWELL; a writer certainly of merit enough to convince the world that, however, if per&s;onality were allowable, FLECKNOE de&s;erved in his own right DRYDEN's mo&s;t cau&s;tic &s;atire, the the ridicule aimed at SHADWELL, had le&s;s in it of truth and ju&s;tice, than envy and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>The dramatic pieces of SEDLEY after the Re|volution were <HI>Beauty the Conqueror, or the Death of Marc Anthony,</HI> which was written on the Roman model, and therefore never acted. The <HI>Grumbler,</HI> which did very ill at fir&s;t, and wor&s;e &s;ince, when it was cut down to a farce, and The <HI>Tyrant, King of Crete</HI> a play which though publi&s;hed in this au|thor's works was never performed. The character of SEDLEY cannot be known from his plays, which, like the productions of the fine gentlemen of that
<PB N="247" REF="250">
time, were chiefly written for amu&s;ement. The latter part of his life was decorous, and indeed ex|emplary. He was, however, a <HI>bon vivant,</HI> to the la&s;t, and died as a poet expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"with a je&s;t in his mouth and a tear in his eye."</Q></P>
<P>LEE produced, 1689, The <HI>Prince&s;s of Cleves,</HI> and in 1690, The <HI>Ma&s;&s;acre of Paris.</HI> His be&s;t dramatic merit was however pa&s;t: The fir&s;t of the&s;e plays, though it has fits and &s;tarts of fire and energy is de|clamatory and de&s;ultory, and the other has too much frenzy and too little regularity, but we mu&s;t not wonder at this, for the&s;e two plays were written after he had been confined in Bedlam four years, to which place his &s;trong mind and his exce&s;s of &s;en&s;i|bility forced him; a circum&s;tance that ought to re|&s;pite many an indi&s;criminate denunciation ready to i&s;&s;ue from the lips of uncandid critics, in favour of that hard, that difficult, that thankle&s;s toil which men of genius endure, when for precarious fame they generou&s;ly diffu&s;e the light of knowledge to chear their fellow creatures.</P>
<P>SETTLE produced eight plays after the Revo|lution. <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Innocence, or the Prince&s;s of Per&s;ia,</HI> had good &s;ucce&s;s; it is impo&s;&s;ible, however, to add de&s;ervedly. The author acknowledges many
<PB N="284" REF="251">
obligations to BETTERTON and MOUNTFORD, who wrote between them &s;everal &s;cenes in it. If this in|different play &s;ucceeded, to ballance accounts, The <HI>Ambitious Slave,</HI> a piece of more merit, was damned. <HI>Phila&s;ter</HI> was of cour&s;e BEAUMONT and FLETCHER's play with alterations; but they were not judicious, and what was more unfortunate the town thought &s;o. The&s;e three plays were performed 1691, 1694, and 1695. The <HI>World in the Moon,</HI> 1697, was a kind of opera, which SETTLE wrote to curry favour with RICH, to whom it was dedicated. It was brought out to di&s;play decoration, and &s;o far an&s;wered the in|tended purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Virgin Prophete&s;s,</HI> 1701, is a &s;trange mad play, written from the &s;tory of <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra.</HI> It was a kind of opera; but it did very little, notwith&s;tanding RICH, who was at that time u&s;ing SETTLE as one of his tools, did his utmo&s;t to pu&s;h it forward. The <HI>City Ramble,</HI> &s;tolen from the <HI>Knight of the Burning Pe&s;tle,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Drolls</HI> written for Bartholomew Fair, conclude the works of ELKINAH SETTLE, playwright, critic, turncoat, &s;hewman, city poet, and to clo&s;e his character, panegyri&s;t of Judge JEFFERIES.</P>
<P>DURFEY produced after the Revolution &s;ixteen

pieces of different de&s;criptions, mo&s;t of which were mutilated from other authors or el&s;e a compound of their writings. It would be very unprofitable to follow them up with any clo&s;e remarks. <HI>Love for Money,</HI> which was &s;tolen from &s;everal things, and from which COFFEY &s;tole his <HI>Boarding School R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">mps, Marriage Hater Match<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d,</HI> remarkable for nothing but bringing DOGGET into public notice, whole ad|mirable performance of a very bad part only kept it on its legs for &s;ix nights; <HI>Cynthia and Endymion</HI> who Mr. DURFEY, by way of con&s;i&s;tency, makes Diana a &s;trumpet, and Syrens &s;omething wor&s;e. <HI>Bu&s;&s;y D'Amboi&s;e,</HI> &s;poilt from <HI>Chapman</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;oniello</HI> from the <HI>Rebellion of Naples,</HI> make up a part of them, the re&s;t were known by the following titles, <HI>Richmond Heire&s;s, Don Quixote,</HI> three parts. <HI>Intrigues of Ver|&s;ailles, Campaigners,</HI> The <HI>Bath, Wonders in the Sun, Modern P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">phets.</HI> The <HI>Old Mode and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> New,</HI> The <HI>Two Queens of Brentford,</HI> The <HI>Grecian Hero.</HI> and <HI>Ariadne.</HI> In &s;hort every body liked DURFEY as a companion, and, therefore, wi&s;hed him to get a &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, and thus what his friends were obliged to deduct from the merit of the fact, they were glad to accord to the good nature of the man.</P>
<P>There are five plays to come which were written
<PB N="250" REF="253">
by CROWNE. <HI>Darius,</HI> 1688, The <HI>Engli&s;h Friars,</HI> 1690, <HI>Regulus,</HI> 1694, The <HI>Married Beau,</HI> 1694, <HI>Caligula,</HI> 1698, and <HI>Ju&s;tice Bu&s;y,</HI> which was not printed, nor can the date be acertained. None of the&s;e plays were equal either in the writing or &s;uc|ce&s;s to tho&s;e which went before them. CROWNE's forte was by no means tragedy, and his &s;ubjects, be|ing merely from remote hi&s;tory, and conducted upon the plan of <HI>Seneca,</HI> without the erudition or the di&s;|crimination of JONSON, no wonder they &s;unk under their own burden. As for his comedies he &s;hould have &s;topt at <HI>Sir Courtly Nice,</HI> for by this time the reformers got to work, and he among the re&s;t was forced into a vindication of his conduct, and an apology for the loo&s;ene&s;s of his morals.</P>
<P>BANKS brought out The <HI>Innocent U&s;urper</HI> in 1694, and <HI>Cyrus the Great</HI> in 1696. Both of the&s;e plays were forbidden. The fir&s;t under an idea that it reflected on government, and the other nobody knows why; but BANKS, though an indifferent writer, had &s;o peculiar a mode of introducing pa|thetic and touching &s;ituation, that the venal, the un|principled, and the ambitious, got at length a knack of tingling at that imaginary rod which they fancied, while he depicted nature, he held up at them.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="254">BANKS wrote a very proper, but an unavailing vindication of him&s;elf in relation to the <HI>Innocent U&s;urper,</HI> which is the &s;tory of Lady Jane Gray, and which has more pathos, though it is not &s;o well written, than ROWE's tragedy upon the &s;ame &s;ub|ject; but as for <HI>Cyrus,</HI> government &s;eemed to take &s;hame to it&s;elf for having been frightened at a &s;ha|dow for how &s;o remote and &s;o inapplicable a &s;tory could affect them, unle&s;s upon the broad principle that all men in power are equally vulnerable on the &s;core of venality, it is not very ea&s;y to explain. The author, however, was &s;till unfortunate; for a &s;hort time after it had been re&s;tored to the &s;tage, the repre&s;entation of <HI>Cyrus</HI> died, &s;ince when the au|thor withdrew him and his play from the public.</P>
<P>Two plays written by Mrs. BEHN remain to be &s;poken of. Their titles are The <HI>Widow Ranter,</HI> and The <HI>Younger Brother.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e came out in 1690. It is a tragi-comedy, and a mo&s;t incon|gruous bu&s;ine&s;s indeed. This is not, however, won|derful, for if what we have examined already, written in the prime of life, were &s;o full of the ecentric, it is very unlikely that her mental faculties were grown &s;tronger a year or two before her death at which time this piece was produced. DRYDEN, upon the production of this piece, furni&s;hed a prologue to it,
<PB N="252" REF="255">
which, as BAYES &s;ays, might have &s;erved for any other, for there is not a &s;ingle allu&s;ion to the play from the beginning to the end.</P>
<P>The <HI>Younger Brother,</HI> though not produced till after Mrs. BEHN's death, does not labour under the &s;ame predicament, for &s;he took uncommon pains with it, and had been ten years preparing it for the &s;tage. It had however very little &s;ucce&s;s, the literary atmo&s;phere was now purifying very fa&s;t, and there|fore became unable to &s;u&s;t in tho&s;e gro&s;s bodies that had been accu&s;tomed to float in it; and, as Mrs. BEHN was one of the projectors that &s;ported the&s;e &s;ulphurious balloons, no wonder that &s;he, the very <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;iori de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ilatre</HI> of the tribe, &s;hould experience a chute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Having &s;poken in unqualified terms on the &s;ubject of Mrs. BEHN, I may perhaps be blamed, by tho&s;e who think it &s;queami&s;h to dev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ate in opinion from the bold, naked, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">emine virtue, which was p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">cable in SPARTA, and which Mrs. WOOLSTONCROFT would have made us believe ought to be practicable in ENGLAND; to which I &s;hall an&s;wer, re&s;erving to my&s;elf &s;ome exceptions that literature would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">ned &s;omething and dome&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">c happine&s;s a great deal, had fewer ladies invented epithets and fondly fancied they had written poetry.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. DRYDEN RESUMED.</HEAD>
<P>AS the mo&s;t di&s;gracious part of examining DRYDEN relates to his plays and the controver&s;ies that &s;prung from them, let us get over tho&s;e that we may have the gratification of according him more fully that tribute of prai&s;e and admiraton which as a poet are eminently due to his wonderful and extraordinary talents.</P>
<P><HI>Don Seba&s;tian,</HI> performed in 1690, is by &s;ome e&s;teemed DRYDEN's be&s;t play; whence however this judgment has ari&s;en cannot be ea&s;ily conceived; for, though there is &s;ome fine, &s;pirited, and poetic writing in it, there is al&s;o &s;o much incongruity and extraneou&s;ne&s;s that, for conduct, &s;urely it is cer|tainly one of the wor&s;t. In the fir&s;t place it is ad|mitted that it is &s;o long that it cannot be acted all at once, and what &s;ort of prai&s;e mu&s;t that writer intend who &s;ub&s;cribes at the &s;ame time to the excellence of
<PB N="255" REF="258">
this play, and in&s;i&s;ts that there are comic &s;cenes re|lative to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of princes and the vi&s;&s;itudes of empires which that age did not commend, and this would not indure. It is in fact what DRYDEN's plays generally are; it contains writing which might add lu&s;tre to a great author, and conduct that might di&s;grace an indifferent one.</P>
<P><HI>Amphitrion</HI> next came forward; it was performed in 1691. The reader knows the play, that it is a mixture of PLAUTUS and MOLIERE, and that it has great merit; but the merit is entirely on the &s;ide of the writing, and even that is injurious to this pro|duction, con&s;idered as a dramatic piece, in pro|portion as it is beautiful and &s;educing. The whole conduct of it is &s;o profligate and openly licentious, that though it has been often revived and embelli&s;hed in various ways, its &s;ucce&s;s has never an&s;wered the experiment. The univer&s;al report of it is that it is not a lady's play, and why, after &s;o ju&s;t a character of it has been given, has it ever been &s;oi&s;ted on the public with all its &s;ins upon its head. Jupiter's com|mitting adultery and excu&s;ing it to Amphytrion by informing him that Hercules would be the i&s;&s;ue of his intercour&s;e with Alemina, upon which Socia dryly remarks
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the&s;e gods know how to gild a bitter pill,"</Q>
be&s;ides the peculiar glance it takes at a
<PB N="256" REF="259">
mo&s;t &s;acred fact, is as profligate as the circum&s;tance of the pirate; who, after he had landed upon an i&s;land and robbed a church in the night, upon &s;ee|ing a fair breeze &s;prung up, to cover his e&s;cape, <Q REND="inline">"See,"</Q> &s;aid he to the crew,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how the gods favour &s;acrilege."</Q></P>
<P>In this play, though in the provokingly laughable humour of Socia, DRYDEN has fal&s;ified his own &s;en|timents of him&s;elf, for it proves that he was a judge of whatever was truly comic, and though there is &s;ome of the &s;weete&s;t writing that can be imagined, its whole tendency is immoral and irreligious. Ju|piter congratulates him&s;elf on his meditated conque&s;t on Alemena, and prai&s;es the con&s;ummate &s;agacity which he had u&s;ed in forming woman, which de|&s;cribes her as every thing the rever&s;e of amiable, for he &s;ays he gave her two &s;weet eyes to grant, and but one mouth to &s;ay nay; but let us have done with Amphytrion, a &s;ubject which has been treated in|effectually by eminent writers of all ages, and which proves, therefore, that it is not in human ability to make that perfect which is radically wrong.</P>
<P><HI>Arthur</HI> was produced al&s;o in the year 1691. This piece, and the beautiful mu&s;ic of PURCELL that embelli&s;hes it, are &s;o perfectly in every body's
<PB N="257" REF="260">
recollection that it will be very little nece&s;&s;ary to dwell on it. The piece it&s;elf is extravagant, but it is a ma&s;que, and in it DRYDEN has had many opportunities to di&s;play his abilities as a lyric poet, &s;tyle in which he ever &s;o eminently excelled. It cannot, therefore, be ranked as the meane&s;t of his dramatic works; and, when we add the captivating melodies of PURCELL, it exhibits a very &s;trong claim to public admiration, for nothing has, perhaps, more univer&s;ally excelled, or will be longer admired than <HI>Lovely I&s;le, I call all you to Woden's Hall. Come if you dare, To Arms,</HI> and <HI>Britons Strike Home.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cleomenes.</HI> This tragedy, which appeared in 1692, has, like the re&s;t of DRYDEN's works, &s;ome remarkable fine pa&s;&s;ages. It was decried in &s;uch a way as evinced a &s;orene&s;s about his enemies which was equal to a tacit confe&s;&s;ion of its merit. This warmth of invective again&s;t it was particularly no|ticeable at court, which induced many box loun|gers to &s;neer at the piece and its author. The <HI>Guardian</HI> relates that, as DRYDEN came one night from the repre&s;entation of <HI>Cleomenes,</HI> he was ac|co&s;ted by &s;ome young &s;op of fa&s;hion with the&s;e words,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Had I been left alone with a young beauty, I would not have &s;pent my time like your Spar|tan."</Q>
<PB N="258" REF="261">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That &s;ir is true, perhaps,"</Q> &s;aid DRYDEN;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but give me leave to tell you, you are no hero!"</Q></P>
<P><HI>Love Triumphant,</HI> the la&s;t of DRYDEN's dramatic pieces, has great merit, but it is only in places. On the whole, by the author's own confe&s;&s;ion, it is de|fective. It &s;hould &s;eem as if DRYDEN, having &s;et it down as an axiom that the &s;tage was not his talent, took it altogether for granted, and therefore did not pu&s;h his merit as far as it would go; for it cannot be, had he taken &s;ufficient pains to have weeded his plays of tho&s;e gro&s;s improprieties which he calls his &s;hame, but his dramatic fame would have &s;tood upon much higher ground. <HI>All for Love,</HI> and The <HI>Spani&s;h Friar,</HI> in their way, rank very forward indeed, and manife&s;t extraordinary proofs of tran&s;cendant merit The apology for DRYDEN has con&s;tantly been that he undertook to bring out four plays in a year; CIBBER, however, &s;ays two, and even this is more than the fact; for, upon an examination of the dates, we &s;hall find that twenty-&s;even plays were performed in thirty years, and though he worked very hard in 1672, and 1673, except in two in&s;tances, he brought out no more than one play in any other given year.</P>
<P>This certainly, con&s;idering his other pur&s;uits,
<PB N="259" REF="262">
was more than enough; and, when we add that what a man does for mere bread, e&s;pecially if he has not an opinion of his talents for that &s;ort of work, comes not from the mind with &s;uch willingne&s;s nor &s;uch ability as other efforts, the children of inclination, the wonder will be not how he wrote &s;o ill but how he wrote &s;o much; and, if we did not e&s;timate the matter in this way, how completely DRYDEN's merit would kick the beam weighed again&s;t SHAKESPEAR, who certainly produced in twenty-five years thirty-&s;even plays, out of which The <HI>Comedy of Errors, Hamlet,</HI> and <HI>King John,</HI> were written in a year &s;o were The <HI>Mid&s;ummer Nights Dream,</HI> and <HI>Romeo and Juliet, Much Ado about Nothing,</HI> and <HI>As you Like It</HI>; and with the difference of a &s;hort interval <HI>Lear, Macbeth,</HI> and The <HI>Taming of the Shrew.</HI> Whenever we con&s;ider this, and al&s;o con&s;ider what plays they were, it is ridiculous to re&s;t DRYDEN's defence on the mere plea of time. We &s;hall pre|&s;ently be able to find a much better; in the interim we will take leave of his plays ob&s;erving that the wor&s;t of them has more of the true merit of a great and extraordinary writer, than the be&s;t of the major part of his cotemporaries.</P>
<P>Before I look a little into the other works of DRYDEN, which I lament that I mu&s;t do in a very
<PB N="260" REF="263">
cur&s;ory way, it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ee how far his plays improved his fortune, in which enquiry we &s;hall have the mortification to find that they did not relieve him from that that of exigency and de|pendence of which he always complains, and from which he never was free. He had but one night at any time for a play, though SOUTHERN &s;hortly after him had two, and ROWE &s;oon after him had three; and as it has been calculated that play, de|dication, and copy did not yield him upon an average more than a hundred pounds, what a &s;lender in|come he mu&s;t have depended upon to have lived like a gentleman and have maintained a family, for his poems, in proportion, mu&s;t have been as unpro|ductive, e&s;pecially if he wrote them all upon the &s;ame terms; for we find a document which proves that he &s;old ten thou&s;and ver&s;es to TONSON the book&s;eller for two hundred and fifty guineas, about the twentieth of what POPE received for the &s;ame number of lines in his tran&s;lation of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>To go into the &s;ubject of DRYDEN's poems at any length would he here particularly obtru&s;ive; a circum&s;tance, perhaps, at which I ought to rejoice, becau&s;e of the difficulty in doing ju&s;tice to writings of &s;uch ine&s;timable value. His original poetry was
<PB N="261" REF="264">
often occa&s;ional, and, therefore, unfortunately like his dedications, too full of that literal fiction, which, as we have &s;een in the ca&s;e of WALLER, is not the true province of poetry. To congratulate a monarch on his re&s;toration to his honours, and his native country, or a nation on the birth of a prince, may fill a poet's mind with every becoming kind of fer|vour, but the impo&s;&s;ibility of conducting &s;uch &s;ub|jects, except through the medium of hyperbole and exaggeration, is evident, and &s;uch addre&s;&s;es, there|fore become little more than dedications in ver&s;e.</P>
<P>Other &s;ubjects however, though occa&s;ional, were more general, and in the&s;e the poet has had a wider field to expatiate in. To prophecy how a king will govern, or what will be the endowments of a young prince, is an effort attended with difficulty and hazard; but to dwell on the valour of generals who have nobly fought, and have been loudly applauded, as the de|liverers of their country, is grateful, worthy, and pa|triotic, and, therefore, the <HI>Annus Mirabilis</HI> has every thing to exalt and nothing to humilate the poet, while the <HI>A&s;traea Redux</HI> and the <HI>Britannia Rediviva</HI> &s;tamp on the beauty of poetry the blu&s;h of venality, and lo&s;e the writer in the <HI>Hyperboli&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ab&s;alom and Achitophel,</HI> and The <HI>Hind and the</HI>
<PB N="262" REF="265">
<HI>Panther,</HI> are occa&s;ional in another way. One is na|tional, the other religious, and may be both termed Satires. The&s;e &s;ubjects were very warm in his mind, and &s;eem to be written with great hone&s;ty, and an un&s;hackled independence. The fir&s;t is aimed at the faction, which through Lord SHAFTESBURY at|tempted to place the crown on the head of the Duke of MONMOUTH, and the other is a defence of the religion which he appears to have embraced from principle. Taken as a poem, the fir&s;t has infinitely the preference; the allu&s;ions have no violence, no incongruity, no incon&s;i&s;tency, the &s;atire is &s;trong, but it is manly, and the cau&s;e is becoming and me|ritorious. In the other the vehicle, which, if the &s;ubject were rendered allu&s;ively, would, perhaps, well bear out the author, defeats its own end. The <HI>Hind and Panther</HI> might have been figuratively religious bigots, and in that quality maintained their own tenets, which would have afforded in&s;truction with great propriety through the medium of allegory; but, when bea&s;ts are made to &s;peak of our Saviour and his apo&s;tles the &s;cripture, St. Paul the Pope, Luther Jehu and Zuinglius, the &s;potted Panther in|&s;tantly a&s;&s;umes a gown and ca&s;&s;ock, and the milk white hind &s;helters her&s;elf behind a friar's cowl. Take the fir&s;t of the&s;e productions, however, as poetry, and the other as poetical writing, it is ex|tremely
<PB N="263" REF="266">
difficult to &s;ay which contains &s;uperior beauty, or where again, in this language &s;uch beauty can be found.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Medal,</HI> and <HI>Religio Laici,</HI> the &s;ame &s;ub|jects are followed up, but with different &s;ucce&s;s; for the <HI>Medal</HI> is inferior to <HI>Ab&s;alom and Achitophel,</HI> to which it &s;eems intended as the &s;uper&s;tructure, and <HI>Religio Laici</HI> is &s;uperior to the <HI>Hind and Panther,</HI> having more &s;ubject, and better foundation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Heroic Stanzas on the death of Oliver Crom|well,</HI> The <HI>Poem on the death of Charles the Second,</HI> which was le&s;s happy, The <HI>Satire on the Dutch, and Mac Flecknoe,</HI> are al&s;o among his occa&s;ional writings. In all the&s;e he has &s;hewn a great deal of poetical dexterity, and, upon the &s;ame principle that he pur|&s;ued in his prefaces and dedications, he has lavi&s;hed pointed &s;atire, or warm prai&s;e, with a &s;trength and a diver&s;ity only known to his mind, and performed by his pen. It is but too true that the &s;atire was often invective and the prai&s;e adulation; the two &s;ubjects of all others mo&s;t repugnant to liberality, and inde|pendence of &s;pirit; yet in this, as well as in many other things, the writer &s;eems to have prevailed over the man, as if there was no ta&s;k, however revolting and ungrateful, but great talents and great ability
<PB N="264" REF="267">
would render creditable and advantageous, though the motives of the&s;e productions, and the &s;entiments they contain are an injury to the private character of DRYDEN, they add a &s;trength and a &s;plendor to his public reputation.</P>
<P>The principal original works of DRYDEN are, The <HI>Epi&s;tles,</HI> The <HI>Prologues and Epilogues,</HI> The <HI>Songs, Elegies, and Epitaphs,</HI> The <HI>Secular Ma&s;que,</HI> The <HI>Ode on St. Cecelia's Day,</HI> and <HI>Alexander's Fea&s;t.</HI> The&s;e are all &s;weetly poetical, and in them the mind &s;eems to have been more at home; and, though they may &s;ome of them be con&s;idered as occa&s;ional, yet they were cho&s;en, not enjoined, and therefore they are more effu&s;ion than employment. Many of the epi&s;tles &s;hew that he had panegyric at will for his friends as well as for his patrons, and that, however nece&s;&s;ity might have induced him occa&s;ionally to flatter, inclination ballanced the account by giving him opportunity to be ju&s;t. His epi&s;tles and his elegies therefore &s;eem not to have more beauty than &s;incerity, and as to his prologues, and epilogues, all the world mu&s;t agree with CONGREVE, that if he had written nothing el&s;e they would have entitled him to the prai&s;e of excellence in its kind.</P>
<P>The <HI>Secular Ma&s;que</HI> is a trifle, but it is a beau|tiful
<PB N="265" REF="268">
one. The &s;ong alone of <HI>With Horns and with Hounds,</HI> which BOYCE has &s;o deliciou&s;ly &s;et, is the e&s;&s;ence of lyric poetry contained in eight lines The <HI>Ode on St. Cecelia's Day,</HI> is an exqui&s;ite poem and wonderfully well adapted for mu&s;ic. The de&s;crip|tion of the different in&s;truments, which the poetry commands to be predominant, is a beautiful outline for the compo&s;er, which, however, HANDEL knew not how to take advantage of, who&s;e mu&s;ic every where manife&s;ts that he had but little ta&s;te for the charms of poetry, and therefore this exqui&s;ite pro|duction has never been &s;een in a dre&s;s adequate to its beauty.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Alexander's Fea&s;t,</HI> it will be the le&s;s re|qui&s;ite to expatiate on its excellence &s;ince all the world feels, and all the critics allow, which is a mi|raculous conjunction, that it &s;tands without a rival, to which has been added that, if it is excelled in parts, tho&s;e parts are only to be found in the works of DRYDEN. I mu&s;t again lament that &s;uch a poet fell into the hands of &s;uch a mu&s;ician. This, how|ever, is not the place, nor am I yet ripe for my ob|&s;ervations on HANDEL; they will come better here|after. One author calling this poem DRYDEN's wonderful Ode, &s;ays that it is worth all that PIN|DAR
<PB N="266" REF="269">
has written, as a large diamond is worth a va&s;t heap of gold, but I mu&s;t not indulge my&s;elf with enumerating the univer&s;al prai&s;e that has been be|&s;towed on this effort of in&s;piration, which has been extolled by friends and enemies. Even POPE, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tremblingly alive all o'er,"</Q> is con&s;trained to &s;queeze out the truth, which he has done in his E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m, ending with the imperfect line;
<Q><L>And what TIMOTHEUS was is DRYDEN now.</L></Q></P>
<P>The tran&s;lations and paraphra&s;es of DRYDEN, as the world knows, are numerous and valuable, but it mu&s;t be deplored that great natural talents, and &s;trong inventive faculties &s;hould be employed on &s;uch drudgery, which, according to the admitted criterion of what tran&s;lation ought to be, is a fitter ta&s;k for &s;ome moping pedant in a college; for we are told that no tran&s;lation can be perfect unle&s;s the author is rendered line by line. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A tran&s;lator,"</Q> &s;ays doctor JOHNSON,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is to be like his author; it is not his bu&s;ine&s;s to excel him."</Q>
This was a &s;ervility however that DRYDEN di&s;dained, for which he has been ridiculed by MILBOURNE, and other critics, and thanked by all men of liberality of &s;entiment, for he was the fir&s;t that came at the &s;oul of the poet and made him write in Engli&s;h, pre&s;erving all the

beauty and only exchanging the language, but with all this the world would have been more gratified if in&s;tead of tran&s;lating the epic poetry of VIRGIL, he had given us an epic poem of his own, which he me|ditated, and which would, of cour&s;e, have been a noble ornament of Engli&s;h literature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ubject on which DRYDEN intended to have written an epic poem was neither ARTHUR, or EDWARD the Black Prince The agency he intended to u&s;e in the con&s;truction of this poem, a circum|&s;tance which he con&s;idered as indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ity, was the inter|ference of the Guardian Angels of kingdoms, which tradition had warranted a belief of, and which might be u&s;ed without a&s;&s;i&s;tance from mythology or injury to religion. Nothing could be &s;o grateful to the mind as this medium. DRYDEN imparted his de&s;ign to Lord DORSFT, in his dedication of one of the Books of Juvenal, and he charged BLACKMORE with &s;tealing the plan, only &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Guardian Angels of Kingdoms were machines too ponderous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> him to manage."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Juvenal,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ius,</HI> were clearly jobs for hire; and, though the hand of a ma&s;ter is every where di&s;cernable, yet for the reputation of &s;uch a a poet as DRYDEN it were almo&s;t to be wi&s;hed they had all gone under names of his &s;ons, whom upon this occa&s;ion he u&s;hered into public notice, and who certainly tran&s;lated &s;ome of the &s;atires of Juvenal. This was not the ca&s;e, however in relation to Virgil, for, without DRYDEN's Ver&s;ion of him, ENGLAND would never, perhaps, properly have known that
<PB N="268" REF="271">
elegant poet; but the world's admiration has &s;uper|feded the nece&s;&s;ity or the po&s;&s;ibility of any thing that can be &s;aid new in prai&s;e of this elaborate and truly valuable work.</P>
<P>One thing is mo&s;t obviou&s;ly in favour of DRY|DEN in this undertaking. VIRGIL mu&s;t be of all authors the mo&s;t difficult to tran&s;late, becau&s;e his chief, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">y; is almo&s;t generally allowed, his only merit con&s;i&s;ts of his &s;tyle, and nothing can be &s;o hard as to convey mere &s;tyle from language to language. This ta&s;k was not properly &s;peaking congenial to the mind of DRYDEN. His talents came more in con|tact with tho&s;e of HOMER. They were heaven born, and full of great and intuitive beauty, rather than the beauty of mea&s;ured grace and &s;tudied re|finement. POPE &s;aid that if DRYDEN had lived to have fini&s;hed Homer he would not have attempted it after him, which argued great wi&s;dom in him; but, had they changed hands, had DRYDEN com|pleted Homer, and left Virgil to POPE. at lea&s;t the Eneid each of the&s;e writers would have been more at home. In a word, to tran&s;late Homer requires a great poet, while Virgil may be rendered by a good ver&s;ifier. DRYDEN's having, therefore, &s;o greatly &s;ucceeded as to produce a Virgil, which POPE ho|ne&s;tly declares to be the mo&s;t noble and &s;pirited
<PB N="269" REF="272">
tran&s;lation in any language, mu&s;t have &s;hewn that, great as his genius was, his judgement did not lag behind it.</P>
<P>His <HI>Fables,</HI> as they are called, which were his tran&s;lations, imitations, and paraphra&s;es from OVID, BOCCACE, CHAUCER, and others, were his la&s;t work, and from their novelty, for they were the fir&s;t attempt to render a &s;tyle of writing familiar in EN|GLAND that had made up the beauty of Italian li|terature, they were greatly and de&s;ervedly admired at fir&s;t, which admiration, upon frequent repetition, grew into fame. We will here then leave DRY|DEN as a poet. To enumerate all his merits would be as difficult as it is unnece&s;&s;ary. Every man of real ta&s;te cannot be without feeling their force. Let us therefore, while envious critics &s;narl and cavil at &s;carce faults, difficulty &s;elected from crouded beau|ties, and idly di&s;pute whether his incomparable Ode be lyric or dithyrambic, feel its charms and rejoice that it is poetry, and that it emanated from the mind of man who, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"except &s;ome human errors,"</Q> as POPE has it, enlightened and adorned the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>The works of DRYDEN, in pro&s;e, are his Dedi|cations, and Prefaces, his Controver&s;al Writings, the Lives of Plutarch, Lucian, Polybuis, and other
<PB N="270" REF="273">
things; his Dialogue on the Drama, and his Tran&s;la|tion of du Fre&s;noy's art of Painting. The&s;e, for what they are, fell in no re&s;pect &s;hort of his other productions. They are are &s;trong, full, varied, clear, and deci&s;ive. He was every where a con|&s;ummate critic, and cabable of abiding by the be&s;t te&s;t, for he could excel tho&s;e he critici&s;ed; but his general opinions are mo&s;t to be relied on, not only becau&s;e they are dive&s;ted of per&s;onality, but that they are correct and infallible, upon all which occa|&s;ions he is &s;o ea&s;y, &s;o unaffected, &s;o natural; that, though he illu&s;trates his &s;ubject by a thou&s;and ima|ges, he never entangles, or confu&s;es it.</P>
<P>This has, induced, the watchful critics to fancy that he was not very profoundly &s;tored with erudi|tion, but that from a quick preception, a large in|tercour&s;e with the world, a di&s;criminating judge|ment, and an indefatigable per&s;everence, he &s;tudied the world in&s;tead of books, and made ob&s;ervation &s;upply the place of learning. If &s;o, it were devoutly to be wi&s;hed that they would graduate in the &s;ame &s;chool; but, though this, in great mea&s;ure, is the truth, it is not wholly &s;o. DRYDEN had learning enough for any purpo&s;e, yet he had good &s;en&s;e enough to de&s;pi&s;e pedantry, and genius enough to trea&s;ure intellectual intelligence in preference to
<PB N="271" REF="274">
mere &s;chool doctrine; yet, upon a careful peru&s;al of his works altogether, it will be ea&s;ily apparent to a di&s;cerning mind; that, though there have been men of more genius, and men of more learning, the equanimity with which the&s;e qualities in him cor|rected each other, the &s;tore of ability he had to in|vent as well as to perfect, and the wonderful judge|ment with which he wrought barbarity into refine|ment, add a peculiar delight, and a valuable utility to literature, while they give his fame at once a lu&s;tre and a novelty.</P>

Doctor JOHNSON &s;ays that for &s;uch a time of life, it is uncommonly judicious; to which he curiou&s;ly adds, <Q REND="inline">"I would rather prai&s;e it than read it."</Q></P>
<P>There is nothing particular in the life of CON|GREVE except that, though a mere writer, and at that time, he contrived to get into places to the tune of twelve hundred a year, to which he added other con&s;iderable emoluments; that with all his merit he affected not to court fame; that he was affronted becau&s;e VOLTAIRE came many miles to pay his re|&s;pects to him as a man of talents; and that he left ten thou&s;and pounds to a duche&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="277">As to CONGREVE, as a writer, except having e&s;tabli&s;hed a criterion in theory for lyric poetry, which by the way had been e&s;tabli&s;hed in practi&s;e by DRYDEN, he has left nothing of any material con&s;equence but plays to be remembered by; but tho&s;e contain a &s;pecies of wit &s;o extraordinary, &s;o ingenious, and &s;o admirable, that they will ever be con&s;idered as a capital ornament to the Engli&s;h lan|guage. Their plots, however, are &s;o intricate, the dialogue is &s;o ill appropriated, and nature &s;o little con&s;idered, that though all men of nice judgment and critical di&s;cernment mu&s;t admire them, yet they never will be in general e&s;timation. They are a &s;tring of bon mots, an acted je&s;t book; but &s;uch bon mots, and &s;uch je&s;ts&mdash;&s;o neatly turned, &s;o ex|qui&s;itely witty, &s;o incomparably brilliant&mdash;that it is plain they were written with infinite pains; whereas, dialogue in comedy &s;hould &s;eem what might be ea&s;ily &s;poken. No one, however, wi&s;hes CON|GREVE had written in any other manner; for though his comedies prove that true nature&mdash;per|haps a little elevated&mdash;and &s;trict probability will ever go &s;oone&s;t to the heart, yet an acquaintance with his plays, and a judicious determination to overlook the&s;e very pardonable defects, beget in time a reli&s;h for them, which tho&s;e of no other au|thor can excite.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="278">The <HI>Old Batchelor,</HI> CONGREVE's fir&s;t play, was produced in 1693. at which time &s;ome &s;ay he was only nineteen, and others that he was twenty-one owing I &s;uppo&s;e to the difficulty of a&s;certaining where he was chri&s;tened. At either age it certainly may be con&s;idered as a wonderful performance. DRYDEN the moment he &s;aw it pronounced it the be&s;t fir&s;t attempt he had ever met with, and the world has long decided in favour of its merits. Dr. JOHNSON &s;eems to won|der how &s;uch a perfect re&s;emblance of the world and its manners could be drawn by &s;uch a boy, and then goes into an elaborate argument to prove that this is very ea&s;ily po&s;&s;ible; but it &s;o happens that there is not &s;o much truth in his argument as in his conjecture; for nothing can be a gro&s;&s;er mi&s;take than that &s;o much knowledge of human nature could have been gathered from books. The misfortune of this play is that it has too much wit, and this was &s;o confirmed afterwards that, except <HI>Love for Love,</HI> none of this author's comedies received any thing like the applau&s;e due to their merit, as writings.

<P>VANBRUGH, though his abilities were confe&s;&s;edly inferior to tho&s;e of CONGREVE, took, however as &s;urer way to &s;ucceed. He exhibited manners as as they are; and, le&s;t the complicate plots which had been accu&s;tomed to &s;urprize in&s;tead of plea&s;e Engli&s;h &s;pectators, &s;hould preclude his &s;ucce&s;s as it had the &s;ucce&s;s of CONGREVE, he &s;implified his by a clo&s;e attention to the mode of fabricating French plays. MOLIERE and DANCOURT furni&s;hed him with an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of materials, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed he made a notable u&s;e of them. It cannot be &s;aid, however, that he &s;ervilely copied them for his own mode of writing though it had little nerve, for dialogue in light comedy, was un|affecting and ea&s;y, and he had a happy facility of making his characters &s;peak correctly in nature though he kept them to a &s;ituation &s;ufficiently ele|vated to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of an author of re|putation, I remember it was remarked by the actors,
<PB N="281" REF="284">
when I was a member of the theatre, that it was ea&s;ier to &s;tudy VANBRUGH than any man who had ever written.</P>
<P>VANBRUGH, like CONGREVE, got into favour and grew opulent, but this may be attributed more to his reputation as an architect than as an author, not that his buildings in &s;tone and brick were made of &s;uch durable materials as tho&s;e fabricks he rai&s;ed upon paper; for, coming after INIGO JONES and CHRISTOPHER WREN, if any thing were to be &s;aid of his fame it would be rever&s;e of what has been al|ready quoted of AUGUSTUS. He was, however, highly thought of on this account by the great to the material benefit of his fortune and their immortal ridicule. His plays were produced in the follow|ing order:</P>
<P>The <HI>Relap&s;e,</HI> performed in 1697. This play is completely a &s;equel to CIBBER's comedy of <HI>Love's La&s;t Shift, or the Fool in Fa&s;hion,</HI> in which that great ob&s;erver, if not upon public characters, upon public writers, formed a mo&s;t admirable number of &s;triking effects from the materials of former authors, and with a laudable art and judgment managed &s;o that his play might &s;uit his acting; but he has &s;till a higher claim to commendation. He was beginning
<PB N="282" REF="285">
with great di&s;cernment and good &s;en&s;e, to reform the &s;tage without ri&s;king the danger of appearing an innovator; for nothing can be more moral than the cata&s;trophe of <HI>Love's La&s;t Shift,</HI> yet ETHERIDGE, and other di&s;&s;olute writers furni&s;hed the materials; but, though I &s;hall hereafter have plenty of op|portunity to examine this, I conceived it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;o much at pre&s;ent as there would have been an awkwardne&s;s in examining a &s;equel without no|ticing &s;omething of the &s;ubject on which it was founded.</P>
<P>If CIBBER in his play endeavoured to fa&s;hion the &s;tage into &s;omething like decency, VANBRUGH &s;eemed determined to kick down the foundation of this trembling fabric; for nothing can be more li|centious than the <HI>Relap&s;e.</HI> CIBBER brings a man to rea&s;on, to happine&s;s, and his family; but VAN|BRUGH thinks it a &s;candal to polite manners to leave him there, and therefore undoes all the prai&s;e|worthy work for which the other claims &s;o laudably to be commended; as if it was a di&s;grace to a man of the world to be honourable. There is, however a wonderful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of plea&s;antry and neatne&s;s in this play, but &s;o much the wor&s;e, for wittici&s;m is an argument in favour of vice and immorality.</P>
<P>The <HI>Provoked Wife,</HI> performed in 1697, is an|other
<PB N="283" REF="286">
play of the &s;ame licentious ca&s;t; but it abounds in &s;uch plea&s;antry and is &s;o full of natural and irre|&s;i&s;tible humour that to this moment, whenever there has been an actor capable of &s;u&s;taining the character of Sir John Brute, the public have unaccountably con&s;ented to overlook the &s;hameful and &s;candalous conduct of Lady Brute, who not only &s;eems de|lighted that her hu&s;band &s;hould give her a wordly rea&s;on for making him a cuckold, which ought to have been beyond the reach of all provocation, but is a commode and pliant in&s;trument to the &s;eduction of her niece. There are many other glaring ob|jections to this play even now; but, as it &s;tood originally, it was indeed mo&s;t &s;hockingly revolting, particularly the &s;cene where Sir John Brute di&s;|gui&s;ed him&s;elf like a clergyman the better to beat the watch and bam the ju&s;tice of peace, which &s;cene VOLTAIRE with his u&s;ual want of candour gives as a pattern of Engli&s;h comedy. As, how|ever, we have had no Sir John Brute &s;ince GAR|RICK convul&s;ed the audience with his incomparable performance of that part, it has re&s;ted ever &s;ince in perfect tranquility, and I think it is very probable that it is now in its la&s;t &s;leep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This play, and <HI>Love for Love,</HI> COLLIER mo&s;t &s;everely cen|&s;ured in his Strictures on the Stage, not with equal propriety by the by, for though it has been &s;aid, and I am afraid too truly, that what|ever wit CONGREVE might have had in his writings he had little vir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">e, yet there is le&s;s of that open unpardonable profligacy than there is in VANBRUGH, and this is proved by COLLIER's being obliged to &s;train points whenever he came to reprobate CONGREVE, whereas his reprobation was too obvious and too merited when he &s;ought for opportunities in VANBRUGH Speaking of <HI>Love for Love,</HI> he in&s;tances two &s;peeche as a ridicule of the &s;cripture, which con|&s;truction they certainly will not bear.

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you have the &s;cripture bur|le&s;qued and Samp&s;on once more brought into the hou&s;e of Dagon to make &s;port for the Phili&s;tines."</Q>
Is this any thing like truth? Not at all. Angelica cannot help laughing at the idea that an old man &s;hould have the courage to undertake a young wife and by this obvious remark, &s;o far from ridiculing the &s;cripture, &s;he only laughs at Sir Samp&s;on, who ever thinks a man irreligious, who &s;ays
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he is as poor, or as patient as Job."</Q>
Mr. COLLIER is more &s;upportable when he reprobates VANBRUGH for irreligion in introducing a rake who a&s;&s;umes the character of a clergyman, and who gets drunk and bullies the watch.</NOTE>.</P>

WILKS, however, who knew his talents, advi&s;ed him to write for the &s;tage, and in return FARQUHAR made his friend the hero of his pieces, which, however, he is &s;aid to have drawn as portraits of him&s;elf, having got a commi&s;&s;ion in the army, and being a young man greatly e&s;teemed by the gay world; young, volatile, and wild, but poli&s;hed, &s;en|&s;ible, and honourable.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="290">The exce&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility to which FARQUHAR was a &s;acrifice impeded him perhaps from con&s;ider|ing his writings &s;o maturely as he ought to have done<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Poor FARQUHAR, fearing the con&s;equences of poverty and dependence, gave out that he wi&s;hed to marry a woman of fortune.

<P>This tru&s;t WILKS faithfully fulfilled by procuring benefits for his friend's family; but this did but little, for Mrs. FARQUHAR died not long after her hu&s;band in indigent circum&s;tances, and his daughters, one of whom was alive in the year 1764, were obliged to &s;ubmit to drudgery for a maintenance.</P></NOTE>; but there is yet enough in them to &s;hew that

he had great requi&s;ites as a dramatic writer, for his plots are ingenius and original, his characters are natural and unaffected, and his manners, though common and obvious, are never trite or vulgar. Thus his comedies always give rational plea&s;ure, but &s;eldom excite &s;trong admiration; and there can be no doubt that if he had lived as independently as CONGREVE and VANBRUGH, and had not been cut off prematurely, he would have given more original proofs of his talents as a complete dramatic writer than either of tho&s;e authors; &s;ince in what he has left the management is more judicious, the nature more faithful, and the faults more venial.</P>
<P>FARQUHAR's fir&s;t play was <HI>Love and a Bottle.</HI> It came out in 1699, at which time he was twenty-one. The &s;tage at that time knew nothing but licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, and therefore he con&s;idered it as incumbent on him to draw &s;uch a character as Roebuck; which after all is much better as to nature, force, and &s;pirit than almo&s;t any thing that had then appeared, or, perhaps, that has appeared &s;ince. The &s;ucce&s;s of this play encouraged FARQUHAR to go on, and, in 1700, the Jubilee year, he produced The <HI>Con&s;tant</HI>
<PB N="289" REF="292">
<HI>Couple,</HI> which play had a run of fifty-three nights the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on, and has had almo&s;t innumerable repeti|tions. This play is &s;o well known that it is u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ay any thing here of its merits. The corro|borated determination of the public is the te&s;t of truth which has ever been and mu&s;t ever be in its favour.</P>
<P>Sir Harry Wildair is a &s;equel to the <HI>Con&s;tant Couple,</HI> and, like &s;equels in general, inferior to the original. Characters that are worked up &s;hould be let alone. In the&s;e pieces the parts were admirably performed. It is &s;aid that not even the &s;malle&s;t idea has been conveyed of Sir Harry Wildair &s;ince WILKS and NORRIS, ever after appearing in this play, was called <HI>Jubilee Dicky.</HI> The <HI>Incon&s;tant</HI> is a play of intrin&s;ic merit. It appeared in 1702. The plot is very &s;imilar to BEAUMONT and FLETCHER's <HI>Wild Goo&s;e Cha&s;e,</HI> and the circum&s;tance of the treachery again&s;t Mirabel in the hou&s;e of the Cour|tezan is &s;aid really to have happened to FARQUHAR. The characters are admirably drawn, and of this piece it may be &s;aid in common with many others, that whenever the theatre has found actors for the play, the play has always received applau&s;e from the public. The <HI>Stage Coach,</HI> produced in 1705, is a
<PB N="290" REF="293">
plea&s;ant trifle, which was performed as a farce, and in which FARQUHAR was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by MOLDEAUX.</P>
<P>The <HI>Recruiting Officer</HI> al&s;o came out in 1705, and it was written, as we are told, on the &s;pot where its author laid the &s;cene of action, who was him&s;elf at that time on a recruiting party, and therefore had an opportunity of painting his portraits from nature. In which ta&s;k he has &s;ucceeded completely as the world will bear me te&s;timony.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. ROWE, STEELE, AND MRS. CENTLIVRE.</HEAD>
<P>OF tho&s;e dramatic writers, at this period, who&s;e la|bours were celebrated in their own time, and have reached with reputation to ours, ROWE STEELE, Mrs. CENTLIVRE, and CIBBER, de&s;erve particular mention. CIBBER, however, involving in his the|atrical hi&s;tory a number of intere&s;ts, and being re|markable as well for his management as his writing and acting, &s;hall occupy the next chapter by him|&s;elf; and, in the intermediate time, we will examine the others.</P>
<P>ROWE, who&s;e dramatic reputation &s;tands merit|oriou&s;ly high with but few of the great and &s;plendid requi&s;ites, was one of tho&s;e writers who went more for delight and in&s;truction than elevation and a&s;to|ni&s;hment; a &s;pecies of merit that confers a great pub|lic obligation, &s;ince goodne&s;s, with all its beauty, is more captivating and dignified in the garb of un|affected truth than tricked out in all the frippery of
<PB N="294" REF="297">
&s;ubtilty and &s;ophi&s;try. In other words, the &s;tage was de&s;igned for all auditors, and all auditors feel and under&s;tand ROWE; perhaps not &s;o immediately as OTWAY, but the effect is more la&s;ting, becau&s;e the &s;entiment is not &s;o alluring as impre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>ROWE was, properly &s;peaking, a tragic writer, his attemps at comedy having been very weak and di&s;reputable. Like mo&s;t ma&s;ters of their art, he took liberties with his &s;ubject, fancying, probably, that an Engli&s;h author had as good a right to &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf qualified for con&s;tructing a play as a Greek critic. This has now and then offended a few fati|dious cavillers who have fallen foul of him for his frequent broaches of the unities; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that it had been better in ROWE, or even in SHAKESPEAR, if the &s;cene of action had never been interrupted during the continuation of any one act, as this violation, as doctor JOHN|SON very &s;en&s;ibly ob&s;erves, is to add more acts to the play, every act being a portion of bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted without interruption; and this, by the way, defines every play con&s;tructed by the rules of ARISTOTLE, to be a piece of one act; but let us examine his plays and we &s;hall find that, however he might have been deficient in point of regularity as a dramatic writer, he well knew the more worthy
<PB N="295" REF="298">
part of that occupation of conveying plea&s;ure and improvement.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ambitious Stepmother</HI> was brought forward in 1700. The &s;tory is evidently taken from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Solomon on the Throne,</HI> by BA|THESHEBA, ZADACK the prie&s;t, and NATHAN the prophet, the particulars of which may be &s;een in the fir&s;t Book of Kings. There is an originality and a &s;trength in the language of this play in places that ROWE never afterwards exceeded. The dialogue between Memon and Magas is de&s;ervedly cele|brated. It &s;erved for the ground work of <HI>Tamerlane and Bajazet,</HI> but boa&s;ts con&s;iderable &s;uperiority, as it is more natural and unaffected, and therefore more &s;olid and convincing. GARRICK revived this play in 1758, but it had not the &s;ucce&s;s he expected.</P>
<P><HI>Tamerlane,</HI> originally performed in 1702, is a tragedy more univer&s;ally known and celebrated by its having been written to &s;erve a temporary and popular purpo&s;e than by any &s;uperiority it has a right to claim over the other plays of ROWE. All that's moral and amiable is thrown into the character of Tamerlane, who is the repre&s;entative of King WILLIAM, all that is tyrannic and dete&s;tible is given
<PB N="296" REF="299">
to Bajazet, who &s;its for LOUIS the fourteenth; but the flattery is &s;o gro&s;s, and the &s;lander &s;o malignant, that compliment is lo&s;t in adulation, and &s;everity is blunted by the want of candour, like the white and the black &s;pirit in an Oriental Tale; one &s;o per|mits all the mi&s;chief, and the other is &s;o unable to prevent the good, the hero is alternately happy and mi&s;erable through the &s;tory, and thus, by being no more obliged to his guardian angel than his tor|mentor, the purpo&s;es of morality are defeated.</P>
<P>The public have certainly upon popular grounds greatly admired this play; and, in favour of many admirable, moral and patriotic &s;entiments it contains, have pa&s;&s;ed over the whining egoti&s;m of Tamerlane, and the empty fury of Bajazet; but the critics with more &s;en&s;e and le&s;s &s;pleen than their cu&s;tom have marked it as a catching rather than a meritorious effort of genius, calculated to &s;urprize the imagi|nation, but incapable of penetrating the mind, and gratifying the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Taken as a hi&s;torical fact, ROWE has been egree|giou&s;ly wrong; for Tamerlane, &s;o far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing refined manners and tran&s;cendant virtues, is repre|&s;ented as a barbarous and mercile&s;s conqueror, and the only contention between him and Bajazet, upon
<PB N="297" REF="300">
his principle, ought to have been who might ravage mo&s;t countries and practi&s;e the horrors of war with all its de&s;olation to the mo&s;t &s;anguinary degree of perfection. It would in this point of view, have been more ju&s;t to have imagined heroes and given them the qualities of WILLIAM, and LOUIS; but perhaps ROWE fancied the mode he took better policy, and that, when his play &s;hould have lo&s;t that part of its attraction which related to its re&s;emblance between the Engli&s;h and French monarchs, it might yet be received as a picture, whether true or fal&s;e, of the wars of Tamerlane and Bajazet.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fair Penitent,</HI> brought out in 1703, is a tra|gedy of much more con&s;equence to the reputation of an author than <HI>Tamerlane.</HI> It exhibits a dome&s;tic calamity, and one of that particular kind which is not the le&s;s affecting for being but too frequent. It is &s;o correctly in nature that if it has a fault it is that vice is repre&s;ented in too alluring a garb in Lo|thario, and that Cali&s;ta feels more anger than &s;hame, more indignation from detection than compunction from guilt. This certainly injures the intere&s;t and weakens the moral.</P>
<P>There are more radical faults in it. The play

It is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to expa|patiate on the great variety of admirable dramatic re|qui&s;ites the <HI>Fair Penitent</HI> contains, as they are felt by every heart, and confirmed by every judgement.</P>
<P>The <HI>Biter,</HI> brought out in 1705, was ROWE's only attempt at comedy; for, when he found in &s;pight of his own opinion of his piece, which went &s;o far, as we are told, as to make him expo&s;e him|&s;elf by &s;itting in the hou&s;e and laughing while the re&s;t of the audience were hi&s;&s;ing and hooting, he had the good &s;en&s;e, however he might find it laudable to ridicule biters, not to be bit afterwards him&s;elf by any perver&s;ion of his talents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ridicule of biters, or queerers, or hoaxers, or whatever title under which they may be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tingui&s;hed, was certainly very lair and has been, from ADDISON's paper in the Spectator, to the pre|&s;ent time, pretly &s;ucce&s;sfully attempted. The circum&s;tance of Rowe's laugh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ng in the mid&s;t of a groaning audience is &s;omething like a matter that happened on the French &s;tage. The author of a piece, that was highly di&s;approved, had be&s;towed orders very li|berally among his friends to &s;upport his rickety production. Seeing however that it was impo&s;&s;ible to allow any &s;hare of commendation to the piece, they, by degrees, all de&s;erted him except one; who, faithful to his promi&s;e, and yet open to conviction, was reduced at la&s;t to applaud and hi&s;s at the &s;ame time: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What is all this,"</Q> &s;aid a &s;pectator, who &s;at near him,

<P><PB N="299" REF="304"><HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> was performed in 1706, and is a tragedy, though it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es much merit in the writing not well calculated for general effect. There is &s;o much of the air of fable in tho&s;e accounts handed down to us of ancient heroes, that &s;ubjects of this nature are better calculated for opera than for tra|gedy, or comedy. If we were to take from tho&s;e innumerable poetic beauties contained in the <HI>Oly&s;&s;ey,</HI> only tho&s;e which are probable, the pieces would be too &s;terile for effect; and, if we were to violate probability, as a regular dramatic production it would be inadmi&s;&s;able. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> therefore, has ever been con&s;idered as a hetrogeneous production, con|taining poetical merit, but not enough with all the attempts that have been made to revive it, to keep a fair &s;tand on the &s;tage.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="305">The <HI>Royal Convert,</HI> a tragedy performed in 1708. This play has a con&s;iderable portion of &s;terling merit, and is never performed but it excites that kind of &s;olid prai&s;e which is highly honourable to the reputation of an author. There is, however, too much of the heavine&s;s of RACINE in it; too much turgidne&s;s; too much labour; and, as there is &s;carcely a pa&s;&s;ion it di&s;plays or incident it produces that had not been before &s;ucce&s;sfully treated and thrown into affecting &s;ituations, however it may &s;oberly intere&s;t the mind, it is not well calculated to rou&s;e the feelings.</P>
<P>ROWE certainly had great expectations from this play, and attempted to catch at popularity by imitating, in his prediction of the ble&s;&s;ings of the union, SHAKESPEAR's celebrated prophecy in <HI>Henry the Eighth,</HI> of the happy reign of ELIZABETH; but he injured the jet of this cata&s;trophe by giving it a religious turn, and his prophecies were too well an|ticipated to leave him more than the gleanings of that reputation of which SHAKESPEAR reaped &s;o fair a harve&s;t</P>
<P><HI>Jane Shore,</HI> a tragedy well known and greatly admired, and very de&s;ervedly, by every Engli&s;h auditor, was produced in 1713; and, though the
<PB N="301" REF="306">
pre&s;ent account of dramatic productions is intended to extend as nearly as po&s;&s;ible to 1708, as, except one play, it completes the career of ROWE, I &s;hall notice it in this place.</P>
<P>With &s;ome inadmi&s;&s;ible variations from the original &s;tory, this play re&s;embles a well known hi&s;|torical fact, and one of that kind which mu&s;t intere&s;t every heart. A penitent, even though an adultre&s;s, under very peculiar circum&s;tances may be forgiven, and never was forgivene&s;s excited &s;o laudably as here, but to exhibit a nece&s;&s;ary and &s;alutary warning, and to &s;hew that a woman who has violated the mar|riage bed may not, according to the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion|able definition of dramatic moral, triumph, and be happy, the poet has made heaven divide the judg|ment by giving the clemency to the hu&s;band and taking the ju&s;tice to it&s;elf, and thus JANE SHORE receives pardon and dies.</P>
<P>This play, with all its merit, and all the hold it has taken of the public, has been the &s;ubject of per|petual critici&s;m, and &s;ome of the &s;trictures of the different wits &s;eem to have breathed more a &s;pirit of envy than candour. POPE has been remarkably un|fortunate. <HI>Jane Shore,</HI> we are told, was written in imitation of SHAKESPEAR, though I dont find the
<PB N="302" REF="307">
author has admitted this, and POPE, in the Art of &s;inking in Poetry, though he afterwards wrote ROWE's epitaph, has this remark,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have &s;een a play, pro|fe&s;&s;edly written in the &s;tyle of SHAKESPEAR, wherein the re&s;emblance lay in one &s;ingle line,<Q><L>" And &s;o good <HI>morrow t'ye</HI> good ma&s;ter lieutenant."</L></Q></Q>

Now it &s;o happens that there is nothing like this in <HI>Jane Shore,</HI> the line alluded to being in <HI>Lady Jane Grey,</HI> but unfortunately for the quoter it is not cor|rectly the &s;ame, being,
<Q><L>" And &s;o good <HI>morning</HI> good ma&s;ter lieutenant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That every &s;addle may be placed on the right hor&s;e, as this remark comes from the Art of Sinking in Poetry, it is two to one again&s;t its being POPE's, for, though it has always been given to him, SWIFT and ARBUTHNOT were partners with POPE in that pro|duction; but, now we talk of hor&s;es, the fact it&s;elf has a re&s;emblance to a &s;mall mi&s;take of the notorious Mr. ASTLEY. When they were getting up a new pantomime &s;ome time ago at Covent Garden the atre, it was in contemplation, among other objects intended to re|lieve camels, elephants, and rhinocero&s;es, and calculated, as Mr. BAYES has it, to elevate and &s;urprize, to introduce &s;ome hor&s;es that had been taught, like platoon fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, to kneel, &s;toop, and &s;tand. For this purpo&s;e an emba&s;&s;y was &s;et on foot and the purport formally notified to the only manager in the world of that docile animal the hor&s;e. When this great man had correctly under&s;tood the nature of the demand, after a variety of incongruous and uninteligible exclamations, occa&s;ioned by his indignation left his hor&s;es &s;hould be di&s;graced by appearing on the &s;tage, he voci&s;erated,

<P><PB N="303" REF="308">Other critics have complained that probability is gro&s;sly violated in the breach of the unity of time, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the &s;tarving of JANE SHORE between the third and the fifth acts of the play is a &s;trange irreconcileable circum&s;tance; but we mu&s;t take the brilliant with this &s;law or we can|not have it at all, and it were pity to loo&s;e that lu&s;tre it really has by perpetually contemplating on a trifling defect. It has al&s;o been objected that there are many florid &s;peeches utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tate and &s;ituation of the di&s;tre&s;sful per&s;onages who &s;peak them, and this is &s;aid to have been the con|tinual practi&s;e of ROWE; but, to &s;hew that they are not all agreed on the &s;ubject, one doctor &s;ays that

another in&s;i&s;ts, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the interview between Jane Shore and Alicia, in the fifth act, is very affecting, and that the madne&s;s is well painted"</Q>
It hap|pens, however, fortunately for the reputation of ROWE, that this play of all others be&s;t derives its pretentions to favour from the criterion of public judgement, and it will con&s;tantly be found, when|ever
<PB N="304" REF="309">
it is ably performed, to attract crouded hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Having betrayed my&s;elf into an infringement of my plan, &s;o far as to notice Jane Shore, I &s;hall now wind up my account of ROWE by mentioning his only remaining dramatic production. <HI>Lady Jane Grey,</HI> which was performed in 1715. and was then received, and has often been repeated, with con&s;i|derable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. EDMUND SMITH, a writer of reputation, and BANKS furni&s;hed ROWE with &s;ome hints for the con&s;truction of this play, but the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory and his own judgement with more, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed there are many pa&s;&s;ages of extraordinary value to be found in it, particularly the &s;cene of Guildford and Jane Grey in the third act, the re|conciliation between Guildford and Pembroke, and the &s;cene of Jane Grey before &s;he mounts the &s;caffold.</P>
<P>Indeed were this play to be judged according to the merit of its writing, its con&s;truction, and its conduct, it is of equal excellence with any other of the tragedies of this author; but hi&s;torical &s;ub|jects have never been treated &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully as by
<PB N="305" REF="310">
SHAKESPEAR, nor was it ROWE's forte &s;o much to elevate as to intere&s;t, to pourtray public calamity as to paint private di&s;tre&s;s. Upon this ground has ROWE e&s;tabli&s;hed a reputation, highly honourable to him&s;elf, and greatly valuable to the intere&s;t of the theatre; and, in &s;pight of the high authorities by which we are taught to believe, he has no merit but the elegance of his diction and the &s;uavity of his ver&s;e, that his characters are ea&s;ily drawn, and ea&s;ily acted, that he &s;eldom moves either pity or terror, and that, though he delights the ear, he rarely pierces the brea&s;t, I appeal to the tears which are con&s;tantly &s;hed at his tragedies, and to that con|&s;equent criterion their continually holding a forward &s;ituation at the theatre, to contradict the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, and to &s;hew that, as impre&s;&s;ive as well as great actions are a forward, perhaps the be&s;t, drift of the &s;tage, &s;uch writers as ROWE and OTWAY, who, though they do not &s;tep beyond the mode&s;ty of nature in their writings, render that mode&s;ty in its mo&s;t lovely garb, have a claim to a mo&s;t elevated rank as &s;up|porters and embelli&s;hers of the drama.</P>
<P>Though, according to my plan, I cannot take up STEELE now as fully as I have taken up ROWE, yet it is proper to &s;peak of that extraordinary man
<PB N="306" REF="311">
in this place, who&s;e &s;trange private conduct, and meritorious public &s;entiments, were &s;o continually at variance.</P>
<P>There is a noble manline&s;s in independency of mind, and in every character who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it there mu&s;t naturally be much virtue; but STEELE, who certainly had this quality gave it a new turn; for his precepts and his practice were perpetually at va|riance; and, while his private conduct was tinctured with vice and profligacy, by way of a &s;et off, he transferred all the virtue to his pen. This drew him very often into unplea&s;ant &s;crapes, for it was natural to believe tho&s;e &s;entiments in&s;incere, to which his actions con&s;tantly gave the lie.</P>
<P>When he wrote the <HI>Chri&s;tian Hero,</HI> at which time he had gone into the army and cut him&s;elf off from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of an e&s;tate merely to indulge in tho&s;e profligate propen&s;ities which in that profe&s;&s;ion he might do without re&s;traint, he was of cour&s;e ri|diculed mo&s;t triumphantly; but this, &s;o far from al|tering him, only &s;timulated his mind to new exertions of the &s;ame extraordinary kind. He &s;wore in com|pany, and moralized upon paper, finned in the even|ing, and ab&s;olved him&s;elf in the morning, and &s;eemed as if he was determined intimately to know every
<PB N="307" REF="312">
&s;pecies of vice in order practically to &s;hew his fellow creatures how hideous it was, and how care|fully it ought to be avoided, and it mu&s;t be averred of him that whatever were his follies, he never pro&s;tituted his pen for the purpo&s;es of venality, or adulation.</P>
<P>As the hi&s;tory of STEELE is involved in that of the theatre it&s;elf, I &s;hall leave what I have to &s;ay of it till I relate how he came to be a patentee, and go into other circum&s;tances connected with that tran&s;action. In the mean time, as his fir&s;t three plays are within my pre&s;ent province, I &s;hall look at their re&s;pective merits.</P>
<P>The <HI>Funeral, or Grief A la Mode,</HI> was originally performed in 1602, and is a comedy of very con|&s;iderable merit. Indeed it has &s;o many &s;terling and original points that it has &s;erved to &s;upply materials for many imitators &s;ince, who&s;e flim&s;ey pretentions to public &s;avour, without this auxiliary help, would have been con&s;idered as very &s;light indeed. No|thing can e&s;tabli&s;h a better proof of the admirable merit of this play, both as a work of real invention and of true genius, than the diligence with which the critics have attempted, to no purpo&s;e, to di&s;|cover that it is not genuine; for the plot and the
<PB N="308" REF="313">
&s;tyle are unque&s;tionably the author's own, and the la&s;t is &s;o peculiar, which is, indeed the characteri&s;tic of STEELE's writings, that nothing can be more difficult to get by heart; but, when attached to the memory, nothing can be more ea&s;y to retain.</P>
<P>The outline of this play is incomparably fine, and the characters are full of variety; every thing is perfectly in nature, and the moral is complete. The be&s;t virtues are meritoriou&s;ly rewarded, and the wor&s;t vices ju&s;tly puni&s;hed. The objects held up for imitation, and dete&s;tation, are genero&s;ity, and hypo|cri&s;y, and the&s;e are recommended and decried as they branch into the circum&s;tances that call them into action, from Campley to Trim, from Lady Brumpton to the Undertaker. In &s;hort there is more merit in this play than the world has been generally inclined to allow; and, though it is never performed without great applau&s;e, it has been more admired through tho&s;e mediums, one of them in particular, where, by the introduction of other in|congruous circum&s;tances, more catching and le&s;s valuable, auditors have been cheated into admiration without the fatigue of thinking.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tender Hu&s;band,</HI> brought out in 1705, is not &s;o good a play as the <HI>Funeral,</HI> but it has many
<PB N="309" REF="314">
beauties and much truth. ADDISON, who upon all occa&s;ions manife&s;ted a warm anxiety to appear a kind of literary patron to STEELE, &s;eems to have fondly wi&s;hed the world to have &s;et down a prin|cipal part of the merit of this comedy to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; but, to a reader of di&s;cernment, nothing can be more ea&s;y than to detect this palpable fal&s;ity. The &s;tyle of the two writers is completely different, and I think there would be little difficulty in pointing out all the &s;quared, cut, mea&s;ured, and di|vided papers in the Spectator, written by ADDISON, even without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of CLIO, whereas STEELE's &s;tyle is &s;trong, and diver&s;ified; it goes di|rectly for nervous effect, without the &s;malle&s;t ap|pearance of fi&s;hing for prai&s;e. If ADDISON a&s;&s;i&s;ted him at all it was probably with his advice, and that mu&s;t have injured the play; for it is the only dra|matic production of STEELE that has a ca&s;t of that dull in&s;ipid regularity for which ADDISON has been &s;o much admired by the French.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lying Lover,</HI> performed in 1704, is cer|tainly STEELE's weake&s;t play, probably owing to the carele&s;s negligence with which it is written; for, though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed CORNEILLE's <HI>Menteur</HI> in &s;ome degree furni&s;hed the outline of it, yet it cannot be con&s;idered materially as a plagiary, be|cau&s;e the character of the Lyar is fair general game,
<PB N="310" REF="315">
and perhaps this author would have treated it better had he not lazily adopted from another in&s;tead of &s;earching for &s;omething better in his own mind, for the <HI>Menteur</HI> is not CORNEILLE's be&s;t play, nor, if it were, did he write comedy &s;o well as STEELE.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lying Lover</HI> was un&s;ucce&s;sful, and its author, in con&s;equence, in&s;tead of con&s;idering this hint as a whole&s;ome admonition, wrote no more for the &s;tage till 1709. We will, therefore, leave him to his other pur&s;uits, one of which gave the public &s;uffi|cient rea&s;on to rejoice at his indifferent &s;ucce&s;s on the &s;tage; I mean the <HI>Tatler</HI>; a work replete with a thou&s;and dramatic requi&s;ites, and which, through a perfectly original medium, taught the world to judge with preci&s;ion, ta&s;te, and elegance, on intere&s;ting yet familiar manners.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem, after what I have &s;aid of female writers, that I &s;hall find &s;ome difficulty in &s;peaking of Mrs. CENTLIVRE; for, if I allow her the merit the world has awarded her, I fal&s;ify my general opinion, and, if I do not, I de&s;ert that criterion, pub|lic di&s;crimination, which I have every where con|&s;ented to abide by.</P>
<P>I do not, however, find my&s;elf in any &s;uch pre|dicament, All I have ever &s;aid has amounted to no
<PB N="311" REF="316">
more than that when women lo&s;e that female delicacy which is their worthie&s;t de&s;ignation, and become SAPHOS in writing, they may be as well SAPHOS in every other re&s;pect; and, out of compliment to the le&s;s outrageous and more lovely part of their &s;ex, I &s;hould have no objection to di&s;tingui&s;h them at once by a neuter gender<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have often thought, on con&s;idering the well known though not very decent remark on CAESAR, alluding to the profligacy of his pa&s;&s;ions, which will occur to all cla&s;&s;ical men, that he would have made a good hu&s;band for SAPHO.</NOTE>. But I &s;ee nothing of this in Mrs. CENTLIVRE; for, though &s;he u&s;es Latin, French, and Spani&s;h, in her plays, particulars which have a&s;toni&s;hed &s;ome of her biographers, and con|vinced them that &s;he mu&s;t have been a prodigy of learning, yet, as her plots were generally borrowed from the Spani&s;h authors, through French tran&s;lators, in&s;tead of inventing, &s;he had nothing to do but to quote.</P>
<P>I will not, however, deny that many of her plays po&s;&s;e&s;s con&s;iderable merit, and I am willing al&s;o to confe&s;s that there is a tiercene&s;s in the remarks of women, when they write tolerably, for nothing more as to writing can we allow Mrs. CENTLIVRE, that often hits familiar manners with great neatne&s;s; and thus plays and letters have occa&s;ionally boa&s;ted an
<PB N="312" REF="317">
apt originality from the pens of females which have lent embelli&s;hment to literature, the be&s;t &s;pecimens of which will be found upon the whole in the plays of this lady, and the letters of Lady WORTLEY MONTAGUE. Nay, I will go further, for indeed I am fonder of prai&s;ing than of blaming, and &s;ay I have remarked a thou&s;and times among intelligent audi|ences, that the quicke&s;t and mo&s;t infallible di&s;cri|mination has made its fir&s;t appearance among the la|dies, and that their approbation has generally pointed out the very pa&s;&s;ages for which an author would naturally and worthily feel a predilection.</P>
<P>By this criterion then let Mrs. CENTLIVRE be judged. Since &s;he has ri&s;qued puerility rather than go beyond nature; &s;ince, in matters of plot and character, &s;he has generally had recour&s;e to authors of &s;terling ability, and been careful not to injure or lower the value of their merit, for whenever &s;he did this &s;he mi&s;erably deceived her&s;elf; &s;ince &s;he never attempted to &s;urprze the world with any new &s;pe|cies of logic to make it appear that four and four make nine, but was upon all occa&s;ions content with taking nature as &s;he found her, let us hone&s;tly allow the good lady, &s;ince &s;he would write, as much prai&s;e, at lea&s;t, for an attempt to exhibit men and manners without exaggeration, as candour is willing to award tho&s;e females in &s;tilts, who, through the me|dium
<PB N="313" REF="318">
of epithet, metaphor, and figure, lavi&s;hly deal out ideas and fondly fancy they are de&s;cribing the world.</P>
<P>In order to &s;ee how far her works will bear out the&s;e ob&s;ervations, without examining into the truth of whether Mrs. CENTLIVRE ran away from her mother at a tender age and cohabited at college with the celebrated ANTHONY HAMMOND, pa&s;&s;ing for a boy, or whether &s;he had any &s;tep-mother at all; whether her third hu&s;band fell in love with her as &s;he was performing Alexander the Great, or whether &s;he ever performed on the &s;tage at all; or in &s;hort whether any of the circum&s;tances relative to her are truth, in which her biographers, in their love of truth and candour, have comfortably &s;et down a &s;tring of a&s;&s;ertions as con&s;i&s;tent as tho&s;e above. I &s;hall now look into the merits of tho&s;e dramatic pieces, eight in number, which &s;he produced before 1708.</P>
<P>None of the&s;e plays are of that de&s;cription which gives the be&s;t &s;ecurity to Mrs. CENTLIVRE's repu|tation. The <HI>Perjured Hu&s;band,</HI> performed in 1700, is a tragedy, and therefore totally out of this lady's &s;tyle of writing. The theatrical propen&s;ity is ge|nerally towards tragedy at &s;tarting, whether in writing
<PB N="314" REF="319">
or in acting. Mo&s;t of the Scrubs have been origi|nally Richards, and the terror of the bowl and dag|ger has u&s;ually more attraction for inexperienced writers than the plea&s;ure of the &s;ock and the ma&s;k. Her &s;econd attempt, probably owing to the advice of &s;ome friend, was a comedy. It was called <HI>Love's Contrivance,</HI> and is little more than MOLIERE's <HI>Me|dicin Malgre Lui,</HI> which had but little effect till the &s;ubject was, as it ought to be, compre&s;&s;ed into a farce by FIELDING.</P>
<P>The <HI>Beau's Duel,</HI> 1704, is a flimzy piece which was very little noticed at fir&s;t, and is now entirely forgotten. The <HI>Stolen Heiri&s;s</HI> has the misfortune to have been plunged into &s;till darker ob&s;curity. The <HI>Game&s;ter,</HI> which came out in 1705, re&s;cued, however, the &s;ame of its author from that gloom which the foregoing puerile attempts had ca&s;t over it. It is a tran&s;lation of the <HI>Di&s;&s;ipateur</HI> of DES|TOUCHES, in which the original author, who wrote with &s;trength, is not injured, nor is the foundation, which is pretty firm, &s;haken. This comedy there|fore, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a prologue from ROWE had tolera|ble &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ba&s;&s;et Table,</HI> performed in 1706, is more bu&s;y than the <HI>Game&s;ter,</HI> but le&s;s intere&s;ting. It had
<PB N="315" REF="320">
weak pretentions to &s;ucce&s;s, and therefore could not make its way with any great advantage, e&s;pecially as the Engli&s;h audience became at this particular time good di&s;criminating judges. <HI>Love at a Venture,</HI> 1706, was not performed in the regular cour&s;e of theatrical bu&s;ine&s;s, being brought out at BATH. If it had a claim to prai&s;e that claim was never ratified by the te&s;t of an appearance on a London theatre. The <HI>Platonic Lady,</HI> brought out in 1707, is another in&s;tance of that in&s;ipidity that pervaded Mrs. CENT|LIVRE's plays till &s;he produced The <HI>Bu&s;y Body</HI>; a comedy which the actors predicted would be damned though it turned out to be one of the plea|&s;ante&s;t pieces on the &s;tage. Till the examination of that and the remainder of this lady's productions, I mu&s;t now leave this &s;ubject to look after CIBBER and bring up my account of inferior authors to 1708; after which I &s;hall go regularly on with the &s;tate of the &s;tage to GARRICK.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. CIBBER.</HEAD>
<P>AS I do not profe&s;s to be the regular biographer of tho&s;e characters which fall under my examination in the pro&s;ecution of this work, I cannot of cour&s;e &s;ay much of the chequered life of CIBBER; a life that FIELDING has whim&s;ically &s;aid he &s;eems to have lived on purpo&s;e to have an opportunity of appo|logizing for; but, as he has him&s;elf given an ample account of it in that apology, full certainly of mo&s;t ful&s;ome egoti&s;m, but neverthele&s;s richly &s;tored with intere&s;ting theatrical information, and I may with &s;trict propriety notice all that relates to the mo&s;t active part of his life, I &s;hall find plenty of oppor|tunity of blending with the public character the private man.</P>
<P>For this, however, I am not quite ripe. It would create little le&s;s than repetition to notice it here, as it &s;o completely blends it&s;elf with the &s;tate of the &s;tage onwards to GARRICK, which I &s;hall &s;hortly
<PB N="317" REF="322">
have occa&s;ion to bring up. Some few general ob|&s;ervations may notwith&s;tanding be nece&s;&s;ary, and to the&s;e at pre&s;ent I &s;hall confine my&s;elf.</P>
<P>CIBBER was perhaps, upon the whole, a cha|racter of as &s;ingular utility to the theatre as any that ever lived; for without any extraordinary inherent genius, by judgment, by art, by ingenuity, and by per&s;everance, he became eminent as an actor, as an author, and as a manager; and I think it is not dif|ficult to pronounce that, in the la&s;t capacity, GAR|RICK modelled his conduct upon CIBBER's plan.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious of the impo&s;&s;ibility of attaining repu|tation as an author by bold and genuine traits of intuitive genius, he contented him&s;elf with keeping within the mode&s;ty of nature, and what he lo&s;t on the &s;ide of fire and &s;pirit, he by this means gained on the &s;ide of truth and morality. Thus when the <HI>Anathema</HI> of COLLIER was fulminated again&s;t tho&s;e oaks DRYDEN, CONGREVE, and the re&s;t, CIBBER kept him&s;elf as inoffen&s;ive and &s;ecure as that laurel with which he was afterwards &s;o harmle&s;sly adorned.</P>
<P>When RICH and his partners were pulling and tugging at the theatrical bone till they had made it all over mud without &s;atisfying their hunger, CIB|BER
<PB N="318" REF="323">
watched their motions; and, finding at length where it had been hid, with true &s;agacity appro|priated it to him&s;elf He &s;aw the certain con&s;e|quences of tho&s;e contentions which had convul&s;ed the theatrical &s;tate, he had him&s;elf been an advocate for morality, he therefore applied every &s;en&s;ible and effectual remedy to cure tho&s;e evils, and at a time too when they had grown to the mo&s;t alarming height. He &s;aw that conciliation, and not perver&s;ene&s;s ho|ne&s;ty and not chicanery, were the only means to &s;ave the &s;tage; and the&s;e whether from principle or intere&s;t it does not alter the argument, he fairly and judiciou&s;ly applied; and, that his a&s;&s;ociates might cordially co operate with his mea&s;ures, he, like RANDOLPH's Colax, &s;o accommodated him&s;elf to their &s;eparate tempers that he not only, whenever any di&s;pute aro&s;e, reconciled them to one another, but him&s;elf to both.</P>
<P>As an actor he had a more difficult ta&s;k to per|form; but to him ob&s;tacles were incentives. Na|ture, even according to his own account, with all his egoti&s;m, had denied him almo&s;t every theatrical re|q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">te; yet he found a &s;ub&s;titute for all, and made &s;tudy, perfectne&s;s, and judgement, arre&s;t as much the attention of the public as others did truth, ele|gance, and nature.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="324">It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed there are always characters enough in which this &s;tyle of acting may be exer|ci&s;ed with effect; and, to help this, he introduced his Lord Foppington, a part which was certainly a happy hit at extravagant and ridiculous folly. In &s;hort, uniting the&s;e three capacities in him&s;elf, he &s;o made his abilities in one department &s;ub&s;ervient to the re&s;t; that, keeping the real intere&s;t of the theatre in view upon the broad principle of its &s;erving the purpo&s;e of morality, it cannot be denied that he mu&s;t be con&s;idered as meritoriou&s;ly eminent in all his departments.</P>
<P>This will as I go on be gradually made out, in the mean time let us examine his plays up to 1708.</P>
<P><HI>Love's La&s;t Shift,</HI> which was performed in 1696, and which I have already been compelled to &s;peak of in my account of The <HI>Relap&s;e.</HI> does is author infinite credit. CIBBER had that &s;ort of predilection for the &s;tage which no arguments, no di&s;courage|ment, no di&s;appointment however mortifying, could re&s;train. In &s;pight of his &s;urprizing the actors and the town into a conviction that, however he might be unqualified by nature for an actor, he found &s;o perfect a re&s;ource in his good &s;en&s;e and his di&s;cri|mination as to &s;urmount all difficulties and plea&s;e by
<PB N="320" REF="325">
an appeal, if not to the &s;en&s;es, at lea&s;t to the under|&s;tandings of his audience; I &s;ay, in &s;pight of this, his companions would not by any means allow his claim to any rank in his profe&s;&s;ion, and they even connived at his ruin, when an unexpected occa&s;ion put the part of Fondlewife into his hands in CON|GREVE's play of the <HI>Old Bachelor.</HI> Their words were,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If the fool has a mind to blow him&s;elf up at once, let us even give him a clear &s;tage for it."</Q></P>
<P>Knowing completely thus circum&s;tanced what to do, and finding that while POWELL was imitating BETTERTON, he &s;hould gain upon the public by imitating DOGGET, he continued to get &s;o &s;trong a hold of their favour that it was decided from that moment that though he was a peculiar actor he had certainly con&s;iderable merit. The difficulties how|ever thrown in his way by his brethren were not ea&s;y to &s;urmount, e&s;pecially as they &s;o far had rea&s;on on their &s;ide as to object to acting which derived all its effect from labour and art.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e ob&s;tacles which repre|&s;ented that there was no character already written in his way he was compelled to write a character for him&s;elf, and to all the&s;e circum&s;tances CIBBER cer|tainly had great obligations. Indeed when an en|vied
<PB N="321" REF="326">
public man is &s;timulated to &s;tretch his genius and put out its &s;trength at all points to manife&s;t its excellence and power he is generally the better for it as long as he lives, for he &s;urprizes him&s;elf into a conviction of latent merit which he little &s;u&s;pected he ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which perhaps would never have &s;hewn it&s;elf had it not been by &s;uch ad|ventitious circum&s;tances called &s;o forcibly into action.</P>
<P>Wound up to the nece&s;&s;ity of providing for his reputation as an actor, and bound more &s;eriou&s;ly to beware that in the added capacity of author he did not experience a irreparable fall, more than com|mon exertion became indi&s;pen&s;ibly requi&s;ite; he, therefore, worked him&s;elf up to the proper pitch and &s;tampt a reputation in both lights, which was never afterwards denied him. The great trait of <HI>Love's La&s;t Shift</HI> is the moral foundation on which, with con&s;ummate good &s;en&s;e, e&s;pecially con&s;idering the time when it was written, CIBBER con&s;tructed this play, and which, in &s;pight of the unnatural, and in|deed impo&s;&s;ible circum&s;tance of a man's making love to his wife and not knowing her, obtained for it a permanent reputation. It might however ea&s;ily have been perfect. Mrs. Lovele&s;s might have pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="322" REF="327">
for a foreign Courtizan, which would have been a complete di&s;gui&s;e and have thrown a out better lure. It mu&s;t however be allowed, and time has proved the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion, that <HI>Love's La&s;t Shift</HI> is a play of that judicious kind by which the intere&s;t of the &s;tage is be&s;t promoted.</P>
<P>As a proof that CIBBER was obliged to mu&s;ter the whole &s;trength of his be&s;t exertions in the pro|duction of his fir&s;t play, he appears to have &s;o ex|hau&s;ted him&s;elf that it was a long time before he re|pleni&s;hed his mind with a good &s;tock of materials; for <HI>Woman's Wit,</HI> brought out in 1697, except that part of it which he wrought into a farce called The <HI>School Boy,</HI> and which after all was not original, is a very poor bu&s;ine&s;s indeed. <HI>Xerxes,</HI> a tragedy, pro|duced in 1699, is &s;till le&s;s worthy of mention. It was damned the fir&s;t night, which STEELE notices in his Theatrical Inventory in the <HI>Tatler.</HI> one article of which is
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The imperial robes of Xerxes never worne but once."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Love makes a Man,</HI> however, made CIBBER's reputation; for it e&s;tabli&s;hed him in all opinions as a judicious and &s;en&s;ible dramatic writer. It was per|formed in 1700, and is evidently taken in many places from the <HI>Cu&s;tom of the Country,</HI> and the
<PB N="323" REF="328">
<HI>Elder Brother,</HI> of BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, or rather from the &s;ource whence tho&s;e authors drew their materials for their plays. It is, however, in|finitely beyond every thing that has been done upon the &s;ubject; and if it only boa&s;ted the hu|mourous contra&s;t between Clodio and Don Cho|lerick, it is impo&s;&s;ible, for &s;tage effect, to be car|ried to a greater degree of perfection. It is per|fectly alive and diverting, and will ever be a fa|vourite, for whatever mirth it affords us we &s;hall never repent of upon reflection.</P>
<P>CIBBER's next attempt was an alteration of SHAKESPEAR's <HI>Richard the Third,</HI> in which he mani|fe&s;ted much judgement, and indeed much mode&s;ty; for, plainly feeling him&s;elf unequal to follow the &s;tyle of his great original, he re&s;tored pa&s;&s;ages from SHAKESPEAR's other plays to fill up the cha&s;ms he found it nece&s;&s;ary to make in properly adapting it to the &s;tage. There were no doubt, with all its ad|mirable merit, many tedious and trifling parts in the original play, which cooled the intere&s;t of the dif|ferent &s;cenes; by this judicious alteration the events follow with more rapidity, and are indeed more af|fecting, and it cannot be denied that the &s;terling merits of SHAKESPEAR in this wonderful play are rendered more brilliant by the poli&s;h they have re|ceived
<PB N="324" REF="329">
from CIBBER, who&s;e &s;ole care has been, by rubbing off the du&s;t of time, to di&s;play its lu&s;tre to greater advantage.</P>
<P><HI>She Would and She Would Not,</HI> performed in 1703, and derived from a Spani&s;h &s;ource, is a play full of plea&s;antry, whim, and intere&s;t. Don Manual and Tripanti, are drawn in a bold and ma&s;terly man|ner, and tho&s;e ladies who have determined in their fir&s;t appearance to &s;port as much as po&s;&s;ible their per&s;onal charms, have generally cho&s;en Hypolita by way of debut. This comedy has been, probably, ever &s;ince it was written on the &s;tock li&s;t, and will ever continue &s;o; &s;ubject, however, more or le&s;s to repetition in proportion as actors are found to &s;up|port the characters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carele&s;s Hu&s;band,</HI> which came out the fol|lowing year, is a very extraordinary play. The The plot is &s;lender the intere&s;t is familiar, and the characters are of that de&s;cription which in general create the lea&s;t anxiety in an audience. It has no po&s;itively comic incidents nor per&s;onages to chequer and break the chain of circum&s;tances, which the au|thor has cho&s;en from common events in high life. It profe&s;&s;es to delineate no more than elegant man|ners, a picture in general of all others the mo&s;t pal|ling
<PB N="325" REF="330">
and vapid, and yet has he thrown a peculiar grace and clevation into his play; that, though it con&s;i&s;ts of but &s;even characters, two or three of which are perpetually before you, it continually ex|cites and gratifies every laudable curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>It was the fa&s;hion for CONGREVE and others to &s;ay of CIBBER that his plays had in them only a great many things that were like wit, but that in re|ality were not wit; but this was only glo&s;&s;ing over that di&s;appointment they felt them&s;elves, CON|GREVE in particular, at finding the productions of this author preferred to theirs. CIBBER, by a clo&s;e attention to the be&s;t merits of them all, and a care|ful determination to &s;hun their errors, &s;teered a &s;ort of middle cour&s;e that brought him to his mark more expeditiou&s;ly and more &s;ecurely than they, with all their genius, arrived at theirs. To this he added a pe|cular excellence of his own, and this was a happy knack of penning the common conver&s;ation, a little elevated perhaps, of elegant and courtly cha|racters; by which means he united all the e&s;&s;ence of ETHERIDGE, SEDLEY, and that &s;et, adopting the wit and &s;hunning the profligacy, and with won|derful felicity blended levity and honour, and reg|ulated the freedom of CHARLES, by the morality of WILLIAM.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="331">Thus was the merit of The <HI>Carele&s;s Hu&s;band</HI> ta&s;ted in a double &s;en&s;e. It was a &s;chool for ele|gant manners, and an example for honourable ac|tions. The frailty of human nature was well ex|po&s;ed, and well attoned for; and per&s;onages in high and exalted &s;tations were made to feel them&s;elves dignified by the exerci&s;e of that honour which re&s;ults from conviction and reflection at the &s;ame time that their manners were courtly, and their conver&s;ation edifying.</P>
<P>Indeed this peculiar excellence in CIBBER, which had &s;omething &s;o like wit that it an&s;wered his purpo&s;e full as well as if it had really been &s;o, conjured up another kind of &s;lander which has been almo&s;t con&s;tantly, by the envious and malig|nant, charged upon that merit they want the ability to imitate. It was mo&s;t curiou&s;ly found out that CIBBER was not the author of his own works, and thus the productions that POPE afterwards con&s;igned to eternal oblivion for their dullne&s;s, acknowledg|ing them to be CIBBER's, were, in the zenith of their reputation denied to be his on account of their extraordinary merit.</P>
<P><HI>Perolla and Izadora,</HI> a tragedy, was produced by CIBBER in 1706, and like the re&s;t of his plays of
<PB N="327" REF="332">
this de&s;cription was very &s;oon laid by. It &s;hould &s;eem that he wrote this piece in compliment to lord ORRERY, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he acknowledges in his preface to have received, and to which he mo|de&s;tly attributes even its very &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s, for it was performed but &s;ix times.</P>
<P>The <HI>School Boy</HI> is a very plea&s;ant farce, and was altered by CIBBER from his comedy of <HI>Woman's Wit.</HI> The <HI>Comical Lovers,</HI> 1707, is a ha&s;ty alteration of DRYDEN's <HI>Maiden Queen,</HI> and <HI>Marriage ala Mode.</HI> It however was well received and has been &s;ome|times repeated, but never with any marked &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Double Gallant</HI> is a much better play. It came out the &s;ame year. It was &s;everely treated when it made its original appearance; but, upon be|ing revived about two years afterwards, it became a great favourite, and has &s;o continued to this day. There are certainly many admirable &s;cenes and &s;ituations in it; and, though a re&s;emblance of Atall may be found in twenty different Spani&s;h plays, CIBBER has managed both that and many other things with adroitne&s;s and judgement.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lady's La&s;t Stake,</HI> brought out in 1708, is again a play of great merit, but CIBBER had by this
<PB N="328" REF="333">
time refined rather too much upon fa&s;hionable man|ners, and it began to be evident that the &s;tage wanted &s;omething more to &s;upport it than high life, which by the way is not always natural life, and that mere elegance for want of contra&s;t became vapid. This &s;eems to have been CIBBER's opinion, for he imme|diately after this brought out pieces more diver&s;ified; but the&s;e, not being within my pre&s;ent pur&s;uit, I &s;hall leave them till I have brought up other authors to 1708, after which we &s;hall go through the whole conduct of CIBBER in quality of manager, a &s;ituation which he filled with great credit to him&s;elf, and ad|vantage to the cau&s;e of the theatre.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. SOUTHERN, MRS. PIX, MRS. MANLEY, MRS. COCK|BURNE, LORD LANDSDOWNE, DENNIS, OLDMIXON, MOTTEAUX, AND GILDON.</HEAD>
<P>RATHER than make three eras in my account of SOUTHERN, for he produced plays before the Re|volution, in the interval between that event and 1708, and afterwards as far on as 1726, I have ne|glected him &s;o far in order to bring as much of him as po&s;&s;ible into one point of view.</P>
<P>SOUTHERN was a poet of extraordinary value, but his writings have two characters, which he &s;eems to have been con&s;cious of to his &s;hame; for, know|ing how much more the world is caught with fri|volity than rea&s;on, he divided his reputation in two, and wrote ribaldry and licentiou&s;ne&s;s for the public, and beauty and nature for him&s;elf. This he pathe|tically lamented to lord CORK, but he &s;eems to have
<PB N="340" REF="335">
forgot to mention that what he did was to comply with every whim, however ab&s;urd and derogatory, for intere&s;t; for it is notorious that SOUTHERN con|trived to get con&s;iderably a better recompence for his labours than any author of his time; and, as a proof of this, though he produced few pieces during a very long life, he died the riche&s;t of the dramatic poets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fact is that there was nothing to which SOUTHERN did not conde&s;cend to get money for his plays. By one of them he is &s;aid to have cleared, be&s;ides the wages of his flattery, which were con&s;iderable, &s;even hundred pounds, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">quire which &s;um DRYDEN at the &s;ame time was obliged to write &s;even plays. This is averred as a fact, and that DRYDEN, who was &s;ometimes mean him&s;elf, by the bye, reprobated him for his meanne&s;s.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His conduct will be in &s;ome degree developed in an account of his plays, and therefore we will proceed with tho&s;e. The <HI>Loyal Brother</HI> was pro|duced in 1682, at a time when the tory intere&s;t was uppermo&s;t, and SOUTHERN did not therefore fail to compliment, for reward, King JAMES, then Duke of YORK. He was, however, very little rewarded by public applau&s;e, for the <HI>Loyal Brother</HI> had but indifferent &s;ucce&s;s on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Di&s;appointment</HI> was SOUTHERN's fir&s;t co|medy. It was performed in 1684, and had tem|porary
<PB N="345" REF="336">
&s;ucce&s;s, but it is full of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and therefore died with the age that produced it. <HI>Sir Anthony Love,</HI> 1691, is a comedy &s;till licentious, but of a better ca&s;t. It had very great &s;ucce&s;s, and is one of tho&s;e for which he got &s;o well paid. The <HI>Wives' Excu&s;e,</HI> 1692, is probably SOUTHERN's be&s;t comedy. It is much more endurable, as to its dia|logue, than his other comedies, and the conduct has more of the right &s;ort of intere&s;t; but it is far from being a good play. The <HI>Maid's La&s;t Prayer,</HI> 1693, has &s;o much merit as that it &s;erved for the &s;ubject of of a &s;ong written by CONGREVE.</P>
<P>SOUTHERN's next play, The <HI>Fatal Marriage,</HI> however redeemed his reputation with the judicious, who certainly before had only a &s;u&s;picion of his be|ing a good writer. Here their &s;u&s;picions were well confirmed, and they had only to lament that he &s;hould couple &s;o much beautiful writing with &s;o much contemptible tra&s;h. It was brought out in 1694, and continued in the hetrogeneous &s;tate of a tragi comedy till GARRICK very judiciou&s;ly &s;e|perated the farcical part from the pathetic, the latter of which is mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ively natural, and brought it out &s;upported by him&s;elf and Mrs. CIBBER. Since which it has been a known and acknowledged favourite of the theatre, and it certainly contains
<PB N="342" REF="337">
many happy pa&s;&s;ages which, for equi&s;ite power over the heart, are perhaps not to be equalled unle&s;s in <HI>Oronooko.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oronooko,</HI> a play, as far as it relates to the tragic part, full of beauty, truth, and nature, was produced in 1690. The critics, and indeed the world have loudly complained, and with rea&s;on of the ribaldry and frivilous &s;tuff put into the mouths of the plan|ters; but it is extremely difficult to know what to do with the&s;e biforms, for the circulation belongs every where; and, though it is ea&s;y to cut off the deformity, there is always a danger of wounding &s;ome vital part. This has been clearly proved by the various attempts at an alteration of this play, one of which, that made by HAWKESWORTH, is very re&s;pectable. If, neverthele&s;s, &s;ome writer of con&s;iderable ability were to perfect, or rather enlarge, the &s;tory by &s;uch dramatic requi&s;ites as are congenial to it, the pains would be well repaid by the reputation that would re&s;ult from it; for it has nature &s;o correctly true, tenderne&s;s &s;o exqui|&s;itely touching, and &s;entiment &s;o nobly dignified, that, if SOUTHERN had left behind him nothing more than the &s;cenes between Oronooko and Imo|inda, they would have compo&s;ed a gem, &s;mall in|deed, but ine&s;timable.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="338">The <HI>Fate of Capua,</HI> a tragedy, 1700, is an at|tempt by SOUTHERN in another way, for it is full of politics. In &s;hort it is written with an eye to bu&s;ine&s;s, and the author has not been &s;paring of that flattery for which no doubt he was hand&s;omely paid. The dome&s;tic &s;cenes, however, are full of beauty and intere&s;t, but by no means &s;o valuable as tho&s;e in <HI>Oronooko,</HI> or even in <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> SOUTHERN brought out nothing after this play till 1719.</P>
<P>Mrs. PIX, Mrs. MANLEY, and Mrs. TROTTER, alias COCKBURNE, made up a triumvirate of Lady wits who enjoyed a great deal of the admiration of the namby pamby critics, and the indifference, and &s;ometimes the ridicule of tho&s;e whom heaven had vouch&s;afed to endow with ta&s;te and judgement.</P>
<P>Mrs. PIX wrote nine dramatic pieces. The fir&s;t a farce, 1696, was called The <HI>Spani&s;h Wives.</HI> It is entirely borrowed, and, after a few nights, was re|turned to the owner. <HI>Ibrahim the Twelfth,</HI> &s;ame year, is a tragedy, and the warme&s;t advocate that I can find for it only allows that it is not contemptible. The <HI>Innocent Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> a comedy, 1697, borrowed from Sir GEORGE ERHERIDGE's <HI>Man of Mede,</HI> is much inferior to the original, and therefore very &s;oon got out of fa&s;hion. The <HI>Deceiver Deceived,</HI> a comedy, 1698, was helped forward by DUFREY
<PB N="344" REF="339">
and MOTTEAUX, but ineffectually, for it had no &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Queen Catherine,</HI> a tragedy, &s;ame year, reigned a very &s;hort time; for, in &s;pight of the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of all the triumvirate, and particularly a pro|logue from Mrs. TROTTER, &s;he abdicated her throne in about four nights.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fal&s;e Friend,</HI> a tragedy, 1699, has not found a &s;ingle advocate among all the panegyri&s;ts of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s. PIX, therefore we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e it played her fal&s;e as well as others. The <HI>Czar of Mu&s;covy,</HI> 1701. Here Mrs. PIX was determined to do the thing at once and introduce PETER the Great upon the Engli&s;h &s;tage. The emperor, how|ever, though at that time he was playing a con&s;pi|cuous part on the theatre of the world, was &s;curvily handled, and forced, in &s;pight of all his former vic|tories, to a precipitate retreat. The <HI>Double Di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> a tragedy, was as &s;curvily treated as the <HI>Czar Peter,</HI> and in the &s;ame year. Mrs. PIX went as far as <HI>Per|&s;epol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> for her plot; but, whether &s;he lo&s;t it in her way back again, or in whatever manner &s;he managed to convey it to her audience, for I believe &s;he had but one, it was the univer&s;al opinion that &s;he had been wool gathering.</P>
<P>With The <HI>Conque&s;t of Spain</HI> we &s;hall take leave of Mrs. PIX, of which play we have as few parti|culars
<PB N="345" REF="340">
as of the re&s;t. Indeed it &s;hould &s;eem as if all her productions had been foi&s;ted on the public through the medium of connexions; and, j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> as we have frequently &s;een in the productions of lady writings, they became of &s;ort of fa&s;hion of the ephe|meron kind, but were too &s;light to be permanent.</P>
<P>Of Mrs. MANLEY a great deal has been &s;aid, and the ob&s;ervation which has continually occurred to me in the accounts of biographers in general, who, out of tenderne&s;s to their heroes and heroines, attribute to them all kinds of vices which they pre|tend to qualify into misfortune obtains here very particularly. Mrs. MANLEY was picked into a fal&s;e marriage, was fal&s;ely accu&s;ed by the Duche&s;s of CLEVELAND of intriguing with her &s;on, and by injuries and unworthy ill treatment was driven to conduct which all the world mu&s;t confe&s;s was &s;hamefully reprehen&s;ible. All this is ridiculous.</P>
<P>Mrs. MANLEY was a woman of turbulent and ungovernable &s;pirit; who, fancying &s;he could write, was determined to rule. She wrote a thing in four volumes, where &s;he is &s;everely &s;atirical, without meaning or motive, as well on her own &s;ex as all the re&s;t of the world; while &s;he her&s;elf de&s;erves uni|ver&s;al dete&s;tation for her own wanton and lacivious
<PB N="346" REF="341">
de&s;criptions in the very work in which &s;he affects to admoni&s;h others. This work would never have ren|dered her popular but for the folly of the mini&s;ters of that time, who were &s;tupid enough to fancy this mad production a &s;atire on the friends of the Re|volution.</P>
<P>A warrant was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t her with all imagi|nable &s;olemnity, &s;he was denied the u&s;e of pen, ink, and paper, and treated as a per&s;on dangerous to the &s;tate; whereas her offence was only again&s;t common &s;en&s;e, in which, indeed, her accu&s;ers &s;eemed deter|mined to be even with her. After lord SUNDER|LAND, however, had made him&s;elf ridiculous enough by per&s;onating the principal character in this &s;illy farce he was contented to take all the reproach to him&s;elf, and give all the popularity to her by di&s;|charging her, as he had retained her, without be|ing able to give a rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try &s;oon after this changed, and an|other &s;et came in, who treated her more kindly but more ridiculou&s;ly than the former, for &s;he was im|mediately invited by them to become their partizan; nay, &s;he is &s;aid to have continued the <HI>Examiner</HI> after SWIFT left it off. But the&s;e traits are &s;ufficient to &s;hew the folly of tho&s;e who encourage females to
<PB N="347" REF="342">
depart from the only &s;pere they can adorn, by flatter|ing them that they po&s;&s;e&s;s talents which, were it true, cannot render them amiable if diverted from their appropriate u&s;e.</P>
<P>Her plays were produced in the following order. The <HI>Royal Mi&s;chief,</HI> a tragedy, performed in 1696, in &s;pight of her admirers, who find that the allegories are ju&s;t the metaphors beautiful, and that the rules are correctly ob&s;erved according to ARISTOTLE, is a very extravagant &s;tupid thing, which owed the little applau&s;e it received to her popularity, ob|tained as we have &s;een above, and which &s;oon &s;unk into nothing. The <HI>Lo&s;t Lover</HI> is a comedy. It was brought out in the &s;ame year and had bad &s;ucce&s;s, though Mrs. MANLEY's panegyri&s;ts tell us the dia|logue was genteel, and the incidents intere&s;ting.</P>
<P><HI>Almyna</HI> was the next production of this lady and a tragedy. It was produced in 1707, and is an en|deavour to &s;hew not what heroic virtue naturally is but what it ought to attempt. In &s;hort it is as ex|travagant as the &s;ource that produced it; being an ingenious mixture of <HI>Caliph Valid Almanzor,</HI> the <HI>Arabian Nights,</HI> and DENNIS's <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Operas.</HI> As there remains but one more production of this female
<PB N="348" REF="343">
theatrical Quixote, and I am unwilling to re&s;ume the &s;ubject, I &s;hall now &s;peak of it even though it was not produced till the year 1717. It was called <HI>Lucius, the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian King of Britain,</HI> and dedi|cated to STEELE, whom &s;he had formerly abu&s;ed, and who &s;o good naturedly pa&s;&s;ed by her folly as to write a prologue for her, and prevail upon PRIOR to write a epilogue, with all which a&s;&s;i&s;tance, how|ever, it had very little &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. TROTTER, or rather Mrs. COCKBURNE, whom her biographers prai&s;e for her knowledge in the Latin grammer and logic, for embracing the Romi&s;h communion upon conviction, for her vying in metaphy&s;ics with LOCKE, for her love of her hu&s;band becau&s;e he wrote an account of the Mo&s;iac deluge, for her &s;mall &s;tature and lively eye, pro|duced five plays.</P>
<P><HI>Agnes de Ca&s;tro,</HI> a tragedy, made its appearance in 1696. It had been before treated by Mrs. BEHN, with whom this lady had better have let it re&s;t, for it procured her neither profit nor prai&s;e, except that part of it, &s;ays an author, an Iri&s;hman probably, which contained a copy of ver&s;es to Mr. CONGREVE on his <HI>Mourning Bride.</HI> Her tragedy called <HI>Fatal Friend&s;hip,</HI> which came out in 1698, had better &s;uc|ce&s;s,
<PB N="349" REF="344">
and was reprinted in her works which were publi&s;hed in 1751 by Dr. BIRCH. The warme&s;t advocate, however, of this lady only &s;ays it was the mo&s;t perfect of her dramatic pieces.</P>
<P>The <HI>Unhappy Penitent,</HI> a tragedy, 1701, has not le&s;t a &s;ingle trace of its fate, &s;o that we know not whether it was good, bad, or indifferent. <HI>Love at a Lo&s;s,</HI> &s;ame year, I am almo&s;t as much at a lo&s;s to give an account of. The writers lay its bad &s;ucce&s;s to its having being printed very incorrectly, an error certainly, but not of &s;uch magnitude as materially to affect the reputation of any production. but at any rate we cannot admit it here right or wrong, for the piece was called in and correctly printed, after which it was performed with as little &s;ucce&s;s as be|fore. One more play brings us to the end of this lady's labours. It was called The <HI>Revolution of Sweden,</HI> and performed in 1706; but, anxious as they have been to relate the particulars of Mrs. TROTTER's life as her biographers have trod very ten|derly, on the ground of her theatrical reputation, we &s;hall imitate them and pa&s;s by this tragedy without &s;peaking of its &s;ucce&s;s. As to its intrin&s;ic merit, tho&s;e who can procure her works and chu&s;e to take the trouble of reading it, will not find enough en|tertainment to requite them for their curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="345">Lord LANDSDOWNE was rather an elegant than a great writer; he felt in him&s;elf what was due to di&s;tingui&s;hed talents, and had the &s;pirit and ju&s;tice to encourage them in others. This heaped on him of cour&s;e the unqualified prai&s;e of the poets, which both DRYDEN and POPE dealt out pretty profu&s;ely; &s;o much &s;o, that, were we to take the merit of his poetry from their report of it, we &s;hould conceive him to have been a writer of unequalled abilities, whereas his delight was to imitate the manner of other authors even to the copying of their imper|fections, and thus his works became a farago of the &s;tyle of other writings without having any de|cided character of their own.</P>
<P>The particular merits of his poems, which are generally occa&s;ional, and imitations of WALLER, of whom he was an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer, I cannot have room to give an account of. Some of them are in the mouths of tho&s;e who&s;e ears are more tickled with rhime than poetry. His plays, though far from perfect, are his be&s;t productions.</P>
<P>The <HI>She Gallants,</HI> a comedy, 1696, has been highly &s;poken of and certainly had &s;ucce&s;s, till &s;ome party people taking it into their heads that it was in|tended as a reflection on the government, which was
<PB N="351" REF="346">
impo&s;&s;ible, for it had been written twelve years be|fore it appeared, when the author was a boy, and when the features of governing bore a different re|&s;emblance, it was &s;everely handled. In &s;ober judg|ment this play cannot be greatly prai&s;ed; for, though it has wit and &s;atire, or rather &s;everity and fine&s;&s;e; yet, as the author piqued him&s;elf upon having kept the &s;cene con&s;tant to one place, and the action en|tire, rather a cold recommendation of a lively co|medy, and as one mark of it, not a very advantageous one, is an imitation of WYCHERLEY's ob&s;cenity it is not unlikely that the partizans, who put a violent end to its exi&s;tance, only prevented it from dying a natural death.</P>

was to correct the mon&s;trous extravagance intro|duced at that time into operas by &s;omething more naturally gratifying to the &s;en&s;es.

<P>DENNIS, who was di&s;tingui&s;hed more as a critic than as a dramatic writer has, however, le&s;t us nine pieces of different de&s;criptions. This author lived in a &s;tate of warfare with all mankind, and in par|ticular with the poets. ADDISON, STEELE, and even POPE, would have been friends to him but he completely put it out of their power by treating them with the ranke&s;t ingratitude, and he pa&s;&s;ed on to old age through a life of turbulence, petulance, and indigence, de&s;pi&s;ed by every body from prin|ciple, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by every body from pity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DeNNIS boa&s;ted that though POPE had abu&s;ed bim in the Dunciad, he would compel him to attone for it. Being a&s;ked how, he &s;aid he pretty well knew the vanity of the little gentleman, and would, therefore, &s;olicit him to write a prologue to a play that, be|ing in extreme poverty, he intended to get acted for his benefit, and that he was &s;ure, notwith&s;tanding their mutual enmity, the reputation of appearing charitable would readily induce him to undertake it. He was not deceived. POPE con&s;ented, and the play, thus &s;trength|ened, produced a good hou&s;e, while the virtue of forgivene&s;s of ene|mies was loudly chanted to POPE's honour.

It is too ridiculous to go into the merit of a thing that was profe&s;&s;edly written to amend a piece already perfect. <HI>Liberty A&s;&s;erted.</HI> The &s;ucce&s;s of this piece, which was brought out in 1704, almo&s;t turned poor DENNIS's brain. He be|gan to conceive him&s;elf an object of the utmo&s;t im|portance; and, becau&s;e in the plot, which repre&s;ents the wars carried on among the Indian nations, there was a re&s;emblance to the &s;ituation of ENGLAND and FRANCE, and he had thrown in a number of hackneyed compliments on the government of this country at the expence of our neighbours, he con|&s;idered him&s;elf, and procured him&s;elf to be con&s;i|dered, which kind of matters are very ea&s;ily managed, as of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the nation.</P>
<P>Puffed up by this adventitious favour, which pro|ceeded in him from &s;entiments neither dutiful nor &s;incere, but were merely a catch for popularity, his vanity carried him to the mo&s;t ridiculous height.
<PB N="356" REF="351">
He went &s;o far as to fancy his play had done &s;o much injury to the French nation that the king of FRANCE would never con&s;ent to a peace without in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">ng upon his being given up as a preliminary article. Nay, full of this he even applied to the duke of MARLBOROUGH for his intere&s;t to avert this dreadful con&s;equence of his patrioti&s;m, who very coolly told him to be perfectly ea&s;y, for that he had endeavoured to do the French as much mi&s;chief as po&s;&s;ible and he had not found it nece&s;|&s;ary to conclude him&s;elf in the treaty.</P>
<P>Many other circum&s;tances are related of this vain and credulous man; who, becau&s;e he had done his duty by accident, or rather through intere&s;ts, fondly fancied rewards and favours out of all mea|&s;ure were due to him, when thou&s;ands, from prin|ciple, were &s;incerely labouring for the intere&s;t and agrandizement of their country without the view or the expectation of any further reward than the plea|&s;ure re&s;ulting from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having ho|nourably di&s;charged an incumbent duty.</P>
<P>The next piece of this author was called <HI>Gib|ralter.</HI> It was a comedy, performed in 1705 and de&s;ervedly damned. <HI>Orpheus and Euridice,</HI> a ma&s;que, with little merit and no &s;ucce&s;s, followed in 1709.

<P><HI>Amyntas</HI> was a tran&s;lation and had no &s;ucce&s;s. It

was produced in 1698. The <HI>Grove,</HI> which the au|thor him&s;elf does not know what to make of, for he tells the critics that it was fir&s;t a pa&s;toral, but that the dignity of the characters rai&s;ed it into the form of a tragedy, was performed in 1703. Its &s;ucce&s;s we know nothing about; but, whether it was little or much its merits cannot be e&s;timated by it, for he was a violent party man, and therefore, wrong or right, mo&s;t votes of cour&s;e carried it. The <HI>Governor of Cyprus,</HI> a tragedy, was performed the &s;ame year, but of its &s;ucce&s;s nobody has informed us.</P>
<P>MOTTEAUX, though a Frenchman, wrote a number of things, and among others fifteen dramatic pieces. He was a con&s;iderable trader in the city, and improved his affairs by being a complete lingui&s;t, which qualification fitted him for carrying on foreign corre&s;pondence. His plays, except one of them, are of the light kind, and, in &s;ome of them, there is vi|vacity at lea&s;t, but no approach to excellence in any.</P>
<P><HI>Love's a Je&s;t,</HI> performed in 1696, had &s;ome &s;uc|ce&s;s, but &s;oon fell off, and has never &s;ince been re|vived. The <HI>Loves of Mars and Venus,</HI> 1697, taken from SHADWELL, MOLIERE, and an old Italian opera, was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the mu&s;ic of FINGER and ECCLES. It was a mere trifle, and at la&s;t introduced
<PB N="359" REF="354">
to make up a part of RAVENSCROFT's <HI>Anatomi&s;t. Novelty</HI> is a bad imitation of DAVENANT's <HI>Play|hou&s;e to Let. Europe's Revels</HI> was written on the peace of Ry&s;wick. <HI>Beauty in Di&s;tre&s;s</HI> is a tragedy, and has &s;omething, in parts of it, like writing, but upon the whole wants &s;trength and intere&s;t. The <HI>I&s;land Prince&s;s</HI> is only BEAUMONT and FLETCHER's play under the &s;ame title made into an opera, which had but little &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Four Sea&s;ons,</HI> a mu&s;ical trifle, the mu&s;ic by JEREMIAH CLARK, had its hour and died away. <HI>Acis and Galatea</HI> was of the &s;ame de&s;|cription; the mu&s;ic was compo&s;ed by ECCLES. <HI>Britain's Happine&s;s</HI> is al&s;o a mu&s;ical interlude. <HI>Ar|&s;inoc, Queen of Cypru&s;s,</HI> was an opera after the Ita|lian manner; we know nothing of its reception. The <HI>Amorous Mi&s;er</HI> is a comedy, The <HI>Temple of Love</HI> is a pa&s;toral opera, <HI>Thomyris, Queen of Scythia,</HI> is an opera, <HI>Love's Triumph</HI> is a pa&s;toral opera, and <HI>Love Dragooned</HI> is a farce, the la&s;t of the&s;e was brought out in 1708.</P>
<P>GILDON, who fell into the common error of fancying that, becau&s;e he was a man of learning, of nece&s;&s;ity he could not &s;ail to write, followed up a number of &s;ubjects with erudition enough, but without the &s;malle&s;t ray of genius. His plays are five in number and called The <HI>Roman Bride's Re|venge,</HI>
<PB N="360" REF="355">
<HI>Phaeton, Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure, Love's Victim,</HI> and The <HI>Patriot.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is a very ha&s;ty production, which, neverthele&s;s, would been wor&s;e, probably, by too much revi&s;ion; for GILDON always poli&s;hed away the &s;hape of his &s;ubject. It is a Roman &s;tory, and &s;macks of SENECA and JONSON, without the merits of either; a kind of &s;hadow of a figure in lead; it &s;eems to reflect the weight without being relieved by the prominences.</P>
<P><HI>Phaeton</HI> is an imitation of <HI>Euripides,</HI> and modelled according to the rules of the ancients, which is enough to prove that it could not &s;ucceed. It &s;old, however, &s;ays an author, &s;peaking of the merits of the play, for there were &s;ome &s;trictures annexed to it on COLLIER's book. <HI>Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure</HI> was a bad alteration of SHAKESPEAR's play. <HI>Love's Victim</HI> was damned, and The <HI>Patriot,</HI> which was taken from LEE's <HI>Lucius Junius Brutus,</HI> in &s;pight of the &s;upport it received from DENNIS and FARQHUAR, the fir&s;t of whom wrote the prologue, and the other the epi|logue, &s;hared the &s;ame fate.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. INFERIOR AUTHORS TO 1708.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now go into an account, a very &s;ummary one it mu&s;t be, of the inferior, or rather &s;ubordinate authors, for &s;ome of them, out of their dramatic em|ployment, have a fair claim to commendation, and the&s;e, to render my &s;tatement accurate, I &s;hall bring forward in chronological order to 1708.</P>
<P>Of BETTERTON I have hitherto only &s;poken as an actor. He wrote, however, or rather dabbled for the &s;tage, about in the &s;ame degree as BARON wrote in FRANCE. His fir&s;t play was a tragedy, called The <HI>Roman Virgin.</HI> It was performed in 1679, and turned out to be only an alteration of WEBSTER's <HI>Appius and Virginia.</HI> The <HI>Revenge, or a Match in Newgate,</HI> which DODSLEY has printed in his old Plays, without giving us his opinion, by
<PB N="362" REF="357">
the way, as to who is the author, is nothing more than MARSTON's <HI>Courtezan,</HI> better adapted, per|haps, to the &s;tage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prophete&s;s</HI> is BEAUMONT and FLETCHER's play altered into an opera. There is &s;ome &s;weet mu&s;ic in it, compo&s;ed by PURCEL; but, though it has been frequently revived it never plea&s;ed. BET|TERTON's arrival from FRANCE whith his &s;cenery gave him the fir&s;t idea of bringing forward this piece. <HI>Henry the Fourth</HI> is SHAKESPEAR's play indifferently altered. The <HI>Amorous Widow, or the Wanton Wife,</HI> is MOLIERE's <HI>George Dandin.</HI> There is &s;ome hu|mour in it, however, and it is &s;ometimes played as a farce even now. The <HI>Sequel of Henry the fourth</HI> is the &s;econd part of SHAKESPEAR's play as indif|ferently altered as the fir&s;t. BETTERTON per|formed Fal&s;taff and thought he could add to the effect of the character. He, however, found him&s;elf mi&s;taken. The <HI>Bondman,</HI> and The <HI>Woman made a Ju&s;tice,</HI> were in the &s;tyle of the re&s;t. The la&s;t of the&s;e pieces was performed in 1719, therefore the performance of BETTERTON's dramatic works took up a period of forty years, on which account I have &s;poken of them all together in this place. Some of them are po&s;thumous, for BETTERTON died in the year 1710.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="358">MOUNTFORT was al&s;o an author, and upon the whole of a better ca&s;t than BETTERTON; The <HI>In|jured Lovers,</HI> 1688, was a tragedy. LANGBAINE charges this author with having, like &s;ir COURTLY NICE, written for his own amu&s;ement, but without regarding wit. It had little &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Edward the Third,</HI> a tragedy, 1691, is &s;aid to be given to MOUNTFORT by BANCROFT. It is, however, taken from the well known &s;tory of the <HI>Counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury-Greenwich Park,</HI> a comedy, &s;ame year, &s;ucceeded pretty well. The <HI>Succe&s;sful Stangers</HI> is borrowed from SCARRON's <HI>Rival Brothers,</HI> but it had merit and de&s;erved the &s;ucce&s;s it met with. It came out in 1696. <HI>Zelmane</HI> was left unfini&s;hed by MOUNT|FORT, and completed by &s;ome friend after his death. It &s;ucceeded more probably out of compa&s;&s;ion to the memory of the author than from any intrin&s;ic value the play po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MOUNTFORT's untimely end engro&s;&s;ed public attention to &s;uch a degree at the time it happened, that it may not be ami&s;s to notice it here. Mrs. BRACEGIRDLE had, as we have already &s;een, a number of lovers, all of whom were un&s;ucce&s;sful, for her virtue was proof again&s;t every art. A man of the name of HILL; who, among the re&s;t had been repul&s;ed, was determined to carry her off, and for this purpo&s;e hired &s;ome ruffians; who, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of lord MOHUN, a kind of mohawk about LONDON, very nearly &s;uc|ceeded in his attempt. The lady, however, was re&s;cued and re|&s;tored to her friends. Thus di&s;appointed, he was determined to be revenged of MOUNTFORT, who played the love parts with Mrs. BRACEGIRDLE, and was con&s;idered as a favoured rival. They lo&s;t not a moment therefore, but, while they were warm in re&s;entment, went in&s;tantly and watched MOUNTFORT's hou&s;e, de|termined to execute their vengeance on him at his return. They were but too &s;ucce&s;sful. As he came up to the door, that &s;candal to his rank, lord MOHUN &s;aluted him in the mo&s;t friendly manner, which was the &s;ignal agreed upon for HILL to begin the a&s;&s;ault, who in&s;tantly knocked him down; and, before he had time to draw his &s;word, cowardly ran him through the body. HILL e&s;caped, and lord MOHUN was tried; but MOUNTFORT, with his dying breath, having declared him to be innocent, he was acquitted. He, however, afterwards fell in a duel by the &s;ame treachery, as he him|&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed, that he had practi&s;ed on MOUNTFORT.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="359">DOGGET produced a piece called The <HI>Country Wake,</HI> which is yet very well known, under the title of <HI>Hob in the Well.</HI> DRYDEN's &s;on wrote a comedy, called The <HI>Hu&s;band his own Cuckold.</HI> It had but little &s;ucce&s;s, though CONGREVE wrote the pro|logue, and the great DRYDEN the preface and the epilogue. TOM BROWNE, who was a facetious, low, impertinent wit, though a good &s;cholar, and by no means a bad writer, who&s;e vices and follies, had no reli&s;h for him unle&s;s they were excited by &s;ome|thing novel and excentric; who&s;e attachments were indi&s;criminate, and without &s;incerity, and who would rather lo&s;e his friend than his joke, wrote three
<PB N="365" REF="360">
pieces for the &s;tage; all as &s;trange and indefinable as him&s;elf. The&s;e were called <HI>Phy&s;ic lies a Bleed|ing,</HI> The <HI>Stage Beaux to&s;&s;ed in a Blanket,</HI> and The <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ary.</HI> The titles of the&s;e pieces pretty well &s;hew what they are. The &s;econd was a ridicule on COLLIER; and, by way of currying favour, it was dedicated to RICH. The <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ary</HI> was a mere farce.</P>
<P>BURNABY, a fa&s;hionable wit, wrote four fa&s;hion|able plays, for they were flimzey and &s;oon forgotten. The <HI>Reformed Wife,</HI> 1700, was as we are told, the ground work of CIBBER's <HI>Double Gallant,</HI> but this is not true; for the &s;ource is Spani&s;h, and CIBBER went to the fountain head when the water was clear, BURNABY took his opportunity when the water was muddy. The <HI>Lady's Vi&s;iting Day,</HI> 1701, was vi|&s;ited but once. The <HI>Modern Hu&s;band,</HI> 1702, was damned owing, as the author has told us, to its be|ing written in a month. The excu&s;e is in&s;ult added to imbecility. <HI>Love Betrayed,</HI> 1703, is &s;tolen from SHAKESPEAR's <HI>Twelfth Night,</HI> and in &s;o bare faced a manner that fifty lines were literally tran&s;cribed from it.</P>
<P>BAKER, who certainly had much more merit than BURNABY, has neverthele&s;s been much abu&s;ed
<PB N="366" REF="361">
and particularly by WHINCOP; who, at the &s;ame time he allows his plays to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;trong marks of the <HI>vis comica,</HI> &s;ays that they are de&s;titute of wit and humour; a &s;tyle of critici&s;m too often practi&s;ed. His plays came out in the following order:</P>
<P><HI>Humours of the Age,</HI> 1701, was a juvenile per|formance and written ha&s;tily. It certainly has very little to recommend it. <HI>Tunbridge Walks</HI> is a much better attempt. It came out in 1703, and contains both character and &s;atire, and rather of the merit|orious kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are told a curious circum&s;tance relative to this play. Maiden, which character is certainly the origin of all the Fribbles &s;ince that time, was written to expo&s;e a &s;olly of which this author had been guilty of, and which his own under&s;tanding and ob&s;er|vation had taught him to correct. There certainly cannot be any thing &s;o contemptible in any one who wears the form of man as effeminacy; and, if it be true that BAKER ridiculed this puerile and pitiful vice in him&s;elf to warn others again&s;t it, le&s;t they &s;hould incur univer&s;al contempt, we mu&s;t confe&s;s he had a mo&s;t uncommon degree of Spartan forbearance. It would be no harm if it were oftner imitated.</NOTE>. <HI>Act at Oxford,</HI> 1704, a comedy, was con&s;idered as a rude and unbecoming &s;atire again&s;t the Univer&s;ity, and, therefore, prohibited. <HI>Hamp&s;tead Heath,</HI> however, which appeared in 1706, was little more than the former play with alterations. It was as ill received as the other. <HI>Fine Ladies</HI>
<PB N="367" REF="362">
<HI>Airs,</HI> 1709, had &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s. Of the&s;e plays <HI>Tun|bridge Walks</HI> upon the whole is greatly &s;uperior to the re&s;t, and is, indeed, the only piece of this au|thor that has kept the &s;tage.</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t lo&s;t time to enumerate many more of the&s;e authors but cu&s;tom, and indeed critical nece&s;&s;ity demand it.

<P>NORTON wrote a play called <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> which GARTH has thus celebrated:
<Q><L>And Britain, &s;ince <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> was writ,</L>
<L>Knows Spartan virtue, and Athenian wit.</L></Q></P>
<P>COULD, who was fir&s;t a footman, and afterwards a &s;choolma&s;ter, wrote the <HI>Rival Si&s;ters,</HI> a play &s;tolen from SHIRLEY, and <HI>God's Revenge again&s;t Murder.</HI> SCOTT, lord ROXBURGH's &s;ecretary, wrote The <HI>Mock Marriage,</HI> and <HI>Unhappy Kindne&s;s.</HI> The fir&s;t a puerile attempt, and the other a theft from BEAU|MONT and FLETCHER, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"con&s;iderably improved,"</Q>

<P>FILMER, who was a &s;trong advocate for the &s;tage again&s;t COLLIER, wrote a tragedy called The <HI>Unnatural Brother,</HI> which was even duller than COLLIER's book. DRAKE, who was a phy&s;ician, and a political writer, and therefore perpetually in|curring the re&s;entment of death and the pillory, wrote The <HI>Sham Lawyer,</HI> borrowed from BEAU|MONT and FLETCHER. PHILIPS, who, according to &s;ome, wrote one play, to others, two plays, to others three, and to others four, was bred in IRE|LAND and critici&s;ed by Iri&s;hmen, whence has ari&s;en, perhaps, &s;o many bulls. The name of PHILIPS is prefixed to four plays called The <HI>Revengeful Queen, Hibernia Freed, St. Stephen's Green,</HI> and <HI>Belifarius,</HI> but whether the&s;e pieces were the production of four PHILIPSES, or only the PHILIPS &s;poken of at pre|&s;ent, is perfectly immaterial.</P>
<P>The <HI>Revengeful Queen,</HI> taken from &s;ir WILLIAM DAVENANT, was not worth &s;tealing. <HI>Hibernia Freed</HI> is a very confined bu&s;ine&s;s. <HI>St. Stephen's Green</HI> was not thronged with much company, and
<PB N="369" REF="364">
<HI>Beli&s;arius</HI> begged in vain for applau&s;e. WILLIAM WALKER, who went on the &s;tage, and afterwards died attorney general at Barbadoes, wrote <HI>Victorius Love,</HI> a tragedy, and <HI>Marry or do Wor&s;e,</HI> a comedy. The fir&s;t performed in 1698, and the other in 1704. THOMAS WALKER wrote a comedy called The <HI>Wit of a Woman.</HI> SMITH, a barri&s;ter, wrote The <HI>Prince&s;s of Parma.</HI> MANNING, who was a man of &s;ome con&s;ideration and employed in different em|ba&s;&s;ies to SWITZERLAND, was the author of The <HI>Generous Choice,</HI> and <HI>All for the Better,</HI> both come|dies.

<P>The famous BOYER, known by his celebrated Grammer and Dictionary, fled to ENGLAND at the Revolution, being a French Prote&s;tant, and was au|thor of many ingenious works, the wor&s;t of which was a play called <HI>Achilles in Aulis.</HI> COREY, fir&s;t a barri&s;ter and afterwards an actor, was author of a comedy called <HI>A Cure for Jealou&s;y,</HI> and a farce called The <HI>Metamorpho&s;is.</HI> The fir&s;t was totally neglected, de&s;ervedly indeed, owing, however, in &s;ome degree to the great run of the <HI>Con&s;tant Couple,</HI> which

<P>HIGGINS, a &s;taunch adherent to JAMES the &s;econd, wrote a play called The <HI>Generous Conqueror,</HI> the writing of which &s;macks more of the gentleman than the poet.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. THE STAGE FROM 1708 TO GARRICK.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een that, through the inetrference of co|lonel BRETT, who&s;e conduct was certainly dictated by CIBBER, that, in 1708, the Haymarket and Drury Lane were e&s;tabli&s;hed upon &s;eparate intere&s;ts; the fir&s;t, under the management of SWINEY, for the ex|hibition of operas, and the other for plays under the direction of the Patentees, with RICH at their head.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now follow the &s;tage, through all its changes and vici&s;&s;itudes, from that time to GAR|RICK's fir&s;t appearance in Goodman's Fields; which period, almo&s;t thirty three years, involves &s;uch a variety of circum&s;tances that, though I mean to be per&s;piciuous, I &s;hall not have room to be elaborate.</P>
<P>Operas, which I &s;hall hereafter give a &s;eperate
<PB N="375" REF="370">
account of, began to receive con&s;iderable patronage from the nobility, but they would not probably have keep any material &s;tand upon their own foundation, had the experiment been tried for any length of time, which it was not; for in a year after this new e&s;tabli&s;hment, SWINEY was again joined by the ac|tors, under a new re&s;triction.</P>
<P>The particulars which led to this were as various as they were extraordinary, I &s;hall, therefore, give the reader the mo&s;t accurate &s;tatement I have been able to collect. RICH, who feared that if the the|atre &s;hould pro&s;per it would bring on the moment of retribution, for the rea&s;ons I formerly &s;tated; no &s;ooner felt that the &s;trength of the actors, thus united, brought full hou&s;es than, anxious, as CIBBER whim&s;ically has it, of recovering the &s;tage to its for|mer confu&s;ion, a conduct incomprehen&s;ible to every body but him&s;elf, he &s;et about oppo&s;ing BRETT; who, with CIBBER at his elbow, had certainly began to work a laudable reformation, and who had &s;tudied &s;o well the intere&s;ts of the different members of the concern, that actors, authors, and patentees, began to have hope of receiving the ju&s;tice which had been long due to them.</P>
<P>This di&s;ta&s;trous event, for &s;o he con&s;idered it,
<PB N="376" REF="371">
RICH was determined to prevent. He began his mea&s;ures by tampering with the patentees; and, as he knew that nothing could &s;o completely put them off their guard as his &s;eeming to adopt a &s;em|blance of equity, he appeared to deplore that the concern had not been before in a &s;tate to render them that ju&s;tice they were entitled to; but that, now it began to be pro&s;perous, it would be but fair in him and Mr. BRETT to make among them &s;uch divi&s;ions of the profits as the &s;cheme would bear, by way of bringing up former arrears.</P>
<P>This &s;pecious kind of conduct he knew would operate two ways. It would induce the patentees to admit that he would have adopted it before had his ability been equal to his inclination, and it would open BRETT's eyes in &s;uch a manner, by exhibiting to him the alarming &s;tate in which the concern was involved, great part of which, however, was ima|ginary, many of the demands being brought forward by his tools and actually his own; that the fir&s;t would be more patient, under an idea that their lo&s;&s;es might be one day or other made up, and the other would grow indifferent, or rather alarmed, as having embarked in a &s;cheme which, let it &s;ucceed how it might, &s;tood &s;o little chance of yielding profit, pro|portionable to the trouble and anxiety attending it.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="372">Both the&s;e con&s;equences were the re&s;ult of RICH's machiavalian &s;cheme. He began to gain the confidence of the patentees, and BRETT began to be di&s;contented, and now, that he might profit by the effects of his duplicity dre&s;&s;ed like candour, he cau&s;ed a friend to &s;ugge&s;t to SKIPWITH, who the reader will remember gave up his &s;hare to BRETT, that, as the theatre was now become an object of con&s;iderable con&s;equence, it would be greatly to his intere&s;t to re&s;ume his right, under the idea that he had only yielded it up to BRETT in the nature of a loan.</P>
<P>What arguments were upon this occa&s;ion held out to SKIPWITH I cannot learn, but it is certainly true that he &s;erved BRETT which a Chancery &s;up|poena, alledging that the a&s;&s;ignment of the &s;hare was only a conveyance in tru&s;t. BRETT was piqued at this, and, though he clearly proved that it was nei|ther a&s;&s;igned upon tru&s;t nor upon any other limi|tation whatever; yet, as the world knew he had paid no con&s;ideration for it, and as he &s;corned an obligation under a convention which was &s;o illi|berally kept, he in&s;tantly re&s;igned it, wi&s;hing SKIP|WITH le&s;s trouble and more profit than he him&s;elf had experienced.</P>
<P>BRETT immediately withdrew him&s;elf from the
<PB N="378" REF="373">
concern, and, as the formalities nece&s;&s;ary for the rea&s;&s;ignment of the &s;hare were &s;o con&s;iderably de|layed, probably through the connivance of RICH, as not to be completed till after the death of SKIP|WITH, our &s;ubtle politician remained without an opponent except the other patentees, to the manage|ment of whom he was pretty well accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>Having occa&s;ion for &s;ome of the&s;e in quality of tools, he now began his next plan of operations, which was as formerly to tyranize over the actors. He repre&s;ented to his partners, whom he now af|fected to con&s;ult upon all occa&s;ions, that the actors were too well paid and, that if it met with their ap|probation he &s;hould lower their &s;aleries. He, of cour&s;e, received no oppo&s;ition, and this very equi|table determination was not only re&s;olved on but in|&s;tantly put into execution. It was not, however, very quietly &s;ubmitted to. Some remon&s;trated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CIBBER, who argued the matter pretty roundly with the pa|tentees, was told by one of them that even, with his reduced &s;alary, he had more than GOODMAN received, who was a better actor. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That may be true,"</Q> &s;aid CIBBER,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but you will plea&s;e to re|collect that GOODMAN was forced to go upon the highway for a livelihood."</Q></NOTE>, others grumbled, and others vowed revenge; which, as there was now no other theatre to go to, was treated with perfect indifference.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="374">From this time the affairs of the theatre, of cour&s;e, got into that &s;tate which it appears to have been the delight of RICH's life to &s;ee them in. The actors grew carele&s;s, the hou&s;es empty, the patentees di&s;con|tented; all confidence was de&s;troyed, and the only theatre was, like the goo&s;e, cut up for tho&s;e golden eggs which nothing could produce but time and ma|turity. In &s;hort, being mulet of their immunities, the actors re&s;olved at once to de&s;ert the profe&s;&s;ion or obtain redre&s;s.</P>
<P>This la&s;t impo&s;ition they conceived would be a good ground work for a complaint to the Lord Chamberlain. They found intere&s;t to get it pre|ferred and they obtained relief; for an order was immediately i&s;&s;ued to the patentees to &s;hew cau&s;e why the benefits of the actors had been dimini&s;hed one third, contrary to common u&s;age. The patentees pleaded that the actors had &s;igned a paper agreeing to this deduction, and had given their receipts for the two thirds as a full compen&s;ation. This was de|clared to have been compul&s;ion on the &s;ide of the managers which the actors were too powerle&s;s to re|&s;i&s;t; and the patentees, in an&s;wer, in&s;i&s;ted that even though it were compul&s;ion it was certainly law. The Lord Chamberlain, neverthele&s;s, warned the
<PB N="380" REF="375">
patentees to refu&s;e the actors full ju&s;tice at their peril.</P>
<P>So far, however, from li&s;tening to this advice, or caring for the con&s;equence of di&s;obeying it, the actors were more oppre&s;&s;ed than ever. The&s;e grievances were properly repre&s;ented and well &s;ub|&s;tantiated; and, the very next year after Drury Lane was e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a foundation, which, had the proprietors been wi&s;e, nothing could have &s;haken, an order was received from the Lord Chamberlain to &s;hut up the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This done, SWINEY, now manager of the Hay|market, as we have &s;een, for the purpo&s;e of exhi|biting operas only, had his power &s;o extended that he was permitted to enter into a treaty with the prin|cipal actors in order to form a company under the direction of &s;uch of them as &s;hould be cho&s;en by a majority of them&s;elves from their own body; &s;o that plays at the Haymarket might again be united with operas.</P>
<P>The managers pitched upon were WILKS, DOG|GET, Mrs. OLDFIELD, and CIBBER, which latter, by every collateral proof I can collect, had been the engine all the way through the bu&s;ine&s;s; had &s;timulated BRETT, had fore&s;een the folly of RICH
<PB N="381" REF="376">
and its con&s;equences, and had felt from the moment he became of any importance to the theatre that he &s;hould one day or other be one of its rulers; which every man mu&s;t con&s;ider as a laudable ambition, &s;ince his intention had been all along to take care of its proper intere&s;t.</P>
<P>BETTERTON and BOOTH would certainly have been parties in the treaty; but the fir&s;t was on the point of leaving the &s;tage, and the other had mani|fe&s;ted little more than the dawn of that reputation which was afterwards &s;o brilliant. Indeed Mrs. OLDFIELD, who was nominated one of the di|rectors, very wi&s;ely propo&s;ed to receive two hun|dred a year, which CIBBER tells us was at la&s;t worth &s;ix in lieu of a &s;hare, and thus WILKS, DOGGET, and CIBBER, but in fact CIBBER only, for he al|ways admini&s;tered &s;o to the contradictory tempers of his partners as to be the general referee, became managers of the plays, and SWINEY of the operas.</P>
<P>In the mean time, RICH, who had deceived him&s;elf with a hope that the prohibition, after due contrition had been manife&s;ted and due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion paid, would be taken off, kept together as many of the actors as would &s;tay, and more than he had an inclination to pay. He held the patent and the
<PB N="382" REF="377">
broad &s;eal was as vi&s;ible as ever, and his opinion was, as a lawyer, that it was a &s;tretch of the Lord Cham|berlain's power beyond its limits to &s;ilence him at all, for that the quarrel with the actors was a private bu&s;ine&s;s, and that he was only amenable to the courts of law for his conduct.</P>
<P>Thus he was again playing a double game. If permi&s;&s;ion to perform had been renewed, he had &s;ome actors ready for his purpo&s;e, if not, by re|pre&s;enting to the patentees the hopele&s;s &s;ituation of the concern, he &s;hould naturally get the patent ex|clu&s;ively to him&s;elf, and po&s;&s;e&s;s that &s;upreme power which, whether active or inactive, whether profitable or unprofitable, he had been all his life gra&s;ping at. The latter happened. RICH was actually put out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Drury Lane, and the other patentees I have no doubt from that moment to this, never ex|hibited a &s;ingle &s;ympton of laying any further claim to the patent or any of its rights and privileges.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee how RICH happened to be di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his theatre. Having made an agree|ment with the landlords, not for a given price by the year but for three pounds a day whenever it &s;hould be opened as a place of entertainment, and the land|lords, during the operation of the prohibition, not
<PB N="383" REF="378">
having received a &s;ingle &s;ixpence for rent, they be|gan to repent of the &s;ort of agreement they had en|tered into, by which a tenant might po&s;&s;e&s;s a large premi&s;es without being &s;ubject to pay any rent, and was ca&s;ting about in their minds how to ou&s;t RICH when a circum&s;tance occurred that completely &s;a|tisfied them.</P>
<P>A fa&s;hionable man, one of the members for CORNWALL, and a lawyer, of the name of COL|LIER, had long con&s;idered the management of a theatre a good &s;cheme if it could be dive&s;ted of all tho&s;e incumbrances under which it had &s;o long bent down. This man, who was a good match for RICH, exerted his intere&s;t at court and procured a licence, for he knew that would an&s;wer his purpo&s;e as well as a patent e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of Parliament, for acting plays; and, as he knew the licence mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily name the place of performance, he went to the landlords of the Drury Lane theatre, agreed with them upon a larger rent for a lea&s;e of tho&s;e premi&s;es, taking it upon his own ri&s;k to turn RICH out. Having this lea&s;e and this licence in his pocket, he took the advantage of a rejoicing night, when all was tumult and uproar, ru&s;hed into the hou&s;e with a hired mob, and forcibly turned its old occupier into the &s;treet.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="379">The novelty of the circum&s;tance for a time turned the tide of public favour on the &s;ide of our new adventurers. BOOTH, who had, perhaps, been di&s;atisfied at not having been admitted into the di|rection of the Haymarket, headed the actors and certainly began to acquire con&s;iderable reputation. Mi&s;s SANTLOW al&s;o, who had been greatly admired as a dancer, now commenced actre&s;s; and her fir&s;t appearance in the character of the Fair Quaker of Deal, which SHADWELL wrote purpo&s;ely for her, gained her &s;o much reputation that, &s;ays CIBBER,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not the enthu&s;ia&s;tic maid of Orleans was more &s;erviceable of old to the French army, when the Engli&s;h had di&s;tre&s;&s;ed them, than this fair Qua|ker was, at the head of that dramatic attempt, upon which the &s;upport of their weak &s;ociety depended."</Q></P>
<P>Let us now return to RICH. He had taken a lea&s;e of the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields ever &s;ince BETTERTON had left it, evidently with a view of pre|venting his return provided the Haymarket, under VANBRUGH and CONGREVE &s;hould have turned out unprofitable; but CIBBER in&s;i&s;ts that he &s;ore&s;aw all that would happen, and provided him&s;elf with an a&s;ylum in ca&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s. Certainly all his conduct is equal to this; it having always conduced to his
<PB N="385" REF="380">
own ends, at the &s;ame time that it was incomprehen|&s;ible to every body el&s;e.</P>
<P>Under the influence of this &s;ort of pre&s;cience, for &s;o it turned out, he in&s;tantly &s;et about building this theatre from the ground; and, though he did not live long enough to &s;ee it opened, his &s;on, un|der the old patent, without any &s;olicitation for its re|action, but with perfect indifference as to all con&s;e|quences, even though it was not given for that the|tre, began a new dramatic career which has con|tinued uninterrupted from that hour to this.</P>
<P>The moment CIBBER and his partners got po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;ituation in the Haymarket, they were determined to adopt every &s;pirited idea to de|&s;erve the favour and attention of the town. They altered the con&s;truction of the theatre, ca&s;t their plays in a very judicious &s;tyle, and began to hope, that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the operas, which had hi|therto greatly &s;ucceeded, the &s;tage would become creditable and productive. They were &s;oon con|vinced of their error. The operas which had been a novelty the year before began now to fall off; the cau&s;e we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter. SACHEVFRAL's trial al&s;o, which was attended by all the fir&s;t people in the kingdom, and COLLIER's new expedition, with
<PB N="386" REF="381">
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mi&s;s SANTLOW, were al&s;o draw|backs; and, though they did not actually fail, yet they had little more to rejoice at than their own emancipation from their old tyranny.</P>
<P>SACHEVERAL's trial over, which fini&s;hed with the run of the Fair Quaker of Deal, COLLIER be|gan to find that the tide turned in favour of the Hay|market; he, therefore, determined on a new &s;cheme, in which, for he was a <HI>bon vivant,</HI> and in other re|&s;pects a favourite with the great, he &s;ucceeded. This &s;cheme was neither more nor le&s;s than to give up Drury Lane, cloaths, &s;cenes, and actors to SWINEY and his partners, and become him&s;elf the &s;ole po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or of the Haymarket and manager of the operas.</P>
<P>To &s;hew the extent of COLLIER's influence this agreement was clogged with two unplea&s;ant con|ditions. One was, that, as an exclu&s;ive licence for acting plays was held a more profitable thing than one for performing operas, the Drury Lane mana|gers &s;hould allow COLLIER two hundred a year, as long as, through his intere&s;t at court, all other actors &s;hould be interdicted, and the other was that on every Wedne&s;day, the players &s;hould be entirely &s;ilent, in order to give the opera a fairer chance for a full hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="382">It is curious to ob&s;erve how artfully all this was planned. COLLIER from experience began to find that his own knowledge of theatrical matters was in&s;ufficient, and that, change as often as he might, no &s;ucce&s;s was to be expected under his management. Thus, when he had &s;tipulated for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the opera hou&s;e upon &s;uch advantageous terms, he had nothing to do but appear to have a reluctance to part with it and he knew he &s;hould have plenty of bidders for the &s;ituation. This happened exactly as he conjectured. AARON HILL &s;eemed very de&s;irous to treat with him; and, after &s;ome difficulty in adju&s;ting the terms, it was at length agreed that he &s;hould have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the theatre upon pay|ing COLLIER &s;ix hundred a year.</P>
<P>To &s;hew, however, that he could do what he plea&s;ed; when, upon finding through HILL's ma|nagement, that the profits began to be con&s;iderable, he &s;ome how or other found out an informality in the agreement, and took the property back to him&s;elf before the &s;ea&s;on was over; while HILL, who was too wi&s;e, or too powerle&s;s, to contend with him, re|linqui&s;hed his right without murmuring.</P>
<P>He was now completely outwitted; for, from the
<PB N="388" REF="383">
moment he took the direction again, his affairs went backward; finding therefore, that he &s;tood no chance, &s;ingle handed, of making any public amu&s;ement pro|ductive, he determined once more to try the influ|ence of his court intere&s;t; and, in the mo&s;t bare|faced manner, &s;o wrought his project to his ends, that SWINEY by a fre&s;h mandate was obliged to change with COLLIER, and take the Haymarket with all its &s;ins upon its head; which &s;ins &s;o operated to its damnation, that SWINEY the next year was obliged to prefer the air of the Continent to the air of a pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Nothing could be &s;o unplea&s;ant as the &s;ituation that CIBBER and his fellow labourers were driven into by this &s;tretch of power in COLLIER. He be|came their ta&s;k ma&s;ter, and dictated what terms he thought proper. Knowing, however, by experience that every thing would go wrong if he attempted exclu&s;ively to manage the concern, he thought his wi&s;e&s;t way would be to accept of a certainty and make a &s;inecure of it. He, therefore, demanded &s;ix hundred a year, the price at which he had farmed out the opera, and a moiety of the two hundred that had been levied in Drury Lane the year before in aid of the opera; in all &s;even hundred pounds. By this, indeed, he lo&s;t three hundred a year, for
<PB N="389" REF="384">
the managers averaged more than a thou&s;and a year each, the whole time he continued at the head of the theatre, which was, however, no longer than the death of the queen in 1714. He did not, after this agreement, for the rea&s;ons we have &s;een, think proper to attempt any alteration, but enjoyed his remune|ration and let them work for it.</P>
<P>The theatre for the fir&s;t time now felt &s;ome con&s;e|quence. DOGGET was naturally frugal; WILKS, if he ran into expence, took care it &s;hould be for the intere&s;t of the concern; and CIBBER, who knew that the par&s;imony of the one would operate as a &s;ufficient check upon the extravagance of the other, let them fairly have their way; while he him&s;elf &s;tudied continually how he might e&s;tabli&s;h decorum, promulgate morality, and in all their money con|cerns &s;o equitably demean them&s;elves as to &s;ecure, what no managers had ever before boa&s;ted of, the cha|racter of fairne&s;s and punctuality in their dealings; and it is remarkable that this conduct was &s;o honour|ably per&s;evered in, during twenty years from the time this triumvirate began to conduct the theatre, that no trade&s;man came a &s;econd time for his bill, nor was a &s;ingle author, actor, or other per&s;on, employed about the hou&s;e at any time refu&s;ed his or her ju&s;t due, even though there never was, which is a &s;ingular
<PB N="390" REF="385">
fact, any one agreement in writing executed be|tween them.</P>
<P>The conduct of the theatre being pretty well &s;ettled, nothing worthy the attention of the reader pa&s;&s;ed till 1714, except the admi&s;&s;ion of BOOTH into the management, and DOGGET's &s;ece&s;&s;ion, which came about in con&s;equence of the reputation BOOTH acquired in performing Cato. This happened in 1712, great part of which, however, though infinite merit is to be attributed to BOOTH, was owing to the popularity of the play; for, at a part of the &s;ea&s;on when it was cu&s;tomary to perform but three times a week, it had a run for a month together, ex|cept on the Mondays.</P>
<P>DOGGET had long been tormented with the fret|ful temper of WILKS; and, in &s;pight of CIBBER's conciliatory manner, who generally &s;ucceeded in ac|commodating all difficulties, was at the particular moment when Cato fir&s;t made its appearance, ex|tremely &s;ore in con&s;equence of his having intro|duced actors without the general con&s;ent, and other di&s;agreeable things. CIBBER, to divert his attention from this, called it to &s;omething which he con&s;idered as much more material than a few partner&s;hip bick|erings. This was no le&s;s than a &s;u&s;picion that
<PB N="391" REF="386">
BOOTH, having grown &s;o &s;uddenly into fame, would aim at being manager, e&s;pecially as he had received various marks of favour, and, among the re&s;t, a pur&s;e of fifty guineas which had been in one even|ing collected for him in the boxes.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance, which really &s;o far from be|ing a remuneration &s;eems to have been very little more than the halfpence formerly thrown on the &s;tage at Sadler's Wells for the rope dancers, DOG|GET con&s;idered as a thing of con&s;equence; and, forgetting for a moment his quarrel to WILKS, pro|po&s;ed, by way of quelling all ambition in BOOTH, that the managers &s;hould &s;pontaneou&s;ly give him an addition of fifty guineas to the &s;um already be&s;towed on him by the public. CIBBER &s;aw that &s;uch a mea&s;ure would awaken his ambition in&s;tead of lulling it a&s;leep; but, finding WILKS cordially coincide with DOGGET, he con&s;ented to purcha&s;e their recon|ciliation by a means which would at wor&s;t do no more than accelerate what perhaps could not be avoided.</P>
<P>On the return of the company from OXFORD, where it had been the cu&s;tom for them to perform during the act term, and when BOOTH had gathered fre&s;h laurels, the friends of this gentleman &s;ugge&s;ted to him that he had been too long kept out of that
<PB N="392" REF="387">
&s;ituation which he had richly merited. He naturally li&s;tened to their opinions and accepted the offers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance which followed them up, which were at length &s;o efficacious that a new licence was pro|cured, which even COLLIER could not prevent, where BOOTH's name was added to the names of the former managers.</P>
<P>DOGGET remon&s;trated again&s;t this tooth and nail, but to no purpo&s;e; till, finding the point carried in &s;pight of his teeth he retired from the concern, de|termined, however, to demand his profits as they &s;hould accrue. This was of cour&s;e objected to, and he threw the matter into Chancery; where he was de|creed &s;ix hundred pounds for his &s;hare, &s;o that he lo&s;t a large &s;um; for BOOTH had hand&s;omely offered on his coming into the concern to give him five hun|dred a year for life for his profits.</P>
<P>We now come to the acce&s;&s;ion of GEORGE the fir&s;t, when matters completely took a new turn. CIBBER, for in all material points he certainly and very properly was the dictator, grown heartily &s;ick of COLLIER, conceived a very &s;ea&s;ible means of fairly getting rid of him. He did not value the &s;even hundred a year that he had been paid, becau&s;e he had &s;een the very great advantage of having their
<PB N="393" REF="388">
pretentions backed by a firm friend at court; but the tide of court favour being now completely turned, an idea &s;truck him that he might &s;ecure a friend highly popular, with &s;trong intere&s;t and rich ability to be &s;erviceable to the theatre it&s;elf.</P>
<P>This friend was no other than &s;ir RICHARD STEELE, the &s;olicitation of who&s;e alliance CIBBER &s;aw would procure great popularity for them&s;elves; for it would be con&s;idered as a mea&s;ure not only very judicous but very grateful. STEELE had al|ways loved the theatre, he had be&s;towed on it &s;ome of his labours, and he had by his recommendation of the players in his <HI>Tatlers</HI> given them a con&s;e|quence that had made them emulous to de&s;erve the characters of gentlemen, and men of honour and re&s;pectability. In addition to this, CIBBER, knew STEELE's influence with the duke of MARLBOROUGH, the hero of his heart, as he emphatically calls him, to whom, to be brief, he applied, and a licence was in&s;tantly made out confirming the power in STEELE, CIBBER, WILKS, and BOOTH, and completely di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing COLLIER.</P>
<P>In the mean time the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, opened under the &s;on of RICH, the former patentee, who conceived he had a right to exerci&s;e a patent which king CHARLES had certainly a right
<PB N="394" REF="389">
to grant, and which as certainly no equal power had formally revoked. There is &s;ome account of a pri|vate declaration to this effect having been made by the king, but this is doubted; and that the prohi|bition was officially removed cannot po&s;&s;ibly be true. It is enough to &s;ay that it was &s;u&s;pended by a &s;train of authority, though the mea&s;ure was equi|table; and, that authority cea&s;ing, the patent re|&s;umed its former action.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of this theatre was not brilliant, yet it was, for a time, &s;ufficient to check a little the pro|fits of Drury Lane, which induced CIBBER to con|&s;ider, that, as the licence he and his partners held was only during plea&s;ure, and the other a permanent grant from the crown, it would be a proper thing to procure &s;ome better &s;ecurity; to do which he repre|&s;ented to STEELE what were his &s;entiments on the &s;ubject, and al&s;o &s;ubmitted to him as COLLIER's pen&s;ion, which he now enjoyed, was given on con|dition that it &s;hould be only payable during the time Drury Lane &s;hould perform exclu&s;ively, whe|ther it would not be fair, in&s;tead of granting him a po&s;itive &s;um, to admit him a partner on a pro|portionable &s;hare.</P>
<P>STEELE's an&s;wer to this propo&s;ition was; that as he came among them by their own invitation, he
<PB N="395" REF="390">
&s;hould always think him&s;elf obliged to come into any mea&s;ures for their u&s;e and &s;afety; and, with the&s;e &s;entiments, he not only hand&s;omely acceded to their propo&s;al, but procured a patent for his own life and three years afterwards, which he a&s;&s;igned over to them, and confirmed to them a right in the whole property, on which he had certainly not ex|pended any thing, re&s;erving to him&s;elf a fourth of the profits for his intere&s;t and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>This generous and moderate conduct of STEELE was rewarded; for, in&s;tead of &s;even hundred a year during his life, it yielded him a thou&s;and, except tho&s;e drawbacks which he had incurred by the ne|glect of his own affairs, which he managed &s;o im|prudently that they were almo&s;t always in tru&s;t; and thus the be&s;t part of his fortune was continually &s;crambled for by the lawyers.</P>
<P>The grant for this patent having given to Drury Lane a permanent &s;ecurity, the managers went on very &s;piritedly. They laid out &s;ix hundred pounds upon DRYDEN's <HI>All for Love,</HI> and got up other pieces with equal &s;plendour; till every art was practi&s;ed by their enemies, and, among other things, a report was propagated that the foundation of the theatre was
<PB N="396" REF="391">
un&s;afe, and that the building would certainly fall upon the heads of the audience. This calumny only fell, however, on the heads of the calumniators, for &s;ir THOMAS HEWET, having &s;urveyed it by an order from the king, and &s;igned an atte&s;tation, which was printed in the new&s;papers, that it was perfectly &s;afe and in &s;ound condition, the &s;pectators, who had kept away during the alarm, now came in much greater numbers.</P>
<P>The&s;e fortunate circum&s;tances, together with the unremitting indu&s;try of the managers, gained them &s;o decided a &s;uperiority over their opponents in Lincoln's Inn Fields that the&s;e la&s;t were &s;oon obliged to call in foreign aid, and this gave birth to tho&s;e pantomimes, which RICH brought forward with &s;uch wonderful &s;ucce&s;s, and which have given ri&s;e, or at lea&s;t efficaciou&s;ly revived, tho&s;e &s;pectacles which have &s;o often di&s;graced and vitiated the na|tional ta&s;te<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is curious that FIELDING and CIBBER, who heartily hated each other, and who thought differently on every other &s;ubject, &s;hould completely coincide on this. FIELDING wrote a very &s;en&s;ible treati&s;e to &s;hew that the encrea&s;e of robberies in this kingdom was entirely owing to the gin &s;hops, where the poor people &s;o intoxicated their &s;en&s;es as to make them ripe for all manner of vice. In con&s;e|quence of this treati&s;e, and &s;ome other repre&s;entations, an act pa&s;&s;ed to put down tho&s;e nui&s;ances. CIBBER in like manner calls the&s;e &s;pectacles the gin &s;hops of the &s;tage, which intoxicate its auditors, di&s;honour their under&s;tandings, and introduce a levity that renders them ripe for every kind of profligacy. Pity that the morals of the more enlightened were not as worthy the attention of the legi&s;lature as tho&s;e of the vulgar. The avenues of the theatres would then, perhaps, le&s;s re&s;emble brothels.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="392">As the re&s;pectability with which Drury Lane was conducted, and the &s;hew and finery introduced at Lincoln's Inns Fields, attracted their &s;eparate ad|mirers to &s;uch a degree as to be productive to both theatres, very little happened for many years, ex|cept a few &s;truggles, the particulars of which, though in &s;ome degree curious, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to enu|merate here, to ob&s;truct that mutual emulation which though not always creditable, generally brought with it a proportionable profit.</P>
<P>As, however, the chapter of numbers does not by any means include the judicious, RICH, in pro|gre&s;s of time, carried the greate&s;t number of votes, and CIBBER was, at length, with great reluctance it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, obliged to &s;ail with the &s;tream, and to &s;trengthen the reputation of SHAKESPEAR, by the magic power of Harlequin. Being a&s;ked why he did this, he an&s;wered, he did it again&s;t his con|&s;cience, but that he had not virtue enough to &s;tarve by oppo&s;ing a multitude that would have been too hard for him.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="393">In this manner did the two theatres per&s;evere in their different efforts till the death of &s;ir RICHARD STEELE, which happened in 1729, for their private di&s;putes never effected their public intere&s;t. As to RICH, he was remarkably fortunate, which is not very wonderful when we con&s;ider he had all the fools on his &s;ide, but he was the vaine&s;t and perhaps the mo&s;t ignorant of all human beings, and therefore it will not be wondered at, that, as he drew all his fortune from foreign auxiliaries they &s;hould have both cunning and knavery enough to draw it from him. In &s;hort he was always &s;ucce&s;sful and always poor, and would, perhaps, have been obliged to put the patent, which his father had been at &s;uch un|wearied and &s;uch very hone&s;t pains to re&s;erve for him, to who bids mo&s;t, if <HI>The Beggar's Opera</HI> had not licked him whole.</P>
<P>The only interruption the harmony of the Drury Lane partner&s;hip experienced was the ab&s;ence of STEELE, in 1720, when his affairs were become &s;o di&s;tracted that he grew carele&s;s of all engagements. There has been another interruption mentioned which I cannot find the &s;malle&s;t ground for crediting. We read that CIBBER having &s;omehow offended the duke of NEWCASTLE, in the year 1720, he not only forbad him to perform but that, being after|wards
<PB N="399" REF="394">
offended by STEELE, he actually &s;ilenced the patent; but by a remon&s;trance, or &s;ome other way, it was amicably adju&s;ted, though the only reporter of this anecdote does not know what way.</P>
<P>All I have to offer in oppo&s;ition to this relation is that I cannot find the &s;malle&s;t trace of this cir|cum&s;tance either in the lives of STEELE or CIBBER, not even in the accounts of them written by the au|thor of the above a&s;&s;ertion. The theatre was cer|tainly never &s;ilenced; and, as to CIBBER's having di&s;obliged the duke of NEWCASTLE, he &s;peaks of that nobleman in terms of the highe&s;t re&s;pect, and in&s;tances a circum&s;tance of &s;elf denial, and di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s, as a proof of his attention to the mana|gers, and a motive of their gratitude to him. I take the fact to be, that, as STEELE oppo&s;ed the peerage bill in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and con&s;equently grew out of court favour, and as he gained that favour in a &s;tronger degree than ever by his &s;pirited &s;trictures again&s;t the mi&s;chievous South Sea &s;cheme, the mi&s;take has ari&s;en from a &s;uppo&s;ition that the theatre as well as the office he held was during that interval &s;u&s;pended, but this is impo&s;&s;ible; for, to make it out, the theatre mu&s;t have been &s;hut up for three years, whereas no mention is made, except by this author, of its having &s;topt for a &s;ingle day.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="395">The interruption I am going to mention was not of a public nature, therefore it includes no &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the theatre. STEELE, who&s;e affairs, the larger his fortune, were ever the more perplexed, had, about 1723, &s;o got into the hands of the lawyers that every thing was in various ways made over in tru&s;t. In con&s;equence of this the theatre, which had derived great advantage from his attendance and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, be&s;ides the countenance he was enabled to procure it through the means of his fa&s;hionable con|nections, was like every thing el&s;e neglected. CIB|BER, who had born this quietly for three years, was anxious to recal him both to his duty and a due attention to his own concerns, and therefore, as there was no getting at him otherwi&s;e than officially, <Q REND="inline">"for,"</Q> &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"being in the clutches of the lawyers, the friend or the gentleman had nothing more to do in the matter,"</Q>
&s;erved him with a &s;ort of no|tice that as he had thought proper to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from the concerns, which by the articles of part|ner&s;hip he was equally bound to attend to with the re&s;t, they &s;hould expect to be paid for the trouble of doing his bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore &s;hould charge him one pound, thirteen &s;hillings, and four pence a day for their extra trouble. This was a good handle for his law friends, who having his affairs completely in their management, threw the matter immediately into Chancery.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="396">This affair came to a hearing before &s;ir JOSEPH JEKYLL, the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, in 1726. CIB|BER pleaded in behalf of him&s;elf, BOOTH, and WILKS, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed his ob&s;ervations were not more fair and manly than they were hand|&s;ome and friendly towards STEELE, even though the attornies in drawing the bill had foi&s;ted in &s;ome paltry things which reminded the other partners under what obligations they were to him from his public writings in the <HI>Tatlers,</HI> and other things, which by the way had been the original &s;ource of their grati|tude, and occa&s;ioned his being called in to make one in the management of the theatre. In &s;hort, CIB|BER pleaded &s;o effectually, that his prayer was al|lowed without the trouble and expence of a hearing before the Lord Chancellor,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and the parties were heartily glad,"</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to let this be the la&s;t of their law &s;uits."</Q></P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem as if the fate of the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> which was &s;aid to make RICH gay, and GAY rich, was to decide the fate of Drury Lane. It came out in 1728, and from that hour the other theatre went gradually to its di&s;&s;olution, I mean as to reputation, which was never revived again till GARRICK took the management. In 1729, STEELE died. Mrs. OLDEIELD died in 1730, BOOTH was
<PB N="402" REF="397">
rendered incapable of performing by his illne&s;s, Mrs. PORTER was lo&s;t to the theatre by the di&s;lo|cation of a limb, and in 1731, death took off WILKS.</P>
<P>The following year, the term for which the pa|patent had been granted expired, and CIBBER found no difficulty in getting it renewed for twenty-one years in behalf of BOOTH, Mrs. WILKS, and him&s;elf. BOOTH immediately re&s;olved to part with what he could of his &s;hare, and, finding a purcha&s;er in a gentleman of the name of HIGHMORE, who un|fortunately had attached him&s;elf to the &s;tage from having performed Lothario for his amu&s;ement, this adventurer entered into his views and gave him for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of half his proportion two thou&s;and five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>CIBBER began now to think what would be his mo&s;t politic line of conduct. Be&s;ides this Mr. HIGHMORE, who knew nothing of managing, Mrs. WILKS had put in a Mr. ELLIS to act, or rather to manage for her, who was &s;till le&s;s qualified for the ta&s;k; and, if CIBBER had found it difficult to pilot the theatrical bark through all the breezes that had been rai&s;ed by WILKS and DOGGET, who were after all expert mariners, what mu&s;t have been his trouble
<PB N="403" REF="398">
and danger to have the &s;ame ta&s;k to perform in wor&s;e weather, a&s;&s;i&s;ted only by tho&s;e who, &s;o far from being able to &s;teer, &s;carcely knew the con|&s;truction of the ve&s;&s;el in which they were embarked.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated he determined upon getting rid of the concern as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and therefore de|puted his &s;on THEOPHILUS, who he knew would be a complete torment to them, to act for him; and his fore&s;ight was &s;o correct that HIGHMORE, at the end of the &s;ea&s;on, came to him with an offer of three thou&s;and guineas for his &s;hare, which was only &s;ix hundred and twenty-five pounds more than he had paid BOOTH for half of his. CIBBER, however, was determined, as he tells us, to let it go to the highe&s;t bidder, and, therefore, clo&s;ed with the propo&s;al.</P>
<P>One rea&s;on for this, perhaps, was the ruinous &s;tate into which the theatre was likely to be plunged; which, having &s;een, he per&s;uaded Mrs. BOOTH, her hu&s;band being now dead, to get rid of the remainder of her &s;hare, with which &s;he parted upon low terms to GIFFARD. As to Mrs. WILKS &s;he was glad enough to take what &s;he could get for her proportion when FLEETWOOD came afterwards to purcha&s;e the

<PB N="404" REF="401">
property, the particulars of which we &s;hall pre|&s;ently &s;ee.</P>
<P>HIGHMORE's affairs began to wear a very alarm|ing a&s;pect. In the year 1720, a man of the name of POTTER, a carpenter, merely to plea&s;e his fancy, for it is difficult to &s;ay, unle&s;s he was in&s;pired with &s;ome of old RICH's pre&s;cience, upon what other &s;peculation he could carry &s;o expen&s;ive a plan into effect, built a theatre in the Haymarket. This the|atre had remained unoccupied thirteen years, when it &s;truck young CIBBER, that if he could per&s;uade &s;ome of the actors to revolt, they might at lea&s;t get a temporary &s;um by bringing forward &s;ome novelty at this place. The performers be founded upon this &s;ubject reli&s;hed the &s;cheme, they in&s;tantly ap|plied to POTTER, who was glad enough to turn to advantage a property that had lain &s;o long upon his hands, and in a very &s;hort time, without the &s;malle&s;t authority, opened this hou&s;e with the comedy of <HI>Love for Love,</HI> in imitation of BETTERTON and his adventurers formerly in Lincoln's Inns Fields.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t HIGHMORE did not regard this, but opened Drury Lane at the u&s;ual time. When, however, he &s;ound he could make no &s;tand again&s;t his principal actors who had now de&s;erted him, not
<PB N="405" REF="402">
even with his own performance of Lothario, his hopele&s;s condition &s;tared him in the face. He in|&s;tantly, therefore, applied to the Lord Chamberlain, and employed proper per&s;ons to put in force the laws again&s;t vagrants, but, by cunning and eva&s;ion, they contrived to hold out &s;o long; that, having but little per&s;onal intere&s;t, and very &s;oon as little per|&s;onal property, he was glad enough to give up the contention, heartily wi&s;hing he had never vainly conceived him&s;elf qualified to perform Lothario.</P>
<P>The ragged fortune of this manager was taken up by the more ragged fortune of the next, who's name was FLEETWOOD. He certainly got hold of the property at a much lower rate than any of his predece&s;&s;ors, but which property &s;unk him into more ruin, which was needle&s;s, than ever. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that he paid not more than two thou&s;and pounds for the whole property; but whatever it was, it is allowed on all hands it not only &s;tript him of his la&s;t guinea but left him con&s;iderably in debt.</P>
<P>It had one good effect however. The revolters had by this time enough of their frolic, and FLEET|WOOD, being perfectly a gentleman and a convivial character, they returned to their old quarters. With
<PB N="406" REF="403">
CIBBER, however, all idea of real management had left the theatre; be&s;ides a &s;pirit of dramatic enter|prize began now to be the rage. In 1729, a man of the name of ODELL had built a theatre in Good|man's Fields, which was attacked by the citizens, and preached again&s;t by the clergy, under the idea that it would be productive of mi&s;chief &s;o near to the &s;eat of commerce. He opened it neverthe|le&s;s, but was under the nece&s;&s;ity in a &s;hort time of &s;hutting it, though his &s;ucce&s;s had been very promi&s;ing.</P>
<P>At this time, however, GIFFARD, who had got rid of his &s;mall &s;hare in Drury Lane, &s;olicited a &s;ub|&s;cription for another theatre in Goodman's Fields, and actually opened it in 1732. RICH too, who was al&s;o determined to enterprize, was at this time building Covent Garden theatre, which opened, for the fir&s;t time in 1733. GIFFARD &s;oon after, find|ing his Goodman's Fields &s;cheme unproductive, was advi&s;ed to repair to the vacant hou&s;e in Lincoln's Inn Fields that RICH had abandoned, and he opened it in 1735, and actually without any authority, un|le&s;s there was a convention between him and RICH for the u&s;e of the dormant patent, which has been no bad &s;talking hor&s;e at times, performed there for two years.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="404">Thus in proportion as theatrical abilities de|crea&s;ed, theatres became more numerous. Covent Garden, however, with RICH and his pantomimes decidedly carried every thing before them. FLEET|WOOD, who was one of tho&s;e prodigies in life which people gaze at but cannot under&s;tand, who without a vi&s;ible &s;ixpence of his own continued to lavi&s;h away thou&s;ands, bu&s;tled on with Drury Lane for more than ten years, during all which time the the|atre continued in every di&s;tre&s;s, and laboured under every inconvenience; but what renders the circum|&s;tance &s;o extraordinary as to be &s;carcely credible is that though authors, actors, dancers, nay carpenters, &s;cene &s;hifters, dre&s;&s;ers, fire lighters, and the whole theatrical train which CIBBER enumerated in his &s;peech before the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls to the tune of a hundred and forty, be&s;ides the long li&s;t of &s;uper|numeraries, &s;carcely gleaned from the profits mo|ney &s;ufficient to &s;u&s;tain exi&s;tence, while their pro|fligate manager was figuring away and enjoying every luxury in the company of &s;ome of the fir&s;t people in the kingdom.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t have been &s;omething peculiarly faci|nating in this man. To be individually indebted to all the members of his theatre, to treat them at the &s;ame time with as much hauteur and contempt as if they
<PB N="408" REF="405">
had been his &s;laves, and contrive to make them &s;ub|mit to all this inconvenience and contumely, not only without murmuring but with chearfulne&s;s, is a trait of in&s;olent pre&s;umption on one &s;ide, and of tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the other, &s;o unaccountable, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to find a motive for it. Had there been any pro&s;pect of amendment in their fortune, had this manager in any one &s;ingle in&s;tance kept his word, or had they, in &s;hort, any thing like a glimp&s;e of hope, from inclination, if not from ability, to re|ceive the &s;malle&s;t ju&s;tice at his hands, it would have been &s;omething; but to go on earning for him the bread he eat, or rather lavi&s;hed upon others, to wit|ne&s;s every day his accumulated inconveniencies, arre&s;ts, executions, and all the horrors of legal pro|&s;ecution, and yet remain in&s;en&s;ible to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of them&s;elves and their families, and &s;till go on, would exceed credibility if we did not know that in this &s;tatement there is not the lea&s;t exaggeration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The old &s;tory is very well known about WOOD the trea&s;urer.

<P><PB N="309" REF="406">This was the time for adventurers to take the ad|vantage of the folly of Covent Garden, and the di&s;|traction of Drury Lane. Nothing of this kind, how|ever, would probably have been very formidable if the celebrated HENRY FIELDING, who became tremblingly alive to a great variety of real or imagi|nary injuries both from the great and theatrical mana|gers, had not thru&s;t him&s;elf forward and got together a &s;et of performers. He called them the Great Mo|gul's Company, and brought out <HI>ad libitum</HI> pieces at the theatre in the Haymarket.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t performance was called <HI>Pa&s;quin,</HI> which was a&s;toni&s;hingly followed for upwards of fifty nights. The piece it&s;elf we &s;hall by and by ex|amine. It was a bold, and certainly an unwarrant|able &s;atire. This was followed by the <HI>Hi&s;torical Regi&s;ter,</HI> written in the &s;ame &s;tyle of invective. The&s;e pieces were not immediately &s;topped, but they were con&s;idered of &s;uch a tendency as to de|mand an interference of the legi&s;lature; for which purpo&s;e, as the hi&s;tory is, a performance, full of the
<PB N="410" REF="407">
&s;ame per&s;onal &s;atire again&s;t the great, was anony|mou&s;ly &s;ent to GIFFARD, who had at that time re|turned to Goodman's Fields, with a private inti|mation, however, that he &s;hould refu&s;e to perform it, and give it up into the hands of government as a thing improper to bring before the public.</P>
<P>This piece was called The <HI>Golden Rump,</HI> and &s;ome think it was a &s;cheme of GIFFARD and his friends to procure favour, and perhaps a gratuity. Both the&s;e con&s;equences happened, for GIFFARD received a hand&s;ome &s;um, and was highly applauded for his con&s;titutional conduct; and, upon this ground, a bill was immediately brought into Parliament; the pre&s;ent exi&s;ting bill; which limits the num|ber of theatres, and obliges all managers to &s;ub|mit the copies of every thing dramatic to the in&s;pec|tion of a licencer.</P>
<P>As many have taken the liberty of cen&s;uring this mea&s;ure, con&s;cious, probably, that their own writings could not &s;tand a te&s;t which would weed them of licentiou&s;ne&s;s and immorality, it is a proper thing here to &s;hew that there was nothing novel in this proceeding, but the manner of its being regulated into a po&s;itive law. Tho&s;e who have looked over this hi&s;tory will &s;ee that the power of the Lord
<PB N="411" REF="408">
Chamberlain had always at lea&s;t this operation, and STOW entered into it &s;o much with the &s;ame &s;pirit, and the &s;ame under&s;tanding of the &s;ubject, that no|thing new could, during the contention, or can now, be offered to alter the que&s;tion, or to re&s;ute the pro|priety of the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>My Lord CHESTERFIELD, that public moralizer and private advocate for every thing wicked and pro|fligate, certainly &s;poke again&s;t the que&s;tion; and with all the flimzy &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s with which it was his cu&s;tom to glo&s;s over rotten arguments, affected to tremble at the blow about to be given to our liber|ties through an act meant to re&s;train authors and actors within tho&s;e limits which, were they not ob|&s;erved, would be a di&s;grace to them and to &s;ociety. Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and its concommitant, &s;edition, are the bane of literature in this country, and no hone&s;t writer will ever murmur at their being kept within their proper bounds.</P>
<P>No man in his &s;en&s;es can deny that the mea&s;ure was perfectly nece&s;&s;ary. If it was con&s;idered as a &s;tretch of power, at different periods, to &s;u&s;pend the theatre for a time on account of impropriety of con|duct in authors, actors, or managers, it became high time for that power to be regulated and receive a le|gal
<PB N="412" REF="409">
&s;anction. The exerci&s;e of the power according to circum&s;tances had never been altered nor di&s;puted. The <HI>Maid's Tragedy, Lucius Junius Brutus,</HI> DRY|DEN's Prologue to the <HI>Prophete&s;s, Mary Queen of Scots,</HI> and a variety of other things had been refu&s;ed licences. This is a proof that licences were a&s;ked for, and that this was u&s;ual, otherwi&s;e they could not have been refu&s;ed. All, therefore, that was now done went no farther than to con&s;olidate a whole&s;ome cu&s;tom &s;anctioned by &s;everal local laws into one ef|fectual law; the fact remained exactly as before. The conduct of the Lord Chamberlain, which crafty men cho&s;e, prior to this act, to repre&s;ent as unde|finable, was now preci&s;ely fixed and &s;ettled, and in &s;uch a way that no per&s;on could from that time affect to mi&s;under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>Nothing can prove this more clearly than the fact already hinted at, of TONY ASTON's having been admitted to &s;peak upon a &s;imilar act, which had been moved for, two years earlier, before FIELD|ING brought out <HI>Pa&s;quin</HI>; and this &s;hews, by the way, that the mini&s;try wanted no &s;uch &s;timulus as <HI>Pa&s;quin,</HI> or The <HI>Hi&s;torical Regi&s;ter,</HI> or The <HI>Golden Rump</HI>; and that it was the opening of the theatre in the Haymarket and that in Goodman's Fields, in de|fiance of all law, that was con&s;idered as the offence rather than any &s;trictures on his per&s;onal conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="410">The fact is, grievanees had always exi&s;ted; we &s;ee them in this hi&s;tory frequently and variou&s;ly enu|merated, and an attempt to get rid of them, and to &s;hew the public at once, and the different members of theatres, the proper regulations on which they either could or ought to be carried on, was as much a compliment to tho&s;e intere&s;ted in them. as it was a mea&s;ure due to the dignity of the law. The dif|ficult lay in con&s;tructing &s;uch an act as &s;hould be &s;hielded from all mi&s;con&s;truction, and this they had not properly con&s;idered in the fir&s;t act they brought in; which, as we have &s;een, was got rid of through the arguments of TONY ASTON, and this is a &s;trong proof how de&s;irous the mini&s;try were of not infring|ing upon e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;age.</P>
<P>This man was bred a lawyer, and the &s;tudy of his life had been to watch tho&s;e laws concerning theatres, and for the mo&s;t natural rea&s;on in the world. He was him&s;elf a vagrant, and was perpetually &s;etting the laws at defiance. His hone&s;t expo&s;ition, there|fore, of the manner in which he had evaded them was the be&s;t le&s;&s;on that could be how to frame &s;uch a law as no man could po&s;&s;ibly evade. This he con|vinced them they had not been able to do, for he pointed out &s;o many loop holes in the bill they brought in, that they took it back and two years af|terwards pa&s;&s;ed this in que&s;tion; which, through
<PB N="414" REF="411">
tho&s;e hints, and upon mature con&s;ideration they con+ceived liable to no further objection.</P>
<P>In this they were perfectly right, for nothing but cavil has been levelled again&s;t it, and this &s;hews that TONY ASHTON was a better, or lea&s;t an hone&s;ter, parliamentary &s;peaker than Lord CHESTERFIELD; for TONY, having evaded the law, fairly &s;hewed in what manner he had done &s;o, and acknowledged the new act as a &s;alutary mea&s;ure, to pre&s;ent eva&s;ion in others; while my Lord &s;hirked the que&s;tion, and af|fected to lament future con&s;equences that could have no po&s;&s;ible operation, for fear, perhaps, the li|centiou&s;ne&s;s of writers &s;hould receive whole&s;ome re&s;traint.</P>
<P>As there had been nothing like management &s;ince CIBBER, RICH alone through his foreign levies was &s;ucce&s;sful. The re&s;t, branching into different factions became weakened and irregular. We have &s;een GIFFARD open and &s;hut his theatre in Good|man's Fields as he was impelled by difference of for|tune, and we have &s;een FIELDING oppo&s;e theatres, and mini&s;ters, with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s for one &s;ea&s;on, and &s;ink into nothing the year following. FLEET|WOOD, who with all his companionable qualities, and adroitne&s;s in pocketing the receipts of the hou&s;e, would have found them &s;o unproductive as to have
<PB N="415" REF="412">
had nothing to pocket, had he not called in a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance as to the management.</P>
<P>The theatre would not have bettered its &s;ucce&s;s however by this &s;tep, had not MACKLIN been cho|&s;en one of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants; who paid the &s;ame atten|tion to the real intere&s;t of the concern as his coad|jutor young CIBBER did to the frippery and decora|tions; and, though no material advantage imme|diately accrued from his judgment in the &s;election of proper performers, yet it begat a &s;ort of dawn or promi&s;e of another era, likely to be as pre-eminently great as that in which the &s;tage had been &s;up|ported by tho&s;e actors who&s;e ab&s;ence the town now very ju&s;tly and very &s;incerely regretted.</P>
<P>QUIN began now to be known, and MILWARD; and Mrs. CIBBER, who had been a favourite &s;inger, all of a &s;udden a&s;toni&s;hed the public by her admira|ble performance of Zara. And now the licening act being pa&s;&s;ed, and theatrical merit confined to one point, many candidates for public &s;avour made their appearance; till, at length, to &s;anction their labours and confirm their reputation, the world were a&s;to|ni&s;hed and delighted with a new and extraordinary object of theatrical excellence, in GARRICK.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. ACTORS.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY thing that relates to genius and mental intelli|gence, is both a&s;certained and improved by compari|&s;on. Thus authors and actors have &s;ucceeded be&s;t when they have appeared in clu&s;ters. We &s;ay the wits of ELIZABETH, and the wits of CHARLES the &s;econd, and upon the &s;ame principle, ju&s;t as we now lament that there remain very few members of the &s;chool of GARRICK, &s;o in CIBBER's time, at lea&s;t after 1708, they began to deplore the decline of the &s;chool of BETTERTON.</P>
<P>We have &s;een already that acting, after that great man, relaxed as a repre&s;entation of nature, and that WILKS and CIBBER, who were not gifted actors, intuitive utterers of pa&s;&s;ion and &s;en&s;ibility, &s;up|plied the&s;e requi&s;ites by &s;ound judgment, and &s;trong di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>WILKS was an Iri&s;hman and had never dreamt
<PB N="4I7" REF="414">
of being an actor, but had drudged on in the Secre|tary of State's office, till &s;ome private per&s;ons gave a play gratis. The play was <HI>Othello,</HI> and WILKS acted the Moor; from which moment, though he was con&s;cious how many di&s;advantages he had to &s;truggle with, he determined to quit his &s;ituation, by which his &s;ucce&s;&s;or acquired a fortune of fifty thou&s;and pounds, and attach him&s;elf wholly to the &s;tage.</P>
<P>With a view of getting at once into fame, he came to ENGLAND, but, being neglected for a con|&s;iderable time, he could not brook like CIBBER this inaction, and contumely, and, therefore, returned to DUBLIN, where having gained experience, he once more came to ENGLAND, and, an opportunity being now open to him, by poor MONTFORD's unfortu|nate death, of trying his fortune, he began &s;oon to be received by the public as a very &s;en&s;ible if not a very excellent actor. I have &s;hewn how completely he overpowered POWELL merely by diligence and attention<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>CIBBER tells us that WILKS con&s;idered this diligence as &s;o in|di&s;pen&s;ible a duty to the public, that he &s;eemed to love it as good men do virtue for its own &s;ake; for that he has known him &s;wallow a volume of froth and in&s;ipidity in a new play, which had no merit but being recommended by a per&s;on of quality, and would not live three nights. He gives among &s;everal in&s;tances of WILKS's extra|ordinary patience in this way, the following example.</P>
<P>In &s;ome new comedy, he happened to complain of a crabbed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;peech in his part, which",</Q> he &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"gave him more trouble to &s;tudy, than all the re&s;t of it had done; upon which, he applied to the author, either to &s;often, or &s;horten it. The author, that he might make the matter quite ea&s;y to him, fairly cut it all out. But when he got home, from the rehear&s;al, WILKS thought it &s;uch an indignity to his memory that any thing &s;hould be thought too hard for it, that he actually made him&s;elf perfect in that &s;peech, though he knew it was never to be made u&s;e of. From this &s;ingular act of &s;upererogation, you may judge, how indefatigable the labour of his memory mu&s;t have been, when his profit and honour were more concerned to make u&s;e of it."</Q></P></NOTE>. But I mu&s;t confine my&s;elf to WILKS as an actor.</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="415">WILKS &s;eems to have had many radical imper|fections, like CIBBER, which he was obliged to &s;often, and conceal by various arts. The&s;e arts at la&s;t became a &s;tandard, and have ever &s;ince been re|forted to by all tho&s;e who&s;e merit, as actors have been derived from information, under&s;tanding, and a &s;trong comprehen&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;ions and their motives; but to whom nature has denied either per&s;on or voice, or &s;ome other of tho&s;e prominent requi&s;ites without which an actor, with the be&s;t conception, mu&s;t have to &s;truggle again&s;t the &s;tream; ju&s;t as CHURCHILL complains that O'BRIEN croaked becau&s;e WOOD|WARD had croaked before, and thus we find RYAN, HAVARD, and even the erudite and valuable SHE|RIDAN,
<PB N="419" REF="416">
all manneri&s;ts in this way who were obliged in the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e primary and e&s;&s;ential quali|ties to &s;ub&s;titute &s;y&s;tem for nature.</P>
<P>WILKS, in this way, is repre&s;ented as having an inharmonious voice, which obliged him, when he gave a loo&s;e to that &s;pirit which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an uncommon degree, to cut his accents &s;hort and ren|der that ri&s;ible that ought to have been &s;olemn, and mimickry which was intended for humour. All this, however, he &s;o corrected and took &s;uch indefatigable pains to conquer, that, as it gradually reduced and the public became gradually acquainted with it, he was at la&s;t con&s;idered as a perfect actor, and it was agreed, by the time his friend FARQUHAR wrote <HI>Sir Harry Wildair,</HI> that acting had never been &s;uperior to WILKS; forgetting that cu&s;tom will vitiate the public under&s;tanding, and make that appear at one time delectable, that at another would have been only endurable; which is only &s;aying, of the period of which we are now &s;peaking, that, at the time of BETTERTON, acting was far &s;uperior to what it was in the time of CIBBER, and, in the time of GAR|RICK, to what it is at the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>To &s;hew, however, that it is extremely difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h real merit, and a correct ta&s;te in the
<PB N="420" REF="417">
public to reli&s;h and reward it, and that the verna|cular excellence in acting, which &s;eems to run in veins as the different &s;trata in mines, was yet known and practi&s;ed, it had certainly de&s;cended from BET|TERTON to BOOTH. When Sir RICHARD STEELE read a part of <HI>Cato</HI> to CIBBER, &s;even years before it was acted, and when BOOTH was about nineteen, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good GOD,"</Q> exclaimed he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what a part would BETTERTON have made of Cato!"</Q>
BOOTH, who had paid every attention both privately and publicly to the in&s;tructions of BETTERTON, made a fortune by this very part.</P>
<P>This actor, added to the great natural requi&s;ites of a fine per&s;on, a good voice, and a graceful and dig|nified deportment, the advantages derived from a &s;ound under&s;tanding, and a cla&s;&s;ical education. His &s;tyle of acting was altogether tragedy, in which, however, he is &s;aid to have in &s;ome degree cramped nature by lacing the bu&s;kin too tight. This, how|ever, only appeared upon a compari&s;on with BET|TERTON, for BOOTH had &s;trong &s;terling merit, and no doubt contributed a great deal towards keeping the more dignified parts of the drama in that e&s;timable re&s;pect which con&s;titutes its be&s;t reputation.</P>
<P>DOGGET, as we are informed from good and im|partial authority, was the mo&s;t original and the &s;tricte&s;t
<PB N="421" REF="418">
ob&s;erver of nature of all the actors then living. He was ridiculous without impropriety, he had a dif|ferent look for every different kind of humour, and, though he was an excellent mimic, he imitated no|thing but nature. In comic &s;ongs and dances he was admirable; and, if the de&s;cription of his per|formance of Ben in <HI>Love for Love</HI> be correct, that part has certainly never been performed &s;ince to any degree of perfection. He was a great ob&s;erver of nature, and particularly delighted at catching the manners in low life, as CONGREVE is &s;aid to have gone to Wapping to write <HI>Ben,</HI> GAY to Newgate to furni&s;h his <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> or as SWIFT u&s;ed to li&s;ten for hours to the low Iri&s;h; but, with all this, the acting of DOGGET was &s;o cha&s;te, and his man|ners in private life &s;o well bred, that, though he never cho&s;e to be the actor any where but on the &s;tage, yet his company was warmly &s;ought after by per&s;ons of rank and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>ESTCOURT, who was born at Tewk&s;bury, had from his infancy a ta&s;te for acting, and particularly mimickry. At fifteen he ran away from his friends and was caught by his father in the very act of per|forming Roxana at Worce&s;ter. He was &s;o dread|fully alarmed that he borrowed &s;ome cloaths of one of the itinerent ladies and in&s;tantly left Alexander to
<PB N="422" REF="419">
his fate; nor did he &s;top till he reached Chipping Norton; where, beds being &s;carce, he was obliged to take up with that of the daughter at the inn. who undertook to &s;it up; but, finding her&s;elf fleepy, and not conceiving there would be any po&s;&s;ible harm in going to bed to one of her own &s;ex, was on the point of vi&s;iting ESTCOURT, who was fa&s;t a&s;leep, had &s;he not by &s;ome means di&s;covered her error.</P>
<P>The poor comedian was now taken for a thief, and upon the point of being conveyed to a hor&s;e pond, when a per&s;on from his father, who had en|quired his track, entered the hou&s;e, &s;atisfied the landlord, and conveyed the young gentleman home.</P>
<P>He was now bound apprentice, but nothing could hold him, and he took a &s;peedy opportunity of going to Ireland, where he was received on the &s;tage, and &s;oon made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s. CIB|BER &s;ays he was &s;o amazing and extraordinary a mimic, that no man nor woman, from the coquette to the privy councellor, ever moved or &s;poke be|fore him, that he could not carry their voice, look. mein, and motion, in&s;tantly into another company, But this, however, was the boundary of his merit; and though he is &s;aid to have on the part of Fal&s;taff written notes and ob&s;ervations upon every
<PB N="423" REF="420">
&s;peech, de&s;cribing the true &s;pirit of the humour, and the tone, look, and ge&s;ture with which it ought to be delivered; yet, when he came on the &s;tage, there was a flatne&s;s and an in&s;ipidity, in his acting that &s;hewed he could greatly conceive, but had not the power to execute. Great mimics, however, are never great actors, and the rea&s;on is obvious as daylight. Mimicry is an imitation of particular men, and, therefore, vapid and full of pecularity. Acting is an imitation of all mankind, and, there|fore, intere&s;ting and full of nature; or, in other words, nothing is &s;o erroneous as to hit manners through men, whereas nothing is &s;o &s;ure as to hit men through manners.</P>
<P>ESTCOURT, however, was as great a character, with the golden gridiron round his neck at the Beef Steak Club, as he was in&s;ignificant, con&s;idering his general talents, on the &s;tage, and that he was hu|mane, poli&s;hed, and witty, STEELE has given a mo&s;t friendly and eloquent certificate, by his charming and manly eulogium of this popular favourite in the <HI>Tatler.</HI></P>
<P>NORRIS, who&s;e mother was the earlie&s;t Engli&s;h actre&s;s, and who we have already known by the title of Jubilee Dicky, mu&s;t have been as well as NOKES
<PB N="424" REF="421">
an actor like WESTON. Unconcious him&s;elf that he did any thing more than utter his audiences were con&s;tantly in a roar. In all characters of in|veterate &s;implicity, he was exactly what he repre|&s;ented; but we are told he &s;eemed mo&s;t particu|larly formed to repre&s;ent a cuckold. CIBBER once performed Barnaby Brittle and a&s;ked Mrs. OLD|FIELD, who acted the wife, how &s;he liked him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Not half &s;o well as NORRIS,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he looks ten times more like a cuckold than you do."</Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, a large number might be enu|merated and every one entitled to &s;ome particular prai&s;e. KEEN was a very re&s;pectable actor, &s;o was MILWARD; GRIFFITH has claims to commenda|tion, &s;o had BROWN, &s;o had CROSS, &s;o had TRE|FUSIS, which la&s;t was the original Sir SAMPSON LEGEND. The elder and younger MILLS, and many others, which the dramatis per&s;onae of the tra|gedies and comedies then brought out, will di&s;|tingui&s;h, and many on whom I &s;hall further enlarge hereafter, &s;uch as QUIN and RYAN, had at that time &s;tarted on the theatrical cour&s;e and began a very creditable career, but at be&s;t they cannot, whatever was their diligence, their propriety, their proper at|tention to the plea&s;ure of the public, and their own reputation, &s;tand again&s;t the galaxy of talents com|compo&s;ed by BETTERTON and his &s;atelites.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="422">All the&s;e remarks, with very little exception, ap|ply to the females. Mrs. BOOTH, Mrs. PORTER, and others were imitators of Mrs. BARRY, Mrs. BETTERTON, and the re&s;t. It would be inju&s;tice, however, not to mention Mrs. OLDFIELD who was a wonderful acqui&s;ition to the theatre, and in par|ticular, becau&s;e her talents were &s;o diver&s;ified.</P>
<P>This actre&s;s &s;eems to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome portion of every requi&s;ite that characterized the merit of the old &s;chool. Her performance embraced almo&s;t every de&s;cription of tragedy and comedy. She, like mo&s;t of the female performers who have arrived to great excellence, continued for a time unheeded. FARQUHAR who heard her by accident reading a play expre&s;&s;ed great a&s;toni&s;hment at the propriety with which &s;he intere&s;ted his feelings, and pronouned her formed by nature for an actre&s;s, which opinion was &s;trongly confirmed when he found her in the bloom of youth, and full of grace, elegance and beauty.</P>
<P>WILKS, FARQUHAR's particular friend, was then in IRELAND; he, however, recommended her in very warm terms to VANBRUGH, who engaged her; but it was not till after &s;he had performed three or four parts that the town, or the performers
<PB N="426" REF="423">
perceived in her &s;ymtoms of extraordinary merit. CIBBER him&s;elf, who was certainly not only a con|&s;ummate judge, but who was of cour&s;e catching at every opportunity to embelli&s;h his own plays with the be&s;t talents the theatre had to boa&s;t, confe&s;&s;es he thought very little of her till &s;he performed Leonora in <HI>Sir Courtly Nice,</HI> a character after all not very ad|vantageous to the performer. He &s;ays that even in that, when &s;he rehear&s;ed with him, he had but a poor opinion of her, but having opportunity of paying her attention, her &s;cenes lying almo&s;t entirely with him, &s;he not only &s;urprized him in her own acting, but animated him into a &s;tyle of acting him&s;elf that both delighted and a&s;toni&s;hed him.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this he determined to fini&s;h The <HI>Carele&s;s Hu&s;band,</HI> which had lain by &s;ome time for want of a Lady Betty Modi&s;h, and he was after|wards proud to own that the great and extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s that piece met with was principally owing to this admirable actre&s;s. It was very hand&s;ome and very honourable to pay this tribute to her public merit; but, having through this di&s;covery found out al&s;o that her private worth and accompli&s;hments were as great and extraordinary, he takes an honoura|ble plea&s;ure in adding that he has &s;een her in private &s;ocieties where people of the fir&s;t rank and di&s;tinction,

<P>MANY and very &s;ufficient authorities may be quoted to prove that in IRELAND as in ENGLAND the dra|matic art was known very early. Every ancient and noble family had its bard, the kings had their poet laureats, and the&s;e poets were held for their wi&s;dom and genius in &s;uch high e&s;timation that they occupied &s;eats in the triennial councils, as the following tran|&s;lation from the original Iri&s;h will prove.<Q><L>The King was &s;eated on a royal throne,</L>
<L>And on his face maje&s;tic greatne&s;s &s;hone.</L>
<L>Around him, &s;ummoned by his &s;trict command,</L>
<L>The peers, the prie&s;ts, the commons of the land,</L>
<L>The bards, or poets, are allowed a place,</L>
<L>And men of learning the a&s;&s;embly grace.</L></Q> And, further on, we are told what was the employ|ment of a poet.<Q><L>Poets are to applaud, or boldly blame,</L>
<L>And ju&s;tly to give infamy, or fame.</L>
<L><PB N="429" REF="426">For without them, the brighte&s;t laurels fade,</L>
<L>And daring vice is in oblivion laid.</L></Q> And thus we have the principles of the Grecian drama adopted in IRELAND long before the in|cur&s;ions of the Danes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>But it is a&s;toni&s;hing to what a remote period we may carry back Iri&s;h learning if hi&s;tory is to be credited. The Iri&s;h Hi&s;tory informs us, that Prince GADELUS, of the Mile&s;ian race, in his travels vi&s;ited PHARAOH, king of EGYPT, fell in love with SCOTA, the king's daughter, and married her. This GADELUS, or GAD|DEL, for the royal records of TARAH call him by both names, in EGYPT was &s;tung by a &s;erpent as he lay a&s;leep, and was healed by the prophet MOSES. The Iri&s;h is thus elegantly tran&s;lated by a native bard.<Q><L>The hi&s;&s;ing &s;erpent, eager for his prey,</L>
<L>A&s;cends the couch where &s;leeping GADEL lay:</L>
<L>In winding mazes there him&s;elf he roll'd,</L>
<L>And leap'd upon him with a dreadful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">old,</L>
<L>And &s;hook his forked tongue, and then around.</L>
<L>His neck he twi&s;ts, and gave a deadly wound.</L>
<L>The &s;ubtle poi&s;on &s;preads thro' ev'ry vein;</L>
<L>No art, no juice of herbs, can ea&s;e the pain;</L>
<L>Till MOSES, with his never-failing wand,</L>
<L>Touch'd the raw wound, which heal'd at his command.</L></Q></P>

<P>When GADELUS, with his wife SCOTA, from this prince&s;s IRE|LAND was fir&s;t called SCOTA, and his followers, were leaving EGYPT to &s;ettle in &s;ome new colony, the following prophecy was declared by MOSES, tran&s;lated by the &s;ame elegant hand.<Q><L>The holy prophet was in&s;pir'd, to &s;ee</L>
<L>Into events of dark &s;aturity:</L>
<L>And &s;aid, for thee, young prince, has Heav'n in &s;tore</L>
<L>Ble&s;&s;ings, that mortals ne'er enjoy'd before.</L>
<L>From who&s;oe'er the royal line &s;hall come,</L>
<L>Fruitful &s;hall be their land, and &s;afe their home;</L>
<L>No poi&s;onous &s;nake or &s;erpent &s;hall deface</L>
<L>The beauty of the fields, or taint the gra&s;s;</L>
<L>No noi&s;ome reptile, with invenom'd teeth,</L>
<L>Shall ever &s;well that land, or be the cau&s;e of death.</L>
<L>But innocence and arts &s;hall flouri&s;h there,</L>
<L>And learning in its lovely &s;hapes appear:</L>

in DUBLIN, when BLOUNT, Lord Mountjoy, was Lord Lieutenant towards the latter end of Queen ELIZABETH's reign. Of this there are various proofs but it does not appear that there was any e&s;ta|bli&s;hed theatre till 1635, when the Earl of STRAF|FORD was viceroy, and it &s;hould &s;eem that this is very probably the fact, becau&s;e OGILBY, hi&s;toriogra|pher to the king, was made the fir&s;t Ma&s;ter of the Revels in the kingdom of IRELAND.</P>
<P>This theatre was built in Warburgh-&s;treet, where a regular company of actors continued to repre&s;ent the celebrated pieces of that time, till 1641; when, upon the breaking out of the rebellion, all amu&s;e|ments were of cour&s;e &s;u&s;pended, and we hear no|thing more of the theatre till 1661, when a new one
<PB N="431" REF="428">
was built in Smock Alley, at the in&s;tance, in &s;ome mea&s;ure as it &s;hould &s;eem of the famous CATHERINE PHILLIPS, the famed Orinda, or the Engli&s;h Sapho, as we have &s;een her already variou&s;ly called, her tragedy of <HI>Pompey</HI> having been fir&s;t performed there from which circum&s;tance it is facetiou&s;ly &s;aid by &s;ome authors, the place took that name, it having been before that time called Orange &s;treet.</P>
<P>In 1671 part of the theatre in Smock Alley fell down, and it does not appear that any other was e&s;tabli&s;hed till &s;ome time after the Revolu|tion, when it &s;o happened that ASHBURY, the Ma&s;ter of the Revels, was not only de&s;irous of encouraging acting, but was a very good actor him|&s;elf; for, in 1691, in a new theatre built upon the ruins of the old one, we find him performing Iago, and in&s;tructing a number of young actor, among whom were WILKS, BOOTH, KEEN, ESTCOURT, NORRIS, GRIFFITH, BOWEN, CROSS, and TRE|FUSIS. The actre&s;&s;es I apprehend were not capital, for I don't find that any of them cro&s;&s;ed the Shannon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. ASHBURY from his infancy had a talent for acting. He tought queen ANNE, when &s;he was only prince&s;s, the part of Semandra in <HI>Mithridates, King of Pontus,</HI> which was pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="5+ letters"> at the Banquet|ing hou&s;e at Whitehall, by per&s;ons of rank. Mr. ASHBURY con|ducted the whole, and from this circum&s;tance he obtained his &s;itua|tion as Ma&s;ter of the Revels in Ireland.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="429">Thus the Iri&s;h theatre, though &s;o recently e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, we find under a mo&s;t able ma&s;ter, which ASHBURY is allowed to have been, became all at once a nur&s;ery for the Engli&s;h theatres, and it is very probable, after the meridian excellence of BETTERTON, and the di&s;traction into which RICH threw Engli&s;h theatricals, that the &s;tage would have dwindled away for want of actors had not &s;o lucky an occa&s;ion pre&s;ented it&s;elf, as that a Ma&s;ter of the Revels, and a man of fortune, &s;hould not only con|&s;ider acting as a laudable, and meritorious employ|ment, but become an actor him&s;elf, and induce his wife to follow his example, in order to give a con|&s;equence to that profe&s;&s;ion of which he was the pa|tron and protector.</P>
<P>This very advantageous circum&s;tance, however, happening, men of better fortune and more liberal education, attached them&s;elves to the &s;tage than would have done had the director been merely an adventurer. BOOTH was born of an honourable family in Lanca&s;hire, and brought up at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, and it was with &s;ome difficulty he could get
<PB N="433" REF="430">
on the &s;tage by the con&s;ent of his connections, and if it had not been for the example of ASHBURY it is more than probable he never would been an actor. WILKS, who&s;e grandfather was the famous judge of that name, may be de&s;cribed in the &s;ame manner, and this being applicable to many of the others, we &s;ee a whole play &s;upplied by the very names of men who mere &s;erving an apprentice&s;hip under ASHBURY in DUBLIN, and who afterwards came forward as ma&s;ters in LONDON.</P>
<P>ASHBURY continued patentee of this exclu&s;ive theatre till 1720, when he died at the age of eighty-two, and retained his judgement and faculties to the la&s;t moment of his life. He had been Ma&s;ter of the Revels to CHARLES the &s;econd, WILLIAM the third, queen ANNE, and GEORGE the fir&s;t, and this, of cour&s;e, accounts for there having been no other theatre during all that period.</P>
<P>After the death of ASHBURY a relaxation in the duty of Ma&s;ter of the Revels threw the &s;tage into di&s;repute, and different noblemen a&s;&s;umed a right to give licences within their liberties, and extraneous entertainments were introduced by foreigners. A certain Signora VIOLANTE, in 1732, opened a kind of booth which at length grew into a theatre. She
<PB N="434" REF="431">
began with po&s;turing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Madame ISABELLA became here a terrible &s;acrifice to this &s;hocking method of diverting an audience. She was born in Italy, &s;prung from a noble family in the city of Florence. She was put into a nunnery at twelve years of age, in order to take the veil; but a po&s;ture-ma&s;ter unluckily came to that city, gained her affections, and found means to carry her off, and married her; he in&s;tructed her in this un&s;eemingly and dangerous employment, and brought her to England; where Lady ISABELLA was greatly admired, for her po&s;tures, and &s;eats of activity. The la&s;t, and fatal, time of her performance, &s;he was eight months gone with-child; but the covetous hu&s;band loved money &s;o well, as it is reported, that he would not allow her the nece&s;&s;ary repo&s;e required in her condition; &s;o that, in one of her dances on a &s;lack rope, &s;he fell on the &s;tage, where the mother and infant, newly born with the force of the fall, expired in a moment, fatal cata&s;trophe! in her twenty-fir&s;t year of her age. This was the running account of the poor Lady ISABELLA after her death, who&s;e end was much lamented; for, notwith&s;tand|ing her di&s;reputable employment, &s;he was e&s;teemed as a woman of &s;trict virtue.</NOTE>, went on with prize-fighting, then with pantomiming, and fini&s;hed with plays, for BARRINGTON, NORRIS, BEAMSLY, Mrs. WOF|FINGTON, and Mrs. MICHEL, appeared originally among this heterogeneous medley, till at length it was di&s;covered that &s;he had no licence, and &s;ome years afterwards her theatre was converted into a Lying-in-Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>During the la&s;t two years that Madame VIO|LANTE's theatre continued open, for I believe &s;he
<PB N="435" REF="432">
did not reign more than five years in all. It was farmed by SPARKS BARRINGTON, and Mi&s;s MAC|KAY, afterwards Mrs. MITCHEL, for three pounds a week, and it was this lady's benefit which was patro|nized by the people of fa&s;hion that conjured up a &s;pirit of re&s;entment in the old Smock-alley mana|gers, which induced an application to the Lord Mayor of DUBLIN, and through which they were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>My Lord MEATH, however, gave an authority to this &s;ame company with an actor of the name of HUSBAND at their head to build in his liberties, and in con&s;equence a theatre very &s;oon opened in Ransford-&s;treet, which mu&s;t have been about the year 1737. It &s;hould have been known, however, that Smock alley had three years before that a much more formidable rival. The Duke of DOR|SET laid the fir&s;t &s;tone of a theatre in Aungier-&s;treet, which opened early in 1734.</P>
<P>Smock-alley &s;eems to have gone on with the be&s;t regulations, and to have reaped the greate&s;t profit. Aungier-&s;treet, and Ransford &s;treet op|po&s;ed each other in various ways, having recour&s;e to &s;pectacle, which &s;eemed to be all upon a par

<P>To the&s;e theatres &s;ucceeded a hou&s;e in Capel-&s;treet, Punch's theatre, and &s;ometime afterwards a playhou&s;e in Crow-&s;treet, but as I am now forward enough to prove how far the Iri&s;h theatre a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Engli&s;h up to that period I &s;hall not take it up again till I &s;hew in what way we are obliged to it, for QUIN, Mrs. WOFFINGTON, and many other per|formers who joined the grand army of theatrical heroes under GARRICK.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. MUSIC, THE OPERA, AND OTHER RELATIVE PAR|TICULARS.</HEAD>
<P>WE left the &s;ubject of mu&s;ic at the time when it was ripe for the improvements of PURCELL, LAWES, and tho&s;e other admirable compo&s;ers who followed ORLANDO GIBBONS, and the &s;chool in which he &s;tudied, and which had imbibed enough of Italian ta&s;te to poli&s;h the bold and natural character of En|gli&s;h melody, without de&s;troying its vernacular effect.</P>
<P>At the Re&s;toration, mu&s;ic, which had &s;truggled like every thing el&s;e during the troubles, began to renovate. One of the fir&s;t mea&s;ures taken by CHARLES the &s;econd was to form the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a choir in the Chapel Royal, and CHILD, GIB|BONS, and LOW, were appointed the organi&s;ts, and COOK was ma&s;ter of the children. The &s;alaries at this time were con&s;iderably augmented as an en|couragement to the profe&s;&s;ors, and every other &s;tep
<PB N="438" REF="435">
was taken to give dignity and con&s;equence to a &s;cience, that CHARLES indeed had but little ta&s;te for, except &s;uch mu&s;ic as excited mirth, but that he knew it would be both gratifying and advantageous to encourage, and this politic judgment of his was &s;o correct, that all the choirs in the kingdom in|&s;tantly felt the good effects of this arrangement.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic, however, was not confined to the church. It had always been a cu&s;tom, as we have &s;een, to entertain companies at private hou&s;es with min&s;trel&s;y but mu&s;ic in parts being now brought to great per|fection, concerts were &s;et forward; to no great ef|fect, however, till a man of the name of BRITTON, a mo&s;t &s;ingular in&s;tance of natural endowment, who attained to perfection every thing he &s;tudied, and who &s;eems to have had a mo&s;t &s;cientific mind, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, under very forbidding circum&s;tances, a re|gular concert.</P>
<P>This BRITTON, a &s;mall coal-man, in an ob&s;cure part of the town, difficult of acce&s;s, in a room with|out ornament or accommodation, and more like a pri&s;on than a receptacle for decent auditors, attracted all the fa&s;hion of the age, who &s;locked regularly every week to ta&s;te a delight of which the Engli&s;h were now &s;o particulary fond, that it was con&s;idered
<PB N="439" REF="436">
as vulgar then not to have attended BRITTON's concert, as it would be now not to have heard BANTI.</P>
<P>This concert continued from 1678 to 1714, during which period at different times it received per&s;ons of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction, and performers of the highe&s;t eminence. The movements of mu&s;ic began now to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, and cla&s;&s;ed; their wildne&s;s and irregularity corrected; the jig, the gavot, and the minuet, a&s;certained; and every ad|vantage given that was nece&s;&s;ary to blend nature and regularity, and &s;uch men as BANISTER, and LOCK, who &s;eized the opportunity of giving mu&s;ic that theatrical effect it had benefited by in ITALY, fixed a &s;ort of familiar criterion which won upon every mind, and converted that to magic which had before been only gratification.</P>
<P>I cannot give a &s;tronger proof of this than the mu&s;ic of Macbeth, which was compo&s;ed by LOCK for D'AVENANT. The Engli&s;h &s;pectator at this moment knows and admits it &s;uperior merit, and I fancy it will be difficult to point out any thing, as far as it goes, that boa&s;ts more &s;terling excellence. BANISTER had at that time compo&s;ed <HI>Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters"></HI> with &s;ome reputation; but, when PERCELL began to at|tract
<PB N="440" REF="437">
public attention by the compo&s;ition of <HI>Dido,</HI> the words of DRYDEN's beautiful epitaph on that great man &s;hews that he repeated no more than the truth for his competitors
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;ung no more, or only &s;ung his fame."</Q></P>
<P>LEE's <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> DRYDEN's <HI>King Arthur,</HI> BET|TERTON's <HI>Prophete&s;s,</HI> SHAKESPEAR's <HI>Mid&s;ummer Night's Dream,</HI> and a prodigious number of other dramatic pieces, which PURCELL embelli&s;hed with his compo&s;itions, gave theatrical mu&s;ic &s;o decided a &s;uperiority over every thing, even the Italian the|atre, for ITALY had not yet been greatly celebrated except for its wonderful church mu&s;ic, and the grandeur of opera &s;tyle, that this extraordinary and in&s;pired compo&s;er mo&s;t opportunely &s;hone out a mu&s;ical AESCHYLUS.</P>
<P>This will &s;hew, however the Italian &s;chool mu&s;t be for ever con&s;idered as the true &s;ource for all that is great and dignified in mu&s;ic, that it is only to be re&s;orted to as a kind of educaion, which corrects ignorance, rubs off the hardne&s;&s;es of crude concep|tions, and gives a poli&s;h and a ta&s;te, but can never confer genius; and it is upon this principle that every dramatic writer would rather be a SHAKES|PEAR than a JONSON, and every dramatic compo&s;er
<PB N="441" REF="438">
a PURCELL, or an ARNE, than a BONONCINI, or even a HANDEL.</P>
<P>I thought it material to give this &s;trong proof that mu&s;ic, upon fair, meritorious, and natural ground, obtained with great reputation and re&s;pectability before the introduction of the Italian opera. The Engli&s;h air has a very peculiar character, which I will venture to &s;ay has never been felt, and, there|fore, could never have been compo&s;ed, but by Engli&s;hmen, and I appeal to every man of natural ta&s;te in the kingdom, even though I involve the great HANDEL in the controver&s;y, whether Engli&s;h words have ever been &s;et, &s;o to affect the heart and the affections, by any foreigner, of whatever de&s;criprion, as by PURCELL, ARNE, and BOYCE.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time it is nothing more than the truth, that native beauty of all de&s;criptions may acquire elegance by the adoption of foreign orna|ment. PURCELL him&s;elf &s;ays that mu&s;ic at that time
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was learning Italian, which is its be&s;t ma&s;ter, and &s;tudying a little of the French air to give it &s;omewhat more of gaiety and fa&s;hion;"</Q>
none of which is ami&s;s in able hands, but the danger has ever been that mi&s;taken elegance gets fanta&s;tic; till, in &s;cience, as in dre&s;s, ta&s;te is vitiated, proportion

deformed, and natural grace di&s;torted into extra|vagance, and caricature.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now take up the opera at the time that &s;huttlecock SWINEY was hu&s;tled out of his manage|ment and obliged to &s;eek &s;helter in a foreign cli|mate. There was no danger, the Italians having once ta&s;ted the &s;weets of Engli&s;h patronage, that &s;uch a market for the &s;ale of their wares &s;hould re|main un&s;tocked; and, fortunately for them, the very man formed by every left handed requi&s;ite to promote their cunning, their art, and their intrigues, became the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to poor SWINEY.</P>
<P>This man, who has been a good deal celebrated, and expo&s;ed with that hone&s;t truth and pointed in|dignation which very meritoriou&s;ly &s;trong the pen of FIELDING, who had been a kind of a &s;windling traveller to all the courts in Europe, where he had filched away the dro&s;s of every fanta&s;tic ta&s;te, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t particles of every &s;ervile &s;pecies of flattery, was called HEIDDEGER. He came to this country in the year 1708; and, though he enli&s;ted in the Guards for protection from his creditors, he had &s;o much impudence, and &s;o much in&s;inuation, that he got acce&s;s in the mo&s;t familiar way to many of the young &s;prigs of fa&s;hion, by whom he was called the Swi&s;s Count.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="442">Nothing could happen &s;o fortunate for him as SWINEY's declining intere&s;t in the opera. He in|&s;tantly laid his eye on being his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and be|gan his approaches by degrading every thing that the Engli&s;h had witne&s;&s;ed in the way of opera, and in &s;hort keeping to that rule which foreigners in|variably lay down of ri&s;ing upon the ruin of &s;ome|body. The Italians were of cour&s;e glad enough to rally round him, and he collected together VALEN|TINI, MARGUERITA, and &s;ome others to whom, by way of a ma&s;ter &s;troke, to &s;hew an apparent im|partiality, he added an Engli&s;h woman, the cele|brated Mrs. TOFTS, and thus armed and &s;upplied by the mu&s;ic of BONONCINI, SCARLATTI, STEF|FANI, GASPARINI, and ALBINONI, he took the operatical field with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s that he made pri|&s;oners of no le&s;s than five hundred Engli&s;h guineas in his very fir&s;t attack.</P>
<P>This was only a <HI>coup d'e&s;&s;ai.</HI> The opera was called <HI>Thomyris,</HI> and performed at the Queen's theatre at the Haymarket. It was tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, but the Italian &s;ingers managed the Engli&s;h words &s;o ill, that it became a cu&s;tom as before for Engli&s;h &s;ingers to &s;ing Engli&s;h, and Italian &s;ingers Italian, by which means nothing could be &s;o &s;trange
<PB N="444" REF="443">
a jumble as the opera. This is noticed perpetually in the Spectator, and indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible for any thing to be &s;o unnatural and di&s;gu&s;ting. At length, however, the operas were wholly Italian as they are now performed.</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary to mention that, during the &s;hort time AARON HILL had the management of the opera, which we have &s;een was in 1709, he invited HANDEL, who at that time began to be in great reputation on the Continent, to bring out an opera at the Haymarket, and this new acqui&s;ition was one of COLLIER's motives for breaking off with HILL. HEIDEGGER &s;tood by contemplating the&s;e circum&s;tances and watching a proper opportunity to &s;tep forward; and, thinking that a conjunction of foreign intere&s;ts would &s;erve his purpo&s;e he brought HANDEL forward as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible with every advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Rinaldo,</HI> in which there is certainly &s;ome beau|tiful mu&s;ic, was the opera HANDEL had compo&s;ed for HILL. It had great &s;ucce&s;s, and this gave HIEDEGGER an excellent opportunity of availing him&s;elf of, either his German auxiliary, or his Italian allies, as occa&s;ion might offer. He preferred Pa&s;|ticeios from the Italians becau&s;e they co&s;t nothing;
<PB N="445" REF="444">
but he rejoiced at this occa&s;ion of checking his mercenaries, as well as gratifying the ta&s;te of a people who &s;wallowed every thing foreign with &s;uch avidity.</P>
<P>Nothing, however, could exhibit &s;o heteroge|neous a medley as the opera. The operas com|po&s;ed by HANDEL, who was a German, were ge|nerally written in Engli&s;h and tran&s;lated into Italian. The Pa&s;ticcios were partly Engli&s;h and partly Ita|lian, &s;ung by Engli&s;h and Italian &s;ingers, and the whole was regulated by a Swi&s;s manager. The con&s;equence of all this was perpetual di&s;putes and appeals to the public; and, &s;o early as 1711, CLAY|TON, HAYM, and DIEUPART, found their &s;itua|tions intolerable, and &s;olicited &s;ub&s;criptions for private concerts.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt but that the &s;trictures in the Spectator were of infinite u&s;e in the regula|tion of the Opera. ADDISON laughs very &s;ucce&s;s|fully at the innovations on common &s;en&s;e that ren|dered this &s;pectacle more incongruous, for which there was no nece&s;&s;ity, than it was in its nature ob|liged to be. The &s;inging birds, in <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> is a happy opportunity for ridicule. The knocking down a part of the wall to make way for the en|trance
<PB N="446" REF="445">
of a hundred hor&s;emen, the introduction of the New River for a ca&s;cade, and the fireworks which this water is to extingui&s;h if any accident &s;hould happen, are admirable &s;trokes of irony, which, however, he concludes by advi&s;ing the pro|prietor to en&s;ure his hou&s;e previous to the per|formance. But &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is no wonder that &s;cenes &s;hould be very &s;urprizing which were con|trived by two poets of different nations, and rai&s;ed by two magicians of different &s;exes,"</Q>
to which he might have added that the characters were performed by beings of no &s;ex at all.</P>
<P>The happy hit concerning tran&s;lating and re|tran&s;lating, by which means the word pity, in the original, comes in place of rage in the copy, and therefore, de&s;troys the effect of the mu&s;ic, is al&s;o true &s;atire, and the re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h, who having heard opera, wholly Engli&s;h, &s;ung unin|telligibly by the Italians, afterwards half Engli&s;h, half Italian and at length, to &s;ettle the matter, who were content to hear it in a language they did not under&s;tand, is again a fair hit, and it cannot be de|nied that ADDISON de&s;erves the thanks of po&s;terity for the&s;e and other &s;en&s;ible remarks, calculated to explode the u&s;e of every thing incongruous and he|terogeneous, for the practice of the pre&s;ent day,

&s;hews us that he not only wrote a &s;evere and merited critique on the mon&s;ters of 1711, but anticipated at lea&s;t as &s;evere and as merited a critique on tho&s;e of 1799.</P>
<P>Decency, propriety, and a re&s;pect, and reve|rence, for manners, and decorum, however, made the boundary upon this &s;ubject to ADDISON's judg|ment. His opinions concerning mu&s;ic, one of which is that it will admit of nothing but non&s;en&s;e, probably becau&s;e <HI>Ro&s;omond</HI> did not &s;ucceed, are without ex|ception erroneous, and HAWKINS is perfectly right in bringing forward, as a proof of this, his prefer|ence of French mu&s;ic to Italian. We have &s;een how differently PURCELL made the di&s;tinction. The Pope is &s;aid to have laughed mo&s;t heartily at this ri|dicule of the Italian opera in ENGLAND, which was &s;en&s;ible enough. No doubt the latter part of the critique turned the laugh from the derided, to the derider.</P>
<P>Operas continued to be carried on by HEIDEG|GER with various &s;ucce&s;s, till the reign of GEORGE the &s;econd, when that high prie&s;t in the temple of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s introduced a &s;pecies of amu&s;e|ment which the court of CHARLES the &s;econd, with all its pro&s;ligacy, was a &s;tranger to.

<P>Another thing is told of him &s;till more whim&s;ical.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The face|tious duke of MONTAGUE, projector of the Bottle Conjuring bu|&s;ine&s;s, procured a ma&s;k to be taken of HEIDEGGER, and a &s;imilar dre&s;s to that which he was to wear at a ma&s;querade, and when this ma&s;ter of the ceremonies had retired, after ordering the band to play God &s;ave the King, upon his maje&s;ty's arrival at the rooms, he cau&s;ed his repre&s;entative to order them to play Over the Water to Charley. The company were thunder&s;truck, and HEIDEGGER ran to &s;et the matter to rights, &s;wearing that the band were drunk or mad, and ordered them mo&s;t petemptorily to recommence God &s;ave the King. The moment his back was turned the fal&s;e HEIDDEGGER commanded Over the Water to Charley again. This went on to the delight of the king and his courtiers; till after the band had been kicked out of the orche&s;tra, and their commanding officer di&s;tracted at this &s;trange appearance of du|plicity of which he was not guilty, the counterfeit &s;tepped for|ward and a&s;&s;ured the king that he was the true HIEDDEGGER, and that the other was only the Devil in his likene&s;s.

<P><PB N="449" REF="448">The hi&s;tory of the opera began now to con&s;i&s;t of &s;o many, and &s;uch inextricable particulars, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate them here. HEIDDEGGER,
<PB N="450" REF="449">
during the time he pre&s;ided as manager, which was till the year 1730, acted like another CIBBER, but was under a nece&s;&s;ity of putting on a great deal more of the Machiaval. CIBBER had only Engli&s;h actors and actre&s;&s;es to manage, HEIDDEGGER had compo&s;ers living and dead, and of all countries to re|concile as well as the intere&s;ts of Engli&s;h and Italian &s;ingers, in&s;trumental performers and dancers, with all the operatical &s;chi&s;ms branching from the caprice and folly of their different &s;upporters.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ion of an opera &s;inger was now be|come a matter of the greate&s;t importance, and the care&s;&s;es and lavi&s;h bounty of princes had made per|&s;ons of this de&s;cription in&s;ufferably in&s;olent. One lady, Mrs. ROBINSON, had married lord PE|TERBOROUGH, and others had patrons and pro|tectors out of number; but this was not all. There was &s;carcely a per&s;on of quality, of either &s;ex, that did not appear to be fa&s;cinated with opera &s;inging, and to take in&s;tructions from the different per|formers, every one of whom had thus a &s;eperate pa|rtizan, By this means no &s;ingle pa&s;&s;ion or affection could be fa&s;hionably uttered, or &s;ubject di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, without &s;ome quoted exclamation in bad Italian. The various di&s;putes about CUZZONI and FAUSTINA may &s;erve as one example of that &s;candalous height
<PB N="451" REF="450">
to which the in&s;olence of opera &s;ingers was arrived, but which, neverthele&s;s, did not reach its climax till FARINELLI.</P>
<P>CUZZONI had continued in exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the opera and the public, as fir&s;t &s;inger, without a rival till FAUSTINA made her appearance. She governed &s;o completely without control, and com|manded managers, compo&s;ers, and &s;ingers, with &s;o high a hand that HANDEL, who of cour&s;e had diffi|culty enough to brook &s;uch imperious conduct, threatened one day to throw her out of the window. She carried the matter too far in provoking the Ger|man, for he in&s;tantly put engines to work to &s;et her up a rival, and FAUSTINA at length appeared to be a mo&s;t formidable one.</P>
<P>No public character &s;hould ever count too long upon popularity, e&s;pecially when the expectation is built upon no better ba&s;is than caprice, and fa&s;hion|able ta&s;te, which vary as often and as unaccountably in matters of amu&s;ement, as in dre&s;s. No &s;ooner did FAUSTINA appear, who for one thing was hand|&s;omer than her rival, than &s;he had her &s;upporters, for the&s;e people are always cunning enough to bar|gain for patronage before they budge a &s;tep from home.</P>
<P><PB N="452" REF="451">HANDEL in this mea&s;ure very &s;en&s;ibly hoped to beget in the&s;e &s;ingers a &s;pirit of emulation, and render their different abilities the means of &s;erving very laudably the purpo&s;e of the general operatical intere&s;t. CUZZONI had a fine voice, and was com|plete mi&s;tre&s;s of the pathos; &s;he &s;ung naturally, ap|pealed to the feelings, and touched the heart. FAU|STINA had great powers of execution, &s;he &s;ung quick pa&s;&s;ages with wonderful facilty, and ran divi&s;ions to a&s;toni&s;hment. In &s;hort one plea&s;ed, the other &s;ur|pri&s;ed; one created delight, the other wonder.</P>
<P>HANDEL in&s;tantly &s;et about compo&s;ing &s;ongs &s;uitable to their difficult &s;tyles of &s;inging; and, thus while CUZZONI melted the audience into tears in <HI>Afanni del Pen&s;ier,</HI> in Otho, FAUSTINA &s;ur|prized them into wonder in <HI>Alla &s;ua Gabbia D'oro,</HI> in Alexander, in which &s;ong &s;he is &s;aid to have imitated very naturally the warbling of the nightingale. This competition, however, did all HANDEL had hoped, but unfortunately at length it did a great deal more than he hoped, for it became as much a party bu&s;ine&s;s as a conte&s;ted election, nay more; for the politics, in the regions of ta&s;te, are always &s;upported with greater vehemence than the politics of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Epigrams, lampoons, and a hundred other &s;quibs, written by hungry poets, who by this means got a
<PB N="453" REF="452">
dinner which was the only good the di&s;pute occa|&s;ioned, &s;warmed about the town. Lady PEMBROKE at head of her party, in favour of CUZZONI, took the field in per&s;on again&s;t lady BURLINGTON, who commanded a ho&s;t in behalf of FAUSTINA; till af|ter riots, libels, duels, and a long <HI>et caetera</HI> of natural con&s;equences, poor CUZZONI was obliged to yield the palm to her more formidable rival; who, being younger and hand&s;omer, had all the men on her &s;ide.</P>
<P>The managers, con&s;idering the matter ad|ju&s;ted by the fiat of the public, thought to give an extraordinary proof of their impartiality by &s;eeming at the &s;ame time to acknowledge the &s;upe|riority of FAUSTINA, and yet do ju&s;tice to the great merits of CUZZONI. The time, therefore, being come for the renewal of articles, they made a pro|mi&s;e to FAUSTINA that whatever might be the new bargain, &s;he &s;hould receive a guinea a year more than her rival.</P>
<P>This was con&s;idered as &s;uch a flagrant act of in|ju&s;tice by the &s;upporters of CUZZONI, and in par|ticular by lady PEMBROKE, that they made her &s;wear upon the Evangeli&s;ts never to receive le&s;s than FAU|STINA, and the managers, who began to be tired of the di&s;pute, and in particular HANDEL, to whom &s;he mu&s;t have been a torment, determined to &s;hew that
<PB N="454" REF="453">
they regarded their word as &s;acredly as &s;he her oath, fairly let her go to the Continent remunerated by her noble protectors. But to &s;hew how worthily bounty of this kind is generally be&s;towed, &s;he was gulled abroad by a crafty Italian, and came back to ENGLAND in 1748, when being old, and having lo&s;t her voice her former benefactors did not chu&s;e to know her, but on the contrary intimated that it was wicked in her to break her oath, which, however, &s;he did and performed in MITHRIDATE; till, finding it would not do, &s;he once more returned to ITALY, where &s;he died in indigence.</P>
<P>FAUSTINA was more fortunate. She took care of a good fortune which &s;he had acquired in EN|GLAND, and afterwards was married to HASSE the fa|mous compo&s;er, at DRESDEN, and was twenty years ago living very much re&s;pected at VIENNA. It is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s over this article without giving &s;ome circum&s;tances relative to FARINELLI, with which, and a brief account of opera compo&s;ers, and &s;ingers, I &s;hall clo&s;e the fourth volume of this work.</P>
<P>The arrival of FARINELLI, who came over to ENGLAND with PORPORA the compo&s;er, and AMI|CONI, the painter, was announced with as much pa|rade as if he had come emba&s;&s;ador to &s;ettle the mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of the nation. He was gazed at as a
<PB N="455" REF="454">
prodigy, introduced to the king, accompanied on the harp&s;ichord in his <HI>coup d'e&s;&s;ai</HI> by the Prince&s;s of Orange, invited to companies of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, and happy were they who could blunder out a com|compliment in Italian to this wonderful being, or receive from him the great conde&s;cen&s;ion of a &s;u|percilious an&s;wer.</P>
<P>SENESINO was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage, like CUZZINO, before FAUSTINA, when this phaenome|non came to eclip&s;e him. SENESINO's merit was al&s;o &s;implicity and pathos, and FARINELLI's exe|cution, which he is &s;aid to have carried to a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing exce&s;s. We are told that he had an oc|tave more in his voice than any other &s;inger ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and that the mo&s;t exten&s;ive woman's voice ever known had no &s;uch compa&s;s in alt. Poor SE|NESINO, with all his &s;weetne&s;s of tone, which he is allowed to have had in a &s;uperior degree to FARI|NELLI, was of cour&s;e thrown into the back ground.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ents he received were innumerable; he was idolized by the women of fa&s;hion to adoration. One lady exclaimed from the boxes,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"One GOD, one FARINELLI!"</Q>
This in&s;atuation was &s;o ex|ce&s;&s;ive, &s;o effiminate, and &s;o di&s;graceful, that not only &s;everal manly writers of our own country, but foreigners, reprobated in terms of a&s;toni&s;hment and
<PB N="456" REF="455">
di&s;dain &s;uch a departure from the hardy, hone&s;t, and honourable character for which Britons had ever been &s;o gloriou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed, and the obloquy and contempt into which they would inevitably plunge them&s;elves by emulating the ta&s;te and folly of a nation long &s;ince &s;unk into voluptuou&s;ne&s;s and imbecility.</P>
<P>The misfortune was that during all this time no|body knew why this lavi&s;h applau&s;e, and more la|vi&s;h bounty, for FARINELLI received more than five thou&s;and a year, was be&s;towed. Not one in fifty was capable of giving a rea&s;on why he &s;ung better than SENESINO; and, as to his deportment, it was di&s;gu&s;ting beyond mea&s;ure, his figure being as tall as a giant, and as thin as a &s;hadow, therefore, if he had grace it could be only of a &s;ort to be envied by a penguin, or a &s;pider.</P>
<P>But let us turn from this monument of Engli&s;h folly to examine the re&s;t of the operatical corps; who, though in &s;ome mea&s;ure their encouragement was reproachable enough, did not &s;o abjectly di&s;|grace us, in particular the compo&s;ers, for their la|bours were meritorious, and worthy of the counte|nance they received.</P>
<P>The contention at this time lay between the Ita|lians,
<PB N="457" REF="456">
the Germans, and the Engli&s;h. The Italian mu&s;ic upon the whole had the preference for a time, and probably would have e&s;tabli&s;hed a correcter ta&s;te, had not HANDEL, with all his merit, kept up that coldne&s;s and phlegm that was but too apparent in the &s;tyle of our profe&s;&s;ors. It gave a &s;pirit of emu|lation to &s;ucceed in ab&s;tru&s;e harmony and &s;tudied modulation, and if PURCELL had been obliged to re&s;train his genius, before HANDEL, how much more mu&s;t it have been nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch compo&s;ers as GREEN, TRAVERS, GATES, and others, many of whom, unable to conte&s;t the point with foreigners, pur&s;ued a more profitable though a le&s;s reputable cour&s;e; and, as they could not get their own mu&s;ic a reception, taught that of others which was more to the public ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The Italians, however, did not &s;o tacitly aqui|e&s;ce in yielding the &s;uperiority to HANDEL, and BONONCINI in particular &s;et him&s;elf forward in as pointed a conte&s;t with that compo&s;er, as that of CUZZONI and FAUSTINA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SWIFT's whim&s;ical note of Tweedledum and Tweedledee was written upon this occa&s;ion, at which a living author, as amiable in his manners as he is elegant in his writings, has, I think a little too fa&s;ti|diou&s;ly taking umbrage. I don't know how far SWIFT had a &s;oul for mu&s;ic, but it is plain he does not in this ca&s;e ridicule the merit of the men but the folly of the public.</NOTE>. HANDEL, however, carried his point triumphantly; and thus, with all the
<PB N="458" REF="457">
&s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial merit of the various pieces brought out by this celebrated compo&s;er, the opera was certainly not of that &s;pecies be&s;t calculated to command the admiration of this country, till the more &s;plendid and general beauties in the melodies of JOMELLI, PERGOLESI, and GALLUPPI, cleared away that buzz of harmonic combination that had &s;o long perplexed, but not &s;atisfied, the Engli&s;h ear.</P>
<P>As to the performers. I have &s;hewn they were partly Engli&s;h and partly Italians. This mixture, indeed, had been always cu&s;tomary. Mrs. ARA|BELLA HUNT had been in PURCELL's time as cele|brated as was afterwards Mrs. TOFTS, and after her Mrs. ROBINSON, MARGUERITA, ISABELLA, GIRARDEAU, the BARONESS, GALLIA, and then FAUSTINA, CUZZONI, and others were the female &s;ingers; as to the men, VALENTINI kept the &s;tage till he was driven out by SENESINO, who afterwards gave way to FARINELLI, even as one wedge driveth out another, as ADDISON makes Vellum &s;ay in the <HI>Drummer,</HI> The opera, however, was now, like every thing el&s;e dramatic, drawing to the zenith of its reputation, having acquired a &s;plendour and a con&s;equence &s;oon after the fir&s;t appearance of GARRICK.</P>
