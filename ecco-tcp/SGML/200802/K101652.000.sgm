<LG>
<L>"HOW idle are mortals!" (&s;aid Wi&s;dom to Youth)</L>
<L>"They &s;light the clear dictates of Rea&s;on and Truth;</L>
<L>"They wor&s;hip Ambition, to Plea&s;ure they bend,</L>
<L>"Yet blindly o'erlook a more excellent friend:</L>
<L>"And hence their vain hopes are eternally cro&s;t,</L>
<L>"Their life in a tempe&s;t of wi&s;hes is lo&s;t;</L>
<L>"Still de&s;tin'd to toil, and of toil to repent,</L>
<L>"For neglect of ju&s;t vows to the Godde&s;s Content;</L>
<L>"That Godde&s;s from whom all felicity flows,</L>
<L>"Who unites every good in the gift &s;he be&s;tows;</L>
<L>"So free of her bounty to all who confe&s;s it,</L>

<L>When I heard this fine &s;peech, my fond pa&s;&s;ion was rais'd,</L>
<L>And I &s;et forth in que&s;t of the Being &s;o prais'd;</L>
<L>At the man&s;ion of Grandeur my &s;earch I begin,</L>
<L>And a&s;k if the Godde&s;s Content is within:</L>
<L>But Pride, who as centinel guarded the door,</L>
<L>Said bluntly he ne'er heard her title before;</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="54">
He told me I wanted a poor ru&s;tic &s;lut,</L>
<L>And bade me go look in &s;ome little thatch'd hut.</L>
<L>I march'd to the Villager's lowly abode,</L>
<L>'Twas a &s;nug pretty cottage, and &s;tood near the road:</L>
<L>And here a good woman, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, tho' humble,</L>
<L>A face that could frown, and a tongue that would grumble,</L>
<L>Said&mdash;the per&s;on I a&s;k'd for had lodg'd in her cot,</L>
<L>But, alas! &s;uch good luck was no longer her lot;</L>
<L>For &s;he quitted her roof, where &s;he oft had repos'd,</L>
<L>When you great hou&s;e was built, and the common inclos'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I conceiv'd, as I now bade the village farewell,</L>
<L>With the mild &s;ons of Science this Godde&s;s mu&s;t dwell;</L>
<L>But tho&s;e, where I &s;ought &s;ome obliging in&s;tructor,</L>
<L>Were &s;quabbling about an electric conductor.</L>
<L>Some cry'd up the point; &s;ome commended the ball;</L>
<L>The &s;oft breath of Science was turn'd to a &s;quall:</L>
<L>The Sages no mental conductor could find</L>
<L>To draw off the flame that now fla&s;h'd on their mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In ha&s;te I exclaim'd, to the Learned adieu!</L>
<L>For even Science offends, when &s;he talks like a &s;hrew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="55" REF="55">
<L>Having wander'd &s;o wide of the object I &s;ought,</L>
<L>I was now led to think, and rejoic'd at the thought,</L>
<L>This Godde&s;s (her&s;elf for her charms &s;o renown'd)</L>
<L>With the daughters of Beauty mu&s;t &s;urely be found</L>
<L>With this hope I approach'd (unperceiv'd by them all)</L>
<L>Three lovely young girls ju&s;t array'd for the ball;</L>
<L>In each, who&s;e bright eyes on a mirror were bent,</L>
<L>I thought I di&s;cover'd a &s;park of Content;</L>
<L>But watching them more, in their beautiful faces,</L>
<L>Of the godde&s;s I &s;ought I no more &s;aw the traces;</L>
<L>For as they &s;urvey'd, with a critical glance,</L>
<L>The elegant MONTAGU move in the dance,</L>
<L>In her exqui&s;ite figure &s;uch graces were &s;hewn,</L>
<L>That viewing her charms they di&s;tru&s;ted their own.</L>
<L>Thou gentle&s;t of nymphs! while thy triumphs increa&s;e,</L>
<L>Uncon&s;cious of beauty, &s;o fatal to peace!</L>
<L>Tho' the &s;parks of Content in one &s;ex thou may'&s;t &s;mother,</L>
<L>Bright Ec&s;ta&s;y's flame thou wilt rai&s;e in the other.</L>
<L>If in bo&s;om parental Content could re&s;ide,</L>
<L>The heart of thy parent this trea&s;ure mu&s;t hide;</L>
<L>But, alas! 'tis a truth which all parents lament,</L>
<L>Their tender anxiety &s;tifles Content.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O tell me, while vainly to find thee I pant,</L>
<L>Dear latent Divinity! where is thy haunt?</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="56">
"Away to Bathea&s;ton," Good-nature replies,</L>
<L>"Behold &s;he there weaves the poetical prize."</L>
<L>With thy Myrtle, kind MILLER! O let me be crown'd,</L>
<L>Then my &s;earch is repaid, and the Godde&s;s is found:</L>
<L>Nay, if to another your wreath you a&s;&s;ign,</L>
<L>And give it to ver&s;e far &s;uperior to mine,</L>
<L>My &s;earch's dear object I &s;till mu&s;t attain,</L>
<L>And the proof of this wonder's exceedingly plain,</L>
<L>It re&s;ts on this maxim, by Horace invented,</L>
<L>The Bard who writes wor&s;t is the Bard mo&s;t con|tented.</L>
<L>My claim to this ble&s;&s;ing thus made very clear,</L>
<L>If I've nothing to hope, I have nothing to fear;</L>
<L>For MILLER can plea&s;e while the mind &s;he amu&s;es,</L>
<L>Both when &s;he be&s;tows, and e'en when &s;he refu&s;es;</L>
<L>In truth I &s;u&s;pect, from her &s;ingular aim,</L>
<L>The Godde&s;s I &s;eek is conceal'd by her name;</L>
<L>She her&s;elf is Content, and her hou&s;e is the fane,</L>
<L>Where Spleen and Ill-nature no favours obtain:</L>
<L>Some mortals in vain for admi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t pray,</L>
<L>But all who once enter go &s;miling away.</L>
