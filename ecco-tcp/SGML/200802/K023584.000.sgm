<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO DAVID GARRICK, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is matter of great doubt whether any dedicatory addre&s;s was ever freer from taint of flattery, than the pre&s;ent; if we pronounce you the be&s;t illu&s;trator of, and the be&s;t <HI>living comment</HI> on, SHAKESPEARE, that ever has ap|peared, or po&s;&s;ibly ever will grace the Briti&s;h &s;tage, it is merely echoing the public voice, and concurring with that unparalleled unanimity of prai&s;e, which, during &s;o long a cour&s;e of years, hath attended your incomparable merit.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">This compact edition of SHAKE|SPEARE is offered you as a grateful, tho' &s;mall, return, for the infinite plea&s;ure, and exten&s;ive information, derived from your exqui&s;ite perfor|mance, and judicious remarks, by,</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>SHAKESPEARE's admirers, even the enthu&s;ia&s;tic ones, who wor&s;hip him as <HI>the god of their idolatry,</HI> have never &s;cru|pled to admit that his mo&s;t regular pieces produce &s;ome &s;cenes and pa&s;&s;ages, highly derogatory to his incomparable general me|rit; he frequently trifles, is now and then ob&s;cure, and, &s;ometimes, to gratify a vitiated age, indelicate: but can any degree of cri|tical ta&s;te wi&s;h the pre&s;ervation of dark &s;pots, becau&s;e they have grown upon dramatic &s;un|&s;hine? is not the corrective hand frequently proved to be the kinde&s;t? critics, like pa|rents, &s;hould neither &s;pare the rod, nor u&s;e it wantonly.</P>
<P>There is no doubt but all our author's faults may ju&s;tly be attributed to the loo&s;e, quibbling, licentious ta&s;te of his time; he, no doubt, upon many occa&s;ions, wrote wildly, merely to gratify the public; as DRYDEN wrote bomba&s;tically, and CON|GREVE ob&s;cenely, to indulge the humour, and engage the favour of their audiences: no man can &s;uppo&s;e that the former con&s;i|dered his rhiming dialogues as marks of &s;ublimity, nor that the latter imagined his
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<HI>double entendres</HI> were wit; one wanted money, the other fame; for which, pompous &s;ounds and gro&s;s ideas, were then popular baits; con&s;equently, cha&s;te critici&s;m and delicacy were without &s;cruple, &s;acrificed to their &s;everal views.</P>
<P>Our author did not go quite &s;o far, but very frequently pre&s;erved him&s;elf free from taint, reining his fiery PEGASUS with an able ma&s;terly hand; why then &s;hould not the noble monuments he has left us, of unri|valled ability, be re&s;tored to due proportion and natural lu&s;tre, by &s;weeping off tho&s;e cobwebs, and that du&s;t of depraved opinion, which SHAKESPEARE was unfortunately forced to throw on them; forced, we &s;ay, for it is no &s;train of imagination, to &s;uppo&s;e that the Goths and Vandals of critici&s;m, who frequented the theatre, in his days, would, like tho&s;e who over-ran the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, have de&s;troyed and con&s;igned to bar|barous oblivion, the &s;ublime beauties which they could not reli&s;h; and it is matter of great que&s;tion with us, whether the fool, in <HI>King Lear,</HI> was not a more general fa|vourite, than the old monarch him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The above con&s;iderations fir&s;t &s;tarted the idea, and induced the undertaking, of this edition; and as the THEATRES, e&s;pecially
<PB N="7" REF="6">
of late, have been generally right in their omi&s;&s;ions, of this author particularly, we have printed our <HI>text</HI> after their regulations; and from this part of our de&s;ign, an evident u&s;e will ari&s;e; that tho&s;e who take books to the THEATRE, will not be &s;o puzzled them|&s;elves to accompany the &s;peaker; nor &s;o apt to condemn performers of being imperfect, when they pa&s;s over what is de&s;ignedly omit|ted. Upon this point, however, it is to be ob&s;erved, that the difference of power, of voice and execution, between different per|formers, may make one era&s;e more than ano|ther; neverthele&s;s we come &s;o near the mark of all, that &s;carce any perplexity can ari&s;e, in tracing them; be&s;ides we would hope, that a rea&s;onable &s;tandard being thus laid down, profe&s;&s;ors of the drama will not be &s;o forward, as capriciou&s;ly and arbitrarily to deviate from it; it is commendable to con&s;ult the extent of expre&s;&s;ion, but thro' idlene&s;s to retrench what is beautiful and nece&s;&s;ary, or through vanity to retain what is heavy and une&s;&s;ential to action, we deem an affront to the public, and a di&s;grace to the performer.</P>
<P>As an author, replete with &s;pirited ideas, and a full flow of language, e&s;pecially one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing <HI>a mu&s;e of fire,</HI> cannot &s;top exactly where &s;tage utterance and public attention
<PB N="8" REF="7">
require; &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, of great merit for the clo&s;et, are never &s;poken; &s;uch, though omitted in the text, we have carefully pre|&s;erved in the notes.</P>
<P>And now, being upon this part of our &s;ubject, we hold our&s;elves bound in ju&s;tice and gratitude to Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> to mention a delicate fear, which he &s;ugge&s;ted, when we fir&s;t &s;olicited his &s;anction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This fear was, le&s;t the prunings, tran&s;po&s;itions, or other alterations, which, in his province as a manager he had often found nece&s;&s;ary to make, or adopt, with regard to the text, for the con|venience of repre&s;entation, or accommoda|tion to the powers and capacities of his per|formers, might be mi&s;con&s;trued into a cri|tical pre&s;umption of offering to the literati a reformed and more correct edition of our author's works; this being by no means his intention, we hope it will not become liable to &s;uch an unmerited mi&s;con&s;truction. In ju&s;tification of our&s;elves al&s;o, we take this opportunity of declaring, that to expect any thing more of this work, than as <HI>a com|panion to the theatre,</HI> is to mi&s;take the pur|po&s;e of the editors.</P>
<P>Having been long convinced that multi|plying conjectural verbal critici&s;ms, tends rather to perplex, than inform readers; we
<PB N="9" REF="8">
have given tho&s;e readings which to us ap|pear mo&s;t con&s;onant to our author's manner and meaning, without obtruding one capri|cious opinion on another.</P>
<P>We have furni&s;hed an explanation of technical and ob&s;olete terms; pointed out the leading beauties, as they occur, without de&s;canting &s;o much as to anticipate the rea|der's conception and inve&s;tigation; we have &s;hewn, with a becoming impartiality, what ap|pear to us to be blemi&s;hes and imperfections: the requi&s;ites for repre&s;enting every character of importance are defined, and the mode of performance e&s;&s;ential for &s;cenes pecu|liarly capital, is clearly pointed out.</P>
<P>We have earne&s;tly con&s;ulted correctne&s;s, neatne&s;s, ornament, utility, and cheapne&s;s of price; we have avoided all o&s;tentation of critici&s;m, compacting our notes as much as po&s;&s;ible; in regard whereof, it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that we could have enlarged the number, and extended the phra&s;eology, with much le&s;s trouble, than it co&s;t us to give them their pre&s;ent form; it has been our peculiar endeavour to render what we call the e&s;&s;ence of SHAKESPEARE, more in|&s;tructive and intelligible; e&s;pecially to the ladies and to youth; glaring indecencies be|ing removed, and intricate pa&s;&s;ages explain|ed;
<PB N="10" REF="9">
and la&s;tly, we have &s;triven to &s;upply plainer ideas of critici&s;m, both in public and private, than we have hitherto met with.</P>
<P>A general view of each play is given, by way of introduction.</P>
<P>Though this is not an edition meant for the profoundly learned, nor the deeply &s;tudious, who love to find out, and chace their own critical game; yet we flatter our|&s;elves both parties may perceive fre&s;h ideas &s;tarted for &s;peculation and reflection.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY ON ORATORY.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH it is not &s;trictly within the limits of our plan, to range at large over the ex|ten&s;ive field of oratorical correctne&s;s, fancy and excellence, as it re&s;pects the pulpit, &s;enate, and bar; yet it is hoped we &s;hall &s;o far touch on the e&s;&s;entials of them all, as to give hints, which may prove u&s;eful to each of the three degrees.</P>
<P>If we &s;ay that an orator, like a poet, to excel, &s;hould be born &s;uch, it will be no &s;trained a&s;&s;er|tion; and if we add that he mu&s;t be more indebted to nature, than a &s;on of the mu&s;es, it will be ea&s;ily admitted. Cultivated imagination, regulated by judgment, con&s;titutes one; who, totally void of external requi&s;ites, may &s;hine from his clo&s;et, tho' ever &s;o deformed in figure, rude in features, weak in voice, or blemi&s;h'd in appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">The other, though he may, by peculiar excel|lence of delivery, and the help of a feeling &s;ub|ject well treated on, be able to impre&s;s an audience, with little more than a good voice; yet experience powerfully convinces us that a graceful per&s;on, re|&s;pectable marking features, expre&s;&s;ive eyes, and ornamental ge&s;ture, are of the utmo&s;t utility: it is no argument to &s;ay, that a man, as in the ca&s;e of Sir <HI>John Fielding,</HI> tho' the vi&s;ual gates of &s;ympa|thy be &s;hut, may &s;how &s;trong marks of oratorical merit; for the que&s;tion naturally follows, would he not be much more powerful in expre&s;&s;ion, if the indexes of thought enjoyed their natural and proper vigour, e&s;pecially where particular feelings are to be excited?</P>
<P>It is too common for ignorance and avarice, to mi&s;apply the talents of youth, e&s;pecially in this point of view; many are de&s;tined for, and brought up to the mo&s;t &s;erious, the mo&s;t important con|cerns of life, wherein public &s;peaking is required, who labour under glaring defects and imbecilities of expre&s;&s;ion; hence &s;o many drow&s;y, irk&s;ome preachers, &s;o many &s;enatorical cyphers; and &s;uch a number of imperfect pleaders: this parental blunder is much the &s;ame as breeding a purblind boy to watchmaking, or one hard of hearing to mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing a per&s;on qualified by nature, let us &s;ee how far art may be called in. The complete orator mu&s;t have a general and intimate knowledge of him&s;elf, the world and mankind; a clear con|ception of the pa&s;&s;ions and affections of tho&s;e he is to in&s;truct and per&s;uade; a perfect acquaintance with the various di&s;tinctions of virtue and vice; he &s;hould be critically intimate with all the beau|ties and blemi&s;hes of the ancient writers; he &s;hould
<PB N="13" REF="12">
be an hi&s;torian and a logician; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a correct idea of, and ta&s;te for, the liberal arts; if a com|petent knowledge of the mechanical ones is added, &s;o much the better; he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a quick con|ception, and a retentive memory; he &s;hould be able to break thro', with ea&s;e, the cobwebs of &s;o|phi&s;try, and, above all, enjoy that grand ingre|dient recommended by CICERO, &s;ocial philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>He &s;hould be ma&s;ter of all the arguments, for and again&s;t his &s;ubject; in &s;hort, to &s;um up all with the great <HI>Roman</HI> orator's own words,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he &s;hould be furni&s;hed with logical acutene&s;s, phi|lo&s;ophical wi&s;dom, and poetical imagination, embelli&s;hed with the mo&s;t poli&s;hed elocution and ge&s;ture of the &s;tage."</Q></P>
<P>To expatiate upon the obvious advantages de|riveable from each of the above qualifications re|quired to complete this very comprehen&s;ive cha|racter we are con&s;idering, would be to &s;pin out a needle&s;s length of explanation; which could an|&s;wer no end, but anticipating the reader's reflec|tive inve&s;tigation; wherefore we &s;hall quit this point, with ob&s;erving, that when &s;o many requi|&s;ites, both internal and external are nece&s;&s;ary, it is no wonder that a complete orator is &s;o very &s;carce a character.</P>
<P>Declaimers, who may be ju&s;tly &s;tiled the pageants of oratory, po&s;&s;e&s;s the flowery, but not the argu|mentative, part; they appeal boldly to fancy and the pa&s;&s;ions, but cautiou&s;ly &s;hun rational inqui&s;i|tion; &s;hew and plau&s;ibility completely <HI>&s;et</HI> up one of this dangerous kind of public &s;peakers, who oftener make pro&s;elytes among the weak and igno|rant, than &s;ound orators do; as they are mo&s;tly plea&s;ing, tho' &s;eldom in&s;tructive. Bi&s;hop <HI>Sprat,</HI> &s;peaking of them, in his hi&s;tory of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
emphatically &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of all the &s;tudies of men, no|thing can be &s;ooner obtained, than a vicious abundance of phra&s;e; the trick of metaphors, and a volubility of tongue."</Q></P>
<P>Having come thus far, the three celebrated ora|tors of antiquity &s;eem to fall in the way; DEMOS|THENES, ISOCRATES and CICERO; the fir&s;t &s;poke from the heart, the &s;econd from the head; the fir&s;t was animated by his &s;ubject and powerfully enforced it; the &s;econd decked it profu&s;ely with rhetorical flowers; one fla&s;hed conviction, by ir|re&s;i&s;table imagery; the other amu&s;ed imagination, with fanta&s;tical allu&s;ions: of ISOCRATES we may &s;ay, his eloquence re&s;embled a plea&s;ant, but &s;hal|low, &s;tream, which tickles the ear with an agree|able murmuring: DEMOSTHENES a deep maje&s;tic current, that in its cour&s;e thunders on attention, and bears down all oppo&s;ition: ISOCRATES po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es ea&s;e and elegance, DEMOSTHENES power and per&s;wa&s;ion; CICERO who ri&s;es far above the former, does not in our idea come up to the latter; he is however a very ma&s;terly mixture of both, and therefore more likely to obtain general admi|ration, than either of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Oratory is well defined <HI>the exerci&s;e of eloquence</HI>; eloquence the <HI>fluency of &s;peech</HI>; and rhetoric the <HI>guide of both.</HI> It is odd that the&s;e three terms &s;hould frequently be u&s;ed as &s;ynonimous, when they &s;o e&s;&s;entially differ.</P>
<P>Oratorical compo&s;ition &s;hould be founded on a progre&s;&s;ive unity of parts, but not like &s;ome of our &s;ermons, which are di&s;graced with in&s;ipid metho|dical formality commonly &s;tiled <HI>heads</HI>; it &s;hould enter mode&s;tly upon, warm into the &s;ubject, and, if required, kindle to fire, when the audience are ready to receive heated impre&s;&s;ions; an impa&s;|&s;ioned
<PB N="15" REF="14">
exordium generally produces a cold conclu|&s;ion; and that piece, which endeavours to catch attention too &s;uddenly, will either not catch it at all, or be obliged &s;oon to let it &s;lip.</P>
<P>FENELON, ARCHBISHOP OF CAMBRAY, de|&s;cribing the Beauties of Eloquence, &s;peaks to the following effect:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Of what u&s;e can any ornament be, that does not tend to prove, to paint, or to affect? tho&s;e ornaments, which only plea&s;e, are fal&s;e beauties; tho&s;e which plea&s;e and per&s;uade, &s;olid ones; the ju&s;t and natural emotions of an orator have much grace and beauty in them; his correct and &s;pirited painting charms us; all the e&s;&s;ential parts of eloquencce tend to plea&s;e; but merely plea&s;ing is not the mo&s;t important aim; ideas and expre&s;&s;ions, which only tickle the ear, may be deemed quaint turns; all graces of &s;tyle, which &s;erve to invigorate per&s;ua&s;ion, are to be wi&s;h'd for; but all witty, punning conceits, all quibbling upon words, all &s;trained metaphors, all forced glaring imagery, and all luxurance of idea, which only &s;erve to fla&s;h and glitter upon fancy, di&s;grace &s;ound oratory."</Q></P>
<P>In public &s;peaking, as well as in poetry and painting, art &s;hould be carefully concealed: where perceptible, it has a coar&s;e and mean a&s;pect. The orator &s;hould &s;o intirely po&s;&s;e&s;s his audience of the &s;ubject, as to make them forget the &s;peaker.</P>
<P>From the affecting exclamation of <HI>Gracchus,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Cicero,</HI> and a dilation of it, we per|ceive how expre&s;&s;ion &s;trengthens, or enervates, a &s;ubject:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Wretched man that I am! whither &s;hall I turn my&s;elf? where can I go? to the Capitol? it &s;wims with my brother's blood! &s;hall I go to to my own hou&s;e? there to &s;ee my wretched mo|ther di&s;&s;olved in tears, and overwhelmed with
<PB N="16" REF="15">
&s;orrow?"</Q>
This is a beautiful, bold, and affect|ing picture of perplexed grief: mark how faded the tints of originality appear in the following faint copy:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know not where to go, nor whi|ther I &s;hall turn my&s;elf, amid&s;t my misfor|tunes&mdash;the Capitol is the place where my bro|ther's blood was &s;hed; and at home I &s;hall find my unhappy mother lamenting her &s;ad con|dition."</Q>
With very narrow comprehen&s;ion and very dull feelings we may readily perceive the fall|ing off, in this languid exten&s;ion and variation of phra&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;hall offer an in&s;tance of the turgid and cha&s;te, in the following comparative contra&s;t. Suppo&s;e a per&s;on addre&s;&s;ing an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> audience, on a pre|&s;umed decay of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> liberty, &s;hould thus de|claim;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mo&s;t renowned <HI>Britons</HI>&mdash;in the magna|nimous volume of Time we may read&mdash;even purblind eyes may &s;ee the glaring type, that there was a period, when liberty, diaphanous as &s;un-beams at noon, exhilarated this oceanic i&s;le; when like the bird of <HI>Jove</HI> it &s;oar'd aloft, and gazed with plea&s;ure on the face of day; now it faintly glimmers, like the fog-wrapped moon, and our glorious eagle is become a bird of night."</Q></P>
<P>Now let us &s;ee how the &s;ame &s;ubject may be treated, in oppo&s;ition to this over-charged, bloated, tabernacle harangue; which, delivered in the <HI>Moorfield</HI> manner, mu&s;t prove a laughable mor|&s;el of mirth, to divert common &s;en&s;e, and a&s;toni&s;h ignorance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fellow citizens, there was a time, when li|berty diffu&s;ed its ble&s;&s;ings thro' this once happy i&s;le; when its value was known, and its worth revered; when, like the &s;un, it was a common
<PB N="17" REF="16">
comforter; the parent of plea&s;ure, ea&s;e, and &s;ecurity: now corruption and our own depra|vity have brought it to &s;o enfeebled and preca|rious a &s;tate, that every real friend of his coun|try mu&s;t tremble, as I do, at the painful idea of its &s;peedy and inevitable di&s;&s;olution."</Q></P>
<P>If eloquence (a very dangerous weapon in the hands of ill-de&s;igning men) is u&s;ed to any other purpo&s;es than the following, we may con&s;ider it as in a cen&s;urable &s;tate of perver&s;ion.</P>
<P>It &s;hould enforce the cleare&s;t proof of any u&s;e|ful truth, with &s;uch intere&s;ting motives as may af|fect the hearers, and work their pa&s;&s;ions to virtu|ous purpo&s;es; to rai&s;e indignation again&s;t ingrati|tude; horror again&s;t cruelty; dete&s;tation again&s;t vice; abhorrence again&s;t &s;lavery; compa&s;&s;ion for mi&s;ery; love for virtue; reverence for religion; obedience to &s;uperiors; and benevolence to all. Thus employed, eloquence appears in its full force and beauty: mere harangues &s;eldom fail to catch the ear, but rarely touch the heart, and as &s;eldom inform the head.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary that an orator &s;hould call the pa&s;|&s;ions to his aid; but then he &s;hould be very cau|tious not to impo&s;e on, or a&s;&s;ail, them too violent|ly: the one is cruel, the other impolitic. He &s;hould be clear in his ideas, and conci&s;e in his ex|pre&s;&s;ion: he &s;hould perfectly under&s;tand ju&s;t ar|rangement of matter, and the proper climax of ar|gument: he &s;hould be thoroughly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every principle and part of his &s;ubject: he &s;hould pro|vide a &s;ufficient number of appo&s;ite, affecting figures. Thus prepared, he mu&s;t &s;peak, and ef|fectually, from an untrammel'd imagination.</P>
<P>The following pa&s;&s;ages, from Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI>'s di&s;cour&s;e on the Pa&s;toral Care, &s;eems well calculated
<PB N="18" REF="17">
for the improvement of Lay, as well as Pulpit, &s;peakers.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The extempore orator &s;hould fre|quently conver&s;e with him&s;elf, to let his thoughts flow freely from him; e&s;pecially when he feels an edge and heat upon his mind; for then hap|py expre&s;&s;ions will &s;pontaneou&s;ly come to his mouth. He mu&s;t al&s;o write e&s;&s;ays on all kinds of &s;ubjects; for, by writing, he will bring him|&s;elf to a facility and correctne&s;s of thinking and &s;peaking: and thus, by clo&s;e application for two or three years, a man may render him&s;elf &s;uch a ma&s;ter this way, that he can never be &s;ur|prized; nor will new thoughts ever dry up up|on him. If, in his meditations, happy thoughts and noble pathetic expre&s;&s;ions offer them&s;elves, he mu&s;t not lo&s;e, but write them down."</Q></P>
<P>We perfectly agree with the right reverend Au|thor, that much oratorical merit may be derived from frequent, well-regulated &s;oliloquies, and e&s;&s;ay-writing; and are induced to offer a few more of his thoughts, though not in the exact words nor confined light wherein he has propo&s;ed them.</P>
<P>One mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential point is, that an orator &s;hould have a due and deep &s;en&s;e of the truth and utility of his &s;ubject: he mu&s;t have a life and glow in his thoughts, with relation to it: he &s;hould very &s;en|&s;ibly feel in him&s;elf tho&s;e things which he explains and recommends to others: he &s;hould &s;peak as if what he uttered came from the heart: the orator, unle&s;s he really is, or &s;eems to be, in earne&s;t, will never make any material impre&s;&s;ion. There is a degree of authority, even in the &s;imple&s;t matters that can be treated of, if they appear genuine, while the mo&s;t important points fall into neglect, when conveyed through the cold vehicle of languid expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">For a general well-compacted idea of oratory, we &s;hall refer to &s;ome &s;peeches from FENELON's Dialogue, between DEMOSTHENES and CICERO.</P>

<P>Since you urge the point, I acknowledge it: my compo&s;itions are infinitely more beautified, than thine. They &s;peak far more wit, more in|genuity of turn, more art, more ea&s;e.

<P>Thy ob&s;ervations on both, are true; but the inference drawn from them, is thy mi&s;take. Thou took'&s;t up the audience with thy&s;elf; I engaged it only with the affairs I &s;poke upon.

<P>Mr. RAPIN, in his Reflections upon Eloquence, ob&s;erves, that there are two extremes, which &s;hould be equally and carefully avoided; the frigid &s;tyle, and the boyi&s;h. The former renders di&s;cour&s;es dry and in&s;ipid, by a languid flatne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion; the latter ungrateful and &s;hocking, by a turgid loftine&s;s, and affected amplification. Tho&s;e who u&s;e the frigid &s;tyle, call in pompous expre&s;&s;ions, when the &s;ubject requires plain ones; and they who affect the boyi&s;h one, employ low expre&s;&s;ions in the loftie&s;t themes. The frigid &s;tyle properly includes all &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as are too &s;trong, or too &s;parkling, &s;trained metaphors, and frequent wittici&s;ms: the boyi&s;h &s;tyle comprehends &s;trokes of humour, and quaint conceits, upon &s;erious &s;ubjects; loo&s;e and heavy repetitions, in that part of an oration which ought to be clo&s;e and conci&s;e; too violent exaggerations, and too labo|rious figures.</P>

<P><PB N="22" REF="21">Stage <HI>delivery</HI> (for theatrical expre&s;&s;ion cannot be &s;tiled <HI>oratory</HI>) including more variety, and more force of pa&s;&s;ion, is con&s;equently more diffi|cult. It requires the fine&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;ignificant feelings, in the performer, to create, by &s;ympathy, proper &s;en&s;ations in the audience.</P>
<P>That noble and almo&s;t peculiar &s;en&s;e of human nature, Sympathy, makes us not only &s;hare in the di&s;tre&s;s of a fellow creature, but al&s;o pity the mi&s;erable brute: it varies &s;hapes and &s;trength, ac|cording to the objects and circum&s;tances which occur. There are two principal degrees; &s;ympa|thy of compul&s;ion and &s;ympathy of election: the fir&s;t is, when irre&s;i&s;table motives arre&s;t the heart; the &s;econd, when it becomes intere&s;ted, by choice. Compul&s;ive &s;ympathy in&s;tructs us to &s;igh with &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s love; to kindle with real or well painted rage; to weep with grief; and to mourn for virtue in di&s;tre&s;s: elective &s;ympathy is when we make choice of objects in different &s;ituations, and be|come, without any per&s;onal knowledge or imme|diate concern, anxious for their &s;ucce&s;s: in ca&s;es of competition, whether of a plea&s;urable or of a &s;erious nature, man cannot remain a &s;pectator to|tally indifferent; he mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t one &s;ide or the other, with a &s;ympathetic wi&s;h: in the choice he is free; yet that choice is frequently &s;o capricious, that no firm rea&s;on can be offered, why it becomes fixed.</P>
<P>Imagination is the vehicle which conveys &s;ym|pathy to, and draws it meliorated from, the heart: that which the Theatre rai&s;es, is produced by the bold painting of the Poet's pen, aided by the na|tural and forcible talents of a good Actor; who is, in every &s;entence, an illu&s;trative comment upon his author's idea.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">This is that kind of &s;ympathy, which the inge|nious Dr. SMITH, in his Theory of Moral Senti|ments, de&s;cribes to ari&s;e from the view of emotions in another per&s;on: the pa&s;&s;ions may be transfu&s;ed from one per&s;on to another, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and antecedent to any knowledge of what excited them in the per&s;on principally concerned. Grief and Joy, &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed in the look and ge&s;tures of any one, exclu&s;ive of voice, at once affect the &s;pecta|tor with &s;ome degree of a like painful or agreeable emotion: a &s;miling face is to every one who &s;ees it a cheerful object; as a &s;orrowful countenance, on the other hand, is a melancholy one.</P>
<P>What the ingenious Profe&s;&s;or &s;ays of mankind at large, may be brought to the point we have im|mediately in view. Every faculty in one man, when he judges of propriety, is the mea&s;ure by which he decides upon the like faculty in another: I judge of your &s;ight, by my &s;ight; of your ear, by my ear; of your rea&s;on, by my rea&s;on; of your re|&s;entment, by my re&s;entment; of your love, by my love: I neither have nor can have any other way of judging, about them. This po&s;ition granted, we are not to wonder at the endle&s;s variety of, and frequent ab&s;urd critical opinions upon, the <HI>real</HI> and <HI>mimic</HI> &s;tages of life.</P>
<P>If an actor creates &s;ympathy (which to do &s;hould be his foremo&s;t aim) he will command attention: if not, vain are the be&s;t requi&s;ites, and all the ad|ventitious aids of theatrical decoration.</P>

<P>By laying the <HI>empha&s;is</HI> on <HI>&s;piry,</HI> in the fir&s;t line, the peculiar form of the trees mentioned is ex|plained; whereas, had the &s;tre&s;s been laid upon <HI>firs,</HI> it would leave us at liberty to think upon <HI>oaks, elms,</HI> &amp;c. &s;piry too.&mdash;The word <HI>ari&s;e</HI> is marked, as being the purport of a command; and though, in general, the voice falls, at the end of a line, yet, in this ca&s;e, the meaning re|quires it &s;hould be rai&s;ed, but not too high, nor abruptly.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd line, <HI>vig'rous</HI> is marked as a pro|perty of the cedar: indeed all <HI>epithets,</HI> whether

<P>In the third line, <HI>chill</HI> is di&s;tingui&s;hed as a cha|racteri&s;tic quality of the climate of Lebanon.</P>
<P><HI>Fearle&s;s,</HI> in the fourth line, is pointed out as an extraordinary attribute of a bird; and <HI>conflicting &s;torms</HI> are emphatical, as a proof of that attribute; enlarging the idea much more than the &s;imple word <HI>fearle&s;s,</HI> una&s;&s;i&s;ted, would have done.</P>
<P>In the fifth line, <HI>tow'ring</HI> is di&s;tingui&s;hed as an <HI>epithet</HI>; and <HI>cradle,</HI> which happily de&s;cribes the <HI>&s;tork</HI>'s ne&s;t in that rocking &s;ituation, is pointed out as the motive of the bird's re&s;olution.</P>

<P>After all that can be &s;aid, the degrees of <HI>empha|&s;is</HI> are &s;o many and &s;o variable, that no <HI>preci&s;e</HI> rules can be laid down for their application.&mdash;In <HI>reading</HI> and <HI>declamation,</HI> as in <HI>mu&s;ic,</HI> there mu&s;t be ta&s;te, to give beauty; without it mere rectitude will be mo&s;t unaffectingly in&s;ipid.

<P>Another rea&s;on again&s;t making the Bible an early book among learners, is the frequency of periods, and peculiarity of &s;tyle, in which it differs widely from mo&s;t other compo&s;itions.

In compound words, that are oppo&s;ed to others, the <HI>empha&s;is,</HI> or rather <HI>accent,</HI> properly falls on the di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;yllables: for in&s;tance, The <HI>virtuous</HI> are <HI>mode&s;t</HI>&mdash;the <HI>vicious immode&s;t</HI>&mdash;the <HI>righteous</HI> are <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI>&mdash;the <HI>unrighteous</HI> are <HI>mi|&s;erable.</HI>&mdash;Here I have oppo&s;ed &s;imple to &s;imple, and compound to compound; were the words <HI>im|mode&s;t</HI> and <HI>unrighteous</HI> to be pronounced without oppo&s;ition, the accent would fall upon the <HI>&s;econd</HI> &s;yllable, in&s;tead of the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">In <HI>explanatory empha&s;es</HI> the very &s;ame words are differently marked, according to the writer's de|&s;ign: as, What did my ma&s;ter &s;ay?

<P>Every <HI>empha&s;is</HI> and variation of voice &s;hould be founded on rea&s;on; it may be proper, therefore, to &s;how why the &s;everal parts of the preceding lines are thus di&s;tingui&s;hed. In the fir&s;t age of infancy, the upper notes are mo&s;t de&s;criptive of that tender time, as they are al&s;o of the whimpering &s;chool-boy; and their &s;oftne&s;s likewi&s;e &s;uits the &s;ighing of the lover. The forward confidence of the &s;oldier demands a full-&s;pirited medium; and the corpulent importance, generally imputed to magi&s;tracy, is well pictured by the jolly &s;well of the <HI>ba&s;e</HI> notes, while the feeblene&s;s of fa&s;t declining age calls for the <HI>counter-tenor,</HI> tremulated, as it were, with weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus much for general explanation, which I have delivered in as full and clear a manner as the nature of my de&s;ign would po&s;&s;ibly admit; and, having &s;et forth &s;uch examples as, explained by <HI>teachers,</HI> or carefully inve&s;tigated by <HI>&s;tudents,</HI> may give a full idea of what is intended, I &s;hall pro|ceed to &s;ome brief remarks upon <HI>utterance</HI> and
<PB N="50" REF="49">
<HI>action,</HI> in which, though it is not probable that many will excel, yet mo&s;t may be improved.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, if a voice is naturally har&s;h, great care &s;hould be taken to avoid guttural expre&s;|&s;ion; nor &s;hould the tongue be allowed to play too much between the teeth; the breath, drawn, as it were, from the &s;tomach, and vibrated upon <HI>within</HI> the mouth, will &s;often har&s;h notes, and render them much more tuneable; on the con|trary, a weak &s;hrill voice &s;hould borrow &s;olidity and force from the throat: as too great an expan|&s;ion of the lips is di&s;graceful to the features, &s;o un|natural contraction of them will render expre&s;&s;ion unmeaning and imperfect.</P>
<P><HI>Stops</HI> and <HI>cadences</HI> are a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential point of con&s;ideration, and cannot be better &s;et forth than in the following remarks of a French author:
<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'It is nece&s;&s;ary for us,'
&s;ays he,
'to re&s;pire from time to time, but the voice does not repo&s;e equally at the conclu&s;ion of every &s;en&s;e; in a &s;entence of con&s;iderable length, we re&s;pire at every <HI>comma</HI>; but this &s;hort pau&s;e is made in &s;uch a manner as to &s;how, by the tone of conti|nuance, that we are to go farther, the ear re|maining un&s;atisfied, becau&s;e the pronunciation continues &s;u&s;pended till the &s;entence is completely fini&s;hed; as for example: <HI>At &s;uch a time, the King, having taken the&s;e matters into con&s;ideration, determined,</HI> here Attention is inqui&s;itive to know what follows; the <HI>colon</HI> and <HI>&s;emicolon</HI> are marks of more con&s;iderable re&s;piration, yet &s;till leave Judgment in &s;u&s;pence till the period unfolds the whole, and calls for a concluding cadence.<P>'In every part, or parts of a &s;entence there is elevation and depre&s;&s;ion of the voice, which never ab&s;olutely repo&s;es but at the conclu&s;ion of
<PB N="51" REF="50">
a period, all other re&s;piration being of conti|nuance.'</P></Q></P>
<P>There is undoubtedly much judgment in the compo&s;ition of harmonious and comprehen&s;ive pe|riods; a di&s;&s;onant unconnected &s;tyle will take greatly from the beauty and force of expre&s;&s;ion, as a di&s;cordant piece of mu&s;ic mu&s;t di&s;grace a perfor|mance of the able&s;t ma&s;ter, and injure the utter|ance of the mo&s;t perfect in&s;truments.</P>
<P>Frequent u&s;e &s;trengthens and meliorates the or|gans of expre&s;&s;ion, and practice will teach a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential point, that of pitching the voice to any place or number of per&s;ons. There is con&s;idera|ble nicety in knowing the different effect which the &s;ame notes of voice may have in places of equal dimen&s;ions, but of different con&s;truction, of a place containing but few auditors, or thronged with a large number; and this point of excellence mu&s;t be attained by much practice and ob&s;ervation. Only thus much may be ob&s;erved in general of the operations of &s;ound; that where it undulates con|&s;iderably, the louder a <HI>reader</HI> or <HI>declaimer</HI> goes beyond the ju&s;t pitch, the more indi&s;tinct he will be, of which we find very frequent in&s;tances in <HI>cathedral</HI> churches: a full audience in any place will require at lea&s;t twice the force of expre&s;&s;ion of a thin one; which, exclu&s;ive of &s;ome buzz that mu&s;t unavoidably attend a numerous a&s;&s;embly, may be philo&s;ophically accounted for by an e&s;&s;en|tial den&s;ity of air, from the conjunct re&s;piration of &s;o many people.</P>
<P>The voice being pitched, and modulated thro' the &s;everal variations which may be found nece&s;&s;ary, it remains to con&s;ider, to comprehend, and to feel the &s;ubject; without which expre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be languid, unaffecting, and weari&s;ome. What we
<PB N="52" REF="51">
<HI>read</HI> or <HI>&s;peak</HI> unfelt, mu&s;t be like painting with|out light or &s;hade; there may be ju&s;t &s;ymmetry of parts and good colouring; but unle&s;s they are rai&s;ed and brought forward, both pall on the view, and die upon the canva&s;s.</P>
<P>Spirit and feeling are nece&s;&s;ary to idea as well as to &s;ight; for which rea&s;on <HI>teachers</HI> &s;hould not only make their <HI>pupils</HI> under&s;tand every word they <HI>read,</HI> but their general &s;en&s;e in a &s;tate of connec|tion: a point of care &s;eldom attended to.</P>
<P>Emphatic expre&s;&s;ion, feeling, and ta&s;te, are par|ticularly e&s;&s;ential to poetry, as that, in general, appeals oftner to the pa&s;&s;ions than any other &s;pecies of writing. <HI>Cadences</HI> al&s;o are more critical in num|bers than in pro&s;e; in both they &s;hould be &s;mooth, gradual, and die away almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly, yet &s;o as to pre&s;erve and to impre&s;s the la&s;t &s;yllable both upon the ear and mind, without &s;napping &s;hort the breath or &s;ound, which is extremely grating to a judicious hearer.</P>
<P>How often is ver&s;e of every kind mi&s;erably mangled! A &s;ort of unmeaning pedantic recitative, tedious from a repetition of mi&s;placed unharmonious tones, is &s;ub&s;tituted for dignity; thus we find many, who make a tolerable &s;hift with pro&s;e, the moment they &s;ee any number of mea&s;ured &s;yllables, throw a&s;ide nature, rea&s;on, nay even common &s;en&s;e, to di&s;play their knowledge of ver&s;ification, and what they think its peculiar importance.&mdash;What can be more ab&s;urd? Genuine poetry needs no pom|pous affectation to dignify it; for as by tran&s;po&s;ing the words you cannot reduce it to pro&s;e, neither can you take from its harmony by plain, natural expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I know not any thing which has done our lan|guage, and the reading of it, more injury than the
<PB N="53" REF="52">
gingle of rhime, e&s;pecially that which is thrown into heroic mea&s;ure, it being certain that the more correct an author in that way is, the more he will lead to monotony. In&s;tance Mr. Pope, who has been &s;o critically exact in accenting particular &s;yl|lables, that very few of his pieces can be read with any tolerable variation of voice; for which rea&s;on I would have learners kept from rhime in heroic mea&s;ure till they are well grounded in a ju&s;t mode of utterance. Indeed we are not to wonder that the <HI>generality</HI> chaunt ver&s;e in &s;o lamentable a man|ner, when &s;ome of tho&s;e who have &s;ketched rules for reading, in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch a &s;ervile obedience to the author, as not only to change the accented &s;yllable, but even to favour his bad rhime, with fal&s;e pronunciation; for example, to &s;ound the la&s;t &s;yllable of <HI>liberty,</HI> as an exact <HI>rhime</HI> either to <HI>flee</HI> or <HI>fly.</HI>&mdash;To pre&s;cribe a &s;top or half pau&s;e at the end of a line, whether the &s;en&s;e requires it or not, is another rule that has been given, equally erro|neous and di&s;gu&s;tful.</P>
<P>In <HI>reading,</HI> properly &s;o called, <HI>action</HI> has no concern, but <HI>declamation</HI> is very defective without it; yet, except upon the <HI>&s;tage,</HI> and among many there mi&s;erably methodized, we &s;carce find any.&mdash;When I recommend <HI>action,</HI> I would not be &s;uppo&s;ed to intend that a &s;peaker &s;hould be in continual motion; or that, puppet-like, he is to lift up fir&s;t one hand and then another, merely to lay them down again.&mdash;No&mdash;I would have motions few, ea&s;y, graceful; and, for my own part, I know not how a declaimer can po&s;&s;ibly feel and &s;tand &s;tock-&s;till: but, admit the po&s;&s;ibility of this, I will venture to &s;ay there is but little probability that his audience will think him in earne&s;t: I know that &s;ome delicate per&s;ons are afraid of be|coming
<PB N="54" REF="53">
too <HI>theatrical</HI>; but there is a very wide difference between the <HI>action</HI> of an <HI>orator</HI> and an <HI>actor,</HI> unle&s;s when the latter judiciou&s;ly repre&s;ents the former; but I &s;hall no further urge the nece&s;|&s;ity of a point &s;o obvious, let us proceed to the thing it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, <HI>action</HI> &s;hould be entirely re&s;erved for tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which contain &s;omewhat inte|re&s;ting or important, as demon&s;tration, or the en|forcing of a charge. This &s;hould be attended with the right arm &s;tretched forward to the full extent, the fingers even, and the palm of the hand downwards, or &s;ometimes the hand turned &s;ide|ways, the fore finger only pointing: if the cir|cum&s;tance demon&s;trated, or given in charge, be very momentous, the well known and admired action of St. Paul preaching at Athens, &s;tretching forth both arms, palms downwards, has much force and propriety.</P>
<P>Where <HI>grief</HI> is to be expre&s;&s;ed, the right hand laid &s;lowly to the left brea&s;t, the head and che&s;t bending forward, is a ju&s;t indication of it. To expre&s;s <HI>confidence</HI> and <HI>re&s;olution,</HI> the &s;ame hand mu&s;t move to the &s;ame place, but with quickne&s;s and vigour, recoiling as it were from the heart, which thereby &s;eems to meet it. With this action the head &s;hould be thrown back and the che&s;t for|ward. The expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>ardent affection,</HI> is to clo&s;e both hands warmly at half arm's length, the fingers intermingling, and to bring them to the brea&s;t with &s;pirit. If <HI>expan&s;ion</HI> of <HI>mind,</HI> or any thing &s;imilar, is to be pointed out, then both arms &s;hould be ca&s;t different ways, in a parallel line, and the che&s;t thrown open. Folding arms, with a drooping of the head, de&s;cribe contemplation; erection of the head &s;peaks dignity, or, with &s;uit|able

There are &s;ome few other in&s;tances of action which may be graceful, and &s;erves for variation, though not ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary; but the&s;e mu&s;t be left to the choice and di&s;cretion of the declaimer, and to the uncon|&s;trained operation of judicious feeling: only thus much it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the left hand &s;hould &s;eldom or never be u&s;ed by it&s;elf; and that all action &s;hould move between the tip of the &s;houlder and the &s;eat of the heart; all above is what Shake&s;peare ju&s;tly &s;tyles &s;awing the air; all below both unmeaning and ungraceful. Upon the whole, every motion &s;hould be the natural attendant of what is &s;poken: if an extreme cannot be avoided, I would rather recommend <HI>no</HI> action than <HI>too much,</HI> or than &s;uch as mu&s;t offend judici|ous eyes.&mdash;<HI>Attitudes,</HI> or po&s;itions of the body, when happily &s;truck off and well applied, are not only picture&s;que but &s;triking, all de&s;cription of them with a pen mu&s;t be faint and confu&s;ed, where|fore we refer to the pencil of &s;ome able painter.</P>
<P>To what has been already offer'd we &s;hall &s;ub|join &s;ome u&s;eful remarks from an ingenious Trea|ti&s;e on the Art of Speaking.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"If nature, una&s;&s;i&s;ted, could form the eminent &s;peaker, where were the u&s;e of art and culture? which no one pretends to que&s;tion: art is but na|ture improved upon and refined; and before im|provement is applied, genius is but a ma&s;s of ore in the mine, without lu&s;tre and without value, be|cau&s;e unknown and unthought of: the ancients u&s;ed to procure ma&s;ters for pronunciation from the theatres, and had youth taught ge&s;ture and attitude, by the Palae&s;tritae, who taught much the &s;ame among them, as dancing-ma&s;ters do among us.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="55">"It is well when a youth has no natural impedi|ment or defect in his &s;pecch; and I &s;hould by no means advi&s;e that he who has, be brought up to any profe&s;&s;ion requiring elocution; yet there are in&s;tances of natural defects &s;urmounted; and emi|nent &s;peakers formed by indefatigable diligence in &s;pite of them; DEMOSTHENES when he began to &s;tudy rhetoric, could not pronounce the fir&s;t letter of the name of that art; and CICERO was long-necked and narrow che&s;ted; but diligent labour, in what we are earne&s;t upon, &s;urmounts all diffi|culties, that are not too deeply rooted in nature: for want of proper application we are frequently di&s;gu&s;ted by public &s;peakers li&s;ping, &s;tammering, and &s;peaking thro' the no&s;e; pronouncing the letter k with the throat, in&s;tead of the tongue, s like th, and &s;creaming above, or croaking below all natural pitch of human voice.</P>
<P>Some unexperienced attempters at oratory mum|ble as if they were conjuring up &s;pirits; others bawl as loud as &s;treet hawkers; &s;ome &s;o precipi|tate in expre&s;&s;ion that no ear can di&s;tingui&s;h; others drag words like the heavy pau&s;es of a great clock &s;triking; &s;ome have got a di&s;agreeable habit of &s;hrugging up their &s;houlders; others of &s;ee-&s;awing their bodies backwards and forwards, or from &s;ide to &s;ide; &s;ome open their mouths frightfully, others keep their teeth &s;o clo&s;e as if the jaws were &s;et; all which, with many other bad, di&s;graceful habits, &s;hould either be got the better of in early life, or the young per&s;ons put into &s;ome other path than that of public &s;peaking: neglect of this, occa&s;ions &s;uch confirmation of deficiency, that not one &s;peaker in twenty knows what to do with his hands, voice, or eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="56">"Some actors, who &s;hould mo&s;t particularly ap|ply to feeling and attention, who &s;hould mo&s;t &s;trictly regard decorum, are guilty of mon&s;trous improprieties as to management of the eyes in par|ticular; to look full at the audience when &s;peak|ing a &s;oliloquy, or a &s;peech a&s;ide, is intolerable; a performer &s;hould not in theatrical &s;tation &s;eem con&s;cious of an audience, or that there is a &s;pec|tator looking on; and one peculiar fault in per|formers is, that they don't in general keep a fixed eye on tho&s;e they &s;peak to, even in impa&s;&s;ioned dialogue: from whatever cau&s;e we may derive this di&s;graceful, enfeebling inattention, it is &s;everely cen&s;urable."</P></Q></P>
<P>It being far beyond the limits of our de&s;ign to enter upon the general minutiae of our &s;ubject, we refer our readers for a circum&s;tantial de&s;cription of the effects which various affections and pa&s;&s;ions have upon the human features, to the &s;tudious treati&s;e we have ju&s;t now quoted from; publi&s;hed by LONGMAN and BUCKLAND, Pater-no&s;ter-row; though we think great part of it more curious than u&s;eful, for where the mind by nature, or repre&s;en|tation properly feels, the features will operate con|&s;onantly; if words and looks are contrary, no &s;ym|pathy can be gained; in which ca&s;e the main point is lo&s;t.</P>
