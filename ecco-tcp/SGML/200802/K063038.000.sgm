<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>Ttho&s;e who judge of dramatic merit from the Greek models, the rules of French critics, or the examples of modern writers, a ju&s;tifica|tion of the following piece would be attempted in vain. They would call it a motley perfor|mance, deficient in almo&s;t every article, which con&s;titutes a true and proper tragedy. If the author was to alledge, that he never meant to compo&s;e a tragedy, according to their accep|tation of the word, but that his intention was to fill up a picture of real life, in a certain given time, the outlines of which were taken from hi&s;torical facts, his rea&s;on would be deemed un|&s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>Regardle&s;s of the end propo&s;ed, they would continue to exclaim, that the unities were neg|lected, that the grave was intermingled with the ludicrous; that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the drama frequently &s;tood &s;till; that the dialogue was too familiar, and the metre little better than mea|&s;ured pro&s;e.</P>
<P>How far &s;ome of the&s;e objections may be valid, and how many more might, perhaps, with
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
rea&s;on be urged again&s;t particular pa&s;&s;ages, the author would not determine. The force of others of them he would endeavour to dimi|ni&s;h, by an&s;wering, that they militate equally again&s;t human life it&s;elf; and that while he &s;hould be &s;orry to have this denominated an ar|tificial poem, he would flatter him&s;elf, it cannot be ju&s;tly thought an unnatural one.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on indeed, in the preface to his edi|tion of Shake&s;peare, &s;eems to have &s;ufficiently vindicated this particular &s;pecies of writing, to which, tho&s;e who plea&s;e, may (in&s;tead of tra|gedy) give the more &s;imple name of hi&s;tory. Neither are there wanting many good judges of compo&s;ition, who wi&s;h that the le&s;s &s;tudied diction, and more plain and level metre of the &s;chool of that immortal poet, (which &s;eems to have ended with Southern) had been conti|nued to the pre&s;ent time. Even this perfor|mance, with all its imputed irregularities and deficiencies, will, perhaps, be preferred by them, to tho&s;e tran&s;lated tragedies or imitations, which of late years have, through novelty, lived their nine nights on the &s;tage, and been damned for ever after in the clo&s;et: tho' they had been cor|rected and metamorpho&s;ed by managers, calcu|lated to afford to favourite actors or actre&s;&s;es op|portunities of &s;hining, and curtailed by lord chamberlains.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5">
A diver&s;ification of characters hath been at|tempted in this piece; and to give to every cha|racter the mode of &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion, peculiarly &s;uited to it. It is not at all difficult for a man of a very middling genius, to contrive a regular plot, to pen down a certain number of &s;ounding lines; and though his Dramatis Per|&s;onae are di&s;tingui&s;hed by particular names, to put his own &s;entiments in their mouths through|out five acts. Had the author been &s;olicitous of adapting his plan to the &s;tage, or wi&s;hed to conciliate the favour of the indi&s;criminating multitude, he might probably have followed the &s;ame method.</P>
<P>However it may appear to us, when we are reading, no &s;mall attention is requi&s;ite in writ|ten dialogue of any kind, for an author entirely to ca&s;t off &s;elf. This was the characteri&s;tic of Shake&s;peare; and perhaps after all, the author of this play hath deceived him&s;elf, and it may with rea&s;on be applied to him.</P>

<L>YES, we may weep the ruin of our country,</L>
<L>And &s;o mu&s;t all good men; but there's no remedy;</L>
<L>The evil is too rank t' admit a cure.</L>

<L>Our own, much le&s;s our words. The &s;ecret cur&s;e</L>
<L>Is frequent, offer'd up to all the gods</L>
<L>The midnight &s;ilent deprecation calls</L>
<L>For vengeance on the proud, the imperious Tarquin.</L>
<L>But in the day each wears the face of loyalty,</L>
<L>Nor dares, &s;o jealous are the&s;e groveling times,</L>
<L>E'en in his brother's bo&s;om pour the &s;ecret</L>
<L>Which ulcerating preys upon his heart.</L>
<L>How we two thus have dared communicate</L>

In honour's &s;teady cour&s;e, invariably</L>

<SPEAKER>LUCRETIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! He was placed above</L>

<L>Th' heroic ardor which inflames the brea&s;t</L>
<L>Of con&s;cious greatne&s;s, and uplifts mankind</L>
<L>To &s;omething of divinity, dwelt in him.</L>
<L>He was a man, that had he '&s;caped the wreck</L>

<L>At lea&s;t &s;ome check he would have been, &s;ome curb</L>
<L>Upon the mouth of head&s;trong appetite,</L>
