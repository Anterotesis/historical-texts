<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THAT great Philo&s;opher, and Honour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, the Lord Chancellor <HI>Bacon,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> on <HI>Deformity.</HI></NOTE> gives it us as his Opinion, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That <HI>Deformed Per&s;ons</HI> are commonly <HI>even</HI> with <HI>Nature,</HI> for as <HI>Nature</HI> hath done <HI>ill</HI> by them, &s;o <HI>do</HI> they by <HI>Nature,</HI> being for the mo&s;t part (as the Scripture &s;aith) <HI>void of natural Affection,</HI> and &s;o they have Revenge of Nature. Certainly, there is a Con&s;ent between the Body and the Mind, and where <HI>Nature</HI> erreth in the one, &s;he ventureth in the other;&mdash;<HI>Ubi</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
<HI>peccat in uno, periclatur in altero.</HI> But becau&s;e there is in Man an Election touch|ing the Frame of his Mind, and a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity in the Frame of his Body; the Stars of natural Inclination are &s;ometimes ob&s;cured by the Sun of Di&s;cipline and Virtue: Therefore it is good to con&s;ider <HI>Deformity,</HI> not as a Sign which is more deceivable, but as a Cau&s;e which &s;eldom faileth of the Effect. Who&s;oever hath any thing fixed in his Per&s;on that doth induce Contempt, hath al&s;o a perpetual Spur in him&s;elf, to re&s;cue and deliver him&s;elf from Scorn. Therefore all <HI>De|formed Per&s;ons</HI> are extreme Bold. Fir&s;t, in their own Defence, as being expo&s;ed to Scorn; but in Proce&s;s of Time, by a Ge|neral Habit. Al&s;o it &s;tirreth in them In|du&s;try, and e&s;pecially of this kind, to watch and ob&s;erve the Weakne&s;s of others, that they may have &s;omewhat to repay. Again, in their Superiors, it quencheth Jealou&s;y towards them, as Per&s;ons that they think they may at Plea&s;ure de&s;pi&s;e; and it layeth their Competitors and Emu|lators a&s;leep, as never believing they &s;hould be in a Po&s;&s;ibility of Advance|ment, till they &s;ee them in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;o that upon the Matter, in a great Wit, <HI>Deformity</HI> is an Advantage to ri&s;ing; Kings in antient Times (and at this pre&s;ent in
<PB N="vii" REF="8" MS="y">
&s;ome Countries) were wont to put great Tru&s;t in <HI>Eunuchs;</HI> becau&s;e they that are envious towards All, are more obnoxious and officious towards One. But yet their Tru&s;t towards them hath rather been as to good Spyals, and good Whi&s;perers, than good Magi&s;trates and Officers; and much like is the Rea&s;on of <HI>Deformed Per&s;ons.</HI> Still the Ground is, they will, if they be of Spirit, &s;eek to free them&s;elves from Scorn, which mu&s;t be either by Virtue or Malice; and therefore, let it not be marvelled, if &s;ometimes they prove ex|cellent Per&s;ons; as was <HI>Age&s;ilaus, Zanger</HI> the Son of <HI>Solyman, Ae&s;op, Ga&s;ca,</HI> Pre&s;i|dent of <HI>Peru;</HI> and <HI>Socrates</HI> may go like|wi&s;e among&s;t them; with others.'</Q></P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip ob&s;erves, that the&s;e Men were In&s;tances of the mo&s;t exalted Virtue; but I wi&s;h I was not obliged to &s;ay, that You are a Precedent of the mo&s;t depraved Vice. For a Demon&s;tration of which, I &s;hall regularly proceed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>You very well know, Sir, that in the Year 1717, when the <HI>Court-Poems,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Ba&s;&s;et-Table,</HI> The <HI>Toilet,</HI> and The <HI>Drawing-Room</HI>) were publi&s;hed, upon your &s;ending for me to the <HI>Swan-Tavern</HI> in <HI>Fleet|&s;treet,</HI> in Company with Mr. <HI>Lintot,</HI> and en|quiring into the Publication of that Pam|phlet, I then frankly told you, that tho&s;e

For this you were plea&s;ed to treat me, with half a Pint of Canary, antimonially prepared; for the emetic Effects of which, it has been the Opinion of all Mankind, you de|&s;erved the Stab. My Purgation was &s;oon over, but yours will la&s;t (without a timely Repentance) till, as the <HI>Gho&s;t</HI> &s;ays in <HI>Ham|let; with all your Imperfections on your Head you are called to your Accompt; and your Of|fences purged by Fire.</HI> Yet notwith&s;tanding your Behaviour to me, in turning this Mat|ter into Ridicule, and making me the Sub|ject of &s;everal of your Libels, all which I have equally de&s;pi&s;ed, I made you an Offer of Reconciliation, tho' You your&s;elf was the Aggre&s;&s;or.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Evidenced by my Letter of the 22d of March la&s;t.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>A True NARRATIVE of the Method by which Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s Letters have been publi&s;hed.</HEAD>

<P>This will be made &s;o plain by the en&s;uing Papers, that it will &s;carce be needful to attend them with any Reflexi|ons, more than what every Reader may make.</P>
<P>In the Year 1727, <HI>Edmund Curll,</HI> Book&s;eller, publi&s;h|ed a Collection of &s;everal private Letters of Mr <HI>Pope</HI> to <HI>Henry Cromwell,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> which he obtained in this Manner.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Cromwell</HI> was acquainted with one Mrs <HI>Thomas,</HI> to whom he had the Indi&s;cretion to lend the&s;e Letters, and who falling into Misfortunes &s;even Years after, &s;old them to Mr <HI>Curll,</HI> without the Con&s;ent either of Mr <HI>Pope</HI> or Mr <HI>Cromwell</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e Letters were a free Gift; &s;o that there was not any Occa&s;ion to a&s;k the Con&s;ent of either of tho&s;e Parties.

<P>This Treatment being extreamly di&s;agreeable to Mr <HI>Pope,</HI> he was advi&s;ed to re-call any Letters which might happen to be pre&s;erved by any of his Friends, particularly tho&s;e written to Per&s;ons decea&s;ed, which would be mo&s;t &s;ubject to &s;uch an Accident.

<P>To this Purpo&s;e, an Amanuen&s;is or two were employed by Mr <HI>Pope,</HI> when the Books were in the Country, and by the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> when they were in Town.</P>

The&s;e were accordingly tran&s;cribed for the Pre&s;s from the <HI>Manu&s;cript Books</HI> above-mentioned.</P>
<P>They were no &s;ooner printed but <HI>Edmund Curll</HI> looked on the&s;e too as his Property; for a Copy is extant, which he corrected in order for another Impre&s;&s;ion, interlin'd, and added marginal Notes to, in his own Hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is another Fal&s;hood, Mr <HI>Curll</HI> only gave a Copy of this Pamphlet to <HI>R.S.</HI> to &s;hew <HI>P.T.</HI> that he had reprinted tho&s;e Letters which came out in 1728, and corrected the <HI>Errata</HI> therein.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>IN pur&s;uance to your Adverti&s;ement de|&s;iring &s;uch Accounts of Mr <HI>Pope as his De&s;erts demand,</HI> I &s;end you the&s;e <HI>Anecdotes,</HI> the Truth of which I can te&s;tify (and will, if called upon) as having been his School|fellow my &s;elf at the time.</P>
<P>The fact is very remarkable, as it is a proof of that <HI>natural &s;pleen</HI> which con&s;ti|tutes his <HI>Temperament,</HI> and from which he has never deviated in the whole cour&s;e of his Life.</P>
<P>The la&s;t School he was put to, before the twelfth Year of his Age, was in <HI>De|von&s;hire-Street</HI> near <HI>Bloom&s;bury,</HI> there I al&s;o was, and the late Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> at the &s;ame time. It was kept by one <HI>Bromley,</HI> a <HI>Popi&s;h Renegado,</HI> who had been a Par|&s;on, and was one of <HI>King James's</HI> Con|verts in <HI>Oxford,</HI> &s;ome Years after that Prince's Abdication; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Name was <HI>William Bromley,</HI> Son of <HI>Henry Brom|ley,</HI> of <HI>Holt</HI> in <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> He was entered a Gen|tleman-Commoner of Chri&s;t-Church-College, <HI>Oxon,</HI> 1673.

him, he went a <HI>Travelling-Tutor</HI> to the pre&s;ent Lord <HI>Gage.</HI></P>
<P>Mr <HI>Alexander Pope</HI> before he had been four Months at this School (or was able to con&s;true <HI>Tully's Offices</HI>) employed his Mu&s;e in &s;atirizing his Ma&s;ter. It was a Libel of at lea&s;t one hundred Ver&s;es, which a Fellow-Student having given information of, was found in his pocket, and the young Satiri&s;t was &s;oundly whipp'd, and kept a Pri&s;oner to his Room &s;even days; where|upon his Father fetch'd him away, and I have been told, he never went to School more.</P>
<P>How much <HI>pa&s;t Correction</HI> has wrought upon him, the World is Judge; and how much <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Correction might, may be collected from this &s;ample. I thought it a curious Fact, and therefore it is at your &s;ervice, as one of the Ornaments of this excellent Per&s;on's Life.</P>

<P>I was well acquainted with his Father, and with the fir&s;t part of his own Life, tho' &s;ince he hath treated me as a Stran|ger.</P>
<P>It is certain &s;ome late Pamphlets are not fair in re&s;pect to his Father.

He was as he hath told Me him&s;elf, [and he was very different from his Son, a mode&s;t and plain hone&s;t Man] a Po&s;thumous Son, and left little provided for, his elder Bro|ther having what &s;mall E&s;tate there was, who afterwards &s;tudied and died at <HI>Ox|ford.</HI> He was put to a Merchant in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> and acquired a moderate Fortune by Merchandize, which he quitted, at the Re|volution, in very good Circum&s;tances, and retired to <HI>Wind&s;or-Fore&s;t,</HI> where he pur|cha&s;ed a &s;mall E&s;tate, and took great de|light

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Troubled you with a Line &s;ome time &s;ince, concerning your de&s;ign of the Life of Mr <HI>Pope:</HI> to which I de&s;ired your An&s;wer in <HI>the Daily Adverti&s;er</HI> of <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 18th. In&s;t. <HI>Oct.</HI> I do not intend my &s;elf any other Profit in it, than that of doing Ju&s;tice to, and on, that Per&s;on, upon whom, Sir, you have con&s;tantly be&s;towed &s;ome Care, as well as Pains in the Cour&s;e of your Life; and I intend him the like for his Conduct towards me.</P>
<P><HI>A propos,</HI> to his Life, there have lately fal|len into my hands a large Collection of his Letters, from the former part of his Days till the Year 1727, which being more con|&s;iderable than any yet &s;een, and opening very many Scenes new to the World, will alone make a perfect and the mo&s;t Au|thentic Life and Memoirs of him that could be.</P>
<P>To &s;how you my Sincerity and deter|minate Re&s;olution of a&s;&s;i&s;ting you herein,

I will give you an Adverti&s;ement which you may publi&s;h, if you plea&s;e, forthwith; and, on your &s;o doing, the Letters &s;hall be &s;ent you. They will make a four of five Shilling Book; yet I expect no more than what will barely pay a Tran&s;criber, that the Originals may be pre&s;erved in mine, or your Hands, to vouch the Truth of them.</P>
<P>I am of opinion the&s;e alone will contain his whole Hi&s;tory (if you add to them, what you formerly printed of tho&s;e to <HI>H.

The old Gentleman, P.T. not calling upon me, I did not put the <HI>Adverti&s;ement,</HI> into any News-Paper, and this whole Tran&s;action lay dormant near two Years. But upon regulating &s;ome Papers in my Scritoire, about the Clo&s;e of <HI>March</HI> 1735, this <HI>Adverti&s;ement</HI> came to my Hands, and reflecting within my &s;elf that the Re|&s;entment between Mr <HI>Pope</HI> and me, tho' from the fir&s;t ungenerou&s;ly taken up by him, had continued much too long, being al|mo&s;t eight Years, I was willing to lay hold of an Opportunity for propo&s;ing an Ac|commodation. Accordingly, I wrote to Mr <HI>Pope</HI> and inclo&s;ed the abovementioned <HI>Adverti&s;ement</HI> in the Hand-writing of P.T. and de&s;ired his An&s;wer which he thought fit in a very ungentleman-like Manner to return me in three Papers, viz the <HI>Grub-Street Journal.</HI> The <HI>Daily Journal,</HI> and the <HI>Daily Po&s;t-Boy;</HI> in the la&s;t of which I replied <HI>April</HI> 5th.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Appendix</HI> No. I. and II.</NOTE></P>

But on the Day appointed I received a Countermand, that he thought he had lo&s;t his Wits by making &s;uch an Appointment, and &s;eemed in a terrible Pa|nic le&s;t Mr <HI>Pope</HI> &s;hould &s;end &s;ome of his <HI>Twickenham-Bravoes,</HI> to a&s;&s;ault us; but how Mr <HI>Pope</HI> was to know of this Meeting is the Cream of the Je&s;t.

<P>AS SOON as I heard of our Misfor|tune of the Books being &s;eiz'd, I po&s;ted away to P.T. he &s;aid he found his great Caution was but nece&s;&s;ary: but tho' he knew Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s Intere&s;t with the Great, he apprehended only his per&s;onal Re|venge, or a Chancery Suit; (knowing he would &s;pare no Co&s;t to gratify his Re|venge)
<PB N="20" REF="52">
he &s;aid, if you had been more cautious, than to <HI>name Lords</HI> in your Adverti&s;ement, this could not have hap|pen'd; but &s;ince it has happen'd, you &s;hall not only find him punctual, but <HI>Gene|rous.</HI> He immediately &s;ent me with Money to pay off the Printer, and I have the whole Impre&s;&s;ion in my hands: I then found that the Rogue had deliver'd your la&s;t Parcel imperfect: but I will bring you both tho&s;e Sheets, and the whole Impre&s;&s;ion, the very fir&s;t day they can be &s;afely deliver'd you.</P>
<P>P.T. &s;ays he never intended any more Advantage, but meerly not to be out of pocket. (Except you had been willing to gra|tify me a little), but now he will be Ju&s;t, and act hand&s;omely to you, tho' ever &s;o much to his own Lo&s;s: provided you keep &s;ecret our whole Tran&s;action&mdash;As it is plain that <HI>Pope</HI>'s whole Point is only to <HI>&s;uppre&s;s the Books,</HI> and find out <HI>who gave the Letters.</HI> You will intirely di&s;appoint him in both, if, whatever Que&s;tions the Lords a&s;k, you will an&s;wer no more than thus: <HI>that you had the Letters</HI> from <HI>different Hands,</HI> &s;ome of which you <HI>paid</HI> for, that <HI>you printed the&s;e as you did Mr Cromwell's</HI> before, without Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s ever <HI>gain&s;aying</HI> it; and that as to the <HI>Originals, many you can</HI>

<HI>&s;hew now,</HI> and the re&s;t you can <HI>very &s;peedily.</HI></P>
<P>It is well that an Accident hinders you at pre&s;ent from the Originals, which now, they would &s;eize. P.T. thinks it was indi&s;creet to adverti&s;e the Originals &s;o very quick as the fir&s;t Day, until you ac|tually had them, which by his own fal|ling ill, he cou'd not come at &s;o &s;oon in the place where they lay.</P>
<P>The Lords cannot &s;top the Books above two or three Days, if at all.</P>
<P>And P.T's wonderful Caution as it hap|pens, will enable you to &s;ell them what|ever Orders they may make. For he, apprehending Injunctions in Chancery might &s;uppre&s;s the Book, had already prin|ted <HI>another Title and Preface,</HI> which throws the Publication intirely off you, and might be &s;afely vended even in that Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, if you ab&s;olutely conceal all that has pa&s;&s;ed between P.T. Me, and Your &s;elf, you win the old Gentleman for ever. For his whole Heart is &s;et upon publi&s;hing the Letters, not &s;o much for this Volume as, <HI>in Ordine ad</HI> to much more important Corre&s;pondence that will follow, <HI>viz.</HI> with SWIFT, late Lord OX....D Bp.

<P>All that <HI>P.T.</HI> can apprehend is that <HI>Pope</HI> may obtain an Injunction in Chan|cery, again&s;t <HI>E. Curll</HI> by Name, not|with&s;tanding which, tho&s;e Books may be &s;elling, which have not your Name, with the Preface which he provided for that Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>And you cannot but ob&s;erve when you read that Preface, that at the &s;ame Time, that it makes you not Publi&s;her, it yet proves your Right to <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s <HI>Letters.</HI></P>
<P>This is as lucky as can be, and <HI>Pope</HI> cannot obtain an Injunction without own|ing him&s;elf, in the Bill, Author of the Let|ters, which will &s;erve you to prove the Let|ters genuine.</P>
<P>If you ob&s;erve all the old Gentleman's Directions you will &s;oon be fully acquaint|ed both with his Per&s;on and De&s;igns; in the mean Time, to &s;hew you he will take off the Ma&s;k, and clear the <HI>My&s;terium magnum</HI> you complain of, I have his Leave to tell you the&s;e things which he would have, writ to you him&s;elf, but
<PB N="24" REF="56" MS="y">
that his Arm is now di&s;abled by the Rheumati&s;m.</P>
<P>He is no Man of Quality, but conver&s;ant with many, and happening to be concern'd with a noble Lord (a Friend of Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s) in handing to the Pre&s;s his Letters to <HI>Wy|cherley,</HI> he got &s;ome Copies over and above. This Incident put fir&s;t into his Head the Thought of collecting more, and afterwards finding you did not comply in printing his Adverti&s;ement, he went on with it by him|&s;elf. Found <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s An&s;wers in the &s;ame Lord's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, with many others, which he printed as near as po&s;&s;ible to corre&s;pond with the Letter and Paper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervations he made in &s;ome Pa|ragraphs <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were nece&s;&s;ary, the &s;ame things being repeated in other Letters, either of this or the next Volume, particu|larly the Original of the Letter to Mr <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> is in his Hand.</P>

Yet further, we are certainly inform'd that you have nam'd me as the Hand that convey'd them. This you've &s;aid, that I was a Clergyman belonging to <HI>C.

He has po&s;itively enjoyn'd me not to tru&s;t my &s;elf with you till better A&s;&s;urance: and the be&s;t way for my Part that I know you can give any A&s;&s;urance is, to &s;end the 20 pound fir&s;t, to <HI>Dicks Coffee-Hou&s;e,</HI> in a Note on Mr <HI>Hoare,</HI> by 10 to-morrow morning; and to &s;how P.T. that you tru&s;t him as ab&s;olutely in that &s;mall Sum, as he has

done you in a much greater. As &s;oon as you do this (and not before) he'll &s;end all the things you de&s;ire, which I believe he would never have done after your naming me, and coming &s;o near, as <HI>Southwark,</HI> but for his being &s;o earne&s;t to have the Book publi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>In one Word he has put it upon this Te&s;t.</P>

<P>ABOUT the Time that Mr <HI>Wycherley</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> I troubled you with a Letter of mine, in hopes of prevailing with you to continue, the Favour of your's. But I now write, to convince you that Si|lence is not always the &s;ure&s;t Guard again&s;t Impertinence: I have too great a Sen&s;e of tho&s;e many Civilities receiv'd from you, to de&s;i&s;t from expre&s;&s;ing it, till I receive more: For you not only have acquainted me with many of my Errors in &s;cribbling, but with &s;ome in my Conduct; and I owe to you the Knowledge of Things infinitely more of Concern to my&s;elf, than any thing of mine can be to others. The Advantage I have obtain'd from both might endanger your be|ing put upon an endle&s;s Trouble of criti|cizing on the re&s;t of my Faults, and there|fore you have rea&s;on to make &s;ome delay with tho&s;e now under your Examination. Tho' I never cou'd expect you &s;hou'd once look up|on them, but when you were perfectly at Lei&s;ure; yet &s;o much A&s;&s;urance your for|mer Kindne&s;s had given me, that I was un|der &s;ome Apprehen&s;ions for your Health, on

And I had certainly been there before this Time, had it been in my Pow|er to comply with his mo&s;t obliging Invi|tation, and my De&s;ires of &s;eeing him and you.

<P>_THE pre&s;ent Age, by a &s;trange Revolution of Manners great|ly re&s;embles tho&s;e Profligate, Corrupt, Debauched, Vicious, and Abandoned Times in which <HI>Titus Petronius Arbiter</HI> lived, and of which he has given &s;o warm and lively a De&s;cription in his <HI>Satire.</HI> That part relating to the <HI>Fea&s;t</HI> of <HI>Trimalchio</HI> remained, through the Injury of Time, im|perfect, till within the&s;e Four&s;core Years, when &s;ome Fragments were found which compleated the Relation; this is gene|rally

<HEAD>The FEAST of TRIMALCHIO.</HEAD>
<P>GLUTTED with the public Di|ver&s;ions, of Theatres, Amphithea|tres, and Bacchanalian Revels, we vi&s;ited the mo&s;t Sacred Palaces of Monarchy, and beheld with aweful Reverence, the public Banquettings of the&s;e earthly Gods! we &s;aw the Augu&s;t Emperor at his Meals, and we did &s;ee the People gape as he did eat; I truly wondered that they &s;hould betray &s;o much of the Imperfection of human Nature, to the Multitude, who by this might di&s;cover that Kings differed not at all from common Men. The Luxury of the Nation encouraged no Entertainment which we did not partake of, our Ears
<PB N="44" REF="122">
were fea&s;ted with the mo&s;t wanton and la&s;|civious Strains of In&s;truments and Voices, and we could perceive the Pa&s;&s;ions the&s;e Airs in&s;pired in the Faces of an Hun|dred Beauties almo&s;t naked to the Wai&s;t; and now we purpo&s;ed to retire, and enjoy a Week's Interval from the Fatigues of Plea&s;ure, when a Slave came to inform us, that his Ma&s;ter, <HI>Caius Pompeius Trimal|chio</HI> invited us to a Repa&s;t, where every Man might &s;peak his mind. He is, &s;ays the Slave, a Man of infinite Humour, and a mo&s;t excellent Politician I a&s;&s;ure you. Having dre&s;t our &s;elves, we bid him conduct us to his Ma&s;ter; but in our way thither, the &s;treets were greatly thronged with Hor&s;e|men, who had been hunting and were now returning from the Chace; I was wholly taken up with the Homage that was paid to one of the Sport&s;men, and the Gran|deur of his Equipage, when <HI>Menelaus,</HI> a Nobleman and one of his Attendants, &s;teps up to us, pre&s;enting a Gentleman, &s;aying this is he with whom you are to dine.</P>
<P>He was a portly Man, &s;omewhat Gouty, and acco&s;ted every body with an affected Smile; upon our Appearance he made an offer of alighting to receive us, when the greater part of his Retinue di&s;mounted in an in&s;tant; &s;ome of them held his Bridle, others took hold of his Stirrup,
<PB N="45" REF="123">
the re&s;t bent their Backs, reclined their Heads, and threw them&s;elves into the re&s;emblance of &s;o many Hor&s;e-Blocks, &s;eeming to court his Foot to tread upon their Necks, about which they wore a chain, loo&s;e and carele&s;s, to denote the plea&s;ure they took in their Servitude. You may imagine this Submi&s;&s;ion reduced the Cavalcade to &s;ome di&s;order; for my part, I was quite aba&s;hed, having never &s;een the like, &s;o flung my &s;elf upon the Ground, a|mong&s;t the re&s;t, as did my Companions, in which we were very lucky, for I afterwards under&s;tood it was a Ceremony required of every body that were to be his Gue&s;ts. We were &s;oon rai&s;ed up, mounted on led Hor&s;es, and the Troop renewed it's former Order, marching re|gularly into a Court-Yard, where we di&s;mounted; and walking to the En|trance of the Portico read this In|&s;cription:</P>
<P>If any Slave &s;hall &s;ay <HI>AYE</HI> or <HI>NO,</HI> contrary to the Will of his Ma&s;ter, he &s;hall be &s;tript of his Livery and lo&s;e his Wages.</P>
<P>At the entrance of the Hall was a Gla&s;s Room, which I took to be the Porter's Lodge, and admired the Contrivance, but was pre&s;ently convinced of my Mi&s;take, when rai&s;ed by Pullies to the Roof, I

di&s;covered it to be a mo&s;t &s;tupendious Lanthorn.</P>
<P>We advanced to the Stair-ca&s;e, where a Market-Place was de&s;cribed, with Slaves &s;etting upon Benches to the <HI>right</HI> and <HI>left,</HI> to be BOUGHT and SOLD, <HI>Trimalchio</HI> hard by with a Whip and Bridle; a little farther was repre&s;ented how he fir&s;t learnt to &s;pell, and beyond that was <HI>Mercury</HI> hold|ing him up by the Chin and placing him on a Throne; <HI>Fortune</HI> pre&s;ented him with a <HI>Cornucopia</HI> and the <HI>three fatal Si&s;ters,</HI> &s;pun a Thread of Gold. He was in different places painted as a Judge, a General, and a Prie&s;t; the whole was excellently performed, and highly fini&s;hed: &s;urfeited with this ful&s;om Pageantry, as we proceeded, a Slave, &s;tript of his Livery, ca&s;t him&s;elf at our feet, imploring our Protection, prote&s;ting his Fault was Inad|vertency only, that being rou&s;ed from &s;leep, and a&s;ked a que&s;tion he knew nothing of, he had &s;aid NO when he &s;hould have &s;aid YES. We were &s;aluted by him in the Di|ning-Room with thanks for the Obliga|tion, which he told us was well be&s;towed, for, &s;ays he, the Wine, my Lord drinks, you &s;hall anon find to be in the di&s;po&s;al of his Servants; having viewed the Side|board, the huge Piles of ma&s;&s;y Plate, and &s;pacious Ci&s;terns, double gilt, on which
<PB N="47" REF="125">
<HI>Trimalchio</HI>'s Arms and Name were engra|ven, and it's weight markt on each peice, we all &s;eated our&s;elves, except <HI>Trimalchio,</HI> for whom the chief Place was re&s;erved. At the &s;triking up of a Band of Mu&s;ic he made his Entrance, <HI>My Friends,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I have bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;patch, but came thus &s;oon, le&s;t my Ab&s;ence &s;hould make you unea&s;y.</HI> Now the Servants entered &s;weating be|neath the ponderous Di&s;hes, which they &s;eemed hardly able to &s;upport; the fle&s;h of Bulls, Calves, Sheep, Deer, and other Qua|drupeds; all Kinds of Fi&s;h and Fowl, were &s;tewed for the Juices they contained, which, blended into one Fluid, formed a mo&s;t delicious Soup. Near, in a golden Charger were an hundred mangled Vipers, buried in their own blood; in other Di&s;hes were the Palates of <HI>Cuckows,</HI> the Rumps of <HI>Wheat-Ears,</HI> the Brains of <HI>Nightingales,</HI> Cavear of <HI>Todpoles,</HI> an <HI>Onocrotalon,</HI> the Hump of a <HI>Camel,</HI> the Probo&s;cis of an <HI>Ele|phant,</HI> and a <HI>Sow</HI>'s Paps. I knew not a &s;eventh part of this Cour&s;e; the greate&s;t &s;hare of which was &s;crambled away before it could be di&s;tinctly viewed; a Slave in the Hurry threw down a golden Di&s;h, and &s;tooping to take it up, <HI>Trimalchio</HI> gave him a &s;ound Box on the Ear, and ordered it to be &s;wept out of the Room; the Sal|vers rang, and Wine went bri&s;kly round,
<PB N="48" REF="126">
when, every body &s;aid &s;omething in prai&s;e of this Service, this Applau&s;e was followed with a &s;econd, and that indifferent con&s;i|dering the Place, the Novelty of it however drew our Attention, it was a round Table on which were placed the <HI>twelve Signs</HI> in their proper Order, upon each of which the Di&s;po&s;er had put &s;ome thing &s;uitable. Upon ARIES was a <HI>Sheep's-Head;</HI> upon TAURUS, a <HI>Chine</HI> of <HI>Beef;</HI> upon GEMINI, <HI>Lamb's-Stones</HI> and <HI>Kidneys;</HI> upon CANCER, a <HI>Ducal-Coronet;</HI> upon LEO, the <HI>African-Fruit;</HI> upon VIRGO, <HI>Sau&s;ages;</HI> upon LIBRA, a <HI>Pair of Scales,</HI> in the <HI>one</HI> a <HI>Pudding,</HI> in the <HI>other</HI> a Panegyric; upon SCORPIO, a <HI>Sprat;</HI> upon SAGITTARIUS, a <HI>Hare;</HI> upon CAPRICORN, a <HI>Lob&s;ter;</HI> upon AQUARIUS, a <HI>Goo&s;e;</HI> upon PISCES, two <HI>Mullets;</HI> and in the middle, a Plate of <HI>&s;weet Herbs.</HI> Now <HI>Trimalchio,</HI> intreated us to be merry, called for more Wine, and larger Gla&s;&s;es, the Company were highly elevated, &s;everal Cour&s;es followed too nau|&s;eous and tedious to relate.

<P>The <HI>Sun,</HI> him&s;elf, &s;urveys it not at once, but travels for the view; a <HI>Crow</HI> can|not fly over it in a Week; he buys no|thing, yet owns the whole Town, inha|bits it all, and is him&s;elf the People. A twentieth part of his Tenants don't know their Landlord; there are <HI>Thirty</HI> Degrees among&s;t his Servants; he has <HI>twenty-&s;ix</HI> Dome&s;tic-Chaplains, and <HI>three Orders</HI> of his Favourites, whom he teaches to jump over a Stick; he is him&s;elf a Lover of Peace; for when the <HI>Alemains</HI> and <HI>Gauls</HI> were at war, he &s;ent and de&s;ired to be Friends.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will wonder to &s;ee me in Print; but how could I avoid it? The Dead and the Living, my Friends and my Foes, at home and abroad, call upon me to &s;ay &s;omething; and the Reputa|tion of an Hi&s;tory, which I, and all the World value, mu&s;t have &s;uffered, had I continued &s;ilent. I have printed <HI>here,</HI> in hopes that &s;omebody afterward may venture to reprint in <HI>England,</HI> notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e two frightening Words at the Clo&s;e of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Name.</NOTE>
<PB N="2" REF="160">
Whether that happens or not, it is fit you &s;hould have a Sight of it, who I know will read it with &s;ome degree of Satisfaction, as it is mine, tho' it &s;hould have (as it really has) nothing el&s;e to recommend it. Such as it is, <HI>Extremum hoc munus morientis habeto;</HI> For that may well be the Ca&s;e, con&s;idering that within a few Months I am entring in|to my Seventieth Year; after which, even the Healthy and the Happy cannot much de|pend upon Life, and will not, if they are wi&s;e, much de&s;ire it. Whenever I go, you will lo&s;e a Friend, who loves and values you ex|tremely, if in my Circum&s;tances I can be &s;aid to be lo&s;t to any one, when dead, more than I am already whil&s;t living. I expected to have heard from you by Mr. <HI>Morice,</HI> and wondered a little that I did not; but he owns him&s;elf in a Fault, for not giving you due Notice of his Motions. It was not ami&s;s that you forbore writing to me on a Head, wherein I promis'd more than I was able to perform. Di&s;graced Men fancy &s;ometimes, that they pre&s;erve an Influence, where, when they endeavour to exert it, they &s;oon &s;ee their Mi&s;take. I did &s;o, my good Friend, and acknowledge it under my Hand. You &s;ounded the Coa&s;t and found out my Error, it &s;eems, before I was aware of it; but enough on this Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="161">
What are you doing in <HI>England</HI> to the Ho|nour of Letters? and particularly what are you doing? <HI>Ip&s;e quid audes? Quae circum|volitas agilis Thyma?</HI> Do you pur&s;ue the moral Plan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The E&s;&s;ay on Man.</NOTE> you marked out, and &s;eemed &s;ixteen Months ago &s;o intent upon? Am I to &s;ee it perfected ere I die? And are you to enjoy the Reputation of it while you live? Or do you rather chu&s;e to leave the Marks of your Friend&s;hip, like the Legacies of a Will, to be read and enjoy'd only by tho&s;e who &s;urvive you? Were I as near you as I have been, I &s;hould hope to peep into the Manu&s;cript before it was fini&s;hed. But alas! there is and will ever probably be, a great deal of Land and Sea between us. How many Books have come out of late in your Parts, which you think I &s;hould be glad to peru&s;e? Name them: the Catalogue, I believe, will not co&s;t you much Trouble. They mu&s;t be good ones indeed to challenge any Part of my Time, now I have &s;o little of it left. I, who &s;quandred whole Days heretofore, now hu&s;|band Hours, when the Gla&s;s begins to run low, and care not to mi&s;-&s;pend them on Trifles. At the End of the Lottery of Life, our la&s;t Minutes, like Tickets left in the

Wheel, ri&s;e in their Valuation. They are not of &s;o much worth, perhaps, in them|&s;elves, as tho&s;e which preceded, but we are apt to prize them more, and with Rea&s;on. I do &s;o, my dear Friend, and yet think the mo&s;t precious Minutes of my Life are well employ'd, in reading what you write. But this is a Satisfaction I cannot much hope for, and therefore mu&s;t betake my&s;elf to others, <HI>which</HI> are le&s;s entertaining. Adieu, Dear Sir, and forgive me engaging with one, whom you, I think, have reckoned among the Heroes of the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> It was nece&s;&s;ary for me either to accept of his dirty Challenge, or to have &s;uffer'd in the E&s;teem of the World by declining it. My Re&s;pects to your Mother; I &s;end a Paper for Dean <HI>Swift,</HI> if you have an Opportunity, and think it worth your while to convey it. My Country at this Di|&s;tance &s;eems to me a &s;trange Sight, I know not how it appears to you, who are in the mid&s;t of the Scene, and your&s;elf a Part of it; I wi&s;h you would tell me. You may write &s;afely to Mr. <HI>Morice,</HI> by the hone&s;t Hand that conveys this, and will return into the&s;e Parts before <HI>Chri&s;tmas;</HI> &s;ketch out a rough Draught of it, that I may be able to judge, whether a Return to it be really eligible, or whether I &s;hould not, like the Chymi&s;t in the Bottle, upon hearing Don <HI>Quevedo</HI>'s Account
<PB N="5" REF="163">
of <HI>Spain,</HI> de&s;ire to be corked up again. After all, I do and mu&s;t love my Country, with all its Faults and Blemi&s;hes; even that Part of the Con&s;titution, which wounded me un|ju&s;tly, and it&s;elf thro' my Side, &s;hall ever be dear to me. My la&s;t Wi&s;h will be like that of Father <HI>Paul, E&s;to perpetua;</HI> and when I die at a Di&s;tance from it, it will be in the &s;ame manner as <HI>Virgil</HI> de&s;cribes the expiring <HI>Peloponne&s;ian,</HI>
<Q><L>Sternitur, &amp; dulces moriens remini&s;citur Argos.</L></Q></P>
<P>Do I &s;till live in the Memory of my Friends, as they certainly do in mine? I have read a good many of your Paper Squabbles about me, and am glad to &s;ee &s;uch free Conce&s;|&s;ions on that Head, tho' made with no View of doing me a Plea&s;ure, but merely of loading another.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>This Di&s;covery does little Honour to the three Divines named in the Letter,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>As Mr.</HI> ATTERBURY, <HI>heretofore Bi&s;hop of</HI> Roche&s;ter, <HI>one of the Three, is &s;till living, he will not probably be in&s;en&s;ible of &s;o grievous an Ac|cu&s;ation; and the Public expects from him &s;uch Accounts of it, as even the Intere&s;t of his own Reputation &s;eems to require. If he is &s;ilent on this Occa&s;ion, there can be no doubt, but that the Fal&s;ification is proved; and &s;hould he not be &s;ilent, what he &s;hall &s;ay, to clear up this Matter, mu&s;t be very &s;trong, to de&s;troy the Credit of &s;uch a Te&s;timony.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Being called upon in this public Man|ner, I my&s;elf obliged to declare, that the foregoing Account, in all its Parts, as far as I am any ways concerned, is entirely
<PB N="13" REF="171">
fal&s;e and groundle&s;s; for I never &s;aw my Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s Hi&s;tory in Manu&s;cript, ei|ther before, or &s;ince the Edition of it; nor ever read a Line of it, but in Print. It was impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, that I &s;hould deal with Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> in the Manner repre|&s;ented, with whom (as far as I can recol|lect) I never exchanged one Word in all my Life; and whom I know not that I ever &s;aw, till after the Edition of that Hi|&s;tory. If therefore he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to this Purpo&s;e, in his la&s;t Moments (as I charitably hope he did not) he wronged me extremely, and died with a Lie in his Mouth.</P>
<P>This Vindication of the Truth and my|&s;elf, is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince I happen to &s;urvive the two other worthy Per&s;ons mentioned. Were they alive, they would, I doubt not, be equally able and ready to clear them&s;elves from &s;o foul an A&s;per&s;ion. As to one of them, Dr. <HI>Smallridge,</HI> the late Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> no Su&s;picion of this kind can po&s;&s;ibly re&s;t on his Memory, becau&s;e he was not any ways concerned in preparing that Hi&s;tory for the Pre&s;s; but as much a Stranger to the Contents of it, as I my&s;elf was, till it came forth in Print. I &s;peak with the more A&s;&s;urance on this Head, be|cau&s;e my great Intimacy with him, as my Contemporary, both at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t-Church,</HI> gave me all the Advantages
<PB N="14" REF="172">
requi&s;ite towards knowing the Truth of what I &s;ay: With Dr. <HI>Aldrich,</HI> the third Per&s;on accu&s;ed, I was acquainted more at a di&s;tance: However, being called upon in the Manner I am, I will add al&s;o what has come to my Knowledge, with regard to the Share He and Others had in the Publi|cation of that Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Revi&s;ing of the Manu&s;cript (writ|ten, as I have heard, not very correctly) was committed to the Care of Bi&s;hop <HI>Sprat,</HI> and Dean <HI>Aldrich,</HI> by the late Earl of <HI>Ro|che&s;ter,</HI> who him&s;elf al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted in that Re|vi&s;al, from the Beginning to the End of the Work: So that any Changes, made in it, mu&s;t have had the Con&s;ent of tho&s;e three Per&s;ons. They were Men of Probity and Truth, and incapable of con&s;piring in a De|&s;ign to impo&s;e on the Publick. I can cite nothing, that is material in this Point, from the Mouth of the <HI>Earl,</HI> with whom I rarely conver&s;ed; but the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and the <HI>Dean,</HI> to whom I &s;everally &s;ucceeded in the Deaneries of <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> and <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> and in the See of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> have occa&s;ionally more than once a&s;&s;ured me, that no Additions what&s;oever were made to the Manu&s;cript Hi&s;tory: And even the <HI>Earl,</HI> in his Preface to the fir&s;t Volume (for His I take it to be, tho' no Name is af|fixed to it) has publickly prote&s;ted his In|nocence

<P>&mdash;THE Book<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs &amp; Reflexions, <HI>Sur les principaux Evenemens du Regne de</HI> Louis XIV.</NOTE> I now re&s;tore you, gave me Plea&s;ure when I read it. The Turn is Natural and Familiar, and there is an Air of Truth in all he &s;ays; but, I think, not the Hand of a Ma&s;ter. He tells his Tale, not like a Man who knows any thing of the Rules of Writing well, but as an ea&s;y Companion at a Table. I &s;ay of his Style, what he &s;ays of his Fi|gure, <HI>Ma figure, qui n' &ecirc;toit pas d&eacute;plai&s;ante, quoique je ne fu&s;&s;e pas du premier Ordre des Gens bien faits....</HI> i.e. My Figure, which did not di&s;plea&s;e, tho' I could not be ranked among hand&s;ome People of the fir&s;t Cla&s;s.

of good Writers, he is yet agreeable.... I cannot po&s;&s;ibly dige&s;t his taking Notice, p. 145. of the <HI>Chevalier de Rohan</HI>'s fine Legs. An Ob&s;ervation, that I &s;hould have expe|cted rather from the Pen of a fine Lady, and which &s;hews that the <HI>Marquis</HI> was in his Nature a little too intent on &s;uch Trifles. He is &s;en&s;ible of it, and excu&s;es him&s;elf in the Words which follow; but that Excu&s;e &s;erves only to &s;hew the Strength of the Im|pre&s;&s;ion he was under in this re&s;pect, &s;ince he had Judgment enough to &s;ee the Fault, and commits it notwith&s;tanding ...... Though I &s;ee he is manife&s;tly piqu'd again&s;t <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and his Mini&s;ter <HI>Louvois,</HI> yet I am apt to believe him in all he &s;ays of both of them. His Re&s;entment &s;eems to carry him no farther than to give him the Privilege of &s;peaking what he knew to be true; and, as the World goes, he that al|lows him&s;elf to cen&s;ure the Great even thus far, mu&s;t &s;ay a great deal of Ill of them... <HI>Of &s;everal</HI> French <HI>Poets he &s;peaks thus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rou&s;&s;eau</HI> appears to me &s;till a greater Poet, the more I con&s;ider him. His Talents are unconfined, and enable him in every &s;ort of writing to which he turns him&s;elf equally to excel. But the old hard Words he makes u&s;e of puzzle me often (who care not to con&s;ult a Dictionary) and chiefly in his Allegories.... <HI>Chaulieu, La Fare</HI> and
<PB N="24" REF="182">
<HI>Chapelle,</HI> have many Graces of the ea&s;y and natural Style, but I do not think them &s;o perfect in their way as <HI>Rou&s;&s;eau</HI> is in his; nor (to tell you the Truth) do I take &s;uch Plea|&s;ure in reading them. The Letters particu|larly of <HI>Chaulieu,</HI> &amp;c. are not Ma&s;ter-pieces in their kind, and many of his little Copies of Ver&s;es have nothing extraordinary in them. The Copy which touched me mo&s;t is the Ode on <HI>Fontenay.</HI>
<Q><L>Mu&s;es qui dans ce lieu champetre, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>I cannot but ob&s;erve, that under all <HI>Chaulieu</HI>'s &s;eeming Gaiety, there is an Air of Melancholy which breaks out by Fits, and &s;hews he was not at Ea&s;e in his own Mind. He endeavours to conceal it, and acts the Brave; but his Readers, with a little Pe|netration, may &s;ee through the Di&s;gui&s;e. The Fears of Death haunt him perpetually, and appear even in tho&s;e Places, where he &s;ays, he is not afraid of it. I &s;hould be glad to know how he died, whether with the &s;ame Courage he commends in Lady <HI>Mazarine.</HI> I &s;hould gue&s;s not, by the Ob&s;ervations I have made of him.</P>
<P>After peru&s;ing a Di&s;&s;ertation of Mr. <HI>de Boze,</HI> the Bi&s;hop makes the following Remark.</P>
<P>This Book, I find, was written two and thirty Years ago, and therefore it is no wonder
<PB N="25" REF="183">
that it &s;hould not be equal to the later Per|formances of the &s;ame Author. One may &s;ay of it as <HI>Tully</HI> &s;peaks of his Collection of Pa|radoxes; <HI>Non tale e&s;t hoc opus ut in arte poni po&s;&s;it, qua&s;i illa Minerva Phidiae; &s;ed tamen, ut ex e&acirc;dem officin&acirc; exi&s;&s;e appareat.</HI> Though it be not of the &s;ame Value with his other Works, yet it is &s;uch, as that one may per|ceive the &s;ame Workman's Hand and Skill in it. He cho&s;e a little contracted Subject; and had not Room therefore to &s;hew his Talents at full length in managing it. And yet, narrow and dry as his Subject is, he has, by making &s;everal little Digre&s;&s;ions, and by taking Occa&s;ion to &s;ay many things which were not nece&s;&s;ary to his Point, rendered it, not only in&s;tructive but entertaining.
<Q><L>In tenui labor, at tenuis non gloria, &s;i quem</L>
<L>Numina laeva &s;inunt, auditque vocatus Apollo.</L></Q>
Whether his forth <HI>Gordean</HI> be a Reality or a Phantom; whether he owes his very being to this Gentleman, or is only re&s;cued from Oblivion, and brought again to Life by him, let the Antiquaries determine: I am &s;o ea&s;y and indolent as not to think it of much Moment, which Way &s;uch Facts are &s;ettled; nor &s;hould I have thought what is written on this Point worth read|ing, if this Author had not writ it. In all
<PB N="26" REF="184">
he writes, one &s;ees the &s;ame Candor and Impartiality; the &s;ame Learning, good Sen&s;e and Exactne&s;s. If the Argument he handles be not of Importance, he makes it &s;o by his manner of handling it. So that I could wi&s;h, in&s;tead of four Books, he had written forty: as old as I am, and as many other things as I have to do, I &s;hould read all of them.... I have perus'd <HI>(&s;ays the Bi&s;hop in another Letter)</HI> the Book about <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the Work intitled, <HI>Reflexions critiques &s;ur la Poe&s;ie &amp; la Peinture,</HI> by <HI>Abb&eacute; du Bos.</HI> A new Edition of it, with Corrections and Additions, has been publi&s;hed by the Author, &s;ince the writing of this Letter.</NOTE> Poetry and Painting, with Attention.

The Author &s;eems to have gone too deep in that &s;ort of Refle|ctions, and &s;ometimes not to have gone deep enough in others, which relate more immediately and naturally to his Subject. Forgive this Freedom, but it
<PB N="27" REF="185">
is my real &s;en&s;e of the Matter. Be&s;ides, there is, I think, a want of Method in the whole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author has changed the Order and Di&s;po&s;ition of his Work, in the la&s;t Edition of it.</NOTE>; and the 19th Section, which is &s;o long, is to me a little ob&s;cure. The many learned Citations there, do not clear, but cloud the Author's Meaning, I am apt to imagine that in the mu&s;ical Part of it, he &s;peaks of what he does not him&s;elf tho|roughly under&s;tand; for if he does, he would probably have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o, that his Reader al&s;o would have under&s;tood it, which, (as to me at lea&s;t) is not the Ca&s;e. In one thing I differ from him e&s;|&s;entially; my fixed Opinion is, that the Re|putation of all Books which are perfectly well writ, comes Originally from the Few, and not from the Many; and I think I could &s;ay a good deal in Defence of that Opinion......

<P>The following Remarks are made upon Mr. <HI>Fontenelle</HI>'s Manner of Writing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I return you, Sir, the two Eloges, which I have peru&s;ed with Plea&s;ure. I borrow that Word from your Language, becau&s;e we have none in our own that exactly expre&s;&s;es it. By the Account I had of tho&s;e Pieces, I imagined them very different from what I find them. Mr. <HI>Fontenelle</HI>'s Talents, as to the Knowledge of Nature, Mathematicks, and the <HI>Belles Lettres,</HI> are &s;ufficiently under|&s;tood.
<PB N="29" REF="187">
But I take notice particularly of the Art and Addre&s;s with which he con|ducts him&s;elf in nice Points, and the pru|dent and political Views by which his Pen is guided; a Quality, that does not often belong to Men who have &s;pent &s;o much of their time in &s;tudying the Arts and Sciences. He has been mi&s;informed as to one little Particular, in the &s;hort Draught he has given us of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Figure. The <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The very lively and piercing Eye.</NOTE><HI>oeil fort vif, &amp; fort per&ccedil;ant,</HI> which he gives him, did not belong to him, at lea&s;t not for twenty Years pa&s;t, about which time I fir&s;t came acquainted with him. In|deed, in the whole Air of his Face and make, there was nothing of that penetra|ting Sagacity which appears in his Compo|&s;ures. He had &s;omething rather languid in his Look and Manner, which did not rai&s;e any great Expectation in tho&s;e who did not know him. I &s;ee Mr. <HI>Fontenelle</HI> &s;peaks wa|rily as to the MSS. relating to Antiquity, Hi&s;tory and Divinity, which Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> left behind him: I wi&s;h, for the Honour of our Country, that they may be as excellent in their Kind as tho&s;e he publi&s;hed. But I fear the Ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e, and that he will be found to have been a great Ma&s;ter only
<PB N="30" REF="188">
in that one way to which he was by Na|ture inclined. It is enough for us poor limited Creatures, if we remarkably excel in any one Branch of Knowledge. We may have a Smattering of more; but it is beyond the Lot of our Nature, to attain any Perfection in them. Mr. <HI>Fontenelle</HI>'s Prai&s;e of Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Mode&s;ty (and of Mo|de&s;ty in general) is to me the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Part of that De&s;cription he has given us of him. It is that Mode&s;ty which will teach us to &s;peak, and think of the Antients with Reverence, e&s;pecially if we happen not to be thoroughly acquainted with them. Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> certainly was, and his great Veneration for them was one di&s;tingui&s;hing Part of his Character, which I wonder (or rather, I do not wonder) that Mr. <HI>Fontenelle</HI> has omitted. His Opinion of them was, that they were Men of great Genius and &s;uperior Minds, who had carried their Di&s;coveries (particularly in A&s;tronomy and other Parts of Mathematicks) much farther than now appears from what remains of their Wri|tings. One may apply to them, what was &s;aid by an old learned Man, to one of le&s;s Knowledge and fewer Years, who in&s;ulted him, <HI>I have forgot more Knowledge than ever you had.</HI> More of the Antients is lo&s;t, than is pre&s;erved, and perhaps our new Di&s;co|veries are not equal to tho&s;e old Lo&s;&s;es.&mdash;

But this was not what I had in my Thoughts, when I &s;at down to write: my Intention was only to expre&s;s the Satisfa|ction I had in the Peru&s;al of what I re|turn, of which I could &s;ay more, if the End of the Page did not admoni&s;h me to tell you how much I am &amp;c.</P>

I could wi&s;h only that the Writer had been a greater Ma&s;ter of his Subject, &s;o as to have given us di|&s;tincter and fuller Accounts of it, which would have left no Doubts upon the Minds of his Readers. I am &s;atisfied that a Pen like his would have been able to expre&s;s the mo&s;t nice and difficult Points of which he treats in a Way equally in&s;tructive and plea&s;ing, and have opened to us in Dialogue the My&s;teries of Mu&s;ic, as ea&s;ily and fami|liarly as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fontenelle</HI> has done tho&s;e of A&s;tronomy.

<P>Let me ask you for my own Information, whether <HI>tourner de tous les &s;ens,</HI> be a proper Phra&s;e in that Ca&s;e. To me it &s;eems to &s;poil the Metaphor. He cites &s;ome Au|thorities, which I am at a Lo&s;s to explain; particularly p. 58. that of <HI>Varro de Repub. Rom. L.</HI> 1. <HI>C.</HI> 1. Sure he does not mean the antient <HI>Varro,</HI> who wrote nothing that I know of, under that Title. He is beholden, I find, to the long Chapter of <HI>Abb&eacute; du Bois,</HI> where the antient Authorities, relating to his Subject, are collected; and he has
<PB N="34" REF="192">
made a free U&s;e of them. But my Inten|tion was, to tell you rather what plea&s;ed me in the Book, than what I di&s;liked.</P>
<P>From what I have read (in the&s;e Books) and other Pieces, &s;ince I came on this &s;ide of the Water, I have conceived a much greater Opinion of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> than I had while in <HI>England,</HI> and give him readily the Preference to all tho&s;e Writers of the Church of <HI>France</HI> which I am acquainted with. He is an univer&s;al Genius, and manages every thing he takes in Hand, like a Ma&s;ter. Good Sen&s;e, and &s;ound Reflections attend all he &s;ays; which is expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t agreeable and beautiful Manner, without any of the Pomp or Paint of fal&s;e Oratory. He has particularly the Secret of knowing, not only what to &s;ay, but what not to &s;ay; the harde&s;t Ta&s;k even of the mo&s;t exact and excellent Writers! ... But you know him, Sir, better than I; and I &s;hould be to blame therefore in attempting any Part of his Character, did not Gratitude forbid me to return your Books, without giving you an Account of the Plea&s;ure I had in peru&s;ing them. Even the Lady's Memoirs relating to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince&s;s, gave me a good deal; particularly that Part of them, where the Story of her Death is told, in as natural and affecting a Manner,
<PB N="35" REF="193">
I think, as is po&s;&s;ible. It has &s;uch a me|lancholy Air of Truth in it, as, at the &s;ame Time that it gives Conviction, moves Com|pa&s;&s;ion; and one can no more read it, than one could have been pre&s;ent at the &s;ad Scene of it, without Tears. I really pre|fer the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI>'s Funeral Oration, to tho&s;e of <HI>Flechier</HI> or <HI>Bourdalo&uuml;e;</HI> tho' I think he would have wrote &s;till better, had he imitated them le&s;s; for, by that means, he now and then heightens his Expre&s;&s;ion a little too much, and becomes unnatural. I gave you one In&s;tance of that when I &s;aw you la&s;t.</P>
<P>The more I read of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> the more I value him, as a great and able Writer, and particularly for that Talent of taking as many Advantages of an Adver|&s;ary, and giving him as few as any Man, I believe, that ever entered the Li&s;ts of Con|trover&s;y. There is a &s;erious Warmth in all he &s;ays, and his manner of &s;aying it, is noble and moving; and yet I que&s;tion, after all, whether he &s;ometimes is in good Earne&s;t. Pardon that Freedom, Sir, I have read him with Attention, and watch|ed him narrowly. I have read all the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI>'s <HI>Pieces</HI> that have been procured for me: and will wait for the re&s;t, till I can have them from your Hands. In the mean time, I will read
<PB N="36" REF="194">
wor&s;e Books, that I may reli&s;h his the more, when I return to them; tho', to &s;peak the Truth, I know no Writer in your Tongue, that has le&s;s need to have his Reader &s;o prepared for him. Do you hear nothing from your Friend <HI>Voltaire?</HI> Is <HI>England</HI> as well plea&s;ed with him, as it was? And is he as well plea&s;ed with <HI>Eng|land?</HI> Or, does the Satisfaction on one &s;ide abate, in Proportion as it le&s;&s;ens on the other? When will the &s;econd Edition of his <HI>Henriade</HI> come out? Will it afford us a better Monument to the Memory of that Prince, and a nobler Likene&s;s, than the Statue on <HI>Pont-neuf?</HI> It will, if it be as well fini&s;hed as it &s;hould be. For<Q><L>Non magis expre&s;&s;i vultus per ahenea &s;igna,</L>
<L>Qu&agrave;m per vatis opus mores animique virorum</L>
<L>Clarorum apparent.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the Spirit of Pedantry is coming upon me, and it is time therefore that I tell you, I am &amp;c.</P>
<P>I find the very la&s;t Works of that great Man, <HI>the Bi&s;hop of</HI> Meaux are inferior to the re&s;t; but, neverthele&s;s, I would be Ma&s;ter of all he certainly wrote. It is u&s;eful to ob&s;erve even the Defects of Fir&s;t-rate Writers, as well as their Excel|lencies. There is an ill-natured Plea&s;ure in
<PB N="37" REF="195">
finding, that, as far exalted above us as they are, they &s;ometimes &s;ink down to our Level. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> &s;tudied Critical Knowledge late, with re&s;pect to the Inter|pretation of Scripture; and was never therefore &s;o true a Ma&s;ter of it, as he was of the Way of interpreting it by the Stream of Tradition. But the older he grew, the more admired he was; and that led him to think him&s;elf equal to every Man, in eve|ry thing; and particularly to write Books in <HI>Latin,</HI> and Comments on Scripture, in both which ways I find him unequal to him&s;elf; and I dare &s;ay, that is the Opi|nion of candid and judicious Per&s;ons in your Communion.</P>
<P>Our Friend, Father <HI>Courayer,</HI> has been pur&s;ued with Mandements, Cen&s;ures and Arr&ecirc;ts; nor have they, I fear, yet done with him. I am concerned for the Fate of &s;o valuable a Man, and &s;o excellent a Writer, who&s;e Views, I am per&s;ua|ded, were innocent and good, however in the Manner of executing them, he comes to have given &s;o much Offence. The twenty Bi&s;hops that have cen&s;ured him, &s;eem to decline that Part of the Di&s;|pute which relates to the Validity of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ordinations. However, they have not &s;pared the Church of <HI>England,</HI> on other Accounts, but have repre&s;ented her
<PB N="38" REF="196">
in a more di&s;advantageous Light than &s;he de&s;erves; purely, I &s;uppo&s;e, for want of knowing her. They cite the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> and cite tho&s;e Works of his, which were written expre&s;ly again&s;t us; which &s;urely is a very odd Way of repre&s;enting our Sentiments; ju&s;t as if I &s;hould quote Mon&s;ieur <HI>Claude</HI>'s Words, from any Pieces of his written again&s;t the Church of <HI>France,</HI> to prove what &s;he held in any Doctrine of Importance. I &s;hould think it became me rather to produce the Writers of that Church, and the Acts and Monuments of it, for my Vouchers. The twenty Bi&s;hops have taken this Method, once or twice; and if they had taken it always, they would have been le&s;s liable to Mi&s;takes in their Re|pre&s;entations of us. What the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> &s;ays, with regard to our Polity and Affairs, is not always to be rely'd on; for he was not a Ma&s;ter of that Subject. He was a very great Man; nor would he have le&s;&s;ened his Character, not to have aimed &s;ometimes at &s;eeming to know, what he really did not, in Matters that lay a little out of his Compa&s;s. Excu&s;e the Freedom I take with the Cen&s;urers, and the Autho|rity on which they build, in relation to our Matters; becau&s;e I have good Rea&s;on to think, that they have paid a Deference to it, at the Expence of Truth. My Know|ledge
<PB N="39" REF="197">
is very limited; and yet it would be no Pre&s;umption in me to &s;ay, that I know better than the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> did, what is the Con&s;titution, and what are the Prin|ciples and Tenets of the Church of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> But enough of the&s;e Reflections, into which the Mention of Father <HI>Courayer</HI> has led me.</P>

<HEAD>TO His Excellency the Right Honourable THOMAS Lord PARKER, Lord High Chancellor of GREAT-BRITAIN, one of his Maje&s;ty's Lords Ju&s;tices. LONDON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Henley, near Ludlow, <DATE>Aug. 4. 1719.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Taking <HI>London</HI> in my Way between <HI>Lewes</HI> and <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> came to your Lord&s;hip's Hou&s;e the Morning before I went to <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> but your Lord&s;hip was then &s;itting. I did then intend to have in|formed your Lord&s;hip of what occurred in the Circuit thitherto, relating to the Pub|lick, e&s;pecially in <HI>Kent:</HI> and after I came from <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> I found your Lord&s;hip was gone out of Town; and before your Re|turn I &s;et out for my Country-concerns here in <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> 'till near next Term; &s;o that what Account I give your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t be by Letter.</P>
<P>Tho' your Lord&s;hip has heard how the Verdict went in the Tryal at <HI>Ro|che&s;ter,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Occa&s;ioned by a Charity-Sermon preached there, by one <HI>Hendley</HI> of <HI>I&s;tington.</HI> He died not long after.</NOTE>
<PB N="55" REF="213">
 yet perhaps it may not be unaccept|able to your Lord&s;hip, to have &s;ome Ab&s;tract of the Matter ari&s;ing in it. I began at &s;ix in the Morning, by my Appointment, and held till twelve. The Court was very full of Clergymen, and a great Auditory; and I gave both Sides Liberty to expatiate as they plea&s;ed, e&s;pecially the Defendants, that they might not &s;ay but that they had a full and fair Tryal. Mo&s;t of the Witne&s;|&s;es for the Pro&s;ecution were unwilling, and did prove the Facts but meanly; but af|terwards the Witne&s;&s;es for the Defendants did, upon que&s;tioning, prove all the Facts very fully upon all the Defendants, viz. <HI>Hendley</HI> the Preacher, the School-ma&s;ter and the two Collectors, being all who were &s;erved with Proce&s;s. Serjeant <HI>Comins,</HI> Sir <HI>Con&s;t. Phipps</HI> and Mr. <HI>Blunden,</HI> Defendants, after an Harangue upon the Vertue of Cha|rity, and how e&s;&s;ential to Chri&s;tianity (tho' I thought the Texts they cited proved ano|ther &s;ort of Charity, viz. Good-Nature and Good-Neighbourhood, but I thought it not proper then to take Notice of the Di&s;tinction) they in&s;i&s;ted chiefly,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it would di&s;courage all Chari|ty, and Charity-Schools, which would thus be in Danger of Subver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="56" REF="214">
2. That every Par&s;on might order Col|lections, in his own Pari&s;h, for what Cha|rities he plea&s;e, e&s;pecially if approved of by the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Rubrick in the Communion Service, a Common-Prayer Book being pro|duced in Court, does imply that the Par|&s;on and the Bi&s;hop are intru&s;ted in Col|lections of Charity in the Church; for it &s;ays, that if the Par&s;on and Church-war|dens di&s;agree in the Di&s;tribution, the Bi&s;hop &s;hall determine.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Par&s;on of the Pari&s;h, and al&s;o the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> did give <HI>Hendley</HI> Leave to preach this Sermon, for this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5. That tho' the Sermon was done, yet the Prayer for the holy Catholic Church at the Communion Table was not quite fini&s;h|ed, as were not al&s;o the Sentences for ex|citing Charity, when Mr. <HI>Farrington,</HI> the Ju&s;tice of Peace, interrupted the Colle|ction.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the two pre&s;ent Archbi&s;hops have preached Charity-Sermons, in <HI>London,</HI> for the Children of other Pari&s;hes there.</P>
<P N="7">7. That there is no Precedent of &s;uch an Indictment ever before.</P>
<P>Too much Time was &s;pent on both Sides, relating to what Power the Bi&s;hops had antiently in the Di&s;tribution even of
<PB N="57" REF="215">
Tythes and Profits relating to the Church, and their Rights to licence Preaching, and to direct what is to be done in Churches, and that Laymen are not to intermeddle there.</P>
<P>Serjeant <HI>Darnel,</HI> Mr. <HI>Baines</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mar&s;h</HI> were <HI>pro Rege.</HI> The Sub&s;tance of what they all &s;aid is herein mentioned, in|termixed with my own Thoughts in my &s;umming up to the Jury.</P>
<P>I fir&s;t &s;aid, that there were three Things much in&s;i&s;ted on by the Defendants Coun|&s;el, and an&s;wered by the Coun&s;el on the other Side, which I thought ought to be pared off and put out of the Ca&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. All Jealou&s;y of di&s;couraging all Cha|rity and Charity-Schools; for that they re|mained ju&s;t as they were before, as long as they kept within the Bounds of their pro|per Pari&s;hes. But tho' this Ca&s;e was quite of a different Nature, relating to arbitrary Collections, and that in other Pari&s;hes, and the coming of fifty Boys and Girls toge|ther begging for that Purpo&s;e; and if this was practi&s;ed, it might do more Harm to Charity-Schools, by making them odious to their Pari&s;hes, who&s;e Poor would be in|jured, by le&s;&s;ening the Charity to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. It ought to be put out of the Ca&s;e, whether Mr. <HI>Hendley</HI> was authorized to preach there, or not; for that I thought
<PB N="58" REF="216">
it the &s;ame Ca&s;e if the Par&s;on of the Pa|ri&s;h him&s;elf had then preached, [It was at my Tongue's End, <HI>if the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf had preached,</HI> as indeed it was the &s;ame; but I thought it better not to heat the Que&s;tion by a Suppo&s;al of the Bi&s;hop's preaching] for that the Preaching was not the Point, being u&s;ed only to excite giving; but the true Point was, whether the Collection was without lawful Authority; and therefore the Collecting of it in the Church is not a Jot better, in Point of Law, than if the fifty Boys and Girls had &s;tood at the Mar|ket-place, and the Collectors had there re|ceived the Charity of whom they could a&s;&s;emble about them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another Matter I thought proper to be pared off (tho' &s;o much debated on both Sides) whether it was a Crime (I &s;uppo&s;e the Crime &s;ugge&s;ted in the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ro|che&s;ter</HI>'s Court) to interrupt the Collection before the Prayer for the holy Catholic Church, and the Sentences for Charity, were fully read, &s;ince they thought, that if &s;uch Collecting is an unlawful Act, the proper Time to &s;top it is ju&s;t when it be|gins, or &s;oon after, as here was done by Mr. <HI>Farrington;</HI> for otherwi&s;e Common-Prayer, or a Sermon might be u&s;ed to ju|&s;tify and give a Sanction to any unlawful Act, and this Stop might as well have
<PB N="59" REF="217">
been in the Middle of the Common-Prayer, or of the Sermon, in ca&s;e the unlawful Collection had then begun: &s;o that the true Point is, whether the Collection was unlawful; and upon that all the Ca&s;e de|pends.</P>
<P>As for the A&s;&s;ertion, that every Par&s;on of a Pari&s;h may order Collections, in his Pari&s;h for Charities, when and for what he plea&s;es; I declared my Opinion, that he could not; it not being any Part of his Function, like reading Prayers, Preaching, Chri&s;tening, Burying, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd I knew not how he was made Judge of the Times and Objects of all Charities within his Pari&s;h, tho' he might preach as much as he plea&s;ed upon the general Duty of Charity.</P>
<P>As to the Rubrick in the Communion Service, I &s;aid, I thought that was to be taken <HI>&s;ecundum &s;ubjectam materiam,</HI> viz. the ordinary Collection at the Communion, which is ever then u&s;ed to be made for the Poor of that Pari&s;h, but &s;hould not extend to every Collection the Par&s;on &s;hould ap|point for any foreign Charity, and that I did not till now hear that the Clergy did claim &s;uch a Power. And farther I &s;aid, that I thought tho&s;e Words of the Rubrick did not imply &s;uch a Power in the Par&s;on; for the Words being [the Money given at the Offering &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed of to &s;uch
<PB N="60" REF="218">
pious and charitable U&s;es as the Par&s;on and the Church-wardens &s;hall think fit, where|in if they di&s;agree, it &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed of as the Ordinary &s;hall appoint.] Such a Power of appointing a Collection at Plea|&s;ure is as much implied in the Church-wardens as in the Par&s;on, for they have as much Liberty to di&s;agree from the Par|&s;on in the Di&s;tribution, as the Par&s;on has to di&s;agree from them; and &s;o the Church-wardens might al&s;o appoint Collections for what Charities they plea&s;ed: but that I thought that the Par&s;on and Church-wardens, either jointly or &s;everally, could not appoint any Collection for Charity otherwi&s;e than in common Form for the Poor of their own Pari&s;h, and that tho&s;e are the charitable U&s;es intended by the Ru|brick, and particularly at the Communion, to the Service of which tho&s;e Words of the Rubrick are &s;ubjoined. [I hope your Lord&s;hip, on reading that Part of the Ru|brick at the End of the Communion Ser|vice will be of my Opinion, which I then &s;uddenly declared, as to the Implication, and do not &s;ince alter, unle&s;s otherwi&s;e convinced.]</P>
<P>As to what was mentioned of the two pre&s;ent Archbi&s;hops, it was for the Poor of the &s;ame Town, tho' of a different Pa|ri&s;h: and all the Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e
<PB N="61" REF="219">
Ca&s;es do not now appear, nor were they litigated, as this Ca&s;e is.</P>
<P>As to the Objection, that there is no Precedent of &s;uch an Indictment ever before.</P>
<P>Sol.&mdash;There never was &s;uch an At|tempt before, that fifty Boys and Girls &s;hould go into another Pari&s;h, in another County, and make a kind of Migration in &s;uch a Body, really begging, tho' with great Formality. And tho' much might be &s;aid (as the Coun&s;el for the King in|&s;i&s;ted) to bring them within the Statute of Vagrants, e&s;pecially &s;eeing the Stat. of 39. <HI>Eliz.</HI> C. 4. Paragr. 2. &s;ays, That all Per&s;ons calling them&s;elves Scholars, going about begging, &s;hall be accounted Va|grants: yet I judged it not proper to put the Ca&s;e upon that Point, when I thought it &s;o clear otherways, and fit &s;o to be men|tioned.</P>
<P>I al&s;o told the Jury, that this Ca&s;e did con&s;i&s;t of two Parts: the fir&s;t but parti|cular, and the other very general.</P>
<P>As to the particular, it is relating to the Maintenance of the Poor, which is not of a Spiritual Nature, but a mere Lay-Con|cern, and relating to the Civil Govern|ment; and the &s;everal Acts of Parliament do plainly e&s;teem it as &s;uch, by ordering the Rates and Collections for the Poor, and
<PB N="62" REF="220">
putting the whole Managment into the Lay Hands of the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and the Over-&s;eers of the Poor, who are to be nominated by the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and accountable to them, and by their Directions to &s;et the Poor at Work, if they thought proper; and therefore a Ju&s;tice of Peace, being then in the Church, might well take it to be a Matter within his Juri&s;diction, and that he might &s;top &s;uch a new and extraordinary Proceeding, newly begun among the Clergy, relating to the Maintenance of the Poor, and a Col|lection made by Strangers, without the Con&s;ent or A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Church-war|dens or Over-&s;eers of the Poor of that Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>But this Ca&s;e, if under a general Con|&s;ideration, is of a va&s;t Extent, and mighty Con&s;equence to the King and the People, and at which the very Legi&s;lature may take great Umbrage. The levying of Mo|ney is the tendere&s;t Part of our Con&s;titu|tion, and if it may be done arbitrarily, under the Shew and Form of Charity, (which may comprize all good Works and all good Intentions) it cannot be &s;aid whi|ther it may go, any more than it can be &s;aid whither the&s;e fifty Boys and Girls may go: for as, by the &s;ame Rea&s;on, they may go into all the Pari&s;hes in <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="221">
&s;o Collections, as for Charities, may be &s;et up in all the Churches in <HI>England</HI> by the Clergy, as often as they plea&s;e: and tho' it be &s;aid, it is all but Voluntary giving, yet it is a &s;ort of Compul&s;ion, by the Solemni|ty in the Church, and vying with others, and being marked out, if refu&s;ing, or giving meanly.</P>
<P>In the Time of <HI>Charles</HI> I. the Parlia|ment took great Offence at &s;ome Attempts for free Gifts to the Crown; and we hear that Cardinal <HI>Alberoni</HI> is now &s;etting up the like all over <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>But be&s;ides, here in <HI>England</HI> no Collection, even for Charity (unle&s;s for the Poor of the &s;ame Pari&s;h) is, by Law, to be made, but by the Leave and Permi&s;&s;ion of the King, gathering of Money being &s;o nice a Mat|ter, that it mu&s;t not be done, even for Cha|rity, without his Leave, in the mo&s;t com|pa&s;&s;ionate Ca&s;es; and thence the antient Method of Briefs, under the Great Seal, has been u&s;ed, even upon extreme great Lo&s;&s;es by Fire. And the Stat. of 4 and 5 of <HI>Anne,</HI> have put the whole Manage|ment of Briefs under the Regulation of the Court of Chancery, and impower the lay|ing great Fines upon the Offenders. But this Method were giving a Go-by to all Royal Licences, and putting it in the Pow|er of the Clergy to do all Acts of Charity of
<PB N="64" REF="222">
them&s;elves at the Expence of the People, and to be &s;ole Judges of the Occa&s;ions, and to make what Application and Ac|count they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I told the Jury, that I was very clear of Opinion, in Point of Law, this was a Ca&s;e of dangerous Con&s;equence, and was an Inva&s;ion not only on the King's Pre|rogative, but al&s;o upon the Legi&s;lature, and that I thought the Defendants Guilty.</P>
<P>The Jury &s;tayed out but a little while and brought them in all Guilty. I then told the Defendants Coun&s;el, that if they did not like my Opinion, in Point of Law, they might bring their Writ of Er|ror; and the Indictment being &s;o &s;pecial, it did equal a &s;pecial Verdict, and they might have the Opinion of a &s;pecial Court, if they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>I then &s;et a Fine of a Noble upon each Defendant, I &s;aying, it was &s;o &s;mall only becau&s;e it was made a Que&s;tion; but now that a Verdict had &s;ettled it, there would be very heavy Fines upon tho&s;e who &s;hould pre&s;ume to offend in like Manner hereafter. Yet I heard that &s;ome Gentlemen in the Town had thereupon &s;aid, that I had been too favourable to them by &s;o &s;mall Fines: but it was far from my Intention of any Favour to them, but of Service to the King; whereas, if great, it might have been &s;aid,
<PB N="65" REF="223">
that, while they were pro&s;ecuted for levy|ing Money on the People, the Pro&s;ecution was only to levy Money upon them, when it was really to &s;ettle the Point: and great Fines might have rai&s;ed Compa&s;&s;ion, and perhaps a Collection for them. It would be great Satisfaction to me if your Lord|&s;hip be of the &s;ame Opinion with me, as to the Smallne&s;s of the Fines; I am &s;ure I intended it for the be&s;t.</P>
<P>I gave Mr. <HI>Woodford</HI> a News-Paper, wherein was an Adverti&s;ement, which I thought very fit to be &s;hewed to Superiors: that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> had i&s;&s;ued a Cir|cular Letter, to all his Clergy, to collect Charities in their Pari&s;hes for the poor Vi|carages in <HI>England,</HI> which I thought much of a Kin to the late Collection in <HI>Kent,</HI> or rather more dangerous, not only by rai&s;ing a va&s;t Sum of Money (if the like in all Dioce&s;es) but al&s;o by marking out People how far affected to the Church throughout <HI>England,</HI> and ca&s;ting &s;ome Reflection upon Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Bounty, and upon a benefi|cial Explanation after by his pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty, yet as if to be &s;upported by begging: and this done in a Time of Taxes, which mu&s;t appear the more heavy after &s;uch Collections; and the Clergy would thus gain a Power of rai&s;ing Money as they plea&s;e, and applying it as they plea&s;e. How
<PB N="66" REF="224">
this Project goes on I know not; but &s;ure it ought to be &s;topped: and for that Pur|po&s;e, a Thing very appo&s;ite was mentioned in the Debate of the late Tryal in <HI>Kent,</HI> That commonly about <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> when it is hard with the Poor for want of Work, in great Fro&s;t and Snow, then the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> does &s;end a Circular Letter, to the Pari&s;hes within the Bills of Mortality, to make Collections for the Poor, to be put into the Hands of the Lord Mayor. But it was al&s;o alledged in the &s;ame Tryal, that, pre-cedent to &s;uch Circular Letter, of that Bi&s;hop, the King &s;ends a Letter, un|der his Sign Manual, to that Bi&s;hop, au|thorizing and requiring him &s;o to do. This de&s;erves to be inquired into, and, if true, it is a Ca&s;e in Point again&s;t this new Letter of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> if without the King's Licence.</P>
<P>A Man of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> worth nothing, was convicted before me of drinking the Pretender's Health. I ordered him to be whipped, in open Market, twice, till his Back was bloody, with a Month between the fir&s;t and &s;econd Whipping.</P>
<P>And at <HI>Lewes,</HI> a Man of <HI>Rye</HI> was con|victed before me for drinking the Health of King <HI>James</HI> the Third, and &s;aying, he knew no &s;uch Per&s;on as King <HI>George.</HI> He had run out a good E&s;tate by Loo&s;ene&s;s, and
<PB N="67" REF="225">
had nothing left but an Annuity of thirty Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> for his Life. I fined him a hundred Pounds, and committed him till paid, and that he &s;hould find good Sureties for his good Behaviour for three Years next after the Payment of the Fine. I told him, that by his paying a hundred Pounds to King <HI>George,</HI> he would certainly know there is &s;uch a Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip's Notion, again&s;t &s;etting a State Offender in the Pillory, was certainly very right, and did &s;o convince me, that I have ever &s;ince ordered corporal or pecuniary Puni&s;hments upon them, as having a better Effect upon &s;hamele&s;s People, and without giving the Mob an Opportunity to be trou|ble&s;ome.</P>
<P>I declared in all my Charges in this Circuit, as I did the two la&s;t Terms at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> that the Number of ba&s;e Libels, and &s;edi|tious Papers, is intolerable, and that now a quicker Cour&s;e will be taken about them; for that now the Government will not be &s;o much troubling it&s;elf to find out the Authors of them, but as often as any &s;uch Papers are found on the Tables of Coffee-Hou&s;es, or other News-Hou&s;es, the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e &s;hall be an&s;werable for &s;uch Papers, and &s;hall be pro&s;ecuted as the Pub|li&s;her of them, and let him find out the Author, Letter-Writer, or Printer, and
<PB N="68" REF="226">
take Care, at his Peril, what Papers he takes in.</P>
<P>This la&s;t was a Maiden Home-Circuit, which had not been known before, and is to be attributed to the late good Law of Tran&s;portation, which is well put in Ex|ecution in the Counties near <HI>London,</HI> whence Tran&s;porting is ea&s;y, but not &s;o well in other Parts of <HI>England.</HI> The Trea&s;ury would &s;ave much Money, partly by paying fewer Rewards of forty Pounds, and partly by not long maintaining Fel|lows in Gaol, if &s;ome Rates were agreed to be given to Merchants to carry them off &s;peedily.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip's Order of Notification, to the Ju&s;tices of Peace, had a very good Effect, for they appeared much better this Circuit than formerly, e&s;pecially in <HI>Surrey,</HI> where I told them, that I would reque&s;t your Lord&s;hip, that you would plea&s;e to acquaint his Maje&s;ty, at his Return, how very well, in particular, his Ju&s;tices of Peace in <HI>Surrey</HI> had appeared, upon his Plea&s;ure being notified to them for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I did, in all my Charges, inform the Audience of the Occa&s;ion and Nece&s;&s;ity of that Notification, for that there was grown a Sort of general Neglect, all over <HI>England,</HI> of the Appearance of the Ju&s;tices of Peace
<PB N="69" REF="227">
at the A&s;&s;izes, when the Judges had often Matters to inform them of, by Command of his Maje&s;ty; and Trials of Felons were often imperfect, by the Non-attendance of the committing Ju&s;tice of Peace; and that their Attendance was a Re&s;pect due to the King and his Government, upon tho&s;e &s;olemn Occa&s;ions: and that it is no Hard|&s;hip upon them; there being three Excu&s;es, which will be readily admitted, if, upon the Call, mentioned to the Court, barely upon the Word of &s;ome other Ju&s;tice, or Proof upon Oath by &s;ome other Per&s;on. <HI>viz.</HI> 1. If not fit to travel, by Age or want of Health. 2. If living out of the County. 3. If then actually out of the County. But if Ju&s;tices of Peace &s;hall remain at home, about their private Affairs, or to avoid the Trouble of a Journey to the A&s;&s;izes, it ought to be looked on as a Neglect of the Duty of their Office: for they are not called only to notify to the People, that they are in Commi&s;&s;ion, but to an&s;wer to their Names in Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Many of tho&s;e in Commi&s;&s;ion do not act, and have not taken the Oath of Of|fice: whereupon I ordered, in open Court, each Clerk of the Peace, again&s;t next Term, to tran&s;mit to your Lord&s;hip a Li&s;t of &s;uch as re&s;ide in the County, and refu&s;e to act; yet that he does, in the mean time,

<P>I fear I have tired your Lord&s;hip with this long, tho' abridged, Account: but your Lord&s;hip's Pardon will be an Addition to all your former Favours, to</P>

Who by his Almighty Power in one Moment created the Heaven and Earth; who&s;e &s;econd Thoughts cannot be more perfect than his fir&s;t; and, therefore,</P>

<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> the Hi&s;torical Books (Part of the Old Te&s;tament) to be wrote, as other Books are, by faithful Hi&s;torians; and that they contain certain &s;elect things worthy of Ob&s;ervation, and for In&s;truction, in order to the directing our Affairs in this World, and the Adoration of one God.

<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> Chri&s;t to have been a great and good Man; conceived, born, died, and was buried as other Holy-Men. For I cannot think him God Omni&s;cient, &s;ince he Him|&s;elf &s;aith, that <HI>he did not know the time of the Day of Judgment, but the Father only.</HI> (Mark, Cap. 13. v. 32.)</P>
<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> he may be preferred to a nearer Participation in the Beatific Vi&s;ion of God, than the re&s;t of good Men, to incline them to live peaceably and inoffen&s;ively in this World, and to the Adoration of an Eternal Being.</P>
<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> the &s;everal Religions of this World, &s;o far as they center in the Wor|&s;hip of his Holy-Name, and conduce to well Living, to be equally acceptable to him.</P>
<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> no Per&s;on hath Power to remit Sins but God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I think the Mercy of God &s;o much a greater Attribute than his Ju&s;tice, that he will not puni&s;h eternally for a temporary Fault; &s;ince mo&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the Law of Nature, meet with &s;ome Part of their Puni&s;hment in this World, and that there cannot be a Rational Being, who can deny a Deity and the Providence thereof.</P>

<P>IF obliging Expre&s;&s;ions, fine Wit, and noble Sentiments can tempt; you have the mo&s;t infallible Way of compelling your Friends to write to you, of any body I know; yet &s;hould my Ignorance in the Modes of writing cau&s;e you to e&s;teem me le&s;s, I &s;hall repent my having learnt to write.</P>
<P>Your excellent Judgment, and the Diffi|dence I ju&s;tly bear to my own Abilities, al|ways put a Check to that &s;incere and ho|ne&s;t Warmth I am impatient to addre&s;s you with: But when I reflect on your many Friendly Indulgencies, and &s;ee two kind Let|ters of yours now before me (both un|an&s;wer'd) I plunge in Ink, le&s;t my Silence &s;hould be more criminal than Impertinence it&s;elf. Remember, however, it is in com|pliance to your Reque&s;t, and no fancied Skill of mine, in drawing Characters. You are

very &s;ingular in your Inquiry after Mr. *** Morals; &s;uch Que&s;tions are very uncommon here.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;De moribus ultima fiet</L><L>Quae&s;tio&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Ought I not, my Friend, to be cautious in di&s;covering the Blemi&s;hes and Defects of this my native Spot, to One &s;o re&s;olutely deter|mined to Publi&s;h all the Truths he knows of it, even the wor&s;t, with the Sincerity and Ju|&s;tice of an unconcerned Hi&s;torian. Now, methinks, I &s;ee you &s;mile, and ask me, What is it you thus endeavour to conceal? Is not the Fidelity of your I&s;land become a Proverb; your Policy a Je&s;t; your Politene&s;s, Wantonne&s;s and Mimickry; your Commerce, a Combination of protected Thieves, the Bane of Indu&s;try and Trade? Nor is there any other Sign of Divinity or Liberty re|maining with you, except the opening of your Churches and the Courts of Ju&s;tice; in a Word it is become the Characteri&s;tic of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> that they account it le&s;s Glo|rious to act wi&s;ely, than to defend the do|ing otherwi&s;e. Yes, there is too much Truth in your Remarks, the Remembrance of Vir|tue is almo&s;t lo&s;t, and if any retain Senti|ments of Hone&s;ty and Religion they mu&s;t be very &s;ecret, if they would e&s;cape the

<P>Were no &s;mall Temptation to engage him with the Vain, the Gay, and the Vi|cious.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL the Books which have been Pub|li&s;hed here, worthy Notice, I have con&s;tantly &s;ent as you directed; if I have with-held my Opinion of their Merit, as you complain, it was for many Rea&s;ons I judged it unnece&s;&s;ary.

But &s;ince you &s;eek &s;ome Particulars of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> who&s;e Writings I profe&s;s, among&s;t Thou&s;ands, to be an Ad|mirer of, as I have often intimated; I will take this Occa&s;ion to inform you what I know concerning him. Many Pieces of his, The E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m. The Rape of the Lock. The E&s;&s;ays and Di&s;&s;ertations on <HI>Ho|mer,</HI> have appeared in your Parts: and one Proof of their Excellency, is their being na|turalized by Per&s;ons of very eminent Ability and Rank<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See our former Volume.</NOTE>. Other Languages<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They have been tran&s;lated both into <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian.</HI></NOTE> are inrich'd
<PB N="154" REF="312">
with the&s;e and others of his Works; yet, would you believe it, He has tran&s;lated <HI>Homer,</HI> pre&s;erved the Sublimity, Strength, Harmony, Clo&s;ene&s;s, and every other Ex|cellence of that venerable Poet, without knowing a Syllable of <HI>Greek;</HI> and with an ab&s;olute Ignorance of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> His E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m, is a &s;mooth Repetition of <HI>Vida's</HI> Non&s;en&s;e. His Pa&s;torals are no Pa&s;to|rals. Nor is he a Poet. The&s;e things are brayed about our Street. The <HI>A&s;inorum cre|pitus,</HI> the Din of <HI>Grub&s;treet,</HI> Pretenders to Poetry, and fal&s;e Critics, have aro&s;e to poi&s;on our Judgments; &s;ome &s;ay he is too little to write Well; others that he has only a Knack of writing, and the&s;e Wretches all write them&s;elves, to convince us it is without a Knack; Cellars are full of their Mur|murings, where, like &s;o many mercile&s;s Chy|mi&s;ts, they violently rack and torture Na|ture to confe&s;s &s;ome Worth &s;he has not in her. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is accounted by tho&s;e, not his Enemies, of over-much Borrowing; this you will rather prai&s;e then di&s;approve, when you &s;hall know, that the fine&s;t Thoughts of the be&s;t Writers were never made u&s;e of by him, till he had improved and made them bet|ter. View him in his Public Character, he is an Honour to our Nation; the Good and Wi&s;e rejoice, that &s;uch and &s;o notable a Genius is manife&s;ted among&s;t us; he has
<PB N="155" REF="313">
the Satisfaction of not having lived in vain, and has obliged the valuable Part of Man|kind, and is beloved by all the Learned, Good, and Wi&s;e. View him in Private Life, there is nothing more amiable and en|dearing. He is an Example of the Duty we owe our Parents, and the Love we ought to bear our Friends.

I &s;hall be every Day more &s;en|&s;ible of the Lo&s;s of you here, which I hope you will make up to me, by let|ting me hear often from you.

The fir&s;t Opportunity I have, I &s;hall certainly return his Rudene&s;s. When you can do it conveniently, put my Lord <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> in

Mind of what we have often di&s;cour&s;ed about, in Relation to the Affairs of <HI>France,</HI> and what he was &s;o kind as to &s;ay he would prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, when I had the Honour of &s;eeing him la&s;t.

<P>We hear of the Complaints you make from Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Tallard,</HI> and prepare to redre&s;s them as well as we can. As to the Per&s;ons mentioned in your Letter, Care will be taken.</P>

We take it to be our Play to do nothing again&s;t common Sen&s;e or common Law, and to be for tho&s;e who will &s;upport the Crown, rather than oblige their Party; and in order to this, Men are preferred who are looked upon to be hone&s;t and moderate. In this Number (whether with Rea&s;on or not, Time mu&s;t decide) we comprehend our Lord-Keeper and our new Secretary. Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> are in the Cabinet-Council; the latter is at the Head of the Trea&s;ury; the former (we take it for granted) is to go Lord-Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> though it be yet a Secret. The two Companies are to be brought to an Agreement. (if po&s;&s;ible) and Mr. <HI>Montague</HI>'s being made a Peer (we take for granted) may con|tribute

to this Union, &s;ince, being in the Hou&s;e of Commons, he would make an ill Figure, if he either declined to &s;up|port the new, or &s;hould find too great an Oppo&s;ition in his endeavouring &s;o to do. As to the Great Affair, I pre&s;ume the King will wholly defer it to the Parlia|ment, and act conjointly with their Con|&s;ent, which I take to be the only Method. All that I can &s;ay more on this Head is, that I take it to be happy for the King, that the Will is preferred, by the <HI>French,</HI> at a Time when every Body was peevi&s;h again&s;t the Court (though with Rea&s;on God knows) about the Treaty. Count <HI>Tallard</HI> makes a fooli&s;h Figure here: I do not know, as yet, what he &s;ays to the King on this Occa&s;ion; but every Body ob&s;erves his Excellency to be very melan|choly and de&s;ponding, and one may judge he has Rea&s;on to be &s;o, as to his own Particular, concerning the Part he has been made to act, however his Country in general may approve their Monarch's Breach of Truth and Treaty. This I think is the pre&s;ent Figure of our Affairs, which I am glad to write to &s;o good a Friend as my Lord <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> though to mo&s;t of the World here, I am of Opi|nion that to &s;ay lea&s;t is to do be&s;t.

As to my own Affairs, I have a great many Friends who would &s;et me up at <HI>Cambridge:</HI> I know I &s;hall find great Oppo&s;ition from Mr. <HI>Ham|mond</HI>'s Party there, and great Trouble, in ca&s;e I &s;hould throw him out, from tho&s;e Men, who will never be &s;atisfied, let me act as I will or can.

<P>HAving your Maje&s;ty's Permi&s;&s;ion to try if the Waters would contribute to the Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of my Health, I was ju&s;t got to this Place when I had the Honour of your Commands. I thought the be&s;t Way of executing them would be to communicate to my Lord <HI>Orf.</HI> Mr. <HI>Mont.</HI> and the D. of <HI>Shrew.</HI> (who before I left <HI>London</HI> had agreed upon a Meet|ing about that Time) the Subject of my Lord <HI>P</HI>'s Letters, at the &s;ame Time let|ting them know how &s;trictly Your Ma|je&s;ty required, that it &s;hould remain an inviolable Secret.</P>
<P>Since them Mr. M. and my Secretary are come down hither; and, upon their whole Di&s;cour&s;e, three Things have prin|cipally occurred, and are humbly &s;ugge&s;t|ed to your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the entertaining a Propo&s;al of this Nature &s;eems to be attended with very many ill Con&s;equences, if the <HI>F.</HI> did not act a &s;incere Part. But we were &s;oon at Ea&s;e as to any Apprehen&s;ion of this Sort; being fully a&s;&s;ured Your Maje&s;ty
<PB N="42" REF="361">
would not act but with the utmo&s;t Nice|ty in an Affair wherein the Glory, and the Safety of <HI>Europe</HI> were &s;o highly con|cerned.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd Thing con&s;idered was, the very ill Pro&s;pect of what was like to happen upon the Death of the King of <HI>Sp.</HI> in Ca&s;e nothing was done, previou&s;ly, towards the providing again&s;t that Acci|dent, which &s;eemed probably to be very near; the King of <HI>F.</HI> having &s;o great a Force, in &s;uch a Readine&s;s, that he was in a Condition to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Sp.</HI> before any other Prince could be ready to make a Stand. Your Maje&s;ty is the be&s;t Judge, whether this be the Ca&s;e, who are &s;o perfectly informed of the Circum&s;tances of Parts abroad. But &s;o far as relates to <HI>England,</HI> it would be Want of Duty not to give Your Maje&s;ty this clear Account, That there is a Dead|ne&s;s and Want of Spirit in the Nation univer&s;ally, &s;o as not at all to be di&s;po&s;ed to the Thought of entering into a new War, and that they &s;eemed to be tired out with Taxes, to a Degree beyond what di&s;cerned, till it appeared upon the Occa&s;ion of the late Elections. This is the Truth of the Fact, upon which Your Maje&s;ty will determine what Re&s;olutions are proper to be taken.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="43" REF="362">
3. That which remained was, the Con|&s;ideration what would be the Condition of <HI>Europe,</HI> if the Propo&s;al took Place. Of this we thought our&s;elves little capa|ble of judging: But it &s;eemed, that if <HI>Si|cily</HI> was in the Hands of the <HI>F.</HI> they would be entirely Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Levant</HI> Trade; that if they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Final,</HI> and tho&s;e Ports on that Side, whereby <HI>Milan</HI> would be intirely &s;hut out from Relief or any other Commerce, that Duchy would be of little Signification in the Hands of any Prince; and that if the King of <HI>F.</HI> was in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any Part of <HI>Guipu&s;coa,</HI> which is mentioned in the Propo&s;al, be&s;ides the Ports he would have in the Ocean, it does &s;eem he would have as ea&s;y a Way of invading <HI>Sp.</HI> on that Side, as he now has on the Side of <HI>Catalonia.</HI> But it is not to be hoped, that <HI>F.</HI> will quit its Pretences to &s;o great a Succe&s;&s;ion, without con&s;idera|ble Advantages; and we are all a&s;&s;ured your Maje&s;ty will reduce the Terms as low as can be done, and make them as far as is po&s;&s;ible in the pre&s;ent Circum|&s;tances of Things, &s;uch as may be &s;ome Foundation of the future Quiet of the Kingdom; which all your Subjects can|not but be convinced is your true Aim. If it could be brought to pa&s;s, that <HI>Eng|land</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="363">
might be &s;ome Way a Gainer by this Tran&s;action, whether it was by the Elec|tor of <HI>Bavaria</HI> (who is the Gainer by your Maje&s;ty's Interpo&s;ition in this Trea|ty) his coming to an Agreement to let us have &s;ome Trade to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Planta|tions, or in any other Manner, it would wonderfully indear your Maje&s;ty to your <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects.</P>
<P>It does not appear, in Ca&s;e this Nego|ciation &s;hould proceed, what is to be done on your Part, in Order to make it take Place; whether any more be re|quired than that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;it &s;till, and <HI>F.</HI> it&s;elf is to &s;ee it executed; and if that be &s;o, what Security ought to be expected, that, if our being nearer the <HI>French</HI> be &s;ucce&s;sful, they will con|fine them&s;elves to the Terms of the Trea|ty, and not attempt to make farther Ad|vantages of their Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>I have put the Seal to the Commi&s;&s;ion, without expecting the Return of the Warrant. The Commi&s;&s;ion is written by Mr. Secretary, and no Creature has the lea&s;t Knowledge of any Thing, be&s;ides the Per&s;ons already named.

<P>LA&s;t Night I came to this Place, where I received the Favour of yours, of the 18th In&s;tant, with a Copy
<PB N="47" REF="366">
of the Memorial of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vryberge.</HI> I have &s;ince waited on the Pen&s;ionary, to acquaint him that her Maje&s;ty did in|tirely concur with the States-General in that Affair, and that I had Orders to u&s;e what Diligence I could for <HI>Vienna,</HI> in Order to prevent any Alteration of the Project, concerted with the Duke of <HI>Sa|voy,</HI> for carrying the War into <HI>France,</HI> on that Side.

<P>I Had not Time to write to you from <HI>Du&s;&s;eldorp,</HI> neither was their any Thing material that required Ha&s;te. I came thither on the 4th, about Noon; and I had an Audience of the Elector this Evening: where, after a Compliment in the Name of her Maje&s;ty, I acquainted him with my Orders, in Relation to his Intere&s;ts at the Court of <HI>Vienna;</HI> and that the Queen's Mini&s;ter, who was go|ing to re&s;ide there, would have the &s;ame In&s;tructions. He expre&s;&s;ed a very great Sen&s;e of her Maje&s;ty's Goodne&s;s to him, and he did enter into the whole Matter of his Right to the <HI>Upper-Palatinate,</HI> with &s;ome Warmth, complaining of the U&s;age of that Court. He mentioned, be|&s;ides his &s;everal Titles, al&s;o a Treaty between the late Emperor and him, where|in it is agreed, that he &s;hall be put in Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion:
<PB N="49" REF="368">
which is &s;ince renewed by the pre&s;ent Emperor. I told him, it was of the la&s;t Importance, that his Troops in <HI>Italy</HI> &s;hould be immediately recruited; that her Maje&s;ty did not doubt but he had put it in &s;uch a Method as that I might find them &s;o at my Arrival in <HI>Italy.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I very much fear it, though I am per&s;uaded he will do all that is po&s;|&s;ible, for he &s;eemed not to di&s;gui&s;e the Difficulties he was under; as that his Of|ficers were but lately arrived from <HI>Italy,</HI> and that the la&s;t Accounts he had, were that his Troops were at the Blockade of <HI>Cremona;</HI> that he was buying a Battalion at <HI>On&s;pach,</HI> and that nothing &s;hould be wanting that was in his Power to do. As to the Affair on the <HI>Upper-Rhine,</HI> he &s;ays, there will be an Army of 60,000 Men; that the Emperor will make his 12,000; the <HI>Circles</HI> have agreed on 20,000. This, with the Re&s;t who are there, and will be there, makes up the Num|ber: That there was al&s;o Care taken for a &s;ufficient Quantity of Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> His two chief Mini&s;ters were to &s;ee me, and I did find them agree in every Thing the Elector had told me. I did pre&s;s them al&s;o about the Recruits in <HI>Italy.</HI> The next Day I had an Audience of the Electore&s;s, and in the Evening I took
<PB N="50" REF="369">
Leave of both them. I need not mention the Expre&s;&s;ions they both made U&s;e of in Relation to her Maje&s;ty, and how great a Sen&s;e they &s;hould ever have of it. The Electore&s;s recommended to me the Inte|re&s;t of their Hou&s;e, and al&s;o that of <HI>Flo|rence.</HI> I found by the Elector, that the Great Duke had agreed to pay 100,000 Pi&s;toles; but that the <HI>Imperial</HI> Court in&s;i&s;ted on 300,000, which he thought very extravagant, and which they &s;eemed to own at <HI>Vienna,</HI> but that they thought it ju&s;t, &s;ince he contributed, and was one of the chief In&s;truments in procuring the Will in Favour of the Duke of <HI>Anjou.</HI> That they threatened to &s;end Troops thi|ther, as al&s;o to <HI>Genoua,</HI> in Ca&s;e they would not pay what was demanded. I cannot tell what may be the Con&s;equence, in Ca&s;e the <HI>Imperial</HI> Court &s;hould carry this Matter too far. But if the&s;e Sums are actually employed in carrying on the War in <HI>Italy,</HI> we have no great Rea&s;on to complain.

<P>BY the la&s;t Po&s;t I acquainted my Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> with my Pro|ceedings here; and I have every little to add. The Emperor returns from <HI>Luxen|burg</HI> to-day, and I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall have my Audience of the Empre&s;s to-morrow. That of the Empre&s;s Dowager is over.

What makes them more zealous in that Matter is, the Apprehen|&s;ion that, in <HI>Holland,</HI> they might be brought to con&s;ent to the di&s;membering it from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy; and if once they are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, <HI>England</HI> will never con&s;ent to it.

They wait, with a great Deal of Impatience the Succe&s;s of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough.</HI> Count <HI>Piper</HI> did deliver a Memorial to the Emperor's Mi|ni&s;ters, in Relation to the Battalion of <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> in &s;uch Terms that he could not receive it. They did afterwards make &s;ome Alterations, but in Sub&s;tance it is the &s;ame. You will &s;oon &s;ee the true In|tentions of this Court, in Relation to the Malecontents; for they have &s;eemed of late to de&s;ire an Accommodation; but it was on &s;uch Terms that they might ea&s;ily judge were impo&s;&s;ible. So that Matter is at an End, and they have procured a Bull, from the Pope, for the excommu|nicating of Prince <HI>Rogotzky,</HI> and the Re&s;t of the con&s;iderable Men of the Catholics.

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received this Morning the Honour of your Excellency's Letter of <HI>April</HI> 30. I am heartily glad your Excellency has had &s;o much Succe&s;s as to &s;hake that Court from their &s;peculative Expedition again&s;t <HI>Naples:</HI> but I am very &s;orry, that the Misfortune of our Army in <HI>Spain</HI> is an irre&s;i&s;tible Argument to lay a&s;ide whol|ly that Project. The Accounts we have of this Di&s;a&s;ter are only got from <HI>France;</HI> yet they bring too many Marks of Truth not to be credited, &s;o far as that we have received a very great Lo&s;s there. The Queen has done all that is po&s;&s;ible on the &s;udden Event; and, in this great Uncer|tainty, Orders are gone, this Night, to encourage the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> to keep firm to the Alliance, and likewi&s;e to <HI>Hol|land,</HI> to con&s;ult with them the be&s;t Way to recover the Blow: But all this will be to no Purpo&s;e, unle&s;s the Emperor will exert him&s;elf on this Occa&s;ion, not only to lay a&s;ide the Expedition to <HI>Naples,</HI> to pu&s;h vigorou&s;ly into <HI>France,</HI> but al&s;o to

act offen&s;ively upon the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The&s;e are Points which the Queen hath &s;o much at Heart, that her Maje&s;ty hath written to the Emperor, with her own Hand. It follows this which I inclo&s;e herewith to your Excellency, that you may plea&s;e to deliver it with all po&s;&s;ible Speed, and that you may be the better apprized of it. I inclo&s;e al&s;o a Copy for your own Pe|ru&s;al. Your Excellency will inforce it with &s;uch Arguments as you will find, according to your own Sagacity, may be&s;t incline H. I.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GIVE me Leave to &s;peak my Mind to you a little; &s;ure you will, becau&s;e you know whatever I &s;hall &s;ay, proceeds from my Value for you. Con&s;ider that a Surgeon mu&s;t probe a Wound if he would make a perfect Cure; and give Pain to give Health. Would a Per&s;on in his Sences, whom I &s;hould &s;ave from drown|ing, by pulling him out by the Hair, quarrel with me for hurting him, when he is &s;afe out of the Water; therefore &s;ay, down, down <HI>Self,</HI> and read what follows.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity, common Humanity, and my Profe&s;&s;ion obliges me to do every Bo|dy all the real Service I can; but the Civility, the kind and friendly Welcome, which you have always received me with, does more particularly oblige me to do all I can to promote your Satisfaction; therefore let me put you in a Way to be
<PB N="63" REF="382">
ea&s;y in this World, and happy in the next. Don't imagine now that you are fated to be unhappy: There's no &s;uch Thing: God puts it in all our Powers to be happy; it is we make our&s;elves mi&s;e|rable: The Rea&s;on we don't find Happi|ne&s;s, is, that we &s;eek it <HI>without</HI> us, and would rather bring Things to agree with our Humour, than &s;uit our Humour to what happens. Let us do as <HI>Mahomet</HI> did, when he called to the Mountain to come to him, to &s;hew a Miracle to his gaping Di&s;ciples, and the &s;ullen Moun|tain did not &s;tir: He &s;aid to them, with all the Chearfulne&s;s in the World, &s;ince the Mountain will not come to <HI>Mahomet, Mahomet</HI> &s;hall go to the Mountain; and &s;o climbing up he plea&s;ed the People, and was perfectly &s;atisfied him&s;elf. Since therefore Happine&s;s is to be found only within, give me Leave to draw your Picture, by &s;etting the Mirror of Truth before you; which if you view atten|tively, and without Partiality, you'll find your Happine&s;s and lay hold of it: I don't mean your outward Form; or what fluttering Fellows call Ro&s;es, Lillies, Dia|monds, Pearls, Balls of Snow, and Bow|ers of Bli&s;s; &s;hould I attempt it I might do you as much Wrong as the Painter has done: I don't mean what may be &s;een or
<PB N="64" REF="383">
felt, but what may be heard or under|&s;tood: Your In&s;ide therefore is doubly, compo&s;ed of <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Self,</HI> which God having made, united together like Man and Wife: Now they can never be parted from one another whil&s;t Life continues, and yet they often jar by the Devil's &s;ub|tle Arts, who continually endeavours to &s;et them at Variance; in which when he &s;ucceeds he makes a Per&s;on mi&s;erable: But when <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Self</HI> go Hand in Hand, <HI>Soul,</HI> like a good Hu&s;band, by his &s;trong Rea&s;on, governing with ea&s;y Sway, and <HI>Self,</HI> diffident of her own Strength, gladly &s;ubmitting to be govern|ed; how ble&s;s'd are both! Guardian Angels attend to protect them, and no|thing from without can di&s;turb their Hap|pine&s;s: But if <HI>Soul</HI> happens to be pu&s;il|lanimous or tyrannical; or if <HI>Self</HI> gets it in her Head to wear the Breeches, then all the Guardian Angels leave <HI>Self,</HI> and the Devil &s;ends Evil Genii to take Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;tir up all the Pa&s;&s;ions to be|come Tormentors of <HI>Self,</HI> which before that, were all her Servants very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and u&s;eful when <HI>Soul</HI> helped to keep them under. On the other Hand, the Evil Genii are &s;o continually contending with harra&s;&s;ing <HI>Soul</HI>'s Guardians, that they grow tired, and &s;oon &s;leep, regardle&s;s of
<PB N="65" REF="384">
their Charge; then does Unhappine&s;s fill the whole mortal Frame; then it is we feel all the Racks and Tortures po&s;&s;ible; and if we are now and then ea&s;y, it is when we are in mo&s;t Danger; it is then the black Genii have put on the Apparel of the &s;leeping Angel, and makes us mi&s;|take Evil for Good: This is my poor Friend's Ca&s;e at pre&s;ent; but <HI>Soul</HI> has &s;till Force enough left to overcome <HI>Self,</HI> and Rea&s;on to bring it to a right Tem|per, if we can but rou&s;e <HI>Soul</HI>'s Guardi|ans to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which we will do, by drawing <HI>Self</HI>'s Picture as it is at pre|&s;ent; but I am afraid you'll &s;carce know or own it, on Account of its Deformity: But if you do know it, and bring it to an <HI>Examen,</HI> a little Conver&s;ation with <HI>Soul</HI> will &s;trangely mend it, and then Rea&s;on will make the Colours have a quite contrary Effect to Sir <HI>Godfrey Kneller</HI>'s; for they will brighten and beautify by Time, and the Picture which was &s;hock|ing will become the Admiration of all Beholders. I have been thus long before I begin to draw, to prepare you; and in Order to make you read with Patience, I promi&s;e you that <HI>Soul</HI>'s Picture which follows after this, will plea&s;e better.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="385">
Fir&s;t then, <HI>Self</HI> is plaguy forgetful&punc; &s;he does not remember that ever &s;he was younger or hand&s;omer; &s;he does not re|member that ever &s;he was wor&s;e in Cir|cum&s;tances, and much unhappier than &s;he is at pre&s;ent; &s;he does not remember the Time when &s;he was much le&s;s re&s;pected than &s;he is at pre&s;ent; &s;he does not re|member that &s;he was taught, and &s;hould believe, that Religion is the mo&s;t u&s;eful Thing in Life; and I am afraid poor <HI>Self</HI> has forgot to &s;ay her Prayers.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Self</HI> is very vain and arrogant; for <HI>Self</HI> does not attribute her good Suc|ce&s;s to the Ble&s;&s;ing and unbounded Mercy of Providence, but fancies that all is ow|ing to Wit and Beauty, and a fine Voice; but to &s;now you how much <HI>Self</HI> is mi&s;|taken, tho' you may have the&s;e Qualities, remember, that the Captain is no Judge, and all is a Gift from Heaven: It is a Sign of too much Arrogance in <HI>Self,</HI> to let the World, and every new Ac|quaintance &s;ee, that &s;he manages All, by too often expo&s;ing the Weakne&s;s of her Con&s;ort; for tho' &s;ome may prai&s;e that Spirit which conquers a Man, others will put wrong Con&s;tructions upon it, not only reflecting upon <HI>Self's Choice,</HI> which calls her Judgment in Que&s;tion, but &s;ay hard Things, tho' very unde&s;erved;
<PB N="67" REF="386">
and <HI>Self</HI> wont believe it without &s;he hears it; however, when <HI>Soul</HI> gets the Ma|nagement again, <HI>Self</HI> will only do it in Ca&s;es of Nece&s;&s;ity, and before particular Friends.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, Self</HI> is very &s;hort-&s;ighted, and a little Du&s;t, called <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> thrown into her Eyes, makes her quite blind; for otherwi&s;e &s;he would not do the very &s;ame Thing &s;he blames and di&s;likes in Others: <HI>Self</HI> will often &s;wallow down a Heap of Flattery offer'd by Sneerers, drink Poi&s;on becau&s;e &s;weeten'd with Honey, and believes the Givers to be &s;incere, tho' the next Moment they expo&s;e the Credulity of the Per&s;on who they here have been prai&s;ing: If they call her a Godde&s;s, &s;he believes her&s;elf Divine, and expects to be wor&s;hipped; if the next that comes pays no Homage, but is more &s;incere, and gives Advice or Re|proof, he is called an Enemy, or at lea&s;t &s;aid to be very ill bred; and if any comes to mortify her with direct Contradiction, &s;he could cru&s;h him to Atoms, and if &s;he has no Power to hurt him, &s;he will tear and pinch her own Fle&s;h. Tho' it was ridiculous in <HI>Teague</HI> to &s;ay, <HI>Arra Faith my Ma&s;ter, was my very good Friend and a Man of Sen&s;e, and I am a very ho|ne&s;t Man;</HI> and in &s;omebody el&s;e to &s;ay, <HI>Do you know what it is to affront one of</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="387">
<HI>my Character, I am a S&mdash;;</HI> yet if <HI>Self</HI> could remember, &s;he often &s;ays the very &s;ame Things in other Words. But when <HI>Soul</HI> teaches, <HI>Self,</HI> even as a Dart thrown from an Enemy that wounds, may be made u&s;eful; if the Point be taken off, it will prove a good Walking-Cane to help <HI>Self</HI> to go upright.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly, Self</HI> is very pa&s;&s;ionate, and therefore cannot bear to be controul'd; &s;he thinks him an Enemy that does it in Earne&s;t, and believes he can be no Friend that does it in Je&s;t: She mi&s;calls her Pa&s;&s;ions, not to part with them; Rage &s;he calls High-Spirit and Courage; and filling in with her Humour, True Friend|&s;hip; but &s;he is a great Coward; tho' &s;he can &s;cratch and tear: If I mi&s;take not, <HI>Self</HI> is terribly afraid of <HI>Self,</HI> and the Thoughts of being alone is a mo&s;t uncomfortable Pro&s;pect: To have One that we can unbo&s;om to without Re&s;erve or Fear, may be called having a Friend; but it is not natural Friend&s;hip to have One that &s;hall love where we love, and hate becau&s;e we hate, without any Re|gard to the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of every Pa&s;&s;ion, or the Ju&s;tice or Inju&s;tice of Af|fection and Re&s;entment; this is by no Means to be called Friend&s;hip; it is only a Union of Intere&s;t; God forbid that
<PB N="69" REF="388">
&s;hould be called Friend&s;hip. Can High|waymen be called Friends? Yet they do all this, they &s;ing together, they kill together, they eat, drink, and whore together; but as they don't act upon Principle, upon the lea&s;t Jar, or falling out, they hang one another. Friend&s;hip is a Virtue, and nothing of Crime can be con&s;i&s;tent with it: Follies and Weakne&s;|&s;es we cannot be without in this L &s;e; but a true Friend&s;hip is to pity and forgive, not to encourage them: It is having a Slave and fawning Para&s;ite, not a Fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, to have &s;uch a One as <HI>Self</HI> calls &s;o: A True Friend will advi&s;e, and repro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; and condemn <HI>Self</HI> for the Sake of <HI>Soul,</HI> even to the Hazard of di&s;obliging <HI>Self:</HI> A Friend mu&s;t help us to curb our Pa&s;&s;ions, refu&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tances in Things unju&s;t, en|deavour to engage Heaven in our Cau&s;e, when ju&s;t, and never let us alone till we apply al&s;o to the Almighty Power, and make Him our common Friend: In a Word, Friend&s;hip is directed by Right Rea&s;on, and cannot con&s;i&s;t without Chri&s;|tianity.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly, Self</HI> is a great Fop and agreat Slattern: <HI>Soul</HI> has given her very good Cloaths, fine Ornaments, plain and neat, but <HI>Self</HI> either leaves them, like a Slut, in every Corner of the Hou&s;e; or
<PB N="70" REF="389">
when &s;he puts them on, &s;he does bedizen them with Lace and Embroidery, Frin|ges and Ruffles, Patches, and Powder, that you can hardly &s;ee enough of the Garment to di&s;tingui&s;h the excellent Stuff which it is made of: <HI>Soul</HI> has given her a fine Gown, called <HI>Good Humour,</HI> who&s;e Out&s;ide was a cele&s;tial Blue, called <HI>Meekne&s;s,</HI> Lin'd with a white Per&s;ian, called <HI>Humility;</HI> what does <HI>Self,</HI> but throws off the Out&s;ide, &s;aying it was fooli&s;h Stuff, and tramples the Lining under Foot, &s;o that one could &s;carce know it: <HI>Soul</HI> had given her a Stomacher, call|ed <HI>Sincerity,</HI> and charg'd her to wear it only on <HI>Sundays</HI> and Holy-Days, and never to put it on without &s;erpentine Lace, called <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> with a Charge to let other People di&s;cover it, and not do as Court Ladies commonly do by their Cloaths, that is, &s;hew them to all their Acquaintance as &s;oon as they get them; but the giddy Thing wears it every Day, lo&s;es her Lace, and, as Children do, cries every Moment, who &s;ee my fine Stomacher; &s;o that it mu&s;t be a di&s;cerning Eye that knows it to be genuine: <HI>Soul</HI> gives her a fine Snuff-Box, in the Shape of a Heart, full of plain <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Snuff; <HI>Self</HI> throws it out, and fills it with Gunpowder and Hel|lebore: <HI>Soul</HI> gives her a Cen&s;or full of

<HEAD>A KEY To the FIRST VOLUME of Mr. POPE's Literary Corre&s;pondence.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1727 Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> purcha|&s;ed a Collection of Mr. <HI>Popes</HI>'s Let|ters to <HI>Henry Cromwell,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> writ|ten between the Years 1708, and 1711. The&s;e Letters Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in his Re|marks on the <HI>Dunciad</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BOOK II. Ver&s;e 66.</NOTE> &s;ays, were pro|cured by one Mrs. <HI>Thomas,</HI> while he was almo&s;t a Boy, which the Author was a&s;hamed of as very trivial Things; full not only of Levities, but of wrong Judg|ments of Men and Books, and only excu|&s;able from the Youth and Inexperience of the Writer.</P>
<P>We de&s;ire the Reader to ob&s;erve, That Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> being born on the 8th of <HI>June</HI> 1688, and the la&s;t of his Letters to Mr. <HI>Cromwell,</HI> bearing Date <HI>December</HI> 21 1711, proves Him to have been in the 23d Year of his Age. How inexperi|enced a Writer he was at that Time, we
<PB N="74" REF="393">
&s;hall not determine, but in the Year 1728 Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> him&s;elf publi&s;hed &s;ome Letters, which he wrote to Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> before he was 17 Years of Age: So that his Ex|perience, like a Crab, goes backwards: Mon&s;trous Ab&s;urdity!</P>
<P>The Letters between Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> open our Literary Corre|&s;pondence, about which there has been &s;uch an <HI>Eclat.</HI> There is little more to be &s;een in the&s;e Letters, but that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> rubs the old Bard's Back, and he in return chucks our young Poetical Saplin under the Chin.</P>
<P>In Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Account of Mr. <HI>Lintot</HI>'s Journey with him to <HI>Oxford,</HI> &s;peaking of Mr. <HI>Oldi&s;worth,</HI> I lo&s;t, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Lintot,</HI> by his <HI>Timothy</HI>'s.
