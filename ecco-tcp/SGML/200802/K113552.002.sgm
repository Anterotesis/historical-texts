<HEAD>THE EDITOR's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;choolmen had formerly a very exact way of computing the abilities of their Saints or authors. E&s;cobar, for in&s;tance, was &s;aid to have learning as five, genius as four, and gravity as &s;even. Caramuel was greater than he. His learning was as eight, his genius as &s;ix, and his gravity as thirteen. Were I to e&s;timate the merits of our Chine&s;e Philo&s;opher by the &s;ame &s;cale, I would not he&s;itate to &s;tate his genius &s;till higher; but as to his learning and gravity, the&s;e I think might &s;afely be marked as nine hundred and ninety nine, within one degree of ab&s;olute frigidity.</P>
<P>Yet upon his fir&s;t appearance here, many were angry not to find him as ignorant as a Tripoline amba&s;&s;ador, or an Envoy from Mujac. They were &s;urprized to find a man born &s;o far from London, that &s;chool of prudence and wi&s;dom, endued even with a moderate capacity. They expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame &s;urprize at his knowlege that the Chine&s;e do at ours. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Comte, Vol. 1. p. 210.</NOTE> <HI>How comes it,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>that the
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
Europeans, &s;o remote from China, think with &s;o much ju&s;tice and preci&s;ion? They have never read our books, they &s;carcely know even our letters, and yet they talk and rea&s;on ju&s;t as we do.</HI> The truth is, the Chine&s;e and we are pretty much alike. Different de|grees of refinement, and not of di&s;tance, mark the di&s;tinctions among mankind. Savages of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite climates, have all but one character of improvidence and rapacity; and tutored nations, however &s;eparate, make u&s;e of the very &s;ame me|thods to procure refined enjoyment.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinctions of polite nations are few; but &s;uch as are peculiar to the Chine&s;e, appear in every page of the following corre&s;pondence. The me|taphors and allu&s;ions are all drawn from the Ea&s;t. Their formality our author carefully pre&s;erves. Ma|ny of their favourite tenets in morals are illu&s;trated. The Chine&s;e are always conci&s;e, &s;o is he. Simple, &s;o is he. The Chine&s;e are grave and &s;ententious, &s;o is he. But in one particular, the re&s;emblance is peculiarly &s;triking: the Chine&s;e are often dull; and &s;o is he. Nor has my a&s;&s;i&s;tance been want|ing. We are told in an old romance of a certain knight errant and his hor&s;e who con|tracted an intimate friend&s;hip. The hor&s;e mo&s;t u&s;ually bore the knight, but, in ca&s;es of extra|ordinary di&s;patch, the knight returned the fa|vour, and carried his hor&s;e. Thus in the intima|cy between my author and me, he has u&s;ually given
<PB N="v" REF="6">
me a lift of his Ea&s;tern &s;ublimity, and I have &s;ome|times given him a return of my colloquial ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet it appears &s;trange in this &s;ea&s;on of panegy|ric, when &s;carce an author pa&s;&s;es unprai&s;ed either by his friends or him&s;elf, that &s;uch merit as our Philo&s;opher's &s;hould be forgotten. While the epi|thets of ingenious, copious, elaborate, and re|fined, are lavi&s;hed among the mob, like medals at a coronation, the lucky prizes fall on every &s;ide, but not one on him. I could on this occa&s;ion make my&s;elf melancholly, by con&s;idering the ca|priciou&s;ne&s;s of public ta&s;te, or the mutability of for|tune; but during this fit of morality, le&s;t my rea|der &s;hould &s;leep, I'll take a nap my&s;elf, and when I awake tell him my dream.</P>
<P>I imagined the Thames was frozen over, and I &s;tood by its &s;ide. Several booths were erected upon the ice, and I was told by one of the &s;pectators, that FASHION FAIR was going to begin. He added, that every author who would carry his works there, might probably find a very good reception. I was re&s;olved however to ob&s;erve the humours of the place in &s;afety from the &s;hore, &s;en&s;ible that ice was at be&s;t precarious, and having been always a little cowardly in my &s;leep.</P>
<P>Several of my acquaintance &s;eemed much more hardy thin I, and went over the ice with intrepi|dity.
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
Some carried their works to the fair on fledges, &s;ome on carts, and tho&s;e which were more voluminous, were conveyed in waggons. Their temerity a&s;toni&s;hed me. I knew their cargoes were heavy, and expected every moment they would have gone to the bottom. They all entered the fair, however, in &s;afety, and each &s;oon after returned to my great &s;urprize, highly &s;atisfied with his enter|tainment, and the bargains he had brought away.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch numbers at la&s;t began to operate upon me. If the&s;e, cried I, meet with favour and &s;afety, &s;ome luck may, perhaps, for once attend the unfortunate. I am re&s;olved to make a new adventure. The furniture, frippery and fire|works of China, have long been fa&s;hionably bought up. I'll try the fair with a &s;mall cargoe of Chi|ne&s;e morality. If the Chine&s;e have contributed to vitiate our ta&s;tle, I'll try how far they can help to improve our under&s;tanding. But as others have driven into the market in waggons, I'll cautiou&s;ly begin by venturing with a wheel-barrow. Thus re&s;olved, I baled up my goods and fairly ventured; when, upon ju&s;t entering the fair, I fancied the ice that had &s;upported an hundred waggons before, cracked under me; and wheel-barrow and all went to the bottom.</P>
<P>Upon awaking from my reverie, with the fright, I cannot help wi&s;hing that the pains taken in giving
<PB N="v" REF="8">
this corre&s;pondence an Engli&s;h dre&s;s, had been employed in contriving new political &s;y&s;tems, or new plots for farces. I might then have taken my &s;tation in the world, either as a poet or a phi|lo&s;opher; and made one in tho&s;e little &s;ocieties where men club to rai&s;e each others reputation. But at pre&s;ent I belong to no particular cla&s;s. I re&s;emble one of tho&s;e &s;olitary animals, that has been forced from its fore&s;t to gratify human curio|&s;ity. My earlie&s;t with was to e&s;cape unheeded through life; but I have been &s;et up for half-pence, to fret and &s;camper at the end of my chain. Tho' none are injured by my rage, I am naturally too &s;avage to court any friends by fawning. Too ob|&s;tinate to be taught new tricks; and too improvi|dent to mind what may happen, I am appea&s;ed, though not contented. Too indolent for intrigue, and too timid to pu&s;h for favour, I am&mdash;But what &s;ignifies what am I.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXIII.</HI> From Lien Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">l <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">tangi to Hingpo, by the way of Mo&s;cow.</HEAD>
<P>GENEROSITY properly applied will &s;up|ply every other external advantage in life, but the love of tho&s;e we conver&s;e with; it will pro|cure e&s;teem and a conduct re&s;embling real affec|tion, but actual love is the &s;pontaneous produc|tion of the mind, no genero&s;ity can purcha&s;e, no rewards encrea&s;e, nor no liberality continue it, the very per&s;on who is obliged, has it not in his power to force his lingring affections upon the object he &s;hould love, and voluntarily mix pa&s;&s;ion with gratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10">Imparted fortune, and well-placed liberality, may procure the benefactor good-will, may load the per&s;on obliged, with the &s;en&s;e of the duty he lies under to retaliate; this is gratitude: and &s;imple gratitude untinctured with love, is all the return an ingenuous mind can be&s;tow for former benefits.</P>
<P>But gratitude and love are almo&s;t oppo&s;ite affec|tions; love is often an involuntary pa&s;&s;ion, placed upon our companions without our con&s;ent, and fre|quently conferred without our previous e&s;teem. We love &s;ome men, we know not why; our tender|ne&s;s is naturally excited in all their concerns; we excu&s;e their faults with the &s;ame indulgence, and approve their virtues with the &s;ame applau&s;e with which we con&s;ider our own. While we entertain the pa&s;&s;ion it plea&s;es us, we cheri&s;h it with de|light, and give it up with reluctance, and love for love is all the reward we expect or de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Gratitude, on the contrary, is never conferred, but where there have been previous endeavours to excite it; we con&s;ider it as a debt, and our &s;pirits wear a load till we have di&s;charged the obligation. Every acknowledgment of gratitude is a circum&s;tance of humiliation; and &s;ome are found to &s;ubmit to frequent mortifications of this kind; proclaiming what obligations they owe, merely be|cau&s;e they think it in &s;ome mea&s;ure cancels the debt.</P>
<P>Thus love is the mo&s;t ea&s;y and agreeable, and gra|titude the mo&s;t humiliating affection of the mind; we never reflect on the man we <HI>love,</HI> without ex|ulting in our choice, while he who has bound us to him by <HI>benefits</HI> alone, ri&s;es to our idea as a per|&s;on
<PB N="3" REF="11">
to whom we have in &s;ome mea&s;ure, forfeited our freedom. Love and gratitude are &s;eldom therefore found in the &s;ame brea&s;t without impair|ing each other; we may tender the one or the other &s;ingly to tho&s;e we conver&s;e with, but can|not command both together. By attempting to en|crea&s;e, we dimini&s;h them; the mind becomes bank|rupt under too large obligations; all additional benefits le&s;&s;en every hope of future return, and bar up every avenue that leads to tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>In all our connexions with &s;ociety therefore, it is not only generous, but prudent, to appear in&s;en|&s;ible of the value of tho&s;e favours we be&s;tow, and endeavour to make the obligation &s;eem as &s;light as po&s;&s;ible. Love mu&s;t be taken by &s;tra|tagem, and not by open force: We &s;hould &s;eem ignorant that we oblige, and leave the mind at full liberty to give or refu&s;e its affections; for con&s;traint may indeed leave the receiver &s;till grate|ful, but it will certainly produce di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>If to procure gratitude be our only aim, there is no great art in making the acqui&s;ition; a benefit conferred demands a ju&s;t acknowledgment, and we have a right to in&s;i&s;t upon our due.</P>
<P>But it were much more prudent to forego our right on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and exchange it, if we can, for love. We receive but little advantage from repeated prote&s;tations of gratitude, but they co&s;t him very much from whom we exact them in return; exacting a grateful acknowledgement is demanding a debt by which the creditor is not ad|vantaged, and the debtor pays with reluctance.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12">As <HI>Mencius</HI> the Philo&s;opher was travelling in the pur&s;uit of wi&s;dom, night overtook him at the foot of a gloomy mountain, remote from the habitations of men. Here as he was &s;traying, while rain and thunder con&s;pired to make &s;olitude &s;till more hideous, he perceived a hermit's cell, and approaching, a&s;ked for &s;helter: Enter, cries the hermit, in a &s;evere tone, men de&s;erve not to be obliged, but it would be imitating their in|gratitude to treat them as they de&s;erve. Come in: examples of vice may &s;ometimes &s;trengthen us in the ways of virtue.</P>
<P>After a frugal meal, which con&s;i&s;ted of roots and tea, Mencius could not repre&s;s his curio&s;ity to know why the hermit had retired from man|kind, the actions of whom taught the true&s;t le&s;|&s;ons of wi&s;dom. Mention not the name of man, cries the hermit, with indignation; here let me live retired from a ba&s;e ungrateful world; here among the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t, I &s;hall find no flatterers; the lion is a generous enemy, and the dog a faithful friend, but man, ba&s;e man, can poi&s;on the bowl, and &s;mile while he pre&s;ents it. <HI>You have been u&s;ed ill by mankind?</HI> interrupted the philo&s;opher &s;hrewdly. Yes, returned the hermit, on mankind I have exhau&s;ted my whole fortune, and this &s;taff, and that cup, and tho&s;e roots are all that I have in return. <HI>Did you be&s;tow your fortune, or did you only lend it?</HI> returned Mencius. I be&s;towed it, undoubtedly, replied the other, for where were the merit of being a money lender? <HI>Did they ever own that they received it?</HI> &s;till adds the philo&s;opher. A thou&s;and times, cries the hermit, they every day loaded me with profe&s;&s;ions of gratitude, for obligations received, and &s;olicita|tions
<PB N="5" REF="13">
for future favours. <HI>If then,</HI> &s;ays Mencius, &s;miling, <HI>you did not lend your fortune, in order to have it returned, it is unju&s;t to accu&s;e th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">m of in|gratitude; they own'd them&s;elves obliged, you expected no more, and they certainly earn'd each favour by frequently acknowledging the obligation.</HI> The hermit was &s;truck with the reply, and &s;urveying his gue&s;t with emotion, I have heard of the great Mencius, and you certainly are the man; I am now four&s;core years old, but &s;till a child in wi&s;|dom, take me back to the &s;chool of man, and educate me as one of the mo&s;t ignorant and the younge&s;t of your di&s;ciples!</P>
<P>Indeed, my &s;on, it is better to have friends in our pa&s;&s;age through life than grateful dependants; and as love is a more willing, &s;o it is a more la&s;ting tribute than extorted obligation. As we are unea&s;y when greatly obliged, gratitude once refu&s;ed, can never after be recovered: the mind that is ba&s;e enough to di&s;allow the ju&s;t return, in&s;tead of feeling any unea&s;ine&s;s upon recollection, triumphs in its new acquired freedom, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure is plea&s;ed with con&s;cious ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>Very different is the &s;ituation of di&s;agreeing friends, their &s;eparation produces mutual unea&s;i|ne&s;s: Like that divided being in fabulous cre|ation, their &s;ympathetic &s;ouls once more de&s;ire their former union, the joys of both are imperfect, their gaye&s;t moments tinctured with unea&s;ine&s;s; each &s;eeks for the &s;malle&s;t conce&s;&s;ions to clear the way to a wi&s;hed for explanation; the mo&s;t trifling acknowledgement, the &s;lighte&s;t accident &s;erves to effect a mutual reconciliation.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="14">But in&s;tead of pur&s;uing the thought, permit me to &s;often the &s;everity of advice, by an Eu|ropean &s;tory which will fully illu&s;trate my mean|ing.</P>
<P>A fidler and his wife, who had rubbed through life, as mo&s;t couples u&s;ually do, &s;ometimes good friends, at others not quite &s;o well; one day hap|pened to have a di&s;pute, which was conducted with becoming &s;pirit on both &s;ides. The wife was &s;ure &s;he was right, and the hu&s;band was re|&s;olved to have his own way. What was to be done in &s;uch a ca&s;e? the quarrel grew wor&s;e by explanations, and at la&s;t the fury of both ro&s;e to &s;uch a pitch, that they made a vow never to &s;leep together in the &s;ame bed for the future. This was the mo&s;t ra&s;h vow that could be ima|gined, for they &s;till were friends at bottom, and be&s;ides they had but one bed in the hou&s;e; how|ever, re&s;olved they were to go through with it, and at night the fiddle-ca&s;e was laid in bed be|tween them, in order to make a &s;eparation. In this manner they continued for three weeks; every night the fiddle-ca&s;e being placed as a bar|rier to divide them.</P>
<P>By this time, however, each heartily repented of their vow, their re&s;entment was at an end, and their love began to return; they wi&s;hed the fiddle-ca&s;e away, but both had too much &s;pirit to begin. One night, however, as they were both lying awake with the dete&s;ted fiddle-ca&s;e between them, the hu&s;band happened to &s;neeze; to which the wife, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, bid God ble&s;s him; <HI>Ay, but,</HI> returns the hu&s;band, <HI>woman, do you &s;ay that from your heart?</HI> Indeed,
<PB N="7" REF="15">
I do, my poor Nicholas, cries his wife, I &s;ay it with all my heart. <HI>If &s;o then,</HI> &s;ays the hu&s;band, <HI>we had as good remove the fiddle-ca&s;e.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXIV.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>BOOKS, my &s;on, while they teach us to re&s;pect the intere&s;ts of others, often make us unmind|ful of our own; while they in&s;truct the youthful reader to gra&s;p at &s;ocial happine&s;s, he grows mi&s;e|rable in detail, and attentive to univer&s;al harmony, often forgets that he him&s;elf has a part to &s;u&s;tain in the concert. I di&s;like therefore the philo&s;opher who de&s;cribes the inconveniencies of life in &s;uch plea&s;ing colours that the pupil grows enamoured of di&s;tre&s;s, longs to try the charms of poverty, meets it without dread, nor fears its inconvenien|cies till he &s;everely feels them.</P>
<P>A youth, who has thus &s;pent his life among books, new to the world, and unacquainted with man, but by philo&s;ophic information, may be con|&s;idered as a being, who&s;e mind is filled with the vulgar errors of the wi&s;e; utterly unqualified for a journey through life, yet confident of his own &s;kill in the direction, he &s;ets out with confidence, blunders on with vanity, and finds him&s;elf at la&s;t undone.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t has learned from books, and then lays it down as a maxim, that all mankind are virtu|ous or vicious in exce&s;s; and he has been long
<PB N="8" REF="16">
taught to dete&s;t vice and love virtue: warm there|fore in attachments, and &s;tedfa&s;t in enmity, he treats every creature as a friend or foe; expects from tho&s;e he loves unerring integrity, and con|&s;igns his enemies to the reproach of wanting every virtue. On this principle he proceeds; and here begin his di&s;appointments: upon a clo&s;er in&s;pection of human nature, he perceives, that he &s;hould have moderated his friend&s;hip, and &s;often|ed his &s;everity; for he often finds the excellencies of one part of mankind clouded with vice, and the faults of the other brightened with virtue; he finds no character &s;o &s;anctified that has not its failings, none &s;o infamous, but has &s;omewhat to attract our e&s;teem; he beholds impiety in lawn, and fidelity in fetters.</P>
<P>He now therefore, but too late, perceives that his regards &s;hould have been more cool, and his hatred le&s;s violent; that the truly wi&s;e &s;eldom court romantic friend&s;hips with the good, and a|void, if po&s;&s;ible, the re&s;entment even of the wic|ked: every moment gives him fre&s;h in&s;tances that the bonds of friend&s;hip are broken if drawn too clo&s;ely, and that tho&s;e whom he has treated with di&s;re&s;pect more than retaliate the injury: at length therefore he is obliged to confe&s;s, that he has de|clared war upon the vicious half of mankind, with|out being able to form an alliance among the vir|tuous to e&s;pou&s;e his quarrel.</P>
<P>Our book-taught philo&s;opher, however, is now too far advanced to recede; and though poverty be the ju&s;t con&s;equence of the many enemies his conduct has created, yet he is re&s;olved to meet it without &s;hrinking: philo&s;ophers have de&s;cribed
<PB N="9" REF="17">
poverty in mo&s;t charming colours; and even his va|nity is touched, in thinking, that he &s;hall &s;hew the world, in him&s;elf, one more example of pati|ence, fortitude, and re&s;ignation. <HI>Come then, O Poverty! for what is there in thee dreadful to the</HI> WISE; <HI>temperance, health, and frugality, walk in thy train; cheerfulne&s;s and liberty are ever thy compa|nions. Shall any be a&s;hamed of thee of whom Cin|cinatus was not a&s;hamed? the running brook, the herbs of the field can amply &s;atisfy nature; man wants but little, nor that little long; come then, O Poverty, while kings &s;tand by and gaze with admiration, at the true philo&s;opher's re&s;ignation.</HI></P>
<P>The godde&s;s appears; for Poverty ever comes at the call: but alas! he finds her by no means the charming figure books and his warm imagina|tion had painted. As when an ea&s;tern bride whom her friends and relations had long de&s;cribed as a model of perfection, pays her fir&s;t vi&s;it, the long|ing bridegroom lifts the veil to &s;ee a face he had never &s;een before; but in&s;tead of a countenance, blazing with beauty like the &s;un, he beholds de|formity &s;hooting icicles to his heart; &s;uch appears Poverty to her new entertainer; all the fabric of enthu&s;ia&s;m is at once demoli&s;hed, and a thou&s;and mi&s;eries ri&s;e upon its ruins, while Contempt, with pointing finger, is foremo&s;t in the hideous proce&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The poor man now finds that he can get no kings to look at him while he is eating; he finds that in proportion as he grows poor, the world turns its back upon him, and gives him leave to act the philo&s;opher in all the maje&s;ty of &s;olitude; it might be agreeable enough to play the philo&s;o|pher,
<PB N="10" REF="18">
while we are con&s;cious that mankind are &s;pectators; but what &s;ignifies wearing the ma&s;k of &s;turdy contentment, and mounting the &s;tage of re|&s;traint, when not one creature will a&s;&s;i&s;t at the ex|hibition! Thus is he for&s;aken of men, while his fortitude wants the &s;atisfaction even of &s;elf-ap|plau&s;e; for either he does not feel his pre&s;ent cala|mities, and that is natural <HI>in&s;en&s;ibility,</HI> or he di&s;|gui&s;es his feelings, and that is <HI>di&s;&s;imulation.</HI></P>
<P>Spleen now begins to take up the man; not di&s;|tingui&s;hing in his re&s;entments, he regards all man|kind with dete&s;tation, and commencing man-hater, &s;eeks &s;olitude to be at liberty to rail.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that he who retires to &s;olitude, is either a bea&s;t or an angel, the cen&s;ure is too &s;e|vere, and the prai&s;e unmerited; the di&s;contented being, who retires from &s;ociety, is generally &s;ome good-natured man, who has begun life without experience, and knew not how to gain it in his in|tercour&s;e with mankind. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXV.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, fir&s;t pre&s;ident of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>I Formerly acquainted thee, mo&s;t grave <HI>Fum,</HI> with the excellence of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the art of heal|ing. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> boa&s;t their &s;kill in pul&s;es, the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> their botanical knowledge, but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> adverti&s;ing phy&s;icians alone, of being the great re|&s;torers of health, the di&s;pen&s;ers of youth, and
<PB N="11" REF="19">
the in&s;urers of longevity. I can never enough admire the &s;agacity of this country for the encou|ragement given to the profe&s;&s;ors of this art; with what indulgence does &s;he fo&s;ter up tho&s;e of her own growth, and kindly cheri&s;h tho&s;e that come from abroad. Like a &s;kilful gardener &s;he invites them from every foreign climate to her&s;elf. Here every great exotic &s;trikes root as &s;oon as imported, and feels the genial beam of favour; while the mighty metropolis, like one va&s;t munificent dunghill, receives them indi&s;criminately to her brea&s;t, and &s;upplies each with more than native nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>In other countries the phy&s;ician pretends to cure di&s;orders in the lump; the &s;ame doctor who com|bats the gout in the toe, &s;hall pretend to pre&s;cribe for a pain in the head, and he who at one time cures a con&s;umption, &s;hall at another give drugs for a drop&s;y. How ab&s;urd and ridiculous! this is being a mere jack of all trades. Is the animal machine le&s;s complicated than a bra&s;s pin? Not le&s;s than ten different hands are required to make a pin; and &s;hall the body be &s;et right by one &s;in|gle operator?</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are &s;en&s;ible of the force of this rea|&s;oning; they have therefore one doctor for the eyes, another for the toes; they have their &s;ciatica doctors, and inoculating doctors; they have one doctor who is mode&s;tly content with &s;ecuring them from bugbites, and five hundred who pre&s;cribe for the bite of mad dogs.</P>
<P>The learned are not here retired with vicious mode&s;ty from public view; for every dead wall is covered with their names, their abilities, their a|mazing

Few patients can e&s;cape falling into their hands, unle&s;s bla&s;ted by lightening, or &s;truck dead with &s;ome &s;udden di&s;order: it may &s;ometimes happen, that a &s;tranger who does not under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or a countryman who cannot read, dies without ever hearing of the vivifying drops, or re&s;torative electuary; but for my part, before I was a week in town, I had learned to bid the whole catalogue of di&s;orders de|fiance, and was perfectly acquainted with the names and the medicines of every great man, or great woman of them all.</P>
<P>But as nothing plea&s;es curio&s;ity more than anec|dotes of the great, however minute or trifling, I mu&s;t pre&s;ent you, inadequate as my abilities are to the &s;ubject, with &s;ome account of tho&s;e per&s;onages who lead in this honourable profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t upon the li&s;t of glory is doctor <HI>Ri|chard Rock</HI> F. U. N. This great man is &s;hort of &s;ta|ture, is fat, and waddles as he walks. He always wears a white three-tailed wig nicely combed, and frizzed upon each cheek. Sometimes he carries a cane, but a hat never; it is indeed very remarka|ble, that this extraordinary per&s;onage &s;hould never wear an hat, but &s;o it is he never wears an hat. He is u&s;ually drawn at the top of his own bills, &s;itting in his arm-chair, holding a little bottle be|tween his finger and thumb, and &s;urrounded with rotten teeth, nippers, pills, pacquets, and gally-pots. No man can promi&s;e fairer nor better than he; for, as he ob&s;erves, <HI>Be your di&s;order never &s;o far gone, be under no unea&s;ine&s;s, make your&s;elf quite ea&s;y, I can cure you.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="21">The next in fame, though by &s;ome reckoned of equal preten&s;ions, is doctor <HI>Timothy Franks,</HI> F. O. G. H. living in a place called the <HI>Old Bailey.</HI> As <HI>Rock</HI> is remarkably &s;quab, his great rival <HI>Franks</HI> is as remarkably tall. He was born in the year of the chri&s;tian aera 1692, and is, while I now write, ex|actly &s;ixty-eight years, three months, and four days old. Age, however, has no ways impaired his u&s;ual health and vivacity, I am told, he gene|rally walks with his brea&s;t open. This gentleman, who is of a mixed reputation, is particularly re|markable for a becoming a&s;&s;urance, which carries him gently through life; for, except doctor <HI>Rock,</HI> none are more ble&s;t with the advantages of face than doctor <HI>Franks.</HI></P>
<P>And yet the great have their foibles as well as the little. I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to mention it. Let the foibles of the great re&s;t in peace. Yet I mu&s;t impart the whole to my friend. The&s;e two great men are actually now at variance; yes, my dear <HI>Fum Hoam,</HI> by the head of our grandfather, they are now at variance like mere men, mere common mortals. The champion <HI>Rock</HI> advi&s;es the world to beware of bog trotting quacks, while <HI>Franks</HI> retorts the wit and the &s;arca&s;m (for they have both a world of wit) by fixing on his rival the odious appellation of <HI>Dumplin Dick.</HI> He calls the &s;erious doctor <HI>Rock, Dumplin Dick!</HI> Head of <HI>Confucius,</HI> what profanation! <HI>Dumplin Dick!</HI> What a pity, ye powers, that the learned, who were born mutually to a&s;&s;i&s;t in enlightening the world, &s;hould thus dif|fer among them&s;elves, and make even the profe&s;&s;ion ridiculous!

below them; and then we might &s;ee <HI>Rock</HI> and <HI>Franks</HI> walking together hand in hand, &s;miling on|ward to immortality.</P>
<P>Next to the&s;e is doctor <HI>Walker,</HI> preparator of his own medicines. This gentleman is remarkable for an aver&s;ion to quacks; frequently cautioning the public to be careful into what hands they com|mit their &s;afety; by which he would in&s;inuate that if they do not employ him alone, they mu&s;t be undone. His public &s;pirit is equal to his &s;ucce&s;s. Not for him&s;elf, but his country, is the gally-pot prepared and the drops &s;ealed up with proper di|rections for any part of the town or country. All this is for his country's good: &s;o that he is now grown old in the practice of phy&s;ic and virtue; and to u&s;e his own elegance of expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>There is not &s;uch another medicine as his in the world again.</HI></P>
<P>This, my friend, is a formidable triumvirate; and yet, formidable as they are, I am re&s;ol|ved to defend the honour of <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> phy&s;ic a|gain&s;t them all.

<P>It is plea&s;ant enough for a neutral being like me, who have no &s;hare in tho&s;e ideal calamities, to mark the &s;tages of this national di&s;ea&s;e. The ter|ror at fir&s;t feebly enters with a di&s;regarded &s;tory of a little dog, that had gone through a neighbouring village, that was thought to be mad by &s;everal that had &s;een him. The next account comes, that a ma&s;|tiff ran through a certain town, and had bit five gee&s;e, which immediately run mad, foamed at the bill, and died in great agonies &s;oon after. Then comes an affecting hi&s;tory of a little boy bit in the leg, and gone down to be dipt in the &s;alt water; when the people have &s;ufficiently &s;huddered at that, they are next congealed with a frightful account of a man who was &s;aid lately to have died from a bite he had received &s;ome years before. This relation only prepares the way for another, &s;till more hideous, as how the ma&s;ter of a family, with &s;even &s;mall children, were all bit by a mad lap dog, and how the poor father fir&s;t perceived the infection by calling for a draught of water, where he &s;aw the lap dog &s;wimming in the cup.</P>
<P>When epidemic terror is thus once excited, every morning comes loaded with &s;ome new di&s;|a&s;ter; as in &s;tories of gho&s;ts each loves to hear the account, though it only &s;erves to make him unea&s;y, &s;o here each li&s;tens with eagerne&s;s, and adds to the tidings with new circum&s;tances of pe|culiar horror.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXVIII.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, fir&s;t pre&s;i|dent of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>THE People of <HI>London</HI> are as fond of walking as our friends at <HI>Pekin</HI> of riding; one of the principal entertainments of the citizens here in &s;ummer is to repair about nightfall to a garden not far from town, where they walk about, &s;hew their be&s;t cloaths and be&s;t faces, and li&s;ten to a concert provided for the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I accepted an invitation a few evenings ago from my old friend, the man in black, to be one of a party that was to &s;up there, and at the ap|pointed hour waited upon him at his lodgings. There I found the company a&s;&s;embled and ex|pecting my arrival. Our party con&s;i&s;ted of my friend in &s;uperlative finery, his &s;tockings rolled, a black velvet wai&s;tcoat which was formerly new, and his grey wig combed down in imitation of hair. A pawn-broker's widow, of whom, by the bye, my friend was a profe&s;&s;ed admirer, dre&s;&s;ed out in green dama&s;k, with three gold rings on every finger. Mr. <HI>Tibbs</HI> the &s;econd-rate beau, I have formerly de&s;cribed, together with his lady, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n flim&s;y &s;ilk, dirty gauze in&s;tead of linnen, and an hat as big as an umbrello.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="34">Our fir&s;t difficulty was in &s;ettling how we &s;hould &s;et out. Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> had a natural aver&s;ion to the water, and the widow being a little in fle&s;h, as warmly prote&s;ted again&s;t walking, a coach was therefore agreed upon; which being too &s;mall to carry five, Mr. <HI>Tibbs</HI> con&s;ented to &s;it in his wife's lap.</P>
<P>In this manner therefore we &s;et forward, being entertained by the way with the bodings of Mr. <HI>Tibbs,</HI> who a&s;&s;ured us, he did not expect to &s;ee a &s;ingle creature for the evening above the degree of a chee&s;emonger; that this was the la&s;t night of the gardens, and that con&s;equently we &s;hould be pe&s;tered with the nobility and gentry from <HI>Thames-&s;treet</HI> and <HI>Crooked-lane,</HI> with &s;everal other prophetic ejaculations probably in&s;pired by the unea&s;ine&s;s of his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The illuminations began before we arrived, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that upon entring the gardens, I found every &s;en&s;e overpaid with more than ex|pected plea&s;ure; the lights every where glimmer|ing through the &s;carcely moving trees; the full-bodied con&s;ort bur&s;ting on the &s;tillne&s;s of the night, the natural con&s;ort of the birds, in the more retired part of the grove, vying with that which was formed by art; the company gayly dre&s;&s;ed looking &s;atisfaction, and the tables &s;pread with various delacacies, all con&s;pired to &s;ill my imagination with the vi&s;ionary happine&s;s of the <HI>Arabian</HI> lawgiver, and lifted me into an exta&s;y of admiration. Head of <HI>Confucius,</HI> cried I to my friend, this is fine! this unites rural beauty with courtly magnificence, if we except the virgins of immortality that hang on every tree, and may be
<PB N="27" REF="35">
plucked at every de&s;ire, I don't &s;ee how this falls &s;hort of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s <HI>Paradi&s;e!</HI> As for virgins, cries my friend, it is true, they are a fruit that don't much abound in our gardens here; but if ladies as plenty as apples in autumn, and as complying as any <HI>ho&uuml;ry</HI> of them all can content you, I fancy, we have no need to go to heaven for Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>I was going to &s;econd his remarks, when we were called to a con&s;ultation by Mr. <HI>Tibbs</HI> and the re&s;t of the company, to know in what man|ner we were to lay out the evening to the greate&s;t advantage. Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> was for keeping the gen|teel walk of the garden, where &s;he ob&s;erved there was always the very be&s;t company; the widow, on the contrary, who came but once a &s;ea&s;on, was for &s;ecuring a good &s;tanding place to &s;ee the water-works, which &s;he a&s;&s;ured us would begin in le&s;s than an hour at farthe&s;t; a di&s;pute therefore began, and as it was managed between two of very oppo&s;ite characters, it threatned to grow more bitter at every reply. Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> wondered how people could pretend to know the polite world who had received all their rudi|ments of breeding behind a compter; to which the other replied; that tho' &s;ome people &s;at behind compters, yet they could &s;it at the head of their own tables too, and carve three good di&s;hes of hot meat whenever they thought proper, which was more than &s;ome people could &s;ay for them|&s;elves, that hardly knew a rabbet and onions from a green goo&s;e and goo&s;eberries.</P>
<P>It is hard to &s;ay where this might have ended, had not the hu&s;band, who probably knew the
<PB N="28" REF="36">
impetuo&s;ity of his wife's di&s;po&s;ition, propo&s;ed to end the di&s;pute by adjourning to a box, and try if there was any thing to be had for &s;upper that was &s;upportable. To this we all con&s;ented, but here a new di&s;tre&s;s aro&s;e, Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> would &s;it in none but a genteel box, a box where they might &s;ee and be &s;een, one, as they expre&s;&s;ed it, in the very focus of public view; but &s;uch a box was not ea&s;y to be obtained, for tho' we were perfectly convinced of our own gentility, and the gentility of our appearance, yet we found it a dif|ficult matter to per&s;uade the keepers of the boxes to be of our opinion; they cho&s;e to re&s;erve genteel boxes for what they judged more genteel company.</P>
<P>At la&s;t however we were fixed, tho' &s;omewhat ob&s;curely, and &s;upplied with the u&s;ual entertain|ment of the place. The widow found the &s;upper excellent, but Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> thought every thing dete&s;table: come, come, my dear, cries the hu&s;|band, by way of con&s;olation, to be &s;ure we can't find &s;uch dre&s;&s;ing here as we have at lord Crump's or lady Crimp's; but for Vauxhall dre&s;&s;ing it is pretty good; it is not their victuals indeed I find fault with, but their wine; their wine, cries he, drinking off a gla&s;s, indeed, is mo&s;t abominable.</P>
<P>By this la&s;t contradiction the widow was fairly conquered in point of politene&s;s. She perceived now that &s;he had no preten&s;ions in the world to ta&s;te, her very &s;en&s;es were vulgar, &s;ince &s;he had prai&s;ed dete&s;table cu&s;tard, and &s;macked at wretch|ed wine; &s;he was therefore content to yield the victory, and for the re&s;t of the night to li&s;ten and improve. It is true, &s;he would now and then forget her&s;elf, and confe&s;s &s;he was plea&s;ed, but
<PB N="29" REF="37">
they &s;oon brought her back again to mi&s;erable refinement. She once prai&s;ed the painting of the box in which we were &s;itting, but was &s;oon con|vinced that &s;uch paltry pieces ought rather to excite horror than &s;atisfaction; &s;he ventured again to commend one of the &s;ingers, but Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> &s;oon let her know, in the &s;tyle of a connoi&s;&s;eur, that the &s;inger in que&s;tion had neither ear, voice, nor judgment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tibbs</HI> now willing to prove that his wife's preten&s;ions to mu&s;ic were ju&s;t, entreated her to favour the company with a &s;ong; but to this &s;he gave a po&s;itive denial, for you know very well, my dear, &s;ays &s;he, that I am not in voice to day, and when one's voice is not equal to one's judgment, what &s;ignifies &s;inging; be&s;ides as there is no accompanyment, it would be but &s;poil|ing mu&s;ic. All the&s;e excu&s;es however were over|ruled by the re&s;t of the company, who, though one would think they already had mu&s;ic enough, joined in the intreaty. But particularly the widow, now willing to convince the company of her breeding, pre&s;&s;ed &s;o warmly that &s;he &s;eemed determined to take no refu&s;al. At la&s;t then the lady com|plied, and after humming for &s;ome minutes, be|gan with &s;uch a voice and &s;uch affectation, as I could perceive gave but little &s;atisfaction to any except her hu&s;band. He &s;at with rapture in his eye, and beat time with his hand on the table.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t ob&s;erve, my friend, that it is the cu&s;tom of this country, when a lady or gentleman happens to &s;ing, for the company to &s;it as mute and motionle&s;s as &s;tatues. Every feature, every limb mu&s;t &s;eem to corre&s;pond in fixed attention,
<PB N="30" REF="38">
and while the &s;ong continues, they are to remain in a &s;tate of univer&s;al petrefaction. In this morti|fying &s;ituation we had continued for &s;ome time, li&s;tening to the &s;ong, and looking with tranqui|lity, when the ma&s;ter of the box came to inform us, that the water-works were going to begin. At this information I could in&s;tantly perceive the widow bounce from her &s;eat; but correcting her&s;elf, &s;he &s;at down again, repre&s;&s;ed by motives of good breeding. Mrs. <HI>Tibbs,</HI> who had &s;een the water-works an hundred times, re&s;olving not to be interrupted, continued her &s;ong without any &s;hare of mercy, nor had the &s;malle&s;t pity on our impatience. The widow's face, I own, gave me high entertainment; in it I could plainly t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">d the &s;truggle &s;he felt between good breeding and curio&s;ity; &s;he talked of the water-works the whole evening before, and &s;eemed to have come merely in order to &s;ee them; but then &s;he could not bounce out in the very middle of a &s;ong, for that would be forfeiting all preten&s;ions to high life, or high-lived company ever after: Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> therefore kept on &s;inging, and we continued to li&s;ten, till at la&s;t, when the &s;ong was ju&s;t con|cluded, the waiter came to inform us that the water-works were over!</P>
<P>The water-works over, cried the widow! the water-works over already, that's impo&s;&s;ible, they can't be over &s;o &s;oon! It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s, re|plied the fellow, to contradict your lady&s;hip, I'll run again and &s;ee; he went, and &s;oon returned with a confirmation of the di&s;mal tidings. No ceremony could now bind my friend's di&s;appoint|ed mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he te&s;tified her di&s;plea&s;ure in the opene&s;t manner; in &s;hort, &s;he now began to find
<PB N="31" REF="39">
fault in turn, and at la&s;t, in&s;i&s;ted upon going home, ju&s;t at the time that Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> a&s;&s;ured the company, that the polite hours were going to begin, and that the ladies would in&s;tantaneou&s;ly be entertained with the horns. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXIX.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>NOT far from this city lives a poor tinker, who has educated &s;even &s;ons, all at this very time in arms and fighting for their country, and what reward do you think has the tinker from the &s;tate for &s;uch important &s;ervices? None in the world; his &s;ons, when the war is over, may probably be whipt from pari&s;h to pari&s;h as vaga|bonds, and the old man, when pa&s;t labour, may die a pri&s;oner in &s;ome hou&s;e of correction.</P>
<P>Such a worthy &s;ubject in China would be held in univer&s;al reverence; his &s;ervices would be re|warded, if not with dignities, at lea&s;t with an ex|emption from labour; he would take the left hand at fea&s;ts, and mandarines them&s;elves would be proud to &s;hew their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> laws puni&s;h vice, the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> laws do more, they reward virtue!</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the little encouragement given to matrimony here, I am not &s;urprized at the di&s;|couragements given to propagation. Would you believe it, my dear <HI>Fam Hoam,</HI> there are laws made, which even forbid the peoples marrying each other. By the head of <HI>Confucius</HI> I je&s;t not;
<PB N="32" REF="40">
there are &s;uch laws in being here; and yet their law-givers have neither been in&s;tructed among the <HI>Hottentot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> nor imbibed their principles of equity from the natives of <HI>Anamaboo.</HI></P>
<P>There are laws which ordain, that no man &s;hall marry a woman again&s;t her own con&s;ent. This, though contrary to what we are taught in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and though in &s;ome mea&s;ure a clog upon matrimony, I have no great objection to. There are laws which ordain, that no woman &s;hall marry again&s;t her father and mother's con&s;ent, unle&s;s arrived at an age of maturity; by which is un|der&s;tood tho&s;e years, when women with us are generally pa&s;t child-bearing. This mu&s;t be a clog upon matrimony, as it is more difficult for the lover to plea&s;e three than one, and much more difficult to plea&s;e old people than young ones. The laws ordain, that the con&s;enting couple &s;hall take a long time to con&s;ider before they marry, this is a very great clog, becau&s;e people love to have all ra&s;h actions done in a hurry. It is ordained, that all marriages &s;hall be proclaimed before celebration; this is a &s;evere clog, as many are a&s;hamed to have their marriage made public, from motives of vicious mode&s;ty, and many afraid from views of temporal intere&s;t. It is ordained, that there is nothing &s;acred in the ceremony, but that it may be di&s;&s;olved to all intents and purpo&s;es by the authority of any civil magi&s;trate. And yet oppo&s;ite to this it is ordained, that the prie&s;t &s;hall be paid a large &s;um of money for granting his &s;acred permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, my friend, that matrimony here is hedged round with &s;o many ob&s;tructions, that
<PB N="33" REF="41">
tho&s;e who are willing to break through or &s;ur|mount them mu&s;t be contented, if at la&s;t they find it a bed of thorns. The laws are not to blame, for they have deterred the people from engaging as much as they could. It is indeed be|come a very &s;erious affair in <HI>England,</HI> and none but &s;erious people are generally found willing to engage. The young, the gay, and the beautiful, who have motives of pa&s;&s;ion only to induce them, are &s;eldom found to embark, as tho&s;e inducements are taken away, and none but the old, the ugly, and the mercenary are &s;een to unite, who, if they have any po&s;terity at all, will probably be an ill-favoured race like them&s;elves.</P>
<P>What gave ri&s;e to tho&s;e laws might have been &s;ome &s;uch accidents as the&s;e. It &s;ometimes hap|pened, that a mi&s;er who had &s;pent all his youth, in &s;craping up money to give his daughter &s;uch a fortune as might get her a mandarin hu&s;band, found his expectations di&s;appointed at la&s;t, by her running away with his footman: this mu&s;t have been a &s;ad &s;hock to the poor di&s;con&s;olate parent, to &s;ee his poor daughter in a one hor&s;e chai&s;e, when he had de&s;igned her for a coach and &s;ix: what a &s;troke from Providence! to &s;ee his dear money go to enrich a beggar; all nature cried out at the profanation!</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happened al&s;o, that a lady who had inherited all the titles, and all the nervous complaints of nobility, thought &s;it to impair her dignity and mend her con&s;titution, by marrying a farmer; this mu&s;t have been a &s;ad &s;hock to her incon&s;olable relations, to &s;ee &s;o fine a flower &s;natched from a flouri&s;hing family, and planted
<PB N="34" REF="42">
in a dunghill; this was an ab&s;olute inver&s;ion of the fir&s;t principles of things.</P>
<P>In order therefore to prevent the great from be|ing thus contaminated by vulgar alliances, the ob|&s;tacles to matrimony have been &s;o contrived, that the rich only can marry among&s;t the rich, and the poor, who would leave celibacy, mu&s;t be content to encrea&s;e their poverty with a wife. Thus have their laws fairly inverted the inducements to matrimony; nature tells us, that beauty is the proper allurement of tho&s;e who are rich, and money of tho&s;e who are poor; but things here are &s;o contrived, that the rich are invited to mar|ry by that fortune which they do not want, and the poor have no inducement, but that beauty which they do not feel.</P>
<P>An equal diffu&s;ion of riches through any coun|try ever con&s;titutes its happine&s;s. Great wealth in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one &s;tagnates, and extreme po|verty with another keeps him in unambitious in|digence; but the moderately rich are generally active; not too far removed from poverty to fear its calamities, nor too near extreme wealth to &s;lacken the nerve of labour, they remain &s;till be|tween both in a &s;tate of continual fluctuation. How impolitic therefore are tho&s;e laws which pro|mote the accumulation of wealth among the rich, more impolitic &s;till in attempting to increa&s;e the depre&s;&s;ion on poverty.</P>
<P>Bacon the Engli&s;h philo&s;opher, compares money to manure, if gathered in heaps, &s;ays he, it does no good: on the contrary, it becomes offen&s;ive, but being &s;pread, though never &s;o think, over the
<PB N="35" REF="43">
&s;urface of the earth, it enriches the whole coun|try. Thus the wealth a nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es mu&s;t expatiate, or it is of no benefit to the public; it becomes rather a grievance, where matrimonial laws thus confine it to a few.</P>
<P>But this re&s;traint upon matrimonial community, even con&s;idered in a phy&s;ical light, is injurious. As tho&s;e who rear up animals take all po&s;&s;ible pains to cro&s;s the &s;train in order to improve the breed; &s;o in tho&s;e countries, where marriage is mo&s;t free, the inhabitants are found every age to improve in &s;tature and in beauty; on the contrary, where it is confined to a <HI>ca&s;t,</HI> a <HI>tribe,</HI> or an <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rd,</HI> as among the Gaurs, the Jews, or the Tar|tars, each divi&s;ion &s;oon a&s;&s;umes a family likene&s;s, and every tribe degenerates into peculiar de|formity. From hence it may be ea&s;ily inferred, that if the mandarines here are re&s;olved only to marry among each other, they will &s;oon produce a po&s;terity with mandarine faces; and we &s;hall &s;ee the heir of &s;ome honourable family &s;carce equal to the abortion of a country farmer.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a few of the ob&s;tacles to marriage here, and it is certain, they have in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;wered the end, for celibacy is both frequent and fa&s;hionable. Old batchelors appear abroad without a ma&s;k, and old maids, my dear <HI>Fum Hoam,</HI> have been ab&s;olutely known to ogle. To confe&s;s in friend&s;hip; if I were an Engli&s;hman, I fancy I &s;hould be an old batchelor my&s;elf; I &s;hould never find courage to run through all the adventures pre&s;cribed by the law. I could &s;ub|mit to court my mi&s;tre&s;s her&s;elf upon rea&s;onable terms, but to court her father, her mother, and
<PB N="36" REF="44">
a long tribe of cou&s;ins, aunts and relations, and then &s;tand the butt of a whole country church; I would as &s;oon turn tail and make love to her grandmother.</P>
<P>I can conceive no other rea&s;on for thus loading matrimony with &s;o many prohibitions, unle&s;s it be that the country was thought already too po|pulous, and this was found to be the mo&s;t effectual means of thinning it. If this was the motive, I cannot but congratulate the wi&s;e projectors on the &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;cheme. Hail, O ye dim-&s;ighted politicians, ye weeders of men! 'Tis yours to clip the wing of indu&s;try, and convert Hymen to a broker. 'Tis yours to behold &s;mall objects with a micro&s;copic eye, but to be blind to tho&s;e which require an extent of vi&s;ion. 'Tis yours, O ye di&s;cerners of mankind, to lay the line between &s;ociety, and weaken that force by dividing, which &s;hould bind with united vigour. 'Tis yours, to introduce national real di&s;tre&s;s, in order to avoid the imaginary di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a few. Your actions can be ju&s;tified by an hundred rea&s;ons like truth, they can be oppo&s;ed by but a few rea&s;ons, and tho&s;e rea&s;ons are true. Farewel.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXX.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi to Hinpgo, by the way of Mo&s;cow.</HEAD>
<P>AGE that le&s;&s;ens the enjoyment of life encrea&s;es our de&s;ire of living. Tho&s;e dangers, which, in the vigour of youth we had learned to de&s;pi&s;e, a&s;&s;ume now terrors as we grew old. Our caution
<PB N="37" REF="45">
encrea&s;ing as our years encrea&s;e, fear becomes at la&s;t the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion of the mind; and the &s;mall remainder of life is taken up in u&s;ele&s;s ef|forts to keep off our end, or provide for a continu|ed exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Strange contradiction in our nature, and to which even the wi&s;e are liable! If I &s;hould judge of that part of life which lies before me by that which I have already &s;een, the pro&s;pect is hideous. Experience tells me, that my pa&s;t enjoyments have brought no real felicity; and &s;en&s;ation a&s;&s;ures me, that tho&s;e I have felt are &s;tronger than tho&s;e which are yet to come. Yet experience and &s;en&s;ation in vain per&s;uade; hope, more powerful than either, dre&s;&s;es out the di&s;tant pro&s;pect in fancied beauty, &s;ome happine&s;s in long per&s;pective &s;till beckons me to pur&s;ue, and, like a lo&s;ing game&s;ter, every new di&s;|appointment encrea&s;es my ardour to continue the game.</P>
<P>Whence, my friend, this encrea&s;ed love of life, which grows upon us with our years; whence comes it, that we thus make greater efforts to pre|&s;erve our exi&s;tence, at a period when it becomes &s;carce worth the keeping? Is it that nature, attentive to the pre&s;ervation of mankind, encrea&s;es our wi&s;hes to live, while &s;he le&s;&s;ens our enjoyments; and, as &s;he robs the &s;en&s;es of every plea&s;ure, equips imagination in the &s;poil? Life would be in&s;upportable to an old man, who loaded with infirmities, feared death no more than when in the vigour of manhood; the num|berle&s;s calamities of decaying nature, and the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of &s;urviving every plea&s;ure, would at once induce him with his own hand to terminate the &s;cene of mi&s;ery; but happily the contempt of death for|&s;akes
<PB N="38" REF="46">
him at a time when it could only be preju|dicial; and life acquires an imaginary value, in proportion as its real value is no more.</P>
<P>Our attachment to every object around us en|crea&s;es, in general, from the length of our acquaint|ance with it. I would not chu&s;e, &s;ays a <HI>French</HI> philo&s;opher, to &s;ee an old po&s;t pulled up, with which I had been long acquainted. A mind long habituated to a certain &s;et of objects, in&s;en&s;ibly be|comes fond of &s;eeing them; vi&s;its them from ha|bit, and parts from them with reluctance: from hence proceed the avarice of the old in every kind of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. They love the world and all that it produces; they love life and all its advan|tages; not becau&s;e it gives them plea&s;ure, but be|cau&s;e they have known it long.</P>
<P>Chinvang, the Cha&s;te, a&s;cending the throne of China, commanded that all who were unju&s;tly de|tained in pri&s;on, during the preceding reigns, &s;hould be &s;et free. Among the number who came to thank their deliverer on this occa&s;ion, there ap|peared a maje&s;tic old man, who, falling at the em|peror's feet, addre&s;&s;ed him as follows: "Great father of China, behold a wretch, now eighty-five years old, who was &s;hut up in a dungeon at the age of twenty-two. I was impri&s;oned, though a &s;tranger to crime, or without being even confront|ed by my accu&s;ers. I have now lived in &s;olitude and darkne&s;s for more than fifty years, and am grown familiar with di&s;tre&s;s. As yet dazzled with the &s;plendour of that &s;un to which you have re|&s;tored me, I have been wandring the &s;treets to find &s;ome friend that would a&s;&s;i&s;t, or relieve, or remem|ber me; but my friends, my family, and relations,
<PB N="39" REF="47" MS="y">
are all dead, and I am forgotten. Permit me then, O Chinvang, to wear out the wretched remains of life in my former pri&s;on; the walls of my dungeon are to me more plea&s;ing than the mo&s;t &s;plendid palace; I have not long to live, and &s;hall be un|happy except I &s;pend the re&s;t of my days where my youth was pa&s;&s;ed; in that pri&s;on from whence you were plea&s;ed to relea&s;e me.</P>
<P>The old man's pa&s;&s;ion for confinement is &s;imi|lar to that we all have for life. We are habitu|ated to the pri&s;on, we look round with di&s;content, are di&s;plea&s;ed with the abode, and yet the length of our captivity only encrea&s;es our fondne&s;s for the cell. The trees we have planted, the hou&s;es we have built, or the po&s;terity we have begotten, all &s;erve to bind us clo&s;er to earth, and embitter our parting. Life &s;ues the young like a new acquaint|ance; the companion, as yet unexhau&s;ted, is at once in&s;tructive and amu&s;ing, 'tis company plea&s;es, yet for all this it is but little regarded. To us, who are declined in years, life appears like an old friend; its je&s;ts have been anticipated in former conver&s;ation; it has no new &s;tory to make us &s;mile, no new improvement with which to &s;ur|prize, yet &s;till we love it; de&s;titute of every agree|ment &s;till we love it; hu&s;band the wa&s;ting trea&s;ure with encrea&s;ed frugality, and feel all the poignancy of angui&s;h in the fatal &s;eparation.</P>
<P>Sir Philip Mordaunt was young, beautiful, &s;in|cere, brave, an Engli&s;hman. He had a complete for|tune of his own, and the love of the king his ma&s;|ter, which was equivalent to riches. Life open|ed all her trea&s;ure before him, and promi&s;ed a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of future happine&s;s. He came, ta&s;t|ed of the entertainment, but was di&s;gu&s;ted even in
<PB N="40" REF="48">
in the beginning. He profe&s;&s;ed an aver&s;ion to liv|ing, was tired of walking round the &s;ame circle; had tried every enjoyment, and found them all grow weaker at every repetition. "If life be in youth &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing, cried he to him&s;elf, what will it appear when age comes on; if it be at pre&s;ent in|different, &s;ure it will then be execrable. This thought embittered every reflection; till, at la&s;t, with all the &s;erenity of perverted rea&s;on, he ended the debate with a pi&s;tol! Had this &s;elf-deluded man been apprized, that exi&s;tence grows more de|&s;irable to us the longer we exi&s;t, he would have then faced old age without &s;hrinking, he would have boldly dared to live, and &s;erved that &s;ociety, by his future a&s;&s;iduity, which he ba&s;ely injured by his de&s;ertion. Adieu.</P>

<P>IN reading the news-papers here, I have reckon|ed up not le&s;s than twenty-five great men, &s;e|venteen very great men, and nine very extraordi|nary men in le&s;s than the compa&s;s of half a year. The&s;e, &s;ay the gazattes, are the men that po&s;terity are to gaze at with admiration; the&s;e the names that fame will be employed in holding up for the a&s;to|ni&s;hment of &s;ucceeding ages. Let me &s;ee &mdash; forty-&s;ix great men in half a year, amounts ju&s;t to nine|ty-two in a year. &mdash;I wonder how po&s;terity will be able to remember them all, or whether the peo|ple, in future times, will have any other bu&s;ine&s;s to mind, but that of getting the catalogue by heart.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="49">Does the mayor of a corporation make a &s;peech? he is in&s;tantly &s;et down for a great man. Does a pedant dige&s;t his common place book into a folio? he quickly becomes great. Does a poet &s;tring up trite &s;entiments in rhyme? he al&s;o be|comes the great man of the hour. How diminu|tive &s;oever the object of admiration, each is fol|lowed by a crowd of &s;till more diminutive admir|ers. The &s;hout begins in his train, onward he marches toward immortality, looks back at the pur&s;uing crowd with &s;elf-&s;atisfaction; catching all the oddities, the whim&s;ies, the ab&s;urdities, and the littlene&s;&s;es of con&s;cious greatne&s;s, by the way.</P>
<P>I was ye&s;terday invited by a gentleman to dinner, who promi&s;ed that our entertainment &s;hould con|&s;i&s;t of an haunch of veni&s;on, a turtle, and a great man. I came, according to appointment. The veni&s;on was fine, the turtle good, but the great man in&s;upportable. The moment I ventured to &s;peak, I was at once contradicted with a &s;nap. I attempted, by a &s;econd and a third a&s;&s;ault, to re|trieve my lo&s;t reputation, but was &s;till beat back with confu&s;ion. I was re&s;olved to attack him once more from entrenchment, and turned the conver|&s;ation upon the government of China: but even here he a&s;&s;erted, &s;napped, and contradicted as be|fore. Heavens, thought I, this man pretends to know China even better than my&s;elf! I looked round to &s;ee who was on my &s;ide, but every eye was fixed in admiration on the great man; I there|fore, at la&s;t thought proper to &s;it &s;ilent, and act the pretty gentleman during the en&s;uing conver&s;a|tion.</P>
<P>When a man has once &s;ecured a circle of admir|ers, he may be as ridiculous here as he thinks pro|per;
<PB N="42" REF="50">
and it all pa&s;&s;es for elevation of &s;entiment, or learned ab&s;ence. If he tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the common forms of breeding, mi&s;takes even a tea-pot for a tobacco-box, it is &s;aid, that his thoughts are fixed on more important objects: to &s;peak and act like the re&s;t of mankind is to be no greater than they. There is &s;omething of oddity in the very idea of greatne&s;s; for we are &s;eldom a&s;toni&s;hed at a thing very much re&s;embling our&s;elves.</P>
<P>When the Tartars make a Lama, their fir&s;t care is to place him in a dark corner of the temple; here he is to &s;it-half concealed from view, to regu|late the motion of his hands, lips, and eyes; but, above all, he is enjoined gravity and &s;ilence. This, however, is but the prelude to his apotheo&s;is: a &s;et of emi&s;&s;aries are di&s;patched among the people to cry up his piety, gravity, and love of raw fle&s;h; the people take them at their word, approach the La|ma, now become an idol, with the mo&s;t humble pro&s;tration; he receives their addre&s;&s;es without mo|tion, commences a god, and is ever after fed by his prie&s;ts with the &s;poon of immortality. The &s;ame receipt in this country &s;erves to make a great man. The idol only keeps clo&s;e, &s;ends out his little emi&s;|&s;aries to be hearty in his prai&s;e; and &s;traight, whether &s;tate&s;man or author, he is &s;et down in the li&s;t of fame, continuing to be prai&s;ed while it is fa&s;hionable to prai&s;e, or while he prudently keeps his minutene&s;s concealed from the public.</P>
<P>I have vi&s;ited many countries, and have been in cities without number, yet never did I enter a town which could not produce ten or twelve of tho&s;e little great men; all fancying them&s;elves
<PB N="43" REF="51">
known to the re&s;t of the world, and compliment|ing each other upon their exten&s;ive reputation. It is amu&s;ing enough when two of tho&s;e dome&s;tic prodigies of learning mount the &s;tage of ceremony, and give and take prai&s;e from each other. I have been pre&s;ent when a German doctor, for having pronounced a panegyric upon a certain monk, was thought the mo&s;t ingenious man in the world; till the monk &s;oon after divided this reputation by re|turning the compliment; by which means they both marched off with univer&s;al applau&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ame degree of unde&s;erved adulation that attends our great man while living, often al&s;o fol|lows him to the tomb. It frequently happens that one of his little admirers &s;its down big with the important &s;ubject, and is delivered of the hi&s;tory of his life and writings. This may properly be called the revolutions of a life between the fire|&s;ide and the ea&s;y-chair. In this we learn, the year in which he was born, at what an early age he gave &s;ymptoms of uncommon genius and appli|cation, together with &s;ome of his &s;mart &s;ayings, col|lected by his aunt and mother, while yet but a boy. The next book introduces him to the uni|ver&s;ity, where we are informed of his amazing progre&s;s in learning, his excellent &s;kill in darning &s;tockings, and his new invention for papering books to &s;ave the covers. He next makes his ap|pearance in the republic of letters, and publi&s;hes his folio. Now the colo&s;&s;us is reared, his works are eagerly bought up by all the purcha&s;ers of &s;carce books. The learned &s;ocieties invite him to be|come a member; he di&s;putes again&s;t &s;ome foreign|er with a long Latin name, conquers in the con|trover&s;y, is complimented by &s;everal authors of

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXII.</HI> To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are numbers in this city who live by writing new books; and yet there are thou|&s;ands of volumes in every large library unread and forgotten. This, upon my arrival, was one of tho&s;e contradictions which I was unable to ac|count for. Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid I, that there &s;hould be any demand for new books, before tho&s;e al|ready publi&s;hed are read? Can there be &s;o many employed in producing a commodity with which the market is already over&s;tocked; and with goods al&s;o better than any of modern manufacture!</P>
<P>What at fir&s;t view appeared an incon&s;i&s;tence, is a proof at once of this people's wi&s;dom and refine|ment. Even allowing the works of their ance&s;tors better written than theirs, yet tho&s;e of the moderns
<PB N="45" REF="53">
acquire a real value, by being marked with the im|pre&s;&s;ion of the times. Antiquity has been in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of others, the pre&s;ent is our own; let us fir&s;t therefore learn to know what belongs to our&s;elves, and then, if we have lei&s;ure, ca&s;t our reflections back to the reign of <HI>Shonou,</HI> who governed twenty thou&s;and years before the creation of the moon.</P>
<P>The volumes of antiquity, like medals, may very well &s;erve to amu&s;e the curious, but the works of the moderns, like the current coin of a kingdom, are much better for immediate u&s;e; the former are often prized above their intrin&s;ic value, and kept with care, the latter &s;eldom pa&s;s for more than they are worth, and are often &s;ubject to the mer|cile&s;s hands of &s;weating critics, and clipping com|pilers; the works of antiquity were ever prai&s;ed, tho&s;e of the moderns read; the trea&s;ures of our ance&s;tors have our e&s;teem, and we boa&s;t the pa&s;|&s;ion; tho&s;e of cotemporary genius engage our heart, although we blu&s;h to own it. The vi&s;its we pay the former re&s;emble tho&s;e we pay the great; the ceremony is trouble&s;ome, and yet &s;uch as we would not chu&s;e to forego; our acquaint|ance with modern books, is like &s;itting with a friend; our pride is not flattered in the interview, but it gives more internal &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>In proportion as &s;ociety refines, new books mu&s;t ever become more nece&s;&s;ary. Savage ru&s;ticity is reclaimed by oral admonition alone; but the ele|gant exce&s;&s;es of refinement are be&s;t corrected by the &s;till voice of &s;tudious enquiry. In a polite age, almo&s;t every per&s;on becomes a reader, and receives more in&s;truction from the pre&s;s than the pulpit. The preaching Bon&s;e may in&s;truct the illiterate
<PB N="46" REF="54">
pea&s;ant; but nothing le&s;s than the in&s;inuating ad|dre&s;s of a fine writer can win its way to an heart already relaxed in all the effeminacy of refinement. Books are nece&s;&s;ary to correct the vices of the po|lite, but tho&s;e vices are ever changing, and the antidote &s;hould be changed accordingly; &s;hould &s;till be new.</P>
<P>In&s;tead therefore of thinking the number of new publications here too great, I could wi&s;h it &s;till greater, as they are the mo&s;t u&s;eful in&s;truments of reformation. Every country mu&s;t be in&s;tructed either by <HI>writers</HI> or <HI>preachers</HI>; but as the number of readers encrea&s;es, the number of hearers is pro|portionably dimini&s;hed, the writer becomes more u&s;eful, and the preaching Bon&s;e le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of complaining that writers are overpaid, when their works procure them a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, I &s;hould imagine it the duty of a &s;tate not only to encourage their numbers, but their indu&s;try. A Bon&s;e is rewarded with im|men&s;e riches for in&s;tructing only a few, even of the mo&s;t ignorant, of the people; and &s;ure the poor &s;cholar &s;hould not beg his bread, who is ca|pable of in&s;tructing a million.</P>
<P>Of all rewards, I grant, the mo&s;t plea&s;ing to a man of real merit, is fame; but a polite age, of all times, is that in which &s;carce any &s;hare of me|rit can acquire it. What numbers of fine writers in the latter empire of Rome, when refinement was carried to the highe&s;t pitch, have mi&s;&s;ed that fame and immortality which they had fondly arro|gated to them&s;elves? How many Greek authors, who wrote at that period when Con&s;tantinople was
<PB N="47" REF="55">
the refined mi&s;tre&s;s of the empire, now re&s;t either not printed, or not read, in the libraries of Eu|rope! Tho&s;e who came fir&s;t, while either &s;tate as yet was barbarous, carried all the reputation away. Authors, as the age refined, became more numerous, and their numbers de&s;troyed their fame. It is but natural, therefore, for the writer, when con&s;cious that his works will not procure him fame hereafter, to endeavour to make them turn out to his temporal intere&s;t here.</P>
<P>Whatever be the motives which induce men to write, whether avarice or fame, the country be|comes mo&s;t wi&s;e and happy, in which they mo&s;t &s;erve for in&s;tructors. The countries where &s;acer|dotal in&s;truction alone is permitted, remain in ig|norance, &s;uper&s;tition, and hopele&s;s &s;lavery. In England, where there are as many new books publi&s;hed as in all the re&s;t of Europe together, a &s;pirit of freedom and rea&s;on reigns among the people; they have been often known to act like fools, they are generally found to think like men.</P>
<P>The only danger that attends a multiplicity of publications, is that &s;ome of them may be calcu|lated to injure, rather than benefit &s;ociety. But where writers are numerous, they al&s;o &s;erve as a check upon each other; and perhaps a literary inqui&s;ition is the mo&s;t terrible puni&s;hment that can be conceived, to a literary tran&s;gre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>But to do the Engli&s;h ju&s;tice, there are but few offenders of this kind, their publications in general aim at mending either the heart, or im|proving the common weal. The dulle&s;t writer talks of virtue, and liberty, and benevolence with
<PB N="48" REF="56">
e&s;teem; tells his true &s;tory, filled with good and whole&s;ome advice; warns again&s;t &s;lavery, bribery, or the bite of a mad dog, and dre&s;&s;es up his lit|tle u&s;eful magazine of knowledge and entertain|ment, at lea&s;t with a good intention. The dun|ces of France, on the other hand, who have le&s;s encouragement, are more vicious. Tender hearts, langui&s;hing eyes, Leonora in love at thirteen, extatic tran&s;ports, &s;tolen bli&s;&s;es, are the frivolous &s;ubjects of their frivolous memoirs. In England, if a baw|dy blockhead thus breaks in on the community, he &s;ets his whole fraternity in a roar; nor can he e&s;cape, even though he &s;hould fly to nobility for &s;helter.</P>
<P>Thus even dunces, my friend, may make them|&s;elves u&s;eful. But there are others whom nature has ble&s;t with talents above the re&s;t of mankind; men capable of thinking with preci&s;ion, and impre&s;|&s;ing their thought with rapidity. Beings who dif|fu&s;e tho&s;e regards upon mankind, which others con|tract and &s;ettle upon them&s;elves. The&s;e de&s;erve every honour from that community of which they are more peculiarly the children; to &s;uch I would give my heart, &s;ince to them I am indebted for its humanity! Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXIII.</HI> From Hingpo to Lien Chi Altangi, by the way of Mo&s;cow.</HEAD>
<P>I Still remain at <HI>Terki,</HI> where I have received that money which was remitted here in order to re|lea&s;e me from captivity. My fair companion &s;till
<PB N="49" REF="57">
improves in my e&s;teem; the more I know her mind her beauty becomes more poignant; &s;he ap|pears charming, even among the daughters of <HI>Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ca&s;&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Yet were I to examine her beauty with the art of a &s;tatuary, I &s;hould find numbers here that far &s;urpa&s;s her; nature has not granted her all the boa&s;ted <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian</HI> regularity of feature, and yet &s;he greatly exceeds the faire&s;t of the country, in the art of &s;eizing the affections. Whence, have I often &s;aid to my&s;elf, this re&s;i&s;tle&s;s magic that at|tends even moderate charms: though I regard the beauties of the country with admiration, every interview weakens the impre&s;&s;ion, but the form of Zelis grows upon my imagination, I never behold her without an encrea&s;e of tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect. Whence this inju&s;tice of the mind in preferring imperfect beauty to that which nature &s;eems to have fini&s;hed with care? whence the infatuation, that he whom a comet could not amaze, &s;hould be a&s;toni&s;hed at a meteor! When rea&s;on was thus fatigued to find an an&s;wer, my imagination pur|&s;ued the &s;ubject, and this was the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>I fancied my&s;elf placed between two land|&s;capes, this called the <HI>region of beauty,</HI> and that <HI>the valley of the graces</HI>; the one adorned with all that luxuriant nature could be&s;tow; the fruits of various climates adorned the trees, the grove re&s;ounded with mu&s;ic, the gale breathed per|fume, every charm that could ari&s;e from &s;ymmetry and exact di&s;tribution were here con&s;picuous, the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ering a pro&s;pect of plea&s;ure without end. <HI>The v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lley of the graces</HI> on the other hand, &s;eemed by
<PB N="50" REF="58">
no means &s;o inviting; the &s;treams and the groves appeared ju&s;t as they u&s;ually do in frequented coun|tries; no magnificent parterres, no con&s;ort in the grove, the rivulet was edged with weeds, and the rook joined its voice to that of the nightingale. All was &s;implicity and nature.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;triking objects ever fir&s;t allure the traveller, I entered the region of beauty with encrea&s;ed curio&s;ity, and promi&s;ed my&s;elf endle&s;s &s;atisfaction in being introduced to the pre&s;iding godde&s;s. I perceived &s;everal &s;trangers, who en|tered with the &s;ame de&s;ign, and what &s;urpri&s;ed me not a little, was to &s;ee &s;everal others ha&s;tening to leave this abode of &s;eeming felicity.</P>
<P>After &s;ome fatigue, I had at la&s;t the honour of being introduced to the godde&s;s, who repre&s;ented Beauty in per&s;on. She was &s;eated on a throne, at the foot of which &s;tood &s;everal &s;trangers lately introduced like me; all regarding her form in exta&s;y. <HI>Ah, what eyes! what lips! how clear her complexion! how perfect her &s;hape!</HI> at the&s;e excla|mations Beauty with downca&s;t eyes, would en|deavour to counterfeit mode&s;ty, but &s;oon again looking round as if to confirm every &s;pectator in his favourable &s;entiments, &s;ometimes &s;he would attempt to allure us by &s;miles; and at intervals would bridle back, in order to in&s;pire us with re&s;pect as well as tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>This ceremony la&s;ted for &s;ome time, and had &s;o much employed our eyes, that we had for|got all this while that the godde&s;s was &s;ilent. We &s;oon however began to perceive the defect: <HI>what,</HI> &s;aid we, among each other, <HI>are we to have
<PB N="51" REF="59">
nothing but langui&s;hing airs, &s;oft looks, and incli|nations of the head, will the godde&s;s only deign to &s;atisfy our eyes?</HI> Upon this one of the company &s;tepped up to pre&s;ent her with &s;ome fruits he had gathered by the way. She received the pre&s;ent, mo&s;t &s;weetly &s;miling, and with one of the white&s;t hands in the world, but &s;till not a word e&s;caped her lips.</P>
<P>I now found that my companions grew weary of their homage; they went off one by one, and re|&s;olving not to be left hehind, I offered to go in my turn; when ju&s;t at the door of the temple I was called back by a female, who&s;e name was <HI>Pride,</HI> and who &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed at the behaviour of the company. <HI>Where are you ha&s;tening?</HI> &s;aid &s;he to me with an angry air, <HI>the godde&s;s of beauty is here.</HI> I have been to vi&s;it her, Madam, replied I, and find her more beautiful even than report had made her. <HI>And why then will you leave her?</HI> added the female. I have &s;een her long enough, returned I; I have got all her features by heart. Her eyes are &s;till the &s;ame. Her no&s;e is a very fine one, but it is &s;till ju&s;t &s;uch a no&s;e now as it was half an hour ago: could &s;he throw a little more mind into her face, perhaps I &s;hould be for wi&s;hing to have more of her company. <HI>What &s;ignifies,</HI> replied my female, <HI>whether &s;he has a mind or not; has &s;he any occa&s;ion for a mind, &s;o formed as &s;he is by nature? If &s;he had a common face, in|deed, there might be &s;ome rea&s;on for thinking to im|prove it; but when features are already perfect, every alteration would but impair them. A fine face is already at the point of perfection, and a fine lady &s;hould endeavour to keep it &s;o; the impre&s;&s;ion it would
<PB N="52" REF="60">
receive from thought, would but di&s;turb its whole oeconomy.</HI></P>
<P>To this &s;peech I gave no reply, but made the be&s;t of my way to the valley of the Graces. Here I found all tho&s;e who before had been my companions in the region of beauty, now upon the &s;ame errand.</P>
<P>As we entered the valley, the pro&s;pect in&s;en&s;i|bly &s;eemed to improve; we found every thing &s;o natural, &s;o dome&s;tic, and plea&s;ing, that our minds, which before were congealed in admiration, now relaxed into gaiety and good-humour. We had de&s;igned to pay our re&s;pects to the pre&s;iding god|de&s;s, but &s;he was no where to be found. One of our companions a&s;&s;erted, that her temple lay to the right; another, to the left; a third, in&s;i&s;ted that it was &s;traight before us; and a fourth, that we had left it behind. In &s;hort, we found every thing familiar and charming, but could not determine where to &s;eek for the Grace in per&s;on.</P>
<P>In this agreeable incertitude we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal hours, and though very de&s;irous of finding the godde&s;s, by no means impatient of the delay. Every part of the valley pre&s;ented &s;ome minute beauty, which without offering it&s;elf at once, &s;tole within the &s;oul, and captivated us with the charms of our retreat. Still, however, we continued to &s;earch, and might &s;till have continued, had we not been interrupted by a voice which, though we could not &s;ee from whence it came, addre&s;&s;ed us in this manner:</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="61">"If you would find the godde&s;s of Grace, &s;eek her not under one form, for &s;he a&s;&s;umes a thou|&s;and, Ever changing under the eye of in&s;pection, her variety, rather than her figure, is plea&s;ing.

<P>THE Shops of London are as well furni&s;hed as tho&s;e of Pekin. Tho&s;e of London have a picture hung at their door, informing the pa&s;|&s;engers what they have to &s;ell, as tho&s;e at Pekin have a board to a&s;&s;ure the buyer, that they have no intentions to cheat him.</P>
<P>I was this morning to buy &s;ilk for a night-cap; immediately upon entering the mercer's &s;hop, the ma&s;ter and his two men, with wigs plai&s;tered with
<PB N="54" REF="62">
powder, appeared to a&s;k my commands. They were certainly the civille&s;t people alive; if I but looked, they flew to the place, where I ca&s;t my eye; every motion of mine &s;ent them running round the whole &s;hop for my &s;atisfaction. I in|formed them that I wanted what was good, and they &s;hewed me not le&s;s than forty pieces, and each was better than the former; the prettie&s;t pattern in nature, and the fitte&s;t in the world for night-caps. My very good friend, &s;aid I to the mercer, you mu&s;t not pretend to in&s;truct me in &s;ilks, I know the&s;e in particular to be no better than your mere flim&s;y <HI>Bungees. That may be,</HI> cried the mercer, who I afterwards found had never contradicted a man in his life, <HI>I can't pretend to &s;ay but they may; but I can a&s;&s;ure you, my Lady Trail has had a &s;acque from this piece this very morning.</HI> But friend, &s;aid I, though my Lady has cho&s;en a &s;acque from it, I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity that I &s;hould wear it for a night|cap. <HI>That may be,</HI> returned he again, <HI>yet what be|comes a pretty Lady, will at any time look well on a hand&s;ome Gentleman.</HI> This &s;hort compliment was thrown in &s;o very &s;ea&s;onably upon my ugly face, that even tho' I di&s;liked the &s;ilk, I de&s;ired him to cut me off the pattern of a night-cap.</P>
<P>While this bu&s;ine&s;s was con&s;igned to his journey|man, the ma&s;ter him&s;elf took down &s;ome pieces of &s;ilk &s;till finer than any I had yet &s;een, and &s;preading them before me, <HI>There,</HI> cries he, <HI>there's beauty, my Lord Snake&s;kin has be&s;poke the fellow to this for the birth-night this very morning; it would look charmingly in wai&s;tcoats.</HI> But I don't want a wai&s;tcoat, replied I: <HI>Not want a wai&s;tcoat,</HI> re|turned the mercer; <HI>then I would advi&s;e you to buy one; when wai&s;tcoats are wanted, you may depend
<PB N="55" REF="63">
upon it they will come dear. Always buy before you want, and you are &s;ure to be well u&s;ed, as they &s;ay in Cheap&s;ide.</HI> There was &s;o much ju&s;tice in his advice, that I could not refu&s;e taking it; be&s;ides, the &s;ilk, which was really a good one, encrea&s;ed the temptation, &s;o I gave orders for that too.</P>
<P>As I was waiting to have my bargains mea&s;ured and cut, which I know not how, they executed but &s;lowly; during the interval, the mercer enter|tained me with the modern manner of &s;ome of the nobility receiving company in their morning gowns; <HI>Perhaps, Sir,</HI> adds he, <HI>you have a mind to &s;ee what kind of &s;ilk is univer&s;ally worn.</HI> Without waiting for my reply, he &s;preads a piece before me, which might be reckoned beautiful even in China. <HI>If the nobility,</HI> continues he, <HI>were to know I &s;old this to any, under a Right Honourable, I &s;hould cer|tainly lo&s;e their cu&s;tom; you &s;ee, my Lord, it is at once rich, ta&s;tey, and quite the thing.</HI> I am no Lord, interrupted I.&mdash;<HI>I beg pardon,</HI> cried he, <HI>but be plea&s;ed to remember, when you intend buying a morning gown, that you had an offer from me of &s;ome|thing worth money. Con&s;cience, Sir, con&s;cience is my way of dealing; you may buy a morning gown now, or you may &s;tay till they become dearer and le&s;s fa&s;hi|onable, but it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to advi&s;e.</HI> In &s;hort, mo&s;t reverend <HI>Fum,</HI> he per&s;uaded me to buy a morning gown al&s;o, and would probably have per|&s;uaded me to have bought half the goods in his &s;hop, if I had &s;tayed long enough, or was fur|ni&s;hed with &s;ufficient money.</P>
<P>Upon returning home, I could not help reflect|ing with &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hment, how this very man with &s;uch a confined education and capacity, was
<PB N="56" REF="64">
yet capable of turning me as he thought proper, and molding me to his inclinations! I know he was only an&s;wering his own purpo&s;es, even while he attempted to appear &s;olicitous about mine; yet by a voluntary infatuation, a &s;ort of pa&s;&s;ion compound|ed of vanity and good nature, I walked into the &s;nare with my eyes open, and put my&s;elf to future pain in order to give him immediate plea&s;ure. The wi&s;dom of the ignorant, &s;omewhat re&s;embles the in&s;tinct of animals; it is diffu&s;ed in but a very narrow &s;phere, but within that circle it acts with vigour, uniformity, and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXV.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>FROM my former accounts you may be apt to fancy the Engli&s;h the mo&s;t ridiculous people under the &s;un. They are indeed ridiculous: yet every other nation in Europe is equally &s;o; each laughs at each, and the A&s;iatic at all.</P>
<P>I may, upon another occa&s;ion, point out what is mo&s;t &s;trikingly ab&s;urd in other countries; I &s;hall at pre&s;ent con&s;ine my&s;elf only to France. The fir&s;t national peculiarity a traveller meets upon entering that kingdom, is an odd &s;ort of a &s;taring vivacity in every eye, not excepting even the children; the people, it &s;eems, have got it into their heads that they have more wit than others, and &s;o &s;tare in order to look &s;mart.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="65">I know not how it happens, but there appears a &s;ickly delicacy in the faces of their fine&s;t women. This may have introduced the u&s;e of paint, and paint produces wrinkles; &s;o that a fine lady &s;hall look like an hag at twenty-three. But as in &s;ome mea&s;ure they never appear young, &s;o it may be equally a&s;&s;erted, that they actually think them|&s;elves never old; a gentle Mi&s;s &s;hall prepare for new conque&s;ts at &s;ixty, &s;hall hobble a rigadoon when &s;he can &s;carce walk without a crutch, &s;he &s;hall affect the girl, play her fan and her eyes, and talk of &s;entiments, bleeding hearts, and expiring for love, when actually dying with age. Like a departing philo&s;opher, &s;he attempts to make her la&s;t mo|ments the mo&s;t brilliant of her life.</P>
<P>Their civility to &s;trangers is what they are chiefly proud of; and to confe&s;s &s;incerely, their beggars are the very polite&s;t beggars I ever knew; in other places a traveller is addre&s;&s;ed with a piteous whine, or a &s;turdy &s;olemnity, but a French beggar &s;hall a&s;k your charity with a very genteel bow, and thank you for it with a &s;mile and a &s;hrugg.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of this people's breeding I mu&s;t not forget. An Engli&s;hman would not &s;peak his native language in a company of foreigners where he was &s;ure that none under&s;tood him; a travelling Hottentot him&s;elf would be &s;ilent if acquainted only with the language of his country; but a French|man &s;hall talk to you whether you under&s;tand his language or not; never troubling his head whether you have learned French, &s;till he keeps up the con|ver&s;ation, fixes his eye full in your face, and a&s;ks
<PB N="58" REF="66">
a thou&s;and que&s;tions, which he an&s;wers him&s;elf for want of a more &s;atisfactory reply.</P>
<P>But their civility to foreigners is not half &s;o great as their admiration of them&s;elves. Every thing that belongs to them and their nation is great; magnificent beyond expre&s;&s;ion; quite ro|mantic! every garden is a paradi&s;e, every hovel a palace, and every woman an angel. They &s;hut their eyes clo&s;e, throw their mouths wide open, and cry out in rapture: Sacre! What beauty! O Ciel, what ta&s;te! mort de ma vie, what grandeur, was ever any people like our&s;elves; we are the na|tion of men, and all the re&s;t no better than two-legged barbarians.</P>
<P>I fancy the French would make the be&s;t cooks in the world, if they had but meat; as it is, they can dre&s;s you out five different di&s;hes from a net|tle-top, &s;even from a dock leaf, and twice as ma|ny from a frog's haunches; the&s;e eat prettily e|nough when one is a little u&s;ed to them, are ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and &s;eldom overload the &s;tomach with crudities. They &s;eldom dine under &s;even hot di&s;hes; it is true, indeed, with all this magnifi|cence, they &s;eldom &s;pread a cloth before the gue&s;ts; but in that I cannot be angry with them; &s;ince tho&s;e who have got no linnen on their backs, may very well be excu&s;ed for wanting it upon their tables.</P>
<P>Even religion it&s;elf lo&s;es its &s;olemnity among them. Upon their roads, at about every five miles di&s;tance, you &s;ee an image of the Virgin Ma|ry dre&s;&s;ed up in grim head-cloaths, painted cheeks, and an old red petticoat; before her a lamp is of|ten
<PB N="59" REF="67">
&s;een burning, at which, with the &s;aint's per|mi&s;&s;ion, I have frequently lighted my pipe. In|&s;tead of the Virgin you are &s;ometimes pre&s;ented with a crucifix, at other times with a wooden Sa|viour, fitted out in complete garniture, with &s;ponge, &s;pear, nails, pincers, hammer, bees-wax, and vi|negar-bottle. Some of the&s;e images, I have been told, came down from heaven; if &s;o, in heaven they have but bungling workmen.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing through their towns, you frequently &s;ee the men &s;itting at the doors knitting &s;tockings, while the care of cultivating the ground and prun|ing the vines falls to the women. This is perhaps the rea&s;on why the fair &s;ex are granted &s;ome pe|culiar privileges in this country; particularly, when they can get hor&s;es, of riding without a &s;ide-&s;addle.</P>
<P>But I begin to think you may find this de&s;crip|tion pert and dull enough; perhaps it is &s;o, yet in general it is the manner in which the French u&s;ually de&s;cribe foreigners; and it is but ju&s;t to <HI>force</HI> a part of that ridicule back upon them, which they attempt to lavi&s;h on others.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXVI.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>THE two theatres, which &s;erve to amu&s;e the citizens here, are again opened for the win|ter. The mimetic troops, different from tho&s;e of
<PB N="60" REF="68">
the &s;tate, begin their campaign when all the others quit the field; and at a time when the Europeans cea&s;e to de&s;troy each other in reality, they are en|tertained with mock battles upon the &s;tage.</P>
<P>The dancing ma&s;ter once more &s;hakes his quiver|ing feet; the carpenter prepares his paradi&s;e of pa&s;teboard; the hero re&s;olves to cover his fore|head with bra&s;s, and the heroine begins to &s;cour up her copper tail, preparative to future operations; in &s;hort, all are in motion, from the theatrical letter-carrier in yellow cloaths, to Alexander the Great that &s;tands on a &s;tool.</P>
<P>Both hou&s;es have already commenced ho&s;tilities. War, open war! and no quarter received or given! Two &s;inging women, like heralds, have begun the conte&s;t; the whole town is divided on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion; one has the fine&s;t pipe, the other the fine&s;t manner; one curte&s;ies to the ground, the other &s;alutes the audience with a &s;mile; one comes on with mode&s;ty which a&s;ks, the other with boldne&s;s which extorts applau&s;e; one wears powder, the other has none; one has the longe&s;t wai&s;t, but the other appears mo&s;t ea&s;y; all, all is important and &s;erious; the town as yet per&s;everes in its neutrality, a cau&s;e of &s;uch moment demands the mo&s;t mature deliberation, they con|tinue to exhibit, and it is very po&s;&s;ible this con|te&s;t may continue to plea&s;e to the end of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>But the Generals of either army, have, as I am told, &s;everal reinforcements to lend occa&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tance. If they produce a pair of diamond buckles at one hou&s;e, we have a pair of eye-brows
<PB N="61" REF="69">
that can match them at the other. If we outdo them in our attitude, they can overcome us by a &s;hrug; if we can bring more children on the &s;tage, they can bring more guards in red cloaths, who &s;trut and &s;houlder their &s;words to the a&s;to|ni&s;hment of every &s;pectator.</P>
<P>They tell me here, that people frequent the theatre in order to be in&s;tructed as well as amu&s;ed. I &s;mile to hear the a&s;&s;ertion. If I ever go to one of their play-hou&s;es, what with trumpets, hallow|ing behind the &s;tage, and bawling upon it, I am quite dizzy before the performance is over. If I enter the hou&s;e with any &s;entiments in my head, I am &s;ure to have none going away, the whole mind being filled with a dead march, a funeral proce&s;&s;ion, a cat-call, a jigg, or a tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>There is perhaps nothing more ea&s;y than to write properly for the Engli&s;h theatre; I am amazed that none are apprenticed to the trade. The author, when well acquainted with the value of thunder and lightning, when ver&s;ed in all the my&s;tery of &s;cene-&s;hifting, and trap-doors; when &s;killed in the proper periods to introduce a wire-walker, or a water-fall; when in&s;tructed in every actor's peculiar talent, and capable of adapting his &s;peeches to the &s;uppo&s;ed excellence; when thus in&s;tructed, knows all that can give a modern audience plea&s;ure.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXVII.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE always regarded the &s;pirit of mercy, which appears in the Chine&s;e laws with admira|tion. An order for the execution of a criminal is carried from court by &s;low journies of &s;ix miles a day, but a pardon is &s;ent down with the mo&s;t rapid di&s;patch. If five &s;ons of the &s;ame father be guilty of the &s;ame offence, one of them is forgiven, in or|der to continue the family and comfort his aged parents in their decline.</P>
<P>Similar to this, there is a &s;pirit of mercy breathes through the laws of England, which &s;ome erroneou&s;ly endeavour to &s;uppre&s;s; the laws how|ever &s;eem unwilling to puni&s;h the offender, or to furni&s;h the officers of ju&s;tice with every means of acting with &s;everity. Tho&s;e who arre&s;t debtors are denied the u&s;e of arms, the nightly watch is permitted to repre&s;s the di&s;orders of the drunken citizens only with clubs; ju&s;tice in &s;uch a ca&s;e &s;eems to hide her terrors, and permits &s;ome of|fenders to e&s;cape rather than load any with a puni&s;hment di&s;proportioned to the crime.</P>
<P>Thus it is the glory of an Engli&s;hman, that he is not only governed by laws, but that the&s;e are
<PB N="64" REF="72">
al&s;o tempered by mercy; a country re&s;trained by &s;evere laws, and tho&s;e too executed with &s;everity (as in Japan) is under the mo&s;t terrible &s;pecies of tyranny; a royal tyrant is generally dreadful to the great, but numerous penal laws grind every rank of people, and chiefly tho&s;e lea&s;t able to re|&s;i&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, the poor.</P>
<P>It is very po&s;&s;ible, thus for a people to become &s;laves to laws of their own enacting, as the Athe|nians were to tho&s;e of Draco. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'It might fir&s;t happen (&s;ays the hi&s;torian) that men with pecu|liar talents for villainy attempted to evade the ordinances already e&s;tabli&s;hed; their practices therefore &s;oon brought on a new law levelled again&s;t them; but the &s;ame degree of cunning which had taught the knave to evade the former &s;tatutes, taught him to evade the latter al&s;o; he flew to new &s;hifts, while ju&s;tice pur&s;ued with new ordinances; &s;till however he kept his pro|per di&s;tance, and whenever one crime was judged penal by the &s;tate, he left committing it in order to practi&s;e &s;ome unforbidden &s;pecies of villainy. Thus the criminal again&s;t whom the threatenings were denounced always e&s;caped free; while the &s;imple rogue alone felt the rigour of ju&s;tice. In the mean time penal laws became numerous, almo&s;t every per&s;on in the &s;tate unknowingly at different times offended, and was every moment &s;ubject to a malicious pro&s;ecution.'</Q> In fact, penal laws, in&s;tead of preventing crimes, are ge|nerally enacted after the commi&s;&s;ion; in&s;tead of repre&s;&s;ing the growth of ingenious villainy, only multiply deceit, by putting it upon new &s;hifts and expedients of practi&s;ing with impunity.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="73">Such laws therefore re&s;emble the guards which are &s;ometimes impo&s;ed upon tributary Princes, apparently indeed to &s;ecure them from danger, but in reality, to confirm their captivity.</P>
<P>Penal laws, it mu&s;t be allowed, &s;ecure property in a &s;tate, but they al&s;o dimini&s;h per&s;onal &s;ecurity in the &s;ame proportion: There is no po&s;itive law how equitable &s;oever, that may not be &s;ometimes capable of inju&s;tice. When a law enacted to make theft puni&s;hable with death, happens to be equi|tably executed, it can at be&s;t only guard our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; but when by favour or ignorance ju&s;|tice pronounces a wrong verdict, it then attacks our lives, &s;ince in &s;uch a ca&s;e the whole commu|nity &s;uffers with the innocent victim; if therefore in order to &s;ecure the effects of one man, I &s;hould make a law which may take away the life of ano|ther, in &s;uch a ca&s;e to attain a &s;maller good, I am guilty of a greater evil, to &s;ecure &s;ociety in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a bauble, I render a real and valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion precarious. And indeed the experience of every age may &s;erve to vindicate the a&s;&s;ertion: No law could be more ju&s;t than that called <HI>le&s;ae Maje&s;tatis,</HI> when Rome was go|verned by Emperors. It was but rea&s;onable, that every con&s;piracy again&s;t the admini&s;tration &s;hould be detected and puni&s;hed; yet what terrible &s;laughters &s;ucceeded in con&s;equence of its enact|ing; pro&s;criptions, &s;tranglings, poi&s;onings, in al|mo&s;t every family of di&s;tinction, yet all done in a legal way, every criminal had his trial, and lo&s;t his life by a majority of witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>And &s;uch will ever be the ca&s;e, where puni&s;h|ments are numerous, and where a weak, vicious,
<PB N="66" REF="74">
but above all, where a mercenary magi&s;trate is concerned in their execution; &s;uch a man de&s;ires to &s;ee penal laws encrea&s;ed, &s;ince he too frequently has it in his power to turn them into in&s;truments of extortion; in &s;uch hands the more laws, the wider means, not of &s;atisfying ju&s;tice, but of &s;a|tiating avarice.</P>
<P>A mercenary magi&s;trate who is rewarded in pro|portion, not to his integrity, but to the number he convicts, mu&s;t be a per&s;on of the mo&s;t un|blemi&s;hed character, or he will lean on the &s;ide of cruelty; and when once the work of inju&s;tice is begun, it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell how far it will proceed; it is &s;aid of the Hyena that naturally it is no way ravenous, but when once it has ta&s;ted human fle&s;h, it becomes the mo&s;t voracious animal of the fore&s;t, and continues to per&s;ecute mankind ever after: A corrupt magi&s;trate may be con&s;idered as a human Hyena, he begins perhaps by a pri|vate &s;nap, he goes on to a mor&s;el among friends, he proceeds to a meal in public, from a meal he ad|vances to a &s;urfeit, and at la&s;t &s;ucks blood like a vampyre.</P>
<P>Not into &s;uch hands &s;hould the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice be entru&s;ted, but to tho&s;e who know how to reward as well as to puni&s;h; it was a fine &s;aying of Nangfu the emperor, who being told that his enemies had rai&s;ed an in&s;urrection in one of the di&s;tant provinces, Come then, my friends, &s;aid he, follow me, and I promi&s;e you that we &s;hall quickly de&s;troy them; he marched forward, and the rebels &s;ubmitted upon his approach. All now thought that he would take the mo&s;t &s;ignal revenge, but were &s;urprized to &s;ee the captives
<PB N="67" REF="75">
treated with mildne&s;s and humanity. How! cries his fir&s;t mini&s;ter, is this the manner in which you fulfil your promi&s;e? your royal word was given that your enemies &s;hould be de&s;troyed, and behold you have pardoned all, and even care&s;|&s;ed &s;ome! I promi&s;ed, replied the emperor, with a generous air, to <HI>de&s;troy</HI> my enemies, I have ful|filled my word, for &s;ee they are enemies no longer; I have made <HI>friends</HI> of them.</P>
<P>This, could it always &s;ucceed, were the true method of de&s;troying the enemies of a &s;tate; well it were if rewards and mercy alone could regulate the common-wealth; but &s;ince puni&s;hments are &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary, let them at lea&s;t be rendered terrible, by being executed but &s;eldom, and let ju&s;tice lift her &s;word rather to terrify than revenge.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXVIII.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE as yet given you but a &s;hort and im|perfect de&s;cription of the Ladies of England. Woman, my friend, is a &s;ubject not ea&s;ily under|&s;tood, even in China; what therefore can be ex|pected from my knowledge of the &s;ex in a coun|try where they are univer&s;ally allowed to be riddles, and I but a &s;tranger?</P>
<P>To confe&s;s a truth, I was afraid to begin the de&s;cription, le&s;t the &s;ex &s;hould undergo &s;ome new revolution before it was fini&s;hed; and my picture
<PB N="68" REF="76">
&s;hould thus become old before it could well be &s;aid to have ever been new. To-day they are lifted upon &s;tilts, to-morrow they lower their heels and rai&s;e their heads; their cloaths at one time are bloated out with whalebone, at pre&s;ent they have laid their hoops a&s;ide and are become as &s;lim as mermaids. All, all is in a &s;tate of continual fluctuation, from the Mandarine's wife, who rat|tles through the &s;treets in her chariot, to the hum|ble &s;emp&s;tre&s;s, who clatters over the pavement in iron-&s;hod pattens.</P>
<P>What chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hes the &s;ex at pre&s;ent is the train. As a Lady's quality or fa&s;hion was once determined here by the circumference of her hoop, both are now mea&s;ured by the length of her tail. Women of moderate fortunes are contented with tails moderately long; but ladies of true ta&s;te and di&s;tinction &s;et no bounds to their ambition in this particular. I am told the Lady Mayore&s;s, on days of ceremony, carries one longer than a bell-wether of Bantam, who&s;e tail you know is trund|led along in a wheel-barrow.</P>
<P>Sun of China, what contradictions do we find in this &s;trange world! not only the people of dif|ferent countries think in oppo&s;ition to each other, but the inhabitants of a &s;ingle i&s;land are often found incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves; would you believe it? this very people, my Fum, who are &s;o fond of &s;eeing their women with long tails, at the &s;ame time dock their hor&s;es to the very rump!!!</P>
<P>But you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s that I am no way di&s;plea&s;ed with a fa&s;hion which tends to encrea&s;e a demand for the commodities of the Ea&s;t, and is &s;o
<PB N="69" REF="77">
very beneficial to the country in which I was born. Nothing can be better calculated to encrea&s;e the price of &s;ilk than the pre&s;ent manner of dre&s;&s;ing. A lady's train is not bought but at &s;ome expence, and after it has &s;wept the public walks for a very few evenings, is fit to be worn no longer: more &s;ilk mu&s;t be bought in order to repair the breach, and &s;ome ladies of peculiar oeconomy are thus found to patch up their tails eight or ten times in a &s;ea&s;on. This unnece&s;&s;ary con&s;umption may in|troduce poverty here, but then we &s;hall be the richer for it in China.</P>
<P>The man in black, who is a profe&s;&s;ed enemy to this manner of ornamenting the tail, a&s;&s;ures me, there are numberle&s;s inconveniencies attend|ing it, and that a lady dre&s;&s;ed up to the fa&s;hion is as much a cripple as any in Nankin. But his chief indignation is levelled at tho&s;e who dre&s;s in this manner, without a proper fortune to &s;upport it. He a&s;&s;ures me, that he has known &s;ome, who would have a tail, though they wanted a petticoat, and others, who, without any other preten&s;ions, fan|cied they became ladies merely from the addition of three &s;uperfluous yards of ragged &s;ilk; I know a thrifty good woman, continues he, who thinking her&s;elf obliged to carry a train like her betters, never walks from home without the unea&s;y apprehen|&s;ions of wearing it out too &s;oon; every excur&s;ion &s;he makes gives her new anxiety, and her train is every bit as importunate, and wounds her peace as much as the bladder we &s;ometimes &s;ee tied to the tail of a cat.</P>
<P>Nay, he ventures to affirm, that a train may often bring a lady into the mo&s;t critical circum|&s;tances; for &s;hould a rude fellow, &s;ays he, offer
<PB N="70" REF="78">
to come up to ravi&s;h a ki&s;s, and the lady attempt to avoid it, in retiring &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily tread upon her train, and thus fall fairly upon her back, by which means every one knows,&mdash; her cloaths may be &s;poiled.</P>
<P>The ladies here make no &s;cruple to laugh at the &s;mallne&s;s of a Chine&s;e &s;lipper, but I fancy our wives at China would have a more real cau&s;e of laughter, could they but &s;ee the immoderate length of an European train. Head of Confucius, to view a human being crippling her&s;elf with a great unwieldy tail for our diver&s;ion; backward &s;he cannot go, forward &s;he mu&s;t move but &s;lowly, and if ever &s;he attempts to turn round, it mu&s;t be in a circle not &s;maller than that de&s;cribed by the wheeling crocodile, when it would face an a&s;&s;ailant. And yet to think that all this confers importance and maje&s;ty! to think that a lady acquires ad|ditional re&s;pect from fifteen yards of trailing taf|fety! I can't contain; ha, ha, ha; this is certainly a remnant of European barbarity, the female Tartar dre&s;&s;ed in &s;heep-&s;kins, is in far more conve|nient drapery. Their own writers have &s;ome|times inveigh'd again&s;t the ab&s;urdity of this fa&s;hi|on, but perhaps it has never been ridiculed &s;o well as upon the Italian theatre, where Pa&s;qua|rielo being engaged to attend on the counte&s;s of Fernambroco, having one of his hands employed in carrying her muff, and the other her lap-dog, he bears her train maje&s;tically along by &s;ticking it in the wai&s;tband of his breeches.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXIX.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>A Di&s;pute has for &s;ome time divided the philo|&s;ophers of Europe; it is debated, whether arts and &s;ciences are more &s;erviceable or preju|dicial to mankind. They, who maintain the cau&s;e of literature, endeavour to prove their u&s;e|fulne&s;s from the impo&s;&s;ibility of a large number of men &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in a &s;mall tract of country with|out them; from the plea&s;ure which attends the acqui&s;ition; and from the influence of knowledge in promoting practical morality.</P>
<P>They who maintain the oppo&s;ite opinion, di&s;|play the happine&s;s and innocence of tho&s;e un|cultivated nations who live without learning; urge the numerous vices which are to be found only in poli&s;hed &s;ociety, enlarge upon the oppre&s;&s;ion, the cruelty and the blood which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;hed, in order to cement civil &s;ociety, and in|&s;i&s;t upon the happy equality of conditions in a bar|barous &s;tate, preferable to the unnatural &s;ubordi|nation of a more refined con&s;titution.</P>
<P>This di&s;pute, which has already given &s;o much employment to &s;peculative indolence, has been managed with much ardour, and (not to &s;up|pre&s;s our &s;entiments) with but little &s;agacity. They who in&s;i&s;t that the &s;ciences are u&s;eful in <HI>refined</HI> &s;ociety are certainly right, and they who maintain that <HI>barbarous</HI> nations are more happy without them, are right al&s;o; but when one &s;ide for this rea&s;on attempts to prove them as univer&s;ally
<PB N="72" REF="80">
u&s;eful to the &s;olitary barbarian, as to the native of a crowded common-wealth; or when the other endeavours to bani&s;h them as prejudicial to all &s;ociety, even from populous &s;tates as well as from the inhabitants of the wilderne&s;s, they are both wrong; &s;ince that knowledge which makes the hap|pine&s;s of a refined European, would be a torment to the precarious tenant of an A&s;iatic wild.</P>
<P>Let me, to prove this, tran&s;port the imagina|tion for a moment to the mid&s;t of a fore&s;t in Si|beria. There we behold the inhabitant, poor in|deed, but equally fond of happine&s;s with the mo&s;t refined philo&s;opher of China. The earth lies un|cultivated and uninhabited for miles around him; his little family and he the &s;ole and un|di&s;puted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. In &s;uch circum&s;tances nature and rea&s;on will induce him to prefer a hunter's life to that of cultivating the earth. He will certainly adhere to that manner of living which is carried on at the &s;malle&s;t expence of labour, and that food which is mo&s;t agreeable to the appetite, he will prefer indolent though precarious luxury, to a laborious though permanent competence, and a knowledge of his own happine&s;s will deter|mine him to per&s;evere in native barbarity.</P>
<P>In like manner his happine&s;s will incline him to bind him&s;elf by no law: Laws are made in order to &s;ecure pre&s;ent property, but he is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of no property which he is afraid to lo&s;e, and de&s;ires no more than will be &s;ufficient to &s;u&s;|tain him; to enter into compacts with others, would be undergoing a voluntary obligation with|out the expectance of any reward. He and his countrymen are tenants, not rivals, in the &s;ame
<PB N="73" REF="81">
inexhau&s;tible fore&s;t; the encrea&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of one by no means dimini&s;hes the expectations ari&s;ing from equal a&s;&s;iduity in another; there are no need of laws therefore to repre&s;s ambition, where there can be no mi&s;chief attending its mo&s;t boundle&s;s gratifications.</P>
<P>Our &s;olitary Siberian will, in like manner, find the &s;ciences not only entirely u&s;ele&s;s in directing his practice, but di&s;gu&s;ting even in &s;peculation. In every contemplation our curio&s;ity mu&s;t be fir&s;t excited by the <HI>appearances</HI> of things, before our rea&s;on undergoes the fatigue of inve&s;tigating the <HI>cau&s;es.</HI> Some of tho&s;e appearances are pro|duced by experiment, others by minute enquiry; &s;ome ari&s;e from a knowledge of foreign climates, and others from an intimate &s;tudy of our own. But there are few objects in compari&s;on which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the inhabitant of a bar|barous country; the game he hunts, or the tran&s;ient cottage he builds, make up the chief objects of his concern; his curio&s;ity therefore mu&s;t be proportionably le&s;s; and if that is dimi|ni&s;hed, the rea&s;oning faculty will be dimini&s;hed in proportion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;en&s;ual enjoyment adds wings to curi|o&s;ity. We con&s;ider few objects with ardent atten|tion, but tho&s;e which have &s;ome connection with our wi&s;hes, our plea&s;ures, or our nece&s;&s;ities. A de&s;ire of enjoyment fir&s;t intere&s;ts our pa&s;&s;ions in the pur&s;uit, points out the object of inve&s;tigation, and rea&s;on then comments where &s;en&s;e has led the way. An encrea&s;e in the number of our enjoy|ments therefore nece&s;&s;arily produces an encrea&s;e
<PB N="74" REF="82">
of &s;cientific re&s;earch; but in countries where al|mo&s;t every enjoyment is wanting, rea&s;on there &s;eems de&s;titute of its great in&s;pirer, and &s;pecula|tion is the bu&s;ine&s;s of fools when it becomes its own reward.</P>
<P>The barbarous Siberian is too wi&s;e, therefore, to exhau&s;t his time in que&s;t of knowledge, which neither curio&s;ity prompts, nor plea&s;ure impells him to pur&s;ue. When told of the exact admea&s;ure|ment of a degree upon the equator at Quito, he feels no plea&s;ure in the account; when informed that &s;uch a di&s;covery tends to promote navigation and commerce, he finds him&s;elf no way intere&s;ted in either. A di&s;covery which &s;ome have pur&s;ued at the hazard of their lives, affects him with neither a&s;toni&s;hment nor plea&s;ure. He is &s;atisfied with thoroughly under&s;tanding the few objects which contribute to his own felicity, he knows the propere&s;t places where to lay the &s;nare for the &s;able, and di&s;cerns the value of furrs with more than European &s;agacity. More extended know|ledge would only &s;erve to render him unhappy, it might lend a ray to &s;hew him the mi&s;ery of his &s;ituation, but could not guide him in his efforts to avoid it. Ignorance is the happine&s;s of the poor.</P>
<P>The mi&s;ery of a being endowed with &s;entiments above its capacity of fruition, is mo&s;t admirably de&s;cribed in one of the fables of Locman the Indian morali&s;t. "An elephant that had been peculiarly &s;erviceable in fighting the battles of Wi&s;tnow, was ordered by the god to wi&s;h for whatever he thought proper, and the de&s;ire &s;hould be attended with immediate gratification. The elephant thanked his benefactor on bended knees,
<PB N="75" REF="83">
and de&s;ired to be endowed with the rea&s;on and the faculties of a man. Wi&s;tnow was &s;orry to hear the fooli&s;h reque&s;t, and endeavoured to di&s;|&s;uade him from his mi&s;placed ambition; but find|ing it to no purpo&s;e, gave him at la&s;t &s;uch a portion of wi&s;dom as could correct even the Zendave&s;ta of Zoroa&s;ter. The rea&s;oning elephant went away rejoicing in his new acqui&s;ition, and though his body &s;till retained its ancient form, he found his appetites and pa&s;&s;ions entirely altered. He fir&s;t con&s;idered that it would not only be more com|fortable, but al&s;o more becoming to wear cloaths; but unhappily he had no method of making them him&s;elf, nor had he the u&s;e of &s;peech to demand them from others, and this was the fir&s;t time he felt real anxiety. He &s;oon perceived how much more elegantly men were fed than he, therefore he began to loath his u&s;ual food and longed for tho&s;e delicacies which adorn the tables of princes; but here again he found it impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;ati&s;|fied; for though he could ea&s;ily obtain fle&s;h, yet he &s;ound it impo&s;&s;ible to dre&s;s it in any degree of perfection. In &s;hort, every plea&s;ure that contri|buted to the felicity of mankind, &s;erved only to render him more mi&s;erable., as he found him&s;elf utterly deprived of the power of enjoyment. In this manner he led a repining, di&s;contented life, dete&s;ting him&s;elf and di&s;plea&s;ed with his ill judged ambition, till at la&s;t his benefactor Wi&s;tnow, tak|ing compa&s;&s;ion on his forlorn &s;ituation, re&s;tored him to the ignorance and the happine&s;s which he was originally formed to enjoy."</P>

to render them more mi&s;erable than even nature de&s;igned they &s;hould be. A life of &s;implicity is be&s;t fitted to a &s;tate of &s;olitude.</P>
<P>The great law-giver of Ru&s;&s;ia attempted to improve the de&s;olate inhabitants of Siberia, by &s;ending among them &s;ome of the polite&s;t men of Europe. The con&s;equence has &s;hewn, that the country was as yet unfit to receive them; they langui&s;hed for a time with a &s;ort of exotic malady, every day degenerated from them&s;elves, and at la&s;t, in&s;tead of rendering the country more polite, they conformed to the &s;oil, and put on barbarity.</P>
<P>No, my friend, in order to make the &s;ciences u&s;e|ful in any country, it mu&s;t fir&s;t become populous; the inhabitant mu&s;t go through the different &s;tages of hunter, &s;hepherd&punc; and hu&s;bandman: then when property becomes valuable, and con&s;equently gives cau&s;e for inju&s;tice, then when laws are appointed to repre&s;s injury, and &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, when men, by the &s;anction of tho&s;e laws, become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uperfluity, when luxury is thus introduced and demands its continual &s;upply then it is that the &s;ci|ences become nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful; the &s;tate then cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them; they mu&s;t then be introduced, at once to teach men to draw the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible quantity of plea&s;ure from circum|&s;cribed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and to re&s;train them within the bounds of moderate enjoyment.</P>
<P>The &s;ciences are not the cau&s;e of luxury, but its con&s;equence, and this de&s;troyer thus brings with it an antidote which re&s;i&s;ts the virulence of its own poi&s;on. By a&s;&s;erting that luxury intro|duces the &s;ciences, we a&s;&s;ert a truth; but if with tho&s;e, who reject the utility of learning&punc; we

a&s;&s;ert that the &s;ciences al&s;o introduce luxury, we &s;hall be at once fal&s;e, ab&s;urd, and ridiculous.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXX.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi to Hingpo, by the way of Mo&s;cow.</HEAD>
<P>YOU are now arrived at an age, my &s;on, when plea&s;ure di&s;&s;uades from application, but rob not by pre&s;ent gratification all the &s;ucceeding pe|riod of life of its happine&s;s Sacrifice a little plea&s;ure at fir&s;t to the expectance of greater. The &s;tudy of a very few years will make the re&s;t of life compleatly ea&s;y.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of continuing the &s;ubject my&s;elf, take the following in&s;tructions borrowed from a modern philo&s;opher of China<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A tran&s;lation of this pa&s;&s;age may al&s;o be &s;een in Du Halde, Vol. II. Fol. p. 47, and 58. This extract will at lea&s;t &s;erve to &s;hew that fondne&s;s for humour which appears in the writings of the Chine&s;e.</NOTE>. "He who has begun his fortune by &s;tudy will certainly confirm it by per&s;everance. The love of books damps the pa&s;&s;ion for plea&s;ure, and when this pa&s;&s;ion is once extingui&s;hed, life is then cheaply &s;upported; thus a man being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more than he wants, can never be &s;ubject to great di&s;appoint|ments, and avoids all tho&s;e meanne&s;&s;es which in|digence &s;ometimes unavoidably produces.</P>
<P>"There is un&s;peakable plea&s;ure attending the life of a voluntary &s;tudent. The fir&s;t time I read
<PB N="78" REF="86">
an excellent book, it is to me ju&s;t as if I had gained a new friend. When I read over a book I have peru&s;ed before, it re&s;embles the meeting with an old one. We ought to lay hold of every incident in life for improvement, the trifling as well as the important. It is not one diamond alone which gives lu&s;tre to another, a common coar&s;e &s;tone is al&s;o employed for that purpo&s;e. Thus I ought to draw advantage from the in&s;ults and con|tempt I meet with from a worthle&s;s fellow. His brutality ought to induce me to &s;elf-examination, and correct every blemi&s;h that may have given ri&s;e to his calumny.</P>
<P>"Yet with all the plea&s;ures and profits which are generally produced by learning, parents often find it difficult to induce their children to &s;tudy. They often &s;eem dragged to what wears the appearance of application. Thus being dilatory in the begin|ning, all future hopes of eminence are entirely cut off. If they find them&s;elves obliged to write two lines more polite than ordinary, their pencil then &s;eems as heavy as a mill-&s;tone, and they &s;pend ten years in turning two or three periods with propriety.</P>
<P>"The&s;e per&s;ons are mo&s;t at a lo&s;s when a banquet is almo&s;t over; the plate and the dice go round, that the number of little ver&s;es which each is obliged to repeat may be determined by chance. The booby, when it comes to his turn, appears quite &s;tupid and in&s;en&s;ible. The company divert them&s;elves with his confu&s;ion; and &s;neers, winks, and whi&s;pers are circulated at his expence. As for him, he opens a pair of large heavy eyes, &s;tares at all about him, and even offers to join in the laugh,
<PB N="79" REF="87">
without ever con&s;idering him&s;elf as the burthen of all their good humour.</P>
<P>"But it is of no importance to read much, except you be regular in your reading. If it be interrupted for any con&s;iderable time, it can never be attended with proper improvement. There are &s;ome who &s;tudy for one day with inten&s;e application, and re|po&s;e them&s;elves for ten days after. But wi&s;dom is a coquet, and mu&s;t be courted with unabating a&s;&s;iduity.</P>
<P>"It was a &s;aying of the ancients, that a man never opens a book without reaping &s;ome advan|tage by it. I &s;ay with them, that every book can &s;erve to make us more expert, except romances, and the&s;e are no better than in&s;truments of de|bauchery. They are dangerous fictions, where love is the ruling pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"The mo&s;t indecent &s;trokes there pa&s;s for turns of wit, intrigue and criminal liberties for gallantry and politene&s;s. A&s;&s;ignations, and even villainy, are put in &s;uch &s;trong lights, as may in&s;pire, even grown men, with the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ion; how much more therefore ought the youth of either &s;ex to dread them, who&s;e rea&s;on is &s;o weak, and who&s;e hearts are &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of pa&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>"To &s;lip in by a back-door, or leap a wall, are accompli&s;hments that when hand&s;omely &s;et off en|chant a young heart. It is true the plot is com|monly wound up by a marriage, concluded with the con&s;ent of parents, and adju&s;ted by every cere|mony pre&s;cribed by law. But as in the body of the work there are many pa&s;&s;ages that offend good
<PB N="80" REF="88">
morals, overthrow laudable cu&s;toms, violate the laws, and de&s;troy the duties mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to &s;o|ciety, virtue is thereby expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t dan|gerous attacks.</P>
<P>"But, &s;ay &s;ome, the authors of the&s;e romances have nothing in view, but to repre&s;ent vice puni&s;h|ed and virtue rewarded. Granted. But will the greater number of readers take notice of the&s;e puni&s;hments and rewards? Are not their minds carried to &s;omething el&s;e? Can it be imagined that the art with which the author in&s;pires the love of virtue, can overcome that crowd of thoughts which &s;way them to licentiou&s;ne&s;s? To be able to inculcate virtue by &s;o leaky a vehicle, the author mu&s;t be a philo&s;opher of the fir&s;t rank. But in our age we can find but few fir&s;t rate philo&s;o|phers.</P>
<P>"Avoid &s;uch performances where vice a&s;&s;umes the face of virtue; &s;eek wi&s;dom and knowledge without ever thinking you have found them. A man is wi&s;e, while he continues in the pur&s;uit of wi&s;dom; but when he once fancies that he has found the object of his enquiry, he then becomes a fool. Learn to pur&s;ue virtue from the man that is blind, who never makes a &s;tep without fir&s;t ex|amining the ground with his &s;taff.</P>
<P>"The world is like a va&s;t &s;ea, mankind like a ve&s;&s;el &s;ailing on its tempe&s;tuous bo&s;om. Our pru|dence is its &s;ails, the &s;ciences &s;erve us for oars, good or bad fortune are the favourable or con|trary winds, and judgment is the rudder; with|out this la&s;t the ve&s;&s;el is to&s;&s;ed by every billow, and will find &s;hipwreck in every breeze.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXI.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, fir&s;t pre&s;ident of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>I Fancy the character of a poet is in every coun|try the &s;ame, fond of enjoying the pre&s;ent, carele&s;s of the future, his conver&s;ation that of a man of &s;en&s;e, his actions tho&s;e of a fool! of for|titude able to &s;tand unmoved at the bur&s;ting of an earthquake, yet of &s;en&s;ibility to be affected by the breaking of a tea-cup; &s;uch is his character, which con&s;idered in every light is the very oppo&s;ite of that which leads to riches.</P>
<P>The poets of the we&s;t are as remarkable for their indigence as their genius, and yet among the numerous ho&s;pitals de&s;igned to relieve the poor, I have heard of but one erected for the be|nefit of decayed authors. This was founded by pope Urban VIII. and called the retreat of the incurables, intimating, that it was equally impo&s;|&s;ible to reclaim the patients, who &s;ued for reception, from poverty, or from poetry. To be &s;incere, were I to &s;end you an account of the lives of the we&s;tern poets, either antient or modern, I fancy
<PB N="82" REF="90">
you would think me employed in collecting ma|terials for an hi&s;tory of human wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Homer is the fir&s;t poet and beggar of note among the antients; he was blind, and &s;ung his ballads about the &s;treets; but it is ob&s;erved, that his mouth was more frequently filled with ver&s;es than with bread. Plautus the comic poet was better off; he had two trades, he was a poet for his diver&s;ion, and helped to turn a mill in order to gain a livelihood. Terence was a &s;lave, and Boe|thius died in a jail.</P>
<P>Among the Italians, Paulo Burghe&s;e, almo&s;t as good a poet as Ta&s;&s;o, knew fourteen different trades, and yet died becau&s;e he could get em|ployment in none. Ta&s;&s;o him&s;elf, who had the mo&s;t amiable character of all poets, has often been obliged to borrow a crown from &s;ome friend, in order to pay for a month's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; he has left us a pretty &s;onnet, addre&s;&s;ed to his cat, in which he begs the light of her eyes to write by, being too poor to afford him&s;elf a candle. But Bentivoglio, poor Bentivoglio! chiefly demands our pity. His comedies will la&s;t with the Ita|lian language; he di&s;&s;ipated a noble fortune in acts of charity and benevolence; but falling into mi&s;ery in his old age, was refu&s;ed to be admitted into an ho&s;pital which he him&s;elf had erected.</P>
<P>In Spain it is &s;aid, the great Cervantes died of hunger; and it is certain, that the famous Camoens ended his days in an ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>If we turn to France, we &s;hall there find even &s;tronger in&s;tances of the ingratitude of the public. Vaugelas, one of the polite&s;t writers, and one of the
<PB N="83" REF="91">
hone&s;te&s;t men of his time, was &s;irnamed the Owl, from his being obliged to keep within all day, and venture out only by night, through fear of his cre|ditors. His la&s;t will is very remarkable; after having bequeathed all his worldly &s;ub&s;tance to the di&s;charg|ing his debts, he goes on thus; But as there &s;till may remain &s;ome creditors unpaid, even after all that I have &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed of, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, it is my la&s;t will, that my body &s;hould be &s;old to the &s;urgeons to the be&s;t advantage, and that the purcha&s;e &s;hould go to the di&s;charging tho&s;e debts which I owe to &s;ociety; &s;o that if I could not, while living, at lea&s;t when dead, I may be u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;ander was one of the greate&s;t geniu&s;es of his time, yet all his merit could not procure him a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Being by degrees driven into an hatred of all mankind from the little pity he found among&s;t them, he even ventured at la&s;t un|gratefully to impute his calamities to providence. In his la&s;t agonies, when the prie&s;t entreated him to rely on the ju&s;tice of heaven, and a&s;k mercy from him that made him; <HI>If God,</HI> replies he, <HI>has &s;hewn me no ju&s;tice here, what rea&s;on have I to expect any from him hereafter?</HI> But being an&s;wered, that a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ju&s;tice was no argument that &s;hould induce us to doubt of its reality; let me entreat you, continued his confe&s;&s;or, by all that is dear, to be reconciled to God, your father, your mak|er, and friend. <HI>No,</HI> replied the exa&s;perated wretch, <HI>you know the manner in which he left me to live</HI>; (and pointing to the &s;traw on which he was &s;tretched) <HI>and you &s;ee the manner in which he leaves me to die!</HI></P>
<P>But the &s;ufferings of the poet in other countries is nothing when compared to his di&s;tre&s;&s;es here, the names of Spencer and Otway, Butler and Dryden,
<PB N="84" REF="92">
are every day mentioned as a national reproach, &s;ome of them lived in a &s;tate of precarious indi|gence, and others literally died of hunger.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent the few poets of England no longer depend on the Great for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, they have now no other patrons but the public, and the pub|lic, collectively con&s;idered, is a good and a gene|rous ma&s;ter. It is indeed, too frequently mi&s;taken as to the merits of every candidate for favour; but to make amends, it is never mi&s;taken long. A performance indeed may be forced for a time into reputation, but de&s;titute of real merit it &s;oon &s;inks; time, the touch&s;tone of what is truly valu|able, will &s;oon di&s;cover the fraud, and an author &s;hould never arrogate to him&s;elf any &s;hare of &s;uc|ce&s;s, till his works have been read at lea&s;t ten years with &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>A man of letters at pre&s;ent, who&s;e works are valuable, is perfectly &s;en&s;ible of their value. Every polite member of the community by buying what he writes, contributes to reward him. The ridicule therefore of living in a garret, might have been wit in the la&s;t age, but continues &s;uch no longer, becau&s;e no longer true. A writer of real merit now may ea&s;ily be rich if his heart be &s;et only on fortune: and for tho&s;e who have no merit, it is but fit that &s;uch &s;hould remain in merited ob|&s;curity. He may now refu&s;e an invitation to dinner, without fearing to incur his patron's di&s;plea&s;ure, or to &s;tarve by remaining at home. He may now venture to appear in company with ju&s;t &s;uch cloaths as other men generally wear, and talk even to princes, with all the con&s;cious &s;uperiority of wi&s;dom. Though he cannot boa&s;t of fortune here, yet he can bravely a&s;&s;ert the dignity of inde|pendence. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXII.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE intere&s;ted my&s;elf &s;o long in all the concerns of this people, that I am almo&s;t be|come an Engli&s;hman; I now begin to read with plea&s;ure of their taking towns or gaining battles, and &s;ecretly wi&s;h di&s;appointment to all the enemies of Britain. Yet &s;till my regard to mankind fills me with concern for their contentions. I could wi&s;h to &s;ee the di&s;turbances of Europe once more ami|cably adju&s;ted: I am an enemy to nothing in this good world but war; I hate fighting between rival &s;tates; I hate it between man and man; I hare fighting even between women!</P>
<P>I already informed you, that while Europe was at variance, we were al&s;o threatened from the &s;tage with an irreconcileable oppo&s;ition, and that our &s;inging women were re&s;olved to &s;ing at each other to the end of the &s;ea&s;on. O my friend, tho&s;e fears were ju&s;t. They are nor only determined to &s;ing at each other to the end of the &s;ea&s;on, but what is wor&s;e, to &s;ing the &s;ame &s;ong, and what is &s;till more in&s;upportable, to make us pay for hearing.</P>
<P>If they be for war, for my part I &s;hould advi&s;e them to have a public congre&s;s, and there fairly &s;quall at each other. What &s;ignifies &s;ounding the trumpet of defiance at a di&s;tance, and calling in the town to fight their battles. I would have them come boldly into one of the mo&s;t open and frequented &s;treets, face to face, and there try their &s;till in quavering.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="94">However this may be, re&s;olved I am that they &s;hall not touch one &s;ingle piece of &s;ilver more of mine. Though I have ears for mu&s;ic, thanks to heaven, they are not altogether a&s;&s;es ears. What! Polly and the Pick-pocket to-night, Polly and the Pick-pocket to-morrow night, and Polly and the Pick-pocket again; I want patience. I'll hear no more. My &s;oul is out of tune, all jarring di&s;|cord, and confu&s;ion. Re&s;t, re&s;t, ye three dear clinking &s;hillings in my pocket's bottom; the mu|&s;ic you make is more harmonious to my &s;pirit, than cat-gut, ro&s;in, or all the nightingales that ever chirruped in petticoats.</P>
<P>But what rai&s;es my indignation to the greate&s;t degree, is that this piping does not only pe&s;ter me on the &s;tage, but is my puni&s;hment in private conver&s;ation. What is it to me, whether the <HI>fine pipe</HI> of one, or the <HI>great manner</HI> of the other be pre|ferable? what care I if one has a better top, or the other a nobler bottom? how am I concerned if one &s;ings from the &s;tomach, or the other &s;ings with a &s;nap? yet paltry as the&s;e matters are, they make a &s;ubject of debate wherever I go, and this mu&s;ical di&s;pute, e&s;pecially among the fair &s;ex, almo&s;t always ends in a very unmu&s;ical altercation.</P>
<P>Sure the &s;pirit of contention is mixed into the very con&s;titution of the people; divi&s;ions among the inhabitants of other countries ari&s;e only from their higher concerns, but &s;ubjects the mo&s;t con|temptible are made an affair of party here, the &s;pirit is carried even into their amu&s;ements. The very ladies, who&s;e duty &s;hould &s;eem to allay the impetuo&s;ity of the oppo&s;ite &s;ex, become them|&s;elves party champions, engage in the thicke&s;t of
<PB N="87" REF="95">
the fight, &s;cold at each other, and &s;hew their courage, even at the expence of their lovers and their beauty.</P>
<P>There are even a numerous &s;et of poets who help to keep up the contention, and write for the &s;tage. Mi&s;take me not, I don't mean pieces to be acted upon it, but panegyrical ver&s;es on the per|formers, for that is the mo&s;t univer&s;al method of writing for the &s;tage at pre&s;ent. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tage-poet therefore to watch the appearance of every new player at his own hou&s;e, and &s;o come out next day with a flaunting copy of news|paper ver&s;es. In the&s;e nature and the actor may be &s;et to run races, the player always coming off victorious; or nature may mi&s;take him for her|&s;elf; or old Shake&s;pear may put on his winding-&s;heet and pay him a vi&s;it; or the tuneful nine may &s;trike up their harps in his prai&s;e; or &s;hould it happen to be an actre&s;s, Venus, the beauteous queen of love, and the naked graces, are ever in wait|ing: the lady mu&s;t be her&s;elf a godde&s;s bred and born; &s;he mu&s;t&mdash;but you &s;hall have a &s;pecimen of one of the&s;e poems, which may convey a more preci&s;e idea.</P>

<P>And yet think not, my friend, that I have any particular animo&s;ity again&s;t the champions who are at the head of the pre&s;ent commotion; on the contrary, I could find plea&s;ure in their mu&s;ic, if &s;erved up at proper intervals; if I heard it only on proper occa&s;ions, and not about it wherever I go. In fact, I could patronize them both; and as an in&s;tance of my conde&s;cen&s;ion in this par|ticular, they may come and give me a &s;ong at my lodgings, on any evening when I'm at lei&s;ure, provided they keep a becoming di&s;tance, and &s;tand, while they continue to entertain me, with decent humility at the door.</P>
<P>You perceive I have not read the &s;eventeen books of Chine&s;e ceremonies to no purpo&s;e. I know the proper &s;hare of re&s;pect due to every rank in &s;ociety. Stage-players, fire eaters, &s;inging women, dancing-dogs, wild bea&s;ts, and wire-walkers, as their efforts are exerted for our amu&s;e|ment, ought not <HI>entirely</HI> to be de&s;pi&s;ed. The laws of every country &s;hould allow them to play their tricks at lea&s;t with impunity. They &s;hould not be branded with the ignominious appellation of vagabonds; at lea&s;t they de&s;erve a rank in &s;ociety equal to the my&s;tery of barbers, or undertakers, and could my influence extend &s;o far, they &s;hould
<PB N="89" REF="97">
be allowed to earn even forty or fifty pounds a year, if eminent in their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible however that you will cen&s;ure me of profu&s;ion in this re&s;pect, bred up as you are in the narrow prejudices of ea&s;tern frugality. You will undoubtedly a&s;&s;ert, that &s;uch a &s;tipend is too great for &s;o u&s;ele&s;s an employment. Yet how will your &s;urprize encrea&s;e, when told, that though the law holds them as vagabonds, many of them earn more than a thou&s;and a year. You are amazed. There is cau&s;e for amazement. A vagabond with a thou&s;and a year is indeed a cu|rio&s;ity in nature; a wonder far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the flying fi&s;h, petrified crab, or travelling lob&s;ter. However, from my great love to the profe&s;&s;ion, I would willingly have them dive&s;ted of part of their contempt, and part of their finery; the law &s;hould kindly take them under the wing of pro|tection, fix them into a corporation, like that of the barbers, and abridge their ignominy and their pen&s;ions. As to their abilities in other re&s;pects, I would leave that entirely to the public, who are certainly in this ca&s;e the propere&s;t judges&mdash;&mdash; whether they de&s;pi&s;e them or no.</P>
<P>Yes, my <HI>Fum,</HI> I would abridge their pen&s;ions.

<PB N="90" REF="98">
and, in&s;tead of being permitted to keep four mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, in con&s;cience they &s;hould be contented only with two.</P>

<P>I &s;hall conclude my letter with the &s;en&s;ible ad|monition of <HI>M&ecirc;</HI> the philo&s;opher. "You love harmony, &s;ays he, and are charmed with mu&s;ic.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXIII.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the places of amu&s;ement where gentlemen and ladies are entertained, I have not been yet to vi&s;it Newmarket. This, I am told, is a large field; where upon certain occa&s;ions three or four
<PB N="91" REF="99">
hor&s;es are brought together, then &s;et a running, and that hor&s;e which runs fa&s;te&s;t wins the wager.</P>
<P>This is reckoned a very polite and fa&s;hionable amu&s;ement here, much more followed by the no|bility than partridge fighting at Java, or paper kites in Madaga&s;car; &s;everal of the great here, I am told, under&s;tand as much of farriery as their grooms; and a hor&s;e, with any &s;hare of merit, can never want a patron among the nobility.</P>
<P>We have a de&s;cription of this entertainment almo&s;t every day in &s;ome of the gazettes, as for in&s;tance: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"On &s;uch a day the Give and Take Plate was run for between his Grace's Crab, his Lord&s;hip's Periwinkle, and 'Squire Smackem's Slamerkin. All rode their own hor&s;es. There was the greate&s;t concour&s;e of nobility that has been known here for &s;everal &s;ea&s;ons. The odds were in favour of Crab in the beginning, but Slamer|kin, after the fir&s;t heat, &s;eemed to have the match hollow; however, it was &s;oon &s;een, that Periwinkle improved in wind, which, at la&s;t, turned out accordingly; Crab was run to a &s;tand &s;till, Slamerkin was knocked up, and Periwinkle was brought in with univer&s;al applau&s;e."</Q> Thus you &s;ee Periwinkle received univer&s;al applau&s;e, and no doubt his Lord&s;hip came in for &s;ome &s;hare of that prai&s;e which was &s;o liberally be&s;towed upon Periwinkle. Sun of China! how glorious mu&s;t the Senator appear in his cap and leather breeches, his whip cro&s;&s;ed in his mouth, and thus coming to the goal among&s;t the &s;houts of grooms, jockies, pimps, &s;table-bred Dukes, and degraded Generals!</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="100">From the de&s;cription of this princely amu&s;ement, now tran&s;cribed, and from the great veneration I have for the characters of its principal promoters, I make no doubt but I &s;hall look upon an hor&s;e|race with becoming reverence, predi&s;po&s;ed as I am by a &s;imilar amu&s;ement, of which I have lately been a &s;pectator; for ju&s;t now I happened to have an opportunity of being pre&s;ent at a Cart-race.</P>
<P>Whether this contention between three carts of different pari&s;hes was promoted by a &s;ub&s;cription among the nobility, or whether the grand jury, in council a&s;&s;embled, had gloriou&s;ly combined to en|courage plau&s;tral merit, I cannot take upon me to determine; but certain it is, the whole was con|ducted with the utmo&s;t regularity and decorum, and the company, which made a brilliant appear|ance, were univer&s;ally of opinion, that the &s;port was high, the running fine, and the riders influ|enced by no bribe.</P>
<P>It was run on the road from London to a vil|lage called Brentford, between a turnip cart, a du&s;t cart, and a dung cart; each of the owners conde&s;cending to mount and be his own driver. The odds at &s;tarting were <HI>du&s;t</HI> again&s;t <HI>dung</HI> five to four; but after half a miles going, the knowing ones found them&s;elves all on the wrong &s;ide, and it was <HI>turnip</HI> again&s;t the field, bra&s;s to &s;ilver.</P>
<P>Soon however the conte&s;t became more doubt|ful; Turnip indeed kept the way, but it was per|ceived that Dung had better bottom. The road re-ecchoed with the &s;houts of the &s;pectators; Dung again&s;t Turnip; Turnip again&s;t Dung, was now the univer&s;al cry; neck and neck; one rode light|er,
<PB N="93" REF="101">
but the other had more judgment. I could not but particularly ob&s;erve the ardour with which the fair &s;ex e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the different rid|ers on this occa&s;ion; one was charmed with the unwa&s;hed beauties of Dung; another was captivat|ed with the patibulary a&s;pect of Turnip: while in the mean time unfortunate gloomy Du&s;t, who came whipping behind, was cheared by the encou|ragements of &s;ome, and pity of all.</P>
<P>The contention now continued for &s;ome time, without a po&s;&s;ibility of determining to whom vic|tory de&s;igned the prize. The winning po&s;t ap|peared in view, and he who drove the turnip cart a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf of &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;ucce&s;sful he might have been, had his hor&s;e been as ambitious as he; but upon approaching a turn from the road, which led homewards, the hor&s;e fairly &s;tood &s;till, and refu&s;ed to move a foot farther. The dung cart had &s;carce time to enjoy this temporary triumph, when it was pitched headlong into a ditch by the way &s;ide, and the rider left to wallow in congenial mud. Du&s;t in the mean time &s;oon came up, and not being far from the po&s;t, came in amid&s;t the &s;houts and acclamations of all the &s;pectators, and greatly care&s;&s;ed by all the quality of Brentford. Fortune was kind only to one, who ought to have been favourable to all; each had peculiar merit, each laboured hard to earn the prize, and each richly de&s;erved the cart he drove.</P>
<P>I do not know whether this de&s;cription may not have anticipated that which I intended giving of Newmarket. I am told there is little el&s;e to be &s;een even there. There may be &s;ome minute dif|ferences in the dre&s;s of the &s;pectators, but none at
<PB N="94" REF="102">
all in their under&s;tandings; the quality of Brent|ford are as remarkable for politene&s;s and delicacy, as the breeders of Newmarket. The quality of Brentford drive their own carts, and the honour|able fraternity of Newmarket ride their own hor&s;es. In &s;hort, the matches in one place are as rational as tho&s;e in the other; and it is more than proba|ble, that turnips, du&s;t, and dung, are all that can be found to furni&s;h out de&s;cription in either.</P>
<P>Forgive me, my friend, but a per&s;on like me, bred up in a philo&s;ophic &s;eclu&s;ion, is apt to regard, perhaps with too much a&s;perity, tho&s;e occurrences which &s;ink man below his &s;tation in nature, and dimini&s;h the intrin&s;ic value of humanity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXIV.</HI> From Fum Hoam to Lien Chi Altangi.</HEAD>
<P>YOU tell me the people of Europe are wi&s;e; but where lies their wi&s;dom? You &s;ay they are valiant too; yet I have &s;ome rea&s;ons to doubt of their valour. They are engaged in war among each other, yet apply to the Ru&s;&s;ians, their neigh|bours and ours, for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Cultivating &s;uch an alliance argues at once imprudence and timidity. All &s;ub&s;idies paid for &s;uch an aid is &s;trengthening the Ru&s;&s;ians, already too powerful, and weakening the employers, already exhau&s;ted by inte&s;tine com|motions.</P>
<P>I cannot avoid beholding the Ru&s;&s;ian empire as the natural enemy of the more we&s;tern parts of
<PB N="95" REF="103">
Europe; as an enemy already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great &s;trength, and, from the nature of the government, every day threatening to become more powerful. This exten&s;ive empire, which, both in Europe and A&s;ia, occupies almo&s;t a third of the old world, was, about two centuries ago, divided into &s;eparate kingdoms and dukedoms, and from &s;uch a divi&s;ion con&s;equently feeble. Since the times, however, of Johan Ba&s;ilides, it has encrea&s;ed in &s;trength and extent; and tho&s;e untrodden fore&s;ts, tho&s;e innumerable &s;avage animals which formerly covered the face of the country, are now removed, and colonies of mankind planted in their room. A kingdom thus enjoying peace internally, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an unbounded extent of dominion, and learning the military art at the expence of others abroad, mu&s;t every day grow more powerful; and it is probable, we &s;hall hear Ru&s;&s;ia, in future times, as formerly, called the Officina Gentium.</P>
<P>It was long the wi&s;h of Peter, their great mo|narch, to have a fort in &s;ome of the we&s;tern parts of Europe; many of his &s;chemes and treaties were directed to this end, but happily for Europe he failed in them all. A fort in the power of this people would be like the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a flood-gate; and whenever ambition, intere&s;t, or nece&s;&s;ity prompt|ed, they might then be able to deluge the whole we&s;tern world with a barbarous inundation.</P>
<P>Believe me, my friend, I cannot &s;ufficiently con|temn the politics of Europe, who thus make this powerful people arbitrators in their quarrel. The Ru&s;&s;ians are now at that period between re|finement and barbarity, which &s;eems mo&s;t adapted to military atchievement; and if once they happen
<PB N="96" REF="104">
to get footing in the we&s;tern parts of Europe, it is not the feeble efforts of the &s;ons of effeminacy and di&s;&s;ention, that can &s;erve to remove them. The fertile valley and &s;oft climate will ever be &s;uf|ficient inducements to draw whole myriads from their native de&s;arts, the trackle&s;s wild, or &s;nowy mountain.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory, experience, rea&s;on, nature, expand the book of wi&s;dom before the eyes of mankind, but they will not read. We have &s;een with terror a winged phalanx of fami&s;hed locu&s;ts each &s;ingly contemptible, but from multitude become hideous, cover, like clouds, the face of day, and threaten the whole world with ruin. We have &s;een them &s;ettling on the fertile plains of India and Egypt, de&s;troying in an in&s;tant the labours and the hopes of nations; &s;paring neither the fruit of the earth nor the verdure of the fields, and changing into a frightful de&s;ert land&s;capes of once luxuriant beau|ty. We have &s;een myriads of ants i&s;&s;uing together from the &s;outhern de&s;ert, like a torrent who&s;e &s;ource was inexhau&s;tible, &s;ucceeding each other without end, and renewing their de&s;troyed forces, with unwearied per&s;everance, bringing de&s;ola|tion wherever they came, bani&s;hing men and ani|mals, and, when de&s;titute of all &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, in heaps infecting the wilderne&s;s which they had made! Like the&s;e have been the migrations of men. When as yet &s;avage, and almo&s;t re&s;embling their brute partners in the fore&s;t, &s;ubject like them only to the in&s;tincts of nature, and directed by hunger alone in the choice of an abode, how have we &s;een whole armies &s;tarting wild at once from their fore&s;ts and their dens; Goths, Huns, Van|dals, Saracens, Turks, Tartars, myriads of men,

animals in human form, without country, without name, without laws, out-powering by numbers all oppo&s;ition, ravaging cities, overturning empires. and, after having de&s;troyed whole nations, and &s;pread exten&s;ive de&s;olation, how have we &s;een them &s;ink oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome new enemy, more barba|rous and even more unknown than they!</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXV.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, fir&s;t pre&s;ident of the Ceremonial Academy, at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>AS the in&s;truction of the fair &s;ex in this country is entirely committed to the care of foreigners, as their language-ma&s;ters, mu&s;ic-ma&s;ters, hair-friz|zers, and governe&s;&s;es, are all from abroad, I had &s;ome intentions of opening a female academy my|&s;elf, and made no doubt, as I was quite a foreign|er, of meeting a favourable reception.</P>
<P>In this I intended to in&s;truct the ladies in all the conjugal my&s;teries; wives &s;hould be taught the art of managing hu&s;bands, and maids the &s;kill of pro|perly chu&s;ing them; I would teach a wife how far &s;he might venture to be &s;ick without giving di&s;gu&s;t, &s;he &s;hould be acquainted with the great benefits of the cholic in the &s;tomach, and all the thorough-bred in&s;olence of fa&s;hion; maids &s;hould learn the &s;ecret of nicely di&s;tingui&s;hing every com|petitor; they &s;hould be able to know the differ|ence between a pedant and a &s;cholar, a citizen and a prig, a &s;quire and his hor&s;e, a beau and his
<PB N="98" REF="106">
monkey; but chiefly they &s;hould be taught the art of managing their &s;miles, from the contemptuous &s;imper to the long laborious laugh.</P>
<P>But I have di&s;continued the project; for what would &s;ignify teaching ladies the manner of go|verning or chu&s;ing hu&s;bands, when marriage is at pre&s;ent &s;o much out of fa&s;hion, that a lady is very well off, who can get any hu&s;band at all. Celi|bacy now prevails in every rank of life, the &s;treets are crouded with old bachelors, and the hou&s;es with ladies who have refu&s;ed good offers, and are never likely to receive any for the future.</P>
<P>The only advice, therefore, I could give the fair &s;ex, as things &s;tand at pre&s;ent, is to get hu&s;bands as fa&s;t as they can. There is certainly nothing in the whole creation, not even Babylon in ruins, more truly deplorable than a lady in the virgin bloom of &s;ixty-three, or a battered unmarried beau, who &s;quibs about from place to place, &s;hewing his pig-tail wig and his ears. The one appears to my imagination in the form of a double night|cap, or a roll of pomatum, the other in the &s;hape of an electuary, or a box of pills.</P>
<P>I would once more therefore advi&s;e the ladies to get hu&s;bands. I would de&s;ire them not to di&s;card an old lover without very &s;ufficient rea&s;ons, nor treat the new with ill-nature till they know him fal&s;e; let not prudes alledge the fal&s;ene&s;s of the &s;ex, coquets the plea&s;ures of long court&s;hip, or parents, the nece&s;&s;ary preliminaries of penny for penny. I have rea&s;ons that would &s;ilence even a ca&s;ui&s;t in this particular. In the fir&s;t place, therefore, I divide the &s;ubject into fifteen heads,
<PB N="99" REF="107">
and then <HI>&s;ic argumentor</HI>&mdash;but not to give you and my&s;elf the &s;pleen, be contented at pre&s;ent with an Indian tale.</P>
<P>In a winding of the river Amidar, ju&s;t before it falls into the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, there lies an i&s;land un|frequented by the inhabitants of the Continent. In this &s;eclu&s;ion, ble&s;t with all that wild unculti|vated nature could be&s;tow, lived a prince&s;s and her two daughters. She had been wrecked upon the coa&s;t while her children as yet were infants, who of con&s;equence, though grown up, were entirely unacquainted with man. Yet, unexperienced as the young ladies were in the oppo&s;ite &s;ex, both early di&s;covered &s;ymptoms, the one of prudery, the other of being a coquet. The elde&s;t was ever learning maxims of wi&s;dom and di&s;cretion from her mamma, while the younge&s;t employed all her hours in gazing at her own face in a neighbouring fountain.</P>
<P>Their u&s;ual amu&s;ement in this &s;olitude was fi&s;h|ing: Their mother had taught them all the &s;ecrets of the art; &s;he &s;hewed them which were the mo&s;t likely places to throw out the line, what baits were mo&s;t proper for the various &s;ea&s;ons, and the be&s;t manner to draw up the finny prey, when they had hooked it. In this manner they &s;pent their time, ea&s;y and innocent, till one day, the Prince&s;s being indi&s;po&s;ed, de&s;ired them to go and catch her a &s;turgeon or a &s;hark for &s;upper, which &s;he fancied might &s;it ea&s;y on her &s;tomach. The daugh|ters obeyed, and clapping on a gold fi&s;h, the u&s;ual bait, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, went and &s;at upon one of the rocks, letting the gilded hook glide down with the &s;tream.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="108">On the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, farther down, at the mouth of the river, lived a diver for pearls; a youth, who, by long habit in his trade, was al|mo&s;t grown amphibious; &s;o that he could remain whole hours at the bottom of the water, without ever fetching breath. He happened to be at that very in&s;tant diving when the ladies were fi&s;hing with the gilded hook. Seeing therefore the bait, which to him had the appearance of real gold, he was re&s;olved to &s;eize the prize, but both his hands being already filled with pearl oy&s;ters, he found him&s;elf obliged to &s;nap at it with his mouth: The con&s;equence is ea&s;ily imagined; the hook, before unperceived, was in&s;tantly fa&s;tened in his jaw, nor could he, with all his efforts, or his floundering, get free.</P>
<P>"Si&s;ter, cries the younge&s;t Prince&s;s, I have cer|tainly caught a mon&s;trous fi&s;h; I never perceived any thing &s;truggle &s;o at the end of my line before; come, and help me to draw it in." They both now therefore a&s;&s;i&s;ted in fi&s;hing up the Diver on &s;hore; but nothing could equal their &s;urprize upon &s;eeing him. "Ble&s;s my eyes, cries the prude, what have we got here; this is a very odd fi&s;h to be &s;ure; I never &s;aw any thing in my life look &s;o queer; what eyes, what terrible claws, what a mon&s;trous &s;nout; I have read of this mon&s;ter &s;omewhere before, it certainly mu&s;t be a <HI>Tanlang</HI> that eats women; let us throw it back into the &s;ea where we found it.</P>
<P>The Diver in the mean time &s;tood upon the beach, at the end of the line, with the hook in his mouth, u&s;ing every art that he thought could be&s;t excite pity, and particularly looking extremely ten|der, which is u&s;ual in &s;uch circum&s;tances. The
<PB N="101" REF="109">
coquet therefore, in &s;ome mea&s;ure influenced by the innocence of his looks, ventured to contradict her companion. "Upon my word, &s;i&s;ter, &s;ays &s;he, I &s;ee nothing in the animal &s;o very terrible as you are plea&s;ed to apprehend; I think it may &s;erve well enough for a change. Always &s;harks, and &s;turgeons, and lob&s;ters, and crawfi&s;h, make me quite &s;ick. I fancy a &s;lice of this nicely grilladed, and dre&s;&s;ed up with &s;hrimp &s;auce, would be very pretty eating. I fancy mamma would like a bit with pickles above all things in the world; and if it &s;hould not &s;it ea&s;y on her &s;tomach, it will be time enough to di&s;continue it when found di&s;agreeable, you know." "Horrid, cries the prude, would the girl be poi&s;oned; I tell you it is a <HI>Tanlang</HI>; I have read of it in twenty places. It is every where de|&s;cribed as the mo&s;t pernicious animal that ever in|fe&s;ted the ocean. I am certain it is the mo&s;t in&s;idi|ous, ravenous creature in the world; and is certain de&s;truction if taken internally." The younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter was now therefore obliged to &s;ubmit: both a&s;&s;i&s;ted in drawing the hook with &s;ome violence from the Diver's jaw; and he finding him&s;elf at liberty, bent his brea&s;t again&s;t the broad wave and di&s;ap|peared in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this juncture the mother came down to the beach, to know the cau&s;e of her daughter's delay; they told her every circum&s;tance, de&s;crib|ing the mon&s;ter they had caught. The old lady was one of the mo&s;t di&s;creet women in the world; &s;he was called the black-eyed Prince&s;s, from two black eyes &s;he had received in her youth, being a little addicted to boxing in her liquor. "Alas, my children, cries &s;he, what have you done? the fi&s;h you caught was a man-fi&s;h; one of the mo&s;t
<PB N="102" REF="110">
tame dome&s;tic animals in the world. We could have let him run and play about the garden, and he would have been twenty times more entertain|ing than our &s;quirrel or monkey. If that be all, &s;ays the young coquet, we will fi&s;h for him again. If that be all, I'll hold three tooth-picks to one pound of &s;nuff, I catch him whenever I plea&s;e." Accordingly they threw in their line once more, but, with all their gilding, and padling, and a&s;&s;iduity, they could never after catch the Diver. In this &s;tate of &s;olitude and di&s;appointment they continued for many years, &s;till fi&s;hing, but without &s;ucce&s;s; till, at la&s;t, the genius of the place, in pity to their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, changed the prude into a &s;hrimp, and the coquet into an oy&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXVI.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>I AM amu&s;ed, my dear Fum, with the labours of &s;ome of the learned here. One &s;hall write you a whole folio on the direction of a caterpillar. Another &s;hall &s;well his works with a de&s;cription of the plumage on the wing of a butterfly; a third &s;hall &s;ee a little world on a peach leaf, and publi&s;h a book to de&s;cribe what his readers might &s;ee more clearly in two minutes, only by being fur|ni&s;hed with eyes and a micro&s;cope.</P>
<P>I have frequently compared the under&s;tandings of &s;uch men to their own gla&s;&s;es. Their field of vi&s;ion is too contracted to take in the whole of any
<PB N="103" REF="111">
but minute objects; they view all nature bit by bit; now the probo&s;cis, now the antennae, now the pinnae of&mdash;a flea. Now the polypus comes to breakfa&s;t upon a worm; now it is kept up to &s;ee how long it will live without eating; now it is turned in&s;ide outward; and now it &s;ickens and dies. Thus they proceed, laborious in trifles, con&s;tant in experiment, without one &s;ingle ab&s;trac|tion, by which alone knowledge may be properly &s;aid to encrea&s;e; till, at la&s;t, their ideas, ever em|ployed upon minute things, contract to the &s;ize of the diminutive object, and a &s;ingle mite &s;hall fill their whole mind's capacity.</P>
<P>Yet believe me, my friend, ridiculous as the&s;e men are to the world, they are &s;et up as objects of e&s;teem for each other. They have particular places appointed for their meetings; in which one &s;hews his cockle-&s;hell, and is prai&s;ed by all the &s;o|ciety; another produces his powder, makes &s;ome experiments that re&s;ult in nothing, and comes off with admiration and applau&s;e; a third comes out with the important di&s;covery of &s;ome new proce&s;s in the &s;keleton of a mole, and is &s;et down as the accurate and &s;en&s;ible; while one &s;till more fortu|nate than the re&s;t, by pickling, potting, and pre|&s;erving mon&s;ters, ri&s;es into unbounded reputation.</P>
<P>The labours of &s;uch men, in&s;tead of being cal|culated to amu&s;e the public, are laid out only in diverting each other. The world becomes very little the better or the wi&s;er, for knowing what is the peculiar food of an in&s;ect that is it&s;elf the food of another, which in its turn is eaten by a third; but there are men who have &s;tudied them&s;elves into an habit of inve&s;tigating and admiring &s;uch minutiae.

there are &s;ome who contentedly &s;pend whole days in endeavouring to &s;olve aenigmas, or di&s;entangle the puzzling &s;ticks of children.</P>
<P>But of all the learned, tho&s;e who pretend to in|ve&s;tigate remote antiquity, have lea&s;t to plead in their own defence, when they carry this pa&s;&s;ion to a faulty exce&s;s. They are generally found to &s;up|ply by conjecture the want of record, and then by per&s;everance are wrought up into a confidence of the truth of opinions, which even to them&s;elves at fir&s;t appeared founded only in imagination.</P>
<P>The Europeans have heard much of the king|dom of China: its politene&s;s, arts, commerce, laws, and morals, are, however, but very imper|fectly known among them. They have even now in their Indian warehou&s;e numberle&s;s uten&s;ils, plants, minerals, and machines, of the u&s;e of which they are intirely ignorant; nor can any among them even make a probable gue&s;s for what they might have been de&s;igned. Yet though this people be &s;o ignorant of the pre&s;ent real &s;tate of China, the philo&s;ophers I am de&s;crib|ing have entered into long, learned, laborious di&s;|putes about what China was two thou&s;and years ago. China and European happine&s;s are but little connected even at this day; but European happi|ne&s;s and China two thou&s;and years ago have cer|tainly no connection at all. However, the learn|ed have written on and pur&s;ued the &s;ubject thro' all the labyrinths of antiquity; though the early dews and the tainted gale be pa&s;&s;ed away, though no foot&s;teps remain to direct the doubtful chace, yet &s;till they run forward, open upon the uncertain &s;cent, and though in fact they follow nothing, are earne&s;t in the pur&s;uit. In this chace however they
<PB N="105" REF="113">
all take different ways. One, for example, confi|dently a&s;&s;ures us, that China was peopled by a co|lony from Egypt. Se&s;o&s;tris, he ob&s;erves, led his army as far as the Ganges; therefore, if he went &s;o far, he might &s;till have gone as far as China, which is but about a thou&s;and miles from thence; therefore he did go to China; therefore China was not peopled before he went there; therefore it was peopled by him. Be&s;ides, the Egyptians have py|ramids; the Chine&s;e have in like manner their por|celaine tower; the Egyptians u&s;ed to light up can|dles upon every rejoicing, the Chine&s;e have lant|horns upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion; the Egyptians had their great river, &s;o have the Chine&s;e; but what &s;erves to put the matter pa&s;t a doubt is, that the antient Kings of China and tho&s;e of Egypt were called by the &s;ame names. The Emperor Ki is certainly the &s;ame with King Atoes; for, if we only change <HI>K</HI> into <HI>A,</HI> and <HI>i</HI> into <HI>toes,</HI> we &s;hall have the name Atoes; and with equal ea&s;e <HI>Menes</HI> may be proved to be the &s;ame with the Emperor <HI>Yu</HI>; therefore the Chine&s;e are a colony from Egypt.</P>
<P>But another of the learned is entirely different from the la&s;t; and he will have the Chine&s;e to be a colony planted by Noah ju&s;t after the deluge. Fir&s;t, from the va&s;t &s;imilitude there is between the name of Fohi, the founder of the Chine&s;e monarchy, and that of Noah, the pre&s;erver of the human race: Noah, Fohi, very like each other truly; they have each but four letters, and only two of the four happen to differ. But to &s;trengthen the argu|ment, Fohi, as the Chine&s;e chronicle a&s;&s;erts, had no father. Noah, it is true, had a father, as the European Bible tells us; but then, as this father was probably drowned in the flood, it is ju&s;t the
<PB N="106" REF="114">
&s;ame as if he had no father at all; therefore Noah and Fohi are the &s;ame, Ju&s;t after the flood, the earth was covered with mud; if it was covered with mud, it mu&s;t have been incru&s;tated mud; if it was incru&s;tated, it was cloathed with ver|dure; this was a fine, unembarra&s;&s;ed road for Noah to fly from his wicked children; he there|fore did fly from them, and took a journey of two thou&s;and miles for his own amu&s;ement; therefore Noah and Fohi are the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Another &s;ect of literati, for they all pa&s;s among the vulgar for very great &s;cholars, a&s;&s;ert, that the Chine&s;e came neither from the colony of Se|&s;o&s;tris, nor from Noah, but are de&s;cended from Magog, Me&s;hec and Tubal, and therefore neither Se&s;o&s;tris, nor Noah, nor Fohi are the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It is thus, my friend, that indolence a&s;&s;umes the airs of wi&s;dom, and while it to&s;&s;es the cup and ball with infantine folly, de&s;ires the world to look on, and calls the &s;tupid pa&s;time, philo&s;o|phy and learning. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXVII.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the men of this country are once turned of thirty, they regularly retire every year at proper intervals to lie in of the <HI>&s;pleen.</HI> The vulgar, unfurni&s;hed with the luxurious comforts of the &s;oft cu&s;&s;ion, down bed, and ea&s;y chair, are obliged when the fit is on them, to nur&s;e it up by drinking, idlene&s;s and ill-humour. In &s;uch
<PB N="107" REF="115">
di&s;po&s;itions, unhappy is the foreigner who hap|pens to cro&s;s them; his long chin, tarni&s;hed coat, or pinched hat, are &s;ure to receive no quar|ter. If they meet no foreigner however to fight with, they are in &s;uch ca&s;es generally content with beating each other.</P>
<P>The rich, as they have more &s;en&s;ibility, are operated upon with greater violence by this di&s;|order. Different from the poor, in&s;tead of becom|ing more in&s;olent, they grow totally unfit for op|po&s;ition. A general here, who would have faced a culverin when well, if the fit be on him, &s;hall hardly find courage to &s;nuff a candle. An ad|miral, who could have oppo&s;ed a broad&s;ide with|out &s;hrinking, &s;hall &s;it whole days in his cham|ber, mobbed up in double night-caps, &s;huddering at the intru&s;ive breeze, and di&s;tingui&s;hable from his wife only by his black beard and heavy eye|brows.</P>
<P>In the country this di&s;order mo&s;tly attacks the fair &s;ex, in town it is mo&s;t unfavourable to the men. A lady, who has pined whole years amid&s;t cooing doves, and complaining nightingales in rural re|tirement, &s;hall re&s;ume all her vivacity in one night at a city gaming-table; her hu&s;band who roar'd, hunted, and got drunk at home, &s;hall grow &s;plenetic in town in proportion to his wife's good humour. Upon their arrival in London, they exchange their di&s;orders. In con&s;equence of her parties and excur&s;ions, he puts on the furred cap and &s;carlet &s;tomacher, and perfectly re&s;embles an Indian hu&s;band, who when his wife is &s;afely delivered, permits her to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s abroad, while he undergoes all the formality of keeping his bed, and receiving all the condolence in her place.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="116">But tho&s;e who re&s;ide con&s;tantly in town, owe this di&s;order mo&s;tly to the influence of the wea|ther. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe what a variety of tran&s;mutations an ea&s;t wind &s;hall produce; it has been known to change a Lady of fa&s;hion into a parlour couch; an Alderman into a plate of cu&s;|tards, and a di&s;pen&s;er of ju&s;tice into a rat trap. Even Philo&s;ophers them&s;elves are not exempt from its influence; it has often converted a Poet into a coral and bells, and a patriot Senator into a dumb waiter.</P>
<P>Some days ago I went to vi&s;it the man in black, and entered his hou&s;e with that chearfulne&s;s, which the certainty of a favourable reception al|ways in&s;pires. Upon opening the door of his apartment, I found him with the mo&s;t rueful face imaginable in a morning gown and flannel night|cap, earne&s;tly employed in learning to blow the German flute. Struck with the ab&s;urdity of a man in the decline of life, thus blowing away all his con&s;titution and &s;pirits, even without the con|&s;olation of being mu&s;ical; I ventured to a&s;k what could induce him to attempt learning &s;o difficult an in&s;trument &s;o late in life. To this he made no reply, but groaning, and &s;till holding the flute to his lip, continued to gaze at me for &s;ome mo|ments very angrily, and then proceeded to prac|ti&s;e his gammut as before. After having produced a variety of the mo&s;t hideous tones in nature; at la&s;t turning to me, he demanded, whether I did not think he had made a &s;urprizing progre&s;s in two days? You &s;ee, continues he, I have got the Ambu&s;heer already, and as for fingering, my ma&s;ter tells me, I &s;hall have that in a few le&s;&s;ons more. I was &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed with this in&s;tance of inverted ambition, that I know not what to re|ply,
<PB N="109" REF="117">
but &s;oon di&s;cerned the cau&s;e of all his ab|&s;urdities; my friend was under a metamorpho&s;is by the power of &s;pleen, and flute-blowing was unluckily become his adventitious pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In order therefore to bani&s;h his anxiety imper|ceptibly, by &s;eeming to indulge it, I began to de&s;|cant on tho&s;e gloomy topics by which Philo&s;ophers often get rid of their own &s;pleen, by communi|cating it; the wretchedne&s;s of a man in this life, the happine&s;s of &s;ome wrought out of the mi&s;eries of others, the nece&s;&s;ity that wretches &s;hould ex|pire under puni&s;hment, that rogues might enjoy affluence in tranquility; I led him on from the inhumanity of the rich to the ingratitude of the beggar; from the in&s;incerity of refinement to the fiercene&s;s of ru&s;ticity; and at la&s;t had the good fortune to re&s;tore him to his u&s;ual &s;erenity of temper, by permitting him to expatiate upon all the modes of human mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>'Some nights ago, &s;ays my friend, &s;itting alone by my fire, I happened to look into an account of the detection of a &s;et of men called the thief-takers. I read over the many hideous cruelties of tho&s;e haters of mankind, of their pretended friend&s;hip to wretches they meant to betray, of their &s;ending men out to rob and then hanging them. I could not avoid &s;ometimes interrupting the nar|rative by crying out, <HI>Yet the&s;e are men!</HI> As I went on, I was informed that they had lived by this prac|tice &s;everal years, and had been enriched by the price of blood, <HI>and yet,</HI> cried I, <HI>I have been &s;ent into this world, and am de&s;ired to call the&s;e men my bro|th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rs!</HI> I read that the very man who led the con|demned wretch to the gallows, was he who fal&s;ely &s;wore his life away; <HI>and yet,</HI> continued I, <HI>that perjurer
had
<PB N="110" REF="118">
ju&s;t &s;uch a no&s;e, &s;uch lips, &s;uch hands and &s;uch eyes as Newton.</HI> I at la&s;t came to the account of the wretch that was &s;earched after robbing one of the thief-takers of half a crown. Tho&s;e of the confederacy knew that he had got but that &s;ingle half crown in the world; after a long &s;earch therefore, which they knew would be fruitle&s;s, and taking from him the half crown, which they knew was all he had, one of the gang compa&s;|&s;ionately cried out, <HI>Alas, poor a creature let him keep all the re&s;t he has got, it will do him &s;ervice in Newgate, where we are &s;ending him.</HI> This was an in&s;tance of &s;uch complicated guilt and hypo|cri&s;y, that I threw down the book in an agony of rage, and began to think with malice of all the hu|man kind. I &s;at &s;ilent for &s;ome minutes, and &s;oon perceiving the ticking of my watch begin|ning to grow noi&s;y and trouble&s;ome, I quickly placed it out of hearing, and &s;trove to re&s;ume my &s;erenity. But the watch-man &s;oon gave me a &s;econd alarm. I had &s;carcely recovered from this, when my peace was a&s;&s;aulted by the wind at my window; and when that cea&s;ed to blow, I li&s;tened for death-watches in the wain&s;cot. I now found my whole &s;y&s;tem di&s;compo&s;ed, I &s;trove to find a re&s;ource in philo&s;ophy and rea&s;on; but what could I oppo&s;e, or where direct my blow, when I could &s;ee no enemy to combat. I &s;aw no mi&s;ery approaching, nor knew any I had to fear, yet &s;till I was mi&s;erable. Morning came, I &s;ought for tranquility in di&s;&s;ipation, &s;auntered from one place of public re&s;ort to another, but found my|&s;elf di&s;agreeable to my acquaintance, and ridi|culous to others.

<P>IT is no unplea&s;ing contemplation to con&s;ider the influence which &s;oil and climate have upon the di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants, the animals and vegetables of different countries. That among the brute creation is much more vi&s;ible than in man, and that in vegetables more than either. In &s;ome places tho&s;e plants which are entirely poi&s;on|ous at home lo&s;e their deleterious quality by be|ing carried abroad; there are &s;erpents in Ma|cedonia &s;o harmle&s;s as to be u&s;ed as play-things for children, and we are told that in &s;ome parts of Fez there are lions &s;o very timorous as to be &s;cared away, though coming in herds, by the cries of women.</P>
<P>I know of no country where the influence of cli|mate and &s;oil is more vi&s;ible than in England; the &s;ame hidden cau&s;e which gives courage to their dogs and cocks, gives al&s;o fiercene&s;s to their men. But chiefly this ferocity appears among the vul|gar. The polite of every country pretty nearly re&s;emble each other. But as in &s;impleing, it is among the uncultivated productions of nature, we are to examine the characteri&s;tic differences of climate and &s;oil, &s;o in an e&s;timate of the genius of the people, we mu&s;t look among the &s;ons of unpoli&s;hed ru&s;ticity. The vulgar Engli&s;h there|fore may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the re&s;t
<PB N="112" REF="120">
of the world, by &s;uperior pride, impatience, and a peculiar hardine&s;s of &s;oul.</P>
<P>Perhaps no qualities in the world are more &s;u&s;|ceptible of a fine poli&s;h than the&s;e; artificial com|plai&s;ance and ea&s;y deference being &s;uperinduced over the&s;e, generally forms a great character; &s;ome|thing at once elegant and maje&s;tic, affable yet &s;in|cere. Such in general are the better &s;ort; but they who are left in primitive rudene&s;s are the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed for &s;ociety with others, or comfort inter|nally, of any people under the &s;un.</P>
<P>The poor indeed of every country are but little prone to treat each other with tenderne&s;s; their own mi&s;eries are too apt to engro&s;s all their pity; and perhaps too they give but little commi&s;eration, as they find but little from others. But, in Eng|land, the poor treat each other upon every occa&s;ion with more than &s;avage animo&s;ity, and as if they were in a &s;tate of open war by nature. In China, if two porters &s;hould meet in a narrow &s;treet, they would lay down their burthens, make a thou&s;and excu&s;es to each other for the accidental interrup|tion, and beg pardon on their knees; if two men of the &s;ame occupation &s;hould meet here, they would fir&s;t begin to &s;cold, and at la&s;t to beat each other. One would think they had mi&s;eries enough re&s;ulting from penury and labour not to encrea&s;e them by ill-nature among them&s;elves, and &s;ubjec|tion to new penalties, but &s;uch con&s;iderations never weigh with them.</P>
<P>But to recompence this &s;trange ab&s;urdity they are in the main generous, brave, and enterpri&s;ing. They feel the &s;lighte&s;t injuries with a degree of ungoverned impatience, but re&s;i&s;t the greate&s;t ca|lamities with &s;urprizing fortitude. Tho&s;e mi&s;eries
<PB N="113" REF="121">
under which any other people in the world would &s;ink, they have often &s;hewed they were capable of enduring; if accidentally ca&s;t upon &s;ome de&s;olate coa&s;t, their per&s;everance is beyond what any other nation is capable of &s;u&s;taining; if impri&s;oned for crimes, their efforts to e&s;cape are greater than among others. The peculiar &s;trength of their pri&s;ons, when compared to tho&s;e el&s;ewhere, argues their hardine&s;s; even the &s;tronge&s;t pri&s;ons I have ever &s;een in other countries would be very in&s;ufficient to confine the untameable &s;pirit of an Engli&s;hman. In &s;hort, what man dares do in circum&s;tances of danger, an Engli&s;hman will. His virtues &s;eem to &s;leep in the calm, and are called out only to com|bat the kindred &s;torm.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t eulogy of this people is the genero&s;ity of their mi&s;creants; the tenderne&s;s in general of their robbers and highwaymen. Per|haps no people can produce in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind, where the de&s;perate mix pity with inju&s;|tice; &s;till &s;hew that they under&s;tand a di&s;tinction in crimes, and even, in acts of violence, have &s;till &s;ome tincture of remaining virtue. In every other country robbery and murder go almo&s;t always to|gether; here it &s;eldom happens, except upon ill-judged re&s;i&s;tance or pur&s;uit. The banditti of other countries are unmerciful to a &s;upreme de|gree; the highwayman and robber here are gene|rous at lea&s;t to the public, and pretend even to virtues in their intercour&s;e among each other. Taking therefore my opinion of the Engli&s;h from the virtues and vices practi&s;ed among the vulgar, they at once pre&s;ent to a &s;tranger all their faults, and keep their virtues up only for the enquiring eye of a philo&s;opher.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="122">Foreigners are generally &s;hocked at their in&s;o|lence upon fir&s;t coming among them; they find them&s;elves ridiculed and in&s;ulted in every &s;treet; they meet with none of tho&s;e trifling civilities, &s;o frequent el&s;ewhere, which are in&s;tances of mutual good-will without previous acquaintance; they travel through the country either too ignorant or too ob&s;tinate to cultivate a clo&s;er acquaintance, meet every moment &s;omething to excite their di&s;|gu&s;t, and return home to characteri&s;e this as the region of &s;pleen, in&s;olence, and ill-nature.

<P>THE mind is ever ingenious in making its own di&s;tre&s;s.

ambition will be &s;ure to taint his future happine&s;s, either with jealou&s;y, di&s;appointment, or fatigue.</P>
<P>But of all the arts of di&s;tre&s;s found out by man for his own torment, perhaps, that of philo&s;ophic mi&s;ery is mo&s;t truly ridiculous, a pa&s;&s;ion no where carried to &s;o extravagant an exce&s;s as in the coun|try where I now re&s;ide.

<P>My landlady &s;ome days ago brought me the di|ary of a philo&s;opher of this de&s;ponding &s;ort, who had lodged in the apartment before me.

How terrible will it be, when the motions of all the

<P><HI>Tue&s;day.</HI> Went to bed in great di&s;tre&s;s, awaked and was comforted, by con&s;idering that this change was to happen at &s;ome indefinite time, and therefore, like death, the thoughts of it might ea&s;ily be borne. But there is a revolution, a fixed determined revolution, which mu&s;t cer|tainly come to pa&s;s; yet which, by good fortune, I &s;hall never feel, except in my po&s;terity. The obliquity of the equator with the ecliptic is now twenty minutes le&s;s than when it was ob&s;erved two thou&s;and years ago by <HI>Piteas.</HI> If this be the ca&s;e, in &s;ix thou&s;and the obliquity will be &s;till le&s;s by an whole degree.

<P>IT is &s;urprizing what an influence titles &s;hall have upon the mind, even though the&s;e titles be of our own making. Like children we dre&s;s up the puppets in finery, and then &s;tand in a&s;toni&s;h|ment at the pla&s;tic wonder. I have been told of a rat catcher here, who &s;trolled for a long time about the villages near town, without finding any employment; at la&s;t, however, he thought proper to take the title of his Maje&s;ty's Rat catcher in or|dinary, and this &s;ucceeded beyond his expecta|tions; when it was known that he caught rats at
<PB N="119" REF="127">
court, all were ready to give him countenance and employment.</P>
<P>But of all the people, they who make books &s;eem mo&s;t perfectly &s;en&s;ible of the advantage of ti|tular dignity. All &s;eem convinced, that a book written by vulgar hands, can neither in&s;truct nor improve; none but Kings, Chams, and Manda|rines, can write with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s. If the titles inform me right, not only Kings and Courtiers, but Emperors them&s;elves in this coun|try, periodically &s;upply the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>A man here who &s;hould write, and hone&s;tly confe&s;s that he wrote for bread, might as well &s;end his manu&s;cript to fire the baker's oven; not one creature will read him; all mu&s;t be court-bred poets, or pretend at lea&s;t to be court-bred, who can expect to plea&s;e. Should the caitiff fairly avow a de&s;ign of emptying our pockets and filling his own, every reader would in&s;tantly for&s;ake him; even tho&s;e, who write for bread them&s;elves, would combine to worry him, perfectly &s;en&s;ible, that his attempts only &s;erved to take the bread out of their mouths.</P>
<P>And yet this &s;illy prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the more amazes me, when I con&s;ider, that almo&s;t all the excellent productions in wit that have appeared here, were purely the offspring of nece&s;&s;ity; their Drydens, Butlers, Otways, and Farquhars, were all writers for bread. Believe me, my friend, hunger has a mo&s;t amazing faculty of &s;harpening the genius; and he who with a full belly, can think like a hero, after a cour&s;e of fa&s;ting, &s;hall ri&s;e to the &s;ublimity of a demi-god.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="128">But what will mo&s;t amaze, is, that this very &s;et of men, who are now &s;o much depreciated by fools, are however the very be&s;t writers they have among them at pre&s;ent. For my own part, were I to buy an hat, I would not have it from a &s;tock|ing-maker, but an hatter; were I to buy &s;hoes, I &s;hould not go to the taylor's for that purpo&s;e. It is ju&s;t &s;o with regard to wit: did I, for my life, de&s;ire to be well &s;erved, I would apply only to tho&s;e who made it their trade, and lived by it. You &s;mile at the oddity of my opinion; but be a&s;|&s;ured, my friend, that wit is in &s;ome mea&s;ure me|chanical: and that a man long habituated to catch at even its re&s;emblance, will at la&s;t be happy enough to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ub&s;tance: by a long habit of writing he acquires a ju&s;tne&s;s of thinking, and a ma&s;tery of manner, which holiday-writers, even with ten times his genius, may vainly attempt to equal.</P>
<P>How then are they deceived, who expect from title, dignity, and exterior circum&s;tance, an excel|lence, which is in &s;ome mea&s;ure acquired by habit, and &s;harpened by nece&s;&s;ity; you have &s;een, like me, many literary reputations promoted by the influ|ence of fa&s;hion, which have &s;carce &s;urvived the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; you have &s;een the poor hardly earn the little reputation they acquired, and their merit only acknowledged when they were incapable of enjoying the plea&s;ures of popularity; &s;uch, how|ever, is the reputation worth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, that which is hardly earned is hardly lo&s;t.</P>

<P>WHERE will my di&s;appointments end? Mu&s;t I &s;till be doomed to accu&s;e the &s;everity of my fortune, and &s;hew my con&s;tancy in di&s;tre&s;s ra|ther than moderation in pro&s;perity? I had at lea&s;t hopes of conveying my charming companion &s;afe from the reach of every enemy, and of again re|&s;toring her to her native &s;oil. But tho&s;e hopes are now no more.</P>
<P>Upon leaving Terki, we took the neare&s;t road to the dominions of Ru&s;&s;ia. We pa&s;&s;ed the Ural mountains covered in eternal &s;now, and traver&s;ed the fore&s;ts of Ufa, where the prowling bear and &s;hrieking hyena keep an undi&s;puted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We next embarked upon the rapid river Bulija, and made the be&s;t of our way to the banks of the Wolga, where it waters the fruitful valleys of Ca|&s;an.</P>
<P>There were two ve&s;&s;els in company properly equipped and armed in order to oppo&s;e the Wolga pyrates, who we were informed infe&s;ted this river. Of all mankind the&s;e pyrates are the mo&s;t terrible. They are compo&s;ed of the criminals and outlawed pea&s;ants of Ru&s;&s;ia, who fly to the fore&s;ts that lie along the banks of the Wolga for protection. Here they join in parties, lead a &s;avage life, and have no other &s;ub&s;i&s;tence but plunder. Being deprived of hou&s;es, friends, or a fixed habitation, they be|come more terrible even than the tyger, and as in|&s;en&s;ible
<PB N="122" REF="130">
to all the feelings of humanity. They nei|ther give quarter to tho&s;e they conquer, nor re|ceive it when overpowered them&s;elves. The &s;eve|rity of the laws again&s;t them &s;erve to encrea&s;e their barbarity, and &s;eem to make them a neutral &s;pecies of beings between the wildne&s;s of the lion and the &s;ubtilty of the man. When taken alive their puni&s;hment is hideous. A floating gibbet is erected, which is let run down with the &s;tream; here upon an iron hook &s;tuck under their ribs, and upon which the whole weight of their body de|pends, they are left to expire in the mo&s;t terrible agonies; &s;ome being thus found to linger &s;everal days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively.</P>
<P>We were but three days voyage from the con|fluence of this river into the Wolga, when we perceived at a di&s;tance behind us an armed barque coming up with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ails and oars, in order to attack us. The dreadful &s;ignal of death was hung upon the ma&s;t, and our captain with his gla&s;s could ea&s;ily di&s;cern them to be pyrates. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s our con&s;ternation on this occa&s;ion; the whole crew in&s;tantly came together to con&s;ult the propere&s;t means of &s;afety. It was therefore &s;oon determined to &s;end off our women and valuable commodities in one of our ve&s;&s;els, and that the men &s;hould &s;tay in the other and boldly oppo&s;e the enemy. This re&s;olution was &s;oon put into execution, and I now reluctantly parted from the beautiful Zelis for the fir&s;t time &s;ince our retreat from Per&s;ia. The ve&s;&s;el in which &s;he was di&s;appeared to my longing eyes, in pro|portion as that of the pyrates approached us. They &s;oon came up; but, upon examining our &s;trength, and perhaps &s;en&s;ible of the manner in which we
<PB N="123" REF="131">
had &s;ent off our mo&s;t valuable effects, they &s;eemed more eager to pur&s;ue the ve&s;&s;el we had &s;ent away than attack us. In this manner they continued to harra&s;s us for three days; &s;till endeavouring to pa&s;s us without fighting. But, on the fourth day, finding it entirely impo&s;&s;ible, and de&s;pairing to &s;eize the expected booty, they de&s;i&s;ted from their endeavours, and left us to pur&s;ue our voyage with|out interruption.</P>
<P>Our joy on this occa&s;ion was great; but &s;oon a di&s;appointment more terrible, becau&s;e unexpected, &s;ucceeded. The barque, in which our women and trea&s;ure were &s;ent off, was wrecked upon the banks of the Wolga, for want of a proper number of hands to manage her, and the whole crew carried by the pea&s;ants up the country. Of this however we were not &s;en&s;ible till our arrival at Mo&s;cow; where expecting to meet our &s;eparated barque, we were informed of its misfortune, and our lo&s;s. Need I paint the &s;ituation of my mind on this occa&s;ion? Need I de&s;cribe all I feel, when I de&s;pair of beholding the beautiful Zelis more! Fancy had dre&s;&s;ed the future pro&s;pect of my life in the gaye&s;t colouring; but one unex|pected &s;troke of fortune has robbed it of every charm. Her dear idea mixes with every &s;cene of plea&s;ure, and without her pre&s;ence to enliven it, the whole becomes tedious, in&s;ipid, in&s;upportable. I will confe&s;s, now that &s;he is lo&s;t, I will confe&s;s, I loved her; nor is it in the power of time, or of rea&s;on, to era&s;e her image from my heart.</P>

<P>YOUR misfortunes are mine. But as every period of life is marked with its own, you mu&s;t learn to endure them. Di&s;appointed love makes the mi&s;ery of youth; di&s;appointed ambition, that of manhood; and &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s avarice, that of age. The&s;e three attack us through life; and it is our duty to &s;tand upon our guard. To love, we ought to oppo&s;e di&s;&s;ipation, and endeavour to change the object of the affections; to ambition, the happi|ne&s;s of indolence and ob&s;curity; and to avarice, the fear of &s;oon dying. The&s;e are the &s;hields with which we &s;hould arm our&s;elves; and thus make every &s;cene of life, if not plea&s;ing, at lea&s;t &s;up|portable.</P>
<P>Men complain of not finding a place of repo&s;e. They are in the wrong; they have it for &s;eeking. What they &s;hould indeed complain of is, that the heart is an enemy to that very repo&s;e they &s;eek. To them&s;elves alone &s;hould they impute their di&s;|content. They &s;eek within the &s;hort &s;pan of life to &s;atisfy a thou&s;and de&s;ires; each of which alone is un&s;atiable. One month pa&s;&s;es and another comes on; the year ends and then begins; but man is &s;till unchanging in folly, &s;till blindly continuing in prejudice. To the wi&s;e man, every climate and every &s;oil is plea&s;ing; to him a parterre of flowers is the famous valley of gold; to him, a little brook,

<P>The life of man is a journey; a journey that mu&s;t be travelled, however bad the roads or the accommodation. If, in the beginning, it is found dangerous, narrow, and difficult, it mu&s;t either grow better in the end, or we &s;hall by cu&s;tom learn to bear its inequality.</P>
<P>But though I &s;ee you incapable of penetrating into grand principles, attend at lea&s;t to a &s;imile adapted to every apprehen&s;ion. I am mounted upon a wretched a&s;s. I &s;ee another man before me upon a &s;prightly hor&s;e, at which I find &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s I look behind me and &s;ee numbers on foot &s;tooping under heavy burdens; let me learn to pity their e&s;tate, and thank heaven for my own.</P>
<P>Shingfu, when under misfortunes, would in the beginning weep like a child; but he &s;oon recovered his former tranquility.

he, who had grieved &s;o much, and given way to the calamity the day before, could now be &s;o chearful?

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XCIII.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, fir&s;t pre&s;i|dent of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>THE manner of grieving for our departed friends in China is very different from that of Europe. The mourning colour of Europe is black; that of China white. When a parent or relation dies here, for they &s;eldom mourn for friends, it is only clap|ping on a &s;uit of &s;ables, grimacing it for a few days, and all, &s;oon forgotten, goes on as before; not a &s;ingle creature mi&s;&s;ing the decea&s;ed, except perhaps a favourite hou&s;e-keeper or a favourite cat.</P>
<P>On the contrary, with us in China it is a very &s;erious affair. The piety with which I have &s;een you behave on one of the&s;e occa&s;ions &s;hould never be forgotten. I remember it was upon the death of thy grandmother's maiden &s;i&s;ter. The coffin was
<PB N="127" REF="135">
expo&s;ed in the principal hall in public view. Be|fore it were placed the figures of eunuchs, hor&s;es, tortoi&s;es, and other animals, in attitudes of grief and re&s;pect. The more di&s;tant relations of the old lady, and I among the number, came to pay our compliments of condolance, and to &s;alute the de|cea&s;ed after the manner of our country. We had &s;carce pre&s;ented our wax candles and perfumes, and given the howl of departure, when, crawling on his belly from under a curtain, out came the reverend Fum Hoam him&s;elf, in all the di&s;mal &s;o|lemnity of di&s;tre&s;s. Your looks were &s;et for &s;or|row; your cloathing con&s;i&s;ted in an hempen bag tied round the neck with a &s;tring. For two long months did this mourning continue. By night you lay &s;tretched on a &s;ingle mat, and &s;ate on the &s;tool of di&s;content by day. Pious man, who could thus &s;et an example of &s;orrow and decorum to our country. Pious country, where, if we do not grieve at the departure of our friends for their &s;akes, at lea&s;t we are taught to regret them for our own.</P>
<P>All is very different here; amazement all. What &s;ort of a people am I got among&s;t! Fum, thou &s;on of Fo, what &s;ort of people am I got among&s;t! No crawling round the coffin; no dre&s;&s;ing up in hempen bags; no lying on mats, or &s;itting on &s;tools. Gentlemen here &s;hall put on fir&s;t mourn|ing with as &s;prightly an air as if preparing for a birth-night; and widows &s;hall actually dre&s;s for another hu&s;band in their weeds for the former. The be&s;t je&s;t of all is, that our merry mourners clap bits of mu&s;lin on their &s;leeves, and the&s;e are called <HI>weepers.</HI> Weeping mu&s;lin; alas, alas, very
<PB N="128" REF="136">
&s;orrowful truly! The&s;e weepers then it &s;eems are to bear the whole burthen of the di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>But I have had the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tance of this contra&s;t; this tragi-comical behaviour in di&s;tre&s;s upon a recent occa&s;ion. Their King, who&s;e de|parture, though &s;udden, was not unexpected, died after a reign of many years. His age, and uncer|tain &s;tate of health, &s;erved in &s;ome mea&s;ure to di|mini&s;h the &s;orrow of his &s;ubjects; and their expec|tations from his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;eemed to balance their minds between unea&s;ine&s;s and &s;atisfaction. But how ought they to have behaved on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion? Surely, they ought rather to have endea|voured to te&s;tify their <HI>gratitude</HI> to their decea&s;ed friend, than to proclaim their <HI>hopes</HI> of the future. Sure even the Succe&s;&s;or mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e their love to wear the face of adulation, which &s;o quickly chang|ed the object. However, the very &s;ame day on which the old King died, they made rejoicing for the new.</P>
<P>For my part, I have no conception of this new manner of mourning and rejoicing in a breath; of being merry and &s;ad; of mixing a funeral proce&s;|&s;ion with a jig and a bonfire. At lea&s;t, it would have been ju&s;t, that they who flattered the King while living for virtues which he had not, &s;hould lament him dead for tho&s;e he really had.</P>
<P>In this univer&s;al cau&s;e for national di&s;tre&s;s, as I had no intere&s;t my&s;elf, &s;o it is but natural to &s;up|po&s;e, I felt no real affliction. In all the lo&s;&s;es of our friends, &s;ays an European philo&s;opher, we fir&s;t con&s;ider how much our own welfare is affected by their departure, and moderate our real grief ju&s;t in
<PB N="129" REF="137">
the &s;ame proportion. Now, as I had neither re|ceived nor expected to receive favours from Kings or their flatterers; as I had no acquaintance in particular with their late monarch; as I knew that the place of a King is &s;oon &s;upplied; and as the Chine&s;e proverb has it, that though the world may &s;ometimes want coblers to mend their &s;hoes, there is no danger of its wanting Emperors to rule their kingdoms; from &s;uch con&s;iderations, I could bear the lo&s;s of a King with the mo&s;t philo&s;ophic re&s;ig|nation. However, I thought it my duty at lea&s;t to appear &s;orrowful; to put on a melancholy a&s;pect, or to &s;et my face by that of the people.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t company I came among&s;t after the news became general, was a &s;et of jolly companions who were drinking pro&s;perity to the en&s;uing reign. I entered the room with looks of de&s;pair, and even expected applau&s;e for the &s;uperlative mi&s;ery of my countenance. In&s;tead of that I was univer&s;ally condemned by the company for a grimacing &s;on of a whore, and de&s;ired to take away my penitential phyz to &s;ome other quarter. I now corrected my former mi&s;take, and with the mo&s;t &s;prightly air imaginable entered a company, where they were talking over the ceremonies of the approaching fu|neral. Here I &s;at for &s;ome time with an air of pert vivacity; when one of the chief mourners im|mediately ob&s;erving my good humour, de&s;ired me, if I plea&s;ed to go and grin &s;omewhere el&s;e; they wanted no di&s;affected &s;coundrels there. Leaving this company therefore, I was re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume a look perfectly neutral; and have ever &s;ince been &s;tudying the fa&s;hionable air: &s;omething between je&s;t and earne&s;t; a complete virginity of face, un|contaminated with the &s;malle&s;t &s;ymptom of meaning.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="138">But though grief be a very &s;light affair here, the mourning, my friend, is a very important con|cern. When an Emperor dies in China, the whole expence of the &s;olemnities is defrayed from the royal coffers. When the great die here, Manda|rines are ready enough to order mourning; but I do not &s;ee that they are &s;o ready to pay for it. If they &s;end me down from court the grey undre&s;s frock, or the black coat without pocket holes, I am willing enough to comply with their commands, and wear both; but, by the head of Confucius! to be obliged to wear black, and buy it into the bargain, is more than my tranquility of temper can bear. What, order me to wear mourning before they know whether I can buy it or no! Fum, thou &s;on of Fo, what &s;ort of a people am I got among&s;t; where being out of black is a certain &s;ymptom of poverty; where tho&s;e who have mi&s;erable faces cannot have mourning, and tho&s;e who have mourn|ing will not wear a mi&s;erable face!</P>

<P>IT is u&s;ual for the book&s;ellers here, when a book has given univer&s;al plea&s;ure upon one &s;ubject, to bring out &s;everal more upon the &s;ame plan; which are &s;ure to have purcha&s;ers and readers from that de&s;ire which all men have to view a plea&s;ing object on every &s;ide.

<P>This manner, however, of drawing off a &s;ubject, or a peculiar mode of writing to the dregs, effec|tually precludes a revival of that &s;ubject or manner for &s;ome time for the future; the &s;ated reader turns from it with a kind of literary nau&s;ea; and though the titles of books are the part of them mo&s;t read, yet he has &s;carce per&s;everance enough to wade through the title page.</P>

grace enough to wade above two pages deep into <HI>Thoughts upon God and Nature,</HI> or <HI>Thoughts upon Providence,</HI> or <HI>Thoughts upon Free Grace,</HI> or indeed into Thoughts upon any thing at all. I can no longer meditate with Meditations for every day in the year; E&s;&s;ays upon divers &s;ubjects cannot allure me, though never &s;o intere&s;ting; and as for Fune|ral Sermons, or even Thank&s;giving Sermons, I can neither weep with the one, nor rejoice with the other.</P>
<P>But it is chiefly in gentle poetry, where I &s;eldom look farther than the title. The truth is, I take up books to be told &s;omething new; but here, as it is now managed, the reader is told nothing. He opens the book, and there finds very good words, truly, and much exactne&s;s of rhyme, but no infor|mation. A parcel of gaudy images pa&s;s on before his imagination like the figures in a dream; but curio&s;ity, induction, rea&s;on, and the whole train of affections are fa&s;t a&s;leep. The <HI>jocunda et idonea vitae</HI>; tho&s;e &s;allies which mend the heart while they amu&s;e the fancy, are quite forgotten: &s;o that a reader who would take up &s;ome modern ap|plauded performances of this kind, mu&s;t, in order to be plea&s;ed, fir&s;t leave his good &s;en&s;e behind him, take for his recompence and guide bloated and compound epithet, and dwell on paintings, ju&s;t indeed, becau&s;e laboured with minute exact|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>If we examine, however, our internal &s;en&s;ations, we &s;hall find our&s;elves but little plea&s;ed with &s;uch laboured vanities; we &s;hall find that our applau&s;e rather proceeds from a kind of contagion caught up from others, and which we contribute to dif|fu&s;e, than from what we privately feel. There are
<PB N="133" REF="141">
&s;ome &s;ubjects of which almo&s;t all the world per|ceive the futility; yet all combine in impo&s;ing upon each other, as worthy of prai&s;e. But chiefly this impo&s;ition obtains in literature, where men publicly contemn what they reli&s;h with rapture in private, and approve abroad what has given them di&s;gu&s;t at home. The truth is, we deliver tho&s;e critici&s;ms in public which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be be&s;t calculated not to do ju&s;tice to the author, but to impre&s;s others with an opinion of our &s;uperior di&s;|cernment.</P>
<P>But let works of this kind, which have already come off with &s;uch applau&s;e, enjoy it all. It is neither my wi&s;h to dimini&s;h, as I was never con&s;ider|able enough to add to their fame. But for the future I fear there are many poems, of which I &s;hall find &s;pirits to read but the title. In the fir&s;t place, all odes upon winter, or &s;ummer, or autumn; in &s;hort all odes, epodes, and monodies what&s;oever, &s;hall hereafter be deemed too polite, cla&s;&s;ical, ob&s;cure, and refined, to be read, and entirely above hu|man comprehen&s;ion. Pa&s;torals are pretty enough &mdash;for tho&s;e that like them&mdash;but to me Thyr&s;is is one of the mo&s;t in&s;ipid fellows I ever conver&s;ed with; and as for Corridon, I do not chu&s;e his company. Elegies and epi&s;tles are very fine to tho&s;e to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed; and as for epic poems, I am generally able to di&s;cover the whole plan in read|ing the two fir&s;t pages.</P>
<P>Tragedies, however, as they are now made, are good in&s;tructive moral <HI>&s;ermons</HI> enough; and it would be a fault not to be plea&s;ed with <HI>good things.</HI> There I learn &s;everal great truths; as, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee into the ways of futurity; that
<PB N="134" REF="142">
puni&s;hment always attends the villain, that love is the fond &s;oother of the human brea&s;t, that we &s;hould not re&s;i&s;t heaven's will, for in re&s;i&s;ting hea|ven's will, heaven's will is re&s;i&s;ted; with &s;everal other &s;entiments equally new, delicate and &s;triking. Every new tragedy therefore I &s;hall go to &s;ee; for reflections of this nature make a tolerable har|mony, when mixed up with a proper quantity of drum, trumpet, thunder, lightening, or the &s;cene &s;hifter's whi&s;tle.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XCV.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, fir&s;t pre&s;ident of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD &s;ome intentions lately of going to vi&s;it Bedlam, the place where tho&s;e who go mad are confined. I went to wait upon the man in black to be my conductor, but I found him preparing to go to We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, where the Engli&s;h hold their courts of Ju&s;tice. It gave me &s;ome &s;urprize to find my friend engaged in a law|&s;uit but more &s;o when he informed me that it had been depending for &s;everal years. <HI>How is it po&s;|&s;ible,</HI> cried I, <HI>for a man who knows the world to go to law; I am well acquainted with the courts of ju&s;tice in China, they re&s;emble rat-traps every one of them, nothing more ea&s;y to get in, but to get out again is at|tended with &s;ome d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">fficu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, and more cunning than rats are generally found to po&s;&s;e&s;s!</HI></P>
<P>Faith, replied my friend, I &s;hould not have gone to law, but that I was a&s;&s;ured of &s;ucce&s;s before I began; things were pre&s;ented to me in
<PB N="135" REF="143">
&s;o alluring a light, that I thought by barely de|claring my&s;elf a candidate for the prize, I had nothing more to do but to enjoy the fruits of the victory. Thus have I been upon the eve of an ima|ginary triumph every term the&s;e ten years, have travelled forward with victory ever in my view, but ever out of reach; however, at pre&s;ent I fancy we have hampered our antagoni&s;t in &s;uch a manner, that without &s;ome unfore&s;een demur, we &s;hall this very day lay him fairly on his back.</P>
<P><HI>If things be &s;o &s;ituated,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>I don't care if I attend you to the courts, and partake in the plea&s;ure of your &s;ucce&s;s. But prithee,</HI> continued I, as we &s;et forward, <HI>what rea&s;ons have you to think an af|fair at la&s;t concluded, which has given you &s;o many former di&s;appointments?</HI> My lawyer tells me, re|turned he, that I have Salkeld and Ventris &s;trong in my favour, and that there are no le&s;s then fif|teen ca&s;es in point. <HI>I under&s;tand,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>tho&s;e are two of your judges who have already declared their opinions.</HI> Pardon me, replied my friend, Salkeld and Ventris are lawyers who &s;ome hundred years ago gave their opinion on ca&s;es &s;imilar to mine; the&s;e opinions which make for me my lawyer is to cite, and tho&s;e opinions which look another way are cited by the lawyer employed by my antagoni&s;t; as I ob&s;erved, I have Salkeld and Ventris for me, he has Coke and Hales, for him, and he that has mo&s;t opinions is mo&s;t likely to carry his cau&s;e. <HI>But where is the nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> cried I, <HI>of prolonging a &s;uit by citing the opinions and reports of others, &s;ince the &s;ame good &s;en&s;e which determined lawyers in for|mer ages may &s;erve to guide your judges at this day. They at that time gave their opinions only from the light of rea&s;on, your judges have the &s;ame light at

pre&s;ent to direct them, let me even add a greater, as in former ages, there were many prejudices from which the pre&s;ent is happily free. If arguing from authorities be exploded from every other branch of learning, why &s;hould it be particularly adhered to in this? I plainly fore&s;ee how &s;uch a method of inve&s;|tigation mu&s;t embarra&s;s every &s;uit, and even perplex the &s;tudent, ceremonies will be multiplied, formali|ties mu&s;t encrea&s;e, and more time will thus be &s;pent in learning the arts of litigation than in the di&s;covery of right.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ee, cries my friend, that you are for a &s;peedy admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, but all the world will grant that the more time that is taken up in con&s;ider|ing any &s;ubject the better it will be under&s;tood. Be&s;ides, it is the boa&s;t of an Engli&s;hman, that his property is &s;ecure, and all the world will grant that a deliberate admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice is the be&s;t way to <HI>&s;ecure his property.</HI> Why have we &s;o many lawyers, <HI>but to &s;ecure our property,</HI> why &s;o many formalities, but <HI>to &s;ecure our property?</HI> Not le&s;s than one hundred thou&s;and families live in op|pulence, elegance and ea&s;e, merely by <HI>&s;ecuring our property.</HI></P>
<P>To embarras ju&s;tice, returned I, by a multi|plicity of laws, or to hazard it by a confidence in our judges, are, I grant, the oppo&s;ite rocks on which legi&s;lative wi&s;dom has ever &s;plit; in one ca&s;e the client re&s;embles that Emperor, who is &s;aid to have been &s;uffocated with the bedcloaths, which were only de&s;igned to keep him warm; in the other, to that town which let the enemy take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of its walls, in order to &s;hew the world how little they depended upon aught but courage for

For in&s;tance, the catchpole watches the man in debt, the attorney watches the catchpole, the coun&s;ellor watches the attorney, the &s;olicitor the coun&s;ellor, and all find &s;ufficient employment. I conceive you, interrupt|ed I, they watch each other, but it is the client that pays them all for watching; it puts me in mind of a Chine&s;e Fable, which is entituled, <HI>Five animals at a meal.</HI></P>
<P>A gra&s;hopper filled with dew, was merrily &s;inging under a &s;hade; a whangam that eats gra&s;|hoppers had marked it for its prey, and was ju&s;t &s;tretching forth to devour it; a &s;erpent that had for a long time fed only on whangams, was coiled up to fa&s;ten on the whangam; a yellow bird was ju&s;t upon the wing to dart upon the &s;er|pent; a hawk had ju&s;t &s;tooped from above, to &s;eize the yellow bird; all were intent on their prey, and unmindful of their danger: So the whangam eat the gra&s;hopper, the &s;erpent eat the whangam, the yellow bird the &s;erpent, and the hawk the yellow bird; when &s;ou&s;ing from on high, a vulture gobbled up the hawk, gra&s;hop|per, whangam, and all in a moment.</P>
<P>I had &s;carce fini&s;hed my fable, when the law|yer came to inform my friend, that his cau&s;e was put off till another term, that money was wanted to retain, and that all the world was of opinion, that the very next hearing would bring him off victorious. If &s;o, then cries my friend, I believe
<PB N="138" REF="146">
it will be my wi&s;e&s;t way to continue the cau&s;e for another term, and in the mean time, my friend here and I will go and &s;ee Bedlam.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XCVI.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>I Lately received a vi&s;it from the little beau, who I found had a&s;&s;umed a new flow of &s;pirits with a new &s;uit of cloaths. Our di&s;cour&s;e hap|pened to turn upon the different treatment of the fair &s;ex here and in A&s;ia, with the influence of beauty in refining our manners and improving our conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I &s;oon perceived he was &s;trongly prejudiced in favour of the A&s;iatic method of treating the &s;ex, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade him, but that a man was happier who had four wives at his command, than he who had only one. "It is true, cries he, your men of fa&s;hion in the Ea&s;t are &s;laves, and under &s;ome terrors of having their throats &s;queezed by a bow-&s;tring; but what then, they can find ample con&s;olation in a &s;eraglio; they make indeed an indifferent figure in conver&s;ation abroad, but then they have a &s;eraglio to con&s;ole them at home. I am told they have no balls, drums, nor operas, but then they have got a &s;e|raglio; they may be deprived of wine and French cookery, but they have a &s;eraglio; a &s;eraglio, a &s;eraglio; my dear creature, wipes off every in|convenience in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="147" MS="y">"Be&s;ides, I am told, your A&s;iatic beauties are the mo&s;t convenient women alive, for they have no &s;ouls; po&s;itively there is nothing in nature I &s;hould like &s;o much as ladies without &s;ouls; &s;oul, here, is the utter ruin of half the &s;ex. A girl of eighteen &s;hall have &s;oul enough to &s;pend an hundred pounds in the turning of a trump. Her mother &s;hall have &s;oul enough to ride a &s;weep|&s;take match at an hor&s;e-race; her maiden aunt &s;hall have &s;oul enough to purcha&s;e the furniture of a whole toy &s;hop, and others &s;hall have &s;oul enough to behave as if they had no &s;ouls at all."</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;oul, interrupted I, the A&s;iatics are much kinder to the fair &s;ex than you imagine; in&s;tead of one &s;oul, Fohi the idol of China gives every woman three, the Bramines give them fifteen; and even Mahomet him&s;elf, no where excludes the &s;ex from Paradi&s;e. Abul|feda reports, that an old woman one day impor|tuning him to know what &s;he ought to do in order to gain Paradi&s;e? <HI>My good Lady,</HI> an&s;wered the Prophet, <HI>old women never get there</HI>; what, never get to Paradi&s;e, returned the matron, in a fury! Never, &s;ays he, for they always grow young by the way.</P>
<P>No, Sir, continued I, the men of A&s;ia behave with more deference to the &s;ex than you &s;eem to imagine. As you of Europe &s;ay grace, upon &s;it|ting down to dinner, &s;o it is the cu&s;tom in China to &s;ay grace, when a man goes to bed to his wife, <HI>And may I die,</HI> returned my companion, <HI>but a very pretty ceremony; for &s;eriou&s;ly, Sir, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why a man &s;hould not he as grateful in one &s;ituation as in the other. Upon honour, I always find my&s;elf much
<PB N="140" REF="148">
more di&s;po&s;ed to gratitude, on the couch of a fine wo|man, than upon &s;itting down to a &s;irloin of beef.</HI></P>
<P>Another ceremony, &s;aid I, re&s;uming the con|ver&s;ation, in favour of the &s;ex among&s;t us, is the bride's being allowed after marriage, <HI>her three days of freedom.</HI> During this interval a thou&s;and extravagancies are practi&s;ed by either &s;ex. The lady is placed upon the nuptial bed, and number|le&s;s monkey tricks are played round to divert her. One gentleman &s;mells her perfumed handkerchief. another attempts to untie her garters, a third pulls off her &s;hoe to play hunt the &s;lipper, ano|ther pretends to be an ideot, and endeavours to rai&s;e a laugh by grimacing; in the mean time, the gla&s;s goes bri&s;kly about, till ladies, gentlemen, wife, hu&s;band, and all are mixed together in one inundation of arrack punch.</P>
<P>"Strike me dumb, deaf, and blind, cried my companion, but very pretty; there's &s;ome &s;en&s;e in your Chine&s;e ladies conde&s;centions; but among us, you &s;hall &s;carce find one of the whole &s;ex that &s;hall hold her good humour for three days to|gether. No later than ye&s;terday I happened to &s;ay &s;ome civil things to a citizen's wife of my ac|quaintance, not becau&s;e I loved, but becau&s;e I had charity; and what do you think was the tender creature's reply! Only that &s;he dete&s;ted my pig|tail wig, high heeled &s;hoes, and &s;allow com|plexion. That is all. Nothing more! Yes, by the heavens, though &s;he was more ugly than an unpaint|ed actre&s;s, I found her more in&s;olent than a tho|rough bred woman of quality."</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="149">He was proceeding in this wild manner, when his invective was interrupted, by the man in black, who entered the apartment, introducing his neice, a young lady of exqui&s;ite beauty. Her very appearance was &s;ufficient to &s;ilence the &s;evere&s;t &s;atyri&s;t of the &s;ex; ea&s;y without pride, and free without impudence, &s;he &s;eemed capable of &s;up|plying every &s;en&s;e with plea&s;ure; her looks, her conver&s;ation were natural and uncon&s;trained; &s;he had neither been taught to langui&s;h nor ogle, to laugh without a je&s;t, or &s;igh without &s;orrow. I found that &s;he had ju&s;t returned from abroad, and had been conver&s;ant in the manners of the world. Curio&s;ity prompted me to a&s;k &s;everal que&s;tions, but &s;he declined them all. I own I never found my&s;elf &s;o &s;trongly prejudiced in favour of apparent merit before; and could willingly have prolonged our conver&s;ation, but the company after &s;ome time withdrew. Ju&s;t, however, be|fore the little beau took his leave he called me a&s;ide, and reque&s;ted I would change him a twenty pound bill, which as I was incapable of doing, he was contented with borrowing half a crown.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XCVII.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi to Hinpgo, by the way of Mo&s;cow.</HEAD>
<P>FEW virtues have been more prai&s;ed by mo|rali&s;ts, than genero&s;ity; every practical treati&s;e of Ethics tends to encrea&s;e our &s;en&s;ibility of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others, and to relax the gra&s;p of fru|gality.
<PB N="142" REF="150">
Philo&s;ophers that are poor, prai&s;e it be|cau&s;e they are gainers by its effects; and the opu|lent Seneca him&s;elf has written a treati&s;e on be|nefits, though he was known to give nothing away.</P>
<P>But among the many who have enforced the duty of giving, I'm &s;urpri&s;ed there are none to inculcate the ignominy of receiving, to &s;hew that by every favour we accept, we in &s;ome mea&s;ure forfeit our native freedom, and that a &s;tate of continual dependance on the genero&s;ity of others is a life of gradual deba&s;ement.</P>
<P>Were men taught to de&s;pi&s;e the receiving obliga|tions with the &s;ame force of rea&s;oning and declama|tion that they are in&s;tructed to confer them, we might then &s;ee every per&s;on in &s;ociety filling up the requi&s;ite duties of his &s;tation with chearful indu&s;try, neither relaxed by hope, nor &s;ullen from di&s;ap|pointment.</P>
<P>Every favour a man receives, in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;inks him below his dignity, and in proportion to the value of the benefit, or the frequency of its acceptance, he gives up &s;o much of his natural independance. He therefore, who thrives upon the unmerited bounty of another, if he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> any &s;en&s;ibility, &s;uffers the wor&s;t of &s;ervitude; the &s;hackled &s;lave may murmur without reproach, but the humble dependant is taxed with ingratitude upon every &s;ymptom of di&s;content; the one may rave round the walls of his cell, but the other lingers in all the &s;ilence of mental confinement. To encrea&s;e his di&s;tre&s;s, every new obligation but adds to the former load which kept the vi|gorous mind from ri&s;ing; till at la&s;t, ela&s;tic no
<PB N="143" REF="151">
longer, it &s;hapes it&s;elf to con&s;traint, and puts on habitual &s;ervility.</P>
<P>It is thus with the feeling mind; but there are &s;ome who, born without any &s;hare of &s;en&s;ibility, receive favour after favour, and &s;till cringe for more, who accept the offer of genero&s;ity with as little reluctance as the wages of merit, and even make thanks for pa&s;t benefits an indirect petition for new; &s;uch I grant can &s;uffer no deba&s;ement from dependance, &s;ince they were originally as vile as was po&s;&s;ible to be; dependance degrades only the ingenuous, but leaves the &s;ordid mind in pri&s;tine meanne&s;s. In this manner therefore long continued genero&s;ity is mi&s;placed, or it is injuri|ous; it either finds a man worthle&s;s, or it makes him &s;o; and true it is, that the per&s;on who is con|tented to be <HI>often</HI> obliged, ought not to have been obliged at all.</P>
<P>Yet while I de&s;cribe the meanne&s;s of a life of continued dependance, I would not be thought to include tho&s;e natural or political &s;ubordinations which &s;ub&s;i&s;t in every &s;ociety, for in &s;uch, tho' dependance is exacted from the inferior, yet the obligation on either &s;ide is mutual. The &s;on mu&s;t rely upon his parent for &s;upport, but the parent lies under the &s;ame obligations to give, that the other has to expect; the &s;ubordinate officer mu&s;t receive the commands of his &s;uperior, but for this obedience the former has a right to demand an intercour&s;e of favour; &s;uch is not the dependance I would depreciate, but that where every expected favour mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of mere be|nevolence in the giver, where the benefit can be kept without remor&s;e, or transferred without inju&s;tice. The character of a legacy-hunter, for in&s;tance is
<PB N="144" REF="152">
dete&s;table in &s;ome countries, and de&s;picable in all; this univer&s;al contempt of a man who infringes upon none of the laws of &s;ociety, &s;ome moral|i&s;ts have arraigned as a popular and unju&s;t pre|judice; never con&s;idering the nece&s;&s;ary degrada|tions a wretch mu&s;t undergo, who previou&s;ly ex|pects to grow rich by benefits without having either natural or &s;ocial claims to enforce his peti|tions.</P>
<P>But this intercour&s;e of benefaction and acknow|ledgement is often injurious even to the giver as well as the receiver; a man can gain but little knowledge of him&s;elf, or of the world, amid&s;t a circle of tho&s;e whom hope or gratitude has ga|thered round him; their uncea&s;ing humiliations mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily encrea&s;e his comparative magni|tude, for all men mea&s;ure their own abilities by tho&s;e of their company; thus being taught to over|rate his merit, he in reality le&s;&s;ens it; encrea&s;ing in confidence, but not in power, his profe&s;&s;ions end in empty boa&s;t, his undertakings in &s;hameful di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>It is perhaps one of the &s;evere&s;t misfortunes of the great, that they are, in general, obliged to live among men who&s;e real value is le&s;&s;ened by dependance, and who&s;e minds are en&s;laved by obligation. The humble companion may have at fir&s;t accepted patronage with generous views, but &s;oon he feels the mortifying influence of con|&s;cious inferiority, by degrees &s;inks into a flatterer, and from flattery at la&s;t degenerates into &s;tupid veneration. To remedy this the great often di&s;+mi&s;s their old dependants, and take new. Such changes are fal&s;ely imputed to levity, fal&s;ehood,
<PB N="145" REF="153">
or caprice, in the patron, &s;ince they may be more ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to the client's gradual deteriora|tion.</P>
<P>No, my &s;on, a life of independance is generally a life of virtue. It is that which fits the &s;oul for every generous flight of humanity, freedom, and friend&s;hip. To give &s;hould be our plea&s;ure, but to receive our &s;hame; &s;erenity, health, and afflu|ence attend the de&s;ire of ri&s;ing by labour; mi&s;ery, repentance, and di&s;re&s;pect that of &s;ucceeding by extorted benevolence; the man who can thank him&s;elf alone for the happine&s;s he enjoys is truly ble&s;t; and lovely, far more lovely the &s;turdy gloom of laborious indigence, than the fawning &s;imper of thriving adulation.

A &s;erpent, which, as the fa|ble ob&s;erves, is furni&s;hed with one head and many tails, is much more capable of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and ex|pedition, than another, which is furni&s;hed with but one tail and many heads.</P>
<P>Obvious as the&s;e truths are, the people of this country &s;eem in&s;en&s;ible of their force. Not &s;ati&s;|fied with the advantages of internal peace and opulence, they &s;till murmur at their governors, and interfere in the execution of their de&s;igns; as if they wanted to be &s;omething more than happy. But as the Europeans in&s;truct by argument, and the A&s;iatics mo&s;tly by narration, were I to addre&s;s them, I &s;hould convey my &s;entiments in the fol|lowing &s;tory.</P>
<P>Takupi had long been Prime Mini&s;ter of Ti|partala, a fertile country that &s;tretches along the we&s;tern confines of China. During his admini&s;tra|tion, whatever advantages could be derived from arts, learning, and commerce, were &s;een to ble&s;s the people; nor were the nece&s;&s;ary precautions of pro|viding for the &s;ecurity of the &s;tate forgotten. It often happens, however, that when men are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of all they want, they then begin to find tor|ment from imaginary afflictions, and le&s;&s;en their pre&s;ent enjoyments, by foreboding that tho&s;e enjoyments are to have an end. The people now therefore endeavoured to find out grievances;
<PB N="147" REF="155">
and after &s;ome &s;earch, actually began to think them&s;elves aggrieved. A petition again&s;t the enor|mities of Takupi was carried to the throne in due form; and the Queen who governed the country, willing to &s;atisfy her &s;ubjects, appointed a day, in which his accu&s;ers &s;hould be heard, and the Mini&s;|ter &s;hould &s;tand upon his defence.</P>
<P>The day being arrived, and the Mini&s;ter brought before the tribunal, a carrier, who &s;upplied the city with fi&s;h, appeared among the number of his accu&s;ers. He exclaimed, that it was the cu&s;tom, time immemorial, for carriers to bring their fi&s;h upon an hor&s;e in a hamper; which being placed on one &s;ide, and balanced by a &s;tone on the other, was thus conveyed with ea&s;e and &s;afety: but that the pri&s;oner, moved either by a &s;pirit of innova|tion, or perhaps bribed by the hamper-makers, had obliged all carriers to u&s;e the &s;tone no longer, but balance one hamper with another; an order entirely repugnant to the cu&s;toms of all antiquity, and tho&s;e of the kingdom of Tipartala in particular.</P>
<P>The carrier fini&s;hed; and the whole court &s;hook their heads at the innovating Mini&s;ter: when a &s;e|cond witne&s;s appeared. He was in&s;pector of the city buildings, and accu&s;ed the di&s;graced favourite of having given orders for the demolition of an an|cient ruin, which ob&s;tructed the pa&s;&s;age thro' one of the principal &s;treets. He ob&s;erved, that &s;uch buildings were noble monuments of barbarous antiquity; contributed finely to &s;hew how little their ance&s;tors under&s;tood of architecture: and for that rea&s;on &s;uch monuments &s;hould be held &s;acred, and &s;uffered gradually to decay.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="156">The la&s;t witne&s;s now appeared. This was a widow, who had laudably attempted to burn her|&s;elf upon her hu&s;band's funeral pile. But the in|novating mini&s;ter had prevented the execution of her de&s;ign, and was in&s;en&s;ible to her tears, prote&s;|tations, and entreaties.</P>
<P>The Queen could have pardoned the two for|mer offences; but this la&s;t was con&s;idered as &s;o gro&s;s an injury to the &s;ex, and &s;o directly contrary to all the cu&s;toms of antiquity, that it called for immediate ju&s;tice. "What, cried the Queen, not &s;uffer a woman to burn her&s;elf when &s;he thinks proper? The &s;ex are to be very prettily tu|tored, no doubt, if they mu&s;t be re&s;trained from entertaining their female friends now and then with a fried wife, or roa&s;ted acquaintance. I &s;en|tence the criminal to be bani&s;hed my pre&s;ence for ever for his injurious treatment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ex."</P>
<P>Takupi had been hitherto &s;ilent, and &s;poke only to &s;hew the &s;incerity of his re&s;ignation. "Great Queen, cried he, I acknowledge my crime; and &s;ince I am to be bani&s;hed, I beg it may be to &s;ome ruined town, or de&s;olate village in the coun|try I have governed. I &s;hall find &s;ome plea&s;ure in improving the &s;oil, and bringing back a &s;pirit of indu&s;try among the inhabitants." His reque&s;t ap|pearing rea&s;onable, it was immediately complied with; and a courtier had orders to fix upon a place of bani&s;hment, an&s;wering the Mini&s;ter's de|&s;cription. After &s;ome months &s;earch, however, the enquiry proved fruitle&s;s; neither a de&s;olate vil|lage, nor a ruined town, was found in the whole kingdom. <HI>Alas,</HI> &s;aid Takupi then to the Queen, <HI>How can that country be ill governed which has neither a

de&s;olate village, nor a ruined town in it?</HI> The Queen perceived the ju&s;tice of his expo&s;tulation, and the Mini&s;ter was received into more than former fa|vour.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XCIX.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>THE ladies here are by no means &s;uch ardent game&s;ters as the women of A&s;ia. In this re|&s;pect I mu&s;t do the Engli&s;h ju&s;tice; for I love to prai&s;e where applau&s;e is ju&s;tly merited. Nothing more common in China, than to &s;ee two women of fa&s;hion continue gaming till one has won all the other's cloaths, and &s;tripped her quite naked; the winner thus marching off in a double &s;uit of finery, and the lo&s;er &s;hrinking behind in the primitive &s;im|plicity of nature.</P>
<P>No doubt, you remember when <HI>Shang,</HI> our maiden aunt, played with a &s;harper. Fir&s;t her money went; then her trinkets were produced; her cloaths followed piece by piece &s;oon after; when &s;he had thus played her&s;elf quite naked, be|ing a woman of &s;pirit, and willing to pur&s;ue <HI>her own,</HI> &s;he &s;taked her teeth; fortune was again&s;t her even here, and her teeth followed her cloaths; at la&s;t &s;he played for her left eye, and, oh, hard fate, this too &s;he lo&s;t: however, &s;he had the con&s;olation of biting the &s;harper, for he never per|ceived
<PB N="150" REF="158">
that it was made of gla&s;s till it became his own.</P>
<P>How happy, my friend, are the Engli&s;h ladies, who never ri&s;e to &s;uch an inordinance of pa&s;&s;ion! Though the &s;ex here are naturally fond of games of chance, and are taught to manage games of &s;kill from their infancy, yet they never pur&s;ue ill for|tune with &s;uch amazing intrepidity. Indeed I may entirely acquit them of ever playing&mdash;I mean of playing for their eyes or their teeth.</P>
<P>It is true, they often &s;take their fortune, their beauty, health, and reputations at a gaming-table. It even &s;ometimes happens, that they play their hu&s;bands into a jail; yet &s;till they pre&s;erve a deco|rum unknown to our wives and daughters of Chi|na. I have been pre&s;ent at a route in this country, where a woman of fa&s;hion, after lo&s;ing her money, has &s;at writhing in all the agonies of bad luck; and yet, after all, never once attempted to &s;trip a &s;in|gle petticoat, or cover the board, as her la&s;t &s;take, with her head-cloaths.</P>
<P>However, though I prai&s;e their moderation at play, I mu&s;t not conceal their a&s;&s;iduity. In China our women, except upon &s;ome great days, are ne|ver permitted to finger a dice-box; but here every day &s;eems to be a fe&s;tival; and night it&s;elf, which gives others re&s;t, only &s;erves to encrea&s;e the female game&s;ter's indu&s;try. I have been told of an old lady in the country, who being given over by the phy&s;icians, played with the curate of her pari&s;h to pa&s;s the time away: having won all his money, &s;he next propo&s;ed playing for her funeral charges; the
<PB N="151" REF="159">
propo&s;al was accepted; but unfortunately the lady expired ju&s;t as &s;he had taken in her game.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome pa&s;&s;ions, which though dif|ferently pur&s;ued, are attended with equal con&s;e|quences in every country: here they game with more per&s;everance, there with greater fury; here they &s;trip their families, there they &s;trip them&s;elves naked. A lady in China, who indulges a pa&s;&s;ion for gaming, often becomes a drunkard; and by flouri&s;hing a dice-box in one hand, &s;he generally comes to brandi&s;h a dram cup in the other. Far be it from me to &s;ay there are any who drink drams in England; but it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that when a lady has lo&s;t every thing el&s;e but her honour, &s;he wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">l be apt to to&s;s that into the bargain; and grown in&s;en&s;ible to nicer feelings, behave like the Spa|niard, who, when all his money was gone, endea|voured to borrow more, by offering to pawn his whi&s;ker.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER C.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi to ***, Merchant in Am&s;terdam.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t received a letter from my &s;on, in which he informs me of the fruitle&s;sne&s;s of his endeavours to recover the lady with whom he fled from Per&s;ia. He &s;trives to cover under the appear|ance of fortitude a heart torn with anxiety and di&s;|appointment. I have offered little con&s;olation; &s;ince that but too frequently feeds the &s;orrow which it pretends to deplore, and &s;trengthens the
<PB N="152" REF="160">
impre&s;&s;ion, which nothing but the external rubs of time and accident can thoroughly efface.</P>
<P>He informs me of his intentions of quitting Mo&s;cow the fir&s;t opportunity, and travelling by land to Am&s;terdam. I mu&s;t therefore, upon his ar|rival, entreat the continuance of your friend&s;hip; and beg of you to provide him with proper di|rections for finding me in London. You can &s;carcely be &s;en&s;ible of the joy I expect upon &s;eeing him once more: the ties between the father and the &s;on among us of China are much more clo&s;ely drawn than with you of Europe.</P>
<P>The remittances &s;ent me from Argun to Mo&s;cow came in &s;afety. I cannot &s;ufficiently admire that &s;pirit of hone&s;ty, which prevails through the whole country of Siberia: perhaps the &s;avages of that de&s;olate region are the only untutored people of the globe, that cultivate the moral virtues, even without knowing that their actions merit prai&s;e. I have been told &s;urpri&s;ing things of their good|ne&s;s, benevolence, and genero&s;ity; and the unin|terrupted commerce between China and Ru&s;&s;ia &s;erves as a collateral confirmation.</P>
<P><HI>Let us,</HI> &s;ays the Chine&s;e law-giver, <HI>admire the rude virtues of the ignorant, but rather imitate the delicate morals of the polite.</HI> In the country where I re&s;ide, though hone&s;ty and benevolence be not &s;o conge|nial; yet art &s;upplies the place of nature. Though here every vice is carried to exce&s;s; yet every vir|tue is practi&s;ed al&s;o with unexampled &s;uperiority. A city like this is the &s;oil for great virtues and great vices; the villain can &s;oon improve here in the
<PB N="153" REF="161" MS="y">
deepe&s;t my&s;teries of deceiving; and the practical philo&s;opher can every day meet new incitements to mend his hone&s;t intentions. There are no plea|&s;ures, &s;en&s;ual or &s;entimental, which this city does not produce; yet, I know not how, I could not be content to re&s;ide here for life. There is &s;omething &s;o &s;educing in that &s;pot in which we fir&s;t had ex|i&s;tence, that nothing but it can plea&s;e; whatever vici&s;&s;itudes we experience in life, however we toil, or where&s;oever we wander, our fatigued wi&s;hes &s;till recur to home for tranquillity, we long to die in that &s;pot which gave us birth, and in that plea&s;ing expectation opiate every calamity.</P>
<P>You now therefore perceive that I have &s;ome intentions of leaving this country; and yet my de|&s;igned departure fills me with reluctance and re|gret. Though the friend&s;hips of travellers are generally more tran&s;ient than vernal &s;nows, &s;till I feel an unea&s;ine&s;s at breaking the connections I have formed &s;ince my arrival; particularly I &s;hall have no &s;mall pain in leaving my u&s;ual compa|nion, guide, and in&s;tructor.</P>
<P>I &s;hall wait for the arrival of my &s;on before I &s;et out. He &s;hall be my companion in every intended journey for the future; in his company I can &s;up|port the fatigues of the way with redoubled ar|dour, plea&s;ed at once with conveying in&s;truction, and exacting obedience.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CI.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, fir&s;t pre&s;ident of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>OUR &s;cholars of China have a mo&s;t profound veneration for forms. A fir&s;t rate beauty never &s;tudied the decorums of dre&s;s with more a&s;&s;iduity; they may properly enough be &s;aid to be cloathed with wi&s;dom from head to foot; they have their philo&s;ophical caps and philo&s;ophical whi&s;kers, their philo&s;ophical &s;lippers and philo&s;ophical fans; there is even a philo&s;ophical &s;tandard for mea&s;uring the nails; and yet, with all this &s;eeming wi&s;dom, they are often found to be mere empty pretenders.</P>
<P>A philo&s;ophical beau is not &s;o frequent in Eu|rope; yet I am told that &s;uch characters are found here. I mean &s;uch as punctually &s;upport all the decorums of learning, without being really very profound, or naturally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fine under|&s;tanding; who labour hard to obtain the titular honours attending literary merit; who flatter others, in order to be flattered in turn; and only &s;tudy to be thought &s;tudents.</P>
<P>A character of this kind generally receives com|pany in his &s;tudy, in all the pen&s;ive formality of &s;lippers, night-gown, and ea&s;y chair. The table is covered with a large book, which is always kept open, and never read; his &s;olitary hours being dedicated to dozing, mending pens, feel|ing his pul&s;e, peeping through the micro&s;cope, and &s;ometimes reading amu&s;ing books, which he condemns in company. His library is pre&s;erved
<PB N="155" REF="163">
with the mo&s;t religious neatne&s;s; and is generally a repo&s;itory of &s;carce books, which bear an high price, becau&s;e too dull or u&s;ele&s;s to become com|mon by the ordinary methods of publication.</P>
<P>Such men are generally candidates for admit|tance into literary clubs, academies, and in&s;ti|tutions, where they regularly meet to give and receive a little in&s;truction and a great deal of prai&s;e. In conver&s;ation they never betray ignorance, be|cau&s;e they never &s;eem to receive information. Offer a new ob&s;ervation, they have heard it before; pinch them in an argument, and they reply with a &s;neer.</P>
<P>Yet how trifling &s;oever the&s;e little arts may appear, they an&s;wer one valuable purpo&s;e, of gain|ing the practi&s;ers the e&s;teem they wi&s;h for. The bounds of a man's knowledge are ea&s;ily concealed, if he has but prudence; but all can readily &s;ee and admire a gilt library, a &s;et of long nails, a &s;ilver &s;tandi&s;h, or a well-combed whi&s;ker, who are inca|pable of di&s;tingui&s;hing a dunce.</P>
<P>When Father Matthew, the fir&s;t European Mi&s;&s;i|oner, entered China, the court was informed, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great &s;kill in a&s;tronomy; he was there|fore &s;ent for, and examined. The e&s;tabli&s;hed a&s;tro|nomers of &s;tate undertook this ta&s;k; and made their report to the Emperor, that his &s;kill was but very &s;u|perficial, and no way comparable to their own. The Mi&s;&s;ioner, however, appealed from their judg|ment to experience, and challenged them to cal|culate an eclip&s;e of the moon that was to happen a few nights following. "What, &s;aid &s;ome, &s;hall a Barbarian, without nails, pretend to vie with
<PB N="156" REF="164">
men in a&s;tronomy, who have made it the &s;tudy of their lives, with men who know half the know|able characters of words, who wear &s;cientifical caps and &s;lippers, and who have gone through every literary degree with applau&s;e?" They accepted the challenge, confident of &s;ucce&s;s. The eclip&s;e began; the Chine&s;e produced a mo&s;t &s;plendid apparatus, and were fifteen minutes wrong; the Mi&s;&s;ioner, with a &s;ingle in&s;trument, was exact to a &s;econd. This was convincing; but the court a&s;tronomers were not to be convinced; in&s;tead of acknowledging their error, they a&s;&s;ured the Emperor, that their calcula|tions were certainly exact, but that the &s;tranger, without nails, had actually bewitched the moon. <HI>Well then,</HI> cries the good Emperor, &s;miling at their ignorance, <HI>you &s;hall &s;till continue to be &s;ervants of the moon; but I con&s;titute this man her Controller.</HI></P>
<P>China is thus replete with men, who&s;e only preten&s;ions to knowledge ari&s;e from external cir|cum&s;tances; and in Europe every country abounds with them in proportion to its ignorance. Spain and Flanders, who are behind the re&s;t of Europe in learning, at lea&s;t three centuries, have twenty literary titles and marks of di&s;tinction unknown in France or England: they have their <HI>Clari&s;&s;imi</HI> and <HI>Preclari&s;&s;imi,</HI> their <HI>Accurat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;imi</HI> and <HI>Minuti&s;&s;i|mi</HI>; a Round cap entitles one &s;tudent to argue, and a Square cap permits another to teach; while a cap with a To&s;&s;el, almo&s;t &s;anctifies the head it happens to cover. But where true knowledge is cultivated, the&s;e formalities begin to di&s;appear; the ermin'd cowl, the &s;olemn beard, and &s;weeping train are laid a&s;ide; philo&s;ophers dre&s;s, and talk, and think like other men; and lamb-&s;kin dre&s;&s;ers, and cap-makers, and tail-carriers, now deplore a literary</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="165">For my own part, my friend, I have &s;een enough of pre&s;uming ignorance, never to venerate wi&s;dom but where it actually appears.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CII.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, fir&s;t pre&s;ident of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>THE time for the young King's coronation ap|proaches; the great and the little world look forward with impatience. A knight, from the country, who has brought up his family to &s;ee, and be &s;een on this occa&s;ion, has taken all the lower part of the hou&s;e where I lodge. His wife is laying in a large quantity of &s;ilks, which the mercer tells her are to be fa&s;hionable next &s;ea&s;on; and Mi&s;s, her daughter, has actually had her ears bored previous to the ceremony. In all this bu&s;tle of preparation I am con&s;idered as mere lumber, and have been &s;hoved up two &s;tories higher to make room for others my landlady &s;eems perfectly convinced are my betters; but whom, before me, &s;he is contented with only calling very good company.</P>
<P>The little beau, who has now forced him&s;elf into my intimacy, was ye&s;terday giving me a mo&s;t minute detail of the intended proce&s;&s;ion. All men are eloquent upon their favourite topic; and this &s;eemed peculiarly adapted to the &s;ize and turn of his under&s;tanding. His whole mind was blazoned over with a variety of glittering images; coronets,
<PB N="158" REF="166">
e&s;cutcheons, lace, fringe, ta&s;&s;els, &s;tones, bugles, and &s;pun gla&s;s. "Here, cried he, Garter is to walk; and there Rouge Dragon marches with the e&s;cutcheons on his back. Here Clarencieux moves forward; and there Blue Mantle di&s;dains to be left behind. Here the Aldermen march two and two; and there the undaunted Champion of England, no way terrified at the very numerous appearance of gentlemen and ladies, rides forward in complete armour, and, with an intrepid air, throws down his glove. Ah, continued he, &s;hould any be &s;o hardy as to take up that fatal glove, and &s;o accept the challenge, we &s;hould &s;ee fine &s;port; the Cham|pion would &s;hew him no mercy; he would &s;oon teach him all his pa&s;&s;es with a witne&s;s. However, I am afraid we &s;hall have none willing to try it with him, upon the approaching occa&s;ion, for two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, becau&s;e his antagoni&s;t would &s;tand a chance of being killed in the &s;ingle combat; and &s;econdly, becau&s;e if he e&s;capes the Champi|on's arm, he would certainly be hanged for trea|&s;on. No, no, I fancy none will be &s;o hardy as to di&s;pute it with a Champion like him inured to arms; and we &s;hall probably &s;ee him prancing unmole&s;ted away, holding his bridle thus in one hand, and brandi&s;hing his dram cup in the other."</P>
<P>Some men have a manner of de&s;cribing, which only wraps the &s;ubject in more than former ob&s;cu|rity; thus I was unable, with all my companion's volubility, to form a di&s;tinct idea of the intended proce&s;&s;ion. I was certain, that the inauguration of a King &s;hould be conducted with &s;olemnity and re|ligious awe; and I could not be per&s;uaded that there was much &s;olemnity in this de&s;cription. If this be true, cried I to my&s;elf, the people of Eu|rope
<PB N="159" REF="167">
&s;urely have a &s;trange manner of mixing &s;o|lemn and fanta&s;tic images together; pictures at once replete with burle&s;que and the &s;ublime. At a time when the King enters into the mo&s;t &s;olemn compact with his people, nothing &s;urely &s;hould be admitted to dimini&s;h from the real Maje&s;ty of the ceremony. A ludicrous image brought in at &s;uch a time throws an air of ridicule upon the whole. It &s;ome way re&s;embles a picture I have &s;een, de|&s;igned by Albert Durer, where, amid&s;t all the &s;o|lemnity of that aweful &s;cene, a deity judging, and a trembling world awaiting the decree, he has intro|duced a merry mortal trundling his &s;colding wife to hell in a wheel-barrow.</P>
<P>My companion, who mi&s;took my &s;ilence, during this interval of reflection, for the rapture of a&s;to|ni&s;hment, proceeded to de&s;cribe tho&s;e frivolous parts of the &s;hew, that mo&s;tly &s;truck his imagination; and to a&s;&s;ure me, that if I &s;tayed in this country &s;ome months longer I &s;hould &s;ee fine things. "For my own part, continued he, I know already of fifteen &s;uits of cloaths, that would &s;tand on one end with gold lace, all de&s;igned to be fir&s;t &s;hewn there; and as for diamonds, rubies, emeralds and pearls, we &s;hall &s;ee them as thick as bra&s;s nails in a &s;edan chair. And then we are all to walk &s;o maje&s;tical|ly thus; this foot always behind the foot before. The ladies are to fling no&s;egays; the court poets to &s;catter ver&s;es; the &s;pectators are to be all in full dre&s;s; Mrs. Tibbs, in a new &s;acque, ruffles, and frenched hair; look where you will, one thing finer than another; Mrs. Tibbs curte&s;ies to the Duche&s;s; her Grace returns the compliment with a bow. Lar|ge&s;s, cries the Herald. Make room cries the Gen|tleman U&s;her. Knock him down, cries the guard.
<PB N="160" REF="168">
Ah, continued he, amazed at his own de&s;cription, what an a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cene of grandeur can art pro|duce from the &s;malle&s;t circum&s;tance, when it thus actually turns to wonder one man putting on an|other man's hat."</P>
<P>I now found his mind was entirely &s;et upon the fopperies of the pageant, and quite regardle&s;s of the real meaning of &s;uch co&s;tly preparations. <HI>Pa|geants,</HI> &s;ays Bacon, <HI>are pretty things; but we &s;hould rather &s;tudy to make them elegant than expensive.</HI> Pro|ce&s;&s;ions, cavalcades, and all that fund of gay frip|pery, furni&s;hed out by taylors, barbers, and tire-women, mechanically influence the mind into ve|neration: an Emperor, in his night-cap, would not meet with half the re&s;pect of an Emperor with a glittering crown. Politics re&s;emble religion; at|tempting to dive&s;t either of ceremony, is the mo&s;t certain method of bringing either into contempt. The weak mu&s;t have their inducements to admira|tion as well as the wi&s;e; and it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;en&s;ible government to impre&s;s all ranks with a &s;en&s;e of &s;ubordination, whether this be effected by a diamond buckle, or a virtuous edict, a &s;umptuary law, or a gla&s;s necklace.</P>
<P>This interval of reflection only gave my compa|nion &s;pirits to begin his de&s;cription afre&s;h; and as a greater inducement to rai&s;e my curio&s;ity, he in|formed me of the va&s;t &s;ums that were given by the &s;pectators for places. "That the ceremony mu&s;t be fine, cries he, is very evident from the fine price that is paid for &s;eeing it. Several ladies have a&s;|&s;ured me, they could willingly part with one eye, rather than be prevented from looking on with the other. Come, come, continues he, I have a friend,
<PB N="161" REF="169">
who, for my &s;ake, will &s;upply us with places at the mo&s;t rea&s;onable rates; I'll take care you &s;hall not be impo&s;ed upon; and he will inform you of the u&s;e, finery, rapture, &s;plendour, and enchant|ment of the whole ceremony better than I."</P>
<P>Follies often repeated lo&s;e their ab&s;urdity, and a&s;&s;ume the appearance of rea&s;on: his arguments were &s;o often and &s;o &s;trongly enforced, that I had actually &s;ome thoughts of becoming a &s;pectator. We accordingly went together to be&s;peak a place; but gue&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e, when the man demanded a pur&s;e of gold for a &s;ingle &s;eat: I could hardly be|lieve him &s;erious upon making the demand. "Pri|thee, friend, cried I, after I have paid twenty pounds for &s;itting here an hour or two, can I bring a part of the Coronation back?" <HI>No, Sir.</HI> "How long can I live upon it after I have come away?" <HI>Not long, Sir.</HI> "Can a Coronation cloath, feed, or fatten me?" <HI>Sir,</HI> replied the man, <HI>you &s;eem to be under a mi&s;take; all that you can bring away is the plea&s;ure of having it to &s;ay, that you &s;aw the Corona|tion.</HI> "Bla&s;t me, cries Tibbs, if that be all, there's no need of paying for that, &s;ince I am re|&s;olved to have that plea&s;ure, whether I am there or no!"</P>
<P>I am con&s;cious, my friend, that this is but a very confu&s;ed de&s;cription of the intended ceremony. You may object, that I neither &s;ettle rank, prece|dency, nor place; that I &s;eem ignorant whether Gules walks before or behind Garter; that I have neither mentioned the dimen&s;ions of a Lord's cap, nor mea&s;ured the length of a Lady's tail. I know your delight is in minute de&s;cription; and this I am unhappily di&s;qualified from furni&s;hing; yet,

<P>IT was formerly the cu&s;tom here, when men of di&s;|tinction died, for their &s;urviving acquaintance to throw each a &s;light pre&s;ent into the grave. Several things of little value were made u&s;e of for that pur|po&s;e; perfumes, reliques, &s;pices, bitter herbs, camo|mile, wormwood, and ver&s;es. This cu&s;tom how|ever is almo&s;t di&s;continued; and nothing but ver&s;es alone are now lavi&s;hed on &s;uch occa&s;ions; an ob|lation which they &s;uppo&s;e may be interred with the dead, without any injury to the living.</P>
<P>Upon the death of the great therefore, the poets and undertakers are &s;ure of employment. While one provides the long cloak, black &s;taff, and mourning coach, the other produces the pa&s;toral or elegy, the monody or apotheo&s;is. The nobility need be under no apprehen&s;ions, but die as fa&s;t as they think proper, the poet and undertaker are ready to &s;upply them; the&s;e can find metaphorical tears and family e&s;cutcheons at half an hour's warn|ing; and when the one has &s;oberly laid the body in the grave, the other is ready to fix it figuratively among the &s;tars.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="171">There are &s;everal ways of being poetically &s;or|rowful on &s;uch occa&s;ions. The bard is now &s;ome pen&s;ive youth of &s;cience, who &s;its deploring among the tombs; again he is Thyr&s;is, complaining in a circle of harmle&s;s &s;heep. Now Britannia &s;its upon her own &s;hore, and gives a loo&s;e to maternal ten|derne&s;s; at another time, Parna&s;&s;us, even the mountain Parna&s;&s;us, gives way to &s;orrow, and is bathed in tears of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t u&s;ual manner is this: Damon meets Menalcas, who has got a mo&s;t gloomy counte|nance. The &s;hepherd a&s;ks his friend, whence that look of di&s;tre&s;s? to which the other replies, that Pollio is no more. If that be the ca&s;e then, cries Damon, let us retire to yonder bower at &s;ome di&s;|tance off, where the cypre&s;s and the je&s;&s;amine add fragrance to the breeze; and let us weep alternate|ly for Pollio, the friend of &s;hepherds, and the pa|tron of every mu&s;e. Ah, returns his fellow &s;hep|herd, what think you rather of that grotto by the fountain &s;ide; the murmuring &s;tream will help to a&s;&s;i&s;t our complaints, and a nightingale on a neighbouring tree will join her voice to the con|cert. When the place is thus &s;ettled, they begin: the brook &s;tands &s;till to hear their lamentations; the cows forget to graze; and the very tygers &s;tart from the fore&s;t with &s;ympathetic concern. By the tombs of our ance&s;tors, my dear Fum, I am quite unaffected in all this di&s;tre&s;s: the whole is liquid laudanum to my &s;pirits; and a tyger of common &s;en&s;ibility has twenty times more tenderne&s;s than I.</P>
<P>But though I could never weep with the com|plaining &s;hepherd, yet I am &s;ometimes induced to
<PB N="164" REF="172">
pity the poet, who&s;e trade is thus to make Demi|gods and Heroes for a dinner. There is not in na|ture a more di&s;mal figure than a man who &s;its down to premeditated flattery; every &s;tanza he writes ta|citly reproaches the meanne&s;s of his occupation, till at la&s;t his &s;tupidity becomes more &s;tupid, and his dullne&s;s more diminutive.</P>
<P>I am amazed therefore that none have yet found out the &s;ecret of flattering the worthle&s;s, and yet of pre&s;erving a &s;afe con&s;cience. I have often wi&s;hed for &s;ome method by which a man might do him&s;elf and his decea&s;ed patron ju&s;tice, without being un|der the hateful reproach of &s;elf-conviction. After long lucubration, I have hit upon &s;uch an expedi|ent; and &s;end you the &s;pecimen of a poem upon the decea&s;e of a great man, in which the flattery is perfectly fine, and yet the poet perfectly innocent.</P>

<P>IT is the mo&s;t u&s;ual method in every report, fir&s;t to examine its probability, and then act as the conjuncture may require. The Engli&s;h, however, exert a different &s;pirit in &s;uch circum&s;tances; they fir&s;t act, and, when too late, begin to examine. From a knowledge of this di&s;po&s;ition, there are &s;e|veral here who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to frame new reports at every convenient interval, all tending to denounce ruin both on their cotemporaries and their po&s;terity. This denunciation is eagerly caught up by the public; away they fling to propagate the di&s;tre&s;s; &s;ell out at one place, buy in at an|other, grumble at their governors, &s;hout in mobs, and when they have thus, for &s;ome time, behaved like fools, &s;it down coolly to argue and talk wi&s;|dom, to puzzle each other with &s;yllogi&s;m, and prepare for the next report that prevails, which is always attended with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="174">Thus are they ever ri&s;ing above one report only to &s;ink into another. They re&s;emble a dog in a well, pawing to get free. When he has rai&s;ed his upper parts above water, and every &s;pectator ima|gines him di&s;engaged, his lower parts drag him down again and &s;ink him to the no&s;e; he makes new efforts to emerge, and every effort increa&s;ing his weakne&s;s, only tends to &s;ink him the deeper.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome here, who, I am told, make a tolerable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by the credulity of their coun|trymen: as they find the public fond of blood, wounds and death, they contrive political ruins &s;uited to every month in the year; this month the people are to be eaten up by the French in flat-bot|tomed boats; the next by the &s;oldiers, de&s;igned to beat the French back; now the people are going to jump down the gulph of luxury; and now no|thing but an herring &s;ub&s;cription can fi&s;h them up again. Time pa&s;&s;es on; the report proves fal&s;e; new circum&s;tances produce new changes, but the people never change, they are per&s;evering in folly.</P>
<P>In other countries tho&s;e boding politicians would be left to fret over their own &s;chemes alone, and grow &s;plenetic without hopes of infecting others: But England &s;eems to be the very region where &s;pleen delights to dwell; a man not only can give an unbounded &s;cope to the di&s;order in him&s;elf, but may, if he plea&s;es, propagate it over the whole kingdom, with a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s. He has only to cry out, that the government, the government is all wrong, that their &s;chemes are leading to ruin, that Britons are no more, every good mem|ber of the commonwealth thinks it his duty, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, to deplore the univer&s;al decadence
<PB N="167" REF="175">
with &s;ympathetic &s;orrow, and, by fancying the con&s;titution in a decay, ab&s;olutely to impair its vigour.</P>
<P>This people would laugh at my &s;implicity, &s;hould I advi&s;e them to be le&s;s &s;anguine in harbour|ing gloomy predictions, and examine cooly before they attempted to complain I have ju&s;t heard a &s;tory, which, though tran&s;acted in a private fa|mily, &s;erves very well to de&s;cribe the behaviour of the whole nation, in ca&s;es of threatened calamity. As there are public, &s;o there are private incendi|aries here. One of the la&s;t, either for the amu&s;e|ment of his friends, or to divert a fit of the &s;pleen, lately &s;ent a threatening letter to a worthy family in my neighbourhood, to this effect.</P>
<P>"SIR, Knowing you to be very rich, and find|ing my&s;elf to be very poor, I think proper to in|form you, that I have learned the &s;ecret of poi&s;on|ing man, woman, and child, without danger of detection. Don't be unea&s;y, Sir, you may take your choice of being poi&s;oned in a fortnight, or poi&s;oned in a month, or poi&s;oned in &s;ix weeks; you &s;hall have full time to &s;ettle all your affairs. Though I'm poor, I love to do things like a gen|tleman. But, Sir, you mu&s;t die; I have determined it within my own brea&s;t that you mu&s;t die. Blood, Sir, blood is my trade; &s;o I could wi&s;h you would this day &s;ix weeks take leave of your friends, wife, and family, for I cannot po&s;&s;ibly allow you longer time. To convince you more certainly of the pow|er of my art, by which you may know I &s;peak truth, take this letter; when you have read it, tear off the &s;eal, fold it up, and give it to your favourite Dutch ma&s;tiff that &s;its by the fire, he will
<PB N="168" REF="176">
&s;wallow it, Sir, like a butter'd toa&s;t; in three hours four minutes after he has taken it, he will attempt to bite off his own tongue, and half an hour after bur&s;t a&s;under in twenty pieces. Blood, blood, blood; &s;o no more at pre&s;ent from, Sir, your mo&s;t obedient, mo&s;t devoted humble &s;ervant to command till death.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily imagine the con&s;ternation into which this letter threw the whole good natured family. The poor man, to whom it was addre&s;&s;|ed, was the more &s;urpri&s;ed, as not knowing how he could merit &s;uch inveterate malice. All the friends of the family were convened; it was uni|ver&s;ally agreed, that it was a mo&s;t terrible affair, and that the government &s;hould be &s;olicited to of|fer a reward and a pardon: a fellow of this kind would go on poi&s;oning family after family; and it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay where the de&s;truction would end. In pur&s;uance of the&s;e determinations the government was applied to; &s;trict &s;earch was made after the incendiary, but all in vain. At la&s;t, there|fore, they recollected that the experiment was not yet tried upon the dog; the Dutch ma&s;tiff was brought up, and placed in the mid&s;t of the friends and relations, the &s;eal was torn off, the pacquet folded up with care, and &s;oon they found to the great &s;urprize of all&mdash; that the dog would not eat the letter.</P>

<P>I HAVE frequently been amazed at the igno|rance of almo&s;t all the European travellers, who have penetrated any con&s;iderable way ea&s;tward into A&s;ia. They have been influenced either by motives of commerce or piety, and their accounts are &s;uch as might rea&s;onably be expected from men of very narrow or very prejudiced education, the dictates of &s;uper&s;tition or the re&s;ult of igno|rance. Is it not &s;urprizing, that in &s;uch a variety of adventurers not one &s;ingle philo&s;opher &s;hould be found; for as to the travels of Gemelli, the learned are long agreed that the whole is but an impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce any country how rude or in|cultivated &s;oever, where the inhabitants are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome peculiar &s;ecrets, either in nature or art, which might be tran&s;planted with &s;ucce&s;s; in Siberian Tartary, for in&s;tance, the natives extract a &s;trong &s;pirit from milk, which is a &s;ecret probably unknown to the chymi&s;ts of Eu|rope. In the mo&s;t &s;avage parts of India, they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ecret of dying vegetable &s;ub&s;tan|ces &s;carlet; and of refining lead into a metal which, for hardne&s;s and colour, is little inferior to &s;ilver; not one of which &s;ecrets but would in Eu|rope make a man's fortune. The power of the A&s;iatics in producing winds, or bringing down rain, the Europeans are apt to treat as fabulous,
<PB N="170" REF="178">
becau&s;e they have no in&s;tances of the like nature among them&s;elves; but they would have treated the &s;ecrets of gunpowder, and the mariner's com|pa&s;s, in the &s;ame manner, had they been told the Chine&s;e u&s;ed &s;uch arts before the invention was common with them&s;elves at home.</P>
<P>Of all the Engli&s;h philo&s;ophers I mo&s;t reverence <HI>Bacon,</HI> that great and hardy genius; he it is who allows of &s;ecrets yet unknown; who, undaunted by the &s;eeming difficulties that oppo&s;e, prompts human curio&s;ity to examine every part of nature, and even exhorts man to try whether he cannot &s;ubject the tempe&s;t, the thunder, and even earthquakes to hu|man controll: O did a man of his daring &s;pirit, of his genius, penetration, and learning travel to tho&s;e countries which have been vi&s;ited only by the &s;uper&s;titious and mercenary, what might not man|kind expect: how would he enlighten the regions to which he travelled! And what a variety of know|ledge and u&s;eful improvement would he not bring back in exchange!</P>
<P>There is probably no country &s;o barbarous, that would not di&s;clo&s;e all it knew, if it received from the traveller equivalent information; and I am apt to think, that a per&s;on, who was ready to give more knowledge than he received, would be wel|come wherever he came. All his care in travelling &s;hould only be to &s;uit his intellectual banquet to the people with whom he conver&s;ed; he &s;hould not at|tempt to teach the unlettered Tartar a&s;tronomy, nor yet in&s;truct the polite Chine&s;e in the ruder arts of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; he &s;hould endeavour to improve the Barbarian in the &s;ecrets of living comfortably; and the inhabitant of a more refined country in
<PB N="171" REF="179">
the &s;peculative plea&s;ures of &s;cience. How much more nobly would a philo&s;opher thus employed &s;pend his time, than by &s;itting at home earne&s;tly intent upon adding one &s;tar more to his catalogue; or one mon&s;ter more to his collection; or &s;till, if po&s;&s;ible, more triflingly &s;edulous in the incatena|tion of fleas, or the &s;culpture of a cherry-&s;tone.</P>
<P>I never con&s;ider this &s;ubject, without being &s;ur|prized how none of tho&s;e &s;ocieties &s;o laudably e&s;tabli&s;hed in England for the promotion of arts and learning, have never thought of &s;ending one of their members into the mo&s;t ea&s;tern parts of A&s;ia, to make what di&s;coveries he was able. To be convinced of the utility of &s;uch an undertaking, let them but read the relations of their own travel|lers. It will be there found, that they are as often deceived them&s;elves, as they attempt to de|ceive others. The merchants tells us perhaps the price of different commodities, the methods of baling them up, and the propere&s;t manner for an European to pre&s;erve his health in the country. The mi&s;&s;ioner, on the other hand, informs us, with what plea&s;ure the country to which he was &s;ent embraced chri&s;tianity, and the numbers he converted; what methods he took to keep Lent in a region where there was no fi&s;h, or the &s;hifts he made to celebrate the rites of his religion, in places where there was neither bread nor wine; &s;uch accounts, with the u&s;ual appendage of mar|riages and funerals, in&s;criptions, rivers, and moun|tains, make up the whole of an European travel|ler's diary; but as to all the &s;ecrets of which the inhabitants are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, tho&s;e are univer&s;ally at|tributed to magic; and when the traveller can give no other account of the wonders he &s;ees per|formed,
<PB N="172" REF="180">
he very contentedly a&s;cribes them to the power of the devil.</P>
<P>It was an u&s;ual ob&s;ervation of <HI>Boyle,</HI> the Engli&s;h chymi&s;t, that if every arti&s;t would but di&s;cover what new ob&s;ervations occurred to him in the exerci&s;e of his trade, philo&s;ophy would thence gain innumerable improvements. It may be ob|&s;erved, with &s;till greater ju&s;tice, that if the u&s;eful knowledge of every country, how&s;oever barbarous, was gleaned by a judicious ob&s;erver, the advan|tages would be ine&s;timable. Are there not even in Europe, many u&s;eful inventions known or prac|ti&s;ed, but in one place? The in&s;trument, as an ex|ample, for cutting down corn in Germany, is much more handy and expeditious, in my opinion, than the &s;ickle u&s;ed in England. The cheap and ex|peditious manner of making vinegar without pre|vious fermentation, is known only in a part of France. If &s;uch di&s;coveries therefore, remain &s;till to be known at home; what funds of knowledge might not be collected, in countries yet unex|plored, or only pa&s;&s;ed through by ignorant travel|lers in ha&s;ty caravans.</P>
<P>The caution with which foreigners are received in A&s;ia, may be alledged as an objection to &s;uch a de&s;ign. But how readily have &s;everal European merchants found admi&s;&s;ion into regions the mo&s;t &s;u&s;pecting, under the character of <HI>Sanjapins,</HI> or nor|thern pilgrims; to &s;uch not even China it&s;elf de|nies acce&s;s.</P>
<P>To &s;end out a traveller, properly qualified for the&s;e purpo&s;es, might be an object of national concern; it would in &s;ome mea&s;ure repair the
<PB N="173" REF="181">
breaches made by ambition; and might &s;hew that there were &s;till &s;ome who boa&s;ted a greater name than that of patriots, who profe&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves lovers of men. The only difficulty would remain in chu&s;ing a proper per&s;on, for &s;o arduous an enterprize. He &s;hould be a man of a philo&s;o|phical turn, one apt to deduce con&s;equences of general utility from particular occurrences, neither &s;wollen with pride, nor hardened by prejudice, nei|ther wedded to one particular &s;y&s;tem, nor in&s;truct|ed only in one particular &s;cience; neither wholly a botani&s;t, nor quite an antiquarian; his mind &s;hould be tinctured with mi&s;cellaneous knowledge, and his manners humanized by an intercour&s;e with men. He &s;hould be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an enthu|&s;ia&s;t to the de&s;ign; fond of travelling, from a rapid imagination, and an innate love of change; furni&s;h|ed with a body capable &s;u&s;taining every fatigue, and an heart not ea&s;ily terrified at danger.</P>

<P>ONE of the principal ta&s;ks I had propo&s;ed to my&s;elf on my arrival here, was to become acquainted with the names and characters of tho&s;e now living, who as &s;cholars or wits, had acquired the greate&s;t &s;hare of reputation. In order to &s;uc|ceed in this de&s;ign, I fancied the &s;ure&s;t method would be to begin my enquiry among the ignorant,

judging that his fame would be greate&s;t, which was loud enough to be heard by the vulgar. Thus predi&s;po&s;ed, I began the &s;earch, but only went in que&s;t of di&s;appointment and perplexity. I found every di&s;trict had a peculiar famous man of its own. Here the &s;tory-telling &s;hoemaker had en|gro&s;&s;ed the admiration on one &s;ide of the &s;treet, while the bellman, who excelleth at a catch, was in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the other. At one end of a lane the &s;exton was regarded as the greate&s;t man alive, but I had not travelled half its length, till I found an enthu&s;ia&s;t teacher had divided his reputation. My landlady perceiving my de&s;ign, was kind enough to offer me her advice in this affair. It was true, &s;he ob&s;erved, that &s;he was no judge, but &s;he knew what plea&s;ed her&s;elf, and if I would re&s;t upon her judgment, I &s;hould &s;et down Tom Collins as the mo&s;t ingenious man in the world, for Tom was able to take off all man|kind, and imitate be&s;ides a &s;ow and pigs to per|fection.</P>
<P>I now perceived, that taking my &s;tandard of reputation among the vulgar, would &s;well my ca|talogue of great names above the &s;ize of a Court Calendar, I therefore di&s;continued this method of pur&s;uit, and re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute my enquiry in that u&s;ual re&s;idence of fame, a book&s;eller's &s;hop. In con&s;equence of this I entreated the book&s;eller to let me know who were they who now made the greate&s;t figure either in morals, wit, or learning.

title, preface, plan, body, or index to be the com|plete&s;t hand in England. I found it was vain to pro&s;ecute my enquiry, where my informer ap|peared &s;o incompetent a judge of merit, &s;o paying for the <HI>Young Attorney's Guide,</HI> which good man|ners obliged me to buy, I walked off.</P>
<P>My pur&s;uit after famous men now brought me into a print &s;hop. Here, thought I, the painter only reflects the public voice. As every man who de|&s;erved it had formerly his &s;tatue placed up in the Roman forum, &s;o here probably the pictures of none but &s;uch as merit a place in our affections are held up for public &s;ale. But gue&s;s my &s;urprize when I came to examine this depo&s;itary of noted faces; all di&s;tinctions were levelled here, as in the grave, and I could not but regard it as the catacomb of real merit. The brick du&s;t man took up as much room as the truncheoned hero, and the judge was elbowed by the thieftaker; quacks, pimps, and buffoons encrea&s;ed the groupe, and noted &s;tallions only made room for more noted whores. I had read the works of &s;ome of the moderns previous to my coming to England, with delight and approbation, but I found their faces had no place here, the walls were covered with the names of authors I had never known, or had en|deavoured to forget; with the little &s;elf-adverti&s;ing things of a day who had forced them&s;elves into fa&s;hion, but not into fame; I could read at the bottom of &s;ome pictures, the names of * *, and * * *, and * * * *, all equally candidates for the vulgar &s;hout, and foremo&s;t to propagate their un|blu&s;hing faces upon bra&s;s. My unea&s;ine&s;s there|fore at not finding my few favourite names among the number was now changed into congratulation;
<PB N="176" REF="184">
I could not avoid reflecting on the fine ob&s;ervation of Tacitus on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion. In this cavalcade of flattery, cries the hi&s;torian, neither the pictures of Brutus, Ca&s;&s;ius, nor Cato, were to be &s;een, <HI>eo clariores quia imagines eorum non deferebantur,</HI> their ab&s;ence being the &s;tronge&s;t proof of their merit.</P>
<P>It is in vain, cried I, to &s;eek for true greatne&s;s among the&s;e monuments of the unburied dead; let me go among the tombs of tho&s;e who are con|fe&s;&s;edly famous, and &s;ee if any have been lately depo&s;ited there, who de&s;erve the attention of po&s;|terity, and who&s;e names may be tran&s;mitted to my di&s;tant friend, as an honour to the pre&s;ent age. Determined in my pur&s;uit, I paid a &s;econd vi&s;it to We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey. There I found &s;everal new monuments erected to the memory of &s;everal great men; the names of the great men I ab&s;o|lutely forget, but I well remember that Roubil|lac was the &s;tatuary who carved them. I could not help &s;miling at two modern epitaphs in particular; one of which prai&s;ed the decea&s;ed for being <HI>ortus ex antiqua &s;tirpe</HI>; the other commend|ed the dead, becau&s;e <HI>hanc aedem &s;uis &s;umptibus reaedificavit:</HI> the greate&s;t merit of one, con&s;i&s;ted in his being de&s;cended from an illu&s;trious hou&s;e; the chief di&s;tinction of the other, that he had propped up an old hou&s;e that was falling. Alas, alas, cried I, &s;uch monuments as the&s;e confer honour, not upon the great men, but upon little Roubillac.</P>
<P>Hitherto di&s;appointed in my enquiry after the great of the pre&s;ent age, I was re&s;olved to mix in company, and try what I could learn among critics in coffee-hou&s;es; and here it was that I heard my
<PB N="177" REF="185">
favourite names talked of even with inverted fame. A gentleman of exalted merit, as a writer, was branded in general terms as a bad man; another of exqui&s;ite delicacy as a poet was reproached for want|ing good nature; a third was accu&s;ed of free-think|ing; and a fourth of having once been a player. Strange, cried I, how unju&s;t are mankind in the di&s;tribution of fame; the ignorant among whom I &s;ought at fir&s;t, were willing to grant, but incapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing the virtues of tho&s;e which de|&s;erved it; among tho&s;e I now conver&s;e with, they know the proper objects of admiration, but mix envy with applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed &s;o often, I was now re&s;olved to examine tho&s;e characters in per&s;on of whom the world talked &s;o freely; by conver&s;ing with men of real merit I began to find out tho&s;e characters which really de&s;erved, though they &s;trove to avoid, applau&s;e. I found the vulgar admiration entirely mi&s;placed, and malevolence without its &s;ting. The truly great, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of numerous &s;mall faults, and &s;hining virtues, pre&s;erve a &s;ublime in morals as in writing. They who have attained an excellence in either, commit numberle&s;s trangre&s;&s;ions, ob&s;erv|able to the meane&s;t under&s;tanding. The ignorant critic and dull remarker can readily &s;py blemi&s;hes in eloquence or morals, who&s;e &s;entiments are not &s;ufficiently elevated to ob&s;erve a beauty; but &s;uch are judges neither of books nor of life; they can dimini&s;h no &s;olid reputation by their cen&s;ure, nor be&s;tow a la&s;ting character by their applau&s;e: In &s;hort, I found by my &s;earch, that &s;uch only can confer real fame upon others, who have merit them&s;elves to de&s;erve it.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CVII.</HI> To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are numberle&s;s employments in the courts of the Ea&s;tern Monarchs utterly un|practi&s;ed and unknown in Europe. They have no &s;uch officers, for in&s;tance, as the Emperor's ear-tickler, or tooth-picker; they have never introduced at the courts the Mandarine appointed to bear the royal tobacco-box, or the grave director of the imperial exercitations in the &s;eraglio. Yet I am &s;urprized that the Engli&s;h have imitated us in none of the&s;e particulars, as they are generally plea&s;ed with every thing that comes from China, and ex|ce&s;&s;ively fond of creating new and u&s;ele&s;s employ|ments. They have filled their hou&s;es with our furniture, their public gardens with our fire-works, and their very ponds with our fi&s;h; our courtiers, my friend, are the fi&s;h, and the furniture they &s;hould have imported; our courtiers would fill up the nece&s;&s;ary ceremonies of a court better than tho&s;e of Europe, would be contented with re|ceiving large &s;alaries for doing little, whereas &s;ome of this country are at pre&s;ent di&s;contented though they receive large &s;alaries for doing nothing.</P>
<P>I lately, therefore, had thoughts of publi&s;hing a propo&s;al here, for the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome new Ea&s;tern offices and titles into their court regi&s;ter. As I con&s;ider my&s;elf in the light of a Co&s;mopolite,

<PB N="179" REF="187">
I find as much &s;atisfaction in &s;cheming for the countries in which I happen to re&s;ide, as for that in which I was born.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t apartments in the palace of Pegu are frequently infe&s;ted with rats. The&s;e the religion of the country &s;trictly forbids the people to kill. In &s;uch circum&s;tances therefore they are obliged to have recour&s;e to &s;ome great man of the court, who is willing to free the royal apartments even at the hazard of his &s;alvation. After a weak Monarch's reign the quantity of court vermin in every corner of the palace is &s;urprizing, but a prudent king and a vigilant officer &s;oon drives them from their &s;anctu|aries behind the matts and the tape&s;try, and effec|tually frees the court. Such an officer in England would in my opinion be &s;erviceable at this juncture; for if, as I am told, the palace be old, much vermin mu&s;t undoubtedly have taken refuge behind the wain&s;cot and hangings. A mini&s;ter &s;hould therefore be inve&s;ted with the title and dignities of Court-vermin killer; he &s;hould have full power either to bani&s;h, take, poi&s;on or de&s;troy them, with enchantments, traps, ferrets, or rat&s;bane. He might be permitted to brandi&s;h his be&s;om without remor&s;e, and bru&s;h down every part of the furni|ture, without &s;paring a &s;ingle cobweb however &s;acred by long pre&s;cription. I communicated this propo&s;al &s;ome days ago in a company of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, and enjoying the mo&s;t honourable of|fices of the &s;tate. Among the number were the in|&s;pector of Great Britain, Mr. Henriques the Direc|tor of the Mini&s;try, Ben. Victor the Trea&s;urer, John Lockman the &s;ecretary, and the Conductor of the Imperial Magazine. They all acquie&s;ced
<PB N="180" REF="188">
in the utility of my propo&s;al, but were appre|hen&s;ive it might meet with &s;ome ob&s;tructions from court uphol&s;terers and chamber-maids, who would object to it from the demolition of the furniture, and the dangerous u&s;e of ferrets and rat&s;bane.</P>
<P>My next propo&s;al is rather more general than the former, and might probably meet with le&s;s oppo&s;ition. Though no people in the world flatter each other more than the Engli&s;h, I know none who under&s;tand the art le&s;s, and flatter with &s;uch little refinement. Their panegyric, like a Tartar fea&s;t, is indeed &s;erved up with profu&s;ion, but their cookery is in&s;upportable. A client here &s;hall dre&s;s up a frica&s;&s;ee for his patron, that &s;hall offend an ordinary no&s;e before it enters the room. A town &s;hall &s;end up their addre&s;s to a great mi|ni&s;ter, which &s;hall prove at once a &s;atire on the mini&s;ter and them&s;elves. If the favourite of the day &s;its, or &s;tands, or &s;leeps, there are poets to put it into ver&s;e, and prie&s;ts to preach it in the pulpit. In order therefore to free both tho&s;e who prai&s;e, and tho&s;e who are prai&s;ed from a duty probably di&s;agreeable to both, I would con&s;titute profe&s;&s;ed flatterers here as in &s;everal courts of In|dia. The&s;e are appointed in the courts of their princes, to in&s;truct the people where to exclaim with admiration, and where to lay an empha&s;is of prai&s;e. But an officer of this kind is always in waiting when the Emperor conver&s;es in a familiar manner among his Rajas and other nobility. At every &s;entence, when the Monarch pau&s;es, and &s;miles at what he has been &s;aying; the Karamat|man, as this officer is called, is to take it for
<PB N="181" REF="189">
granted, that his Maje&s;ty has &s;aid a good thing. Upon which he cries out Karamat! Karamat! a miracle, a miracle, and throws up his hands and his eyes in extacy. This is ecchoed by the cour|tiers around, while the Emperor &s;its all this time, in &s;ullen &s;atisfaction, enjoying the triumph of his joke, or &s;tudying a new repartee.</P>
<P>I would have &s;uch an officer placed at every great man's table in England. By frequent practice he might &s;oon become a perfect ma&s;ter of the art, and in time would turn out plea&s;ing to his patron, no way trouble&s;ome to him&s;elf, and might prevent the nau&s;eous attempts of many more ignorant pre|tenders. The clergy here, I am convinced, would reli&s;h this propo&s;al. It would provide places for &s;everal of them. And indeed by &s;ome of their late productions many appear to have qualified them&s;elves as candidates for this office already.</P>
<P>But my la&s;t propo&s;al I take to be of the ut|mo&s;t importance. Our neighbour the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia has, you may remember, in&s;tituted an order of female knighthood. The Empre&s;s of Germany has al&s;o in&s;tituted another; the Chine&s;e have had &s;uch an order time immemorial. I am amazed the Engli&s;h have never come into &s;uch an in&s;titution. When I con&s;ider what kind of men are made knights here, it appears &s;trange, that they have never conferred this honour upon women. They make chee&s;emongers and pa&s;trycooks Knights; then why not their wives? They have called up tallow chandlers to maintain the hardy profe&s;&s;ion of chivalry and arms; then why not their wives? Haberda&s;hers are &s;worn; as I &s;uppo&s;e all knights mu&s;t be &s;worn, <HI>never to fly in time of mellay or bat|tle,
<PB N="182" REF="190">
to maintain and uphold the noble e&s;tate of Chivalry, with hor&s;e harni&s;he and other Knightlye habiliments.</HI> Haberda&s;hers, I &s;ay, are &s;worn to all this, then why not their wives? Certain I am their wives under|&s;tand fighting and feats of mellay and battle better than they, and as for Knightlye hor&s;e and har|ni&s;he, it is probable both know nothing more than the harne&s;s of a one hor&s;e chai&s;e. No, no, my friend, in&s;tead of conferring any order upon the hu&s;bands, I would knight their wives. However the State &s;hould not be troubled with a new in&s;ti|tution upon this occa&s;ion. Some ancient exploded order might be revived, which would furni&s;h both a motto and a name, the ladies might be permitted to chu&s;e for them&s;elves. There are for in&s;tance the ob&s;olete orders of the <HI>Dragon</HI> in Germany, of the <HI>Rue</HI> in Scotland, and the <HI>Porcupine</HI> in France, all well &s;ounding names, and very applicable to my intended female in&s;titution.</P>

<P>RELIGIOUS Sects in England are far more numerous than in China. Every man who has intere&s;t enough to hire a conventicle here, may &s;et up for him&s;elf and &s;ell off a new religion. The &s;ellers of the newe&s;t pattern at pre&s;ent give ex|treme good bargains; and let their di&s;ciples have a great deal of <HI>confidence</HI> for very little money.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="191">Their &s;hops are much frequented, and their cu&s;|tomers every day encrea&s;ing, for people are na|turally fond of going to Paradi&s;e at as &s;mall ex|pence as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Yet you mu&s;t not conceive this modern &s;ect as differing in opinion from tho&s;e of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion: Difference of opinion indeed formerly divided their &s;ectaries, and &s;ometimes drew their armies to the field. White gowns and black mantles, &s;lapped hats and cro&s;s pocket holes were once the obvious cau&s;es of quarrel; men then had &s;ome rea&s;on for fighting, they knew what they fought about; but at pre&s;ent they are arrived at &s;uch refinement in religion-making, that they have actually formed a new &s;ect without a new opinion; they quarrel for opinions they both equally de|fend; they hate each other, and that is all the difference between them.</P>
<P>But though their principles are the &s;ame, their practice is &s;omewhat different. Tho&s;e of the e&s;|tabli&s;hed religion laugh when they are plea&s;ed, and their groans are &s;eldom extorted but by pain or danger. The new &s;ect, on the contrary, weep for their amu&s;ement, and u&s;e little mu&s;ic except a chorus of &s;ighs and groans, or tunes that are made to imitate groaning. Laughter is their aver&s;ion; lovers court each other from the lamentations; the bridegroom approaches the nuptial couch in &s;or|rowful &s;olemnity, and the bride looks more di&s;mal than an undertaker's &s;hop. Dancing round the room is with them running in a direct line to the devil; and as for gaming, though but in je&s;t, they would &s;ooner play with a rattle-&s;nake's tail, than finger a dice-box.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="192">By this time you perceive that I am de&s;cribing a &s;ect of Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and you have already compa|red them with the Faquirs, Bramins, and Talapoins of the Ea&s;t. Among the&s;e, you know, are gene|rations that have been never known to &s;mile, and voluntary affliction makes up all the merit they can boa&s;t of. Enthu&s;ia&s;ms in every country produce the &s;ame effects; &s;tick the Faquir with pins, or confine the Bramine to a vermine ho&s;pital, &s;pread the Talapoin on the ground, or load the Sectary's brow with contrition; tho&s;e wor&s;hipers who di&s;|card the light of rea&s;on, are ever gloomy; their fears encrea&s;e in proportion to their ignorance, as men are continually under apprehen&s;ions who walk in darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet there is &s;till a &s;tronger rea&s;on for the en|thu&s;ia&s;t's being an enemy to laughter, namely, his being him&s;elf &s;o proper an object of ridicule. It is remarkable that the propagators of fal&s;e doctrines have ever been aver&s;e to mirth, and always begin by recommending gravity, when they intended to di&s;&s;eminate impo&s;ture. Fohi, the idol of China, is repre&s;ented as having never laughed; Zoroa&s;ter the leader of the Bramins is &s;aid to have laughed but twice, upon his coming into the world, and upon his leaving it; and Mahomet him&s;elf, though a lover of plea&s;ure, was a profe&s;&s;ed oppo&s;er of gaiety. Upon a certain occa&s;ion telling his fol|lowers, that they would all appear naked at the re&s;urrection, his favourite wife repre&s;ented &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly as immode&s;t and unbecoming. Fool|i&s;h woman, cried the grave prophet, though the whole a&s;&s;embly be naked, on that day they &s;hall have forgotten to laugh. Men like him oppo&s;ed ridicule, becau&s;e they knew it to be a mo&s;t for|midable
<PB N="185" REF="193">
antagoni&s;t, and preached up gravity, to conceal their own want of importance.</P>
<P>Ridicule has ever been the mo&s;t powerful ene|my of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and properly the only anta|goni&s;t that can be oppo&s;ed to it with &s;ucce&s;s. Per|&s;ecution only &s;erves to propagate new religions; they acquire fre&s;h vigour beneath the executioner and the ax, and like &s;ome vivacious in&s;ects, multiply by di&s;&s;ection. It is al&s;o impo&s;&s;ible to combat en|thu&s;ia&s;m with rea&s;on, for though it makes a &s;hew of re&s;i&s;tance, it &s;oon eludes the pre&s;&s;ure, refers you to di&s;tinctions not to be under&s;tood, and feel|ings which it cannot explain. A man who would endeavour to fix an enthu&s;ia&s;t by argument, might as well attempt to &s;pread quick&s;ilver with his fingers. The only way to conquer a vi&s;ionary is to de&s;pi&s;e him; the &s;take, the faggot, and the di&s;puting Doctor, in &s;ome mea&s;ure ennoble the opinions they are brought to oppo&s;e; they are harmle&s;s again&s;t innovating pride; contempt alone is truly dreadful. Hunters generally know the mo&s;t vulnerable part of the bea&s;ts they pur&s;ue, by the care which every animal takes to defend the &s;ide which is weake&s;t; on what &s;ide the en|thu&s;ia&s;t is mo&s;t vulnerable, may be known by the care which he takes in the beginning to work his di&s;ciples into gravity, and guard them again&s;t the power of ridicule.</P>
<P>When Philip the &s;econd was King of Spain, there was a conte&s;t in Salamanca between two or|ders of friars for &s;uperiority. The legend of one &s;ide contained more extraordinary miracles, but the legend of the other was reckoned mo&s;t au|thentic. They reviled each other, as is u&s;ual in
<PB N="186" REF="194">
di&s;putes of divinity, the people were divided into factions, and a civil war appeared unavoidable. In order to prevent &s;uch an imminent calamity, the combatants were prevailed upon to &s;ubmit their legions to the fiery trial, and that which came forth untouched by the fire was to have the victory, and to be honoured with a double &s;hare of reverence. Whenever the people flock to &s;ee a miracle, it is an hundred to one, but that they &s;ee a miracle; incredible therefore were the num|bers that were gathered round upon this occa&s;ion; the friars on each &s;ide approached, and confidently threw their re&s;pective legends into the flames, when lo, to the utter di&s;appointment of all the a&s;&s;embly, in&s;tead of a miracle, both legends were con&s;umed. Nothing but thus turning both parties into con|tempt, could have prevented the effu&s;ion of blood. The people now laughed at their former folly, and wondered why they fell out. Adieu.</P>

<P>THE Engli&s;h are at pre&s;ent employed in cele|brating a fea&s;t which becomes general every &s;eventh year; the Parliament of the nation being then di&s;&s;olved and another appointed to be cho&s;en. This &s;olemnity falls infinitely &s;hort of our fea&s;t of the lanthorns in magnificence and &s;plendour; it is al&s;o &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by others of the Ea&s;t in unanimity and pure devotion, but no fe&s;tival in the world can compare with it for eating. Their eating indeed amazes me: Had I five hundred heads, and were each head furni&s;hed with brains, yet would they
<PB N="187" REF="195">
all be in&s;ufficient to compute the number of cows, pigs, gee&s;e and turkies, which upon this occa&s;ion die for the good of their country!</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth, eating &s;eems to make a grand ingredient in all Engli&s;h parties of zeal, bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ement. When a Church is to be built, or an Ho&s;pital endowed, the Directors a&s;&s;emble, and in&s;tead of con&s;ulting upon it, they eat upon it, by which means the bu&s;ine&s;s goes forward with &s;ucce&s;s. When the Poor are to be relieved, the officers appointed to dole out public charity, a&s;|&s;emble and eat upon it: Nor has it ever been known, that they filled the bellies of the poor till they had previou&s;ly &s;atisfied their own. But in the election of Magi&s;trates the people &s;eem to ex|ceed all bounds; the merits of a candidate are often mea&s;ured by the number of his treats; his con&s;tituents a&s;&s;emble, eat upon him, and lend their applau&s;e, not to his integrity or &s;en&s;e, but the quantities of his beef and brandy.</P>
<P>And yet I could forgive this people their plenti|ful meals on this occa&s;ion, as it is extremely na|tural for every man to eat a great deal when he gets it for nothing; but what amazes me is, that all this good living no way contributes to improve their good humour. On the contrary, they &s;eem to lo&s;e their temper as they lo&s;e their appetites; every mor&s;el they &s;wallow, and every gla&s;s they pour down &s;erves to encrea&s;e their animo&s;ity. Many an hone&s;t man, before as harmle&s;s as a tame rabbit, when loaded with a &s;ingle election dinner, has become more dangerous than a charged cul|verin. Upon one of the&s;e occa&s;ions, I have ac|tually &s;een a bloody minded Man Milliner &s;ally
<PB N="188" REF="196">
forth at the head of a mob, determined to face a de&s;perate Pa&s;try Cook, who was General of the oppo&s;ite party.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e they are without a pretext for thus beating each other. On the con|trary, no man here is &s;o uncivilized as to beat his neighbour without producing very &s;ufficient rea|&s;ons. One candidate, for in&s;tance, treats with gin, a &s;pirit of their own manufacture; another, al|ways drinks brandy imported from abroad. Bran|dy is a whole&s;ome liquor; gin a liquor whol|ly their own. This then furni&s;hes an obvious cau&s;e of quarrel, Whether it be mo&s;t rea&s;onable to get drunk with gin, or get drunk with brandy? The mob meet upon the debate; fight them&s;elves &s;ober; and then draw off to get drunk again, and charge for another encounter. So that the Engli&s;h may now properly be &s;aid to be engaged in war; &s;ince while they are &s;ubduing their enemies abroad, they are breaking each other's heads at home.</P>
<P>I lately made an excur&s;ion to a neighbouring village, in order to be a &s;pectator of the cere|monies practi&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion. I left town in company with three fidlers, nine dozen of hams, and a corporation poet, which were de&s;igned as reinforcements to the gin drinking party. We entered the town with a very good face; the fid|lers, no way intimidated by the enemy, kept hand|ling their arms up the principal &s;treet. By this prudent manoeuvre they took peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their head-quarters, amid&s;t the &s;houts of multi|tudes, who &s;eemed perfectly rejoiced at hearing their mu&s;ic, but above all at &s;eeing their bacon.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="197">I mu&s;t own I could not avoid being plea&s;ed to &s;ee all ranks of people on this occa&s;ion, levelled into an equality, and the poor, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, en|joying the primitive privileges of nature. If there was any di&s;tinction &s;hewn, the lowe&s;t of the peo|ple &s;eemed to receive it from the rich. I could perceive a cobler with a levee at his door, and an haberda&s;her giving audience from behind his coun|ter. But my reflections were &s;oon interrupted by a mob, who demanded whether I was for the Di&s;tillery, or the Brewery? as the&s;e were terms with which I was totally unacquainted, I cho&s;e at fir&s;t to be &s;ilent; however, I know not what might have been the con&s;equence of my re&s;erve, had not the attention of the mob been called off to a &s;kirmi&s;h between a brandy-drinker's cow, and a gin-drinker's ma&s;tiff, which turned out, greatly to the &s;atisfaction of the mob, in favour of the ma&s;tiff.</P>
<P>This &s;pectacle, which afforded high entertain|ment, was at la&s;t ended by the appearance of one of the candidates; who came to harangue the mob; he made a very pathetic &s;peech upon the late ex|ce&s;&s;ive importation of foreign drams; and the downfall of the di&s;tillery: I could &s;ee &s;ome of the audience &s;hed tears. He was accompanied in his proce&s;&s;ion by Mrs. Deputy and Mrs. Mayore&s;s. Mrs. Deputy was not in the lea&s;t in liquor; and for Mrs. Mayore&s;s, one of the &s;pectators a&s;&s;ured me in my ear that, &mdash; She was a very fine woman be|fore &s;he had the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>Mixing with the croud, I was now conducted to the hall where the magi&s;trates are cho&s;en; but what tongue can de&s;cribe this &s;cene of confu&s;ion; the whole crowd &s;eemed equally in&s;pired with an|ger,
<PB N="190" REF="198">
jealou&s;y, politics, patrioti&s;m and punch: I remarked one figure that was carried up by two men upon this occa&s;ion. I at fir&s;t began to pity his infirmities as natural, but &s;oon found the fel|low &s;o drunk that he could not &s;tand; another made his appearance to give his vote, but though he could &s;tand, he actually lo&s;t the u&s;e of his tongue, and remained &s;ilent; a third, who though exce&s;&s;ively drunk could both &s;tand and &s;peak, be|ing a&s;ked the Candidate's name for whom he voted, could be prevailed upon to make no other an&s;wer, but Tobacco and Brandy. In &s;hort, an election-hall &s;eems to be a theatre where every pa&s;&s;ion is &s;een without di&s;gui&s;e; a &s;chool where fools may readily become wor&s;e, and where philo&s;o|phers may gather wi&s;dom.

<P>THE di&s;putes among the learned here are now carried on in a much more compendious man|ner than formerly. There was a time when fo|lio was brought to oppo&s;e folio, and a champion was often li&s;ted for life under the banners of a &s;ingle &s;orites. At pre&s;ent, the controver&s;y is de|cided in a &s;ummary way; an epigram or an acro&s;|tic fini&s;hes the debate, and the combatant, like the incur&s;ive Tartar, advances, and retires with a &s;ingle blow.</P>
<P>An important literary debate at pre&s;ent engro&s;&s;es the attention of the town. It is carried on with
<PB N="191" REF="199">
&s;harpne&s;s, and a proper &s;hare of this epigram|matical fury. An author, it &s;eems has taken an aver&s;ion to the faces of &s;everal players, and has written ver&s;es to prove his di&s;like; the players fall upon the author, and a&s;&s;ure the town he mu&s;t be dull, and their faces mu&s;t be good, becau&s;e he wants a dinner; a critic comes to the poet's a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, a&s;&s;erting, that the ver&s;es were perfectly original, and &s;o &s;mart that he could never have written them without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of friends; the friends upon this arraign the critic, and plainly prove the ver&s;es to be all the author's own. So at it they are all four together by the ears, the friends at the critic, the critic at the players, the players at the author, and the author at the players again. It is impo&s;&s;ible to determine how this many-&s;ided conte&s;t will end, or which party to adhere to. The town, without &s;iding with any, views the com|bat in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, like the fabled hero of antiquity, who beheld the earth-born brothers give and re|ceive mutual wounds, and fall by indi&s;criminate de&s;truction.</P>
<P>This is in &s;ome mea&s;ure a &s;tate of the pre&s;ent di&s;pute; but the combatants here differ in one re&s;pect from the champions of the fable. Every new wound only gives vigour for another blow; though they appear to &s;trike, they are in fact mu|tually &s;welling them&s;elves into con&s;ideration, and thus adverti&s;ing each other away into fame. To|day &s;ays one, my name &s;hall be in the Gazette, the next day my rival's; people will naturally enquire about us; thus we &s;hall at lea&s;t make a noi&s;e in the &s;treets, though we have got nothing to &s;ell. I have read of a di&s;pute of a &s;imilar nature, which was managed here about twenty years ago. Hilde|brand
<PB N="192" REF="200">
Jacob, as I think he was called, and Charles John&s;on were poets, both at that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great reputation, for John&s;on had written eleven plays acted with great &s;ucce&s;s, and Jacob, though he had written but five, had five times thanked the town for their unmerited applau&s;e. They &s;oon be|came mutually enamoured of each other's talents; they wrote, they felt, they challenged the town for each other. John&s;on a&s;&s;ured the public that no poet alive had the ea&s;y &s;implicity of Jacob, and Jacob exhibited John&s;on as a ma&s;ter-piece in the pathetic. Their mutual prai&s;e was not without effect, the town &s;aw their plays, were in raptures, read, and without cen&s;uring them, forgot them. So formidable an union, however, was &s;oon op|po&s;ed by Tibbald. Tibbald a&s;&s;erted that the tra|gedies of one had faults, and the comedies of the other &s;ub&s;tituted wit for vivacity; the combined champions flew at him like tygers, arraigned the cen&s;urer's judgment, and impeached his &s;incerity. It was a long time a di&s;pute among the learned, which was in fact the greate&s;t man, Jacob, John|&s;on or Tibbald; they had all written for the &s;tage with great &s;ucce&s;s, their names were &s;een in almo&s;t every paper, and their works in every cof|fee-hou&s;e. However, in the hotte&s;t of the di&s;pute, a fourth combatant made his appearance, and &s;wept away the three combatants, tragedy, comedy and all into undi&s;tingui&s;hed ruin.</P>
<P>From this time they &s;eemed con&s;igned into the hands of critici&s;m, &s;carce a day pa&s;&s;ed in which they were not arraigned as dete&s;ted writers. The critics, the&s;e enemies of Dryden and Pope, were their enemies. So Jacob and John&s;on, in&s;tead of mending by critici&s;m, called it envy, and becau&s;e Dryden and Pope were cen&s;ured, they compared them&s;elves to Dryden and Pope.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="201">But to return; the weapon chiefly u&s;ed in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y is Epigram, and certainly never was a keener made u&s;e of. They have di&s;covered &s;urpri&s;ing &s;harpne&s;s on both &s;ides. The fir&s;t that came out upon this occa&s;ion was a kind of new compo&s;ition in this way, and might more properly be called an epigrammatic the&s;is, than an Epigram. It con&s;i&s;ts, fir&s;t, of an argument in pro&s;e; next follows a motto from Ro&s;common; then comes the the epigram; and la&s;tly, notes &s;erving to explain the Epigram.

<P>There, there's a perplex! I could have wi&s;hed, to make it quite perfect, the author, as in the ca&s;e before, had added notes. Almo&s;t every word admits a &s;cholium, and a long one too. I, YOU, HE! Suppo&s;e a &s;tranger &s;hould a&s;k, and who are you? Here are three ob&s;cure per&s;ons &s;poken of, that may in a &s;hort time be utterly forgotten.

<P>Yet by being thus a &s;pectator of others dangers, I mu&s;t own I begin to tremble in this literary conte&s;t for my own.

<P>THE Formalities, delays and di&s;appointments, that precede a treaty of marriage here, are u&s;ually as numerous as tho&s;e previous to a treaty of peace. The laws of this country are finely cal|culated
<PB N="196" REF="204">
to promote all commerce, but the com|merce between the &s;exes. Their encouragements for propagating hemp, madder and tobacco, are indeed admirable! Marriages are the only com|modity that meet with none.</P>
<P>Yet from the vernal &s;oftne&s;s of the air, the ver|dure of the fields, the tran&s;parency of the &s;treams, and the beauty of the women, I know few coun|tries more proper to invite to court&s;hip. Here love might &s;port among painted lawns and warbling groves, and revel upon gales, wafting at once both fragrance and harmony. Yet it &s;eems he has for&s;aken the i&s;land; and when a couple are now to be married, mutual love or an union of minds is the la&s;t and mo&s;t trifling con&s;ideration. If their goods and chattles can be brought to unite, their &s;ympathetic &s;ouls are ever ready to guarantee the treaty. The gentleman's mortgaged lawn becomes enamoured of the ladies marriagable grove; the match is &s;truck up, and both parties are piou&s;ly in love&mdash;according to act of Parliament.</P>
<P>Thus they, who have fortune, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at lea&s;t of &s;omething that is lovely; but I actually pity tho&s;e that have none. I am told there was a time, when Ladies with no other merit but youth, virtue and beauty, had a chance for hu&s;bands, at lea&s;t, among the mini&s;ters of the church, or the officers of the army. The blu&s;h and innocence of &s;ixteen was &s;aid to have a powerful influence over the&s;e two profe&s;&s;ions. But of late, all the little traffic of blu&s;hing, ogling, dimpling, and &s;miling, has been forbidden by an act in that ca&s;e wi&s;ely made and provided. A Lady's whole cargo of &s;miles, &s;ighs and whi&s;pers, is declared utterly
<PB N="197" REF="205">
contraband, till &s;he arrives in the warm latitudes of twenty-two, where commodities of this nature are too often found to decay. She is then per|mitted to dimple and &s;mile, when the dimples and &s;miles begin to for&s;ake her; and when per|haps grown ugly, is charitably entru&s;ted with an unlimited u&s;e of her charms. Her lovers, how|ever, by this time have for&s;aken her; the captain has changed for another mi&s;tre&s;s; the prie&s;t him|&s;elf leaves her in &s;olitude, to bewail her virginity, and &s;he dies even without benefit of clergy.</P>
<P>Thus you find the Europeans di&s;couraging love with as much earne&s;tne&s;s as the rude&s;t &s;avage of Sofala. The Genius is &s;urely now no more. In every region I find enemies in arms to oppre&s;s him. Avarice in Europe, jealou&s;y in Per&s;ia, ceremony in China, poverty among the Tartars, and lu&s;t in Circa&s;&s;ia, are all prepared to oppo&s;e his power. The Genius is certainly bani&s;hed from earth, though once adored under &s;uch a variety of forms. He is no where to be found; and all that the Ladies of each country can produce, are but a few trifling reliques as in&s;tances of his former re&s;idence and favour.</P>
<P>The genius of Love, &s;ays the ea&s;tern Apologue, had long re&s;ided in the happy plains of Abra, where every breeze was health, and every &s;ound produced tranquility. His temple at fir&s;t was crowded, but every age le&s;&s;ened the number of his votaries, or cooled their devotion. Perceiv|ing, therefore, his altars at length quite de&s;erted, he was re&s;olved to remove to &s;ome more propitious region, and he apprized the fair &s;ex of every coun|try, where he could hope for a proper reception,
<PB N="198" REF="206">
to a&s;&s;ert their right to his pre&s;ence among them. In return to this proclamation, emba&s;&s;ies were &s;ent from the Ladies of every part of the world to invite him, and to di&s;play the &s;uperiority of their claims.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t the beauties of China appeared. No country could compare with them for mode&s;ty, either of look, dre&s;s, or behaviour; their eyes were never lifted from the ground; their robes of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;ilk hid their hands, bo&s;om and neck, while their faces only were left un|covered. They indulged no airs that might ex|pre&s;s loo&s;e de&s;ire, and they &s;eemed to &s;tudy only the graces of inanimate beauty. Their black teeth and plucked eyebrows were, however, alledged by the Genius again&s;t them, but he &s;et them entirely a&s;ide when he came to examine their little feet.</P>
<P>The beauties of Circa&s;&s;ia next made their ap|pearance. They advanced hand in hand, &s;inging the mo&s;t immode&s;t airs, and leading up a dance in the mo&s;t luxurious attitudes. Their dre&s;s was but half a covering; the neck, the left brea&s;t, and all the limbs, were expo&s;ed to view, which after &s;ome time &s;eemed rather to &s;atiate than inflame de&s;ire. The lily and the ro&s;e contended in forming their complexions; and a &s;oft &s;leepine&s;s of eye added irre&s;i&s;tible poignance to their charms: but their beauties were obtruded, not offered to their ad|mirers; they &s;eemed to give rather than receive court&s;hip; and the genius of Love di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them as unworthy his regard, &s;ince they exchanged the duties of love, and made them&s;elves not the pur&s;ued, but the pur&s;uing &s;ex.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="207">The kingdom of Ka&s;hmire next produced its charming deputies. This happy region &s;eemed peculiarly &s;eque&s;tered by nature for his abode. Shady mountains fenced it on one &s;ide from the &s;corching &s;un; and &s;eaborn breezes, on the other, gave peculiar luxuriance to the air. Their com|plexions were of a bright yellow, that appeared almo&s;t tran&s;parent, while the crim&s;on tulip &s;eem|ed to blo&s;&s;om on their cheeks. Their features and limbs were delicate beyond the &s;tatuary's power to expre&s;s; and their teeth whiter than their own ivory. He was almo&s;t per&s;uaded to re&s;ide among them, when unfortunately one of the ladies talked of appointing his &s;eraglio.</P>
<P>In this proce&s;&s;ion the naked inhabitants of Southern America would not be left behind: their charms were found to &s;urpa&s;s whatever the warm|e&s;t imagination could conceive; and &s;erved to &s;hew, that beauty could be perfect, even with the &s;eem|ing di&s;advantage of a brown complexion But their &s;avage education rendered them utterly un|qualified to make the proper u&s;e of their power, and they were rejected as being incapable of uniting mental with &s;en&s;ual &s;atisfaction. In this manner the deputies of other kingdoms had their &s;uits rejec|ted: the black beauties of Benin, and the tawny daughters of Borneo, the women of Wida with well &s;carred faces, and the hideous virgins of Cafraria; the &s;quab ladies of Lapland, three feet high, and the giant fair ones of Patagonia.</P>
<P>The beauties of Europe at la&s;t appeared: grace was in their &s;teps, and &s;en&s;ibility &s;ate &s;miling in every eye. It was the univer&s;al opinion, while they were approaching, that they would prevail;
<PB N="200" REF="208">
and the Genius &s;eemed to lend them his mo&s;t favourable attention. They opened their preten|&s;ions with the utmo&s;t mode&s;ty; but unfortunately as their orator proceeded &s;he happened to let fall the words <HI>hou&s;e in town, &s;ettlement and pin-money.</HI> The&s;e &s;eemingly harmle&s;s terms had in&s;tantly a &s;urpri&s;ing effect: the Genius with ungovernable rage bur&s;t from amid&s;t the circle; and waving his youthful pinions, left this earth, and flew back to tho&s;e etherial man&s;ions from whence he de&s;cended.</P>
<P>The whole a&s;&s;embly was &s;truck with amaze|ment: they now ju&s;tly apprehended, that female power would be no more, &s;ince love had for&s;aken them. They continued &s;ome time thus in a &s;tate of torpid de&s;pair, when it was propo&s;ed by one of the number&punc; that, &s;ince the real Genius had left them, in order to continue their power, they &s;hould &s;et up an idol in his &s;tead; and that the ladies of every country &s;hould furni&s;h him with what each liked be&s;t. This propo&s;al was in&s;tantly reli&s;hed and agreed to. An idol was formed by uniting the capricious gifts of all the a&s;&s;embly, tho' no way re&s;embling the departed Genius. The ladies of China furni&s;hed the mon&s;ter with wings; tho&s;e of Ka&s;hmire &s;upplied him with horns; the dames of Europe clapped a pur&s;e in his hand; and the virgins of Congo furni&s;hed him with a tail Since that time, all the vows addre&s;&s;ed to love are in reality paid to the idol; but, as in other fal&s;e religions, the adoration &s;eems mo&s;t fervent, where the heart is lea&s;t &s;incere.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXII.</HI> To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND have ever been prone to expati|ate in the prai&s;e of human nature. The dignity of man is a &s;ubject that has always been the favourite theme of humanity; they have de|claimed with that o&s;tentation, which u&s;ually ac|companies &s;uch as are &s;ure of having a partial audience; they have obtained victories, becau&s;e there were none to oppo&s;e. Yet from all I have ever read or &s;een, men appear more apt to err by having too high, than by having too de&s;|picable an opinion of their nature; and by attempt|ing to exalt their original place in the creation, depre&s;s their real value in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t ignorant nations have always been found to think mo&s;t highly of them&s;elves. The Deity has ever been thought peculiarly concerned in their glory and pre&s;ervation; to have fought their battles, and in&s;pired their teachers: their wizzards are &s;aid to be familiar with heaven; and every hero has a guard of angels, as well as men to attend him. When the Portugue&s;e fir&s;t came among the wretched inhabitants of the coa&s;t of Africa, the&s;e &s;avage nations readily allowed the &s;trangers more &s;kill in navigation and war; yet &s;till con&s;idered them, at be&s;t, but as u&s;eful &s;ervants brought to their coa&s;ts, by their guardian &s;erpent, to &s;upply them with luxuries they could have lived without. Though they could grant the Portugue&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="210">
more riches; they could never allow them to have &s;uch a king as their Tottimondelem, who wore a bracelet of &s;hells round his neck, and who&s;e legs were covered with ivory.</P>
<P>In this manner, examine a &s;avage in the hi&s;tory of his country and predece&s;&s;ors; you ever find his warriors able to conquer armies, and his &s;ages ac|quainted with more than po&s;&s;ible knowledge: hu|man nature is to him an unknown country; he thinks it capable of great things, becau&s;e he is igno|rant of its boundaries; whatever can be conceived to be done he allows to be po&s;&s;ible, and whatever is po&s;&s;ible he conjectures mu&s;t have been done. He never mea&s;ures the actions and powers of others by what him&s;elf is able to perform, nor makes a proper e&s;timate of the greatne&s;s of his fellows by bringing it to the &s;tandard of his own incapacity. He is &s;atisfied to be one of a country where mighty things have been; and imagines the fancied power of others reflects a lu&s;tre on him&s;elf. Thus, by de|grees, he lo&s;es the idea of his own in&s;ignificance in a confu&s;ed notion of the extraordinary powers of humanity, and is willing to grant extraordinary gifts to every pretender, becau&s;e unacquainted with their claims.</P>
<P>This is the rea&s;on, why Demi-gods and Heroes have ever been erected in times or countries of ignorance and barbarity; they addre&s;&s;ed a people who had high opinions of human nature, becau&s;e they were ignorant how far it could extend; they addre&s;&s;ed a people who were willing to allow that men &s;hould be gods, becau&s;e they were yet im|perfectly acquainted with God, and with man. The&s;e impo&s;tors knew, that all men are naturally
<PB N="203" REF="211">
fond of &s;eeing &s;omething very great made from the little materials of humanity; that ignorant nations are not more proud of building a tower to reach heaven, or a pyramid to la&s;t for ages, than of rai&s;ing up a Demi-god of their own country and creation. The &s;ame pride, that erects a colo&s;|&s;us or a pyramid, in&s;talls a God or an Hero: but though the adoring &s;avage can rai&s;e his colo&s;&s;us to the clouds, he can exalt the Hero not one inch above the &s;tandard of humanity; incapable there|fore of exalting the idol, he deba&s;es him&s;elf and falls pro&s;trate before him.</P>
<P>When man has thus acquired an erroneous idea of the dignity of his &s;pecies, he and the Gods become perfectly intimate; men are but angels, angels are but men, nay but &s;ervants that &s;tand in waiting to execute human commands. The Per|&s;ians, for in&s;tance, thus addre&s;s their prophet Haly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chardins' Travels, p. 401.</NOTE>.

friend, men think proper to treat angels; but if indeed there be &s;uch an order of beings, with what a degree of &s;atirical contempt mu&s;t they li&s;ten to the &s;ongs of little mortals thus flattering each other. Thus to &s;ee creatures, wi&s;er indeed than the monkey, and more active than the oy&s;ter, claiming to them&s;elves the ma&s;tery of heaven; minims, the tenants of an atom, thus arrogating a a partner&s;hip in the creation of univer&s;al nature! Sure heaven is kind that launches no thunder at tho&s;e guilty heads; but it is kind, and regards their follies with pity, nor will de&s;troy creatures that it loved into being.</P>
<P>But whatever &s;ucce&s;s this practice of making Demi-gods might have been attended with in barbarous nations, I don't know that any man became a God in a country, where the inhabitants were refined. Such countries generally have too clo&s;e an in&s;pection into human weakne&s;s, to think it inve&s;ted with cele&s;tial power.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXIII.</HI> To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is &s;omething irre&s;i&s;tibly plea&s;ing in the conver&s;ation of a fine woman; even though her tongue be &s;ilent, the eloquence of her eyes teaches wi&s;dom. The mind &s;ympathizes with the regularity of the object in view, and &s;truck with external grace, vibrates into re&s;pondent harmony. In this agreeable di&s;po&s;ition, I lately found my&s;elf in company with my friend and his niece. Our conver&s;ation turned upon love, which &s;he &s;eemed equally capable of defending and in&s;piring. We were each of different opinions upon this &s;ubject; the lady in&s;i&s;ted that it was a natural and uni|ver&s;al pa&s;&s;ion, and produced the happine&s;s of tho&s;e who cultivated it with proper precaution. My friend denied it to be the work of nature, but allowed it to have a real exi&s;tence, and affirmed that it was of infinite &s;ervice in refining &s;ociety; while I, to keep up the di&s;pute, affirmed it to be merely a name, fir&s;t u&s;ed by the cunning part of the fair &s;ex, and admitted by the &s;illy part of ours, there|fore no way more natural than taking &s;nuff or chewing opium.</P>
<P>"How is it po&s;&s;ible, cried I, that &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion can be natural, when our opinions even of beauty, which in&s;pires it, are entirely the re&s;ult of fa&s;hion and caprice? The ancients, who pretended to be connoi&s;&s;eurs in the art, have prai&s;ed narrow fore|heads, red hair, and eyebrows that joined each other over the no&s;e. Such were the charms that
<PB N="206" REF="214">
once captivated Catullus, Ovid, and Anacreon. Ladies would at pre&s;ent be out of humour, if their lovers prai&s;ed them for &s;uch graces; and &s;hould an antique beauty now revive, her face would certainly be put under the di&s;cipline of the twee|zer, forehead-cloth and lead comb, before it could be &s;een in public company."</P>
<P>"But the difference between the antients and moderns is not &s;o great, as between the different countries of the pre&s;ent world. A lover of Gon|gora, for in&s;tance, &s;ighs for thick lips; a Chine&s;e lover is poetical in prai&s;e of thin. In Circa&s;&s;ia a &s;treight no&s;e is thought mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with beau|ty; cro&s;s but a mountain which &s;eparates it from the Tartars, and there flat no&s;es, tawny &s;kins, and eyes three inches a&s;under, are all the fa&s;hion. In Per&s;ia and &s;ome other countries, a man when he marries, chu&s;es to have his bride a maid; in the Phillipine I&s;lands, if a bridegroom happens to per|ceive on the fir&s;t night that he is put off with a virgin, the marriage is declared void to all in|tents and purpo&s;es, and the bride &s;ent back with di&s;grace. In &s;ome parts of the Ea&s;t, a woman of beauty, properly fed up for &s;ale, often amounts to one hundred crowns; in the kingdom of Loango, Ladies of the very be&s;t fa&s;hion are &s;old for a pig, Queens however &s;ell better, and &s;ometimes amount to a cow. In &s;hort, turn even to England, don't I there &s;ee the beautiful part of the &s;ex neglected; and none now marrying or making love but old men and old women that have &s;aved money? Don't I &s;ee beauty from fifteen to twenty one rendered null and void to all intents and purpo&s;es, and tho&s;e &s;ix precious years of womanhood put under a
<PB N="207" REF="215" MS="y">
&s;tatute of virginity? What! &s;hall I call that rancid pa&s;&s;ion love, which pa&s;&s;es between an old batchelor of fifty-&s;ix and a widow lady of forty-nine? Never! never! What advantage is &s;ociety to reap from an intercour&s;e, where the big belly is oftne&s;t on the man's &s;ide? Would any per&s;uade me that &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion was natural, unle&s;s the human race were more fit for love as they approach'd the decline, and, like &s;ilk-worms, became breeders, ju&s;t before they expired?"</P>
<P>Whether love be natural or no, replied my friend, gravely, it contributes to the happine&s;s of every &s;ociety into which it is introduced. All our plea|&s;ures are &s;hort, and can only charm at intervals: love is a method of protracting our greate&s;t plea|&s;ure; and &s;urely that game&s;ter, who plays the great|e&s;t &s;take to the be&s;t advantage, will at the end of life, ri&s;e victorious. This was the opinion of Va|nini, who affirmed that <HI>every hour was lo&s;t which was not &s;pent in love.</HI> His accu&s;ers were unable to comprehend his meaning, and the poor advocate for love was burned in flames, alas, no way meta|phorical. But whatever advantages the individual may reap from this pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ociety will certainly be refined and improved by its introduction: All laws, calculated to di&s;courage it, tend to embrute the &s;pecies, and weaken the &s;tate. Though it can|not plant morals in the human brea&s;t, it cultivates them when there: pity, genero&s;ity, and honour, receive a brighter poli&s;h from its a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and a &s;ingle amour is &s;ufficient entirely to bru&s;h off the clown.</P>
<P>But it is an exotic of the mo&s;t delicate con&s;ti|tution; it requires the greate&s;t art to introduce it
<PB N="208" REF="216">
into a &s;tate, and the &s;malle&s;t di&s;couragement is &s;ufficient to repre&s;s it again. Let us only con&s;ider with what ea&s;e it was formerly extingui&s;hed in Rome, and with what difficulty it was lately re|vived in Europe: it &s;eemed to &s;leep for ages, and at la&s;t fought its way among us through tilts, tour|naments, dragons, and all the dreams of chivalry. The re&s;t of the world, China only excepted, are and have ever been utter &s;trangers to its delights and advantages. In other countries, as men find them&s;elves &s;tronger than women, they lay a claim to a rigorous &s;uperiority; this is natural, and love which gives up this natural advantage mu&s;t cer|tainly be the effect of art. An art calculated to lengthen out our happier moments, and add new graces to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I entirely acquie&s;ce in your &s;entiments, &s;ays the lady, with regard to the advantages of this pa&s;|&s;ion, but cannot avoid giving it a nobler origin than you have been plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign. I mu&s;t think, that tho&s;e countries, where it is rejected, are obliged to have recour&s;e to art to &s;tifle &s;o natural a production, and tho&s;e nations, where it is cul|tivated, only make nearer advances to nature. The &s;ame efforts, that are u&s;ed in &s;ome places to &s;uppre&s;s pity and other natural pa&s;&s;ions, may have been employed to extingui&s;h love. No nation, however unpoli&s;hed, is remarkable for innocence, that is not famous for pa&s;&s;ion; it has flouri&s;hed in the colde&s;t, as well as the warme&s;t regions. Even in the &s;ultry wilds of &s;outhern America, the lover is not &s;atisfied with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his mi&s;tre&s;s's per&s;on without having her mind.

But the effects of love are too violent to be the re|&s;ult of an artificial pa&s;&s;ion. Nor is it in the power of fa&s;hion to force the con&s;titution into tho&s;e chan|ges which we every day ob&s;erve. Several have died of it. Few lovers are unacquainted with the fate of the two Italian lovers, Da Cor&s;in and Julia Bella|mano, who after a long &s;eparation expired with plea&s;ure in each others arms. Such in&s;tances are too &s;trong confirmations of the reality of the pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;erve to &s;hew that &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it, is but oppo&s;ing the natural dictates of the heart.</P>

<P>THE clock ju&s;t &s;truck two, the expiring taper ri&s;es and &s;inks in the &s;ocket, the watchman forgets the hour in &s;lumber, the laborious and the happy are at re&s;t, and nothing wakes but medita|tion, guilt, revelry and de&s;pair. The drunkard once more fills the de&s;troying bowl, the robber walks his
<PB N="210" REF="218">
midnight round, and the &s;uicide lifts his guilty arm again&s;t his own &s;acred per&s;on.</P>
<P>Let me no longer wa&s;te the night over the page of antiquity, or the &s;allies of cotemporary genius, but pur&s;ue the &s;olitary walk, where vanity, ever changing, but a few hours pa&s;t, walked before me, where &s;he kept up the pageant, and now, like a froward child, &s;eems hu&s;hed with her own importunities.</P>
<P>What a gloom hangs all around! the dying lamp feebly emits a yellow gleam, no &s;ound is heard but of the chiming clock, or the di&s;tant watch-dog. All the bu&s;tle of human pride is forgotten, an hour like this may well di&s;play the emptine&s;s of human vanity.</P>
<P>There will come a time when this temporary &s;olitude may be made continual, and the city it|&s;elf, like its inhabitants, fade away, and leave a de&s;art in its room.</P>
<P>What cities, as great as this, have once tri|umphed in exi&s;tence, had their victories as great, joy as ju&s;t, and as unbounded, and with &s;hort-&s;ighted pre&s;umption, promi&s;ed them&s;elves immor|tality. Po&s;terity can hardly trace the &s;ituation of &s;ome. The &s;orrowful traveller wanders over the awful ruins of others; and as he beholds, he learns wi&s;dom, and feels the tran&s;ience of every &s;ublunary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Here, he cries, &s;tood their citadel, now grown over with weeds; there their &s;enate-hou&s;e, but now the haunt of every noxious reptile; temples
<PB N="211" REF="219">
and theatres &s;tood here, now only an undi&s;tingui&s;h|ed heap of ruin. They are fallen, for luxury and avarice fir&s;t made them feeble. The rewards of &s;tate were conferred on amu&s;ing, and not on u&s;eful, members of &s;ociety. Their riches and opulence invited the invaders, who, though at fir&s;t repul&s;ed, returned again, conquered by per&s;everance, and at la&s;t &s;wept the defendants into undi&s;tingui&s;hed de&s;truction.</P>
<P>How few appear in tho&s;e &s;treets, which but &s;ome few hours ago were crowded; and tho&s;e who appear, now no longer wear their daily ma&s;k, nor attempt to hide their lewdne&s;s or their mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But who are tho&s;e who make the &s;treets their couch, and find a &s;hort repo&s;e from wretchedne&s;s at the doors of the oppulent? The&s;e are &s;trangers, wanderers, and orphans, who&s;e circum&s;tances are too humble to expect redre&s;s, and who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es are too great even for pity. Their wretchedne&s;s ex|cites rather horror than pity. Some are without the covering even of rags, and others emaciated with di&s;ea&s;e; the world has di&s;claimed them; &s;ociety turns its back upon their di&s;tre&s;s, and has given them up to nakedne&s;s and hunger. The&s;e poor &s;hivering females have once &s;een happier days, and been flattered into beauty. They have been pro&s;tituted to the gay luxurious villain, and are now turned out to meet the &s;everity of winter. Perhaps, now lying at the doors of their betrayers, they &s;ue to wretches who&s;e hearts are in&s;en&s;ible, or debauchees who may cur&s;e, but will not relieve them.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="220">Why, why was I born a man, and yet &s;ee the &s;ufferings of wretches I cannot relieve! Poor hou&s;ele&s;s creatures! the world will give you re|proaches, but will not give you relief. The &s;light|e&s;t misfortunes of the great, the mo&s;t imaginary unea&s;ine&s;&s;es of the rich, are aggravated with all the power of eloquence, and held up to engage our attention and &s;ympathetic &s;orrow. The poor weep unheeded, per&s;ecuted by every &s;ubordinate &s;pecies of tyranny; and every law, which gives others &s;ecurity, becomes an enemy to them.</P>
<P>Why was this heart of mine formed with &s;o much &s;en&s;ibility! or why was not my fortune adapted to its impul&s;e! Tenderne&s;s, without a capacity of relieving, only makes the man who feels it more wretched than the object which &s;ues for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Adieu.</P>

I &s;hall leave with joy this proud, barbarous, inho&s;|pitable region, where every object con&s;pires to dimini&s;h my &s;atisfaction, and encrea&s;e my pa|trioti&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="221">But tho' I find the inhabitants &s;avage, yet the Dutch merchants who are permitted to trade hi|ther, &s;eem &s;till more dete&s;table. They have rai&s;ed my di&s;like to Europe in general; by them I learn how low avarice can degrade human nature; how many indignities an European will &s;uffer for gain.</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ent at an audience given by the Em|peror to the Dutch envoy, who had &s;ent &s;everal pre&s;ents to all the courtiers &s;ome days previous to his admi&s;&s;ion; but he was obliged to attend tho&s;e de&s;igned for the Emperor him&s;elf. From the ac|counts I had heard of this ceremony, my curio&s;ity prompted me to be a &s;pectator of the whole.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t went the pre&s;sents, &s;et out on beautiful en|amelled tables, adorned with flowers, borne on mens &s;houlders, and followed by Japone&s;e mu&s;ic and dancers. From &s;o great re&s;pect paid to the gifts them&s;elves, I had fancied the donors mu&s;t have received almo&s;t divine honours. But about a quar|ter of an hour after the pre&s;ents had been carried in triumph, the envoy and his train were brought forward. They were covered from head to foot with long black vails, which prevented their &s;ee|ing, each led by a conductor, cho&s;en from the meane&s;t of the people. In this di&s;honourable manner having traver&s;ed the city of Jedo, they at length arrived at the palace gate, and after waiting half an hour, were admitted into the guard room. Here their eyes were uncovered, and in about an hour the gentleman u&s;her intro|duced them into the hall of audience. The Em|peror was at length &s;hewn &s;itting in a kind of Al|cove at the upper end of the room, and the Dutch envoy was conducted towards the throne.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="222">As &s;oon as he had approach'd within a certain di&s;tance, the gentleman u&s;her cried out with a loud voice, <HI>Holanda Capitan</HI>; upon the&s;e words the envoy fell flat upon the ground, and crept upon his hands and feet towards the throne. Still ap|proaching, he rear'd him&s;elf upon his knees, and then bowed his forehead to the ground. The&s;e ceremonies being over, he was directed to with|draw, &s;till groveling on his belly, and going back|ward like a lob&s;ter.</P>
<P>Men mu&s;t be exce&s;&s;ively fond of riches, when they are earned with &s;uch circum&s;tances of abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Do the Europeans wor&s;hip Heaven it &s;elf with marks of more profound re&s;pect? Do they confer tho&s;e honours on the Supreme of be|ings, which they pay to a barbarous king, who gives them a permi&s;&s;ion to purcha&s;e trinkets and porcelaine! What a glorious exchange, to forfeit their national honour, and even their title to hu|manity, for a &s;creen or a &s;nuff-box!</P>
<P>If the&s;e ceremonies e&s;&s;ayed in the fir&s;t audience appeared mortifying, tho&s;e which are practi&s;ed in the &s;econd are infinitely more &s;o. In the &s;e|cond audience, the Emperor and the ladies of court were placed behind lattices in &s;uch a man|ner as to &s;ee without being &s;een. Here all the Europeans were directed to pa&s;s in review, and grovel and act the &s;erpent as before: with this &s;pectacle the whole court &s;eemed highly delighted. The &s;trangers were a&s;ked a thou&s;and ridiculous que&s;tions; as their names, and their ages: They were ordered to write, to &s;tand upright, to &s;it, to &s;top, to compliment each other, to be drunk, to &s;peak the Japane&s;e language, to talk

Yet the ceremony did not end here, for every great Lord of the court was to be vi&s;ited in the &s;ame manner; and their ladies, who took the whim from their hu&s;bands, were all equally fond of &s;eeing the &s;trangers per|form, even the children &s;eeming highly diverted with the dancing Dutchmen.</P>
<P>Alas, cried I, to my&s;elf, upon returning from &s;uch a &s;pectacle, is this the nation which a&s;&s;umes &s;uch dignity at the court of Pekin? Is this that people that appear &s;o proud at home, and in every country where they have the lea&s;t authority?

<P>THE misfortunes of the great, my friend, are held up to engage our attention, are enlarged upon in tones of declamation, and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble &s;ufferers; they have at once the comfort of admiration and pity.</P>
<P>Yet where is the magnanimity of bearing mis|fortunes when the whole world is looking on? Men in &s;uch circum&s;tances can act bravely even from motives of vanity. He only who, in the vale of ob&s;curity, can brave adver&s;ity, who with|out friends to encourage, acquaintances to pity, or even without hope to alleviate his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, can behave with tranquility and indifference, is truly great: whether pea&s;ant or courtier, he de&s;erves admiration, and &s;hould be held up for our imita|tion and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The mi&s;eries of the poor are however entirely di&s;regarded; tho' &s;ome undergo more real hard|&s;hips in one day, than the great in their whole lives. It is indeed inconceiveable what difficulties

Their &s;evere&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es are plea&s;ures, compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day &s;u&s;tain, without murmuring. The&s;e may eat, drink, and &s;leep, have &s;laves to attend them, and are &s;ure of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for life, while many of their fellow-creatures are obliged to wander, without a friend to comfort or to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, find enmity in every law, and are too poor to obtain even ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I have been led into the&s;e reflections from ac|cidentally meeting &s;ome days ago a poor fellow begging at one of the outlets of this town, with a wooden leg.

The di&s;abled &s;oldier, for &s;uch he was, with an intrepidity truly Briti&s;h, leaning on his crutch, put him&s;elf into an attitude to comply with my reque&s;t, and gave me his hi&s;tory as follows:</P>

It is true, I was not &s;uffered to &s;tir far from the hou&s;e, for fear I &s;hould run away: but what of that, I had the liberty of the whole hou&s;e, and the yard before the door, and that was enough for me.</P>
<P>I was next bound out to a farmer, where I was up both early and late, but I ate and drank well, and liked my bu&s;ine&s;s well enough, till he died. Being then obliged to provide for my&s;elf, I was re&s;olved to go and &s;eek my fortune. Thus I lived, and went from town to town, working when I could get employment, and &s;tarving when I could get none, and might have lived &s;o &s;till: But happening one day to go through a field belonging to a magi&s;trate, I &s;py'd a hare cro&s;&s;ing
<PB N="219" REF="227">
the path ju&s;t before me. I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my &s;tick at it: well, what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away in triumph, when the ju&s;|tice him&s;elf met me: he called me a villain, and collaring me, de&s;ired I would give an account of my&s;elf. I began immediately to give a full ac|count of all that I knew of my breed, &s;eed, and generation: but though I gave a very long ac|count, the ju&s;tice &s;aid, I could give no account of my&s;elf; &s;o I was indicted, and found guilty of being poor, and &s;ent to Newgate, in order to be tran&s;ported to the plantations.</P><P>People may &s;ay this and that of being in jail; but for my part, I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in, in all my life. I had my belly full to eat and drink, and did no work; but alas, this kind of life was too good to la&s;t for ever! I was taken out of pri&s;on, after five months, put on board of a &s;hip, and &s;ent off with two hundred more. Our pa&s;&s;age was but indif|ferent, for we were all confined in the hold, and died very fa&s;t, for want of &s;weet air and provi|&s;ions; but for my part, I did not want meat, becau&s;e I had a fever all the way: providence was kind, when provi&s;ions grew &s;hort, it took away my de&s;ire of eating. When we came a&s;hore, we were &s;old to the planters. I was bound for &s;even years, and as I was no &s;cholar, for I had forgot my letters, I was obliged to work among the negroes; and &s;erved out my time, as in duty bound to do.</P><P>When my time was expired, I worked my pa&s;|&s;age home, and glad I was to &s;ee Old England
<PB N="220" REF="228">
again, becau&s;e I loved my country. O liberty, liberty, liberty! that is the property of every En|gli&s;hman, and I will die in its defence: I was afraid, however, that I &s;hould be indicted for a vagabond once more, &s;o did not much care to go into the country, but kept about town, and did little jobs when I could get them. I was very happy in this manner for &s;ome time; till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then de&s;ired me to &s;tand &s;till. They belonged to a pre&s;s-gang; I was carried before the ju&s;tice, and as I could give no account of my &s;elf, (that was the thing that al|ways hobbled me,) I had my choice left, whether to go on board a man of war, or li&s;t for a &s;ol|dier. I cho&s;e to be a &s;oldier; and in this po&s;t of a gentleman I &s;erved two campaigns, was at the battles in Flanders, and received but one wound through the brea&s;t, which is trouble&s;ome to this day.</P><P>When the peace came on, I was di&s;charged; and as I could not work, becau&s;e my wound was &s;ometimes painful, I li&s;ted for a landman in the Ea&s;t India company's &s;ervice. I here fought the French in &s;ix pitched battles; and verily be|lieve, that if I could read or write, our captain would have given me promotion, and made me a corporal. But that was not my good fortune, I &s;oon fell &s;ick, and when I became good for nothing, got leave to return home a|gain with forty pounds in my pocket, which I &s;aved in the &s;ervice. This was at the beginning of the pre&s;ent war, &s;o I hoped to be &s;et on &s;hore, and to have the plea&s;ure of &s;pending my money; but the government wanted men, and I was
<PB N="221" REF="229">
pre&s;&s;ed again, before ever I could &s;et foot on &s;hore.</P><P>The boat&s;wain found me, as he &s;aid, an ob|&s;tinate fellow: he &s;wore that I under&s;tood my bu&s;ine&s;s perfectly well, but that I pretended &s;ick|ne&s;s merely to be idle: God knows, I knew nothing of &s;ea-bu&s;ine&s;s: He beat me with|out con&s;idering what he was about. But &s;till my forty pounds, was &s;ome comfort to me un|der every beating; the money was my comfort, and the money I might have had to this day; but that our &s;hip was taken by the French, and &s;o I lo&s;t it all!</P><P>Our crew was carried into a French pri&s;on, and many of them died, becau&s;e they were not u&s;ed to live in a jail; but for my part it was nothing to me, for I was &s;ea&s;oned. One night however, as I was &s;leeping on the bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me, (for I always lov|ed to lie well,) I was awaked by the boat&s;wain, who had a dark lanthorn in his hand. 'Jack, &s;ays he to me, will you knock out the French centry's brains?' 'I don't care, &s;ays I, &s;triving to keep my&s;elf awake, if I lend a hand.' 'Then follow me, &s;ays he, and I hope we &s;hall do bu&s;ine&s;s.' So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the cloaths I had, about my mid|dle, and went with him to fight the Frenchmen: we had no arms; but one Engli&s;hman is able to beat five French at any time; &s;o we went down to the door, where both the centries were po&s;ted, and ru&s;hing upon them, &s;eized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence, nine of us ran together to the
<PB N="222" REF="230">
key, and &s;eizing the fir&s;t boat we met, got out of the harbour, and put to &s;ea: we had not been here three days before we were taken up by an Engli&s;h privateer, who was glad of &s;o many good hands; and we con&s;ented to run our chance. However, we had not &s;o much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with a French man of war, of forty guns, while we bad but twenty three; &s;o to it we went. The fight la&s;ted for three hours, and I verily believe we &s;hould have taken the Frenchman, but un|fortunately, we lo&s;t almo&s;t all our men, ju&s;t as we were going to get the victory. I was once more in the power of the French, and I believe it would have gone hard with me, had I been brought back to my old jail in Bre&s;t: but by good fortune, we were re-taken, and carried to England once more.</P><P>I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you, that in this la&s;t engagement I was wounded in two places; I lo&s;t four fingers of the left hand, and my leg was &s;hot off. Had I the good fortune to have lo&s;t my leg and u&s;e of my hand on board a king's &s;hip, and not a privateer, I &s;hould have been entitled to cloathing and maintenance dur|ing the re&s;t of my life, but that was not my chance; one man is born with a &s;ilver &s;poon in his mouth, and another with a wooden ladle. However, ble&s;&s;ed be God, I enjoy good health, and have no enemy in this world that I know of, but the French, and the Ju&s;tice of Peace.</P></Q>
<P>Thus &s;aying, he limped off, leaving my friend and me in admiration of his intrepidity and con|tent; nor could we avoid acknowledging, that an habitual acquaintance with mi&s;ery, is the true&s;t &s;chool of fortitude and philo&s;ophy. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXVI.</HI> From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>THE titles of European Princes are rather more numerous than ours of A&s;ia, but by no means &s;o &s;ublime. The king of Vi&s;apour or Pegu, not &s;atisfied with claiming the globe and all its appurtenances to him and his heirs, a&s;&s;erts a pro|perty even in the firmament, and extends his or|ders to the milky way. The monarchs of Europe, with more mode&s;ty, confine their titles to earth, but make up by number, what is wanting in their &s;ublimity. Such is their pa&s;&s;ion for a long li&s;t of the&s;e &s;plendid trifles, that I have known a Ger|man Prince with more titles than &s;ubjects, and a Spani&s;h nobleman with more names than &s;hirts.</P>
<P>Contrary to this, "The Engli&s;h monarchs, &s;ays a writer of the la&s;t century, di&s;dain to accept of &s;uch titles, which tend only to encrea&s;e their pride, without improving their glory; they are above depending on the feeble helps of heraldry for re&s;pect, perfectly &s;atisfied with the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of acknowledged power." At pre&s;ent, how|ever, the&s;e maxims are laid a&s;ide; the Engli&s;h monarchs have of late a&s;&s;umed new titles, and have impre&s;&s;ed their coins with the names and arms of ob&s;cure dukedoms, petty &s;tates, and &s;ub|ordinate employments. Their de&s;ign in this, I make no doubt, was laudably to add new lu&s;tre to the Briti&s;h throne, but in reality paltry claims only &s;erve to dimini&s;h that re&s;pect they are de&s;igned to &s;ecure.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="232">There is in the honours a&s;&s;umed by Kings, as in the decorations of architecture, a maje&s;tic &s;implicity, which be&s;t conduces to in&s;pire our reverence and re&s;pect; numerous and trifling or|naments in either, are &s;trong indications of mean|ne&s;s in the de&s;igner, or of concealed deformity: &s;hould, for in&s;tance, the Emperor of China, a|mong other titles, a&s;&s;ume that of Deputy Manda|rin of Maccau, or the Monarch of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, de&s;ire to be acknowledged as Duke of Brentford, Lunenburg, or Lincoln, the ob&s;erver revolts at this mixture of important and paltry claims, and forgets the Emperor in his familiarity with the Duke or the Deputy.</P>
<P>I remember a &s;imilar in&s;tance of this inverted ambition, in the illu&s;trious King of Manacabo, upon his fir&s;t treaty with the Portugue&s;e. Among the pre&s;ents that were made him by the amba&s;|&s;ador of that nation, was a &s;word, with a bra&s;s hilt, which he &s;eemed to &s;et a peculiar value upon. This he thought too great an acqui&s;ition to his glory, to be forgotten among the number of his titles. He therefore gave orders, that his &s;ub|jects &s;hould &s;tyle him for the future, <HI>Talipot, the immortal Potentate of Manacabo, Me&s;&s;enger of Morning, Enlightener of the Sun, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the the whole Earth, and mighty Monarch of the Bra&s;s-handled Sword.</HI></P>
<P>This method of mixing maje&s;tic and paltry ti|tles, of quartering the arms of a great Empire, and an ob&s;cure province, upon the &s;ame medal here, had its ri&s;e in the virtuous partiality of their late Monarchs. Willing to te&s;tify an affection to their native country, they gave its name and en&s;igns a
<PB N="225" REF="233">
place upon their coins, and thus in &s;ome mea&s;ure enobled its ob&s;curity. It was indeed but ju&s;t, that a people which had given England up their King, &s;hould receive &s;ome honorary equivalent in return; but at pre&s;ent the&s;e motives are no more; England has now a Monarch wholly Briti&s;h, and it has &s;ome rea&s;on to hope for Briti&s;h titles upon Briti&s;h coins.</P>
<P>However, were the money of England de&s;igned to circulate in Germany, there would be no fla|grant impropriety in impre&s;&s;ing it with German names and arms; but though this might have been &s;o upon former occa&s;ions, I am told there is no danger of it for the future; as England therefore de&s;igns to keep back its gold, I candidly think Lunenburg, Oldenburgh, and the re&s;t of them, may very well keep back their titles.</P>
<P>It is a mi&s;taken prejudice in Princes, to think that a number of loud &s;ounding names can give new claims to re&s;pect. The truly great have ever di&s;dained them: When Timur the Lame had conquered A&s;ia, an orator by profe&s;&s;ion came to compliment him upon the occa&s;ion. He began his harrangue, by &s;tyling him the mo&s;t omnipo|tent, and the mo&s;t glorious object of the creation; the Emperor &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed with his paltry adulation, yet &s;till he went on, complimenting him, as the mo&s;t mighty, the mo&s;t valiant, and the mo&s;t perfect of beings: Hold there, my friend, cries the lame Emperor; hold there, till I have got another leg. In fact, the feeble or the de&s;potic alone find plea&s;ure in multiplying the&s;e pageants of va|nity, but &s;trength and freedom have nobler aims,
<PB N="226" REF="234">
and often find the fine&s;t adulation in maje&s;tic &s;im|plicity.</P>
<P>The young Monarch of this country has al|ready te&s;tified a proper contempt for &s;everal un|meaning appendages on royalty; cooks and &s;cul|lions have been obliged to quit their fires; gentle|mens gentlemen, and the whole tribe of <HI>nece&s;&s;ary people,</HI> who did nothing, have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from further &s;ervices. A youth, who can thus bring back &s;implicity and frugality to a court, will &s;oon probably have a true re&s;pect for his own glory, and while he has di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all u&s;ele&s;s employments, may di&s;dain to accept of empty or degrading titles.

<P>WHENEVER I attempt to characterize the Engli&s;h in general; &s;ome unfore&s;een difficul|ties con&s;tantly occur to di&s;concert my de&s;ign; I he&s;itate between cen&s;ure and prai&s;e: when I con|&s;ider them as a rea&s;oning philo&s;ophical people, they have my applau&s;e; but when I rever&s;e the medal, and ob&s;erve their incon&s;tancy and irre&s;o|lution, I can &s;carcely per&s;uade my &s;elf that I am ob&s;erving the &s;ame people.</P>
<P>Yet upon examination this very incon&s;tancy, &s;o remarkable here, flows from no other &s;ource than
<PB N="227" REF="235">
their love of rea&s;oning. The man who examines a complicated &s;ubject on every &s;ide, and calls in rea&s;on to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will frequently change; will find him&s;elf di&s;tracted by oppo&s;ing proba|bilities and contending proofs: every alteration of place will diver&s;ify the pro&s;pect, will give &s;ome latent argument new force, aad contribute to maintain an anarchy in the mind.</P>
<P>On the contrary, they who never examine with their own rea&s;on, act with more &s;implicity. Igno|nance is po&s;itive, in&s;tinct per&s;everes, and the human being moves in &s;afety within the narrow circle of brutal uniformity. What is true with regard to individuals, is not le&s;s &s;o when applied to &s;tates A rea&s;oning government like this, is in continual fluctuation, while tho&s;e kingdoms where men are taught not to controvert but obey, continue always the &s;ame. In A&s;ia, for in&s;tance, where the monarch's authority is &s;upported by force, and acknowledged through fear, a change of government is entirely unknown. All the in|habitants &s;eem to wear the &s;ame mental complec|tion, and remain contented with hereditary op|pre&s;&s;ion. The &s;overeign's plea&s;ure is the ultimate rule of duty, every branch of the admini&s;tration is a perfect epitome of the whole; and if one tyrant is depo&s;ed, another &s;tarts up in his room to govern as his predece&s;&s;or. The Engli&s;h, on the contrary, in&s;tead of being led by power, en|deavour to guide them&s;elves by rea&s;on; in&s;tead of appealing to the plea&s;ure of the prince, appeal to the original rights of mankind. What one rank of men a&s;&s;ert is denied by others, as the rea&s;ons on oppo&s;ite &s;ides happen to come home with great|er
<PB N="228" REF="236">
or le&s;s conviction. The people of A&s;ia are directed by precedent, which never alters; the Engli&s;h by rea&s;on, which is ever changing its ap|pearance.</P>
<P>The di&s;advantages of an A&s;iatic government ac|ting in this manner by precedent are evident; ori|ginal errors are thus continued, without hopes of redre&s;s, and all marks of genius are levelled down to one &s;tandard, &s;ince no &s;uperiority of thinking can be allowed its exertion in mending obvious defects. But to recompence tho&s;e defects, their governments undergo no new alterations, they have no new evils to fear, nor no fermentations in the con&s;titution that continue: the &s;truggle for power is &s;oon over, and all becomes tranquil as before; they are habituated to &s;ubordination, and men are taught to form no other de&s;ires, than tho&s;e which they are allowed to &s;atisfy.</P>
<P>The di&s;advantages of a government acting from the immediate influence of rea&s;on, like that of England, are not le&s;s than tho&s;e of the former. It is extremely difficult to induce a number of free beings to co-operate for their mutual benefit; every po&s;&s;ible advantage will nece&s;&s;arily be &s;ought, and every attempt to procure it mu&s;t be attended with a new fermentation; various rea&s;ons will lead different ways, and equity and advantage will often be out-ballanced by a combination of cla|mour and prejudice. But though &s;uch a people may be thus in the wrong, they have been influ|enced by an happy delu&s;ion, their errors are &s;el|dom &s;een till they are felt; each man is him|&s;elf the tyrant he has obeyed, and &s;uch a ma&s;ter he can ea&s;ily forgive. The di&s;advantages he feels
<PB N="229" REF="237">
may in reality be equal to what is felt in the mo&s;t de&s;potic government; but man will bear every calamity with patience, when he knows him&s;elf to be the author of his own misfortunes. Adieu.</P>

<P>MY long re&s;idence here begins to fatigue me, as every object cea&s;es to be new, it no longer continues to be plea&s;ing; &s;ome minds are &s;o fond of variety that plea&s;ure it &s;elf, if permanent, would be in&s;upportable, and we are thus obliged to &s;olicit new happine&s;s even by courting di&s;tre&s;s: I only therefore wait the arrival of my &s;on to vary this trifling &s;cene, and borrow new plea&s;ure from danger and fatigue. A life, I own, thus &s;pent in wandring from place to place, is at be&s;t but empty di&s;&s;ipation. But to pur&s;ue trifles is the lot of humanity; and whether we bu&s;tle in a pantomime, or &s;trut at a coronation; whether we &s;hout at a bonefire, or harrangue in a &s;enate-hou&s;e; whatever object we follow, it will at la&s;t &s;urely conduct us to futility and di&s;appoint|ment. The wi&s;e bu&s;tle and laugh as they walk in the pageant, but fools bu&s;tle and are im|portant; and this probably is all the difference be|tween them.</P>
<P>This may be an apology for the levity of my for|mer corre&s;pondence; I talked of trifles, and I knew that they were trifles; to make the things of this life ridiculous, it was only &s;ufficient to call them by their names.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="238">In other re&s;pects, I have omitted &s;everal &s;tri|king circum&s;tances in the de&s;cription of this country, as &s;uppo&s;ing them either already known to you, or as not being thoroughly known to my&s;elf: But there is one omi&s;&s;ion for which I expect no forgivene&s;s, namely, my being totally &s;ilent upon their buildings, roads, rivers, and mountains. This is a branch of &s;cience on which all other travellers are &s;o very prolix, that my de|ficiency will appear the more glaring. With what plea&s;ure, for in&s;tance, do &s;ome read of a travel|ler in Egypt, mea&s;uring a fallen column with his cane, and finding it exactly five feet nine inches long; of his creeping through the mouth of a catacomb, and coming out by a different hole from that he entered; of his &s;tealing the finger of an antique &s;tatue, in &s;pite of the janizary that watch'd him; or his adding a new conjec|ture to the hundred and fourteen conjectures already publi&s;hed, upon the names of <HI>O&s;u is</HI> and <HI>I&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>Methinks I hear &s;ome of my friends in China de|manding a &s;imilar account of London and the adja|cent villages; and if I remain here much longer, it is probable I may gratify their curio&s;ity. I intend, when run dry on other topics, to take a &s;erious &s;urvey of the City-wall; to de&s;cribe that beauti|ful building the Man&s;ion-Hou&s;e; I will enume|rate the magnificent &s;quares, in which the nobility chiefly re&s;ide, and the Royal Palaces appointed for the reception of the Engli&s;h Monarch; nor will I forget the beauties of Shoe-Lane, in which I my &s;elf have re&s;ided &s;ince my arrival. You &s;hall find me no way inferior to many of my bro|ther travellers in the arts of de&s;cription. At pre|&s;ent,
<PB N="231" REF="239">
however as a &s;pecimen of this way of wri|ting, I &s;end you a few ha&s;ty remarks, collected in a late journey I made to Kenti&s;h Town, <HI>and this in the manner of modern voyagers.</HI></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>Having heard much of Kenti&s;h Town, I con|ceived a &s;trong de&s;ire to &s;ee that celebrated place. I could have wi&s;h'd indeed to &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity without going thither; but that was impracticable, and therefore I re&s;olved to go. Travellers have two methods of going to Kenti&s;h Town; they take coach which co&s;ts nine pence, or they may go a foot which co&s;ts nothing; in my opinion, a coach is by far the mo&s;t eligible convenience, but I was re&s;olved to go on foot, having con&s;idered with my &s;elf, that going in that manner would be the cheape&s;t way.</P><P>As you &s;et out from Dog-hou&s;e bar, you enter upon a fine level road railed in on both &s;ides, commanding on the right a fine pro&s;pect of groves, and fields, enamelled with flowers, which would wonderfully charm the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling, were it not for a dunghill on the left, which mixes its effluvia with their odours: This dunghill is of much greater antiquity than the road; and I mu&s;t not omit a piece of inju&s;tice I was going to commit upon this occa&s;ion. My indignation was levelled again&s;t the makers of the dunghill for having brought it &s;o near the road; whereas it &s;hould have fallen upon the makers of the road for having brought that &s;o near the dunghill.</P><P>After proceeding in this manner for &s;ome time, a building re&s;embling &s;omewhat a triumphal arch &s;alutes the traveller's view. This &s;tructure how|ever

is peculiar to this country, and vulgarly call'd a turnpike gate: I could perceive a long in&s;cription in large characters on the front, proba|bly upon the occa&s;ion of &s;ome triumph, but being in ha&s;te I left it to be made out by &s;ome &s;ub&s;e|quent adventurer who may happen to travel this way; &s;o continuing my cour&s;e to the we&s;t, I &s;oon arrived at an unwalled town called I&s;lington.</P><P>I&s;lington is a pretty neat town, mo&s;tly built of brick, with a church and bells: It has a &s;mall lake, or rather pond in the mid&s;t; tho' at pre&s;ent very much neglected.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXIX.</HI> To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a variety of di&s;apointments, my wi&s;hes are at length fully &s;atisfied. My &s;on &s;o long expected is arrived, at once, by his pre&s;ence bani&s;hing my anxiety, and opening a new &s;cene of unexpected plea&s;ure. His improvements in mind and per&s;on have far &s;urpa&s;s'd even the &s;an|guine expectations of a father. I left him a boy, but he is returned a man; plea&s;ing in his per&s;on, hardened by travel, and poli&s;hed by ad|ver&s;ity. His di&s;appointment in love, however, had infu&s;ed an air of melancholy into his conver&s;ation, which &s;eemed at intervals to interrupt our mu|tual &s;atisfaction. I expected that this could find a cure only from time; but fortune, as if wil|ling to load us with her favours, has in a mo|ment repaid every unea&s;ine&s;s with rapture.</P>
<P>Two days after his arrival, the man in black with his beautiful niece, came to congratulate us upon this plea&s;ing occa&s;ion: but, gue&s;s our &s;ur|prize, when my friend's lovely kin&s;woman was found to be the very captive my &s;on had re&s;cued from Per&s;ia, and who had been wreck'd on the Wolga, and was carried by the Ru&s;&s;ian pea|&s;ants
<PB N="235" REF="243">
to the port of Archangel. Were I to hold the pen of a noveli&s;t, I might be prolix in de|&s;cribing their feelings, at &s;o unexpected an in|terview; but you may conceive their joy, with|out my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, words were unable to expre&s;s their tran&s;ports, then how can words de&s;cribe it?</P>
<P>When two young per&s;ons are &s;incerely ena|moured of each other, nothing can give me &s;uch plea&s;ure as &s;eeing them married: whether I know the parties or not, I am happy at thus binding one link more in the univer&s;al chain. Nature has, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, formed me for a match-maker, and given me a &s;oul to &s;ympathize with every mode of human felicity. I in&s;tantly therefore con|&s;ulted the man in black, whether we might not crown their mutual wi&s;hes by marriage; his &s;oul &s;eems formed of &s;imilar materials with mine, he in&s;tantly gave his con&s;ent, and the next day was appointed for the &s;olemnization of their nuptials.</P>
<P>All the acquaintances which I had made &s;ince my arrival, were pre&s;ent at this gay &s;olemnity. The little beau was con&s;tituted ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, and his wife Mrs. Tibbs conducted the entertainment with proper decorum. The man in black and the pawn-broker's widow, were very &s;prightly and tender upon this occa&s;ion. The widow was dre&s;&s;ed up under the direction of Mrs. Tibbs; and as for her lover, his face was &s;et off by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a pig-tail wig, which was lent by the little beau, to fit him for making love with proper formality. The whole company ea&s;ily perceived, that it would be a double wedding before all was over, and indeed
<PB N="236" REF="244">
my friend and the widow &s;eemed to make no &s;e|cret of their pa&s;&s;ion; he even called me a&s;ide, in order to know my candid opinion, whether I did not think him a little too old to be married. As for my own part, continued he, I know I am go|ing to play the fool, but all my friends will prai&s;e my wi&s;dom, and produce me as the very pattern of di&s;cretion to others.</P>
<P>At dinner, every thing &s;eemed to run on with good humour, harmony, and &s;atisfaction. Every creature in company thought them&s;elves pretty, and every je&s;t was laught at: the man in black &s;at next his mi&s;tre&s;s, helped her plate, chimed her gla&s;s, and jogging her knees and her elbow, he whi&s;pered &s;omething arch in her ear, on which &s;he patted his cheek; never was antiquated pa&s;&s;ion &s;o playful, &s;o harmle&s;s, and amu&s;ing, as between this reverend couple.</P>
<P>The &s;econd cour&s;e was now called for, and among a variety of other Di&s;hes, a fine turkey was placed before the widow. The Europeans, you know, carve as they eat; my friend therefore begged his mi&s;tre&s;s to help him to a part of the turkey. The widow, plea&s;ed with an opportu|nity of &s;hewing her &s;kill in carving; an art, upon which it &s;eems, &s;he picqued her&s;elf; began to cut it up by fir&s;t taking off the leg. <HI>Madam,</HI> cries my friend, <HI>if I might be permitted to adv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, I would begin by cutting off the wing, and then the Leg will come off more ea&s;ily.</HI> Sir, replies the widow, give me leave to under&s;tand cutting up a fowl, I always begin with the leg. <HI>Yes Madam,</HI> re|plies the lover, <HI>but if the wing be the mo&s;t convenient
<PB N="237" REF="245">
manner, I would begin with the wing.</HI> Sir, inter|rupts the lady, when you have fowls of your own, begin with the wing if you plea&s;e; but give me leave to take off the leg, I hope I am not to be taught at this time of day. <HI>Madam,</HI> interrupts he, <HI>we are never too old to be in&s;tructed.</HI> Old, Sir! interrupts the other, who is old, Sir? when I die of age, I know of &s;ome that will quake for fear; if the leg does not come off, take the turkey to your|&s;elf. <HI>Madam,</HI> replied the man in black, <HI>I don't care a farthing whether the leg or the wing comes off; if you are for the leg fir&s;t, why you &s;hall have the argument, even though it be as I &s;ay.</HI> As for the matter of that, cries the widow, I don't care a fig, whether you are for the leg off, or on; and friend, for the future keep your di&s;|tance. <HI>O,</HI> replied the other, <HI>that is ea&s;ily done, it is only removing to the other end of the table, and &s;o, madam, your mo&s;t obedient humble &s;ervant.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, was this court&s;hip of an age de&s;troyed in one moment; for this dialogue effectually broke off the match between this re&s;pectable couple, that had been but ju&s;t concluded. The &s;malle&s;t accidents di&s;appoint the mo&s;t important treaties: However, though it in &s;ome mea&s;ure interrupted the general &s;atisfaction, it no ways le&s;&s;ened the happine&s;s of the youthful couple; and by the young lady's looks I could perceive, &s;he was not entirely di&s;|plea&s;ed with this interruption.</P>
<P>In a few hours the whole tran&s;action &s;eemed entirely forgotten, and we have all &s;ince, enjoyed tho&s;e &s;atisfactions which re&s;ult from a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of making each other happy. My &s;on and
<PB N="238" REF="246">
his fair partner are fixed here for life; the man in black, has given them up a &s;mall e&s;tate in the country, which added to what I was able to be&s;tow, will be capable of &s;upplying all the real, but not the fictitious demands of happine&s;s. As for my&s;elf, the world being but one city to me, I don't much care in which of the &s;treets I happen to re&s;ide; I &s;hall therefore &s;pend the re|mainder of life, in examining the manners of dif|ferent countries, and have prevailed upon the man in black to be my companion. <HI>They mu&s;t often change, &s;ays</HI> Confucius, <HI>who would be con&s;tant in happine&s;s or wi&s;dom.</HI> Adieu.</P>
