<P>THIS little piece is the com|po&s;ition of one of the great|e&s;t arti&s;ts that ever was in Scotland; who, be&s;ides his &s;uperior excellence in his profe&s;&s;ion, which was <HI>Draw|ing,</HI> the principal part of Painting, was very learned in all the Italian Arts; and particularly in their Poe|try and Mu&s;ic, the &s;ubject of this little work, more learned, I believe, than any man in Great Britain.

As Beauty is pretty much the &s;ame in all the Fine Arts, there being a cognation, as Cicero expre&s;&s;es it, by which they are connected and related more or le&s;s to one another, Mr Brown has &s;hown, in this work, that he knew very well what Beau|ty was in Writing as well as in o|ther Arts; for there is in his &s;tile a copiou&s;ne&s;s and elegance, and withal an accuracy of expre&s;&s;ion, which are &s;eldom to be met with in the compo&s;itions of this age; and, both for matter and &s;tile, I will venture to &s;et this little piece again&s;t any thing that has been written en the &s;ubject of the Fine
<PB N="v" REF="5">
Arts in modern times; and, I am per&s;uaded, it would have been &s;till more perfect in every re&s;pect, if he had lived to publi&s;h it him&s;elf. He has explained mo&s;t accurately every thing belonging to the Italian Opera, beginning with the <HI>Recitative,</HI> by which the bu&s;ine&s;s or action of the Opera, the principal thing in all dramatic performances, is carried on; and then proceeding to the <HI>Airs</HI> or <HI>Songs,</HI> by which the &s;enti|ments and pa&s;&s;ions of the <HI>Dramatis Per&s;onae</HI> are expre&s;&s;ed.

<PB N="viii" REF="8">
dancing that the above mentioned Airs have to expre&s;&s;ive Mu&s;ic.'</Q> And, in the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age, he ob|&s;erves, that this admiration of the new and difficult, which begins to prevail in Italy, is a &s;ymptom of the decline of the Arts there; &s;o that he appears to me to have had a ta&s;te, not only &s;uperior to what is to be found in Britain, but even to the ta&s;te at pre&s;ent in Italy, the country of the Fine Arts; and I have heard from others, as well as from him, that the burletta, and the ta&s;te for the ridiculous, is pre|vailing very much in Italy, than which there can be no &s;urer &s;ign of
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
the decline of genius and ta&s;te in a nation. But the &s;erious Italian Opera, as he has de&s;cribed it, and as it is acted in Rome, though it may not be &s;o perfect as it for|merly was, is &s;till the mo&s;t perfect junction of Poetry, Mu&s;ic, and Ac|tion, (or Dancing, as the ancients called it, which, among them, was an Art of Imitation, as well as Poetry and Mu&s;ic), the three fine&s;t of the Fine Arts, that is now to be found in the world, and &s;uch as only can give us any idea of <HI>Attic Tragedies, of &s;tatelie&s;t and mo&s;t regal argument,</HI> (to u&s;e an expre&s;|&s;ion of Milton), with which that

learned and elegant people were &s;o much delighted, and, upon the repre&s;entation of which they be|&s;towed the greate&s;t part of the re|venue of their &s;tate. This work, therefore, of Mr Brown, will give great plea&s;ure, not only to the Connoi&s;&s;eurs in Mu&s;ic, but al&s;o, I hope, to all the admirers of anci|ent Arts; and I am &s;ure that all tho&s;e who were acquainted with him, and knew him to be a man of great worth as well as genius, will be very glad to encourage this publication for the benefit of his widow and child.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN order to give your Lord&s;hip a di&s;tinct idea, not only of the va|rious kinds of ver&s;e made u&s;e of by the Italians in their Opera, but of the principles al&s;o by which the application of that variety is directed, I find it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to take into con&s;ideration the union of poetry and mu&s;ic, which is
<PB N="2" REF="22">
peculiar to this &s;pecies of drama. The nature of this union &s;eems to have been well under&s;tood by their be&s;t dramatic writers, and they have &s;eldom lo&s;t &s;ight of it in their works; whil&s;t tho&s;e of our poets, who have written Cantatas or other compo&s;itions for mu&s;ic, appear either to have been not at all acquainted with it, or, if they were, to have totally di&s;regarded it. The Italians have, with great propri|ety, con&s;idered, that the &s;peeches in the drama, whether in dialogue or &s;olilo|quy, mu&s;t be either &s;uch as are ex|pre&s;&s;ive of pa&s;&s;ion and &s;entiment, or &s;uch as are not &s;o. On this real di|&s;tinction, and not, as with us, on the mere caprice of the compo&s;er, is found|ed
<PB N="3" REF="23">
their fir&s;t great divi&s;ion of vocal mu&s;ic into <HI>recitative</HI> and <HI>air.</HI> It is e|vident, on the &s;lighte&s;t con&s;ideration, that, in the progre&s;s of the drama, many pa&s;&s;ages mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occur, &s;uch as &s;imple narration of facts, di|rections given, plain an&s;wers made to plain que&s;tions, &s;ometimes ab&s;tract truths or moral reflections;&mdash;none of which, as they contain nothing of pa&s;&s;ion or &s;entiment, can ever become the &s;ubject of mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion. Sim|ply to have &s;poken the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, how|ever, and then abruptly to have &s;et up a &s;inging, when any pathetic part pre&s;ented it&s;elf, would have produced exactly that barbarous jumble of pro&s;e and poetry, of mu&s;ic and di&s;&s;onance,
<PB N="4" REF="24">
which characterizes the Engli&s;h comic opera. To avoid this, and, at the &s;ame time, not idly to be&s;tow the charms of fancy and feeling, where embelli&s;h|ment and expre&s;&s;ion would be im|proper, the Italians have invented that &s;pecies of &s;inging termed by them <HI>&s;im|ple recitative.</HI> Its name almo&s;t &s;uffici|ently explains its nature: It is a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of notes &s;o arranged as to coin|cide with the laws of harmony, tho' never accompanied but by a &s;ingle in&s;trument, who&s;e office is merely to &s;upport the voice, and to direct it in its modulations. Though, for the &s;ake of this accompanyment, recitative is, like other mu&s;ic, divided into bars, yet are not the&s;e bars, as in other
<PB N="5" REF="25">
mu&s;ic, nece&s;&s;arily of equal lengths; the notes of which they are compo&s;ed being &s;ubjected to no preci&s;e mu&s;ical mea&s;ure, but regulated, in this re|&s;pect, almo&s;t wholly by the natural pro&s;ody of the language. Thus, this kind of recitative an&s;wers completely its end: It detains the audience very little longer than the &s;poken recital would do; and, being mu&s;ic it&s;elf, the tran&s;ition from it to the higher and more intere&s;ting parts is perfectly na|tural, and agreeable to the ear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to your Lord&s;hip's opinion that there is &s;carcely any &s;uch thing as long and &s;hort &s;yllables in modern languages, the notes of the Italian recitative would be all of equal lengths. To obviate this objection, I mu&s;t take notice, that what your Lord&s;hip would call the <HI>accented</HI> &s;yllable, they e&s;teem the <HI>long</HI> one; and whatever may be the ca&s;e in &s;peech, in pronouncing the recitative, they mo&s;t certainly render it longer, in the pro|portion, generally, of <HI>two</HI> to <HI>one.</HI> Thus, the words <HI>&abreve;m&omacr;, t&abreve;l&omacr;r, c&ebreve;d&emacr;, f&ibreve;n&imacr;, t&obreve;rn&amacr;i,</HI> in which the accent is laid on the la&s;t &s;yllable, are, in recitative, po&s;itively iambics, the fir&s;t &s;ylla|ble being expre&s;&s;ed by a quaver, the other by a crotchet, thus, <HI>&abreve;m&omacr;, t&abreve;l&omacr;r,</HI> &notequaver;&notecrotchet; &notequaver;&notecrotchet; &amp;c. the la&s;t of which characters is the &s;ign of a duration of time, exactly double the length of that denoted by the fir&s;t. Tho&s;e again which have the ac|cent on the fir&s;t &s;yllable, as <HI>&amacr;m&obreve;, b&emacr;n&ebreve;, ci&emacr;l&obreve;, tr&omacr;mb&abreve;,</HI> &notecrotchet;&notequaver; &notecrotchet;&notequaver; &notecrotchet;&notequaver; &notecrotchet;&notequaver; are trochaics. All the Articles of two &s;yllables, &s;uch as <HI>delle, alli,</HI> &amp;c. and the Pronouns per&s;onal when joined with another mono&s;yllable, &s;uch as <HI>mene, celo, vela, ti&s;&s;i, glielo,</HI> &amp;c. may, with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety, be con&s;idered as each a pyrrhic foot, which, in recitative, would accordingly be expre&s;&s;ed bv two quavers, <HI>m&ebreve;n&ebreve;, c&ebreve;l&obreve;,</HI> &notequaver;&notequaver; &notequaver;&notequaver;&amp;c. The words <HI>d&omacr;c&ibreve;l&ebreve;, fl&emacr;b&ibreve;l&ebreve;, m&omacr;rm&obreve;r&abreve;,</HI> &notecrotchet;&notequaver;&notequaver; &notecrotchet;&notequaver;&notequaver; &notecrotchet;&notequaver;&notequaver; are thus real dactyles, whil&s;t &s;uch as the&s;e again, <HI>t&ibreve;m&omacr;r&ebreve;, &obreve;n&omacr;r&ebreve;,</HI> &amp;c. &notequaver;&notecrotchet;&notequaver; &notequaver;&notecrotchet;&notequaver; are, to all intents and purpo&s;es, each a foot, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;hort, a long, and a &s;hort &s;yl|lable. Nay, I may go &s;o far as to &s;ay, that no &s;pecies of foot occurs in the ancient poetry which is not frequently to be found in the Italian recitative, in which three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;hort, three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive long &s;yllables, and often four of each are to be found, and, indeed, all the po&s;&s;ible varieties in which long and &s;hort &s;yllables can be combined together. Now, though it be allowed that the Italian ver&s;e is formed, not by the number of feet, but of &s;yllables, it is fair to conclude, that this manner of reciting it, by which not only va|rious combinations of them are formed, but their re&s;pective length and brevity po&s;itively a&s;certained, mu&s;t not only give additional beauty and variety to the ver&s;e, but render the pro|nunciation it&s;elf more clear and explicit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="26">The ver&s;e appropriated to recitative is of a mixed kind, con&s;i&s;ting of the
<PB N="7" REF="27">
heroic line of eleven &s;yllables, and of a line of &s;even &s;yllables, with now and
<PB N="8" REF="28">
then a rhyme. In the intermingling, however, the&s;e lines with each other,
<PB N="9" REF="29">
as well as with re&s;pect to the intro|duction of the rhymes, the poet is entirely left to the guidance of his own ear and &s;entiment. This kind of mixed ver&s;e, from the variety of the cadences which it affords, &s;eems well calculated to give to the recitative as marked a re&s;emblance to common &s;peech as is con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity and beauty of numbers; whil&s;t the &s;pa|ring and judicious introduction of rhyme, either to fini&s;h more highly &s;ome beautiful pa&s;&s;age, or more &s;trongly to point &s;ome remarkable a&s;&s;ertion or
<PB N="10" REF="30">
reflection, &s;erves to pre&s;erve through|out the piece a proper degree of u|nity of effect, by preventing that irk|&s;ome and unnatural di&s;&s;imilarity be|tween the recitative and the airs, which would, in &s;ome degree, be the con&s;e|quence of the want of this kind of medium. Upon the whole, it appears admirably well &s;uited to the le&s;s im|portant parts of a production &s;o refined and artificial as the Opera, who&s;e ob|ject, like that of the arts of painting and &s;culpture among&s;t the ancients, is not &s;o much the exact imitation of nature, as the union in as high a de|gree as po&s;&s;ible of what is beautiful with what is natural.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the former &s;heets I have endea|voured to explain to your Lord|&s;hip the nature of &s;imple recitative, and to de&s;cribe the kind of ver&s;e appro|priated to it. I proceed now to treat of the higher parts of vocal mu&s;ic, tho&s;e, namely, which are adapted to the more intere&s;ting and pathetic pa&s;|&s;ages of the drama. With re&s;pect to

the&s;e, di&s;tinctions have been likewi&s;e made by the Italians, which &s;eem perfectly well founded. They mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, have ob&s;erved, that all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in which the mind of the &s;peaker is agitated by a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of various emotions, are, from their nature, incompatible with any particular &s;train, or length of me|lody; for that which con&s;titutes &s;uch particular &s;train is the relation of &s;eve|ral parts to one whole. Now, it is this whole which the Italians di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of <HI>motivo,</HI> which may be tran&s;lated <HI>&s;train,</HI> or <HI>&s;ubject of the air,</HI> and which they conceive to be incon|&s;i&s;tent with the brevity and de&s;ultory &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e ejaculations, which are
<PB N="13" REF="35">
the effect of a high degree of agitation. Air they think even inadmi&s;&s;ible in tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, in which, though the emotions be not various, yet the &s;entences are broken and incoherent. To give an in&s;tance: The following &s;peech, tho' terror be uniformly expre&s;&s;ed by the whole of it, &s;eems not at all a &s;ubject fit to be comprehended under, or ex|pre&s;&s;ed by one regular &s;train:
<Q><L>Bring me unto my trial when you will.&mdash;</L>
<L>Dy'd he not in his bed?&mdash;Where &s;hould he die?</L>
<L>Oh! torture me no more&mdash;I will confe&s;s.&mdash;</L>
<L>Alive again!&mdash;then &s;hew me where he is;</L>
<L>I'll give a thou&s;and pounds to look on him.</L>
<L>&mdash;He hath no eyes;&mdash;the du&s;t hath blinded them&mdash;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="36">Comb down his hair&mdash;look! look! it &s;tands up|right</L>
<L>Like lime-twigs &s;et to catch my winged &s;oul.&mdash;</L>
<L>Give me &s;ome drink, &amp;c.&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE's <HI>Henry</HI> VI.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>But, whil&s;t the Italians conceived &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages to be incompatible with that regularity of mea&s;ure, and that u|nity of &s;train which is e&s;&s;ential to air, they felt, however, that they were of all others the mo&s;t proper &s;ubject for mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion: And, accordingly, both the poet and mu&s;ician &s;eem, by mutual con&s;ent, to have be&s;towed on &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages their chief &s;tudy; and the mu&s;ician, in particular, never fails to exert on them his highe&s;t and mo&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="37">
brilliant powers. It is to them they adapt that &s;pecies of recitative termed <HI>recitativo in&s;trumentato,</HI> or <HI>recitativo o|bligato,&mdash;accompanied recitative.</HI> In this kind of recitative the &s;inger is, in a more &s;pecial manner, left to the dictates of his own feelings and judg|ment with re&s;pect to the mea&s;ure: He mu&s;t not indeed rever&s;e the natural pro&s;ody of the language, by making &s;hort what &s;hould be long, or <HI>vice ver|&s;a</HI>; but he may not only proportion|ally lengthen the duration of each &s;yl|lable, but he may give to particular &s;yllables what length he plea&s;es, and precipitate con&s;iderably the pronuncia|tion of others, ju&s;t as he thinks the ex|pre&s;&s;ion requires. The march of the
<PB N="16" REF="38">
notes is very different in this from that of the common or &s;imple recitative; delicacy, pathos, force, dignity, accor|ding to the different expre&s;&s;ions of the words, are its characteri&s;tics. It is in this &s;pecies of &s;ong that the fine&s;t effects of the chromatic, and, as far as our &s;y&s;tem of mu&s;ical intervals is &s;u&s;cepti|ble of it, even of the enharmonic &s;cale, are peculiarly felt; and it is here al&s;o that the powers of modulation are mo&s;t happily, becau&s;e mo&s;t properly, em|ployed, by changes of tone analogous to the variety of the matter, in a won|derful manner enforcing and character|izing the tran&s;itions which are made from one &s;ubject or emotion to ano|ther. Here, too, the whole orche&s;tra
<PB N="17" REF="39">
lends its aid; nor are the in&s;truments limited to the &s;imple duty of &s;upport|ing and directing the voice. In this high &s;pecies of recitative it is the pe|culiar province of the in&s;trumental parts, during tho&s;e pau&s;es which natu|rally take place between the bur&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion which a mind &s;trongly agitated breaks into, to produce &s;uch &s;ounds as &s;erve to awake in the audience &s;en&s;a|tions and emotions &s;imilar to tho&s;e which are &s;uppo&s;ed to agitate the &s;peak|er. Here, again, another fine di&s;tinction is made by the Italians, between the de|&s;criptive and the pathetic powers of mu|&s;ic. The&s;e la&s;t are proper to the voice, the former to the orche&s;tra alone. Thus, the &s;ymphonies which accompany this
<PB N="18" REF="40">
kind of recitative, be&s;ides the general analogy they mu&s;t have to the imme|diate &s;entiments, and even to the cha|racter, of the &s;peaker, are often parti|cularly de&s;criptive of the place in which he is, or of &s;ome other concomitant circum&s;tance which may &s;erve to heigh|ten the effect of the &s;peech it&s;elf. Sup|po&s;e, for example, the &s;cene to be a pri&s;on; the &s;ymphonies, whil&s;t they accord with the general tenor of the words, will paint, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, the horrors of the dun|geon it&s;elf:&mdash;And I can a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip that I have heard &s;ymphonies of this kind &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of &s;uch horrors. Again, &s;uppo&s;e the &s;cene by moon light and the general tone of
<PB N="19" REF="41">
the pa&s;&s;ion plaintive, the &s;weetne&s;s, the &s;erenity, and, (though to tho&s;e, who have never experienced the effects of mu&s;ic in this degree, it may &s;eem pa|radoxical to &s;ay &s;o), even the &s;olitude, nay, the &s;ilence of the &s;cene, would make part of the ideas &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;ymphonies. Should a &s;torm be introduced, the &s;kilful compo&s;er would contrive to make the rain beat, and the tempe&s;t howl mo&s;t fearfully, by means of the orche&s;tra: Nay, in a &s;cene &s;uch as that of the dying Beau|fort, which I have quoted above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 13.</NOTE> to your Lord&s;hip, the mu&s;ician, follow|ing clo&s;e the wild ravings of the &s;peak|er, would, during the pau&s;es of the
<PB N="20" REF="42">
&s;peech, call forth from the in&s;truments &s;uch &s;ounds as would thrill with terror the audience, by realizing, in a man|ner, to their &s;en&s;e and feeling, the hor|rible apprehen&s;ions of his di&s;tracted mind. But the combined powers of melody and harmony are never more effectually felt than when, in this kind of recitative, they are employed to mark &s;ome very &s;triking tran&s;ition. In a &s;cene of madne&s;s, for example, where the imagination of the &s;peaker is &s;up|po&s;ed to &s;tart from a gloomy de&s;art to flowery meads, the orche&s;tra would, by an immediate change of mea&s;ure, of melody, of harmony, perhaps of &s;ounds too, mark the tran&s;ition&mdash;would proceed to &s;pread out the &s;miling land|&s;kip, to adorn it with gaye&s;t flowers,
<PB N="21" REF="43">
to awake the zephyr, and, in &s;hort, give to the audience, by means of a wonderful analogy of &s;ounds, the mo&s;t lively repre&s;entation of the new image which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the madman's mind.&mdash;The&s;e are effects of what I have ventured to call the De&s;criptive, or Imitative, powers of mu&s;ic. With re&s;pect to the tran&s;i|tions of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as from tender|ne&s;s to jealou&s;y, from joy to anger, &amp;c. the&s;e belong to the Pathetic pow|ers of mu&s;ic, and are the peculiar pro|vince of the vocal part. Often, in the middle of a very agitated Recitative, on the occurrence of &s;ome tender idea, on which the mind is &s;uppo&s;ed to dwell with a kind of melancholy plea&s;ure,
<PB N="22" REF="44">
the mu&s;ic lo&s;es, by degrees, the irre|gular character of Recitative, and re|&s;olves gradually into the even mea&s;ure and continued melody of Air,&mdash;then, on a &s;udden, at the call of &s;ome idea of an oppo&s;ite nature, breaks off again into its former irregularity. This change from Recitative to Air, and thence to Recitative again, never fails, when pro|perly introduced, to have a very &s;trik|ing and beautiful effect. Whil&s;t it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the orche&s;tra thus clo&s;ely to accompany the &s;entiments and &s;itua|tion of the &s;inger, the actor, in his turn, as there is no note without a meaning, mu&s;t be continually attentive to the orche&s;tra: During tho&s;e inter|vals, in which the in&s;truments may be
<PB N="23" REF="45">
&s;aid to &s;peak, his action mu&s;t be in &s;trick concert with the mu&s;ic; every thing mu&s;t tend to the &s;ame point; &s;o that the poet, the mu&s;ician, the actor, mu&s;t all &s;eem to be informed by one &s;oul.&mdash;If your Lord&s;hip, to the na|tural voice of pa&s;&s;ion, and the proper and graceful expre&s;&s;ion of action, ima|gines, thus united, the intrin&s;ic charm of &s;ound it&s;elf, and the wonderful pow|ers of melody and harmony, I hope you will join with me in opinion, that the effect produced by &s;uch union is much richer, much more beautiful, much more powerful and affecting, than any that can be produced by &s;im|ple declamation. Though, in pa&s;&s;ages of this de&s;cription, the language ought
<PB N="24" REF="46">
certainly to ri&s;e with the &s;ubject, yet the ver&s;e which is here made u&s;e of, is of the &s;ame kind with that employed in the common Recitative, as being that which has the greate&s;t variety, and &s;uf|fers the fewe&s;t re&s;trictions, and, as &s;uch, the be&s;t adapted to the irregular nature of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages.&mdash;Having thus en|deavoured to explain to your Lord&s;hip the nature of <HI>recitative, &s;imple and ac|companied,</HI> of tho&s;e di&s;tinctions on which they are re&s;pectively founded, and of the &s;pecies of ver&s;e in which they are written, I proceed to treat of Air, and of the different kinds of ver&s;i|fication which are employed in it. As to the principles which direct the choice in adapting particular mea&s;ures to par|ticular
<PB N="25" REF="47">
airs, I &s;hall have nothing to &s;ay, they being exactly the &s;ame with tho&s;e by which the lyric poet adapts the ver&s;e to the various &s;ubject of an ode;&mdash;the heroic to the grave and &s;ublime;&mdash;that which &s;till partakes of dignity, though rather &s;mooth than grand, to the tender and pathetic;&mdash;that which is more violent and unequal, to the highly impa&s;&s;ioned parts;&mdash;and that which is of the airy dancing kind, to the lighter and more lively pa&s;&s;ages of the piece: Di&s;tinctions, which, it may be ob&s;erved, are evidently con&s;equences of the original union of poetry and mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>I am well aware, that great part of what I have here &s;aid of the power of
<PB N="26" REF="48">
the Italian mu&s;ic would, to many, per|haps to mo&s;t people, appear the lan|guage rather of enthu&s;ia&s;m than of any thing el&s;e: Perhaps it partly is &s;o; for my own feelings, on the authority alone of which I &s;peak, may, in &s;ome degree, proceed from enthu&s;ia&s;m. Whether this be the ca&s;e, or whether the effects I mention be completely real, but take place in con&s;equence of certain &s;en&s;ibi|lities, &s;o partially di&s;tributed among mankind, that, perhaps, even the le&s;&s;er number are &s;u&s;ceptible of the&s;e effects, I do not pre&s;ume to determine. If this la&s;t be the ca&s;e, (and there is no ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing it to be &s;o), it is evident, however, that tho&s;e who pro|fe&s;s &s;o great a degree of &s;en&s;ibility to
<PB N="27" REF="49">
the powers of mu&s;ic, will be very apt to appear affected and enthu&s;ia&s;tic to the re&s;t of mankind, who are, &s;urely, in &s;ome degree, ju&s;tified for calling in que&s;tion the exi&s;tence of plea&s;ures to which, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ame organs, all in &s;eeming equal perfection, they find them&s;elves perfect &s;trangers: Whil&s;t, on the other hand, tho&s;e who acknow|ledge the power of mu&s;ic, will think they have a complete right to a&s;&s;ert the reality of that of which they have &s;o feeling a conviction. For my own part, I am firmly per&s;uaded, that what I have ventured to advance to your Lord&s;hip touching the effects of mu&s;ic, is not at all exaggerated with re&s;pect to the feelings of thou&s;ands be&s;ides my|&s;elf:
<PB N="28" REF="50">
Nay, it is my opinion, that, were mu&s;ical entertainments arrived to that degree of perfection to which they might be brought, they could not fail of producing effects much more pow|erful than any I ever had an opportu|nity of experiencing.</P>

<P>RECITATIVE and Air may be con|&s;idered as <HI>genera</HI> in mu&s;ic, and the different kinds of each as <HI>&s;pecies.</HI></P>
<P>What I have already had the honour of &s;ubmitting to your Lord&s;hip's peru|&s;al, on the &s;ubject of Recitative, may &s;erve partly to explain the nature of Air. All tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages where the
<PB N="30" REF="52">
tran&s;ition from one emotion to another is &s;udden and violent, and which, therefore, can neither, on account of their brevity, make each a whole of it|&s;elf, nor, by rea&s;on of their variety, be made parts of the &s;ame whole, are ex|pre&s;&s;ed in Recitative. Tho&s;e, on the other hand, in which one &s;entiment pervades a whole &s;entence compo&s;ed of different parts, become proper &s;ub|jects for Air; and, indeed, every com|plete mu&s;ical &s;train may, with great ju&s;tne&s;s, be termed a &s;entence or pe|riod in melody.&mdash;Before proceeding to &s;peak of the different kinds of Airs, it may not be improper to &s;ay &s;ome|thing of the Symphony by which they are in general preceded. This Sym|phony
<PB N="31" REF="53">
is the enunciation, by the or|che&s;tra, of the &s;train or &s;ubject, what the Italians call the <HI>motivo</HI> of the Air; and when not improperly introduced, (which it always is when the &s;en&s;e ad|mits not of any pau&s;e), &s;erves &s;everal u&s;eful purpo&s;es;&mdash;it gives time to the &s;inger to breathe, already, perhaps, fa|tigued by a long recitative;&mdash;it often fills up, with propriety, a natural pau&s;e, and always finely prepares the audi|ence for what is to come after, by e|nabling them, having thus once heard the &s;train, to li&s;ten with more intelli|gence, and, of con&s;equence, with more intere&s;t and plea&s;ure to the &s;ong. Be|&s;ides, the general <HI>u&s;e</HI> of the Symphony, renders the <HI>omi&s;&s;ion</HI> of it, on particular
<PB N="32" REF="54">
occa&s;ions, beautiful and &s;triking.&mdash;Thus, for example, at the end of a Recitative, or at the beginning of a &s;cene, when the audience are expecting, as u&s;ual, the preparatory Symphony to the Air, they are &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed by the violent bur&s;t of &s;ome impetuous pa&s;&s;ion, which admitted of no po&s;&s;ible pau&s;e. The propriety of having, in &s;uch a circum&s;tance, omitted the Sym|phony, comes forcibly on the mind, as, <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> the effect of the omi&s;|&s;ion here confirms the propriety of u|&s;ing it where the &s;en&s;e allows it to be introduced. Sometimes, again, the Symphony is omitted in a very differ|ent manner, tho' with equal propriety: When, for in&s;tance, in an accompa|nied
<PB N="33" REF="55">
recitative, after a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of very different emotions, &s;ome &s;entiment is &s;uppo&s;ed to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind, related to that which is to be the &s;ubject of the Air, and to which it is afterwards led by a gradation of kindred emotions:&mdash;The progre&s;s, in this ca&s;e, from Recitative to Air, is &s;o gentle, that the audience frequently find them&s;elves melting into tears at the affecting and continued melody of the Air, before they are aware that the Recitative is ended. This imper|ceptible tran&s;ition is effected &s;ometime by &s;ubjecting the recitative it&s;elf to mu&s;ical mea&s;ure, and making the notes of it, by degrees, take a re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the Air. At other times,
<PB N="34" REF="56">
it is brought about by introducing, in the in&s;trumental parts, during the pau&s;es of the Recitative, pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;train which is to make the &s;ubject of the Air: Sometimes by both the&s;e means. The effect of this gradual tran&s;ition is always very fine, and, as your Lord&s;hip will ob&s;erve, is, in part, derived from that habitual di&s;tinction which the audience are accu&s;tomed to make between Recitative and Air.&mdash;As to the Airs them&s;elves, your Lord&s;hip will conceive that they are as various as their &s;ubjects. The&s;e are every po&s;|&s;ible &s;entiment, affection, or pa&s;&s;ion, the expre&s;&s;ion of which is extended through one &s;entence of a certain length: &s;uch &s;entences as the&s;e,&mdash;<HI>I</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="57"> <HI>love&mdash;I fear his wrath&mdash;I mourn her lo&s;s</HI>&mdash;though all proper &s;ubjects for mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion, being evidently too &s;hort to afford matter for a &s;train or melody, which, however &s;imple, mu&s;t &s;till be compo&s;ed of parts, the relations of which to one another, and to one whole, con&s;titute, indeed, the e&s;&s;ence of &s;uch &s;train.&mdash;The Air, though it mu&s;t contain at lea&s;t one complete &s;en|tence, is not, however, limited to one alone: It is often compo&s;ed of two, &s;ometimes of more parts; but the&s;e, whether related by analogy or by con|tra&s;t to the principal one, mu&s;t each &s;trictly belong to the &s;ame whole. The Airs are divided, by the Italians, into certain cla&s;&s;es; the&s;e cla&s;&s;es are
<PB N="36" REF="58">
originally founded on real di&s;tinctions, drawn from the nature of the various affections of the mind; but mu&s;icians, who, like other arti&s;ts, are &s;eldom phi|lo&s;ophers, have di&s;tingui&s;hed them by names relative to the practice of their own profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash;The principal are the following:</P>
<P><HI>Aria Cantabile,</HI>&mdash;by pre-eminence &s;o called, as if it alone were Song: And, indeed, it is the only kind of &s;ong which gives the &s;inger an oppor|tunity of di&s;playing at once, and in the highe&s;t degree, all his powers, of whatever de&s;cription they be. The proper &s;ubjects for this Air are &s;enti|ments of tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="59"><HI>Aria di portamento,</HI>&mdash;a denomination expre&s;&s;ive of the carriage, (as they thus call it), of the voice. This kind of Air is chiefly compo&s;ed of long notes, &s;uch as the &s;inger can dwell on, and have, thereby, an opportunity of more effec|tually di&s;playing the beauties, and call|ing forth the powers of his voice; for the beauty of &s;ound it&s;elf, and of voice in particular, as being the fine&s;t of all &s;ounds, is held, by the Italians, to be one of the chief &s;ources of the plea&s;ure we derive from mu&s;ic. The &s;ubjects proper for this Air are &s;entiments of dignity.</P>
<P><HI>Aria di mezzo caratttre.</HI>&mdash;Your Lord|&s;hip can be at no lo&s;s to under&s;tand
<PB N="38" REF="60">
this term; though I know no words in our language by which I could pro|perly tran&s;late it. It is a &s;pecies of Air, which, though expre&s;&s;ive neither of the dignity of this la&s;t, nor of the pa|thos of the former, is, however, &s;eri|ous and plea&s;ing.</P>
<P><HI>Aria parlante,</HI>&mdash;&s;peaking Air, is that which, from the nature of its &s;ubject, admits neither of long notes in the compo&s;ition, nor of many ornaments in the execution. The rapidity of the motion of this Air is proportioned to the violence of the pa&s;&s;ion which is ex|pre&s;&s;ed by it. This &s;pecies of Air goes &s;ometimes by the name of <HI>aria di nota e parola,</HI> and likewi&s;e of <HI>aria agitata</HI>;
<PB N="39" REF="61">
but the&s;e are rather &s;ub-divi&s;ions of the &s;pecies, and relate to the different de|grees of violence of the pa&s;&s;ion ex|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Aria di bravura, aria di agilita,</HI>&mdash;is that which is compo&s;ed <HI>chiefly,</HI> indeed, too often, <HI>merely</HI> to indulge the &s;inger in the di&s;play of certain powers in the execution, particularly extraordinary agility or compa&s;s of voice. Though this kind of air may be &s;ometimes in|troduced with &s;ome effect, and with|out any great violation of propriety, yet, in general, the means are here con&s;ounded with the end.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="62"><HI>Rondo</HI>&mdash;is a term of French origin, unknown, I believe, till of late to the Italian mu&s;icians. It relates merely to a certain peculiarity in the con&s;truction of the &s;ong, in which the compo&s;er, after having properly e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;ubject, carries it through a variety of tones, every now and then returning to the principal &s;train or part, and al|ways concluding with it.</P>
<P><HI>Cavatina</HI>&mdash;is an expre&s;&s;ion which likewi&s;e relates to the form alone, meaning an Air of one part, without repetition.</P>
<P>The&s;e, to the be&s;t of my remem|brance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the cla&s;&s;es into which the Italians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> divided Air.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="63">I &s;hall now &s;ay &s;omething of each cla&s;s; and, in doing &s;o, I hope to give your Lord&s;hip &s;ome idea of the great extent as well as preci&s;ion of the Ita|lian mu&s;ic, and to &s;how, that, though the names of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es be evidently taken from circum&s;tances of practice, yet the&s;e circum&s;tances, if properly at|tended to, will be found to be &s;trictly connected with, and, indeed, to ori|ginate from di&s;tinctions of a higher kind, which mu&s;t have been previou&s;|ly made with re&s;pect to the nature of the pa&s;&s;ions, and their effect on utter|ance and expre&s;&s;ion. Whether the I|talian compo&s;ers, in ob&s;erving the&s;e di&s;tinctions, have been guided by &s;ome &s;y&s;tem, or have been merely influenced

by feeling, I cannot take upon me to &s;ay.

<P>THE <HI>aria cantabile</HI> is emphatically &s;o called, as being the highe&s;t &s;pecies of Song. It is that indeed which affords the &s;inger an opportuni|ty of di&s;playing, in the execution of it, all his powers and &s;kill;&mdash;if he has voice, if he has feeling, if he has ta&s;te, if he has fancy, if he has &s;cience&mdash;here he has ample &s;cope for the exer|tion
<PB N="44" REF="66">
 of them all. The &s;ubject proper for this air is the expre&s;&s;ion of tender|ne&s;s. Though this be an expre&s;&s;ion which always tends to &s;adne&s;s, yet the &s;adne&s;s is of that plea&s;ing kind which the mind loves to indulge: Thus, the memory of plea&s;ures that are pa&s;t, the complaints of a lover ab&s;ent from his <HI>faithful</HI> mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;uch like, are proper themes for this air. Hence it ari&s;es, that the <HI>aria cantabile,</HI> whil&s;t it is &s;u&s;ceptible of great pathos, admits, without prejudice to the expre&s;&s;ion, of being highly ornamented; for this plain rea&s;on, that, though the &s;enti|ments it expre&s;&s;es are affecting, they are, at the &s;ame time, &s;uch as the mind dwells on with plea&s;ure; and it is like|wi&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="67">
for this rea&s;on that the &s;ubject of the <HI>cantabile</HI> mu&s;t never border on deep di&s;tre&s;s, nor approach to violent agita|tion, both of which are evidently in|con&s;i&s;tent with ornament. The motion of this air, though not &s;o &s;olemn as that which belongs to &s;till graver &s;ubjects, is very &s;low, and its con&s;tituent notes, of con&s;equence, proportionally long; I &s;ay <HI>con&s;tituent notes,</HI> in order to di&s;tin|gui&s;h tho&s;e which the &s;inger introduces as ornamental from tho&s;e which con|&s;titute the melody it&s;elf. The&s;e la&s;t are, in general, very few, extremely &s;imple in their march, and &s;o arranged as to allow great latitude to the &s;kill of the &s;inger. The in&s;trumental parts are, in this kind of &s;ong, re&s;tricted to
<PB N="46" REF="68">
almo&s;t nothing; for, though the accom|panyment is of u&s;e to the &s;inger be|cau&s;e it &s;upports the voice, yet ought it to be kept &s;o &s;ubordinate to the vocal part, as never, during the &s;ong, to be|come the object of attention. The &s;inger who attempts the <HI>cantabile</HI> &s;hould be endowed, in the fir&s;t place, with a fine voice, of the &s;weet and plaintive kind, that the long notes, of which this &s;ong is compo&s;ed, may, of them|&s;elves, delight the ear: He ought to have great &s;en&s;ibility, that he may nicely feel and expre&s;s in an affecting manner the &s;entiment: He &s;hould po&s;|&s;e&s;s, be&s;ides, great ta&s;te and fancy, highly to ornament the melody, and, thereby, give to it that elegance which
<PB N="47" REF="69">
is e&s;&s;ential to this kind of &s;ong: An accurate judgment is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, to keep his fancy within due bounds; and he ought to be a perfect ma&s;ter of the &s;cience of counter-point, that he may know preci&s;ely what liberties he may take with re&s;pect to the harmony of the other parts. As the productions of <HI>&s;cience</HI> are, at lea&s;t in part, ju&s;tly e&s;teemed by the degree of <HI>utility</HI> which attends them, &s;o tho&s;e of <HI>art</HI> may be by the degree of <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> they afford. Now, it is the &s;uperior degree of plea|&s;ure (which proceeds from the joint exertion of &s;o many powers of nature and art in the <HI>aria cantabile</HI>) that gives to it the pre-eminence over every other kind of &s;ong; for your Lord&s;hip will
<PB N="48" REF="70">
ob&s;erve, that, in li&s;tening to an air of this de&s;cription, though the mind is all awake to feeling, yet are the e|motions it experiences of that gentle kind which unfit it neither for the con|templation of beauty, nor for the ad|miration of art; on the contrary, they &s;erve to di&s;po&s;e it more effectually for both. Thus, many of the noble&s;t fa|culties of the mind are gratified at once; we judge, we admire, we feel, at the &s;ame in&s;tant of time; and, I may even &s;ay, we are, at the &s;ame in|&s;tant, &s;en&s;ibly fea&s;ted; for there is no doubt but there is a charm, not only in the harmony of &s;ounds, but even in the beauty of &s;ound it&s;elf, which acts phy&s;ically on the machine, and may
<PB N="49" REF="71">
be con&s;idered as actually producing a &s;en&s;ual gratification. The following are examples of the <HI>cantabile</HI> from Me|ta&s;ta&s;io: In the fir&s;t, a lover, complain|ing to his friend of the cruelty of his mi&s;tre&s;s, concludes the recitative by &s;aying, <Q><P>Ma quanto, ah, tu nol &s;ai, quant' &egrave; tiranna.</P><P> But thou knowe&s;t not, alas how unkind &s;he is.</P><LG TYPE="air">

<P>I have only now to add, on the &s;ub|ject of this air, that I &s;hould be &s;orry, from what I have &s;aid of the ornament e&s;&s;ential to it, to have given ri&s;e to an opinion in your Lord&s;hip, which the general practice of &s;ingers is, I own,
<PB N="52" REF="74">
but too apt to confirm, namely, that the <HI>cantabile</HI> is little el&s;e than a &s;tring of flouri&s;hes, originating almo&s;t entire|ly in the caprice of the performer. This is very far from being the ca&s;e: Though the melancholy expre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>cantabile</HI> be of that &s;oothing kind which the mind loves to indulge, and is, therefore, not incompatible with &s;ome exertions of the fancy, yet are the&s;e exertions clearly limited, both with re&s;pect to number and quality, by the &s;en&s;e of the words; &s;ome ad|mit of more, &s;ome of le&s;s ornament. The expre&s;&s;ion of tenderne&s;s, as has been already ob&s;erved, is that which peculiarly characteri&s;es this air; and ju&s;t in proportion as this expre&s;&s;ion is
<PB N="53" REF="75">
allied to &s;entiments of hope or plea|&s;ure, or tends rather towards &s;adne&s;s and de&s;pondency, it admits more or le&s;s of being ornamented.&mdash;As to the exact quantum, no preci&s;e rules can be given:&mdash;This, it is evident, mu&s;t always depend on the nice judgment of the performer; and it is certain, that, the greater his feeling, and the more cor|rect his ta&s;te, the more &s;paring he will be in the application of embelli&s;hments.&mdash;Tho&s;e, he makes u&s;e of, will re&s;emble in kind and number, not tho&s;e orna|ments which, without di&s;tinction, o|verload the whole &s;urface of a Gothic building, but tho&s;e with which the Greeks adorned their architecture, which in times of the pure&s;t ta&s;te,
<PB N="54" REF="76">
were never &s;o many as to di&s;gui&s;e, in any degree, the appearance of &s;impli|city, nor &s;o prominent as to di&s;turb the &s;ymmetry of the great component parts of the edifice. Having mention|ed architecture, a very &s;triking analo|gy pre&s;ents it&s;elf to me between the Corinthian order and the <HI>aria cantabile.</HI></P>
<P>As in this order it appears evi|dently to have been the intention of the inventor to unite, as far as they are con&s;i&s;tent with each other, beauty and utility; &s;o it &s;eems the object of the <HI>cantabile</HI> to unite, in the &s;ame man|ner, beauty and expre&s;&s;ion. Thus, e|legance and refinement are equally the character of both,&mdash;in both have the
<PB N="55" REF="77">
&s;ame kind of limitation;&mdash;in the for|mer, any thing, however beautiful in it&s;elf, that militated again&s;t utility, would have been inadmi&s;&s;ible;&mdash;in the latter, any ornament, however graceful in it&s;elf, that ran counter-to, or, in the lea&s;t, dimini&s;hed the expre&s;&s;ion, would be unpardonable;&mdash;for utility is the fir&s;t principle of architecture, and ex|pre&s;&s;ion is the great end of mu&s;ic. This analogy might be carried a great deal farther, but, I am afraid, I have already exhau&s;ted your Lord&s;hip's pa|tience.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;econd cla&s;s of Airs to be con|&s;idered, is the <HI>aria di portamento,</HI>&mdash;a term expre&s;&s;ive of a certain way of managing the voice. It means, that the voice mu&s;t be &s;trongly &s;upported, and artfully managed, through the long notes, of which this air is com|po&s;ed, the motion of which is graver than that of any other &s;pecies. In the
<PB N="58" REF="79">
<HI>cantabile</HI> the notes are al&s;o long; but their march is, in general, gradual and gliding: Here, on the contrary, the intervals ought to be bold, &s;triking, and unexpected. In the former, the gentle dying away,&mdash;here, the grand &s;well of the voice ought to be princi|pally attended to. In &s;hort, pathos and elegance are the characteri&s;tics of the <HI>cantabile,</HI>&mdash;grandeur and &s;ublimity of the <HI>portamento.</HI> The great object, which mu&s;icians &s;eem to have had in view in this kind of air, is to give full &s;cope to the voice to di&s;play, in the highe&s;t degree, its powers and beau|ties;&mdash;as the Italians very emphatically expre&s;s it, <Q REND="inline">"far pompa della voce."</Q> In the general definition of this air, I
<PB N="59" REF="80">
took notice to your Lord&s;hip of the high value which the Italians put on the beauty of voice it&s;elf; and, indeed, the effect of a powerful, and, at the &s;ame time, harmonious voice, in the execution of an air of this kind, is &s;uch, as, I believe, mu&s;t be felt before it can be conceived.</P>
<P>Every &s;entiment, which proceeds from greatne&s;s of mind, or that &s;peaks the admiration of what is it&s;elf &s;ublime, is a proper ground-work for this air. The &s;entiment expre&s;&s;ed by it may be accompanied with &s;en&s;ibility, but mu&s;t be calm, and undi&s;turbed by pa&s;&s;ion. This being the ca&s;e, your Lord&s;hip will &s;ee, that the &s;ubject of the <HI>porta|mento</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="81">
is of a nature too &s;erious and important to admit of that degree of ornament which is e&s;&s;ential to the <HI>can|tabile.</HI> Like the Doric order in archi|tecture, though it rejects not ornament altogether, yet it mu&s;t owe its effect chiefly to its &s;implicity and grandeur. If your Lord&s;hip will allow me, in a|nother way, to illu&s;trate the &s;pecific difference of the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es, I might &s;ay that, were Venus to &s;ing, her mode of &s;ong would be the <HI>cantabile</HI>; the <HI>portamento</HI> would be that of the Queen of gods and men.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip will be &s;en&s;ible, that, though the line between the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es be di&s;tinctly drawn, yet they
<PB N="61" REF="82">
may, more or le&s;s, partake, &s;ometimes, of the nature of each other. Some &s;entiments, for example, of a female lover, all gentlene&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility, may yet be accompanied with a degree of noblene&s;s, which, if properly felt by the compo&s;er, may induce him to give a grandeur to the mu&s;ic that will make it partake, more than u&s;ual, of the &s;tile of the <HI>portamento</HI>: As, on the other hand, circum&s;tances may be i|magined in which the mo&s;t heroic &s;en|timents, from the mixture of &s;ome tender affection, may, without lo&s;ing their dignity, be expre&s;&s;ed by &s;trains &s;omewhat more approaching to the <HI>cantabile</HI> than the general character of the air allows: But the&s;e, indeed, are
<PB N="62" REF="83">
nice &s;hades of di&s;tinction, which e&s;cape the controul of fixed rules, and can be appretiated only by corre&s;pondent feel|ings. The peculiar qualities nece&s;&s;ary for the proper performance of this air are, fir&s;t of all, a powerful and beauti|ful voice; for, without this, no &s;kill, no ta&s;te, no feeling even, can ever ren|der long notes &s;upportable, much le&s;s make them a &s;ource of delight. Se|condly, a clear and unequivocal pro|nunciation, by virtue of which, not|with&s;tanding the length of the notes, the articulations, with which they be|gan, may be &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on the memory, as to render the &s;en&s;e ea&s;ily followed and under&s;tood. La&s;tly, A graceful manner of acting, without
<PB N="63" REF="84">
which, in that kind of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"action &s;ou|tenue,"</Q> which the great length of the notes requires, the deportment of the actor mu&s;t indeed be aukward in the extreme.</P>
<P>I proceed now to give your Lord&s;hip &s;ome examples of the&s;e airs, beginning with one of the mo&s;t &s;erious kind, and, by its nature, the farthe&s;t removed from the <HI>cantabile:</HI>&mdash;It is likewi&s;e taken from Meta&s;ta&s;io:&mdash;In the Ora|torio of <HI>the pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t:</HI>

<P>THE <HI>aria di mezzo carattere</HI> comes next to be con&s;idered. The &s;ub|jects proper for this kind of air are many, and very different, its particu|lar character being neither the pathetic, the grand, nor the pa&s;&s;ionate, but the plea&s;ing. There may be an almo&s;t in|finite variety of &s;entiments, very pretty
<PB N="70" REF="90">
and very intere&s;ting, which are not, however, of &s;ufficient importance to be made the &s;ubject either of the <HI>can|tabile</HI> or the <HI>portamento</HI>:&mdash;The <HI>aria di mezzo carattere</HI> comprehends all &s;uch.&mdash;From the great variety which this air, of con&s;equence, embraces, as well as from the le&s;s emphatic nature of the &s;entiments to which it belongs, its ge|neral expre&s;&s;ion is not &s;o determined as that of the former clo&s;&s;es; yet, with re&s;pect to each individual air, the ex|pre&s;&s;ion is far from being vague or dubious, and though &s;ome greater la|titude be here granted to the fancy of the compo&s;er, nothing is given to his caprice, the &s;en&s;e it&s;elf of the words clearly a&s;certaining, in point both of
<PB N="71" REF="91">
degree and quality, the expre&s;&s;ion. The degree ought to be in exact pro|portion to the placidity or warmth of the &s;entiment, and its particular ca&s;t ought to be regulated by the nature of that pa&s;&s;ion to which the &s;entiment is naturally allied; for &s;entiments are but gentler degrees of pa&s;&s;ion. Thus, this cla&s;s of airs, whil&s;t it retains its own particular character, may, by turns, have &s;ome affinity with almo&s;t all the other cla&s;&s;es; but, whil&s;t its latitude is great in re&s;pect of variety, its limita|tions, with regard to degree, are ob|vious;&mdash;it may be &s;oothing, but not &s;ad;&mdash;it may be plea&s;ing, but not ele|vated;&mdash;it may be lively, but not gay. The motion of this air is, by the Ita|lians,
<PB N="72" REF="92">
termed <HI>andante,</HI> which is the exact medium of mu&s;ical time between its extremes of &s;low and quick. As the vocal part is never &s;uppo&s;ed here to be &s;o beautiful and intere&s;ting as in the higher cla&s;&s;es, the orche&s;tra, tho' it ought never to cover the voice, is not, however, kept in &s;uch &s;ubordina|tion to it;&mdash;it is not only allowed to play louder, but may be more fre|quently introduced by it&s;elf, and may, on the whole, contribute more to the general effect of the air.</P>
<P>This kind of &s;ong is admirably well calculated to give repo&s;e and relief to the mind, from the great degree of at|tention and (with re&s;pect to my&s;elf, at
<PB N="73" REF="93">
lea&s;t, I might &s;ay) agitation excited by the higher and more pathetic parts of the piece:&mdash;They po&s;&s;e&s;s the true character which belongs to the &s;ubordinate parts of a beautiful whole, as affording a repo&s;e, not the effect of a total want of intere&s;t, but of an intere&s;t which they call forth of a different and more placid kind, which the mind can attend to with more ea&s;e, and can enjoy without being exhau&s;ted. I could wi&s;h it were in my power to give here three or four examples of this air, the more clearly to evince to your Lord&s;hip that this air, whil&s;t it retains perfectly its own peculiar character, may &s;ometimes approach, in its expre&s;&s;ion, the <HI>canta|bile,</HI> &s;ometimes the <HI>portamento,</HI> and
<PB N="74" REF="94">
&s;ometimes the <HI>parlante,</HI>&mdash;but having but one volume of Meta&s;ta&s;io by me, I cannot make that &s;election of exam|ples which I could wi&s;h. The follow|ing is from the &s;acred compo&s;ition of the death of Abel; and, as your Lord|&s;hip will ob&s;erve, partakes of the na|ture of the <HI>cantabile.</HI>&mdash;Abel &s;peaks:

<P>FROM what has been &s;aid of the foregoing cla&s;&s;es, it is evident, that none of them are at all calculated to expre&s;s any emotion which ap|proaches to agitation. Their peculiar chara&s;teri&s;tics, dignity, tenderne&s;s, e|legance, are &s;uitable to the more tem|perate and finer feelings; their &s;ubject, in &s;hort, is &s;entiment rather than pa&s;|&s;ion.
<PB N="78" REF="97">
This la&s;t, however, affords yet a very wide field for mu&s;ical expre&s;|&s;ion; and, perhaps, it is not going too far to &s;ay, that the more violent the pa&s;&s;ion, the more apt the expre&s;&s;ion of it is to receive additional energy from the power of mu&s;ic. The kind of airs which go under the general denomi|nation of <HI>aria parlante</HI> is that who&s;e peculiar province is to expre&s;s violent emotions of all kinds. As, on the one hand, the nece&s;&s;ary connection between the &s;ubject of the <HI>portamento,</HI> the <HI>canta|bile,</HI> and the <HI>aria di mezzo carattere,</HI> with the re&s;pective length of notes, and, of con&s;equence, &s;lowne&s;s of mea|&s;ure, which has been mentioned as characteri&s;tic of each of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es,
<PB N="79" REF="98">

<P>I am well aware, it may be objected here, that the greater the force of the in&s;truments the more they will be apt to overpower the voice, and, of con&s;e|quence, to de&s;troy the principal &s;ource of expre&s;&s;ion, namely, the &s;en&s;e of con|nection between the words and the notes; and, perhaps, it may not be very ea&s;y to convince tho&s;e, who are

<P>FROM what I have &s;aid of the <HI>aria di portamento,</HI> the <HI>cantabile,</HI> the <HI>mezzo carattere,</HI> and the different &s;ub-divi&s;ions of the <HI>aria parlante,</HI> I hope I have, in &s;ome degree, made it plain to your Lord&s;hip, that there is no affection of the human brea&s;t, from the &s;lighte&s;t and mo&s;t gentle &s;tirring of &s;en|timent, to the mo&s;t frantic degrees of
<PB N="114" REF="134">
pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;ome one of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es is not aptly &s;uited to expre&s;s. If this be true, other cla&s;&s;es mu&s;t be either bad or &s;uperfluous: This, in fact, is the ca&s;e of the <HI>aria di agilit&agrave;,</HI> or <HI>aria di bravura,</HI> as it is &s;ometimes called; in treating of which, it will be almo&s;t &s;ufficient to repeat to your Lord&s;hip the de&s;cription I gave of it in the general enumeration of the different cla&s;&s;es: It is an air compo&s;ed <HI>chiefly,</HI> indeed too often <HI>merely,</HI> to indulge the &s;inger in the di&s;play of certain powers in the execution, particularly extraor|dinary agility or compa&s;s of voice. In &s;uch a compo&s;ition, the <HI>means</HI> are evidently confounded with the <HI>end</HI> of the art; dexterity, (if I may be allow|ed
<PB N="115" REF="135">
the expre&s;&s;ion), and artifice, in&s;tead of &s;erving as the in&s;truments, being made the object of the work: Such are the airs which, with us, we &s;o fre|quently ob&s;erve &s;ung to ears erect, and gaping mouths, whil&s;t the heart, in ho|ne&s;t apathy, is carrying on its mere animal function: And of this kind, in|deed, are all the attempts, in the dif|ferent arts, to &s;ub&s;titute what is diffi|cult or novel for what is beautiful and natural. Where there has ever been a genuine ta&s;te for any of the arts, this aptne&s;s to admire what is new and difficult is one of the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of the decline of that ta&s;te; &s;uch is at pre&s;ent the ca&s;e in Italy with re&s;pect to all the arts; but the admiration be|&s;towed
<PB N="116" REF="136">
in Britain on difficulty and no|velty, in preference to beauty and &s;im|plicity, is the effect, not of the decline, but of the total want of ta&s;te, and pro|ceeds from the &s;ame principles with the admiration of tumbling and rope|dancing, which the multitude may gaze on with a&s;toni&s;hment long before they are &s;u&s;ceptible of the charms of grace|ful and elegant pantomime, the&s;e feats of agility having exactly the &s;ame re|lation to fine dancing that the above mentioned airs have to expre&s;&s;ive mu|&s;ic: They are, therefore, I conceive, incompatible with the nature of a &s;eri|ous drama; but in the burletta, or comic opera, in which much greater liberties may be taken, I think I have,
<PB N="117" REF="137">
&s;ometimes, heard them introduced with &s;ucce&s;s. In a comedy, a pretty frolic|&s;ome coquette may be &s;uppo&s;ed to cut an elegant caper, at once to &s;how her legs and to di&s;play her &s;kill in dancing; nay, &s;uch a &s;troke might be characte|ri&s;tic, and therefore proper: So a gay fa&s;hionable lady might, with a kind of graceful levity, expre&s;s, by an air of this kind, &s;ome of her pretty capricious humours, equally unintelligible with the mu&s;ic it&s;elf, the merit of both con|&s;i&s;ting merely in the prettine&s;s of the <HI>manner</HI>; for this kind of mu&s;ic, tho' incapable of any expre&s;&s;ion excepting that, perhaps, of gaiety in general, may yet have all the beauty which can be given to it by a fine voice running,

with ea&s;e and velocity, though an ar|rangment of notes, not in it&s;elf un|plea&s;ing, ju&s;t as the humour of the lady, though perhaps rather unmean|ing, may be accompanied with many graces of countenance, figure, voice, and motion.</P>
<P>Now, the union of all this with the mu&s;ic, produces often, without any vi|olation of propriety, a very happy ef|fect on the &s;tage; but your Lord&s;hip will ob&s;erve with what ab&s;urd impro|priety the&s;e airs often make a part of our concerts, where all this elegant flirtation of face and figure is forbid|den, and where the&s;e fanciful and ex|uberant &s;allies are gravely pronounced

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Have now endeavoured to give your Lord&s;hip as di&s;tinct an idea as I could of the &s;imple and accompa|nied Recitative, and of all tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es of Airs which have names in Italian, and which I mentioned in the fir&s;t ge|neral enumeration I made of them. There is, however, another &s;pecies of Airs, which I have not cla&s;&s;ed with
<PB N="122" REF="141">
them, becau&s;e it has no particular de|nomination, though it appears to me well de&s;erving of that di&s;tinction: But this is ea&s;ily accounted for, when it is con&s;idered, as I took occa&s;ion to ob|&s;erve in the beginning, that the names of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es are all taken from cir|cum&s;tances of the practical part of the art. The Airs alluded to here are tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ubject is a &s;imile, and which I &s;hall venture to call Airs of Imitation: The&s;e, though e&s;&s;entially different from all tho&s;e before mentioned, yet, from &s;ome circum&s;tance of &s;imilarity in the practical part, have been referred to one or other of the above cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="142">Though, upon the whole, &s;imiles of any length be perhaps &s;eldom admi&s;&s;i|ble in dramatic poetry, being in gene|ral repugnant to the genuine expre&s;|&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ion, yet &s;ometimes they may be introduced without impropriety, more particularly in the mu&s;ical drama, which, like all the other arts, ju&s;tly claims &s;ome licen&s;e in practice, with re&s;pect to that beauty which is its chief object, or that &s;pecies of plea&s;ure which it is peculiarly calculated to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Now, the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible variety of mu&s;ical effect being exactly the per|fection of this kind of drama, and tho&s;e Airs which have for their &s;ubject a &s;i|mile, by giving &s;cope to the de&s;criptive
<PB N="124" REF="143">
powers of Mu&s;ic, being a &s;ource of great beauty and variety to the piece; a more frequent introduction of &s;imiles may, on this principle, be allowed in the opera than in dramatic works, un|accompanied by mu&s;ic. Before I pro|ceed to give your Lord&s;hip any examples of this Air, I beg leave to &s;ay &s;ome|thing on the principle of Mu&s;ical Imi|tation in general. And, fir&s;t, it is evi|dent, that, be&s;ides the relations of acute and grave, of loud and &s;oft, of conti|nuous and di&s;continuous, which are &s;imply the &s;ame in noi&s;e of all kinds, as in mu&s;ical &s;ounds, there are many circum&s;tances of re&s;emblance between the&s;e la&s;t and other &s;ounds, for &s;ome of which we have not even names. The
<PB N="125" REF="144">
found of a little flute, for example, re|&s;embles the &s;inging of birds, not from its &s;hrillne&s;s merely, but on account of a certain quality of &s;ound common to both, which every ear is &s;en&s;ible of, but which we have no words to expre&s;s. It is by this quality of &s;ound that we di|&s;tingui&s;h the voices of per&s;ons, though &s;peaking, perhaps nearly on the &s;ame pitch, and di&s;criminate different in&s;tru|ments while playing the &s;ame mu&s;ical notes; and the Italians have, therefore, very properly termed it <HI>il metallo della voce.</HI> Again, motion in bodies, though not common to motion in mu&s;ic, in all its extent, is, in &s;ome re&s;pects, the &s;ame; in others &s;imilar, or at lea&s;t a|nalogous: Slow and quick, with re|gard
<PB N="126" REF="145">
to &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, with all the po&s;&s;ible degrees between their perceptible ex|tremes, are common to both: The &s;ame may be &s;aid of regular and irre|gular; and, where the&s;e fail, analogies can be affected by different means, as &s;triking as circum&s;tances of po&s;itive famene&s;s or re&s;emblance. Gliding, as it is &s;ometimes practi&s;ed, both by the voice and by certain in&s;truments, is the &s;ame in mu&s;ic as in bodies, it being in reality the effect of that motion in &s;ome body acting on another. The notes of mu&s;ic, however, being each, by its nature, &s;tationary, cannot, &s;trictly &s;peaking, be &s;aid to glide; yet the idea of a gliding motion is ea&s;ily conveyed by a certain arrangement of notes:
<PB N="127" REF="146">
In the &s;ame manner, &s;oaring, &s;inking, and even level motion, are equally ea|&s;ily expre&s;&s;ed; and though, to be &s;ure, a note cannot be &s;aid to turn or run round like a body, yet a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of notes may be found that may give an idea of circular motion, the difference between the&s;e motions in mu&s;ic and in bodies being &s;omething like the differ|ence between the&s;e circles
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
Setting a&s;ide then the more ob&s;cure a|nalogies in mu&s;ic, which are felt, per|haps, only in con&s;equence of a certain
<PB N="128" REF="147">
organization, or a degree of imagina|tion not common to all men, it is &s;ure|ly evident, that re&s;emblances or analo|gies may be produced, by means of &s;ounds, and of their rythm and ar|rangement, to every thing in nature, which we perceive in con&s;equence of &s;ound and motion: Thus the whi&s;tling of the winds, the noi&s;e of thunder, the roaring and da&s;hing of the &s;ea, the murmurs of a &s;tream, the whi&s;pers of the breeze,&mdash;the &s;olemn waving of a lofty pine, the forked motion and mo|mentary appearance of lightning, the grand &s;well of a billow, the rapidity of a torrent, the meanders of a rivulet, or the &s;mooth gliding of a &s;ilent &s;tream, mu&s;t, even to tho&s;e who have not a
<PB N="129" REF="148">
mu&s;ical ear, appear all within the com|pa&s;s of mu&s;ical imitation; for this plain rea&s;on, that po&s;itive re&s;emblance is, in fact, the ground of this imita|tion. Nor does the analogy &s;eem much &s;trained, when we &s;ay that mu&s;ic may imitate the tread of a giant, the light and nimble foot&s;teps of a nymph, or even the motion of tho&s;e fanciful beings whom Shake&s;peare has de&s;cribed as <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"cha&s;ing, with printle&s;s feet, the eb|bing Neptune."</Q> But the imitation of which mu&s;ic is capable is not &s;tinted to &s;uch po&s;itive re&s;emblances as tho&s;e now cited; general ideas of hugene&s;s and immen&s;ity, of lightne&s;s and ele|gance, of operations that are performed with difficulty or with facility, of or|der,
<PB N="130" REF="149">
of confu&s;ion, of exertion, of re|po&s;e, of energy, of debility, of &s;imila|rity, of di&s;crepancy, of union, of incom|patibility, and many more, may be clearly conveyed by different qualities, modifications, arrangements, rythm, and combinations of mu&s;ical &s;ounds. With re&s;pect to the more di&s;tant and ob&s;cure analogies, &s;uch as that to cold, light, darkne&s;s, pain, and the like, as, to tho&s;e who are le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the effects of mu&s;ic, they may &s;eem to ori|ginate rather in the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the hearer than in any reality in the art, I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on them.</P>
<P>I hope, upon the whole, your Lord|&s;hip will agree with me that it is evi|dent
<PB N="131" REF="150">
that there are &s;ufficient grounds to go upon to ju&s;tify the attempt of i|mitative mu&s;ic as di&s;tinct from pa&s;&s;ion|ate; and that the introduction of airs of this la&s;t kind mu&s;t, in con&s;equence of the variety they give, tend to beau|tify the whole, and render it more complete. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, however, that I have often &s;een them u&s;ed too frequently in the &s;ame piece; and that the effect of them can never be com|pletely fine when they are not dictated by, and accompanied throughout, with &s;ome &s;entiment or pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;peak|er.&mdash;The following is an example in point.<Q><PB N="132" REF="151"><LG TYPE="recitative">

<P>And if the winter de&s;poils it of its leaves, it makes it &s;ink deeper in the earth its roots, and it acquires &s;trength in proportion as it lo&s;es beauty.</P></Q></P>
<P>In the foregoing example, the image of the oak it&s;elf on the high cliffs, the raging of the winds, and the dignity of the &s;entiment in the &s;peaker, all con&s;pire to produce the &s;ame effect of grandeur. But I have &s;een airs, in which the &s;ubject of the pa&s;&s;ionate part was different from that of the imitative, &s;o contrived, as to keep each mo&s;t di|&s;tinctly &s;eparate from the other, whil&s;t,
<PB N="134" REF="153">
at the &s;ame time, the union of both made one beautiful whole. Handel, in his Oratorio of Acis and Galatea, has produced a ma&s;ter-&s;troke of this kind.&mdash;Galatea, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to the birds that are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ing|ing around her, &s;ays,
<Q><L>Hu&s;h, hu&s;h, ye little warbling quire,</L>
<L>Your thrilling &s;trains</L>
<L>Awake my pains,</L>
<L>And kindle fierce de&s;ire.</L></Q></P>
<P>In this example, there is no compa|ri&s;on made; the imitative part is only &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;en&s;e, and the com|po&s;er has taken the hint in adapting the mu&s;ic to it, and has indeed done
<PB N="135" REF="154">
it with the utmo&s;t propriety as well as ingenuity. It is plain, in this air, that, if the imitation of any thing is to be at all attempted, it mu&s;t be that of the warbling quire: And it is as plain, that the pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;peaker has not even the mo&s;t di|&s;tant relation to the &s;inging of birds;&mdash;to have &s;et the voice a &s;inging, in imitation of the birds, or, whil&s;t the voice &s;ang the pa&s;&s;ionate part, to have made the birds &s;ing either in uni&s;on, or in direct harmony, with the voice, would have been each equally ab&s;urd. It would &s;eem, indeed, at fir&s;t &s;ight, almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile two things &s;o different; yet this great ge|nius, by confining each part to its pro|per
<PB N="136" REF="155">
province, has &s;o artfully managed the compo&s;ition, that, whil&s;t the vocal part mo&s;t feelingly &s;peaks the pa&s;&s;ion, a little flagellet from the orche&s;tra car|ries on, throughout, the delightful warbling of the quire, and though per|fectly different in &s;ound, melody, and rythm, from the notes &s;ung by the voice, in&s;tead of di&s;tracting the atten|tion from it, or confounding the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, &s;erves to add new beauty and grace to the effect; ju&s;t as your Lord|&s;hip may conceive a naked figure &s;o veiled with &s;ome light and tran&s;parent ve&s;tment floating to the wind, as at once completely to reveal the figure, and, by its undulating folds, add new charms both to the motion and the
<PB N="137" REF="156">
form. Nothing can put in a &s;tronger light the di&s;crimination which I before made to your Lord&s;hip, of the pa&s;&s;ion|ate and imitative powers of mu&s;ic, than the above mentioned air, or more clearly evince the propriety of a&s;&s;ign|ing the fir&s;t to the voice alone, and of confining the in&s;truments to the other only. This principle, indeed, long be|fore it was perhaps ever thought of, either by philo&s;ophers or compo&s;ers, mu&s;t have been generally felt; and even the powers of the great Handel could not compen&s;ate its violation in compo&s;ition; for, in the very &s;ame opera, a little after, when Galatea is made to convert Acis into a &s;tream, and, after the &s;ymphony has made a
<PB N="138" REF="157">
fine imitation of the winding of the &s;tream through the vale, he makes Galatea repeat it with her voice; and, though the mu&s;ic of the air be, in o|ther re&s;pects, beautiful in the extreme, yet I do not believe it was ever per|formed without appearing tedious, e|ven to tho&s;e who never dreamed of this principle; and, to tho&s;e who were acquainted with it, at once tedious and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t example I gave your Lord&s;hip of the&s;e airs of imitation, the compari&s;on is it&s;elf the &s;ubject, and the nature of the &s;entiment coinciding per|fectly with it, only &s;erves to increa&s;e, perhaps, the general pathos, without
<PB N="139" REF="158">
forming, in any degree, a &s;eparate &s;ubject.&mdash;The &s;econd contains plainly a double &s;ubject, contrived with won|derful art to go on together, to &s;et off each other, and to form one beautiful whole. There is &s;till a third kind of the&s;e airs, that holds a middle place between tho&s;e two, in which, there be|ing no expre&s;s compari&s;on, the imita|tive part, as in the la&s;t, is only &s;ug|ge&s;ted by the words, but being, as in the fir&s;t, of the &s;ame quality, as it were, with the &s;entiment, does not make the immediate &s;ubject of the mu&s;ic, but is kept &s;ubordinate to the expre&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;ion or &s;entiment. The following air is of this &s;pecies:
<Q><PB N="140" REF="159"><LG>
<L>Intendo, amico rio;</L>
<L>Quel ba&s;&s;o mormorio</L>
<L>Tu chiedi in tua favella</L>
<L>Il no&s;tro ben dov' &egrave;.</L>
</LG><P>I under&s;tand thee, gentle river; in that plaintive murmur, thou inquire&s;t with me where our love is gone.</P></Q></P>
<P>As the compari&s;ons which make the &s;ubject of the&s;e airs, or, as the objects of which they only &s;ugge&s;t the imita|tion, may be &s;ublime, elegant, gay, boi&s;terous, &amp;c. &s;o they may &s;everally have a relation to &s;ome one or other of the cla&s;&s;es before mentioned, the <HI>portamento,</HI> the <HI>cantabile,</HI> the <HI>mezzo ca|rattere,</HI> and the different divi&s;ions of the <HI>aria parlante,</HI>&mdash;and, of con&s;e|quence,
<PB N="141" REF="160">
may be referred to them; the divi&s;ion which I have made of mu&s;ic into pa&s;&s;ionate and imitative being ra|ther of a philo&s;ophical kind, whil&s;t that by which the Italians have formed the different cla&s;&s;es of their airs origi|nates, as I have &s;aid, in circum&s;tances of practice only.
