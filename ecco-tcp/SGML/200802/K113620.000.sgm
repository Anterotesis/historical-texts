<HEAD>THE LIFE OF HENRY LORD VISCOUNT BOLINGBROKE.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE are &s;ome charac|ters that &s;eem formed by nature to take delight in &s;truggling with oppo&s;ition, and who&s;e mo&s;t agreeable hours are pa&s;&s;ed in &s;torms of their own creating. The &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent &s;ketch was
<PB N="2" REF="3">
perhaps of all others the mo&s;t indefa|tigable in rai&s;ing him&s;elf enemies, to &s;hew his power in &s;ubduing them; and was not le&s;s employed in im|proving his &s;uperior talents, than in finding objects on which to exerci&s;e their activity. His life was &s;pent in a continued conflict of politics, and, as if that was too &s;hort for the com|bat, he has left his memory as a &s;ub|ject of la&s;ting contention.</P>
<P>It is indeed no ea&s;y matter to pre|&s;erve an acknowledged impartiality, in talking of a man &s;o differently re|garded on account of his political, as well as his religious principles. Tho&s;e whom his politics may plea&s;e, will be &s;ure to condemn him for his religion; and on the contrary, tho&s;e mo&s;t &s;trongly attached to his theological opinions, are the mo&s;t likely to decry
<PB N="3" REF="4">
his politics. On whatever &s;ide he is regarded, he is &s;ure to have oppo&s;ers, and this was perhaps what he mo&s;t de&s;ired, having from nature a mind better plea&s;ed with the &s;truggle than the victory.</P>
<P>HENRY ST. JOHN, Lord Vi&s;count BOLINGBROKE, was born in the year 1672, at Batter&s;ea in Surry, at a &s;eat that had been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ance&s;tors for ages before. His family was of the fir&s;t rank, equally con|&s;picuous for its antiquity, dignity, and large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. It is found to trace its original as high as ADAM DE PORT, Baron of Ba&s;ing in Hamp&s;hire, before the conque&s;t; and in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages to have produced warriors, pa|triots, and &s;tate&s;men, &s;ome of whom were con&s;picuous for their loyalty, and others for their defending the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
rights of the people. His grandfather Sir WALTER ST. JOHN, of Batter&s;ea, marrying one of the daughters of lord chief ju&s;tice ST. JOHN, who as all know was &s;trongly attached to the re|publican party, HENRY, the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent memoir, was brought up in his family, and con&s;equently imbibed the fir&s;t principles of his edu|cation among&s;t the di&s;&s;enters. At that time DANIEL BURGESS, a fanatic of a very peculiar kind, being at once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of zeal and humour, and as well known for the archne&s;s of his conceits as the furious ob&s;tinacy of his principles, was confe&s;&s;or in the pre&s;byterian way to his grandmother, and was appointed to direct our au|thor's fir&s;t &s;tudies. Nothing is &s;o apt to di&s;gu&s;t a feeling mind as mi&s;taken zeal; and perhaps the ab&s;urdity of the fir&s;t lectures he received, might
<PB N="5" REF="6">
have given him that contempt for all religions, which he might have ju&s;tly conceived again&s;t one. Indeed no ta&s;k can be more mortifying than that he was condemned to undergo: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I was obliged, &s;ays he in one place, while yet a boy, to read over the commentaries of Dr. MANTON, who&s;e pride it was to have made an hundred and nineteen &s;ermons, on the hundred and nineteenth p&s;alm."</Q> Dr. MANTON and his &s;er|mons were not likely to prevail much on one, who was, perhaps, the mo&s;t &s;harp-&s;ighted in the world at di&s;co|vering the ab&s;urdities of others, how|ever he might have been guilty of e&s;tabli&s;hing many of his own.</P>
<P>But the&s;e dreary in&s;titutions were of no very long continuance; as &s;oon as it was fit to take him out of the
<PB N="6" REF="7">
hands of the women, he was &s;ent to Eaton &s;chool, and removed thence to Chri&s;t-Church college in Oxford. His genius and under&s;tanding were &s;een and admired in both the&s;e &s;emi|naries, but his love of plea&s;ure had &s;o much the a&s;cendency, that he &s;eemed contented rather with the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own great powers, than their exertion. However his friends, and tho&s;e who knew him mo&s;t intimately, were thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the extent of his mind; and when he left the univer&s;ity, he was con&s;i|dered as one who had the faire&s;t op|portunity of making a &s;hining figure in active life.</P>
<P>Nature &s;eemed not le&s;s kind to him in her external embelli&s;hments, than in adorning his mind. With the graces of an hand&s;ome per&s;on, and a
<PB N="7" REF="8">
face in which dignity was happily blended with &s;weetne&s;s, he had a man|ner of addre&s;s that was very engag|ing. His vivacity was always awake, his apprehen&s;ion was quick, his wit refined, and his memory amazing: his &s;ubtilty in thinking and rea&s;oning were profound, and all the&s;e talents were adorned with an elocution that was irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>To the a&s;&s;emblage of &s;o many gifts from nature, it was expected that art would &s;oon give her fini&s;hing hand; and that a youth begun in excellence, would &s;oon arrive at perfection: but &s;uch is the perver&s;ene&s;s of human na|ture, that an age which &s;hould have been employed in the acqui&s;ition of knowledge, was di&s;&s;ipated in plea|&s;ure, and in&s;tead of aiming to excel in prai&s;e-worthy pur&s;uits, BOLING|BROKE
<PB N="8" REF="9">
&s;eemed more ambitious of be|ing thought the greate&s;t rake about town. This period might have been compared to that of fermentation in liquors, which grow muddy before they brighten; but it mu&s;t al&s;o be confe&s;t, that tho&s;e liquors which ne|ver ferment are &s;eldom clear. In this &s;tate of di&s;order he was not without his lucid intervals; and even while he was noted for keeping Mi&s;s GUM|LEY, the mo&s;t expen&s;ive pro&s;titute in the kingdom, and bearing the greate&s;t quantity of wine without intoxication, he even then de&s;pi&s;ed his paltry am|bition. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The love of &s;tudy, &s;ays he, and de&s;ire of knowledge, were what I felt all my life; and though my genius, unlike the daemon of SOCRATES, whi&s;pered &s;o &s;oftly, that very often I heard him not in the hurry of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions with which
<PB N="9" REF="10">
I was tran&s;ported, yet &s;ome calmer hours there were, and in them I hearkened to him."</Q> The&s;e &s;ecret admonitions were indeed very few, &s;ince his exce&s;&s;es are remembered to this very day. I have &s;poke to an old man, who a&s;&s;ured me that he &s;aw him and another of his companions run naked through the Park, in a fit of in|toxication; but then it was a time when public decency might be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed with le&s;s danger than at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>During this period, as all his at|tachments were to plea&s;ure, &s;o his &s;tudies only &s;eemed to lean that way. His fir&s;t attempts were in poetry, in which he di&s;covers more wit than ta&s;te, more labour than harmony in his ver&s;ification. We have a copy of his ver&s;es prefixed to DRYDEN's Vir|gil, complimenting the poet, and
<PB N="10" REF="11">
prai&s;ing his tran&s;lation. We have another not &s;o well known, prefixed to a French work, publi&s;hed in Hol|land, by the Chevalier de ST. HYA|CINTH, intituled, le Chef de Oeuvre d'un Inconnu. This performance is an humorous piece of critici&s;m upon a mi&s;erable old ballad, and BOLING|BROKE's compliment, though written in Engli&s;h, is printed in Greek cha|racters, &s;o that at the fir&s;t glance it may deceive the eye, and be mi&s;taken for real Greek. There are two or three things more of his compo&s;ition, which have appeared &s;ince his death, but which neither do honour to his parts or memory.</P>
<P>In this mad career of plea&s;ure he continued for &s;ome time; but at length in 1700, when he arrived at the twenty-eighth year of his age, he
<PB N="11" REF="12">
began to take a di&s;like to his method of living, and to find that &s;en&s;ual plea|&s;ure alone was not &s;ufficient to make the happine&s;s of a rea&s;onable creature. He therefore made his fir&s;t effort to break from his &s;tate of infatuation, by marrying the daughter and co|heire&s;s of Sir HENRY WINCHESCOMB, a de&s;cendant from the famous JACK of NEWBURY, who though but a clo|thier in the reign of HENRY VIII. was able to entertain the king and all his retinue in the mo&s;t &s;plendid manner. This lady was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fortune exceeding forty thou&s;and pounds, and was not deficient in men|tal accompli&s;hments; but whether he was not yet fully &s;atiated with his former plea&s;ures, or whether her tem|per was not conformable to his own, it is certain they were far from living happily together. After cohabiting
<PB N="12" REF="13">
for &s;ome time together, they parted by mutual con&s;ent, both equally di&s;|plea&s;ed; he complaining of the ob|&s;tinacy of her temper, &s;he of the &s;hamele&s;&s;ne&s;s of his infidelity. A great part of her fortune &s;ome time after upon his attainder was given her back, but as her family e&s;tates were &s;ettled upon him, he enjoyed them after her death, upon the rever|&s;al of his attainder.</P>
<P>Having taken a re&s;olution to quit the allurements of plea&s;ure for the &s;tronger attractions of ambition, &s;oon after his marriage he procured a &s;eat in the hou&s;e of commons, being elect|ed for the borough of Wotton-Ba&s;&s;et, in Wilt&s;hire, his father having &s;erved &s;everal times &s;or the &s;ame place. Be|&s;ides his natural endowments and his large fortune, he had other very con|&s;iderable
<PB N="13" REF="14">
advantages that gave him weight in the &s;enate, and &s;econded his views of preferment. His grandfather Sir WALTER ST. JOHN was &s;till alive, and that gentleman's intere&s;t was &s;o great in his own county of Wilts, that he repre&s;ented it in two parliaments in a former reign. His father al&s;o was then the repre&s;entative for the &s;ame, and the intere&s;t of his wife's family in the hou&s;e was very exten&s;ive. Thus BOLINGBROKE took his &s;eat with many accidental helps, but his chief and great re&s;ource lay in his own ex|ten&s;ive abilities.</P>
<P>At that time the whig and the tory parties were &s;trongly oppo&s;ed in the hou&s;e, and pretty nearly balanced. In the latter years of king WILLIAM, the tories, who from every motive were oppo&s;ed to the court, had been
<PB N="14" REF="15">
gaining popularity, and now began to make a public &s;tand again&s;t their competitors. ROBERT HARLEY, af|terwards earl of Oxford, a &s;taunch and confirmed tory, was in the year 1700, cho&s;en &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons, and was continued in the &s;ame upon the acce&s;&s;ion of queen ANNE, the year en&s;uing. BOLING|BROKE had all along been bred up, as was before ob&s;erved, among the di&s;&s;enters, his friends leaned to that per&s;ua&s;ion, and all his connexions were in the whig intere&s;t. However, either from principle, or from perceiv|ing the tory party to be then gaining ground, while the whigs were declin|ing, he &s;oon changed his connexions, and joined him&s;elf to HARLEY, for whom he then had the greate&s;t e&s;teem: nor did he bring him his vote alone, but his opinion; which even before
<PB N="15" REF="16">
the end of his fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion he rendered very con&s;iderable, the hou&s;e perceiv|ing even in &s;o young a &s;peaker the greate&s;t eloquence, united with the profounde&s;t di&s;cernment. The year following he was again cho&s;en anew for the &s;ame borough, and per&s;evered in his former attachments, by which he gained &s;uch an authority and influence in the hou&s;e, that it was thought pro|per to reward his merit; and on the 10th of April 1704, he was appoint|ed &s;ecretary at war, and of the ma|rines, his friend HARLEY having a little before been made &s;ecretary of &s;tate.</P>
<P>The tory party being thus e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in power, it may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed that every method would be u&s;ed to depre&s;s the whig intere&s;t, and to prevent it from ri&s;ing; yet &s;o
<PB N="16" REF="17">
much ju&s;tice was done even to merit in an enemy, that the duke of MARL|BOROUGH, who might be con&s;idered as at the head of the oppo&s;ite party, was &s;upplied with all the nece&s;&s;aries for carrying on the war in Flanders with vigour; and it is remarkable, that the greate&s;t events of his cam|paigns, &s;uch as the battles of Blen|heim and Ramillies, and &s;everal glo|rious attempts made by the duke, to &s;horten the war by &s;ome deci&s;ive ac|tion, fell out while BOLINGBROKE was &s;ecretary at war. In fact, he was a &s;incere admirer of that great general, and avowed it upon all occa&s;ions to the la&s;t moment of his life: he knew his faults, he admired his virtues, and had the boa&s;t of being in&s;tru|mental in giving lu&s;tre to tho&s;e tri|umphs, by which his own power was in a manner overthrown.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">
As the affairs of the nation were then in as fluctuating a &s;tate as at pre|&s;ent, HARLEY, after maintaining the lead for above three years, was in his turn obliged to &s;ubmit to the whigs, who once more became the prevail|ing party, and he was compelled to re&s;ign the &s;eals. The friend&s;hip be|tween him and BOLINGBROKE, &s;eems at this time to have been &s;incere and di&s;intere&s;ted; for the latter cho&s;e to follow his fortune, and the next day re&s;igned his employments in the ad|mini&s;tration, following his friend's example, and &s;etting an example at once of integrity and moderation. As an in&s;tance of this, when his co|adjutors the tories were for carrying a violent mea&s;ure in the hou&s;e of commons, in order to bring the prin|ce&s;s SOPHIA into England, BOLING|BROKE &s;o artfully oppo&s;ed it, that it
<PB N="18" REF="19">
dropt without a debate. For this his moderation was prai&s;ed, but perhaps at the expence of his &s;agacity.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time the whigs &s;eemed to have gained a complete triumph, and upon the election of a new par|liament, in the year 1708, BOLING|BROKE was not returned. The inter|val which followed of above two years, he employed in the &s;evere&s;t &s;tudy; and this reclu&s;e period he ever after u&s;ed to con&s;ider, as the mo&s;t active and &s;erviceable of his whole life. But his retirement was &s;oon interrupted, by the prevailing of his party once more; for the whig parliament being di&s;&s;olved in the year 1710, he was again cho&s;en, and HARLEY being made chancellor, and under trea&s;urer of the exchequer, the important po&s;t of &s;e|cretary of &s;tate was given to our au|thor,
<PB N="19" REF="20">
in which he di&s;covered a degree of genius and a&s;&s;iduity, that perhaps have never been known to be united in one per&s;on to the &s;ame degree.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h annals &s;carce produce a more trying juncture, or that re|quired &s;uch various abilities to regu|late. He was then placed in a &s;phere, where he was obliged to conduct the machine of &s;tate, &s;truggling with a thou&s;and various calamities: a de&s;pe|rate and enraged party, who&s;e charac|teri&s;tic it has ever been to bear none in power but them&s;elves; a war con|ducted by an able general, his pro|fe&s;&s;ed opponent, and who&s;e victories only tended to render him every day more formidable; a foreign enemy, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of endle&s;s re&s;ources, and &s;eeming to gather &s;trength from every defeat; an in&s;idious alliance, that
<PB N="20" REF="21">
wanted only to gain the advantages of victory, without contributing to the expences of the combat; a weak declining mi&s;tre&s;s, that was led by every report, and &s;eemed ready to li&s;ten to whatever was &s;aid again&s;t him; &s;till more, a gloomy, indolent, and &s;u&s;picious collegue, that envied his power, and hated him for his abi|lities: the&s;e were a part of the diffi|culties, that BOLINGBROKE had to &s;truggle with in office, and under which he was to conduct the treaty of the peace of Utrecht, which was con|&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t complicated negotiations that hi&s;tory can afford. But nothing &s;eemed too great for his abilities and indu&s;try, he &s;et him&s;elf to the undertaking with &s;pirit: he began to pave the way to the intended treaty, by making the people di&s;con|tented at the continuance of the war;
<PB N="21" REF="22">
for this purpo&s;e he employed him&s;elf in drawing up accurate computations of the numbers of our own men, and that of foreigners employed in its de|&s;tructive progre&s;s. He even wrote in the Examiners, and other periodical papers of the times, &s;hewing how much of the burden re&s;ted upon Eng|land, and how little was &s;u&s;tained by tho&s;e who fal&s;ely boa&s;ted their alli|ance. By the&s;e means, and after much debate in the hou&s;e of com|mons, the queen received a petition from parliament, &s;hewing the hard|&s;hips the allies had put upon Eng|land in carrying on this war, and con&s;equently how nece&s;&s;ary it was to apply relief to &s;o ill-judged a con|nexion. It may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed that the Dutch, again&s;t whom this petition was chiefly levelled, did all that was in their power to oppo&s;e it;
<PB N="22" REF="23">
many of the foreign courts al&s;o, with whom we had any tran&s;actions, were continually at work to defeat the mi|ni&s;ter's intentions. Memorial was de|livered after memorial; the people of England, the parliament, and all Eu|rope were made acquainted with the inju&s;tice and the dangers of &s;uch a proceeding: however BOLINGBROKE went on with &s;teadine&s;s and re&s;olu|tion, and although the attacks of his enemies at home might have been deemed &s;ufficient to employ his at|tention, yet he was obliged at the &s;ame time that he furni&s;hed materials to the pre&s;s in London, to furni&s;h in|&s;tructions to all our mini&s;ters and am|ba&s;&s;adors abroad, who would do no|thing but in pur&s;uance of his direc|tions. As an orator, in the &s;enate he exerted all his eloquence, he &s;tated all the great points that were brought be|fore
<PB N="23" REF="24">
the hou&s;e, he an&s;wered the ob|jections that were made by the leaders of the oppo&s;ition; and all this with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that even his enemies, while they oppo&s;ed his power, ac|knowledged his abilities. Indeed, &s;uch were the difficulties he had to en|counter, that we find him acknow|ledging him&s;elf &s;ome years after, that he never looked back on this great event pa&s;&s;ed as it was, without a &s;e|cret emotion of mind, when he com|pared the va&s;tne&s;s of the undertaking, and the importance of the &s;ucce&s;s, with the means employed to bring it about, and with tho&s;e which were employed to fru&s;trate his intentions.</P>
<P>While he was thus indu&s;triou&s;ly employed, he was not without the re|wards that de&s;erved to follow &s;uch abilities, joined to &s;o much a&s;&s;iduity.
<PB N="24" REF="25">
In July 1712, he was created Baron ST. JOHN, of Lidyard Tregoze, in Wilt&s;hire, and Vi&s;count BOLINGBROKE, by the la&s;t of which titles he is now generally known, and is likely to be talked of by po&s;terity: he was al&s;o the &s;ame year appointed lord lieu|tenant of the county of E&s;&s;ex. By the titles of TREGOZE and BOLING|BROKE, he united the honours of the elder and younger branch of his fa|mily; and thus tran&s;mitted into one channel, the oppo&s;ing intere&s;ts of two races, that had been di&s;tingui&s;hed one for their loyalty to king CHARLES I. the other for their attachment to the parliament that oppo&s;ed him. It was afterwards his boa&s;t, that he &s;teered clear of the extremes for which his ance&s;tors had been di&s;tingui&s;hed, having kept the &s;pirit of freedom of the one, and acknowledged the
<PB N="25" REF="26">
&s;ubordination that di&s;tingui&s;hed the other.</P>
<P>BOLINGBROKE being thus rai&s;ed very near the &s;ummit of power, began to perceive more nearly the defects of him who was placed there. He now began to find that lord OXFORD, who&s;e party he had followed, and who&s;e per|&s;on he had e&s;teemed, was by no means &s;o able or &s;o indu&s;trious as he &s;uppo&s;ed him to be. He now began from his heart to renounce the friend&s;hip which he once had for his coadjutor; he be|gan to imagine him treacherous, mean, indolent, and invidious; he even began to a&s;cribe his own pro|motion to OXFORD'S hatred, and to &s;uppo&s;e that he was &s;ent up to the hou&s;e of lords, only to render him contemptible. The&s;e &s;u&s;picions were partly true, and partly &s;ugge&s;ted by
<PB N="26" REF="27">
BOLINGBROKE's own ambition; being &s;en&s;ible of his own &s;uperior impor|tance and capacity, he could not bear to &s;ee another take the lead in public affairs, when he knew they owed their chief &s;ucce&s;s to his own management. Whatever might have been his mo|tives, whether of contempt, hatred, or ambition, it is certain an irrecon|cileable breach began between the&s;e two leaders of their party; their mu|tual hatred was &s;o great, that even their own common intere&s;t, the vigour of their negotiations, and the &s;afety of their friends, were entirely &s;acrificed to it. It was in vain that SWIFT, who was admitted into their coun&s;els, urged the un&s;ea&s;onable impropriety of their di&s;putes; that while they were thus at variance within the walls, the ene|my were making irreparable breaches without. BOLINGBROKE's antipathy
<PB N="27" REF="28">
was &s;o great, that even &s;ucce&s;s would have been hateful to him, if lord OX|FORD were to be a partner. He ab|horred him to that degree, that he could not bear to be joined with him in any ca&s;e; and even &s;ome time af|ter, when the lives of both were aimed at, he could not think of concerting mea&s;ures with him for their mutual &s;afety, preferring even death it&s;elf to the appearance of a temporary friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>Nothing could have been more weak and injudicious, than their mu|tual animo&s;ities at this juncture; and it may be a&s;&s;erted with truth, that men who were unable to &s;uppre&s;s or conceal their re&s;entments upon &s;uch a trying occa&s;ion, were unfit to take the lead in any mea&s;ures, be their indu&s;|try or their abilities ever &s;o great. In
<PB N="28" REF="29">
fact, their di&s;&s;entions were &s;oon found to involve not only them, but their party in utter ruin; their hopes had for &s;ome time been declining, the whigs were daily gaining ground, and the queen's death &s;oon after totally de&s;troyed all their &s;chemes with their power.</P>
<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of GEORGE I. to the throne, dangers began to threaten the late mini&s;try on every &s;ide; whether they had really inten|tions of bringing in the Pretender, or whether the whigs made it a pre|text for de&s;troying them, is uncer|tain; but the king very &s;oon began to &s;hew, that they were to expect nei|ther &s;avour nor mercy at his hands. Upon his landing at Greenwich, when the court came to wait upon him, and lord OXFORD among the number, he
<PB N="29" REF="30">
&s;tudiou&s;ly avoided taking any notice of him, and te&s;tified his re&s;entment by the care&s;&s;es he be&s;towed upon the members of the oppo&s;ite faction. A regency had been &s;ome time before appointed to govern the kingdom, and ADDISON was made &s;ecretary. BO|LINGBROKE &s;till maintained his place of &s;tate &s;ecretary, but &s;ubject to the contempt of the great, and the in|&s;ults of the mean. The fir&s;t &s;tep taken by them to mortify him, was to order all letters and packets di|rected to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, to be &s;ent to Mr. ADDISON; &s;o that BO|LINGBROKE was in fact removed from his office, that is, the execution of it, in two days after the queen's death. But this was not the wor&s;t, for his mortifications were continual|ly heightened, by the daily humilia|tion of waiting at the door of the
<PB N="30" REF="31">
apartment where the regency &s;at, with a bag in his hand, and being all the time, as it were, on purpo&s;e, expo&s;ed to the in&s;olence of tho&s;e who were tempted by their natural malevo|lence, or who expected to make their court to tho&s;e in power by abu&s;ing him.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;udden turn of fortune, when the &s;eals were taken from him, he went into the country, and having received a me&s;&s;age from court, to be pre&s;ent when the &s;eal was taken from the door of the &s;ecretary's office, he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, alledging, that &s;o trifling a ceremony might as well be performed by one of the under &s;e|cretaries, but at the &s;ame time re|que&s;ted the honour of ki&s;&s;ing the king's hand, to whom he te&s;tified the utmo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. This reque&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="32">
however was rejected with di&s;dain, the king had been taught to regard him as an enemy, and threw him&s;elf entirely on the whigs for &s;afety and protection.</P>
<P>The new parliament, mo&s;tly com|po&s;ed of whigs, met the 17th of March; and in the king's &s;peech from the throne, many inflaming hints were given, and many methods of violence were chalked out to the two hou&s;es. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The fir&s;t &s;teps, (&s;ays lord BOLINGBROKE, &s;peaking on this oc|ca&s;ion) in both were perfectly an|&s;werable; and to the &s;hame of the peerage be it &s;poken, I &s;aw at that time &s;everal lords concur, to con|demn in one general vote, all that they had approved in a former par|liament, by many particular re&s;o|lutions. Among &s;everal bloody
<PB N="32" REF="33">
re&s;olutions propo&s;ed and agitated at this time, the re&s;olution of im|peaching me of high trea&s;on was taken; and I took that of leaving England, not in a panic terror, improved by the artifices of the duke of MARLBOROUGH, whom I knew even at that time too well to act by his advice or informa|tion, in any ca&s;e, but on &s;uch grounds as the proceedings which &s;oon followed &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified, and &s;uch as I have never repented building upon. Tho&s;e who blamed it in the fir&s;t heat, were &s;oon af|ter obliged to change their lan|guage: For what other re&s;olution could I take? The method of pro|&s;ecution de&s;igned again&s;t me, would have put me out of a condition immediately to act for my&s;elf, or to &s;erve tho&s;e who were le&s;s ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="33" REF="34">
than me, but who were however in danger. On the other hand, how few were there on who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance I could depend, or to whom I would even in the&s;e circum&s;tances be obliged. The ferment in the nation was wrought up to a con&s;iderable height; but there was at that time no rea&s;on to expect that it could influence the proceedings in parliament, in favour of tho&s;e who &s;hould be ac|cu&s;ed: left to its own movement, it was much more proper to quicken than &s;lacken the pro&s;ecutions; and who was there to guide its motions? The tories, who had been true to one another to the la&s;t, were a hand|ful, and no great vigour could be expected from them: the whim|&s;icals, di&s;appointed of the figure which they hoped to make, began
<PB N="34" REF="35">
indeed to join their old friends. One of the principal among them, namely, the earl of ANGLESEA, was &s;o very good as to confe&s;s to me, that if the court had called the &s;ervants of the late queen to ac|count, and &s;topped there, he mu&s;t have con&s;idered him&s;elf as a judge, and acted according to his con|&s;cience, on what &s;hould have ap|peared to him: but that war had been declared to the whole tory party, and that now the &s;tate of things were altered. This di&s;cour&s;e needed no commentary, and proved to me, that I had never erred in the judgment I made of this &s;et of men. Could I then re&s;olve to be obliged to them, or to &s;uffer with OXFORD? As much as I &s;till was heated by the di&s;putes, in which I had been all my life engaged again&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="36">
the whigs, I would &s;ooner have cho&s;en to owe my &s;ecurity to their indulgence, than to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the whim&s;icals: but I thought bani&s;hment, with all her train of evils, preferable to either."</Q></P>
<P>Such was the mi&s;erable &s;ituation to which he was reduced upon this oc|ca&s;ion; of all the number of his for|mer flatterers and dependants, &s;carce one was found remaining. Every hour brought fre&s;h reports of his a|larming &s;ituation, and the dangers which threatened him and his party on all &s;ides. PRIOR, who had been em|ployed in negotiating the treaty of Utrecht, was come over to Dover, and had promi&s;ed to reveal all he knew. The duke of MARLBOROUGH planted his creatures round his lord|&s;hip, who artfully endeavoured to in|crea&s;e
<PB N="36" REF="37">
the danger; and an impeach|ment was actually preparing, in which he was accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on. It argued therefore no great degree of timidity in his lord&s;hip, to take the fir&s;t opportunity to withdraw from danger, and to &s;uffer the fir&s;t boilings of popular animo&s;ity, to quench the flame that had been rai&s;ed again&s;t him: accordingly, having made a gallant &s;hew of de&s;pi&s;ing the machi|nations again&s;t him, having appeared in a very unconcerned manner at the play-hou&s;e in Drury-Lane, and hav|ing be&s;poke another play for the night en&s;uing; having &s;ub&s;cribed to a new opera that was to be acted &s;ome time after, and talked of making an elabo|rate defence, he went off that &s;ame night in di&s;gui&s;e to Dover, as a &s;er|vant to LE VIGNE, a me&s;&s;enger be|longing to the French king; and there
<PB N="37" REF="38">
one WILLIAM MORGAN, who had been a captain in General HILL's regiment of dragoons, hired a ve&s;&s;el, and car|ried him over to Calais, where the governor attended him in his coach, and carried him to his hou&s;e with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The news of lord BOLINGBROKE's flight was &s;oon known over the whole town; and the next day, a letter from him to lord LANSDOWNE, was handed about in print, to the follow|ing effect.</P>

<P>No &s;ooner was it univer&s;ally known that he was retired to France, than
<PB N="40" REF="41">
his flight was con&s;trued into a proof of his guilt; and his enemies accord|ingly &s;et about driving on his im|peachment with redoubled alacrity. Mr. afterwards, Sir ROBERT WALPOLE, who had &s;uffered a good deal by his attachment to the whig intere&s;t dur|ing the former reign, now undertook to bring in and conduct the charge again&s;t him in the hou&s;e of commons. His impeachment con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix ar|ticles, which WALPOLE read to the hou&s;e, in &s;ub&s;tance as follows. Fir&s;t, That whereas the lord BOLINGBROKE had a&s;&s;ured the Dutch mini&s;ters, that the queen his mi&s;tre&s;s would make no peace but in concert with them, yet he had &s;ent Mr. PRIOR to France, that &s;ame year, with propo&s;als for a treaty of peace with that monarch, without the con&s;ent of the allies. Secondly, That he advi&s;ed and pro|moted
<PB N="41" REF="42">
the making a &s;eparate treaty or convention with France, which was &s;igned in September. Thirdly, That he di&s;clo&s;ed to M. MESNAGER, the French mini&s;ter at London, this con|vention, which was the preliminary in&s;tructions to her maje&s;ty's plenipo|tentiaries at Utrecht. Fourthly, That her maje&s;ty's final in&s;tructions to her plenipotentiaries, were di&s;clo&s;ed by him to the abbot GUALTIER, who was an emi&s;&s;ary of France. Fifthly, That he di&s;clo&s;ed to the French the manner how Tournay in Flanders might be gained by them. And la&s;tly, That he advi&s;ed and promoted the yielding up Spain and the We&s;t-Indies to the duke of ANJOU, then an enemy to her ma|je&s;ty. The&s;e were urged by WAL|POLE with great vehemence, and ag|gravated with all the eloquence of which he was ma&s;ter. He challenged
<PB N="42" REF="43">
any per&s;on in the hou&s;e to appear in behalf of the accu&s;ed, and a&s;&s;erted, that to vindicate, were in a manner to &s;hare his guilt. In this univer&s;al con|&s;ternation of the tory party, none was for &s;ome time &s;een to &s;tir; but at length General ROSS, who had re|ceived favours from his lord&s;hip, bold|ly &s;tood up, and &s;aid he wondered that no man more capable was found to appear in defence of the accu&s;ed. However, in attempting to proceed, he he&s;itated &s;o much that he was ob|liged to &s;it down, ob&s;erving, that he would re&s;erve what he had to &s;ay to another opportunity. It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the whigs found no great difficulty in pa&s;&s;ing the vote for his impeachment through the hou&s;e of commons. It was brought into that hou&s;e on the 10th of June 1715, it was &s;ent up to the hou&s;e of
<PB N="43" REF="44">
lords on the 6th of Augu&s;t en&s;uing, and in con&s;equence of which he was attainted by them of high trea&s;on on the 10th of September. Nothing could be more unju&s;t than &s;uch a &s;entence; but ju&s;tice had been long drowned in the &s;pirit of party.</P>
<P>BOLINGBROKE thus finding all hopes cut off at home, began to think of improving his wretched fortune upon the continent. He had left England with a very &s;mall fortune, and his at|tainder totally cut off all re&s;ources for the future. In this depre&s;&s;ed &s;itua|tion, he began to li&s;ten to &s;ome pro|po&s;als which were made him by the Pretender, who was then re&s;iding at Barr, in France, and who was de|&s;irous of admitting BOLINGBROKE into his &s;ecret councils. A propo&s;al of this nature had been made him &s;hortly
<PB N="44" REF="45">
after his arrival at Paris, and before his attainder at home; but while he had yet any hopes of &s;ucceeding in England, he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, and made the be&s;t applications his ruined fortune would permit, to prevent the extremity of his pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>He had for &s;ome time waited for an opportunity of determining him|&s;elf, even after he found it vain to think of making his peace at home. He let his Jacobite friends in England know that they had but to command him, and he was ready to venture in their &s;ervice the little all that remain|ed, as frankly as he had expo&s;ed all that was gone. At length, (&s;ays he, talking of him&s;elf) the&s;e commands came, and were executed in the fol|lowing manner. The per&s;on who was &s;ent to me, arrived in the be|ginning
<PB N="45" REF="46">
of July 1715, at the place where I had retired to in Dauphine. He &s;poke in the name of all the friends who&s;e authority could in|fluence me; and he brought me word that Scotland was not only ready to take arms, but under &s;ome &s;ort of di&s;&s;atisfaction to be withheld from be|ginning: that in England the peo|ple were exa&s;perated again&s;t the go|vernment to &s;uch a degree, that far from wanting to be encouraged, they could not be re&s;trained from in&s;ulting it on every occa&s;ion; that the whole tory party was become avowedly Ja|cobites; that many officers of the army, and the majority of the &s;ol|diers, were well affected to the cau&s;e; that the city of London was ready to ri&s;e, and that the enterprizes for &s;eiz|ing of &s;everal places, were ripe for execution; in a word, that mo&s;t of
<PB N="46" REF="47">
the principal tories were in a concert with the duke of ORMOND: for I had pre&s;&s;ed particularly to be informed whether his grace acted alone, or if not, who were his council; and that the others were &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that there remained no doubt of their joining, as &s;oon as the fir&s;t blow &s;hould be &s;truck. He added, that my friends were a little &s;urpri&s;ed, to ob&s;erve that I lay neuter in &s;uch a conjuncture. He repre&s;ented to me the danger I ran, of being prevented by people of all &s;ides from having the merit of en|gaging early in this enterprize, and how unaccountable it would be for a man, impeached and attainted under the pre&s;ent government, to take no &s;hare in bringing about a revolution &s;o near at hand, and &s;o certain. He intreated that I would defer no longer to join the Chevalier, to advi&s;e and
<PB N="47" REF="48">
a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying on his affairs, and to &s;olicit and negotiate at the court of France, where my friends imagined that I &s;hould not fail to meet a fa|vourable reception, and from whence they made no doubt of receiving a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in a &s;ituation of affairs &s;o cri|tical, &s;o unexpected, and &s;o promi&s;|ing. He concluded, by giving me a letter from the Pretender, whom he had &s;een in his way to me, in which I was pre&s;&s;ed to repair without lo&s;s of time to Comercy; and this in&s;tance was grounded on the me&s;&s;age which the bearer of the letter had brought me from England. In the progre&s;s of the conver&s;ation with the me&s;&s;en|ger, he related a number of facts, which &s;atisfied me as to the general di&s;po&s;ition of the people; but he gave me little &s;atisfaction as to the mea|&s;ures taken to improve this di&s;po&s;i|tion,
<PB N="48" REF="49">
for driving the bu&s;ine&s;s on with vigour, if it tended to a revolution, or for &s;upporting it to advantage if it &s;pun into a war. When I que&s;|tioned him concerning &s;everal per&s;ons who&s;e di&s;inclination to the govern|ment admitted no doubt, and who&s;e names, quality, and experience were very e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ucce&s;s of the un|dertaking; he owned to me that they kept a great re&s;erve, and did at mo&s;t but encourage others to act by general and dark expre&s;&s;ions. I received this account and this &s;ummons ill in my my bed; yet important as the matter was, a few minutes &s;erved to deter|mine me. The circum&s;tances want|ing to form a rea&s;onable inducement to engage, did not excu&s;e me; but the &s;mart of a bill of attainder tingled in every vein, and I looked on my party to be under oppre&s;&s;ion, and to
<PB N="49" REF="50">
call for my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Be&s;ides which, I con&s;idered fir&s;t that I &s;hould be certainly informed, when I con|ferred with the Chevalier, of many particulars unknown to this gentle|man; for I did not imagine that the Engli&s;h could be &s;o near to take up arms as he repre&s;ented them to be, on no other foundation than that which he expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this manner having for &s;ome time debated with him&s;elf, and taken his re&s;olution, he lo&s;t no time in re|pairing to the Pretender at Comer|cy, and took the &s;eals of that nomi|nal king, as he had formerly tho&s;e of his potent mi&s;tre&s;s. But this was a terrible falling off indeed; and the very fir&s;t conver&s;ation he had with this weak projector, gave him the mo&s;t unfavourable expectations of fu|ture
<PB N="50" REF="51">
&s;ucce&s;s. He talked to me, (&s;ays his lord&s;hip) like a man who expected every moment to &s;et out for England or Scotland, but who did not very well know for which; and when he en|tered into the particulars of his affairs, I found, that concerning the former, he had nothing more circum&s;tantial or po&s;itive to go upon, than what I have already related. But the duke of ORMOND had been for &s;ome time, I cannot &s;ay how long, engaged with the Chevalier: he had taken the di|rection of this whole affair, as far as it related to England, upon him&s;elf, and had received a commi&s;&s;ion for this purpo&s;e, which contained the mo&s;t ample powers that could be given. But &s;till, however, all was un&s;ettled, undetermined, and ill un|der&s;tood. The duke had a&s;ked from France a &s;mall body of forces, a &s;um
<PB N="51" REF="52">
of money, and a quantity of amuni|tion; but to the fir&s;t part of the re|que&s;t he received a flat denial, but was made to hope that &s;ome arms and &s;ome amunition might be given. This was but a very gloomy pro&s;pect; yet hope &s;welled the depre&s;&s;ed party &s;o high, that they talked of nothing le&s;s than an in&s;tant and ready revolution. It was their intere&s;t to be &s;ecret and indu&s;trious; but rendered &s;anguine by their pa&s;&s;ions, they made no doubt of &s;ubverting a government with which they were angry, and gave as great an alarm, as would have been imprudent at the eve of a general in|&s;urrection.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of things, when BOLINGBROKE arrived to take up his new office at Comercy; and although he &s;aw the deplorable &s;tate of the
<PB N="52" REF="53">
party with which he was embarked, yet he re&s;olved to give his affairs the be&s;t complexion he was able, and &s;et out for Paris, in order to procure from that court the nece&s;&s;ary &s;uccours for his new ma&s;ter's inva&s;ion of Eng|land. But his reception and nego|tiations at Paris, were &s;till more un|promi&s;ing than tho&s;e at Comercy, and nothing but ab&s;olute infatuation &s;eemed to dictate every mea&s;ure taken by the party. He there found a mul|titude of people at work, and every one doing what &s;eemed good in his own eyes; no &s;ubordination, no or|der, no concert. The Jacobites had wrought one another up to look upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the pre&s;ent de&s;igns, as infallible: every meeting-hou&s;e which the populace demoli&s;hed, as he him|&s;elf &s;ays, every little drunken riot which happened, &s;erved to confirm
<PB N="53" REF="54">
them in the&s;e &s;anguine expectations; and there was hardly one among them who would lo&s;e the air of con|tributing by his intrigues to the re|&s;toration, which he took for granted would be brought about in a few weeks. Care and hope, &s;ays our au|thor very humorou&s;ly, &s;ate on every bu&s;y Iri&s;h face; tho&s;e who could read and write, had letters to &s;hew, and tho&s;e who had not arrived to this pitch of erudition, had their &s;ecrets to whi&s;per. No &s;ex was excluded from this mini&s;try; FANNY OGLE|THORPE kept her corner in it, and OLIVE TRANT, a woman of the &s;ame mixed reputation, was the great wheel of this political machine. The ridi|culous corre&s;pondence was carried on with England by people of like im|portance, and who were bu&s;y in &s;ounding the alarm in the ears of an
<PB N="54" REF="55">
enemy, whom it was their intere&s;t to &s;urpri&s;e. By the&s;e means, as he him|&s;elf continues to inform us, the go|vernment of England was put on its guard, &s;o that before he came to Paris, what was doing had been di&s;|covered. The little armament made at Havre de Grace, which furni&s;hed the only means to the Pretender of landing on the coa&s;ts of Britain, and which had exhau&s;ted the trea&s;ury of St. Germains, was talked of publicly. The earl of STAIR, the Engli&s;h mi|ni&s;ter at that city, very &s;oon di&s;cover|ed its de&s;tination, and all the parti|culars of the intended inva&s;ion; the names of the per&s;ons from whom &s;up|plies came, and who were particularly active in the de&s;ign, were whi&s;pered about at tea-tables and coffee-hou&s;es. In &s;hort, what by the indi&s;cretion of the projectors, what by the private
<PB N="55" REF="56">
intere&s;ts and ambitious views of the French, the mo&s;t private tran&s;actions came to light; and &s;uch of the more pru|dent plotters, who &s;uppo&s;ed that they had tru&s;ted their heads to the keeping of one or two friends, were in reality at the mercy of numbers. Into &s;uch com|pany, exclaims our noble writer, was I fallen for my &s;ins. Still, however, he went on, &s;teering in the wide ocean without a compa&s;s, till the death of LEWIS XIV. and the arrival of the duke of ORMOND at Paris, rendered all his endeavours abortive: yet not|with&s;tanding the&s;e unfavourable cir|cum&s;tances, he &s;till continued to di&s;|patch &s;everal me&s;&s;ages and directions for England, to which he received very eva&s;ive and ambiguous an&s;wers. Among the number of the&s;e, he drew up a paper at Chaville, in concert with the duke of ORMOND, mar&s;hal
<PB N="56" REF="57">
BERWICK, and DE TORCY, which was &s;ent to England ju&s;t before the death of the king of France, repre&s;enting that France could not an&s;wer the de|mands of their memorial, and pray|ing directions what to do. A reply to this came to him through the French &s;ecretary of &s;tate, wherein they declared them&s;elves unable to &s;ay any thing, till they &s;aw what turn affairs would take on the death of the king, which had reached their ears. Upon another occa&s;ion, a me&s;&s;age coming from Scotland to pre&s;s the Chevalier to ha&s;ten their ri&s;ing, he di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to London to the earl of MAR, to tell him that the concurrence of England in the in&s;ur|rection, was ardently wi&s;hed and ex|pected; but in&s;tead of that noble|man's waiting for in&s;tructions, he had already gone into the highlands, and
<PB N="57" REF="58">
had there actually put him&s;elf at the head of his clans. After this, in concert with the duke of ORMOND, he di&s;patched one Mr. HAMILTON, who got all the papers by heart, for fear of a mi&s;carriage, to their friends in England, to inform them, that though the Chevalier was de&s;titute of &s;uccour, and all rea&s;onable hopes of it, yet he would land as they plea&s;ed in England or Scotland, at a minute's warning; and therefore they might ri&s;e immediately after they had &s;ent di&s;patches to him. To this me&s;&s;age Mr. HAMILTON returned very &s;oon, with an an&s;wer given by lord LANS|DOWNE, in the name of all the per&s;ons privy to the &s;ecret, that &s;ince affairs grew daily wor&s;e, and would not mend by delay, the malecontents in Eng|land had re&s;olved to declare imme|diately, and would be ready to join
<PB N="58" REF="59">
the duke of ORMOND on his landing; adding, that his per&s;on would be as &s;afe in England as in Scotland, and that in every other re&s;pect it was bet|ter he &s;hould land in England; that they had u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endea|vours, and hoped the we&s;tern coun|ties would be in a good po&s;ture to re|ceive him, and that he &s;hould land as near as po&s;&s;ible to Plymouth. With the&s;e a&s;&s;urances the duke em|barked, though he had heard before of the &s;eizure of many of his mo&s;t zealous adherents, of the di&s;per&s;ion of many more, and the con&s;ternation of all; &s;o that upon his arrival at Ply|mouth, finding nothing in readine&s;s, he returned to Britanny. In the&s;e circum&s;tances the Pretender him&s;elf &s;ent to have a ve&s;&s;el got ready for him at Dunkirk, in which he went to Scot|land, leaving lord BOLINGBROKE all

this while at Paris, to try if by any means &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance might not be procured, without which all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s were at an end. It was dur|ing his negotiation upon this mi&s;era|ble proceeding, that he was &s;ent for by Mrs. TRANT, (a woman who had &s;ome time before ingratiated her&s;elf with the regent of France, by &s;up|plying him with mi&s;tre&s;&s;es from Eng|land) to a little hou&s;e in the Bois de Boulogne, where &s;he lived with ma|damoi&s;elle CHAUSSERY, an old &s;uper|annuated waiting-woman belonging to the regent. By the&s;e he was ac|quainted with the mea&s;ures they had taken for the &s;ervice of the duke of ORMOND; although BOLINGBROKE, who was actual &s;ecretary to the nego|tiation, had never been admitted to a confidence in their &s;ecrets. He was therefore a little &s;urpri&s;ed, at finding
<PB N="60" REF="61">
&s;uch mean agents employed without his privity, and very &s;oon found them utterly unequal to the ta&s;k. He quickly therefore withdrew him&s;elf from &s;uch wretched auxiliaries, and the regent him&s;elf &s;eemed plea&s;ed at his defection.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Pretender &s;et &s;ail from Dunkirk for Scotland, and though BOLINGBROKE had all along perceived that his cau&s;e was hopele&s;s and his projects ill de&s;igned; although he had met with nothing but oppo&s;ition and di&s;appointment in his &s;ervice, yet he con&s;idered that this of all others was the time he could not be permitted to relax in the cau&s;e. He now therefore neglected no means, forgot no argument which his under|&s;tanding could &s;ugge&s;t, in applying to the court of France: but his &s;uc|ce&s;s
<PB N="61" REF="62">
was not an&s;werable to his indu&s;|try. The king of France, not able to furni&s;h the Pretender with money him&s;elf, had writ &s;ome time before his death to his grand&s;on the king of Spain, and had obtained from him a promi&s;e of forty thou&s;and crowns. A &s;mall part of this &s;um had been re|ceived by the queen's trea&s;urer at St. Germains, and had been &s;ent to Scot|land, or employed to defray the ex|pences which were daily making on the coa&s;t: at the &s;ame time BOLINGBROKE pre&s;&s;ed the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Pa|ris, and &s;olicited the mini&s;ter at the court of Spain. He took care to have a number of officers picked out of the Iri&s;h troops which &s;erve in France, gave them their routes, and &s;ent a &s;hip to receive and tran&s;port them to Scot|land. Still however the money came in &s;o &s;lowly, and in &s;uch trifling &s;ums,
<PB N="62" REF="63">
that it turned to little account; and the officers were on their way to the Pretender. At the &s;ame time he formed a de&s;ign of engaging French privateers in the expedition, that were to have carried whatever &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end to any part of Bri|tain in their fir&s;t voyage, and then to cruize under the Pretender's commi&s;|&s;ion. He had actually agreed for &s;ome, and had it in his power to have made the &s;ame bargain with others: Sweden on one &s;ide, and Scotland on the other, could have afforded them retreats; and if the war had been kept up in any part of the mountains, this armament would have been of the ut|mo&s;t advantage. But all his projects and negotiations failed, by the Pre|tender's precipitate return, who was not above &s;ix weeks in his expedition,
<PB N="63" REF="64">
and flew out of Scotland even before all had been tried in his defence.</P>
<P>The expedition being in this man|ner totally defeated, BOLINGBROKE now began to think that it was his duty as well as intere&s;t, to &s;ave the poor remains of the di&s;appointed par|ty. He never had any great opinion of the Pretender's &s;ucce&s;s before he &s;et off; but when this adventurer had taken the la&s;t &s;tep which it was in his power to make, our &s;ecretary then re&s;olved to &s;uffer neither him, nor the Scotch, to be any longer bubbles of their own credulity, and of the &s;can|dalous artifices of the French court. In a conver&s;ation he had with the mar&s;hal DE HUXELLES, he took oc|ca&s;ion to declare, that he would not be the in&s;trument of amu&s;ing the Scotch; and &s;ince he was able to do
<PB N="64" REF="65">
them no other &s;ervice, he would at lea&s;t inform them of what little de|pendence they might place upon a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from France. He added, that he would &s;end them ve&s;&s;els, which with tho&s;e already on the coa&s;t of Scotland, might &s;erve to bring off the Pretender, the earl of MAR, and as many others as po&s;&s;ible. The mar&s;hal approved his re&s;olution, and advi&s;ed him to execute it as the only thing which was left to do; but in the mean time the Pretender landed at Graveline, and gave orders to &s;top all ve&s;&s;els bound on his account to Scotland; and BOLINGBROKE &s;aw him the morning after his arrival at St. Germains, and he received him with open arms.</P>
<P>As it was the &s;ecretary's bu&s;ine&s;s, as &s;oon as BOLINGBROKE heard of his
<PB N="65" REF="66">
return, he went to acquaint the French court with it, when it was recommended to him to advi&s;e the Pretender to proceed to Bar with all po&s;&s;ible diligence; and in this mea|&s;ure BOLINGBROKE entirely concurred. But the Pretender him&s;elf was in no &s;uch ha&s;te, he had a mind to &s;tay &s;ome time at St. Germains, and in the neighbourhood of Paris, and to have a private meeting with the re|gent: he accordingly &s;ent BOLING|BROKE to &s;olicit this meeting, who exerted all his influence in the nego|tiation. He wrote and &s;poke to the mar&s;hal DE HUXELLES, who an&s;wer|ed him by word of mouth and by letters, refu&s;ing him by both, and a&s;&s;uring him that the regent &s;aid the things which were a&s;ked were pueri|lities, and &s;wore he would not &s;ee him. The &s;ecretary, no ways di&s;|plea&s;ed
<PB N="66" REF="67">
with his ill &s;ucce&s;s, returned with this an&s;wer to his ma&s;ter, who acquie&s;ced in this determination, and declared he would in&s;tantly &s;et out for Lorrain, at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring BOLINGBROKE of his firm reliance on his integrity.</P>
<P>However the Pretender, in&s;tead of taking po&s;t for Lorrain, as he had promi&s;ed, went to a little hou&s;e in the Bois de Boulogne, where his female mini&s;ters re&s;ided, and there continued for &s;everal days, &s;eeing the Spani&s;h and Swedi&s;h mini&s;ters, and even the regent him&s;elf. It might have been in the&s;e interviews that he was &s;et again&s;t his new &s;ecretary, and taught to believe that he had been remi&s;s in his duty, and fal&s;e to his tru&s;t: be this as it will, a few days after, the duke of ORMOND came to &s;ee BOLING|BROKE,
<PB N="67" REF="68">
and having fir&s;t prepared him for the &s;urpri&s;e, put into his hands a note directed to the duke, and a lit|tle &s;crip of paper directed to the &s;e|cretary; they were both in the Pre|tender's hand-writing, and dated as if written by him on his way to Lor|rain: but in this BOLINGBROKE was not to be deceived, who knew the place of his pre&s;ent re&s;idence. In one of the&s;e papers the Pretender declared that he had no further occa&s;ion for the &s;ecretary's &s;ervice, and the other was an order to him to give up the papers in his office; all which he ob|&s;erves, might have been contained in a letter-ca&s;e of a moderate &s;ize. He gave the duke the &s;eals, and &s;ome papers which he could readily come at; but for &s;ome others, in which there were &s;everal in&s;inuations under the Pretender's own hand, reflecting
<PB N="68" REF="69">
upon the duke him&s;elf, the&s;e he took care to convey by a &s;afe hand, &s;ince it would have been very improper that the duke &s;hould have &s;een them. As he thus gave up without &s;cruple all the papers which remained in his hands, becau&s;e he was determined never to make u&s;e of them, &s;o he declares he took a &s;ecret pride in never a&s;king for tho&s;e of his own which were in the Pretender's hands; con|tenting him&s;elf with making the duke under&s;tand, how little need there was to get rid of a man in this manner, who only wanted an opportunity to get rid of the Pretender and his cau&s;e. In fact, if we &s;urvey the mea&s;ures taken on the one &s;ide, and the abi|lities of the man on the other, it will not appear any way wonderful that he &s;hould be di&s;gu&s;ted with a party, who had neither principle to give a
<PB N="69" REF="70">
foundation to their hopes, union to advance them, or abilities to put them in motion.</P>
<P>BOLINGBROKE being thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the Pretender's &s;ervice, he &s;up|po&s;ed that he had got rid of the trou|ble and the ignominy of &s;o mean an employment at the &s;ame time; but he was mi&s;taken: he was no &s;ooner rejected from the office, than articles of impeachment were preferred again&s;t him, in the &s;ame manner as he had before been impeached in England, though not with &s;uch effectual injury to his per&s;on and fortune. The ar|ticles of his impeachment by the Pre|tender were branched out into &s;even heads, in which he was accu&s;ed of treachery, incapacity, and neglect. The fir&s;t was, That he was never to be found by tho&s;e who came to him
<PB N="70" REF="71">
about bu&s;ine&s;s; and if by chance or &s;tratagem they got hold of him, he affected being in an hurry, and by putting them off to another time, &s;till avoided giving them any an&s;wer. The &s;econd was, That the earl of MAR complained by &s;ix different me&s;&s;en|gers, at different times, before the Chevalier came from Dunkirk, of his being in want of arms and ammunition, and prayed a &s;peedy relief; and though the things demanded were in my lord's power, there was not &s;o much as one pound of powder in any of the &s;hips, which by his lord&s;hip's directions parted from France. Thirdly, The Pretender him&s;elf, after his arrival, &s;ent general HAMILTON to inform him, that his want of arms and ammu|nition was &s;uch, that he &s;hould be obliged to leave Scotland, unle&s;s he received &s;peedy relief: yet lord BO|LINGBROKE
<PB N="71" REF="72">
amu&s;ed Mr. HAMILTON twelve days together, and did not in|troduce him to any of the French mi|ni&s;ters, though he was referred to them for a particular account of affairs; or &s;o much as communicated his letters to the queen, or any body el&s;e. Fourthly, The count DE CASTEL BLANCO had for &s;everal months at Havre, a con&s;iderable quantity of arms and ammunition, and did daily a&s;k his lord&s;hip's orders how to di&s;po&s;e of them, but never got any in&s;truc|tions. Fifthly, The Pretender's friends at the French court, had for &s;ome time pa&s;t no very good opinion of his lord&s;hip's integrity, and a very bad one of his di&s;cretion. Sixthly, At a time when many merchants in France would have carried privately any quan|tity of arms and ammunition into Scot|land, his lord&s;hip de&s;ired a public or|der
<PB N="72" REF="73">
for the embarkation, which being a thing not to be granted, is &s;aid to have been done in order to urge a de|nial. La&s;tly, The Pretender wrote to his lord&s;hip by every occa&s;ion after his arrival in Scotland; and though there were many opportunities of writ|ing in return, yet from the time he landed there, to the day he left it, he never received any letter from his lord&s;hip. Such were the articles, by a very extraordinary rever&s;e of for|tune, preferred again&s;t lord BOLING|BROKE, in le&s;s than a year after &s;i|milar articles were drawn up again&s;t him by the oppo&s;ite party at home. It is not ea&s;y to find out what he could have done, thus to di&s;oblige all &s;ides; but he had learned by this time, to make out happine&s;s from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own de&s;igns, and to con&s;ider all the re&s;t of mankind
<PB N="73" REF="74">
as uniting in a faction to oppre&s;s virtue.</P>
<P>But though it was mortifying to be thus rejected on both &s;ides, yet he was not remi&s;s in vindicating him&s;elf from all. Again&s;t the&s;e articles of impeachment, therefore, he drew up an elaborate an&s;wer, in which he vin|dicates him&s;elf with great plau&s;ibility. He had long, as he a&s;&s;ures, wi&s;hed to leave the Pretender's &s;ervice, but was entirely at a lo&s;s how to conduct him&s;elf in &s;o difficult a re&s;ignation; but at length, &s;ays he, the Pretender and his council di&s;po&s;ed of things bet|ter for me than I could have done for my&s;elf. I had re&s;olved on his return from Scotland, to follow him till his re&s;idence &s;hould be fixed &s;omewhere; after which, having &s;erved the tories in this, which I looked upon as their
<PB N="74" REF="75">
la&s;t &s;truggle for power, and having continued to act in the Pretender's affairs, till the end of the term for which I embarked with him, I &s;hould have e&s;teemed my&s;elf to be at liberty, and &s;hould, in the civile&s;t manner I was able, have taken my leave of him. Had we parted thus, I &s;hould have remained in a very &s;trange &s;itua|tion all the re&s;t of my life; on one &s;ide, he would have thought that he had a right on any future occa&s;ion to call me out of my retreat, the tories would probably have thought the &s;ame thing, my re&s;olution was taken to re|fu&s;e them both, and I fore&s;aw that both would condemn me: on the other &s;ide, the con&s;ideration of his having kept mea&s;ures with me, joined to that of having once openly de|clared for him, would have created a point of honour by which I &s;hould
<PB N="75" REF="76">
have been tied down, not only from ever engaging again&s;t him, but al&s;o from making my peace at home. The Pretender cut this Gordian knot a&s;un|der at one blow; he broke the links of that chain which former engage|ments had fa&s;tened on me, and gave me a right to e&s;teem my&s;elf as free from all obligations of keeping mea|&s;ures with him, as I &s;hould have con|tinued if I had never engaged in his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that, one &s;o very delicate to pre&s;erve his ho|nour, would previou&s;ly have ba&s;ely betrayed his employer: a man con|&s;cious of acting &s;o infamous a part, would have undertaken no defence, but let the accu&s;ations, which could not materially affect him, blow over, and wait for the calm that was to &s;uc|ceed
<PB N="76" REF="77">
in tranquillity. He appeals to all the mini&s;ters with whom he tran&s;|acted bu&s;ine&s;s, for the integrity of his proceedings at that juncture; and had he been really guilty, when he op|po&s;ed the mini&s;try here after his re|turn, they would not have failed to brand and detect his duplicity. The truth is, that he perhaps was the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted mini&s;ter at that time in the Pretender's court; as he had &s;pent great &s;ums of his own money in his &s;ervice, and never would be obliged to him for a farthing, in which ca&s;e he believes that he was &s;ingle. His integrity is much le&s;s impeachable on this occa&s;ion than his ambition; for all the &s;teps he took may be fairly a&s;cribed to his di&s;plea&s;ure, at having the duke of ORMOND and the earl of MAR treated more confidentially than him&s;elf. It was his aim always to be
<PB N="77" REF="78">
foremo&s;t in every admini&s;tration, and he could not bear to act as a &s;ubal|tern, in &s;o paltry a court as that of the Pretender.</P>
<P>At all periods of his exile, he &s;till looked towards home with &s;ecret re|gret; and had taken every opportu|nity to apply to tho&s;e in power, ei|ther to &s;often his pro&s;ecutions, or le&s;&s;en the number of his enemies at home. In accepting his office under the Pretender, he made it a condition to be at liberty to quit the po&s;t when|ever he &s;hould think proper; and be|ing now di&s;gracefully di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, he turned his mind entirely towards mak|ing his peace in England, and em|ploying all the unfortunate experience he had acquired to undeceive his tory friends, and to promote the union and quiet of his native country. It was
<PB N="78" REF="79">
not a little favourable to his hopes, that about this time, though unknown to him, the earl of STAIR, amba&s;&s;ador to the French court, had received full power to treat with him whil&s;t he was engaged with the Pretender; but yet had never made him any propo&s;als, which might be con&s;idered as the gro&s;&s;e&s;t outrage. But when the breach with the Pretender was univer&s;ally known, the earl &s;ent one mon|&s;ieur SALUDIN, a gentleman of Geneva, to lord BOLINGBROKE, to communicate to him his maje&s;ty king GEORGE's favourable di&s;po&s;ition to grant him a pardon, and his own earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;erve him as far as he was able. This was an offer by much too advantage|ours for BOLINGBROKE in his wretched circum&s;tances to refu&s;e; he embraced it, as became him to do, with all po&s;|&s;ible &s;en&s;e of the king's goodne&s;s, and
<PB N="79" REF="80">
of the amba&s;&s;ador's friend&s;hip. They had frequent conferences &s;hortly after upon the &s;ubject. The turn which the Engli&s;h mini&s;try gave the matter, was to enter into a treaty to rever&s;e his attainder, and to &s;tipulate the conditions on which this act of grace &s;hould be granted him: but this me|thod of negotiation he would by no means &s;ubmit to; the notion of a treaty &s;hocked him, and he re&s;olved never to be re&s;tored, rather than go that way to work. Accordingly he opened him&s;elf without any re&s;erve to lord STAIR, and told him, that he looked upon him&s;elf obliged in ho|nour and con&s;cience, to undeceive his friends in England, both as to the &s;tate of foreign affairs, as to the ma|nagement of the Jacobite intere&s;t abroad, and as to the characters of the per&s;ons; in every one of which points
<PB N="80" REF="81">
he knew them to be mo&s;t gro&s;sly and mo&s;t dangerou&s;ly deluded. He ob|&s;erved, that the treatment he had re|ceived from the Pretender and his ad|herents, would ju&s;tify him to the world in doing this. That if he remained in exile all his life, that he might be a&s;&s;ured that he would never have more to do with the Jacobite cau&s;e; and that if he were re&s;tored, he would give it an effectual blow, in making that apology which the Pretender had put him under a nece&s;&s;ity of making. That in doing this, he flattered him|&s;elf that he &s;hould contribute &s;ome|thing towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the king's government, and to the union of his &s;ubjects. He added, that if the court thought him &s;incere in tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, a treaty with him was un|nece&s;&s;ary; and if they did not believe &s;o, then a treaty would be dangerous to
<PB N="81" REF="82">
him. The earl of STAIR, who has al&s;o confirmed this account of lord BOLINGBROKE's, in a letter to Mr. CRAGGS, readily came into his &s;enti|ments on this head, and &s;oon after the king approved it upon their re|pre&s;entations: he accordingly receiv|ed a promi&s;e of pardon from GEORGE I. who on the 2d of July 1716, created his father baron of BATTERSEA, in the county of Surry, and Vi&s;count ST. JOHN. This &s;eemed preparatory to his own re&s;toration; and in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting any farther ambitious &s;chemes again&s;t the government, he rather began to turn his mind to phi|lo&s;ophy; and &s;ince he could not gra|tify his ambition to its full extent, he endeavoured to learn the arts of de|&s;pi&s;ing it. The variety of di&s;tre&s;sful events that had hitherto attended all his &s;truggles, at la&s;t had thrown him
<PB N="82" REF="83">
into a &s;tate of reflection, and this pro|duced, by way of relief, a con&s;olatio philo&s;ophica, which he wrote the &s;ame year, under the title of Reflec|tions upon exile. In this piece, in which he profe&s;&s;es to imitate the manner of SENECA, he with &s;ome wit draws his own picture, and repre&s;ents him&s;elf as &s;uffering per&s;ecution, for having &s;erved his country with abilities and integrity. A &s;tate of exile thus incurred, he very ju&s;tly &s;hews to be rather honourable than di&s;tre&s;sful; and indeed, there are few men that will deny, but that the company of &s;trangers to virtue, is better than the company of enemies to it. Be&s;ides this philo&s;ophical tract, he al&s;o wrote this year &s;everal letters, in an&s;wer to the charge laid upon him by the Pre|tender and his adherents; and the fol|lowing year he drew up a vindication
<PB N="83" REF="84">
of his whole conduct with re&s;pect to the tories, in the form of a letter, to Sir WILLIAM WYNDHAM.</P>
<P>Nor was he &s;o entirely devoted to the fatigues of bu&s;ine&s;s, but that he gave plea&s;ure a &s;hare in his pur&s;uits. He had never much agreed with the lady he fir&s;t married, and after a &s;hort cohabitation, they &s;eparated and lived ever after a&s;under. She therefore re|mained in England, upon his going into exile, and by proper application to the throne, was allowed a proper maintenance to &s;upport her with be|coming dignity: however, &s;he did not long &s;urvive his fir&s;t di&s;grace, and upon his becoming a widower, he began to think of trying his fortune once more, in a &s;tate which was at fir&s;t &s;o unfavourable. For this pur|po&s;e, he ca&s;t his eyes on the widow
<PB N="84" REF="85">
of the marquis of VILLETTE, and niece to the famous madam MAIN|TENON; a young lady of great merit and under&s;tanding, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very large fortune, but encumbered with a long and trouble&s;ome law-&s;uit. In the company of this very &s;en&s;ible wo|man, he pa&s;&s;ed his time in France, &s;ometimes in the country, and &s;ome|times at the capital, till the year 1723, in which, after the breaking up of the parliament, his maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to grant him a pardon as to his per&s;onal &s;afety, but as yet neither re&s;toring him to his family inheritance, his ti|tle, or a &s;eat in parliament.</P>
<P>To obtain this favour, had been the governing principle of his poli|tics for &s;ome years before; and upon the fir&s;t notice of his good fortune, he prepared to return to his native
<PB N="85" REF="86">
country, where, however, his deare&s;t connexions were either dead, or de|clared them&s;elves &s;u&s;picious of his for|mer conduct in &s;upport of their party. It is ob&s;ervable, that bi&s;hop ATTER|BURY, who was bani&s;hed at this time, for a &s;uppo&s;ed trea&s;onable corre&s;pon|dence in favour of the tories, was &s;et on &s;hore at Calais, ju&s;t when lord BOLINGBROKE arrived there on his re|turn to England. So extraordinary a rever&s;e of fortune, could not fail of &s;trongly affecting that good prelate, who ob&s;erved with &s;ome emotion, that he perceived him&s;elf to be ex|changed: he pre&s;ently left it to his auditors to imagine, whether his coun|try were the lo&s;er or the gainer by &s;uch an exchange.</P>
<P>Lord BOLINGBROKE, upon his re|turn to his native country, began to
<PB N="86" REF="87">
make very vigorous applications for further favours from the crown; his pardon, without the means of &s;up|port, was but an empty, or perhaps, it might be called a di&s;tre&s;sful act of kindne&s;s, as it brought him back a|mong his former friends, in a &s;tate of inferiority his pride could not endure. However, his applications were &s;oon after &s;ucce&s;sful, for in about two years after his return, he obtained an act of parliament to re&s;tore him to his fa|mily inheritance, which amounted to near three thou&s;and pounds a year. He was al&s;o enabled by the &s;ame, to po&s;&s;e&s;s any purcha&s;e he &s;hould make of any other e&s;tate in the kingdom; and he accordingly pitched upon a &s;eat of lord TANKERVILLE's, at Daw|ley, near Uxbridge in Middle&s;ex, where he &s;ettled with his lady, and laid him&s;elf out to enjoy the rural
<PB N="87" REF="88">
plea&s;ures in perfection, &s;ince the more glorious ones of ambition were denied him. With this re&s;olution he began to improve his new purcha&s;e in a very peculiar &s;tyle, giving it all the air of a country farm, and adorning even his hall with all the implements of hu&s;bandry. We have a &s;ketch of his way of living in this retreat, in a let|ter of POPE's to SWIFT, who omits no opportunity of repre&s;enting his lord&s;hip in the mo&s;t amiable points of view. This letter is dated from Daw|ley, the country farm above-men|tioned, and begins thus. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I now hold the pen for my lord BOLING|BROKE, who is reading your letter between two hay-cocks; but his attention is &s;omewhat diverted, by ca&s;ting his eyes on the clouds, not in admiration of what you &s;ay, but for fear of a &s;hower. He is plea&s;ed
<PB N="88" REF="89">
with your placing him in the tri|umvirate, between your&s;elf and me; though he &s;ays he doubts he &s;hall fare like LEPIDUS, while one of us runs away with all the power, like AUGUSTUS, and another with all the plea&s;ure, like ANTONY. It is upon a fore&s;ight of this, that he has fitted up his farm, and you will agree that this &s;cheme of retreat is not founded upon weak appear|ances. Upon his return from Bath, he finds all peccant humours are purged out of him; and his great temperance and oeconomy are &s;o &s;ignal, that the fir&s;t is fit for my con&s;titution, and the latter would enable you to lay up &s;o much mo|ney as to buy a bi&s;hopric in Eng|land. As to the return of his health and vigour, were you here, you might enquire of his hay|makers;

but as to his temperance, I can an&s;wer that for one whole day, we have had nothing for din|ner but mutton broth, beans and bacon, and a barn-door fowl. Now his lord&s;hip is run after his cart, I have a moment left to my&s;elf to tell you, that I overheard him ye&s;terday agree with a painter for two hun|dred pounds, to paint his country|hall with rakes, &s;pades, prongs, &amp;c. and other ornaments, merely to countenance his calling this place a FARM."</Q> What POPE here &s;ays of his engagements with a painter, was &s;hortly after executed; the hall was painted accordingly in black crayons only, &s;o that at fir&s;t view it brought to mind the figures often &s;een &s;cratched with char|coal, or the &s;moak of a candle, upon the kitchen walls of farm-hou&s;es. The whole however produced a mo&s;t &s;trik|ing
<PB N="90" REF="91">
effect, and over the door at the entrance into it, was this motto: SA|TIS BEATUS RURIS HONORIBUS. His lord&s;hip &s;eemed to be extremely hap|py in this pur&s;uit of moral tranquillity, and in the exultation of his heart, could not fail of communicating his &s;atisfactions to his friend SWIFT. I am in my own farm, &s;ays he, and here I &s;hoot &s;trong and tenacious roots; I have caught hold of the earth, to u&s;e a gardener's phra&s;e, and nei|ther my enemies nor my friends will find it an ea&s;y matter to tran&s;plant me again.</P>
<P>There is not, perhaps, a &s;tronger in&s;tance in the world than his lord|&s;hip, that an ambitious mind can ne|ver be fairly &s;ubdued, but will &s;till &s;eek for tho&s;e gratifications which re|tirement can never &s;upply. All this

time he was mi&s;taken in his pa&s;&s;ion for &s;olitude, and &s;uppo&s;ed that to be the child of philo&s;ophy, which was only the effects of &s;pleen: it was in vain that he attempted to take root in the &s;hade of ob&s;curity, he was originally bred in the glare of public occupa|tion, and he &s;ecretly once more wi&s;hed for tran&s;plantation. He was only a titular lord, he had not been tho|roughly re&s;tored; and, as he was ex|cluded from a &s;eat in the hou&s;e of peers, he burned with impatience to play a part in that con&s;picuous thea|tre. Impelled by this de&s;ire, he could no longer be re&s;trained in ob&s;curity, but once more entered into the bu&s;tle of public bu&s;ine&s;s, and di&s;avowing all obligations to the mini&s;ter, he em|barked in the oppo&s;ition again&s;t him, in which he had &s;everal powerful co|adjutors: but previou&s;ly he had taken
<PB N="92" REF="93">
care to prefer a petition to the hou&s;e of commons, de&s;iring to be rein&s;tated in his former emoluments and capaci|ties. This petition at fir&s;t occa&s;ioned very warm debates; WALPOLE, who pretended to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, al|ledged that it was very right to ad|mit him to his inheritance; and when lord WILLIAM PAWLETT moved for a clau&s;e to di&s;qualify him from &s;itting in either hou&s;e, WALPOLE rejected the motion, &s;ecretly &s;atisfied with a re&s;o|lution which had been &s;ettled in the cabinet, that he &s;hould never more be admitted into any &s;hare of power. To this artful method of evading his preten&s;ions, BOLINGBROKE was no &s;tranger; and he was now re&s;olved to &s;hake that power, which thus endea|voured to ob&s;truct the increa&s;e of his own: taking therefore his part in the oppo&s;ition with PULTNEY, while the
<PB N="93" REF="94">
latter engaged to manage the hou&s;e of commons, BOLINGBROKE under|took to enlighten the people: accord|ingly he &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by a multitude of pieces, written du|ring the latter part of GEORGE the fir&s;t's reign, and likewi&s;e the begin|ning of that which &s;ucceeded. The&s;e were conceived with great vigour and boldne&s;s; and now, once more en|gaged in the &s;ervice of his country, though di&s;armed, gagged, and almo&s;t bound, as he declared him&s;elf to be, yet he re&s;olved not to abandon his cau&s;e, as long as he could depend on the firmne&s;s and integrity of tho&s;e co|adjutors, who did not labour under the &s;ame di&s;advantages with him&s;elf. His letters in a paper called the Craft&s;|man, were particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed in this political conte&s;t; and though &s;everal of the mo&s;t expert politicians
<PB N="94" REF="95">
of the times joined in this paper, his e&s;&s;ays were peculiarly reli&s;hed by the public. However, it is the fate of things written to an occa&s;ion, &s;eldom to &s;urvive that occa&s;ion: the Craft&s;|man, though written with great &s;pirit and &s;harpne&s;s, is now almo&s;t forgotten, although when it was publi&s;hed as a weekly paper, it &s;old much more ra|pidly than even the Spectator. Be|&s;ide this work, he publi&s;hed &s;everal other &s;eparate pamphlets, which were afterwards reprinted in the &s;econd edition of his works, and which were very popular in their day.</P>
<P>This political warfare continued for ten years, during which time he laboured with great &s;trength and per|&s;everance, and drew up &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of politics, as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed to be the mo&s;t complete now exi&s;ting.
<PB N="95" REF="96">
But as upon all other occa&s;ions, he had the mortification once more to &s;ee tho&s;e friends de&s;ert him, upon who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he mo&s;t firmly re|lied, and all that web of fine &s;pun &s;peculation actually de&s;troyed at once by the ignorance of &s;ome, and the perfidy of others. He then declared that he was perfectly cured of his pa|triotic phrenzy; he fell out not only with PULTNEY for his &s;elfi&s;h views, but with his old friends the tories, for abandoning their cau&s;e as de&s;pe|rate, averring, that the faint and un|&s;teady exerci&s;e of parts on one &s;ide, was a crime but one degree inferior to the iniquitous mi&s;application of them on the other. But he could not take leave of a controver&s;y in which he had been &s;o many years en|gaged, without giving a parting blow, in which he &s;eemed to &s;ummon up
<PB N="96" REF="97">
all his vigour at once, and where, as the poet &s;ays,
<Q>Animam in vulnere po&s;uit.</Q>
This inimitable piece is intituled, A Di&s;&s;ertation on Parties, and of all his ma&s;terly pieces, it is in general e&s;|teemed the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed this, which was received with the utmo&s;t avidity, he re&s;olved to take leave not only of his enemies and friends, but even of his country; and in this re&s;olution, in the year 1736, he once more retired to France, where he looked back to his native country with a mixture of anger and pity, and upon his for|mer profe&s;&s;ing friends, with a &s;hare of contempt and indignation. I expect little, &s;ays he, from the principal actors that tread the &s;tage at pre&s;ent.
<PB N="97" REF="98">
They are divided not &s;o much as it &s;eemed, and as they would have it believed, about mea&s;ures. The true divi&s;ion is about their different ends. Whil&s;t the mini&s;ter was not hard pu&s;hed, nor the pro&s;pect of &s;ucceed|ing to him near, they appeared to have but one end, the reformation of the government. The de&s;truction of the mini&s;ter was pur&s;ued only as a preliminary, but of e&s;&s;ential and in|di&s;putable nece&s;&s;ity, to that end: but when his de&s;truction &s;eemed to ap|proach, the object of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion interpo&s;ed to the &s;ight of many, and the reformation of the government was no longer their point of view. They had divided the &s;kin, at lea&s;t in their thoughts, before they had taken the bea&s;t. The common fear of ha&s;|tening his downfal for others, made them all faint in the chace. It was this,
<PB N="98" REF="99">
and this alone, that &s;aved him, and put off his evil day.</P>
<P>Such were his cooler reflections, after he had laid down his political pen, to employ it in a manner that was much more agreeable to his u&s;ual profe&s;&s;ions, and his approaching age. He had long employed the few hours he could &s;pare, on &s;ubjects of a more general and important nature to the intere&s;ts of mankind; but as he was frequently interrupted by the alarms of party, he made no great profici|ency in his de&s;ign. Still, however, he kept it in view, and he makes fre|quent mention in his letters to SWIFT, of his intentions to give metaphy&s;ics a new and u&s;eful turn. I know, &s;ays he in, one of the&s;e, how little regard you pay to writings of this kind; but I imagine, that if you can like any, it mu&s;t be tho&s;e that &s;trip metaphy|&s;ics
<PB N="99" REF="100">
of all their bomba&s;t, keep within the &s;ight of every well con&s;tituted eye, and never bewilder them&s;elves, whil&s;t they pretend to guide the rea|&s;on of others.</P>
<P>Having now arrived at the &s;ixtieth year of his age, and being ble&s;&s;ed with a very competent &s;hare of for|tune, he retired into France, far from the noi&s;e and hurry of party; for his &s;eat at Dawley was too near, to de|vote the re&s;t of his life to retirement and &s;tudy. Upon his going to that country, as it was generally known that di&s;dain, vexation, and di&s;|appointment had driven him there, many of his friends, as well as his enemies &s;uppo&s;ed, that he was once again gone over to the Pretender. Among the number who entertained this &s;u&s;picion, was SWIFT, whom POPE,
<PB N="100" REF="101">
in one of his letters, very roundly chides for harbouring &s;uch an unju&s;t opinion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You &s;hould be cautious, &s;ays he, of cen&s;uring any motion or action of lord BOLINGBROKE, becau&s;e you hear it only from &s;hal|low, envious, and malicious re|porters. What you writ to me about him, I find, to my great &s;candal, repeated in one of yours to another. Whatever you might hint to me, was this for the pro|fane? The thing, if true, &s;hould be concealed; but it is, I a&s;&s;ure you, ab&s;olutely untrue in every circum&s;tance. He has fixed in a very agreeable retirement, near Fontainbleau, and makes it his whole bu&s;ine&s;s VACARE LITTERIS."</Q></P>
<P>This reproof from POPE was not more friendly than it was true; lord
<PB N="101" REF="102">
BOLINGBROKE was too well acquaint|ed with the forelorn &s;tate of that par|ty, and the folly of its conductors, once more to embark in their de&s;pe|rate concerns. He now &s;aw, that he had gone as far towards rein&s;tating him&s;elf in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his former honours, as the mere dint of parts and application could go, and was at length experimentally con|vinced, that the decree was ab&s;olutely irrever&s;ible, and the door of the hou&s;e of lords finally &s;hut again&s;t him. He therefore, at POPE's &s;ugge&s;tion, re|tired merely to be at lei&s;ure from the broils of oppo&s;ition, for the calmer plea&s;ures of philo&s;ophy. Thus the de|cline of his life, though le&s;s brilliant, became more amiable; and even his happine&s;s was improved by age, which had rendered his pa&s;&s;ions more mode|rate, and his wi&s;hes more attainable.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="103">
But he was far from &s;uffering, even in &s;olitude, his hours to glide away in torpid inactivity. That active re&s;t|le&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, &s;till continued to ac|tuate his pur&s;uits; and having lo&s;t the &s;ea&s;on for gaining power over his co|temporaries, he was now re&s;olved upon acquiring fame from po&s;terity. He had not been long in his retreat near Fontainbleau, when he began a cour&s;e of letters on the &s;tudy and u&s;e of hi&s;|tory, for the u&s;e of a young noble|man. In the&s;e he does not follow the methods of St. REAL, and others who have treated on this &s;ubject, who make hi&s;tory the great fountain of all knowledge; he very wi&s;ely con|fines its benefits, and &s;uppo&s;es them to con&s;i&s;t in deducing general maxims from particular facts, than in illu&s;trat|ing maxims by the application of hi&s;to|rical pa&s;&s;ages. In mentioning eccle&s;ia&s;|tical
<PB N="103" REF="104">
hi&s;tory, he gives his opinion very freely, upon the &s;ubject of the divine original of the &s;acred books, which he &s;uppo&s;es to have no &s;uch foundation. This new &s;y&s;tem of thinking, which he had always propagated in conver|&s;ation, and which he now began to adopt in his more laboured compo&s;i|tions, &s;eemed no way &s;upported either by his acutene&s;s or his learning. He began to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on the&s;e &s;ub|jects too late in life, and to &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e objections very new and unan|&s;werable, which had been already confuted by thou&s;ands. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lord BO|LINGBROKE, &s;ays POPE, in one of his letters, is above trifling; when he writes of any thing in this world, he is more than mortal. If ever he trifles, it mu&s;t be when he turns divine."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="105">
In the mean time, as it was evi|dent, that a man of his active ambi|tion, in chu&s;ing retirement when no longer able to lead in public, mu&s;t be liable to ridicule in re&s;uming a re|&s;igned philo&s;ophical air: in order to obviate the cen&s;ure, he addre&s;&s;ed a letter to lord BATHURST, upon the true u&s;e of retirement and &s;tudy; in which he &s;hows him&s;elf &s;till able and willing to undertake the cau&s;e of his country, whenever its di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;hould require his exertion. I have, &s;ays he, renounced neither my country, nor my friends; and by friends I mean all tho&s;e, and tho&s;e alone, who are &s;uch to their country. In their pro&s;perity, they &s;hall never hear of me; in their di&s;tre&s;s, always. In that retreat where|in the remainder of my days &s;hall be &s;pent, I may be of &s;ome u&s;e to them, &s;ince even from thence I may advi&s;e,
<PB N="105" REF="106">
exhort, and warn them. Bent upon this pur&s;uit only, and having now exchanged the gay &s;tate&s;man for the grave philo&s;opher, he &s;hone forth with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre. His conver&s;a|tion took a different turn from what had been u&s;ual with him; and, as we are a&s;&s;ured by lord ORRERY, who knew him, it united the wi&s;dom of SOCRA|TES, the dignity and ea&s;e of PLINY, and the wit of HORACE.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till amid&s;t his re&s;olutions to turn him&s;elf from politics, and to give him&s;elf up entirely to the calls of phi|lo&s;ophy, he could not re&s;i&s;t embark|ing once more in the debates of his country; and coming back from France, &s;ettled at Batter&s;ea, an old &s;eat which was his father's, and had been long in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fa|mily. He &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;aw an im|pending

calamity, and though it was not in his power to remove, he thought it his duty to retard its fall. To redeem or &s;ave the nation from perdition, he thought impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ince national corruptions were to be purged by national calamities; but he was re|&s;olved to lend his feeble a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to &s;tem the torrent that was pouring in. With this &s;pirit he wrote that excellent piece, which is intituled, The Idea of a Patriot King; in which he de&s;cribes a monarch uninfluenced by party, leaning to the &s;ugge&s;tions neither of whigs nor tories, but equally the friend and the father of all. Some time af|ter, in the year 1749, after the con|clu&s;ion of the peace, two years before the mea&s;ures taken by the admini&s;tra|tion, &s;eemed not to have been repug|nant to his notions of political pru|dence for that juncture; in that year
<PB N="107" REF="108">
he wrote his la&s;t production, contain|ing reflections on the then &s;tate of the nation, principally with regard to her taxes and debts, and on the cau&s;es and con&s;equences of them. This under|taking was left unfini&s;hed, for death &s;natched the pen from the hand of the writer.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the latter part of his life in dignity and &s;plendor, his ra|tional faculties improved by reflection, and his ambition kept under by di&s;|appointment, his whole aim &s;eemed to have been to leave the &s;tage of life, on which he had acted &s;uch various parts, with applau&s;e. He had long wi&s;hed to fetch his la&s;t breath at Bat|ter&s;ea, the place where he was born; and fortune, that had through life &s;eemed to traver&s;e all his aims, at la&s;t indulged him in this. He had long
<PB N="108" REF="109">
been troubled with a cancer in his cheek, by which excruciating di&s;ea&s;e, he died on the verge of four&s;core years of age. He was con&s;onant with him|&s;elf to the la&s;t, and tho&s;e principles which he had all along avowed, he confirmed with his dying breath, hav|ing given orders that none of the cler|gy &s;hould be permitted to trouble him in his late&s;t moments.</P>

<P>In this manner lived and died lord BOLINGBROKE; ever active, never de|pre&s;&s;ed, ever pur&s;uing fortune, and as con&s;tantly di&s;appointed by her. In whatever light we view his character, we &s;hall find him an object rather pro|perer
<PB N="110" REF="111">
for our wonder, than our imi|tation; more to be feared than e&s;|teemed, and gaining our admiration without our love. His ambition ever aimed at the &s;ummit of power, and nothing &s;eemed capable of &s;atisfying his immoderate de&s;ires, but the liber|ty of governing all things without a rival. With as much ambition, as great abilities, and more acquired knowledge than CAESAR, he wanted only his courage to be as &s;ucce&s;sful; but the &s;chemes his head dictated, his heart often refu&s;ed to execute; and he lo&s;t the ability to perform, ju&s;t when the great occa&s;ion called for all his efforts to engage.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ambition that prompted him to be a politician, actuated him as a philo&s;opher. His aims were equally great and exten&s;ive in both
<PB N="111" REF="112">
capacities: unwilling to &s;ubmit to any power in the one, or any autho|rity in the other, he entered the fields of &s;cience, with a thorough contempt of all that had been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed before him, and &s;eemed will|ing to think every thing wrong, that he might &s;hew his faculty in the re|formation. It might have been bet|ter for his quiet, as a man, if he had been content to act a &s;ubordinate character in the &s;tate; and it had certainly been better for his memory as a writer, if he had aimed at doing le&s;s than he attempted. Wi&s;dom, in morals, like every other art or &s;cience, is an accumulation that numbers have contributed to increa&s;e; and it is not for one &s;ingle man to pretend, that he can add more to the heap, than the thou&s;ands that have gone before him. Such innovators more fre|quently
<PB N="112" REF="115">
retard, than promote know|ledge; their maxims are more agree|able to the reader, by having the glo&s;s of novelty to recommend them, than tho&s;e which are trite, only be|cau&s;e they are true. Such men are therefore followed at fir&s;t with avidity, nor is it till &s;ome time that their di&s;|ciples begin to find their error. They often, though too late, perceive, that they have been following a &s;pecula|tive enquiry, while they have been leaving a practical good; and while they have been practi&s;ing the arts of doubting, they have been lo&s;ing all firmne&s;s of principle, which might tend to e&s;tabli&s;h the rectitude of their private conduct. As a morali&s;t, therefore, lord BOLINGBROKE, by hav|ing endeavoured at too much, &s;eems to have done nothing: but as a po|litical writer, few can equal, and
<PB N="113" REF="114">
none can exceed him. As he was a practical politician, his writings are le&s;s filled with tho&s;e &s;peculative illu|&s;ions, which are the re&s;ult of &s;oli|tude and &s;eclu&s;ion. He wrote them with a certainty of their being op|po&s;ed, &s;ifted, examined, and reviled; he therefore took care to build them up of &s;uch materials, as could not be ea&s;ily overthrown: they prevailed at the times in which they were writ|ten, they &s;till continue to the admira|tion of the pre&s;ent age, and will probably la&s;t for ever.</P>
