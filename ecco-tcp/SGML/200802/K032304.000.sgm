<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Do me the Honour to afford your Protection to the&s;e two <HI>Petites</HI> Pieces; I am &s;ure none ever &s;tood in more need of &s;o gene|rous a Friend and a Defender

as you are; tho' I dare not &s;ay they de&s;erve this Benefit by any real Merit of their own, yet they have one Title to the Protecti|on of all well natur'd People, which is, that they have Ene|mies unde&s;erv'd, and were per|&s;ecuted by tho&s;e that did not know 'em.</P>
<P>If they had gone thro' a le|gal Cour&s;e of Theatrical Ju&s;tice, tho' it might have been partial, yet I &s;hould have &s;ubmitted to it, as others had done before me; but to be prejudg'd and condemn'd unheard, was har|der Mea&s;ure than any body el&s;e meets with at this time a Day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Election,</HI> which had the
<PB REF="4">
Honour to pa&s;s your Approba|tion, was objected again&s;t as a Party - Matter: I fancy both Sides will agree that there are unrea&s;onable Heats and Extra|vagancies belonging to each of 'em, which de&s;erve to be ex|pos'd, laugh'd at, and exploded by all true Lovers of their Country, &s;ince by &s;uch Arts, our Enemies find the way to poi&s;on our Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>For the other, it was &s;aid there would be Offence taken at the expo&s;ing a <HI>Popi&s;h Prie&s;t.</HI> Good God! To what &s;ort of People are we chang'd! Are tho&s;e worthy Gentlemen (the Emi&s;&s;aries of our mo&s;t avow'd and irreconcileable Enemy) to

But let that pa&s;s, &s;ince they have their Friends and Adve|cates even here, I hope I have &s;ome too; it is not an unpar|donable Sin with every Body to wi&s;h well to the Liberties and Religion of one's Coun|try: No, Sir, I a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf, you have Goodne&s;s enough to overlook a great many o|ther Faults, where you find an hone&s;t and di&s;intere&s;ted Zeal for our pre&s;ent happy Con&s;ti|tution.

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I writ this little <HI>Farce,</HI> I was not without Hopes of having it repre|&s;ented on the Stage; what I propos'd to my &s;elf, was, the Honour to &s;how their Royal Highne&s;&s;es the Manner of our Elections, and enter|tain the Town with a Subject entirely new: It has had the good Fortune to plea&s;e &s;everal Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction, and Ta&s;te, in the Reading, and &s;ome of our be&s;t Judges a&s;&s;ur'd me, it cou'd not fail to entertain from the Stage; but the Subject being upon Elections, the Ma&s;ter of the Revels did not care to meddle with it, and the Players act nothing without his Licence, &s;o that I
<PB REF="11" MS="y">
had given over all Thoughts of its ap|pearing in Publick. But the Word <HI>Election,</HI> it &s;eems, immediately fur|ni&s;h'd out a Thou&s;and &s;candalous Sto|ries, and I was become the Subject of every Coffee-Hou&s;e in Town; and not|with&s;tanding my Friends endeavour'd to do me Ju&s;tice as often as they heard me a&s;pers'd, yet for my clearer Ju&s;ti|fication, they were of Opinion I ought to print it, &s;ince &s;everal Per&s;ons had been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly malicious as to re|port that this <HI>Farce</HI> was a mo&s;t impu|dent notorious Libel upon her Late Maje&s;ty; than which there is nothing more fal&s;e, and the World will &s;ee how little Ground there is for &s;uch a Re|port; its &s;o far from being a Satyr upon her, that there is not one per&s;onal Re|flection de&s;ign'd thro' the whole Piece; I was oblig'd indeed to make an Oppo|&s;ition of Parties, to heighten the Hu|mour; it had been impo&s;&s;ible to have writ any Thing upon the Subject with|out it; but I dare be po&s;itive, that the
<PB REF="12">
Per&s;ons among whom the Scenes lie wou'd have given more Diver&s;ion than Offence to the Spectators of either Party. I endeavour'd to make every Thing appear as natural as I cou'd, and for that Rea&s;on only, I &s;tuck Wool in the Hats of my <HI>Whigs,</HI> and Law|rel in tho&s;e of the <HI>Tories;</HI> tho' I wou'd be glad to know why the latter made u&s;e of the Lawrel to di&s;lingui&s;h them|&s;elves, when they were labouring to give up all the Conque&s;ts we had won: I &s;hould have thought a Sprig of Ro&s;e|mary had been the properer Emblem of the then approaching Funeral of our Church and State, &s;ince the <HI>Cheva|lier's</HI> Friends were endeavouring to bury our Religion, and Liberty, under Tyranny and Popi&s;h Super&s;tition. Had Parliaments been Part of the Legi&s;la|ture among the Ancients, and our Manner of Elections known to, and practis'd by them, <HI>Apollo</HI> wou'd cer|tainly have &s;hown Vengance on the un|worthy Wearers of his favourite Tree:
<PB REF="13" MS="y">
The Lawrel was ever held the Em|blem of Joy, and Reward of Vertue: Hence it was worn by Victors in the <HI>Olympick Games;</HI> but have <HI>Engli&s;h|men</HI> Rea&s;on to rejoyce in tho&s;e Mea|&s;ures, that pav'd the Way for a <HI>French</HI> Government, and a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> King?</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers, who follow|ed their Triumphs, were crown'd with Lawrel, to denote an Expiation of the Blood which they had &s;hed in the Wars; but our Lawrel-wearers can draw no Parellel from thence, except de&s;erting our Allies, &s;elling our Trade, di&s;gracing our Generals, giving up tho&s;e glorious Conque&s;ts they had won, de&s;erv'd to be crown'd with Lawrel, or that they wou'd be thought to wear it as an Expiation of the Blood of the <HI>Catalans,</HI> and of the Twelve Thou&s;and cut to Pieces at <HI>Denain,</HI> by the fatal Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms.</P>
<P>Whatever Rea&s;on they had for wear|ing
<PB REF="14">
it, I am glad they had not an Op|portunity of making u&s;e of it, in the Triumph they de&s;ign'd over the Laws and Liberties of their Country.</P>
<P>Here I can't omit taking notice how much the Popi&s;h Faction encrea&s;ed un|der the traiterous Management of the late Mini&s;try, and we &s;ee by their dai|ly In&s;ults, that 'tis at the hazard of Life or Intere&s;t, at lea&s;t, that we dare vindicate our Religion, and Liberty. Had the Author of Lady <HI>Jane Grey</HI> made her a Papi&s;t, and <HI>Gardiner</HI> a Bi|&s;hop of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Play been repre&s;ented on the <HI>French</HI> Stage, what Prote&s;tant would have dar'd to call it a <HI>Popi&s;h Play,</HI> without run|ning the Danger of the Gallies? If the Title of a certain Monarch, who was al|&s;o &s;et up by the People, in Oppo&s;ition to the Right Line, were to be repre&s;ented on the Theatre of <HI>France,</HI> not even the fir&s;t Peer of that Nation dur&s;t to have vented one Murmur, much le&s;s his, with|out he were furni&s;h'd with Philo&s;ophy
<PB REF="15" MS="y">
enough to endure the <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> and yet the Papi&s;ts and their Abettors dare to do it here. It is with the utmo&s;t Indignation, that I &s;ee tho&s;e whol&s;ome Laws neglected, which ought to be put in Execution again&s;t &s;uch profe&s;s'd Enemies of our Church and State; for to the Indolence of our Peo|ple in Power, are all our pre&s;ent Divi&s;ions and Di&s;tractions owing; tho' for the Author of that excellently writ Poem a|bove-mention'd, I dare an&s;wer for him, is under no Concern for any Thing that Faction can either &s;ay or write, &s;ince 'tis very evident their Malice is not levell'd again&s;t him but again&s;t our Religion and Liberties, which he has in that Piece vindicated &s;o well, and &s;et the Cru|elties of <HI>Rome</HI> in &s;o true a Light, that a great Part of our Clergy may blu&s;h to &s;ee the Stage become a better Advocate for <HI>Prote&s;tanti&s;m</HI> than the Pulpit; and as oft as that Tragedy &s;hall be repre&s;ented the Author's Memory &s;hall be honoured to Po&s;terity, whil&s;t tho&s;e Pretenders to the Church, the <HI>High-Flying</HI> and <HI>Nonju|ring-Party</HI>
