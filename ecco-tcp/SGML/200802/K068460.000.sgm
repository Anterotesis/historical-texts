<L>Once I remember, it was told,</L>
<L>When I was &s;carcely nine years old;</L>
<L>The earth had been all flooded o'er,</L>
<L>For &s;ix and thirty days and more;</L>
<L>'Twas the opinion of the wi&s;e,</L>
<L>Who knew the motion of the &s;kies,</L>
<L>The Moon had turn'd her turvy-top&s;y,</L>
<L>And drank her&s;elf into a drop&s;y;</L>
<L>The rea&s;ons given were mo&s;t various:</L>
<L>Some &s;aid the archer Sagittarius,</L>
<L>As he one night was pa&s;&s;ing by,</L>
<L>He let a bearded arrow fly;</L>
<L>And to this day &s;ome folks will tell ye,</L>
<L>He hit the Moon plump in the belly;</L>
<L>Which tapping her, for five weeks a'ter,</L>
<L>She teemed upon the earth her water.</L>

Other gave out it was her grief,</L>
