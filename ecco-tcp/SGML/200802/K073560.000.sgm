<HEAD>SPEECH OF MR. SHERIDAN, IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, On FRIDAY the 21&s;t of APRIL, 1798, On the Motion to Addre&s;s HIS MAJESTY, On the pre&s;ent alarming State of Affairs.</HEAD>
<P>MR. SHERIDAN ro&s;e and &s;aid: "I tru&s;t, Sir, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for any man who views the &s;ituation of the country at this moment, to conceive that I ri&s;e to oppo&s;e any part of the pre&s;ent Addre&s;s. Undoubtedly, if I had been pre&s;ent upon a former occa&s;ion, when the Right Honourable and Learned Gentleman brought in his Bill for the better defence of the country, tho' I might have excepted to particular pa&s;&s;ages, I &s;hould certainly have given it my mo&s;t cordial and zealous &s;upport: and in doing &s;o I beg to have it under&s;tood, that in the main points of it, I do not con&s;ider it as having conferred any new powers upon the Crown. Sir, I tru&s;t there is no man who does not know that in ca&s;es of peril out of the ordinary cour&s;e and contemplation of the law, the King is armed with full powers to call out the whole energy of the kingdom. In dome&s;|tic outrages, this is in the power of a common con&s;table; undoubtedly then it is not &s;uppo&s;ed by
<PB N="2" REF="2">
the Con&s;titution, that in the danger and appre|hen&s;ion of a foreign inva&s;ion the King is to be a mere looker on. In that re&s;pect, therefore, I think that whatever &s;ervice any man may give, he will do no more than he is bound by his allegiance to do. But what I wi&s;h &s;uperadded to this is, to &s;ee a &s;uperior zeal to animate the country; a zeal which it is not in the power of any Mini&s;ter to call forth.</P>
<P>Sir, in times like the&s;e, a common &s;pirit will not do; and when I &s;ay that I wi&s;h to &s;ee a &s;uperior &s;pirit animate the country, I rejoice to &s;ay that I do &s;ee it ri&s;ing: yet at the &s;ame time I mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ay, that there is a &s;ort of &s;upinene&s;s and apathy I admit, which I hope and tru&s;t this Hou&s;e will &s;upply. All &s;ociety is intere&s;ted in the &s;ubject of an inva&s;ion; it is a topic of univer&s;al conver&s;ation and curio&s;ity; but, really there are tho&s;e who con|&s;ider it as a &s;trange phaenomenon which they may wonder at, but which they have no bu&s;ine&s;s with: they &s;eem to wait for it as a &s;hew, rather than dread it as a peril. And, Sir, this does not proceed from di&s;&s;affection or di&s;loyalty, from want of good will, or from attachment to the enemy, much le&s;s does it proceed from any &s;ullenne&s;s, or re&s;entment of wrongs and injuries which they may feel; but from a &s;ort of &s;upinene&s;s and apathy, which makes them not &s;ufficiently alive and awake to the real danger that &s;urrounds us. Sir, &s;ymptoms of this &s;upine|ne&s;s appeared, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, in the voluntary &s;ub&s;criptions. I confe&s;s for one, that I was a friend to that mea&s;ure; and I hope the Hou&s;e will not think it ari&s;es from any vanity, that I call their attention to the motion which I then made.</P>
<P>I moved, Sir, after having recommended the vo|luntary &s;ub&s;criptions without any Bill, in order to give the country an opportunity for doing this, for giving a practical pledge, for &s;hewing that upon
<PB N="3" REF="3">
this one &s;ubject at lea&s;t they would be unanimous and cordial, I moved, Sir, the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the A&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed Tax Bill for one month. I &s;hould be &s;orry, indeed, that any men who had voted with me upon that que&s;tion, &s;hould afterwards revile the mea&s;ure as a begging box; for what &s;ort of con&s;i&s;tency would mine be, of recommending the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Tax Bill, if I &s;hould immediately turn back, and call it a begging box of the Mi|ni&s;ters:&mdash;I &s;hould be &s;orry, I &s;ay, to think that any &s;uch language &s;hould have been made u&s;e of; I wi&s;hed the mea&s;ure of voluntary contributions to be tried without the Bill, becau&s;e I wi&s;hed it as a practical pledge and proof of the zeal and &s;pirit of the country. At pre&s;ent, however, no inference is to be made from the names of per&s;ons who contributed to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed taxed, not appearing in that li&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir, with regard to that apathy and &s;upinene&s;s, I have not the &s;lighte&s;t idea but that immediately upon the appearance of real danger, it would di&s;|appear; but there is much in previous preparation, not merely as to di&s;cipline and defence, but in the prompt avowal of the determination of the country. Sir, I have no doubt that the fir&s;t drop of Briti&s;h blood that &s;hall be &s;hed by Frenchmen on Briti&s;h ground, will rai&s;e &s;uch a &s;pirit of valouros fury as mu&s;t be invincible and irre&s;i&s;table. <HI>(An univer&s;al cry of hear, hear!)</HI>&mdash;But Gentlemen have not &s;uf|ficiently calculated what the effects would be of any &s;ucce&s;sful impre&s;&s;ion of French force upon the country. Sir, without retracting any one opinion which I have ever held, I do not conceive that there ever was any period of our hi&s;tory, in which the conque&s;t of the kingdom by a foreign power would bring &s;uch total ruin upon it, as the con|que&s;t of Great Britain by the pre&s;ent French Re|public.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">
Sir, though deprecating the calamities to which the Republic has given ri&s;e, I never wi&s;hed the re&s;toration of Monarchy in France. I am not re|joicing that France has attained &s;uch power, that &s;he arrived at it by the coalition of the powers of Europe again&s;t her, and that if &s;he had been &s;uf|fered to remain as &s;he was, &s;he would not have at|tained that power; but I am &s;aying that the im|pre&s;&s;ion of French force now would be more fatal than at any former period of our hi&s;tory. Yet when I a&s;&s;ert that I &s;till hold my opinions, perhaps the Right Honourable Gentleman may not think this ob&s;ervation well placed, but I do think that if the unfortunate per&s;on who may be entitled to the Crown of France, &s;hould from a general &s;pirit of loyalty in the country, and by a re&s;toration as little expected as our own in the time of Charles the Second, be rai&s;ed to the Throne, and the Emi|grants who had &s;uffered mo&s;t by the Revolution, were to be called back: I &s;ay, Sir, I do not believe that it would abate one atom of the ambition of France, or induce her to give back one particle of her power. I do not believe that her councils, though compo&s;ed of per&s;ons who had been mo&s;t encouraged and protected in other countries, would relinqui&s;h one conque&s;t atchieved by the Republic, would give up one inch of the boundary of the Rhine, withdraw one man from Italy, abandon an acre of the low Countries, or above all, depart from the principle of doing every thing to wre&s;t the &s;overeignty of the &s;eas from Great Britain. Though I dread the Republic of France, I &s;hould not dread le&s;s the Monarchy of France; and in &s;peaking of the Republic, I beg not to be under|&s;tood as a per&s;on mixing in that &s;pirit of per&s;onality and invective which has been adopted, and which I mu&s;t expre&s;s my regret at &s;eeing continued in a clau&s;e of a Bill which has lately pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">
Sir, when we have been a&s;king for peace with the Government of France, I do not think it wi&s;e to charge them with cruelty, inju&s;tice, and op|pre&s;&s;ion. Equally too &s;hould I reprobate any idea of animating the country by the coar&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of Mon&s;ter Hoche and Ruffian General, which have been imputed to a per&s;on in a high &s;ituation in another country. Sir, in&s;tead of re&s;orting to &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, I would, on the contrary, pay the French a &s;olid and &s;incere compliment, and I will tell you what that compliment &s;hould be; by knowing what they have done, and judging what they are capable of, I would omit no one human preparation that might enable us to make a &s;uc|ce&s;sful re&s;i&s;tance to the utmo&s;t their daring could attempt. That is the compliment I would pay them&mdash;that is the way I would meet them. It is not in any mortal power to &s;ay they &s;hall not &s;ub|due us, but at lea&s;t we may take care they &s;hall not de&s;pi&s;e us. Sir, if I were to allude to Bouna|parte, I would not recur to &s;uch invective. I would neither call him mon&s;ter nor a ruffian.&mdash;He is certainly a great man, and if he takes the command of the expedition again&s;t this country, he will not tarni&s;h his laurels by de&s;erving tho&s;e epithets. But I would at lea&s;t di&s;tru&s;t his profe&s;|&s;ions&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Right re&s;tored, freedom regained; Peace to commerce. Peace to cottages. He will come for the humane and liberal purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing liberty."</Q> Can any thing be more glorious, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, more godlike than this? But is there any Engli&s;hman &s;o ab&s;urd, &s;o be&s;otted and befooled as to give credit to one word of it? But may not Republics be actuated by great and generous &s;entiments? Undoubtedly they may; but I mu&s;t fir&s;t look to the nature and con&s;titution of tho&s;e Republics.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6">
In the early and virtuous times of Rome, they did conquer for glory, and to re&s;tore to people their rights. In the Spartan Republic too, I can conceive the &s;ame, and that they might conquer for fame, and not for the acqui&s;ition of tho&s;e lux|uries, which they con&s;idered as inimical to the Republican &s;pirit. But let Gentleman look to the con&s;titution and practice of the Republic of France. Do they not &s;ee that their tree of liberty is planted in the garden of monarchy, and that it bears the &s;ame luxuriant fruit? Are they not eager for all the luxuries and refinements to make their capital the &s;chool and mart of elegance for the world? What do they want? Glory? They are gorged with it. Territory? They have more, perhaps, than they will be able to retain. <HI>What is it they want? Ships, commerce, manufactures, ca&s;h, capital, and credit;</HI> or in other words, they <HI>only</HI> want the finews, bones, marrow, and heart's-blood of Great Britain.&mdash;[<HI>Loud and univer&s;al cries of hear! hear! accompanied with clapping of hands</HI>] Give them that, and they will give you as much liberty in return as you plea&s;e. They call you a nation of merchants; well, they &s;tile you &s;o by way of deri&s;ion; but, at lea&s;t, in dealing with them for their commodity I &s;hould deal as merchants indeed; as merchants give no tru&s;t to the mere name of a commodity, but are apt to enquire into the <HI>reality</HI> of the article. No, I would have our political merchants ju&s;t a&s;k, whether the liberty they have for foreign exportation is or is not different from what they keep for their own home con&s;umption; on this ground alone the barter mu&s;t proceed.&mdash;[<HI>Laughter, hear! hear!.</HI>] But, Sir, look to what mu&s;t be the policy of the French. We know how little real liberty they have at home.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">
I will not take upon my&s;elf to judge how far, in a revolutionary &s;tate the&s;e mea&s;ures may or may not be nece&s;&s;ary: I am willing to grant, that if the men are entru&s;ted with the will of the majority of France, who&s;e de&s;ire is that France &s;hall be a Republic, they mu&s;t do that which is requi&s;ite to fulfil that end. But then, Sir, without throwing any blame on tho&s;e men, I would a&s;k whether they would let us have more liberty in England than they po&s;&s;e&s;s in France? Would they leave us, unimpared, the important right of the trial by Jury? Would they&mdash;in &s;hort, Sir, would they leave this country to be a contra&s;t to the violence practi&s;|ed in France, and to be an eternal and marked re|proach to the conduct of the Directory? No, they would be madmen if they did.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, after having con&s;idered what would be their policy, we mu&s;t look to another motive; we mu&s;t con&s;ider the nature of their enmity. Again, I will avoid &s;aying any thing har&s;h upon the provocations given them; I will do nothing but regret the per&s;onalities that have been u&s;ed, both individually and generally. I purpo&s;ely re|frain from all comments; but that we have provoked and in&s;ulted them beyond human pa|tience is the fact. I will not now di&s;cu&s;s whether we were the aggre&s;&s;ors or not; but the more I think we were &s;o&mdash;the more I think we indulged in per|&s;onalities&mdash;the more mu&s;t I give them credit for the &s;incerity of their revenge again&s;t this country. Will any man believe that vengeance would be di&s;criminating or moderate? Sir, with this view of the con&s;equences of any &s;ucce&s;sful impre&s;&s;ion upon the part of the French, unque&s;tionably the next con&s;ideration is, what mea&s;ures are nece&s;&s;ary to en&s;ure a &s;ucce&s;sful re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Without a&s;king any per&s;on to lay a&s;ide animo|&s;ities to Government, who I &s;hould tru&s;t, have too
<PB N="8" REF="8">
much &s;pirit to &s;teal an indemnity from tho&s;e who may arraign their conduct, I think it &s;hould be manife&s;ted throughout the country, that upon this point of re&s;i&s;ting the enemy, there is but one heart and one opinion. If I &s;hould hear per&s;ons &s;ay, we would do every thing to oppo&s;e the French, but how can we do it without &s;upporting Mini&s;ters? I would &s;ay, I cannot &s;top to di&s;cu&s;s that point now&mdash;I will oppo&s;e the French fir&s;t, and then I will talk with you upon it. If there are per&s;ons who a&s;&s;ert, that they who brought us into this &s;ituation ought to bring us out of it, I &s;hould reply; that I do not object to their logic; but I object a good deal to their prudence. Becau&s;e, if they &s;ay that our pre&s;ent &s;ituation is owing to the incapaci|ty of his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, and if they wi&s;h to re&s;i&s;t the French, they mu&s;t be &s;ure that the French will be foiled, and in that ca&s;e they do not believe in the incapacity of Mini&s;ters, or, if they do be|lieve in their incapacity, they are not &s;incere in wi&s;hing the French to be re&s;i&s;ted</P>
<P>There are Gentlemen who are decidedly adver&s;e to the French, yet they will not come with their whole zeal again&s;t them. They mea&s;ure off &s;o much of their enmity to the French, again&s;t &s;o much of their enmity to Mini&s;ters. They &s;ay they feel great grievances again&s;t the pre&s;ent Govern|ment, and yet that they think a French inva&s;ion the wor&s;t of all evils that can befall the country; if &s;uch men do not think it nece&s;&s;ary to do their ut|mo&s;t to re&s;i&s;t that evil, they have no more common &s;en&s;e than they who think the pre&s;ent to be the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible Governments. Sir, it is childi&s;h in any per&s;on to &s;ay that they will wait till the French have effected a landing. In God's name, if the enemy are to be re&s;i&s;ted, let us do it effectually. It is no part of effectual re&s;i&s;tance that the mind of the country &s;hould be manife&s;ted and the prepa|rations
<PB N="9" REF="9">
be prompt: Sir, to &s;ay that we will not pledge our&s;elves but in the la&s;t extremity, is pledg|ing our&s;elves only to a modified oppo&s;ition, and to a diluted &s;pirit; it is lending the left arm to our country, but &s;aying that we re&s;erve the right&mdash;It is taking the field with a pi&s;tol, but declaring to go the length of a mu&s;quet. On the&s;e grounds it is, that I wi&s;h to behold a higher zeal manife&s;ted than at pre&s;ent &s;eems to pervade the country, though I confe&s;s I &s;ee &s;uch a zeal ri&s;ing. And at the &s;ame time, when I wi&s;h to &s;ee private party give way to public duty, I mu&s;t al&s;o hope, that the &s;ame principle will influence the conduct of Government, and that whoever offers his &s;ervices, in whatever rank, or &s;ituation he may offer them, they &s;hall be joyfully accepted. Services from the highe&s;t &s;tation have been offered, and from the mo&s;t gallant and approved officers.</P>
<P>Sir, I will not mark more &s;trongly what I have alluded to, and I hope no per&s;on will find it nece&s;|&s;ary to recur to the ob&s;ervation. There are many matters of detail connected with this mea&s;ure, to which, undoubtedly, Mini&s;ters will turn their minds. Without making large ma&s;&s;es of idle men, there are great bodies who might produce a con|&s;iderable force. To the&s;e the attention of Govern|ment &s;hould be immediately directed. It is idle to &s;ee per&s;ons a&s;king what will become of us, with two hulking fellows behind their coaches! There is, Sir, another de&s;cription of per&s;ons, who I am con&s;cious do not want &s;pirit, but the idea has not yet occurred to them, whom I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee employed in another way. I mean tho&s;e young Gentlemen of high rank, who pa&s;s their time in forageing the fruit &s;hops, in patrolling Bond-&s;treet and Piccadilly, previous to their taking the field in Rotten-row. Sir, I am not &s;aying that indul|gence in the&s;e luxuries is to be condemned, nor
<PB N="10" REF="10">
will any one &s;u&s;pect me, I believe, of being a too rigid cen&s;or. No man is more di&s;po&s;ed to give credit to tho&s;e per&s;ons; and &s;ure I am, that in the hour of peril, they will be &s;een at their po&s;ts, and not found to be dependant emigrants.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, with every de&s;ire to &s;ee the mo&s;t vigorous preparations made to re&s;i&s;t the enemy, I mu&s;t yet hope, that the enemy not being landed, undoubtedly, the de&s;ire for peace, &s;o far from be|ing checked, will be more manife&s;t and eager. Sir, I have no he&s;itation in &s;aying, though it looks, but in reality, does not detract from our means, that the real death-blow to this country, will not come from the arms of France, but from the utter im|po&s;&s;ibility, if the pre&s;ent &s;cale of expence is to be per&s;evered in, of collecting the burthens from the people. Yet if it be nece&s;&s;ary, we mu&s;t &s;hew the enemy, (for their ruin, whatever they may boa&s;t to the contrary, would infallibly follow ours) that we can, if they de&s;troy our re&s;ources, be as de&s;perate as they. But the real fire and &s;word which, I fear, will alone lay wa&s;te the Briti&s;h Empire, is to be found in the pen and tongue of the Briti&s;h Chan|cellor of the Exchequer; in that pen and tongue, who&s;e eloquence, great as undoubtedly it is, fur|ni&s;hes pretexts to the Hou&s;e to adopt all his mea|&s;ures. I have &s;aid thus much, in order that no preparations, however vigorous, no confidences, however great, in his re&s;ources, may deter his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ter from concluding peace, except|ing only in one &s;ituation; and in that one, much as I wi&s;h for peace, yet I would have any Mini&s;ter, unle&s;s under circum&s;tances which I will not allude to, beware how he treats for peace with a French army landed in this country, and in arms. That would indeed break the &s;pirit and heart of the country. We might get rid of the enemy for a week or two; but the wound would be mortal; we
<PB N="11" REF="11">
&s;hould break the heart of the navy for ever&mdash;<HI>(Loud cries of hear! hear! from every part of the Hou&s;e.)</HI>&mdash;I am glad to &s;ee that I need not pre&s;s the point more.</P>
<P>With regard to the principles upon which I would recommend unanimity, I hope and tru&s;t no man will under&s;tand, that I mean to recommend a jobbing, &s;hifting union with the pre&s;ent Admi|ni&s;tration&mdash;No, Sir, no.&mdash;There are &s;ins on this &s;ubject which I will not now reproach, but which I never &s;hall forget. The unanimity I wi&s;h is a|gain&s;t the French, and it is the only unanimity which can be &s;ucce&s;sful. I do &s;ay, that all public &s;pirit, all confidence in public men has been more di&s;couraged and cru&s;hed by tho&s;e who le&s;t the Whig party, under the pretence of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the cau&s;e of religion and morality, than by any men that ever lived. And here I mu&s;t do the Right Honourable Gentleman and his friends the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that I have not di&s;covered &s;uch a rage and eagerne&s;s for pen&s;ions and emoluments in them, as in tho&s;e who joined the &s;tandard of religion, mora|lity, and civil &s;ociety. The&s;e, beyond all other men, &s;hould endeavour to repair the injury they have done. When, therefore, I &s;peak of union, I mean prompt and vigorous union again&s;t the French&mdash;eternal &s;eparation from his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters. We mu&s;t have no more coalitions. The country is tired of and abhors them. Men talk of the mi&s;|chief of party di&s;putes; but I &s;ay, Sir, that late party reconciliations have done more to break the &s;pirit of the people, than all the party enmity that ever exi&s;ted. I think, at the &s;ame time, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary, if the people are properly rou&s;ed to a &s;en&s;e of their &s;ituation, that they &s;hould look to the lead which this or that man may give them. No man thinks higher of the head and heart, the &s;oul and &s;pirit of my Right Hon. Friend, than I
<PB N="12" REF="12">
do. He, I am &s;ure, as much as any man, looks with abhorrence at the attempts of the enemy. That the&s;e are his &s;entiments, I have no doubt. But I &s;ay that looking after men does not become the &s;pirit of the people in times like the&s;e.</P>
<P>When I am told that in a country of eight mil|lions of men, enlightened as they are, and who have &s;o long enjoyed liberty, &s;ubject now undoubt|edly to re&s;trictions; when I am told, I &s;ay, that there are only one or two men who can &s;ave it, my an&s;wer is, that may be the ca&s;e, but that the country is not worth &s;aving, and cannot be &s;aved. Some there are who may think the Right Hon. Gentleman oppo&s;ite to me, others my Right Hon|ourable Friend, and &s;ome that a Noble Earl, for whom certainly I have a high re&s;pect, are the fit|te&s;t per&s;ons to &s;ave the country; but will any man tell me that there are only two or three men who can do it? I &s;ay if they do tell me &s;o, I repeat, that it is not worth being &s;aved, and cannot be &s;aved. Sir, refer it to the people them&s;elves. A&s;k them what they will do? I don't want a return of legs and arms, but give me a return of the heart and &s;pirit of the country, and I will tell you then whe|ther it can be conquered. Nay, if all the great men were bani&s;hed from the country, I do not believe that it could be hu&s;tled out of its &s;tation and importance. There would then, I have no doubt, be found men capable of pre&s;erving it.</P>
<P>Sir, I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay a few words upon one &s;ubject; but we are &s;peaking in &s;habby times, and I may therefore be excu&s;ed. I think it right for my&s;elf to &s;ay, though I am not &s;uch a cox|comb as to hint that I was ever tempted; and Gentlemen may ri&s;e and do me the ju&s;tice to &s;up|po&s;e I act from principle; but &s;peaking in &s;u&s;pi|cious times, I think it right, Sir, to declare that my political enmity is irreconcileable to the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="13" REF="13">
Admini&s;tration &s;eparately and collectively. Per&s;onal enmity I have none. That my attach|ment to my Right Honourable Friend is unal|terable; that my determination to per&s;i&s;t in pro|curing Reform is un&s;haken; that it is the greate&s;t &s;ecurity we can have; and that the time, I tru&s;t, will yet come for calling his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters to account for their conduct. The&s;e are the pledges which I feel it nece&s;&s;ary to give; and by which I wi&s;h to be tried.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t &s;ay that I &s;hould think my&s;elf the meane&s;t of mankind, if from preference to party prai&s;e, from enmity to the Right Hon. Gentleman, from prejudice to friends, and above all, if from a ba&s;e and unmanly fear of bringing my&s;elf into a &s;ituation of peril, I &s;hould refrain from doing every thing, with my whole heart and &s;oul, to re&s;i&s;t the wor&s;t calamity that could befall the country.</P>
<P>Sir, upon this ground I think it right to call upon all per&s;ons; upon tho&s;e who have profited by the war, for what in others would be patrioti&s;m, in them is duty; I call upon the per&s;onal friends of the Right Hon. Gentleman, who value his &s;afety; I call upon tho&s;e who are friends to Parliamentary Reform, and of whom it has been &s;aid that they u&s;ed it only as a pretence and &s;talking-hor&s;e for trea&s;on, I call upon them to &s;hew that they have been libelled. I call upon tho&s;e who have pledged them&s;elves to bring his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters to ac|count, to prove that they are worthy of that im|portant office.</P>
<P>Sir, I tru&s;t I need not &s;ay that this and every mea&s;ure which tends to provide re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the enemy, and a remedy to the danger which &s;urround us, &s;hall have my warme&s;t and mo&s;t cordial &s;upport.</P>
