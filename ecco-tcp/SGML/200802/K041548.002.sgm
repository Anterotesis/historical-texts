<L><HI>Yet one excelling Greek, &amp;c.</HI>]</L>
<P>Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us, the celebrated hi&s;torian and critic of the Augu&s;tan age, who &s;ettled in Italy, as he him&s;elf informs us, on the clo&s;e of the civil war. He has addre&s;&s;ed a little treati&s;e, contain|ing a critique on the elder hi&s;torians, to his friend Cnaeus Pompeius, whom the French cri|tics &s;uppo&s;e to be Pompey the Great; but Rei&s;ke, the la&s;t editor of Diony&s;ius, has &s;unk him into a petty Greek grammarian, the client or freed|man of that illu&s;trious Roman.</P>
<P>In this treati&s;e of Diony&s;ius, and in one &s;till longer, on the character of Thucydides, there are &s;ome excellent hi&s;torical precepts, which Mr. Spelman has judiciou&s;ly thrown together in the preface to his admirable tran&s;lation of the Roman Antiquities.&mdash;He introduces them by the fol|lowing ob&s;ervation, which may &s;erve perhaps to recommend the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent poem.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"So much has been &s;aid, both by the antients
<PB N="93" REF="93">
and the moderns, in prai&s;e of the advantages re|&s;ulting from the &s;tudy of Hi&s;tory, particularly by Diodorus Siculus among the former, in the noble preface to his Hi&s;torical Collections; and by the late Lord Bolingbroke, among the mo|derns, in his admirable letter on that &s;ubject; that I am a&s;toni&s;hed no treati&s;e has ever yet ap|peared in any age, or any language, profe&s;&s;edly written to pre&s;cribe rules for writing Hi&s;tory; a work allowed to be of the greate&s;t advan|tage of all others to mankind, the repo&s;itory of truth, fraught with le&s;&s;ons both of public and private virtue, and enforced by &s;tronger motives than precepts&mdash;by examples. Rules for Poetry and Rhetoric have been written by many au|thors, both antient and modern, as if delight and eloquence were of greater con&s;equence than in&s;truction: however, Rhetoric was a part of Hi&s;tory, as treated by the antients; not the principal part indeed, but &s;ub&s;ervient to the prin|cipal; and calculated to apply the facts exhibited by the narration. I know it may be &s;aid, that many antient hi&s;tories are &s;till pre&s;erved, and
<PB N="94" REF="94">
that the&s;e models are &s;ufficient guides for mo|dern Hi&s;torians, without particular rules: &s;o had the Greeks Poets of all denominations in their hands, and yet Ari&s;totle thought it nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;cribe particular rules to his countrymen for applying tho&s;e examples to every branch of Poetry: I wi&s;h he had done the &s;ame in Hi&s;tory; if he had, it is very probable that his precepts would have rendered the be&s;t of our modern Hi&s;tories more perfect, and the wor&s;t, le&s;s abo|minable.&mdash;Since the re&s;urrection of letters, the want of &s;uch a guide has been complained of by many authors, and particularly by Rapin, in the preface to his Hi&s;tory of England."</Q><BIBL>&mdash;Spelman, page 15.</BIBL>&mdash;But this ingenious and learned wri|ter &s;peaks a little too &s;trongly, in &s;aying no treati&s;e has ever appeared in any age or language, con|taining rules for Hi&s;tory. There is one in Latin by the celebrated Vo&s;&s;ius, entitled Ars Hi&s;tori|ca; another by Hubertus Folieta, an elegant Latin writer, of the 16th century, on whom Thuanus be&s;tows the highe&s;t commendation; and Ma&s;cardi, an Italian critic, patroni&s;ed by
<PB N="95" REF="95">
Cardinal Mazarine, has written al&s;o dell Arte Hi&s;torica. The curious reader may find a &s;in|gular anecdote relating to the publication of this work in Bayle, under the article Ma&s;cardi.&mdash;But to return to Diony&s;ius. In comparing Hero|dotus and Thucydides, he cen&s;ures the latter with a degree of &s;everity unwarranted by truth and rea&s;on: indeed this &s;everity appeared &s;o &s;triking to the learned Fabricius, that he &s;eems to con&s;ider it as a kind of proof, that the cri|tical works of Diony&s;ius were compo&s;ed in the ha&s;ty fervor of youth. They are however in general, to u&s;e the words of the &s;ame ingenious author, eximia &amp; lectu digna; and a valuable critic of our own country, who re&s;embles Diony|&s;ius in elegance of compo&s;ition, and perhaps in &s;everity of judgment, has &s;poken yet more warm|ly in their favour.&mdash;<BIBL>See Warton's E&s;&s;ay on Pope, 3d edit. page 175.</BIBL></P>

If the chief Pyramid were de&s;igned for a place of burial, what occa&s;ion was there for a well, and for pa&s;|&s;ages of communication which led to other build|ings? Near the Pyramids are apartments of a wonderful fabric, which extend in length one thou&s;and four hundred feet, and about thirty in depth. They have been cut out of the hard rock, and brought to a perpendicular by the arti&s;t's chizel; and through dint of labour fa&s;hioned as they now appear. They were undoubtedly de|&s;igned for the reception of prie&s;ts; and con&s;e|quently were not appendages to a tomb, but to a temple of the Deity . . . . . . The prie&s;ts of Egypt delighted in ob&s;curity; and they probably came by the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages of the build|ing to the dark chambers within; where they per|formed

<L><HI>Sarca&s;tic Tacitus, abrupt and dark.</HI>]</L>
<P>Tacitus was born, according to the conjecture of Lip&s;ius, in the clo&s;e of the reign of Claudius: pa&s;&s;ing through various public honours, he ro&s;e at length to the con&s;ular dignity, under Nerva, in the year of Chri&s;t 97. The date of his death is unknown,
<PB N="118" REF="118">
but he is &s;aid to have lived happily to an ad|vanced age with his wife, the amiable daughter of the virtuous Agricola, who&s;e life he has &s;o beautifully written. By this lady he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have left children; and the emperor Tacitus is conjectured to have been a remote de&s;cendant from the Hi&s;torian, to who&s;e works and memo|ry he paid the highe&s;t regard.&mdash;It is reported by Sidonius Apollinaris, that Tacitus recommended the province of writing Hi&s;tory to Pliny the Younger, and that he did not him&s;elf engage in that employment, till his friend had declined it. This is not mentioned, indeed, in any of the beautiful letters &s;till remaining from Pliny to Ta|citus; but it is an in&s;tance of delicacy not unpa|rallel'd among the Antients, as will appear from the following remark by one of the mo&s;t elegant and liberal of modern critics.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The Roman Poet, who was not more eminent by his genius than amiable in his moral character, affords per|haps the mo&s;t remarkable in&s;tance that any where occurs, of the conce&s;&s;ions which a mind &s;trongly impregnated with &s;entiments of genuine

Virgil's &s;uperior ta|lents rendered him qualified to excel in all the no|bler &s;pecies of poetical compo&s;ition: neverthele&s;s, from the mo&s;t uncommon delicacy of friend&s;hip, he &s;acrificed to his intimacy with Horace, the unrivall'd reputation he might have acquired by indulging his lyric vein; as from the &s;ame refined motive he forbore to exerci&s;e his dramatic pow|ers, that he might not ob&s;cure the glory of his friend Varius.<Q><L>Aurum et opes et rura, frequens donabit amicus:</L>

<P>As to Tacitus, it is clear, I think, from the Letters of Pliny, as well as from his own mo&s;t plea&s;ing Life of Agricola, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the refined and affectionate feelings of the heart in a very high degree, though the general ca&s;t of his hi&s;torical works might lead us to imagine that au&s;terity was his chief characteri&s;tic.&mdash;It would be ea&s;y to fill a volume in tran&s;cribing the great

encomiums, and the violent cen&s;ures, which have been lavi&s;hed by modern writers of almo&s;t every country on this profound Hi&s;torian.&mdash;The la&s;t critic of eminence, who has written again&s;t him, in Britain, is, I believe, the learned Author of The Origin and Progre&s;s of Language; who, in his 3d volume of that work, has made many cu|rious remarks on the compo&s;ition of the antient Hi&s;torians, and is particularly &s;evere on the dic|tion of Tacitus.

<P>It is to be wi&s;hed, that this mo&s;t amiable Mora|li&s;t and Biographer had added a Life of him&s;elf, to tho&s;e which he has given to the world: as the particulars, which other Writers have pre&s;erved of his per&s;onal Hi&s;tory, are very doubtful and imperfect. According to the learned Fabricius,
<PB N="121" REF="121">
he was born under Claudius, 50 years after the Chri&s;tian aera, rai&s;ed to the con&s;ular dignity under Trajan, who&s;e preceptor he is &s;aid to have been, and made Procurator of Greece in his old age by the Emperor Adrian&mdash;in the 5th year of who&s;e reign he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have died, at the age of 70. He was married to a mo&s;t amiable woman of his own native town Chaeronea, who&s;e name was Timoxena, and to who&s;e &s;en&s;e and virtue he has borne the mo&s;t affectionate te&s;timo|ny in his moral works; of which it may be re|gretted that we have no elegant tran&s;lation.

<P>My father was a man, who knew both how to govern, and to pay to governors a becoming obe|dience: but in chu&s;ing his actions for my &s;ubject, I am apprehen&s;ive, in the very out&s;et of my work, le&s;t I may be cen&s;ured as the Panegyri&s;t of my own family for writing of my father; that if I &s;peak of him with admiration, my whole Hi&s;tory will be con&s;idered as a fal&s;e and flattering encomium; and if any circum&s;tance, I may have occa&s;ion to mention, leads me, as it were by force, to di&s;ap|prove &s;ome part even of his conduct, I am appre|hen&s;ive, on the other hand, not from the cha|racter
<PB N="127" REF="127">
of my father, but from the very nature of things, that &s;ome malignant cen&s;urers may com|pare me to Cham, the &s;on of Noah; &s;ince there are many, whom envy and malevolence will not &s;uffer to form a fair judgment, and who, to &s;peak in the words of Homer,

For whoever engages in the province of Hi&s;tory, is bound to forget all &s;entiments both of favour and aver&s;ion; and often to adorn his enemies with the highe&s;t commendations, when their actions are entitled to &s;uch reward; and often to cen&s;ure his mo&s;t intimate friends, when the failings of their life and manners require it.&mdash;The&s;e are duties equally incumbent on the Hi&s;torian, which he cannot decline. As to my&s;elf, with regard to tho&s;e who may be affected either by my cen&s;ure or my prai&s;e, I would wi&s;h to a&s;&s;ure them, that I &s;peak both of them, and their conduct, according to the evidence of their actions them&s;elves, or the report of tho&s;e who beheld them; for either the fathers, or the grandfathers, of many per&s;ons now living

were ocular witne&s;&s;es of what I &s;hall record. I have been chiefly led to engage in this Hi&s;tory of my father by the following circum&s;tance:&mdash;It was my fortune to marry Cae&s;ar Nicephorus, of the Bryennian family, a man far &s;uperior to all his cotemporaries, not only in per&s;onal beauty, but in &s;ublimity of under&s;tanding, and all the charms of eloquence! for he was equally the ad|miration of tho&s;e who &s;aw, and tho&s;e who heard him. But that my di&s;cour&s;e may not wander from its pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, let me proceed in my narration!&mdash;He was then, among all men, the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed; and when he marched with the emperor John Comnenus, my brother, on his expedition again&s;t Antioch, and other places in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Barbarians, &s;till unable to ab&s;tain from litera|ry pur&s;uits, even in tho&s;e &s;cenes of labour and fatigue, he wrote various compo&s;itions worthy of remembrance and of honour. But he chiefly ap|plied him&s;elf to the writing an account of what re|lated to my father Alexius, emperor of the Ro|mans, at the reque&s;t of the empre&s;s; reducing in|to
<PB N="129" REF="129">
proper form the tran&s;actions of his reign, whenever the times would allow him to devote &s;hort intervals of lei&s;ure from arms and battle to works of literature, and the labour of compo&s;i|tion. In forming this Hi&s;tory, he deduced his ac|counts from an early period, being directed in this point al&s;o by the in&s;truction of our royal mi&s;|tre&s;s; beginning from the emperor Diogenes, and de&s;cending to the per&s;on, whom he had cho&s;en for the Hero of his Drama&mdash;for this &s;ea&s;on fir&s;t &s;hew|ed my father to be a youth of expectation. Be|fore this period he was a mere infant; and of cour&s;e performed nothing worthy of being recor|ded: unle&s;s even the occurrences of his childhood &s;hould be thought a fit &s;ubject for Hi&s;tory. Such then was the de&s;ign and &s;cope of Cae&s;ar's compo|&s;ition: but he failed in the hope he had entertain|ed, of bringing his Hi&s;tory to its conclu&s;ion: for having brought it to the times of the emperor Nicephorus Botoniates, he there broke off, ha|ving no future opportunity allowed him of conti|nuing his narration: a circum&s;tance which has
<PB N="130" REF="130">
proved a &s;evere lo&s;s to Literature, and robbed his readers of delight!&mdash;On this account I have un|dertaken to record the actions of my father, that &s;uch atchievements may not e&s;cape po&s;terity. What degree of harmony and grace the writings of Cae&s;ar po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, all per&s;ons know who have been fortunate enough to &s;ee his compo&s;itions. But having executed his work to the period I have mentioned, in the mid&s;t of hurry and fa|tigue, and bringing it to us half fini&s;hed from his expedition, he brought home, alas! at the &s;ame time, a di&s;order that proved mortal, contracted perhaps from the hard&s;hips of his pa&s;&s;age, or per|haps from that harra&s;&s;ing &s;cene of perpetual ac|tion, and po&s;&s;ibly indeed from his infinite anxiety on my account; for anxiety was natural to his affectionate heart, and his labours were without intermi&s;&s;ion. Moreover, the change and badne&s;s of climates might prepare for him this draught of death. For notwith&s;tanding the dreadful &s;tate of his health, he per&s;evered in the campaign again&s;t the Syrians and Cilicians, till at length he was
<PB N="131" REF="131">
conveyed out of Syria in a mo&s;t infirm &s;tate, and was brought through Cilicia, Pamphilia, Lydia, and Bithynia, home to the metropolis of the em|pire, and to his family. But his vitals were now affected by his infinite fatigue.&mdash;Even in this &s;tate of weakne&s;s he was de&s;irous of di&s;playing the events of his expedition: but this his di&s;order rendered him unable to execute, and indeed we enjoined him not to attempt it, le&s;t by the effort of &s;uch a narration he &s;hould bur&s;t open his wound.&mdash;But in the recollection of the&s;e things, my whole &s;oul is darkened, and my eyes are co|vered with a flood of tears.&mdash;O what a director of the Roman coun&s;els was then torn from us! O what an end was there to all the trea&s;ures of clear, of various, and of u&s;eful knowledge, which he had collected from ob&s;ervation and experi|ence, both in regard to foreign affairs, and the internal bu&s;ine&s;s of the empire!&mdash;O what a form was then de&s;troyed!&mdash;Beauty, that &s;eemed not only entitled to dominion, but bearing even the &s;emblance of divinity!&mdash;I indeed have been con|ver&s;ant

with every calamity; and have found, even from the imperial cradle, an unpropitious fortune: &s;ome perhaps might e&s;teem that fortune not unpropitious, which &s;eemed to &s;mile upon my birth, in giving me &s;overeigns for my parents, and nur&s;ing me in the imperial purple: but for the other circum&s;tances of my life, alas, what tempe&s;ts! alas, what perturbations! The melody of Orpheus affected even inanimate nature; and Timotheus, in playing the Orthic &s;ong to Alexan|der, made the Macedon &s;tart to arms.</P>

<PB N="133" REF="133">
me, as it were, like a &s;moke preceding this raging fire; they were a kind of heat, that portended a conflagration, which no words can de&s;cribe. O thou fire, that blaze&s;t without fuel, preying on my heart without de&s;troying its exi&s;tence; piercing through my very bones, and &s;hrinking up my &s;oul!&mdash;But I perceive my&s;elf hurried away from my &s;ubject: this mention of Cae&s;ar, and what I &s;uffer in his lo&s;s, has led me into the prolixity of grief: wiping therefore the tear from my eyes, and re&s;training my&s;elf from this indul|gence of &s;orrow, I will proceed in order; yet, as the tragic Poet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Euripides.</NOTE></P>

recital of his reign, &s;upplies to me a new &s;ubject of lamentation, and mu&s;t remind others of the lo&s;s they have &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>But let me at length begin the Hi&s;tory of my father, from the period mo&s;t proper:&mdash;now the mo&s;t proper period is that, which will give to my narration the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t hi&s;torical ap|pearance.&mdash;</P>

<L><HI>A faithful Chronicler in plain Froi&s;&s;art.</HI>]</L>
<P>John Froi&s;&s;art, Canon and Trea&s;urer of the collegiate church of Chimay, in Henault, was born at Va|lenciennes, a city of that province, in 1337, ac|cording to the conjecture of that elaborate and in|genious antiquarian Mr. de St. Palaye; who has amply illu&s;trated the Life and Writings of this engaging Hi&s;torian, in a &s;eries of di&s;&s;ertations among the Memoirs of the French Academy, Vol. X. XIII. XIV.&mdash;St. Palaye imagines, from a pa&s;&s;age in the MS Poems of Froi&s;&s;art, that his father was a painter of Armories&mdash;and it is certain the Hi&s;torian di&s;covers a pa&s;&s;ion for all the pomp and all the minutiae of heraldry: it was indeed the favourite &s;tudy of that martial age; and Froi&s;&s;art, more the prie&s;t of gallantry than of reli|gion, devoted him&s;elf entirely to the celebration of love and war.&mdash;At the age of 20, he began to write Hi&s;tory, at the reque&s;t <HI>de &s;on cher Seigneur &amp; Maitre Me&s;&s;ire</HI> Robert de Namur, Chevalier Seigneur de Beaufort.&mdash;The angui&s;h of un&s;uc|ce&s;sful
<PB N="161" REF="161">
love drove him early into England, and his fir&s;t voyage &s;eems a kind of emblem of his future life; for he &s;ailed hither in a &s;torm, yet continued writing a rondeau in &s;pite of the tem|pe&s;t, till he found him&s;elf on that coa&s;t, ou l'on aime mieux la guerre, que la paix, &amp; ou les e&s;|trangers &s;ont tr&egrave;s bien venus, as he &s;aid of our country <HI>in his ver&s;es,</HI> and happily experienced in his kind reception at court, where Philippa of He|nault, the Queen of Edward the Third, and a Pa|trone&s;s of learning, di&s;tingui&s;hed the young Hi&s;|torian, her countryman, by the kinde&s;t protec|tion; and, finding that love had rendered him un|happy, &s;upplied him with money and with hor&s;es, that he might pre&s;ent him&s;elf with every advan|tage before the object of his pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Love &s;oon e&s;corted him to his mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;but his addre&s;&s;es were again un&s;ucce&s;sful; and, taking a &s;econd voyage to England, he became Secretary to his royal patrone&s;s Philippa, in 1361, after having pre|&s;ented to her &s;ome portion of his Hi&s;tory.&mdash;He continued five years in her &s;ervice, entertaining
<PB N="162" REF="162">
her maje&s;ty <HI>de beaux dictiez &amp; traictez amoureux:</HI> in this period he paid a vi&s;it to Scotland, and was entertained 15 days by William earl Douglas.&mdash;In 1366, when Edward the Black Prince was preparing for the war in Spain, Froi&s;&s;art was with him in Ga&s;cony, and hoped to attend him during the whole cour&s;e of that important expedition:&mdash;but the Prince &s;ent him back to the Queen his mother.&mdash;He continued not long in England, as he vi&s;ited many of the Italian courts in the follow|ing year; and during his travels &s;u&s;tained the irre|parable lo&s;s of that patrone&s;s, to who&s;e bounty he had been &s;o much indebted.&mdash;Philippa died 1369, and Froi&s;&s;art is reported to have written the life of his amiable protectre&s;s; but of this performance the re&s;earches of St. Palaye could di&s;cover no trace.</P>
<P>After this event, he retired to his own country, and obtained the benefice of Le&s;tines, in the dio|ce&s;e of Cambray.&mdash;But the cure of &s;ouls was an office little &s;uited to the gay and gallant Froi&s;&s;art.&mdash;His genius led him &s;till to travel from ca&s;tle to
<PB N="163" REF="163">
ca&s;tle, and from court to court, to u&s;e the words of Mr. Warton, who has made occa&s;ional mention of our author, in his elegant Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Poetry.&mdash;Froi&s;&s;art now entered into the &s;ervice of the Duke of Brabant; and, as that Prince was him&s;elf a poet, Froi&s;&s;art collected all the compo&s;i|tions of his ma&s;ter, and adding &s;ome of his own, formed a kind of romance, which he calls
<Q><L>Un Livre de Meliador</L>
<L>Le Chevalier au &s;oleil d'or,</L></Q>
and of which, in one of his later poems, he gives the following account:<Q><L>Dedans ce Romant &s;ont enclo&s;es</L>
<L>Toutes les chan&ccedil;ons que jadis,</L>
<L>Dont l'ame &s;oit en paradis,</L>
<L>Que fit le bon Duc de Braibant,</L>

<P><PB N="164" REF="164">
The Duke died in 1384, before this work was completed; and Froi&s;&s;art &s;oon found a new patron in Guy earl of Blois, on the marriage of who&s;e Son he wrote a Pa&s;toral, entitled Le Tem|ple d'Honneur.&mdash;The Earl having reque&s;ted him to re&s;ume his Hi&s;tory, he travelled for that pur|po&s;e to the celebrated court of Ga&s;ton earl of Foix, who&s;e high reputation for every knightly virtue attracted to his re&s;idence, at Orlaix, tho&s;e martial adventurers, from who&s;e mouth it was the delight of Froi&s;&s;art to collect the materials of his Hi&s;tory.&mdash;The courteous Ga&s;ton gave him the mo&s;t flat|tering reception: he &s;aid to him with a &s;mile (&amp; en bon Fran&ccedil;ois) <Q REND="inline">"qu'il le connoi&s;&s;oit bien, quoyqu'il ne l'eu&s;t jamais veu, mais qu'il avoit bien oui parler de luy, &amp; le retint de &s;on ho&s;tel."</Q>&mdash;It became a favourite amu&s;ement of the Earl, to hear Froi&s;&s;art read his Romance of Meliador after &s;upper.&mdash;He attended in the ca&s;tle every night at 12, when the Earl &s;ate down to table, li&s;tened to him with extreme attention, and never di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, till he had made him vuider tout ce

<PB N="166" REF="166">
of his life. The ground-work of this poem (which is not in the li&s;t of our Author's poetical pieces, that Mr. Warton has given us from Pa&s;|quier) &s;eems to have a &s;trong vein of humour.&mdash;It is a dialogue between the Poet and the &s;in|gle Florin that he has left, out of the many which he had either &s;pent, or been obliged to &s;urrender to the robbers.&mdash;He repre&s;ents him&s;elf as a man of the mo&s;t expen&s;ive turn: in 25 years he had &s;quandered two thou&s;and franks, be&s;ides his eccle|&s;ia&s;tical revenues. The compo&s;ition of his works had co&s;t him 700; but he regretted not this &s;um, as he expected to be amply repaid for it by the prai&s;e of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>After having attended all the fe&s;tivals on the marriage of the Duke of Berry, having traver&s;ed many parts of France, and paid a vi&s;it to Zeland, he returned to his own country in 1390, to con|tinue his Hi&s;tory from the various materials he had collected.&mdash;But not &s;atisfied with the relations he had heard of the war in Spain, he went to Middlebourgh in Zeland, in pur&s;uit of a Portu|gue&s;e
<PB N="167" REF="167">
Knight, Jean Ferrand Portelet, vaillant homme &amp; &s;age, &amp; du Con&s;eil du Roy de Portu|gal. From this accompli&s;hed &s;oldier Froi&s;&s;art expected the mo&s;t perfect information, as an ocu|lar witne&s;s of tho&s;e &s;cenes which he now wi&s;hed to record.&mdash;The courteous Portelet received our indefatigable Hi&s;torian with all the kindne&s;s which his enthu&s;ia&s;m de&s;erved; and in &s;ix days, which they pa&s;&s;ed together, gave him all the intelligence he de&s;ired.&mdash;Froi&s;&s;art now returned home, and fini&s;hed the third book of his Hi&s;tory.&mdash;Many years had pa&s;t &s;ince he had bid adieu to Eng|land. Taking advantage of the truce then e&s;ta|bli&s;hed between France and that country, he paid it another vi&s;it in 1395, with letters of re|commendation to the King and his uncles.&mdash;From Dover he proceeded to Canterbury, to pay his devoirs at the &s;hrine of Thomas of Becket, and to the memory of the Black Prince.&mdash;Here he happened to find the &s;on of that hero, the young King Richard, whom devotion had al&s;o brought to make his offerings to the fa&s;hionable Saint,
<PB N="168" REF="168">
and return thanks to Heaven for his &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Ireland.&mdash;Froi&s;&s;art &s;peaks of this adventure, and his own feelings on the great change of &s;cene that had taken place &s;ince his la&s;t vi&s;it to England, in the following natural and lively terms:<Q REND="inline">&mdash;Le Roy . . . vint . . a trez grant arroy, et bien accompaigne de &s;eigneurs, de dames, et demoi|&s;elles, et me mis entre eulx, &amp; entre elles, et tout me &s;embla nouvel, ne je ny congnoi&s;&s;oye per|&s;onne; car le tems e&s;toit bien change en Angle|terre depuis le tems de vingt &amp; huyt ans: et en la compagnie du roy n'avoit nuls de &s;es oncles . . . . &s;i fus du premier ain&s;i que tout e&s;bahy . . .</Q> Tho' Froi&s;&s;art was thus embarra&s;&s;ed in not finding one of his old friends in the reti|nue of the King, he &s;oon gained a new Patron in Thomas Percy, Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;ehold, who offered to pre&s;ent him and his letters to Richard; but this offer happening on the eve of the King's departure, it proved too late for the ceremony&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Le Roy e&s;toit retrait pour aller dormir.</Q>&mdash;And on the morrow, when the impatient Hi&s;torian at|tended
<PB N="169" REF="169">
early at the Archbi&s;hop's palace, where the King &s;lept, his friend Percy advi&s;ed him to wait a more convenient &s;ea&s;on for being intro|duced to Richard.&mdash;Froi&s;&s;art acquie&s;ced in this advice, and was con&s;oled for his di&s;appointment by falling into company with an Engli&s;h Knight, who had attended the King in Ireland, and was very willing to gratify the curio&s;ity of the Hi&s;to|rian by a relation of his adventures.&mdash;This was William de Li&s;le, who entertained him, as they rode along together, with the marvels of St. Pa|trick's Cave, in which he a&s;&s;ured him he had pa&s;&s;ed a night, and &s;een wonderful vi&s;ions.&mdash;Though our hone&s;t Chronicler is commonly ac|cu&s;ed of a pa&s;&s;ion for the marvellous, with an ex|ce&s;s of credulity, he &s;ays very &s;en&s;ibly on this oc|ca&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">de cette matiere je ne luy parlay plus avant, et m'en ce&s;&s;ay, car voulentiers je luy eu&s;&s;e demande du voyage d'Irlande, et luy eu voulaye parler, et mettre en voye.</Q>&mdash;It appears plainly from this pa&s;&s;age, that our Hi&s;torian was more anxious to gain information concerning
<PB N="170" REF="170">
the &s;cenes of real action, than to li&s;ten to the ex|travagant fictions of a popular legend.&mdash;But here he was again di&s;appointed.&mdash;New companions joined them on the road, and their hi&s;torical con|ference was thus interrupted.&mdash;The&s;e mortifica|tions were &s;oon repaid by the kind reception he met with from the Duke of York, who &s;aid to him, when he received the recommendatory let|ter from the Earl of Henault, <Q REND="inline">"Mai&s;tre Jehan tenez vous toujours deles nous, &amp; nos gens, nous vous ferons tout amour &amp; courtoi&s;ie, nous y &s;ommes tenus pour l'amour du tems pa&s;&s;&eacute; &amp; de notre dame de mere &agrave; qui vous futes; nous en avons bien la &s;ouvenance."</Q>&mdash;With the&s;e flatter|ing marks of remembrance and favour, the Duke pre&s;ented him to the <Q REND="inline">King, lequel me receut joyeu&s;ement et doulcement (continues Froi&s;|&s;art) . . et ne di&s;t que je fu&s;&s;e le bien venus et &s;i j'avoye e&s;te de l'ho&s;tel du Roy &s;on Ayeul &amp; de Madame &s;on Ayeule encores e&s;toys je de l'ho&s;tel d'Angleterre.</Q>&mdash;Some time however elap&s;ed, before he had an opportunity of pre&s;enting his
<PB N="171" REF="171">
romance of Meliador, which he had prepared for the King.&mdash;The Duke of York and his other friends at length obtained for him this honour. He gives the following curious and particular account of the ceremony: <Q REND="inline">Et voulut veoir le Roy mon livre, que je luy avoye apporte. Si le vit en &s;a chambre: car tout pourveu je l'avoye, et luy mis fur &s;on lict. Et lors il l'ouvrit et regarda dedans, et luy pleut tres grandement.

<P>It may &s;erve as a kind of memento mori to poe|tical vanity, to reflect that Froi&s;&s;art is hardly known as a Poet, though his fertile pen produced 30,000 ver&s;es, which were once the delight of Princes, and the favourite &s;tudy of the gallant and the fair.&mdash;How far he de&s;erved the oblivion into which his poetical compo&s;itions have fallen, the reader may conceive from the following judgment of his French Critic; with who&s;e ingenious re|flection on the imperfections attending the early &s;tate both of Poetry and Painting, I &s;hall termi|nate this Note.</P>

<L><HI>Brought the keen Scribe of Florence into Day.</HI>]</L>
<P>Nicholas Machiavel, the celebrated Florentine, was fir&s;t patronized by Leo, who cau&s;ed one of his comedies to be acted with great magnificence at Rome, and engaged him to write a private Treati&s;e de Reformatione Reipublicae Floren|tinae. His famous political E&s;&s;ay, intitled, "The Prince," was publi&s;hed in 1515, and dedicated to the Nephew of that Pontiff. The various judg|ments that have been pa&s;&s;ed on this &s;ingular per|formance, are a &s;triking proof of the incertitude of human opinion.&mdash;In England it has received applau&s;e from the great names of Bacon and Clarendon, who &s;uppo&s;e it intended to promote
<PB N="178" REF="178">
the intere&s;t of liberty and virtue. In Italy, after many years of approbation, it was publicly con|demned by Clement the VIIIth, at the in&s;tiga|tion of a Je&s;uit, who had not read the book. In France it has even been &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;trumental to the horrid ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bartholomew, as the favourite &s;tudy of Catherine of Medicis and her Sons, and as teaching the bloody le&s;&s;ons of ex|tirpation which they &s;o fatally put in practice. Yet one of his French Tran&s;lators has gone &s;o far as to &s;ay, that <Q REND="inline">"Machiavel, who pa&s;&s;es among all the world for a teacher of Tyranny, dete&s;ted it more than any man of the age in which he lived."</Q> It mu&s;t however be owned, that there is a great mixture of good and evil in his poli|tical precepts. For the latter many plau&s;ible apologies have been made: and it &s;hould be re|membered to his honour, that his great aim was to promote the welfare of his country, in ex|citing the Hou&s;e of Medicis to deliver Italy from the inva&s;ion of foreigners.</P>
<P>He is &s;aid to have been made Hi&s;toriographer
<PB N="179" REF="179">

<L><HI>The clear O&s;orius, in his cla&s;&s;ic phra&s;e.</HI>]</L>
<P>Jerom O&s;orius was born of a noble family at Li&s;bon, 1506. He was educated at the univer&s;ity of Sala|manca, and afterwards &s;tudied at Paris and Bo|logna. On his return to Portugal, he gradually ro&s;e to the Bi&s;hopric of Sylves, to which he was
<PB N="196" REF="196">
appointed by Catherine of Au&s;tria, Regent of the kingdom in the minority of Seba&s;tian. At the reque&s;t of Cardinal Henry of Portugal, he wrote his Hi&s;tory of King Emanuel, and the expedition of Gama&mdash;which his great contemporary Ca|moens made at the &s;ame time the &s;ubject of his immortal Lu&s;iad; a poem which has at length appeared with due lu&s;tre in our language, being tran&s;lated with great &s;pirit and elegance by Mr. Mickle. It is remarkable, that the Hi&s;tory of O&s;orius, and the Epic Poem of Camoens, were publi&s;hed in the &s;ame year, 1572: but the fate of the&s;e two great Authors was very different; the Poet was &s;uffered to peri&s;h in poverty, under the reign of that Henry who patronized the Hi&s;tori|an: yet, allowing for the difference of their pro|fe&s;&s;ions, I am inclined to think they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;imi|larity of mind. There appear many traces of that high heroic &s;pirit, even in the Prie&s;t O&s;orius, which animated the Soldier Camoens; particularly in the plea&s;ure with which he &s;eems to de&s;cribe the martial manners of his countrymen, under the

<L><HI>Iberia's Genius bids ju&s;t Fame allow</HI></L>
<L><HI>As bright a wreath to Mariana's brow.</HI>]</L>
<P>John Mariana was born 1537, at Talavera (a town in the dioce&s;e of Toledo), as he him&s;elf informs us
<PB N="201" REF="201">
in his famous E&s;&s;ay <HI>de Rege,</HI> which opens with a beautiful romantic de&s;cription of a &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot in that neighbourhood, where he enjoyed the plea&s;ures of literary retirement with his friend Cal|deron, a Mini&s;ter of Toledo; who&s;e death he mentions in the &s;ame E&s;&s;ay, commemorating his learning and his virtues in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing terms of affectionate admiration.&mdash;Mariana was admit|ted into the order of Je&s;uits at the age of 17. He travelled afterwards into Italy and France; and returning into Spain in 1574, &s;ettled at Toledo, and died there in the 87th year of his age, 1624.&mdash;Hearing it frequently regretted, in the cour&s;e of his travels, that there was no General Hi&s;tory of his country, he engaged in that great work on his return; and publi&s;hed it in Latin at Toledo, 1592, with a dedication to Philip the IId: where he &s;peaks of his own performance with mode&s;ty and manly freedom, and perhaps with as little flattery as ever appeared in any addre&s;s of that nature, to a Monarch continually fed with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t adulation.&mdash;This elaborate work he
<PB N="202" REF="202">
tran&s;lated into Spani&s;h, but, as he him&s;elf declares, with all the freedom of an original author. He publi&s;hed his Ver&s;ion in 1601, with an addre&s;s to Philip the IIId, in which he laments the decline of Learning in his country; and declares he had him&s;elf executed that work, from his apprehen&s;ion of its being mangled by an ignorant Tran&s;lator. He had clo&s;ed his Hi&s;tory (which begins with the fir&s;t peopling of Spain) with the death of Ferdi|nand, in 1516; but in a &s;ub&s;equent edition, in 1617, he added to it a &s;hort &s;ummary of events to the year 1612. But in the year before he fir&s;t publi&s;hed the Spani&s;h Ver&s;ion of his Hi&s;tory, he addre&s;&s;ed al&s;o to the young Monarch Philip the IIId, his famous E&s;&s;ay which I have mentioned, and which was publicly burnt at Paris, about 20 years after its publication, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that it had excited Ravaillac to the murder of Henry the IVth: though it was a&s;&s;erted, with great proba|bility, by the Je&s;uits, that the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in had never &s;een the book. It is true, indeed, that Mariana in this E&s;&s;ay occa&s;ionally defends Clement the
<PB N="203" REF="203">
Monk, who &s;tabbed Henry the IIId; and it is very remarkable, that he grounds this defence, not on the bigotted tenets of a Prie&s;t, who thinks every thing lawful for the intere&s;t of his church, but on tho&s;e &s;ublime principles of civil liberty, with which an antient Roman would have vindi|cated the dagger of Brutus. Indeed this E&s;&s;ay contains &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages on Government, which would not have di&s;honoured even Cicero him&s;elf; but, it mu&s;t be owned, they are grievou&s;ly di&s;|graced by the la&s;t chapter of the Work, which breathes a furious &s;pirit of eccle&s;ia&s;tical intole|rance, and yet clo&s;es with the&s;e mild and mode&s;t expre&s;&s;ions:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">No&s;trum de regno et Regis in&s;titu|tione judicium forta&s;s&egrave; non omnibus placeat: qui volet &s;equatur; aut &s;uo poti&ugrave;s &s;tet, &s;i potioribus argumentis nitatur: de quibus rebus tantoper&egrave; a&s;|&s;everavi in his libris, eas nunquam veriores quam alienam &s;ententiam affirmabo.

It was again&s;t the pernicious practice of deba&s;ing the public coin; and as it was &s;uppo&s;ed to reflect on the Duke of Lerma, called the Sejanus of Spain, it expo&s;ed the Author, about the year 1609, to the per&s;ecution of that vindictive Mini&s;ter, from which it does not appear how he e&s;caped.&mdash;In|deed the accounts of Mariana's life are very im|perfect. Bayle, whom I have chiefly followed, mentions a life of him by De Vargas, which he could not procure. I have &s;ought after this Bio|grapher with the &s;ame ill &s;ucce&s;s; as I wi&s;hed to give a more perfect account of this great Author, who&s;e per&s;onal Hi&s;tory is little known among us, though it is far from being unworthy of atten|tion.</P>

<L><HI>The fervid Grotius to her glory rais'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>A column, &s;plendid as the feats he prais'd.</HI>]</L>
<P>Hugo Grotius was the elde&s;t child of John de Groot, curator in the univer&s;ity of Leyden, and born at Delft on the 10th of April 1583.&mdash;His infancy gave the faire&s;t promi&s;e of tho&s;e great and univer&s;al talents, which were &s;o amply un|folded in his &s;ub&s;equent life. At the age of eleven he was celebrated as a prodigy of learning.&mdash;When Barnevelt was &s;ent Amba&s;&s;ador to Henry the IVth of France, in 1598, he took the young Grotius in his train, and pre&s;ented him to that Monarch; who honoured the little &s;cholar by graciou&s;ly giving him his picture and a chain of gold. One circum&s;tance was yet wanting to complete the joy of Grotius in this expedition; and he was obliged to quit France without obtaining the great object of his wi&s;hes, a per|&s;onal acquaintance with the Pre&s;ident de Thou.&mdash;
<PB N="206" REF="206">
He afterwards expre&s;&s;ed his mortification on this &s;ubject in a letter to that great man, which gave ri&s;e to a friendly corre&s;pondence between the&s;e congenial characters, highly honourable to both.&mdash;On his return to Holland, Grotius devoted him&s;elf to the practice of the law, and in 1599 pleaded his fir&s;t cau&s;e at Delft. In the exerci&s;e of this laborious profe&s;&s;ion, he found &s;ufficient time to cultivate polite literature. In 1599 he publi&s;hed his edition of Martianus Capella, at the reque&s;t of Scaliger: it was followed, in the &s;ucceeding year, by the Phaenomena of Ara|tus: and in 1601 he printed his fir&s;t tragedy of Adamus Exful, a compo&s;ition which might po&s;|&s;ibly give birth to the divine performance of Mil|ton; though its author e&s;teemed it &s;o little, as to exclude it from a collection of his poems. Gro|tius, indeed, was remarkably mode&s;t in e&s;tima|ting his own poetical talents:&mdash;few per&s;ons have written &s;o many ver&s;es, and thought &s;o humbly of their merit.&mdash;The public proofs which he had now given of his various erudition, procured
<PB N="207" REF="207">
him an honour from his country, the more flat|tering as it was un&s;olicited. The United Pro|vinces, ju&s;tly proud of having vindicated their liberty again&s;t the tyranny of Spain, and de&s;irous of commemorating &s;o noble an event, appointed Grotius their Hi&s;toriographer. A nomination &s;o honourable to a youth, for &s;uch he was, led him to collect materials for that Hi&s;tory; which many accidents con&s;pired to prevent his publi&s;hing, during the whole cour&s;e of his bu&s;y and vexa|tious life.&mdash;From his &s;ucce&s;s at the bar, he was promoted to the po&s;t of Advocate General; and in 1608 he married Maria Reige&s;berg, a lady of a re&s;pectable family in Zealand, and a wife, as his Biographer ob&s;erves, truly worthy of &s;uch a hu&s;band. In 1613 he became Pen&s;ionary of Rotterdam, an office which gave him a &s;eat in the A&s;&s;embly of the States. He was &s;oon after|wards employed in a commi&s;&s;ion to England, to &s;ettle &s;ome national di&s;putes concerning the Greenland Fi&s;hery.&mdash;The greate&s;t plea&s;ure and advantage which he derived from this expedition,
<PB N="208" REF="208">
was the intimacy which he contracted in Eng|land with the celebrated Ca&s;aubon. Soon after his return to Holland, the fatal &s;pirit of religious controver&s;y produced tho&s;e unfortunate and well|known di&s;tractions in his country, which led to the infamous execution of the great and virtuous Barnevelt. Grotius, who was affectionately at|tached to that upright Mini&s;ter, and joined with him in every mea&s;ure to counteract the u&s;urping ambition of Prince Maurice, was thus expo&s;ed to the oppre&s;&s;ion of that vindictive hero.&mdash;After the vain ceremony of an iniquitous trial, he was con|demned to perpetual impri&s;onment; and con|ducted, on the 6th of June 1619, to the fortre&s;s of Louve&s;tein, in South Holland, at the point of the i&s;land formed by the Vahal and the Meu&s;e.&mdash;His tender and faithful wife, who had been cruelly debarred from attending him, even in &s;ickne&s;s, during his confinement at the Hague, was now admitted to &s;hare his pri&s;on; on the hard condition of forfeiting that privilege, if &s;he ever ventured from Louve&s;tein: &s;he afterwards ob|tained
<PB N="209" REF="209">
leave to come abroad twice a week.&mdash;With the &s;pirit of a Roman Matron &s;he refu&s;ed the al|lowance which the government had a&s;&s;igned for the maintenance of her hu&s;band&mdash;continued for almo&s;t two years the con&s;tant attendant on his captivity&mdash;and at length became the glorious in|&s;trument of his deliverance. Grotius, who hap|pily experienced that love and literature are un|failing re&s;ources under the mo&s;t galling calamity of human life, had pur&s;ued his &s;tudies in pri&s;on with his u&s;ual ardour. He compo&s;ed there, among other works, the fir&s;t &s;ketch of his E&s;&s;ay on the Truth of Chri&s;tianity, in a poetical form, and in his native language.&mdash;Reports were &s;pread by his enemies that he had formed a plan for his e&s;cape, and his pri&s;on was rigorou&s;ly examined. But notwith&s;tanding the vigilance of his oppre&s;|&s;ors, the affectionate ingenuity of his wife re&s;to|red him to freedom by the following expedient:&mdash;He had been allowed to borrow books from his friends; and it was u&s;ual with him to &s;end &s;uch as he had read in a che&s;t, that went regu|larly
<PB N="210" REF="210">
with his linen to the neighbouring town of Gorcum. The guards were at fir&s;t very &s;crupu|lous in their examination of this che&s;t; but hav|ing long found in it only books and linen, they were now accu&s;tomed to let it pa&s;s unopened.&mdash;The circum&s;tance &s;ugge&s;ted to the attentive wife of Grotius the po&s;&s;ibility of her hu&s;band's e&s;cape, and &s;he per&s;uaded him to attempt it by this &s;in|gular conveyance. The incidents attending the adventure were highly calculated to increa&s;e the agitation of her heart; and mu&s;t indeed have oc|ca&s;ioned the failure of her de&s;ign, had &s;he not taken the mo&s;t ingenious precautions to en|&s;ure its &s;ucce&s;s:&mdash;The &s;oldiers, who carried the che&s;t in which Grotius was inclo&s;ed, were alarmed by its weight; and cried out, in the pro|verbial language of their country, that it mu&s;t contain an Arminian;&mdash;&s;he replied with great pre&s;ence of mind, that it was indeed loaded with Arminian books. The &s;oldiers were &s;till un|&s;atisfied, and went to the wife of their command|ing officer, who was ab&s;ent, to expre&s;s their &s;u&s;|picion;
<PB N="211" REF="211">
&mdash;&s;he replied, that &s;he had been a&s;&s;ured it contained only books, and bade them carry it to the boat: a female &s;ervant in the &s;ecret attended the che&s;t, and &s;aw it &s;afely conveyed to the hou&s;e of Dazelaer, a friend of Grotius, in Gorcum, from whence he pa&s;&s;ed in di&s;gui&s;e into Brabant. The generous contriver of his e&s;cape now tri|umphed in the &s;ucce&s;s of her project. Being a&s;|&s;ured that her hu&s;band was &s;afe, by the return of her &s;ervant, &s;he avowed what &s;he had done, and was more clo&s;ely confined by the offended com|mandant of Louve&s;tein. But &s;he &s;oon ob|tained her liberty, on pre&s;enting a petition to the States-General; though &s;ome wretches were found in that a&s;&s;embly, brutal enough to expre&s;s a de&s;ire of puni&s;hing a woman for an act of he|roi&s;m, which, in Athens or in Rome, would have almo&s;t rendered her an object of idolatry.&mdash;Her merit, however, has been ju&s;tly celebrated by the poets of her country; but the mo&s;t plea&s;ing me|morial of it appears in a poem of Grotius, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the unfortunate &s;on of the Pre&s;ident De

He received, indeed, the mo&s;t flattering marks of regard from many eminent characters of that kingdom, and a pen&s;ion of three thou&s;and livres from Lewis the XIIIth; but the payment of this gratuity, &s;o honourable to the Monarch who be&s;towed it, was &s;oon rendered irregular and pre|carious by the artifices of Richelieu; and Gro|tius

was at length obliged to &s;eek a more inde|pendent a&s;ylum, merely becau&s;e he was of too firm and noble a character to become the &s;ervile in&s;trument of that imperious mini&s;ter.&mdash;He had pa&s;&s;ed however ten years, and compo&s;ed one of his mo&s;t celebrated works in that country&mdash;his Treati&s;e de Jure Belli &amp; Pacis was begun in 1623 at Balagui, a &s;eat of the Pre&s;ident De Meme, in the neighbourhood of Senlis, and he publi&s;hed it at Paris in 1625.

The death of his enemy Prince Maurice had tempted Grotius to hope, that he might return with &s;afety and honour to his native country; but on making the experiment in 1631, he met with much more ingratitude than he expected, and retired in the next year to Hamburgh&mdash;he there contracted an intimacy with Salvius, the Vice-Chancellor of Sweden, who &s;ent a favour|able

Grotius was &s;oon invited to Franckfort by that penetrating genius, who introduced him into the council of the young Chri&s;tina, and appointed him her Am|ba&s;&s;ador to the court of France:&mdash;it is &s;aid, how|ever, that Grotius owed his connection with Sweden to the high &s;entiments which Gu&s;tavus him&s;elf had entertained of his merit, and to or|ders given by that Monarch for the employment of the celebrated exile, who&s;e Treati&s;e de Jure Belli was found in his tent after the fatal victory of Lutzen, which he purcha&s;ed with his life. However this may be, Grotius appeared at Paris in the character of Amba&s;&s;ador from Sweden 1635, and continued no le&s;s than ten years in a &s;ituation equally &s;plendid and vexatious&mdash;en|gaged in the delicate bu&s;ine&s;s of negotiating &s;ub|&s;idies, which were paid with reluctance; har|ra&s;&s;ed by the ho&s;tile intrigues of his ungrateful

country, and alternately in&s;ulted and flattered by the mini&s;ters of France, he maintained him&s;elf with integrity and honour in a difficult and im|portant &s;tation, from which his various and pow|erful enemies were perpetually endeavouring to effect his removal.&mdash;After a &s;eries of public mor|tifications, he at length &s;olicited his own recall. He obtained a pa&s;&s;port through Holland, was treated with great honour at Am&s;terdam, and ar|riving at Stockholm was flattered with great pro|mi&s;es by the Queen Chri&s;tina, who pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;ettle with his family in Sweden. From this however he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, and pleaded the ten|der health of his wife as unequal to &s;o cold a climate. Having obtained, after &s;ome delays, the Queen's permi&s;&s;ion to retire, and a ve&s;&s;el to carry him to Lubeck, he was unfortunately &s;hip|wrecked on the coa&s;t of Pomerania, from whence he travelled &s;ixty miles in an open waggon, to the town of Ro&s;tock, where, after langui&s;hing a few days, he expired on the 19th of Augu&s;t 1645.&mdash;

For my very imperfect account of this great and amiable man, I am chiefly indebted to Mr. Bu|rigny, who&s;e life of Grotius de&s;erves a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed rank among biographical writings, as it contains a very luminous di&s;play of much intri|cate matter, and a ju&s;t delineation of a character which de&s;erves to be minutely &s;tudied: for what nation can produce a more &s;ingular and excelling compound of &s;cience and virtue, of genius and piety?&mdash;As an Hi&s;torian, he &s;hares with Thu|cydides the uncommon merit of celebrating the &s;plendid actions of his per&s;onal enemies, and of a country which treated him with the mo&s;t unge|nerous ingratitude. It appears from one of his letters to De Thou, that he had made &s;ome ad|vances in the plan at lea&s;t of his Hi&s;tory, at &s;o early a period as 1614; for, after complimenting the great Hi&s;torian of France on his immortal work, he adds, <Q REND="inline">Ego quoque impar &s;an&egrave; oneri, &s;ed magno patriae amore accen&s;us, &s;imile opus molior; tant&ograve; autem minus tuo, quant&ograve; minor e&s;t Batavia, non dicam Galli&acirc; ve&s;tr&acirc;, &s;ed toto orbe.

<L><HI>The liberal &s;pirit of Thuanus ro&s;e.</HI>]</L>
<P>James Au|gu&s;tus De Thou was the younge&s;t &s;on of Chri&s;to|pher De Thou, Fir&s;t Pre&s;ident of the Parliament of Paris, and born in that city 1553. His own Memoirs give a plea&s;ing account of the early activity of his mind.&mdash;As his health, dur|ing his childhood, was &s;o tender and infirm, that his parents rather re&s;trained him from the u&s;ual &s;tudies of his age, he devoted much of his time to drawing, and copied with a pen the engrav|ings
<PB N="223" REF="223">
of Albert Durer, before he was ten years old. At that age, he was &s;ettled in the college of Burgundy; but this plan of his education was &s;oon interrupted by a fever, in which his life was de&s;paired of, and in which the mother of his fu|ture friend, the Duke of Montpen&s;ier, watched him with an attention &s;ingularly happy, after his phy&s;icians and his parents had con&s;idered him as dead. In a few years after his recovery, he re|paired to Orleans to &s;tudy the civil law; from thence he was drawn to Valence in Dauphiny, by the reputation of Cujacius, who was then reading lectures there: on his road he embraced an opportunity of hearing Hotoman, the cele|brated author of Franco-Gallia, who was read|ing lectures al&s;o at Bourges.&mdash;During his re&s;idence at Valence, he contracted a friend|&s;hip with Jo&s;eph Scaliger, which he cultivated through life.&mdash;In 1572, his father recalled him to Paris, ju&s;t before the ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bar|tholomew.&mdash;He mentions in his Memoirs the horrors which he felt in &s;eeing a very &s;mall part
<PB N="224" REF="224">
of that bloody &s;cene.&mdash;He re&s;ided in the hou&s;e of his uncle Nicholas De Thou, promoted to the bi&s;hopric of Chartres: he was then de&s;igned him&s;elf for the church; and, beginning to collect his celebrated library, applied him&s;elf particu|larly to the Civil Law, and to Grecian litera|ture.</P>
<P>He travelled into Italy in 1573, with Paul De Foix, going on an emba&s;&s;y to the Pope and the Italian Princes. Of De Foix he gives the mo&s;t engaging character, and &s;peaks with great plea|&s;ure of the literary entertainment and advantages which he derived from this expedition. He return|ed to Paris, and devoted him&s;elf again to his &s;tu|dies, in the following year.&mdash;On the di&s;&s;entions in the court of France, in 1576, he was employed to negociate with the Mare&s;chal Montmorency, and engage him to interpo&s;e his good offices to prevent the civil war; which he for &s;ome time ef|fected.&mdash;The &s;ame year he vi&s;ited the Low Countries, and on his return was appointed to a public office; on which he entered with that ex|treme
<PB N="225" REF="225">
diffidence which is &s;o natural to a delicate mind.</P>
<P>In 1579 he travelled again with his elder bro|ther, who was &s;ent by his phy&s;icians to the baths of Plombieres in Lorrain: from hence he made a &s;hort excur&s;ion into Germany, and was received there with the jovial ho&s;pitality of that country, which he de&s;cribes in a very lively manner.&mdash;But affection &s;oon recalled him to Plombieres, to at|tend his infirm brother to Paris, who died there in a few months after their return.</P>
<P>In 1580, on the plague's appearing in the ca|pital, our Hi&s;torian retired into Touraine; and after vi&s;iting the principal places in Nor|mandy, returned to Paris in the winter. In the following year, he was of the number cho&s;en from the Parliament of Paris to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice in Guienne, as two eccle&s;ia&s;tics were included in that commi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;In this expedition he embraced every opportunity of preparing the materials of his Hi&s;tory; &s;eeking, as he ever did, the &s;ociety of all per&s;ons eminent for their talents, or capable of giv|ing
<PB N="226" REF="226">
him any u&s;eful information. He &s;peaks with great plea&s;ure of a vi&s;it which he paid at this time to the celebrated Montaigne, whom he calls a man of a mo&s;t liberal mind, and totally uninfected with the &s;pirit of party.&mdash;After various excur&s;ions he was now returning to Paris, when he recei|ved the unexpected news of his father's death; an event which affected him mo&s;t deeply, as filial affection was one of the &s;triking characteri&s;tics of his amiable mind. He con&s;oled him&s;elf under the affliction of having been unable to pay his duty to his dying parent, by erecting a magnificent mo|nument to his memory, expre&s;&s;ive of the high ve|neration in which he ever held his virtues.&mdash;He engaged again in public bu&s;ine&s;s, devoting his in|tervals of lei&s;ure to mathematical &s;tudies, and to the compo&s;ition of Latin ver&s;e, which &s;eems to have been his favourite amu&s;ement.&mdash;In 1584 he pub|li&s;hed his Poem, De Re Accipitraria; which, tho' much celebrated by the critics of his age, has fallen, like the &s;ubject of which it treats, into univer&s;al neglect.&mdash;In 1585 he bid adieu to the
<PB N="227" REF="227">
Court, on finding him&s;elf treated with &s;uch a de|gree of coldne&s;s, as his ingenuous nature could not &s;ubmit to; and being eager to advance in his great work, which he had already brought down to the reign of Francis II.&mdash;In 1587, having been often pre&s;&s;ed to marry by his family, and being ab&s;olved from his eccle&s;ia&s;tical engagements for that pur|po&s;e, he made choice of Marie Barban&s;on, of an antient and noble family; but as her parents were &s;u&s;pected of a &s;ecret inclination to the re|formed religion, it was thought proper that the lady &s;hould undergo a kind of expiation, in a private conference with two Catholic Divines; a circum&s;tance of which the great Hi&s;torian &s;peaks with an air of triumph in his Memoirs, as a proof of his own inviolable attachment to the faith of his fathers. In 1588 he lo&s;t his affectionate mother; who is de&s;cribed, by her &s;on, as meeting death with the &s;ame gentlene&s;s and tranquillity of mind, by which her life was di&s;tingui&s;hed.&mdash;When the violence of the League had reduced Henry the IIId to abandon Paris, our Hi&s;torian was &s;ent into Nor|mandy,
<PB N="228" REF="228">
to confirm the magi&s;trates of that province in their adherence to the King. He afterwards met Henry at Blois; and while he was receiving from him in private &s;ome commi&s;&s;ions to execute at Paris, the King pre&s;&s;ed his hand, and &s;eemed preparing to impart to him &s;ome important &s;ecret; but after a long pau&s;e di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him without re|vealing it. This &s;ecret was afterwards &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the projected a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the Duke of Gui&s;e: the &s;uppo&s;ition is probable; and it is al&s;o probable that if Henry had then revealed his de&s;ign, the manly virtue and eloquence of De Thou might have led him to relinqui&s;h that infa|mous and fatal mea&s;ure.&mdash;He was, however, &s;o far from &s;u&s;pecting the intended crime of the King, that when he fir&s;t heard at Paris that Gui&s;e was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, he believed it a fal&s;e rumour, only &s;pread by that faction to introduce, what he &s;up|po&s;ed had really happened, the murder of the King.&mdash;In the commotions which the death of Gui&s;e produced in Paris, many in&s;ults were offered to the family of De Thou: his wife was impri&s;oned
<PB N="229" REF="229">
for a day in the Ba&s;tile; but obtaining her liberty, &s;he e&s;caped from the city in a mean habit, atten|ded by her hu&s;band, di&s;gui&s;ed al&s;o in the dre&s;s of a &s;oldier.&mdash;Having &s;ent his wife in &s;afety into Pi|cardy, he repaired to the King, who was almo&s;t de&s;erted, at Blois; and was greatly in&s;trumental in per&s;uading his ma&s;ter to his coalition with Henry of Navarre.&mdash;The King determined to e&s;tabli&s;h a Parliament at Tours, and De Thou was con&s;idered as the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to be the Pre&s;ident of this a&s;&s;embly; but with his u&s;ual mode&s;ty he declined this honour, and cho&s;e rather to engage with his friend Mr. de Schomberg, in an expedition to Germany for the &s;ervice of the King.&mdash;He was at fir&s;t de&s;igned for the emba&s;&s;y to Elizabeth; but at the reque&s;t of Schomberg declined the appointment, and accompanied his friend.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t received intelligence of the King's death at Venice, where he had formed an intima|cy with the celebrated Arnauld d'O&s;&s;at, at that time Secretary to the Cardinal Joyeu&s;e.&mdash;In con|&s;equence
<PB N="230" REF="230">
of their conver&s;ation on this event, and the calamities of France, De Thou addre&s;&s;ed a Latin Poem to his friend, which he afterwards printed at Tours.</P>
<P>In leaving Italy, he pa&s;&s;ed a few days at Padua with his friend Vicenzio Pinelli; from whom he collected many particulars concerning the mo&s;t eminent Italian and Spani&s;h Authors, whom he determined to celebrate in his Hi&s;tory; in the hope, as he hone&s;tly confe&s;&s;es, that his liberal at|tention to foreign merit might entitle his own Works to the favour both of Italy and Spain. But he was di&s;appointed in this fair expectation, and laments the ingratitude which he experienced from both.</P>
<P>On his return to France, he was graciou&s;ly received by Henry the IVth; and in giving that Prince an account of Italy, &s;ugge&s;ted to him the idea of a connection with Mary of Medicis. After the battle of Ivry, he complimented the King in a &s;hort Poem, which clo&s;es with the following lines:<Q><PB N="231" REF="231">
<L>Au&s;piciis vulg&ograve; peraguntur praelia regum,</L>
<L>Perque duces illis gloria multa venit:</L>
<L>Tu vincis virtute tua, nec militis haec e&s;t;</L>
<L>I&s;ta tibi propri&acirc; laurea parta manu.</L></Q> As he was travelling, &s;oon afterwards, with his wife and family, which he de&s;igned to &s;ettle at Tours, his party was intercepted by the enemy, and he was obliged to abandon his wife and her attendants; being prevailed on by their entrea|ties to &s;ecure his own e&s;cape by the &s;wiftne&s;s of his hor&s;e.&mdash;He repaired to the King at Gi&s;ors, and &s;oon obtained the re&s;titution of his family.&mdash;On the death of Amyot, Bi&s;hop of Auxerre, well known by his various Tran&s;lations from the Greek language, the King appointed De Thou his Principal Librarian. In 1592, our Hi&s;torian was very near falling a victim to the plague; but happily &s;truggled through that dangerous di&s;tem|per, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two &s;kilful phy&s;icians, who attended him at Tours.&mdash;In 1593, he began the mo&s;t important part of his Hi&s;tory; and under this year he introduces in his Memoirs a long and &s;pi|rited
<PB N="232" REF="232">
Poem, addre&s;&s;ed to Po&s;terity; in which he enters into a ju&s;tification of him&s;elf again&s;t the malignant attacks which the manly and vir|tuous freedom of his writings had drawn upon him. It concludes with the following animated appeal to the &s;pirit of his father:<Q><L>Vos, O majorum Cineres, teque optime longis</L>
<L>Soliciti genitor defuncte laboribus aevi,</L>
<L>Te&s;tor, pro patria nullas regnique &s;alute</L>
<L>Vitavi&s;&s;e vices; ve&s;tra virtute meaque</L>
<L>Indignum nil feci&s;&s;e; et &s;i fata tuli&s;&s;ent,</L>
<L>Prode&s;&s;em ut patriae, patriae &s;uccurrere, livor</L>
<L>Ab&s;i&s;tat, pietate mea merui&s;&s;e petenti.</L>
<L>Pura ad vos anima atque hodiernae ne&s;cia culpae</L>
<L>De&s;cendam; quand&ograve;que novi&s;&s;ima venerit hora,</L>
<L>No&s;traque &s;ub tacitos ibit fama integra manes.</L></Q></P>
<P>In 1594 he &s;ucceeded his uncle Augu&s;tin, as Pre&s;ident a Mortier.&mdash;In 1596 he lo&s;t his valu|able and learned friend Pithou, who fir&s;t &s;olicited him to undertake his Hi&s;tory, and had greatly
<PB N="233" REF="233">
a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in the pro&s;ecution of that laborious work. How deeply the affectionate mind of De Thou was wounded by this event, appears from his long letter to Ca&s;aubon on the occa&s;ion.&mdash;In 1597 he began to be engaged in tho&s;e negotia|tions, which happily terminated in the famous edict of Nantes.&mdash;It may be proper to ob&s;erve here, that De Thou was accu&s;ed of being a Cal|vini&s;t, in con&s;equence of the part he acted in this bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as from the moderate tenor of his Hi&s;tory; and it is remarkable, that Sully &s;eems in his Memoirs to countenance the accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>In 1601 our Hi&s;torian &s;uffered a &s;evere do|me&s;tic affliction in the lo&s;s of his wife. He cele|brated her virtues, and his own connubial affec|tion, in a Latin Poem: with this, and a Greek epitaph on the &s;ame lady, written by Ca&s;aubon, he terminates the Commentary of his own Life, of which the preceding account is an imperfect abridgment.&mdash;His fir&s;t wife leaving him no children, he married, in 1603, Ga&s;parde de la Cha&s;tre, an accompli&s;hed lady of a noble family;
<PB N="234" REF="234">
who having brought him three &s;ons and three daughters, died at the age of 39, 1616.&mdash;There is a fine letter of Daniel Hein&s;ius addre&s;&s;ed to our author on this occa&s;ion, exhorting him to fortitude: but this unexpected dome&s;tic calamity, and the mi&s;eries which befel his country on the murder of Henry the Great, are &s;aid to have wounded his feeling mind &s;o deeply, as to occa|&s;ion his death, which happened in May 1617.&mdash;Under the regency of Mary of Medicis, he had been one of the Directors General of the finances; maintaining the &s;ame reputation for integrity in that department, which he had ever pre&s;erved in his judicial capacity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of his Hi&s;tory appeared in 1604, with a Preface addre&s;&s;ed to Henry IV. ju&s;tly ce|lebrated for its liberal and manly &s;pirit. But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the following compliment to the King&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Quicquid de ea &s;tatueris ju&s;&s;eri&s;ve, pro divinae vocis oraeulo mihi erit</Q>&mdash;was more than even that mo&s;t amiable of Monarchs de&s;erved; as he ungratefully de&s;erted the cau&s;e of our Hi&s;to|rian,
<PB N="235" REF="235">
in &s;uffering his Work to be pro&s;cribed by the public cen&s;ure of Rome, in 1609; as De Thou plainly intimates in the following pa&s;&s;age from one of his letters, written in 1611:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Pub|licata prima parte [Hi&s;toriae meae], imman&egrave; quam commoti &s;unt plerique, &s;ive invidi, &s;ive factio&s;i, qui mox proceres quo&s;dam, qui per &s;e in talibus rebus nihil vident, per calumnias artificios&egrave; con|fictas, ut &s;cis, in me concitaverunt, remque e ve&s;tigio Roman detulerunt; et auctore malign&egrave; exagitato, facil&egrave; pervicerunt, ut moro&s;i illi cen|&s;ores omnia mea &s;ini&s;tr&egrave; interpretarentur; et, praejudicio per&s;onae, opus integrum, cujus ne tertiam quidem partem legerant, praecipitato ordine damnarent.

to the re&s;entment which Cardinal Richelieu is &s;aid to have conceived again&s;t him, from a pa&s;&s;age in the great Hi&s;torian reflecting on the Richelieu family.

<P>I wi&s;h not to dwell invidiou&s;ly on the failings of this immortal Genius; but it may be u&s;eful to remark, that no Hi&s;torical work, though executed by a man of the highe&s;t mental abilities, can obtain a la&s;ting reputation, if it be planned and written with a &s;ervility of &s;pirit.&mdash;This was evidently the ca&s;e in Bacon's Hi&s;tory of Henry the VIIth.
<PB N="247" REF="247">
It was the fir&s;t work he engaged in after his di&s;grace, and laid as a peace-offering at the feet of his ma&s;ter, the de&s;picable James; who affected to con&s;ider his great grandfather, the abject and avaricious Henry, as the model of a King. It was therefore the aim of the unfortunate Hi&s;torian to flatter this phanta&s;y of the royal pedant, for whom he wrote; and he accordingly formed a colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue to repre&s;ent a pigmy.&mdash;It is matter of a&s;toni&s;hment that Lord Bolingbroke, who in his political works has written on the vices of this very King, with a force and beauty &s;o &s;uperior to the Hi&s;tory in que&s;tion, &s;hould &s;peak of it as a work po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing merit &s;ufficient to bear a compari&s;on with the ancients. On the contrary, the extreme awkwardne&s;s of the ta&s;k which the Hi&s;torian impo&s;ed upon him&s;elf, gave a weakne&s;s and embarra&s;&s;ment to his &s;tyle, which in his nobler works is clear, nervous, and manly. This will particularly appear from a few lines in his character of Henry:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"This King, to &s;peak of him in terms equal to his de&s;erving, was

Indeed Dedications in general are but too com|monly a di&s;grace to letters.&mdash;Perhaps a conci&s;e Hi&s;tory of this &s;pecies of writing, and the fate of &s;ome remarkable Dedicators, might have a good influence towards correcting that pro&s;titution of talents, which is &s;o often ob&s;erved in productions of this nature: and &s;uch a work might be very amu&s;ing to the lovers of literary anecdote.&mdash;The two mo&s;t unfortunate Dedications that occur to my remembrance, were written by Jo&s;hua Barnes, and Dr. Pearce, late Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;|ter: The fir&s;t dedicated his Hi&s;tory of Edward the IIId to James the IId, and unluckily com|pared that Monarch to the mo&s;t valiant of his predece&s;&s;ors, ju&s;t before his timidity led him to abdicate the throne: the &s;econd dedicated his edition of Tully de Oratore to Lord Macclesfield, and as unluckily celebrated his patron as a model of public virtue, not many years before he was impeached in parliament, and fined &pound;.30,000, for the iniquity of his conduct in the office of Chancellor.</P>

As this in&s;olent and dogmatical Author has gro&s;sly in&s;ulted our country, by vili|fying our mo&s;t eminent writers of Hi&s;tory, I had thoughts of cha&s;ti&s;ing his pre&s;umption by a full di&s;play of his various ab&s;urdities; but as this unplea&s;ant office has been in &s;ome mea&s;ure per|formed by one of his own countrymen, under the title of a Supplement to his Work, I &s;hall only make a few remarks on the illiberal terms in which he &s;peaks of my friend Mr. Gibbon.</P>

In the blindne&s;s and precipitancy that u&s;ually belong to ba&s;e anger, he attributes the defect of dullne&s;s to a Book, more univer&s;ally read than any modern performance of equal magnitude.</P>
<P>The Abb&eacute; talks loudly of the literary virtues that become an Hi&s;torian: but he &s;eems to have forgot that there are literary vices, which may render even a learned and ingenious critic con|temptible. No productions of the pre&s;s are more di&s;graceful to literature, than tho&s;e in which a di&s;&s;ertation on any art is made the vehicle of per&s;onal malignity: yet, as this is the mo&s;t plau&s;ible and in&s;inuating method of giving vent to malice, it is, perhaps, the mo&s;t common. In the end, however, this &s;pecies of

literary &s;lander defeats its own purpo&s;e; for, if the envious are plea&s;ed to echo it for a time, to more candid and generous readers it endears the merit it traduces. They lament the hard de&s;tiny of &s;uperior talents; and recollect, with a &s;igh of affectionate indignation, the ju&s;t and &s;pirited remark of Mon&s;ieur D' Alembert, <Q REND="inline">"Que les grands Genies &s;ont toujours de chir&eacute;s par des gens, qui ne &s;ont pas dignes de les lire!"</Q></P>
