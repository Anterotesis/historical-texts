<HEAD>Principles and Progre&s;s of MORALITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;cience of morals, like other &s;ciences, is in a very imperfect &s;tate among &s;avages; and arrives at maturity among enlightened nations by very &s;low degrees. This progre&s;s points out the hi&s;torical part, as fir&s;t in order: but as that hi&s;tory would give little &s;atisfaction, without a rule for comparing the morals of different ages, and of different nations, I begin with the prin|ciples of morality, &s;uch as ought to govern at all times, and in all nations. The pre&s;ent &s;ketch ac|cordingly is divided into two parts. In the fir&s;t, the principles are unfolded; and the &s;econd is al|together hi&s;torical.</P>

<HEAD>HUMAN ACTIONS analy&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>THE hand of God is no where more vi&s;ible, than in the nice adju&s;tment of our internal frame to our &s;ituation in this world. An animal is endued with a power of &s;elf-motion; and in performing animal functions, requires not any external aid. This more e&s;pecially is the ca&s;e of man, the noble&s;t of terre&s;trial beings. His heart beats, his blood circulates, his &s;tomach dige&s;ts, evacuations proceed, &amp;c. &amp;c. By what means? Not &s;urely by the laws of mechani&s;m, which are far from being adequate to &s;uch operations. The operations mentioned are effects of an inter|nal power, be&s;towed on man for pre&s;erving life.
<PB N="3" REF="7">
The power is exerted uniformly, and without in|terruption, independent of will, and without con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Man is a being &s;u&s;ceptible of plea&s;ure and pain: the&s;e generate de&s;ire to attain what is agreeable, and to &s;hun what is di&s;agreeable; and he is enabled by other powers to gratify his de&s;ires. One power, termed <HI>in&s;tinct,</HI> is exerted indeed with con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; but blindly, with|out will, and without intention to produce any effect. Brute animals act for the mo&s;t part by in&s;tinct: hunger prompts them to eat, and cold, to take &s;helter; knowingly indeed, but with|out exerting any act of will, and without fore|&s;ight of what will happen. Infants of the hu|man &s;pecies, little &s;uperior to brutes, are, like brutes, governed by in&s;tinct: they lay hold of the nipple, without knowing that &s;ucking will &s;atisfy their hunger; and they weep when pain|ed, without any view of relief<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Akin to the&s;e, are certain habitual acts done without thought, &s;uch as &s;nuffing or grinning. Cu&s;tom enables one to move the fingers on an in&s;trument of mu&s;ic, without being directed by will: the motion is often too quick for an act of will. Some arrive at great perfection in the art of balancing: the &s;lighte&s;t deviation from the ju&s;t balance is in&s;tantly redre&s;&s;ed: were a preceding act of will nece&s;&s;ary, it would be too late. An un|expected hollow in walking, occa&s;ions a violent &s;hock: is not this evidence, that external motion is governed by the mind, frequently without con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s; and that in walking, the body is adju&s;ted be|fore-hand to what is expected?</NOTE>. Another power is governed by intention and will. In the progre&s;s from infancy to maturity, the mind opens to objects, without end, of de&s;ire and of
<PB N="4" REF="8">
aver&s;ion, the attaining or &s;hunning of which depend more or le&s;s on our own will. We are placed in a wide world, left to our own conduct; and we are by nature provided with a proper power for performing what we intend and will. The actions we perform by this power are term|ed <HI>voluntary.</HI> There &s;till remain another &s;pecies of actions, termed <HI>involuntary;</HI> as where we act by &s;ome irre&s;i&s;tible motive again&s;t our will. An action may be voluntary, though done with re|luctance; as where a man, to free him&s;elf from torture, reveals the &s;ecrets of his friend: his confe&s;&s;ion is voluntary, though drawn from him with great reluctance. But let us &s;uppo&s;e, that after the firme&s;t re&s;olution to reveal nothing, his mind is unhinged by exqui&s;ite torture; the di&s;co|very he makes may be ju&s;tly termed <HI>involuntary:</HI> he &s;peaks indeed; but he is compelled to it ab&s;o|lutely again&s;t his will.</P>
<P>Man is by his nature an accountable being, an|&s;werable for his conduct to God and man. In doing any action that wears a double face, he is prompted by his nature to explain the &s;ame to his relations, his friends, his acquaintance; and above all, to tho&s;e who have authority over him. He hopes for prai&s;e for every right action, and dreads blame for every one that is wrong. But for what &s;ort of actions does he hold him&s;elf ac|countable? Not &s;urely for an in&s;tinctive action, which is done blindly, without intention, and without will: neither for an involuntary action, becau&s;e it is extorted from him again&s;t his will: and lea&s;t of all, for actions done without con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s, &s;uch as tho&s;e which pre&s;erve life. What only remain are voluntary actions, which are either right or wrong. Such actions are done wittingly and willingly: for the&s;e we mu&s;t an|&s;wer,
<PB N="5" REF="9">
if at all accountable; and for the&s;e every man in con&s;cience holds him&s;elf bound to an|&s;wer.</P>
<P>And now more particularly upon voluntary actions. To intend and to will, though com|monly held &s;ynonymous, &s;ignify different acts of the mind. Intention re&s;pects the effect: Will re&s;pects the action that is exerted for pro|ducing the effect. It is my intention, for ex|ample, to relieve my friend from di&s;tre&s;s: upon &s;eeing him, it is my will to give him a &s;um for his relief: the external act of giving fol|lows; and my friend is relieved, which is the effect intended. But the&s;e internal acts, though in their nature different, are always united: I cannot will the means, without intending the effect; and I cannot intend the effect, without willing the means<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To incline, to re&s;olve, to intend, to will, are acts of the mind relative to external action. The&s;e &s;everal acts are well under&s;tood; though they cannot be de|fined, being perfectly &s;imple.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some effects of voluntary action follow nece&s;|&s;arily: A wound is an effect that nece&s;&s;arily fol|lows the &s;tabbing a per&s;on with a dagger: death is a nece&s;&s;ary effect of throwing one down from the battlements of a high tower. Some effects are probable only: I labour in order to provide for my family; fight for my country to re&s;cue it from oppre&s;&s;ors; take phy&s;ic for my health. In &s;uch ca&s;es, the event intended does not nece&s;&s;arily nor always follow.</P>
<P>A man, when he wills to act, mu&s;t intend the nece&s;&s;ary effect: a per&s;on who &s;tabs, cer|tainly intends to wound. But where the effect
<PB N="6" REF="10">
is probable only, a man may act without in|tending the effect that follows: a &s;tone thrown by me at random into the market-place, may happen to wound a man without my intending it. One acts by in&s;tinct, without either will or intention: voluntary actions that nece&s;&s;arily produce their effect, imply intention: voluntary actions, when the effect is probable only, are &s;ometimes intended, &s;ometimes not.</P>
<P>Human actions are di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by certain <HI>qualities,</HI> termed <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong.</HI> But as the&s;e make the corner-&s;tone of morality, they are re&s;erved to the following &s;ection.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Divi&s;ion of Human Actions into RIGHT, WRONG, and INDIFFERENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE qualities of right and wrong in voluntary actions, are univer&s;ally acknowledged as the foundation of morality; and yet philo&s;ophers have been &s;trangely perplexed about them. The hi&s;tory of their various opinions, would &s;ignify little but to darken the &s;ubject: the reader will have more &s;atisfaction in &s;eeing the&s;e qualities ex|plained, without entering at all into controver&s;y.</P>
<P>No per&s;on is ignorant of primary and &s;econdary qualities, a di&s;tinction much in&s;i&s;ted on by philo|&s;ophers. Primary qualities, &s;uch as figure, co|he&s;ion, weight, are permanent qualities, that ex|i&s;t in a &s;ubject whether perceived or not. Secon|dary qualities, &s;uch as colour, ta&s;te, &s;mell, de|pend on the percipient as much as on the &s;ubject, being nothing when not perceived. Beauty and ugline&s;s are qualities of the latter &s;ort: they have no exi&s;tence but when perceived; and, like all other &s;econdary qualities, they are perceived in|tuitively; having no dependence on rea&s;on nor
<PB N="8" REF="12">
on judgment, more than colour has, or &s;mell, or ta&s;te<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, vol. 1. p. 207. edit. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The qualities of right and wrong in voluntary actions, are &s;econdary, like beauty and ugline&s;s, and the other &s;econdary qualities mentioned. Like them, they are objects of intuitive percep|tion, and depend not in any degree on rea&s;on or on judgment. No argument is requi&s;ite to prove, that to re&s;cue an innocent babe from the jaws of a wolf, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, are right actions: they are perceived to be &s;o intuitively. As little is an argument requi|&s;ite to prove, that murder, deceit, perjury, are wrong actions: they are perceived intuitive|ly to be &s;o. The Deity has be&s;towed on man, different faculties for different purpo&s;es. Truth and fal&s;ehood are inve&s;tigated by the rea&s;oning fa|culty. Beauty and ugline&s;s are objects of a &s;en&s;e, known by the name of <HI>ta&s;te.</HI> Right and wrong are objects of a &s;en&s;e termed the <HI>moral &s;en&s;e</HI> or <HI>con&s;cience.</HI> And &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e qualities to be hid from our perception, in vain would we try to di&s;cover them by any argument, or proce&s;s of rea&s;oning: the attempt would be ab&s;urd; no le&s;s &s;o than an attempt to di&s;cover colour, by rea&s;on|ing, or ta&s;te, or &s;mell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Every perception mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome facul|ty or power of perception, termed <HI>&s;en&s;e.</HI> The moral &s;en&s;e, by which we perceive the qualities of right and wrong, may be con&s;idered either as a branch of the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, by which we perceive the actions to which the&s;e qualities belong, or as a &s;en&s;e di&s;tinct from all others. The &s;en&s;es by which objects are perceived, are not &s;eparated from each other by di&s;tinct bounda|ries; and the &s;orting or cla&s;&s;ing them, &s;eems to depend more on ta&s;te and fancy, than on nature. I have fol|lowed the plan laid down by former writers; which is, to con&s;ider the moral &s;en&s;e as a &s;en&s;e di&s;tinct from o|thers, becau&s;e it is the ea&s;ie&s;t and cleare&s;t manner of conceiving it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="13">
Right and wrong, as mentioned above, are qualities of voluntary actions, and of no other kind. An in&s;tinctive action is beneficial, is agreeable: but it cannot properly be denominated either right or wrong. An involuntary act is hurtful to the agent, and di&s;agreeable to the &s;pec|tator; but in the agent it is neither right nor wrong. The&s;e qualities al&s;o depend in no de|gree on the event. Thus, if, to &s;ave my friend from drowning, I plunge into a river, the action is right, though I happen to come too late. And if I aim a &s;troke at a man behind his back, the action is wrong, though I happen not to touch him.</P>
<P>The qualities of right and of agreeable, are in|&s;eparable; and &s;o are the qualities of wrong and of di&s;agreeable. A right action, accordingly, is agreeable, not only in the direct perception, but equally &s;o in every &s;ub&s;equent recollection. And in both circum&s;tances equally, a wrong action is di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Right actions are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the moral &s;en&s;e into two kinds, viz. what <HI>ought</HI> to be done, and what <HI>may</HI> be done, or left undone. Wrong actions admit not that di&s;tinction: they are all prohibited to be done. To &s;ay that an action ought to be done, means that we are tied or obliged to perform; and to &s;ay that an action ought not to be done, means that we are re&s;train|ed from doing it. Though the nece&s;&s;ity implied in the being tied or obliged, is not phy&s;ical, but
<PB N="10" REF="14">
only what is commonly termed <HI>moral;</HI> yet we conceive our&s;elves deprived of liberty or freedom, and nece&s;&s;arily bound to act or to forbear acting, in oppo&s;ition to every other motive. The nece&s;|&s;ity here de&s;cribed is termed <HI>duty.</HI> The moral nece&s;&s;ity we are under to forbear harming the in|nocent, is a proper example: the moral &s;en&s;e de|clares the re&s;traint to be our duty, which no mo|tive whatever will excu&s;e us for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The duty of performing or forbearing any ac|tion, implies a <HI>right</HI> in &s;ome per&s;on to exact per|formance of that duty; and accordingly, a duty or obligation nece&s;&s;arily infers a corre&s;ponding right. A promi&s;e on my part to pay L. 100, confers a right to demand performance. The man who commits an injury, violates the <HI>right</HI> of the per&s;on injured, which entitles him to demand reparation of the wrong.</P>
<P>Duty is twofold; duty to others, and duty to our&s;elves. With re&s;pect to the former, the doing what we ought to do, is termed <HI>ju&s;t:</HI> the doing what we ought not to do, and the omitting what we ought to do, are termed <HI>unju&s;t.</HI> With re&s;pect to our&s;elves, the doing what we ought to do, is termed <HI>proper:</HI> the doing what we ought not to do, and the omitting what we ought to do, are termed <HI>improper.</HI> Thus, <HI>right,</HI> &s;ignifying a quality of certain actions, is a genus; of which <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> are &s;pecies: <HI>wrong,</HI> &s;ignifying a quality of other actions, is a genus; of which <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>improper</HI> are &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Right actions left to our free will, to be done, or left undone, come next in order. They are, like the former, right when done; but they dif|fer, in not being wrong when left undone. To remit a ju&s;t debt for the &s;ake of a growing family, to yield a &s;ubject in controver&s;y rather than go to law with a neighbour, generou&s;ly to return
<PB N="11" REF="15">
good for ill, are examples of this &s;pecies. They are univer&s;ally approved as right actions: but as no per&s;on has a right or title to obligue us to per|form &s;uch actions, the leaving them undone is not a wrong: no per&s;on is injured by the forbearance. Actions that come under this cla&s;s, &s;hall be termed <HI>arbitrary,</HI> for want of a more proper de&s;ignation.</P>
<P>So much for right actions, and their divi&s;ions. Wrong actions are of two kinds, <HI>criminal</HI> and <HI>cul|pable.</HI> What are done intentionally to produce mi&s;chief, are criminal: &s;uch ra&s;h or unguarded actions as produce mi&s;chief without intention, are culpable. The former are re&s;trained by pu|ni&s;hment, to be handled in the 5th &s;ection; the latter by reparation, to be handled in the 6th.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ions of voluntary actions are not yet exhau&s;ted. Some there are that, properly &s;peak|ing, cannot be denominated either right or wrong. Actions done merely for amu&s;ement or pa&s;time, without intention to produce good or ill, are of that kind; leaping, for example, running, jumping over a &s;tick, throwing a &s;tone to make circles in the water. Such actions are neither approved nor di&s;approved: they may be termed <HI>indifferent.</HI></P>
<P>There is no cau&s;e for doubting the exi&s;tence of the moral &s;en&s;e, more than for doubting the ex|i&s;tence of the &s;en&s;e of beauty, of &s;eeing, or of hearing. In fact, the perception of right and wrong as qualities of actions, is no le&s;s di&s;tinct and clear, than that of beauty, of colour, or of any other quality; and as every perception is an act of &s;en&s;e, the &s;en&s;e of beauty is not with grea|ter certainty evinced from the perception of beau|ty, than the moral &s;en&s;e is from the perception of right and wrong. We find this &s;en&s;e di&s;tributed among individuals in different degrees of perfec|tion: but there perhaps never exi&s;ted any one
<PB N="12" REF="16">
above the condition of an idiot, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it not in &s;ome degree; and were any man intirely de&s;titute of it, the terms <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> would be to him no le&s;s unintelligible, than the term colour is to one born blind.</P>
<P>That every individual is endued with a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, more or le&s;s di&s;tinct, will pro|bably be granted; but whether there be among men what may be termed a <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> of right and wrong, producing uniformity of opinion as to right and wrong, is not &s;o evident. There is no ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing the opinions of men about right and wrong, to be as various as about beauty and deformity: and that this &s;uppo&s;ition is not de&s;titute of foundation, we are led to &s;u&s;|pect, upon di&s;covering that in different countries, and even in the &s;ame country at different times, the opinions publicly e&s;pou&s;ed with regard to right and wrong, are extremely various; that among &s;ome nations it was held lawful for a man to &s;ell his children for &s;laves, and in their infancy to abandon them to wild bea&s;ts; that it was held equally lawful to puni&s;h children, even capitally, for the crime of their parent; that the murdering an enemy in cold blood, was once a common practice; that human &s;acrifices, impious no le&s;s than immoral according to our notions, were of old univer&s;al; that even in later times, it has been held meritorious, to inflict cruel torments for the &s;lighte&s;t deviations from the religious creed of the plurality; and that among the mo&s;t en|lightened nations, there are con&s;iderable differen|ces with re&s;pect to the rules of morality.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts tend not to di&s;prove the reality of a common &s;en&s;e in morals: they only prove, that the moral &s;en&s;e has not been equally perfect at all times, nor in all countries. This branch of the hi&s;tory of morality, is re&s;erved for the &s;econd
<PB N="13" REF="17">
part. To give &s;ome pre&s;ent &s;atisfaction, I &s;hall &s;hortly ob&s;erve, that the &s;avage &s;tate is the in|fancy of man; during which, the more delicate &s;en&s;es lie dormant, leaving nations to the authori|ty of cu&s;tom, of imitation, and of pa&s;&s;ion, with|out any ju&s;t ta&s;te of morals more than of the fine arts: but nations, like individuals, ripen gradually, and acquire a refined ta&s;te in morals as well as in the fine arts: after which we find great uniformity of opinion about the rules of right and wrong; with few exceptions, but what may proceed from im|becility, or corrupted education. There may be found, it is true, even in the mo&s;t enlightened ages, men who have &s;ingular notions of morali|ty; and there may be found the like &s;ingularity upon many other &s;ubjects: which no more af|fords an argument again&s;t a common &s;en&s;e or &s;tandard of right and wrong, than a mon&s;ter doth again&s;t the &s;tandard that regulates our external form, or than an exception doth again&s;t the truth of a general propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>That there is in mankind an uniformity of opinion with re&s;pect to right and wrong, is a matter of fact of which the only infallible evi|dence is ob&s;ervation and experience: and to that evidence I appeal; entering only a caveat, that, for the rea&s;on above given, the enquiry be con|fined to enlightened nations. In the mean time, I take liberty to &s;ugge&s;t an argument from analo|gy, That if there be great uniformity among the different tribes of men in &s;eeing and hearing, in plea&s;ure and pain, in judging of truth and error, the &s;ame uniformity ought to hold with re&s;pect to right and wrong. Whatever minute differences there may be to di&s;tingui&s;h one per&s;on from ano|ther, yet in the general principles that con&s;titute our nature, internal and external, there is won|derful uniformity.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="18">
This uniformity of &s;entiment, which may be termed <HI>the common &s;en&s;e of mankind with re&s;pect to right and wrong,</HI> is e&s;&s;ential to &s;ocial beings. Did the moral &s;entiments of men differ as much as their faces, they would be altogether unqualified for &s;ociety: di&s;cord and controver&s;y would be end|le&s;s, and <HI>major vis</HI> would be the only rule of <HI>me|um et tuum.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;uch uniformity of &s;entiment, though ge|neral, is not altogether univer&s;al: men there are, as above mentioned, who differ from the com|mon &s;en&s;e of mankind with re&s;pect to various points of morality. What ought to be the con|duct of &s;uch men? ought they to regulate their conduct by that &s;tandard, or by their private con|viction? There will be occa&s;ion afterward to ob|&s;erve, that we judge of others as we believe they judge of them&s;elves; and that private conviction is the &s;tandard for rewards and puni&s;hments<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 5.</NOTE>. But with re&s;pect to every controver&s;y about pro|perty and pecuniary intere&s;t, and, in general, about every civil right and obligation, the common &s;en&s;e of mankind is the &s;tandard, and not private conviction or con&s;cience; which I &s;hall endeavour to make out as follows.</P>
<P>We have an innate &s;en&s;e of a common nature, not only in our own &s;pecies, but in every &s;pecies of animals. And that the fact corre&s;ponds to our &s;en&s;e of it, is verified by experience; for there appears a remarkable uniformity in creatures of the &s;ame kind, and a difformity, no le&s;s remark|able, in creatures of a different kind. As that common nature is perceived to be a model or &s;tandard for each individual of the kind, it rai&s;es wonder to find an individual deviating from the common nature of the &s;pecies, whether in its in|ternal
<PB N="15" REF="19">
or external &s;tructure: a child born with aver&s;ion to its mother's milk, is a wonder, no le&s;s than if born without a mouth, or with more than one.</P>
<P>Secondly, The innate &s;en&s;e mentioned dictates, that the common nature of man in particular, is invariable as well as univer&s;al; that it will be the &s;ame hereafter as it is at pre&s;ent, and as it was in time pa&s;t, the &s;ame among all nations, and in all corners of the earth: nor are we deceived; becau&s;e, allowing for &s;light differences occa&s;ioned by culture and other accidental circum&s;tances, the fact corre&s;ponds to our perception.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We perceive that this common nature is <HI>right</HI> and <HI>perfect,</HI> and that it <HI>ought</HI> to be a model or &s;tandard for every human being. Any re|markable deviation from it in the &s;tructure of an individual, appears imperfect or irregular; and rai&s;es a painful emotion: a mon&s;trous birth, exciting curio&s;ity in philo&s;ophers, fails not at the &s;ame time to excite aver&s;ion in every &s;pectator.</P>
<P>This &s;en&s;e of perfection in the common nature of man, comprehends every branch of his nature, and particularly the common &s;en&s;e of mankind with re&s;pect to right and wrong; which accord|ingly is perceived by all to be perfect, having authority over all men as the ultimate and uner|ring &s;tandard of morals, even in contradiction to private conviction. Thus, a law in our nature binds us to regulate our conduct by that &s;tandard: its authority is univer&s;ally acknowledged, as no|thing is more common in every di&s;pute about <HI>meum et tuum,</HI> than an appeal to it as the ultimate and unerring &s;tandard.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, as that &s;tandard through in|firmity or prejudice, is not con&s;picuous to every individual, many are mi&s;led into erroneous opini|ons, by mi&s;taking a fal&s;e &s;tandard for that of
<PB N="16" REF="20">
nature. And hence a di&s;tinction between a right and a wrong &s;en&s;e in morals; a di&s;tinction which every one under&s;tands, but which, unle&s;s for the conviction of a moral &s;tandard, would be altoge|ther unintelligible.</P>
<P>The final cau&s;e of this branch of our nature is con&s;picuous. Were there no &s;tandard of right and wrong for determining endle&s;s controver&s;ies about matters of intere&s;t, the &s;trong would have recour&s;e to force, the weak to cunning, and &s;o|ciety would be intolerable. Courts of law could afford no remedy; for without a &s;tandard of mo|rals, their deci&s;ions would be arbitrary, and of no authority. Happy it is for men to be provided with &s;uch a &s;tandard: it is nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ociety that our actions be uniform with re&s;pect to right and wrong; and in order to uniformity of action, it is nece&s;&s;ary that our perceptions of right and wrong be al&s;o uniform: to pro|duce &s;uch uniformity, a &s;tandard of morals is in|di&s;pen&s;able. Nature has provided us with that &s;tandard, which is daily applied by courts of law with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In reviewing what is &s;aid, it mu&s;t afford great &s;atisfaction, to find morality e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the mo&s;t &s;olid of all foundations, viz. intuitive per|ception, which is not only a &s;ingle mental act, but is complete in it&s;elf, having no dependence on any antecedent propo&s;ition. The mo&s;t accurate rea&s;oning affords not equal conviction; for every &s;ort of rea&s;oning, as explained in the &s;ketch im|mediately foregoing, requires not only &s;elf-evident truths or axioms to found upon, but employs over and above various propo&s;itions to bring out its conclu&s;ions. By intuitive percep|tion &s;olely, without rea&s;oning, we acquire know|ledge of right and wrong; of what we may do, of what we ought to do, and of what we ought
<PB N="17" REF="21">
to ab&s;tain from: and con&s;idering that we have thus greater certainty of moral laws, than of any propo&s;ition di&s;coverable by rea&s;oning, man may well be deemed a favourite of heaven, when he is &s;o admirably qualified for acting the part that is agreeable to his Maker. The moral &s;en&s;e or con&s;cience is the voice of God within us; con|&s;tantly admoni&s;hing us of our duty, and requi|ring from us no exerci&s;e of our faculties but at|tention merely. The celebrated Locke ventured what he thought a bold conjecture, That moral duties might be &s;u&s;ceptible of demon&s;tration: how agreeable would the di&s;covery have been to him, that they are founded upon intuitive per|ception, &s;till more convincing and authoritative!</P>
<P>By one branch of the moral &s;en&s;e, we are taught what we ought to do, and what we ought not to do; and by another branch, what we may do, or leave undone. But &s;ociety would be im|perfect, if the moral &s;en&s;e &s;topped here. There is no particular that tends more to complete &s;o|ciety, than what is mentioned in the fir&s;t &s;ection, viz. That every man is accountable for his con|duct to his fellow-creatures; and he is rendered accountable by a third branch of the moral &s;en&s;e, which teaches him, that this is his duty. And it will be made evident afterward, in the 3d &s;ketch, that we are accountable to our Maker, as well as to our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>To complete this theory, I add, that an action is right or wrong, independent of the actor's own opinion. Thus, when a man, excited by friend&s;hip or pity, re&s;cues a heretic from the flames, the action is right, even though he think it wrong, from a conviction that heretics ought to be burnt. But we apply a different rule to tho&s;e who act: a man is approved, and held to be innocent, when he does what he him|&s;elf
<PB N="18" REF="22">
thinks right; he is di&s;approved, and held to be guilty, when he does what he him&s;elf thinks wrong. Thus, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate an athei&s;t for the &s;ake of religion, is a wrong action; and yet the enthu&s;ia&s;t who commits that wrong, may be innocent: and one is guilty who, again&s;t con&s;cience, eats meat in lent, though the action is not wrong. In &s;hort, an action is perceiv|ed to be right or wrong, independent of the actor's own opinion: but he is approved or di&s;|approved, held to be innocent or guilty, according to his own opinion.</P>

When we reflect on the different branches of human knowledge, it might &s;eem, that of all &s;ubjects human nature &s;hould be the be&s;t under|&s;tood; becau&s;e every man has daily opportunities to &s;tudy it, in his own pa&s;&s;ions and in his own actions.

And however much &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s may prevail in ac|tion, it certainly prevails not in &s;entiment and affection: all men con&s;pire to put a high e&s;tima|tion upon genero&s;ity, benevolence and other &s;oci|al virtues; while even the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h are di&s;|gu&s;ted with &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in others, and endeavour to hide it in them&s;elves.

On the other hand, the &s;y&s;tem of univer&s;al benevolence, is no le&s;s con|tradictory to experience: from which we learn, that men commonly are di&s;po&s;ed to prefer their own intere&s;t before that of others, e&s;pecially where there is no &s;trict connection: nor do we find that &s;uch bias is oppo&s;ed by the moral &s;en&s;e.

di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, taking them in order, according to the extent of their influence. And for the &s;ake of per&s;picuity, I &s;hall fir&s;t pre&s;ent them in a gene|ral view, and then proceed to particulars. Of our duties to others, one there is &s;o exten&s;ive, as to have for its object all the innocent part of mankind. It is the duty that prohibits us to hurt others: than which no law is more clearly dicta|ted by the moral &s;en&s;e; nor is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of any other law more deeply &s;tamped with the character of wrong. A man may be hurt ex|ternally in his goods, in his per&s;on, in his re|lations, and in his reputation. Hence the laws, Do not &s;teal; Defraud not others; Do not kill nor wound; Be not guilty of defamation. A man may be hurt internally, by an action that occa&s;ions to him di&s;tre&s;s of mind, or by being impre&s;&s;ed with fal&s;e notions of men and things. Therefore con&s;cience dictates, that we ought not to treat men di&s;re&s;pectfully; that we ought not cau&s;ele&s;sly to alienate their affections from others; and, in general, that we ought to forbear what|ever may tend to break their peace of mind, or tend to unqualify them for being good men, and good citizens.</P>
<P>The duties mentioned are duties of re&s;traint. Our active duties regard particular per&s;ons; &s;uch as our relations, our friends, our benefac|tors, our ma&s;ters, our &s;ervants. It is our duty to honour and obey our parents; and to e&s;tabli&s;h our children in the world with all advantages internal and external: we ought to be faithful to our friends, grateful to our benefactors, &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive to our ma&s;ters, kind to our &s;ervants, and to aid and comfort every one of the&s;e per&s;ons when in di&s;tre&s;s. To be obliged to do good to others beyond the&s;e bounds, mu&s;t depend on po|&s;itive
<PB N="22" REF="26">
engagement; for, as will appear afterward, univer&s;al benevolence is not a duty.</P>
<P>This general &s;ketch will prepare us for particu|lars. The duty of re&s;traint comes fir&s;t in view, that which bars us from harming the innocent; and to it corre&s;ponds a right in the innocent to be &s;afe from harm. This is the great law prepa|ratory to &s;ociety; becau&s;e without it, &s;ociety could never have exi&s;ted. Here the moral &s;en&s;e is inflexible: it dictates, that we ought to &s;ub|mit to any di&s;tre&s;s, even death it&s;elf, rather than procure our own &s;afety by laying violent hands upon an innocent per&s;on. And we are under the &s;ame re&s;traint with re&s;pect to the property of an|other; for robbery and theft are never upon any pretext indulged. It is indeed true, that in ex|treme hunger I may lawfully take food where it can be found; and may freely lay hold of my neighbour's hor&s;e, to carry me from an enemy who threatens death. But it is his duty as a fel|low creature to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in di&s;tre&s;s; and when there is no time for delay, I may lawfully u&s;e what he ought to offer were he pre&s;ent, and what I may pre&s;ume he would offer. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, if in a &s;torm my &s;hip be driven among the anchor-ropes of another &s;hip, I may lawfully cut the ropes in order to get free. But in every ca&s;e of this kind, it would be a wrong in me to u&s;e my neighbour's property, without re&s;olving to pay the value. If my neighbour be bound to aid me in di&s;tre&s;s, con&s;cience binds me to make up his lo&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This doctrine is obviou&s;ly founded on ju&s;tice; and yet, in the Roman law, there are two pa&s;&s;ages which deny any recompence in &s;uch ca&s;es. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Item Labeo &s;cribit, &s;i cum vi ventorum navis impul&s;a e&s;&s;et in funes anchorarum alterius, et nautae funes praeci|di&s;&s;ent; &s;i nullo alio modo, ni&s;i praeci&s;is funibus, explicare &s;e potuit, nullam actionem dandam;"</Q> <HI>l.</HI> 29. &sect; 3. <HI>ad leg.

not much alarm plain people: but where man|ners and refined &s;entiments prevail, the mind is &s;u&s;ceptible of more grievous wounds than the bo|dy; and therefore, without that law, a poli&s;hed &s;ociety could have no long endurance.</P>
<P>By adultery, mi&s;chief is done both external and internal. Each &s;ex is &s;o con&s;tituted, as to re|quire &s;trict fidelity and attachment in a mate: and the breach of the&s;e duties is the greate&s;t exter|nal harm that can befal them: it harms them al&s;o internally, by breaking their peace of mind. It has indeed been urged, that no harm will en&s;ue, if the adultery be kept &s;ecret; and con&s;equently, that there can be no crime where there is no di&s;|covery. But &s;uch as rea&s;on thus do not advert, that to declare &s;ecret adultery to be lawful, is in effect to overturn every foundation of mutual tru&s;t and fidelity in the married &s;tate. It is clear beyond all doubt, &s;ays a reputable writer, that no man is permitted to violate his faith; and that the man is unju&s;t and barbarous who deprives his wife of the only reward &s;he has for adhering to the au&s;tere duties of her &s;ex. But an unfaithful wife is &s;till more criminal, by di&s;&s;olving the whole ties of nature: in giving to her hu&s;band children that are not his, &s;he betrays both, and joins per|fidy to infidelity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Emile, liv. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Veracity is commonly ranked among the active duties; but erroneou&s;ly: for if a man be not bound to &s;peak, he cannot be bound to &s;peak truth. It is therefore only a re&s;training duty, prohibiting us to deceive others, by affirming what is not true. Among the many corre&s;pond|ing principles in the human mind that in con|junction tend to make &s;ociety comfortable, a prin|ciple
<PB N="25" REF="29">
of veracity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Truth is always uppermo&s;t, being the natural i&s;|&s;ue of the mind: it requires no art nor training, no inducement nor temptation, but only that we yield to natural impul&s;e. Lying, on the contrary, is doing vi|olence to our nature; and is never practi&s;ed, even by the wor&s;t of men, without &s;ome temptation. Speak|ing truth is like u&s;ing our natural food, which we would do from appetite although it an&s;wered no end: lying is like taking phy&s;ic, which is nau&s;eous to the ta&s;te, and which no man takes but for &s;ome end which he cannot otherwi&s;e attain. <HI>Dr. Reid's Enquiry into the human mind.</HI></NOTE>, and a principle that leads us to rely on human te&s;timony, are two: without the latter, the former would be an u&s;ele&s;s prin|ciple; and without the former, the latter would lay us open to fraud and treachery. The moral &s;en&s;e accordingly dictates, that we ought to ad|here &s;trictly to truth, without regard to con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be inferred, that we are bound to explain our thoughts, when truth is demand|ed from us by unlawful means. Words uttered voluntarily, are naturally relied on, as expre&s;&s;ing the &s;peaker's mind; and if his mind differ from his words, he tells a lie, and is guilty of deceit. But words drawn from a man by torture, are no indication of his mind; and he is not guilty of deceit in uttering whatever words may be agree|able, however alien from his thoughts: if the author of the unlawful violence &s;uffer him&s;elf to be deceived, he ought to blame him&s;elf, not the &s;peaker.</P>
<P>It need &s;carce be mentioned, that the duty of veracity excludes not fable, nor any liberty of &s;peech intended for amu&s;ement &s;olely.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="30">
Active duties, as hinted above, are all of them directed to particular per&s;ons. And the fir&s;t I &s;hall mention is, that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between a parent and child. The relation of parent and child, the &s;tronge&s;t that can exi&s;t between indi|viduals, binds the&s;e per&s;ons to exert their utmo&s;t powers in mutual good offices. Benevolence among other blood-relations, is al&s;o a duty; but not &s;o indi&s;pen&s;able, being proportioned to the inferior degree of relation.</P>
<P>Gratitude is a duty directed to the per&s;on who has been kind to us. But though gratitude is &s;trictly a duty, the mea&s;ure of performance, and the kind, are left mo&s;tly to our own choice. It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to add, that the active duties now mentioned, are acknowledged by all to be ab&s;olutely inflexible, perhaps more &s;o than the re&s;training duties: many find excu&s;es for doing harm; but no one hears with patience an ex|cu&s;e for deviating from truth, friend&s;hip, or gratitude.</P>
<P>Di&s;tre&s;s tends to convert benevolence into a du|ty. But di&s;tre&s;s alone is not &s;ufficient, without other concurring circum&s;tances: for to relieve every per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s, is beyond the power of any human being. Our relations in di&s;tre&s;s claim that duty from us, and even our neighbours: but di&s;tant di&s;tre&s;s, without a particular connection, &s;carce rou&s;es our &s;ympathy, and never is an ob|ject of duty. Many other connections, too nu|merous for this &s;hort e&s;&s;ay, extend the duty of relieving others from di&s;tre&s;s; and the&s;e make a large branch of equity. Though in various in|&s;tances, benevolence is thus converted into a du|ty by di&s;tre&s;s, it follows not, that the duty is al|ways proportioned to the degree of di&s;tre&s;s. Na|ture has more wi&s;ely provided for the &s;upport of virtue. A virtuous per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s commands
<PB N="27" REF="31">
our pity: a vicious per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s has much le&s;s influence; and if by vice he have brought on the di&s;tre&s;s, indignation is rai&s;ed, not pi|ty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Elements of Critici&s;m, vol. 1. p. 187. edit. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>One great advantage of &s;ociety, is the co-operation of many to accompli&s;h &s;ome u&s;eful work, where a &s;ingle hand would be in&s;ufficient. Arts, manufactures, and commercial dealings, re|quire many hands: but as hands cannot be &s;ecur|ed without a previous engagement, the perfor|mance of promi&s;es and covenants, is, upon that account, a capital duty in &s;ociety. In their ori|ginal occupations of hunting and fi&s;hing, men liv|ing &s;cattered and di&s;per&s;ed, have &s;eldom oppor|tunity to aid and benefit each other; and in that &s;ituation, covenants being of little u&s;e, are little regarded: but hu&s;bandry requiring the co-opera|tion of many hands, draws men together for mu|tual a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and then covenants make a figure: arts and commerce make them more and more ne|ce&s;&s;ary; and in a poli&s;hed &s;ociety great regard is paid to them.</P>
<P>But contracts and promi&s;es are not confined to commercial dealings: they &s;erve al&s;o to make be|nevolence a duty; and are even extended to con|nect the living with the dead: a man would die with regret, if he thought his friends were not bound by their promi&s;es, to fulfil his will after his death: and to quiet the minds of men with re|&s;pect to futurity, the moral &s;en&s;e makes the per|forming &s;uch promi&s;es our duty. Thus, if I pro|mi&s;e to my friend to erect a monument for him after his death, con&s;cience binds me, even though
<PB N="28" REF="32">
no per&s;on alive be entitled to demand perfor|mance: every one perceives this to be my duty; and I mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer reproach and blame, if I neglect my engagement.</P>
<P>To fulfil a rational promi&s;e or covenant, deli|berately made, is a duty no le&s;s inflexible than tho&s;e duties are which ari&s;e independent of con|&s;ent. But as man is fallible, often mi&s;led by ig|norance or error, and liable to be deceived, his condition would be deplorable, did the moral &s;en&s;e compel him to fulfil every engagement, however imprudent or irrational. Here the mo|ral &s;en&s;e gives way to human infirmity: it relieves from deceit, from impo&s;ition, from ignorance, from error; and binds a man by no engagement but what an&s;wers the end fairly intended.</P>
<P>The other branch of duties, viz. tho&s;e we owe to our&s;elves, &s;hall be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a few words. <HI>Propriety,</HI> a branch of the moral &s;en&s;e, regulates our conduct with re&s;pect to our&s;elves; as <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> another branch of the moral &s;en&s;e, regulates our conduct with re&s;pect to others. Propriety dic|tates, that we ought to act up to the dignity of our nature, and to the &s;tation allotted us by Pro|vidence: it dictates in particular, that temper|ance, prudence, mode&s;ty, and uniformity of con|duct, are &s;elf duties. The&s;e duties contribute to private happine&s;s, by pre&s;erving health, peace of mind, and &s;elf-e&s;teem; which are ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings: they contribute no le&s;s to happine&s;s in &s;ociety, by gaining the love and e&s;teem of others, and aid and &s;upport in time of need.</P>
<P>Upon reviewing the foregoing duties re&s;pect|ing others, we find them more or le&s;s exten&s;ive; but none &s;o exten&s;ive as to have for their end the good of mankind in general. The mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive duty is that of re&s;traint, prohibiting us to harm others: but even that duty has a limited
<PB N="29" REF="33">
end; for its purpo&s;e is only to protect others from mi&s;chief, not to do them any po&s;itive good. The active duties of doing po&s;itive good are circum&s;cribed within &s;till narrower bounds, re|quiring &s;ome relation that connects us with o|thers; &s;uch as tho&s;e of parent, child, friend, benefactor. The &s;lighter relations, unle&s;s in pe|culiar circum&s;tances, are not the foundation of any active duty: neighbourhood, for example, does not alone make benevolence a duty: but &s;uppo&s;ing a neighbour to be in di&s;tre&s;s, it be|comes our duty to relieve him, if it can be done without di&s;tre&s;s to our&s;elves. The duty of reliev|ing from di&s;tre&s;s, &s;eldom goes farther; for though we always &s;ympathi&s;e with our relations, and with tho&s;e under our eye, the di&s;tre&s;s of per&s;ons remote and unknown affects us very little. Pac|tions and agreements become nece&s;&s;ary, if we would extend the duty of benevolence, in any particular, beyond the limits mentioned. Men, it is true, are capable of doing more good than is required of them as a duty; but every &s;uch good mu&s;t be a free-will offering.</P>
<P>And this leads to arbitrary actions, viz. tho&s;e that may be done or left undone; which make the &s;econd general head of moral actions. With re&s;pect to the&s;e, the moral &s;en&s;e leaves us at freedom: a benevolent act is approved, but the omi&s;&s;ion is not condemned. This holds &s;trictly in &s;ingle acts; but in viewing the whole of a man's conduct, the moral &s;en&s;e appears to vary a little. As the nature of man is complex, partly &s;ocial, partly &s;elfi&s;h, we have an intuitive per|ception, that our conduct ought to be con|formable to our nature; and that in advancing our own intere&s;t, we ought not altogether to ne|glect that of others. The man accordingly who confines his whole time and thoughts within his
<PB N="30" REF="34">
own little &s;phere, is condemned by all the world as guilty of wrong conduct; and the man him|&s;elf, if his moral perceptions be not blunted by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that he de&s;erves to be condemned. On the other hand, it is po&s;&s;ible that free benevolence may be extended beyond proper bounds. The ju&s;t temperament is a &s;ub|ordination of benevolence to &s;elf-love: but where benevolence prevails, it commonly leads to ex|ce&s;s, by prompting a man to &s;acrifice a great in|tere&s;t of his own to a &s;mall intere&s;t of others; and the moral &s;en&s;e dictates, that &s;uch conduct is wrong.</P>
<P>Thus, moral actions are divided into two cla&s;|&s;es: the fir&s;t regards our duty, containing actions that ought to be done, and actions that ought not to be done; the other regards arbitrary actions, containing actions that are right when done, but not wrong when left undone. The well-being of &s;ociety depends more on the fir&s;t cla&s;s than on the &s;econd: &s;ociety is indeed promoted by the latter; but it can &s;carce &s;ub&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s the former be made our duty. Hence it is, that actions only of the fir&s;t cla&s;s are made indi&s;pen&s;able; tho&s;e of the other cla&s;s being left to our free-will. And hence al&s;o it is, that the various propen&s;ities that di&s;po&s;e us to actions of the fir&s;t &s;ort, are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of <HI>primary virtues;</HI> leaving the name of <HI>&s;econdary virtues</HI> to tho&s;e propen&s;i|ties which di&s;po&s;e us to actions of the other &s;ort<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Virtue &s;ignifies that di&s;po&s;ition of mind which gives the a&s;cendant to moral principles. Vice &s;ignifies that di&s;po&s;ition of mind which gives little or no a&s;|cendant to moral principles.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="35">
The deduction above given makes it evident, that the general tendency of right actions is to promote the good of &s;ociety, and of wrong acti|ons, to ob&s;truct that good. Univer&s;al benevo|lence is indeed not required of man; becau&s;e to put that principle in practice, is beyond his ut|mo&s;t abilities. But for promoting the general good, every thing is required of him that he can accompli&s;h; which will appear from reviewing the foregoing duties. The prohibition of harm|ing others is an ea&s;y ta&s;k; and upon that account is made univer&s;al. Our active duties are very different: man is circum&s;cribed both in capacity and power: he cannot do good but in a &s;low &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion; and therefore it is wi&s;ely ordered, that his obligation to do good &s;hould be confined to his relations, his friends, his benefactors. Even di&s;tre&s;s makes not benevolence a general duty: all a man can readily do, is to relieve tho&s;e at hand; and accordingly we hear of di&s;tant misfor|tunes with little or no concern.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, let not the moral &s;y&s;tem be mi&s;apprehended, as if it were our duty, or even lawful, to pro&s;ecute what upon the whole we reckon the mo&s;t beneficial to &s;ociety, balancing ill with good. The moral &s;en&s;e permits not a vi|olation of any per&s;on's right, however trivial, whatever benefit may thereby accrue to another. A man, for example, in low circum&s;tances, by denying a debt he owes to a rich mi&s;er, &s;aves him&s;elf and a hopeful family from ruin. In that ca&s;e, the good effect far outweighs the ill, or ra|ther has no counterbalance: but the moral &s;en&s;e permits not the debtor to balance ill with good; nor gives countenance to an unju&s;t act, whatever benefit it may produce. And hence a maxim in which all morali&s;ts agree, That we mu&s;t not do

<HEAD>Principles of DUTY and of BENEVOLENCE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus &s;hortly delineated the moral laws of our nature, we proceed to an arti|cle of great importance, which is, to enquire in|to the means provided by our Maker for compel|ling obedience to the&s;e laws. The moral &s;en&s;e is an unerring guide; but the mo&s;t expert guide will not profit tho&s;e who are not di&s;po&s;ed to fol|low. This con&s;ideration makes it evident, that to complete the moral &s;y&s;tem, we ought to be en|dued with &s;ome principle or propen&s;ity, &s;ome impul&s;ive power, to enforce obedience to the laws dictated by the moral &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The author of our nature leaves none of his works imperfect. In order to render us ob&s;equi|ous to the moral &s;en&s;e as our guide, he hath im|planted in our nature the principles of duty, of benevolence, of rewards and puni&s;hments, and of reparation. It may po&s;&s;ibly be thought, that
<PB N="33" REF="37">
rewards and puni&s;hments, of which afterward, are &s;ufficient of them&s;elves to enforce the laws of nature, without nece&s;&s;ity of any other principle. Human laws, it is true, are enforced by the&s;e means; becau&s;e no higher &s;anction is under com|mand of a terre&s;trial legi&s;lator. But the cele&s;ti|al legi&s;lator, with power that knows no control, and benevolence that knows no bounds, hath en|forced his laws by means no le&s;s remarkable for mildne&s;s than for efficacy: he employs no exter|nal compul&s;ion; but, in order to engage our will on the right &s;ide, hath in the brea&s;t of every in|dividual e&s;tabli&s;hed the principles of duty and of benevolence, which efficaciou&s;ly excite us to obey the dictates of the moral &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>As the re&s;training, as well as active duties, are e&s;&s;ential to &s;ociety, our Maker has wi&s;ely orde|red, that the principle which enforces the&s;e &s;e|veral duties, &s;hould be the mo&s;t cogent of all that belong to our nature. Other principles may &s;olicit, allure, or terrify; but the principle of duty a&s;&s;umes authority, commands, and mu&s;t be obeyed.</P>
<P>As one great purpo&s;e of &s;ociety, is to furni&s;h opportunities without end of mutual aid and &s;up|port, nature &s;econding that purpo&s;e, hath pro|vided the principle of benevolence; which ex|cites us to be kind, beneficent, and generous. Nor ought it to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation, that the Au|thor of nature, attentive to our wants and to our well-being, hath endued us with a liberal portion of that principle. It enforces benevolence, not only to tho&s;e we are connected with, but to our neighbours, and even to tho&s;e we are barely ac|quainted with. Providence is peculiarly attentive to objects in di&s;tre&s;s, who require immediate aid and relief. To the general principle of benevo|lence, it hath &s;uperadded the pa&s;&s;ion of pity,
<PB N="34" REF="38">
which in every feeling heart is irre&s;i&s;tible. To make benevolence more exten&s;ive, would be fruitle&s;s, becau&s;e here are objects in plenty to fill the mo&s;t capacious mind. It would not be fruitle&s;s only, but hurtful to &s;ociety: I &s;ay hurt|ful; for inability to procure gratification, rende|ring benevolence a trouble&s;ome gue&s;t, would weaken the principle it&s;elf, and attach us the more to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which we can always gratify. At the &s;ame time, though there is not room for greater variety of particular objects, yet the fa|culty we have of uniting numberle&s;s individuals in one complex object, enlarges greatly the &s;phere of benevolence: by that faculty our coun|try, our government, our religion, become ob|jects of public &s;pirit, and of a lively affection. The individuals that compo&s;e the group, con&s;i|dered apart, may be too minute, or too di&s;tant, for our benevolence; but when comprehended in one great whole, accumulation makes them great, greatne&s;s renders them con&s;picuous; and affecti|on, pre&s;erved entire and undivided, is be&s;towed upon an ab&s;tract object, as upon one that is &s;in|gle and vi&s;ible; but with much greater energy, being proportioned to its &s;uperior dignity and im|portance. Thus it appears, that the principle of benevolence is not too &s;paringly &s;cattered among men. It is indeed made &s;ubordinate to &s;elf-inte|re&s;t, which is wi&s;ely ordered, as will afterward be made evident<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 7.</NOTE>; but its power and extent are nicely proportioned to the limited capacity of man, and to his &s;ituation in this world; &s;o as better to fulfil its de&s;tination, than if it were an overmatch for &s;elf-intere&s;t, and for every other principle.</P>

<HEAD>Laws re&s;pecting REWARDS and PUNISHMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>REFLECTING on the moral branch of our nature, qualifying us for &s;ociety in a man|ner &s;uited to our capacity, we cannot overlook the hand of our Maker; for means &s;o finely ad|ju&s;ted to an important end, never happen by chance. It mu&s;t however be acknowledged, that in many individuals, the principle of duty has not vigour nor authority &s;ufficient to &s;tem every tide of unruly pa&s;&s;ion: by the vigilance of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ions, we are taken unguarded; deluded by the fly in&s;inuations of others; or overwhelmed with the &s;tormy impetuo&s;ity of a third &s;ort. Moral evil is thus introduced; and much wrong is done. This new &s;cene &s;ugge&s;ts to us, that there mu&s;t be &s;ome article &s;till wanting, to complete the mo|ral &s;y&s;tem. The means provided for directing us in the road of duty have been explained: but as in deviating from the road wrongs are committed, nothing hitherto has been &s;aid, about redre&s;&s;ing &s;uch wrongs, nor about preventing the reiteration of them. To accompli&s;h the&s;e important ends, there are added to the moral &s;y&s;tem, laws rela|tive
<PB N="36" REF="40">
to rewards and puni&s;hments, and to repara|tion; of which in their order.</P>
<P>Many animals are qualified for &s;ociety by in|&s;tinct merely; &s;uch as beavers, &s;heep, monkeys, bees, rooks. But men are &s;eldom led by in&s;tinct: their actions are commonly prompted by pa&s;&s;ions; of which there is an endle&s;s variety, &s;ocial and &s;elfi&s;h, benevolent and malevolent. And were every pa&s;&s;ion equally entitled to gratification, man would be utterly unqualified for &s;ociety: he would be a &s;hip without a rudder, obedient to every wind, and moving at random, without any ultimate de&s;tination. The faculty of rea&s;on would make no oppo&s;ition: for were there no &s;en&s;e of wrong, it would be rea&s;onable to gratify every de&s;ire that harms not our&s;elves: and to talk of puni&s;hment would be ab&s;urd; for puni&s;hment, in its very idea, implies &s;ome wrong that ought to be redre&s;&s;ed. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of the moral &s;en&s;e, to qualify us for &s;ociety: by in&s;tructing us in our duty, it renders us accountable for our conduct, and makes us &s;u&s;ceptible of rewards and puni&s;hments. The moral &s;en&s;e fulfils another valuable purpo&s;e: it erects in man an unerring &s;tandard for the application and mea&s;ure of re|wards and puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>To complete the &s;y&s;tem of rewards and puni&s;h|ments, it is nece&s;&s;ary that a provi&s;ion be made, both of power and of willingne&s;s to reward and puni&s;h. The Author of our nature hath provi|ded amply for the former, by entitling every man to reward and puni&s;h as his native privilege. And he has provided for the latter, by a noted principle in our nature, prompting us to exerci&s;e the power. Impelled by that principle, we re|ward the virtuous with approbation and e&s;teem, and puni&s;h the vicious with di&s;approbation and contempt. So prevalent is the principle, that
<PB N="37" REF="41">
we have great &s;atisfaction in rewarding, and no le&s;s in puni&s;hing.</P>
<P>As to puni&s;hment in particular, an action done intentionally to produce mi&s;chief, is criminal, and merits puni&s;hment. Such an action, being di&s;a|greeable, rai&s;es my re&s;entment, even where I have no connection with the per&s;on injured; and the principle under con&s;ideration impels me to cha&s;ti&s;e the delinquent with indignation and hatred. An injury done to my&s;elf rai&s;es my re|&s;entment to a higher tone: I am not &s;atisfied with &s;o &s;light a puni&s;hment as indignation and hatred: the author mu&s;t by my hand &s;uffer mi&s;chief, as great as he has made me &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Even the mo&s;t &s;ecret crime e&s;capes not puni&s;h|ment. The delinquent is tortured with remor&s;e: he even de&s;ires to be puni&s;hed; &s;ometimes &s;o ardently, as him&s;elf to be the executioner. There cannot be imagined a contrivance more effectual, to deter one from vice; for remor&s;e is it&s;elf a grievous puni&s;hment. Self-puni&s;hment goes &s;till farther: every criminal, &s;en&s;ible that he ought to be puni&s;hed, dreads puni&s;hment from others; and this dread, however &s;mothered during pro&s;|perity, breaks out in adver&s;ity, or in depre&s;&s;ion of mind: his crime &s;tares him in the face, and every accidental misfortune is in his di&s;turbed imagination interpreted to be a puni&s;hment. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And they &s;aid one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we &s;aw the angui&s;h of his &s;oul, when he be&s;ought us; and we would not hear: therefore is this di&s;|tre&s;s come upon us.

We have &s;een that there is an invariable &s;tan|dard of right and wrong, which depends not in any degree on private opinion or conviction. By that &s;tandard, all pecuniary claims are judged, all claims of property, and, in a word, every de|mand founded on intere&s;t, not excepting repara|tion, as will afterward appear. But with re&s;pect to the moral characters of men, and with re&s;pect to rewards and puni&s;hments, a different &s;tandard is erected in the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, nei|ther rigid nor inflexible; which is, the opinion that men have of their own actions. It is mentioned above, that a man is e&s;teemed innocent in doing what he him&s;elf thinks right, and guilty in doing what he him&s;elf thinks wrong. In applying this &s;tandard to rewards and puni&s;hments, we reward tho&s;e who in doing wrong are however convinced that they are innocent; and puni&s;h tho&s;e who in doing right are however convinced that they are guilty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Virtuous and vicious, innocent and guilty, &s;ignify qualities both of men and of their actions.

Further, if mi&s;chief be done contrary to Will, as where a

Where a man does mi&s;chief intentionally, or is <HI>ver&s;ans in illicito,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ed in the Roman law, he is ju&s;tly bound to repair all the harm that en&s;ues, how|ever accidentally; and from the re&s;emblance of pecu|niary puni&s;hment to reparation, the rule was childi&s;hly extended to puni&s;hment.

The Engli&s;h mu&s;t be excepted, who, remarkably tenacious of their original laws and cu&s;toms, pre&s;erve in force, even as to capital puni&s;hment, the above-mentioned rule that obtained among barbarians, when pecuniary compo&s;i|tions were in vigour.

<HEAD>Laws re&s;pecting REPARATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE principle of reparation is made a branch of the moral &s;y&s;tem for accompli&s;hing two ends: which are, to repre&s;s wrongs that are not criminal, and to make up the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by wrongs of whatever kind. With re&s;pect to the former, reparation is a &s;pecies of puni&s;hment: with re&s;pect to the latter, it is an act of ju&s;tice. The&s;e ends will be better under&s;tood, after a&s;cer|taining the nature and foundation of reparation; to which the following divi&s;ion of actions is ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Fir&s;t, actions that we are bound to per|form. Second, actions that we perform in pro|&s;ecution
<PB N="44" REF="48">
of a right or privilege. Third, indiffe|rent actions, de&s;cribed above. Actions of the fir&s;t kind &s;ubject not a man to reparation, whate|ver damage en&s;ues; becau&s;e it is his duty to per|form them, and it would be incon&s;i&s;tent with morality that a man &s;hould be &s;ubjected to repa|ration for doing his duty. The laws of reparation that concern actions of the &s;econd kind, are more complex. The &s;ocial &s;tate, highly beneficial by affording opportunity for mutual good offices, is attended with &s;ome inconveniencies; as where a per&s;on happens to be in a &s;ituation of nece&s;&s;arily harming others by exerci&s;ing a right or privilege. If the fore&s;ight of harming another, re&s;train me not from exerci&s;ing my right, the intere&s;t of that other is made &s;ub&s;ervient to mine: on the other hand, if &s;uch fore&s;ight re&s;train me from exerci|&s;ing my right, my intere&s;t is made &s;ub&s;ervient to his. What doth the moral &s;en&s;e provide in that ca&s;e? To pre&s;erve as far as po&s;&s;ible an equality among per&s;ons born free, and by nature equal in rank, the moral &s;en&s;e lays down a rule, no le&s;s beautiful than &s;alutary; which is, That the exerci&s;ing a right will not ju&s;tify me for doing direct mi&s;chief; but will ju&s;tify me, though I fore&s;ee that mi&s;chief may po&s;&s;ibly happen. The fir&s;t branch of the rule re&s;olves into a pro|po&s;ition e&s;tabli&s;hed above, viz. That no intere&s;t of mine, not even life it&s;elf, will authori&s;e me to hurt an innocent per&s;on. The other branch is &s;upported by expediency: for if the bare po&s;&s;ibi|lity of hurting others were &s;ufficient to re&s;train a man from pro&s;ecuting his rights and privileges, men would be too much cramped in action; or rather would be reduced to a &s;tate of ab&s;olute inactivity. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t branch, I am criminal, and liable even to puni&s;hment: with
<PB N="45" REF="49">
re&s;pect to the other, I am not even culpable, nor bound to repair the mi&s;chief that happens to en&s;ue.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the third kind, viz. indifferent actions, the moral &s;en&s;e dictates, that we ought carefully to avoid doing mi&s;chief, either direct or con&s;equential. As we &s;uffer no lo&s;s by forbearing actions that are done for pa&s;time merely, &s;uch an action is <HI>culpable</HI> or <HI>faulty,</HI> if the con&s;equent mi&s;chief was fore&s;een or might have been fore|&s;een; and the actor of cour&s;e is &s;ubjected to re|paration. As this is a cardinal point in the doctrine of reparation, I &s;hall endeavour to ex|plain it more fully. Without intending any harm, a man may fore&s;ee, that what he is about to do will probably or po&s;&s;ibly produce mi&s;chief; and &s;ometimes mi&s;chief follows that was neither in|tended nor fore&s;een. The action in the former ca&s;e is not criminal; becau&s;e ill intention is e&s;|&s;ential to a crime: but it is culpable or faulty; and if mi&s;chief en&s;ue, the actor blames him&s;elf, and is blamed by others, for having done what he ought not to have done. Thus, a man who throws a large &s;tone among a crowd of people, is highly culpable; becau&s;e he mu&s;t fore&s;ee that mi&s;chief will probably en&s;ue, though he has no intention to hurt any per&s;on. As to the latter ca&s;e, though mi&s;chief was neither intended nor fore&s;een, yet if it might have been fore&s;een, the action is ra&s;h or uncautious, and con&s;equently cul|pable or faulty in &s;ome degree. Thus, if a man in pulling down an old hou&s;e, happen to wound one pa&s;&s;ing accidentally, without calling aloud to keep out of the way, the action is in &s;ome de|gree culpable, becau&s;e the mi&s;chief might have been fore&s;een. But though mi&s;chief en&s;ue, an action is not culpable or faulty if all rea&s;onable precaution have been adhibited: the moral &s;en&s;e
<PB N="46" REF="50">
declares the author to be innocent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Innocent</HI> here is oppo&s;ed to <HI>culpable&punc;</HI> in a broader &s;en&s;e it is oppo&s;ed to <HI>criminal.</HI> With re&s;pect to puni&s;h|ment, an action though culpable is innocent, if it be not criminal: with re&s;pect to reparation, it is not innocent if it be culpable.</NOTE> and blame|le&s;s: the mi&s;chief is accidental, and the action may be termed <HI>unlucky,</HI> but comes not under the denomination of either right or wrong. In ge|neral, when we act merely for amu&s;ement, our nature makes us an&s;werable for the harm that en&s;ues, if it was either fore&s;een or might with due attention have been fore&s;een. But our rights and privileges would profit us little, if their ex|erci&s;e were put under the &s;ame re&s;traint: it is more wi&s;ely ordered, that the probability of mi&s;|chief, even fore&s;een, &s;hould not re&s;train a man from pro&s;ecuting his concerns which may often be of con&s;equence to him. He proceeds ac|cordingly with a &s;afe con&s;cience, and is not afraid of being blamed either by God or man.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to ra&s;h or uncautious actions, where the mi&s;chief might have been fore&s;een though not actually fore&s;een, it is not &s;ufficient to e&s;cape blame, that a man, naturally ra&s;h or inattentive, acts according to his character: a de|gree of precaution is required, both by him&s;elf and by others, &s;uch as is natural to the generality of men: he perceives that he might and <HI>ought</HI> to have acted more cautiou&s;ly; and his con&s;cience reproaches him for his inattention, no le&s;s than if he were naturally more &s;edate and atten|tive. Thus the circum&s;pection natural to mankind in general, is applied as a &s;tandard to every individual; and if they fall &s;hort of that &s;tandard, they are culpable and blameable,
<PB N="47" REF="51">
however unfore&s;een by them the mi&s;chief may have been.</P>
<P>What is &s;aid upon culpable actions is equally applicable to culpable omi&s;&s;ions; for by the&s;e al&s;o mi&s;chief may be occa&s;ioned, entitling the &s;ufferer to reparation. If we forbear to do our duty with an intention to occa&s;ion mi&s;chief, the forbearance is criminal. The only que&s;tion is, how far forbearance without &s;uch intention is culpable. Suppo&s;ing the probability of mi&s;chief to have been fore&s;een, though not intended, the omi&s;&s;ion is highly culpable; and though neither intended nor fore&s;een, yet the omi&s;&s;ion is culpable in a lower degree, if there have been le&s;s care and attention than are proper for performing the duty required. But &s;uppo&s;ing all due care, the omi&s;&s;ion of extreme care and diligence is not cul|pable.</P>
<P>By a&s;certaining what acts and omi&s;&s;ions are cul|pable or faulty, the doctrine of reparation is ren|dered extremely &s;imple; for it may be laid down as a rule without a &s;ingle exception, That every culpable act, and every culpable omi&s;&s;ion, binds us in con&s;cience to repair the mi&s;chief occa&s;ioned by it. The moral &s;en&s;e binds us no farther; for it loads not with reparation the man who is blame|le&s;s and innocent: the harm is accidental; and we are &s;o con&s;tituted as not to be re&s;pon&s;ible in con&s;cience for what happens by accident. But here it is requi&s;ite, that the man be in every re&s;pect innocent: for if he intend harm, though not what he has done, he will find him&s;elf bound in con&s;cience to repair the accidental harm he has done; as, for example, when aiming a blow un|ju&s;tly at one in the dark, he happens to wound an|other whom he did not &s;u&s;pect to be there. And hence it is a rule in all municipal laws, That one <HI>ver&s;ans in illicito</HI> is liable to repair every con|&s;equent
<PB N="48" REF="52">
damage. That the&s;e particulars are wi&s;ely ordered by the Author of our nature for the good of &s;ociety, will appear afterwards<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 7.</NOTE>. In ge|neral, the rules above mentioned are dictated by the moral &s;en&s;e; and we are compelled to obey them by the principle of reparation.</P>
<P>We are now prepared for a more particular in|&s;pection of the two ends of reparation above mentioned, viz. the repre&s;&s;ing wrongs that are not criminal, and the making up what lo&s;s is &s;u&s;|tained by wrongs of whatever kind. With re|&s;pect to the fir&s;t, it is clear, that puni&s;hment, in its proper &s;en&s;e, cannot be inflicted for a wrong that is culpable only; and if nature did not pro|vide &s;ome means for repre&s;&s;ing &s;uch wrongs, &s;o|ciety would &s;carce be a comfortable &s;tate. Lay|ing con&s;cience a&s;ide, pecuniary reparation is the only remedy that can be provided again&s;t culpable omi&s;&s;ions: and with re&s;pect to culpable commi&s;|&s;ions, the nece&s;&s;ity of reparation is &s;till more ap|parent; for con&s;cience alone, without the &s;anc|tion of reparation, would &s;eldom have authority &s;ufficient to re&s;train us from acting ra&s;hly or un|cautiou&s;ly, even where the po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;|chief is fore&s;een, and far le&s;s where it is not fore&s;een.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;econd end of reparation, my con&s;cience dictates to me, that if a man &s;uf|fer by my fault, whether the mi&s;chief was fore|&s;een or not fore&s;een, it is my duty to make up his lo&s;s; and I perceive intuitively, that the lo&s;s ought to re&s;t ultimately upon me, and not upon the &s;ufferer, who has not been culpable in any degree.</P>
<P>In every ca&s;e where the mi&s;chief done can be e&s;timated by a pecuniary compen&s;ation, the two
<PB N="49" REF="53">
ends of reparation coincide. The &s;um is taken from the one as a &s;ort of puni&s;hment for his fault, and is be&s;towed on the other to make up the lo&s;s he has &s;u&s;tained. But in numberle&s;s ca&s;es where mi&s;chief done cannot be compen&s;ated with mo|ney, reparation is in its nature a &s;ort of puni&s;h|ment. Defamation, contemptuous treatment, per|&s;onal re&s;traint, the breaking one's peace of mind, are injuries that cannot be repaired by money; and the pecuniary reparation decreed again&s;t the wrong-doer, can only be a &s;ort of puni&s;hment, in order to deter him from reiterating &s;uch inju|ries: the &s;um, it is true, is awarded to the per|&s;on injured; but not as &s;ufficient to make up his lo&s;s, which money cannot do, but only as a <HI>&s;ola|tium</HI> for what he has &s;uffered.</P>
<P>Hitherto it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the man who in|tends a wrong action, is, at the &s;ame time, con|&s;cious of its being &s;o. But a man may intend a wrong action, thinking erroneou&s;ly that it is right; or a right action, thinking erroneou&s;ly that it is wrong; and the que&s;tion is, What &s;hall be the con&s;equence of &s;uch errors with re&s;pect to reparation. The latter ca&s;e is clear: the per&s;on who occa&s;ionally &s;uffers lo&s;s by a right action, has not a claim for reparation, becau&s;e he has no ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint. On the other hand, if the action be wrong, the innocence of the author, for which he is indebted to an error in judgment, will not relieve him from reparation. When he is made &s;en&s;ible of his error, he feels him&s;elf bound in con&s;cience to repair the harm he has done by a wrong action: and others, &s;en&s;ible of his error from the beginning, have the &s;ame feel|ing: nor will his ob&s;tinacy in re&s;i&s;ting conviction, or his dullne&s;s in not apprehending his error, mend the matter: it is well that the&s;e defects re|lieve him from puni&s;hment, without wronging
<PB N="50" REF="54">
others by denying a claim for reparation. A man's errors ought to affect him&s;elf only, and not tho&s;e who have not erred. Hence in general, repara|tion always follows wrong; and is not affected by any erroneous opinion of a wrong action being right, more than of a right action being wrong.</P>
<P>But this doctrine &s;uffers an exception with re|&s;pect to a man, who having undertaken a tru&s;t, is bound in duty to act. A judge is in that &s;itua|tion: it is his duty to pronounce &s;entence in eve|ry ca&s;e that comes before him; and if he judge according to the be&s;t of his knowledge, he is not liable for con&s;equences. A judge cannot be &s;ub|jected to reparation, unle&s;s it can be verified, that the judgment he gave was intentionally wrong. An officer of the revenue is in the &s;ame predicament. Led by a doubtful clau&s;e in a &s;ta|tute, he makes a &s;eizure of goods as forfeited to the crown, which afterward, in the proper court, are found not to be &s;eizable. The officer ought not to be &s;ubjected to reparation, if he have act|ed to the be&s;t of his judgment. This rule how|ever mu&s;t be taken with a limitation: a public officer who is gro&s;sly erroneous, will not be ex|cu&s;ed; for he ought to know better.</P>
<P>Reparation is due, though the immediate act be involuntary, provided it be connected with a preceding voluntary act. Example: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If A ride an unruly hor&s;e in Lincolns-inn fields, to tame him, and the hor&s;e breaking from A, run over B and grievou&s;ly hurt him; B &s;hall have an action again&s;t A: for though the mi&s;|chief was done again&s;t the will of A, yet &s;ince it was his fault to bring a wild hor&s;e into a frequented place, where mi&s;chief might en&s;ue, he mu&s;t an&s;wer for the con&s;equences."</Q> Gai|us &s;eems to carry this rule &s;till farther, holding in general, that if a hor&s;e, by the weakne&s;s or un|&s;kilfulne&s;s
<PB N="51" REF="55">
of the rider, break away and do mi&s;|chief, the rider is liable<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">l. 8. &sect; 1. ad leg. Aquil.</NOTE>. But Gaius proba|bly had in his eye a frequented place, where the mi&s;chief might have been fore&s;een. Thus in ge|neral a man is made liable for the mi&s;chief occa&s;i|oned by his voluntary deed, though the immedi|ate act that occa&s;ioned the mi&s;chief be involun|tary.</P>

<HEAD>FINAL CAUSES of the foregoing Laws of Nature.</HEAD>
<P>SEVERAL final cau&s;es have been occa&s;ionally mentioned in preceding parts of this e&s;&s;ay, which could not conveniently be re&s;erved for the pre&s;ent &s;ection, being nece&s;&s;ary for explaining the &s;ubjects to which they relate, the final cau&s;e for in&s;tance of erecting a &s;tandard of morals up|on the common &s;en&s;e of mankind. I proceed now to what have not been mentioned, or but &s;light|ly mentioned.</P>
<P>The final cau&s;e that pre&s;ents it&s;elf fir&s;t to view, re&s;pects man con&s;idered as an accountable being. The &s;en&s;e of being accountable, is one
<PB N="52" REF="56">
of our mo&s;t vigilant guards again&s;t the &s;ilent at|tacks of vice. When a temptation moves me, it immediately occurs, What will the world &s;ay? I imagine my friends expo&s;tulating, my enemies reviling&mdash;I dare not di&s;&s;emble&mdash;my &s;pirits &s;ink&mdash;the temptation vani&s;hes. 2dly, Prai&s;e and blame, e&s;pecially from tho&s;e we regard, are &s;trong incentives to virtue: but if we were not accountable for our conduct, prai&s;e and blame would be &s;eldom well directed; for how &s;hould a man's intentions be known, without calling him to account? And prai&s;e or blame, frequently ill|directed, would lo&s;e their influence. 3dly, This branch of our nature, is the corner-&s;tone of the criminal law. Did not a man think him&s;elf ac|countable to all the world, and to his judge in a peculiar manner, it would be natural for him to think, that the ju&s;te&s;t &s;entence pronounced again&s;t him, is oppre&s;&s;ion, not ju&s;tice. 4thly, This branch is a &s;trong cement to &s;ociety. If we were not accountable beings, tho&s;e connected by blood, or by country, would be no le&s;s &s;hy and re&s;erved, than if they were mere &s;trangers to each other.</P>
<P>The final cau&s;e that next occurs, being &s;imple and obvious, is mentioned only that it may not &s;eem to have been overlooked. All right actions are agreeable, all wrong actions di&s;agreeable. This is a wi&s;e appointment of Providence. We meet with &s;o many temptations again&s;t duty, that it is not always an ea&s;y ta&s;k to per&s;evere in the right path: would we per&s;evere, were duty di&s;a|greeable? And were acts of pure benevolence di&s;agreeable, they would be extremely rare, however worthy of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Another final cau&s;e re&s;pects duty, in contradi&s;|tinction to pure benevolence. All the moral laws are founded on intuitive perception; and are &s;o &s;imple and plain, as to be perfectly apprehended
<PB N="53" REF="57">
by the mo&s;t ignorant. Were they in any degree complex or ob&s;cure, they would be perverted by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and prejudice. No conviction inferior to what is afforded by intuitive perception, could produce in mankind a common &s;en&s;e with re&s;pect to moral duties. Rea&s;on would afford no gene|ral conviction; becau&s;e that faculty is di&s;tributed in portions &s;o unequal, as to bar all hopes from it of uniformity either in practice or in opinion. At the &s;ame time, we are taught by woful expe|rience, that rea&s;on has little influence over the greater part of men. Rea&s;on, it is true, aided by experience, &s;upports morality, by convincing us, that we cannot be happy if we abandon du|ty for any other intere&s;t. But conviction &s;eldom weighs much again&s;t imperious pa&s;&s;ion; to con|trol which the vigorous and commanding princi|ple of duty is requi&s;ite, directed by the &s;hining light of intuition.</P>
<P>A propo&s;ition laid down above appears to be a &s;ort of my&s;tery in the moral &s;y&s;tem, viz. That though evidently all moral duties are contrived for promoting the general good, yet that choice is not permitted among different goods, or between good and ill; and that we are &s;trictly tied down to perform or forbear certain particular acts, without regard to con&s;equences; or, in other words, that we mu&s;t not do wrong, whatever good it may produce. The final cau&s;e, which I am about to unfold, will clear this my&s;tery, and &s;et the beauty of the moral &s;y&s;tem in a con&s;picu|ous light. I begin with ob&s;erving, that as the general good of mankind, or even of the &s;ociety we live in, re&s;ults from many and various cir|cum&s;tances intricately combined, it is far above the capacity of man, to judge in every in&s;tance what particular actions will tend the mo&s;t to that end. The authori&s;ing therefore a man to trace
<PB N="54" REF="58">
out his duty, by weighing endle&s;s circum&s;tances good and ill, would open a wide door to partiali|ty and pa&s;&s;ion, and often lead him unwittingly to prefer the preponderating ill, under a fal&s;e ap|pearance of being the greater good. At that rate, the opinions of men about right and wrong, would be as various as their faces; which, as ob&s;erved above, would totally unhinge &s;ociety. It is better ordered by Providence, even for the general good, that, avoiding complex and ob|&s;cure objects, we are directed by the moral &s;en&s;e to perform certain plain and &s;imple acts, which are obvious to us by intuitive perception.</P>
<P>In the next place, To permit ill in order to produce greater good, may &s;uit a being of uni|ver&s;al benevolence; but is repugnant to the na|ture of man, compo&s;ed of &s;elfi&s;h and benevolent principles. We have &s;een above, that the true moral balance depends on a &s;ubordination of &s;elf-love to duty, and of arbitrary benevolence to &s;elf-love; and accordingly every man is &s;en&s;ible of inju&s;tice when he is hurt in order to benefit another. Were it a rule in &s;ociety, That a grea|ter good to any other would make it an act of ju&s;tice to deprive me of my life, of my reputa|tion, or of my property, I &s;hould renounce the &s;ociety of men, and a&s;&s;ociate with more harmle&s;s animals.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The true moral &s;y&s;tem, that which is di&s;played above, is not only better &s;uited to the nature of man, and to his limited capacity and intelligence, but contributes more to the general good, which I now proceed to demon&s;trate. It would be lo&s;ing time to prove, that a man entire|ly &s;elfi&s;h is ill fitted for &s;ociety; and we have &s;een<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 4.</NOTE>, that univer&s;al benevolence, were it a
<PB N="55" REF="59">
duty, would contribute to the general good per|haps le&s;s than ab&s;olute &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. Man is too limited in capacity and in power for univer&s;al be|nevolence. Even the greate&s;t monarch has not power to exerci&s;e his benevolence but within a very &s;mall compa&s;s; and if &s;o, how unfit would &s;uch a duty be for private per&s;ons, who have ve|ry little power? Serving only to di&s;tre&s;s them by inability of performance, they would endeavour to &s;mother it altogether, and give full &s;cope to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. Man is much better qualified for do|ing good, by a con&s;titution in which benevolence is duly blended with &s;elf-love. Benevolence, as a duty, takes place of &s;elf-love; a regulation e&s;&s;ential to &s;ociety. Benevolence, as a virtue, not a duty, gives place to &s;elf-love; becau&s;e as every man has more power, knowledge and oppor|tunity, to promote his own good than that of others, a greater quantity of good is produced, than if benevolence were our only principle of action. This holds, even &s;uppo&s;ing no harm done to any per&s;on: much more would it hold, were we permitted to hurt &s;ome, in order to pro|duce more good to others.</P>
<P>The foregoing final cau&s;es re&s;pect morality in general. We now proceed to particulars; and the fir&s;t and mo&s;t important is the law of re|&s;traint. Man is evidently framed for &s;ociety: and as there can be no &s;ociety among creatures who prey upon each other, it was nece&s;&s;ary to provide again&s;t mutual injuries; which is effec|tually done by this law. Its nece&s;&s;ity with re|&s;pect to per&s;onal &s;ecurity is &s;elf-evident; and with re&s;pect to property, its nece&s;&s;ity will appear from what follows. In the nature of every man, there is a propen&s;ity to hoard or &s;tore up things u&s;eful to him&s;elf and family. But this natural propen&s;ity would be rendered ineffectual, were he
<PB N="56" REF="60">
not &s;ecured in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he thus &s;tores up; for no man will toil to accumulate what he cannot &s;ecurely po&s;&s;e&s;s. This &s;ecurity is afforded by the moral &s;en&s;e, which dictates, that the fir&s;t occupant of goods provided by nature for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of man, ought to be &s;ecure in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that &s;uch goods ought to be inviolable as his property. Thus, by the great law of re&s;traint, men have a protection for their goods, as well as for their per&s;ons; and are no le&s;s &s;ecure in &s;ociety, than if they were &s;eparated from each other by impregna|ble walls.</P>
<P>Several other duties are little le&s;s e&s;&s;ential than that of re&s;traint to the exi&s;tence of &s;ociety. Mutual tru&s;t and confidence, without which &s;ociety would be an uncomfortable &s;tate, enter into the cha|racter of the human &s;pecies; to which the duties of veracity and fidelity corre&s;pond. The final cau&s;e of the&s;e corre&s;ponding duties, is obvious: the latter would be of no u&s;e in &s;ociety without the former; and the former, without the latter, would be hurtful, by laying men open to fraud and deceit.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to veracity in particular, man is &s;o con&s;tituted, that he mu&s;t be indebted to infor|mation for the knowledge of mo&s;t things that be|nefit or hurt him; and if he could not depend upon information, &s;ociety would be very little beneficial. Further, it is wi&s;ely ordered, that we &s;hould be bound by the moral &s;en&s;e always to &s;peak truth, even where we perceive no harm in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing that duty; becau&s;e it is &s;ufficient that harm may en&s;ue, though not fore&s;een. At the &s;ame time, fal&s;ehood always does mi&s;chief: it may happen not to injure us externally in our reputation, or in our goods: but it never fails to injure us internally; for one great ble&s;&s;ing of &s;o|ciety
<PB N="57" REF="61">
is, a candid intercour&s;e of &s;entiments, of opinions, of de&s;ires, of wi&s;hes; and to admit any fal&s;ehood in &s;uch intercour&s;e, would poi&s;on the mo&s;t refined plea&s;ures of life.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e man is the weake&s;t of all animals in a &s;tate of &s;eparation; and the very &s;tronge&s;t in &s;o|ciety, by mutual aid and &s;upport to which cove|nants and promi&s;es greatly contribute, the&s;e are made binding by the moral &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The final cau&s;e of the law of propriety, which enforces the duty we owe to our&s;elves, comes next in order. In di&s;cour&s;ing upon tho&s;e laws of na|ture which concern &s;ociety, there is no occa&s;ion to mention any &s;elf-duty but what relates to &s;o|ciety; of which kind are prudence, temperance, indu&s;try, firmne&s;s of mind. And that &s;uch qua|lities &s;hould be made our duty, is wi&s;ely ordered in a double re&s;pect; fir&s;t, as qualifying us to act a proper part in &s;ociety, and next, as intitling us to good-will from others. It is the intere&s;t, no doubt, of every man, to &s;uit his behaviour to the dignity of his nature, and to the &s;tation allot|ted him by Providence; for &s;uch rational conduct contributes to happine&s;s, by pre&s;erving health, procuring plenty, gaining the e&s;teem of others, and, which of all is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, by gain|ing a ju&s;tly-founded &s;elf-e&s;teem. But here inte|re&s;t &s;olely is not relied on: the powerful autho|rity of duty is added, that in a matter of the ut|mo&s;t importance to our&s;elves, and of &s;ome im|portance to the &s;ociety we live in, our conduct may be regular and &s;teady. The&s;e duties tend not only to render a man happy in him&s;elf, but al&s;o, by procuring the good-will and e&s;teem of others, to command their aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in time of need.</P>
<P>I proceed to the final cau&s;es of natural rewards and puni&s;hments. It is laid down above, that
<PB N="58" REF="62">
controver&s;ies about property and about other mat|ters of intere&s;t, mu&s;t be adju&s;ted by the &s;tandard of right and wrong. But to bring rewards and puni&s;hments under the &s;ame &s;tandard, with|out regard to private con&s;cience, would be a plan unworthy of our Maker. It is extremely clear, that to reward one who is not con&s;cious of merit, or to puni&s;h one who is not con&s;cious of guilt, cannot an&s;wer any good end; and in particular, can|not tend either to improvement or to reformation of manners. How much more like the Deity is the plan of nature, which rewards no man who is not con&s;cious that he merits reward, and puni&s;hes no man who is not con&s;cious that he merits pun|i&s;hment! By that plan, and by that only, re|wards and puni&s;hments accompli&s;h every good end; a final cau&s;e mo&s;t illu&s;trious! The rewards and puni&s;hments that attend the primary and &s;e|condary virtues, are finely contrived for &s;upport|ing the di&s;tinction between them, &s;et forth above. Puni&s;hment mu&s;t be confined to the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of primary virtues, it being the intention of na|ture, that &s;econdary virtues be entirely free. On the other hand, &s;econdary virtues are more high|ly rewarded than primary: genero&s;ity, for exam|ple, makes a greater figure than ju&s;tice; and magnanimity, heroi&s;m, undaunted courage, a &s;till greater figure. One would imagine, at fir&s;t view, that primary virtues, being more e&s;&s;ential, &s;hould be intitled to the fir&s;t place in our e&s;teem, and be more amply rewarded than &s;econdary; and yet in elevating the latter above the former, pe|culiar wi&s;dom and fore&s;ight are con&s;picuous. Pu|ni&s;hment is appropriated to enforce primary vir|tues; and if the&s;e virtues were al&s;o attended with high rewards, &s;econdary virtues, degraded to a lower rank, would be deprived of that enthu|&s;ia&s;tic
<PB N="59" REF="63">
admiration which is their chief &s;upport: &s;elf-intere&s;t would univer&s;ally prevail over bene|volence, and bani&s;h tho&s;e numberle&s;s favours we receive from each other in &s;ociety, which are beneficial in point of intere&s;t, and &s;till more &s;o by generating affection and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>In our progre&s;s through final cau&s;es we come at la&s;t to reparation, one of the principles de&s;tin|ed by Providence for redre&s;&s;ing wrongs commit|ted, and for preventing the reiteration of them. The final cau&s;e of this principle, when the mi&s;chief ari&s;es from intention, is clear: for to protect individuals in &s;ociety, it is not &s;uf|ficient that the delinquent be puni&s;hed; it is nece&s;&s;ary over and above, that the mi&s;chief be re|paired.</P>
<P>Secondly, Where the act is wrong or unju&s;t, though not under&s;tood by the author to be &s;o, it is wi&s;ely ordered that reparation &s;hould follow; which will thus appear. Con&s;idering the fallibi|lity of man, it would be too &s;evere to permit ad|vantage to be taken of one's error in every cir|cum&s;tance. On the other hand, to make it a law in our nature, never to take advantage of er|ror, would be giving too much indulgence to in|dolence and remi&s;&s;ion of mind, tending to make us neglect the improvement of our rational fa|culties. Our nature is &s;o happily framed, as to avoid the&s;e extremes by di&s;tingui&s;hing between gain and lo&s;s. No man is con&s;cious of wrong, when he takes advantage of an error committed by another to &s;ave him&s;elf from lo&s;s: if there mu&s;t be a lo&s;s, common &s;en&s;e dictates, that it ought to re&s;t upon the per&s;on who has erred, however innocently, rather than upon the per&s;on who has not erred. Thus, in a competition among creditors about the e&s;tate of their bankrupt
<PB N="60" REF="64">
debtor, every one is at liberty to avail him&s;elf of every error committed by his competitor, in order to recover payment. But <HI>in lucro captando,</HI> the moral &s;en&s;e teacheth a different le&s;&s;on; which is, that no man ought to lay hold of another's error to make gain by it. Thus, an heir finding a rough diamond in the repo&s;itories of his ance&s;tor, gives it away, mi&s;taking it for a common pebble: the purcha&s;er is in con&s;cience and equity bound to re&s;tore, or to pay a ju&s;t price.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The following con&s;iderations unfold a final cau&s;e, no le&s;s beautiful than that la&s;t men|tioned. Society could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t in any tolerable manner, were full &s;cope given to ra&s;hne&s;s and ne|gligence, and to every action that is not &s;trictly criminal; whence it is a maxim founded no le&s;s upon utility than upon ju&s;tice, That men in &s;o|ciety ought to be extremely circum&s;pect, as to every action that may po&s;&s;ibly do harm. On the other hand, it is al&s;o a maxim, That as the pro&s;|perity and happine&s;s of man depend on action, activity ought to be encouraged, in&s;tead of be|ing di&s;couraged by dread of con&s;equences. The&s;e maxims, &s;eemingly in oppo&s;ition, have natural limits that prevent their encroaching upon each other. There is a certain degree of attention and circum&s;pection that men generally be&s;tow upon affairs, proportioned to their importance: if that degree were not &s;ufficient to defend again&s;t a claim of reparation, individuals would be too much cramped in action; which would be a great di&s;couragement to activity: if a le&s;s degree were &s;ufficient, there would be too great &s;cope for ra&s;h or remi&s;s conduct; which would prove the bane of &s;ociety. The&s;e limits, which evidently tend to the good of &s;ociety, are adju&s;ted by the moral &s;en&s;e; which dictates, as laid down in the &s;ection of Reparation, that the man who acts with fore|&s;ight
<PB N="61" REF="65">
of the probability of mi&s;chief, or acts ra&s;hly and uncautiou&s;ly without &s;uch fore&s;ight, ought to be liable for con&s;equences; but that the man who acts cautiou&s;ly, without fore&s;eeing or &s;u&s;|pecting any mi&s;chief, ought not to be liable for con&s;equences.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame &s;ection it is laid down, that the moral &s;en&s;e requires from every man, not his own degree of vigilance and attention, which may be very &s;mall, but that which belongs to the com|mon nature of the &s;pecies. The final cau&s;e of that regulation will appear upon con&s;idering, that were reparation to depend upon per&s;onal circum|&s;tances, there would be a nece&s;&s;ity of enquiring into the characters of men, their education, their manner of living, and the extent of their under|&s;tanding; which would render judges arbitrary, and &s;uch law-&s;uits inextricable. But by a&s;|&s;uming the common nature of the &s;pecies as a &s;tandard, by which every man in con&s;ci|ence judges of his own actions, law-&s;uits about reparation are rendered ea&s;y and expediti|ous.</P>

<P>HAVING, in the foregoing &s;ections, a&s;cer|tained the reality of a moral &s;en&s;e, with its &s;entiments of approbation and di&s;approbation,
<PB N="62" REF="66">
prai&s;e and blame; the purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent &s;ec|tion is, to &s;hew, that the&s;e &s;entiments are con|&s;i&s;tent with the laws that govern the actions of man as a rational being. In order to which it is fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to explain the&s;e laws; for there has been much controver&s;y about them, e&s;pecially among divines of the Arminian and Calvini&s;t &s;ects.</P>
<P>Human actions, as laid down in the fir&s;t &s;ec|tion, are of three kinds: one, where we act by in&s;tinct, without any view to con&s;equences; one, where we act by will in order to produce &s;ome effect; and one, where we act again&s;t will. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, the agent acts blindly, without deliberation or choice; and the external act follows nece&s;&s;arily from the in&s;tinctive im|plu&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;tonechatter makes its ne&s;t on the ground or near it; and the young, as &s;oon as they can &s;hift for them&s;elves, leave the ne&s;t in&s;tinctivly. An egg of that bird was laid in a &s;wallow's ne&s;t, fixed to the roof of a church. The &s;wallow fed all the young equally with|out di&s;tinction. The young &s;tonechatter left the ne&s;t at the u&s;ual time before it could fly; and falling to the ground, it was taken up dead. Here is in&s;tinct in pu|rity, exerting it&s;elf blindly without regard to variation of circum&s;tances. The &s;ame is ob&s;ervable in our dunghill-fowl. They feed on worms, corn, and other feeds dropt on the ground. In order to di&s;cover their food, nature has provided them with an in&s;tinct to &s;crape with the foot; and the in&s;tinct is &s;o regularly exerci&s;ed, that they &s;crape even when they are &s;et upon a heap of corn.</NOTE>. Actions done with a view to an end, are in a very different condition: in the&s;e, deliberati|on, choice, will, enter: the intention to accom|pli&s;h the end goes fir&s;t; the will to act in order to accompli&s;h the end is next; and the external
<PB N="63" REF="67">
act follows of cour&s;e. It is the will then that governs every action done as means to an end; and it is de&s;ire to accompli&s;h the end that puts the will in motion; de&s;ire in this view being com|monly termed the <HI>motive</HI> to act. Thus, hearing that my friend is in the hands of robbers, I burn with de&s;ire to free him: de&s;ire influen|ces my will to arm my &s;ervants, and to fly to his relief. Actions done again&s;t will come in afterward.</P>
<P>But what is it that rai&s;es de&s;ire? The an&s;wer is at hand: it is the pro&s;pect of attaining &s;ome agree|able end, or of avoiding one that is di&s;agreeable. And if it be again enquired, What makes an object agreeable or di&s;agreeable, the an&s;wer is equally ready, that our nature makes it &s;o; and more we cannot &s;ay. Certain vi&s;ible objects are agreeable, certain &s;ounds, and certain &s;mells: other objects of the&s;e &s;en&s;es are di&s;agreeable. But there we mu&s;t &s;top; for we are far from being &s;o intimately acquainted with our own na|ture as to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;es. The&s;e hints are &s;uf|ficient for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e: if one be curious to know more, the theory of de&s;ire, and of agree|ablene&s;s and di&s;agreeablene&s;s, will be found in Ele|ments of Critici&s;m<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to in&s;tinctive actions, no per&s;on, I pre&s;ume, thinks that there is any freedom, more than in acts done again&s;t will: an infant applies to the nipple, and a bird builds its ne&s;t, no le&s;s nece&s;&s;arily than a &s;tone falls to the ground. With re&s;pect to voluntary actions, &s;uch as are done with a view to an end, the nece&s;&s;ity is the &s;ame, though le&s;s apparent at fir&s;t view. The external
<PB N="64" REF="68">
action is determined by the will: the will is de|termined by de&s;ire: and de&s;ire by what is agreea|ble or di&s;agreeable. Here is a chain of cau&s;es and effects, not one link of which is arbitrary, or under command of the agent: he cannot will but according to his de&s;ire: he cannot de&s;ire but ac|cording to what is agreeable or di&s;agreeable in the objects perceived: nor do the&s;e qualities depend on his inclination or fancy; he has no power to make a beautiful woman ugly, nor to make a rotten carca&s;e &s;weet.</P>
<P>Many good men apprehending danger to mora|lity from holding our actions to be nece&s;&s;ary, en|deavour to break the chain of cau&s;es and effects above mentioned, maintaining, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That whatever influence de&s;ire or motives may have, it is the agent him&s;elf who is the cau&s;e of every acti|on; that de&s;ire may advi&s;e, but cannot com|mand; and therefore that a man is &s;till free to act in contradiction to de&s;ire and to the &s;trong|e&s;t motives."</Q> That a being may exi&s;t, which in every ca&s;e acts blindly and arbitrarily, without having any end in view, I can make a &s;hift to conceive: but it is difficult for me even to imagine a thinking and rational being, that has affections and pa&s;&s;ions, that has a de&s;ireable end in view, that can ea&s;ily accompli&s;h this end; and yet, after all, can fly off, or remain at re&s;t, without any cau&s;e, rea&s;on, or motive, to &s;way it. If &s;uch a whim&s;ical being can po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t, I am certain that man is not &s;uch a being. There is perhaps not a per&s;on above the condition of a changeling, but can &s;ay why he did &s;o and &s;o, what moved him, what he intended. Nor is a &s;ingle fact &s;tated to make us believe, that ever a man acted again&s;t his own will or de&s;ire, who was not compelled by external violence. On the con|trary, con&s;tant and univer&s;al experience proves,
<PB N="65" REF="69">
that human actions are governed by certain in|flexible laws; and that a man cannot exert his &s;elf-motive power, but in pur&s;uance of &s;ome de|&s;ire or motive.</P>
<P>Had a motive always the &s;ame influence, acti|ons proceeding from it would appear no le&s;s ne|ce&s;&s;ary than the actions of matter. The various degrees of influence that motives have on dif|ferent men at the &s;ame time, and on the &s;ame man at different times, occa&s;ion a doubt by &s;ugge&s;ting a notion of chance. Some motives however have &s;uch influence, as to leave no doubt: a timid female has a phy&s;ical power to throw her&s;elf into the mouth of a lion, roaring for food; but &s;he is with-held by terror no le&s;s effectually than by cords: if &s;he &s;hould ru&s;h upon the lion, would not every one conclude that &s;he was frantic? A man, though in a deep &s;leep, retains a phy&s;ical power to act, but he cannot exert it. A man, though de&s;perately in love, retains a phy&s;ical power to refu&s;e the hand of his mi&s;tre&s;s; but he cannot exert that power in contradiction to his own ardent de&s;ire, more than if he were fa&s;t a&s;leep. Now if a &s;trong motive have a nece&s;&s;ary influence, there is no rea&s;on for doubting, but that a weak motive mu&s;t al&s;o have its influence, the &s;ame in kind, though not in degree. Some actions indeed are &s;trangely irregular; but let the wilde&s;t action be &s;crutinized, there will always be di&s;covered &s;ome motive or de&s;ire, which, however whim&s;ical or capricious, was what influenced the per&s;on to act. Of two con|tending motives is it not natural to expect, that the &s;tronger will prevail, however little its exce&s;s may be? If there be any doubt, it mu&s;t be from a &s;uppo&s;ition that a weak motive can be re&s;i&s;ted arbitrarily. Where then are we to fix the boun|dary between a weak and a &s;trong motive? If a
<PB N="66" REF="70">
weak motive can be re&s;i&s;ted, why not one a lit|tle &s;tronger, and why not the &s;tronge&s;t? In Ele|ments of Critici&s;m<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 4.</NOTE> the reader will find many examples of contrary motives weighing again&s;t each other. Let him ponder the&s;e with the &s;tricte&s;t attention: his conclu&s;ion will be, that between two motives, however nearly balanced, a man has not an arbitrary choice, but mu&s;t yield to the &s;tronger. The mind indeed fluctuates for &s;ome time, and feels it&s;elf in a mea&s;ure loo&s;e: at la&s;t, however, it is determined by the more pow|erful motive, as a balance is by the greater weight after many vibrations.</P>
<P>Such then are the laws that govern our volun|tary actions. A man is ab&s;olutely free to act oc|cording to his own will; greater freedom than which is not conceivable. At the &s;ame time, as man is made accountable for his conduct, to his Maker, to his fellow-creatures, and to him&s;elf, he is not left to act arbitrarily; for at that rate he would be altogether unaccountable: his will is regulated by de&s;ire; and de&s;ire by what plea|&s;es or di&s;plea&s;es him. Where we are &s;ubjected to the will of another, would it be our wi&s;h, that his will &s;hould be under no regulation? And where we are guided by our own will, would it be rea&s;onable to wi&s;h, that it &s;hould be under no regulation, but be exerted without rea&s;on, with|out any motive, and contrary to common &s;en&s;e? Thus, with regard to human conduct, there is a chain of laws e&s;tabli&s;hed by nature, not one link of which is left arbitrary. By that wi&s;e &s;y&s;tem, man is rendered accountable: by it, he is made a fit &s;ubject for divine and human government: by it, per&s;ons of &s;agacity fore&s;ee the conduct of
<PB N="67" REF="71">
others: and by it, the pre&s;cience of the Deity with re&s;pect to human actions, is firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urd figure men would make if they could act contrary to motives, &s;hould be &s;uffici|ent, one may think, to open our eyes without an argument. What a de&s;picable figure does a per|&s;on make, upon whom the &s;ame motive has great influence at one time, and very little at another? He is a bad member of &s;ociety, and cannot be relied on as a friend or as an a&s;&s;ociate. But how highly rational is this &s;uppo&s;ed per&s;on, compared with one who can act in contradiction to every motive? The former may be termed whim&s;ical or capricious: the latter is wor&s;e; he is ab&s;o|lutely unaccountable, and cannot be the &s;ubject of government, more than a lump of matter un|con&s;cious of its own motion.</P>
<P>Let the faculty of acting be compared with that of rea&s;oning: the compari&s;on will tend to &s;often our reluctance to the nece&s;&s;ary influence of motives. A man &s;ometimes blunders in rea&s;o|ning; but he is tied by his nature, to form con|clu&s;ions upon what appears to him true at the time. If he could arbitrarily form a different conclu&s;ion, what an ab&s;urd rea&s;oner would he be! Would a man be le&s;s ab&s;urd, if he had a power of acting again&s;t motives, and contrary to what he thinks right or eligible? To act in that man|ner, is incon&s;i&s;tent with any notion we can form of a &s;en&s;ible being. Nor do we &s;uppo&s;e that man is &s;uch a being: in accounting for any acti|on, however whim&s;ical, we always a&s;cribe it to &s;ome motive, never once dreaming that there was no motive.</P>
<P>And after all, where would be the advantage of &s;uch an arbitrary power? Can a rational man wi&s;h &s;eriou&s;ly to have &s;uch a power? or can he
<PB N="68" REF="72">
&s;eriou&s;ly think, that God would make man &s;o whim&s;ical a being? To endue man with a de|gree of &s;elf-command &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t every vicious motive, without any power to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e that are virtuous, would indeed be a gift of va|lue; but too great for man, becau&s;e it would ex|alt him to be an angel. But &s;uch &s;elf-command as to re&s;i&s;t both equally, which is the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, would unqualify us for being go|verned either by God or by man. Better far to be led as rational creatures by the pro&s;pect of good, however erroneous our judgment may &s;ometimes be.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that man is the only terre&s;trial be|ing formed to know his Maker, and to wor&s;hip him, will it not &s;ound har&s;hly, while all other animals are &s;ubjected to divine government, and unerringly fulfil their de&s;tination, that man alone &s;hould be withdrawn from divine government, and be &s;o framed, that neither his Maker, nor he him&s;elf, can fore&s;ee what he will do the next moment? The power of re&s;i&s;ting the &s;tronge&s;t motives, whether of religion or of morality, would render him independent of the Deity.</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning is too diffu&s;e: may it not be comprehended in a &s;ingle view? it will make the deeper impre&s;&s;ion. There may be conceived different &s;y&s;tems for governing man as a thinking and rational being. One is, That virtuous mo|tives &s;hould always prevail over every other mo|tive. This, in appearance, would be the mo&s;t perfect government. But man is not &s;o con&s;titu|ted: and there is rea&s;on to doubt, whether &s;uch perfection would in his pre&s;ent &s;tate corre&s;pond to the other branches of his nature<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See book 2. &s;ketch 1. at the end.</NOTE>. Ano|ther
<PB N="69" REF="73">
&s;y&s;tem is, That virtuous motives &s;ometimes prevail, &s;ometimes vicious; and that we are al|ways determined by the prevailing motive. This is the true &s;y&s;tem of nature; and hence great va|riety of character and of conduct among men. A third &s;y&s;tem is, That motives have influence; but that one can act in contradiction to every motive. This is the &s;y&s;tem I have been combat|ing. Ob&s;erve only what it re&s;olves into. How is an action to be accounted for that is done in contradiction to every motive? It wanders from the region of common &s;en&s;e into that of mere chance. If &s;uch were the nature of man, no one could rely on another: a promi&s;e or an oath would be a rope of &s;and: the utmo&s;t cordiality between my friend and me, would be no &s;ecurity again&s;t his &s;tabbing me with the fir&s;t weapon that comes in his way. Would any man wi&s;h to have been formed according to &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem? He would probably wi&s;h to have been formed according to the &s;y&s;tem fir&s;t mentioned: but that is denied him, virtuous motives &s;ometimes pre|vailing, &s;ometimes vicious; and from the wi&s;|dom of Providence we have rea&s;on to believe, that this law is of all the be&s;t fitted for man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>To conclude this branch of the &s;ubject: In none of the works of Providence, &s;o far as we can penetrate, is there di&s;played a deeper reach of art and wi&s;dom, than in the laws of action peculiar to man as a thinking and rational being. Were he left loo&s;e, to act in contradiction to motives, there would be no place for prudence, fore&s;ight, nor for adju&s;ting means to an end: it could not be fore&s;een by others what a man will do the next hour; nay it could not be fore&s;een, even by him&s;elf. Man would not be capable of rewards and puni&s;hments: he would not be fit|ted,
<PB N="70" REF="74">
either for divine or for human government: he would be a creature that has no re&s;emblance to the human race. But man is not left loo&s;e; for though he is at liberty to act according to his own will, yet his will is regulated by de&s;ire, and de&s;ire by what plea&s;es and di&s;plea&s;es. This con|nection pre&s;erves uniformity of conduct, and confines human actions within the great chain of cau&s;es and effects. By this admirable &s;y&s;tem, liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, &s;eemingly incompatible, are made perfectly concordant, fitting us for &s;ociety, and for government both human and divine.</P>
<P>Having explained the laws that govern human actions, we proceed to what is chiefly intended in the pre&s;ent &s;ection, which is, to examine, how far the moral &s;entiments handled in the foregoing &s;ections are con&s;i&s;tent with the&s;e laws. Let it be kept in view, that our moral &s;entiments and feel|ings are founded entirely upon the moral &s;en&s;e; which unfolds to us a right and a wrong in acti|ons. From the &s;ame &s;en&s;e are derived the &s;en|timents of approbation and prai&s;e when a man does right, and of di&s;approbation and blame when he does wrong. Were we de&s;titute of the moral &s;en&s;e, right and wrong, prai&s;e and blame, would be as little under&s;tood as colours are by one born blind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In an intricate &s;ubject like the pre&s;ent, great care &s;hould be taken to avoid ambiguities. The term <HI>prai&s;e</HI> has two different &s;ignifications: in one &s;en&s;e it is op|po&s;ed to <HI>blame;</HI> in another to <HI>di&s;prai&s;e.</HI> In the for|mer &s;en&s;e it expre&s;&s;es a moral &s;entiment: in the latter, it expre&s;&s;es only the approving any object that plea&s;es me. I prai&s;e one man for his candour, and blame another for being a double-dealer. The&s;e, both of them, imply will and intention. I prai&s;e a man for being acute; but for being dull, I only di&s;prai&s;e him. I prai&s;e a woman for beauty; but blame not any for ugline&s;s, I only di&s;prai&s;e them. None of the&s;e parti|culars imply will or intention.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="75">
The formidable argument that is urged, to prove that our moral &s;entiments are incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary influence of motives, is what follows. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If motives have a nece&s;&s;ary influence on our actions, there can be no good rea&s;on to prai&s;e a man for doing right, nor to blame him for doing wrong. What foundati|on can there be, either for prai&s;e or blame, when it was not in a man's power to have acted otherwi&s;e? A man commits murder in|&s;tigated by a &s;udden fit of revenge: why &s;hould he be puni&s;hed, if he acted nece&s;&s;ari|ly, and could not re&s;i&s;t the violence of the pa&s;&s;ion?"</Q> Here it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that a power of re&s;i&s;tance is e&s;&s;ential to prai&s;e and blame. But upon examination it will be found, that this &s;uppo&s;ition has not any &s;upport in the moral &s;en&s;e, nor in rea&s;on, nor in the common &s;en&s;e of man|kind.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, the moral &s;en&s;e, as we have &s;een above, places innocence and guilt, and con&s;equentty prai&s;e and blame, entirely upon will and intention. The connection between the motive and the action, &s;o far from dimini&s;hing, enhances the prai&s;e or blame. The greater in|fluence a virtuous motive has, the greater is the virtue of the agent, and the more warm our prai&s;e. On the other hand, the greater influ|ence a vicious motive has, the greater is the vice of the agent, and the more violently do we blame him. As this is the cardinal point, I wi&s;h to have it con&s;idered in a general view. It is e&s;&s;en|tial
<PB N="72" REF="76">
both to human and divine government, that the influence of motives &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. It is equally e&s;&s;ential, that that nece&s;&s;ary influence &s;hould not have the effect to le&s;&s;en guilt in the e&s;timation of men. To fulfil both ends, guilt is placed by the moral &s;en&s;e entirely upon will and intention: a man accordingly blames him&s;elf for doing mi&s;chief willingly and intentionally, with|out once con&s;idering whether he acted nece&s;&s;arily or not. And his &s;entiments are adopted by all the world: they pronounce the &s;ame &s;entence of condemnation that he him&s;elf does. A man put to the torture, yields to the pain, and with bit|ter reluctance reveals the &s;ecrets of his party: another does the &s;ame, yielding to a tempting bribe. The latter only is blamed as guilty of a crime; and yet the bribe perhaps operated as &s;trongly on the latter, as torture did on the for|mer. But the one was compelled again&s;t his will to reveal the &s;ecrets of his party; and therefore is innocent: the other acted willingly, in order to procure a great &s;um of money; and therefore is guilty.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to rea&s;on, I ob&s;erve, that the argument I am combating is an appeal to a wrong tribunal: the moral &s;en&s;e is the only judge in this controver&s;y, not the faculty of rea&s;on. At the &s;ame time, I &s;hould have no fear of a &s;en|tence again&s;t me, were rea&s;on to be the judge. For would not rea&s;on dictate, that the le&s;s a man wavers about his duty; or, in other words, the le&s;s influence vicious motives have, the more prai&s;e-worthy he is; and the more blameable, the le&s;s influence virtuous motives have?</P>
<P>Nor are we led by common &s;en&s;e to differ from rea&s;on and the moral &s;en&s;e. A man commits murder, overcome by a &s;udden fit of revenge which he could not re&s;i&s;t; will not one be led to
<PB N="73" REF="77">
reflect, even at fir&s;t view, that the man did not wi&s;h to re&s;i&s;t? on the contrary, that he would have committed the murder, though he had not been under any nece&s;&s;ity? A per&s;on of plain un|der&s;tanding will &s;ay, What &s;ignifies it whether the criminal could re&s;i&s;t or not, when he commit|ted the murder wittingly and willingly? A man gives poi&s;on privately out of revenge. Does any one doubt of his guilt, when he never once re|pented; though after admini&s;tering the poi&s;on it no longer was in his power to draw back? A man may be guilty and blame-worthy, even where there is external compul&s;ion that he cannot re&s;i&s;t. With &s;word in hand I run to attack an enemy: my foot &s;lipping, I fall headlong upon him, and by that accident the &s;word is pu&s;hed into his body. The external act was not the effect of Will, but of accident: but my intention was to commit murder, and I am guilty. All men acknowledge, that the Deity is nece&s;&s;arily good. Does that cir|cum&s;tance detract from his prai&s;e in com|mon apprehen&s;ion? On the contrary, he me|rits from us the highe&s;t prai&s;e on that very ac|count.</P>
<P>It is commonly &s;aid, that there can be no virtue where there is no &s;truggle. Virtue, it is true, is be&s;t known from a &s;truggle: a man who has ne|ver met with a temptation, can be little confident of his virtue. But the ob&s;ervation taken in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e, is undoubtedly erroneous. A man, tempted to betray his tru&s;t, wavers; but, after much doubting, refu&s;es at la&s;t the bribe. Ano|ther he&s;itates not a moment, but rejects the bribe with di&s;dain: duty is ob&s;tinate, and will not &s;uf|fer him even to deliberate. Is there no virtue in the latter? Undoubtedly more than in the for|mer.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="78">
Upon the whole, it appears that prai&s;e and blame re&s;t ultimately upon the di&s;po&s;ition or frame of mind. Nor is it obvious, that a power to act again&s;t motives, could vary in any degree the&s;e moral &s;entiments. When a man commits a crime, let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he could have re&s;i&s;ted the prevailing motive. Why then did he not re&s;i&s;t, in&s;tead of bringing upon him&s;elf &s;hame and mi&s;ery? The an&s;wer mu&s;t be, for no other can be given, that his di&s;po&s;ition is vicious, and that he is a dete&s;table creature. Further, it is not a little difficult to conceive, how a man can re&s;i&s;t a prevailing motive, without having any thing in his mind that &s;hould engage him to re&s;i&s;t it. But letting that pa&s;s, I make the following &s;uppo&s;ition. A man is tempted by avarice to accept a bribe: if he re&s;i&s;t upon the principle of duty, he is led by the prevailing motive: if he re&s;i&s;t without having any rea&s;on or motive for re&s;i&s;ting, I can|not di&s;cover any merit in &s;uch re&s;i&s;tance: it &s;eems to re&s;olve into a matter of chance or acci|dent, whether he re&s;i&s;t or do not re&s;i&s;t. Where can the merit lie of re&s;i&s;ting a vicious motive, when re&s;i&s;tance happens by mere chance? and where the demerit of re&s;i&s;ting a virtuous motive, when it is owing to the &s;ame chance? If a man, actuated by no principle, good or bad, and having no end or purpo&s;e in view, &s;hould kill his neighbour, I &s;ee not that he would be more accountable, than if he had acted in his &s;leep, or were mad.</P>
<P>Human puni&s;hments are perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the nece&s;&s;ary influence of motives, without &s;uppo&s;ing a power to with&s;tand them. If it be urged, That a man ought not to be puni&s;hed for committing a crime when he could not re&s;i&s;t; the an&s;wer is, That as he committed the crime inten|tionally, and with his eyes open, he is guilty in
<PB N="75" REF="79">
his own opinion, and in the opinion of all men; and he ju&s;tly &s;uffers puni&s;hment, to prevent him or others from doing the like in time to come. The dread of puni&s;hment is a weight in the &s;cale on the &s;ide of virtue, to counterbalance vicious motives.</P>
<P>The final cau&s;e of this branch of our nature is admirable. If the nece&s;&s;ary influence of motives had the effect either to le&s;&s;en the merit of a virtu|ous action, or the demerit of a crime, morality would be totally unhinged. The mo&s;t virtuous action would of all be the lea&s;t worthy of prai&s;e; and the mo&s;t vicious be of all the lea&s;t worthy of blame. Nor would the evil &s;top there: in&s;tead of curbing inordinate pa&s;&s;ions, we &s;hould be encouraged to indulge them, as an excellent excu&s;e for doing wrong. Thus, the moral &s;en|timents of approbation and di&s;approbation, of prai&s;e and blame, are found perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the laws above mentioned that govern hu|man actions, without having recour&s;e to an ima|ginary power of acting again&s;t motives.</P>
<P>The only plau&s;ible objection I have met with again&s;t the foregoing theory, is the remor&s;e a man feels for a crime he &s;uddenly commits, and as &s;uddenly repents of. During a fit of bitter re|mor&s;e for having &s;lain my favourite &s;ervant in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, without ju&s;t provocation, I ac|cu&s;e my&s;elf for having given way to pa&s;&s;ion; and acknowledge that I could and ought to have re|&s;trained it. Here we find remor&s;e founded on a &s;y&s;tem directly oppo&s;ite to that above laid down; a &s;y&s;tem that acknowledges no nece&s;&s;ary connecti|on between an action and the motive that produ|ced it; but, on the contrary, &s;uppo&s;es that it is in a man's power to re&s;i&s;t his pa&s;&s;ion, and that he ought to re&s;i&s;t it. What &s;hall be &s;aid upon this point? Can a man be a nece&s;&s;ary agent, when he
<PB N="76" REF="80">
is con&s;cious of the contrary, and is &s;en&s;ible that he can act in contradiction to motives? This ob|jection is &s;trong in appearance; and would be in|vincible, were we not happily relieved of it by a doctrine laid down in Elements of Critici&s;m<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 5.</NOTE> concerning the irregular influence of pa&s;&s;ion on our opinions and &s;entiments. Upon examination, it will be found, that the pre&s;ent ca&s;e may be ad|ded to the many examples there given of this ir|regular influence. In a peevi&s;h fit, I take excep|tion at &s;ome &s;light word or ge&s;ture of my friend, which I interpret as if he doubted of my veracity. I am in&s;tantly in a flame: in vain he prote&s;ts that he had no meaning, for impatience will not &s;uffer me to li&s;ten. I bid him draw, which he does with reluctance; and before he is well prepared, I give him a mortal wound. Bitter remor&s;e and angui&s;h &s;ucceed in&s;tantly to rage. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What have I done? why did I not ab&s;tain? I was not mad, and yet I have murdered my innocent friend: there is the hand that did the horrid deed; why did not I rather turn it again&s;t my own heart?"</Q> Here every impre&s;&s;ion of nece&s;&s;ity vani&s;hes: my mind tells me that I was ab&s;olutely free, and that I ought to have &s;mothered my pa&s;|&s;ion. I put an oppo&s;ite ca&s;e. A brutal fellow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">eats me with great indignity, and proceeds even to a blow. My pa&s;&s;ion ri&s;es beyond the po&s;&s;ibili|ty of re&s;traint: I can &s;carce forbear &s;o long as to bid him draw; and that moment I &s;tab him to the heart. I am &s;orry for having been engaged with a ruffian, but have no contrition nor re|mor&s;e. In this ca&s;e, my &s;entiments are very dif|ferent from what they are in the other. I never
<PB N="77" REF="81">
once dream that I could have re&s;i&s;ted the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion: on the contrary, my thoughts and words are, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That fle&s;h and blood could not bear the affront; and that I mu&s;t have been branded for a coward, had I not done what I did."</Q> In reality, both the actions were equal|ly nece&s;&s;ary. Whence then opinions and &s;en|timents &s;o oppo&s;ite to each other? The irregular influence of pa&s;&s;ion on our opinions and &s;enti|ments, will &s;olve the que&s;tion. All violent pa&s;|&s;ions are prone to their own gratification. A man affected with deep remor&s;e abhors him&s;elf, and is odious in his own eyes; and it gratifies the pa&s;|&s;ion, to indulge the thought that his guilt is be|yond the po&s;&s;ibility of excu&s;e. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e accordingly, remor&s;e forces upon me a conviction that I might have re&s;trained my pa&s;&s;ion, and ought to have re&s;trained it. I will not give way to any excu&s;e; becau&s;e in a fit of remor&s;e it gives me pain to be excu&s;ed. In the other ca&s;e, there be|ing no remor&s;e, there is no di&s;gui&s;e; and things appear in their true light. To illu&s;trate this rea|&s;oning, I ob&s;erve, that pa&s;&s;ion warps my judg|ment of the actions of others, as well as of my own. Many examples are given in the chapter above quoted: join to the&s;e the following. My &s;ervant aiming at a partridge, happens to &s;hoot a favourite &s;paniel cro&s;&s;ing the way un&s;een. In|flamed with anger, I &s;torm at his ra&s;hne&s;s, pro|nounce him guilty, and will li&s;ten to no excu&s;e. When my pa&s;&s;ion is &s;pent, I become &s;en&s;ible that it was merely accidental, and that the man is ab|&s;olutely innocent. The nur&s;e overlays my only child, the long-expected heir to a great e&s;tate. It is with difficulty that I refrain from putting her to death: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The wretch has murdered my in|fant, and de&s;erves to be torn to pieces."</Q>
<PB N="78" REF="82">
When my pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ides, I &s;ee the matter in a very different light. The poor woman is incon|&s;olable, and can &s;carce believe that &s;he is inno|cent: &s;he bitterly reproaches her&s;elf for want of care and concern. But, upon cool reflection, both &s;he and I are &s;en&s;ible, that no per&s;on in &s;ound &s;leep has any &s;elf-command; and that we cannot be an&s;werable for any action of which we are not con&s;cious. Thus, upon the whole, we find, that any impre&s;&s;ion we may occa&s;ionally have of being able to act in contradiction to motives, is the re&s;ult of pa&s;&s;ion, not of &s;ound judg|ment.</P>
<P>The reader will ob&s;erve, that this &s;ection is co|pied from E&s;&s;ays on Morality and Natural Religi|on. The ground-work is the &s;ame: the alterati|ons are only in the &s;uper&s;tructure; and the &s;ub|ject is abridged in order to adapt it to its pre&s;ent place. Part of the abridgment was publi&s;hed in the &s;econd edition of the Principles of Equity.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Upon CHANCE and CONTINGENCY,</HEAD>
<P>I HOLD it to be an intuitive propo&s;ition, That the Deity is the primary cau&s;e of all things; that with con&s;ummate wi&s;dom he formed the great plan of government, which he carries on by laws &s;uited to the different natures of animate and inanimate beings; and that the&s;e laws, pro|duce a regular chain of cau&s;es and effects in the moral as well as the material world, admitting no events but what are comprehended in the original plan<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See E&s;&s;ays on Morality and Natural Religion, part 1. e&s;&s;ay 3.</NOTE>. Hence it clearly follows, that chance is excluded out of this world, that nothing can happen by accident, and that no event is arbitrary or contingent. This is the doctrine of the e&s;&s;ay quoted; and, in my apprehen&s;ion, well founded. But I cannot &s;ub&s;cribe to what follows, viz. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That we have an impre&s;&s;ion of chance and con|tingency, which con&s;equently mu&s;t be delu|&s;ive."</Q> I would not willingly admit any delu&s;i|on in the nature of man, where it is not made
<PB N="80" REF="84">
evident beyond contradiction; and I now &s;ee clearly, that the impre&s;&s;ion we have of chance and contingency, is not delu&s;ive, but perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the e&s;tabli&s;hed plan.</P>
<P>The explanation of chance and contingency in the &s;aid e&s;&s;ay, &s;hall be given in the author's own words, as a proper text to rea&s;on upon. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In our ordinary train of thinking, it is certain that all events appear not to us as nece&s;&s;ary. A multitude of events &s;eem to be under our power to cau&s;e or to prevent; and we readily make a di&s;tinction betwixt events that are <HI>nece&s;&s;ary, i. e.</HI> that mu&s;t be; and events that are <HI>contingent, i. e.</HI> that may be, or may not be. This di&s;tinction is void of truth: for all things that fall out either in the material or moral world, are, as we have &s;een, alike ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and alike the re&s;ult of fixed laws. Yet, whatever conviction a philo&s;opher may have of this, the di&s;tinction betwixt things nece&s;&s;ary and things contingent, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his common train of thought, as much as it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es the mo&s;t illiterate. We act univer&s;ally upon that di&s;tinction: nay it is in truth the cau&s;e of all the labour, care, and indu&s;try, of mankind. I illu&s;trate this doctrine by an example. Con&s;tant experience hath taught us, that death is a nece&s;&s;ary event. The hu|man frame is not made to la&s;t for ever in its pre&s;ent condition; and no man thinks of more than a temporary exi&s;tence upon this globe. But the particular time of our death appears a contingent event. However certain it be, that the time and manner of the death of each individual is determined by a train of preced|ing cau&s;es, and is no le&s;s fixed than the hour of the &s;un's ri&s;ing or &s;etting; yet no per|&s;on is affected by this doctrine. In the care
<PB N="81" REF="85">
of prolonging life, we are directed by the &s;up|po&s;ed contingency of the time of death, which, to a certain term of years, we con&s;ider as de|pending in a great mea&s;ure on our&s;elves, by caution again&s;t accidents, due u&s;e of food, exerci&s;e, &amp;c. The&s;e means are pro&s;ecuted with the &s;ame diligence as if there were in fact no nece&s;&s;ary train of cau&s;es to fix the pe|riod of life. In &s;hort, whoever attends to his own practical ideas, whoever reflects upon the meaning of the following words which occur in all languages, of things <HI>po&s;&s;ible, contingent, that are in our power to cau&s;e or prevent;</HI> whoever, I &s;ay, reflects upon the&s;e words, will clearly &s;ee, that they &s;ugge&s;t certain per|ceptions or notions repugnant to the doctrine above e&s;tabli&s;hed of univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ity."</Q></P>
<P>In order to &s;how that there is no repugnance, I begin with defining <HI>chance</HI> and <HI>contingency.</HI> The former is applied to events that have hap|pened; the latter to future events. When we &s;ay a thing has happened by <HI>chance,</HI> we do not mean that <HI>chance</HI> was the cau&s;e; for no per&s;on ever thought that <HI>chance</HI> is a thing that can act, and by acting produce events: we only mean, that we are ignorant of the cau&s;e, and that, for aught we &s;ee, it might have happened or not happened, or have happened differently. Aim|ing at a bird, I &s;hoot <HI>by chance</HI> a favourite &s;pa|niel: the meaning is not, that chance killed the dog, but that as to me the dog's death was acci|dental. With re&s;pect to contingency, future events that are variable, and the cau&s;e unknown, are &s;aid to be contingent; changes of the wea|ther, for example, whether it will be fro&s;t or thaw to-morrow, whether fair or foul. In a word, chance and contingency applied to events mean not that &s;uch events happen without any
<PB N="82" REF="86">
cau&s;e, but only that we are ignorant of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It appears to me clear, that there is no &s;uch thing in human nature as a &s;en&s;e of <HI>contingency;</HI> or, in other words, a &s;en&s;e that any thing hap|pens without a cau&s;e: &s;uch a &s;en&s;e would be gro&s;sly delu&s;ive. True it is indeed, that our &s;en&s;e of a cau&s;e is but cloudy and indi&s;tinct with re&s;pect to certain events. Events that happen re|gularly, &s;uch as &s;ummer and winter, ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the &s;un, give us a di&s;tinct impre&s;&s;ion of a cau&s;e. The impre&s;&s;ion is le&s;s di&s;tinct with re&s;pect to events le&s;s regular, &s;uch as alterations of the weather: and extremely indi&s;tinct with re&s;pect to events that &s;eldom happen, and that happen without any known cau&s;e. But with re|&s;pect to no event whatever does our &s;en&s;e of a cau&s;e vani&s;h altogether, and give place to a po|&s;itive &s;en&s;e of contingency, that is, a &s;en&s;e of things happening without a cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Chance and contingency thus explained, &s;ug|ge&s;t not any perception or notion repugnant to the doctrine of univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ity; for my igno|rance of a cau&s;e, does not, even in my own ap|prehen&s;ion, exclude a cau&s;e. De&s;cending to par|ticulars, I take the example mentioned in the text, viz. the uncertainty of the time of my death. Knowing that my life depends in &s;ome mea&s;ure on my&s;elf, I u&s;e all means to pre&s;erve it, by proper food, exerci&s;e, and care to prevent accidents. Nor is there any delu&s;ion here. I am moved to u&s;e the&s;e means by the de&s;ire I have to live: the&s;e means accordingly prove effectual to carry on my pre&s;ent exi&s;tence to the oppointed period; and in that view are &s;o many links in the great chain of cau&s;es and effects.

<HEAD>PROGRESS of MORALITY.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING unfolded the principles of morali|ty, the next &s;tep is to trace out its gradu|al progre&s;s from its infancy among &s;avages, to its maturity among poli&s;hed nations. The hi&s;to|ry of opinions concerning the foundation of mo|rality, falls not within my plan; and I am glad to be relieved from an article that is executed in perfection by more able hands<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dr Cudworth and Dr Smith.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>An animal is brought forth with every one of its external members; and completes its growth, not by production of any new member, but by addition of matter to tho&s;e originally formed. The &s;ame holds with re&s;pect to internal members; the &s;en&s;es, for example, in&s;tincts, powers and faculties, principles and propen&s;ities: the&s;e are coeval with the individual, and are gradually un|folded, &s;ome early, &s;ome late. The external &s;en&s;es, being nece&s;&s;ary for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, &s;oon arrive at maturity. Some internal &s;en&s;es, of or|der for in&s;tance, of propriety, of dignity, being
<PB N="85" REF="89">
of no u&s;e during infancy, are not only &s;low in their progre&s;s toward maturity, but require much culture. Among &s;avages they are &s;carce perceptible.</P>
<P>The moral &s;en&s;e, in its progre&s;s, differs from tho&s;e la&s;t mentioned: it is frequently di&s;covered, even in childhood. It is however &s;low of growth, and &s;eldom arrives at perfection without culture and experience.</P>
<P>The moral &s;en&s;e not only ripens gradually with the other internal &s;en&s;es mentioned, but from them acquires force and additional authority: a &s;avage makes no difficulty to kill an enemy in cold blood: bloody &s;cenes are familiar to him, and his moral &s;en&s;e is not &s;ufficiently vigorous to give him compunction. The action appears in a different light to a per&s;on who has more delica|cy of feeling; and accordingly the moral &s;en&s;e has much more authority over tho&s;e who have received a refined education, than over &s;avages.</P>
<P>It is plea&s;ant to trace the progre&s;s of morality in members of a poli&s;hed nation. Objects of ex|ternal &s;en&s;e make the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions; and from them are derived a &s;tock of &s;imple ideas. Affec|tion, accompanying ideas, is fir&s;t directed to par|ticular objects, &s;uch as my brother, my wi&s;e, my friend. The mind opening by degrees, takes in complex objects, &s;uch as my country, my reli|gion, the government under which I live; and the&s;e al&s;o become objects of affection. Our con|nections multiply, and the moral &s;en&s;e gaining &s;trength as the mind opens, regulates our duty to each of them. Objects of hatred multiply, as well as objects of affection, and give full &s;cope to di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions, the mo&s;t formidable antagoni&s;ts that morality has to encounter. But nature hath provided a remedy: the per&s;on who indulges malice or revenge, is commonly the
<PB N="86" REF="90">
greate&s;t &s;ufferer by the indulgence: men become wi&s;e by experience, and have more peace and &s;atisfaction in fo&s;tering kindly affection: &s;tormy pa&s;&s;ions are &s;ubdued, or brought under rigid di&s;|cipline; and benevolence triumphs over &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s. We refine upon the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety: we learn to &s;ubmit our opinions: we affect to give preference to others; and readily fall in with whatever &s;weetens &s;ocial intercour&s;e: we care|fully avoid cau&s;es of di&s;cord; and overlooking trifling offences, we are &s;atisfied with moderate reparation, even for gro&s;s injuries.</P>
<P>A nation from its original &s;avage &s;tate, grows to maturity like the individuals above de&s;cribed; and the progre&s;s of morality is the &s;ame in both. The &s;avage &s;tate is the infancy of a nation, dur|ing which the moral &s;en&s;e is feeble, yielding to cu&s;tom, to imitation, to pa&s;&s;ion. But a nation, like a member of a poli&s;hed &s;ociety, ripens gra|dually, and acquires a ta&s;te in the fine arts, with acutene&s;s of &s;en&s;e in matters of right and wrong. Hatred and revenge, the great ob&s;tacles to moral duty, raged without control, while the privilege of avenging wrongs was permitted to individu|als<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 1.</NOTE>. But hatred and revenge yielding gradu|ally to the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, and to the grow|ing authority of the moral &s;en&s;e; and benevolent affections prevailed over di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions. In that comfortable period, we hear no more of cru|elty as a national character: on the contrary, the aver&s;ion we have to an enemy, is even in war ex|erci&s;ed with moderation. Nor do the &s;tormy pa&s;&s;ions ever again revive; for after a nation be|gins to decline from its meridian height, the pa&s;|&s;ions
<PB N="87" REF="91">
that prevail are not of the violent kind, but &s;elfi&s;h, timorous, and deceitful.</P>
<P>Morality however has not to this day arrived to &s;uch maturity as to operate between nations with equal &s;teadine&s;s and vigour as between indi|viduals. Ought this to be regretted as an im|perfection in our nature? I think not: had we the &s;ame compunction of heart for injuring a nation as for injuring an individual, and were inju&s;tice equally blameable as to both, war would cea&s;e, and a golden age en&s;ue; than which a greater misfortune could not befal the human race<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 2. Sketch 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s from maturity to a declining &s;tate, a nation differs widely from an individual. Old age puts an end to the latter: there are ma|ny cau&s;es that weaken the former; but old age is none of them, if it be not in a metaphorical &s;en&s;e. Riches, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and luxury, are the di&s;ea&s;es that weaken pro&s;perous nations: the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, following each other in a train, corrupt the heart, dethrone the moral &s;en&s;e, and make an anarchy in the &s;oul: men &s;tick at no expence to purcha&s;e plea&s;ure; and they &s;tick at no vice to &s;upply that expence.</P>
<P>Such are the outlines of morality in its pro|gre&s;s from birth to burial; and the&s;e outlines I propo&s;e to fill up with an induction of particu|lars. Looking back to the commencement of ci|vil &s;ociety, when no wants were known but tho&s;e of nature, and when &s;uch wants were amply pro|vided for; we find individuals of the &s;ame tribe living innocently and cordially together: they had no irregular appetites, nor any ground of &s;trife.
<PB N="88" REF="92">
In that &s;tate, moral principles joined their influ|ence with that of national affection, to &s;ecure individuals from harm. Savages accordingly, who have plenty of food, and are &s;imple in ha|bitation and clothing, &s;eldom tran&s;gre&s;s the rules of morality within their own tribe. Diodorus Siculus, who compo&s;ed his hi&s;tory recently after Cae&s;ar's expedition into Britain, &s;ays, that the inhabitants dwelt in mean Cottages covered with reeds or &s;ticks; that they were of much &s;incerity and integrity, contented with plain and homely fare; and were &s;trangers to the exce&s;s and lux|ury of rich men. In Friezeland, in Holland, and in other maritime provinces of the Nether|lands, locks and keys were unknown, till the in|habitants became rich by commerce: they con|tented them&s;elves with bare nece&s;&s;aries, which every one had in plenty. The Laplanders have no notion of theft. When they make an excur|&s;ion into Norway, which is performed in the &s;ummer months, they leave their huts open, without fear that any thing will be purloined. Formerly, they were entirely upright in their only commerce, that of bartering the &s;kins of wild bea&s;ts for tobacco, brandy, and coar&s;e cloth. But being often cheated by &s;trangers, they begin to more cunning. Crantz, de&s;cribing the inha|bitants of Iceland before they were corrupted by commerce with &s;trangers, &s;ays, that they lived under the &s;ame roof with their cattle; that eve|ry thing was common among them except their wives and children; and that they were &s;imple in their manners, having no appetite but for what nature requires. In the reign of Edwin King of Northumberland, a child, as hi&s;torians report, might have travelled with a pur&s;e of gold, with|out hazard of robbery: in our days of luxury, want is &s;o intolerable, that even fear of death is
<PB N="89" REF="93">
not &s;ufficient to deter us. All travellers agree, that the native Canadians are perfectly di&s;inter|e&s;ted, abhorring deceit and lying. The Califor|nians are fond of iron and &s;harp in&s;truments; and yet are &s;o &s;trictly hone&s;t, that carpenter-tools left open during night, were &s;afe. The &s;a|vages of North America had no locks for their goods: they probably have learned from Euro|peans, to be more circum&s;pect. Procopius bears te&s;timony<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toria Gothica, lib. 3.</NOTE>, that the Sclavi, like the Huns, were innocent people, free of all malice. Plan Carpin, the Pope's amba&s;&s;ador to the Cham of Tartary, ann. 1246, &s;ays, that the Tartars are not addicted to thieving; and that they leave their goods open without a lock. Nicholas Da|ma&s;cenus reports the &s;ame of the Celtae. The original inhabitants of the i&s;land Borneo, expel|led by the Mahometans from the &s;ea-coa&s;t to the center of the country, are hone&s;t, indu&s;trious, and kindly to each other: they have &s;ome notion of property, but not &s;uch as to render them co|vetous. Pagans in Siberia are numerous; and, though gro&s;sly ignorant, e&s;pecially in matters of religion, they are a good moral people. It is rare to hear among them of perjury, thieving, fraud, or drunkenne&s;s; if we except tho&s;e who live among the Ru&s;&s;ian Chri&s;tians, with who&s;e vices they are tainted. Strahlenberg<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">De&s;cription of Ru&s;&s;ia, Siberia, &amp;c.</NOTE> bears te&s;timony to their hone&s;ty. Having employed a number of them in a long navigation, he &s;lept in the &s;ame boat with men who&s;e names he knew not, who&s;e language he under&s;tood not, and yet
<PB N="90" REF="94">
lo&s;t not a particle of his baggage. Being obliged to remain a fortnight among the O&s;tiacs, upon the river Oby, his baggage lay open in a hut in|habited by a large family, and yet nothing was purloined. The following incident, which he al&s;o mentions, is remarkable. A Ru&s;&s;ian of To|bol&s;ki, in the cour&s;e of a long journey, lodged one night in an O&s;tiac's hut, and the next day on the road mi&s;&s;ed his pur&s;e with a hundred ru|bles. His landlord's &s;on, hunting at &s;ome di&s;tance from the hut, found the pur&s;e, but left it there. By his father's order, he covered it with branch|es, to &s;ecure it in ca&s;e an owner &s;hould be found. After three months, the Ru&s;&s;ian re|turning, lodged with the &s;ame O&s;tiac; and men|tioning occa&s;ionally the lo&s;s of his pur&s;e, the O&s;tiac, who at fir&s;t did not recollect his face, cried out with joy, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Art thou the man who lo&s;t that pur&s;e? my &s;on &s;hall go and &s;hew thee where it lies, that thou maye&s;t take it up with thine own hand."</Q> The Hottentots<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Kolben.</NOTE> have not the lea&s;t notion of theft: tho' im|moderately fond of tobacco and brandy, they are employed by the Dutch for tending warehou&s;es full of the&s;e commodities. Here is an in&s;tance of probity above temptation, even among &s;ava|ges in the fir&s;t &s;tage of &s;ocial life. Some indi|viduals are more liberally endued than others with virtuous principles: may it not be thought, that in that re&s;pect nature has been more kind to the Hottentots than to many other tribes? Spa|niards, &s;ettled on the &s;ea-coa&s;t of Chili, carry on a commerce with neighbouring &s;avages, for bri|dles, &s;purs, knives, and other manufactures of
<PB N="91" REF="95">
iron; and in return receive oxen, hor&s;es, and even children for &s;laves. A Spaniard carries his goods there; and after obtaining liberty to di&s;|po&s;e of them, he moves about, and delivers his goods, without the lea&s;t re&s;erve, to every one who bargains with him. When all is &s;old, he intimates his departure; and every purcha&s;er hurries with his goods to him; and it is not known that any one Indian ever broke his en|gagement. They give him a guard to carry him &s;afe out of their territory, with all the &s;laves, hor&s;es, and cattle he has purcha&s;ed. The &s;ava|ges of Brazil are faithful to their promi&s;es, and to the treaties they make with the Portugue&s;e. Upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, they may be accu&s;ed of error and wrong judgment, but never of inju&s;|tice nor of duplicity.</P>
<P>While the earth was thinly peopled, plenty of food, procured by hunting and fi&s;hing, promoted population; but as population le&s;&s;ens the &s;tock of animal food, a &s;avage nation, encrea&s;ing in num|bers, mu&s;t &s;pread wider and wider for more game. Thus tribes, at fir&s;t widely &s;eparate from each other, approach gradually till they become neighbours. Hence a new &s;cene with re&s;pect to morality. Differences about their hunting fields, about their game, about per&s;onal injuries, mul|tiply between neighbours; and every quarrel is blown into a flame, by the aver&s;ion men natural|ly have to &s;trangers. Anger, hatred, and re|venge, find now vent, which formerly lay latent without an object: di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions prevail without control, becau&s;e among &s;avages morality is no match for them; and cruelty becomes pre|dominant in the human race. Ancient hi&s;tory accordingly is full of enormous cruelties; wit|ne&s;s the incur&s;ions of the northern barbarians into the Roman empire; and witne&s;s the incur&s;ions
<PB N="92" REF="96">
of Genhizcan and Tamerlane into the fertile countries of A&s;ia, &s;preading de&s;truction with fire and &s;word, and &s;paring neither man, wo|man, nor infant.</P>
<P>Malevolent pa&s;&s;ions daily exerci&s;ed again&s;t per|&s;ons of a different tribe, acquiring &s;trength by exerci&s;e, came to be vented again&s;t per&s;ons even of the &s;ame tribe; and the privilege long enjoyed by individuals, of avenging the wrongs done to them, be&s;towed irre&s;i&s;tible force upon &s;uch pa&s;&s;i|ons<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 1.</NOTE>. The hi&s;tory of ancient Greece pre&s;ents nothing to the reader but u&s;urpations, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inati|ons, and other horrid crimes. The names of many famous for wickedne&s;s, are &s;till pre&s;erved; Atreus, for example, Eteocles, Alcmeon, Phe|dra, Clytemne&s;tra. The &s;tory of Pelops and his de&s;cendants, is a chain of criminal horrors: du|ring that period, parricide and ince&s;t were ordi|nary incidents. Euripides repre&s;ents Medea vow|ing revenge again&s;t her hu&s;band Ja&s;on, and laying a plot to poi&s;on him. Of that infamous plot the chorus expre&s;s their approbation, ju&s;tifying every woman who, in like circum&s;tances, acts the &s;ame part.</P>
<P>The frequent incur&s;ions of northern barbarians into the Roman empire, &s;pread de&s;olation and ru|in through the whole. The Romans, from the highe&s;t poli&s;h degenerating into &s;avages, a&s;&s;umed by degrees the cruel and bloody manners of their conquerors; and the conquerors and conquered, blended into one ma&s;s, equalled the gro&s;&s;e&s;t bar|barians of ancient times in ignorance and brutali|ty. Clovis, King of the Franks, even after his conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated without remor&s;e his neare&s;t kin&s;man. The children of
<PB N="93" REF="97">
Clodomir, ann. 530, were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by their two uncles. In the thirteenth centuary, Ezzeli|no de Aromano obtained the &s;overeignty of Pa|dua, by ma&s;&s;acring 12,000 of his fellow-citizens. Galeas Sforza, Duke of Milan, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated ann. 1476 in the cathedral church of Milan, af|ter the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins had put up their prayers for cou|rage to perpetrate the deed. It is a &s;till &s;tronger proof how low morality was in tho&s;e days, that the Pope him&s;elf, Sextus IV. attempted to a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inate the two brothers, Laurent and Julien de Medicis; chu&s;ing the elevation of the ho&s;t as a proper time, when the people would be bu&s;y about their devotions. Nay more, that very Pope, with unparalleled impudence, excommu|nicated the Florentines for doing ju&s;tice upon the intended a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. The mo&s;t &s;acred oaths were in vain employed as a &s;ecurity again&s;t that horrid crime. Childebert II. King of the Franks, en|ticed Magnovald to his court, by a &s;olemn oath that he &s;hould receive no harm: and yet made no difficulty to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him during the gaiety of a banquet. But the&s;e in&s;tances, however horrid, make no figure compared with the ma&s;&s;acre of St Bartholomew, where many thou&s;ands were in|humanly and treacherou&s;ly butchered. Even &s;o late as the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ination was not held in every ca&s;e to be crimi|nal. Many &s;olicitous applications were made to general councils of Chri&s;tian clergy, to declare it criminal in every ca&s;e; but without &s;ucce&s;s. Fer|dinand King of Aragon and Navarre, after re|peated a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations and acts of perfidy, obtained the appellation of <HI>Great:</HI> &s;o little authority had the moral &s;en&s;e during tho&s;e dark ages.</P>
<P>But it is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to mention particular in&s;tances of the overbearing power of malevolent pa&s;&s;ions during &s;uch ages. An opinion, formerly
<PB N="94" REF="98">
univer&s;al, that the innocent may be ju&s;tly involv|ed in the &s;ame puni&s;hment with the guilty, is of it&s;elf irrefragable evidence, that morality once had very little influence when oppo&s;ed by revenge. There is no moral principle more evident, than that puni&s;hment cannot be inflicted with ju&s;tice but upon the guilty; and yet in Greece, the in|volving of the innocent with the guilty in the &s;ame puni&s;hment, was authori&s;ed even by po&s;i|tive law. By an Athenian law, a man commit|ting &s;acrilege, or betraying his country, was ba|ni&s;hed with all his children<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Meur&s;eus de legibus Atticis, lib. 2. cap. 2.</NOTE>. And when a ty|rant was put to death, his children &s;uffered the &s;ame fate<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eod. lib. 2. cap. 15.</NOTE>. The puni&s;hment of trea&s;on in Macedon, was extended again&s;t the criminal's relations<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Quintus Curtius, lib. 6. cap. 11.</NOTE>. Hanno, a citizen of Carthage, formed a plot to en&s;lave his country, by poi&s;on|ing the whole &s;enate at a banquet. He was tor|tured to death; and his children, with all his re|lations, were cut off without mercy, though they had no acce&s;&s;ion to his guilt. Among the Japan|ne&s;e, a people remarkably ferocious, it is the practice to involve children and relations in the puni&s;hment of capital crimes. Even Cicero, the chief man for learning in the mo&s;t enlighten|ed period of the Roman republic, and a celebra|ted morali&s;t, approves that practice: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nec vero me fugit, quam &s;it acerbum parentum &s;celera filiorum poenis lui: &s;ed hoc praeclare legibus comparatum e&s;t, ut caritas liberorum amiciores

<P>Human nature is not &s;o perver&s;e, as without veil or di&s;gui&s;e to puni&s;h a per&s;on acknowledged to be innocent.

The practice of &s;hedding blood unju&s;tly, and often wantonly, blunts con&s;cience, and paves the way to every crime. This ob&s;ervation is verified in the an|cient Greeks: their cruel and &s;anguinary charac|ter, rendered them little regardful of the &s;trict rules of ju&s;tice. Right was held to depend on power, among men as among wild bea&s;ts: it was conceived to be the will of the gods, that &s;uperior force &s;hould be a lawful title to domi|nion; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for what right can the weak have to what they cannot defend?"</Q> Were that max|im to obtain, a weak man would have no right to liberty nor to life.

A nation begins not to po|li&s;h nor to advance in morality, till writing be common; and writing was not known among the Greeks at the &s;iege of Troy. Nor were the morals of that people, as we &s;ee, much purified for a long time after writing became common. When Plautus wrote, the Roman &s;y&s;tem of mo|rals mu&s;t have been extremely impure. In his play termed <HI>Menaechmi,</HI> a gentleman of fa&s;hion having accidentally got into his hands a lady's robe with a gold cla&s;p, in&s;tead of returning them to the owner, endeavours to &s;ell them without &s;hame or remor&s;e. Such a &s;cene would not be &s;uffered at pre&s;ent, except among pick-pockets. Both the Greeks and Carthaginians were held by the Romans to be artful and cunning. The Ro|mans continued a plain people, with much &s;im|plicity of manners, when the nations mentioned had made great progre&s;s in the arts of life; and it is a fad truth, that morality declines in propor|tion as a nation poli&s;hes. But if the Romans were later than the Greeks and Carthaginians in the arts of life, they &s;oon &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them in eve|ry &s;ort of immorality. For this change of man|ners they were indebted to their rapid conque&s;ts. The &s;anguinary di&s;po&s;ition both of the Greeks and Romans, appears from another practice, that
<PB N="102" REF="106">
of expo&s;ing their infant children, which conti|nued till humanity came in &s;ome mea&s;ure to pre|vail. The practice continues in China to this day, the populou&s;ne&s;s of the country throwing a veil over the cruelty; but from the humanity of the Chine&s;e, I conjecture, that the practice will be found rare. The Jews, a cloudy and peevi&s;h tribe, much addicted to blood&s;hed, were mi&s;era|bly defective in moral principles. Take the fol|lowing examples out of an endle&s;s number re|corded in the bocks of the old Te&s;tament. Jael, wife of Heber, took under her protection Si&s;era general of the Canaanites, and engaged her faith for his &s;ecurity.

<P>European nations, who originally were fierce and &s;anguinary like the Greeks and Jews, had the &s;ame cloudy and uncorrect notions of right and wrong. It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to give in&s;tan|ces, the low &s;tate of morality during the dark ages of Chri&s;tianity being known to all. In the time of Louis XI. of France, promi&s;es and en|gagements were utterly di&s;regarded, till they were &s;anctified by a &s;olemn oath: nor were &s;uch oaths long regarded; they lo&s;t their force, and were not relied on more than &s;imple promi&s;es. All faith among men &s;eemed to be at an end. Even tho&s;e who appeared the mo&s;t &s;crupulous about character, were however ready to gra&s;p at any &s;ubterfuge to excu&s;e their breach of engage|ment. And it is a &s;till &s;tronger proof of &s;elf-de|ceit, that &s;uch &s;ubterfuges were frequently pre|pared beforehand, in order to furni&s;h an excu&s;e. It was a common practice &s;ome ages ago, to make private prote&s;tations, which were thought &s;ufficient to relieve men in con&s;cience from being bound by a &s;olemn treaty. Charles, afterward Emperor of Germany, during his minority, gave authority to declare publicly his acce&s;&s;ion to a treaty of peace, between his grandfather Max|imilian and the King of France: but at the &s;ame time prote&s;ted privately, before a notary and wit|ne&s;&s;es, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That notwith&s;tanding his public acce&s;|&s;ion to the &s;aid treaty, it was not his intention to be bound by every article of it; and parti|cularly, that the clau&s;e re&s;erving to the King of France the &s;overeignty of certain territories in the Netherlands, &s;hould not be binding."</Q> Is it po&s;&s;ible Charles could be &s;o blind, as not to
<PB N="106" REF="110">
&s;ee, that &s;uch practice, if it have any effect, mu&s;t de&s;troy all faith among men? What better was this than what was practi&s;ed by Robert King of France in the tenth century, to free his &s;ub|jects from the guilt of perjury? They &s;wore upon a box of relics, out of which the relics were privately taken. Correa, a Portugue&s;e ge|neral, made a treaty with the King of Pegu; and it was agreed, that each party &s;hould &s;wear to ob&s;erve the treaty, laying his hand upon the &s;a|cred book of his religion. Correa &s;wore upon a collection of &s;ongs, and by that vile &s;tratagem thought that he was not bound. The inhabitants of Britain were &s;o loo&s;e formerly, that a man was not reckoned &s;afe in his own hou&s;e, without a ma&s;tiff to protect him from violence. Ma&s;tiffs were permitted even to tho&s;e who dwelt within the king's fore&s;ts; and to prevent danger to the deer, there was in England a court for <HI>Lawing</HI> or <HI>expeditation</HI> of ma&s;tives, <HI>i. e.</HI> for cutting off the claws of their fore-feet, to prevent them from running<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Carta de Fore&s;ta, cap. 6.</NOTE>. The trial and condemnation of Charles I. in a pretended court of ju&s;tice, how|ever audacious and uncon&s;titutional, was yet an effort toward regularity and order. In the prece|ding age, the king would have been taken off by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination or poi&s;on. Every prince in Europe had an officer who&s;e province it was to &s;ecure his ma&s;ter again&s;t poi&s;on. A lady was appointed to that office by Queen Elizabeth of England; and the form was, to give to each of the &s;ervants a mouthful to eat of the di&s;h he brought in. Poi|&s;on mu&s;t have been frequent in tho&s;e days, to make &s;uch a regulation nece&s;&s;ary. To vouch &s;till more clearly the low ebb of morality during that
<PB N="107" REF="111">
period, &s;eldom it happened that a man of figure died &s;uddenly, or of an unu&s;ual di&s;ea&s;e, but poi|&s;on was &s;u&s;pected. Men con&s;cious of their own vicious di&s;po&s;ition, are prone to &s;u&s;pect others. The Dauphin, &s;on to Francis I. of France, a youth of about eighteen, having overheated him|&s;elf at play, took a great draught of iced water, and died of a pleuri&s;y in five days. The death was &s;udden, but none is more natural. The &s;u&s;|picion however of poi&s;on was univer&s;al; and Montecuculi, who attended the young prince, was formally condemned to death and executed for it; for no better rea&s;on, than that he had at all times ready acce&s;s to the prince.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the low &s;tate of morality where di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions bear rule, as in the &s;cenes now di&s;played, one would require a miracle to recover mankind out of &s;uch anarchy. But, as ob&s;erved above<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 2. &s;ketch 1.</NOTE>, Providence brings order out of confu|&s;ion. The intolerable di&s;tre&s;s of a &s;tate of things where a promi&s;e, or even an oath, is a rope of &s;and, and where all are &s;et again&s;t all<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hobbes.</NOTE>, made people at la&s;t &s;en&s;ible, that they mu&s;t either re|nounce &s;ociety altogether, or qualify them&s;elves for it, by checking their di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions. Find|ing from experience, that the gratification of &s;o|cial affections exceeds greatly that of cruelty and revenge, men endeavoured to acquire a habit of &s;elf-command, and of re&s;training their &s;tormy pa&s;&s;ions. The nece&s;&s;ity of fulfilling every moral duty was recogni&s;ed: men li&s;tened to con&s;cience, the voice of God in their hearts: and the moral &s;en&s;e was cordially &s;ubmitted to, as the ultimate
<PB N="108" REF="112">
judge in all matters of right and wrong. Saluta|ry laws and &s;teady government contributed to per|fect that glorious revolution: private conviction alone would not have been effectual, not at lea&s;t in many ages.</P>
<P>From that revolution is derived what is termed <HI>the law of nations,</HI> meaning certain regulations dictated by the moral &s;en&s;e in its maturity. The laws of our nature refine gradually as our nature refines. The putting an enemy to death in cold blood, is aver&s;e to improved nature, though com|mon while barbarity prevailed. It is held infamous to u&s;e poi&s;oned weapons, though the moral &s;en&s;e made little oppo&s;ition while rancour and revenge were ruling pa&s;&s;ions. Aver&s;ion again&s;t &s;trangers is taught to vary its object, from individuals to the nation that is our enemy: I bear enmity again&s;t France; but di&s;like not any one French|man, being con&s;cious that it is the duty of &s;ub|jects to &s;erve their king and country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In one of our ill-concerted de&s;cents upon France during the late war, &s;ignal humanity appeared, in for|bearing to burn a manufactory of &s;ails and ropes, be|longing to the King; becau&s;e it would have de&s;troyed an adjoining building of the &s;ame kind belonging to a private manufacturer.</NOTE>.

<P>But cruelty is not the only antagoni&s;t to mora|lity. There is another, le&s;s violent indeed, but more cunning and undermining; and that is the hoarding-appetite. Before money was introduced, that appetite was extremely faint: in the fir&s;t &s;tage of civil &s;ociety, men are &s;atisfied with plain nece&s;&s;aries; and having the&s;e in plenty, they think
<PB N="109" REF="113">
not of providing again&s;t want. But money is a &s;pecies of property, &s;o univer&s;al in operation, and &s;o permanent in value, as to rou&s;e the appe|tite for hoarding: love of money excites indu&s;try; and the many beautiful productions of indu&s;try, magnificent hou&s;es, &s;plendid gardens, rich gar|ments, inflame the appetite to an extreme. In the thirteenth century, &s;o ob&s;cured was the moral &s;en&s;e by rapacity and avarice, that robbery on the high-way, and the coining fal&s;e money, were in Germany held to be privileges of great lords. That perjury was common in the city of London, e&s;pecially among jurymen, makes a preamble in more than one &s;tatute of Henry VII. In <HI>the Dance of Death,</HI> tran&s;lated from the French in the &s;aid king's reign, with additions adapted to Engli&s;h manners, a juryman is introduced, who, influenced by bribes, had often given a fal&s;e ver|dict. And the &s;heriff was often &s;u&s;pected as ac|ce&s;&s;ory to the crime, by returning for jurymen per&s;ons of a bad character. Carew, in his ac|count of Cornwall, &s;ays, that it was an ordinary article in an attorney's bill, to charge <HI>pro amicitia vicecomitis</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"For the friend&s;hip of the &s;heriff."</Q></NOTE>. Perjury in jurors of the city of London, is greatly complained of. Stow informs us, that, in the year 1468, many jurors of that city were puni&s;hed, and papers fixed on their heads, declaring their offence, of being corrupted by the parties to the &s;uit. He complains of that corruption as flagrant in the reign of Elizabeth, when he wrote his account of London. Fuller, in his Engli&s;h Worthies, mentions it as a pro|verbial &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That London juries hang half, and &s;ave half."</Q> Grafton, in his Chronicle,
<PB N="110" REF="114">
mentions, that the chancellor of the Bi&s;hop of London being indicted for murder, the Bi&s;hop wrote a letter to Cardinal Wol&s;ey, begging his interpo&s;ition for having the pro&s;ecution &s;topt, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"becau&s;e London juries were &s;o corrupted, that they would find Abel guilty of the murder of Cain."</Q> In that period, the morals of the Engli&s;h were in every particular extremely loo&s;e. We learn from Strype's annals<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vol. 4.</NOTE>, that in the county of Somer&s;et alone, forty per&s;ons were ex|ecuted in one year for robbery, theft, and other felonies, thirty-five burnt in the hand, thirty-&s;even whipped, one hundred and eighty-three di&s;charged, though mo&s;t wicked and de&s;perate per&s;ons; and yet that the fifth part of the felo|nies committed in that county were not brought to trial, either from cunning in the felons, indolence in the magi&s;trate, or fooli&s;h lenity in the people; that other counties were in no better condition, and many in a wor&s;e; and that commonly there were three or four hundred able-bodied vagabonds in every county, who lived by theft and rapine. Harri&s;on computes, that in the reign of Henry VIII. &s;eventy-two thou&s;and thieves and rogues were hanged; and that in Elizabeth's time there were only hanged yearly between three and four hundred for theft and robbery. At pre&s;ent, there are not forty hanged in a year for the&s;e crimes. The &s;ame author reports, that in the reign of Eli|zabeth, there were computed to be in England ten thou&s;and gyp&s;ies.

<P>To control the hoarding appetite, which when inflamed is the bane of civil &s;ociety, the God of nature has provided two efficacious principles; the moral &s;en&s;e, and the &s;en&s;e of property.

cheri&s;hed in a good government, are a &s;ufficient counterbalance to the hoarding appetite. The an|cient Egyptians enjoyed for ages the ble&s;&s;ings of good government; and moral principles were among them carried to a greater degree of refine|ment, than at pre&s;ent even in our courts of equi|ty. It was made the duty of every one, to &s;uc|cour tho&s;e who were unju&s;tly attacked: even pa&s;|&s;engers were not exempted. A regulation among them, that a man could not be impri&s;oned for debt, was well &s;uited to the tenor of their laws and manners: it could not have taken place but among an hone&s;t and indu&s;trious people. In old Rome, though remarkable for temperance and au|&s;terity of manners, a debtor could be impri&s;oned, and even &s;old as a &s;lave, for payment of the debt; but the Patricians were the creditors, and the poor Plebeians were held in woful &s;ubjection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A bankrupt in England who pays three fourths of his debt, and obtains a certificate of his good behavi|our, is di&s;charged of all the debts contracted by him before his bankruptcy. Such regulation was perhaps not un&s;uitable to the moderation and frugality of the period when it was made. But luxury and external &s;how, have now become our ruling pa&s;&s;ions; and to &s;upply our extravagance, money mu&s;t be procured at any rate. Trade in particular has degenerated into a &s;pecies of gaming; men venturing their all, in hopes of a lucky hit to elevate them above their neighbours. And did they only venture their own, the ca&s;e would not be deplorable; they venture all they can procure upon credit; and by that means, reduce to beggary many an innocent family: with re&s;pect to them&s;elves, they know the wor&s;t of it, which is to be cleared from their debts by a certificate. The morals of our people are indeed at &s;o low an ebb, as to require the mo&s;t &s;e|vere laws again&s;t bankruptcy. When a man borrows a &s;um, it is implied in the covenant, that all his ef|fects
pre&s;ent and future &s;hall lie open to the creditor; for which rea&s;on, it is contradictory to ju&s;tice, that a creditor &s;hould be forced to di&s;charge his debtor with|out obtaining complete payment. Many debtors, it is true, de&s;erve favour; but it ought to be left to the hu|manity of creditors, and not to be forced from them by law. The debtor, at the &s;ame time, may be &s;afely left to the humanity of his creditors: for if he have con|ducted his affairs with &s;trict integrity, and with any de|gree of prudence, there will &s;carce be found one man &s;o hard-hearted, as to &s;tand out again&s;t the laudable and benevolent intentions of his fellow-creditors. Nay, if he have any regard to character, he dares not &s;tand out: he would be held as a mon&s;ter, and be abhorred by all the world. To leave a bankrupt thus to the mercy of his creditors, would produce the mo&s;t &s;alutary ef|fects. It would excite men to be &s;trictly ju&s;t in their dealings, and put an end to gaming, &s;o de&s;tructive to credit; becau&s;e mi&s;behaviour in any of the&s;e particu|lars would &s;et the whole creditors again&s;t their debtor, and leave him no hope of favour. In the late bankrupt|&s;tatute for Scotland, accordingly, the clau&s;e con|cerning the certificate was wi&s;ely left out, as un|&s;uitable to the depraved manners of the pre&s;ent times.</NOTE>. The

<P>It is needle&s;s to di&s;&s;emble, that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, &s;en|&s;uality, and avarice, mu&s;t in England be the fruits of great opulence, as in every other coun|try; and that morality cannot maintain its autho|rity again&s;t &s;uch undermining antagoni&s;ts.

In the infancy of morality, a promi&s;e makes but a &s;light impre&s;&s;ion: to give it force, it is commonly accompanied with many &s;o|lemnities<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 2.</NOTE>; and in treaties between &s;overeigns, even the&s;e &s;olemnities are not relied on without a &s;olemn oath.

to make them effectual. The &s;tatutes made again&s;t gaming, and again&s;t bribery and corruption in elections, have no authority over a degenerate people. Nothing is &s;tudied, but how to evade the penalties; and &s;uppo&s;ing &s;tatutes to be made without end for preventing known eva&s;i|ons, new eva&s;ions will &s;pring up in their &s;tead. The mi&s;ery is, that &s;uch laws, if they prove abor|tive, are never innocent with regard to con&s;equen|ces; for nothing is more &s;ubver&s;ive of morality as well as of patrioti&s;m, than a habit of di&s;regarding the laws of our country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lying and perjury are not in every ca&s;e equally cri|minal; at lea&s;t are not commonly reckoned &s;o.

To relieve from puni&s;hment, few boggle at a lie or at perjury: &s;incerity is not even expected; and hence the practice of torture. Many men are not &s;crupulous about oaths, when they have no view but to ob|tain ju&s;tice to them&s;elves: the Jacobites, that they might not be deprived of their privileges as Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects, made no great difficulty to &s;wallow oaths to the pre&s;ent government, though in them it was perjury. It is dangerous to withdraw the &s;malle&s;t peg in the moral edifice; for the whole will totter and tumble. Men creep on to vice by degrees. Perjury, in order to &s;upport a friend, has become cu&s;tomary of late years; witne&s;s fictitious qualifications in the electors of parliament-men, which are made effectual by perjury: yet &s;uch is the degeneracy of the pre&s;ent times, that no man is the wor&s;e thought of upon that account. We mu&s;t not flatter our&s;elves that the poi&s;on will reach no farther; a man who boggles not at perjury to &s;erve a friend, will in time become &s;uch an adept, as to com|mit perjury in order to ruin a friend when he becomes an enemy.</NOTE>.</P>

England never was at any time &s;o inferior to France, as to &s;uffer their king to accept a pen&s;ion, whatever private tran&s;|actions might be between the kings them&s;elves. But the mini&s;ters of England thought it no di&s;pa|ragement, to receive pen&s;ions from France. E|very mini&s;ter of Edward IV. of England received a pen&s;ion from Louis XI.; and they made no difficulty of granting a receipt accordingly. The old Earl of Warwick, &s;ays Commines, was the only exception: he took the money, but refu&s;ed a receipt. Cardinal Wol&s;ey had a pen&s;ion both from the Emperor and from the King of France: and his ma&s;ter Henry was vain, that his mini&s;ter was &s;o much regarded by the fir&s;t powers in Eu|rope. During the reigns of Charles II. and of his brother James, England made &s;o de&s;picable a figure, that the mini&s;ters accepted pen&s;ions from Louis XIV. A king void of virtue was never well &s;erved. King Charles, mo&s;t di&s;graceful|ly accepted a pen&s;ion from France? what &s;cruple could his mini&s;ters have? Britain, governed by a king eminently virtuous and patriotic, makes at pre&s;ent &s;o great a figure, that even the lowe&s;t mini&s;ter would di&s;dain a pen&s;ion from any foreign prince. Men formerly were &s;o blind as not to &s;ee, that a pen&s;ion creates a bias in a mini&s;ter, again&s;t his ma&s;ter and his country. At pre&s;ent, men are &s;o quick-&s;ighted as clearly to &s;ee, that a foreign pen&s;ion to a mini&s;ter is no better than a bribe; and it would be held &s;o by all the world.</P>

In a nation enriched by conque&s;t or commerce, where &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions always prevail, it is diffi|cult to &s;tem the tide of immorality: the decline of virtue may be retarded by whole&s;ome regula|tions; but no regulations will ever re&s;tore it to its meridian vigour. Marcus Aurelius, Emperor of Rome, cau&s;ed &s;tatues to be made of all the brave men who figured in the Germanic war. It has long been a practice in China, to honour per&s;ons eminent for virtue, by fea&s;ting them an|nually at the Emperor's expence. A late Empe|ror made an improvement: he ordered reports to be &s;ent him annually, of men and women who when alive had been remarkable for public &s;pirit or private virtue, in order that monuments might be erected to their memory. The following re|port is one of many that were &s;ent to the Empe|ror. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"According to the order of your Maje&s;ty, for erecting monuments to the honour of wo|men, who have been celebrated for conti|nence, for filial piety, or for purity of man|ners, the viceroy of Canton reports, that in the town of Sinhoei, a beautiful young wo|man, named <HI>Leang,</HI> &s;acrificed her life to &s;ave her cha&s;tity.

But

they would need angels to put them in execution. Every deviation from a ju&s;t &s;election enervates them; and frequent deviations render them a &s;ubject of ridicule. But how are deviations to be prevented, when men are the judges? Tho&s;e who di&s;tribute the rewards will prefer their friends, and overlook tho&s;e of greater merit. Like the cen&s;orian power in Rome, &s;uch regula|tions, after many abu&s;es, will &s;ink into con|tempt.</P>
<P>Two errors, which infe&s;ted morality in dark times, have occa&s;ioned much inju&s;tice; and I am not certain, that they are yet totally eradicated. The fir&s;t is an opinion, That an action derives its quality of right and wrong from the event, without regard to intention. The other is, That the end ju&s;tifies the means; or, in other words, That means, otherwi&s;e unlawful, may be law|fully employed to bring about a good end. With an account of the&s;e two errors, I &s;hall clo&s;e the pre&s;ent hi&s;torical &s;ketch.</P>
<P>That intention is the circum&s;tance which qua|lifies an action, and its author, to be criminal or innocent, is made evident in the fir&s;t part of the pre&s;ent &s;ketch, and is now admitted to be &s;o by every moral writer. But rude and barbarous na|tions &s;eldom carry their thoughts beyond what falls under their external &s;en&s;es: they conclude an action to be right that happens to do good, and an action to be wrong that happens to do harm; without ever thinking of motives, of will, of intention, or of any circum&s;tance that is not obvious to eye-&s;ight. From many pa&s;&s;ages in the Old Te&s;tament it appears, that the external act only, with its con&s;equences, were regarded. I&s;aac, imitating his father Abraham, made his wife Rebecca pa&s;s for his &s;i&s;ter. Abimelech, King of the Phili&s;tines, having di&s;covered the

<P>The Greeks appear to have wavered greatly about intention, &s;ometimes holding it e&s;&s;ential to a crime, and &s;ometimes di&s;regarding it as a cir|cum&s;tance of no moment. Of the&s;e contradic|tory opinions we have pregnant evidence in the two tragedies of Oedipus; the fir&s;t taking it for granted, that a crime con&s;i&s;ts entirely in the ex|ternal act and its con&s;equences; the other hold|ing intention to be indi&s;pen&s;able. Oedipus had killed his father Laius, and married his mother Joca&s;ta; but without any criminal intention, be|ing ignorant of his relation to them. And yet hi&s;tory informs us, that the gods puni&s;hed the Thebans with pe&s;tilence, for &s;uffering a wretch &s;o gro&s;sly criminal to live. Sophocles, author of both tragedies, puts the following words in the mouth of Tire&s;ias the prophet.<Q><PB N="122" REF="126">
<L>&mdash;Know then,</L>
<L>With tho&s;e he loves, uncon&s;cious of his guilt,</L>
<L>Is yet mo&s;t guilty.</L></Q> And that doctrine is e&s;pou&s;ed by Ari&s;totle in a later period, who holding Oedipus to have been deeply criminal, though without intention, is of opinion, that a more proper &s;ubject for tragedy never was brought upon the &s;tage. Nay as a philo&s;opher he talks currently of an involuntary crime. Ore&s;tes, in Euripides, acknowledges him|&s;elf to be guilty in killing his mother; yet a&s;&s;erts with the &s;ame breath, that his crime was inevi|table, a nece&s;&s;ary crime, a crime commanded by religion.</P>
<P>In Oedipus Coloneus, the other tragedy menti|oned, a very different propo&s;ition is maintained. A defence is made for that unlucky man, agreeable to &s;ound moral principles, that, having had no bad intention, he was entirely innocent; and that his misfortunes ought to be a&s;cribed to the wrath of the gods.<Q><L>Thou who upbraid'&s;t me thus for all my woes,</L>

By act 19. parl. 1649, renewed act 22. parl. 1661, the capital puni&s;hment is converted to impri&s;onment, or a fine to the wife and chil|dren. In a period &s;o late as the Re&s;toration, &s;trange blindne&s;s it was, not to perceive, that homicide in &s;elf-defence, being a lawful act, ju&s;|tified by the &s;tricte&s;t rules of morality, &s;ubjects not a man to puni&s;hment, more than the defend|ing his property again&s;t a robber; and that ca|&s;ual homicide, meaning homicide committed in|nocently without ill intention, may &s;ubject him to reparation, but never to any puni&s;hment, mild or &s;evere.</P>

The other error mentioned above, is, That the end ju&s;tifies the means. In defence of that propo&s;ition, it is urged, that the character of the means is derived from the end; that every action mu&s;t be right which contributes to a good end, and that every action mu&s;t be wrong which con|tributes to an ill end.

Among many &s;avage tribes, there are no words but for objects of external &s;en&s;e: is it &s;urpri&s;ing, that &s;uch people are incapable to expre&s;s their re|ligious perceptions, or any perception of internal &s;en&s;e? and from their &s;ilence can it be fairly pre|&s;umed, that they have no &s;uch perception<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the language even of Peru, there is not a word for expre&s;&s;ing an ab&s;tract idea, &s;uch as <HI>time, endurance, &s;pace, exi&s;tence, &s;ub&s;tance, matter, body.</HI> It is no le&s;s defective in expre&s;&s;ing moral ideas, &s;uch as <HI>virtue, ju&s;|tice, gratitude, liberty.</HI> The Yameos, a tribe on the river Oroonoko, de&s;cribed by Condamine, u&s;e the word <HI>poettarraroincouroac</HI> to expre&s;s the number three, and have no word for a greater number.

The belief of &s;uperior powers, in every country where there are words to expre&s;s it, is &s;o well vouched, that in fair rea&s;oning it ought to be taken for granted among the few tribes where language is deficient. Even the gro&s;&s;e&s;t idolatry affords to me evidence of that belief. No nation can be &s;o bruti&s;h as to wor&s;hip a &s;tock or a &s;tone, merely as &s;uch. The vi&s;ible object is always imagined to be connected with &s;ome invi&s;ible power; and the wor&s;hip paid to the former, is as repre&s;enting the latter, or as in &s;ome manner connected with it. Every family among the ancient Lithuanians, en|tertained a real &s;erpent as a hou&s;ehold god; and the &s;ame practice is at pre&s;ent univer&s;al, among the negroes in the kingdom of Whidah: it is not the &s;erpent that is wor&s;hipped, but &s;ome deity im|agined to re&s;ide in it. The ancient Egyptians were not idiots, to pay divine honours to a bull
<PB N="128" REF="132">
or a cat, as &s;uch: the divine honours were paid to a deity, as re&s;iding in the&s;e animals. The &s;un is to man a familiar object: as it is frequently ob&s;cured by clouds, and totally eclip&s;ed during night, a &s;avage readily conceives it to be a great fire &s;ometimes flaming bright, &s;ometimes ob&s;cured, and &s;ometimes extingui&s;hed. Whence then &s;un|wor&s;hip, once univer&s;al among &s;avages? Plainly from the &s;ame cau&s;e: it is not properly the &s;un that is wor&s;hipped, but a deity who is &s;uppo&s;ed to dwell in that luminary.</P>
<P>Taking it then for granted, that our belief of &s;uperior powers has been long univer&s;al, the im|portant que&s;tion is, From what cau&s;e it proceeds. A belief &s;o univer&s;al, and &s;o permanent, cannot proceed from chance, but mu&s;t have a cau&s;e ope|rating con&s;tantly and invariably upon all men in all ages. Philo&s;ophers, who believe the world to be eternal and &s;elf-exi&s;tent, and imagine it to be the only deity, though without intelligence, endeavour to account for our belief of &s;uperior powers, from the terror that thunder and other elementary con|vul&s;ions rai&s;e in &s;avages; and thence conclude that &s;uch belief is no evidence of a deity.

Now, if the authors quoted mean only, that the fir&s;t perception of deity among &s;avages is occa&s;ioned by fear, I heartily &s;ub&s;cribe to their opinion. But if it was their meaning, that &s;uch perceptions proceed from fear &s;olely, without having any other cau&s;e, I wi&s;h to be informed, from what &s;ource is derived the belief we have of &s;uperior benevolent beings. Fear cannot be the &s;ource: and it will be &s;een anon, that though malevolent deities were fir&s;t recogni&s;ed among &s;avages; yet that in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, the exi&s;tence of benevo|lent deities was univer&s;ally believed. The fact is certain; and therefore fear is not the &s;ole
<PB N="130" REF="134">
cau&s;e of our believing the exi&s;tence of &s;uperior be|ings.</P>
<P>It is be&s;ide to me evident, that the belief even of malevolent deities, once univer&s;al among all the tribes of men, cannot be accounted for from fear &s;olely. I ob&s;erve, fir&s;t, That there are many men, to whom an eclip&s;e, an earthquake, and even thunder are unknown: Egypt in particular, though the country of &s;uper&s;tition, is little or not at all acquainted with the two latter. Nor do &s;uch appearances &s;trike terror into every one who is acquainted with them. The univer&s;ality of the belief, mu&s;t then have &s;ome cau&s;e more univer&s;al than fear. I ob&s;erve next, That if the belief were founded &s;olely on fear, it would die away gradually as men improve in the knowledge of cau&s;es and effects. In&s;truct a &s;avage, that thun|der, an eclip&s;e, an earthquake, proceed from na|tural cau&s;es, and are not threatenings of an incen&s;|ed deity; his fear of malevolent beings will va|ni&s;h; and with it his belief in them, if founded &s;olely on fear. Yet the direct contrary is true: in proportion as the human under&s;tanding ripens, our belief of &s;uperior powers, or of a Deity, turns more and more firm and authoritative; which will be made evident in the chapter imme|diately following.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers of more enlarged views, and of deeper penetration, may po&s;&s;ibly think, that the operations of nature, and the government of this world, which loudly proclaim a Deity, may be &s;ufficient to open the eyes of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;avages, and to convince them that there is a Deity. And to give due weight to the argument, I &s;hall relate a conver&s;ation between a Greenlander and a Da|ni&s;h mi&s;&s;ionary, mentioned by Crantz in his hi&s;|tory of Greenland. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is true,"</Q> &s;ays the Green|lander, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we were ignorant Heathens, and knew
<PB N="131" REF="135">
little of a God, till you came. But you mu&s;t not imagine, that no Greenlander thinks about the&s;e things. A kajak<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">A Greenland boat.</NOTE>, with all its tackle and implements, cannot exi&s;t but by the la|bour of man; and one who does not under|&s;tand it, would &s;poil it. But the meane&s;t bird requires more &s;kill than the be&s;t kajak; and no man can make a bird. There is &s;till more &s;kill required to make a man: by whom then was he made? He proceeded from his pa|rents, and they from their parents. But &s;ome mu&s;t have been the fir&s;t parents: whence did they proceed? Common report &s;ays, that they grew out of the earth: if &s;o, why do not men &s;till grow out of the earth? And from whence came the earth it&s;elf, the &s;un, the moon, the &s;tars? Certainly there mu&s;t be &s;ome being who made all the&s;e things, a being more wi&s;e than the wi&s;e&s;t man."</Q> The rea&s;oning here from effects to their cau&s;es, is &s;ta|ted with great preci&s;ion; and were all men equal|ly penetrating with the Greenlander, &s;uch rea&s;o|ning might perhaps be &s;ufficient to account for the belief of Deity, univer&s;ally &s;pread among all &s;a|vages. But &s;uch penetration is a rare quality among &s;avages; and yet the belief of &s;uperior powers is univer&s;al, not excepting even the gro&s;&s;|e&s;t &s;avages, who are altogether incapable of rea|&s;oning like our Greenland philo&s;opher. Natural hi&s;tory has made &s;o rapid a progre&s;s of late years, and the finger of God is &s;o vi&s;ible to us in the va|rious operations of nature, that we do not readily conceive how even &s;avages can be ignorant: but it is a common fallacy in rea&s;oning, to judge of others by what we feel in our&s;elves. And to
<PB N="132" REF="136">
give ju&s;ter notions of the condition of &s;avages, I take the liberty to introduce the Wogultzoi, a people in Siberia, as exhibiting a &s;triking picture of &s;avages in their natural &s;tate. That people were baptized at the command of Prince Gaga|rin, governor of the province; and Laurent Lange, in his relation of a journey from Peter&s;|burgh to Pekin ann. 1715, gives the following account of their conver&s;ion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I had curio&s;ity,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to que&s;tion them about their wor&s;hip before they embraced Chri&s;tianity. They &s;aid, that they had an idol hung upon a tree, before which they pro&s;trated them&s;elves, rai&s;|ing their eyes to heaven, and howling with a loud voice. They could not explain what they meant by howling; but only that every man howled in his own fa&s;hion. Being inter|rogated, Whether, in rai&s;ing their eyes to heaven, they knew that a god is there, who &s;ees all the actions, and even the thoughts of men; they an&s;wered &s;imply, That heaven is too far above them to know whether a god be there or not; and that they had no care but to provide meat and drink. Another que&s;tion was put, Whether they had not more &s;atisfac|tion in wor&s;hipping the living God, than they formerly had in the darkne&s;s of idolatry; they an&s;wered, We &s;ee no great difference; and we do not break our heads about &s;uch mat|ters."</Q> Judge how little capable &s;uch ignorant &s;avages are, to rea&s;on from effects to their cau&s;es, and to trace a Deity from the operations of nature. And it may be added with great certainty, that could they be made in any degree to conceive &s;uch rea&s;oning, yet &s;o weak and ob&s;cure would their conviction be, as to re&s;t there without mov|ing them to any &s;ort of wor&s;hip; which however
<PB N="133" REF="137">
among &s;avages goes hand in hand with the belief of &s;uperior powers.</P>
<P>To &s;um up this argument: As fear is a cau&s;e altogether in&s;ufficient for the belief of Deity, univer&s;al among all tribes; and as rea&s;oning from effects to their cau&s;es can have no influence upon ignorant &s;avages; what cau&s;e remains but nature it&s;elf? To make this belief univer&s;al, the image of the Deity mu&s;t be &s;tamped upon the mind of every human being, the ignorant equally with the knowing: nothing le&s;s is &s;ufficient. And the perception we have of Deity mu&s;t proceed from an internal cau&s;e, which may be termed the <HI>&s;en&s;e of Deity.</HI></P>
<P>Included in the &s;en&s;e of Deity, is the duty we are under to wor&s;hip him. And to enforce that duty, the principle of devotion is made a part of our nature. All men accordingly agree in wor|&s;hipping &s;uperior beings, however they may dif|&s;er in the mode of wor&s;hip. And the univer&s;a|lity of &s;uch wor&s;hip, proves devotion to be an innate principle.</P>
<P>The perception we have of being accountable beings, ari&s;es from another branch of the &s;en&s;e of Deity. We expect approbation from the Deity when we do right; and dread puni&s;hment from him when guilty of any crime; not excepting the mo&s;t occult crimes, hid from every mortal eye. From what cau&s;e can dread proceed in that ca&s;e, but from belief of a &s;uperior being, aveng|er of wrongs? That dread, when immoderate, di&s;orders the mind, and makes every unu&s;ual mi&s;|fortune pa&s;s for a puni&s;hment in&s;licted by an invi|&s;ible hand. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And they &s;aid one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we &s;aw the angui&s;h of his &s;oul, when he be&s;ought us, and we would not hear: there|fore is this di&s;tre&s;s come upon us.

He was terrified to di&s;traction, when Charles VIII. of France approached with a nu|merous army: he de&s;erted his kingdom; and fled to hide him&s;elf from the face of God and man.</P>
<P>But admitting a &s;en&s;e of Deity, is it evidence to us that a Deity actually exi&s;ts? The an&s;wer is, That it is complete evidence. So framed is man as to rely on the evidence of his &s;en&s;es<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See E&s;&s;ays on Morality and Natural Religion, part 2. &s;ect. 3.</NOTE>; which evidence it is not in his power to reject, were he even di&s;po&s;ed to be a &s;ceptic. And ex|perience confirms our belief; for our &s;en&s;es, when in order, never deceive us.</P>
<P>The foregoing &s;en&s;e of Deity is not the only evidence we have of his exi&s;tence: there is addi|tional evidence from other branches of our na|ture. Inherent in the nature of man are two pa&s;&s;ions, devotion, of which the Diety is the im|mediate and only object; and dread of puni&s;h|ment, when one is guilty of any crime. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ions would be idle and ab&s;urd were there no
<PB N="135" REF="139">
Deity to be wor&s;hipped or to be dreaded: they would be illu&s;ory pa&s;&s;ions, having no object: they would be the &s;ingle in&s;tance of &s;uch irregu|larity; and gro&s;sly irregular it would be, to be endued with pa&s;&s;ions or principles contrived for no end or purpo&s;e. Man makes a capital figure; and is the mo&s;t perfect being that inhabits this earth: how then is it po&s;&s;ible to believe, that he &s;hould be endued with pa&s;&s;ions contradictory to the regular and beautiful laws which govern all other things here? It is not credible. The pa&s;|&s;ions mentioned, both of them, direct us to a Deity, and afford us irre&s;i&s;tible evidence of his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Thus our Maker leaves no work of his imper|fect: he has revealed him&s;elf to us, in a way perfectly analagous to our nature: in the mind of every human creature, he has lighted up a lamp, which renders him vi&s;ible even to the weake&s;t &s;ight. Nor ought it to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation, that here, as in every other ca&s;e, the conduct of Pro|vidence to man, is uniform. It leaves him to be directed by rea&s;on, where liberty of choice is permitted: but in matters of duty, he is provi|ded with guides le&s;s fallible than rea&s;on: in per|forming his duty to man, he is guided by the mo|ral &s;en&s;e; in performing his duty to God, he is guided by the &s;en&s;e of Deity. In the&s;e mirrors, he perceives his duty intuitively.</P>
<P>It is no &s;light &s;upport to this doctrine, that if there really be a Deity, it is highly pre&s;umable, that he will reveal him&s;elf to man, fitted by na|ture to adore and wor&s;hip him. To other ani|mals, the knowledge of a Deity is of no impor|tance: to man, it is of high importance. Were we totally ignorant of a Deity, this world would appear to us a mere chaos: under the govern|ment of a wi&s;e and benevolent Deity, chance is
<PB N="136" REF="140">
excluded; and every event, the re&s;ult of e&s;ta|bli&s;hed laws, is perceived to be the be&s;t on the whole. Good men &s;ubmit to whatever happens, without repining, tru&s;ting that every event is or|dered by divine Providence: they &s;ubmit with entire re&s;ignation; and &s;uch re&s;ignation is a &s;ove|reign bal&s;am to every misfortune.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of Deity re&s;embles our other &s;en&s;es, which lie dormant till a proper object pre&s;ent it&s;elf. When all is &s;ilent about us, the &s;en&s;e of hearing is dormant; and if from infancy a man were confined to a dark room, he would be as ignorant of the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, as one born blind. Among &s;avages, the objects that rou&s;e the &s;en&s;e of Deity, are uncommon events above the power of man; an earthquake, for example, a hurricane, a total eclip&s;e of the &s;un, a &s;udden &s;well of a river that prevents their e&s;cape from an impending enemy. A &s;avage, if he be acquain|ted with no events but what are familiar, has no perception of &s;uperior powers; but thunder rat|tling in his ears, or the convul&s;ion of an earth|quake, rou&s;es in him the &s;en&s;e of Deity, and di|rects him to &s;ome &s;uperior being as the cau&s;e of the&s;e dreadful effects. The &s;avage, it is true, errs in a&s;cribing to the immediate operation of a Deity, things that have a natural cau&s;e: his er|ror however is evidence that he has a &s;en&s;e of Deity, no le&s;s pregnant, than when he more ju&s;t|ly attributes to the immediate operation of Deity, the formation of man, of this earth, of all the world.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of Deity, like the moral &s;en&s;e, makes no capital figure among &s;avages; the per|ceptions of both &s;en&s;es being in them faint and ob&s;cure. But in the progre&s;s of nations to matu|rity, the&s;e &s;en&s;es turn more and more vigorous, &s;o as among enlightened nations to acquire a com|manding
<PB N="137" REF="141">
influence; leaving no doubt about right and wrong, and as little about the exi&s;tence of a Deity.</P>
<P>The ob&s;curity of the &s;en&s;e of Deity among &s;avages, has encouraged &s;ome &s;ceptical philo&s;o|phers to deny its exi&s;tence. It has been urged, That God does nothing by halves; and that if he intended to make him&s;elf known to man, the &s;en&s;e of Deity would produce equal conviction with that of &s;eeing or hearing. When we argue thus about the purpo&s;es of the Almighty, we tread on &s;lippery ground, where we &s;eldom fail to &s;tumble. What if it be the purpo&s;e of the Deity, to afford us but an ob&s;cure glimp&s;e of his being and attributes? We have rea&s;on from analogy to con|jecture, that this may be the ca&s;e. From &s;ome particulars mentioned above<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 2. &s;ketch 1.</NOTE>, it appears at lea&s;t probable, that entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the moral &s;en&s;e, would be ill-&s;uited to man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate; and would prove more hurtful than benefi|cial. And to me it appears evident, that to be con&s;cious of the pre&s;ence of the Great God, as I am of a friend whom I hold by the hand, would be incon&s;i&s;tent with the part that Providence has de&s;tined me to act in this life. Reflect only on the re&s;traint one is under, in pre&s;ence of a &s;uperior, &s;uppo&s;e the King him&s;elf: how much greater our re&s;traint with the &s;ame lively impre&s;&s;ion of God's awful pre&s;ence! Humility and veneration would leave no room for other pa&s;&s;ions: man would be no longer man; and the &s;y&s;tem of our pre&s;ent &s;tate would be totally &s;ubverted. Take another in&s;tance: Such a conviction of future re|wards and puni&s;hments as to overcome every in|ordinate de&s;ire, would reduce us to the condition

of a traveller in a paltry inn, having no wi&s;h but for day-light to pro&s;ecute his journey. For that very rea&s;on, it appears agreeable to the plan of Providence, that we &s;hould have but an ob&s;cure glimp&s;e of futurity. As the &s;ame plan of Provi|dence is vi&s;ible in all, I conclude with a&s;&s;urance, that a certain degree of ob&s;curity, weighs nothing again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of Deity, more than again&s;t the moral &s;en&s;e, or again&s;t a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments. Whether all men might not have been made angels, and whether more hap|pine&s;s might not have re&s;ulted from a different &s;y&s;tem, lie far beyond the reach of human knowledge. From what is known of the con|duct of Providence, we have rea&s;on to pre&s;ume, that our pre&s;ent &s;tate is the re&s;ult of wi&s;dom and benevolence. So much we know with certainty, that the &s;en&s;e we have of Deity and of moral duty, corre&s;pond accurately to the nature of man as an imperfect being; and that the&s;e &s;en&s;es, were they ab&s;olutely perfect, would unhinge his nature, and convert him into a very different being.</P>
<P>A theory e&s;pou&s;ed by &s;everal writers ancient and modern, mu&s;t not be overlooked; becau&s;e it pre|tends to compo&s;e the world without a Deity; which would reduce the &s;en&s;e of Deity to be de|lu&s;ive, if it have any exi&s;tence. The theory is, That the world, compo&s;ed of animals, vegetables, and brute matter, is &s;elf-exi&s;tent and eternal; and that all events happen by a nece&s;&s;ary chain of cau&s;es and effects. In this theory, though wi&s;dom and benevolence are con&s;picuous in every part, yet the great work of planning and executing the whole, is under&s;tood to have been done blindly without intelligence or contrivance. It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that this theory, a&s;&s;umed at plea&s;ure, is highly improbable, if not ab&s;urd;
<PB N="139" REF="143">
and yet that it is left naked to the world without the lea&s;t cover or &s;upport. But what I chiefly in|&s;i&s;t on is, that the endle&s;s number of wi&s;e and be|nevolent effects, di&s;played every where on the face of this globe, afford to us complete evidence of a wi&s;e and benevolent cau&s;e; and as the&s;e effects are far above the power of man, we nece&s;&s;arily a&s;cribe them to &s;ome &s;uperior being, or in other words to the Deity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fir&s;t &s;ketch of this third book, &s;ect. 1.</NOTE>. And this is &s;ufficient to remove the pre&s;ent objection again&s;t the ex|i&s;tence of a &s;en&s;e of Deity. But I am not &s;atisfied with this partial victory. I proceed to ob&s;erve, that nothing more is required but the proof of a Deity, to overturn the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;elf-exi&s;t|ence in a world compo&s;ed of many heterogeneous parts, and of a chain of cau&s;es and effects framed without intelligence or fore&s;ight, though full of wi&s;dom and contrivance in every part. For if a Deity exi&s;t, wi&s;e and powerful above all other beings, &s;elf-exi&s;tence ought to be his peculiar at|tribute; and no per&s;on of rationality will have any he&s;itation in rejecting the &s;elf-exi&s;tence of &s;uch a world, when &s;o natural a &s;uppo&s;ition lies in view, as that the whole is the operation of the truly &s;elf-exi&s;tent Being, who&s;e power and wi&s;dom are fully adequate to that arduous ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Many gro&s;s and ab&s;urd conceptions of Deity that have prevailed among rude nations, are urged by &s;ome writers as another objection again&s;t a &s;en&s;e of Deity.

<HEAD>Progre&s;s of Opinions with re&s;pect to DEITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;en&s;e of Deity, like many other deli|cate &s;en&s;es, is in &s;avages &s;o faint and ob|&s;cure as ea&s;ily to be bia&s;&s;ed from truth. Among them, the belief of many &s;uperior beings, is uni|ver&s;al.
<PB N="141" REF="145">
And two cau&s;es join to produce that belief. The fir&s;t is, that being accu&s;tomed to a plurality of vi&s;ible objects, men, mountains, trees, cattle, and &s;uch like, they are naturally led to imagine the &s;ame plurality in things not vi&s;ible; and from that &s;light bias, &s;light indeed but natu|ral, is partly derived the &s;y&s;tem of Polythei&s;m, univer&s;al among &s;avages. The other is, that &s;a|vages know little of the connection between cau&s;es and effects, and &s;till le&s;s of the order and govern|ment of this world: every event that is not fami|liar, appears to them &s;ingular and extraordinary; and if &s;uch event exceed human power, it is with|out he&s;itation a&s;cribed to a &s;uperior being. But as it occurs not to a &s;avage, nor to any per&s;on who is not a philo&s;opher, that the many various events exceeding human power and &s;eemingly unconnect|ed, may all proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;e; they are readily a&s;cribed to different beings. Pliny a&s;|cribes Polythei&s;m to another cau&s;e, viz. the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s men have of their imbecility: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Our powers are confined within narrow bounds: we do not readily conceive powers in the Deity much more exten&s;ive; and we &s;upply by num|ber what is wanting in power."</Q> Polythei&s;m, thus founded, is the fir&s;t &s;tage in the progre&s;s of theology; for it is embraced by the rude&s;t &s;avages, who have neither capacity nor in|clination to pierce deeper into the nature of things.</P>
<P>The next &s;tage is di&s;tingui&s;hable from others, by a belief that all &s;uperior beings are malevolent. Man by nature weak and helple&s;s, is prone to fear, dreading every new object and every unu&s;u|al event. Savages, having no protection again&s;t &s;torms, tempe&s;ts, or other external accidents, and having no plea&s;ures but in gratifying hunger, thir&s;t, and animal love, have much to fear, and
<PB N="142" REF="146">
little to hope. In that di&s;con&s;olate condition, they attribute the bulk of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es to invi&s;ible beings, who in their opinion mu&s;t be malevolent. This &s;eems to have been the opinion of the Greeks in the days of Solon; as appears in a conver|&s;ation between him and Croe&s;us King of Lydia, mentioned by Herodotus in the fir&s;t book of his hi&s;tory. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Croe&s;us, &s;aid Solon, you a&s;k me about human affairs; and I an&s;wer as one who thinks that all the gods are envious, and di&s;turbers of mankind."</Q> The negroes on the coa&s;t of Guinea, dread their deities as tyrants and oppre&s;&s;ors: having no conception of a good deity, they attribute the few ble&s;&s;ings they re|ceive, to the &s;oil, to the rivers, to the trees, and to the plants. The Lithuanians continued Pagans down to the fourteenth century; and wor&s;hipped in gloomy woods, where their deities were held to re&s;ide. Their wor&s;hip probably was prompt|ed by fear, which is allied to gloomine&s;s or darkne&s;s. The people of Kam&s;katka acknowledge to this day many malevolent deities, having little or no notion of a good deity. They believe the air, the water, the mountains, and the woods, to be inhabited by malevolent &s;pirits, whom they fear and wor&s;hip. The &s;avages of Guiana a&s;cribe to the devil even their mo&s;t com|mon di&s;ea&s;es; nor do they ever think of another remedy, but to apply to a &s;orcerer to drive him away. Such negroes as believe in the devil, paint his images white.</P>
<P>Conviction of &s;uperior beings, who, like men, are of a mixed nature, &s;ometimes doing good, &s;ometimes mi&s;chief, con&s;titutes the third &s;tage. This came to be the &s;y&s;tem of theology in Greece. The introduction of writing among the Greeks, while they were little better than &s;avages, produced a compound of character and
<PB N="143" REF="147">
manners, that has not a parallel in any other na|tion. They were acute in &s;cience, &s;kilful in fine arts, extremely deficient in morals, gro&s;s beyond conception in theology, and &s;uper&s;titious to a de|gree of folly; a &s;trange jumble of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;e and ab&s;urd non&s;en&s;e. They held their gods to re&s;emble men in their external figure, and to be corporeal. In the 21&s;t book of the Iliad, Mi|nerva with a huge &s;tone beats Mars to the ground, who&s;e mon&s;trous body covered &s;even broad acres. As corporeal beings, they were &s;uppo&s;ed to re|quire the nouri&s;hment of meat, drink, and &s;leep. Homer mentions more than once the inviting of gods to a fea&s;t: and Pau&s;anias reports, that in the temple of Bacchus at Athens, there were fi|gures of clay, repre&s;enting a fea&s;t given by Am|phyction to Bacchus and other deities. The in|habitants of the i&s;land Java are not &s;o gro&s;s in their conceptions, as to think that the gods eat the offerings pre&s;ented to them: but it is their opinion, that a deity brings his mouth near the offering, &s;ucks out all its &s;avour, and leaves it ta&s;tele&s;s like water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All Greek writers, and tho&s;e in their neighbour|hood, form the world out of a chaos.

Juno's dre&s;s is mo&s;t poetically de&s;cribed, Iliad, book 14. It was al&s;o univer&s;ally believed, that the gods were fond of women, and had many children by them. The ancient Germans thought more &s;en&s;ibly, that the gods were too high to re|&s;emble men in any degree, or to be confined within the walls of a temple. Led by the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions of deity, the Greeks &s;eem to have thought, that the gods did not much exceed them&s;elves in knowledge. When Age&s;ilaus jour|neyed with his private retinue, he u&s;ually lodged in a temple; making the gods witne&s;&s;es, &s;ays Plutarch, of his mo&s;t &s;ecret actions. The Greeks thought, that a god, like a man, might know what pa&s;&s;ed within his own hou&s;e; without knowing any thing pa&s;&s;ing at a greater di&s;tance. Agamemnon, in E&s;chylus, putting off his travel|ling habit, and dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in &s;plendid pur|ple, is afraid of being &s;een and envied by &s;ome jealous god. We learn from Seneca, that peo|ple &s;trove for the &s;eat next to the image of the deity, that their prayers might be the better heard. But what we hae chiefly to remark up|on this head, is, that the Grecian gods were, like men, held capable of doing both good and ill. Jupiter, their highe&s;t deity, was a ravi&s;h|er of women, and a notorious adulterer. In the &s;econd book of the Iliad, he &s;ends a lying dream to deceive Agamemnon. Mars &s;educes Venus by bribes to commit adultery<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ody&s;&s;ey, book 8.</NOTE>. In the

Rhe&s;us of Euripides, Minerva, di&s;gui&s;ed like Venus, deceives Paris by a gro&s;s lie. The ground-work of the tragedy of Xuthus is a lying oracle, declaring Ion, &s;on of Apollo and Creu&s;a, to be the &s;on of Xuthus. Ore&s;tes in Euripides, having &s;lain his mother Clytemne&s;tra, excu&s;es him&s;elf as having been mi&s;led by Apollo to com|mit the crime. <Q REND="inline">"Ah!"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"had I con|&s;ulted the gho&s;t of my father, he would have di&s;&s;uaded me from a crime that has proved my ruin, without doing him any good."</Q> He con|cludes with ob&s;erving, that having acted by Apol|lo's command, Apollo is the only criminal. In a tragedy of Sophocles, Minerva makes no diffi|culty to cheat Ajax, by promi&s;ing to be his friend, while underhand &s;he is &s;erving Uly&s;&s;es, his bitter enemy. Mercury, in revenge for the mur|der of his &s;on Myrtilus, entails cur&s;es on Pelops the murderer, and on all his race<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Engli&s;h tran&s;lator of that tragedy, ob&s;erves it to be remarkable in the Grecian creed, that the gods puni&s;h the crimes of men upon their innocent po&s;terity.</NOTE>. In general, the gods, every where in Greek tragedies, are partial, unju&s;t, tyrannical, and revengeful. The Greeks accordingly have no re&s;erve in maltreat|ing their gods. In the tragedy of Prometheus, Jupiter, without the lea&s;t ceremony, is accu&s;ed of being an u&s;urper. E&s;chylus proclaims pub|licly on the &s;tage, that Jupiter, a jealous, cruel, and implacable tyrant, had overturned every thing in heaven; and that the other gods were reduced to be his &s;laves. In the Iliad, book 13. Mene|laus addre&s;&s;es Jupiter in the following words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O father Jove! in wi&s;dom, they &s;ay, thou excelle&s;t both men and gods. Yet all the&s;e

ills proceed from thee; for the wicked thou do&s;t aid in war.

No|thing is more common, than to introduce them as actors in Greek tragedies; frequently for tri|vial purpo&s;es: Apollo comes upon the &s;tage mo&s;t courteou&s;ly to acquaint the audience with the &s;ubject of the play.

One of the harde&s;t mor&s;els to dige&s;t in Plato's philo&s;ophy, was his doctrine, That God is incorporeal; which by many was thought ab|&s;urd, for that, without a body, he could not have &s;en&s;es, nor prudence, nor plea&s;ure. The religious creed of the Romans &s;eems to have been little le&s;s impure than that of the Greeks. It was a ceremony of theirs, in be&s;ieging a town, to evocate the tutelar deity, and to tempt him by a reward to betray his friends and votaries.

<P>A divi&s;ion of invi&s;ible beings into benevolent and malevolent, without any mixture of the&s;e qualities, makes the fourth &s;tage. The talents and feelings of men, refine gradually under good government: &s;ocial amu&s;ements begin to make a figure: benevolence is highly regarded; and &s;ome men are found without gall. Having thus acqui|red a notion of pure benevolence, and finding it exemplified in &s;ome per&s;ons, it was an ea&s;y &s;tep in the progre&s;s of theological opinions, to be&s;tow the &s;ame character upon &s;ome &s;uperior beings. This led men to di&s;tingui&s;h their gods into two kinds, e&s;&s;entially different; one entirely benevo|lent, another entirely malevolent; and the diffe|rence between good and ill, which are diametri|cally oppo&s;ite, favoured that di&s;tinction. For|tunate events out of the common cour&s;e of na|ture, were accordingly a&s;cribed to benevolent de|ities; and unfortunate events of that kind, to
<PB N="150" REF="154">
malevolent. In the time of Pliny the elder, ma|levolent deities were wor&s;hipped at Rome. He mentions a temple dedicated to <HI>Bad Fortune,</HI> ano|ther to the di&s;ea&s;e termed a <HI>Fever.</HI> The Lace|demonians wor&s;hipped <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> and the people of Cadiz <HI>Poverty</HI> and <HI>Old Age;</HI> in order to deprecate their wrath. Such gods were by the Romans termed <HI>Averrunci,</HI> as putting away evil.</P>
<P>Conviction of one &s;upreme benevolent Deity, and of inferior deities, &s;ome benevolent, &s;ome malevolent, is the fifth &s;tage. Such conviction, which gains ground in proportion as morality ri|pens, ari&s;es from a remarkable difference be|tween gratitude and fear. Willing to &s;how my gratitude for &s;ome kindne&s;s proceeding from an unknown hand, &s;everal per&s;ons occur to my con|jectures; but I always fix at la&s;t upon one per&s;on as the mo&s;t likely. Fear is of an oppo&s;ite nature: it expands it&s;elf upon every &s;u&s;picious per&s;on, and blackens them all equally. Thus, upon pro|vidential good fortune above the power of man, we naturally re&s;t upon one benevolent Deity as the cau&s;e; and to him we confine our gratitude and veneration. When, on the other hand, we are &s;truck with an uncommon calamity, every thing that po&s;&s;ibly may be the cau&s;e, rai&s;es terror in us. Hence the propen&s;ity in &s;avages to multi|ply objects of fear; but to confine their grati|tude and veneration to a &s;ingle object. Grati|tude and veneration, at the &s;ame time, are of &s;uch a nature, as to rai&s;e a high opinion of the per&s;on who is their object; and when a &s;ingle in|vi&s;ible being is under&s;tood to pour out ble&s;&s;ings with a liberal hand, good men, inflamed with gratitude, put no bounds to the power and bene|volence of that being. And thus one &s;upreme benevolent Deity comes to be recogni&s;ed among the more enlightened &s;avages. With re&s;pect to

<P>The belief of one &s;upreme benevolent Deity, and of &s;ubordinate deities benevolent and male|volent, is and has been more univer&s;al than any other religious creed.

They hold the exi&s;tence of one &s;upreme Deity, who&s;e chief attribute is benevolence; and to him they a&s;cribe every good that happens.

and of every misfortune. To the&s;e de|vils termed in their language <HI>Yowahoos,</HI> they di|rect every &s;upplication, in order to avert their malevolence; while the &s;upreme Deity is entire|ly neglected: &s;o much more powerful among &s;a|vage&s;, is fear than gratitude. The North-Ame|rican &s;avages have all of them a notion of a &s;u|preme Deity, creator and governor of the world, and of inferior deities, &s;ome good, &s;ome ill. The&s;e are &s;uppo&s;ed to have bodies, and to live much as men do, but without being &s;ubjected to any di&s;tre&s;s. The &s;ame creed prevails among the negroes of Benin and Congo, among the people of New Zeland, among the inhabitants of Java, of Madaga&s;car, of the Molucca i&s;lands, and of the Caribbee i&s;lands. The Chingule&s;e, a tribe in the i&s;land of Ceylon, acknowledge one God creator of the univer&s;e, with &s;ubordinate deities who act as his deputies: agriculture is the pecu|liar province of one, navigation of another. The creed of the Tonquine&s;e is nearly the &s;ame. The inhabitants of Otaheite, termed <HI>King George's i&s;land,</HI> believe in one &s;upreme Deity; and in inferior deities without end, who pre&s;ide over particular parts of the creation. They pay no adoration to the &s;upreme Deity, thinking him too far elevated above his creatures to concern him&s;elf with what they do. They believe the &s;tars to be children of the &s;un and moon, and an eclip&s;e to be the time of copulation. According to Arnobius, certain Roman deities pre&s;ided over the various operations of men. Venus pre&s;ided over carnal copulation; Puta a&s;&s;i&s;ted at pruning trees; and Peta in reque&s;ting benefits; Neme&s;|trinus was god of the woods, Nodutus ripened corn, and Teren&s;is helped to thre&s;h it; Vibilia a&s;&s;i&s;ted travellers; orphans were under the care of Orbona, and dying per&s;ons, of Naenia; O&s;&s;i|lago

hardened the bones of infants; and Mellonia protected bees, and be&s;towed &s;weetne&s;s on their honey.

The bulk of their inferior deities are the &s;ouls of upright men, who are con|&s;tantly doing good, and the &s;ouls of wicked men, who are con&s;tantly doing ill.

<P>The &s;ixth &s;tage is, the belief of one &s;upreme benevolent Deity, as in that immediately forego|ing, with many inferior benevolent deities, and one only who is malevolent. As men improve in natural knowledge, and become &s;kilful in tra|cing cau&s;es from effects, they find much le&s;s ma|lice and ill-de&s;ign than was imagined: humanity at la&s;t prevails, which, in connection with im|proved knowledge, bani&s;hes the &s;u&s;picion of ill-de&s;ign, in every ca&s;e where an event can po&s;&s;ibly be explained without it. In a word, a &s;ettled opinion of good prevailing in the world, produ|ced conviction among &s;ome nations, le&s;s ignorant than their neighbours, and le&s;s brutal, that there is but one malevolent &s;ubordinate deity, and good &s;ubordinate deities without number. The anci|ent Per&s;ians acknowledged two principles; one all good and all powerful, named <HI>Hormuz,</HI> and by the Greeks corruptly <HI>Oromazes;</HI> the other evil, named <HI>Ahariman,</HI> and by the Greeks <HI>Ari|manes.</HI> Some authors a&s;&s;ert, that the Per&s;ians held the&s;e two principles to be coeternal: others, that Oromazes fir&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;ted alone, that he crea|ted both light and darkne&s;s, and that he created Arimanes out of darkne&s;s. That the latter was

the opinion of the ancient Per&s;ians, appears from their Bible, termed the <HI>Sadder;</HI> which teaches, That there is one God &s;upreme over all, many good angels, and but one evil &s;pirit. Plutarch acquaints us, that Hormuz and Ahariman, for ever at variance, formed, each of them, crea|tures of their own &s;tamp; that the former creat|ed good genii, &s;uch as goodne&s;s, truth, wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice; and that the latter created evil genii, &s;uch as infidelity, fal&s;ehood, oppre&s;&s;ion, theft. This &s;y&s;tem of theology, commonly termed the <HI>Manichean &s;y&s;tem,</HI> is &s;aid to be al&s;o the religious creed of Pegu, with the following addition, that the evil principle only is to be wor&s;hiped; which is abundantly probable, as fear is a predominant pa&s;&s;ion in barbarians. The people of Florida be|lieve a &s;upreme benevolent Deity, and a &s;ubordi|nate deity that is malevolent: neglecting the for|mer, who, they &s;ay, does no harm, they bend their whole attention to &s;often the latter, who, they &s;ay, torments them day and night. The in|habitants of Darian acknowledge but one evil &s;pi|rit, of whom they are de&s;perately afraid. The Hottentots, mentioned by &s;ome writers as altoge|ther de&s;titute of religion, are, on the contrary, farther advanced toward its purity, than &s;ome of their neighbours. Their creed is, That there is a &s;upreme being, who is goodne&s;s it&s;elf; of whom they have no occa&s;ion to &s;tand in awe, as he is incapable by his nature to hurt them; that there is al&s;o a malevolent &s;pirit, &s;ubordinate to the former, who mu&s;t be &s;erved and wor&s;hipped in order to avert his malice. The epicurean doc|trine with re&s;pect to the gods in general, That being happy in them&s;elves, they extend not their providential care to men, differs not widely from what the Hottentot believes with re&s;pect to the &s;upreme being.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="160">
Having traced the &s;en&s;e of deity, from its dawn in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;avages, to its approaching maturity among enlightened nations, we proceed to the la&s;t &s;tage of the progre&s;s, which makes the true &s;y&s;tem of theology; and that is, con|viction of a &s;upreme being, boundle&s;s in every perfection, without any &s;ubordinate deities, be|nevolent or malevolent. Savages learn early to trace the chain of cau&s;es and effects, with re&s;|pect to ordinary events: they know that fa&s;ting produces hunger, that labour occa&s;ions wearine&s;s, that fire burns, that the &s;un and rain contribute to vegetation. But when they go beyond &s;uch familiar events, they lo&s;e &s;ight of cau&s;e and ef|fect: the changes of weather, of winds, of heat and cold, impre&s;s them with a notion of chance: earthquakes, hurricanes, &s;torms of thunder and lightning, which fill them with terror, are a&s;|cribed to malignant beings of greater power than man. In the progre&s;s of knowledge, light be|gins to break in upon them: they di&s;cover, that &s;uch phenomena, however tremendous, come under the general law of cau&s;e and effect, and that there is no ground for a&s;cribing them to malignant &s;pirits. At the &s;ame time, our more refined &s;en&s;es ripen by degrees: &s;ocial affections come to prevail; and morality makes a deep im|pre&s;&s;ion. In maturity of &s;en&s;e and under&s;tand|ing, benevolence appears more and more; and beautiful final cau&s;es are di&s;covered in many of nature's productions, that formerly were thought u&s;ele&s;s, or perhaps de&s;tructive: and the time may come, we have &s;olid ground to hope that it will come, when doubts and difficulties about the government of Providence, will all of them be cleared up; and every event be found condu|cive to the general good. Such views of Provi|dence bani&s;h malevolent deities; and we &s;ettle at
<PB N="157" REF="161">
la&s;t in a mo&s;t comfortable opinion; either that there are no &s;uch beings; or that, if they exi&s;t and are permitted to perpetrate any mi&s;chief, it is in order to produce greater good. Thus, through a long maze of errors, man arrives at true religion, acknowledging but one Being, &s;u|preme in power, intelligence, and benevolence, who created all other beings, to whom all other beings are &s;ubjected, and who directs every e|vent to an&s;wer the be&s;t purpo&s;es. This &s;y&s;tem is true theology<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny &s;eems to reli&s;h the doctrine of unity in the Deity; but is at a lo&s;s about forming any ju&s;t concep|tion of him, &s;ometimes con&s;idering the world to be our only deity, &s;ometimes the &s;un.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having gone through the different &s;tages of re|ligious belief, in its gradual progre&s;s toward truth and purity, I proceed to a very important article, viz. The hi&s;tory of tutelar deities. The belief of tutelar deities preceded indeed &s;everal of the &s;tages mentioned, witne&s;s the tutelar deities of Greece and Rome; but as it is not connected with any one of them exclu&s;ive of the re&s;t, the clearne&s;s of method required it to be po&s;tponed to all of them. This belief, founded on &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, made a rapid progre&s;s after property in the goods of fortune was e&s;tabli&s;hed. The Greeks, the Ro|mans, and indeed mo&s;t nations that were not mere &s;avages, appropriated to them&s;elves tutelar deities, who were under&s;tood to befriend them upon all occa&s;ions; and, in particular, to fight for them again&s;t their enemies. The Iliad of Homer is full of miraculous battles between the Greeks and Trojans, the tutelar deities mixing with the contending parties, and partaking of every di&s;|a&s;ter, death only excepted, which immortals could

not &s;uffer. The <HI>lares, penates,</HI> or hou&s;ehold|gods, of Indo&s;tan, of Greece, and of Rome, bear witne&s;s, that every family, perhaps every per&s;on, was thought to be under the protection of a tute|lar deity. Alexander ab Alexandro gives a li&s;t of tutelar deities. Apollo and Minerva were the tutelar deities of Athens; Bacchus and Hercules of the Boeotian Thebes; Juno of Carthage, Samos, Sparta, Argos, and Mycen&eacute;; Venus of Cyprus; Apollo of Rhodes, and of Delphos; Vulcan of Lemons; Bacchus of Naxus; Nep|tune of Tenedos, &amp;c. The poets te&s;tify, that even individuals had tutelar deities:<Q><L>Mulciber in Trojam, pro Troja &s;tabat Apollo:</L>

man has a tutelar deity of his own termed <HI>Manitou,</HI> who is con&s;tantly invoked during war to give him victory over his enemies. The Natches, bordering on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, offer up the &s;kulls of their enemies to their god, and depo&s;ite them in his temple. They con&s;ider that being as their tutelar deity who a&s;&s;i&s;ts them again&s;t their ene|mies, and to whom therefore the &s;kull of an enemy mu&s;t be an acceptable offering. Though they wor&s;hip the &s;un, who impartially &s;hines on all mankind; yet &s;uch is their partiality, that they con&s;ider them&s;elves as his cho&s;en people, and that their enemies are his ene|mies.</P>
<P>A belief &s;o ab&s;urd &s;hows woful imbecility in human nature. Is it not obvious, that the great God of heaven and earth, governs the world by inflexible laws, from whence he never can &s;werve in any ca&s;e, becau&s;e they are the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible in every ca&s;e? To &s;uppo&s;e any family or nation to be an object of his peculiar love, is no le&s;s impi|ous, than to &s;uppo&s;e any family or nation to be an object of his peculiar hatred: they equally ar|raign Providence of partiality. Even the Goths had more ju&s;t notions of the Deity. Totila, re|commending to his people ju&s;tice and humanity, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Quare &s;ic habete, ea quae amari ab hominibus &s;olent ita vobis &s;alva fore, &s;i ju&s;titiae reverentiam &s;ervaveritis.

That God was once the tutelar deity of the Jews, is true; but not in the vulgar acceptation of that term, importing a deity cho&s;en by a peo|ple to be their patron and protector. The ortho|dox faith is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That God cho&s;e the Jews as his peculiar people, not from any partiality to them, but that there might be one nation to keep alive the knowledge of one &s;upreme Deity; which &s;hould be pro&s;perous while they adhered to him, and unpro&s;perous when they declined to idolatry; not only in order to make them per&s;evere in the true faith, but al&s;o in order to exemplify to all nations the conduct of his Providence."</Q> It is certain, however, that the perver&s;e Jews claimed God Almighty as their tutelar deity, in the vulgar acceptation of the term. And this error throws light upon an inci|dent related in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles. There was a prophecy firmly believed by the Jews, that the Me&s;&s;iah would come among them in per&s;on to re&s;tore their kingdom.

At the &s;ame time, as the Jews held all other nations in abhorrence, it was natural for them to conclude, that the Me&s;&s;iah would be &s;ent to them only, God's cho&s;en people; for which rea&s;on, even the apo&s;tles were at fir&s;t doubtful

But the apo&s;tles reflecting, that it was one great purpo&s;e of the mi&s;&s;ion, to bani&s;h from the Jews their groveling and impure notion of a tutelar deity, and to proclaim a &s;tate of future happine&s;s to all who believe in Chri&s;t, they pro|ceeded to preach the go&s;pel to all men: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then Peter opened his mouth, and &s;aid, Of a truth I perceive, that God is no re&s;pecter of per|&s;ons: but in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted with him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Acts of the Apo&s;tles, x. 34.</NOTE>."</Q> The foregoing rea&s;oning, however, did not &s;atisfy the Jews: they could not dige&s;t the opinion, that God &s;ent his Me&s;&s;iah to &s;ave all nations; and that he was the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews. They &s;tormed again&s;t Paul in particular for inculcating that doc|trine<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Acts of the Apo&s;tles, chap. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that religion in its purity was e&s;tab|li&s;hed by the go&s;pel, is it not amazing, that even Chri&s;tians fell back to the wor&s;hip of tutelar deities? They did not indeed adopt the ab&s;urd opinion, that the &s;upreme Being was their tutelar deity: but they held, that there are divine per|&s;ons &s;ubordinate to the Almighty, who take under their care nations, families, and even individuals; an opinion that differs not e&s;&s;entially from that of tutelar deities among the Heathens. That opini|on, which flatters &s;elf-love, took root in the fifth century, when the deification of &s;aints was intro|duced,
<PB N="162" REF="166">
&s;imilar to the deification of heroes among the ancients. With regard to matters &s;piritual, as well as temporal, people are fond of friends to be their interce&s;&s;ors; and with regard to the Deity, deified &s;aints were thought the propere&s;t inter|ce&s;&s;ors. Temples were built and dedicated to them, and &s;olemn rites of wor&s;hip in&s;tituted to render them propitious. It was imagined, that the &s;ouls of deified &s;aints are at liberty to roam where they li&s;t, and that they love the places where their bodies are interred; which accordingly made the &s;epulchres of the &s;aints a common ren|dezvous of &s;upplicants. What paved the way to notions &s;o ab&s;urd, was the gro&s;s ignorance that clouded the Chri&s;tian world after the northern barbarians became ma&s;ters of Europe. In the &s;eventh century, the bi&s;hops were &s;o illiterate as to be indebted to others for the &s;hallow &s;ermons they preached; and the very few of that order who had any learning, &s;atisfied them&s;elves with com|po&s;ing in&s;ipid homilies, collected from the wri|tings of Augu&s;tin and Gregory. In the ninth century, matters grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e; for the&s;e &s;aints, held at fir&s;t to be mediators for Chri&s;tians in general, were now converted into tutelar deities in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e. An opinion prevailed, that &s;uch &s;aints as are occupied about the &s;ouls of Chri&s;tians in general, have little time for indivi|duals; which led every church, and every pri|vate Chri&s;tian, to elect for them&s;elves a particular &s;aint, as their peculiar patron or tutelar deity. That practice made it nece&s;&s;ary to deify &s;aints without end, in order to furni&s;h a tutelar deity to every individual. The dubbing of &s;aints, became a new &s;ource of abu&s;es and frauds in the Chri&s;tian world: lying wonders were invented, and fabulous hi&s;tories compo&s;ed, to celebrate exploits that never were performed, and to glorify per&s;ons that never
<PB N="163" REF="167">
had a being. And thus religion among Chri&s;tians, &s;unk down into as low a &s;tate as it had been among Pagans.</P>
<P>There &s;till remains upon hand a capital branch of our hi&s;tory; and that is idolatry, which pro|perly &s;ignifies the wor&s;hipping vi&s;ible objects as deities. But as idolatry evidently &s;prung from religious wor&s;hip, corrupted by the igno|rant and bruti&s;h, it will make its appearance with more advantage in the next &s;ection, of which religious wor&s;hip is the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>We have thus traced with wary &s;teps, the gra|dual progre&s;s of theology through many &s;tages, corre&s;ponding to the gradual openings and im|provements of the human mind. But though that progre&s;s in almo&s;t all countries appears uni|form with re&s;pect to the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, it is far otherwi&s;e with re&s;pect to the quickne&s;s of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion: nations, like individuals, make a pro|gre&s;s from infancy to maturity; but they advance not with an equal pace, &s;ome making a rapid cour&s;e toward perfection in knowledge and in re|ligion, while others remain ignorant barbarians. The religion of Hindo&s;tan, if we credit hi&s;tory or tradition, had advanced to a con&s;iderable de|gree of purity and refinement, at a very early pe|riod. The Hindo&s;tan Bible, termed <HI>Chatahbhade</HI> or <HI>Sha&s;tah,</HI> gives an account of the creation, lap&s;e of the angels, and creation of man; in&s;tructs us in the unity of the Deity, but denies his pre|&s;cience as being incon&s;i&s;tent with free-will in man; all of them profound doctrines of an illu|minated people; to e&s;tabli&s;h which a long cour&s;e of time mu&s;t have been requi&s;ite, after wandering through errors without number. Compared with the Hindows in theology, even the Greeks were mere &s;avages. The Grecian gods were held to be little better than men, and their hi&s;tory, as
<PB N="164" REF="168">
above mentioned, corre&s;ponds to the notion en|tertained of them.</P>
<P>In explaining the opinions of men with re&s;pect to Deity, I have confined my view to &s;uch opi|nions as are &s;ugge&s;ted by principles or bia&s;&s;es that make a part of common nature; omitting many whim&s;ical notions, no better than dreams of a roving imagination. The plan delineated &s;hows wonderful uniformity in the progre&s;s of religion through all nations. That the whim&s;ical notions mentioned are far otherwi&s;e, is not wonderful. Take the following &s;pecimen. The Kam&s;katkans are not &s;o &s;tupidly ignorant, as to be altogether void of curio&s;ity. They &s;ometimes think of na|tural appearances.&mdash;Rain, &s;ay they, is &s;ome de|ity pi&s;&s;ing upon them; and they imagine the rain|bow to be a party-coloured garment, put on by him in preparing for that operation. They be|lieve wind to be produced by a god &s;haking his long hair about his head with violence. Such tales will &s;carce amu&s;e children in the nur&s;ery. The inhabitants of the i&s;land Celebes formerly acknowledged no gods but the &s;un and the moon, which were held to be eternal. Ambition for &s;uperiority made them fall out. The moon being wounded in flying from the &s;un, was delivered of the earth.</P>
<P>Hitherto of the gradual openings of the human mind with re&s;pect to Deity. I clo&s;e this &s;ection with an account of &s;ome un&s;ound notions concern|ing the conduct of Providence, and concerning &s;ome &s;peculative matters. I begin with the for|mer.</P>
<P>In days of ignorance, the conduct of Providence is very little under&s;tood. Far from having any notion, than the government of this world is carried on by general laws, which are inflexible becau&s;e they are the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible, every impor|tant

event is attributed to an immediate interpo|&s;ition of the Deity. As the Grecian gods were thought to have bodies like men, and like men to require nouri&s;hment; they were imagined to act like men, forming &s;hort-&s;ighted plans of operati|on, and varying them from time to time according to exigencies. Even the wi&s;e Athenians, had an utter aver&s;ion for philo&s;ophers who attempted to account for effects by general laws: &s;uch doc|trine they thought tended to fetter the gods, and to prevent them from governing events at their plea&s;ure. An eclip&s;e being held to be a progno&s;|tic given by the gods of &s;ome grievous calamity, Anaxagoras was accu&s;ed of Athei&s;m for attempt|ing to explain the eclip&s;e of the moon by natural cau&s;es: he was thrown into pri&s;on, and with dif|ficulty was relieved by the influence of Pericles. Protagoras was bani&s;hed Athens for maintaining the &s;ame doctrine. Procopius overflows with &s;ignal interpo&s;itions of Providence; and Agathias, beginning at the battle of Marathon, &s;agely main|tains, that from that time downward, there was not a battle lo&s;t, but by an immediate judgment of God, for the &s;ins of the commander, or of his army, or of one per&s;on or other. Our Savi|our's doctrine with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who &s;uffered by the fall of the tower of Siloam, ought to have opened their eyes; but &s;uper&s;titious eyes are never opened by in&s;truction. At the &s;ame time, it is deplorable that &s;uch belief has no good in|fluence on manners: on the contrary, never doth wickedne&s;s &s;o much abound as in dark times. A curious fact is related by Procopius<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toria Gothica, lib. 1.</NOTE> with re|&s;pect to that &s;ort of &s;uper&s;tition. When Rome was be&s;ieged by the Goths, and in danger of de|&s;truction,
<PB N="166" REF="170">
a part of the town-wall, declining from the perpendicular, was in a tottering condi|tion. Beli&s;arius, propo&s;ing to fortify it, was op|po&s;ed by the citizens, affirming, that it was guarded by St. Peter. Procopius ob&s;erves, that the event an&s;wered expectation; for that the Goths, during a tedious &s;iege, never once at|tempted that weak part. He adds, that the wall remained in the &s;ame ruinous &s;tate at the time of his writing. Here is a curious conceit:&mdash;Peter created a tutelar deity, able and willing, for the &s;ake of his votaries, to counteract the laws by which God governs the material world. And for what mighty benefit to them? Only to &s;ave them five or fifty pounds in rebuilding the crazy part of the wall.</P>
<P>It is no le&s;s incon&s;i&s;tent with the regular cour&s;e of Providence, to believe, as many formerly did, that in all doubtful ca&s;es the Almighty, when appealed to, never fails to interpo&s;e in fa|vour of the right &s;ide. The inhabitants of Con|&s;tantinople, ann. 1284, being &s;plit into parties about two contending patriarchs, the Emperor ordered a fire to be made in the church of St So|phia, and a memorial from each party to be thrown into it; never doubting, but that God would &s;ave from the flames the memorial of the party who&s;e cau&s;e he e&s;pou&s;ed. But, to the ut|ter a&s;toni&s;hment of all beholders, the flames paid not the lea&s;t regard to either of the memorials. The &s;ame ab&s;urd opinion gave birth to the trial by fire, by water, and by &s;ingular battle. And it is not a little remarkable, that &s;uch trials were common among many nations that had no inter|cour&s;e one with another: even the enlightened people of Indo&s;tan try crimes by dipping the hand of a &s;u&s;pected per&s;on in boiling oil.&mdash;Such uni|formity is there with re&s;pect even to &s;uper&s;titious
<PB N="167" REF="171">
opinions. Pope Gregory VII. in&s;i&s;ting, that the Kings of Ca&s;tile and Aragon &s;hould lay a&s;ide their Gothic liturgy for the Romi&s;h, the matter was put to trial by &s;ingular battle; and two champions were cho&s;en, to declare by victory the opinion of God Almighty. The Emperor Otho I. ob&s;erving the doctors to differ about a a point of law, viz. the right of repre&s;entation in land-e&s;tates, appointed a duel; and the right of repre&s;entation gained the victory. If any thing can render &s;uch a doctrine palatable, it is the be|lieving in a tutelar deity, who with le&s;s ab&s;urdity may interpo&s;e in behalf of a favourite opinion, or of a favourite people. Appian gravely reports, that when the city of Rhodes was be&s;ieged by Mithridates, a &s;tatue of the godde&s;s I&s;is was &s;een to dart flames of fire upon a bulky engine, rai&s;ed by the be&s;iegers to overtop the wall.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torians mention an incident that happened in the i&s;land Celebes, founded on a belief of the &s;ame kind with that above mentioned. About two centuries ago, &s;ome Chri&s;tian and &s;ome Ma|hometan mi&s;&s;ionaries made their way to that i&s;land. The chief king, &s;truck with the fear of hell taught by both, a&s;&s;embled a general council; and extending his hands toward heaven, addre&s;|&s;ed the following prayer to the &s;upreme being. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Great God, from thee I demand nothing but ju&s;tice, and to me thou owe&s;t it. Men of dif|ferent religions have come to this i&s;land, threatening eternal puni&s;hment to me and my people if we di&s;obey thy laws. What are thy laws? Speak, O my God, who art the au|thor of nature: thou knowe&s;t the bottom of our hearts, and that we can never intentionally di&s;obey thee. But if it be unworthy of thy e&s;&s;ence to employ the language of men, I call upon my whole people, the &s;un which gives
<PB N="168" REF="172">
me light, the earth which bears me, the &s;ea which &s;urrounds my empire, and upon thee thy&s;elf, to bear witne&s;s for me, that in the &s;incerity of my heart I wi&s;h to know thy will; and this day I declare, that I will ac|knowledge as the depo&s;itaries of thy oracles, the fir&s;t mini&s;ters of either religion that &s;hall land on this i&s;land."</Q></P>
<P>It is equally erroneous to believe, that certain ceremonies will protect one from mi&s;chief. In the dark ages of Chri&s;tianity, the &s;igning with the figure of a cro&s;s, was held not only to be an antidote again&s;t the &s;nares of malignant &s;pirits, but to in&s;pire re&s;olution for &s;upporting trials and calamities: for which rea&s;on no Chri&s;tian in tho&s;e days undertook any thing of moment, till he had u&s;ed that ceremony. It was firmly believed in France, that a gold or &s;ilver coin of St Louis, hung from the neck, was a protection again&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es: and we find accordingly a hole in every remaining coin of that king, for fixing it to a ri|band. In the minority of Charles VIII. of France the three e&s;tates, ann. 1484, &s;upplicated his Maje&s;ty, that he would no longer defer the being anointed with the holy oil, as the favour of Hea|ven was vi&s;ibly connected with that ceremony. They affirmed, that his grandfather Charles VII. never pro&s;pered till he was anointed; and that Heaven afterward fought on his &s;ide, till the En|gli&s;h were expelled out of his kingdom. The high altar of St Margaret's church in the i&s;land of Icolmkill, was covered with a plate of blue marble finely veined; which has &s;uffered from a &s;uper&s;titious conceit, that the &s;malle&s;t bit of it will pre&s;erve a &s;hip from &s;inking. It has accor|dingly been carried off piece-meal; and at pre|&s;ent there is &s;carce enough left-to make an experi|ment. In the Sadder, certain prayers are enjoin|ed

when one &s;neezes or pi&s;&s;es, in order to cha&s;e away the devil. Cart-wheels in Li&s;bon are compo&s;ed of two boards clum&s;ily cut in a cir|cular form, and nailed together. Though the noi&s;e is intolerable, yet the axles are never grea|&s;ed, becau&s;e the noi&s;e, &s;ay they, frightens the devil from hurting their oxen.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;o far has &s;uper&s;tition been carried, as to found a belief, that the devil by magic can control the cour&s;e of Providence. A Greek bi|&s;hop having dreamed, that a certain miracle had failed by magic, the &s;uppo&s;ed magician and his &s;on were condemned to die, without the lea&s;t evi|dence but the dream. Monte&s;quieu collects a number of circum&s;tances, each of which, though all extremely improbable, ought to have been clearly made out, in order to prove the crime<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">L'E&s;prit des loix, lib. 12. ch. 5.</NOTE>. The Emperor Theodore La&s;caris, imagi|ning magic to be the cau&s;e of his di&s;temper, put the per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected to the trial of holding a red-hot iron without being burnt. In the capi|tularies of Charlemagne, in the canons of &s;eve|ral councils, and in the ancient laws of Norway puni&s;hments are enacted again&s;t tho&s;e who are &s;uppo&s;ed able to rai&s;e tempe&s;ts, <HI>Tempe&s;tarii.</HI> During the time of Catharine de Medicis, in the court of France there was a jumble of politics, gallantry, luxury, debauchery, &s;uper&s;tition, and Athei&s;m. It was common to take the re&s;em|blance of enemies in wax, in order to torment them by roa&s;ting the figure at a &s;low fire, and pricking it with needles. If an enemy happened in one in&s;tance of a thou&s;and to pine and die, the charm was e&s;tabli&s;hed for ever. Sorcery and witchcraft were &s;o univer&s;ally believed in En|gland,

that in a preamble to a &s;tatute of Henry VIII. ann. 1511, it is &s;et forth, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That &s;miths, weavers, and women, boldly take upon them great cures, in which they partly u&s;e &s;orcery, and witchcraft."</Q> The fir&s;t printers, who were Germans, having carried their books to Pa|ris for &s;ale, were condemned by the parliament to be burnt alive as &s;orcerers; and did not e&s;cape puni&s;hment but by a precipitant flight. It had indeed much the appearance of &s;orcery, that a man could write &s;o many copies of a book, with|out the &s;lighte&s;t variation.</P>
<P>There are many examples of extraordinary vir|tues being attributed to certain things, in them|&s;elves of no &s;ignificancy. The Hungarians were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a golden crown, &s;ent from heaven with the peculiar virtue, as they believed, of be&s;tow|ing upon the per&s;on who wore it, an undoubted title to be their king.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t extraordinary effort of ab&s;urd &s;u|per&s;tition, is a per&s;ua&s;ion, that one may control the cour&s;e of Providence, by making a down|right bargain with God Almighty to receive from him <HI>quid pro quo.</HI> A herd of Tartars in Siberia, named by the Ru&s;&s;ians <HI>Baravin&s;koi,</HI> have in every hut a wooden idol, termed in their language <HI>Shei|tan,</HI> about eighteen inches high, to which they addre&s;s their prayers for plenty of game in hunt|ing, promi&s;ing to give it, if &s;ucce&s;sful, a new coat or a new bonnet: a &s;ort of bargain abun|dantly bruti&s;h; and yet more excu&s;able in mere &s;avages, than what is made with the Virgin Ma|ry by enlightened Roman Catholics; who, upon condition of her relieving them from di&s;tre&s;s, promi&s;e her a waxen taper to burn on her altar. Philip II. of Spain made a vow, that, upon con|dition of gaining the battle of St Quintin, he would build the Mona&s;tery of E&s;curial; as if an

Be&s;ide the ab&s;urdity of think|ing that &s;uch vows can have the effect to alter the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of Providence, they betray a mo&s;t contemptible notion of the Deity, as if his favours, like a hor&s;e, or a cow, could be pur|cha&s;ed with money.</P>
<P>But however loo&s;e and disjointed, events ap|pear to the ignorant, when viewed as pa&s;t, or as pa&s;&s;ing, future events take on a very differert appearance. The doctrine of progno&s;tics is evidently founded upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that fu|ture events are unalterably fixed; for otherwi&s;e that doctrine would appear ab&s;urd, even to the mo&s;t ignorant. There is no bias in human na|ture that has greater influence, than curio&s;ity about futurity; which in dark ages governs with|out control: men with no le&s;s folly than indu&s;try have ran&s;acked the earth, the &s;ea, the air, and even the &s;tars, for progno&s;tics of future events. The Greeks had their oracles, the Romans their augurs, and all the world their omens. The Grecian oracles and Roman auguries are evi|dently built upon their belief of tutelar deities; and the numberle&s;s omens that influence weak people in every country, &s;eem to re&s;t upon the

&s;ame foundation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is no wonder that the Romans were &s;uper&s;titi|ou&s;ly addicted to omens and auguries: like mere &s;a|vages, they put no value upon any &s;cience but that of war; and, for that rea&s;on, they bani&s;hed all philo&s;o|phers, as u&s;ele&s;s members of &s;ociety. Thus, that nation, &s;o fierce and &s;o great in war, &s;urrendered them&s;elves blindly to &s;uper&s;tition, and became &s;laves to imaginary evils. Even their grave&s;t hi&s;torians were deeply tainted with that di&s;ea&s;e.</NOTE>. Ancient hi&s;tories are &s;tuffed with omens, prodigies, and progno&s;tics: Livy overflows with fooleries of that kind. Endle&s;s are the adver&s;e omens reported by Appian of Alexandria, that are &s;aid to have given warn|ing of the defeat of Cra&s;&s;us by the Parthians; and no fewer in number are tho&s;e which hap|pened at the death of the Emperor Hadrian, if we believe Spartianus. Lampridius, with great gravity, recites the omens which progno&s;ticated that Alexander Severus would be Emperor: he was born the &s;ame day on which Alexander the Great died: he was brought forth in a temple de|dicated to Alexander the Great: he was named <HI>Alexander;</HI> and an old woman gave to his mother, a pigeon's egg of a purple colour produced on his birth-day. A comet is an infallible progno&s;tic of the death of a king. But of what king? Why, of the king who dies next. Suetonius, with the &s;olem|nity of a pulpit-in&s;tructor, informs us, that the death of the Emperor Claudius was predicted by a comet; and of Tiberius, by the fall of a tower during an earthquake. Such opinions, which indeed have &s;ome foundation in our na|ture, take fa&s;t hold of the mind, when envigo|rated by education and example. Even philo|&s;ophy is not &s;ufficient to eradicate them but by &s;low degrees: witne&s;s Tacitus, the mo&s;t pro|found

<P>With re&s;pect to prophecies in particular, one appology may be made for them, that no other progno&s;tic of futurity is le&s;s apt to do mi&s;chief. What Procopius<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gothica Hi&s;toria, lib. 1.</NOTE> ob&s;erves of the Sybilline oracles, is equally applicable to prophecies in general, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it is above the &s;agacity of man to explain any of them before the event hap|pen."</Q> After peru&s;ing many, he gives the following rea&s;on, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Matters are there handled,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not in any order, nor in a continued di&s;cour&s;e: but after mentioning the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Africa, for example, they give a &s;light touch at the Per&s;ians, the Romans, the A&s;&s;y|rians; then returning to the Romans, they fall &s;lap-da&s;h upon the calamities of Britain."</Q> A curious example of this ob&s;ervation, is a book of prophecies compo&s;ed in Scotland by Thomas Learmont, commonly called <HI>Thomas the Rhymer,</HI> becau&s;e the book is in rhyme. Plutarch, in the life of Cicero, reports, that a &s;pectre appeared to Cicero's nur&s;e, and foretold, that the child would become a great &s;upport to the Roman
<PB N="175" REF="179">
&s;tate; and mo&s;t innocently he makes the follow|ing reflection: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This might have pa&s;&s;ed for an idle tale, had not Cicero demon&s;trated the truth of the prediction;"</Q> which in effect is &s;aying, that if a prediction happen to prove ture, it is a real prophecy; if otherwi&s;e, that it is an idle tale. There have been prophecies not altogether &s;o well guarded as the Sybilline oracles. Napier, inventor of the logarithms, found the day of judgment predicted in the Revelation; and named the very day; which unfortunately he &s;urvived. He made another prediction, but prudently named a day &s;o di&s;|tant, as to be in no hazard of blu&s;hing a &s;econd time. Michel Stifels, a German clergyman, &s;pent mo&s;t of his life in attempting to di&s;cover the day of judgment; and at la&s;t announced to his pari&s;hioners, that it would happen within a year. The pari&s;hioners, re&s;olving to make the be&s;t of a bad bargain, &s;pent their time merrily, taking no care to lay up provi&s;ions for another year; and &s;o nice was their calculation, as at the end of the year to have not a mor&s;el remain|ing, either of food or of indu&s;try. The famous Jurieu has &s;hewn great ingenuity in explaining prophecies; of which take the following in|&s;tance. In his book, intitled, <HI>Accompli&s;hment of the prophecies,</HI> he demon&s;trates, that the bea&s;t in the Apocalyp&s;e, which held the <HI>poculum aureum plenum abominationum</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"The golden cup full of abominations."</Q></NOTE>, is the Pope; and his rea&s;on is, that the initial letters of the&s;e four Latin words compo&s;e the word <HI>papa;</HI> a very &s;ingular prophecy indeed; that is a prophecy in Latin, but in no other language. The candid reader will advert, that &s;uch prophecies as relate
<PB N="170" REF="180">
to our Saviour, and tend to a&s;certain the truth of his mi&s;&s;ion, fall not under the foregoing rea&s;on|ing; for they do not anticipate futurity, by producing foreknowledge of future events. They were not under&s;tood till our Saviour ap|peared among men; and then they were clearly under&s;tood as relative to him.</P>
<P>There is no end of &s;uper&s;tition in its various modes. It was believed univer&s;ally in dark times, that by certain forms and invocations, the &s;pirits of the dead could be called upon to reveal future events. A lottery in Florence, gainful to the go|vernment, and ruinous to the people, gives great &s;cope to &s;uper&s;tition. The purcha&s;er of tickets, in order to be &s;ucce&s;sful, mu&s;t fa&s;t &s;ix and thirty hours, mu&s;t repeat a certain number of Ave Ma|ries and Pater No&s;ters, mu&s;t not &s;peak to a living creature, mu&s;t not go to bed, mu&s;t continue in prayer to the Virgin, and to &s;aints, till &s;ome pro|pitious &s;aint appear and declare the numbers that are to be &s;ucce&s;sful. The ticket-holder, fa|tigued with fa&s;ting, praying, and expectation, falls a&s;leep. Occupied with the thoughts he had when awake, he dreams that a &s;aint appears, and mentions the numbers that are to be &s;ucce&s;s|ful. If he be di&s;appointed, he is vexed at his want of memory; but tru&s;ts in the &s;aint as an infallible oracle. Again he buys tickets, again falls a&s;leep, again &s;ees a vi&s;ion, and again is di&s;|appointed.</P>
<P>Lucky and unlucky days, which were &s;o much relied on as even to be marked in the Greek and Roman calendars, make an appendix to prophe|cies. The Tartars never undertake any thing of moment on a Wedne&s;day, being held by them unlucky. The Nogayan Tartars hold every thir|teenth year to be unlucky: they will not even wear a &s;word that year, believing that it would
<PB N="177" REF="181">
be their death; and they maintain, that none of their warriors ever returned who went upon an expedition in one of the&s;e years. They pa&s;s that time in fa&s;ting and prayer, and during it ne|ver marry. The inhabitants of Madaga&s;car have days fortunate and unfortunate with re&s;pect to the birth of children: they de&s;troy without mer|cy every child that is born on an unfortunate day.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e this important article with a reflection that ought to make an impre&s;&s;ion upon every ra|tional mind. The knowledge of future events, as far as it tends to influence our conduct, is in|con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of trial, &s;uch as Providence has allotted to man in this life. It would deprive him of hopes and fears, and leave him nothing to deliberate upon, nor any end to pro&s;ecute. In a word, it would put an end to his activity, and reduce him to be merely a pa&s;&s;ive being. Provi|dence therefore has wi&s;ely drawn a veil over fu|ture events, affording us no light for prying into them but &s;agacity and experience.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a few of the numberle&s;s ab&s;urd opi|nions about the conduct of Providence, that have prevailed among Chri&s;tians, and &s;till prevail a|mong &s;ome of them. Many opinions no le&s;s ab|&s;urd have prevailed about &s;peculative points. I confine my&s;elf to one or two in&s;tances; for to make a complete li&s;t would require a volume. The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention, and the mo&s;t noted, is tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; which though it has not the lea&s;t influence on practice, is reckoned &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial to &s;alvation, as to be placed above every mo|ral duty. The following text is appealed to as the &s;ole foundation of that article of faith. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And as they were eating, Je&s;us took bread, and ble&s;&s;ed it, and brake it, and gave it to the di&s;ciples, and &s;aid, Take, eat; this is my bo|dy.

At the &s;ame time, it is not &s;o much as in|&s;inuated, that there was here any miraculous tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation of the bread and wine into the bo|dy and blood of our Saviour; nor is it in&s;inua|ted, that the apo&s;tles believed they were eating the &s;le&s;h of their ma&s;ter, and drinking his blood. St. John, the favourite apo&s;tle, mentions not a word of this ceremony, which he certainly would not have omitted, had he imagined it an e&s;&s;ential article of faith.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing tran&s;ub&s;tantiation to be more clearly expre&s;&s;ed in this text, than it really is; yet men of good under&s;tanding will be loth to ad|mit a meaning that contradicts their five &s;en&s;es. They will reflect, that no man now living ever &s;aw the original books of the new te&s;tament; nor are they certain, that the editions we have, are copied directly from the originals. Every remove from them is liable to errors, which may ju&s;tly create a &s;u&s;picion of every text that contradicts rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e. Add, that the bulk of Chri&s;tians have not even a copy from the ori|ginal
<PB N="179" REF="183">
to build their faith upon, but only a tran|&s;lation into another language.</P>
<P>And this leads to what chiefly determined me to &s;elect that in&s;tance. God and nature have be|&s;towed upon us the faculty of rea&s;oning, for di|&s;tingui&s;hing truth from fa&s;ehood. If by rea&s;on|ing with candor and impartiality, we di&s;cover a propo&s;ition to be true or fal&s;e, it is not in our power to remain indifferent: we mu&s;t judge, and according to our judgment we mu&s;t pro|nounce. I &s;ay more, to pronounce is a duty we owe to our Maker; for to what purpo&s;e has he be&s;towed rea&s;on upon us, but in order to direct our belief? At the &s;ame time, we may depend on it as an intuitive truth, that God will never impo&s;e any belief on us, contradictory not only to our rea&s;on, but to our &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>The following objection however will perhaps reli&s;h more with people of plain under&s;tanding. Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation is a very extraordinary mi|racle, reiterated every day and in every corner of the earth, by prie&s;ts not always remarkable either for piety or for morality. Now I demand an an&s;wer to the following plain que&s;tion: To what good end or purpo&s;e is &s;uch a profu&s;ion of miracles &s;ub&s;ervient? I &s;ee none. But I di&s;co|ver a very bad one, if they have any influence; which is, that they accu&s;tom the Roman Catho|lics to more cruelty and barbarity, than even the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;avages are ever guilty of: &s;ome of them indeed devour the fle&s;h of their enemies; but none of them, the fle&s;h of their friends, e&s;peci|ally their greate&s;t friend. But to do ju&s;tice to people of that religion, I am confident, that this &s;uppo&s;ed miracle has no influence whatever upon their manners: to me it appears impo&s;&s;ible for any man &s;eriou&s;ly to believe, that the bread and wine u&s;ed at the Lord's &s;upper, is actually con|verted

into the body and blood of our Saviour. The Romi&s;h church requires the belief of tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation; and a zealous Catholic, out of pure obedience, <HI>thinks</HI> he believes it.

<HEAD>RELIGIOUS WORSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>IN the foregoing chapter are traced the gradual advances of the &s;en&s;e of Deity, from its im|perfect &s;tate among &s;avages to its maturity among
<PB N="186" REF="190">
enlightened nations, di&s;playing to us one great being to whom all other beings owe their exi&s;|tence, who made the world, and who governs it by the mo&s;t perfect laws. And our perception of Deity, ari&s;ing from that &s;en&s;e, is fortified by an intuitive propo&s;ition, that there nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t exi&s;t &s;ome being who had no beginning. Con&s;i|dering the Deity as the author of our exi&s;tence, we owe him gratitude; con&s;idering him as gover|nor of the world, we owe him obedience: and up|on the&s;e duties is founded the obligation we are under to wor&s;hip him. Further, God made man for &s;ociety, and implanted in his nature the mo|ral &s;en&s;e to direct his conduct in that &s;tate. From the&s;e premi&s;es, may it not with certainly be infer|red to be the will of God, that men &s;hould obey the dictates of the moral &s;en&s;e in fulfilling every duty of ju&s;tice and benevolence? The&s;e moral duties, it would appear, are our chief bu&s;ine&s;s in this life; being enforced not only by a moral but by a religious principle.</P>
<P>Morality, as laid down in a former &s;ketch, con|&s;i&s;ts of two great branches, viz. the moral &s;en&s;e, which unfolds our duty to man, and an active moral principle, which prompts us to perform that duty. Natural religion con&s;i&s;ts al&s;o of two great branches, viz. the &s;en&s;e of Deity, which unfolds our duty to our Maker, and the active principle of devotion, which prompts us to perform our duty to him. The univer&s;ality of the &s;en&s;e of Deity proves it to be innate: the &s;ame rea&s;on proves the principle of devotion to be innate; for all men agree in wor&s;hipping &s;uperior beings, whatever difference there may be in the mode of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Both branches of the duty we owe to God, that of wor&s;hipping him, and that of obeying his will with re&s;pect to our fellow-creatures, are
<PB N="187" REF="191">
&s;ummed up by the Prophet Micah in the following emphatic words. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He hath &s;hewed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju&s;tly, to love mer|cy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"</Q> The two articles fir&s;t mentioned, are moral duties re|garding our fellow-creatures; and as to &s;uch, what is required of us by the Lord is to do our duty to others, not only as directed by the moral &s;en&s;e, but as being the will of our Maker, to whom we owe ab&s;olute obedience. That branch of our duty is re&s;erved for a &s;econd &s;ection: at pre&s;ent we are to treat of religious wor&s;hip, included in the third article, viz. the walking humbly with our God.</P>

<HEAD>Religious Wor&s;hip.</HEAD>
<P>THE obligation we are under to wor&s;hip God, or to walk humbly with him, is, as ob&s;erved above, founded on the two great princi|ples of gratitude and obedience; both of them re|quiring fundamentally a pure heart, and a well|di&s;po&s;ed mind. But heart-wor&s;hip is alone not &s;ufficient: there are over and above required ex|ternal &s;igns, te&s;tifying to others the &s;en&s;e we have of the&s;e duties, and a firm re&s;olution to perform them. That &s;uch is the will of God, will appear as follows. The principle of devotion, like mo&s;t of our other principles, partakes of the imperfec|tion

of our nature: yet however faint originally, it is capable of being greatly invigorated by culti|vation and exerci&s;e. Private exerci&s;e is not &s;uf|ficient.

That it is required from us, as a te&s;timony to our Maker of our obedience to his laws: God, who knows the heart needs no &s;uch te&s;timony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arnobius <HI>(Adver&s;us gentes, lib.</HI> 1.) accounts ratio|nally for the wor&s;hip we pay to the Deity: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Huic omnes ex more pro&s;ternimur, hunc collatis precibus adoramus, ab hoc ju&s;ta, et hone&s;ta, et auditu ejus condigna, depo&s;cimus.

head, that lawgivers ought to avoid with caution the enforcing public wor&s;hip by rewards and pu|ni&s;hments: human laws cannot reach the heart, in which the e&s;&s;ence of wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ts: they may indeed bring on a li&s;tle&s;s habit of wor|&s;hip, by &s;eparating the external act from the internal affection, than which there can be nothing more hurtful to true religion. The utmo&s;t that can be &s;afely ventured, is to bring public wor&s;hip under cen&s;orian powers, as a matter of police, for pre&s;erving good order, and for preventing bad example.</P>
<P>The religion of Confucius, profe&s;&s;ed by the <HI>literati</HI> and per&s;ons of rank in China and Ton|quin, con&s;i&s;ts in a deep inward veneration for the God or King of heaven, and in the practice of every moral virtue. They have neither temples, nor prie&s;ts, nor any &s;ettled form of external wor|&s;hip: every one adores the &s;upreme Being in the manner he him&s;elf thinks be&s;t. This is indeed the mo&s;t refined &s;y&s;tem of religion that ever took place among men. There is however an invin|cible objection again&s;t it, which is, that it is not fitted for the human race: an excellent religi|gion it would be for angels; but is far too refin|ed, even for &s;ages and philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>Proceeding to deviations from the genuine wor|&s;hip required by our Maker, and gro&s;s deviations there have been, I begin with that &s;ort of wor|&s;hip which is influenced by fear, and which for that rea&s;on is univer&s;al among &s;avages. The A|merican
<PB N="190" REF="194">
&s;avages believe, that there are inferior deities without end, mo&s;t of them prone to mi&s;|chief: they neglect the &s;upreme Deity becau&s;e he is good; and direct their wor&s;hip to &s;oothe the malevolent inferior deities from doing harm. The inhabitants of the Molucca i&s;lands, who be|lieve the exi&s;tence of malevolent invi&s;ible beings &s;ubordinate to the &s;upreme benevolent Being, confine their wor&s;hip to the former, in order to avert their wrath; and one branch of their wor&s;hip is, to &s;et meat before them, hoping that when the belly is full, there will be le&s;s incli|nation to mi&s;chief. The wor&s;hip of the inhabi|tants of Java is much the &s;ame. The negroes of Benin wor&s;hip the devil, as Dapper expre&s;&s;es it, and &s;acrifice to him both men and bea&s;ts.

<P>The au&s;terities and penances that are practi&s;ed in almo&s;t all religions, &s;pring from the &s;ame root.

The &s;pirit of this &s;ect in&s;pires nothing but exce&s;&s;ive fear of the gods, who are painted prone to ven|geance, and always offended. The people of that religion pa&s;s mo&s;t of their time in torment|ing them&s;elves, to expiate imaginary faults; and they are treated by their prie&s;ts with de&s;poti&s;m and cruelty, that is not paralleled but by the in|qui&s;itors of Spain. The manners of the people are fierce, cruel, and unrelenting, &s;uch as never fail to be in&s;pired by horrible &s;uper&s;tition. The notion of invi&s;ible malevolent powers, formerly univer&s;al, is not to this hour eradicated, even among Chri&s;tians; for which I appeal to the fa&s;tings and flagellations among Roman-Catholics, held by them to be an e&s;&s;ential part of religion. People infected with religious horrors, are never &s;eriou&s;ly convinced, that an upright heart and &s;ound morality make the e&s;&s;ence of religion. The doctrine of the Jan&s;eni&s;ts, concerning re|pentance and mortification, &s;hows evidently, however they may deceive them&s;elves, that they have an impre&s;&s;ion of the Deity as a malevolent being. They hold the guilt contracted by Adam's fall to be a heinous &s;in, which ought to be expia|ted by acts of mortification, &s;uch as the torturing and macerating the body with painful labour, ex|ce&s;&s;ive ab&s;tinence, continual prayer and contem|plation. Their penances, whether for original or voluntary &s;in, are carried to extravagance; and they who put an end to their lives by &s;uch &s;everi|ties, are termed the &s;acred victims of repentance, con&s;umed by the fire of divine love. Such &s;ui|cides
<PB N="192" REF="196">
are e&s;teemed peculiarly meritorious in the eye of Heaven; and it is thought, that their &s;uf|ferings cannot fail to appea&s;e the anger of the Deity. That celibacy is a &s;tate of purity and perfection, is a prevailing notion in many coun|tries: among the Pagans, a married man was forbid to approach the altar, for &s;ome days after knowing his wife; and this ridiculous notion of pollution, contributed to introduce celibacy among the Roman-Catholic prie&s;ts. The Empe|ror Otho, <HI>anno</HI> 1218, became a &s;ignal penitent: but in&s;tead of atoning for his &s;ins by repentance and re&s;titution, he laid him&s;elf down to be trod under foot by the boys of his kitchen; and fre|quently &s;ubmitted to the di&s;cipline of the whip, inflicted by monks. The Emperor Charles V. toward the end of his days, was &s;orely depre&s;&s;ed in &s;pirit with fear of hell. Monks were his only companions, with whom he &s;pent his time in chanting hymns. As an expiation for his &s;ins, he in private di&s;ciplined him&s;elf with &s;uch &s;everi|ty, that his whip, found after his death, was tinged with his blood. Nor was he &s;atisfied with the&s;e acts of mortification: timorous and illiberal &s;olicitude &s;till haunting him, he aimed at &s;ome|thing extraordinary, at &s;ome new and &s;ingular act of piety, to di&s;play his zeal, and to merit the fa|vour of Heaven. The act he fixed on was as wild as any that &s;uper&s;tition ever &s;ugge&s;ted to a di&s;tempered brain: it was to celebrate his own ob&s;equies. He ordered his tomb to be erected in the chapel of the mona&s;tery: his dome&s;tics marched there in a funeral proce&s;&s;ion, holding black tapers: he followed in his &s;hroud: he was laid in his coffin with much &s;olemnity: the &s;er|vice of the dead was chanted; and he him|&s;elf joined in the prayers offered up for his <HI>requiem,</HI> mingling his tears with tho&s;e of his at|tendants.
<PB N="193" REF="197">
The ceremony clo&s;ed with &s;prinkling holy water upon the coffin; and the a&s;&s;i&s;tants re|retiring, the doors of the chapel were &s;hut. Then Charles ro&s;e out of the coffin, and &s;tole privately to his apartment.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of ancient &s;acrifices is not &s;o accu|rate, as in every in&s;tance to a&s;certain upon what principle they were founded, whether upon fear, upon gratitude for favours received, or to &s;olicit future favour. Human &s;acrifices undoubtedly belong to the pre&s;ent head: for being calculated to deprecate the wrath of a malevolent deity, they could have no other motive but fear; and indeed they are a mo&s;t direful effect of that pa&s;|&s;ion. It is needle&s;s to lo&s;e time in mentioning in|&s;tances, which are well known to tho&s;e who are acquainted with ancient hi&s;tory. A number of them are collected in Hi&s;torical Law-tracts<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Tract 1.</NOTE>: and to the&s;e I take the liberty of adding, that the Cimbrians, the Germans, the Gauls, particularly the Druids, practi&s;ed human &s;acrifices; for which we have the authority of Julius Cae&s;ar, Strabo, and other authors. A people upon the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, named <HI>Ten&s;as,</HI> wor&s;hip the &s;un; and, like the Natches their neighbours, have a temple for that luminary, with a &s;acred fire in it, conti|nually burning. The temple having been &s;et on fire by thunder, was all in flames, when &s;ome French travellers &s;aw them throw children into the fire, one after another, to appea&s;e the incen&s;ed deity. The Prophet Micah<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chap. 6.</NOTE>, in a pa&s;&s;age partly quoted above, inveighs bitterly again&s;t &s;uch &s;acrifices: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Wherewith &s;hall I come before
<PB N="194" REF="198">
the Lord, and bow my&s;elf before the high God? &s;hall I come before him with burnt|offerings, with calves of a year old? will the Lord be plea&s;ed with thou&s;ands of rams, or with ten thou&s;ands of rivers of oil? &s;hall I give my fir&s;t-born for my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the fruit of my body for the &s;in of my &s;oul? He hath &s;hewed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju&s;tly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"</Q></P>
<P>The ancient Per&s;ians acknowledged Oromazes and Arimanes as their great deities, authors of good and ill to men. But I find not that Ari|manes, the evil principle, was ever an object of any religious wor&s;hip. The Gaures, who pro|fe&s;s the ancient religion of Per&s;ia, addre&s;s no wor|&s;hip but to one God, all-good and all-powerful.</P>
<P>Next, of wor&s;hipping the Deity in the charac|ter of a mercenary being. Under that head come &s;acrifices and oblations, whether prompted by gratitude for favours received, or by &s;elf-intere&s;t to procure future favours; which, for the rea&s;on mentioned, I &s;hall not attempt to di&s;tingui&s;h. As the deities of early times were thought to re&s;em|ble men, it is not wonderful, that men endea|voured to conciliate their favour, with &s;uch offe|rings as were the mo&s;t acceptable to them&s;elves. It is probable, that the fir&s;t &s;acrifices of that kind were of &s;weet-&s;melling herbs, which in the fire emitted a flavour, that might reach the no&s;trils of a deity, even at a di&s;tance. The burning in|cen&s;e to their gods, was practi&s;ed in Mexico and Peru; and at pre&s;ent is practi&s;ed in the pe|nin&s;ula of Corea. An opportunity &s;o favourable for making religious zeal a fund of riches to the prie&s;thood, is &s;eldom neglected. There was no difficulty to per&s;uade ignorant people, that the
<PB N="195" REF="199">
gods could eat as well as &s;mell: what was offered to a deity for food, being carried into the temple was under&s;tood to be devoured by him.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Jewi&s;h &s;acrifices of burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, &s;in-offerings, peace-offerings, heave-offerings, and wave-offerings, the&s;e were appointed by God him&s;elf, in order to keep that &s;tiff-necked people in daily remem|brance of their dependence on him, and to pre|&s;erve them if po&s;&s;ible from idolatry. But that untractable race did not adhere to the purity of the in&s;titution: they in&s;en&s;ibly degenerated into the notion that their God was a mercenary being; and in that character only, was the wor&s;hip of &s;acrifices performed to him: the offerings menti|oned were liberally be&s;towed on him, not &s;ingly as a token of their dependence, but chiefly in order to avert his wrath, or to gain his favour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is no mention in ancient authors of fi&s;h be|ing offered to the gods in &s;acrifice. The rea&s;on I take to be, that the mo&s;t &s;avoury food of man was reckon|ed the mo&s;t agreeable to their gods; that &s;avages never thought of fi&s;h till land-animals became &s;carce; and that the matter as well as form of &s;acrifices were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in practice, long before men had recour&s;e to fi&s;h for food.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The religious notions of the Greeks were equally impure: they could not think of any means for conciliating the favour of their gods, more efficacious than gifts. Homer paints his gods as mercenary to an extreme. In the fourth book of the Iliad, Jupiter &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Of the&s;e cities, honoured the mo&s;t by the &s;oul of Jove, is &s;a|cred Troy. Never &s;tands the altar empty be|fore me, oblations poured forth in my pre|&s;ence, &s;avour that a&s;cends the &s;kies."</Q> Speak|ing
<PB N="196" REF="200">
in the fifth book of a warrior, known after|ward to be Diomedes, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Some god he is, &s;ome power again&s;t the Trojans enraged for vows unpaid: de&s;tructive is the wrath of the gods."</Q> Diomedes prays to Minerva, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"With thine arm ward from me the foe: a year old heifer, O Queen, &s;hall be thine, broad-fronted, unbro|ken, and wild: her to thee I will offer with prayer, gilding with gold her horns."</Q> Pre|ci&s;ely of the &s;ame kind, are the offerings made by &s;uper&s;titious Roman Catholics to the Virgin Mary, and to &s;aints. Electra, in the tragedy of that name, &s;upplicates Apollo in the following terms.<Q><L>&mdash;O! hear Electra too;</L>
<L>Who, with un&s;paring hand, her chice&s;t gifts</L>
<L>Hath never fail'd to lay before thy altars;</L>
<L>Accept the little All that now remains</L>
<L>For me to give.</L></Q></P>
<P>The people of Hindo&s;tan, as mentioned above, atone for their &s;ins by au&s;tere penances; but they have no notion of pre&s;enting gifts to the Deity, nor of deprecating his wrath with the blood of animals. On the contrary, they reckon it a &s;in to &s;lay any living creature; which reduces them to vegetable food. This is going too far; for the Deity could never mean to prohibit animal food, when man's chief dependence originally was upon it. The ab&s;taining, however, from animal food, &s;hows greater humanity in the religion of Hindo&s;tan, than of any other known country. The inhabitants of Madaga&s;car are in a &s;tage of religion, common among many nations, which is, the acknowledging one &s;upreme benevolent Deity, and many malevolent inferior deities. Mo&s;t of their wor&s;hip is indeed addre&s;&s;ed to the
<PB N="197" REF="201">
latter; but they have &s;o far advanced before &s;e|veral other nations, as to offer &s;acrifices to the &s;upreme Being, without employing either idols or temples.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy and &s;ound &s;en&s;e, in poli&s;hed nati|tions, have purified religious wor&s;hip, by bani&s;h|ing the profe&s;&s;ion at lea&s;t of oblations and &s;acrifi|ces. The Being that made the world, governs it by laws that are inflexible, becau&s;e they are the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible; and to imagine that he can be mo|ved by prayers, oblations, or &s;acrifices, to vary his plan of government, is an impious thought, degrading the Deity to a level with our&s;elves: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hear, O my people, and I will te&s;tify again&s;t thee: I am God, even thy God.

This is a proper place for the hi&s;tory of idola|try; which, as will anon appear, &s;prung from religious wor&s;hip, corrupted by men of &s;hallow under&s;tanding and gro&s;s conceptions, upon whom things invi&s;ible make little impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Savages, even of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s, have an impre&s;&s;ion of invi&s;ible powers, though they can|not form any di&s;tinct notion of them.

Tradition points out many &s;tones in different parts of the world, that were u&s;ed in religious wor&s;hip. A large &s;tone wor&s;hip|ped by the Pe&s;&s;enuntians, a people of Phrygia, under the name of <HI>Idaea mater,</HI> was, upon a &s;o|lemn emba&s;&s;y to that people, brought to Rome; it being contained in the Sybilline books, that un|le&s;s the Romans got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that godde&s;s, they never would prevail over Hannibal. And Pau&s;anias mentions many &s;tones in Greece, dedi|cated to different divinities; particularly thirty &s;quare &s;tones in Achaia, on which were engraved the names of as many gods. In another place, he mentions a very ancient &s;tatue of Venus in the i&s;land Delos, which, in&s;tead of feet, had only a &s;quare &s;tone. This may appear a puzzling cir|cum&s;tance in the hi&s;tory of Greece, con&s;idering that all the Grecian gods were originally mortals,
<PB N="201" REF="205">
whom it was ea&s;y to repre&s;ent by &s;tatues: but in that early period, the Greeks knew no more of &s;tatuary than the mo&s;t barbarous nations. It is perhaps not ea&s;y to gather the meaning of &s;a|vages, with re&s;pect to &s;uch &s;tones: the mo&s;t na|tural conjecture is, that a great &s;tone, dedicated to the wor&s;hip of a certain deity, was con&s;idered as belonging to him. This notion of property had a double effect: the wor&s;hippers, by con|nection of ideas, were led from the &s;tone to the deity: and the &s;tone tended to fix their wander|ing thoughts. It was probably imagined, over and above, that &s;ome latent virtue communicated to the &s;tone, made it holy or &s;acred. Even a|mong enlightened people, a &s;ort of virtue or &s;anctity is conceived to re&s;ide in the place of wor&s;hip: why not al&s;o in a &s;tone dedicated to a deity? The ancient Ethiopians, in their wor|&s;hip, introduced the figure of a &s;erpent as a &s;ym|bol of the deity: two &s;ticks laid cro&s;s repre&s;ent|ed Ca&s;tor and Pollux, Roman divinities: a jave|lin repre&s;ented their god Mars; and in Tartary, formerly, the god of war was wor&s;hipped under the &s;ymbol of an old ru&s;ty &s;abre. The ancient Per&s;ians u&s;ed con&s;ecrated fire, as an emblem of the great God. Though the negroes of Congo and Angola have images without number, they are not however idolaters in any proper &s;en&s;e: their belief is, that the&s;e images are only organs by which the deities &s;ignify their will to their vo|taries.</P>
<P>If the u&s;e that was made of &s;tones and of other &s;ymbols in religious wor&s;hip, be fairly repre&s;ented, it may appear &s;trange, that the ingenious Greeks &s;unk down into idolatry, at the very time they were making a rapid progre&s;s in the fine arts. Their improvements in &s;tatuary, one of the&s;e arts, was the cau&s;e. They began with attempting to
<PB N="202" REF="206">
carve heads of men and women, repre&s;enting their deified heroes; which were placed upon the &s;tones dedicated to the&s;e divinities. In the progre&s;s of the art, &s;tatues were executed complete in every member; and at la&s;t, &s;tatues of the gods were made, expre&s;&s;ing &s;uch dignity and maje&s;ty, as in|&s;en&s;ibly to draw from beholders a degree of devo|tion to the &s;tatues them&s;elves. Hear Quintilian upon that &s;ubject. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"At quae Polycleto defue|runt, Phidiae atque Alcameni dantur.

Such &s;tatues as are repre&s;ented by Quintilian, &s;erve greatly to en|&s;lame devotion; and during a warm fit of the religious pa&s;&s;ion, the repre&s;entation is lo&s;t, and the &s;tatue becomes a deity; preci&s;ely as where King Lear is repre&s;ented by Garrick: the actor vani&s;hes; and, behold! the King him&s;elf. This is not &s;ingular. Anger occa&s;ions a metamorpho&s;is &s;till more extraordinary: if I happen to &s;trike my gouty toe again&s;t a &s;tone, the violence of the pain
<PB N="203" REF="207">
converts the &s;tone for a moment into a voluntary agent; and I wreak my re&s;entment on it, as if it really were &s;o. It is true, the image is only con|ceived to be a deity during the fervour of devoti|on; and when that &s;ub&s;ides, the image falls back to its original repre&s;entative &s;tate. But frequent in&s;tances of that kind, have at la&s;t the effect among illiterate people, to convert the image into a &s;ort of permanent deity: what &s;uch people &s;ee, makes a deep impre&s;&s;ion; what they &s;ee not, little or none at all. There is another thing that concurs with eye-&s;ight, to promote this delu&s;ion: devotion, being a vigorous principle in the human brea&s;t, will exert it&s;elf upon the meane&s;t object, when none more noble is in view.</P>
<P>The ancient Per&s;ians held the con&s;ecrated fire to be an emblem only of the great God: but &s;uch veneration was paid to that emblem, and with &s;o great ceremony was it treated, that the vulgar came at la&s;t to wor&s;hip it as a &s;ort of deity. The prie&s;ts of the Gaures watch the con&s;ecrated fire day and night: they keep it alive with the pure&s;t wood, without bark: they touch it not with &s;word nor knife: they blow it not with bellows, nor with the mouth: even the prie&s;t is prohi|bited to approach it, till his mouth be covered with fine linen, le&s;t it be polluted with his breath: if it happen to go out, it mu&s;t be re|kindled by &s;triking fire from flint, or by a burning gla&s;s.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of idolatry will more clearly ap|pear, from attending to the religion of the Greeks and Romans. The Greeks, as mentioned above, made u&s;e of &s;tones in divine wor&s;hip, long before idolatry was introduced: and we learn from Var|ro, that for a hundred and &s;eventy years after Numa, the Romans had no &s;tatues nor images in their temples. After &s;tatues of the gods came

in fa&s;hion, they acquired by degrees more and more re&s;pect. The Greek and Roman writers, talk of divine virtue being communicated to &s;ta|tues; and &s;ome of the Roman writers talk famili|arly, of the <HI>numen</HI> of a deity re&s;iding in his &s;tatue. Arnobius, in his book again&s;t the Gentiles, intro|duces a Gentile delivering the following opinion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We do not believe, that the metal which com|po&s;es a &s;tatue, whether gold, or &s;ilver, or bra&s;s, is a god, But we believe, that a &s;o|lemn dedication brings down the god to inha|bit his image; and it is the god only that we wor&s;hip in that image."</Q> This explains the Roman ceremony, of inviting to their &s;ide the tutelar deities of towns be&s;ieged by them, termed <HI>evacatio tutelarium deorum:</HI> the Romans, cruel as they were, overflowed with &s;uper&s;tition; and as they were aver&s;e from combating the tutelar dei|ties even of their enemies, they endeavoured to gain the&s;e deities by large promi&s;es, and a&s;&s;urance of honourable treatment. As they could not hope that a &s;tatue would change its place, their notion mu&s;t have been, that by this ceremony, the tute|lar deity might be prevailed upon to withdraw its <HI>numen,</HI> and leave the &s;tatue a dead lump of matter. When Stilpo was bani&s;hed by the Areopagus of Athens for affirming, that the &s;tatue in the tem|ple of Minerva was not the godde&s;s, but a piece of matter carved by Phidias; he &s;urely was not condemned for &s;aying, that the &s;tatue was made by Phidias, a fact univer&s;ally known: his here&s;y con&s;i&s;ted in denying that the <HI>numen</HI> of Minerva re|&s;ided in the &s;tatue. Augu&s;tus, having twice lo&s;t his fleet by &s;torm, forbade Neptune to be carried in proce&s;&s;ion along with the other gods; ima|gining he had avenged him&s;elf of Neptune, by neglecting the favourite &s;tatue in which his <HI>numen</HI> re&s;ided.</P>

When &s;aints in the Chri&s;tian church were dei|fied, even their images became objects of wor|&s;hip; from a fond imagination, that &s;uch wor|&s;hip draws down into the images, the &s;ouls of the &s;aints they repre&s;ent: which is the &s;ame doctrine that Arnobius, in the pa&s;&s;age above mentioned, a&s;cribes to the Gentiles; and is not widely diffe|rent from the belief of the Pagan Tartars and O&s;tiacs, by and by to be mentioned. In the ele|venth century, there was a violent di&s;pute about images in the Greek church; many a&s;&s;erting, that in the images of our Saviour and of the &s;aints, there re&s;ides an inherent &s;anctity, which is a pro|per object of wor&s;hip; and that Chri&s;tians ought not to confine their wor&s;hip to the per&s;ons re|pre&s;ented, but ought al&s;o to extend it to their images.</P>
<P>As ignorant and &s;avage nations can form no conception of Deity, but of a being like a man, only &s;uperior in power and greatne&s;s, images are made of the Deity in &s;everal nations conformable to this conception. It is ea&s;y to make &s;ome re|&s;emblance of a man; but how is power and greatne&s;s to be repre&s;ented? To perform this with propriety, would require a Hogarth. Savages go more bluntly to work: they endeavour to re|pre&s;ent a man with many heads, and with a &s;till greater number of hands. The northern Tartars &s;eem to have no deities but certain &s;tatues or ima|ges coar&s;ely formed out of wood, and bearing &s;ome di&s;tant re&s;emblance to the human figure. To palliate &s;o gro&s;s an ab&s;urdity, as that a god can be fabricated by the hands of man, they ima|gine this image to be endued with a &s;oul: to &s;ay whence that &s;oul came, would puzzle the wi&s;e&s;t of them. That &s;oul is conceived to be too ele|vated for dwelling con&s;tantly in a piece of matter: they believe that it re&s;ides in &s;ome more honou|rable

place; and that it only vi&s;its the image or idol, when it is called down by prayers and &s;up|plications. They &s;acrifice to this idol, by rub|bing its mouth with the fat of fi&s;h, and by offer|ing it the warm blood of &s;ome bea&s;t killed in hunting. The la&s;t &s;tep of the ceremony is, to honour the &s;oul of the idol with a joyful &s;hout, as a &s;ort of convoy to it when it returns home. The O&s;tiacs have a wooden idol, termed, <HI>The Old Man of Oby,</HI> who is guardian of their fi&s;hery: it hath eyes of gla&s;s, and a head with &s;hort horns. When the ice di&s;&s;olves, they crowd to this idol, reque&s;ting that he will be propitious to their fi|&s;hery. If un&s;ucce&s;sful, he is loaded with re|proaches: if &s;ucce&s;sful, he is entitled to a &s;hare of the capture. They make a fea&s;t for him, rubbing his &s;nout with choice fat; and, when the entertainment is over, they accompany the &s;oul of the idol a little way, beating the air with their cudgels. The O&s;tiacs have another idol, that is fed with milk &s;o abundantly, as to come out on both &s;ides of the &s;poon, and to fall down upon the ve&s;ture; which, however, is never wa&s;hed, &s;o little is cleanline&s;s thought e&s;&s;ential to religion by that people. It is indeed wonderfully ab&s;urd, to think, that invi&s;ible &s;ouls require food like hu|man creatures; and yet the &s;ame ab&s;urdity pre|vailed in Greece.</P>
<P>The ancient Germans, a &s;ober and &s;en&s;ible people, had no notion of repre&s;enting their gods by &s;tatues, nor of building temples to them. They wor&s;hipped in con&s;ecrated groves<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Tacitus de moribus Germanorum, cap. 9.</NOTE>. The Egyptians, from a ju&s;t conception that an invi&s;i|ble being can have no re&s;emblance to one that is
<PB N="207" REF="211">
vi&s;ible, employed hieroglyphical figures for de|noting metaphorically the attributes of their gods; and they employed, not only the figures of birds and bea&s;ts, but of vegetables; leeks, for example, and onions. This metaphorical adjunct to religi|on, innocent in it&s;elf, &s;unk the Egyptians to the lowe&s;t degree of idolatry. As hieroglyphical fi|gures, compo&s;ed frequently of heterogeneous parts, re&s;emble not any being human or devine; the vulgar, lo&s;ing &s;ight of the emblematic &s;ignifi|cation, which is not readily under&s;tood but by poets and philo&s;ophers, took up with the plain fi|gures as real divinities. How otherwi&s;e can it be accounted for, that the ox, the ape, the onion, were in Egypt wor&s;hipped as deities? But this mu&s;t be under&s;tood of the vulgar only. It is &s;carce &s;uppo&s;able, that the better &s;ort of people could think &s;o gro&s;sly; and we have the authority of Plutarch for doubting. In his chapter upon I&s;is and O&s;iris, he ob&s;erves, that the Egyptians wor&s;hipped the bull, the cat, and other animals; not as divinities, but as repre&s;entatives of them, like an image &s;een in a gla&s;s; or, as he expre&s;&s;es it in another part of the &s;ame chapter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ju&s;t as we &s;ee the re&s;emblance of the &s;un in a drop of water."</Q> However this be, the Egyptian wor|&s;hip is an illu&s;trious in&s;tance of the influence of devotion: how powerful mu&s;t it be in its purity, when even in a wrong direction, it can force its way again&s;t every ob&s;tacle of common &s;en&s;e! And &s;uch re&s;pect was paid to the&s;e animals, if we can tru&s;t Diodorus Siculus, that in a great famine, the Egyptians ventured not to touch the &s;acred ani|mals, though they were forced to devour one an|other. The veneration paid to a cow in Hindo&s;tan aro&s;e probably from the &s;ame cau&s;e, viz. its hav|ing been u&s;ed as a &s;ymbol of the Deity. A &s;nake of a particular kind, about a yard long, and about

the thickne&s;s of a man's arm, is wor&s;hipped by the Whidans in Guinea. It has a large round head, piercing eyes, a &s;hort pointed tongue, and a &s;mooth &s;kin, beautifully &s;peckled. It has a &s;trong antipathy to all the venomous kind; in other re|&s;pects, innocent and tame. To kill them being a capital crime, they travel about unmole&s;ted, even into bedchambers. They occa&s;ioned, ann. 1697, a ridiculous per&s;ecution. A hog, tea&s;ed by one of them, gna&s;hed it with his tu&s;ks till it died. The prie&s;ts carried their complaint to the king; and no one pre&s;uming to appear as coun&s;el for the hogs, orders were i&s;&s;ued for &s;laughtering the whole race. At once were brandi&s;hed a thou&s;and cutla&s;&s;es; and the race would have been extirpated, had not the king interpo&s;ed, repre&s;enting to the prie&s;ts, that they ought to re&s;t &s;atisfied with the innocent blood they had &s;pilt. Rancour and cruelty never rage more violently, than under the ma&s;k of reli|gion.</P>
<P>It is amazing how prone the mo&s;t poli&s;hed na|tions formerly were to idolatry. The Tyrians, be&s;ieged by Alexander, chained down Hercules, their tutelar deity, to prevent him from de&s;erting to the enemy; which is &s;aid to have been al&s;o practi&s;ed in Sparta. The city of Ambracia being taken by the Romans, and every &s;tatue of their gods being carried to Rome; the Ambracians complained bitterly, that not a &s;ingle divinity was left them to wor&s;hip. How much more rational are the Hindo&s;tan bramins, who teach their di&s;|ciples, that idols are emblems only of the Deity, intended merely to fix the attention of the po|pulace!</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tatues in Greece and Tu&s;cany, were made with wings, to &s;ignify the &s;wift motion of the gods. The&s;e &s;tatues were &s;o clum&s;y, as
<PB N="209" REF="213">
&s;carce to re&s;emble human creatures, not to talk of a divinity. But the admirable &s;tatues exe|cuted in later times, were imagined to re&s;emble mo&s;t accurately the deities repre&s;ented by them: whence the vulgar notion, that gods have wings, and that angels have wings.</P>
<P>I proceed to what in the hi&s;tory of idolatry may be reckoned the &s;econd part. Statues, we have &s;een, were at fir&s;t u&s;ed as repre&s;entatives only of the Deity; but came afterward to be metamorpho&s;ed into divinities. The ab&s;urdity did not &s;top there. People, not &s;atisfied with the vi&s;ible deities erected in temples for public wor&s;hip, became fond to have private de|ities of their own, whom they wor&s;hipped as their tutelar deities; and this practice &s;pread &s;o wide, as that among many nations every family had hou&s;ehold gods cut in wood or &s;tone. Eve|ry family in Kam&s;katka has a tutelar deity in the &s;hape of a pillar, with the head of a man, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to guard the hou&s;e again&s;t malevolent &s;pirits. They give it food daily, and anoint the head with the fat of fi&s;h. The Prophet I&s;aiah<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chap. 44.</NOTE> put this &s;pecies of deification in a mo&s;t ridi|culous light: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He burneth part thereof in the fire: with part thereof he roa&s;teth fle&s;h: of the re&s;idue he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down, wor&s;hipping, and praying to it, and &s;aith, Deliver me, for thou art my god."</Q> Multiplication could not fail to &s;ink hou&s;ehold-gods into a degree of contempt: expectation of good from them, might produce &s;ome cold ceremonial wor&s;hip; but there could be no real devotion at heart. The Chine&s;e man|ner of treating their hou&s;ehold-gods, will vouch
<PB N="210" REF="214">
for me. When a Chine&s;e does not obtain what he prays for, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thou &s;piritual dog,"</Q> he will &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I lodge thee well, thou art beaufully gild|ed, treated with perfumes and burnt-offer|ings; and yet thou with-holde&s;t from me the nece&s;&s;aries of life."</Q> Sometimes they fa&s;ten a cord to the idol, and drag it through the dirt. The inhabitants of Ceylon treat their idols in the &s;ame manner. Thor, Woden, and Friga, were the great deities of the Scandinavians. They had at the &s;ame time inferior deities, who were &s;up|po&s;ed to have been men tran&s;lated into heaven for their good works. The&s;e they treated with very little ceremony, refu&s;ing to wor&s;hip them if they were not propitious; and even puni&s;hing them with bani&s;hment; but re&s;toring them after a time, in hopes of amendment. Dome&s;tic idols are treated by the O&s;tiacs not more reverently than by the people mentioned. But they have public idols, &s;ome particularly of bra&s;s, which are high|ly reverenced: the &s;olidity of the metal is in their imagination connected with immortality; and great regard is paid to the&s;e idols, for the knowledge and experience they mu&s;t have ac|quired in an endle&s;s cour&s;e of time.</P>
<P>Saints, or tutelar deities, are &s;ometimes not better treated among Roman Catholics, than among Pagans. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When we were in Portugal,"</Q> &s;ays Captain Brydone, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the people of Ca&s;tel|branco were &s;o enraged at St Antonio, for &s;uf|fering the Spaniards to plunder their town, contrary, as they affirmed, to his expre&s;s agreement with them, that they broke many of his &s;tatues to pieces; and one that had been more revered than the re&s;t, they took the head off, and in its &s;tead placed one of St Francis. The great St Januarius him&s;elf was in immi|nent danger, during the la&s;t famine at Naples.

The peo|ple &s;ay, that they had given her ju&s;t provocation; but that &s;he has long ago been reconciled to them, and has promi&s;ed never to &s;uffer the lava to hurt them again. At the foot of Mount Etna, a &s;ta|tue of a &s;aint is placed as a memorial, for having prevented the lava from running up the mountain of Taurominum, and de&s;troying that town; the &s;aint having conducted the lava down a low val|ley to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>When a traveller once happens to deviate from the right road, there is no end of wandering. Porphyrius reports, that in Anubis, an Egyptian city, a real man was wor&s;hipped as a god; which is al&s;o a&s;&s;erted by Minucius Foelix, in his apolo|gy for the Chri&s;tians. A thou&s;and writers have &s;aid, that the Tartars believe their high-prie&s;t, termed <HI>Dalai Lama,</HI> to be immortal. But that is a mi&s;take: his death is publi&s;hed through the whole country; and couriers, &s;ent even to Pekin, intimate it to the Emperor of China: his effigy, at the &s;ame time, is taken down from the portal of the great church, and that of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or is put in its &s;tead. The &s;y&s;tem of the metemp&s;y|cho&s;is, adopted in that country, has occa&s;ioned the mi&s;take. They believe, that the holy &s;pirit, which animates a Dalai Lama, pa&s;&s;es upon his death into the body of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The &s;pirit therefore is believed to be immortal, not the bo|dy. The Dalai Lama, however, is the object of profound veneration. The Tartar princes are
<PB N="212" REF="216">
daily &s;ending pre&s;ents to him, and con&s;ulting him as an oracle: they even undertake a pilgrimage in order to wor&s;hip him in per&s;on. In a retired part of the temple, he is &s;hown covered with precious &s;tones, and &s;itting cro&s;s-legged. They pro&s;trate them&s;elves before him at a di&s;tance, for they are not permitted to ki&s;s his toe. The prie&s;ts make traffic even of his excrements, which are greedily purcha&s;ed at a high price, and are kept in a golden box hanging from the neck, as a charm again&s;t every misfortune. Like the cro&s;s of Je&s;us, or the Virgin's milk, we may believe, there never will be wanting plenty of that preci|ous &s;tuff to an&s;wer all demands: the prie&s;ts out of charity will furni&s;h a quota, rather than &s;uffer votaries to depart with their money for want of goods to purcha&s;e. The per&s;on of the Japan Pope, or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Emperor, is held &s;o &s;a|cred, as to make the cutting his beard, or his nails, a deadly &s;in. But ab&s;urd laws are never &s;teadily executed. The beard and the nails are cut in the night-time, when the Pope is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;leeping; and what is taken away by that operation, is under&s;tood to be &s;tolen from him, which is no impeachment upon his Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>That the Jews were idolaters when they &s;o|journed in the land of Go&s;hen, were it not pre|&s;umable from their commerce with the Egypti|ans, would however be evident from the hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es. Notwith&s;tanding their miraculous deliverance from the Egyptian king, notwith|&s;tanding the daily miracles wrought among them in the wilderne&s;s; &s;o addicted were they to a vi&s;ible deity, that, during even the momentary ab&s;ence of Mo&s;es conver&s;ing with God on the mount, they fabricated a golden calf, and wor&s;hipped it as their god. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And the Lord &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, Go, get thee down: for thy people which

What profu&s;i|on of blood, to bring that ob&s;tinate and perver&s;e people to the true religion! all in vain. The book of Judges, in particular, is full of reitera|ted relap&s;es, from their own invi&s;ible God, to the vi&s;ible gods of other nations. And in all pro|bability, their anxious de&s;ire for a vi&s;ible king, related in the fir&s;t book of Samuel, aro&s;e from their being deprived of a vi&s;ible god. There was a nece&s;&s;ity for prohibiting images<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Deuteronomy, xvi. 22.</NOTE>; which would have &s;oon been converted into deities vi&s;i|ble: and it was extremely prudent, to &s;upply the want of a vi&s;ible god, with endle&s;s &s;hews and ce|remonies; which accordingly became the capital branch of the Jewi&s;h wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>It appears to me from the whole hi&s;tory of the Jews, that a gro&s;s people are not &s;u&s;ceptible but of a gro&s;s religion; and without an enlightened un|der&s;tanding, that it is vain to think of eradicating &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry. And after all the co|venants made with the Jews, after all the cha&s;|ti&s;ements and all the miracles lavi&s;hed on them, that they were not however reclaimed from the
<PB N="214" REF="218">
mo&s;t groveling idolatry, is evident from the two golden calves fabricated by Jeroboam, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Behold thy gods, O I&s;rael, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, xii. 28.</NOTE>."</Q> The people al&s;o of Judah fell back to idol-wor&s;hip un|der Rehoboam, &s;on of Solomon<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, xiv. 23.</NOTE>.

Down to the days of King Hezekiah, the Jews wor&s;hipped the brazen &s;erpent erected by Mo&s;es in the wilderne&s;s. The Jews &s;eem in|deed to have been a very perver&s;e people: the many promi&s;es and threatenings announced by their prophets, and the many miracles wrought among them, had no permanent effect to re&s;train them from idolatry; and yet, during their cap|tivity in Babylon, &s;everal of them &s;ubmitted to be burnt alive, rather than to join in idol wor|&s;hip<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Daniel, chap. 3.</NOTE>. Captivity cured them radically of ido|latry; and from that period to this day, they have not been guilty of a &s;ingle relap&s;e.

manner of living, they acknowledge none of the common deities: they acknowledge but one, whom they wor&s;hip with great venerati|on. There never was an image in Jeru&s;alem; becau&s;e they believe their God to be invi&s;ible and ineffable. They have built him a temple of great &s;ize and beauty, remarkable in the following particular, that it is open above, without any roof."</Q></P>
<P>There lies no &s;olid objection again&s;t images among an enlightened people, when u&s;ed merely to rou&s;e devotion. But as images tend to per|vert the vulgar, they ought not to be admitted into churches: pictures are le&s;s liable to be mi&s;|apprehended; and the Ethiopians accordingly in|dulge pictures, though they prohibit &s;tatues, in their churches. The general council of Frank|fort permitted the u&s;e of images in churches; but &s;trictly prohibited any wor&s;hip to be addre&s;|&s;ed to them. So prone however to idolatry are the low and illiterate, that the prohibition lo&s;t ground both in France and in Germany; and idol-wor&s;hip became again general.</P>
<P>It is extremely probable, that the &s;un and moon were early held to be deities, and that they were the fir&s;t vi&s;ible objects of wor&s;hip. It mu&s;t indeed be acknowledged, that of all the different kinds of idolatry, it is the mo&s;t excu&s;able. Up|on the &s;un depends health, vigour, and cheerful|ne&s;s: during his retirement, all is dark and di&s;|con&s;olate: when he performs his maje&s;tic round, to ble&s;s his &s;ubjects, and to be&s;tow fecundity up|on every animal and vegetable, can a mere &s;a|vage with-hold gratitude and veneration!

&s;un a &s;hare of their meat and drink. The inha|bitants of Darien believe in the &s;un as their god, and in the moon as his wife, paying equal adora|tion to each. The people of Borneo wor&s;hip the &s;un and moon as real divinities. The Samo|ides wor&s;hip both, bowing to them morning and evening in the Per&s;ian manner.</P>
<P>But if the &s;un and moon were the fir&s;t objects of idolatry, knowledge and reflection reformed many from the error of holding the&s;e luminaries to be deities. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That original intelligence,"</Q> &s;ay the Magians, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"who is the fir&s;t principle of all things, di&s;covers him&s;elf to the mind and under&s;tanding only: but he hath placed the &s;un as his image in the vi&s;ible univer&s;e; and the beams of that bright luminary, are but a faint copy of the glory that &s;hines in the high|er heavens."</Q> The Per&s;ians, as Herodotus reports, had neither temples, nor altars, nor images: for, &s;ays that author, they do not think, like the Greeks, that there is any re&s;em|blance between gods and men. The Gaures, who to this day profe&s;s the ancient religion of Per&s;ia, celebrate divine wor&s;hip before the &s;a|cred fire, and turn with peculiar veneration to|ward the ri&s;ing &s;un, as the repre&s;entative of God; but they adore neither the &s;un, nor the &s;acred fire. They are profe&s;&s;ed enemies to every image of the Deity cut with hands: and hence the ha|vock made by the ancient Per&s;ians, upon the &s;ta|tues and temples of The Grecian gods. Such &s;ublimity of thought was above the reach of other unin&s;pired nations, excepting only the Hin|dows and Chine&s;e.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e the hi&s;tory of idolatry with a brief re|capitulation of the outlines. Admitting the &s;un and moon to have been the fir&s;t objects of idola|try, yet as Polythei&s;m was once univer&s;al, they
<PB N="218" REF="222">
make only two of the many gods that were eve|ry where wor&s;hipped. We have &s;een, that the &s;acred fire was employed in the wor&s;hip of the &s;un, and that images were employed in the wor&s;hip of other deities. Images were originally u&s;ed for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of animating devotion: &s;uch was their u&s;e in Per&s;ia and Hindo&s;tan; and &s;uch was their u&s;e in every country among philo|&s;ophers. The Emperor Julian, in an epi&s;tle to Theodore concerning the images of the gods &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We believe not that the&s;e images are gods: we only u&s;e them in wor&s;hipping the gods."</Q> In the progre&s;s toward idolatry, the next &s;tep is, to imagine, that a deity loves his image, that he makes it his re&s;idence, or at lea&s;t communicates &s;ome virtue to it. The la&s;t &s;tep is, to imagine the image it&s;elf to be a deity; which gained ground imperceptibly as &s;tatuary advanced to|ward perfection. It would be incredible that men of &s;en&s;e &s;hould ever &s;uffer them&s;elves to be im|pre&s;&s;ed with &s;o wild a delu&s;ion, were it not the overbearing influence of religious &s;uper&s;tition. <HI>Credo quia impo&s;&s;ible e&s;t,</HI> is applicable to idolatry as well as to tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. The wor&s;hip|ping the &s;un and moon as deities, is idolatry in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e. With re&s;pect to images, the fir&s;t &s;tep of the progre&s;s is not idolatry: the next is mixed idolatry: and the la&s;t is rank idolatry.</P>
<P>So much upon idolatry. I proceed to what approaches the neare&s;t to it, which is wor&s;hip addre&s;&s;ed to deified mortals. The ancient gods were exalted &s;o little above men, that it was no hard ta&s;k for the imagination to place in heaven, men who had made a figure on earth. The Grecian heaven was entirely peopled with &s;uch men, as well as that of many other nations. Men are deified every day by the Romi&s;h church, under the denomination of &s;aints: per|&s;ons
<PB N="219" REF="223">
are frequently &s;elected for that honour who &s;carce de&s;erved a place on earth, and &s;ome who never had a place there. The Roman Catholics copy the Pagans, in wor&s;hipping the&s;e &s;ubordi|nate divinities by prayers and oblations: and they are well rewarded, by being taken under protec|tion of the&s;e &s;aints in quality of tutelar deities. One branch of the office be&s;towed on the&s;e &s;aints, is to explain the wants of their votaries to the King of heaven, and to &s;upplicate for them. The mediatorial office prevails with re&s;pect to earthly potentates, as well as heavenly: being &s;truck with awe and timidity in approaching tho&s;e exalted above us, we naturally take hold of &s;ome intermediate per&s;on to &s;olicit for us. In ap|proaching the Almighty, the mind, &s;inking down into humility and profound veneration, &s;tops &s;hort, relying upon &s;ome friend in heaven to in|tercede in its behalf. Temples among the Co|chin-Chine&s;e are con&s;tructed with a deep and dark niche, which is their <HI>&s;anctum &s;anctorum.</HI> They hold, that no repre&s;entation, whether by painting or &s;culpture, can be made of God, who is invi&s;ible. The niche denotes his incomprehen|&s;ibility; and the good men placed by them in heaven, are believed to be their interce&s;&s;ors at the throne of grace. The prayers of the Chingu|le&s;e are &s;eldom directed to the &s;upreme being, but to his vicegerents. Interce&s;&s;ors, at the &s;ame time, contribute to the ea&s;e of their votaries: a Roman Catholic need not a&s;&s;ume a very high tone in addre&s;&s;ing a tutelar &s;aint cho&s;en by him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Fal&s;e notions of Providence have prompted groveling mortals to put confidence in mediators and interce&s;&s;ors of a &s;till lower cla&s;s, viz. living mortals, who by idle au&s;terities have acquired a reputation for holine&s;s. Take the following in|&s;tance,
<PB N="220" REF="224">
the &s;tronge&s;t of the kind that can be fi|gured. Louis XI. of France, &s;en&s;ible of the approach of death, &s;ent for a hermit of Calabria, named <HI>Franci&s;co Martarillo;</HI> and throwing him|&s;elf at the hermit's feet in a flood of tears, en|treated him to intercede with God, that his life might be prolonged; as if the voice of a Cala|brian friar, &s;ays Voltaire, could alter the cour&s;e of Providence, by pre&s;erving a weak and per|ver&s;e &s;oul in a worn-out body.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the per&s;ons that are the ob|jects of wor&s;hip, the next &s;tep in order is, to take under view the forms and ceremonies em|ployed in religious wor&s;hip. Forms are nece&s;&s;a|ry where-ever a number of per&s;ons join in one operation: they are e&s;&s;ential in an army, and lit|tle le&s;s e&s;&s;ential at public wor&s;hip. The u&s;e of ceremonies is to excite devotion: but to pre|&s;erve a ju&s;t medium, requires great delicacy of ta&s;te; for though ceremonies are nece&s;&s;ary at public wor&s;hip to prevent languor, yet &s;uperflui|ty of ceremonies quenches devotion, by occupy|ing the mind too much upon externals. The Ro|man-Catholic wor&s;hip is crowded with ceremo|nies: it re&s;embles the Italian opera, which is all &s;ound, and no &s;entiment. The Pre&s;byterian form of wor&s;hip is too naked: it is proper for philo&s;ophers more than for the populace. This is fundamentally the cau&s;e of the numerous &s;ece&s;&s;i|ons from the church of Scotland that have made a figure of late: people di&s;like the e&s;tabli&s;hed forms, when they find le&s;s comfort in public wor&s;hip than is expected; and without being &s;en&s;ible of the real cau&s;e, they chu&s;e pa&s;tors for them&s;elves, who &s;upply the want of ceremonies by loud &s;peaking, with much external fervor and devotion.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="225">
The frequent ablutions or wa&s;hings among the Mahometans and others, as acts of devotion, &s;how the influence that the &s;lighte&s;t re&s;emblances have on the ignorant.

<P>The &s;ect of Ali u&s;e the Alcoran tran&s;lated into the Per&s;ian language, which is their native tongue. The &s;ect of Omar e&s;teem this to be a gro&s;s im|piety; being per&s;uaded, that the Alcoran was written in Arabic, by the Angel Gabriel, at the command of God him&s;elf. The Roman Catho|lics are not then the only people who profe&s;s to &s;peak non&s;en&s;e to God Almighty; or, which is the &s;ame, who profe&s;s to pray in an unknown tongue.</P>
<P>At meals, the ancients poured out &s;ome wine as a libation to the gods: Chri&s;tians pronounce a &s;hort prayer, termed a <HI>grace.</HI></P>
<P>The gro&s;s notion of Deity entertained by the ancients, is exemplified in their wor&s;hipping and &s;acrificing on high places; in order, as they thought, to be more within &s;ight. Jupiter in Homer prai&s;es Hector for &s;acrificing to him fre|quently upon the top of Ida; and Strabo ob&s;erves, that the Per&s;ians, who u&s;ed neither images nor altars, &s;acrificed to the gods in high places. Ba|lak carried Balaam the prophet to the top of Pi&s;|gah, and other mountains, to &s;acrifice there, and to cur&s;e I&s;rael. The votaries of Baal always wor&s;hipped in high places. Even the &s;age Taci|tus was infected with that ab&s;urdity. Speaking of certain high mountains where the gods were wor&s;hipped, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus: <HI>Maxime</HI>

<P>Ceremonies that tend to unhinge morality, be|long more properly to the following &s;ection, treating of the connection between religion and morality.</P>
<P>It is now full time to take under con&s;ideration an objection to the &s;en&s;e of Deity hinted above, ar|guing from the gro&s;s conceptions of deity among many nations, that this &s;en&s;e cannot be innate. The objection is not indeed &s;tated in the follow|ing pa&s;&s;age, borrowed from a ju&s;tly celebrated author; but as it may be implied, the pa&s;&s;age &s;hall be fairly tran&s;cribed. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The univer&s;al pro|pen&s;ity to believe invi&s;ible intelligent power, being a general attendant on human nature, if not an original in&s;tinct, may be con&s;idered as a kind of &s;tamp which the Deity has &s;et upon his work; and nothing &s;urely can more dignify mankind, than to be the only earthly being who bears the &s;tamp or image of the univer&s;al Creator. But con&s;ult this image as it commonly is in popular religions: how is the Deity disfigured! what caprice, ab|&s;urdity, and immorality, are attributed to him<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Natural Hi&s;tory of Religion.</NOTE>!"</Q> A &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to the objecti|on implied in this pa&s;&s;age, will occur, upon re|collecting the progre&s;s of men and nations from infancy to maturity. Our external &s;en&s;es, nece&s;|&s;ary for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, &s;oon arrive at perfec|tion: the more refined &s;en&s;es of propriety, of right and wrong, of Deity, of being accountable
<PB N="223" REF="227">
creatures, and many others of the &s;ame kind, are of &s;lower growth: the &s;en&s;e of right and wrong in particular, and the &s;en&s;e of Deity, &s;eldom reach perfection, but by good education and much &s;tudy. If &s;uch be the ca&s;e among en|lightened nations, what is to be expected from &s;a|vages who are in the lowe&s;t &s;tage of under&s;tand|ing? To a &s;avage of New Holland, who&s;e &s;en&s;e of deity is extremely ob&s;cure, one may talk with|out end of a being who created the world, and who governs it by wi&s;e laws; but in vain; for the &s;avage will be never the wi&s;er. The &s;ame &s;avage hath al&s;o a glimmering of the moral &s;en&s;e, as all men have; and yet in vain will you di&s;|cour&s;e to him of approbation and di&s;approbation, of merit and demerit: of the&s;e terms he has no clear conception. Hence the endle&s;s aberrations of rude and barbarous nations, from pure religion as well as from pure morality. Of the latter there are many in&s;tances collected in the prece|ding tract; and of the former, in&s;tances &s;till more plentiful in the pre&s;ent tract. The &s;en&s;e of deity in dark times has indeed been &s;trangely di&s;|torted by certain bia&s;&s;es and pa&s;&s;ions that en&s;lave the rude and illiterate: but the&s;e yield gradually to the rational faculty as it ripens, and at la&s;t leave religion free to &s;ound philo&s;ophy. Then it is that men, li&s;tening to the innate &s;en&s;e of deity purified from every bias, acquire a clear convic|tion of one &s;upreme Deity who made and go|verns the world.</P>
<P>The foregoing objection then, impartially con|&s;idered, weighs not again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of deity more than again&s;t the moral &s;en&s;e. If it have weight, it re&s;olves into a complaint again&s;t Providence for the weakne&s;s of the &s;en&s;e of deity in rude and illiterate nations. If &s;uch complaint be &s;olidly founded, it pierces extremely deep: why have
<PB N="224" REF="228">
not all nations, even in their na&s;cent &s;tate, the &s;en&s;e of deity, and the moral &s;en&s;e, in purity and perfection? why do they not po&s;&s;e&s;s all the arts of life without nece&s;&s;ity of culture or experience? why are we born poor and helple&s;s infants, in|&s;tead of being produced complete in every mem|ber, internal and external, as Adam and Eve were? The plan of Providence is far above the reach of our weak critici&s;ms. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that as, with re&s;pect to individuals, there is a progre&s;s from infancy to maturity; &s;o there is a &s;imilar progre&s;s in every nation, from its &s;avage &s;tate to its maturity in arts and &s;cien|ces. A child that has ju&s;t conceptions of the Deity and of his attributes, would be a great miracle; and would not &s;uch knowledge in a &s;a|vage be equally &s;o? Nor can I di&s;cover what benefit a child or a &s;avage could reap from &s;uch knowledge; provided it remained a child or a &s;a|vage in every other re&s;pect. The genuine fruits of religion, are gratitude to the Author of our be|ing, veneration to him as the &s;upreme Being, ab|&s;olute re&s;ignation to the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of his Providence, and chearful performance of every duty: but a child has not the &s;lighte&s;t idea of gratitude nor of veneration, and very little of moral duties; and a &s;avage, with re&s;pect to the&s;e, is not much &s;uperior to a child. The formation and government of the world, as far as we know, are excellent: we have great rea&s;on to pre&s;ume the &s;ame with re&s;pect to what we do not know; and every good man will re&s;t &s;atisfied with the following reflection, That we &s;hould have been men from the hour of our birth, complete in every part, had it been conformable to the &s;y&s;|tem of unerring Providence.</P>

<HEAD>Morality con&s;idered as a branch of duty to our Maker.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING travelled long on a rough road, not a little fatiguing, the agreeable part lies before us; which is, to treat of morality as a branch of religion. It was that &s;ubject which induced me to undertake the hi&s;tory of natural religion; a &s;ubject that will afford &s;alutary in|&s;truction, and will in&s;pire true piety, if in&s;truc|tion can produce that effect.</P>
<P>Bayle &s;tarts a que&s;tion, Whether a people may not be happy in &s;ociety, and be qualified for good government, upon principles of morality &s;ingly, without any &s;en&s;e of religion? The que&s;tion is ingenious, and may give opportunity for &s;ubtile rea&s;oning; but it is u&s;ele&s;s, becau&s;e the fact &s;uppo&s;ed cannot happen. The principles of morality and of religion are equally rooted in our nature: they are indeed weak in children and in &s;avages; but they grow up together, and ad|vance toward maturity with equal &s;teps. Where|ever the moral &s;en&s;e is in perfection, a &s;en&s;e of religion cannot be wanting; and if a man who has no &s;en&s;e of religion, live decently in &s;ociety, he is more indebted for his conduct to good tem|per than to &s;ound morals.</P>

We have the authority of the Prophet Micah, formerly quoted, for holding, that religion, or, in other words, our duty to God, con&s;i&s;ts in do|ing ju&s;tice, in loving mercy, and in walking hum|bly with him. The la&s;t is the foundation of re|ligious wor&s;hip, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the foregoing &s;ection: the two former belong to the pre&s;ent head. And if we have gratitude to our Maker and Benefac|tor, if we owe implicit obedience to his will as our rightful &s;overeign, we ought not to &s;eparate the wor&s;hip we owe to him, from ju&s;tice and benevolence to our fellow-creatures; for to be unju&s;t to them, to be cruel or hard-hearted, is a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of his will, no le&s;s gro&s;s than a total neglect of religious wor&s;hip. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ma&s;ter, which is the great commandment in the law?

<P>Morality is thus included in religion. Some nations, however, leave not this propo&s;ition to rea&s;oning or conviction, but ingro&s;s many moral duties in their religious creed. In the 67th chap|ter of the Sadder, a lie is declared to be a great &s;in, and is di&s;charged even where it tends to bring about good. So much purer is the morality of the ancient Per&s;ians than of the pre&s;ent Ju&s;uits. The religion of the people of Pegu, inculcates charity, forbids to kill, to &s;teal, or to injure others. At|tend to the con&s;equence: that people, fierce ori|ginally, have become humane and compa&s;&s;ionate. In a &s;acred book of the ancient Per&s;ians, it is written, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If you incline to be a &s;aint, give good education to your children; for their virtuous actions will be imputed to you."</Q> The people of Japan pay great re&s;pect to their parents; it being an article in their creed, That tho&s;e who fail
<PB N="229" REF="233">
in duty to their parents, will be puni&s;hed by the gods. In the&s;e two in&s;tances, religion tends greatly to connect parents and children in the mo&s;t intimate tie of cordial affection. The reverence the Chine&s;e have for their ance&s;tors, and the ce|remonies performed annually at their tombs, tend to keep them at home, and prevent their wander|ing into foreign countries.</P>
<P>Super&s;titious rites in &s;ome religions, are &s;uc|ce&s;sfully employed to enforce certain moral du|ties. The Romans commonly made their &s;olemn covenants in the capitol, before the &s;tatue of Ju|piter; by which &s;olemnity he was under&s;tood to guarantee the covenant, ready to pour out venge|ance upon the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or. The Burates, a people in Grand Tartary, have a cu&s;tom, which is, to de|mand an oath upon a mountain, held to be &s;acred. They are firmly per&s;uaded, that the per&s;on who &s;wears a fal&s;ehood, will not come down alive. The E&s;&s;enes, a Jewi&s;h &s;ect, bound them&s;elves by a &s;olemn oath, to &s;hun unlawful gain, to be faith|ful to their promi&s;es, not to lie, and never to harm any one. In Cochin-China, the &s;ouls of tho&s;e who have been eminent for arts or arms, are wor&s;hipped. Their &s;tatues are placed in the tem|ples; and the &s;ize of a &s;tatue is proportioned to the merit of the per&s;on repre&s;ented. If that cu&s;tom be executed with candour, there can|not be a nobler incitement to public &s;pirit. The Egyptians did not reach the thought of honouring virtue after death; but they di&s;|honoured vice, by prohibiting it from the Ely&s;ian fields.</P>
<P>The &s;alutary influence of religion on morality, is not confined to pure religion, whether by its connection with morality in general, or by incul|cating particular moral duties. There are many religious doctrines, doubtful or perhaps erroneous,
<PB N="230" REF="234">
that contribute al&s;o to enforce morality. Some followers of Confucius a&s;cribe immortality to the &s;ouls only of the ju&s;t; and believe that the &s;ouls of the wicked peri&s;h with their bodies. In the &s;econd chapter of the Sadder, it is written, that a man who&s;e good works are more numerous than his &s;ins, will go to paradi&s;e; otherwi&s;e that he will be thru&s;t into hell, there to remain for ever. It adds, that a bridge erected over the great aby&s;s where hell is &s;ituated, leads from this earth to pa|radi&s;e; that upon the bridge there &s;tands an angel, who weighs in a balance the merits of the pa&s;&s;en|gers; that the pa&s;&s;enger who&s;e good works are found light in the balance, is thrown over the bridge into hell; but that the pa&s;&s;enger who&s;e good works preponderate, proceeds in his journey to paradi&s;e, where there is a glorious city, gar|dens, rivers, and beautiful virgins, who&s;e looks are a perpetual fea&s;t, but who mu&s;t not be en|joyed. In the fourth chapter of the Sadder, good works are zealou&s;ly recommended in the following parable. Zeradu&s;ht, or Zoroa&s;ter, being in com|pany with God, &s;aw a man in hell who wanted his right foot. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh my Creator," &s;aid Zoro|a&s;ter, who is that man who wants the right foot? God an&s;wered, He was the king of thirty-three cities, reigned many years, but never did any good, except once, when, &s;eeing a &s;heep tyed where it could not reach its food, he with his right foot pu&s;hed the food to it; upon which account, that foot was &s;aved from hell."</Q> In Japan, tho&s;e of the Sinto religion be|lieve, that the &s;ouls of good men are tran&s;lated to a place of happine&s;s, next to the habitation of their gods. But they admit no place of torment; nor have they any notion of a devil, but what animates the fox, a very mi&s;chievous animal in that country. What then becomes of the &s;ouls
<PB N="231" REF="235">
of ill men? Being denied entrance into heaven, they wander about to expiate their &s;ins. Tho&s;e of the Bub&s;do religion believe, that in the other world, there is a place of mi&s;ery as well as of hap|pine&s;s. Of the latter, there are different degrees, for different degrees of virtue; and yet, far from envying the happier lot of others, every inhabi|tant is perfectly &s;atisfied with his own. There are al&s;o different degrees of mi&s;ery; for ju&s;tice requires, that every man be puni&s;hed according to the nature and number of his &s;ins. <HI>Jemma O</HI> is the &s;evere judge of the wicked: their vices ap|pear to him in all their horror, by means of a mirror, named <HI>the mirror of knowledge.</HI> When &s;ouls have expiated their &s;ins, after &s;uffering long in the pri&s;on of darkne&s;s, they are &s;ent back into the world, to animate &s;erpents, toads, and &s;uch vile animals as re&s;embled them in their former exi&s;tence. From the&s;e they pa&s;s into the bodies of more innocent animals; and at la&s;t are again &s;uffered to enter human bodies; after the di&s;&s;o|lution of which, they run the &s;ame cour&s;e of hap|pine&s;s or mi&s;ery as at fir&s;t. The people of Benin, in Africa, believe a man's &s;hadow to be a real being, that gives te&s;timony after death for or again&s;t him; and that he accordingly is made happy or mi&s;erable in another world. A religi|ous belief in ancient Greece, that the &s;ouls of tho&s;e who are left above ground without rites, have no acce&s;s to Ely&s;ium, tended to promote humanity; for tho&s;e who are careful of the dead, will not be altogether indifferent about the living.</P>
<P>Immen&s;e are the ble&s;&s;ings that men in &s;ociety reap, from the union of pure religion with &s;ound morality: but however immen&s;e, I boldly affirm, that they &s;carce counterbalance the manifold evils that &s;ociety has &s;uffered from impure religion,
<PB N="232" REF="236">
indulging and even encouraging gro&s;s immorali|ties. A few of the mo&s;t glaring in&s;tances &s;hall be &s;elected. The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention is, the holding religion to con&s;i&s;t in the belief of points purely &s;peculative, &s;uch as have no relation to good works. The natural effect of that doctrine is, to divorce religion from morality, in manife&s;t contradiction to the will of God. What avails it, for example, to the glory of God, or to the hap|pine&s;s of mankind, whether the conception of the Virgin Mary was maculate or immaculate? The following few in&s;tances, taken out of a large heap, are controver&s;ies of that kind, which mi|&s;erably afflicted the Chri&s;tian church for ages, and engendered the bittere&s;t enmity, raging with de&s;truction and &s;laughter among brethren of the &s;ame religion. In the fifth century, it was the employment of more than one general council, to determine, whether <HI>the mother of God,</HI> or <HI>the mother of Chri&s;t,</HI> is the proper epithet of the Virgin Mary. In the &s;ixth century, a bitter con|trover&s;y aro&s;e, whether Chri&s;t's body was corrup|tible. In the &s;eventh century, Chri&s;tians were divided about the volition of Chri&s;t, whether he had one or two Wills, and how his Will operated. In the eighth and ninth centuries, the Greek and Latin churches divided about the Holy Gho&s;t, whether he proceeded from the Father and Son, or only from the Father. In the eleventh century, there aro&s;e a warm conte&s;t between the Greek and Latin churches, about u&s;ing unleavened bread in the euchari&s;t. In the fourteenth century, it was controverted between Pope John XXII. and the divines of his time, whether &s;ouls in their inter|mediate &s;tate &s;ee God, or only the human nature of Chri&s;t. Franci&s;cans have &s;uffered death in multitudes about the form of their hood. It was di&s;puted between the Dominicans and Franci&s;cans,
<PB N="233" REF="237">
whether Chri&s;t had any property. The Pope pronounced the negative propo&s;ition to be a pe&s;ti|lential and bla&s;phemous doctrine, &s;ubver&s;ive of Catholic faith. Many councils were held at Con|&s;tantinople, to determine what &s;ort of light it was that the di&s;ciples &s;aw on Mount Tabor: it was &s;olemnly pronounced, to be the eternal light with which God is encircled; and which may be term|ed his energy or operation, but is di&s;tinct from his nature and e&s;&s;ence. A heap of propo&s;itions in the creed of St Athana&s;ius, as far as intelligible, are merely &s;peculative, &s;uch as may be adopted or rejected, without the lea&s;t danger to religion, or to morality; and yet we are commanded to be|lieve every one of them, under the pain of eter|nal damnation. An endle&s;s number of &s;uch pro|po&s;itions, adopted by the Romi&s;h church, clearly evince, that Chri&s;tianity was in that church held to con&s;i&s;t entirely in belief, without any regard to good works<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great weight that was laid upon orthodoxy, ap|pears from a triumphal arch erected over the tomb of Charlemagne, upon which was the following in&s;cription: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here lies the body of Charles, a great and orthodox emperor."</Q></NOTE>. Whether the Alcoran was eter|nal, or whether it was created, is a di&s;pute that has occa&s;ioned much effu&s;ion of Mahometan blood. The Calif Mamoun, with many doctors, held it to have been created; but the greater number in&s;i&s;ted, that being the word of God, it mu&s;t like him be eternal. This opinion is em|braced by the pre&s;ent Mahometants, who hold all who deny it to be infidels. There is among men great uniformity of opinion in matters of impor|tance. Religious differences are generally about trifles, where liberty ought to be indulged with|out

It ought therefore to be a fundamental law in every church, to ab&s;tain from loading its creed with articles that are not e&s;&s;ential; for &s;uch articles tend to era|dicate brotherly love, and to convert into bit|ter enemies, men who are fundamentally of the &s;ame faith.</P>
<P>In the next place &s;hall be mentioned, certain articles of faith that tend to &s;ap the very founda|tion of one or other moral duty. What, for ex|ample, can more effectually promote cruelty, than the creed of the Idaans, a people in the i&s;land of Borneo, That every per&s;on they put to death mu&s;t attend them as a &s;lave in the other world? This belief makes them prone to war, and occa&s;ions a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations without end. Accor|ding to the creed of the &s;avages in Canada, the killing and burning enemies are what chiefly en|title them to be happy in another world, and that he who de&s;troys the greate&s;t number, will be the mo&s;t happy. At the &s;ame time, they have no notion of greater happine&s;s there, than plenty of game, great abundance of all things without la|bour, and full gratification of every &s;en&s;ual ap|petite. The Scandinavians had no notion of greater bli&s;s in another world, than to drink beer out of the &s;kull of an enemy, in the hall of Wo|den, their tutelar deity: can hatred and revenge in this world be more honourably rewarded? The doctrine of tutelar deities is equally produc|tive of hatred and revenge: relying on a &s;uperi|or power who e&s;pou&s;es all my quarrels, I put no bounds to my re&s;entment, and every moral duty in oppo&s;ition is trampled under foot. The
<PB N="235" REF="239">
following creed of the inhabitants of the Marian or Ladrone i&s;lands, is a great encouragement to cowardice. Heaven, according to that creed, is a region under the earth, filled with cocoa-trees, &s;ugar-canes, and variety of other delicious fruits. Hell is a va&s;t furnace, con&s;tantly red hot. Their condition in the other world depends not on good or bad actions, but on the manner of their death. Tho&s;e who die a natural death, go &s;traight to heaven: they may &s;in freely, if they can but &s;e|cure their per&s;ons again&s;t violence. But war and blood&s;hed are their aver&s;ion, becau&s;e tho&s;e who &s;uffer a violent death go &s;traight to hell. In ma|ny ancient nations, a godde&s;s was wor&s;hipped, who&s;e province it was to promote animal love without regard to matrimony. That godde&s;s was in Greece termed <HI>Aphrodit&eacute;,</HI> in Rome <HI>Venus,</HI> and in Babylon <HI>Militta.</HI> To her was &s;acrificed, in &s;ome countries, the virginity of young women; which, it was believed, did &s;ecure their cha&s;tity for ever after. Ju&s;tin mentions a cu&s;tom in the i&s;land of Cyprus, of &s;ending young women at &s;tated times to the &s;ea-&s;hore; where they pro&s;ti|tuted them&s;elves as a tribute to Venus, that they might be cha&s;te the re&s;t of their lives. His words are, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pro reliqua pudicitiae libamenta Veneri &s;oluturas<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lib. 18. cap. 5.</NOTE>."</Q> In other nations, a &s;mall number only were pro&s;tituted, in order to &s;ecure to the remainder, a cha&s;te and regular life. This explains a cu&s;tom among the Babylonians, which, far from being thought a religious act, is held as a proof of abandoned debauchery. The cu&s;tom was, That every woman once in her life, &s;hould pro&s;titute her&s;elf in the temple of the godde&s;s Mylitta. Herodotus reports, that there|by

And Aelian ob&s;erves the &s;ame of the Lydian la|dies. <HI>Credat Judaeus Apella.</HI> Margaret Poretta, who in the fourteenth century made a figure among the Beguines, preached a doctrine not a little favourable to incontinence. She undertook to demon&s;trate, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the &s;oul, when ab&s;orbed in the love of God, is free from the re&s;traint of law, and may freely gratify every natural appetite, without contracting guilt;"</Q> a cordial doctrine for a lady of plea&s;ure. That crazy per&s;on, in&s;tead of being laughed at, was burnt alive at Paris. In the fifteenth century, a &s;ect termed <HI>brethren and &s;i&s;ters of the free &s;pirit,</HI> held, That mode&s;ty is a mark of inhering corruption; and that tho&s;e only are perfect, who can behold nakedne&s;s without emotion. The&s;e fanatics ap|peared at public wor&s;hip, without the lea&s;t co|vering. Many tenets profe&s;&s;ed by the Je&s;uits, open a door to every immorality. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Per&s;ons truly wicked, and void of the love of God, may expect eternal life in heaven; provided only they be impre&s;&s;ed with fear of divine an|ger, and avoid heinous crimes through the dread of future puni&s;hment."</Q> Again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Per|&s;ons may tran&s;gre&s;s with &s;afety, who have a probable rea&s;on for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing, &s;uch as any plau&s;ible argument.

And ano|ther Je&s;uit has had the effrontery to maintain, that a monk may lawfully a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate a calumnia|tor, who threatens to charge his order with &s;can|dalous practices.</P>
<P>A doctrine that &s;trikes at the root of every moral duty, as well as of religion it&s;elf, is, That God will accept of a compo&s;ition for &s;in; a doc|trine that prevailed univer&s;ally during the days of ignorance. Compo&s;itions for crimes were coun|tenanced by law in every country<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical law tracts, tract 1.</NOTE>; and men, prone to indulge their pa&s;&s;ions, flattered them|&s;elves, that they might compound with God for &s;inning again&s;t him, as with their neighbours for injuring them. Tho&s;e who have no notion of any motive but intere&s;t, naturally think it to be equally powerful with the Deity. An opinion prevailed univer&s;ally in the Chri&s;tian church, from the eighth century down to the Reforma|tion, that liberal donations to God, to a &s;aint, to the church, would procure pardon even for the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;ins. During that period, the build|ing churches and mona&s;teries was in high vogue. This ab&s;urd or rather impious doctrine, proved a plentiful harve&s;t of wealth to the clergy; for the great and opulent, who are commonly the bolde&s;t &s;inners, have the greate&s;t ability to com|pound for their &s;ins. There needs nothing but &s;uch an opinion, to annihilate every duty, whe|ther
<PB N="238" REF="242">
moral or religious; for what wicked man will think either of re&s;titution or of reformation, who can purcha&s;e a pardon from Heaven with &s;o little trouble? Louis XI. of France was remark|ably &s;uper&s;titious, even in a &s;uper&s;titious age. To ingratiate him&s;elf with the Virgin Mary, he &s;urrendered to her the county of Boulogne with great &s;olemnity. Voltaire remarks, that godli|ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, not in making the Virgin a Coun|te&s;s, but in ab&s;taining from &s;in. Compo&s;ition for &s;ins is a doctrine of the church of Rome, boldly profe&s;&s;ed without di&s;gui&s;e. A book of rates, publi&s;hed by authority of the Pope, contains &s;ta|ted prices for ab&s;olutions, not excepting the mo&s;t heinous &s;ins that men are capable to commit. So true is the ob&s;ervation of Aeneas Silvius, after|ward Pope Paul II. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nihil e&s;t quod ab&s;que argento Romana curia det: ip&s;a manuum im|po&s;itio, et Spiritus Sancti dona, venduntur; nec peccatorum venia ni&s;i nummatis impen|ditur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There is nothing to be obtained from the court of Rome, but by the force of money: even the ceremony of con&s;ecration, and the gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, are &s;old; and the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins is be&s;towed only on tho&s;e who can pay for it."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> Of all the immoral atonements for &s;in, human &s;acrifices are the mo&s;t brutal; devi|ating no le&s;s from the purity of religion, than from the fundamental principles of morality. They wore out of u&s;e as kindly affections pre|vailed; and will never again be re&s;tored, unle&s;s we fall back to the &s;avage manners of our forefa|thers. Compo&s;ition for crimes, once univer&s;al, is now bani&s;hed from every enlightened nation. Compo&s;ition for &s;ins, was once equally univer|&s;al; and I wi&s;h it could be &s;aid, that there are
<PB N="239" REF="243">
now no remains of that poi&s;onous opinion among Chri&s;tians: the practice of the church of Rome will not permit it to be &s;aid. Were men deeply convinced, as they ought to be, that &s;incere re|pentance and reformation of manners are the on|ly means for obtaining pardon, they would never dream of making bargains with the Almighty, and of compounding with him for their &s;ins.</P>
<P>In the practice of religion, the laying too great weight on forms, ceremonies, and other external arbitrary acts, has an unhappy tendency on mo|rality. That error has infected every religion. The Sadder, the Bible of the Gaures, prohibits calumny and detraction, lying, &s;tealing, adulte|ry, and fornication. It however enervates mo|rality and religion, by placing many trifling acts on a level with the mo&s;t important duties. It en|joins the de&s;truction of five kinds of reptiles, frogs, mice, ants, &s;erpents, and flies that &s;ting. It teaches, that to walk barefoot profanes the ground. Great regard for water is enjoined: it mu&s;t not be u&s;ed during the night; and when &s;et upon the fire, a third part of the pot mu&s;t be empty, to prevent boiling over. The bra|mins have wofully degenerated from their origi|nal in&s;titutions, thinking at pre&s;ent, that religion con&s;i&s;ts in forms and ceremonies. As &s;oon as an infant is born, the word <HI>Oum</HI> mu&s;t be pronounc|ed over it; otherwi&s;e it will be eternally mi&s;era|ble: its tongue mu&s;t be rubbed with con&s;ecrated meal: the third day of the moon, it mu&s;t be car|ried into open air, with its head to the north. The inhabitants of Formo&s;a believe in hell; but it is only for puni&s;hing tho&s;e who fail to go naked in certain &s;ea&s;ons, or who wear cotton in&s;tead of &s;ilk. In the time of Ghenhizcan, it was held in Tartary a mortal &s;in, to put a knife into the fire, to whip a hor&s;e with his bridle, or to break one
<PB N="240" REF="244">
bone with another; and yet the&s;e pious Tartars held treachery, robbery, murder, to be no &s;ins. A faction in Aegina, a Greek commonwealth, treacherou&s;ly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated &s;even hundred of their fellow-citizens. They cut off the hands of a mi&s;erable fugitive, who had laid hold of the altar for protection, in order to murder him without the precincts of the temple. Their trea|cherous a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations made no impre&s;&s;ion: but though they refrained from murder in the temple, yet by profaning it with blood, &s;ays Herodotus, they offended the gods, and contracted inexpia|ble guilt. Would one believe, that a tribunal was e&s;tabli&s;hed by Charlemagne more horrible than the inqui&s;ition it&s;elf? It was e&s;tabli&s;hed in We&s;tphalia, to puni&s;h with death every Saxon who eat meat in lent. The &s;ame law was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in Flanders and in French-county, the be|ginning of the &s;eventeenth century.</P>

The command of re&s;ting that day, was taken &s;o lite|rally, that they would not on that day defend them&s;elves even again&s;t an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. Ptolomy, &s;on of Lagus, entered Jeru&s;alem on the Jewi&s;h &s;abbath, in a ho&s;tile manner without re&s;i&s;tance. Nor did experience open the eyes of that fooli&s;h people.

Every Saturday he renewed his bat|teries: and having on that day made a breach, he marched into the town without oppo&s;ition. One cannot help &s;miling at an Am&s;terdam Jew, who had no check of con&s;cience, for breaking open a hou&s;e, and carrying off money; and yet being &s;topped in his flight by the &s;abbath before he got out of the territory, he mo&s;t piou&s;ly re&s;t|ed, till he was apprehended, and led to the gal|lows.

<P>Forms and ceremonies are vi&s;ible acts, which make a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the vulgar. Hence their influence in rea&s;oning and in morality, as we have &s;een in the two &s;ketches immediately forego|ing; and hence al&s;o their influence in religion. Forms and ceremonies are u&s;eful at public wor&s;hip; but they ought not to take place of e&s;&s;entials.

<P>It will be no excu&s;e for relying &s;o much on forms and ceremonies, that they are innocent. In them&s;elves they may be innocent; but not &s;o in their con&s;equences. For they have by &s;uch reli|ance a violent tendency to relax the obligations of morality. Religious rites that contradict not any pa&s;&s;ion, are keenly embraced, and punctually per|formed; and men, flattering them&s;elves that they have thus been punctual in their duty to God, give vent to their pa&s;&s;ions again&s;t men. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They

The&s;e divine per&s;ons were certainly not more regarded, than the Grecian gods, who frequently made part of the <HI>Dramatis per&s;onae</HI> in Greek plays. Many other facts might be urged, to prove the low ebb of religion in tho&s;e days: I &s;elect one or two, which probably will af|ford &s;ome amu&s;ement to the reader. Bartolus, the famous lawyer, in order to &s;hew the form of proceeding in a court of ju&s;tice, imagines a pro|ce&s;s between the devil and mankind. The devil cites mankind to appear at the tribunal of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, claiming them as belonging to him by Adam's fall. He &s;wells in rage, demanding whe|ther any one dares appear in their behalf. Again&s;t the Virgin Mary, offering her&s;elf as their advocate, the devil makes two objections; fir&s;t, That being the mother of the Judge, her influ|ence would be too great; &s;econd, That a woman is debarred from being an advocate: and the&s;e ob|jections are &s;upported by numberle&s;s quotations from the <HI>Corpus Juris.</HI> The Virgin, on her part, quotes texts permitting women to appear for wi|dows, orphans, and for per&s;ons in di&s;tre&s;s.

The memoirs of the French academy of Belles Letters<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vol. 18.</NOTE> have the following &s;tory. A monk returning from a hou&s;e which he dur&s;t not vi&s;it in day-light, had a river to cro&s;s.

religion; for in that ca&s;e they are held to be me|ritorious, as exerted in the cau&s;e of God. This ob&s;ervation is but too well verified in the di&s;putes among Chri&s;tians. However low religion was in the dark ages, yet men fought for forms and cere|monies as <HI>pro aris et focis.</HI> In the Armenian form of bapti&s;m, the prie&s;t &s;ays at the fir&s;t immer&s;ion, <HI>In name of the Father;</HI> at the &s;econd, <HI>In name of the Son;</HI> at the third, <HI>In name of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> This form is bitterly condemned by the Romi&s;h church, which appoints the three per&s;ons of the Trinity to be joined in the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion, in to|ken of their union. Strahlenberg gives an ac|count of a Chri&s;tian &s;ect in Ru&s;&s;ia, which differs from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Greek church in the follow|ing particulars. Fir&s;t, In public wor&s;hip they repeat <HI>Halleluia</HI> but twice; and it is a mortal &s;in to repeat it thrice. Second, In celebrating ma&s;s, not five but &s;even loaves ought to be u&s;ed.

How trifling are the&s;e differences! and yet for &s;uch differences, all who di&s;&s;ent from them are held unclean, and no better than Pagans: they will not eat nor drink with any of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; and if a per&s;on of that church happen to &s;it down in a hou&s;e of theirs, they wa&s;h and purify the &s;eat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;tians, occupied too much with external forms, have corrupted &s;everal of the fine arts.

Nor do the Per&s;ians yield to the Turks in hatred. Whe|ther coffee be or be not prohibited in the Alcoran, has produced much controver&s;y in the Mahome|tan church, and con&s;equently much per&s;ecuting zeal. A mufti, not fond of coffee, declared it, like wine, to have an inebriating quality, and therefore was virtually prohibited by Mahomet. Another mufti, fond of coffee for its exhilarating virtue, declared it lawful; <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"all things are lawful that are not expre&s;sly pro|hibited in the Alcoran."</Q> The coffee-hou&s;es in Con&s;tantinople, were for a long period alternate|ly opened and &s;hut, according to the ta&s;te of the reigning mufti; till coffee at la&s;t, &s;urmounting all ob&s;tacles, came to be an e&s;tabli&s;hed Mahome|tan liquor. Religion thus runs wild, whenever it lo&s;es &s;ight of its true ends, that of wor&s;hipping God, and that of being ju&s;t to man. The Hin|dows hate the Mahometans for eating the fle&s;h of cows: the Mahometans hate the Hindows for eating the fle&s;h of &s;wine. The aver&s;ion that men of the &s;ame religion have at each other for the mo&s;t

A maxim adopted by many pious per&s;ons, has a &s;miling appearance, but in its con&s;equences is hurtful both to religion and morality; which is, That to te&s;tify our veneration for the Deity, and zeal for his &s;ervice, the performing public and private wor&s;hip, and the fulfilling moral duties, are not alone &s;ufficient; that over and above we are bound to fa&s;t, to do penance, to honour the prie&s;thood, and to puni&s;h the enemies of God, <HI>i. e.</HI> tho&s;e who differ from us in principles or practice. This maxim, which may be termed <HI>the doctrine of &s;upererogation,</HI> is finely illu&s;trated by an author mentioned above. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The duties which a man performs as a friend or parent, &s;eem merely owing to his benefactor or chil|dren; nor can he be wanting to the&s;e duties without breaking through all the ties of nature and morality. A &s;trong inclination may prompt him to the performance: a &s;entiment of or|der and moral beauty joins its force to the&s;e natural ties: and the whole man is drawn to his duty without any effort or endeavour. Even with regard to the virtues which are more au&s;tere, and more founded on reflecti|on, &s;uch as public &s;pirit, filial duty, tempe|rance, or integrity: the moral obligation, in our apprehen&s;ion, removes all pretence to religious merit: and the virtuous conduct is e&s;teemed no more than what we owe to &s;ocie|ty, and to our&s;elves. In all this, a &s;uper&s;ti|tious man finds nothing which he has properly performed for the &s;ake of his Deity, or which can peculiarly recommend him to the divine favour and protection. He con&s;iders not, that the mo&s;t genuine method of &s;erving the Divinity is by promoting the happine&s;s of his creatures. He &s;till looks out for &s;ome more immediate &s;ervice of the &s;upreme Being: and

It &s;eems the more purely religious, that it proceeds from no mixture of any other mo|tive or con&s;ideration. And if for its &s;ake he &s;acrifices much of his ea&s;e and quiet, his claim of merit appears &s;till to ri&s;e upon him, in proportion to the zeal and devotion which he di&s;covers.

The mo&s;t extraordinary penance of all, is ce|libacy, con&s;idered as a religious duty. Many fa|thers of the church declare again&s;t matrimony. St. Jerom in particular &s;ays, That the end of matrimony is eternal death; that the earth in|deed is filled by it, but heaven by virginity. The intemperate zeal of many primitive Chri&s;ti|ans led them to ab&s;tain from matrimony, and even from conjugal care&s;&s;es, if they had the misfor|tune to be married; believing that the carnal ap|petite is incon&s;i&s;tent with pure religion. Edward the confe&s;&s;or was &s;ainted, for no better rea&s;on than the ab&s;taining from matrimonial duties. Jovinian, in the fourth century, taught, that all who ob&s;erve the laws of piety and virtue laid down in the go&s;pel, have an equal title to happi|ne&s;s in another life: con&s;equently, that tho&s;e who pa&s;s their days in celibacy and mortification, are in no re&s;pect more acceptable to God than tho&s;e who live virtuou&s;ly in marriage without mortification. He publi&s;hed his opinions in a book, again&s;t which Jerom wrote a bitter and abu&s;ive treati&s;e, &s;till extant. The&s;e opinions were condemned by the church, and by St. Am|bro&s;e, in a council at Milan; and Jovinian was bani&s;hed by the Emperor Honorius. Such ridi|culous &s;elf-denial was not confined to Chri&s;tians. Strabo mentions a &s;ect among the Thracians, who made a vow of perpetual virginity; and were much re&s;pected on that account. Garci|la&s;&s;o mentions virgins in Peru con&s;ecrated to the &s;un: a ve&s;tal guilty of frailty was buried alive, her lover hanged, and the inhabitants of the town where &s;he lived put to the &s;word.

of religion, than an endeavour to put an end to the human &s;pecies? Some glimp&s;es of rea&s;on have abated the zeal of enthu&s;ia&s;ts for celebacy; but have not totally extirpated it, for celibacy of the clergy remains to this day a law in the Ro|mi&s;h church.

This impious re&s;traint, which contradicts the great law of <HI>Increa&s;e and multiply,</HI> has opened the door to gro&s;s debauchery in the pa&s;tors of the Romi&s;h church, though eccle&s;ia&s;tics ought of all men to be the mo&s;t circum&s;pect in their con|duct. Men re&s;trained from what is nece&s;&s;ary and proper, are more prone than others to break out into gro&s;s irregularities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An ingenious writer, mentioned above, makes the following ob&s;ervation. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The celibacy of eccle&s;ia|&s;tics was originally introduced by &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious refinements on the law of God and nature.

<P>The celibacy of the clergy was countenanced by the Pope; and enforced from a political con|&s;ideration,
<PB N="257" REF="261">
That it united the whole clergy into one firm body under his &s;piritual Maje&s;ty. How &s;hort-&s;ighted is man? It was ju&s;tly e&s;teemed at the time to be the corner-&s;tone of Papal power; and yet became the chief cau&s;e of its downfall. Celibacy precipitated the Romi&s;h clergy into adultery, fornication, cunning, di&s;&s;imulation, and every &s;ecret vice. Will men of &s;uch man|ners be li&s;tened to, when they preach purity to their hearers? There was no medium, but ei|ther to reform their own manners, or to give every indulgence to the laity. But the ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition of the latter, rendered the for|mer &s;ecure in their own opinion. The re&s;tora|tion of learning broke the charm. Men begin|ning to think for them&s;elves, were provoked at the di&s;&s;olute lives of their pa&s;tors, and rai&s;ed a loud cry again&s;t them, not yet thinking of their doctrines. Reformers were burnt as heretics; and clergymen were held to be emi&s;&s;aries from Satan, to e&s;tabli&s;h his throne upon earth. Knox, that violent reformer, believed &s;eriou&s;ly, that Cardinal Beaton was <HI>a conjured enemy to Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> Providence brings good out of ill. Had not the clergy been di&s;&s;olute, poor Chri&s;tians might have laboured under ignorance and eccle&s;i|a&s;tical thraldom to this hour. Our reformers, beginning with their pa&s;tors, extended in&s;en&s;ibly their hatred to the doctrines taught by their pa&s;|tors. Every article of faith was &s;ifted: the chaff was &s;eparated from the corn; and a reformation was e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the &s;criptures, rejecting every innovation of the Romi&s;h church.</P>
<P>There is not mentioned in hi&s;tory a more impu|dent attack upon moral principles, than a privilege a&s;&s;umed by the Bi&s;hop of Rome, to di&s;engage men from their oaths and promi&s;es: it is not a greater
<PB N="258" REF="262">
&s;tretch to di&s;engage them from every duty, whe|ther of morality or of religion. The barons of Va|lentia, dreading a per&s;ecution again&s;t the indu&s;tri|ous Moors, their tenants, obtained the following clau&s;e to be in their king's coronation-oath: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he &s;hould not expel the Mori&s;cos, nor force them to be baptized; that he &s;hould never de&s;ire to be relieved from the oath by a di&s;pen&s;ation from the Pope, nor accept a di&s;pen&s;ation if offe|red."</Q> The Emperor Charles V. took this oath &s;olemnly in pre&s;ence of his nobles; and yet accepted a di&s;pen&s;ation from the Pope, ab&s;olving him from the oath, and from the guilt of perjury in breaking it. Augu&s;tus King of Poland, in the treaty of Altram&s;tadt, renounced the kingdom of Poland to his competitor Stani&s;laus. The defeat of the King of Sweden at Poltowa, was an invi|ting opportunity to renew his preten&s;ions. A &s;o|lemn treaty &s;tood in his way; but the Pope re|moved that ob&s;tacle, by annulling the treaty, and &s;etting him at liberty. The Pope has been known even to be&s;tow that wonderful privilege upon others. Pope Pa&s;cal II. having with a &s;o|lemn oath renounced the right of inve&s;titures, empowered the cardinals to declare his oath null. Bi&s;hops al&s;o, imitating their &s;uperior, have a&s;&s;u|med the privilege of di&s;pen&s;ing with moral du|ties. In&s;tances are not rare, of curates being au|thorized by their bi&s;hop to entertain concubines, paying for each a regular tax of a crown yearly. Nay, in &s;ome provincial &s;ynods, they are enjoin|ed to keep concubines, in order to prevent &s;can|dal. Common pro&s;titutes, licen&s;ed in the city of Leghorn, have a church peculiar to them&s;elves, and mu&s;t not enter into any other.

<P><PB N="259" REF="263">
The power of be&s;towing kingdoms, a&s;&s;umed by the bi&s;hop of Rome, was an encroachment on the rules of ju&s;tice, no le&s;s bold. Chri&s;tian prin|ces, not many ages ago, e&s;teemed the Pope's gift to be their be&s;t title of property. In the year 1346, the Venetians reque&s;ted the Pope's per|mi&s;&s;ion to carry on commerce in A&s;ia, and to purcha&s;e there pepper and cinnamon. The Pope not only granted their reque&s;t, but pronounced anathemas upon any who &s;hould dare to inter|fere in that commerce. Ferdinand and I&s;abella of Spain, applied to Pope Alexander VI. to ve&s;t in them the property of America, di&s;covered un|der their au&s;pices by Columbus. The Pope ha|ving formerly made a grant to the kings of Por|tugal, of their di&s;coveries in the Ea&s;t Indies, both grants were held &s;acred; and it came to be &s;tre|nuou&s;ly di&s;puted, under which of the grants the Molucca i&s;lands were comprehended. Both grants proceed upon a narrative, of the power be&s;tow|ed by Almighty God on the Pope as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to St Peter and vicar of Chri&s;t. To imagine, that the Almighty would be&s;tow &s;uch powers on the Bi&s;hop of Rome, or on any human being, &s;hews gro&s;s ignorance of the common rights of man|kind, and of the government of Providence.</P>
<P>The gro&s;&s;e&s;t of all deviations, not only from &s;ound morality but from pure religion, and the mo&s;t exten&s;ive in its baneful effects, is a doctrine embraced by e&s;tabli&s;hed churches, not many ex|cepted, That becau&s;e heretics are odious in the &s;ight of God, it is the duty of the orthodox to extirpate them root and branch. Ob&s;erve the con&s;equence: people who differ from the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church, are held to be ob&s;tinate &s;inners, de&s;erving puni&s;hment here as well as hereafter.

<P>The old Romans, far from having any notion of per&s;ecution, adopted the gods of every nation they conquered. A learned writer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Morinus.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, that as the number of their gods increa&s;ed with their conque&s;ts, it is po&s;&s;ible that they might have wor&s;hipped all the gods in the world. Their be|lief in tutelar deities produced that effect. Titus Livius mentions a &s;ect of Bacchanals that &s;pread through Italy. They performed their ceremonies during night, men and women mix|ing in the dark after intemperate eating and drink|ing. Never did wicked wretches de&s;erve more exemplary puni&s;hment; yet li&s;ten to the follow|ing decree of the Roman &s;enate, breathing the true &s;pirit of toleration. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ne qua Bacchana|lia Romae, neve in Italia e&s;&s;ent.

<PB N="261" REF="265">
per&s;ecution; for though they con&s;idered the Su|preme Being as their tutelar deity, yet the malig|nity of their nature prevailed to make them hold in abhorrence the wor&s;hip of every other god. Even among them&s;elves, they were abundantly di&s;po&s;ed to war; and nothing kept within bounds the Phari&s;ees, the Sadduces, and the E&s;&s;enes, their three &s;ects, but terror of the Roman pow|er. The Chri&s;tian religion implies toleration in its very nature and principles; but being corrup|ted by ignorance, intere&s;t, and &s;uper&s;tition, it became prone to per&s;ecution, above all others. Chri&s;tian &s;ects were enflamed again&s;t each other to a degree of brutality; the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to peace and brotherly love, inculcated in the go&s;|pel. It was propagated by the orthodox, that Arius expired in a common jakes, and that his entrails bur&s;t out. The &s;ame is related of Hune|ric King of the Vandals, a zealous Arian; with the following addition, that being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the devil, whom he had glutted with the blood of many martyrs, he tore his fle&s;h off with his teeth, and ended his wretched life in the mo&s;t excruciating, though ju&s;tly de&s;erved, torments. The fal&s;ehoods every where &s;pread during the fourteenth century again&s;t the Jews, &s;uch as their poi&s;oning the public fountains, killing Chri&s;tian

The greater part of per&s;e|cutions have been occa&s;ioned in the &s;ame man|ner; for men are not &s;o de&s;perately wicked, as to approve of per&s;ecution, unle&s;s when blinded by intemperate zeal. The &s;ame religious hatred produced the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the Duke of Gui&s;e, and of two Henrys, Kings of France; produced the gun-powder plot; and produced the mo&s;t horrid deed that ever was perpetrated among men, the ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bartholomew<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;ieur de Tavannes, afterward Mare&s;chal of France, was a great parti&s;an of the Queen-mother, and &s;o active in the ma&s;&s;acre, that with his own hand he murdered no fewer than &s;eventeen Huguenots.

<P>No fal&s;e principle in religion has &s;hed more in|nocent, or rather virtuous blood, than that of per&s;ecuting heretics; <HI>i. e.</HI> tho&s;e who differ in any article from the religion e&s;tabli&s;hed by law. The doctrine of burning heretics, is in effect the profe&s;&s;ing to burn men highly virtuous; for they mu&s;t be &s;o in an eminent degree, who &s;ubmit to be burnt alive, rather than be guilty even of di&s;&s;imulation. The Mahometan practice of con|verting people by the &s;word, if not more rati|onal, is at lea&s;t more manly. Louis IX. of France, one of its be&s;t princes, would have been a greater ble&s;&s;ing to his people, had he been le&s;s
<PB N="263" REF="267">
pious: he had an implacable aver&s;ion to here|tics, again&s;t whom he thought it more proper to employ racks and gibbets, than argument and per&s;ua&s;ion. Torquemada, that infernal inqui&s;i|tor of Spain, brought into the inqui&s;ition, in the &s;pace of fourteen years, no fewer than 80,000 per&s;ons; of whom 6000 were condemned to the flames, and burnt alive with the greate&s;t pomp and exultation. Of that va&s;t number, there was perhaps not a &s;ingle per&s;on, who was not more pure in religion, as well as in morals, than their outrageous per&s;ecutor. Hunter a young man about nineteen years of age, was one of the unhappy victims to the zeal of Queen Mary of England for Popery. Having been inadvertently betrayed by a prie&s;t to deny tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, he ab&s;con|ded, to keep out of harm's way. Bonner, that arch-hangman of Popery, threatened ruin to the father, if he did not deliver up the young man. Hunter, hearing of his father's danger, made his appearance; and was burnt alive, in&s;tead of be|ing rewarded for his filial piety. A woman of Guern&s;ey was brought to the &s;take, without re|gard to her big belly; which bur&s;ting by the tor|ture, &s;he was delivered in the mid&s;t of the flames. One of the guards &s;natched the infant from the fire: but the magi&s;trate who attended the execution, ordered it to be thrown back; be|ing re&s;olved, he &s;aid, that nothing &s;hould &s;ur|vive which &s;prung from a parent &s;o ob&s;tinately heretical. Father Paul (Council of Trent, book 5.) computes, that in the Netherlands alone, from the time that the edict of Charles V. was promulgated again&s;t the reformers, fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons were hanged, beheaded, buried alive, or burnt, on account of religion. Some Faquirs, crazed with opium and fanatici&s;m, have been known with poi&s;oned daggers to fall upon
<PB N="264" REF="268">
uncircumci&s;ed Europeans, and to put every one to death whom they could ma&s;ter. In the la&s;t century, a Faquir at Surate murdered, within the &s;pace of a minute, &s;eventeen Dutch &s;ailors with &s;eventeen &s;tabs of a dagger. We think with horror of human &s;acrifices among the ancient Pa|gans; and yet we behold them every day among Chri&s;tians, rendered &s;till more horrid by the mo&s;t atrocious torments that religious hatred can de|vi&s;e.</P>
<P>The great motive to &s;uch cruelties, is the &s;u|per&s;titious and ab&s;urd notion, that heretics are God's enemies; which makes it thought an ac|ceptable &s;ervice to God, not only to per&s;ecute them by fire and &s;word in this world, but to deli|ver them over to Satan in the world to come. Another circum&s;tance enflames religious hatred; which is, that neighbours are either intimate friends or bitter enemies. This holds with a &s;light variation in &s;ects of the &s;ame religion: however minute their differences be, they can|not be intimate friends; and therefore are bitter enemies: the nearer they approach to uni&s;on, if not entirely concordant, the greater in proportion is their mutual natred. Such hatred, &s;ubduing the meek &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, is an additional cau&s;e for per&s;ecution. Blind zeal for what is be|lieved to be the only true religion, never di&s;co|vers error nor innocence in tho&s;e who differ, but perver&s;ene&s;s and criminal ob&s;tinacy. Two reli|gions totally different, like two countries in op|po&s;ite parts of the globe, produce no mutual enmity. At the &s;iege of Con&s;tantinople by the Turks, ann. 1453, the Emperor, in order to procure a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the princes of the Latin church, ordered ma&s;s to be celebrated in one of his churches according to the form u&s;ed in Rome. The people with great indignation prote&s;ted,
<PB N="265" REF="269">
that they would rather &s;ee the Turks in their churches, than the hat of a cardinal.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the Walden&s;es, tho' well known, cannot be too often repeated. In the twelfth cen|tury, a merchant of Lyons, named <HI>Peter Valdo,</HI> di&s;&s;atisfied with the pomp and ceremonies of the Romi&s;h church, ill &s;uited, in his opinion, to the humility of a Chri&s;tian, retired to a de&s;ert in the high country of Provence, with &s;everal poor peo|ple his di&s;ciples. There he became their &s;piritu|al guide, in&s;tructing them in certain doctrines, the &s;ame that were afterward adopted by the Pro|te&s;tants. Their ince&s;&s;ant labour &s;ubdued the bar|ren &s;oil, and prepared it for grain as well as for pa&s;ture. The rent which in time they were ena|bled to pay for land that afforded none originally, endeared them to their landlords. In 250 years, they multiplied to the number of 18,000, occu|pying thirty villages, be&s;ide hamlets, the work of their own hands. Prie&s;ts they had none, nor any di&s;putes about religion: neither had they occa|&s;ion for a court of ju&s;tice, as brotherly love did not &s;uffer them to go to law: they wor&s;hipped God in their own plain way, and their innocence was &s;ecured by ince&s;&s;ant labour. They had long enjoyed the &s;weets of peace and mutual affection, when the reformers of Germany and Geneva &s;ent mini&s;ters among them; which unhappily laid them open to religious hatred, the mo&s;t unrelent|ing of all furies. In the year 1540, the parlia|ment of Provence condemned nineteen of them to be burnt for here&s;y, their trees to be rooted up, and their hou&s;es to be razed to the ground. The Walden&s;es, terrified at this &s;entence, applied in a body to Cardinal Sadolet, bi&s;hop of Carpentras; who received them kindly, and obtained from Francis I. of France, a pardon for the per&s;ons under &s;entence of death, on condition of abjur|ing
<PB N="266" REF="270">
here&s;y. The matter lay over five years; when the parliament, irritated at them for per&s;e|vering in their tenets, prevailed on the King to withdraw his pardon. The &s;entence was execut|ed with great rigour; and the parliament, laying hold of that opportunity, broke through every re&s;traint of law, and commenced a violent per&s;e|cution again&s;t the whole nation. The &s;oldiers began with ma&s;&s;acring old men, women, and children, all having fled who were able to fly; and proceeded to burn their hou&s;es, barns, and corn. There remained in the town of Cabriere &s;ixty men and thirty women; who having &s;urren|dered upon promi&s;e of life, were butchered each of them without mercy. Some women who had taken refuge in a church, were dragged out, and burnt alive. Twenty-two villages were reduced to a&s;hes; and that populous and flouri&s;hing di|&s;trict, became once more a de&s;ert.</P>
<P>To conceive this horrid &s;cene in all its defor|mity, the people per&s;ecuted ought to be compar|ed with the clergy their per&s;ecutors; for the civil magi&s;trate was the hand only that executed their vengeance: on the one &s;ide, an indu&s;trious peo|ple, pure in their morals, and no le&s;s pure in their religion: on the other, proud pampered prie&s;ts, abandoned without &s;hame to every wick|edne&s;s, impure in their morals, and &s;till more impure in their religion&mdash;the world never furni&s;h|ed &s;uch another contra&s;t. Had the &s;cene been rever&s;ed, to make the&s;e wretches &s;uffer per&s;ecu|tion from the Walden&s;es&mdash;but that people were too upright and too religious for being per&s;ecutors. The manners of the Chri&s;tian clergy in general, before the Reformation, enlivens the contra&s;t. The doctrine promulgated during the dark times of Chri&s;tianity, That God is a mercenary being; and that every per&s;on, however wicked, may ob|tain
<PB N="267" REF="271">
pardon of his &s;ins by money, made riches flow into the hands of eccle&s;ia&s;tics in a plentiful &s;tream. And riches had the &s;ame effect upon the Chri&s;tian clergy that they have upon all men, which is, to produce pride, &s;en&s;uality, and pro|fligacy: the&s;e again produced di&s;&s;ipation of mo|ney, which prompted avarice, and every inven|tion for recruiting exhau&s;ted trea&s;ures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, many of the clergy dealt in merchandi&s;e; and, being free of taxes, engro&s;&s;ed all. In the Netherlands particularly, there was a great cry, that mona&s;teries were convert|ed into &s;hops and ware-hou&s;es, and the man&s;ions of &s;ecular prie&s;ts into tap-hou&s;es and inns.</NOTE>. Even as early as the eighth century, the Chri&s;tian clergy, tempted by opulence, abandoned them|&s;elves to plea&s;ure, without moderation; and far exceeded the laity in luxury, gluttony, and lu&s;t. When &s;uch were the pa&s;tors, what mu&s;t have been the flock! Rejoice, O Scotland, over the poverty and temperance of thy pa&s;tors. During that period, the clergy could read, and, like parrots, they could mumble prayers in Latin: in every other re&s;pect, they rivalled the laity in ignorance. They were indeed more cunning than the laity; and under&s;tood their intere&s;t better, if to covet riches at the expence of probity, de|&s;erve that name. Three articles were e&s;tabli&s;hed that made religion an ea&s;y &s;ervice. Fir&s;t, That faith is the e&s;&s;ence of religion, without regard to good works; and hence the nece&s;&s;ity of being &s;trictly orthodox, which the church only could determine. Second, Religious wor&s;hip was re|duced to a number of external ceremonies and forms, which, being declared &s;ufficient for &s;alva|tion, ab&s;olved Chri&s;tians from every moral duty.
<PB N="268" REF="272">
Remark, that a prie&s;t is always the chief per&s;on in ceremonial wor&s;hip. The third article, That God is a mercenary being, is mentioned above, with its nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences. The&s;e articles brought about a total neglect, both in clergy and laity, not only of morality, but of every e&s;&s;en|tial religious duty. In fine, there never was a religion that deviated more from ju&s;t principles, than that profe&s;&s;ed by Chri&s;tians during the dark ages. Per&s;ecution reached none but the &s;incerely pious and virtuous. What a glorious tolerating &s;entiment doth Arnobius<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1.

And Abraham's zeal was kindled again&s;t the man, and he aro&s;e, and fell upon him, and drove him forth with blows into the wilderne&s;s. And God called unto Abraham, &s;aying, Abraham, where is the &s;tranger? And Abraham an&s;wer|ed and &s;aid, Lord, he would not wor&s;hip thee, neither would he call upon thy name; there|fore have I driven him out from before my face into the wilderne&s;s. And God &s;aid, Have I borne with him the&s;e hundred ninety and eight years, and nouri&s;hed him, and clothed him, notwith&s;tanding his rebellion again&s;t me; and could&s;t not thou, who art thy&s;elf a &s;inner, bear with him one night?"</Q> The hi&s;torical &s;tyle of the Old Te&s;tament is here finely imitat|ed; and the moral mu&s;t &s;trike every one who is not &s;unk in &s;tupidity and &s;uper&s;tition. Were it really a chapter of Gene&s;is, one is apt to think, that per&s;ecution could never have &s;hown a bare face among Jews or Chri&s;tians. But alas! that is a vain thought. Such a pa&s;&s;age in the Old
<PB N="270" REF="274">
Te&s;tament, would avail as little again&s;t the ran|corous pa&s;&s;ions of men, as the following pa&s;&s;ages in the New Te&s;tament, tho' per&s;ecution cannot be condemned in terms more explicit. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Him that is weak in the faith, receive you, but not to doubtful di&s;putations. For one believ|eth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. Let not him that eat|eth, de&s;pi&s;e him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth. Who art thou that judge&s;t another man's &s;er|vant? to his own ma&s;ter he &s;tandeth or falleth. One man e&s;teemeth one day above another: another e&s;teemeth every day alike. Let eve|ry man be fully per&s;uaded in his own mind. But why do&s;t thou judge thy brother? or why do&s;t thou &s;et at nought thy brother? for we &s;hall all &s;tand before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t, every one to give an account of him|&s;elf to God. I know, that there is nothing unclean of it&s;elf: but to him that e&s;teemeth any thing unclean, to him it is unclean. The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;tle of Paul to the Romans, chap. 14.</NOTE>."</Q> Our Saviour him&s;elf declared again&s;t per&s;ecution in the mo&s;t expre&s;s terms. The Jews and Samari|tans were of the &s;ame religion; but &s;ome trivial differences in the ceremonial part of wor&s;hip, rendered them odious to each other. Our Savi|our being refu&s;ed lodging in a village of Samaria, becau&s;e he was travelling to Jeru&s;alem, his di&s;ci|ples James and John &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lord, wilt thou that

<P>It gives me real concern, that even the hot fire of per&s;ecution, did not altogether purify our Reformed clergy from that &s;atanical &s;pirit. No &s;ooner were the Di&s;&s;enters &s;ettled in New Eng|land, where they fled to avoid per&s;ecution, than they &s;et on foot a per&s;ecution again&s;t the Quakers, no le&s;s furious than what they them&s;elves had &s;uffered at home. Nor did the Reformed clergy in Scotland lo&s;e &s;ight of that magi&s;terial autho|rity, which had been a&s;&s;umed by their predece&s;|&s;ors of the Romi&s;h church, on the ridiculous pre|text, of being amba&s;&s;adors to men from Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Upon a repre&s;entation, ann. 1646, from the commi&s;&s;ion of the kirk of Scotland, James Bell and Colin Campbell, bailies of Gla&s;gow, were committed to pri&s;on by the parliament, merely for having &s;aid, that kirk-men meddled too much in civil matters. Could a de&s;potic prince have exerted a more arbitrary act? but the church was all-powerful in tho&s;e days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Toleration in religion, though obvious to com|mon under&s;tanding, was not however the production of rea&s;on, but of commerce. The advantage of tolera|tion for promoting commerce, was di&s;covered long be|fore by the Portugue&s;e. They were too zealous Ca|tholics to venture &s;o bold a mea&s;ure in Portugal; but it was permitted in Goa, and the inqui&s;ition in that town was confined to Roman Catholics.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="276">
I would do ju&s;tice to every church, not except|ing that of Rome; and it is doing that church no more but ju&s;tice to acknowledge, that the &s;pirit of per&s;ecution was not more eminent in it, than zeal for making converts. The former is retiring out of the world; and I wi&s;h it mo&s;t profound re&s;t, never again to revive. People begin to be a&s;hamed of it, as of a garment long out of fa|&s;hion. Let the other continue for amu&s;ement: it is innocent; and if it do no good, it is not productive of &s;o much harm.</P>
<P>The de&s;ire of making converts proceeds from two different cau&s;es. In &s;uper&s;titious zealots, it proceeds from an opinion, that all who differ from them are in the road to damnation: for which rea&s;on, there is a rage of making converts among Roman Catholics; who, without ceremony, de|liver over to the flames of hell, every per&s;on who is not of their communion The other cau&s;e is more natural: every man thinks him&s;elf in the right, e&s;pecially in matters of con&s;equence; and for that rea&s;on, he is happy to find others of his opinion<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, vol. 2. p. 493. edit. 5.</NOTE>. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t cau&s;e, I beg attention to the following con&s;iderations; not with any hope of converting zealots, but to pre|vent, if po&s;&s;ible, others from becoming &s;uch. In none of the works of God is variety more hap|pily blended with uniformity, than in the forma|tion of man. Uniformity prevails in the human face with re&s;pect to eyes, no&s;e, mouth, and other capital parts: variety prevails in the expre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e parts, &s;erving to di&s;tingui&s;h one per&s;on from another, without hazard of error. In like manner, the minds of men are uniform with re|&s;pect to their pa&s;&s;ions and principles; but the va|rious
<PB N="273" REF="277">
tones and expre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e, form diffe|rent characters without end. A face de&s;titute of a no&s;e or of a mouth, is mon&s;trous: a mind de|&s;titute of the moral &s;en&s;e, or of a &s;en&s;e of reli|gion, is no le&s;s &s;o. But variety of expre&s;&s;ion in different faces, is agreeable: becau&s;e we reli&s;h variety; and a &s;imilar variety in the expre&s;&s;ions or tones of pa&s;&s;ion, ought to be equally agreeable. Endle&s;s differences in temper, in ta&s;te, and in mental faculties, that of rea&s;on in particular, produce nece&s;&s;arily variety in &s;entiment and in opinion. Can God be di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;uch vari|ety, when it is his own work? He requires no uniformity except with re&s;pect to an upright mind and clear con&s;cience, which are indi&s;pen&s;able. Here at the &s;ame time is di&s;covered an illu&s;trious final cau&s;e. Different countenances in the hu|man race, not only di&s;tingui&s;h one per&s;on from another, but promote &s;ociety, by aiding us to chu&s;e a friend, an a&s;&s;ociate, a partner for life. Differences in opinion and &s;entiment, have &s;till more beneficial effects: they rou&s;e the attention, give exerci&s;e to the under&s;tanding, and &s;harpen the rea&s;oning faculty. With re&s;pect to religion in particular, perfect uniformity, which furni&s;h|eth no &s;ubject for thinking nor for rea&s;oning, would produce languor in divine wor&s;hip, and make us &s;ink into cold indifference. How fran|tic then is the rage of making pro&s;elytes? Let every man enjoy his native liberty, of thinking as well as of acting; free to act as he plea&s;es, provided he obey the rules of morality; equally free to think as he plea&s;es, provided he obey the great God as his maker and ma&s;ter, and acknow|ledge the nece&s;&s;ary connection of religion with morality. Strict uniformity in other matters, may be compared to a &s;pring-day, calm and &s;e|rene; neither &s;o hot as to make us drop a gar|ment,
<PB N="274" REF="278">
nor &s;o cold as to require an addition; no wind to ruffle, nor rain to make &s;helter nece&s;&s;ary. We enjoy the &s;weet &s;cene for a moment: we walk, we &s;it, we mu&s;e;&mdash;but &s;oon fall a&s;leep. Agitation is the element of man, and the life of &s;ociety. Let us not attempt to correct the works of God: the attempt will betray us into ab&s;urd errors. This doctrine cannot be better illu&s;tra|ted than by a conver&s;ation, reported by the Je&s;uit Tachard, between the king of Siam, and a French amba&s;&s;ador, who, in his ma&s;ter's name, urged that king to embrace the Chri&s;tian religion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am &s;urpri&s;ed,"</Q> &s;aid his Maje&s;ty of Siam, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the King of France, my good friend, &s;hould intere&s;t him&s;elf &s;o warmly in what con|cerns God only. He hath given to his crea|tures different minds and different inclinations, which naturally lead them two differ in opinion. We admire variety in the material world: why not equally admire it in matters of religi|on? Have we not then rea&s;on to believe, that God takes plea&s;ure in all the different forms of wor&s;hip? Had it been the intention of God to produce uniformity in religion, he would have formed all men with the &s;ame mind."</Q> Bernier introduces &s;ome Gentiles of Hindo&s;tan defending their religion much in the &s;ame manner: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That they did not pretend their law to be univer&s;al; that they did not hold ours to be fal&s;e, as, for aught they knew, it might be a good law for us; and that God probably made many roads to heaven."</Q></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the other cau&s;e above mentio|ned, viz. the de&s;ire of putting people in the right road. To rea&s;on others into our religious principles, is natural; but it is not always pru|dent. I wi&s;h my neighbour to be of my opinion, becau&s;e I think my opinion right: but is there no
<PB N="275" REF="279">
danger of undermining his religious principles, without e&s;tabli&s;hing better in their &s;tead? Ought I not to re&s;train my de&s;ire of making converts, when the attempt may po&s;&s;ibly reduce them to abandon religion altogether, as a matter of utter uncertainty? If a man of clear under&s;tanding has by &s;ome unhappy means been led into error, that man may be &s;et right by fair rea&s;oning: but beware of endeavouring to convert people of low parts, who are indebted for their creed to parents, to education, or to example: it is &s;afer to let them re&s;t as they are.</P>
<P>At any rate, let us never attempt to gain pro|&s;elytes by rewards nor by terror: what other ef|fect can &s;uch motives produce, but di&s;&s;imulation and lying, parents of every &s;ecret crime? The Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia u&s;es a method for converting her Pagan &s;ubjects of Kam&s;katka, no le&s;s agree|able than effectual; which is, to exempt from taxes for ten years, &s;uch of them as profe&s;s the Chri&s;tian religion. This practice may be politi|cal; but it tends not to advance religion, and is de&s;tructive of morality. Terror, on the other hand, may be equally effectual, but is not alto|gether &s;o agreeable. The people of Rum, one of the Hebrides, were Papi&s;ts till the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, when in one day they were all pro&s;elyted to the Prote&s;tant faith. Ma|clean of Coll, their chieftain, went to the i&s;land with a Prote&s;tant mini&s;ter, and ordered all the inhabitants to appear on Sunday at public wor&s;hip. They came, but refu&s;ed to hear a Prote&s;tant mi|ni&s;ter. The chieftain rea&s;oned with them: but finding that his rea&s;onings made no impre&s;&s;ion, he laid hold of the mo&s;t forward; and having made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on him with his cane, pu&s;hed him into the church. The re&s;t followed like meek lambs; and from that day have conti|nued
<PB N="276" REF="280">
firm Prote&s;tants. The Prote&s;tanti&s;m of Rum is &s;tyled by their Popi&s;h neighbours, the faith of the <HI>yellow &s;tick.</HI></P>
<P>To apply rewards, terror, or any other means, for making pro&s;elytes, except fair rea&s;oning, ap|pears to me a &s;trange perver&s;ion. Can God be plea&s;ed with &s;uch means, or can any rational man ju&s;tify them? What then &s;hould move any one to put them in practice? I &s;hould be utterly at a lo&s;s to an&s;wer the que&s;tion, but for a fact men|tioned more than once above, that the rude and illiterate, judge by &s;ight only, and not by reflec|tion, which makes them lay weight on the exter|nal vi&s;ible act, without thinking of intention, becau&s;e it is not vi&s;ible. In truth, the bulk of mankind re&s;t upon the external profe&s;&s;ion of reli|gion: they never dip into the heart, nor con&s;ider how that &s;tands affected. What el&s;e is it but the external act merely, that moves the Romi&s;h mi&s;|&s;ionaries to baptize the infants of &s;avages even at the moment of expiring? which they pro&s;ecute with much pious ardour. Their zeal merits ap|plau&s;e, but by no means their judgment. Can any rational per&s;on &s;eriou&s;ly believe, that the dip|ping a &s;avage or an infant in water, will make ei|ther of them a Chri&s;tian, or that the want of this ceremony will precipitate them into hell? The Lithuanians, before their conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tia|nity wor&s;hipped &s;erpents, every family entertain|ing one as a hou&s;ehold god. Sigi&s;mundus, in his commentaries of Mu&s;covy, reports the fol|lowing incident. A converted Chri&s;tian having per&s;uaded a neighbour to follow his example, and in token of his conver&s;ion to kill his &s;erpent, was &s;urpri&s;ed at his next vi&s;it, to find his convert in the deepe&s;t melancholy, bitterly lamenting that he had murdered his god, and that the mo&s;t dreadful calamities would befal him. Was this
<PB N="277" REF="281">
per&s;on a Chri&s;tian more than nominally? At the end of the la&s;t century when Kempfer was in Ja|pan, there remained but about fifty Japan Chri|&s;tians, who were locked up in pri&s;on for life. The&s;e poor people knew no more of the Chri&s;ti|an religion, but the names only of our Saviour and of the Virgin Mary; and yet &s;o zealous Chri&s;tians were they, as rather to die mi&s;erably in jail, than to renounce the name of Chri&s;t, and be &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>I cannot with &s;atisfaction conclude this &s;ketch, without congratulating my pre&s;ent countrymen of Britain, upon their knowledge of the intimate connection that true religion has with morality. May the importance of that connection, always at heart, excite us to govern every action of our lives by the united principles of morality and re|ligion:&mdash;what a happy people would we be!</P>

<HEAD>SCOTCH ENTAILS con&s;idered in Moral and Political views.</HEAD>
<P>MAN is by nature a hoarding animal; and to &s;ecure to men what they acquire by hone&s;t indu&s;try, the &s;en&s;e of property is made a branch of human nature<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 1. &s;ketch 3.</NOTE>. During the in|fancy of nations, when artificial wants are un|known, the hoarding appetite makes no figure. The u&s;e of money produced a great change in the human heart. Money having at command the goods of fortune, introduced inequality of rank, luxury, and artificial wants without end. No bounds are &s;et to hoarding, where an appetite for artificial wants is indulged: love of money be|comes
<PB N="279" REF="283">
the ruling pa&s;&s;ion: it is coveted by many in order to be hoarded; and means are ab&s;urdly converted into an end.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of property, weak among &s;avages, ripens gradually till it arrives at maturity in po|li&s;hed nations. In every &s;tage of the progre&s;s, &s;ome new power is added to property; and now for centuries, men have enjoyed every power over their own goods, that a rational mind can de&s;ire<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical law tracts, tract 3.</NOTE>: they have the free di&s;po&s;al during life; and even after death by naming an heir. The&s;e powers are &s;ufficient for accompli&s;hing e|very rational purpo&s;e: they are &s;ufficient for commerce, and they are &s;ufficient for benevo|lence. But the artificial wants of men are bound|le&s;s: not content with the full enjoyment of their property during life, nor with the pro&s;pect of its being enjoyed by a favourite heir, they are anxi|ou&s;ly bent to pre&s;erve it to them&s;elves for ever. A man who has ama&s;&s;ed a great e&s;tate in land, is mi&s;erable at the pro&s;pect of being obliged to quit his hold: to &s;ooth his di&s;ea&s;ed fancy, he makes a deed &s;ecuring it for ever to certain heirs; who mu&s;t without end bear his name, and pre|&s;erve his e&s;tate entire. Death, it is true, mu&s;t at la&s;t &s;eparate him from his idol: it is &s;ome con|&s;olation, however, that his will governs and gives law to every &s;ub&s;equent proprietor. How repugnant to the frail &s;tate of man, are &s;uch &s;wollen conceptions! Upon the&s;e however are founded entails, which have prevailed in many parts of the world, and unhappily at this day in|fe&s;t Scotland. Did entails produce no other harm but the gratification of a di&s;tempered appetite for property, they might be endured, though far
<PB N="280" REF="284">
from de&s;erving approbation: but, like other tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of nature and rea&s;on, they are pro|ductive of much mi&s;chief, not only to commerce, but to the very heirs for who&s;e benefit it is pre|tended that they are made.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that the law of nature has be&s;tow|ed on man, every power of property that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary either for commerce or for benevolence, how blind was it in the Engli&s;h legi&s;lature to add a mo&s;t irrational power, that of making an en|tail! But men will always be mending; and when a law-giver ventures to tamper with the laws of nature, he hazards much mi&s;chief. We have a pregnant in&s;tance above, of an attempt to mend the laws of God, in many ab&s;urd regu|lations for the poor; and that the law authori&s;ing entails, is another in&s;tance of the &s;ame kind, will be evident from what follows.</P>
<P>The mi&s;chievous effects of Engli&s;h entails were &s;oon di&s;covered: they occa&s;ioned &s;uch inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, that even the judges ventured to relieve the nations from them, by an artificial form, termed, <HI>fine and recovery.</HI> And yet, though no moderate man would de&s;ire more power over his e&s;tate than he has by common law, the legi|&s;lature of Scotland enabled every land-proprietor to fetter his e&s;tate for ever; to tyrannize over his heirs; and to reduce their property to a &s;ha|dow, by prohibiting alienation; and by prohi|biting the contracting debt, were it even to re|deem the proprietor from death or &s;lavery. Thus many a man, fonder of his e&s;tate than of his wife and children, grudges the u&s;e of it to his natural heirs, reducing them to the &s;tate of mere life-renters. Behold the con&s;equences. A num|ber of noblemen and gentlemen among us, lie in wait for every parcel of land that comes to market. Intent upon aggrandizing their family,
<PB N="281" REF="285">
or rather their e&s;tate, which is the favourite ob|ject, they &s;ecure every purcha&s;e by an entail; and the &s;ame cour&s;e will be followed, till no land be left to be purcha&s;ed. Thus every entailed e&s;tate in Scotland becomes in effect a mortmain, admitting additions without end, but ab&s;olutely barring any alienation; and if the legi&s;lature in|terpo&s;e not, the period is not di&s;tant, when all the land in Scotland will be locked up by entails, and withdrawn from commerce.</P>
<P>The purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent e&s;&s;ay, is to &s;et be|fore our legi&s;lature, coolly and impartially, the de&s;tructive effects of a Scotch entail. I am not &s;o &s;anguine as to hope, that men, who convert means into an end, and avariciou&s;ly covet land for its own &s;ake, will be prevailed upon to re|gard, either the intere&s;t of their country or of their po&s;terity: but I would gladly hope, that the legi&s;lature may be rou&s;ed to give attention to a national object of no &s;light importance.</P>
<P>I begin with effects of a private or dome&s;tic nature. To the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, an entail is a con&s;tant &s;ource of di&s;content, by &s;ubverting that liberty and independence, which all men covet, with re|&s;pect to their goods as well as their per&s;ons. What can be more vexatious to a proprietor of a great land-e&s;tate, than to be barred from the mo&s;t laudable acts, &s;uitable provi&s;ions for exam|ple to a wife or children? not to mentiom num|berle&s;s acts of benevolence, that endear indivi|duals to each other, and make &s;ociety comforta|ble. Were he ever &s;o indu&s;trious, his fields mu&s;t lie wa&s;te; for what man will lay out his own money upon an e&s;tate that is not his own? A great proportion of the land in Scotland is in &s;uch a &s;tate, that by laying out a thou&s;and pounds or &s;o, an intelligent proprietor may add a hundred pounds yearly to his rent-roll. But an entail ef|fectually
<PB N="282" REF="286">
bars that improvement: it affords the proprietor no credit; and &s;uppo&s;ing him to have the command of money independent of the e&s;tate, he will be ill-fated if he have not means to em|ploy it more profitably for his own intere&s;t. An entail, at the &s;ame time, is no better than a trap for an improvident po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: to avoid altogether the contracting debt, is impracticable; and if a young man be guided more by plea&s;ure than by prudence, which commonly is the ca&s;e of young men; a vigilant and rapacious &s;ub&s;titute, taking advantage of a forfeiting clau&s;e, turns him out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and delivers him over to want and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But an entail is productive of con&s;equences &s;till more di&s;mal, even with re&s;pect to heirs. A young man upon whom the family e&s;tate is en|tailed, without any power re&s;erved to the father, is not commonly ob&s;equious to advice, nor pati|ently &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the fatigues of education: he abandons him&s;elf to plea&s;ure, and indulges his pa&s;&s;ions without control. In one word, there is no &s;ituation more &s;ubver&s;ive of morals, than that of a young man, bred up from infancy in the certainty of inheriting an opulent fortune.</P>
<P>The condition of the other children, daughters e&s;pecially, is commonly deplorable. The pro|prietor of a large entailed e&s;tate, leaves at his death children who have acquired a ta&s;te for &s;umptuous living. The &s;ons drop off one by one, and a number of daughters remain, with a &s;canty provi&s;ion, or perhaps with none at all. A colla|teral male heir &s;ucceeds, who after a painful &s;earch is di&s;covered in &s;ome remote corner, qua|lified to procure bread by the &s;pade or the plough, but entirely unqualified for behaving as ma&s;ter of an opulent fortune. By &s;uch a metamorpho&s;is,
<PB N="283" REF="287">
the poor man makes a ludicrous figure; while the daughters, reduced to indigence, are in a &s;i|tuation much more lamentable than are the brats of beggars.</P>
<P>Our entails produce another dome&s;tic evil, for which no proper remedy is provided. The &s;ums permitted in mo&s;t entails to younger children, however adequate when the entail is made, be|come in time too &s;canty, by a fall in the value of money, and by increa&s;e of luxury; which is pe|culiarly hard upon daughters of great families: the provi&s;ions de&s;tined for them will not afford them bread; and they cannot hope to be &s;uitably matched, without a decent fortune. If we ad|here to entails, nunneries ought to be provided.</P>
<P>But the dome&s;tic evils of an entail make no figure compared with tho&s;e that re&s;pect the pub|lic. The&s;e in their full extent would fill a vo|lume: they are well known; and it may be &s;uf|ficient to keep them in view by &s;ome general hints.</P>
<P>As ob&s;erved above, few tenants in tail can command money for improvements, however profitable. Such di&s;couragement to agriculture, hurtful to proprietors of entailed e&s;tates, is &s;till more &s;o to the public. It is now an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, That a &s;tate is powerful in proportion to the product of its land: a nation that feeds its neighbours, can &s;tarve them. The quantity of land that is locked up in Scotland by entails, has damped the growing &s;pirit of agriculture. There is not produced &s;ufficiency of corn at home for our own con&s;umption: and our condition will be|come wor&s;e and wor&s;e by new entails, till agri|culture and indu&s;try be annihilated. Were the great entailed e&s;tates in Scotland, &s;plit into &s;mall properties of fifty or a hundred pounds yearly
<PB N="284" REF="288">
rent, we &s;hould &s;oon be enabled, not only to &s;up|ply our own markets, but to &s;pare for our neigh|bours.</P>
<P>In the next place, our entails are no le&s;s &s;ub|ver&s;ive of commerce than of agriculture. There are numberle&s;s land-e&s;tates in Scotland of one, two, or three hundred pounds yearly rent. Such an e&s;tate cannot afford bare nece&s;&s;aries to the pro|prietor, if he pretend to live like a gentleman. But he has an excellent re&s;ource: let him apply to any branch of trade, his e&s;tate will afford him credit for what money he wants. The profit he makes, pays the intere&s;t of the money borrowed, with a &s;urplus; and this &s;urplus, added to the rent of his e&s;tate, enables him to live comfort|ably. A number of land-proprietors in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, would advance commerce to a great height. But alas! there are not many who have that re&s;ource: &s;uch is the itch in Scoland for en|tailing, as even to de&s;cend lower than one hun|dred pounds yearly. Can one behold with pa|tience, the countenance that is given to &s;elfi&s;h wrong-headed people, acting in direct oppo&s;ition to the pro&s;perity of their country? Commerce is no le&s;s hurt in another re&s;pect: when our land is withdrawn from commerce by entails, every pro&s;perous trader will de&s;ert a country where he can find no land to purcha&s;e; for to rai&s;e a fami|ly by acquiring an e&s;tate in land, is the ultimate aim of every merchant, and of every man who accumulates money.</P>
<P>Thirdly, An entail is a bitter enemy to popu|lation. Population is generally proportioned to the number of land-proprietors. A very &s;mall portion of land, managed with &s;kill and indu&s;try, affords bread to a numerous family; and the great aim of the frugal proprietor, is to provide
<PB N="285" REF="289">
a fund for educating his children, and for e&s;tab|li&s;hing them in bu&s;ine&s;s. A numerous i&s;&s;ue, at the &s;ame time, is commonly the lot of the tem|perate and frugal; becau&s;e they are &s;trangers to luxury and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, which enervate the body, and dry up the &s;ources of procreation. This is no chimera or fond imagination: traver&s;e Europe; compare great capitals with di&s;tant provinces; and it will be found to hold univer|&s;ally, that children abound much more among the indu&s;trious poor, than among the luxurious rich. But if divi&s;ion of land into &s;mall properties, tend to population; depopulation mu&s;t be the nece&s;|&s;ary con&s;equence of an entail, the avowed intent of which is to unite many &s;mall properties in one great e&s;tate; and con&s;equently, to reduce land-proprietors to a &s;mall number.</P>
<P>Let us, in the fourth place, take under con&s;i|deration, the children of land-holders with re|&s;pect to education and indu&s;try; for unle&s;s men be u&s;efully employed, population is of no real advantage to a &s;tate. In that re&s;pect, great and &s;mall e&s;tates admit no compari&s;on. Children of great families, accu&s;tomed to affluence and luxu|ry, are too proud for bu&s;ine&s;s; and were they even willing, are incapable to drudge at a labo|rious employment. At the &s;ame time, as the father's hands are tied up by his entail from af|fording them means to &s;ub&s;i&s;t as per&s;ons of rank, they become a burden on the family, and on the &s;tate, and can do no &s;ervice to either, but by dy|ing. Yet there are men &s;o blind, or &s;o callous, as to be fond of entails. Let us try whether a more plea&s;ing &s;cene will have any effect upon them. Children of &s;mall land-holders, are from infancy educated in a frugal manner; and they mu&s;t be indu&s;trious, as they depend on indu&s;try
<PB N="286" REF="290">
for bread. Among that cla&s;s of men, education has its mo&s;t powerful influence; and upon that cla&s;s a nation chiefly relies, for its &s;kilful arti&s;ts and manufacturers, for its lawyers, phy&s;icians, divines, and even for its generals and &s;tate&s;men.</P>
<P>And this leads to con&s;ider, in the fifth place, the influence that great and &s;mall e&s;tates have on manners. Gentlemen of a moderate fortune, connected with their &s;uperiors and inferiors, im|prove &s;ociety, by &s;preading kindly affection through the whole members of the &s;tate. In &s;uch only re&s;ides the genuine &s;pirit of liberty, abhorrence equally of &s;ervility to &s;uperiors and of tyranny to inferiors. The nature of the Briti&s;h government, creates a mutual dependence of the great and &s;mall on each other. The great have favours to be&s;tow: the &s;mall have many more, by their privilege of electing parliament-men; which obliges men of high rank to affect popula|rity, if they have none at heart. This connec|tion produces good manners at lea&s;t between dif|ferent ranks, and perhaps &s;ome degree of cordia|lity. Accumulation of land into great e&s;tates, produces oppo&s;ite manners: when all the land in Scotland is &s;wallowed up by a number of gran|dees, and few gentlemen of the middle rank are left; even the appearance of popularity will va|ni&s;h, leaving pride and in&s;olence on the one hand, and abject &s;ervility on the other. In a word, the di&s;tribution of land into many &s;hares, accords charmingly with the free &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h con|&s;titution; but nothing is more repugnant to that &s;pirit, than overgrown e&s;tates in land.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixth place, Arts and &s;ciences can never flouri&s;h in a country, where all the land is en|gro&s;&s;ed by a few men. Science will never be cultivated by the di&s;pirited tenant, who can &s;carce
<PB N="287" REF="291">
procure bread; and &s;till le&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, by the in&s;olent landlord, who is too &s;elf-&s;ufficient for in|&s;truction. There will be no encouragement for arts: great and opulent proprietors, fo&s;tering am|bitious views, will cling to the &s;eat of govern|ment, which is far removed from Scotland; and if vanity make them &s;ometimes di&s;play their gran|deur at their country-&s;eats, they will be too deli|cate for any articles of luxury but what are fo|reign. The arts and &s;ciences being thus bani&s;h|ed, Scotland will be de&s;erted by every man of &s;pirit who can find bread el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>In the &s;eventh place, Such overgrown e&s;tates will produce an irregular and dangerous influence with re&s;pect to the Hou&s;e of Commons. The parliament-boroughs will be &s;ubdued by weight of money; and with re&s;pect to county-elections, it is a chance if there be left in a county as many land-holders capable to elect, and to be elected, as even to afford a choice. In &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces, will our con&s;titution be in no danger, from the ambitious views of men elevated above others by their va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions? Is it unlikely, that &s;uch men, taking advantage of public di&s;cord, will become an united body of ambitious oppre&s;|&s;ors, overawing their &s;overeign as well as their fellow-&s;ubjects? Such was the mi&s;erable condi|tion of Britain, while the &s;eudal oligarchy &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted: &s;uch at pre&s;ent is the mi&s;erable condition of Poland: and &s;uch will be the mi&s;erable condi|tion of Scotland, if the legi&s;lature afford not a remedy.</P>
<P>If the public intere&s;t only were to be regarded, the axe ought to be applied, cutting down en|tails to the very root: but a numberle&s;s body of &s;ub&s;titutes are intere&s;ted, many of whom would be di&s;inherited, if the tenants in tail had power.
<PB N="288" REF="292">
To reconcile as much as po&s;&s;ible the&s;e oppo&s;ite in|tere&s;ts, it is propo&s;ed, that the following articles be authori&s;ed by a &s;tatute. Fir&s;t, That the act of parliament 1685 be repealed with re&s;pect to all future operations. Second, That entails al|ready made and completed, &s;hall continue effec|tual to &s;uch &s;ub&s;titutes as exi&s;t at the date of the act propo&s;ed; but &s;hall not benefit any &s;ub&s;titute born after it. Third, That power be re&s;erved to every proprietor, after the act 1685 is at an end, to &s;ettle his e&s;tate upon what heirs he thinks proper, and to bar the&s;e heirs from altering the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; the&s;e powers being inherent in property at common law.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, the prohibiting entails will avail little, if tru&s;t-deeds be permitted in their utmo&s;t extent, as in England. And therefore, in order to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the law of nature with re|&s;pect to land property, a limitation of tru&s;t-deeds is nece&s;&s;ary. My propo&s;al is, That no tru&s;t-deed, directing or limiting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of heirs to a land-e&s;tate, &s;hall be effectual beyond the life of the heirs in exi&s;tence at the time.</P>

<HEAD>Government of ROYAL BOROUGHS in Scotland.</HEAD>
<P>BY a royal borough is in Scotland under&s;tood an incorporation that hold their lands of the crown, and are governed by magi&s;trates of their own naming. The admini&s;tration of the annual revenues of a royal borough, termed the <HI>common good,</HI> is tru&s;ted to the magi&s;trates; but not with|out control. It was originally &s;ubjected to the review of the Great Chamberlain; and accord|ingly the chap. 39. &sect; 45. of the <HI>Iter Camerarii,</HI> contains the following articles, recommended to the Chamberlain to be enquired into. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Giff there be an good a&s;&s;edation and uptaking of the common good of the burgh, and giff faith|ful compt be made thereof to the community of the burgh; and giff no compt is made, he whom and in quhaes hands it is come, and how it pa&s;&s;es by the community."</Q> In pur&s;u|ance of the&s;e in&s;tructions, the Chamberlain's precept for holding the ayr, or circuit, is direct|ed to the provo&s;t and bailies, enjoining them, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to call all tho&s;e who have received any of the town's revenues, or u&s;ed any office within the
<PB N="290" REF="294">
burgh, &s;ince the la&s;t chamberlain-ayr, to an|&s;wer &s;uch things as &s;hall be laid to their charge."</Q> <HI>Iter Camer. cap.</HI> 1. And in the third chapter, which contains the forms of the chamberlain-ayr, the fir&s;t thing to be done after fencing the court, is, to call the bailies and &s;erjeants to be challen|ged and accu&s;ed from the time of the la&s;t ayr.</P>
<P>This office, dangerous by exce&s;s of power, being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the royal boroughs were left in a &s;tate of anarchy. The magi&s;tracy, being now no longer under any check or control, was covet|ed by noblemen and gentlemen in the neighbour|hood; who, under the name of office-bearers, laid their hands on the revenues of the borough, and converted all to their own profit. This cor|ruption was heavily complained of in the reign of James V.; and a remedy was provided by act 26. parl. 1535, enacting, 1 &s;t, That none be qualified to be provo&s;t, bailie, or alderman, but an indwelling burge&s;s. 2dly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That no inha|bitant purcha&s;e lord&s;hip out of burgh, to the terror of his comburge&s;&s;es. And, 3dly, That all provo&s;ts, bailies, and aldermen of boroughs, bring yearly to the chequer at a day certain, the compt-books of their common good, to be &s;een and con&s;idered by the Lords Auditors, giff the &s;ame be &s;pended for the common well of the burgh, or not, under the penalty of lo&s;ing their freedom. And that the &s;aid pro|vo&s;ts, bailies, and aldermen, warn yearly, fifteen days before their coming to the che|quer, all tho&s;e who are willing to come for examining the &s;aid accounts, that they may impugn the &s;ame, in order that all murmur may cea&s;e in that behalf."</Q> And to enforce the&s;e regulations, a brieve was i&s;&s;ued from the chancery, commanding the magi&s;trates to pre&s;ent
<PB N="291" REF="295">
their accounts to the exchequer, and &s;ummoning the burge&s;&s;es to appear and object to the &s;ame.</P>
<P>A defect in this &s;tatute made it le&s;s effectual than it was intended to be. Magi&s;trates, to a|void the penalty, brought the count-books of their common good to the exchequer; but they brought no rental of the common good to found a charge again&s;t them. This defect was reme|died by act 28. parl. 1693, containing the follow|ing preamble. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the royal boroughs, by the male-admini&s;tration of their magi&s;trates, have fallen under great debts and burdens, to the diminution of their dignity, and the di&s;a|bling of them to &s;erve the crown and govern|ment as they ought; and that the care, over|&s;ight, and control of the common good of bo|roughs, belong to their Maje&s;ties by virtue of their prerogative-royal; therefore, for pre|venting the like abu&s;es and mi&s;applications in all time thereafter, their Maje&s;ties &s;tatute and ordain, That every burgh-royal, &s;hall, be|twixt this and the fir&s;t of November next, bring to the Lords of Trea&s;ury and Exchequer, an exact account of charge and di&s;charge, &s;ub|&s;cribed by the magi&s;trates and town-clerk, of their whole public-good and revenues, and of the whole debts and incumbrances that affect the &s;ame."</Q> This completed the remedy, by putting means into the hands of the Barons of Exchequer, to control the accounts enjoined by the former &s;tatute to be yearly given in.</P>
<P>The foregoing regulations are kept in ob&s;er|vance. Every year a precept i&s;&s;ues from the ex|chequer, &s;igned by one of the Barons, addre&s;&s;ed to the director of the chancery, requiring him to make out a brieve for every royal borough. The brieve is accordingly made out, returned to the
<PB N="292" REF="296">
exchequer, and &s;ent to the &s;everal &s;heriffs, to be &s;erved in all the royal boroughs within their bounds, as directed by the &s;tatute. The&s;e brieves are accordingly &s;o &s;erved by the &s;heriffs; and particularly it is a con&s;tant form in mo&s;t of the royal boroughs, to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation, fif|teen days before the day named for appearance in exchequer, warning the inhabitants to repair there, in order to object to the public accounts of the town: and further, in order to give them opportunity to frame objections, the book and accounts are laid open for the&s;e fifteen days, to be in&s;pected by all the inhabitants.</P>
<P>We learn from the records of exchequer, that from the year 1660 to the year 1683, accounts were regularly given in to exchequer, in obedi|ence to the &s;tatute. The town of Edinburgh on|ly having failed for &s;ome &s;hort time, Captain Thomas Hamilton merchant there, by an action in exchequer, compelled the magi&s;trates to pro|duce upon oath their trea&s;urer's accounts, which were accordingly audited. And we al&s;o learn, that from the Re&s;toration down to the Union, a clerk to the borough-roll was appointed by the crown, who&s;e proper bu&s;ine&s;s it was to examine and audite the accounts of the boroughs.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the foregoing &s;alutary regula|tions, and the form con&s;tantly practi&s;ed to make them effectual, the boroughs of late years have forborn to pre&s;ent their accounts in exchequer; hoping that they would be overlooked by the Engli&s;h court of exchequer, e&s;tabli&s;hed in Scot|land after the Union; which accordingly happen|ed. This neglect in the court of exchequer is greatly to be regretted, becau&s;e it reduces the royal boroughs, by the male-admini&s;tration of their magi&s;trates, to the &s;ame mi&s;erable condition
<PB N="293" REF="297">
that is &s;o loudly complained of in the &s;tatutes above mentioned. It is undoubtedly in the pow|er of the Barons to re&s;tore good government to the boroughs, by compelling the magi&s;trates to account yearly in the court of exchequer, accord|ing to the foregoing regulations. And to that end no more is nece&s;&s;ary, but to &s;ignify publicly that they are re&s;olved hereafter to put the&s;e re|gulations in execution.</P>
<P>How beneficial that &s;tep would be to this coun|try in general, and to the royal boroughs in par|ticular, will appear from con&s;idering, fir&s;t, the unhappy con&s;equences that re&s;ult from &s;uffering magi&s;trates to di&s;po&s;e of the town's revenues, without any check or control; and next the good effects that mu&s;t re&s;ult from a regular and care|ful management, under the in&s;pection of the King's judges.</P>
<P>The unhappy con&s;equences of leaving magi&s;|trates without any check or control, are too vi&s;ible to be di&s;gui&s;ed. The revenues of a royal bo|rough are &s;eldom laid out for the good of the town, but in making friends to the knot who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the magi&s;tracy; and in rioting and drunkenne&s;s, for which every pretext is laid hold of, particularly that of ho&s;pitality to &s;tran|gers. Such mi&s;management tends to idlene&s;s, and corruption of manners; which accordingly are remarkable in mo&s;t royal boroughs. Nor is the contagion confined within the town: it com|monly &s;preads all around.</P>
<P>Another con&s;equence, no le&s;s fatal, of leaving magi&s;trates to act without control, is a &s;trong de&s;ire in every licentious burge&s;s, of &s;tepping into the magi&s;tracy, for his own &s;ake, and for that of his friends. Hence the factions and animo&s;i|ties that prevail in almo&s;t all the royal boroughs;
<PB N="294" REF="298">
which are violently and indecently pur&s;ued, without the lea&s;t regard to the good of the com|munity.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t evil of all, re&s;pects the choice of their repre&s;entatives in parliament. A habit of riot and intemperance, makes them fit &s;ubjects to be corrupted, by every adventurer who is willing to lay out money for purcha&s;ing a &s;eat in parlia|ment. Hence the infamous practice of bribery at elections, which tends not only to corrupt the whole ma&s;s of the people, but, which is &s;till more dreadful, tends to fill the Hou&s;e of Com|mons with men of di&s;&s;olute manners, void of probity and honour.</P>
<P>But turning from &s;cenes &s;o di&s;mal, let us view the beautiful effects that re&s;ult, from an admini&s;|tration regularly carried on, as directed by the &s;tatutes above mentioned. The revenues of the royal boroughs are &s;uppo&s;ed to be above L. 40,000 yearly. And were this &s;um, or the half of it, prudently expended, for promoting arts and in|du&s;try among the numerous inhabitants of royal boroughs, the benefit, in a country &s;o narrow and poor as Scotland, would be immen&s;e: it would tend to population, it would greatly in|crea&s;e indu&s;try, manufactures, and commerce, be&s;ide augmenting the public revenue. In the next place, as there would be no temptation for de&s;igning men to convert the burden of magi&s;tra|cy into a benefit, faction and di&s;cord would va|ni&s;h; and there would be no le&s;s &s;olicitude to &s;hun the burden, than at pre&s;ent is &s;een to obtain it. None would &s;ubmit to the burden but the truly patriotic, men who would chearfully be&s;tow their time, and perhaps their money, upon the pub|lic; and who&s;e ambition it would be to acquire a
<PB N="295" REF="299">
character, by promoting indu&s;try, temperance, and hone&s;ty, among their fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>And when the government of the royal bo|roughs comes to be in &s;o good hands, bribery, which corrupts the very vitals of our con&s;titution, will be bani&s;hed of cour&s;e. And con&s;idering the proper and con&s;titutional dependence of the roy|al boroughs upon the king's judges, we may have rea&s;onable a&s;&s;urance, that few repre&s;entatives will be cho&s;en, but who are friends to their coun|try and to their &s;overeign.</P>

<HEAD>Plan for improving and pre&s;erving in order the HIGHWAYS in Scotland.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="preface">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HIghways have in Scotland become a capital ob|ject of police, by the increa&s;e of inland com|merce, upon which bad roads are a heavy tax. Hap|pily for our country, no per&s;on is ignorant of this truth; and we &s;ee with plea&s;ure the fruits of their conviction in various attempts, publick and private, to e&s;tabli&s;h this valuable branch of police upon the be&s;t footing. As this will be found no ea&s;y ta&s;k, it may rea&s;onably be hoped, that men of genius will &s;eriou&s;ly apply them&s;elves to it, and in general that every per&s;on will freely produce &s;uch hints as occur to them. In the latter view the following plan is offered to the public: and if, from the various pro|po&s;als that have been or &s;hall be publi&s;hed, an effec|tive plan can be framed, &s;uch as completely to an|&s;wer its purpo&s;e, it may &s;afely be pronounced, that it will produce more benefit to this country, than has been produced by any other &s;ingle improvement &s;ince the union of the two kingdoms.</P>

<P N="1">1. THE ju&s;tices of peace, commi&s;&s;ioners of &s;upply, the &s;heriff or &s;tewart depute, and the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of royal boroughs, &s;hall be commi&s;&s;ioners for making and repairing high|ways, bridges, and ferries, in the &s;everal &s;hires and &s;tewartries. All the powers given by law to the ju&s;tices of peace, and commi&s;&s;ioners of &s;up|ply, with re&s;pect to highways, bridges, and fer|ries, &s;hall be transferred to them; and any two &s;hall be a quorum, except where a greater num|ber is required by this act.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;heriff or &s;tewart depute &s;hall appoint the fir&s;t day of meeting of the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion|ers, as &s;oon as may conveniently be after the date of the act, by an intimation at each pari&s;h|church upon a Sunday at the clo&s;e of the fore|noon-&s;ervice. And the la&s;t Tue&s;day of March &s;hall yearly thereafter be a day of meeting at the head borough of the &s;hire or &s;tewartry, in place of the fir&s;t or third Tue&s;day of May appointed by former acts. The commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall ap|point a pre&s;es, convener, and clerk: and they &s;hall be impowered to adjourn them&s;elves from time to time.</P>
<P N="3">3. The commi&s;&s;ioners, at their fir&s;t meeting, &s;hall &s;et about a divi&s;ion of the &s;hire or &s;tewartry into two or more di&s;tricts, as they &s;ee convenient. And if they cannot overtake this work at that meeting, they &s;hall appoint proper per&s;ons to form a plan of the intended divi&s;ions, which plan &s;hall be reported to the commi&s;&s;ioners at their next meeting, in order to be approved or altered by them. This being &s;ettled, the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall appoint the heritors in the&s;e &s;everal di&s;tricts, or any three of them, to meet on a certain day and place, to make li&s;ts of the whole publick
<PB N="298" REF="302">
roads within their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, and to &s;ettle the order of reparation, beginning with tho&s;e that are the mo&s;t frequented. The pro|ceedings of the&s;e di&s;trict-meetings mu&s;t be re|ported to the commi&s;&s;ioners, at their next meet|ing; who are empowered to &s;ettle the order of reparation, in ca&s;e of variance among the heri|tors; and al&s;o to add any road that may have been omitted. And they &s;hall record a &s;cheme or plan of the whole roads in the &s;hire, thus en|li&s;ted, with their re&s;olutions thereupon, to be &s;een in the clerk's hands <HI>gratis.</HI> But upon any ju&s;t cau&s;e appearing in the cour&s;e of admini&s;tra|tion, the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall be empowered to alter or vary this plan, provided it be at a meeting previou&s;ly appointed for that purpo&s;e, and where three fifths at lea&s;t of the commi&s;&s;ioners are pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the &s;heriff or &s;tewart neglect to appoint the fir&s;t meeting of the commi&s;&s;ioners, he &s;hall incur a penalty of L. 100, upon a &s;ummary complaint to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion by any one he|ritor of the &s;hire; with co&s;ts of &s;uit, the one half to the plaintiff, and the other half to be ap|plied by the commi&s;&s;ioners for the purpo&s;es of this act.

<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS on the preceding PLAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE laws in Scotland relating to this branch of public police, are numerous; &s;ome en|acted while Scotland was a &s;eparate kingdom, &s;ome after its union with England. It is not the purpo&s;e of this paper to enter into a detail of the various regulations e&s;tabli&s;hed by the&s;e laws: they are generally known; and in the late abridgment of our &s;tatute-law, they are all recapitulated with brevity and preci&s;ion. It &s;hall &s;uffice cur&s;orily to ob&s;erve, that the acts made during the reign of Charles II. form the ground-work of our regulations concerning highways: the latter acts are little more than explanatory of the former.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to have been the plan of the legi&s;la|ture, that highways &s;hould be repaired by tho&s;e who are employed in hu&s;bandry; and ac|cordingly, the &s;ix days annual labour is, in the &s;tatutes of Charles II. impo&s;ed upon them only.</P>
<P>This was a mea&s;ure not ill &s;uited to the &s;tate of Scotland at that period. During the la&s;t century, we had little inland commerce to re|quire
<PB N="305" REF="309">
good roads, except that of corn carried to market; and for that rea&s;on, it was natural to impo&s;e upon hu&s;bandmen the burden of re|pairing highways. The&s;e per&s;ons, at the &s;ame time, pa&s;&s;ing the whole &s;ummer in idlene&s;s, unle&s;s when called to perform per&s;onal &s;ervices to capricious and unfeeling landlords, could not think it a hard&s;hip to have &s;ome part of their time employed in &s;erving them&s;elves in&s;tead of their landlords.</P>
<P>That annual labour upon highways, limited to a few days, &s;hould be required from men in that condition, appears not unju&s;t. And why may we not &s;uppo&s;e the legi&s;lature at that time capable of &s;uch enlarged views, as to prefer this method for repairing highways, in order to bring on gradually a habit of labour and indu|&s;try? But the condition of Scotland at pre|&s;ent differs widely from what it was in the reign of Charles II.; and the regulations for repairing highways which were then proper, have, by alteration of circum&s;tances, become both unju&s;t and inexpedient.</P>
<P>Unju&s;t they have become in a high degree. Inland commerce, which begins to flouri&s;h in Scotland, is greatly promoted by good roads; and every dealer, and indeed every traveller, profits by them. But no men are le&s;s intere&s;ted in good roads than day-labourers, or tho&s;e who are commonly called <HI>cottars;</HI> and yet the&s;e chiefly are burdened with the reparation. Such men, at the &s;ame time having commonly many children, find it difficult to &s;upport their fami|lies, even with their utmo&s;t indu&s;try. No|thing can be more unju&s;t, than to impo&s;e up|on &s;uch men an annual tax of &s;ix days labour for repairing roads, the goodne&s;s of which
<PB N="306" REF="310">
contributes little or nothing to their conveni|ence.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent laws are inexpedient, as well as unju&s;t. In the fir&s;t place, a tax of this na|ture di&s;courages the propagation of children, in which the &s;trength of a &s;tate con&s;i&s;ts: the poor labourer ought to be encouraged with a reward, in&s;tead of being di&s;couraged with a tax. In the next place, cottars called out to perform the &s;tatute-work, obey with reluct|ance, and trifle away time without doing any thing effectual. To enforce the law, and to compel &s;uch men to labour, is grievous to the gentlemen who are empowered to execute the law: they cannot puni&s;h with rigour or firm|ne&s;s, men who have &s;o good rea&s;on to decline the &s;ervice: they are &s;oon di&s;gu&s;ted with be|ing ta&s;kma&s;ters, and the generality de&s;i&s;t alto|gether.</P>
<P>Laws concerning private property are always kept in ob&s;ervance, and they execute them|&s;elves, as is commonly expre&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e there are always a multitude of individuals &s;trongly intere&s;ted to have them executed. But in making public laws, the great difficul|ty has ever been, to lay down effectual mea|&s;ures for putting them in execution; and by what means to make &s;uch laws execute them|&s;elves, is one of the mo&s;t intricate problems in politics. Our laws concerning highways, are eminently defective in that re&s;pect: and accordingly, though mo&s;t of them have exi&s;t|ed near a century, they never have at any pe|riod been executed to any extent. Take the following &s;pecimen, among many that may be urged, of this defect. Over&s;eers are forced into &s;ervice under a penalty, in order to com|pel
<PB N="307" REF="311">
the pea&s;ants to perform faithfully their &s;ix-days labour. To hope any good from a reluc|tant over&s;eer &s;et over a &s;et of reluctant labou|rers, is a fond conceit: it is much if his re|&s;entment tempt him not to encourage their idlene&s;s. In vain would we expect, that any over&s;eer, without a &s;uitable reward, will ex|ert him&s;elf in promoting the work.</P>
<P>To remedy the hard&s;hip of laying the bur|den of reparation upon tho&s;e who are lea&s;t+able and lea&s;t benefited, and at the &s;ame time to make this remedy effectual, is the purpo&s;e of the foregoing plan. And upon con&s;idering the matter in its different views, the only me|thod that promi&s;es &s;ucce&s;s, appears to be a county-tax laid upon land according to the va|luation, and a capitation-tax on the inha|bitants of boroughs. The&s;e taxes relieve the labouring poor, and lay the burden where it ought to be laid: and the law will execute it|&s;elf, if that effect can be hoped from any pub|lic law. Effectual mea&s;ures are laid down for levying the tax: and, if once levied, there is no danger of its being allowed to lie unem|ployed in the hands of the collector; for eve|ry heritor will be anxious to have &s;ome part employed for his benefit. The danger will rather be of factious di&s;putes about the di&s;tri|bution. This danger al&s;o is attempted to be prevented; and, it is hoped, with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Some narrow-minded per&s;ons may po&s;&s;ibly grudge a tax, that loads the pre&s;ent generation for the advantage of tho&s;e who come after: but is it rational to grudge, that others &s;hould benefit by mea&s;ures evidently calculated for advancing our own intere&s;t? Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that the heritors of a &s;hire were to concert
<PB N="308" REF="312">
mea&s;ures in common, for improving their lands: to make good roads would be one effec|tual mea&s;ure; for &s;uppo&s;ing the reparation to co&s;t L. 5000, their e&s;tates would be bettered double that &s;um.</P>
<P>To conclude: It is not to be expected that any regulations concerning highways, or con|cerning any branch of police, can be &s;o fram|ed as to plea&s;e every individual. Wi&s;e men are practicable men, to u&s;e an expre&s;&s;ion of Lord Bacon, and will make conce&s;&s;ions in or|der to promote a general good, if without &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions it cannot be obtained. Better far to have a good law, though in our opinion defective in &s;ome articles, than to have no law at all, or, which is wor&s;e, a law eminently de|fective, unju&s;t, and inexpedient.</P>
