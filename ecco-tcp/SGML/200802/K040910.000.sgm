<P>THAT the lea&s;t informed reader of this Speech may be enabled to enter fully into the &s;pirit of the tran&s;action on occa&s;ion of which it was delivered, it may be proper to acquaint him, that among the princes dependent on this nation in the &s;outhern part of In|dia, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable at pre&s;ent is commonly known by the title of the Nabob of Arcot.</P>
<P>This Prince owed the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his govern|ment, again&s;t the claims of his elder brother, as well as tho&s;e of other competitors, to the arms and influ|ence of the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t India Company. Being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed in a con&s;iderable part of the dominions he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, he began, about the year <HI>1765,</HI> to form, at the in&s;tigation (as he a&s;&s;erts) of the &s;ervants of the Ea&s;t India Company, a variety of de&s;igns for the further exten&s;ion of his territories. Some years after, he carried his views to certain objects of interior arrangement, of a very pernicious nature. None of the&s;e de&s;igns could be compa&s;&s;ed without the aid of the Company's arms; nor could tho&s;e arms be employed con&s;i&s;tently with an obedience to the Com|pany's orders. He was therefore advi&s;ed to form a more &s;ecret, but an equally powerful intere&s;t among the &s;ervants of that Company, and among others both at home and abroad. By engaging them in his inte|re&s;ts, the u&s;e of the Company's power might be ob|tained without their o&s;ten&s;ible authority; the power might even be employed in defiance of the authority, if
<PB N="vi" REF="3">
the ca&s;e &s;hould require, as in truth it often did require, a proceeding of that degree of boldne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Company had put him into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal great cities, and magnificent ca&s;tles. The good order of his affairs, his &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal dignity, his ideas of oriental &s;plendour, and the habits of an A&s;iatick life (to which, being a native of India, and a Ma|hometan, he had from his infancy been enured) would naturally have led him to fix the &s;eat of his govern|ment within his own dominions. In&s;tead of this, he totally &s;eque&s;tered him&s;elf from his country; and, aban|doning all appearance of &s;tate, he took up his re&s;idence in an ordinary hou&s;e, which he purcha&s;ed in the &s;uburbs of the Company's factory at Madras. In that place he has lived, without removing one day from thence, for &s;everal years pa&s;t. He has there continued a con|&s;tant cabal with the Company's &s;ervants, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t; creating, out of the ruins of the country, brilliant fortunes for tho&s;e who will, and en|tirely de&s;troying tho&s;e who will not, be &s;ub&s;ervient to his purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>An opinion prevailed, &s;trongly confirmed by &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in his own letters, as well as by a combination of circum&s;tances forming a body of evidence which can|not be re&s;i&s;ted, that very great &s;ums have been by him di&s;tributed, through a long cour&s;e of years, to &s;ome of the Company's &s;ervants. Be&s;ides the&s;e pre&s;umed payments in ready money (of which, from the nature of the thing, the direct proof is very difficult) debts have at &s;everal periods been acknowledged to tho&s;e gentlemen, to an immen&s;e amount; that is, to &s;ome millions of &s;ter|ling money. There is &s;trong rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that the body of the&s;e debts is wholly fictitious, and was never created by money <HI>bona fide</HI> lent. But even on a &s;up|po&s;ition that this va&s;t &s;um was really advanced, it was impo&s;&s;ible that the very reality of &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing tran&s;action &s;hould not cau&s;e &s;ome degree of alarm, and incite to &s;ome &s;ort of enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="4">It was not at all &s;eemly, at a moment when the Company it&s;elf was &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, as to require a &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion, by Act of Parliament, of the payment of bills drawn on them from India&mdash;and al&s;o a direct tax upon every hou&s;e in England, in order to facilitate the vent of their goods, and to avoid in&s;tant in&s;olvency&mdash;at that very moment that their &s;ervants &s;hould appear in &s;o flouri&s;hing a condition, as, be&s;ides ten million of other demands on their ma&s;ters, to be entitled to claim a debt of three or four millions more from the territorial revenue of one of their dependent princes.</P>
<P>The o&s;ten&s;ible pecuniary tran&s;actions of the Nabob of Arcot, with very private per&s;ons, are &s;o enormous, that they evidently &s;et a&s;ide every pretence of policy, which might induce a prudent government in &s;ome in|&s;tances to wink at ordinary loo&s;e practice in ill managed departments. No caution could be too great in han|dling this matter; no &s;crutiny too exact. It was evi|dently the intere&s;t, and as evidently at lea&s;t in the power, of the creditors, by admitting &s;ecret participa|tion in this dark and undefined concern, to &s;pread cor|ruption to the greate&s;t and the mo&s;t alarming extent.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts relative to the debts were &s;o notorious, the opinion of their being a principal &s;ource of the di&s;|orders of the Briti&s;h government in India was &s;o un|di&s;puted and univer&s;al, that there was no party, no de&s;cription of men in parliament, who did not think them&s;elves bound, if not in honour and con&s;cience, at lea&s;t in common decency, to in&s;titute a vigorous enquiry into the very bottom of the bu&s;ine&s;s, before they admitted any part of that va&s;t and &s;u&s;picious charge to be laid upon an exhau&s;ted country. Every plan concurred in directing &s;uch an enquiry; in order that whatever was di&s;covered to be corrupt, fraudulent, or oppre&s;&s;ive, &s;hould lead to a due animadver&s;ion on the offenders; and if any thing fair and equitable in its origin &s;hould be found (nobody &s;u&s;pected that much, comparatively &s;peaking, would be &s;o found) it might be provided for;
<PB N="viii" REF="5">
in due &s;ubordination, however, to the ea&s;e of the &s;ubject, and the &s;ervice of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the alledged grounds for an enquiry, &s;et|tled in all the bills brought into parliament relative to India, and there were I think no le&s;s than four of them. By the bill, commonly called Mr. Pitt's bill, the enquiry was &s;pecially, and by expre&s;s words, committed to the Court of Directors, without any re&s;erve for the inter|ference of any other per&s;on or per&s;ons what&s;oever. It was ordered that <HI>they</HI> &s;hould make the enquiry into the origin and ju&s;tice of the&s;e debts, as far as the materials in <HI>their</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion enabled them to proceed; and where <HI>they</HI> found tho&s;e materials deficient, <HI>they</HI> &s;hould order the Pre&s;idency of Fort St. George [Madras] to com|plete the enquiry.</P>
<P>The Court of Directors applied them&s;elves to the execution of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them. They fir&s;t examined into the amount of the debt, which they com|puted, at compound intere&s;t, to be &pound; <HI>2,945,600</HI> &s;terling. Whether their mode of computation, either of the ori|ginal &s;ums, or the amount on compound intere&s;t, was exact; that is, whether they took the intere&s;t too high, or the &s;everal capitals too low, is not material. On whatever principle any of the calculations were made up, none of them found the debt to differ from the re|cital of the act, which a&s;&s;erted, that the &s;ums claimed were "<HI>very</HI> large." The la&s;t head of the&s;e debts the Directors compute at &pound;. <HI>2,465,680</HI> &s;terling. Of the exi&s;tence of this debt the Directors heard nothing until <HI>1776,</HI> and they &s;ay, that,
<Q><HI>although they had</HI> repeat|edly <HI>written to the Nabob of Arcot, and to their &s;ervants, re&s;pecting the debt, yet they</HI> had never been able to trace the origin thereof, or to obtain any &s;atisfactory information on the &s;ub|ject.</Q></P>
<P>The Court of Directors, after &s;tating the circum|&s;tances under which the debts appeared to them to have been contracted, add as follows,
<Q>For the&s;e rea&s;ons
<PB N="ix" REF="6">
we &s;hould have thought it our duty to enquire <HI>very minutely</HI> into tho&s;e debts, even if the Act of Par|liament had been &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, before we concurred in any mea&s;ure for their payment. But with the po&s;itive injunctions of the Act before us, to examine into their nature and origin, we are in|di&s;pen&s;ably bound to direct &s;uch an enquiry to be in|&s;tituted.</Q>
They then order the Pre&s;ident and Coun|cil of Madras to enter into a full examination, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Directors having drawn up their order to the Pre|&s;idency on the&s;e principles, communicated the draught of the general letter in which tho&s;e orders were contain|ed, to the Board of his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, and other &s;ervants, lately con&s;tituted by Mr. Pitt's Ea&s;t India Act. The&s;e Mini&s;ters who had ju&s;t carried through Par|liament the Bill ordering a &s;pecific enquiry, immediately drew up another letter, on a principle directly oppo&s;ite to that, which was pre&s;cribed by the Act of Parliament, and followed by the Directors. In the&s;e &s;econd orders, all idea of an enquiry into the ju&s;tice and origin of the pretended debts, particularly of the la&s;t, the greate&s;t, and the mo&s;t obnoxious to &s;u&s;picion, is aban|doned. They are all admitted and e&s;tabli&s;hed with|out any inve&s;tigation what&s;oever; except &s;ome private conference with the agents of the claimants is to pa&s;s for an inve&s;tigation; and a fund for their di&s;charge is a&s;&s;igned and &s;et apart out of the revenues of the Carnatic.&mdash;To this arrangement in favour of their &s;ervants, &s;ervants &s;u&s;pected of corruption, and con|victed of di&s;obedience, the Directors of the Ea&s;t India Company were ordered to &s;et their hands, a&s;&s;erting it to ari&s;e from their own conviction and opinion, in flat contradiction to their recorded &s;entiments, their &s;trong remon&s;trance, and their declared &s;en&s;e of their duty, as well under their general tru&s;t and their oath as Directors, as under the expre&s;s injunctions of an Act of Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="7">The principles upon which this &s;ummary proceed|ing was adopted by the Mini&s;terial Board, are &s;tated by them&s;elves in a number in the Appendix to this Speech.</P>
<P>By another &s;ection of the &s;ame Act, the &s;ame Court of Directors were ordered to take into con&s;ideration and to decide on the indeterminate rights of the Rajah of Tanjore and the Nabob of Arcot; and in this, as in the former ca&s;e, no power of appeal, revi&s;ion, or alteration was re&s;erved to any other. It was a juri&s;|diction, in a cau&s;e between party and party, given to the Court of Directors &s;pecifically. It was known, that the territories of the former of the&s;e princes had been twice invaded and pillaged, and the prince de|po&s;ed and impri&s;oned, by the Company's &s;ervants, in|fluenced by the intrigues of the latter, and for the purpo&s;e of paying his pretended debts. The Company had, in the year <HI>1775,</HI> ordered a re&s;toration of the Rajah to his government, under certain conditions. The Rajah complained that his territories had not been completely re&s;tored to him; and that no part of his goods, money, revenues, or records, unju&s;tly taken and with-held from him, were ever returned. The Nabob, on the other hand, never cea&s;ed to claim the country it&s;elf, and carried on a continued train of negociation, that it &s;hould again be given up to him, in violation of the Company's public faith.</P>
<P>The Directors, in obedience to this part of the Act, ordered an enquiry, and came to a determination to re&s;tore certain of his territories to the Rajah. The Mini&s;ters proceeding as in the former ca&s;e, without hearing any party, re&s;cinded the deci&s;ion of the Di|rectors, refu&s;ed the re&s;titution of the territory, and without regard to the condition of the country of Tanjore, which had been within a few years four times plundered (twice by the Nabob of Arcot, and twice by enemies brought upon it &s;olely by the politics of the &s;ame Nabob, the declared enemy of that people)
<PB N="xi" REF="8">
and without di&s;counting a &s;hilling for their &s;ufferings, they accumulate an arrear of about <HI>400,000</HI> pounds of pretended tribute to this enemy; and then they order the Directors to put their hands to a new ad|judication, directly contrary to a judgment, in a ju|dicial character and tru&s;t, &s;olemnly given by them, and entered on their records.</P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings naturally called for &s;ome enquiry. On the <HI>28</HI>th of February, <HI>1785,</HI> Mr. Fox made the following motion in the Hou&s;e of Commons, after moving that the clau&s;es of the Act &s;hould be read&mdash;
<Q>That the proper officer do lay before this Hou&s;e copies and extracts of all letters and orders of the Court of Directors of the United Ea&s;t India Compa|ny, in pur&s;uance of the injunctions contained in the <HI>37</HI>th and <HI>38</HI>th clau&s;es of the &s;aid Act; and the que&s;tion being put, it pa&s;&s;ed in the negative by a very great majority.</Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;peech in the debate was the following; which is given to the public, not as being more wor|thy of its attention than others (&s;ome of which were of con&s;ummate ability) but as entering more into the detail of the &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE times we live in, Mr. Speaker, have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by extraordinary events. Ha|bituated, however, as we are, to uncommon com|binations of men and of affairs, I believe nobody recollects any thing more &s;urpri&s;ing than the &s;pec|tacle of this day. The right honourable gentle|man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Right honourable Henry Dundas.</NOTE>, who&s;e conduct is now in que&s;tion, formerly &s;tood forth in this hou&s;e, the pro&s;ecutor of the worthy baronet <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Thomas Rumbold, late governor of Madras.</NOTE> who &s;poke after him. He charged him with &s;everal grievous acts of mal|ver&s;ation in office; with abu&s;es of a public tru&s;t of a great and heinous nature. In le&s;s than two years we &s;ee the &s;ituation of the parties rever&s;ed; and a &s;ingular revolution puts the worthy baro|net in a fair way of returning the pro&s;ecution in a recriminatory bill of Pains and Penalties, grounded on a breach of public tru&s;t, relative to the go|vernment of the very &s;ame part of India. If he &s;hould undertake a bill of that kind, he will find no difficulty in conducting it with a degree of &s;kill and vigour fully equal to all that have been ex|erted again&s;t him.</P>
<P>But the change of relation between the&s;e two gentlemen is not &s;o &s;triking as the total difference
<PB N="2" REF="10">
of their deportment under the &s;ame unhappy cir|cum&s;tances. Whatever the merits of the worthy baronet's defence might have been, he did not &s;hrink from the charge. He met it with man|line&s;s of &s;pirit, and decency of behaviour. What would have been thought of him, if he had held the pre&s;ent language of his old accu&s;er? When ar|ticles were exhibited again&s;t him by that right honourable gentleman, he did not think proper to tell the Hou&s;e that we ought to in&s;titute no en|quiry, to in&s;pect no paper, to examine no witne&s;s. He did not tell us (what at that time he might have told us with &s;ome &s;hew of rea&s;on) that our concerns in India were matters of delicacy; that to divulge any thing relative to them would be mi&s;chievous to the &s;tate. He did not tell us, that tho&s;e who would enquire into his proceedings were di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;member the empire. He had not the pre&s;umption to &s;ay, that for his part, having ob|tained in his Indian pre&s;idency, the ultimate object of his ambition, his honour was concerned in executing with integrity the tru&s;t which had been legally committed to his charge. That others, not having been &s;o fortunate, could not be &s;o di&s;in|tere&s;ted; and therefore their accu&s;ations could &s;pring from no other &s;ource than faction, and envy to his fortune.</P>
<P>Had he been frontle&s;s enough to hold &s;uch vain vapouring language in the face of a grave, a de|tailed, a &s;pecified matter of accu&s;ation, whil&s;t he violently re&s;i&s;ted every thing which could bring the merits of his cau&s;e to the te&s;t; had he been wild enough to anticipate the ab&s;urdities of this day; that is, had he inferred, as his late accu&s;er has thought proper to do, that he could not have been guilty of malver&s;ation in office, for this &s;ole and curious rea&s;on, that he had been in office; had he argued the impo&s;&s;ibility of his abu&s;ing his power on this
<PB N="3" REF="11">
&s;ole principle, that he had power to abu&s;e, he would have left but one impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of every man who heard him, and who believed him in his &s;en&s;es&mdash;that in the utmo&s;t extent he was guilty of the charge.</P>
<P>But, Sir, leaving the&s;e two gentlemen to alter|nate, as criminal and accu&s;er, upon what principles they think expedient; it is for us to con&s;ider, Whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Trea&s;urer of the Navy, acting as a Board of Control, are ju&s;tified by law or policy, in &s;u&s;|pending the legal arrangements made by the Court of Directors, in order to transfer the pub|lic revenues to the private emolument of certain &s;ervants of the Ea&s;t India Company, without the enquiry into the origin and ju&s;tice of their claims, pre&s;cribed by an act of Parliament?</P>
<P>It is not contended, that the act of parliament did not expre&s;sly ordain an enquiry. It is not a&s;|&s;erted that this enquiry was not, with equal pre|ci&s;ion of terms, &s;pecially committed under particular regulations to the Court of Directors. I conceive, therefore, the Board of Control had no right what|&s;oever to intermeddle in that bu&s;ine&s;s. There is nothing certain in the principles of juri&s;prudence, if this be not undeniably true, that when a &s;pecial authority is given to any per&s;ons by name, to do &s;ome particular act, that no others, by virtue of general powers, can obtain a legal title to intrude them&s;elves into that tru&s;t, and to exerci&s;e tho&s;e &s;pecial functions in their place. I therefore con&s;ider the intermeddling of mini&s;ters in this affair as a downright u&s;urpation. But if the &s;trained con|&s;truction, by which they have forced them&s;elves into a &s;u&s;picious office (which every man, delicate with regard to character, would rather have &s;ought con&s;tructions to avoid) were perfectly &s;ound and per|fectly legal, of this I am certain, that they cannot be
<PB N="4" REF="12">
ju&s;tified in declining the enquiry which had been pre&s;cribed to the Court of Directors. If the Board of Control did lawfully po&s;&s;e&s;s the right of executing the &s;pecial tru&s;t given to that court, they mu&s;t take it as they found it, &s;ubject to the very &s;ame regu|lations which bound the Court of Directors. It will be allowed that the Court of Directors had no au|thority to di&s;pense with either the &s;ub&s;tance, or the mode of enquiry pre&s;cribed by the act of parliament. If they had not, where, in the act, did the Board of Control acquire that capacity? Indeed, it was im|po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould acquire it.&mdash;What mu&s;t we think of the fabric and texture of an act of par|liament which &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;cribe a &s;trict inqui&s;ition; that &s;hould de&s;cend into minute re|gulations for the conduct of that inqui&s;ition; that &s;hould commit this tru&s;t to a particular de&s;cription of men, and in the very &s;ame breath &s;hould enable an|other body, at their own plea&s;ure, to &s;uperfede all the provi&s;ions the legi&s;lature had made, and to defeat the whole purpo&s;e, end, and object of the law? This cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed even of an act of parliament conceived by the Mini&s;ters them&s;elves, and brought forth during the delirium of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>My honourable friend has told you in the &s;peech which introduced his motion, that fortunately this que&s;tion is not a great deal involved in the laby|rinths of Indian detail. Certainly not. But if it were, I beg leave to a&s;&s;ure you, that there is nothing in the Indian detail which is more difficult than in the detail of any other bu&s;ine&s;s. I admit, becau&s;e I have &s;ome experience of the fact, that for the in|terior regulation of India, a minute knowledge of India is requi&s;ite. But on any &s;pecific matter of delinquency in its government, you are as capable of judging, as if the &s;ame thing were done at your door. Fraud, inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion, peculation, en|gendered in India, are crimes of the &s;ame blood,
<PB N="5" REF="13">
family, and ca&s;t, with tho&s;e that are born and bred in England. To go no farther than the ca&s;e before us; you are ju&s;t as competent to judge whether the &s;um of four millions &s;terling ought, or ought not, to be pa&s;&s;ed from the public trea&s;ury into a private pocket, without any title except the claim of the parties, when the i&s;&s;ue of fact is laid in Madras, as when it is laid in We&s;tmin&s;ter. Terms of art, indeed, are different in different places; but they are gene|rally under&s;tood in none. The technical &s;tyle of an Indian trea&s;ury, is not one jot more remote than the jargon of our own exchequer, from the train of our ordinary ideas, or the idiom of our common lan|guage. The difference therefore in the two ca&s;es, is not in the comparative difficulty or facility of the two &s;ubjects, but in our attention to the one, and our total neglect of the other. Had this attention and neglect been regulated by the value of the &s;e|veral objects, there would be nothing to complain of. But the rever&s;e of that &s;uppo&s;ition is true. The &s;cene of the Indian abu&s;e is di&s;tant indeed; but we mu&s;t not infer, that the value of our intere&s;t in it is decrea&s;ed in proportion as it recedes from our view. In our politics, as in our common con|duct, we &s;hall be wor&s;e than infants, if we do not put our &s;en&s;es under the tuition of our judgment, and effectually cure our&s;elves of that optical illu&s;ion, which makes a briar at our no&s;e of greater magni|tude, than an oak at five hundred yards di&s;tance.</P>
<P>I think I can trace all the calamities of this coun|try to the &s;ingle &s;ource of our not having had &s;tea|dily before our eyes a general, comprehen&s;ive, well-connected, and well-proportioned view of the whole of our dominions, and a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their true bearings and relations. After all its reductions, the Briti&s;h empire is &s;till va&s;t and various. After all the reductions of the Hou&s;e of Commons, (&s;tripped as we are of our brighte&s;t ornaments, and
<PB N="6" REF="14">
of our mo&s;t important privileges) enough are yet left to furni&s;h us, if we plea&s;e, with means of &s;hew|ing to the world, that we de&s;erve the &s;uperintend|ance of as large an empire as this kingdom ever held, and the continuance of as ample privileges as the Hou&s;e of Commons, in the plenitude of its power, had been habituated to a&s;&s;ert. But if we make our&s;elves too little for the &s;phere of our duty; if, on the contrary, we do not &s;tretch and expand our minds to the compa&s;s of their object, be well a&s;&s;ured, that every thing about us will dwindle by degrees, until at length our concerns are &s;hrunk to the dimen&s;ions of our minds. It is not a predilection to mean, &s;ordid, home-bred cares, that will avert the con&s;equences of a fal&s;e e&s;timation of our intere&s;t, or prevent the &s;hameful dilapidation into which a great empire mu&s;t fall, by mean reparations upon mighty ruins.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I feel a degree of di&s;gu&s;t, almo&s;t lead|ing to de&s;pair, at the manner in which we are act|ing in the great exigencies of our country. There is now a bill in this hou&s;e, appointing a rigid inqui|&s;ition into the minute&s;t detail of our offices at home. The collection of &s;ixteen millions annu|ally; a collection on which the public greatne&s;s, &s;afety, and credit have their reliance; the whole order of criminal juri&s;prudence, which holds toge|ther &s;ociety it&s;elf, have at no time obliged us to call forth &s;uch powers; no, nor any thing like them. There is not a principle of the law and con&s;titution of this country that is not &s;ubverted to favour the execution of that project <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, N^o 1.</NOTE>.

them&s;elves, not on what is mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to his affairs, but on what is neare&s;t to his ken. Great difficulties have given a ju&s;t value to oeconomy; and our mini&s;ter of the day mu&s;t be an oeconomi&s;t, whatever it may co&s;t us. But where is he to exert his talents? At home to be &s;ure; for where el&s;e can he obtain a profitable credit for their exertion? It is nothing to him, whether the object on which he works under our eye be promi&s;ing or not. If he does not obtain any public benefit, he may make regulations without end. Tho&s;e are &s;ure to pay in pre&s;ent expectation, whil&s;t the effect is at a di&s;tance, and may be the concern of other times, and other men. On the&s;e principles he choo&s;es to &s;uppo&s;e (for he does not pretend more than to &s;uppo&s;e) a naked po&s;&s;ibility, that he &s;hall draw &s;ome re&s;ource out of crumbs dropped from the trenchers of penury; that &s;omething &s;hall be laid in &s;tore from the &s;hort allowance of revenue officers, overloaded with duty, and fami&s;hed for want of bread; by a reduction from officers who are at this very hour ready to batter the trea&s;ury with what breaks through &s;tone walls, for an <HI>increa&s;e</HI> of their appointments. From the marrowle&s;s bones of the&s;e &s;keleton e&s;tabli&s;hments, by the u&s;e of every &s;ort of cutting, and of every &s;ort of fretting tool, he flatters him&s;elf that he may chip and ra&s;p an empirical alimentary powder, to diet into &s;ome &s;imilitude of health and &s;ub&s;tance the langui&s;hing chimeras of fraudulent reformation.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he is thus employed according to his po|licy and to his ta&s;te, he has not lei&s;ure to enquire into tho&s;e abu&s;es in India that are drawing off mo|ney by millions from the trea&s;ures of this country, which are exhau&s;ting the vital juices from mem|bers of the &s;tate, where the public inanition is far more &s;orely felt than in the local exchequer of England.

<P>Actuated by the &s;ame principle of choice, he has now on the anvil another &s;cheme, full of dif|ficulty and de&s;perate hazard, which totally alters the commercial relation of two kingdoms; and what end &s;oever it &s;hall have, may bequeath a legacy of heart-burning and di&s;content to one of the countries, perhaps to both, to be perpetuated to the late&s;t po&s;terity. This project is al&s;o under|taken on the hope of profit. It is provided, that out of &s;ome (I know not what) remains of the Iri&s;h hereditary revenue, a fund at &s;ome time, and of &s;ome &s;ort, &s;hould be applied to the protection of the Iri&s;h trade.

But whil&s;t we look with pain at his de&s;perate and laborious trifling; whil&s;t we are apprehen&s;ive that he will break his back in &s;tooping to pick up chaff and &s;traws, he recovers him&s;elf at an ela&s;tic bound, and with a broad-ca&s;t &s;wing of his arm, he &s;quanders over his Indian field a &s;um far greater than the clear pro|duce of the whole hereditary revenue of the king|dom of Ireland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole of the net Iri&s;h hereditary revenue is, on a medium of the la&s;t &s;even years, about &pound; 330,000 yearly.

The greate&s;t body of your revenue, your mo&s;t nume|rous armies, your mo&s;t important commerce, the riche&s;t &s;ources of your public credit, (contrary to every idea of the known &s;ettled policy of Eng|land) are on the point of being converted into a my&s;tery of &s;tate. You are going to have one half of the globe hid even from the common liberal curio&s;ity of an Engli&s;h gentleman. Here a grand revolution commences. Mark the period, and mark the circum&s;tances. In mo&s;t of the capital changes that are recorded in the principles and &s;y&s;tem of any government, a public benefit of &s;ome kind or other has been pretended. The re|volution commenced in &s;omething plau&s;ible; in &s;omething which carried the appearance at lea&s;t of puni&s;hment of delinquency, or correction of abu&s;e. But here, in the very moment of the conver&s;ion of a department of Briti&s;h government into an Indian my&s;tery, and in the very act in which the change commences, a corrupt, private intere&s;t is &s;et up in direct oppo&s;ition to the nece&s;|&s;ities of the nation.

<P>Madras, with its dependencies, is the &s;econd (but with a long interval, the &s;econd) member of the Briti&s;h empire in the Ea&s;t. The trade of that city, and of the adjacent territory, was, not very long ago, among the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing in A&s;ia. But &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Briti&s;h power, it has wa&s;ted away under an uniform gradual de|cline; in&s;omuch that in the year 1779 not one mer|chant of eminence was to be found in the whole country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Smith's examination before the Select Committee, Appendix N^o 2.</NOTE>.

If we &s;ix the commencement of this extraction of money from the Carnatic at a period no earlier than the year 1760, and clo&s;e it in the year 1780, it probably will not amount to a great deal le&s;s than twenty millions of money.</P>
<P>During the deep &s;ilent flow of this &s;teady &s;tream of wealth, which &s;et from India into Europe, it

generally pa&s;&s;ed on with no adequate ob&s;ervation; but happening at &s;ome periods to meet rifts of rocks that checked its cour&s;e, it grew more noi&s;y, and attracted more notice. The pecuniary di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions cau&s;ed by an accumulation of part of the for|tunes of their &s;ervants in a debt from the Nabob of Arcot, was the fir&s;t thing which very particularly called for, and long engaged, the attention of the Court of Directors. This debt amounted to eight hundred and eighty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, and was claimed, for the greater part, by Engli&s;h gen|tlemen, re&s;iding at Madras. This grand capital, &s;ettled at length by order, at ten <HI>per cent.</HI> af|forded an annuity of eighty-eight thou&s;and pounds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fourth Report, Mr. Dundas's Committee, p. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Directors were dige&s;ting their a&s;to|ni&s;hment at this information, a memorial was pre|&s;ented to them from three gentlemen, informing them that their friends had lent likewi&s;e, to mer|chants of Canton in China, a &s;um of not more than one million &s;terling. In this memorial they called upon the Company for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance and interpo&s;ition with the Chine&s;e government for the recovery of the debt. This &s;um lent to Chine&s;e merchants, was at 24 <HI>per cent.</HI> which would yield, if paid, an annuity of two hundred and forty thou|&s;and pounds <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A witne&s;s examined before the Committee of Secrecy &s;ays, that eighteen <HI>per Cent.</HI> was the u&s;ual intere&s;t; but he had heard that more had been given.

<P>Perplexed as the Directors were with the&s;e de|mands, you may conceive, Sir, that they did not find them&s;elves very much di&s;embarra&s;&s;ed, by being made acquainted that they mu&s;t again exert their influence for a new re&s;erve of the happy par&s;imony of their &s;ervants, collected into a &s;econd debt from
<PB N="13" REF="21">
the Nabob of Arcot, amounting to two millions four hundred thou&s;and pounds, &s;ettled at an inte|re&s;t of 12 <HI>per cent.</HI> This is known by the name of the Con&s;olidation of 1777, as the former of the Nabob's debts was by the title of the Con&s;olidation of 1767. To this was added, in a &s;eparate parcel, a little re&s;erve called the Cavalry Debt, of one hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, at the &s;ame intere&s;t. The whole of the&s;e four capitals, amounting to four millions four hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds, produced at their &s;everal rates, an|nuities amounting to &s;ix hundred and twenty-three thou&s;and pounds a year; a good deal more than one third of the clear land-tax of England, at four &s;hillings in the pound; a good deal more than double the whole annual dividend of the Ea&s;t India Company, the nominal ma&s;ters to the proprietors in the&s;e funds. Of this intere&s;t, three hundred and eighty-three thou&s;and two hundred pound a year &s;tood chargeable on the public revenues of the Carnatic.</P>
<P>Sir, at this moment, it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the various operations which the capital and intere&s;t of this debt have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively undergone. I &s;hall &s;peak to the&s;e operations when I come par|ticularly to an&s;wer the right honourable gentleman on each of the heads, as he has thought proper to di|vide them. But this was the exact view in which the&s;e debts fir&s;t appeared to the Court of Directors, and to the world. It varied afterwards. But it never appeared in any other than a mo&s;t que&s;tionable &s;hape. When this gigantic phantom of debt fir&s;t appeared before a young mini&s;ter, it naturally would have ju&s;tified &s;ome degree of doubt and apprehen&s;ion. Such a prodigy would have filled any common man with &s;uper&s;titious fears. He would exorci&s;e that &s;hapele&s;s, namele&s;s form, and by every thing &s;acred would have adjured it to tell by what means

a &s;mall number of &s;light individuals, of no con|&s;equence or &s;ituation, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no lucrative offices, without the command of armies, or the known admini&s;tration of revenues, without pro|fe&s;&s;ion of any kind, without any &s;ort of trade &s;uffi|cient to employ a pedlar, could have, in a few years (as to &s;ome even in a few months) have ama&s;&s;ed trea&s;ures equal to the revenues of a re|&s;pectable kingdom? Was it not enough to put the&s;e gentlemen, in the noviciate of their admini&s;|tration, on their guard, and to call upon them for a &s;trict enquiry (if not to ju&s;tify them in a re|probation of tho&s;e demands without any enquiry at all) that when all England, Scotland, and Ireland, had for years been witne&s;s to the immen&s;e &s;ums laid out by the &s;ervants of the Company in &s;tocks of all denominations, in the purcha&s;e of lands, in the buy|ing and building of hou&s;es, in the &s;ecuring quiet &s;eats in parliament, or in the tumultuous riot of conte&s;ted elections, in wandering throughout the whole range of tho&s;e variegated modes of inventive prodigality; which &s;ometimes have excited our wonder, &s;ometimes rou&s;ed our indignation; that after all India was four millions &s;till in debt to <HI>them?</HI> India in debt to <HI>them!</HI> For what? Every debt for which an equivalent of &s;ome kind or other is not given, is on the face of it a fraud. What is the equivalent they have given? What equivalent had they to give? What are the articles of com|merce, or the branches of manufacture which tho&s;e gentlemen have carried hence to enrich India? What are the &s;ciences they beamed out to en|lighten it? What are the arts they introduced to chear and to adorn it? What are the religious, what the moral in&s;titutions they have taught among that people as a guide to life, or as a con&s;olation when life is to be no more, that there is an eternal debt, a debt "&s;till paying, &s;till to owe," which mu&s;t

<P>In my opinion the courage of the mini&s;ter was the mo&s;t wonderful part of the tran&s;action, e&s;pe|cially as he mu&s;t have read, or rather the right ho|nourable gentleman &s;ays, he has read for him, whole volumes upon the &s;ubject. The volumes, by the way, are not by one tenth part &s;o numerous as the right honourable, gentleman has thought proper to pretend, in order to frighten you from enquiry; but in the&s;e volumes, &s;uch as they are, the mini&s;ter mu&s;t have found a full authority for a &s;u&s;picion (at the very lea&s;t) of every thing relative to the great fortunes made at Madras. What is that authority? Why no other than the &s;tanding authority for all the claims which the Mini&s;try has thought fit to provide for&mdash;the grand debtor&mdash; the Nabob of Arcot him&s;elf. Hear that Prince, in the letter written to the Court of Directors, at the preci&s;e period, whil&s;t the main body of the&s;e debts were contracting. In his Letter he &s;tates him&s;elf to be, what undoubtedly he is, a mo&s;t competent witne&s;s to this point. After &s;peaking of the war with Hyder Ali in 1768 and 1769, and of other mea&s;ures which he cen&s;ures (whether right or wrong it &s;ignifies nothing) and into which he &s;ays he had been led by the Company's &s;ervants; he proceeds in this manner&mdash;
<Q><HI>If all the&s;e things were again&s;t the real intere&s;ts of the Company, they are ten thou&s;and times more again&s;t mine, and again&s;t the pro&s;perity of my country, and the happine&s;s of my people; for your intere&s;ts and mine are the &s;ame.</HI> What were they owing to then? to the private views of a few individuals, who have

enriched them&s;elves at the expence of your influence, and of my country; for your &s;ervants HAVE NO TRADE IN THIS COUNTRY; neither do you pay them high wages, yet in a few years they return to England, with many lacks of pagodas. How can you or I account for &s;uch immen&s;e fortunes, acquired in &s;o &s;hort a time, without any vi&s;ible means of getting them?</Q></P>
<P>When he a&s;ked this que&s;tion, which involves its an&s;wer, it is extraordinary that curio&s;ity did not prompt the Chancellor of the Exchequer to that enquiry which might come in vain recom|mended to him by his own act of parliament. Does not the Nabob of Arcot tell us in &s;o many words, that there was no fair way of making the enormous &s;ums &s;ent by the Company's &s;ervants to England? and do you imagine that there was or could be more hone&s;ty and good faith in the de|mands, for what remained behind in India? Of what nature were the tran&s;actions with him&s;elf? If you follow the train of his information you mu&s;t &s;ee, that if the&s;e great &s;ums were at all lent, it was not property, but &s;poil that was lent; if not lent, the tran&s;action was not a contract, but a fraud. Either way, if light enough could not be furni&s;hed to authori&s;e a full condemnation of the&s;e demands, they ought to have been left to the parties who be&s;t knew and under&s;tood each others proceedings. It was not nece&s;&s;ary that the authority of government &s;hould interpo&s;e in favour of claims, who&s;e very foundation was a defiance of that authority, and who&s;e object and end was its entire &s;ubver&s;ion.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid that this letter was written by the Nabob of Arcot in a moody humour, under the influence of &s;ome chagrin. Certainly it was; but it is in &s;uch humours that truth comes out. And when he tells you from his own knowledge, what every one mu&s;t pre&s;ume, from the extreme
<PB N="17" REF="25">
probability of the thing, whether he told it or not, one &s;uch te&s;timony is worth a thou&s;and that contradict that probability, when the parties have a better under&s;tanding with each other, and when they have a point to carry, that may unite them in a common deceit.</P>
<P>If this body of private claims of debt, real or de|vi&s;ed, were a que&s;tion, as it is fal&s;ely pretended, be|tween the Nabob of Arcot as debtor, and Paul Benfield and his a&s;&s;ociates as creditors, I am &s;ure I &s;hould give my&s;elf but little trouble about it. If the hoards of oppre&s;&s;ion were the fund for &s;atisfy|ing the claims of bribery and peculation, who would wi&s;h to interfere between &s;uch litigants? If the demands were confined to what might be drawn from the trea&s;ures which the Company's records uniformly a&s;&s;ert that the Nabob is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; or if he had mines of gold or &s;ilver, or diamonds (as we know that he has none) the&s;e gentlemen might break open his hoards, or dig in his mines, without any di&s;turbance from me. But the gentlemen on the other &s;ide of the Hou&s;e know as well as I do, and they dare not contradict me, that the Nabob of Arcot and his creditors are not adver&s;aries, but collu&s;ive parties, and that the whole tran&s;action is under a fal&s;e colour and fal&s;e names. The litigation is not, nor ever has been, between their rapacity and his hoarded riches. No; it is between him and them combining and con|federating on one &s;ide, and the public revenues, and the mi&s;erable inhabitants of a ruined country, on the other. The&s;e are the real plaintiffs and the real defendants in the &s;uit. Refu&s;ing a &s;hilling from his hoards for the &s;atisfaction of any demand, the Nabob of Arcot is always ready, nay, he earne&s;tly, and with eagerne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion, contends for de|livering up to the&s;e pretended creditors his territory and his &s;ubjects. It is therefore not from trea|&s;uries
<PB N="18" REF="26">
and mines, but from the food of your unpaid armies, from the blood withheld from the veins, and whipt out of the backs of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men, that we are to pamper extortion, u&s;ury, and peculation, under the fal&s;e names of debtors and creditors of &s;tate.</P>
<P>The great patron of the&s;e creditors (to who&s;e honour they ought to erect &s;tatues) the right ho|nourable Gentleman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas.</NOTE>, in &s;tating the merits which recommended them to his favour, has ranked them under three grand divi&s;ions. The fir&s;t, the creditors of 1767; then the creditors of the Ca|valry Loan; and la&s;tly, the creditors of the Loan in 1777. Let us examine them, one by one, as they pa&s;s in review before us.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e loans, that of 1767, he in&s;i&s;ts, has an indi&s;putable claim upon the public ju&s;tice. The creditors, he affirms, lent their money publicly; they advanced it with the expre&s;s knowledge and approbation of the Company; and it was contract|ed at the moderate intere&s;t of ten <HI>per cent.</HI> In this loan the demand is, according to him, not only ju&s;t, but meritorious in a very high degree; and one would be inclined to believe he thought &s;o, becau&s;e he has put it la&s;t in the provi&s;ion he has made for the&s;e claims.</P>
<P>I readily admit this debt to &s;tand the faire&s;t of the whole; for whatever may be my &s;u&s;picious concerning a part of it, I can convict it of no|thing wor&s;e than the mo&s;t enormous u&s;ury. But I can convict upon the &s;pot the Right honour|able Gentleman, of the mo&s;t daring mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion in every one fact, without any exception, that he has alledged in defence of this loan, and of his own conduct with regard to it. I will &s;hew you that this debt was never contracted with the know|ledge
<PB N="19" REF="27">
of the Company; that it had not their ap|probation; that they received the fir&s;t intelligence of it with the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;urprize, indignation, and alarm.</P>
<P>So far from being previou&s;ly apprized of the tran&s;action from its origin, that it was two years before the Court of Directors obtained any official intelligence of it.
<Q>The dealings of the &s;ervants with the Nabob were concealed from the fir&s;t, until they were found out, (&s;ays Mr. Sayer, the Company's council) by the report of the country.</Q>
The Pre&s;idency, however, at la&s;t thought proper to &s;end an official account. On this the Directors tell them,
<Q>to your great reproach it has been <HI>con|cealed from us.</HI> We cannot but &s;u&s;pect this debt to have had its weight in <HI>your propo&s;ed aggran|dizement of Mahomed Ali</HI> [the Nabob of Arcot]; but whether it has or has not, certain it is, you are guilty of an high breach of duty in <HI>con|cealing</HI> it from us.</Q></P>

John Pybus, John Call, and James Bour|chier, as tru&s;tees for them&s;elves and others of the Nabob's private creditors, had proved a deed of a&s;&s;ignment upon the Nabob and his &s;on of FIFTEEN di&s;tricts of the Nabob's coun|try, the revenues of which yielded, in time of peace, eight lacks of pagodas [&pound;.320,000, &s;ter|ling] annually; and likewi&s;e an a&s;&s;ignment of the yearly tribute paid the Nabob from the Rajah of Tanjore, amounting to four lacks of rupees [&pound;.40,000].</Q>
The territorial revenue, at that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the&s;e gentlemen, without the knowledge or con&s;ent of their ma&s;ters, amounted
<PB N="20" REF="28">
to three hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pound &s;ter|ling annually. They were making rapid &s;trides to the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, when the Directors, whom the right honourable gentleman &s;tates as having authori&s;ed the&s;e proceedings, were kept in &s;uch profound ignorance of this royal acqui&s;ition of territorial revenue by their &s;ervants, that in the &s;ame letter they &s;ay,
<Q>this a&s;&s;ign|ment was obtained by <HI>three of the members of your Board,</HI> in January 1767, yet we do not find the <HI>lea&s;t trace</HI> of it upon your Con&s;ultations, until Augu&s;t 1768, nor do any of your letters to us afford any information relative to &s;uch tran&s;ac|tions, till the 1&s;t of November 1768. By your la&s;t letters of the 8th of May 1769, you bring the whole proceedings to light in one view.</Q></P>
<P>As to the previous knowledge of the Com|pany, and its &s;anction to the debts, you &s;ee that this a&s;&s;ertion of that knowledge is utterly un|founded. But did the Directors approve of it, and ratify the tran&s;action when it was known? The very rever&s;e. On the &s;ame 3d of March, the Directors declare,
<Q>upon an <HI>impartial examination</HI> of the whole conduct of our late Governor and Council of Fort George (Madras) and on the fulle&s;t con&s;ideration, that the &s;aid Governor and Council have, <HI>in notorious violation of the tru&s;t</HI> re|po&s;ed in them, manife&s;tly <HI>pre&s;erred the intere&s;t of private individuals to that of the Company,</HI> in per|mitting the a&s;&s;ignment of the revenues of certain valuable di&s;tricts, to a very large amount, from the Nabob to individuals</Q>
&mdash;and then highly aggra|vating their crimes, they add
<Q>we order and direct that you do examine, in the mo&s;t impartial man|ner, all the above-mentioned tran&s;actions; and that you <HI>puni&s;h</HI> by &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, degradation, di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion, or otherwi&s;e, as to you &s;hall &s;eem meet, all and every &s;uch &s;ervant or &s;ervants of the Com|pany,
<PB N="21" REF="29">
who may by you be found guilty of any of the above offences.</Q>
<Q>We had (&s;ay the Di|rectors) the mortification to find that the &s;ervants of the Company, who had been <HI>rai&s;ed, &s;upported, and owed their pre&s;ent opulence to the advantages</HI> gained in &s;uch &s;ervice, have in this in&s;tance mo&s;t <HI>unfaithfully betrayed</HI> their tru&s;t, <HI>abandoned</HI> the Company's intere&s;t, and <HI>pro&s;tituted</HI> its influence to accompli&s;h the <HI>purpo&s;es of individuals, whil&s;t the intere&s;t of the Company is almo&s;t wholly neglected,</HI> and payment to us rendered extremely preca|rious.</Q>
Here then is the rock of approbation of the Court of Directors, on which the right ho|nourable gentleman &s;ays this debt was founded. Any Member, Mr. Speaker, who &s;hould come into the Hou&s;e, on my reading this &s;entence of condemnation of the Court of Directors again&s;t their unfaithful &s;ervants, might well imagine that he had heard an har&s;h, &s;evere, unqualified invective again&s;t the pre&s;ent mini&s;terial Board of Control. So exactly do the proceedings of the patrons of this abu&s;e tally with tho&s;e of the actors in it, that the expre&s;|&s;ions u&s;ed in the condemnation of the one, may &s;erve for the reprobation of the other, without the change of a word.</P>
<P>To read you all the expre&s;&s;ions of wrath and in|dignation fulminated in this di&s;patch again&s;t the meritorious creditors of the right honourable gen|tleman, who according to him have been &s;o fully approved by the Company, would be to read the whole.</P>
<P>The right honourable gentleman, with an addre&s;s peculiar to him&s;elf, every now and then &s;lides in the Pre&s;idency of Madras, as &s;ynonymous to the Company. That the Pre&s;idency did approve the debt, is certain. But the right honourable gentle|man, as prudent in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing, as &s;kilful in bring|ing forward his matter, has not cho&s;en to tell you
<PB N="22" REF="30">
that the Pre&s;idency were the very per&s;ons guilty of contracting this loan; creditors them&s;elves, and agents, and tru&s;tees for all the other creditors. For this the Court of Directors accu&s;e them of breach of tru&s;t; and for this the right honourable gentleman con&s;iders them as perfectly good autho|rity for tho&s;e claims. It is plea&s;ant to hear a gentleman of the law quote the approbation of creditors as an authority for their own debt.</P>
<P>How they came to contract the debt to them|&s;elves, how they came to act as agents for tho&s;e whom they ought to have controlled, is for your enquiry. The policy of this debt was announced to the Court of Directors, by the very per&s;ons con|cerned in creating it.
<Q>Till very lately, (&s;ay the Pre&s;idency) the Nabob placed his depen|dence on the Company. Now he has been taught by ill-advi&s;ers, that an intere&s;t out of doors may &s;tand him in good &s;tead. He has been made to believe that <HI>his private creditors have power and intere&s;t to over-rule the Court of Directors</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the threats of the creditors, and total &s;ubver&s;ion of the authority of the Company in favour of the Nabob's power, and the encrea&s;e thereby of his evil di&s;po&s;itions, and the great derangement of all public concerns, &s;ee Select Committee Fort St. George's letters, 21&s;t November 1769, and January 31&s;t, 1770; September 11, 1772. And Gover|nor Bourchier's letters to the Nabob of Arcot, 21&s;t November 1769, and December 9th, 1769.</NOTE>.</Q>
The Nabob was not mi&s;in|formed. The private creditors in&s;tantly qualified a va&s;t number of votes; and having made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of the Court of Proprietors, as well as extending a powerful cabal in other places as important, they &s;o completely overturned the au|thority of the Court of Directors at home and abroad, that this poor baffled government was &s;oon obliged to lower its tone. It was glad to be ad|mitted into a partner&s;hip with its own &s;ervants.
<PB N="23" REF="31">
The Court of Directors e&s;tabli&s;hing the debt which they had reprobated as a breach of tru&s;t, and which was planned for the &s;ubver&s;ion of their authority, &s;ettled its payments on a par with tho&s;e of the pub|lic; and even &s;o, were not able to obtain peace or even equality in their demands. All the con&s;e|quences lay in a regular and irre&s;i&s;tible train. By employing their influence for the recovery of this debt, their orders, i&s;&s;ued in the &s;ame breath, again&s;t creating new debts, only animated the &s;trong de&s;ires of their &s;ervants to this prohibited prolific &s;port, and it &s;oon produced a &s;warm of &s;ons and daugh|ters, not in the lea&s;t degenerated from the virtue of their parents.</P>
<P>From that moment, the authority of the Court of Directors expired in the Carnatic, and every where el&s;e. <Q>Every man, &s;ays the Pre&s;idency, who oppo&s;es the government and its mea&s;ures, finds an immediate countenance from the Na|bob, even our di&s;carded officers, however un|worthy, are received into the Nabob's &s;ervice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>He [the Nabob] is in a great degree the cau&s;e of our pre&s;ent inability; by diverting the revenues of the Carnatic through <HI>private channels.</HI></Q>

It was indeed a matter of no wonderful &s;agacity to determine whether the Court of Directors, with their mi&s;erable &s;alaries to their &s;ervants, of four or five hundred pound a year, or the di&s;tributor of mil|lions, was mo&s;t likely to be obeyed. It was an in|vention beyond the imagination of all the &s;pecu|lati&s;ts of our &s;peculating age, to &s;ee a govern|ment quietly &s;ettled in one and the &s;ame town, compo&s;ed of two di&s;tinct members; one to pay &s;cantily for obedience, and the other to bribe high for rebellion and revolt.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="32">The next thing which recommends this particu|lar debt to the right honourable gentleman, is, it &s;eems, the moderate intere&s;t of ten <HI>per cent.</HI> It would be lo&s;t labour to ob&s;erve on this a&s;|&s;ertion. The Nabob, in a long apologetic letter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nabob's Letter to Governor Palk. Papers publi&s;hed by the Directors in 1775; papers printed by the &s;ame au|thority, 1781.</NOTE> for the tran&s;action between him and the body of the creditors, &s;tates the fact, as I &s;hall &s;tate it to you.

&mdash;Letter 15th "January, 1772,
<Q>Notwith&s;tanding I have taken much trouble, and have made many payments to my creditors, yet the load of my debt, <HI>which became &s;o great, by intere&s;t and compound intere&s;t,</HI> is not cleared.</Q></NOTE>, was added to the old, and the &s;ame intere&s;t of twenty <HI>per cent.</HI> accrued upon both. The Company, having got &s;ome &s;cent of the enormous u&s;ury which prevailed at Madras, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to interfere, and to order all intere&s;ts to be lowered to ten <HI>per cent.</HI> This order, which contained no exception, though it by no means pointed particularly to this cla&s;s of debts, came like a thunder-clap on the Nabob. He con&s;idered his political credit as ruined; but to find a remedy to this unexpected evil, he again ad|ded to the old principal twenty <HI>per cent.</HI> intere&s;t accruing for the la&s;t year. Thus a new fund was formed; and it was on that accumulation of va|rious principals, and intere&s;ts heaped upon intere&s;ts,
<PB N="25" REF="33">
not on the &s;um originally lent, as the right ho|nourable Gentleman would make you believe, that ten <HI>per cent.</HI> was &s;ettled on the whole.</P>
<P>When you con&s;ider the enormity of the intere&s;t at which the&s;e debts were contracted, and the &s;e|veral intere&s;ts added to the principal, I believe you will not think me &s;o &s;ceptical, if I &s;hould doubt, whether for this debt of &pound;. 880,000, the Nabob ever &s;aw &pound;. 100,000 in real money. The right honourable gentleman &s;u&s;pecting, with all his ab&s;olute domi|nion over fact, that he never will be able to defend even this venerable patriarchal job, though &s;anctified by its numerous i&s;&s;ue, and hoary with pre&s;criptive years, has recour&s;e to recrimination, the la&s;t re&s;ource of guilt. He &s;ays that this loan of 1767 was provided for in Mr. Fox's India bill; and judging of others by his own nature and principles, he more than in&s;i|nuates, that this provi&s;ion was made, not from any &s;en&s;e of merit in the claim, but from partiality to General Smith, a proprietor, and an agent for that debt. If partiality could have had any weight again&s;t ju&s;tice and policy, with the then mini&s;ters and their friends, General Smith had titles to it. But the right honourable gentleman knows as well as I do, that General Smith was very far from looking on him&s;elf as partially treated in the ar|rangements of that time; indeed what man dared to hope for private partiality in that &s;acred plan for relief to nations?</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary that the right honourable gentleman &s;hould &s;arca&s;tically call that time to our recollection. Well do I remember every circum|&s;tance of that memorable period. God forbid I &s;hould forget it. O illu&s;trious di&s;grace! O victo|rious defeat! May your memorial be fre&s;h and new to the late&s;t generations! May the day of that ge|nerous conflict be &s;tamped in characters never to be cancelled or worn out from the records of time!
<PB N="26" REF="34">
Let no man hear of us, who &s;hall not hear that in a &s;truggle again&s;t the intrigues of courts, and the perfidious levity of the multitude, we fell in the cau&s;e of honour, in the cau&s;e of our country, in the cau&s;e of human nature it&s;elf! But if Fortune &s;hould be as powerful over Fame, as &s;he has been prevalent over Virtue, at lea&s;t our con&s;cience is beyond her juri&s;diction.

It &s;hall be &s;afely lodged in the &s;anctuary of my heart; never, never to be torn from thence, but with tho&s;e holds that grapple it to life.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, I well remember that bill, and every one of its hone&s;t and its wi&s;e provi&s;ions. It is not true that this debt was ever protected or inforced, or any revenue what&s;oever &s;et apart for it. It was left in that bill ju&s;t where it &s;tood; to be paid or not to be paid out of the Nabob's private trea&s;ures, ac|cording to his own di&s;cretion. The Company had actually given it their &s;anction; though always re|lying for its validity on the &s;ole &s;ecurity of the faith of him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Nabob of Arcot.</NOTE> who without their knowlege or con&s;ent entered into the original obligation. It had no other &s;anction; it ought to have had no other. So far was Mr. Fox's bill from provid|ing <HI>funds</HI> for it, as this mini&s;try have wickedly done for this, and for ten times wor&s;e tran&s;ac|tions, out of the public e&s;tate, that an expre&s;s clau&s;e immediately preceded, po&s;itively forbidding any Briti&s;h &s;ubject from receiving a&s;&s;ignments upon any part of the territorial revenue, on any pretence what&s;oever <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Appendix N^o 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>You recollect, Mr. Speaker, that the Chan|cellor of the Exchequer &s;trongly profe&s;&s;ed to retain every part of Mr. Fox's bill, which was
<PB N="27" REF="35">
intended to prevent abu&s;e; but in <HI>his</HI> India bill, which (let me do ju&s;tice) is as able and &s;kilful a performance for its own purpo&s;es, as ever i&s;&s;ued from the wit of man, premeditating this ini|quity&mdash;<HI>hoc ip&s;um ut &s;trueret Trojamque aperiret Achivis,</HI> expunged this e&s;&s;ential clau&s;e, broke down the fence which was rai&s;ed to cover the pub|lic property again&s;t the rapacity of his partizans, and thus levelling every ob&s;truction, he made a firm, broad, highway for &s;in and death, for u&s;ury and oppre&s;&s;ion, to renew their ravages throughout the devoted revenues of the Carnatic.</P>
<P>The tenor, the policy, and the con&s;equences of this debt of 1767, are, in the eyes of Mini&s;try, &s;o excellent, that its merits are irre&s;i&s;tible; and it takes the lead to give credit and countenance to all the re&s;t. Along with this cho&s;en body of heavy-armed infantry, and to &s;upport it, in the line, the right honourable gentleman has &s;tationed his corps of black cavalry. If there be any advantage between this debt and that of 1769, according to him the cavalry debt has it. It is not a &s;ubject of defence; it is a theme of panegyric. Li&s;ten to the right ho|nourable gentleman, and you will find it was con|tracted to &s;ave the country; to prevent mutiny in armies; to introduce oeconomy in revenues; and for all the&s;e honourable purpo&s;es, it originated at the expre&s;s de&s;ire, and by the repre&s;entative autho|rity of the Company it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, let me &s;ay a word to the authority. This debt was contracted not by the authority of the Company, not by its repre&s;entatives (as the right honourable Gentleman has the unparalleled con|fidence to a&s;&s;ert) but in the ever-memorable period of 1777, by the u&s;urped power of tho&s;e who re|belliou&s;ly, in conjunction with the Nabob of Ar|cot, had overturned the lawful government of Madras. For that rebellion, this Hou&s;e unani|mou&s;ly
<PB N="28" REF="36">
directed a public pro&s;ecution. The delin|quents, after they had &s;ubverted Government, in order to make to them&s;elves a party to &s;upport them in their power, are univer&s;ally known to have dealt jobs about to the right and to the left, and to any who were willing to receive them. This u&s;urpation, which the right honourable Gentleman well knows, was brought about by and for the great ma&s;s of the&s;e pretended debts, is the authority which is &s;et up by him to repre|&s;ent the Company; to repre&s;ent that Company which from the fir&s;t moment of their hearing of this corrupt and fraudulent tran&s;action, to this hour, have uniformly di&s;owned and di&s;avowed it.</P>
<P>So much for the authority. As to the facts, partly true, and partly colourable, as they &s;tand record|ed, they are in &s;ub&s;tance the&s;e.&mdash;The Nabob of Arcot, as &s;oon as he had thrown off the &s;uperio|rity of this country by means of the&s;e creditors, kept up a great army which he never paid. Of cour&s;e, his &s;oldiers were generally in a &s;tate of muti|ny <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Dundas's 1&s;t, 2d, and 3d Reports.</NOTE>. The u&s;urping council &s;ay that they laboured hard with their ma&s;ter the Nabob, to per&s;uade him to reduce the&s;e mutinous and u&s;ele&s;s troops. He con&s;ented; but as u&s;ual, pleaded inability to pay them their arrears. Here was a difficulty. The Na|bob had no money; the Company had no money; every public &s;upply was empty. But there was one re&s;ource which no &s;ea&s;on has ever yet dried up in that climate. The <HI>&s;oucars</HI> were at hand; that is, private Engli&s;h money-jobbers offered their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Me&s;&s;ieurs Taylor, Majendie and Call, pro|po&s;ed to advance the &s;mall &s;um of &pound;. 160,000 to pay off the Nabob's black cavalry, provided the Company's authority was given for their loan. This was the great point of policy always aimed
<PB N="29" REF="37">
at, and pur&s;ued through a hundred devices, by the &s;ervants at Madras. The Pre&s;idency, who them|&s;elves had no authority for the functions they pre|&s;umed to exerci&s;e, very readily gave the &s;anction of the Company, to tho&s;e &s;ervants who knew that the Company, who&s;e &s;anction was demanded, had po&s;itively prohibited all &s;uch tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>However, &s;o far as the reality of the dealing goes, all is hitherto fair and plau&s;ible; and here the right honourable Gentleman concludes, with commend|able prudence, his account of the bu&s;ine&s;s. But here it is I &s;hall beg leave to commence my &s;up|plement: for the gentleman's di&s;creet mode&s;ty has led him to cut the thread of the &s;tory &s;omewhat abruptly. One of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parties is quite forgotten. Why &s;hould the epi&s;ode of the poor Nabob be omitted? When that prince chu&s;es it, no body can tell his &s;tory better. Excu&s;e me, if I apply again to my book, and give it you from the fir&s;t hand; from the Nabob him&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q>Mr. Stratton became acquainted with this, and got Mr. Taylor and others to lend me four lacks of pagodas towards di&s;charging the arrears of pay of my troops. Upon this, I wrote a letter of thanks to Mr. Stratton; and upon the faith of this money being paid immediately, I ordered many of my troops to be di&s;charged by a certain day, and le&s;&s;ened the number of my &s;ervants. Mr. Taylor, &amp;c. &s;ome time after acquainted me, that they had no ready money, but they would grant teeps payable in four months. This a&s;toni&s;hed me; for I did not know what might happen, when the &s;epoys were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from my &s;ervice. I begged of Mr. Tay|lor and the others to pay this &s;um to the officers of my regiments at the time they mentioned; and de&s;ired the officers, at the &s;ame time, to pacify and per&s;uade the men belonging to them,
<PB N="30" REF="38">
that their pay would be given to them <HI>at the end of four months</HI>; and that till tho&s;e arrears were di&s;charged, their pay &s;hould be continued to them. <HI>Two years</HI> are nearly expired &s;ince that time, but Mr. Taylor has not yet entirely di&s;charged the arrears of tho&s;e troops, and I am obliged to continue their pay from that time till this. I hoped to have been able, by this expedient, to have le&s;&s;ened the number of my troops, and di&s;charge the arrears due to them, con&s;idering the trifle of intere&s;t to Mr. Taylor, and the others, as no great matter; but in&s;tead of this, <HI>I am oppre&s;&s;ed with the burthen of pay due to tho&s;e troops; and the intere&s;t, which is going on to Mr. Taylor from the day the teeps were granted to him.</HI></Q>
What I have read to you is an extract of a Letter from the Nabob of the Carnatic to Governor Rumbold, dated the 22d, and received the 24th of March 1779 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See further Con&s;ultations, 3d February 1778.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e his highne&s;s not to be well broken in to things of this kind, it mu&s;t indeed &s;urpri&s;e &s;o known and e&s;tabli&s;hed a bond-vender, as the Nabob of Arcot, one who keeps him&s;elf the large&s;t bond warehou&s;e in the world, to find that he was now to receive in kind; not to take money for his obliga|tions, but to give his bond in exchange for the bond of Me&s;&s;ieurs Taylor, Majendie and Call, and to pay be&s;ides, a good &s;mart intere&s;t, legally 12 <HI>per cent.</HI> [in reality perhaps twenty, or twenty-four <HI>per cent.</HI>] for this exchange of paper. But his troops were not to be &s;o paid, or &s;o di&s;banded. They wanted bread, and could not live by cutting and &s;huffling of bonds. The Nabob &s;till kept the troops in &s;er|vice, and was obliged to continue, as you have &s;een, the whole expence, to exonerate him&s;elf from which he became indebted to the &s;oucars.</P>
<P>Had it &s;tood here, the tran&s;action would have
<PB N="31" REF="39">
been of the mo&s;t audacious &s;train of fraud and u&s;ury, perhaps ever before di&s;covered, whatever might have been practi&s;ed and concealed. But the &s;ame authority (I mean the Nabob's) brings before you &s;omething if po&s;&s;ible more &s;triking. He &s;tates, that for this their paper, he immediately handed over to the&s;e gentlemen, &s;omething very different from paper; that is, the receipt of a territorial re|venue, of which it &s;eems they continued as long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as the Nabob him&s;elf continued in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any thing. Their payments there|fore not being to commence before the end of four months, and not being compleated in two years, it mu&s;t be pre&s;umed (unle&s;s they prove the contrary) that their payments to the Nabob were made out of the revenues they had received from his a&s;&s;ignment. Thus they conde&s;cend to accumulate a debt of &pound;. 160,000, with an intere&s;t of 12 <HI>per cent.</HI> in com|pen&s;ation for a lingering payment to the Nabob, of &pound;.160,000 of his own money.</P>
<P>Still we have not the whole: about two years after the a&s;&s;ignment of tho&s;e territorial revenues to the&s;e gentlemen, the Nabob receives a remon&s;trance from his chief manager, in a principal province, of which this is the tenor&mdash;
<Q>The <HI>entire</HI> revenue of tho&s;e di&s;tricts is by your highne&s;s' order &s;et apart to di&s;charge the tuncaws [a&s;&s;ignments] granted to the Europeans. The goma&s;tahs [agents] of Mr. Taylor, to Mr. De Fries, are there in order to collect the&s;e tuncaws; and as they receive <HI>all</HI> the revenue that is collected, your high|ne&s;s's troops have <HI>&s;even or eight months pay due,</HI> which they cannot receive, and are thereby re|duced to the greate&s;t <HI>di&s;tre&s;s.

<P>Here, Sir, you &s;ee how the&s;e cau&s;es and effects

act upon one another. One body of troops mutinies for want of pay; a debt is contracted to pay them; and they &s;till remain unpaid. A territory de&s;tined to pay other troops, is a&s;&s;igned for this debt; and the&s;e other troops fall into the &s;ame &s;tate of indi|gence and mutiny with the fir&s;t. Bond is paid by bond; arrear is turned into new arrear; u&s;ury engenders new u&s;ury; mutiny &s;u&s;pended in one quarter, &s;tarts up in another; until all the re|venues, and all the e&s;tabli&s;hments are entangled into one inextricable knot of confu&s;ion, from which they are only di&s;engaged by being entirely de&s;troyed. In that &s;tate of confu&s;ion, in a very few months after the date of the memorial I have ju&s;t read to you, things were found, when the Nabob's troops, fami&s;hed to feed Engli&s;h &s;oucars, in&s;tead of defend|ing the country, joined the invaders, and de&s;erted in entire bodies to Hyder Ali <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas's 1&s;t Report, p. 26, 29, and Appendix N^o 2, 10, 18, for the mutinous &s;tate and de&s;ertion of the Nabob's troops for want of pay.

Here the Governor, being ca&s;h-keeper, is generally on good terms with the banker, who manages matters thus: The Governor pre&s;&s;es the Nabob for the balance due from him; the Nabob flies to his banker for relief; the banker engages to pay the money, and grants his notes accordingly, which he puts in the ca&s;h-book as ready money; the Nabob pays him an intere&s;t for it at <HI>two and three per cent. per men&s;em,</HI> till the tunkaws he grants on the particular di&s;tricts for it are paid. Matters in the mean time are &s;o managed, that there is no call for this money for the Company's &s;er|vice, till the tuncaws become due.

Nobody, indeed, has yet been found hardy enough to &s;tand forth avowedly in its defence. But it is little to the credit of the age, that what has not plau&s;ibility enough to find an advocate, has influence enough to obtain a pro|tector.

<P>But what corrupt men, in the fond imaginations of a &s;anguine avarice, had not the confidence to propo&s;e, they have found a Chancellor of the Ex|chequer in England hardy enough to undertake for them.

He has replaced the twenty-five <HI>per cent.</HI> which, in order to lighten them&s;elves, they had abandoned in their con&s;cious terror. In&s;tead of cutting off the intere&s;t, as they had them&s;elves con&s;ented to do, with the fourth of the capital, he has added the whole growth of four years u&s;ury of twelve <HI>per cent.</HI> to the fir&s;t over-grown principal; and has again grafted on this meliorated &s;tock a perpetual annuity of &s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI> to take place from the year 1781.

of the decaying energies of nature. All the acts and monuments in the records of peculation; the con&s;olidated corruption of ages; the patterns of exemplary plunder in the heroic times of Roman iniquity, never equalled the gigantic corruption of this &s;ingle act. Never did Nero, in all the in&s;olent prodigality of de&s;poti&s;m, deal out to his praetorian guards a donation fit to be named with the large&s;s &s;howered down by the bounty of our Chancellor of the Exchequer on the faithful band of his Indian Sepoys.</P>
<P>The right honourable gentleman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas.</NOTE> lets you freely and voluntarily into the whole tran&s;action. So per|fectly has his conduct confounded his under&s;tand|ing, that he fairly tells you, that through the cour&s;e of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s he has never con|ferred with any but the agents of the pretended creditors. After this, do you want more to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a &s;ecret under&s;tanding with the parties? to fix, beyond a doubt, their collu&s;ion and parti|cipation in a common fraud?</P>
<P>If this were not enough, he has furni&s;hed you with other pre&s;umptions that are not to be &s;haken. It is one of the known indications of guilt to &s;tag|ger and prevaricate in a &s;tory; and to vary in the motives that are a&s;&s;igned to conduct. Try the&s;e Mini&s;ters by this rule. In their official di&s;patch, they tell the Pre&s;idency of Madras, that they have e&s;tabli&s;hed the debt for two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, becau&s;e the Nabob (the party indebted) does not di&s;pute it; &s;econdly, becau&s;e it is mi&s;chievous to keep it longer afloat; and that the payment of the European creditors will promote circulation in the country. The&s;e two motives (for the plaine&s;t rea&s;ons in the world) the right honourable gentleman has this day thought fit totally to abandon. In the fir&s;t place, he rejects the authority of the Nabob of Arcot.
<PB N="39" REF="47">
It would indeed be plea&s;ant to &s;ee him adhere to this exploded te&s;timony. He next, upon grounds equally &s;olid, abandons the benefits of that circu|lation, which was to be produced by drawing out all the juices of the body. Laying a&s;ide, or for|getting the&s;e pretences of his di&s;patch, he has ju&s;t now a&s;&s;umed a principle totally different, but to the full as extraordinary. He proceeds upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that many of the claims may be fic|titious. He then finds, that in a ca&s;e where many valid and many fraudulent claims are blended together, the be&s;t cour&s;e for their di&s;crimination is indi&s;criminately to e&s;tabli&s;h them all. He tru&s;ts (I &s;uppo&s;e) as there may not be a fund &s;ufficient for every de&s;cription of creditors, that the be&s;t warranted claimants will exert them&s;elves in bring|ing to light tho&s;e debts which will not bear an en|quiry. What he will not do him&s;elf, he is per&s;uad|ed will be done by others; and for this purpo&s;e he leaves to any per&s;on a general power of excepting to the debt. This total change of language, and prevarication in principle, is enough, if it &s;tood alone, to fix the pre&s;umption of unfair dealing. His di&s;patch a&s;&s;igns motives of policy, concord, trade, and circulation. His &s;peech proclaims di&s;|cord and litigations; and propo&s;es, as the ultimate end, detection.</P>
<P>But he may &s;hift his rea&s;ons, and wind, and turn as he will, confu&s;ion waits him at all his doubles. Who will undertake this detection? Will the Nabob? But the right honourable gen|tleman has him&s;elf this moment told us, that no prince of the country can by any motive be pre|vailed upon to di&s;cover any fraud that is prac|ti&s;ed upon him by the Company's &s;ervants. He &s;ays what, (with the exception of the complaint again&s;t the cavalry loan) all the world knows to
<PB N="40" REF="48">
be true; and without that Prince's concurrence, what evidence can be had of the fraud of any the &s;malle&s;t of the&s;e demands? The Mini&s;ters ne|ver authorized any per&s;on to enter into his ex|chequer, and to &s;earch his records. Why then this &s;hameful and in&s;ulting mockery of a pretended conte&s;t? Already conte&s;ts for a preference have ari&s;en among the&s;e rival bond creditors. Has not the Company it&s;elf &s;truggled for a preference for years, without any attempt at detection of the na|ture of tho&s;e debts with which they contended? Well is the Nabob of Arcot attended to in the only &s;pecific complaint he has ever made. He com|plained of unfair dealing in the cavalry loan. It is fixed upon him with intere&s;t on intere&s;t; and this loan is excepted from all power of litigation.</P>
<P>This day, and not before, the right honoura|ble gentleman thinks that the general e&s;tabli&s;hment of all claims is the &s;ure&s;t way of laying open the fraud of &s;ome of them. In India, this is a reach of deep policy. But what would be thought of this mode of acting on a demand upon the Trea|&s;ury in England? In&s;tead of all this cunning, is there not one plain way open, that is, to put the burthen of the proof on tho&s;e who make the de|mand? Ought not Mini&s;try to have &s;aid to the creditors,
<Q>The per&s;on who admits your debt &s;tands excepted to as evidence; he &s;tands charged as a collu&s;ive party, to hand over the public re|venues to you for &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es? You &s;ay, you have a demand of &s;ome millions on the In|dian trea&s;ury; prove that you have acted by lawful authority; prove at lea&s;t that your money has been <HI>bon&acirc; fide</HI> advanced; entitle your&s;elf to my protection, by the fairne&s;s and fulne&s;s of the communications you make.</Q>
Did an hone&s;t creditor ever refu&s;e that rea&s;onable and hone&s;t te&s;t?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="49">There is little doubt, that &s;everal individuals have been &s;educed by the purveyors to the Nabob of Arcot to put their money (perhaps the whole of hone&s;t and laborious earnings) into their hands, and that at &s;uch high intere&s;t, as, being condemn|ed at law, leaves them at the mercy of the great managers whom they tru&s;ted. The&s;e &s;educed creditors are probably per&s;ons of no power or inte|re&s;t, either in England or India, and may be ju&s;t objects of compa&s;&s;ion. By taking, in this arrange|ment no mea&s;ures for di&s;crimination and di&s;co|very; the fraudulent and the fair are in the fir&s;t in&s;tance confounded in one ma&s;s. The &s;ub&s;e|quent &s;election and di&s;tribution is left to the Na|bob. With him the agents and in&s;truments of his corruption, whom he &s;ees to be omnipotent in England, and who may &s;erve him in future, as they have done in times pa&s;t, will have precedence, if not an exclu&s;ive preference. The&s;e leading inte|re&s;ts domineer, and have always domineered, over the whole. By this arrangement the per&s;ons &s;educed are made dependent on their &s;educers; hone&s;ty (comparative hone&s;ty at lea&s;t) mu&s;t become of the party of fraud, and mu&s;t quit its proper character, and its ju&s;t claims, to entitle it&s;elf to the alms of bribery and peculation.</P>
<P>But be the&s;e Engli&s;h creditors what they may, the creditors, mo&s;t certainly not fraudulent, are the natives, who are numerous and wretched indeed: by exhau&s;ting the whole revenues of the Carnatic, nothing is left for them. They lent <HI>bona&acirc; fide</HI>; in all probability they were even forced to lend, or to give goods and &s;ervice for the Nabob's obligations. They had no tru&s;ts to carry to his market. They had no faith of alliances to &s;ell. They had no nations to be|tray to robbery and ruin. They had no lawful go|vernment &s;editiou&s;ly to overturn; nor had they a

<P>The&s;e were the merits of the principal part of the debt of 1777, and the univer&s;ally conceived cau&s;es of its growth; and thus the unhappy natives are deprived of every hope of payment for their real debts, to make provi&s;ion for the arrears of un&s;atis|fied bribery and trea&s;on. You &s;ee in this in&s;tance, that the pre&s;umption of guilt is not only no ex|ception to the demands on the public trea&s;ury; but with the&s;e mini&s;ters it is a nece&s;&s;ary condition to their &s;upport. But that you may not think this pre|ference &s;olely owing to their known contempt of the natives, who ought with every generous mind to claim their fir&s;t charities; you will find the &s;ame rule religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved with Europeans too. At|tend, Sir, to this deci&s;ive ca&s;e.&mdash;Since the begin|ning of the war, be&s;ides arrears of every kind, a bond debt has been contracted at Madras, uncertain in its amount, but repre&s;ented from four hundred thou&s;and pound to a million &s;terling. It &s;tands only at the low intere&s;t of eight <HI>per cent.</HI> Of the legal authority on which this debt was contracted, of its purpo&s;es for the very being of the &s;tate, of its publicity and fairne&s;s, no doubt has been en|tertained for a moment. For this debt, no &s;ort of provi&s;ion whatever has been made. It is rejected as an outca&s;t, whil&s;t the whole undi&s;&s;ipated atten|tion of the Mini&s;ter has been employed for the di&s;charge of claims entitled to his favour by the merits we have &s;een.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to find out, if po&s;&s;ible, the amount of the whole of tho&s;e demands, in order to &s;ee how much, &s;uppo&s;ing the country in a con|dition to furni&s;h the fund, may remain to &s;atisfy

the public debt and the nece&s;&s;ary e&s;tabli&s;hments. But I have been foiled in my attempt. About one-fourth, that is about &pound;. 220,000 of the loan of 1767, remains unpaid. How much intere&s;t is in arrear, I could never di&s;cover; &s;even or eight years at lea&s;t, which would make the whole of that debt about &pound;. 396,000. This &s;tock, which the Mini&s;ters in their in&s;tructions to the Governor of Madras &s;tate as the lea&s;t exceptionable, they have thought proper to di&s;tingui&s;h by a marked &s;everity, leaving it the only one, on which the intere&s;t is not added to the principal, to beget a new intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The cavalry loan, by the operation of the &s;ame authority, is made up to &pound;.294,000, and this &pound;. 294,000, made up of principal and intere&s;t, is crowned with a new intere&s;t of twelve <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>What the grand loan, the bribery loan of 1777, may be, is among&s;t the deepe&s;t my&s;teries of &s;tate.

<Q>How &s;hall I paint to you my a&s;toni&s;h|ment on my arrival here, when I was informed, that inde|pendent of this four lacks of pagodas [the cavalry loan]; independent of the Nabob's debt to his old creditors, and the money due to the Company; he had contracted a debt to the enormous amount of &s;ixty-three lacks of pagodas [&pound;. 2,520,000].&mdash;I mention this circum&s;tance to you <HI>with horror</HI>; for the creditors being in general <HI>&s;ervants of the Company,</HI> renders my ta&s;k, on the part of the Company, <HI>difficult and invidious.</HI></Q> &mdash; <Q>I have freed the &s;anction of this government from <HI>&s;o corrupt</HI> a tran&s;action. It is, in my mind, the mo&s;t venal of all proceedings, to give the Com|pany's protection to debts that cannot bear the light; and though it appears exceedingly alarming, that a country, on which you are to depend for re&s;ources, &s;hould be &s;o involved, as to be nearly three years revenue in debt; in a country too, where one year's revenue can never be called <HI>&s;ecure,</HI> by men who know any thing of the politics of this part of India.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>I think it proper to mention to you, that although the <HI>Nabob reports his private debt to amount to upwards of &s;ixty lacks,</HI> yet I under&s;tand that it is not quite &s;o much.</Q>
&mdash;Afterwards Sir Thomas Rumbold recommended this debt to the favourable attention of the Company, but without any &s;ufficient rea&s;on for his change of di&s;po&s;ition. However he went no further.</NOTE>. It afterwards fell into &s;uch a terror, as to &s;weat away a million of its weight at once;
<PB N="44" REF="52">
and it &s;unk to &pound;. 1,400,000 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nabob's propo&s;als, November 25th, 1778; and memorial of the creditors, March 1&s;t, 1779.</NOTE>. However, it never was without a re&s;ource for recruiting it to its old plumpne&s;s. There was a &s;ort of floating debt of about 4 or &pound;. 500,000 more, ready to be added, as occa&s;ion &s;hould require.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, when you pre&s;&s;ed this &s;en&s;itive plant, it always contracted its dimen&s;ions. When the rude hand of enquiry was withdrawn, it expanded in all the luxuriant vigour of its original vegetation. In the treaty of 1781, the whole of the Nabob's debt to private Europeans is by Mr. Sullivan, agent to the Nabob and the creditors, &s;tated at &pound; 2,800,000, which (if the cavalry loan, and the remains of the debt of 1767, be &s;ubtracted) leaves it nearly at the amount originally declared at the Durbar, in 1777. But then there is a private in&s;truction to Mr. Sullivan, which it &s;eems will re|duce it again to the lower &s;tandard of &pound;. 1,400,000. Failing in all my attempts, by a direct account, to
<PB N="45" REF="53">
a&s;certain the extent of the capital claimed (where in all probability no capital was ever advanced) I en|deavoured, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;cover it by the intere&s;t which was to be paid. For that purpo&s;e, I looked to the &s;everal agreements for a&s;&s;igning the territories of the Carnatic to &s;ecure the principal and intere&s;t of this debt. In one of them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nabob's propo&s;als to his new con&s;olidated creditors, No|vember 25th, 1778.</NOTE> I found in a &s;ort of Po&s;t&s;cript, by way of an additional remark, (not in the body of the obligation) the debt repre&s;ented at &pound;. 1,400,000. But when I computed the &s;ums to be paid for intere&s;t by in&s;talments in another paper, I found they produced the intere&s;t of two millions, at twelve <HI>per cent.</HI> and the a&s;&s;ignment &s;uppo&s;ed, that if the&s;e in&s;talments might exceed, they might al&s;o fall &s;hort of the real provi&s;ion for that intere&s;t <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Paper &s;igned by the Nabob, 6th January 1780.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another in&s;talment bond was afterwards granted. In that bond the intere&s;t exactly tallies with a ca|pital of &pound;. 1,400,000 <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ki&s;tbundi to July 31, 1780.</NOTE>. But pur&s;uing this capital through the corre&s;pondence, I lo&s;t &s;ight of it again, and it was a&s;&s;erted that this in&s;talment bond was con|&s;iderably &s;hort of the intere&s;t that ought to be com|puted to the time mentioned <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Governor's letter to the Nabob, 25th 1779.</NOTE>. Here are, therefore, two &s;tatements of equal authority, differing at lea&s;t a million from each other; and as neither per&s;ons claiming, nor any &s;pecial &s;um as belonging to each particular claimant, is a&s;certained in the in&s;truments of con&s;olidation, or in the in&s;talment bonds, a large &s;cope was left to throw in any &s;ums for any per&s;ons, as their merits in advancing the intere&s;t of that loan might require; a power was al&s;o left for reduc|tion, in ca&s;e a harder hand, or more &s;canty funds, might be found to require it. Stronger grounds for a pre&s;umption of fraud never appeared in any

But the mini&s;ters, faithful to the plan of the intere&s;ted per&s;ons, whom alone they thought fit to confer with on this occa&s;ion, have ordered the payment of the whole ma&s;s of the&s;e unknown unliquidated &s;ums, without an attempt to a&s;certain them. On this conduct, Sir, I leave you to make your own reflexions.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible (at lea&s;t I have found it im|po&s;&s;ible) to fix on the real amount of the pretended debts with which your mini&s;ters have thought proper to load the Carnatic. They are ob&s;cure; they &s;hun enquiry; they are enormous. That is all you know of them.</P>
<P>That you may judge what chance any ho|nourable and u&s;eful end of government has for a provi&s;ion that comes in for the leavings of the&s;e gluttonous demands, I mu&s;t take it on my&s;elf to bring before you the real condition of that abu&s;ed, in&s;ulted, racked, and ruined country; though in truth my mind revolts from it; though you will hear it with horror; and I confe&s;s, I tremble when I think on the&s;e awful and confounding di&s;pen&s;a|tions of Providence. I &s;hall fir&s;t trouble you with a few words as to the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The great fortunes made in India in the begin|nings of conque&s;t, naturally excited an emulation in all the parts, and through the whole &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Company's &s;ervice. But in the Company it gave ri&s;e to other &s;entiments. They did not find the new channels of acqui&s;ition flow with equal riches to them. On the contrary, the high flood-tide of private emolument was generally in the lowe&s;t ebb of their affairs. They began al&s;o to fear, that the fortune of war might take away what the fortune of war had given. Wars were accordingly di&s;couraged by repeated injunctions and menaces; and that the &s;ervants might not be bribed into them by the native princes, they were &s;trictly forbidden
<PB N="47" REF="55">
to take any money what&s;oever from their hands. But vehement pa&s;&s;ion is ingenious in re&s;ources. The Company's &s;ervants were not only &s;timulated, but better in&s;tructed by the prohibition. They &s;oon fell upon a contrivance which an&s;wered their purpo&s;es far better than the methods which were forbid|den; though in this al&s;o they violated an ancient, but they thought, an abrogated order. They rever&s;ed their proceedings. In&s;tead of receiv|ing pre&s;ents, they made loans. In&s;tead of carrying on wars in their own name, they contrived an autho|rity, at once irre&s;i&s;tible and irre&s;pon&s;ible, in who&s;e name they might ravage at plea&s;ure; and being thus freed from all re&s;traint, they indulged them&s;elves in the mo&s;t extravagant &s;peculations of plunder. The cabal of creditors who have been the object of the late bountiful grant from his Maje&s;ty's mi|ni&s;ters, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves, under the name of creditors and a&s;&s;ignees, of every country in India, as fa&s;t as it &s;hould be conquered, in&s;pired into the mind of the Nabob of Arcot (then a de|pendant on the Company of the humble&s;t order) a &s;cheme of the mo&s;t wild and de&s;perate ambition that I believe ever was admitted into the thoughts of a man &s;o &s;ituated <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Report of the Select Committee, Madras Con&s;ultations, January 7, 1771.

<P>On this &s;cheme of their &s;ervants, the Company was to appear in the Carnatic in no other light than as a contractor for the provi&s;ion of armies, and the hire of mercenaries for his u&s;e, and under his direction. This di&s;po&s;ition was to be &s;ecured by the Nabob's putting him&s;elf under the guarantee of France; and by the means of that rival nation, preventing the Engli&s;h for ever from a&s;&s;uming an equality, much le&s;s a &s;uperiority in the Carnatic. In pur&s;uance of this trea&s;onable project (trea&s;on|able on the part of the Engli&s;h) they extingui&s;hed the Company as a &s;overeign power in that part of India; they withdrew the Company's garri&s;ons out of all the forts and &s;trong holds of the Car|natic; they declined to receive the amba&s;&s;adors from foreign courts, and remitted them to the Nabob of Arcot; they fell upon, and totally de|&s;troyed the olde&s;t ally of the company, the king of Tanjore, and plundered the country to the amount of near five millions &s;terling; one after another, in the Nabob's name, but with Engli&s;h force, they brought into a mi&s;erable &s;ervitude all the princes, and great independent nobility of a va&s;t country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>The principal object of the expedition is to get money from Tanjore to pay the Nabob's debt: if a &s;urlpus, to be applied in di&s;charge of the Nabob's debts to his pri|vate creditors.</Q>

<P>Among the victims to this magnificent plan of univer&s;al plunder, worthy of the heroic avarice of the projectors, you have all heard (and he has made him&s;elf to be well remembered) of an In|dian chief called Hyder Ali Khan. This man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the we&s;tern, as the Company under the name of the Nabob of Arcot does the ea&s;tern di|vi&s;ion of the Carnatic. It was among the leading mea&s;ures in the de&s;ign of this cabal (according to their own emphatic language) to <HI>extirpate</HI> this Hyder Ali <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter from the Nabob, May 1&s;t, 1768; and ditto, 24th April 1770, 1&s;t October; ditto, 16th September 1772, 16th March 1773.</NOTE>. They declared the Nabob of Arcot to be his &s;overeign, and him&s;elf to be a rebel, and publicly inve&s;ted their in&s;trument with the &s;o|vereignty of the kingdom of My&s;ore. But their victim was not of the pa&s;&s;ive kind. They were &s;oon obliged to conclude a treaty of peace and clo&s;e alliance with this rebel, at the gates of Ma|dras. Both before and &s;ince that treaty, every principle of policy pointed out this power as a na|tural alliance; and on his part, it was courted by every &s;ort of amicable office. But the cabinet coun|cil of Engli&s;h creditors would not &s;uffer their Nabob of Arcot to &s;ign the treaty, nor even to give to a prince, at lea&s;t his equal, the ordinary titles of re|&s;pect and courte&s;y <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter from the Pre&s;idency at Madras to the Court of Directors, 27th June 1769.</NOTE>.

<P>When at length Hyder Ali found that he had to do with men who either would &s;ign no conven|tion, or whom no treaty, and no &s;ignature could bind, and who were the determined enemies of hu|man intercour&s;e it&s;elf, he decreed to make the coun|try po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the&s;e incorrigible and prede&s;tinated criminals a memorable example to mankind. He re&s;olved, in the gloomy rece&s;&s;es of a mind capa|cious of &s;uch things, to leave the whole Carnatic an everla&s;ting monument of vengeance; and to put perpetual de&s;olation as a barrier between him and tho&s;e again&s;t whom the faith which holds the moral elements of the world together was no protection. He became at length &s;o confident of his force, &s;o collected in his might, that he made no &s;ecret what&s;oever of his dreadful re&s;olution. Having terminated his di&s;putes with every enemy, and every rival, who buried their mutual animo&s;ities in their common dete&s;tation again&s;t the creditors of the Nabob of Arcot, he drew from every quarter, whatever a &s;avage ferocity could add to his new rudiments in the arts of de&s;truction; and compounding all the materials of fury, havoc, and de&s;olation, into one black cloud, he hung for a while on the declivities of the mountains. Whil&s;t the authors of all the&s;e evils were idly and &s;tupidly gazing on this menacing meteor, which blackened all their horizon, it &s;uddenly bur&s;t, and poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the Carnatic.&mdash;Then en&s;ued a &s;cene of woe, the like of which no eye had &s;een, no heart conceived, and which no tongue can adequately tell. All the
<PB N="51" REF="59">
horrors of war before known or heard of, were mercy to that new havoc. A &s;torm of univer&s;al fire bla&s;ted every field, con&s;umed every hou&s;e, de|&s;troyed every temple. The mi&s;erable inhabitants flying from their flaming villages, in part were &s;laughtered; others, without regard to &s;ex, to age, to the re&s;pect of rank, or &s;acredne&s;s of function; fathers torn from children, hu&s;bands from wives, enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry, and amid&s;t the goading &s;pears of drivers, and the trampling of pur&s;uing hor&s;es, were &s;wept into captivity, in an unknown and ho&s;tile land. Tho&s;e who were able to evade this tempe&s;t, fled to the walled cities. But e&s;caping from fire, &s;word, and exile, they fell into the jaws of famine.</P>
<P>The alms of the &s;ettlement, in this dreadful ex|igency, were certainly liberal; and all was done by charity that private charity could do: but it was a people in beggary; it was a nation which &s;tretched out its hands for food. For months together the&s;e creatures of &s;ufferance, who&s;e very exce&s;s and luxury in their mo&s;t plen|teous days, had fallen &s;hort of the allowance of our au&s;tere&s;t fa&s;ts, &s;ilent, patient, re&s;igned, with|out &s;edition or di&s;turbance, almo&s;t without com|plaint, peri&s;hed by an hundred a day in the &s;treets of Madras; every day &s;eventy at lea&s;t laid their bodies in the &s;treets, or on the glacis of Tanjore, and expired of famine in the granary of India. I was going to awake your ju&s;tice towards this un|happy part of our fellow citizens, by bringing be|fore you &s;ome of the circum&s;tances of this plague of hunger. Of all the calamities which be&s;et and waylay the life of man, this comes the neare&s;t to our heart, and is that wherein the proude&s;t of us all feels him&s;elf to be nothing more than he is: but I find my&s;elf unable to manage it with decorum; the&s;e details are of a &s;pecies of horror &s;o nau&s;eous

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix N^o 4, Report of the Committee of a&s;&s;igned Revenue.</NOTE> For eighteen months, without intermi&s;&s;ion, this de&s;truction raged from the gates of Madras to the gates of Tanjore; and &s;o compleatly did the&s;e ma&s;ters in their art, Hyder Ali, and his more fe|rocious &s;on, ab&s;olve them&s;elves of their impious vow, that when the Briti&s;h armies traver&s;ed, as they did the Carnatic for hundreds of miles in all direc|tions, through the whole line of their march they did not &s;ee one man, not one woman, not one child, not one four-footed bea&s;t of any de&s;cription whatever.

<P>The Carnatic is not by the bounty of nature a fertile &s;oil. The general &s;ize of its cattle is proof enough that it is much otherwi&s;e. It is &s;ome days &s;ince I moved, that a curious and intere&s;ting map, kept in the India Hou&s;e, &s;hould be laid before you<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Barnard's Map of the Jaghire.</NOTE>. The India Hou&s;e is not yet in readine&s;s to &s;end it; I have therefore brought down my own copy, and there it lies for the u&s;e of any gentleman who may think &s;uch a matter worthy of his attention. It is indeed a noble map, and of noble things; but it is deci&s;ive again&s;t the golden dreams and &s;an|guine &s;peculations of avarice run mad. In addition to what you know mu&s;t be the ca&s;e in every part of the world (the nece&s;&s;ity of a previous provi&s;ion of habitation, &s;eed, &s;tock, capital) that map will &s;hew you, that the u&s;e of the influences of Heaven it&s;elf, are in that country a work of art. The Carnatic is refre&s;hed by few or no living brooks or running &s;treams, and it has rain only at a &s;ea&s;on; but its product of rice exacts the u&s;e of water &s;ubject to perpetual command. This is the national bank of the Carnatic, on which it mu&s;t have a perpetual credit, or it peri&s;hes irre|trievably. For that rea&s;on, in the happier times of India, a number almo&s;t incredible of re&s;ervoirs have been made in cho&s;en places throughout the whole country; they are formed, for the greater
<PB N="55" REF="63">
part, of mounds of earth and &s;tones, with &s;luices of &s;olid ma&s;onry; the whole con&s;tructed with admi|rable &s;kill and labour, and maintained at a mighty charge. In the territory contained in that map alone, I have been at the trouble of reckoning the re&s;ervoirs, and they amount to upwards of eleven hundred, from the extent of two or three acres to five miles in circuit. From the&s;e re&s;ervoirs cur|rents are occa&s;ionally drawn over the fields, and the&s;e watercour&s;es again call for a con&s;iderable ex|pence to keep them properly &s;coured and duly le|velled. Taking the di&s;trict in that map as a mea|&s;ure, there cannot be in the Carnatic and Tanjore fewer than ten thou&s;and of the&s;e re&s;ervoirs of the larger and middling dimen&s;ions, to &s;ay nothing of tho&s;e for dome&s;tic &s;ervices, and the u&s;e of reli|gious purification. The&s;e are not the enterprizes of your power, nor in a &s;tyle of magnificence &s;uited to the ta&s;te of your mini&s;ter. The&s;e are the monu|ments of real kings, who were the fathers of their people; te&s;tators to a po&s;terity which they embraced as their own. The&s;e are the grand &s;epulchres built by ambition; but by the ambition of an un&s;atiable benevolence, which, not contented with reigning in the di&s;pen&s;ation of happine&s;s during the con|tracted term of human life, had &s;trained, with all the reachings and gra&s;pings of a vivacious mind, to ex|tend the dominion of their bounty beyond the limits of nature, and to perpetuate them&s;elves through generations of generations, the guardians, the pro|tectors, the nouri&s;hers of mankind.</P>

the entry of a cruel foreign foe into the coun|try, he did not leave it until his revenge had compleated the de&s;truction begun by their avarice. Few, very few indeed, of the&s;e magazines of water that are not either totally de&s;troyed, or cut through with &s;uch gaps, as to require a &s;erious attention and much co&s;t to re-e&s;tabli&s;h them, as the means of pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the people, and of future revenue to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>What, Sir, would a virtuous and enlightened mini&s;try do on the view of the ruins of &s;uch works before them? on the view of &s;uch a cha&s;m of de|&s;olation as that which yawned in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e countries to the north and &s;outh, which &s;till bore &s;ome ve&s;tiges of cultivation? They would have re|duced all their mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary e&s;tabli&s;hments; they would have &s;u&s;pended the ju&s;te&s;t payments; they would have employed every &s;hilling derived from the producing to reanimate the powers of the un|productive parts. While they were performing this fundamental duty, whil&s;t they were celebrat|ing the&s;e my&s;teries of ju&s;tice and humanity, they would have told the corps of fictitious creditors, who&s;e crimes were their claims, that they mu&s;t keep an awful di&s;tance; that they mu&s;t &s;ilence their inau&s;picious tongues; that they mu&s;t hold off their profane unhallowed paws from this holy work; they would have proclaimed with a voice that &s;hould make it&s;elf heard, that on every coun|try the fir&s;t creditor is the plow; that this ori|ginal, indefea&s;ible claim &s;uper&s;edes every other de|mand.</P>
<P>This is what a wi&s;e and virtuous mini&s;try would have done and &s;aid. This, therefore, is what our mini&s;ter could never think of &s;aying or doing. A mini&s;try of another kind would have fir&s;t im|proved the country, and have thus laid a &s;olid
<PB N="57" REF="65">
foundation for future opulence and future force. But on this grand point of the re&s;toration of the country, there is not one &s;yllable to be found in the corre&s;pondence of our mini&s;ters, from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t: they felt nothing for a land de&s;olat|ed by fire, &s;word, and famine; their &s;ympathies took another direction; they were touched with pity for bribery, &s;o long tormented with a fruit|le&s;s itching of its palms; their bowels yearned for u&s;ury, that had long mi&s;&s;ed the harve&s;t of its returning months <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Intere&s;t is rated in India by the mouth.</NOTE>; they felt for peculation which had been for &s;o many years raking in the du&s;t of an empty trea&s;ury; they were melted into compa&s;|&s;ion for rapine and oppre&s;&s;ion, licking their dry, parched, unbloody jaws. The&s;e were the objects of their &s;olicitude. The&s;e were the nece&s;&s;ities for which they were &s;tudious to provide.</P>
<P>To &s;tate the country and its revenues in their real condition, and to provide for tho&s;e fictitious claims, con&s;i&s;tently with the &s;upport of an army and a civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, would have been impo&s;&s;i|ble; therefore the mini&s;ters are &s;ilent on that head, and re&s;t them&s;elves on the authority of lord Ma|cartney, who in a letter to the Court of Directors, written in the year 1781, &s;peculating on what might be the re&s;ult of a wi&s;e management of the countries a&s;&s;igned by the Nabob of Arcot, rates the revenues as in time of peace, at twelve hundred thou&s;and pound a year, as he does tho&s;e of the king of Tanjore (which had not been a&s;&s;igned) at four hundred and fifty. On this lord Macartney grounds his calculations, and on this they choo&s;e to ground theirs. It was on this calculation that the mini&s;try, in direct oppo&s;ition to the remon|&s;trances of the Court of Directors, have compelled that mi&s;erable, en&s;laved body, to put their hands
<PB N="58" REF="66">
to an order for appropriating the enormous &s;um of &pound;. 480,000 annually, as a fund for paying to their rebellious &s;ervants a debt contracted in defiance of their cleare&s;t and mo&s;t po&s;itive injunctions.</P>
<P>The authority and information of Lord Macart|ney is held high on this occa&s;ion, though it is to|tally rejected in every other particular of this bu&s;i|ne&s;s. I believe I have the honour of being almo&s;t as old an acquaintance as any Lord Macartney has. A con&s;tant and unbroken friend&s;hip has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us from a very early period; and, I tru&s;t, he thinks, that as I re&s;pect his character, and in general admire his conduct, I am one of tho&s;e who feel no common intere&s;t in his reputation. Yet I do not he&s;itate wholly to di&s;allow the cal|culation of 1781, without any apprehen&s;ion, that I &s;hall appear to di&s;tru&s;t his veracity or his judgment. This peace e&s;timate of revenue was not ground|ed on the &s;tate of the Carnatic as it then, or as it had recently &s;tood. It was a &s;tatement of former and better times. There is no doubt, that a pe|riod did exi&s;t, when the large portion of the Car|natic held by the Nabob of Arcot might be fairly reputed to produce a revenue to that, or to a great|er amount. But the whole had &s;o melted away by the &s;low and &s;ilent ho&s;tility of oppre&s;&s;ion and mi&s;|management, that the revenues, &s;inking with the pro&s;perity of the country, had fallen to about &pound;. 800,000 a year, even before an enemy's hor&s;e had imprinted his hoof on the &s;oil of the Carnatic. From that view, and independently of the deci&s;ive effects of the war which en&s;ued, Sir Eyre Coote conceived that years mu&s;t pa&s;s before the country could be re&s;tored to its former pro&s;perity and pro|duction. It was that &s;tate of revenue, (namely, the actual &s;tate before the war) which the Directors have oppo&s;ed to Lord Macartney's &s;peculation. They refu&s;e to take the revenues for more than
<PB N="59" REF="67">
&pound;. 800,000. In this they are ju&s;tified by Lord Macartney him&s;elf, who, in a &s;ub&s;equent letter, in|forms the Court, that his &s;ketch is a matter of &s;pe|culation; it &s;uppo&s;es the country re&s;tored to its antient pro&s;perity, and the revenue to be in a cour&s;e of effective and hone&s;t collection. If there|fore the mini&s;ters have gone wrong, they were not deceived by Lord Macartney: they were deceived by no man. The e&s;timate of the Directors is nearly the very e&s;timate furni&s;hed by the right honourable gentleman him&s;elf, and publi&s;hed to the world in one of the printed Reports of his own Committee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas's Committee, Rep. I. p. 9; and ditto, Rep. IV. 69. where the revenue of 1777 &s;tated only at 22 lacks &mdash;30 lacks &s;tated as the revenue,
<Q><HI>&s;uppo&s;ing</HI> the Carnatic to be <HI>properly</HI> managed.</Q></NOTE>; but as &s;oon as he obtained his power, he cho&s;e to abandon his account. No part of his official conduct can be defended on the ground of his parliamentary information.</P>
<P>In this cla&s;hing of accounts and e&s;timates, ought not the mini&s;try, if they wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve even appearances, to have waited for information of the actual re&s;ult of the&s;e &s;peculations, before they laid a charge, and &s;uch a charge, not condi|tionally and eventually, but po&s;itively and authori|tatively, upon a country which they all knew, and which one of them had regi&s;tered on the records of this Hou&s;e, to be wa&s;ted beyond all example, by every oppre&s;&s;ion of an abu&s;ive government, and every ravage of a de&s;olating war. But that you may di&s;cern in what manner they u&s;e the corre&s;pondence of office, and that thereby you may enter into the true &s;pirit of the mini&s;terial Board of Control, I de&s;ire you, Mr. Speaker, to remark, that through their whole controver&s;y with the Court of Directors, they do not &s;o much as hint at their ever having &s;een any other paper from lord Macartney, or any other
<PB N="60" REF="68">
e&s;timate of revenue, than this of 1781. To this they hold. Here they take po&s;t; here they en|trench them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t read this curious controver&s;y be|tween the mini&s;terial Board and the Court of Di|rectors, common candour obliged me to attribute their tenacious adherence to the e&s;timate of 1781, to a total ignorance of what had appeared upon the records. But the right honourable gentleman has cho&s;en to come forward with an uncalled-for de|claration; he boa&s;tingly tells you, that he has &s;een, read, dige&s;ted, compared every thing; and that if he has &s;inned, he has &s;inned with his eyes broad open. Since then the mini&s;ters will ob&s;tinately &s;hut the gates of mercy on them&s;elves, let them add to their crimes what aggravations they plea&s;e. They have then (&s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o) wilfully and corrupt|ly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the information which they ought to have produced; and for the &s;upport of peculation, have made them&s;elves guilty of &s;poliation and &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of evidence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix N^o 4, Statement in the Report of the Committee of a&s;&s;igned Revenue.</NOTE>. The paper I hold in my hand, which totally overturns (for the pre&s;ent at lea&s;t) the e&s;timate of 1781, they have no more taken notice of in their controver&s;y with the Court of Directors than if it had no exi&s;t|ence. It is the Report made by a Committee appointed at Madras, to manage the whole of the &s;ix countries a&s;&s;igned to the Company by the Nabob of Arcot. This Committee was wi&s;ely in&s;tituted by Lord Macartney, to remove from him&s;elf the &s;u&s;|picion of all improper management in &s;o invidious a tru&s;t; and it &s;eems to have been well cho&s;en. This Committee has made a comparative e&s;timate of the only &s;ix di&s;tricts which were in a condition to be let to farm. In one &s;et of columns they &s;tate the gro&s;s and net produce of the di&s;tricts as let
<PB N="61" REF="69">
by the Nabob. To that &s;tatement they oppo&s;e the terms on which the &s;ame di&s;tricts were rented for five years, under their authority. Under the Nabob, the gro&s;s farm was &s;o high as &pound;. 570,000 &s;terling. What was the clear produce? Why, no more than about &pound;. 250,000; and this was the whole profit to the Nabob's trea&s;ury, under his own management, of all the di&s;tricts which were in a condition to be let to farm on the 27th of May 1782. Lord Macartney's lea&s;es &s;tipulated a gro&s;s produce of no more than about &pound;. 530,000: But then the e&s;timated net amount was nearly double the Nabob's. It how|ever did not then exceed &pound;. 480,000; and lord Ma|cartney's commi&s;&s;ioners take credit for an annual revenue amounting to this clear &s;um. Here is no &s;peculation; here is no inaccurate account clande&s;|tinely obtained from tho&s;e who might wi&s;h, and were enabled to deceive. It is the authorized re|corded &s;tate of a real recent tran&s;action. Here is not twelve hundred thou&s;and pound, not eight hun|dred. The whole revenue of the Carnatic yielded no more in May 1782 than four hundred and eighty thou&s;and pounds; nearly the very preci&s;e &s;um which your mini&s;ter, who is &s;o careful of the public &s;ecurity, has carried from all de&s;criptions of e&s;ta|bli&s;hment to form a fund for the private emolu|ment of his creatures.</P>
<P>In this e&s;timate, we &s;ee, as I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, the Nabob's farms rated &s;o high as &pound;. 570,000. Hitherto all is well; but follow on to the effective net revenue: there the illu&s;ion vani&s;hes; and you will not find nearly &s;o much as half the pro|duce. It is with rea&s;on therefore lord Macartney invariably throughout the whole corre&s;pondence, qualifies all his views and expectations of re|venue, and all his plans for its application, with this indi&s;pen&s;able condition, that the management is not in the hands of the Nabob of Arcot. Should
<PB N="62" REF="70">
that fatal mea&s;ure take place, he has over and over again told you, that he has no pro&s;pect of realizing any thing what&s;oever for any public purpo&s;e. With the&s;e weighty declarations, confirmed by &s;uch a &s;tate of indi&s;putable fact before them; what has been done by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his accomplices? Shall I be believed? They have de|livered over tho&s;e very territories, on the keeping of which in the hands of the Committee, the de|fence of our dominions, and what was more dear to them, po&s;&s;ibly, their own job depended; they have delivered back again without condition, without arrangement, without &s;tipulation of any &s;ort for the natives of any rank, the whole of tho&s;e va&s;t countries, to many of which he had no ju&s;t claim, into the ruinous mi&s;management of the Nabob of Arcot. To crown all, according to their mi&s;erable practice whenever they do any thing tran&s;cendent|ly ab&s;urd, they preface this their abdication of their tru&s;t, by a &s;olemn declaration that they were not obliged to it by any principle of policy, or any de|mand of ju&s;tice what&s;oever.</P>
<P>I have &s;tated to you the e&s;timated produce of the territories of the Carnatic, in a condition to be farm|ed in 1782, according to the different managements into which they might fall; and this e&s;timate the mini&s;ters have thought proper to &s;uppre&s;s. Since that, two other accounts have been received. The fir&s;t informs us, that there has been a recovery of what is called arrear, as well as of an improvement of the revenue of one of the &s;ix provinces which were let in 1782 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Province of Tinnevelly.</NOTE>. It was brought about by making a new war. After &s;ome &s;harp actions, by the re&s;olution and &s;kill of Colonel Fullarton, &s;everal of the petty princes of the mo&s;t &s;outherly of the unwa&s;ted pro|vinces were compelled to pay very heavy rents and
<PB N="63" REF="71">
tributes, who for a long time before had not paid any acknowledgment. After this reduction, by the care of Mr. Irwin, one of the Committee, that province was divided into twelve farms. This ope|ration rai&s;ed the income of that particular province; the others remain as they were fir&s;t farmed. So that in&s;tead of producing only their original rent of &pound;. 480,000, they netted in about two years and a quarter &pound;. 1,320,000 &s;terling, which would be about &pound;. 660,000 a year, if the recovered arrear was not included. What deduction is to be made on account of that arrear I cannot determine, but certainly what would reduce the annual income con&s;iderably below the rate I have allowed.</P>
<P>The &s;econd account received, is the letting of the wa&s;ted provinces of the Carnatic. This I un|der&s;tand is at a growing rent, which may or may not reali&s;e what it promi&s;es; but if it &s;hould an|&s;wer, it will rai&s;e the whole, at &s;ome future time, to &pound;. 1,200,000.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t here remark, Mr. Speaker, that this revenue is the produce of <HI>all</HI> the Nabob's do|minions. During the a&s;&s;ignment, the Nabob paid nothing, becau&s;e the Company had all. Suppo&s;ing the whole of the lately a&s;&s;igned territory to yield up to the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of the right ho|nourable gentleman; and &s;uppo&s;e &pound;. 1,200,000 to be annually realized (of which we actually know of no more than the realizing of &s;ix hundred thou|&s;and) out of this you mu&s;t deduct the &s;ub&s;idy and rent which the Nabob paid before the a&s;&s;ignment, namely, &pound;. 340,000 a year. This reduces back the revenue applicable to the new di&s;tribution made by his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, to about &pound;. 800,000. Of that &s;um five-eighths are by them &s;urrendered to the debts. The remaining three are the only fund left for all the purpo&s;es &s;o magnificently di&s;played in the letter of the Board of Control; that is for
<PB N="64" REF="72">
a new-ca&s;t peace e&s;tabli&s;hment; a new fund for ord|nance and fortifications; and a large allowance for what they call "the &s;plendour of the Durbar."</P>
<P>You have heard the account of the&s;e territories as they &s;tood in 1782. You have &s;een the <HI>actual</HI> re|ceipt &s;ince the a&s;&s;ignment in 1781, of which I reckon about two years and a quarter productive. I have &s;tated to you the expectation from the wa&s;ted part. For realizing all this, you may value your&s;elves on the vigour and diligence of a Gover|nor and Committee that have done &s;o much. If the&s;e hopes from the Committee are rational&mdash;re|member that the Committee is no more. Your Mini&s;ters, who have formed their fund for the&s;e debts on the pre&s;umed effect of the Committee's ma|nagement, have put a complete end to that Com|mittee. Their acts are re&s;cinded; their lea&s;es are broken; their renters are di&s;per&s;ed. Your Mini&s;|ters knew when they &s;igned the death-warrant of the Carnatic, that the Nabob would not only turn all the&s;e unfortunate farmers of revenue out of employ|ment, but that he has denounced his &s;evere&s;t ven|geance again&s;t them, for acting under Briti&s;h au|thority. With a knowledge of this di&s;po&s;ition, a Bri|ti&s;h Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Trea&s;urer of the Navy, incited by no public advantage, impelled by no public nece&s;&s;ity, in a &s;train of the mo&s;t wan|ton perfidy which has ever &s;tained the annals of mankind, have delivered over to plunder, impri&s;on|ment, exile, and death it&s;elf, according to the mercy of &s;uch execrable tyrants as Amir al Omra and Paul Benfield, the unhappy and deluded &s;ouls, who, un|taught by uniform example, were &s;till weak enough to put their tru&s;t in Engli&s;h faith <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix N^o 5; and for the peculiar hard&s;hip of one of the ca&s;es, N^o</NOTE>. They have gone farther; they have thought proper to mock
<PB N="65" REF="73">
and outrage their mi&s;ery by ordering them protec|tion and compen&s;ation. From what power is this protection to be derived? and from what fund is this compen&s;ation to ari&s;e? The revenues are delivered over to their oppre&s;&s;or; the territorial juri&s;diction, from whence that revenue is to ari&s;e, and under which they live, is &s;urrendered to the &s;ame iron hands: and that they &s;hall be deprived of all refuge, and all hope, the Mini&s;ter has made a &s;olemn, voluntary declaration, that he never will interfere with the Nabob's internal government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Extract of their Letter in the Appendix, N^o 6 A.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The la&s;t thing con&s;idered by the Board of Con|trol among the debts of the Carnatic, was that ari&s;ing to the Ea&s;t India Company, which after the provi&s;ion for the cavalry, and the con&s;olidation of 1777, was to divide the re&s;idue of the fund of &pound;. 480,000 a year with the lenders of 1767. This debt the worthy Chairman, who &s;its oppo&s;ite to me, contends to be three millions &s;terling. Lord Ma|cartney's account of 1781, &s;tates it to be at that pe|riod &pound;. 1,200,000. The fir&s;t account of the Court of Directors makes it &pound;. 900,000. This, like the private debt, being without any &s;olid exi&s;tence, is incapable of any di&s;tinct limits. Whatever its amount or its validity may be, one thing is clear; it is of the nature and quality of a public debt. In that light nothing is provided for it, but an eventual &s;urplus to be divided with one cla&s;s of the private demands, after &s;atisfying the two fir&s;t cla&s;&s;es. Never was a more &s;hameful po&s;tponing a public demand, which by the rea&s;on of the thing, and the uniform practice of all na|tions, &s;uper&s;edes every private claim.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who gave this preference to private claims, con&s;ider the Company's as a lawful de|mand;
<PB N="66" REF="74">
el&s;e, why did they pretend to provide for it? On their own principles they are condemned.</P>
<P>But I, Sir, who profe&s;s to &s;peak to your under|&s;tanding and to your con&s;cience, and to bru&s;h away from this bu&s;ine&s;s all fal&s;e colours, all fal&s;e appellations, as well as fal&s;e facts, do po&s;itively deny that the Carnatic owes a &s;hilling to the Com|pany; whatever the Company may be indebted to that undone country. It owes nothing to the Company, for this plain and &s;imple rea&s;on&mdash;The territory charged with the debt is their own. To &s;ay that their revenues fall &s;hort, and owe them money, is to &s;ay they are in debt to them&s;elves, which is only talking non&s;en&s;e. The fact is, that by the inva&s;ion of an enemy, and the ruin of the country, the Company, either in its own name or in the names of the Nabob of Arcot and Rajah of Tanjore, has lo&s;t for &s;everal years what it might have looked to receive from its own e&s;tate. If men were allowed to credit them&s;elves, upon &s;uch prin|ciples any one might &s;oon grow rich by this mode of accounting. A flood comes down upon a man's e&s;tate in the Bedford Level of a thou&s;and pounds a year, and drowns his rents for ten years. The Chancellor would put that man into the hands of a tru&s;tee, who would gravely make up his books, and for this lo&s;s credit him&s;elf in his account for a debt due to him of &pound;. 10,000. It is, how|ever, on this principle the Company makes up its demands on the Carnatic. In peace they go the full length, and indeed more than the full length, of what the people can bear for current e&s;tabli&s;hments; then they are ab&s;urd enough to con&s;olidate all the calamities of war into debts; to metamorpho&s;e the deva&s;tations of the country into demands upon its future production. What is this but to avow a re&s;olution utterly to de&s;troy their own country, and to force the people to pay for
<PB N="67" REF="75">
their &s;ufferings, to a government which has proved unable to protect either the &s;hare of the hu&s;hand|man or their own? In every lea&s;e of a farm, the inva&s;ion of an enemy, in&s;tead of forming a de|mand for arrear, is a relea&s;e of rent; nor for that relea&s;e is it at all nece&s;&s;ary to &s;how, that the inva|&s;ion has left nothing to the occupier of the &s;oil; though in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it would be too ea&s;y to prove that melancholy fact<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>It is certain that the incur&s;ion of a <HI>few</HI> of Hyder's hor&s;e into the Jaghire, in 1767, co&s;t the Company upwards of Pagodas 27,000, <HI>in allowances for damages.</HI></Q> Con&s;ul|tations, February 11th, 1771.</NOTE>. I therefore ap|plauded my right honourable friend, who, when he canva&s;&s;ed the Company's accounts, as a prelimi|nary to a bill that ought not to &s;tand on fal&s;ehood of any kind, fixed his di&s;cerning eye, and his de|ciding hand, on the&s;e debts of the Company, from the Nabob of Arcot and Rajah of Tanjore, and at one &s;troke expunged them all, as utterly irrecove|rable; he might have added as utterly unfounded.</P>
<P>On the&s;e grounds I do not blame the arrange|ment this day in que&s;tion, as a preference given to the debt of individuals over the Company's debt. In my eye it is no more than the preference of a fiction over a chimera; but I blame the preference given to tho&s;e fictitious private debts, over the &s;tanding de|fence and the &s;tanding government. It is there the public is robbed. It is robbed in its army; it is robbed in its civil admini&s;tration; it is robbed in its credit; it is robbed in its inve&s;tment which forms the commercial connection between that country and Europe. There is the robbery.</P>
<P>But my principal objection lies a good deal deeper. That debt to the Company is the pretext under which all the other debts lurk and cover them&s;elves. That debt forms the foul putrid mucus, in which are engendered the whole brood of creeping a&s;carides,
<PB N="68" REF="76">

It is nece&s;&s;ary, Sir, you &s;hould recollect two things: Fir&s;t, that the Nabob's debt to the Company carries no intere&s;t.

Then &s;teps forward &s;ome Paul Benfield, and from his grateful com|pa&s;&s;ion to the Nabob, and his filial regard to the Company, he unlocks the trea&s;ures of his virtuous indu&s;try; and for a con&s;ideration of twenty-four or thirty-&s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI> on a mortgage of the territorial revenue, becomes &s;ecurity to the Company for the Nabob's arrear.</P>
<P>All this intermediate u&s;ury thus becomes &s;anc|tified by the ultimate view to the Company's pay|ment. In this ca&s;e, would not a plain man a&s;k this plain que&s;tion of the Company; If you know that the Nabob mu&s;t annually mortgage his ter|ritories to your &s;ervants, to pay his annual arrear to you, why is not the a&s;&s;ignment or mortgage made directly to the Company it&s;elf? By this &s;imple obvious operation, the Company would
<PB N="69" REF="77">
be relieved and the debt paid, without the charge of a &s;hilling intere&s;t to that prince. But if that cour&s;e &s;hould be thought too indulgent, why do they not take that a&s;&s;ignment with &s;uch intere&s;t to them&s;elves as they pay to others, that is eight <HI>per cent.?</HI> Or if it were thought more advi&s;eable (why it &s;hould I know not) that he mu&s;t borrow, why do not the Company lend their own credit to the Nabob for their own payment? That credit would not be weakened by the collateral &s;ecurity of his territorial mortgage. The money might &s;till be had at eight <HI>per cent.</HI> In&s;tead of any of the&s;e hone&s;t and obvious methods, the Company has for years kept up a &s;hew of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and mo|deration, by &s;uffering a debt to accumulate to them from the country powers without any intere&s;t at all; and at the &s;ame time have &s;een before their eyes, on a pretext of borrowing to pay that debt, the revenues of the country charged with an u&s;ury of twenty, twenty-four, thirty-&s;ix, and even eight-and-forty <HI>per cent.</HI> with compound intere&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, E.</NOTE>, for the benefit of their &s;ervants. All this time they know that by having a debt &s;ub&s;i&s;ting without any in|tere&s;t, which is to be paid by contracting a debt on the highe&s;t intere&s;t, they manife&s;tly render it nece&s;&s;ary to the Nabob of Arcot to give the pri|vate demand a preference to the public; and by binding him and their &s;ervants together in a com|mon cau&s;e, they enable him to form a party to the utter ruin of their own authority, and their own affairs. Thus their fal&s;e moderation, and their affected purity, by the natural operation of every thing fal&s;e, and every thing affected, becomes pan|der and bawd to the unbridled debauchery and li|centious lewdne&s;s of u&s;ury and extortion.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this double game, all the ter|ritorial

Do not think I paint. Far,
<PB N="71" REF="79">
very far from it; I do not reach the fact, nor approach to it. Men of re&s;pectable condition, men equal to your &s;ub&s;tantial Engli&s;h yeomen, are daily tied up and &s;courged to an&s;wer the multiplied demands of various contending and contradictory titles, all i&s;&s;uing from one and the &s;ame &s;ource. Tyrannous exaction brings on &s;ervile concealment; and that again calls forth tyrannous coercion. They move in a circle, mutually producing and produced; till at length nothing of humanity is left in the government, no trace of integrity, &s;pirit, or manline&s;s in the people, who drag out a precarious and degraded exi&s;tence under this &s;y&s;tem of outrage upon human nature. Such is the effect of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a debt to the Company, as it has hitherto been managed, and as it ever will remain, until ideas are adopted totally different from tho&s;e which prevail at this time.</P>
<P>Your worthy mini&s;ters, &s;upporting what they are obliged to condemn, have thought fit to renew the Company's old order again&s;t contracting private debts in future. They begin by rewarding the vio|lation of the antient law; and then they gravely re-enact provi&s;ions, of which they have given bounties for the breach. This incon&s;i&s;tency has been well expo&s;ed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Mr. Fox's Speech.</NOTE>. But what will you &s;ay to their having gone the length of giving po&s;itive directions for contracting the debt which they po&s;itively for|bid?</P>
<P>I will explain my&s;elf. They order the Nabob, out of the revenues of the Carnatic, to allot four hundred and eighty thou&s;and pounds a year, as a fund for the debts before us. For the punctual payment of this annuity, they order him to give <HI>&s;oucar</HI> &s;ecurity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The amended Letter, Appendix N^o 6 B.</NOTE>. When a <HI>&s;oucar,</HI> that is a money
<PB N="72" REF="80">
dealer, becomes &s;ecurity for any native prince, the cour&s;e is, for the native prince to counter&s;ecure the money dealer, by making over to him in mortgage a portion of his territory, equal to the &s;um annually to be paid, with an intere&s;t of at lea&s;t twenty-four <HI>per cent.</HI> The point fit for the Hou&s;e to know is, who are the&s;e &s;oucars, to whom this &s;ecurity on the revenues in favour of the Nabob's creditors is to be given? The majority of the Hou&s;e, unaccu&s;tomed to the&s;e tran&s;actions, will hear with a&s;toni&s;hment that the&s;e &s;oucars are no other than the creditors them&s;elves. The Mini&s;ter, not content with au|thorizing the&s;e tran&s;actions in a manner and to an extent unhoped for by the rapacious expectations of u&s;ury it&s;elf, loads the broken back of the Indian revenues, in favour of his worthy friends the &s;ou|cars, with an additional twenty-four <HI>per cent.</HI> for being &s;ecurity to them&s;elves for their own claims; for conde&s;cending to take the country in mortgage, to pay to them&s;elves the fruits of their own ex|tortions.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t to be paid for this &s;ecurity, accord|ing to the mo&s;t moderate &s;train of &s;oucar de|mand, comes to one hundred and eighteen thou&s;and pounds a year, which added to the &pound;.480,000 on which it is to accrue, will make the whole charge on account of the&s;e debts on the Carnatic revenues amount to &pound;.598,000 a year, as much as even a long peace will enable tho&s;e revenues to produce. Can any one reflect for a moment on all tho&s;e claims of debt, which the Mini&s;ter exhau&s;ts him&s;elf in con|trivances to augment with new u&s;uries, without lifting up his hands and eyes in a&s;toni&s;hment of the impudence, both of the claim and the adjudication? Services of &s;ome kind or other the&s;e &s;ervants of the Company mu&s;t have done, &s;o great and eminent, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer cannot think that all they have brought home is half enough.
<PB N="73" REF="81">
He halloos after them,
<Q>Gentlemen, you have forgot a large packet behind you, in your hurry; you have not &s;ufficiently recovered your&s;elves; you ought to have, and you &s;hall have, intere&s;t upon intere&s;t, upon a prohibited debt that is made up of intere&s;t upon intere&s;t. Even this is too little. I have thought of another charac|ter for you, by which you may add &s;omething to your gains; you &s;hall be &s;ecurity to your&s;elves; and hence will ri&s;e a new u&s;ury, which &s;hall efface the memory of all the u&s;uries &s;ugge&s;ted to you by your own dull inventions.</Q></P>
<P>I have done with the arrangement relative to the Carnatic. After this it is to little purpo&s;e to ob|&s;erve on what the Mini&s;ters have done to Tanjore. Your Mini&s;ters have not ob&s;erved even form and ceremony in their outrageous and in&s;ulting robbery of that country, who&s;e only crime has been, its early and con&s;tant adherence to the power of this, and the &s;uffering of an uniform pillage in con&s;equence of it. The debt of the Company from the Rajah of Tanjore, is ju&s;t of the &s;ame &s;tuff with that of the Nabob of Arcot.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;idy from Tanjore, on the arrear of which this pretended debt (if any there be) has accrued to the Company, is not, like that paid by the Nabob of Arcot, a compen&s;ation for va&s;t countries obtained, augmented, and pre&s;erved for him; not the price of pillaged trea&s;uries, ran|&s;acked hou&s;es, and plundered territories.&mdash;It is a large grant, from a &s;mall kingdom not obtained by our arms; robbed, not protected by our pow|er; a grant for which no equivalent was ever given, or pretended to be given. The right honourable Gentleman, however, bears witne&s;s in his Reports to the punctuality of the pay|ments of this grant of bounty, or, if you plea&s;e, of fear. It amounts to one hundred and &s;ixty thou|&s;and
<PB N="74" REF="82">
pound &s;terling net annual &s;ub&s;idy. He bears witne&s;s to a further grant of a town and port, with an annexed di&s;trict of thirty thou&s;and pound a year, &s;urrendered to the Company &s;ince the fir&s;t donation. He has not borne witne&s;s, but the fact is, (he will not deny it) that in the mid&s;t of war, and during the ruin and de&s;olation of a con&s;ider|able part of his territories, this prince made many very large payments. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e me|rits and &s;ervices, the fir&s;t regulation of mini&s;try is to force from him a territory of an extent which they have not yet thought proper to a&s;certain, for a military peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, the particulars of which they have not yet been plea&s;ed to &s;ettle.</P>
<P>The next part of their arrangement is with re|gard to war. As confe&s;&s;edly this prince had no &s;hare in &s;tirring up any of the former wars, &s;o all future wars are completely out of his power; for he has no troops whatever, and is under a &s;tipu|lation not &s;o much as to corre&s;pond with any fo|reign &s;tate, except through the Company. Yet, in ca&s;e the Company's &s;ervants &s;hould be again involved in war, or &s;hould think proper again to provoke any enemy, as in times pa&s;t they have wantonly provoked all India, he is to be &s;ubjected to a new penalty. To what penalty?&mdash;Why, to no le&s;s than the confi&s;cation of all his revenues. But this is to end with the war, and they are to be faithfully returned?&mdash;Oh! no; nothing like it. The country is to remain under confi&s;cation until all the debt which the Company &s;hall think fit to incur in &s;uch war &s;hall be di&s;charged; that is to &s;ay, for ever. His &s;ole comfort is to find his old enemy, the Nabob of Arcot, placed in the very &s;ame con|dition.</P>
<P>The revenues of that mi&s;erable country were, before the inva&s;ion of Hyder, reduced to a <HI>gro&s;s</HI> annual receipt of three hundred and &s;ixty thou|&s;and
<PB N="75" REF="83">
pound <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Petrie's evidence before the Select Committee, App.</NOTE>. From this receipt the &s;ub&s;idy I have ju&s;t &s;tated is taken. This again, by payments in advance, by extorting depo&s;its of additional &s;ums to a va&s;t amount for the benefit of their &s;oucars, and by an endle&s;s variety of other extortions, pub|lic and private, is loaded with a debt, the amount of which I never could a&s;certain, but which is large undoubtedly, generating an u&s;ury the mo&s;t completely ruinous that probably was ever heard of; <HI>that is, forty-eight per cent, payable monthly, with compound intere&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Appendix, N^o. 8</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;tate to which the Company's &s;ervants have reduced that country. Now come the re|formers, re&s;torers, and comforters of India. What have they done? In addition to all the&s;e tyrannous exactions with all the&s;e ruinous debts in their train, looking to one &s;ide of an agreement whil&s;t they wilfully &s;hut their eyes to the other, they withdraw from Tanjore all the benefits of the treaty of 1762, and they &s;ubject that nation to a perpetual tribute of forty thou&s;and a year to the Nabob of Arcot; a tribute never due, or pretended to be due to <HI>him,</HI> even when he appeared to be &s;omething; a tribute, as things now &s;tand, not to a real potentate, but to a &s;hadow, a dream, an incubus of oppre&s;&s;ion. Af|ter the Company has accepted in &s;ub&s;idy, in grant of territory, in remi&s;&s;ion of rent, as a compen&s;ation for their own protection, at lea&s;t two hundred thou&s;and pound a year, without di&s;counting a &s;hil|ling for that receipt, the Mini&s;ters condemn this hara&s;&s;ed nation to be tributary to a per&s;on who is him&s;elf, by their own arrangement, deprived of the right of war or peace; deprived of the power of the &s;word; forbid to keep up a &s;ingle regiment of &s;oldiers; and is therefore wholly di&s;abled from all
<PB N="76" REF="84">
protection of the country which is the object of the pretended tribute. Tribute hangs on the &s;word. It is an incident in&s;eparable from real &s;o|vereign power. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e its exi&s;tence, is as ab&s;urd as it is cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive. And here, Mr. Speaker, you have a clear exem|plification of the u&s;e of tho&s;e fal&s;e names, and fal&s;e colours, which the Gentlemen who have lately taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of India choo&s;e to lay on for the purpo&s;e of di&s;gui&s;ing their plan of oppre&s;&s;ion. The Nabob of Arcot, and Rajah of Tanjore, have, in truth and &s;ub&s;tance, no more than a merely civil authority, held in the mo&s;t entire dependence on the Company. The Nabob, without military, with|out federal capacity, is extingui&s;hed as a poten|tate; but then he is carefully kept alive as an in|dependent and &s;overeign power, for the purpo&s;e of rapine and extortion; for the purpo&s;e of perpetuat|ing the old intrigues, animo&s;ities, u&s;uries, and cor|ruptions.</P>
<P>It was not enough that this mockery of tribute, was to be continued without the corre&s;pondent protection, or any of the &s;tipulated equivalents, but ten years of arrear, to the amount of &pound;. 400,000 &s;terling, is added to all the debts to the Company, and to individuals, in order to create a new debt, to be paid (if at all po&s;&s;ible to be paid in whole or in part) only by new u&s;uries; and all this for the Nabob of Arcot, or rather for Mr. Benfield, and the corps of the Nabob's creditors, and their &s;ou|cars. Thus the&s;e mi&s;erable Indian princes are con|tinued in their &s;eats, for no other purpo&s;e than to render them in the fir&s;t in&s;tance objects of every &s;pecies of extortion; and in the &s;econd, to force them to become, for the &s;ake of a momentary &s;hadow of reduced authority, a &s;ort of &s;ubordinate tyrants, the ruin and calamity, not the fathers and cheri&s;hers, of their people.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="85">But take this tribute only as a mere charge (without title, cau&s;e, or equivalent) on this people; what one &s;tep has been taken to furni&s;h grounds for a ju&s;t calculation and e&s;timate of the proportion of the burthen and the ability? None; not an at|tempt at it. They do not adapt the burthen to the &s;trength; but they e&s;timate the &s;trength of the bearers by the burthen they impo&s;e. Then what care is taken to leave a fund &s;ufficient to the future reproduction of the revenues that are to bear all the&s;e loads? Every one, but tolerably conver&s;ant in Indian affairs, mu&s;t know that the exi&s;tence of this little kingdom depends on its control over the river Cavery. The benefits of Heaven to any community, ought never to be con|nected with political arrangements, or made to depend on the per&s;onal conduct of princes; in which the mi&s;take, or error, or neglect, or di&s;tre&s;s, or pa&s;&s;ion of a moment on either &s;ide, may bring famine on millions, and ruin an innocent nation perhaps for ages. The means of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of mankind &s;hould be as immutable as the laws of Nature, let power and dominion take what cour&s;e they may.&mdash;Ob&s;erve what has been done with regard to this important concern. The u&s;e of this river is indeed at length given to the Rajah, and a power provided for its enjoyment <HI>at his own charge</HI>; but the means of furni&s;hing that charge (and a mighty one it is) are wholly cut off. This u&s;e of the water, which ought to have no more connexion than clouds and rains, and &s;un&s;hine, with the politics of the Rajah, the Na|bob, or the Company, is expre&s;sly contrived as a means of enforcing demands and arrears of tri|bute. This horrid and unnatural in&s;trument of extortion had been a di&s;tingui&s;hing feature in the enormities of the Carnatic politics that loudly called for reformation. But the food of a whole
<PB N="78" REF="86">
people is by the reformers of India conditioned on payments from its prince, at a moment that he is overpowered with a &s;warm of their demands, with|out regard to the ability of either prince or people. In fine, by opening an avenue to the irruption of the Nabob of Arcot's creditors and &s;oucars, whom every man who did not fall in love with oppre&s;&s;ion and corruption on an experience of the ca|lamities they produced, would have rai&s;ed wall before wall, and mound before mound, to keep from a po&s;&s;ibility of entrance, a more de&s;tructive enemy than Hyder Ali is introduced into that kingdom. By this part of their arrangement, in which they e&s;tabli&s;h a debt to the Nabob of Arcot, in effect and &s;ub&s;tance, they deliver over Tanjore, bound hand and foot, to Paul Benfield, the old be|trayer, in&s;ulter, oppre&s;&s;or, and &s;courge of a coun|try, which has for years been an object of an un|remitted, but unhappily an unequal &s;truggle, be|tween the bounties of Providence to renovate, and the wickedne&s;s of mankind to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>The right honourable gentleman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas.</NOTE> talks of his fairne&s;s in determining the territorial di&s;pute between the Nabob of Arcot and the prince of that country, when he &s;uper&s;eded the determi|nation of the Directors, in whom the law had ve&s;ted the deci&s;ion of that controver&s;y. He is in this ju&s;t as feeble as he is in every other part. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay a word in refutation of any part of his argument. The mode of the proceeding &s;ufficiently &s;peaks the &s;pirit of it. It is enough to fix his character as a judge, that he <HI>never heard the Directors in defence of their adjudication, nor either of the parties in &s;upport of their re&s;pective claims.</HI> It is &s;ufficient for me, that he takes from the Ra|jah of Tanjore, by this pretended adjudication, or
<PB N="79" REF="87">
rather from his unhappy &s;ubjects, &pound;. 40,000 a year of his and their revenue, and leaves upon his and their &s;houlders all the charges that can be made on the part of the Nabob, on the part of his creditors, and on the part of the Company, without &s;o much as hearing him as to right or to ability. But what principally induces me to leave the affair of the territorial di&s;pute between the Nabob and the Rajah to another day, is this, that both the parties being &s;tripped of their all, it little &s;ignifies under which of their names the un|happy undone people are delivered over to the mercile&s;s &s;oucars, the allies of that right honourable gentleman, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In them ends the account of this long di&s;pute of the Nabob of Arcot, and the Rajah of Tanjore.</P>
<P>The right honourable gentleman is of opinion, that his judgment in this ca&s;e can be cen&s;ured by none but tho&s;e who &s;eem to act as if they were paid agents to one of the parties. What does he think of his Court of Directors? If they are paid by either of the parties, by which of them does he think they are paid? He knows that their deci&s;ion has been directly contrary to his. Shall I believe that it does not enter into his heart to con|ceive, that any per&s;on can &s;teadily and actively intere&s;t him&s;elf in the protection of the injured and oppre&s;&s;ed, without being well paid for his &s;ervice? I have taken notice of this &s;ort of di&s;cour&s;e &s;ome days ago, &s;o far as it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to relate to me. I then contented my&s;elf, as I &s;hall now do, with giving it a cold, though a very direct con|tradiction. Thus much I do from re&s;pect to truth. If I did more, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, by my anxiety to clear my&s;elf, that I had imbibed the ideas, which, for obvious rea&s;ons, the right honourable gentleman wi&s;hes to have re|ceived
<PB N="80" REF="88">
concerning all attempts to plead the cau&s;e of the natives of India, as if it were a di&s;reputable employment. If he had not forgot, in his pre&s;ent occupation, every principle which ought to have guided him, and I hope did guide him, in his late profe&s;&s;ion, he would have known, that he who takes a fee for pleading the cau&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s again&s;t power, and manfully performs the duty he has a&s;&s;umed, receives an honourable recompence for a virtuous &s;ervice. But if the right honourable gen|tleman will have no regard to fact in his in&s;inua|tions, or to rea&s;on in his opinions, I wi&s;h him at lea&s;t to con&s;ider, that if taking an earne&s;t part with regard to the oppre&s;&s;ions exerci&s;ed in India, and with regard to this mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive ca&s;e of Tanjore in particular, can ground a pre&s;umption of inte|re&s;ted motives, he is him&s;elf the mo&s;t mercenary man I know. His conduct indeed is &s;uch that he is on all occa&s;ions the &s;tanding te&s;timony again&s;t him&s;elf. He it was that fir&s;t called to that ca&s;e the attention of the Hou&s;e: The Reports of his own Committee are ample and affecting upon that &s;ubject <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Report IV. Committee of Secrecy, p. 73, and 74; and Appendix in &s;undry places.</NOTE>; and as many of us as have e&s;caped his ma&s;&s;acre, mu&s;t remember the very pathetic picture he made of the &s;ufferings of the Tanjore country, on the day when he moved the unwieldy code of his Indian re&s;olutions. Has he not &s;tated over and over again in his Reports, the ill treatment of the Rajah of Tanjore, (a branch of the royal hou&s;e of the Marattas, every injury to whom the Marattas felt as offered to them|&s;elves) as a main cau&s;e of the alienation of that people from the Briti&s;h power? And does he now think, that to betray his principles, to contradict his declarations, and to become him&s;elf an active in|&s;trument
<PB N="81" REF="89">
in tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions which he had &s;o tragi|cally lamented, is the way to clear him&s;elf of having been actuated by a pecuniary intere&s;t, at the time when he cho&s;e to appear full of tenderne&s;s to that ruined nation?</P>
<P>The right honourable gentleman is fond of pa|rading on the motives of others, and on his own. As to him&s;elf, he de&s;pi&s;es the imputations of tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;e that any thing corrupt could influence him in this his unexampled liberality of the public trea&s;ure. I do not know that I am obliged to &s;peak to the motives of mini&s;try, in the arrange|ments they have made of the pretended debts of Arcot and Tanjore. If I prove fraud and collu|&s;ion with regard to public money on tho&s;e right honourable gentlemen, I am not obliged to a&s;&s;ign their motives; becau&s;e no good motives can be pleaded in favour of their conduct. Upon that ca&s;e I &s;tand; we are at i&s;&s;ue; and I de&s;ire to go to trial. This, I am &s;ure, is not loo&s;e railing, or mean in&s;inuation, according to their low and degenerate fa&s;hion, when they make attacks on the mea&s;ures of their adver&s;aries. It is a regular and juridical cour&s;e; and, unle&s;s I choo&s;e it, nothing can compel me to go further.</P>
<P>But &s;ince the&s;e unhappy gentlemen have dared to hold a lofty tone about their motives, and affect to de&s;pi&s;e &s;u&s;picion, in&s;tead of being careful not to give cau&s;e for it, I &s;hall beg leave to lay before you &s;ome general ob&s;ervations on what I conceive was their duty in &s;o delicate a bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>If I were worthy to &s;ugge&s;t any line of pru|dence to that right honourable gentleman, I would tell him, that the way to avoid &s;u&s;picion in the &s;ettlement of pecuniary tran&s;actions, in which great frauds have been very &s;trongly pre&s;umed, is, to attend to the&s;e few plain principles:&mdash;Fir&s;t, To
<PB N="82" REF="90">
hear all parties equally, and not the managers for the &s;u&s;pected claimants only.&mdash;Not to proceed in the dark; but to act with as much publicity as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;Not to precipitate deci&s;ion.&mdash;To be religious in following the rules pre&s;cribed in the commi&s;&s;ion under which we act. And, la&s;tly, and above all, not to be fond of &s;training con|&s;tructions, to force a juri&s;diction, and to draw to our&s;elves the management of a tru&s;t in its nature invidious and obnoxious to &s;u&s;picion, where the plaine&s;t letter of the law does not compel it. If the&s;e few plain rules are ob&s;erved, no corruption ought to be &s;u&s;pected; if any of them are violated, &s;u&s;picion will attach in proportion. If all of them are violated, a corrupt motive of &s;ome kind or other will not only be &s;u&s;pected, but mu&s;t be vio|lently pre&s;umed.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons in who&s;e favour all the&s;e rules have been violated, and the conduct of mini&s;ters towards them, will naturally call for your con&s;ideration, and will &s;erve to lead you through a &s;eries and combi|nation of facts and characters, if I do not mi&s;take, into the very inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of this my&s;terious bu|&s;ine&s;s. You will then, be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the materials on which the principles of &s;ound juri&s;|prudence will found, or will reject the pre&s;ump|tion of corrupt motives; or if &s;uch motives are indicated, will point out to you of what particular nature the corruption is.</P>
<P>Our wonderful mini&s;ter, as you all know, form|ed a new plan, a plan <HI>in&s;igne recens alio indictum ore,</HI> a plan for &s;upporting the freedom of our con&s;ti|tution by court intrigues, and for removing its corruptions by Indian delinquency. To carry that bold paradoxical de&s;ign into execution, &s;ufficient funds and apt in&s;truments became nece&s;&s;ary. You are perfectly &s;en&s;ible that a Parliamentary Reform occupies his thoughts day and night, as an e&s;|&s;ential
<PB N="83" REF="91">
member in this extraordinary project. In his anxious re&s;earches upon this &s;ubje&s;t, natural in&s;tinct, as well as &s;ound policy, would direct his eyes, and &s;ettle his choice on Paul Benfield. Paul Benfield is the grand parliamentary reformer, the reformer to whom the whole choir of reformers bow, and to whom even the right honourable gentleman him&s;elf mu&s;t yield the palm: For what region in the empire, what city, what borough, what county, what tribunal, in this kingdom, is not full of his labours? Others have been only &s;peculators; he is the grand practical reformer; and whil&s;t the Chancellor of the Exchequer pledges in vain the man and the mini&s;ter, to increa&s;e the provincial members, Mr. Benfield has au&s;piciou&s;ly and prac|tically begun it. Leaving far behind him even Lord Camelford's generous de&s;ign of be&s;towing Old Sarum on the Bank of England, Mr. Ben|field has thrown in the borough of Cricklade to reinforce the county repre&s;entation. Not con|tent with this, in order to&s;tation a &s;teady phalanx for all future reforms, this public-&s;pirited u&s;urer, amid&s;t his charitable toils for the relief of India, did not forget the poor rotten con&s;titution of his native country. For her, he did not di&s;dain to &s;toop to the trade of a whole&s;ale uphol&s;terer for this hou&s;e, to furni&s;h it, not with the faded ta|pe&s;try figures of antiquated merit, &s;uch as decorate, and may reproach &s;ome other hou&s;es, but with real, &s;olid, living patterns of true modern virtue. Paul Benfield made (reckoning him&s;elf) no fewer than eight members in the la&s;t parliament. What copious &s;treams of pure blood mu&s;t he not have transfu&s;ed into the veins of the pre&s;ent!</P>
<P>But what is even more &s;triking than the real &s;er|vices of this new-imported patriot, is his mode&s;ty. As &s;oon as he had conferred this benefit on the con&s;titution, he withdrew him&s;elf from our ap|plau&s;e.
<PB N="84" REF="92">
He conceived that the duties of a member of parliament (which with the elect faithful, the true believers, the <HI>I&s;lam</HI> of parliamentary reform, are of little or no merit, perhaps not much better than &s;pecious &s;ins) might be as well attended to in India as in England, and the means of refor|mation to Parliament it&s;elf, be far better provided. Mr. Benfield was therefore no &s;ooner elected than he &s;et off for Madras, and defrauded the long|ing eyes of parliament. We have never enjoyed in this Hou&s;e the luxury of beholding that minion of the human race, and contemplating that vi&s;age, which has &s;o long reflected the happine&s;s of na|tions.</P>
<P>It was therefore not po&s;&s;ible for the mini&s;ter to con&s;ult per&s;onally with this great man. What then was he to do? Through a &s;agacity that never failed him in the&s;e pur&s;uits, he found out in Mr. Benfield's repre&s;entative, his exact re&s;emblance. A &s;pecific attraction by which he gravitates towards all &s;uch characters, &s;oon brought our mini&s;ter into a clo&s;e connection with Mr. Benfield's agent and attorney; that is, with the grand contractor (whom I name to honour) Mr. Richard Atkin&s;on; a name that will be well remembered as long as the Records of this Hou&s;e, as long as the Records of the Briti&s;h Trea&s;ury, as long as the monumental debt of England, &s;hall endure.</P>
<P>This gentleman, Sir, acts as attorney for Mr. Paul Benfield. Every one who hears me, is well acquainted with the &s;acred friend&s;hip, and the &s;teady mutual attachment that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between him and the pre&s;ent mini&s;ter. As many members as cho&s;e to attend in the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of this par|liament, can be&s;t tell their own feelings at the &s;cenes which were then acted. How much that honourable gentleman was con&s;ulted in the origi|nal frame and fabric of the bill, commonly called
<PB N="85" REF="93">
Mr. Pitt's India Bill, is matter only of conjecture; though by no means difficult to divine. But the public was an indignant witne&s;s of the o&s;tentation with which that mea&s;ure was made his own, and the authority with which he brought up clau&s;e after clau&s;e, to &s;tuff and fatten the rankne&s;s of that cor|rupt act. As fa&s;t as the clau&s;es were brought up to the table, they were accepted. No he&s;itation; no di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. They were received by the new mini&s;ter, not with approbation, but with implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The reformation may be e&s;timated, by &s;eeing who was the reformer. Paul Benfield's a&s;&s;ociate and agent was held up to the world as legi&s;lator of Indo&s;tan. But it was nece&s;&s;ary to authenticate the coalition between the men of in|trigue in India and the mini&s;ter of intrigue in Eng|land, by a &s;tudied di&s;play of the power of this their connecting link. Every tru&s;t, every honour, every di&s;tinction, was to be heaped upon him. He was at once made a director of the India Com|pany; made an alderman of London; and to be made, if mini&s;try could prevail (and I am &s;orry to &s;ay how near, how very near they were pre|vailing) repre&s;entative of the capital of this king|dom. But to &s;ecure his &s;ervices again&s;t all ri&s;que, he was brought in for a mini&s;terial borough. On his part, he was not wanting in zeal for the common cau&s;e. His adverti&s;ements &s;hew his motives, and the merits upon which he &s;tood. For your mini&s;|ter, this worn-out veteran &s;ubmitted to enter into the du&s;ty field of the London conte&s;t; and you all re|member, that in the &s;ame virtuous cau&s;e, he &s;ub|mitted to keep a &s;ort of public office or counting-hou&s;e, where the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the la&s;t general election was managed. It was openly managed by the direct agent and attorney of Benfield. It was managed upon Indian principles, and for an Indian intere&s;t. This was the golden cup of abominations;
<PB N="86" REF="94">
this the chalice of the fornications of rapine, u&s;ury, and oppre&s;&s;ion, which was held out by the gorgeous ea&s;tern harlot; which &s;o many of the people, &s;o many of the nobles of this land, had drained to the very dregs. Do you think that no reckoning was to follow this lewd debauch? that no pay|ment was to be demanded for this riot of public drunkenne&s;s and national pro&s;titution? Here! you have it here before you. The principal of the grand election manager mu&s;t be indemnified; ac|cordingly the claims of Benfield and his crew mu&s;t be put above all enquiry.</P>
<P>For &s;everal years, Benfield appeared as the chief proprietor, as well as the chief agent, director, and controller, of this &s;y&s;tem of debt. The wor|thy chairman of the Company has &s;tated the claims of this &s;ingle gentleman on the Nabob of Arcot, as amounting to five hundred thou&s;and pound <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Smith's Prote&s;t.</NOTE>. Po&s;|&s;ibly at the time of the chairman's &s;tate, they might have been as high. Eight hundred thou&s;and had been mentioned &s;ometime before<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Madras corre&s;pondence on this &s;ubject.</NOTE>; and according to the practice of &s;hifting the names of creditors in the&s;e tran&s;actions, and reducing or rai&s;ing the debt it&s;elf at plea&s;ure, I think it not impo&s;&s;ible, that at one period, the name of Benfield might have &s;tood before tho&s;e frightful figures. But my be&s;t information goes to fix his &s;hare no higher than four hundred thou&s;and pounds. By the &s;cheme of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try for adding to the principal twelve <HI>per cent.</HI> from the year 1777 to the year 1781, four hundred thou&s;and pounds, that &s;malle&s;t of the &s;ums ever mentioned for Mr. Benfield, will form a capital of &pound;. 592,000, at &s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI> Thus, be&s;ides the arrears of three years, amounting to &pound;. 106,500 (which, as fa&s;t as received, may be legally lent out at 12 <HI>per cent.</HI>) Benfield has received by
<PB N="87" REF="95">
the mini&s;terial grant before you, an annuity of &pound;. 35,520 a year, charged on the public revenues.</P>
<P>Our mirror of Mini&s;ters of finance, did not think this enough for the &s;ervices of &s;uch a friend as Benfield. He found that Lord Macartney, in order to frighten the Court of Directors from the project, of obliging the Nabob to give &s;ou|car &s;ecurity for his debt, a&s;&s;ured them, that if they &s;hould take that &s;tep, Benfield <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, N^o 5 A.</NOTE> would in|fallibly be the &s;oucar; and would thereby become the entire ma&s;ter of the Carnatic. What Lord Macartney thought &s;ufficient to deter the very agents and partakers with Benfield in his iniquities, was the inducement to the two right honourable gentlemen to order this very &s;oucar &s;ecurity to be given, and to recal Benfield to the city of Madras, from the &s;ort of decent exile, into which he had been relegated by Lord Macartney. You mu&s;t therefore con&s;ider Benfield as &s;oucar &s;ecurity for &pound;. 480,000 a year, which at twenty-four <HI>per cent.</HI> (&s;uppo&s;ing him contented with that profit) will, with the intere&s;t of his old debt, produce an an|nual income of &pound;. 149,520 a year.</P>
<P>Here is a &s;pecimen of the new and pure ari&s;to|cracy created by the right honourable gentleman<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Right honourable William Pitt.</NOTE>, as the &s;upport of the crown and con&s;titution, again&s;t the old, corrupt, refractory, natural intere&s;ts of this kingdom; and this is the grand counterpoi&s;e again&s;t all odious coalitions of the&s;e intere&s;ts. A &s;ingle Benfield outweighs them all; a criminal, who long &s;ince ought to have fattened the region kites with his offal, is, by his maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters, en|throned in the government of a great kingdom, and enfeoffed with an e&s;tate, which in the compa|ri&s;on effaces the &s;plendor of all the nobility of Europe. To bring a little more di&s;tinctly into
<PB N="88" REF="96">
view the true &s;ecret of this dark tran&s;action, I beg you particularly to advert to the circum&s;tances which I am going to place before you.</P>
<P>The general corps of creditors, as well as Mr. Benfield him&s;elf, not looking well into futurity, nor pre&s;aging the mini&s;ter of this day, thought it not expedient for their common intere&s;t, that &s;uch a name as his &s;hould &s;tand at the head of their li&s;t. It was therefore agreed among&s;t them, that Mr. Benfield &s;hould di&s;appear by making over his debt to Me&s;&s;rs. Taylor, Majendie, and Call, and &s;hould in return be &s;ecured by their bond.</P>
<P>The debt thus exonerated of &s;o great a weight of its odium, and otherwi&s;e reduced from its alarming bulk, the agents thought they might ven|ture to print a li&s;t of the creditors. This was done for the fir&s;t time in the year 1783, during the duke of Portland's admini&s;tration. In this li&s;t the name of Benfield was not to be &s;een. To this &s;trong negative te&s;timony was added the further te&s;timony of the Nabob of Arcot. That Prince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix N^o 8.</NOTE> (or rather Mr. Benfield for him) writes to the Court of Directors a letter <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dated 13th October. For further illu&s;tration of the &s;tyle in which the&s;e letters are written, and the principles on which they proceed, &s;ee letters from the Nabob to the Court of Di|rectors, dated Augu&s;t 16th, and September 7th, 1783, deli|vered by Mr. James Macpher&s;on, Mini&s;ter to the Nabob, Ja|nuary 14th, 1784.</NOTE> full of complaints and accu|&s;ations again&s;t Lord Macartney, conveyed in &s;uch terms as were natural for one of Mr. Benfield's ha|bits and education to employ. Among&s;t the re&s;t, he is made to complain of his Lord&s;hip's endea|vouring to prevent an intercour&s;e of politene&s;s and &s;entiment between him and Mr. Benfield; and to aggravate the affront, he expre&s;sly declares Mr. Benfield's vi&s;its to be only on account of re&s;pect
<PB N="89" REF="97">
and of gratitude, as no pecuniary tran&s;actions &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between them.</P>
<P>Such, for a con&s;iderable &s;pace of time, was the outward form of the loan of 1777, in which Mr. Benfield had no &s;ort of concern. At length intelli|gence arrived at Madras, that this debt, which had always been renounced by the Court of Directors, was rather like to become the &s;ubject of &s;omething more like a criminal enquiry, than of any patronage or &s;anction from Parliament. Every &s;hip brought accounts, one &s;tronger than the other, of the preva|lence of the determined enemies of the Indian &s;y&s;|tem. The public revenues became an object de&s;pe|rate to the hopes of Mr. Benfield; he therefore re|&s;olved to fall upon his a&s;&s;ociates, and, in viola|tion of that faith which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among tho&s;e who have abandoned all other, commences a &s;uit in the Mayor's Court again&s;t Taylor, Majendie, and Call, for the bond given to him, when he agreed to di&s;|appear for his own benefit as well as that of the common concern. The a&s;&s;ignees of his debt, who little expected the &s;pringing of this mine, even from &s;uch an engineer as Mr. Benfield, after recover|ing their fir&s;t alarm, thought it be&s;t to take ground on the real &s;tate of the tran&s;action. They divulged the whole my&s;tery, and were prepared to plead, that they had never received from Mr. Benfield any other con&s;ideration for the bond, than a transfer, in tru&s;t for him&s;elf, of his demand on the Na|bob of Arcot. An univer&s;al indignation aro&s;e again&s;t the per&s;idy of Mr. Benfield's proceeding: The event of the &s;uit was looked upon as &s;o cer|tain, that Benfield was compelled to retreat as precipitately as he had advanced boldly; he gave up his bond, and was rein&s;tated in his original de|mand, to wait the fortune of other claimants. At that time, and at Madras, this hope was dull in|deed; but at home another &s;cene was preparing.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="98">It was long before any public account of this di&s;covery at Madras had arrived in England, that the pre&s;ent mini&s;ter, and his Board of Control, thought fit to determine on the debt of 1777. The recorded proceedings at this time knew no|thing of any debt to Benfield. There was his own te&s;timony; there was the te&s;timony of the li&s;t; there was the te&s;timony of the Nabob of Arcot again&s;t it. Yet &s;uch was the mini&s;ter's feel|ing of the true &s;ecret of this tran&s;action, that they thought proper, in the teeth of all the&s;e te&s;timo|nies, to give him licence to return to Madras. Here the mini&s;ters were under &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ment. Confounded between their re&s;olution of reward|ing the good &s;ervices of Benfield's friends and a&s;&s;ociates in England, and the &s;hame of &s;ending that notorious incendiary to the court of the Nabob of Arcot, to renew his intrigues again&s;t the Briti&s;h government, at the time they authorize his return they forbid him, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, from any conver&s;ation with the Nabob or his Mini&s;ters; that is, they forbid his communication with the very per&s;on on account of his dealings with whom they permit his return to that city. To overtop this contradiction, there is not a word re&s;training him from the free&s;t intercour&s;e with the Nabob's &s;econd &s;on,the real author of all that is done in the Nabob's name; who, in conjunction with this very Ben|field, has acquired an ab&s;olute dominion over that unhappy man, is able to per&s;uade him to put his &s;ignature to whatever paper they plea&s;e, and often without any communication of the con|tents. This management was detailed to them at full length by Lord Macartney, and they cannot pretend ignorance of it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, F.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I believe, after this expo&s;ure of facts, no man
<PB N="91" REF="99">
can entertain a doubt of the collu&s;ion of mini&s;ters with the corrupt intere&s;t of the delinquents in In|dia. Whenever tho&s;e in authority provide for the intere&s;t of any per&s;on, on the real but con|cealed &s;tate of his affairs, without regard to his avowed, public, and often&s;ible pretences, it mu&s;t be pre&s;umed that they are in confederacy with him, becau&s;e they act for him on the &s;ame fraudulent principles on which he acts for him&s;elf. It is plain, that the Mini&s;ters were fully appri&s;ed of Benfield's real &s;ituation, which he had u&s;ed means to conceal whil&s;t concealment an&s;wered his pur|po&s;es. They were, or the per&s;on on whom they relied was, of the cabinet council of Benfield, in the very depth of all his my&s;teries. An hone&s;t magi&s;trate compels men to abide by one &s;tory. An equitable judge would not hear of the claim of a man who had him&s;elf thought proper to re|nounce it. With &s;uch a judge his &s;huffling and pre|varication would have damned his claims; &s;uch a judge never would have known, but in order to an|imadvert upon proceedings of that character.</P>
<P>I have thus laid before you, Mr. Speaker, I think with &s;ufficient clearne&s;s, the connection of the mini&s;ters with Mr. Atkin&s;on at the general election; I have laid open to you the connection of Atkin&s;on with Benfield; I have &s;hewn Benfield's employment of his wealth, in creating a parlia|mentary intere&s;t, to procure a mini&s;terial protection; I have &s;et before your eyes his large concern in the debt, his practices to hide that concern from the public eye, and the liberal protection which he has received from the mini&s;ter. If this chain of circum&s;tances do not lead you nece&s;&s;arily to con|clude that the mini&s;ter has paid to the avarice of Benfield the &s;ervices done by Benfield's connections to his ambition, I do not know any thing &s;hort of the confe&s;&s;ion of the party that can per&s;uade

you of his guilt. Clande&s;tine and collu&s;ive practice can only be traced by combination and compari&s;on of circum&s;tances. To reject &s;uch combination and compari&s;on is to reject the only means of detecting fraud; it is indeed to give it a patent and free licence to cheat with impunity.</P>
<P>I confine my&s;elf to the connection of mini&s;ters, mediately or immediately, with only two per&s;ons concerned in this debt. How many others, who &s;upport their power and greatne&s;s within and with|out doors, are concerned originally, or by transfers of the&s;e debts, mu&s;t be left to general opinion. I refer to the Reports of the Select Committee for the proceedings of &s;ome of the agents in the&s;e affairs, and their attempts, at lea&s;t, to furni&s;h mi|ni&s;ters with the means of buying general courts, and even whole parliaments, in the gro&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Second Report of Select (General Smith's) Committee.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I know that the mini&s;ters will think it little le&s;s than acquittal, that they are not charged with hav|ing taken to them&s;elves &s;ome part of the money of which they have made &s;o liberal a donation to their partizans, though the charge may be indi&s;putably fixed upon the corruption of their politics. For my part, I follow their crimes to that point to which legal pre&s;umptions and natural indications lead me, without con&s;idering what &s;pecies of evil motive tends mo&s;t to aggravate or to extenuate the guilt of their conduct. But if I am to &s;peak my private &s;entiments, I think that in a thou&s;and ca&s;es for one it would be far le&s;s mi&s;chievous to the public, and full as little di&s;honourable to them&s;elves, to be polluted with direct bribery, than thus to become a &s;tanding auxiliary to the oppre&s;&s;ion, u&s;ury, and peculation of multitudes, in order to obtain a cor|rupt &s;upport to their power. It is by bribing, not &s;o often by being bribed, that wicked politicians
<PB N="93" REF="103">
bring ruin on mankind. Avarice is a rival to the pur&s;uits of many. It finds a multitude of checks, and many oppo&s;ers, in every walk of life. But the objects of ambition are for the few; and every per&s;on who aims at indirect profit, and therefore wants other protection than innocence and law, in&s;tead of its rival, becomes its in&s;trument. There is a natural allegiance and fealty due to this domineering paramount evil, from all the va&s;&s;al vices, which acknowledge its &s;uperiority, and rea|dily militate under its banners; and it is under that di&s;cipline alone that avarice is able to &s;pread to any con&s;iderable extent, or to render it&s;elf a general public mi&s;chief. It is therefore no apology for mini&s;ters, that they have not been bought by the Ea&s;t India delinquents, but that they have only formed an alliance with them for &s;creening each other from ju&s;tice, according to the exigence of their &s;everal nece&s;&s;ities. That they have done &s;o is evident; and the junction of the power of office in England, with the abu&s;e of authority in the Ea&s;t, has not only prevented even the appearance of re|dre&s;s to the grievances of India, but I wi&s;h it may not be found to have dulled, if not extingui&s;hed, the honour, the candour, the genero&s;ity, the good-nature, which u&s;ed formerly to characteri&s;e the people of England. I confe&s;s, I wi&s;h that &s;ome more feeling than I have yet ob&s;erved for the &s;uf|ferings of our fellow-creatures and fellow-&s;ubjects in that oppre&s;&s;ed part of the world, had manife&s;ted it&s;elf in any one quarter of the kingdom, or in any one large de&s;cription of men.</P>
<P>That the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions exi&s;t, is a fact no more de|nied, than it is re&s;ented as it ought to be. Much evil has been done in India under the Briti&s;h authority.

But it will a&s;toni&s;h po&s;terity, when they read our opinions in our actions, that after years of enquiry we have found out that the &s;ole grievance of India con&s;i&s;ted in this, That the &s;er|vants of the Company there had not profited enough of their opportunities, nor drained it &s;uffi|ciently of its trea&s;ures; when they &s;hall hear that the very fir&s;t and only important act of a com|mi&s;&s;ion &s;pecially named by act of parliament, is to charge upon an undone country, in favour of a handful of men in the humble&s;t ranks of the pub|lic &s;ervice, the enormous &s;um of perhaps four mil|lions of &s;terling money.</P>
<P>It is difficult for the mo&s;t wi&s;e and upright go|vernment to correct the abu&s;es of remote delegated power, productive of unmea&s;ured wealth, and pro|tected by the boldne&s;s and &s;trength of the &s;ame ill-got riches. The&s;e abu&s;es, full of their own wild native vigour, will grow and flouri&s;h under mere neglect. But where the &s;upreme authority, not content with winking at the rapacity of its inferior in&s;truments, is &s;o &s;hamele&s;s and corrupt as openly to give bounties and premiums for di&s;obedience to its laws; when it will not tru&s;t to the activity of avarice in the pur&s;uit of its own gains; when it &s;e|cures public robbery by all the careful jealou&s;y and attention with which it ought to protect property from &s;uch violence; the commonwealth then is be|come totally perverted from its purpo&s;es; neither God nor man will long endure it; nor will it long endure it&s;elf. In that ca&s;e, there is an unnatural infection, a pe&s;tilential taint fermenting in the con|&s;titution of &s;ociety, which fever and convul&s;ions of &s;ome kind or other mu&s;t throw off; or in which the vital powers, wor&s;ted in an unequal &s;truggle, are pu&s;hed back upon them&s;elves, and by a rever&s;al of their whole functions, fe&s;ter to gangrene, to death; and in&s;tead of what was but ju&s;t now the delight

and boa&s;t of the creation, there will be ca&s;t out in the face of the &s;un, a bloated, putrid, noi&s;ome carca&s;s, full of &s;tench and poi&s;on, an offence, a horror, a le&s;&s;on to the world.</P>
<P>In my opinion, we ought not to wait for the fruitle&s;s in&s;truction of calamity to enquire into the abu&s;es which bring upon us ruin in the wor&s;t of its forms, in the lo&s;s of our fame and virtue. But the right honourable gentleman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas.</NOTE> &s;ays, in an&s;wer to all the powerful arguments of my honourable friend&mdash;
<Q>that this enquiry is of a delicate nature, and that the &s;tate will &s;uffer detriment by the expo&s;ure of this tran&s;action.</Q>
But it is expo&s;ed; it is per|fectly known in every member, in every particle, and in every way, except that which may lead to a remedy. He knows that the papers of corre&s;pon|dence are printed, and that they are in every hand.</P>
<P>He and delicacy are a rare and a &s;ingular coa|lition. He thinks that to divulge our Indian po|litics, may be highly dangerous.

He that brought forth in the utmo&s;t de|tail, in &s;everal va&s;t printed folios, the mo&s;t recon|dite parts of the politics, the military, the revenues of the Briti&s;h empire in India.

<P>Whil&s;t di&s;covery of the mi&s;government of others led to his own power, it was wi&s;e to enquire: it was &s;afe to publi&s;h; there was then no delicacy; there was then no danger. But when his object is obtained, and in his imitation he has outdone the crimes that he had reprobated in volumes of Re|ports, and in &s;heets of bills of pains and penalties; then concealment becomes prudence; and it con|cerns the &s;afety of the &s;tate, that we &s;hould not know, in a mode of parliamentary cognizance, what all the world knows but too well, that is, in what manner he choo&s;es to di&s;po&s;e of the public revenues to the creatures of his politics.</P>
<P>The debate has been long, and as much &s;o on my part, at lea&s;t, as on the part of tho&s;e who have &s;poken before me. But long as it is, the more mate|rial half of the &s;ubject has hardly been touched on; that is, the corrupt and de&s;tructive &s;y&s;tem to which this debt has been rendered &s;ub&s;ervient, and which &s;eems to be pur&s;ued with at lea&s;t as much vigour and regularity as ever. If I con&s;idered your ea&s;e or my own, rather than the weight and importance of this que&s;tion, I ought to make &s;ome apology to you, perhaps &s;ome apology to my&s;elf, for hav|ing detained your attention &s;o long. I know on what ground I tread. This &s;ubject, at one time taken up with &s;o much fervour and zeal, is no longer a favourite in this Hou&s;e. The Hou&s;e it|&s;elf has undergone a great and &s;ignal revolution. To &s;ome the &s;ubject is &s;trange and uncouth; to &s;everal har&s;h and di&s;ta&s;teful; to the reliques of the la&s;t parliament it is a matter of fear and apprehen|&s;ion. It is natural for tho&s;e who have &s;een their friends &s;ink in the tornado which raged during the late &s;hift of the mon&s;oon, and have hardly e&s;caped on the planks of the general wreck, it
<PB N="97" REF="107">
is but too natural for them, as &s;oon as they make the rocks and quick&s;ands of their former di&s;a&s;|ters, to put about their new-built barks, and, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to keep aloof from this perilous lee &s;hore.</P>
<P>But let us do what we plea&s;e to put India from our thoughts, we can do nothing to &s;eparate it from our public intere&s;t and our national reputa|tion. Our attempts to bani&s;h this importunate duty, will only make it return upon us again and again, and every time in a &s;hape more unplea&s;ant than the former. A government has been fabri|cated for that great province; the right honour|able Gentleman &s;ays, that therefore you ought not to examine into its conduct. Heavens! what an argu|ment is this! We are not to examine into the con|duct of the Direction, becau&s;e it is an old govern|ment: we are not to examine into this Board of Control, becau&s;e it is a new one. Then we are only to examine into the conduct of tho&s;e who have no conduct to account for. Unfortunately the ba&s;is of this new government has been laid on old condemned delinquents, and its &s;uper&s;tructure is rai&s;ed out of pro&s;ecutors turned into protectors. The event has been &s;uch as might be expected. But if it had been otherwi&s;e con&s;tituted; had it been con&s;ti|tuted even as I wi&s;hed, and as the mover of this que&s;|tion had planned, the better part of the propo&s;ed e&s;tabli&s;hment was in the publicity of its proceed|ings; in its perpetual re&s;pon&s;ibility to parliament. Without this check, what is our government at home, even awed, as every European government is, by an audience formed of the other States of Europe, by the applau&s;e or condemnation of the di&s;cerning and critical company before which it acts? But if the &s;cene on the other &s;ide of the globe, which tempts, invites, almo&s;t compels to tyrannny and rapine, be not in&s;pected with
<PB N="98" REF="108">
the eye of a &s;evere and unremitting vigilance, &s;hame and de&s;truction mu&s;t en&s;ue. For one, the wor&s;t event of this day, though it may deject, &s;hall not break or &s;ubdue me. The call upon us is authoritative. Let who will &s;hrink back, I &s;hall be found at my po&s;t. Baffled, di&s;countenanced, &s;ubdued, di&s;credited, as the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice and humanity is, it will be only the dearer to me. Whoever therefore &s;hall at any time bring before you any thing towards the relief of our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fellow-citizens in India, and towards a &s;ubver&s;ion of the pre&s;ent mo&s;t corrupt and oppre&s;&s;ive &s;y&s;tem for its government, in me &s;hall find, a weak I am afraid, but a &s;teady, earne&s;t, and faithful a&s;&s;i&s;tant.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">NABOB OF ARCOT'S DEBTS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. GEORGE SMITH being a&s;ked, Whether the debts of the Nabob of Arcot have increa&s;ed &s;ince he knew Madras? he &s;aid, Yes, they have. He di&s;tingui&s;hes his debts into two &s;orts; tho&s;e contracted before the year 1766, and tho&s;e contracted from that year to the year in which he left Madras.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, What he thinks is the original amount of the old debts? he &s;aid, Between twenty-three and twenty-four lacks of pagodas, as well as he can recollect.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, What was the amount of that debt when he left Madras? he &s;aid, Between 4 and 5 lacks of pagodas, as he under&s;tood.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, What was the amount of the new debt when he left Madras? he &s;aid, In November 1777 that debt amounted, according to the Nabob's own ac|count, and publi&s;hed at Chipauk, his place of re&s;idence, to &s;ixty lacks of pagodas, independent of the old debt, on which debt of 60 lacks of pagodas, the Nabob did agree to pay an intere&s;t of twelve per cent per annum.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whe|ther this debt was approved of by the Court of Directors? he &s;aid, He does not know it was.&mdash; Being a&s;ked, Whether the old debt was recognized by the Court of Directors? he &s;aid, Yes, it has been; and the Court of Directors have &s;ent out repeated orders to the Pre&s;ident and Council of Madras, to enforce its recovery and payment.&mdash; Being a&s;ked, If the intere&s;t upon the new debt is punctually paid? he &s;aid, It was not during his re&s;idence at Madras, from 1777 to 1779, in which period he thinks no more than five per cent. intere&s;t was paid, in different dividends of two and one per cent.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, What is the u&s;ual cour&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="112">
taken by the Nabob, concerning the arrears of in|tere&s;t? he &s;aid, Not having ever lent him monies him&s;elf, he cannot fully an&s;wer as to the mode of &s;ettling the intere&s;t with him.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked, Whether he has rea&s;on to believe the 60 lacks of pagodas was all principal money really and truly advanced to the Nabob of Arcot, or a fictitious capital, made up of obligations given by him, where no money or goods were received, or which was increa&s;ed by the uniting into it a greater intere&s;t than the 12 per cent. expre&s;&s;ed to be due on the capital? he &s;aid, He has no rea&s;on to be|lieve that the &s;um of 60 lacks of pagodas was lent in money or goods to the Nabob, becau&s;e that &s;um he thinks is of more value than all the money, goods, and chattels in the &s;ettlement; but he does not know in what mode or manner this debt of the Nabob's was incurred or accumulated.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether it was not a general and well-grounded opinion at Madras, that a great part of this &s;um was accumulated by obligations, and were for &s;ervices performed or to be performed for the Nabob? he &s;aid, He has heard that a part of this debt was given for the purpo&s;es mentioned in the above que&s;tion, but he does not know that it was &s;o.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether it was the general opinion of the &s;ettlement? he &s;aid, He cannot &s;ay that it was the general opinion, but it was the opinion of a con&s;iderable part of the &s;ettlement.&mdash; Being a&s;ked, Whether it was the declared opinion of tho&s;e that were concerned in the debt, or tho&s;e that were not? he &s;aid, It was the opinion of both parties, at lea&s;t &s;uch of them as he conver&s;ed with.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he has rea&s;on to be|lieve that the intere&s;t really paid by the Nabob, upon obligations given, or money lent, did not fre|quently exceed 12 per cent.? He &s;aid, Prior to the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t 1774, he had had rea&s;on to believe,
<PB N="5" REF="113">
that a higher intere&s;t than 12 per cent. was paid by the Nabob on monies lent to him; but from and after that period, when the la&s;t act of parliament took place in India, he does not know that more than 12 per cent. had been paid by the Nabob, or received from him.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether it is not his opinion, that the Nabob has paid more than 12 per cent. for money due &s;ince the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t 1774? he &s;aid, He has heard that he has, but he does not know it.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he has been told &s;o by any con&s;iderable and weighty authority, that was like to know? he &s;aid, He has been &s;o informed by per&s;ons who he believes had a very good opportunity of knowing it.&mdash; Being a&s;ked, Whether he was ever told &s;o by the Nabob of Arcot him&s;elf? he &s;aid, He does not recollect that the Nabob of Arcot directly told him &s;o, but from what he &s;aid, he did infer that he paid a higher intere&s;t than 12 per cent.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith being a&s;ked, Whether, in the cour&s;e of trade, he ever &s;old any thing to the Nabob of Arcot? he &s;aid, In the year 1775 he did &s;ell to the Nabob of Arcot pearls to the amount of 32,500 pagodas, for which the Nabob gave him an order or tankah on the country of Tanjore, payable in &s;ix months, without intere&s;t.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whe|ther, at the time he a&s;ked the Nabob his price for the pearls, the Nabob beat down that price, as dealers commonly do? he &s;aid, No; &s;o far from it, he offered him more than he a&s;ked by 1,000 pago|das, and which he rejected.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether, in &s;ettling a tran&s;action of di&s;count with the Nabob's agent, he was not offered a greater di&s;count than &pound;. 12 per cent.; he &s;aid, In di&s;counting a &s;oucar's bill for 1,80,000 pagodas, the Nabob's agent did offer him a di&s;count of &pound;. 24 per cent. per annum, &s;aying, that it was the u&s;ual rate of di&s;count paid by the Nabob; but which he would not accept of,
<PB N="6" REF="114">
thinking him&s;elf confined by the act of parliament limiting the intere&s;t of monies to &pound;. 12 per cent. and accordingly he di&s;counted the bill at &pound;. 12 per cent. per annum only.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he does not think tho&s;e offers were made him, becau&s;e the Nabob thought he was a per&s;on of &s;ome con|&s;equence in the &s;ettlement? he &s;aid, Being only a private merchant, he apprehends that the offer was made to him more from its being a general prac|tice, than from any opinion of his importance.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Right honourable Lord Macartney, K. B. Pre&s;ident, and Governor, &amp;c. Select Committee of Fort St. George.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord, and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHOUGH we have, in obedience to your commands of the 5th January, regularly laid before you our proceedings at large, and have occa|&s;ionally addre&s;&s;ed you upon &s;uch points as required your re&s;olutions or orders for our guidance, we &s;till think it nece&s;&s;ary to collect and dige&s;t, in a &s;ummary report, tho&s;e tran&s;actions in the manage|ment of the a&s;&s;igned revenue, which have princi|pally engaged our attention, and which, upon the proceeding, are too much intermixed with ordi|nary occurrences to be readily traced and under|&s;tood.</P>
<P>Such a report may be formed with the greater propriety at this time, when your Lord&s;hip, &amp;c. have been plea&s;ed to conclude your arrangements for the rent of &s;everal of the Nabob's di&s;tricts. Our aim in it is briefly to explain the &s;tate of the Carnatic at the period of the Nabob's a&s;&s;ignment; the particular cau&s;es which exi&s;ted, to the prejudice of that a&s;&s;ignment, after it was made; and the
<PB N="8" REF="116">
mea&s;ures which your Lord&s;hip, &amp;c. have, upon our recommendation, adopted for removing tho&s;e cau&s;es, and introducing a more regular and benefi|cial &s;y&s;tem of management in the country.</P>
<P>Hyder Ally having entered the Carnatic with his whole force, about the middle of July 1780, and employed fire and &s;word in its de&s;truction for near eighteen months before the Nabob's a&s;&s;ign|ment took place, it will not be difficult to conceive the &s;tate of the country at that period. In tho&s;e provinces which were fully expo&s;ed to the ravages of hor&s;e, &s;carce a ve&s;tige remained either of popu|lation or agriculture: &s;uch of the mi&s;erable inha|bitants as e&s;caped the fury of the &s;word were either carried into the My&s;ore country, or left to &s;truggle under the horrors of famine. The Arcot and Trichinopoly di&s;tricts began early to feel the ef|fects of this de&s;olating war. Tinnevelly, Madura, and Ramnadaporum, though little infe&s;ted with Hyder's troops, became a prey to the incur&s;ions of the Polygars, who &s;tript them of the greate&s;t part of their revenues; Ongole, Nellore, and Pal|naud, the only remaining di&s;tricts, had &s;uffered but in a &s;mall degree.</P>
<P>The misfortunes of war, however, were not the only evils which the Carnatic experienced. The Nabob's Aumildars, and other &s;ervants, appear to have taken advantage of the general confu&s;ion to enrich them&s;elves. A very &s;mall part of the re|venue was accounted for; and &s;o high were the ordinary expences of every di&s;trict, that double the apparent produce of the whole country would not have &s;atisfied them.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate, which we believe is no way exagge|rated, the Company took charge of the a&s;&s;igned countries. Their pro&s;pect of relief from the heavy burthens of the war, was indeed but little advanced by the Nabob's conce&s;&s;ion; and the revenues of
<PB N="9" REF="117">
the Carnatic &s;eemed in danger of being irrecovera|bly lo&s;t, unle&s;s a &s;peedy and entire change of &s;y&s;tem could be adopted.</P>
<P>On our minutes of the 21&s;t January, we treated the &s;ubject of the a&s;&s;ignment at &s;ome length, and pointed out the mi&s;chiefs which, in addition to the effects of the war, had ari&s;en from what we con|ceived to be wrong and oppre&s;&s;ive management.&mdash; We u&s;ed the freedom to &s;ugge&s;t an entire alteration in the mode of realizing the revenues. We pro|po&s;ed a con&s;iderable and immediate reduction of expences, and a total change of the principal Aumildars who had been employed under the Nabob.</P>
<P>Our ideas had the good fortune to receive your approbation; but the removal of the Nabob's &s;er|vants being thought improper at that particular period of the collections, we employed our at|tention chiefly in pre&s;erving what revenue was left the country, and acquiring &s;uch materials as might lead to a more perfect knowledge of its former and pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>The&s;e pur&s;uits, as we apprehended, met with great ob&s;tructions from the conduct of the Nabob's &s;ervants. The orders they received were evaded under various pretexts; no attention was paid to the &s;trong and repeated applications made to them for the accounts of their management; and their attachment to the Company's intere&s;t appeared, in every in&s;tance, &s;o feeble, that we &s;aw no pro&s;pect whatever of &s;ucce&s;s, but in the appointment of renters under the Company's &s;ole authority.</P>
<P>Upon this principle we judged it expedient to recommend, that &s;uch of the Nabob's di&s;tricts as were in a &s;tate to be farmed out, might be imme|diately let by a public adverti&s;ement, i&s;&s;ued in the Company's name, and circulated through every province of the Carnatic; and with the view of en|couraging

bidders, we propo&s;ed, that the countries might be adverti&s;ed for the whole period of the Nabob's a&s;&s;ignment, and the &s;ecurity of the Com|pany's protection promi&s;ed, in the fulle&s;t manner, to &s;uch per&s;ons as might become renters.</P>
<P>This plan had the de&s;ired effect; and the at|tempts which were &s;ecretly made to counteract it, afforded an unequivocal proof of its nece&s;&s;ity: But the advantages re&s;ulting from it were more plea&s;ingly evinced, by the number of propo&s;als that were delivered, and by the terms which were in general offered for the di&s;tricts intended to be farmed out.</P>
<P>Having &s;o far attained the purpo&s;es of the a&s;|&s;ignment, our attention was next turned to the heavy expences entailed upon the different pro|vinces; and here, we confe&s;s, our a&s;toni&s;hment was rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch. In the Trichino|poly country, the &s;tanding di&s;bur&s;ements appeared, by the Nabob's own accounts, to be one lack of rupees more than the receipts. In other di&s;tricts, the charges were not in &s;o high a proportion, but &s;till rated on a mo&s;t extravagant &s;cale; and we &s;aw, by every account that was brought before us, the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of retrenching con&s;idera|bly in all the articles of expence.</P>
<P>Our own rea&s;on, aided by &s;uch enquiries as we were able to make, &s;ugge&s;ted the alterations we have recommended to your Lord&s;hip, &amp;c. under this head. You will ob&s;erve, that we have not acted &s;paringly; but we cho&s;e rather, in ca&s;es of doubt, to incur the hazard of retrenching too much, than too little; becau&s;e it would be ea&s;ier, after any &s;tated allowance for expences, to add what might be nece&s;&s;ary, than to dimini&s;h. We hope, however, there will be no material increa&s;e in the articles as they now &s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="119">One con&s;iderable charge upon the Nabob's country was for extraordinary &s;ibbendies, &s;epoys, and hor&s;emen, who appeared to us to be a very unnece&s;&s;ary incumbrance on the revenue. Your Lord&s;hip, &amp;c. have determined to receive &s;uch of the&s;e people as will enli&s;t into the Company's &s;er|vice, and di&s;charge the re&s;t. This mea&s;ure will not only relieve the country of a heavy burthen, but tend greatly to fix in the Company that kind of authority, which is requi&s;ite for the due collec|tion of the revenues.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of your determination re&s;pecting the Nabob's &s;epoys, &amp;c. every charge under that head has been &s;truck out of our account of ex|pences. If the whole number of the&s;e people be enli&s;ted by the Company, there will probably be no more than &s;ufficient to complete their ordinary military e&s;tabli&s;hment. But &s;hould the pre&s;ent re|duction of the Nabob's artillery render it expe|dient, after the war, to make any addition to the Company's e&s;tabli&s;hment, for the purpo&s;es of the a&s;&s;igned countries; the expence of &s;uch addition, whatever it be, mu&s;t be deducted from the pre&s;ent account of &s;avings.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the charges of the &s;everal di&s;|tricts, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h better regulations, we were careful to di&s;criminate tho&s;e incurred for troops kept, or &s;uppo&s;ed to be kept up for the de|fence of the country, from tho&s;e of the &s;ibbendy, &s;ervants, &amp;c. for the cultivation of the lands, and the collection of the revenues, as well as to pay at|tention to &s;uch of the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms of the country, ancient privileges of the inhabitants, and public charities, as were nece&s;&s;arily allowed, and appeared proper to be continued; but which, un|der the Nabob's government, were not only rated much higher, but had been blended under one

confu&s;ed and almo&s;t unintelligible title of, Ex|pences of the di&s;tricts; &s;o joined, perhaps, to afford pleas and means of &s;ecreting and appropriating great part of the revenues to other purpo&s;es than fairly appeared; and certainly betraying the ut|mo&s;t neglect and mi&s;management, as giving lati|tude for every &s;pecies of fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion. Such a &s;y&s;tem has, in the few latter years of the Nabob's nece&s;&s;ities, brought all his countries into that &s;ituation, from which nothing but the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy, &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the conduct of managers, and the mo&s;t conciliating attention to the rights of the inhabitants, can po&s;&s;ibly recover them.</P>
<P>It now only remains for us to lay before your Lord&s;hip, &amp;c. the inclo&s;ed &s;tatement of the &s;ums at which the di&s;tricts lately adverti&s;ed have been let, compared with the accounts of their produce delivered by the Nabob, and entered on our pro|ceedings of the 21&s;t January. Likewi&s;e a com|parative view of their former and pre&s;ent ex|pences.</P>
<P>The Nabob's accounts of the produce of the&s;e di&s;tricts &s;tate, as we have &s;ome rea&s;on to think, the &s;ums which former renters engaged to pay to him (and which were &s;eldom, if ever, made good) and not the &s;ums actually produced by the di&s;tricts; yet we have the &s;atisfaction to ob&s;erve, that the pre&s;ent aggregate rents, upon an average, are equal to tho&s;e accounts. Your Lord&s;hip, &amp;c. cannot indeed expect, that, in the mid&s;t of the danger, in|va&s;ion, and di&s;tre&s;s, which a&s;&s;ail the Carnatic on every &s;ide, the renters now appointed will be able at pre&s;ent to fulfil the terms of their lea&s;es; but we tru&s;t, from the mea&s;ures we have taken, that very little, if any, of the actual collections will be lo&s;t, even during the war; and that, on the return of peace and tranquillity, the renters will have it in
<PB N="13" REF="121">
their power fully to perform their re&s;pective agree|ments.</P>
<P>We much regret that the &s;ituation of the Arcot province will not admit of the &s;ame &s;ettlement which has been made for the other di&s;tricts; but the enemy being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital, toge|ther with &s;everal other &s;trong holds, and having entirely de&s;olated the country, there is little room to hope for more from it than a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the few garri&s;ons we have left there.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not fail to give our attention towards obtaining every information re&s;pecting this pro|vince, that the pre&s;ent times will permit; and to take the fir&s;t opportunity to propo&s;e &s;uch arrange|ments for the management as we may think eli|gible.</P>

<P>"ONE of them [the renters] Ram Chunder Raus, was indeed one of tho&s;e unfortunate Rajahs, who&s;e country, <HI>by being near to the territories of the Nabob,</HI> forfeited its title to independence; and became the prey of ambition and cupidity. This man, though not able to re&s;i&s;t the Company's arms, <HI>employed in &s;uch a deed at the Nabob's in&s;tiga|gation,</HI> had indu&s;try and ability. He acquired, <HI>by a &s;eries of &s;ervices,</HI> even the confidence of the Na|bob; who &s;uffered him to <HI>rent a part of the country of which he had deprived him of the property.</HI> This man had afforded no motive for his rejection by the Nabob, but that of being ready to engage with the Company; a motive mo&s;t powerful in|deed, but not to be avowed."</P>
<P>[This is the per&s;on whom the Engli&s;h in&s;truments of the Nabob of Arcot have had the audacity to charge with a corrupt tran&s;action with Lord Ma|cartney; and, in &s;upport of that charge, to pro|duce a forged letter from his Lord&s;hip's &s;teward. The charge and letter, the reader may &s;ee in this Appendix, under the proper head. It is a&s;&s;erted, by the unfortunate prince above mentioned, that the Company fir&s;t &s;ettled on the Coa&s;t of Coro|mandel
<PB N="16" REF="124">
under the protection of one of his an|ce&s;tors. If this be true (and it is far from unlike|ly) the world mu&s;t judge of the return the de|&s;cendant has met with. The ca&s;e of another of the victims, given up by the Mini&s;try, though not altogether &s;o &s;triking as the former, is worthy of attention. It is that of the renter of the province of Nellore.]</P>
<P>"IT is, with a wantonne&s;s of fal&s;hood, and in|difference to detection, a&s;&s;erted to you, in proof of the validity of the Nabob's objections, that this man's failures had already forced us to remove him; though in fact he has continued invariably in office; though our <HI>greate&s;t &s;upplies have been re|ceived from him</HI>; and that, in the di&s;appointment of your remittances [the remittances from Bengal] and of other re&s;ources, the &s;pecie &s;ent us <HI>from Nellore alone</HI> has &s;ometimes enabled us to carry on the public bu&s;ine&s;s; and that the <HI>pre&s;ent expedition again&s;t the French</HI> mu&s;t, without <HI>this</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the a&s;&s;ignment, have been laid a&s;ide, or delayed until it might have become too late."</P>
<P>[This man is by the Mini&s;try given over to the mercy of per&s;ons capable of making charges on him, "<HI>with a wantonne&s;s of fal&s;hood, and indifference to detection.</HI>" What is likely to happen to him and the re&s;t of the victims, may appear by the follow|ing.]</P>

<P>THE &s;peedy termination to which the people were taught to look, of the Company's interference in the revenues, and the vengeance denounced again&s;t tho&s;e who, contrary to the mandate of the Durbar, &s;hould be connected with them, as report|ed
<PB N="17" REF="125">
by Mr. Sulivan, may, as much as the former exactions and oppre&s;&s;ions of the Nabob in the re|venue, as reported by the commander in chief, have deterred &s;ome of the fitte&s;t men from offering to be concerned in it.</P>
<P>The timid di&s;po&s;ition of the Hindoo natives of this country was not likely to be in&s;en&s;ible to the &s;pecimen of that vengeance given by his excel|lency the Amur, who, upon the mere rumour that a Bramin, of the name of Appagee Row, had given propo&s;als to the Company for the renter&s;hip of Vellore, had the temerity to &s;end for him, and to put him in confinement.</P>
<P>"A man thus &s;eized by the Nabob's &s;eapoys within the walls of Madras, gave a general alarm; and government found it nece&s;&s;ary to promi&s;e the protection of the Company, in order to calm the apprehen&s;ions of the people.</P>

<P>IN the pro&s;ecution of our duty, we be&s;eech you to con&s;ider as an act of &s;trict and nece&s;&s;ary ju&s;tice, previous to reiteration of your orders for the &s;urrender of the a&s;&s;ignment, how far it would be likely to affect third per&s;ons, who do not ap|pear to have committed any breach of their en|gagements. You command us to compel our aumils to deliver over their re&s;pective charges as &s;hall be appointed by the Nabob, or to retain
<PB N="18" REF="126">
their tru&s;t under his &s;ole authority, if he &s;hall chu&s;e to confirm them. The&s;e aumils are really renters, they were appointed in the room of the Nabob's aumils, and contrary to his wi&s;hes; they have already been rejected by him, and are there|fore not likely to be confirmed by him. They ap|plied to this government, in con&s;equence of public adverti&s;ements in our name, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing in this in&s;tance the joint authority of the Nabob and the Company, and have entered into mutual and &s;trict covenants with us, and we with them, re|lative to the certain di&s;tricts not actually in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy; by which covenants, as they are bound to the punctual payment of their rents, and due management of the country, &s;o we, and our con&s;tituents, and the public faith, are in like manner bound to maintain them in the en|joyment of their lea&s;es, during the continuance of the term; that term was for five years, agreeably to the words of the a&s;&s;ignment, which declare that the time of renting &s;hall be for three or five years, as the governor &s;hall &s;ettle with the renters, &mdash;Their lea&s;es cannot be legally torn from them. Nothing but their previous breach of a part could ju&s;tify our breach of the whole; &s;uch a &s;tretch and abu&s;e of power would indeed not only favour of the a&s;&s;umption of &s;overeignty, but of arbitrary and oppre&s;&s;ive de&s;poti&s;m. In the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, whether the Nabob be guilty, or we be guilty, the renters are not guilty. Which ever of the con|tending parties has broken the condition of the a&s;&s;ignment, the renters have not broken the con|dition of their lea&s;es. The&s;e men, in conducting the bu&s;ine&s;s of the a&s;&s;ignment, have acted in op|po&s;ition to the de&s;igns of the Nabob, in de&s;pite of the menaces denounced again&s;t all who &s;hould dare to oppo&s;e the mandates of the Durbar ju&s;tice. Gratitude and humanity require that provi&s;ion
<PB N="19" REF="127">
&s;hould be made by you, before you &s;et the Nabob's mini&s;ters loo&s;e on the country, for the protection of the victims devoted to their vengeance.</P>
<P>Mr. Benfield, to &s;ecure the permanency of his power, and the perfection of his &s;chemes, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to render the Nabob an ab&s;olute &s;tranger to the &s;tate of his affairs. He a&s;&s;ured his highne&s;s, that full ju&s;tice was not done to the &s;trength of his &s;entiments, and the keenne&s;s of his attacks, in the tran&s;lations that were made by the Company's &s;ervants from the original Per&s;ian of his letters. He therefore propo&s;ed to him, that they &s;hould for the future be tran&s;mitted in Eng|li&s;h.&mdash;Of the Engli&s;h language or writing his highne&s;s, or the ameer, cannot read one word, tho' the latter can conver&s;e in it with &s;ufficient fluency. The Per&s;ian language, as the language of the Ma|hommedan conquerors, and of the court of Delhi, as an appendage or &s;ignal of authority, was at all times particularly affected by the Nabob:&mdash;it is the language of all acts of &s;tate, and all public tran&s;ctions, among the mu&s;&s;ulman chiefs of In|do&s;tan. The Nabob thought to have gained no incon&s;iderable point, in procuring the corre&s;pon|dence from our predece&s;&s;ors to the Rajah of Tan|jore to be changed from the Marattah language, which that Hindoo prince under&s;tands, to the Per&s;ian, which he di&s;claims under&s;tanding. To force the Rajah to the Nabob's language, was gra|tifying the latter with a new &s;pecies of &s;ub&s;er|viency. He had formerly contended with con&s;ider|able anxiety, and it was thought no incon&s;iderable co&s;t, for particular forms of addre&s;s to be u&s;ed towards him in that language. But all of a &s;udden, in favour of Mr. Benfield, he quits his former affections, his habits, his knowledge, his curio&s;ity, the increa&s;ing mi&s;tru&s;t of age, to throw him&s;elf upon the generous candour, the faithful interpretation, the
<PB N="20" REF="128">
grateful return and eloquent organ of Mr. Benfield! &mdash;<HI>Mr. Benfield relates and reads what he plea&s;es to his excellency the Ameer-ul-Omrah&mdash;his excellency com|municates with the Nabob his father, in the language the latter under&s;tands. Through two channels &s;o pure, the truth mu&s;t arrive at the Nabob in perfect refine|ment; through this double tru&s;t, his highne&s;s receives whatever impre&s;&s;ion it may be convenient to make on him: he abandons his &s;ignature to whatever paper they tell him contains, in the Engli&s;h language, the &s;en|timents with which they had in&s;pired him. He thus is &s;urrounded on every &s;ide. He is totally at their mercy, to believe what is not true, and to &s;ubscribe to what he does not mean. There is no &s;y&s;tem &s;o new, &s;o foreign to his intentions, that they may not pur&s;ue in his name, without po&s;&s;ibility of detection: for they are cautious of who approach him, and have thought prudent to decline, for him, the vi&s;its of the governor,</HI> even upon the u&s;ual &s;olemn and acceptable occa&s;ion of delivering to his highne&s;s the Company's letters. <HI>Such is the com|plete a&s;cendency gained by Mr. Benfield.</HI> It may be partly explained by the facts ob&s;erved already &s;ome years ago by Mr. Benfield him&s;elf, in regard to the Nabob, of the infirmities natural to his advanced age, joined to the decays of his con&s;titution. To this a&s;cendency, in proportion as it grew, mu&s;t chiefly be a&s;cribed, if not the origin, at lea&s;t the continuance and increa&s;e, of the Nabob's di&s;union with this pre&s;idency; a di&s;union which creates the importance, and &s;ub&s;erves the re&s;entments of Mr. Benfield; <HI>and an a&s;cedency, which, if you effect the &s;urrender of the a&s;&s;ignment, will entirely leave the exerci&s;e of power, and accumulation of fortune, at his boundle&s;s di&s;cretion; to him, and to the Ameer-ul-Omrah, and to Syed A&s;&s;am Cawn, the a&s;&s;ignment would in fact be &s;urrendered.</HI> HE WILL (IF ANY) BE THE SOUCAR SECURITY; <HI>and &s;ecurity in this country is counter&s;ecured by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. You would not

<P>WILLIAM PETRIE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> attending ac|cording to order, was a&s;ked, In what &s;tation he was in the Company's &s;ervice? he &s;aid, He went to India in the year 1765, a writer upon the Madras e&s;tabli&s;hment; he was employed, during the former war with Hyder Ali, in the capacity of payma&s;ter and commi&s;&s;ary to part of the army, and was afterwards payma&s;ter and commi&s;&s;ary to the army in the fir&s;t &s;iege of Tanjore, and the &s;ub&s;e|quent campaigns; then &s;ecretary to the &s;ecret de|partment from 1772 to 1775; he came to England in 1775, and returned again to Madras the begin|ning of 1778; he was re&s;ident at the durbar of the Rajah of Tanjore from that time to the month of May; and from that time to January 1780 was chief of Nagore and Carrecal, the fir&s;t of which was received from the Rajah of Tanjore, and the &s;econd was taken from the French.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Who &s;ent him to Tanjore? he &s;aid, Sir Thomas Rumbold, and the Secret Committee.&mdash;Being then a&s;ked, upon what errand? he &s;aid, He went fir&s;t up with a letter from the Company to the Rajah of Tanjore; he was directed to give the Rajah the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances that he &s;hould be kept in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his country, and every privilege to which he had been re&s;tored; he was likewi&s;e directed to negociate with the Rajah of Tanjore for the ce&s;|&s;ion of the &s;ea-ports and di&s;trict of Nagore, in
<PB N="23" REF="131">
lieu of the town and di&s;trict of Devicotta, which he had promi&s;ed to Lord Pigot: the&s;e were the principal, and to the be&s;t of his recollection at pre&s;ent the only objects in view, when he was fir&s;t &s;ent up to Tanjore. In the cour&s;e of his &s;tay at Tanjore other matters of bu&s;ine&s;s occurred be|tween the Company and the Rajah, which came under his management as re&s;ident at that durbar. &mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether the Rajah did deliver up to him the town and the annexed di&s;tricts of Na|gore voluntarily, or whether he was forced to it? he &s;aid, When he made the fir&s;t propo&s;ition to the Rajah, agreeable to the directions he had received from the Secret Committee at Madras, in the mo&s;t free, open, and liberal manner, the Rajah told him the &s;ea-port of Nagore was entirely at the &s;ervice of his benefactors the Company, and that he was happy in having that opportunity of te&s;ti|fying his gratitude to them; the&s;e may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be words of cour&s;e, but from every experience which he had of the Rajah's mind and conduct, whil&s;t he was at Tanjore, he has rea&s;on to believe that his declarations of gratitude to the Company were perfectly &s;incere; he &s;peaks of the town of Nagore at pre&s;ent, and a certain di&s;trict, not of the di&s;tricts to the amount of which they afterwards received. The Rajah a&s;ked him, To what amount he expected a jaghire to the Company: And the witne&s;s further &s;aid, That he acknowledged to the Committee that he was not in&s;tructed upon that head; that he wrote for orders to Madras, and was directed to a&s;k the Rajah for a jaghire to a certain amount; that this gave ri&s;e to a long ne|gociation, the Rajah repre&s;enting to him his ina|bility to make &s;uch a gift to the Company as the Secret Committee at Madras &s;eemed to expect; while he (the witne&s;s) on the other hand, was di|rected to make as good a bargain as he could for
<PB N="24" REF="132">
the Company. From the view that he then took of the Rajah's finances, from the &s;ituation of his country, and from the load of debt which pre&s;&s;ed hard upon him, he believes he at different times, in his corre&s;pondence with the government, repre|&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of their being moderate in their demands, and it was at la&s;t agreed to accept of the town of Nagore, valued at a certain annual reve|nue, and a jaghire annexed to the town, the whole amounting to 2,50,000 rupees.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whe|ther it did turn out &s;o valuable? he &s;aid, He had not a doubt but it would turn out more, as it was let for more than that to farmers at Madras, if they had managed the di&s;tricts properly, <HI>but they were &s;trangers to the manners and cu&s;toms of the people; when they came down they oppre&s;&s;ed the in|habitants, and threw the whole di&s;trict into confu&s;ion; the inhabitants, many of them, left the country, and de&s;erted the cultivation of their lands, of cour&s;e the farmers were di&s;appointed of their collections, and they have &s;ince failed, and the Company have lo&s;t a con|&s;iderable part of what the farmers were to pay for the jaghire.</HI>&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Who the&s;e farmers were? he &s;aid, One of them was the renter of the St. Thom&eacute; di&s;trict, near Madras, and the other, and the mo&s;t re&s;pon&s;ible, was a Madras duba&s;h.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Who he was duba&s;h to? He &s;aid, To Mr. Ca&s;&s;|major.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked, Whether the lea&s;e was made upon higher terms than the di&s;trict was rated to him by the Rajah? he &s;aid, It was.&mdash;Being then a&s;ked, What rea&s;on was a&s;&s;igned why the di&s;trict was not kept under the former management by amildars, or let to per&s;ons in the Tanjore country acquaint|ed with the di&s;trict? he &s;aid, No rea&s;ons were a&s;|&s;igned: he was directed from Madras to adver|ti&s;e them to be let to per&s;ons of the country; but before he received any propo&s;al, he received ac|counts
<PB N="25" REF="133">
that they were let at Madras in con&s;equence of public adverti&s;ements which had been made there: he believes, indeed, there were very few men in tho&s;e di&s;tricts re&s;pon&s;ible enough to have been entru&s;ted with the management of tho&s;e lands. &mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether, at the time he was au|thorized to negociate for Nagore in the place of Devicotta, Devicotta was given up to the Rajah? he &s;aid, No.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether the Rajah of Tanjore did not frequently de&s;ire that the di&s;tricts of Arn&eacute; and Hanymantygood&eacute; &s;hould be re&s;tored to him, agreeable to treaty, and the Company's orders to Lord Pigot? he &s;aid, Many a time; and he tran&s;mitted his repre&s;entations regularly to Ma|dras. &mdash; Being then a&s;ked, Whether tho&s;e places were re&s;tored to him? he &s;aid, Not while he was in India.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked, Whether he was not authorized and required by the Pre&s;idency at Madras to de|mand a large &s;um of money over and above the four lacks of pagodas that were to be annually paid by a grant of the Rajah, made in the time of Lord Pigot? he &s;aid, He was; to the amount, he believes, of four lacks of pagodas, common|ly known by the name of depo&s;it-money.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether the Rajah did not frequently plead his inability to pay that money? he &s;aid, He did every time he mentioned it, and complained loud|ly of the demand. &mdash; Being a&s;ked, Whether he thinks tho&s;e complaints were well founded? he &s;ays, He thinks the Rajah of Tanjore was not only not in a &s;tate of ability to pay the depo&s;it-money, but that the annual payment of four lacks of pagodas was more than his revenues could af|ford. &mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he was not fre|quently obliged to borrow money, in order to pay the in&s;talments of the annual payments, and &s;uch parts as he paid of the depo&s;it? he &s;aid, Yes,
<PB N="26" REF="134">
he was.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Where he borrowed the money? he &s;aid, He believes principally from &s;oucars or native bankers, and &s;ome at Madras, as he told him.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he told him that his credit was very good, and that he borrowed upon moderate intere&s;t? he &s;aid, That he told him he found great difficulties in rai&s;ing money, and was obliged to borrow at a mo&s;t ex|orbitant intere&s;t, even &s;ome of it at 48 <HI>per cent.</HI> and he believes not a great deal under it: <HI>he de|&s;ired him (the witne&s;s) to &s;peak to one of the &s;oucars or bankers at Tanjore, to accommodate him with a loan of money; that man &s;hewed him an account between him and the Rajah, from which it appeared that he charged</HI> 48 <HI>per cent. be&s;ides compound intere&s;t.</HI>&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether the &s;ums due were large? he &s;aid, Yes, they were con&s;iderable; though he does not recollect the amount.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether the banker lent the money? he &s;aid, He would not, unle&s;s the witne&s;s could procure him payment of his old arrears.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked, What notice did the government of Madras take of the King of Tanjore's repre|&s;entations of the &s;tate of his affairs, and his ina|bility to pay? he &s;aid, He does not recollect that, in their corre&s;pondence with him, there was any rea&s;oning upon the &s;ubject; and in his corre|&s;pondence with Sir Thomas Rumbold, upon the amount of the jaghire, he &s;eemed very de&s;irous of adopting the demand of government to the Ra|jah's circum&s;tances; but whil&s;t he &s;taid at Tan|jore, the Rajah was not exonerated from any part of his burthens.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether they ever de&s;ired the Rajah to make up a &s;tatement of his accounts, di&s;bur&s;ements, debts, and payments, to the Company, in order to a&s;certain whether the country was able to pay the increa&s;ing demands upon it? he &s;aid, Through him he is certain they
<PB N="27" REF="135">
never did.&mdash;Being then a&s;ked, If he ever heard whether they did through any one el&s;e? he &s;aid, He never did.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked, Whether the Rajah is not bound to furni&s;h the cultivators of land with &s;eed for their crops, according to the cu&s;tom of the country? he &s;aid, <HI>The king of Tanjore, as proprietor of the land, always makes advances of money for &s;eed for the cultivation of the land.</HI>&mdash;Being then a&s;ked, If mo|ney beyond his power of furni&s;hing &s;hould be ex|torted from him, might it not prevent, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the means of cultivating the country? he &s;aid, It certainly does, <HI>he knows it for a fact; and he knows that when he left the country there were &s;everal di&s;tricts which were uncultivated from that cau&s;e.</HI>&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be at a con&s;iderable expence in order to keep up the mounds and water-cour&s;es? He &s;aid, <HI>A very con&s;iderable one annually.</HI> &mdash; Being a&s;ked, What would be the con&s;equence if money &s;hould fail for that? he &s;aid, <HI>In the fir&s;t in&s;tance the country would be partially &s;upplied with water, &s;ome di&s;tricts would be overflowed, and others would be parched.</HI>&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether there is not a con&s;iderable dam, called the Anicut, on the keeping up of which the pro&s;perity of the coun|try greatly depends, and which requires a great expence? he &s;aid, Yes, there is; the whole of the Tanjore country is admirably well &s;upplied with water, nor can he conceive any method could be fallen upon more happily adapted to the culti|vation and pro&s;perity of the country; but, as the Anicut is the &s;ource of that pro&s;perity, any injury done to that mu&s;t e&s;&s;entially affect all the other works in the country; it is a mo&s;t &s;tupendous piece of ma&s;onry, but from the very great floods frequently requiring repairs, which if neglected not only the expence of repairing mu&s;t be greatly
<PB N="28" REF="136">
increa&s;ed, but a general injury done to the whole country.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether that dam has been kept in as good pre&s;ervation &s;ince the preva|lence of the Engli&s;h government as before? he &s;aid, From his own knowledge he cannot tell, but from every thing he has read or heard of the for|mer pro&s;perity and opulence of the kings of Tanjore, he &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e not.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he does not know of &s;everal attempts that have been made to prevent the repair, and even to damage the work? he &s;aid, The Rajah him&s;elf frequently complained of that to him, and he has likewi&s;e heard it from others at Tanjore.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Who it was that attempted tho&s;e acts of violence? he &s;aid, He was told it was the inhabitants of the Nabob's country adjoining to the Anicut.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether they were not &s;et on or in&s;tigated by the Nabob? he an&s;wered, The Rajah &s;aid &s;o.&mdash;And being a&s;ked, What &s;teps the Pre&s;ident and Coun|cil took to puni&s;h the authors, and prevent tho&s;e violences? he &s;aid, To the be&s;t of his recollec|tion, the Governor told him he would make en|quiries into it, but he does not know that any en|quiries were made: That Sir Thomas Rumbold, the Governor, informed him that he had laid his repre&s;entations with re&s;pect to the Anicut before the Nabob, who denied that his people had given any interruption to the repairs of that work.</P>

<P>Being a&s;ked, What he thinks the real clear receipt of the revenues of Tanjore were worth when he left it? he &s;aid, He cannot &s;ay what was the net amount, as he does not know the expence of the Rajah's col|lection, but while he was at Tanjore he under&s;tood from the Rajah him&s;elf, and from his mini&s;ters, that the gro&s;s collection did not exceed 9 lacks of pa|godas
<PB N="29" REF="137">
(&pound;. 360,000).&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he thinks the country could pay the 8 lacks of pago|das which had been demanded to be paid in the cour&s;e of one year? he &s;aid, Clearly not.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether there was not an attempt made to remove the Rajah's mini&s;ter, upon &s;ome delay in payment of the depo&s;it? he &s;aid, The Governor of Madras wrote to that effect, which he repre&s;ented to the Rajah.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Who was mentioned to &s;ucceed to the Mini&s;ter that then was, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be removed? he &s;aid, When Sir Hector Munro came afterwards to Tanjore, the old Dau|biere was mentioned, and recommended to the Rajah as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his then Dewan.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Of what age was the Daubiere at that time? he &s;aid, Of a very great age, upwards of four&s;core. &mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether a per&s;on called Kanonga Saba Pilla was not likewi&s;e named? he &s;aid, Yes, he was, he was recommended by Sir Thomas Rumbold; and one recommendation as well as I can recollect, went through me.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, What was the rea&s;on of his being recommended? he &s;aid, He undertook to pay off the Rajah's debts, and to give &s;ecurity for the regular payment of the Ra|jah's in&s;talments to the Company.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he offered to give any &s;ecurity for pre&s;erv|ing the country from oppre&s;&s;ion, and for &s;upport|ing the dignity of the Rajah and his people? he &s;aid, He does not know that he did, or that it was a&s;ked of him.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he was a per|&s;on agreeable to the Rajah? he &s;aid, He was not.&mdash; Being a&s;ked, Whether he was not a per&s;on who had fled out of the country to avoid the re&s;entment of the Rajah? he &s;aid, He was.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whe|ther he was not charged by the Rajah with mal-prac|tices, and breach of tru&s;t relative to his effects? he &s;aid, He was; but he told the Governor that he would account for his conduct, and explain every
<PB N="30" REF="138">
thing to the &s;atisfaction of the Rajah.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether the Rajah did not con&s;ider this man as in the intere&s;t of his enemies, and particularly of the Nabob of Arcot and Mr. Benfield? he &s;aid, He does not recollect that he did mention that to him; he remembers to have heard him complain of a tran&s;action between Kanonga Saba Pilla and Mr. Benfield; but he told him he had been guilty of a variety of mal-practices in his admini&s;tration, that he had oppre&s;&s;ed the people, and defrauded him.&mdash; Being a&s;ked, In what branch of bu&s;ine&s;s the Rajah had formerly employed him? he &s;aid, He was at one time, he believes, renter of the whole country, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have great influence with the Rajah, and was in fact Dewan &s;ome time.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether the nomination of that man was not par|ticularly odious to the Rajah? he &s;aid, He found the Rajah's mind &s;o exceedingly aver&s;e to that man, that he believes he would almo&s;t as &s;oon have &s;ub|mitted to his being depo&s;ed, as to &s;ubmit to the nomination of that man to be his prime mini&s;ter.</P>

<P>MR. PETRIE being a&s;ked, Whether he was in|formed by the Rajah, or by others, at Tanjore or Madras, that Mr. Benfield, whil&s;t he managed the revenues at Tanjore, during the u&s;urpation of the Nabob, did not treat the inhabitants with great rigour? he &s;aid, He did hear from the Rajah, that Mr. Benfield did treat the inhabitants with rigour during the time he had any thing to do with the admini&s;tration of the revenues of Tanjore.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, If he recollects in what particulars? he &s;aid, The Rajah particularly complained, that grain had been delivered out to the inhabitants, for the pur|po&s;es of cultivation, at a higher price than the market price of grain in the country; he cannot
<PB N="31" REF="139">
&s;ay the actual difference of price, but it &s;truck him at the time as &s;omething very con&s;iderable.&mdash; Being a&s;ked, Whether that money was all recovered from the inhabitants? he &s;aid, The Rajah of Tan|jore told him, that the money was all recovered from the inhabitants.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he did not hear that the Nabob exacted from the country of Tanjore, whil&s;t he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it? he &s;aid, From the accounts which he received at Tan|jore, of the revenues for a number of years pa&s;t, it appeared, that the Nabob collected from the country, while he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, rather more than 16 lacks of pagodas annually; whereas, when he was at Tanjore, it did not yield more than 9 lacks.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, From whence that difference aro&s;e? he &s;aid, when Tanjore was conquered for the Nabob, he has been told that many thou&s;and of the native inhabitants fled from the country, &s;ome into the &s;outhern provinces, &s;ome into the country of My&s;ore, and others into the domi|nions of the Marattas; he under&s;tood from the &s;ame authority, that while the Nabob was in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, many inhabitants from the Carnatic, allured by the &s;uperior fertility and opu|lence of Tanjore, and encouraged by the Nabob, took up their re&s;idence there, which enabled the Nabob to cultivate the whole country; and, upon the re&s;toration of the Rajah, he has heard that the Carnatic inhabitants were carried back to their own country, which left a con&s;iderable blank in the population, which was not re-placed while he was there, principally owing to an opinion which prevailed through the country, that the Rajah's government was not to be permanent, but that an|other revolution was fa&s;t approaching. During the Nabob's government the price of grain was con&s;iderably higher (owing to a very unu&s;ual &s;car|city in the Carnatic) than when he was in Tan|jore.
<PB N="32" REF="140">
&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he was ever in the Marawar country? he &s;aid, Yes; he was commi&s;|&s;ary to the army in that expedition.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether that country was much wa&s;ted by the war? he &s;aid, Plunder was not permitted to the army, nor did the country &s;uffer from its operations, ex|cept in cau&s;ing many thou&s;ands of the inhabitants who had been employed in the cultivation of the country to leave it.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he knows what is done with the palace and inhabitants of Ramnaut? he &s;aid, The town was taken by &s;torm, but not plundered by the troops; it was immediately delivered up to the Nabob's elde&s;t &s;on.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether great riches were not &s;uppo&s;ed to be in that palace and temple? he &s;aid, It was univer&s;ally believed &s;o.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, What account was given of them? he &s;aid, He cannot tell; every thing remained in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Nabob.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, What became of the chil|dren and women of the family of the prince of that country? he &s;aid, The Rajah was a minor; the government was in the hands of the Ranny, his mother; from general report he has heard they were carried to Trichinopoly, and placed in con|finement there.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he per|ceived any difference in the face of the Carnatic when he fir&s;t knew it, and when he la&s;t knew it? he &s;aid, He thinks he did, particularly in its popu|lation.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether it was better or wor&s;e? he &s;aid, It was not &s;o populous.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, What is the condition of the Nabob's elde&s;t &s;on? he &s;aid, He was in the Black Town of Madras, when he left the country.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he was entertained there in a man|ner &s;uitable to his birth and expectations? he &s;aid, No; he lived there without any of tho&s;e exterior marks of &s;plendor which princes of his rank in India are particularly fond of.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whe|ther
<PB N="33" REF="141">
he has not heard that his appointments were poor and mean? he &s;aid, He has heard that they were not equal to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ank and expectations.&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether he had any &s;hare in the govern|ment? he &s;aid, He believes none; for &s;ome years pa&s;t the Nabob has delegated mo&s;t of the powers of government to his &s;econd &s;on&mdash;Being a&s;ked, Whether the Rajah did not complain to him of the behaviour of Mr. Benfield to him&s;elf per&s;onally; and what were the particulars? he &s;aid, He did &s;o, and related to him the following particulars: About fifteen days after Lord Pigot's confinement, Mr. Benfield came to Tanjore, and delivered the Rajah two letters from the then Governor, Mr. Stratton, one public, and the other private; he demanded an immediate account of the pre&s;ents which had been made to Lord Pigot, payment of the tunkahs, which he (Mr. Benfield) had received from the Nabob upon the country; and that the Rajah &s;hould only write &s;uch letters to the Madras government as Mr. Benfield &s;hould approve, and give to him: the Rajah an&s;wered, that he did not acknowledge the validity of any demands made by the Nabob upon the country; that tho&s;e tun|kahs related to accounts which he (the Rajah) had no concern with; that he never had given Lord Pigot any pre&s;ents, but Lord Pigot had given him many; and that, as to his corre&s;pondence with the Ma|dras government, he would not trouble Mr. Ben|field, becau&s;e he would write his letters him&s;elf&mdash; That the Rajah told the witne&s;s, that by rea&s;on of this an&s;wer he was much threatened, in con&s;equence of which he de&s;ired Colonel Harper, who then commanded at Tanjore, to be pre&s;ent at his next interview with Mr. Benfield; when Mr. Benfield denied many parts of the preceding conver&s;ation, and threw the blame upon his interpreter Comroo. When Mr. Benfield found (as the Rajah informed

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Commi&s;&s;ioners amended clau&s;es for the Fort St. George di&s;patch, relative to the indeterminate rights and preten&s;ions of the Nabob of Arcot, and Rajah of Tanjore.</HEAD>
<P>IN our letter of the 28th January la&s;t, we &s;tated the rea&s;onablene&s;s of our expectation that certain contributions towards the expences of the war, &s;hould be made by the Rajah of Tanjore. Since writing that letter, we have received one from the Rajah, of the 15th of October la&s;t, which contains at length his repre&s;entations of his inability to make &s;uch further payment. We think it unnece&s;&s;ary here to di&s;cu&s;s whether the&s;e repre&s;entations are or are not exaggerated, becau&s;e, from the explanations we have given of our wi&s;hes
<PB N="36" REF="144">
for a new arrangement in future, both with the Nabob of Arcot, and the Rajah of Tanjore, and the directions we have given you to carry that arrangement into execution, we think it impolitic to in&s;i&s;t upon any demands upon the Rajah for the expences of the late war, beyond the &s;um of four lacks of pagodas annually; &s;uch a demand might tend to interrupt the harmony which &s;hould prevail between the Company and the Rajah, and impede the great objects of the general &s;y&s;tem we have already &s;o fully explained to you.</P>
<P>But although it is not our opinion that any fur|ther claim &s;hould be made on the Rajah, for his &s;hare of the extraordinary expences of the late war, it is by no means our intention in any man|ner to affect the ju&s;t claim which the Nabob has on the Rajah for the arrears due to him on ac|count of pe&s;hcu&s;h, for the regular payment of which we became guarantee by the treaty of 1762; but we have already expre&s;&s;ed to you our hopes that the Nabob may be induced to allow the&s;e ar|rears and the growing payments, when due, to be received by the Company, and carried in di&s;charge of his debt to us. You are at the &s;ame time to u&s;e every means to convince him, that when this debt &s;hall be di&s;charged, it is our intention, as we are bound by the above treaty, to exert our&s;elves to the utmo&s;t of our power to in&s;ure the con&s;tant and regular payment of it into his own hands.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erve, by the plan &s;ent to us by our go|vernor of Fort St. George, on the 30th October 1781, that an arrangement is there propo&s;ed, for the receipt of tho&s;e arrears from the Rajah, in three years.</P>
<P>We are unable to decide how far this propo&s;al may be con&s;i&s;tent with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Rajah's re&s;ources; but we direct you to u&s;e all proper means to bring the&s;e arrears to account as

&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, con&s;i&s;tently with a due attention to this con&s;ideration.</P>

<HEAD>CLAUSES H.</HEAD>
<P>You will ob&s;erve, that by the 38th &s;ection of the late act of parliament, it is enacted, That for &s;ettling upon a permanent foundation the pre&s;ent indeterminate rights of the Nabob of Arcot and the Rajah of Tanjore, with re&s;pect to each other, we &s;hould take into our immediate con&s;ideration the &s;aid indeterminate rights and preten&s;ions, and take and pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures as in our judgment and di&s;cretion &s;hall be be&s;t calculated to a&s;certain and &s;ettle the &s;ame according to the principles, and the terms and &s;tipulations contained in the treaty of 1762, between the &s;aid Nabob and the &s;aid Rajah.</P>
<P>On a retro&s;pect of the proceedings tran&s;mitted to us from your pre&s;idency, on the &s;ubject of the di&s;putes which have heretofore ari&s;en between the Nabob and the Rajah, we find the following points remain unadju&s;ted, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Whether the Jaghire of Arnee &s;hall be enjoyed by the Nabob, or delivered up either to the Rajah, or the de&s;cendants, Tremaul Row, the late Jaghiredar.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Whether the fort and di&s;trict of Hana|mantagoody, which is admitted by both parties to be within the Marawar, ought to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Nabob, or to be delivered up by him to the Rajah.</P>
<P N="3">3d. To whom the government &s;hare of the crop of the Tanjore country, of the year. 1775-6, properly belongs.</P>
<P>La&s;tly. Whether the Rajah has a right, by u&s;age and cu&s;tom, or ought, from the nece&s;&s;ity of
<PB N="38" REF="146">
the ca&s;e, to be permitted to repair &s;uch part of the Annacut, or dam and banks of the Cavery, as lie within the di&s;trict of Trichinopoly, and to take earth and &s;and in the Trichinopoly territory, for the repairs of the dam and banks within either or both of tho&s;e di&s;tricts.</P>
<P>In order to obtain a complete knowledge of the facts and circum&s;tances relative to the &s;everal points in di&s;pute, and how far they are connected with the treaty of 1762, we have with great circum|&s;pection examined into all the materials before us on the&s;e &s;ubjects, and will proceed to &s;tate to you the re&s;ult of our enquiries and deliberations.</P>
<P>The objects of the treaty of 1762 appear to be re&s;tricted to the arrears of tribute to be paid to the Nabob for his pa&s;t claims, and to the quantum of the Rajah's future tribute or pe&s;hcu&s;h; the cancelling of a certain bond given by the Rajah's father to the father of the Nabob; the confir|mation to the Rajah of the di&s;tricts of Coveladdy and Elangaud, and the re&s;toration of Tremaul Row to his jaghire of Arnee, in conde&s;cen&s;ion to the Rajah's reque&s;t, upon certain &s;tipulations, viz. That the fort of Arnee and Doby Gudy &s;hould be retained by the Nabob; that Tremaul Row &s;hould not erect any fortre&s;s, walled pagodas, or other &s;trong hold, nor any wall round his dwelling-hou&s;e, exceeding eight feet high, or two feet thick; and &s;hould in all things behave him&s;elf with due obedience to the government; and that he &s;hould pay yearly, in the month of July, unto the Nabob or his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the &s;um of ten thou&s;and rupees, the Rajah thereby becoming the &s;ecurity for Tre|maul Row, that he &s;hould in all things demean and behave him&s;elf accordingly, and pay yearly the &s;tipulated &s;um.</P>
<P>Upon a review of this treaty, the only point
<PB N="39" REF="147">
now in di&s;pute, which appears to us to be &s;o im|mediately connected with it as to bring it within the &s;trict line of our duty to a&s;certain and &s;ettle, according to the terms and &s;tipulations of the treaty, is that re&s;pecting Arnee. For although the other points enumerated may in &s;ome re&s;pects have a relation to that treaty, yet as they are foreign to the purpo&s;es expre&s;&s;ed in it, and could not be in the contemplation of the contracting parties at the time of making it, tho&s;e di&s;putes cannot in our comprehen&s;ion fall within the line of de&s;crip|tion of rights and preten&s;ions to be now a&s;certained and &s;ettled by us, according to any of the terms and &s;tipulations of it.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the jaghire of Arnee, we do not find that our records afford us any &s;atisfactory infor|mation by what title the Rajah claims it, or what degree of relation&s;hip or connection has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Rajah and the Kelledar of Arnee, &s;ave only that by the treaty of 1762 the former be|came the &s;urety for Tremaul Row's performance of his engagements &s;pecified therein, as the con|ditions for his re&s;toration to that jaghire; on the death of Tremaul Row we perceive that he was &s;ucceeded by his widow, and after her death, by his grand&s;on Seneeva&s;orow, both of whom were admitted to the jaghire by the Nabob.</P>
<P>From your minutes of con&s;ulation of the 31&s;t October 1770, and the Nabob's letter to the pre|&s;ident, of the 21&s;t March, 1771, and the two letters from Rajah Beerbur, Atchener Punt (who, we pre&s;ume, was then the Nabob's manager at Arcot) of the 16th and 18th March, referred to in the Nabob's letter, and tran&s;mitted therewith, to the pre&s;ident, we ob&s;erve that, previous to the treaty of 1762, Mr. Pigot concurred in the expe|diency of the Nabob's taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this jaghire, on account of the trouble&s;ome and refrac|tory
<PB N="40" REF="148">
behaviour of the Arnee Braminees, by their affording protection to all di&s;turbers; who, by rea&s;on of the little di&s;tance between Arnee and Arcot, fled to the former, and were there protected, and not given up, though demanded.</P>
<P>That though the jaghire was re&s;tored in 1762, it was done under &s;uch conditions and re&s;trictions as were thought be&s;t calculated to pre&s;erve the peace and good order of the place, and due obe|dience to government.</P>
<P>That neverthele&s;s the Braminees (quarrelling among them&s;elves) did afterwards, in expre&s;s vio|lation of the treaty, enli&s;t and a&s;&s;emble many thou&s;and &s;epoys, and other troops; that they erected gaddies and other &s;mall forts, provided them&s;elves with wall pieces, &s;mall guns, and other warlike &s;tores, and rai&s;ed troubles and di&s;turban|ces in the neighbourhood of the city of Arcot, and the forts of Arnee, and Shaw Gaddy; and that finally they impri&s;oned the hircarrahs of the Nabob, &s;ent with his letters and in&s;tructions, in pur&s;uance of the advice of your board, to require certain of the Braminees to repair to the Nabob of Chepauk, and though peremptorily required to re|pair thither, paid no regard to tho&s;e, or to any other orders from the Circar.</P>
<P>By the 13th article contained in the in&s;tructions given by the Nabob to Mr. Dupr&eacute;, as the ba&s;is for negotiating the treaty made with the Rajah in 1771, the Nabob required that the Arnee di&s;trict &s;hould be delivered up to the Circar, becau&s;e the Brami|nees had broken the conditions which they were to have ob&s;erved. In the an&s;wers given by the Rajah to the&s;e propo&s;itions, he &s;ays,
<Q>I am to give up to the Circar the jaghire di&s;trict of Arnee;</Q> and on the 7th of November 1771, the Rajah, by letter to Seneewa&s;orow, who appears by your con|&s;ultations and country corre&s;pondence to have been
<PB N="41" REF="149">
the grand&s;on of Tremaul Row, and to have been put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the jaghire at your recommen|dation (on the death of his grandmother) writes, acquainting him, that he had given the Arnee country then in his (Seneewa&s;arow's) po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to the Nabob, to who&s;e aumildars Seneewa&s;arow was to deliver up the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country. And in your letter to us of the 28th February 1772, you certified the di&s;trict of Arnee to be one of the countries acquired by this treaty, and to be of the e&s;timated value of two lacks of rupees per annum.</P>
<P>In our orders, dated the 12th April 1775, we declared our determination to replace the Rajah upon the throne of his ance&s;tors, upon certain terms and conditions, to be agreed upon for the mutual benefit of him&s;elf and the Company, with|out infringing the rights of the Nabob. We de|clared, that our faith &s;tood pledged by the treaty of 1762 to obtain payment of the Rajah's tribute to the Nabob; and that for the en&s;uring &s;uch pay|ment, the fort of Tanjore &s;hould be garri&s;oned by our troops. We directed that you &s;hould pay no regard to the article of the treaty of 1771, which re&s;pected the alienation of part of the Rajah's do|minions; and we declared, that if the Nabob had not a ju&s;t title to tho&s;e territories before the con|clu&s;ion of the treaty, we denied that he obtained any right thereby, except &s;uch temporary &s;ove|reignty, for &s;ecuring the payment of his expences, as is therein mentioned.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;tructions appear to have been executed in the month of April 1776; and by your letter of the 14th May following you certified to us, that the Rajah had been put into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole country his father held in 1762, when the treaty was concluded with the Nabob; but we do not find that you came to any re&s;olution either an|tecedent
<PB N="42" REF="150">
or &s;ub&s;equent to this advice, either for que&s;tioning or impeaching the right of the Nabob to the &s;overeignty of Arnee, or expre&s;&s;ive of any doubt of his title to it. Neverthele&s;s we find, that although the Board pa&s;&s;ed no &s;uch re&s;olution, yet your pre&s;ident, in his letter to the Nabob, of the 30th July, and 24th Augu&s;t, called upon his highne&s;s to give up the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Arnee to the Rajah; and the Rajah him&s;elf, in &s;everal letters to us, particularly in tho&s;e of 21&s;t October 1776, and the 7th of June 1777, expre&s;&s;ed his expecta|tion of our orders for delivering up that fort and di&s;trict to him; and &s;o recently as the 15th of October 1783, he reminds us of his former ap|plication, and &s;tates, that the country of Arnee being guaranteed to him by the Company, it of cour&s;e is his right; but that it has not been given up to him, and he therefore earne&s;tly entreats our orders for putting him into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. We al&s;o ob&s;erve, by your letter of the 14th of October 1779, that the Rajah had not then ac|counted for the Nabob's pe&s;hcu&s;h &s;ince his re|&s;toration, but had a&s;&s;igned as a rea&s;on for his withdrawing it, that the Nabob had retained from him the di&s;trict of Arnee, with a certain other di&s;trict (Hanamantagoody) which is made the &s;ubject of another part of our pre&s;ent di&s;patches.</P>
<P>We have thus &s;tated to you the re&s;ult of our enquiry into the grounds of the di&s;pute relative to Arnee; and as the re&s;earch has offered no evidence in &s;upport of the Rajah's claim, nor even any lights whereby we can di&s;cover in what degree of rela|tion&s;hip, by con&s;anginuity, ca&s;t, or other circum|&s;tances, the Rajah now &s;tands, or formerly &s;tood, with the Killidar of Arnee, or the nature of his connection with, or command over that di&s;trict, or the authority he exerci&s;ed or a&s;&s;umed previous to the treaty of 1771, we &s;hould think our&s;elves
<PB N="43" REF="151">
highly reprehen&s;ible in complying with the Rajah's reque&s;t; and the more &s;o, as it is expre&s;sly &s;tated, in the treaty of 1762, that this fort and di&s;trict were then in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Nabob, as well as the per&s;on of the Jaghiredar, on account of his di&s;|obedience, and were re&s;tored to him by the Nabob, in conde&s;cen&s;ion to the Rajah's reque&s;t, upon &s;uch terms and &s;tipulations as could not, in our judg|ment, have been impo&s;ed by the one, or &s;ubmitted to by the other, if the &s;overeignty of the one, or the dependency of the other, had been at that time a matter of doubt.</P>
<P>Although the&s;e materials have not furni&s;hed us with evidence in &s;upport of the Rajah's claim, they are far from &s;atisfactory, to evince the ju&s;tice of, or the political nece&s;&s;ity for, the Nabob's continuing to withhold the jaghire from the de&s;cendants of Tremaul Row; his hereditary right to that jag|hire &s;eems to us to have been fully recognized by the &s;tipulations of the treaty of 1762, and &s;o little doubted, that on his death, his widow was admit|ted by the Nabob to hold it, on account, as may be pre&s;umed, of the non-age of his grand&s;on and heir, Seneewa&s;arow, who appears to have been confirm|ed in the jaghire, on her death, by the Nabob, as the lineal heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his grandfather.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Seneewa&s;arow, it does not ap|pear, by any of the proceedings in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that he was concerned in the mi&s;conduct of the Braminees complained of by the Nabob in the year 1770, which rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for his high|ne&s;s to take the jaghire into his own hands, or that he was privy to, or could have prevented tho&s;e di&s;turbances.</P>
<P>We therefore direct, that if the heir of Tremaul Row is not at pre&s;ent in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the jaghire, and has not, by any violation of the treaty, or act of di&s;obedience, incurred a forfeiture thereof, he be
<PB N="44" REF="152">
forthwith re&s;tored to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, according to the terms and &s;tipulations of the treaty of 1762. But if any powerful motive of regard to the peace and tranquillity of the Carnatic &s;hall in your judg|ment render it expedient to &s;u&s;pend the execution of the&s;e orders, in that ca&s;e you are with all con|venient &s;peed to tran&s;mit to us your proceedings thereupon, with the full &s;tate of the facts, and of the rea&s;ons which have actuated your conduct.</P>
<P>We have before given it as our opinion that the &s;tipulations of the treaty of 1762 do not apply to the points remaining to be decided. But the late act of parliament having, from the nature of our connection with the two powers in the Carnatic, pointed out the expediency, and even nece&s;&s;ity, of &s;ettling the &s;everal matters in di&s;pute between them, by a &s;peedy and permanent arrangement, we now proceed to give you our in&s;tructions upon the &s;e|veral other heads of di&s;putes before enumerated.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fort and di&s;trict of Hanaman|tagoody we ob&s;erve that on the re&s;toration of the Ra|jah in 1776, you informed us in your letter of the 14th of May&mdash;
<Q>That the Rajah had been put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole of the country his father held in 1762 when the treaty was concluded with the Nabob;</Q> and on the 25th of June you came to the re&s;olution of putting the Rajah into po&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Hanamantagoody, on the ground of its ap|pearing on reference to the Nabob's in&s;tructions to Mr. Dupr&eacute; in June, 1762, to his reply, and to the Rajah's repre&s;entations of 25th March, 1771, that Hanamantagoody was actually in the hands of the late Rajah at the time of making the treaty of 1762. We have referred as well to tho&s;e papers as to all the other proceedings on this &s;ubject, and mu&s;t confe&s;s they fall very &s;hort of demon&s;trating to us the truth of that fact. And we find, by the Secret Con&s;ultations of Fort William of the 7th
<PB N="45" REF="153">
of Augu&s;t, 1776, that the &s;ame doubt was enter|tained by our Governor General and Council.</P>
<P>But whether, in point of fact, the late Rajah was or was not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Hanamantagoody in 1762, it is notorious that the Nabob had always claimed the dominion of the countries of which this fort and di&s;trict are a part.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erve, that the Nabob is now in the ac|tual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this fort and di&s;trict; and we are not warranted, by any document we have &s;een, to concur with the wi&s;hes of the Rajah to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him.</P>
<P>With regard to the government &s;hare of the crop of 1775&punc;6, we ob&s;erve by the Dobeer's memo|randum, recited in your con&s;ultations of the 13th of May, 1776, that it was the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom of the Tanjore country, to gather in the harve&s;t, and complete the collections, within the month of March; but that, for the cau&s;es therein particu|larly &s;tated, the harve&s;t (and of cour&s;e the col|lection of the government &s;hare of the crop) was delayed till the month of March was over. We al&s;o ob&s;erve, that the Rajah was not re|&s;tored to his kingdom until the 11th of April, 1776; and from hence we infer, that if the harve&s;t and collection had been fini&s;hed at the u&s;ual time, the Nabob (being then &s;overeign of the country) would have received the full benefit of that year's crop.</P>
<P>Although the harve&s;t and collection were de|layed beyond the u&s;ual time, yet we find by the proceedings of your government, and particularly by Mr. Mackay's minute of the 29th of May, 1776, and al&s;o by the Dobeer's account, that the greate&s;t part of the grain was cut down whil&s;t the Nabob remained in the government of the country.</P>
<P>It is difficult, from the contradictory allegations
<PB N="46" REF="154">
on the &s;ubject, to a&s;certain what was the preci&s;e amount of the collections made after the Nabob cea&s;ed to have the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country. But whatever it was, it appears from General Stuart's letter of the 2d of April, 1777, that it had been a&s;&s;erted with good authority, that the far greater part of the government &s;hare of the crop was plun|dered by individuals, and never came to account in the Rajah's trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>Under all the circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e, we mu&s;t be of opinion, that the government &s;hare of the crop of 1776 belonged to the Nabob, as the then reigning &s;overeign of the kingdom of Tanjore, he being, <HI>de facto,</HI> in the full and ab&s;olute po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the government thereof, and con&s;equently that the a&s;&s;ignments made by him of the govern|ment &s;hare of the crop were valid.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, we would by no means be under|&s;tood by this opinion to &s;ugge&s;t, that any further demands ought to be made upon the Rajah, in re|&s;pect of &s;uch parts of the government &s;hare of the crop as were collected by his people.</P>
<P>For, on the contrary, after &s;o great a length of time as hath elap&s;ed, we &s;hould think it highly un|ju&s;t that the Rajah &s;hould be now compelled, ei|ther to pay the &s;uppo&s;ed balances, whatever they may be, or be called upon to render a &s;pecific ac|count of the collection made by his people.</P>
<P>The Rajah has already, in his letter to Governor Stratton, of the 21&s;t of April, 1777, given his a&s;|&s;urance, that the produce of the preceding year, accounted for to him, was little more than one lack of pagodas; and as you have acquainted us, by your letter of the 14th of October, 1779, that the Rajah has actually paid into our trea&s;ury one lack of pagodas, by way of depo&s;it, on account of the Nabob's claims to the crop, till our &s;entiments &s;hould be known, we direct you to &s;urcea&s;e any further demands from the Rajah on that account.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="155">We learn by the proceedings, and particularly by the Nabob's letter to Lord Pigot, of the 6th of July, 1776, that the Nabob, previous to the re&s;toration of the Rajah, actually made a&s;&s;ign|ments, or granted tuncaws of the whole of his &s;hare of the crop to his creditors and troops; and that your government (entertaining the &s;ame opi|nion as we do upon the que&s;tion of right to that &s;hare) by letter to the Rajah of the 20th Augu&s;t, 1776, recommended to him
<Q>to re&s;tore to Mr. Benfield (one of the principal a&s;&s;ignees or tuncaw-holders of the Nabob) the grain of the la&s;t year, which was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his people, and &s;aid to be forcibly taken from them; and further, to give Mr. Benfield all rea&s;onable a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in recovering &s;uch debts as &s;hould ap|pear to have been ju&s;tly due to him from the inhabitants; and acquainted the Rajah, that it had been judged by a majority of the council, that it was the Company's intention to let the Nabob have the produce of the crop of 1776, but that you had no intention that the Rajah &s;hould be accountable for more than the go|vernment &s;hare, whatever that might be; and that you did not mean to do more than recom|mend to him to &s;ee ju&s;tice done, leaving the manner and time to him&s;elf.</Q>
Sub&s;equent re|pre&s;entations appear to have been made to the Rajah by your government on the &s;ame &s;ubject, in favour of the Nabob's mortgages.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the&s;e applications, the Rajah, in his letter to Mr. Stratton, of the 12th January, 1777, acquainted you,
<Q>that he had given orders re&s;pecting the grain which Mr. Benfield had heaped up in his country; and with regard to the money due to him by the farmers, that he had de&s;ired Mr. Benfield to bring accounts of it, that he might limit a time for the payment
<PB N="48" REF="156">
of it, proportionably to their ability, and that the nece&s;&s;ary orders for &s;topping this money out of the inhabitants &s;hare of the crop, had been &s;ent to the ryots and aumildars; that Mr. Ben|field's goma&s;tah was then pre&s;ent there, and over&s;aw his affairs; and that in every thing that was ju&s;t he (the Rajah) willingly obeyed our Governor and Council.</Q></P>
<P>Our opinion being, that the Rajah ought to be an&s;werable for no more than the amount of what he admits was collected by his people for the go|vernment &s;hare of the crop; and the proceedings before us not &s;ufficiently explaining whether, in the &s;um which the Rajah, by his before-mentioned letter of the 21&s;t April, 1777, admits to have col|lected, are included tho&s;e parts of the government &s;hare of the crop which were taken by his people from Mr. Benfield, or from any other of the a&s;&s;ig|nees, or tuncaw-holders; and uninformed as we al&s;o are, what compen&s;ation the Rajah has or has not made to Mr. Benfield, or any other of the parties from whom the grain was taken by the Rajah's people; or whether, by means of the Ra|jah's refu&s;al &s;o to do, or from any other circum|&s;tances, any of the per&s;ons di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their grain, may have had recour&s;e to the Nabob for &s;a|tisfaction; we are, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, incompetent to form a proper judgment what di&s;po&s;ition ought in ju&s;tice to be made of the one lack of pagodas depo&s;ited by the Rajah. But as our &s;entiments and intentions are &s;o fully expre&s;&s;ed upon the whole &s;ubject, we pre&s;ume you, who are upon the &s;pot, can have no doubt or difficulty in making &s;uch an application of the depo&s;it as will be con|&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e principles of ju&s;tice whereon our &s;entiments are founded. But &s;hould any &s;uch difficulty &s;ugge&s;t it&s;elf, you will &s;u&s;pend any ap|plication of the depo&s;it, until you have fully ex|plained
<PB N="49" REF="157">
the &s;ame to us, and have received our fur|ther orders.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the repairs of Annacut and banks of the Cavery, we have upon various occa|&s;ions fully expre&s;&s;ed to you our &s;entiments, and in particular, in our general letter of the 4th July 1777, we referred you to the inve&s;tigation and corre&s;pondence on that &s;ubject of the year 1764, and to the report made by Mr. James Bourchier, on his per&s;onal &s;urvey of the waters, and to &s;everal letters of the year 1765, and 1767; we al&s;o, by our &s;aid general letter, acquainted you, that it appeared to us perfectly rea&s;onable that the Rajah &s;hould be permitted to repair tho&s;e banks, and the Annacut, in the &s;ame manner as had been practi&s;ed in times pa&s;t; and we directed you to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch regu|lations, by reference to former u&s;age, for keeping the &s;aid banks in repair, as would be effectual, and remove all cau&s;e of complaint in future.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding &s;uch our in&s;tructions, the Rajah, in his letter to us of the 15th October 1783, com|plains of the de&s;truction of the Annacut; and as the cultivation of the Tanjore country appears, by all the &s;urveys and reports of our engineers employed on that &s;ervice, to depend altogether on a &s;upply of water by the Cavery, which can only be &s;ecured by keeping the Annacut and banks in repair, we think it nece&s;&s;ary to repeat to you our orders of the 4th July 1777, on the &s;ubject of tho&s;e repairs.</P>
<P>And further, as it appears, by the &s;urvey and re|port of Mr. Pringle, that tho&s;e repairs are at|tended with a much heavier expence when done with materials taken from the Tanjore di&s;trict, than with tho&s;e of Trichinopoly, and that the la&s;t-mentioned materials are far preferable to the other, it is our order, That if any occurrences &s;hould make it nece&s;&s;ary or expedient, you apply to the
<PB N="50" REF="158">
Nabob in our name, to de&s;ire that his highne&s;s will permit proper &s;pots of ground to be &s;et out, and bounded by proper marks on the Trichino|poly &s;ide, where the Rajah and his people may at all times take &s;and and earth &s;ufficient for the&s;e re|pairs; and that his highne&s;s will grant his lea&s;e of &s;uch &s;pots of land for a certain term of years to the Company, at a rea&s;onable annual rent, to the intent that through you the cultivation of the Tanjore country may be &s;ecured, without infring|ing or impairing the rights of the Nabob.</P>
<P>If any attempts have been, or &s;hall be hereafter made to divert the water from the Cavery into the Coleroon, by contracting the current of the Upper or Lower Cavery, by planting long gra&s;s, as mentioned in Mr. Pringle's report, or by any other means, we have no doubt his highne&s;s, on a proper repre&s;entation to him in our name, will prevent his people from taking any mea&s;ures detrimental to the Tanjore country, in the pro&s;pe|rity of which his highne&s;s, as well as the Com|pany, is materially intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>Should you &s;ucceed in reconciling the Nabob to this mea&s;ure, we think it but ju&s;t, that the pro|po&s;ed lea&s;e &s;hall remain no longer in force than whil&s;t the Rajah &s;hall be punctual in the payment of the annual pe&s;hcu&s;h to the Nabob, as well as the rent to be re&s;erved for the &s;pots of ground. And in order effectually to remove all future oc|ca&s;ions of jealou&s;y and complaint between the par|ties, that the Rajah on the one hand may be &s;a|tisfied that all nece&s;&s;ary works for the cultivation of his country will be made and kept in repair; and that the Nabob on the other hand may be &s;a|tisfied that no encroachment on his rights can be made, nor any works detrimental to the fertility of his country erected; we think it proper that it &s;hould be recommended to the parties, as a part
<PB N="51" REF="159">
of the adju&s;tment of this very important point, that &s;kilful engineers, appointed by the Company, be employed at the Rajah's expence to conduct all the nece&s;&s;ary works, with the &s;tricte&s;t attention to the re&s;pective rights and intere&s;ts of both parties. This will remove every probability of injury or di&s;pute; but &s;hould either party unexpectedly con|ceive them&s;elves to be injured, immediate redre&s;s might be obtained by application to the govern|ment of Madras, under who&s;e appointment the engineer will act, without any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion between the parties, which might di&s;turb that harmony which it is &s;o much the wi&s;h of the Company to e&s;tabli&s;h and pre&s;erve, as e&s;&s;ential to the pro&s;perity and peace of the Carnatic.</P>
<P>Having now, in obedience to the directions of the act of parliament, upon the fulle&s;t con&s;idera|tion of the indeterminate rights and preten&s;ions of the Nabob and Rajah, pointed out &s;uch mea&s;ures and arrangements as in our judgment and di&s;cre|tion will be be&s;t calculated to a&s;certain and &s;ettle the &s;ame, we hope, that upon a candid con&s;idera|tion of the whole &s;y&s;tem, although each of the parties may feel di&s;appointed in our deci&s;ion on particular points, they will be convinced that we have been guided in our inve&s;tigation by principles of &s;trict ju&s;tice and impartiality, and that the mo&s;t anxious attention has been paid to the &s;ub&s;tantial intere&s;ts of both parties, and &s;uch a general and comprehen&s;ive plan of arrangements propo&s;ed, as will mo&s;t effectually prevent all future di&s;&s;atisfac|tion.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>EXTRACT of a Letter from the Court of Direc|tors, to the Pre&s;ident and Council of Fort St. George, as amended and approved by the Board of Control:</HEAD>
<P>WE have taken into our con&s;ideration the &s;e|veral advices and papers received from In|dia, relative to the a&s;&s;ignment of the revenues of the Carnatic, from the conclu&s;ion of the Bengal treaty to the date of your letter in October, 1783, together with the repre&s;entations of the Nabob of the Carnatic upon that &s;ubject; and although we might contend, that the agreement &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t till we are fully reimbur&s;ed his highne&s;s's propor|tion of the expences of the war, yet from a prin|ciple of moderation and per&s;onal attachment to our old ally, his highne&s;s the Nabob of the Carna|tic, for who&s;e dignity and happine&s;s we are ever &s;olicitous, and to cement more &s;trongly, if po&s;&s;ible, that mutual harmony and confidence which our connection makes &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for our reciprocal &s;afety and welfare, <HI>and for re|moving from his mind every idea of &s;ecret de&s;ign on our part to le&s;&s;en his authority over the internal go|vernment of the Carnatic,</HI> and the collection and ad|mini&s;tration of its revenues, we have re&s;olved that the a&s;&s;ignment &s;hall be &s;urrendered; and we do ac|cordingly direct our pre&s;ident, in who&s;e name the
<PB N="53" REF="161">
a&s;&s;ignment was taken, <HI>without delay,</HI> to &s;urrender the &s;ame to his highne&s;s. But while we have adopted this re&s;olution, we repo&s;e entire confidence in his highne&s;s, that, actuated by the &s;ame motives of liberality, and feelings of old friend&s;hip and al|liance, he will chearfully and in&s;tantly accede to &s;uch arrangements as are nece&s;&s;ary to be adopted for our common &s;afety, and for pre&s;erving the re|&s;pect, rights, and intere&s;ts we enjoy in the Carna|tic. The following are the heads and principles of &s;uch an arrangement as we are deci&s;ively of opinion mu&s;t be adopted for the&s;e purpo&s;es, viz.</P>
<P>That for making a provi&s;ion for di&s;charging the Nabob's ju&s;t debts to the Company and indivi|duals (for the payment of which his highne&s;s hath &s;o frequently expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t &s;olicitude) the <HI>Nabob &s;hall give &s;oucar &s;ecurity for the punctual pay|ment, by in&s;talments,</HI> into the Company's trea&s;ury, of twelve lacks of pagodas per annum (as voluntarily propo&s;ed by his highne&s;s) until tho&s;e debts, with intere&s;t, &s;hall be di&s;charged; and &s;hall al&s;o con&s;ent that the equitable provi&s;ion lately made by the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature for the liquidation of tho&s;e debts, <HI>and &s;uch re&s;olutions and determinations</HI> as we &s;hall <HI>hereafter make,</HI> under the authority of that provi|&s;ion for the liquidation and adju&s;tment of the &s;aid debts, <HI>bon&acirc; fide</HI> incurred, &s;hall be carried into full force and effect.</P>
<P>Should any difficulty ari&s;e between his highne&s;s and our government of Fort St. George, in re&s;pect to the <HI>re&s;pon&s;ibility of the &s;oucar &s;ecurity,</HI> or the times and terms of the in&s;talments, it is our plea&s;ure that you pay obedience to the orders and re&s;olutions of our Governor General and Council of Bengal in re&s;pect thereto, not doubting but the Nabob will in &s;uch ca&s;e con&s;ent to abide by the determination of our &s;aid &s;upreme government.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="162">Although, from the great confidence we repo&s;e in the honour and integrity of the Nabob, and from an earne&s;t de&s;ire not to &s;ubject him to any embarra&s;&s;ment on this occa&s;ion, we have not pro|po&s;ed any &s;pecific a&s;&s;ignment of territory or reve|nue for &s;ecuring the payments afore&s;aid, we ne|verthele&s;s think it our duty, as well to the private creditors, who&s;e intere&s;ts in this re&s;pect have been &s;o &s;olemnly intru&s;ted to us by the late act of parlia|ment, as from regard to the debt due to the Com|pany, to in&s;i&s;t on a declaration that in the event of the failure of the &s;ecurity propo&s;ed, or in default of payment at the &s;tipulated periods, we re&s;erve to our&s;elves full right to demand of the Nabob &s;uch <HI>additional &s;ecurity,</HI> by a&s;&s;ignment on his country, as &s;hall be effectual for an&s;wering the purpo&s;es of the agreement.</P>
<P>After having conciliated the mind of the Na|bob to this mea&s;ure, and adju&s;ted the particulars, you are to carry the &s;ame into execution by a for|mal deed between his highne&s;s and the Company, according to the tenor of the&s;e in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>As the admini&s;tration of the Briti&s;h intere&s;ts and connections in India has in &s;ome re&s;pects a&s;&s;umed a new &s;hape by the late act of Parliament, and a general peace in India has been happily accom|pli&s;hed, the pre&s;ent appears to us to be the proper period, and which cannot without great impru|dence be omitted, to &s;ettle and arrange, by a ju&s;t and equitable treaty, a plan for the future defence and protection of the Carnatic, both in time of peace and war, on a &s;olid and la&s;ting foundation.</P>
<P>For the accompli&s;hment of this great and ne|ce&s;&s;ary object, we direct you, in the name of the Company, to u&s;e your utmo&s;t endeavours to im|pre&s;s the expediency of, and the good effects to be derived from this mea&s;ure, &s;o &s;trongly upon the
<PB N="55" REF="163">
minds of the Nabob and the Rajah of Tanjore, as to prevail upon them, jointly or &s;eparately, to enter into one or more treaty or treaties with the Com|pany, grounded on this principle of equity, That &aacute;ll the contracting parties &s;hall be bound to contribute jointly to the &s;upport of the military force and garri&s;ons, as well in peace as in war.</P>
<P>That the military peace e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hall be forthwith &s;ettled and adju&s;ted by the Company, in pur&s;uance of the authority and directions given to them by the late act of parliament.</P>
<P>As the payments of the troops and garri&s;ons, oc|ca&s;ional expences in the repairs and improvements of fortifications, and other &s;ervices incidental to a military e&s;tabli&s;hment, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be punc|tual and accurate, no latitude of per&s;onal a&s;&s;urance or reciprocal confidence of either of the parties on the other, be accepted or required; but the Nabob and Rajah mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;pecify particular di&s;|tricts and revenues for &s;ecuring the due and regu|lar payment of their contributions into the trea&s;ury of the Company, with whom the charge of the de|fence of the coa&s;t, and of cour&s;e the power of the &s;word, mu&s;t be exclu&s;ively intru&s;ted, with power for the Company, in ca&s;e of failure or default of &s;uch payments, at the &s;tipulated times and &s;ea&s;ons, to enter upon and po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch di&s;tricts, and to let the &s;ame to renters, to be confirmed by the Nabob and the Rajah re&s;pectively; but tru&s;ting that in the execution of this part of the arrangement no undue ob&s;truction will be given by either of tho&s;e powers, we direct that this part of the treaty be coupled with a mo&s;t po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance, on our part, of our determination to &s;upport the dignity and authority of the Nabob and Rajah, in the ex|clu&s;ive admini&s;tration of the civil government and revenues of their re&s;pective countries; and further,
<PB N="56" REF="164">
that in ca&s;e of <HI>any</HI> ho&s;tility committed again&s;t the territories of either of the contracting parties, on the coa&s;t of Coromandel, the whole revenues of their re&s;pective territories &s;hall be con&s;idered as one common &s;tock, to be appropriated in the com|mon cau&s;e of their defence&mdash;That the Company on their part &s;hall engage to refrain, <HI>during the war,</HI> from the application of any part of their revenues to any commercial purpo&s;es what&s;oever, but apply the whole, &s;ave only the ordinary charges of their civil government, to the purpo&s;es of the war&mdash;That the Nabob and the Rajah &s;hall in like manner en|gage on their parts to refrain, during the war, from the application of any part of their revenues, &s;ave only what &s;hall be actually nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;up|port of them&s;elves, and the civil government of their re&s;pective countries, to any other purpo&s;es than that of defraying the expences of &s;uch mili|tary operations as the Company may find it nece&s;|&s;ary to carry on for the common &s;afety of their in|tere&s;ts on the coa&s;t of Coromandel.</P>
<P>And to obviate any difficulties or mi&s;under|&s;tanding which might ari&s;e from leaving indeter|minate the &s;um nece&s;&s;ary to be appropriated for the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment of each of the re&s;pective powers, that the &s;um be now a&s;certained which is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to be applied to tho&s;e pur|po&s;es, and which is to be held &s;acred under every emergency, and &s;et apart, previous to the applica|tion of the re&s;t of the revenues, as hereby &s;tipulat|ed, for the purpo&s;es of mutual or common defence again&s;t any enemy, for <HI>clearing</HI> the incumbrance which may have become nece&s;&s;arily incurred in addition to the expenditure of tho&s;e revenues <HI>which mu&s;t be always deemed part of the war e&s;tabli&s;h|ment.</HI> This vve think ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as no|thing can tend &s;o much to the pre&s;ervation of peace, and to prevent the renewal of ho&s;tilities, as the
<PB N="57" REF="165">
early putting the finances of the &s;everal powers upon a clear footing; and the &s;hewing to all other powers, that the Company, the Nabob, and the Rajah, are firmly united in one common cau&s;e, and combined in one &s;y&s;tem of permanent and vi|gorous defence, for the pre&s;ervation of their re|&s;pective territories, and the general tranquillity.</P>
<P>That the whole aggregate revenue of the con|tracting, &s;hall, during the war, be under the ap|plication of the Company, and &s;hall continue as long after the war <HI>as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary, to di&s;charge the burthens contracted by it</HI>; but it mu&s;t be de|clared that this provi&s;ion &s;hall in no re&s;pect extend to deprive either the Nabob or the Rajah of the &s;ub&s;tantial authority nece&s;&s;ary to the collection of the revenues of their re&s;pective countries. But it is meant, that they &s;hould faithfully perform the conditions of this arrangement; and if a divi&s;ion of any part of the revenues, to any other than the &s;ti|pulated purpo&s;es, &s;hall take place, the Company &s;hall be entitled to take upon them&s;elves the col|lection of the revenue.</P>
<P>The Company are to engage, during the time they &s;hall admini&s;ter the revenues, to produce to the other contracting parties regular accounts of the application thereof, to the purpo&s;es &s;tipulated by the treaty, and faithfully apply them in &s;upport of the war.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, as the defence of the Carnatic is thus to re&s;t with the Company, the Nabob &s;hall be &s;atisfied of the propriety of avoiding all unnece&s;|&s;ary expence, and will therefore agree not to main|tain a greater number of troops than &s;hall be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of his dignity, and the &s;plen|dour of the Durbar, which number &s;hall be &s;peci|fied in the treaty; and if any military aid is requi|&s;ite for the &s;ecurity and collection of his revenues, other than the fixed e&s;tabli&s;hment employed to en|force
<PB N="58" REF="166">
the ordinary collections, and pre&s;erve the po|lice of the country, the Company mu&s;t be bound to furni&s;h him with &s;uch aid: the Rajah of Tan|jore mu&s;t likewi&s;e become bound by &s;imilar en|gagements, and be entitled to &s;imilar aid.</P>
<P>As, in virtue of the powers ve&s;ted in Lord Ma|cartney by the agreement of December 1781, &s;un|dry lea&s;es, of various periods, have been granted to renters, we direct that you apply to the Nabob, in our name, for his con&s;ent, that they may <HI>per|mitted</HI> to hold their lea&s;es to the end of the &s;tipu|lated term <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the ground of this "great reliance," &s;ee the papers in this Appendix, beginning p. 15; as al&s;o the Nabob's letters to the Court of Directors, in this Appendix.</NOTE>; and we have great reliance on the li|berality and &s;pirit of accommodation manife&s;ted by the Nabob on &s;o many occa&s;ions, that he will be di&s;po&s;ed to acquie&s;ce in a propo&s;ition &s;o <HI>ju&s;t and rea&s;onable</HI>; but if, contrary to our expectations, his Highne&s;s &s;hould be impre&s;&s;ed with any particular aver&s;ion to comply with this propo&s;ition, we do not de&s;ire you to in&s;i&s;t upon it as an e&s;&s;ential part of the arrangement to take place between us; but in that event you mu&s;t take e&s;pecial care to give &s;uch indemnification to the renters for any lo&s;s they may &s;u&s;tain, as you judge to be rea&s;on|able.</P>
<P>It equally concerns the honour of our govern|ment, that &s;uch natives as may have been put in any degree of authority over the collections, in con&s;equence of the deed of a&s;&s;ignment, and who have proved faithful to their tru&s;t, &s;hall not &s;uffer inconvenience on account of their fidelity.</P>
<P>Having thus given our &s;entiments at large, as well for the &s;urrender of the a&s;&s;ignment, as with regard to tho&s;e arrangements which we think ne|ce&s;&s;ary to adopt in con&s;equence thereof, we cannot di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject without expre&s;&s;ing our highe&s;t

approbation of the <HI>ability, moderation, and command of temper,</HI> with which our Pre&s;ident at Madras has conducted him&s;elf in the management of a very delicate and embarra&s;&s;ing &s;ituation. His conduct, and that of the Select Committee of Fort St. George, in the execution of the tru&s;t delegated to Lord Macartney, by the Nabob Mahomed Ally, has been vigorous and effectual, for the purpo&s;e of realizing as great a revenue, at a cri&s;is of nece&s;&s;ity, as the nature of the ca&s;e admitted; and the impu|tation of corruption, &s;ugge&s;ted in &s;ome of the pro|ceedings, appears to be totally groundle&s;s and un|warranted.</P>
<P>While we find &s;o much to applaud, it is with regret we are induced to advert to any thing which may appear worthy of blame, as the &s;tep of i&s;&s;uing the Torana Chits in Lord Macartney's own name can only be ju&s;tified upon the ground of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the full proof of this nece&s;&s;ity, Lord Macartney's whole cor|re&s;pondence on the &s;ubject may be referred to. Without the act here condemned, not one of the acts commended in the preceding paragraph could be performed. By referring to the Nabob's letters in this Ap|pendix it will be &s;een what &s;ort of ta&s;k a Governor has on his hands, who is to u&s;e, according to the direction of this letter,
<Q>acts of ad|dre&s;s, civility, and conciliation, and to pay, upon <HI>all</HI> occa&s;ions, the <HI>highe&s;t attention</HI></Q> to per&s;ons, who at the very time are fal&s;ely, and in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t terms, accu&s;ing him of peculation, corruption, trea&s;on, and every &s;pecies of malver&s;ation in office. The recommendation, under menaces of &s;uch behaviour, and under &s;uch circum&s;tances, conveys a le&s;&s;on the tendency of which cannot be mi&s;under&s;tood.</NOTE>; and as his Lord&s;hip had every rea&s;on to believe that the demand, when made, would be irk&s;ome and di&s;agreeable to the feelings of Maho|med Ally, every precaution ought to have been u&s;ed, and more time allowed, for proving that ne|ce&s;&s;ity, by previous acts of addre&s;s, civility, and conciliation, applied for the purpo&s;es of obtaining his authority to &s;uch a mea&s;ure. It appears to us, that more of this might have been u&s;ed; and there|fore we cannot con&s;ider the omi&s;&s;ion of it as blame|le&s;s,
<PB N="60" REF="168">
con&s;i&s;tent with our wi&s;hes of &s;anctifying no act contrary to the &s;pirit of the agreement, or derogatory to the authority of the Nabob of the Carnatic, in the exerci&s;e of any of his ju&s;t rights, in the government of the people under his authority.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, the Nabob has complained that no official communication was made to him of the peace, for near a month after the ce&s;&s;ation of arms took place. This, and every other mark of di&s;re&s;pect to the Nabob, will ever appear highly reprehen&s;ible in our eyes; and we direct that you do, upon all occa&s;ions, pay the highe&s;t attention to him and his family.</P>
<P>Lord Macartney, in his minute of the 9th of September la&s;t, has been fully under our con&s;ide|ration: we &s;hall ever applaud the prudence and fore&s;ight of our &s;ervants, which induces them to collect, and communicate to us, every opinion, or even ground of &s;u&s;picion, they may entertain, re|lative to any of the powers in India, with who&s;e conduct our intere&s;t, and the &s;afety of our &s;ettle|ments, is e&s;&s;entially connected. At the &s;ame time we earne&s;tly recommend, that tho&s;e opinions and &s;peculations be communicated to us with prudence, di&s;cretion, and all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecrecy; <HI>and the terms in which they are conveyed be expre&s;&s;ed in a manner as little offen&s;ive as po&s;&s;ible to the powers whom they may concern, and into who&s;e hands they may fall.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The delicacy here recommended in the <HI>expre&s;&s;ions</HI> concerning con|duct,
<Q>with which the &s;afety of our &s;ettlements is e&s;&s;entially con|nected, is a le&s;&s;on of the &s;ame nature with the former.</Q>
Dangerous de&s;igns, if truly &s;uch, ought to be expre&s;&s;ed according to their nature and qualities; and as for the <HI>&s;ecrecy</HI> recommended concerning the de&s;igns here alluded to, nothing can be more ab&s;urd, as they appear very fully and directly in the papers publi&s;hed by the authority of the Court of Directors in 1775, and may be ea&s;ily di&s;cerned from the pro|po&s;itions for the Bengal treaty, publi&s;hed in the Reports of the Com|mittee of Secrecy, and in the Reports of the Select Committee. The keeping of &s;uch &s;ecrets too long has been one cau&s;e of the Carnatic war, and of the ruin of our affairs in India.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="169">We next proceed to give you our &s;entiments re|&s;pecting the private debts of the Nabob; <HI>and we cannot but acknowledge,</HI> that the origin and ju&s;tice, both of the loan of 1767, and the loan of 1777, commonly called the cavalry loan, appear to us clear and indi&s;putable, agreeable to the true &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of the late act of parliament.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the loan of 1767, we are to be under&s;tood as &s;peaking of the debt as con&s;tituted by the original bonds of that year, bearing intere&s;t at &pound;.10 per cent.; and therefore, if any of the Na|bob's creditors, under a pretence that their debts made part of the con&s;olidated debt of 1767, al|though &s;ecured by bonds of a &s;ub&s;equent date, carrying an intere&s;t exceeding &pound;. 10 per cent. &s;hall claim the benefit of the following orders, we direct that you pay no regard to &s;uch claims, without our further e&s;pecial in&s;tructions for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the con&s;olidated debt of 1777, it certainly &s;tands upon a le&s;s favourable footing. So early as the 27th of March, 1769, it was or|dered by our then Pre&s;ident and Council of Fort St. George, that for the preventing all per&s;ons living under the Company's protection from hav|ing any dealings with any of the country powers, or their mini&s;ters, without the knowledge or con|&s;ent of the Board, an adverti&s;ement &s;hould be pub|li&s;hed, by fixing it up at the &s;ea-gate, and &s;ending round a copy to the Company's &s;ervants and inha|bitants, and to the different &s;ubordinates, and our garri&s;ons, and giving it out in general orders; &s;tat|ing therein, that the Pre&s;ident and Council did con&s;ider the irrever&s;ible order of the Court of Di|rectors of the year 1714 (whereby their people were prohibited from having any dealings with the country governments in money matters) to be in full force and vigour; and thereby expre&s;sly for|bidding
<PB N="62" REF="170">
all &s;ervants of the Company, and other Europeans under their juri&s;diction, to make loans, or have any money tran&s;actions with any of the princes or &s;tates in India, without &s;pecial licence and permi&s;&s;ion of the Pre&s;ident and Council for the time being, except only in the particular ca&s;es there mentioned; and declaring, that any wilful deviation therefrom &s;hould be deemed a breach of orders, and treated as &s;uch. And on the 4th of March, 1778, it was re&s;olved by our Pre&s;ident and Council of Fort St. George, that the con&s;oli|dated debt of 1777 was not, on any re&s;pect what|ever, conducted under the au&s;pices or protection of that government; and on the circum&s;tance of the con&s;olidation of the &s;aid debt being made known to us, we did, on the 23d of December, 1778, write to you in the following terms:
<Q>Your ac|count of the Nabob's private debts is very alarming; but from whatever cau&s;e or cau&s;es tho&s;e debts have been contracted or increa&s;ed, we hereby repeat our orders, that the &s;anction of the Company be on no account given to any kind of &s;ecurity for the payment or liquidation of any part thereof (except by the expre&s;s au|thority of the Court of Directors) on any ac|count or pretence whatever.</Q></P>
<P>The loan of 1777 therefore has no &s;anction or authority from us; and in con&s;idering the &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of this loan, we cannot omit to ob&s;erve, that the creditors could not be ignorant how greatly the affairs of the Nabob were at that time deranged, and that his debt to the Company was then very con&s;iderable; the payment of which the parties took the mo&s;t effectual means to po&s;t|pone, by procuring an a&s;&s;ignment of &s;uch &s;pecific revenues, for the di&s;charge of their own debts, as alone could have enabled the Nabob to have di&s;|charged that of the Company.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="171">Under all the&s;e circum&s;tances, we &s;hould be warranted to refu&s;e our aid or protection in the recovery of this loan; but when we con&s;ider the inexpediency of keeping the &s;ubject of the Nabob's debts longer afloat than is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; when we con&s;ider how much the final conclu&s;ion of this bu&s;ine&s;s will tend to promote tranquillity, credit, and circulation of property in the Carnatic; and when we con&s;ider that the debtor concurs with the creditor in e&s;tabli&s;hing the ju&s;tice of tho&s;e debts con&s;olidated in 1777 into gro&s;s &s;ums, for which bonds were given, liable to be transferred to per&s;ons different from the original creditors, and having no &s;hare or knowledge of the tran&s;|actions in which the debts originated, and of cour&s;e how little ground there is to expect any &s;ub|&s;tantial good to re&s;ult from an unlimited inve&s;ti|gation into them, we have re&s;olved &s;o far to recog|nize the ju&s;tice of tho&s;e debts, as to extend to them that protection which, upon <HI>more</HI> forcible grounds, we have &s;een cau&s;e to allow to the other two cla&s;&s;es of debts. But, although we &s;o far adopt the general pre&s;umption in their favour, as to admit them to a participation in the manner hereafter directed, we do not mean to debar you from receiving any complaints again&s;t tho&s;e debts of 1777, at the in&s;tance either of the Nabob him|&s;elf, or of other creditors injured by their being &s;o admitted, or by any other per&s;ons having a proper intere&s;t, or &s;tating rea&s;onable grounds of objection; and if any complaints are offered, we order that the grounds of all &s;uch be attentively examined by you, and be tran&s;mitted to us, together with the evidence adduced in &s;upport of them, for our final deci&s;ion; and as we have before directed, that the &s;um of twelve lacks of pagodas, to be received an|nually from the Nabob, &s;hould be paid into our
<PB N="64" REF="172">
trea&s;ury, it is our order that the &s;ame be di&s;tri|buted according to the following arrangement.</P>
<P>That the debt be made up in the following manner, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The debt con&s;olidated in 1767 to be made up to the end of the year 1784, with the current inte|re&s;t at ten <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The cavalry loan to be made up to the &s;ame period, with the current intere&s;t at 12 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The debt con&s;olidated in 1777 to be made up to the &s;ame period, with the current intere&s;t at 12 <HI>per cent.</HI> to November 1781, and from thence with the current intere&s;t at 6 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The 12 lacks annually to be received, are then to be applied,</P>
<P N="1">1. To the growing intere&s;t on the cavalry loan, at 12 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To the growing intere&s;t on the debt of 1777, at 6 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The remainder to be equally divided; one half to be applied to the extinction of the Company's debt, the other half to be applied to the payment of growing intere&s;t, at &pound;.10 <HI>per cent.</HI> and towards the di&s;charge of the principal of the debt of 1767.</P>
<P>This arrangement to continue till the principal of the debt 1767 is di&s;charged.</P>
<P>The application of the 12 lacks is then to be,</P>
<P N="1">1. To the intere&s;t of the debt 1777, as above. The remainder to be then equally divided; one half towards the di&s;charge of the current intere&s;t and principal of the cavalry loan, and the other half towards the di&s;charge of the Company's debt.</P>
<P>When the cavalry loan &s;hall be thus di&s;charged, there &s;hall then be paid, towards the di&s;charge of the Company's debt, &s;even lacks.</P>
<P>To the growing intere&s;t and capital of the 1777 loan, 5 lacks.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="173">When the Company's debt &s;hall be di&s;charged, the whole is then to be applied in di&s;charge of the debt 1777.</P>
<P>If the Nabob &s;hall be prevailed upon to apply the arrears and growing payments of the Tanjore pei&s;hcu&s;h in further di&s;charge of his debts, over and above the 12 lacks of pagodas, we direct that the whole of that payment, when made, &s;hall be applied towards the reduction of the Company's debt.</P>
<P>We have laid down the&s;e general rules of di&s;|tribution, as appearing to us founded on ju&s;tice, and the relative circum&s;tances of the different debts; and therefore we give our authority and protection to them only, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they who a&s;k our protection acquie&s;ce in the con|dition upon which it is given; and therefore we expre&s;sly order, that if any creditor of the Nabob, a &s;ervant of the Company, or being under our protection, &s;hall refu&s;e to expre&s;s his acquie&s;cence in the&s;e arrangements, he &s;hall not only be excluded from receiving any &s;hare of the fund under your di&s;tribution, but &s;hall be prohibited from taking any &s;eparate mea&s;ures to recover his debt from the Nabob, it being one great inducement to our adopting this arrangement, that the Nabob &s;hall be relieved from all further di&s;quietude by the importunities of his individual creditors, and he left at liberty to pur&s;ue tho&s;e mea&s;ures for the pro|&s;perity of his country, which the embarra&s;sments of his &s;ituation have hitherto deprived him of the means of exerting. And we further direct, that if any creditor &s;hall be found refractory, or di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;turb the arrangement we have &s;ugge&s;ted, he &s;hall be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;ervice, and &s;ent home to England.</P>
<P>The directions we have given only apply to
<PB N="66" REF="174">
the three cla&s;&s;es of debts which have come under our ob&s;ervation. It has been &s;urmi&s;ed, that the Nabob has of late contracted further debts; if any of the&s;e are due to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, we forbid any countenance or protection whatever to be given to them, until the debt is fully inve&s;tigated, the nature of it reported home, and our &s;pecial in|&s;tructions upon it received.</P>
<P>We cannot conclude this &s;ubject, without ad|verting in the &s;tronge&s;t terms to the prohibitions which have from time to time i&s;&s;ued under the au|thority of different Courts of Directors again&s;t any of our &s;ervants, or of tho&s;e under our protection, having any money tran&s;actions with any of the country powers, without the knowledge and pre|vious con&s;ent of our re&s;pective governments abroad; we are happy to find that the Nabob, &s;en&s;ible of the great embarra&s;&s;ments both to his own and the Company's affairs, which the enormous amount of their private claims have occa&s;ioned, is willing to engage not to incur any new debts with individu|als, and we think little difficulty will be found in per&s;uading his highne&s;s into a po&s;itive &s;tipulation for that purpo&s;e; and though the legi&s;lature has thus humanely interfered in behalf of &s;uch indi|viduals as might otherwi&s;e have been reduced to great di&s;tre&s;s by the pa&s;t tran&s;actions, we hereby, in the mo&s;t pointed and po&s;itive terms, repeat our prohibition upon this &s;ubject; and direct, that no per&s;on, being a &s;ervant of the Company, or being under our protection, &s;hall, on any pretence what|ever, be concerned in any loan or other money tran&s;action with any of the country powers, unle&s;s with the knowledge and expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion of our re&s;pective governments. And if any of our &s;er|vants, or others being under our protection, &s;hall be di&s;covered in any re&s;pect counteracting the&s;e orders, we &s;trictly enjoin you to take the fir&s;t op|portunity
<PB N="67" REF="175">
of &s;ending them home to England, to be puni&s;hed as guilty of di&s;obedience of orders, and no protection or a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Company &s;hall be given for the recovery of any loans connected with &s;uch tran&s;actions. Your particular attention to this &s;ubject is &s;trictly enjoined; and any con|nivance on your parts, to a breach of your orders upon it, will incur our highe&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In order to put an end to tho&s;e intrigues, which have been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully carried on at the Nabob's durbar, we repeat our prohibition in the &s;tronge&s;t terms re&s;pecting any intercour&s;e between Briti&s;h &s;ubjects and the Nabob and his family, as we are convinced that &s;uch an intercour&s;e has been carried on greatly to the detriment and expence of the Nabob, and merely to the advantage of individuals. We therefore direct, that all per&s;ons who &s;hall of|fend again&s;t the letter or &s;pirit of this nece&s;&s;ary order, whether in the Company's &s;ervice, or under their protection, be forthwith &s;ent to England.</P>

Bengal government directed to be made from a great part of the debts on certain conditions.

<P>WE think it proper, con&s;idering the particular nature of the &s;ubject, to &s;tate to you the follow|ing remarks on that part of your repre&s;entation which relates to the plan for the di&s;charge of the Nabob's debts.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. You compute the revenue which the Car|natic may be expected to produce only at twenty

lacks of pagodas. If we concurred with you in this opinion, we &s;hould certainly feel our hopes of advantage to all the parties from this arrange|ment con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed. But we tru&s;t, that we are not too &s;anguine on this head, when we place the greate&s;t reliance on the e&s;timate tran&s;|mitted to you by your Pre&s;ident of Fort St. George, having there the be&s;t means of informa|tion upon the fact, and &s;tating it with a parti|cular view to the &s;ubject matter of the&s;e para|graphs. Some allowance, we are &s;en&s;ible, mu&s;t be made for the difference of collection in the Nabob's hands, but we tru&s;t not &s;uch as to re|duce the receipt nearly to what you &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. In making up the amount of the private debts, you take in compound intere&s;t at the dif|ferent rates &s;pecified in our paragraph. This it was not our intention to allow; and le&s;t any mi&s;|conception &s;hould ari&s;e on the &s;pot, we have add|ed an expre&s;s direction, that the debts be made up with &s;imple intere&s;t only, from the time of their re&s;pective con&s;olidation.

But even on your own &s;tatement of it, if we add to the &pound;.150,000 or 3,75,000 pagodas (which you take as the an|nual proportion to be received by the Company for five years, to the end of 1789) the annual amount of the Tanjore pe&s;hcu&s;h for the &s;ame period, and the arrears on the pe&s;hcu&s;h (propo&s;ed by Lord Macartney to be received in three years); the whole will make a &s;um not falling very &s;hort of pagodas 35,00,000, the amount of pagodas 7,00,000 <HI>per annum</HI> for the &s;ame period.

if we carry our calculations farther, it will ap|pear that, both by the plan propo&s;ed by the Na|bob, and adopted in your paragraphs, and by that which we tran&s;mitted to you, the debt from the Nabob, if taken at &pound; 3,000,000, will be di&s;|charged nearly at the &s;ame period, viz. in the cour&s;e of the eleventh year. We cannot therefore be of opinion that there is the &s;malle&s;t ground for objecting to this arrangement, as injurious to the intere&s;ts of the Company, even if the mea&s;ure were to be con&s;idered on the mere ground of ex|pediency, and with a view only to the wi&s;dom of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing credit and circulation in a com|mercial &s;ettlement, without any con&s;ideration of tho&s;e motives of attention to the feelings and ho|nour of the Nabob, of humanity to individuals, and of ju&s;tice to per&s;ons in your &s;ervice, and liv|ing under your protection, which have actuated the legi&s;lature, and which afford not only ju&s;ti|fiable, but commendable grounds for your conduct.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with this conviction, we have not made any alteration in the general outlines of the arrangement which we had before tran&s;mitted to you. But, as the amount of the Nabob's reve|nue is matter of uncertain conjecture, and as it does not appear ju&s;t to us, that any deficiency &s;hould fall wholly on any one cla&s;s of the&s;e debts, we have added a direction to your government of Fort St George, that if, notwith&s;tanding the pro|vi&s;ions contained in our former paragraphs, any deficiency &s;hould ari&s;e, the payments of what &s;hall be received &s;hall be made in the &s;ame proportion which would have obtained in the divi&s;ion of the whole twelve lacks, had they been paid.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>[THE following Extracts are &s;ubjoined, to &s;hew the matter and the &s;tyle of repre&s;entation employed by tho&s;e who have obtained that a&s;cen|dency over the Nabob of Arcot, which is de&s;cribed in the above Letter, and is &s;o totally de&s;tructive of the authority and credit of the lawful Briti&s;h go|vernment at Madras. The charges made by the&s;e per&s;ons have been &s;olemnly denied by Lord Macart|ney; and, to judge from the character of the par|ties accu&s;ed and accu&s;ing, they are probably void of all foundation. But as the Letters are in the name and under the &s;ignature of a per&s;on of great rank and con&s;equence among the natives; as they contain matter of the mo&s;t &s;erious nature; as they charge the mo&s;t enormous crimes, and corruptions of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t kind, on a Briti&s;h Governor; and as they refer to the Nabob's mini&s;ter in Great Britain for proof and further elucidation of the matters complained of, common decency, and com|mon policy, demanded an enquiry into their truth or fal&s;hood. The writing is obviou&s;ly the product of &s;ome Engli&s;h pen. If, on enquiry, the&s;e charges &s;hould be made good (a thing very unlikely) the party accu&s;ed would become a ju&s;t object of ani|madver&s;ion.

EXTRACT of a Tran&s;la|tion of a Letter from the Nabob of Arcot to the Chairman of the Court of Directors of the Ea&s;t India Company.</HEAD>
<P>"FATALLY for me, and for the public inte|re&s;t, the Company's favour and my unbounded confidence have been lavi&s;hed on a man totally unfit for the exalted &s;tation in which he has been placed, and unworthy of the tru&s;ts that have been repo&s;ed in him. When I &s;peak of one who has &s;o deeply &s;tabbed my honour, my wounds bleed afre&s;h, and I mu&s;t be allowed that freedom of ex|pre&s;&s;ion which the galling reflexion of my injuries and my misfortunes naturally draw from me. Shall your &s;ervants, unchecked, unre&s;trained, and unpu|ni&s;hed, gratify their private views and ambition, at the expence of my honour, my peace, and my happi|ne&s;s, and to the ruin of my country, as well as of all your affairs? No &s;ooner had Lord Macartney obtained the favourite object of his ambition, than he betrayed the greate&s;t in&s;olence towards me, the mo&s;t glaring neglect of the common civilities and attentions paid me by all former Governors, in the wor&s;t of times, and even by the mo&s;t inveterate of my enemies. He in&s;ulted my &s;ervants, endeavoured to defame my character by unju&s;tly cen&s;uring my admini&s;tration, and extended his boundle&s;s u&s;ur|pation to the whole government of my dominions, in all the branches of judicature and police; and, in violation of the expre&s;s articles of the agree|ments,
<PB N="75" REF="187">
proceeded to &s;end renters into the coun|tries, unapproved of by me, men of bad character, and unequal to my management or re&s;pon&s;ibility. Though he is chargeable with the greate&s;t acts of cruelty, even to the &s;hedding the blood and cut|ting off the no&s;es and ears of my &s;ubjects, by tho&s;e exerci&s;ing his authority in the countries, and that even the duties of religion and public wor&s;hip have been interrupted or prevented; and though he car|ries on all his bu&s;ine&s;s by the arbitrary exertion of military force; yet does he not collect from the countries one fourth of the revenue that &s;hould be produced. The &s;tatement he pretends to hold forth of expected revenue, is totally fallacious, and can never be realized under the management of his Lord&s;hip, in the appointment of renters, totally di&s;|qualified, rapacious, and irre&s;pon&s;ible, who are ac|tually embezzling and di&s;&s;ipating the public reve|nues, that &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in the &s;upport of the war. Totally occupied by his private views, and go|verned by his pa&s;&s;ions, he has neglected or &s;acri|ficed all the e&s;&s;ential objects of public good, and by want of co-operation with Sir Eyre Coote, and refu&s;al to furni&s;h the army with the nece&s;&s;ary &s;up|plies, has rendered the glorious and repeated vic|tories of the gallant General ineffectual to the ex|pul&s;ion of our cruel enemy. To cover his in|&s;ufficiency, and veil the di&s;credit attendant on his failure in every mea&s;ure, he throws out the mo&s;t illiberal expre&s;&s;ions, and in&s;titutes unju&s;t ac|cu&s;ations again&s;t me; and, in aggravation of all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es impo&s;ed upon me, he has abetted the meane&s;t calumniators, to bring forward fal&s;e charges again&s;t me, and my &s;on Ameer-ul-Omrah, in order to create embarra&s;&s;ment, and for the di&s;|tre&s;s of my mind. My papers and writings &s;ent to you, mu&s;t te&s;tify to the whole world the malevo|lence of his de&s;igns, and the means that have been u&s;ed to forward them. He has violently &s;eized and opened all letters addre&s;&s;ed to me and my &s;er|vants,
<PB N="76" REF="188">
on my public and private affairs. My vac|keel, that attended him, according to ancient cu&s;|tom, has been ignominiou&s;ly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his pre&s;ence, and not &s;uffered to approach the go|vernment-hou&s;e. He has in the meane&s;t manner, and as he thought in &s;ecret, been tampering and intriguing with my family and relations, for the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es. And if I expre&s;s the agonies of my mind under the&s;e mo&s;t pointed injuries and oppre&s;&s;ions, and complain of the violence and in|ju&s;tice of Lord Macartney, I am in&s;ulted by his affected con&s;truction, that my communications are dictated by the in&s;inuations of others. At the &s;ame time that his con&s;cious apprehen&s;ions for his mi&s;conduct, have produced the mo&s;t abject appli|cations to me, to &s;mother my feelings, and entrea|ties to write in his Lord&s;hip's favour to England, and to &s;ubmit all my affairs to his direction. When his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions have failed to mould me to his will, he has endeavoured to effect his purpo&s;es by menaces of his &s;ecret influence with tho&s;e in power in England, which he pretends to a&s;&s;ert, &s;hall be effectual to confirm his u&s;urpation, and to deprive me and my family, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, of my rights of &s;overeignty and government for ever. To &s;uch a length have his pa&s;&s;ions and violences car|ried him, that all my family, my dependants, and even my friends and vi&s;itors, are per&s;ecuted with the &s;tronge&s;t marks of his di&s;plea&s;ure. Every &s;hadow of authority in my per&s;on is taken from me, and re&s;pect to my name di&s;couraged throughout the whole country. When an officer of high rank in his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice was &s;ome time &s;ince introduced to me by Lord Macartney, his Lord&s;hip took oc|ca&s;ion to &s;hew a per&s;onal deri&s;ion and contempt of me. Mr. Richard Sulivan, who has attended my Durbar under the commi&s;&s;ion of the Governor Ge|neral and Council of Bengal, has experienced his re&s;entment; and Mr. Benfield, <HI>with whom I have no bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and who, as he has been accu&s;tomed to do
<PB N="77" REF="189">
for many years, has continued to pay me his vi&s;its of re&s;pect, has felt the weight of his lord&s;hip's di&s;|plea&s;ure, and has had every unmerited in&s;inuation thrown out again&s;t him, to prejudice him, and deter him from paying me his compliments as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>"Thus, Gentlemen, have you delivered me over to a &s;tranger; to a man unacquainted with government and bu&s;ine&s;s, and too opinionated to learn; to a man who&s;e ignorance and prejudices operate to the neglect of every good mea&s;ure, or the liberal co-operation with any that wi&s;h well to the public intere&s;ts; to a man who, to pur&s;ue his own pa&s;&s;ions, plans, and de&s;igns, will certainly ruin all mine, as well as the Company's affairs. His mi&s;management and ob&s;tinacy have cau&s;ed the lo&s;s of many lacks of my revenues, di&s;&s;ipated and embezzled, and every public con&s;ideration &s;a|crificed to his vanity and private views. I beg to offer an in&s;tance in proof of my a&s;&s;ertions, and to ju&s;tify the hope I have, that you will cau&s;e to be made good to me all the lo&s;&s;es I have &s;u&s;tained, by the mal-admini&s;tration and bad practices of your &s;ervants, according to all the account of receipts of former years, and which I made known to Lord Macartney, among&s;t other papers of information, in the beginning of his management in the collec|tions. The di&s;trict of Ongole produced annually, upon a medium of many years, ninety thou&s;and pagodas; but Lord Macartney, <HI>upon receiving a &s;um of money from Ramchundry,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Tellinga Letter at the end of this corre&s;pondence.</NOTE> let it out to him, in April la&s;t, for the inadequate rent of 50,000 pagodas per annum, dimini&s;hing, in this di&s;trict alone, near half the accu&s;tomed revenues. After this manner hath he exerci&s;ed his powers over the countries, to &s;uit his own purpo&s;es and de&s;igns; and this &s;ecret mode has he taken to reduce the collection."</P>

<DATE>7th April 1783.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;tre&s;&s;es which I have &s;et forth in my for|mer letters, are now increa&s;ed to &s;uch an alarming pitch, by the imprudent mea&s;ures of your Gover|nor, and by the arbitrary and impolitic conduct pur&s;ued with the merchants and importers of grain, that the very exi&s;tence of the fort of Madras &s;eems at &s;take, and that of the inhabitants of the &s;ettle|ment appears to have been totally overlooked; many thou&s;ands have died, and continue hourly to peri&s;h of famine, though the capacity of one of your younge&s;t &s;ervants, with diligence and atten|tion, by doing ju&s;tice, and giving rea&s;onable en|couragement to the merchants, and by drawing the &s;upplies of grain which the northern countries would have afforded, might have &s;ecured us again&s;t all tho&s;e dreadful calamities. I had with much difficulty procured and purcha&s;ed a &s;mall quantity of rice, for the u&s;e of my&s;elf, my family, and at|tendants, and with a view of &s;ending off the great|e&s;t part of the latter to the northern countries, with a little &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in their hands. But what mu&s;t your &s;urprize be, when you learn, that even this rice was &s;eized by Lord Macartney with a mi|litary force! and thus am I unable to provide for the few people I have about me, who are driven to &s;uch extremity and mi&s;ery, that it gives me pain to behold them. I have de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to get a little rice from the northern countries for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of my people, without its being liable to &s;eizure by your &s;epoys: this even has been re|fu&s;ed me by Lord Macartney. What mu&s;t your feelings be, on &s;uch wanton cruelty exerci&s;ed to|wards

<DATE>1&s;t January, 1784.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>"I AM willing to attribute this continued u&s;ur|pation to the fear of detection in Lord Macartney: he dreads the awful day when the &s;cene of his enormities will be laid open, at my re&s;toration to my country, and when the tongues of my oppre&s;|&s;ed &s;ubjects will be unloo&s;ed, and proclaim aloud the cruel tyrannies they have &s;u&s;tained. The&s;e &s;entiments of his Lord&s;hip's de&s;igns are corrobo|rated by his &s;ending, on the 10th in&s;tant, two Gentlemen to me and my &s;on Ameer-ul-Omrah; and the&s;e Gentlemen from Lord Macartney e&s;pecial|ly &s;et forth to me, and to my &s;on, that all depend|ance on the power of the &s;uperior government of Bengal, to enforce the intentions of the Company to re&s;tore my country, was vain and groundle&s;s; that the Company confided in his Lord&s;hip's judgment and di&s;cretion, and upon his repre&s;entations, and that if I, and my &s;on Ameer-ul-Omrah, would enter into friend&s;hip with Lord Macartney, and &s;ign a paper, declaring all my charges and complaints again&s;t him to be fal&s;e, that his Lord&s;hip might be induced to write to England, that all his allega|tions again&s;t me and my &s;on were not well founded; and, notwith&s;tanding his declarations to with-hold my country, yet, on the&s;e con&s;iderations, it might be &s;till re&s;tored to me.</P>
<P>"What mu&s;t be your feelings for your ancient and faithful friend, on his receiving &s;uch in&s;ults to
<PB N="80" REF="192">
his honour and under&s;tanding from your principal &s;ervant, armed with your authority? From the&s;e manoeuvres, among&s;t thou&s;ands I have experienced, the truth mu&s;t evidently appear to you, that I have not been loaded with tho&s;e injuries and op|pre&s;&s;ions from motives of public &s;ervice, but to an&s;wer the private views and intere&s;ts of his Lord|&s;hip, and his &s;ecret agents: <HI>&s;ome papers to this point are inclo&s;ed</HI>; others, almo&s;t without number, mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to your ju&s;tice, when time and cir|cum&s;tances will enable me fully to inve&s;tigate tho&s;e tran&s;actions. This opportunity will not permit the full repre&s;entation of my load of injuries and di&s;tre&s;&s;es: I beg leave to refer you to my mini&s;ter, Mr. Macpher&s;on, for the papers, according to the inclo&s;ed li&s;t, which accompanied my la&s;t di&s;patches by the Rodney, which I fear have failed; and my corre&s;pondence with Lord Macartney, &s;ub&s;equent to that period, &s;uch as I have been able to prepare for this opportunity, are inclo&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Notwith&s;tanding all the violent acts and de|clarations of Lord Macartney, yet a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own mi&s;conduct was the &s;ole incentive to the menaces and overtures he has held out, in va|rious &s;hapes. He has been in&s;ultingly lavi&s;h in his expre&s;&s;ions of high re&s;pect for my per&s;on; has had the in&s;olence to &s;ay, that all his mea&s;ures flowed from his affectionate regard alone; has pre&s;umed to &s;ay, that all his enmity and oppre&s;|&s;ion were levelled at my &s;on, Ameer-ul-Omrah, to whom he before acknowledged every aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance: and, his Lord&s;hip being without any ju&s;t cau&s;e or foundation for complaint again&s;t us, or a veil to cover his own violences, he has now had recour&s;e to the meanne&s;s, and has dared to inti|mate of my &s;on, in order to intimidate me, and to &s;trengthen his own wicked purpo&s;es, to be in league with our enemies the French. You mu&s;t

<Q>(In the Nabob's own hand.)</Q>
<P>"P. S.

<P>"YOUR a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation will be equally rai&s;ed with mine, when you hear that your Pre&s;ident <HI>has dared,</HI> contrary to your intention, to continue to u&s;urp the privileges and hereditary powers of the Nabob of the Carnatic, your old and un&s;haken friend, and the declared ally of the King of Great Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="194">"I will not take up your time by enumera|ting the particular acts of Lord Macartney's vio|lence, cruelty, and inju&s;tice; <HI>they indeed occur too frequently, and fall upon me, and my devoted &s;ubjects and country, too thick, to be regularly related.</HI> I re|fer you to my Mini&s;ter, Mr. James M'Pher&s;on, <HI>for a more circum&s;tantial account of the oppre&s;&s;ions and enormities, by which he has brought both mine</HI> and the Company's affairs to the brink of de&s;truction. I tru&s;t that &s;uch flagrant violations of all ju&s;tice, ho|nour, and the faith of treaties, will receive the &s;e|vere&s;t marks of your di&s;plea&s;ure, and that Lord Macartney's conduct, in making u&s;e of your name and authority as a &s;anction for the continuance of his u&s;urpation, will be di&s;claimed with the utmo&s;t indignation, and followed by the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;h|ment. I conceive that his Lord&s;hip's arbitrary retention of my country and government can only originate in his <HI>in&s;atiable cravings,</HI> in his implacable malevolence again&s;t me, and through fear of de|tection, which mu&s;t follow the &s;urrender of the Carnatic into my hands, of tho&s;e nefarious pro|ceedings, which are now &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the arm of violence and power.</P>
<P>"I did not fail to repre&s;ent to the &s;upreme go|vernment of Bengal, the deplorable &s;ituation to which I was reduced, and the unmerited per&s;ecu|tions I have unremittingly &s;u&s;tained from Lord Macartney; and I earne&s;tly implored them to &s;tretch forth a &s;aving arm, and interpo&s;e that con|trouling power which was ve&s;ted in them, to check <HI>rapacity and pre&s;umption,</HI> and pre&s;erve the honour and faith of the Company from violation. The Governor General and Council not only felt the cruelty and inju&s;tice I had &s;uffered, but were greatly alarmed for the fatal con&s;equences that might re&s;ult from the di&s;tru&s;t of the country powers in the profe&s;&s;ions of the Engli&s;h, when they &s;aw the
<PB N="83" REF="195">
Nabob of the Carnatic, the friend of the Company, and the ally of Great Britain, thus &s;tripped of his rights, his dominions, and his dignity, by the mo&s;t fraudulent means, and under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip. The Bengal government had already heard both the Mharattas and the Nizam urge as an objection to an alliance with the Engli&s;h, the faithle&s;s behaviour of Lord Macartney to a prince who&s;e life had been devoted, and who&s;e trea&s;ures had been exhau&s;ted, in their &s;ervice and &s;upport; and they did not he&s;itate to give po&s;itive orders to Lord Macartney for the re&s;titution of my govern|ment and authority, on &s;uch terms as were not only &s;trictly honourable, but equally advantageous to my friends the Company; for they ju&s;tly thought that my honour and dignity, and <HI>&s;overeign rights,</HI> were the fir&s;t objects of my wi&s;hes and am|bition: But how can I paint my a&s;toni&s;hment at Lord Macartney's pre&s;umption, in continuing his u&s;urpation, after their po&s;itive and reiterated man|dates! and as if, nettled by their interference, which he di&s;dained, in redoubling the fury of his violence, and &s;acrificing the public and my&s;elf, to his malice and ungovernable pa&s;&s;ions!</P>
<P>"I am, Gentlemen, at a lo&s;s to conceive where his u&s;urpation will &s;top, and have an end; has he not &s;olemnly declared that the a&s;&s;ignment was only made for the &s;upport of war? and if neither your in&s;tructions, nor the orders of his &s;uperiors at Ben|gal, were to be con&s;idered as effectual, has not the treaty of peace virtually determined the period of his tyrannical admini&s;tration? but &s;o far from &s;ur|rendering the Carnatic into my hands, he has, &s;ince that event, affixed adverti&s;ements to the walls and gates of the Black Town, for letting to the be&s;t bidder the various di&s;tricts, for the term of three years; and has continued the Committee of Reve|nue, which you po&s;itively ordered to be aboli&s;hed, to

<DATE>14th January 1784.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>"I REFER you, Gentlemen, to my inclo&s;ed du|plicate, as well as to my mini&s;ter Mr. M'Pher&s;on, for the particulars of my &s;ufferings. There is no word or action of mine that is not perverted; and though it was my intention to have &s;ent my &s;on, Ameer-ul-Omrah, who is well ver&s;ed in my affairs, to Bengal, to impre&s;s tho&s;e Gentlemen with a full &s;en&s;e of my &s;ituation, yet I find my&s;elf obliged to lay it a&s;ide, from the in&s;inuations of the calumniat|ing tongue of Lord Macartney, that takes every licence to traduce every action of my life, and that of my &s;on. I am informed that Lord Ma|cartney, at this late moment, intends to write a letter; I am ignorant of the &s;ubject; but fully perceive, that by delaying to &s;end it till the very eve of the di&s;patch, he means to deprive me of all po&s;&s;ibility of communicating my reply, and for|warding it for the information of my friends in England. Con&s;cious of the weak ground on which he &s;tands, he is obliged to have recour&s;e to the&s;e artifices to mi&s;lead the judgment, and &s;upport for a time his unju&s;tifiable mea&s;ures by deceit and im|po&s;ition. I wi&s;h only to meet and combat his charges and allegations fairly and openly; and I have repeatedly and urgently demanded to be furni&s;hed with copies of tho&s;e parts of his <HI>fabri|cated</HI> records relative to my&s;elf; but as he well knows I &s;hould refute his &s;ophi&s;try, I cannot be &s;urpri&s;ed at his refu&s;al, though I lament that it prevents you, Gentlemen, from a clear inve&s;tigation of his conduct towards me.</P>

<DATE>1&s;t Sep|tember 1783.</DATE>
Inclo&s;ed in the Nabob's Letter to the Court of Directors,
<DATE>September 1783.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>"I HAVE repeatedly repre&s;ented to your high|ne&s;s the violences and oppre&s;&s;ions exerci&s;ed by the pre&s;ent Amildar [Collector of Revenue] of Lord Macartney's appointment, over the few remaining inhabitants of the di&s;trict of Vellore, Ambore, Saulguda, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"The outrages and violences now committed are of that a&s;toni&s;hing nature as were never known or heard of during the admini&s;tration of the Circar. Hyder Naik, the cruele&s;t of tyrants, u&s;ed every kind of oppre&s;&s;ion in the Circar countries; but even his mea&s;ures were not like tho&s;e now pur&s;ued. Such of the inhabitants as had e&s;caped the &s;word and pillage of Hyder Naik, by taking refuge in the woods, and within the walls of Vellore, &amp;c. on the arrival of Lord Macartney's Amildar to Vellore, and in con&s;equence of his cowle of protec|tion and &s;upport, they mo&s;t chearfully returned to the villages, &s;et about the cultivation of the lands, and with great pains rebuilt their cottages.&mdash;But
<PB N="90" REF="202">
now the Amildar has impri&s;oned the wives and chil|dren of the inhabitants, &s;eized the few jewels that were on the bodies of the women, and then, before the faces of their hu&s;bands, flogged them, in order to make them produce other jewels and effects, which he &s;aid they had buried &s;omewhere under ground, and to make the inhabitants bring him money, notwith&s;tanding there was yet no cultiva|tion in the country.&mdash;Terrified with the flagella|tions, &s;ome of them produced their jewels and wearing apparel of their women, to the amount of ten or fifteen pagodas, which they had hidden; others, who declared they had none, the Amildar flogged their women &s;everely, tied cords around their brea&s;ts, and tore the &s;ucking children from their teats, and expo&s;ed them to the &s;corching heat of the &s;un. Tho&s;e children died, as did the wife of <HI>Ram&s;oamy,</HI> an inhabitant of Bringpoor. Even this could not &s;tir up compa&s;&s;ion in the brea&s;t of the Amildar. Some of the children, that were &s;ome|what large, he expo&s;ed to &s;ale. In &s;hort, the violences of the Amildar are &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing, that the people, on &s;eeing the pre&s;ent &s;ituation, re|member the lo&s;s of Hyder with regret. With whom&s;oever the Amildar finds a &s;ingle mea&s;ure of <HI>natehinee</HI> or <HI>rice,</HI> he takes it away from him, and appropriates it to the expences of the <HI>Sibindy</HI> that he keeps up. No revenues are collected from the countries, but from the effects of the poor wretch|ed inhabitants. Tho&s;e <HI>ryotts</HI> [yeomen] who intended to return to their habitations, and hearing of tho&s;e violences, have fled for refuge, with their wives and children, into Hyder's country. Every day is u&s;hered in and clo&s;ed with the&s;e violences and di&s;turbances. I have no power to do any thing; and who will hear what I have to &s;ay? My bu&s;ine&s;s is to inform your highne&s;s, who are my ma&s;ter. The people bring their complaints to
<PB N="91" REF="203">
me, and I tell them I will write to your high|ne&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">[The above recited practices, or practices &s;imilar to them, have prevailed in almo&s;t every part of the mi&s;erable countries on the coa&s;t of Coromandel, for near twenty years pa&s;t. That they prevailed as &s;trongly and generally as they could prevail, under the admini&s;tration of the Nabob, there can be no que&s;tion, notwith&s;tanding the a&s;&s;ertion in the begining of the above petition&mdash;nor will it ever be otherwi&s;e, whil&s;t affairs are conducted upon the principles which influence the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem. Whether the particulars here a&s;&s;erted are true or fal&s;e, neither the Court of Directors nor their mini&s;try have thought proper to enquire. If they are true, in order to bring them to affect Lord Macartney, it ought to be proved that the complaint was made <HI>to him; and that he had refu&s;ed redre&s;s.</HI> In&s;tead of this fair cour&s;e, the complaint is carried to the Court of Directors.&mdash;The following is one of the documents tran&s;mitted by the Nabob, in proof of his charge of corruption again&s;t Lord Macartney.

It was formerly the Nabob's intention to give this bu&s;ine&s;s to you, as the Governor knows full well, but did not at that time agree to it, which you mu&s;t be well ac|quainted with.</P>
<P>Your Pea&s;her Vancatroyloo is a very careful good man&mdash;he is well experienced in bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash; <HI>he has bound me by an oath to keep all this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ecret, and that his own, yours, and my lives are re|&s;pon&s;ible for it.</HI> I write this letter to you with the greate&s;t reluctance, and I &s;ignified the &s;ame to your Pea&s;her, and declared that I would not write to you by any means; to this the Pea&s;her urged, that <HI>if I did not write to his ma&s;ter, how could he know to whom he (the Pea&s;her) delivered the money,</HI> and what mu&s;t his ma&s;ter think of it? therefore I write you this letter, and &s;end it by my &s;ervant Ramanah, accompanied by the Pea&s;her's &s;ervant, and it will come &s;afe to your hands: after peru&s;al you will &s;end it back to me immediately&mdash;until I receive it I don't like to eat my victuals, or take any &s;leep.

<P>The pre&s;ent Governor is not like the former Go|vernors&mdash;he is a very great man in Europe&mdash; and all the great men of Europe are much obliged to him for his conde&s;cen&s;ion in accepting the govern|ment of this place.
