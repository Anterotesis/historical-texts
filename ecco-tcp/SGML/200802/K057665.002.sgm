<HEAD>HISTORY OF BRIEVES.</HEAD>
<P>JURISDICTION was originally a mighty &s;imple affair. The chieftain who led the hord or clan to war, was naturally appealed to in all controver&s;ies among individuals.</P>
<P>JURISDICTION involved not then what it doth at pre&s;ent, <HI>viz.</HI> a privilege to de|clare what is law, and authority to com|mand obedience. It involved no more than what naturally follows when two per|&s;ons
<PB N="4" REF="3">
differ in matter of intere&s;t, which is to take the opinion of a third.</P>
<P>THUS a judge originally was merely an umpire or arbiter, and litigation was in ef|fect a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; upon which account liti&s;|conte&s;tation is, in the Roman law, defined a judicial contract.</P>
<P>THE chieftain, who afterwards when &s;everal clans united for common defence got the name of King, was the &s;ole judge originally in matters of importance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CAESAR de&s;cribing the Germans and their manners. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Quum bellum civitas aut illatum defendit, aut infert; ma|gi&s;tratus, qui ei bello prae&s;int, ut vitae neci&s;que habeant pote&s;tatem, deliguntur.

Slighter controver&s;ies were determined by fellow-&s;ubjects; and per&s;ons di&s;tingui&s;hed by rank or office, were commonly cho&s;en umpires.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
BUT differences multiplying by multi|plied connections, and cau&s;es becoming more intricate by the art of &s;ubtilizing, the So|vereign made choice of a council to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his awards; and this council was denominated, <HI>The King's Court;</HI> becau&s;e in it he always pre&s;ided. Through mo&s;t of the European nations, at a certain period of their hi&s;tory, we find this court e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>IN the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, matters of juri&s;diction becoming &s;till more complex, and multiplying without end, the Sovereign, involved in the greater affairs of govern|ment, had not lei&s;ure nor &s;kill to decide differences among his &s;ubjects. Law be|came a &s;cience. Courts were in&s;tituted; and the &s;everal branches of juri&s;diction, ci|vil, criminal, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, were di&s;tri|buted among the&s;e courts. Their powers were a&s;certained, and the cau&s;es that could be tried by them. The&s;e were likewi&s;e called the King's courts, not only as being put in place of the King's court properly
<PB N="6" REF="5">
&s;o called, but al&s;o as the King did not re|nounce the power of judging in per&s;on, but only freed him&s;elf from the burden of nece&s;&s;ary attendance.</P>
<P>BUT the Sovereign, jealous of his royal authority, be&s;towed upon the&s;e courts no other power but that of juri&s;diction in its &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> a power to declare what is law. He re&s;erved to him&s;elf all magi|&s;terial authority, even that which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for explicating the juri&s;diction of a court. Therefore, with relation to &s;ove|reign courts, citation and execution proceed in the King's name, and by his &s;pecial au|thority.</P>
<P>AS to inferior courts, all authority is given to them that is nece&s;&s;ary for expli|cating their juri&s;diction. The tru&s;t is not great, con&s;idering that an appeal lyes to the &s;overeign court; and it is below the dig|nity of the crown, to act in an inferior court.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
IN the infancy of government, the dan|ger was not perceived, of tru&s;ting with the King, both the judicative and executive powers of the law. But it being now un|der&s;tood, that the &s;afety of a free govern|ment depends upon balancing its &s;everal powers, it has become an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, That the King, with whom the executive part of the law is tru&s;ted, has no part of the judicative power. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It &s;eems now agreed, that our Kings having delegated their whole judicial power to the judges of their &s;everal courts, they, by the con|&s;tant and uninterrupted u&s;age of many ages, have now gained a known and &s;tated juri&s;diction, regulated by certain e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, which our Kings them|&s;elves cannot make any alteration in, without an act of parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New abridgement of the law, vol. I. page 554.</NOTE>."</Q> The &s;ame, no doubt, is under&s;tood to be the law of Scotland, though &s;o late as Craig's time it was otherwi&s;e. That author<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L. 3.

<PB N="8" REF="7">
a ca&s;e, where it was declared to be law, that the King might judge even in his own cau&s;e.</P>
<P>RELIGION and law, originally &s;imple, were &s;trangers to form. In proce&s;s of time, form took the place of &s;ub&s;tance, and law, as well as religion, were involved in &s;olem|nities. What is &s;olemn and important, pro|duceth naturally order and form among the vulgar, who are addicted to objects of &s;en&s;e. For this rea&s;on, forms in mo&s;t languages are named &s;olemnities, being connected with things that are &s;olemn. But by gradual improvements in &s;ociety, and by refinement of ta&s;te, forms come in&s;en&s;ibly to be ne|glected, or reduced to their ju&s;t value; and law as well as religion are verging towards their original &s;implicity. Thus, oppo&s;ite cau&s;es produce &s;ometimes the &s;ame effects. Law and religion were originally &s;imple, becau&s;e man was &s;o. They will again be &s;imple, becau&s;e &s;implicity contributes to their perfection.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
AFTER courts were in&s;tituted, and the cognizance of all cau&s;es at that time known was di&s;tributed among them, &s;everal new grounds of action occurring, it behoved to be often doubtful, in what court a new ac|tion &s;hould be tried. An expeditious me|thod was invented, for re&s;olving doubts of this &s;ort. The King was the fountain of juri&s;diction, and to him was a&s;cribed the prerogative of delegating to what judge he thought proper, any cau&s;e of this kind that occurred. This was done by a brieve from the chancery, directed to &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hed judge, ordering him to try the particular cau&s;e mentioned in the brieve. The King at fir&s;t was under no re&s;traint as to the choice of the judge, other than what aro&s;e from rational motives; provided only, the party, who was to be made defendant, was &s;ubjected to the juri&s;diction of the judge named in the brieve. This limitation was nece&s;&s;ary; becau&s;e the King's brieve con|tained not a warrant for citing the party to appear before the judge; and the judge's
<PB N="10" REF="9">
warrant could not reach beyond his terri|tory. But in time, rea&s;on produced cu&s;tom, and cu&s;tom became law. Matters of mo|ment behoved to be delegated to a &s;upreme judge; and, in general, the rule was, to avoid mixing civil and criminal juri&s;|diction.</P>
<P>IN the mo&s;t general &s;en&s;e of the word, every one of the King's writs, commanding or prohibiting any thing to be done, is termed a brieve. But brieves, with re&s;pect to judicial proceedings, are of two kinds. One is directed to the &s;heriff, or a me&s;&s;en|ger in place of the &s;heriff, ordering him to cite the party to appear in the King's court, to an&s;wer the complaint made again&s;t him. This brieve is, in the Engli&s;h law, termed an original, and corre&s;ponds to our &s;ummons including the libel. The other kind is that above mentioned, directed to a judge, delegating to him the power of trying the particular cau&s;e &s;et forth in the brieve.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
OF the fir&s;t kind of brieve, that for breaking the King's protection, is an in|&s;tance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quon. attach. cap. 54.</NOTE>. Of the other kind, the brieve of bondage, the brieve of di&s;tre&s;s, the brieve of mortance&s;try, the brieve of nouvel di&s;&s;ei|&s;in, of perambulation, of terce, of right, &amp;c. are in&s;tances.</P>
<P>OF the la&s;t mentioned brieve the follow|ing was a peculiar &s;pecies. When in the King's court a que&s;tion of ba&s;tardy occur|red, to which a civil court is not compe|tent, a brieve was directed from the chan|cery to the bi&s;hop, to try the ba&s;tardy as a prejudicial que&s;tion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Reg. Maj. L. 2. cap. 54.</NOTE>. If &s;uch a ca&s;e hap|pened in an inferior court, the court, pro|bably by its own authority, made the remit to the &s;piritual court. And the &s;ame being done at pre&s;ent in the King's courts, there is no longer any u&s;e for this brieve.</P>
<P>THE brieve of bondage might be di|rected either to the ju&s;ticiar or to the
<PB N="12" REF="11">
&s;heriff<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quon. attach. cap. 56.</NOTE>. The brieve for relief of caution|ry, might be directed to the ju&s;ticiar, &s;he|riff, or provo&s;t and baillies within burgh<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem. cap. 51.</NOTE>. The brieves of mortance&s;try, and of nouvel di&s;&s;ei&s;in, could only be directed to the ju|&s;ticiar<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem. cap. 52 &amp; 53.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE brieve of di&s;tre&s;s, corre&s;ponding to the Engli&s;h brieve, <HI>Ju&s;ticies,</HI> mu&s;t be exa|mined more deliberately, becau&s;e it makes a figure in our law. While the practice &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted of poinding <HI>brevi mann</HI> for payment of debt, there was no nece&s;&s;ity for the interpo|&s;ition of a judge to force payment<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Tract IV.</HI> Hi&s;tory of &s;ecurities upon land for payment of debt.</NOTE>. When courts therefore were in&s;tituted, a proce&s;s for payment of debt was not known. The rough practice of forcing payment by pri|vate power being prohibited, an action be|came nece&s;&s;ary; and the King interpo&s;ed by a brieve, directing one or other judge to try the cau&s;e. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The brieve of di&s;tre&s;s for debts &s;hall be determined before the
<PB N="13" REF="12">
ju&s;ticiar, &s;heriff, baillies of burghs, as it &s;hall plea&s;e the King by his letter to com|mand them particularly within their ju|ri&s;diction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reg. Maj. L. 1. cap. 5.</NOTE>."</Q> And it may be remarked by the way, that when a decree was reco|vered under the authority of this brieve, the judge directed execution by his own authority, even &s;o far as to adjudge to the creditor, for his payment, the land of the debtor, if the moveables were not &s;ufficient. With regard to the &s;heriff at lea&s;t, the fact is a&s;certained by the act 36. p. 1469. This brieve explains a maxim of the common law of England: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Quod placita de catal|lis, debitis, &amp;c. quae &s;ummum 40<HI>&s;h.</HI> at|tingunt vel excedunt, &s;ecundum legem et con&s;uetudinem Angliae &s;ine brevi regis placitari non debent<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">New abridgment of the law, vol. I. page 646.</NOTE>."</Q> The indulging a juri&s;diction to the extent of 40 &s;hillings without a brieve, aro&s;e apparently from the hard&s;hip of compelling a creditor to take out a brieve for a &s;um &s;o &s;mall. In Eng|land
<PB N="14" REF="13">
the law continues the &s;ame to this day; for the &s;heriff, without a brieve, can|not judge in actions of debt beyond 40 &s;hillings. But in Scotland, an original ju|ri&s;diction was, by &s;tatute, be&s;towed upon the Lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion, to judge in actions of debt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 61. p. 1457.</NOTE>; and the &s;heriff and other inferior judges, copying after this court, have, by cu&s;tom and pre&s;cription, acquired an origi|nal juri&s;diction in actions of debt, without limitation; and the brieve of di&s;tre&s;s is no longer in u&s;e, becau&s;e no longer nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;ame manner, mo&s;t of the&s;e brieves have gone into de&s;uetude; for to nothing are we more prone than to an in|largement of power. A court, which has often tried cau&s;es by a delegated juri&s;dic|tion, lo&s;es in time &s;ight of its warrant, and ventures to try &s;uch cau&s;es by its own au|thority. Some few in&s;tances there are of brieves &s;till in force, &s;uch as the&s;e which found the proce&s;s of divi&s;ion of lands, of
<PB N="15" REF="14">
terce, of lyning within burgh, and of per|ambulation. For this rea&s;on I think it wrong in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to &s;u&s;tain a proce&s;s of perambulation at the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, which ought to be carried on before the &s;heriff, upon the authority of a brieve from the chancery. And what inclines me the rather to be of this opinion, is, that all the brieves of this &s;ort pre&s;erved in u&s;e, regard either the fixing of land marches, or the divi&s;ion of land among parties hav|ing intere&s;t, which never can be performed to good purpo&s;e, except upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>SOON after the in&s;titution of the college of ju&s;tice, it was made a que&s;tion, whether that court could judge in a competition about the property of land, without being authorized by a brieve of right. But they got over the difficulty upon the following con&s;ideration; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the brieve of right was long out of u&s;e; and that this being a &s;overeign and &s;upreme court for civil cau&s;es, its juri&s;diction, which in its na|ture
<PB N="16" REF="15">
is unlimited, mu&s;t comprehend all civil cau&s;es from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ult. February 1542, Weems <HI>contra</HI> Forbes, ob&s;erved by Skene (voce) Breve de recto.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>As the King's writs i&s;&s;uing from chan|cery did pa&s;s under either the Great or the Quarter Seal, &s;uch &s;olemnity came to be extremely burden&s;ome, and behoved to be &s;everely felt in the multiplication of law proceedings. This circum&s;tance was, no doubt, of influence, in antiquating the brieves that conferred a delegated juri&s;dic|tion, and in bringing all cau&s;es under &s;ome one original juri&s;diction. The other &s;ort of brieve, which is no other than the King's warrant to call the defendant into the King's court, has been very long in di&s;|u&s;e; and in place of it a &s;impler form is cho&s;en, which is a letter from the King, pa&s;&s;ing under the &s;ignet, directed to the &s;heriff, or to a me&s;&s;enger in place of the &s;heriff, ordering him to cite the party to
<PB N="17" REF="16">
appear in court. This change probably happened without an expre&s;s regulation. A few &s;ingular in&s;tances which were &s;uc|ce&s;sful, di&s;covered the conveniency; and in&s;tances were multiplied, till the form be|came univer&s;al, and brieves from the chan|cery were altogether neglected. One thing is certain, that letters under the &s;ignet for citing parties to appear in the King's courts, can be traced pretty far back. In the chartulary of Pai&s;ley, pre&s;erved in the advocates library<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 246.</NOTE>, there is a full copy of a libelled &s;ummons, in Engli&s;h, dated the 2d February 1468, at the in&s;tance of George, abbot of Pai&s;ley, again&s;t the bail|lies of the burgh of Renfrew, with re&s;pect to certain tolls, cu&s;toms, privileges, &amp;c. for &s;ummoning them to appear before the King and his council, at Edinburgh, or where it &s;hall happen them to be for the time, ending thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Given under our &s;ig|net at Perth, the &s;econd of December, and of our reign the eight year."</Q> And
<PB N="18" REF="17">
there are extant letters under the &s;ignet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2d June 1514.</NOTE>, containing a charge to enter heir to the &s;uperiority, and infeft the va&s;&s;al within twenty days; and, if he fail, &s;ummoning him to appear before the Lords of council the &s;eventh of July next, to hear him de|cerned to tyne his &s;uperiority, and that the va&s;&s;al &s;hall hold of the next lawful &s;uperior. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Given under our &s;ignet at Stir|ling, the &s;econd of June, and of our reign the fir&s;t year."</Q> It is to be ob&s;erv|ed, at the &s;ame time, that this mu&s;t have been a recent innovation; for &s;o late as the year 1457, the ordinary form of citing parties to appear before the Lords of &s;e&s;|&s;ion, was by a brieve i&s;&s;ued from chan|cery<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See act 62. p. 1457.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is probable, that originally every &s;ort of execution, which pa&s;&s;ed upon the de|crees of the King's courts, was authorized by a brieve i&s;&s;uing from chancery; for if a brieve was nece&s;&s;ary to bring the defendant
<PB N="19" REF="18">
into court, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that le&s;s &s;olemnity was u&s;ed in executing the de|cree pronounced again&s;t him; and that this in particular was the ca&s;e when land was appri&s;ed for payment of debt, is te&s;tified by 2d &s;tatutes Robert I. cap. 19. At what time this form was laid a&s;ide, or upon what occa&s;ion, we know not. For &s;o far back as we have any records, we &s;ind every &s;ort of execution, per&s;onal and real, upon the de|crees of the King's courts, authorized by letters pa&s;&s;ing the &s;ignet.</P>
<P>OF old, a certain form of words was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for every &s;ort of action; and if a man could not bring his ca&s;e under any e&s;tabli&s;hed form, he had no remedy. In the Roman law, the&s;e forms are termed <HI>formulae actionum.</HI> In Britain, copying from the Roman law, all the King's writs or brieves, the&s;e at lea&s;t which concern judi|cial proceedings, are in a &s;et form of words, which it was not lawful to alter. But in the progre&s;s of law, new ca&s;es occurring
<PB N="20" REF="19">
without end, to which no e&s;tabli&s;hed form did corre&s;pond, the Romans were forced to relax from their &s;olemnities, by indulging <HI>actiones in factum,</HI> in which the fact was &s;et forth without reference to any form. The Engli&s;h follow this practice, by indulging <HI>actions upon the ca&s;e.</HI> It is probable, that in Scotland, the warrant for citation pa&s;&s;ing under the Signet, was at fir&s;t conceived in a &s;et form, in imitation of the brieve to which it was &s;ub&s;tituted. But if this ori|ginally was the ca&s;e, the practice did not long continue. The&s;e forms have been very long neglected, every man being at liberty to &s;et forth his ca&s;e in his own words; and it belongs to the court to con|&s;ider, whether the libel or declaration be relevant; or, in other words, whether the facts &s;et forth be a ju&s;t cau&s;e for granting what is reque&s;ted by the pur&s;uer.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF PROCESS in ABSENCE.</HEAD>
<P>IN Scotland, the forms of proce&s;s again&s;t ab&s;ents, in civil and criminal actions, differ too remarkably to pa&s;s unob&s;erv|ed. Our curio&s;ity is excited to learn whence the difference has ari&s;en, and upon what principle it is founded: and for gratifying our curio&s;ity in this particular, I can think of no means more promi&s;ing, than a view of &s;ome foreign laws that have been copied by us.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
BUT in order to under&s;tand the &s;pirit of the&s;e laws, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to look back upon the origin of civil juri&s;diction, of which I have had occa&s;ion, in a former tract, to give a &s;ketch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Criminal Law.</NOTE>; <HI>viz.</HI> that at fir&s;t judges were con&s;idered as arbiters, without any magi&s;terial powers; that their autho|rity was derived from the con&s;ent of the litigants; that liti&s;conte&s;tation was in reali|ty a judicial contract; and therefore, that the decrees of judges had not a &s;tronger effect than an award pronounced by an ar|biter properly &s;o called. Upon this &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;diction, there cannot be &s;uch a thing as a proce&s;s in ab&s;ence; for a judge, who&s;e authority depends upon con&s;ent, cannot give judgment again&s;t any per&s;on who &s;ubmits not to his juri&s;diction. But civil juri&s;dic|tion, like other human inventions, faint and imperfect in its commencement, was improved in cour&s;e of time, and became a more u&s;eful &s;y&s;tem. After a publick was recognized, and a power in the publick to
<PB N="23" REF="22">
give laws to the &s;ociety, and to direct its operations, the con&s;ent of litigants was no longer nece&s;&s;ary to found juri&s;diction. A judge is held to be a public officer, hav|ing authority from the publick to &s;ettle controver&s;ies among individuals, and to ob|lige them to &s;ubmit to his decrees. The defendant, being bound to &s;ubmit to the authority of the court, cannot hurt the pur&s;uer by refu&s;ing to appear; and hence a proce&s;s in ab&s;ence again&s;t a per&s;on who is legally cited.</P>
<P>IN the primitive &s;tate of Rome, juri&s;dic|tion was altogether voluntary. A judge had no coercive power, not even that of citation. The fir&s;t dawn of authority we di&s;cover in old Rome, with relation to ju|dicial proceedings, is a power which was given to the claimant to drag his party into court, <HI>obtorto collo,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ed in the Roman law. This was a very rude form, &s;uitable however to the ignorance and rough manners of tho&s;e times. This glimp&s;e of
<PB N="24" REF="23">
authority was improved, by transferring the power of forcing a defendant into court, from the claimant to the judge; and this was a natural tran&s;ition, after a judge was held to be a publick officer, ve&s;ted with every branch of authority that is nece&s;&s;ary to explicate his juri&s;diction. Liti&s;conte&s;ta|tion cea&s;ed to be a judicial contract. But as our notions do not immediately accom|modate them&s;elves to the fluctuation of things, liti&s;conte&s;tation continued to be handled by lawyers as a judicial contract, long after juri&s;diction was authoritative, and neither inferred nor required con&s;ent. Liti&s;conte&s;tation, it is true, could no longer be reckoned a contract: but then, as any &s;ubterfuge will &s;erve a lawyer, it was defin|ed to be a <HI>qua&s;i</HI>-contract; which, in plain language, is &s;aying, that it hath nothing of a contract except the name. We re|turn to the hi&s;tory. The power of cita|tion a&s;&s;umed by the judge, was at fir&s;t, like mo&s;t innovations, exerci&s;ed with remark|able moderation. The defendant in civil
<PB N="25" REF="24">
cau&s;es behoved, for the mo&s;t part, to be cited no fewer than four times, before he was bound to put in his an&s;wer.

<P>IN criminal actions, the form of proceed|ing again&s;t ab&s;ents, appears not, among the Romans, to have been thoroughly &s;ettled.

Ulpian, to reconcile the&s;e two oppo&s;ite opinions, labours at a di&s;tinction; admits, as to le&s;&s;er crimes, that a per&s;on accu&s;ed may be condemned in ab|&s;ence; but is of opinion, that of a capital crime no man ought to be condemned in ab&s;ence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 5. de poenis.</NOTE>.

THIS form of proceeding, as to civil actions at lea&s;t, appears to have a good foundation both in ju&s;tice and expediency. If my neighbour refu&s;e to do me ju&s;tice, it is the part of the judge or magi&s;trate to compel him. If my neighbour be con|tumacious, and refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to legal authority, this may &s;ubject him to puni&s;h|ment, but cannot impair my right. In criminal cau&s;es, where puni&s;hment alone is in view, there is more room for he&s;itat|ing. No individual hath an intere&s;t &s;o &s;ub&s;tantial, as to make a pro&s;ecution nece&s;|&s;ary merely upon his account; and there|fore writers of a mild temper, &s;atisfy them|&s;elves with puni&s;hing the per&s;on accu&s;ed for his contumacy. Others, of more &s;evere manners, are for proceeding to a trial in every ca&s;e which is not capital.</P>
<P>THAT a difference &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed between civil and criminal actions, in the form of proceeding, is extremely rational. I cannot however help te&s;tifying &s;ome de|gree
<PB N="28" REF="27">
of &s;urpri&s;e, at an opinion, which gives peculiar indulgence to the more atrocious crimes. I &s;hould rather have expected, that the horror mankind naturally have at &s;uch crimes, would have di&s;po&s;ed the&s;e writers, to break through every impediment, in or|der to reach a condign puni&s;hment; leav|ing crimes which make a le&s;s figure, to be pro&s;ecuted in the ordinary form. Nature and plain &s;en&s;e undoubtedly &s;ugge&s;t this dif|ference. But the&s;e matters were at Rome &s;ettled by lawyers, who are led more by general principles, than by plain &s;en&s;ations. And as the form of civil actions, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, analogy moved them to bring pecuniary mulcts, and con&s;equently all the le&s;&s;er crimes, under the &s;ame form.</P>
<P>I reckon it no &s;light &s;upport to the fore|going reflection, that as to high trea&s;on, the greate&s;t of all crimes, the Roman law|yers, de&s;erting their favourite doctrine, per|mitted action to proceed upon this crime,

<P>So far back as we can trace the laws of this i&s;land, by the help of ancient writings and records, we find judges ve&s;ted with au|thority to explicate their juri&s;diction. We find, at the &s;ame time, the original notion of juri&s;diction &s;o far prevalent, as to make it a rule, that no cau&s;e could be tried in ab&s;ence; which to this day continues to be the law of England. This rule is unque&s;tion|ably a great ob&s;truction to the cour&s;e of ju|&s;tice. For in&s;tead of trying the cau&s;e, and awarding execution when the claim is found ju&s;t, it has forced the Engli&s;h courts upon a wide circuit of pains and penalties. The refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to the ju&s;tice of a court inve&s;ted with legal authority, is a crime of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t nature, being an act of re|bellion again&s;t the &s;tate. And it is ju&s;tly thought, that the per&s;on who refu&s;es to &s;ubmit to the laws of his country, ought
<PB N="30" REF="29">
not to be under the protection of the&s;e laws. Therefore, this contempt and con|tumacy, in civil actions as well as criminal, &s;ubjects the party to diver&s;e forfeitures and penalties.

<P>IN Scotland, we did not originally try even civil cau&s;es in ab&s;ence, more than the Engli&s;h do at pre&s;ent. The compul&s;ion to force the defendant to appear, was attach|ment of his moveables, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which he was re&s;tored upon finding bail to &s;i&s;t him&s;elf in court. If he remained ob|&s;tinate, and offered not bail, the goods at|tached were delivered to the claimant, who remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, till the proprietor was willing to &s;ubmit to a trial. This is plainly laid down in the ca&s;e of the brieve of right, or declarator of property; where, if the defendant remain contumax, and neither
<PB N="31" REF="30">
appear nor plead an e&s;&s;oin&yogh;ie, the land in controver&s;y is &s;eized and &s;eque&s;tred in the King's hands, there to remain for fifteen days: if the defendant appear within the fifteen days, he recovers the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, upon finding caution to an&s;wer as law will: other|wi&s;e the land is adjudged to the pur&s;uer, after which the defendant has no remedy but by a brieve of right<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reg. Maj. l. 1. cap. 7.</NOTE>. Neither ap|pears there to be any &s;ort of cognition in other civil cau&s;es, &s;uch as actions for pay|ment of debt, for performance of contracts, for moveable goods; where the fir&s;t &s;tep was to arre&s;t the defendant's moveables, till he found caution to an&s;wer as law will<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Quon. attach. cap. 1. cap. 49. &sect; 3.</NOTE>. And in the&s;e ca&s;es, as well as in the brieve of right, the goods attached were, no doubt, delivered to the claimant, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by him while his party re|mained contumacious.</P>
<P>AFTER the Roman law prevailed in this part of the i&s;land, the foregoing practice
<PB N="32" REF="31">
wore out, and, with regard to civil actions, gave place to a more mild and equitable method, which, without &s;ubjecting the de|fendant to any penalty, is more available to the pur&s;uer. This method is to try the cau&s;e in ab&s;ence of the defendant, in the &s;ame manner as was done in Rome, of which mention is made above. The rele|vancy is &s;ettled, proof taken, and judgment given, preci&s;ely as where the defendant is pre&s;ent. The only inconvenience of this method, upon its introduction, was the de|priving the pur&s;uer of the defendant's te&s;ti|mony, when he cho&s;e to refer his libel to the defendant's oath. This was remedied by holding the defendant as confe&s;&s;ed upon the libel. To explain this form, I mu&s;t &s;hortly premi&s;e, that by the old law of this i&s;land, it was reckoned a hard&s;hip too great, to oblige a man to give evidence again&s;t him&s;elf; and for that rea&s;on the pur&s;uer, even in a civil action, was denied the be|nefit of the defendant's te&s;timony. In Scotland, the notions of the Roman law
<PB N="33" REF="32">
prevailing, which, in the particular now mentioned, were more equitable than our old law, it was made a rule, that the defen|dant in a civil action is bound to give evi|dence again&s;t him&s;elf; and if he refu&s;e to give his oath, he is held as confe&s;&s;ing the fact alledged by the pur&s;uer. This practice was at hand to be transferred into a proce&s;s where the defendant appears not; and from this time, the contumacy of the defendant who obeys not a citation in a civil cau&s;e, has been attended with no penal con&s;e|quence; for a good rea&s;on, that the pur&s;uer hath a more effectual method for attaining his end, which is to in&s;i&s;t, that the defen|dant be held as confe&s;t upon the libel. Nor is this a &s;tretch beyond rea&s;on; for the defendant's acquie&s;cence in the claim may ju&s;tly be pre&s;umed, from his refu&s;ing to appear in court.</P>
<P>BUT this new form is defective in one particular ca&s;e. We hold not a party as confe&s;t, unle&s;s he be cited per&s;onally. What
<PB N="34" REF="33">
if one, to avoid a per&s;onal citation, keep out of the way: is there no remedy in this ca&s;e? why not recur to the ancient practice of at|taching his effects, till he find caution to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h regulation, that there can be no trial in ab&s;ence, holds, we may be|lieve, in criminal as well as in civil cau&s;es, not even excepting a pro&s;ecution for high trea&s;on. But as this crime will never be &s;uffered to go unpuni&s;hed, a method has been invented, which, by a circuit, &s;upplies the defect of the common law. If a party accu&s;ed of trea&s;on or felony, contumaci|ou&s;ly keep out of the way, the crime, it is true, cannot be tried: but the per&s;on ac|cu&s;ed may be outlawed for contumacy; and the outlawry, in &s;uch ca&s;es, is made the means to gain the end propo&s;ed by the pro|&s;ecution. For though outlawry, by the common law, hath no other effect, as above ob&s;erved, than a denunciation upon a horn|ing with us; yet the horror of &s;uch offences
<PB N="35" REF="34">
hath introduced a regulation beyond the common law, <HI>viz.</HI> that outlawry in the ca&s;e of felony, &s;ubjects the party to that very puni&s;hment which is inflicted upon a felon convict; and the like in trea&s;on, cor|ruption of blood excepted. There is no oc|ca&s;ion to make any circuit with relation to other crimes. For the puni&s;hment of out|lawry, by the common law, equals the pu|ni&s;hment of any crime, trea&s;on and felony excepted.</P>
<P>HENCE the rea&s;on why death before trial is, in England, a total bar to all forfeitures and penalties, even for high trea&s;on. The crime cannot be tried in ab&s;ence; and after death there can be no contempt for not appearing.</P>
<P>LAWYERS have generally but an unhap|py talent at reformation; for they &s;eldom aim at the root of the evil. In the ca&s;e before us, a &s;uper&s;titious attachment to an|cient forms, hath led Engli&s;h lawyers into a
<PB N="36" REF="35">
glaring ab&s;urdity. To prevent the hazard of inju&s;tice, there mu&s;t not be &s;uch a thing as a trial in ab&s;ence of the per&s;on accu&s;ed. Yet no difficulty is made, to pre&s;ume a man guilty in ab&s;ence without a trial, and to puni&s;h him in the &s;ame manner as if he had been fairly tried and regularly con|demned. This is in truth converting a pri|vilege into a penalty, and holding the ab|&s;ent guilty, without allowing them the be|nefit of a trial. The ab&s;urdity of this me|thod is equally glaring in another in&s;tance. It is not &s;ufficient that the defendant appear in court: it is nece&s;&s;ary that he plead, and put him&s;elf upon a trial by his country. The Engli&s;h adhere &s;trictly to the original notion, that a proce&s;s implies a judicial contract, and that there can be no proce&s;s, unle&s;s the defendant &s;ubmit to have his cau&s;e tried. Upon this account, it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule, that the per&s;on accu&s;ed who &s;tands mute or refu&s;es to plead, cannot be tried. To this ca&s;e a peculiar puni&s;hment is adapted, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of
<PB N="37" REF="36">
<HI>peine fort et dure.</HI> The per&s;on accu&s;ed is pre&s;&s;ed to death. And there are in&s;tances upon record, of per&s;ons &s;ubmitting to this puni&s;hment, in order to &s;ave their land|e&s;tates to their heirs, which, by the law of England, are forfeited on &s;ome ca&s;es of fe|lony, as well as on high trea&s;on. But here again high trea&s;on is an exception. Stand|ing mute in this ca&s;e is attended with the &s;ame forfeiture, which is inflicted on a per|&s;on attainted of high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>WE follow the Engli&s;h law &s;o far as that no crime can be tried in ab&s;ence. Some exceptions to this rule were, it is true, for a time, indulged, which &s;hall be mentioned by and by. But we at pre|&s;ent adhere &s;o &s;trictly to the rule, that a decree in ab&s;ence, obtained by the pro|curator-fi&s;cal before an inferior court for a bloodwit upon full proof, was reduced: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Lords being of opinion, that a decreet in ab&s;ence could not pro|ceed; and that the judge could go no

<P>IT is certainly a defect in our law, that voluntary ab&s;ence &s;hould be a protection again&s;t the puni&s;hment of atrocious crimes. Excepting the crime of high trea&s;on, with regard to which the Engli&s;h regula|tion hath now place with us, the puni&s;h|ment of outlawry, whatever the crime be, never goes farther than &s;ingle and liferent e&s;cheat.</P>
<P>As to the trial of a crime after death, which, by the Roman law, was indulged in the ca&s;e of trea&s;on, there are two rea&s;ons again&s;t it. The fir&s;t and chief is, that whether the crime be committed again&s;t the publick or again&s;t a private per&s;on, re&s;entment, the &s;pring and foundation of puni&s;hment, ought to be buried with the
<PB N="39" REF="38">
criminal; and, in fact, never is indulged by any per&s;on of humanity, after the crimi|nal is no more. The other is drawn from the unequal &s;ituation of the relations of the decea&s;ed, who, unacquainted with his pri|vate hi&s;tory, have not the &s;ame means of ju&s;tification, which to him&s;elf, as it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, would have been an ea&s;y ta&s;k. Upon this account, the indulging criminal pro&s;ecutions after death, would open a door to mo&s;t grievous oppre&s;&s;ion. In a country where &s;uch is the law, no man can be &s;e|cure, that his heirs &s;hall inherit his fortune. With re&s;pect, however, to trea&s;on, it &s;eems rea&s;onable, that in &s;ome &s;ingular ca&s;es it ought to be excepted from this rule. If a man be &s;lain in battle, fighting ob&s;ti|nately again&s;t an e&s;tabli&s;hed government, there is no inhumanity in forfeiting his e|&s;tate after his death: nor can &s;uch a privi|lege in the crown, confined to the ca&s;e now mentioned, be made an engine of oppre&s;|&s;ion, con&s;idering the notoriety of the fact. And indeed it carries no &s;light air of ab&s;ur|dity,
<PB N="40" REF="39">
that the mo&s;t daring acts of rebellion, <HI>viz.</HI> ri&s;ing in arms again&s;t a lawful &s;ove|reign, and oppo&s;ing him in battle, &s;hould, if death en&s;ue, be out of the reach of law: for dying in battle, honourably in the man's own opinion and in that of his a&s;&s;ociates, can in no light be reckoned a puni&s;hment. This in reality is a very great encourage|ment, to per&s;evere in rebellion. A man who takes arms again&s;t his country, where &s;uch is the law, can have no true courage, if he lay them down, till he either conquer or die. This may be thought a rea&s;onable apology for the Roman law, which coun|tenanced a trial of trea&s;on after death, con|fined expre&s;ly to the ca&s;e now mentioned. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Is, qui in reatu decedit, integri &s;tatus decedit.

<P>THE Roman law was copied, indi&s;creetly indeed, by our legi&s;lature, authorizing, with|out any limitation, a proce&s;s for trea&s;on after the death of the per&s;on &s;u&s;pected<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act 69. p. 1540.</NOTE>. But the legi&s;lature, reflecting upon the danger of tru&s;ting with the crown a privilege &s;o extraordinary, did, by an act in the year 1542, which was never printed, re&s;train this privilege within proper bounds. The words are: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And becau&s;e the &s;aids Lords think the &s;aid act (<HI>viz.</HI> the act 1540) too general and prejudicial to all the Ba|rons of this realm; therefore &s;tatutes and ordains, that the &s;aid act &s;hall have no place in time coming, but again&s;t the airs of them that notourly committs, or &s;hall commit crimes of le&s;e maje&s;ty a|gain&s;t the King's per&s;on, again&s;t the

<P>A proce&s;s of trea&s;on again&s;t an ab&s;ent per&s;on regularly cited, re&s;ts upon a different footing. It is &s;ome pre&s;umption of guilt, that a man accu&s;ed of a crime, ob&s;tinately refu&s;es to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the law of his
<PB N="43" REF="42">
country; and yet the dread of inju&s;tice or of fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es, may, with an innocent per&s;on, be a motive to keep out of the way. This uncertainty about the motive of the per&s;on accu&s;ed, ought to confine to the highe&s;t court every trial in ab&s;ence, that of trea&s;on e&s;pecially, where the per&s;on accu&s;ed is not upon an equal footing with his pro&s;e|cutors. And probably this would have been the practice in Scotland, but for one rea&s;on. The &s;e&s;&s;ions of our parliament of old, were generally too &s;hort for a regular trial in a criminal cau&s;e. Upon this account, the trial of trea&s;on after death, was, from nece&s;&s;ity rather than choice, permitted to the court of ju&s;ticiary. And this court which en|joyed the greater privilege, could entertain no doubt of the le&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> that of trying trea&s;on in ab&s;ence. This latter power how|ever being called in que&s;tion, the legi&s;lature thought proper to countenance it by an ex|pre&s;s &s;tatute; not indeed as to every &s;pecies of trea&s;on in general, but only in the ca&s;e of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"trea&s;onable ri&s;ing in arms, and open

and manife&s;t rebellion again&s;t his ma|je&s;ty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 11. p. 1669.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>FROM this deduction it will be manife&s;t, that the act 31. p. 1690, re&s;cinding certain forfeitures in ab&s;ence pronounced by the court of ju&s;ticiary before the &s;aid &s;tatute 1669, proceeds upon a mi&s;take in fact, in &s;ub&s;uming, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That before the year 1669, there was no law impowering the Lords of ju&s;ticiary to forfeit in ab&s;ence for per|duellion."</Q> And yet this mi&s;take is made an argument, not indeed for depriving the court of ju&s;ticiary of this power in time coming, but for annulling all &s;entences for trea&s;on pronounced in ab&s;ence by this court before the 1669. The&s;e &s;entences, it is true, proceeding from undue influence of mini&s;terial power, de&s;erved little counte|nance. But if they were iniquitous, it had been &s;uitable to the dignity of the legi&s;lature, to annul them for that cau&s;e, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;igning a rea&s;on that cannot
<PB N="45" REF="44">
bear a &s;crutiny. However this be, I cannot avoid ob&s;erving, that the juri&s;diction of the court of ju&s;ticiary to try in ab&s;ence open and manife&s;t rebellion, was far from being irrational. And it is remarkable, that this was the opinion of our legi&s;lature, even after the revolution; for though they were will|ing to lay hold of any pretext to annul a number of unju&s;t forfeitures, they did not however find it convenient to abrogate the &s;tatute 1669, but left it in full force. Com|paring our law in this particular with that of England, it appears to me clear, that the form authorized by the &s;aid &s;tatute, which gives acce&s;s to a fair trial, ought to be pre|ferred before the Engli&s;h form, which an|nexes the highe&s;t penalties to an outlawry for trea&s;on, without any trial.</P>
<P>IT remains only to be ob&s;erved, that the Engli&s;h trea&s;on laws, being &s;ince the union made a part of our criminal law, the fore|going regulations, for trying the crime of trea&s;on in ab&s;ence of the party accu&s;ed or
<PB N="46" REF="45">
after his death, are at an end; and at pre|&s;ent, that the rule holds univer&s;ally, that no crime can be tried in ab&s;ence. In England, no crime was ever tried in ab&s;ence, far le&s;s after death. The parliament it&s;elf did not a&s;&s;ume this power; for an attainder for high trea&s;on in ab&s;ence of the delinquent, pro|ceeds not upon trial of the cau&s;e, but is of the nature of an outlawry for contuma|cious ab&s;ence. Nor is this form varied by the union of the two kingdoms; for the Briti&s;h parliament, as to all matters of law, is governed by the forms e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Engli&s;h parliament before the union. At the &s;ame time, the humanity of our pre&s;ent manners, affords great &s;ecurity, that the trea&s;on laws will never be &s;o far extended in Britain as they have been in Scotland, to forfeit an heir for the crime of his ance&s;tor. I am not of opinion, that &s;uch a forfeiture is repugnant to the common rules of ju&s;tice, when it is confined to the ca&s;e above men|tioned; and yet it is undoubtedly more be|neficial for the inhabitants of this i&s;land,

<HEAD>HISTORY OF EXECUTION again&s;t MOVEABLES and LAND for payment of debt.</HEAD>
<P>AGAINST a debtor refractory or negligent, the proper legal remedy is to lay hold of his effects for paying his creditors. This is the method pre&s;cribed by the Roman law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 15. &sect; 2. de re judic,</NOTE>, with the following addition, that the moveables, as of le&s;s importance than the land, &s;hould be fir&s;t &s;old. But the Roman law is defective,
<PB N="50" REF="48">
in one re&s;pect that the creditor was di&s;ap|pointed, if no buyer was found. The de|fect was &s;upplied by a re&s;cript of the Em|peror<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 15. &sect; 3. de re judic.</NOTE>, appointing, that, failing a purcha&s;er, the goods &s;hall be adjudged to the creditor by a rea&s;onable extent.</P>
<P>AMONG other remarkable innovations of the feudal law, one is, that land was with|drawn from commerce, and could not be attached for payment of debt. Neither could the va&s;&s;al be attached per&s;onally, becau&s;e he was bound per&s;onally to the &s;u|perior for &s;ervice. The moveables there|fore, which were always the chief &s;ubject of execution, came now to be the only &s;ub|ject. In England, attachment of move|ables for payment of debt, is warranted by the King's letter directed to the She|riff, commonly called a <HI>Fieri Facias;</HI> and this practice is derived from common law without a &s;tatute. The &s;heriff is com|manded, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to &s;ell as many of the debtor's
<PB N="51" REF="49">
moveables as will &s;atisfy the debt, and to return the money with the writ into the court at We&s;tmin&s;ter."</Q> The method is the &s;ame at this day, without any remedy, in the ca&s;e where a purcha&s;er is not found.</P>
<P>LAND, when left free to commerce by di&s;&s;olution of the feudal fetters, was of cour&s;e &s;ubjected to execution for payment of debt. This was early introduced with relation to the King. For from the <HI>Magna Charta</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cap. 8th.</NOTE>, it appears to have been the King's privilege, failing goods and chattels, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land till the debt was paid. And from the &s;ame chapter it ap|pears, that the like privilege is be&s;towed upon a cautioner, in order to draw pay|ment of what &s;ums he is obliged to ad|vance for the principal debtor. By the &s;ta|tute of merchants<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">13th Edward I.</NOTE>, the &s;ame privilege is given to merchants; and by 13th Edward I. cap. 18. the privilege is communicated to creditors in general; but with the following
<PB N="52" REF="50">
remarkable limitation, that they are allow|ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the half only of the land. By this time it was &s;ettled, that the military va&s;&s;al's power of aliening, reached the half only of his freehold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See abridgement of &s;tatute law, Tit, <HI>Recognition.</HI></NOTE>. And it was thought incongruous, to take from the debtor, by force of execution, what he him&s;elf could not di&s;po&s;e of even for the mo&s;t rational con&s;ideration. The la&s;t mentioned &s;tatute enacts, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That where debt is recovered, or knowledged in the King's court, or da|mages awarded, it &s;hall be in the election of him that &s;ueth, to have a <HI>fieri facias</HI> unto the &s;heriff, to levy the debt upon the lands and chattels of the debtor; or that the &s;heriff &s;hall deliver to him all the chattels of the debtor, (&s;aving his oxen and bea&s;ts of his plough) and the one half of his land, until the debt be levied upon a rea&s;onable extent: and if he be put out of the land, he &s;hall recover it again by writ of nouvel di&s;&s;ei&s;in, and after that by writ of redi&s;&s;ei&s;in if need be."</Q>
<PB N="53" REF="51">
The writ authorized by this &s;tatute, which, from the election given to the creditor, got the name of <HI>Elegit,</HI> is the only writ in the law of England, that in any degree cor|re&s;ponds to our appri&s;ing or adjudication. The operations however of the&s;e two writs are far from being the &s;ame. The property of the land appri&s;ed or adjudged, is trans|ferred to the creditor in &s;atisfaction of his claim, if the debtor forbear to make pay|ment for ten years: but an <HI>elegit</HI> hath no other effect, but to put the creditor in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion till the debt be paid, by levying the rents and profits. This is an inconvenient method of drawing payment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FOR be&s;ides the inconvenience of getting payment by parcels, it is not ea&s;y for the creditor in compting for the rents to avoid a law-&s;uit, which in this ca&s;e mu&s;t always be trouble&s;ome and expen&s;ive. It may al&s;o happen, that the rent does no more but &s;atisfy the intere&s;t of the money; mu&s;t the creditor in this ca&s;e be &s;atisfied with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, with|out ever hoping to acquire the property? The common law a&s;&s;uredly affords him no remedy. But it is probable, that upon application by the creditor, the court of chancery, upon a principle of equity, will direct the land to be &s;old for pay|ment of the debt.</NOTE>: but at the time of the &s;tatute, it was probably thought
<PB N="54" REF="52">
a &s;tretch, to &s;ubject land at any rate to a creditor for his payment. And the Eng|li&s;h, tenacious of their cu&s;toms, never think of making improvements, or even of &s;up|plying legal defects; of which this &s;tatute affords another in&s;tance, &s;till greater than that now mentioned. In England, at pre|&s;ent, land, generally &s;peaking, is ab&s;olute|ly under the power of the proprietor; and yet the ancient practice &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, confin|ing execution to the half, preci&s;ely as in early times, when the debtor could di&s;po&s;e of no more but the half. Means however are contrived, indirect indeed, to &s;upply this palpable defect. Any other creditor is au|thorized to &s;eize the half of the land left out of the fir&s;t execution, and &s;o on with|out end. Thus, by &s;trictly adhering to form without regarding &s;ub&s;tance, law, in|&s;tead of a rational &s;cience, becomes a heap of &s;ubterfuges and incongruities, which tend in&s;en&s;ibly to corrupt the morals of tho&s;e who make law their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="53">
AND here, to prevent mi&s;takes, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the clau&s;e in the &s;tatute, bearing, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the &s;heriff by a <HI>fieri fa|cias</HI> may levy the debt upon the land and chattels of the debtor,"</Q> authori&s;es not the &s;heriff to deliver the land to the creditor, but only to &s;ell what is found up|on the land, &s;uch as corn or cattle, and to levy the rents which at the time of the execution are due by the tenants.</P>
<P>LETTERS of poinding in Scotland, cor|re&s;pond to the writ of <HI>Fieri Facias</HI> in Eng|land: but the defect above mentioned in the <HI>fieri facias,</HI> is &s;upplied in our execution again&s;t moveables according to its ancient form, which is copied from the Roman law. The execution was in the following manner: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The goods upon the debtor's land, whe|ther belonging to the ma&s;ter or tenant, are carried to the market cro&s;s of the head burgh of the &s;heriffdom, and there &s;old for payment of the debt. But if a purcha&s;er be not found, goods are ap|prized
<PB N="56" REF="54">
to the value of the debt, and de|livered to the creditor for his payment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quon. attach. cap. 49.</NOTE>."</Q> And here it mu&s;t be remarked, that bating the rigour of &s;elling the tenant's goods for the landlord's debt, this method is greatly preferable to that pre&s;ently in u&s;e, which enjoins not a &s;ale of the goods, but only that they be delivered to the creditor at apprized values. This is unju&s;t; becau&s;e in place of money, which the creditor is entitled to claim, goods are impo&s;ed on him, to which he has no claim. But this act of inju&s;tice to the creditor, is a triffle compared with the wrong done to the debtor by another branch of the execution that has crept into practice. In letters of poinding, a blank being left for the name of the me&s;&s;enger, the creditor is impowered to chu&s;e what me&s;&s;enger he plea&s;es, and of con&s;equence to chu&s;e al&s;o the appre|tiators; by which means he is in effect both judge and party. In a practice &s;o irre|gular, what can be expected but an unfair
<PB N="57" REF="55">
appretiation, always below the value of the goods poinded? And for gra&s;ping at this undue advantage, the creditor's pretext is but too plau&s;ible, <HI>viz.</HI> that, contrary to the nature of his claim, he is forced, as I have &s;aid, to accept goods in lieu of money. Thus our execution again&s;t moveables in its pre&s;ent form, is irregular and unju&s;t in all views. Wonderful, that contrary to the tendency of all publick regulations towards perfection, this &s;hould have gradually de|clined from good to bad, and from bad to wor&s;e! And we &s;hall have additional cau&s;e to wonder, when, in the cour&s;e of this en|quiry, it appears, that the indulging to the creditor the choice of the me&s;&s;enger and appretiators, has, with re&s;pect to execution again&s;t land, produced effects &s;till more per|nicious than that under con&s;ideration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">POINDING is put upon a better footing by act of &s;e|derunt, 9th Augu&s;t 1754.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OUR Kings, it is probable, borrowed from England the privilege of entering upon
<PB N="58" REF="56">
the debtor's land, for payment of debt. That they had this privilege appears from 2d &s;tatutes Robert I. cap. 9. which is co|pied almo&s;t word for word from the 8th chapter of the <HI>Magna Charta.</HI> Cautioners had the &s;ame privilege<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 10.</NOTE>, which was extend|ed, as in England, to merchants<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 19.</NOTE>. This execution did not entitle the creditor to have the land &s;old for payment of the debt, but only to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land, and to maintain his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till the debt was paid; preci&s;ely as in England. But as it has been the genius of our law, in all ages, to favour creditors, a form of execution again&s;t land for payment of debt, more ef|fectual than that now mentioned, or to this day is known in England, was early intro|duced into this part of the i&s;land, which is to &s;ell land for payment of the debt, in the &s;ame manner that moveables were &s;old. The brieve of di&s;tre&s;s, failing moveables, is extended to the debtor's land, which is ap|pointed to be &s;old by the &s;heriff for payment
<PB N="59" REF="57">
of the debt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stat. Alex. II. cap. 24.</NOTE>. Nor was this execution re|&s;tricted to the half as in England; for our forefathers were more regardful of the cre|ditor than of the &s;uperior. And though this originally might be a &s;tretch, it hap|pens luckily to be perfectly well accommo|dated to the pre&s;ent condition of land-pro|perty, which, for the mo&s;t part, is not more limited than the property of moveables.</P>
<P>BUT here a defect will be ob&s;erved in Alexander's &s;tatute, that no provi&s;ion is made in ca&s;e a purcha&s;er be not found; the le&s;s excu&s;able that the legi&s;lature had before their eyes a perfect model, in the form pre|&s;cribed for the attachment of moveables.</P>
<P>THERE are words in this &s;tatute to occa|&s;ion a doubt, whether attachment of land for payment of debt, was not an earlier practice in our law. The words are: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The debtor not &s;elling his lands within fifteen days, the &s;heriff and the King's &s;ervants
<PB N="60" REF="58">
&s;hall &s;ell the lands and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions pertain|ing to the debtor, <HI>conform to the con&s;uetude of the realm,</HI> until the creditor be &s;atisfied of the principal &s;um, with damage, ex|pence, and intere&s;t."</Q> But the&s;e words, <HI>Conform to the con&s;uetude of the realm,</HI> &s;eem to refer to the form of &s;elling move|ables. For I &s;ee not what other regulation was introduced by the &s;tatute, if it was not &s;elling of land for payment of debt. And con&s;idering the circum&s;tances of the&s;e times, when the feudal law was &s;till in vigour, and the commerce of land but in its infancy, we cannot rationally a&s;&s;ign an earlier date to this practice.</P>
<P>IN England, the &s;tatute of merchants was nece&s;&s;ary to creditors, who at that period had not acce&s;s to the land of their debtors. But as in Scotland every creditor had ac|ce&s;s to the land of his debtor, it will be expected that &s;ome account &s;hould be given, why the &s;tatute of merchants was intro|duced here. What occurs is, that the chief
<PB N="61" REF="59">
view of the Scotch &s;tatute, was to give acce&s;s to the debtor's per&s;on, which formerly could not be attached for payment of debt. And when &s;uch a novelty was introduced, as that of giving execution again&s;t the per&s;on of the debtor, again&s;t his moveables, and again&s;t his land, all at the &s;ame time, it was pro|bably thought &s;ufficient, to give &s;ecurity up|on the land for payment of the debt, with|out proceeding to a &s;ale.</P>
<P>IT appears from our records, that &s;ome|times land was &s;old for payment of debt upon the above mentioned &s;tatute of Alex|ander II. and &s;ometimes that &s;ecurity only was granted upon the land by authority of the &s;tatute of merchants. Of the latter, one in&s;tance occurs upon record, in a &s;ei&s;in dated 29th January 1450; and many &s;uch in&s;tances are upon record down to the time that general appri&s;ings crept into practice.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid above, that the &s;tatute of Alexander II. is defective, in not providing
<PB N="62" REF="60">
a remedy where a purcha&s;er is not found. But this defect was &s;upplied by our judges; and land, failing a purcha&s;er, was adjudged to the creditor by a rea&s;onable extent; which, without a &s;tatute, was done by ana|logy of the execution again&s;t moveables. Of this there is one preci&s;e in&s;tance in a charter, dated 22d July 1450, a copy of which is annexed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N^o. 6th.</NOTE>. And thus we find, that what is properly called a decreet of ap|pri&s;ing, was introduced into practice before the &s;tatute 1469, though that &s;tatute is by all our authors a&s;&s;igned as the origin of ap|pri&s;ings. But it appears from the &s;tatute it&s;elf, compared with former practice, that nothing el&s;e was in view, but to limit the effect of the brieve of di&s;tre&s;s with re&s;pect to tenants, that there &s;hould not be execu|tion again&s;t their goods for the landlord's debt, farther than to the extent of a term's rent. And becau&s;e it was reckoned a hard|&s;hip on a debtor con&s;idered as landlord, to have his land taken from him, neglecting
<PB N="63" REF="61">
the moveable goods upon the land; there|fore a &s;weetning privilege is be&s;towed on him, of redeeming the land within &s;even years. But this regulation was attended with an unhappy con&s;equence, probably not fore&s;een. It rendered ineffectual the mo&s;t u&s;eful branch of the execution, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;elling land for payment of the debt. For no per&s;on will chu&s;e to purcha&s;e land un|der rever&s;ion, while there is any pro&s;pect of coming at land without an embargo. This &s;tatute therefore, in&s;tead of giving a beginning to appri&s;ings of land, did in reality reduce them to a form le&s;s perfect than they had originally.</P>
<P>ONE &s;alutary regulation was introduced by this &s;tatute. By the former practice, no bounds being &s;et to the time of compleating the execution, it was left to the di&s;cretion of the &s;heriff, to delay as long as he plea&s;ed for a purcha&s;er. To &s;upply this defect, it was enacted, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That if a purcha&s;er be not found in &s;ix months, the &s;heriff mu&s;t pro|ceed
<PB N="64" REF="62">
to appri&s;e land, and to adjudge it to the creditor."</Q></P>
<P>IN no particular are the different man|ners of the two nations more con&s;picuous, than in their laws. The Engli&s;h, tenacious of their cu&s;toms, have, from the beginning, pre&s;erved their forms entire with little or no variation. The Scotch, delighting in change, have been always attempting or indulging innovations. By this propen&s;ity, many articles of our law are brought to a rea&s;onable degree of perfection. But by the &s;ame propen&s;ity, we are too apt to in|dulge relaxation of di&s;cipline, which has bred a profu&s;ion of &s;lovenly practice in law|matters. The following hi&s;tory will ju&s;tify the latter part of this reflection.</P>
<P>DURING a vacancy in the office of &s;he|riff, or even when the &s;heriff was otherwi&s;e employed, it appears to have been early the practice of the King's courts, to name a &s;ub&s;titute for executing any particular
<PB N="65" REF="63">
affair; and this &s;ub&s;titute was called <HI>The &s;heriff in that part.</HI> Within thirty years of the &s;tatute 1469, there are examples of let|ters of appri&s;ing, directed to me&s;&s;engers at arms, as <HI>&s;heriffs in that part.</HI> The&s;e letters, we may believe, were at fir&s;t not permitted without a &s;ufficient cau&s;e: but &s;lighter and &s;lighter cau&s;es being &s;u&s;tained, heretable &s;heriffs took the alarm, and obtained an act of parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 82. p. 1540.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"di&s;charging commi&s;|&s;ions to be given in time coming for &s;erv|ing of brieves, or appri&s;ing of lands, but to the judge ordinary, unle&s;s <HI>cau&s;a cognita</HI> upon calling the judge ordinary to object again&s;t the cau&s;e of granting."</Q> But this &s;tatute did not put an end to the abu&s;e. The practice was revived of naming me&s;|&s;engers at arms as &s;heriffs in that part, for executing letters of appri&s;ing, till at the long run it became an e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom, to direct all letters of appri&s;ing to the&s;e officers.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="64">
APPRISING of land, being an execution by the &s;heriff, behoved of con&s;equence to be within the county. But the &s;ub&s;titution, as afore&s;aid, of me&s;&s;engers, who are not connected with any particular county, paved the way to the infringement of a regulation nece&s;&s;arily derived from the very nature of the execution. The fir&s;t in&s;tance on re|cord, of permitting the court of appri&s;ing to be held at Edinburgh, is in the year 1582. The rea&s;on given for a &s;tep &s;o irre|gular was, that the debtor's lands lay in two &s;hires. And as Edinburgh by this time was become the capital of the kingdom, where the King's courts mo&s;t commonly were held, and where every landed gentle|man was &s;uppo&s;ed to have a procurator to an&s;wer for him, it was reckoned no wide &s;tretch, to hold courts of appri&s;ing at Edin|burgh for the whole kingdom. From this period downward, in&s;tances of holding courts of appri&s;ing at Edinburgh, multiply upon us; and this came to be con&s;idered as a matter of right, without nece&s;&s;ity of
<PB N="67" REF="65">
a&s;&s;igning any cau&s;e for demanding a di&s;pen|&s;ation, or at lea&s;t without nece&s;&s;ity of ve|rifying the cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ub&s;titution of a me&s;&s;enger in place of the &s;heriff, produced another effect, not le&s;s irregular than that now mentioned, and much more pernicious to debtors. In let|ters of poinding, as ob&s;erved above, a blank is left for the name of the me&s;&s;enger: the &s;ame is the form of letters of appri&s;ing; and by this means, in both executions equal+ly, the creditor has the choice of the me&s;|&s;enger, and con&s;equently of the appretiators. Thus, by obtaining the court of appri&s;ing to be held at Edinburgh by a judge cho&s;en at will, the creditor acquired the ab&s;olute direction of the execution again&s;t land, and, preci&s;ely as in the execution again&s;t move|ables, became in effect both judge and party. It will not be &s;urpri&s;ing, that the gro&s;&s;e&s;t legal iniquity was the re&s;ult of &s;uch &s;lovenly practice. Creditors taking the advantage of the indulgence given them, exerted their
<PB N="68" REF="66">
power with &s;o little re&s;erve, as to gra&s;p at the debtor's whole land-e&s;tate, without the lea&s;t regard to the extent of the debt. In &s;hort, without u&s;ing &s;o much as the forma|lity of an appretiation, it became cu&s;tomary, to adjudge to the creditor every &s;ubject be|longing to the debtor that could be carried by this execution; for which the expence of bringing witne&s;&s;es to Edinburgh from di&s;tant &s;hires to value land, and the diffi|culty of determining the value of real bur|dens affecting land, were at fir&s;t the pretext.</P>
<P>As there is no record of appri&s;ings before the year 1636, we are not certain of the preci&s;e periods of the&s;e &s;everal innovations. The only knowledge we have of appri&s;ings before that time, is from the King's char|ters pa&s;&s;ing upon appri&s;ings; which is a very lame record, con&s;idering how many ap|pri&s;ings mu&s;t have been led, that were not compleated by charter and &s;ei&s;in. But im|perfect as this record may be, we find &s;e|veral charters in the 1607, 1608, 1613,
<PB N="69" REF="67">
1614, &amp;c. pa&s;&s;ing upon the&s;e general ap|pri&s;ings.</P>
<P>IT cannot but appear &s;trange, that &s;uch gro&s;s relaxation of e&s;&s;ential forms, and &s;uch robbery under colour of law, were not checked in the bud by the &s;overeign court. Yet we find nothing of this kind attempted, though the remedy was at hand. There was no occa&s;ion for any new regulation. It would have been &s;ufficient to re&s;tore the brieve of di&s;tre&s;s to its original principles. All exce&s;&s;es however promote naturally their own cure; which is the mo&s;t remarkable in avarice when exorbitant. The&s;e general appri&s;ings, by their frequency, became a pub|lick nu&s;ance pa&s;t all enduring. The mat|ter was brought under con&s;ideration of par|liament, and a &s;tatute was made, by far too mild. For in&s;tead of cutting down general appri&s;ings root and branch, as illegal and oppre&s;&s;ive, the exorbitant profits were only pruned off; and it was enacted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 6. p. 1621.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That

the rents intromitted with by the credi|tor, if more than &s;ufficient to pay his an|nualrent, &s;hall be applied towards extinc|tion of the principal &s;um."</Q></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t not e&s;cape ob&s;ervation, that by this new regulation, an appri&s;ing is in effect moulded into quite a new form, much le&s;s perfect than it was originally; for from be|ing a judicial &s;ale, it is reduced to the na|ture of a judicial &s;ecurity, or a <HI>pignus praeto|rium,</HI> approaching much nearer than for|merly to the Engli&s;h <HI>elegit.</HI></P>
<P>AN attempt was made by act 19. p. 1672. to re&s;tore &s;pecial adjudications, but un&s;uc|ce&s;sfully. It might have been for&s;een, with|out much penetration, that no debtor will voluntarily give off land &s;ufficient to pay the debt claimed, and a fifth part more, re&s;erving a power of redemption for five years only, when his refu&s;al &s;ubjects him to no harder alternative, than to have his whole lands impledged for &s;ecurity of the neat &s;um
<PB N="71" REF="69">
due, with a power of redemption for ten years. It had been an attempt more worthy of the legi&s;lature, to re&s;tore the brieve of di&s;tre&s;s, by appointing land to be &s;old, up|on application of any &s;ingle creditor, for payment of his debt. But nothing of this kind was thought of, till the year 1681, when a &s;tatute was made, authori&s;ing a &s;ale of the debtor's whole e&s;tate, in ca&s;e of in&s;olvency. This regulation, which was brought to greater perfection by later &s;ta|tutes, is, after all, an imperfect remedy; be|cau&s;e it only takes place where the debtor is bankrupt. And hence it is, that by the pre&s;ent law of Scotland, there is no effectual means for obtaining payment out of the debtor's land-e&s;tate, unle&s;s he be in&s;olvent. Being familiarized with this regulation, it doth not di&s;gu&s;t us; but it probably will &s;urpri&s;e a &s;tranger, to find a country, where the debtor's in&s;olvency affords the only ef|fectual means his creditors have to obtain payment by force of law.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="70">
UPON the whole, it is a curious mor&s;el of hi&s;tory that lies before us. In the fir&s;t &s;tages of our law, we had a form of execution for drawing payment of debt, perfect in its kind, or &s;o nigh perfection, as &s;carce to be &s;u&s;cep|tible of any improvement. It has been the operation of ages, to alter, change, innovate, and relax from this form, till it became grievous and intollerable. New moulded by various regulations, it makes at pre&s;ent a better figure. But with all the improve|ments of later times, the be&s;t that can be &s;aid of it is, that, though far di&s;tant, it approacheth nearer to its original perfection, than at any time for a century or two pa&s;t. And for the publick good, nothing remains for the legi&s;lature, but to review the brieve of di&s;tre&s;s in its original &s;tate, with re&s;pect to moveables as well as land; admitting only &s;ome alterations that are made nece&s;|&s;ary by change of circum&s;tances, &s;uch as the pre&s;ent independency of tenants, and their privilege to hold property di&s;tinct from their landlords.</P>

<HEAD>TRACT XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>HISTORY OF PERSONAL EXECUTION for payment of debt.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubjects that ly open to execution for payment of debt, are, 1&s;t, The debtor's moveables. 2dly, His land. And, 3dly, His per&s;on. The two former being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the tract immediately foregoing, we proceed to the hi&s;tory of the latter. Per&s;onal execution for payment of debt, was introduced after execution again&s;t land, and long after execution again&s;t move|ables. Nor will this appear &s;ingular, when
<PB N="74" REF="72">
we con&s;ider, that the debtor's per&s;on, can|not, like his land or moveables, be convert|ed into money for payment of debt. And with regard to a va&s;&s;al in particular, his per&s;on cannot regularly be withdrawn from the &s;ervice he owes his &s;uperior. This would not have been tolerated while the feudal law was in vigour, and came to be indulged in the decline of that law, when land was improved, and per&s;onal &s;ervices were le&s;s valued than pecuniary ca&s;ualties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">AMONG the ancient Egyptians, payment was taken out of the debtor's goods; but the body of the debtor could not be attached. An individual, upon account of a private debt, could not be withdrawn from the &s;ervice he owed to the publick, whether in peace or war. Our author Diodorus Siculus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book 1. Ch. 6.</NOTE> mentions, that Solon e&s;tabli&s;hed this law in Athens, freeing all the citizens from impri&s;onment for debt. And he adds, that &s;ome did ju&s;tly blame many of the Grecian law-makers, who forbade arms, ploughs, and other things nece&s;|&s;ary for labour, to be taken as pledges, and yet permitted the per&s;ons who u&s;ed the&s;e in&s;truments to be impri&s;oned.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t &s;tatute in this i&s;land introducing per&s;onal execution is, IIth Edward I. which, as appears from the preamble, was to &s;ecure merchants and encourage trade. It is di|rected again&s;t the inhabitants of royal bur|rows,
<PB N="75" REF="73">
and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;ubjects, in the fir&s;t place, their moveables and burgage lands to be &s;old for payment of the debt due to the mer|chant. And failing goods, the body of the debtor is to be taken and kept in pri&s;on till he agree with his creditor. And if he have not wherewith to &s;u|&s;tain him&s;elf in pri&s;on, the creditor &s;hall find him in bread and water."</Q> An ad|ditional &s;ecurity is introduced by 13th Ed|ward I. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If the debtor do not pay the debt at the day, the magi&s;trates, upon application of the creditors, are obliged to commit him to the town-pri&s;on, there to remain upon his own expence until payment. If the debtor be not found within the town, a writ is directed to the &s;heriff of the &s;hire where he is, to impri&s;on him. After a quarter of a year from the time of his impri&s;onment, his goods and lands &s;hall be delivered to the merchant by a rea&s;onable extent, to hold them till the debt is levied, and his body &s;hall remain in pri&s;on, and the merchant
<PB N="76" REF="74">
&s;hall find him bread and water."</Q> This latter &s;tatute was adopted by us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2d &s;tat. Rob. I. cap. 19.</NOTE>; and our &s;tatute, I pre&s;ume, is the foundation of the act of warding peculiar to royal burrows: for this execution is preci&s;ely in terms of the &s;tatute.</P>
<P>As this was found a &s;ucce&s;sful expedient for obtaining payment of debt, it was there|after extended to all creditors<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">25th Edward III. cap. 17.</NOTE>. And thus in England, the creditor may, if he plea&s;es, begin with attaching the per&s;on of his debtor, by a writ named <HI>Capias ad &s;atis|faciendum,</HI> the &s;ame with an act of warding in Scotland again&s;t inhabitants of royal burrows. But as this act of Edward III. was not adopted by our legi&s;lature, there is to this day with us no authority for a <HI>capias ad &s;atisfaciendum,</HI> except in the &s;ingle ca&s;e above mentioned of an act of warding.</P>
<P>IT is a celebrated que&s;tion in the Roman law, touching obligations <HI>ad facta prae&s;tanda,</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="75">
whether the debtor be bound &s;pecifically to perform, or whether he be liable <HI>pro inter|e&s;&s;e</HI> only. It is at lea&s;t the more plau&s;ible opinion, that a man is bound according to his engagement; and after all, why indulge to the debtor an option to pay a &s;um, in place of performing that work to which he bound him&s;elf without an option? The per&s;on accordingly who becomes bound <HI>ad factum prae&s;tandum,</HI> is not with us in|dulged in an alternative. If he refu&s;e when he is able to perform, it is under&s;tood an act of contumacy and di&s;obedience to the law. This is a &s;olid foundation for the letters of four forms, which formerly were i&s;&s;ued upon obligations <HI>ad facta prae&s;tanda.</HI> And this execution was at the &s;ame time abundantly moderate: for it is worthy to be remarked, that there is not in the&s;e let|ters a &s;ingle injunction but what is in the obligor's power to perform. The ulti|mate injunction is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To perform his obli|gation, or to &s;urrender his per&s;on to ward, under the penalty, that otherwi&s;e

he &s;hall be denounced rebel."</Q> If the obligor &s;urrendered his per&s;on to pri&s;on, the will of the letters was fulfilled, and no fur|ther execution did proceed. If he was con|tumacious, by refu&s;ing both alternatives, his di&s;obedience to the law was ju&s;tly held an act of rebellion, to &s;ubject him to be denounced or declared rebel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See in the Appendix, N^o. 7. a copy of letters of four forms.</NOTE>. And per|haps this execution was rather too mild; for the man who refu&s;eth to perform his engagement, when it is in his power, may in great ju&s;tice be declared a rebel, without admitting any alternative, &s;uch as delivering his per&s;on to ward.</P>
<P>OBLIGATIONS for payment of money, were viewed in a different light. If a man failed to pay his debt, the failure was pre|&s;umed to proceed from inability, not ob|&s;tinacy. Therefore, unle&s;s &s;ome criminal circum&s;tance was qualified, the debtor was not &s;ubjected to any &s;ort of puni&s;hment.
<PB N="79" REF="79">
His land and moveables lay open to be at|tached by poinding, appri&s;ing, and arre&s;t|ment, and the&s;e were in this ca&s;e the only remedies provided to the creditor. The Engli&s;h have adopted very different max|ims. Impri&s;onment upon failure of pay|ment, whether con&s;idered as a puni&s;hment or a compul&s;ion, mu&s;t proceed upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of contumacy and unwilling|ne&s;s to pay. For upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of inability, without any fault on the debtor's part, it is not only repugnant to the plaine&s;t principles of law, to puni&s;h him with lo&s;s of liberty, but an ab&s;urd regulation, tend|ing to no good end. Therefore the <HI>capias ad &s;atisfaciendum</HI> in England, mu&s;t be found|ed upon the pre&s;umption of unwillingne&s;s to pay. This appeared to us a har&s;h pre&s;ump|tion, as it is frequently wide of the real fact; and therefore we forbore to adopt the Engli&s;h &s;tatute. But experience taught our legi&s;lature, that failure in making pay|ment proceeds from ob&s;tinacy or idlene&s;s, as often as from inability: nay, in many
<PB N="80" REF="80">
in&s;tances, debtors were found &s;ecreting their effects, in order to di&s;appoint their credi|tors; and there was encouragement to deal in &s;uch fraudulent practices, when debtors were in all events &s;ecure again&s;t per&s;onal execution. The&s;e con&s;iderations produced the act of &s;ederunt 1582. It is &s;et forth in the preamble, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the defect of per|&s;onal execution upon liquid grounds of debt was heavily complained of; becau&s;e, after great charge and tedious delay in obtaining decreet, the creditors were often di&s;appointed of their payment, by &s;imulate and fraudulent alienations made by the debtors, of their lands and goods, whereby execution upon &s;uch decreets was altogether fru&s;trated:"</Q> therefore ap|pointed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That letters of horning, as well as of poinding, &s;hall be directed upon decreets for liquid &s;ums, in the &s;ame man|ner as formerly given upon decreets <HI>ad facta prae&s;tanda.</HI>"</Q> And this act of &s;e|derunt is ratified by the act 139. p. 1584.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="81">
THERE is not in the law of any coun|try a &s;tronger in&s;tance of har&s;hne&s;s, I may &s;ay of brutality, than occurs in our pre|&s;ent form of per&s;onal execution for pay|ment of debt; where the debtor, without ceremony, is declared a rebel, merely upon failure of payment. To puni&s;h a man as a rebel, who, by misfortunes, or be it bad oeconomy, is rendered in&s;olvent, beto|kens the mo&s;t &s;avage and barbarous man|ners. One would imagine love of riches to be the ruling pa&s;&s;ion, in a country where poverty is the object of &s;o great puni&s;hment. It is true, the cruelty of this execution is &s;oftened by practice, as it could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand its ground again&s;t every principle of humanity. It is a &s;ubject however of cu|rio&s;ity, to enquire how this rigorous exe|cution crept in. The act 1584, ju&s;t now mentioned, gives no countenance to it: for the letters of four forms to be i&s;&s;ued by that &s;tatute upon decrees for payment of debt, are by no means &s;o rigorous as our hornings are at pre&s;ent. The&s;e letters, as
<PB N="82" REF="82">
above explained, impo&s;e no other hard&s;hip upon the debtor, than to oblige him to &s;ur|render his per&s;on in ward if he doth not pay. This indeed is a &s;tretch, but a mode|rate one, which the uncertainty whether failure of payment proceeds from unwilling|ne&s;s or inability, may ju&s;tify. But upon &s;uch an uncertainty, to declare a debtor rebel, unle&s;s he pays, is a brutal practice, which can admit of no excu&s;e. If indeed the debtor who does not pay, refu&s;e to put him&s;elf in pri&s;on, this is a contempt of authority, for which he may be ju&s;tly de|clared rebel. The que&s;tion then is, what it was that produced an alteration &s;o rigo|rous in the form of this execution, that a debtor, in place of being denounced rebel upon failing to go to pri&s;on, is denounced rebel upon failing to make payment, when it is often not in his power to make payment?</P>
<P>IN handling this curious &s;ubject, we mu&s;t be &s;atisfied to grope our way in the dark paths of antiquity, almo&s;t without a guide.
<PB N="83" REF="83">
And when we travel this road, the fir&s;t thing we di&s;cover is, that letters of four forms were not the only warrant for per|&s;onal execution upon <HI>facta prae&s;tanda.</HI> By the act 84. p. 1572, touching the de&s;igna|tion of a man&s;e and glebe to the mini&s;ter, letters of horning are ordered to be directed by the privy council, to charge the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or to remove within ten days, under the pain of rebellion, without any alternative, &s;uch as that of &s;urrendering his per&s;on in ward. And indeed this alternative would be ab&s;urd, where a fact is commanded to be done that cannot conveniently admit of delay. Obligations <HI>ad facta prae&s;tanda</HI> ari&s;ing <HI>ex delicto,</HI> were, I pre&s;ume, attended with the like &s;ummary execution. And I have &s;een one in&s;tance of this, <HI>viz.</HI> letters of horning, <HI>anno</HI> 1573, again&s;t a per&s;on who had been guilty of a &s;puil&yogh;ie, com|manding, that he &s;hould be charged to re|deliver the &s;puil&yogh;ied goods within eight days, under the penalty or certification of being denounced rebel. Thus, though no
<PB N="84" REF="84">
execution was awarded upon civil contracts <HI>ad facta prae&s;tanda</HI> other than letters of four forms, yet, I pre&s;ume, that upon &s;uch obli|gations ari&s;ing <HI>ex delicto,</HI> horning, properly &s;o called, upon one charge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LETTERS of horning mean a letter from the King, or|dering or commanding the debtor to make payment, under the pain of being proclaimed a rebel. The &s;ervice of this letter upon the debtor, is named a Charge of Horning. If the debtor di&s;obey the charge, he is denounced or proclaim|ed a rebel: and becau&s;e of old, a horn &s;erved the &s;ame pur|po&s;e in proclamations that trumpets do at pre&s;ent, therefore the &s;aid letter has by cu&s;tom, though improperly, obtained the name of Letters of Horning, and the &s;ervice of the let|ter has obtained the name of a Charge of Horning.</NOTE>, was common|ly the execution. And as to obligations introduced by &s;tatute, the manner of exe|cution is generally directed in the &s;tatute it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have made another di&s;covery, that the alternative of &s;urrendering the per&s;on in ward, was not always the &s;tile of letters of four forms. On the contrary, when letters of four forms proceeded upon a delict, as they &s;ometimes did, I conjecture, that the foregoing alternative was left out. My
<PB N="85" REF="85">
authority is, the act 53. p. 1572, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"order|ing letters to be direct by the Lords of council in all the four forms, charging excommunicated per&s;ons to &s;atisfy the kirk, under the pain of rebellion,"</Q> with out any &s;uch alternative as &s;urrendering the per&s;on in ward.</P>
<P>THOUGH horning be a generic term, comprehending letters of four forms, as well as horning properly &s;o called, as is clear from the above mentioned &s;tatute 1584, appoint|ing a decree for a liquid &s;um to be made effec|tual by letters of four forms which there pa&s;s under the general name of horning, yet, ge|nerally &s;peaking, when horning is mention|ed in our old &s;tatutes, it is under&s;tood to be horning upon one charge, in oppo&s;ition to letters of four forms. And it is a rule without exception, that wherever horning is ordained to proceed upon a &s;ingle charge, the alternative of &s;urrendering the per&s;on in ward, is under&s;tood to be excluded. For where the common number of charges is
<PB N="86" REF="86">
remitted in order to force a &s;peedy perfor|mance, it would be ab&s;urd to put it in the power of the per&s;on charged, to evade per|formance by going to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>THE operations of our law were origi|nally &s;low and tedious. There behoved to be four citations before a man could be effectually brought into court, and there behoved to be four charges before a man could be effectually brought to give obedi|ence to a decree pronounced again&s;t him. The inconveniency was not much felt in the days of idlene&s;s; but when indu&s;try prevailed, and the value of labour was un|der&s;tood, the multiplicity of the&s;e legal &s;teps became intolerable. The number of citations were reduced to two, authorized by the &s;ame warrant, and at la&s;t a &s;ingle citation was made &s;ufficient. It is probable, that the charges nece&s;&s;ary to be given upon decrees, did originally proceed upon four di&s;tinct letters or warrants, which being found unnece&s;&s;ary, and that one letter or
<PB N="87" REF="87">
warrant might be a &s;ufficient authority for the four charges, the form was changed according to the model of the letters of four forms late&s;t in u&s;e. At the &s;ame time, where di&s;patch was required, as upon obli|gations <HI>ad facta prae&s;tanda</HI> ari&s;ing <HI>ex delicto,</HI> and upon &s;tatutory obligations, one charge in&s;tead of four was made &s;ufficient. But the&s;e different forms of execution were con|fined to obligations <HI>ad facta prae&s;tanda.</HI> And with relation to all of them, not excepting the mo&s;t rigorous, it mu&s;t be remarked, that they did not exceed rational bounds. The obligor was in no ca&s;e declared a re|bel, unle&s;s where he was guilty of a real contempt of legal authority, by refu&s;ing to do &s;ome act which he had power to per|form.</P>
<P>WE next proceed to unfold the origin of per&s;onal execution upon bonded debts, which probably will give light to the pre|&s;ent enquiry. There is no ground to &s;up|po&s;e, that per&s;onal execution was known in
<PB N="88" REF="88">
this i&s;land before the reign of Edward I. In England it was introduced by two &s;ta|tutes, which were adopted by us. This has already been mentioned; as al&s;o that in England, by a &s;tatute of Edward III. every per&s;on who is debtor in a &s;um of money is &s;ubjected to per&s;onal execution; which was not adopted by us. Now, though our law gave no authority for per|&s;onal execution, except again&s;t inhabitants of royal burrows, yet a hint was taken to make this execution more general by con|&s;ent. While money was a &s;carce commo|dity, and while the demand for it was greater than could be readily &s;upplied, monied men, taking advantage of that cir|cum&s;tance, introduced a practice of impo&s;|ing upon borrowers hard conditions, which were ingro&s;&s;ed in the in&s;trument of debt. One of the&s;e was, that in ca&s;e of failing to make payment, per&s;onal as well as real exe|cution &s;hould i&s;&s;ue, And letters of four forms were accordingly i&s;&s;ued: though it may be a doubt, whether, in &s;trict law, a
<PB N="89" REF="89">
private paction be a &s;ufficient foundation for &s;uch execution, which being of the na|ture of a puni&s;hment, cannot ju&s;tly be in|flicted where there is no crime. But by this time we had begun to reli&s;h the Eng|li&s;h notion, that the failing to make pay|ment proceeds generally from unwilling|ne&s;s, and not from inability: and upon that &s;uppo&s;ition the execution was materially ju&s;t, though &s;carce well founded on law. This practice however gained ground, with|out attention to &s;trict principles; and it came to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, that con&s;ent is a &s;ufficient foundation for per&s;onal execution.</P>
<P>BUT the rigour of money-lenders did not &s;top here. They were not &s;atisfied with letters of four forms, becau&s;e the dreadful commination of being declared rebel, might in all events be evaded by the debtor's &s;ur|rendering his per&s;on in ward. Nothing le&s;s would &s;uffice, than to have the mo&s;t rigorous execution at command, &s;uch as was in practice upon an obligation <HI>ad factum</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="90">
<HI>prae&s;tandum,</HI> ari&s;ing <HI>ex delicto.</HI> And thus in bonds for borrowed money, it became cu&s;to|mary to provide, that, in&s;tead of letters of four forms, letters of horning &s;hould proceed upon a &s;ingle charge, commanding the debtor to make payment, under the penalty of being declared a rebel, without admitting the al|ternative of going to pri&s;on. At the &s;ame time, the debtor commonly was charged to make payment within &s;o few days, as not even to have &s;ufficient time for the per|formance, however willing or ready he might be. The rigour of the&s;e pactions was in part repre&s;&s;ed by the act 140. p. 1592; particularly with re&s;pect to the time of performance: but per&s;onal execu|tion upon obligations for debt was left un|touched, as was al&s;o the form of this exe|cution upon a &s;ingle charge, attended with the penalty of rebellion upon failing to make payment.</P>
<P>IN this manner crept in per&s;onal execu|tion upon bonded debts, which in practice
<PB N="91" REF="91">
was &s;o thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed, as to be i&s;&s;ued without ceremony upon con&s;enting in general, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that executorials might pro|ceed in form as effeirs."</Q> One in&s;tance of this appears in the record, <HI>viz.</HI> letters of four forms, John Law&s;on <HI>contra</HI> Sir John Stewart and his &s;on, dated the 7th May 1582, and recorded 16th Augu&s;t thereafter. But probably letters of horning, properly &s;o called, upon a &s;ingle charge, were never i&s;&s;ued unle&s;s in pur&s;uance of an explicite con&s;ent.</P>
<P>IT may ju&s;tly be pre&s;umed, that the practice of per&s;onal execution upon bonded debts paved the way to the above mention|ed act of &s;ederunt 1582. For after per|&s;onal execution upon decrees of con&s;ent for payment of money was once e&s;tabli&s;hed, it was a natural exten&s;ion to give the &s;ame execution upon decrees for payment of money obtained <HI>in foro contentio&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>IT only remains to be ob&s;erved, with re|&s;pect to per&s;onal execution upon decrees <HI>in</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="92">
<HI>foro contentio&s;o,</HI> that it has always been under|&s;tood an extraordinary remedy; and there|fore that it requires the &s;pecial interpo&s;ition of the &s;overeign authority. This authority is obtained by an order directed to the keeper of the King's &s;ignet, i&s;&s;uing from any of his proper courts, &s;uch as the &s;e&s;&s;ion, ju&s;ticiary, or privy council, when it was in being; for the King interpo&s;es his authority of cour&s;e, for executing the ordinances of his own courts. But as he conde&s;cends not to exe|cute the ordinances of any other court, therefore no inferior judge or magi&s;trate can give warrant for letters of horning, not even the judge of the court of admiralty, nor the commi&s;&s;aries of Edinburgh, neither of which properly are the King's courts. The method formerly in u&s;e for procuring per&s;onal execution upon the decrees of &s;uch courts, was to obtain from the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion a decree of interpo&s;ition, common|ly called a <HI>Decreet conform,</HI> which being a decree of a &s;overeign court, was a proper foundation for letters of horning. But this
<PB N="93" REF="93">
method gave place to one more expeditious, as we &s;hall &s;ee anon.</P>
<P>IF this &s;ketch of the origin of per&s;o|nal execution with re&s;pect to debt, be but roughly drawn, let the deficiency of mate|rials plead my excu&s;e. Luckily there is not the &s;ame ground of complaint in the fol|lowing part of the hi&s;tory, every article of which is clearly vouched. The fir&s;t &s;tatute abridging letters of four forms upon decrees <HI>in foro contentio&s;o,</HI> is the act 181. p. 1593, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"authori&s;ing letters of horning containing a &s;ingle charge of ten days, to proceed upon decreets of magi&s;trates withinburgh, without the nece&s;&s;ity of letters conform."</Q> Letters of horning, properly &s;o called, upon a &s;ingle charge being here introduced in place of letters of four forms, the known tenor of &s;uch letters removed all ambiguity, and made it evident, that the legi&s;lature intended, the debtor &s;hould be denoun|ced rebel upon failing to make payment, without admitting the alternative of &s;ur|rendering
<PB N="94" REF="94">
his per&s;on in ward. Here is a mon&s;ter of a &s;tatute, repugnant to huma|nity and common ju&s;tice. But by this time, the alternative of being denounced rebel upon failing to make payment, found|ed on con&s;ent, was familiar; and if &s;uch execution could be founded on con&s;ent, it was reckoned, as would appear, no wide &s;tretch to give the &s;ame execution upon a decree <HI>in foro contentio&s;o.</HI> This however is no &s;ufficient apology for extending a har&s;h practice, which ought rather to have been totally aboli&s;hed. But the influence of cu&s;tom is great; and our legi&s;lature &s;ub|mitted to its authority without due delibe|ration; not only in this &s;tatute, but in o|thers, which pa&s;t afterwards of cour&s;e, ex|tending this regulation to the decrees of other inferior courts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 10. p. 1606. Act 6. p. 1607. Act 15. p. 1609. Act 7. p. 1612.</NOTE>. It may ju&s;tly be a matter of &s;urpri&s;e, how it is po&s;&s;ible, that &s;tatutes &s;o contradictory to every principle of equity and humanity, could make their
<PB N="95" REF="95">
way and be tamely &s;ubmitted to. To ac|count for this, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame thing happened here that con&s;tantly happens with relation to har&s;h and rigorous laws. Such laws have a natural tendency to di&s;&s;o|lution; and even where they are &s;upported by the authority of a &s;ettled government, means are never wanting in practice to blunt their edge. Thus, though the law was &s;ubmitted to, which annexed the pe|nalties of rebellion to the guilt of pre&s;um|ed di&s;obedience, when po&s;&s;ibly at bottom there was no fault, yet no judge could be &s;o devoid of common humanity, as willingly to give &s;cope to &s;uch penalties. A di&s;tinction was &s;oon recognized betwixt trea&s;on or rebellion, in the proper &s;en&s;e of the word, and the con&s;tructive rebellion under con&s;ideration, termed civil rebellion; and it came to be reckoned oppre&s;&s;ive and di&s;graceful, to lay hold of any of the penal|ties attending the latter. In this manner civil rebellion lo&s;t its &s;ting, fir&s;t in prac|tice, and now with regard to &s;ingle and
<PB N="96" REF="96">
liferent e&s;cheat, by a Briti&s;h &s;tatute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">20th Geo. II. 50.</NOTE>. For though the law was &s;carce ever put in exe|cution to make the&s;e penalties effectual, yet as upon &s;ome occa&s;ions they were u&s;ed as a handle for oppre&s;&s;ion, it was thought proper to aboli&s;h them altogether.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, letters of four forms continued to be the only warrant for per|&s;onal execution, upon decrees of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. But this court, e&s;teeming it a &s;ort of impeachment upon their dignity, to be wor&s;e appointed than inferior courts are with re&s;pect to per&s;onal execution, took upon them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act of &s;ederunt 1613.</NOTE> to aboli&s;h letters of four forms, and to appoint the &s;ame letters of horning to pa&s;s upon their own decrees, that by &s;tatute were authorized to pa&s;s upon de|crees of inferior courts. That decrees of the &s;upreme court &s;hould at lea&s;t be equally privileged with tho&s;e of inferior courts, is a propo&s;ition that admits not a di&s;pute. I cannot however, without indignation,
<PB N="97" REF="97">
reflect upon the preamble of the act of &s;ede|runt, a&s;&s;erting, that letters of horning, pro|perly &s;o called, are a form of execution le&s;s burden&s;ome upon debtors than letters of four forms; which is a bold attempt to impo&s;e upon the common &s;en&s;e of mankind.</P>
<P>To compleat this &s;hort hi&s;tory, there only remains to be added in point of fact, that to obtain a warrant for per&s;onal exe|cution, it is &s;carce ever nece&s;&s;ary, as our law now &s;tands, to apply to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion for a decree of interpo&s;ition. By the regulations 1563, concerning the com|mi&s;&s;ary court, a more curt method was in|troduced, for obtaining letters of horning upon the precepts of the commi&s;&s;aries of Edinburgh; which is, that the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion, upon an application to them by peti|tion, &s;hould in&s;tantly i&s;&s;ue a warrant for letters of horning. And the &s;ame method was pre&s;cribed in all the &s;tatutes above men|tioned, that authorized letters of horning upon decrees of inferior courts.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="98">
WHEN we compare our form of per&s;onal execution with that of England, we per|ceive a wide difference. In England, the <HI>capias ad &s;atisfaciendum</HI> is a writ directed to the &s;heriff, to impri&s;on the per&s;on of the debtor, until he give &s;atisfaction to his cre|ditor; of which the con&s;equence is, that payment made by the debtor intitles him of cour&s;e to his liberty. But in Scotland, an act of warding excepted, a debtor is not committed to pri&s;on upon account merely of his failing to make payment. He mu&s;t be denounced rebel before a <HI>capias</HI> or cap|tion can be i&s;&s;ued. At the &s;ame time, this <HI>capias</HI> is not <HI>ad &s;atisfaciendum:</HI> it is built upon a different foundation.

<HEAD>TRACT XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>HISTORY OF EXECUTION for obtaining payment after the death of the debtor.</HEAD>
<P>IN handling this &s;ubject, I cannot hope fully to gratify the reader's curio&s;ity otherwi&s;e than by traceing the hi&s;tory of this branch of law from remote ages. It will be nece&s;&s;ary not only to gather what light we can from the rules of common ju&s;tice, but al&s;o to examine the laws of Eng|land and of old Rome, which have been copied by us in different periods.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="101">
THE great utility of money, as a com|mercial &s;tandard, made it from the time of its introduction a de&s;irable object. It came it&s;elf to be one of the principal &s;ubjects of commerce, and of contracts of loan. When money is lent, it is the duty of the debtor to pay the &s;um at the term covenanted; and to procure money by a &s;ale of his goods, if he cannot otherwi&s;e &s;atisfy his creditor. If the debtor be refractory or negligent, it is the duty of the judge to interpo&s;e, and to direct a &s;ale of the goods, in order that the creditor may draw his payment out of the price.</P>
<P>IN what manner debts are to be made effectual after the debtor's death, by the rules of common ju&s;tice, is a &s;peculation more involved. One thing is obvious, that if no per&s;on claim the property of the goods as heir, or by other legal title, the creditors ought to have the &s;ame remedy that they had during their debtor's life. In this ca&s;e there is required no &s;tretch of
<PB N="103" REF="102">
authority. On the contrary, when a debtor's goods after his death are &s;old for payment of his debts, the law is no further exerted than to &s;upply the defect of will, which, it is pre&s;umed, the debtor would have inter|po&s;ed had he been alive; whereas when a debtor's goods are &s;old during his life, by publick authority, his property is wre&s;ted from him again&s;t his will.</P>
<P>BUT now an heir makes his appearance, and the property is transferred to him by right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Ju&s;tice will not allow him to enjoy the heritage of his ance&s;tor, without acknowledging his ance&s;tor's debts. Therefore, if he &s;ubmit not to pay the whole debts, one of two things mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily follow, either that he account to the creditors for the value of the heritage, or that he con&s;ent to a &s;ale for their behoof. Ju&s;tice, as appears to me, cannot be fulfil|led but by pur&s;uing the latter method; and my rea&s;ons for thinking &s;o are two. The fir&s;t is, that by natural ju&s;tice creditors
<PB N="104" REF="103">
have acce&s;s to the effects only of their debtor, and have no claim again&s;t his i&s;&s;ue or other relations; and therefore that the&s;e effects ought to be &s;urrendered to the credi|tors for their payment, unle&s;s the heir, by making full payment, put an end to the claim which the creditors have to the&s;e effects. The next is, that &s;ale, which is the only unexceptionable method for deter|mining the value of a commercial &s;ubject, ought for that rea&s;on to be preferred by judges, before the more uncertain opinion of witne&s;&s;es. For the <HI>praetium affectionis</HI> of the heir, &s;uppo&s;ing the thing, ought not to weigh again&s;t the more &s;olid intere&s;t of creditors, who are <HI>certantcs de damno evi|tando;</HI> not to mention that an heir, who hath an affection for the &s;ubject, may gra|tify his affection, by offering the &s;malle&s;t &s;um above what another e&s;teems the in|trin&s;ick value.</P>
<P>THE Romans, with re&s;pect to heirs, had a peculiar way of thinking, which mu&s;t be
<PB N="105" REF="104">
explained, becau&s;e it relates to the &s;ubject under con&s;ideration. An heir, in the com|mon &s;en&s;e of mankind, is that per&s;on, who, by blood or by will, is entitled to the ef|fects of a per&s;on decea&s;ed; and the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of an heir is a method e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by law, for ve&s;ting in a living per&s;on effects which belonged to another at his death. Hence it is, that, with re&s;pect to different &s;ubjects, the &s;ame per&s;on may have different heirs; as for example, an heir of blood may &s;ucceed to &s;ome &s;ubjects, and an heir by will to others. The idea of an heir, in the Roman law, is not derived from the right of &s;ucceeding to the heri|tage in general, or to any particular &s;ub|ject, but re&s;ts upon a very different founda|tion. The Roman people were di&s;tingui&s;hed into tribes or <HI>gentes.</HI> A tribe was compo&s;ed of different <HI>familiae,</HI> and a <HI>familia</HI> of different <HI>&s;tirpes;</HI> and while the republick &s;tood, it was one great branch of their police, to pre&s;erve names and families di&s;tinct from each other. To perpetuate old families,
<PB N="106" REF="105">
the privilege of adoption was be&s;towed up|on tho&s;e who had not children. The per|&s;on adopted, who a&s;&s;umed the name of the family, came in place of a natural &s;on, and had all the privileges that by law belong to a natural &s;on. This branch of the Roman police produced a &s;ingular conception of an heir, <HI>viz.</HI> the bearing the name of the fa|mily, and continuing the chain of the fa|mily in place of the per&s;on decea&s;ed. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of an heir among the Romans had no relation to property, was not con&s;i|dered as a right of &s;ucceeding to &s;ubjects, but as a right of &s;ucceeding to the per&s;on decea&s;ed, of coming in his place, of repre|&s;enting him, and of being, as termed in the Roman law, <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum defuncto.</HI> In a word, an heir, in the Roman law, is he who repre&s;ents the decea&s;ed per&s;onally; and the repre&s;enting the decea&s;ed with re&s;pect to &s;ubjects of property, doth not le&s;s or more enter into the Roman definition of an heir. Nor was it at all nece&s;&s;ary that this circum&s;tance &s;hould enter the definition: it
<PB N="107" REF="106">
was &s;ufficient that every benefit of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion was the unavoidable con&s;equence of per&s;onal repre&s;entation; which obviou&s;ly is the ca&s;e. If an heir is <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum defuncto,</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in the eye of law, makes no change of per&s;on, and con&s;equent|ly not even a change of property. Hence the maxim in the Roman law, that <HI>Nemo pote&s;t mori pro parte te&s;tatus et pro parte in|te&s;tatus.</HI> For if an heir was adopted or named, his per&s;onal repre&s;entation of the te&s;tator entitled him of cour&s;e to every &s;ub|ject, and every privilege that belonged to the te&s;tator.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ingular notion of an heir, among the Romans, gave creditors a benefit which they have not by common ju&s;tice. The death of their debtor, if he was repre&s;ented by an heir, made no alteration in their af|fairs. A debtor who had a repre&s;entative, died not in a legal &s;en&s;e; his exi&s;tence was continued in his heir, without change of per&s;on. The heir accordingly was &s;ubjected
<PB N="108" REF="107">
to all the debts, whether he had or had not any benefit by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and if the heir proved dilatory or refractory, his whole effects might be &s;old for payment, as well what belonged properly to him&s;elf, as what he acquired by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This undoubted|ly was a &s;tretch beyond the rules of com|mon ju&s;tice; for creditors ought not to gain by the death of their debtor, and an heir ought not to &s;uffer by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But to palliate this inju&s;tice, an heir had a year to deliberate whether he &s;hould accept of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and if he made it his choice to accept, and to run all hazards, which &s;ometimes produced lo&s;s in&s;tead of gain, this, being his own choice, was reckoned no &s;uch hard&s;hip as to de&s;erve a remedy. But this notion of an heir, beneficial to the cre|ditors in one re&s;pect, was hurtful to them in another. For where the heir's proper debts exceeded his own funds, his creditors had acce&s;s to the funds of the ance&s;tor, which were now become their debtor's pro|perty by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Here was real inju&s;tice
<PB N="109" REF="108">
done to the ance&s;tor's creditors; which in cour&s;e of time was remedied by the Praetor. He decreed a <HI>&s;eparatio bonorum,</HI> and autho|rized the ance&s;tor's funds to be &s;old for payment of his debts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 1. &sect; 1. de &s;eparationibus.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE gro&s;s inju&s;tice of &s;ubjecting an heir to the debts of the ance&s;tor without limi|tation, produced in time another remedy, <HI>viz.</HI> the benefit of inventory, by which, upon making an exact li&s;t of the ance&s;tor's effects, an exception in equity was given to the heir, to protect him from being further liable per&s;onally than to the value of the goods contained in the li&s;t. Whether this value was to be a&s;certained by the opinion of witne&s;&s;es, or whether the heir was bound to &s;ell the goods for payment of the an|ce&s;tor's debts, is not clear. But the latter &s;eems to have been the rule, as may be ga|thered, not only from the rea&s;on of the thing, but from the con&s;titution of Ju&s;ti|nian introducing this remedy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 22. &sect; 4 &amp; 8. C. de jure delib.</NOTE>. And in
<PB N="110" REF="109">
our practice, though an heir who has the benefit of inventory, is not liable per&s;onally beyond the value of the goods in the in|ventory, to be a&s;certained by a proof, yet if the creditors chu&s;e to take them&s;elves to the goods for their payment, it is in their power to bring the &s;ame to &s;ale, and to lay hold of the price for their payment.</P>
<P>BUT however far the Roman law &s;trayed from the common rules of ju&s;tice, where the debtor's heritage was claimed by an heir, the &s;ame complaint does not ly in the ca&s;e of in&s;olvency, where the heir aban|doned the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; for the debtor's goods were in this ca&s;e &s;old for payment of his debts, in the &s;ame manner as when he was alive. It is true, that among the Romans, remarkable originally for virtue and tem|perance, it was ignominious for a citizen to have his effects &s;old by publick authority. To prevent &s;uch di&s;grace, it was common to in&s;titute a &s;lave as heir, who, after the te&s;tator's death, being obliged to enter, the
<PB N="111" REF="110">
hereditary &s;ubjects were &s;old as his property, and the real debtor's name was not men|tioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In&s;tit. de hered. qualit. et diff. &sect; 1. Heineccius antiquit. L. 2. Tit. 17, 18, 19. &sect; 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE proceed to the Engli&s;h law, which in all probability was antiently the &s;ame with our own. And to under&s;tand the &s;pirit of that law, it mu&s;t be premi&s;ed, that while the feudal law was in its pu|rity, a va&s;&s;al had no land-property: he had only the profits of the land for his wages; and when he died, his &s;ervice being at an end, there could no longer be a claim for wages. The &s;ubject returned to the &s;uperior, and he drew the whole profits, till the heir appeared; who was en|titled by the original covenant, upon per|forming the &s;ame &s;ervice with his ance&s;tor, to demand po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land as his wages. If his claim was found ju&s;t, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was delivered to him by a very &s;imple form, <HI>viz.</HI> an order or precept from
<PB N="112" REF="111">
the &s;uperior to give him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and this was called <HI>renovatio feudi.</HI> There is nothing to be laid hold of, in any branch of this proce&s;s, for making the heir liable to the ance&s;tor's debts. By performing the feudal &s;ervices, every heir is entitled to the full enjoyment of the land in name of wages; and his right being thus limited, he hath no power of di&s;po&s;al, or of contract|ing debt to affect the &s;ubject farther than his own intere&s;t reaches. The next heir who &s;ucceeds is not liable to the predece&s;&s;or's debts; becau&s;e the land is delivered to the next heir, not as the predece&s;&s;or's proper|ty, but as the property of the &s;uperior; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is given to the next heir as wages, for the &s;ervice he hath under|taken to perform. From this &s;hort &s;ketch it mu&s;t be evident, that, while the feudal law &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in its purity, a va&s;&s;al's debts after his death, however effectual again&s;t his moveables, could not burden the land, nor the heir who &s;ucceeded to the land.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="112">
BUT after land was re&s;tored to com|merce, and a va&s;&s;al was under&s;tood to be in &s;ome &s;ort proprietor, &s;o as even to have a power of alienation, it was a natural con&s;equence, that the land, as his property, &s;hould be &s;ubjected for payment of his debts, not only during his life, but even after his death. And indeed if a man's moveables can, after his death, be attached for payment of his debts, why not his land; &s;uppo&s;ing him equally proprietor of both? Accordingly by the law of England, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Judg|ments of all kinds, whether <HI>in foro con|tentio&s;o,</HI> or by con&s;ent, may be made ef|fectual by an <HI>elegit,</HI> after the debtor's death, as well as during his life, without nece&s;&s;ity of taking a new judgment a|gain&s;t the heir<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New abridgment of the law, vol.

<P>THE &s;ame method takes place in other debts, upon which there is no judgment again&s;t the debtor; with this only varia|tion, that the creditor mu&s;t begin with tak|ing a decree again&s;t the heir; becau&s;e the authority of a decree is nece&s;&s;ary for exe|cution. The decree taken again&s;t the heir is, in this ca&s;e, of the nature of a decreet of cognition with us, to be a foundation for attaching the decea&s;ed debtor's heri|tage, but not to have any per&s;onal effect again&s;t the heir, nor again&s;t his proper e&s;tate<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. III. page 25.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="114">
NOR is it difficult to di&s;cover the foun|dation of this practice. It depends on a principle of ju&s;tice, which is &s;imple and ob|vious, that every man's proper effects ought to be applied for payment of his debts. His death can have no &s;uch effect naturally, as to withdraw the&s;e effects from his credi|tors: nor can it have &s;uch effect as to &s;ub|ject the heir, who ought not to be liable for debts not of his own contracting; un|le&s;s &s;o far as he converts to his own u&s;e the ance&s;tor's effects, which are the only fund de&s;tined by law for payment of the ance&s;tor's debts.</P>
<P>THE natural principle which prevails in England, that an heir is not &s;ubjected to his ance&s;tor's debts, but only the ance&s;tor's own funds, produced another effect, which is, to ve&s;t in the heir the property of the ance&s;tor's heretable e&s;tate, even without exerting any act of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The very &s;urvivance of the heir gives him, in the law-language of England, legal &s;ei&s;in, that
<PB N="116" REF="115">
is, gives him all the advantages of real po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and ju&s;tly, becau&s;e his <HI>animus po&s;&s;edendi</HI> is pre&s;umed, and mu&s;t always be pre&s;umed, where the apprehending po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion is attended with no ri&s;k. This is the &s;en&s;e of the maxim, <HI>Quod mortuus &s;a&s;it vivum,</HI> which obtains in France as well as in England; and of which we now &s;ee the foundation. This branch of the law of England, is not more beautiful by its &s;im|plicity, than by its equity and expediency. Nothing can be more &s;imple or expedient, than by mere &s;urvivance, to ve&s;t in the heir the e&s;tate that belonged to the an|ce&s;tor; and nothing can be more equitable than a <HI>&s;eparatio bonorum,</HI> by which the funds of the ance&s;tor are &s;et apart for pay|ment of his debts, without vexing the heir, who, in common ju&s;tice, ought not to be liable but for debts of his own contracting.</P>
<P>WE have great rea&s;on to pre&s;ume as to this matter, that our law was once the &s;ame with that of England, though we have
<PB N="117" REF="116">
now adopted different maxims, deviating far from natural equity, and from the &s;im|plicity and expediency of the Engli&s;h law. That our law was the &s;ame will readily be believed, when in this country of old we find the &s;ame effect given to judgments, that at pre&s;ent is given in England. In the 2d &s;tatute Robert I. cap. 19. &sect; 12. it is laid down with re&s;pect to debts due to mer|chants, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That in execution again&s;t the lands of the debtor, &s;a&s;ine &s;hall be given of all the lands which belonged to the debtor at the time of entering into the recognizance, in who&s;e ever hands they have &s;ince come, whether by infeftment or otherwi&s;e."</Q> This authority, it is true, relates to a decree of con&s;ent; but we are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that it was more privileged than a judgment <HI>in foro contentio&s;o;</HI> and if &s;o, there could be no difficulty of making a judgment effectual again&s;t the debtor's land, in the hands of his heir, or <HI>in here|ditate jacente.</HI> And we find traces of this very thing in our old law. In the above
<PB N="118" REF="117">
mentioned 2d &s;tatutes Robert I. &sect; ult. it is enacted, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That if a debtor die, the mer|chant creditor &s;hall not have his body, but &s;hall have execution again&s;t his lands, as there above laid down;"</Q> that is by a brieve out of the chancery directed to the &s;heriff, to deliver to the creditor all the goods and lands which belonged to the debtor, by a rea&s;onable extent. The like execution is authorized, Leg. Burg. cap. 94. even where the heir is entered. But this is not all: we have po&s;itive evi|dence, that &s;uch was the practice in Scot|land even after the beginning of the &s;ix|teenth century. There is upon record a charter of appri&s;ing, <HI>anno</HI> 1508, in favour of Richard Kine, who having been decern|ed to pay 20<HI>l.</HI> as cautioner for Patrick Wallance, obtained letters after Patrick's death for appri&s;ing his land. Patrick's heirs were edictally cited, and his land was appri&s;ed and adjudged to Richard, for pay|ment to him of the &s;aid &s;um; and this was done without any previous decree again&s;t

the heir, or charge to enter. A copy of this charter is annexed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, No. 8.</NOTE>; and upon &s;earch|ing the records, many more of the &s;ame kind may doubtle&s;s be found. In a matter of &s;uch antiquity, the&s;e authorities ought to convince us, that as to execution again&s;t a debtor's land-e&s;tate after his death, our old law was the &s;ame with the Engli&s;h law, and the &s;ame that continues to be the Engli&s;h law to this day.</P>
<P>AND if &s;uch was the law of Scotland with re&s;pect to execution after the debtor's death, upon decrees whether <HI>in foro</HI> or of con&s;ent, we can have no rea&s;onable doubt that the &s;ame form of execution did obtain where there was no judgment during the debtor's life; with this variation only, that there behoved to be a decree of cognition before execution could be awarded.</P>
<P>A man who treads the dark paths of antiquity, ought to proceed with circum|&s;pection,
<PB N="120" REF="119">
and be con&s;tantly on the watch. We have entertained hitherto little doubt about the right road; but in pro&s;ecuting our journey, appearances are not quite &s;o favourable. We &s;tumble unluckily upon the act 106. p. 1540, which &s;eems to pro|nounce, that far from proceeding in the right path, we have been wandering this while. In this &s;tatute it appears to be taken for granted, that if the heir avoided entering to the land, the ance&s;tor's credi|tors had no means to recover payment. Nay, a remedy is provided, by entitling them to appri&s;e the land after charging the heir to enter. The act, it is true, is con|ceived in terms &s;o ambiguous, as to make it doubtful whether the remedy concerns the creditors of the ance&s;tor or tho&s;e of the heir. But that it is calculated to re|lieve the former only, all our authors agree. And we have a &s;till greater authority, <HI>viz.</HI> the act 27. p. 1621, which proceeding upon the narrative, that the &s;aid &s;tatute regards the creditors only of the decea&s;ed,
<PB N="121" REF="120">
extends the &s;ame remedy to creditors of the heir. This, in effect, is declaring, not only that the creditors of the heir, before the 1621, had no execution again&s;t the an|ce&s;tor's land unle&s;s the heir their debtor was plea&s;ed to enter; but al&s;o, that not even the creditors of the ance&s;tor had, before the act 1540, any execution again&s;t the land unle&s;s the heir, who was not their debtor, was plea&s;ed to enter.</P>
<P>THESE are weighty authorities in &s;up|port of the &s;en&s;e univer&s;ally given to the &s;tatute 1540. And yet that the common law of Scotland, &s;hould impower every heir of a land-e&s;tate, by ab&s;taining from the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, to forfeit the creditors of his ance&s;|tor, is a propo&s;ition too repugnant to the common principles of ju&s;tice to gain credit. This propo&s;ition will appear &s;till more ab|&s;urd, by bringing the &s;uperior into the que&s;|tion. The land returned to him, if the heir did not &s;ubmit to be his va&s;&s;al: but a good under&s;tanding betwixt them, perhaps for a
<PB N="122" REF="121">
valuable con&s;ideration, might entitle the heir to hold the land in defiance of all the creditors. To accompli&s;h a &s;cheme &s;o fraudulent, no more was nece&s;&s;ary but a private agreement, that the land &s;hould re|turn to the &s;uperior by e&s;cheat, and be afterwards re&s;tored to the heir by a new grant. A contrivance &s;o gro&s;sly unju&s;t would not have been tolerated in any coun|try. We had appri&s;ings of land as early as the reign of Alexander II. I have de|mon&s;trated above, that it is no &s;tretch of legal authority, to i&s;&s;ue this execution after the debtor's death more than during his life, and that the heir hath no title to pre|vent this execution whether he be entered or not entered. Let it further be con&s;i|dered, that, by our olde&s;t law, the heir was liable even for moveable debts, where the moveables were deficient<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reg. Maj. L. 2. cap. 39. &sect; 3.</NOTE>. What then was to bar law from taking its natural cour&s;e? It is certain there lay no bar in the way; and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an exe|cution
<PB N="123" REF="122">
mu&s;t have been obvious to the meane&s;t capacity, in order to fulfil the rules of common ju&s;tice; not to mention its uti|lity for &s;upporting credit and extending commerce.</P>
<P>BUT it is lo&s;ing time, to argue thus at large about the con&s;truction of a &s;tatute. The above mentioned charter 1508 makes it clear, that the &s;tatute cannot relate to the creditors of the ance&s;tor. By that charter it is vouched, that in the 1508, execution again&s;t the debtor's e&s;tate pro|ceeded after his death, with as little ce|remony as during his life. The practice mu&s;t have been the &s;ame in the 1540, and therefore as the creditors of the decea&s;ed had no occa&s;ion for a remedy, the remedy provided by the &s;tatute mu&s;t have been in|tended for the creditors of the heir. And to fortify this con&s;truction, there is luckily di&s;covered another remarkable fact. Our &s;overeign court, &s;o far from doubting of the privilege that creditors have to attach
<PB N="124" REF="123">
the land-e&s;tate of their debtor after his death, ventured to authorize an appri&s;ing of the predece&s;&s;or's e&s;tate upon the debt even of the heir-apparent. One in&s;tance of this I find in a charter of appri&s;ing, 24th May 1547, granted by Queen Mary to the Ma&s;ter of Semple. This charter &s;ub&s;umes, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Earl of Lennox, in order to protect his family-e&s;tate from being attached for payment of a debt due by him per&s;onally to the Queen, had refu&s;ed to enter heir to the &s;aid e&s;tate; that he had been charged to en|ter heir within twenty one days, under certification, that the lands &s;hould be ap|pri&s;ed as if he were really entered: and that he having di&s;obeyed the charge, the lands were accordingly appri&s;ed, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a copy of this charter, Appendix, N^o. 9.</NOTE>"</Q> The date of the charge to enter is omitted in the charter; but that it mu&s;t have been before the &s;tatute 1540, is evident from the following circum&s;tances, that the &s;tatute is not mentioned in the charter; and that the
<PB N="125" REF="124">
charge is upon twenty one days, which &s;hows that it proceeded not upon the au|thority of the &s;tatute; for in that ca&s;e the charge mu&s;t have been on forty days. We have no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e this to be a &s;in|gular in&s;tance; nor is it mentioned in the charter as &s;ingular. Here then is di&s;covered an important link in the hi&s;torical chain, to wit, that a charge again&s;t the heir to enter at the in&s;tance of his own creditor, was introduced by the &s;overeign court, without the authority of a &s;tatute. And if this hold true, the act 1540 could not be intended for any other effect, but to confirm this former practice, with the &s;ingle variation, that the charge to enter &s;hould be upon forty days in place of twenty one. Viewing this curious fact in its true light, it affords convincing evidence, that before the 1540, the debtor's death did not bar his creditors from acce&s;s to his e&s;tate. For it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the natural progre&s;s of improvements, that the common law &s;hould be &s;tretched in favour of the cre|ditors
<PB N="126" REF="125">
of the heir-apparent; while the pre|dece&s;&s;or's own creditors, who&s;e connection with his e&s;tate is incomparably &s;tronger, were left without a remedy. The&s;e cre|ditors mu&s;t have been long &s;ecure, before a remedy would be thought of for remoter creditors, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e of the heir-apparent.</P>
<P>BUT in combating the authority of the &s;aid act 1621, we mu&s;t not re&s;t &s;atisfied with &s;uch proofs as may be reckoned &s;uffi|cient in an ordinary ca&s;e. I add therefore other proofs, that will probably be thought &s;till more direct. In the fir&s;t edition of the &s;tatutes of James V. bearing date 8th February 1541, the title prefixed to the &s;tatute under con&s;ideration is in the follow|ing words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The remeid again&s;t them that lye out of their lands, and will not enter in defraud of their creditors."</Q> This clearly &s;hows what was under&s;tood to be the meaning of the &s;tatute at the time it was enacted, <HI>viz.</HI> that it re&s;pects the creditors &s;olely of the heir-apparent. And
<PB N="127" REF="126">
the &s;ame title is al&s;o prefixed to the next edition, which was in the 1566. The other proof I have to mention, appears to be altogether deci&s;ive. Upon &s;earching the records, it is di&s;covered, that the fir&s;t charges given by authority of the &s;tatute, were at the in&s;tance of creditors of heirs|apparent; one of them as early as the year 1542. This I take to be demon&s;trative evidence of the intendment of the &s;tatute; for we cannot indulge &s;o wild a thought, as that our judges, the very per&s;ons pro|bably who framed this &s;tatute, were igno|rant of its meaning.</P>
<P>As the foregoing arguments and proofs &s;eem to be invincible, we mu&s;t acknow|ledge, however unwillingly, that our legi&s;|lature, when they made the act 1621, were, in one particular, ignorant of the law of their own country. They are not however altogether without excu&s;e. I &s;hall have occa&s;ion immediately to &s;how, that long before the year 1621, the old form of exe|cution
<PB N="128" REF="127">
again&s;t land after the death of the debtor, &s;imple and ea&s;y as it was, had been abandoned, and another form &s;ub&s;tituted, not le&s;s tedious than intricate, which, con|&s;idered in a &s;uperficial view, might lead our legi&s;lature into an opinion, that the cre|ditors of the heir-apparent were not pro|vided for by the &s;tatute 1540. In fact they adopted this erroneous opinion, which moved them to make the act 1621.</P>
<P>No &s;ort of &s;tudy contributes more to the knowledge of law, than that which traces it through its different periods and changes. Upon this account, the forego|ing enquiry, though long, will, it is hoped, not be thought tedious or improper. In reality it is not practicable, with any degree of per&s;picuity, to handle the pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject, without fir&s;t a&s;certaining the true pur|po&s;e of the act 1540. For according to the interpretation commonly received, how ridiculous mu&s;t the attempt appear, of tracing from the beginning the form by
<PB N="129" REF="128">
which debts are made effectual after the death of the debtor, where the heir re|nounces or avoids entering; while it re|mains an e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion, that creditors were left without a remedy till the &s;tatute was made.</P>
<P>HAVING thus paved the way, by remov|ing a great deal of rubbi&s;h, I proceed to unfold the principles that govern our pre|&s;ent form of attaching land and other heretable &s;ubjects after the death of the debtor.</P>
<P>IT is a matter which cannot rationally admit of a doubt, that our notion of an heir was once the &s;ame with what is &s;ug|ge&s;ted by the common principles of law, <HI>viz.</HI> one who by will or by blood is en|titled to &s;ucceed to the heritage of a per|&s;on decea&s;ed, wholly or partially. Nay, we have the &s;ame notion at pre&s;ent, with re&s;pect to all heirs who &s;ucceed in parti|cular &s;ubjects, &s;uch as an heir of conque&s;t,
<PB N="130" REF="129">
an heir male an heir of entail, an heir of provi&s;ion. Nor is there the lea&s;t rea&s;on or occa&s;ion to view even an heir of line in a different light. For what more proper definition of an heir of line, than the per|&s;on who &s;ucceeds by right of blood to every heretable &s;ubject belonging to the decea&s;ed, which is not by will provided to another heir? And yet, with re&s;pect to the heir of line, we have unluckily adopted the artificial principles of the Roman law, of a per&s;onal repre&s;entation, and of identity of per&s;on, according to the Roman fiction, that the heir is <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum defuncto.</HI> The Roman law, illu&s;trious for its equitable maxims, de&s;erves ju&s;tly the greate&s;t regard. But the bulk of its in&s;titutions, however well adapted to the civil polity of Rome, and the nature of its government, make a very motley figure when grafted upon the laws of other nations. In this country, ever famous for love of novelty, the pre|vailing e&s;teem for the Roman law, has been confined within no rational bounds. Not
<PB N="131" REF="130">
&s;atisfied with following its equitable max|ims, we have adopted its peculiarities, even where it deviates from the common prin|ciples of ju&s;tice. The very in&s;tance now under con&s;ideration, without nece&s;&s;ity of making a collection, is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify this reflection. No man can he&s;itate a mo|ment, to prefer the beautiful &s;implicity and equity of our old law concerning heirs, be|fore the artificial &s;y&s;tem of the Romans, by which an heir cannot demand what of right belongs to him, without hazarding all he is worth in this world. No regulation can be figured more contradictory to equity and expediency: and yet &s;uch has been the in|fluence of the Roman law, that as far as po&s;&s;ible, we have relinqui&s;hed the former for the latter; that is, with re&s;pect to general heirs; for as to heirs of conque&s;t, heirs of provi&s;ion, and all heirs who &s;ucceed to par|ticular &s;ubjects, their condition is &s;o oppo|&s;ite to that of an heir in the Roman law, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, by any &s;tretch of fancy, to apply the Roman fiction to them.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="131">
THIS unlucky fiction, which &s;uppo&s;es the heir and ance&s;tor to be the &s;ame per&s;on, hath produced that intricate form pre&s;ent|ly in u&s;e, for recovering payment of debt after the death of the debtor. The credi|tors originally had no concern with the heir: their claim lay again&s;t their debtor's effects, which they could directly attach for their payment, whether <HI>in hereditate jacente</HI> or in the hands of the heir. But when the maxim of repre&s;entation and identity of per&s;on came to prevail, the whole order of execution was rever&s;ed. By the heir's a&s;&s;uming the character of repre|&s;entative, and by becoming <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum defuncto,</HI> the ance&s;tor's effects are with|drawn from his creditors, and are ve&s;ted in the heir as formerly in the ance&s;tor. In a &s;trict legal &s;en&s;e, a debtor who has a re|pre&s;entative dies not; his exi&s;tence is con|tinued in his heir, and the debtor is not changed. In this view the heir comes in effect to be the original debtor; and the creditors cannot reach the effects otherwi&s;e
<PB N="133" REF="132">
than upon his failure of payment, more than if he were in reality, in&s;tead of ficti|tiou&s;ly, the original debtor.</P>
<P>THE foregoing ca&s;e of an heir's taking the benefit of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is &s;elected from many that belong to this &s;ubject, in order to be handled in the fir&s;t place; for being of all the &s;imple&s;t, it furni&s;hes an opportu|nity to examine with the greater per&s;pi|cuity, what it was that moved our forefa|thers, to give up their accu&s;tomed form of execution for that pre&s;ently in u&s;e. This new form of execution again&s;t the heir when entered, was probably e&s;tabli&s;hed long before the &s;ixteenth century. We di&s;cover from our olde&s;t law-books, and in parti|cular from the Regiam Maje&s;tatem, that our forefathers began early to reli&s;h the maxims of the Roman law. And though in this book we di&s;cover no direct traces of the fiction that makes the heir and the ance&s;tor to be the &s;ame per&s;on, it is pro|bable however, con&s;idering the &s;wift pro|gre&s;s
<PB N="134" REF="133">
of the Roman law in this country, that the fiction obtained a currency with us not long after the Regiam Maje&s;tatem. Hence it is likely, that the old form of ap|pri&s;ing the land for the predece&s;&s;or's debt, without regarding the heir, mu&s;t have been long in di&s;u&s;e, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, where the property is by &s;ervice transferred to the heir; and who thereby is &s;ubjected per&s;o|nally to all the predece&s;&s;or's debts. This ca&s;e undoubtedly gave a commencement to the form pre&s;ently in u&s;e, which requires, that the e&s;tate be attached, not as belong|ing to the ance&s;tor the original debtor, but as belonging to the heir. In this view, a decree goes again&s;t the heir, making him liable for the debt; and thereafter adjudication pa&s;&s;es again&s;t the e&s;tate, as his property and as for payment of his debt. But though the new form commenced &s;o early, we have no rea&s;on to believe it was &s;o early compleated. Where an heir lyes out unentered, and intermeddles not with the ance&s;tor's effects, he cannot, in
<PB N="135" REF="134">
that &s;ituation, be held as <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum defuncto;</HI> and an e&s;tate to which the heir lays no claim, is naturally con&s;idered as &s;till belonging to the ance&s;tor. For the&s;e rea|&s;ons, there was in this ca&s;e nothing to ob|&s;truct the ance&s;tor's creditors from attach|ing the e&s;tate by legal execution, more than if their debtor were &s;till alive. According|ly, from the charter of appri&s;ing above mentioned, granted to Richard Kine, we find, that where the heir did not enter, the old form of attaching land was in u&s;e &s;o late as the 1508. Nor have we rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that this was the late&s;t in&s;tance of the kind; for where the creditors of the ance&s;tor, are willing to confine their views to his e&s;tate without attacking the heir, there cannot be a more ready method for an&s;wering their purpo&s;e, than that of ap|pri&s;ing the land, which might be done with as little ceremony as when the debtor was alive. A decree, it is true, was nece&s;&s;ary for this execution, as no execution can pro|ceed without the authority of a judge: but
<PB N="136" REF="135">
it was a matter of no difficulty to obtain a decree, if not already obtained again&s;t the debtor him&s;elf. The form is, to call the heir in a proce&s;s, not concluding again&s;t him per&s;onally, but only that the debt is true and ju&s;t. The heir has no concern here, but merely to repre&s;ent a defendant; and therefore a decree goes of cour&s;e, de|claring the debt to be ju&s;t. This declara|tory decree, commonly called a decreet of cognition, was held, and to this day is held, a &s;ufficient foundation for execution.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING that in the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, creditors after their debtor's death had acce&s;s to attach his land, in the manner now mentioned, and con&s;idering that a general charge was in practice before this time, as will by and by be proved, it appears to me evident, that this writ was invented, for no other pur|po&s;e but to reach the heir, and to &s;ubject him per&s;onally to the debts of his ance&s;tor; which may be gathered even from the writ
<PB N="137" REF="136">
it&s;elf. The heir was &s;ubjected if he entered; and this was a contrivance to reach him, if po&s;&s;ible, where he was not entered. This writ, as will be &s;hown by and by, produced the pre&s;ent form of execution for recover|ing payment after the debtor's death, and thereby occa&s;ioned a con&s;iderable revolu|tion in our law; which makes it of import|ance to trace its hi&s;tory with all po&s;&s;ible accuracy.</P>
<P>To have a ju&s;t notion of letters of ge|neral charge, we mu&s;t view the condition of an heir-apparent with relation to the &s;uperior. The heir-apparent has a year to deliberate, whether it will be his intere&s;t to enter to the land, and &s;ubject him&s;elf to all the duties incumbent on the va&s;&s;al. And he may al&s;o continue to deliberate after the year runs out, until he be compelled in the following manner to declare his will. The &s;uperior obtains a letter from the King, giving authority to charge or require the heir to enter within forty days, under the
<PB N="138" REF="137">
penalty of forfeiting his right to the feudal &s;ubject. This furni&s;hed a hint to credi|tors who wanted to make the heir liable. A &s;imilar form was invented, which had the &s;anction of the &s;overeign court without a &s;tatute. A creditor obtains a letter from the King, giving authority to charge or require the heir to enter within forty days; and to certify him, that his di&s;obedience &s;hall &s;ubject him per&s;onally to the creditor, in the &s;ame manner as if he were entered. This letter, commonly called Letters of General Charge, being &s;erved on the heir, obliges him to come to a re&s;olution. If he obey the charge by entering, he is of cour&s;e &s;ubjected to all his ance&s;tor's debts. If he remain in his former &s;ituation with|out entering, the charge is a medium upon which he may be decerned per&s;onally to make payment to the creditor in who&s;e favour the letter is i&s;&s;ued; and therefore to avoid being liable, he has no other method but to renounce the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which is done by a formal writing under
<PB N="139" REF="138">
his hand, put into the proce&s;s or into the record.</P>
<P>AT what time the general charge was introduced, cannot with accuracy be deter|mined. That it was known long before the &s;tatute 1540, appears from a deci&s;ion cited by Balfour, dated <HI>anno</HI> 1551<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors, chap. 17.</NOTE>, in which it is mentioned as a writ in common and general u&s;e; not at all as recent or newly invented. Its antiquity is further a&s;cer|tained by an argument, which, though negative, mu&s;t have con&s;iderable weight. The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, the &s;ame that is now in being, was e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>anno</HI> 1532; and though the mo&s;t ancient records of this court are not entire, we have however pretty great certainty of its regulations, &s;uch of them at lea&s;t as are of importance; for the&s;e, where the records are lo&s;t, may be gathered from our authors, and from other authentick evidence. But as there is not in any author, or in any writing,
<PB N="140" REF="139">
the &s;malle&s;t hint that this writ was intro|duced by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion; we have good rea&s;on to conclude, that it had a more early date.</P>
<P>THE better to under&s;tand what follows, we mu&s;t take a deliberate view of this new writ. To &s;upply defects in the common law, is undoubtedly the province of the &s;o|vereign court, and is one of its mo&s;t va|luable prerogatives. But then, regulations of this &s;ort ought not only to be founded on nece&s;&s;ity, but al&s;o on material ju&s;tice. Unhappily, neither of the&s;e grounds can be urged, to ju&s;tify letters of general charge. For fir&s;t, this writ, when invented, was in no view nece&s;&s;ary; the common law giving ready acce&s;s to a debtor's effects after his death for payment of his debts, as well as during his life; and beyond this a creditor can have no ju&s;t claim. In the next place, this writ, with re&s;pect to the heir-apparent, is oppre&s;&s;ive and unju&s;t: for while the ef|fects of the debtor ly open to execution,
<PB N="141" REF="140">
what earthly concern has the creditor with an heir, who hath not claimed the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, nor intermedled with the effects? and why &s;hould any attempt be indulged, to &s;ubject a man to the payment of debt not of his own contracting? This hete|roclite writ, procured, in all appearance, by the undue influence of creditors, hath in its con&s;equences proved even to them an unhappy contrivance. It evidently pro|duced our pre&s;ent form of obtaining pay|ment after the debtor's death, which, as ob&s;erved, being unju&s;t as to the heir, has recoiled again&s;t the creditors, by involving them in an execution, intricate, tedious, and expen&s;ive; oppo&s;ite in every particu|lar to the &s;imple and beautiful form e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the common law. I proceed to &s;how in what manner the general charge produced a revolution &s;o important.</P>
<P>REFLECTING upon this &s;ubject, it will be found, that after the charge is given, and the forty days elap&s;ed, the creditor
<PB N="142" REF="141">
charging has it no longer in his power to retreat, or in quality of the ance&s;tor's cre|ditor, to attach by real execution, the e&s;tate as belonging to the ance&s;tor. Such nece&s;|&s;arily mu&s;t be the effect of the change of circum&s;tances occa&s;ioned by this charge. If the heir obey the charge by entering, he occupies the place of the ance&s;tor: he is, in a legal &s;en&s;e, the ance&s;tor; and execution proceeds again&s;t him and his effects, pre|ci&s;ely as if he were really, and not by a fiction, the original debtor. This ca&s;e there|fore bars all acce&s;s to the original form of execution. The ance&s;tor is withdrawn as if he had never been; and upon that &s;uppo&s;ition the e&s;tate cannot be appri&s;ed as his property. In the next place, if the heir remain in his former &s;ituation, without de|claring his mind, he becomes per&s;onally liable, preci&s;ely as if he had entered. This &s;ituation, equally with the former, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, bars the creditor from having acce&s;s to the e&s;tate by the old form of execution. So &s;oon as the debt is trans|ferred
<PB N="143" REF="142">
again&s;t the heir, he &s;o far becomes <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum defuncto.</HI> With regard to this debt, he is con&s;idered to be the ori|ginal debtor; and as the creditor no longer enjoys the character of the ance&s;tor's credi|tor, he cannot have acce&s;s to the e&s;tate as belonging to the ance&s;tor; neither can he have acce&s;s to it as creditor to the heir, who him&s;elf hath no right until he enter. Again, if the heir renounce, the e&s;tate re|turns to the &s;uperior, who mu&s;t have the land if he have not a va&s;&s;al; and by this means al&s;o the creditor is excluded from all acce&s;s to the land; becau&s;e it is now no longer the property either of the ance&s;tor or of the heir. The&s;e con&s;equences of a charge, where the heir enters not, appear to to be &s;trong ob&s;tacles again&s;t the creditor wanting to attach the land. In what man|ner they were &s;urmounted, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how.</P>
<P>I begin with the ca&s;e where the heir-apparent, after he is charged, remains &s;ilent,
<PB N="144" REF="143">
and neither enters nor renounces. The charge in this ca&s;e, for the rea&s;on above mentioned, &s;ubjects him per&s;onally to the creditor at who&s;e in&s;tance he is charged; and by the &s;ame means he may be &s;ubjected to all the creditors. So far good. The creditors upon this medium may proceed to per&s;onal execution. But as to real execu|tion, the difficulty is great; for, as above ob&s;erved, the debt by the charge being laid upon the heir, there cannot be acce&s;s to the land otherwi&s;e than as belonging to him. But then, how can land be adjudged from a debtor who is not ve&s;ted in the property? The reader will advert, that he is engaged in a period long before the &s;tatute 1540, affording relief to the proper creditors of the heir by means of a &s;pecial charge. Admitting only the heir to be ju&s;tly &s;ubjected to his ance&s;tor's debts, which, with re&s;pect to what is now under con&s;ide|ration, mu&s;t be admitted, it becomes un|que&s;tionably his duty to enter to the land, in order to give the creditors acce&s;s to it
<PB N="145" REF="144">
for their payment. And if he prove re|fractory, it becomes the duty of the &s;ove|reign court to interpo&s;e and to perform for him by &s;elling the land, or at lea&s;t by adjudging it to the creditors for their pay|ment. The latter was accordingly done. But before attempting an extraordinary remedy, as good order requires, the debtor's ob&s;tinacy to be fir&s;t a&s;certained; a &s;e|cond letter in that view is obtained from the King, giving authority to charge or require the heir, to enter to the land within forty days; and to certify him, that, after the lap&s;e of this term, he &s;hall be held, with re&s;pect to the creditors, as actually entered. This method &s;olves all difficul|ties. The creditors proceed to appri&s;e the land from the heir, now their debtor, in the &s;ame manner as if he had a compleat title to the &s;ame by a &s;olemn entry.</P>
<P>IN the ca&s;e of a renunciation, the ob|&s;tacle is much greater than in that la&s;t mentioned. A renunciation to be heir, ac|cording
<PB N="146" REF="145">
to the nature of feudal property, is a total bar to the ance&s;tor's creditors, which could not have been &s;urmounted, and ought not to have been &s;urmounted, while the feudal law was in vigour. In the ori|ginal feudal &s;y&s;tem an heir hath no claim to the land which his ance&s;tor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, unle&s;s he undertake to &s;erve the &s;uperior in quality of a va&s;&s;al; and therefore if he re|fu&s;e to &s;ubmit to this &s;ervice, the &s;uperior enters to po&s;&s;e&s;s the land, which antece|dently was his property. But a renuncia|tion to be heir, though obtained at the &s;uit of a creditor, being however an expre&s;s declaration by the heir, that he will not &s;ubmit to be va&s;&s;al, mu&s;t, in &s;trict law, have the effect to re&s;tore the land to the &s;upe|rior, and to cut out all the creditors. This, as ob&s;erved, would originally have been thought no hard&s;hip. But at the time we adopted the notions of the Roman law, the bulk of the land in Scotland had pa&s;&s;ed from hand to hand for a full price paid; and &s;uch a purcha&s;e, contrary to the ori|ginal
<PB N="147" REF="146">
con&s;titution of the feudal law, trans|ferred the property to the purcha&s;er, though, according to the form of our land-rights, he is obliged to a&s;&s;ume the character of a va&s;&s;al. And therefore, whatever effect a renunciation might have while a va&s;&s;al's right was merely u&s;ufructuary, it was right|ly judged, that it ought not to have the &s;ame effect where the va&s;&s;al, in reality, is pro|prietor. Equity pleaded &s;trongly for the creditors, that the &s;uperior, <HI>certans de lucro captando,</HI> ought not to be preferred to them, <HI>certantes de damno evitando.</HI> The&s;e con&s;ide|rations moved the &s;overeign court, to think of &s;ome remedy for relieving the creditors. It would have been too bold an attack up|on e&s;tabli&s;hed law, to declare, that, in this ca&s;e, a renunciation &s;hould not operate in favour of the &s;uperior, but only of the cre|ditors. The court took &s;ofter mea&s;ures. The law was permitted to have its cour&s;e, in re&s;toring the land to the &s;uperior. But action was &s;u&s;tained to the creditors again&s;t the &s;uperior, to infeft them in the land for
<PB N="148" REF="147">
&s;ecurity and payment of their debts; and the decree given in this proce&s;s obtained the name of an adjudication upon a renun|ciation to be heir, or an adjudication <HI>cog|nitionis cau&s;a;</HI> which being afterwards mo|delled into a different form, pa&s;&s;es now com|monly under the name of an adjudication <HI>contra hereditatem jacentem.</HI> Here was in|vented a new &s;ort of execution again&s;t land, &s;imilar in its form to no other &s;ort in prac|tice. And it may be thought &s;trange, why the court, in imitation of the e&s;tabli&s;hed form of appri&s;ing, did not rather direct the land to be &s;old for payment of the credi|tors. In matters of &s;o great antiquity, where hi&s;tory affords &s;carce any light, it is diffi|cult to give &s;atisfaction upon every point. I can form no conjecture more probable, than that, in contriving a remedy again&s;t the hard&s;hips of the common law, the court thought they had no &s;ufficient authority to award a compleat execution, &s;uch as was given by the common law; and that it was venturing far enough to afford the
<PB N="149" REF="148">
creditors a &s;ecurity, upon land which once indeed belonged to their debtor, but was now legally transferred to the &s;uperior with whom they had no connection.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to other heretable &s;ub|jects, allodial in their nature as not held of any &s;uperior, heir&s;hip moveables, for ex|ample, bonds &s;ecluding executors, and di&s;|po&s;itions of land without infeftment, the heirs renunciation created no difficulty. Subjects of this kind are by the renuncia|tion left <HI>in media</HI> without an owner; and it is an obvious as well as a natural &s;tep, to adjudge them to a creditor for his pay|ment. By &s;uch adjudication the court doth nothing but what the debtor him&s;elf ought to have done when alive; and which it is pre&s;umed he would have done, had he not been prevented by death. This particular adjudication, it is probable, was the fir&s;t that came into u&s;e, and paved the way to an adjudication of land, when it returned to the &s;uperior by the heir's renunciation.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="149">
IF the general charge be of an ancient date, we cannot have much difficulty about the aera of the &s;pecial charge. For as the general charge is a very imperfect remedy without the &s;pecial charge, the invention of the latter could not be at any di&s;tance of time from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the for|mer. And a fact is mentioned above, which puts this matter beyond conjecture. Before the &s;tatute 1540, we find relief by a &s;pecial charge afforded even to the proper credi|tors of the apparent heir; which proves to conviction, that the &s;ame relief mu&s;t have been afforded long before to the creditors of the ance&s;tor, after the heir is made liable by a general charge. For, as above ob|&s;erved, it is not &s;uppo&s;able, that a remedy, afforded to the proper creditors of the heir|apparent, would be denied to the creditors of the decea&s;ed proprietor, who are more connected with the e&s;tate. According to the natural cour&s;e of human improvements, the creditors of the decea&s;ed proprietor, mu&s;t have been long privileged with a &s;pe|cial
<PB N="151" REF="150">
as well as with a general charge, before it would be thought proper to extend the privilege of a &s;pecial charge to the creditors of his heir-apparent.</P>
<P>IT appears from Craig<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L. 3. Dieg. 2. &sect; 23.</NOTE>, that an adju|dication <HI>cognitionis cau&s;a</HI> is the remedy which of all came late&s;t. We have this author's expre&s;s authority for &s;aying, that in his time it was a recent invention. Nor is this at all wonderful. For a renunciation to be heir, mu&s;t, to the ance&s;tor's creditors, be a puzzling circum&s;tance, when its legal effect is to re&s;tore the land to the &s;upe|rior, who is liable for none of the va&s;&s;al's debts.</P>
<P>TAKING under review the foregoing in|novations, to which we were in&s;en&s;ibly led by the prevailing influence of the Roman law, it is probable, that the fiction of iden|tity of per&s;on was fir&s;t applied by our law|yers to the ca&s;e where an heir regularly
<PB N="152" REF="151">
enters to the e&s;tate of his ance&s;tor. Being in this ca&s;e beneficial to creditors, who have the heir bound as well as the e&s;tate, it gained credit, and obtained a currency. Nor was it attended with any inconve|nience, to creditors at lea&s;t, while they had acce&s;s to appri&s;e, as formerly, the e&s;tate of their debtor, where the heir ab&s;tained from entering. This, one &s;hould think, was affording to creditors every privilege they could ju&s;tly demand for obtaining payment. But this did not &s;atisfy them. To have the heir bound per&s;onally, in place of his ance&s;tor, was an enticing pro&s;pect; and the general charge was invented, in or|der to make him liable before his entry, and where he has not taken the benefit of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This legal &s;tep, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, is pretty well contrived to an&s;wer its purpo&s;e. The heir, urged by a general charge, hath no way to evade the certification of being per&s;onally liable, other than the hard alternative of renouncing altogether the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This new form,
<PB N="153" REF="152">
for that rea&s;on was much reli&s;hed. Cre|ditors did not chu&s;e to confine them|&s;elves to the e&s;tate of the ance&s;tor their debtor, while any hope remained of &s;ub|jecting the heir per&s;onally, by means of a general charge. And accordingly for a century and a half, or perhaps more, it has been the con&s;tant method to &s;et out with a general charge, where the heir is not entered. If this method to &s;ubject the heir per&s;onally prove &s;ucce&s;sful, the credi|tors, as made out above, mu&s;t bid adieu to the e&s;tate con&s;idered as <HI>in hereditate jacente</HI> of their original debtor. Having cho&s;en the heir for their debtor, they cannot now attach the e&s;tate otherwi&s;e than in quality of his creditors. Thus it has happened, that during &s;o long time as that now men|tioned, there is no in&s;tance of following out the old form by appri&s;ing or adjudging the land after the debtor's death, without re|garding the heir. Whether it may be thought too late now to return to this old form, governed by the principles of
<PB N="154" REF="153">
ju&s;tice as well as of expediency, I take not upon me to determine.</P>
<P>THE difference betwixt the law of Scot|land and of England as to the pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject, will be clearly apprehended, by &s;etting the matter in the following light. A pure donation, which doth not &s;ubject the donee to any obligation, transfers property with|out the nece&s;&s;ity of acceptance; and upon that account, infants and ab&s;ents are be|nefited by &s;uch deeds, without knowing any thing of the matter. But a deed laying the donee under any burden, be&s;tows no right without actual acceptance: if it did, any man might be &s;ubjected to the &s;eve|re&s;t burdens without his con&s;ent. Thus, in England, the rule obtains, <HI>Quod mortuus &s;a&s;it vivum;</HI> becau&s;e an heir, though ve&s;ted in his ance&s;tor's heritage, is not &s;ubjected per&s;onally to his ance&s;tor's debts. In Scot|land again, the effects of the ance&s;tor are not tran&s;mitted to the heir, but by means of &s;ome voluntary act, which imports the
<PB N="155" REF="154">
con&s;ent of the heir to &s;ubject him&s;elf to his ance&s;tor's debts. For, by our law, a &s;trict connection is formed, betwixt the right that the heir has to the ance&s;tor's e&s;tate, and the obligation he is under to pay the ance&s;tor's debts, &s;o far at lea&s;t as that the latter is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the for|mer. It may indeed happen, that the heir is made liable to pay the ance&s;tor's debts, without being ve&s;ted in the e&s;tate; but this is to be con&s;idered as a penalty for refu&s;ing to enter heir when he is charged, or for intermeddling irregularly with the ance&s;tor's effects, which are &s;ingular ca&s;es.</P>
<P>THE matter of the foregoing hi&s;tory is &s;o &s;ingular, as not perhaps to have a pa|rallel in the law of any country. Here, from the dead law of an ancient people, we find a metaphy&s;ical fiction adopted, without any foundation in the common rules of ju&s;tice, and repugnant in a pe|culiar manner to the common law of this i&s;land; and yet &s;o fervently impraced, as
<PB N="156" REF="155">
to have made havock of every part of our law that &s;tood in oppo&s;ition. I have pointed out &s;ome of the many inconve|niencies that its reception produced, with regard to creditors, and con&s;equently to credit. I have &s;hown what &s;ubterfuges and fictitious contrivances were nece&s;&s;ary, in order to give it a currency. I have &s;hown how tedious, how intricate, and how expen&s;ive a form it hath occa&s;ioned, for re|covering payment of debt: but I have not yet &s;hown it in its wor&s;t light. The evils I have mentioned, are mere triffles com|pared with tho&s;e that follow. No per|&s;on who hath given any attention to the hi&s;tory of our law, can be ignorant of the numberle&s;s artifices invented by heirs in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the family-e&s;tates, to &s;creen them&s;elves from paying the family-debts. The numberle&s;s regulations made in vain, age after age, to prevent &s;uch artifices, will &s;atisfy every one, that there mu&s;t be an error in the fir&s;t concoction, by which a remedy is rendered extremely difficult.
<PB N="157" REF="156">
How comes it that we never hear of &s;uch frauds in England? The rea&s;on is obvious. The ju&s;t and natural rule of a <HI>&s;eparatio bonoruni,</HI> which obtains there, makes it impracticable for the heir to defraud his ance&s;tor's creditors. They have no con|cern with the heir, but take them&s;elves to the ance&s;tor's e&s;tate for their pay|ment. In Scotland, the ance&s;tor's e&s;tate cannot be reached, even by his own credi|tors, otherwi&s;e than by attacking the heir, unle&s;s he be plea&s;ed to abandon it to the creditors. But this &s;eldom was the ca&s;e of old. The heir had a more profitable game to play, even where the e&s;tate was overbur|dened with debts. His method generally was to renounce to be heir, in order to evade a per&s;onal decerniture: but he did not how|ever abandon the e&s;tate. It was &s;eldom difficult to procure &s;ome artificial or &s;icti|tious title to the e&s;tate, under cover of which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was apprehended; and this was a great point gained. If &s;uch title, after a dependance perhaps for years, was
<PB N="158" REF="157">
found in&s;ufficient to bar the creditors, ano|ther title of the &s;ame kind was provided; and &s;o on without end. It is true, the heir's renunciation entitles the creditors to attach the e&s;tate by adjudications <HI>cognitionis cau&s;a:</HI> but then the heir, as has been ob|&s;erved, was always provided with &s;ome col|lateral title, not only to colour his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, but al&s;o to compete with the credi|tors. In the mean time, the rents were a fund in his hands to take off any of the preferable creditors that were like to prove too hard for him. And &s;uch purcha&s;e was a new protection to the uncon&s;cientious heir, again&s;t the other creditors. In fact, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable e&s;tates in Scotland, are po&s;&s;e&s;t at this day by &s;uch di&s;hone&s;t titles; the legi&s;lature, however willing, ne|ver having been able to invent any com|pleat remedy to prevent &s;uch pernicious frauds. The foregoing ob&s;ervations will enable us to trace the&s;e artifices to their true &s;ource. They mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the fiction of identity of perron; becau&s;e by
<PB N="159" REF="158">
means of this fiction chiefly, opportunity was furni&s;hed for committing the&s;e frauds. Had this matter been &s;een by our legi&s;la|ture in its proper light, a very &s;imple and very effectual remedy mu&s;t have occurred to them. If the heir refu&s;ed to &s;ubject him|&s;elf to the debts of his ance&s;tor, nothing el&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary, but to re&s;tore the ancient law, authori&s;ing the ance&s;tor's heritage to be &s;old for payment of his debts. But this regulation had been long in di&s;u&s;e, and we were not le&s;s ignorant of it, than if it never had exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>AND, as an evidence of the weakne&s;s of human fore&s;ight, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that a &s;tatute made without any view to the frauds of heirs, proved more &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the&s;e frauds, than all the regulations purpo&s;ely made; and that is the &s;tatute for &s;elling the e&s;tates of bankrupts. An heir has now very little opportunity to play the accu&s;tomed game, when it is in the power of creditors to wre&s;t the e&s;tate out of his hands, by a pub|lick
<PB N="160" REF="159">
auction. And the experience now of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ifty years, has vouched this to be a com|pleat remedy. For we hear not at pre&s;ent of any frauds of this kind, nor are we under any apprehen&s;ion of them. So far from it, that we are receding more and more, every day, from the rigid principle of an univer&s;al repre&s;entation, and ap|proaching to the maxim of equity, which &s;ubjects not the heir beyond the value of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. For what other rea&s;on is it, that the act 1695, introducing &s;ome new rigid pa&s;&s;ive titles, is totally neglected, though it is undoubtedly an additional &s;afe-guard to creditors again&s;t the frauds of heirs? We are not now afraid of the&s;e frauds: they are prevented by the equi|table remedy of &s;elling the ance&s;tor's e&s;tate; and judges, if they have humanity, will be loath to apply a &s;evere remedy, when a mild one is at hand, which is al&s;o more effectual. It is remarkable, that though the act for &s;elling the e&s;tates of bankrupts proved an effectual remedy, yet this virtue
<PB N="161" REF="160">
in the &s;tatute was not an early di&s;covery. It was not di&s;covered at the time of the act 1695, and if any per&s;on, of more than ordinary penetration, had been looking on when that &s;tatute was made, it mu&s;t have provoked a &s;mile, to find our legi&s;lature, with their eyes open contriving an imper|fect remedy, when they had already, with their eyes &s;hut, &s;tumbled on one that was perfect.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF The LIMITED and UNIVERSAL Repre&s;entation of Heirs.</HEAD>
<P>BY the law of nature, an heir, beyond what he takes by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is not &s;ubjected to the debts of his an|ce&s;tor. In the Roman law a &s;ingular no|tion was adopted, that the heir is the &s;ame per&s;on with the ance&s;tor. Hence an heir, in the Roman law, &s;ucceeds to all the effects of the ance&s;tor, and is &s;ubjected to all his debts. This was carried &s;o far with regard
<PB N="164" REF="162">
to children, that they were heirs <HI>ex nece&s;&s;i|tate juris;</HI> and upon that account were di|&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>&s;ui et nece&s;&s;arii heredes.</HI> Natural principles afterwards pre|vailed, and children, in common with other heirs, were privileged to ab&s;tain from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This was done by a <HI>&s;eparatio bonorum,</HI> and by abandoning the goods of the ance&s;tor to his creditors. But &s;till if the heir took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the an|ce&s;tor's effects, or in any manner behaved as heir, he, from that moment, was under|&s;tood to be <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum defuncto,</HI> and con&s;equently was &s;ubjected univer&s;ally to all the ance&s;tor's debts. At la&s;t the benefit of inventory was afforded, which protected the heir from being liable farther than <HI>in va|lorem.</HI> This privilege, tempered the &s;everity of the foregoing artificial principle, and, in a manner, re&s;tored the law of nature, which had been overlooked for many ages.</P>
<P>IN England, the artificial principle of identity of per&s;on never took place. An
<PB N="165" REF="163">
heir, by the Engli&s;h law, is not bound to pay his ance&s;tor's debts, even when he takes by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The creditors have the pri|vilege of attaching their debtor's effects po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the heir, in the &s;ame manner as when the&s;e effects were in the debtor's own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, during his life. The heir is per|&s;onally liable to the extent only of what he intermeddles with. The Engli&s;h law in|deed deviates from natural ju&s;tice, in mak|ing a di&s;tinction betwixt the heritable and moveable debts, &s;ubjecting the heir to the former only, and the executor to the latter. This is evidently unju&s;t as to creditors; for they may be forfeited by their debtor's death, though he die in opulent circum|&s;tances, which as to per&s;onal creditors mu&s;t always happen, when his moveable funds are narrow and his moveable debts exten|&s;ive. Such a regulation is the le&s;s to be ju&s;tified, that it furni&s;heth an opportunity for fraud. For what if a man, with a view to di&s;appoint his per&s;onal creditors after his death, &s;hall lay out all his money upon land?
<PB N="166" REF="164">
I know of no remedy to this evil, unle&s;s the court of chancery, moved by a principle of equity, venture to interpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BY the feudal law, when in purity, there could not be &s;uch a thing as repre&s;entation; becau&s;e the heir took the land, not as com|ing in place of his ance&s;tor, but by a new grant from the &s;uperior. But when land was re&s;tored to commerce, and was pur|cha&s;ed for a full price, it was ju&s;tly reckoned the property of the purcha&s;er, though held in the feudal form. Land by this means is &s;ubjected to the payment of debt, even after it de&s;cends to the heir. And in Scot|land, probably, the privilege at fir&s;t was car|ried no farther than in England, to permit creditors, after the death of their debtor, to attach his funds in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heir.</P>
<P>BUT as Scotland always has been ad|dicted to innovations, the Roman law pre|vailed here, contrary to the genius of our own law; and the fiction was adopted of the
<PB N="167" REF="165">
heir and ance&s;tor being the &s;ame per&s;on. This fiction crept fir&s;t into the rea&s;onings of our lawyers, figuratively, in order to ex|plain certain effects in our own law; and gained by degrees &s;uch an a&s;cendant, as, in our apprehen&s;ion, to form the very charac|ter of an heir. Yet, con&s;idering the heirs of different kinds that are acknowledged with us, an heir of line, an heir-male, an heir of provi&s;ion, &amp;c. one &s;hould not imagine that our law lay open to have this fiction grafted upon it. In the Roman law there was but one heir who &s;ucceeded <HI>in univer&s;um jus defuncti,</HI> and who, by a very natural figure, might be &s;tiled <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum defuncto.</HI> But can we apply this figure, with any propriety, to an heir who &s;ucceeds not <HI>in univer&s;um jus,</HI> but is limited to a particu|lar &s;ubject?

OUR law in all probability was once the &s;ame with that of England, <HI>viz.</HI> that the heir who &s;ucceeds to the real e&s;tate, is liable to real debts only; the moveable debts be|ing laid upon the executor. But this did not long continue to be our law. It mu&s;t &s;ometimes have happened, notwith&s;tanding the frugality of ancient times, that the per&s;onal e&s;tate was not &s;ufficient for &s;atis|fying the per&s;onal debts. It was in this ca&s;e ju&s;tly thought hard, that the heir &s;hould enjoy the family-e&s;tate, while the per&s;onal creditors of his father, or other ance&s;tor, were left without remedy. Equity dictates, that after the moveables are ex|hau&s;ted, the per&s;onal creditors &s;hall have acce&s;s to the land for what remains due to them. This practice is with us of an early date. We find it e&s;tabli&s;hed in the reign of David II. as appears from the Regiam Maje&s;tatem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 39. &sect; 3.</NOTE>. And it was improved to the benefit of creditors by &s;tatute<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act 76. p. 1503.</NOTE>, enact|ing, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That if the per&s;onal creditors are
<PB N="169" REF="167">
not paid out of the moveables within the year, they &s;hall, without further de|lay, have acce&s;s to the heir."</Q> Upon the &s;ame foundation, and by analogy of the &s;tatute, the executor is made liable for the heretable debts. This came in late; for Sir Thomas Hope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Minor Practicks, &sect; 104.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Lords of old were not in u&s;e to &s;u|&s;tain proce&s;s again&s;t the executor for payment of an heretable debt."</Q> And he is &s;o little touched with the equity of the innovation, as to cen&s;ure and condemn it; for a very in&s;ufficient rea&s;on indeed; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"be|cau&s;e (&s;ays he) there is no law to give the executor relief again&s;t the heir, as the heir has again&s;t the executor when he pays a moveable debt;"</Q> as if this relief did not follow from the nature of the thing. Reviewing this hi&s;torical deduction, I cannot perceive in it the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ymptom of identity of per&s;on. This fiction ad|mits not of a di&s;tinction betwixt here|table and moveable &s;ubjects. Identity of
<PB N="170" REF="168">
per&s;on be&s;tows nece&s;&s;arily upon the heir every &s;ubject that belonged to the ance&s;tor. Neither admits it of any di&s;tinction among debts; for if the decea&s;ed was liable to all debts without di&s;tinction, &s;o mu&s;t the heir. In place of which we find the heir of line &s;ubjected, by the common law, to he|retable debts only; and not to moveable debts, otherwi&s;e than upon a principle of equity, which, if the moveables be not &s;uffi|cient, &s;ubjects the land-e&s;tate, rather than that the creditors &s;hould &s;uffer.</P>
<P>IT is then evident, that in our practice there is no place for this fiction, even with regard to the heir of line; and that this heir is &s;ubjected univer&s;ally to his ance&s;tor's debts, without any foundation in the com|mon law; and even without any foundation in the fiction it&s;elf. For as an heir of line is clearly not <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum defuncto,</HI> except as to the heretable e&s;tate, it is equally clear, that, by authority of this fiction, he ought not to be &s;ubjected uni|ver&s;ally
<PB N="171" REF="169">
to any debts but what are here|table. As to moveable debts, equity dic|tates that creditors be preferred to every repre&s;entative of their decea&s;ed debtor; and therefore that the land-e&s;tate &s;hould be &s;ub|jected to the per&s;onal creditors, when the moveables are not &s;ufficient. But this maxim of equity can never be extended farther again&s;t the heir, than to make him liable for moveable debts, &s;o far as he is be|nefited by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e equity, which relieves from oppre&s;&s;ion, can never be made the in&s;trument of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN the next place, as to a limited heir, &s;ucceeding to one &s;ubject only, why ought he to be liable univer&s;ally to the ance&s;tor's debts? If he repre&s;ent the ance&s;tor, it is not univer&s;ally, but only as heir in a parti|cular &s;ubject. And therefore, according to the nature of his repre&s;entation, he ought to be liable for debts only which affect that &s;ubject, or for debts of the &s;ame kind with the &s;ubject, or at farthe&s;t for debts of
<PB N="172" REF="170">
every kind to the extent of the &s;ubject. I know not that it has been held by any able writer, far le&s;s decided, that an heir provided to a particular &s;ubject is liable uni|ver&s;ally to the ance&s;tor's debts. Dirleton gives his opinion to the contrary in a mo&s;t &s;atisfying manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doubts. Tit. (Heirs of Tail&yogh;ie)</NOTE>. His words are: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Heirs of provi&s;ion and tail&yogh;ie who are to &s;uc|ceed only <HI>in rem &s;ingularem</HI> albeit <HI>titulo univer&s;ali; Quaeritur</HI> if they will be liable to the defuncts whole debts, though far exceeding the value of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; or if they &s;hould be con&s;idered as <HI>here|des cum beneficio inventarii,</HI> and &s;hould be liable only <HI>&s;ecundum vires,</HI> there being no nece&s;&s;ity of an inventory, the &s;ubject of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion being only, as &s;aid is, <HI>res &s;ingularis?</HI> An&s;wer. It is thought that if one be &s;erved general heir-male with|out relation to a &s;ingular &s;ubject (as to certain lands) he would be liable <HI>in &s;oli|dum;</HI> but if he be &s;erved only &s;pecial heir in certain lands, he &s;hould be liable only <HI>&s;ecundum vires.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="171">
THE heir of line, or heir general, is then the only per&s;on to whom the character of identity of per&s;on can with any &s;hadow of propriety be applied. Nor to him can it be applied in the unlimited &s;en&s;e of the Roman law; but only as to the heretable e&s;tate and heretable debts. To all that is carried by a general &s;ervice he has right, without limitation; and it is plau&s;ible if not &s;olid, that he ought to be liable without limitation, to all heretable debts, &s;uch as come under a general &s;ervice. We follow the &s;ame rule betwixt hu&s;band and wife, when we &s;ubject him to her move|able debts in general, and give him right to all her moveable effects in general. And this at the &s;ame time appears to be the true foundation of the privilege of di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, competent to heirs who&s;e right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is limited to particular &s;ubjects. The general heir, or heir of line, who is not thus limited, but &s;ucceeds in general to all &s;ubjects of a certain &s;pecies, is the only heir to whom the identity of per&s;on
<PB N="174" REF="172">
can with any colour be applied; and con|&s;equently is the only heir who ought to bear the burden of the debts.</P>
<P>IT may be thought more difficult to ex|plain, why an heir of line, making up titles by a &s;ervice to a land-e&s;tate which was the property of his ance&s;tor, &s;hould be &s;ubjected univer&s;ally to his ance&s;tor's debts; when this very title, <HI>viz.</HI> his retour and &s;ei&s;in, contains an inventory <HI>in gremio;</HI> not being in its nature a general title, but only a title to one particular &s;ubject.</P>
<P>To explain this matter di&s;tinctly, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to carry our view pretty far back in the hi&s;tory of our law. Among all nations it is held as a principle, that property is transferred from the dead to the living, without any &s;olemnity. Children, and other heirs, are entitled to continue the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ance&s;tor; and where the heir is not bound for his ance&s;tor's debts, &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is under&s;tood to be
<PB N="175" REF="173">
continued by will alone, without any ouvert act. In Scotland, the heir originally was not liable for the debts of his ance&s;tor, nor at pre&s;ent is he liable in England. Hence it is, that as to rent-charges, bonds &s;eclud|ing executors, and other heretable &s;ubjects, which may be termed allodial, becau&s;e not held of any &s;uperior, the&s;e were transferred to the heir of blood directly upon his &s;ur|vivance; and, with regard to the&s;e, the &s;ame rule obtained here, that obtains uni|ver&s;ally in England and France, <HI>Quod mor|tuus &s;a&s;it vivum.</HI> Land and other &s;ubjects held of a &s;uperior, are with us in a very different condition. The va&s;&s;al, by the principles of the feudal law, is not pro|prietor; and, &s;trictly &s;peaking, tran&s;mits no right to his heir. The &s;ubject mu&s;t be claimed from the &s;uperior; and the heir's title is a new grant from him. Thus then &s;tood originally the law of Scotland. He|retable &s;ubjects ve&s;ted in the heir merely by &s;urvivance. The &s;ingle exception was a feudal holding, which required, and &s;till
<PB N="176" REF="174">
requires a new grant from the &s;uperior. If the heir of line had this new grant, he needed no other title to claim any here|table &s;ubject which belonged to his ance&s;|tor. But heirs were put in a very different &s;ituation, by the fiction of identity of per|&s;on adopted from the Roman law. The heir by claiming the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, being &s;ub|jected per&s;onally to his ance&s;tor's debts, mu&s;t have an election to claim or to aban|don as it &s;uits his intere&s;t. This of ne|ce&s;&s;ity introduced an <HI>aditio hereditatis,</HI> as among the Romans, without which the heir can have no title to the effects of his ance&s;tor. If he u&s;e this form, he becomes <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum defuncto</HI> with regard to be|nefits as well as burdens. If he ab&s;tain from u&s;ing it, he is under&s;tood to abandon the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and to have no concern either with benefits or burdens. The only point to be con&s;idered was, what &s;hould be the form of the <HI>Aditio.</HI> By this time the pro|perty being transferred from the &s;uperior to his va&s;&s;al, it was ju&s;tly thought, that the
<PB N="177" REF="175">
va&s;&s;al's heir who enjoyed the land-e&s;tate of his ance&s;tor, could not evade payment of his debts. For this rea&s;on, an infeftment being the form e&s;tabli&s;hed for tran&s;mitting the property to the heir, the &s;ame form was now held as a proper <HI>aditio hereditatis</HI> to have the double effect, not only of ve&s;t|ing the heir with the property as formerly, but al&s;o of &s;ubjecting him to the ance&s;tor's debts. This title, it is true, being in its nature limited, ought not to &s;ubject him beyond the value of the &s;ubject. But then the identity of the ance&s;tor and his heir being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, it was thought, as in the Roman law, to have an univer&s;al effect, and to be an active title to every &s;ubject that could de&s;cend to the heir of line. And our former practice tended mainly to &s;upport this inference; for it was &s;till re|membered, that formerly all allodial here|table &s;ubjects were ve&s;ted in the heir of line, upon his &s;urvivance merely. The infeft|ment being thus held an <HI>aditio hereditatis,</HI> not only with re&s;pect to the land-e&s;tate, but
<PB N="178" REF="176">
with re&s;pect to all other heretable &s;ubjects, it followed of cour&s;e, that the infeftment behoved al&s;o to be an univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ive title; for if the heir &s;ucceeded to all heretable &s;ubjects without limitation, it &s;eemed not unrea&s;onable that he &s;hould be &s;ubjected to all debts without limitation. The&s;e con|clu&s;ions, it mu&s;t be owned, were far from being ju&s;t or accurate. It appears extreme|ly plain, that if a man die po&s;&s;e&s;t of a &s;ub|ject held of a &s;uperior, and of other he|retable &s;ubjects that are allodial, the heir ought to be privileged to make a title to one or other at his plea&s;ure, and to be &s;ub|jected accordingly to the debts; that if he u&s;e a general &s;ervice, he mu&s;t lay his ac|count to be liable univer&s;ally, but that if he confine him&s;elf to a &s;pecial &s;ervice, he is not to be liable beyond the value of the &s;ubject. But our ancient lawyers were not &s;o clear &s;ighted. They blindly followed the Roman law, by attributing to the iden|tity of per&s;on the mo&s;t exten&s;ive effects po&s;&s;ible. An infeftment in the land-e&s;tate
<PB N="179" REF="177">
e&s;tabli&s;hed this identity, which, it was thought, did on the one hand entitle the heir of line to all the heretable &s;ubjects, and on the other did &s;ubject him to all the debts. And this affords a clear &s;olution of the difficulty above mentioned. If the identity of per&s;on take at all place, it ap|plies to none more properly than to an heir of blood, who enters by infeftment; e&s;pe|cially as he generally is of the &s;ame name and family with his ance&s;tor, lives in the &s;ame hou&s;e, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;ame e&s;tate, and carries on the line of the &s;ame family.</P>
<P>BUT now &s;uppo&s;ing the foregoing de|duction to be ju&s;t, is there not great rea|&s;on to alter our pre&s;ent practice, and to hold a &s;pecial &s;ervice to be, as it truly is in its nature and form, a limited title? Let us &s;uppo&s;e that the heir of line, unwilling to repre&s;ent his ance&s;tor univer&s;ally, chu&s;es to abandon all the heretable &s;ubjects, except a &s;mall land-e&s;tate, to which he makes up titles by a &s;pecial &s;ervice; why &s;hould
<PB N="180" REF="178">
he be liable univer&s;ally in this ca&s;e? The natural con&s;truction of &s;uch a &s;ervice is, that the heir intends to confine him&s;elf to the &s;ubject therein mentioned, and to aban|don the ance&s;tor's other e&s;tate, &s;ince he for|bears to take out a general &s;ervice. Such con&s;truction will better the condition of heirs, by removing &s;ome part of the ri&s;k they run, and will not hurt creditors &s;o far as their claim is founded on natural equity, <HI>viz.</HI> to have their debtor's effects applied for payment of his debts.</P>
<P>AND I mu&s;t ob&s;erve with &s;ome &s;atisfac|tion, that we have given this very con|&s;truction to an infeftment upon a precept of <HI>Clare Con&s;tat;</HI> it being an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule, that &s;uch infeftment is not a title to any other &s;ubject but that contained in the precept. And for this very rea&s;on, neither doth it make the heir liable for the debts of his ance&s;tor farther than <HI>in valorem.</HI> Lord Stair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In&s;tit. page 467. at the foot.</NOTE>, it is true, con&s;iders a precept
<PB N="181" REF="179">
of <HI>Clare</HI> as an univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ive title. But the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion entertained a ju&s;ter no|tion of this matter. A remarkable ca&s;e is ob&s;erved by Lord Harcus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. (Heirs) March 1683, Farmer <HI>contra</HI> Elder.</NOTE>, to the fol|lowing purpo&s;e. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A man infeft upon a precept of <HI>Clare Con&s;tat</HI> as heir to his fa|ther, being pur&s;ued for payment of a debt that was due by his father; pleaded an ab&s;olvitor upon the following medium, that he had no benefit by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the &s;ubject to which he had connected by a precept of <HI>Clare</HI> being evicted from him."</Q> It was an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That his en|tering heir by the precept of <HI>Clare Con|&s;tat,</HI> made him <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum de|functo;</HI> that it was a behaviour as heir, which &s;ubjected him to all his prede|ce&s;&s;or's debts, without regard to the e&s;tate, whether it was &s;wallowed up by an earthquake, or evicted by a proce&s;s."</Q> The Lords <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"judged the defender not liable as heir, in re&s;pect the land was evicted from him."</Q> It was &s;aid, that had there
<PB N="182" REF="180">
been a general &s;ervice, or a &s;pecial &s;ervice which includes a general, the matter would have been more doubtful; e&s;pecially if there were other &s;ubjects to which a general &s;er|vice gives right. The plain inference from this judgment is, that if eviction of the land-e&s;tate relieve the heir from being liable to pay the family-debts, the e&s;tate mu&s;t be the mea&s;ure of his repre&s;entation, and con&s;equently that he is not liable beyond the value.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ubject will perhaps be thought unnece&s;&s;ary, now that the benefit of in|ventory is introduced into our law. It is indeed le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than formerly, but not however altogether u&s;ele&s;s. In many in&s;tances heirs neglect to lay hold of this benefit; and frequently the forms required by the &s;tatute are un&s;kilfully or carele&s;sly pro&s;ecuted, &s;o as to leave the heir open to the rigour of law, in all which ca&s;es it comes to be an important enquiry, how far an heir is liable for the
<PB N="183" REF="181">
debts of his ance&s;tor. I cannot at the &s;ame time help remarking, that it &s;hows no true ta&s;te for &s;cience, to relinqui&s;h a &s;ub|ject, however beautiful, merely becau&s;e it appears not to be immediately u&s;eful. The hi&s;tory of law, which unfolds a &s;ubject in its natural as well as political progre&s;s, can never be u&s;ele&s;s. And, taking it upon the lowe&s;t footing, it enables us to compare our pre&s;ent with our former practice, which always tends to in&s;truction.</P>

<P>At what time the que&s;tion about the yearly rent of the land was ingro&s;&s;ed in this brieve, is uncertain; probably after the days of William the Conqueror: for as all the lands in England were accurately valued in
<PB N="188" REF="185">
that King's reign, and the whole valuations collected into a record, commonly called Domes-day book, this authentick evidence, of the rent of every barony, was a rule for levying the King's ca&s;ualties as &s;uperior, without nece&s;&s;ity of demanding other evi|dence. But domes-day book could not long an&s;wer this purpo&s;e; for when great baronies were di&s;membered, each part to be held of the crown, this book afforded no rule for the extent of the ca&s;ualties to to be levied out of the lands of the new va&s;&s;als. An inqui&s;ition therefore was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to a&s;certain the yearly rents of the disjoined parcels; and there could not be a more proper time for &s;uch enquiry than when the heir of a crown va&s;&s;al was &s;uing out his livery. This &s;eems to be a rea&s;onable mo|tive for ingro&s;&s;ing the foregoing que&s;tion in the brieve. And in England, this enquiry was nece&s;&s;ary upon a &s;pecial account. It was not the cu&s;tom there to give gifts of the ca&s;ualties of &s;uperiority. Officers were appointed in every &s;hire to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="189" REF="186">
in name of the King of the lands of his de|cea&s;ed va&s;&s;als, and to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till the heirs were entered. The&s;e officers, called e&s;cheators, were accountable to the crown for the rents and i&s;&s;ues, and for the other ca&s;ualties; and the rent of the land a&s;certained by the retour was the rule to the trea&s;urer for counting with e&s;cheators.</P>
<P>WE find not different values or extents in the Engli&s;h brieve, like what we find in the Scotch brieve. I &s;hall endeavour to trace the occa&s;ion of the difference, after premi&s;ing a &s;hort hi&s;tory of our taxes; car|rying the matter as far back as we have evidence.</P>
<P>TAXES were no part of the con&s;titution of any feudal government. The King was &s;upported by the rents of his property-lands, and by the occa&s;ional profits of &s;uperiority, pa&s;&s;ing under the name of ca&s;ualties. The&s;e ca&s;ualties, &s;uch as ward, nonentry, mar|riage, e&s;cheat, &amp;c. aro&s;e from the very na|ture
<PB N="190" REF="187">

For this rea&s;on, it is natural to conjecture, that the fir&s;t univer&s;al tax was impo&s;ed upon &s;ome &s;uch &s;ingular occa&s;ion. The fir&s;t event we can di&s;cover in the hi&s;tory of Scotland to make &s;uch a tax nece&s;&s;ary, happened in the reign of William the Lyon.

<P>RICHARD I. who &s;ucceeded Henry, bent upon a voyage to the holy land, &s;tood in need of great &s;ums for the expedition.

<P>THE &s;um paid to King Richard upon this occa&s;ion was too great to be rai&s;ed by the King of Scotland out of his own domains. It mu&s;t have been levied by a

The monks of the Ci&s;tertian order having contributed a &s;hare, obtained from King William a deed, declaring, That this con|tribution &s;hould not be made a precedent in time coming<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix to Ander&s;on's e&s;&s;ay on the independency of Scotland, N^o. 21.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ne quod in tali eventu &s;emel factum e&s;t, qui nec prius evenit, nec in po&s;terum Deo mi&s;erante futurus e&s;t, ullo modo in con&s;uetu|dinem vel &s;ervitutem convertatur; ut videlicit per quod ip&s;i, pro redimenda regni libertate gratis fecerunt, &s;ervitus iis imponatur."</Q> This, in all probability was the fir&s;t tax of any importance that was levied in Scotland; and though our hi&s;torians are altogether &s;ilent as to the manner, the deed now mentioned proves it to have been levied by voluntary con|tribution,

<P>THE next tax we meet with, is in the days of Alexander II. &s;on to the above men|tioned William. This King made a journey the length of Dover, and his ready money being exhau&s;ted, he procured a &s;um by pledg|ing &s;ome lands, to redeem which he levied a tax.

<P>ALEXANDER III. married Margaret, daughter to Henry III. of England, and was in perfect good under&s;tanding with that kingdom during his whole reign. He was but once obliged to take up arms, and the occa&s;ion was, to re&s;i&s;t an inva&s;ion by Acho king of Norway, who landed at Ayr,
<PB N="194" REF="191">
Augu&s;t 1263; nor was this war of any con|tinuance. Acho was defeated on land, and his fleet &s;uffered by a &s;torm, which obliged him to retire not many months after his landing. Alexander, &s;ome years thereafter, <HI>viz.</HI> 25th July 1281<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. II. p. 1079.</NOTE>, contracted his daugh|ter Margaret to Eric the young king of Norway, and bound him&s;elf for a tocher of 14000 merks Sterling; a fourth part to be in&s;tantly advanced; a fourth part to be paid 1&s;t Augu&s;t 1282, a fourth part 1&s;t Au|gu&s;t 1283, and the remaining fourth 1&s;t Au|gu&s;t 1284; but providing an option to give land for the two latter &s;hares, at the rate of 100 merks of rent for 1000 merks of money.</P>
<P>THIS &s;um, which Alexander contracted in name of portion with his daughter, amounted to about 28000<HI>l.</HI> Sterling of our pre&s;ent money<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ruddiman's preface to An|der&s;on's Diplomata Scotiae.</NOTE>; too great a &s;um to be rai&s;ed out of his own funds: and as by law he was
<PB N="195" REF="192">
intitled to demand aid from his va&s;&s;als upon this occa&s;ion, there can be little doubt that the &s;um was levied by &s;ome &s;ort of tax or contribution. He had recent authority for laying this burden upon his &s;ubjects, <HI>viz.</HI> that of his father-in-law Henry III.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spelman's Glo&s;&s;ary, (voce) Auxilium.</NOTE>; and if his &s;ubjects were to be burdened equally, it was nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain the value of the whole lands in the kingdom.

<PB N="196" REF="193">
an undertaking &s;o laborious other than levy|ing the &s;aid &s;um.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER III. left no de&s;cendants but a grand-daughter, commonly called the Maid of Norway; and &s;he having died unmarried and under age, Scotland was mi&s;erably harra&s;&s;ed by Edward I. of Eng|land, who laid hold of the opportunity of a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to en&s;lave this king|dom. Robert Bruce, by unwearied oppo|&s;ition, got peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown, <HI>anno</HI> 1306, and though he &s;eized upon the lands belonging to Baliol and the Cum|mins, and made con&s;iderable profit by le&s;|&s;ening the weight of money in the re-coin|age, yet, by a long train of war and inte|&s;tine commotions, the crown-lands were &s;o wa&s;ted, that, towards the end of his reign, it became nece&s;&s;ary for him to petition the parliament for a &s;upply. Upon the 15th July 1326, the parliament being conveened at Cambu&s;kenneth, the laity agreed to give him during his life the tenth penny of all

<P>HERE is compleat proof of a valuation in the reign of Alexander III. named in the indenture, the <HI>Old Extent.</HI> And as the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e affords real evidence that the tax was levied, we have no rea|&s;on to doubt, that every man who&s;e rents had fallen by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of war, took the benefit of the foregoing clau&s;e, to get his lands revalued by the &s;heriff, that he
<PB N="198" REF="195">
might pay no more than a ju&s;t proportion of the tax.</P>
<P>WE have now materials &s;ufficient for an explanation of the <HI>valent</HI> clau&s;e in our re|tours. At what time it came into practice, is altogether uncertain. If this clau&s;e was not made a part of the brieve of inque&s;t before the days of Alexander III. there was little occa&s;ion for it, after the extent made in that reign, till the great baronies were &s;plit into parts, and the King's va&s;&s;als were multiplied. One thing we may rely on as certain, that before the 1326, when the &s;aid indenture pa&s;&s;ed between King Ro|bert and his parliament, one extent only was mentioned in retours, <HI>viz.</HI> that of Alexander III. Nor before that period was there any occa&s;ion for a double ex|tent here more than in England. Of this I reckon we may be convinced by what follows. In levying the ca&s;ualties of &s;u|periority, &s;uch as ward, nonentry, &amp;c. it was not the genius of this country, to
<PB N="199" REF="196">
&s;tretch &s;uch claims to the utmo&s;t, by &s;tat|ing the ju&s;t and true rent of the land upon every occa&s;ion. Such a fluctuating e&s;tima|tion, &s;evere upon va&s;&s;als, would at the &s;ame time have been trouble&s;ome to &s;uperiors. The King, and, in imitation of him, other &s;uperiors were &s;atisfied with a con&s;tant fixed rent to be a general rule for a&s;cer|taining the ca&s;ualties, without regarding any occa&s;ional increa&s;e or diminution of rent. The extent in the reign of Alex|ander III. was probably the full rent, and mu&s;t have continued a pretty ju&s;t valua|tion for many years. This extent then be|came the univer&s;al mea&s;ure of the ca&s;ualties of &s;uperiority. If a barony remained en|tire as in the days of Alexander III. there was no occa&s;ion for witne&s;&s;es to prove the rent: it was found in the rolls containing the old extent. If a barony was &s;plit into parts, the rent of the &s;everal par|cels was found in the retours, being a pro|portion of the old extent of the whole. Hence this <HI>quaere</HI> in the brieve, <HI>Quantum</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="197">
<HI>valent dictae terrae per annum,</HI> came to have a fixed and determined meaning; not what the&s;e lands are worth of yearly rent at pre|&s;ent, but what they were worth at the la&s;t general valuation; or, in other words, what they are computed to in the rolls contain|ing the old extent.</P>
<P>THUS the matter &s;tood, and behoved to &s;tand, at the date of the indenture 1326, which laid a foundation for a re-valuation, not of the whole lands in Scotland, but only of what were wa&s;ted by war. Suppo&s;ing now &s;uch a re-valuation, of which we can entertain no rea&s;onable doubt when it was in favour of va&s;&s;als, it behoved to be the rule, not only for levying the tax then impo&s;ed, but al&s;o for a&s;certaining the ca|&s;ualties of &s;uperiority. If &s;o, it was nece&s;|&s;ary to take notice of this new valuation in the retours of the&s;e lands, and con&s;e|quently in the brieve, which was the war|rant of the retour. The clau&s;e, <HI>quantum valent,</HI> contained in the brieve, could not
<PB N="201" REF="198">
an&s;wer this purpo&s;e, becau&s;e that clau&s;e re|garded only the old extent, and was a que|&s;tion to which the old valuation of the land was the proper an&s;wer. A new clau&s;e there|fore was nece&s;&s;ary, and the clau&s;e that was added, points out &s;o preci&s;ely the re-va|luation authorized by this indenture, as to afford real evidence, that the clau&s;e mu&s;t have been contrived &s;oon after it. The clau&s;e as altered runs thus: <HI>Et quantum nunc valent dictae terrae, et quantum valuerunt tempore pacis.</HI> It was extremely natural to characterize the old extent by the phra&s;e <HI>tempore pacis,</HI> not only as made in a peace|able reign, but al&s;o in oppo&s;ition to the new extent occa&s;ioned by the deva&s;tation of war. I need only further remark, that this new clau&s;e behoved to be ingro&s;&s;ed in every brieve; becau&s;e, with re&s;pect to any particular land-e&s;tate, it could not be|forehand be known, whether it had been wa&s;ted by war or not.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="199">
BUT, be&s;ides conjecture, there are facts which will put this matter beyond contro|ver&s;y. I have not hitherto di&s;covered a retour of land held of the King, &s;o ancient as the 1326; but of that period there are pre&s;erved authentick copies of many retours of lands held of bi&s;hops, mona&s;teries, &amp;c. who had the privilege of a chancery. And we have no rea&s;on to doubt, that the great barons who had this privilege, were ambi|tious of copying after the King's chancery in every article. The fir&s;t retour I &s;hall mention, happens to be a very lucky au|thority; for it verifies a fact which I have mentioned above upon the faith of conjec|ture, that at the date of the indenture 1326, there was but one extent mentioned in the brieve and retour. The retour I ap|peal to, is that of the land of Orroc in the county of Fife, held of the abbay of Dun|fermline, dated the 20th May 1328, the <HI>valent</HI> clau&s;e of which runs thus: <HI>Item dicunt quod praedictae terrae de Orroc valent per annum</HI> 12<HI>l.</HI> This retour at the &s;ame
<PB N="203" REF="200">
time &s;hows, that the alteration in the <HI>va|lent</HI> clau&s;e was not then introduced, which is not wonderful, when the retour is but a year and ten months after the inden|ture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SINCE writing what is above, I have &s;een a copy, not, properly &s;peaking, of a retour, but of a valuation of the lands of Kilravock and Ea&s;ter-Gedies, <HI>anno</HI> 1295, in which the <HI>valent</HI> clau&s;e runs thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Quod terra de Kilravock cum omnibus pertinentiis &s;uis, &s;ciz. cum molendinis bra|cinis quarellis et bo&s;co valet per annum 24 lib. item dixerunt quod terra de Ea&s;ter-Gedies cum molendino et bracinis valet per annum 12 lib."</Q></NOTE>. The mo&s;t ancient retour I have &s;een after that now mentioned, bears date in the 1359, being of land held of the &s;ame abbay. Before this time, probably &s;everal years, the alteration of the <HI>valent</HI> clau&s;e was made; for in this retour it runs thus: <HI>Et dictae terrae valebant tempore bonae pacis L.</HI> 13: 6: 8. <HI>et nunc valent L.</HI> 10: 13: 7. There are in that period many other re|tours mentioning two extents, di&s;tingui&s;h|ing them in the &s;ame manner.

<PB N="204" REF="201">
new extent authorized by the &s;aid inden|ture. Some retours indeed there are of that period, where the <HI>valuerunt tempore pacis</HI> and the <HI>nunc valent</HI> are the &s;ame. But it is ea&s;y to account for that circum|&s;tance: becau&s;e from the indenture it ap|pears, that but a part of our lands were wa&s;ted by war; and the retours now men|tioned mu&s;t be of lands which were not &s;o wa&s;ted.</P>
<P>DOWN to the days of our James I. I take it to be certain, that the two extents men|tioned in retours, were the&s;e of Alexan|der III. and Robert Bruce. In James's reign we ob&s;erve an alteration, which can|not be explained without going on with the hi&s;tory of the publick taxes. The next tax that de&s;erves to be taken notice of, was in the reign of David II. This King was taken pri&s;oner by the Engli&s;h at the battle of Durham <HI>anno</HI> 1346, and was relea&s;ed <HI>anno</HI> 1365; after agreeing to pay for his ran&s;om 100,000<HI>l.</HI> Sterling within
<PB N="205" REF="202">
the &s;pace of twenty five years. And there is good evidence that the whole was paid before the year 1383<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. VI. p. 464. vol. VII. p. 417.</NOTE>. This immen&s;e debt, contracted for redeeming the King from captivity, came to be a burden upon his va&s;&s;als, by the very con&s;titution of the feudal law, ab&s;tracting from the authority of parliament. It mu&s;t therefore have been levied as a publick tax, which appears to be the ca&s;e from the rolls of that King &s;till extant in exchequer. And as there is no ve&s;tige of any new valuation at this time, the old extent, <HI>viz.</HI> that of Alexander III. mu&s;t have been the rule; except &s;o far as it was altered by the partial valuation in the reign of Robert I. And what puts this pa&s;t doubt is, that the new extent conti|nued to be lower than the old extent, or extent <HI>tempore pacis,</HI> during this King's reign, and until the reign of James I.</P>
<P>JAMES I. having been many years de|tained in England, obtained his liberty
<PB N="206" REF="203">
upon giving ho&s;tages for payment of 40,000<HI>l.</HI> Sterling, demanded under the &s;pecious title of alimony. Of this &s;um 10,000<HI>l.</HI> was remitted by Henry VI. at that time King of England, upon James's marrying a daughter of the duke of So|mer&s;et. In the parliament 1424, provi&s;ion was made for redeeming the ho&s;tages by a &s;ub&s;idy granted of the twentieth part of lands, moveables, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black acts, p. 1624, C. 10, 11.</NOTE> In order to levy this tax, a valuation was directed of lands as well as of moveables. And this new va|luation of lands became proper, if not ne|ce&s;&s;ary, upon the following account, that the rea&s;on for making the new extent in the 1326 no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. The lands which at that time had been wa&s;ted by war, were now re&s;tored to their wonted value; and yet without a new valuation, the&s;e lands could only be taxed according to the extent 1326. And with this &s;pecial rea&s;on concurred one more general, which is, than an extent, if the commerce of
<PB N="207" REF="204">
land be free, cannot long be a rule for levying publick taxes. For by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, purcha&s;e, and other means of acquiring property, parcels of land are united into a a whole, or a whole &s;plit into parcels, which acquire new names, till, by cour&s;e of time, it comes to be a matter of uncertainty, what lands are meant by the original name pre&s;erved upon record. This rea&s;on &s;hows the nece&s;&s;ity of new extents from time to time; for after the connection betwixt land and the name it bears in the extent rolls is lo&s;t, the&s;e rolls can no longer be of u&s;e for proportioning a tax upon &s;uch land.</P>
<P>IT was appointed by the act impo&s;ing the &s;ub&s;idy, that this extent &s;hould be made and put in books, betwixt and the 13th July then next; and that it was made, and al&s;o that the &s;ub&s;idy was levied, appears from the continuator of Fordon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L. 16. cap. 9.</NOTE>. He reports, that it amounted the fir&s;t year
<PB N="208" REF="205">
to 14000 merks, that the &s;econd year it was much le&s;s, and the people beginning to murmur, that the tax was no longer continued. But we have &s;till a better au|thority than the continuator of Fordon, to prove that the extent was made, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;e|veral retours recently after the 1424, where the new extent is uniformly greater than the old extent, or extent <HI>tempore pacis.</HI> The&s;e mu&s;t refer to &s;ome late extent, and not to the extent 1326, which behoved to be le&s;s than the old extent. Of the&s;e re|tours the mo&s;t ancient I have met with is dated 1431, being of the lands of Blair|mukis, held of the Baron of Bothvill, in which James de Dundas is retoured heir to James de Dundas his father, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Qui ju|rati dicunt quod dictae terrae nunc valent per annum 20 mercas, et valuerunt tem|pore pacis 100 &s;olidos<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N.B. THIS retour is in the hands of Sir John Inglis of Cramond.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>SINCE there was a new extent of the whole lands of Scotland, which mu&s;t have
<PB N="209" REF="206">
been the rule for levying the ca&s;ualties of &s;uperiority, as well as the tax then im|po&s;ed, one is naturally led to enquire, what was the u&s;e of continuing in the brieve of inque&s;t the <HI>quoere</HI> about the two different extents? why not return to the ancient form &s;pecifying one extent only, <HI>viz.</HI> the pre&s;ent extent? In an&s;wer to this, it mu&s;t be yielded, that there could ly no objection to this innovation had it been intended. But by this time the rule had prevailed of pre|&s;erving inviolably the &s;tile of judicial writs; and as to que&s;tions &s;o ea&s;y to be an&s;wered, the innovation probably was reckoned a matter of no &s;uch importance, as to occa|&s;ion an alteration in the &s;tile of the brieve of inque&s;t. One thing is certain, that the &s;tile remains the &s;ame without any altera|tion &s;ince the days of King Robert I. The brieve and retour obtained however a dif|ferent meaning; &s;o far as that the <HI>nunc valent,</HI> by which formerly was meant the extent 1326, came afterwards to mean the extent 1424. For in&s;tance, the retour
<PB N="210" REF="207">
of the lands of Tullach, held of the abbey of Aberbrothick, bearing date 1438, has the <HI>valent</HI> clau&s;e thus: <HI>Valent per annum L.</HI> 33: 6: 8, <HI>et tempore pacis valuerunt L.</HI> 10. Another in&s;tance is a retour of the lands of Forglen, held of the &s;ame abbey, dated 1457, <HI>Valent nunc per annum</HI> 20 <HI>merks, et valuerunt tempore pacis L.</HI> 10. That by the <HI>nunc valent</HI> in the&s;e two retours mu&s;t be meant the late extent of James I. is evident from the following circum&s;tance, that in|&s;tead of being le&s;s than the extent <HI>tempore pacis,</HI> which the extent 1326 con&s;tantly was, it is con&s;iderably greater.</P>
<P>As the extent 1424 was uniformly in|gro&s;&s;ed in every retour, in an&s;wer to the <HI>quantum nunc valent</HI> in the brieve, this prac|tice came to be exceeding favourable to va&s;&s;als in counting for the ca&s;ualties due by them; becau&s;e in every &s;uch account this extent was taken for the true rent of the land. By the gradual &s;inking of the value of money and the improvement of
<PB N="211" REF="208">
land, the benefit which va&s;&s;als had by this form of &s;tating accounts, came to be too con&s;iderable to be overlooked. The value of the King's ca&s;ualties by this means gra|dually dimini&s;hing, the matter was taken under con&s;ideration by the legi&s;lature, and produced the act 55. p. 1474, ordaining, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it be an&s;wered in the retour, of what avail the land was of old, and the very avail that it is worth and gives, the day of &s;erving the brieve."</Q></P>
<P>I formerly inclined to think, that it was not the meaning of this &s;tatute, to require a new proof of the rent of land every time it was retoured upon a brieve of inque&s;t. I &s;u&s;pected that there had been &s;ome new general valuation of the lands in Scotland recently before the &s;tatute, and that the &s;tatute referred to this valuation. And I was encouraged to embrace this opinion, by finding in the records of parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1467, acts 74, 79, 86.</NOTE>, a tax impo&s;ed of <HI>L.</HI> 3000, for defraying
<PB N="212" REF="209">
the expence of an emba&s;&s;y to Denmark, and a general valuation appointed in order to levy that tax. Commi&s;&s;ioners are named to take the proof, and certain per&s;ons ap|pointed, one out of each e&s;tate, to receive the &s;ums that &s;hould be levied. And that this mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e, appeared pro|bable, upon finding, that the new extent, even after this period, was not le&s;s uniform than formerly, and therefore that it could not corre&s;pond to the true rent of land, which all the world know is in a continual fluctuation. But if after all there en&s;ued no new valuation of the land-rent of this kingdom, of which there is not the &s;lighte&s;t ve&s;tige, the &s;tatute mu&s;t be taken in its literal meaning, becau&s;e it can admit of none other. I have &s;till better authority for adhering to the literal meaning of this &s;tatute, <HI>viz.</HI> the proceedings of the &s;ove|reign court, while the &s;tatute was fre&s;h in memory. The Earl of Bothwell, donator to the relief and nonentry of the barony of Balinbreich, brought a reduction again&s;t
<PB N="213" REF="210">
the Earl of Rothes proprietor, of his re|tour of that barony upon this medium, that they were retoured to 200 merks only for the new extent, though the rent really amounted to a much greater &s;um. It was proved before the court, that the barony paid 500 merks of rent; and up|on this medium the retour was reduced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">22d October 1489.</NOTE>. And the like was done with re&s;pect to the retour of the lands of Shield and Drongan, which were retoured to <HI>L.</HI> 42 of new ex|tent, and yet were proved by witne&s;&s;es to be 100 merks of yearly rent<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">13th February 1499, The King <HI>contra</HI> Crawford.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the retours accordingly, that bear date recently after the &s;tatute, we find a &s;udden &s;tart of the new extent, and a much greater di&s;proportion than formerly betwixt it and the old extent. In the chartulary of the abbey of Aberbrothick, there is a copy of a retour of certain lands, dated <HI>anno</HI> 1491, the particulars of which are, <HI>Terrae de Pittarrow</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="211">

I have had occa&s;ion to mention a retour of the lands of Forglen, held of the abbey of Aberbrothick, dated <HI>anno</HI> 1457, of which the new extent is 20 merks, and the old extent is <HI>L.</HI> 10. In the &s;ame chartu|lary, there is luckily another retour of the &s;ame lands, bearing date <HI>anno</HI> 1494, of which the <HI>valent</HI> clau&s;e is in the following words, <HI>Valent nunc L.</HI> 20. <HI>et valuerunt tem|pore pacis</HI> 20 <HI>merks.</HI> The difference in &s;o &s;hort a time as 37 years betwixt 20 merks and <HI>L.</HI> 20 of new extent, is real evidence, that the act of parliament was duly ob&s;erv|ed in making out the retour la&s;t-mentioned. But from the compari&s;on of the&s;e two re|tours, a more curious ob&s;ervation occurs,
<PB N="215" REF="212">
<HI>viz.</HI> that retours of lands held of &s;ubject-&s;uperiors, are not much to be relied on as evidence of the old extent. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e retours the old extent is &s;tated at <HI>L.</HI> 10, in the other at 20 merks; occa&s;ion|ed by a blunder of the inque&s;t, who in|gro&s;&s;ed as the old extent in the retour they were forming, the new extent contained in the former retour. Many &s;uch blunders would probably be di&s;covered, had we a full record of old retours. And it need not be &s;urpri&s;ing, that in &s;uch retours little at|tention was given to the <HI>valent</HI> clau&s;e, which was reckoned a matter merely of form. For though the publick taxes were levied from the King's va&s;&s;als according to the old extent, yet in proportioning the relief which a Baron had again&s;t his own va&s;&s;als, there is little doubt that the true rent was made the rule. The new extent was of more con&s;equence, becau&s;e it was the rule for the nonentry duties, before a declarator of nonentry was rai&s;ed by a Baron again&s;t the heir of his va&s;&s;al.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="213">
IT may be remarked here by the by, that the act 1474 is real evidence of a flou|ri&s;hing &s;tate of affairs after our James I. got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his throne. From the valuation 1424 to the &s;aid act, there pa&s;&s;ed but fifty years; and the land rent of Scot|land mu&s;t have increa&s;ed remarkably du|ring that period, to make the act 1474 ne|ce&s;&s;ary. But that Monarch in his younger years was di&s;ciplined in the &s;chool of ad|ver&s;ity. During a tedious confinement of eighteen years, he had &s;ufficient lei&s;ure to &s;tudy the arts of government; and proba|bly he made the be&s;t u&s;e of his time. It is certain, that before his reign we had no ex|perience and &s;carce any notion of a regu|lar government, where the law bears &s;way, and the people peaceably &s;ubmit to the au|thority of law. But to return to our &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>AS by the &s;tatute now mentioned, the &s;uperior's ca&s;ualties were rai&s;ed to their highe&s;t pitch, it was impracticable to &s;up|port
<PB N="217" REF="214">
them long at that height, in oppo&s;i|tion to the general bias of the nation in favour of Va&s;&s;als. The notion had been long ago broatched, and was now firmly e|&s;tabli&s;hed, that the va&s;&s;al was proprietor, and con&s;equently that ward, relief, and nonentry were rigorous and &s;evere ca&s;ual|ties. We have Spot&s;wood's authority, in his hi&s;tory of the church of Scotland, that loud complaints were made again&s;t the&s;e ca&s;ualties early in the reign of James IV. But why at this period in particular, for we do not find the &s;ame complaints after|wards; at lea&s;t they make no figure in the annals of more recent times? The act we have been di&s;cour&s;ing about affords a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. The&s;e ca&s;ualties, in con&s;equence of the &s;tatute, were more ri|gorou&s;ly exacted than formerly. And we &s;hall now proceed to &s;how, that they were very &s;oon brought down to a moderate pitch, notwith&s;tanding the &s;tatute. In &s;erving a brieve of inque&s;t, it is certain the practice did not long continue, of taking a
<PB N="218" REF="215">
proof by witne&s;&s;es of the true rent of the land. The old method was revived, of making a former extent the rule. If the land was once retoured as pre&s;cribed by the &s;tatute, the old and new extent in|gro&s;&s;ed in that retour were continued in the following retours. If there was no re|tour, a proportion of the old and new ex|tent of the whole barony was taken. And where that was not to be had, it was the method, to ingro&s;s a new extent bearing a certain proportion to the old extent. For the la&s;t we have Skene's authority (<HI>voce</HI> Extent). His words are: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion e&s;teem a merk-land of old ex|tent to four merk-land of new extent."</Q> And he cites a deci&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> 21&s;t March 1541, Kennedy <HI>contra</HI> Mackinnald, which &s;eems to import &s;o much; though but ob&s;curely, becau&s;e the ca&s;e is not di&s;tinctly &s;tated. The proce&s;s being for the non|entry duties of a five merk-land, it is &s;aid to have been proved, that the land payed of rent four merks for every one of the
<PB N="219" REF="216">
&s;aid five merks; and I mu&s;t acknowledge, that the manner of expre&s;&s;ion &s;eems to point at &s;ome general rule, rather than at a proof by witne&s;&s;es. If this be the mean|ing of the deci&s;ion, it is the fir&s;t ca&s;e I have ob&s;erved, where this deviation from the &s;tatute was authorized by the &s;ove|reign court; and a notable deviation it was, to take up with &s;uch an imaginary rule for a&s;certaining the rent of the land, when the &s;tatute directed a proof by wit|ne&s;&s;es of the true rent. But when the act came once to be neglected, the court was more explicit in their judgments on this point. In a ca&s;e ob&s;erved by Balfour, (Title of Brieves and Retours) 17th July 1562, Queen's Advocate and Lord Drum|mond <HI>contra</HI> George Mu&s;het, a general rule is e&s;tabli&s;hed directly in face of the &s;tatute; which is, that when lands pay farm-victual, poultry, &amp;c. the inque&s;t are not bound to take inqui&s;ition of the year|ly rent, nor to convert &s;uch ca&s;ualties in|to money. And the rea&s;on given is re|markable,
<PB N="220" REF="217">
<HI>viz.</HI> that the price of &s;uch ca|&s;ualties is &s;o changeable that no certain or fixed &s;um can be a&s;certained. This is a very bad rea&s;on upon the plan of the &s;ta|tute, though it &s;erves to &s;how the &s;en&s;e of the nation, which the &s;tatute had not era|dicated, that the new extent ought to be fixed and uniform as well as the old. At the &s;ame time, as the land-rent in Scotland was generally paid in victual, this deci&s;ion was in effect a repeal of the &s;tatute; of which we need not doubt, that the pro|prietors, who&s;e rents were paid in money, would take advantage. And the act 1474 came in this manner to be &s;o univer&s;al|ly neglected, that it was e&s;tabli&s;hed as a matter of right, that the new extent &s;hould always be lower than the true rent; and for this we have the be&s;t authority. The act 6. p. 1584 impowering the King to feu out his annexed property, has the follow|ing clau&s;e. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Providing always that the &s;aidis infeftments of feuferme be not maid within the ju&s;t avail, to the pre|judice
<PB N="221" REF="218">
and hurt of our &s;overeign Lord and his &s;ucce&s;&s;oures: That is to &s;ay, within the dewtie to the quilkis the &s;aidis landis are retoured, or may be ju&s;t|ly retoured, for the new extent.
