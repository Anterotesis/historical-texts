<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH it is near &s;even years &s;ince the Author of this Pamphlet left this vale of tears, yet, when we peru&s;e its contents, it may with &s;ome propriety be &s;aid, that <HI>although he be dead, he yet &s;peaketh.</HI> His experience (with re&s;pect to trials and deliverances) was, in many in&s;tances, very &s;ingular, as will appear in the following pages. As it mu&s;t be allowed, that great advantages have been derived from reading, and relating the dealings of God with his people (both in a way of providence and grace) I think our <HI>decea&s;ed friend's te&s;timony</HI> &s;hould not be withheld from the Chri&s;tian Reader. The practice, in different ages of the Church, has been to recite the experience of the people of God. Hence we read, that David, who had experienced many deliverances from his enemies (both in a temporal and &s;piritual manner) cries out, "O! come hither, all ye that fear the Lord, and I will tell you what he hath done for my &s;oul." We read al&s;o in the pro|phet Malachi, that "They who feared the Lord, &s;pake oftentimes one to another; and <HI>a book of re|membrance
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
was written.</HI>" The apo&s;tle Paul al&s;o ob&s;erves, that we &s;hould "Exhort and encourage one another &s;o much the more, as we &s;ee the day approach|ing." Thus much is ob&s;erved by way of apology for the publication of Mr. Told's life. Suffice it then o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly to &s;ay, the Author was one of the Rev. Mr. We&s;ley's preachers, and that his outward con|duct corre&s;ponded with his profe&s;&s;ion. He was (for a number of years) eminent in vi&s;iting the unhappy pri&s;oners, both in Newgate and other gaols, where his mini&s;try was made very u&s;eful.&mdash;I was acquainted with Mr. Told &s;ome years before his death, and believe he was a man of integrity; therefore can with greater propriety recommend the following Pamphlet to the candid and Chri&s;tian Reader.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE, and DEALINGS of GOD WITH SILAS TOLD, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born at the Lime-kilns, near the hot-wells, in the city of Bri&s;tol, on the 3d day of April, 1711. My parents, both on the father and mother's &s;ide, were very creditable people. My grandfather Told, who was an eminent phy&s;ician at London, lived in Bunhill-Row, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very plentiful e&s;tate in hou&s;es: My grandmother al&s;o enjoyed a very con&s;iderable fortune, at Torrington, in the we&s;t of Eng|land, worth about &pound;600 per annum; but having a great di&s;like to London, and her hu&s;band's bu&s;ine&s;s fixing him there, cau&s;ed &s;o far a &s;eparation between them, that they and their po&s;terity experienced very fatal con&s;equences therefrom, as he took to him a hou&s;e|keeper, who, as I was informed by my mother, when &s;he found a fair opportunity, gave him what proved his end, and &s;ecured all his writings, and the title-deeds
<PB N="2" REF="5">
of the e&s;tate, together with all the ready-money, plate, jewels, &amp;c. the family being ab&s;ent from Lon|don! And although &s;he could not hold the e&s;tate, &amp;c. yet, for a great number of years, and even to this day, &s;everal people have lived rent free, for want of proper title-deeds to empower the heir to receive the &s;ame; to that when I fir&s;t came to London, after faithfully &s;erving my time to Capt. Mo&s;es Lilly, of Bri&s;tol, to the &s;eas, they had commenced the building of a few hou&s;es in the front of Bunhill-Row, on the left-hand &s;ide going up out of Chi&s;well-Street; but hearing that one of Dr. Told's grandchildren was come to London, they proceeded no farther than covering them in, and in that condition they remained for the &s;pace of twenty years before they were fini&s;hed, the tenants, all of them, &s;till living rent free. I was frequently advi&s;ed to make a claim to the e&s;tate; out for want of money to go to law, together with the lo&s;s of the writings, I utterly declined it; &s;o that I had given up all hopes of ever being profited thereby: And as to my grandmother Told's e&s;tate, in the we&s;t, this never came within my knowledge.</P>
<P>I now come to the account of my father, who was a phy&s;ician at Bri&s;tol, and in great e&s;teem throughout that city; but being a great &s;chemer, it proved his ruin, and the impoveri&s;hing of all his family, parti|cularly in one in&s;tance, of building a wet dock at the Lime-kilns, where I was born; he laid out thirty-three hundred pounds, and lo&s;t every penny by one Evans, for whom my father undertook the bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="3" REF="6">
who failed, and went off: This laid my father under the nece&s;&s;ity of going out doctor of a Guineaman, in the cour&s;e of which voyage he died, and was buried at King&s;ton in Jamaica, leaving only &s;ix hundred pounds for the maintenance and education of five children. I would here ob&s;erve, that during this voyage I was informed he cleared the &s;um of &pound;800, which Capt. Celliwood wronged our family of.</P>
<P>My mother was born at Top&s;ham, near Exeter, and was daughter to Capt. Thomas Suckabitch, otherwi&s;e Suck&s;bury, who commanded a &s;hip upwards of forty years. Something remarkable is related of my mo|ther's pedigree, viz. In tracing them up to the farthe&s;t knowledge, it has been repre&s;ented, that in the time of the Kings of the We&s;t Angles, his Maje&s;ty being out on a certain day hunting with his Nobles, di&s;cover|ed a male child in the wood, with no one near it but a large bitch, the maid having left the child with the bitch whil&s;t &s;he went a nutting in the woods. The King, who found the child &s;ucking the bitch, carried it home, named it Suckabitch, and brought him up, giving him a large e&s;tate round the &s;pot where he was found, which the &s;ucceeding generations have &s;eve|rally enjoyed to this day, but altered the name to that of Suck&s;bury.</P>
<P>My uncle (Thomas Suck&s;bury) married the daughter of &mdash; Lloyd, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> on St. James's Back, with above &pound;100,000 fortune, but &s;he being deformed, he went to &s;ea again, being captain of a very large &s;hip for many years. It was &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;hip foundered in the Atlantic, as &s;he was never heard of.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">My brother Jo&s;eph, and &s;i&s;ter Dulcy, with my&s;elf, were &s;ent to nur&s;e at King's-Wood, near Bri&s;tol, where we were taken the utmo&s;t care of by the mo&s;t tender-hearted woman I ever met with. At this place we all con|tinued till I arrived at the age of eight years; my friends, at Bri&s;tol, then made intere&s;t for one of us two boys to be admitted into the ho&s;pital of Edward Col|&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> on St. Augu&s;tin's Back, near the Quay of Bri&s;tol; a &s;chool, I dare venture to &s;ay, that cannot be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by any throughout Great-Britain for piety and Chri&s;tian di&s;cipline, having a mini&s;ter to attend twice a week regularly, for the in&s;truction of one hun|dred boys in their duty towards God and man. Here, I think, it may not be improper to give an exact and impartial account of the character and piety of &s;o wor|thy a benefactor; and al&s;o of the wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s of Almighty God in rai&s;ing up &s;o &s;teady and u&s;eful a man to po&s;terity. I &s;hall trace this man of God from his birth: He was the &s;on of Edward Col|&s;on, a journeyman &s;oap-boiler, who&s;e wages did not exceed ten &s;hillings per week, and had ten children then living, of whom Edward was the elde&s;t, who, when he had arrived to an age fit to be put out an ap|prentice, his father bound him to a Virginia cap|tain, about the time that the coloni&s;ts were tran&s;ported to North-America, in order to inhabit tho&s;e parts. This proved his fir&s;t ri&s;e, as his behaviour, and hum|ble readine&s;s to obey his &s;uperiors, moved many of the merchants, who fir&s;t &s;ettled there, to make Edward, the cabin-boy, many pre&s;ents, in&s;omuch that, before
<PB N="5" REF="8">
his &s;hip departed from America for England, he had acquired the &s;um of fifty pounds; and, being of an exceeding liberal di&s;po&s;ition, on his arrival at Bri&s;tol, he ha&s;tened with the &pound;50, and di&s;pen&s;ed every farthing there|of to the pri&s;oners at Newgate; and &s;hortly after &s;ailed again to Virginia, where he, through the kind pro|vidence of God, gathered, among his former friends, twice the money of the preceding voyage, and di&s;po&s;ed of the whole after the &s;ame manner. Here I mu&s;t di&s;continue the relation of his proceedings, knowing no more of them, 'till he arrived at the age of forty years, when, as I have been informed, he became a very eminent Ea&s;t-India merchant, prior to the in|corporation of the Ea&s;t-India company, and had forty &s;ail of &s;hips of his own, with immen&s;e riches flowing in upon him; yet, notwith&s;tanding, he remained &s;teady and uniform in his charitable di&s;po&s;ition, di|&s;tributing many thou&s;and pounds to various charities in and about London, as al&s;o private gifts to many parts of the kingdom; and in the year 1708 he in|&s;tituted a very magnificent &s;chool on St. Augu&s;tine's Back, Bri&s;tol, which, as I have been informed, co&s;t him 11,000 pounds in the building, and endowed the &s;ame with between 17 and 1800 pounds per an|num, freehold for ever; likewi&s;e ten pounds for ap|prenticing every boy, and, for twelve years after his death, ten pounds to put them into bu&s;ine&s;s: He like|wi&s;e maintained religious oeconomy in the &s;chool, &s;uch as prayers three times a day, performed by one of
<PB N="6" REF="9">
the &s;uperior boys. He al&s;o cau&s;ed to be erected a very grand free &s;tone alms-hou&s;e, with an elegant chapel &s;ituated in the front thereof, on St. Michael's-Hill, Bri&s;tol, for 24 old men, with a hand&s;ome allowance for every individual, and a clergyman to attend them weekly. He al&s;o founded a large free &s;chool in Tem|ple-Street, Bri&s;tol, which was &s;et apart for the edu|cation and clothing of 40 boys; and likewi&s;e provided for ten old men in the city alms-hou&s;e; nor do I recollect that I ever was in any church throughout the city, but that a memorandum of his donations to &s;everal u&s;eful charities is recorded of him. I have likewi&s;e been informed of his building, at his own expence, the whole church and town of All Saints, near the Tol&s;ey, Bri&s;tol, together with tho&s;e many public charities now extant in that city. It has been frequently reported, that his private charities far ex|ceeded tho&s;e in public. I remember to have heard, in my youthful days, that one of his &s;hips, trading to the Ea&s;t-Indies, had been mi&s;&s;ing for upwards of three years, and was included in the number of tho&s;e that were de&s;troyed at &s;ea; but at length &s;he arrived, richly laden. His principal clerk brought him the report of her arrival, and of the riches on board; to which he gave an&s;wer, that as &s;he was totally given up for lo&s;t, he would by no means claim any right to her; there|fore ordered the &s;hip and her merchandizes to be &s;old, and the produce thereof to be applied towards the relief of the needy, which directions were immedi|ately carried into execution.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">Another &s;ingular in&s;tance of his tender con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s for charity was; at the age of forty, when he enter|tained &s;ome thoughts of changing his condition, he paid his addre&s;&s;es to a lady; but being very timerous, le&s;t he &s;hould be hindered in his pious and charitable de&s;igns, he was determined to make a Chri&s;tian trial of her temper and di&s;po&s;ition, and therefore one morning filled his pockets full of gold and &s;ilver, in order that if any object pre&s;ented it&s;elf in the cour&s;e of their tour over London-Bridge, he might &s;atisfy his intentions. While they were walking near St. Agnes church, a woman in extreme mi&s;ery, with twins in her lap, &s;at begging; and, as he and his intended lady were arm in arm, he beheld the wretched object, put his hand in his pocket, and took out a handful of gold and &s;ilver, ca&s;ting it into the poor woman's lap. The lady, being greatly alarmed at &s;uch profu&s;e genero&s;ity, coloured prodigiou&s;ly; &s;o that, when they were gone a little farther towards the Bridge foot, &s;he turned to him, and &s;aid, Sir! do you know what you did a few minutes ago? Madam, replied Mr. Col&s;on, I never let my right-hand know what my left-hand doth: He then took his leave of her, and for this rea&s;on never married to the day of his death, although he lived to the age of 83.</P>
<P>In the year 1721 he died at Mortlake, up the river Thames, having left many con&s;iderable legacies to charitable u&s;es. Providentially I was in the
<PB N="8" REF="11">
&s;chool at the time of his death, when orders were given for all the children to learn by heart the 90th P&s;alm, to &s;ing before the corp&s;e as it entered the city. which was at Lawford's Gate, where we joined the hear&s;e, and &s;ang before it the &s;pace of five hours, amid&s;t a mo&s;t numerous and crouded audience: It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe in what manner the hou&s;es and &s;treets were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined with all ranks of people; and al|though the rain de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cended in torrents, none paid any regard thereto; but the whole multitude &s;eemed eagerly determined to &s;ee the la&s;t of &s;o eminent a man! We came at la&s;t to All Saints church, where he was interred under the communion-table. The day of his birth, and al&s;o of his death, are commemorated to this day throughout the city of Bri&s;tol. His many donations to the poor are, by his executors, faithfully upheld &s;till. Here I conclude the perpetua|tive memory of &s;o good a man, which &s;till remains invaluable to me!</P>
<P>I now proceed to give an hi&s;torical account of my own life from my infancy, as far as it may be brought to my remembrance, which is from three years of age. I was then in petticoats, and, for a con&s;iderable le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gth of time, my &s;i&s;ter Dulcybella and &s;elf wandered into t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e woods and field, fixing our&s;elves under the hedges, conver&s;ing about God and happine&s;s; &s;o that at times I have been tran&s;ported in &s;uch a mea|&s;ure with heavenly bli&s;s, that whether in the body or
<PB N="9" REF="12">
out of the body, I could not tell; this happine&s;s attended me for a few years.</P>
<P>One remarkable circum&s;tance I would ob&s;erve: When my &s;i&s;ter and &s;elfwere very young, we wandered out into King's-Wood, and lo&s;t our&s;elves in the woods, and were in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, le&s;t we &s;hould be devoured by wild bea&s;ts; but quickly the kind pro|vidence of God permitted a large dog to come be|hind us; although no hou&s;e was within a mile from the wood, yet the dog drove us clear out of the wood into our knowledge; what was remarkable, the dog never barked at us! And when in our knowledge, we looked around us to behold the dog, but he was not to be &s;een. Being heedle&s;s, and unapprehen&s;ive of any further danger, we wandered again into the woods, and were a &s;econd time bewildered, and in greater perplexity than before; when on a &s;udden, looking around us, we beheld the &s;ame dog making toward us, 'till he came directly up to us; and we being much terrified ran from him, 'till we got a &s;econd time into our knowledge; nor did the dog leave us till we were driven by him where we could not po&s;&s;ibly run into any more labyrinths. I then turned about to look for the dog, but &s;aw no more of him, although we were upon an open common; this was the Lord's doing, and it was marvellous in our eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">When I arrived at the age of between &s;even and eight years I was put into Mr. Col&s;on's ho&s;pital, in the year 1719, and in the year 1725 was bound an apprentice to the &s;eas to Capt. Mo&s;es Lilly, in the &s;hip Prince of Wales, and &s;ailed from Bri&s;tol for Cork and Jamaica in the month of July, 1725.</P>
<P>Here I may date my fir&s;t &s;ufferings: Being wonderfully wrought on by the Spirit of God, and totally ignorant of the maxims of the world, having been confined for &s;ix years in the ho&s;pital, free from all intercour&s;e with mankind, this rendered the new &s;ea life very di&s;agreeable to me: Al&s;o my un|acquaintance with the various my&s;teries on &s;hip board, made me very untoward in the duty I was en|gaged in. The fir&s;t reception I met with on board, when the &s;hip lay in King-road, was to this effect: The chief mate called for the cabin-boy, but he not being on board, he &s;ent me to the cook to get him a plate of victuals, which I really imagined was meant for my&s;elf, and accordingly got a plate full, carried it down into the cabin, and, having a keen appetite, made a very comfortable dinner. When the chief mate had done his bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;ent for me, in order to bring his victuals: I told him, that I under&s;tood it was for my&s;elf, and that I had eat it up; upon which he knocked me down, and began cur&s;ing and damning me at a horrible rate. This language I was never ac|quainted with, therefore thought I &s;hould have broke my heart with grief; and having no friend, to whom
<PB N="11" REF="14">
I could apply for redre&s;s, I was forced to &s;uffer all the repeated acts of barbarity that might follow, which continued for eleven years.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of tho&s;e afflictions was that of &s;ea &s;ickne&s;s, which held me till our arrival at Jamaica. After lying at King&s;ton many months (not having any freight for England) the &s;hip made a voyage down to the Bay of Campeachy, in the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies, at which place &s;he lay at anchor about 12 miles from the land, where, with her bottom beating the ground every &s;well of the &s;ea, &s;he was exceedingly damaged. When we had completed our cargo we &s;ailed back for Jamaica, very &s;hort of all &s;pecies of provi&s;ion, ex|pecting to have a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age; but, to our mortifi|cation, it was a pa&s;&s;age of 14 weeks; and, after being out three weeks, we were put to &s;hort allowance, both of bread and water; one bi&s;cuit and two-thirds of a pint of water per day. This was what I never before experienced, and therefore it was the more grievous to be &s;u&s;tained; and had it not been for a heavy &s;hower of rain, off the i&s;land of Cuba, we mu&s;t have peri&s;hed for want. Here we &s;topped up all the &s;cuppers, and &s;aved about &s;ix ca&s;ks of water, by the u&s;e of the &s;wabs which we dried the decks with, and which we rung into the ca&s;ks; and although the water was very bitter, yet, providentially, our lives were pre|&s;erved thereby; for, we were reduced to half a pint of water a day, and that full of mud and mag|gots: yet were we three days before we arrived at Blue-Fields, the we&s;t end of Jamaica, without a &s;ingle
<PB N="12" REF="15">
pint of water on board, and had been eleven weeks de&s;titute of bi&s;cuit, pea&s;e, or flour; &s;o that we had neither food to eat, nor water to drink.</P>
<P>When we came to an anchor in Blue-Fields-Bay we boi&s;ted out the long-boat, &s;towed her full of ca&s;ks, and di&s;patched her for the fre&s;h water, when one of our men fell flat upon his bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and drank &s;o immode|rately, that a few hours after he came on board he expired; and the next morning we &s;ewed him up in a hammock and threw him overboard, when a large &s;hark de&s;cended after him, and, we &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;wal|lowed the whole body. As we were riding at anchor in King&s;ton Harbour, the capital of Jamaica, waiting for a freight to England, we at length got 105 hog|&s;heads of &s;ugar on board; and on a Friday a very great noi&s;e was heard in the atmo&s;phere, &s;imilar to that of &s;plitting wood, and the element was very much di&s;turbed; our chief mate was of opinion, that we &s;hould be vi&s;ited by a hurricane that evening, which began about eight o'clock the &s;ame night, and held its vehemency, without intermi&s;&s;ion, till &s;ix o'clock the following evening. All language fails me to &s;et forth the violence of this tempe&s;t, as nothing could &s;tand before it! There were in the harbour of King|&s;ton 76 &s;ail of &s;hips, many of which were very large; but all riding with three anchors a-head, and notwith|&s;tanding ours was a new &s;hip, with three new cables and anchors, yet, about four o'clock in the morning, we parted all three cables at once, and turning broad|&s;ide to the wind, over&s;et, and &s;unk as far as the ground
<PB N="13" REF="16">
would permit, and in that condition we were driven, with our gunnel to the bottom, down to the extremity of the harbour, which is about 12 miles. Though we were the fir&s;t &s;hip that drove from her anchors, yet all our ma&s;ts &s;tood; but this was not the &s;ituation of any ve&s;&s;el be&s;ide, for the whole fleet lo&s;t all their ma&s;ts, yards and bow&s;prit, and not one ve&s;&s;el, large or &s;mall, but was driven, with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity, high and dry on the land. The &s;ame hurricane al&s;o drove a large &s;now, of 220 tons, above half a mile into the country, which broke and tore the cocoa-nut trees, &s;ome of them up by the roots; likewi&s;e a very heavy brigantine was ca&s;t upon the wharfs in the town, and a large &s;loop, of about 100 tons, lay with her keel acro&s;s the brig's deck. In &s;hort, that part of the town neare&s;t the water-&s;ide was &s;ufficiently barricaded with the wrecks of &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els; and as there were no tides of ebb and flood, con&s;equently there was no po&s;&s;ibility of getting them off; nor were there any, &s;ave one fine &s;tately &s;hip, which rode out that tempe&s;t: So that &s;eventy-five &s;ail of &s;hips of war and merchantmen were inevitably de&s;troyed in the tremendous Overthrow. One remarkable in&s;tance I would take notice of, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;hip Nichol&s;on, Capt. Smiler, of London, quite a new and beautiful ve&s;&s;el, rode her bows out, &s;unk at her anchors, and all on board peri&s;hed, except the cap|tain's &s;on and four more, who were &s;aved by get|ting into a &s;mall boat, called the Mo&s;es, that carried no more than one hog&s;head of &s;ugar at a turn.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="17">All the &s;hips at Port-Royal &s;hared the &s;ame fate with tho&s;e at King&s;ton, except the Winchel&s;ea man of war, and Kirkington, of Bri&s;tol, Capt. Pills, both of which cut away their ma&s;ts, and were upon the brink of foundering even at the clo&s;e of the hurri|cane, which was on Saturday evening, about &s;ix o'clock. Here I would briefly ob&s;erve, how &s;uddenly the &s;torm cea&s;ed; it varied from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and was for a few hours calm; after which it chopped round to its former point, and blowing with a vehe|mence impo&s;&s;ible to be expre&s;&s;ed, la&s;ted near an hour, and was &s;ucceeded by a &s;econd calm. Two or three days after the reducement of the&s;e parts of the i&s;land, viz. King&s;ton and Port-Royal, and likewi&s;e of the dreadful con&s;equences of the &s;torm upon the fleet of &s;hips; the drowned &s;eamen were drove upon the &s;hore for miles down the harbour, and were left to be de|voured by the crows and other wild fowl.</P>
<P>Immediately after the hurricane followed a pe&s;ti|lential &s;ickne&s;s, which &s;wept away thou&s;ands of the natives: Every morning I have ob&s;erved between 30 and 40 corp&s;es to be carried pa&s;t my window; and, being very near death my&s;elf, I expected every day to approach with the me&s;&s;enger of my di&s;&s;olution. From this illne&s;s I contracted an habitual fever and ague, which continued eleven months, &s;o that I was wa&s;ted to a mere &s;hadow, nor had I one per&s;on under heaven to take care of me, except a negro, who brought me every day a do&s;e of je&s;uits-bark to the warehou&s;e, where I was laid in a hammock. At length my ma&s;ter
<PB N="15" REF="18">
gave me up, and I wandered up and down the town, almo&s;t parched with the in&s;ufferable blaze of the &s;un, till I was re&s;olved to lay me down and die, as I had neither money nor friend. Accordingly I fixed upon a dunghill on the ea&s;t end of the town of King&s;ton, and being in &s;o weak a condition, I pondered much upon Job's ca&s;e, and con&s;idered mine &s;imilar to that of his. However, I was fully re&s;igned to death, nor had I the &s;lighte&s;t expectations of relief from any quarter; yet the kind providence of God was over me, and rai&s;ed me up a friend in an entire &s;tranger. A London cap|tain coming by, was &s;truck with the &s;ordid object, came up to me, and, in a very compa&s;&s;ionate manner, a&s;ked me if I was &s;en&s;ible of any friend upon the i&s;land, of whom I could obtain relief. He likewi&s;e a&s;ked me to whom I belonged. I an&s;wered, to Captain Mo&s;es Lilly, and had been ca&s;t away in the late hur|ricane. This captain appeared to have &s;ome know|ledge of my ma&s;ter, and cur&s;ing him for a barbarous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llain, told me he would compel him to take proper care of me. In about a quarter of an hour after this my ma&s;ter arrived (whom I had not &s;een before for &s;ix weeks) and took me to a public hou&s;e, kept by a Mrs. Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chin&s;on, and there ordered me to be taken proper care of; this co&s;t my ma&s;ter about 40s. per week: However, he &s;oon quitted the i&s;land, and directed his cour&s;e for England, leaving me behind at his &s;ick quarters; and if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to permit my recovery, I was commanded to take my pa&s;&s;age for England in the Mont&s;errat, Captain

David Jones, a very fatherly tender-hearted man: This was the fir&s;t alleviation of my mi&s;ery. Now the captain &s;ent his &s;on on &s;hore, in order to re|ceive me on board; when I came along-&s;ide, Captain Jones, &s;tanding on the &s;hip's gunnel, addre&s;&s;ed me after a very humane and compa&s;&s;ionate manner, with expre&s;&s;ions to the following effect:
<Q>Come, poor child, into the cabin, and you &s;hall want nothing the &s;hip affords; go, and my &s;on &s;hall prepare for you, in the fir&s;t place, a ba&s;on of good egg flip, and any thing el&s;e that may be conducive to your relief&mdash;</Q>
but I being &s;till very bad with my fever and ague, could neither eat nor drink.</P>
<P>Captain Jones then began to explore his &s;urgery-box, in order to touch my ca&s;e with &s;ome proper medi|cines, if any were on board; but, to his di&s;appoint|ment, they were all expended. Notwith&s;tanding this, he &s;ent for the boat&s;wain into the cabin, and a&s;ked him, if he knew of any remedy for the intermitting fever. He told the captain, that he could not only produce a remedy, but that if I lived 50 years longer in the world, I &s;hould not be &s;ubject to it thereafter: This was in the year 1727, which is now 48 years out of the 50, and I do not remember to have experienced one fit of it &s;ince; and, altho' I had been afflicted with the ague eleven months, the boat&s;wain cured me in le&s;s than five hours. Here I began immediately to recover my &s;trength, and became more lively and active than ever I was in my life. Upon our &s;ailing for Bri&s;tol, Capt.

Jones being of a free, affable temper, in order to plea&s;e the &s;hip's company, &s;teered his cour&s;e to make the i&s;land of Bermudas, merely out of curio&s;ity, as it appears to be very di&s;tantly &s;ituated from the We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands. Upon our arrival thereat, we &s;cudded along &s;hore from one end of the i&s;land to the other; nor did I perceive either hill or mountain upon the whole i&s;land, it being a fine level gra&s;&s;y land. After we lo&s;t &s;ight of this i&s;land we made the be&s;t of our pa&s;&s;age for England; but in the pro&s;ecution thereof &s;omething rather &s;upernatural happened, and I &s;uppo&s;e may not be credited by many of my readers. Be that as it may, my intentions are not to advance beyond the bounds of truth in relating the following circum&s;tance, or in any other throughout this tract. &mdash;In the &s;pace of five weeks, after our departure from Bermudas, the captain ordered the man to keep a &s;harp look out at the fore-top-ma&s;t-head, as by our journal and calculation of the log-book we expected to be no great di&s;tance from Cape Clear, the we&s;t end of Ireland. Accordingly, one morning about &s;even o'clock, the centinel at the ma&s;t-head threw out the &s;ignal for land, about two points on the weather-bow; but as at that time the &s;hip was running with the wind on the &s;tarboard-beam, the captain deemed it mo&s;t advi&s;eable to brace all &s;harp up, and lie as near the wind as we po&s;&s;ibly could. The land &s;oon became con&s;picuous to the naked eye from the deck, and we altered our cour&s;e as the land edged round, but would not attempt to make any nearer approach towards it,
<PB N="18" REF="21">
than a full league. I frequently had my eye fixed upon the land, as had al&s;o the captain and all the &s;hip's company, while we were at work clearing the decks, bending the cables, and making our|&s;elves ready in all re&s;pects to adapt the &s;hip for an|chorage; or to be prepared for running into an har|bour, in ca&s;e of any &s;trait or emergency. I do not remember ever to have &s;een any place apparently more fertile, or better cultivated; the fields &s;eeming to be covered with verdure, and very beautiful; and as the &s;urf of the &s;ea almo&s;t convinced us that it was playing on the &s;hore, we were beyond all doubt for the &s;pace of ten hours, that the &s;hip had made a con|venient land-fall. Our captain therefore gave the man who fir&s;t di&s;covered it 10 gallons of rum and 20 pounds of &s;ugar; but about &s;ix o'clock in the even|ing, as we were wa&s;hing the decks, and the &s;un was &s;hining clear from the we&s;tward, in le&s;s than a minute we lo&s;t all &s;ight of the land, and nothing but the hori|zon, inter&s;per&s;ed with a few pale clouds, was percepti|ble from the deck: This filled the &s;hip's company with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment and confu&s;ion; nor did we make the coa&s;t of Ireland for &s;everal days after. Our captain and &s;hip's company concluded that it was Old Brazille, which navigators affirm to have been de&s;troyed by an earthquake between 5 and 600 years ago. At length we arrived at Bri&s;tol, and I was with my ma&s;ter, Capt. Mo&s;es Lilly, a few weeks, when he con&s;igned me over to a Timothy Tucker, commander of the Royal George, bound for Guinea and the We&s;t-Indies;
<PB N="19" REF="22">
a greater villain, I firmly believe, never ex|i&s;ted, although at home he a&s;&s;umed the character and temper of a &s;aint.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t demon&s;tration of his notorious conduct was given to the &s;hip's company, in the en|forcement of a white woman out of her native coun|try, and &s;elling her to the Black Prince of Bonny, on the African coa&s;t. The next proof of his villainy was the vile and bla&s;phemous language wherewith he per|petually governed the &s;eamen. Indeed, another exemplification of his horrid conduct was particularly noticed one Sunday morning; as I went down to the gun-room, in order to procure nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions for the &s;hip's company, the captain happened to find me at the bread ca&s;k, and declared that I was taking from thence con&s;iderably more than would be u&s;ed; therefore, he immediately went to the cabin, and brought out with him his large hor&s;e-whip, and exer|ci&s;ed it about my body in &s;o unmerciful a manner, that, not only the cloaths on my back were cut to pieces, but every &s;ailor on board declared they could &s;ee my bones, and that very vi&s;ibly; yet this act of barbari&s;m did not give him &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction, for he threw me all along the deck, and jumped many times upon the pit of my &s;tomach, in order to endanger my life; and had not the people laid hold of my two legs, and thrown me under the windla&s;s (after the manner they threw dead cats or dogs) he would have ended his de&s;potic cruelty in murder. Repeated in|&s;tances of this behaviour were committed by Capt.

Tucker to the principal part of his &s;eamen in the cour&s;e of the voyage to Bonny. One day I accom|panied the king Arigo on &s;hore for the benefit of my health (as the &s;avage had almo&s;t put an end to my life) and continued there for the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks, and &s;lept with the king's &s;on, prince Arigo, during the &s;ame. At this place the black king had 600 con|cubines, thirty of whom dwelt in his hou&s;e, and an elderly woman pre&s;ided over the re&s;t. One morning in particular I was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a racking pain in my head; I acquainted the queen, in Moori&s;h, with the cau&s;e of my indi&s;po&s;ition; &s;he informed his black maje&s;ty therewith, who ordered me &s;ome "doctor," as they term it; and about half a dozen of his ladies took me into a back yard, and &s;tripped me quite naked, even to my &s;kin, &s;at me on a joint-&s;tool, and gave me &s;ome yabba (or water) with a cloth to dry my&s;elf. I could not conceive what they purpo&s;ed to do with me, as the elder lady invented divers &s;tratagems to get me into a &s;tudious frame of mind; and when they perceived me quite fixed, looking at my feet, and I apprehending they were about to wa&s;h them with the hot water, &s;uddenly the female monitor, or pre&s;i|dent, &s;natched the cloth from out of the water, and threw it directly in my face, which &s;tartled me to &s;uch a degree, that it effectually removed the pain in an in&s;tant: Here I penetrated their maxims in perform|ing the cure. However, in about half an hour's time my pain revi&s;ited my head with greater violence than before; and I informed the queen that <HI>I&s;he was Oba|gona,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="24">
or my head was very bad: She then told his maje&s;ty that my di&s;order was returned, who &s;traightway collected his grandymen together, and they carried me to the &s;ummit of a certain hill (the acclivity whereof mu&s;t be impo&s;&s;ible for &s;trangers to &s;urmount) on the right-hand &s;ide of which was &s;ituated the king's palaver-hou&s;e, or place erected for their heatheni&s;h wor&s;hip; they took with them a dog, and about 100 roots, called yams. When I entered the hou&s;e, I was &s;truck with uncommon amazement at the &s;ight of 40 or 50 black mens heads hanged round this palaver-hou&s;e. Here I was inexpre&s;&s;ibly terrified, as I had received a very pious and Chri&s;tian education; &s;o that their dia|bolical and gro&s;s proceedings created great horror upon my &s;oul. At length they commenced the u&s;ual &s;acrifices to their gods; during which, one of the &s;enior cha|racters, who &s;ignalized him&s;elf by a &s;cimeter at his &s;ide, drew it, took the dog before-mentioned, laid it on the floor, and at one blow cut off its head. He then pulled the tongue out of its mouth, fa&s;tened it between its teeth, and in&s;tantly came and touched my forehead, cheeks, chin, and every joint, with the dog's tongue.</P>
<P>The king finding the&s;e re&s;ources to be ineffectual, proceeded further, and directed &s;ome of his people to &s;prinkle the du&s;t with a quantity of palm wine, and to lead me through a trackle&s;s de&s;ert down to the &s;hip, conceiving the wine (as there was no water to be had) might create a path to the &s;ea &s;hore. This an&s;wered, and prince Arigo, the king's &s;on, hailed the &s;hip, which lay at a &s;mall di&s;tance from land, and de&s;ired
<PB N="22" REF="25">
them to &s;end the boat on &s;hore, as <HI>Piccaninni Bacca|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eau was yarre, yarre,</HI> that is, "was very &s;ick:" Accordingly it was done, and when I came on board Tucker, with a grim countenance, and horrid expre&s;|&s;ions, a&s;ked me what ailed me. I replied, that I had a &s;trong fever on me. Then, &s;aid he, I will &s;oon cure you; &s;o he went and brought his hor&s;e-whip, and, although I was extremely &s;ick, he whipt me unmerci|fully! Yet, however, his medicine did not perform the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re, but heightened my fever, &s;o that I was nearly brought to the gates of death; yet God rai&s;ed me up again. Upon our arrival at St. Thomay, or St. Tho|mas, the European woman, which Tucker brought out from England, died in a &s;hocking manner, was &s;ewed up in a hammock, and thrown overboard with a bag of balla&s;t at her feet, in order to &s;ink her; but in the cour&s;e of a week afterwards the corp&s;e of the woman was ob&s;erved to float upon the water: I believe God had &s;uffered this uncommon circum&s;tance to happen in order to open the eyes of our wicked captain; but he had no dread or remor&s;e in him.</P>
<P>I cannot but give one more in&s;tance of the barbarity of this captain during the voyage, and his gro&s;s manner of executing it (as a more bloody and inhuman action &s;urely never was perpetrated by an Engli&s;hman, except him&s;elf.) This was upon one of our black &s;laves, who thro' a violent &s;ickne&s;s was worn to a mere &s;keleton, and as he could not eat his allowance, the &s;avage (Tucker) invented a &s;cheme to compel the &s;lave to eat, and laid to his charge that he was &s;ulky: However, the poor
<PB N="23" REF="26">
creature could not, nor did he eat. Upon this the captain called for his black cabin boy, Robin, to bring him his hor&s;e-whip: He did &s;o, and Tucker began la&s;h|ing the poor &s;ick man till, I firmly believe, from his neck to his ancles, there was nothing to be &s;een but bloody wounds. The poor creature made no kind of re|&s;i&s;tance, nor &s;poke one word: This provoked and highly incen&s;ed our blood-thir&s;ty devil; &s;o that he went &s;till farther, and told him in Negroi&s;h, he would <HI>tickeravoo</HI> him. The poor &s;lave an&s;wered, "<HI>Adomma,</HI>" which &s;ignified, "So be it." By this time the captain's dinner was ready under the awning on the quarter-deck; he left the man in &s;hocking agonies, bleeding and groaning on the foreca&s;tle; came to his dinner like a hog, and eat without fear or &s;hame. After he had dined, he called for John Lad, and ordered him to get two ammunition pi&s;tols well loaded with ball; then called for Robin, the cabin-boy, to bring them forward, which when done, he left his table, and or|dered John Lad to follow him, which he accordingly did with one pi&s;tol in each hand. They both went forward on the main-deck; the poor object &s;at with his back again&s;t the larboard-gunnel of the &s;hip. Then Tucker, with a malicious and virulent grin, pointing one of the pi&s;tols to him, told him it would kill him. The man replied as before, "<HI>Adomma.</HI>" Upon this the captain applied the mouth of the pi&s;tol to the middle of his forehead, and fired. The man in&s;tantly clapped his hands to his head, one behind, and the other before, and &s;tared the captain in the
<PB N="24" REF="27">
face, the blood gu&s;hing from his forehead like the tapping a ca&s;k, but he did not fall. Tucker then turn|ing to John Lad, with a bla&s;phemous oath &s;aid, "This will not kill him;" and immediately clapped another to his ear, and fired that al&s;o; nor did he drop, even then! At la&s;t the captain ordered John Lad to fire another through his heart, which was done; he then dropt down dead. All the men &s;laves, in con&s;equence of this uncommon murder, ro&s;e upon the &s;hip's company, with full purpo&s;e to &s;lay us all; but we nimbly betaking our&s;elves to the cannons, point|ed them through a bulk-head that parted the main and quarter deck; which, when they perceived, the greater part of them ran down between decks, and the remainder jumped overboard, and were all drowned, &s;ave one or two which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Jolly boat, we re&s;cued from the violence of the &s;ea. At length we arrived at Barbadoes, when captain Tucker's notorious conduct was repre&s;&s;ed in &s;ome mea&s;ure, which was vi&s;ibly perceived by his &s;ending the &s;laves large quantities of rum and &s;ugar. Yet, on his leaving that i&s;land, he renewed his former cruelties; but did not exerci&s;e them on me with that degree of &s;everity which he had frequently u&s;ed in the pa&s;&s;age to King&s;ton.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of eight weeks we arrived at Bri&s;tol, and my original ma&s;ter (Mo&s;es Lilly) received all my wages, but allowed me no pocket-money; and fit|ted me out very &s;cantily for the next voyage.&mdash; Having no friend or relation in London, I was drawn in to perform a &s;econd voyage with Tucker (the bare
<PB N="25" REF="28">
idea of which almo&s;t broke my heart;) yet he treated me with le&s;s rigour than in the voyage before.</P>
<P>I have only two circum&s;tances to remark in this voyage; the fir&s;t was, when &s;laved and ready to &s;ail for Bonny, we dropt down, and came to anchor a little without the Bar, and at about twelve o'clock at night an univer&s;al &s;hriek was heard among the &s;laves between decks; and, being a&s;ked what ailed them, they, with wild confu&s;ion of mind, &s;aid, that <HI>Egbo,</HI> or the devil was among them. The next morning, when we came to open the hatches to admit the air into their loath&s;ome dens, and for the purpo&s;e of di&s;|charging their tubs, to our great &s;urpri&s;e, we found a number of them laying dead; upon hoi&s;ting up about 80 of them, we &s;ave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 39, and the re&s;t, having irrecoverably lo&s;t their breath in the &s;uffocation, the captain directed us to ca&s;t them overboard, which was in&s;tantly done, 40 in number.</P>
<P>A &s;econd circum&s;tance, which happened on board our &s;hip, and which I think my&s;elf compelable to relate, was the captain's inhuman cruelty to the &s;hip's cook. The poor man had nothing but green-wood to make his furnace boil with, on which account it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to get the food ready in time; therefore the captain habituated him&s;elf to certain practices, &s;uch as hor&s;e-whiping him, and &s;tabbing a knife into his face, &s;o that the poor man's life was grievou&s;ly burthen&s;ome to him; indeed he oftentimes
<PB N="26" REF="29">
hinted to us that he would throw him&s;elf overboard, but we endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from it; yet, one morning, about eight o'clock, poor John Bundy plunged him&s;elf into the &s;ea without our knowledge; &s;o that we diligently &s;earched the &s;hip for him, but he could not be found. We informed the captain of it, who an&s;wered with &s;ome degree of plea&s;ure, that he &s;aw a hat &s;wimming a-&s;tern, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was the b&mdash;d of a b&mdash;'s hat; yet, notwith&s;tanding this heart-breaking u&s;age, we providentially completed the voyage.</P>
<P>After this I was &s;hipped on board the Scipio, Capt. Roach, who was much of a &s;eaman, a plea&s;ant tem|pered gentleman, and exceeding free and liberal with all his &s;hip's company; but he having purcha&s;ed a fine black girl for his own u&s;e, &s;he, in the end, proved the cau&s;e of his death. One evening, as we lay at anchor in New Callabar, one Tom Ancrao came on board who talked very good Engli&s;h, and the facetious Capt. Roach having made a tub of punch on the quarter-deck, had the fidler and the &s;hip's company dancing with him, but left me with Tom Ancora to purcha&s;e the &s;laves. When this was done, Tom de&s;ired me to give him a dram, which I did; he then de&s;ired me to let the bottle &s;tand: I told him I mu&s;t fir&s;t obtain the captain's leave for &s;o doing. I then went to Capt. Roach, who gave me leave. Tom, at this indulgence, filled a rummer with brandy, and cla&s;ping the black girl in his arms (as their cu&s;tom is) they put both their mouths to the gla&s;s, and
<PB N="27" REF="30">
jointly drank thereout; but unfortunately for Capt. Roach, he came into the cabin and detected them in that atti|tude while drinking, which &s;o provoked him, that he ran the end of his cane into Tom's mouth, broke the tumbler, and knocked out all his front teeth, although he had a fine &s;et. The captain then ran to his &s;tate-room for one of his loaded pi&s;tols; but Tom, apprehen&s;ive of his danger, jumped over-board. It being dark, and the tide of ebb flowing &s;trong, Tom's canoe dropt a-&s;tern, took him up, and carried him on &s;hore. Our captain was re&s;olved to go on &s;hore to clo&s;e the breach that was made; but the &s;hip's com|pany all earne&s;tly &s;trove to convince him of the imprudence of going to Tom Ancora's hou&s;e; yet, if he was bent upon going, they intreated him not to eat or drink any thing. However, Capt. Roach was re&s;olutely deaf to all their kind expo&s;tulations; he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a &s;carlet plu&s;h &s;uit, put his &s;word on, and went to Tom's hou&s;e; but he being too &s;ubtle for the captain, carried it fair and ea&s;y, and &s;eemed to be very friendly, but took care to give the captain a &s;trong do&s;e of poi&s;on, which in three days time operated &s;o effectually upon him, that the fingers on both his hands were drawn into the palms, and all his toes were drawn under his feet; hence it evi|dently appeared to all the traders that Tom Ancora had poi&s;oned Capt. Roach.</P>
<P>Next morning one Dick Ebrew and his &s;on came on board, and de&s;ired to learn what kind of eatables he
<PB N="28" REF="31">
partook of, and whether it was hot or cold, while at Tom Ancora's hou&s;e; &s;aying, if he would &s;imply tell them, it was not impo&s;&s;ible for them to expel the poi|&s;on, and &s;ave his life; the&s;e two men I have often ad|mired for their meek and loving &s;pirit, exceedingly far beyond tens of thou&s;ands who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians: However, all their rea&s;oning with the captain, to convince him that he was poi&s;oned, proved ineffectual, as he in&s;i&s;ted upon it he was not; and again, the others as &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon it that he was. At length the benevolent father and his &s;on parted with our captain in a plaintive condition (their eyes expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ame) as they had not the op|portunity of pre&s;erving his life; he being a man greatly e&s;teemed among&s;t the natives for his courteous be|haviour.</P>
<P>Before I proceed any farther, I would relate the behaviour of our cooper and a black, whom we named Adam. When the &s;hip was &s;ailing over the Bar, Adam had planned the cutting off the &s;hip's company, which, when perceived by the other &s;laves, they joined the mutiny, and on a &s;udden ro&s;e and &s;eized the cook, and threw him into the furnace of boiling rice; they likewi&s;e attacked the boat&s;wain, took from him his knife, and &s;tabbed him in &s;everal parts of the body, and threw him over-board. Wells, the cooper, hearing the di&s;turbance, came up out of the hold, upon which Adam al&s;o &s;eized him; but the
<PB N="29" REF="32">
cooper &s;aid to him, "Adam, you no &s;avee me, <HI>to&s;&s;ue you mini</HI>?" The Engli&s;h of which is, "Don't you know I often give you water?" Adam then &s;aid to him, "<HI>To&s;&s;ue coopery,</HI>" which is, "Get out of the way." The cooper then got over the quarter-deck bulk-head to the arms che&s;t, took up a loaded pi&s;tol, and &s;hot Adam through the head; the other &s;laves, at &s;eeing their champion dead, ran all down between decks, were clo&s;ely confined, and admirably well &s;e|cured, to prevent a &s;econd ma&s;&s;acre; and as the cap|tain lay dangerou&s;ly ill, and only five men able to work the &s;hip, we, with the greate&s;t and mo&s;t elaborate toil, reached the We&s;t-Indies in three weeks.&mdash; Upon the &s;hip's arrival there, the owner of her made the cooper a pre&s;ent of &pound;60 for his &s;ervices on board her at the time of tho&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations. I would again ob&s;erve, before I return to Capt. Roach, while we lay at Callabar, and ju&s;t previous to our &s;ailing, the captain &s;ent me on &s;hore armed, with two men, to what is called, "Enforcement of trade." Accord|ingly I went on &s;hore, with a cutla&s;s by my &s;ide, and in my hands two loaded pi&s;tols. When I arrived at the top of the hill, I heard an uncommon &s;hrieking of women, and as I drew near a divi&s;ion of hou&s;es I &s;aw what (through curio&s;ity) I had long wi&s;hed to &s;ee, namely, <HI>Egbo,</HI> a native, in a fine &s;ilk gra&s;s me&s;hed net, &s;o curiou&s;ly made to fit him, that nothing but his hands and feet appeared; the net ended with a fringe, not unlike ruffles. This man is looked upon as both
<PB N="30" REF="33">
God and devil, and all &s;tand in the mo&s;t profound awe of him, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;tood &s;till to &s;ee the &s;equel of his caprice, and ob|&s;erved that in his hand he had a green bough, where|with he was whipping the womens po&s;teriors, as they went naked, and cha&s;ing them out of one hou&s;e into another; and as they were exceedingly terrified, and con&s;idered it a heavy cur&s;e when <HI>Egbo</HI> &s;truck them, therefore they fled from him as we would flee from hell flames. However, when he had &s;atisfied him&s;elf by la&s;hing the poor women, he came out through the middle of the court, and through the me&s;hes of his net, I was di&s;covered by him. Pre&s;ently he advanced towards me, with full purpo&s;e to let me al&s;o feel the weight of his green bough; upon which I in&s;tantly drew my hanger, with a re&s;olution to cut off his head. He then ran away, and I &s;aw him no more. After|wards I was vi&s;ited by &s;ome of the chief men in the town, &s;aying, "<HI>Bacareau,</HI> you no fear <HI>Egbo</HI>?" I replied, "Not I, and that if he had offered to &s;trike me I would have cut his head off." At which an&s;wer they could not help laughing heartily, and then re|tired.</P>
<P>I now return to continue the thread of my account of Capt. Roach, and the further particulars of my voyage to Jamaica. My reader may ob&s;erve, that I le&s;t the de&s;cription of our proceedings upon Old Callabar, at our captain lo&s;ing the u&s;e of his limbs;
<PB N="31" REF="34">
at length he found the poi&s;on to work fatally upon him, &s;o that he was reduced to an inability of helping him|&s;elf. The whole burthen then fell on my hands, nor would he &s;uffer any other to approach him. I con|ducted my&s;elf in the di&s;agreeable function tolerably well, till we anchored under St. Thomas's fort, on a Portugue&s;e i&s;land, lying about 300 miles to the we&s;t|ward of the Coa&s;t of Africa, where Capt. Roach directed me to &s;ell the &s;urplus of cargo, after purcha&s;ing the Guinea &s;laves, &amp;c. I went accordingly on &s;hore with the remaining part of the cargo to the Scrivan's hou&s;e. The governor's principal clerk bartered with me for gold-du&s;t, broken and damaged jewels, rings, &amp;c. which amounted to the &s;um of &pound;630: He put it into a very curiou&s;ly-made bag, the better to enable me to keep it &s;ecure. I took the afore&s;aid &s;um in my right|hand, and as I was walking deliberately down to the Beach, &s;winging it backwards and forwards, a little black boy came behind me, &s;natched the bag of gold out of my hand, and fled out of &s;ight before I could well look round me. Here I was left in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation at &s;o great a lo&s;s; but in a few minutes, to my un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction, I perceived the Scrivan, from whom I had received the gold, ha&s;tening down upon the Beach with the bag in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is hand, who had met the boy flying up the town with it. He then gave me the bag and money, and &s;aid, "Sir, be more careful of your property for the fu|ture, e&s;pecially when you are in a &s;trange country." I was inconceivably thankful, and am ready to affirm,
<PB N="32" REF="35">
that this Portugue&s;e was actuated with &s;tronger princi|ples of honour (e&s;pecially in this in&s;tance to a &s;tranger) than thou&s;ands of my countrymen would have been to a native of their own country.</P>
<P>By this time our captain grew wor&s;e, and one day with his &s;tool came &s;everal large clots of blood from him, one of which re&s;embled a fowl's kidney, and the bulk was nearly equal to that of a pigeon's egg. When I informed the captain thereof, he lifted up his eyes and hands (I hope his heart too) to heaven, repeating the&s;e words, "Lord Je&s;us, receive my &s;pirit." From this time he voided larger clots of blood, &s;o that it was computed two or three and thirty pounds of blood had been di&s;charged from him at various times. He &s;trictly charged the &s;urgeon to open him when dead, for the &s;atisfaction of his wife. He &s;oon after made his exit, and upon his body's dif|fection, the &s;urgeon pointed out to us the my&s;tery of the poi&s;on, and its operation; likewi&s;e the cau&s;e of his voiding &s;uch quantities of blood, which was in con&s;equence of the veins acro&s;s his &s;tomach being cut by the poi&s;on into 500 pieces. He was then &s;ewed up in his hammock, with a bag of balla&s;t fa&s;tened to his feet, and committed to the great deep; and I firmly believe he had all his &s;ufferings here.</P>
<P>Various occurrences happened in the &s;hip during the captain's illne&s;s, but I &s;hall particularly remark
<PB N="33" REF="36">
only the circum&s;tance of one, which, I apprehend, was rather of an ominous nature. Every day, in the cour&s;e of his weakne&s;s in body, he made repeated efforts to reach the cabin windows, in order to receive the cooling air, and at whatever times he looked in the water, a devil fi&s;h was regularly &s;wimming at the &s;tern of the &s;hip; he did not appear to be a fi&s;h of prey, but his breadth from fin to fin was about 28 feet, and in length about &s;even or eight, with a wide tail, and two ivory horns in front. He followed the &s;hip, to our be&s;t calculation, near 1800 miles; nor was it remembered by any of the &s;hip's crew that a fi&s;h of that nature had made its appearance in the cour&s;e of any of their voyages. Perpetual attempts to de&s;troy or catch this mon&s;ter was made, by the fa&s;tening a thick rope round the body of a dead negro, and ca&s;ting him over-board, but it was ineffectual; the fi&s;h &s;wam clo&s;e under our &s;tern, got his horns entangled in the rope, under-run it to the end, and then to&s;&s;ed his refu&s;ed prey &s;everal yards above the water. When the captain died he for&s;ook the &s;hip, and we &s;aw him no more.</P>
<P>Our chief-mate, James Seabons, on the death of Capt. Roach, undertook the command of the &s;hip, and after a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age of a few days &s;he arrived at Jamaica. While we were lying at moorings, and tar|rying in the harbour for a freight, the &s;hip was over|run with rats, and, by our judgment, there were thou&s;ands on board; this we deemed an ill omen,
<PB N="34" REF="37">
which indeed proved &s;o in a &s;hort &s;pace of time. When the &s;hip &s;ailed from Jamaica, we had a difficult ta&s;k to &s;teer through the windward pa&s;&s;age; but at length we weathered the ea&s;t end of Jamaica, and directed a &s;teady cour&s;e between that and Hi&s;paniola, and the ea&s;t end of Cuba. About three o'clock in the after|noon, having a fair wind, by which the &s;hip was &s;cudding eleven or twelve miles an hour, we &s;uddenly di&s;covered a very large &s;loop clo&s;e in &s;hore, under Cape Nichela. Our captain, being a young mariner, took her to be a New York &s;loop, bound for Jamaica. We in&s;tantly hauled up our cour&s;es and lay too; but, as &s;he &s;wiftly bore down upon us, our captain &s;hortly found his mi&s;take, as &s;he proved to be a Spani&s;h Guarda la Cofta, or, what was more redoubtable, a Spani&s;h pirate. The enemy's ve&s;&s;el was exceedingly large, full of guns and men: our captain was then very a&s;&s;iduous, and exerted, him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t, in the means of &s;aving the &s;hip, but the men would neither fight nor fly; &s;o that the captain was con|&s;trained to &s;urrender the &s;hip, cargo and men, to the di&s;po&s;al of the enemy.</P>
<P>When we were boarded, the Spani&s;h &s;ailors began to plunder us, &s;tripping and taking all away, from the captain down to the cabin-boy; nor did they &s;pare the cloaths on our backs, but in turn of them clothed us with their filthy ragged frocks and drawers. They killed all our poultry, and &s;et us to picking them; put
<PB N="35" REF="38">
on the &s;hip's large kettle, and boiled both fowls and ducks. They likewi&s;e took away all our compa&s;&s;es, &s;ave two that had been &s;poiled with the rain on the Coa&s;t of Africa. In &s;hort, they took away every u&s;e|ful article, and left us totally de&s;titute of carpenter's, cooper's, and boat&s;wain's tools. They then informed us, that, at eight o'clock the next morning, every one of us, without di&s;tinction, partiality or re&s;erve, &s;hould be hanged, and that without ceremony, and had al&s;o the barbarity to pre&s;ent to us the place and the &s;caffold erected for that purpo&s;e, which was on the platform under Cape Nichola; and we had every rea&s;on to fear that they would have carried their de&s;igns into execution, had not the Providence of God interpo&s;ed, by making me the in&s;trument of our deliverance therefrom. The happy circum&s;tance was this; I frequently kept the &s;hip's accounts in the captain's ab&s;ence, and was ordered to do &s;o when he was re|moved on board the Spani&s;h pirate. I then &s;ecured his gold watch, and depo&s;ited the &s;ame among&s;t the coals in the fore-peak, and brought our &s;hip to an anchor clo&s;e under the enemy's &s;tern, where we re|mained all night.</P>
<P>When the enemy's under captain had di&s;continued his plundering, their principal, or Spani&s;h com|mander, repaired on board the capture, and brought our ma&s;ter with him, in order to &s;pend the evening together; and in the cour&s;e of their conver&s;ation, the Spani&s;h captain (to my extreme grief and di&s;appoint|ment)
<PB N="36" REF="39">
a&s;ked captain Seaborn if he had &s;uch a thing as a watch on board? He replied, "Sir, I had a gold watch on board, and a &s;ilver one, but I am afraid they are lo&s;t in the plunder:" However, the captain wi&s;ely a&s;ked me if I knew whether it was &s;tolen, or whether I had taken care of it my&s;elf; if I had, he &s;aid it would be the &s;ure means of &s;aving our lives. I told him that I had hid it in the fore-peak among&s;t the coals. I was then directed to go and bring it; but one of the Spani&s;h common &s;eamen, knowing for what I was &s;ent thither, followed me down the fore|&s;cuttle, and when I had pocketed the watch, he took up a billet of wood, &s;truck me a blow on my left ear, which &s;tunned me, and then took the watch from out of my pocket. Notwith&s;tanding my in&s;en&s;ibility I could take particular notice of the fellow, that if I &s;urvived the blow he might be apprehended. In about twenty minutes. I came to my&s;elf, went and informed our captain of what had happened, who a&s;ked me if I knew the man again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t I told him, he was leaning with his left-arm on the &s;hip's gunnel: He then informed the Spani&s;h captain of it, who went with me to the man, and demanded the watch. The da&s;tardly fellow went on his knees, and &s;urrendered it, and was after|wards, with all his plundering companions, by the command of their captain, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from our &s;hip, and &s;ent on board their own. They all returned to their own ve&s;&s;el in launches; and after their captain had di&s;cour&s;ed with ours about the &s;pace of 40 minutes, he returned on board his own &s;hip likewi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="40">We &s;till remained in a &s;tate of anxiety in re&s;pect to our de&s;tiny; but at eight o'clock the next morning a deci&s;ion took place, by the Spani&s;h captain hailing our &s;hip, and de&s;iring us to weigh anchor, and direct our immediate cour&s;e for England. The un|common joy which this reprieve produced in the hearts of every &s;ailor on board our &s;hip, was infinitely beyond what I am able to de&s;cribe in this narrative. Each of us danced, &s;kipped and jumped about, from one end of the &s;hip to the other, in&s;omuch that &s;everal &s;ailors were quite fatigued, and an utter &s;top was made to our nece&s;&s;ary duty. But when this ex&s;tacy was &s;ub|&s;ided, and the &s;hip's company more compo&s;ed, we im|mediately hove a-head, weighed anchor with great plea&s;ure, made &s;ail with a favourable breeze, and, in the &s;pace of two hours, left the land &s;even leagues a|&s;tern. My reader will remember, that the &s;hip's company was threatened with execution the morning of the reprieve, therefore the irre&s;i&s;tible joy we all experienced may be ea&s;ily accounted for. However, greater misfortunes and cro&s;s providences were yet to come, for the third day after our e&s;cape from the pirate, by the officers ob&s;ervation and the &s;hip's reckon|ing, we apprehended that the ve&s;&s;el was no great di&s;tance from Crooked I&s;land; therefore a diligent lookout at the ma&s;t-head was ordered to be kept. Preci&s;ely at ten o'clock, P. M. the centinel called out to the man at the wheel, and begged him in&s;tantly to put the helm hard at lee, as there were 50 &s;ail of
<PB N="38" REF="41">
&s;hips on the lee-bow at no great di&s;tance. We were at that time &s;cudding with the wind quarterly (all our &s;teering-&s;ails &s;et) at the rate of 12 or 13 miles an hour. The &s;hip quickly an&s;wered her helm, but having &s;uch a croud of &s;ail upon her, and the mariners not being &s;ufficiently active to haul them down at &s;o &s;hort a notice, we found that, in&s;tead of &s;hipping, we were &s;urrounded with dreadful breakers on a reef of rocks, and &s;o very &s;teep withal, that when the &s;hip's &s;tern tended round, any per&s;on could have jumped off the &s;hip's tafferel upon them. Having &s;o exceeding &s;wift a way through the water, &s;he drew a little off from the rocks; yet, by rea&s;on of her mi&s;&s;ing &s;tays, &s;he fell off again, and the fir&s;t blow &s;he &s;truck, a pro|jected part of a rock went through her bottom, and in a few minutes the whole &s;hip was full of water. By the deep-&s;ea line we found that her &s;tern lay in 80 fathoms, and had &s;he not been held fa&s;t by this rock, every one on board mu&s;t inevitably have peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of tho&s;e &s;uffering &s;ea&s;ons, we all ex|perimentally knew the merciful hand of Almighty God was over us; for if the &s;hip had not &s;truck on the &s;pot where &s;he providentially did, it would have been an utter impo&s;&s;ibility for any one on board to have reached the land, as we afterwards found there was no pa&s;&s;age through the reef, except that part whereon the ve&s;&s;el was wrecked. Seeing no pro&s;pect of ever &s;ecuring the lea&s;t part of her hull, we u&s;ed all diligence at every po&s;&s;ible opportunity to &s;ave part
<PB N="39" REF="42">
of her cargo. We &s;peedily hoi&s;ted out our long-boat, and &s;towed &s;everal bags of bread therein, together with an old fore-&s;ail, wherewith we intended to make a tent on &s;hore; but the boat being exceedingly rot|ten, with many leaks in her bottom, and having no tools on board to &s;top them before we could reach the landing-place, to our mortification the boat &s;unk to the gunnel, and totally &s;poiled all our bread; yet, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Almighty, we all e&s;caped to land with the fore-&s;ail, with which, and the help of two long poles, we erected a &s;mall tent, for the purpo&s;e of keeping off the in&s;ufferable heat, and &s;corching influ|ence of the &s;un.</P>
<P>When the evening approached, the captain directed us to run the yawl backwards and forwards from the ea&s;t to we&s;t parts of the i&s;land, in order to di&s;cover the town or inhabitants (if any) whereby to obtain &s;ome refre&s;hment; but, after having &s;pent eight hours in that hazardous excur&s;ion, we perceived that the i&s;land was totally uninhabited. Here another fre&s;h &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s pre&s;ented it&s;elf. As we could get no provi&s;ion from the &s;hip, we were deter|mined to &s;earch the i&s;land for both food and water; we did &s;o, but without &s;ucce&s;s; nor was the land pro|ductive of any animal or vegetable &s;pecies, but an abundance of land crabs and &s;hell fi&s;h. The&s;e evident marks of de&s;olation and barrenne&s;s gave birth to vari|ous re&s;ources, in order to &s;upport life; and accordingly three or four of us were compelled by the captain to
<PB N="40" REF="43">
venture our&s;elves naked into the &s;ea, and &s;wim on board the &s;hip (if po&s;&s;ible) for the purpo&s;e of getting &s;uch water as was not &s;poilt; and, notwith&s;tanding the wreck lay full two miles from the &s;hore, yet we effected our purpo&s;e in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>Having hoi&s;ted out three ca&s;ks of fre&s;h water, we left them to be driven on &s;hore by the &s;trength of a con&s;tant &s;ea-breeze and the waves together, which, in the &s;pace of ten minutes, &s;ent them &s;o near the land, as to be rolled up the beach by our &s;eamen on &s;hore. My readers may be &s;urpri&s;ed at our &s;wimming two miles upon a &s;tretch; but let it be ob&s;erved, that there were many &s;mall rocks lying between the &s;hore and the &s;hip, &s;o that when we were almo&s;t wearied out, they &s;erved us for re&s;ting places; though, truly, we never quitted the&s;e rocks, but at the immediate hazard of our lives, &s;eeing there were a multiplicity of &s;harks and alligators perpetually &s;porting throughout the Bay. I perfectly well remember to have &s;een three &s;harks divide a man's body in the harbour of St. Tomay, on the coa&s;t of Africa; the fir&s;t &s;eized one of his hind|quarters, and wrenched it off at the fir&s;t &s;hake; a &s;econd attacked the other hind-quarter, and took that away likewi&s;e; when a third furiou&s;ly attacked the remainder of the body, and greedily devoured the whole thereof.</P>
<P>I was &s;ubject to many dreadful apprehen&s;ions in the performance of my exploits, lea&s;t a circum&s;tance of
<PB N="41" REF="44">
this kind &s;hould befal me likewi&s;e, but the Lord was my &s;ure protector. After we had weathered three weeks in this deplorable &s;ituation, and expo&s;ed to the malignancy of the inclement atmo&s;phere, the mo&s;|chettos, like &s;warms of bees, di&s;covered our per&s;ons, and pierced our fle&s;h &s;everely with their poi&s;onous &s;tings, ina&s;much that we were all nece&s;&s;itated to bury our&s;elves in the &s;and, even our hands and faces (clear|ing only our mouths and no&s;trils at certain times, for the admittance of air and di&s;charge of breath) or we &s;hould certainly have been &s;tung to death.</P>
<P>Our captain then a&s;ked who would undertake to proceed with him towards the N. W. part of the i&s;land, as he conceived that would be the only means of find-a remedy. I readily complied with his propo&s;al, and jumped into the boat, accompanied by four others and the captain; and upon our leaving the i&s;land we left tho&s;e trouble&s;ome companions the in&s;ects. Here it may be well to ob&s;erve the goodne&s;s of God in &s;ending the&s;e in&s;ects to drive us out to &s;ea. Our captain being inclined to run round the i&s;land, in order to make what di&s;coveries he could, we &s;ailed about 30 miles round to the S. W. where we found a fine bay. As the boat (having but a light breeze) imperceptibly advanced to the land, we di&s;cerned &s;everal Flemingo birds, and as they were a fowl of the fir&s;t magnitude, we all imagined that they were &s;ome per&s;ons who in|habited the place; but when we arrived at the rocks we found our mi&s;take, and were under the nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="42" REF="45">
of revi&s;iting that truly di&s;agreeable reef of rocks, whereon our &s;hip was ca&s;t away.</P>
<P>Upon our approach to the &s;hore &s;everal of our people, with over-joy, de&s;ired us to run out to &s;ea, as there was a ve&s;&s;el in the Offing. The captain immediately &s;teered through the Gut, and we happily met her about half a mile from the wreck of our &s;hip. When we came near to the &s;tranger, the &s;eamen pre&s;ented loaded blunderbu&s;&s;es at us, and told us to keep off, or they would certainly fire upon us. We begged to inform them that we were in great di&s;tre&s;s, our &s;hip being lo&s;t on the reef of rocks, and that the remainder of our people were on &s;hore in a tent. Their captain then, with &s;ome warmth, declared, if we did not keep our boat at a greater di&s;tance from their &s;hip, he would di&s;charge a &s;ix-pounder at us, and &s;end both yawl and men to the bottom. He likewi&s;e a&s;&s;erted, that we were pirates, that our &s;hip was not lo&s;t, but riding at an anchor; and that we had no authority to lay in tho&s;e uninhabited parts of the world. We expo&s;tulated with the captain a con&s;iderable time, and at length he permitted us to repair on board.</P>
<P>When we had &s;o done, the captain, who&s;e name was Cabel Bean, ran clo&s;e in &s;hore, embarked the re|mainder of our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed companions by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their yawl, and, after having interrogated them re&s;pecting their cata&s;trophe, he found that our relation was &s;trictly true.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="46">As we had many valuables on board, which we &s;up|po&s;ed had received no damage, the ve&s;&s;el (which was called the Patomack &s;loop) &s;tood off and on till, with their boats and our yawl, we had &s;aved goods to the amount of &pound;1200, in anchors, cables, rigging, rum, pimento, cotton, &amp;c. and as the ve&s;&s;el had nothing on board but balla&s;t, it was more adapted to receive the &s;poilt goods; while we were thus employed, a large turtle boat, from Virginia, hove in &s;ight; the ma&s;ter's name was Sims, a Molatta, he likewi&s;e lent us the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his boat and crew in recovering the &s;poils of our cargo. After we had &s;aved every thing within the reach of po&s;&s;ibility, Sims, the Molatta, took three or four of us, with the two captains, round to the N. &s;ide of the i&s;land, in order to in&s;truct us in the my&s;tery of fi&s;h catching, &s;o that we might in &s;ome degree alleviate our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, if we &s;hould at any future period fall into the like &s;ituation. Accordingly we &s;ailed up a &s;alt-water river, where were plenty of mullets, and a young chicken turtle; and as the water in this region was amazingly &s;hallow, not more than two feet, we cha&s;ed tho&s;e fi&s;h backwards and forwards till we cha&s;ed them out of breath, and withal, into about &s;ix inches water, which opportunity we nimbly embraced, in falling flat upon our brea&s;ts, and catching them with|out any tackle.</P>
<P>We &s;ecured the chicken turtle after the &s;ame man|ner, and ha&s;tened to Terra-firma, with a de&s;ign to cook all our acqui&s;itions; and notwith&s;tanding we could
<PB N="44" REF="47">
get neither fire or candle, yet Mr. Sims produced a tinder-box, and &s;triking fire to the tinder, applied a &s;mall piece thereof to &s;ome dry gra&s;s, gave it a few &s;hakes into the air, till it was kindled into a &s;ub&s;tantial fire. We then barbaqued the young turtle, and boiled a mullet. Still we were at a lo&s;s to obtain fre&s;hwater, and a&s;ked Mr. Sims if he could procure us any. He only &s;cratched and troubled the &s;and rather above high|water mark, and, to our a&s;toni&s;hment, the fre&s;h water &s;prung up. After we had regaled our&s;elves, captain Sims conveyed us from that region, in his turtle-boat, to the reef of rocks, whereon our &s;hip was ca&s;t away. By this time the &s;eamen of captain Bean's Potomack had well nigh equipped her, and tarried only for the return of their pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>When we were all on board, the liberal captain openly di&s;tributed all and every part of the proceeds of &s;aid cargo among the &s;ailors belonging to the wreck, and then directed his cour&s;e towards Bo&s;ton, in New-England. About three weeks after our departure from the de&s;olate i&s;land, early one morning, we di&s;|covered the Gay-Head of St. Matthias's vine yard, &s;o called from its appearance in a variety of colours, with a reef of rocks, not more than half a mile a|&s;tern of us. We came to anchor about eight o'clock in the evening, with fine plea&s;ant weather; but at ten P. M. a tremendous &s;torm aro&s;e, which cau&s;ed the &s;ea to roar dreadfully, and run mountains high.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="48">Preci&s;ely at twelve o'clock, as I had the watch upon deck, a very heavy &s;ea broke again&s;t our bow, which &s;trained the &s;hip exceedingly: I ha&s;tily ran to the companion hatchway to call another upon the guard, but &s;u&s;pecting the violent &s;ea to have had a dangerous tendency on the &s;hip, went immediately to the deep|&s;ea lead, took and hove it over the &s;tern, to judge whether &s;he was riding &s;afe at her anchors or not, but found the lead was under her bottom. I ran to the hatchway, called all hands, and informed them the ve&s;&s;el was adrift.</P>
<P>Captain Bean, of the &s;loop, &s;aid, in a very &s;olemn manner, "Then the Lord have mercy on our &s;ouls, we are every one lo&s;t," and immediately the ve&s;&s;el came down with &s;uch vehemency upon the rocks, that when the waves returned, they were high even up to our gunnel above the water, the &s;ea driving us upon them with &s;uch a power, that nothing but the omni|potence of God could have pre&s;erved us from the im|minent danger. The &s;ea &s;till continued with the utmo&s;t rapidity, and followed us like rolling moun|tains even to the beach, which da&s;hed the &s;loop &s;o violently upon and again&s;t the rocks, that we enter|tained no other ideas of the con&s;equence, but that &s;he would be broke in a thou&s;and pieces. In this &s;ituation I pulled off my frock and drawers, which was all the Spaniards had left me, and all the covering I had in the world; the next wave that attacked us, wa&s;hed
<PB N="46" REF="49">
them over-board, and left me completely de&s;titute of clothing of any kind whatever; nor was it in the power of any per&s;on on board to afford me any kind of re|lief. However, when we were upon the deck, I pro|po&s;ed to three more on board that could &s;wim tolerably well, to plunge our&s;elves over-board, and attempt to gain the &s;hore, per&s;uaded that, if this plan could be effected, a method might be taken to &s;ave the lives of tho&s;e on board, who otherwi&s;e mu&s;t have been drowned. Accordingly four of us ca&s;t our&s;elves over|board, and endeavoured to &s;wim on &s;hore; but in the attempt we were carried backwards out of our depths by a raging &s;urf; nor could we get firm foot|ing on the &s;andy beach till the wave had &s;pent it&s;elf. At length, after having our bodies dangerou&s;ly hurt, and driven about by every &s;ucceeding wave, we got &s;afe on &s;hore, and hailed the others on board the wreck to &s;end a rope on &s;hore, in order to haul them one by one to land. They did &s;o, and we re&s;cued every poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed companion of ours from the re|mor&s;ele&s;s deep. After this, they unanimou&s;ly con&s;ented to travel a little way into the country, and almo&s;t compelled me to go with them, naked as I was; but I very reluctantly declined it, owing to &s;hame and confu&s;ion; and while the others were ran&s;acking the i&s;land in que&s;t of provi&s;ion, &amp;c. I was &s;olitarily be|wailing my deplorable and haple&s;s &s;tate between two &s;mall rocks, and almo&s;t &s;tarved with hunger and cold. At &s;even o'clock in the evening, it being du&s;k, one of
<PB N="47" REF="50">
our men came running towards me, and compelled me to go to a tavern with him, which was at the di&s;tance of &s;even miles. I a&s;ked him if he had brought me any thing to cover me. He replied, No; but that there was &s;peedy help for it. I readily complied with his de&s;ires, but with much difficulty reached the tavern at midnight. The me&s;&s;enger went in, and informed the ho&s;t of my ca&s;e, who brought me out a pair of red breeches, which was all he had left after &s;upplying the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Ebenezer Allen, governor of the i&s;land, and who dwelt about &s;ix miles from the tavern, hearing of our di&s;tre&s;s, made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to relieve us; and when he arrived at the tavern (accompanied by his two elde&s;t &s;ons) he took captain Seaborn, his black &s;ervant, Jo&s;eph and my&s;elf, through partiality, and e&s;corted us home to his own hou&s;e. Between eleven and twelve at night we reached the governor's man&s;ion. All of us a&s;hamed to be &s;een, would fain have hid our|&s;elves in any dark hole or corner, as it was a truly magnificent building, with wings on each &s;ide there|of; but, to our a&s;toni&s;hment! we were received into the great parlour, where were &s;itting by the fire-&s;ide two fine portly ladies attending the &s;pit, which was burthened with a heavy quarter of hou&s;e lamb.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving a large mahogany table to be &s;pread with a fine dama&s;k cloth, and every knife, fork and plate, to be laid in a genteel mode, I was apprehen|&s;ive
<PB N="48" REF="51">
that it was intended for the entertainment of &s;ome per&s;ons of note and di&s;tinction; or, at lea&s;t, for a family &s;upper. In a &s;hort time-the joint was taken up and laid on the table, yet nobody &s;at down to eat; and as we were almo&s;t hid in one cor|ner of the room, the ladies turned round and &s;aid, "Poor men, why don't you come to &s;upper?" I replied, "Madam, we had no idea that it was pre|pared for us!" The ladies then intreated us to eat without any kind of fear of them, a&s;&s;uring us that it was prepared for none others; and none of us having eaten any thing for near &s;ix-and-thirty hours before, we picked the bones of the whole quarter; to which we had plenty of rich good cyder to drink. After &s;up|per we went to bed, and enjoyed &s;o pro&s;ound a &s;leep, that the next morning it was difficult for the old gen|tleman to awake us.</P>
<P>The following day I became a partaker of &s;everal &s;econd-hand garments, and as I was happily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a little learning, it cau&s;ed me to be more abund|antly care&s;&s;ed by the whole family, and therefore I "fared &s;umptuou&s;ly every day." This unexpected change of circum&s;tance and diet, I undoubtedly experi|enced in a very uncommon manner; but as I was &s;trict|ly trained up a Churchman, and could not &s;upport the idea of a Di&s;&s;enter (although, God knows, I had well nigh by this time di&s;&s;ented from all that was truly good) this proved a bar to my promotion, and my &s;trong propen&s;ity to &s;ail for England, to &s;ee my mo|ther,
<PB N="49" REF="52">
prevented my acceptance of the greate&s;t offer I ever received in my life before; for when the day came that we were to quit the i&s;land, and to cro&s;s the Sound over to a town called Sandwich (on the Main Continent) the young e&s;quire took me apart from my a&s;&s;ociates, and earne&s;tly intreated me to tarry with them; &s;aying, that if I would accede to their propo&s;als, nothing &s;hould be lacking to render my &s;ituation equivalent with that of the family.</P>
<P>As there were very few white men on the i&s;land, I was fixed upon (if willing) to e&s;pou&s;e one of the governor's daughters: I have been informed that the governor was immen&s;ely rich, having on the i&s;land two thou&s;and head of cattle, and twenty thou&s;and &s;heep, and every acre of land thereon belonging to him&s;elf. However, I could not be prevailed upon to accept the offer; therefore the governor furni&s;hed us with 40s. each, and gave us a pa&s;s over to the town of Sandwich.&mdash;Upon our arrival there, we waited on a Mr. Silas Bourn, ju&s;tice of the peace, who treated us courteou&s;ly, ordered us to &s;ign our names to a cer|tain document, which he purpo&s;ed to tran&s;mit over a large canal to the keeper of a tavern, whereby we could have every thing we wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P>After taking our leave of ju&s;tice Bourn, we &s;et out for Plymouth, which, we were informed, was the fir&s;t &s;pot whereon the Americans landed when they fir&s;t went over to inhabit tho&s;e parts of the world. It ap|peared
<PB N="50" REF="53">
a low mean place, with only a &s;mall &s;pired meeting-hou&s;e, which they built, and covered in with &s;hingles before they had rai&s;ed one dwelling-hou&s;e: Such was their zeal for the glory of God! We pa&s;&s;ed through this tract of land without a main road to guide us, till we came to a wood. The woods in this part of the world are no ways &s;imilar to tho&s;e in England with briars and thorns; but are variegated with num|berle&s;s rows of tall pines, which naturally grow at a tolerable di&s;tance from one another, &s;o that they bear a greater re&s;emblance to a gentleman's park, and form a beautiful appearance. We continued travelling till it began to grow dark, and finding no hou&s;e in our way &s;ince we left Plymouth, we concluded that we mu&s;t pitch our tent in the woods all night. However, at about &s;even o'clock, we fell in with a &s;mall public-hou&s;e. After we had &s;upped, I craved the ho&s;pitality of an old Engli&s;hman in providing a bed for each of us; but he very roughly expre&s;t his di&s;approbation thereof, &s;eeing we were intire &s;trangers.</P>
<P>As we were ju&s;t about to commence our nocturnal journey, a poor woman ran up to us, and in&s;i&s;ted upon our returning to her quarters, where we &s;hould be ho&s;pitably accommodated with every thing that was &s;uitable to our &s;ituation for that night. This being the fir&s;t of November, and the winter in that &s;outhern hemi&s;phere being ju&s;t &s;et in, we were, whil&s;t by the fire, almo&s;t burnt on one &s;ide, but nearly frozen on the other. As &s;oon as day-light appeared we aro&s;e,
<PB N="51" REF="54">
took our leave of the old woman, after returning her many thanks, &s;et out upon our journey, and at half pa&s;t eleven, A. M. we all reached the beautiful town of Hanover. Here the buildings and &s;tructures (from one end thereof to the other) were truly magnificent and hand&s;ome. The inhabitants were really polite, wealthy, and of a beautiful com|plexion, mien and deportment.</P>
<P>At the north we&s;t part of the town was a very fine road, which extended it&s;elf to the &s;ea &s;hore. In the center of which road &s;tands a &s;tately church, very aptly &s;ituated for the purpo&s;e of travellers, who frequently have recour&s;e thereto, and intermit their journey on Sabbath-Days. One Sunday, as my companions and &s;elf were cro&s;&s;ing the church-yard, at the time of di|vine &s;ervice, a well dre&s;t gentleman came out of the church, and &s;aid to us, "Gentlemen, we do not &s;uffer any per&s;on in this country to travel on the Lord's-Day." We gave him to under&s;tand, that it was nece&s;&s;ity which con&s;trained us to walk that way, as we were all &s;hip-wrecked on St. Martin's Vineyard, and were journeying to Bo&s;ton. The gentleman was &s;till di&s;&s;atisfied, but quitted our company, and went into the church. When we had gone a little farther, a large white hou&s;e proved the object of our attention; the door being wide open, we rea&s;onably imagined it was not in an unguarded &s;tate, without &s;ervants or others; but as we all went into the kitchen, nobody appeared to be within, nor was there an individual either above
<PB N="52" REF="55">
or below. However, I advi&s;ed my companions to tarry in the hou&s;e until &s;ome per&s;on or other &s;hould arrive. They did &s;o, and in a &s;hort time afterwards two ladies, richly dre&s;t, with a footman following them, came in through the kitchen, and notwith&s;tand|ing they turned round and &s;aw us (who in &s;o dirty and di&s;agreeable a garb and appearance, might have ter|rified them exceedingly) yet neither of them was ob&s;erved to take any notice of us, nor did either of them a&s;k us any que&s;tions, touching the cau&s;e of &s;o great an intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>About a quarter of an hour afterwards a footman entered the kitchen with the cloth, and a large two|quart &s;ilver tankard full of rich cyder; al&s;o a loaf and chee&s;e, but we not knowing it was prepared for us, did not attempt to partake thereof. At length the ladies, coming into the kitchen, and viewing us in our former po&s;ition, de&s;ired to know the rea&s;on of our malady, &s;eeing we were not refre&s;hing our&s;elves: Whereupon I urged the others to join with me in the acceptance of &s;o ho&s;pitable a propo&s;al. After this the ladies commenced a familiar enquiry into our &s;ituation. I gave them as particular an account of every recent vici&s;&s;itude that befel us, as I was capable of, with a genuine relation of our being &s;hipwrecked, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ole rea&s;ons of our travelling into that country. Like|wi&s;e begged they would excu&s;e our impertinence, as they were already informed of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="56">We then were emboldened to a&s;k the ladies if they could furni&s;h us with a lodging that evening. They replied, it was uncertain whether our wi&s;hes could be compleated there; but that if we proceeded &s;omewhat farther, we &s;hould, doubtle&s;s, be entertained, and genteelly accommodated by their brother, a quaker, who&s;e hou&s;e was not more than the di&s;tance of &s;even miles. We thanked the ladies, and &s;et forward, and at about eight o'clock arrived at their brother's hou&s;e. Fatigued with our journey, we ha&s;tened into the par|lour, and delivered our me&s;&s;age; whereupon a gentle|man quickly gave us to under&s;tand, by his free and liberal conduct, that he was the quaker referred to by the afore&s;aid ladies, who (total &s;trangers as we were) u&s;ed us with a degree of ho&s;pitality, impo&s;&s;ible to be exceeded. Indeed, I could venture to &s;ay, that the accommodations we met with at this quaker's hou&s;e (&s;eeing they were imparted to us with &s;uch affectionate &s;ympathy) greatly outweighed tho&s;e we formerly ex|perienced.</P>
<P>After our banquet, the gentleman took us up into a fine &s;pacious bedchamber, with de&s;irable bedding, and very co&s;tly chints curtains. We enjoyed a &s;ound night's re&s;t, aro&s;e between &s;even and eight the next morning, and were entertained with a good breakfa&s;t; returned many thanks for his unre&s;trained friend&s;hip and liberality, and departed therefrom fully purpo&s;ed to direct our cour&s;e for Bo&s;ton, which was not more than &s;even miles farther. Here all the land was &s;trewed
<PB N="54" REF="57">
with plenty; their orchards were replete with apple-trees and pears. They had cyder pre&s;&s;es in the center of their orchards, and great quantities of neat cyder, and any per&s;on might become a partaker thereof for the mere trouble of a&s;king. We &s;oon entered Bo&s;ton, a commodious beautiful city, with 17 &s;pired meetings, the Di&s;&s;enting religion being then e&s;tabli&s;hed in that part of the world. I re&s;ided here for the &s;pace of &s;our months, and lodged with captain Seaborn, at deacon Town&s;end's, deacon of the north meeting, by trade a black&s;mith.</P>
<P>Nothing was wanting during our continuance there, but, on the contrary, affluence flowed in upon the in|habitants from all parts of the Continent. I need not give any de&s;cription of Bo&s;ton, as by this time the town, commerce, &s;ituation, &amp;c. are almo&s;t univer|&s;ally known to every kingdom of Europe. Here I &s;hall only make a few ob&s;ervations, touching the na|ture and di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants of that city. Their behaviour is altogether amiable, as peace|makers; and they are naturally ble&s;&s;ed with humane inclinations, together with &s;uch &s;trict order and oecono|my, as I never before ob&s;erved; nor do I ever re|member to have heard one oath uttered, or the name of the Lord mentioned, &s;ave upon a religious occa&s;ion, during the four months I tarried at that place; nor is there one lewd hou&s;e &s;uffered in the whole town, or any Sabbath-breaking. It was a plea&s;ure to buy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ell among them, becau&s;e I never found an individual
<PB N="55" REF="58">
throughout their fraternity guilty of extortion. Would to God I could &s;ay this of the inhabitants of Great-Britain!</P>
<P>Upon the arrival (at Bo&s;ton) of all our &s;eamen, they were &s;trongly recommended by the natives to &s;ue for the &s;alvage of their goods and properties, which were fortunately &s;aved out of the &s;hip Scipio; but captain Clark refu&s;ed to make us any &s;atisfaction, as his ve&s;&s;el was wrecked by waiting to take us up. Upon this circum&s;tance, a certain gentleman of that city, undertook our cau&s;e, and commenced an action again&s;t captain Clark in the Admiralty-court. The defendant &s;tood the trial, which was maintained by judge Byfield, an elderly gentleman; and after a hearing of about half an hour, the judge addre&s;&s;ed captain Clark, told him to look upon us as objects of di&s;tre&s;s, and a&s;ked him, if he thought we had not &s;uf|fered &s;ufficiently already. He therefore &s;aid, as they &s;aved the cargo of their own ve&s;&s;el, I hereby decree, that they &s;hall all, without any kind of re&s;traint, re|ceive double &s;alvage. Then, to our a&s;toni&s;hment, captain Clark, though deemed by the inhabitants a covetous and avaricious character, an&s;wered the judge with a chearful accent, that it &s;hould be &s;o; and that he would, moreover, render to each of us a pre&s;ent of ten pounds currency, exclu&s;ive of our re&s;pective &s;al|vage. Thus ended our law-&s;uit, and we had a &s;uffici|ency to fit us out with every nece&s;&s;ary article for &s;ea again.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="59">I embraced the fir&s;t opportunity for that purpo&s;e, and voluntarily &s;hipped my&s;elf on board the Allen, captain Dennis, for Antigua, in the We&s;t-Indies. I got my di&s;charge there, having a &s;trong inclination to return to my native country. Accordingly I entered into an agreement with captain Skatt, then lying in the har|bour of St. John's (the principal commercial town of Antigua) but as we were tarrying there, in order to ob|tain a freig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t for England, there came on a very ter|rible hurricane; and although it was exce&s;&s;ively vio|lent during its continuance, and drove us out of the harbour into the Offing, yet we providentially &s;u&s;tained but very little damage; and notwith&s;tanding the &s;hip was intirely unrigged (&s;ave a jury forema&s;t) yet, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that, and the immediate providence of God, we reached, in the &s;pace of eight days, the har|bour of St. John's again. When we had taken in part of our homeward-bound merchandize, the &s;hip was, by virtue of a &s;pecial document from the governor of &s;aid i&s;land, tran&s;mitted to the i&s;land of Mont&s;errat, about ten leagues to leeward of Antigua; there, to procure the re&s;idue of our cargo, and fini&s;h the lading thereof.</P>
<P>This i&s;land chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of numerous lofty and barren mountains, with an unnavigable harbour, ren|dered &s;o by a multiplicity of &s;mall &s;harp-pointed rocks, &s;everal whereof, at ebb-tide, are one, two, or more feet above the water. There is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ikewi&s;e a very mean and incon&s;iderable town, which maintains little or no
<PB N="57" REF="60">
corre&s;pondence with others in the adjacent i&s;lands: The name of this town is Ba&s;&s;eterre, and it is &s;ituated in view of the i&s;lands of Nevis, St. Chri&s;topher, and Guardaloupe. Here another difficulty followed us, as we were nece&s;&s;itated to travel &s;even or eight miles over various rocks, and through many vallies, in order to get fire-wood, called Manchanell; which is one of the mo&s;t beautiful trees probably in the known world, and bears an apple, the odours whereof are not unlike our Engli&s;h golden rennets, and of an equal form and &s;ize; but it is one of the ranke&s;t poi&s;ons, root, body, branches, leaves, and fruit. I remember when I fir&s;t went to Jamaica, at a place called Littleworth, one of tho&s;e kind of trees was planted, which grew full of fruit, and &s;pread its branches and leaves as wide as our great walnut-trees in England. I &s;imply knocked down one of the apples, and ignorant of the con&s;equence, was going to eat it (as it was plea&s;ing to the eye) when a black man, ob&s;erving my heedle&s;s actions, ran with uncommon &s;wiftne&s;s towards me, and in a cautious hurry, &s;natched it from my hand, giving me at the &s;ame time to under&s;tand, that if I had eaten it, all my teeth would have fallen out of my head, and that with|out any kind of remedy; and further, he told me, that if any per&s;on was to &s;tand under that tree in a &s;hower of rain, the drops i&s;&s;uing therefrom, and falling on any part of the &s;kin, would take it clearly off. As our men were cutting tho&s;e trees for fire-wood at Mont&s;errat, they had their eyes clo&s;ed and &s;welled in &s;o dreadful a manner, that we were apprehen&s;ive they
<PB N="58" REF="61">
never could retrieve their natural &s;ight; but, I think, they &s;everally recovered in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>When the &s;hip was compleatly ready for &s;ailing we weighed our anchor, and &s;ailed for Bri&s;tol, where we arrived after a &s;even weeks pa&s;&s;age; and, after a peaceable retirement for a few weeks, I &s;hipped my&s;elf with captain James Seaborn for a &s;econd voyage with him, in the &s;hip Amoretta, for Old Callabar, on the Coa&s;t of Africa, and the i&s;land of Barbadoes, one of the Caribbe or We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands. Here I began to be prefered, being made gunner of the &s;hip; and when we were &s;laved the &s;hip &s;ailed for Barbadoes; but was &s;peedily ordered for South-Carolina, there to di&s;|po&s;e of our &s;laves, which we did, to our &s;atisfaction, in a few days, and were &s;oon reladen; then, without any delay, &s;teered our cour&s;e with a &s;trong though de|lightful gale to the Bri&s;tol channel. Nothing remarka|ble occurred in the cour&s;e of this voyage. On coming to England I betook my&s;elf to Barn&s;taple in Devon, where dwelt a brother of mine, who kept a genteel &s;hop there. I continued with him for &s;everal days, then repaired to Bri&s;tol again, accompanied by my brother, and from thence &s;et off for London to vi&s;it my mother, whom I had not &s;een for ten years pa&s;t. My family being in low circum&s;tances, I was obliged to go again to &s;ea, and the fir&s;t trip was in a coa&s;ting &s;loop to Wi&s;beach, with a captain John Heath. When I returned, I &s;hipped my&s;elf with captain Thomas
<PB N="59" REF="62">
Long, in the &s;hip Ann and Judith, for Antigua. When I had made this voyage al&s;o, I covenanted with cap|tain Rogers for a voyage up the Mediterranean. His &s;hip was Iaden with 280 quarters of corn, upon char|ter-party, to three delivering ports, viz. Mar&s;eilles, Genoa and Leghorn. In the cour&s;e of this ea&s;tern voyage we &s;u&s;tained various hard&s;hips, which may particularly be attributed to the perver&s;ene&s;s of our commander. We &s;ailed from the Downs in the month of January, 1733, after riding out and weathering many vehement &s;torms in that &s;ea. The whole fleet &s;ailed down Channel with very promi&s;ing weather; but before we had made any progre&s;s in our intended voyage, the wind &s;uddenly varied, and blew with &s;uch vehement rage, that the greater part of the fleet were &s;cattered, and their &s;ails blown and torn to atoms; there|fore &s;uch part thereof as could put back without danger returned to Spithead, while the others were di&s;per&s;ed abroad throughout the Channel, and driven over to the coa&s;t of France: But our captain, as before hinted, being an ob&s;tinate, though an experienced &s;eaman, and the whole &s;hip intirely his own, was determined to a&s;&s;ume that unre&s;trained pre&s;umption, which other commanders more circum&s;pectly declined. The con&s;equence was, we were beating to windward for full five weeks ince&s;|&s;antly under ree&s;ed cour&s;es, the mountainous &s;ea making continual breaches over the &s;hip; nor did the cook, or any of the &s;eamen, during that time, dre&s;s any provi&s;ions; neither had any of us the comfort of a dry thread upon our backs. One night in particular, the

wind being at north-we&s;t, attacked us &s;o violently, that the &s;hip was laid hatches under water, and the fore-&s;cuttle, where we came up, being unfortunately open, every repeated &s;ea poured it&s;elf down into the hold like &s;toods, in&s;omuch that the &s;hip was &s;unk very near two &s;treaks in the water. The captain was at the &s;ame time cur&s;ing, &s;wearing and roaring, at the &s;hip's company, like an infernal &s;pirit; and had it not been through the dexterous alacrity and nimblene&s;s of a John Stonehou&s;e, one of our &s;eamen, who ran up the weather main &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reads, and who &s;ecretly conveyed him|&s;elf under water to come at the lee-main-&s;heet, and let it go (which, as the main-&s;ail was &s;et, naturally pre&s;&s;ed the &s;hip down to leeward) we mu&s;t inevitably have foundered, and all hands, without relief, have peri&s;hed. When the main-&s;heet was let fly, the main-&s;ail went all to &s;hivers, like a clap of thunder: the fore-&s;ail then were the &s;hip round, and brought her &s;tarboard-&s;ide to the wind, which blew her upon an even keel. She lay for a long time like a log upon the waves, and having five feet water in her hold, we had immediate recour&s;e to both pumps, and in about five hours cleared her, and proceeded on our voyage. But the ob&s;tinacy of the captain occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of the cargo of whout, not one &s;ingle bu&s;hel being &s;aved out of the whole lading; and this con&s;iderable lo&s;s fell upon the configuors. As our fir&s;t port of delivery was Mar&s;eilles, in the &s;outh of France, down in the gulph of Lyons, in the Streights of Gibraltar, we went thither, and offered to the con&s;ignees there the
<PB N="61" REF="64">
cargo; but they refu&s;ed to accept thereof. This obliged us to carry it to Genoa, where it was likewi&s;e refu&s;ed. From thence we &s;teered up to Leghorn, and this being the la&s;t port of delivery, the freightor's corre&s;pondents were con&s;trained to accept of it, good or bad, agreeable to charter. When our cargo was di&s;|charged, and our &s;hip reladen, we departed for England. But before I proceed to our pa&s;&s;age for England, I would take notice of &s;ome of tho&s;e things which are worthy ob|&s;ervation in that part of Italy where we were &s;tationed.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, I never remember to have &s;een a more &s;plendid, magnificent, and fertile country in the cour&s;e of my life than this was. Here the warme&s;t of my juve|nile conceptions of foreign parts were in &s;ome mea&s;ure realized; and as at the early period of my life I had en|tertained many plea&s;ing ideas of tho&s;e places where the apo&s;tles, with &s;uch holy zeal, propagated the Go&s;pel in their travels, &s;o I found a natural propen&s;ity to &s;atisfy my&s;elf with a clear view of every remarkable thing throughout the limits of my re&s;triction while on &s;hore. In one part of Genoa I ob&s;erved two very lofty pillars of marble, built upon &s;o elevated a plan, as to be evidently perceptible from &s;hips at the di&s;tance of 12 miles at &s;ea. This is conjectured to be the gallons erected for Mord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cai the Jew, by the wicked contri|vance of Haman, and which proved fatal to Haman him&s;elf. Two things more I &s;hall notice in Genoa. The fir&s;t is the image of a man, at the back part of a gentleman's hou&s;e, &s;culptured out of a &s;olid rock,
<PB N="62" REF="65">
almo&s;t at the &s;ummit thereof, which appears to be precipitated therefrom, with his head foremo&s;t, his arms extended, and the hair of his head hanging pendant con&s;iderably below his body, and his whole frame fixed on his right foot, through which a &s;pring was convey|ed, and ran throughout the body, &s;o as to di&s;charge drops of water from the tops of his fingers and hair. Here another &s;urpri&s;ing phoenomenon attracted my notice; at the top of a pa&s;&s;age that led me to the rock, I perceived the exact repre&s;entation of a &s;tout and corpulent man, de&s;cending from the rock, which &s;eemed to threaten me with impending danger, therefore I nimbly fled out of its way, lea&s;t in its fall I &s;hould be cru&s;hed to pieces: However, the &s;tatue remained firm in that &s;urpri&s;ing attitude.</P>
<P>The next curio&s;ity was a grand arched bridge, near a mile in length, with many &s;pacious arches, and &s;treets of hou&s;es (&s;ome of them four &s;tories high) running under tho&s;e arches. This bridge, as I have been informed, was con&s;tructed for the better conveni|ence of carriages pa&s;&s;ing from the city into the coun|try, for &s;upplying the remoter natives with the nece&s;|&s;aries of life and commerce. The di&s;tance between every arch is &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive to admit of twenty carriages abrea&s;t of each other. I likewi&s;e, in the cour&s;e of my ob&s;ervations on this city, perceived that it was founded on a ba&s;is of &s;even hills, having a beautiful 'Change covered, and &s;ky-lights fixed
<PB N="63" REF="66">
around, for the better conveniency of merchants to tran&s;act their negociations.</P>
<P>At Leghorn I &s;aw nothing intere&s;ting, or of a grand appearance, except the four brazen men, who are placed in a con&s;picuous &s;ituation round a pede&s;tal. This was erected in honour of the duke of Genoa, who gloriou&s;ly defeated four notorious pirates that fre|quently di&s;turbed the Mediterranean, viz. a father and his three &s;ons; they were taken pri&s;oners by the duke in a row galley, and their &s;tatues erected in bra&s;s around the pede&s;tal, as a memorial; and on another &s;pot was placed the image of the duke &s;tanding upright, with a truncheon in his hand, and ca&s;ting an air of contempt upon the four captives, the &s;pace between the&s;e not ex|ceeding half a dozen yards. In this place there are nu|merous gallies of war, &s;upported by common pro&s;titutes and &s;trumpets tolerated by government, who have a con&s;iderable part of the city allowed them, wherein they commit all manner of abominations. I do not ever re|member to have fallen in with a city or town, in which impurity predominates over the inhabitants in &s;o li|centious a manner as in the city of Leghorn; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for either &s;ex to for&s;ake or renounce that horrid cour&s;e of life, even though they &s;hould be ever &s;o de&s;irous, or convinced of the &s;in thereof.</P>
<P>When the term of my liberty was elap&s;ed, I repaired on board our &s;hip, and in a few days we &s;ailed for England. When we arrived off the I&s;le of Wight, a
<PB N="64" REF="67">
tender which lay in the Channel to pre&s;s the homeward bound &s;eamen (a proceeding derogatory to God and man) took our &s;hip's crew, and after having been on board the tender rather upwards of a week, a divi&s;ion took place among the &s;eamen; one part was &s;ent on board the Lenox, of 70 guns, and the other part on board the Ip&s;wich, of the &s;ame force. After lying at Spit|head ten months, under the weight of an arbitrary fel|low of a lieutenant, I was removed on board the Phoenix, captain Trivil Caley, who was the complete gentleman and Chri&s;tian, and one who&s;e conduct was guided by the tear of God. He frequently encouraged religious di&s;ci|pline on board; nor did he ever neglect to order his chaplain to attend his invalid &s;eamen, at five o'clock in the morning, both at Port&s;mouth and Go&s;port, and would con&s;tantly vi&s;it every patient re&s;pectively, on his knees, at their bed&s;ides, with all the devotion be|coming a Chri&s;tian. Never was a commander &s;o care&s;&s;ed by a &s;hip's company as captain Caley, and his men were equally endeared to him. So intirely cautious was he before he &s;poke to any man on board, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, that he even drew the attention of &s;trangers; for my part I could never look at him, but with uncommon &s;atisfaction and delight: In &s;hort, his mildne&s;s, &s;apience and fortitude, greatly &s;urpa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e characters I had ever admired before in my life! Happy, truly happy it proved for me, that I providentially fell in with &s;o worthy a Chri&s;tian; otherwi&s;e, what with the hell of uncommon cur&s;es and bla&s;phemous oaths, accompanied by an habitual cour&s;e
<PB N="65" REF="68">
of cruel and barbarous behaviour, on the parts of two lieutenants, I mu&s;t have died under my burthen, as the idea of a man of war was ever perfectly di&s;ta&s;teful to my inclination. At that time I was grievou&s;ly op|pre&s;&s;ed with the rheumati&s;m: However, early one morning, God undertook my cau&s;e, and I began thus to rea&s;on with my&s;elf: The rheumati&s;m! What is it? and it was &s;trongly &s;ugge&s;ted to me in a manner not unlike a clear voice, "It is a violent cold." I then, with great a&s;toni&s;hment, a&s;ked, what is mo&s;t proper as a remedy for the cold? I was an&s;wered as before, "Spring water." The rea&s;on of this I could not comprehend; and a&s;ked again, Why &s;pring water? The an&s;wer to me (clear as a &s;trong voice) was, "Man was created out of the du&s;t of the earth, and water &s;prings out of the bowels of the earth, therefore it is the more adapted to his nature." At this I was &s;atisfied, and &s;traightway called for a man, who&s;e name was Tom Lewis, who came immediately, and a&s;ked me what I wanted. I reque&s;ted him to procure, from &s;ome part of the &s;hip, five or &s;ix &s;hirts, and air them &s;ufficiently at the fire-&s;ide: I told him al&s;o to fill a large pitcher full of water, and bring it in&s;tantly to me, and I would drink till I could drink no more, as I believed the Lord had directed me to a cure, by taking a hearty draught of &s;pring water. He endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade me from &s;o ha&s;ty an action, a&s;&s;uring me, that its operation would &s;urely kill me in my then pre&s;ent condition: "Notwith&s;tanding," added he, "if you are bent upon taking it, I will get it quickly." He did &s;o,
<PB N="66" REF="69">
and compleated my de&s;ires. I then drank immediately of the &s;pring water, laid my&s;elf down on the bed, and Tom covered me up very warm. After I had lain about the &s;pace of half an hour, with no appearance of the water's operation, I put my head under the cloaths, and breathed hard on the pit of my &s;tomach; this produced a per&s;piration, and that in a profu&s;e mea&s;ure. I then de&s;ired my attendant to bring me half a dozen well-dried and warm &s;lannels, in order to rub me from head to foot: He did this likewi&s;e, and continued his rubbing till I had made five &s;hirts in a condition equal to the dipping of them in water. When I had put on my &s;ixth dry &s;hirt, I gave Thomas to under&s;tand, that I was totally exempt from every the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of the rheumati&s;m and pain; in|&s;tantly jumped out of bed, dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf without his aid, and a&s;ked him what was for dinner below. He replied, "Salt-fi&s;h and potatoes;" and although I had not enjoyed one meal for eight or ten weeks before, yet I went down, and made as hearty a meal as I ever remember to have eat in my life, and then walked the di&s;tance of a mile on &s;hore, by way of recreation. Here I con&s;idered that nothing was impo&s;&s;ible to him who had all power in heaven and in earth. Two or three days after this I was pro|nounced "Able," and went on board the Lenox, the &s;hip I formerly belonged to. My &s;everal indi&s;po&s;itions began in the month of January, 1734, and accompa|nied me with direful pangs and &s;en&s;ations, till the latter end of April following.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="70">On the Chri&s;tmas-Eve, in the cour&s;e of my liberty, I e&s;pou&s;ed Mary Verney, a very virtuous young wo|man, in the twenty-&s;econd year of her age. At that time I was in my twenty-third year. After remaining on board the &s;hip for two months, orders were &s;ent down to Sir John Norris, on board the Britannia, a fir&s;t-rate of 100 guns, with the union flag at his main-top-ma&s;t-head; the Barflour, admiral Balchan, of 90 guns, and blue flag at the fore-top-ma&s;t-head; and the Lanca&s;ter, of So guns, admiral Haddock, with St. George's flag at his fore-top-ma&s;t-head, to|gether with twenty-five &s;ail of the line, to &s;ail imme|diately for Li&s;bon, in order to protect the king of Portugal's Brazilian fleet from the threats of the Spaniards. Here my&s;elf, with &s;everal others, were turned over from the Lenox on board the Grafton, of 70 guns, and &s;ailed, in company with the fleet, for Li&s;bon, and arrived in the Tagus &s;ome time in the month of May, 1735, where we lay ten months at anchor, in which time the Brazil fleet arrived, and orders were &s;ent from England for admiral Haddock's &s;quadron to return thither. Previous to our departure from Li&s;bon the king of Portugal, with his brother; the black prince, came on board of all three admirals, who&s;e &s;hips were dre&s;t in various colours, con&s;i&s;ting of all nations in the world, and making a very brilliant appearance. His Portugue&s;e maje&s;ty allowed every man and boy in the fleet one pint of wine per day, with fre&s;h provi&s;ions every day till the completion of our voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="71">We &s;ailed for England in the beginning of January, 1736, and arrived off the rocks of Scilly the latter end of the &s;ame month, where our &s;hip was well nigh lo&s;t, it being indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for us to beat to windward under reefe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cour&s;es; but, thank God, we were pre&s;erved in this &s;torm al&s;o, and arrived &s;afe in Chatham river, where we were paid off, February 6, 1736. I then came directly to London, nor have I ever been to &s;ea &s;ince. I could wi&s;h to make one re|mark here, which I have omitted in the cour&s;e of my voyages. The coa&s;t of Africa is attended every day (e&s;pecially on the leeward coa&s;t) with dreadful tornadoes of wind, thunder and lightning, the fla&s;hes of which for &s;ome time take away the &s;ight. At one time in parti|cular, about eight degrees to the &s;outhward of the equi|noctial line, at one A. M. a violent tornado came down upon us, with loud claps of thunder, and fierce fla&s;hes of lightning: In the height of this &s;torm al&s;o de&s;cended from the di&s;turbed clouds &s;omething that bore the re|&s;emblance of a &s;quib darting out fire at one end, about one foot and a half in length, and the thickne&s;s of a man's wri&s;t: It came down from the heavens with a&s;toni&s;hing velocity, pa&s;&s;ed within a yard of my head, and penetrated the quarter-deck; but meeting with an ob&s;truction of the air, made its way through the main hatchway, took a &s;wift cour&s;e over the larboard-quar|ter, and, when it bur&s;t, exploded with &s;o loud a clap of thunder, that we could not expect two planks of the &s;hip would have remained together. However, the &s;hip
<PB N="69" REF="72">
weathered this &s;torm al&s;o, but not without much da|mage, through the mighty force of the tornado.</P>
<P>I now entered into a new &s;cene of life, and altho' I had been brought up to the &s;ea, and had no friends to &s;upply my nece&s;&s;ities at home, yet I was re&s;olved, thro' the help of the Almighty, to have recour&s;e to any em|ployment, be it in never &s;o menial a calling, rather than abide in the un&s;uitable &s;tate of life I formerly did. A life attended with all manner of &s;ufferings and wick|edne&s;s in the highe&s;t degree, my ca&s;e being rather different from other &s;eamen; as God never left me without conviction, which con&s;tantly rendered my mind very unhappy, and I ever experienced grievous &s;tings of con&s;cience for the commi&s;&s;ion of any di&s;coverable &s;in. Being now in a married &s;tate, and de&s;irous to lead a regular and ob&s;ervant life, I habituated my&s;elf to the church-&s;ervice; but finding the churchmen living as did other people, and having no Chri&s;tian friend to conver&s;e with, I knew not what &s;tep to take, and therefore readily concluded, religion was a mere farce. At the &s;ame time, being &s;ubject to the weight of many temporal di&s;tre&s;&s;es, a fre&s;h burthen came upon me; yet it plea&s;ed God to point me out, in a few months, a &s;chool at Staplefoot Tauney, near Pa&s;&s;ingford Bridge, in the county of E&s;&s;ex, erected by a lady Luther, who &s;pared no pains in its building; and al&s;o be&s;towed many donations towards the &s;upport and maintenance thereof. My whole &s;alary amounted to &pound;14 per annum, ten pounds whereof was the neat
<PB N="70" REF="73">
&s;alary from the &s;chool; two pounds from lady Luther, and the like &s;um from Mr. Moot, a wealthy farmer, with as many day-&s;cholars as I could acquire for my own account. I &s;oon rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable &s;chool, and &s;ent to London for my wife, and all my goods. The lady three days in the week invited me with the cu|rate of the pari&s;h to dine with her; and every other day, if I thought proper, to accompany the &s;ervants at their dinner in Knave's-Hall, as they termed it. I now began to be much delighted with my &s;ituation, and re&s;erved no diligence to bring the children forward in their learning; indeed the &s;ucce&s;s I met with, cau&s;ed the &s;chool to be recommended throughout the country.</P>
<P>Here the curate of the pari&s;h frequently called upon me, and decoyed me to his lodgings, about three miles from the &s;chool, to join him in &s;moaking a pipe, drinking a bowl of punch, with the like carou&s;als. I was al&s;o pre&s;&s;ed upon to &s;ing him a &s;ea &s;ong, and was generally detained &s;o very late at night, that I could &s;carcely find my way home; but this life did not an|&s;wer my de&s;ires, and therefore, as the curate and my&s;elf were going from lady Luther's over the fields to my &s;chool, I took upon my&s;elf to quote &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, relating to our immoral proceedings. My guide, or pretended one, laughed heartily, and &s;aid, "Told, are you &s;o great a blockhead as to believe the Scripture? It is nothing but a pack of fal&s;e theology, the whole of it." This &s;urpri&s;ed me much, and from
<PB N="71" REF="74">
that period I &s;eparated my&s;elf from his company; and God, in his providence, di&s;united me from tho&s;e dead and barren Chri&s;tians, by the following &s;imple circum|&s;tance.</P>
<P>The wood I had be&s;poke for firing not coming in, as I expected, I acquainted farmer Mills, on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide of the church-yard, who gave me leave to &s;end my boys into his field, where they might be able to collect a quantity &s;ufficient for my u&s;e until the be|&s;poken fire-wood came in; and &s;eeing it was on the farmer's own ground, I had no conceptions of any impropriety of conduct on my part; yet this, through the in&s;inuative complaint of an old woman (who ever before expre&s;t the &s;incere&s;t regard for my&s;elf and wife) proved the cau&s;e of my removal out of the &s;chool and country. Sir Edward Smith, then lord of the manor, &s;ent for lady Luther, and de&s;ired to know what kind of a &s;choolma&s;ter &s;he had brought into the country, and whether he ever taught his children their catechi&s;m. My lady informed me that Sir Edward greatly &s;ur|pri&s;ed her; but &s;he an&s;wered him, that I bore the be&s;t characters, and had brought the children forward in their education in an extraordinary manner, and that I taught the children their catechi&s;m every Thur&s;day. Sir Edward then a&s;ked, how I came to leave out the eighth commandment; therefore in&s;i&s;ted upon my di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion from the &s;chool, and departure from the town immediately; nor would he hear the circum&s;tance face to face, &s;o that I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of hiring a
<PB N="72" REF="75">
waggon to carry all my goods back to London; and was then at a lo&s;s what method to pur&s;ue for the main|tenance of my family; but in a &s;hort time a clerk's place offered at King's-Wharf, Beaufort's-Buildings, to a dealer in coals and timber. I remained there about four months, when my mi&s;tre&s;s leaving off bu&s;i|ne&s;s, I was nece&s;&s;arily di&s;charged, and was left de&s;ti|tute of employment for &s;ome time; nor could I obtain any relief, or procure the lea&s;t employ, from any quarter thereabouts, &s;o was re&s;olved to &s;ubmit to any the meane&s;t office to procure a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and accord|ingly engaged my&s;elf to a Mr. Medway, a bricklayer, in Watling-&s;treet, to keep his books, and at vacant opportunities to attend and wait on the labou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers. Here I continued about &s;ix or &s;even years, and after|wards &s;erved Mr. John Pankeman, a bricklayer like|wi&s;e; but in the cour&s;e of my &s;ervices with him, God began a different providence with me, and one day, as labouring at my work in Old-Street Road, a young man, who was likewi&s;e a bricklayer, came and a&s;ked me if I could help him to bu&s;ine&s;s. I an&s;wered him rather roughly, which he received with great meek|ne&s;s; this &s;truck me with &s;urpri&s;e: I then called him back, and de&s;ired him to wait on a certain ma&s;ter bricklayer, at an appointed place the next morning, who, I was apt to believe, could find him employ|ment. He repaired thereto accordingly, and the gen|tleman, without a&s;king him any que&s;tions, admitted him into his &s;ervice. This young man was the in&s;trument, in the hand of God, of leading me
<PB N="73" REF="76">
out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light. Here my readers will permit me to enter upon my religious life, and therefore I think it prudent to revert back to my earlie&s;t days; and as I have already in the begin|ning &s;et forth the manner and my&s;tery of God's work|ing upon my &s;oul, to the time of my admi&s;&s;ion into Edward Col&s;on's Ho&s;pital, &s;o I &s;hall occa&s;ionally in|ter&s;per&s;e my changes of &s;tation in this life, as well as tho&s;e of a &s;piritual nature.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t was admitted into &s;chool, between two extremes, that of parting with my tender-hearted nur&s;e, and being driven into a new &s;cene of life, I was brought under much di&s;tre&s;s of mind; yet I con&s;tantly found the Spirit of God working powerfully upon me; nor could I ever find peace or re&s;t but when meditating on things divine. My thoughts, when at prayers in the &s;chool three times every day, were carried up into heaven, with the mo&s;t &s;olemn ardent de&s;ire; and when we a&s;&s;embled in the college church, which we regu|larly did every Sabbath-Day, the &s;ervice there was to me a heaven upon earth. Here I drank deep into the bli&s;s and happine&s;s of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed and adorable Je&s;us, and that without interruption, till I arrived at the age of ten years, by which time I had made &s;ome proficiency in learning, and was approved of by the mini&s;ter, who came twice a week to in&s;truct us in re|ligious principles; &s;o that in a &s;hort time I was com|petent (by readily an&s;wering him any que&s;tions pro|pounded)
<PB N="74" REF="77">
to be intitled a monitor. I then began to read pious books, e&s;pecially the Pilgrim's Progre&s;s. This &s;et me on fire for God and heavenly bli&s;s, and wrought in me the utmo&s;t horror of taking the Lord's name in vain, or of telling a lye; and as there were a few lads in the &s;ame order as my&s;elf, that were piou&s;ly inclined, &s;o we often read the Pilgrim's Pro|gre&s;s together. On a Lord's-Day in particular, being at the college church, the reverend Mr. Sutton preached a very alarming di&s;cour&s;e upon the deep things of eter|nity, to a wanton crouded congregation. The fa&s;hion was then for the women to go naked-brea&s;ted; nor was there &s;carce a woman to be found in the college but appeared in the mo&s;t indecent manner; yet the di&s;cour&s;e in a great mea&s;ure effected its de&s;ign; neither do I ever remember to have &s;een any thing of that kind in Bri&s;tol afterwards. Many of our boys were deeply affected by the &s;ermon, &s;o that when we came home to &s;chool, &s;everal of us entered into an agree|ment to pinch the tongue of him that told a lye, or that mentioned the Lord's name in an irreverent way.</P>
<P>When I was about twelve years of age I was more profoundly acquainted with divine things, but not with my&s;elf as a &s;inner. Sitting one day in my order, and reading the Pilgrim's Progre&s;s, I &s;uddenly laid down the book, leaned my right elbow on my right knee, with my hand &s;upporting my head, and medi|tated
<PB N="75" REF="78">
in the mo&s;t &s;olemn thought, upon the awfulne&s;s of eternity: Suddenly I was &s;truck with a hand on the top of my head, which affected my whole frame; the blow was immediately followed by a voice with the&s;e words, "Dark! dark! dark!" and although it alarmed me prodigiou&s;ly, yet, upon the recovery from &s;o &s;udden a motion, I found my&s;elf broad awake in a world of &s;in. Notwith&s;tanding all my former happi|ne&s;s and bli&s;s, I now found a dreadful difference, as nothing could give me &s;atisfaction, either from per&s;on or things; not could I ever re&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atisfied about my &s;alva|tion, as temptation from the world, the fle&s;h and the devil, were ever be&s;etting me.</P>
<P>One day, the boys being permitted to go to vi&s;it their friends, I obtained permi&s;&s;ion likewi&s;e, although I had no relation or friend in the city, my mother and two &s;i&s;ters re&s;iding in London, and my two elder bro|thers re&s;iding in the country. However, &s;everal of the boys accompanied me that afternoon to go to a river, called Broad-Stony, near the city, for the pur|po&s;e of learning to &s;wim; and, as I was &s;trongly de|&s;irous of learning that art, &s;everal of the &s;maller boys, with my&s;elf, went into a pond adjoining to that river, which received the overflowing thereof. It being low water, I ventured rather beyond the others; but in attempting to &s;wim, &s;truck out of my depth, and was for &s;ome time &s;truggling for life. My companions, who &s;at upon the bank on the other &s;ide the river, imagined I was taking my &s;port and pa&s;time, by rea|&s;on
<PB N="76" REF="79">
of my ri&s;ing above water and diving under again; therefore had no conceptions that I was on the verge of being drowned, till they perceived that I gave a dart, &s;unk, and they could &s;ee me no more. At this they were all terribly affrighted, and in the utmo&s;t con&s;ter|nation, not knowing what to do; but de&s;crying &s;ome haymakers at the farther end of the meadow, they ran with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, and informed them that a boy was drowned. Providentially there was a Dutch|man among the haymakers, who, upon hearing the &s;ad news, threw down his hay-fork, ran to the river|&s;ide, enquired of the others where I was perceived to &s;ink, and, upon as near an information as could po&s;&s;i|bly be given, he jumped in without pulling off any of his cloaths. He then &s;earched and groped about for a con&s;iderable time, but I could not be found, as in the dart I had &s;hot a great di&s;tance from the &s;pot where the children perceived me to &s;ink. I was now given up for lo&s;t; but as the Dutchman was &s;wimming to the bank where a willow-bu&s;h grew out at the &s;ide, in order to haul him&s;elf out of the pond, he felt about with one of his legs ju&s;t before he came to the bank, and as my head was covered in the mud, with my heels upright, &s;o he providentially &s;truck his foot again&s;t mine, and joyfully gave the &s;ignal that I was found. He went down, brought me up, and landed me on the bank; but not the lea&s;t &s;igns of life were di&s;cernible in me. The Dutchman held me with my heels up|wards for &s;ome minutes, and then concluded my life was irretrievably gone; yet it entered into his
<PB N="77" REF="80">
mind to try another method: Accordingly he &s;wam acro&s;s the river, and went a little way up the hill, where there was a &s;mall alehou&s;e. He got from thence a quartern of brandy, and &s;wam over the river back again into the meadow, holding up the brandy in one hand, and &s;wimming with the other. My jaws were firmly &s;et together, nor was there any motion or breath to be perceived; yet he put &s;ome brandy into his mouth, forced my jaws open, and blew repeatedly half a quartern of &s;pirits down my throat: He al&s;o blew &s;ome up my no&s;trils, and into my ears, and in about three quarters of an hour my left-eye flew open, and I gave a loud &s;hriek. They then carried me to Bapti&s;t-Mills, where, in about four hours, I recovered my &s;en&s;es, &s;o as to have a faint knowledge of one or two of the boys: The&s;e were the immediate accounts of all tran&s;actions as they related them to me.</P>
<P>I was then conveyed home to the &s;chool, but with an excruciating pain, equal to the being out through in the middle of my body; nor did I enjoy an ex|emption therefrom for &s;everal years together; neither do I remember a &s;ingle twelvemonth, for a dozen years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, but that this pain produced two, three, or more fits of &s;ickne&s;s every year, and many of them brought me near the grave. When I went to &s;chool, Mr. Samuel Gardner, the principal ma&s;ter of the ho&s;|pital, having been informed of the circum&s;tance, puni&s;hed me &s;everely, as a &s;trict charge had been de|livered by him that none of us &s;hould go near the
<PB N="78" REF="81">
water, one of his &s;cholars having been drowned &s;ome time ago, and who never recovered.</P>
<P>I hope my readers will &s;u&s;pend their judgment, in cen&s;uring what I am now about to relate, although it may appear rather incredible: I &s;hall then, in the mo&s;t &s;imple and artle&s;s manner treat of what was as real to my &s;en&s;ations, as that I ever had an exi&s;tence. The circum&s;tance was this: Although I was deprived of my natural &s;en&s;es, and had no ideas of the things of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s world, yet my &s;pirit was permitted by God both to behold and experience that which, I believe, no one in the body ever did. My entrance into this bli&s;sful vi&s;ion, as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ared to me, was, that I ru&s;hingly emerged out of thick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s into a mo&s;t glorious city; the lu&s;tre of which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r out&s;hone the brilliancy of the noon-day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the brightne&s;s thereof tran&s;cends the glimmer|ing ray<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the moon.

There was al&s;o &s;ome re&s;emblance of a bot|tom, or f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oor, like unto gla&s;s, but neither the city or bottom were of any &s;ub&s;tance. The inhabitants were
<PB N="79" REF="82">
all in the form of men, arrayed in robes of the fine&s;t quality, from their necks down to their feet; yet they al&s;o appeared to me of no material &s;ub&s;tance. What particularly courted my attention was, that not one of the&s;e cele&s;tial bodies were under any degree of labour to walk, as they all glided &s;wiftly along, as if carried by the wind. This was my own ca&s;e, clothed in the fine&s;t of linen, and conveyed with the like celerity. No &s;peech or language was needful there, as they were all one &s;oul. The &s;olemn, &s;acred joy, and uninter|rupted peace, I then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, all language fails me to point out: I had no imaginations of evil, or any temptations thereto, but was completely happy without mixture.</P>
<P>Another point of this vi&s;ion I would ju&s;t remark before I clo&s;e the &s;ubject, that is, while tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits were performing their aerial cour&s;e, one of them about 50 yards off, on my right-hand, turned round, and looked &s;tedfa&s;tly at my raiment: We both &s;ud|denly &s;topt, and the extacies which proceeded from his countenance, united us together as one. Oh! who can expre&s;s the &s;weet, plea&s;ant, and &s;erene tranquility (then enjoyed! But, on a &s;udden, I lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of this very de&s;irable &s;tate, and clearly apprehended my being brought again into a &s;inful world; the coming into which was as through a devouring ocean of blood and fire. This was the &s;equel and conclu&s;ion of that awful di&s;pen&s;ation of the righteous God to me, well knowing how he had di&s;po&s;ed of me for many years
<PB N="80" REF="83">
pa&s;t, that I might be made perfect through &s;ufferings, and drink deep into this cup, and be baptized with his bapti&s;m. As to my external &s;ufferings, they are prin|cipally &s;et forth in the foregoing part of this nar|rative.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e already hinted at my being particu|larly convinced of &s;in, by reading the Pilgrim's Pro|gre&s;s, yet the Spirit of God never left me without conviction; nor do I remember ever to have fallen into any outward &s;in, but I reflected upon it with guilt and abhorrence; and being deeply affected with the con&s;e|quence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in a future judgment, I was al&s;o often terrified with awful dreams. When on my fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age to Jamaica I was grievou&s;ly exerci&s;ed in my mind, as not one of the mariners had the lea&s;t concern for God, or the &s;alvation of their own &s;ouls; but, on the contrary, appeared to be greedy of eternal death and damnation; and, as St. Paul intimates, "Evil communications corrupt good manners," &s;o this, in proce&s;s of time, though with much fear and trembling, not only cor|rupted my manners, but my morals al&s;o; and, being unacquainted with the devices of the devil, I &s;tole into a rea&s;oning &s;pirit, doubting whether all tho&s;e per&s;ons, who &s;eemed happy in them&s;elves, could be lo&s;t eter|nally or not, although they lived &s;uch horrid lives. The fatal enemy made a fre&s;h attack upon my mind, and forced me &s;till to doubt whether God would &s;uffer any of the human &s;pecies to be puni&s;hed eternally for crimes committed in this their tran&s;itory &s;pan of life,
<PB N="81" REF="84">
although the word of God expre&s;sly declares it &s;hall be &s;o; tho&s;e and &s;imilar temptations got con&s;iderable advantage of me.</P>
<P>When we arrived at Jamaica, the inhabitants, in every particular, corre&s;ponded with tho&s;e rea&s;onings; nor do I remember ever to have met with one man, or woman, who had the fear of God before their eyes in the town of King&s;ton, or Port-Royal, or even the form of godline&s;s among them. They were much addicted to pro|phane cur&s;ing, &s;wearing, whoredom, lying, and Sabbath-breaking, exerci&s;ing the utmo&s;t cruelty on their unhappy negro &s;laves, which never appeared to be a burthen upon their untouched con&s;ciences, and as I have been a &s;pectator to multiplied acts of cruelty, exerci&s;ed by them, upon their poor mi&s;erable black drudges, I &s;hall briefly relate one in&s;tance, which, for its notoriety and unheard of inhumanity, it would be unju&s;t on my part to withhold from the attention of all lovers of clemency and Chri&s;tian di&s;cipline, and from the world in gene|ral. As I went on &s;hore at Ram&s;ay's-Wharf for cer|tain &s;ugars, at the ea&s;t end of King&s;ton, a &s;tout black man, about thirty-&s;ix years of age, was brought down to the crane, at the end of the wharf, by his ma&s;ter, and for the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome almo&s;t namele&s;s error, was delivered up to be puni&s;hed. The mode of exe|cuting this bloody puni&s;hment was as follows: The boat&s;wain tied both wri&s;ts together with a &s;trong cord, then hooked the crane between his wri&s;ts, and hoi&s;ted his body nearly a foot from the floor. The boat&s;wain
<PB N="82" REF="85">
then took a whip, compo&s;ed of cow's-&s;kin, which, when dried hard and twi&s;ted lengthways, forms a kind of cork|&s;crew, the outward edge thereof from end to end being extremely &s;harp. A negro man, in obedience to the boat&s;wain's commands, and at a moment's notice, began the direful action, in pre&s;ence of his vile ma&s;ter, accom|panied by two others of the &s;ame complexion, gazing upon the pitiable object with complai&s;ancy and delight. After the executioner, with his piercing weapon, and with one hundred repeated la&s;hes, had reduced his body from neck to ancles into one flagrant wound; and human nature was no longer able to &s;upport it&s;elf under the remor&s;ele&s;s &s;troke, the poor man hung down his head, and received the remaining cuts like a &s;tock or a &s;tone, repeatedly, though faintly, uttering "Oh! me deady! me deady!" Nor did this move the accur&s;ed fiend (his ma&s;ter) till the poor tortured object appeared in his la&s;t ga&s;ps. He then de&s;ired the boat&s;wain's mate to de&s;i&s;t for a few moments, and approached the almo&s;t expiring &s;lave; where, taking a more particular &s;urvey of his wounds from head to foot, and perceiving two or three inch &s;paces which had not been laid open, he in&s;tantly ran to the boat&s;wain's mate, and compelled him to la&s;h him there al&s;o, and make him all alike. When this was executed he was loo&s;ed, and as he had no &s;trength to &s;tand, &s;o he lay as totally dead, while he was wa&s;hed from head to foot in a tub of &s;alt-beef pickle, placed on the wharf for that purpo&s;e. Here I was greatly a&s;toni&s;hed that the excruciating pains and acute &s;marts, produced by the pickle, did not put a
<PB N="83" REF="86">
&s;peedy end to the remainder of his exi&s;tence. The vile heathen (his ma&s;ter) tarried to behold this operation al&s;o, and afterwards walked off well &s;atisfied. The effect this worked upon my mind (as I ever did, and humbly hope ever &s;hall abhor the ap|pearance of cruelty, more e&s;pecially when I behold &s;uch mercile&s;s acts thereof as I then did) heightened my indignation to &s;uch a degree, that I mu&s;t acknow|ledge, had I been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a knife, &s;word, or any other cutlery in&s;trument, I &s;hould certainly have tran&s;|fixed the body of &s;o infernal a being. This deed was not executed in a corner, or done privily, but upon the open wharf, and in a nominal Chri&s;tian Prote&s;tant country; but if the word "Chri&s;tian" implies (which it unque&s;tionably doth) one who has the mind that was in his heavenly Ma&s;ter, or that pur&s;ues his mo&s;t holy example, then there can be no impropriety, or breach of charity, in pronouncing &s;uch wretches as tho&s;e chil|dren of the devil, rather than the children of God, by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. The Scripture impartially con|demns all &s;uch with this dreadful &s;entence, "Depart, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire," unle&s;s they deeply repent before they are called out of this life. All this gro&s;s ignorance and horrid barbarity over&s;pread the i&s;land of Jamaica in the year 1727, and I am &s;pared to the year 1775; yet there are too many rea&s;ons to believe that the &s;ame, or nearly the &s;ame, &s;pirit of cruelty &s;till predominates over tho&s;e our unfortunate fellow creatures, the greater part of whom are clan|de&s;tinely taken away from their native countries, utterly
<PB N="84" REF="87">
again&s;t the con&s;ent of their parents and them&s;elves, and enforced, by devili&s;h compul&s;ion, into &s;lavery and captivity to the late&s;t moment of their lives, with their children, and childrens children after them, unto many generations, until God undertakes their wretched cau&s;e, and &s;ets them at liberty. Here it may be retorted upon me, "Phy&s;ician, heal thy&s;elf," as I had been in the &s;lave trade for &s;ome years: I confe&s;s and acknow|ledge this charge, but my ca&s;e was different, being at that time an apprentice, and unacquainted with the con&s;equent evils of that horrid trade, I conducted my|&s;elf with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection, according to the be&s;t of my knowledge, in obedience to my ma&s;ter's intere&s;t: But when I arrived at Bo&s;ton, tho&s;e pious and Chri&s;tian people rea&s;oned the matter with me, and, notwith&s;tanding my familiarity with the African trade, and the immediate pro&s;pect of being made a con&s;picuous character in that impious number of Guinea commanders; yet, through the all-wi&s;e Pro|vidence of God, I relinqui&s;hed every point of tempo|ral intere&s;t and advantage; nor had I any the lea&s;t inclinations, or weake&s;t de&s;ires, of re&s;uming them any more: Therefore I am under the highe&s;t obligations to the Almighty for &s;o happy a deliverance from the &s;nare of the devil, &s;eeing that it is one of the mo&s;t ba&s;e practices under the &s;un; but had not the Lord's timely interpo&s;ition manife&s;ted it&s;elf in re&s;cuing me therefrom, I probably might (by promotion to the rank of captain) have proved as eminent a &s;avage as the mo&s;t notorious character among them. Surely
<PB N="85" REF="88">
an immediate cur&s;e from God attends upon this cruel trade, as few voyages are made to tho&s;e parts in which the crews are not thinned by poi&s;on, &s;ui&s;ide, ill u&s;age, and every &s;pecies of de&s;truction; this I have remarked during the &s;lavery under which I laboured when un|happily linked to that trade. And although I was frequently labouring under &s;evere &s;ickne&s;&s;es my&s;elf, yet the merciful hand of God was ever over me, and followed me with daily convictions for &s;ins, yet, having an evil precedent always before me, and the corruptions of my own evil nature ince&s;&s;antly prompting me to &s;in, I &s;ometimes gave way thereto, again&s;t the light of con&s;cience, knowing but very little of the corrupt fountain from whence tho&s;e re&s;i&s;tle&s;s currents of evil perpetually flowed; yet this was always a pain to my mind, and a complete ob&s;tacle again&s;t my having immediate recour&s;e to private devotion. It likewi&s;e proved a barrier again&s;t my &s;olemn deprecations for pardon of my pa&s;t &s;ins, and to guard again&s;t future temptations; but to my greater grief &s;till, I found that, when the bank was broken, the breach was made wider; and being at that time between 17 and 18 years of age, and my carnal pa&s;&s;ions getting the dominion over me, I was oftentimes overcome with &s;wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, drunkenne&s;s and lewdne&s;s, as al&s;o divers other evils; therefore, what with my terrified con|&s;cience, and cro&s;s providences in temporals, my life became completely mi&s;erable; &s;o that for about ten years I continued in that un&s;ettled &s;tate, &s;inning and repenting; nor did the Lord &s;uffer me to pro&s;per,
<PB N="85" REF="89">
either in &s;oul or body; yet I was never without fear of death, hell and judgment: This I con&s;idered a mercy far beyond my de&s;erts.</P>
<P>In the month of July, 1740, Mr. Charles Ca&s;per Greaves, the young bricklayer, already &s;poken of in the foregoing account, was made the in&s;trument of my introduction among the then much de&s;pi&s;ed people, called Methodi&s;ts; a people grievou&s;ly contemned, by rea&s;on of the many evil reports rai&s;ed again&s;t them; one of which was, That the fal&s;e prophets referred to in Scripture were every Sunday, or at other &s;elect opportunities, in the center of their congregations. Another report was, the there were certain &s;ubter|raneous dens and caves, into which the men and women frequently re&s;orted, there to commit all manner of abo|minations. Together with &s;imilar reports; all which I cordially believed, and communicated tho&s;e &s;ictiti|ous relations to my wife, her father and mother, &s;o that we all conceived an utter dete&s;tation to the&s;e Methodi&s;ts: But God's thoughts of them were not as our thoughts, therefore I was, through his Providence, pointed out to be the happy in&s;trument of conver&s;ion both to my own and wife's family, which will more fully appear in the &s;equel hereof. But, previou&s;ly re|turning to young Mr. Greaves, I hope to recount the many intere&s;ting pa&s;&s;ages of our intercour&s;e during his employment in Golden-Lane, by a brewer, to whom I was al&s;o a clerk. I here de&s;cried &s;omething in the countenance and behaviour of this young man,
<PB N="87" REF="90">
very different to that I beheld in others, as well as my&s;elf. However, to my &s;hame be it &s;poken, I treated him with ridicule and contempt, he being a Whitfieldlite, as it was termed; and to the neare&s;t of my remembrance, I &s;ometimes cur&s;ed and &s;wore at him, and told him the whole fraternity of them was a mixture of fal&s;e prophets, hypocrites and ple|beians; all which he bore with a calm magnanimity and unwearied patience; nor did he return me one evil word or look. His countenance appeared full of holy grief, which greatly condemned me, although I concealed it from him; and at twelve o'clock, being dinner time, he a&s;ked me where I dined. I an&s;wered him very roughly, "In the hay-loft." He then &s;aid, "I will go with you;" &s;o we both a&s;cended together, and as &s;oon as we were &s;eated on the tru&s;&s;es of hay, he took a Prayer-Book out of his pocket, and read a few ver&s;es out of the P&s;alms; he then turned round, and a&s;ked me what I thought of tho&s;e words; and as I was fond of the Scriptures, I was the more confounded, well knowing they condemned me more abundantly than before. When he perceived my tongue was &s;ilent, he began rather too ha&s;tily upon me, and a&s;ked me to go with him that evening to hear the Reverend Mr. We&s;ley at the Foundry. I beg'd him, for God's &s;ake, never to a&s;k me a que&s;tion of that kind any more, for I was determined never to go thither, and that if my wife ever came to the knowledge of &s;uch proceedings, &s;he would never forgive me; &s;eeing me &s;o earne&s;t, he con&s;idered it prudent to &s;ay no more; but in that in|&s;tant
<PB N="88" REF="91">
God began to work powerfully upon my &s;oul. Then the eye of my mind &s;aw the Son of God &s;itting on his throne to judge the world, and a calm peace re&s;ted upon me, &s;uch as tongue cannot expre&s;s. This happy change abode with me every moment of that afternoon, and I quickly, though imperceptibly, found my &s;pirit much united to Mr. Greaves, and therefore related my experience to him. I then my|&s;elf propo&s;ed going with him to hear the Reverend Mr. We&s;ley, to which he acceded with great &s;atis|faction, and accordingly we repaired to the Foundry, but were di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>The next morning he took me up to Short's Gar|dens, to hear Mr. We&s;ley; but we were di&s;appointed there likewi&s;e. However, we tarried to hear the &s;er|mon, yet the place was very unplea&s;ant; but the preacher exceedingly more &s;o, who proved to be Mr. Maxfield, a lay-preacher, with a thick-head, of curled hair, re&s;embling a mop, and a clowni&s;h di&s;agreeable voice, &s;tammering out his words, as I ima|gined, without rhyme or rea&s;on. When he had con|cluded I went out in a pet, and a&s;ked Mr. Greaves for what rea&s;ons he brought me there, whether it was to hear a good &s;ermon, or to be di&s;gu&s;ted by the grumbling of a fellow who could not deliver half a dozen words of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>This unkind &s;peech, however, did not appear to affect him the lea&s;t in the world; but, on the contrary,
<PB N="89" REF="92">
excited his compa&s;&s;ion, and increa&s;ed his pity towards me; &s;o that he very mildly enquired of me the place of my re&s;idence, and gave me to under&s;tand, that, without any fear of di&s;appointment, I might depend upon hearing the Reverend Mr. We&s;ley next Sunday morning at five o'clock. I an&s;wered him, more &s;urly than ever I did before, but told him he might call at my apartments if he thought proper, and gave him directions accordingly; and, notwith&s;tanding his place of abode was at Ken&s;ington, and that of mine on Church-Hill, near Black-Friars church, yet he was at my hou&s;e preci&s;ely at four o'clock in the morning. I then went with him to the Foundry, and as we were pa&s;&s;ing through Cheap&s;ide, he commenced a Chri&s;tian conver&s;ation, and a&s;ked me if I ever had an idea of what was become of all tho&s;e who walked that &s;treet four&s;core or an hundred years ago. This prepared my mind for hearing the word, and, as before ob|&s;erved, God had wrought graciou&s;ly upon my &s;oul, &s;o I was the better prepared to receive in&s;tructions. When we entered the Foundry (as I had heard various unaccountable reports both of the place and people) I was much tempted to gaze about me, in order to make a few ob&s;ervations thereon; and finding it a ruinous place, with an old pantile covering, a few rough deal boards put together to con&s;titute a temporary pulpit, and &s;everal other decayed timbers, which compo&s;ed the whole &s;tructure, I began to think it an&s;wered the re|port given of it, as there were many rooms and cor|ners &s;imilar to tho&s;e caverns related to me by my
<PB N="90" REF="93">
former irreligious acquaintances. In one of the&s;e reclu&s;e parts of the Foundry &s;at three or four old wo|men, one of whom appeared in the attitude of an unmoveable &s;tatue, with her apron over her face, nor was &s;he uncovered during the whole time of divine &s;ervice. The enemy of &s;ouls immediately &s;ugge&s;ted that &s;he was an hypocrite. My friend, Mr. Greaves, &s;tood clo&s;e behind me, to prevent my going out, as I had done at Short's-Gardens, to which I was &s;trongly tempted, and had it not been for the multitude of people a&s;&s;embled together, &s;o early in the morning as between four and five o'clock, and the &s;triking con|&s;ideration of &s;uch profound &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, which evidently appeared in the countenance of almo&s;t every per&s;on there, I mu&s;t certainly have given way to the temptation, and thereby have lo&s;t the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing I ever experienced before. I tarried there a full half hour before the &s;ervice began, during which my mind was &s;orely di&s;turbed with many &s;trange notions, as I had been &s;o &s;trongly attached to the church of England. Exactly at five o'clock a general whi&s;per was conveyed through the congregation, and "Here he comes! Here he comes!" was repeated with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure. I was filled with curio&s;ity to &s;ee his per&s;on, which, when I beheld, I much de&s;pi&s;ed. The enemy of &s;ouls, who is never unprepared to hinder the &s;alvation of individuals, &s;ugge&s;ted, that he was &s;ome farmer's &s;on, who, not able to &s;upport him&s;elf, was making a penny in this low and ignoble manner. He pa&s;&s;ed through the con|gregation into the temporary pulpit, and, having his
<PB N="91" REF="94">
robes on, I expected he would have begun with the Church &s;ervice; but, to my a&s;toni&s;hment, the intro|duction to his preaching was the &s;inging an hymn, with which I was almo&s;t enraptured; but his extem|porary prayer was quite unplea&s;ant, as I thought it &s;avoured too much of the Di&s;&s;enters mode of wor&s;hip, which at that time my prejudice could not abide. After which he took his text in the 2d chapter, of the 1&s;t epi&s;tle general of St. John, 12 and 13 ver. "I write unto you, little children, becau&s;e your &s;ins are for|given you, &amp;c." The enemy &s;truck a deadly blow at me, and in that moment &s;ugge&s;ted, that he was a Papi&s;t, as he dwelt &s;o much on forgivene&s;s of &s;ins; and altho' I had read this portion of Scripture many times before, yet I never under&s;tood that we were to know our &s;ins forgiven on earth; &s;uppo&s;ing that it referred only to tho&s;e to whom the apo&s;tle was then writing, e&s;pecially as I had never heard this doctrine preached in the Church. However, my prejudice quickly abated, thro' the excellent wi&s;dom with which Mr. We&s;ley &s;poke: This clearly elucidated the &s;ubject, and proved the point. I then plainly &s;aw I could never be &s;aved without know|ing my &s;ins were forgiven me; and in the mid&s;t of his &s;ermon the Spirit of God &s;ealed the truth of every word upon my heart. At the clo&s;e of the di&s;cour&s;e, however &s;trange it may appear, a &s;mall &s;till voice entered my left ear, with the&s;e words, "This is the truth!" and in&s;tantly I felt it in my heart; and for five and thirty years I have never once doubted of tho&s;e truths and doctrines received among&s;t us, viz. "Of &s;alvation by
<PB N="92" REF="95">
that faith productive of good works." My worthy friend, Mr. Greaves, ob&s;erving my attention to the &s;ermon, a&s;ked me how I liked Mr. We&s;ley. I replied, "As long as I live I will never part from him." Hitherto the Lord hath kept me, and I tru&s;t he ever will. With this fir&s;t &s;ermon my &s;oul was on fire, a&s;&s;ured that it was the truth; &s;o that I was filled with zeal for the righteous cau&s;e, and for &s;ome years I ran, as it were through fire and water, to promote the Redeemer's kingdom, and that not without glorious &s;ucce&s;s. Here I broke off at a &s;troke all my old ac|quaintance in iniquity, who mocked and derided me exceedingly; and one of my mo&s;t intimate acquaint|ances &s;aid to me, "What! Told, are you commenced Whitfieldli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e? As &s;ure as ever you was born, if you follow them, you are damned!" But the heavier my per&s;ecutions were, the more abundantly I rejoiced, and conceived &s;uch love and union to my mini&s;ters and companions in tribulation, that nought but death could make a &s;eparation.</P>
<P>I had now to encounter with my wife and family, with whom for many years I had lived peaceably and in quiet; but they perceiving different marks of an alteration in my mind and behaviour, &s;u&s;pected I had been among the Methodi&s;ts. My wife, though a wor|thy, hone&s;t woman, yet an entire &s;tranger to this new light, happened one day to exclaim very warmly, and &s;aid, "What the devil po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es you? I hope you have not been among the Methodi&s;ts; I'll &s;acrifice
<PB N="93" REF="96">
my &s;oul rather than you &s;hall go among tho&s;e mi&s;|creants;" although I never before this heard an ill expre&s;&s;ion drop from her lips (Oh! how does the car|nal mind rage in the unconverted!) However, I gave her for an&s;wer, "If you are re&s;olved to &s;acrifice your &s;oul, I am re&s;olved, God willing, to join them:" At which &s;he &s;aid no more, nor ever oppo&s;ed my going to the word.</P>
<P>After this happened a very unfortunate circum&s;tance. One evening, as my wife was occa&s;ionally at her ac|cu&s;tomed chandler's &s;hop (which in a circle of years had taken &s;ome hundreds of pounds of my wife's family, between whom and the proprietor, a &s;pirit of unanimi|ty had invariably &s;ub&s;i&s;ted from the origin of their mutual acquaintance) &s;he di&s;covered a leg of pork roa&s;ting by the fire, and, being big with her fourth child, longed to eat of the joint. Mr. C. . . . . was ever free with our family in what my hou&s;e afforded, therefore my wife naturally imagined a &s;imilar degree of freedom on her part would not be con&s;idered as an act of rudene&s;s by Mr. C. . . . .&mdash;At this time, how|ever, he &s;eemed unfamiliar; nor did he invite my wife to partake of his &s;upper, as u&s;uall Mrs. Told, being &s;trictly mode&s;t, went home, and informed her mother of the illiberality of Mr. C. . . . . who went immediately to him, and related to him my wife's condition; upon which he raved, cur&s;ed, &s;wore, and, with the hotte&s;t cen&s;ure, replied, "What! can I not have a joint of meat, but &s;he mu&s;t long for it?"
<PB N="94" REF="97">
throwing out of his mouth, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t &s;arca&s;tic and repeated invectives. Her mother, &s;truck with his behaviour, quickly informed me thereof. I then went to him my&s;elf, and offered him half a gui|nea for a plate-full of the pork, which he &s;harply refu&s;ed. This broke off, for ever afterwards, our acquaintance; but I do not imagine that the di&s;ap|pointment would have effected my wife, had it not been principally owing to the weakne&s;s of her mother, who informed her of the man's cruel behaviour; which had &s;o heavy an effect upon her, that the child became emaciated within her, in&s;omuch that &s;he was never de|livered, but lay eight months under the phy&s;ician's charge, which was attended with a very great expence. At this time my &s;alary was but low, having no more than ten &s;hillings per week: Out of this three-pence was applied to the pay-table every Saturday evening; nine &s;hillings I lodged in the hands of a friend for the &s;up|port of my wife, and the remaining nine-pence was the whole of my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence the following week.</P>
<P>In the year 1744, having been married &s;even years, my wife died, leaving only one child, a girl about two years of age. God now began to ble&s;s me in my temporals, and increa&s;ed my outward circum&s;tances. Soon after my wife'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> death I was recommended to a Mr. Bembow, at New-Crane, Wapping, to &s;erve him as a clerk, where I was greatly re&s;pected, through my diligence in bu&s;ine&s;s, and con&s;tant a&s;&s;iduity when em|ployed in a more infer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or calling. A few months
<PB N="95" REF="98">
of my &s;ervices to Mr. Bembow were &s;carcely expired, before I was vi&s;ited by a Mr. Hogg, one of the Rev. Mr. We&s;ley's &s;tewards, who informed me, that the Rev. Mr. We&s;ley reque&s;ted my undertaking to teach the charity-children at the Foundry-&s;chool; but I being fixed with Mr. Bembow refu&s;ed it. A few days after Mr. Hogg returned, and, together with a repetition of his former me&s;&s;age, he &s;aid that Mr. We&s;ley po&s;itively in&s;i&s;ted upon it, making mention, that my calling thereunto was equally clear and evident with Mr. We&s;ley's calling to the mini&s;try. I then believed it was my duty to comply with his de&s;ires, and therefore informed Mr. Bembow of the intended &s;eparation. Both Mr. Bembow and his wife intreated me to continue my &s;ervices towards them, telling me, at the &s;ame time, that no money &s;hould part us; for that they never had acquired an a&s;&s;i&s;tant who executed their commands with &s;uch attention, and promoted their intere&s;t with &s;uch a&s;&s;iduity and pains, as I con|&s;tantly did; but, as I con&s;idered it the immediate in|terpo&s;ition of God, and dared not, for con&s;cience &s;ake, to reject the undertaking, I then thought proper to continue &s;teadfa&s;tly inexorable to all their intrea|ties, though it was the occa&s;ion of much grief on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The day after our di&s;union I was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Foundry-&s;chool, and, in the &s;pace of a few weeks, collected three&s;core boys and &s;ix girls&punc; but the &s;ociety, though many in number, yet poor withal, could not
<PB N="96" REF="99">
grant me more than ten &s;hillings per week. This, however, was &s;ufficient for me, as they ho&s;pitably boarded and clothed my daughter. Being con&s;cious of my indi&s;pen&s;able duty in this important undertak|ing, and having the children under my care from five in the morning till five in the evening, both winter and &s;ummer, &s;paring no diligence to make them com|plete in the rudiments of their education, I at length, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an u&s;her and four monitors, brought near 40 of them into writing and arithmetic. I continued in the &s;chool &s;even years and three months, and di&s;charged 275 boys, mo&s;t of them to capital trades.</P>
<P>In the year 1744, and as near as I can well remem|ber, in the month of June, I attended the children one morning at the five o'clock preaching; when the Rev. Mr. We&s;ley took his text out of the 25th chapter of St. Matthew, the 41&s;t, 42d, 43d, and 44th ver&s;es, and I having laboured under &s;ore convictions for a con&s;iderable time, was almo&s;t di&s;tracted in my mind, when he read the&s;e words, "I was &s;ick, and in pri&s;on, and ye vi&s;ited me not;" and as I was &s;en&s;ible of my negligence, in never vi&s;iting the pri&s;oners during the cour&s;e of my life, &s;o therefore I was filled with an horror of mind beyond expre&s;&s;ion. I then began to rea&s;on with my&s;elf, that I had obeyed the other in|junctions, but not this one; therefore I could not be &s;aved, as I never had a mere knowledge of either pri|&s;ons or keepers; and to increa&s;e my then prevailing
<PB N="97" REF="100">
wretchedne&s;s, it was &s;ugge&s;ted to me that I &s;hould be eternally mi&s;erable if I did not &s;peedily vi&s;it them. This threw me, well nigh, into a &s;tate of de&s;pondency and hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s, as I was totally unacquainted with the mea&s;ures requi&s;ite to be pur&s;ued for that purpo&s;e. However, the good and gracious God, two or three days after, &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to me in the &s;chool, who informed me of ten malefactors that were under &s;en|tence of death, and would be glad of any of our friends who could make it convenient to go and pray with them. The me&s;&s;enger, who&s;e name was Sarah Peters, gave me to under&s;tand, that they were all much awakened, and that one of them (John Lanca&s;ter) was converted, and full of the love of God. In con|&s;equence of this reviving information, I committed my &s;chool (without an hour's delay) to the &s;uperin|tendency of my tru&s;ty u&s;her, Mr. Marr, and went with Sarah Peters to Newgate, where we had admit|tance into the cell wherein they were confined.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I de&s;ired Lanca&s;ter to call them altogether into his cell, and then began to inquire into the &s;tate of their &s;ouls. I addre&s;&s;ed Mr. Lanca&s;ter fir&s;t, as he appeared to be all alive to God. He told me he had no doubt but that God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, had forgiven him all his &s;ins; and, although (as he ob&s;erved) he was very young, yet he had lived a very wicked life, and acknowledged, that three others, with him&s;elf, were the per&s;ons who robbed the Foundry one morning of all the bra&s;s candle&s;ticks; but he knew
<PB N="98" REF="101">
that &s;hortly he would be with Je&s;us in Paradi&s;e. He added, "This morning, about five o'clock, the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s aro&s;e in my dark cell, and I am now &s;o full of God and heaven, that I am like a barrel of new wine ready to bur&s;t for vent. Oh! for words to expre&s;s what I now feel!" He then dropt on his knees, and earne&s;tly &s;upplicated the Lord Je&s;us to endue the Reverends John and Charles We&s;ley with &s;uch a profu|&s;ion of his ble&s;&s;ed countenance, that when his glorious wi&s;dom calls them hence, they might come to the grave as ripe &s;hocks of corn to the ground, fitted for their ma&s;ter's plea&s;ure. I then &s;poke to the re&s;t, &s;ix of whom &s;eemed clear of their acceptance in the Beloved.</P>
<P>While I was &s;peaking to the&s;e, one Roberts, a car|man, who lived in Whitecro&s;s-Street, entered the cell, looking at me with a &s;ullen &s;hyne&s;s, and, with a countenance &s;peaking the very &s;pirit of the old &s;erpent dwelling in him. This immediately &s;truck me, and I endeavoured to &s;peak to him with all the comfortable words, and u&s;e the mo&s;t pacific exhortati|ons, I was capable of, inviting him to come to the Lord Je&s;us as a poor, helple&s;s, lo&s;t, and undone &s;inner, that Je&s;us was the only &s;inner's Friend; told him, that the King of heaven laid down his life for the chief of &s;inners, and that he certainly died for him: I there|fore quoted (for example) David, Mary Magdalen, Peter, and the thief on the cro&s;s. Now, while I was thus &s;peaking to him, I perceived his countenance to
<PB N="99" REF="102">
change into a plea&s;ing &s;mile, and his uncultivated &s;avage behaviour, happily transformed into a child-like deportment. Now God in&s;tantly made the lyon to lie down with the kid; &s;o the turbulent man became meek, and continued thus till his la&s;t moments.</P>
<P>The report having been made, and the dead-war|rant coming down, eight of the ten were ordered for execution; the other two were re&s;pited: Nor did either of tho&s;e two appear to have any the lea&s;t regard or concern for their deathle&s;s &s;ouls; therefore, I tru&s;t, they were &s;pared for a good purpo&s;e, that they might have time for repentance and amendment of life.</P>
<P>The day arrived, whereon the other eight malefactors were to die. Sarah Peters and my&s;elf were early at the cell, in order to render them all the &s;piritual &s;ervice that was within our power. The keeper having re|ceived directions on the over-night to lock them all up in one cell, that they might pour out their &s;ouls together in fervent &s;olemn prayer to Almighty God, they paid very circum&s;pect attention thereto, and a happy night it proved to each of them; &s;o that when they were led down from their cell, they appeared like giants refre&s;hed with wine; nor was the fear of death apparent in any of their countenances. We then went up to the chapel, when my companion and my&s;elf conver&s;ed with them in the pre&s;s-yard room. Upon being called out to have their irons taken off, Lan|ca&s;ter
<PB N="100" REF="103">
was the fir&s;t: While they were di&s;burthening his legs thereof, the &s;heriff being pre&s;ent, Lanca&s;ter looked up to heaven with a plea&s;ant &s;mile, and &s;aid, "Glory be to God for the fir&s;t moment of my entrance into this place; for before I came hither my heart was as hard as my cell wall, and my &s;oul was as black as hell; but, Oh! I am now wa&s;hed, clearly wa&s;hed, from all my &s;ins, and by one o'clock &s;hall be with Je&s;us in Paradi&s;e;" and, with many &s;trong and forci|ble expre&s;&s;ions, he exhorted the innumerable &s;pectators to flee from the wrath to come. This cau&s;ed the &s;heriff to &s;hed tears, and a&s;k Mr. Lanca&s;ter if he was really in earne&s;t, being &s;o greatly affected with his lively and animated &s;pirit. As their irons were taken off, they were remanded back to the pre&s;s-yard room; but by &s;ome accident they were a long time getting off the la&s;t man's fetters. When they were gotten off, Lanca&s;ter, beholding him at a &s;hort di&s;tance, clap|ped his hands together, and joyfully proclaimed, "Here comes another of our little flock." A gen|tleman pre&s;ent &s;aid (with an apparent &s;ympathizing &s;pirit) "I think it is too great a flock upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion!" Lanca&s;ter, with the greate&s;t fluency of &s;peech, and with an a&s;piring voice, &s;aid, "Oh! no, it is not too great a flock for the Shepherd Je&s;us; there is room enough in heaven for us all." When he exhorted the populace to for&s;ake their &s;ins, he particularly en|deavoured to pre&s;s on them to come to the Throne of Grace immediately, and without fear, a&s;&s;uring them,
<PB N="101" REF="104">
that they would find him a gracious and merciful God, to forgive them as he had forgiven him. At length they were ordered into the cart, and I was prevailed upon to go with them. When we were in the cart, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to each of the&s;e &s;eparately. The fir&s;t per&s;on was Mr. Atkins, the &s;on of a glazier, in the city, a youth of 19 years of age. I &s;aid to him, "My dear, are you afraid to die?" He replied, "No, Sir, really, I am not." I then a&s;ked him, "Wherefore he was not afraid to die?" He again an&s;wered me, "Becau&s;e I have laid my &s;oul at the feet of Je&s;us, therefore I am not afraid to die." I then &s;poke to Mr. Gardner, a journeyman carpenter, about the age of 50, who made a very comfortable report of what the Lord had done for his &s;oul, through the free remi&s;&s;ion of all his pa&s;t &s;ins, and that he found the true peace of God reigning in his heart. The la&s;t per&s;on to whom I &s;poke was one Thomp&s;on, a very illiterate young man; but he, agreeable to the others, entertained no fear of  death; a&s;&s;uring me al&s;o, that he was perfectly happy in his Saviour, and continued &s;o till his la&s;t moments. This was the fir&s;t time of my vi&s;iting the malefactors at Newgate, and of my attendance upon them to the place of execution; and then it was not without much &s;hame and fear, becau&s;e I clearly perceived the greater part of the populace con&s;idered me as one of the &s;uf|ferers. When we came to the fatal tree, Lanca&s;ter lifted up his eyes thereto, and &s;aid, "Ble&s;&s;ed be God," then prayed extemporary in a very excellent manner, and the others behaved with great di&s;cretion.
<PB N="102" REF="105">
John Lanca&s;ter had no friend who could procure for his body a proper interment; &s;o that, when they had hung the u&s;ual &s;pace of time, and were cut down, the &s;urgeon's mob &s;ecured the body of Lanca&s;ter, and carried it over to Paddington. There was a very crouded concour&s;e, among whom were numberle&s;s gin and gingerbread vendors, accompanied by pick-pockets and whores, of almo&s;t every denomination in London; in &s;hort, the whole &s;cene re&s;embled a principal fair, rather than an awful execution. Now when the mob was nearly di&s;per&s;ed, and there remained only a few by&s;tanders, with an old woman who &s;old gin, a remarkable occurrence took place, and operated to the following effect:</P>
<P>A company of eight &s;ailors, with truncheons in their hands, having come to &s;ee the execution, looked up to the gallows with an angry countenance, the bodies having been cut down &s;ome minutes previous to their arrival. The old woman, before named, who &s;old gin, ob&s;erving the&s;e tars to grow violent, by rea&s;on of their di&s;appointment, mildly acco&s;ted them, and &s;aid, "Gentlemen, I &s;uppo&s;e you want the man that the &s;urgeons have got." "Ay," replied the &s;ailors, "where is he?" The poor affrighted woman gave them to under&s;tand, that the &s;urgeons crew had carried him over to Paddington, and &s;he pointed out to them the direct road thereto. They ha&s;tened away, and as they entered the town, enquiry was made by them where the &s;urgeons mob was to be di&s;covered; and
<PB N="103" REF="106">
receiving the information they wanted, they went and demanded the body of John Lanca&s;ter. When the &s;ailors had obtained the body, two of them ca&s;t it on their &s;houlders, and carried him round by I&s;lington; they being tired out with its pre&s;&s;ure, two others laid them&s;elves under the weight of the body, and carried it from thence to Shoreditch; then two more carried it from Shoreditch to Coverley's-fields; at length, after they were all rendered completely weary, and unable to carry it any farther, the &s;equel of their project, and their ultimate contrivance to rid them&s;elves of the body was, an unanimous con&s;ent to lay it on the &s;tep of the fir&s;t door they came to. They did &s;o, and then went their way. This gave birth to a great riot in the neighbourhood, which brought an old wo|man, who lived in the hou&s;e, down &s;tairs. When &s;he &s;aw the corp&s;e lay at the &s;tep of the door, &s;he proclaim|ed, with an agitated &s;pirit, "Lord, here is my &s;on, John Lanca&s;ter!" This being &s;pread abroad, came to the knowledge of the Methodi&s;ts, who made a col|lection, and got him a &s;hroud and a good &s;trong coffin. I was &s;oon informed of this event, which was peculiarly &s;ingular, as the &s;eamen had no knowledge of the body, nor to whom he belonged when living. My &s;econd wife went with me to &s;ee him, previous to the burial; but neither of us could perceive the lea&s;t alteration in his vi&s;age, or features, or any appearance of violence on any part of his body. A plea&s;ant &s;mile appeared in his countenance, and he lay as in a &s;weet &s;leep.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="107">From the time of this introduction among the pri&s;o|ners, I preached frequently to the &s;elons and debtors in Newgate. Of the latter I joined about 36 in a regular &s;ociety; nor would they &s;uffer any individual to live in any outward &s;in, as they never neglected to inform me of every &s;uch in&s;tance on my following vi&s;itation. At that time I had &s;o lively a zeal for the cau&s;e of re|ligion, from my fir&s;t hearing the Go&s;pel, that I &s;pared no pains or labour to do all the good that was then in my power, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, both to the bodies and &s;ouls of &s;inners, embracing every oppor|tunity, both in re&s;pect to hearing and &s;peaking; &s;o that in proce&s;s of time I preached in every pri&s;on, as well as many workhou&s;es in and about London; and frequently travelled to almo&s;t every town within 12 miles around this metropolis; nor did I ever doubt, but that God as &s;urely called me to that office of ad|mini&s;tering his Holy Word to the unhappy malefactors, as St. Paul was called to the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>I &s;till continued in the Foundry-&s;chool, and by my &s;econd marriage to the widow of captain Robert Grif|fith, who had five children living, my family was much increa&s;ed in temporal circum&s;tances for the &s;pace of a few years, and my &s;oul was exceedingly delighted; but when I began to confine my&s;elf to certain regula|tions, &s;uch as ri&s;ing at four o'clock every morning, going to the five o'clock preaching, diligently attend|ing the church-&s;ervice, and &s;trictly ob&s;erving all the other ordinances of God, I was then clearly convinced
<PB N="105" REF="108">
of my unbelief, of my lo&s;t e&s;tate, and of the carnal mind, which is at enmity with God. No tongue can expre&s;s the bitterne&s;s of &s;oul I then laboured under, both day and night, and that for a long time having "no re&s;t in my fle&s;h by rea&s;on of my &s;in;" and although my place of abode joined the Foundry, yet, when I have left the &s;chool, to go either to breakfa&s;t or dinner, my agony of mind has been &s;o dreadfully heavy, that I have even forgot to eat my bread, and have oftentimes wandered into Hoxton-Fields, there to pour out my mi&s;ery before God. Frequently after I had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my &s;cholars in the evening, I have, rather than go to my own apartments, taken a &s;olitary walk into the fields till nine, ten and eleven o'clock, roaring for the very di&s;quietude of my &s;oul; and notwith&s;tanding I never could accu&s;e my&s;elf of inattention to any ordi|nance, fa&s;ting and praying, and fitting up both early and late, yet my unbelief prevailed, till I became completely mi&s;erable. In this &s;ituation I continued about three years, &s;o that I "cho&s;e &s;trangling rather than life;" nor could I, with all my hearing and &s;elf-denial, overcome this damning &s;in of unbelief. Never was I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o irritable a di&s;po&s;ition, and at the time when people told me I could believe if I would, gladly would I have given worlds to believe, were they in my power; but "&s;uch power belongeth to God alone," and glory be to him, he di&s;played that power in my deliverance. The manner of my re&s;cue, as it appeared to me, in a manife&s;t reality, I &s;hall &s;imply and &s;in|cerely relate. Taking one morning my melancholy
<PB N="106" REF="109">
walk, after five o'clock preaching, in the deepe&s;t di|&s;tre&s;s of mind, and as I was pa&s;&s;ing Ratcliff-Row, leading to the Shepherd and Shepherde&s;s (a walk I had taken before times out of number) I perceived a cow coming towards me. I really wi&s;hed in my heart I was that bea&s;t, as I con&s;idered it ten thou&s;and times happier than my&s;elf. The next thing that pa&s;&s;ed me was a dog; I heartily wi&s;hed I could metamorpho&s;e my body and mind into that of the dog's. Afterwards I ob&s;erved a man taking his cour&s;e a few yards off; I then thought that man would afford me the greate&s;t happine&s;s I ever before experienced, if he would put an end to &s;o wretched a life. In the&s;e mi&s;erable and di&s;tracted moments I had no conception of a delive|rance &s;o very near, e&s;pecially as the enemy of my &s;oul had ju&s;t previou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ted to me, that if I lived 500 years longer in the world I &s;hould never receive a transformation of &s;pirit by the grace of God; all which I believed. However, I continued walking, by a &s;low gradation, till I came to a lone&s;ome part of a field, by the Shepherd and Shepherde&s;s, which I ima|gined was better calculated for retirement than any other &s;pot thereabouts. When I had &s;ecluded my&s;elf therein, being alone, on a &s;udden, in the twinkling of an eye, "a hand &s;truck me a weighty blow on the top of my head," which in &s;ome mea&s;ure affected my &s;en&s;es; but I in&s;tantly found my&s;elf crying with a loud voice, "Prai&s;e God, prai&s;e God," and, looking up, I beheld the ethereal univer&s;e, replete with the glory of God; and that glory of &s;uch &s;ub&s;tance and palpa|bility,
<PB N="107" REF="110">
I thought I could have laid hold of it with my hand. This attended me for the &s;pace of a minute; but was &s;ucceeded by an uncommon thick darkne&s;s, through which a black dart, as if it was &s;hot from the hill near I&s;lington, pierced its way, and, with wonderful &s;wiftne&s;s, entered my heart. I did not feel any pain thereby; but it was followed with the&s;e words, "This is one of your old delu&s;ions." Although I was &s;tag|gered at this for a few moments, yet I was quickly enabled to look up to heaven, and to be&s;eech God in fervent prayer, that I might more fully know whether this was the remi&s;&s;ion of my &s;ins, or not, as at the fir&s;t I felt un&s;peakable peace, which far outweighed all my former mi&s;ery; and as I looked up, the heavens were unclo&s;ed about a mile in length, as it appeared to my mortal eyes, and tapered away to a point at each end. The center of this awful and &s;acred avenue was about twelve feet wide, wherein I &s;aw the Lord Je&s;us &s;tand|ing in the form of a man, holding both his ine&s;timably precious hands upright, and from the palms thereof the blood &s;treaming down; floods of tears gu&s;hed from my eyes, and trickled down my cheeks. I &s;aid, "Lord, it is enough!" nor have I once doubted &s;ince, but that I was freely ju&s;tified at that time.</P>
<P>Now, as I had been greatly harra&s;&s;ed when in my wretched &s;tate with the doctrine of election, I prayed the Lord to explain to me, whether the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t was &s;ufficient to &s;ave all the world, or not, and immediately &s;ome articulate voice a&s;ked me the fol|lowing
<PB N="108" REF="111">
que&s;tion: "How did you find your&s;elf an hour ago?" I then recollected that I was in a wretched and lo&s;t &s;tate. The voice again &s;ugge&s;ted, "All the world is but as one man, and one man as all the world." The meaning of the&s;e words were as clear to my intellectual &s;en&s;ations, as the &s;un performing its diurnal cour&s;e; therefore one drop of the blood of Chri&s;t was not only &s;ufficient to &s;ave the whole world, but ten thou&s;and worlds of &s;inners, if there were &s;o many. This I believed as an unque&s;tionable a&s;&s;ertion of verity; nor, &s;ince this, do I ever remember to have experienced the &s;lighte&s;t temptation to the doctrine of prede&s;tination, whereof I cannot, by any means, con|&s;ider my&s;elf a defender.</P>
<P>Seeing that nothing remarkable has occurred in my &s;piritual or temporal affairs, from the year 1745 to 1775, I &s;hall now confine my&s;elf to give a farther ac|count of my elaborate re&s;earches into the &s;ituation of the pri&s;oners at Newgate, and into the &s;tate of their &s;ouls; but I purpo&s;e not to enter into a minute hi&s;tory of each, but of &s;uch only as were the mo&s;t remarkable characters among them, in the cour&s;e of my &s;everal vi&s;itations.</P>
<P>I believe it may be upwards of twenty-one years &s;ince I fir&s;t attended the pri&s;oners in Newgate, and there chiefly on the debtors &s;ide; though &s;ometimes I conver&s;ed in public among the felons, and the Lord is
<PB N="109" REF="112">
witne&s;s to the horrible &s;cene, and the dreadful emblem of the infernal pit, which was therein pourtrayed, con|&s;i&s;ting of &s;wearing, cur&s;ing, &s;peaking bla&s;phemies, and foul conver&s;ation, and that continually. The un|fortunate per&s;ons confined in that pri&s;on found it the neare&s;t re&s;emblance to the picture of hell of any under the canopy of heaven. However, having a con&s;tant pre&s;&s;ure upon my mind to &s;tand up for God in the mid&s;t of them, and to defend his cau&s;e again&s;t tho&s;e mighty &s;inners, while heedle&s;sly proceeding in this de&s;tructive path, I therefore prayed to God for wi&s;dom and forti|tude in the attempt of that di&s;agreeable ta&s;k to fle&s;h and blood. I confe&s;s I did &s;o many times with fear and trembling, yet I can con&s;cientiou&s;ly announce to the world, I ever found the Lord overcoming all my apprehen&s;ive dreads, and confounding the adver&s;ary. Indeed, for a few years, I could not fully perceive my call to attend the malefactors, meeting with &s;o many and various repul&s;es from the keepers and ordinary, as al&s;o from the pri&s;oners them&s;elves; but notwith&s;tand|ing this oppo&s;ition, I was the more vehemently pre&s;&s;ed on in &s;pirit to bur&s;t through all; &s;o that, by the aid of him who has all power in heaven and earth, I be|came (in the name of God) daringly re&s;olute in that point, and would conform my&s;elf to no denial. The ordinary (Mr. Taylor) con&s;tantly on Sunday mornings &s;tationed him&s;elf a few doors from Newgate, for the &s;pace of two hours or more, to ob&s;truct my entrance, in forbidding all the turnkeys re&s;pectively to give me admittance; yet the God of all compa&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e
<PB N="110" REF="113">
&s;ouls for whom Chri&s;t died, frequently made an en|trance for me, &s;o that I had an opportunity of preach|ing every Sunday morning on the debtors-&s;ide, to the number of 40 pri&s;oners, who behaved with much &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and attention; after which I propo&s;ed to them the uniting them&s;elves together in the nature of a &s;ociety, and acquainted them al&s;o with the manner and re&s;trictive proceedings of Mr. We&s;ley throughout his &s;everal congregations. I read and left with them the rules of our &s;ociety, particularly de&s;iring them to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly whether they deemed it proper to confine them&s;elves to &s;uch regulations or not. Upon my &s;ucceeding vi&s;it I under&s;tood, that, through the circum&s;pection of two or three pri&s;oners, who were men of good under&s;tanding, and of a liberal educa|tion, that had highly approved of my propo&s;als, an unity had taken place among 30 or more. For a con&s;iderable time afterwards they payed regular atten|tion to preaching, and to the meeting of the young &s;ociety, behaving them&s;elves &s;uitable to what might be rea&s;onably expected from per&s;ons in a &s;ituation like theirs. If any offence was given to the &s;ociety in my ab&s;ence, a report of the per&s;on or per&s;ons, by whom &s;uch offence had been occa&s;ioned, was never withheld from my notice. This de&s;irable oeconomy continued for a con&s;iderable time, when a great tumult was made by the ordinary, who ever afterwards &s;hut me out from tho&s;e parts of the pri&s;on: It may here be ob|&s;erved, there were many intermediate workings of
<PB N="111" REF="114">
God's ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit among the felons; but more emi|nently among the condemned malefactors.</P>
<P>I hope now to give a &s;hort account of God's re|markable working upon the &s;ouls of Mr. Holmes and five others, four of whom were mo&s;t rancorous and un|forgiving Roman Catholicks. The ca&s;e of Mr. Holmes nearly corre&s;ponded with that of John Lanca&s;ter, already treated of in the foregoing relations. This man was excellently u&s;eful to the others of his fellow &s;ufferers; and likewi&s;e greatly &s;o to the &s;pectators. Having no oppo&s;ition, I joyfully embraced the opportunity of vi&s;iting the&s;e &s;ix malefactors, and &s;oon gained my point over the two Prote&s;tants and three of the Papi&s;ts, who, by force of my arguments, rejected further ad|vice from the prie&s;t, and clo&s;ed in with &s;alvation by faith alone.</P>
<P>Here I endeavoured to take &s;uch methods of con|ducting my&s;elf towards the&s;e men, as I had u&s;ually done with the former happy departed &s;ouls; and as I had an open door into the cells, which ever proved the mo&s;t beneficial to the then confined pri&s;oners, I went from cell to cell, being locked in with every individual for a longer or &s;horter time, according to the &s;ituation and &s;tate of mind of each pri&s;oner, and was permitted by the turnkey to retire without any emolument whatever: Herein the hand of the Almighty was quite evident. Finding Mr. Holmes more lively
<PB N="112" REF="115">
and active than any of the re&s;t, he an&s;wered a very u&s;eful purpo&s;e; having a clear &s;en&s;e of forgivene&s;s him&s;elf, he zealou&s;ly exerted him&s;elf in the means of bringing the re&s;t of his fellow-&s;ufferers to a true &s;en&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ity of being born again; and truly the Lord pro&s;pered his endeavours, &s;o that at every re|peated vi&s;it, I made to them (which was very frequent) I found the re&s;t of the malefactors either under &s;tronger convictions, or ju&s;t ready to &s;tep into the pool. For my own part, the advice I gave them was principally to make them the more deeply &s;en&s;ible of their lo&s;t e&s;tate, while I was very cautious of daubing them with untempered morter; and hence I always per|ceived their conver&s;ions were more &s;olid, real, and permanent; &s;o that what they had received was truly &s;hewn in their conduct. A few days before their death, I came more particularly home to the point, and ex|hibited to both Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts how ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible it was for happine&s;s to be obtained, either in time or eternity, without the clear knowledge of God being reconciled to them through the death and pa&s;&s;ion of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, together with a &s;en&s;e of their redemption through his blood, the forgivene&s;s of their &s;ins. None of them appeared to be clear in this point, except Holmes; all the re&s;t &s;till lay at the pool-&s;ide.</P>
<P>Here I was &s;truck with the conduct of one of the young Roman Catholicks, who, notwith&s;tanding all that I could
<PB N="113" REF="116">
force into his mind, would not be reconciled to his pro&s;ecutor, declaring that he would maintain that ob|&s;tinate re&s;olution to his la&s;t moments! I told him, if he retained and cheri&s;hed that dangerous re&s;olution, the Word of God lay flat again&s;t him, quoting this pa&s;&s;age of Scripture, "If ye from your heart forgive not every one his brother's tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es." This greatly alarmed his mind, &s;o that he became more teachable. The night before their execution, I de&s;ired the inner keeper, or turnkey, of their re&s;pective cells, to give them the opportunity of a&s;&s;embling together in one cell, to the end they might all pa&s;s their la&s;t hours in unitedly pouring out their &s;ouls in &s;ervent and mighty prayer before God: This was granted agree|able to my de&s;ires. I al&s;o reque&s;ted one of the pri&s;o|ners, who had been confined for &s;ome years, to attend them diligently, and read to them. He did &s;o, and they accordingly began their exerci&s;e from out of the Prayer Book; but, after &s;pending two hours in that lifele&s;s frame, and finding their &s;pirits to be in no wi&s;e animated thereby, one of the malefactors was moved, and &s;aid, "Come, let us pray extempore, and who knows but God will open our mouths." They all gladly con&s;ented thereto, and the Lord in his mercy did (in compa&s;&s;ion to their infirmities) not only open their mouths, but their hearts too, and that in an unu&s;ual manner, manife&s;ting him&s;elf unto them, as he does not unto the world; &s;o that they wre&s;tled with
<PB N="114" REF="117">
God in &s;uch great fervor of &s;pirit, from nine till twelve o'clock, that each of them was in a profu&s;e bath of &s;weat. Then they laid them&s;elves down to re&s;t from twelve till two, when every one of them again joined them&s;elves in eager prayer; nor did they de&s;i&s;t from their happy exerci&s;e till the time arrived, when they were &s;ummoned to chapel I went that morning before day-light, and availed my&s;elf of the joyful opportunity of getting admittance ju&s;t before they were let down. As they entered the pre&s;s-yard, I &s;aw the happy con|&s;equence of their la&s;t acts of devotion and &s;olemnity. No tongue or pen is able faintly to repre&s;ent the &s;olemn joy and peace which appeared in each coun|tenance; but particularly in the young Roman Catho|licks, whom I could not prevail upon to forgive his pro&s;ecutor: To him I chiefly addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, &s;aying, "My dear man, how do you find your&s;elf?" He re|plied, with a plea&s;ant voice, and a heavenly counte|nance, "Find my&s;elf! why, truly Sir, my &s;oul is &s;o filled with light, love and peace, that I am the &s;ame as if I had nothing be&s;ide within me!" In this rap|turous &s;pirit he continued to his latter moments. After chapel, Holmes, with the others, came down, and had their irons &s;truck off. He &s;poke to all about him of the un&s;peakable love of God to him; and a&s;&s;ured them that he knew God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, had forgiven him all his &s;ins: His words were &s;o very powerful, that he drew abun|dance of tears from the &s;pectators. After they were haltered, they were put into three carts, and &s;ent for execution. I went with Holmes in the fir&s;t, &s;pending
<PB N="115" REF="118">
our way to the mo&s;t advantage. Upon our arrival at the tree, Holmes fir&s;t &s;tood up, and, lifting his eyes to heaven, &s;aid, "Lord, did&s;t not thou die for &s;inners? thou did&s;t die for me!" Then turning round to the multitude, he prayed extempore &s;o very excellently, that it cau&s;ed hundreds to be in tears round the gal|lows. When prayers were fini&s;hed by the ordinary, all of them, agreeable to my reque&s;t, went off the &s;tage of mortality, fir&s;t turning round, and putting their faces to each other, their hands being tied, crying out, as in the voice of one man, "Lord Je&s;us receive our &s;pirits."</P>
<P>During the &s;paces of time which intervened between the &s;everal executions, I frequently preached and ex|horted among the felons and debtors in Newgate, and con&s;tantly vi&s;ited the &s;ick in all parts of the pri&s;on, which I have &s;ufficient rea&s;on to believe was ble&s;&s;ed, in a great mea&s;ure, to many of their &s;ouls; as, in con&s;e|quence of tho&s;e means, numbers were prepared to receive the glad tidings of &s;alvation when under &s;en|tence of death.</P>
<P>Some years ago, Me&s;&s;rs. Morgan, Whalley, Brett, and Dupree, with two more, being then under &s;entence of death, were ordered for execution, in the late king's reign; and notwith&s;tanding they were all con|&s;picuous characters in life, yet the highe&s;t intere&s;t the nation could afford was ineffectual to obtain an ex|emption
<PB N="116" REF="119">
from ju&s;tice, e&s;pecially as their fatal delin|quency was the fruit of an intoxicated project.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance was thus: They all conjunctly agreed upon a party of plea&s;ure, at the election of a certain member for Chelmsford, E&s;&s;ex; but after they had glutted them&s;elves with an immoderate regale|ment, they u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">animou&s;ly con&s;ented to divert them|&s;elves by going out upon the roads, and there en|deavour to effect a robbery on the fir&s;t individual that might pre&s;ent him&s;elf in their way. In the cour&s;e of the&s;e their unre&s;trained proceedings, a certain farmer chanced to pa&s;s them, who was attacked by the&s;e un|happy men, and robbed of all his money. After this the farmer, having met with a&s;&s;i&s;tance, pur&s;ued them all into Chelmsford, where they were every one &s;e|cured, and were removed by a habeas the next day to London; they took their trials, were ca&s;t, received &s;entence of death, and ordered, as before mentioned, for execution. Mr. Brett was the &s;on of an eminent divine in Dublin! Mr. Whalley a gentleman of a con|&s;iderable fortune, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of three country &s;eats of his own! Mr. Dapree was al&s;o the complete gentleman! and Mr. Morgan an officer on board one of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war! The la&s;t of the&s;e was frequently vi&s;ited by lady Elizabeth Hamilton (the duke of Hamilton's daughter) both before and after &s;entence. I have &s;eldom failed to be pre&s;ent with them at their &s;everal interviews in Newgate, and thereby
<PB N="117" REF="120">
under&s;tood, that if this lamentable affair had not taken place, the connubials of Mr. Morgan and lady Betty were to have been &s;olemnized in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>This lady, like the importunate widow &s;et forth in the Go&s;pel, went daily to his Maje&s;ty, as did al&s;o others who had great influence, at her reque&s;t, and pleaded with his Maje&s;ty for the life of Mr. Morgan; but, at the fir&s;t, his Maje&s;ty con&s;idering it a point of inju&s;tice, as well as partiality, would by no means at|tend to her plaintive petitions. Another con&s;ideration was, that they were all per&s;ons of dignity and fortune, and could not plead nece&s;&s;ity to palliate the enormity of tho&s;e robberies, as many unhappy &s;ufferers could, therefore his Maje&s;ty &s;aid, his &s;ubjects were not to be put in bodily fear, and &s;uffer the lo&s;s of their property, merely through a capricious, wanton whim: However, the morning prior to the execution lady Betty Hamilton appeared before his Maje&s;ty, and fell upon her knees, (I &s;uppo&s;e in tears too.) "My lady," &s;aid his Maje&s;ty, "there is no end to your importunity; I will &s;pare his life, upon condition that he be not acquainted therewith till he arrives at the place of execution." The&s;e documents were with the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion attend|ed to; and accordingly Mr. Brett, Mr. Whalley, and Mr. Dupree, were tied up to the gallows; the other cart with Mr. Morgan, and two other gentlemen, fol|lowed; but the &s;heriff, upon ordering the coach to
<PB N="118" REF="121">
&s;top, produced the re&s;pite &s;ent to Mr. Morgan from his Maje&s;ty. 'Tis hard to expre&s;s the &s;udden alarm this made among the numerous multitude; and when I turned round and &s;aw one of the pri&s;oners out of the cart, with his halter loo&s;e, falling to the ground, he having fainted away at the &s;udden news, I was in|&s;tantly &s;eized with a great terror, as I thought it was a re&s;cue rather than a reprieve; but when I beheld Mr. Morgan put into a coach, and perceiving that lady Betty Hamilton was &s;eated therein, in order to receive him, my fear was at an end, and truly I was very well plea&s;ed on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the coach, with Mr. Morgan and the lady, had drove off for Newgate, a venerable gentle|man, who carried the appearance of a courtier, walked up to the fir&s;t cart, and, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mr. Dupree in a very Chri&s;tian manner, begged him to look &s;tedfa&s;tly to God, in who&s;e pre&s;ence he would &s;hortly appear, and hoped, the mercy his companion received would have no bad effect upon him. Mr. Dupree, with the mo&s;t unimaginable calmne&s;s and compo&s;ure of mind, &s;aid, "Sir, I thank God that he is thus reprieved; it does not by any means affect me:" This gave the gentleman much &s;atisfaction. Now when prayers were ended, I addre&s;&s;ed each of them in the mo&s;t awful and &s;triking words I was capable of, and which, I have great rea&s;on to believe, were not to little purpo&s;e, as they all appeared intirely
<PB N="119" REF="122">
re&s;igned to their fate. Mr. Brett, the clergyman's &s;on, di&s;played the conduct of a gentleman and &s;cholar: In a mild &s;pirit, he earne&s;tly craved the &s;incere prayers of the multitude; and likewi&s;e, in his la&s;t piece of exhortation, he conjured them all to take warning by the untimely end of the three objects of their pre&s;ent attention. When they were turned off, and the mob nearly di&s;per&s;ed, I ha&s;tened back to Newgate, and there &s;eriou&s;ly conver&s;ed with Mr. Morgan, who, in con&s;equence of the unexpected change, was &s;carcely recovered.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of our reciprocal conver&s;ation he told me his mind, a few minutes previous to and at the arrival of his reprieve, was in &s;o happy a &s;tate, that he could not immediately tell whether life or death was be&s;t; yet, when about &s;ix weeks were elap&s;ed, it evidently appeared, by Mr. Morgan's tran&s;actions, that his Maje&s;ty's gracious act of lenity was clearly worn off his remembrance; for one day, as I chanced to pay him a vi&s;it (whereof he was not previou&s;ly ap|pri&s;ed) I detected him in playing at cards with and again&s;t a Mr. Barrett, who was confined upon the &s;up|po&s;ition of defrauding his creditors. This man was apparently totally de&s;titute of the fear or knowledge of God, and was al&s;o very prejudicial in his behaviour to the &s;ouls of poor condemned pri&s;oners, ever at|tempting to divert their minds from their attention to that which was truly good; likewi&s;e &s;etting at nought,
<PB N="120" REF="123">
and expo&s;ing to cen&s;ure and ridicule, tho&s;e who ince&s;|&s;antly laboured for their eternal benefit; but the Lord over-ruled him. I then laid before Mr. Morgan the dangerous folly of &s;uch proceedings, and added, "if &s;uch conduct as that (viz. playing at cards) is of|tentimes, through point of con&s;cience, aboli&s;hed by men of common &s;en&s;e, how much more then ought &s;uch empty and &s;oul-de&s;troying amu&s;ement to be de&s;pi&s;ed by one who had &s;o recently been re&s;cued from death by his Maje&s;ty's great clemency in &s;o con&s;picuous a man|ner as he him&s;elf had! I therefore intreated him to lay the cards a&s;ide, and never attempt to re&s;ume &s;uch folly any more. By virtue of this remon&s;trance he became very complai&s;ant, and, as an ob&s;equious child, conforms his behaviour to the wi&s;hes of his parents, ju&s;t &s;o Mr. Morgan renounced the diver&s;ion to which his mind was &s;o &s;trongly inured; and, in a moment's time, he marked the line of his conduct with an hum|ble attention to all my &s;ympathi&s;ing reproofs.</P>
<P>The before-mentioned Mr. Barrett, finding I had taken the attention of Mr. Morgan from off his evil allure|ments, began to abu&s;e me very much, and al&s;o boa&s;ted that it was not in the power of all the world to hurt him; that he defied all the judges to bring him in as a culprit upon trial; but, however, &s;hortly after, his creditors, having a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion that he had &s;ome effects concealed in a che&s;t, wherewith he was furni&s;h|ed in Newgate, obtained a judicial order to &s;earch it,
<PB N="121" REF="124">
and found (as they had been informed) to the amount of &pound;5000 in bank notes, cut in halves. Soon after this his trial came on, and he was deemed guilty by the judges. He was condemned with Mr. Samuel Lee, a fine young gentleman, for forgery, and they were both accordingly ordered for execution; Mr. Barrett, on the Tue&s;day, in Smithfield; Mr. Lee, on the Wedne&s;|day, at Tyburn. Mr. Barrett refu&s;ed my company, and the &s;ervice I might have been to him; therefore I cannot give my readers any account of him, as touch|ing his behaviour during his latter moments; yet Mr. Lee, the morning before his execution, was very attentive to in&s;truction, and ju&s;t before he was turned off the &s;tage of life, put a letter into my hand, which I opened, and was deeply affected with the contents thereof: It began thus, "Oh, eternity! eternity! eternity! who can fathom the depths of eternity?" The whole body of the letter expre&s;&s;ed the devoute&s;t &s;entiments of his inmo&s;t &s;oul. His behaviour on the pa&s;&s;age <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o and at the place of execution was altogether &s;erious; nor did he leave room to doubt of his eternal &s;alvation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next &s;peak of what I heard and knew of Mary Edmon&s;on, who was executed on Kennington-Common, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of murdering her aunt at Rotherhithe. This unfortunate young woman was under clo&s;e con&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ement a great length of time. The day of her removal arrived; &s;he was then conveyed
<PB N="122" REF="125">
to King&s;ton, there to &s;tand trial before judge Denni|&s;on, who &s;ome time before tried a Mr. Coleman, a brewer's clerk, for the &s;uppo&s;ed per&s;onal abu&s;e of a young woman; and, although the opponents of Mr. Coleman laboured to per&s;uade this young woman that Coleman was the per&s;on who treated her in that &s;can|dalous manner, yet, when they were in each others pre&s;ence, &s;he declared he was not the man. His ene|mies &s;till pre&s;&s;ed upon this young woman to change her opinion, a&s;&s;uring her that he was the offender; and as further interrogatories were put to her, re&s;pect|ing the circum&s;tances which had been alledged, &s;he gave a contradictory an&s;wer, which &s;eemed to imply that he was the man; &s;o the poor guilele&s;s pri&s;oner was thereby put into immediate confinement, and there &s;ecured till his trial came on, when he was condemned, and executed. About three years after this Mr. Cole|man's innocence was brought to light, and that as evident as the noon-day &s;un, the carman who drove him to the place of execution having been proved to be the man, and that by his own confe&s;&s;ion; he was therefore tried, condemned and executed, and one Mr. Delagourd, who was found perjured in Coleman's ca&s;e, was &s;entenced to &s;tand in the pillory oppo&s;ite St. George's church in the Borough. Afterwards he, with two others, who were concerned in the taking away Mr. Coleman's life, were tran&s;ported.</P>
<P>I return now to Mary Edmon&s;on, who, as before ob&s;erved, was tried by judge Denni&s;on upon mere cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="123" REF="126">
as no po&s;itive evidence again&s;t her could be produced. However, I under&s;tood that the pri&s;oner &s;uffered very &s;evere and rigorous treatment from the judge, becau&s;e &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon her innocence and integrity, the judge &s;till laying the murder to her charge, calling her a notorious vile wretch, a&s;&s;uring her that &s;he would be d&mdash;d if &s;he denied the fact, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> matters were &s;o evident, particularly &s;eeing that her apron and cap were found covered with blood in the copper-hole; yet, as &s;he was condemned on circum|&s;tances only, and as I attended her to the place of ex|ecution, I have every rea&s;on to believe &s;he was con|demned innocent of the charge.</P>
<P>Now as I was often prevented embracing the oppor|tunities of vi&s;iting this woman while in confine|ment, &s;o therefore I entertained no ideas, or even the lea&s;t intentions, of &s;eeing her &s;uffer; but as I was occa&s;ionally pa&s;&s;ing through the Borough, I chanced to call on one Mr. Skinner, a chee&s;emonger in that &s;treet, who earne&s;tly intreated me to attend the unfortunate Mary Edmon&s;on, that being the morning appointed for her execution. As he was a man very piou&s;ly in|clined, and one who &s;eemed deeply affected about the future &s;tate of her &s;oul, I therefore complied with his intreaties, although I was extremely fatigued by my long journey; and as he further ob&s;erved, that the unhapy woman had been brutally dealt with in the cour&s;e of her impri&s;onment, and al&s;o greatly hindered
<PB N="124" REF="127">
in making her peace with God, I immediately (con|&s;idering it a point of my duty) &s;et out for Kennington-Common, yet with very &s;light hopes of coming to the &s;peech of her before &s;he entered into her unchange|able &s;tate: but the Lord has his way in the whirl|wind. Some minutes, previous to my arrival at the Peacock, near the Common whereon &s;he was to &s;uffer, Thomas Tollis, the executioner, e&s;pied me in the mid&s;t of the mighty concour&s;e, and, filled with joy and tears, hurried through the croud, and &s;aid, "Mr. Told, I thank God you are come; pray follow me, and I will lead you to the room wherein &s;he will &s;hortly be confined; and, for God's &s;ake, &s;peak as clo&s;ely to her as you can." I followed him into the room, and, af|ter having tarried about the &s;pace of half an hour, I heard a violent &s;hout of "Here &s;he comes!" I then had recour&s;e to the window which looked into the road, and there perceived that the turbulent mob were univer|&s;ally combined in giving her a &s;hocking reception with extended mouths, throwing out the mo&s;t vile, terrible, and bla&s;phemous cur&s;es and oaths, impo&s;&s;ible to be pen'd or &s;et forth! nay, too horrible for reflection to dwell on! When the pri&s;oner was brought into the room, &s;he &s;tood with her back again&s;t the wain&s;cot; but appeared perfectly re&s;igned to the will of God. I then addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to her, &s;aying, "My dear, for God's &s;ake, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of your own precious &s;oul, do not die with a lie in your mouth! You are, in a few moments, to appear in the pre&s;ence
<PB N="125" REF="128">
of an Holy God, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. O con&s;ider what an eternity of mi&s;ery mu&s;t be, and this will be the certain portion of all who die in their &s;ins; therefore, if you are guilty, openly confe&s;s it; or if you were in any wi&s;e concerned in the murder, you are not clear before God, if you do not publicly acknowledge your guilt." She heard me with much meekne&s;s and &s;implicity; but an&s;wered, That &s;he had already advanced the truth, and hoped &s;he might per&s;evere in the &s;ame &s;pirit to her la&s;t moment Mr. Hammett, who was then chief keeper of the New-Pri&s;on, Borough, by order of the &s;heriff, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed every per&s;on from out of the room; and &s;aid to me, "Mr. Told, I am &s;en&s;ible of the bu&s;ine&s;s upon which you came hither; but mu&s;t beg you will quit the room, as no per&s;on is permitted to attend her without obtaining the &s;heriff's con&s;ent for that purpo&s;e;" but, upon Mr. Hammett's following me out, he intimated that the &s;heriff would grant me permi&s;&s;ion to attend her in the cart to the place of ex|ecution, if I deemed it prudent to a&s;k him.</P>
<P>The period of her departure for the gallows having arrived, I &s;olicited the &s;heriff to be&s;tow his approba|tion of my vi&s;iting her as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. He then a&s;ked me "if I was a clergyman?" I replied, "No, Sir." "Are you a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter?" I an&s;wer|ed, "No." "What are you then?" I informed him, that I was one who preached the Go&s;pel, and
<PB N="126" REF="129">
could wi&s;h to be the means of bringing the pri&s;oner to a confe&s;&s;ion. The &s;heriff at that bid me lay hold of his hor&s;e's bridle, and told me I &s;hould accompany her to the place of execution; yet he did not urge me to ru&s;h into that dangerous attempt immediately, &s;eeing the rioters were &s;o fiercely exa&s;perated again&s;t her. It was ob&s;erved to me by the &s;heriff, that a very great &s;atisfaction would be given to the nation in general, if I could be in&s;trumental in bringing her to a confe&s;&s;ion. Now, as we were proceeding on the road, the &s;heriff's hor&s;e being clo&s;e to the cart, I looked at her from under the hor&s;e's bridle, and &s;aid, "My dear, look to Je&s;us." This &s;alutary advice quickened her &s;pirit, in&s;omuch that, although &s;he did not look about her before, yet &s;he then turned her&s;elf round to me, and joyfully an&s;wered, "Sir, I ble&s;s God, I can look to Je&s;us to my comfort." This produced a plea&s;ant &s;mile in her countenance, which when the &s;ons of vio|lence perceived, they d&mdash;d her in a &s;hamele&s;s manner; this was accompanied with a vengeful &s;hout, "See how bold &s;he is! See how the L&mdash;h laughs!" At length we came to the tree, where many officers were &s;tationed on hor&s;eback, be&s;ides numbers more on foot furni&s;hed with con&s;tables &s;laves. When the cart was back|ed under the gallows, a very big and corpulent man (as I was in the mid&s;t of the hubbub) trod on my left foot with &s;uch fury and weight, that I really thought he had taken it quite off: However, the &s;heriff &s;oon cleared the way, and formed an arrangement of con|&s;tables
<PB N="127" REF="130">
round the cart, then directed &s;ome of them to put me thereinto, in order that I might be of all the &s;ervice to the malefactor which laid in my power; the &s;heriff him&s;elf &s;tanding behind the cart, the better to avail him&s;elf of my di&s;cour&s;e with her. When &s;he was tied up, I began to addre&s;s her nearly with the &s;ame words as I did at the Peacock, pre&s;&s;ing upon her (at the &s;ame time) an acknowledgement of the per|petration, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner I was capable of; but &s;he declared her innocence in pre&s;ence of the &s;heriff. I then interrogated her thus, "Did you not commit the fact? Had you no concern therein? Was you not intere&s;ted in the murder?" She an&s;wered, "I am as clear of the whole affair, as I was the day my mother brought me into the world." The &s;heriff, on hearing the&s;e words, &s;hed plenty of tears, and &s;aid, "Good God! it is a &s;econd Coleman's ca&s;e!" The circum&s;tance likewi&s;e brought tears from many per&s;ons who heard her. When I was getting out of the cart, the executioner put the handkerchief over her eyes; but &s;he quickly moved it away, and, addre&s;&s;ing her|&s;elf to the multitude, begged them to pray that God would bring to light, when &s;he was departed, the cau&s;e of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, &s;aying, that &s;he had no doubt that the prayers of &s;uch per&s;ons would be heard, as &s;he repeated her innocence, &s;olemnly declaring, that &s;he was as ignorant of the crime for which &s;he was going to &s;uffer, as at the day of her birth; and added al&s;o, "I do not lay any thing to the charge of my Maker, he has
<PB N="128" REF="131">
an undoubted right to take me out of this world as &s;eemeth him good; and, although I am clear of this murder, yet I have &s;inned again&s;t him in many grievous in&s;tances; but, I ble&s;s God, he hath forgiven me all my &s;ins." Her kin&s;man then came up into the cart, and would fain have &s;aluted her; but &s;he mildly turned her face a&s;ide, &s;trongly &s;u&s;pecting him to be the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, having frequent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y challenged him there|with at King&s;ton: This, I believe, will &s;hortly appear to the &s;atisfaction of my readers, that he was the very man, and the &s;ole cau&s;e of Mary's untimely end; but fir&s;t I purpo&s;e to fini&s;h with Mary.</P>
<P>After her kin&s;man was gone out of the cart the exe|cutioner, a &s;econd time, was putting the handkerchief over her face, which &s;he again turned a&s;ide, looking at the &s;heriff, and lamenting thus with meekne&s;s, "I think it cruel that none is &s;uffered to pray by me." The &s;heriff then de&s;ired me, for God's &s;ake, to go a &s;econd time into the cart, and renew my prayers with her, which, when fini&s;hed, Mary began to pray ex|tempore, and in a mo&s;t excellent manner; when &s;he had concluded her prayer, the executioner performed his part, and, being turned off, her body dropt again&s;t my right &s;houlder; nor did &s;he once &s;truggle or move, but was as &s;till as if &s;he had hung three hours. Upon her trial it was repre&s;ented, that &s;he cut all her fingers acro&s;s on both hands for a deception, in order to lay the murder upon &s;ome other per&s;on;
<PB N="129" REF="132">
but, in her defence upon trial, &s;he declared that her fingers were not cut by a knife; but, being alarmed, when &s;he entered the hou&s;e, at &s;eeing four men, one of whom was in a white frock; and al&s;o &s;eeing her aunt lay weltering in her own blood, &s;he, in con&s;e|quence thereof, made &s;omewhat of a &s;tartling motion, which, when the felons perceived, they all ran out of doors. Mary nece&s;&s;arily following them clo&s;e, caught the door with both her hands, and called out, "Murder;" but, by their pulling the door very hard, her eight fingers were thereby jammed almo&s;t off. When &s;he was executed, I noticed her fingers, went immediately and took a door, with which I jammed my fingers al&s;o, and found them to be marked exactly like hers.</P>
<P>I now return to the kin&s;man of Mary Edmon&s;on, who, upon the death of his aunt (as Mary and he were cou&s;ins) was intitled to &pound;100, left him by way of legacy, and likewi&s;e to Mary &pound;200. The kin&s;|man having received his, bought him&s;elf out of the army, as before he had been a foot &s;oldier. Some time after the execution of his kin&s;woman, he, with another man, hired a po&s;t-chai&s;e in the Borough, to go on a party of plea&s;ure to Croydon-Fair: Upon their return in the evening, Mary Edmon&s;on's kin&s;|man &s;aid to his friend in the chai&s;e, as pa&s;&s;ing Ken|nington gallows, "There is the place where my kin&s;|woman (Mary Edmon&s;on) was hung wrongfully!"
<PB N="130" REF="133">
The other (&s;truck by the a&s;&s;ertion) &s;aid, "Wrong|fully! How do you know &s;he was hung wrongfully?" "Becau&s;e" replied the kin&s;man, "I &s;hould have gone in her room." His companion, after a &s;hort conver|&s;ation, and among other que&s;tions, a&s;ked him where was the place of his abode? He an&s;wered, "In Hedge-Lane, Charing-Cro&s;s." Now, when they had put up the chai&s;e, the &s;uppo&s;ed friend of Mary's kin&s;man went that moment to ju&s;tice Hammond, in the Borough, who, being informed of what had pa&s;&s;ed, granted a warrant to apprehend him. He was accord|ingly apprehended, and committed to Newgate, where, at his reque&s;t, I vi&s;ited him. He then de&s;ired me to render him all the &s;piritual a&s;&s;i&s;tance I was able; but my in&s;tructions were lo&s;t in the in&s;tructions which he received at Newgate from his fellow criminals, having &s;peedily learnt how to act, and al&s;o the art of denying the confe&s;&s;ion he had made to his companion in the chai&s;e. Notwith&s;tanding he was removed by a habeas from Newgate to King&s;ton in Surry, and when the a&s;&s;izes commenced, he was tried before judge Denni|&s;on, who tried his kin&s;woman, Mary Edmon&s;on; but, as he &s;o artfully denied the charge, the judge frankly acquitted him: However, he &s;oon went on the high|way, and committed a robbery, and was taken, for which he was tried, ca&s;t, and condemned; but, I have been informed, judge Denni&s;on, to prevent c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">amours, got him a reprieve for tran&s;portation; &s;o that I have never heard of the villain &s;ince, which is now many years ago.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="134">I &s;hall next give an account of Mr. Harris, who was reported to be the flying highwayman. During his confinement, after &s;entence, he was both &s;tupid and hardened, inattentive to in&s;truction from the ordinary or my&s;elf. The morning of his execution, when he came out of his cell, he behaved as a man deprived of his &s;en&s;es; but, upon his entering the chapel, he be|came violent; &s;o that the Rev. Mr. Rowe was terribly affrighted, and thereupon ran for his life: However, I went to him, and, endeavouring to create a calm|ne&s;s in his temper, I &s;olemnly &s;et before him the awful eternity he was ju&s;t going to enter into; yet all the coun&s;el I gave him was as water &s;pilt on the ground; nor was the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of repentance to be &s;een in his countenance, or behaviour. The others that were &s;entenced to &s;uffer with him, by direction of the &s;heriffs, were ordered into the cart; yet the &s;ame dull|ne&s;s and &s;tupidity of mind was not removed from Mr. Harris; nor did he give the lea&s;t attention to what was &s;poke concerning him, until we had pa&s;&s;ed a little beyond Hatton-Garden: I then pre&s;&s;ed upon him to be &s;ilent and &s;till for the &s;pace of ten minutes, during which to be very cautious of &s;peaking a &s;ingle word; but to be fully ob&s;ervant in keeping the eye of his mind &s;teadfa&s;tly fixed upon the ever-ble&s;&s;ed and adora|ble Je&s;us, and to be&s;eech of him the forgivene&s;s of all his &s;ins. Hanging back his head on the cop&s;e of the cart, he &s;hut his eyes, and was profoundly &s;ilent for the &s;aid &s;pace of ten minutes, when, upon rai&s;ing
<PB N="132" REF="135">
him&s;elf up, the tears pouring down his cheeks, he clapped his hands together, and &s;aid, "Now I know the Lord Je&s;us has forgiven me all my &s;ins, and I have nothing to do but to die." He then bur&s;t into an extem|pore prayer, that the a&s;&s;embled populace might more di&s;tinctly hear him on both &s;ides, and continued happy to his la&s;t moments; but &s;olemnly denied the charge of his being the flying highwayman, as he never leaped a turnpike-gate in his life; though it was acknowledged by him that he had committed &s;everal highway robberies in his life-time.</P>
<P>The next per&s;on, of whom I &s;hall give a particular account, was one Ander&s;on, a poor abject labouring man, who&s;e character, before the following unfortu|nate affair happened, was unimpeachable, touching his indu&s;try, &s;obriety, and hone&s;ty. This poor man had a wife far gone with child, and a daughter about &s;even years old; but was totally de&s;titute of money, cloaths, and a &s;pot where to lay their heads, having been by one of their rigid creditors di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mean habitation they formerly held, and nece&s;&s;itated to lay on the floor in &s;uch per&s;ons apartments, as the good|ne&s;s of God had actuated with principles of humanity.</P>
<P>One morning Mr. Ander&s;on, having been a long time without employment, &s;aid to his wife, "My dear, I have a &s;trong inclination to go down upon the Quays, it may be the Lord will provide for me a loaf of bread,
<PB N="133" REF="136">
or &s;ome employment, whereby we may &s;u&s;tain our|&s;elves a little longer, or el&s;e we &s;hall peri&s;h with hunger. He accordingly went out, and that &s;peedily; but as the many attempts he had hitherto made were intirely fruitle&s;s, and finding that all re&s;ources had failed, a temptation entered into his mind to commence robber. In order to rai&s;e him&s;elf and family from that deepe&s;t &s;tate of penury and di&s;tre&s;s, he gave way to the temptation, and accordingly turned back, and went into Hoxton-Fields, where ca&s;ually meeting two wa&s;herwo|men, who were bringing home their clean linen, he, without bidding them &s;top, &s;aid to one, "Mi&s;tre&s;s, I want money." She replied, "I have only two-pence." Then, &s;aid he, "Give me that." After this exaction of two-pence, he addre&s;&s;ed the other, &s;aying, "You have got money, I know you have." The woman an&s;wered, "I have but four-pence." He exacted that likewi&s;e, and, in&s;en&s;ible of what might fol|low, &s;carce knowing what he did, he walked before them into town. When they arrived in Old-Street, the two women charged him with a con&s;table, and both de|clared that he &s;topped them in Hoxton-Fields, and formally robbed them of their money. He was, by rea&s;on of this information, committed to pri&s;on, tried, and ca&s;t at the Old-Bailey for death, with &s;everal others, who lay a con&s;iderable time under &s;entence be|fore the report was made to his Maje&s;ty. In the inte|rim poor Mrs. Ander&s;on, though big with her third
<PB N="134" REF="137">
child, made frequent vi&s;its to her hu&s;band, and, thro' the con&s;iderate intervention of &s;ome beneficent friends, &s;he was enabled to &s;upply him with &s;ufficient food, the pri&s;on allowance not being more than one pennyworth of bread per day. During the many years I attended the pri&s;oners, it is &s;carce within my remembrance to have &s;een an in&s;tance of &s;uch meek, loving, and ten|der &s;pirits, conjugally &s;ub&s;iding, as that which appeared &s;o admirably con&s;picuous in the countenance and de|portment of this poor man and his wife; indeed, they were naturally inclined to few words; but the woman, frequently &s;eating her&s;elf by her hu&s;band's &s;ide, and there throwing her arms around his neck, they would &s;hed mutual and &s;ympathetic floods of tears, to miti|gate the great angui&s;h which, at their &s;everal inter|views, regularly overwhelmed their united hearts: But it is impo&s;&s;ible to do ju&s;tice to their exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility and tender affection. When I called all the pri&s;oners into the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s-yard room, they behaved with the deepe&s;t attention; nor do I remember to have made them one vi&s;it, but I ever found their &s;ouls to be greatly profited by m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> exhortations. I may further ob&s;erve, this was the ca&s;e with all the others then under confinement, in &s;ome mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mr. Ander&s;on, &s;ome time before the death warrant came down, was both convinced of &s;in, and al&s;o clearly &s;en&s;ible of the remi&s;&s;ion of his &s;ins. The morning of his execution having arrived, I attended him a little
<PB N="135" REF="138">
pa&s;t &s;ix o'clock, and, upon his being let down from his cell, found him to be exceedingly happy in his mind, telling me he had no doubt of his &s;alvation, and that he &s;hould &s;hortly be with Je&s;us, whom his &s;oul loved; and added, "This is the happie&s;t day I ever &s;aw in my life; Oh! who can expre&s;s the joy and peace I now feel: If I could have all the world I would not wi&s;h to live another day!" Notwith&s;tanding the mini&s;ter, churchwardens and over&s;eers, with &s;everal others of St. Luke's pari&s;h, pre&s;ented various petitions to his Maje&s;ty on his behalf, and though he had received an honourable character from the captain of the man of war, whereto he formerly belonged, and from which he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">larly di&s;charged, yet, when his ca&s;e was under the con&s;ideration of the Privy-Council, by a wrong in|formation which they received, that he was the Ander&s;on, who was an audacious highwayman at that time on the roads, he was included in the dead warrant.</P>
<P>Now as I was going in the cart with him to the place of execution, well knowing the mi&s;erable &s;ituation of his wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, I enq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ired of him where &s;he was to be found; to which he a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;wered, "I can give you no kind of in|telligence where, &s;eeing &s;he has no place of abode; but &s;ays on the floor in &s;ome poor per&s;on's dwelling|hou&s;e, movin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the is compelled by nece&s;&s;ity; therefore I am uncertain where &s;he may be found or heard of."

He told me in Lamb-Alley, Bi&s;hop&s;gate-Street. Now finding that the Lord had &s;trengthened my wi&s;hes to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, I &s;pent therefore three days in grovelling through almo&s;t every dirty alley in that neighbourhood; and, after having almo&s;t re&s;igned every hope of coming to the knowledge of her then place of abode, I at the la&s;t received information of her, whereby it was a&s;cer|tained that &s;he dwelt in Holywell-Lane. I went there accordingly, and found her in a melancholy &s;ituation, &s;itting with a poor old woman; when, looking into the room, I &s;aw no other furniture than a piece of an old rug, whereon they both laid them&s;elves to &s;leep; the room al&s;o was, I verily believe, more nau&s;eous than the cells of Newgate. When I had &s;poken a few words, I gave Mrs. Ander&s;on &s;trict directions to call at my hou&s;e, in Chri&s;topher's-Alley. She came, but not without much fear, imagining I had &s;omewhat to &s;ay again&s;t her. As I was engaged in other employ|ment when &s;he came to my hou&s;e, my wife happened to conver&s;e with her, and as Mrs. Told always had a very tender heart towards the poor, &s;he put two &s;hil|lings into the poor woman's hand, bidding her come in and take a dinner. In the cour&s;e of their conver|&s;ation, my wife ob&s;erved to Mrs. Ander&s;on that I only wanted to do her all the good that was in my power. The next night I was appointed to preach at our chapel in Old-Gravel-Lane, where, in my di&s;cour&s;e, I re|pre&s;ented to the congregation the unfortunate ca&s;e of Mr. Ander&s;on, who died for &s;ix pence, being the fir&s;t
<PB N="137" REF="140">
crime, if criminal, which I think not, were circum|&s;tances con&s;idered. I al&s;o &s;et forth the afflicted and deplorable &s;ituation of his wife. Now, although the congregation that evening was but &s;mall, and tho&s;e chiefly poor people, yet they contributed to her relief &s;ix and twenty &s;hillings; and, by laying her ca&s;e before others, I got as much as clothed her decently. As &s;he continued with me I perceived &s;he began to grow near her time; I therefore a&s;ked her if &s;he could give me an account of the pari&s;h &s;he properly belonged to, telling her I would get a petition &s;igned by Doctor Wathen, one of the governors of the London lying-in-ho&s;pital, to provide &s;ome kind of an a&s;ylum for her reception; but the poor woman, not having any knowledge of her hu&s;band's pari&s;h, I was on that ac|count obliged to commit her as one of the ca&s;ual poor on the pari&s;h of Shoreditch, Doctor Wathen informing me &s;he could not be admitted into the London lying-in-ho&s;pital without a &s;ecurity from the pari&s;h, to receive the child in ca&s;e of her death. I waited on the prin|cipal church-warden; but, he being ab&s;ent, I repaired to the dwelling-hou&s;e of the other, who ridiculed and abu&s;ed me in a mo&s;t &s;candalous manner indeed, altho' I had already repre&s;ented to him the lamentable &s;tate of Mrs. Ander&s;on, a&s;&s;uring him that her life would be lo&s;t for want of attention, being left intirely de&s;titute of money or clothing. The &s;avage replied, "I &s;up|po&s;e it is &s;ome woman you have got with child, and you want to father it upon the pari&s;h:" For this I paid
<PB N="138" REF="141">
him a compliment, and told him, "I lived but a few doors from him, that my character was well known, and that if he cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to inquire thereinto, he would, in my opinion, find him&s;elf mi&s;taken." He then &s;aid, in a &s;urly manner, "Then I &s;uppo&s;e it is &s;ome hang'd man's widow or other." I quickly took my leave of him, a&s;&s;uring him, that I &s;hould &s;eek no further relief from one who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e unhand&s;ome behaviour rendered him inco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">petent to give any. I ha&s;tened then immediately to a gentle|man of mine own corre&s;pondence, who maintained a clo&s;e acquaintance with the upper church-warden, and informed him of the unkind, and al&s;o ungenteel be|haviour of the other, with the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> poor Mrs. Ander&s;on. Now the upper church-warden, who &s;eemed to be of a mo&s;t excellent polite and benevolent &s;pirit, and de&s;ired my friend to &s;end her to his apart|ments the next morning by eight o'clock. She waited on him accordingly, and made her&s;elf known. He ordered her in, and gave her a good breakfa&s;t, while he &s;igned her petition: When he had &s;o done, he ordered her to carry it to the under church-warden to &s;ign it al&s;o, at who&s;e peril it would be to refu&s;e her, &s;eeing the upper church-warden had previou&s;ly &s;igned it. As &s;oon as her petition was &s;igned, &s;he attended at the ho&s;pital in Alder&s;gate-Street, and was accordingly admitted, where in a few days &s;he was delivered of a fine girl. When her month was clap&s;ed, my wife received her into our own hou&s;e, with the child, and &s;he continued there for many months, performing her daily bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="139" REF="142">
indu&s;triou&s;ly, with all the &s;obriety and cleanline&s;s ima|ginable; nay with much more than could be expected or de&s;ired from a woman in her mi&s;ery of mind. This exertion of her ability was manife&s;ted by way of a requital of our former kindne&s;&s;es. Some time after her child died, and as my wife was able to tran&s;act her daily occa&s;ions without Mrs. Ander&s;on's immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I did, at Mrs. Told's reque&s;t, procure a hou&s;ekeeper's place for her, where &s;he gave great &s;atisfaction, and &s;oon became a creditable, re&s;pected woman. I al&s;o bound her daughter an apprentice to a weaver, and have never &s;een her &s;ince but twice, which is &s;ome years ago.</P>
<P>Some time after Mr. Ander&s;on's execution, I at|tended Mr. Powell, who was ca&s;t for forgery: He was much of the gentleman, as well as a very per&s;onable man. The only ob&s;ervation I have to make on his behaviour is, that during his confinement, &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and devotion were truly con&s;picuous in him. He never feared to in&s;truct his brethren under his unhappy &s;ituation; &s;o that, by his upright walking in the fear of God, a &s;olemn awe was laid on the minds of tho&s;e his fellow &s;ufferers. When the day appointed for exe|cution arrived, the &s;heriff indulged him with a coach, and bade me get therein, that I might di&s;pen&s;e my &s;piritual labour to his invaluable &s;oul. I accordingly exerted my&s;elf to the utmo&s;t in giving him this kind of help; and afterwards went to the other malefactors,
<PB N="140" REF="143">
who were conveyed in carts, and there attended them al&s;o, imparting &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages of &s;criptural a&s;&s;i&s;tance to them. Mr. Powell's mind was &s;taid upon God in &s;o &s;teadfa&s;t a manner, that after we had &s;ung an hymn, and concluded our prayers, he clo&s;ed his eyes, and earne&s;tly intreated me to decline my di&s;cour&s;e with him, in order that he might be the better enabled to medi|tate on God and an awful eternity. At the place of execution they all behaved with that penitence and &s;o|lemnity, naturally expected of men going into an un|changeable &s;tate, therefore, I humbly hope, they are all lodged in Immanuel's brea&s;t.</P>
<P>In the next place I &s;hall &s;peak of a Mr. Gib&s;on, an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, who was &s;entenced to death for forgery. He w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an emin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt character in his profe&s;&s;ion, portly and hand&s;ome in his per&s;on. In re&s;pect to religious prin|ciples he had been very wavering and irre&s;olute, ever learning, but never coming to the perfect knowledge of the truth; &s;ometimes he inclined to the Romi&s;h church, at other times he would conform to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church of England; then he would go to the Methodi&s;ts; and &s;ometimes he held with the Di&s;&s;enters of various denominations; but I &s;oon became ac|quainted with his motives for this kind of doctrine hunting, viz. that it aro&s;e from pecuniary views, and lucrative de&s;ires; this I learnt by his own acknow|ledgement. He frequently attended my exhortations with the re&s;t under &s;entence, always expre&s;&s;ing much
<PB N="141" REF="144">
&s;atisfaction thereby: I al&s;o made him repeated vi&s;its to his own room, on the ma&s;ter's &s;ide, where he always readily received me, and that with expre&s;&s;ions of great plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Upon his trial his cau&s;e had been referred to the twelve judges. After 15 months confinement he di&s;|patched his wife to one of the judges to know if a determination of his cau&s;e was nearly on the carpet. The judge an&s;wered, "If Mr. Gib&s;on is in &s;o great a hurry to know this, you may acquaint him, that his cau&s;e has been, after mature con&s;ideration and weight, finally determined, and he will not find it altogether &s;atisfactory." His wife went back without lo&s;s of time, and acquainted him with the information given her by the judge; yet he &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a kind of inattentive carele&s;&s;ne&s;s: However, the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ions he was &s;um|moned to the bar, there to plead to his &s;entence, in pre&s;ence of four judges on the bench. Permi&s;&s;ion was granted him to make his own defence, and, as I was pre&s;ent during the whole time, it was a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment on my part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o hear his learned and rhe|torical arguments; al&s;o the many di&s;putable points of law referred to from various books and acts of parlia|ment: Indeed, I really believe it was the univer&s;al opinion of the a&s;&s;embly that he would be immediately cleared, as none of the judges were able to confute him. At length judge Parrot ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and, addre&s;&s;ing Mr. Gib&s;on with a lofty air, told him (and
<PB N="142" REF="145">
beg'd he would take notice) that his crime had been well con&s;idered by the twelve judges, and that they had unanimou&s;ly con&s;idered him guilty, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g, "My brethren here pre&s;ent maintain the &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> opinions." Mr. Gib&s;on, on hearing this, turned as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as death, and was &s;carcely able to &s;tand. He was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> commit|ted to his cell, and clo&s;ely confined the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> where he &s;oon &s;hook off the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">man Catholick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and by turns a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> different f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s who often vi&s;ited him.

When the report came down that Mr. Gib&s;on was included in the dead war|rant, he was &s;hockingly alarmed, and began to be more in earne&s;t, inquiring of me, in an agony of &s;pi|rit, what he mu&s;t do to be &s;aved. I applied th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture at fir&s;t which were the mo&s;t awakening to his con&s;cience, and I believe they were not utterly in vain: When I perceived his &s;oul was in extreme angui&s;h and bitterne&s;s, then, and not till then, I pointed him to the Lamb of God, who was ever waiting to be gracious to every returning prodi|gal: I al&s;o applied tho&s;e healing portions of God's mo&s;t Holy Word, which were mo&s;t conducive to his pre&s;ent and eternal happine&s;s. The awful day came
<PB N="143" REF="146">
whereon he was appointed to die; nor did I perceive any mark or token of a change in his &s;oul. On going to the place of execution his mind was greatly agita|ted, as life is precious and eternity awful beyond conception, e&s;pecially when both are &s;o very near; yet no one could be more diligent in making &s;erious in|quiries of what might be mo&s;t beneficial to his im|mortal &s;pirit. When we arrived at the fatal &s;pot, he turned to me (being greatly terrified) and &s;aid, "Oh! Mr. Told, I be&s;eech you give me all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance you po&s;&s;ibly can," which, through the enlivening guidance of Almighty God, I was enabled to do, and in con&s;equence whereof, he appeared to be much more compo&s;ed and re&s;igned to his fate. I hope our Lord and Saviour was propitious to his never-dying &s;oul. I endeavoured to be equally &s;erviceable to all the re&s;t, who were apparently in a better &s;tate to leave this world than Mr. Gib&s;on.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now &s;peak of a few of the cutters among the weavers; three of them I &s;hall mention in particular, viz. Doyle, Valine, and Me&s;&s;man. The night Me&s;&s;|man was brought to Newgate, in order to be &s;ettered, he di&s;covered me at &s;ome di&s;tance, and, approaching me, he &s;aid, "Mr. Told, I know you very well," and added, crying, "I am afraid I &s;hall &s;uffer, there|fore hoped I would attend him both before and after his trial, and give him all the in&s;truction I was capable of." I accordingly imparted to him &s;uch pieces of in&s;truction as he &s;eemed to &s;tand in the mo&s;t need of;
<PB N="144" REF="147">
and, although he was a man of an undaunted &s;pirit, hand&s;ome, and of a tolerable good under&s;tanding, yet he was &s;oon brought into &s;ubjection to the Father of &s;pirits; and every vi&s;it I afterwards paid him, he gave fre&s;h evidence of deeper conviction of &s;in, a clearer knowledge of him&s;elf, his deep fall from God, and his lo&s;t &s;tate. His conver&s;ion was very &s;ingular, being quickly changed from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;in and &s;atan unto God, which was evidently perceived by all around him. Before I conclude with Mr. Me&s;&s;man, and his calm and peaceable exit, I judge it no wi&s;e improper, but rather nece&s;&s;ary, to render an exact account of Doyle and Valine, who were executed on Bethnal-Green, by the decree of government, and in the &s;heriffalty of aldermen Town|&s;end and Sawbridge.</P>
<P>I have but two remarks to make concerning them, nor can I repre&s;ent any thing con&s;iderable re&s;pecting their attention to things of eternity. It is true a few favourable circum&s;tances were manife&s;ted in their behaviour; and, at Mr. Doyle's reque&s;t, I wrote two or three petitions to his Maje&s;ty, and twice obtained a re&s;pite; but, unfortunately for them, an order after|wards appeared to &s;end them away for execution. Here I endeavoured to per&s;uade Mrs. Doyle to carry another petition; but &s;he replied, with ridiculous un|concern, "There is no occa&s;ion for it, I am very clear he will not die." By what I gathered after this, the
<PB N="145" REF="148">
woman's meaning was, he would a&s;&s;uredly be re&s;cued by the weavers upon their arrival at Bethnal-Green; and, without doubt, the&s;e were the &s;ecret intentions of the riotous mob, as was realized by a watch word which, on a &s;udden, was diffu&s;ed all over the Green! Stones then began to fly from every quarter. Now, as I was with the officiating ordinary in a coach, a me&s;|&s;enger was di&s;patched from the &s;heriff, giving my companion in the coach to under&s;tand, that no time for prayers or devotion would be allotted them, neither would there be any occa&s;ion for either of us; that as &s;oon as the gibbet, which was in the cart with them, was come to the place appointed, they were to be la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nched off immediately. Mr. Valine, greatly ter|fied, begged heartily that one prayer might be offered up to God for them; but that not being granted, they were turned off in the utmo&s;t hurry and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Me&s;&s;man, and others of the cutters, were &s;hortly after executed at Tyburn; but Me&s;&s;man, apprehen&s;ive that the combination of weavers purpo&s;ed a re&s;cue, and he b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing very happy in his &s;oul, addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf, when in the cart, to the &s;pectators, &s;aying, with a &s;trong voice, "Gentlemen, I humbly intreat you to keep as much &s;ilence as is po&s;&s;ible; we could wi&s;h to go to our everla&s;ting home in peace and quietne&s;s, being happy enough to leave this world without the lea&s;t de|&s;ire of living any longer herein;" nor did we endure any tumult any part of the way, or at the place of ex|cution.
<PB N="146" REF="149">
Their behaviour was all &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and devotion, for which I have &s;trong hopes that they are at re&s;t from &s;in and &s;orrow, and become partakers of everla&s;ting glory.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next give a brief account of Mr. Bolland, a &s;heriff's officer, who had frequently attended the male|factors at Tyburn; he was condemned for forging an endor&s;ement on the back of a promi&s;&s;ory note: His character was al&s;o, in many other in&s;tances, &s;adly &s;tain|ed, &s;o that the con&s;ideration of the latter, added to the former offence, together with an ob&s;ervation made by one of the judges on the frequency thereof in the mercantile world, proved the tran&s;action too weighty to keep him upon &s;ufficient grounds for &s;elf vindication; otherwi&s;e (as I had been informed) the mere forgery it&s;elf would not have been altogether heavy enough to bring him, by impartial ju&s;tice, to &s;o awful a &s;ituation.</P>
<P>When Bolland fir&s;t found that his life was clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, he immediately refunded the money; yet his pro&s;ecutors would by no means deliver up the note: He then informed me that his pro&s;ecutors exacted of him a &s;econd payment of the money, and finding his life &s;till in danger, he paid that al&s;o, upon their giving him an indemnification under their hands, obliging them&s;elves to cancel the endor&s;ement; and, as he was per&s;uaded they would act with principles of honour,
<PB N="147" REF="150">
he therefore paid no further attention to their proceed|ings; however they refu&s;ed at la&s;t to efface the in|dor&s;ement.</P>
<P>His trial came on, and he was ca&s;t, and then com|mitted to his cell, where he lay a long time, but gave very little attention to his &s;piritual concerns. His poor wife took every opportunity to make all the intere&s;t &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could. When the dead|warrant came down, and Mr. Bolland included therein, he was &s;o engaged in writing petitions, &amp;c. that he could not, neither would he, &s;et apart a few moments for the endeavours to &s;ecure his &s;oul, which gave me great unea&s;ine&s;s. I frequently told him, how dreadfully dangerous it was to be &s;o anxious concern|ing his body, while his &s;oul was intirely neglected: He made many promi&s;es, but performed very few of them. A day or two previous to his execution, his wife waited on their Maje&s;ties at the play-hou&s;e, where &s;he gave a petition into each of their hands. His Maje&s;ty, in con&s;equence of the petition, &s;ent for the recorder, and told him that he had a great inclination to &s;pare Bolland's life. The recorder replied to his Maje&s;ty, that if he &s;pared his life, who&s;e character was truly infamous and baneful, he would &s;pare as great a villain as any in the nation. It mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved, I &s;peak this only from the information which I received.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="151">On the morning of his execution I went early to the cell, and laboured very much with Mr. Bolland, who betrayed a violent agitation of mind. When we had entered the chapel he exhibited the mo&s;t &s;erious atten|tion, and was well plea&s;ed to hear in&s;truction. As he had very little knowledge of the way to eternal life, &s;o he was the more intent upon, and earne&s;t in &s;earch|ing after, tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, which might furni&s;h him with any hopes of being &s;aved. The or|dinary, my&s;elf, and other &s;piritual friends, u&s;ed our utmo&s;t endeavours to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in that road to eternal life. When he was in the cart, going to the place of execution, he &s;carcely cea&s;ed a &s;ingle minute in a&s;king me what he mu&s;t do to be &s;aved; and, at the cri&s;is of his di&s;&s;olution, he repeated the &s;ame. I can only leave him to a merciful Redeemer, hoping he is &s;afely lodged in the arms of his Love.</P>
<P>The next, of whom I would &s;peak, was a young gentleman, Mr. Slocomb, who was executed for de|frauding his father of &pound;300 in the &s;tock of the South-Sea-Hou&s;e; much of the gentleman and &s;cholar was evident in the behaviour of this youth. Upon his father's coming up to London to receive his intere&s;t-money, he was informed that his &s;on brought his draft for &pound;300, which money he received, and the &s;um debited to his father's account. Mr. Slocomb, &s;enior, declared he never gave his &s;on any &s;uch draft, and therefore in&s;i&s;ted upon the receipt of his whole in|tere&s;t.
<PB N="149" REF="152">
The gentlemen at the office perceiving the young man's life in danger, acquainted his father of the circum&s;tances; telling him al&s;o, if he would not abide the lo&s;s, they mu&s;t be under the nece&s;&s;ity of apprehending his &s;on, who would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly &s;uffer death. The father would by no means &s;uffer the lo&s;s, accordingly the youth was apprehended. He was afterwards brought upon his trial, where he was condemned, and received &s;entence of death: The lump of adamant (his father) then retired to his own country, nor would he after that, &s;ee or hear from his &s;on; neither did he once write to him, or give him any kind of advice, or remit him any degree of relief, not|with&s;tanding he lay a long time under &s;entence, be|fore he was ordered for execution. Something re|markably amiable I perceived in his conduct, viz. In the fir&s;t place, an intire re&s;ignation to the will of God, which kept down every murmuring thought, and in|tirely prevented his making any complaint again&s;t the &s;everity of his father, who deviated &s;o cruelly from paternal duty.</P>
<P>And &s;econdly, in his behaviour during his confine|ment; this al&s;o was admirable, he being filled with perfect &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and devotion, occa&s;ion'd (I may ven|ture to &s;ay) by the clo&s;e attention he duly gave to my in&s;truction and repeated exhortations. In &s;hort, he never neglected to attend on the means of grace at every opportunity. Mr. Powell, a fine young gentle|man,
<PB N="150" REF="153">
who was &s;entenced at the &s;ame time for forgery, became a companion of Mr. Slocomb's; they con|&s;tantly conver&s;ed together about the awful things of eternity, and were both truly in&s;tructive to other ma|lefactors. They were both much lamented by all who knew them, even the mo&s;t di&s;tant of their acquaint|ance. As their whole demeanour was grounded on the ba&s;is of godline&s;s, they, on the awful hour, mutually exhibited &s;o excellent a mea&s;ure of that happy &s;pirit, that I am firmly per&s;uaded in my mind, tho&s;e, who clo&s;ely examined their conduct when on the brink of eternity, could entertain no doubt of their eternal ac|ceptance with God.</P>
<P>The next account which I &s;hall give, is that of Mary Pyner, who was &s;entenced to death for &s;etting fire to her ma&s;ter's hou&s;e. At the &s;ame time three or four men were ca&s;t for death, with whom Mary endeavoured to contract a very wanton intercour&s;e; but they ap|peared to be on their important guard every moment of their confinement, behaving with much penitence and contrition of &s;pirit; therefore the enemy of their &s;ouls could not inject his fatal poi&s;on into the minds of tho&s;e, by the means of Mary's ungovernable folly. I &s;trove to make this young woman the greate&s;t and fir&s;t object of my vi&s;it; but experienced various repul&s;es from her|&s;elf, as well as others; I was grieved to behold this heed|le&s;&s;ne&s;s in her conduct, e&s;pecially as the dead-warrant had ju&s;t arrived, wherein &s;he was included. However, at
<PB N="151" REF="154">
length, I took her a&s;ide into the pre&s;s-yard-room, and &s;aid to her, "Mary, how is it that you in particular, above all the other malefactors, are &s;o regardle&s;s about your precious and immortal &s;oul? Do not you very well know that God's all-&s;eeing eye penetrates your rude behaviour towards the men? Are you not afraid of going to hell, &s;eeing you are in a &s;hort time to ap|pear before the great Jehovah, again&s;t whom you are now &s;inning with an high hand? Are you determined to de&s;troy your own &s;oul, your everla&s;ting happine&s;s, and your All; What, are you in love with eternal per|dition, and God's wrath, that you &s;o madly pur&s;ue it? And do you long to be involved in the bottomle&s;s pit, and the lake that burns with fire and brim&s;tone, which will never be quenched? Oh! remember, if you die in your pre&s;ent condition, you will die eternally under the wrath of an offended Saviour; and all the&s;e mi&s;eries, attended with greater plagues, will be your portion for ever!" Mary lent a particular and calm attention to what I &s;aid concerning her, and replied, "Mr. Told, I have had &s;ome knowledge of you, having many times heard you preach at We&s;t-Street chapel." At this I was greatly a&s;toni&s;hed, and a&s;ked her what could be her rea&s;ons, when &s;he had heard the Go&s;pel preached, to be guilty of &s;o heinous a crime as &s;etting fire to her ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, and afterwards to rob him of his property. She an&s;wered, the devil was too powerful for her in the temptation. Now I perceived that a change in her countenance and behaviour com|menced
<PB N="152" REF="155">
from that moment; nor did I hear one unbe|coming expre&s;&s;ion, or ob&s;erve an indi&s;creet action, to her la&s;t moment; and, as her time was &s;hort in this tran&s;itory world, I was the more intent on her future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The night prior to her execution, I importunately be&s;ought her to &s;pend every moment in wre&s;tling mightily with God for pardon, through his dearly be|loved Son, that, for his &s;ake, all her &s;ins might be blot|ted out as a cloud, and her manifold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions as a thick cloud; to which &s;he an&s;wered, "God being my helper, I am determined not to clo&s;e my eyes the whole night." Similar advice I gave to all the re&s;t of the malefactors, one of whom e&s;pou&s;ed the like re|&s;olution. I then de&s;ired the inner keepers to lock them all up in one cell, that they might pour out their joint &s;upplications to the awful and tremendous Judge of quick and dead, in who&s;e pre&s;ence they mu&s;t all una|voidably appear in a few fleeting moments! This was readily granted, &s;o they accordingly devoted that night to an inexpre&s;&s;ible advantage, by praying, &s;ing|ing hymns, and rejoicing, the Lord God him&s;elf being evidently in the mid&s;t of them. When I re|turned to them the next morning, and after having received this &s;oul-reviving information, I begged the keepers to unlock the cells, and lead them down into the pre&s;s-yard. The fir&s;t that came out was Mary Pyner. I was &s;truck with joy and delight when I
<PB N="153" REF="156">
beheld the happy change in her countenance. As &s;he came out of the cell door, which led into the pre&s;s-yard, &s;he appeared to be filled with the peace and love of God, when, clapping her hands together with plea&s;ant energy, &s;he gave a triumphant &s;hout with the&s;e words, "This night God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, has forgiven me all my &s;ins; I know that I have pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life, and by twelve o'clock I &s;hall be with my Redeemer in the world of glory." When the &s;ervice and Sacrament was concluded, they all came down from chapel, and were ordered into the pre&s;s-yard-room, where I continued praying for, and exhorting them all nearly the &s;pace of forty minutes, when directions were given to bring them out, and place them in two carts. Mary Pyner, accompanied by two other malefactors and my&s;elf, went in the fir&s;t cart. While we were on our pa&s;&s;age to the place of execution, I frequently exhorted them to keep the eye of their mind &s;tedfa&s;tly looking up to Je&s;us, u&s;ing many repetitions of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, which I con&s;idered be&s;t adapted to their awful &s;ituation. Here I am &s;trongly per&s;uaded my labour was not in vain, particularly &s;o in the &s;oul of Mary, who abided in the happy &s;pirit of faith, &s;inging, prai&s;ing, and giving glory to God without intermi&s;&s;ion, from the moment I addre&s;&s;ed them till they arrived at the tree. Mary then acco&s;ted one of her companions in &s;uffering, who cried vehemently, and in great angui&s;h of &s;oul, &s;aying, "Lord Je&s;us forgive me my &s;ins! God be merciful to
<PB N="154" REF="157">
me a &s;inner;" and &s;he &s;aid to him, "Do you believe Je&s;us Chri&s;t died for you?" He replied, truly I do." Then &s;aid Mary, "There is no room left for a doubt of your &s;alvation." This produced a glorious revival of his &s;pirit, which continued with him till his la&s;t breath.</P>
<P>When the cart was put under the gallows, Mary was the fir&s;t that bore the rope: As &s;oon as this was done, &s;he turned round to an innumerable a&s;&s;embly of people on both &s;ides, &s;aying, "Good people, I doubt not that many of you are greatly affected at beholding &s;o young a creature as I am brought to this unhappy and &s;hameful end; but, Oh! I am as happy as I can bear to be, having full a&s;&s;urance that I &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l live with him who died for me, and there commence an everla&s;t|ing banquet of greater happine&s;s at his right-hand, in the region of endle&s;s Pa adi&s;e." She then began to &s;trengthen her fellow-&s;ufferers, be&s;eeching them not to doubt of the readine&s;s of God to &s;ave them. I rejoiced, in hope that they all received that great &s;alvation, purcha&s;ed by the blood of the everla&s;ting covenant. When duty was clo&s;ed, they were all turned off, crying for mercy of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Amen.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now give a plain &s;imple relation of the un|fortunate Mrs Brownrigg, in order to furni&s;h my readers with a view of her di&s;quietudes, and her &s;hocking &s;ituation during her impri&s;onment. The Rt.
<PB N="155" REF="158">
Hon. the Lord-Mayor having been plea&s;ed to favor me with an order to Mr. Akerman (the keeper of Newgate) for granting me permi&s;&s;ion to attend her while confined therein, for the cruel and wilful mur|der of her apprentice girl, Mary Clifford, Septem|ber 4th, 1767.</P>
<P>I went there accordingly, on the evening &s;ub&s;equent to the above direction, and was conducted to the room where Mrs. Brownrigg was &s;itting on her bed&s;ide, ac|companied by a poor woman. I addre&s;&s;ed her in the mo&s;t awful and &s;triking manner I was capable of, and withal told her, that I came by order of the Lord-Mayor, and in the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; therefore ob&s;erved, if &s;he would accept of my &s;ervices as a &s;piritual vi&s;itor, I &s;hould con&s;ider it as my duty to &s;peak my mind on this occa&s;ion, as fully and clo&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible, e&s;pecially as I had heard very dreadful ac|counts of her conduct. She replied, "Mr. Told, I am very glad to &s;ee you, and &s;hall not e&s;teem you my friend, if you do not deal with plainne&s;s towards me, and &s;peak as home and clo&s;e as you can. Happy was I to hear her &s;peak thus, and &s;aid to her, "Mrs Brown|rigg, you are in an awful &s;ituation before man, but more e&s;pecially before the Almighty God; your mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;ins are within his immediate view, &s;o that you can hide nothing from his all-&s;eeing eye: Your character al&s;o, in the eye of the world, is rendered loathed and horrible, as you are charged with crimes of the deepe&s;t
<PB N="156" REF="159">
dye, to many of which I can &s;carcely allow any degree of credibility: However, matters appear too evident in regard to the fact for which you are convicted." I likewi&s;e told her, "I very much feared &s;he had but little mercy upon her late fellow creature; that &s;he had cruelly u&s;ed the decea&s;ed repeatedly, and for &s;ome length of time!" Her an&s;wer was, "I acknow|ledge this accu&s;ation, &s;o far as to have given the girl repeated corrections, but no farther; my intentions being directly oppo&s;ite to any kind of violence." I then ob&s;erved to her, that I did not believe &s;he was &s;timu|lated by &s;o fierce a &s;pirit of anger, as to be driven to the immediate perpetration of murder; but I added al&s;o, "What were your ideas of the dreadful con&s;equences, which mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue, from &s;uch &s;hocking acts of cruelty, too &s;hocking to nature?" She replied, "Sir, if I had any con&s;ideration of the danger thereof, I could not have done the deed; the devil reigned with a fatal ma&s;tery over me" I then told her, the Word of God expre&s;sly declares, "Who&s;o &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed;" therefore I had no doubt that her life would go for the life of the poor child. She replied, "I have no doubt of it neither." Here I began to addre&s;s her with a more pointed con|ver&s;ation, and &s;aid to her, "If you are thus con&s;cious of your guilt, there is no time to lo&s;e; immediately then lay your dreadful ca&s;e before God, under a deep &s;en&s;e of the &s;in you have committed, and not for that only, but for all and every of your actual &s;ins, from
<PB N="157" REF="160">
the earlie&s;t period of your life to the pre&s;ent moment, or you can have no ju&s;t hopes of mercy at the hand of God, through the merits of a crucified Redeemer, as we are confidently a&s;&s;ured he came into the world to &s;ave us <HI>from</HI> our &s;ins, not <HI>in</HI> them:" Therefore I continued to in&s;i&s;t upon it, unle&s;s &s;he humbled her&s;elf under the mighty hand of God by a heart-felt repen|tance, and an open acknowledgement of tho&s;e flagrant crimes &s;he had been guilty of, no favor could be af|forded to her unhappy &s;oul by the hand of God in the day of judgement, nor would &s;he con&s;equently have peace of mind while on earth. "This," &s;aid Mrs. Brownrigg, "I firmly believe." I then further ad|ded, "that I did not come to extort any confe&s;&s;ion from her, and beg'd &s;he would confe&s;s nothing to me;" but I ob&s;erved to her, "You will, in a few days, be brought upon your trial, when you will not only be in the pre&s;ence of the judge and jury, but al&s;o in the more immediate pre&s;ence of the all-&s;eeing God; and witne&s;&s;es will be called for to give evidence again&s;t you; then more e&s;pecially will be the time when it behoves you to &s;peak the truth; and I charge you therefore, at the peril of your &s;oul, not to advance any thing again&s;t the dictates of your own con&s;cience, in covering your crimes, the guilt of which you know before God you are not exempt from; but I pray you adhere firmly to the truth, &s;hould death be the con&s;e|quence." She replied, "I intend it." I again ad|vi&s;ed her to reject, as much as po&s;&s;ibly &s;he could, the
<PB N="158" REF="161">
&s;ugge&s;tions of the enemy, in covering her crimes; but to be frankly ingenuous in the acknowledgement there|of before proper magi&s;trates: I then clo&s;ed my fir&s;t vi&s;it with prayer, after having given her, agreeable to her &s;olicitations, all the &s;piritual a&s;&s;i&s;tance within the limits of my capacity. When fini&s;hed, I parted with her, and the next day (being Sunday) I vi&s;ited her again, about twelve o'clock, a&s;king her how &s;he found her&s;elf, as I perceived her &s;pirits to be greatly depre&s;&s;ed. She replied, "Mr. Told, &s;ince you was with me ye&s;terday, I have deeply weighed your kind in&s;tructions, which has occa&s;ioned great unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s in my mind; and notwith&s;tanding I was &s;ome|what ea&s;y and compo&s;ed at certain periods before, I am, alas! quite otherwi&s;e now, for I am horribly afraid, my grievous &s;ins have been &s;et in array before me! and I am dreadfully intimidated and fearful, le&s;t God &s;hould never &s;hew me his mercy!" I told her, I was happier with this report, and much more &s;atisfied with her pre&s;ent &s;tate, than at my former vi&s;it, as I then perceived &s;ome hopes of her unhappy &s;tate, as her condition was, becau&s;e her con&s;cience was now convinced of her crime. I applied at this time many threatening, as well as healing, pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture to her con&s;cience, which &s;he very willingly, and with much thankfulne&s;s, received. I concluded this vi&s;it al&s;o with prayer, and then parted. Upon my third vi&s;it (which was on Monday) I found her in a very bad and dangerous &s;pirit: Here I exerted my every
<PB N="159" REF="162">
faculty, in order to &s;ettle her mind, and &s;trengthen her confidence in God; but, to my &s;orrowful di&s;ap|pointment, I ob&s;erved the enemy had &s;o buffetted her &s;oul, that &s;he &s;trongly endeavoured to conceal her guilt, telling me, with bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit, &s;he never intended murder; and that &s;he was a&s;&s;ured, the rigid, partial jury, who &s;at upon the body of the decea&s;ed, would, through their envonomed prejudice, treat her with a degree of rigour and &s;everity much heavier than her de&s;erts; this &s;he &s;pake with much warmth.</P>
<P>I then told her this perver&s;ene&s;s of &s;pirit, al&s;o her pre&s;ent temper and di&s;po&s;ition of mind, would prove exceedingly hurtful to her precious, never-dying &s;oul, and that it betrayed in her an ab&s;olute blindne&s;s and hard|ne&s;s of heart; &s;o that no &s;igns of repentance appeared, or the lea&s;t concern for &s;uch repeated acts of violence: I likewi&s;e gave her to under&s;tand, that I con&s;idered it a grand point of my duty to defend the characters of tho&s;e gentlemen who were on the coroner's inque&s;t; adding, "Can you (Mrs. Brownrigg) entertain a thought that tho&s;e gentlemen, who are under an oath, and in no wi&s;e intere&s;ted in giving fal&s;e evidence again&s;t you, would endeavour to take away your life, without &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons and good grounds in their evidence?" I in&s;i&s;ted upon her laying a&s;ide all &s;uch vain pretences, which were the mere artifices of the devil, to de&s;troy her &s;oul; telling her withal, if &s;he would &s;tand open to conviction, and behave in her
<PB N="160" REF="163">
&s;hort moments as became one who was thus confined to a few hours only for the working out her &s;alvation with fear and trembling, probably God would &s;hew her favour at the la&s;t, and the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which &s;peaketh better things than the blood of Abel, would wa&s;h away the &s;tain of that blood &s;he had &s;o cruelly and unre&s;trainedly &s;hed: I likewi&s;e pointed out to her, the loving &s;pirit of a dying Saviour, who, when he was expiring on the accur&s;ed tree for man's redemption, prayed with his la&s;t breath, &s;aying, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." His prayer was heard, and an&s;wered. When Peter was preaching to a great number of them, they were cut to the heart, and cried out, in an agony of &s;pirit, "Men and brethren, what mu&s;t we do to be &s;aved?" Peter an&s;wered them, "Repent every one of you, and be baptized in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, for the remi&s;&s;ion of your &s;ins, and <HI>you &s;hall</HI> receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t; for the promi&s;e is unto you, and to your children, and to all tho&s;e that are afar off, even to as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call:" Therefore," I ob&s;erved, "if the mercy of God extended it&s;elf to the very murderers of his only begotten Son, there can be no doubt that it will reach your poor guilty con&s;cience al&s;o! If you, like them, are pricked at the heart, and cry earne&s;tly to God for mercy through the Son of his Love, you likewi&s;e <HI>&s;hall</HI> obtain the remi&s;&s;ion of your &s;ins, and your name &s;hall be written in the Lamb's book of life. Then
<PB N="161" REF="164">
you &s;hall &s;ing the new &s;ong to God and the Lamb, who hath redeemed us with his blood, and &s;aves the vile&s;t and chief of &s;inners." The&s;e, with many &s;imi|lar exhortations, having been given her, &s;he began to recover her former compo&s;edne&s;s of &s;pirit, never more attempting to ju&s;tify her&s;elf, or even to extenu|ate her guilt. I terminated this vi&s;it with fervency of prayer al&s;o, and had not an opportunity of &s;eeing her again until the day prior to the awful day of her exit.</P>
<P>On the 13th of September, being the Lord's-Day, I came to Newgate about twelve o'clock, and met her as &s;he was coming down &s;tairs from the chapel. The keepers informed me of the &s;trict orders they had re|ceived to lock her up immediately in her cell, and de&s;ired me to be particularly vigilant in my remarks on her behaviour. Mrs. Brownrigg then went into her cell, and I followed her thereinto, and, at her reque&s;t, the turnkey and woman who attended her were both di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The cell doors were then locked and bolted upon us, when &s;he began to expre&s;s the extreme angui&s;h of her &s;oul, &s;aying, "Mr. Told, God for ever ble&s;s you, &s;it down by me." When we were &s;eated, &s;he began to wring her hands in vehement agitation of &s;pirit, praying mo&s;t earne&s;tly that God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, would have mercy upon her poor guilty &s;oul, expre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf, with floods of tears, to this effect, "O Lord Je&s;us! wa&s;h away the guilt of the blood
<PB N="162" REF="165">
which I have &s;hed, in thy mo&s;t precious blood! O Lord, I am the vile&s;t and chief of &s;inners; be gracious, be merciful to me, O heavenly Je&s;us, for none &s;uch a &s;inner as my&s;elf ever exi&s;ted! O &s;ave, &s;ave and deliver from eternal burnings, my poor, guilty, wretched, and hell-de&s;erving &s;oul! Oh! Lord, what mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved? Gracious God, what mu&s;t I do? Now, heavenly Je&s;us, clean&s;e thou my &s;tains, or I am undone for ever!" Thus &s;he continued for &s;ome minutes, and then turned to me, and &s;aid, "Mr. Told, what mu&s;t I do? My &s;oul is in bitterne&s;s and heavy di&s;tre&s;s." She added al&s;o, "I wre&s;tled all the la&s;t night with God in prayer, except the &s;pace of an hour, during which I &s;oundly &s;lept, and had very many comfortable vi&s;its from the Lord. During my interval of &s;leep I dreamed a dream, in which I beheld a man coming towards me with a gla&s;s of wine in his hand, who bade me drink it; I took particular notice of the wine that it was red, &s;o that when I awoke I was much re|fre&s;hed; but all my comforts are gone again, there|fore I am now more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed than ever."</P>
<P>I replied, "Mrs. Brownrigg, I am afraid you do not &s;ufficiently permit the &s;pirit of God to convince you of the enormity of the crime for which you are condemned. Are you condemned in your own con|&s;cience? Do you judge your&s;elf, that you may not be judged of God? Condemn your&s;elf, that you may not be condemned in the day of judgment, when the &s;ecrets of
<PB N="163" REF="166">
all hearts will be open to God, angels and men? Do you call to remembrance the &s;ins of your whole life? And are you fully convinced that you de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed eternally for your impiety and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion?" She replied, "I do." Then," &s;aid I, "if it be &s;o, you are not far from the kingdom of God." Wringing her hands, in an agony of &s;pirit, &s;he &s;aid, "Oh! that I may know this. Oh! that I may be a&s;&s;ured of this. Great God! enable me to depend on this." She continued to u&s;e &s;everal repetitions hereof. I then a&s;ked her whether &s;he was never tempted to de&s;troy her&s;elf. She an&s;wered, "Mr. Told, I am glad you have a&s;ked me this que&s;tion, and I will an&s;wer it without re&s;erve." Beginning the relation &s;he &s;aid, "When I was fir&s;t taken at Wand&s;worth, the con&s;ta|ble compelled my landlady to &s;earch my pockets, to know whether I had a knife, or any other in&s;trument, whereby I might have committed the &s;hocking act of &s;uicide. I was &s;earched accordingly, and although I had a knife &s;ecreted, yet it was not found. This threw me into a violent temptation, &s;o that I cut a little hole, about the bigne&s;s of a &s;ilver groat, in the peek of the&s;e my &s;tays," &s;hewing me the place. "Herein," continued &s;he, "I put the knife; it being a cla&s;ped one, I conveyed it round my hip through the covering of my &s;tays." She then pre&s;ented to me the very place where it lay undi&s;covered during her confinement in the Poultry compter. After that &s;he added, "Now, as I have advanced thus far, I

&s;hould be to blame were I to be &s;o very di&s;ingenuous as to conceal the re&s;t, therefore I &s;hall acknowledge to you, Mr. Told, that many times I u&s;ed to con&s;ider where, and on what part of my body it would be the mo&s;t expedient to &s;tab my&s;elf, that by &s;o doing I might effect the bu&s;ine&s;s at once; yet the Lord, in his infi|nite mercy, led me &s;afe through this temptation.</P>
<P>I then a&s;ked her if &s;he had ever &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered the con&s;equence of &s;o ra&s;h an attempt, and what would have become of her &s;oul if &s;he had died in an act of &s;elf-murder, &s;eeing it would be utterly impo&s;&s;ible for her to be &s;aved, not having time for repentance? She an&s;wered, "I never was inclined to think on, or con|&s;ider, any thing of that nature; for the con&s;ideration of that &s;hame, ignominy and reproach, that are al|ways con&s;equent on Tyburn executions, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed every other &s;erious and calm idea whereon my con|templations &s;hould have rationally dwelt." I told her I had a few que&s;tions more to a&s;k her, and beg'd &s;he would return me the plain, &s;imple truth, &s;o that her veracity might be un&s;ullied and &s;potle&s;s. She replied, "Mr. Told, I can open my heart to you, like as to my&s;elf; a&s;k what you judge proper, and I will, by openne&s;s and &s;implicity, endeavour to afford you &s;atisfaction." I then informed her, it was cur|rently reported, and well nigh in every one's mouth, that, in the cour&s;e of her practice in midwifry, &s;he had been guilty of de&s;troying &s;everal children in the
<PB N="165" REF="168">
birth, and feeding her &s;wine with them. I added, "Is this true, or not?" She replied, "I was a&s;ked the &s;ame que&s;tion &s;ome time ago by an eminent phy&s;i|cian; but truly, Mr. Told, I never had any misfortune during the time of my practice, except with three, and I now de&s;ire you to take down, in writing, the names of tho&s;e three gentlewomen I then laid, and they will give you a &s;atisfactory account, viz. whether the fault lay at my door or not, as they were all three brought into the world putrified. "I have had," &s;aid &s;he, "as good &s;ucce&s;s in general as mo&s;t women in my calling, and was equally e&s;teemed by my employers; neither were they ever &s;o wonderfully a&s;toni&s;hed as at the time this unfortunate affair came to light." The names of the three gentlewomen, who had the dead children, were Mrs Gore, at Camberwell; Mrs. Flude, at the workhou&s;e, in Grub-Street; and Mrs. &mdash;, at the Bell-Inn, Holborn.</P>
<P>The &s;econd que&s;tion I a&s;ked her, aro&s;e from an in|formation I had received touching her &s;ecret tran&s;acti|ons with &s;eventeen apprentice girls, whom &s;he had at &s;everal times acquired from various pari&s;hes in and about London, as it was &s;aid, that when &s;he was reque&s;ted to give an account of them, &s;he could produce but three. I demanded, "Is this true, or not?" To which &s;he an|&s;wered, "I never in my life had more than three ap|prentices, viz. the decea&s;ed, the evidence, and one that is gone back to the Foundling-Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="169">Thirdly, I a&s;ked her, if &s;he could &s;ay, in the pre&s;ence of Almighty God, that &s;he never practi&s;ed any of tho&s;e cruelties before. Her an&s;wer to this was, "I never did." I a&s;ked her again, what could induce her to commit &s;o dreadful an act of barbarity now. She &s;aid, "I can give you very &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons for &s;o doing." "Pray," &s;aid I, "what may they be?" She replied, "About ten years ago, when I had &s;ix &s;mall children about me, I walked clo&s;ely in the ways of God, never being able to accu&s;e my&s;elf of negligence, or inattention, ri&s;ing at five o'clock in the morning, and being at Bow Church-yard, in Cheap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le, at &s;ix o'clock prayers: Then, Mr. Told, I was very happy in my God, who manife&s;ted him&s;elf to me, &s;o that I walked &s;tedfa&s;tly in the light of his ble&s;&s;ed countenance for a con&s;iderable time: But, Oh! unhappily for me, I grew &s;lack in my duty, for&s;ook my God, and he for&s;ook me; &s;o that I fell into the &s;pirit of pride and anger, then, by degrees, into the crime for which I am to die! I can give you, Mr. Told, no other rea&s;on; but I beg you will help my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;oul all that you can." I replied, "I hum|bly hope God will be your helper, protector, and de|fender." As I &s;till hoped that &s;he had not committed the unpardonable &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, I tru&s;ted there was yet room for mercy; therefore I pre&s;&s;ed upon her to under&s;tand, that Chri&s;t him&s;elf declared, that every other &s;in, of what nature or kind &s;oever, &s;hall be forgiven unto men, upon tree repentance and deep
<PB N="167" REF="170">
humiliation, under a &s;en&s;e of guilt before God. Here I &s;trongly exhorted her to come to the throne of grace, and to tru&s;t fully in the blood of the everla&s;ting cove|nant; and that God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake would, upon no con&s;ideration, reject, or ca&s;t out tho&s;e who came to him through the Son of his Love; but would blot out all their iniquities as a cloud, and their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions as a thick cloud; and that God was in Chri&s;t recon|ciling the world unto him&s;elf. I al&s;o told her, that the Lord Je&s;us, even while he hung upon the accur&s;ed tree, bore all and every one of our &s;ins on his own body, &s;aying, "It is fini&s;hed," having made a full &s;ufficient &s;acrifice, oblation and &s;atisfaction, for the &s;ins of the whole world, and for her's, and mine in particular. I al&s;o beg'd her to ob&s;erve, that we were not damned &s;o much for particular or weighty crimes committed, but for not believing in our inmo&s;t &s;ouls the great truths of the Go&s;pel, which &s;peaks in this manner, "God &s;ent his Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Again, I informed her, that when the Lord Je&s;us &s;ent forth his twelve di&s;ciples, he gave them this com|mand, "Go ye into all the world, preach the Go&s;pel to every creature." "By the Go&s;pel you are to un|der&s;tand," &s;aid I, "the glad tidings of &s;alvation, through a crucified Redeemer; who&s;oever therefore believes, and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved, but he that
<PB N="168" REF="171">
believeth not &s;hall be damned." "My dear woman," added I, "venture your All in time and eternity on this great Saviour of the world, and then, though your &s;ins &s;hould be as &s;carlet, God will make them white as &s;now, and, although they be as crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as wool: You &s;ee then that God's thoughts towards us are not as our thoughts towards him and one another. See then that you lay fa&s;t hold on this hope of eternal life &s;et before you; and, though you will a&s;&s;uredly to|morrow, before this time, pay the debt of your natural life, for the life you have de&s;troyed; yet be of good com|fort, the Son of God hath given body for body, and &s;oul for &s;oul, that we may be made partakers of eternal life, and be for ever where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and the weary &s;pirits are at re&s;t." Thus I continued to pre&s;s the doctrines of &s;alvation by faith with weight upon her con&s;cience, and found my labour was not in vain in the Lord. She then began to be much com|forted, telling me before we parted, &s;he found &s;he could now tru&s;t body and &s;oul in the hands of her dear unerring Saviour. Her countenance was much altered, and that languid gloom, which re&s;ted upon her at our fir&s;t entrance into the cell, I ea&s;ily perceived to termi|nate in plea&s;ant &s;erenity. Compo&s;ure of mind, and re&s;ignation of &s;pirit, was expre&s;&s;ed &s;trongly in all her looks. I then went to prayer, and parted with her for this time, commending her into the hands of a merciful Redeemer.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="172">Monday the 14th in&s;tant, being the day of her exe|cution, I repaired to Newgate about a quarter pa&s;t &s;ix o'clock in the morning, where I found Mrs. Brownrigg with the Rev. Mr. Moor, the ordinary, in the pre&s;s|yard-room. We went immediately up to chapel, en|deavouring to comfort her in the be&s;t manner we could, and found her &s;pirit fully prepared to receive in&s;tructi|on, her mind greatly compo&s;ed, and her heart filled with prayer. When we came to chapel, we tarried &s;ome time before prayers began, in the cour&s;e of which interim the turnkey had introduced Mr. Brownrigg and their &s;on. They addre&s;&s;ed each other in a very &s;triking manner; then the ordinary prayed extempore with them, after which we &s;ang an hymn; he then exhorted, and prayed again; when he had done, he de&s;ired me to pray: I did &s;o, and we &s;ang another hymn, very applicable to the dying malefactors ca&s;e. Now when we were ready to communicate, the others were ad|mitted up to chapel, among whom were three clergy|men, who joined us in the &s;acred &s;upper of our Lord; and truly a ble&s;&s;ed time it was, e&s;pecially with the malefactor, her hu&s;band and &s;on; at the clo&s;e of which &s;olemnity, it was con&s;idered prudent to di&s;mi&s;s every per&s;on from the chapel, in order to give them the fairer opportunity of taking their la&s;t farewell of one another; &s;o we all retired accordingly, but I had not reached the bottom of the &s;teps before the keeper beckoned to me, &s;aying, Mrs. Brownrigg de&s;ired to &s;peak a few words with me. I &s;peedily returned to her; upon
<PB N="170" REF="173">
which &s;he &s;aid, "Mr. Told, we want you to employ a little more of your time with us; pray give my hu&s;band and &s;on a word of advice." I did &s;o, agreeable to her de&s;ires, and imparted (I may venture to &s;ay) no &s;mall &s;hare of in&s;truction, for which they all returned me many thanks. I then addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to Mrs. Brown|rigg, as &s;he was in the &s;pirit of prayer. While I was &s;peaking to her, the &s;on fell down on both his knees, and, bur&s;ting into a flood of tears, with his head again&s;t his mother's &s;ide, &s;aid, "I be&s;eech you, my dear mother, lay both your hands upon my head, and ble&s;s me." She replied, "I hope God will ble&s;s my dear &s;on." Almo&s;t frantic, he added, "My dear mother, put both your hands upon my head, and ble&s;s me your|&s;elf." His mother then put both her hands upon his head, &s;aying, "My ble&s;&s;ing be upon thee, my dear child." The hu&s;band then fell down on both his knees on the other &s;ide, &s;aying, "The Lord ble&s;s you; God be with you, my dear wife," being &s;carce able to &s;peak for weeping; he a&s;&s;ured her that all the care that was po&s;&s;ible &s;hould be taken of her offspring, that they might be trained up to &s;erve God. They then parted, when the keeper and my&s;elf led her down &s;tairs (as &s;he was, through extreme debility, unable to walk alone) and carried her into the pre&s;s-yard|room. The &s;heriff not having arrived, we caught another opportunity of being u&s;eful to her, applying our &s;hort time to the mo&s;t advantage. A clergyman, belonging to St. Paul's, was likewi&s;e of excellent &s;er|vice,
<PB N="171" REF="174">
giving her, without any narrowne&s;s of heart, good and whole&s;ome advice; the Lord reward him &s;even-fold in his own bo&s;om. The time came, when Mrs. Brownrigg was ordered into the cart, when the Rev. Mr James and my&s;elf &s;tationed our&s;elves by each &s;ide of her, Mr. James on the right-hand, and my&s;elf on the left. When we had fixed our&s;elves, I perceived the whole powers of darkne&s;s were ready to give her a reception. Beckoning to the multitude, I de&s;ired them to pray for her, at which they were rather &s;ilent, until the cart began to move. Then they triumphed over her with three huzzas; this was followed by a com|bination of helli&s;h cur&s;es. When we had pa&s;&s;ed thro' the gate, carts were placed on each &s;ide of the &s;treet, filled principally with women. Here I may &s;ay, with the greate&s;t truth, nothing could have equalled them, but the damned &s;pirits let loo&s;e from the infernal pit; and, to be brief, this was the &s;pirit of the wicked multitude intirely to the place of execution; and, not|with&s;tanding her crime was horrible, yet God, in his infinite wi&s;dom and mercy, &s;upported her mind; &s;ee|ing her time was &s;hort, &s;o that &s;he never made one complaint of &s;uch treatment; neither did &s;he drop one murmuring expre&s;&s;ion from her lips in any part of her pa&s;&s;age. I repeatedly a&s;ked her, if the dreadful tu|mult did not draw the attention of her mind from off the Lord Je&s;us. She replied, "Not in the lea&s;t, I ble&s;s God.' Then &s;ome of the common cries, from the thoughtle&s;s concour&s;e, accompanied with dreadful
<PB N="172" REF="175">
imprecations, were, pull her hat off, pull off her hat, that we may &s;ee the b&mdash;'s face: However, I with|&s;tood this cutting clamour all the way, till we came to the place of execution, and that for two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, I was con&s;cious it would too much expo&s;e her to the cen&s;ure of the inexorable mob, and, which was abundantly wor&s;e, it would di&s;compo&s;e her mind, and hinder her meditating with God; the &s;econd con&s;ide|ration was, that, as the incen&s;ed mob thought it not enough to rejoice over her by common rage and de|famatory abu&s;e, but were altogether cruel to ca&s;t &s;tones, dirt, &amp;c. therefore, if I, through endeavouring to pacify them by virtue of a friendly addre&s;s, &s;hould, on the contrary, excite their madne&s;s and exa&s;pera|tion, they would not only di&s;turb her mind, but en|danger her life before the law had executed its office. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here, I never, in the cour&s;e of my life, beheld &s;o much the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, which all mini&s;|ters of the Go&s;pel, of every denomination among&s;t us, lay under, in plucking tho&s;e brands out of the jaws of eternal death and de&s;truction, or a dreadful account will be one day given by &s;uch preachers. When we came to the place of execution, the outcries of the mob were not &s;o violent; yet, notwith&s;tanding, when &s;he was tied up to the fatal tree, and expo&s;ed to God, angels and men, (an awful &s;pectacle) little or no compa&s;&s;ion was drawn from the hearts of the populace, for the behaviour of thou&s;ands was &s;uch, as, I am per|&s;uaded, no part of the habitable world would be guilty
<PB N="173" REF="176">
of, except the inhabitants of Great-Britain. Imme|diately after the executioner had tied her up, I di&s;co|vered an horrible dread in her countenance: Fearing that &s;ome violent temptation had a&s;&s;aulted her, I beg'd to know the cau&s;e of her being &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. She &s;aid, "Mr. Told, I have many times pa&s;&s;ed by this place, and always experienced, when near this &s;pot of ground, a dreadful horror &s;eized me, for fear that one day or other I &s;hould come to be hanged. This," &s;aid &s;he, "enters afre&s;h upon my mind, and greatly terrifies me!" I &s;aid, "Your mind all the way was very compo&s;ed, and repeatedly you told me, you could put your full tru&s;t and confidence in your ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, and that you had no doubt but that you &s;hould be happy with him; don't you find it &s;o &s;till?" She replied, "I &s;till retain my confidence, but this power|fully occurs to my mind of what I frequently imagined whenever I pa&s;t this piece of ground, and therefore I am terrified exceedingly." I then told her, it was by no means a point of her bu&s;ine&s;s, or duty, to pay any attention to that; but her whole intire duty and attention was to look &s;tedfa&s;tly to the Lord Je&s;us, and that would be &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue every other oppo&s;i|tion, and enable her to re&s;ign her &s;pirit into the hands of Almighty God. Some time before &s;he was turned off, the Rev. Mr. Moor came into the cart, &s;pake to her, and prayed with her. We &s;ang two hymns, and continued to exhort her for three-quarters of an hour. She was very devout, crying vehemently for mercy.
<PB N="174" REF="177">
Ju&s;t as the cart was ready to draw off, the mini&s;ters all having gone out, I turned to her, and advi&s;ed her, in her la&s;t moment, to keep her mind &s;tedfa&s;tly fixed upon Chri&s;t. She &s;aid, "I hope I &s;hall." The cart then drew off, and, I humbly tru&s;t, God has received her departed &s;pirit. Amen.</P>
<P>Thus, Chri&s;tian Reader, concludes the narrative of the life of Mr. Silas Told, written by him&s;elf &s;ome time before his departure from this vale of tears, after having pa&s;&s;ed through a trouble&s;ome and laborious life with great fortitude and patience; being continually anxious for the good of his fellow creatures, particu|larly the condemned malefactors in the &s;everal pri&s;ons in and about the metropolis; &s;triving ardently, by all the means in his power, to promote their everla&s;ting welfare; &s;ubmitting meekly, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, to the ill treatment which he too often experienced, not only from pri&s;oners and keepers, &amp;c. but even to reproach and cen&s;ure from tho&s;e, who ought rather to have encouraged and applauded him. After having done all the good in his power, he chearfully re&s;igned his &s;oul into the hands of his Heavenly Father, in Decem|ber, 1779, in the 68th year of his age, and hath, no doubt, received this ble&s;&s;ed welcome, "Well done, good and faithful &s;ervant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."</P>
