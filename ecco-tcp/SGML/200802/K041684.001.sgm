<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Publi&s;her of the pre&s;ent Volumes has long ob&s;erved with &s;ur|prize the total neglect &s;hewn to the Works of Mr. GARRICK. Though &s;ix years are now elap&s;ed &s;ince his death, no one &s;tep has been taken towards giving an edition of them. Neither gratitude, friend&s;hip, affection, nor intere&s;t have in the &s;lighte&s;t manner interpo&s;ed. His pieces have been &s;uffered to remain in the &s;ame &s;tate in which the Author left them, a prey to time; &s;ubject to every accident; and, as it &s;hould &s;eem, doomed in a few years to be buried in oblivion.</P>
<P>The Author, carele&s;s and indifferent about his &s;maller productions, di&s;per&s;ed them in &s;uch a variety of publications,
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
that, had he been now living, he would probably have found &s;ome difficulty in a&s;&s;embling them together, or even, with|out a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to recollect them. This difficulty is encrea&s;ing every day. By the death of friends; by the forgetful|ne&s;s of contemporaries; and by the lo&s;s of fugitive pieces, a compleat collection of them (already a ta&s;k not ea&s;y to be accompli&s;hed) will in a few years be|come impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It is a con&s;ideration which may not be thought very honourable to human na|ture, that a man who contributed as much as any one of his time to the inno|cent amu&s;ement of life; who&s;e perform|ances on the &s;tage mu&s;t be always remem|bered with delight by tho&s;e who had the happine&s;s of &s;eeing them; who had both the inclination and ability to confer fa|vours; who le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t behind him many living memorials of his friend&s;hip and genero|&s;ity; and who&s;e death, as has been truly

&s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"eclip&s;ed the gaiety of nations, and impoveri&s;hed the publick &s;tock of innocent plea&s;ure,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on's Life of Edmund Smith.</NOTE></Q> &s;hould hitherto have found no per&s;on attentive to the calls of re&s;pect, no one alive to the re|mon&s;trances of gratitude, to erect a mo|nument to his fame, by collecting and publi&s;hing his fugitive performances.</P>
<P>Abandoned and neglected as the&s;e have been, both by their Author and his Repre&s;entatives, the Publi&s;her has been prevailed upon to &s;ollicit the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of many of Mr. Garrick's friends, and by their aid he has been enabled to pre&s;ent to the Publick a collection which has been long enquired after, and which, from the care with which it has been formed, he tru&s;ts will not di&s;grace the memory of the Author. Should the &s;ources from whence the &s;everal pieces have been drawn be enumerated, he is certain that he &s;hould be allowed &s;ome
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
merit from his indu&s;try, as almo&s;t every performance has been &s;elected from a different publication, mo&s;t of them very difficult to be procured, and &s;ome, from their &s;carcity, equal in value to manu|&s;cripts.</P>
<P>It would be impertinent to take up the Reader's time in recommending what has been &s;o long and &s;o univer&s;ally ap|proved. Mr. Garrick's writings do not want any &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Their merit has been already fully acknowledged, and require only to be more diffu&s;ed, to be more applauded. They are here cla&s;&s;ed in &s;ome mea&s;ure according to their &s;ubjects, and for the mo&s;t part in chronological order. By this means the Prologues and Epilogues, which gene|rally turn on the fa&s;hions or incidents of the day, will &s;erve to illu&s;trate and keep in memory the foibles, virtues, vices and habits of the times, and exhibit no un|faithful picture of the good &s;en&s;e or folly
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
which has prevailed heretofore, compared with the pre&s;ent or any future period.</P>
<P>To render the pre&s;ent edition as com|pleat as po&s;&s;ible, the Publi&s;her has added a &s;hort Account of Mr. Garrick's Life and Writings; together with two Li&s;ts, one of his Dramatick Works, and the other of the characters he performed. Both the&s;e he is informed are compiled with accuracy, and will be allowed to have their u&s;e. To them he has &s;ub|joined Mr. Sheridan's elegant Monody; a compo&s;ition which is entitled to equal prai&s;e in the clo&s;et that it was honoured with on the Theatre. To conclude: he feels &s;ome &s;atisfaction in reflecting, that through his endeavours the Works and literary fame of Mr. Garrick will be re|deemed from that fate into which a few years more would have involved &s;o excel|lent a writer and &s;o valuable a man.</P>

<HEAD>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF DAVID GARRICK, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB N="xi" REF="10">A SHORT ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>DAVID GARRICK was born at Here|ford, about the month of February, 1716. His grandfather was a merchant of French ex|traction, as it is &s;aid, who left his native country on the revocation of the edict of Nantz in the year 1685. This gentleman had two &s;ons and two daughters: one of the former became a wine-merchant at Li&s;bon; and the other, who&s;e name was Peter, the father of the late Mr. Garrick, followed the military profe&s;&s;ion, and had at the time of his death been advanced to a majority in the army. He mar|ried a daughter of Mr. Clough, one of the Vicars in Litchfield Cathedral, and happened to be quartered at the Angel-inn in Hereford, where his &s;on David (who was baptized<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following is an extract from the regi&s;ter book of the pari&s;h of All Saints in the City of Hereford: <Q REND="inline">"David Gar|rick, the &s;on of Peter and Arabella Garrick, was baptized the 28th of February, 1716."</Q></P>
<P>It is remarkable, that the late Mr. Powell was al&s;o born in the city of Hereford.</P></NOTE> the
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
28th of February 1716) was born. Mr. Gar|rick, the father, afterwards &s;ettled at Litchfield, and re&s;ided there &s;everal years. A &s;hort time before his death he determined to &s;ell his com|mi&s;&s;ion, and for that purpo&s;e entered into a treaty with a gentleman who had agreed to give him 1100l. for it; but, unfortunately, before the &s;ale was completed he died, and left a numerous family in a great mea&s;ure unprovided for.</P>
<P>His &s;on David received the fir&s;t part of his education at the free &s;chool of Litchfield under Mr. Hunter, who had the honour of number|ing among&s;t his &s;cholars, Doctor John&s;on, Chief Ju&s;tice Willes, Doctor Newton, Bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, and other men of eminence. Very early in life our Ro&s;cius found a friend in Gil|bert Walm&s;ley, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> regi&s;ter of the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical court there; a gentleman then unmar|ried and well advanced in years, who&s;e partia|lity &s;eemed to authori&s;e &s;ome favourable expec|tations of a permanent provi&s;ion; all which were de&s;troyed by Mr. Walm&s;ley's unexpect|edly taking a wife. He, however, recom|mended his young friend to Mr. Col&s;on, ma&s;ter of the academy at Roche&s;ter, in order to com|pleat his education; and accordingly, in the month of March, 1736, Mr. Garrick left

Litchfield, in company with Doctor Samuel John&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A character of Mr. Walm&s;ley (who died Augu&s;t 3, 1751, aged 69) is given by Doctor John&s;on, n his elegant life of Ed|mund Smith, which accompanies "The works of the Engli&s;h Poets." The following epitaph was written on him by Mr. Seward.<Q><LG TYPE="epitaph">

</LG>
</LG></Q></P>

<P>Mr. Walm&s;ley tran&s;lated into Latin&mdash;Doctor Byrom's cele|brated &s;ong, beginning <Q REND="inline">"My time, Oye mu&s;es,"</Q> &amp;c. It is in the <HI>Gentleman's Magazine,</HI> February 1745.</P></NOTE>, who at the &s;ame time quitted his profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;choolma&s;ter, and came to Lon|don, where he afterwards became one of the fir&s;t ornaments of literature.</P>
<P>At the age of about eleven years, Mr. Gar|rick went over to Li&s;bon, and was received by his uncle with great kindne&s;s; but, that &s;trict|ne&s;s of morals which a fond relation wi&s;hed to
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
&s;ee in his nephew not being ob&s;erved at that place, to prevent his being corrupted, it was thought proper to &s;end him back to England; his uncle &s;till pre&s;erving a great regard for him, which he &s;hewed at his death by leaving him a legacy of 1000l.</P>
<P>It appears from Mr. <HI>Walm&s;ley's</HI> letters, that Mr. Garrick was intended for the profe&s;&s;ion of the law; and accordingly, on the 9th day of March 1736<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Play-hou&s;e Dictionary.</NOTE>, immediately on his arrival in London, he was entered of the &s;ociety of Lincoln's-Inn; but it is certain he never paid any attention to the &s;tudy of that &s;cience; and indeed it is within the memory of many yet liv|ing, that his employment for a &s;hort time, in the interval between his leaving &s;chool and his appearance on the &s;tage, was of a nature very different from what he was fir&s;t de&s;tined to, and what he afterwards pur&s;ued with &s;o much repu|tation and &s;ucce&s;s. We are credibly informed that he followed the bu&s;ine&s;s of a wine-mer|chant &s;omewhere in or near Durham-yard, be|ing induced thereto, it may be pre&s;umed, by the encouragement and &s;upport of his uncle.</P>
<P>To whatever cau&s;e it was owing, we are not informed; but his &s;ucce&s;s in bu&s;ine&s;s was not &s;ufficient to engage his continuance in it; and
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
this want of &s;ucce&s;s might perhaps ari&s;e from his attention to a more plea&s;ing pur&s;uit. He had at &s;chool performed the part of Serjeant Kite with applau&s;e; and he was now prompted to employ the talents which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for his immediate &s;upport. Chetwood mentions, that his facetious good humour gained him entrance behind the &s;cenes two or three years in Drury-lane, before he commenced actor, and it is certain that he produced there, his fir&s;t drama called Lethe, in April, 1740, for Mr. Giffard's Benefit. Determining to try his for|tune on the &s;tage, he went down to <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> under the name of Lyddel, and performed in a &s;trolling company there. The part in which he fir&s;t appeared was that of Aboan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the information of a contemporary comedian.</NOTE> in Oroo|noko; and the approbation he met with in this country excur&s;ion encouraged him to pur&s;ue his plan in London. He, therefore, after being (as it is reported) rejected by the manager of Covent Garden, to whom he had offered his &s;ervice, engaged with Mr. Giffard, at the theatre in Goodman's Fields, in the year 1741. The character he then attempted was that of Richard the Third; and he performed it Octo|ber 19th, 1741, in a manner which fixed his re|putation
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
on that ba&s;is upon which it &s;tood, as the fir&s;t actor of the times, during the re&s;t of his life. Two circum&s;tances were ob&s;erved on his fir&s;t night's performance; one, that, on his entrance on the &s;tage, he was under &s;o much embarra&s;&s;ment, that for &s;ome time he was un|able to &s;peak: the other, that, having exerted him&s;elf with much vehemence in the fir&s;t two acts, he became &s;o hoar&s;e as to be almo&s;t inca|pable of fini&s;hing the character. This diffi|culty was obviated by a per&s;on behind the &s;cenes recommending him to take the juice of a Seville orange, which he fortunately had in his pocket, and which enabled him to go through the re|mainder of the character with that degree of excellence which he always afterwards &s;hewed in the performance of it, and which produced the applau&s;e which ever after uniformly at|tended him in it. The per&s;on to whom he owed this &s;ea&s;onable relief was the late Mr. Dryden Leach, printer, who u&s;ed often to tell the &s;tory to his friends.</P>
<P>It was during this fir&s;t year of his theatrical life that he produced the farce of <HI>The Lying Valet;</HI> a performance which has given plea|&s;ure to numberle&s;s &s;pectators, even after the principal character cea&s;ed to be performed by
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">
its author. At the end of the &s;ea&s;on he went over to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in that kingdom added both to his fortune and his fame. The next year (1742 to 1743) he performed at Drury Lane, and the year after (1743 to 1744) at the &s;ame theatre. At the beginning of this &s;ea&s;on he was involved in a di&s;pute with Mr. Macklin, who had joined with him in oppo&s;ing the op|pre&s;&s;ions of the managers. That gentleman complained that he was de&s;erted in the agree|ment made with the managers, and publi&s;hed a &s;tate of his ca&s;e, in a pamphlet, intituled, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. Macklin's reply to Mr. Garrick's an|&s;wer. To which are prefixed, all the pa|pers which have publickly appeared in regard to this important di&s;pute."</Q> The next year (1744 to 1745) he continued at Drury Lane; but the &s;ucceeding &s;ea&s;on (1745 to 1746) he went again to Dublin, and engaged with Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> as joint &s;harer and adventurer in the theatre there. In May 1746, he returned to London, and performed in &s;ix plays at the end of that month at Covent Garden, by which, we are told, he added 300l. to a great &s;um ac|quired in Ireland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Victor's Hi&s;tory of the Theatres, vol. I. p. 89.</NOTE>. He performed but one year more as an hired actor (1746 to 1747) which was at Covent Garden theatre, where he pro|duced <HI>Mi&s;s in her Teens.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="17">
The mi&s;management of the patentees of Drury-lane Theatre, after the deaths of Booth and Wilks, and the retirement of Cibber from the &s;tage, had ruined every per&s;on concerned in it. At this period the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Mr. Fleet|wood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles Fleetwood, E&s;q. The hi&s;tory of this gentleman is very remarkable. It affords &s;o &s;triking a moral, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;o important a le&s;&s;on, that, though not &s;trictly con|nected with the life of Mr. Garrick, we hope to be pardoned for in&s;erting the following particulars concerning him. At the age of twenty-one he came to a landed e&s;tate of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds a year. <Q REND="inline">"He was,"</Q> &s;ays Mr. Victor, Hi&s;tory of the Theatres, Vol. I. p. 33, <Q REND="inline">"agreeable in his per&s;on; and the qualities of his mind and amiablene&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition carried with them irre&s;i&s;tible attractions; all the nobility of the kingdom &s;eemed fond of cultivating an acquaintance with a young man of his ex|ten&s;ive fortune, right di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;weetne&s;s of temper. He was affable and engaging in his addre&s;s, which was the la&s;t and only remaining quality that he kept with him to his death; and, no doubt, that would have vani&s;hed with the re&s;t, if he had not found it of con&s;tant u&s;e to him in his bu&s;ine&s;s with the world, as that addre&s;s enabled him to deceive even per&s;ons that thought them&s;elves armed again&s;t him."</Q> He purcha&s;ed the patent of Drury-lane Theatre in the year 1734, and continued in the management of it until 1745, when he left the kingdom; and &s;ome time after died a bankrupt both in fortune and reputation. Mr. Victor &s;ays, he was a ruined man before he engaged in theatrical concerns, and that for &s;ome years he profited by his purcha&s;e. It was his misfortune early in life to be thwarted in a de&s;ign which he entertained, of uniting him&s;elf to a young lady of inferior fortune; the di&s;appointment of which threw him into that habit of di&s;&s;ipation, which rendered him an ea&s;y prey to a &s;et of &s;harpers, who fir&s;t deprived him of his fortune, and afterwards of his integrity. The pre&s;ent Duke of Norfolk, in his <HI>Thoughts, E&s;&s;ays,</HI> and <HI>Maxims,</HI> publi&s;hed in 12mo. 1768, p. 87, relates the following fact, which <Q REND="inline">"happened in the pre&s;ence of his wife, at either Bruges or Ghent, before he was married, or at all acquainted with her; viz. Mrs. Fleet|wood, daughter to Lord Gerrard, and mother to Mr. Fleetwood, who was ma&s;ter manager of Drury-lane Playhou&s;e (a gentle|man of a very ancient good family, unhappily known) came upon a vi&s;it, and flung her&s;elf upon her knees to a&s;k pardon of a Baronet's daughter, who was then companion to Mrs. How|ard, as the only atonement left in her power for having pre|vented her only &s;on from marrying her, to whom there could be no objection, but that her fortune was not as great as ano|ther lady's &s;he had in view for him; by which means &s;he was the occa&s;ion, indirectly, of the unhappine&s;s of the young lady, by unhinging her mind, and &s;ouring her temper; and of her only &s;on's rum, both in fortune and reputation, by flinging him into a round of di&s;&s;ipation and plea&s;ure in order to eradicate his &s;tronge&s;t affections. This kind of life had &s;uch an effect on him, that he contracted that baneful habit of gaming; &s;o that in the cour&s;e of a few years he ruined his fortune, (a very noble one) as mo&s;t game&s;ters do, fir&s;t by &s;etting out a dupe, and afterwards turning &s;harper: at length he died unpitied, and, it is &s;aid, of a broken heart, being a little before reduced to a wretched annuity in &s;ome part of France."</Q> He left &s;everal children. Two of them appeared on the &s;tage as actors, and one is but lately dead. This gentleman was two &s;ea&s;ons, 1758 and 1759, at Drury-lane Theatre, and received a con&s;iderable &s;hare of applau&s;e. He however afterwards declined the pur|&s;uit, and went to the Ea&s;t Indies, where he acquired a genteel fortune. The other &s;on died at Edinburgh a few years &s;ince.</NOTE> became involved in &s;o many difficul|ties,

that it was no longer po&s;&s;ible for them to
<PB N="xx" REF="19">
continue the conduct of a bu&s;ine&s;s to which they were &s;trangers, and which they were never likely to &s;ucceed in. In 1745 that gentleman had left the Theatre to his creditors to manage, after making the be&s;t terms he was able for him|&s;elf. They conducted the bu&s;ine&s;s of it for two &s;ea&s;ons, when, unable to continue the ma|nagement any longer, the property of the pa|tent, hou&s;e, and &s;cenes, was offered to &s;everal per&s;ons: but &s;o apprehen&s;ive was every on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> become of the hazard of intermeddling with the theatre, that no purcha&s;er was for &s;ome time to be found. At this juncture the late Mr. Lacy &s;tepped forward, and boldly ventured to engage for the purcha&s;e. Having the reputa|tion of a man of integrity, he &s;oon found friends among the monied men to &s;upport him in his undertaking; the &s;ucce&s;s of it, he prudently concluded, mu&s;t depend in &s;ome mea&s;ure on the abilities of the per&s;on with whom he &s;hould connect him&s;elf in the &s;cheme. Mr. Garrick's reputation, both as a man and an actor, na|turally led him to wi&s;h for his junction. A treaty was &s;oon begun, and an agreement be|tween them afterwards took place. Appli|cation was made for a new patent; which was obtained, and both their names in&s;erted in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Victor's Hi&s;tory of the Theatres, Vol. I. p. 84.</NOTE>.
<PB N="xxi" REF="20">
The &s;ea&s;on which began in 1747 was the fir&s;t of their management, and was opened with an admirable Prologue, written by Doctor John|&s;on, and &s;poken by Mr. Garrick<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Doctor John&s;on's Poems, publi&s;hed by Kear&s;ley.</NOTE>. From this time Drury Lane Theatre, which had been &s;o fatal to many adventurers, became the &s;ource of wealth and independence to both partners, who jointly exerted their &s;everal abilities in the management of the undertaking, with a de|gree of harmony which did credit to their un|der&s;tandings, and with a &s;hare of &s;ucce&s;s which in &s;ome mea&s;ure mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to that good corre&s;pondence which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Lacey's memory, as an hone&s;t and worthy man, to who&s;e a&s;&s;iduity and attention we are partly indebted for the pre|&s;ent regularity of the Theatre, de&s;erves a few words. He was originally a manufacturer at Norwich, but un&s;ucce&s;sful in his connexions with trade. He afterwards came on the &s;tage, and performed at the Hay-market in <HI>Pa&s;quin</HI> and other pieces which were brought out at that theatre when under the direction of the late Henry Fielding, e&s;q. He then read lectures in York Buildings, and engaged in the &s;cheme of building Ranelagh, which the knavery of the per&s;on with whom he a&s;&s;ociated ren|dered un&s;ucce&s;sful. The confidence which was repo&s;ed in his integrity enabled him without money to become the purcha&s;er of Drury Lane Theatre at the juncture above-mentioned; and his prudence was the means of his ama&s;&s;ing a con&s;iderable for|tune, which however would have been much larger, had not an unhappy propen&s;ity to &s;cheming taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him, and induced him to launch into undertakings by which he was a great lo&s;er. We are informed his property was much le&s;&s;ened by &s;earching for coal-mines in Oxford&s;hire. He was however &s;till rich; and, at his death, January 1774, left a very hand|&s;ome e&s;tate to an only &s;on, whom he had by Mrs. Willoughby, an actre&s;s of Drury Lane Theatre. This Gentleman has &s;ince &s;old his &s;hare in the theatre.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="21">
After he had been a manager two years, and the di&s;&s;ipation of youth had &s;ub&s;ided, the charms of a lady, who then lived with the counte&s;s of Barlington as a companion, made a conque&s;t of him. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to add that this lady is at pre&s;ent his widow. She is, we are informed, by birth a German. Her parents lived at Vi|enna; and &s;he appeared on the &s;tage there as a dancer. In the year 1746, &s;he came to En|gland, and performed one Sea&s;on at Drury Lane Theatre. She was then called Madame Eva Maria Violetti. The union between them took place on the 22d day of June, 1749; and we may add, that no marriage ever was attend|ed with more happine&s;s to both parties than this for near thirty years, during which time, it is on good authority a&s;&s;erted, they &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed a day &s;eparate from each other.</P>
<P>The theatrical &s;ea&s;on which commenced in the year 1750 was rendered remarkable by the
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22">
&s;pirit of rival&s;hip which prevailed at both hou&s;es. At the beginning of Mr. Garrick's manage|ment he had engaged Barry, Macklin, Pritchard, Woffington, Cibber, and Clive; and, with the&s;e excellent performers, it may be imagined the profits of the Hou&s;e were very con&s;iderable. Soon after, Mr. Barry, who was under articles, refu&s;ed to continue any longer at Drury Lane, and, when &s;ued for the breach of his contract e&s;caped from the penalty by means no way re|dounding to his honour. Macklin and Mrs. Cibber likewi&s;e went over to Covent Garden; as did Mrs. Woffington, who is &s;aid to have entertained expectations of being united in mar|riage with Mr. Garrick. With the&s;e de&s;erters, aided by the veteran Quin, Mr. Rich opened Covent Garden Theatre. Mr. Garrick, not intimidated by the &s;trength of the oppo&s;ition, took the field on the 5th of September with an occa&s;ional Prologue &s;poken by him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 102.</NOTE>; which was an&s;wered by another delivered by Mr. Barry; and this again replied to by a very hu|mourous Epilogue, admirably repeated by Mrs. Clive<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See p. 104.</NOTE>. The play of Romeo and Juliet had lain dormant many years. This was now re|vived at both Hou&s;es: at Drury Lane, with al|terations
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23">
by Mr. Garrick, who performed the principal character; Mr. Woodward playing Mercutio; and Mrs. Bellamy, Juliet: again&s;t them at Covent-garden, were Mr. Barry and Mrs. Cibber in the principal characters, and Mr. Macklin in Mercutio. Both hou&s;es began on the fir&s;t of October; and continued to per|form it for twelve &s;ucce&s;&s;ive nights; when Covent-garden gave up the contention; and its rival kept the field one night more, with the credit of holding out longer than its oppo|nent, though it is &s;uppo&s;ed neither &s;ide reaped much advantage from the &s;pirit of per&s;everance which had governed them both in this conte&s;t.</P>
<P>In the year 1754, on the 6th day of March, died Mr. Pelham, who had conducted the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of government for &s;ome years before with candour, ability, and integrity. He was &s;in|cerely lamented both by prince and people; and on this occa&s;ion Mr. Garrick di&s;played his poetic talents, in an ode which we are told ran through four editions in a few weeks. It is a performance which does credit to him, both as a man and a poet, and is the fir&s;t in the pre&s;ent volumes.</P>
<P>The objectors to Mr. Garrick's manage|ment of the theatre had a long time complained
<PB N="xxv" REF="24">
that he had conducted him&s;elf with too &s;trict an attention to oeconomy in the ornamental and decorative parts of theatrical exhibitions. They were perpetually throwing out in&s;inua|tions, that the manager, relying on his own powers, was determined to regulate the enter|tainments of the &s;tage with an eye only to his own advantage, and without any regard to the &s;atisfaction of the public. The&s;e murmurs had continued &s;ome time, when at la&s;t Mr. Garrick determined to meet the wi&s;hes of his friends, and to &s;ilence the di&s;contents of his enemies. For this purpo&s;e he applied to Mr. Denoyer, &s;en. to recommend &s;ome per&s;on of genius to &s;uperintend and contrive a &s;plendid &s;pectacle to be exhibited at Drury-lane. The per&s;on fixed upon for the purpo&s;e was Mr. Noverre, a Swi&s;s; who immediately received orders to engage the be&s;t troop of dancers that could be procured. The&s;e he &s;elected from the foreign theatres; and they con&s;i&s;ted of Swi&s;s, Italians, Germans, and &s;ome French. The entertainment in which they were employed was &s;oon afterwards produced. It was called The Chine&s;e Fe&s;tival; and was, in the thea|trical phra&s;e, got up with great magnificence, and at a very con&s;iderable expence. The ex|pectations
<PB N="xxvi" REF="25">
of the managers were however wholly di&s;appointed in the &s;ucce&s;s of the per|formance. Although but few of the French nation were employed in it, yet a report had been indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread, that not only French dancers had been &s;ent for over, but French dre&s;&s;es al&s;o, and even French carpenters and taylors. The nation was then on the eve of a war; and this afforded an opportunity for en|gaging the pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves Antigallicans. They accordingly formed a&s;&s;ociations, to di&s;courage the &s;everal performers, and &s;uppre&s;s the obnoxious per|formance whenever it &s;hould appear. At length, after having taken up more than eighteen months in preparing, it was brought before the publick, and received with all the virulence and oppo&s;ition which might be expected from the violence and heat of the times. The fir&s;t performance of it was on the 8th day of No|vember, 1755, and was honoured with the pre|&s;ence of his late Maje&s;ty; yet, notwith&s;tand|ing that circum&s;tance, it did not even then e&s;cape ill treatment. On the &s;econd, third, fourth, and fifth nights, the riots continued with increa&s;ing &s;trength, though oppo&s;ed each evening by &s;everal young men of fa&s;hion, who
<PB N="xxvii" REF="26">
had determined to &s;upport the performance. On the &s;ixth evening the oppo&s;ition acquired fre&s;h vigour and increa&s;ing numbers. They fru&s;trated every attempt to proceed in the ex|hibition; and committed every exce&s;s which a mob, &s;ubject to no controul, is apt to indulge it&s;elf in. That evening was the la&s;t repre&s;en|tation. After receiving a&s;&s;urance that the piece &s;hould be acted no more, the heroes who had &s;ignalized them&s;elves in this important bu|&s;ine&s;s proceeded to Mr. Garrick's hou&s;e in Southampton-&s;treet, where they broke his windows, and did other damages. They then di&s;per&s;ed; and the proprietors of the theatre were obliged to &s;ubmit to the lo&s;s of more than four thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate the &s;e|veral &s;mall pieces of poetry which Mr. Garrick u&s;ed to throw out from time to time, as his lei|&s;ure permitted, to compliment his friends, or to celebrate public events. We &s;hall, however, ju&s;t mention here that in 1755 he wrote &s;ome ver&s;es on Mr. Ma&s;on's taking orders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 504</NOTE>; and in 1757 he appears to have been one of the few who had ta&s;te enough to reli&s;h the beauties of Mr. Gray's celebrated odes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ma&s;on's Life of Gray, p. 250.</NOTE>. In 1759 Dr. Hill
<PB N="xxviii" REF="27">
wrote a pamphlet, intituled, "To David Gar|rick, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the Petition of <HI>I,</HI> in behalf of her|&s;elf and her &s;i&s;ters." The purport of it was to charge Mr. Garrick with mi&s;pronouncing &s;ome words including the letter I, as <HI>furm</HI> for firm, <HI>vurtue</HI> for virtue, and others. The pam|phlet is now forgotten; but the Epigram, which Mr. Garrick wrote on the occa&s;ion, de&s;erves to be pre&s;erved, as one of the be&s;t in the En|gli&s;h language.</P>
<P>From this period no event of importance oc|curs in the annals of Mr. Garrick's life until the year 1761. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the theatre went on without interruption; and he conti|nued to acquire both reputation and fortune. In that year, however, he found him&s;elf obliged to exert his poetical talents, in order to correct the impertinence of an in&s;ignificant individual, a Mr. Fitzpatrick, who, without provocation, and in defiance of decency, carried on a weekly attack again&s;t him, in a paper called "The Craft&s;man." The original cau&s;e of the quar|rel, we are informed, was grounded on &s;ome illiberal reflexions which Mr. Fitzpatrick threw out again&s;t Mr. Garrick, and which the latter re&s;ented with &s;pirit and propriety, though a con&s;iderable time had elap&s;ed before he was
<PB N="xxix" REF="28">
provoked to take public notice of him. As Mr. Fitzpatrick's writings are now entirely forgotten, the revenge which Mr. Garrick took of him mu&s;t, from that circum&s;tance alone, be involved in &s;ome ob&s;curity. Tho&s;e, however, who are unacquainted with either per&s;ons or facts will receive plea&s;ure in reading Mr. Gar|rick's admirable &s;atire publi&s;hed on this occa|&s;ion, intituled THE FRIBBLERIAD, a Poem, which had the honour of being highly com|mended by Churchill, who has al&s;o given a very &s;evere correction to the &s;ame per&s;on.</P>
<P>However unequal Mr. Fitzpatrick was to the ta&s;k of contending with Mr. Garrick in a literary warfare, yet the rancour which his de|feat had engendered pointed out a new mode of attack to di&s;tre&s;s his antagoni&s;t. It had been cu&s;tomary, on the repre&s;entation of a new per|formance, to refu&s;e admittance at any part of the evening, unle&s;s the whole price of the en|tertainment was paid. This had almo&s;t invari|ably been the rule; and it had hitherto been &s;ub|mitted to, as a rea&s;onable demand from the managers, to compen&s;ate for the extraordinary expence which new dre&s;&s;es and &s;cenes occa&s;i|oned. To gratify his re&s;entment, Mr. Fitz|patrick &s;eized on this circum&s;tance as a ground to di&s;turb the peace of the theatre, and to in|volve
<PB N="xxx" REF="29">
the managers in a conte&s;t with the pub|lick. For this purpo&s;e hand-bills were di&s;per&s;ed about the coffee hou&s;es in the neighbourhood of Drury-lane, recommending a peremptory de|mand to be made, and requiring an ab&s;olute promi&s;e to be given that no more than half the u&s;ual price &s;hould be taken on any evening of performance after the third act, unle&s;s at the repre&s;entation of a new pantomime. A kind of a&s;&s;ociation was entered into by &s;everal young men, to obtain a redre&s;s of this grievance, as it was called; and Mr. Fitzpatrick put him&s;elf at the head of it. The evening on which the attack was made happened to be when the <HI>The two Gentlemen of Verona</HI> was performed for the alterer's Benefit. The performance accord|ingly was interrupted, after &s;everal attempts to proceed in it; and the proprietors of the hou&s;e, thinking the requi&s;ition an unju&s;t one, and the manner of making it improper to be acceded to, refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to it: in con&s;equence whereof no play was acted that night, and the audience received their money again at the doors, having fir&s;t amu&s;ed them&s;elves with do|ing all the mi&s;chief they were able. By this trial, the malecontents had di&s;covered their &s;trength, and determined to carry their point
<PB N="xxxi" REF="30">
in humbling the pride of the manager. On the next performance, which was at the tragedy of <HI>Elvira,</HI> they collected their whole force, and again prevented the actors proceeding in the play. It was in vain that Mr. Garrick de&s;ired to be heard in defence of the ancient cu&s;toms of the theatre. The oppo&s;ition in&s;i&s;ted on a peremptory an&s;wer to their demand in the new regulation; which, after &s;ome time, the pro|prietors of the hou&s;e were obliged to agree to; and once more peace was re&s;tored to the thea|tre after a con&s;iderable lo&s;s had been &s;u&s;tained, and obliged to be &s;ubmitted to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of this riot, <HI>Gentleman's Magazine</HI> vol. XXIII. p. 31.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This &s;ea&s;on was the la&s;t in which Mr. Gar|rick could be &s;aid to have acted in the regular cour&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion. From this time he de|clined performing any new characters; and, finding his health un&s;ettled by the advice of his phy&s;ician he determined to give him&s;elf &s;ome relaxation from care and fatigue. He there|fore made the arrangements nece&s;&s;ary for carry|ing on the public entertainments during his ab|&s;ence; and on the 15th of September 1763, the day on which the Hou&s;e opened, he left London, in order to make the tour of France, and Italy. To &s;upply his place, he engaged
<PB N="xxxii" REF="31">
the late Mr. Powell, who had received his in|&s;tructions the preceding &s;ummer, and who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s was equal to the abilities he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. To the honour of his employers, it may be added, that his abilities were not higher than the encouragement he received for the exertion of them. Although he was engaged for a term of years at a &s;mall &s;alary; yet he was, before the &s;ea&s;on clo&s;ed, generou&s;ly allowed an ap|pointment equal to the fir&s;t performer in the hou&s;e. We are credibly informed, the pro|&s;its that year exceeded even tho&s;e in which Mr. Garrick performed in the height of his repu|tation.</P>
<P>The interval from this period, until the month of April 1765, Mr. Garrick employed in travelling through the principal parts of Eu|rope; and was, at every place where he re&s;i|ded, and at mo&s;t of the courts to which he was introduced, received in the mo&s;t honoura|ble and cordial manner; by the great, as well as by men of letters; each vying with the other in &s;hewing re&s;pect to the greate&s;t drama|tic character of the age. While he &s;tayed at Paris, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with reading <HI>Fon|taine's Fables;</HI> which plea&s;ed him &s;o much, that he was induced to attempt an imitation of
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="32">
them. He accordingly wrote one, called <HI>The Sick Monkey;</HI> which he tran&s;mitted over to a friend, to be ready for publication immediately on his arrival. It accordingly made its ap|pearance in two or three days after, with the following motto: <Q REND="inline">"Thur&s;day afternoon Da|vid Garrick, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> arrived at his hou&s;e in Southampton-&s;treet, Covent-garden. Public Adverti&s;er, April 27, 1765."</Q> And he had the plea&s;ure of hearing the &s;entiments of his friends upon it; many of whom mi&s;took it for a &s;atire upon him, and accordingly expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in very warm terms on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Immediately on his arrival he re&s;umed the management of the theatre, and introduced &s;ome improvements which had been &s;ugge&s;ted by his ob&s;ervations on the conduct of the fo|reign &s;tages. From the li&s;t of his works it will be &s;een that he had not been idle while abroad. He produced the next &s;ea&s;on &s;everal new pieces, and in the beginning of 1766 the excellent comedy of <HI>The Clande&s;tine Marriage,</HI> written in concert with Mr. Colman. He al&s;o, at the reque&s;t of his Maje&s;ty, appeared again upon the &s;tage; and on that occa&s;iou &s;poke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 201</NOTE> a new prologue, replete with tho&s;e &s;trokes
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="33">
of humour in which, in that &s;pecies of compo|&s;ition, he manife&s;ted a &s;uperiority over all his contemporaries.</P>
<P>In that year died Mr. Quin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Quin died the 21&s;t day of January, 1766; and Mrs. Cibber on the 30th of the &s;ame month.</NOTE> and Mrs. Cib|ber. Their deaths were very pathetically ta|ken notice of in the prologue to <HI>The Clande&s;tine Marriage;</HI> and for the former Mr. Garrick wrote an epitaph, which was placed over his tomb in the cathedral church of Bath. Mr. Quin was the only performer of any reputation when Mr. Garrick fir&s;t appeared on the &s;tage, and he had likewi&s;e been one of his earlie&s;t op|po&s;ers. For &s;everal years however before Mr. Quin's death great cordiality had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween him and Mr. Garrick, at who&s;e hou&s;e at Hampton he &s;pent &s;ome time a few months before his death, and there fir&s;t di&s;covered the &s;ymptoms of that di&s;order which carried him to his grave.</P>
<P>The year 1769 was remarkable for the cele|bration of a jubilee at Stratford upon Avon, the 6th, 7th, and 8th of September, in honour of Shake&s;peare; a ceremony which very much engaged the public attention. Although it was treated by &s;ome as a &s;ubject worthy only
<PB N="xxxv" REF="34">
of ridicule, yet by others it was deemed a ju&s;t compliment due to the great writer who&s;e me|mory was intended to be honoured by it. The circum&s;tance which gave ri&s;e to it happened &s;ome time before, and was as follows: A cler|gyman, into who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the hou&s;e once belonging to our great poet had come, found that a mulberry-tree, which grew in the garden, and which had been planted, according to tra|dition, by Shake&s;peare him&s;elf, over&s;hadowed his man&s;ion, and made it damp. To remedy this inconvenience, he cau&s;ed it to be cut down, to the great mortification of his neighbours, who were &s;o enraged at him, that they &s;oon rendered the place, out of revenge, too di&s;|agreeable for him to remain in it. He there|fore was obliged to quit it; and the tree, be|ing purcha&s;ed by a carpenter, was retailed, and cut out in various relicks of &s;tand-di&s;hes, tea|che&s;ts, tobacco-&s;toppers, and other things; &s;ome of which were obtained by the corpora|tion of Stratford. The gentlemen belonging to this body &s;oon after agreed to pre&s;ent Mr. Garrick with the freedom of their borough; and their &s;teward communicated their inten|tions to him in a letter, from whence the fol|lowing extract is taken: <Q REND="inline">"The corporation of
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="35">
Stratford, ever de&s;irous of expre&s;&s;ing their gra|titude to all who do honour and ju&s;tice to the memory of Shake&s;peare, and highly &s;en&s;ible that no per&s;on in any age hath excelled you therein, would think them&s;elves much honour'd if you would become one of their body. Tho' this borough doth not now &s;end members to parliament, perhaps the inhabitants may not be le&s;s virtuous; and, to render the freedom of this place the more acceptable to you, the corporation propo&s;e to &s;end it in a box made of that very mulberry tree planted by Shake&s;|peare's own hand. The &s;tory of that valuable relick is too long to be here in&s;erted: but the gentleman who is &s;o obliging as to convey this to you will acquaint you therewith; as al&s;o that the corporation would be happy in receiv|ing from your hands &s;ome &s;tatue, bu&s;t, or pic|ture of Shake&s;peare, to be placed within their new town-hall; they would be equally plea&s;ed to have &s;ome picture of your&s;elf, that the me|mory of both may be perpetuated together in that place which gave him birth, and where he &s;till lives in the mind of every inhabitant."</Q></P>
<P>The honour propo&s;ed in this letter to be con|ferred on Mr. Garrick was accepted by him; and the &s;ame compliment was paid to George

<P>The manner in which this entertainment was to have been performed, the di&s;appoint|ments it &s;u&s;tained, and the &s;everal occurrences
<PB N="xxxix" REF="38">
which took place at it, are all &s;o recent in the memories of mo&s;t of our readers, and were &s;o accurately related at the time they happened<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Victor's Hi&s;tory of the Theatres, Vol. III.</NOTE>, that we &s;hall not recapitulate them here. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that accident deprived tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent of part of their enter|tainment; that all which was exhibited gave general &s;atisfaction; and Mr. Garrick, who was a great &s;um of money out of pocket by it, framed an entertainment, which was performed at Drury-lane Theatre 92 nights with great applau&s;e to very crouded audiences. The ode which was &s;poken by him at Stratford was al&s;o repeated at the &s;ame theatre, but not with much &s;ucce&s;s, being performed only &s;even times<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This ode was parodied in an admirable burle&s;que, called "An Ode on dedicating a Building and erecting a Statue to Le Stue, Cook to the Duke of Newca&s;tle at Clermont." Reprinted, with Mr. Garrick's Ode, in Dilly's REPOSITORY, vol. I.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The management of a theatre is always at|tended with anxiety and vexation; the diffi|culty of &s;atisfying the &s;everal candidates for theatrical fame is &s;o great, that he who can pre&s;erve the friend&s;hip of tho&s;e who&s;e pieces he rejects, mu&s;t be allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s very extra|ordinary abilities. In the year 1772, it was
<PB N="xl" REF="39">
Mr. Garrick's misfortune to be embroiled with a very ira&s;cible and trouble&s;ome per&s;on, who claimed the repre&s;entation of one of his pieces at Drury-lane; and he inforced his demand in a manner that will &s;tamp indelible di&s;grace on his memory. He publi&s;hed a poem to intimi|date the manager, called <HI>Love in the Suds,</HI> con|taining in&s;inuations of the ba&s;e&s;t kind, and which he afterwards denied having had any in|tentions to convey. As this writer is dead, tho&s;e reflections on his conduct which had he been living might have appeared here, and which the &s;ubject naturally &s;ugge&s;ts, &s;hall be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed. It will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that Mr. Garrick had recour&s;e to the court of King's Bench, to puni&s;h the infamous libeller of his reputation; and, notwith&s;tanding he had been a &s;econd time in&s;ulted by another pub|lication conceived with equal malignity, he was weak enough to &s;top the pro&s;ecution he had commenced, on his adver&s;ary's &s;igning an acknowledgment of his offence, which was printed in all the public papers. It cannot be denied but that the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety demanded that &s;o gro&s;s an offender &s;hould meet with pu|ni&s;hment, and that no conce&s;&s;ions ought to have been allowed to deprecate that &s;troke which the law would have inflicted on &s;o heinous a crime.</P>

From this time no event of importance hap|pened, until the re&s;olution which Mr. Garrick had begun to form of quitting the &s;tage was, to the concern of every one, carried into exe|cution. In the beginning of the year 1776, he entered into an agreement with &s;ome of the pre&s;ent patentees, for the &s;ale of his intere&s;t in the theatre; but continued to act during the re|mainder of that &s;ea&s;on. The la&s;t night of his performance was for the Theatrical Fund, on the 10th day of June in that year, when he repre&s;ented the character of Don Felix in The Wonder. At the conclu&s;ion of the play he came forward, and addre&s;&s;ed the audience in a &s;hort &s;peech, wherein he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"it had been u&s;ual for per&s;ons in his &s;ituation to addre&s;s the publick in an epilogue; and that he had ac|cordingly turned his thoughts that way, but found it as impo&s;&s;ible to write, as it would be to &s;peak, a &s;tudied compo&s;ition; the jingle of rhyme and the language of fiction ill &s;uiting his then feelings: that the moment in which he then &s;poke was an awful one to him: that he had received innumerable favours, and took his leave on the &s;pot where tho&s;e favours were con|ferred."</Q> He then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"that, whatever the events of his future life might be, he &s;hould
<PB N="xlii" REF="41">
ever remember tho&s;e favours with the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction and deepe&s;t gratitude; and though he admitted the &s;uperior &s;kill and abilities of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, he defied them to exert them|&s;elves with more indu&s;try, zeal, and attention, than he had done."</Q> This &s;peech, which was delivered with all that emotion which the par|ticular &s;ituation of the &s;peaker rendered very intere&s;ting and affecting, was received with the loude&s;t bur&s;ts of applau&s;e; and he left the &s;tage with the acclamations of a numerous and polite audience, who were unable to forbear expre&s;&s;ing the deepe&s;t concern for the lo&s;s of their favou|rite performer.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick now retired to the enjoyment of his friends, the mo&s;t re&s;pectable in the king|dom, and of a large fortune, acquired in the cour&s;e of more than thirty years: but the &s;tone, which he had been afflicted with &s;ome time, had already made &s;uch inroads on his con&s;titution, that he was unable to communi|cate or receive from his friends that plea&s;ure which his company afforded, except at times, and in a very partial manner. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that he injured his health by the application of quack medicines, and often experienced the mo&s;t violent torments from the &s;everity of his
<PB N="xliii" REF="42">
di&s;order. At Chri&s;tmas 1778, he went to vi&s;it Lord Spencer at Althorp in Northampton|&s;hire, during the holidays. He there was taken ill; but recovered &s;o far that he was removed to town, where growing wor&s;e, he died in a few days afterwards, at his hou&s;e in the Adel|phi, on the 20th day of January, 1779, at the age of 63 years; leaving behind him the cha|racter of a friendly, humane, charitable, and (notwith&s;tanding many idle reports, we may add) liberal man; one who felt for di&s;tre&s;s, and relieved it; a chearful companion, a plea&s;|ing writer, and the fir&s;t actor of this or any other age.</P>

<P>The Author of the foregoing <HI>ODE</HI> has heard with plea&s;ure that what he had written from his con|cern for the death of a good and great man has been favourably received.

<P>BE it known unto you, gentle or ungentle reader, that the author of the following poem is a volunteer in the &s;ervice, or rather a poetical knight-errant, who, according to the oath taken at the late in&s;tallation, is <HI>exhortca and admoni&s;hed</HI> (by Apollo to be &s;ure) <HI>to u&s;e his &s;word in defence of all equity and ju&s;tice to the ut|mo&s;t of his power.</HI> His brother Quixote, of im|mortal memory, tried his prowe&s;s upon Sheep and Windmills&mdash;Our champion does the very &s;ame; and calls forth to the field an <HI>unknown</HI> knight, who has the formidable X, Y, Z, in his train.&mdash;And, that he may not be thought to en|gage with too great odds on his &s;ide, he oppo&s;es to them his own <HI>three tru&s;ty &s;quires,</HI> A, B, C, who are re&s;olved to &s;tand by him, and fight all the weapons through, from Epic Poetry to Epigram, as long as there is a letter left &s;tanding in the Engli&s;h alphabet&mdash;and now, Mr. Churchill may know, that there is<Q><L>&mdash;A Quixote of the age will dare,</L>
<L>To wage a war with dirt, and fight with air.</L></Q> When the afore&s;aid <HI>unknown</HI> knight &s;hall plea&s;e to appear with his <HI>beaver up,</HI> he may expect that our adventurer will &s;hew <HI>his face</HI> too.&mdash;In the
<PB N="14" REF="74">
mean time, we will divert him in our turn with a little <HI>bu&s;h</HI>-fighting, which he has been endea|vouring to entertain the town with for more than a twelvemonth pa&s;t.</P>
<P>It is therefore proper to inform thee, reader, for as yet perhaps thou ha&s;t not heard of it, that there is a certain weekly paper, called the Craft&s;|man, &s;till exi&s;ting, if it may be called exi&s;tence to crawl about from week to week, and be kept alive by tho&s;e la&s;t re&s;ources of hungry ingenuity, fal&s;ehood and defamation. In this &s;aid paper, a certain gentleman, who &s;ub&s;cribes him&s;elf X, Y, Z, a volunteer too in the &s;ervice, has thrown about his dirt in a mo&s;t extraordinary manner, and has attacked our Stage Hero, with unwearied male|volence, both in his public and private character; but, indeed, his rancour being too much for his wit, he has let his heart indulge it&s;elf at the ex|pence of his head, and has mo&s;t imprudently made a&s;&s;ertions, in the bitterne&s;s of his &s;pirit, which can be contradicted by every attender upon the theatre.&mdash;It would be endle&s;s, and out of place here, to point out his want of ta&s;te, and even common truth, in his account of the manner of Mr. Garrick's &s;peaking and acting in his various characters; of his mo&s;t ungentleman-like, as well as unju&s;t, abu&s;e of his per&s;on, voice, age, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.; for there is no kind of meanne&s;s, as Montaigne well ob&s;erves, that a true malignant &s;pirit will not de&s;cend to.&mdash;To give one in&s;tance

<L>What's ba&s;ely done, &s;hould be done &s;afely too;</L>

<HEAD>AN ODE UPON DEDICATING A BUILDING, AND ERECTING A STATUE, TO SHAKESPEARE, AT STRATFORD UPON AVON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Ode was &s;poken by Mr. GARRICK, 7th September, 1769, at Stratford upon Avon; and the en&s;uing Winter at Drury-Lane Theatre.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<P>COULD &s;ome gentlemen of ap|proved ability have been prevailed upon to do ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject of the following Ode, the pre&s;ent apology would have been unnece&s;&s;ary;&mdash;but as it was requi&s;ite to produce &s;omething of this kind upon the occa&s;ion, and the lot having unluckily fallen on the per&s;on perhaps the lea&s;t qualified to &s;ucceed in the attempt, it is hoped the candour of the public will e&s;teem the per|formance rather as an act of duty, than vanity in the author.</P>
<P>As &s;ome news-paper writers have illiberally endeavoured to &s;hake the poetic character of our immortal bard (too deeply indeed rooted in the heart to be affected by them) it is recommended to tho&s;e who are not &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed in their dramatic faith, to peru&s;e a work lately publi&s;hed, called, <HI>An E&s;&s;ay on the Genius and Writings of</HI> SHAKESPEARE, by which they will with much &s;atisfaction be convinced, that <HI>England</HI> may ju&s;tly boa&s;t the honour of producing the greate&s;t dra|matic poet in the world.</P>
<P>To &s;trengthen and ju&s;tify the general admira|tion of this a&s;toni&s;hing Genius, it has been
<PB N="56" REF="113">
thought proper to &s;ubjoin to the Ode &s;ome unde|niable te&s;timonies (both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e) of his unequalled original talents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are extracted from the Works of Ben Jon&s;on, Mil|ton, Dryden, Pope, Thom&s;on, John&s;on, Warton, Seward, Aken&s;ide, Gray, Ma&s;on, Churchill, Jago, Whitehead, Addi|&s;on, Rowe, Voltaire, Theobald, Hanmer, Lyttelton, Warburton, Dodd, Steevens, Capel, Hurd, Murphy, Colman, Walpole and Mrs. Montague. In the pre&s;ent collection they are omitted.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If it &s;hall be found, that <HI>&s;peaking</HI> that part of the Ode, which has u&s;ually been conveyed in re|citative, produces a better effect, the Author flatters him&s;elf he may lay claim to &s;ome little merit on that account: As to the Ode it&s;elf, he pre&s;ents it to the public as an object of their good-nature,&mdash;to his friends as an exerci&s;e of their partiality&mdash;to his enemies, as a lucky opportu|nity of venting their wit, humour, critici&s;m, &s;pleen, or whatever el&s;e they plea&s;e, &s;hould they think it worthy of their notice.</P>
