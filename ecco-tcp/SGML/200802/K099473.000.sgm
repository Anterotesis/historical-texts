<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_LET Mercenary <HI>Authors</HI> flatter the Great, and &s;ubject their Principle to Intere&s;t and Ambition, I &s;corn &s;uch &s;orbid Views; You only are Eminent in my Eyes: On You I look as the mo&s;t U&s;eful Member in a Body-Politic, and your Art far &s;uperior to all others: Therefore, <Q>Tu mihi Mecaenas Eris!</Q></P>
<P>O BRAUND, my Patron! my Plea&s;ure! my Pride! di&s;dain not to grace my Labours with a kind Peru&s;al. Su&s;pend a-while your more momentous Cares, and conde&s;cend to ta&s;te this little <HI>Frica&s;&s;ee</HI> of Mine.</P>
<P>I write not this, to Bite you by the Ear, <HI>(i. e.)</HI> flatter you out of a Brace or two of Guinea's: No; as I am a true <HI>Dumpling-Eater,</HI> my Views are purely <HI>Epicurean,</HI> and my utmo&s;t Hopes center'd in parta|king of &s;ome elegant <HI>Quelque Cho&s;e</HI> to&s;t up by your judicious Hand. I regard Money but as a Ticket which admits me to your Delicate Entertainments; to me much more Agreeable than all the Monkey-Tricks of Rival <HI>Harlequins,</HI> or <HI>Puppet-Show</HI> Finery of Con|tending <HI>Theatres.</HI></P>
<P>The Plague and Fatique of Dependance and At|tendance, which call me &s;o often to the Court-end of

the Town, were in&s;upportable, but for the Relief I find at AUSTIN's your Ingenious and Grateful Di&s;ciple, who has adorn'd <HI>New Bond-&s;treet</HI> with your Graceful <HI>Effigies.</HI> Nor can he fail of Cu&s;tom, who has hung out a Sign &s;o Alluring to all true <HI>Dumpling-Eaters.</HI> Many a time and oft have I gaz'd with Plea&s;ure on your Features, and trac'd in them the exact Lineaments of your glorious Ance&s;tor Sir JOHN BRAND, vulgarly call'd Sir JOHN PUDDING.</P>
<P>Tho' the Corruption of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Orthography in|dulges &s;ome appearance of Di&s;tinction between BRAND and BRAUND, yet in Effect they are one and the &s;ame thing. The ancient Manor of BRAND's, <HI>alias</HI> BRAUND's, near <HI>Kilburn</HI> in <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> was the very Manor-Hou&s;e of Sir JOHN BRAND, and is call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d BRAND's to this Day, altho' at pre&s;ent it be in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Family of MARSH.</P>
<P>What Honours are therefore due to One who is in a Direct Male Line, an Immediate De&s;cendant from the Loins of that Great Man!

<HEAD>A Learned Di&s;&s;ertation ON DUMPLING; Its Dignity, Antiquity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Dumpling-Eaters are a Race &s;prung partly from the old <HI>Epicurean,</HI> and partly from the <HI>Peripatetic Sect;</HI> they were brought fir&s;t into <HI>Britain</HI> by <HI>Julius Ce&s;ar;</HI> and finding it a Land of Plenty, they wi&s;ely re|&s;olv'd never to go Home again. Their Do|ctrines are Amphibious, and compos'd <HI>Party per Pale</HI> of the two Sects before-mention'd; from the <HI>Peripatetics,</HI> they derive their Prin|ciple
<PB N="2" REF="5">
of Walking, as a proper Method to dige&s;t a Meal, or create an Appetite; from the <HI>Epicureans,</HI> they maintain that all Plea|&s;ures are comprehended in good Eating and Drinking: And &s;o readily were their Opi|nions embrac'd, that every Day produc'd many Pro&s;elytes; and their Numbers have from Age to Age increas'd prodigiou&s;ly, in|&s;omuch that our whole I&s;land is over-run with them, at pre&s;ent. Eating and Drink|ing are become &s;o Cu&s;tomary among us, that we &s;eem to have entirely forgot, and laid a&s;ide the old Fa&s;hion of Fa&s;ting: In|&s;tead of having Wine &s;old at Apothecaries Shops, as formerly, every Street has two or three Taverns in it, lea&s;t the&s;e Dumpling-Eaters &s;hould faint by the Way; nay, &s;o zealous are they in the Cau&s;e of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> that one of the Chief among 'em has made a Vow never to &s;ay his Prayers 'till he has a Tavern <HI>of his own</HI> in every Street in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and in every Market-Town in <HI>England.</HI> What may we then in Time expect? Since by in&s;en&s;ible Degrees, their Society is become &s;o numerous and formidable, that they are with|out Number; other Bodies have their Meetings, but where can the Dumpling-Eaters a&s;&s;emble? what Place large enough to contain 'em! The <HI>Bank, India,</HI> and <HI>South-Sea</HI> Companies have their General Courts, the <HI>Free-Ma&s;ons</HI> and the <HI>Gormogons</HI> their Chapters; nay, our Friends
<PB N="3" REF="6">
the <HI>Quakers</HI> have their Yearly Meetings. And who would imagine any of the&s;e &s;hould be Dumpling-Eaters? But thus it is, the Dumpling-Eating Doctrine has &s;o far pre|vail'd among 'em, that they eat not only Dumplings, but <HI>Puddings,</HI> and tho&s;e in no &s;mall Quantities.</P>
<P>The Dumpling is indeed, of more antient In&s;titution, and of <HI>Foreign</HI> Origin; but alas, what were tho&s;e Dumplings? nothing but a few Lentils &s;odden together, moi&s;ten'd and cemented with a little &s;eeth'd Fat, not much unlike our Gritt or Oatmeal Pudding; yet were they of &s;uch E&s;teem among the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> that a Statue was erected to <HI>Fulvius Agricola,</HI> the fir&s;t Inventor of the&s;e Lentil Dumplings. How unlike the Grati|tude &s;hewn by the Publick to our Modern Projectors!</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans,</HI> tho' our Conquerors, found them&s;elves much out-done in Dumplings by our Fore-fathers; the <HI>Roman</HI> Dumplings were no more to compare to tho&s;e made by the <HI>Britons,</HI> than a Stone-Dumpling is to a Marrow Pudding; tho' indeed, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dumpling at that time, was little better than what we call a Stone-Dumpling, being no thing el&s;e but Flour and Water: But every Generation growing wi&s;er and wi&s;er, the
<PB N="4" REF="7">
Project was improv'd, and Dumpling grew to be Pudding: One Projector found Milk better than Water; another introduc'd But|ter; &s;ome added Marrow, others Plumbs; and &s;ome found out the U&s;e of Sugar; &s;o that, to &s;peak Truth, we know not where to fix the Genealogy or Chronology of any of the&s;e Pudding Projectors, to the Reproach of our Hi&s;torians, who eat &s;o much Pudding, yet have been &s;o Ungrateful to the fir&s;t Profe&s;&s;ors of this mo&s;t noble Science, as not to find 'em a Place in Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Invention of Eggs was merely acci|dental, two or three of which having ca|&s;ually roll'd from off a Shelf into a Pud|ding which a good Wife was making, &s;he found her&s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity either of throwing away her Pudding, or letting the Eggs remain, but concluding from the inno|cent Quality of the Eggs, that they would do no Hurt, if they did no Good. She wi&s;ely jumbl'd 'em all together, after having care|fully pick'd out the Shells; the Con&s;equence is ea&s;ily imagined, the Pudding became a Pudding of Puddings; and the U&s;e of Eggs from thence took its Date. The Woman was &s;ent for to Court to make Puddings for King <HI>John,</HI> who then &s;way'd the Scepter; and gain'd &s;uch Favour, that &s;he was the making of her whole Family. I cannot con|clude
<PB N="5" REF="8">
this Paragraph without owning, I re|ceiv'd this important Part of the Hi&s;tory of Pudding from old Mr. <HI>Lawrence</HI> of <HI>Wil&s;den-Green,</HI> the greate&s;t Antiquary of the pre|&s;ent Age.</P>
<P>From that Time the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> became &s;o famous for Puddings, that they are call'd Pudding-Eaters all over the World, to this Day.</P>
<P>At her Demi&s;e, her Son was taken into Favour, and made the King's chief Cook; and &s;o great was his Fame for Puddings, that he was call'd <HI>Jack Pudding</HI> all over the Kingdom, tho' in Truth, his real Name was <HI>John Barnes,</HI> as by the Records of the Kitchen you will find: This <HI>John Barnes,</HI> or <HI>Jack-Pudding,</HI> call him which you plea&s;e, the <HI>French</HI> have it <HI>Jean Boudin,</HI> for his Fame had reached <HI>France,</HI> who&s;e King would have given the World to have had our <HI>Jack</HI> for his Pudding-Maker. This <HI>Jack Pudding,</HI> I &s;ay, became yet a greater Fa|vourite than his Mother, in&s;omuch that he had the King's Ear as well as his Mouth at Command; for the King, you mu&s;t know, was a mighty Lover of Pudding; and <HI>Jack</HI> fitted him to a Hair, he knew how to make the mo&s;t of a Pudding; no Pudding came ami&s;s to him, he would make a Pud|ding
<PB N="6" REF="9">
out of a Flint-&s;tone, comparatively &s;peaking. It is needle&s;s to enumerate the many &s;orts of Pudding he made, &s;uch as Plain Pudding, Plumb Pudding, Marrow Pudding, Oatmeal Pudding, Carrot Pudding, Sauce&s;age Pudding, Bread Pudding, Flower Pudding, Suet Pudding, and in &s;hort, eve|ry Pudding but Quaking Pudding, which was &s;olely invented by, and took its Name from our Good Friends of the <HI>Bull and Mouth</HI> before mentioned, notwith&s;tanding the many Pretenders to that Projection.</P>
<P>But what rais'd our Hero mo&s;t in the E&s;teem of this Pudding-eating Monarch, was his Second Edition of Pudding, he be|ing the fir&s;t that ever invented the Art of Broiling Puddings, which he did to &s;uch Perfection, and &s;o much to the King's like|ing, (who had a mortal Aver&s;ion to Cold Pudding,) that he thereupon in&s;tituted him Knight of the Gridiron, and gave him a Gridiron of Gold, the En&s;ign of that Order, which he always wore as a Mark of his So|vereign's Favour; in &s;hort, <HI>Jack Pudding,</HI> or Sir <HI>John,</HI> grew to be all in all with good King <HI>John;</HI> he did nothing without him, they were Finger and Glove; and, if we may be|lieve Tradition, our very good Friend had no &s;mall Hand in the <HI>Magna Charta.</HI> If &s;o, how much are all <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> indebted
<PB N="7" REF="10">
to him? in what Repute ought the Order of the Gridiron to be, which was in&s;tituted to do Honour to this Wonderful Man? But alas! how &s;oon is Merit forgot? how im|pudently do the Vulgar turn the mo&s;t &s;e|rious Things into Ridicule, and mock the mo&s;t &s;olemn Trophies of Honour? for now every Fool at a Fair, or Zany at a Moun|tebank's Stage, is call'd <HI>Jack Pudding,</HI> has a Gridiron at his Back, and a great Pair of Spectacles at his Buttocks, to ri|dicule the mo&s;t noble Order of the Grid|iron. But their Spectacles is a mo&s;t un|grateful Reflection on the Memory of that great Man, who&s;e indefatigable Application to his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and deep Study in that occult Science, rendred him Poreblind; to remedy which Misfortune, he had always a 'Squire follow'd him, bearing a huge Pair of Spectacles to &s;addle his Honour's No&s;e, and &s;upply his much-lamented Defect of Sight. But whether &s;uch an Unhappine&s;s did not de&s;erve rather Pity than Ridicule, I leave to the Determination of all good Chri&s;tians: I cannot but &s;ay, it rai&s;es my Indignation, when I &s;ee the&s;e Paunch|gutted Fellows u&s;urping the Title and At|chievements of my dear Sir <HI>John,</HI> who&s;e Me|mory I &s;o much venerate, I cannot always contain my &s;elf. I remember, to my Co&s;t, I once carry'd my Re&s;entment a little
<PB N="8" REF="11">
farther than ordinary; in furiou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulting one of tho&s;e Ra&s;cals, I tore the Gridiron from his Back, and the Spectacles from his A&mdash;e; for which I was Apprehended, car|ried to Pye-powder Court, and by that tre|mendous Bench, &s;entenc'd to mo&s;t &s;evere Pains and Penalties.</P>
<P>This has indeed a little tam'd me, in&s;o|much that <HI>I</HI> keep my Fingers to my &s;elf, but at the &s;ame time let my Tongue run like a Devil: Forbear vile Mi&s;creants, cry I, where-e'er I meet the&s;e Wretches? forbear to a&s;cribe to your &s;elves the Name and Honours of Sir <HI>John Pudding?</HI> content your &s;elves with being <HI>Zanies, Pickled-Herrings, Punchionellos,</HI> but dare not &s;candalize the noble Name of <HI>Pudding:</HI> Nor can I, not|with&s;tanding the Clamours and Ill U&s;age of the Vulgar, refrain bearing my Te&s;ti|mony again&s;t this manife&s;t piece of In|ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>What Pity it is therefore, &s;o noble an Order &s;hould be lo&s;t, or at lea&s;t neglected. We have had no Account of the real Knights o&s; the Gridiron, &s;ince they appeared under the fictitious Name of the <HI>Kit-Kat Club:</HI> In their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was the very Grid|iron of Gold worn by Sir <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf; which Identical Gridiron dignified the Brea&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="12">
of the mo&s;t ingenious Mr. <HI>Richard E&s;tcourt</HI> that excellent Phy&s;ician and Comedian, who was Pre&s;ident of that Noble Society.</P>
<Q>Quis talia fando temperet &agrave; Lachrymis?</Q>
<P>What is become of the Gridiron, or of the Remains of that excellent Body of Men, Time will, I hope, di&s;cover. The World, I believe, mu&s;t for &s;uch Di&s;coveries be obliged to my very good Friend <HI>J&mdash; T&mdash;</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who had the Honour to be Door-keeper to that Honourable A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>But to return to Sir <HI>John:</HI> The more his Wit engaged the King, the more his Grandeur alarm'd his Enemies, who encreas'd with his Honours. Not but the Courtiers care&s;s'd him to a Man, as the fir&s;t who had brought Dumpling-eating to Perfection. King <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf lov'd him entirely; being of <HI>Ce|&s;ar</HI>'s Mind, that is, he had a natural Antipathy again&s;t Meagre, Herring-gutted Wretches; he lov'd only <HI>Fat-headed Men, and &s;uch, who &s;lept o' Nights;</HI> and of &s;uch was his whole Court compos'd. Now it was Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Method, every <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, to give the Courtiers a Breakfa&s;t, which Breakfa&s;t was every Man his Dumpling and Cup of Wine; for you mu&s;t know, he
<PB N="10" REF="13">
was Yeoman of the Wine-Cellar at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>This was a great Eye-&s;ore and Heart|burning to &s;ome Lubberly Abbots who loung'd about the Court; they took it in great Dudgeon they were not In|vited, and &s;tuck &s;o clo&s;e to his Skirts, that they never re&s;ted 'till they Outed him. They told the King, who was naturally very Ha&s;ty, that Sir <HI>John</HI> made-away with his Wine, and fea&s;ted his Paramours at his Ex|pence; and not only &s;o, but that they were forming a De&s;ign again&s;t his Life, which they in Con&s;cience ought to di&s;cover: That Sir <HI>John</HI> was not only an Heretic, but an Heathen; nay wor&s;e, they fear'd he was a Witch, and that he had bewitcht His Ma|je&s;ty into that unaccountable Fondne&s;s for a <HI>Pudding-Maker.</HI> They a&s;&s;ur'd the King, That on a <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, in&s;tead of being at Mattins, he and his Trigrimates got to|gether Hum-jum, all &s;nug, and perform'd many Helli&s;h and Diabolical Ceremonies. In &s;hort, they made the King believe that the Moon was made of Green-Chee&s;e: And to &s;hew how the Innocent may be Be|ly'd, and the be&s;t Intentions mi&s;repre&s;ented, they told the King, That He and his A&s;&s;o|ciates offer'd Sacrifices to <HI>Ceres:</HI> When, alas, it was only the Dumplings they eat.
<PB N="11" REF="14">
The Butter which was melted and pour'd over them, the&s;e vile Mi&s;creants call'd <HI>Liba|tions:</HI> And the friendly Compotations of our Dumpling-eaters, were call'd <HI>Bacchanalian Rites.</HI> Two or three among 'em being &s;weet-tooth'd, wou'd &s;trew a little Sugar over their Dumplings; this was repre&s;ented as an <HI>Heatheni&s;h Offering.</HI> In &s;hort, not one Action of theirs, but what the&s;e Ra&s;cally Abbots made Criminal, and never let the King alone 'till poor Sir <HI>John</HI> was Di&s;carded. Not but the King did it with the greate&s;t Reluctance; but they had made it a Religious Concern, and he cou'd not get off on't.</P>
<P>But mark the Con&s;equence: The King never enjoy'd him&s;elf after, nor was it long before he was poi&s;on'd by a Monk at <HI>Swines-head</HI> Abbey. Then too late he &s;aw his Er|ror; then he lamented the Lo&s;s of Sir <HI>John;</HI> and in his late&s;t Moments wou'd cry out, Oh! that I had never parted from my dear <HI>Jack Pudding!</HI> Wou'd I had never left off Pudding and Dumpling! I then had never been thus ba&s;ely Poi&s;on'd! never thus treacherou&s;ly &s;ent out of the World!&mdash;Thus did this good King lament: But, alas, to no Purpo&s;e, the Prie&s;t had given him his Bane, and Complaints were inef|fectual.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15">
Sir <HI>John,</HI> in the mean time, had retir'd into <HI>Norfolk,</HI> where his diffu&s;ive Knowledge extended it &s;elf for the Good of the County in general; and from that very Cau&s;e <HI>Nor|folk</HI> has ever &s;ince been &s;o famous for Dumplings. He lamented the King's Death to his very la&s;t; and was &s;o cautious of being poi&s;on'd by the Prie&s;ts, that he never touch'd a Wafer to the Day of his Death: And had it not been that &s;ome of the le&s;s|de&s;igning part of the Clergy were his inti|mate Friends, and eat daily of his Dump|lings, he had doubtle&s;s been Made-away with; out they &s;tood in the Gap for him, for the &s;ake of his Dumplings, knowing that when Sir <HI>John</HI> was gone, they &s;hould never have the like again.</P>
<P>But our facetious Knight was too free of his Talk to be long &s;ecure; for a Hole was pick'd in his Coat in the &s;ucceeding Reign, and poor Sir <HI>John</HI> had all his Goods and Chattels forfeited to the King's U&s;e. It was then time for him to be&s;tir him&s;elf; and away to Court he goes, to recover his Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not doubting but he had Friends there &s;ufficient to carry his Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But alas! how was he mi&s;taken; not a Soul there knew him; the very Porters
<PB N="13" REF="16">
u&s;ed him rudely. In vain did he &s;eek for Acce&s;s to the King, to vindicate his Con|duct. In vain did he claim Acquaintance with the Lords of the Court; and reap up old Civilities, to remind 'em of former Kindne&s;s; the Pudding was eat, the Obli|gation was over: Which made Sir <HI>John</HI> compo&s;e that excellent Proverb, <HI>Not a word of the Pudding.</HI> And finding all Means in|effectual, he left the Court in a great Pet; yet not without pa&s;&s;ing a &s;evere Joke upon 'em, in his way, which was this; He &s;ent a Pudding to the King's Table, under the Name of a <HI>Court-Pudding,</HI> or <HI>Promi&s;e-Pudding.</HI> This Pudding he did not fail to &s;et off with large Encomiums; a&s;&s;uring the King, That therein he wou'd find an Hiero|glyphical Definition of Courtiers Promi&s;es and Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>This cau&s;ed &s;ome Speculation; and the King's Phy&s;ician debarr'd the King from ta&s;ting the Pudding, not knowing but that Sir <HI>John</HI> had poi&s;on'd it.</P>
<P>But how great a Fit of Laughter en&s;u'd, may be ea&s;ily gue&s;s'd, when the Pudding was cut up, it prov'd only a large Bladder, ju&s;t clos'd over with Pa&s;te: The Bladder was full of Wind, and nothing el&s;e, except|ing the&s;e Ver&s;es written in a Roll of Paper,
<PB N="14" REF="17">
and put in, as is &s;uppos'd, before the Blad|der was blown full: <Q><L><HI REND="blackletterType">As Wynde in a Bladdere ypent,</HI></L>
<L><HI REND="blackletterType">is Lordings promy&s;e and &s;erment;</HI></L>

<L><HI REND="blackletterType">and &s;ain another in her &s;peaking:</HI></L>

<L><HI REND="blackletterType">but when the Symnel it is eten,</HI></L>
<L><HI REND="blackletterType">her curte&s;&s;e is all foryetten.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>This Adventure met with various Con|&s;tructions from tho&s;e at Table: Some Laugh'd; others Frown'd. But the King took the Joke by the right End, and Laugh'd outright.</P>
<P>The Ver&s;es, tho' but &s;curvy ones in them|&s;elves, yet in tho&s;e Days pa&s;s'd for tolerable: Nay, the King was mightily pleas'd with 'em, and play'd 'em off on his Courtiers as Occa&s;ion &s;erv'd; he wou'd &s;top 'em &s;hort in the middle of a flattering Harangue, and cry, <HI>Not a Word of the Pudding.</HI> This wou'd daunt and mortify 'em to the la&s;t degree; they curs'd Sir <HI>John</HI> a thou&s;and times over for the Proverb's &s;ake: but to
<PB N="15" REF="18">
no Purpo&s;e; for the King gave him a pri|vate Hearing: In which he &s;o well &s;atisfy'd His Maje&s;ty of his Innocence and Integrity, that all his Lands were re&s;tor'd. The King wou'd have put him in his old Po&s;t; but he mode&s;tly declin'd it, but at the &s;ame time pre&s;ented His Maje&s;ty with a Book of mo&s;t excellent Receipts for all kinds of Puddings: Which Book His Maje&s;ty re|ceiv'd with all imaginable Kindne&s;s, and kept it among his greate&s;t Rarities.</P>
<P>But yet, as the be&s;t In&s;tructions, tho' never &s;o &s;trictly follow'd, may not be al|ways as &s;ucce&s;sfully executed, &s;o not one of the King's Cooks cou'd make a Pudding like Sir <HI>John;</HI> nay, tho' he made a Pudding before their Eyes, yet they out of the very &s;ame Materials could not do the like. Which made his old Friends the Monks at|tribute it to Witchcraft, and it was currently reported the Devil was his Helper. But good King <HI>Harry</HI> was not to be fobb'd off &s;o; the Pudding was good, it &s;ate very well on his Stomach, and he eat very &s;avourly, without the lea&s;t Remor&s;e of Con|&s;cience.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Sir <HI>John</HI> grew in Favour in &s;pite of their Teeth: The King lov'd a merry Joke; and Sir <HI>John</HI> had al|ways
<PB N="16" REF="19">
his Budget full of Punns, Connun|drums and Carrawitchets; not to forget the Quibbles and Fly-flaps he play'd again&s;t his Adver&s;aries, at which the King has laugh'd 'till his Sides crackt.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John,</HI> tho' he was no very great Scholar, yet had a happy way of Expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf: He was a Man of the mo&s;t En|gaging Addre&s;s, and never fail'd to draw Attention: Plenty and Good-Nature &s;mil'd in his Face; his Mu&s;cles were never di&s;torted with Anger or Contemplation, but an eternal Smile drew up the Corners of his Mouth; his very Eyes laugh'd; and as for his Chin it was three-double, a-down which hung a goodly Whey-colour'd Beard &s;hining with the Drippings of his Luxury; for you mu&s;t knew he was a great Epicure, and had a very Sen&s;ible Mouth; he thought nothing too|good for him&s;elf, all his Care was for his Belly; and his Palate was &s;o exqui&s;ite, that it was the perfect Standard of Ta&s;ting. So that to him we owe all that is elegant in Eating: For Pudding was not his only Talent, he was a great Virtuo&s;o in all manner of Eatables; and tho' he might come &s;hort of <HI>Lambert</HI> for Confectionary-Niceties, yet was he not inferiour to <HI>Brawnd, Lebec, Pede,</HI> or any other great Ma&s;ters of Cookery; he could to&s;s up a Frica&s;&s;&eacute;e as well as a Pan|cake:
<PB N="17" REF="20">
And mo&s;t of the Kick&s;haws now in vogue, are but his Inventions, with other Names; for what we call <HI>Frica&s;&s;&eacute;es,</HI> he call'd <HI>Pancakes;</HI> as, a Pancake of Chickens, a Pancake of Rabbets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nay, the <HI>French</HI> call a Pudding an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fri|ca&s;&s;&eacute;e, to this Day.</P>
<P>We value our &s;elves mightily for Roa&s;ting a Hare with a Pudding in its Belly; when alas he has roa&s;ted an Ox with a Pudding in his Belly. There was no Man like him for Invention and Contrivance: And then for Execution, he &s;par'd no Labour and Pains to com|pa&s;s his magnanimous De&s;igns.</P>
<P>O wou'd to Heav'n this little Attempt of Mine may &s;tir up &s;ome <HI>Pudding-headed Antiquary</HI> to dig his Way through all the mouldy Records of Antiquity, and bring to Light the Noble Actions of Sir <HI>John!</HI> It will not then be long before we &s;ee him on the Stage. Sir <HI>John Fal&s;taffe</HI> then will be a Shrimp to Sir <HI>John Pudding,</HI> when rais'd from Oblivion and reanimated by the All-Invigorating Pen of the Well-Fed, Well-Read, Well-Pay'd <HI>C&mdash; J&mdash;</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Nor wou'd this be all; for the Pa&s;try-Cooks wou'd from the Hands of an eminent Phy|&s;ician and Poet receive whole Loads of
<PB N="18" REF="21">
Memorandums, to remind 'em of the Gra|titude due to Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Memory.</P>
<P>On &s;uch a Subject I hope to &s;ee Sir <HI>Richard</HI> Out-do him&s;elf. Nor <HI>Arthur</HI> nor <HI>Eliza</HI> &s;hall with Sir <HI>John</HI> compare. There is not &s;o much differenee between a Tele&s;cope and a Powder-Puff, a Hoop-Petty-Coat and a Farthing-Candle, a Birch-Broom and a Diamond-Ring, as there will be between the former Writings of this pair of Poets and their Lucubrations on this Head.</P>
<P>Nor will it &s;top here: The <HI>Opera</HI> Compo&s;ers &s;hall have t'other Conte&s;t, which &s;hall be&s;t &s;ing-forth his Prai&s;es. Sorry am I that <HI>Nicolino</HI> is not here, he would have made an excellent Sir <HI>John.</HI> But <HI>Sene&s;ino,</HI> being blown up after the manner that Butchers blow Calves, may do well enough. From thence the Painters and Print-&s;ellers &s;hall retail his goodly Phiz; and what <HI>Sacheverel</HI> was, &s;hall Sir <HI>John Pudding</HI> be; his Head &s;hall hang Elate on every Sign, his Fame &s;hall ring in every Street, and <HI>Cluer</HI>'s Pre&s;s &s;hall teem with Ballads to his Prai&s;e. This would be but Honour, this would be but Gratitude, from a Generation &s;o much indebted to &s;o Great a Man.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="22">
But how much do we deviate from Honour and Gratitude, when we put other Names to his Inventions, and call 'em our own? What is a Tart, a Pie, or a Pa&s;ty, but Meat or Fruit enclos'd in a Wall or Covering of Pudding. What is a Cake, but a Bak'd Pudding; or a <HI>Chri&s;tmas-Pie,</HI> but a Minc'd-Meat-Pudding. As for Chee&s;e-cakes, Cu&s;tards, Tan&s;ies, they are manife&s;t Puddings, and all of Sir <HI>John</HI>'s own Contrivance; for Cu&s;tard is as old if not older than <HI>Magna Charta.</HI> In &s;hort, Pudding is of the greate&s;t Dignity and Antiquity. Bread it &s;elf, which is the very Staff of Life, is, properly &s;peaking, a Bak'd Wheat-Pudding.</P>
<P>To the Satchel, which is the Pudding-Bag of Ingenuity, we are indebted for the greate&s;t Men in Church and State. All Arts and Sciences owe their Original to Pudding or Dumpling. What is a Bag-Pipe, the Mother of all Mu&s;ic, but a Pudding of Harmony. And what is Mu&s;ic it &s;elf, but a Palatable Cookery of Sounds. To little Puddings or Bladders of Colours we owe all the choice Originals of the Greate&s;t Painters: And indeed, what is Painting, but a well-&s;pread Pudding, or Cookery of Colours.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="23">
The Head of Man is like a Pudding: And whence have all Rhimes, Poems, Plots and Inventions &s;prang, but from that &s;ame Pudding. What is Poetry, but a Pudding of Words. The Phy&s;icians, tho' they cry out &s;o much again&s;t Cooks and Cookery, yet are but Cooks them&s;elves; with this difference only, the Cooks Pudding lengthens Life, the Phy&s;icians &s;hortens it. So that we Live and Die by Pudding. For what is a Cly&s;ter, but a Bag-Pudding; a Pill, but a Dumpling; or a Bolus, but a Tan&s;y, tho' not altogether &s;o Tooth&s;ome. In a word; Phy&s;ick is only a Puddingizing or Cookery of Drugs. The Law is but a Cookery of Quibbles and Contentions. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Cat run away with this part of the Copy, on which the Author had unfortunately laid &s;ome of Mother <HI>Crump</HI>'s Sau&s;ages.</NOTE>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * is but a Pudding of * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *. Some &s;wallow every thing whole and unmix'd; &s;o that it may rather be call'd a Heap, than a Pudding. Others are &s;o Squeami&s;h, the greate&s;t Ma&s;ter&s;hip in Cookery is requir'd to make the Pud|ding Palatable: The Suet which others gape and &s;wallow by Gobs, mu&s;t for the&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="24">
puny Stomachs be minced to Atoms; the Plums mu&s;t be pick'd with the utmo&s;t Care, and every Ingredient proportion'd to the greate&s;t Nicety, or it will never go down.</P>
<P>The Univer&s;e it &s;elf is but a Pudding of Elements. Empires, Kingdoms, States and Republicks are but Puddings of People dif|ferently made up. The Cele&s;tial and Ter|re&s;trial Orbs are decypher'd to us by a pair of Globes or Mathematical Puddings.</P>
<P>The Succe&s;s of War and Fate of Monar|chies are entirely dependant on Puddings and Dumplings: For what el&s;e are Cannon-Balls, but Military Puddings; or Bullets, but Dumplings; only with this difference, they do not &s;it &s;o well on the Stomach as a good Marrow-Pudding or Bread-Pudding.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, There is nothing valuable in Nature, but what, more or le&s;s, has an Allu&s;ion to Pudding or Dumpling. Why then &s;hould they be held in Di&s;e&s;teem? Why &s;hould Dumpling-Eating be ridicul'd, or Dumpling-Eaters derided? Is it not Plea&s;ant and Profitable? Is it not An|cient and Honourable? Kings, Princes, and Potentates have in all Ages been Lovers of Pudding. Is it not therefore
<PB N="22" REF="25">
of Royal Authority? Popes, Cardinals, Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Deacons have, Time out of Mind, been great Pudding-Eaters: Is it not therefore a Holy and Religious In&s;titution? Philo&s;ophers, Poets, and Learned Men in all Faculties, Judges, Privy-Councellors, and Members of both Hou&s;es, have, by their great Regard to Pudding, given a Sanction to it that no|thing can efface. Is it not therefore An|cient, Honourable, and Commendable?</P>
<Q>Quare itaque fremuerunt Auctores?</Q>
<P>Why do therefore the Enemies of good Eating, the Starve-gutted Authors of <HI>Grub|&s;treet,</HI> employ their impotent Pens again&s;t Pudding and Pudding-headed, <HI>ali&agrave;s</HI> Hone&s;t Men? Why do they inveigh again&s;t Dum|pling-Eating which is the Life and Soul of Good-fellow&s;hip, and Dumpling-Eaters who are the Ornaments of Civil Society.</P>
<P>But, alas! their Malice is their own Puni&s;hment. The Hireling Author of a late &s;candalous Libel, intituled, <HI>The Dumpling-Eaters Downfall,</HI> may, if he has any Eyes, now &s;ee his Error, in attack|ing &s;o Numerous, &s;o Augu&s;t a Body of People: His Books remain Un&s;old, Un|read, Unregarded; while this Treati&s;e of
<PB N="23" REF="26">
Mine &s;hall be Bought by all who love Pud|ding or Dumpling; to my Book&s;eller's great Joy, and my no &s;mall Con&s;olation. How &s;hall I Triumph, and how will that Mer|cenary Scribbler be Mortify'd, when I have &s;old more Editions of my Books, than he has Copies of his! I therefore exhort all People, Gentle and Simple, Men, Women and Children, to Buy, to Read, to Extol the&s;e Labours of Mine, for the Honour of Dumpling-Eating. Let them not fear to defend every Article; for I will bear them Harmle&s;s: I have Arguments good &s;tore, and can ea&s;ily Confute, either Lo|gically, Theologically, or Metaphy&s;ically, all tho&s;e who dare Oppo&s;e me.</P>
<P>Let not <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> therefore be a&s;ham'd of the Name of <HI>Pudding-Eaters;</HI> but, on the contrary, let it be their Glory. For let Foreigners cry out ne'er &s;o much again&s;t Good Eating, they come ea&s;ily into it when they have been a little while in our <HI>Land of Canaan;</HI> and there are very few Foreign|ers among us who have not learn'd to make as great a Hole in a good Pudding or Sirloin of Beef as the be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> of us all.</P>
<P>Why &s;hou'd we then be Laught out of Pudding and Dumpling? or why
<PB N="24" REF="27">
Ridicul'd out of Good Living? Plots and Politics may hurt us, but Pudding can|not. Let us therefore adhere to Pud|ding, and keep our &s;elves out of Harm's Way; according to the Golden Rule laid down by a celebrated Dumpling-Eater now defunct; <Q><L>Be of your Patron's Mind, whate'er he &s;ays:</L>
<L>Sleep very much; Think little, and Talk le&s;s:</L>
<L>Mind neither Good nor Bad, nor Right nor Wrong;</L>
<L>But Eat your Pudding, Fool, and Hold your Tongue.</L>
<BIBL>PRIOR.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The Author of the&s;e excellent Lines not only &s;hews his Wi&s;dom, but his Good-Breeding, and great E&s;teem for the Memory of Sir <HI>John,</HI> by giving his <HI>Poem</HI> the Title of <HI>Merry Andrew,</HI> and making <HI>Merry Andrew</HI> the principal Spoke&s;man: For if I gue&s;s aright, and &s;urely I gue&s;s not wrong, his main De&s;ign was, to a&s;certain the Name of <HI>Merry Andrew</HI> to the <HI>Fool</HI> of a Droll, and to &s;ub&s;titute it in&s;tead of <HI>Jack Pudding;</HI> which Name my Friend <HI>Matt.</HI> cou'd not hear with Temper, as carrying with

it an oblique Reflection on Sir <HI>John Pud|ding</HI> the Hero of this DUMPLEID.</P>
<P>Let all tho&s;e therefore who have any Re|gard to Politene&s;s and Propriety of Speech, take heed how they Err again&s;t this Rule laid down by him who was the Standard of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Elegance.
