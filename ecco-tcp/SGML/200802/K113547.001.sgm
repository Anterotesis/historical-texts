<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MY Book&s;eller having informed me that there was no collection of Engli&s;h Poetry among us, of any e&s;tima|tion, I thought a few Hours &s;pent in making a proper &s;election would not be ill be&s;towed. Compilations of this kind are chiefly de&s;igned for &s;uch as either want lei&s;ure, &s;kill, or fortune, to choo&s;e for them&s;elves; for per&s;ons who&s;e profe&s;&s;ions turn them to different pur&s;uits, or who, not yet arrived at &s;ufficient maturity, re|quire a guide to direct their application. To our youth, particularly, a publication
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
of this &s;ort may be u&s;eful; &s;ince, if com|piled with any &s;hare of judgement, it may at once unite precept and example, &s;hew them what is beautiful, and inform them why it is &s;o: I therefore offer this, to the be&s;t of my judgement, as the be&s;t collec|tion that has yet appeared: though, as ta&s;tes are various, numbers will be of a very different opinion. Many perhaps may wi&s;h to &s;ee in it the poems of their favourite Authors, others may wi&s;h that I had &s;elected from works le&s;s generally read, and others &s;till may wi&s;h, that I had &s;e|lected from their own. But my de&s;ign was to give a u&s;eful, unaffected compila|tion; one that might tend to advance the reader's ta&s;te, and not impre&s;s him with exalted ideas of mine. Nothing &s;o com|mon, and yet &s;o ab&s;urd, as affectation in critici&s;m. The de&s;ire of being thought to
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
have a more di&s;cerning ta&s;te than others, has often led writers to labour after error, and to be foremo&s;t in promoting deformity. In this compilation I run but few ri&s;ques of that kind; every poem here is well known, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or the public has been long mi&s;taken, of peculiar merit: every poem has, as Ari&s;totle expre&s;&s;es it, a beginning, a middle, and an end, in which, however trifling the rule may &s;eem, mo&s;t of the poetry in our language is deficient: I claim no merit in the choice, as it was obvious, for in all languages the be&s;t productions are mo&s;t ea&s;ily found. As to the &s;hort introductory critici&s;ms to each poem, they are rather de&s;igned for boys than men; for it will be &s;een that I declined all refinement, &s;atisfied with being obvious and &s;incere. In &s;hort, if this work be u&s;eful in &s;chools, or amu&s;ing in
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
the clo&s;et, the merit all belongs to others; I have nothing to boa&s;t, and, at be&s;t, can expect, not applau&s;e, but pardon.</P>

<HEAD>The Rape of the Lock.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>This &s;eems to be Mr. Pope's mo&s;t fini&s;hed produc|tion, and is, perhaps, the mo&s;t perfect in our language. It exhibits &s;tronger powers of imagina|tion, more harmony of numbers, and a greater knowledge of the world, than any other of this poet's works: and it is probable, if our country were called upon to &s;hew a &s;pecimen of their ge|nius to foreigners, this would be the work here fixed upon.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>WHAT dire offence from am'rous cau&s;es &s;prings,</L>
<L>What mighty conte&s;ts ri&s;e from trivial things,</L>
<L>I &s;ing&mdash;This ver&s;e to CARYL, Mu&s;e! is due:</L>
<L>This, ev'n Belinda may vouch&s;afe to view:</L>
<L>Slight is the &s;ubject, but not &s;o the prai&s;e,</L>
<L>If She in&s;pire, and He approve my lays.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="9">Say what &s;trange motive, Godde&s;s! could compel</L>
<L>A well-bred Lord t'a&s;&s;ault a gentle Belle?</L>
<L>O &s;ay what &s;tranger cau&s;e, yet unexplor'd,</L>
<L>Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord?</L>
<L>In ta&s;ks &s;o bold, can little men engage,</L>
<L>And in &s;oft bo&s;oms dwells &s;uch mighty rage?</L>
<L>Sol thro' white curtains &s;hot a tim'rous ray,</L>
<L>And ope'd tho&s;e eyes that mu&s;t eclip&s;e the day:</L>
<L>Now lap-dogs gave them&s;elves the rouzing &s;hake,</L>
<L>And &s;leeple&s;s lovers, ju&s;t at twelve, awake:</L>
<L>Thrice rung the bell, the &s;lipper knock'd the ground,</L>
<L>And the pre&s;s'd watch return'd a &s;ilver &s;ound.</L>
<L>Belinda &s;till her downy pillow pre&s;t;</L>
<L>Her guardian SYLPH prolong'd the balmy re&s;t:</L>
<L>'Twas He had &s;ummon'd to her &s;ilent bed</L>
<L>The morning dream that hover'd o'er her head.</L>
<L>A youth more glitt'ring than a birth-night beau,</L>
<L>(That ev'n in &s;lumber caus'd her cheek to glow)</L>
<L>Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay,</L>
<L>And thus in whi&s;pers &s;aid, or &s;eem'd to &s;ay.</L>
<L>Faire&s;t of mortals, thou di&s;tingui&s;h'd care</L>
<L>Of thou&s;and bright inhabitants of air!</L>
<L>If e'er one Vi&s;ion touch thy infant thought,</L>
<L>Of all the Nur&s;e and all the Prie&s;t have taught;</L>
<L>Of airy Elves by moonlight &s;hadows &s;een,</L>
<L>The &s;ilver token, and the circled green,</L>
<L>Or virgins vi&s;ited by Angel-pow'rs,</L>
<L>With golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs;</L>
<L>Hear and believe! thy own importance know,</L>
<L>Nor bound thy narrow views to things below.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="10">Some &s;ecret truths, from learned pride conceal'd,</L>
<L>To Maids alone and children are reveal'd:</L>
<L>What tho' no credit doubting Wits may give,</L>
<L>The Fair and Innocent &s;hall &s;till believe.</L>
<L>Know, then, unnumbered Spirits round thee fly,</L>
<L>The light Militia of the lower &s;ky:</L>
<L>The&s;e, tho' un&s;een, are ever on the wing,</L>
<L>Hang o'er the Box, and hover round the Ring.</L>
<L>Think what an equipage thou ha&s;t in air,</L>
<L>And view with &s;corn two Pages and a Chair.</L>
<L>As now your own, our beings were of old,</L>
<L>And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous mould;</L>
<L>Thence, by a &s;oft tran&s;ition, we repair</L>
<L>From earthly vehicles to the&s;e of air.</L>
<L>Think not, when Woman's tran&s;ient breath is fled,</L>
<L>That all her vanities at once are dead;</L>
<L>Succeeding vanities &s;he &s;till regards,</L>
<L>And, tho' &s;he plays no more, o'erlooks the cards.</L>
<L>Her joy in gilded Chariots, when alive,</L>
<L>And love of Ombre, after death &s;urvive.</L>
<L>For when the Fair in all their pride expire,</L>
<L>To their fir&s;t Elements their Souls retire:</L>
<L>The &s;prites of fiery Termagants in Flame</L>
<L>Mount up, and take a Salamander's name.</L>
<L>Soft yielding minds to Water glide away,</L>
<L>And &s;ip, with nymphs, their elemental tea.</L>
<L>The graver Prude &s;inks downward to a Gnome,</L>
<L>In &s;earch of mi&s;chief &s;till on Earth to roam.</L>
<L>The light Coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair,</L>
<L>And &s;port and flutter in the fields of air.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="11">Know farther yet; whoever, fair and cha&s;te,</L>
<L>Rejects mankind, is by &s;ome Sylph embrac'd:</L>
<L>For Spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ea&s;e</L>
<L>A&s;&s;ume what &s;exes and what &s;hapes they plea&s;e.</L>
<L>What guards the purity of melting maids,</L>
<L>In courtly balls, and midnight ma&s;querades,</L>
<L>Safe from the treach'rous friend, the daring &s;park,</L>
<L>The glance by day, the whi&s;per in the dark,</L>
<L>When kind occa&s;ion prompts their warm de&s;ires,</L>
<L>Whe mu&s;ic &s;oftens, and when dancing fires?</L>
<L>'Tis but their Sylph, the wi&s;e Cele&s;tials know,</L>
<L>Tho' Honour is the word with Men below.</L>
<L>Some nymphs there are, too con&s;cious of their face,</L>
<L>For life prede&s;tin'd to the Gnomes embrace.</L>
<L>The&s;e &s;well their pro&s;pects and exalt their pride,</L>
<L>When offers are di&s;dain'd, and love deny'd:</L>
<L>Then gay ideas croud the vacant brain,</L>
<L>While Peers, and Dukes, and all their &s;weeping train,</L>
<L>And Garters, Stars, and Coronets appear,</L>
<L>And, in &s;oft &s;ounds, Your Grace &s;alutes their ear.</L>
<L>'Tis the&s;e that early taint the female &s;oul,</L>
<L>In&s;truct the eyes of young Coquettes to roll,</L>
<L>Teach infant cheeks a bidden blu&s;h to know,</L>
<L>And little hearts to flutter at a Beau.</L>
<L>Oft, when the world imagine women &s;tray,</L>
<L>The Sylphs thro' my&s;tic mazes guide their way,</L>
<L>Thro' all the giddy circle they pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>And old impertinence expel by new.</L>
<L>What tender maid but mu&s;t a victim fall</L>
<L>To one man's treat, but for another's ball?</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="12">When Florio &s;peaks, what virgin could with&s;tand,</L>
<L>If gentle Damon did not &s;queeze her hand;</L>
<L>With varying vanities, from ev'ry part</L>
<L>They &s;hift the moving Toy-&s;hop of their heart;</L>
<L>Where wigs with wigs, with &s;word-knots &s;word-knots &s;trive,</L>
<L>Beaux bani&s;h beaux, and coaches coaches drive.</L>
<L>This erring mortals Levity may call,</L>
<L>Oh blind to truth! the Sylphs contrive it all.</L>
<L>Of the&s;e am I, who thy protection claim;</L>
<L>A watchful &s;prite, and Ariel is my name.</L>
<L>Late, as I rang'd the cry&s;tal wilds of air,</L>
<L>In the clear Mirror of thy ruling &s;tar</L>
<L>I &s;aw, alas, &s;ome dread event impend,</L>
<L>Ere to the main this morning &s;un de&s;cend;</L>
<L>But heav'n reveals not what, or how, or where:</L>
<L>Warn'd by the Sylph, oh pious maid, beware!</L>
<L>This to di&s;clo&s;e is all thy guardian can:</L>
<L>Beware of all; but, mo&s;t, beware of Man!</L>
<L>He &s;aid; when Shock, who thought &s;he &s;lept too long,</L>
<L>Leap'd up, and wak'd his mi&s;tre&s;s with his tongue.</L>
<L>'Twas then, Belinda, if report &s;ay true,</L>
<L>Thy eyes fir&s;t open'd on a Billet-doux;</L>
<L>Wounds, Charms, and Ardors, were no &s;ooner read,</L>
<L>But all the Vi&s;ion vani&s;h'd from thy head.</L>
<L>And now, unveil'd, the Toilet &s;tands di&s;play'd,</L>
<L>Each &s;ilver va&s;e in my&s;tic order laid.</L>
<L>Fir&s;t, rob'd in white, the Nymph intent adores,</L>
<L>With head uncover'd, the Co&s;metic pow'rs.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="13">A heav'nly image in the gla&s;s appears,</L>
<L>To that &s;he bends, to that her eyes &s;he rears;</L>
<L>Th' inferior Prie&s;te&s;s, at her altar's &s;ide,</L>
<L>Trembling, begins the &s;acred rites of Pride.</L>
<L>Unnumber'd trea&s;ures ope at once, and here</L>
<L>The various off'rings of the world appear;</L>
<L>From each &s;he nicely culls, with curious toil,</L>
<L>And decks the Godde&s;s with the glitt'ring &s;poil.</L>
<L>This ca&s;ket, India's glowing gems unlocks,</L>
<L>And all Arabia breathes from yonder box.</L>
<L>The Tortoi&s;e here and Elephant unite,</L>
<L>Transform'd to combs, the &s;peckled and the white.</L>
<L>Here files of pins extend their &s;hining rows,</L>
<L>Puffs, Powders, Patches, Bibles, Billet-doux.</L>
<L>Now awful beauty puts on all its arms;</L>
<L>The fair each moment ri&s;es in her charms,</L>
<L>Repairs her &s;miles, awakens every grace,</L>
<L>And calls forth all the wonders of her face:</L>
<L>Sees by degrees a purer blu&s;h ari&s;e,</L>
<L>And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes.</L>
<L>The bu&s;y Sylphs &s;urround their darling care,</L>

<L>Some fold the &s;leeve, whil&s;t others plait the gown;</L>

<L>Not with more glories, in th' etherial plain,</L>

<L>Than, i&s;&s;uing forth, the rival of his beams</L>
<L>Launch'd on the bo&s;om of the &s;ilver'd Thames.</L>
<L>Fair Nymphs, and well-dre&s;s'd Youths, around her &s;hone,</L>
<L>But ev'ry eye was fix'd on her alone.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="14">On her white brea&s;t a &s;parkling Cro&s;s &s;he wore,</L>

<L>Bright as the &s;un, her eyes the gazers &s;trike,</L>

<L>For when &s;ucce&s;s a lover's toil attends,</L>
<L>Few a&s;k, if fraud or force attain'd his ends.</L>

<L>From youth to age a rev'rend Hermit grew;</L>
<L>The mo&s;s his bed, the cave his humble cell,</L>
<L>His food the fruits, his drink the cry&s;tal well:</L>
<L>Remote from man, with God he pa&s;s'd the days,</L>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>The &s;everity of this &s;atire, and the excellence of its ver&s;ification, give it a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank in this &s;pecies of compo&s;ition. At pre&s;ent, an ordinary reader would &s;carce &s;uppo&s;e that Shadwell, who is here meant by Mac Flecknoe, was worth being cha&s;ti&s;ed, and that Dryden's de&s;cending to &s;uch game was like an eagle's &s;tooping to catch flies. The truth, however, is, Shadwell, at one time, held divided reputation with this great poet. Every age produces its fa&s;hionable dunces, who, by following the tran&s;ient topic, or humour, of the day, &s;upply talkative ignorance with materials for conver&s;ation.</P>

<HEAD>ON POETRY. A RHAPSODY.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>Here follows one of the be&s;t ver&s;ified poems in our language, and the mo&s;t ma&s;terly produc|tion of its author. The &s;everity with which Walpole is here treated, was in con&s;equence of that mini&s;ter's having refu&s;ed to provide for Swift in England, when applied to for that purpo&s;e in the year 1725 (if I remember right). The &s;e|verity of a poet, however, gave Walpole very little unea&s;ine&s;s. A man who&s;e &s;chemes, like this mini&s;ter's, &s;eldom extended beyond the exi|gency of the year, but little regarded the con|tempt of po&s;terity.</P>
