<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following E&s;&s;ays have already appeared at different times, and in different publications. The pamphlets in which they were in&s;erted being generally un&s;ucce&s;sful, the&s;e &s;hared the common &s;ate, with|out a&s;&s;i&s;ting the book&s;eller's aims, or extending the writer's reputation. The public was too &s;trenuou&s;ly em|ployed with their own follies, to be a&s;&s;iduous in e&s;timating mine; &s;o that many of my be&s;t attempts in this
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
way, have fallen victims to the tran|&s;ient topic of the times; the Gho&s;t in Cock Lane, or the &s;iege of Ti|conderago.</P>
<P>But though they have pa&s;t pretty &s;ilently into the world, I can by no means complain of their circulation. The magazines and papers of the day, have, indeed, been liberal enough in this re&s;pect. Mo&s;t of the&s;e e&s;&s;ays have been regularly re|printed twice or thrice a year, and conveyed to the public through the kennel of &s;ome engaging compilation. If there be a pride in multiplied edi|tions, I have &s;een &s;ome of my labours &s;ixteen times reprinted, and claimed by different parents as their own. I have &s;een them flouri&s;hed at the beginning with prai&s;e, and &s;igned at the end with the names of Philan|tos,
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
Philalethes, Philalutheros, and Philanthropos. The&s;e gentlemen have kindly &s;tood &s;pon&s;ors to my pro|ductions, and to flatter me more, have always pa&s;t them as their own.</P>
<P>It is time, however, at la&s;t, to vindicate my claims; and as the&s;e entertainers of the public, as they call them&s;elves, have partly lived upon me for &s;ome years, let me now try if I cannot live a little upon my&s;elf. I would de&s;ire in this ca&s;e, to imitate that fat man who I have &s;omewhere heard of in a &s;hipwreck, who, when the &s;ailors pre&s;t by famine, were taking &s;lices from his po&s;teriors, to &s;atisfy tkeir hunger, in&s;i&s;ted with great ju&s;tice, on having the fir&s;t cut for him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="6">Yet after all, I cannot be angry with any who have taken it into their heads, to think that whatever I write is worth reprinting, particularly when I con&s;ider how great a majo|rity will think it &s;carce worth reading. Trifling and &s;uperficial are terms of reproach that are ea&s;ily objected, and that carry an air of penetration in the ob&s;erver. The&s;e faults have been objected to the following e&s;&s;ays; and it mu&s;t be owned, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, that the charge is true. However, I could have made them more meta|phy&s;ical had I thought fit, but I would a&s;k whether in a &s;hort e&s;&s;ay it is not nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;uperficial? Before we have prepared to enter into the depths of a &s;ubject, in the u&s;ual forms, we have got to the bottom of our &s;canty page, and thus lo&s;e the
<PB N="v" REF="7">
honours of a victory by too tedious a preparation for the combat.</P>
<P>There is another fault in this col|lection of trifles, which I fear, will not be &s;o ea&s;ily pardoned. It will be alledged that the humour of them, (if any be found) is &s;tale and hack|neyed. This may be true enough as matters now &s;tand, but I may with great truth a&s;&s;ert, that the humour was new when I wrote it. Since that time indeed, many of the topics which were fir&s;t &s;tarted here, have been hunted down, and many of the thoughts blown upon. In fact, the&s;e E&s;&s;ays were con&s;idered as quietly laid in the grave of oblivion, and our modern compilers, like &s;extons and executioners, think it their undoubt|ed right to pillage the dead.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="8">However, whatever right I have to complain of the public, they can, as yet have no ju&s;t rea&s;on to com|plain of me. If I have written dull E&s;&s;ays, they have hitherto treated them as dull E&s;&s;ays. Thus far we are at lea&s;t, upon par, and until they think fit to make me their humble debtor, by prai&s;e, I am re&s;olved not to lo&s;e a &s;ingle inch of my &s;elf impor|tance. In&s;tead, therefore, of attempt|ing to e&s;tabli&s;h a credit among&s;t them, it will perhaps be wi&s;er to apply to &s;ome more di&s;tant corre&s;pondent, and as my drafts are in &s;ome danger of being prote&s;ted at home, it may not be imprudent upon this occa&s;ion, to draw my bills upon Po&s;terity. Mr. Po&s;terity. Sir, Nine hundred and ninety-nine years after &s;ight hereof, pay the bearer, or order, a
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
thou&s;and pound's worth of prai&s;e, free from all deductions what&s;oever, it being a commodity that will then be very &s;erviceable to him, and place it to the accompt of, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY I.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not, perhaps, a more whim&s;ical figure in nature, than a man of real mode&s;ty who a&s;&s;umes an air of impudence; who, while his heart beats with anxiety, &s;tudies ea&s;e and affects good hu|mour. In this &s;ituation, however, every un|experienced writer finds him&s;elf. Impre&s;&s;ed with the terrors of the tribunal before which he is going to appear, his natural humour turns to pertne&s;s, and for real wit he is obliged to &s;ub|&s;titute vivacity.</P>
<P>FOR my part, as I was never di&s;tingui&s;hed for addre&s;s, and have often even blundered in mak|ing my bow, I am at a lo&s;s whether to be merry or &s;ad on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion. Should I mo|de&s;tly
<PB N="2" REF="11">
decline all merit, it is too probable the ha&s;ty reader may take me at my word. If, on the other hand, like labourers in the Magazine trade, I humbly pre&s;ume to promi&s;e an epitome of all the good things that were ever &s;aid or written, tho&s;e readers I mo&s;t de&s;ire to plea&s;e may for&s;ake me.</P>
<P>MY book&s;eller, in this dilemma perceiving my embarra&s;ment, in&s;tantly offered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You mu&s;t know, &s;ir," &s;ays he, "that the republic of letters is at pre&s;ent di|vided into &s;everal cla&s;&s;es. One writer excels at a plan, or a title-page; another works away the body of the book; and a third is a dab at an index. Thus a Magazine is not the re&s;ult of any &s;ingle man's indu&s;try; but goes through as many hands as a new pin, before it is fit for the public. I fancy, &s;ir, continues he, ;I can provide an eminent hand, and upon moderate terms, to draw up a pro|mi&s;ing plan to &s;mooth up our readers a little, and pay them, as colonel Chartres paid his &s;eraglio, at the rate of three halfpence in hand, and three &s;hillings more in promi&s;es."</Q></P>
<P>HE was proceeding in his advice, which, however, I thought proper to decline, by a&s;|&s;uring
<PB N="3" REF="12">
him, that, as I intended to pur&s;ue no fixed method, &s;o it was impo&s;&s;ible to form any regular plan; determined never to be tedious, in order to be logical, wherever plea&s;ure pre|&s;ented, I was re&s;olved to follow.</P>
<P>IT will be improper therefore to pall the reader's curio&s;ity by le&s;&s;ening his &s;urprize, or anticipate any plea&s;ure I am able to procure him, by &s;aying what &s;hall come next. Happy could any effort of mine, but repre&s;s one crimi|nal plea&s;ure, or but for a moment fill up an in|terval of anxiety! How gladly would I lead mankind from the vain pro&s;pects of life, to pro&s;pects of innocence and ea&s;e, where every breeze breaths health, and every &s;ound is but the echo of tranquility.</P>
<P>BUT whatever may be the merit of his in|tentions, every writer is now convinced that he mu&s;t be chiefly indebted to good fortune for finding readers willing to allow him any degree of reputation. It has been remarked, that al|mo&s;t every character which has excited either attention or pity, has owed part of its &s;ucce&s;s to merit, and part to an happy concurrence of circum&s;tances in its favour. Had Cae&s;ar or Cromwell exchanged countries, the one might
<PB N="4" REF="13">
have been a &s;erjeant, and the other an exci&s;e|man. So it is with wit, which generally &s;uc|ceeds more from being happily addre&s;&s;ed, than from its native poignancy. A je&s;t calculated to &s;pread at a gaming-table, may be received with perfect indifference &s;hould it happen to drop in a mackrel-boat. We have all &s;een dunces triumph in &s;ome companies, where men of real humour were di&s;regarded, by a general combination in favour of &s;tupidity. To drive the ob&s;ervation as far as it will go, &s;hould the labours of a writer who de&s;igns his performances for readers of a more refined appetite, fall into the hands of a devourer of compilations, what can he expect but contempt and confu&s;ion? If his merits are to be determined by judges who e&s;timate the value of a book from its bulk, or its fronti&s;piece, every rival mu&s;t acquire an ea&s;y &s;uperiority, who with per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence promi&s;es four extraordinary pages of letter-pre&s;s, or three beautiful prints, curiou&s;ly coloured from nature.</P>
<P>THUS then, though I cannot promi&s;e as much entertainment, or as much elegance as others have done, yet the reader may be a&s;&s;ured he &s;hall have as much of both as I can. He &s;hall, at lea&s;t, find me alive while I &s;tudy his enter|tainment;
<PB N="5" REF="14">
for I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure him, I was never yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ecret of writing and &s;leeping.</P>
<P>DURING the cour&s;e of this paper, therefore, all the wit and learning I have, are heartily at his &s;ervice; which if, after &s;o candid a confe&s;|&s;ion he &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding, &s;till find in|tolerably dull, or low, or &s;ad &s;tuff, this I prote&s;t is no more than I know. I have a clear con&s;ci|ence, and am entirely out of the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>YET I would not have him, upon the pe|ru&s;al of a &s;ingle paper, pronounce me incorri|gible; he may try a &s;econd, which, as there is a &s;tudied difference in &s;ubject and &s;tyle, may be more &s;uited to his ta&s;te; if this al&s;o fails, I mu&s;t refer him to a third, or even to a fourth, in ca&s;e of extremity: if he &s;hould &s;till continue refractory, and find me dull to the la&s;t, I mu&s;t inform him, with Bays in the Rehear&s;al, that I think him a very odd kind of a fellow, and de&s;ire no more of his acquaintance. But &s;till if my readers impute the general tenour of my &s;ubject to me as a fault, I mu&s;t beg leave to tell them a &s;tory.</P>
<P>A TRAVELLER, in his way to Italy, found him&s;elf in a country where the inhabitants had
<PB N="6" REF="15">
each a large excre&s;ence depending from the chin; a deformity which, as it was endemic, and the people little u&s;ed to &s;trangers, it had been the cu&s;tom, time immemorial, to look up|on as the greate&s;t beauty. Ladies grew toa&s;ts from the &s;ize of their chins, and no men were beaux who&s;e faces were not broade&s;t at the bot|tom. It was Sunday, a country church was at hand, and our traveller was willing to per|form the duties of the day. Upon his fir&s;t ap|pearance at the church-door, the eyes of all were naturally fixed upon the &s;tranger; but what was their amazement, when they found that he actually wanted that emblem of beauty, a pur&s;ed chin. Stifled bur&s;ts of laughter, winks, and whi&s;pers, circulated from vi&s;age to vi&s;age; the pri&s;matic figure of the &s;tranger's face was a fund of infinite gaiety Our traveller could no longer patiently continue an object for defor|mity to point at. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good folks," &s;aid he, "I perceive that I am a very ridiculous figure here, but I a&s;&s;ure you am reckoned no way deformed at HOME.</Q></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY II. THE STORY OF <HI>ALCANDER and SEPTIMIUS.</HI> Taken from a Byzantine Hi&s;torian.</HEAD>
<P>ATHENS, long after the decline of the Roman empire, &s;till continued the &s;eat of learning, politene&s;s, and wi&s;dom. Theodoric, the O&s;trogoth, repaired the &s;chools which bar|barity was &s;uffering to fall into decay, and con|tinued tho&s;e pen&s;ions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had monopolized.</P>
<P>IN this city, and about this period, Alcander and Septimius were fellow-&s;tudents together. The one, the mo&s;t &s;ubtle rea&s;oner of all the Lyceum; the other, the mo&s;t eloquent &s;peaker in the academic grove. Mutual admiration &s;oon begot a friend&s;hip. Their fortunes were nearly equal, and they were natives of the two mo&s;t celebrated cities in the world; for Alcander was of Athens, Septimius came from Rome.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="17">IN this &s;tate of harmony they lived for &s;ome time together, when Alcander, after pa&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t part of his youth in the indolence of philo|&s;ophy, thought at length of entering into the bu&s;y world; and, as a &s;tep previous to this, placed his affections on Hypatia, a lady of ex|qui&s;ite beauty. The day of their intended nup|tials was fixed; the previous ceremonies were performed; and nothing now remained but her being conducted in triumph to the apartment of the intended bridegroom.</P>
<P>ALCANDER's exultation in his own happi|ne&s;s, or being unable to enjoy any &s;atisfaction without making his friend Septimius a partner, prevailed upon him to introduce Hypatia to his fellow-&s;tudent; which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found him&s;elf equally happy in friend&s;hip and love. But this was an interview fatal to the future peace of both; for Septimius no &s;ooner &s;aw her, but he was &s;mitten with an involuntary pa&s;&s;ion; and, though he u&s;ed every effort to &s;uppre&s;s de&s;ires at once &s;o imprudent and unju&s;t, the emotions of his mind in a &s;hort time became &s;o &s;trong, that they brought on a fever, which the phy&s;icians judged incura|ble.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="18">DURING this illne&s;s, Alcander watched him with all the anxiety of fondne&s;s, and brought his mi&s;tre&s;s to join in tho&s;e amiable offices of friend&s;hip. The &s;agacity of the phy&s;icians, by the&s;e means, &s;oon di&s;covered that the cau&s;e of their patient's di&s;order was love; and Alcander being apprized of their di&s;covery, at length extorted a confe&s;&s;ion from the reluctant dying lover.</P>
<P>IT would but delay the narrative to de&s;cribe the conflict between love and friend&s;hip in the brea&s;t of Alcander on this occa&s;ion; it is enough to &s;ay, that the Athenians were at that time ar|rived at &s;uch refinement in morals, that every virtue was carried to exce&s;s. In &s;hort, forget|ful of his own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her charms, to the young Roman. They were married privately by his connivance, and this unlooked-for change of fortune wrought as unexpected a change in the con&s;titution of the now happy Septimius. In a few days he was perfectly recovered, and &s;et out with his fair partner for Rome. Here, by an exertion of tho&s;e talents which he was &s;o eminently po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of, Septimius, in a few years, arrived at the highe&s;t dignities of the &s;tate, and was con|&s;tituted the city-judge, or praetor.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="19">IN the mean time Alcander not only felt the pain of being &s;eparated from his friend and his mi&s;tre&s;s, but a pro&s;ecution was al&s;o commenced again&s;t him by the relations of Hypatia, for having ba&s;ely given up his bride, as was &s;ug|ge&s;ted, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, and even his eloquence in his own defence, were not able to with&s;tand the influence of a powerful party. He was ca&s;t and condemned to pay an enormous fine. However, being unable to rai&s;e &s;o large a &s;um at the time appointed, his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were confi&s;cated, he him&s;elf was &s;tripped of the habit of freedom, ex|po&s;ed as a &s;lave in the market-place, and &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder.</P>
<P>A MERCHANT of Thrace becoming his pur|cha&s;er, Alcander, with &s;ome other companions of di&s;tre&s;s, was carried into that region of de&s;o|lation and &s;terility. His &s;tated employment was to follow the herds of an imperious ma&s;ter, and his &s;ucce&s;s in hunting was all that was allowed him to &s;upply his precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of &s;ea&s;on &s;erved but to aggravate his un&s;heltered di&s;tre&s;s. After &s;ome years of bondage, however, an opportunity of e&s;caping offered; he embraced it with ardour;
<PB N="11" REF="20">
&s;o that travelling by night, and lodging in ca|verns by day, to &s;horten a long &s;tory, he at la&s;t arrived in Rome. The &s;ame day on which Alcander arrived, Septimius &s;ate admini&s;tering ju&s;tice in the forum, whither our wanderer came expecting to be in&s;tantly known, and publicly acknowledged, by his former friend. Here he &s;tood the whole day among&s;t the crowd, watch|ing the eyes of the judge, and expecting to be taken notice of; but he was &s;o much altered by a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hard&s;hips, that he conti|nued unnoted among the re&s;t; and, in the eve|ning, when he was going up to the praetor's chair he was brutally repul&s;ed by the attending lictors. The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another; for night coming on, he now found him&s;elf un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking a place to lie in, and yet knew not where to apply. All emaciated, and in rags as he was, none of the citizens would harbour &s;o much wretchedne&s;s; and &s;leeping in the &s;treets might be attended with interruption or danger: in &s;hort, he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs without the city, the u&s;ual retreat of guilt, po|verty and de&s;pair. In this man&s;ion of horror, laying his head upon an inverted urn, he forgot his mi&s;eries for a while in &s;leep; and found, on
<PB N="12" REF="21">
his flinty couch, more ea&s;e than beds of down can &s;upply to the guilty.</P>
<P>AS he continued here, about midnight, two robbers came to make this their retreat; but happening to di&s;agree about the divi&s;ion of their plunder, one of them &s;tabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the entrance. In the&s;e circum&s;tances he was found next morning dead at the mouth of the vault. This naturally inducing a further enquiry, an alarm was &s;pread; the cave was examined; and Alcander being found was immediately appre|hended and accu&s;ed of robbery and murder. The circum&s;tances again&s;t him were &s;trong, and the wretchedne&s;s of his appearance confirmed &s;u&s;|picion. Misfortune and he were now &s;o long acquainted, that he at la&s;t became regardle&s;s of life. He dete&s;ted a world where he had found only ingratitude, fal&s;hood and cruelty; he was determined to make no defence; and, thus low|ering with re&s;olution, he was dragged, bound with cords, before the tribunal of Septimius. As the proofs were po&s;itive again&s;t him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication, the judge was proceeding to doom him to a mo&s;t cruel and ignominious death, when the atten|tion of the multitude was &s;oon divided by ano|ther
<PB N="13" REF="22">
object. The robber, who had been really guilty, was apprehended &s;elling his plunder, and, &s;truck with a panic, had confe&s;&s;ed his crime. He was brought bound to the &s;ame tri|bunal, and acquitted every other per&s;on of any partner&s;hip in his guilt. Alcander's innocence therefore appeared, but the &s;ullen ra&s;hne&s;s of his conduct remained a wonder to the &s;urrounding multitude; but their a&s;toni&s;hment was &s;till far|ther encrea&s;ed when they &s;aw their judge &s;tart from his tribunal to embrace the &s;uppo&s;ed cri|minal: Septimius recollected his friend and for|mer benefactor, and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and of joy. Need the &s;equel be related? Alcander was acquitted; &s;hared the friend&s;hip and honours of the principal citizens of Rome; lived afterwards in happine&s;s and ea&s;e; and left it to be engraved on his tomb, That no circum&s;tances are &s;o de&s;perate, which Providence may not relieve.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY III.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I reflect on the unambitious re|tirement in which I pa&s;&s;ed the earlier part of my life in the country, I cannot avoid feeling &s;ome pain in thinking that tho&s;e happy days are never to return. In that retreat all na|ture &s;eemed capable of affording plea&s;ure; I then made no refinements on happine&s;s, but could be plea&s;ed with the mo&s;t aukward ef|forts of ru&s;tic mirth, thought cro&s;s-purpo&s;es the highe&s;t &s;tretch of human wit, and que&s;tions and commands the mo&s;t rational way of &s;pend|ing the evening. Happy could &s;o charming an illu&s;ion &s;till continue. I find that age and know|ledge only contribute to &s;our our di&s;po&s;itions. My pre&s;ent enjoyments may be more refined, but they are infinitely le&s;s plea&s;ing. The plea|&s;ure the be&s;t actor gives, can no way compare to that I have received from a country wag who imitated a quaker's &s;ermon. The mu&s;ic of the fine&s;t &s;inger is di&s;&s;onance to what I felt when our old dairy-maid &s;ung me into tears with Johnny Arm&s;trong's La&s;t Good Night, or the Cruelty of Barbara Allen.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="24">WRITERS of every age have endeavoured to &s;hew that plea&s;ure is in us, and not in the objects offered for our amu&s;ement. If the &s;oul be happily di&s;po&s;ed, every thing becomes capa|ble of affording entertaintment, and di&s;tre&s;s will almo&s;t want a name. Every occcurrence pa&s;&s;es in review like the figures of a proce&s;&s;ion; &s;ome may be aukward, others ill dre&s;&s;ed; but none but a fool is for this enraged with the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER to have once &s;een a &s;lave in a fortification in Flanders, who appeared no way touched with his &s;ituation. He was maim|ed, deformed, and chained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day till night-fall, and condemned to this for life; yet, with all the&s;e circum&s;tances of apparent wretchedne&s;s, he &s;ung, would have danced but that he wanted a leg, and appeared the merrie&s;t, happie&s;t man of all the garri&s;on. What a practical philo&s;o|pher was here; an happy con&s;titution &s;upplied philo&s;ophy; and, though &s;eemingly de&s;titute of wi&s;dom, he was really wi&s;e. No reading or &s;tudy had contributed to di&s;enchant the fairy|land around him. Every thing furni&s;hed him with an opportunity of mirth; and, tho' &s;ome thought him, from his in&s;en&s;ibility, a fool, he
<PB N="16" REF="25">
was &s;uch an ideot as philo&s;ophers &s;hould wi&s;h to imitate; for all philo&s;ophy is only forcing the trade of happine&s;s, when nature &s;eems to deny the means.</P>
<P>THEY who, like our &s;lave, can place them|&s;elves on that &s;ide of the world in which every thing appears in a plea&s;ing light, will find &s;ome|thing in every occurrence to excite their good humour. The mo&s;t calamitous events, either to them&s;elves or others, can bring no new af|fliction; the whole world is to them a theatre, on which comedies only are acted.

<P>OF all the men I ever read of, the famous cardinal de Retz po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this happine&s;s of tem|per in the highe&s;t degree. As he was a man of gallantry, and de&s;pi&s;ed all that wore the pedan|tic appearance of philo&s;ophy, wherever plea&s;ure was to be &s;old, he was generally foremo&s;t to rai&s;e the auction. Being an univer&s;al admirer
<PB N="17" REF="26">
of the fair &s;ex, when he found one lady cruel, he generally fell in love with another, from whom he expected a more favourable reception: if &s;he too rejected his addre&s;&s;es, he never thought of retiring into de&s;arts, or pining in hopele&s;s di&s;tre&s;s. He per&s;uaded him&s;elf, that, in&s;tead of loving the lady, he only fancied that he had loved her, and &s;o all was well again. When fortune wore her angrie&s;t look, and he at la&s;t fell into the power of his mo&s;t deadly enemy cardinal Mazarine (being confined a clo&s;e pri|&s;oner in the ca&s;tle of Valenciennes) he never attempted to &s;upport his di&s;tre&s;s by wi&s;dom or philo&s;ophy, for he pretended to neither. He only laughed at him&s;elf and his per&s;ecutor, and &s;eemed infinitely plea&s;ed at his new &s;ituation. In this man&s;ion of di&s;tre&s;s, though &s;ecluded from his friends, though denied all the amu&s;ements, and even the conveniencies of life, he &s;till re|tained his good humour; laughed at all the lit|tle &s;pite of his enemies; and carried the je&s;t &s;o far as to be revenged, by writing the life of his gaoler.</P>

It matters not whether our good hu|mour be con&s;trued by others into in&s;en&s;ibility, or even ideoti&s;m; it is happine&s;s to our&s;elves, and none but a fool would mea&s;ure his &s;atisfac|tion by what the world thinks of it: for my own part, I never pa&s;s by one of our pri&s;ons for debt, that I do not envy that felicity which is &s;till going forward among tho&s;e people who for|get the cares of the world by being &s;hut out from its ambition.</P>
<P>THE happie&s;t &s;illy fellow I ever knew, was of the number of tho&s;e good-natured creatures that are &s;aid to do no harm to any but them|&s;elves. When ever he fell into any mi&s;ery, he u&s;ually called it Seeing Life. If his head was broke by a chairman, or his pocket picked by a &s;harper, he comforted him&s;elf by imitating the Hibernian dialect of the one, or the more fa|&s;hionable cant of the other. Nothing came ami&s;s to him. His inattention to money mat|ters had incen&s;ed his father to &s;uch a degree, that all the interce&s;&s;ion of friends in his favour was fruitle&s;s. The old gentleman was on his death-bed. The whole family, and Dick among the number, gathered around him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I leave my &s;econd &s;on, Andrew, &s;aid the ex|piring mi&s;er, my whole e&s;tate, and de&s;ire him

<HEAD>ESSAY IV.</HEAD>
<P>I REMEMBER to have read in &s;ome philo&s;o|pher (I believe in Tom Brown's works) that, let a man's character, &s;entiments, or com|plexion, be what they will, he can find com|pany in London to match them. If he be &s;ple|netic, he may every day meet companions on the &s;eats in St. James's Park, with who&s;e groans he may mix his own, and pathetically talk of the weather. If he be pa&s;&s;ionate, he may vent his rage among the old orators at Slaughter's coffee-hou&s;e, and damn the nation becau&s;e it keeps him from &s;tarving. If he be phlegmatic, he may &s;it in &s;ilence at the hum-drum club in Ivy-Lane; and, if actually mad, he may find very good company in Moor-fields, either at Bedlam or the Foundery, ready to cultivate a nearer acquaintance.</P>
<P>BUT, although &s;uch as have a knowledge of the town, may ea&s;ily cla&s;s them&s;elves with tem|pers congenial to their own; a countryman who comes to live in Londom finds nothing more difficult. With regard to my&s;elf, none

ever tried with more a&s;&s;iduity, or came off with &s;uch indifferent &s;ucce&s;s. I &s;pent a whole &s;ea&s;on in the &s;earch, during which time my name has been inrolled in &s;ocieties, lodges, convocations, and meetings without number. To &s;ome I was introduced by a friend, to others invited by an adverti&s;ement; to the&s;e I introduced my&s;elf, and to tho&s;e I changed my name to gain admit|tance. In &s;hort, no coquette was ever more &s;ol|licitous to match her ribbons to her complexion, than I to &s;uit my club to my temper, for I was too ob&s;tinate to bring my temper to conform to it.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t club I entered upon coming to town, was that of the Choice Spirits. The name was entirely &s;uited to my ta&s;te; I was a lover of mirth, good-humour, and even &s;ome|times of fun, from my childhood.</P>
<P>AS no other pa&s;&s;port was requi&s;ite but the payment of two &s;hillings at the door, I intro|duced my&s;elf without farther ceremony to the members, who were already a&s;&s;embled, and had, for &s;ome time, begun upon bu&s;ine&s;s. The Grand, with a mallet in his hand, pre&s;ided at the head of the table. I could not avoid, upon my entrance, making u&s;e of all my &s;kill in phy|&s;iognomy,
<PB N="23" REF="32">
in order to di&s;cover that &s;uperiority of genius in men, who had taken a title &s;o &s;u|perior to the re&s;t of mankind. I expected to &s;ee the lines of every face marked with &s;trong think|ing; but, though I had &s;ome &s;kill in this &s;ci|ence, I could for my life di&s;cover nothing but a pert &s;imper, fat, or profound &s;tupidity.</P>
<P>MY &s;peculations were &s;oon interrupted by the Grand, who had knocked down Mr. Sprig|gins for a &s;ong. I was, upon this, whi&s;pered by one of the company who &s;at next me, that I &s;hould now &s;ee &s;omething touched off to a nicety, for Mr. Spriggins was going to give us Mad Tom in all its glory. Mr. Spriggins en|deavoured to excu&s;e him&s;elf; for, as he was to act a madman and a king, it was impo&s;&s;ible to go through the part properly without a crown and chains. His excu&s;es were over-ruled by a great majority, and with much vociferation. The pre&s;ident ordered up the jack-chain, and, in&s;tead of a crown, our performer covered his brows with an inverted jordan. After he had rattled his chain, and &s;hook his head, to the great delight of the whole company, he began his &s;ong. As I have heard few young fellows offer to &s;ing in company that did not expo&s;e them&s;elves, it was no great di&s;appointment to
<PB N="24" REF="33">
me to find Mr. Spriggins among the number; however, not to &s;eem an odd fi&s;h, I ro&s;e from my &s;eat in rapture, cried out, Bravo! Encore! and &s;lapped the table as loud as any of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>THE gentleman who &s;at next me &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed with my ta&s;te and the ardour of my approbation; and whi&s;pering told me that I had &s;uffered an immmen&s;e lo&s;s; for, had I come a few minutes &s;ooner, I might have heard Gee ho Dobbin &s;ung in a tip-top manner by the pimple-no&s;ed &s;pirit at the pre&s;ident's right el|bow: but he was evaporated before I came.</P>
<P>AS I was expre&s;&s;ing my unea&s;ine&s;s at this di&s;|appointment, I found the attention of the com|pany employed upon a fat figure, who, with a voice more rough than the Stafford&s;hire giant's, was giving us, The Softly Sweet, in Lydian Mea&s;ure, of Alexander's Fea&s;t. After a &s;hort pau&s;e of admiration, to this &s;ucceeded a Welch dialogue, with the humours of Teague and Taffy: after that, came on Old Jack&s;on, with a &s;tory between every &s;tanza: next was &s;ung the Du&s;t-cart, and then Solomon's Song. The gla&s;s began now to circulate pretty freely; tho&s;e who were &s;ilent when &s;ober, would now be

heard in their turn; every man had his &s;ong, and he &s;aw no rea&s;on why he &s;hould not be heard as well as any of the re&s;t: one begged to be heard while he gave Death and the Lady in high ta&s;te; another &s;ung to a plate which he kept trund|ling on the edges; nothing was now heard but &s;inging; voice ro&s;e above voice, and the whole became one univer&s;al &s;hout, when the landlord came to acquaint the company that the reckon|ing was drank out. Rabelais calls the moments in which a reckoning is mentioned, the mo&s;t melancholy of our lives: never was &s;o much noi&s;e &s;o quickly quelled, as by this &s;hort but pathetic oration of our landlord: Drank out was ecchoed in a tone of di&s;content round the table: Drank out already! that was very odd! that &s;o much punch could be drank out already: impo&s;&s;ible! The landlord, however, &s;eeming re&s;olved not to retreat from his fir&s;t a&s;&s;urances, the company was di&s;&s;olved, and a pre&s;ident cho&s;en for the night en&s;uing.</P>
<P>A FRIEND of mine, to whom I was com|plaining &s;ome time after of the entertainment I have been de&s;cribing, propo&s;ed to bring me to the club that he frequented; which, he fancied would &s;uit the gravity of my temper exactly. "We have, at the Muzzy Club,"
<PB N="26" REF="35">
&s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"no riotous mirth nor aukward ribal|dry; no confu&s;ion or bawling; all is con|ducted with wi&s;dom and decency: be&s;ides, &s;ome of our members are worth forty thou|&s;and pounds; men of prudence and fore&s;ight every one of them: the&s;e are the proper ac|quaintance, and to &s;uch I will to-night in|troduce you."</Q> I was charmed at the propo|&s;al: to be acquainted with men worth forty thou&s;and pounds, and to talk wi&s;dom the whole night, were offers that threw me into rap|ture.</P>
<P>AT &s;even o'clock I was accordingly intro|duced by my friend, not indeed to the company; for, though I made my be&s;t bow, they &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible of my approach, but to the table at which they were &s;itting. Upon my entering the room, I could not avoid feeling a &s;ecret ve|neration from the &s;olemnity of the &s;cene before me; the members kept a profound &s;ilence, each with a pipe in his mouth and a pewter pot in his hand, and with faces that might ea&s;ily be con&s;trued into ab&s;olute wi&s;dom. Happy &s;ociety, thought I to my&s;elf, where the members think before they &s;peak, deliver nothing ra&s;hly, but convey their thoughts to each other pregnant with meaning, and matured by reflection.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="36">IN this plea&s;ing &s;peculation I continued a full half hour, expecting each moment that &s;ome body would begin to open his mouth; every time the pipe was laid down I expected it was to &s;peak; but it was only to &s;pit. At length, re&s;olving to break the charm my&s;elf, and overcome their extreme diffidence, for to this I imputed their &s;ilence; I rubbed my hands, and, looking as wi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, ob&s;erved that the nights began to grow a little cooli&s;h at this time of the year. This, as it was directed to none of the company in particular, none thought him&s;elf obliged to an&s;wer; wherefore I conti|nued &s;till to rub my hands and look wi&s;e. My next effort was addre&s;&s;ed to a gentleman who &s;at next me; to whom I ob&s;erved, that the beer was extreme good: my neighbour made no reply, but by a large puff of tobacco-&s;moak.</P>
<P>I NOW began to he unea&s;y in this dumb &s;o|ciety, till one of them a little relieved me by ob&s;erving, that bread had not ri&s;en the&s;e three weeks: "Ay," &s;ays another, &s;till keeping the pipe in his mouth, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that puts me in mind of a plea&s;ant &s;tory about that&mdash;hem&mdash;very well; you mu&s;t know&mdash;but, before I begin&mdash;Sir, my &s;ervice to you&mdash;where was I?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="37">MY next club goes by the name of the Har|monical Society; probably from that love of order and friend&s;hip which every per&s;on com|mends in in&s;titutions of this nature. The landlord was him&s;elf founder. The money &s;pent is four pence each; and they &s;ometimes whip for a double reckoning. To this club few recommendations are requi&s;ite, except the introductory four pence and my landlord's good word, which, as he gains by it, he never refu&s;es.</P>
<P>WE all here talked and behaved as every body el&s;e u&s;ually does on his club-night; we di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the topick of the day, drank each others healths, &s;nuffed the candles with our fingers, and filled our pipes from the &s;ame plate of tobacco. The company &s;aluted each other in the common manner. Mr. Bellows-mender hoped Mr. Curry-comb-maker had not caught cold going home the la&s;t club-night; and he returned the compliment by hoping that young Ma&s;ter Bellows-mender had got well again of the chin-cough. Doctor Twi&s;t told us a &s;tory of a parliament-man with whom he was inti|mately acquainted; while the bug-man, at the &s;ame time, was telling a better &s;tory of a no|ble lord with whom he could do any thing. A gentleman in a black wig and leather breeches,
<PB N="29" REF="38">
at t'other end of the table, was engaged in a long narrative of the Gho&s;t in Cock-lane: he had read it in the papers of the day, and was telling it to &s;ome that &s;at next him, who could not read. Near him Mr. Dibbins was di&s;puting on the old &s;ubject of religion with a Jew ped|lar, over the table, while the pre&s;ident vainly knocked down Mr. Leather&s;ides for a &s;ong. Be&s;ides the combinations of the&s;e voices, which I could hear altogether, and which formed an upper part to the concert, there were &s;everal others playing under parts by them&s;elves, and endeavouring to fa&s;ten on &s;ome luckle&s;s neigh|bour's ear, who was him&s;elf bent upon the &s;ame de&s;ign again&s;t &s;ome other.</P>
<P>WE have often heard of the &s;peech of a cor|poration, and this induced me to tran&s;cribe a &s;peech of this club, taken in &s;hort-hand, word for word, as it was &s;poken by every member of the company. It may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the man who told of the gho&s;t had the loude&s;t voice, and the longe&s;t &s;tory to tell, &s;o that his continuing narrative filled every cha&s;m in the conver&s;ation.</P>

<P>WERE I to be angry at men for being fools, I could here find ample room for declamation; but, alas! I have been a fool my&s;elf; and why &s;hould I be angry with them for being fomething &s;o natural to every child of humanity?</P>
<P>FATIGUED with this &s;ociety, I was intro|duced, the following night, to a club of fa&s;hion. On taking my place, I found the conver&s;ation &s;ufficiently ea&s;y, and tolerably good-natured; for my lord and Sir Paul were not yet arrived. I now thought my&s;elf completely fitted, and re|&s;olving to &s;eek no farther, determined to take up my re&s;idence here for the winter; while my temper began to open in&s;en&s;ibly to the chear|fulne&s;s I &s;aw diffu&s;ed on every face in the room: but the delu&s;ion &s;oon vani&s;hed, when the waiter came to apprize us that his lord&s;hip and Sir Paul were ju&s;t arrived.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="41">FROM this moment all our felicity was at an end; our new gue&s;ts bu&s;tled into the room, and took their &s;eats at the head of the table. Adieu now all confidence; every creature &s;trove who &s;hould mo&s;t recommend him&s;elf to our members of di&s;tinction. Each &s;eemed quite regardle&s;s of plea&s;ing any but our new gue&s;ts; and, what before wore the appearance of friend|&s;hip, was now turned into rivalry.</P>
<P>YET I could not ob&s;erve that, amid&s;t all this flattery and ob&s;equious attention, our great men took any notice of the re&s;t of the com|pany. Their whole di&s;cour&s;e was addre&s;&s;ed to each other. Sir Paul told his lord&s;hip a long &s;tory of Moravia the Jew; and his lord&s;hip gave Sir Paul a very long account of his new method of managing &s;ilk-worms: he led him, and con&s;equently the re&s;t of the company, through all the &s;tages of feeding, &s;unning, and hatching; with an epi&s;ode on mulberry-trees, a digre&s;&s;ion upon gra&s;s &s;eeds, and a long paren|the&s;is about his new po&s;tilion. In this manner we travelled on, wi&s;hing every &s;tory to be the la&s;t; but all in vain;
<Q>"Hills over hills, and Alps on Alps aro&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="42">THE la&s;t club in which I was inrolled a member, was a &s;ociety of moral philo&s;ophers, as they called them&s;elves, who a&s;&s;embled twice a week, in order to &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of the pre&s;ent mode of religion, and e&s;tabli&s;h a new one in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>I FOUND the members very warmly di&s;pute|ing when I arrived; not indeed about religion or ethics, but about who had neglected to lay down his preliminary &s;ix-pence upon entering the room. The pre&s;ident &s;wore that he had laid his own down, and &s;o &s;wore all the company.</P>
<P>DURING this conte&s;t, I had an opportunity of ob&s;erving the laws, and al&s;o the members of the &s;ociety. The pre&s;ident, who had been, as I was told, lately a bankrupt, was a tall, pale figure, with a long black wig; the next to him was dre&s;&s;ed in a large white wig, and a black cravat; a third, by the brownne&s;s of his complexion, &s;eemed a native of Jamaica; and a fourth, by his hue, appeared to be a black|&s;mith.

<P>WHEN we reflect on the manner in which mankind generally confer their favours, there ap|pears &s;omething &s;o attractive in riches, that the large heap generally collects from the &s;maller: and the poor find as much plea&s;ure in encrea&s;ing the enormous ma&s;s of the rich, as the mi&s;er, who owns it, &s;ees happine&s;s in its encrea&s;e. Nor is there in this any thing repugnant to the laws of morality. Seneca him&s;elf allows, that, in conferring benefits, the pre&s;ent &s;hould always be &s;uited to the dignity of the receiver. Thus the rich receive large pre&s;ents, and are thanked for accepting them. Men of middling &s;tations are obliged to be content with pre&s;ents &s;ome|thing
<PB N="37" REF="46">
le&s;s; while the beggar, who may be truly &s;aid to want indeed, is well paid if a far|thing rewards his warme&s;t &s;olicitations.</P>
<P>EVERY man who has &s;een the world, and has had his ups and downs in life, as the ex|pre&s;&s;ion is, mu&s;t have frequently experienced the truth of this doctrine; and mu&s;t know, that to have much, or to &s;eem to have it, is the only way to have more. Ovid finely compares a man of broken fortune to a falling column; the lower it &s;inks, the greater weight it is obliged to &s;u&s;tain. Thus, when a man's circum&s;tances are &s;uch that he has no occa&s;ion to borrow, he finds numbers willing to lend him; but, &s;hould his wants be &s;uch that he &s;ues for a trifle, it is two to one whether he may be tru&s;ted with the &s;malle&s;t &s;um. A certain young fellow whom I knew, whenever he had occa&s;ion to a&s;k his friend for a guinea, u&s;ed to prelude his reque&s;t as if he wanted two hundred; and talked &s;o fa|miliarly of large &s;ums, that none could ever think he wanted a &s;mall one. The &s;ame gen|tleman, whenever he wanted credit for a &s;uit of cloaths, always made the propo&s;al in a laced coat; for he found by experience, that, if he appeared &s;habby on the&s;e occa&s;ions, his taylor had taken an oath again&s;t tru&s;ting; or what
<PB N="38" REF="47">
was every whit as bad, his foreman was out of the way, and &s;hould not be at home for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>THERE can be no inducement to reveal our wants, except to find pity, and by this means relief; but before a poor man opens his mind in &s;uch circum&s;tances, he &s;hould fir&s;t con&s;ider whether he is contented to lo&s;e the e&s;teem of the per&s;on he &s;olicits, and whether he is willing to give up friend&s;hip to excite compa&s;&s;ion. Pity and friend&s;hip are pa&s;&s;ions incompatible with each other; and it is impo&s;&s;ible that both can re&s;ide in any brea&s;t, for the &s;malle&s;t &s;pace, without impairing each other. Friend&s;hip is made up of e&s;teem and plea&s;ure; pity is com|po&s;ed of &s;orrow and contempt; the mind may, for &s;ome time, fluctuate between them, but it can never entertain both at once.</P>
<P>IN fact, pity, though it may often relieve, is but, at be&s;t, a &s;hort-lived pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;eldom affords di&s;tre&s;s more than tran&s;itory a&s;&s;i&s;tance: with &s;ome it &s;carce la&s;ts from the fir&s;t impul&s;e till the hand can be put into the pocket; with others, it may continue for twice that &s;pace; and on &s;ome of extraordinary &s;en&s;ibility, I have &s;een it operate for half an hour together: but
<PB N="39" REF="48">
&s;till, la&s;t as it may, it generally produces but beggarly effects; and where, from this motive, we give five farthings; from others, we give pounds: whatever be our feelings from the fir&s;t impul&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s, when the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s &s;o|licits a &s;econd time, we then feel with dimi|ni&s;hed &s;en&s;ibility; and, like the repetition of an eccho, every &s;troke becomes weaker; till, at la&s;t, our &s;en&s;ations lo&s;e all mixture of &s;orrow, and degenerate into downright contempt.</P>
<P>THESE &s;peculations bring to my mind the &s;ate of a very good natured fellow, who is now no more. He was bred in a compting-hou&s;e, and his father dying ju&s;t as he was out of his time, left him an hand&s;ome fortune and many friends to advi&s;e with. The re&s;traint in which my friend had been brought up, had thrown a gloom upon his temper, which &s;ome regarded as prudence; and, from &s;uch con&s;iderations, he had every day repeated offers of friend&s;hip. Such as had money, were ready to offer him their a&s;&s;i&s;tance that way; and they who had daughters, frequently, in the warmth of affec|tion, advi&s;ed him to marry. My friend, how|ever, was in good circum&s;tances; he wanted neither money, friends, nor a wife; and there|fore mode&s;tly declined their propo&s;als.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="49">SOME errors, however, in the management of his affairs, and &s;everal lo&s;&s;es in trade, &s;oon brought him to a different way of thinking; and he at la&s;t con&s;idered, that it was his be&s;t way to let his friends know that their offers were at length acceptable. His fir&s;t addre&s;s was to a &s;crivener, who had formerly made him fre|quent offers of money and friend&s;hip, at a time when, perhaps, he knew tho&s;e offers would have been refu&s;ed. As a man, therefore, con|fident of not being refu&s;ed, he reque&s;ted the u&s;e of an hundred guineas for a few days, as he ju&s;t then had occa&s;ion for money. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And pray, Sir, replied the &s;crivener, "do you want all this money?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Want it, Sir?" &s;ays the other, "If I did not want it I &s;hould not have a&s;ked it."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am &s;orry for that," &s;ays the friend; "for tho&s;e who want money when they borrow, will always want money when they &s;hould come to pay. To &s;ay the truth, Sir, money is money now; and I believe it is all &s;unk in the bottom of the &s;ea, for my part; he that has got a little, is a fool if he does not keep what he has got."</Q></P>
<P>NOT quite di&s;concerted by this refu&s;al, our adventurer was re&s;olved to apply to another, whom he knew was the very be&s;t friend he had
<PB N="41" REF="50">
in the world. The gentleman whom he now addre&s;&s;ed, received his propo&s;al with all the af|fability that could be expected from generous friend&s;hip. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let me &s;ee, you want an hun|dred guineas; and pray, dear Jack, would not fifty an&s;wer?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If you have but fifty to &s;pare, Sir, I mu&s;t be contented."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fifty to &s;pare; I do not &s;ay that, for I believe I have but twenty about me."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then I mu&s;t borrow the other thirty from &s;ome other friend."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And pray," replied the friend, "would it not be the be&s;t way to borrow the whole money from that other friend, and then one note will &s;erve for all you know? You know, my dear Sir, that you need make no ceremony with me at any time; you know I'm your friend; and when you chu&s;e a bit of dinner, or &s;o&mdash;You, Tom, &s;ee the gentleman down. You won't forget to dine with us now and then. Your very humble &s;ervant."</Q></P>
<P>DISTRESSED, but not di&s;couraged, at this treatment, he was at la&s;t re&s;olved to find that a&s;&s;i&s;tance from love, which he could not have from friend&s;hip. A young lady, a di&s;tant re|lation by the mother's &s;ide, had a fortune in her own hands; and, as &s;he had already made all
<PB N="42" REF="51">
the advances that her &s;ex's mode&s;ty would per|mit, he made his propo&s;al with confidence. He &s;oon, however, perceived, That no bankrupt ever found the fair one kind. She had lately fallen deeply in love with another, who had more money, and the whole neighbourhood thought it would be a match.</P>
<P>EVERY day now began to &s;trip my poor friend of his former finery; his cloaths flew, piece by piece, to the pawnbroker's, and he &s;eemed at length equipped in the genuine livery of misfortune. But &s;till he thought him&s;elf &s;e|cure from actual nece&s;&s;ity; the numberle&s;s in|vitations he had received to dine, even after his lo&s;&s;es, were yet unan&s;wered; he was therefore now re&s;olved to accept of a dinner, becau&s;e he wanted one; and in this manner he actually lived among his friends a whole week without being openly affronted. The la&s;t place I &s;aw him in was at a reverend divine's. He had, as he fancied, ju&s;t nicked the time of dinner, for he came in as the cloth was laying. He took a chair without being de&s;ired, and talked for &s;ome time without being attended to. He a&s;&s;ured the company, that nothing procured &s;o good an ap|petite as a walk in the Park, where he had been that morning. He went on, and prai&s;ed the
<PB N="43" REF="52">
figure of the dama&s;k table-cloth; talked of a fea&s;t where he had been the day before, but that the veni&s;on was over-done. But all this procured him no invitation: finding therefore the gentleman of the hou&s;e in&s;en&s;ible to all his fetches, he thought proper, at la&s;t, to retire, and mend his appetite by a &s;econd walk in the Park.</P>
<P>YOU then, O ye beggars of my acquaintance, whether in rags or lace; whether in Kent-&s;treet or the Mall; whether at the Smyrna or St. Giles's, might I be permitted to advi&s;e as a friend, never &s;eem to want the favour which you &s;olicit. Apply to every pa&s;&s;ion but human pity for redre&s;s: you may find permanent relief from vanity, from &s;elf-intere&s;t, or from ava|rice, but from compa&s;&s;ion never. The very eloquence of a poor man is di&s;gu&s;ting; and that mouth which is opened even by wi&s;dom, is &s;eldom expected to clo&s;e without the horrors of a petition.</P>
<P>TO ward off the gripe of poverty, you mu&s;t pretend to be a &s;tranger to her, and &s;he will at lea&s;t u&s;e you with ceremony. If you be caught dining upon a halfpenny porrenger of pea&s;e-&s;oup and potatoes, prai&s;e the whole&s;omne&s;s of your
<PB N="44" REF="53">
frugal repa&s;t. You may ob&s;erve that Dr. Cheyne has pre&s;cribed pea&s;e-broth for the gravel; hint that you are not one of tho&s;e who are always making a deity of your belly. If, again, you are obliged to wear a flim&s;y &s;tuff in the mid&s;t of winter, be the fir&s;t to remark, that &s;tuffs are very much worn at Paris; or, if there be found &s;ome irreparable defects in any part of your equipage, which cannot be concealed by all the arts of &s;itting cro&s;s-legged, coaxing, or dern|ing, &s;ay, that neither you nor Samp&s;on Gideon were ever very fond of dre&s;s. If you be a philo|&s;opher, hint that Plato or Seneca are the taylors you choo&s;e to employ; a&s;&s;ure the company that man ought to be content with a bare covering, &s;ince what now is &s;o much his pride, was for|merly his &s;hame. In &s;hort, however caught, never give out; but a&s;cribe to the frugality of your di&s;po&s;ition what others might be apt to at|tribute to the narrowne&s;s of your circum&s;tances. To be poor, and to &s;eem poor, is a certain me|thod never to ri&s;e: pride in the great is hateful; in the wi&s;e, it is ridiculous; but beggarly pride is a rational vanity which I have been taught to applaud and excu&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY VI.</HEAD>
<P>LYSIPPUS is a man who&s;e greatne&s;s of &s;oul the whole world admires. His ge|nero&s;ity is &s;uch, that it prevents a demand, and &s;aves the receiver the trouble and the confu&s;ion of a reque&s;t. His liberality al&s;o does not oblige more by its greatne&s;s, than by his inimitable grace in giving. Sometimes he even di&s;tributes his bounties to &s;trangers, and has been known to do good offices to tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves his enemies. All the world are unani|mous in the prai&s;e of his genero&s;ity; there is only one &s;ort of people who complain of his conduct. Ly&s;ippus does not pay his debts.</P>
<P>IT is no difficult matter to account for a con|duct &s;o &s;eemingly incompatible with it&s;elf. There is greatne&s;s in being generous, and there is only &s;imple ju&s;tice in his &s;atisfying creditors. Ge|nero&s;ity is the part of a &s;oul rai&s;ed above the vulgar. There is in it &s;omething of what we admire in heroes, and prai&s;e with a degree of rapture. Ju&s;tice, on the contrary, is a mere mechanic virtue, only &s;it for trade&s;men, and
<PB N="46" REF="55">
what is practi&s;ed by every broker in 'Change-alley.</P>
<P>IN paying his debts a man barely does his duty, and it is an action attend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d with no &s;ort of glory. Should Ly&s;ippus &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">isfy his creditors, who would be at the pains of telling it to the world. Genero&s;ity is a virtue of a very differ|ent complexion. It is rai&s;ed above duty, and, from its elevation, attracts the attention and the prai&s;es of us little morta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s below.</P>
<P>IN this manner do men generally rea&s;on up|on ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity. The fir&s;t is de&s;pi&s;ed, though a virtue e&s;&s;ential to the good of &s;ociety, and the other attracts our e&s;teem, which too frequently proceeds from an impetuo&s;ity of temper, rather directed by vanity than rea&s;on. Ly&s;ippus is told that his banker a&s;ks a debt of forty pounds, and that a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed acquaintance petitions for the &s;ame &s;um. He gives it without he&s;itating to the latter, for he demands as a fa|vour what the former requires as a debt.</P>
<P>MANKIND in general are not &s;ufficiently acquainted with the import of the word Ju&s;tice: it is commonly believed to con&s;i&s;t only in a per|formance of tho&s;e duties to which the laws of
<PB N="47" REF="56">
&s;ociety can oblige us. This I allow is &s;ome|times the import of the word, and in this &s;en&s;e ju&s;tice is di&s;tingui&s;hed from equity; but there is a ju&s;tice &s;till more exten&s;ive, and which can be &s;hewn to embrace all the virtues united.</P>
<P>JUSTICE may be defined, that virtue which impels us to give to every per&s;on what is his due. In this extended &s;en&s;e of the word, it comprehends the practice of every virtue which rea&s;on pre&s;cribes, or &s;ociety &s;hould expect. Our duty to our maker, to each other, and to our|&s;elves, are fully an&s;wered, if we give them what we owe them. Thus ju&s;tice, properly &s;peaking, is the only virtue: and all the re&s;t have their origin in it.</P>
<P>THE qualities of candour, fortitude, cha|rity, and genero&s;ity, for in&s;tance, are not in their own nature virtues; and, if ever they de|&s;erve the title, it is owing only to ju&s;tice, which impels and directs them. Without &s;uch a moderator, candour might become indi&s;cre|tion, fortitude ob&s;tinacy, charity imprudence, and genero&s;ity mi&s;taken profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>A DISINTERESTED action, if it be not conducted by ju&s;tice, is, at be&s;t, indifferent
<PB N="48" REF="57">
in its nature, and not unfrequently even turns to vice. The expences of &s;ociety, of pre&s;ents, of entertainments, and the other helps to chear|fulne&s;s, are actions merely indifferent, when not repugnant to a better method of di&s;po&s;ing of our &s;uperfluities; but they become vicious when they ob&s;truct or exhau&s;t our abilities from a more virtuous di&s;po&s;ition of our circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>TRUE genero&s;ity is a duty as indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary as tho&s;e impo&s;ed upon us by law. It is a rule impo&s;ed upon us by rea&s;on, which &s;hould be the &s;overeign law of a rational being. But this genero&s;ity does not con&s;i&s;t in obeying every impul&s;e of humanity, in following blind pa&s;&s;ion for our guide, and impairing our cir|cum&s;tances by pre&s;ent benefactions, &s;o as to render us incapable of future ones.</P>
<P>MISERS are generally characterized as men without honour, or without humanity, who live only to accumulate, and to this pa&s;&s;ion &s;a|crifice every other happine&s;s. They have been de&s;cribed as madmen, who, in the mid&s;t of abundance, bani&s;h every plea&s;ure, and make, from imaginary wants, real nece&s;&s;ities. But few, very few, corre&s;pond to this exaggerated
<PB N="49" REF="58">
picture; and, perhaps, there is not one in whom all the&s;e circum&s;tances are found united. In&s;tead of this, we find the &s;ober and the in|du&s;trious branded by the vain and the idle with this odious appellation. Men who, by frugality and labour, rai&s;e them&s;elves above their equals, and contribute their &s;hare of indu&s;try to the common &s;tock.</P>
<P>WHATEVER the vain or the ignorant may &s;ay, well were it for &s;ociety had we more of the&s;e characters among&s;t us. In general, the&s;e clo&s;e men are found at la&s;t the true benefactors of &s;ociety. With an avaricious man we &s;eldom lo&s;e in our dealings, but too frequently in our commerce with prodigality.</P>
<P>A FRENCH prie&s;t, who&s;e name was Godi|not, went for a long time by the name of the Griper. He refu&s;ed to relieve the mo&s;t apparent wretchedne&s;s, and, by a &s;kilful management of his vineyard, had the good fortune to acquire immen&s;e &s;ums of money. The inhabitants of Rheims, who were his fellow-citizens, dete&s;ted him; and the populace, who &s;eldom love a mi|&s;er, wherever he went, followed him with &s;houts of contempt. He &s;till, however, continued his former &s;implicity of life, his amazing and unre|mitted
<PB N="50" REF="59">
frugality. He had long perceived the wants of the poor in the city, particularly in having no water but what they were obliged to buy at an advanced price; wherefore, that whole fortune which he had been ama&s;&s;ing, he laid out in an aqueduct; by which he did the poor more u&s;eful and la&s;ting &s;ervice, than if he had di&s;tributed his whole income in charity every day at his door.</P>
<P>AMONG men long conver&s;ant with books, we too frequently find tho&s;e mi&s;placed virtues, of which I have been now complaining. We find the &s;tudious animated with a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for the great virtues, as they are mi&s;takenly called, and utterly forgetful of the ordinary ones. The declamations of philo&s;ophy are ge|nerally rather exhau&s;ted on tho&s;e &s;upererogatory duties, than on &s;uch as are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;|&s;ary. A man, therefore, who has taken his ideas of mankind from &s;tudy alone, generally comes into the world with an heart melting at every fictitious di&s;tre&s;s. Thus he is induced, by mi&s;placed liberality, to put him&s;elf into the indigent circum&s;tances of the per&s;on he re|lieves.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this paper with the advice of one of the antients, to a young man whom

<HEADNOTE>
<P>N.B. This treati&s;e was publi&s;hed before Rou&s;|&s;eau's Emilius: if there be a &s;imilitude in any one in&s;tance, it is hoped the author of the pre&s;ent e&s;&s;ay will not be deemed a plagi|ari&s;t.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<P>AS few &s;ubjects are more intere&s;ting to &s;o|ciety, &s;o few have been more frequently written upon, than the education of youth. Yet it is a little &s;urprizing, that it has been treated almo&s;t by all in a declamatory manner. They have in&s;i&s;ted largely on the advantages that re&s;ult from it, both to individuals and to &s;ociety; and have expatiated in the prai&s;e of what none have ever been &s;o hardy as to call in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of giving us fine but empty ha|rangues upon this &s;ubject; in&s;tead of indulg|ing each his particular and whim&s;ical &s;y&s;tems, it had been much better if the writers on this &s;ubject had treated it in a more &s;cientific man|ner, repre&s;&s;ed all the &s;allies of imagination, and
<PB N="53" REF="62">
given us the re&s;ult of their ob&s;ervations with di|dactic &s;implicity. Upon this &s;ubject, the &s;malle&s;t errors are of the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equence; and the author &s;hould venture the imputation of &s;tupidity upon a topic, where his &s;lighte&s;t deviations may tend to injure the ri&s;ing genera|tion. However, &s;uch are the whim&s;ical and er|roneous productions written upon this &s;ubject. Their authors have &s;tudied to be uncommon, not to be ju&s;t; and, at pre&s;ent, we want a treati&s;e upon education, not to tell us any thing new, but, to explode the errors which have been introduced by the admirers of novelty. It is in this manner books become numerous; a de&s;ire of novelty produces a book, and other books are required to de&s;troy the former.</P>
<P>I SHALL, therefore, throw out a few thoughts upon this &s;ubject, which, though known, have not been attended to by others; and &s;hall di&s;|mi&s;s all attempts to plea&s;e, while I &s;tudy only in&s;truction.</P>
<P>THE manner in which our youth of Lon|don are at pre&s;ent educated, is, &s;ome in free-&s;chools in the city, but the far greater number in boarding-&s;chools about town. The parent ju&s;tly con&s;ults the health of his child, and finds
<PB N="54" REF="63">
an education in the country tends to promote this, much more than a continuance in town. Thus far he is right; if there were a po&s;&s;i|bility of having even our free-&s;chools kept a little out of town, it would certainly conduce to the health and vigour of, perhaps, the mind as well as the body. It may be thought whim|&s;ical, but it is truth; I have found, by experi|ence, that they, who have &s;pent all their lives in cities, contract not only an effeminacy of habit, but even of thinking.</P>
<P>BUT when I have &s;aid that the boarding-&s;chools are preferable to free-&s;chools, as being in the country, this is certainly the only advan|tage I can allow them, otherwi&s;e it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to conceive the ignorance of tho&s;e who take upon them the important tru&s;t of education. Is any man unfit for any of the profe&s;&s;ions, he finds his la&s;t re&s;ource in &s;etting up a &s;chool. Do any become bankrupts in trade, they &s;till &s;et up a boarding-&s;chool, and drive a trade this way, when all others fail: nay, I have been told of butchers and barbers, who have turned &s;chool-ma&s;ters; and, more &s;urpri&s;ing &s;till, made fortunes in their new profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>COULD we think our&s;elves in a country of civilized people; could it be conceived that we
<PB N="55" REF="64">
have any regard for po&s;terity, when &s;uch are permitted to take the charge of the morals, ge|nius and health of tho&s;e dear little pledges, who may one day be the guardians of the liberties of Europe; and who may &s;erve as the honour and bulkwark of their aged parents? The care of our children, is it below the &s;tate? Is it fit to indulge the caprice of the ignorant with the di&s;po&s;al of their children in this particular? For the &s;tate to take the charge of all its chil|dren, as in Per&s;ia or Sparta, might at pre&s;ent be inconvenient; but &s;urely, with great ea&s;e, it might ca&s;t an eye to their in&s;tructors. Of all profe&s;&s;ions in &s;ociety, I do not know a more u&s;eful, or a more honourable one, than a &s;chool-ma&s;ter; at the &s;ame time that I do not &s;ee any more generally de&s;pi&s;ed, or who&s;e talents are &s;o ill rewarded.</P>
<P>WERE the &s;alaries of &s;choolma&s;ters to be augmented from a diminution of u&s;ele&s;s &s;ine|cures, how might it turn to the advantage of this people; a people whom, without flattery, I may, in other re&s;pects, term the wi&s;e&s;t and greate&s;t upon earth. But while I would reward the de&s;erving, I would di&s;mi&s;s tho&s;e utterly un|qualified for their employment: in &s;hort, I would make the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter
<PB N="56" REF="65">
every way more re&s;pectable, by encrea&s;ing their &s;alaries, and admitting only men of proper abi|lities.</P>
<P>IT is true we have already &s;chool-ma&s;ters ap|pointed, and they have &s;ome &s;mall &s;alaries; but where at pre&s;ent there is only one &s;chool-ma&s;ter appointed, there &s;hould at lea&s;t be two; and wherever the &s;alary is at pre&s;ent twenty pounds, it &s;hould be an hundred. Do we give immode|rate benefices to tho&s;e who in&s;truct our&s;elves, and &s;hall we deny even &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to tho&s;e who in|&s;truct our children? Every member of &s;ociety &s;hould be paid in proportion as he is nece&s;&s;ary; and I will be bold enough to &s;ay, that &s;chool-ma&s;ters in a &s;tate, are more nece&s;&s;ary than cler|gymen, as children &s;tand in more need of in|&s;truction than their parents.</P>
<P>BUT in&s;tead of this, as I have already ob|&s;erved, we &s;end them to board in the country to the mo&s;t ignorant &s;et of men that can be imagined. But, lea&s;t the ignorance of the ma&s;ter be not &s;ufficient, the child is generally con&s;igned to the u&s;her. This is commonly &s;ome poor needy animal, little &s;uperior to a footman either in learning or &s;pirit, invited to his place by an adverti&s;ement, and kept there merely
<PB N="57" REF="66">
from his being of a complying di&s;po&s;ition, and making the children fond of him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You give your child to be educated to a &s;lave," &s;ays a philo&s;opher to a rich man; "in&s;tead of one &s;lave, you will then have two."</Q></P>
<P>IT were well, however, if parents, upon fixing their children in one of the&s;e hou&s;es, would examine the abilities of the u&s;her, as well as the ma&s;ter; for, whatever they are told to the contrary, the u&s;her is generally the per&s;on mo&s;t employed in their education. If then, a gentleman, upon putting out his &s;on to one of the&s;e hou&s;es, &s;ees the u&s;her di&s;regarded by the ma&s;ter, he may depend upon it, that he is equally di&s;regarded by the boys: the truth is, in &s;pite of all their endeavours to plea&s;e, they are generally the laughing-&s;tock of the &s;chool. Every trick is played upon the u&s;her; the od|dity of his manners, his dre&s;s, or his language, are a fund of eternal ridicule; the ma&s;ter him|&s;elf, now and then, cannot avoid joining in the laugh; and the poor wretch, eternally re&s;ent|ing this ill u&s;age, &s;eems to live in a &s;tate of war with all the family. This is a very proper per|&s;on, is it not, to give children a reli&s;h for learn|ing? They mu&s;t e&s;teem learning very much, when they &s;ee its profe&s;&s;ors u&s;ed with &s;uch little
<PB N="58" REF="67">
ceremony. If the u&s;her be de&s;pi&s;ed, the father may be a&s;&s;ured his child will never be properly in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>BUT let me &s;uppo&s;e, that there are &s;ome &s;chools without the&s;e inconveniencies, where the ma&s;ters and u&s;hers are men of learning, re|putation and a&s;&s;iduity. If there are to be found &s;uch, they cannot be prized in a &s;tate &s;uffici|ently. A boy will learn more true wi&s;dom in a public &s;chool in a year, than by a private educa|tion in five. It is not from ma&s;ters, but from their equals, youth learn a knowledge of the world; the little tricks they play each other, the puni&s;hment that frequently attends the com|mi&s;&s;ion, is a ju&s;t picture of the great world; and all the ways of men are practi&s;ed in a pub|lic &s;chool in miniature. It is true, a child is early made acquainted with &s;ome vices in a &s;chool; but it is better to know the&s;e when a boy, than be fir&s;t taught them when a man; for their novelty then may have irre&s;i&s;tible charms.</P>
<P>IN a public education, boys early learn tem|perance; and if the parents and friends would give them le&s;s money upon their u&s;ual vi&s;its, it would be much to their advantage; &s;ince it
<PB N="59" REF="68">
may ju&s;tly be &s;aid, that a great part of their di&s;orders ari&s;e from &s;urfeit, Plus occidit gula quam gladius. And now I am come to the ar|ticle of health, it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that Mr. Locke, and &s;ome others, have advi&s;ed that children &s;hould be inured to cold, to fa|tigue, and hard&s;hip, from their youth; but Mr. Locke was but an indifferent phy&s;ician. Habit, I grant, has great influence over our con&s;titutions, but we have not preci&s;e ideas up|on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>WE know, that among &s;avages, and even among our pea&s;ants, there are found children born with &s;uch con&s;titutions, that they cro&s;s rivers by &s;wimming, endure cold, thir&s;t, hunger, and want of &s;leep, to a &s;urpri&s;ing degree; that, when they happen to fall &s;ick, they are cured without the help of medicine, by nature alone. Such examples are adduced to per&s;uade us to imitate their manner of education, and accu&s;tom our&s;elves betimes to &s;upport the &s;ame fatigues. But had the&s;e gentlemen con&s;idered fir&s;t, how many lives are lo&s;t in this a&s;cetic practice; had they con&s;idered, that tho&s;e &s;avages and pea&s;ants are generally not &s;o long lived as they who have led a more indolent life; that the more laborious the life is, the le&s;s populous is the country: had
<PB N="60" REF="69">
they con&s;idered, that what phy&s;icians call the Stamina Vitae, by fatigue and labour become ri|gid, and thus anticipate old age: that the num|ber who &s;urvive tho&s;e rude trials, bears no pro|portion to tho&s;e who die in the experiment. Had the&s;e things been properly con&s;idered, they would not have thus extolled an education be|gun in fatigue and hard&s;hips. Peter the Great, willing to enure the children of his &s;eamen to a life of hard&s;hip, ordered that they &s;hould only drink &s;ea-water, but they unfortunately all died under the trial.</P>
<P>BUT while I would exclude all unnece&s;&s;ary labours, yet &s;till I would recommend temper|ance in the highe&s;t degree. No luxurious di&s;hes with high &s;ea&s;oning, nothing given chil|dren to force an appetite, as little &s;ugared or &s;alted provi&s;ions as po&s;&s;ible, though ever &s;o plea&s;ing; but milk, morning and night, &s;hould be their con&s;tant food. This diet would make them more healthy than any of tho&s;e &s;lops that are u&s;ually cooked by the mi&s;tre&s;s of a boarding-&s;chool; be&s;ides, it corrects any con&s;umptive habits, not unfrequently found among&s;t the children of city parents.</P>
<P>AS boys &s;hould be educated with temper|ance, &s;o the fir&s;t greate&s;t le&s;&s;on that &s;hould
<PB N="61" REF="70">
be taught them is, to admire frugality. It is by the exerci&s;e of this virtue alone, they can ever expect to be u&s;eful members of &s;ociety. It is true, lectures continually repeated upon this &s;ubject, may make &s;ome boys, when they grow up, run into an extreme, and become mi&s;ers; but it were well, had we more mi&s;ers than we have among us. I know few characters more u&s;eful in &s;ociety; for a man's having a larger or &s;maller &s;hare of money lying u&s;ele&s;s by him, no way injures the commonwealth; &s;ince, &s;hould every mi&s;er now exhau&s;t his &s;tores, this might make gold more plenty, but it would not encrea&s;e the commodities or plea&s;ures of life; they would &s;till remain as they are at pre&s;ent: it matters not, therefore, whether men are mi|&s;ers or not, if they be only frugal, laborious, and fill the &s;tation they have cho&s;en. If they deny them&s;elves the nece&s;&s;aries of life, &s;ociety is no way injured by their folly.</P>
<P>INSTEAD, therefore, of romances, which prai&s;e young men of &s;pirit, who go through a variety of adventures, and at la&s;t conclude a life of di&s;&s;ipation, folly, and extravagance in riches and matrimony, there &s;hould be &s;ome men of wit employed to compo&s;e books that might equally intere&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions of our youth, where
<PB N="62" REF="71">
&s;uch an one might be prai&s;ed for having re&s;i&s;ted allurements when young, and how he, at la&s;t, became lord-mayor; how he was married to a lady of great &s;en&s;e, fortune, and beauty: to be as explicit as po&s;&s;ible, the old &s;tory of Whit|tington, were his cat left out, might be more &s;erviceable to the tender mind, than either Tom Jones, Jo&s;eph Andrews, or an hundred others, where frugality is the only good quality the hero is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. Were our &s;chool-ma&s;ters, if any of them have &s;en&s;e enough to draw up &s;uch a work, thus employed, it would be much more &s;erviceable to their pupils than all the grammars and dictionaries they may pub|li&s;h the&s;e ten years.</P>
<P>CHILDREN &s;hould early be in&s;tructed in the arts from which they may afterwards draw the greate&s;t advantages. When the wonders of nature are never expo&s;ed to our view, we have no great de&s;ire to become acquainted with tho&s;e parts of learning which pretend to account for the phaenomena. One of the antients com|plains, that as &s;oon as young men have left &s;chool, and are obliged to conver&s;e in the world, they fancy them&s;elves tran&s;ported into a new region. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ut cum in forum venerint ex|i&s;timent &s;e in aliam terrarum orbem delatos."</Q>
<PB N="63" REF="72">
We &s;hould early, therefore, in&s;truct them in the experiments, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, of know|ledge, and leave to maturer age the account|ing for the cau&s;es. But, in&s;tead of that, when boys begin natural philo&s;ophy in colleges, they have not the lea&s;t curio&s;ity for tho&s;e parts of the &s;cience which are propo&s;ed for their in&s;truction; they have never before &s;een the phaenomena, and con&s;equently have no curio&s;ity to learn the rea&s;ons. Might natural philo&s;ophy, therefore, be made their pa&s;time in &s;chool, by this means it would in college become their amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>IN &s;everal of the machines now in u&s;e, there would be ample field both for in&s;truction and amu&s;ement; the different &s;orts of the pho&s;pho|rus, the artificial pyrites, magneti&s;m, electri|city, the experiments upon the rarefaction and weight of the air, and tho&s;e upon ela&s;tic bodies, might employ their idle hours, and none &s;hould be called from play to &s;ee &s;uch experiments but &s;uch as thought proper. At fir&s;t then it would be &s;ufficient if the in&s;truments, and the effects of their combination, were only &s;hewn; the cau&s;es &s;hould be deferred to a maturer age, or to tho&s;e times when natural curio&s;ity prompts us to di&s;cover the wonders of nature. Man is placed in this world as a &s;pectator; when he is
<PB N="64" REF="73">
tired of wondering at all the novelties about him, and not till then, does he de&s;ire to be made acquainted with the cau&s;es that create tho&s;e wonders.</P>
<P>WHAT I have ob&s;erved with regard to na|tural philo&s;ophy, I would extend to every other &s;cience what&s;oever. We &s;hould teach them as many of the facts as were po&s;&s;ible, and defer the cau&s;es until they &s;eemed of them&s;elves de&s;irous of knowing them. A mind thus leaving &s;chool, &s;tored with all the &s;imple experiences of &s;cience, would be the fitte&s;t in the world for the college cour&s;e; and, though &s;uch a youth might not appear &s;o bright, or &s;o talkative, as tho&s;e who had learned the real principles and cau&s;es of &s;ome of the &s;ciences, yet he would make a wi&s;er man, and would retain a more la&s;ting pa&s;&s;ion for letters, than he who was early burdened with the di&s;agreeable in&s;titution of effect and cau&s;e.</P>
<P>IN hi&s;tory, &s;uch &s;tories alone &s;hould be laid before them as might catch the imagination: in&s;tead of this, they are too frequently obliged to toil through the four empires, as they are called, where their memories are burdened by a number of di&s;gu&s;ting names, that de&s;troy all
<PB N="65" REF="74">
their future reli&s;h for our be&s;t hi&s;torians, who may be termed the true&s;t teachers of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>EVERY &s;pecies of flattery &s;hould be carefully avoided; a boy who happens to &s;ay a &s;prightly thing is generally applauded &s;o much, that he &s;ometimes continues a coxcomb all his life after. He is reputed a wit at fourteen, and becomes a blockhead at twenty. Nur&s;es, foot|men, and &s;uch, &s;hould therefore be driven away as much as po&s;&s;ible. I was even going to add, that the mother her&s;elf &s;hould &s;tifle her plea&s;ure, or her vanity, when little ma&s;ter hap|pens to &s;ay a good or a &s;mart thing. Tho&s;e mode&s;t lubberly boys, who &s;eem to want &s;pirit, generally go through their bu&s;ine&s;s with more ea&s;e to them&s;elves, and more &s;atisfaction to their in&s;tructors.</P>
<P>THERE has of late a gentleman appeared, who thinks the &s;tudy of rhetoric e&s;&s;ential to a perfect education. That bold male eloquence, which often, without plea&s;ing, convinces, is generally de&s;troyed by &s;uch in&s;titutions. Con|vincing eloquence, is infinitely more &s;ervice|able to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or than the mo&s;t florid ha|rangue or the mo&s;t pathetic tones that can be imagined; and the man who is thoroughly con|vinced
<PB N="66" REF="75">
him&s;elf, who under&s;tands his &s;ubject, and the language he &s;peaks in, will be more apt to &s;ilence oppo&s;ition, than he who &s;tudies the force of his periods, and fills our ears with &s;ounds, while our minds are de&s;titute of con|viction.</P>
<P>IT was reckoned the fault of the orators at the decline of the Roman empire, when they had been long in&s;tructed by rhetoricians, that their periods were &s;o harmonious, as that they could be &s;ung as well as &s;poken. What a ridi|culous figure mu&s;t one of the&s;e gentlemen cut, thus mea&s;uring &s;yllables, and weighing words, when he &s;hould plead the cau&s;e of his client! Two architects were once candidates for the building a certain temple at Athens; the fir&s;t harangued the crowd very learnedly upon the different orders of architecture, and &s;hewed them in what manner the temple &s;hould be built; the other, who got up after him, only ob&s;erved, that what his brother had &s;poken he could do; and thus he at once gained his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>TO teach men to be orators, is little le&s;s than to teach them to be poets; and, for my part, I &s;hould have too great a regard for my
<PB N="67" REF="76">
child, to wi&s;h him a manor only in a book|&s;eller's &s;hop.</P>
<P>ANOTHER pa&s;&s;ion which the pre&s;ent age is apt to run into, is to make children learn all things; the languages, the &s;ciences, mu&s;ic, the exerci&s;es, and painting. Thus the child &s;oon becomes a Talker in all, but a Ma&s;ter in none. He thus acquires a &s;uperficial fondne&s;s for every thing, and only &s;hews his ignorance when he attempts to exhibit his &s;kill.</P>
<P>AS I deliver my thoughts without method or connection, &s;o the reader mu&s;t not be &s;urprized to find me once more addre&s;&s;ing &s;choolma&s;ters on the pre&s;ent method of teaching the learned languages, which is commonly by literal tran&s;|lations. I would a&s;k &s;uch, if they were to tra|vel a journey, whether tho&s;e parts of the road in which they found the greate&s;t difficulties, would not be the mo&s;t &s;trongly remembered? Boys who, if I may continue the allu&s;ion, gal|lop through one of the antients with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a tran&s;lation, can have but a very &s;light acquaintance either with the author or his lan|guage. It is by the exerci&s;e of the mind alone that a language is learned; but a literal tran&s;|lation, on the oppo&s;ite page, leaves no exerci&s;e
<PB N="68" REF="77">
for the memory at all. The boy will not be at the fatigue of remembering, when his doubts are at once &s;atisfied by a glance of the eye; where|as, were every word to be &s;ought from a dic|tionary, the learner would attempt to remem|ber them, to &s;ave him&s;elf the trouble of looking out for it for the future.</P>
<P>TO continue in the &s;ame pedantic &s;train, of all the various grammars now taught in the &s;chools about town, I would recommend only the old common one; I have forgot whether Lily's or an emendation of him. The others may be improvements; but &s;uch improvements &s;eem, to me, only mere grammatical niceties, no way influencing the learner, but perhaps loading him with trifling &s;ubtilties, which, at a proper age, he mu&s;t be at &s;ome pains to for|get.</P>
<P>WHATEVER pains a ma&s;ter may take to make the learning of the languages agreeable to his pupil, he may depend upon it, it will be at fir&s;t extremely unplea&s;ant. The rudiments of every language, therefore, mu&s;t be given as a ta&s;k, not as an amu&s;ement. Attempting to de|ceive children into in&s;truction of this kind, is only deceiving our&s;elves; and I know no pa&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="69" REF="78">
capable of conquering a child's natural la|zine&s;s but fear. Solomon has &s;aid it before me; nor is there any more certain, though perhaps more di&s;agreeable truth, than the proverb in ver&s;e, too well known to repeat on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. It is very probable that parents are told of &s;ome ma&s;ters who never u&s;e the rod, and con&s;equently are thought the propere&s;t in&s;truc|tors for their children; but, though tenderne&s;s is a requi&s;ite quality in an in&s;tructor, yet there is too often the true&s;t tenderne&s;s in well-timed correction.</P>
<P>SOME have ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that all pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould be bani&s;hed on this terrible occa&s;ion; but I know not how; there is a frailty attend|ing human-nature, that few ma&s;ters are able to keep their temper whil&s;t they correct. I knew a good-natured man, who was &s;en&s;ible of his own weakne&s;s in this re&s;pect, and con&s;equently had recour&s;e to the following expedient to pre|vent his pa&s;&s;ions from being engaged, yet at the &s;ame time admini&s;ter ju&s;tice with impartiality. Whenever any of his pupils committed a fault, he &s;ummoned a jury of his peers, I mean of the boys of his own or the next cla&s;&s;es to him: his accu&s;ers &s;tood forth; he had liberty of pleading in his own defence, and one or two more had
<PB N="70" REF="79">
the liberty of pleading again&s;t him: when found guilty by the panel, he was con&s;igned to the footman, who attended in the hou&s;e, and had previous orders to puni&s;h, but with lenity. By this means the ma&s;ter took off the odium of puni&s;hment from him&s;elf; and the footman, between whom and the boys there could not be even the &s;lighte&s;t intimacy, was placed in &s;uch a light as to be &s;hunned by every boy in the &s;chool.</P>

<P>AS Alexander VI. was entering a little town in the neighbourhood of Rome, which had been ju&s;t evacuated by the enemy, he perceived the town&s;men bu&s;y in the market-place in pulling down from a gibbet a figure which had been de&s;igned to repre&s;ent him&s;elf. There were &s;ome al&s;o knocking down a neighbouring &s;tatue of one of the Or&s;ini family, with whom he was at war, in order to put Alexander's effigy in its place.

<P>MY hone&s;t friends and brother politicians; I perceive that the intended war with Spain makes many of you unea&s;y. Ye&s;terday, as we were told, the &s;tocks ro&s;e, and you were glad; to day they fall, and you are again mi&s;erable.

<HEAD>Rules for rai&s;ing the Devil. Tran&s;lated from the Latin of Danaeus de Sortiariis, a Writer cotemporary with Calvin, and one of the Reformers of our Church.</HEAD>
<P>THE per&s;on who de&s;ires to rai&s;e the Devil, is to &s;acrifice a dog, a cat, and a hen, all of his own property, to Beelzebub. He is to &s;wear an eternal obedience, and then to receive a mark in &s;ome un&s;een place, either under the eye-lid, or in the roof of the mouth, inflicted by the devil him&s;elf. Upon this he has power given him over three &s;pirits; one for earth, another for air, and a third for the &s;ea. Upon certain times the devil holds an a&s;&s;embly of ma|gicians, in which each is to give an account of what evil he has done, and what he wi&s;hes to do. At this a&s;&s;embly he appears in the &s;hape of an old man, or often like a goat with large horns. They, upon this occa&s;ion, renew their vows of obedience; and then form a grand dance in honour of their fal&s;e deity. The devil in&s;tructs them in every method of injuring man|kind, in gathering poi&s;ons, and of riding upon occa&s;ion through the air. He &s;hews them the whole method, upon examination, of giving eva&s;ive an&s;wers; his &s;pirits have power to a&s;|&s;ume the form of angels of light, and there is

but one method of detecting them; viz. to a&s;k them, in proper form, What method is the mo&s;t certain to propagate the faith over all the world? To this they are not permitted by the Superior Power to make a fal&s;e reply, nor are they willing to give the true one, wherefore they continue &s;ilent, and are thus detected.</P>

<P>THOUGH naturally pen&s;ive, yet I am fond of gay company, and take every opportunity of thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the mind from duty. From this motive I am often found in the centre of a crowd; and wherever plea&s;ure is to be &s;old, am always a purcha&s;er. In tho&s;e places, without being remarked by any, I join in whatever goes forward, work my pa&s;&s;ions into a &s;imilitude of frivolous earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;hout as they &s;hout, and condemn as they happen to di&s;approve. A mind thus funk for a while be|low its natural &s;tandard, is qualified for &s;tronger flights, as tho&s;e fir&s;t retire who would &s;pring forward with greater vigour.</P>
<P>ATTRACTED by the &s;erenity of the evening, a friend and I lately went to gaze upon the company in one of the public walks near the city. Here we &s;auntered together for &s;ome time, either prai&s;ing the beauty of &s;uch as were hand&s;ome, or the dre&s;&s;es of &s;uch as had nothing el&s;e to recommend them. We had gone thus deliberately forward for &s;ome time, when my

friend &s;topping on a &s;udden, caught me by the elbow, and led me out of the public walk; I could perceive, by the quickne&s;s of his pace, and by his frequently looking behind, that he was attempting to avoid &s;omebody who follow|ed; we now turned to the right, then to the left; as we went forward, he &s;till went fa&s;ter, but in vain; the per&s;on whom he attempted to e&s;cape, hunted us through every doubling, and gained upon us each moment; &s;o that, at la&s;t, we fairly &s;tood &s;till, re&s;olving to face what we could not avoid.</P>
<P>OUR pur&s;uer &s;oon came up, and joined us with all the familiarity of an old acquaintance. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear Charles," cries he, &s;haking my friend's hand, "where have you been hiding this half a century? Po&s;itively I had fancied you were gone down to cultivate matrimony and your e&s;tate in the country."</Q> During the reply, I had an opportunity of &s;urveying the appearance of our new companion. His hat was pinched up with peculiar &s;martne&s;s; his looks were pale, thin, and &s;harp; round his neck he wore a broad black ribbon, and in his bo&s;om a buckle &s;tudded with gla&s;s; his coat was trimmed with tarni&s;hed twi&s;t; he wore by his &s;ide a &s;word with a black hilt; and his &s;tock|ings

of &s;ilk, though newly wa&s;hed, were grown yellow by long &s;ervice. I was &s;o much en|gaged with the peculiarity of his dre&s;s, that I attended only to the latter part of my friend's reply; in which he complimented Mr. Tibbs on the ta&s;te of his cloaths, and the bloom in his countenance. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"P&s;ha, p&s;ha, Charles," cried the figure, "no more of that if you love me; you know I hate flattery, on my &s;oul I do; and yet to be &s;ure an intimacy with the great will improve one's appearance, and a cour&s;e of veni&s;on will fatten; and yet faith I de&s;pi&s;e the great as much as you do; but there are a great many damned hone&s;t fellows among them; and we mu&s;t not quarrel with one half becau&s;e the other wants breeding. If they were all &s;uch as my lord Mudler, one of the mo&s;t good-natured creatures that ever &s;queezed a lemon, I &s;hould my&s;elf be among the number of their admirers. I was ye&s;ter|day to dine at the dutche&s;s of Piccadilly's. My lord was there.

I'll tell you a plea&s;ant affair about that: we were a &s;elect party of us to dine at lady Grogram's, an affected piece, but let it go no farther; a &s;ecret: Well, &s;ays I, I'll hold a thou&s;and guineas, and &s;ay done fir&s;t, that&mdash;But, dear

<P>WHEN he left us, our conver&s;ation naturally turned upon &s;o extraordinary a character. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"His very dre&s;s, cries my friend, "is not le&s;s extraordinary than his conduct.

<P>THERE are &s;ome acquaintances whom it is no ea&s;y matter to &s;hake off. My little beau ye&s;terday overtook me again in one of the public walks, and, &s;lapping me on the &s;houlder, &s;aluted me with an air of the mo&s;t perfect fa|miliarity. His dre&s;s was the &s;ame as u&s;ual, ex|cept that he had more powder in his hair; wore a dirtier &s;hirt, and had on a pair of temple &s;pec|tacles, and his hat under his arm.</P>
<P>AS I knew him to be an harmle&s;s amu&s;ing little thing, I could not return his &s;miles with any degree of &s;everity; &s;o we walked forward on terms of the utmo&s;t intimacy, and in a few minutes di&s;cu&s;&s;ed all the u&s;ual topics prelimi|nary to particular conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>THE oddities that marked his character, however, &s;oon began to appear; he bowed to &s;everal well-dre&s;&s;ed per&s;ons, who, by their man|ner of returning the compliment, appeared perfect &s;trangers. At intervals he drew out a pocket-book, &s;eeming to take memorandums

before all the company with much importance and a&s;&s;iduity. In this manner he led me through the length of the whole Mall, fretting at his ab&s;urdities, and fancying my&s;elf laughed at as well as he by every &s;pectator.</P>
<P>WHEN we were got to the end of our pro|ce&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Bla&s;t me," cries he, with an air of vivacity, "I never &s;aw the Park &s;o thin in my life before; there's no company at all to day.

<P>THUS &s;aying, without waiting for a reply, he took me by the arm and hauled me along. We pa&s;&s;ed through many dark alleys and wind|ing ways; for, from &s;ome motives to me un|known, he &s;eemed to have a particular aver&s;ion to every frequented &s;treet; at la&s;t, however, we got to the door of a di&s;mal looking hou&s;e in the outlets of the town, where he informed me he cho&s;e to re&s;ide for the benefit of the air.</P>
<P>WE entered the lower door, which &s;eemed ever to lie mo&s;t ho&s;pitably open; and I began
<PB N="93" REF="102">
to a&s;cend an old and creaking &s;tair-ca&s;e; when, as he mounted to &s;hew me the way, he de|manded, whether I delighted in pro&s;pects; to which an&s;wering in the affirmative, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then," &s;ays he, "I &s;hall &s;hew you one of the mo&s;t charming out of my windows; we &s;hall &s;ee the &s;hips &s;ailing, and the whole country for twenty miles round, tip top, quite high. My lord Swamp would give ten thou&s;and guineas for &s;uch a one; but, as I &s;ometimes plea&s;antly tell him, I always love to keep my pro&s;pects at home, that my friends may come to &s;ee me the oftener."</Q></P>
<P>BY this time we were arrived as high as the &s;tairs would permit us to a&s;cend, till we came to what he was facetiou&s;ly plea&s;ed to call the fir&s;t floor down the chimney; and knocking at the door, a voice, with a Scotch accent, from within, demanded, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Wha's there?"</Q> My con|ductor an&s;wered, that it was him. But this not &s;atisfying the queri&s;t, the voice again repeated the demand; to which he an&s;wered louder than before, and now the door was opened by an old maid &s;ervant with cautious reluctance.</P>
<P>WHEN we were got in, he welcomed me to his hou&s;e with great ceremony, and turning to

the old woman, a&s;ked where her lady was. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good troth," replied &s;he in the northern di|alect, "&s;he's wa&s;hing your twa &s;hirts at the next door, becau&s;e they have taken an oath again&s;t lending out the tub any longer."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My two &s;hirts!" cries he in a tone that faul|tered with confu&s;ion, "what does the ideot mean?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I ken what I mean well enough," replied the other; ";&s;he's wa&s;hing your twa &s;hirts at the next door, becau&s;e"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fire and fury, no more of thy &s;tupid explanations," cried he.&mdash;"Go and inform her we have got company.

<P>WE waited &s;ome time for Mrs. Tibbs's ar|rival, during which interval I had a full oppor|tunity of &s;urveying the chamber and all its fur|niture; which con&s;i&s;ted of four chairs with old wrought bottoms, that he a&s;&s;ured me were his

<P>AS it has been ob&s;erved that few are better qualified to give others advice, than tho&s;e who have taken the lea&s;t of it them&s;elves; &s;o in this re&s;pect I find my&s;elf perfectly authorized to offer mine; and mu&s;t take leave to throw to|gether a few ob&s;ervations upon that part of a young man's conduct on his entering into life as it is called.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t u&s;ual way among young men who have no re&s;olution of their own, is fir&s;t to a&s;k one friend's advice, and follow it for &s;ome time; then to a&s;k advice of another, and turn to that; &s;o of a third, &s;till un&s;teady, always changing. However, every change of this nature is for the wor&s;e; people may tell you of your being unfit for &s;ome peculiar occupations in life; but heed them not; whatever employment you fol|low with per&s;everance and a&s;&s;iduity, will be found fit for you; it will be your &s;upport in youth and comfort in age. In learning the u&s;e|ful part of every profe&s;&s;ion, very moderate abi|lities

will &s;uffice: great abilities are generally obnoxious to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Life has been com|pared to a race; but the allu&s;ion &s;till improves, by ob&s;erving, that the mo&s;t &s;wift are ever the mo&s;t apt to &s;tray from the cour&s;e.</P>
<P>TO know one profe&s;&s;ion only, is enough for one man to know; and this, whatever the pro|fe&s;&s;ors may tell you to the contrary, is &s;oon learned. Be contented, therefore, with one good employment; for if you under&s;tand two at a time, people will give you bu&s;ine&s;s in nei|ther.</P>

<P>THERE are no ob&s;tructions more fatal to fortune than pride and re&s;entment. If you mu&s;t re&s;ent injuries at all, at lea&s;t &s;uppre&s;s your in|dignation till you become rich, and then &s;hew away. The re&s;entment of a poor man is like the efforts of a harmle&s;s in&s;ect to &s;ting; it may get him cru&s;hed, but cannot defend him. Who values that anger which is con&s;umed only in empty menaces?</P>
<P>ONCE upon a time a goo&s;e fed its young by a pond &s;ide; and a goo&s;e, in &s;uch circum|&s;tances, is always extremely proud, and exce&s;|&s;ively punctilious. If any other animal, with|out the lea&s;t de&s;ign to offend, happened to pa&s;s that way, the goo&s;e was immediately at it. The pond, &s;he &s;aid, was hers, and &s;he would main|tain
<PB N="100" REF="109">
her right in it, and &s;upport her honour, while &s;he had a bill to hi&s;s, or a wing to flut|ter. In this manner &s;he drove away ducks, pigs, and chickens; nay, even the in&s;idious cat was &s;een to &s;camper. A lounging ma&s;tiff, how|ever, happened to pa&s;s by, and thought it no harm if he &s;hould lap a little of the water, as he was thir&s;ty. The guardian goo&s;e flew at him like a fury, pecked at him with her beak, and &s;lapped him with her feathers. The dog grew angry, and had twenty times a mind to give her a &s;ly &s;nap; but &s;uppre&s;&s;ing his indig|nation, becau&s;e his ma&s;ter was nigh, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A pox take thee," cries he, "for a fool, &s;ure tho&s;e who have neither &s;trength nor weapons to fight, at lea&s;t &s;hould be civil."</Q> So &s;aying, he went forward to the pond, quenched his thir&s;t, in &s;pite of the goo&s;e, and followed his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>ANOTHER ob&s;truction to the fortune of youth is, that, while they are willing to take offence from none, they are al&s;o equally de&s;i|rous of giving nobody offence. From hence they endeavour to plea&s;e all, comply with every reque&s;t, and attempt to &s;uit them&s;elves to every company; have no will of their own; but,
<PB N="101" REF="110">
like wax, catch every contiguous impre&s;&s;ion. By thus attempting to give univer&s;al &s;atisfac|tion, they at la&s;t find them&s;elves mi&s;erably di&s;|appointed; to bring the generality of admirers on our &s;ide, it is &s;ufficient to attempt plea&s;ing a very few.</P>
<P>A PAINTER of eminence was once re&s;olved to fini&s;h a piece which &s;hould plea&s;e the whole world. When, therefore, he had drawn a picture, in which his utmo&s;t &s;kill was exhau&s;t|ed, it was expo&s;ed in the public market-place, with directions at the bottom for every &s;pecta|tor to mark with a bru&s;h, that lay by, every limb and feature which &s;eemed erroneous. The &s;pectators came, and, in general, applauded; but each willing to &s;hew his talent at critici&s;m, &s;tigmatized whatever he thought proper. At evening, when the painter came, he was mor|tified to find the picture one univer&s;al blot; not a &s;ingle &s;troke that had not the marks of di&s;approbation. Not &s;atisfied with this trial&punc; the next day he was re&s;olved to try them in a different manner; and expo&s;ing his picture as before, de&s;ired that every &s;pectator would mark tho&s;e beauties he approved or admired. The people complied, and the arti&s;t returning, found

<P>INDULGENT nature &s;eems to have ex|empted this i&s;land from many of tho&s;e epi|demic evils which are &s;o fatal in other parts of the world. A want of rain for a few days beyond the expected &s;ea&s;on, in &s;ome parts of the globe, &s;preads famine, de&s;olation, and ter|ror, over the whole country; but, in this for|tunate land of Britain, the inhabitant courts health in every breeze, and the hu&s;bandman ever &s;ows in joyful expectation.</P>
<P>BUT, though the nation be exempt from real evils, it is not more happy on this account than others. The people are afflicted, it is true, with neither famine nor pe&s;tilence; but then there is a di&s;order peculiar to the country, which every &s;ea&s;on makes &s;trange ravages among them; it &s;preads with pe&s;tilential rapidity, and infects almo&s;t every rank of people; what is &s;till more &s;trange, the natives have no name for this peculiar malady, though well known to fo|reign phy&s;icians by the appellation of Epidemic Terror.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="113">A SEASON is never known to pa&s;s in which the people are not vi&s;ited by this cruel calamity in one &s;hape or another, &s;eemingly different, though ever the &s;ame; one year it i&s;&s;ues from a baker's &s;hop in the &s;hape of a &s;ixpenny loaf, the next it takes the appearance of a comet with a fiery tail, the third it threatens like a flat-bottomed boat, and the fourth it carries con|&s;ternation in the bite of a mad dog. The peo|ple, when once infected, lo&s;e their reli&s;h for happine&s;s, &s;aunter about with looks of de&s;pon|dence, a&s;k after the calamities of the day, and receive no comfort but in heightening each other's di&s;tre&s;s. It is in&s;ignificant how remote or near, how weak or powerful, the object of terror may be, when once they re&s;olve to fright and be frighted; the mere&s;t trifles &s;ow con&s;ter|nation and di&s;may; each proportions his fears, not to the object, but to the dread he di&s;co|vers in the countenance of others; for, when once the fermentation is begun, it goes on of it&s;elf, though the original cau&s;e be di&s;conti|nued which fir&s;t &s;et it in motion.</P>
<P>A DREAD of mad dogs is the epidemic ter|ror which now prevails, and the whole nation is at pre&s;ent actually groaning under the malig|nity of its influence. The people &s;ally from

their hou&s;es with that circum&s;pection which is prudent in &s;uch as expect a mad dog at every turning. The phy&s;ician publi&s;hes his pre&s;crip|tion, the beadle prepares his halter, and a few of unu&s;ual bravery arm them&s;elves with boots and buff gloves, in order to face the enemy if he &s;hould offer to attack them. In &s;hort, the whole people &s;tand bravely upon their defence, and &s;eem, by their pre&s;ent &s;pirit, to &s;hew a re|&s;olution of being tamely bit by mad dogs no longer.</P>
<P>THEIR manner of knowing whether a dog be mad or no, &s;omewhat re&s;embles the antient Gothic cu&s;tom of trying witches. The old woman &s;u&s;pected was tied hand and foot and thrown into the water. If the &s;wam, then &s;he was in&s;tantly carried off to be burnt for a witch; if &s;he &s;unk, then indeed &s;he was acquitted of the charge, but drowned in the experiment. In the &s;ame manner a crowd gather round a dog &s;u&s;pected of madne&s;s, and they begin by teizing the devoted animal on every &s;ide. If he at|tempts to &s;tand upon the defen&s;ive, and bite, then is he unanimou&s;ly found guilty, for <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A mad dog always &s;naps at every thing."</Q> If, on the contrary, he &s;trives to e&s;cape by running away, then he can expect no compa&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for

mad dogs always run &s;traight forward before them."</Q></P>
<P>IT is plea&s;ant enough for a neutral being like me, who have no &s;hare in tho&s;e ideal calami|ties, to mark the &s;tages of this national di&s;ea&s;e. The terror at fir&s;t feebly enters with a di&s;re|garded &s;tory of a little dog, that had gone through a neighbouring village, which was thought to be mad by &s;everal who had &s;een him. The next account comes, that a ma&s;tiff ran through a certain town, and had bit five gee&s;e, which immediately ran mad, foamed at the bill, and died in great agonies &s;oon after. Then comes an affecting hi&s;tory of a little boy bit in the leg, and gone down to be dipped in the &s;alt water. When the people have &s;uffici|ently &s;huddered at that, they are next con|gealed with a frightful account of a man who was &s;aid lately to have died from a bite he had received &s;ome years before. This relation only prepares the way for another, &s;till more hide|ous; as how the ma&s;ter of a family, with &s;even &s;mall children, were all bit by a mad lap-dog; and how the poor father fir&s;t perceived the in|fection by calling for a draught of water, where he &s;aw the lap-dog &s;wimming in the cup.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="116">WHEN epidemic terror is thus once excited, every morning comes loaded with &s;ome new di&s;|a&s;ter; as in &s;tories of gho&s;ts each loves to hear the account, though it only &s;erves to make him unea&s;y; &s;o here each li&s;tens with eagerne&s;s, and adds to the tidings with new circum&s;tances of peculiar horror. A lady, for in&s;tance, in the country, of very weak nerves, has been frighted by the barking of a dog; and this, alas! too frequently happens. The &s;tory &s;oon is improved and &s;preads, that a mad dog had frighted a lady of di&s;tinction. The&s;e circum|&s;tances begin to grow terrible before they have reached the neighbouring village; and there the report is, that a lady of quality was bit by a mad ma&s;tiff. This account every moment gathers new &s;trength, and grows more di&s;mal as it approaches the capital; and, by the time it has arrived in town, the lady is de&s;cribed with wild eyes, foaming mouth, running mad upon all four, barking like a dog, biting her &s;ervants, and at la&s;t &s;mothered between two beds by the advice of her doctors; while the mad ma&s;tiff is, in the mean time, ranging the whole country over, &s;lavering at the mouth, and &s;eeking whom he may devour.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="117">MY landlady, a good-natured woman, but a little credulous, waked me &s;ome mornings ago, before the u&s;ual hour, with horror and a&s;toni&s;hment in her looks. She de&s;ired me, if I had any regard for my &s;afety, to keep within; for, a few days ago, &s;o di&s;mal an ac|cident had happened, as to put all the world upon their guard. A mad dog down in the country, &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, had bit a farmer, who &s;oon becoming mad, ran into his own yard and bit a fine brindled cow; the cow quickly be|came as mad as the man, began to foam at the mouth, and rai&s;ing her&s;elf up, walked about on her hind legs, &s;ometimes barking like a dog, and &s;ometimes attempting to talk like the far|mer. Upon examining the grounds of this &s;tory, I found my landlady had it from one neighbour, who had it from another neigh|bour, who heard it from very good authority.</P>
<P>WERE mo&s;t &s;tories of this nature well ex|amined, it would be found that numbers of &s;uch as have been &s;aid to &s;uffer were no way injured; and that of tho&s;e who have been actu|ally bitten, not one in a hundred was bit by a mad dog.

<PB N="109" REF="118">
by fal&s;e terrors, and &s;ometimes fright the pa|tient into actual phrenzy, by creating tho&s;e very &s;ymptoms they pretended to deplore.</P>
<P>BUT even allowing three or four to die in a &s;ea&s;on of this terrible death (and four is pro|bably too large a conce&s;&s;ion) yet &s;till it is not con&s;idered, how many are pre&s;erved in their health and in their property by this devoted animal's &s;ervices. The midnight robber is kept at a di&s;tance; the in&s;idious thief is often de|tected; the healthful chace repairs many a worn con&s;titution; and the poor man finds in his dog a willing a&s;&s;i&s;tant, eager to le&s;&s;en his toil, and content with the &s;malle&s;t retribution.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A DOG, &s;ays one of the Engli&s;h poets," is an hone&s;t creature, and I am a friend to dogs."</Q> Of all the bea&s;ts that graze the lawn or hunt the fore&s;t, a dog is the only animal that, leaving his fellows, attempts to cultivate the friend&s;hip of man; to man he looks, in all his nece&s;&s;ities, with a &s;peaking eye for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; exerts, for him, all the little &s;ervice in his power with chearfulne&s;s and plea&s;ure; for him bears famine and fatigue with patience and re&s;ignation; no injuries can abate his fidelity; no di&s;tre&s;s induce him to for&s;ake his benefactor;

<P>AGE, that le&s;&s;ens the enjoyment of life, encrea&s;es our de&s;ire of living.

<P>STRANGE contradiction in our nature, and to which even the wi&s;e are liable! If I &s;hould judge of that part of life which lies before me by that which I have already &s;een, the pro&s;pect is hideous. Experience tells me, that my pa&s;t enjoyments have brought no real felicity; and &s;en&s;ation a&s;&s;ures me, that tho&s;e I have felt are &s;tronger than tho&s;e which are yet to come. Yet experience and &s;en&s;ation in vain per&s;uade; hope, more powerful than either, dre&s;&s;es out the di&s;tant pro&s;pect in fancied beauty, &s;ome happine&s;s, in long per&s;pective, &s;till beckons me

<HEAD>ESSAY XV.</HEAD>
<P>FOREIGNERS ob&s;erve that there are no ladies in the world more beautiful, or more ill dre&s;&s;ed, than tho&s;e of England. Our country-women have been compared to tho&s;e pictures, where the face is the work of a Ra|phael; but the draperies thrown out by &s;ome empty pretender, de&s;titute of ta&s;te, and entirely unacquainted with de&s;ign.</P>
<P>IF I were a poet, I might ob&s;erve, on this occa&s;ion, that &s;o much beauty, &s;et off with all the advantages of dre&s;s, would be too powerful an antagoni&s;t for the oppo&s;ite &s;ex; and therefore it was wi&s;ely ordered, that our ladies &s;hould want ta&s;te, le&s;t their admirers &s;hould entirely want rea&s;on.</P>
<P>BUT to confe&s;s a truth, I do not find they have a greater aver&s;ion to fine cloaths than the women of any other country what&s;oever. I can't fancy that a &s;hopkeeper's wife in Cheap|&s;ide has a greater tenderne&s;s for the fortune of her hu&s;band than a citizen's wife in Paris; or
<PB N="118" REF="127">
that mi&s;s in a boarding-&s;chool is more an oeco|nomi&s;t in dre&s;s than mademoi&s;elle in a nun|nery.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH Paris may be accounted the &s;oil in which almo&s;t every fa&s;hion takes its ri&s;e, its influence is never &s;o general there as with us. They &s;tudy there the happy method of uniting grace and fa&s;hion, and never excu&s;e a woman for being aukwardly dre&s;&s;ed, by &s;aying her cloaths are in the mode. A French woman is a perfect architect in dre&s;s; &s;he never, with Gothic ignorance, mixes the orders; &s;he never tricks out a &s;quabby Doric &s;hape with Corin|thian finery; or, to &s;peak without metaphor, &s;he conforms to general fa&s;hion only when it happens not to be repugnant to private beauty.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h ladies, on the contrary, &s;eem to have no other &s;tandard of grace but the run of the town. If fa&s;hion gives the word, every di&s;tinction of beauty, complexion, or &s;tatute, cea&s;es. Sweeping trains, Pru&s;&s;ian bonnets, and trollopees, as like each other as if cut from the &s;ame piece, level all to one &s;tandard. The Mall, the gardens and playhou&s;es, are filled with ladies in uniform; and their whole ap|pearance &s;hews as little variety or ta&s;te as if
<PB N="119" REF="128">
their cloaths were be&s;poke by the colonel of a marching regiment, or fancied by the arti&s;t who dre&s;&s;es the three battalions of guards.</P>
<P>BUT not only the ladies of every &s;hape and complexion, but of every age too, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this unaccountable pa&s;&s;ion for levelling all di&s;tinction in dre&s;s. The lady of no quality travels fa&s;t behind the lady of &s;ome quality; and a woman of &s;ixty is as gaudy as her grand|daughter. A friend of mine, a good-natured old man, amu&s;ed me, the other day, with an account of his journey to the Mall. It &s;eems, in his walk thither, he, for &s;ome time, followed a lady who, as he thought by her dre&s;s, was a girl of fifteen. It was airy, elegant, and youth|ful. My old friend had called up all his poetry on this occa&s;ion, and fancied twenty cupids prepared for execution in every folding of her white negligee. He had prepared his imagina|tion for an angel's face; but what was his mor|tification to find that the imaginary godde&s;s was no other than his cou&s;in Hannah, &s;ome years older than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT to give it in his own words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"After the tran&s;ports of our fir&s;t &s;alute," &s;aid he,

"were over, I could not avoid running my eye over her whole appearance. Her gown was of cambrick, cut &s;hort before, in order to di&s;cover an high-heeled &s;hoe, which was buckled almo&s;t at the toe. Her cap con&s;i&s;ted of a few bits of cambrick, and flowers of painted paper &s;tuck on one &s;ide of her head. Her bo&s;om, that had felt no hand but the hand of time the&s;e twenty years, ro&s;e, &s;u|ing to be pre&s;&s;ed. I could, indeed, have wi&s;hed her more than an handkerchief of Paris net to &s;hade her beauties; for, as Ta&s;&s;o &s;ays of the ro&s;e-bud, 'Quanto &s;i no&s;tra men tanto epiu bella.' A female brea&s;t is gene|rally thought mo&s;t beautiful as it is more &s;paringly di&s;covered."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"AS my cou&s;in had not put on all this finery for nothing, &s;he was at that time &s;allying out to the Park, when I had overtaken her. Per|ceiving, however, that I had on my be&s;t wig, &s;he offered, if I would '&s;quire her there, to &s;end home the footman. Though I trembled for our reception in public, yet I could not, with any civility, refu&s;e; &s;o, to be as gallant as po&s;&s;ible, I took her hand in my arm, and thus we marched on together."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="130">WHEN we made our entry at the Park, two antiquated figures, &s;o polite and &s;o tender, &s;oon attracted the eyes of the company. As we made our way among crowds who were out to &s;hew their finery as well as we, wherever we came, I perceived we brought good-humour with us. The polite could not forbear &s;mil|ing, and the vulgar bur&s;t out into a hor&s;e-laugh at our grote&s;que figures. Cou&s;in Hannah, who was perfectly con&s;cious of the rectitude of her own appearance, attributed all this mirth to the oddity of mine; while I as cordially placed the whole to her account. Thus, from being two of the be&s;t-natured creatures alive, before we got half way up the Mall, we both began to grow peevi&s;h, and, like two mice on a &s;tring, endeavoured to revenge the impertinence of others upon our&s;elves. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am amazed, cou&s;in Jeffery," &s;ays mi&s;s, "that I can never get you to dre&s;s like a Chri&s;tian.

I hate tho&s;e odious muffs."</Q> I could have patiently borne a critici&s;m on all the re&s;t of my equipage; but, as I had always a peculiar veneration for my muff, I could not forbear being piqued a little; and throwing my eyes with a &s;piteful air

on her bo&s;om, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I could heartily wi&s;h, madam," replied I, "that, for your &s;ake, my muff was cut into a tippet."</Q></P>
<P>AS my cou&s;in, by this time, was grown hear|tily a&s;hamed of her gentleman-u&s;her, and as I was never very fond of any kind of exhibition my&s;elf, it was mutually agreed to retire for a while to one of the &s;eats, and from that retreat remark on others as freely as they had remarked on us.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;eated we continued &s;ilent for &s;ome time, employed in very different &s;peculations. I regarded the whole company, now pa&s;&s;ing in review before me, as drawn out merely for my amu&s;ement. For my entertainment the beauty had, all that morning, been improving her charms; the beau had put on lace, and the young doctor a big wig, merely to plea&s;e me. But quite different were the &s;entiments or cou|&s;in Hannah; &s;he regarded every well-dre&s;&s;ed woman as a victorious rival; hated every face that &s;eemed dre&s;&s;ed in good-humour, or wore the appearance of greater happine&s;s than her own. I perceived her unea&s;ine&s;s, and attempted to le&s;&s;en it, by ob&s;erving that there was no com|pany in the Park to day. To this &s;he readily

That is Mi&s;s Biddy Evergreen. Mi&s;s Biddy, it &s;eems, has money; and as &s;he con&s;iders that money was never &s;o &s;carce as it is now, &s;he &s;eems re&s;olved to keep what &s;he has to her&s;elf.

Thus &s;he &s;pends the whole week in a clo&s;e chamber, with no other company but her monkey, her apothecary and cat; and comes dre&s;&s;ed out to the Park every Sunday, to &s;hew her airs, to get new lovers, to catch a new cold, and to make new work for the doctor."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="133"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"THERE goes Mrs. Roundabout, I mean the fat lady in the lute&s;tring trollopee. Be|tween you and I, &s;he is but a cutler's wife.

For all her airs, it goes to her hu&s;band's heart to &s;ee four yards of good lute&s;tring wearing again&s;t the ground, like one of his knives on a grind&s;tone. To &s;peak my mind, cou&s;in Jeffery, I never liked tho&s;e tails; for, &s;uppo&s;e a young fellow &s;hould be rude, and the lady &s;hould offer to &s;tep back in the fright, in&s;tead of retiring, &s;he treads upon her train, and falls fairly on her back; and then you know, cou&s;in,&mdash; her cloaths may be &s;poiled.</Q></P>

<P>WHERE Tauris lifts its head above the &s;torm, and pre&s;ents nothing to the &s;ight of the di&s;tant traveller, but a pro&s;pect of nodding rocks, falling torrents, and all the va|riety of tremendous nature; on the bleak bo|&s;om of this frightful mountain, &s;ecluded from &s;ociety, and dete&s;ting the ways, of men, lived A&s;em the Manhater.</P>
<P>ASEM had &s;pent his youth with men; had &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ared in their amu&s;ements; and had been taught to love his fellow-creatures with the mo&s;t ardent affection: but, from the tenderne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, he exhau&s;ted all his fortune in relieving the wants of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. The petitioner never &s;ued in vain; the weary tra|veller never pa&s;&s;ed his door; he only de&s;i&s;ted from doing good when he had no longer the power of relieving.</P>
<P>FROM a fortune thus &s;pent in benevolence, he expected a grateful return from tho&s;e he had
<PB N="127" REF="136">
formerly relieved; and made his application with confidence of redre&s;s: the ungrateful world &s;oon grew weary of his importunity; for pity is but a &s;hort-lived pa&s;&s;ion. He &s;oon, therefore, began to view mankind in a very different light from that in which he had before behold them: he perceived a thou&s;and vices he had never before &s;u&s;pected to exi&s;t: where|ever he turned, ingratitude, di&s;&s;imulation and treachery, contributed to increa&s;e his dete&s;tation of them. Re&s;olved therefore to continue no longer in a world which he hated, and which repaid his dete&s;tation with contempt, he retired to this region of &s;terility, in order to brood over his re&s;entment in &s;olitude, and conver&s;e with the only hone&s;t heart he knew; namely, with his own.</P>
<P>A CAVE was his only &s;helter from the in|clemency of the weather; fruits gathered with difficulty from the mountain's &s;ide, his only food; and his drink was fetched with danger and toil from the headlong torrent. In this manner he lived, &s;eque&s;tered from &s;ociety, pa&s;&s;ing the hours in meditation, and &s;ometimes exulting that he was able to live independently of his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="137">AT the foot of the mountain, an exten&s;ive lake di&s;played its gla&s;&s;y bo&s;om; reflecting, on its broad &s;urface, the impending horrors of the mountain.

Every part of the univer&s;e is beautiful, ju&s;t, and wi&s;e, but man: vile man is a &s;oleci&s;m in na|ture; the only mon&s;ter in the creation. Tempe&s;ts and whirlwinds have their u&s;e; but vicious ungrateful man is a blot in the fair page of univer&s;al beauty. Why was I born of that dete&s;ted &s;pecies, who&s;e vices are almo&s;t a reproach to the wi&s;dom of the divine Creator! Were men entirely free from vice, all would be uniformity, harmony, and or|der. A world of moral rectitude, &s;hould be

<P>IT is allowed on all hands, that our Engli&s;h divines receive a more liberal education, and improve that education, by frequent &s;tudy, more than any others of this reverend profe&s;|&s;ion in Europe. In general, al&s;o, it may be ob&s;erved, that a greater degree of gentility is affixed to the character of a &s;tudent in England than el&s;ewhere; by which means our clergy have an opportunity of &s;eeing better company while young, and of &s;ooner wearing off tho&s;e prejudices which they are apt to imbibe even in the be&s;t regulated univer&s;ities, and which may be ju&s;tly termed the vulgar errors of the wi&s;e.</P>
<P>YET, with all the&s;e advantages, it is very obvious, that the clergy are no where &s;o little thought of, by the populace, as here; and, though our divines are foremo&s;t, with re&s;pect to abilities, yet they are found la&s;t in the ef|fects of their mini&s;try; the vulgar, in gene|ral, appearing no way impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of religious duty. I am not for whining at
<PB N="141" REF="150">
the depravity of the times, or for endeavouring to paint a pro&s;pect more gloomy than in nature; but certain it is, no per&s;on who has travelled will contradict me, when I aver, that the lower orders of mankind, in other countries, te&s;tify, on every occa&s;ion, the profounde&s;t awe of religion; while in England they are &s;carcely awakened into a &s;en&s;e of its duties, even in cir|cum&s;tances of the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;&s;olute and fearle&s;s conduct foreign|ers are apt to attribute to climate and con&s;titu|tion; may not the vulgar, being pretty much neglected in our exhortations from the pulpit, be a con&s;piring cau&s;e? Our divines &s;eldom &s;toop to their mean capacities; and they who want in&s;truction mo&s;t, find lea&s;t in our religi|ous a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may become of the higher orders of mankind, who are generally po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of collateral motives to virtue, the vul|gar &s;hould be particularly regarded, who&s;e be|haviour in civil life, is totally hinged upon their hopes and fears. Tho&s;e who con&s;titute the ba&s;is of the great fabrick of &s;ociety, &s;hould be particularly regarded; for, in policy as in architecture, ruin is mo&s;t fatal when it begins from the bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="151">MEN of real &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding prefer a prudent mediocrity to a precarious popularity; and, fearing to outdo their duty, leave it half done. Their di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit are generally dry, methodical, and unaffecting; delivered with the mo&s;t in&s;ipid calmne&s;s, in&s;o|much, that, &s;hould the peaceful preacher lift his head over the cu&s;hion, which alone he &s;eems to addre&s;s, he might di&s;cover his audi|ence, in&s;tead of being awakened to remor&s;e, actually &s;leeping over his methodical and la|boured compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>THIS method of preaching is, however, by &s;ome called an addre&s;s to rea&s;on, and not to to the pa&s;&s;ions; this is &s;tiled the making of converts from conviction: but &s;uch are indif|ferently acquainted with human nature, who are not &s;en&s;ible, that men &s;eldom rea&s;on about their debaucheries till they are committed; rea&s;on is but a weak antagoni&s;t when head|long pa&s;&s;ion dictates; in all &s;uch ca&s;es we &s;hould arm one pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t another; it is with the human mind as in nature, from the mixture of two oppo&s;ites the re&s;ult is mo&s;t fre|quently neutral tranquility. Tho&s;e who at|tempt to rea&s;on us out of our follies, begin at the wrong end, &s;ince the attempt naturally pre|&s;uppo&s;es
<PB N="143" REF="152">
us capable of rea&s;on; but to be made capable of this, is one great point of the cure.</P>
<P>THERE are but few talents requi&s;ite to be|come a popular preacher, for the people are ea&s;ily plea&s;ed if they perceive any endeavours in the orator to plea&s;e them; the meane&s;t quali|fications will work this effect, if the preacher &s;incerely &s;ets about it. Perhaps little, indeed very little more is required, than &s;incerity and a&s;&s;urance; and a becoming &s;incerity is al|ways certain of producing a becoming a&s;&s;u|rance. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Si vis me fiere, dolendum e&s;t primum tibi ip&s;i,"</Q> is &s;o trite a quotation, that it al|mo&s;t demands an apology to repeat it; yet, though all allow the ju&s;tice of the remark, how few do we find put it in practice; our orators, with the mo&s;t faulty ba&s;hfulne&s;s, &s;eem impre&s;&s;ed rather with an awe of their audience than with a ju&s;t re&s;pect for the truths they are about to deliver; they, of all profe&s;&s;ions, &s;eem the mo&s;t ba&s;hful, who have the greate&s;t right to glory in their commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE French preachers generally a&s;&s;ume all that dignity which becomes men who are am|ba&s;&s;adors from Chri&s;t: the Engli&s;h divines, like erroneous envoys, &s;eem more &s;ollicitous not to

offend the court to which they are &s;ent, than to drive home the intere&s;ts of their employer. The bi&s;hop of Ma&s;&s;illon, in the fir&s;t &s;ermon he ever preached, found the whole audience, upon his getting into the pulpit, in a di&s;po&s;ition no way favourable to his intentions; their nods, whi&s;pers, or drow&s;y behaviour, &s;hewed him that there was no great profit to be expected from his &s;owing in a &s;oil to improper; how|ever, he &s;oon changed the di&s;po&s;ition of his au|dience by his manner of beginning: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If," &s;ays he, "a cau&s;e, the mo&s;t important that could be conceived, were to be tried at the bar before qualified judges; if this cau&s;e in|tere&s;ted our&s;elves in particular; if the eyes of the whole kingdom were fixed upon the event; if the mo&s;t eminent council were em|ployed on both &s;ides; and if we had heard from our infancy of this yet undetermined trial; would you not all &s;it with due atten|tion, and warm expectation, to the plead|ings on each &s;ide?

<P>THE &s;tile, the abruptne&s;s of a beginning like this, in the clo&s;et would appear ab&s;urd; but in the pulpit it is attended with the mo&s;t la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions: that &s;tile which, in the clo&s;et, might ju&s;tly be called flim&s;y, &s;eems the true mode of eloquence here. I never read a fine compo&s;ition, under the title of a &s;ermon, that I do not think the author has mi&s;called his piece; for the talents to be u&s;ed in writing well, in|tirely differ from tho&s;e of &s;peaking well. The qualifications for &s;peaking, as has been already ob&s;erved, are ea&s;ily acquired; they are accom|pli&s;hments which may be taken up by every candidate who will be at the pains of &s;tooping. Impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the truths he is about to deliver, a preacher di&s;regards the applau&s;e or
<PB N="146" REF="155">
the contempt of his audience, and he in&s;en&s;ibly a&s;&s;umes a ju&s;t and manly &s;incerity. With this talent alone we &s;ee what crowds are drawn around enthu&s;ia&s;ts, even de&s;titute of common|&s;en&s;e; what numbers converted to Chri&s;tianity. Folly may &s;ometimes &s;et an example for wi&s;dom to practi&s;e, and our regular divines may borrow in&s;truction from even methodi&s;ts, who go their circuits and preach prizes among the populace. Even Whitfield may be placed as a model to &s;ome of our young divines; let them join to their own good &s;en&s;e his earne&s;t manner of de|livery.</P>
<P>IT will be perhaps objected, that, by con|fining the excellencies of a preacher to proper a&s;&s;urance, earne&s;tne&s;s, and openne&s;s of &s;tyle, I make the qualifications too trifling for e&s;tima|tion: there will be &s;omething called oratory brought up on this occa&s;ion; action, attitude, grace, elocution, may be repeated as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to compleat the character; but let us not be deceived; common-&s;en&s;e is &s;eldom &s;wayed by fine tones, mu&s;ical periods, ju&s;t at|titudes, or the di&s;play of a white handkerchief; oratorial behaviour, except in very able hands indeed, generally &s;inks into aukward and paltry affectation.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="156">IT mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, however, that the&s;e rules are calculated only for him who would in|&s;truct the vulgar, who &s;tand in mo&s;t need of in|&s;truction; to addre&s;s philo&s;ophers, and to ob|tain the character of a polite preacher among the polite&mdash;a much more u&s;ele&s;s, though more &s;ought-for character&mdash;requires a different me|thod of proceeding. All I &s;hall ob&s;erve on this head is, to entreat the polemic divine, in his controver&s;y with the Dei&s;ts, to act rather of|fen&s;ively than to defend; to pu&s;h home the grounds of his belief, and the impracticability of theirs, rather than to &s;pend time in &s;olving the objections of every opponent. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is ten to one," &s;ays a late writer on the art of war, "but that the a&s;&s;ailant who attacks the enemy in his trenches, is always victorious."</Q></P>
<P>YET, upon the whole, our clergy might employ them&s;elves more to the benefit of &s;ociety, by declining all controver&s;y, than by exhibiting even the profounde&s;t &s;kill in polemic di&s;putes; their conte&s;ts with each other often turn on &s;peculative trifles; and their di&s;putes with the Dei&s;ts are almo&s;t at an end &s;ince they can have no more than victory, and that they are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, as their antagoni&s;ts have been driven into a confe&s;&s;ion of the nece&s;&s;ity of reve|lation,

<P>I HAVE frequently been amazed at the ig|norance of almo&s;t all the European travel|ers, who have penetrated any con&s;iderable way ea&s;tward into A&s;ia. They have all been influ|enced either by motives of commerce or piety, and their accounts are &s;uch as might rea&s;onably be expected from men of a very narrow or very prejudiced education, the dictates of &s;uper&s;ti|tion, or the re&s;ult of ignorance. Is it not &s;ur|pri&s;ing, that, of &s;uch a variety of adventurers, not one &s;ingle philo&s;opher &s;hould be found among the number? For, as to the travels of Gemelli, the learned are long agreed that the whole is but an impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;carce any country, how rude or uncultivated &s;oever, where the inhabitants are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome peculiar &s;ecrets, either in nature or art, which might be tran&s;planted with &s;ucce&s;s: thus, for in&s;tance, in Siberian Tartary, the natives extract a &s;trong &s;pirit from milk, which is a &s;ecret probably unknown to
<PB N="150" REF="159">
the chymi&s;ts of Europe. In the mo&s;t &s;avage parts of India they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ecret of dying vegetable &s;ub&s;tances &s;carlet, and likewi&s;e that of refining lead into a metal, which, for hardne&s;s and colour, is little inferior to &s;ilver; not one of which &s;ecrets but would, in Europe, make a man's fortune. The power of the A&s;i|atics in producing winds, or bringing down rain, the Europeans are apt to treat as fabulous, becau&s;e they have no in&s;tances of the like nature among them&s;elves; but they would have treated the &s;ecrets of gunpowder, and the mariner's compa&s;s, in the &s;ame manner, had they been told the Chine&s;e u&s;ed &s;uch arts before the in|vention was common with them&s;elves at home.</P>
<P>OF all the Engli&s;h philo&s;ophers, I mo&s;t re|verence Bacon, that great and hardy genius: he it is who, undaunted by the &s;eeming diffi|culties that oppo&s;e, prompts human curio&s;ity to examine every part of nature; and even ex|horts man to try whether he cannot &s;ubject the tempe&s;t, the thunder, and even earthquakes, to human controul. Oh! had a man of his dar|ing &s;pirit, of his genius, penetration, and learn|ing, travelled to tho&s;e countries which have been vi&s;ited only by the &s;uper&s;titious and mer|cenary,
<PB N="151" REF="160">
what might not mankind expect! How would he enlighten the regions to which he tra|velled! and what a variety of knowledge and u&s;eful improvement would he not bring back in exchange!</P>
<P>THERE is probably no country &s;o barbarous, that would not di&s;clo&s;e all it knew, if it re|ceived equivalent information; and I am apt to think, that a per&s;on, who was ready to give more knowledge than he received, would be welcome wherever he came. All his care in travelling &s;hould only be to &s;uit his intellectual banquet to the people with whom he conver&s;ed: he &s;hould not attempt to teach the unlettered Tartar a&s;tronomy, nor yet in&s;truct the polite Chine&s;e in the arts of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: he &s;hould endeavour to improve the barbarian in the &s;e|crets of living comfortably; and the inhabitant of a more refined country in the &s;peculative plea&s;ures of &s;cience. How much more nobly would a philo&s;opher, thus employed, &s;pend his time, than by &s;itting at home, earne&s;tly intent upon adding one &s;tar more to his catalogue, or one mon&s;ter more to his collection; or &s;till, if po&s;&s;ible, more triflingly &s;edulous in the incate|nation of fleas, or the &s;culpture of cherry-&s;tones.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="161">I NEVER con&s;ider this &s;ubject, without be|ing &s;urpri&s;ed that none of tho&s;e &s;ocieties, &s;o laudably e&s;tabli&s;hed in England for the promo|tion of arts and learning, have ever thought of &s;ending one of their members into the mo&s;t ea&s;tern parts of A&s;ia, to make what di&s;coveries he was able. To be convinced of the utility of &s;uch an undertaking, let them but read the relations of their own travellers. It will there be found, that they are as often deceived them|&s;elves, as they attempt to deceive others. The merchants tell us, perhaps, the price of differ|ent commodities, the methods of bailing them up, and the propere&s;t manner for an European to pre&s;erve his health in the country. The mi&s;&s;ioner, on the other hand, informs us with what plea&s;ure the country to which he was &s;ent embraced Chri&s;tianity, and the numbers he converted; what methods he took to keep Lent in a region where there was no fi&s;h, or the &s;hifts be made to celebrate the rites of his reli|gion, in places where there was neither bread nor wine: &s;uch accounts, with the u&s;ual ap|pendage of marriages and funerals, in&s;criptions, rivers, and mountains, make up the whole of an European traveller's diary; but as to all the &s;ecrets of which the inhabitants are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, tho&s;e are univer&s;ally attributed to magic; and

when the traveller can give no other account of the wonders he &s;ees performed, he very con|tentedly a&s;cribes them to the devil.</P>
<P>IT was an u&s;ual ob&s;ervation of Boyle, the Engli&s;h chymi&s;t, that, if every arti&s;t would but di&s;cover what new ob&s;ervations occurred to him in the exerci&s;e of his trade, philo&s;ophy would thence gain innumerable improvements. It may be ob&s;erved, with &s;till greater ju&s;tice, that, if the u&s;eful knowledge of every country, how&s;oever barbarous, was gleaned by a judici|ous ob&s;erver, the advantages would be ine&s;ti|mable. Are there not, even in Europe, many u&s;eful inventions, known or practi&s;ed but in one place? Their in&s;trument, as an example, for cutting down corn in Germany, is much more handy and expeditious, in my opinion, than the &s;ickle u&s;ed in England. The cheap and expeditious manner of making vinegar, without previous fermentation, is known only in a part of France. If &s;uch di&s;coveries there|fore remain &s;till to be known at home, what funds of knowledge might not be collected in countries yet unexplored, or only pa&s;&s;ed through by ignorant travellers in ha&s;ty cara|vans?</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="163">THE caution with which foreigners are re|ceived in A&s;ia, may be alledged as an objection to &s;uch a de&s;ign. But how readily have &s;everal European merchants found admi&s;&s;ion into re|gions the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious, under the character of Sanjapins, or northern pilgrims?

<P>TO &s;end out a traveller properly qualified for the&s;e purpo&s;es, might be an object of national concern: it would, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, repair the breaches made by ambition; and might &s;hew that there were &s;till &s;ome who boa&s;ted a greater name than that of patriots, who pro|fe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves lovers of men.</P>
<P>THE only difficulty would remain in chu&s;ing a proper per&s;on for &s;o arduous an enterprize.

with men. He &s;hould be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an enthu&s;ia&s;t to the de&s;ign; fond of travelling, from a rapid imagination, and an innate love of change; furni&s;hed with a body capable of &s;u&s;taining every fatigue, and a heart not ea&s;ily terrified at danger.</P>

<P>THE improvements we make in mental acquirements, only render us each day more &s;en&s;ible of the defects of our con&s;titution: with this in view, therefore, let us often recur to the amu&s;ements of youth; endeavour to for|get age and wi&s;dom, and, as far as innocence goes, be as much a boy as the be&s;t of them.</P>
<P>LET idle declaimers mourn over the degene|racy of the age; but, in my opinion, every age is the &s;ame. This I am &s;ure of, that man, in every &s;ea&s;on, is a poor fretful being, with no other means to e&s;cape the calamities of the times but by endeavouring to forget them; for, if he attempts to re&s;i&s;t, he is certainly undone. If I feel poverty and pain, I am not &s;o hardy as to quarrel with the executioner, even while un|der correction: I find my&s;elf no way di&s;po&s;ed to make fine &s;peeches, while I am making wry faces. In a word, let me drink when the fit is on, to make me in&s;en&s;ible; and drink when it is over, for joy that I feel pain no longer.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="166">THE character of old Fal&s;taff, even with all his faults, gives me more con&s;olation than the mo&s;t &s;tudied efforts of wi&s;dom: I here behold an agreeable old fellow, forgetting age, and &s;hewing me the way to be young at &s;ixty-five. Sure I am well able to be as merry, though not &s;o comical, as he.&mdash;Is it not in my power to have, though not &s;o much wit, at lea&s;t as much vivacity?&mdash;Age, care, wi&s;dom, reflection, be gone&mdash;I give you to the winds. Let's have t'other bottle: here's to the memory of Shake|&s;pear, Fal&s;taff, and all the merry men of Ea&s;t-cheap.</P>
<P>SUCH were the reflections that naturally aro&s;e while I &s;at at the Boar's head tavern, &s;till kept at Ea&s;t-cheap. Here, by a plea&s;ant fire, in the very room where old Sir John Fal&s;taff cracked his jokes, in the very chair which was &s;ometimes honoured by prince Henry, and &s;ome|times polluted by his immoral merry compa|nions, I &s;at and ruminated on the follies of youth; wi&s;hed to be young again; but was re|&s;olved to make the be&s;t of life while it la&s;ted, and now and then compared pa&s;t and pre&s;ent times together. I con&s;idered my&s;elf as the only living repre&s;entative of the old knight, and tran&s;ported my imagination back to the times
<PB N="158" REF="167">
when the prince and he gave life to the revel, and made even debauchery not di&s;gu&s;ting. The room al&s;o con&s;pired to throw my reflections back into antiquity: the oak floor, the Gothic win|dows, and the ponderous chimney-piece, had long with&s;tood the tooth of time: the watch|man had gone twelve: my companions had all &s;tolen off, and none now remained with me but the landlord. From him I could have wi&s;hed to know the hi&s;tory of a tavern that had &s;uch a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cu&s;tomers: I could not help thinking that an account of this kind would be a plea&s;ing contra&s;t of the manners of different ages; but my landlord could give me no infor|mation. He continued to doze and &s;ot, and tell a tedious &s;tory, as mo&s;t other landlords u&s;ually do; and, though he &s;aid nothing, yet was never &s;ilent: one good joke followed ano|ther good joke; and the be&s;t joke of all was ge|nerally begun towards ths end of a bottle. I found at la&s;t, however, his wine and his con|ver&s;ation operate by degrees: he in&s;en&s;ibly be|gan to alter his appearance. His cravat &s;eemed quilled into a ruff, and his breeches &s;welled out into a fardingale. I now fancied him changing &s;exes: and, as my eyes began to clo&s;e in &s;lum|ber, I imagined my fat landlord actually con|verted into as fat a landlady. However, &s;leep
<PB N="159" REF="168">
made but few changes in my &s;ituation: the ta|vern, the apartment and the table, continued as before; nothing &s;uffered mutation but my ho&s;t, who was fairly altered into a gentlewoman, whom I knew to be dame Quickly, mi&s;tre&s;s of this tavern in the days of Sir John; and the li|quor we were drinking, which &s;eemed con|verted into &s;ack and &s;ugar.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"MY dear Mrs. Quickly," cried I (for I knew her perfectly well at fir&s;t &s;ight) "I am heartily glad to &s;ee you. How have you left Fal&s;taff, Pi&s;tol, and the re&s;t of our friends below &s;tairs? Brave and hearty, I hope?"</Q> In good &s;ooth, replied &s;he, he did de&s;erve to live for ever; but he maketh foul work on't where he hath flitted. Queen Pro&s;erpine and he have quarrelled for his attempting a rape up|on her divinity; and were it not that &s;he &s;till had bowels of compa&s;&s;ion, it more than &s;eems probable he might have been now &s;prawling in Tartarus.</P>
<P>I NOW found that &s;pirits &s;till pre&s;erve the frailties of the fle&s;h; and that, according to the laws of crit&s;ci&s;m and dreaming, gho&s;ts have been known to be guilty of even more than platonic affection: wherefore, as I found her
<PB N="160" REF="169">
too much moved on &s;uch a topic to proceed, I was re&s;olved to change the &s;ubject; and de|&s;iring &s;he would pledge me in a bumper, ob|&s;erved, with a &s;igh, that our &s;ack was nothing now to what it was in former days: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, Mrs. Quickly, tho&s;e were merry times when you drew &s;ack for prince Henry: men were twice as &s;trong, and twice as wi&s;e, and much braver, and ten thou&s;and times more chari|table than now. Tho&s;e were the times! The battle of Agincourt was a victory in|deed! Ever &s;ince that we have only been degenerating; and I have lived to &s;ee the day when drinking is no longer fa&s;hionable. When men wear clean &s;hirts, and women &s;hew their necks and arms, all are degene|rated, Mrs. Quickly; and we &s;hall probably, in another century, be frittered away into beaus or monkeys. Had you been on earth to &s;ee what I have &s;een, it would congeal all the blood in your body (your &s;oul, I mean.) Why, our very nobility now have the into|lerable arrogance, in &s;pite of what is every day remon&s;trated from the pre&s;s; our very nobility, I &s;ay, have the a&s;&s;urance to fre|quent a&s;&s;emblies, and pre&s;ume to be as merry as the vulgar. See, my very friends have &s;carce manhood enough to &s;it to it till

<P>OBSERVE this apartment, interrupted my companion; of neat device and excellent work|man&s;hip&mdash;In this room I have lived, child, wo|man and gho&s;t, more than three hundred years: I am ordered by Pluto to keep an annual regi|&s;ter of every tran&s;action that pa&s;&s;eth here; and I have whilhom compiled three hundred tomes, which eft&s;oons may be &s;ubmitted to thy re|gards. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"None of your whilhoms or eft&s;oons's, Mrs. Quickly, if you plea&s;e," I replied; "I know you can talk every whit as well as I can; for, as you have lived here &s;o long, it is but natural to &s;uppo&s;e you &s;hould learn the conver&s;ation of the company. Believe me, dame, at be&s;t, you have neither too much &s;en&s;e, or too much language, to &s;pare; &s;o give me both as well as you can: but, fir&s;t, my &s;ervice to you: old women &s;hould water their clay a little now and then; and now to your &s;tory."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="171">THE &s;tory of my own adventures, replied the vi&s;ion, is but &s;hort and un&s;atisfactory; for, believe me, Mr. Rigmarole, believe me, a wo|man with a butt of &s;ack at her elbow, is never long-lived. Sir John's death afflicted me to &s;uch a degree, that I &s;incerely believe, to drown &s;orrow, I drank more liquor my&s;elf than I drew for my cu&s;tomers: my grief was &s;incere, and the &s;ack was excellent. The prior of a neigh|bouring convent (for our priors then had as much power as a Middle&s;ex ju&s;tice now) he, I &s;ay, it was who gave me a licence for keeping a di&s;orderly hou&s;e; upon condition, that I &s;hould never make hard bargains with the cler|gy, that he &s;hould have a bottle of &s;ack every morning, and the liberty of confe&s;&s;ing which of my girls he thought proper in private every night. I had continued, for &s;everal years, to pay this tribute; and he, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, continued as rigorou&s;ly to exact it. I grew old in&s;en&s;ibly; my cu&s;tomers continued, however, to compliment my looks while I was by, but I could hear them &s;ay I was wearing when my back was turned. The prior, however, &s;till was con&s;tant, and &s;o were half his convent: but one fatal morning he mi&s;&s;ed the u&s;ual be|verage; for I had incautiou&s;ly drank over night the la&s;t bottle my&s;elf. What will you have
<PB N="163" REF="172">
on't?&mdash;The very next day Doll Tear&s;heet and I were &s;ent to the hou&s;e of correction, and ac|cu&s;ed of keeping a low bawdy-hou&s;e. In &s;hort, we were &s;o well purified there with &s;tripes, mortification and penance, that we were after|wards utterly unfit for worldly conver&s;ation: though &s;ack would have killed me, had I &s;tuck to it, yet I &s;oon died for want of a drop of &s;ome|thing comfortable, and fairly left my body to the care of the beadle.</P>
<P>SUCH is my own hi&s;tory; but that of the tavern, where I have ever &s;ince been &s;tationed, affords greater variety. In the hi&s;tory of this, which is one of the olde&s;t in London, you may view the different manners, plea&s;ures, and fol|lies, of men at different periods. You will find mankind neither better nor wor&s;e now than formerly: the vices of an uncivilized peo|ple are generally more dete&s;table, though not &s;o frequent, as tho&s;e in polite &s;ociety. It is the &s;ame luxury which formerly &s;tuffed your alderman with plumb-porridge, and now crams him with turtle. It is the &s;ame low ambition that formerly induced a courtier to give up his religion to plea&s;e his king, and now per&s;uades him to give up his con&s;cience to plea&s;e his mi|ni&s;ter. It is the &s;ame vanity that formerly &s;tained our ladies cheeks and necks with woad,
<PB N="164" REF="173">
and now paints them with carmine. Your an|tient Briton formerly powdered his hair with red earth, like brick-du&s;t, in order to appear fright|ful: your modern Briton cuts his hair on the crown, and plai&s;ters it with hogs-lard and flour; and this to make him look killing. It is the &s;ame vanity, the &s;ame folly, and the &s;ame vice, only appearing different, as viewed through the gla&s;s of fa&s;hion. In a word, all mankind are a&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"SURE the woman is dreaming," inter|rupted I. "None of your reflections, Mrs. Quickly, if you love me; they only give me the &s;pleen. Tell me your hi&s;tory at once. I love &s;tories, but hate rea&s;oning."</Q></P>
<P>IF you plea&s;e then, Sir, returned my com|panion, I'll read you an ab&s;tract, which I made of the three hundred volumes I mentioned ju&s;t now.</P>
<P>MY body was no &s;ooner laid in the du&s;t, than the prior and &s;everal of his convent came to purify the tavern from the pollutions with which they &s;aid I had filled it. Ma&s;&s;es were &s;aid in every room, reliques were expo&s;ed up|on every piece of furniture, and the whole hou&s;e wa&s;hed with a deluge of holy-water. My
<PB N="165" REF="174">
habitation was &s;oon converted into a mona&s;tery; in&s;tead of cu&s;tomers now applying for &s;ack and &s;ugar, my rooms were crowded with images, reliques, &s;aints, whores, and friars. In&s;tead of being a &s;cene of occa&s;ional debauchery, it was now filled with continual lewdne&s;s. The prior led the fa&s;hion, and the whole convent imitated his pious example. Matrons came hither to confe&s;s their &s;ins, and to commit new. Virgins came hither who &s;eldom went virgins away. Nor was this a convent pecu|liarly wicked; every convent at that period was equally fond of plea&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and gave a boundle&s;s loo&s;e to appetite. The laws allowed it; each prie&s;t had a right to a favourite companion, and a power of di&s;carding her as often as he plea&s;ed. The laity grumbled, quarrelled with their wives and daughters, hated their confe&s;&s;ors, and maintained them in opulence and ea&s;e. The&s;e, the&s;e were happy times, Mr. Rigmarole; the&s;e were times of piety, bravery, and &s;impli|city! <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Not &s;o very happy, neither, good ma|dam; pretty much like the pre&s;ent; tho&s;e that labour &s;tarve; and tho&s;e that do nothing, wear fine cloaths and live in luxury."</Q></P>
<P>IN this manner the fathers lived, for &s;ome years, without mole&s;tation; they tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="166" REF="175">
confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to each other, and were forgiven. One evening, however, our prior keeping a lady of di&s;tinction &s;omewhat too long at confe&s;&s;ion, her hu&s;band unexpectedly came upon them, and te&s;tified all the indignation which was natural upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion. The prior a&s;&s;ured the gentleman that it was the de|vil who had put it into his heart; and the lady was very certain, that &s;he was under the influ|ence of magic, or &s;he could never have behaved in &s;o unfaithful a manner. The hu&s;band, how|ever, was not to be put off by &s;uch eva&s;ions, but &s;ummoned both before the tribunal of ju&s;|tice. His proofs were flagrant, and he expected large damages. Such, indeed, he had a right to expect, were the tribunals of tho&s;e days con|&s;tituted in the &s;ame manner as they are now. The cau&s;e of the prie&s;t was to be tried before an a&s;&s;embly of prie&s;ts; and a layman was to expect redre&s;s only from their impartiality and candour. What plea then do you think the prior made to obviate this accu&s;ation? He de|nied the fact, and challenged the plaintiff to try the merits of their cau&s;e by &s;ingle combat. It was a little hard, you may be &s;ure, upon the poor gentleman, not only to be made a cuckold, but to be obliged to fight a duel into the bar|gain; yet &s;uch was the ju&s;tice of the times.
<PB N="167" REF="176">
The prior threw down his glove, and the in|jured hu&s;band was obliged to take it up, in token of his accepting the challenge. Upon this, the prie&s;t &s;upplied his champion, for it was not lawful for the clergy to fight; and the defendant and plaintiff, according to cu&s;tom, were put in pri&s;on; both ordered to fa&s;t and pray, every method being previou&s;ly u&s;ed to in|duce both to a confe&s;&s;ion of the truth. After a month's impri&s;onment, the hair of each was cut, the bodies anointed with oil, the field of battle appointed and guarded by &s;oldiers, while his maje&s;ty pre&s;ided over the whole in per&s;on. Both the champions were &s;worn not to &s;eek victory either by fraud or magic. They prayed and confe&s;&s;ed upon their knees; and after the&s;e ceremonies, the re&s;t was left to the courage and conduct of the combatants. As the champion whom the prior had pitched upon, had fought &s;ix or eight times upon &s;imilar occa&s;ions, it was no way extraordinary to find him victorious in the pre&s;ent combat. In &s;hort, the hu&s;band was di&s;comfitted; he was taken from the field of battle, &s;tripped to his &s;hirt, and, after one of his legs were cut off, as ju&s;tice ordained in &s;uch ca&s;es, he was hanged as a terror to future of|fenders. The&s;e, tho&s;e were the times, Mr. Rigmarole; you &s;ee how much more ju&s;t,
<PB N="168" REF="177">
and wi&s;e, and valiant, our ance&s;tors were than us. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I rather fancy, madam, that the times then were pretty much like our own; where a multiplicity of laws give a judge as much power as a want of law; &s;ince he is ever &s;ure to find among the number &s;ome to countenance his partiality."</Q></P>
<P>OUR convent, victorious over their enemies, now gave a loo&s;e to every demon&s;tration of joy. The lady became a nun, the prior was made a bi&s;hop, and three Wickliffites were burned in the illuminations and fire-works that were made on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. Our convent now began to enjoy a very high degree of repu|tation. There was not one in London that had the character of hating heretics &s;o much as ours. Ladies of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction cho&s;e from our convent their confe&s;&s;ors; in &s;hort, it flou|ri&s;hed, and might have flouri&s;hed to this hour, but for a fatal accident which terminated in its overthrow. The lady whom the prior had placed in a nunnery, and whom he continued to vi&s;it for &s;ome time with great punctuality, began at la&s;t to perceive that &s;he was quite for|&s;aken. Secluded from conver&s;ation, as u&s;ual, &s;he now entertained the vi&s;ions of a devotee; found her&s;elf &s;trangely di&s;turbed; but he&s;itated
<PB N="169" REF="178">
in determining, whether &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an angel or a daemon. She was not long in &s;u&s;|pence; for, upon vomiting a large quantity of crooked pins, and finding the palms of her hands turned outwards, &s;he quickly concluded that &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the devil. She &s;oon lo&s;t entirely the u&s;e of &s;peech; and, when &s;he &s;eemed to &s;peak, every body that was pre&s;ent perceived that her voice was not her own, but that of the devil within her. In &s;hort, &s;he was bewitched; and all the difficulty lay in deter|mining who it could be that bewitched her. The nuns and the monks all demanded the magici|an's name, but the devil made no reply; for he knew they had no authority to a&s;k que&s;tions. By the rules of witchcraft, when an evil &s;pirit has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he may refu&s;e to an&s;wer any que&s;tions a&s;ked him, unle&s;s they are put by a bi&s;hop, and to the&s;e he is obliged to reply. A bi&s;hop, therefore, was &s;ent for, and now the whole &s;ecret came out: the devil reluctantly owned that he was a &s;ervant of the prior; that, by his command, he re&s;ided in his pre&s;ent ha|bitation; and that, without his command, he was re&s;olved to keep in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The bi&s;hop was an able exorci&s;t; he drove the devil out by force of my&s;tical arms; the prior was arraigned for witchcraft; the witne&s;&s;es were &s;trong and
<PB N="170" REF="179">
numerous again&s;t him, not le&s;s than fourteen per&s;ons being by who heard the devil talk Latin. There was no re&s;i&s;ting &s;uch a cloud of witne&s;&s;es; the prior was condemned; and he who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at &s;o many burnings, was burned him&s;elf in turn. The&s;e were times, Mr. Rigmarole; the people of tho&s;e times were not infidels, as now, but &s;incere believers! <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Equally faulty with our&s;elves; they be|lieved what the devil was plea&s;ed to tell them; and we &s;eem re&s;olved, at la&s;t, to be|lieve neither God nor devil."</Q></P>
<P>AFTER &s;uch a &s;tain upon the convent, it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed it could &s;ub&s;i&s;t any longer; the fathers were ordered to decamp, and the hou&s;e was once again converted into a tavern. The king conferred it on one of his ea&s;t mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; &s;he was con&s;tituted landlady by royal authority; and, as the tavern was in the neighbourhood of the court, and the mi&s;tre&s;s a very polite woman, it began to have more bu&s;ine&s;s than ever; and &s;ometimes took not le&s;s than four &s;hillings a day.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps you are de&s;irous of knowing what were the peculiar qualifications of women of fa&s;hion at that period; and in a de&s;cription
<PB N="171" REF="180">
of the pre&s;ent landlady, you will have a tolera|ble idea of all the re&s;t. This lady was the daughter of a nobleman, and received &s;uch an education in the country as became her quality, beauty, and great expectations. She could make &s;hifts and ho&s;e for her&s;elf and all the &s;er|vants of the family, when &s;he was twelve years old. She knew the names of the four and twenty letters, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible to be|witch her; and this was a greater piece of learning than any lady in the whole country could pretend to. She was always up early, and &s;aw breakfa&s;t &s;erved in the great hall by &s;ix o'clock. At this &s;cene of fe&s;tivity &s;he generally improved good-humour, by telling her dreams, relating &s;tories of &s;pirits, &s;everal of which &s;he her&s;elf had &s;een; and one of which &s;he was re|ported to have killed with a black-ha&s;ted knife. From hence &s;he u&s;ually went to make pa&s;try in the larder, and here &s;he was followed by her &s;weet-hearts, who were much helped on in con|ver&s;ation by &s;truggling with her for ki&s;&s;es. About ten, mi&s;s generally went to play at hot-cockles and blindman's buff in the parlour; and when the young folks (for they &s;eldom played at hot-cockles when grown old) were tired of &s;uch amu&s;ements, the gentlemen en|tertained mi&s;s with the hi&s;tory of their grey|hounds,
<PB N="172" REF="181">
bear-baitings, and victories at cudgel-playing. If the weather was fine, they ran at the ring, &s;hot at butts, while mi&s;s held in her hand a ribbon, with which &s;he adorned the conqueror. Her mental qualifications were ex|actly fitted to her external accompli&s;hments. Before &s;he was fifteen, &s;he could tell the &s;tory of Jack the Giant Killer, could name every mountain that was inhabited by fairies, knew a witch at fir&s;t &s;ight, and could repeat four Latin prayers without a prompter. Her dre&s;s was per|fectly fa&s;hionable; her arms and her hair were completely covered; a mon&s;trous ruff was put round her neck; &s;o that her head &s;eemed like that of John the Bapti&s;t placed in a charger. In &s;hort, when completely equipped, her ap|pearance was &s;o very mode&s;t, that &s;he di&s;co|vered little more than her no&s;e. The&s;e were the times, Mr. Rigmarole; when every lady that had a good no&s;e might &s;et up for a beauty; when every woman that could tell &s;tories, might be cried up for a wit. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am as much di&s;|plea&s;ed at tho&s;e dre&s;&s;es which conceal too much, as at tho&s;e which di&s;cover too much: I am equally an enemy to a female dunce or a female pedant."</Q></P>
<P>YOU may be &s;ure that mi&s;s cho&s;e a hu&s;|band with qualifications re&s;embling her own;
<PB N="173" REF="182">
&s;he pitched upon a courtier, equally remark|able for hunting and drinking, who had given &s;everal proofs of his great virility among the daughters of his tenants and dome&s;tics. They fell in love at fir&s;t &s;ight (for &s;uch was the gal|lantry of the times) were married, came to court, and madam appeared with &s;uperior qua|lifications. The king was &s;truck with her beauty. All property was at the king's com|mand; the hu&s;band was obliged to re&s;ign all preten&s;ions in his wi&s;e to the &s;overeign whom God had anointed, to commit adultery where he thought proper. The king loved her for &s;ome time; but, at length repenting of his mi&s;deeds, and in&s;tigated by his father-confe&s;|&s;or, from a principle of con&s;cience removed her from his levee to the bar of this tavern, and took a new mi&s;tre&s;s in her &s;tead. Let it not &s;urprize you to behold the mi&s;tre&s;s of a king de|graded to &s;o humble an office. As the ladies had no mental accompli&s;hments, a good face was enough to rai&s;e them to the royal couch; and &s;he who was this day a royal mi&s;tre&s;s, might the next, when her beauty palled upon enjoy|ment, be doomed to infamy and want.</P>
<P>UNDER the care of this lady, the tavern grew into great reputation; the courtiers had
<PB N="174" REF="183">
not yet learned to game, but they paid it off by drinking; drunkenne&s;s is ever the vice of a bar|barous, and gaming of a luxurious age. They had not &s;uch frequent entertainments as the moderns have, but were more expen&s;ive and more luxurious in tho&s;e they had. All their fooleries were more elaborate, and more ad|mired by the great and the vulgar than now. A courtier has been known to &s;pend his whole fortune at a &s;ingle fea&s;t, a king to mortgage his dominions to furni&s;h out the fripery of a tourna|ment. There were certain days appointed for riot and debauchery, and to be &s;ober at &s;uch times was reputed a crime. Kings them&s;elves &s;et the example; and I have &s;een monarchs in this room drunk before the entertainment was half concluded. The&s;e were the times, Sir, when kings kept mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and got drunk in public; they were too plain and &s;imple in tho&s;e happy times to hide their vices, and act the hy|pocrite, as now. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lord!

The gal|lants of tho&s;e times pretty much re&s;embled the bloods of ours; they were fond of plea&s;ure, but quite ignorant of the art of refining upon it: thus a court bawd of tho&s;e times re&s;embled the common low-lived harridan of a modern bag|nio. Witne&s;s, ye powers of debauchery, how often I have been pre&s;ent at the various appear|ances of drunkenne&s;s, riot, guilt, and bruta|lity! A tavern is a true picture of human in|firmity; in hi&s;tory we find only one &s;ide of the age exhibited to our view; but in the account of a tavern we &s;ee every age equally ab&s;urd and equally vicious.</P>
<P>UPON this lady's decea&s;e the tavern was &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively occupied by adventurers, bullies, pimps and game&s;ters. Towards the conclu&s;ion of the reign of Henry VII. gaming was more univer|&s;ally practi&s;ed in England than even now.

Kings them&s;elves have been known to play off, at Primero, not only all the money and jewels they could part with, but the very images in churches. The la&s;t Henry played away, in this very room, not only the four great bells of St. Paul's cathedral, but the fine image of St. Paul, which &s;tood upon the top of the &s;pire, to Sir Miles Partridge, who took them down the next day, and &s;old them by auction. Have you then any cau&s;e to regret being born in the times you now live? or do you &s;till believe that human nature continues to run on declining every age? If we ob&s;erve the actions of the bufy part of mankind, your ance&s;tors will be found infinitely more gro&s;s, &s;ervile, and even di&s;hone&s;t, than you. If, for&s;aking hi&s;tory, we only trace them in their hours of amu&s;ement and di&s;&s;ipation, we &s;hall find them more &s;en&s;ual, more entirely devoted to plea&s;ure, and infinitely more &s;elfi&s;h.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t ho&s;te&s;s of note I find upon record was Jane Rou&s;e. She was born among the lower ranks of the people; and, by frugality and extreme complai&s;ance, contrived to acquire a moderate fortune: this &s;he might have enjoyed for many years, had &s;he not unfortunately quar|relled with one of her neighbours, a woman who
<PB N="177" REF="186">
was in high repute for &s;anctity through the whole pari&s;h. In the times of which I &s;peak, two women &s;eldom quarrelled, that one did not accu&s;e the other of witchcraft, and &s;he who fir&s;t contrived to vomit crooked pins was &s;ure to come off victorious. The &s;candal of a modern tea-table differs widely from the &s;candal of for|mer times: the fa&s;cination of a lady's eyes, at pre&s;ent, is regarded as a compliment; but if a lady, formerly, &s;hould be accu&s;ed of having witchcraft in her eyes, it were much better, both for her &s;oul and body, that &s;he had no eyes at all.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, Jane Rou&s;e was accu&s;ed of witch|craft; and, though &s;he made the be&s;t defence &s;he could, it was all to no purpo&s;e; &s;he was taken from her own bar to the bar of the Old-Bailey, condemned, and executed accordingly. The&s;e were times, indeed! when even women could not &s;cold in &s;afety.</P>
<P>SINCE her time the tavern underwent &s;e|veral revolutions, according to the &s;pirit of the times, or the di&s;po&s;ition of the reigning mo|narch. It was this day a brothel, and the next a conventicle for enthu&s;ia&s;ts. It was one year noted for harbouring whigs, and the next infa|mous

for a retreat to tories. Some years ago it was in high vogue, but at pre&s;ent it &s;eems de|clining. This only may be remarked in general, that, whenever taverns flouri&s;h mo&s;t, the times are then mo&s;t extravagant and luxurious.&mdash; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lord!

<P>WHATEVER may be the merits of the Engli&s;h in other &s;ciences, they &s;eem peculiarly excellent in the art of healing. There is &s;carcely a di&s;order incident to huma|nity, again&s;t which our adverti&s;ing doctors are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a mo&s;t infallible antidote. The profe&s;&s;ors of other arts confe&s;s the inevita|ble intricacy of things; talk with doubt, and decide with he&s;itation; but doubting is entirely unknown in medicine; the adverti&s;ing profe&s;|&s;ors here delight in ca&s;es of difficulty: be the di&s;order never &s;o de&s;perate or radical, you will find numbers in every &s;treet, who, by leveling a pill at the part affected, promi&s;e a certain cure without lo&s;s of time, knowledge of a bedfellow, or hindrance of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider the a&s;&s;iduity of this pro|fe&s;&s;ion, their benevolence amazes me. They not only, in general, give their medicines for half value, but u&s;e the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive remon|&s;trances to induce the &s;ick to come and be cured. Sure there mu&s;t be &s;omething &s;trangely ob&s;ti|nate

in an Engli&s;h patient, who refu&s;es &s;o much health upon &s;uch ea&s;y terms! Does he take a pride in being bloated with a drop&s;y? Does he find plea&s;ure in the alternations of an intermittent fever? Or feel as much &s;atisfac|tion in nur&s;ing up his gout&punc; as he found plea|&s;ure in acquiring it? He mu&s;t, otherwi&s;e he would never reject &s;uch repeated a&s;&s;urances of in&s;tant relief. What can be more convincing than the manner in which the &s;ick are invited to be well? The doctor fir&s;t begs the mo&s;t earne&s;t attention of the public to what he is go|ing to propo&s;e; he &s;olemnly affirms the pill was never &s;ound to want &s;ucce&s;s; he produces a li&s;t of tho&s;e who have been re&s;cued from the grave by taking it. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, there are many here who now and then think proper to be &s;ick: only &s;ick did I &s;ay? There are &s;ome who even think proper to die! Yes, by the head of Confucius, they die; though they might have purcha&s;ed the health-re&s;toring &s;pecific for half a crown at every cor|ner.</P>
<P>I CAN never enough admire the &s;agacity of this country for the encouragement given to the profe&s;&s;ors of this art; with what indulgence does &s;he fo&s;ter up tho&s;e of her own growth, and
<PB N="181" REF="190">
kindly cheri&s;h tho&s;e that come from abroad! Like a &s;kilful gardener &s;he invites them from every foreign climate to her&s;elf. Here every great exotic &s;trikes root as &s;oon as imported, and feels the genial beam of favour; while the mighty metropolis, like one va&s;t munificent dunghill, receives them indi&s;criminately to her brea&s;t, and &s;upplies each with more than native nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>IN other countries, the phy&s;ician pretends to cure di&s;orders in the lump; the &s;ame doctor who combats the gout in the toe, &s;hall pretend to pre&s;cribe for a pain in the head; and he who at one time cures a con&s;umption, &s;hall at ano|ther give drugs for a drop&s;y. How ab&s;urd and ridiculous! This is being a mere jack of all trades. Is the animal machine le&s;s complicated than a bra&s;s pin? Not le&s;s than ten different hands are required to make a bra&s;s pin; and &s;hall the body be &s;et right by one &s;ingle opera|tor?</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h are &s;en&s;ible of the force of this rea&s;oning; they have therefore one doctor for the eyes, another for the toes; they have their &s;ciatica doctors, and inoculating doctors; they have one doctor who is mode&s;tly content with
<PB N="182" REF="191">
&s;ecuring them from bugbites, and five hundred who pre&s;cribe for the bite of mad dogs.</P>
<P>BUT as nothing plea&s;es curio&s;ity more than anecdotes of the great, however minute or trifling, I mu&s;t pre&s;ent you, inadequate as my abilities are to the &s;ubject, with an account of one or two of tho&s;e per&s;onages who lead in this honourable profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t upon the li&s;t of glory is doctor Richard Rock, F. U. N. This great man is &s;hort of &s;tature, is fat, and waddles as he walks. He always wears a white three-tailed wig nicely combed, and frizzled upon each cheek. Sometimes he carries a cane, but a hat never; it is indeed very remarkable that this extraordinary per&s;onage &s;hould never wear a hat, but &s;o it is an hat he never wears. He is u&s;ually drawn, at the top of his own bills, &s;itting in his arm-chair, holding a little bottle between his finger and thumb, and &s;urrounded with rotten teeth, nippers, pills, pacquets, and gally-pots. No man can promi&s;e fairer or bet|ter than he; for, as he ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Be your di&s;order never &s;o far gone, be under no un|ea&s;ine&s;s, make your&s;elf quite ea&s;y, I can cure you."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="192">THE next in fame, though by &s;ome reck|oned of equal preten&s;ions, is doctor Timothy Franks, F. O. G. H. living in the Old Bailey. As Rock is remarkably &s;quab, his great rival Franks is as remarkably tall. He was born in the year of the Chri&s;tian aera 1692, and is, while I now write, exactly &s;ixty-eight years, three months, and four days old. Age, how|ever, has no ways impaired his u&s;ual health and vivacity; I am told he generally walks with his brea&s;t open. This gentleman, who is of a mixed reputation, is particularly remarkable for a becoming a&s;&s;urance, which carries him gently through life; for, except doctor Rock, none are more ble&s;&s;ed with the advantages of face than doctor Franks.</P>
<P>And yet the great have their foibles as well as the little. I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to mention it. &mdash;Let the foibles of the great re&s;t in peace.&mdash; Yet I mu&s;t impart the whole.&mdash;The&s;e two great men are actually now at variance; like mere men, mere common mortals. Rock advi&s;es the world to beware of bog-trotting quacks; Franks retorts the wit and the &s;arca&s;m, by fix|ing on his rival the odious appellation of Dump|ling Dick. He calls the &s;erious doctor Rock, Dumpling Dick! Head of Confucius, what
<PB N="184" REF="193">
profanation! Dumplin Dick! What a pity, ye powers, that the learned, who were born mutually to a&s;&s;i&s;t in enlightening the world, &s;hould thus differ among them&s;elves, and make even the profe&s;&s;ion ridiculous! Sure the world is wide enough, at lea&s;t, for two great per&s;on|ages to figure in; men of &s;cience &s;hould leave controver&s;y to the little world below them; and then we might &s;ee Rock and Franks walk|ing together, hand in hand, &s;miling onward to immortality.</P>

<P>I AM fond of amu&s;ement in whatever com|pany it is to be found; and wit, though dre&s;&s;ed in rags, is ever plea&s;ing to me. I went &s;ome days ago to take a walk in St. James's Park, about the hour in which company leave it to go to dinner. There were but few in the walks, and tho&s;e who &s;tayed, &s;eemed by their looks rather more willing to forget that they had an appetite than gain one. I &s;at down on one of the benches, at the other end of which was &s;eated a man in very &s;habby cloaths.</P>

If I have three pence in my pocket, I never re|fu&s;e to be my three halfpence; and, if I have no money, I never &s;corn to be treated by any that are kind enough to pay my reckoning. What think you, &s;ir, of a &s;teak and a tankard?

<P>AS I never refu&s;e a &s;mall expence for the &s;ake of a merry companion, we in&s;tantly ad|journed to a neighbouring alehou&s;e, and, in a

<P>THE formalities, delays and di&s;appoint|ments, that precede a treaty of marriage here, are u&s;ually as numerous as tho&s;e previous to a treaty of peace.

<P>YET, from the vernal &s;oftne&s;s of the air, the verdure of the fields, the tran&s;parency of the &s;treams, and the beauty of the women, I know few countries more proper to invite to court&s;hip. Here love might &s;port among painted lawns and warbling groves, and revel amid&s;t gales, wafting at once both fragrance and harmony. Yet it &s;eems he has for&s;aken the i&s;land; and, when a couple are now to be mar|ried, mutual love, or an union of minds, is the la&s;t and mo&s;t trifling con&s;ideration.

I am told there was a time, when ladies, with no other merit but youth, virtue and beauty, had a chance for hu&s;bands, at lea&s;t, among the mi|ni&s;ters of the church or the officers of the army. The blu&s;h and innocence of &s;ixteen was &s;aid to have a powerful influence over the&s;e two pro|fe&s;&s;ions. But of late, all the little traffic of blu&s;hing, ogling, dimpling, and &s;miling, has been forbidden by an act in that ca&s;e wi&s;ely made and provided. A lady's whole cargo of &s;miles, &s;ighs and whi&s;pers, is declared utterly contraband, till &s;he arrives in the warm lati|tudes of twenty-two, where commodities of this nature are too often found to decay. She is then permitted to dimple and &s;mile, when the dimples and &s;miles begin to for&s;ake her; and, when perhaps grown ugly, is charitably en|tru&s;ted with an unlimited u&s;e of her charms.
<PB N="208" REF="217">

I knew him to be hone&s;t and indu&s;trious when in the country, and was curious to learn what had reduced him to his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Where|fore, after giving him what I thought proper, I de&s;ired to know the hi&s;tory of his life and misfortunes, and the manner in which he was reduced to his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. The di&s;abled &s;oldier, for &s;uch he was, though dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ailor's habit, &s;cratching his head, and leaning on his crutch, put him&s;elf into an attitude to comply with my reque&s;t, and gave me his hi|&s;tory as follows:</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I WAS born in Shrop&s;hire, my father was a labourer, and died when I was five years old; &s;o I was put upon the pari&s;h. As he had been a wandering &s;ort of a man, the pari&s;hioners were not able to tell to what pari&s;h I belonged, or where I was born, &s;o they &s;ent me to another pari&s;h, and that pari&s;h &s;ent me to a third. I thought in my heart, they kept &s;ending me about &s;o long, that they would not let me be born in any pari&s;h at all; but, at la&s;t, however, they fixed me. I had &s;ome di&s;po|&s;ition to be a &s;cholar, and was re&s;olved, at lea&s;t, to know my letters; but the ma&s;ter of the work-hou&s;e put me to bu&s;ine&s;s as &s;oon as I was able to handle a mallet; and here I lived an ea&s;y kind of a life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my la|bour. It is true, I was not &s;uffered to &s;tir out of the hou&s;e, for fear, as they &s;aid, I &s;hould run away: but what of that, I had the liberty of the whole hou&s;e, and the yard before the door, and that was enough for
<PB N="218" REF="227">
me. I was then bound out to a farmer, where I was up both early and late; but I ate and drank well, and liked my bu&s;ine&s;s well enough, till he died, when I was obliged to provide for my&s;elf; &s;o I was re&s;olved to go and &s;eek my fortune.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"IN this manner I went from town to town, worked when I could get employment, and &s;tarved when I could get none: when hap|pening one day to go through a field belong|ing to a ju&s;tice of peace, I &s;py'd a hare cro&s;&s;ing the path ju&s;t before me; and I be|lieve the devil put it in my head to fling my &s;tick at it:&mdash;Well, what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away in triumph, when the ju&s;tice him&s;elf met me: he called me a poacher and a villain; and collaring me, de&s;ired I would give an account of my&s;elf: I fell upon my knees, begged his wor&s;hip's pardon, and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, &s;eed, and generation; but, though I gave a very good account, the ju&s;tice would not believe a &s;yllable I had to &s;ay; &s;o I was indicted at &s;e&s;&s;ions, found guilty of being poor, and &s;ent up to London to New|gate, in order to be tran&s;ported as a vaga|bond.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="228"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"PEOPLE may &s;ay this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in all my life. I had my belly full to eat and drink, and did no work at all. This kind of life was too good to la&s;t for ever; &s;o I was taken out of pri&s;on, after five months, put on board a &s;hip, and &s;ent off, with two hundred more, to the plantations. We had but an indifferent pa&s;&s;age, for, being all confined in the hold, more than a hundred of our people died for want of &s;weet air; and tho&s;e that remained were &s;ickly enough, God knows. When we came a-&s;hore we were &s;old to the planters, and I was bound for &s;even years more. As I was no &s;cholar, for I did not know my letters, I was obliged to work among the negroes; and I &s;erved out my time, as in duty bound to do.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"WHEN my time was expired, I worked my pa&s;&s;age home, and glad I was to &s;ee Old England again, becau&s;e I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I &s;hould be in|dicted for a vagabond once more, &s;o did not much care to go down into the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobbs when I could get them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="229"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I WAS very happy in this manner for &s;ome time, till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then de&s;ired me to &s;tand.

I cho&s;e the latter; and, in this po&s;t of a gentleman, I &s;erved two campaigns in Flanders, was at the battles of Val and Fontenoy, and re|ceived but one wound, through the brea&s;t here; but the doctor of our regiment &s;oon made me well again.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"WHEN the peace came on I was di&s;|charged; and, as I could not work, becau&s;e my wound was &s;ometimes trouble&s;ome, I li&s;ted for a landman in the Ea&s;t-India com|pany's &s;ervice. I here fought the French in &s;ix pitched battles; and I verily believe, that, if I could read or write, our captain would have made me a corporal. But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion, for I &s;oon fell &s;ick, and &s;o got leave to re|turn home again with forty pounds in my pocket. This was at the beginning of the

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"OUR crew was carried into Bre&s;t, and many of them died, becau&s;e they were not u&s;ed to live in a jail; but, for my part, it was nothing to me, for I was &s;ea&s;oned. One night, as I was &s;leeping on the bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me, for I always loved to lie well, I was awakened by the boat&s;wain, who had a dark lanthorn in his hand; 'Jack,' &s;ays he to me, 'will you knock out the French centry's brains?'

So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the cloaths I had, about my middle, and went with him to fight the Frenchmen.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"THOUGH we had no arms, one Eng|li&s;hman is able to beat five French at any time; &s;o we went down to the door, where both the centries were po&s;ted, and ru&s;hing upon them, &s;eized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence, nine of us ran together to the quay, and, &s;eizing the fir&s;t boat we met, got out of the harbour and put to &s;ea. We had not been here three days before we were taken up by the Dor&s;et privateer, who were glad of &s;o many good hands; and we con|&s;ented to run our chance. However, we had not as much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with the Pompadour privateer, of forty guns, while we had but twenty-three; &s;o to it we went, yard-arm and yard-arm.

<HEAD>ESSAY XXV. Suppo&s;ed to be written by the Ordinary of Newgate.</HEAD>
<P>MAN is a mo&s;t frail being, incapable of directing his &s;teps, unacquainted with what is to happen in this life; and perhaps no man is a more manife&s;t in&s;tance of the truth of this maxim, than Mr. The. Cibber, ju&s;t now gone out of the world. Such a variety of turns of fortune, yet &s;uch a per&s;evering uniformity of conduct, appears in all that hap|pened in his &s;hort &s;pan, that the whole may be looked upon as one regular confu&s;ion: every action of his life was matter of wonder and &s;ur|prize, and his death was an a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>THIS gentleman was born of creditable pa|rents, who gave him a very good education, and a great deal of good learning, &s;o that he could read and write before he was &s;ixteen. How|ever, he early di&s;covered an inclination to fol|low
<PB N="225" REF="234">
lewd cour&s;es; he refu&s;ed to take the advice of his parents, and pur&s;ued the bent of his in|clination; he played at cards on Sundays, called him&s;elf a gentleman; fell out with his mother and laundre&s;s; and, even in the&s;e early days, his father was frequently heard to ob&s;erve, that young The.&mdash;would be hanged.</P>
<P>AS he advanced in years, he grew more fond of plea&s;ure; would eat an ortolan for dinner, though he begged the guinea that bought it; and was once known to give three pounds for a plate of green pea&s;e, which he had collected over-night as charity for a friend in di&s;tre&s;s: he ran into debt with every body that would tru&s;t him, and none could build a &s;conce bet|ter than he: &s;o that, at la&s;t, his creditors &s;wore with one accord that The.&mdash;would be hanged.</P>
<P>BUT, as getting into debt by a man who had no vi&s;ible means but impudence for &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, is a thing that every reader is not ac|quainted with, I mu&s;t explain that point a lit|tle, and that to his &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>THERE are three ways of getting into debt; fir&s;t, by pu&s;hing a face; as thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You, Mr.
<PB N="226" REF="235">
Lute&s;tring, &s;end me home &s;ix yards of that padua&s;oy, dammee; &mdash; but, harkee, don't think I ever intend to pay you for it, dam|mee."</Q> At this, the mercer laughs heartily; cuts off the padua&s;oy, and &s;ends it home; nor is he, till too late, &s;urpri&s;ed to find the gentle|man had &s;aid nothing but truth, and kept his word.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd method of running into debt is called &s;ineering; which is getting goods made up in &s;uch a fa&s;hion as to be unfit for every other purcha&s;er; and, if the trade&s;man refu&s;es to give them upon credit, then threaten to leave them upon his hands.</P>
<P>BUT the third and be&s;t method is called, "Being the good cu&s;tomer." The gentleman fir&s;t buys &s;ome trifle, and pays for it in ready-money; he comes a few days after with no|thing about him but bank bills, and buys, we will &s;uppo&s;e, a &s;ix-penny tweezer-ca&s;e; the bills are too great to be changed, &s;o he pro|mi&s;es to return punctually the day after and pay for what he has bought. In this promi&s;e he is punctual, and this is repeated for eight or ten times, till his face is well known, and he
<PB N="227" REF="236">
has got, at la&s;t, the character of a good cu&s;|tomer. By this means he gets credit for &s;ome|thing con&s;iderable, and then never pays for it.</P>
<P>IN all this, the young man who is the un|happy &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent reflections, was very expert; and could face, fineer, and bring cu&s;tom to a &s;hop with any man in England: none of his companions could exceed him in this; and his very companions at la&s;t &s;aid that The.&mdash;would be hanged.</P>
<P>AS he grew old, he grew never the better; he loved ortolans and green pea&s;e, as before; he drank gravy-&s;oup when he could get it, and always thought his oy&s;ters ta&s;ted be&s;t when he got them for nothing, or, which was ju&s;t the &s;ame, when he bought them upon tick: thus the old man kept up the vices of the youth, and what he wanted in power, he made up by in|clination; &s;o that all the world thought that old The.&mdash;would be hanged.</P>
<P>AND now, reader, I have brought him to his la&s;t &s;cene; a &s;cene were, perhaps, my duty &s;hould have obliged me to a&s;&s;i&s;t. You expect, perhaps, his dying words, and the tender fare|well
<PB N="228" REF="237">
he took of his wife and children; you ex|pect an account of his coffin and white gloves, his pious ejaculations, and the papers he left behind him. In this I cannot indulge your cu|rio&s;ity; for, oh! the my&s;teries of fate, The. &mdash; was drown'd!</P>
