<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving been employed on a Voyage into the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> under the Command of Capt. <HI>Dampier,</HI> in the Year 1703, and having
<PB REF="3">
both in that Expedition, and in my Return by the Ea&s;tern|part of the South-Sea, and through the <HI>Indian</HI>-Ocean, re|marked not only faithfully, but with all the Accuracy I could, whatever I conceived might be &s;erviceable, or in&s;tructive to &s;uch as &s;hould hereafter &s;ail into tho&s;e Parts, I hope you will pardon my Pre&s;uption in laying my &s;aid Ob&s;ervations before you.</P>
<P>I humbly take the Liberty to repre&s;ent to you, that I have launched forth into no De&s;crip|tions, or particular Accounts of Things, which the Cour&s;e of my Voyage gave me not &s;ufficient Opportunity to be
<PB REF="4">
fully and perfectedly in&s;tructed in, and I &s;pared no Pains in the &s;etting them down, toge|ther with Draughts of &s;uch Places as I had time or conve|nience of taking; and in all this I have not through any de|&s;ign of contradicting others, or in hopes thereby to recommend my own Performance, either oppo&s;ed or &s;lighted any good and true Ob&s;ervations which have already been made by tho&s;e who have heretofore vi&s;ited any of the &s;ame Places. This I pre&s;ume to mention, with a particular regard to the mo&s;t material of Captain <HI>Dampier</HI>'s own Ob&s;ervations, formerly publi&s;hed, which I found by
<PB REF="5">
Experience to be true: But I hope I may, without breach of Mode&s;ty, declare that I have remarked &s;everal things both new and u&s;eful, which the un|common Cour&s;e we &s;teared, and the unu&s;ual Accidents we met with, gave me particular Opportunities to enquire into.</P>
<P>Sir, I am not pretending to a meritorious Claim of your Protection, but am encourag'd to hope for it from your known Candour and Goodne&s;s: And it is very natural to flatter our &s;elves, that Per&s;ons of your Judgment and Experience in Maritime Affairs, will look with a more favourable Eye,
<PB REF="6">
even on our meane&s;t Endea|vours, than tho&s;e can be ex|pected to do, who know but little of tho&s;e Matters, and are apt to prefer &s;uperficial Ac|counts, which are frequently very erroneous, before the mo&s;t u&s;eful, though le&s;s diverting. However it be, if I can be &s;o happy as to receive any coun|tenance from your di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Judgment, or at lea&s;t your Pardon for this my Boldne&s;s, I &s;hall not fear that any Opini|on or Prejudice of le&s;s di&s;cern|ing Per&s;ons, can di&s;credit the Truth, or U&s;efulne&s;s of my Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, Sir, how lit|tle I ought to encroach upon
<PB REF="7">
your Time, which is &s;o u&s;efully and &s;o diligently employed: And therefore I humbly beg leave to conclude with &s;ub&s;cri|bing my &s;elf,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your HONOURS mo&s;t Dutiful, mo&s;t Obedient, and mo&s;t Humble Servant, <HI>William Funnell.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>THE Voyages and De&s;crip|tions formerly publi&s;hed by Captain <HI>William Dampier,</HI> have met with &s;o good Reception and univer&s;al Approbation in the World; and there has been &s;o general an Ex|pectation of the Succe&s;s of the pre&s;ent Expedition, under the Command of a Per&s;on &s;o perfectly acquainted with tho&s;e Parts of the World to which we were
<PB REF="9">
bound, and &s;o well skilled in the Trade, Shipping, Cu&s;toms and De&s;igns of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> again&s;t whom we were employed; that I pre&s;ume there needs no Apology, for publi&s;hing the following Ac|count.</P>
<P>The Succe&s;s indeed of our Ex|pedition, was not &s;uch as might at fir&s;t have been expected from the Skill of our Commander and the Re&s;olution of our Men. Di&s;a|greements and Mi&s;managements having broken our Mea&s;ures, and defeated our mo&s;t promi&s;ing Hopes; as they have often been Occa&s;ions of the mi&s;carriage of the greate&s;t and noble&s;t Attempts.</P>
<P><PB REF="10">
But though we failed in our chief De&s;igns; yet the great Va|riety of Accidents we met with, and the many Di&s;coveries we made, and particular Accounts of the manner how our Attempts mi&s;carried, I hope cannot but be very acceptable to the inqui&s;itive Reader.</P>
<P>I have cho&s;en not to be large in the De&s;criptions of Towns and Places, of which others have already given us &s;ufficient Accounts. But the whole We&s;tern Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> from the South|end of <HI>California</HI> to the Port of <HI>Valdivia,</HI> which is above &s;ixty Degrees, I have given one con|tinued and much more particular
<PB REF="11">
De&s;cription of, than has ever yet been made publick; and al&s;o I have given an exact Account of the Variation of the Compa&s;s upon the whole Coa&s;t. And though it may perhaps by &s;ome be thought not &s;o plea&s;ant and entertaining, as De&s;criptions of the Country within Land; yet it cannot but be much more u&s;eful, e&s;pecially to &s;uch as &s;hall hereafter &s;ail into tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>And here I cannot in ju&s;tice but take notice, that upon all this Coa&s;t, and during our whole &s;tay in the South Seas, we found Captain <HI>Dampier</HI>'s De&s;criptions of Places very exact; and his
<PB REF="12">
Account of Winds, Currents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> very extraordinary.</P>
<P>After our parting from Capt. <HI>Dampier</HI> in the Gulf of <HI>Ama|palla,</HI> and running over to <HI>In|dia;</HI> we met, as with many Hard&s;hips, &s;o al&s;o with &s;ome Variety of new Di&s;coveries, in our wandering among un|known Spice-I&s;lands: And par|ticularly the Mi&s;fortunes, which nece&s;&s;itated us to put in at <HI>Amboyna,</HI> where we were de|tained Pri&s;oners by the <HI>Dutch;</HI> gave me an opportunity of ma|king &s;uch Enquiries into the State, Government, Product, Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of that I&s;land,
<PB REF="13">
as I per&s;wade my &s;elf will be very acceptable to the ingenious Reader.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE were at fir&s;t Two Ships, of Twenty-&s;ix Guns and One hun|dred and twenty Men each; de&s;ign|ed
<PB N="2" REF="26">
for the South-Seas: The one was named the St <HI>George,</HI> Captain <HI>Willi|am Dampier</HI> Commander, on Board of which I was; and the other was na|med the <HI>Fame, John Pulling</HI> Captain. We were each of us &s;upplied with all War-like Stores, and very well victualled for nine Months; and had Commi&s;&s;ions from his Royal Highne&s;s the Lord High-Admiral, to proceed in a War-like man|ner again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards:</HI> And we Both were upon the &s;ame Terms, of no Purcha&s;e no Pay. But whil&s;t we were in the <HI>Downs,</HI> there ari&s;ing &s;ome Difference between the two Captains, Captain <HI>Pulling</HI> in his Ship the <HI>Fame</HI> went away and left us; intending, as he &s;aid, to go and cruize among the <HI>Canary-I&s;lands;</HI> and we never &s;aw him after. But before our going away from <HI>Ireland,</HI> we were joyned by another Ship &s;ent after us on purpo&s;e. She was a &s;mall Ship, named the <HI>Cinque-ports</HI> Gally, burthen about ninety Tuns, &s;ixteen Guns, and &s;ixty three Men, <HI>Charles Pickering</HI> Captain: Which Ship was al&s;o very well victualled and provided for the &s;aid Voyage. Our Propo&s;als were to go into the River of <HI>Plate,</HI> to <HI>Buonas Aires,</HI> to take two or three <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Galleons which Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> gives an account are u&s;ually there: And if by that Expediti|on we got to the value of 600000 Pounds,
<PB N="3" REF="27">
then to return again without proceeding further: But if we mi&s;&s;ed of Succe&s;s there, then to cruize upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru,</HI> for the <HI>Valdivia</HI> Ships, which commonly are &s;aid to bring down &s;tore of Gold to <HI>Lima:</HI> But if that De&s;ign &s;hould al&s;o fail, then to attempt &s;ome rich Towns, accord|ing as Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> &s;hould think fit: And after that, we were at the u&s;ual time of the Year to go down upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexico,</HI> to &s;eek for a great Galleon, which Trades from <HI>Manila,</HI> one of the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, to <HI>Acapulco</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexi|co;</HI> and which is commonly reported to be worth thirteen or fourteen Millions of Pieces of Eight. The Rea&s;on we did not go to <HI>Buonas Aires,</HI> was becau&s;e upon our arrival at <HI>Madera,</HI> we had advice that the Galleons before-mentioned were arrived at <HI>Teneriff.</HI> The Succe&s;s of our other De|&s;igns, are &s;et down particularly in the fol|lowing Relation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"> On the 30<HI>th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> 1703, we &s;ailed out of the <HI>Downs,</HI> and on the 18<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May</HI> anchored at <HI>King&s;ale</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI> Here we refitted and victualled our Ship; and were joined by another Ship named the <HI>Cinque-ports,</HI> burthen about ninety Tuns, &s;ixteen Guns, and &s;ixty three Men, <HI>Charles Pickering</HI> Captain: And on the 11th of
<PB N="4" REF="28">
<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"> <HI>September,</HI> we in company of our Con&s;ort Captain <HI>Pckering,</HI> left <HI>King&s;ale,</HI> and on the 25th we reached the I&s;land of <HI>Madera,</HI> where we did not anchor, but lay off and on for our Boats, which were &s;ent a&s;hore for &s;ome Nece&s;&s;aries. By a good ob&s;erva|tion I make this I&s;land to lye in the Lati|tude of 32 d. 20 m. <HI>N.</HI> And Longitude by my account from <HI>London, W.</HI> 18 d. 5 m.

<P>Having done our Bu&s;ine&s;s here, we de|parted <HI>Sept.</HI> 28, and on the 30th &s;aw <HI>Pal|ma</HI> and <HI>Fero,</HI> the two We&s;termo&s;t of the <HI>Canary</HI>-I&s;lands, they being in all &s;even, &s;o called from <HI>Canaria</HI> the Chief; They are al&s;o called <HI>Fortunate,</HI> from their Fruitful|ne&s;s, being plentiful in &s;everal &s;orts of Commodities, but e&s;pecially in the Wine called <HI>Canary,</HI> brought from hence in a|bundance.

<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"> get off any, becau&s;e here ran &s;o great a Surf that we dur&s;t not venture our Boats a&s;hore. So <HI>October</HI> the &s;eventh, in the Morning, we bore away for the I&s;land St <HI>Jago,</HI> and at Noon anchored at <HI>Prior Bay.</HI> This Bay lies in the Latitude of 14 d. 50 m. <HI>N.</HI> and We&s;t from <HI>London</HI> 24 d. 47 m.</P>
<P>This is one of the Southermo&s;t and mo&s;t fruitful of the <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> I&s;lands; it a|bounding in Hogs, Fowls, <HI>Guinea</HI>-Hens, Monkies, Maiz, Oranges, Lemons, Dates, Water-melons, Plantains, Bonanoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here is good Water to be had, but trouble|&s;ome fetching of it; and Wood is very dear, by rea&s;on of its &s;carcity. The Na|tives of this place were formerly <HI>Portu|gueze,</HI> who were bani&s;hed to this place for Murthers, Thefts, and other Villanies; but now they are mo&s;tly black, by rea&s;on of their Conver&s;e among&s;t their Women|&s;laves (which are <HI>Guinea Negroes;</HI>) And although they have changed their Colour, yet they &s;till retain their Vices; thieving being commoner here than in any place I have been in; in&s;omuch that they will take your Hat off your Head at Noon-day, although you be in the mid&s;t of Company. You mu&s;t al&s;o be very wary how you Trade with them; for if you let them have <HI>your</HI> Goods, before you have <HI>theirs,</HI> you will

<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"> be &s;ure to lo&s;e them. At this place we was ter'd our Ship and refre&s;h'd our &s;elves; and here being &s;ome Di&s;agreement between our Captain and fir&s;t Lieutenant, our Cap|tain turned him a&s;hore with his Che&s;t and and Cloaths and Servant, much again&s;t both their Wills, about twelve at Night. At four the next Morning, it being the 13th of <HI>October,</HI> we parted from the &s;aid I&s;land, not fully re&s;olved what place to touch at next. On <HI>October</HI> the 22d (being in the Latitude of 6 d. 36 m. <HI>N.</HI> and Longitude from <HI>London W.</HI> about 19 d. 57 m.) we caught four Fi&s;h; a Shark, a Dolphin, a Jelly-fi&s;h and an Old-wife.</P>
<P>The <HI>Shark</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See FIG.

It is &s;o fierce a Fi&s;h, that when it wants its Prey, it will &s;eize upon any thing, and make nothing of taking off a Man's Leg at a bite or two. He hath two Stones between his Eyes, which are accounted very good if taken inwardly by any one that has the Stone or Gravel. The&s;e Stones we com|monly take out and give to our Doctor, who makes u&s;e of them as he finds occa&s;i|on: When they are taken out of the Head,

For they can fly no longer than their Wings are wet, but then fall into the Water and mount again. It is very pretty to &s;ee what &s;hifts and turns they will make, to get clear of their great Ene|my the Dolphin; and rather than be taken by them, they will often fly into a &s;hip; but when they are in, unle&s;s they happen to fall into a puddle of Water they cannot fly out again, for want of moi&s;ture in their Wings.</P>

<P>AT this I&s;land of <HI>Juan Fernando</HI>'s we wooded, water'd, heel'd and refitted our Ships. Here Captain <HI>Stradling</HI> and his Crew having &s;ome difference, they to the number of forty two went on &s;hoar;

<P>This I&s;land is &s;o called from the fir&s;t Di&s;coverer of it, who was a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> na|med <HI>Juan</HI> or <HI>John Fernando.</HI> It is about fourteen Leagues round; full of high Hills, and &s;mall plea&s;ant Valleys. The Woods afford &s;everal &s;orts of Trees, but none fit for Ma&s;ts. Here are <HI>Pamento</HI>-Trees in a|bundance, but the Spice was not ripe whil&s;t we were here: Al&s;o abundance of <HI>Cabbage-trees,</HI> altho &s;mall, yet very good and &s;weet.</P>
<P>The Cabbage-tree<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XI.</NOTE> is of Body &s;mall and &s;treight, with &s;everal Knots or Joynts about four Inches from each other, like a Bamboe-Cane, void of any Leaves, except at the top; in the mid&s;t of which, the Cabbage is contained; which when boiled, is as good as any Garden-Cabbage I ever ta&s;ted. The Branches are commonly a|bout twelve or thirteen Feet in length, and about a foot and an half from the Trunk of the Tree they &s;hoot forth Leaves, about four foot long, and an Inch and a half broad. The&s;e Leaves grow &s;o regu|larly that the whole Branch &s;eems but one entire Leaf. The Cabbage when it is cut out from among&s;t the bottoms of the

At the bot|tom of the Cabbage grow great Bunches of Berries, of about &s;ix pound weight, in the &s;hape of a bunch of Grapes. Their Colour is red like a Cherry; and the Ber|ries are about the bigne&s;s of a black Cher|ry, with a large Stone in the middle; and they ta&s;te much like <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Haws. We never climb up to get the Fruit or Cabbage, be|cau&s;e the Tree is &s;o high, and there is not any thing to hold by; &s;o that a Man would find it a hard matter to get up. For I have &s;een &s;ome of the&s;e Trees, after we we have cut them down (which we always do to get the Cabbage) to be ninety or a hundred Feet in length.</P>
<P>There are in this I&s;land a great many <HI>Wild-Cats,</HI> of the fine&s;t Colour I ever &s;aw, which were put a&s;hoar here (as I &s;uppo&s;e) by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to de&s;troy the Goats: But their Project has not taken effect; for here are va&s;t numbers of <HI>Goals.</HI> The old ones, both Male and Female, take turns to guard their Young; &s;o that the Cats dur&s;t not venture upon the Young, the old ones being always their Guard. I wonder the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hould think that by &s;etting Cats a&s;hoar here, they &s;hould de&s;troy the Goats; when at the &s;ame time there are &s;uch va&s;t numbers of <HI>Seales</HI> both young
<PB N="20" REF="50">
<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"> and old, on whom the Cats may more ea&s;ily prey, becau&s;e they cannot &s;o well defend their young as the Goats do: I have heard of mad Dogs being put a&s;hoar here by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for the &s;ame intent, but never &s;aw any. Yet if they were, I am apt to believe they would rather prey upon the Seals than the Goats.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Goats,</HI> as I &s;aid before, here is great plenty, and e&s;pecially towards the We&s;t part of the I&s;land; they re&s;ort thither, by rea&s;on there is better Pa&s;ture for them. Of the&s;e Goats we u&s;ed to get &s;tore; and a Joint of one of them roa&s;ted, with about half a foot of our Cabbage boiled makes a very good Meal.

<P>Birds here are few or none of Note, ex|cept the <HI>Humming-Bird,</HI> which is about the bigne&s;s of a Bee. It hath a Bill no bigger than an ordinary Pin; his Legs are &s;mall, but in proportion to his Bulk; his Feathers are very &s;mall, and mo&s;tly black. We &s;eldom u&s;ed to catch or &s;ee the&s;e Birds, unle&s;s toward Evening; and then they would come humming about us: But if it was dark, and we had a Fire, before Mor|ning we &s;hould have a hundred of them fly into the Fire.</P>
<P>Of the Sea Inhabitants here are <HI>Seals</HI> in &s;uch abundance, that without driving them away, there is no going a&s;hoar. Here are al&s;o a great many <HI>Sea-Lyons;</HI> and for Cavallies, Silver-fi&s;h, Groopers, Breams and Craw-fi&s;h, here is &s;uch great plenty, that it is almo&s;t incredible.</P>
<P>The Sea-Lyon is &s;o called (as I conje|cture) becau&s;e his roaring is not unlike
<PB N="22" REF="52">
<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"> that of the Lyon; the Head likewi&s;e much re&s;embles the Lyon. He hath four large Teeth before; the re&s;t thick, &s;hort and &s;tubbed. In this he is like the Lyon; in all other parts quite different; He hath four Fins; the two foremo&s;t &s;erve him, when he goes a&s;hoar, to rai&s;e the fore-part of his Body, and then he draws the hinder-part after him; the two hinder Fins are of no u&s;e to him on Land, but only in the Wa|ter. The&s;e Creatures are very fat; for which rea&s;on we kill'd &s;everal of them, and &s;oon made us a Tun of Oil for our Lamps; although mo&s;t of us, whil&s;t we were here, made u&s;e of it in frying of Fi&s;h; and indeed it had no unplea&s;ant ta&s;te. We killed one which was twenty three Feet in length, fourteen foot and a half round, and cut &s;eventeen Inches deep in fat. They have &s;hort Hair, of a light Colour, but lighter when young, than old; For when old, they look more &s;an|dy. Their Food is Fi&s;h; for their prey is all in the Water, though they generally come on Land to &s;leep; and then five, &s;ix or &s;even of them will huddle together like Swine, and lie &s;o three or four Days if not mole&s;ted. They are very much afraid of a Man; and &s;o &s;oon as they &s;ee him any thing near, they will make to the Wa|ter; for they never go far from it. If they are hard pur&s;ued, they will turn about and
<PB N="23" REF="53">
<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"> rai&s;e their Body up with their Fore-fins, and face you, &s;tanding with their Mouth wide open upon their Guard: So that when we wanted to kill one, to make Oil, we u&s;ed commonly to clap a Pi&s;tol ju&s;t to his Mouth, as it &s;tood open, and fire it down his Throat; But if we had a mind to have &s;ome Sport with him, which we called Lyon-baiting; u&s;ually &s;ix, &s;even or eight, or more of us, would go with each a half Pike in his Hand, and &s;o prick him to Death; which commonly would be a Sport for two or three Hours before we could conquer him. And often times he would find us work enough. But he being an unweildy Creature; and we a&s;&s;aulting him both behind, before, and all round; we mu&s;t needs conquer. Yet he often put us to the run; and &s;ometimes he would run him&s;elf, but knew not which way, for we commonly got beeween the Water and him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seals</HI> are much of the &s;ame kind; only their Heads are like a Hounds. They howl like Dogs, when old; and bark like them, when young. They have a very fine Furr; the fine&s;t, next the Sable, I ever &s;aw. Some of them are of a bright Silver|colour, &s;ome of a Che&s;t-nut. They feed as the Sea-lion, being Both amphibious Creatures; and &s;leep like them; only when they go, their hinder as well as fore-fins
<PB N="24" REF="54">
<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"> are of u&s;e to them. They are about the bigne&s;s of a large Ma&s;tiff. They are very fat, but not the be&s;t Victuals. When they come out of the Sea, they bleat like Sheep for their Young; which, though they are to pa&s;s through Thou&s;ands both young and old, yet will find out their own Damm to &s;uck; For none of them will &s;uffer any Young to &s;uck them, but only their own. Both young and old love much to lie a&s;hoar; but when beaten by us, they make to the Sea; and a &s;mall blow on the No&s;e &s;oon kills them. I have eaten of the&s;e Seals often, but it was to &s;ave better Victuals; however they eat to|lerably well, to tho&s;e that are very hun|gry and have no other Meat. The Lean of the Fle&s;h is black, and of a cour&s;e Grain.</P>

Accordingly we &s;tood away towards the &s;aid I&s;land; and on the 3d &s;aw the I&s;land bearing South, di&s;tant about nine or ten Leagues.

Be&s;ides, we did not que&s;tion the ta|king of her, becau&s;e now our Men were all in Health, whereas when we fought her before, we had between twenty and thirty Men very &s;ick and weak; but being wil|ling to &s;how them&s;elves, they had done what good they could. We knew al&s;o, if we took her, that &s;he mu&s;t needs prove a good Prize: And her Guns, Ammunition, and Provi&s;ions, would have been very welcome to us.

<P>This Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> lies in the Latitude of 5 d. N.

By Day-light the next Morning, as we lay at anchor, the Tide of Ebb not being done, a Canoa with five <HI>Indians</HI> came within call of us.

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"> were a&s;&s;aulted by three Ambu&s;cades, in which one of our Men was killed, and &s;e|veral wounded; that our Men beat them from their Ambu&s;cades, and would wil|lingly have put a&s;hoar; but Captain <HI>Dam|pier</HI> advis'd, that &s;ince the <HI>Spaniards</HI> knew of our coming, and had had &s;o much time as to provide Ambu&s;cades for us, it could not be doubted but they had made the be&s;t u&s;e of their time, and had taken care to con|vey their Wives and Children and all that was valuable, out of the Town; which is always the fir&s;t thing they do when they hear of an Enemy: So it was re&s;olved to return to us at <HI>Schuchadero.</HI> And on <HI>May</HI> the 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> betimes in the Morning, we left <HI>Schuchadero,</HI> and went down the River in order to return on board our Ships, which we left at Anchor at Point <HI>Garachina.</HI></P>

We &s;oon got up our Anchor, and took her without any re&s;i&s;tance. This was a great Ship, of about 550 Tuns. She was deep|ly laden with Flower, Sugar, Brandy, Wine, about 30 Tuns of Marmalet of Quinces, a con&s;iderable quantity of Salt,

<P>From hence we &s;tood to the Southward, and on the 11th fell in with Point <HI>Saint Hellena.</HI> This Point is di&s;tant from the I&s;land of <HI>Plata</HI> eighteen Leagues.

<P>On the 21&s;t we &s;aw a Sail, and &s;tood towards her; and next day, being <HI>July</HI> the 22d, came up with her. She proved to be one of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Men of War which was fitted out on purpo&s;e to take us. This was the Ship of thirty two Guns. We being pretty near each other, they gave us a broad-&s;ide, but we did not mind them; all our care was to get the Wea|ther-gage. In order to which, while we carried too much Sail, and the Wind blew very fre&s;h, our fore-top Ma&s;t unfortunate|ly came by the board. Immediately we got our Hatchets and cut all clear way, and our Captain ordered the Helm to be clapt a Weather and bore away. The Enemy &s;eeing this, immediately bore away after us with all the Sail they could, ho|ping to come up and take us; for now they doubted not but they &s;hould take us. We ob&s;erving that our running had increa|&s;ed their Courage, re&s;olved thereupon to lie by, and fight it out. Captain <HI>Dampier</HI>'s Opinion was, that we could &s;ail better upon one Ma&s;t than the Enemy; and therefore that it was be&s;t to put before the Wind. But however we being em|bayed, cho&s;e rather to fight, than to be cha&s;ed a&s;hoar. So hoi&s;ting the bloody Flag at our Main-top-ma&s;t Head, with a

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"> re&s;olution neither to give nor take Quarter, we began the fight, and went to it as fa&s;t as we could load and fire. The Enemy kept to windward at a good di&s;tance from us, &s;o that we could not come to make u&s;e of our &s;mall Arms; But we divided the two Watches, and one was to manage the great Guns, whil&s;t the other looked on; and when tho&s;e at the great Guns were weary, the other were to take their places, till they had refre&s;h'd them&s;elves. Thus we fired, I believe, five Guns to his one. We fired about 560, and he about 110 or 115; and we fought him from twelve at Noon to half an hour pa&s;t &s;ix at Night, although at a good di&s;tance; for he kept &s;o far to windward of us, that our &s;hot &s;ometimes would hardly reach him, tho' his would at the &s;ame time fly over us. At half an hour pa&s;t &s;ix, it growing duski&s;h, they left off firing, and we did the &s;ame. We had by good Providence none of our Men either kill'd or wounded by the Ene|my; only two thro' carele&s;ne&s;s had their Hands and Faces bla&s;ted; but in a &s;mall time they both recovered. After our fight was over, we got a &s;pare Main-top-ma&s;t which we had between Decks; and our Carpenters went to work to fix it; it be|ing of it &s;elf too big for a Fore top-Ma&s;t.

<P>This Point is low towards the Sea-&s;ide, and plain even Ground on the top. You mu&s;t &s;teer N.

And in the Point is a Bay of Sand, which you may &s;ee when you come in with your Ship within the Point; and coming over the &s;aid Bay, you will &s;ee a little Lake of fre&s;h Water running into the Sea; and when the Tide is at the highe&s;t, the Salt Water runs into it. Wherefore if you would take in fre&s;h Water here, you mu&s;t take care to go to the right of the &s;aid Spring, and you will come to the Head of it, where you will find excellent good Water in a Pond, near unto a plea&s;ant Grove of Trees, about a Musket-&s;hot with|in Land.

<P>We pa&s;&s;ed by this Point of <HI>Gallera,</HI> and the &s;ame Day anchored in the Bay of <HI>Ta|cames;</HI> which was the place whereto we were bound, and is di&s;tant from the Point of <HI>Gallera</HI> between two and three Leagues. We anchored at this <HI>Tacames</HI> in &s;ix fathom Water, Point <HI>Gallera</HI> bearing VV. S. VV. di&s;tant between two and three Leagues. At our coming in, we &s;ent our Boat a&s;hore with twenty Men armed, hoping to get &s;ome Provi&s;ions; but the Inhabitants ha|ving notice of an Enemy's being in tho&s;e Seas, as &s;oon as they &s;aw us, drove the Cattle from the VVater-&s;ide up into the Country, and they them&s;elves retired to the Mountains with their VVives and Chil|dren and all they had. So our Men went into the Village, which con&s;i&s;ted of about fifty <HI>Indian</HI> Hou&s;es, de&s;erted by the Inha|bitants. Here in the River we found a Bark upon the Stocks a building, of about fifty Tuns; with new Plank enough by her, to build another.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FROM the Bay of <HI>Tacames</HI> in the La|titude of about 1 d. 20 m. North, we &s;tood away to the N. W. a-cro&s;s the Bay of <HI>Panama;</HI> and on the 30th of <HI>Au|gu&s;t</HI> we fell in with an I&s;land, which pro|ved to be the I&s;land <HI>Caneo.</HI> It is an indif|ferent high I&s;land, and lies in the Latitude of 10d. N. It is not above a League round. and the anchoring-place is on the N. E, &s;ide, in 14 fadom Water, not above a quar|ter of a Mile from the Shore. Here is &s;aid by our <HI>Indian</HI> Pilots to be extraordinary good Wood, VVater, Turtle, and &s;tore of wild Hogs. Near this I&s;land are two I|&s;lands more; and between them are &s;eve|ral Shoals; and not far off, upon the main Land, is <HI>Punta-mala</HI> or bad Point; and within <HI>Punta-mala</HI> is a fine deep Bay, in which Sir <HI>Thomas Cavendi&s;h</HI> formerly clean'd his Ship.</P>
<P>From hence we coa&s;ted away to the VVe&s;tward, and pa&s;t by the <HI>Sierras de los Coronadas,</HI> or the Crowned Mountains. The&s;e Mountains are very remarkable, there being none like them on this Coa&s;t. From
<PB N="65" REF="96">
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"> the Crowned Mountains we &s;till coa&s;ted a|way to the VVe&s;tward, and pa&s;&s;ed by the four Rocks, called by the <HI>Spaniards, Fa|rallones de Queipo.</HI> The&s;e Rocks lie ju&s;t at the VVe&s;t-end of the Crowned Moun|tains; and the Coa&s;t runs N. N. VV. and S. S. E. Near the&s;e Rocks is the River <HI>E|&s;trella,</HI> or the Star River. This River is in the bottom of a large Bay, and here is commonly a great Sea. From this Bay to <HI>Herradura</HI> is 11 Leagues. <HI>Herradura</HI> is the South Point that makes the Gulf of <HI>Ni|coya,</HI> as <HI>Cape Blanco</HI> is the North. VVe arrived at <HI>Herradura</HI> on the 16 of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> but pa&s;t by it, and went further into the Gulf, till we came to many &s;mall I&s;lands, called by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> the <HI>Middle I&s;lands</HI> becau&s;e they lie in the middle of the Gulf. VVe anchor'd between <HI>Them</HI> and the Bay of <HI>Caldera;</HI> bringing the Bay of <HI>Caldera</HI> to bear Ea&s;t, and the &s;aid <HI>Middle I&s;lands</HI> to bear VVe&s;t. Here we lay all this day; but &s;ent our little Prize the <HI>Dragon</HI> to view the Gulf, and to find out a convenient place to lay our Ship a&s;hore in. And the next Mor|ning being <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 17th, our Captain and Carpenter went in the Canoa among&s;t the <HI>Middle I&s;lands,</HI> to &s;ee if there was any convenience among&s;t <HI>Them</HI> for laying our Ship a-ground. In the Evening our Cap|tain and Carpenter returned in the Canoa, and brought on board two Turtles, which

We pre&s;ently went to work in cutting up the Turtle, boiling, roa&s;ting, frying, ba|king, and &s;tewing, according as each one thought fit. Our Captain and Car|penter had, as they &s;aid, found out a con|venient place to lay our Ship a&s;hore, among&s;t the&s;e middle I&s;lands. So we intended to lie here this Night, and, if it was fair, to go in on the morrow.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Evening our little Prize re|turned to us again.

In their way they caught eight Turtles, and eat nothing of their own Provi&s;ions, but fed upon Turtle du|ring the Time they were from us; They gave us an account that they had found out a very good and &s;ecure place at the I&s;land St <HI>Lucas,</HI> for us to lay our Ship a+&s;hore in; That it was in a fine deep Bay&punc; which at the entrance was not above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pi&s;tol-&s;hot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> over: That with five or &s;ix Guns upon each Point at the Entrance, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> might &s;o fortifie our &s;elves, as that no Enemy dur&s;t approach us; for that ten o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> us might de&s;end our &s;elves again&s;t fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">

However we found the <HI>Middle I&s;lands</HI> to be as convenient as any place could be: And our Captain &s;eeming to like this place as well, and knowing we could fortifie our &s;elves as &s;trongly here and with as little trouble; we cho&s;e this place: Accordingly on the 18th, it being fair Weather and calm, we towed our Ship in among&s;t the I&s;lands, and lay with|in Stones ca&s;t of the Shore all round, with one Anchor a Head, and a Cable out at our Stern, which was made fa&s;t to a great Tree on the Shore. As &s;oon as we had fa&s;tened our Ship, all Hands went a&s;hore and began to build Tents for our Cooper and Sail-maker to work in, and to put our Goods and Provi&s;ions in. In the mean time our chief Mate was &s;ent in the little <HI>Dragon</HI> with twenty Men armed, and two Pattereroes, to cruize in the Gulf; where after he had cruized five or &s;ix Days, he returned with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Bark of about forty Tuns: She had in her &s;ome few Jars of Brandy, Wine, and &s;ome Sugar. They were going to repair her, &s;he being very old; and for that purpo&s;e had five or &s;ix Carpenters and Caukers on board, who came very opportunely to help us to re|pair our Ship, for we had great need of Workmen. We took out our Powder, Shot and all our Ammunition; with all our Bread, &s;ome of our Flower, and our
<PB N="68" REF="101">
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"> two Quarter-deck Guns; and put them on board this la&s;t Bark. Then we got all the re&s;t of our things a&s;hore, and made every thing ready for cleaning our Ship. Our Men went a&s;hore often with the Sain, and caught &s;tore of Fi&s;h, e&s;pecially if they took the right time, which was at the Flood, and better in the Night than in the Day. The 22d of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> we &s;ent our Canoas to an I&s;land ju&s;t by us, upon which there were &s;everal old fallen-down Hou&s;es; the Thatch of which we brought away to make u&s;e of in burning the bottom of our Ship. The bottom of our Ship was in many places eaten like a Honey-Comb; in&s;omuch that the firm Plank was no thick|er than an old Six-pence: Nay, in &s;ome places in the Hold, we could thru&s;t our Thumbs quite through with ea&s;e.

<P>The <HI>Pearl-Oy&s;ter</HI> is much about the big|ne&s;s of our common Oy&s;ter, but more flat and broad. It hangs to the Rocks by a long &s;tringy Beard, like a Mu&s;cle.

The Vulcan of Fire, which &s;tands oppo&s;ite to that of Water, is at &s;ome certain times (e&s;pecially in the rainy Sea&s;on, which is from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>November,</HI>) very terrible to the Inhabi|tants. It &s;ometimes throws out Stones as big as a Hou&s;e; and breaks out with &s;uch a Flame, that if it be in a dark Night, al|though you be five or &s;ix Miles of, yet by the Light thereof you may &s;ee to read a Letter written in a &s;mall Hand. This was affirmed to us by &s;everal of our Pri&s;oners, Natives of the place.</P>
<P>The 8th, we had dirty &s;qually Weather, with very hard Gu&s;ts of Wind from the two Vulcans afore&s;aid; with &s;uch prodigious Claps of Thunder and Fla&s;hes of Lightning, as none of us ever &s;aw or heard the like.

Capt. <HI>Martin,</HI> whom I formerly mentioned, was then a Pri&s;oner on board us: He advi&s;ed to lay her aboard immediately, while they were all in a hurry, and that this would be the only way to take her; but
<PB N="84" REF="119">
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"> if we gave them &s;o much time as to get out their great Guns, they would certain|ly beat us in pieces, and we &s;hould lo&s;e an opportunity of making our &s;elves ma|&s;ters of the value of &s;ixteen Millions of Pieces of Eight. And accordingly it hap|pened: For time being delayed in quar|relling, between tho&s;e of us that would lay her aboard, and tho&s;e that would not, the Enemy got out a tire of Guns, and then were too hard for us; &s;o that we could not lie along her &s;ide, to do her any con&s;iderable damage.

<P>Thus our De&s;ign being di&s;appointed, all our Men grew di&s;contented, and were for going Home; knowing we could do no good in the&s;e Parts, either for our &s;elves or Owners; having Provi&s;ion but for three Months, and that very &s;hort; and our

<P>The Cocoa-Tree is &s;mall, and the Nut or Kernel bigger than an Almond; and ripens in a great Husk, wherein are &s;ome|times 30, nay 40 Cocoas.

<P>AT the Point <HI>de Chaine</HI> begins the great Bay of <HI>Panama;</HI> which is the great|e&s;t Sea-port, next <HI>Lima,</HI> of any on the We&s;t-&s;ide of this great Continent of <HI>Ame|rica.</HI> It is &s;aid to have eight Pari&s;h Chur|ches, thirty &s;mall Chappels, and to con|tain &s;ix Thou&s;and and five Hundred Hou&s;es, mo&s;t of them well built of Brick and Stone. It is very well fortified, and walled all round with Stone: The City is governed by a Pre&s;ident under the Vice|roy of <HI>Peru;</HI> it being part of his Territo|ries. On the back-&s;ide of the City, is a very plea&s;ant and fruitful Country. The Land is not very high, but full of &s;mall Hills, and fine plea&s;ant Valleys, in which there are &s;everal fine Gardens of &s;everal &s;orts of Fruit. This is a place of the greate&s;t Trade of any in the South
<PB N="147" REF="190">
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"> Seas, not excepting even <HI>Lima</HI> the Metro|polis. For this City has the conveniency of Trade both from the North and South Sea: From the North Sea, it receives all or mo&s;t of the <HI>European</HI> Goods which are brought by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to <HI>Portobel</HI> or <HI>Carthagena,</HI> or by any other Nation trading on the North-&s;ide: And the&s;e <HI>European</HI> Goods are from hence by &s;hip|ping in the South Sea &s;ent to <HI>Guiaquill, Truxillo, Lima, Arica, Coquimbo, Gova|nadore, Valpirizo</HI> and <HI>Valdivia,</HI> with &s;eve|ral other noted places; from whence they return back richly laden with the Commo|dities of the&s;e Parts. But now the <HI>French</HI> having a trade among&s;t them, and &s;upply|ing them with all <HI>European</HI> Nece&s;&s;aries, it hinders this City mightily; and the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> as far as we could hear, whil&s;t we were in the&s;e Parts, had rather have their room than their Company. However the <HI>French</HI> at pre&s;ent make very great and pro|fitable Voyages; and now that they find the &s;weet of it, they will be &s;ure, if they can, to &s;ettle a firm and la&s;ting Trade here. For, as we have been a&s;&s;ured by &s;everal <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captains whom we took, they have made better than 5000 <HI>per Cent.</HI> of their Goods, one with another. This City &s;tood formerly four Miles to the Ea&s;t|ward of the place where it now &s;tands; But it being taken and kept a Month by
<PB N="148" REF="191">
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"> Sir <HI>Henry Morgan,</HI> and by misfortune burnt three times &s;ince; they thought the place unlucky, and &s;o built it by the Sea|&s;ide where it now &s;tands. It is now much larger, &s;tronger and better built, than it was before. The Port of <HI>Perica</HI> is the Harbour for <HI>Panama;</HI> but di&s;tant from it three Miles. For the great ebbing and &s;hoalne&s;s of the Water, will not &s;uffer any great Ship to come any nearer than the &s;aid I&s;land of <HI>Perica,</HI> which is far out of Command of their Guns at <HI>Pa|nama:</HI> Therefore &s;hipping may ea&s;ily be taken out. But although great Ships are forced to lie here, yet &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els run through a little Creek clo&s;e up to the City.</P>
<P>From <HI>Panama</HI> to the I&s;land <HI>Tabago,</HI> is between five and &s;ix Leagues, and they bear nearly North and South from each other. This I&s;land of <HI>Tabago,</HI> is in length one league, in breadth about half a league. The I&s;land is high and mountainous, but highe&s;t at the South end. It is very well clothed with Trees of &s;everal &s;orts; and on it are &s;everal Walks of <HI>Plantains, Bo|nanoes, Coco-nuts,</HI> &amp;c. which they &s;end to &s;ell at <HI>Panama.</HI> Upon this I&s;land, on the North-&s;ide, is a &s;mall Village of thatcht Hou&s;es, inhabited by <HI>Negroes,</HI> who are Slaves to the Gentlemen at <HI>Panama,</HI> and are kept here on purpo&s;e to look after their

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"> Walks of Fruit. Right again&s;t the &s;aid &s;mall Village is the common anchoring place, in which there is tolerable good anchoring in &s;eventeen or eighteen fa|thom Water. There are two other &s;mall I&s;lands ju&s;t by it; They are both very well clothed wth Woods; aad on them are &s;ome few <HI>Negroes,</HI> as there is upon mo&s;t or all of the&s;e I&s;lands in the Bay of <HI>Panama.</HI></P>
<P>To the South Ea&s;t of the&s;e <HI>I&s;lands</HI> is a great range of I&s;lands, called the <HI>Kings I&s;lands;</HI> they are mo&s;t of them pretty low and plea&s;ant I&s;lands, and very well clo|thed with tall &s;treight Trees of &s;everal &s;orts. About them are a great many very good anchoring places; and upon mo&s;t of them is good Wood, Water and Fruit. They are in all about forty in number. On the great I&s;land called the <HI>Kings I&s;land</HI> (which gives name to all the re&s;t) the <HI>Spaniards</HI> build good Ve&s;&s;els, which are commonly counted pretty good Sailers. You mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that among&s;t the&s;e I&s;lands you will hardly find much more or le&s;s than &s;ixty fathom Water, unle&s;s you are very near them. Among&s;t the&s;e I|&s;lands the Water ri&s;es and falls ten foot perpendicular.</P>
<P>From <HI>Panama</HI> to the I&s;land <HI>Chepelio,</HI> is eight Leagues. Upon this I&s;land are &s;ome <HI>Mullattoes</HI> and <HI>Negroes,</HI> belonging to the

Right again&s;t this I&s;land, on the Main, is a large River called <HI>Cheapo;</HI> and &s;even Leagues up the &s;aid River, is a Town of the &s;ame Name, which is very plentiful of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>From <HI>Chepelio</HI> to the I&s;land of <HI>Planta,</HI> is &s;even leagues. It lies a league from the Main, and the water about it is indiffe|rently deep; but near the Main it is all a|long &s;hole water, not above four Foot, though you be a league from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>From hence to <HI>Cape Saint Lorenzo,</HI> is ten leagues. This Cape is low Land, full of Creeks; and near it, is &s;hole water. At this Cape begins the Gulf of St <HI>Micha|el,</HI> in which are a great many I&s;lands, Ri|vers and Sholes; although in &s;ome places the Water is deep and &s;mooth, and good anchoring. It was up one of the&s;e Rivers that we went, de&s;igning to take the Town of <HI>Santa Maria;</HI> but were fru&s;trated of our intent: Yet we took an <HI>Indian</HI> Town, which we called <HI>Scuchadero.</HI> It was about three leagues within the Mouth of the Ri|ver, and &s;ituated on the South-&s;ide of it. In it we found &s;tore of Dunghil-Fowls, Parrots, white and black Beans, Yams, Potatoes, Maiz, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ted of about

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"> two hundred and fifty Hou&s;es; and round about the Town were great Walks of Fruit, as Plantains, Bonanoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There is an|other Town on the North-&s;ide of the Ri|ver, called <HI>Scuchadero,</HI> which Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> mentions in his Fir&s;t Vol. <HI>p.</HI> 195; But this we could not find, and &s;o gave the other Town its name; and from thence returned on board our Ships again, which we left lying at Point <HI>Garachina,</HI> which Point I make to lie in the Latitude of 7 d. 20 m.

<P>From Point <HI>Garachina</HI> to Port <HI>Pinas,</HI> is &s;even leagues, North and South. The Port of <HI>Pinas</HI> has two &s;mall I&s;lands at the Mouth of it; But, if you plea&s;e, you may &s;ail clo&s;e by them; for there is no danger; neither is there le&s;s than twelve or fourteen Fathom water. At this place is good wooding and watering. The Land is high and very woody, and goes up hol|low in the middle. It is very full of Pine-Trees, and thence called Port <HI>Pinas.</HI> In &s;ome part of this Port, is good anchoring; and in the Port are three Rivers of fre&s;h water; and the Banks of the Rivers are full of tall &s;treight Trees. The Port lies in the Latitude of 7 d. North. Longitude from <HI>London</HI> We&s;t, 82 d. 00 m. And a

The Land here, is not &s;o high as at Port <HI>Pinas;</HI> but in many places here are very plea&s;ant Walks of Coco-nuts. The Coa&s;t is very deep and dangerous in Winter-time. At the bottom of Port <HI>Quemado,</HI> are two Ri|vers of fre&s;h water; and at the entrance of the Port, both on the North and South &s;ide, are &s;everal &s;mall I&s;lands, or rather Rocks: Keep mid-way between both Points, and you may go in very &s;ecurely.

<P>A little to the Southward of this Port of <HI>Quemado,</HI> is the Port of <HI>Santa Clara.</HI> Off this Port lie four Rocks; and in the mid|dle of it is a &s;mall River.

<P>From Port St <HI>Clara</HI> to the Bay of Saint <HI>Antonio,</HI> is five leagues, all very low Land, which in the rainy time is covered with water; only the tops of the Trees to be &s;een. Along the &s;hore are a great many &s;mall I&s;lands, Rocks and Sholes; There|fore,

It is but bad going into this Bay, by rea|&s;on of a great &s;hole of Sand, which runs a great way into the Sea from its North-Point; And when you are in, you lie o|pen to the South, the South We&s;t, and o|ther we&s;terly Winds.</P>

<P>The Point of <HI>Gallera</HI> is a low Point; and off it lie many Rocks and Sholes. You may know the Point by this, that there are two white Cliffs upon it, near the Water-&s;ide.</P>
<P>From Point <HI>Gallera</HI> to Cape St <HI>Franci&s;|co,</HI> is two Leagues. It is a high Cape, but far higher within Land than near the Water-&s;ide.

This Cape is famous for the rich Prize, named the <HI>Cacafogo,</HI> taken ju&s;t off it by Sir <HI>Francis Drake:</HI> in which was &s;aid to be eighty Pound-weight of refined Gold, twenty-&s;ix Tuns of Silver, with a con&s;iderable quantity of Jewels.

But to the Southward of this Cape, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> con&s;tantly affirm there are no Worms: For tho&s;e Ships which trade on|ly on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili,</HI> and never go to Northward of this Cape, are never Worm-eaten. This Cape is, as I may &s;ay, the bounds of the rainy and bad Weather; it &s;eldom reaching to the Southward of it, unle&s;s by chance, per|haps not one Year in twenty. I have once heard that the Rains came up as high as <HI>Paita,</HI> which lies in the Latitude of 5 d. 15 m. S. and is 6 d. 15 m. to the South|ward of this Cape of St <HI>Franci&s;co:</HI> But this was but by chance; and I never heard from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that ever it went &s;o high up, excepting that one time, in any of their Memories.</P>
<P>This Cape of St <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> hath, at the pitch of it, a &s;mall Rock. The Coa&s;t here, runs away more to the South Ea&s;t|ward. About three Leagues di&s;tance from the Cape is a &s;mall Port, called <HI>Apottete;</HI> near which, is a round Hill, behind which is good Wood and Water; and near it, is

<P>From <HI>Appottete</HI> to the fir&s;t River of <HI>Cogimes,</HI> is three Leagues. There are three Rivers of this Name, and they lie clo&s;e one by the other.

But to windward of the &s;aid three Rivers, you may come nearer the Land: Yet it is all along not very deep to <HI>Coaque.</HI></P>
<P>A little to the Southward of the Sou|thermo&s;t of the&s;e three Rivers, is a &s;mall and barren I&s;land, right again&s;t which are the Mountains of <HI>Coaque:</HI> The&s;e are very high Mountains, covered with large and tall Trees; at the foot of which is a &s;mall Village of <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> called by the Name of St <HI>John's</HI> Village; and near the Village is the River of <HI>Coaque,</HI> which runs a great way up into the Country.</P>

The Bay of <HI>Baciabo</HI> (which is about a Mile to the Southward of the River of <HI>Sama,</HI>) is a pretty deep Bay: At the bottom of it are a great many white Clifts, which are &s;up|po&s;ed to lie directly under the Equator. The Bay is rocky all round; and at each of its Points are &s;ome very dangerous Sands, which &s;tretch four or five Miles off to the Sea. From hence to the Cape <HI>Pa&s;|&s;ao,</HI> is about five Leagues: In all which way are many &s;mall Points and Bays; mo&s;t of which are very well clothed with &s;everal &s;orts of Trees, tall and &s;treight, and of various Shapes and Colours. And the Land is of an indifferent height. This Cape <HI>Pa&s;&s;ao</HI> is a high round Cape, with but few Trees on it. It lies in the Latit. of 00d. 08 m. South, Longitude from <HI>London</HI> We&s;t 82 d. 40 m. and we found variation here 3 d. 33 m. We&s;terly.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AND now having given a particular De&s;cription of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexico, Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili</HI> (from the Tropic of <HI>Cancer</HI> to 40 d. South) as far as we ob&s;erved our &s;elves or could learn from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> I &s;hall return to the Gulf of <HI>Amapalla,</HI> where we were fitting our Ve&s;&s;el in order to our intended Voyage for <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>Here therefore we went a&s;hore at the I|&s;land <HI>Conchagua,</HI> to &s;eek for water; and after &s;ome &s;earch, we found behind the Hills a large bottom, in which was a large Plantain-walk, and a great deal of Rain|water, that fell from the Mountains. This was very inconvenient for us, becau&s;e ly|ing &s;o behind the Hills, we knew we mu&s;t be forced to carry all our water over a high Hill, which we could hardly climb by our &s;elves: But &s;eeing there was no remedy, we fir&s;t cut down the Bu&s;hes which were in our way, to make us a clear Path; Af|ter which, the Hill being pretty &s;teep on the Land-&s;ide, towards the bottom, where|in was the fre&s;h water; we with our Axes and Shovels cut out &s;teps in the Hill: And our Sail-maker having in the mean time made us a Canvas-Pipe of about ninety fa|thom
<PB N="220" REF="263">
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"> long, to carry our water from the top of the Hill down to our Cask which lay at the foot of it; we went to work to fill our water; each Man having with him a &s;ix Gallon Cask. The water which we took up was very muddy; and on the top of it grew Duck-weed, as it does u&s;ually in our Ditches. At fir&s;t we raked the Duck-weed away: But our Doctor per|&s;wading us, that if we took up the weeds, they would mightily pre&s;erve our water; we, according to his advice, took up both weeds and water together. When each Man had filled his &s;ix Gallon Cask, he car|ried it up to the top of the Hill, and then poured it into the Canvas-Pipe, which conveyed it down the Hill into our Cask. Thus we employed our &s;elves for four days. And having filled about twenty-five Tuns, which we concluded would la&s;t lon|ger than our Victuals; and got it on board our Ve&s;&s;el; the next day, being the 31&s;t of <HI>January</HI> 1704/5, we all went a&s;hore to the Plantain-walk: And having cut down a &s;ufficient quantity of them, we returned at night on board our Ve&s;&s;el, intending to &s;ail next day. This Evening two of our Men who had re&s;olved to &s;tay with Cap|tain <HI>Dampier,</HI> left him and came over to us; &s;o that now we were 35 in number, <HI>viz.</HI> thirty-four <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and one little <HI>Ne|gro</HI> Boy, whom we had taken from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="264">
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"> During the time of our watering our Bark, the Men on board the Ship belong|ing to Captain <HI>Dampier,</HI> were bu&s;ie in re|fitting their Ship as well as they could: The Carpenter &s;topt the Shot-holes, which they had in their Powder-room, with Tal|low and Charcoal; not daring, as he &s;aid, to drive in a Nail, for fear of making it wor&s;e: And the four great Guns, which u&s;ually &s;tood between Decks, were put down into the Hold; there being &s;ix|teen be&s;ides, which was more than they had Men to manage; for there remained with them no more than twenty-eight Men and Boys, and mo&s;t of them Land|men.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of <HI>February,</HI> 1704/5, we left the Gulf of <HI>Amapalla,</HI> and Captain <HI>Dam|pier</HI> in his Ship the St <HI>George</HI> at anchor in it. We &s;teered out between the I&s;land of <HI>Amapalla</HI> and the I&s;land <HI>Mangera;</HI> and many times had not above two fathom Water. We had a fine Gale of Wind at N. E. which &s;oon carryed us out of the Mouth of the Gulf. So long as we had been in any of the Harbours on this Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexico,</HI> we had &s;eldom been allowed any thing but Flower; Excepting that we u&s;ed to go a&s;hore, and found upon the Rocks &s;tore of Conchs, Oy&s;ters, Mu&s;cles, Snails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which we made many a good Meal: But now being in hopes of
<PB N="222" REF="265">
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"> getting into a Land of Plenty, we bore Hunger with more patience. And indeed we had great need of Patience. For now our Commons was le&s;&s;ened to half a pound of cour&s;e Flower a Man <HI>per</HI> Day, with two Ounces of Salt-Meat every other Day. Our Ve&s;&s;el was a &s;mall Bark with two Ma&s;ts, of about &s;eventy Tuns, which we had taken from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> But whil&s;t we lay here, &s;he was &s;o eaten by the Worms, that &s;he begun to grow very leaky; and to add to our Afflictions, we had no Carpenter; neither if any of us &s;hould fall &s;ick, had we any Doctor, or any Me|dicines to make u&s;e of; And, which was wor&s;t of all, we had no Boat to a&s;&s;i&s;t our &s;elves, if our Ve&s;&s;el &s;hould fail us; for the Doctor, Carpenter and Boat were left with Captain <HI>Dampier.</HI> But tru&s;ting to Gods Providence, who had already deli|vered us out of &s;o many dangers, we pro|ceeded on our intended Voyage for <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>On the 2<HI>d</HI> of <HI>Febuary</HI> we had a calm mo&s;t part of the day and night; and this day we caught &s;everal Fi&s;h called <HI>Yellow|tails,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXVIII.</NOTE> which came &s;wimming about our Ve&s;&s;el. The&s;e Fi&s;h were about four Foot in length. He had twenty Fins on his Back; one middling one near the hinder|part of his Head, one large one near the middle of his Back, and eighteen &s;mall ones &s;tretching from the &s;aid large one to

Here we lay all night; and the next Morning, (being in our account <HI>Tue&s;day May</HI> the 28th; but according to the <HI>Dutch</HI> account, <HI>Wedne&s;day;</HI> we having lo&s;t about eighteen Hours by our going to the We&s;tward, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> having got &s;ix Hours by coming to the Ea&s;tward; which makes the difference of time to be 24 hours,) two <HI>Dutch</HI> Orambyes, with 40 Paddles each, came on board of us. They brought the Fi&s;cal Secretary and &s;everal <HI>Dutch</HI> Gentle|men, and about thirty Soldiers, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Bark. They al&s;o went down and &s;ealed up all our Che&s;ts; and the two Orambyes went a-head to tow us in; and by noon we got up as high as the Town, where they moored our Ve&s;&s;el in the common anchoring-place.

<P>Although the <HI>Malayans</HI> are the mo&s;t nu|merous, yet the <HI>Dutch</HI> are po&s;&s;e&s;t of all the Sea-Coa&s;t; and have here a &s;trong Ca&s;tle built of Stone, and mounted with &s;ixty Guns; be&s;ides &s;everal other &s;mall Fortifications in other parts of the I&s;land.

At Sun-ri&s;ing every Morning they are let out of the Pri&s;on, in which they are kept, the Men in one, and the Women in another; and are immediately &s;ent to work; where they continue till twelve at Noon; at which time they return back, and have an Hours time to dine: Their Dinner is always the &s;ame, being nothing but a Pint of cour&s;e Rice boiled for each Man. At One they are &s;ent to work again; where they con|tinue till &s;ix in the Evening; at which time they return again, and go to Supper, which is always the &s;ame both in quanti|ty and quality, as at dinner. Soon after they have &s;upp'd, they are put into their Lodgings, and lock'd in; where they lie upon the bare Boards; and have &s;eldom any thing but a large piece of Wood, which commonly &s;erves five or &s;ix of them for a Pillow. Sometimes the&s;e poor Wretches make &s;hift to e&s;cape; but if they are caught again, they are &s;ure to be &s;e|verely handled. There was One of the&s;e poor Slaves, a Woman, who had been &s;e|verely u&s;ed by the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and having once made her e&s;cape, and being taken again; &s;he, knowing how &s;everely &s;he &s;hould be u&s;ed, cut her own Throat, the Day before her appointed Puni&s;hment: After which &s;he was by the Hair dragged out of the Pri&s;on all round the Town

<P>Such as are in Debt, and cannot &s;atisfie their Creditors, the Creditors turn over to the Company; who &s;end them to work among&s;t their Slaves. They have nothing allowed them, but Rice and Water, as the other Slaves; only they have two-pence a Day given them towards the Payment of their Debts; which avails but little: So that it is very &s;eldom, if ever, that a|ny one gets out, till he is carried out dead.</P>
<P>But though the poor Natives are thus &s;everely handled; yet the <HI>Dutch</HI> them|&s;elves will wink at one anothers Faults; &s;o that it is a great Rarity for any one of them to be puni&s;hed, unle&s;s it be for Mur|ther. Otherwi&s;e a &s;mall matter of Mo|ney will buy off a great Fault.</P>
<P>The Women that are Slaves to the Free-men, have all the liberty that may be, from their Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; only they are obliged every Night to bring them a certain Acknowledgement, which is commonly about &s;ix-pence a Day; and to find their own Victuals, Cloths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In default of which, they are &s;everely u&s;ed.

<P>The chief of what this I&s;land produces, is Cloves, Ginger, Pepper, Rattans, Cams, and &s;ome few Nut-megs.</P>
<P>The Clove-Tree is not very great of Body, but rather &s;lender. It is in length from twelve to thirty or forty foot. The Branches are &s;mall; the Leaves about five Inches long, and two broad; and end tapering. One of the&s;e Leaves rubb'd be|tween the Fingers, will &s;mell very &s;trong of Cloves; but without rubbing they have no &s;mell at all. The Cloves grow ju&s;t at the tip of the Branches; ten, twelve or fourteen in a Clu&s;ter. They are fir&s;t white, then green, then of a dark Copper-colour; which is the time of their being ripe. The manner of gathering them, is to &s;pread Cloths or Sheets round the bottom of the Tree, for a good di&s;tance. Then they &s;hake the Tree; and all the Cloves that are throughly ripe and fit to be ga|thered, fall down. The re&s;t which are left upon the Tree, they let hang for about &s;ix or &s;even Days. Then they &s;hake as many more of them off, as are ripe and will fall. This they do three, four, or five times; till they are all down. The u&s;ual time of gathering of them, is in <HI>Octo|ber</HI> and <HI>February.</HI> Tho&s;e which are ripe in <HI>October,</HI> are called the Winter Clove;
<PB N="261" REF="308">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> this being the end of their Winter; and they are not accounted &s;o good or &s;trong as the other. The&s;e they commonly pre&s;erve and put up in &s;mall Jarrs, of about a quart; of which they tran&s;port great quan|tities to &s;everal parts of the World. Tho&s;e which are ripe in <HI>February,</HI> are called the Summer-Clove: The&s;e are accounted much better and &s;tronger than the former; be|cau&s;e the&s;e have the be&s;t part of the Sum|mer to ripen in; whereas the former have not above a Months fair Weather, and all the re&s;t is rainy and cloudy, &s;o that the Rays of the Sun cannot come to them. It is the common receiv'd Opinion, that Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace and Cinamon, grow all upon one Tree; but it is a great mi&s;take. The&s;e Trees commonly bear &s;ixty, &s;eventy, or eighty pound weight at a time; and every &s;ix Years they are &s;ure to have a double Crop. There is a va&s;t number of the&s;e Trees upon this I&s;land; which are very carefully looked after, and a Regi&s;ter kept of them in the Company's Book. They are numbred once every Year; and beyond a certain number they will not let them encrea&s;e, but cut them down and de&s;troy them for fear of le&s;&s;en|ning the Price. All the&s;e Trees belong to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Company, or to their Freemen: But tho&s;e that belong to the Free-men, the Company &s;ets them an allowance as to
<PB N="262" REF="309">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> their number: And if any one rears up more than what the Company allows of, he is &s;everely fined, and his Trees forfeited. And what&s;oever Cloves, the Trees belonging to Free-men produce, the Freemen are obli|ged to &s;ell to the Company, after the rate of 6 <HI>d.</HI> a pound. So that properly all the Cloves upon the I&s;land are ingro&s;&s;ed into the Companies Hands; And if any Free|man or other &s;ells or conveys away to the value of ten pounds; all that he has in the World is forfeited to the Company, and he to be made a Slave during Life. The Inhabitants u&s;ed formerly to put Cheats upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the Sale of their Cloves; for it was common with them to put their Cloves in a large Sheet, which they hung up by its four Corners under the Cieling of their Hou&s;e; and upon the Floor, right under the Cloves, they would &s;et a large Tub of fre&s;h Water; which the Cloves, being very dry and of a hot Nature, would by degrees draw up, and make a large addition to their weight, without being ea&s;ily perceived: But now the <HI>Dutch</HI> are grown too cunning for them; For they always try them by giving them a &s;mall fillip with their Fore-finger on the Head; and then, if the Clove be throughly ripe, and no Deceit has been u&s;ed, the Head will break all in pieces like a piece of thin brittle Gla&s;s: But if it has been wetted,
<PB N="263" REF="310">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> then the Clove will be very tough; and the whole Clove will &s;ooner bend, than the Head fly off.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome few Nut-megs upon this I&s;land; the Trees of which are much like the Peach. But they grow mo&s;tly at the I&s;land <HI>Banda:</HI> From whence two or three Ship-loads are exported every Year. The Fruit of this Tree con&s;i&s;ts of four Parts; the fir&s;t and outward Rind, is like that of a green Wal-nut; the &s;econd is dry and thin, which we call Mace; the third is a tough thin Shell, like that of a Che&s;nut; and the fourth is the Kernel included in the &s;aid Shell, which we call Nut-meg.</P>
<P>There are &s;aid to be upon this I&s;land &s;ome Mines of Gold. One of the <HI>Malayans</HI> &s;howed me &s;ome of the Ore, which he &s;aid was taken out of them: But this he &s;aid was a great Crime; and if the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hould know it, he &s;hould be &s;evere|ly puni&s;hed: For this is an extraordinary Secret, which, as much as they can, they keep from all <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P>Although, as I &s;aid before, they can rai&s;e about five hundred and fifty fighting Men upon this I&s;land; yet once every Year they are forced to &s;pare a great many of their People, which are &s;ent away up|on other Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es. For commonly on the 20th of <HI>October</HI> each Year, eight or ten Days &s;ooner or later, the Governour
<PB N="264" REF="311">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> of this place goes his Progre&s;s, attended with about &s;eventy five Orambies, &s;ome with a hundred, &s;ome eighty, &s;ome fifty, and &s;ome forty Paddles a-piece: In each of which go two <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldiers. I reckon there may be in this whole Fleet, of <HI>Dutch</HI> about 150 or 160, and about 5250 <HI>Ma|layans,</HI> reckoning &s;eventy <HI>Malayans</HI> to each Oramby, one with another. The&s;e &s;eventy-five Orambies are divided into three Squadrons: The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ting of twenty Orambies; which Squadron is always commanded by one of the Council, who carries a yellow Flag: The Rear con&s;i&s;ts of twenty more, and is commanded by the Fi&s;call, who commonly carries a red Flag: The re&s;t are in the middle Squadron, and attend the Governour, who hath twelve <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldiers, a Corporal and a Serjeant for his Body-guard, and carries a blew Flag. The Governour carries with him the <HI>Indian</HI> King, and all their Princes, for fear they &s;hould rebel in his Ab&s;ence. In this Order they go and vi&s;it all the&s;e Ea|&s;tern I&s;lands, but e&s;pecially tho&s;e that do or would produce Cloves or Nut-megs. And at every I&s;land they go to, they have an additional &s;trength. The time of their cruizing in this manner, is commonly &s;ix Weeks; in which time they cut down, burn and de&s;troy all the Clove and Nut|meg Trees they can find, excepting &s;uch as
<PB N="265" REF="312">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> are re&s;erved for the Companies u&s;e. For all or mo&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands do or would produce Cloves; But they will not &s;uffer them, becau&s;e they have enough to &s;upply all <HI>Europe</HI> at <HI>Amboyna</HI> alone; and even there al&s;o, as I &s;aid before, they will per|mit but a certain number, lea&s;t a Plenty of them &s;hould lower the price. Upon all the&s;e I&s;lands the <HI>Dutch</HI> Company keeps Soldiers, three, &s;ix, nine or twelve, ac|cording as they are in bigne&s;s; Who&s;e on|ly bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;ee the Trees cut down, or at lea&s;t to take care they do not en|crea&s;e: For they are very jealous lea&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French</HI> &s;hould &s;erve them &s;uch a Trick, as they them&s;elves formerly &s;erved the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Amboyna.</HI> During the time of their thus cruizing, they gather Tribute from all the petty Kings and Princes of the&s;e I&s;lands; and commonly at the end of about &s;ix Weeks, return again.</P>
<P>Of Bea&s;ts here are &s;everal &s;orts, as Beeves, Hogs, wild Deer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of Fowls here are al&s;o &s;everal &s;orts, as the <HI>Crocka|dore,</HI> the <HI>Ca&s;&s;awaris,</HI> the <HI>Bird of Para|dice, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Crockadore</HI> is a Bird of various &s;i|zes; &s;ome being as big as a Hen, and others no bigger than a Pidgeon. They are in all parts exactly of the &s;hape of a Parrot. Their Feathers are all over white, excepting only a Bunch upon their Head,
<PB N="266" REF="313">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> which is always either yellow or red. This Bunch of Feathers lies &s;o clo&s;e fitted into a dent in the Head, that they can|not be perceived, unle&s;s when the Bird is frighted; and then he &s;ets it up an end, and it &s;preads open like a Fan. The Fle&s;h and Legs of this Bird are quite black; and they &s;mell very &s;weet. When thy fly wild up and down the Woods, they will call <HI>Crockadore, Crockadore;</HI> for which rea&s;on they go by that name.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ca&s;&s;awaris</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXXVI.</NOTE> is about the bigne&s;s of a large <HI>Virginia</HI> Turkey. His Head is the &s;ame as a Turkeys; and he has a long &s;tiff hairy Beard upon his Brea&s;t before, like a Turkey. He hath two great Legs, almo&s;t as thick as a Man's Wri&s;t; with five great Claws upon each Foot: He has a high round Back; and in&s;tead of Feathers only long Hairs; and the &s;ame upon the Pini|ons of his Wings. It lays an Egg &s;o big that it will hold a Pint. The Shell is pret|ty thick, &s;potted with green and white, and looks exactly like China-ware. I ne|ver ta&s;ted the Eggs, but the Bird it &s;elf is extraordinary good Victuals, as I have tried &s;everal times. It ta&s;tes very like a Turkey, but much &s;tronger.</P>

It is related of the&s;e Birds, that when the Nutmegs are ripe, which is in the Months of <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March,</HI> they re&s;ort to the Places where they grow, <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>Banda</HI> and this place, and eat off the outer-rind of the Nut: After which they fall down dead drunk, and an innumerable Company of Ants gather about them and feed upon them, and kill them.</P>

<P>Of Fruits here are Plantains, Bonanoes, Pine-Apples, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Pine-Apple grows upon a low &s;hrub, with prickly Leaves. They are &s;o big, that they will commonly weigh two pound, and two pound and a half. When it is ripe, it is yellow and red without, and full of little Bunches; within it is yellow, and &s;o juicy, that when you bite it, the Juice will run down your Chin and Clothes; and the Li|quor
<PB N="268" REF="316">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> is very cool and plea&s;ant. Before they eat it, they commonly rub it well with Salt, and &s;o let it lye for about an Hour, which takes away the rawne&s;s of it; then they wa&s;h it in fre&s;h Water, and eat it. But One is &s;ufficient for two or three People: For they are very apt to cau&s;e Feavers.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o another &s;ort of Fruit, called a <HI>Mangoe.</HI> It is about the bigne&s;s of our common Cucumber. The out-&s;ide, altho' ripe, looks green; and within, it is very yellow. It is a very delicious Fruit, when ripe; and has a fine fragrant &s;mell. When they are green, they cut them in two pieces, which they pickle and &s;end to mo&s;t parts of the World.

<P>This I&s;land of <HI>Amboyna</HI> is &s;andy all round; but the Water is &s;o deep, that there is no anchoring near it, but at the <HI>Ley,</HI> (which is at the We&s;t-end of the I&s;land,) in forty fathom Water clo&s;e to the &s;hore; and in the common Harbour.

<P>Whil&s;t we were at this I&s;land of <HI>Amboy|na,</HI> we were &s;o much troubled with Mos|kitoes, (which are a &s;ort of Gnats,) that every Night we were forced to put our &s;elves in a Bag, before we could go to &s;leep; for otherwi&s;e the&s;e Creatures would &s;o bite us, that there was no &s;leep|ing: And whereever they bite, they com|monly rai&s;ed a red Bli&s;ter, almo&s;t as broad as a Silver-penny: This would itch very much, and many could not forbear &s;crat|ching them&s;elves &s;o, as to cau&s;e Inflamma|tions, which &s;ometimes are the cau&s;e of the lo&s;s of a Limb.</P>

<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> During our &s;tay here, we had the liberty of a broad paved Yard, about &s;ixty Yards &s;quare; but by no means would they let us go out into the Town; being very jea|lous of us, and de&s;irous to prevent (as much as they could) our knowing their Strength, or making any other Di&s;coveries which they thought might be prejudicial to them.</P>
<P>Here we remained from the 31&s;t of <HI>May</HI> to the 14th of <HI>September</HI> 1705. At which time there being three of the Companies Sloops ready to &s;ail hence, laden with Cloves; twenty five of our Men were &s;ent away with them for <HI>Batavia;</HI> and we were ten of us left behind, who were (as they &s;aid) to go in another Ve&s;&s;el, which was almo&s;t ready to &s;ail.</P>
<P>It was very ob&s;ervable, that all the time of our being here, none of us fell &s;ick or died. For this was the S.

<P>The Rea&s;on why I have given &s;o little account of the Winds and Sea&s;ons of the Year in this whole Voyage, is becau&s;e the&s;e things are &s;o well de&s;cribed in Capt. <HI>Dampier</HI>'s 2d Volume; But he not having &s;poken much of the&s;e <HI>Moluccoes</HI> or Spice-I&s;lands, I have therefore endeavoured to give the more particular Account of them.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FROM <HI>Amboyna</HI> we &s;teered away S. W. by W. till we came to the I&s;land <HI>Lancas;</HI> and in our way pa&s;&s;ed by the I&s;land <HI>Amblow,</HI> of which I have already &s;poken. The I&s;land <HI>Lancas</HI> is a &s;hort low I&s;land, on which is &s;tore of Wood. It is not inhabited; and all round it, for a good di&s;tance, is &s;aid to be &s;hole Water. It lies in the Latitude of 5 d. 27 m. South; and I made Meridian di&s;tance ftom <HI>Amboy|na</HI> 155 Miles, or 2 d. 35. m. We&s;t.</P>
<P>From hence we &s;teered W. by N. for a &s;mall time, till we came up with the two I&s;lands <HI>Cabe&s;es.</HI> Where it falling calm, we &s;ent our Boat a&s;hore to the Ea&s;termo&s;t of them, and cut down &s;ome Hundreds of Coco-nuts, which we carried on board. This was al&s;o a low I&s;land, not inhabited, but all round full of Coco-nut-trees, which are planted here on purpo&s;e for the u&s;e
<PB N="277" REF="325">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> of &s;uch <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships and Ve&s;&s;els as pa&s;s by here for <HI>Batavia.</HI> For it is a great Rarity to &s;ee any <HI>European</HI> &s;hipping here, be&s;ides the <HI>Dutch.</HI> Off this I&s;land we met our Bark, which had brought us from <HI>America</HI> to <HI>Amboyna.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> after they had taken her from us, fitted her up, put a Mizen-Ma&s;t in, and made a very good Ve&s;|&s;el of her. This I&s;land lies in the Latitude of 5 d. 23 m. South; and nearly W. by N. from the I&s;land <HI>Lancas,</HI> di&s;tance about 45 Miles: It is &s;hole two Miles from the Shore. To the S. W. of this, is the other I&s;land of <HI>Cabe&s;es,</HI> which is a pretty high I&s;land, and upon it the <HI>Dutch</HI> always keep &s;ix Sol|diers and a Corporal, who two or three times a Year go round the I&s;land to &s;ee that no Cloves be planted; and if there be, they cut them down and burn them, for fear lea&s;t any other Nation &s;hould take it from them; which if they &s;hould, I am apt to believe <HI>Amboyna</HI> would be of little u&s;e to them; Cloves being the only Pro|duct valuable upon it.</P>
<P>From hence we pa&s;&s;ed by the South-part of the I&s;land <HI>Bouton,</HI> which lies in the La|titude of 5 d. 45 m. South. It is a pretty large I&s;land, taking up above a degree and half in Latitude.</P>
<P>From hence we &s;teered to the We&s;t|ward, and pa&s;&s;ed between the I&s;land <HI>Ce|lebes</HI> and the I&s;land <HI>Zalayer.</HI> The South-part
<PB N="278" REF="326">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> of the I&s;land <HI>Celebes,</HI> is very high Land. It is very well inhabited, and is a very large I&s;land, taking up &s;even de|grees in Latitude. At the South-end of this I&s;land, on the We&s;t-&s;ide, the <HI>Dutch</HI> have a Factory, called <HI>Maca&s;&s;er,</HI> where they have a Fort of about &s;eventy Guns, mann'd with &s;ix or &s;even hundred <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldiers. The chief Product of the Place, is Rice; with which they &s;upply all or mo&s;t of their Ea&s;tern I&s;lands. Here are al&s;o &s;aid to be &s;everal Gold-mines, of which the <HI>Dutch</HI> are not yet ma&s;ters. For the Inha|bitants are often at War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and pretty well defend tho&s;e Places.</P>
<P>Between the South-end of the I&s;land <HI>Celebes,</HI> and the I&s;land <HI>Zalayer,</HI> are three &s;mall low I&s;lands; and the be&s;t Pa&s;&s;age, is between that which lies next to the I&s;land <HI>Zalayer,</HI> and a little &s;mall one which lies to the Northward of That. This is called the &s;econd Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Zalayer,</HI> and is accounted the be&s;t; For in the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Zalayer,</HI> are many &s;holes, but in this &s;econd it is deep Water: The third and fourth are al&s;o deep; but if you go through with the Sea-wind, you will be &s;o nigh the &s;hore of <HI>Celebes,</HI> that you mu&s;t be forced to anchor till the Land-wind comes: Wherefore the &s;econd is al|ways accounted the be&s;t Pa&s;&s;age; and mo&s;t Ships, rather than go through the fir&s;t,
<PB N="279" REF="327">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> third or fourth, will lie a whole Day to go through the &s;econd; which they do as commonly in the Night, as in the Day, there being no danger.</P>
<P>The I&s;land <HI>Zalayer</HI> is of a moderate height. It is inhabited by <HI>Malayans,</HI> and planted all round with Coco-nut-trees. The Inhabitants are forced yearly to &s;end &s;tore of Oil and Match to the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Maca&s;&s;er,</HI> as a Tribute.</P>
<P>From hence we &s;teered W. by N. (ha|ving had the Wind in the Ea&s;tern Quar|ter ever &s;ince we left <HI>Amboyna,</HI>) till we had pa&s;&s;ed a dangerous &s;hole called the <HI>Brill;</HI> and then we haul'd up S. W. and in the Night &s;aw a &s;mall I&s;land ju&s;t by us; which finding we could not weather, we tack'd and &s;tood the other way till Day-light; and then finding our &s;elves to the Southward of the &s;aid I&s;land, we tackt and &s;tood to the South-we&s;tward; and &s;oon after &s;aw two other &s;mall low I&s;lands, bearing from the North to the North-we&s;t. We could &s;ee the Ground very plain for about two Miles; and never had above &s;ix, or under five fathom Water, though it looked as if there was not above two fathom. We came over this &s;hole about a league to the Southward of the &s;aid two &s;mall I&s;lands; and this is accounted the narrowe&s;t part of the Shole; for further to the Southward it is five or &s;ix Leagues
<PB N="280" REF="328">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> over: But There al&s;o there is no danger, becau&s;e you have very even Soundings, as five or &s;ix fathom, &s;eldom over or un|der. But to the Northward of the&s;e two I&s;lands, it is very dangerous; it being all very foul rocky Ground, and in &s;ome places not above four or five foot Water. Therefore be &s;ure to go to the Southward of the&s;e I&s;lands, and you will be &s;afe: Al|though the <HI>Dutch</HI> in mo&s;t of their Maps, (unle&s;s in &s;uch as they give to their own People,) have laid down the Dangers to the Southward, which &s;hould have been laid down to the Northward of the two I&s;lands: And the &s;afe &s;holes, which we and they always go over, they have laid down to the Northward of the two I&s;lands; whereas we and they al&s;o went over to the Southward of them. We had a Draught on board belonging to the Cap|tain of the Ve&s;&s;el, which &s;howed all this very exactly as we found it. I compared it with &s;everal others which were on board, and found a great deal of Diffe|rence. I asked the Captain the rea&s;on of their Difference; and he told me that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> knew all the &s;holes and dangerous places hereabouts very well; but did not de&s;ire that any Body el&s;e &s;hould know them. So that if any Fo|reigner &s;hould come into the&s;e Parts a|mong&s;t the&s;e &s;holes, and &s;ail by their
<PB N="281" REF="329">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> Draughts; they, thinking all &s;afe, might unexpectedly be among&s;t Rocks and Sholes, where they would certainly lo&s;e their Ship; as we had done, if we had &s;ailed by the common Draughts. It being the <HI>Dutch</HI> Policy, to keep all Ships belonging to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> as far off the&s;e Ea&s;tern I&s;lands, as they can; or at lea&s;t if any do chance to come among&s;t them, and happen into their Hands, as we did; to take care to &s;end them away from a|mong them, and to let them know as lit|tle of them as may be.</P>
<P>On the 16th of <HI>October</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory, called <HI>Rambang;</HI> and on the 21&s;t, arrived in the Harbour of <HI>Bata|via.</HI> Here we were &s;ent a&s;hore to the Bomb-Key, to the re&s;t of our Men, who had been &s;ent hither before, and were not yet cleared. And &s;oon after, the Major of the Ca&s;tle was &s;ent to us, and de&s;ired we would &s;end to the General by him an Account of our Lo&s;&s;es and Damages, which we received by our being taken at <HI>Amboyna;</HI> and that we &s;hould be &s;atisfied upon all Accounts, both as to our lo&s;t Things, lo&s;s of Time, and Impri&s;onment. Accordingly we each of us drew up an account of our Lo&s;&s;es, and &s;ent it by the Major to the General, who return'd us an&s;wer, that very &s;peedily we &s;hould have Satisfaction and our Freedom. On the
<PB N="282" REF="330">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> 27th of <HI>October</HI> we were all &s;ent for to the Fort, and mo&s;t of our ready Money was return'd to us again; but for our Goods, lo&s;s of Time, and Impri&s;onment, we could have no Satisfaction. Only the General told us he had given us all that the Gover|nour of <HI>Amboyna</HI> had &s;ent to him; and that if there was any thing more, he knew nothing of it; and that we were now at our liberty to go where we plea&s;ed. We de&s;ired, that &s;ince our Ve&s;&s;el was taken from us by the Company, (of which He was the Head,) he would be plea&s;ed to take care to find us &s;ome Ship in which we might return home; which he promi|&s;ed he would. We were forced to be con|tent; and went and took Lodgings in the Town, till we could meet with an oppor|tunity of returning home.</P>
<P>And now being at a &s;top here for a while, I &s;hall give &s;ome De&s;cription of this North Coa&s;t of <HI>Java.</HI> The I&s;land is in length Ea&s;t and We&s;t about ten De|grees.

The Anchor-ground all along the North &s;ide of <HI>Java,</HI> from the I&s;land <HI>Madura</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> is brave oazey Ground, and clear of Rocks. The principal places on this &s;ide of the I|&s;land, are <HI>Batavia, Bantam, Japara, Sa|marang, Surabon, Taggall,</HI> the <HI>Quale</HI> and <HI>Rambang.</HI> All the&s;e places are &s;ettled by the <HI>Dutch.</HI> They afford Rice, with which they &s;upply all their Out-factories herea|bouts; as al&s;o very good Plank, to build Shipping with. The chief place of build|ing is <HI>Rambang;</HI> where the Freemen go to build their &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, as Sloops and Brigantines. Al&s;o &s;everal Ships of five, &s;ix, or &s;even hundred Tuns, lade with Timber at <HI>Rambang,</HI> the <HI>Quale, Japa|ra,</HI> &amp;c.

There are commonly fix of the&s;e
<PB N="284" REF="332">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> Ships, which thus lade with Timber; and they commonly make four Voyages in the good Mon&s;oon: For in the bad, they can|not do any thing. All this Timber is com|monly landed upon a &s;mall I&s;land between four and five leagues from <HI>Batavia;</HI> where the Ship-Carpenters are u&s;ually kept at work; nay, they are &s;aid to be never out of Employ. They are about two hundred in number; and the I&s;land is called <HI>&V;n|re&s;t;</HI> a very fit name for it; for here is &s;aid to be no re&s;t for an idle per&s;on. The <HI>Dutch</HI> careen all their Ships here; and it is very well fortified, being all round a Bed of Guns.</P>
<P><HI>Batavia</HI> is the chief place the <HI>Dutch</HI> have in <HI>India;</HI> receiving by Shipping, the Product of <HI>India, Japan,</HI> and <HI>China.</HI> It is inhabited by &s;everal &s;orts of people; as <HI>Dutch, Portugue&s;e, Chine&s;e, Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Negroes;</HI> but the <HI>Malayans</HI> are the Na|tives.

<P>But this place is &s;o well known to mo&s;t Europeans, that it needs no further De&s;cription.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd of <HI>December,</HI> all of us which had a de&s;ire to return to <HI>England,</HI> were ordered on board the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-In|dia</HI> Fleet; And the next Day the whole Fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of about twelve Sail, weigh'd anchor and left <HI>Batavia.</HI> On the 8th we arrived at <HI>Bantam;</HI> where we wooded, water'd, and refre&s;h'd our &s;elves; and took in &s;tore of Provi&s;ions, as Beeves, Hogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for our &s;upply during our Pa&s;|&s;age to the Cape. This is al&s;o a <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory; and the chief Trading is for Pepper. On the 11th we weigh'd from <HI>Bantam.</HI> The We&s;terly Mon&s;oon was &s;et in pretty hard again&s;t us; But however, having a &s;trong Current &s;etting to the Wind-ward, we made &s;hift to turn again&s;t the Mon&s;oon: Yet it commonly blowing very hard at Night, whil&s;t we were in the Streights of <HI>Sunda,</HI> we u&s;ed to run in un|der the <HI>Java</HI> &s;hore, and there anchor till the next Morning. All through the&s;e Streights the Coa&s;t is good and bold; and though there be many Sholes, yet the Soundings are good even in the mo&s;t dan|gerous place, which is between <HI>Bantam</HI> and <HI>Batavia:</HI> But no Man will venture to

<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> &s;ail by Night, although it &s;holeth gradually near any Bank, and the Anchor-ground is very good, that Ships can &s;top when they plea&s;e if they are plying to Windward.</P>
<P>On the 13th we came up with a &s;mall high I&s;land, called <HI>Princes I&s;land.</HI> It lies at the We&s;t-end of this Streight of <HI>Sunda;</HI> And from hence we took our departure for the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI> We had no|thing material happen'd to us, in this our Pa&s;&s;age: And we arrived at the Cape on the 3d of <HI>February</HI> 1705/6; having been ju&s;t two Months in our pa&s;&s;age: And here we found four Ships belonging to our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> is the Southermo&s;t part of <HI>Africa,</HI> &s;ituated four Degrees and a half within the Southern Temperate Zone. Near it, is the Table Bay; a ve|ry healthy place, and producing all Ne|ce&s;&s;aries for the Life of Man. The <HI>Dutch</HI> are Ma&s;ters of this place, and have here a Fort of about fifty Guns, which they were now about moting round. Half a mile to the We&s;tward of the &s;aid Fort, they have belonging to them a pretty Town, con|&s;i&s;ting of about a hundred and fifty <HI>Dutch</HI> Hou&s;es, and a &s;mall Church, &s;ituated un|der a very high Mountain, called the <HI>Ta|ble-Land.</HI> The Town and Fort are under a Governour and a Fi&s;cal, (who, as I have &s;aid before, is in the nature of a Judge.)</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="337">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> The Natives of this Place, are a tawny &s;warthy &s;ort of People, who call them|&s;elves <HI>Hodmandods;</HI> and are certainly the next to Bea&s;ts, of any People on the face of the Earth. Both Men and Women are of a middle Stature, with &s;mall No&s;es, little Mouths and Eyes, and an oval Face. They have a woolly Head of Hair, like the <HI>Guinea</HI> or <HI>Angola-Negroes.</HI> Both Men and Women cover them&s;elves with only two raw Sheeps Hides, ju&s;t as they come from the Sheeps Back. In the Day they wear them like a Mantle, over their Shoul|ders; and in the Night when they &s;leep, one of them &s;erves to lie under them in|&s;tead of a Bed, the other to cover them. And thus like Bea&s;ts they lie, Men, Wo|men, and Children, the whole Family to|gether. They &s;mear or grea&s;e them&s;elves very much; which makes them &s;tink a|bominably; And the thicker they are with Grea&s;e, the more they are admired by one another. The Women to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the Men, wear dried Thongs of the Sheeps Skins, rouled round their Legs from the Ankle to the Knee; which makes their Legs &s;eem as big as Po&s;ts; and they look'd like a Rowl of Tobacco. They al&s;o wear a long Cap (made of the &s;ame) which goes up tape|ring like a Piramid. But their clothing is the &s;ame as the Mens, <HI>viz.</HI> two raw Sheeps
<PB N="290" REF="338">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> Skins. They are a very &s;hamele&s;s igno|rant People, and as far as I could perceive, without any Laws or Government of their own; only each Family is &s;ubject to the elde&s;t of their Family. Both Men and Women are great Lovers of Tobacco; and for two or three ounces of it, a Man will not &s;tick to pro&s;titute his Wife to any <HI>European</HI> what&s;oever. The Men are not at all jealous, and care not how many <HI>Europeans</HI> lye with their Wives; yet they will beat their Wives &s;everely, if they know them to lye with any of their own Nation be&s;ides them&s;elves. They are a People that will eat any &s;oul or na&s;ty thing. For if the <HI>Dutch</HI> kill a Beeve or a Sheep, they will beg the Guts, out of which they &s;queeze the Dung; and with|out wa&s;hing or any cleaning at all, cut them into &s;mall peices, and lay them upon the fire; and a&s;&s;oon as they are hot through, take them off and eat them.</P>
<P>Their Children, when they are young, are &s;omething inclining to be White; and were it not for their na&s;ty way of greazing them, they would make likely Men and Women: For they are mo&s;t of them very well featured. The <HI>Dutch</HI> did formerly what they could, to bring them to the knowledge of the true God, and to leave their na&s;ty way of living:
<PB N="291" REF="339">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> but never could prevail with them; they &s;till de&s;iring rather to live like Bea&s;ts; Wor&s;hip they &s;eem to have none; ex|cept at the full Moons; and then they Dance and Sing all or mo&s;t of the Night; and the brighter the Moon is, the more is their Mirth; For then they think the Moon, which &s;eems to be their God, is well-plea&s;ed with them: But if the Moon chance to be ob&s;cured with Clouds, then they &s;eem much dejected, and fancy their God is angry with them.</P>
<P>I was told a &s;tory by the Per&s;on with whom I lodged here, that &s;ome years &s;ince, the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ent two of the&s;e <HI>Hod|mandod</HI> Men to <HI>Holland;</HI> where they were very well cloathed, had a good maintenance allowed them, and for the &s;pace of four years were &s;ent up and down to &s;ee the &s;everal parts of <HI>Hol|land</HI> and other Countries adjacent: The <HI>Dutch</HI> thinking this would be a means of bringing them to a more civilized way of living. But it proved ineffe|ctual: For the two <HI>Hodmandods</HI> at their return, as &s;oon as they got a&s;hore, tore off all their Cloaths, and returned to their old bea&s;tly way of living.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="340">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> The&s;e people have low Matt Hou&s;es, in form of a Bee-hive; The Door not above three foot high; and the highe&s;t part of the Hou&s;e about &s;ix foot high: In the middle of which, in cold weather, they make a Fire; and the whole Family, Men, Women and Children, and their Dogs, all lie round it; where they &s;leep as &s;ound, as other people do in their Beds of Down. Yet the&s;e people are as healthy, and as free from Pains and Aches, as any on the whole Continent of <HI>Africa.</HI> Their Hou&s;hold-goods are &s;eldom any thing more than two earthen Pots; one broken, the other whole; The broken Pot &s;erves them in&s;tead of a Frying-pan, and the o|ther to boil their Victuals in.</P>
<P>They are no way ingenious, neither do they follow any Trades. The mo&s;t of their delight is in looking after Flocks of Sheep; and in this the <HI>Dutch</HI> often em|ploy them. If one of them does half an hours work for a <HI>Dutchman</HI> or any <HI>Euro|pean,</HI> he will demand a Doublekey; which is a piece of Money that goes for Two-pence; And if there be occa&s;ion to work him from morning till night, he will demand no more.</P>
<P>The Land hereabouts is very mountain|ous, and the Mountains are mo&s;t of them very barren, producing only a few &s;mall &s;hrubby Bu&s;hes. And within the Coun|try
<PB N="293" REF="341">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> are abundance of Lions, Tygers, wild Elephants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e wild Bea&s;ts the <HI>Dutch</HI> kill after this manner: They make a pret|ty large Circle, upon the edge of which they fix five, &s;ix, &s;even, or eight Po&s;ts, about eighteen or twenty foot from each other: Upon each of the&s;e Po&s;ts is a Mu&s;|ket made fa&s;t, the Muzles of which are all placed &s;o as to point to the Center of the Circle: The Muskets are well loaded; and from the Trigger of each Musket is a &s;mall Line, reaching to the Center of the &s;aid Circle, and there fa&s;tned to a piece of raw Fle&s;h; which when a wild Bea&s;t &s;eizes upon, mo&s;t or all of the Muskets go off, and &s;eldom fail to kill him. Any one that kills a Lion, is paid by the Publick fifty-two Guilders, which amounts to four Pound &s;ix Shillings and eight Pence; And for killing a Tyger he has a Reward of twenty-four Guilders or forty Shillings. There was a <HI>Scotchman</HI> whil&s;t we were here, who killed four Lions, three Ty|gers, and three wild Elephants; for which he had his Reward, according to the afore&s;aid Proportion.</P>
<P>This place produces &s;everal &s;orts of Fruits, both common and not common to us in <HI>Europe;</HI> as Pomgranates, Water-me|lons, Che&s;nuts, with &s;ome few Plantains and Bonanoes, and &s;tore of very good Grapes, of which the <HI>Dutch</HI> make a very
<PB N="294" REF="342">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> pretty and plea&s;ant Wine in great quanti|ties, which by Retale is commonly &s;old at eight Pence a Quart. It al&s;o produces abundance of Garden-Fruit, which is ve|ry refre&s;hing to tho&s;e that arrive here &s;ick of the Scurvy.</P>
<P>Of Bea&s;ts here are great &s;tore; <HI>to wit,</HI> Lions, Tygers, Elephants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which all run wild up and down the Country; but near the Towns they are &s;eldom &s;een: Here are al&s;o abundance of Sheep, ve|ry large, and I think as good Meat as ever I eat.</P>
<P>Of Fowls here are al&s;o &s;everal &s;orts; But the mo&s;t noted, as I think, is the O&s;tridge; which is a very large Fowl. The Bird it &s;elf is little valuable, but for its Feathers, which are &s;ent as Rarities to &s;eve|ral parts of the World. Their Eggs are very good Meat, as I have experienc'd many times. That the&s;e Birds do feed upon Iron, Stones, or any thing that chances to be near them, is fabulous; but, like a great ma|ny other Fowls, they peck up &s;mall Stones, which only &s;erve to dige&s;t their proper Food. They are of &s;everal colours, as black, white, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Sea Inhabitants, the mo&s;t noted is the Seal, or, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> call it, the <HI>Sea-Hound.</HI> They are the &s;ame as tho&s;e be|fore &s;poken of at the I&s;land <HI>Juan Fernan|does,</HI> only the Furr of the&s;e is not &s;o fine.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="343">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> In this Harbour, on the South &s;ide, are two great high noted Mountains; the one called the Table-Land, which is pretty plain and even at the top; and the other called the Sugar-loaf, from its &s;hape. At the top of this Sugar-loaf the <HI>Dutch</HI> have a &s;mall Hou&s;e, and four Guns mounted: Here they always keep a Look-out, and at the approach of any Ship or Ships, hoi&s;t a Flag, and fire as many Guns as they &s;ee Ships, to give notice to tho&s;e at the Town.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay here, there arrived &s;ome more <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> homeward bound Ships, both <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> al&s;o here we met with &s;ome of our Men that had left us in the Gulf of <HI>Nicoya,</HI> and went away with our Chief-mate.

Which being done, they &s;ent two of their Pri|&s;oners a&s;hore with a Letter to the Gover|nour, in which they demanded 10000 Dollars for the ran&s;ome of the other Prize. The Governour &s;ent them word, that the Owners of the &s;aid Ship were poor, and that the Town was al&s;o poor, &s;o that they could not give &s;o much;
<PB N="296" REF="344">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"> but if 4000 Dollars would &s;atisfie them, he would &s;end them aboard the next day, upon our Mens word, that upon the receipt of the Money they would de|liver up the &s;aid Prize. They an&s;wered, that they wanted Provi&s;ions and Water; and therefore whatever was found in the &s;aid Prize either Eatable or Drinkable, &s;hould not be comprehended in the Bar|gain. To this the Governour readily agreed, and &s;ent the Money. And a&s;&s;oon as the Provi&s;ions could be got out of her, &s;he was according to agreement delivered up. From thence our Men went to the Gulf of <HI>Salinas,</HI> and haul'd their Ve&s;&s;el a&s;hore, and clean'd and refitted her. And from thence, with all the ha&s;te they could, they proceeded on their Voyage for <HI>India;</HI> and in fifty four Days reached the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, having kept all the way in the Latitude of 18 d. North. Among&s;t the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands a Canoa came off to them with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t in her: Him they detained and &s;ent the Canoa a&s;hore for &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, as a ran&s;om for the &s;aid Prie&s;t; which accordingly was &s;ent to them, and they relea&s;ed the prie&s;t. From thence they went to the I&s;land <HI>Pulo Condore;</HI> but &s;inding the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> all cut off, they went for <HI>Mocoa</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> where after they had given an account from whence they came,

<P>On the 24th of <HI>March,</HI> we having re|fitted our Ships, and refre&s;hed our Men, and taken in &s;tore of fre&s;h Provi&s;ions; and there being a fre&s;h Gale of Wind at S.

This is a pretty low &s;andy I|&s;land. In the middle of which, upon the highe&s;t part of it, they have a few Guns mounted, and near them a Flag-&s;taff, on which at the approach of any Ship they hoi&s;t a Flag, and fire a Gun, to give no|tice to the Town. This I&s;land takes its name from a va&s;t number of Birds, called <HI>Penguins,</HI> which commonly re&s;ort near it. The&s;e Birds are about the bigne&s;s of a Wild Duck: They do not fly, but flutter, having no Wings, but only &s;tumps like young Ducks; and the&s;e &s;tumps are in|&s;tead of Fins to them when they are in the Water. They have a &s;harp Bill, but Feet like a Duck; and their Fle&s;h is but mean Victuals.</P>
<P>We were now twenty-four Sail of us, <HI>viz.</HI> nine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and fifteen <HI>Dutch;</HI> and the Gale continuing, &s;oon carried us into
<PB N="298" REF="346">
<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="year"> the true Trade. We met with nothing material till the 10th of <HI>April;</HI> <MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="year"> when two of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships &s;ailing very heavy, fell a &s;tern, and lo&s;t our Compa|ny. They put into St. <HI>Hellena;</HI> and, as we hear &s;ince, were taken out of the Road by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>On the 11th we had twenty five Hogs killed, for the Ships Company; and the Commodore ordered a Hog to a Me&s;s, that is, to every &s;even Men, to di&s;po&s;e of as we plea&s;ed, be&s;ides our daily Al|lowance; &s;o that we had more Victuals than we could tell what to do with.</P>
<P>On the 15th, a Man being barbarou&s;ly murthered on Board the <HI>Dutch</HI> Vice-Ad|miral, the Murtherer was brought on Board our Ship and tryed for his Life, and the &s;ame day condemned to dye. He owned he did the Murther, and de|&s;ired the favour of the Court that he might chu&s;e his Death; which was gran|ted; and he cho&s;e to be Shot, which the next day was accordingly done; all the Fleet lying by till his Death, and then we all made &s;ail again.</P>
<P>On the 17th we &s;aw the I&s;land of <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion;</HI> but did not touch here for Turtle, although it was their laying time; the rea&s;on was, becau&s;e we were &s;o well provided with Provi&s;ions at the Cape, that we had no occa&s;ion for more; and
<PB N="299" REF="347">
<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="year"> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships being willing to keep us Company, they al&s;o did not touch here.</P>
<P>On the 19th we had fine fair Weather, with a fre&s;h Gale at South Ea&s;t. About eleven this morning happened a great Earth-quake. At fir&s;t it &s;eemed as if the Ship run along upon the Ground: So we heaved out a Lead on each &s;ide with two hundred fathom of Line, but found no ground. The whole Fleet felt the Shock at the &s;ame time; &s;o that for half a quarter of an hour there was nothing but making of Signals and firing of Guns. We then reckoned the I&s;land of <HI>A&s;cen|&s;ion</HI> to bear South Ea&s;t, di&s;tant about forty Leagues.</P>
<P>Hence we &s;teered away to the North We&s;tward, and on the 14th of <HI>June</HI> &s;aw four Sail of <HI>French</HI> Privateers. They lay a while and viewed us, but did not think fit to come among&s;t us.</P>
<P>On the 30th we found our &s;elves in the Latitude of 62 d. 40 m. North, which was the furthe&s;t to the Northward that I ever was. And here I could not but take notice of the difference of cold in this place and in 60 d. of Southern Lati|tude. For there we had continual Show|ers of Snow or Hail, and the weather very cold; whereas here on the contrary we found the Weather very fair and mo|derate.
<PB N="300" REF="348">
<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="year"> The rea&s;on of which, I &s;uppo&s;e, was this. When we were to the South|ward, we were always pretty near to the Main of <HI>America,</HI> having it to the We&s;t of us. Likewi&s;e when we were to the Northward, we were always pretty near the main Land of <HI>Europe,</HI> having it to the Ea&s;t of us. Now being near the Land, we always account the Land-winds to be the colde&s;t, and the Sea-winds the warme&s;t. Thus the North Ea&s;terly Wind is accounted the colde&s;t Wind we have in <HI>England, Holland,</HI> &amp;c. But in the &s;ame Latitude North, near the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> the North We&s;t Wind is commonly accounted the colde&s;t. And in the &s;ame height of South Latitude on the Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> the South We&s;t Wind is the colde&s;t: As near the Cape of good Hopo the South Ea&s;t Wind is the colde&s;t. Now the We&s;terly Winds at &s;uch a height both in North and South Latitude, having ge|nerally the Predominancy over the Ea|&s;terly, very much alter the degrees of the heat or cold of the Weather. For which rea&s;on, in the South part of <HI>America</HI> the We&s;terly Wind cau&s;ed cold Weather; but to the Northward the We&s;terly wind cau&s;ed warm Weather. And as the Ea&s;t|erly-wind, being near the <HI>European</HI> &s;hore, is the colde&s;t; &s;o, being near the <HI>Ameri|can</HI> &s;hore in the &s;ame height of Southern
<PB N="301" REF="349">
<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="year"> Latitude, the We&s;terly-wind is the cold|e&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 3d of <HI>July,</HI> in the Evening, we &s;aw the I&s;lands of <HI>Faro,</HI> bearing Ea&s;t by North, di&s;tant about eleven or twelve Leagues. We al&s;o &s;ounded, but had no ground at two hundred and ten fathom. At twelve at Night we had ground at eighty-five fathom; and at three the next morning, at &s;eventy fathom. On the 4th of <HI>July</HI> at noon the opening of the two I&s;lands of <HI>Faro</HI> bore South Ea&s;t, di&s;tant about eight Leagues. We then &s;teering North Ea&s;t and ground at eighty fathom, &s;mall pieces of broken Shells. All la&s;t Night we kept firing a Gun once every half hour, to give notice to the Cruizers, whom we expected to meet here.</P>
<P>On the 5th, according to our Expecta|tions, we met with our Convoy, which had been cruizing for us. They con&s;i&s;ted of eight <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War, four Victual|ers, and three of the Companies Privateers.
