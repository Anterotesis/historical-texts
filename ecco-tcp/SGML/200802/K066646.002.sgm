</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SIBBALD.</HEAD>
<P>IT was late before natural hi&s;tory aro&s;e in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The &s;tory of a king <HI>Jo&s;ina,</HI> who is chronicled to have lived more than 150 years before the Chri&s;tian aera, having written a book <HI>De Viribus Herbarum,</HI> is not worth a comment. <HI>Fingal</HI> is &s;aid to
<PB N="2" REF="9">
have been well acquainted with the virtues of herbs: and <HI>Temory</HI> healed the wounds of his countrymen, by his &s;kill in vulnerary vegetables.</P>
<P><HI>Alan</HI> OGILBY, who flouri&s;hed about 1471, a native of <HI>Scotland,</HI> after having tra|velled through the ea&s;t, and re&s;ided &s;ome time at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> fixed at <HI>Venice.</HI> Be|&s;ides his eminent acquaintance with the oriental languages, he is celebrated for his knowledge of natural hi&s;tory. He left a book <HI>De Balneis,</HI> and &s;ix books <HI>De Virtuti|bus Herbarum.</HI></P>
<P>Of Dr. <HI>James</HI> CARGILL, of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> I can produce no material anecdotes, al|though he merits particular remembrance; &s;ince it is manife&s;t, from the nature of his communications to his friends, both on the continent, and at home, that he mu&s;t have been extremely well acquainted with the bo|tany of the age. There is &s;ufficient evidence that he had &s;tudied botany and anatomy at <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> during the time that <HI>Ca&s;par</HI> BAUHINE held the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip in tho&s;e &s;ciences, for whom a chair was fir&s;t erected in that city, in 1589. This celebrated profe&s;&s;or enu|merates Dr. CARGILL among tho&s;e who
<PB N="3" REF="10">
tran&s;mitted &s;eeds and &s;pecimens to him. GESNER records the &s;ame &s;ervices on his part. At home, LOBEL, in his "<HI>Adver|&s;aria,</HI>" acknowledges the like communica|tions, and repeatedly &s;peaks of him in very re&s;pectable terms, as a philo&s;opher, and as well &s;killed in the &s;ciences of botany and anatomy. He appears to have been living in the year 1603; at which time he &s;ent to <HI>Ca&s;par</HI> BAUHINE &s;pecimens of the <HI>Fucus digitatus,</HI> with the de&s;cription, which is &s;een in the "<HI>Prodromus</HI>" of that author. I know not of any publication from Dr. CARGILL, neither am I acquainted with any &s;ucce&s;sful efforts in the way of natural hi&s;tory, before the time of the BALFOURS.</P>
<P>The founding of the Botanical Garden and the <HI>Mu&s;eum</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> by Sir <HI>An|drew</HI> BALFOUR, may be con&s;idered as the introduction of natural hi&s;tory into <HI>Scot|land.</HI> Sir <HI>Robert</HI> SIBBALD, the friend and colleague of Sir <HI>Andrew</HI> BALFOUR, and who him&s;elf added to the &s;tores of the <HI>Mu|&s;eum,</HI> has written "<HI>Memoria Balfouriana,</HI>" purpo&s;ely to commemorate the liberal be|nefactions and encouragements given to
<PB N="4" REF="11" MS="y">
literature, by Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> and Sir <HI>Andrew</HI> BALFOUR.</P>
<P>The Garden was e&s;tabli&s;hed about the year 1680; and, in 1683, was &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully cultivated by <HI>James</HI> SUTHERLAND, the-intendant, that it is &s;aid to have con|tained 3000 &s;pecies of plants, di&s;po&s;ed ac|cording to MORISON's method. An ac|count of it was publi&s;hed under the title of "HORTUS MEDICUS EDINBURGEN|SIS; or, a Catalogue of the Plants in the Phy&s;ic Garden at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> containing their mo&s;t proper <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> names." By <HI>James</HI> SUTHERLAND. 8^o. pp. 367. Varieties, however, occupy a large &s;hare of this Catalogue, and very few of the native plants of <HI>Scotland</HI> are found in it. It was to Sir <HI>Robert</HI> SIBBALD that the fir&s;t attempts towards indigenous bo|tany were owing.</P>
<P><HI>Robert</HI> SIBBALD was a fellow of the College of Phy&s;icians at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the fir&s;t medical profe&s;&s;or in&s;tituted in that univer&s;ity, about the year 1685. He was knighted by <HI>Charles</HI> II. and had al&s;o the title of king's phy&s;ician and geographer
<PB N="5" REF="12">
royal conferred upon him, and was a man of very con&s;iderable and various learning. To the knowledge of his profe&s;&s;ion, he added that of natural hi&s;tory, and antiqui|ties. He was, if not the fir&s;t, among the earlie&s;t, who wrote on the antiquities of his country, on which he publi&s;hed &s;everal learned works, to illu&s;trate, more e&s;pecial|ly, the hi&s;tory of <HI>Scotland</HI> during the time of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>He publi&s;hed, "SCOTIA ILLUSTRATA; <HI>&s;ive,</HI> PRODROMUS HISTORIAE NATURA|LIS SCOTIAE: <HI>in quo regionis natura, inco|larum ingenia et mores, morbi ii&s;que medendi methodus, et medicina indigena explicantur, et multiplices naturae partus, in triplici ejus reg|no, vegetabili &s;cilicet, animali, et minerali ex|plicantur.</HI>" 1684, folio; and 1696, folio.</P>
<P>In this volume, which, he tells us, was the work of twenty years, one part is ap|propriated to the indigenous plants of <HI>Scot|land;</HI> it contains ob&s;ervations on the medi|cinal and oeconomical u&s;es. A few rare &s;pecies make their fir&s;t appearance in this book, particularly that which LINNAEUS named <HI>Sibbaldia,</HI> after the author; and the <HI>Ligu&s;ticum Scoticum.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="13">
Dr. SIBBALD having thrown out &s;ome &s;trictures on the mathematical principles of phy&s;ic, for which the learned Dr. PIT|CAIRN was a &s;trenuous advocate, the latter wrote a &s;evere &s;atire on this work, under the title "<HI>De Legibus Hi&s;toriae Naturalis.</HI>" Edin. 1696. But it contains nothing &s;olid, and was thought by &s;ome to have been the re&s;ult of party, if not per&s;onal di&s;like.</P>
<P>Among the "<HI>Mi&s;cellanea quaedam eruditae Antiquitatis</HI>" of Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> publi&s;hed in 1710, there is a Di&s;&s;ertation on the <HI>Chara</HI> of CAESAR<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Bello Civili,</HI> lib. iii. &sect; 40.</NOTE>, mentioned al&s;o by DIO, on which the &s;oldiers of <HI>Valerius</HI>'s army &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted, under a penury of bread. This root has been by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Kare|mile,</HI> Carmele, or, as Mr. LIGHTFOOT calls it, the <HI>Corr,</HI> or, <HI>Cor-meille</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See PENNANT's Tour in Scotland, vol. i. Appen|dix, 292.</NOTE>, of the <HI>Highlanders.</HI> It is the <HI>Orobus tubero&s;us Lin|naei,</HI> our Wood Pea&s;e.</P>
<P>In his "Hi&s;tory of the Sheriffdom of <HI>Fife</HI> and <HI>Kinro&s;s,</HI>" printed the &s;ame year, is a catalogue of plants, chiefly maritime,
<PB N="7" REF="14">
growing about the <HI>Frith of Forth;</HI> among which, he had given to one the name of <HI>Balforiana,</HI> now called <HI>Pulmonaria mari|tima.</HI></P>
<P>In the zoological way, Dr. SIBBALD publi&s;hed &s;eparately, "<HI>Phalainologia nova:</HI>" 1692. 4^o. or, "Ob&s;ervations on &s;ome Ani|mals of the Whale Genus, lately thrown on the Shores of <HI>Scotland.</HI>" This tract had merit enough to entitle it to a repub|lication, &s;o lately as in the year 1773. He meditated a <HI>Caetologia,</HI> together with the hi&s;tory of the other marine animals of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> in his &s;econd volume of the "<HI>Pro|dromus.</HI>"</P>
<P>In the year 1706, he communicated to the Royal Society an accurate de&s;cription, accompanied with a figure of the animal, and its &s;hell, named <HI>Balanus Balenae,</HI> or <HI>Pediculus Ceti</HI> of BOCCONE (<HI>Lepas Diadema</HI> of LINNAEUS, <HI>Sy&s;t.</HI> 1108.) The&s;e were publi&s;hed in vol. xxv. of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> p. 2314.</P>
<P>Although Sir <HI>Robert</HI> SIBBALD did not carry his re&s;earches &s;o far, as to rank high in the character of the naturali&s;t; yet, as
<PB N="8" REF="15">
having led the way in that branch, and &s;in|gularly promoted the &s;tudy of the antiqui|ties of his country, he is ju&s;tly entitled to that honourable &s;tation he bears among the writers of <HI>North-Britain</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His name was applied by LINNAEUS, in the <HI>Flora Laponica,</HI> to a &s;mall plant of the <HI>Pentandrous</HI> cla&s;s; which was known to <HI>Ca&s;par</HI> BAUHINE and others, and con&s;ider|ed by them as allied to the <HI>Fragariae,</HI> and the <HI>Pentaphylla.</HI> It was fir&s;t figured by SIBBALD in his "<HI>Prodromus;</HI>" be|ing found in <HI>Britain</HI> only on the <HI>Highland</HI> mountains.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>In the year 1700, was publi&s;hed, "An Account of the I&s;lands of <HI>Orkney,</HI>" by <HI>James</HI> WALLACE, M.D. F.R.S. which contains a catalogue of &s;ome of the indige|nous plants of that northern region. <HI>Flora</HI> is not exuberant in her gifts in the chilling regions of the north.

<P>I know not whether there was any &s;uper|intendant to the Garden of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> be|tween
<PB N="9" REF="16">
SUTHERLAND, and <HI>George</HI> PRES|TON, whom BLAIR &s;tiles an indefatigable botani&s;t, and who publi&s;hed, about the year 1710, the following Catalogue, written in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> "<HI>Catalogus omnium Plantarum quas in Seminario Medicinae dict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> tran&s;tulit Georgius</HI> PRESTONUS, <HI>Bot.

A writer of the &s;ame name occurs, though I know not whether the &s;ame per&s;on, as a corre&s;pon|dent of Mr. RAY. See his Letters, p. 308-316; "Some Ob&s;ervations on Mr. RAY's <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI>" by Dr. PRESTON, tending to illu&s;trate the characters of about fifteen &s;pecies of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plants; with &s;ome Stric|tures on TOURNEFORT's method of cla&s;&s;i|fication.</P>
<P>In the year 1716, Mr. <HI>Charles</HI> ALSTON &s;ucceeded PRESTON as &s;uperintendant of the Garden.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>ALSTON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> ALSTON, as we are informed by Dr. HOPE, was the &s;on of Mr. <HI>Al&s;ton,</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="17">
<HI>Eddlewood;</HI> a gentleman of &s;mall e&s;tate in the we&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and allied to the noble family of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who, after having &s;tu|died phy&s;ic, and travelled with &s;everal gen|tlemen, declined the practice of his profe&s;|&s;ion, and retired to his patrimony. His &s;on <HI>Charles</HI> was born in the year 1683; and, at the time of his father's death, was at <HI>Gla&s;|gow,</HI> applying with great a&s;&s;iduity to his &s;tudies. On this event, the Duche&s;s of <HI>Ha|milton</HI> took him under her patronage, and wi&s;hed him to have cho&s;en the department of the law; but his inclination for botany, and the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, &s;uper&s;eded all other &s;chemes; and, from the year 1716, he en|tirely devoted him&s;elf to phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>At the age of thirty-three, he went over to <HI>Leyden,</HI> to &s;tudy under BOERHAAVE, where he remained near three years. At that place, he contracted an intimacy with the late celebrated Dr. <HI>Alexander</HI> MONRO; and, with him, on their return to <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> projected the revival of medical lec|tures; where, but little had been done in that department, &s;ince the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the medical profe&s;&s;or&s;hips in 1665,
<PB N="11" REF="18">
under Sir <HI>Robert</HI> SIBBALD, and Dr. PIT|CAIRN. The plan was modelled by that of <HI>Leyden.</HI> MONRO was appointed to give lectures in anatomy, and &s;urgery; and AL|STON in botany, and the <HI>materia medica.</HI> RUTHERFORD, SINCLAIR, and PLUM|MER, were &s;oon after appointed to fill up the other departments: and, to the &s;pirited endeavours of the&s;e celebrated names, the univer&s;ity of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> owes the ri&s;e of that reputation, which has &s;ince &s;o de&s;er|vedly rai&s;ed it to be one of the fir&s;t &s;chools of phy&s;ic in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. ALSTON continued to teach botany, and the <HI>materia medica,</HI> with unwearied a&s;&s;i|duity, until the time of his death, which took place Nov. 22, 1760, in the 77th year of his age.</P>
<P>In 1740, Dr. ALSTON publi&s;hed for the u&s;e of his pupils, "INDEX PLANTARUM <HI>praecipue</HI> OFFICINALIUM, <HI>quae in Horto Me|dico Edinburgen&s;i, Studio&s;is demon&s;trantur.</HI>" 8^o.</P>
<P>In 1752, "INDEX MEDICAMENTORUM SIMPLICIUM TRIPLEX." 8^o. pp. 172. 1. <HI>Alphabetical;</HI> the officinal names, with numerous &s;ynonyms, from the be&s;t botani|cal
<PB N="12" REF="19">
cal writers, pp. 118. 2. <HI>Officinal</HI> names only; fo&s;&s;ils, vegetables, animals, in the order of his lectures. 3. <HI>Cla&s;&s;ification</HI> of the officinal names, according to the virtues; beginning with the ab&s;orbents, and ending with vulneraries. A table of the do&s;es of emetics and purgatives.</P>
<P>In botany, Dr. ALSTON's chief perform|ance was, his "<HI>Tirocinium Botanicum Edin|burgen&s;e.</HI>" 1753. 8^o It contains a repub|lication of his "<HI>Index,</HI>" fir&s;t printed in 1740; to which he now added the "<HI>Fun|damenta Botanica</HI>" of LINNAEUS. But the bulk of the work is a profe&s;&s;ed attempt to explode the &s;y&s;tem of the <HI>Swede,</HI> and parti|cularly to invalidate all his arguments for the <HI>&s;ex</HI> of plants. This part of it was tran&s;la|ted by him&s;elf, and publi&s;hed the next year in the fir&s;t volume of "E&s;&s;ays and Ob&s;er|vations, phy&s;ical and literary." 8^o. Could the doctrine of the <HI>&s;exes</HI> of plants have been ea&s;ily &s;haken, the learning and abilities of ALSTON were &s;ufficient to have effected his purpo&s;e. But as it was not at that time &s;upported by hypothe&s;is alone, &s;o it has &s;ince gained additional &s;trength, by new
<PB N="13" REF="20">
experiments, and &s;ound inductions, re&s;ult|ing from them. Nurtured from his early years in the &s;y&s;tems of TOURNEFORT, RAY, and BOERHAAVE, to the fir&s;t of which he had even given improvement, it is not &s;trange, that, at an advanced age, Dr. ALSTON rejected a &s;y&s;tem of &s;o much novelty, as that of LINNAEUS pre&s;ented. We do not willingly unlearn at &s;ixty, what has been cheri&s;hed from our earlie&s;t youth.</P>
<P>Dr. ALSTON's medical papers are, "A Di&s;&s;ertation on <HI>Tin</HI> as an Anthelmintic;" "A Di&s;&s;ertation on <HI>Opium;</HI>" and "A Ca&s;e of extrava&s;ated Blood in the <HI>Pericardium.</HI>" The&s;e are printed in the <HI>Edinburgh Medi|cal E&s;&s;ays.</HI></P>
<P>In 1743, he di&s;covered a property in quick lime, which led him to believe, that the power of lime was not exhau&s;ted by repeat|ed affu&s;ions of water to the &s;ame lime; he adds, even for twenty or thirty times. The fir&s;t notices of this paradox, as he then called it, were communicated to the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and were printed in the forty|&s;eventh
<PB N="14" REF="21">
volume of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;|actions.</HI> This opinion was conte&s;ted, and drew him into a controver&s;y with his friend and colleague, Dr. WHYTT. Having con|tinued his experiments, and enlarged his ob&s;ervations, he publi&s;hed, in 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">2, his "Di&s;&s;ertation on Quick-Lime and Limo Water;" republi&s;hed in 1754, and in 1757; in which he replies to Dr. WHYTT's Strictures; and, after enumerating a va|riety of di&s;ea&s;es, in which lime water has proved efficacious, confirms the opinion of his colleague, relating to its lithontriptic powers.</P>
<P>Dr. ALSTON's Lectures on the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> were prepared for the pre&s;s before his decea&s;e, and were publi&s;hed under the following title:</P>
<P>"Lectures on the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> con|taining the Natural Hi&s;tory of Drugs, their Virtues and Do&s;es: al&s;o, Directions for the Study of the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> and an Appendix on the Method of Pre&s;cri|bing.

<P>The fir&s;t eleven lectures con&s;i&s;t of preli|minary di&s;cour&s;es; on the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of this knowledge; on the operation of me|dicines; of errors concerning the <HI>materia medica;</HI> on cla&s;&s;ing &s;imples according to their virtues; and &s;ome account of authors who have written on &s;imples.</P>
<P>In treating on each &s;ubject, after reciting the officinal name, and the principal <HI>&s;yno|nyma,</HI> the de&s;cription, and place of growth, Dr. ALSTON gives, in his own words, the &s;en&s;ible qualities, powers, and u&s;es of each &s;imple; after which follows, in the words of the authors them&s;elves, a copious detail of the opinions of re&s;pectable writers, rela|ting to each; concluding with a recital of all the officinal compounds into which each &s;imple enters. Add to this, the reader will meet with a variety of collateral, and hi&s;to|rical information, which is highly gratify|ing
<PB N="16" REF="23">
to all &s;uch as wi&s;h to extend their en|quiries beyond the mere nomenclature, and quality of each &s;ub&s;tance; and which could otherwi&s;e be acquired only from laborious re&s;earches.</P>
<P>Although the reader will not find the author giving implicit belief to the mani|fold, and vaunted powers, attributed to num|berle&s;s &s;imples, through almo&s;t all preced|ing writers; but on the contrary, will meet with judicious doubts, ob&s;ervations, and experiments, yet, Dr. ALSTON's <HI>Materia Medica</HI> mu&s;t be con&s;idered, on the whole, as exhibiting rather the &s;tate of it, as it has been, than as it is, in the works of LEWIS, BERGIUS, MURRAY, and CUL|LEN. It is but of late that philo&s;ophers and phy&s;icians have exerci&s;ed that degree of &s;ceptici&s;m on the power of tmedicines, which mu&s;t ever influence the mind, when experiments alone form the foundation of medical practice.</P>
<P>Were it within my plan to extend my ob&s;ervations, I &s;hould, with grateful plea|&s;ure, expatiate on the improved &s;tate of

<HEAD>PLUKENET.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been the fate of many learned men, who have de&s;erved highly of the republic of letters, to have the private cir|cum&s;tances, and occurrences of their lives, in a few years, &s;o far involved in ob&s;curi|ty, that almo&s;t their immediate po&s;terity, how&s;oever de&s;irous of gratifying a natural and laudable curio&s;ity, and of rendering to their memory that tribute which their &s;er|vices have demanded, have been almo&s;t wholly fru&s;trated in their endeavours to re&s;|cue them from oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="26">
If I mi&s;take not, the truth of this po&s;i|tion is &s;trongly exemplified, in the per&s;on, of whom, in the order of time, I am next to &s;peak. Of Dr. <HI>Leonard</HI> PLUKENET, as far as I can find, there are &s;carcely any me|morials, but what are to be collected from the prefaces of his works; and they afford indeed very &s;canty information. He has told us, that he was born in 1642; but whe|ther he was of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> origin, and of what family, does not certainly appear; though it has been conjectured, that he was of <HI>French</HI> extraction. Where he received his &s;cho|la&s;tic education, or at what place he took degrees in phy&s;ic, I am not able to a&s;certain. Some light would be thrown on this cir|cum&s;tance indeed, by determining, where his two friends, <HI>William</HI> COURTEN, E&s;q. and the Rev. Dr. UVEDALE, of <HI>Enfield,</HI> were educated; &s;ince he &s;peaks of both the&s;e gentlemen, as having been his fellow|pupils: probably it was at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> as he had a &s;on, named <HI>Richard,</HI> pur&s;uing his &s;tudies in that univer&s;ity, at the publication of his <HI>Almage&s;tum,</HI> in 1696. Be that as it may, his writings &s;ufficiently te&s;tify his ex|ten&s;ive
<PB N="20" REF="27">
knowledge of the learned languages. He dates the prefaces to his works, from Old Palace Yard, <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> where, from a circum&s;tance mentioned in his <HI>Phytogra|phia,</HI> it may be inferred, that he had a &s;mall garden. I know not that he ever attained to any con&s;iderable eminence as a practical phy&s;ician. The contrary may rather be pre&s;umed, as I do not find his name in &s;e|veral li&s;ts of the College of Phy&s;icians, printed in the fir&s;t years of this century: neither in tho&s;e of the <HI>Royal Society</HI> at the &s;ame period.</P>
<P>His ardour for his favourite pur&s;uit was remarkably &s;trong; <HI>Ut pene nullus, &s;ic ardeo,</HI> was his motto. It does not appear, that he ever had an opportunity of gratifying his ta&s;te by travelling in &s;earch of plants. He &s;eems to have devoted all his lei&s;ure to his work of the <HI>Phytographia;</HI> &s;paring no pains to procure &s;pecimens of rare, and new plants. He had corre&s;pondents in all parts of the world; and had acce&s;s to the gardens of the curious, in the environs of <HI>London,</HI> and to that at <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> which was in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate, from the care which the
<PB N="21" REF="28">
king and queen be&s;towed on it. The Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> al&s;o, had &s;o much reli&s;h for exotics, as to have repeatedly &s;ent <HI>Jacob</HI> REEDE to the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> to collect cu|rious productions for the Royal Garden. PLUKENET was one of tho&s;e to whom Mr. RAY was indebted for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the ar|rangement of the &s;econd volume of his Hi&s;|tory; and that eminent man, every where bears the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timony to his merit. Neverthele&s;s PLUKENET wanted that pa|tronage, to which his learning, and &s;cience, entitled him; and he &s;eems, by his com|plaints, to have &s;everely felt it. In the lat|ter part of his life, he appears to have been at variance with SLOANE and PETIVER; two of the fir&s;t characters of the age, for knowledge in his own &s;tudies. He cen|&s;ures their writings, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, in a &s;tile of too much a&s;perity. Whether this alienation from tho&s;e of whom he had before &s;poken in terms of friend&s;hip, and re&s;pect, had its origin in jealou&s;y on the one hand, or what is more probable, on the other, in that indignant loftine&s;s, which too often accompanies the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
<PB N="22" REF="29">
neglected merit; or whether from other &s;ources, I cannot determine. It was how|ever probably unfavourable to PLUKENET, &s;ince SLOANE was at that time ri&s;ing fa&s;t into reputation, and influence. In the mean while, no ob&s;tacles damped the zeal of PLUKENET; he was him&s;elf at the expence of his engravings, and printed the work at his own charge, until the publication of the la&s;t part, his <HI>Amaltheum,</HI> when he pro|cured a trifling &s;ub&s;cription from a few of the nobility, amounting to about fifty-five guineas. Towards the clo&s;e of his life, he is &s;aid to have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the queen, and to have obtained the &s;uperintendency of the garden at <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> and was ho|noured with the title of Royal Profe&s;&s;or of Botany.</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;cover the exact time of his decea&s;e; but it is probable he did not long &s;urvive his la&s;t publication, in 1705.</P>
<P>There is a copper-plate print of Dr. PLUKENET, done in the 48th year of his age, prefixed to the <HI>Phytographia;</HI> with his arms, field ermine, bearing a bend dexter engrailed gules.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="30">
PLUKENET had all that enthu&s;ia&s;m, without which, few attain pre-eminence; and as the riches of <HI>Flora</HI> were daily pour|ing into <HI>Britain,</HI> from all quarters of the globe, he failed not to avail him&s;elf of every opportunity of adding to his &s;tores. Indi|genous &s;ubjects were, equally with exotics, the objects of this indu&s;trious, and learned collector. Hence at length, his <HI>Herbarium</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of eight thou&s;and plants; an a&s;to|ni&s;hing number for a private, unopulent in|dividual to collect! Of the&s;e, the <HI>Phytogra|phia</HI> is to be con&s;idered as the delineation of the new and rare kinds; and the <HI>Almage&s;|tum, Manti&s;&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Amaltheum,</HI> as the cata|logue of the whole.</P>
<P>The <HI>Phytographia</HI> was publi&s;hed at dif|ferent times. The fir&s;t part under the fol|lowing title:</P>

<P>PLUKENET follows no &s;y&s;tem; the Ca|talogue is alphabetical, and contains near 6000 &s;pecies, of which he tells us 500 were new. Synonyms are added to each, and re|ferences made to tho&s;e figured in the <HI>Phy|tographia.</HI> No man after <HI>Ca&s;par</HI> BAUHINE had till then examined the antient authors, with &s;o much attention, as PLUKENET, in order to &s;ettle the &s;ynonyms with truth: and many critical notes inter&s;per&s;ed, prove his intimate acquaintance with all the re|&s;ources of botanical literature.</P>
<P>Not &s;olicitous to form new <HI>genera,</HI> he refers, from the conformity of <HI>habit</HI> in al|mo&s;t all in&s;tances, his new plants to the <HI>genera</HI> of former authors; and, more anxious
<PB N="25" REF="32">
concerning the <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> he has de&s;cribed them with an accuracy that has been ap|plauded.

<P>Four years after the publication of the PHYTOGRAPHIA, came out, with a con|tinuation of the plates, "ALMAGESTI BO|TANICI MANTISSA, <HI>Plantarum novi&s;&s;ime delectarum ultra Millenarium Numerum com|plectens.</HI>" 1700. 4^o. pp. 192. tab. 329-354.

<P><PB N="26" REF="33">
It is in the <HI>Manti&s;&s;a</HI> we fir&s;t meet with &s;trictures on SLOANE and PETIVER. He cen&s;ures PETIVER e&s;pecially, with a degree of &s;atyrical acrimony, for errors in the ap|plication of &s;ynomyms in his <HI>Centuriae;</HI> and SLOANE for the like mi&s;takes in his "Ca|talogue of <HI>Jamaica</HI> plants;" accu&s;ing the latter of having al&s;o applied his &s;ynonyms from the <HI>Phytographia,</HI> without acknow|ledgments, or any reference. <HI>Hinc illae lachrymae!</HI></P>
<P>Five years after the MANTISSA, he pub|li&s;hed his la&s;t work, "The AMALTHEUM BOTANICUM; <HI>&s;.

<P><PB N="27" REF="34">
PLUKENET's work contains upwards of 2740 figures. Mo&s;t of them were engraved from dried &s;pecimens, and many from &s;mall &s;prigs, de&s;titute of flowers, or any parts of fructification, and con&s;equently not to be a&s;certained: &s;everal of the&s;e, neverthele&s;s, as better &s;pecimens came to hand, are figured a &s;econd time, in the &s;ub&s;equent plates. As he employed a variety of arti&s;ts, they are very unequally done: tho&s;e by <HI>Vander Gucht</HI> have u&s;ually the preference. The imperfec|tions of this work, however, are, in a great degree, tho&s;e of the times; yet it cannot but be regretted that PLUKENET had it not in his power to have given his figures on a larger &s;cale. There are unque&s;tionably many varieties exhibited as real &s;pecies; and one great defect runs nearly through the whole work, that the new plants are no further de&s;cribed, than by the &s;pecifical definitions, which, under the want of true generical characters, were then in&s;ufficient.</P>
<P>It is, notwith&s;tanding, a large magazine of botanical &s;tores; ina&s;much as, no work before publi&s;hed by one man, ever exhibited &s;o great a number of new plants. And as
<PB N="28" REF="35">
many of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;pecies are here figured, for the fir&s;t time, it has been equally ac|ceptable to the lovers of indigenous, as of exotic botany.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS, and others, mention a new edition of PLUKENET's works in 1720. But this was nothing more than the u&s;ual artifice of the book&s;eller; who, having purcha&s;ed the remaining copies, placed a new title-page. They were, however, re|printed, and divided into four volumes, in 1769, with the addition of a few plates, that were wanting in &s;ome copies of the fourth part of the <HI>Phyiographia.</HI> Tho&s;e who occa&s;ionally con&s;ult this author, will regret, that this opportunity had not been taken, of in&s;erting the additions from the <HI>Manti&s;&s;a</HI> into the <HI>Almage&s;tum,</HI> by introdu|cing them in a &s;maller character, and pla|cing the pages for both in the margin. The <HI>Herbarium</HI> of PLUKENET came into Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and is now in the <HI>Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum.</HI></P>
<P>In 1779, an <HI>Index Linnaeanus</HI> to the tables was publi&s;hed by Dr. GISEKE, profe&s;&s;or of poetry, and natural philo&s;ophy, in the <HI>Gym|na&s;ium</HI>

<P>Dr. PLUKENET has not failed to record the names of a numerous &s;et of benefactors, by who&s;e communications he was, from time to time, enabled to amplify his col|lection, and introduce many new plants to the knowledge of the curious.

<HEAD>PETIVER.</HEAD>
<P>CONTEMPORARY with PLUKENET lived Mr. <HI>James</HI> PETIVER, of whom too little intelligence is remaining.</P>
<P>It appears that he was apprenticed to Mr. <HI>Feltham,</HI> apothecary to <HI>St. Bartholo|mew's Ho&s;pital.</HI> He entered into bu&s;ine&s;s for him&s;elf in <HI>Alder&s;gate Street,</HI> where he lived the remainder of his days. He be|came apothecary to the <HI>Charter Hou&s;e,</HI> and obtained a con&s;iderable &s;hare of practice in his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He had an early propen&s;ity to the&s;e &s;tudies, and, excepting Mr. COURTEN, and Dr. SLOANE, &s;eems to have been the <HI>only</HI> one, af|ter
<PB N="32" REF="39">
the TRADESCANTS, who made any con&s;iderable collection in natural hi&s;tory. PETIVER engaged the captains, and &s;urgeons of &s;hips, to bring home &s;pecimens, and &s;eeds of plants, birds, &s;tuffed animals, and in&s;ects; and he directed their choice, and enabled them to judge, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of proper objects, by di&s;tributing printed li&s;ts and di|rections among them. He was not le&s;s anxious to procure, what his native country afforded, and was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in his efforts, that Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, who afterwards purcha&s;ed it, offered PETIVER four thou|&s;and pounds for his <HI>Mu&s;eum,</HI> &s;ome time be|fore his death: which offer, although it may be con&s;idered as a proof of the opu|lence of Sir <HI>Hans,</HI> is equally &s;o of the ex|tent of the collection.</P>
<P>The allurement of &s;uch uncommon cu|rio&s;ities as Mr. PETIVER exhibited, &s;oon obtained him con&s;iderable di&s;tinction, and his name became well known, both at home and abroad. He was elected into the <HI>Royal Society;</HI> and as his particular attachment was to plants, he became early the corre|&s;pondent of Mr. RAY, who acknowledges
<PB N="33" REF="40">
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in arranging the &s;econd vo|lume of his "Hi&s;tory of Plants;" and el&s;e|where owns his high obligations to him, for the extent and freedom of his commu|nications.</P>
<P>In the year 1692, preparatory to the pub|lication of his fir&s;t work, PETIVER took a tour into the midland counties of England. I recollect, on this occa&s;ion, the plea&s;ure I had in my youth, in &s;eeing the <HI>Lichen ju|batus</HI> growing on the &s;pot, where, I believe, he fir&s;t di&s;covered it, on the highe&s;t rocks in <HI>Charley Fore&s;t, Leice&s;ter&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. PETIVER's fir&s;t publication was, "MUSEI PETIVERIANI <HI>Centuriae decem.</HI>" 1692-1703. 8^o. Containing the names, and &s;ynonyms of various rare animals, fo&s;|&s;ils, and plants; among which, &s;everal cu|rious articles, the produce of <HI>England,</HI> are here fir&s;t exhibited; particularly &s;ome of the <HI>Cryptogamous</HI> cla&s;s, in the inve&s;tigation of which he was very &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>"GAZOPHYLACII NATURAE <HI>et</HI> ARTIS <HI>Decades decem.</HI>" 1702. tab. 100. fol. A book of great value at the time of its publica|tion, being the engravings, accompanied with
<PB N="34" REF="41">
&s;hort de&s;criptions, of animals of all the or|ders, vegetables, and fo&s;&s;ils: among the&s;e are many <HI>American</HI> ferns, plants of the <HI>Alps,</HI> and from the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> all, either very rarely &s;een before, or nonde&s;cripts. It will retain its value while LINNAEUS's wri|tings are in u&s;e.</P>
<P>Among the provincial li&s;ts of plants, printed in Bi&s;hop GIBSON's edition of CAMDEN in 1695, Mr. PETIVER com|municated the <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> plants. All the others were drawn up by Mr. RAY, as was ob&s;erved under his article.</P>
<P>Next to the <HI>Gazophylacium</HI> in the order of time, although not a di&s;tinct work, was publi&s;hed, in Mr. RAY's third volume of his Hi&s;tory of Plants, "PLANTAE RARIO|RES CHINENSES, MADRASPATANAE <HI>et</HI> AFRICANAE, <HI>&agrave; Jacobo</HI> PETIVERO, <HI>ad Opus con&s;ummandum collatae: cum eju&s;dem Catalogo Plantarum in Hortis &s;uis &s;iccis con&s;ervatarum, quae vel ineditae, aut hactenus ob&s;cur&egrave; de&s;criptae &s;unt: adjicitur Farrago Stirpium Indicarum, et Americanarum incertae Sedis.</HI>"</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e catalogues amounts to 184 plants: tho&s;e of the <HI>Hortus &s;iccus,</HI> to
<PB N="35" REF="42">
more than 800 &s;pecies: the la&s;t to 75. Although doubtle&s;s great numbers of the&s;e mu&s;t have been varieties only, the&s;e li&s;ts will yet remain a la&s;ting te&s;timony of the early and extreme diligence of this indefa|tigable collector.</P>
<P>In 1709, he publi&s;hed, without his name, "A Catalogue of Plants found on the mountains about <HI>Geneva,</HI> the <HI>Jura, La Dole, Saleve;</HI> with others growing in the fields, &amp;c. as ob&s;erved by GESNER, the BAUHINES, CHABRAEUS, and RAY."</P>
<P>"PTERIGRAPHIA AMERICANA: ICO|NES <HI>continens plu&s;quam CCCC Filicum vari|arum Specierum.</HI>" Tab. 20. 1712. fol. The ferns occupy &s;ixteen of the&s;e tables. Among the&s;e are contained mo&s;t of Father PLUMIER's ferns. The four remaining tables are of &s;ubmarine productions.</P>
<P>Mr. PETIVER neglected no opportuni|ties of augmenting the <HI>Engli&s;h Flora.</HI> He was the fir&s;t di&s;coverer of many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plants, as well as of other natural produc|tions, &s;ome of which he figured in the <HI>Ga|zophylacium;</HI> but he meditated, and in part executed, (a work that had not been at|tempted
<PB N="36" REF="43">
before) a &s;et of di&s;tinct figures of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> plants. Unfortunately he lived not to fini&s;h it.</P>
<P>This work, which di&s;tingui&s;hes PETI|VER as an auxiliary to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botany, bears the title of "A Catalogue of Mr. RAY's <HI>Engli&s;h Herbal,</HI> illu&s;trated with Figures." fol. 1713. t. 50; and continued "with the four-leaved flowers," t. 51-72. fol. 1715. Twelve plants are engraved on each plate. The work ends with the &s;eventeenth cla&s;s. The figures are little more than outlines, but they are neat; and though they have the defect of the old herbals, in being all on a &s;imilar &s;cale, were valuable, and e&s;pecially as pointing out many of the varieties in the <HI>Synop&s;is</HI> of RAY, particularly among the <HI>Apetalous</HI> and <HI>Syngene&s;ious</HI> tribes. A new impre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e plates was made under the in&s;pection of Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, in 1732.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the mo&s;t material works of PETIVER. His &s;maller publications a|mount to a great number, and are of le&s;s importance at this day, as being principally &s;hort catalogues and &s;ingle tables of rare

<P>Mr. PETIVER was among the fir&s;t who pur&s;ued the idea that the virtues of plants might be determined, in general, by their agreements in natural characters and cla&s;&s;es. I &s;ay pur&s;ued, becau&s;e the idea had been &s;ugge&s;ted long before. Even CAESALPI|NUS, the inventor of &s;y&s;tem, hints that the virtues of plants are pointed out by their &s;tructure, and alliance to each other. The&s;e are his words: <HI>Tandem et facultates, quas medici maxime quaerunt, tanquam proprietates innote&s;cunt ex naturarum cognitione: quae enim generis &s;ocietate junguntur, plerumque et &s;imi|les po&s;&s;ident facultates</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;alp.

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>PERSONAL NAMES OF GENERA.</HEAD>
<P>PETIVER and PLUKENET, as far as I can find, were the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> writers, who followed the example of PLUMIER in giving per&s;onal names to new <HI>genera.</HI> PE|TIVER is, however, &s;everely reprehended by LINNAEUS, for having conferred this ho|nour on &s;ome who did not merit it: He ob&s;erves ju&s;tly, that it is due to &s;uch alone, as have &s;ignalized them&s;elves in the &s;cience. I take this opportunity to remark the ri&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="52">
and progre&s;s of this eu&s;tom, which appears to be of high antiquity, &s;ince there are ex|amples of it among the antient poets, hi&s;to|rians, and phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>Poetry has con&s;ecrated, in this way, the names of <HI>Adonis, Daphne, Hyacinthus, Nar|ci&s;&s;us,</HI> and others. PLINY informs us, that <HI>Eupatorium</HI> is &s;aid to be the cognomen of MITHRIDATES, who fir&s;t di&s;covered the u&s;es of that plant. <HI>Gentiana,</HI> we are told, is derived from GENTIUS, king of <HI>Illyria: Ly&s;imachia,</HI> from LYSIMACHUS, king of <HI>Sicily: Telephium,</HI> from TELEPHUS, king of <HI>My&s;ia: Teucrium,</HI> from TEUCER, king of <HI>Troy: Clymenum,</HI> from CLYMENUS: <HI>Arte|mi&s;ia,</HI> from the wife of king MAUSOLUS: <HI>Helenium,</HI> from HELENA, the wife of <HI>Me|nelaus: Euphorbium,</HI> from EUPHORBUS, phy&s;ician to <HI>Juba</HI> II. king of <HI>Mauritania;</HI> though SALMASIUS avers, that this name had been in u&s;e at a much earlier period. Many other in&s;tances might be adduced.</P>
<P>In &s;ucceeding ages, the devotion of the monks led them to con&s;ecrate a variety of plants to the &s;aints of the kalendar. Thus we have the <HI>Herba Sancti</HI> ANTO|NII,
<PB N="46" REF="53">
<HI>Epilobium: S.</HI> CHRISTOPHORI, <HI>Ac|taea: S.</HI> GERARDI, <HI>Aegopodium: S.</HI> RU|PERTI, <HI>Geranium: S.</HI> JACOBI, <HI>Senecio: S.</HI> PETRI, <HI>Parietaria,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE wrote a treati&s;e, in 1591, now become very &s;carce, "<HI>De Plantis &agrave; Divis Sancti&s;ve Nomen habentibus.</HI>"</P>
<P>The re&s;torers of botany, in a few in|&s;tances, revived the practice. GESNER, had he lived to fini&s;h his plan in his "Hi&s;tory of Plants," intended to have perpetuated the names of his friends, by monuments of this kind. It appears, that he had reque&s;ted GUILANDINUS, <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE, KENT|MAN, CAMERARIUS, and our celebrated countryman Dr. CAIUS, to &s;elect from his new &s;pecies, &s;uch as they cho&s;e to bear their names, or allow to him the privilege of adopting what he thought mo&s;t congru|ous. By the &s;ame kind of tribute we learn, from his letters, that he propo&s;ed to record the names of his friends GASSERUS, OCCO, ARETIUS, and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>MATTHIOLUS, however, actually re|&s;tored the u&s;age, by the application of the term <HI>Cortu&s;a</HI> to a new plant, in honour of
<PB N="47" REF="54">
CORTUSUS, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of GUILANDI|NUS, in the garden of <HI>Padua;</HI> and CLU|SIUS followed his example, by calling the <HI>Contrayerva</HI> of the &s;hops <HI>Drakaena,</HI> in ho|nour of Sir <HI>Francis</HI> DRAKE; from which time it was &s;paringly practi&s;ed, until after the invention of &s;y&s;tem; and the con&s;truc|tion of generical characters, at the latter end of the la&s;t century. TOURNEFORT, PLUMIER, and PETIVER, led the way, and have been followed by all &s;ucceeding writers of note, and by none more than by LIN|NAEUS him&s;elf. It may be &s;tiled the <HI>apo|theo&s;is</HI> of botani&s;ts; and LINNAEUS may be compared to the high prie&s;t, who has thus immortalized a numerous group of cele|brated men.</P>
<P>The practice, however, was &s;everely cen|&s;ured by &s;ome of the older botani&s;ts, who objected, that the&s;e names, having no con|nection with the form, nature, habit, or properties of the plant, conveyed no idea of di&s;tinction. But the objection, if duly weighed, is of no force; &s;ince there is not, perhaps, a &s;ingle appellation, even among the be&s;t, of <HI>Greek</HI> etymology, however aptly
<PB N="48" REF="55">
framed, which conveys any character of the genus, that might not with equal propriety have been applied to a multitude of others.</P>
<P>The free u&s;e that PLUMIER made of this privilege, in honouring &s;o great a number of Engli&s;hmen, does equal credit to his own di&s;cernment, and impartiality, and to the merit of tho&s;e on whom he be&s;towed this laurel. On this account, I hope it may not be ungrateful to the reader, to digre&s;s &s;o far, as to introduce a &s;hort notice of this liberal-minded foreigner.</P>

<HEAD>PLUMIER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> PLUMIER was born at <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> in the year 1646; and, after a cla&s;&s;ical edu|cation, devoted him&s;elf to a religious life; and, at the age of &s;ixteen, entered into the order of the <HI>Minime Friars.</HI> Being early inclined to mechanics and philo&s;ophy, he &s;tudied mathematics, at <HI>Toulou&s;e,</HI> under <HI>P&eacute;re Maignan,</HI> a celebrated profe&s;&s;or of the &s;cience, and of the &s;ame order. In &s;ome of his lei&s;ure hours, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf in the practice of Turning, having been taught theart by his father; and became &s;o great
<PB N="49" REF="56">
a proficient, that he wrote a book on the &s;ubject. Under <HI>P&eacute;re Maignan,</HI> he al&s;o learned to make len&s;es, mirrors, micro|&s;copes, and other in&s;truments of philo&s;o|phy; and early acquired the arts of de&s;ign|ing and painting. He was &s;oon after &s;ent by his &s;uperiors to <HI>Rome,</HI> where his clo&s;e application to his &s;tudies, and to the&s;e arts, together with optics and mathematics, de|ranged his health. In this &s;ituation, he &s;ought for relaxation in the &s;tudy of botany, under the lectures of <HI>P&eacute;re</HI> SERGEANT, in a convent at <HI>Rome,</HI> and in the in&s;tructions of <HI>Francis de</HI> ONUPHRIIS, an Italian phy|&s;ician, and of <HI>Sylvius</HI> BOCCONE, a Sicilian. By the&s;e connections, he was in&s;en&s;ibly led to devote him&s;elf to his new &s;tudy. Being recalled by his order into <HI>Provence,</HI> he was placed in a convent near <HI>Hyeres,</HI> and ob|tained leave of his &s;uperiors to &s;earch the coa&s;ts of that country, and the neighbour|ing Alps, for plants. At this time, he con|ceived a de&s;ign of forming a new <HI>Pinax,</HI> or "General Hi&s;tory of Vegetables," for which he had made many drawings, and collected materials; but his &s;ub&s;equent de&s;tination
<PB N="50" REF="57">
prevented his making an effectual progre&s;s in this de&s;ign. He &s;oon after became ac|quainted with TOURNEFORT, then on his botanical tour in the South of <HI>France;</HI> and, together with GARIDEL, profe&s;&s;or of bo|tany at <HI>Aix,</HI> accompanied that eminent man in his re&s;earches.</P>
<P>Thus qualified, and while he was herbo|rizing on the coa&s;t of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> he was cho&s;en as the a&s;&s;ociate of SURIAN, to ex|plore the French &s;ettlements in the We&s;t Indies. The French were &s;timulated to this expedition, by the &s;ucce&s;s of our great na|turali&s;t, SLOANE, in <HI>Jamaica.</HI> PLUMIER acquitted him&s;elf &s;o well, that he was twice &s;ent afterwards, at the King's expence, to compleat the natural hi&s;tory of the <HI>Antilles;</HI> and was rewarded with the title of Botani&s;t to the King, and an increa&s;ed pen&s;ion each time. He pa&s;&s;ed two years in tho&s;e i&s;lands, and on the neighbouring continent; but made <HI>Domingo</HI> his principal re&s;idence. He made de&s;igns and paintings of many hundred plants, on a &s;cale as large as the life; be|&s;ides numerous figures of birds, fi&s;hes, and in&s;ects.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="58">
On his return from his &s;econd voyage, by the intere&s;t of M. PONTCHARTRAIN, he procured the fir&s;t &s;pecimen of his labours to be publi&s;hed at the <HI>Louvre,</HI> under the title of "<HI>De&s;cription des Plantes de l' Ame|rique.</HI>" Fol. 1695. pp. 94. tab. 108. The fir&s;t fifty of the&s;e tables repre&s;ent Ferns; the remainder, divers &s;pecies of the <HI>Arum</HI> genus; the <HI>Piper, Pa&s;&s;iflorae, Rajania, Dolichos,</HI> and various others. The figures con&s;i&s;t of little more than outlines; but being as large as the life, and drawn with great accuracy and freedom, they have a very fine effect. The de&s;criptions are in French.</P>
<P>On his return from the third voyage, he &s;ettled at <HI>Paris,</HI> in the character of his or|der; and, in 1703, publi&s;hed his "<HI>Nova Plantarum Genera.</HI>" 4^o.

<P>In the year 1704, he was prevailed on by M. FAGON, to undertake a voyage to <HI>Peru,</HI> to di&s;cover and delineate the <HI>Peruvian Bark</HI> tree. Nothing but the greate&s;t zeal for &s;cience, could induce a man at the age of fifty-eight, to attempt &s;o perilous a voyage. While he was waiting for the &s;hip, to em|bark with a new viceroy at Port <HI>St. Mary,</HI> near <HI>Cadiz,</HI> he was &s;eized with a pleuri&s;y, and died.</P>

<P>We are informed by Dr. LISTER, that PLUMIER left behind him drawings of plants, &s;ufficient to make ten volumes, equal to the fir&s;t book above mentioned.

From the latter, BOERHAAVE procured copies of 508 &s;pe|cies, done by AUBRIET, under the in&s;pec|tion of VAILLANT.

<P>The world was deprived of much of the fruit of his labours, by his untimely death. BANISTER increa&s;ed the li&s;t of martyrs to natural hi&s;tory. In one of his excur&s;ions, in pur&s;uit of his object, he fell from the rocks, and peri&s;hed.

<HEAD>VERNON AND KREIG.</HEAD>
<P>About the &s;ame time with BANISTER, as I conjecture, Mr. <HI>William</HI> VERNON, fel|low of St. Peter's College, <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and Dr. <HI>David</HI> KREIG, a German phy&s;ician, led by their genius for botany, made a voyage to <HI>Maryland.</HI> They returned, after having collected an <HI>Herbarium</HI> of &s;everal hundred new and unde&s;cribed plants. The&s;e came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, by who&s;e liberal communication they were in&s;erted in the "Supplement" to RAY's Hi&s;tory.

<PB N="58" REF="65">
and of all other branches of natural know|ledge. His di&s;coveries in the <HI>Cryptogamia</HI> cla&s;s were numerous.</P>
<P>Of Dr. KREIG, I can give no further account than that he was of <HI>Saxony.</HI> I con|jecture, that after his return from <HI>Mary|land,</HI> he retired into his native country. He was the friend and corre&s;pondent of DALE, who, in his <HI>Pharmacologia,</HI> introduces his name in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, for notices communicated by him; and ranks him among the few eminent men of the time, who excelled in the knowledge of the <HI>Ma|teria Medica</HI> and Chemi&s;try.

<HEAD>CUNNINGHAM.</HEAD>
<P>In the period we are now &s;peaking of, but few voyagers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any con&s;iderable knowledge of nature; or a &s;pirit of en|quiry, powerful enough to induce them to &s;acrifice their avocations, from intere&s;ted pur&s;uits, to the &s;tudy of natural hi&s;tory. SLOANE, BANISTER, and a few others, were indeed exceptions; and, in this &s;ketch, it would be injurious to his memory, not to add the name of <HI>James</HI> CUNNINGHAM, to whom RAY, and particularly PLUKE|NET and PETIVER, acknowledge important obligations, for his copious communica|tions of new plants.</P>
<P>The merit of Mr. CUNNINGHAM would ju&s;tly demand a more complete gratification of curio&s;ity concerning his life and circum|&s;tances, than I can &s;upply. I can only collect, that he went out in 1698, as &s;ur|geon to the factory, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Ea&s;t India Company at <HI>Emuy,</HI> or <HI>Amoy,</HI> on the coa&s;t of <HI>China;</HI> and afterwards, made a

<P>I conjecture al&s;o, that he was afterwards fixed at <HI>Pulo Condore,</HI> and was the per&s;on to whom we owe the account of the ma&s;|&s;acre of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by the <HI>Maca&s;&s;ars,</HI> at that factory, in 1705, as related in the Mo|dern Part of the <HI>Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory,</HI> vol. x. p. 154; edit. 1759. 8^o.</P>
<P>Mr. CUNNINGHAM kept a journal of the weather in both his voyages to <HI>China;</HI> and during his re&s;idence on the i&s;le of <HI>Chu&s;an,</HI> he appears to have been very active in col|lecting the productions of that place.

<HEAD>SLOANE.</HEAD>
<P>AT the &s;ame period of time, lived RAY, MORISON, PLUKENET, PE|TIVER, SLOANE, and SHERARD, under who&s;e countenance, and culture, the know|ledge of nature received the mo&s;t rapid and &s;ub&s;tantial improvement, which it had ever experienced. In this period, &s;y&s;tem had been revived and improved by MORISON, RAY, HERMAN, TOURNEFORT, and RI|VINUS. In this period al&s;o, RHEDE, RUM|PHIUS, PLUMIER, and SLOANE, publi&s;hed
<PB N="66" REF="73">
tho&s;e great works in exotic botany, which have immortalized their names. This pe|riod was the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century; which, as it has been called by the elegant and learned author of the "E&s;&s;ay on the Ge|nius and Writings of Pope," <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Gol|den Age of Learning in <HI>England;</HI>"</Q> &s;o has LINNAEUS named it, in his Allegorical Hi&s;|tory of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of this Sci|ence, "The GOLDEN AGE OF BOTANY;" and SLOANE was one of its brighte&s;t orna|ments.</P>
<P>Of the life of this great patron of natural &s;cience, it would be &s;uperfluous in me to attempt a detailed account; &s;ince this tri|bute has been paid to his memory in the "Eloge of the <HI>French</HI> Academy," in the "<HI>Biographia Britannica,</HI>" the "Biographical Dictionary," and other collections of that kind, in daily u&s;e. Hence, I &s;hall, from the&s;e publications, extract only the outlines of his life, as they are connected with, and tend to clucidate, his general character, his acquirements in natural hi&s;tory, and his bo|tanical publications.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE was de&s;cended from
<PB N="67" REF="74">
parents, originally of <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> extraction, and was born at <HI>Killileagh,</HI> in the county of <HI>Down,</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> April 16, 1660. His younger years were marked by a &s;trong at|tachment to the works of nature. At &s;ix|teen, his &s;tudies were interrupted by ill health, in con&s;equence of a &s;pitting of blood, which confined him for three years. On his amendment, he &s;tudied the preliminary branches of phy&s;ic in <HI>London,</HI> for four years; chemi&s;try, under a pupil of the great STAHL; his favourite &s;cience, at <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> Garden, then but ju&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed; and, young as he was, contracted during that time, an acquaintance with BOYLE and RAY. Mr. SLOANE afterwards, in com|pany with Mr. <HI>Tancred</HI> ROBINSON, and another &s;tudent, vi&s;ited <HI>France</HI> for improve|ment. At <HI>Paris,</HI> he attended TOURNE|FORT and DU VERNEY; and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have taken his degrees in medicine at <HI>Mont|pelier;</HI> &s;ome &s;ay, at <HI>Orange.</HI> He returned to <HI>London</HI> at the latter end of the year 1684, and became the favourite of Dr. SYDEN|HAM, who took him into his hou&s;e, and zea|lou&s;ly promoted his intere&s;t. In November
<PB N="68" REF="75">
1684, he was elected a fellow of the <HI>Royal Society;</HI> and, in April 1687, entered into the college of phy&s;icians. The&s;e early ad|vancements in the profe&s;&s;ional line, are the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umptions in favour of his &s;u|perior knowledge, and promi&s;ing abilities. Yet the&s;e flattering pro&s;pects he relin|qui&s;hed, to gratify his ardour for natural knowledge.</P>
<P>On the 12th of September 1687, and in the 28th year of his age, he embarked for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> as phy&s;ician to the Duke of <HI>Albe|marle;</HI> and touched at <HI>Madeira, Barbadoes, Nevis,</HI> and <HI>St. Kitt's.</HI> The Duke dying on the 19th of December, &s;oon after their ar|rival at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> Dr. SLOANE's &s;tay on the i&s;land did not exceed fifteen months. Dur|ing this time, however, &s;uch was his appli|cation, that, in the language of his <HI>French</HI> eulogi&s;t, had he not converted, as it were, his minutes into hours, he could not have made tho&s;e numerous acqui&s;itions, which contributed &s;o largely to extend the know|ledge of nature; while they laid the founda|tion of his own future &s;ame and fortune.</P>
<P>Here I am led to ob&s;erve, that &s;everal
<PB N="69" REF="76">
circum&s;tances concurred re&s;pecting the voy|age of Dr. SLOANE to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which rendered it peculiarly &s;ucce&s;sful to natural hi&s;tory. He was the fir&s;t man of learning, whom the love of &s;cience alone had led from <HI>England,</HI> to that di&s;tant part of the globe; and, con&s;equently, the field was wholly open to him. He was already well acquainted with the di&s;coveries of the age. He had an enthu&s;ia&s;m for his object, and was at an age, when both activity of body, and vivacity of mind, concur to vanqui&s;h difficulties. Under this happy coincidence of circum|&s;tances, it is not &s;trange that Dr. SLOANE returned home with a rich harve&s;t. In fact, be&s;ides a proportional number of &s;ubjects from the animal kingdom, he brought from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and the other i&s;lands they touched at, not fewer than 800 different &s;pecies of plants. A number, very far beyond what had been imported, by any individual into <HI>England</HI> before.</P>
<P>Dr. SLOANE returned from his voyage on the 29th of May 1689; and, fixing in <HI>London,</HI> &s;oon became eminent. He was cho&s;en phy&s;ician to Chri&s;t's Ho&s;pital, in
<PB N="70" REF="77">
1694. In the preceding year, he had been elected &s;ecretary to the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and had revived the publication of the <HI>Philo&s;o|phical Tran&s;actions,</HI> which had been inter|rupted from the year 1687. This office he held till 1712, and was then &s;ucceeded by Dr. HALLEY.</P>
<P>In 1695, Dr. SLOANE married <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> daughter of Alderman <HI>Langley,</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> She died in 1724. She brought him, be|&s;ides a &s;on, and daughter, who died young, two other daughters, who &s;urvived, and were advantageou&s;ly married; the elde&s;t to <HI>George Stanley,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of the county of <HI>Hants;</HI> and the younger to Lord <HI>Cadogan.</HI></P>
<P>It was about this time that he became an active member of the college, in pro|moting the plan of a di&s;pen&s;ary for the poor; which was at length carried into effect. The feuds excited on this occa&s;ion gave ri&s;e to the celebrated &s;atire from Dr. GARTH.</P>
<P>It was not till the year 1696 that Dr. SLOANE publi&s;hed the <HI>Prodromus</HI> to his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Jamaica</HI> Plants, under the title of "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM QUAE IN

<P>This volume, intrin&s;ically valuable as it is, my yet be con&s;idered as only the no|menclature, or &s;y&s;tematic index to his &s;ub|&s;equent work. The arrangement of the &s;ubject (and which was &s;trictly followed in "The Hi&s;tory,") is nearly that of Mr. RAY; vegetables being thrown into twenty-five large natural cla&s;&s;es, or families. Among botani&s;ts of that time, generical characters had not attained any remarkable preci&s;ion; and SLOANE, like PLUKENET, was little farther anxious, than to refer his new plants to &s;ome genus already e&s;tabli&s;hed, without a minute attention to the parts of fructifi|cation, farther than as they formed part of the character drawn from habit: yet with this defect, the figures and de&s;criptions of SLOANE proved &s;ufficiently accurate to en|able
<PB N="72" REF="79">
his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to refer almo&s;t all his &s;pecies, to the appropriate places in the &s;y&s;|tem of the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>By this neglect of con&s;tructing <HI>genera,</HI> SLOANE neverthele&s;s threw into the hands of PLUMIER the grateful opportunity which he embraced, of naming the plants of his inve&s;tigations after celebrated botani&s;ts. In ju&s;tice, however, to PLUMIER, it has been before ob&s;erved, that he was not par&s;imo|nious in the di&s;tribution of the&s;e favours, to the merit of <HI>Engli&s;hmen.</HI></P>
<P>It is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that among the&s;e cla&s;&s;es, there are only two plants be|longing to the <HI>Umbelliferous</HI> tribe, and but one genus of the <HI>A&s;perifoliae,</HI> namely, the <HI>Heliotropium.</HI> The ferns, on the other hand, are very numerous all over the <HI>We&s;t India</HI> i&s;lands. SLOANE has above one hun|dred &s;pecies; and PLUMIER, a few years afterwards, detected many more.</P>
<P>In this volume, however &s;mall in bulk, yet va&s;t in labour, there is a circum&s;tance much to the credit of SLOANE, which mu&s;t be obvious to every intelligent naturali&s;t. It is the care which the author has taken to
<PB N="73" REF="80">
con&s;ult every po&s;&s;ible re&s;ource, in order to di&s;criminate his plants, and avoid an unne|ce&s;&s;ary multiplication of &s;pecies, by de&s;crib|ing that as new, which was before known. So numerous a &s;et of &s;ynonyms had never been in&s;erted in any local catalogue; and SLOANE greatly enhanced its value, by a mo&s;t commendable addition; having, with incredible labour, referred to every traveller of note for all the vegetables renowned for utility in medicine, arts, or oeconomy. In this in&s;tance, it is much to be regretted that &s;o prai&s;e-worthy an example has not been more frequently imitated by &s;ucceed|ing botani&s;ts.</P>
<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s this volume, I mu&s;t mention an in&s;tance of the liberality of its author, in allowing Mr. RAY the free u&s;e of his manu&s;cripts of the <HI>Jamaica</HI> plants, on the publication of the third volume of his "Hi&s;tory," in 1704. Accordingly, we find all SLOANE's new plants, with the de|&s;criptions at large, in&s;erted in that work. He al&s;o communicated a li&s;t of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plants, which he had ob&s;erved &s;pontaneou&s;ly growing in <HI>Jamaica.</HI> This was printed in
<PB N="74" REF="81">
the &s;econd edition of the <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> and con|tinued by DILLENIUS in the third.</P>
<P>Dr. SLOANE began early to form a mu|&s;eum, and it was, by the collections made in his voyage, become con&s;iderable; but the aera of its celebrity was not till 1702, when it received the augmentation of Mr. COUR|TEN's valuable &s;tores. United by &s;imilar ta&s;te, Dr. SLOANE had formed, with this gentleman, an early and &s;trict friend&s;hip; and a perpetual interchange of communi|cations, and good offices, had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween them; of which Sir <HI>Hans</HI> him&s;elf bears public te&s;timony in his writings. It is not po&s;&s;ible, at this time, to a&s;certain the ex|tent of Mr. COURTEN's collection; but it is &s;ufficiently certain that it was very ample: the acqui&s;ition of it added new ardour and diligence to our naturali&s;t, in the augment|ation of it. He has him&s;elf exhibited a ge|neral &s;tatement of the contents of his mu|&s;eum, twenty-two years after its enlarge|ment by the above-mentioned collection. By this it appears, that the &s;ubjects of na|tural hi&s;tory alone, exclu&s;ive of two hundred volumes of pre&s;erved plants, amounted to
<PB N="75" REF="82">
more than 26,200 articles. They were af|terwards augmented to upwards of 30,600; as may be &s;een by "A General View of the Contents," publi&s;hed a year before his death.&mdash;And here I cannot but ob&s;erve, that the curious are under &s;ingular obligation to the author of the article COURTEN, in the fourth volume of the new edition of the <HI>Biogra|phia Britannica,</HI> who has, with great labour, brought to light &s;o many intere&s;ting me|moirs relating to Mr. COURTEN, and his family. His truly laborious re&s;earches have done equal ju&s;tice to that gentleman, and to Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, by re&s;cuing the hi&s;tory of their connexion from great mi&s;repre&s;ent|ation. Hence we learn, that Dr. SLOANE, as executor to his friend, &s;o far from ac|quiring the acce&s;&s;ion of Mr. COURTEN's mu&s;eum <HI>at a dear rate,</HI> as had been repre|&s;ented in the preceding edition, obtained it at a price greatly under its original, and real value.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SLOANE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1701, Dr. SLOANE was in|corporated doctor of phy&s;ic at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and was a&s;&s;ociated member of &s;everal aca|demies on the continent. In 1707, he publi&s;hed the fir&s;t volume of his hi&s;tory, under the following title:</P>
<P>"A VOYAGE to the I&s;lands <HI>Madeira, Barbadoes, Nevis, St. Chri&s;topher's,</HI> and <HI>Jamaica;</HI> with the Natural Hi&s;tory of the Herbs and Trees, four-footed Bea&s;ts, Fi&s;hes, Birds, In&s;ects, Reptiles, &amp;c. To
<PB N="77" REF="84">
which is prefixed an Introduction, where|in is an Account of the Inhabitants, Air, Waters, Di&s;ea&s;es, Trade, &amp;c. of that Place; with &s;ome Relations concerning the neighbouring Continent and I&s;lands of America." Vol. i. 1707. fol. pp. 254. tab. 156.</P>
<P>This volume is dedicated to the queen. The introduction contains 154 pages, and is replete with matter of an intere&s;ting na|ture, and evidently di&s;plays the great pains the author took to collect materials for this work. It comprehends a general account of the di&s;covery of the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and of the i&s;land of <HI>Jamaica</HI> in particular: the geo|graphy, the climate, and &s;oil; food, man|ners, and economy of the various inhabi|tants: de&s;cription of a tour the author made to various parts of the country, and e&s;peci|ally to the ruins of <HI>Sevilla,</HI> with an account of the church built by <HI>Peter Martyr:</HI> a li&s;t of more than fifty European vegetables, principally of the culinary tribe, cultivated in the gardens of <HI>Jamaica.</HI> He concludes with an hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;es, and the de|tail of many ca&s;es which came under his
<PB N="78" REF="85">
own ob&s;ervation. Then follows the jour|nal of the voyage; with ample de&s;criptions of the marine animals ob&s;erved in the cour&s;e of it: the plants ob&s;erved at <HI>Madeira,</HI> &s;eve|ral of which are figured in the work it&s;elf: ob&s;ervations of the like kind made at <HI>Bar|badoes.</HI> The remainder of the volume con|tains a methodical arrangement, and de|&s;cription, of all the &s;ubmarine, and herba|ceous plants, natives of the i&s;land; amount|ing to 550 and upwards. Very few &s;yno|nyms are here introduced; but references, in general, made to the copious collection of them in his "Catalogue." To each plant the author has &s;ubjoined, from medi|cal authors, and from travellers, the mo&s;t ample account of their &s;everal u&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd volume</HI> was not publi&s;hed till the year 1725, and was dedicated to the king. The rea&s;ons of this delay are a&s;&s;igned in the introduction, and were, principally, the care, the arrangement, and de&s;cription of his mu&s;eum. The acce&s;&s;ion of Mr. COURTEN's collection has been remarked above; and that of PETIVER, in 1718, gave Sir <HI>Hans</HI> much employment. PETI|VER
<PB N="79" REF="86">
had ama&s;&s;ed a greater quantity of the productions of nature, than any man be|fore him: but he had not pre&s;erved them with a care equal to the zeal with which he acquired them; and it demanded extraordi|nary diligence to recover them from the in|jury they had &s;u&s;tained. It is in the intro|duction to this volume that Sir <HI>Hans</HI> gives a general inventory of his Library, and Mu|&s;eum, as it &s;tood in the year 1725, which has been noticed before; and, by the com|pari&s;on of which with later e&s;timates, it ap|pears how greatly he increa&s;ed it after that time.</P>
<P>This &s;econd volume comprehends five hundred pages, and completes the vegetable part, and the animal kingdom. The new plants are nearly all figured. The plates are continued to the number of 274. The la&s;t forty belong to the animals, of which, &s;ome of all the cla&s;&s;es, the <HI>Mammalia</HI> ex|cepted, are here exhibited.</P>
<P>To the curious botani&s;t, it will be ob|&s;ervable, that out of 800 vegetables, de|&s;cribed in the&s;e volumes, above 100 are <HI>Ferns;</HI> and that of the others, more than 250 &s;pecies are of the <HI>arbore&s;cent</HI> kind.
<PB N="80" REF="87">
Sub&s;equent voyagers have e&s;tabli&s;hed it as a fact, that in the warmer and intertropical regions, this latter cla&s;s con&s;titutes, in a general way, the third part of the vegetable productions of nature. Abundantly the re|ver&s;e of this takes place in temperate and cold climates.</P>
<P>In the&s;e volumes Sir <HI>Hans</HI> has introduced all his quotations at length from the books of travels mentioned in the "Catalogue," to illu&s;trate the various u&s;es of each vege|table. They exhibit a proof of the author's indu&s;try, which, I conceive, it is difficult to parallel in any other work. The tables, which were principally engraved by <HI>Vander Gucht,</HI> although on a large &s;cale, yet hav|ing the di&s;advantage of being done from dried &s;pecimens, want tho&s;e natural atti|tudes which grace more modern perform|ances. In this volume, Sir <HI>Hans</HI> takes va|rious occa&s;ions to defend him&s;elf from the &s;trictures of PLUKENET; and, in his turn, critici&s;es that author, though in a language much le&s;s cen&s;urable than that of the <HI>Man|ti&s;&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>The voyage of Dr. SLOANE was produc|tive of much &s;ub&s;equent benefit to &s;cience,
<PB N="81" REF="88" MS="y">
by exciting an emulation, both in <HI>Britain</HI> and on the continent. Sir <HI>Arthur</HI> RAW|DON, upon viewing his &s;plendid collection, &s;ent <HI>James</HI> HARLOW, a &s;kilful gardener, to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> who returned with a &s;hip al|mo&s;t laden with plants, in a vegetating &s;tate; and with a great number of dried &s;pe|cimens. Of the latter, SLOANE had all &s;uch as were new, before he publi&s;hed his fir&s;t volume. Many of the living plants &s;ucceeded in the garden of Sir <HI>Arthur,</HI> at <HI>Moyra,</HI> in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and many were di&s;tri|buted into the garden of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> at <HI>Fulham;</HI> Dr. UVEDALE's, at <HI>En|field;</HI> the <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> Garden; and e&s;pecially into that of her Grace the <HI>Duche&s;s</HI> of BEAU|FORT, at <HI>Badminton,</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire:</HI> the botanic gardens of <HI>Am&s;terdam, Leyden, Leip&s;ic,</HI> and <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> &s;hared the&s;e rarities. TOURNEFORT &s;ent Dr. GUNDELSCHEI|MER, his a&s;&s;ociate in his oriental journey, into <HI>England,</HI> to view SLOANE's plants; and this gave occa&s;ion to PLUMIER's ex|pedition into the <HI>Caribbee</HI> I&s;lands.</P>
<P>Dr. SLOANE entered very early into cor|re&s;pondence with Mr. RAY. His fir&s;t let|ter
<PB N="82" REF="89">
bears date in 1684; and DE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">HAM's col|lection contains thirteen. Mo&s;t of them have reference to botanical &s;ubjects, while they evidence the mutual friend&s;hip of the wri|ters; a cirum&s;tance indeed very pathetically expre&s;&s;ed by Mr. RAY, in the la&s;t letter he ever wrote; which was but a few days be|fore his death, being dated Jan. 7, 1704.</P>
<P>In 1708, he was elected a foreign mem|ber of the <HI>Royal Academy</HI> of <HI>Sciences</HI> at <HI>Pa|ris;</HI> a di&s;tinction of the highe&s;t e&s;timation in &s;cience; and the greater at that time, as the <HI>French</HI> nation was at war with <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and the queen's con&s;ent was nece&s;&s;ary to the acceptance of it. He was frequently con&s;ulted by Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> who, in her la&s;t illne&s;s, was blooded by him. On the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of <HI>George</HI> I. he was created a baro|net; being the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> phy&s;ician on whom an hereditary title of honour had been conferred. He was appointed Phy&s;i|cian General to the Army, which office he enjoyed till 1727, when he was made Phy|&s;ician to King <HI>George</HI> II. He gained the confidence of Queen <HI>Caroline,</HI> and pre|&s;cribed for the royal family till his death.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="90">
In 1719, Sir <HI>Hans</HI> was elected Pre&s;ident of the College of Phy&s;icians, which &s;tation he held &s;ixteen years, and during that time he gave &s;ignal proofs of his zeal for the in|tere&s;ts of that body.</P>
<P>On purcha&s;ing the manor of <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> he gave the fee &s;imple of the <HI>Botanial Garden</HI> to the Company of Apothecaries, on condi|tions, which will more properly be &s;peci|fied in a &s;ub&s;equent part of this work.</P>
<P>On the death of Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> NEWTON, in 1727, Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE was advanced to the pre&s;idency of the Royal Society of <HI>London,</HI> the intere&s;t of which no man had ever more uniformly promoted. He made the Society a pre&s;ent of 100 guineas, and a bu&s;t of the founder, King <HI>Charles</HI> II. Thus, in the zenith of pro&s;perity, he pre&s;ided, at the &s;ame time, over the two mo&s;t illu&s;trious &s;cientific bodies in the kingdom: and, while he di&s;|charged the re&s;pective duties of each &s;tation, with credit and honour, he al&s;o enjoyed the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and dignified employment as a phy&s;ician. He occupied the&s;e important &s;tations from the year 1719 to 1733, when he re&s;igned the pre&s;idency of the College of Phy&s;icians; and, in 1740, at the age of
<PB N="84" REF="91">
four&s;core, that of the <HI>Royal Society;</HI> having formed the re&s;olution of withdrawing from the bu&s;tle of life into retirement at <HI>Chel&s;ea.</HI> In 1741, he removed his Library, and Mu&s;eum; and, on the 12th of May, fixed at his new man&s;ion, where, occa&s;ionally vi|&s;ited by his friends, and by all men of di&s;|tinction from abroad, he pa&s;&s;ed in &s;erenity, and in the con&s;tant exerci&s;e of benevolence, the la&s;t twelve years of his life, which ter|minated Jan. 11, 1752, O.S.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE was tall, and well made in his per&s;on; ea&s;y, polite, and en|gaging in his manners; &s;prightly in his conver&s;ation; and obliging to all. To fo|reigners he was extremely courteous, and ready to &s;hew and explain his curio&s;ities to all who gave him timely notice of their vi&s;it. He kept an open table once a week for his learned friends, particularly tho&s;e of the Royal Society. In the aggregation of his va&s;t collection of books, he is &s;aid to have &s;ent his duplicates, either to the Royal College of Phy&s;icians, or to the Bodleian Library.</P>
<P>He was governor of almo&s;t every ho&s;pi|tal
<PB N="85" REF="92">
in <HI>London;</HI> and to each, after having given an hundred pounds in his life-time, he left a more con&s;iderable legacy at his death. He was ever a benefactor to the poor, who felt the con&s;equences of his death &s;everely. He was zealous in promoting the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the colony of <HI>Georgia,</HI> in 1732; and formed, him&s;elf, the plan for bringing up the children in the Foundling Ho&s;pital, in 1739.</P>
<P>In the exerci&s;e of his function as a phy|&s;ician, he is &s;aid to have been remarkable for the certainty of his progno&s;tics; and the hand of the anatomi&s;t verified, in a &s;ignal manner, the truth of his predictions, relat|ing to the &s;eat of di&s;ea&s;es. By his practice, he not only confirmed the efficacy of the <HI>Peruvian Bark</HI> in intermittents, but extend|ed its u&s;e in fevers of other denominations, in nervous di&s;orders, and in gangrenes and hemorrhages. The &s;anction he gave to in|oculation, by performing that operation on &s;ome of the royal family, encouraged, and much accelerated its progre&s;s throughout the kingdom. His ointment for the <HI>Leu|coma</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="93">
has not yet lo&s;t its credit with many reputable names in phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of affluence, entirely the reward of his own merit, Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE en|joyed, through a long life, every &s;atisfaction that &s;cience could be&s;tow; and, in the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h Mu&s;eum,</HI> has not only erected the no|ble&s;t monument to his own fame, but a temple al&s;o to the culture of learning and of &s;cience, which will tran&s;mit his dona|tion to future ages, as a &s;ignal in&s;tance of the munificence of a private individual.</P>
<P>That the li&s;t of Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE's wri|tings may be complete, I &s;hall, in confor|mity with my general plan in other in|&s;tances, recite tho&s;e papers which were printed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</HI> Many of the&s;e convey &s;uch intere&s;ting lite|rary information, and abound with &s;uch facts and ob&s;ervations, as will long give them a value, with all who remember the eminent abilities and &s;ervices of the author, and have a reli&s;h for the like re&s;earches.</P>

<HEAD>ROYAL SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG tho&s;e public in&s;titutions, which in a &s;ingular manner invigo|rated, in this period, the &s;pirit of natural hi&s;tory in <HI>England,</HI> the ROYAL SOCIETY of <HI>London</HI> claims the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed no|tice. In its de&s;ign, as in its progre&s;s, it was the fo&s;tering parent, and guardian, of
<PB N="98" REF="105">
natural knowledge. The collection of a mu&s;eum of natural curio&s;ities, was one of the objects in view; and &s;uch was the re|&s;pectability of the &s;ociety, both as a body, and in its individuals, that, through its means, the whole nation may be &s;aid to have amply contributed to its emolument. All new objects of curio&s;ity; all new books, at home and abroad; new di&s;coveries throughout all nature, ince&s;&s;antly offered them&s;elves; and thus, not only tended to re|move the prejudices that too &s;trongly pre|vailed again&s;t the &s;tudies of nature in that age, but, in the event, excited a pa&s;&s;ion in the public, which was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully exert|ed in improving, not natural hi&s;tory alone, but real and u&s;eful &s;cience at large, that it will not be con&s;idered as an exaggerated encomium to a&s;&s;ert, that more effectual advancement was made by the influence of this illu&s;trious body in one century, than had before taken place from the ear|lie&s;t ages. Botany &s;hared the&s;e benefits; and the early volumes of the <HI>Tran&s;actions</HI> abound in records of newly-di&s;covered ve|getables, and of newly-di&s;covered proper|ties
<PB N="99" REF="106">
in that part of the creation. Expe|riments of various intention were in&s;titu|ted by this learned body. Under their au|&s;pices, the anatomy, and philo&s;ophy of plants, were illu&s;trated by GREW, and im|proved by HALES. Such memoirs in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions</HI> as more directly relate to my object, or were written by tho&s;e whom I commemorate, have been already, or will be, briefly noticed in the cour&s;e of the&s;e pages.</P>

<HEAD>CHELSEA GARDEN.</HEAD>
<P>I proceed further to ob&s;erve, that, among the a&s;&s;i&s;tances which the &s;cience has re|ceived from public bodies of men, mu&s;t be mentioned al&s;o that which &s;prung from the Phy&s;ic Garden, founded by the Company of Apothecaries at <HI>Chel&s;ea;</HI> an in&s;titution which reflected the highe&s;t honour on that re&s;pectable &s;ociety. This took place in the year 1673, although the in&s;cription over the entrance imports, that the Garden was not effectually con&s;tructed till the year 1686.</P>
<P>From the time of JOHNSON, the editor of GERARD, a cu&s;tom had prevailed among the <HI>London</HI> Apothecaries to form a &s;ociety
<PB N="100" REF="107">
each &s;ummer, and make excur&s;ions to in|ve&s;tigate plants. The <HI>Itinera,</HI> publi&s;hed by JOHNSON, may be con&s;idered as the fruit of &s;uch expeditions in his day. But they had been di&s;continued, as I apprehend, for many years. After the foundation of the Garden, this laudable practice was revived, and the a&s;&s;ociations fixed to &s;tated periods, and put under regulations; the herborizings being now di&s;tingui&s;hed into private and general. The fir&s;t, intended to excite a ta&s;te for botany among the apprentices of the Company, begin on the &s;econd Tue&s;day of April, and are held monthly, on the &s;ame day, till September inclu&s;ively, in &s;ome of the villages in the immediate neighbour|hood of <HI>London.</HI> At the end of the &s;ea&s;on, the premium of a copy of RAY's <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> (&s;ince changed for Mr. HUDSON's <HI>Flora Anglica</HI>) is pre&s;ented to the young man who has been the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in di&s;co|vering and inve&s;tigating the greate&s;t num|ber of plants. The general herborization is annual only, in July; when the Demon|&s;trator, and others of the Court of A&s;&s;i&s;t|ants, belonging to the Company, make an excur&s;ion to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from
<PB N="101" REF="108">
the city, collect the &s;carce plants, and dine together near <HI>London;</HI> on which occa&s;ion they are frequently accompanied by other gentlemen, who are fond of the &s;ame pur|&s;uits.</P>
<P>This in&s;titution at <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> was rendered more &s;table, and received permanency, from the liberality of Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE; who, &s;oon after his purcha&s;e of the manor, in 1721, gave the freehold of the ground, near four acres, to the Company, on condition that the demon&s;trator &s;hould, in the name of the Company, deliver annually to the <HI>Royal Society</HI> fifty new plants, till the num|ber &s;hould amount to 2000, all &s;pecifically different from each other; the li&s;t of which was publi&s;hed yearly, in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</HI> The fir&s;t was printed in the year 1722, and the catalogues have been continued till the year 1773, at which time the number 2550 was completed. The&s;e &s;pecimens are duly pre&s;erved in the archives of the Society, for the in&s;pection of the cu|rious.</P>
<P>Under excellent &s;uperintendants, <HI>Chel&s;ea Garden</HI> has flouri&s;hed; having been excelled, perhaps, by no public in&s;titution of the
<PB N="102" REF="109">
kind in <HI>Europe,</HI> for the number of curious exotics it contains. Of this, the Dictionary, and Figures of the late Mr. MILLER, af|ford &s;ufficient proofs. The advantages, in|deed of this in&s;titution are obvious; and even Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE him&s;elf acknow|ledged his obligations to it in the early part of his life.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice to the memory of tho&s;e who have eminently filled the place of lec|turers, and demon&s;trators, in the <HI>Chel&s;ea Garden,</HI> I recite their names, from the time of Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE's donation; not being able to a&s;cend above that period. <TABLE>

<P>Among the favourable circum&s;tances which contributed to di&s;tingui&s;h, or, I might
<PB N="104" REF="111">
&s;ay, helped to form, the <HI>Golden Age of Bo|tany,</HI> before alluded to, was that growing ta&s;te for the cultivation of exotics, which &s;prung up among the great and opulent, after the happy return of internal peace by the Re&s;toration. <HI>Archibald Duke of</HI> AR|GYLE is &s;aid to have been one of the fir&s;t, who was con&s;picuous for the introduction of Foreign Trees, and Shrubs. Mr. EVE|LYN, both by his writings, and example, encouraged the &s;ame ta&s;te. He cultivated a garden and plantations at <HI>Saye's-Court,</HI> near <HI>Deptford;</HI> and his <HI>Sylva</HI> remains a mo|nument of his learning, and patriotic in|tentions, which cannot &s;oon be &s;uper&s;eded.</P>
<P>After the Revolution, the Royal Gardens at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> were rich in fine plants, and that at <HI>St. James's</HI> of no incon&s;iderable note, if we may gue&s;s by the many new plants PLUKENET received from it. The <HI>Du|che&s;s of</HI> BEAUFORT had a garden richly &s;tored at <HI>Badminton,</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire.</HI> Dr. <HI>Henry</HI> COMPTON, Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> ano|ther at <HI>Fulham;</HI> and many private gentle|men vied with each other, in the&s;e elegant and u&s;eful amu&s;ements.

Dr. UVEDALE, of <HI>Enfield;</HI> of Mr. DU BOIS, an <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> merchant; of Mr. COURTEN, and others, were of the fir&s;t notice; and afforded much a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the labours of RAY, PLUKENET, and PETIVER. The growing commerce of the nation, the more frequent intercour&s;e with <HI>Holland,</HI> where immen&s;e collections from the <HI>Dutch</HI> colo|nies had been made, rendered the&s;e gratifi|cations more ea&s;ily attainable than before; and, from all the&s;e happy coincidences, &s;ci|ence in general reaped great benefit.</P>

<HEAD>BISHOP COMPTON.</HEAD>
<P>Among tho&s;e I have ju&s;t enumerated, Dr. <HI>Henry</HI> COMPTON, Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> claims peculiar notice; &s;ince we learn from Mr. RAY, and PLUKENET, that he joined to his ta&s;te for gardening, a real and &s;cien|tific knowledge of plants; an attainment not u&s;ual among the great, in tho&s;e days.</P>
<P>This eminent prelate, &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for his zeal in the cau&s;e of Prote&s;tanti&s;m, and for the active part he took in promot|ing the Revolution, was born in the year 1632. He was entered a nobleman of
<PB N="106" REF="113">
Queen's College, <HI>Oxford,</HI> in 1649, where he continued about three years; and after|wards travelled abroad. After the Re&s;tora|tion, he entered into the army; but very &s;oon quitted it for the church. In the year 1666, he became Rector of <HI>Cottenham,</HI> in <HI>Cambridge&s;hire;</HI> and, after po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing various emoluments in the church, was made Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Oxford,</HI> in the year 1674; and the year after, tran&s;lated to the See of <HI>London,</HI> which he held to the time of his death, in the year 1713, at the age of 81.</P>
<P>In his retirement at <HI>Fulham,</HI> Bi&s;hop COMPTON amply gratified him&s;elf in his favourite amu&s;ement. The circum&s;tances of the times, above mentioned, aided by his own zeal, and a re&s;idence of thirty-eight years on the &s;ame See, enabled him, finally, to collect a greater variety of Green-hou&s;e rarities, and to plant a greater variety of hardy Exotic Trees, and Shrubs, than had been &s;een in any garden before in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This repo&s;itory was ever open to the in|&s;pection of the curious and &s;cientific; and we find RAY, PETIVER, and PLUKENET, in numerous in&s;tances, acknowledging the
<PB N="107" REF="114">
a&s;&s;i&s;tances they received from the free com|munication of rare and new plants out of the garden at <HI>Fulham.</HI> Many of PLUKE|NET's figures were engraved from &s;peci|mens out of the Bi&s;hop's garden; and &s;ome from a book of drawings in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, quoted under the name of <HI>Codex Comptoni|en&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;econd volume of RAY's Hi&s;tory of Plants, p. 1798, we find a Catalogue of &s;ome new &s;pecies of Trees and Plants, ob|&s;erved by the author in this garden. The&s;e were principally of <HI>North American</HI> growth. The reader who is de&s;irous of &s;eeing a more ample account of the garden at <HI>Fulham,</HI> is referred to a relation of the &s;tate in which it was found in the year 1751, written by the late Sir <HI>William</HI> WATSON, and printed in the 47th volume of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</HI></P>

DOODY, the contemporary and friend of RAY, PLUKENET, and SLOANE, who all hear te&s;timony to his merit.

In this branch he made the mo&s;t nu|merous di&s;coveries of any man in that age, and in the knowledge of it &s;tood clearly un|rivalled.

<HEAD>LLHWYD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>EDWARD</HI> LLHWYD was one of the mo&s;t learned and celebrated antiquaries of the la&s;t century, and a &s;kilful naturali&s;t. According to Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> he was the &s;on of <HI>Edward</HI> LLHWYD, or <HI>Lloyd,</HI> of <HI>Kidwell,</HI> in <HI>Carmarthen&s;hire;</HI> but, as <HI>Boyer</HI> relates, of <HI>Charles Llhwyd,</HI> of <HI>Lanvordia,</HI> in <HI>Salop,</HI> E&s;q. He was born in 1670, and became a &s;tu|dent of <HI>Je&s;us College</HI> in 1687, of which Dr. PLOT was a member, and under whom Mr. LLHWYD was in a great mea&s;ure edu|cated.
<PB N="111" REF="118">
On the re&s;ignation of Dr. PLOT, he &s;ucceeded him as keeper of the <HI>A&s;hmo|laean</HI> Mu&s;eum, about 1690. He travelled repeatedly all over <HI>Wales;</HI> went through the North of <HI>Scotland;</HI> into <HI>Ireland,</HI> in which kingdom he &s;eems to have made &s;ome con|&s;iderable abode. He &s;pent &s;ome time in <HI>Corn|wall,</HI> and in <HI>Britany</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> in &s;earch of antiquities, and materials to carry on the exten&s;ive de&s;igns he had formed.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e journies he was con&s;tantly attentive to the objects of natural hi&s;tory, fo&s;&s;ils, plants, and any remarkable phaeno|mena of nature. Such of his remarks as are publi&s;hed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;ac|tions,</HI> are full of curious and new informa|tion on the&s;e &s;ubjects. His knowledge of the plants of his own country, and parti|cularly tho&s;e of <HI>Wales,</HI> ju&s;tly entitles him to remembrance in the&s;e pages, although he was not profe&s;&s;edly an author on the &s;ubject of them.</P>
<P>LLHWYD fir&s;t brought to light &s;everal of the rare plants of <HI>Wales;</HI> many of which, till of late years, were con&s;idered as natives of no other part of Britain. He di&s;covered
<PB N="112" REF="119">
&s;everal very &s;carce &s;pecies in <HI>Cornwall:</HI> all the&s;e he communicated to Mr. RAY, who in&s;erted them in the editions of his <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> with due acknowledgments. After having made very large collections for the antiquities of <HI>Wales,</HI> and formed great de&s;igns in litera|ture, he died before he could dige&s;t them into order for publication, in July 1709.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of large communications, made to Bi&s;hop GIBSON's edition of <HI>Camden,</HI> on the antiquities of <HI>Wales,</HI> he formed, from the fruit of his own inve&s;tigations, the <HI>Li&s;t of Plants</HI> &s;ubjoined to the account of that country.</P>
<P>He publi&s;hed, "LITHOPHYLACII BRI|TANNICI ICHNOGRAPHIA." 1699. 8^o. <HI>cum tab.</HI> 25. This work, which is a me|thodical catalogue of the figured fo&s;&s;ils of the <HI>A&s;hmolean</HI> Mu&s;eum, con&s;i&s;ting of 1766 articles, was printed at the expence of Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> NEWTON, Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, and a few others of his learned friends. As only 120 copies were printed, a new edition of it was publi&s;hed in 1760 by Mr. <HI>Huddesford;</HI> to which were annexed &s;everal letters from Mr. LLHWYD to his learned friends, on the
<PB N="113" REF="120">
&s;ubject of Fo&s;&s;ils; his <HI>Praelectio de Stellis Marinis Oceani Britannici, et A&s;teriarum, Entrochorum, et Encrinorum Origine.</HI></P>
<P>In Mr. RAY's corre&s;pondence, we meet with thirteen letters, written by LLHWYD; all, except one, bearing date in 1690, and the four &s;ub&s;equent years. They run chiefly on the &s;ubject of Fo&s;&s;ils. In October 1692, he informs Mr. RAY, that he was employed in drawing up a Catalogue of Mr. ASH|MOLE's <HI>Legacy</HI> of Books, Medals, and Pic|tures. In the li&s;t of his printed works, we find <HI>Catalogus Librorum Manu&s;criptorum in Mu&s;eo A&s;hmoleano,</HI> in 10 &s;heets, folio, without date. In 1707, he publi&s;hed "AR|CHAEOLOGIA BRITANNICA," fol. Vol. I. <HI>Glo&s;&s;ography.</HI> A work by which he will long be remembered among the lovers of antiquity.</P>
<P>From private information, I have learned that Mr. LLHWYD left a very con&s;iderable library, a large collection of manu&s;cripts and &s;pecimens; that in the year 1728, the&s;e were all in the cu&s;tody of Dr. FOWLKES, of <HI>Lhanher,</HI> who died &s;oon after that time. They were undi&s;po&s;ed of ten years after|wards;
<PB N="114" REF="121">
but the printed books, which were of great worth, had been valued by a gen|tleman and two book&s;ellers, and the refu&s;al of them offered to the Duke of <HI>Bedford.</HI> My intelligence reached no farther.</P>

<P>Of Mr. LAWSON I can only collect, that he lived at <HI>Great Strickland,</HI> in <HI>We&s;t|moreland,</HI> at the time he tran&s;mitted to Mr. RAY "A Catalogue of the Rare Plants of the North of <HI>England;</HI>" which is printed in the "Philo&s;ophical Letters," p. 213. This li&s;t clearly evinces, that the author mu&s;t have paid great attention to his &s;ubject; and, in fact, Mr. LAWSON fir&s;t introduced &s;eve|ral <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plants into notice. It is to him that we owe the botanical part of ROBIN|SON's "E&s;&s;ay on the Natural Hi&s;tory of <HI>We&s;tmoreland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland.</HI>"</P>
<P>The very frequent mention of his name in the writings of Mr. RAY, and the copi|ou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Catalogue of Rare Plants,</HI> di&s;|tingui&s;hed by him at &s;o early a period, in the North of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ufficiently confirm the character that eminent naturali&s;t gives him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of a diligent, indu&s;trious, and &s;kilful botani&s;t."</Q> It appears that he travelled

into various parts of <HI>England;</HI> &s;ince he re|cites plants collected by him on <HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> Plain; and, if I mi&s;take not, he made an excur&s;ion into the <HI>I&s;le of Man.</HI></P>
<P>I conjecture that he &s;urvived Mr. RAY &s;everal years: but he was not living at the publication of the third edition of the <HI>Sy|nop&s;is Stirpium,</HI> although he left papers, of which DILLENIUS availed him&s;elf on that occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>At this period mu&s;t al&s;o be introduced Dr. TANCRED ROBINSON, phy&s;ician, in <HI>London,</HI> and fellow of the Royal Col|lege of Phy&s;icians, and of the Royal So|ciety, between whom and Mr. RAY there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted the mo&s;t genuine friend&s;hip and affection. <HI>Amicorum Alpha</HI> is the di&s;tinc|tion which RAY gives him. The printed corre&s;pondence between them commences during Dr. ROBINSON's travels abroad, in 1683, and is continued for upwards of ten years.

<HEAD>DALE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SAMUEL</HI> DALE, of <HI>Braintree,</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> the friend and neighbour of Mr. RAY, eminent for his knowledge of botany; but better known as a writer on the mo&s;t im|portant part of the &s;cience, its application to the purpo&s;es of phy&s;ic. I am not fur|ni&s;hed with any anecdotes concerning this re&s;pectable writer, further than, that he practi&s;ed as an apothecary at <HI>Braintree,</HI> until about the year 1730; about which time he became a Licentiate of the College of Phy&s;icians, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. At this time, I appre|hend, he &s;ettled at <HI>Bocking,</HI> and practi&s;ed as a phy&s;ician until his decea&s;e, June 6th
<PB N="123" REF="130">
1739, in the eightieth year of his age. He was buried in the Di&s;&s;enter's burying|ground at <HI>Bocking.</HI> A print of him may be &s;een before the third edition of his <HI>Phar|macologia.</HI></P>
<P>He publi&s;hed PHARMACOLOGIA, &s;. <HI>Ma|nuductio ad Materiam Medicam.</HI> It was fir&s;t printed in 8^o, 1693, with the &s;anction of the College of Phy&s;icians, and we find four editions of it printed abroad. It was re|publi&s;hed at London in 1705 and 1710, 8^o, and a third time in 4^o, in 1737, pp. 460; which edition is much improved and en|larged. The arrangement of the work is that of RAY; and, to each chapter, throughout the vegetable kingdom, he has prefixed the characters of the genus, from the <HI>Methodus Emendata</HI> of that au|thor. He has moreover, with great labour, con&s;tructed a <HI>Syllabus,</HI> or &s;ynoptical view of all the articles under each &s;ection or cla&s;s, on a more amplified plan, than that of RAY.</P>
<P>The <HI>Materia Medica</HI> of DALE, in its fir&s;t edition, may be &s;aid to have been one of the earlie&s;t rational books on the &s;ub|ject.
<PB N="124" REF="131">
In an interval of more than forty years, between the fir&s;t and la&s;t editions, much of that credulity which had obtained, re&s;pecting the powers of &s;imples, among the writers of the la&s;t century, had abated. Se|veral excellent publications had taken place abroad, which, aided by improvements at home, enabled DALE to &s;elect better materi|als, and give his la&s;t edition the importance of a new work. Scarcely in any author is there a more copious collection of &s;ynonyms, a circum&s;tance which, independent of much other intri&s;ic worth, will long continue the u&s;e of the book, with tho&s;e who wi&s;h to pur&s;ue the hi&s;tory of any article through all former writers on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In 1730, Mr. DALE publi&s;hed, "The ANTIQUITILS of HARWICH and DOVER COURT," in 4^o, pp. 464. tab. 14. writ|ten by <HI>Silas</HI> TAYLOR, <HI>Gent.</HI> about the year 1676, with large notes, amounting to much the greater part of the book. How&s;oever re&s;pectable our author may appear as an an|tiquary in this volume, he is equally &s;o as a naturali&s;t, in general. His Hi&s;tory of the Figured Fo&s;&s;ils of the Cliff is very exact,
<PB N="125" REF="132">
and copious; and the view he has given, in a &s;hort compa&s;s, of the various opinions relating to the origin of the&s;e bodies, as held by the writers of the la&s;t, and the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, is very &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>His <HI>Synop&s;is</HI> of the animals and vegetables of the neighbouring &s;ea and coa&s;t, proves his intimate and critical knowledge of his &s;ubjects; and being embelli&s;hed with &s;eve|ral good copper-plates, renders his book a real acqui&s;ition to &s;cience.</P>
<P>It is highly probable, that, from their vicinity to each other, DALE owed to Mr. RAY, his attachment to natural hi&s;tory, and the great proficiency he &s;o early made in that &s;tudy. We find Mr. RAY acknow|ledging his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in collecting, and ex|tricating the &s;ynonyms of plants, correct|ing errors, and &s;upplying omi&s;&s;ions, for his <HI>Hi&s;toria Plantarum,</HI> of which the <HI>imprima|tur</HI> bears date 1685, when DALE could not be more than 26 years old.</P>

<HEAD>BRADLEY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>RICHARD</HI> BRADLEY, a popular writ|er on Gardening and Agriculture, in the early part of this century, was one of the fir&s;t who treated the&s;e &s;ubjects in a philo&s;ophical manner; and, as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable botanical knowledge, is entitled to a place in the&s;e Anecdotes. He fir&s;t made him&s;elf known to the public by two papers, printed in the xxixth Volume of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</HI> One "on the Motion of the Sap in Vegetables<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. xxix. p. 486.</NOTE>:" the other, "on the quick Growth of Mouldine&s;s on Melons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 490.</NOTE>." He became a Fellow of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and
<PB N="130" REF="137">
was cho&s;en Profe&s;&s;or of Botany in the Uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> in 1724. BRADLEY was the author of more than twenty &s;epa|rate publications; chiefly on Gardening and Agriculture, publi&s;hed between the years 1716 and 1730.</P>
<P>His "New Improvement of Planting and Gardening, both Philo&s;ophical and Practical," 8^o, 1717, went through re|peated impre&s;&s;ions; as did his Gentleman's "and Gardener's Kalendar," (which was the fourth part of the preceding book) both at home, and in tran&s;lations abroad. His "Philo&s;ophical Account of the Works of Nature," 4^o. 1721, was a popular, in|&s;tructive, and entertaining work, and con|tinued in repute &s;everal years. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of his "General Treati&s;e of Hu&s;bandry and Gardening," 8^o. 2 Vol. 1726; and of his "Practical Di&s;cour&s;es concerning the four Elements, as they relate to the Growth of Plants." 8^o. 1727. His "<HI>Dictionarium Botanicum.</HI>" 8^o. 1728, was, I believe, the fir&s;t attempt of the kind in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. BRADLEY was not eminent for any di&s;coveries relating to the indigenous plants
<PB N="131" REF="138">
of <HI>England;</HI> but exotic botany was indebt|ed to him for an undertaking, which there is rea&s;on to regret he was not enabled to pur&s;ue and perfect. I mean his book on <HI>Succulent Plants.</HI> As this tribe is incapa|ble of being advantageou&s;ly pre&s;erved in a <HI>Hortus Siccus,</HI> there is no part of botany that calls more e&s;&s;entially for a &s;eparate publication. His work bears the following title, "HISTORIA PLANTARUM SUCCU|LENTARUM, <HI>complectens ha&s;ce in&s;equentes Plantas, Aloen &s;cilicet, Ficoiden, Cereos, Me|locardium, alia&s;que ejus generis quae in Horto &s;icco coli non po&s;&s;unt, &s;ecundum Prototypum puta naturam in tabellis aeneis in&s;culptas, earum|dem De&s;criptiones huc accedunt et Cultura.</HI> 4^o. 1716. t. 50. It was publi&s;hed in <HI>Decads,</HI> at different times, between the years 1716 and 1727; of which only five were com|pleted. The whole was republi&s;hed in 1734. The de&s;criptions are in Latin and Engli&s;h, and the figures extremely well done in the &s;tile of the time. It pre&s;erves its value, as being cited by LINNAEUS, and as containing &s;ome plants not figured in any other pub|lication.
<PB N="132" REF="139">
A &s;pecies of <HI>Sedum</HI> is the only indigenous plant contained in it.</P>
<P>BRADLEY gave a cour&s;e of Lectures on the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> in the year 1729, which he publi&s;hed in 8^o, in the &s;uc|ceeding year. He died at the latter end of 1732.</P>
<P>Although BRADLEY's writings do not abound in new di&s;coveries, yet they are not de&s;titute of intere&s;ting knowledge, collected from contemporary gardeners, and from books. He was an advocate for the circu|lation of the &s;ap, and made &s;everal new ob|&s;ervations on the &s;exes of plants, in con&s;e|quence of the production of hybrid &s;pecies, by which he added &s;trength to that doc|trine. He wrote in&s;tructively on the gems of trees; on bulbs; on grafting; and par|ticularly, on the methods of producing va|riegated and double flowers.</P>
<P>On the whole, BRADLEY's writings, coinciding with the growing ta&s;te for gar|dening, the introduction of exotics, and improvements in hu&s;bandry, contributed to excite a more philo&s;ophical view of the&s;e
<PB N="133" REF="140">
arts, and diffu&s;e a general and popular knowledge of them throughout the king|dom.</P>
<P>The indu&s;try and talents of BRADLEY were not mean; and though unadorned by learning, were &s;ufficient to have &s;ecured to him, that reputable degree of re&s;pect from po&s;terity, which it will ever ju&s;tly with|hold from him who fails to recommend &s;uch qualifications, by integrity and pro|priety of conduct. In the&s;e, unhappily, Mr. BRADLEY was deficient. We learn, from the account given of him by Mr. MARTYN, that he procured the profe&s;&s;or|&s;hip in a clande&s;tine and fraudulent man|ner, and afterwards neglected to perform the duties of it. The Univer&s;ity, neverthele&s;s, allowed him to retain the nominal di&s;tinction of Profe&s;&s;or, and appointed Dr. MARTYN to give the lectures. Near the conclu&s;ion of his life, his conduct was &s;o unbecoming, that it was in agitation to deprive him of this nominal title.</P>

<HEAD>BLAIR.</HEAD>
<P>Dr. <HI>Patrick</HI> BLAIR was a native of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and practi&s;ed phy&s;ic and &s;urgery at <HI>Dundee;</HI> where he made him&s;elf fir&s;t known as an anatomi&s;t, by the di&s;&s;ection of an ele|phant, which died near that place, in 1706. He was a Nonjuror, and &s;o far attached to the exiled family, as to have been im|pri&s;oned in the rebellion in 1715, as a &s;u&s;pected per&s;on. He afterwards removed to <HI>London,</HI> where he recommended him&s;elf to the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> by &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;es on the Sexes of Flowers. His &s;tay in <HI>London</HI> was not long; he quitted it, and &s;ettled at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire;</HI> where, if I mi&s;take not, he practi&s;ed phy&s;ic during the remain|der of his life. I am not able to a&s;cer|tain the time of his decea&s;e; but I con|jecture that it was &s;oon after the publica|tion of the Seventh <HI>Decad</HI> of his <HI>Pharmaco|botanologia,</HI> in 1728.</P>
<P>Dr. BLAIR's fir&s;t publication was inti|tuled "Mi&s;cellaneous Ob&s;ervations in Phy|&s;ic, Anatomy, Surgery, and Botanicks." 8^o, 1718. In the botanical part of this
<PB N="135" REF="142">
work, he in&s;inuates &s;ome doubts relating to the method &s;ugge&s;ted by PETIVER, and others, of deducing the qualities of vege|tables, from the agreement in natural cha|racters; and in&s;tances the <HI>Cynoglo&s;&s;um,</HI> as tending to prove the fallacy of this rule. He relates &s;everal in&s;tances of the poi&s;onous effects of plants; and thinks the <HI>Echium Marinum</HI> (<HI>Pulmonaria Maritima</HI> Lin.) &s;hould be ranked in the genus <HI>Cynoglo&s;&s;um,</HI> &s;ince it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a narcotic power. He de&s;cribes, and figures, &s;everal of the more rare <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> plants, which he had di&s;cover|ed in a tour made into <HI>Wales.</HI> e. g.

Dr. BLAIR's treati&s;e, as far as I can find, was the fir&s;t compleat work, at lea&s;t in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> language, written on the &s;ub|ject; and the author &s;hews him&s;elf well ac|quainted, in general, with all the opinions, and arguments of authors, on the matter of each e&s;&s;ay.

<HEAD>DR. WILLIAM SHERARD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WILLIAM</HI> SHERARD, or <HI>Sherwood,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>George Sherwood,</HI> of <HI>Bu&s;hby,</HI> in <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> was born in 1659, and educated at Merchant Taylors' School, till he was entered at <HI>St. John's</HI> College, <HI>Oxford,</HI> in the year 1677. Of this college he became a Fellow, and took the degree of Bachelor of Law, Dec. 11, 1683. After this time, he accompanied <HI>Lord Vi&s;count Town&s;hevd</HI> in his travels; and di&s;charged
<PB N="142" REF="149">
his tru&s;t with &s;o much reputation, that he was prevailed on to take the charge of <HI>Wriothe&s;ly,</HI> grand&s;on of <HI>William,</HI> fir&s;t <HI>Duke of</HI> BEDFORD; and made a &s;econd tour to the continent, with equal &s;atisfaction to the noble family who confided in him.</P>
<P>He returned from this tour, as I con|jecture, about the year 1693; and commu|nicated to Mr. RAY a Catalogue of Plants, which he had remarked on Mount <HI>Jura, Saleve,</HI> and the neighbourhood of <HI>Geneva.</HI> This was publi&s;hed as a Supplement in RAY's "<HI>Sylloge Stirpium Europaearum.</HI>" About this time we find he was in <HI>Ireland,</HI> with his friend Sir <HI>Arthur</HI> RAWDON, at <HI>Moyra;</HI> of whom mention has been made in the article SLOANE.</P>
<P>In travelling, SHERARD gratified his fa|vourite pa&s;&s;ion, and formed connections with the mo&s;t celebrated characters on the continent, HERMAN, BOERHAAVE, and TOURNEFORT. He was very early &s;killed in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botany; and although his publi|cations are few, there is no doubt that he had be&s;towed great a&s;&s;iduity in the &s;tudy of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plants. Need I allege any farther
<PB N="143" REF="150">
evidence, than the obligations, already men|tioned, which Mr. RAY acknowledges for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his "Hi&s;tory of Plants." He travelled early into various parts of <HI>England,</HI> and was ever attentive to make di&s;coveries. He made the tour of the We&s;t as far as into <HI>Cornwall.</HI> He &s;earched the i&s;land of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> and communicated a Li&s;t of Plants to Mr. RAY, to be in&s;erted in the fir&s;t edition of the <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> printed in 1690.</P>
<P>He is &s;aid to have been the author of a book publi&s;hed under the name of <HI>Samuel</HI> WHARTON, "<HI>Schola Botanica; &s;ive, Cata|logus Plantarum quas ab aliquot Annis in Horto Regio Pari&s;ien&s;i Studio&s;is indigitavit Jo&s;. Pet.</HI> TOURNEFORT." <HI>Am&s;t.</HI> 1689. 12^o. It was reprinted in 1691, and 1699. If indeed SHERARD was the author of this book, he mu&s;t have attended the lectures of TOURNE|FORT three &s;everal &s;ea&s;ons. It contains a rude &s;ketch of TOURNEFORT's Method of Botany, exemplified in a large catalogue of plants; among which are innumerable va|rieties, &s;ome new &s;pecies collected by TOURNEFORT him&s;elf in the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="151">
Mountains, and others introduced by the care of M. FAGON.</P>
<P>It is to SHERARD al&s;o, that the learned owe the publication of HERMAN's "<HI>Para|di&s;us Batavus, continens plus centum Plantas affabre Aere inci&s;as, et De&s;criptionibus illu&s;|tratas.</HI>" 4^o. <HI>Lugd. Bat.</HI> 1698. He wrote a preface to this work, in which he relates the difficulties he met with, in reducing the author's papers into method; and which contains an account of other works of HERMAN. This preface is dated from <HI>Ge|neva,</HI> in April 1697; at which time, I ap|prehend, SHERARD was on his third tour, on the continent.</P>
<P>In the year 1700, Mr. SHERARD com|municated to the Royal Society a Method of making &s;everal <HI>China</HI> Varni&s;hes, which were &s;ent from the Je&s;uits in <HI>China</HI> to the Great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany.</HI> It was publi&s;hed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> N^o 262. Vol. xxii. p. 525. And the next year he communicated to the Society a paper from Dr. J. DEL PASSA, on the poi&s;onous Ef|fects of the <HI>Indian</HI> Varni&s;h on the human Skin; which on the naked Skin of Poultry
<PB N="145" REF="152">
proved quite harmle&s;s. How &s;oon after this time he was engaged in any public employment, I cannot determine: but, in 1702, he was one of the commi&s;&s;ioners for &s;ick and wounded &s;eamen at <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> and, I believe, was &s;oon after appointed con&s;ul at <HI>Smyrna;</HI> a department, which, it is probable, his de&s;ire of inve&s;tigating the plants of the Ea&s;t had no &s;mall &s;hare in inducing him to accept. But SHERARD's knowledge and ta&s;te was not confined to the &s;tudy of botany. Mr. MARTYN in|forms us, that, <Q REND="inline">"in 1705, with <HI>Antonio</HI> PICENINI, he vi&s;ited the &s;even churches of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> In 1709 and 1716, he tran&s;cribed the <HI>Monumenta Teia,</HI> and cau&s;ed the <HI>Sigean</HI> in&s;cription to be copied and &s;ent to <HI>Eng|land;</HI> and the learned Dr. CHISHULL de|dicates his account of it to him."</Q> He al&s;o &s;ent an account of the i&s;land rai&s;ed near <HI>Santorini,</HI> in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> on the 12th of May, 1707; which was printed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> N^o 314.

In 1749, HASSELQUIST vi|&s;ited this retreat, and viewed, with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a young botani&s;t, the &s;pot where <Q REND="inline">"the regent of the botanic world,"</Q> as he &s;tiles him, &s;pent his &s;ummers, and cultivated his garden. Here SHERARD collected &s;pecimens of all the plants of <HI>Na|tolia</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> and began that famous <HI>Herbarium,</HI> which at length became the mo&s;t exten&s;ive that had ever been &s;een as the work of one man, &s;ince it is &s;aid final|ly to have contained 12,000 &s;pecies. And here he is &s;aid to have begun the much-celebrated <HI>Pinax,</HI> to which he continued to make acce&s;&s;ions throughout his life. He returned into <HI>England,</HI> in 1718. Soon after which time, he had the degree of Doctor of Laws conferred upon him by the Uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>In 1721, Dr. SHERARD communicated to the Royal Society an Account of the Poi&s;on Wood Tree of <HI>New England,</HI> which he had received from Mr. MORE. It does not appear that the &s;pecies had been a&s;cer|tained till Dr. SHERARD pointed it out as

<P>In this year he returned to the continent, and made the tour of <HI>Holland, France,</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> Whil&s;t at <HI>Paris,</HI> he found VAIL|LANT in a declining &s;tate of health; but, anxious to pre&s;erve his papers from obli|vion, VAILLANT had &s;olicited BOER|HAAVE to purcha&s;e, and to publi&s;h them. SHERARD negociated the bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;pent the greate&s;t part of the &s;ummer with BOERHAAVE, in reducing the manu&s;cripts into order. To SHERARD, therefore, prin|cipally, the learned owe the <HI>Botanicon Pa|ri&s;ien&s;e,</HI> which was publi&s;hed in 1727. BOERHAAVE prefixed to this work a <HI>Latin</HI> letter, written by Dr. SHERARD, giving an account of this tran&s;action; which is al&s;o more fully explained in the preface. It was in this tour, that, being in &s;earch of plants in the <HI>Alps,</HI> he narrowly e&s;caped be|ing &s;hot by a pea&s;ant for a wolf.</P>
<P>On his return, he brought over with him the celebrated DILLENIUS, with

whom he had before corre&s;ponded, and whom he had encouraged to pro&s;ecute his enquiries into the <HI>Cryptogamia</HI> cla&s;s, and in publi&s;hing his <HI>Plantae Gi&s;&s;en&s;es.</HI> SHERARD had him&s;elf been among the earlie&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> to promote attention to this hi|therto neglected part of nature; and in this DILLENIUS had already excelled all who had written before him.</P>
<P>Although Dr. SHERARD had acquired a con&s;iderable fortune in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> yet he lived with the greate&s;t privacy in <HI>London,</HI> wholly immer&s;ed in the &s;tudy of natural hi&s;tory; except when he went to his brother's &s;eat and fine garden at <HI>Eltham.</HI> Dr. DIL|LENIUS a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his chief employ|ment, the carrying on his <HI>Pinax,</HI> or Col|lection of all the names, which had been given by botanical writers to each plant; being a continuation of <HI>Ca&s;par</HI> BAUHINE's great plan.</P>
<P>Dr. SHERARD was, in a particular man|ner, the patron of Mr. <HI>Mark</HI> CATESBY; and him&s;elf affixed the <HI>Latin</HI> names to the plants of "The Natural Hi&s;tory of <HI>Caro|lina.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="156">
He died Augu&s;t 12, 1728; and, by his will, gave three thou&s;and pounds, to pro|vide a &s;alary for a profe&s;&s;or of botany at <HI>Oxford,</HI> on condition, that Dr. DILLENIUS &s;hould be cho&s;en fir&s;t profe&s;&s;or.

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>DILLENIUS.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER SHERARD, I am led in chronological cour&s;e, as well as by other a&s;&s;ociations, to a character of the highe&s;t worth in botanical &s;cience. That harmony of ta&s;te, and co-operation of de|&s;ign, which fir&s;t connected SHERARD and DILLENIUS, hath in&s;eparably united their names, as long as their works &s;hall endure. DILLENIUS, though not an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> born, is gratefully naturalized by a nation,
<PB N="154" REF="161">
to who&s;e botanical fame he gave an emi|nence it had not experienced from the time of RAY. It was no mean &s;acrifice to re|linqui&s;h his country, his friends, his con|nexions, and his pro&s;pects from a profe&s;|&s;ion, which is, at lea&s;t &s;ometimes, lucrative, that he might devote him&s;elf to the culture of &s;cience, in a foreign land, where the ex|tent of his views was mo&s;t probably bound|ed by the precarious hope of a profe&s;&s;or&s;hip alone.</P>
<P><HI>John Jacob</HI> DILLENIUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a letter extant, written by DILLENIUS, in 1727, in which he tells his corre&s;pondent, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I had once a mind to have &s;pelled my name DILLEN, it being ea&s;ier to pronounce; and to make my brother do the &s;ame: for my great grandfather &s;pelled it &s;o, and my great great grandfather DILL: but, con&s;idering that my name and my father's had been &s;o often printed DILLENIUS, I have left it as it is."</Q></NOTE> was born at <HI>Darm&s;tadt,</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> in the year 168<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. It appears that he had his education, prin|cipally at the univer&s;ity of <HI>Gie&s;&s;en,</HI> a city of <HI>Upper He&s;&s;e;</HI> and where, probably, his fa|mily had con&s;iderable intere&s;t and con|nexions; &s;ince I find two of his contempo|raries of the &s;ame name, of whom, one was
<PB N="155" REF="162">
a profe&s;&s;or of medicine, and dean of the fa|culty of phy&s;ic at that place; and the other, <HI>Poliater,</HI> or public phy&s;ician; an office, I believe, not uncommon in <HI>Germany,</HI> though unknown here; and which DILLENIUS him&s;elf held in the &s;ame city. He was very early made a member of the <HI>Academia Cu|rio&s;orum Germaniae.</HI> He communicated &s;e|veral papers to that &s;ociety, which were publi&s;hed in their <HI>Mi&s;cellanea Curio&s;a.</HI> The earlie&s;t, that I find, was a Di&s;&s;ertation, in the <HI>Third Century of Ob&s;ervations,</HI> about the year 1715, concerning the plants of <HI>Ame|rica</HI> which are naturalized in <HI>Europe.</HI> This is a &s;ubject which might again be taken up by a &s;kilful hand, to great advantage. The re&s;ult of ob&s;ervation, and communication on this matter, would unque&s;tionably prove, that a far greater number of plants than we are aware of, which are now thought to be indigenous in <HI>Europe,</HI> were of exotic origin. Be&s;ides the mo&s;t obvious method, from the garden to the dunghill, and from thence to the field, among&s;t a variety of other cau&s;es, the importation of grain has introduced a great number: the package of merchan|di&s;e,
<PB N="156" REF="163">
and the clearing out of &s;hips, have been the means of di&s;per&s;ing many. The <HI>Engli&s;h Flora,</HI> as it now &s;tands, cannot con|tain fewer, perhaps, than &s;ixty <HI>acknowledged</HI> &s;pecies; and a critical examination would probably inve&s;tigate a much greater num|ber.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Fourth Century</HI> of the &s;ame work, we find a critical di&s;&s;ertation on the <HI>(Cahve)</HI> coffee of the <HI>Arabians:</HI> and on <HI>European</HI> coffee, or &s;uch as may be prepared from grain or pul&s;e. DILLENIUS gives the re|&s;ult of his own preparations made with pea&s;e, beans, and kidney beans; but &s;ays, that from <HI>rye</HI> comes the neare&s;t to true coffee, and was with difficulty di&s;tingui&s;hed from it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Sixth Century,</HI> he has de&s;cribed and figured four &s;pecies of dubious plants; three of the <HI>Spergula</HI> genus, now <HI>Arenariae;</HI> and a <HI>Veronica.</HI></P>
<P>In the Appendix to this <HI>Century,</HI> DIL|LENIUS gave the fir&s;t &s;pecimen of his ac|curate examination of &s;ome plants of the <HI>Cryptogamous</HI> cla&s;s; which he afterwards pur&s;ued &s;o greatly to the improvement of
<PB N="157" REF="164">
botany. In this paper, DILLENIUS treats on the propagation of plants in general; but more particularly on that of the <HI>Ferns,</HI> or <HI>capillary</HI> plants; and of the <HI>Mo&s;&s;es,</HI> which had hitherto been con&s;idered as de&s;titute of flower and &s;eed. He de&s;cribes the flowers of that genus, which he afterwards called <HI>Lichena&s;trum,</HI> and which was named by MI|CHELI, <HI>Jungermannia.</HI> He delineates two of the <HI>Chara</HI> genus; &s;ome of the <HI>Confervae;</HI> and &s;everal of the more perfect plants, parti|cularly the <HI>Chondrilla.</HI> He fixed the genus <HI>Radiola; Corrigiola,</HI> &amp;c. and particularly the <HI>Centunculus;</HI> and <HI>Cameraria,</HI> which was afterwards called <HI>Montia.</HI> To the&s;e he &s;ub|joins many curious ob&s;ervations on the u&s;e of the <HI>petals</HI> and <HI>&s;tamina,</HI> all tending to confirm the doctrine of the <HI>&s;exes</HI> of plants; ob&s;erva|tions on the root of the <HI>Equi&s;etum;</HI> on the du&s;t of the <HI>Antherae,</HI> and on the different &s;hape of that in the <HI>Orchis,</HI> which he &s;ays is conical; and of that in the <HI>Ophrys,</HI> which is round.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Ninth Century</HI> of the &s;ame work, he relates an experiment he made concern|ing
<PB N="158" REF="165">
the Opium which he prepared him&s;elf, from the poppy of <HI>European</HI> growth.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Eighth Century,</HI> he appears as a zoologi&s;t, in a paper on <HI>Leeches;</HI> and de|&s;cribes two &s;pecies of the <HI>Papilio</HI> genus.</P>
<P>In 1719, he publi&s;hed his "Catalogue of Plants growing in the neighbourhood of <HI>Gie&s;&s;en;</HI>" a work which e&s;tabli&s;hed his character as one of the mo&s;t accurate botani&s;ts of the age. It bears the follow|ing title:</P>

<P>It is dedicated to the heads of the uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Gie&s;&s;en;</HI> and contains the plants
<PB N="159" REF="166">
of the neighbourhood, confined to a circuit of not more than a <HI>German</HI> mile and a half. Of this tract he has given a map in his book.</P>
<P>The author has prefixed "A Critical Ex|amination of the Methods of arranging Plants," publi&s;hed by RAY and KNAUT, who had founded their cla&s;&s;ical di&s;tinctions on the <HI>fruit;</HI> and of tho&s;e publi&s;hed by RI|VINUS, and TOURNEFORT, founded on the <HI>flower.</HI> In the end, he gave the preference to RAY's &s;y&s;tem, and adhered to it through|out his life. His critici&s;m on RIVINUS brought upon him the re&s;entment of the author, at that time far advanced in years, who an&s;wered his objections. DILLENIUS had written in a &s;tile that was but too re|prehen&s;ible; and can only be excu&s;ed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as natural to the warmth of a young author; though it has been gene|rally acknowledged, that he had the advan|tage in the argument.</P>
<P>Nothing can &s;hew the early &s;kill and in|defatigable indu&s;try of DILLENIUS more &s;trongly, than his being able to produce &s;o great a number of plants in &s;o &s;mall a tract.
<PB N="160" REF="167">
He has not enumerated fewer than 980 &s;pecies, of what were then called the more perfect plants; that is, exclu&s;ive of the <HI>Mu&s;hroom</HI> cla&s;s, and all the <HI>Mo&s;&s;es.</HI> DIL|LENIUS entered minutely into the examina|tion of this cla&s;s; and, by his diligence and di&s;coveries, extended the bounds of that field, which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botani&s;ts had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated before him. More had been done in <HI>England</HI> in this way than in any other nation. The <HI>Pinax</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;par</HI> BAUHINE contains but fifty &s;pecies; &s;o little had the <HI>Mu&s;ci</HI> been regarded before. The fir&s;t edition of RAY's <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> printed in 1690, not more than about eighty kinds; whereas by the inve&s;tigations of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botani&s;ts, particularly of DOODY, SHERARD, VERNON, LLHWYD, ROBIN|SON, PETIVER, BOBART, and others, this order was &s;o far augmented in the &s;econd edition of the &s;ame work, in 1696, as to contain upwards of 170 &s;pecies.</P>
<P>DILLENIUS was, however, the fir&s;t wri|ter who examined them with a view to ge|nerical characters, and divided the <HI>Mo&s;&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;hrooms,</HI> each into &s;eparate <HI>genera.</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="168">
It is in this book that we fir&s;t meet with <HI>Bryum, Hypnum, Mnium, Sphagnum, Liche|noides,</HI> and <HI>Lichena&s;trum,</HI> as generical names. The four fir&s;t of the&s;e, were terms in u&s;e with the <HI>Patres Botanici,</HI> although neglected by the re&s;torers of the &s;cience, who had ranked all under the general term <HI>Mu&s;cus;</HI> except the <HI>Lichen, Lycopodium,</HI> and <HI>Polytri|chum.</HI> To demon&s;trate his accuracy and diligence, it may be ob&s;erved, that, in the environs of <HI>Gie&s;&s;en</HI> alone, DILLENIUS di&s;|covered more than 200 &s;pecies of <HI>Mo&s;&s;es,</HI> of which 140 were new: of the <HI>Mu&s;hroom</HI> order he enumerates 160, of which up|wards of 90 were &s;uch as he judged had not been noticed by any author before. The plants in this catalogue are di&s;po&s;ed in the order of flowering, throughout all the year. The places of growth are &s;ub|joined, with critical ob&s;ervations on many of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The Appendix contains a li&s;t of twenty plants, additional to tho&s;e of the Cata|logue, di&s;covered in the immediate environs of <HI>Gie&s;&s;en;</HI> and an enumeration of upwards of 100 &s;pecies, ob&s;erved by the author, be|yond
<PB N="162" REF="169">
the bounds circum&s;cribed in the Ca|talogue. This renders the book, in a great mea&s;ure, a <HI>Flora</HI> of the plants of <HI>He&s;&s;e.</HI> Then follows a de&s;cription of the <HI>new</HI> &s;pe|cies of the Catalogue. The&s;e are &s;ucceeded by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his new <HI>genera</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;&s;es, Fungi,</HI> and a variety of others, a|mounting to near 100, of which &s;ome of former authors are here only amended; but the far greater part are of his own con|&s;tructing, and entirely new; and the parts of fructification &s;eparately delineated, in 16 copper-plates. This part of his work has been of great authority with &s;ucceeding writers; and many of the&s;e characters have &s;tood the te&s;t of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The merit of this work fixed the cha|racter of the author, as a perfectly &s;cienti|fic botani&s;t, and attracted the notice of all the eminent profe&s;&s;ors, and admirers of the &s;cience: among others, that of Mr. <HI>William,</HI> afterwards Dr. SHERARD, to whom we owe that DILLENIUS was brought to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and in the end fixed in the profe&s;&s;or|&s;hip at <HI>Oxford.</HI> SHERARD was, at that time, among the few who patronized and cultivated the &s;cience in <HI>England.</HI> He was
<PB N="163" REF="170">
lately returned from <HI>Smyrna;</HI> and having regretted the neglect of the <HI>Cryptogamia</HI> cla&s;s, he was &s;o enamoured with the di&s;co|veries of DILLENIUS in that branch, that he entered into corre&s;pondence with him, and procured &s;pecimens from him, and afterwards brought him to <HI>England.</HI> No man was more clo&s;ely devoted to a favourite mu&s;e than DILLENIUS was to <HI>Flora;</HI> and, after his arrival in <HI>England,</HI> he pur&s;ued his &s;tudy with uncommon ardour, and corre|&s;ponding diligence. The acqui&s;ition of &s;o able a man, was probably an additional mo|tive with the Con&s;ul, to attempt the revi|val of botany in the univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>DILLENIUS came into <HI>England</HI> in Au|gu&s;t 1721, where he had not long re&s;ided before he undertook a work that was much de&s;ired; that of publi&s;hing a new edition of the <HI>Synop&s;is Stirpium Britannicarum</HI> of RAY. It had been la&s;t printed in 1696, and was become &s;carce. DILLENIUS hav|ing firmly attached him&s;elf to RAY's &s;y&s;|tem, and even improved it in &s;ome parts (though he intimates in one of his letters to a friend, that he was not allowed to

<P>In the year 1727, Dr. THRELKELD pub|li&s;hed his <HI>Synop&s;is Stirpium Hibernicarum,</HI> in which he had introduced &s;ome &s;evere &s;trictures on DILLENIUS, principally level|led at the introduction of his new generical names. He al&s;o inveighs again&s;t him for unnece&s;&s;arily multiplying the &s;pecies of
<PB N="166" REF="173">
plants. See the articles, <HI>Anagallis aquatica, Dens Leonis, Lichenoides, Mu&s;cus trichoides, Stellaria,</HI> &amp;c. DILLENIUS, though di&s;|plea&s;ed with the har&s;h and coar&s;e language of THRELKELD's critici&s;ms, had temper enough to forbear entering into any con|trover&s;y on this occa&s;ion. He probably did not think THRELKELD's objections of any force &s;ufficient to influence men of judg|ment in the &s;cience, as the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> botani&s;t had but little regarded any true principles of generical di&s;tinction. In a letter he wrote &s;oon after the publication of the <HI>Iri&s;h Flora,</HI> after complaining of the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of THRELKELD's cen&s;ures, he informs his corre&s;pondent that there was but one plant recited in the book, which was not known before as a native of <HI>Ireland.</HI> This, he adds, is the <HI>P&s;eudo-&s;tachys Alpina</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;par</HI> BAUHINE (<HI>Stachys Alpina</HI> Lin.); and this he had in&s;erted on the authority of Mr. HEATON's manu&s;cript.</P>
<P>About this time he had it in contempla|tion, to publi&s;h a new edition of the <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> with the addition of the old <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> names;
<PB N="167" REF="174">
and the times of flowering&mdash;an article neg|lected in the former editions. This de&s;ign was laid a&s;ide, and an <HI>Appendix</HI> intended, for which ample materials were in hand, received from different quarters, particularly from Dr. RICHARDSON, of <HI>North Bierly,</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire;</HI> and from Mr. BREWER, who had re&s;ided two &s;ea&s;ons at <HI>Bangor,</HI> purpo&s;ely to inve&s;tigate, and collect the plants of <HI>Snow|don,</HI> and the neighbouring parts. BREWER was very &s;ucce&s;sful in his re&s;earches, and &s;ent at different times great numbers of &s;carce plants to DILLENIUS. This <HI>Ap|pendix</HI> al&s;o mi&s;carried.

<P>Whatever might be the preci&s;e nature of his engagement with the <HI>Con&s;ul,</HI> it appears that DILLENIUS, being doubtful of the &s;ucce&s;s of the <HI>Oxford</HI> &s;cheme, had formed a de&s;ign of re&s;iding &s;ome time,

<HEAD>DILLENIUS.</HEAD>
<P>DILLENIUS was now arrived at that &s;ituation, which had probably been the main object of his wi&s;hes; and which he con&s;idered equally as the completion of his hopes, the a&s;ylum again&s;t future di&s;ap|pointments, and the field of all that grati|fication, for which his ta&s;te and pur&s;uits prompted him to wi&s;h, and qualified him to enjoy. Add to all this, he was placed in the &s;ociety of the learned, in the com|plete&s;t &s;en&s;e of that word, and at the foun|tain of every information, which the &s;tores of both antient and modern erudition could di&s;play, to an inqui&s;itive mind.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="178">
The plan of the <HI>Hortus Elthamen&s;is</HI> had been laid &s;o early as the year 1724, imme|diately after publi&s;hing the <HI>Synop&s;is;</HI> and &s;ome of the plants were figured and de&s;cribed be|fore Dr. SHERARD's death. The work was now carried on with vigour, and was print|ed in 1732, under the following title:</P>
<P>"HORTUS ELTHAMENSIS, <HI>&s;eu Planta|rum rariorum quas in Horto &s;uo Elthami in Cantio coluit Vir ornati&s;&s;imus et prae&s;tanti&s;&s;i|mus Jacobus</HI> SHERARD, <HI>M.D. Soc. Reg. et Coll.

Auctore Jo|hanne Jacobo</HI> DILLENIO, <HI>M.D.</HI>" <HI>Lond. Fol.</HI> pp. 437. <HI>Tab.</HI> 324.</P>
<P>In this elegant and elaborate work, of which LINNAEUS &s;ays, "<HI>e&s;t opus botanicum quo ab&s;olutius mundum non vidit,</HI>" are de|&s;cribed and figured, with the mo&s;t circum|&s;tantial accuracy, 417 plants, all drawn and etched with his own hand, con&s;i&s;ting principally of &s;uch exotics as were then rare, or had been but lately introduced into <HI>Eng|land.</HI> A few of the more rare <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and
<PB N="172" REF="179">
<HI>Welch</HI> plants were included. They are di&s;|po&s;ed in the alphabetical order. The fi|gures are of the natural &s;ize as much as may be. The <HI>&s;ynonyma</HI> of former authors are quoted and accompanied by copious critical examinations and ob&s;ervations, the better to a&s;certain the &s;pecies. Several new <HI>genera</HI> are e&s;tabli&s;hed, many of the new <HI>Gerania</HI> are figured, and a very copious hi&s;tory of the <HI>genus Me&s;embryanthemum</HI> given; with a &s;ynoptical view of all the &s;pecies, of which fifty-four are de&s;cribed and figured in this work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The plates of the <HI>Hortus Elthamen&s;is</HI> were after|wards &s;old to a <HI>Dutch</HI> book&s;eller; who ca&s;t off an impre&s;|&s;ion, accompanied with the denominations only of the &s;pecies. This was done at <HI>Leyden</HI> in 1774; and many copies have found their way into this kingdom.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We find by the li&s;t of graduates, that DILLENIUS was admitted to the degree of Doctor of Phy&s;ic in <HI>St. John's College,</HI> April 3, 1735.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1736, LINNAEUS vi&s;it|ed the Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and, although DILLENIUS did not reli&s;h the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem, about that time fir&s;t divulged, yet LIN|NAEUS returned with the highe&s;t opinion of
<PB N="173" REF="180">
his merit; and, as I have ob&s;erved on an|other occa&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the&s;e terms: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>In Anglia nullus e&s;t qui genera cu|rat vel intelligat praeterquam</HI> DILLENIUS."</Q></P>
<P>LINNAEUS, after this time, corre&s;ponded with him, &s;ent him his <HI>Flora Lapponica,</HI> and dedicated to him the <HI>Critica Botanica.</HI> On which occa&s;ion the Profe&s;&s;or &s;ent his acknowledgments in the following terms, in a letter, dated Aug. 18, 1737: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Vidi, accepi et legi Floram tuam Lapponicam multa cum voluptate; utinam plures i&s;tiu&s;modi nobis pro&s;tarent tali &s;tudio, et cura elaboratae, in hac te virum prae&s;titi&s;ti.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>During this period, DILLENIUS held fre|quent corre&s;pondence and communication with HALLER, whom he e&s;teemed, proba|bly the more, on account of the affinity of his &s;y&s;tem with that of RAY, which he had him&s;elf adopted. It appears, that he con|&s;idered HALLER as almo&s;t the only man qualified to carry on the <HI>Pinax,</HI> and wi&s;hed him to have been his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>About this time, he was employed with Dr. SHAW, in reducing to order and a&s;cer|taining, that learned traveller's collection of
<PB N="174" REF="181">
Oriental plants. As they were all dried &s;pe|cimens, and the collection exten&s;ive, con|&s;i&s;ting of 640 &s;pecies, it required the aid of an able hand to di&s;tingui&s;h and apply &s;yno|nyms to &s;o con&s;iderable a number. This catalogue, therefore, which is annexed, with the engravings of a few of the plants, to the fir&s;t edition of Dr. SHAW's elaborate work, may be con&s;idered eventually, as the work of the botanical Profe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>After the completion of the <HI>Hortus El|thamen&s;is,</HI> he pur&s;ued his "Hi&s;tory of Mo&s;&s;es" with great diligence. It has been ob&s;erved before, that he had extended his re&s;earches into this part of nature, much further than any preceding botani&s;t, having been the fir&s;t di&s;coverer of a great number of &s;pecies, and having &s;eparated tho&s;e here|tofore de&s;cribed together by the general term <HI>Mu&s;cus,</HI> into &s;everal <HI>genera,</HI> under the names of <HI>Sphagnum, Fontinalis, Bryum,</HI> and <HI>Hypnum;</HI> taking his di&s;tinctions, as well from the <HI>habit</HI> of the plant, (to which the accurate HALLER thought he paid too much regard,) as from the figure and &s;ituation of that part of the &s;ructification which is
<PB N="175" REF="182">
now con&s;idered as the <HI>cap&s;ule.</HI> By means of the excellent botanical library of the SHERARDS, and free acce&s;s to their ample <HI>Herbarium,</HI> and that of Mr. DU BOIS, who had, with Mr. DOODY and &s;everal others, &s;ignalized them&s;elves by their di&s;coveries this way &s;ome years before, DILLENIUS enjoyed advantages which perhaps no other &s;ituation could have afforded. Be&s;ides which, to give him&s;elf all further opportu|nities that <HI>Britain</HI> allowed of making di&s;|coveries in this department, he took a jour|ney him&s;elf into <HI>Wales,</HI> in the &s;ummer of 1726. In this excur&s;ion he was attended by <HI>Samuel</HI> BREWER. They examined <HI>Cader Idris,</HI> and took up their re&s;idence at <HI>Ban|gor;</HI> &s;earched <HI>Snowdon, Glyder,</HI> the <HI>I&s;le of Angle&s;ea;</HI> and vi&s;ited the <HI>I&s;te of Man.</HI> Mr. GREEN, a clergyman of tho&s;e parts, was u&s;eful in directing their re&s;earches, and in a&s;&s;i&s;ting DILLENIUS in the <HI>Welch</HI> names of places, and of plants. The Rev. <HI>Little|ton</HI> BROWN, M.A. Fellow of the Royal Society, is al&s;o commemorated, as having communicated many &s;pecimens of the <HI>Cryp|togamous</HI> tribe to our author, collected by
<PB N="176" REF="183">
him in <HI>Wales, Shrop&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Hereford&s;hire;</HI> and thus, by the communications of the&s;e, and many other friends, who&s;e aid he has gratefully acknowledged<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The names of &s;everal foreigners appear in this li&s;t; Dr. AMMAN, of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at <HI>Peter&s;burgh; Olaus</HI> CELSIUS, Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity at <HI>Up&s;al;</HI> Dr. <HI>J.

In 1741 it was publi&s;hed from the <HI>Sheldon</HI> pre&s;s, under the following title:</P>

<P>All the &s;ubjects of this volume were drawn, and engraved with his own hand. It comprehends all tho&s;e plants which
<PB N="177" REF="184">
come under the name of <HI>Mu&s;ci</HI> and <HI>Algae</HI> in the <HI>Cryptogamia</HI> cla&s;s of the &s;exual &s;y&s;|tem, except the <HI>Fucu&s;es,</HI> &s;ome of the <HI>Ulvae, Confervae,</HI> and a very few others. The au|thor's method is throughout as follows; at the head of each genus he gives the ety|mology of the name; his rea&s;ons for adopt|ing that name, and applying it to the &s;ub|ject; then the definition of his genus, fol|lowed by the &s;ubordinate di&s;tinctions for the arrangement of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>In treating on each &s;pecies, he gives, 1. A new &s;pecific character, in terms intended to di&s;tingui&s;h it from others of the &s;ame genus, or &s;ubdivi&s;ion. 2. The de&s;cription of the &s;pecies at length; di&s;tingui&s;hing al&s;o, with great care, the &s;everal varieties; and referring each to the &s;everal figures on his plates. 3.

A &s;ummary view of the u&s;es of &s;everal kinds appears in the preface; but in the body of the work, DILLENIUS has, with great dili|gence, collected numerous authorities on the&s;e heads; which &s;ufficiently evince, that this almo&s;t unnoticed tribe of vegetables hold a more con&s;iderable importance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numerous proofs of the truth of this ob&s;ervation oc|cur in the various writings of modern botani&s;ts.

The merit of Dr. RICHARD|SON, both from his undoubted &s;kill in the &s;ci|ence, and his well known patronage of tho&s;e who cheri&s;hed it, demand a more particular commemoration than I am able to give;
<PB N="186" REF="193">
&s;ince I am unacquainted with any further circum&s;tances relating to him, than that he was educated a phy&s;ician, and lived at <HI>North Bierly,</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire.</HI> There he re&s;ided upon his own e&s;tate, which was ample enough to render the practice of phy&s;ic totally unne|ce&s;&s;ary to his well-being, from any lucra|tive views. He had travelled into various parts of <HI>England,</HI> for the inve&s;tigation of plants, and had been &s;ucce&s;sful in his tour into <HI>Wales,</HI> having more e&s;pecially made di&s;coveries in the <HI>Cryptogamia</HI> cla&s;s. His garden was well &s;tored with exotics, and with a curious collection of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plants. He was happily &s;ituated to favour his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the latter, with which his &s;tore was repleni&s;hed from time to time by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Samuel</HI> BREWER, and <HI>Thomas</HI> KNOWLTON, both in&s;tances of &s;trong at|tachment to botanical pur&s;uits, and both re&s;ident in the &s;ame county.</P>
<P>Dr. RICHARDSON lived in intimacy and corre&s;pondence with Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, Dr. DILLENIUS, and other celebrated botani&s;ts of his time. I do not find that he pub|li&s;hed on his favourite amu&s;ement; but his

<P>I reluctantly pa&s;s over the names of many others, mentioned in the <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> who&s;e &s;ervices, although they were not writers on the &s;ubject, might ju&s;tly call for re&s;pectful notice: but, not being able to produce any &s;atisfactory or intere&s;ting anecdotes relating to them, I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with refer|ring the reader to a li&s;t of them, collected with no &s;mall pains, by the pre&s;ent Profe&s;|&s;or of Botany at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and publi&s;hed in the Preface to his <HI>Plantae Cantabrigien|&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Having however mentioned the name of <HI>Samuel</HI> BREWER, his connection with DIL|LENIUS will not allow me to refu&s;e a pro|per tribute to his memory; &s;ince his pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botany, and his &s;kill and a&s;&s;i|duity, enabled him to afford &s;ingular a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to the Profe&s;&s;or, particularly in the &s;ubjects for his "Hi&s;tory of <HI>Mo&s;&s;es;</HI>" as in
<PB N="189" REF="196">
&s;ome in&s;tances he had done in the <HI>Synop|&s;is,</HI> for the plants of <HI>Mendip</HI> and <HI>Chedder Rocks.</HI></P>
<P>He was originally of <HI>Trowbridge,</HI> in <HI>Wilts,</HI> in which county he had a &s;mall e&s;tate. He was engaged at one time in the woollen manufactory of that place; but, I believe, proved un&s;ucce&s;sful in bu&s;ine&s;s. He attended DILLENIUS into <HI>Wales, An|gle&s;ey,</HI> and the <HI>I&s;le of Man,</HI> in the &s;ummer of 1726; and afterwards remained the win|ter, and the greater part of the next year, in that country; making his re&s;idence at <HI>Bangor,</HI> and taking his excur&s;ions to <HI>Snow|don</HI> and el&s;ewhere, often accompanied by the Rev. Mr. GREEN, and Mr. <HI>William</HI> JONES. While in <HI>Wales,</HI> it was intended that he &s;hould have gone over to <HI>Ireland,</HI> to make a botanical tour through that kingdom; but that expedition never took place. So long a re&s;idence gave him an op|portunity not only of &s;eeing the beauties of &s;ummer plants, but of collecting the <HI>Cryp|togamia</HI> in winter, when they flouri&s;h mo&s;t. Here he received in&s;tructions from the Pro|fe&s;&s;or, collected &s;pecimens of every thing
<PB N="190" REF="197">
rare, or unknown to him before, and &s;ent them to DILLENIUS, to determine the &s;pe|cies, and fix the names. I have &s;een a ca|talogue of more than two hundred plants, many of which were ill a&s;certained before, all &s;ent at one time, with the references to the <HI>Synop&s;is</HI> affixed by DILLENIUS.

<P>In 1728, Mr. BREWER went into <HI>York|&s;hire,</HI> and re&s;ided, I believe, the remainder of his days at <HI>Bradford,</HI> in that county, in the neighbourhood of Dr. RICHARDSON, by who&s;e beneficence he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in various ways. After his retirement into <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> he meditated, and nearly fini&s;hed, a work which was to have borne the title of "The Botanical Guide;" but it never ap|peared. I cannot determine the time of his decea&s;e, but am a&s;&s;ured he was living in the year 1742.</P>

<P><HI>IRELAND</HI> has been &s;o little di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for the production of writers on the &s;ubject of the&s;e &s;ketches, that it has not been in my power, till this late period, to introduce to the reader's notice, any pro|fe&s;&s;ed work on the <HI>Flora</HI> of that kingdom.

But the &s;econd part of the work, in which the author intended to have given the Vegeta|bles, was never publi&s;hed; if indeed it was ever written.</P>
<P>There is a Mr. <HI>Zanche</HI> SILLIARD, an apothecary of <HI>Dublin,</HI> mentioned by PAR|KINSON, who &s;eems to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome botanical knowledge. But the earlie&s;t in|telligence that I can find of any real bota|ni&s;t, a native of <HI>Ireland,</HI> is of a Mr. HEA|TON, a divine, who lived at <HI>Dublin.</HI> I cannot collect any anecdotes of him; but I find his name attached, as the fir&s;t di&s;co|verer, to many plants in HOW's <HI>Phytologia,</HI> and to &s;ome in MERRETT's <HI>Pinax;</HI> and, from the number and rarity of the &s;ubjects recorded, he mu&s;t have been a per&s;on of con&s;iderable knowledge in his way. It appears from the &s;ame authorities, that he had been much in <HI>England,</HI> having pointed out the natural places of many rare plants
<PB N="195" REF="202">
of this country. He is thought to have left a manu&s;cript on the &s;ubject, which it is conjectured was written about the year 1641, and from which THRELKELD took the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> names of plants, who &s;ays, they were much more copious and exact than he could collect from any living authority. In the number of plants, it greatly exceeds any li&s;t we have extant of the old <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> names, or of tho&s;e in the <HI>Er&s;e</HI> tongue, among the <HI>Highlanders.</HI></P>
<P>Towards the latter end of the century, &s;ome information was received relating to the natural hi&s;tory of <HI>Ireland,</HI> from the tour of Dr. LLHWYD, as recorded in the <HI>Philo|&s;ophical Tran&s;actions;</HI> and Dr. <HI>William</HI> SHE|RARD, on his vi&s;its to Sir <HI>Arthur</HI> RAW|DON, at <HI>Moyra,</HI> noticed many of the rare plants of that region.</P>
<P>Soon after this time, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Society</HI> at <HI>Dublin</HI> contri|buted to advance, among other &s;ciences, that of natural hi&s;tory; and, of tho&s;e who exerted them&s;elves to promote the&s;e pur|&s;uits, were the two brothers, Dr. <HI>Wil|liam</HI> and Dr. <HI>Thomas</HI> MOLYNEUX. Their

papers are numerous, and are extant in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Thomas</HI> MOLYNEUX was profe&s;&s;or of phy&s;ic in the univer&s;ity of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and phy|&s;ician to the &s;tate, and to the army.

<P>He communicated his papers to Dr. THRELKELD, who incorporated &s;ome of them into the body of his <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> and placed the remainder at the end. Of Dr. THRELKELD I now proceed to give &s;ome account.</P>

<P><HI>Caleb</HI> THRELKELD, the author of the fir&s;t treati&s;e on the plants of <HI>Ireland,</HI> was born the 31&s;t of May, 1676, at <HI>Keiberg,</HI> in the pari&s;h of <HI>Kirko&s;wald,</HI> in <HI>Cumberland.</HI> In the year 1698, he commenced ma&s;ter of arts in the univer&s;ity of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and &s;oon after &s;ettled at <HI>Low Huddle&s;ceugh,</HI> near the place of his birth, in the character of a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter. He had acquired a
<PB N="197" REF="204">
ta&s;te for botany and phy&s;ic during his re|&s;idence at <HI>Gla&s;gow;</HI> and continued to make a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the&s;e &s;tudies, in|&s;omuch, that, in 1712, he took a doctor's degree in phy&s;ic at <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and the next &s;pring, having a &s;traight income, and a large family, he removed to <HI>Dublin,</HI> and &s;ettled there in the united character of the divine, and phy&s;ician. Finding him&s;elf like|ly to &s;ucceed, in little more than a year, he &s;ent for his family, con&s;i&s;ting of a wife, three &s;ons, and three daughters. His prac|tice as a phy&s;ician, &s;oon increa&s;ed, &s;o far as to enable him to drop his other character entirely, and devote him&s;elf wholly to phy|&s;ic. In 1727, he publi&s;hed his "SYNOPSIS STIRPIUM HIBERNICARUM;" and died, after a &s;hort &s;ickne&s;s, of a violent fever, at his hou&s;e in <HI>Mark's Alley, Frances Street,</HI> April 28, 1728; and was buried in the new burial ground belonging to <HI>St. Patrick's,</HI> near <HI>Cavan Street;</HI> to which place his ob|&s;equies were attended by a &s;et of children, educated by a &s;ociety of gentlemen, to which in&s;titution he had acted as phy&s;ician.

erudition in the &s;cience, enumerates all the plants he had ob&s;erved in the environs of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and of all &s;uch as he had gained authentic intelligence, from other parts of the kingdom.

<HEAD>MARTYN.</HEAD>
<P>AT the dawn of learning, the &s;eeds of botany had been fir&s;t &s;own in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> by Dr. TURNER, at <HI>Cambridge.</HI> They can &s;carcely, however, be &s;aid to have ger|minated, until a century afterwards, under the fo&s;tering care of Mr. RAY. By his cultivation, they took root, although not invigorated by public &s;upport. In the mean time, through the munificence of the Earl of DANBY, <HI>Oxford</HI> experienced the benefit of a public in&s;titution in aid of this &s;cience, and botany flouri&s;hed under the care of MO|RISON.
<PB N="206" REF="213">
After his time, to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of DILLENIUS, it langui&s;hed; no pub|lication marked its progre&s;s; and its hi&s;tory at <HI>Oxford</HI> is void of intere&s;ting facts. Nearly the &s;ame languor prevailed after the time of Mr. RAY at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and botany attained no &s;trength till the time of Dr. MARTYN, who, under the patronage of the univer&s;ity, gave the fir&s;t public lecture in that depart|ment, in the year 1727.</P>
<P>Of this learned botani&s;t, I am now, in the order of time, to pre&s;ent the reader with &s;ome account: and here I find my&s;elf agree|ably anticipated by the relation of his life and writings, prefixed to his "Di&s;&s;ertations on the Aeneids of VIRGIL," printed in 1770, 12^o, and drawn up by his mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;on, and &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip; with who&s;e friend&s;hip and corre&s;pondence, I have on this occa&s;ion a &s;incere plea&s;ure in ac|knowledging, I have long been honoured. Hence I &s;hall briefly recite from the&s;e anec|dotes, only the leading circum&s;tances in the life of Dr. MARTYN, as connected with his profe&s;&s;orial character; and conclude with a &s;hort account of his botanical writings.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="214">
<HI>John</HI> MARTYN was born in the city of <HI>London,</HI> Sept. 12, 1699, and was de&s;igned by his father for the profe&s;&s;ion of a mer|chant; but his early and &s;trong propen&s;ity to learning and &s;cience, in the end over-ruled that de&s;ign. He had from his youth an attachment to botany; and this ta&s;te was further excited by his acquaintance with Mr. WILMER, afterwards demon&s;trator at <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> Garden; and confirmed by an inti|macy with, and the countenance of, Dr. SHERARD, in the year 1719. In the year 1720, he tran&s;lated from the <HI>French,</HI> Dr. TOURNEFORT's "Hi&s;tory of the Plants growing about <HI>Paris;</HI>" and having pro|jected a like catalogue of the plants about <HI>London,</HI> he collected, with unwearied dili|gence, the native plants of the environs; making for this purpo&s;e &s;ometimes very ex|ten&s;ive excur&s;ions, and almo&s;t ever on foot. He had once conceived a &s;cheme for form|ing a method from the <HI>Seed-leaves,</HI> and had &s;own a great number of &s;eeds in order to ob&s;erve the difference between them. He early became acquainted with DILLENIUS, and co-operated with him in forming a &s;o|ciety
<PB N="208" REF="215">
of botani&s;ts, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;even|teen members. This &s;ociety kept together till the year 1726. He continued, during the years 1723 and 1724, to make his excur|&s;ions in &s;earch of plants more frequent, and extended them farther, into <HI>Middle&s;ex, Sur|rey, E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and <HI>Kent.</HI> At the &s;ame time he &s;tudied In&s;ects, continued his ob&s;ervations on the Seed-leaves, and made many others on the Sexes of Plants. He had, &s;everal years before this time, tran&s;lated from the <HI>Latin,</HI> an ode on that &s;ubject, pre&s;ented to CAMERARIUS, and printed in that Author's epi&s;tle <HI>De Sexu Plantarum.</HI> The tran&s;lation may be &s;een in BLAIR's "Botanic E&s;&s;ays."</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1724, he travelled into <HI>Wales,</HI> by <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> returning by <HI>Hereford, Worce&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Oxford;</HI> by which he extended the objects of his &s;tudies, and augmented his collection of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plants; in&s;omuch, that at length it comprehended 1400 &s;pecimens.</P>
<P>In 1725 and 1726, he read lectures in botany in <HI>London,</HI> and was recommended by Dr. SHERARD and Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE to exerci&s;e the &s;ame function at <HI>Cambridge;</HI>
<PB N="209" REF="216">
where, on the death of BRADLEY, he was cho&s;en Profe&s;&s;or of Botany; and continued to give lectures for &s;everal years, until the want of a garden, and his long ab&s;ence from the bu&s;ine&s;s of phy&s;ic, which he had engaged in, rendered it incommodious to him.</P>
<P>In 1727, Dr. MARTYN was admitted a member of the Royal Society; and was &s;o active in the committee for regulating the library and mu&s;eum, in 1731, that he had his bond for annual payment cancelled by an order of council, as an acknowledgment of his &s;ervices.</P>
<P>In 1730, he was admitted of <HI>Emanuel</HI> College, with an intention to have pro|ceeded regularly with the degrees in phy&s;ic; but his marriage, and his attention to the practice of the profe&s;&s;ion, prevented him from fini&s;hing his de&s;ign. In the mean time, he read lectures in Botany and the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> both at <HI>Cambridge</HI> and in <HI>London,</HI> in the years 1730 and 1731. In the beginning of the year 1733, he was elected Profe&s;&s;or of Botany by the unani|mous voice of the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="217">
Dr. MARTYN had practi&s;ed phy&s;ic for three years in the city, but on account of an a&s;thmatic complaint, removed in the year 1730 to <HI>Chel&s;ea;</HI> where he continued the exerci&s;e of that pro&s;e&s;&s;ion, until his retire|ment to <HI>Streatham,</HI> in 1752. In 1761, he re&s;igned his profe&s;&s;or&s;hip; and &s;oon after, in gratitude for the favour of having cho&s;en him, and his &s;on after him, to this po&s;t, he pre&s;ented to the univer&s;ity his botanical li|brary, con&s;i&s;ting of upwards of 200 vo|lumes; his <HI>Hortus Siccus</HI> of Exotics, con|taining 2600 &s;pecimens; near 250 drawings of <HI>Fungi;</HI> his collection of Seeds, and Seed Ve&s;&s;els; and his <HI>Materia Medica.</HI></P>
<P>He removed to <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> about a year be|fore his death; which event took place on the 29th of January, 1768.</P>
<P>The Profe&s;&s;or was the author of the fol|lowing publications:</P>

All the plants of Mr. RAY's two <HI>Appendices,</HI> of 1663 and 1685, now become extremely rare, amount|ing to 84 &s;pecies, are in&s;erted in this ma|nual, which was printed for the u&s;e of his pupils, on his fir&s;t reading lectures at <HI>Cam|bridge.</HI> A &s;heet and an half of a new edition, containing more than 150 &s;pecies, not con|tained in RAY's Catalogue, was printed as part of a new edition; but it was not car|ried farther: the&s;e were, <HI>Submarine Plants, Fungu&s;es, Mo&s;&s;es, Capillaries, Apetalous</HI> and <HI>Juliferous Plants.</HI> And, as the genius of RAY &s;till continued to animate his &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors, the <HI>Cambridge Flora</HI> has &s;ince been much augmented and improved, not only by the &s;kill and a&s;&s;iduity of the pre&s;ent Profe&s;&s;or, and the labours of the late Mr. LYONS, but more recently &s;till, by the

The extraordinary expence of this work prevented its progre&s;s. The plates were mezzotinto, and printed in pro|per colours.

<P>In 1729, having entertained a de&s;ign of reading a cour&s;e of lectures at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he pub|li&s;hed "The fir&s;t Lecture of a Cour&s;e of Bo|tany, being an Introduction to the re&s;t." 8^o. 1729. pp. 24. tab. 84. It is an explana|tion of the technical terms of the &s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="220">
In the year 1720, Dr. MARTYN, as hath been ob&s;erved, had made a Tran&s;lation of TOURNEFORT's "Hi&s;tory of Plants about <HI>Paris;</HI>" and at the &s;ame time meditated a Catalogue of tho&s;e of the environs of <HI>London.</HI> The latter was never fini&s;hed; nor was the Tran&s;lation publi&s;hed, till twelve years afterwards, when it appeared under the following title: "TOURNEFORT's Hi&s;|tory of Plants growing about <HI>Paris,</HI> with their U&s;es in Phy&s;ic; and a Mechanical Account of the Operation of Medicines. Tran&s;lated into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with many Ad|ditions, and accommodated to the Plants growing in <HI>Great Britain.</HI>" In 2 vols. 8^o. 1732.</P>
<P>"The Six Alphabets" of TOURNEFORT are reduced into one; all the u&s;eful ob&s;er|vations, both from the edition which came out by the united care of SHERARD and BOERHAAVE, and from that which was publi&s;hed by <HI>Bernard de</HI> JUSSIEU, are ex|tracted. The Tran&s;lator added al&s;o the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> names, and the places where the plants grow in <HI>England.</HI> He di&s;po&s;ed the <HI>Mo&s;&s;es</HI> according to DILLENIUS's method;

This oc|ca&s;ioned the removal of it, in the <HI>Flora An|glica,</HI> to the cla&s;s <HI>Polygamia.</HI> But as it does not appear that the remaining &s;pecies of the <HI>Ilex</HI> are &s;ubject to the &s;ame change, the genus &s;tands in the works of LINNAEUS in the <HI>Tetrandrous</HI> cla&s;s as before.</P>
<P>It is not without the &s;tricte&s;t ju&s;tice that the term indefatigable is applied to this learned man. His avocations from bu&s;ine&s;s were wholly devoted to the cau&s;e of litera|ture, which he contributed to &s;erve in va|rious ways. The numerous works he was engaged in, and the variety of his manu&s;cript remains, amply te&s;tify this truth. At one time he was concerned in a periodical pa|per. He was a coadjutor with Mr. EAMES,
<PB N="216" REF="223">
in abridging the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions;</HI> and was employed in writing the fir&s;t three volumes of the "General Dictionary," in which the lives of BELLONIUS, BOCCONE, and BRUNSFELSIUS, were written by him. He tran&s;lated BOERHAAVE's "Treati&s;e on the Powers of Medicine;" HARRIS's "Treati&s;e on the Acute Di&s;ea&s;es of Infants;" and, jointly with Mr. CHAMBERS, gave, in 5 volumes in octavo, in 1742, a Tran&s;lation, or rather an "Abridgment of Philo&s;ophical Papers, from the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at <HI>Paris.</HI>"</P>
<P>Dr. MARTYN was the author of thir|teen papers, printed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</HI> His Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Geor|gics</HI> and <HI>Bucolics</HI> of VIRGIL, with his notes upon this his favourite poet, hath extended his fame among the learned of all nations. To the cla&s;&s;ical reader in general, they af|ford ample &s;atisfaction; but to tho&s;e who join to &s;uch elegant enjoyment, a knowledge of the learned Editor's favourite &s;cience, the&s;e volumes mu&s;t afford a gratification, which they will in vain &s;eek for el&s;ewhere. His great knowledge both of antient and mo|dern
<PB N="217" REF="224">
&s;cience, relating to plants, enabled him to appropriate the modern appellations, with a degree of judgment, that has been highly approved of by tho&s;e who know the difficulty of the undertaking, under that almo&s;t total want of &s;pecific di&s;tinction, which occurs in the writings of the an|cients.</P>
<P>In the year 1737, our Author entered into corre&s;pondence with LINNAEUS. It is one of tho&s;e notices that can only oc|cur to a lover of &s;imilar &s;tudies, that he was, if not the fir&s;t, at lea&s;t one of the earlie&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> writers, who announced the northern genius to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> reader. This was done by the Profe&s;&s;or's extract from the <HI>Flora Lapponica,</HI> printed in the edition of the <HI>Georgics</HI> in 1741. It was &s;ome years afterwards, before the &s;y&s;tem of the <HI>Swede</HI> made any progre&s;s in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only remark further, that be&s;ides the obligations which literature in general owes to this learned Profe&s;&s;or, that which I call more &s;trictly <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botany, received con&s;iderable augmentation from his labours; particularly from his methodizing "The

<P>ALTHOUGH the ingenious author, whom I commemorate in this chap|ter, does not &s;trictly rank among the im|provers of indigenous botany; yet I cannot pa&s;s over in &s;ilence, a man, to whom the &s;cience owes one of its mo&s;t elegant, and &s;uperb productions. Mr. <HI>Mark</HI> CATESBY was, I believe, one of tho&s;e men, whom a pa&s;&s;ion for natural hi&s;tory very early al|lured from the intere&s;ting pur&s;uits of life; and it led him at length to cro&s;s the <HI>Atlan|tic,</HI> that he might read the volume of na|ture in a country but imperfectly explored, and where her beauties were di&s;played in a
<PB N="220" REF="227">
more extended and magnificent &s;cale, than the narrow bounds of his native country exhibited. It is but too true, that the world at large will for ever treat with ridicule and di&s;dain that man, who, thus de&s;erting the paths that lead to riches, to pre&s;erment, or to honour, gives him&s;elf up to what are commonly deemed unimportant and trifling occupations. Few will give him credit for that &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, for that inexhau&s;ti|ble plea&s;ure, which the inve&s;tigation of na|ture, in all her objects, ince&s;&s;antly holds forth to his mind; or believe, that &s;uch employment can po&s;&s;ibly compen&s;ate for the &s;olid trea&s;ures of gain.</P>
<P><HI>Mark</HI> CATESBY was born about the lat|ter end of 1679, or the beginning of the next year. He acquaints us him&s;elf, that he had very early a propen&s;ity to the &s;tudy of nature; and that his wi&s;h for higher gratifications in this way, fir&s;t led him to <HI>London,</HI> which he emphatically &s;tiles <Q REND="inline">"the center of &s;cience;"</Q> and afterwards impelled him to &s;eek further &s;ources, in di&s;tant parts of the globe. The re&s;idence of &s;ome re|lations
<PB N="221" REF="228">
in <HI>Virginia</HI> favoured his de&s;ign; and he went to that country in 1712, where he &s;taid &s;even years, admiring, and collecting the various productions of the country, without having laid any direct plan for the work he afterwards accompli&s;hed. During this re&s;idence, he communicated &s;eeds and &s;pecimens of plants, both dried, and in a growing &s;tate, to Mr. DALE, of <HI>Braintree,</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> and, &s;ome of his ob&s;ervations on the country, being communicated by this means to Dr. <HI>William</HI> SHERARD, procured him the friend&s;hip and patronage of that gentleman. On his return to <HI>England,</HI> in 1719, he was encouraged by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal of the nobility, of Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, Dr. SHERARD, and other natu|rali&s;ts, who&s;e names he has recorded, to return to <HI>America,</HI> with the profe&s;&s;ed de|&s;ign of de&s;cribing, delineating, and painting the more curious objects of nature. <HI>Caro|lina</HI> was fixed on, as the place of his re&s;i|dence, where he arrived in May 1722. He fir&s;t examined the lower parts of the coun|try, making excur&s;ions from <HI>Charles Town;</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="229">
and afterwards &s;ojourned, for &s;ome time, a|mong the <HI>Indians</HI> in the mountainous regions at and about <HI>Fort Moore.</HI> He then extend|ed his re&s;earches through <HI>Georgia</HI> and <HI>Flo|rida;</HI> and having &s;pent nearly three years on the continent, he vi&s;ited the <HI>Bahama I&s;lands,</HI> taking his re&s;idence in the <HI>I&s;le of Providence;</HI> carrying on his plan, and par|ticularly making collections of fi&s;hes, and &s;ubmarine productions.</P>
<P>On his return to <HI>England,</HI> in the year 1726, his labours having met with the ap|probation of his patrons, Mr. CATESBY made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the art of Etching; and, retiring to <HI>Hoxton,</HI> employed him&s;elf in carrying on his great work, which he publi&s;hed in numbers of twenty plants each. The fir&s;t appeared in the latter end of the year 1730; and the fir&s;t volume, con&s;i&s;ting of 100 plates, was fini&s;hed in 1732: the &s;econd, in 1743; and the Appendix, of twenty plates, in the year 1748.</P>
<P>A regular account of each number, writ|ten by Dr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> MORTIMER, Secretary of the Royal Society, was laid before the

<HEAD>HOUSTON.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who are conver&s;ant with the writings of MILLER, will recollect the frequent mention of the name of Dr. <HI>William</HI> HOUSTON; and that the exotic botany of <HI>England</HI> was greatly enriched by his means. If I err not, Mr. HOUSTON went fir&s;t to the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> in the charac|ter of a &s;urgeon; and, upon his return, after two years re&s;idence at <HI>Leyden,</HI> took degrees in phy&s;ic under BOERHAAVE. This was in 1728 and 1729. At <HI>Leyden,</HI> he in&s;titu|ted a &s;et of Experiments on Brutes; &s;ome
<PB N="232" REF="239">
of which were made in concert with the late celebrated <HI>Van</HI> SWIETEN. They were afterwards publi&s;hed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> Vol. xxxix. under the title of "<HI>Experimenta de Perforatione Thoracis, eju&s;|que in Re&s;piratione Effectibus.</HI>" The re&s;ult of which proved, contrary to the common|ly received opinion, that animals could live and breathe for &s;ome time, although air was freely admitted into both cavities of the thorax.</P>
<P>It appears that he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society &s;oon after his return from <HI>Holland;</HI> and that he went immedi|ately to the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> I am not able to a&s;certain his fixed re&s;idence in that part of the world, although I conjecture, it was principally at the <HI>Logwood Settlement;</HI> from whence he &s;ent a de&s;cription and figure of the <HI>Dor&s;tenia Contrayerva,</HI> which were pub|li&s;hed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> Vol. xxxvii. This was the fir&s;t authentic account received of that drug, although known in <HI>England</HI> from the time of Sir <HI>Francis</HI> DRAKE, or earlier. He al&s;o &s;ent to his friend at <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> the &s;eeds of many rare and

new plants, collected by him in the i&s;lands of <HI>Jamaica</HI> and <HI>Cuba;</HI> in the province of <HI>Venezuela,</HI> and about <HI>Vera Crux.</HI></P>
<P>He fell a &s;acrifice to the heat of the cli|mate, and died in July 1733. He left, in manu&s;cript, a Catalogue of Plants, collect|ed by him&s;elf in the places above men|tioned; together with &s;ome engravings done by his own hand. The&s;e came into the hands of Mr. MILLER; and, after his decea&s;e, into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> BANKS, who, out of re&s;pect to the memory of &s;o de&s;erving a man, gratified the bota|ni&s;ts with the publication of them, under the following title:</P>

<P>Of the <HI>genera</HI> con&s;tituted by HOUSTON, we find the <HI>Dougla&s;&s;ia,</HI> in honour of <HI>James</HI> DOUGLAS, F.R.S. a celebrated &s;urgeon and anatomi&s;t, afterwards M.D. and honorary Fellow of the College of Phy&s;icians, and Phy&s;ician to Queen <HI>Caroline;</HI> whom it is ju&s;t to introduce into the&s;e anecdotes, &s;ince he obtained a reputable rank among tho&s;e, who in botany have been &s;tiled "Monogra|phers," from having &s;eparately written on a &s;ingle &s;pecies or genus.

This phenomenon will appear le&s;s wonderful in our days, when it is known, from the elegant work of Dr. THUNBERG, that from the congeniality of climate between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> one-fourth part of the indigenous plants of that very di&s;tant coun|try, appear to be al&s;o natives of <HI>England.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE increa&s;ing cultivation of exotics in <HI>England,</HI> from the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, and the greater diffu&s;ion of ta&s;te for the elegancies and luxuries of the Stove and Green-hou&s;e, naturally tended to rai&s;e up a &s;pirit of improvement and real &s;cience in the arts of culture. To pre&s;erve far-fetched rarities, it became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;crutinize into the true principles of the art, which ultimately mu&s;t depend on the
<PB N="238" REF="245">
knowledge of the climate of each plant, and the &s;oil in which it flouri&s;hes, in that climate.</P>
<P>Under the influence of &s;uch men as SLOANE, the SHERARDS, and other opu|lent encouragers of the &s;cience, gardeners acquired botanical knowledge, and were excited to greater exertions in their art. Hence, I believe, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gardeners have &s;hewn them&s;elves equal, if not &s;uperior, to mo&s;t others. My plan does not allow me to deviate &s;o far, as to cite authors on the &s;ubject of gardening, unle&s;s eminent for their acquaintance with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botany. Some have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in this way; and I cannot omit to mention with applau&s;e, the names of FAIRCHILD, KNOWLTON, GORDON, and MILLER. The fir&s;t of the&s;e made him&s;elf known to the Royal Society, by &s;ome "New Experiments re|lating to the different, and &s;ometimes contrary Motion of the Sap;" which were printed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;ac|tions,</HI> Vol. xxxiii. p. 127. He al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making experiments, by which the &s;exes of plants were illu&s;trated, and the doctrine
<PB N="239" REF="246">
confirmed. Mr. FAIRCHILD died in No|vember 1729.</P>

<HEAD>KNOWLTON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Thomas</HI> KNOWLTON was, in the earlier part of his life, gardener to Con&s;ul SHE|RARD; but I find him in that &s;tation at <HI>Lone&s;borough,</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> in the &s;ervice of the Earl of BURLINGTON, in the year 1728; in which place, I believe, he &s;pent the greater part, if not the whole, of the remainder of his life. His zeal for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botany was uncommonly great, and recom|mended him &s;ucce&s;sfully to the learned bo|tani&s;ts of this country. From Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, he received eminent civilities. He merits notice in the&s;e memoirs, were it only to record his di&s;covery of that &s;ingu|lar production, the Globe <HI>Conferva,</HI> or Moor Balls (<HI>Conferva Aegagrophila</HI> Lin.); which he fir&s;t found in <HI>Wallingfen Mere.</HI> I have read a letter from him to a corre&s;pondent, written in the year 1728; and another in 1729: in one of which he relates his hav|ing waded near a quarter of a mile into the lake to collect them; which is not done
<PB N="240" REF="247">
without &s;ome difficulty, as they lie at the depth of from two to three feet. At an|other time he was more &s;ucce&s;sful, and col|lected near a bu&s;hel at once. He de&s;cribes them to his friend, under the name of <HI>Pil|las,</HI> or globular Balls of Mo&s;s, of the &s;ize of a tennis ball.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI> KNOWLTON was a man of general curio&s;ity and ob&s;ervation; and, a|mong&s;t other matters, not inattentive to the pur&s;uits of the antiquary.</P>
<P>We find Extracts of Two Letters from him "to Mr. <HI>Mark</HI> CATESBY, F.R.S. concerning the Situation of the ancient Town <HI>Delgovicia,</HI> and of two Men of an extraordinary Bulk and Weight." <HI>Phil. Tran&s;.</HI> Vol. xliv. p. 100. This <HI>Roman</HI> &s;ta|tion was di&s;covered on the Wolds, within two miles of <HI>Pocklington.</HI> Al&s;o,</P>

<P><HI>James</HI> GORDON, of Mile End, eminent for his &s;ucce&s;sful cultivation of exotics, was well acquainted with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botany. I know not that he made him&s;elf known by any publications. He maintained a corre|&s;pondence with LINNAEUS; and had the re&s;pect paid to him by the late Mr. ELLIS, of having the <HI>Loblolly Bay</HI> of CATESBY called by his name, when &s;eparated from the <HI>Hypericum</HI> genus.</P>

<HEAD>MILLER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> MILLER was born in the year 1691. His father was gardener to the Company of Apothecaries at <HI>Chel&s;ea;</HI> and his &s;on &s;ucceeded him in that office, in the year 1722. He rai&s;ed him&s;elf by his merit, from a &s;tate of ob&s;curity, to a degree of
<PB N="242" REF="249">
eminence, but rarely if ever before equalled, in the character of a gardener. It is not uncommon to give the term of Botani&s;t, to any man that can recite by memory, the plants of his garden. Mr. MILLER ro&s;e much above this attainment. He added to the knowledge of the theory and practice of gardening, that of the &s;tructure and cha|racters of plants, and was early and practi|cally ver&s;ed in the methods of RAY and TOURNEFORT. Habituated to the u&s;e of the&s;e, from his younger years, it was not without reluctance that he was brought to adopt the &s;y&s;tem of LINNAEUS; but he was convinced, at length, by the arguments of the late Sir <HI>William</HI> WATSON and Mr. HUDSON, and embraced it. To his &s;uperior &s;kill in his art, the curious owe the culture and pre&s;ervation of a variety of fine plants, which, in le&s;s &s;kilful hands, would have failed, at that time, to adorn the con&s;erva|tories of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>His objects were not confined to exotics: few were better acquainted with the indi|genous plants, of which, he &s;ucce&s;&s;ively cul|tivated mo&s;t of the rare &s;pecies.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="250">
He maintained a corre&s;pondence with many of the mo&s;t eminent botani&s;ts on the continent: among others, with LINNAEUS, who &s;aid of his Dictionary, <HI>Non erit Lexi|con Hortulanorum, &s;ed Botanicorum.</HI> By foreigners he was emphatically &s;tiled <HI>Hor|tulanorum Princeps.</HI> He was admitted a member of the Botanical Academy of <HI>Flo|rence,</HI> and of the Royal Society of <HI>London,</HI> in which he was occa&s;ionally honoured by being cho&s;en of the council. Mr. MIL|LER was the only per&s;on I ever knew, who remembered to have &s;een Mr. RAY. I &s;hall not ea&s;ily forget the plea&s;ure that enlightened his countenance, it &s;o &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Virgilium tantum vidi,</HI> when, in &s;peaking of that revered man, he related to me that incident of his youth.</P>
<P>Mr. MILLER's infirmities induced him to re&s;ign his office in the Garden, a little time before his decea&s;e, which took place December 18, 1771, in the 80th year of his age. He left a very large <HI>Herbarium</HI> of Exotics, principally the produce of the <HI>Chel|&s;ea</HI> Garden.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="251">
In the year 1728, Mr. MILLER com|municated to the Royal Society, "A Me|thod of rai&s;ing &s;ome Exotic Seeds, which have been judged almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be rai&s;ed in <HI>England.</HI>" <HI>Phil. Tran&s;.</HI> N^o 403. Vol. xxxv. p. 485. This con&s;i&s;ted in &s;uf|fering the Seeds to germinate in a bark bed, and then tran&s;planting them into earth. By this method, he &s;ucceeded with all the hard-&s;helled fruits and &s;eeds. He in&s;tances the Cocoa Nut; the Bonduc, or Nickar Tree (<HI>Guilandina Bonduc</HI> Lin.); the <HI>Abrus precatorius;</HI> the Hor&s;e Eye Bean (<HI>Dolichos urens</HI>); and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>"An Account of Bulbous Roots flower|ing in Bottles filled with Water." N^o 418. Vol. xxxvii. p. 81. This method of pro|curing early Hyacinths, Tulips, and Nar|ci&s;&s;u&s;es, at that time lately di&s;covered, is now well known, and daily practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Although he did not prefix his name to it, he was the author of "A Catalogue of Trees, Shrubs, and Flowers, which are hardy enough to bear the cold of our cli|mate, and the open air; and are propa|gated
<PB N="245" REF="252">
in the gardens near <HI>London.</HI>" Fol. 1730. p. 90. tab. 21. The plates are co|loured, the arrangement is alphabetical, and the generical characters given. The Cata|logue con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of Trees and Shrubs; among which are &s;everal of the <HI>Coniferous</HI> kinds. Some varieties are inter&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>"CATALOGUS PLANTARUM OFFICI|NALIUM <HI>quae in Horto Botanico Chel&s;eiano aluntur.</HI>" 1730. 8^o. pp. 152.</P>
<P>In 1731, he publi&s;hed his "Gardener's Dictionary," in folio, which has pa&s;&s;ed through many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive editions; in each of which it received &s;uch improvements, and augmentations, as have rendered it in the end the mo&s;t complete body of garden|ing extant. It has been tran&s;lated into va|rious languages; and the reception it has every where met with, is a &s;ufficient proof of its &s;uperiority. The new edition of it, now under the care of Profe&s;&s;or MARTYN, we doubt not, will extend to a late period, the reputation both of the author, and of the editor.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame, or the &s;ucceeding year, he publi&s;hed "The Gardener's Kalender," in 8^o;
<PB N="246" REF="253">
which has run through numerous edi|tions, and has been a manual, in its way, for the whole kingdom. To an edition of this work, in 1761, the author prefixed "A Short Introduction to the Knowledge of the Science of Botany;" in which he explains the <HI>Linnaean</HI> terms of art, and il|lu&s;trates the characters of the cla&s;&s;es in five copper-plates. This introduction was al&s;o &s;old &s;eparately.</P>
<P>Mr. MILLER held an exten&s;ive corre|&s;pondence with per&s;ons in di&s;tant parts of the globe. From the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> from <HI>Siberia,</HI> from <HI>North America,</HI> and par|ticularly, by means of Dr. <HI>William</HI> HOUS|TON, from the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> his garden, for a long &s;eries of years, received a plentiful and perpetual &s;upply of rare, and frequently of new &s;pecies, which his &s;ucce&s;sful culture &s;el|dom failed to pre&s;erve. It was the remark of foreigners, that <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> exhibited the trea|&s;ures of both the <HI>Indies.</HI> The&s;e advantages enabled MILLER to execute, what it was in the power of few to attempt&mdash;His "Figures of Plants, adapted to his Dic|tionary," which he began to publi&s;h in
<PB N="247" REF="254">
numbers in 1755, and which were com|pleted in 300 tables, making two volumes in folio, in 1760, were drawn from plants of his own garden. His original de&s;ign was very exten&s;ive; no le&s;s than to give one, or more &s;pecies, of all the genera: but it was found to be impracticable; and it was therefore confined to &s;uch as were the mo&s;t beautiful, u&s;eful, and uncommon. Each number was accompanied with &s;eve|ral pages of letter-pre&s;s, containing the de&s;criptions, and an account of the cla&s;&s;es to which they belong, according to the &s;y&s;|tems of RAY, TOURNEFORT, and LIN|NAEUS. As this work is well known, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that whether we con&s;ider the rarity of the &s;ubjects, the &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e he &s;elected for his purpo&s;e, or the ge|neral execution of the whole, <HI>England</HI> had not before produced any work, except the <HI>Hortus Elthamen&s;is,</HI> and CATESBY's <HI>Caro|lina,</HI> &s;o &s;uperb and exten&s;ive.

Mr. MILLER defends his opinion in the "Remarks."

<HEAD>BLACKWELL.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a &s;ingular fact, that phy&s;ic is in|debted for the mo&s;t complete &s;et of figures of the medicinal plants, to the ge|nius and indu&s;try of a lady, exerted on an occa&s;ion that redounded highly to her prai&s;e.</P>
<P>The name of Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> BLACK|WELL is well known, both from her own
<PB N="252" REF="259">
merit, and the fate of her unfortunate hu&s;|band, who, condemned for crimes of &s;tate, &s;uffered death on the &s;caffold in <HI>Sweden,</HI> in the year 1747.</P>
<P>We are informed, &s;he was the daughter of a merchant in the neighbourhood of <HI>Aberdeen;</HI> of which city Dr. <HI>Alexander</HI> BLACKWELL, her hu&s;band, was a native, and where he received an univer&s;ity educa|tion, and was early di&s;tingui&s;hed for his cla&s;&s;ical knowledge. By &s;ome, he is &s;aid only to have a&s;&s;umed the title of Doctor, after his &s;ucce&s;sful attendance on the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> but I believe, the more proba|ble account is, that of his having taken the degree of Doctor of Phy&s;ic under BOER|HAAVE at <HI>Leyden.</HI> After having failed in his attempt to introduce him&s;elf into prac|tice, fir&s;t in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and afterwards in <HI>London,</HI> he became corrector to a printing pre&s;s, and &s;oon after commenced printer him&s;elf. But being pro&s;ecuted by the trade, and at length involved in debt, was thrown into pri&s;on. To relieve the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, Mrs. BLACKWELL, having a genius for drawing and painting, exerted all her talents; and,
<PB N="253" REF="260">
under&s;tanding that an Herbal of Medicinal Plants was greatly wanted, &s;he exhibited to Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, Dr. MEAD, and other phy&s;icians, &s;ome &s;pecimens of her art in painting plants, who approved &s;o highly of them, as to encourage her to pro|&s;ecute a work, by the profits of which &s;he is &s;aid to have procured her hu&s;band's li|berty, after a confinement of two years.</P>
<P>Mr. RAND, an eminent apothecary, was at that time Demon&s;trator to the Company of Apothecaries, in the Garden at <HI>Chel&s;ea.</HI> By his advice &s;he took up her re&s;idence op|po&s;ite the Phy&s;ic Garden, in order to faci|litate her de&s;ign, by receiving the plants as fre&s;h as po&s;&s;ible. He not only promoted her work with the public, but, together with Mr. <HI>Philip</HI> MILLER, afforded her all po&s;&s;ible direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the exe|cution of it. After &s;he had completed the drawings, &s;he engraved them on copper, and coloured the prints with her own hands.</P>
<P>During her abode at <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> &s;he was fre|quently vi&s;ited by per&s;ons of quality, and many &s;cientific people, who admired her
<PB N="254" REF="261">
performances, and patronized her under|taking.</P>
<P>On publi&s;hing the fir&s;t volume, in 1737, &s;he obtained a recommendation from Dr. MEAD, Dr. SHERARD, Mr. RAND, and others, to be prefixed to it. And being allowed to pre&s;ent, in per&s;on, a copy to the College of Phy&s;icians, that body made her a pre&s;ent, and gave her a public te&s;timonial of their approbation; with leave to prefix it to her book. The &s;econd volume was fini&s;hed in 1739, and the whole publi&s;hed under the following title:</P>
<P>"A curious Herbal, containing 500 Cuts of the mo&s;t u&s;eful Plants which are now u&s;ed in the Practice of Phy&s;ic, engraved on folio copper-plates, after drawings taken from the life. By ELIZABETH BLACKWELL. To which is added, a &s;hort De&s;cription of the Plants, and their common U&s;es in Phy&s;ic. 1739." 2 vol. fol.</P>
<P>The drawings are in general faithful; and if there is wanting that accuracy, which modern improvements have rendered nece&s;|&s;ary, in delineating the more minute parts,
<PB N="255" REF="262">
yet, upon the whole, the figures are &s;uffi|ciently di&s;tinctive of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Each plate is accompanied with an en|graved page, containing the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> officinal names, followed by a &s;hort de&s;cription of the plant, and a &s;ummary of its qualities, and u&s;es. After the&s;e occur the name in various other languages. The&s;e illu&s;trations were the &s;hare her hu&s;band took in the work. This ill-fated man, after his failure in phy&s;ic, and in printing, became an un&s;ucce&s;sful candidate for the place of Secretary to the Society for the Encourage|ment of Learning. He was made Super|intendant of the Works belonging to the <HI>Duke of</HI> CHANDOS at <HI>Cannons,</HI> and experi|enced tho&s;e di&s;appointments incident to projectors. He formed &s;chemes in agricul|ture, and wrote a treati&s;e on the &s;ubject, which, we are told, was the cau&s;e of his being engaged in <HI>Sweden.</HI> In that king|dom, he drained mar&s;hes, practi&s;ed phy&s;ic, and was even employed in that capacity for the king. At length he was involved in &s;ome &s;tate cabals, or, as &s;ome accounts have it, in a plot with <HI>Count</HI> TESSIN, for which
<PB N="256" REF="263">
he lo&s;t his life, prote&s;ting his innocence to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>So re&s;pectable a performance as Mrs. BLACKWELL's, attracted the attention of phy&s;icians on the continent. TREW, of <HI>Norimberg,</HI> in the year 1750, engaged an arti&s;t of that place to copy Mrs. BLACK|WELL's plates, and him&s;elf &s;upplied &s;everal defects in the drawings. He &s;ub&s;tituted &s;ome entirely new figures in the room of the ori|ginals, very con&s;iderably reformed and am|plified the text, tran&s;lated it into <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> and planned the addition of a &s;ixth century of plates.

<HEAD>DEERING.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> DEERING was a native of <HI>Saxony:</HI> He took his degrees in phy&s;ic at <HI>Leyden;</HI> and, as Mr. MARTYN informs us, came to <HI>Eng|land</HI> fir&s;t, in the train of a foreign amba&s;&s;a|dor. This happened, I conjecture, before, or about the year 1720. He practi&s;ed phy|&s;ic and midwifery in <HI>London;</HI> and having a &s;trong bias to the &s;tudy of botany, became one of the members of the &s;ociety e&s;tab|li&s;hed by Dr. DILLENIUS and Mr. MAR|TYN, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted from the year 1721 to 1726.</P>
<P>In the year 1736, he removed to <HI>Notting|ham,</HI> under the recommendation of Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE. At this time he was married; but his wife did not long &s;urvive the re|moval to that place. He was at fir&s;t well received; and is &s;aid to have been very &s;uc|ce&s;sful in his treatment of the &s;mall-pox,
<PB N="258" REF="265">
which di&s;ea&s;e was highly epidemical at that place, &s;oon after his &s;ettling there. But he incurred the cen&s;ure of the faculty, by his preten&s;ions to a no&s;trum. He publi&s;hed "An Account of an improved Method of treating the Small-pox, in a Letter to Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> PARKYNS, Bart." 8^o. 1737. pp. 52. By this tract it appears, that his medicine was of the antiphlogi&s;tic kind, and his regimen the cool one, which at that time had been adopted by very few, as ge|neral practice.</P>
<P>Dr. DEERING &s;hewed his attachment to his botanical pur&s;uits, by his a&s;&s;iduity in collecting &s;uch ample materials for his Ca|talogue in le&s;s than two years after fixing at <HI>Nottingham.</HI> He publi&s;hed it under the fol|lowing title:</P>
<P>"A CATALOGUE OF PLANTS naturally growing and commonly cultivated in divers Parts of <HI>England,</HI> more e&s;pecially about <HI>Nottingham:</HI> containing the mo&s;t known <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Names of the &s;everal Plants; the Tribe they belong to; the Time of their flowering; and of tho&s;e which are either Officinals or otherwi&s;e,
<PB N="259" REF="266">
of any known Efficacy, &s;uch Virtues are briefly mentioned as may be depended upon. To which is added, a general Di&s;tribution of Plants according to Mr. RAY; with an Explanation of &s;ome bo|tanical and phy&s;ical Terms; and an al|phabetical Li&s;t of Plants in Flower, for every Month in the Year. By <HI>Charles</HI> DEERING, <HI>M.D. Nottingham.</HI>" 8^o. 1738. pp. 264.</P>
<P>The arrangement is alphabetical, and the number of plants about 850. The author was particularly attached to the &s;ubjects of the <HI>Cryptogamia</HI> cla&s;s, in which his re|&s;earches had been very &s;ucce&s;sful. Of the number above mentioned, more than 200 belonged to the orders of <HI>Fungi, Mu&s;ci,</HI> and <HI>Algae;</HI> among which, we meet with 27 which he con&s;idered as <HI>nonde&s;cripts,</HI> and 10 others not to be met with in the third edi|tion of RAY's <HI>Synop&s;is.</HI> He was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this branch by his corre&s;pondence with the learned Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Oxford,</HI> who con&s;idered &s;ome of his di&s;coveries as new, and &s;peaks of his knowledge and a&s;&s;iduity in terms of applau&s;e. In page 89 of his po&s;thumous
<PB N="260" REF="267">
work, the <HI>Nottinghamia Vetus et Nova,</HI> there occurs a li&s;t of &s;ome plants, di&s;covered by the author after the publication of this Catalogue. The&s;e are principally of the <HI>Cryptogamous</HI> kind. Several of the more rare plants of the environs e&s;caped the ob|&s;ervation of this a&s;&s;iduous man; among which may be mentioned particularly, that mo&s;t virulent of all our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> produc|tions, the <HI>Cicuta viro&s;a,</HI> or, long-leaved Water Hemlock; which I remember to have &s;een growing in the <HI>Leen,</HI> near the <HI>Rock-holes,</HI> in <HI>Nottingham</HI> Park. That the <HI>Addenda</HI> to his "Catalogue" were not more copious may be attributed to his &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes, which undoubtedly damped the ardour of his pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding his early &s;ucce&s;s, that <Q REND="inline">"adver&s;e fatality,"</Q> which he him&s;elf alludes to in his "Letter on the Small-pox," &s;till attended him. He was, unhappily, not en|dowed with that degree of prudence, and e|quanimity of temper, which are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the practice of phy&s;ic; in&s;omuch, that he very early lo&s;t the little intere&s;t which his character and &s;ucce&s;s had at fir&s;t gained.
<PB N="261" REF="268">
But as I would rather dwell on his merits, than on his failings, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that be|&s;ides his acquaintance with the antient lan|guages, he was ma&s;ter of many of the mo|dern tongues. His knowledge of that &s;ci|ence which gives him a place in this &s;ketch, was very con&s;iderable, and will be perpetu|ated, &s;o long as DILLENIUS's "Hi&s;tory" &s;hall pre&s;erve e&s;timation. He had a know|ledge of de&s;igning, and was an ingenious mechanic. After his failure in Phy&s;ic, his friends attempted &s;everal &s;chemes to alleviate his nece&s;&s;ities. They procured him, among others, a commi&s;&s;ion in the regiment rai&s;ed at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> on account of the rebellion. But this proved more honourable than profitable to him. He was afterwards em|ployed in a way more agreeable to his ge|nius, and talents; being furni&s;hed with ma|terials, and enabled by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>John</HI> PLUMTREE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and others, to write the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> which he dedicated to the <HI>Duke of</HI> NEWCASTLE. But he did not live to receive the reward of this la|bour. He had been troubled with the gout at a very early period, having been afflicted

with it in his nineteenth year, and in the latter &s;tage of his life, he &s;uffered long confinements in this di&s;ea&s;e, and became a&s;thmatical. Being at length reduced to a degree of poverty, and dependance, which his &s;pirit could not &s;u&s;tain, oppre&s;&s;ed with calamity, and complicated di&s;ea&s;e, he died April 12, 1749. Two of his principal cre|ditors admini&s;tered to his effects, and buried him in <HI>St. Peter's</HI> church-yard, oppo&s;ite the hou&s;e in which he re&s;ided.</P>
<P>He left an <HI>Hortus Siccus</HI> of the plants of his "Catalogue," con&s;i&s;ting of upwards of 600 &s;pecies, in eight volumes, of the quarto form; be&s;ides &s;eparate tables of the <HI>Mo&s;&s;es,</HI> and a volume of paintings of the <HI>Fungi,</HI> ac|curately done by his own hand. Some part, if not the whole, of this collection, was, I believe, purcha&s;ed by the Honourable <HI>Roth|well</HI> WILLOUGHBY, who had been one of his benefactors, while living, and inherited a portion of that ta&s;te, which di&s;tingui&s;hed his family in the time of Mr. RAY.

<HEAD>WILSON.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ubject of this article, like <HI>Tho|mas</HI> WILLISEL, and <HI>Samuel</HI> BREWER, is another in&s;tance of that unconquerable at|tachment to a favourite branch of know|ledge, which &s;ometimes engro&s;&s;es the minds of tho&s;e, who, by their lot, have not been exempted from labouring in the lower, and mechanical offices of life.</P>
<P>From information which I received, more than twenty years ago, concerning <HI>John</HI> WILSON, I learned that he was originally an inhabitant of <HI>Kendal,</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmoreland;</HI> and was employed in the manufacture of knit &s;tockings, for which that town was &s;o famous. That, at one time, he gave weekly
<PB N="265" REF="272">
le&s;&s;ons on botany, alternately, at that place, and at <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI> That many pupils re|&s;orted to him from the neighbouring parts of <HI>Scotland;</HI> in&s;omuch, that in &s;ome &s;ea|&s;ons, he received &s;ixty pounds a year, as the premium of his labours.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not, however, omit to ob&s;erve, that this account does not coincide with another, which I have &s;ince met with in the "<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Topography;" the re&s;pectable author of which informs us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That WIL|SON was a &s;hoemaker, and by his inten&s;e application to his favourite &s;tudy, lived mo&s;t of his life in a &s;tate of indigence. A cow, of which his wife had the care, was the &s;ole &s;upport of his family: and &s;uch was his infatuation, that he was once tempted to part with that mo&s;t u&s;e|ful animal, to purcha&s;e MORISON's vo|luminous work, had not a neighbouring lady pre&s;ented him with the book, and re&s;cued the poor man and his family from beggary and ruin."</Q></P>
<P>In this repre&s;entation of WILSON's con|duct, while men of &s;ympathizing minds,
<PB N="266" REF="273">
and &s;imilar ta&s;te, mu&s;t deplore that hard fate which reduced him to &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity, they mu&s;t yet more &s;trongly cen&s;ure a ra&s;h|ne&s;s, which could tempt him to ri&s;k, in &s;o e&s;&s;ential a manner, the welfare of his fa|mily.</P>
<P>As WILSON exhibited to the public, a &s;ingular proof of his knowledge in this his principal object, I am inclined to believe, that he mu&s;t, originally, either have had &s;ome grammar education, or, impelled by his genius, mu&s;t afterwards have acquired a knowledge of the <HI>Latin</HI> language. How el&s;e (except on the &s;uppo&s;ition of extraordi|nary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, of which I have no informa|tion) could he have made u&s;e of MORISON's "Hi&s;tory," or have tran&s;lated RAY's <HI>Sy|nop&s;is!</HI> In 1744, he publi&s;hed "A SY|NOPSIS OF BRITISH PLANTS in Mr. RAY's METHOD; with their Characters, De&s;criptions, Places of Growth, Time of Flowering, and phy&s;ical Virtues, accord|ing to the mo&s;t accurate Ob&s;ervations, and the be&s;t modern Authors; together with a Botanical Dictionary, illu&s;trated
<PB N="267" REF="274">
with &s;everal Figures. By <HI>John</HI> WILSON. <HI>Newca&s;tle upon Tyne.</HI>" 8^o. 1744. pp. 272.</P>
<P>Throughout this work, the author has prefixed copious characters to each genus, taken, as it appears, from RAY and TOURNE|FORT; into many of which, in conformity to RAY's method, he introduces the form of the leaves, and the habit of the plant. By this means, having added, in mo&s;t in|&s;tances, &s;hort de&s;criptions of the &s;pecies, his book was an u&s;eful pocket manual, as far as it extended; for he begins with the Ca|pillary plants, and ends with the Bulbous rooted. He &s;ubjoins the particular places of the rare plants in the northern parts of <HI>England,</HI> from his own ob&s;ervations, and, partly from a manu&s;cript of Mr. LAW|SON's. His remarks on the properties and virtues, additional to tho&s;e from RAY, he has principally extracted from MILLER's "<HI>Botanicum Officinale.</HI>"</P>
<P>WILSON has made &s;ome tran&s;po&s;itions in the di&s;tribution of his &s;ubjects in this vo|lume, which prove that he had attentively examined plants, and was well acquainted
<PB N="268" REF="275">
with the &s;y&s;tem of RAY. Some of his al|terations will &s;tand the te&s;t of modern accu|racy, though others may be le&s;s happy.</P>
<P>He has placed all the &s;pecies of the <HI>Fu|maria</HI> genus together, in the <HI>Papilionaceous</HI> cla&s;s; and, agreeably to the hint which DILLENIUS gives in the <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> p. 316, has referred the <HI>Plantains,</HI> and <HI>Sponges,</HI> to the <HI>Monopetalous</HI> flowers &s;ucceeded by dry &s;eed ve&s;&s;els. The removal of the <HI>Ly&s;ima|chiae &s;iliquo&s;ae,</HI> the two <HI>Papavera corniculata,</HI> the <HI>Chelidonium,</HI> and the <HI>Bal&s;amine,</HI> to the <HI>Si|liquo&s;e</HI> or Tetradynamous cla&s;s of LINNAEUS, is le&s;s to be approved. By the&s;e changes, he has nearly annihilated RAY's twenty|&s;econd cla&s;s of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> herbs. In tran&s;|po&s;ing of &s;pecies, he has made more nume|rous alterations; &s;ome of which are &s;uffi|ciently ju&s;tified by modern improvements. Thus he has brought under one genus the <HI>Scordium</HI> and <HI>Scorodonia.</HI> He has referred the <HI>Raphanus ru&s;ticanus</HI> to the <HI>Cochlearia</HI> genus, as TOURNEFORT had done. The <HI>Chelidonium</HI> genus is &s;eparated from the <HI>Papaver,</HI> and a new characteri&s;tic note framed, but the name <HI>Papaver corniculatum</HI>
<PB N="269" REF="276">
pre&s;erved. The only two plants met with in this book, which do not occur in the <HI>Synop&s;is</HI> of RAY, are &s;uch as have a doubt|ful title to the appellation of indigenous: they are the <HI>Valeriana rubra,</HI> and <HI>Allium Schaenopra&s;um.</HI></P>
<P>I believe he died about the year 1750, or &s;oon after. He left the remaining part of his work, on the <HI>Graminaceous</HI> and <HI>Cryp|togamous</HI> tribes, compleat in manu&s;cript. In the year 1762, a per&s;on of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> into who&s;e hands the manu&s;cript had pa&s;&s;ed, meditated the publication of it, with a new edition of the work now &s;po|ken of, which was out of print, and much called for; but the de&s;ign never took effect.</P>

<P>The que&s;tion concerning the cau&s;e of the black colour of the &s;kin in Negroes, has exerci&s;ed the pens of many philo&s;ophers and anatomi&s;ts. What has perplexed the que&s;|tion the more is, that the&s;e ingenious wri|ters (among whom are principally <HI>Malpighi, Boyle, Win&s;low, Meckel,</HI> and <HI>Barrere</HI>) have differed about matters of fact that &s;hould &s;eem to be cognizable by the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>It would be improper in this work to pur&s;ue the learned author through all his ingenious details and curious <HI>&s;cholia</HI> on this &s;ubject; it mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that, on the <HI>Newtonian</HI> doctrine of the cau&s;es of colours, he deduces the colour of the &s;kin of Negroes from the &s;tructure, after e&s;tabli&s;hing certain propo&s;itions: 1. That the colour of White People proceeds from the colour which the <HI>epidermis</HI> tran&s;mits. 2. That the den&s;ity of the &s;kins of Negroes allows of no tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of colour. 3. The
<PB N="280" REF="287">
part of the &s;kin which appears black in Negroes, is the <HI>corpus reticulare cutis,</HI> and external <HI>lamella</HI> of the <HI>epidermis.</HI> 4. That the colour does not proceed from any black humour or fluid parts contained in their &s;kins. 5. That the <HI>epidermis,</HI> e&s;pecially its external <HI>lamella,</HI> is divided into two parts, by its pores and &s;cales, 200 times le&s;s than the particles of bodies, on which their co|lours depend. Hence Dr. MITCHELL con|cludes, <Q REND="inline">"that the proximate cau&s;e of the colour of Negroes is threefold; <HI>viz.</HI> the opacity of their &s;kins, proceeding from the thickne&s;s and den&s;ity of the texture, which ob&s;tructs the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the rays of light from the white and red parts below them; together with their greater refrac|tive power, which ab&s;orbs tho&s;e rays; and the &s;mallne&s;s of the particles of their &s;kins, which hinder them to reflect any light."</Q> After which, he di&s;cour&s;es on the influence of the &s;un, and the modes of life among the inhabitants of hot countries, as the remote cau&s;es of the colour of Negroes and In|dians.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>EHRET.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the various contingencies which favoured the introduction of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;y&s;tem into <HI>England,</HI> it is not unimportant to mention the effect of the admirable pencil of the late Mr. EHRET. This ingenious arti&s;t brought with him, not only a general ta&s;te for botany, but a particular knowledge of the principles, on which the &s;y&s;tem of LINNAEUS was found|ed; and was among the fir&s;t who di&s;played it, in the &s;pecimens of his art.</P>
<P>The father of <HI>George Dyoni&s;ius</HI> EHRET was gardener to the Prince of <HI>Baden Dur|lach</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Charles,</HI> Prince of <HI>Baden Durlach,</HI> was a patron of botany, and his garden was famous at that time. He &s;ent his principal &s;uperintendant of the garden, on the un|fortunate expedition with HEBENSTREIT, into <HI>Africa.</HI></NOTE>. <PB N="285" REF="292">
 Young EHRET very early &s;hewed a ta&s;te for drawing, and painting the flowers of the garden. And although he received no in&s;tructions, yet &s;uch was his proficien|cy, that, whil&s;t a very young man, he had painted 500 plants with a &s;kill and accu|racy that was almo&s;t unexampled, under the di&s;advantages of &s;o total a want of in|&s;truction as our young arti&s;t had experi|enced. His merit, however, remained long unknown, or at lea&s;t ineffectually noticed, until it was di&s;covered by a gentleman of curio&s;ity and judgment, who vi&s;ited the garden, of which his father was the &s;uper|intendant. Fortunately for young EHRET, this &s;tranger was a phy&s;ician and a friend of the celebrated Dr. TREW, of <HI>Norimberg,</HI> to whom he ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed the&s;e paintings would be acceptable. EHRET by this means was introduced to TREW, who immediately purcha&s;ed the whole 500 paintings, and ge|nerou&s;ly gave him double the price at which the young arti&s;t had mode&s;tly valued them.
<PB N="286" REF="293">
The liberality of TREW, by which EHRET put 4000 florins into his pocket, in&s;pired him with confidence in his own abilities, and &s;uch a &s;hare of ambition as inclined him to quit his home, and &s;eek at once to rai&s;e his for|tune, and to gratify the de&s;ire he had to &s;ee the world. It appears that he was too much elated with his &s;ucce&s;s; and, as the effect of &s;ome &s;hare of vanity, and a want of oeco|nomy not unu&s;ual in young men, he &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated this &s;um, and, in que&s;t of adven|tures, went to <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> with the la&s;t, and tho&s;e only a few, of his florins in his pocket. Here, &s;hutting him&s;elf up, he, with great diligence, and &s;ingular exertion, &s;timulated now by pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity, &s;oon exhibited numerous &s;pecimens of his art; and, though he had learned to &s;et a higher value upon them, found a demand beyond his indu&s;|try to &s;upply. Having thus recruited his finances, he journeyed into <HI>France,</HI> and re|&s;ided &s;ome time at <HI>Montpelier,</HI> where he taught his art to a lady of fortune, who re|warded him generou&s;ly, and, on his wi&s;h to remove, paid his expences to <HI>Lyons</HI> and <HI>Pa|ris.</HI> At the latter city he became known to JUSSIEU, and was for &s;ome time employed
<PB N="287" REF="294">
to paint the plants of the Royal Garden, under that eminent Profe&s;&s;or's in&s;pection. After a certain time, he exchanged his &s;itu|ation at <HI>Paris,</HI> for that of <HI>London;</HI> but not &s;ucceeding to his mind, he &s;oon returned to the continent. The preci&s;e time of his being fir&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> I cannot a&s;certain; but it was, I conjecture, before his employ|ment in the garden of Mr. CLIFFORD, where LINNAEUS found him in the year 1736. From LINNAEUS him&s;elf he was taught attention to the parts of the flower, and hence became early in&s;tructed in the principles of the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem. His fine ta&s;te, and botanical accuracy, were, I ap|prehend, fir&s;t publicly manife&s;ted in the figures of the <HI>Hortus Cli&s;&s;ortianus,</HI> pub|li&s;hed in 1737; and, from that time, EH|RET became &s;trongly attached to the prin|ciples of the <HI>Swede.</HI></P>
<P>He returned to <HI>England</HI> about the year 1740, or &s;oon after that period: and here he &s;pent the remainder of his days. His fir&s;t patron in this country was <HI>Taylor</HI> WHITE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for whom he fini&s;hed 300 paintings of plants. He &s;oon after procured the patro|nage of Dr. MEAD, for whom he painted
<PB N="288" REF="295">
200, and who generou&s;ly advanced his price. In con&s;equence of this countenance and protection, he obtained encouragement from Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, and many other opulent lovers of his art. Dr. FOTHERGILL pro|cured large collections from him; and the late eminent patrone&s;s of natural hi&s;tory, the <HI>Duche&s;s of</HI> PORTLAND, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, be&s;ides near 300 paintings of exotics, upwards of 500 of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plants, done on vellum, and highly fini&s;hed, by this admirable arti&s;t.</P>
<P>Another of his patrons, and to who&s;e obliging information I owe great part of the foregoing anecdotes relating to him, was <HI>Ralph</HI> WILLETT, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Merly,</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et|&s;hire;</HI> at who&s;e &s;eat Mr. EHRET was ac|cu&s;tomed, for many years, to &s;pend &s;everal weeks in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, and in who&s;e friend&s;hip Mr. EHRET repo&s;ed, as executor in the la&s;t arrangement of his affairs. The library at <HI>Merly</HI> exhibits a copious collec|tion of exotics, done by EHRET: not fewer than 230 fini&s;hed &s;pecimens on vellum; be&s;ides &s;eventy on paper; and more than 500 in an unfini&s;hed &s;tate.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t publi&s;hed &s;pecimens of his pen|cil, after his &s;ettlement in <HI>England,</HI> that I
<PB N="289" REF="296">
am acquainted with, were exhibited in the 44th volume of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> N^o 478. for January and February 1746; by the figure of the <HI>Keratophyton flabelli|forme</HI> of RAY (Gorgonia verruco&s;a <HI>Lin.</HI>) for a paper written by Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE: and by two excellent figures of the <HI>Oe|nanthe erocata,</HI> and <HI>Cieuta viro&s;a,</HI> in the &s;ame volume, intended to illu&s;trate Mr. WATSON's ob&s;ervations on the fatal Qua|lities of tho&s;e Plants.</P>
<P>Very early after his arrival in this king|dom, he began to paint figures of the rare&s;t products of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gardens, for his friend and fir&s;t patron Dr. TREW; for whom, in the end, he fini&s;hed 300. Of the&s;e, at different periods, 100 were engraved, and publi&s;hed in <HI>Decads,</HI> under the following title:</P>

<P>Seven <HI>Decads</HI> of this work were publi&s;h|ed at Dr. TREW's expence, during his life|time; and the remaining three by Dr. VO|GEL, after his decea&s;e. The whole is exe|cuted in &s;o &s;plendid a manner, as to con&s;ti|tute, at this day, one of the fine&s;t orna|ments of the botanical library.</P>
<P>The only publication of any importance in <HI>England,</HI> in which Mr. EHRET was en|gaged throughout, as far as I can find, was BROWN's "Natural Hi&s;tory of <HI>Jamaica,</HI>" printed in 1756, for which he drew all the figures, amounting to 40 tables. As they were principally taken from prepared and dried &s;pecimens, they cannot be numbered among his capital performances.</P>
<P>Mr. EHRET drew, and him&s;elf engraved, a &s;et of tables of Exotics, two or three on each plate, to the number of fifteen; each table containing al&s;o a Butterfly of exotic origin. The&s;e were publi&s;hed at <HI>London,</HI> in 1748-1759. The la&s;t of the&s;e exhi|bits the Cape Ja&s;mine, <HI>Gardenia florida,</HI> which had flowered for the fir&s;t time in

<P>His ingenuity and knowledge of nature rai&s;ed him to a degree of reputation among the literati, and obtained him the di&s;tinction of being cho&s;en a Fellow of the Royal So|ciety. Be&s;ides the profit accruing from tho&s;e numerous exhibitions of his pencil, he applied for many years, with great a&s;&s;idui|ty, to the bu&s;ine&s;s of teaching his art; and if his ingenuity did not meet with a reward equal to his merit, yet his labours, in the end, proved &s;ufficiently lucrative, to afford him a moderate independence; though, to the la&s;t, he cea&s;ed not to employ his pencil.</P>
<P>He died in September 1770, in the 60th year of his age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. EHRST was complimented by Dr. TREW, in the Third Decad of the <HI>Plantae Selectae,</HI> with a new ge|nus, which he called by his name.

Having early imbibed the principles of <HI>Linnaeus's</HI> &s;y&s;tem, he at|tended to the di&s;crimination of the parts on which it was founded, with an accuracy that commanded ob&s;ervance; and while his excellence in delineating and painting drew admiration, and diffu&s;ed a ta&s;te for the &s;tudy of plants, the truth of his pencil in|&s;tructed tho&s;e who beheld it in the prin|ciples of the &s;cience.</P>

<P>About the year 1751, Dr. HILL began to publi&s;h on the &s;ubject of botany. His "Hi&s;tory of Plants," printed in that year, although compiled and tran&s;lated princi|pally from LINNAEUS, was not adapted to indigenous botany, nor &s;ufficiently calcu|lated to in&s;truct the &s;tudent in the ultimate

<HEAD>WATSON.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG tho&s;e learned botani&s;ts of <HI>England,</HI> who early recognized the prevailing excellencies of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;y&s;|tem, mu&s;t be ranked the late Sir <HI>William</HI> WATSON. At a period when Botany was feebly &s;upported in the&s;e kingdoms, after the decea&s;e of the SHERARDS, and the re|tirement of SLOANE, his talents and his zeal enabled him, as far as the influence of
<PB N="296" REF="303">
an individual could extend, to &s;u&s;tain and promote this &s;cience, not only with his own countrymen, but with tho&s;e learn|ed foreigners who vi&s;ited this kingdom. Whil&s;t, therefore, ju&s;tice to his character and attainments, in the &s;ubject of this work, demand con&s;ideration, I feel an addi|tional motive to pay a tribute to his me|mory, ari&s;ing from a grateful remembrance of the friend&s;hip and corre&s;pondence with which he honoured me.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> WATSON was born in 1715, in <HI>St. John's Street,</HI> near <HI>Smith&s;ield.</HI> His fa|ther was a reputable trade&s;man in that &s;treet, and died, leaving him very young. When he had attained to a proper age, he was &s;ent to Merchant Taylor's School; and from thence was apprenticed to Mr. <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> apothecary, in 1730.</P>
<P>In his youth he had a &s;trong propen&s;ity to the &s;tudy of natural hi&s;tory, and parti|cularly to that of plants. This led him to make frequent excur&s;ions in a morning, &s;e|veral miles from <HI>London;</HI> &s;o that he became early well acquainted with the <HI>Loci natales</HI> of the indigenous plants of the environs of
<PB N="297" REF="304">
<HI>London;</HI> and, during his apprentice&s;hip, he gained the honorary premium given annu|ally by the Apothecaries Company, to &s;uch young men as exhibit a &s;uperiority in the knowledge of plants, in tho&s;e excur&s;ions made by the Demon&s;trator of <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> Gar|den; and in&s;tituted for the purpo&s;e of ini|tiating the apprentices of the Company in a &s;cience &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the profe&s;&s;ion. This premium, as hath been ob&s;erved in the cour&s;e of the preceding pages, con&s;i&s;ted of a hand&s;omely bound copy of RAY's <HI>Synop&s;is.</HI> He continued, at times, throughout his life, to attend on the&s;e occa&s;ions, and meet his former a&s;&s;ociates with great plea&s;ure and delight.</P>
<P>In 1738, Mr. WATSON married, and &s;et up in bu&s;ine&s;s for him&s;elf. His &s;kill, his activity, and diligence in his profe&s;&s;ion, &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him among his acquaintance; as did his ta&s;te for natural hi&s;tory, and his general knowledge of philo&s;ophical &s;ubjects among the members of the Royal Society, of which honourable body he was elected a member early in the year 1741; his two fir&s;t communications being printed in the
<PB N="298" REF="305">
41&s;t volume of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;ac|tions.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after his admi&s;&s;ion into the Royal Society, Mr. WATSON di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf as a botani&s;t. His earlie&s;t paper on this &s;ubject was, "An Account of the ce|lebrated HALLER's <HI>Enumeratio Stirpium Helvetiae,</HI> extracted from the <HI>Latin,</HI> and illu&s;trated with a <HI>Con&s;pectus</HI> of the au|thor's method, and with various ob&s;er|vations." This was printed in the <HI>Phi|lo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vol. xlii. p. 369-80.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame volume<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">p. 599.</NOTE>, and in the &s;uc|ceeding<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Vol. xliii. N^o 473. p. 51.</NOTE>, he excited the attention of the curious in this way, by &s;ome "Critical Re|marks on the Rev. Mr. PICKERING's Paper concerning the Seeds of Mu&s;h|rooms," which, that gentleman having &s;een a &s;hort time before, con&s;idered as a new di&s;covery; whereas Mr. WATSON &s;hewed, that they had been demon&s;trated &s;everal years prior to that period, by M. MICHELI, in his "<HI>Nova Plantarum Genera,</HI>" printed at <HI>Florence</HI> in 1729.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="306">
But that which attracted the attention of foreign botani&s;ts particularly, was his de|&s;cription of a rare and elegant &s;pecies of <HI>Fungus,</HI> called from its form <HI>Gea&s;ter</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Phil.

<P>In the &s;ame volume are in&s;erted &s;ome very in&s;tructive ob&s;ervations on the <HI>Cicuta,</HI> or Common Hemlock; occa&s;ioned by the death of two of the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;oldiers, quartered at <HI>Waltham Abbey,</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> which hap|pened in con&s;equence of their having eaten this herb in&s;tead of Greens<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<P>The death of two of the <HI>French</HI> pri&s;oners in 1746, occa&s;ioned by their eating the roots of the <HI>Hemlock Dropwort,</HI> produced from Mr. WATSON a paper, which in an eminent manner exemplified his &s;kill in the knowledge of plants. It abounds with curious and critical ob&s;ervations on that plant, and on the <HI>Sium Erucae folio</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;|par</HI> BAUHINE (Cicuta viro&s;a <HI>Lin.</HI>) with which it had been frequently confounded;

<P>In the 45^t^h volume of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> is printed a Tran&s;lation, by Mr. WATSON, of a Letter to Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, from Dr. GARCIN, of <HI>Neuchatel,</HI> containing a complete hi&s;tory of the <HI>Cypre&s;s</HI> of the an|tients; the <HI>Henna,</HI> or <HI>Alcanna</HI> of the <HI>Ara|bians,</HI> called by LINNAEUS <HI>Law&s;onia inermis;</HI> a Shrub, famous for its u&s;e, both in medi|cine, and as a dye, all over the Ea&s;t, in&s;o|much that, at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the duty on this drug amounts to 18,000 ducats annu|ally<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ib.

<P>In 1748, Mr. WATSON had an opportu|nity of &s;hewing attention to M. KALM, dur|ing his abode in <HI>England,</HI> which was from February till Augu&s;t, when he embarked for <HI>America.</HI> He introduced him to the curi|ous gardens, and accompanied him in &s;eve|ral botanical excur&s;ions in the environs of <HI>London.</HI> This eminent pupil of LINNAEUS,
<PB N="301" REF="308">
who was a <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> divine, on his return home, became Profe&s;&s;or of Oeconomy at <HI>Abo,</HI> where he died Nov. 16, 1779, aged 63.</P>
<P>The &s;ame civilities were manife&s;ted by Dr. WATSON to the pre&s;ent eminent Dr. PALLAS, of <HI>Peter&s;burgh,</HI> during his abode in <HI>England,</HI> which was from July 1761, to April 1762.</P>
<P>In 1749, in company with Dr. MIT|CHELL, Mr. WATSON examined the re|mains of the garden, formerly belonging to the TRADESCANTS; of whom, &s;ee chap. 14. of this work. They found the <HI>Arbu|tus,</HI> and the <HI>Cupre&s;&s;us Americana,</HI> with other exotics, in a vigorous &s;tate, after having &s;u&s;|tained the winters of this climate for 120 years. This &s;ituation had al&s;o afforded a proof, not often exemplified, of the large &s;ize to which the <HI>Common Buck-Thorn</HI> will grow. They found one about 20 feet high, and near a foot in diameter<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Phil. Tran&s;.</HI> Vol. xlvi. p. 160.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1751, were laid before the public, &s;ome very curious and intere&s;ting particu|lars, relating to the &s;exes of plants, which
<PB N="302" REF="309">
tended to confirm the truth of that doctrine in a remarkable manner. The&s;e were oc|ca&s;ioned by a letter from Mr. MYLINS, of <HI>Berlin,</HI> informing Mr. WATSON, that a tree of the <HI>Palma major foliis flabelliformibus,</HI> which, although it had borne fruit for 30 years pa&s;t, had never brought any to per|fection, until the flowers of a male-tree, brought from <HI>Leip&s;ic,</HI> 20 <HI>German</HI> miles di&s;|tant, had been &s;u&s;pended over its branches. After this operation, the tree yielded, the fir&s;t year, above 100, and the &s;econd, upon repeating the experiment, above 2000 ripe fruit; from which 11 young Palm-trees had been propagated<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Phil.

<P>In the &s;ame volume are &s;ome remarks on the ca&s;e of two women in <HI>Brabant,</HI> who had been nearly poi&s;oned by eating the leaves of what had been called <HI>White Henbane;</HI> but Mr. WATSON proved, that it mu&s;t have been the <HI>Hyo&s;eyamas niger,</HI> &s;ince the <HI>white</HI> does not grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly in that coun|try.

<P>Mr. WATSON, about this time, was the fir&s;t, as I apprehend, who communicated to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reader, an Account of a Re|volution which was about to take place among the learned, in Botany and Zoolo|gy, re&s;pecting the removal of a large body of marine productions, which had hereto|fore been ranked among vegetables; but which were now proved to be of animal origin, and &s;tand under the name of Zoo|phytes, in the pre&s;ent <HI>Sy&s;tem of Nature.</HI> It
<PB N="305" REF="312">
may be ea&s;ily &s;een that this re&s;pects the Corals, Corallines, <HI>E&s;charae,</HI> Madrepores, Sponges, &amp;c. and although even GESNER, IMPERATUS, and RUMPHIUS, had &s;ome ob&s;cure ideas relating to the dubious &s;truc|ture of this cla&s;s, yet the full di&s;covery, that the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances were the fabrications of Polypes, was owing to M.

<P>After its e&s;tabli&s;hment in <HI>Montagu Hou&s;e,</HI> Mr. WATSON was very a&s;&s;iduous, not only in the internal arrangement of &s;ubjects, but al&s;o in getting the garden furni&s;hed with plants; in&s;omuch that, in the fir&s;t year of its e&s;tabli&s;hment, in 1756, it contained no fewer than 600 &s;pecies, all in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate.</P>
<P>Having given ample &s;pecimens of the ge|nius and abilities of Mr. WATSON, as a na|turali&s;t, we mu&s;t now con&s;ider his talents in &s;ome other branches of knowledge. Among the&s;e, nothing contributed &s;o much to ex|tend his fame, and enlarge his connexions with men of &s;cience, as his di&s;coveries in
<PB N="311" REF="318">
electricity. He became early enamoured with the phaenomena of this wonderful agent in nature; an attention to which had been &s;ome time before excited, among the philo&s;ophers of <HI>Europe;</HI> and particularly in <HI>England,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Stephen</HI> GRAY, of the Charter-Hou&s;e; <HI>Granville</HI> WHELER, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Dr. DESAGULIERS; and others.</P>
<P>About the year 1744, Mr. WATSON took it up, and made &s;everal important di&s;|coveries in it. At this time, it was no &s;mall advancement in the progre&s;s of elec|tricity, to be able to fire &s;pirit of wine. He was the fir&s;t in <HI>England</HI> who effected this, and he performed it, both by the <HI>direct,</HI> and the <HI>repul&s;ive</HI> power of electricity. He afterwards fired inflammable air, gunpow|der, and inflammable oils, by the &s;ame means. He al&s;o in&s;tituted &s;everal other experiments, which helped to enlarge the power of the electrician; but the mo&s;t important of his di&s;coveries was, the prov|ing, that the electric power was not created by the globe or tube, but only collected by them. Dr. FRANKLIN, and Mr. WIL|SON,

<P>AS Mr. WATSON had con&s;tantly lived in <HI>London,</HI> he had been a curious ob&s;erver of the wonderful increa&s;e and im|provement of that va&s;t city. He was ac|quainted, in no ordinary degree, with its hi&s;tory, and its police in general; and had particularly attended to tho&s;e circum&s;tances that were more immediately the objects of
<PB N="320" REF="327">
the philo&s;opher and the phy&s;ician. This knowledge enabled him frequently to &s;ug|ge&s;t u&s;eful hints; one of which highly de|&s;erves to be mentioned, as it re&s;pects an object of great importance to the public.</P>
<P>In the hard winter of 1756, he wrote "Some Ob&s;ervations on preventing the freezing of Water in the Leaden Pipes of the City of <HI>London;</HI>" occa&s;ioned by the injudicious and ineffectual method, practi&s;ed frequently, of &s;trewing dung in the &s;treets over the pipes. The&s;e were printed in the <HI>Gentleman's Magazine</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The method was &s;imply by means of two addi|tional bra&s;s cocks. One to be in&s;erted into the leaden pipe, two feet before it comes into the air, guarded by a wooden ca&s;e, filled up with hor&s;e litter, and reaching near to the &s;urface of the ground, and covered over, even with the ground, by a brick or &s;tone. This is to &s;erve as a &s;top-cock, and to be turned by the help of an iron key. The other cock is to be fa&s;tened to the leaden pipe in the open air, in any part of its length, provided it be &s;omewhat below the level of the &s;top-cock. This is in|&s;erted &s;imply to empty the leaden pipe of all its water, after it has been turned off by the &s;top-cock.

out a &s;ucce&s;sful method of effecting the purpo&s;e, which he had him&s;elf employed in the &s;evere winter of 1739-40. Other in&s;tances, be&s;ides this, occur, of his atten|tion to whatever might advance the wel|fare of the public. So early as the year 1742, he had laid before the Royal So|ciety "Some Ob&s;ervations upon Mr. <HI>Sut|ton</HI>'s Invention to extract the foul and &s;tinking Air from the Well and other Parts of Ships: With critical Remarks upon the U&s;e of Wind&s;ails."

<P>All who were acquainted with the ex|tent

This event took place in 1757, previous to which he had been cho&s;en a member of the Royal Academy of <HI>Madrid;</HI> and he was created doctor of phy&s;ic by the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Halle,</HI> under a diploma, bear|ing date September the 6th.

<P>This alteration in his circum&s;tances and pro&s;pects, hazardous as it might be confi|dered by &s;ome, occa&s;ioned no diminution in his emoluments, but far the contrary.

This was a young man, aged twenty-eight, who died after being afflicted with an a&s;thma only two months. The lungs were found in an extraordinarily emphy&s;ematous &s;tate, and the pulmonary

<P>In 1768, Dr. WATSON publi&s;hed "An Account of a Series of Experiments, in|&s;tituted with a view of a&s;certaining the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful Method of inoculating the Small-pox." 8^o. The&s;e experiments were de&s;igned to prove whether there was any <HI>&s;pecific</HI> virtue in preparatory medi|cines: whether the di&s;ea&s;e was more fa|vourable when the matter was taken from
<PB N="331" REF="338">
the natural, or the artificial pock: and, whether the crude lymph, or the highly-concocted matter, produced different effects. The re&s;ult was, what &s;ucceeding and am|ple experience has confirmed, that after due ab&s;tinence from animal food, and heat|ing liquors, it is of &s;mall importance what kind of variolous matter is u&s;ed; and that no preparatory &s;pecifics are to be re|garded.</P>

<P>This di&s;ea&s;e, on which Dr. WHYTT, Dr. WATSON, and others, have lately writ|ten in &s;o in&s;tructive a manner, de&s;erves to be accurately noticed, and the knowledge of it &s;trongly inculcated; as, in the coun|try at lea&s;t, it is not unfrequently mi&s;ta|ken, and treated as a putrid and comato&s;e fever.</P>
<P>As Dr. WATSON lived in intimacy with the mo&s;t illu&s;trious and learned Fellows of the Royal Society; &s;o he was him&s;elf one of its mo&s;t active members, and ever zealous in promoting the ends of that in|&s;titution. For many years he was a fre|quent member of the council; and, during the pre&s;ident&s;hip of Sir <HI>John</HI> PRINGLE, was elected one of the vice-pre&s;idents; which honourable office he continued to fill to the
<PB N="333" REF="340">
end of his days. He was a mo&s;t con&s;tant attendant on the public meetings of the Society; and on the private a&s;&s;ociations of its members, e&s;pecially on that formerly held every Thur&s;day, at the Mitre, in <HI>Fleet Street,</HI> and now at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, in the <HI>Strand.</HI></P>
<P>In 1784, Dr. WATSON was cho&s;en a Fellow of the Royal College of Phy&s;i|cians; and made one of the Elects. In the &s;ucceeding year, he communicated to the College, "An Account of a di&s;ea&s;e occa|&s;ioned by tran&s;planting a Tooth." This was in&s;erted in the <HI>Medical Tran&s;actions;</HI> and this, I believe, was the la&s;t paper he wrote<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">P. 325-338.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1786, he had the honour of knight|hood conferred upon him; being one of the body deputed by the College to congratu|late his Maje&s;ty on his e&s;cape from a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation.</P>
<P>In general, Sir <HI>William</HI> WATSON enjoyed a firm &s;tate of health. It was &s;ometimes interrupted by fits of the gout; but the&s;e &s;eldom confined him long to the hou&s;e. In
<PB N="334" REF="341">
the year 1786, the decline of his health was very vi&s;ible to his friends, and his &s;trength was greatly dimini&s;hed, together with much of that vivacity which &s;o &s;trongly marked his character. He died May 10, 1787.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> WATSON had a natural ac|tivity both of mind and body, that never allowed him to be indolent in the &s;lighte&s;t degree. He was a mo&s;t exact oeconomi&s;t of his time, and throughout life a very early ri&s;er, being up u&s;ually in &s;ummer at &s;ix o'clock, and frequently &s;ooner; thus &s;ecur|ing to him&s;elf daily two or three uninter|rupted hours for &s;tudy. In his younger days, the&s;e early hours, as I have before ob&s;erved, were frequently given up to the purpo&s;es of &s;impling; but, in riper years, they were devoted to &s;tudy. He read much and carefully; and his ardent and unremit|ting de&s;ire to be acquainted with the pro|gre&s;s of all tho&s;e &s;ciences which were his objects, joined to a vigorous and retentive memory, enabled him to trea&s;ure up a va&s;t &s;tock of knowledge. What he thus ac|quired, he freely di&s;pen&s;ed. His mode of conveying information was clear, forcible,
<PB N="335" REF="342">
and energetic, and ju&s;tified the encomium be&s;towed upon him by a learned foreigner, in a letter to a corre&s;pondent<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">WATSONIUS <HI>Botanicus et Phy&s;icus clarus e&s;t et per&s;picax homo, itidemque humani&s;&s;imus.</HI> M. Meckel, of <HI>Berlin,</HI> in Epi&s;tolis ad HALLERUM <HI>datis.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>His attention, however, was by no means confined to the &s;ubjects of his own profe&s;|&s;ion, or tho&s;e of philo&s;ophy at large. He was a careful ob&s;erver of men, and of the manners of the age; and the extraordinary endowment of his memory had furni&s;hed him with a great variety of intere&s;ting and entertaining anecdotes, concerning the cha|racters and circum&s;tances of his time<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">It is to Sir <HI>William</HI> WATSON that we owe the pre|fervation of an anecdote, which tends further to illu&s;trate the character, and exalt the &s;incerity and integrity of the excellent Mr. ADDISON.

<P>On all &s;ubjects, his liberal and commu|nicative di&s;po&s;ition, and his courteous be|haviour, encouraged enquiry; and tho&s;e who &s;ought for information from him, &s;el|dom
<PB N="336" REF="343">
departed without it. In his epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence he was copious and preci&s;e; and &s;uch as enjoyed the privilege and plea|&s;ure of it, experienced in his punctuality another qualification which greatly en|hanced its value.</P>
<P>Some of the fir&s;t of Sir <HI>William</HI> WAT|SON's papers in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;ac|tions,</HI> evince his early proficiency in the &s;cience of Botany, and e&s;pecially his ac|quaintance with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;pecies: nor was he le&s;s &s;killed in exotics in his riper years. That he was very &s;oon con&s;idered on the continent as highly re&s;pectable in this light, is manife&s;t from his having been one of the few in <HI>England,</HI> whom Mr. CLIFFORD gratified with a copy of the <HI>Hortus Clif|fortianus;</HI> a work, at its fir&s;t publication, only attainable by tho&s;e who&s;e &s;tudies and acquirements in the &s;ubject of it, entitled them to receive it from the munificence of Mr. CLIFFORD him&s;elf. In fact, all learn|ed foreigners, of the &s;ame bias in their &s;tu|dies, brought letters of recommendation to him; and, on their return, failed not, both in their corre&s;pondence and in their wri|tings,
<PB N="337" REF="344">
to bear honourable te&s;timony to his learning and abilities.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> WATSON had learned to know plants by the &s;y&s;tem and nomencla|ture of RAY, when <HI>trivial</HI> names were unknown; and he was &s;o &s;ingularly happy in a tenacious memory, as to be able to repeat, with wonderful promptitude, the long names which had been in u&s;e from the times of BAUHINE, GERARD, and PARKINSON; a ta&s;k from which botani&s;ts are relieved, by the introduction of the <HI>Linnaean trivial</HI> epithets. He lived to &s;ee the &s;y&s;tem of his much-honoured country|man give way to that of the <HI>Swede,</HI> which began to take place in <HI>England</HI> about this period; and with which al&s;o he made him|&s;elf acquainted. His knowledge of plants, and the hi&s;tory of them in the various au|thors, was &s;o eminently exten&s;ive, that his opinion was frequently appealed to as deci|&s;ive on the &s;ubject; and by &s;ome of his in|timate friends he was u&s;ually called <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The living Lexicon of Botany."</Q> Had it been the lot of Sir <HI>William</HI> WATSON to have been devoted to Botany as an official em|ployment;
<PB N="338" REF="345">
or had the more important avocations of his profe&s;&s;ion allowed a fur|ther indulgence to his favourite bias, &s;uch an union of natural endowments and ac|quired knowledge as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, mu&s;t have placed him very high among the na|turali&s;ts of this age.</P>
<P>It remains for me to do ju&s;tice to the worth of Sir <HI>William</HI> WATSON as a phy|&s;ician, and as a member of &s;ociety. But as the&s;e parts of his character have been already delineated with great truth and di&s;|crimination by my much-re&s;pected friend Dr. GARTHSHORE, I &s;hall conclude this account by &s;ome extracts from the Memo|rial read by him to a &s;ociety of phy&s;icians, of which Sir <HI>William</HI> had been the pre&s;i|dent.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>LINNAEUS.</HEAD>
<P>AS I am now arrived beyond the pe|riod, when the name of LINNAEUS began to be celebrated throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> it will be nece&s;&s;ary to recur to the circum|&s;tances of his vi&s;it to this country, that the introduction and full e&s;tabli&s;hment of his &s;y&s;tem in this kingdom, may be better illu&s;trated. Here, had his reception been
<PB N="342" REF="349">
more encouraging to his wi&s;hes, it has been &s;aid, he was di&s;po&s;ed to have taken up his re&s;idence. He had been &s;ome time in <HI>Hol|land,</HI> under the patronage, and in the hou&s;e, of Mr. CLIFFORD. He had taken his de|gree of doctor in phy&s;ic. He had gained the e&s;teem of BOERHAAVE, and from him brought letters of recommendation to the literati of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The fame of Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE and his Mu&s;eum, and the e&s;teem in which LIN|NAEUS held the character of DILLENIUS, added to the de&s;ire of in&s;pecting the <HI>She|rardian Pinax,</HI> were among the mo&s;t power|ful motives that induced the <HI>Swede</HI> to vi&s;it <HI>England.</HI> This event took place in the &s;pring of 1736. I am only able to a&s;cer|tain the &s;ea&s;on of the year, from being in|formed of the plea&s;ure he expre&s;&s;ed, in meeting in the fields with tho&s;e produc|tions of <HI>England,</HI> that are not &s;pontaneou&s;ly growing in <HI>Sweden.</HI> His delight particu|larly, in &s;eeing under the hedges the <HI>Hya|cinth</HI> in full flower, can only be conceived by tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome &s;hare of that bo|tanical ardour which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="350">
At this time, the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem exi&s;ted only in its outline. Enough of it, how|ever, was manife&s;ted in the <HI>Florula Lap|ponica,</HI> printed in the <HI>Acta Up&s;alien&s;ia,</HI> for the years 1732 and 1733, and in the fir&s;t &s;ketch of the <HI>Sy&s;tema,</HI> in 1735, to exhibit its novelty. I know not that the <HI>Funda|menta Botanica,</HI> the <HI>Bibliotheca,</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;a Cliffortiana,</HI> although they bear date in 1736, had reached <HI>England</HI> before the author: yet, notwith&s;tanding the warm recommendation of BOERHAAVE, Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, con&s;idered at that time as the <HI>Mecaenas</HI> of Botany in this i&s;land, gave the author, and his &s;y&s;tem, an unfavourable reception. At the age of &s;eventy-&s;ix, we need not be &s;urpri&s;ed that the veteran &s;hould not feel di&s;po&s;ed to learn a new &s;y&s;tem, from a young man, whom he could not but con&s;ider as an adventurer, both in fortune, in fame, and in &s;cience. SLOANE, more|over, had never paid &s;ufficient attention to the improvement of &s;cience in the con|&s;truction of generical characters; and this circum&s;tance, probably, &s;et him at a far|ther di&s;tance from embracing the &s;y&s;tem of
<PB N="344" REF="351">
LINNAEUS, which exhibited an arrange|ment &s;o widely different from the unde|fined a&s;&s;emblage of the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Ja|maica.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t not however be under&s;tood, that Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE remained in&s;en&s;ible to the genius and accompli&s;hments of LIN|NAEUS: on the contrary, when he after|wards &s;ent him his <HI>Flora Lapponica,</HI> Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE wrote him a letter, bearing date Dec. 20, 1737, expre&s;&s;ive of the great plea&s;ure he received in the peru&s;al of it; exhorting him to elucidate the remaining parts of the natural hi&s;tory of his country, on the &s;ame plan.</P>
<P>DILLENIUS was highly &s;en&s;ible of his merit, and gave him the mo&s;t polite recep|tion. But that he who had been &s;o long ver&s;ed in the &s;y&s;tems of TOURNEFORT and RAY, and after having given improvement to the latter, by which he had de&s;erved and received the applau&s;e, not of <HI>England</HI> alone, but of all <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;hould abandon that &s;y&s;|tem, to embrace the hitherto uncounte|nanced novelties of LINNAEUS, could not rea&s;onably be expected.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="352">
The journey into <HI>England</HI> however, was, on the whole, highly gratifying to LIN|NAEUS. He beheld with a&s;toni&s;hment the collections of SLOANE, and, with rapture, the <HI>Herbaria</HI> of PETIVER, PLUKENET, BU|DELLE, and of many others there repo&s;it|ed, who&s;e names were familiar to him. At <HI>Oxford</HI> he in&s;pected, with no le&s;s &s;atisfac|tion, the <HI>Pinax</HI> of SHERARD, which he had eagerly wi&s;hed to &s;ee publi&s;hed, and of which DILLENIUS had compleated about a fourth part. But an undertaking of that nature and extent, after the death of the fir&s;t projector of it, demanded a patronage and an expence, not ea&s;ily obtained.</P>
<P>About the time LINNAEUS made his tour into this country, indigenous botany was on the whole in a langui&s;hing &s;tate. It no longer felt that degree of &s;upport, which the SHERARDS, and Sir HANS, had afford|ed it. The Con&s;ul was dead; and the de|clining years of Dr. <HI>James</HI> SHERARD, and of Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, began to withdraw them from the bu&s;tle, and almo&s;t from the bu&s;ine&s;s, of life. After the publication of RAY's <HI>Synop&s;is</HI> by DILLENIUS, in 1724,
<PB N="346" REF="353">
no work of magnitude on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> bota|ny, except the <HI>Hi&s;toria Mu&s;corum,</HI> in 1741, took place for many years; not that there were wanting &s;everal individuals, who were eminent for their knowledge of indigenous botany, and zealous in propagating it: as in&s;tances, I refer to the names of WATSON, COLLINSON, MILLER, and BLACKSTONE. The arrival however of LINNAEUS in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and the con&s;equent promulgation of his method, excited that curio&s;ity which novelty will ever attract, and, although his &s;y&s;tem might be but little reli&s;hed at the in&s;tant, by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> naturali&s;ts in gene|ral, there were yet a few into who&s;e minds his doctrines &s;ilently in&s;inuated them&s;elves, and gained approbation.</P>
<P>In the year 1737, the next after LIN|NAEUS left <HI>England,</HI> he publi&s;hed the <HI>Ge|nera Plantarum,</HI> which compleatly un|folded the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem, as far as related to cla&s;&s;ical and generical characters; and in the &s;ame year exemplified it in the &s;pecies, by the <HI>Flora Lapponica,</HI> and the <HI>Hortus Cliffortianus.</HI> At the &s;ame time, anxious as it &s;hould &s;eem above all, to gain the ap|probation
<PB N="347" REF="354">
of DILLENIUS, he dedicated to him the <HI>Critica Botanica;</HI> in which he ex|plains his rea&s;ons for the change of names, and for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of new di&s;tinc|tions, both of which, he well knew, would be con&s;idered as dangerous innovations.</P>
<P>The&s;e volumes &s;oon found their way into the libraries of the curious in <HI>England;</HI> though the <HI>Hortus Cliffortianus</HI> was, at fir&s;t, only di&s;per&s;ed through the munificence of Mr. CLIFFORD. The &s;implicity of the cla&s;&s;ical characters as the ba&s;is, the uni|formity of the generical notes, confined wholly to the parts of fructification, and that preci&s;ion which marked the &s;pecific di&s;tinctions, advantages, of which all fore|going &s;y&s;tems were de&s;titute, &s;oon com|manded the a&s;&s;ent of the unprejudiced; and an interval of a few years, gave LINNAEUS's method a decided &s;uperiority with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botani&s;ts.</P>
<P>After the e&s;tabli&s;hment of LINNAEUS in the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip in the year 1741, the pub|lication of the <HI>The&s;es,</HI> afterwards, in a col|lected form, called the <HI>Amoenitates Acade|micae,</HI> commenced, and, in le&s;s than ten
<PB N="348" REF="355">
years, two volumes had been publi&s;hed. The&s;e tracts, by the variety of u&s;eful and entertaining knowledge, with which they abound, equally extended and augmented the reputation of LINNAEUS. They con|vinced his oppo&s;ers, that his knowledge was not bounded by mere nomenclature, and &s;y&s;tematic arrangement, as was re|proachfully objected.</P>

tran&s;mitted to the Royal Society, and excited much attention among tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ed &s;tudents, and lovers of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botany, who obtained the peru&s;al of it.</P>
<P>In 1756, Dr. BROWNE cla&s;&s;ed all his <HI>Jamaica</HI> plants, amounting to 1200 &s;pecies, in the &s;ame method. The drawings having been made by EHRET, had the advantage of &s;eparate delineations of the flower and fruit.</P>
<P>In 1759, Mr. STILLINGFLEET pub|li&s;hed a Tran&s;lation of &s;everal Tracts from the <HI>Amoenitates;</HI> and, by his own valuable additions, his in&s;tructive Preface, the judi|cious and learned notes inter&s;per&s;ed through|out the book, by his own "Calendar of Flora," confirming and illu&s;trating that of the <HI>Swede,</HI> greatly conduced to exalt the reputation of LINNAEUS in <HI>England.</HI> Of this learned and excellent man, the reader will find &s;ome memoirs in the <HI>Gentleman's Magazine</HI> for 1776, which were afterwards incorporated into "Anecdotes of Mr. <HI>Bow|yer</HI>" (&s;ee p. 300), and into the <HI>Biogra|phia Dramatica,</HI> 2d edition, 1782.</P>
<P>The next year, Mr. LEE, by his Tran&s;|lation
<PB N="350" REF="357">
of the <HI>Elements</HI> of the Sexual Sy&s;tem, much contributed to facilitate the know|ledge, and extend the progre&s;s and popu|larity of it, among the le&s;s learned of his countrymen, or &s;uch as were unable to re|cur to the <HI>Fundamenta,</HI> or <HI>Philo&s;ophia Bo|tanica</HI> of the author.</P>
<P>At this juncture, it is material among tho&s;e circum&s;tances which accelerated the progre&s;s of the new &s;y&s;tem, to mention the arrival of the late much-lamented Dr. SO|LANDER, who came into <HI>England</HI> on the fir&s;t of July, 1760. His name, and the connexion he was known to bear as the favourite pupil of his great ma&s;ter, had of them&s;elves &s;ome &s;hare in exciting a curio|&s;ity which led to information; whil&s;t his perfect acquaintance with the whole &s;cheme enabled him to explain its minute&s;t parts, and elucidate all tho&s;e ob&s;curities with which, on a &s;uperficial view it was thought to be enveloped. I add to this, that the urbanity of his manners, and his readine&s;s to afford every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power, joined to that clearne&s;s and energy with which he effected it, not only brought
<PB N="351" REF="358">
conviction of its excellence in tho&s;e who were inclined to receive it, but conciliated the minds, and di&s;pelled the prejudices, of many who had been aver&s;e to it.</P>
<P>By all the&s;e preliminary advances, the learned were prepared to &s;ee the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botany modelled according to the rules of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;chool. Dr. HILL &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity of attempting it, in his <HI>Flora Britannica,</HI> 1760; but it was execu|ted in a manner &s;o unworthy of his abili|ties, that his work can have no claim to the merit of having an&s;wered the occa&s;ion: and thus the credit of the atchievement fell to the lot of Mr. <HI>William</HI> HUDSON, F.R.S. who, to an exten&s;ive knowledge of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plants, acquired by an attention to nature, had, by his re&s;idence in the <HI>Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum,</HI> all the auxiliary re&s;ources that could favour his de&s;ign: acce&s;s particularly to the <HI>Her|baria</HI> of almo&s;t all the a&s;&s;i&s;tants of RAY and DILLENIUS, mentioned in the <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> gave him the opportunity of comparing the individual &s;pecimens of that work with his own; and thus enabled him to di&s;pel a multitude of doubts and uncertainties, in
<PB N="352" REF="359">
which, otherwi&s;e, his application of the <HI>&s;y|nonyma</HI> might have been involved.</P>
<P>The &s;exual &s;y&s;tem was received nearly about the &s;ame time in the univer&s;ities of <HI>Britain;</HI> being publicly taught by Mr. Profe&s;&s;or MARTYN, at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and by Dr. HOPE, at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> The adoption of it by the&s;e learned Profe&s;&s;ors, I con&s;ider, therefore, as the aera of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;y&s;tem in <HI>Britain</HI>&mdash;a &s;y&s;tem, which, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, had given the author of it a literary domi|nion over the vegetable kingdom; which, in the rapidity of its exten&s;ion, and the &s;trength of its influence, had not perhaps been paralleled in the annals of &s;cience.</P>
