<HEAD>TO THE PUBLICK.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader will perceive at fir&s;t &s;ight that the hint of this piece is borrowed from an Italian Opera, entitled, <HI>Il Filofofo di Campagna.</HI> There is al&s;o a circum&s;tance from Moliere, which, except about twenty lines taken from different publications, and thrown occa&s;ionally into the &s;ongs, are the only pa&s;|&s;ages in it that have ever appeared either on the &s;tage, or in print.</P>
<P>Indeed con&s;cious of my own inability, I &s;hould have collected all the materials, had it been practicable; but attempting this with|out &s;ucce&s;s, and being unwilling to throw away a &s;ubject than which 'tis hardly po&s;&s;ible to conceive any thing more operatical, I de|termined to make a tryal of what I could do to it my&s;elf, and this in no re&s;pect with a view of &s;etting my&s;elf up for an author, but merely from a de&s;ire of a&s;&s;i&s;ting my reputa|tion as a mu&s;ician.</P>
<P>And now I &s;hould very little de&s;erve the
<PB N="ii" REF="5">
pains they have taken for me, if I did not in the warme&s;t manner acknowledge my ob|ligations to the performers, to who&s;e merit I am convinced I owe a con&s;iderable &s;hare of that applau&s;e the WEDDING RING has been favoured with.</P>
<P>I have little more to &s;ay concerning the piece. The dialogue is given for nothing more than &s;uch as would immediately ari&s;e from the &s;ituations; and if the &s;ongs are found to be irregular, I would beg leave to remark, that they were written &s;o (the comic ones e&s;pecially) on purpo&s;e, it being very often nece&s;&s;ary, that the mea&s;ure &s;hould halt in order to give a novelty to the expre&s;&s;ion of the mu&s;ick. And having &s;aid thus much, &s;uch as it is, I take the liberty of &s;ubmitting this trifle to the public; to that public to whom I have &s;uch infinite obligations, who&s;e humanity and genero&s;ity I have &s;o lately ex|perienced, and to who&s;e amu&s;ement it will always be my greate&s;t pride, that I have the honour of endeavouring to contribute.</P>

<P>Sir, I won't hear a &s;ingle word more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are your objections?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I &s;hall keep my objections to my&s;elf, and you mu&s;t and &s;hall be &s;atisfied with my refu|&s;ing you without telling you why.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was ever any thing to unrea&s;onable. But, Sir, if it &s;hould &s;o happen, that the lady is not aver&s;e to my propo&s;al, would you &s;till per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, if you &s;tay till you get her con|&s;ent, your patience will be pretty well exercis'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you promi&s;e me your's, Sir, upon condition that I am &s;o fortunate to &s;ucceed with her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, with all my heart; I believe I may very &s;ecurely make that promi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am the happie&s;t man in the world!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then you really have the mode&s;ty to imagine it practicable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes, Sir, I confe&s;s I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, know to your confu&s;ion, that &s;he has given her con&s;ent to another, and that &s;he wears on her finger, at this minute, a WEDDING RING, in token of her having promi&s;ed to marry him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;ince it is &s;o, will you, as the
<PB N="22" REF="28">
la&s;t reque&s;t I have to make you, allow me to hear a confirmation of this from your daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, then you don't believe me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't ab&s;olutely &s;ay that; but it would be a &s;atisfaction to me, I confe&s;s, to hear it from the young lady her&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, you &s;hall have that &s;atisfaction in a minute, for here &s;he comes.&mdash;Felicia, here's a &s;trange importunate &s;ort of a gentleman, who has the audacity to expect my con&s;ent to his mar|riage with you; I told him of the promi&s;e you made me, and nothing, for&s;ooth, will &s;atisfy him but hearing it from your mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, what I heard from your father might well &s;urpri&s;e me, I was in doubt, I own; and that final &s;entence, which determines the fate of my unbounded pa&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be &s;o &s;en|&s;ibly felt by me, that it can be no offence if I de&s;ire a repetition of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I'd have it known, that fate has pre|&s;ented two objects to my view, which in&s;piring me with different &s;entiments, agitate all the pa&s;&s;ions of my &s;oul, one, by a rea&s;onable choice whereto honour engages me&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>And your father's con&s;ent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all my e&s;teem and love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's my choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the other, in return for his affection, has all my anger and aver&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>To &s;ee my&s;elf the wife of one is all my de&s;ire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's my good girl.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, are you contented?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, he mu&s;t be contented, and if he has the love for me, he pretends, he ought not to re|pine at his fate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ma'am, &s;o far from repining, I admire your &s;incerity, and &s;hall endeavour to behave in this affair as I ought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know, 'tis highly improper for young women to own their love &s;o freely; but in the con|dition fate has plac'd me, the&s;e liberties may be allow'd, and I can without a blu&s;h confe&s;s, that I have declared my real &s;entiments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Ma'am, your meaning's plain enough, I under&s;tand what 'tis you urge me too, and &s;hall remove from your &s;ight him who gives you this great di&s;turbance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can't oblige me more agreeably.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor young man&mdash;a very great proof of his affection indeed&mdash;rather than make you un|happy, he bears his own torments without &s;eeming to &s;uffer any, truly I pity him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, it's more than I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but that's too cruel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you, if you knew, what my &s;entiments are of him, you would not think him &s;uch an object of pity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but con&s;ider, he had an affection for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Li&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Sir, in my opinion, &s;he ought to follow your advice, and not treat him with &s;o much ill-nature.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>We don't want you, Ma'am, to give your opinion about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Li&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir, you won't be plea&s;ed let one talk how one will; did not you &s;ay, my young lady treated him too cruelly? and would not any body in the world &s;ay the &s;ame? is there any com|pari&s;on now between him and Signor Zerbino? Oh, Ma'am, your father is perfectly in the right; &s;hew more compa&s;&s;ion to Henrico by all means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who the devil gave you the liberty of advi&s;ing my daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Li&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, Sir, there's no harm in &s;peaking one's mind; I have &s;aid no more than what I actually think of the matter, and you can't do better than fir&s;t of all to marry your daughter to Henrico, and afterwards, as a reward for my faithful &s;ervices, prevail upon Zerbino to marry me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="31">
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard &s;uch a piece of impudence &s;ince I was born, but I am angry with my&s;elf for li&s;tening to it. Felicia, I am going to &s;ee that Zerbino makes all the nece&s;&s;ary preparations, and &s;hall be with you again in half an hour.</P>

<P>Oh, Ma'am, If you don't exert a little &s;pi|rit we are undone: I have taken care to appri&s;e Henrico of all that's going forward; and poor Zerbino&mdash;if he does not repent his gallantry&mdash;I have &s;uch a battery to play off again&s;t him; nay, I'll make both him and your father principal actors in this plot of ours, even without their knowledge.</P>
