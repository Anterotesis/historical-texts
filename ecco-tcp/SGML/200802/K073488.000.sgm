<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following pages, the pro|duction of a candid, though unculti|vated mind, &s;hew how much it is in the power of natural &s;implicity and good &s;en&s;e to make their way to the heart, without the le&s;&s;ons of the &s;chools, and the aid of artificial compo&s;ition. The author relates the cata&s;trophe of his family, the various accidents that befel him&s;elf, and the ob&s;ervations which he had occa&s;ion to make on a great variety of places, objects, and characters, with an air of truth and &s;incerity; which gains a more ready
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
and firmer belief, and takes fa&s;ter hold of the mind and heart, than narratives &s;ea&s;oned with profound reflections, and compo&s;ed with the greate&s;t care and artifice. He never, as he hone&s;tly de|clares, <Q REND="inline">"takes his own part."</Q> He &s;eems always to &s;peak from the bottom of his &s;oul; he confe&s;&s;es, on every oc|ca&s;ion, his own weakne&s;s or folly. The &s;imple &s;trokes of truth and nature with which he paints the caprices, the vanities, and vices of others, po&s;&s;e&s;s all the force of &s;atyr; and the atten|tive and enlightened reader finds a gra|tification in ob&s;erving how objects &s;trike a &s;ound and &s;en&s;ible mind, free from all &s;y&s;tem and prejudice of edu|cation; for our untutored traveller, ca&s;t
<PB N="v" REF="4">
on the wide world, an orphan of only five years of age, learned to read and write, and ca&s;t up accounts, merely by his own application and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Placed in a va&s;t variety of &s;ituations and departments, in the &s;ervice of a great variety of per&s;ons of rank and fortune, he had an opportunity of con|templating both high and low life, of becoming acquainted with the ways of the world, and of trea&s;uring up, as he has done in the journal of his life, many anecdotes and remarks in|tere&s;ting and u&s;eful both to ma&s;ters and &s;ervants.&mdash;If JOHN MACDONALD po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es not the learning and the wit of
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
GIL BLAS, he draws more from truth and nature; and he has had, though in a humbler &s;phere, almo&s;t as many adventures. Another circum&s;tance, not to be omitted in an apology for the publication of the&s;e travels, is, that their Author, mindful of the helple&s;s &s;tate of his infancy, embraces every occa&s;ion of illu&s;trating the beneficence of an all-ruling Providence. This, indeed, may be con&s;idered as forming, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the principle by which he connects the various inci|dents of his life.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the remarks of the Editor, to whom Mr. MACDONALD committed
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
his manu&s;cript for the purpo&s;e of cor|recting and improving his &s;tyle; but who judged it unnece&s;&s;ary, and even improper, to make any other alterations therein, than a few that &s;eemed here and there nece&s;&s;ary, in order to render it intelligible.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE AND TRAVELS OF <HI>JOHN MACDONALD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was formerly cu&s;tomary for the younger &s;ons of gentlemen's families, in Scotland, that did not go into the navy or army, to become graziers. My father, who had no e&s;tate of his own, rented near a thou&s;and acres of the Laird of Grant. He reared cattle, and drove them to the South of Scotland, and into England, where he &s;old them. He married, at the age of twenty, a daughter of &s;ome
<PB N="2" REF="8">
family of the name of Mackay: but I never knew any thing of her family. My mother bore a daughter to him, and four &s;ons: but he, being a rover in di&s;po&s;ition, and always hankering after the army, addicted him&s;elf to the u&s;e of the broad-&s;word, in which he excelled; and being very hot and quarrel&s;ome, challenged and fought many gentlemen with the &s;word and target, which affronted many families in the neighbourhood, and broke my mother's heart.</P>
<P>I was born in the beginning of the year 1741; and, about two years after, my mother had another &s;on, of whom &s;he died in child|bed. On this my father was almo&s;t di&s;tract|ed, &s;wore he would never marry another wo|man, and &s;aid often to the children, Thy mother I &s;hall never forget. Then he turn|ed extravagant, did not &s;tay at home &s;o much as he &s;hould have done, but neglected his bu&s;ine&s;s; and when the Rebellion began, in
<PB N="3" REF="9">
1745, he rai&s;ed a number of men of his own name, whom he employed as his drovers, and marched them up to Prince Charles, who&s;e fir&s;t camp was about twenty miles off my father's hou&s;e. The Prince received him very kindly, and made him a captain of the Macdonald's clan. He then left his bu&s;ine&s;s to the grieve, or foreman, and very &s;eldom came home. He was in all the battles that en&s;ued in Scotland, till he fell at Culloden. Having thus given an account of my parentage, I &s;hall go on with perfect impartiality; and, without taking my own part, to relate every thing that I did, or &s;uffered, whether good or bad.</P>
<P>The Laird of Grant, thinking things would go wrong with Prince Charles, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what cattle was left, and put a per&s;on in the hou&s;e in his name, which indeed &s;aved it afterwards from the flames, when the rebels hor&s;es were burnt in their
<PB N="4" REF="10">
&s;tables. The man that had the charge of my father's affairs, went with the cattle, and had a place at the Laird of Grant's. His name was Boyd. He took my elde&s;t bro|ther, as he had a great regard for the boy, and the boy for him, and then we four were left with the maid, who took no care of the hou&s;e, or any little things that were left, as &s;he never expected any wages, but &s;oon went off with a lover. We were now left alone: but my &s;i&s;ter being, by the pro|vidence of God, bold, of an heroic di&s;po&s;i|tion, and &s;trong withal, was prepared to go through the following hard&s;hips.&mdash;Boyd, having read a letter dated from my father, Cap|tain Macdonald, at Goolen's Inn and Livery Stables, Head of the Canongate, Edinburgh, an an&s;wer was returned; but I believe all the letters to Prince Charles's camp were in|tercepted, for we never &s;aw or heard from our father more.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="11">
After the letter came from our father, my &s;i&s;ter was never ea&s;y; but going from one town to another, on foot, &s;ometimes to Inverne&s;s, then to &s;ee my brother, out and in, to and fro. This made the people take notice, and &s;ay, &s;he had &s;omething ex|traordinary to go through. Now we had no per&s;on with us in the hou&s;e; but the neighbours came to &s;ee us now and then. My &s;i&s;ter had it in her head to go to Edinburgh, to &s;ee my father. She got all the money &s;he could get together, which was fourteen pounds Scots, or twenty|three &s;hillings and four-pence Engli&s;h. With this, the letter from my father in her bo&s;om, and her three brothers in her hand, out &s;he &s;ets for Edinburgh, from the pari&s;h of Urquhart, about the middle of September, 1745. Now our ages were as follows: Kitty, fourteen; Duncan, that was left with Boyd, between ten and eleven; Daniel, &s;even; I, four and a half; and my
<PB N="6" REF="12">
brother, Alexander, two years and a half. She cho&s;e for her departure a moon-light night, that the people &s;hould not &s;top her; and &s;o &s;he got into Inverne&s;s about breakfa&s;t, having travelled nine miles. My &s;i&s;ter car|ried the child on her back, Daniel carried the bundle, and I ran along &s;ide of both. In this manner we travelled from Inverne&s;s to Edinburgh, which is one hundred and fifty mea&s;ured miles, in the &s;pace of two months.</P>
<P>Now you &s;hall &s;ee the providence of God towards helple&s;s orphans, that are left to his care alone. As we travelled, we were the &s;urpri&s;e of every one, as we were &s;o young. Our money being expended, we were obliged to beg our bread. We were kindly u&s;ed by &s;ome, and har&s;hly by others that were again&s;t the Prince. One kind wo|man equipt us with a little bag for oatmeal: for people that would not take us in, would
<PB N="7" REF="13">
give us a handful of meal. She gave us a round wooden di&s;h al&s;o, which my &s;i&s;ter put our pottage in, when &s;he met with good people that would let her bake it, or bake cakes of oatmeal on their gridiron. The chief of our food was pottage and milk, or cakes and milk; and &s;ometimes, if we met with good friends at a farm-hou&s;e, we got a bit of meat. If it rained, we waited at a farm-hou&s;e &s;ometimes for two or three days. On the journey we had two things to recommend us, although begging from hou&s;e to hou&s;e: the things we had on were all plaid, and of the fine&s;t kind; for an extravagant father cares not what he buys. Our ap|parel looked like that of a gentleman's chil|dren, and we had a great &s;hare of beauty. Oftentimes, where we came, folks would fay, Poor dears! they certainly are &s;ome gentle|man's children. Others, what if they are a gentleman's ba&s;tards? &s;o, as God knows all things that are to happen, if he takes one
<PB N="8" REF="14">
thing, he gives another; and he has promi&s;ed to take care of fatherle&s;s and motherle&s;s chil|dren: For nothing can happen without God's knowledge. We never marched when it rained, if it had been two or three days: and, on a fine &s;un&s;hining day, we play|ed on the road till near night, when we con|tinued to &s;huffle forward. If we could not reach a hou&s;e, my &s;i&s;ter would cover us with our plaids, and cut the tops of brooms with her knife to lay on and cover our plaids. In this manner we lay at nights for weeks, and always &s;et off in the morn|ing. When we had any brook to cro&s;s, or &s;mall river, my &s;i&s;ter would carry over my young brother, then come for me, and afterwards come back to take my brother's hand. One time, as &s;he was wading a river with Alexander, when &s;he came near the other &s;ide, the water overpowered her, and carried her and my brother into a whirl|pool, where they floated, till a man, who
<PB N="9" REF="15">
was digging potatoes at a little di&s;tance, &s;aw her di&s;tre&s;s, and ran to her relief. He took her and the boy out of the pool, and carried my brother and me over al&s;o. He then took us to a farm-hou&s;e, where we had victuals and drink, and our cloaths dried; and at night we we were put into a barn among&s;t the &s;traw. If at any time we happened to be benighted, and could not get quarters, we &s;ometimes lay in an old hou&s;e without a roof or any hou&s;e near it; another time, if the weather was fine, near the road &s;ide, among&s;t &s;ome fine broom. One day, in the morning, before we got up, a luna|tic, who was coming along, heard us &s;peak; he drew a&s;ide, and &s;tood over us for &s;ome time: he never &s;poke but &s;eemed amazed. He then ran away as if he had been afraid, and we were very glad. My &s;i&s;ter next night was told that he was out of his mind for love. A gentleman in the country gave him every year a &s;uit of cloaths; he went
<PB N="10" REF="16">
where he liked; he would work &s;ometimes well, and, when the work was over, they would take &s;ome method to affront him, that he might &s;et off in a pet without a&s;king for any wages. This they did not con&s;ider as any act of inju&s;tice: for, if he got any money, he would hide it under a &s;tone, and forget where he laid it; &s;o that the money was lo&s;t to the pub|lic. One time he worked with a farmer for the whole time of hay and harve&s;t; when the &s;ea&s;on of his labours was over, the butcher came one night with his cord, his knife, and &s;teel, felt his neck and loins, told the farmer he was fat enough, and that he might be killed in the morning; but be|fore morning he was gone many miles. He often told afterwards, how he had deceived the butcher. Many things of this kind we met with, too tedious to be mentioned. When we came near to Dundee, not far from the town, on the &s;ide of a river, there was an old ca&s;tle where there was a black|&s;mith's
<PB N="11" REF="17">
&s;hop. The black&s;mith's wife was as good a woman as ever lived; &s;he put hay in one of the corners of the ca&s;tle where the rain did not come in, and there at night we lay. In the day we went a begging to Dundee, and at night we came home. She let my &s;i&s;ter dre&s;s our pottage and bake cakes: &s;o we &s;taid here three weeks; after which we &s;et out again on our journey. When it was fine weather, and we came to a rivulet, my &s;i&s;ter wa&s;hed our &s;econd &s;hirt and &s;tockings, for we either had no more at fir&s;t, or el&s;e &s;he did not chu&s;e to bring any more with her. When we came to a river where was a ferry-boat, we begged our pa&s;&s;age over. Then we came to Perth, where we &s;tayed a week or two. The letter from my father was now &s;o worn, with fretting and chaffing, that it was &s;carce legible; but a gentleman made &s;hift to copy it for us afre&s;h. From Perth we travelled to Kinghorn, where we
<PB N="12" REF="18">
&s;taid a few days, till we could get our pa&s;&s;age to Leith. A gentleman, who was a pa&s;|&s;enger in the &s;ame boat with us, paid our fare. Before we left the boat the &s;ame gen|tleman made a collection for us. He rai&s;ed half-a-crown. As we pa&s;&s;ed through Leith we went into an eating-hou&s;e, and had plenty of bread, meat, and broth, for five-pence. In tho&s;e days a working-man could dine well for two-pence. After dinner, we &s;et out for Edinburgh on a fine walk, a mile and an half in length.</P>
<P>Now, my reader, let me tell you, that for what I have wrote hitherto I have been obliged to my &s;i&s;ter; for I was too young to remember it. As we were pa&s;&s;ing onward to Edinburgh by Leith Walk, a country|woman of ours &s;poke to us, and a&s;ked my &s;i&s;ter where we were going, and from whence we came. My &s;i&s;ter told her. She an&s;wer|ed, that Prince Charles was gone from Edin|burgh,
<PB N="13" REF="19">
and all his army with him. On hearing this, we &s;at down and cried: and the woman cried out of pity. Then &s;he took us to Goolen's Inn. Mr. Goolen and every one in the hou&s;e was &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;orry to &s;ee us in &s;uch a &s;ituation. Mr. Goolen gave us &s;ome victuals, and told my &s;i&s;ter he would get us into the workhou&s;e: for he was a very good man, and beloved by every one that knew him. My &s;i&s;ter would not hear of the work|hou&s;e, nor of any confinement, but took us away immediately. We &s;trayed down to|ward the bottom of the Canongate, &s;taring at the &s;igns, coaches, and fine hor&s;es. At the hou&s;e below the Duke of Queen&s;berry's, in the Canongate, a woman, who &s;tood at the door, &s;eeing us &s;trangers, and in the Highland dre&s;s, took us in, and a&s;ked us &s;everal que&s;tions concerning our &s;ituation; which we an&s;wered. She was a widow, and let lodgings; her hu&s;band, before he died, was a ma&s;ter-chairman, of the name of
<PB N="14" REF="20">
Macdonald, born near the place where we were born. The woman let us &s;leep in a lumber garrett on an old matra&s;s, and gave us an old blanket or two. We had a &s;hil|ling left from the collection made for us in the boat, with which we bought provi|&s;ions. Next morning we &s;et out again, and returned at night; and in this manner con|tinued to live for &s;ome time. When we were tired of the town, then we went and begged our way in the country. Some|times we lay in a barn, and at other times in a barn-yard. In &s;uch &s;ituations, my &s;i&s;ter would not let us cough, le&s;t we &s;hould be heard; and we &s;et off early in the morn|ing for fear of being &s;een. In this manner we travelled round the country to Berwick, and to Morpeth in England. We now began to get a little money and old clothes, with other things left off by both boys and girls.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="21">
In the month of April, 1746, we re|turned to Edinburgh, by the Cheviot Hills and Cold&s;tream. We went to Mrs. Mac|donald's as before, and &s;he let us lie in the lumber chamber as u&s;ual. Brother Daniel and I, when we got up one day in the morn|ing, went out to play with the boys, and would not be kept under command by my &s;i&s;ter, who had the young child to take care of; &s;o that, in the day-time, we were &s;eldom together. We went on in this manner for &s;ome time, till an unlucky accident happen|ed, which &s;eparated us all. One day as the Counte&s;s of Murray, who re&s;ided in the Canongate, was returning from an airing with her coach and &s;ix, my &s;i&s;ter and the child on her back, cro&s;&s;ing the &s;treet, were both run over by the carriage. My &s;i&s;ter and bro|ther &s;creaming for fear, and the people calling &s;top, &s;top, made the Counte&s;s faint away. Kitty and Alexander were taken from under the hor&s;es, and, as God would have it, no
<PB N="16" REF="22">
bones were broken. They were both taken into the lady's hou&s;e, and duly taken care of. When they recovered, the boy was put to nur&s;e by Lady Murray: and one Mr. Vernon, an Engli&s;hman, who had been but|ler to Lord Murray, and by him placed in a good office in the Exci&s;e, took my &s;i&s;ter for a &s;ervant, and cloathed her. Thus my &s;i&s;ter and Alexander were both done for. As to Daniel and me, we both of us begged, and played our time away; &s;trolling round the country, and &s;topping &s;ometimes in the barn-yard, and at other times in a barn. In town we lay in the &s;tairs: for about Edinburgh, as in Paris and Madrid, many large families live upon one &s;tair-ca&s;e. They &s;hut their own door, but the &s;treet door is always open. There was an opinion at that time very preva|lent among&s;t us poor children, of whom, after the rebellion, there were a great many, that the doctors came at night to find poor children a&s;leep, and put &s;ticking plai&s;ters to their
<PB N="17" REF="23">
mouth, that they might not call out, and then to take them away to be di&s;&s;ected: and indeed I believe it very true, for what every one &s;ays mu&s;t be true; and the poor High|landers were more de&s;pi&s;ed at that time by the Scots in general, of the other party, than the devils in hell. So when we pa&s;&s;ed the night in a &s;tair, or at a door, one &s;lept and the other kept watch. In our rounds we went to &s;ee our bro|ther, &s;ometimes, at nur&s;e; and one time to &s;ee my &s;i&s;ter: but &s;he wept &s;o much, that Daniel, having more &s;en&s;e than me, &s;aid, after we came away, he would not go again, becau&s;e our being poor and helple&s;s hurt her &s;o much. Another day we went a begging to Mr. Campbell's, a ma&s;ter|carpenter's; and who &s;hould come to the door but one of my father's &s;ervants. The man, on &s;eeing us, was greatly affected, and a &s;cene en&s;ued, which took the atten|tion of many. But nothing touched our
<PB N="18" REF="24">
hearts: we had no &s;orrow, nor the lea&s;t un|ea&s;ine&s;s. One morning we &s;trolled within the gates of the city of Edinburgh, to &s;ee the fine high hou&s;es, and were taken up by the &s;oldiers of the City Guard; for none may beg within the walls of the City; and the &s;oldiers have an allowance for every one they take up. Our names were given to the Captain of the Guard, and entered in a book. Young people that could not find protection were &s;ent abroad in merchant-&s;hips, in a &s;itua|tion little better than that of convicts, though not under the &s;ame di&s;grace.&mdash;Tho&s;e who were kept in the Guard-hou&s;e lived well, by the &s;ide of a good fire, with three rolls and three pints a beer per day. In this comfortable &s;tate we remained for three nights and two days, till the Coun|cil Chamber met. But when the guard &s;oldiers found who we were, they were very &s;orry at what they had done; for they were mo&s;tly all Highlanders, and from
<PB N="19" REF="25">
our &s;hire of Inverne&s;s. They a&s;ked us, if we knew any per&s;on in town? My brother mentioned Mr. Goolen, at the Livery|&s;tables, at the Head of the Canongate.&mdash;This worthy man appeared for us at the Council Chamber before the Lord Provo&s;t, and gave him &s;uch information concerning us, as induced him to &s;et us at liberty. We went with Mr. Goolen; and as there was one of his hou&s;es, next door to his dwelling-hou&s;e, empty, he let us lie at night in a clo&s;et on hay. When we had a mind to go to re&s;t, we got both of us together into a corn-&s;ack. We went out in the day-time, as before, a begging: but at night we had a whole hou&s;e to our|&s;elves like gentlemen. Now Daniel being the olde&s;t, and about the &s;ize of Mr. Goolen's &s;on, his only child, he got his old clothes, and played with the boy, and went on errands, and there remained.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="26">
I was &s;till left to my &s;hifts, and went out, as u&s;ual, to beg and play, for about one year. Sometimes I was de&s;ired to get in the ride, and at other times to ride a hor&s;e to a brook, about a mile out of town; in which employment I very much delighted. At night, when I came home, I lay down at the door of a warehou&s;e, till my brother came to bed. He always brought me &s;omething to eat, and &s;ome halfpence for the next day. One morn|ing, as we were getting up, a woman came into our empty hou&s;e, where &s;he &s;aw a plaid that Mr. Goolen had given to cover us. She a&s;ked if we took that out with us. We &s;aid, No&mdash;never. She went away, and as u&s;ual we left the door on the latch. But &s;he afterwards came and &s;tole our plaid, which contained &s;ix yards. Soon after this the hou&s;e was let. We then &s;lept in the &s;table in the hay-&s;tall.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="27">
About this time, one Mr. Frazer, a ma&s;ter &s;hoe-maker, took me to rock the cradle. I did not like the confinement of this. I pinched the child in the cradle and made it cry. I was turned off accordingly, which was the thing that I wanted. I was now taken into a gentleman's hou&s;e to turn the &s;pit. They gave me &s;tinking veal for dinner&mdash;I put it behind the che&s;t, and &s;et off.</P>
<P>I went next to lead a blind fidler, with whom I lived four months. He taught me to play on the ba&s;s. He carried the one in&s;trument, and I the other on my back.&mdash;One time we went to a wedding in the country, near Ro&s;lin Ca&s;tle. Thither he rode on his a&s;s&mdash;I walked in the middle of the road, and the a&s;s followed.&mdash;We lived well all that day, and my ma&s;ter took thirty &s;hillings. At night we both lay in the barn among&s;t &s;ome hay; but
<PB N="22" REF="28">
we forgot the a&s;s in the field. When the fidler recollected this circum&s;tance, he &s;ent me for him; and when I had brought the creature home, I tied him with his halter to the &s;trong beer cock. In the night the a&s;s drew out the cock, and the beer was &s;pilt. At day-light I &s;aw the place all wet, and told my ma&s;ter what had happened. The fiddler beat me well with the &s;trap of the fiddle-ca&s;e; &s;o, as I had got two &s;hil|lings, at the wedding, in my pocket, I left my ma&s;ter, the a&s;s, and the fiddles, and ran as fa&s;t as I could into Edinburgh. I went next to a farmer's, near Cor&s;torphin, about five miles from Edinburgh. I would not &s;tay in the farmer's two days&mdash;Like Lot's wife I looked back to the city, whither I returned. I now began to leave off Goolen's Lane or Clo&s;e, and found out Gibb's Lane, a little below, about thirty yards di&s;tance.&mdash;Mr. Gibbs kept hackney-coaches and chai&s;es and twenty hor&s;es. I got &s;ome vic|tuals
<PB N="23" REF="29">
and drink from the coachmen and po&s;tillions for doing what they de&s;ired me, and I &s;lept in the large tub in which they mixed the oats and corn for the hor&s;es. In this &s;ituation I continued for &s;ome time. When I left my brother he was taken to &s;leep in Mr. Goolen's hou&s;e. I &s;aw him every day. About this time, one of the coachmen's &s;ons died, and, as I was all tatters, he gave me his cloaths, which fitted me to an hair. When a coachman went into the country with a family, to their country-hou&s;e, I went in the boot and came home with them again. And when I told them, on their a&s;king, who I was, they often gave me &s;ixpence or a &s;hilling, which I &s;pent imme|diately with the coachman and po&s;tillion. I liked this life with all my heart. In October, 1746, my brother Duncan, in the Highlands, hearing that we were about Edinburgh; that our father was killed in the battle of Culloden, which is within
<PB N="24" REF="30">
twenty miles of the place where he lived with Boyd; that every thing belonging to the rebels was de&s;troyed, and their hou&s;es &s;et on fire by the Duke of Cumberland; came to Edinburgh, dre&s;&s;ed very genteely, with two guineas in his pocket: one of which he had received from the Laird of Grant, and the other from Mr. Boyd; for he never ta&s;ted of poverty as we did. When he &s;aw us he was amazed, and grieved to the heart, and thought bad wor&s;e. He &s;topt at Mr. Goolen's with his brother, and paid what he called for. Mr. Goolen a&s;ked him if he would be a ma&s;on? He &s;aid, yes. So in a week he &s;ent him to Falkirk to his brother, a &s;tone-ma&s;on in great bu&s;ine&s;s and credit, with whom he was bound apprentice for &s;even years.</P>
<P>Between this time and the year fifty, I became a po&s;tillion to Mr. Gibb, who &s;et his carpenter to make a bed-frame for me
<PB N="25" REF="31">
over the hay-&s;tall, in one of the &s;tables, and gave me blankets, bedding, and &s;heets, every month. Mr. Gibb was a man of great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. He had a whole lane of hou&s;es, the large&s;t coach-yard in Great-Britain, a garden, and a gardener. He put me in livery, and looked upon me as his apprentice. I was fitted out with a green jacket with a red cape, a red wai&s;tcoat, and a leather cap with the fore-part lined with red morocco. Mr. Gibb was a gentle|man, the &s;on of a gentleman, and dre&s;&s;ed as a gentleman, every day in his ruffles, which is uncommon for men over hor&s;es and carriages, and never drove a coach in his life. The coat of arms he had on his carriage was a hand in hand, within a double trea&s;ure of flowers: his motto, the Gibbs Contract. He married a gentleman's daugh|ter. Her father was the Laird of Craig-Leith. When he was courting his mi&s;tre&s;s, I always drove him in the chai&s;e to &s;ee
<PB N="26" REF="32">
the young lady, and then I lived well. In tho&s;e days genteel families took a coach and &s;ix hor&s;es, as there was no chai&s;e to be hired, but &s;ingle chairs with two wheels, and the &s;econd hor&s;e was often fixed to the left &s;ide to draw it along: &s;o, in returning to town, the coachman would make the po&s;tillion drive the &s;et of hor&s;es; and I was po&s;tillion while the coachman was in the in&s;ide. By this means I learned to drive, and &s;oon became the road-po&s;tillion my&s;elf: in which &s;tation I enjoyed a very plea&s;ant life. When we went into the country with gentlemen's families, to their &s;eats, we had good living on the road; and when we arrived at our journey's end, mo&s;t com|monly noblemen and gentlemen made us &s;tay a day to re&s;t our hor&s;es. My ma&s;ter pitched on me to go into the country be|cau&s;e I was light. When I was put on the hor&s;e I had a &s;trap about my wai&s;t, and fa&s;tened to the crupper of the &s;addle; &s;o
<PB N="27" REF="33">
that if the hor&s;e &s;tumbled I could not pitch over his head. The roads, in tho&s;e days, were very bad. Travelling, of cour&s;e, was not &s;o ea&s;y as it is now. It was therefore thought to be a matter of con&s;equence to have drivers of light weight, and I was the little&s;t po&s;tillion in Scotland or any other country. When I went the Falkirk way, I u&s;ed to &s;ee my brother Duncan the ma&s;on. He was very happy to &s;ee me. He came &s;ometimes to &s;ee us in Edin|burgh. My ma&s;ter, after a &s;hort court&s;hip, married Craig-Leith's daughter: he had fifteen hundred pounds with her. Soon after their marriage, &s;he gave a fea&s;t in my ma&s;ter's own hou&s;e to the black&s;miths, wheelers, harne&s;s-makers, painters, coach|men and po&s;tillions, and helpers, and all their wives and children. My ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s dined with them, and, after dinner, &s;pent the evening abroad: leaving Mr. Gibbs's neice to conduct the entertainment
<PB N="28" REF="34">
at home, with plenty of wine, rum, punch, and ale, and a fidler. Every Monday morn|ing Mrs. Gibbs gave the &s;tablemen a cold joint of meat, and the broken victuals of Sunday, and &s;trong beer. Now every thing was agreeable. My &s;i&s;ter and two brothers were always in town. We &s;aw one another frequently and wanted for nothing. All the others had education. I had none, but learned wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>The year 1750 was a remarkable aera in my life. John Dalrymple, elde&s;t brother of Sir Hugh Dalrymple of North Berwick, Bart. in Ea&s;t Lothian, at the death of Lord Bargeny &s;ucceeded to an e&s;tate of four thou&s;and pounds per year, in right of his mother, a daughter of Lord Bargeny's elde&s;t &s;on; though, as the e&s;tate came by a wo|man, the title was extinct. Mr. Dalrymple now changed his name to Hamilton. After he had been for &s;ome years in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate, and returned from his travels,
<PB N="29" REF="35">
he married Lady Anne Wemys, daughter of the Earl of Wemys, in Fife; by whom he had ten thou&s;and pounds. There was one of the fine&s;t coaches made for Mr. Hamilton, at Mr. Hume's, coach-maker in Edin|burgh, that was in Scotland. When it was ready the coachman was &s;ent for it to town, with the old coach to be left with Mr. Hume. The coachman, in coming to town with the old coach, foun|dered one of the hor&s;es, by giving him cold water when he was hot. So the hor&s;e was unable to work, as the new coach was very heavy, more like a &s;tate-coach than one for the road, and carried al&s;o a large che&s;t of plate. The coachman found that, in order to take the coach to the country-hou&s;e, he mu&s;t have four hor&s;es. He went to &s;everal &s;table-yards, but he could not get black hor&s;es to match his own. They were greys or bays, or not at home. But when he came to my ma&s;ter's, who&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="36">
hor&s;es were all black, he hired three, which with his own made four. And, as one mu&s;t go to bring the hor&s;es back, the coachman pitched on me, as I was light, to ride the &s;ick hor&s;e. So we &s;et out for Bargeny-Hou&s;e, ninety miles di&s;|tant, which, in the condition of the roads at that time, was three days journey. At the town of Ayr, eighteen miles from Bargeny, when the coachman at the Inn, where we &s;taid all night, got in company and was merry with punch, and chattering among&s;t tho&s;e around, he &s;aid I took great care of the &s;ick hor&s;e, which I cer|tainly did: for I got off and walked up all the hills, and, by this time, Jemmy, &s;or that was his name, had got better. And as I plea&s;ed the coachman very well, he hired me to be po&s;tillion for two pounds a year, all my cloaths, and a third part of the vails. Next day, we arrived at Bargeny, in fine weather, near
<PB N="31" REF="37">
the end of April. The coach was admi|red, as well as the plate. I was taken into the parlour, to &s;ee if Lady Anne liked her new po&s;tillion. I was admired in my livery for my littlene&s;s, being only nine years of age. Lady Anne told me to come back again, after I had taken home the hor&s;es. After I had &s;taid two nights, and got the money, I &s;et off with the three hor&s;es. I rode one, and led the other, and the third followed after the other two. I paid for the expences of the hor&s;es, both in going and coming back, after I had got the hire, and took bills from each inn. I took the hor&s;es and money &s;afe home. It was the fir&s;t time I had been out &s;o far by my&s;elf, &s;o I got great applau&s;e. I forgot my being hired, and thought no more of it for a month. As I was coming back, one day, with a chai&s;e and hor&s;es from the Queen's Ferry, I took up two gentlemen to town. They gave me two &s;hillings for the nine
<PB N="32" REF="38">
miles. It happened that my ma&s;ter &s;aw the gentlemen come out of the chai&s;e, and give me two &s;hillings. He knew the gen|tlemen, and a&s;ked how they did. They &s;aid they had an opportunity of his chai&s;e very cheap&mdash;for two &s;hillings: &s;o, in the after|noon, when my ma&s;ter came home, and I had given him the hire to the Queen's Ferry, he a&s;ked me if I had any per&s;on back with me? I &s;aid, No. What did you with the two &s;hillings the gentleman gave you? He &s;earched my pocket, and found the money which I intended to &s;pend at the public-hou&s;e, for that was our cu&s;tom, among&s;t the po&s;tillions. He took and &s;trapped me well, and took all the money in my pocket. I went, on this, to my bro|ther, and told him what had happened, and of my being hired into the country: &s;o, on Sunday morning, he &s;et off with me out of town as far as Fountain Bridge.
<PB N="33" REF="39">
He de&s;ired me to go to Bargeny, gave me two &s;hillings, and returned to Edinburgh.</P>
<P>Now, before I go farther, I &s;hall give a &s;et of men a character they de&s;erve:&mdash;I mean the Hackney-Coachmen in Edin|burgh, who differ from all men in Europe in their &s;tation. There is no &s;tand of coaches in the &s;treet on a Sunday. The po&s;tillions and helpers do the work in the &s;tables, and the coachmen dre&s;s like gentlemen and trade&s;men, and go to church, where they have the fir&s;t &s;eat in the Canongate Church; for all the coach-yards are in the &s;uburbs. No man may drive a coach on the &s;treet till he enters into their corporation, and have the coachman's word and whi&s;tle. By the whi&s;tle they call one another out of any hou&s;e. The coachmen dre&s;s always gen|teelly. The coaches and hor&s;es are like gentlemens. There is only one &s;tand for coaches, and that is in the High-&s;treet,
<PB N="34" REF="40">
one of the fine&s;t in Europe, near the Cro&s;s and the Royal Exchange, where all the noblemen and gentlemen meet between twelve and two, when the mu&s;ical bells are playing. It is a hundred to one but any gentleman in town may be &s;een there at noon. If a coach is wanted on Sunday, it is &s;ent for to the ma&s;ter, and goes out as a day-coach. There is no luggage admitted in a coach there. There was not a coachman in Edinburgh that had le&s;s than forty or fifty hor&s;es. If any noble|man or gentleman wants a coachman, they &s;end for one of them; for they are men of good character: and I have known them refu&s;e a nobleman's &s;ervice. In general they are more re&s;pected than in other countries.</P>
<P>When I parted with my brother, I &s;et off with my po&s;tillion-whip round my &s;houlders, and one &s;hirt in a handkerchief, which was all I had. I ran along about &s;ix
<PB N="35" REF="41">
miles, when I met a helper that lived with my ma&s;ter. He a&s;ked, where I was going? I would not tell him. He took hold of me to take me back&mdash;I roared and cried. He kept hold of me, thinking to get a pre&s;ent for taking me to my ma&s;ter. The people a&s;ked me, if I belonged to that man? I &s;aid I did not; &s;o they took me from him, and I ran fifteen miles to Living&s;ton to dinner: then I ran to the Kirk of Shots, eleven miles, where I &s;tayed all night. I &s;et off in the morning for Hamilton, ten miles: then to Streven; and to New Mills at night, eighteen miles more. I went to all the Inns where the coachmen put up. Next day I went to the city of Ayr, eighteen miles, to the Inn where I was hired, and there &s;topt all night. The landlord went to Madam Duff's, Mr. Hamilton's &s;i&s;ter, the &s;heriff's lady, to know if they had any letters for Bar|geny. I got a letter and &s;et off in the morning twenty miles. I got there at noon.

The gardeners, being at work, and &s;eeing me before I reached the hou&s;e, told me, that an|other po&s;tillion had been hired; Lady Anne not expecting me, as I was a whole month behind my time. I &s;at down on this, and cried my belly-full; for I was afraid to go back to my ma&s;ter. But the head gardener Mr. Macmorlin, took pity on me and de&s;ired me to go with him down to the hou&s;e, and &s;ee what he could do for me. When I went into the &s;ervants hall I &s;aw the boy that was hired to be po&s;tillion, a &s;tout lad about &s;ix|teen years of age, whereas I was a little lad, not much turned of nine. I therefore thought little of my&s;elf, and &s;at down and cried hear|tily. I then &s;ent letters up &s;tairs from Ma|dam Duff; and Ma&s;ter Scot, the valet de chambre, told I was below. The compa|ny, con&s;i&s;ting of Mr. Hamilton, Lady Anne, and Lady Eleanor Wemys, her &s;i&s;ter, Lord Ray, and Mi&s;s Ram&s;ay, &s;ent for me. I went up with my whip, &s;hirt, and handkerchief,
<PB N="37" REF="45">
my all, round my &s;houlders. Mr. Hamil|ton a&s;ked me, why I did not come &s;ooner? I &s;aid nothing, but cried: for I knew in my own mind, that if my ma&s;ter had not flogged me I &s;hould never have come at all. They a&s;ked me, if I &s;hould like to go back to my ma&s;ter? but they perceived tears in my eyes: &s;o I was &s;ent down &s;tairs, and the coachman was &s;ent for.&mdash;John Bell, you enticed this boy from his ma&s;ter, and you have hired an|other. How are you to do in this?&mdash;Sir, he did not come according to his time; and that is not my fault.&mdash;If you can &s;end this coun|try boy home, &s;atisfy his father, and I will pay you: for he knows nothing about being a po&s;tillion; and as for the other he knows nothing but riding po&s;tillion&mdash;So go down and &s;ettle it among your&s;elves. Among&s;t the &s;ervants there was a divi|&s;ion: for me, Mr. Macgla&s;han the butler, Alexander Campbell, Lady Anne's footman, who afterwards kept the great Inn at Perth,
<PB N="38" REF="46">
and Mr. Macmorlin, the head gardener; all the re&s;t, being low-country people, were again&s;t me; but all the ladies were for me. The other lad, therefore, was &s;ent away. He &s;wore revenge again&s;t me whenever he &s;hould meet me. Lady Anne now &s;et the hou&s;e-keeper to make &s;hirts and &s;tocks for me; and I had new liveries, boots, and &s;hoes. In the cour&s;e of that &s;ummer and harve&s;t the Bargeny family vi&s;ited a great deal; &s;o I came into a plea&s;ant life. Though I remained longer at begging than my &s;i&s;ter or brother, I met the greate&s;t plea&s;ure at la&s;t. Bargeny is &s;ituated in a fine valley, about twelve miles long, and three broad, with a river running through the middle, called the Water of Girvan, which, on each &s;ide, receives brooks from the hills, which are well covered with woods and parks.&mdash;Sir John Whiteford's hou&s;e is the fir&s;t; then the &s;eat of Bar&s;kimming; next Sir Adam Fer|gu&s;on's of Kilkerran; Colonel Kennedy's at

Drumbart; Mr. Kennedy's of Dolwherren; Mr. Macheath of Brun&s;ton; next Bargeny; Sir John Cathcart at Killochan; on one &s;ide Boyd of Pinkills, and, on the other &s;ide of the river, Boyd of Tarchrig; and at the bot|tom of the river, the town of Girven, which belongs to Bargeny. Near this, by the &s;ea-&s;ide, is the &s;eat of Mr. Crawford of Ardmillan; and ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to this valley, twenty-four miles in the &s;ea, a very high hill, called Ail&s;a; which contains Solon Gee&s;e, and many other birds. It belongs to the Earl of Ca&s;&s;illis. My ma&s;ter had a large e&s;tate of twenty thou&s;and acres of ground. He loved to encourage all trades. He had &s;alt pans by the &s;ea &s;ide, and &s;everal coal pits. He had &s;hepherds in the mountains; thirty milch cows; eight young fellows for gardeners: he had al&s;o goats and a&s;&s;es, for milk and whey in the &s;ea&s;on. Mr. Macmor|lin, as already ob&s;erved, was head gardener; Mr. Craig over the farmers; Mr. Maccrinel over the parks and cattle; Mr. Macconnel over the
<PB N="40" REF="48">
hedgers and ditchers; Mr. Heaton over all the &s;alt pans; and Mr. Whorter over all the milch cows; Mr. David&s;on over the car|penters and coopers; and Mr. Macmichin head &s;mith. He &s;oon rai&s;ed his e&s;tate from four thou&s;and to &s;ix thou&s;and pounds a-year, by renewing the old lea&s;es, be&s;ides his own fortune before he came to the e&s;tate of Bargeny, and his lady's. The family have eight upper or lady-maids, four cham|ber-maids, two laundry-maids, two dairy-maids, a plain-worker, a fir&s;t and &s;econd man-cook, a kitchen-maid, a butler, two footmen, a coachman, with po&s;tillions and helpers.&mdash;Lady Polly and Lady Nelly Wemys were often there: they had each of them five hundred pounds per year, and each a maid and footman. The olde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, Lady Betty, was married to Sir James Stuart, who joined Prince Charles in 1745, in com|pany with his wife's brother, Lord Elcho; &s;o that the attendance on Mr. Hamilton,

&s;ome mornings, of his farmers and head men, was like a little levee.</P>
<P>After the new coach was come, that &s;ummer and harve&s;t we rode over all the we&s;t of Scotland. One fine day as the fa|mily was going from the Earl of Ca&s;&s;illis's to Ayr, and Lady Anne was looking out of the coach to &s;ee the country, my po&s;til|lion-hor&s;e &s;tumbled, and I fell over his head. Lady Anne &s;creamed, and fainted away. The coachman &s;topt the &s;ix hor&s;es before the wheels touched me; and, as God would have it, the hor&s;es &s;tepped carefully over me, &s;o that I was not much hurt. I was now obliged to take to my old way of having a &s;trap round my wai&s;t, and fixed to the crupper of the &s;addle.&mdash;Another day, as we were going through an avenue down to the Earl of Dumfries's, at Lochnores, my Laird, who happened to be looking out of the window, &s;aid to

Lady Dumfries, I &s;ee the coach and hor&s;es, with the coachman and two footmen riding after, but I can &s;ee no po&s;tillion. I was very &s;mall and wore a dark brown jacket, as my &s;carlet jacket was not come from Edin|burgh.</P>
<P>When the family returned to Bargeny, I had a great de&s;ire to learn to read, and the &s;ervants gave me a le&s;&s;on when time per|mitted. Wherever I went, I always took the &s;pelling-book with me. I thought that if once I could read the bible, I &s;hould not go to hell. In the winter the whole family went to live in Ayr, where almo&s;t all the families came from their country|hou&s;es to &s;pend the winter in routs and a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>Next year the Bargeny family made a tour of all the ea&s;t part of Scotland. We &s;et off from Bargeny in the month of
<PB N="43" REF="53">
May for Edinburgh. I called to &s;ee my old ma&s;ter. Mr. Gibbs, in place of be|ing angry, was glad to &s;ee me dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;carlet jacket, trimmed with &s;ilver; and as I had about a guinea, I treated my old friends the coachmen and po&s;tillions. I &s;aw my &s;i&s;ter and my young brother. My brother Daniel was on the point of bind|ing him&s;elf to a plai&s;terer and &s;tucco|worker, at Haddington, for &s;even years. We vi&s;ited about the Lothians a great while. At la&s;t we went to the Earl of Murray's. The Counte&s;s of Murray was a relation of Lady Anne's. The &s;ervants were telling in the hall, that Lady Murray had a boy of my name at nur&s;e, that had been run down &s;ome years ago by the hor&s;es in the Canongate. I made an&s;wer, that he was my brother, and that I had been at the nur&s;e's to &s;ee him. I al&s;o took oc|ca&s;ion to mention my &s;i&s;ter, and all that had happened to our family. This account went
<PB N="44" REF="54">
into the parlour, and I was &s;ent for by La|dy Murray, who a&s;ked me, if I knew Alex|ander Macdonald? I an&s;wered I did, and that he was my brother. It was now whi&s;|pered about what my father was; and from that time I was more in favour than before; for Lady Anne's brother, Lord Elcho, and her &s;i&s;ter's hu&s;band, Sir James Stuart, had borne arms on the &s;ide of Prince Charles; and the Earl of Murray's name was Stuart. We vi&s;ited, in the three Lothians, and Fife|&s;hire, the Earl of Murray; the Earl of Bal|carris, my ma&s;ter's brother-in-law; the Earl of Wemys, my lady's father; at the Earl of Had|dington's; Lord Col&s;ton's; Hamilton's of Puncaitland; Sir Hugh Dalrymple's, my ma&s;|ter's brother; Mr. Charteris, my lady's &s;e|cond brother, who changed his name for an e&s;tate of twenty thou&s;and per year, the rich|e&s;t commoner in Scotland. The e&s;tate came by his mother the Counte&s;s of Wemys, being the only daughter of the infamous Charteris.
<PB N="45" REF="55">
The third &s;on of the Earl of Wemys had his father's e&s;tate, becau&s;e the elde&s;t &s;on, Lord Elcho, forfeited his right thereto. From Ea&s;t Lothian we &s;et off for Dunce Wells in the &s;hire of Berwick, a place of great re&s;ort for nobility in tho&s;e years, &s;ituated in as fine a country as any in Great Britain. In the morning the company went to the Wells in their coaches, came home to breakfa&s;t, before dinner went an airing, and at night to ball. Another thing contributed to render Dunce Wells very agreeable and plea&s;ant. The noblemen and gentlemen that have e&s;tates by the Tweed &s;ide, in the &s;ummer and harve&s;t give what they call a kettle of fi&s;h. The entertainment is conducted in the following manner. They all have marqu&eacute;es for the pur|po&s;e, which they pitch near the banks of the river. Orders are given for a large dinner, and plenty of wine and punch. The fi&s;her|men take the &s;almons out of the water, and that moment cut them in peices, throw them
<PB N="46" REF="56">
into boiling water, and, when done, &s;erve them up on table. This treat is called a krab of fi&s;h. There is always mu&s;ic to play after dinner. Some of the company walk along the banks of the Tweed; others play at cards; and the younger part of the gentlemen and ladies dance country-dances on the gra&s;s. They conclude with tea and &s;yllabubs; and then go home. It is the cu&s;|tom for &s;trangers too to give entertainments of this kind, as well as gentlemen who re&s;ide in the neighbourhood. There are often fifty or &s;ixty in company be&s;ides &s;ervants.</P>
<P>We went for one week to Leith Races, and returned to the Wells, and remained till October. We went a &s;hort time to Bargeny, and to Edinburgh all the winter.</P>
<P>About this time Lady Anne's two &s;i&s;ters were married; Lady Nelly married Colonel Dalrymple; Lady Polly a French nobleman.

In the &s;pring of the year the family went from Edinburgh home. Lady Anne at this time had for companions Mi&s;s Duff, Mr. Ha|milton's neice, afterwards Counte&s;s of Dum|fries; Sir John Cathcart's daughter, Mi&s;s Cathcart; Mi&s;s Ram&s;ay from Ayr; and Mi&s;s Crawford of Ardmillan. All the&s;e young la|dies, with the Mi&s;s Kennedys of Drumburle, came and accompanied Lady Anne in their turns, and went out with her in the coach till they married off by degrees.</P>
<P>When Mr. Hamilton and Lady Anne were informed that I was de&s;irous to learn to read, they put me to &s;chool, as there was not much to do, only when the coach and &s;ix was wanted, or when any of tho&s;e young ladies went home, or a vi&s;iting; for then I was always &s;ent with them, with two little ponies, becau&s;e I was light. In the cour&s;e of time, I got reading, writing, and arith|metic: but the coachman became jealous,
<PB N="48" REF="58">
and gave me a flogging; for when he was out with the coach and four hor&s;es, he thought I did not give all the vails I got, when I gave gentlemen their hor&s;es. The helper, being a labourer, and not in livery, was not allowed to lead a hor&s;e out. The coach-man flogged me &s;ometimes till the blood came out of my legs. At &s;uch times I went crying to Mr. Hamilton. Then the coachman was called, to know what his flogging was for. He told Mr. Hamilton, that I neglected to clean the &s;table, or har|ne&s;s, or coach, or chariot. I had taken to keep foxes, hares, ravens, otters, magpyes, and the eagle, &amp;c. &amp;c. He &s;aid I mind|ed the&s;e things more than my bu&s;ine&s;s. This pa&s;&s;ed on for a great while, for Mr. Hamilton did not know the right. As the cooks gave me raw meat for my birds and bea&s;ts, I a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in the kit|chen, particularly in the evening, when I had nothing to do in the &s;tables. By this
<PB N="49" REF="59">
I learned a little of the art of cookery.</P>
<P>As my troubles drove me to be religious, and to read the Bible, the coachman damned me, and &s;aid, I di&s;turbed the hor&s;es by praying. I never went to a fair, harve&s;t, or any merry-making. If any per&s;on died within a mile or two, I went and &s;at up with the dead; and there we all told &s;tories and talked on religious matters. I was al|ways to be found at tho&s;e wakes.</P>
<P>If the fir&s;t and &s;econd cook went out to dancing, or any merry-making, they always pitched upon me to &s;tay in the kitchen with the maid and dre&s;s &s;upper. Then I made pancakes for my&s;elf, as many as I plea&s;ed. If any other per&s;on wanted to go out they a&s;ked me to do for them, and I did.</P>
<P>The people in the we&s;t of Scotland are very religious; and I, hearing of &s;o many
<PB N="50" REF="60">
good people that had died, and knew before|hand the exact time of their death, had the vanity to think, that I &s;hould make my peace with God, and know when I &s;hould die. I have prayed a hundred times that I might die, having heard &s;o much about heaven. I commonly, when &s;upper was carried up into the dining room, went by my&s;elf into a private part of the garden and kneeled down to pray to God. I had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee the Devil; and often looked behind me to &s;ee if I could &s;ee him, that I might rebuke him: for I was confident he could not hurt me.</P>
<P>I had nothing to do in the evening, but be in the kitchen, or &s;ee the &s;ervants at diver|&s;ion in the hall. I often went out with the two grey-hounds and brought in a hare. That &s;port I much delighted in; as al&s;o in go|ing out with the tame otter to catch fi&s;h. As for my fox, when he could break his chain
<PB N="51" REF="61">
he would go out four or five miles in the night, kill the fowls in the gentlemen's hen|hou&s;es, and come home in the morning: But before he was three years old he was killed by &s;ome of the gentlemen's &s;ervants.</P>
<P>The coachman &s;till continued his &s;everity to me; often flogging me unmercifully, and turning me out of the &s;tables. The &s;ervants de&s;ired me to &s;peak to Mr. Hamilton in the garden in the morning. Mr. Hamilton could not tell Lady Anne; for &s;he gave me &s;hirts, &s;tockings, and neck-cloths; and or|dered the hou&s;e-keeper to take care of me. My ma&s;ter did not know what to do. He did not like to turn Bell away: for his family was there. When Mr. Hamilton got a &s;er|vant that an&s;wered his purpo&s;e, he de&s;ired him to bring his family; and he gave them hou&s;es: &s;o that on each &s;ide of the road, a quarter of a mile from Bargeny, there was a little village, with gardens behind the
<PB N="52" REF="62">
hou&s;es, enclo&s;ed with a ditch, and two rows of hedges; for which hou&s;es he made them pay a &s;mall rent yearly.</P>
<P>The coachman took another method to get the money from me: but I mu&s;t fir&s;t tell how I got it my&s;elf. We had two little ponies, that &s;eldom went out, but when I went with them. I went twice a week for the letters to Maybole, the po&s;t town; and I was often &s;ent on a Me&s;&s;age to Ayr to Mr. Duff's. And I was often going out with the young ladies, taking them home, or going for them, or, at the holiday times, for Mr. Duff's &s;ons to &s;tay a few weeks, when I u&s;ed to ride out with them. By all this I got money: for in tho&s;e days there was money in plenty, as trade flouri&s;hed, and there were not many taxes. When I came home, John Bell would a&s;k me what I had got. I com|monly denied that I had got any thing: but he &s;earched my pocket and told me he would
<PB N="53" REF="63">
take care of it; and that he would give me his daughter when we grew up, &s;o that it would be all the &s;ame to me when I had her for a wife: and he de&s;ired me to mark it all down. After this, when I came home, I hid my money in holes; and &s;ome of it is there to this day; for it &s;lipped down, &s;o that I could not get it out again.</P>
<P>In 1754 our family made a tour of the We&s;t Highlands. We &s;et off in the begin|ning of May by Ayr, Gla&s;gow, and Dum|barton. We next went to Lu&s;s, where my ma&s;ter &s;tayed three weeks at Mr. Leach's Inns and drank goats whey. Lu&s;s is a vil|lage clo&s;e by the &s;ide of Lochlomond. This lake is fre&s;h water, twenty-four miles long; and acro&s;s between Lu&s;s and the Duke of Montro&s;e's hou&s;e eight miles. In other parts the lake is not &s;o broad. Sir James Colqu|houn's hou&s;e is at the bottom of the lake. There are twenty-four i&s;lands in it that be|long
<PB N="54" REF="64">
to the Duke and Sir James. Some of the&s;e are covered with fir, with birds, and with deer. My ma&s;ter and lady went in a boat at different times to &s;ee them all, and an airing by the &s;ide of the lake, every day. On each &s;ide of the lake are high mountains. We left Lu&s;s, and went to the Tarbet, ten miles further, on the &s;ide of the lake. There we &s;tayed all night, right over again&s;t the great mountain of Benlomond, where the &s;now lay on the north &s;ide almo&s;t the whole year; and in the fine&s;t day in &s;ummer a cloud covers it like an umbrella; and by the &s;hape of the cloud they can tell what weather it is to be. Next day we &s;et out for Inverary, where the Duke of Argyle's hou&s;e &s;tands. On the road to this place we pa&s;&s;ed gentle|men's &s;eats, went over mountains, round great lakes, and through glens. Inverary is a neat little town on the &s;ide of Lochfine; and the dukes palace is at the end of the town, one of the fine&s;t &s;ights in Great Britain. The
<PB N="55" REF="65">
hou&s;e, gardens, woods, hills, and ca&s;cades, would be a fine treat for a Londoner. From this we went to the races at Leith, and returned to Bargeny in harve&s;t, and &s;taid there the winter following. In the year 1755 the fa|mily received company at home. Then we went to balls in Ayr, and a vi&s;iting round the country.</P>
<P>In that year a report was &s;pread of me concerning one of the fair &s;ex. A pretty fair-haired girl of our pari&s;h was put ap|prentice to a mantua-maker in the po&s;t|town, Maybole, fourteen years old, about my own age. She came home on Saturday af|ternoon, and &s;tayed with her mother, a widow, that kept a farm. She had to walk about five miles. The third Saturday after I &s;aw her I &s;poke to her, and a&s;ked if &s;he would ride. She agreed; and ever after, when I came for the letters &s;he rode behind me. Even the two ponies knew her when they &s;aw her; and drew near the bank for her to mount.
<PB N="56" REF="66">
Sometimes &s;he came at night to meet me; and then I walked near home with her. So, in time, the people began to &s;peak of us at Bargeny and made me much a&s;hamed. One day Mr. Scott the clerk of the pari&s;h came about bu&s;ine&s;s to my ma&s;ter: for Mr. Ha|milton was ruling elder of the pari&s;h, and this Mr. Scott was &s;chool-ma&s;ter where I went to learn. He had all the children in the pa|ri&s;h both high and low. He taught Engli&s;h, Latin, and Greek. He kept an u&s;her; and a woman for the girls. His income was greater than the par&s;on's of the pari&s;h. He had a boy to teach tho&s;e that were in the &s;pelling|book. He taught his fir&s;t &s;cholars the &s;hort|hand writing. He wrote the &s;ermon every Sunday in church, and taught the gentlemen's &s;ons to do the &s;ame. When Mr. Scott was not well on Sundays, the grave-digger gave out the p&s;alms, and wrote the &s;ermon as well as Mr. Scott. Well, after dinner, in the &s;econd ta|ble room, where Mr. Scott dined, the upper &s;ervants told him of me and the girl: and, for
<PB N="57" REF="67">
their own diver&s;ion, called me in. Jack, &s;aid Mr. Scott, I have been with Mr. Hamilton about you. I hear &s;trange accounts of you; about decoying away Sally Macrath. The church mu&s;t be &s;atisfied. I mu&s;t have you before the mini&s;ter, and all the elders. So they roa&s;ted me in this manner; and all the other &s;ervants were laughing one to another. It afforded them fine &s;port.</P>
<P>I have nothing to mention till our journey to Edinburgh. Mr. Hamilton and Lady Anne made an appointment with their friends to &s;pend the winter in that city, and to be there before Chri&s;tmas. A hou&s;e was taken; but, in the beginning of December, a great &s;now fell, which in hollow places filled up the roads. Mr. Hamilton told my Lady that &s;he could not go before the &s;now was melt|ed, but &s;he would not be di&s;appointed; for &s;he was very proud, and valued her&s;elf much on account of the great family &s;he &s;prung
<PB N="58" REF="68">
from, Macduff that killed Macbeth, king of Scotland. She wrote a letter to Mr. Mac|gla&s;han, chairman, to &s;end out her chair, with &s;ix of his men, to carry her through the &s;now. As Mr. Macgla&s;han, butler, and his wife, the hou&s;e-keeper at Bargeny, were uncle and aunt to the chairman, he came to &s;ee them, and brought five of his chairmen, for he car|ried as one him&s;elf. After the men had re&s;t|ed two days, we &s;et out for Edinburgh before Chri&s;tmas, with the coach and &s;ix, the but|ler, fir&s;t cook, and two footmen on hor&s;e|back, and a hor&s;e in hand for my ma&s;ter; &s;o when the roads were bad, and deep with &s;now, Lady Anne took to her chair, Mr. Hamilton rode along &s;ide of it, and the two ladies and lady's maid got up behind the &s;er|vants. In this manner we travelled, and ar|rived in five days all well, in Edinburgh, where we continued till the month of April, 1756.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="69">
We &s;tood at Boyd's livery-&s;tables, at the head of the Cannongate, &s;ix hor&s;es and two &s;addle hor&s;es. The coachman had board wa|ges; Mr. Boyd charged five &s;hillings per week for me; but, on account of the eight hor&s;es at livery, Mr. Bell being &s;o called, as he was a &s;ix-hor&s;e coachman, had his victu|als for nothing all the winter. We both &s;lept at Boyd's Inn, as well as boarded. Mrs. Boyd had a brother's daughter that lived with her, and acted as bar-maid, a beautiful girl of fif|teen; &s;he took a liking to me and I to her. I made her and the Engli&s;h cook-maid pre|&s;ents of ribbands, &s;ilk handkerchiefs, and &s;ilver &s;leeve-buttons, and Mi&s;s Cochran called me her &s;weet-heart. The cook-maid made me often ki&s;s her, and &s;he liked me much. When John Bell &s;aw how &s;he liked me, he &s;aid, Jack you are a damned fool if you don't marry Kitty Cochran, for &s;he will be a for|tune for you, as &s;he is heire&s;s to Mr. Boyd, who is rich, and has no children. He &s;aid,
<PB N="60" REF="70">
Mi&s;s Cochran will you marry John Macdo|nald? &s;he an&s;wered, I will. John Bell &s;aw what would have been good; but I had not the &s;en&s;e to &s;ee it my&s;elf. If I had &s;een it, I might have had her; for the Par&s;on that mar|ried tho&s;e that came from England every week, lived within forty yards, and would have married us for half a crown; but, if you will not when you may, when you will you &s;hall have nay.</P>
<P>We had a very agreeable winter, and, as God would have it, I had the be&s;t part of it. We never went out with Lady Anne, even an airing, with le&s;s than &s;ix hor&s;es, with the two footmen on hor&s;e-back, with pi&s;tols and furniture compleat. When any one of the young ladies went on hor&s;e-back, I went with her. When Mr. Hamilton rode an airing, I went with him al&s;o: the coachman was too heavy, and the footman had enough to do at home. The young gentlemen envied my
<PB N="61" REF="71">
life, and often &s;aid, I wi&s;h I had as plea&s;ant a life as you. If my ma&s;ter wanted to dine at a gentleman's hou&s;e, he would &s;ay, Jack, go to the inn with the hor&s;es, and there is half a crown to pay for the hor&s;es and you. Sometimes the &s;ervants a&s;ked me to dine where my ma&s;ter dined, and by that means I had it in my power to &s;ave a &s;hilling or two; and now and then Mr. Hamilton would give me half a crown, which &s;erved me for pocket money to &s;pend in the evening at Boyd's. When there was company the coachman and I waited at dinner, and I went to the hou&s;e every morning for orders.&mdash;When I heard that they were &s;peaking of going to Bargeny, one day as I was riding out with my ma&s;ter, I gave him warning. He a&s;ked me for what I wanted to go? I &s;aid I was too big to ride po&s;tillion, and that I wanted to get a coachman's place. He told me, if I would &s;top, he would give me the &s;addle hor&s;es and a &s;table for my&s;elf, and that
<PB N="62" REF="72">
I &s;hould be groom. I told him, that would make John Bell wor&s;e again&s;t me than ever: I hoped his honour would let me go. Well, &s;aid he, &s;ee if you can get a place before I go out of town. Yes, Sir, I &s;aid. I am &s;ure he had a great regard for me. God ble&s;s him to all eternity. Next day he told John Bell, when he came to the &s;table, that he mu&s;t hire a po&s;tillion if Jack &s;hould get a place, for he would not have a country boy that did not know how to ride. I would have taken the groom's place; it was as good as a guinea a week, but I did not like to be in oppo&s;ition to the coachman, for I looked upon him as my benefactor, next to Mr. Hamilton. He and Lady Anne were the means of my having education, and being put in a way to get my bread. Next morning, when John Bell and I were in Mr. Hume's yard, the coachmaker, where our coach &s;tood, as we were cleaning the coach, Mr. Hume came along. John Bell a&s;ked him if he knew of any place; for John
<PB N="63" REF="73">
Macdonald was about to leave Bargeny's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Mr. Bell, how long has he lived with you? He has been po&s;tillion with us &s;ix years, &s;ince we hired him from your neighbour, Mr. Gibbs. Good God, &s;aid he, how old are you Jack? Sir, &s;aid I, I have entered into &s;ix|teen. Well, &s;aid Mr. Hume, that is a great character indeed, to live &s;ix years out of fif|teen in the world, in one place. I have re|ceived two letters for po&s;tillions, one from the Earl of Glencairn, for a &s;et of hor&s;e po&s;til|lions, the other from the Earl of Crauford, for one to drive the po&s;t-chai&s;es and four hor&s;es, to have the charge of the &s;addle hor&s;es, and to have a boy to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and ride po&s;tillion.</P>
<P>I liked this place, as I was to have no &s;er|vant over me; and told Mr. Hume, that I had known Lady Crauford for years, when I was
<PB N="64" REF="74">
out with the ladies, as before-mentioned.&mdash;She was often in their company, for her fa|ther had a hou&s;e in the town of Ayr, where my ma&s;ter had one. She had been married to the Earl of Crauford at Chri&s;tmas. Mr. Hume hired me for five pounds a year to the Earl of Crauford, the fir&s;t Earl in Scotland, the chief of the Craufords and Lind&s;ays. He wrote to Lord Crauford, that he had hired a &s;ervant for his purpo&s;e, from his neighbour Mr. Hamilton of Bargeny, and that he would enter into his &s;ervice on the fifteenth of May. Mr. Hume let us &s;ee the po&s;t-chai&s;e that was fini&s;hing for Lord Crauford, one of the fir&s;t that ever went out of the yard. I gave the man half a crown to drink, and was very well plea&s;ed with my engagement. John Bell hired a po&s;tillion from Boyd's livery-&s;tables, from among&s;t the po&s;t-chai&s;e boys. Near the end of April we left Edinburgh for Bar|geny, and I took leave of Mi&s;s Cochran. I wrote her a letter, and &s;he an&s;wered it: but
<PB N="65" REF="75">
ab&s;ence is a great enemy to love; Ro&s;s the waiter got her with child and married her; &s;o I lo&s;t her, and &s;he lo&s;t her&s;elf. Ro&s;s was a good waiter, but otherwi&s;e a bad charac|ter. When Mr. and Mrs. Boyd found they were married, they were both turned away. She bore a boy that was blind, and &s;he her&s;elf broke her heart and died; &s;o there was an end of one of the fine&s;t girls in Edinburgh.</P>
<P>Lady Anne never &s;aw the po&s;tillion till the morning after we left Edinburgh, on our way to Bargeny, at Hamilton, when he was get|ting on behind the coach. As we were going away on the journey, Lady Anne a&s;ked, what boy was behind the coach? Mr. Hamil|ton told her it was the new po&s;tillion. Is Jack going away then? Yes, Lady Anne, he is hired to the Earl of Crauford: he told me he wanted to go, as John Bell and he could not agree.&mdash;It is very odd, after rearing him &s;ix years, and giving him education, to let
<PB N="66" REF="76">
him go, and hire one in his place, and me ne|ver to hear any thing of it. At night, when Lady Anne was going to bed, &s;he &s;aid to her maid, If I had known, I would have brought John Macdonald up to be my footman, and not to be u&s;ed as he has been by John Bell.</P>
<P>We arrived at Bargeny, and, on the 13th of May, Mr. Hamilton called me into his &s;tudy to pay me off. He a&s;ked me what mo|ney I had. I told him twenty &s;hillings.&mdash;Have you ever received any wages from me? I &s;aid, No, &s;ir. My ma&s;ter &s;aid, Jack, if I give you two pounds that will be enough for your pocket. Lord Crauford will give you money when you want; and I will give you a note of hand for your ten pounds, and five per cent. for it; and when you &s;ee me in Ayr, call for me when the intere&s;t is due, and I will pay you. I told him I was very much obliged to his honour, and &s;aid, God Al|mighty ble&s;s you; and thank you for your
<PB N="67" REF="77">
goodne&s;s. I got the note of hand, and &s;et out next morning on one of my ma&s;ter's hor|&s;es for Ayr, where I &s;taid all night; and next day I hired a hor&s;e, and went eighteen miles to Kilburnie, the &s;eat of the Earl of Crau|ford.</P>
<P>When I arrived I &s;ent the letter up, from Mr. Hume, and I my&s;elf being in livery, the &s;ervants did not know who I was, till I was called up &s;tairs, and told them that Mr. Hamil|ton and Lady Anne de&s;ired their compliments Lord and Lady Crauford. When I came down to the hall, the &s;ervants knew who I was, and came to look at me again, and &s;aid Pray &s;ir, is your name John Macdonald? I &s;aid Yes. They &s;aid, it is very odd, as my Lord has this day di&s;charged his gardener, who lived here three years: he is gone to Edinburgh, and his name was John Macdo|nald, are you his &s;on? I &s;aid, I never heard of him before; but the farmers called me his
<PB N="68" REF="78">
&s;on. Now Lady Crauford, till la&s;t Chri&s;tmas, was Mi&s;s Hamilton of Bourtreehill, one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed young ladies in Scotland, for appearance, virtue, and a fortune. Mr. Hamillon of Bourtreehill had four daughters; Lady Crauford was the elde&s;t; each of them had ten thou&s;and pounds, but a fine e&s;tate, at Mr. Hamilton's death, was to come to Lady Crauford's children; and what money he had was to be divided among&s;t his daughters.&mdash;Many gentlemen of fortune in the &s;hire of Ayr paid their addre&s;&s;es to them, and among&s;t them, Colonel Montgomery, brother to Lord Eglington, who wanted to have been mar|ried to the elde&s;t. Mr. Hamilton offered him ten thou&s;and pounds;&mdash;but Colonel Montgomery wanted fifteen thou&s;and pounds down.</P>
<P>By this di&s;agreement the match was broke off; &s;o after this, the Earl of Crauford paid his addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s Hamilton, and &s;he left
<PB N="69" REF="79">
her father's lodgings in Edinburgh, with|out leave or ceremony, and was married to the Earl, by whom &s;he had three &s;ons and two daughters. Next year Colonel Montgomery rai&s;ed a regiment of Highland|ers on the e&s;tate of Sir James Macdonald, his nephew, who was then at &s;chool in Eng|land. The Colonel went to America with his regiment for &s;everal years. At the death of his brother, the Earl, who was &s;hot by Mungo Campbell, the exci&s;eman, he got the e&s;tate and title, and afterwards married Lady Jane Lind&s;ay, Lady Crauford's elde&s;t daughter. If he lo&s;t the mother, he gained the daughter. I began the fir&s;t night of my &s;ervice with dancing. There were two fid|lers at Kilburnie for a week. I went beg|ging to Mr. Gibbs, crying to Bargeny, and dancing to Lord Crauford's. In a week our chai&s;e was &s;ent from Edinburgh, with the harne&s;s. We had four fine long tailed greys, with good &s;addle hor&s;es; our li|veries
<PB N="70" REF="80">
were blue and &s;carlet, trimmed with gold lace. We had a plea&s;ant &s;ummer and harve&s;t for vi&s;iting and &s;eeing company.&mdash;My Lady's &s;i&s;ters were commonly with her, or with their father at Bourtreehill. In a week after I came to Kilburnie, the groom's daughter, Amelia Burn, came to be cham|bermaid to Lady Crauford, under the lady's|maid; &s;he was the hand&s;ome&s;t girl in the pa|ri&s;h, or in the &s;hire; her father, James Burn, lived twenty-eight years in the family; her mother had a hou&s;e to live in, and &s;o much a year, and took care of a natural &s;on of my Lord's. James Burn died about two months before I came home, &s;o I took his place and my own. From the fir&s;t day, Amelia took a liking to me, and I to her. Lady Crau|ford and the young ladies told her the impru|dence of being &s;o fond of Jack Macdonald, but all to no purpo&s;e. One day, as I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">s toy|ing with the plain worker, Amelia drove her away and &s;truck me. I went into the &s;table,
<PB N="71" REF="81">
and &s;aid to my&s;elf, if I toy with any other girl it is all fooli&s;hne&s;s, for none is &s;o beau|tiful as her&s;elf; and I mu&s;t re&s;pect James Burn's daughter: &s;o I never put hands, while I &s;taid at Kilburnie, onany girl after. I called to &s;ee her mother every day. I commonly carried a pudding or &s;ome tarts for my Lord's &s;on, &s;o that it became a bye-word among the &s;ervants, that the chambermaid and the old wheels became Jack Macdonald's perqui&s;ites. She made me &s;hirts at her lei&s;ure hours, and I was as happy as a prince.</P>
<P>One day, as we were going to Mr. Mac|dougal's of Ca&s;tle Semple, as I was walking the carriage and four fine hor&s;es round the green, the two &s;addle hor&s;es for the footmen, and the &s;ide-&s;addle hor&s;e for my Lady's &s;i&s;|ter, following after the carriage, the young ladies remarked, that they never &s;aw any equi|page turn out &s;o clean as Jack Macdonald's did. Lady Crauford made an&s;wer, I don't
<PB N="72" REF="82">
wonder that it is reported, Jack Macdo|nald's father was a captain in the Prince's army, for he certainly is &s;ome gentleman's &s;on, or &s;ome nobleman or gentleman's ba&s;|tard. I might mention twenty things of this kind, but it would be the &s;ame thing over again.</P>
<P>In the harve&s;t my Lady was brought to bed of her fir&s;t child, afterwards Counte&s;s of Eglington. After &s;he recovered, my Lord and Mr. Hamilton, his father-in-law, went to &s;ee the Duke of Argyle, at Inverary in Argyle&s;hire. As I had been there before with Mr. Hamilton of Bargeny, I could the better de&s;cribe the places to my Lord. When he &s;aw the mountains, lakes, rivers, and val|lies, near Inverary, he &s;aid there was not &s;uch a plea&s;ant place in all Europe; and he recom|mended it as &s;uch to my Lady, and told her, that Archibald, Duke of Argyle, had invited her to Inverary in the &s;ummer, when he &s;hould
<PB N="73" REF="83">
come down from London: &s;o accordingly they went.</P>
<P>The family of Crauford kept their Chri&s;t|mas with their friends, and lived at Kil|burnie all the winter, for the la&s;t time.&mdash;In the month of April, 1757, as I was go|ing to the &s;table to my hor&s;es, about five in the morning, on a Sunday, as I looked back to the hou&s;e, I &s;aw the &s;moke coming through the roof very fa&s;t. I returned and alarmed the family. When I went into the hou&s;e, Amelia Burn was ju&s;t come down; except her the whole family was in bed. None of the men &s;ervants &s;lept in the hou&s;e: we all &s;lept in an office adjoining. I told her to let my Lord know there was a fire in the hou&s;e. She went up and gave the alarm; my Lord came down ha&s;tily to me. I told him the upper part of the hou&s;e was on fire. My Lord and I got the key of the fir&s;t garret, which was a place for all the lumber. We &s;aw the fire was
<PB N="74" REF="84">
in the barrack room, where there were four beds for &s;trange &s;ervants; and when there were no &s;trangers, the place was &s;hut up.&mdash;When we came to the door, the room was like an oven. I opened the door, and the flames bur&s;t out again&s;t me with &s;uch force, that in two minutes it &s;pread through all the other rooms. My Lord called Lady Crau|ford and her &s;i&s;ters, and took the young lady, her daughter, out of bed; and in twelve mi|nutes the room where the child, the nur&s;e, and the hou&s;e-keeper lay, was in flames.&mdash;They lay in a room in the three pair of &s;tairs, at the further end of a long pa&s;&s;age, which was &s;oon &s;topt by the progre&s;s of the flames. My Lady's &s;i&s;ters and all the maid &s;ervants lay on the &s;ame floor; and as there was no en|gine, nor water, the noble hou&s;e of Kilburnie, the ancient &s;eat of the Vi&s;counts of Gar|nock was burnt down to the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="85">
A me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to Mr. Hamilton, at Bourtreehill; and the family went to the Rev. Malcolm Brown's hou&s;e, the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h. Mr. Hamilton came, and made my Lord an offer of Bourtreehill to live in, tell|ing him, that he him&s;elf would live at his hou&s;e in Ayr. My Lord accepted the offer, and went to Bourtreehill, and remained there. The &s;ervants' apartments at Kilburnie were altered for my Lord to live in when he came a &s;hooting, or to do bu&s;ine&s;s with his factor. Mrs. Burn lived in the hou&s;e with my Lord's &s;on, and dre&s;&s;ed what he wanted when he came. I was re&s;pected after the fire, for being the means, under God, of pre&s;erving three families.</P>
<P>In the month of May the family &s;et out for Inverary, by Gla&s;gow and Dumbarton: they &s;topt at Lu&s;s &s;ix weeks, to drink goats whey, and take plea&s;ure on and round Loch|lomond, and then went to the Duke of Ar|gyle's,
<PB N="76" REF="86">
where they remained two days with the Duke, at his palace. We went an air|ing to &s;ee his woods, hills, and ca&s;cades, and a &s;ailing on his &s;alt and fre&s;h water lakes.&mdash;We left Inverary and went to Edinburgh, to be at Leith races. In the harve&s;t we went home to Bourtreehill; and &s;oon after thismy Lady was brought to bed of a &s;on, the Lord Vi&s;count of Garnock. In the winter my Lord went to London; and my Lady fre|quently went out on hor&s;eback; but, when her &s;i&s;ter went with her, &s;he went in the car|riage. She never once went out the whole time I lived there, either on hor&s;e-back or in the carriage, but I was with her. If any per&s;on &s;poke again&s;t me to my Lord or her|&s;elf, &s;he told me who the per&s;on was, becau&s;e I &s;aved her daughter, Lady Jane, from the flames. She delighted in riding out and cour&s;ing a hare with the grey hounds. My Lord began to take a di&s;like to me, for which I was very &s;orry;&mdash;and, my readers, I cannot
<PB N="77" REF="87">
tell you for what. Soon after this, in the harve&s;t of 1759, I gave my Lord warning, and was di&s;charged the fifteenth of Novem|ber, being the Term day, and Amelia came away with child, at the &s;ame time. I went to Kilburnie, and took a room near her mo|ther's, as &s;he had a milch cow, and plenty to give her. I gave her &s;ix guineas, and other things nece&s;&s;ary. I thought to marry her when I got a place. I went to Bargeny to get my ten pounds from Mr. Hamilton.&mdash;When I came to Bargeny, Thomas Hardy, the Engli&s;h coachman, had been drowned two weeks pa&s;t: one dark night coming from a public hou&s;e he fell into a coal-pit. Mr. Hamilton &s;ent for a coachman to Edinburgh, and I drove Lady Anne till he came.</P>
<P>About three weeks after this, when I got my money, I went and &s;taid a week at Kil|burnie. One day I went to the mini&s;ter's hou&s;e, and de&s;ired the favour of him, that
<PB N="78" REF="88">
when Amelia was brought to bed, he would be &s;o good as to chri&s;ten the child: he pro|mi&s;ed he would, and &s;o he did. So one of my fellow &s;ervants and I &s;et off for Edinburgh, and Amelia went a little way with us. He a&s;ked her if &s;he would like to have John Macdonald for a hu&s;band? She an&s;wered, &s;he would wait twenty years, and then beg her bread with me for life.</P>
<P>When we arrived in Edinburgh, I lodged at my &s;i&s;ter's hou&s;e all the winter. She had been married &s;ome years. The young man who accompanied me to Edinburgh got a place, and I put my&s;elf to hair-dre&s;&s;ing.&mdash;When Mr. Hamilton came to Edinburgh, on his way to London, for he was in Parlia|ment, he &s;aw me, and a&s;ked me, if I had got a place. I told him I had put my&s;elf to hair-dre&s;&s;ing.&mdash;Then, Jack, call for me when I return from London. I &s;aid, I would. I &s;tuck clo&s;e to the &s;hop till May. I lo&s;t no
<PB N="79" REF="89">
time. I dre&s;&s;ed the cu&s;tomers at home and abroad. When Mr. Hamilton came from London, I called to &s;ee him. He de&s;ired me to dre&s;s his hair, and I plea&s;ed him very well. He told me that James Scott had ta|ken the Haugh-hill farm, and was to leave him. When he went he married the Lady's maid; &s;o Mr. Hamilton hired me for his own &s;ervant. Mr. Scott lived twelve years in his &s;ervice, and &s;aved &s;ix hundred pounds. Near the end of May, Mr. Hamilton, Lady Anne, and Mi&s;s Duff, &s;et out for Bargeny, with the re&s;t of the family. In the year 1750, I went with my po&s;tillion whip round my &s;houlders; and now, in the year 1760, to the &s;ame hou&s;e, to be Mr. Hamilton's body &s;ervant.</P>
<P>I now &s;et out on life, without conduct, or this world's cunning. I was a greater plague to my ma&s;ter and benefactor than one would think. I did not know the value of good
<PB N="80" REF="90">
luck, nor of money. Coming into two &s;uch plentiful families, I thought the whole world was the garden of Eden. My ma&s;ter knew what was good for me; but I had not the &s;en&s;e to take his advice. Gentlemen know the world better than we. I was put out of my latitude by contrary winds; I mean wo|men. Mr. and Mrs. Scott went to their farm. One Mrs. Mander&s;on took her place. She was not there three months till &s;he was di&s;charged and &s;ent back to Edinburgh; and an elderly woman was &s;ent for to be hou&s;e|keeper.</P>
<P>The chambermaid &s;poke &s;omething about Mrs. Mander&s;on and me; and Lady Anne &s;aid, I would ruin my &s;oul with her. After this, a report was &s;pread about the chamber|maid and me: &s;o the hou&s;ekeeper always locked the rooms, as &s;he thought thereby to keep us from meeting. As the general elec|tion was to come on next April, this harve&s;t
<PB N="81" REF="91">
was &s;pent by Mr. Hamilton, in the &s;hire of Galloway, that he might pay his re&s;pects to the gentlemen. He took me, the po&s;tillion, and po&s;t-chai&s;e, and the helper, to take care of the hor&s;es. We travelled thus through the whole &s;hire, making intere&s;t, giving balls and fea&s;ts to the gentlemen and ladies at Stranraer and Wigton. A plea&s;ant time we had of it. We returned home, and in No|vember went to Edinburgh, where Lady Anne lived all the winter; but my ma&s;ter and I went po&s;t for London. When the par|liament broke up in March, 1761, my ma&s;|ter and his brother, Sir Hugh Dalrymple, returned to &s;ecure their election. When they arrived in Edinburgh, they had a mind to go immediately to the country. But the Duke of Douglas died, which &s;topt them &s;ome time, to get all things ready for the grande&s;t bury|ing that has been in Great Britain for a hundred years pa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="92">
The proce&s;&s;ion took two days in going from Edinburgh to Douglas Ca&s;tle. On this occa&s;ion there was the greate&s;t fea&s;ting and drinking I ever &s;aw. There were about three hundred per&s;ons, in carriages and on hor&s;eback, with all the family honours. All the company returned to Hamilton, and there di&s;per&s;ed. Mr. Hamilton and Sir Hugh re|turned to Edinburgh, and directly &s;et out for Bargeny.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter &s;et off for Galloway with the &s;ame &s;ervants as before. Our place of en|tertainment was at Wigton. The conte&s;t was great between the Earl of Galloway's &s;on, the Hon. Keith Stuart and my ma&s;ter. There was &s;uch riding back and forward, and drinking, for one month, that was enough to kill the devil. The election was gained by my ma&s;ter, who gave a ball to the ladies and gentlemen, and returned to Bargeny in
<PB N="83" REF="93">
triumph. I &s;ent a letter to Amelia Burns and her &s;on, to come to Bargeny. She came and lodged at the public-hou&s;e two weeks. She was much re&s;pected, and the boy much admired. Six weeks after, my ma&s;ter went to Gla&s;gow about bu&s;ine&s;s. Going through Kilburnie pari&s;h, he a&s;ked que&s;tions, and &s;aid, Are the&s;e the walls of Lord Crauford's hou&s;e? Yes, &s;ir. Who perceived it fir&s;t? I did, &s;ir; and alarmed the family, about five in the morning. Have you not a child in this pa|ri&s;h? Yes, &s;ir, in that village before you. Well, you may go and &s;ee him; I &s;hall ride gently on. I went, and &s;aw Amelia and the boy, and, having had &s;omething to drink, went after my ma&s;ter. It was only three miles to Mr. Macdougal's, of Ca&s;tle Semple, where he was to dine, and &s;tay all night.&mdash;When we came there, and my ma&s;ter had his &s;hoes on, and his curls let out, I had a hor&s;e from the groom, and went back to Amelia, and &s;taid three or four hours. My
<PB N="84" REF="94">
ma&s;ter &s;taid next day, and I went back again.</P>
<P>We went next to Gla&s;gow, and then to Edinburgh. Mr. Hamilton returned to Ayr, where Lady Anne met him, and &s;taid three or four days with his &s;i&s;ter, Mrs. Duff.&mdash;When they went home they took Mrs. Innes with them, that had been on a vi&s;it at Mr. Duff's. She was a widow lady, daughter to Sir Andrew Agnew, who&s;e hu&s;band, when alive, was very much in my ma&s;ter's intere&s;t in Stranraer. Mrs. Innes wore a wig; and, for the head-ach, had her head &s;haved three times a week, without the lea&s;t harm or evil thoughts on either &s;ide. But the lady's maid told my Lady, that I went into Mrs. Innes's room, very often before &s;he came to breakfa&s;t.&mdash;One night Lady Anne wrote her a card, and &s;ent it into her bed-room, de&s;iring her to make her&s;elf ready to return to Ayr in the morning, for at Bargeny &s;he &s;hould not &s;leep
<PB N="85" REF="95">
another night. It quite &s;urpri&s;ed Mrs. Innes, and &s;he a&s;ked the chamber-maid, if &s;he knew the rea&s;on of this card being &s;ent to her?&mdash;Madam, I believe &s;he thinks there is &s;ome|thing between Jack Macdonald and you; for Lady Anne turned off the hou&s;e-keeper, chamber-maid, and her own god-daughter, when &s;he thought there was any love be|tween them and Jack. And you know, Ma|dam, the Earl and Counte&s;s of Crauford have been parted almo&s;t a twelvemonth; and I dare &s;ay you have heard for what. Very well, Betty, give my re&s;pects to Lady Anne, and I &s;hould wi&s;h to go off at &s;ix in the morning. The chai&s;e was ready, and &s;he went to Ayr, to Mrs. Duff's, to breakfa&s;t. Mrs. Duff &s;aid, what made you come away before breakfa&s;t, Mrs. Innes? She &s;hewed her Lady Anne's card. There is my warning for having John Macdonald to &s;have my head, the &s;ame as Jack ever does to me, when he comes to Mr. Duff's. Mrs. Duff was extremely unea&s;y,
<PB N="86" REF="96">
and &s;aid, for God's &s;ake don't &s;peak of it to Mr. Duff. This is a fine return to me for Mr. Innes's friend&s;hip to Mr. Hamilton, at his election. My ma&s;ter a&s;ked for Mrs. In|nes at dinner. Lady Anne &s;aid &s;he was gone to Ayr. To Ayr, &s;aid he, without taking leave? It made him a little unea&s;y, for he thought that &s;omething was the matter. Af|ter dinner he a&s;ked Lady Anne's maid if &s;he knew what Mrs. Innes went away for in &s;uch a hurry? She an&s;wered, I don't know, &s;ir. Lady Anne &s;ent her a card, but I did not know the contents. Who carried it to Mrs. Innes? She &s;aid the chamber-maid. Send her to me.&mdash;When &s;he came, he a&s;ked her if &s;he knew for what Mrs. Innes went away?&mdash;Sir, I believe it was becau&s;e John Macdonald went into her chamber to &s;have her head.&mdash;He turned round, and &s;aid nothing; but it turned my ma&s;ter again&s;t me, as I &s;oon di&s;co|vered: for, next day, a number of gentlemen met at Girvan to play at the golf or cricket.
<PB N="87" REF="97">
The gentlemen, after dinner, drank freely, and my ma&s;ter was in liquor. In the even|ing, when we came all home to Bargeny, he a&s;ked me for one of the clubs that was not in the chai&s;e with the re&s;t. I an&s;wered, &s;ir, I &s;uppo&s;e it is left at the inn. With that he took one of the clubs, and broke it in pieces over my back, and &s;aid, You damn'd &s;coun|drel, provide your&s;elf with a place. Sir Wil|liam Maxwell, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Mac|culloch, &s;aw him &s;trike me. Lady Anne, Mrs. Duff, Mi&s;s Duff, two Mi&s;s Kennedys, and Mi&s;s Crauford of Ardmillan, &s;eeing my ma&s;ter a little confu&s;ed, and I not waiting at &s;upper, Lady Anne a&s;ked Mr. Hamilton what was become of John Macdonald? But no an|&s;wer. Sir William &s;aid, I believe, my Lady, he is not come yet from Girvan. After &s;up|per, the ladies having heard what had pa&s;&s;ed, were very &s;orry; but they believed me to be innocent, and &s;o I really was. I was called up next morning to dre&s;s Mr. Hamilton.&mdash;
<PB N="88" REF="98">
Neither he nor I &s;poke a word about what had pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t night; and I directly forgot all evil. We &s;et off for Ea&s;t Lothian, to &s;ee his e&s;tate and his friends. On the journey he hired a &s;ervant of Colonel Dalrymple, a &s;ervant of experience, and Mr. Hamilton made a man of him; for in a few years he put him into one of the fir&s;t inns in Ayr.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter &s;aw that I had no conduct, and did not know the value of a good place.&mdash;When we returned to Bargeny &s;ome time af|ter, there was a race of hor&s;es at Girvan.&mdash;When Mr. Hamilton came to Mr. Stuart's inn, where all the gentlemen went to dine, he &s;aid to me, as I was dre&s;&s;ing his hair, John, I think the be&s;t thing you could do, would be to marry Jane Stuart, for by doing &s;o you would &s;oon make a fortune.&mdash;Sir, I am obliged to you for your advice; but I thought light of it, and thought no more of it. Jane Stuart's father and mother were
<PB N="89" REF="99">
dead, and &s;he had the inn to her&s;elf.&mdash;Next day I told Mr. Scott, whom I &s;ucceed|ed, what Mr. Hamilton &s;aid concerning Jane Stuart. Mr. Scott &s;aid, he thought if you was to marry Jane Stuart, he would have you then to go with him always when he went into the &s;hire of Galloway.</P>
<P>About the beginning of November we &s;et out for Edinburgh, on my ma&s;ter's way to London. Lady Anne accompanied my ma&s;|ter in a coach to Hamilton. There was one place of the road that was dangerous, where the company commonly walked on foot. My ma&s;ter walked on, and Lady Anne's &s;ervants went to carry her out of the dirty road into the footway. She would not let <HI>them</HI> do this office, but called me to carry her. When we came to New-Mills, near the Earl of Loudon's hou&s;e, the inn where we &s;topped belonged to the Earl of Loudon's head cook, who&s;e two daughters kept it. He took no
<PB N="90" REF="100">
account of it him&s;elf. Half a year before this the mother bad died, and the two girls were left alone. We knew one another from children. After dinner Mr. Hamilton called Jane Robe, (her father's name was Robe,) into the other room, and &s;poke &s;omething to her. About half an hour after that, the wo|man cook called for me into the garden, and told me &s;he heard I was going from Mr. Ha|milton's. Now, &s;aid &s;he, as I have known you a long time, if you will take my advice, I will tell you how you may do your&s;elf good all your life. How, &s;aid I? By making love to Mi&s;s Robe; and I am &s;ure &s;he will have you, if you make love in a re&s;pectful manner. I had no de&s;ire; but I told her I would come back and make love in a few days. When I had left my ma&s;ter I went in and called the two Mi&s;s Robes to drink a gla&s;s of wine with me. That was the be&s;t chance I ever had in my life, if I had embraced it. We &s;et off for Edinburgh the day that my ma&s;ter
<PB N="91" REF="101">
was to &s;et out for London, to join the parlia|ment. My &s;ucce&s;&s;or came to his place. Mr. Hamilton told him to go and order a po&s;t|chai&s;e and &s;addle hor&s;e, at John Bell's, his former coachman. I &s;hall go to Rock Vale, my hou&s;e in Ea&s;t Lothian, and to Dunbar at night. If you have any bu&s;ine&s;s to do in town, come to Dunbar any time this even|ing. I &s;hall take John Macdonald with me all day, and he can return with the chai&s;e in the morning.</P>
<P>When I returned to Edinburgh, in a day or two after, I went to live with Colonel Skeene, till the &s;ervant he had hired could come home. At this time I vi&s;ited a per&s;on that had lived fellow &s;ervant with me at Bar|geny. He lived with Mrs. Dalrymple, wife to Colonel Dalrymple, Governor of Guada|loupe. The French governe&s;s was turned away on my account, and afterwards the hou&s;ekeeper Then a report went through

Edinburgh concerning me. Colonel Skeene told me of it, when his &s;ervant came home, and de&s;ired me to go to London and get a place; for no family here, &s;aid the Colonel, will hire you, for fear of their women. And the &s;ervants in Edinburgh &s;aid, Damn you, Macdonald, I &s;uppo&s;e when you was born, you was thrown into a woman's &s;hift, and that the women and you are &s;till &s;triving for it. I went after the Earl of Aboyne's &s;er|vice. The Lady a&s;ked my name. They &s;aid if they wanted me they would &s;end for me. I went next to a Mr. Campbell, who, being newly married, refu&s;ed me.</P>
<P>I have often heard the ladies &s;ay, as they were walking along the &s;treets of Edinburgh, one to another, Is that him? Yes, &s;ays ano|ther. I always went very clean, for I de|lighted in dre&s;s and powder. My name was commonly the French Macdonald. When I went into Mrs. Bell's one day, I told her
<PB N="93" REF="105">
what I heard the ladies &s;ay in the &s;treet.&mdash;She &s;aid, if you don't take care, the women will be your ruin. I &s;aid to her, you have known me from the year 1750; pray tell me what you think? What makes the women take to me &s;o? Johnny, &s;aid Mrs. Bell, there is nothing in it, further than this; they think you have &s;o good a temper, and never hear you &s;ay an ill word: and you are &s;o obliging in your way; for a di&s;agreeable word will turn away the affections. But you are always prai&s;|ing their beauty. There was Duke Hamilton, that married Mi&s;s Gunning. He was very debauched in bad women's company; but among&s;t ladies he was one of the polite&s;t and be&s;t behaved men in Great Britain. And there is nothing that gains the affection of women, &s;o &s;oon as to be always obliging to them.</P>
<P>I thought I &s;hould never get a place; but Montgomery, the hair dre&s;&s;er, told me to
<PB N="94" REF="106">
go to Major Joa&s;s, facing the Trone Church. He wants a &s;ervant; make u&s;e of my name, as he &s;poke to me. I went to the Major in the morning&mdash;Sir, I hear you want a &s;ervant.&mdash;Yes, I do. After &s;everal que&s;tions he hired me. He a&s;ked me, who would give me a character? Sir, I believe Mr. Charles Dal|rymple, brother to Mr. Hamilton of Bargeny.&mdash;Very well, call on me to-morrow. When I came, the Major &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;hall take you for my &s;ervant, for you mu&s;t live with a &s;ingle gentleman: no family will admit you into their hou&s;e.

<P>At the hou&s;e where we lodged there was a pretty girl, called Kitty Hamilton. There was no other per&s;on in the hou&s;e. Her mi&s;|tre&s;s lived at another hou&s;e, where gentle|men lodged. We breakfa&s;ted and drank tea
<PB N="95" REF="107">
in the afternoon together every day. She told me, this gentleman and the other offer|ed her one guinea; another two; another five. I &s;aid to her, this reminds me of a cir|cum&s;tance where I was born. A young man loved a girl. He &s;aid, I &s;hould be glad to go to bed with you, my dear Jenny. She &s;aid, you fool!

I laid her on the bed, and began toying with her.&mdash;She &s;creamed out. At that in&s;tant, a woman and two men were coming down the &s;tairs. They all came in, and &s;aid, &s;ir, are you going to ra|vi&s;h the young woman? I was very much afraid, when they &s;urrounded me, and were going to take me into cu&s;tody.

I went after my ma&s;ter, the Major, in the chai&s;e to Tulli|bodie. One day, at dinner, one of the hou&s;e|maids &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ever &s;ince the Major came here, our young ladies lock them&s;elves in their rooms: Is it for fear of the Major, or his man?"</Q> It went round the table as a joke. We returned to our lodging in Edin|burgh, and, after &s;taying a month, &s;et off for London, in the year 1762, and remained till the beginning of June, when we &s;et off for Che&s;ter, and then through Wales to Ho|lyhead.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter was much delighted with the country, and the fine weather. The Major travelled very &s;lowly, and every place we came to he had the harp played to him. At Holywell we &s;taid one day, at Connoway we

&s;taid two, and by a contrary wind we were detained at Holyhead one week.</P>
<P>We &s;et &s;ail in the packet for Dublin, and landed at Dunlary, in company with &s;everal gentlemen. We all breakfa&s;ted there. We hired two hackney coaches to bring the com|pany to town, and a cart for the luggage.&mdash;The gentlemen came out and went into the coaches, but the coachman of the fir&s;t coach, where the Major was &s;eated, was not in the way. My ma&s;ter &s;aid, John, get on the box and drive on. I did &s;o. By and by Dunnie Patrick got on the &s;econd coach, and they di|rected me which way to go for the four miles. When we drove through Dublin, along E&s;&s;ex Bridge, near the Hotel, the coach I drove broke down, and Dunnie Patrick came up in &s;uch a fright! but he &s;aw it was not my fault. The gentlemen crawled out of the upper window, and &s;aid, it is John's fault.&mdash;Another, why did John drive? But the Ma|jor

<P>We walked up to the hotel, and, as it was Sunday, &s;taid all day. Next day we went to lodge in Margaret-&s;treet, at a cabinet maker's. The mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e was a Londoner. The ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s were both civil, and I was very happy; for my ma&s;ter dre&s;&s;ed af|ter breakfa&s;t: I &s;eldom &s;aw him any more till night. He was among&s;t his old friends, for he had lived &s;ixteen years in Ireland, in the Scotch Royals, and in Colonel Bag&s;haw's re|giment. He was the be&s;t of ma&s;ters. I very often walked about Dublin, one of the plea|&s;ante&s;t

places in Europe. The Major had very often tickets that he did not make u&s;e of, &s;o he gave them to me; and I, being out of livery, could go to Smock-alley, the Royal Play-hou&s;e, the Garden, and Marlborough|green. When it was wet I employed my time in reading books and peru&s;ing maps, of which the Major had a great many. He en|tru&s;ted me to mea&s;ure the di&s;tance of one place from another, by the &s;cale. My ma&s;|ter had always plenty of fine tea, of which I drank &s;ome in the afternoon, and with which I treated the maid, and the maid al&s;o at the next hou&s;e, where a gentleman lived, who had a natural daughter. The maid brought her in to &s;ee the books and maps, with which &s;he was much delighted. I a&s;ked her to drink tea; and as I behaved civilly, and appeared genteel, &s;he drank tea, and went out a walking with me; and to Smock-alley, and the Royal Play-hou&s;e. The two maids were very well plea&s;ed to &s;ee her go out with me.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="113">
Next day the Major went to lodge where he had lodged before, in a very plea&s;ant &s;itu|ation, at the corner of Keppel-&s;treet. We could lie in our beds and &s;ee the people walk along E&s;&s;ex Bridge. Our landlord was a Mr. Hender&s;on, who kept a &s;eed &s;hop. He was a Scotchman, and was very fond of me. I cut the children's hair. The mi&s;tre&s;s let the two little boys, and the two little girls, walk out with me. Mr. Hender&s;on told me he had a large &s;eed garden near Bloody-bridge, and that, if I cho&s;e, I might walk there with the children. As it amu&s;ed me I went with them. There was the greate&s;t plenty that a garden could produce. It was all for &s;eed. Nothing was &s;old or u&s;ed but what he had in his own hou&s;e. I brought nothing away in my pockets but cucumbers and onions.</P>
<P>It was always in the afternoon that we went; and, as I had the children in compa|ny, I went boldly to Margaret-&s;treet, to a&s;k

Mi&s;s Edgworth to go with us. She was glad of the opportunity, for &s;he ate what fruit &s;he plea&s;ed, and we brought her to her own door, which was on our way. When the Major dined in the country I went with him to many &s;eats; the Earl of Rothes's, Mr. Connoly's, and many other hou&s;es.</P>
<P>I thought my&s;elf in Paradi&s;e, there is &s;uch living; and the Iri&s;h &s;ervants are &s;uch hearty fellows! They looked upon me as one of their own country, being of the name of Mac|donald, for that is a great name in Ireland.&mdash;When my ma&s;ter and Mr. Lowrie, Chaplain to the Royal Scots, and we two &s;ervants left Dublin, we travelled in two chai&s;es, and our baggage went by &s;ea. It is needle&s;s to men|tion any little village we &s;topped at. We &s;topped all night at Lu&s;k, and next night at Duleek; and pa&s;&s;ed through a fine country as a man could wi&s;h to &s;ee. Duleek was out of the high-road, but my ma&s;ter wanted to
<PB N="103" REF="115">
take leave of his old friends, as he had been &s;o long in Ireland, and did not expect to come back again.</P>
<P>Next day we cro&s;&s;ed the Water of Boyne, and dined at Drogheda. Major Joa&s;s &s;hewed me where the battle was fought, and the &s;tone where King William's royal &s;tandard was &s;et up. At night we &s;topped at Dun|leer, a plea&s;ant town. Next night we &s;top|ped at Dundalk. Next day we pa&s;&s;ed by Newry mountains, formerly famous for ro|bers. We &s;topped all night at the plea&s;ant town of Newry, and next night at Banbridge. We dined next day at Hil&s;borough; as it was a fair day, and a great deal of merry|making, the Major &s;topped all night among&s;t his friends. In the morning we &s;et out for Belfa&s;t, where we &s;topped all night; one of the plea&s;ante&s;t towns in Ireland, at the head of the lake of Carrickfergus. Next day we went to Donaghadee; from whence we were
<PB N="104" REF="116">
to take our pa&s;&s;age for Scotland. We wait|ed one day for the ve&s;&s;el. I went a walking by the &s;ea-&s;ide to look at the beauty of the country. I &s;aid to my&s;elf, what can be the rea&s;on that noblemen and gentlemen don't come to &s;ee the three kingdoms, before they go on their travels, and become acquainted with their own country before they go abroad? It would be of &s;ervice to their edu|cation, and their future experience. We landed at Port-patrick, in the &s;hire of Gal|way, after a pa&s;&s;age of twenty-four hours.&mdash;We breakfa&s;ted there, and went to dinner at the borough of Stranraer, where I had my freedom when living with Mr. Hamilton; and where almo&s;t all the children knew me. In the afternoon we went along the &s;ea-&s;ide, and acro&s;s the hills, eighteen miles to the town of Ballantree, the whole of which be|longed to Mr. Hamilton. Next day we went to Girvan, fourteen miles di&s;tant, and dined at the inn belonging to Jane Stuart. After

dinner as we were looking out of the window Dennis O'Flaghan, Mr. Lowrie's &s;ervant, a&s;ked me, pray now John is this hill in the &s;ea? is this now the very hill we left at Port Patrick? Yes, &s;aid I, Dennis, that is the i&s;land of Ail&s;a. Devil take me, &s;aid Dennis, but that hill has travelled as fa&s;t as we have done for the&s;e two days. What made him think &s;o was, that the land came partly round the i&s;land.</P>
<P>At night we &s;tayed at Daily, a village near Bargeny, where I formerly went to &s;chool. In the morning before breakfa&s;t, as we were preparing to go away, Mr. Charles Dalrym|ple, as he was riding to the mineral waters near this place, &s;aw the Major and me. He was the gentleman that gave the Major my character. He &s;aid, Major, is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee you here? It is, &s;aid the Major. They breakfa&s;ted together, and Mr. Dalrymple took the Major to dine with him at Bargeny:
<PB N="106" REF="118">
&s;o I &s;aw the place once more and the people; and Mr. Hamilton ordered me a bowl of punch after dinner. At night we arrived in Air at Mr. Duff's, for Mr. Duff was a relation of the Major's. From Air we &s;et out for Stirling, through Gla&s;gow, about the end of Augu&s;t. The Major took the command in the ca&s;tle of Stirling; he had a fine hou&s;e in the ca&s;tle, well furni&s;hed, and plenty of liquor. His aunt in Edinburgh hired two elderly &s;ervants, a cook and a hou&s;ekeeper. The Major made one of the &s;oldiers footman and groom, and employed another to clean knives and a&s;&s;i&s;t in the hou&s;e; &s;o we began hou&s;e|keeping. The gentlemen round Stirling came to &s;ee the Major as he was coming to &s;ettle among&s;t them, and a&s;ked him to come and &s;ee them at their hou&s;es. The Major gave the gentlemen and ladies in Stirling|&s;hire a ball and &s;upper in the town of Stir|ling. In the morning when we came home, he &s;aid, John, which of the ladies took your

fancy? Mi&s;s Fairly, Sir.&mdash;I'll be damn'd but that is the one I took notice of; and he laughed heartily, for he was of that free and merry turn. I never knew him angry in my life. Often, after he was in bed, he would make me &s;tand half an hour &s;peaking about things, after I had got the candle in my hand to go out of the room. After this, Colonel Ma&s;terton gave another great ball. All we &s;ervants that waited had a card hung at our bo&s;om, for that is the cu&s;tom in Scotland.</P>
<P>We went to Edinburgh &s;ometimes for &s;ix weeks together; and at other times to gen|tlemen's hou&s;es. A plea&s;ant life we had. When he was going to Edinburgh, oftentimes a gentleman would want to go in the chai&s;e with him, and offer to pay half-price; but he always determined to go &s;ooner or later than the time propo&s;ed. When he came home, he would tell me &s;uch a one was de|&s;irous of accompanying him; but he would
<PB N="108" REF="120">
not con&s;ent, as he was determined at all times to be ma&s;ter of the carriage in which he travelled. I always rode in the chai&s;e with him.</P>
<P>When the Major had company in the Ca&s;tle, after breakfa&s;t was over, and he was dre&s;&s;ed, I u&s;ually put on a wai&s;tcoat with &s;leeves, with a white apron, and cook's knife &s;tuck before me. Thus equipped, I would go into the parlour, to a&s;k the Major what he would plea&s;e to have for dinner. The din|ner he wanted was ordered, and I appeared at dinner at the &s;ide-table. The gentlemen &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Major, I never knew a &s;ervant like your's; you mu&s;t certainly give him great wages."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"That I do, indeed, I give him great wages."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What country is he of, Major?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"He is one of the Macdonalds of Inverne&s;s&s;hire."</Q>&mdash;The hou&s;ekeeper was one of the be&s;t common cooks in Scotland, and &s;he was up to the go&s;&s;ip in the parlour;
<PB N="109" REF="121">
for the gentlemen thought I was the cook: &s;he and I were upon very good terms; and if &s;he had, now and then, a gla&s;s of good old Port, and &s;ome fine tea in the afternoon, all was well&mdash;and that we had. But every thing in time has an end; for the Major was courting Mi&s;s Abercromby, of Tullibodie, whom he afterwards married. I told the Major, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I hear you are going to be mar|ried to Mi&s;s Abercromby; and, Sir, &s;ervants that live with &s;ingle gentlemen are not good family &s;ervants; &s;o, Sir, if you plea&s;e to get a &s;ervant by the fifteenth day of May, and I &s;hall go a little further."</Q> He was &s;orry to take my warning; but rea&s;on bore the &s;way, he was reconciled at la&s;t, and hired a &s;ervant in the country.</P>
<P>At the time appointed I was paid off, and came to Edinburgh. Near the end of May, 1763, I took my pa&s;&s;age in a &s;hip for Lon|don, and left all my friends behind me.
<PB N="110" REF="122">
When I had been a week in London, I met the Iri&s;h Chairman that carried Mr. Hamil|ton and Major Joa&s;s when in London. I &s;aid to him, Do you hear of any place for me? By G&mdash;d, Johnny, I do; go to Major Libbelier; he lodges at a hair-dre&s;&s;er's in Lower Gro&s;venor-&s;treet; go to him, Johnny, early to-morrow morning.&mdash;I went&mdash;the maid told him I was below.&mdash;Call him up.&mdash;Well, Sir, what are your commands? Were you ever in Ireland? Look to my recommendations.&mdash;He read them, and &s;aid, I know Colonel Skene, and Major Joa&s;s in particular. Then you have been through Ireland?&mdash;I have, Sir.&mdash;Very well, I'll give you fourteen &s;hillings a week; and, if I go to Ireland, I'll give you &s;ixpence more a day on the road.&mdash;Sir, I agree.&mdash;I dre&s;&s;ed him, and he was plea&s;ed. He called the maid, and &s;aid to her, You mu&s;t make a bed for John, and I &s;hall account for it;&mdash;and, John, you'll call me every morning at
<PB N="111" REF="123">
&s;even o'clock, for I go out at nine. Sir, do you want any thing more of me to-day? No. I came home at night, and &s;aid to the maid, Shall I &s;it up for the Major? She &s;aid, There is no occa&s;ion, he comes home before we go to bed, and all he wants is to light his candle. He is a very &s;ober gentleman. So I &s;erved him two hours each day. He paid me my money every week. About the end of June we &s;et out in a chai&s;e for Che&s;ter, in our way to Dublin. The Major hired hor&s;es through Wales to Holyhead, and we &s;oon had our pa&s;&s;age for Dublin, where I &s;aw all my old friends. I had all the day to my&s;elf, as in London. The Major was a polite man. If he met me in the &s;treets of Dublin, and I lifted my hat, he returned it; but no more. One thing I can &s;ay, I never &s;erved him with a breakfa&s;t, dinner, or &s;upper, all the time I lived with him. When Major Libbelier was on the road, he &s;ent me from his table what he left; and of every bottle of wine, he
<PB N="112" REF="124">
&s;ent me a tumbler gla&s;s full. Near the end of Augu&s;t he di&s;charged me, having no fur|ther occa&s;ion for a &s;ervant after he returned from Dublin.</P>
<P>Next week I called at Mr. Lamare's, in Holles-&s;treet, Cavendi&s;h-&s;quare, for Daniel Douglas, who lived fellow-&s;ervant with me at Bargeny. I told him I had left Major Libbelier: he &s;aid, I wi&s;h you had been here ye&s;terday, for the ba&s;ket-woman told us of a place. But, &s;aid he to the cook, if Ma&s;ter John will wait a little, the woman will be here from the butcher's pre&s;ently. When &s;he came, &s;he told me to enquire for Major Deibbiege, at Mr. Sandby's; he wanted a &s;ervant. I went, and was hired. He gave me a livery. He was ju&s;t come out of Scotland, and had married a Scotch lady, Mi&s;s Seton, Sir Henry Seton's &s;i&s;ter. Soon after, my ma&s;ter made the tour of Norfolk, to &s;ee his relations. He went to Newmarket Races,
<PB N="113" REF="125">
Swaffham Races and A&s;&s;embly, Raynham Hall, Holkham Hall, Houghton Hall, Nor|wich, Lynn, and many other places in the county. From the &s;ingularity of my livery, they a&s;ked me, if my ma&s;ter was not an am|ba&s;&s;ador. I told them he was an American &s;calp.</P>
<P>When we had &s;een all the places about Norfolk, we returned to London. I lived with the Major till after Chri&s;tmas. He was not going to have a carriage; and, as I did not like a family &s;o well, I gave warning.</P>
<P>In March, 1764, I heard of a place in Al|dermanbury, and went after it. Two &s;ingle gentlemen, Mr. Fergu&s;on, brother to Sir Adam Fergu&s;on, and Mr. Creighton, lived to|gether. Many others came after this place as well as me; but, as Mr. Fergu&s;on was born in the pari&s;h where I lived when I was at Bargeny, and by that had a little know|ledge
<PB N="114" REF="126">
of me, I had the preference. I was hired for twenty guineas a year, and two &s;uits of cloaths: they told me they did not want me to wear a livery. I went to their taylor, and was mea&s;ured for one of fu&s;tian, to do my work in, and another of blue York|&s;hire cloth; I did not want to be fine. I wanted to be like a &s;ervant. The gentlemen were plea&s;ed with what I ordered, when they &s;aw them. As Mr. Hamilton was in London, he gave me a character. I entered home, liked my place, and was very capable of it. I was part of every thing there. I marketed, kept the book, and had the keys of every thing in the hou&s;e. I was &s;teward, valet, butler, hou&s;e-keeper, head-cook, and footman. I taught the maid to dre&s;s the Scotch di&s;hes. When &s;he wanted a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he had her &s;i&s;ter, a married woman, to help her; and I paid her as a chair-woman. We went on very well, and had always the Sunday to our&s;elves. Mr. Andrew Grant,
<PB N="115" REF="127">
of Broad-&s;treet, had a hou&s;e at Horn&s;ey. The two gentlemen went there on Saturday night, and returned on Monday morning. When it was my Sunday to go out, the maid had her &s;i&s;ter with her. We were very careful. We had always tea and &s;ugar allowed us. When I was at home, I had &s;ometimes one or another that came to &s;ee me. This went on near a year, and I was determined to take more care of my&s;elf than I had done, think|ing on what was pa&s;t; and I made a vow to this purpo&s;e. But no man can fore&s;ee what is to come. As I was going to bed, the maid's room and bed facing the &s;tairs as I came up, &s;he in bed, and the candle burn|ing, I could &s;ee her at different times unco|vered. I went to bed once or twice, and took no notice. But one night the candle was very near the bed, and &s;he nearly all uncovered: very tempting to a man; for &s;he was a pretty young girl. I &s;poke to her, and told her the danger of leaving a candle
<PB N="116" REF="128">
burning, and falling a&s;leep; &s;o I put it out, and came away. From that time &s;he could never bear to &s;ee me. A few weeks after, on a Saturday night, the gentlemen told me they were to &s;leep at Mr. Bogle's, in Love-lane, and that I &s;hould bring linen and dre&s;s them by eight in the morning, becau&s;e they were to dine at Richmond. I got up at &s;even, which was rather &s;oon, to go to the gentle|men. I therefore took the key of the door, and went over to the public-hou&s;e, to have &s;omething to drink. I had enough at home, but I did not care a farthing for it, as there was no company. Near eight I came home. The door was bolted. Su&s;an went to bed again. She wanted to make me di&s;appoint my ma&s;ters. I knocked and alarmed the &s;treet till near eleven. I got in, but &s;aid nothing. I went to the gentlemen, and, as God would have it, they were late up, and did not want to dre&s;s till after breakfa&s;t. When I came home, the maid's &s;i&s;ter was
<PB N="117" REF="129">
come, as it was my day to go out. I told her how Su&s;an had &s;erved me in the morn|ing. She was very &s;orry, as I was &s;o good a friend to them. We had many words, and &s;he &s;truck me on the face. This &s;o enraged me that I kicked her back&s;ide, and there was great confu&s;ion. I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, and went out for the day. Next morning &s;he told Mr. Fergu&s;on what I had done; how I gave the wine in the kitchen to people; and that, when I made the Scotch &s;oup, if it was not made u&s;e of, I warmed it up next day, if they dined at home, and charged it again. My ma&s;ter told Mr. Creighton; and after they were dre&s;&s;ed, I was called up into the office. My two ma&s;ters were there, and the two clerks. Mr. Fergu&s;on &s;aid, John, Su&s;an tells me &s;trange things of you, which I am &s;orry to hear; &s;he &s;ays you &s;truck her.&mdash;Yes, but &s;he &s;truck me fir&s;t.&mdash;Call her in.&mdash;I did.&mdash;Well, Su&s;an, did John &s;trike you?&mdash;Yes, and if he &s;tays in the hou&s;e I will not.&mdash;I

I knocked and walked there till eleven o'clock; then Su&s;an let me in. I got the things, and dre&s;&s;ed you both. Ye&s;terday, when I came back from Mr. Bo|gle's, I told her &s;i&s;ter how &s;he had &s;erved me.

You know, Sir, I always had cold &s;ir|loin of beef, or haunch-bone, or buttock, and you had &s;omething of fi&s;h or of fowl, Now the &s;oup that was made the day before &s;aved us from the trouble of going for any thing el&s;e. Sir, that is all the view I had in it, not to have to go out.</P>
<P>Bring me your book, &s;aid my ma&s;ter, and the butcher's bills, and I &s;hall &s;peak to you both by and by. They both examined the book and the bills, but could find nothing again&s;t me. We were called in again. Su|&s;an was told that they could find nothing concerning what &s;he &s;aid of the &s;oups;&mdash;&s;o you may provide your&s;elf with another place; for, as you cannot agree any longer, it is be&s;t to part. She went, and a cunning devil came after her. I believe the two were ac|quainted, for they met very often together.

The new maid had a &s;weetheart, a porter in a &s;hop, though &s;he cared no more for him than for my old &s;hoes. She a&s;ked me to give them a gla&s;s of wine, for &s;he knew the other had wine often. But I would not. I told Colonel Roy's butler how Su&s;an had &s;erved me. He &s;aid, what can you do? Never give a gla&s;s of wine to any per&s;on. If any one comes to &s;ee you, treat them with a pot of porter or two, but always take care of your tru&s;t; for, if you do not, the fir&s;t time you have words, they'll tell of you. So I went by his advice. I had to teach her to dre&s;s the Scotch di&s;hes. One night I went to &s;ee Mr. Bogle's &s;ervants. The butler and footboy &s;aid, Mr. John, the gentlemen were &s;peaking about you la&s;t night. Mr. Fer|gu&s;on &s;aid, Mr. Hamilton turned away my poor John for fear of his wife. Mr. John, did you live at Bargeny?&mdash;Yes, I did.&mdash;Then we under&s;tand; for Mr. Hamilton and Lady Anne are parted.&mdash;That is not my fault,
<PB N="122" REF="134">
&s;aid I.&mdash;A few nights after, Captain Hamil|ton was at &s;upper with Mr. Fergu&s;on, and the di&s;cour&s;e turned about Lady Anne. The Captain a&s;ked what was the rea&s;on? Was &s;he blamed with taking up with any per&s;on? As I was going out of the room, my ma&s;ter &s;aid, with him fir&s;t.&mdash;What, with your &s;er|vant?&mdash;Yes.&mdash;The Captain &s;aid, Damn it, it is a pity tho&s;e things are ever known. Did he live there?&mdash;He was brought up in the family.&mdash;I was &s;orry to bear the blame, and innocent at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Next our maid began her &s;chemes. One night, before bed-time, &s;he was taken very ill, and, as I thought, fainted away. I got her &s;omething to drink, and &s;he came to her|&s;elf. She was &s;o weak that &s;he could not walk to bed. I was obliged to carry her. When we came there, &s;he could not undre&s;s her&s;elf. I was obliged to undre&s;s her, and to take off her &s;tockings.&mdash;Dear, how bad I
<PB N="123" REF="135">
am, Ma&s;ter John.&mdash;I am very &s;orry for you, Ellie.&mdash;Pray put &s;ome water by my bed &s;ide before you lie down. I did, and went to bed. Another night &s;he behaved in the &s;ame manner. I was proof again&s;t her; nor in|deed did I under&s;tand her till afterwards; for I had not the craft of many. From this day &s;he became my enemy. What a terrible thing is lu&s;t! How terrible, when di&s;ap|pointed!</P>
<P>One day the gentlemen dined at Mr. Grant's in Broad-&s;treet. I went to the St. James's end of the town with Mr. Duff's &s;ervant. We called at different hou&s;es, and drank &s;everal liquors, which got the better of my head. Hugh Gib&s;on came home with me, and bad me good night. I went down to the kitchen, and &s;at down in a chair. The heat of the fire made me &s;ick. I puked, and fell a&s;leep. Ellie &s;hut the kitchen door, &s;o that I could not hear the &s;treet door knock.
<PB N="124" REF="136">
She went to the next hou&s;e, and &s;at with the maid. She expected my ma&s;ter home in the evening to write; and &s;o he did come, and knocked &s;everal times; but I did not hear him. Then &s;he came to the door, and told my ma&s;ter &s;he left me at home with Mr. Duff's &s;ervant. She took Mr. Fergu&s;on to the kitchen to &s;ee me as I was fa&s;t a&s;leep. Now, Sir, you &s;ee how your wine lies on the hearth. He &s;aid nothing, but went up to the office. When I went to put him to bed, he &s;aid, John, I &s;ee how you behave; a per|&s;on I put &s;o much confidence in, and to u&s;e me &s;o!&mdash;Sir, I beg your pardon; I went to the other end of the town, and drank dif|ferent liquors, which got the better of me, and Mr. Duff's man came home with me, and I fell a&s;leep by the fire, and I became very &s;ick.&mdash;Did not you get drunk at home?&mdash;No, Sir; I drank nothing at home but part of a pot of beer, when Hugh Gib&s;on came home with me.&mdash;I can hardly believe
<PB N="125" REF="137">
you.&mdash;I do a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, it is true. My ma&s;ter went next day to Mr. Duff's &s;ervant, to know the rights of it; and as I &s;poke, &s;o he found it. So this pa&s;&s;ed over.</P>
<P>Soon after there were ladies and gentlemen dined at our hou&s;e. I gave Ellie a bottle of wine for her&s;elf. She drank &s;ome wine and porter, and by noon got drunk. The chair|woman &s;aid, Mrs. Cook, the pot boils; will you &s;kim the pot? Ellie was going to wa&s;h her hands, and having the &s;oap in her hands, &s;he lifted off the lid, and went to &s;kim the pot. The &s;oap fell in the pot. I took it out with the ladle. It was the Queen of Scots &s;oup &s;he was making. If it had been &s;poiled, I &s;hould have been blamed; and if it was good, I &s;hould have had prai&s;e.</P>
<P>The Queen of Scots &s;oup is made in man|ner following. Six chickens are cut in &s;mall pieces, with the heart, gizzard, and liver well
<PB N="126" REF="138">
wa&s;hed, and then put into a &s;tewpan, and ju&s;t covered with water, and boiled till the chickens are enough. Sea&s;on it with &s;alt and cayenne pepper, and mince par&s;ley with eight eggs yolks and whites beat up toge|ther. Stir round all together ju&s;t as you are going to &s;erve it up. Half a minute will boil the eggs.</P>
<P>By the time dinner was &s;ent in, Ellie &s;at down in a chair, and being overcome by the heat of the fire, fell fa&s;t a&s;leep, and was as bad as I had been &s;ome time before. So ever after we never did agree. Now it was reported that Mr. Fergu&s;on was going to be married to Mi&s;s Fordyce, Mr. Andrew Grant's Lady's &s;i&s;ter; and &s;o he was, &s;ome time after. I went to Mr. Grant's one day to &s;ee the &s;ervants. The hou&s;ekeeper, Mrs. Gordon, a&s;ked me if I did not live with the Earl of Crauford, and Mr. Hamilton of Bar|geny. I &s;aid, Yes. Are they not both part|ed
<PB N="127" REF="139">
from their ladies? I &s;aid, Yes.&mdash;Little did I know what was brewing.</P>
<P>The maid began to dre&s;s away. Some mornings &s;he would not have a &s;hilling to buy &s;ugar or tea, but would borrow from me. At night &s;he would go out, and come home with gold and &s;ilver in her pocket. One day we had words, and I told her I did not think &s;he got her money hone&s;tly. She went cry|ing to Mr. Creighton, and told him that I &s;aid &s;he went out of nights along with him. He told Mr. Fergu&s;on. They were both very angry; and I got warning; but after|wards &s;he lived with him, and had children by him. The fir&s;t time I &s;aw Mr. Grant's footman, he &s;aid, John, I hear you are going away.&mdash;Yes, &s;aid I, on Ellie's account.&mdash;Not altogether for that, Ma&s;ter John; the ladies &s;ay you are not a proper per&s;on to live where there are married people.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="140">
When my time was up, I was di&s;charged; and &s;oon after I was hired to a gentleman in the city, ju&s;t married, who knew my ma&s;ter. When I went for my an&s;wer, he told me he was &s;orry he could not take me, as a relation had recommended a &s;ervant to him, and he could not be off taking him. So I lo&s;t that place, and was out of &s;ervice till I had &s;pent all my money, to the la&s;t five and three|pence. At la&s;t a hair-dre&s;&s;er &s;ent me after a place, to be butler and dre&s;s hair, with a gentleman in Kent, and to wear a livery. The gentleman went after my character. I went for my an&s;wer. He &s;aid, I went to en|quire about you, and your ma&s;ter did not give you a very good character; but I will take you by your looks. I went home, and liked my place well. I dre&s;&s;ed my ma&s;ter and his lady. My ma&s;ter kept the be&s;t hou&s;e in England; he was a powder-merchant for the army. There were three more &s;ervants in livery. By the time I was half a year
<PB N="129" REF="141">
there, the hou&s;ekeeper rai&s;ed a report that I had taken up with the chamber-maid in the country-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We jaunted round the country a good deal, in E&s;&s;ex, Kent, and Hamp&s;hire. One day, in town, my mi&s;tre&s;s de&s;ired the hou&s;ekeeper to &s;end me up &s;tairs, as &s;he was going to &s;end me out to buy &s;omething for her. I a&s;ked her which room my mi&s;tre&s;s was in. She &s;aid the bed-chamber. I a&s;ked her if I was to go there. Yes, &s;aid &s;he, you are welcome enough there. I was much alarmed to hear her &s;ay &s;o. If any of the maids &s;aid or &s;poke any thing that di&s;plea&s;ed my mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he came and told me of it. One day, at the country hou&s;e, &s;omething was forgot for din|ner. I took the blame on my&s;elf. My ma&s;ter &s;poke to my mi&s;tre&s;s of it &s;oon after, and &s;he took the blame on her&s;elf. He &s;aid, God damn you both; am I to be di&s;ap|pointed in this manner between you both?
<PB N="130" REF="142">
Such expre&s;&s;ions I was &s;orry to hear. I thought of what was pa&s;t; and I would ra|ther have &s;uffered death than to have been the cau&s;e of di&s;turbance: for I had a great regard for my ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s. So I gave warning to get out of it. One day, in the town hou&s;e, the cook-maid &s;aid, Mr. John, my mi&s;tre&s;s don't know what to do, becau&s;e you are going away; &s;he has not dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf the&s;e three weeks. I was very &s;orry to hear all this; it very much hurt my &s;pirits, and I came away very heavy hearted.</P>
<P>Next I went to live with a Mr. Campbell, for the time he was to be in London, to take care of his things, and dre&s;s him. His bro|ther, Mr. Campbell of Shawfield, lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and his footman was taken very ill. He de&s;ired his valet to a&s;k me, if I would go to the Hou&s;e of Commons behind his carriage, and to put on the livery great|coat?
<PB N="131" REF="143">
I told him I would with all my heart. When my ma&s;ter was dre&s;&s;ed in the morn|ing, and his things put away, he wanted no more of me for the day. I waited on them at breakfa&s;t, and very often at dinner. I lived well. If they dined in the country, I went with them. I was never happier in my own mind. Before my ma&s;ter went away, he bought two hor&s;es, and I got two guineas by that. I lived with Mr. Camp|bell till he left London. He went, in his way to Scotland, by Oxford and Lanca&s;ter, and made &s;everal excur&s;ions, that he might learn the modes of farming.</P>
<P>The week after his departure, I went after a place in St. James's-&s;treet, at a gentleman's ju&s;t come from Paris, one of the gaye&s;t young gentlemen, and the greate&s;t gambler, that every belonged to Scotland, (though he had often &s;aid, he never would have a Scotch &s;ervant, nor employ a Scotch trade&s;man,)
<PB N="132" REF="144">
John Crauford, E&s;q. of Errol. I met him in the pa&s;&s;age, as he was going to his chair, I told him that I heard he wanted a &s;ervant. Who did you live with la&s;t? I told him. He agreed with me for &s;ixteen guineas a year, and half a guinea a week, and &s;aid, Come in the morning. He de&s;ired his valet to give di|rections to Mr. Bocquet the taylor, and he mea&s;ured me for two &s;uits of clothes direct|ly. When I got the livery, he rung the bell for me, and gave me twelve pair of &s;ilk &s;tockings in a parcel to wear; and &s;aid, I like my &s;ervants to go genteelly. A few days after, he a&s;ked my name. I told him John Macdonald.&mdash;What country?&mdash;I &s;aid, from the Highlands of Scotland.&mdash;Very well.</P>
<P>It was now the &s;ummer. We lived in London, and jaunted up and down the coun|try till the winter; and then he remained in London. But, being poorly in his health, he went to Bath in the &s;pring of the year for
<PB N="133" REF="145">
two months; then came to London for &s;ome time; and then returned to Bath again. Doctor Turton thought it mo&s;t advi&s;eable for him to go to the German Spa. At Bath he had words with his valet about the bills. The valet &s;aid to my ma&s;ter, You get wor&s;e and wor&s;e. So he gave him warning. When he came to London, he parted with the Engli&s;hman, and Lord Beauchamp recom|mended him an Italian, a very good fellow, who&s;e name was Henry. We &s;et off for Dover, and pa&s;&s;ed over to Calais. My ma&s;ter took his own chai&s;e with him, which I took care of, to clean and grea&s;e. When we left Calais, my ma&s;ter a&s;ked me, if I could make any broth, as I had boiled him a chicken or a rabbit, with lemon &s;auce, when he did not dine out in London? I told him eight or nine different &s;oups, which I de&s;cribed. But he preferred the Queen of Scots &s;oup, be|cau&s;e, it being the month of May, eggs, chickens, and par&s;ley were ea&s;y to be had.
<PB N="134" REF="146">
So I commonly made him a little of the Queen's &s;oup, which he liked very well. We went po&s;t. At the &s;tage before we came to Li&s;le we &s;lept all night, and went away in the morning, and forgot my ma&s;ter's little trunk, with his money and papers. When we had come three miles, my ma&s;ter a&s;ked me for the trunk. I &s;aid, It mu&s;t be left behind. He de&s;ired me to go back for it. But the French hor&s;e would not leave the chai&s;e for me. I told my ma&s;ter, that, if he would &s;end the po&s;tillion back, I would drive the chai&s;e and four hor&s;es to Li&s;le; which he did. I drove the four &s;tallions the other ten miles. The po&s;tillion did not come up to us for an hour after we arrived in Li&s;le. I drove &s;o fa&s;t, that the people in Li&s;le were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee an Engli&s;hman driving the King of France's po&s;t-hor&s;es. We went on; and when we arrived in Ghent, the people there were making ready for a grand jubilee, which had been preparing for
<PB N="135" REF="147">
half a year. The proce&s;&s;ion was to take place in three days. The Duche&s;s of Nor|thumberland was there, and many other Engli&s;h, and people from all nations in Eu|rope, to &s;ee this grand &s;ight. The Duche&s;s and my ma&s;ter went to &s;ee all the prepara|tions, and all the churches, when ornamented. The beauty of the proce&s;&s;ion was beyond de&s;cription, and a grand ball was given every night, with two bands of mu&s;ic; &s;o that it never &s;topped. We left Ghent; and the next place we &s;topped at for a few days was Bru&s;&s;els, one of the fine&s;t cities in Europe. There were a great many Engli&s;h there. I went to &s;ee Prince Charles's &s;tables, and his guards, and I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find how many Engli&s;h, Scotch, Iri&s;h, and Wel&s;h, were in his light hor&s;e, his guards. At Bru&s;&s;els there are the fine&s;t churches in the world. From this place we came to Liege, a fine large city. Here we remained all night, and next day &s;et out for the Spa, about twenty-five
<PB N="136" REF="148">
miles di&s;tant. At the half-way hou&s;e my ma&s;ter went into the parlour, and ordered dinner, and we &s;ervants remained in the kitchen. Soon after, a Dutch gentleman, his lady, and daughter, came to the inn. They went in with our ma&s;ter to dinner, and we &s;at at dinner in the kitchen with their Dutch footman, in a coar&s;e livery, and a large Dutch hat. He would not &s;it with us, nor take off his hat, but cut &s;ome of the meat and put on his bread, and went into the parlour and eat it, and kept &s;peaking to his ma&s;ter and the ladies, with his large hat on his head, about the roads, the po&s;tillions, and the country. When his meat was done, he came out for another &s;lice, and then went in again. Henry and I laughed till we were like to &s;plit our &s;ides, to think our ma&s;ter was dining with the footman; for Mr. Crau|ford was &s;o proud that he would not let a &s;ervant ride in the chai&s;e with him, but would rather be at the expence of a hor&s;e.
<PB N="137" REF="149">
The gentleman in the parlour was in full dre&s;s, in black &s;ilk cloaths, and wore a dre&s;s hat under his arm. His lady was in a riding|dre&s;s; and the daughter, one of the-fine&s;t young ladies I ever &s;aw, in a riding-dre&s;s, mo&s;t richly trimmed with &s;ilver. They &s;eemed as much plea&s;ed with their foot|man's behaviour as if he had been a prince. We all &s;et off for the German Spa, where we arrived in the evening. There was Prince Ferdinand here, and a great deal of company. The Duke of Roxburgh, Mr. Smith, and our ma&s;ter, kept hou&s;e together at Spa for two months. There is company at this place from all countries in Europe, in the &s;ea&s;on. No gentleman is allowed to wear a &s;word at Spa, by the Prince of Liege's or|ders, who &s;ends part of his guards there, in the &s;ea&s;on, to pre&s;erve the peace. The com|pany &s;pend their time in drinking the water, riding out, walking on the walks, fea&s;ting with one another, playing at cards, in public
<PB N="138" REF="150">
balls, &amp;c. A merry place, much like Bath, in England, for the amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>When two months were over, my ma&s;ter &s;et out for Aix la Chapelle, about thirty miles di&s;tant. We dined half way, at a large town called Veviers. Several plays were acting in the &s;treets, and many other &s;ports were going on. My ma&s;ter walked out to &s;ee them. We left Veviers, and &s;topped at the next inn between that place and Aix la Chapelle all night. There was a great deal of company in the hou&s;e, but the be&s;t room was not engaged. My ma&s;ter was let in there, he being an Engli&s;h gentleman, and &s;upper was ordered. Half an hour after this, a Flemi&s;h lady and her maid arrived in a chai&s;e. She begged to lodge there all night. She was told the rooms were all full. She &s;aid &s;he would make any &s;hift, if there was an empty bed. The landlady &s;aid, they were all taken up where &s;uch a lady as &s;he could
<PB N="139" REF="151">
&s;leep, but one, which was very good, in the clo&s;et of the Engli&s;h gentleman's room.&mdash;Then give Madame Blond's compliments to the Engli&s;h gentleman, and that I de&s;ire the favour he will let me &s;it in the room with him till bed-time. She was going from the Empre&s;s's dominions into France. He was very complai&s;ant, and &s;he came up &s;tairs into the room with all the politene&s;s in the world. She &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;it in his room, as all the apartments were engaged. He &s;aid, &s;he was extremely welcome; and he de&s;ired me to dre&s;s &s;ome of the Queen of Scots &s;oup, if I could get chickens, eggs, and par&s;ley. I &s;aid I could. As for Cayenne pepper, I al|ways had it with me. They went to cards till &s;upper was brought in. The lady liked the &s;oup much. She a&s;ked if I was the Cou&s;i|nier? My ma&s;ter &s;aid, Yes. And I never lo&s;t the name of Cou&s;inier till I came back to England; for I was mo&s;tly every day dre&s;&s;ing one thing or other. After &s;upper,
<PB N="140" REF="152">
her maid and the hou&s;e-maid made the bed in the clo&s;et ready. My ma&s;ter politely &s;aid to her, Madam Blond, if you like, you may have this bed, as it will hold your&s;elf and maid, and I will &s;leep in the clo&s;et. She &s;aid, By no means; I am extremely obliged to you for the privilege of the little bed. Come, Madam, we will play at cards for the large bed. They did &s;o, and &s;he lo&s;t. When the maid came to put her to bed, &s;he gave her maid &s;trict charge to bolt the clo&s;et door. Madam Blond &s;poke to my ma&s;ter in French the whole evening. She bade him good night, and de&s;ired the maid again to be &s;ure to bolt the door: for the bolt was in my ma&s;ter's room. Next day, Madam Blond went to Spa, and Mr. Crauford to Aix la Chapelle, where we remained one month, at the Hotel of Madam Buches. The ball-room was in the &s;ame hotel. There was a ball three times a week. At dinner, every day, there was company of all nations in Europe. My
<PB N="141" REF="153">
ma&s;ter jaunted all round Aix la Chapelle, to different places; a plea&s;ant country as can be, and the merrie&s;t on Sunday in the world. In the public-hou&s;es, dancing and fiddling; in the field, football, and &s;hooting at marks with bows and arrows. The &s;hepherd boys meet in the evenings together, and play on the German flute, which makes it very agree|able as you are riding along the road. When my ma&s;ter left Aix la Chapelle, he &s;et off for Liege, in company with Count Odenonde, with his own &s;addle-hor&s;es and groom. John Pratt, who&s;e brother lived with Earl Spencer, and Henry and I followed in the chai&s;e. We were two nights at Liege. From this place we went to Bru&s;&s;els in the &s;ame manner, and remained there one week. My ma&s;ter &s;ent home his groom and hor&s;es to England, and he went to Paris. At the next &s;tage from Bru&s;&s;els there were only three hor&s;es at home, in the room of four; for the chai&s;e only two, there being &s;o many

pa&s;&s;engers on the road. Henry had one to go on, and the po&s;t-ma&s;ter was obliged to drive my ma&s;ter him&s;elf, with the two hor&s;es. My ma&s;ter took me in the chai&s;e with him|&s;elf, though he never did &s;uch a thing be|fore. I &s;aid nothing. But by and by he a&s;ked me &s;ome que&s;tions. Then I went on, and an&s;wered him in many things that he a&s;ked me. I was &s;o well acquainted with Major Joa&s;s's Hi&s;tory, and his Maps, and what in&s;tructions he gave me in them, that I entertained him a great deal. Next &s;tage he ordered me a hor&s;e, for he thought it be|neath him that I &s;hould ride in the chai&s;e with him. I rode on two &s;tages, and then he took me in again for another &s;tage. He &s;aw I did not intrude to &s;peak till he began him&s;elf. What he a&s;ked me, I an&s;wered. He ordered me a hor&s;e again for two &s;tages, Again I went in the chai&s;e the whole way to Paris. I gave him an hi&s;torical account of the families of Ireland, Scotland, and
<PB N="143" REF="155">
Wales, and a de&s;cription of the country, which I was enabled to do from hi&s;tory and experience in travelling. I gave him an ac|count of his own family for five hundred years back. I &s;aid, Sir, it would be of great &s;ervice to young gentlemen, before they go abroad, to make the tour of Great Britain and Ireland, and there they would &s;ee the &s;eats of heroes; and learn many things, particularly among the people of Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition it is to re&s;pect former things, and learn their hi&s;tory without trou|ble. Sir, they are the mo&s;t rural countries in the world, and the be&s;t &s;upplied with fi&s;h and wild fowl; and they give you a view of mountains, lakes, vallies, hills, and ri|vers; and to travel through tho&s;e coun|tries is the be&s;t thing a young gentleman can do to lay the foundation of experience, by knowing his own country before he goes abroad; for the people of tho&s;e three coun|tries &s;peak about religion, and re&s;pect the
<PB N="144" REF="156">
characters of great men. But here you will hear of nothing but eating and dre&s;s, and plays, and operas. All wickedne&s;s is tole|rated, and the Sunday is not regarded. The Engli&s;h often take up with men's wives, and when the &s;ame mea&s;ure is returned to them, they don't like it; but in Italy and France tho&s;e things are not &s;o much taken notice of.&mdash;My ma&s;ter &s;aid, I would make a good Pre&s;byterian par&s;on.&mdash;In &s;even days we arrived at Paris, and put up at the Hotel de Parc Royal. We lodged on the &s;ame floor with the Prince&s;s of Poniatou&s;ki, and her &s;i&s;ter, a Counte&s;s. They both vi&s;ited my ma&s;ter often. We remained in Paris three months. My ma&s;ter had a coachman, cha|riot, and a French footman. He did not take me behind the carriage, but I got a French ma&s;ter, the &s;ame as I had at the German Spa. I lo&s;t no time to improve my&s;elf. My ma&s;ter gave me a &s;uit of French cloaths, hardly to be known as a livery; &s;o
<PB N="145" REF="157">
I became entirely the Frenchman. I dre&s;&s;ed with my &s;ilk bag every day, and &s;till retained the name of Coufinier, for I dre&s;&s;ed one &s;oup or other every day; and if he dined out, if it was not far off, I took it to him.</P>
<P>One day he had the Duc de Lauzun, Count Lauragay, Count Oudenard, Earl of March, Earl of Carli&s;le, the Earl of Sea|forth, Charles Fox, E&s;q. George Selwyn, E&s;q. the Prince&s;s, and her &s;i&s;ter. My ma&s;ter had always his dinner from the Hotel de Bourbon. But I dre&s;&s;ed the Queen of Scots &s;oup to perfection; it plea&s;ed the company &s;o well, both French and Engli&s;h, that my ma&s;ter next day gave me two louis d'ors. I made different &s;orts of Scots &s;oup; in place of barley, I put rice, and made it very &s;trong of the meat, well &s;ea&s;oned with herbs and cayenne pepper. I called it Soup d'Angle|terre. I taught the Duc de Lauzun's cook to make it. The gentlemen made parties to
<PB N="146" REF="158">
Ver&s;ailles, Chantilly, and St. Cleod; and my ma&s;ter treated Mr. Henry and me to all the playhou&s;es and operas in Paris. I was com|monly in the evening to wait in the way, if my ma&s;ter &s;hould come home to tea. The Prince&s;s had a hou&s;e-maid, a pretty Poli&s;h girl, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her waiting-maid. As &s;he was obliged to be at home, I had her company often to drink tea with me, and to walk out, when time would permit.</P>
<P>In the month of January, 1768, we &s;et off for London. We &s;topped for &s;ome time at Almack's Hou&s;e in Pall-Mall. My ma&s;ter afterwards took Sir James Gray's hou&s;e in Clifford-&s;treet, who was going Amba&s;&s;ador to Spain. He now began hou&s;ekeeping, hired a French cook, a hou&s;e-maid, and kitchen-maid, and kept a great deal of the be&s;t com|pany. My ma&s;ter and Henry had words, and the valet had warning to provide for him&s;elf. About this time Mr. Sterne, the
<PB N="147" REF="159">
celebrated author, was taken ill at the &s;ilk|bag &s;hop in Old Bond-&s;treet. He was &s;ome|times called Tri&s;tram Shandy, and &s;ometimes Yorick; a very great favourite of the gentle|men's. One day my ma&s;ter had company to dinner, who were &s;peaking about him; the Duke of Roxburgh, the Earl of March, the Earl of O&s;&s;ory, the Duke of Grafton, Mr. Garrick, Mr. Hume, and a Mr. James. John, &s;aid my ma&s;ter, go and enquire how Mr. Sterne is to-day. I went, returned, and &s;aid, I went to Mr. Sterne's lodging; the mi&s;tre&s;s opened the door; I enquired how he did? She told me to go up to the nur&s;e. I went into the room, and he was ju&s;t a dy|ing. I waited ten minutes; but in five he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Now it is come.</HI>"</Q> He put up his hand, as if to &s;top a blow, and died in a minute. The gentlemen were all very &s;orry, and la|mented him very much.</P>
<P>When Henry was about going, my ma&s;ter had a &s;ervant recommended to him by a par|ticular
<PB N="148" REF="160">
friend. When I &s;aw him, and found he was hired to be the valet, I was &s;urpri&s;ed that one who had no experience, and was much inferior to my&s;elf, was preferred before me. I was very angry, and told my ma&s;ter &s;o. He &s;aid, He is &s;trongly recommended to me. So I gave my ma&s;ter warning. What is to be mu&s;t be. I had farther to go than &s;top in London. My ma&s;ter had now a foot|man recommended by Colonel Campbell, of Argyle-&s;treet, one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed &s;ervants in London; he &s;poke French, and could dre&s;s hair in perfection; his name was Samuel Cairncro&s;s, afterwards valet to Mr. Seton, the Earl of Panmure, and Earl of Dunmore. Had he been valet, I would have kept my place. So I left Mr. Crawford with two Scotch &s;ervants, though, before I lived with him, he &s;aid, he never would have a Scotch &s;ervant, or a Scotch trade&s;man. Af|ter this the people &s;aid that I brought the Scots into favour.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="161">
I went and lived with Mr. La Motte, the hair-dre&s;&s;er in Rupert-&s;treet, for four months, to bring my hand into hair-dre&s;&s;ing again, for I was out of practice. One day William Boyd, &s;ervant to David Hume, E&s;q. met me and &s;aid, I know of an excellent place for you; as you dre&s;s hair &s;o well, I know you will get the place. The gentleman I have in my eye has been in England five months, and he had a &s;ervant, a countryman of our's, who has behaved extremely ill. He is with my ma&s;ter almo&s;t every day, and he has been in the kingdom of Bengal the&s;e fourteen years. His name is Colonel Dow. He was at Mrs. Elliot's ye&s;terday, and I heard him a&s;k her, if &s;he knew of a good &s;ervant; for James, &s;aid he, has u&s;ed me very ill. Mr. Hume lodged at Mrs. Elliot's, in Brewer-&s;treet, Golden|&s;quare. Go, &s;aid Boyd, to-morrow morning, and enquire for Colonel Dow, and tell him I &s;ent you after his place. I attended in the morning, and went into the parlour. There
<PB N="150" REF="162">
was the Colonel and James Macpher&s;on, E&s;q. They kept hou&s;e together. They a&s;ked me &s;ome que&s;tions. Mr. Macpher&s;on knew my former ma&s;ters, &s;o I was hired at &s;eventeen guineas a year and a livery. The Colonel &s;aid, You may dre&s;s me this morn|ing, and &s;tay till afternoon. After I had dre&s;&s;ed his hair, he gave me two guineas, and &s;aid, That is to buy tea for your&s;elf. I give the maids the &s;ame. As for the boy, what we leave will do for him; and I &s;hall give you my old cloaths, if you plea&s;e me. There was in the Colonel's hou&s;e the greate&s;t plen|ty. Things went on very well, and I had many things given me.</P>
<P>The King of Denmark, about this time, gave his Ma&s;querade in the Opera-Hou&s;e. I dre&s;&s;ed the Colonel and Mr. Macpher&s;on as two Turks. The King and Queen were there that night in private. My ma&s;ter &s;pent &s;o much money on women, that I was tired
<PB N="151" REF="163">
of waiting on them; though if many an hun|gry fellow had had my place, they would have taken care of it, if there had been a thou&s;and ladies. I gave warning merely on that account. My ma&s;ter hired a &s;ervant from Mr. Adams the Architect, a High|lander. The Colonel went after his cha|racter. Mr. Adams gave him a good one. He &s;aid, He is a clean, genteel, good hone&s;t &s;ervant; but &s;ometimes he will get in liquor, and he is given to women.&mdash;Damn him, I like him the better for that. Well, an&s;wered Mr. Adam, he will ju&s;t an&s;wer your purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Macpher&s;on knowing me, and whom I had lived with, recommended me to the Honourable Keith Stewart, brother to the Earl of Galloway, who &s;ent his valet to find me out. He had taken a hou&s;e in Piccadilly, and was going to &s;et up a carriage. He wanted a fervant in livery to dre&s;s him, and
<PB N="152" REF="164">
go out with a vis-a-vis. I went to him and was hired; and as &s;oon as the Colonel's &s;er|vant came home, I went to Mr. Stewart. We had a fine vis-a-vis, and as fine hor&s;es as any in town. Our livery was the genteele&s;t in London, richly trimmed with &s;ilver, and the coachman and grooms turned out as clean as any &s;ervants in London. Mr. Stewart was as good a ma&s;ter as any in London. If a &s;ervant was in fault, when he told him of it, it was only told as advice. He was a great hunter and a great gambler, and as accom|pli&s;hed as any gentleman in Europe. He &s;poke Latin, Italian, and French. He be|longed to Pink&s;ley Hunt. We were there very often, and in Northampton, and at Mr. Knightley's, at Foa&s;ley. The Earl of Gal|loway and Mr. Nightley were married to two &s;i&s;ters, Sir James Da&s;hwood's daughters. It was the plea&s;ante&s;t life in the world to live with him. He never was long in Lon|don at one time, but from one hunt to ano|ther.
<PB N="153" REF="165">
There was not a &s;ervant in a hundred that could have endured the fatigue of his &s;ervice. His hours of coming home were from two to &s;even in the morning. I have had the chai&s;e at the door many a time by &s;ix in the morning, to go to a hunt, before he had come home. When he came, at la&s;t, he would go up &s;tairs, take off his bag, change his dre&s;s cloaths, and go into the chai&s;e. Wherever the hunt was he went, &s;ometimes four&s;core miles. Sometimes I have come &s;eventy or eighty miles by my&s;elf in the chai&s;e to London, and my ma&s;ter with another gentleman in his chai&s;e. We went to Oxford&s;hire, to Blenheim, to Lord Fo|ley's, Lord Thanet's, Stow in the Hole, Cheltenham in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, Hamp&s;hire, and Bedford&s;hire.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant that Colonel Dow had got drunk often. When the gentlemen came home late at night, he would get up to fight

them. The Colonel found he would not an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, for he him&s;elf was ap|pointed by the Company to the Ea&s;t-Indies. He one day called in Brewer-&s;treet, to &s;ee Mr. Hume. Mrs. Elliot &s;aid, Colonel, I hear you are going to the Ea&s;t-Indies again. Yes; but I have got a damned fooli&s;h fellow of a &s;ervant; he gets drunk, quarrels with the hackney-coachmen and chairmen, and knocks them down; they get a warrant for him, and I am obliged to be bail for him. I wi&s;h I had the &s;ervant I had la&s;t, Jack Mac|donald, to go with me. Mrs. Elliot &s;aid, He lives with Mr. Stewart, you cannot have him at this time. I went to &s;ee William Boyd, Mr. Hume's &s;ervant. He &s;aid he was &s;orry I left Colonel Dow, and that the Colonel wanted to &s;ee me. I went and hired my&s;elf, for forty guineas a year, to go with the Colonel to India. I gave Mr. Stewart warning, and told him, I would not leave him upon any account, but to go to India. Who are you
<PB N="155" REF="167">
going with? Sir, I am going with Colonel Dow. Mr. Crauford gave me a character; my ma&s;ter did not know the Colonel. And I &s;aid, Sir, I hope you'll excu&s;e me, as I have a great de&s;ire to go away. What the devil, do you want to go away? I u&s;ed you better than ever I did any other &s;ervant. I let you ride in the chai&s;e with me, and that is more than ever I did to <HI>Carpeneto,</HI> though he was out of livery; and if you were to &s;tay, I would &s;oon put you out of livery.&mdash;I made no an&s;wer.&mdash;He threw down his pen, with which he was writing a letter, on the floor, and went out.&mdash;Gimcrack won that day; and on Wedne&s;day, in the evening, Sir Charles Bunbury &s;old him for &s;ix hundred guineas.&mdash;The Duke and Duche&s;s of King&s;ton made their grand appearance there after marriage, after the Duke had had her in keeping twenty years.&mdash;My ma&s;ter would not have been &s;orry if the Colonel had gone without me; for, when the races were over, he went to
<PB N="156" REF="168">
Mr. Nightley's, and afterwards to Farming|wood's, a &s;eat of the Earl of Spencer's, both in Northampton&s;hire. At that time there were nine or ten gentlemen and noblemen. Now you will &s;ee how God orders things that are to be. Lady Spencer was taken ill; an expre&s;s was &s;ent to Farmingwood's, and arrived at &s;ix in the morning, when my Lord and the company were at breakfa&s;t, before going a hunting. Orders were given di|rectly for all the chai&s;es to be got ready with &s;peed. We arrived in London in the even|ing. I went to the Colonel. Well, John, you are ju&s;t come in time to &s;et off in the morning. I told my ma&s;ter at night that I was to go in the morning, as the &s;hip was to &s;ail next day. He had company at break|fa&s;t, and I could not get him to take the things off my hands. The Colonel &s;ent the Chairmen for me twice. At la&s;t the Colo|nel's &s;ervant came; &s;o I came away without my wages or board wages.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="169">
When I came to Li&s;le-&s;treet, the chai&s;e and four hor&s;es were at the door, and all the things ready to go, and my trunk in the pa&s;|&s;age. The Colonel coming down &s;tairs to go into the chai&s;e, on &s;eeing me, went into the parlour till I got my trunk on. At eleven o'clock, the Colonel and I went into the chai&s;e, and at night we arrived at Deal. We were put in a room with two beds. I brought the things into the room. Supper was brought up. The waiter &s;aid to the Colonel, Your &s;ervant mu&s;t &s;leep in this room, Sir, for there is no other bed. He &s;aid, Very well. As it is late, waiter, bring &s;ome ale, and a bottle of wine, and you need not wait. So I eat my &s;upper in the &s;ame room; and in the morning Captain Smith made a &s;ignal for all the pa&s;&s;engers to come on board the Lord Camden, in the Downs; and that day we dined in the &s;hip, on our way to Port&s;mouth. After &s;taying two days at Port&s;mouth, and the &s;hip had got her di&s;patches
<PB N="158" REF="170">
from the India Hou&s;e, Captain Smith of the Lord Camden, and Captain Savage of the Duke of Cumberland, &s;et &s;ail together; as Captain Smith was the older captain, he took the name of Commodore; and the other &s;hips had their &s;ignals from the Lord Camden.</P>
<P>After we were out in the Channel there aro&s;e &s;uch a &s;torm, that we thought we &s;hould have been all lo&s;t together: and we put about, glad to get into Port&s;mouth again, with our lives; and there we remained ten days. The gentlemen were at the Fountain tavern all the time; we had nothing to do but walk about the country; at la&s;t the wind came about, and we made &s;ail on the tenth of April, 1769; we went on very well, and the &s;hips in &s;ight of each other almo&s;t every day.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="171">
The fir&s;t place we &s;topt at was Madeira. It was a fine place; but we &s;topped there but one day to take in wines, and &s;et &s;ail again. The Pur&s;er died on the pa&s;&s;age. Sometimes one died, and the burying was always before breakfa&s;t. At other times, a man or boy would fall over-board, and bury him&s;elf. A Lieutenant, going out pa&s;&s;enger to India, wanted to do the &s;ame; but was caught hold of by the legs, and &s;topped from that ra&s;h action, and taken care of. Something troubled his mind.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age is a plea&s;ant life for tho&s;e that have not much to do: to &s;ee the men catch|ing the fi&s;h and birds with a hook and bait; another &s;triking the fi&s;h with a gauge, an|other time drawing in a long &s;hark; and whoever brings in a fine dolphin to the Captain, receives a couple of bottles of li|quor. We had a calm &s;ometimes for a week, and could not get on two leagues;
<PB N="160" REF="172">
then a wind would &s;pring up and blow the one &s;hip on, and not come near the other for an hour or two.</P>
<P>The Colonel, on his pa&s;&s;age, was writing the hi&s;tory of Indo&s;tan; and Mr. Wood, a Cadet, whom the Colonel took a liking to on the pa&s;&s;age, he made him copy off what he wrote; and he gave me the rules of the army to write from, in order to keep my hand in u&s;e; &s;o we three wrote in the Colo|nel's cabin; and when we were dry, I made grog out of his ca&s;e; and when we were tired we went to walk on deck; there was &s;omething always to be &s;een there: &s;ome of the men frighting or drawing a fi&s;h out of the water; the porpoi&s;es or dolphins play|ing; or the &s;maller flying-fi&s;h flying over the waves from the larger ones. In the evening, all that could &s;ing a &s;ong &s;at down on the gang-way and &s;ung; and the gentle|men walked about and heard us; and, in
<PB N="161" REF="173">
fine weather, the gentlemen vi&s;ited from one &s;hip to another in their turn. It was a plea|&s;ant &s;ight to &s;ee the Commodore's boat let down along &s;ide, and the gentlemen going to dine out at &s;ea; and, when they came back, the Commodore would &s;ail about the &s;hip like people walking in a garden; and we all looking out over the &s;hip to &s;ee the gentlemen, more than a thou&s;and miles from land. The Commodore called for the great iron pot they had for the purpo&s;e, and bound a rope to the two ears of it, and let it down twenty fathoms; and then held the rope fa&s;t, to &s;ee which way the boat went, back, or on our way where we were bound. The tide would carry us backward or for|ward, &s;ometimes &s;ix miles, frequently with|out wind. When we were going to cro&s;s the line, ju&s;t under the &s;un, every one that had not been there before, was to pay half a crown towards grog, for the &s;hip's men to drink; but there were three who would not
<PB N="162" REF="174">
pay: a Scotchman, a Wel&s;hman, and a Por|tugue&s;e &s;oldier. It is the cu&s;tom to let tho&s;e who refu&s;e to pay, down from the yard-arm, by a rope round their middle, four or five fathoms in the &s;ea, three times each, one after the other. It was pa&s;time to the &s;hip's company. Each of the three got two bot|tles of liquor from the gentlemen, to make merry.</P>
<P>We made the Brazils, in South America; but Commodore Smith would not go on &s;hore. The wind being foul, run us to forty degrees &s;outh latitude; and then we were obliged to run back to the Cape of Good Hope to get &s;ounding. After our departure we had a fre&s;h gale from the Cape for Joanna; but a &s;torm aro&s;e, which made us loo&s;e the Duke of Cumberland for a fortnight. We &s;ailed down between Africa to Madaga&s;car, eight hundred miles. By this time a great many of the men had got the &s;curvy by living on &s;alt
<PB N="163" REF="175">
provi&s;ions; and two duels were to be fought at Joanna by the Cadets.</P>
<P>We lo&s;t &s;ight of Madaga&s;car, and got &s;ight of Joanna, (a fine i&s;land, and a beautiful view,) in the month of Augu&s;t; every thing green, the very hills and mountains covered with &s;hrubs. We were greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, when we came near the town and anchoring-place of Joanna, to &s;ee the Duke of Cumberland &s;afe at anchor. We came to, and dropped anchor; and the &s;hips &s;aluted each other with their guns, which made the hills re|&s;ound.</P>
<P>The town &s;tands on a level piece of ground, &s;urrounded by many &s;orts of trees, in parti|cular cocoa-nuts, with high mountains; and a large brook on each &s;ide of the town. The black people came on board from their canoes, in dozens, to &s;ell and buy things The boats were &s;ent on &s;hore for milk, fine
<PB N="164" REF="176">
water and fowl; and the Prince &s;ent word that he would come in the morning. That night we had plenty of milk and cocoa. The fir&s;t thing that was done in the morning, was, to &s;end the men on &s;hore that had the &s;cur|vy, to put them into the earth up to the neck, and to remain there one day; which is the mo&s;t &s;peedy cure in a hot country. Their &s;kin will be as black as a coal, when put in; and, in two days, they were as well as ever.</P>
<P>At breakfa&s;t the Prince came on board to take orders; he was the King's &s;on-in-law, a very hand&s;ome man, in the Mahometan dre&s;s; he did bu&s;ine&s;s for the king and him|&s;elf. He was over the King's cattle; he was glad to &s;ee the Commodore; he had known him many years. He came into the cuddy, with the gentlemen, to breakfa&s;t; he ate bread and butter, with a little &s;ugar over it. The Steward made him &s;herbet to drink; he took orders for bullocks, fowls, goats, and
<PB N="165" REF="177">
vegetables. There are no &s;heep, hor&s;es, nor ducks on the i&s;land, although it is thirty miles long. Each &s;hip had a marquee pitched on &s;hore for the Commanders to dine in with their company. Next day the Prince came on board; the Colonel took him to his cabbin, and &s;hewed him books in the Moori&s;h language, mo&s;t richly bound in London, and pictures of all the gods in the Ea&s;t. The Prince was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee &s;uch things come from England. He &s;poke the Moori&s;h language to the Prince, and made him a pre&s;ent of &s;ome fine books of his own religion. The Colonel a&s;ked him how many wives he had? He &s;aid, four; and that one of them was the King's daughter. The &s;ervant that attended the Prince wore a &s;word by his &s;ide. The Prince invited the Colonel to come and &s;ee him next day at the hou&s;e where he did bu&s;ine&s;s, not where his family lived. He promi&s;ed he would next day, after he was dre&s;&s;ed, and Mr. Wood
<PB N="166" REF="178">
with him. He &s;aid, John, dre&s;s your&s;elf, and come a&s;hore with me, and take a bottle of rum in your hand. We went, and walked all round the town: at la&s;t the Prince met him, and took him home; where we all went. The Prince made lemonade, and I put rum to it, which made good punch; we were all in the &s;ame company, but I next the door. The Colonel was a good man, and had the &s;pirit of an emperor. The Prince's three &s;ons came to pay their re|&s;pects to the Colonel; fine young boys; he &s;poke to them in Moori&s;h; at la&s;t the Prince and his &s;ons went away; and &s;oon after the Prince &s;ent a fine di&s;h of chickens, curried and boiled; rice broth in wooden platters; and three wooden &s;poons and wooden plates; we ate heartily, for it was very good: and the Colonel was very merry. He knew their ways; but, to Mr. Wood and me, it &s;eemed &s;trange to &s;ee &s;uch things. The &s;lave-boy &s;tood and wondered at us. When we were
<PB N="167" REF="179">
done, he carried every thing away in a mo|ment. There was neither table nor chair, but fitting on a mat, &s;uch as you kneel on at churches in England or lean your elbow on. The Princes came in &s;oon, and made more &s;herbet, and I put more rum to complete it. He made a little for him&s;elf; for, on account of their religion, they can|not eat nor drink with a Chri&s;tian. The Prince went out; and, &s;oon after, came two fine black girls, the Princes &s;laves, dre&s;&s;ed in the Moori&s;h manner; they had rings on their fingers, ears, and toes, and bangles on their arms; their brea&s;ts were covered with various ornaments; a large ring of &s;ilver hung loo&s;e round the &s;mall of the leg; it was very light and hollow. They had nei|ther &s;hift nor &s;tockings; but a thin &s;ilk gauze for a petticoat, and another, the re|ver&s;e, from the wai&s;t upwards, fa&s;tened on the left &s;houlder, like the dre&s;s of a Scotch Highlander. The petticoat is full, and

comes down as far as the ring on their leg; the fine&s;t dre&s;&s;ed one entered fir&s;t; put her two hands to her forehead, then to her brea&s;ts, and with her two hands touched the Colonel's foot; this is called a grand &s;alam; in like manner the other paid her compli|ments to Mr. Wood.</P>
<P>After the common compliments were over, I was going. My Ma&s;ter &s;aid, John if I don't come on board to-night I &s;hall in the morning. I walked along the &s;hore, and went out with the la&s;t boat, about half a mile by &s;ea to the &s;hip. At the bottom of the &s;ea, round Joanna, the coral grows up like &s;hort &s;pikes, that help the children in England to cut their teeth. The Prince &s;ent the books to the King's hou&s;e. In two days he and his &s;on came on board the two &s;hips, with their attendants, and a band of mu&s;ic like two or three old bag-pipes, &s;uch as they take through the &s;treets of London with the
<PB N="169" REF="181">
dancing bears. The King was a &s;tout old man, his own &s;on a genteel Prince about thirty. The mu&s;ic &s;topped in the boat along-&s;ide. The King and Prince were entertained with bi&s;cuit, butter, &s;ugar, and &s;herbet. They went to &s;ee the Colonel's books, with which they were much delighted. The Colonel made the King a pre&s;ent of the Alcoran, the Bible of the Mahometans, in their own lan|guage, richly bound in London, worth four hundred rupees. The King invited the Co|lonel to his country-hou&s;e, about ten miles di&s;tant. He promi&s;ed to come next day. The Colonel invited Mr. Mathi&s;on, the &s;u|percargo, from on board the Duke of Cum|berland, to accompany him. He was ready by nine o'clock, went on &s;hore and met the Prince, who accompanied us. We were in company, the Colonel, Mr. Mathi&s;on, the Prince and I, and the Prince's &s;ervant, and the Colonel's black fellow, whom he had to attend him while in Joanna, and to carry
<PB N="170" REF="182">
the umbrella, made of paper, over his head. I had two bottles of rum with me. We walked up the mountains along the foot-way through the fine&s;t &s;hrubberies. We were two miles higher than the &s;urface of the &s;ea. Many times we looked back. The &s;hips looked like &s;mall boats on the river Thames; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the beauty of the &s;cene, or the fine &s;mell of the trees, fruit and flowers; there is not a palanquin, or any carriage, on the whole i&s;land. The King walks wherever he goes, and his people have word about with him. The King's town lies in a valley, where no white man had been in the remembrance of any per&s;on living; and had it not been for the Alcoran nor we neither. The hou&s;es were no more than huts, except a few higher ones for the King, and the Prince that had the King's daughter, his wife, here: and another where we came from, and where he has four wives at different places.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="183">
It would have alarmed the inhabitants to &s;ee white people, had it not been known that the Colonel gave the King a pre&s;ent of the Alcoran. We arrived at the King's hou&s;e for bu&s;ine&s;s. No per&s;on can go to the fa|mily hou&s;es. The King and Prince of Jo|anna received the company kindly. There was plenty of fruit and lemonade, and I added rum; for we wanted refre&s;hment after walk|ing ten miles over the mountains. There was a bench like a taylor's work-board, co|vered with a Scotch carpet, which the King had got in exchange of trade, and which did well for &s;itting on. Governor Ru&s;tan came in: he had the command of the town when the &s;hips lay at anchor. He made a grand &s;alam, and they all &s;poke the Moori&s;h lan|guage; his &s;on had the Colonel's linen to wa&s;h. The capital mens' &s;ons at Joanna, when any &s;hips arrive, come on board, get the pa&s;&s;enger's linen to wa&s;h, which is done by their &s;laves; they will &s;hew you a
<PB N="172" REF="184">
recommendation from one of the la&s;t &s;hip's company. They charged a dollar for &s;ixty pieces, whether large or &s;mall. In like manner you give a character from your hand, which they &s;hew to the next &s;hip's com|pany. They make the linen as white as &s;now. The King and the Princes ta&s;ted the rum, and then put a little in their &s;herbet. They went away home, and &s;ent a fine currie, both of fi&s;h and chickens, and fine rice boiled. The Colonel's &s;ervant waited; and I had as much as I could eat, and there was punch enough. It was the be&s;t dinner I ever ate. After dinner the Prince and King of Joanna came and &s;at a-while with the Co|lonel, and conver&s;ed; they &s;poke Engli&s;h very well; and &s;aid, that Engli&s;hmen and Joanna men were ju&s;t like, brothers. As we had more punch, the Colonel prevailed on the King to drink out of his own cup; the King made each of the two gentlemen a pre&s;ent of a turban of fine mu&s;lin, richly
<PB N="173" REF="185">
mixed with gold and &s;ilver; and I had one of an inferior &s;ort; and two young bullocks, and two milch goats, were ordered for the Colonel from Joanna. Next morning the Colonel thanked the King of Joanna for his politene&s;s and attention. After conver&s;ing they both withdrew; in half an hour two fine girls came in with a veil over their heads and bodies. When they came in, that was thrown off. They were very richly dre&s;&s;ed. I declare they were like a diamond; they made my hair &s;tand an end to &s;ee them. I went directly out along with the black men: when I came home I lay down in a little appartment. The girls went off at five in the morning: I came in at &s;ix, and got &s;ome toddy from the cocoa-nutters, which we mixed with rum and fruit, and made a breakfa&s;t about eight. The Prince came to accompany the Colonel. After drinking &s;ome toddy, with rum, we &s;et off, dre&s;&s;ed in our turbans; the black man carried the
<PB N="174" REF="186">
gentlemen's hats, and I carried my own. Every per&s;on looked at us as we went along, with the two bullocks and two &s;he-goats behind us. I never enjoyed more happine&s;s in my life than at this time, the walk was &s;o plea&s;ant, and every thing agreeable. We walked along where no white man living had been but our&s;elves. All the people were very de&s;irous to &s;ee us. As we walked along, the Colonel made a remark on our turbans; the Colonel's was rich blue and gold, Mr. Mathi&s;on's red, rich with &s;ilver; and my turban green, with gold at the ends; ju&s;t the colour of the three orders in Great Bri|tain, the garter, the bath, and the thi&s;tle. It was a little laughable, as the King gave tho&s;e three colours by chance. The gentle|men conver&s;ed as they walked along; they a&s;ked the Prince if the King was rich; he an&s;wered that the King had ten thou&s;and dollars in ready money: he told how plea|&s;ant it was in the &s;outh part of the i&s;land;
<PB N="175" REF="187">
and that there he had one of his wives, and that in Raham I&s;land he had another. This lay on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Joanna, where he had cattle.</P>
<P>We arrived at Joanna town at twelve o'clock; the Colonel &s;ent one bullock and the two milch goats as a pre&s;ent to Commo|dore Smith, and the other bullock to Captain Savage of the Duke of Cumberland. As the boat was not ready to carry the two gentle|men on board the Lord Camden to dine, they walked about, and, to put off time, went into the Mo&s;que. We all put off our &s;hoes, which is the cu&s;tom. The two gentlemen were in &s;carlet, which looked very well with the turbans. On the pa&s;&s;age the Colonel gave me an old &s;carlet coat. I cut off the &s;kirts and made it a &s;hort coat, which with the turban, looked better than theirs, more like that of a &s;eapoy officer. The people came and admired us much at &s;eeing us go into the
<PB N="176" REF="188">
Mo&s;que. We got on board to dinner. As I &s;poke &s;o much about the currie, twelve of us made a party to dine on &s;hore next day. As the King's &s;ilver-&s;mith was on board, we a&s;ked him to make &s;ome currie, to which he agreed. The Commodore's cook, and &s;er|vant, &s;hip carpenter, &s;hip &s;teward, the boat|&s;wain, and &s;ome mid&s;hipmen, were in our party. We all walked a great deal, and then had an excellent dinner of currie and rice.</P>
<P>Next day the Colonel and Mr. Mathi&s;on went up the valley, to &s;ee the grand ca&s;cade which falls over the rock, a quarter of a mile perpendicular height, one of the fine&s;t in the world. Before nine they went on &s;hore, as they wanted to catch a di&s;h of trout. As both the Commanders were to dine on &s;hore that day, in their marquees under the cocoa|nut trees, the men were all got well with good fre&s;h provi&s;ions. They had got wood and water on board, and all was ready for
<PB N="177" REF="189">
&s;ailing, only waiting for a fair wind. I went to the Commanders when they were angling under the ca&s;cade, where they had great &s;uc|ce&s;s, having caught a large di&s;h of trout for their me&s;s. I carried brandy, and the gen|tlemen made a boy climb up the trees to throw down &s;ome cocoa nuts. They mixed brandy with the cocoa nut milk and drank it. They arrived at the dining-place at one o'clock with their fi&s;h. The two marquees were facing one another; and while they were at dinner the gentlemen drank to one another. There were two French horns be|tween the marquees, playing at dinner, and the evening was &s;pent with plea&s;ure. The Prince came after dinner and &s;at a-while, and the black people came and danced to the gentlemen. It was a dance with cudgel|playing, very merry.</P>
<P>Next day the Colonel was to dine on board the Duke of Cumberland, with Captain Sa|vage
<PB N="178" REF="190">
and Mr. Mathi&s;on: they both went to angle as before, and I followed them with li|quor. At one o'clock they were on board at dinner; they told of their &s;port, and how John always brought them a Scotch dinner, all drinking but no eating. I dined with the Captain's &s;ervant. I told them of our jour|ney up to the King's town. The wind came round to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and Commodore Smith made a &s;ignal for &s;ailing. The com|pany broke up; the Colonel went into the boat, and I after him. In half an hour we were under &s;ail, with a fine wind.</P>
<P>Next day, when we were &s;ailing with a bri&s;k wind and a rough &s;ea, the Commodore called me after breakfa&s;t, to cut his hair and put it in order to go on &s;hore at Bombay. At that in&s;tant a Scotch boy fell over-board. The alarm was given. The Commodore called <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Down with the &s;ails, throw the hencoop over-board."</Q> All hands were
<PB N="179" REF="191">
looking over. He was a boy about &s;ixteen; and as he was a fine &s;wimmer, he put off his clothes, and got on the hencoop, where he &s;at and held fa&s;t till the &s;hip was &s;topped and a boat let down. He was then a mile be|hind: the men went for him in the boat, took him in, fixed a rope to the hencoop, and brought him on board. He lo&s;t his clothes, but he had enough given him by the gentle|men. We went on with a fair wind, and when we were on the coa&s;t of Malabar, one morning Captain Savage &s;ent the Commo|dore twelve hot rolls for breakfa&s;t, and a fine &s;allad for dinner. The &s;allad grew in two little gardens on the hind corners on the poop. As we were &s;ailing down the coa&s;t of Malabar, we &s;aw a fight at &s;ea between the fleets of Hyder Ally and the Marrattas. We &s;aw the firing very well for two hours. Hy|der Ally's fleet &s;truck to the Marrattas. Our two &s;hips at this time were within three miles of each other. We arrived at Bom|bay
<PB N="180" REF="192">
the middle of September, after all the rains were over.</P>
<P>General Pimble received the Colonel at the Marine Hou&s;e, and took him to his country hou&s;e at Ma&s;tegan, a mile from Bombay Town, and clo&s;e to Me&s;&s;igan Vil|lage. The hou&s;e &s;tood on a hill almo&s;t &s;ur|rounded by &s;ea. General Pimble was then Commander in Chief at Bombay. The Colonel &s;ent a Sepoy for me and the bag|gage, and to &s;hew me the way to the Com|mander in Chief's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Next day the Colonel went to Porrelle, in the country, to wait on Governor Hodges, and the day following he took the command of all the Sepoys on the Bombay e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. There were four battalions, which amounted to nine thou&s;and men. We were three weeks at General Pimble's, which was of &s;ervice to me to learn the ways of the
<PB N="181" REF="193">
place. The General kept a great deal of company, and had a great number of &s;er|vants. I waited every day at table. It is an old &s;aying and a true one, go where you will, whatever place, you will find an acquaint|ance &s;ooner or later by chance. The Gene|ral's valet was a German, Adam la Plue.&mdash;When I was at the German Spa with Mr. Crauford, he was footman to Lady Spencer, but on &s;ome account he was obliged to re|treat to India as a &s;oldier. He put him&s;elf down as a hair-dre&s;&s;er, and the General took him out of the ranks. He and I &s;lept and eat together. Now I was out of livery, and he in livery. One morning the Colonel &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"John, bring my clothes, and dre&s;s me for the ball: I dine with the General in town at his own hou&s;e, and we &s;hall dre&s;s after dinner."</Q> As I was carrying my bundle, and Adam pa&s;&s;ing me on hor&s;eback, I a&s;ked the favour of him to carry it before him, for it was very hot; but he would not. I wait|ed
<PB N="182" REF="194">
dinner, and in the evening the two gentle|men dre&s;&s;ed in one room.</P>
<P>I went that night to &s;ee their manner at the ball, for the &s;ervants in India are excel|lent and &s;ober. When the Colonel came home, he &s;aid, John, my hair &s;tands up as well as when I went out, and all the other gentlemen's hair is down. I &s;aid, Sir, the people here don't know how to u&s;e the po|made; for I had contrived to &s;tiffen the po|matum with waxen candles. He an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"If you like, you may get a great deal of mo|ney here by cutting gentlemen's hair; and, John, as I have got the command of the Se|poys, I &s;hall give a ball to the gentlemen and ladies at the Marine Hou&s;e next week, and I &s;hall de&s;ire the favour of Buckthergee, the General's &s;teward, to buy in all the things for &s;upper, as you are a &s;tranger. When it comes in you mu&s;t order the &s;upper, and the General's cooks will make it ready; and I
<PB N="183" REF="195">
have hired Wanella, a Per&s;ian &s;ervant to a&s;|&s;i&s;t you."</Q> Very well, Sir, I replied, I &s;hall do my endeavour to &s;et every thing out to the be&s;t purpo&s;e. I went and looked at the ta|ble room, and then a&s;ked Buckthergee, who was a Mahometan, and had a &s;ervant of his own, what things he could &s;end me. He gave me an idea of different things. I beg|ged of him to &s;end four turkeys, two cocks, and two hens; the two cocks roa&s;ted, &s;et round with &s;au&s;ages, and two hens boiled, with oy&s;ter-&s;auce. I made out a bill of fare for &s;upper, of fifty things, on a long piece of paper, after the manner of Europe. I made a circle round a crown, a half crown, a &s;hilling, and round a farthing. I wrote the name of every di&s;h as it was to &s;tand on the table, and I gave it to Silve&s;ter the head cook, to put up in his cook-room. I &s;et the table and the &s;ide-tables.&mdash;I had two &s;ilver epargnes full of &s;weetmeats, and three cry&s;tal &s;tands with &s;yllabubs and jellies, in a row, on the middle of the table, with three rows of
<PB N="184" REF="196">
plates, with fruits and de&s;erts from top to bottom. I was determined to exert my&s;elf. On the afternoon of the ball I dre&s;&s;ed my|&s;elf in a green &s;ilk wai&s;tcoat, double brea&s;ted, with &s;leeves mounted with gold, like a jacket. When the cook a&s;ked a que&s;tion, he came to me to read the bill, and an excellent &s;upper he did dre&s;s. The General's butler and I made negus and punch, and &s;erved out the wines. All the black men &s;eemed very well plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t in any thing they were de&s;ired to do, and &s;eemed &s;urprized to &s;ee an Eng|li&s;hman have the command. As &s;ervants, there were only two Europeans in the I&s;land, Adam Le Plue with the General, (he did nothing but take care of his ma&s;ter's clothes and dre&s;s his hair,) and another with Colonel Gordon from Li&s;bon, (he dre&s;&s;ed his ma&s;ter, and took care of the liquors, but to provide for a table he knew nothing), Colonel Keat|ing, Colonel Egerton, Mr. Ram&s;ay, and Mr. Horn&s;by's butlers came. They were Moors.
<PB N="185" REF="197">
The General's butler was an A&s;iatic Roman Catholic. He de&s;ired me to a&s;k them. I went and de&s;ired them to a&s;&s;i&s;t me the night, as I was a &s;tranger, and come to remain among&s;t them. They made a &s;alam, and &s;aid they were happy to be at my &s;ervice the whole night; &s;o I gave them &s;ome tea and cakes, but they could not eat with me, or drink liquor.</P>
<P>When the table was trimmed, and all rea|dy, before &s;upper, the black men admired it, and &s;aid, Your table looks like a diamond, Steward. I lo&s;t the name of Macdonald that night, and got the name of Steward; for a head &s;ervant in India is always called Steward. The company a&s;&s;embled, the dancing went on; and when my fellow|&s;ervant, Wanilla, the Per&s;ian, was taking round &s;ome negus to the ladies, he heard Mi&s;s De la Guarde a&s;k the General, what gentleman that was in the green and gold?
<PB N="186" REF="198">
Madam, that is John Macdonald, Colonel Dow's &s;ervant. The broad gold lace, though tarni&s;hed by day, &s;hone among &s;o many lights. At twelve the &s;upper was ready, and carried up by the &s;ervants that came to wait on their ma&s;ters. The upper &s;ervants I men|tioned before put the &s;upper on the table. I held the bill of the &s;upper in my hand, to &s;hew them to put every thing in its place. Every thing was done at a word; and they were more happy to be directed by me than by one of their own people. The company &s;at down, and I put the bill before the Co|lonel. The gentlemen &s;aid, they never &s;aw &s;uch a &s;upper in Bombay, nor things better conducted; and the gentlemen were well plea&s;ed that the black &s;ervants &s;aw a white man could order a &s;upper as well as either of them, or better. When &s;upper was over, the bill of fare was handed about from one lady to another, and they &s;aid, Certainly this Engli&s;hman is a very good &s;ervant. The
<PB N="187" REF="199">
company broke up at four in the morning. When I was putting the Colonel to-bed, he &s;aid, John, I'll be damned but you conducted your&s;elf va&s;tly well at this ball, and with judgment; and the gentlemen give you a great character, and they &s;ay you have the be&s;t method of any with the black men. I an&s;wered, Sir, I am very glad I have done right, and given &s;atisfaction. After this I was very much re&s;pected by the black men. The Colonel gave one thou&s;and rupees for a &s;addle-hor&s;e, and bought two hor&s;es for his chariot, all &s;tallions; he hired a fir&s;t and &s;e|cond coachman, and bought two &s;laves, one for the kitchen, and the other to help Wa|nilla and me. As the Colonel had taken a hou&s;e, he went to hou&s;ekeeping. He got Captain Savage's &s;econd cook, a black man, an American. The Colonel a&s;ked the fa|vour of Mr. Mathi&s;on, the &s;upercargo of the Duke of Cumberland, to be in the hou&s;e with him as a companion, till the &s;hip was
<PB N="188" REF="200">
to &s;ail for Macoa, which was about three months. The &s;ervant Mr. Mathi&s;on had from England got to be a writer, therefore I dre&s;&s;ed him. The Colonel and Mr. Ma|thi&s;on got four coollies each, to carry their palankin. The Colonel had a ma&s;&s;all to car|ry the umbrella by day, and the flambeau by night; and a pair to run before the chariot or palankin, with &s;words drawn in their hands; &s;o this was our family, without a maid-&s;ervant.</P>
<P>As my ma&s;ter made his fortune in Ben|gal, and was a &s;ingle man, he did not mind money; therefore he kept the be&s;t hou&s;e in Bombay. The principal people dined with one another in their turn. The cu&s;tom is, where they dine they &s;up; and there was no|thing to provide at home. As the country is very hot, my ma&s;ter told me to buy every thing that was wanting in the hou&s;e. He got a li&s;t of the prices of every thing for the
<PB N="189" REF="201">
hou&s;e, and for the u&s;e of the hor&s;es, from Buckthergee the &s;teward. I paid every &s;er|vant their wages the fir&s;t day of the month always; if any did not fill their place, I turned him away, and hired another in his place, without acquainting the Colonel. Our hou&s;e was called the fir&s;t in Bombay for ho&s;pitality. The Colonel invited the Commander in Chief and his Lady, and the fir&s;t gentlemen and ladies in town, to dinner and &s;upper. The dinner was admired much, and the ladies &s;aid, It is very odd we cannot have &s;uch a dinner at our own hou&s;es; yet there is not one woman in this hou&s;e! And the General &s;aid after dinner, Good God, how handy this young man is turned out! When I was putting the Colonel to bed, he told me &s;o, and gave me great applau&s;e; and next day he gave me three &s;uits of clothes, trimmed with gold.</P>
<P>In December Commodore Sir John Lind|&s;ay arrived at Bombay, with the King's &s;hips
<PB N="190" REF="202">
of war under his command. He &s;ent his &s;teward, and the &s;tewards of the captains under his command, to know the price of things in the i&s;land, the &s;ame as I learned from Buckthergee.&mdash;According to cu&s;tom, at Chri&s;tmas, the Governor gave a dinner to all the gentlemen in the i&s;land, about two hundred and fifty, and the &s;ame on the fir&s;t day of the new year, and all we Engli&s;h &s;er|vants waited, for there was a great many in Sir John Lind&s;ay's fleet. We all dined to|gether, and each had two bottles of wine al|lowed him. The time of the year that is called winter in Europe, was &s;pent in a jovial manner, in vi&s;iting, balls, and entertainments. At this time an evil thought came into the mind of General Pimble, I believe for him|&s;elf as well as for others. He wanted all the officers to wear boots on duty. It was again&s;t the ca&s;t or religion of the Gentoo officers to eat beef, or wear their &s;kins, even calves or &s;heep &s;kins. Some of the principal officers waited on the General, to tell him
<PB N="191" REF="203">
they could not po&s;&s;ibly comply with his or|der to wear boots, that were made of the &s;kins of tho&s;e creatures, which was entirely again&s;t their ca&s;t or religion; if they did, they would lo&s;e their ca&s;t, and be deprived of the company of their relations. The Ge|neral in&s;i&s;ted that they &s;hould wear the boots, or give up their commi&s;&s;ions. They got three days to con&s;ult with their friends, and return an an&s;wer. They put up prayers to God, and hoped that God of his goodne&s;s would not impute the &s;in to them nor their children, but to the per&s;on who was the cau&s;e of their wearing boots of &s;kins of tho&s;e bea&s;ts, which was entirely again&s;t their reli|gion. The prayers were put up in the pa|godas at Bombay. They told him, they had determined to wear the boots, according to his de&s;ire. <Q REND="inline">"Since, &s;aid they, God has &s;ent you from Europe to give us di&s;turbance con|cerning our religious principles, and to de|prive us of our friends company, and the be|nefits
<PB N="192" REF="204">
of our religion, we will &s;ubmit to God and your Excellency."</Q> So they took leave and went home. In three weeks the Gene|ral was &s;mitten with the drop&s;y, and never recovered. About this time my ma&s;ter gave a dinner to Sir John Lind&s;ay and his officers. The Colonel, Sir John Lind&s;ay, Andrew Ram&s;ay, E&s;q. and Mr. Patter&s;on, Secretary to Commodore Lind&s;ay, made an appoint|ment to go to the hot-wells at Dillanagoga, in the Marrattas country inland, over again&s;t Bombay. They were to go in the month of April. Commodore Wat&s;on and other gen|tlemen were to go in another party to the &s;ame place. The General was getting very ill, his di&s;order growing wor&s;e every week. The advice of his phy&s;icians, Tennant, Bond, and Richard&s;on, was, to go to Bencoot, one of our &s;ettlements, a fine airy &s;ituation as any in India. People are &s;ent there ju&s;t as gentlemen are &s;ent from England to Li&s;bon, or the South of France, for the benefit of
<PB N="193" REF="205">
of their health. The General went to Ben|coot; and Colonel Gordon was left in com|mand, as being the &s;enior officer. Commo|dore Wat&s;on, his family, and party, were gone to Dillinagogue. Commodore Wat&s;on be|longed to the Honourable Ea&s;t-India Com|pany. The Colonel and his party were pre|paring; and we &s;et off in a large boat, with &s;ails, acro&s;s the &s;ea, and entered the great river of Tannah, with a ve&s;&s;el following us with all the nece&s;&s;aries for an empty hou&s;e, &s;ervants, two havaldars, or Sepoy &s;erjeants, twelve Sepoys, with their arms, four palan|kins, with eight men for each, four &s;addle|hor&s;es, with their keepers. We had plenty of provi&s;ions with us for two days in the boats. I was greatly delighted, and thought it was a plea&s;ant thing to live under the Ea&s;t-India Company.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed Sal&s;ette, Carranjaw, and the beautiful country, and the banks of the river.
<PB N="194" REF="206">
The people came in numbers to &s;ee us. The country people brought us &s;ome of them milk, others fruit. Before we came oppo&s;ite the city and fortification of Tannah, which is near the banks of the river, the Colonel &s;ent his &s;ervant Ru&s;tan on &s;hore, with a me&s;&s;age to the Governor, Rummagee Punt, for a pa&s;&s;port. We waited three hours for it. We could not &s;tir, nor go near the fort; if we had, we &s;hould have been fired at. The gentlemen &s;ent their re&s;pects, and that they would do them&s;elves the honour to wait on his Excellency on their return. The pa&s;&s;port came when they were at dinner. We &s;et &s;ail, and pa&s;&s;ed the towers and walls of the fort in the afternoon. Thou&s;ands of people were looking at us and the Sepoys over the walls. Our Sepoys had new cloaths, and all red and blue turbans. The two haval|dars were like two officers, two likely young men, Mahometans. In the evening, when the tide turned, we &s;topped. The gentlemen
<PB N="195" REF="207">
drank punch, and &s;ung till they fell a&s;leep in the cabin. In the day, two of Mr. Ram&s;ay's &s;ervants u&s;ed the fir&s;t and &s;econd French-horns, which were very plea&s;ant on the river. I was the only white &s;ervant there. My fellow-&s;ervant, Ru&s;tan, told me he never heard of a white &s;ervant there be|fore. Sir John Lind&s;ay's valet, a German, was left &s;ick at Bombay. His name was Longchamps, afterwards a great man at Newmarket.</P>
<P>In the evening we landed at the Bundy, a town, from whence we were to go by land to the hot-wells. We were all night at a rich Moorman's hou&s;e, who was often at Bombay on bu&s;ine&s;s. He let Mr. Ram&s;ay have an apartment in his hou&s;e, for him&s;elf and the gentlemen. At the Bundy, a plea|&s;ant town, we left the river to go by land. The Moorman, at who&s;e hou&s;e we were, had a great many wives: and one Sally Percival,
<PB N="196" REF="208">
a black girl, who had gone along with us, had an opportunity to go in where they were. She told them, the Engli&s;h gentlemen had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee them, and begged to let her undraw the curtain, on the in&s;ide the window. When the ma&s;ter, Afdalla, was gone out a little, they went and had a &s;ight, by looking through a window. They did not &s;tay a minute, for fear of his return. One gentleman &s;aid, They are pretty: ano|ther &s;aid, They are richly dre&s;&s;ed. I wi&s;h we had them here, &s;aid another. This Sally Percival, whom I have mentioned, lived with a gentleman who had gone home to Europe. He gave her her freedom, and a great deal of money. Afterwards &s;he lived with Dr. Per|cival, by whom &s;he had a &s;on: but the Doctor died, and left a great deal of money to Sally and the little boy. By this time &s;he was worth between four and five thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. She had a town and country hou&s;e in the i&s;land of Bombay. Dr. Tennant and Mr. Ram&s;ay were her tru&s;tees.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="209">
In the morning, after the gentlemen were dre&s;&s;ed, I and Ru&s;tan and Bigo, two Per&s;ian men belonging to Sir John Lind&s;ay, &s;et out on hor&s;eback up a valley about fifteen miles long. The gentlemen were to follow in their palankeens, and Sally Percival along with them. At the top of the valley were the hot wells, &s;urrounded by the mountains. The valley was very plea&s;ant, about two miles broad, with a &s;mall &s;erpentine river on our right hand. As we rode along we &s;aw a large fort on the top of the hill, that contained a thou&s;and men; and there was another on our left hand, on the top of a very high mountain, near Dillinagogue. When we came to Dahoo, a village half way to the Wells, we &s;topped to have &s;ome milk and cocoa-nuts. My hor&s;e picked up a &s;tone in his &s;hoe. I knocked it out with another &s;tone, which made my hands dirty. I went to wa&s;h them in the puddle that lay near the well of the village. At that time a farmer's
<PB N="198" REF="210">
daughter came for water, a pretty girl, a Gentoo. She had her &s;lave girl with her, to carry the water home. She was &s;orry to &s;ee me wa&s;hing my hands in the dirty water; therefore &s;he poured water on my hands out of the pitcher. I wa&s;hed my hands, and dried them with my handkerchief. Then I made her a low &s;alam, and took hold of her hand. A freeman's daughter at Bombay would not have done &s;o for any money, they are kept at &s;o great a di&s;tance from the Eng|li&s;h. When &s;he went away, I told Ru&s;tan &s;he was a fine girl. He &s;aid, She was very well plea&s;ed that you made her a grand &s;a|lam before her &s;lave girl. She thinks we are all your &s;ervants, by your having that fine gold-laced hat, and gold on your coat. Mo&s;t people of the village came to &s;ee us, whil&s;t we were drinking our milk. After we left this place, as we pur&s;ued our journey, there were &s;ome mares feeding. Our hor&s;es being &s;tallions, were like mad things after the
<PB N="199" REF="211">
mares. They ran after them, &s;o that we could not &s;top them, and began fighting with one another. We were therefore ob|liged to throw our&s;elves from off their backs. Ru&s;tan, Bigo, and I never were more happy in our lives than when we got &s;afe off their backs. When the three hor&s;es' keepers came up, who were a little way behind, they got hold of the hor&s;es with great diffi|culty. We got on hor&s;eback again, and ar|rived at Dillinagogue in the afternoon. A while after the gentlemen arrived. The hou&s;es were made and covered with branches of trees. The building of a hou&s;e would co&s;t eighteen half crowns. There was no rent to pay; but when the gentlemen went home, before the rain &s;hould come, which is about the end of May, the farmers take the hou&s;e for firewood. There is plenty of fi&s;h, fowl, mutton, wild boar, hares, and other provi|&s;ions cheap. The gentlemen drank the waters, dre&s;&s;ed, played at cards, and after dinner &s;lept
<PB N="200" REF="212">
an hour or two; then in the afternoon they rode out on hor&s;eback, and in the evening played at cards again.</P>
<P>After we had been here &s;ome time, the tiger came at night, and paid our hen hou&s;e a vi&s;it. As it was very ea&s;y to break open, he killed the fowls and took them away.&mdash;After this a Sepoy was &s;ent up the tree to &s;hoot him when he came, but he never killed one, as he commonly fell a&s;leep. Two weeks after we came here, a pattamar came with an expre&s;s of the death of General Pim|ble, at Bencoot, where he was buried. Next expre&s;s by a pattamar, brought an account that the &s;hip that brought the genelemen that attended the General, in their return to Bombay, with Adam La Plue, the Ge|neral's &s;ervant, and the baggage, were at|tacked by the Cooleys. On their return home, in the battle, the fire of the Cooleys got into the &s;hip's powder room, and blew
<PB N="201" REF="213">
the &s;hip up in the air, and all was lo&s;t; and that Sir John Lind&s;ay's head cook, went to bed at Bombay, well at night, and was found dead in the morning. The gentlemen were very &s;orry, for there were a great many of their friends blown up with the &s;hip.</P>
<P>In three weeks Commodore Wat&s;on and his party went home, round the hot wells. This was the plea&s;ante&s;t place I ever &s;aw: fine large old trees in abundance, and many rivulets running down from the mountains all round. When we walked at night, we had a &s;tick with a rattle on the end of it, to rattle as we went along to frighten the &s;er|pents away, for fear we &s;hould tread on them. I was very much delighted here with one thing: at Dillinagogue there was a tank, where the Gentoos bathe them&s;elves, and the women in particular. At the end of the tank is a piece of ri&s;ing ground, with a cro&s;s fixed twelve feet high, where a prie&s;t &s;its, mo&s;t
<PB N="202" REF="214">
days, naked as he was born. When the wo|men come to enter the bath, they make the prie&s;t a grand &s;alam. They have a &s;hift on when they enter the water. When a young girl, who has been betrothed for &s;ome years, is going home to her hu&s;band, (for they mar|ry very young, and go to their hu&s;band's hou&s;e from their father's at twelve or thir|teen,) and on that occa&s;ion goes to take the bath, with two married women behind her, &s;he makes a grand &s;alam to the prie&s;t, and ki&s;&s;es his private parts, hoping he will pray that they may have children. I took a great delight in going to &s;ee tho&s;e ceremonies.</P>
<P>After being five weeks at this place, we returned home towards the end of May.&mdash;We went down the river to Tannah. The gentlemen &s;lept in their barge on the river, and next day &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the governor, to let him know they would wait on him. Rammagee &s;ent his compliments, with a
<PB N="203" REF="215">
me&s;&s;age that he would be glad to &s;ee the gen|tlemen. He ordered a troop of hor&s;e, and a company of foot, to attend them into the ca&s;|tle. Rammagee paid great re&s;pect to Colo|nel Dow, becau&s;e he was the Commandant of the Sepoys. He was as much honoured at Tannah as a King in Europe, becau&s;e he commanded the black troops, and &s;poke the language of the country.</P>
<P>When the gentlemen left the ca&s;tle, the next place they went to &s;ee was the Portu|gueze or Roman Catholic Church. I fol|lowed the gentlemen there. I was very well dre&s;&s;ed; and the two havaldars, or Sepoy &s;erjeants, were with me. When we came near the church, the hor&s;e and foot &s;tood under arms. When they &s;aw us, and knew that I was the commandant's &s;teward, they &s;ounded the mu&s;ic and beat the drums, to give me two cheers. I took off my hat, and made a low bow; and the havaldars made
<PB N="204" REF="216">
them a grand &s;alam as we pa&s;&s;ed the ranks to follow the gentlemen into church. When the Colonel came out of church, he di&s;|charged the Sepoys, and took the hor&s;emen with him. The gentlemen were going two miles farther, to &s;ee &s;ome figures of the Gen|too Gods cut in the rock on the face of a hill. I had no de&s;ire, nor the havaldars, to go on, &s;o we returned; and we met Ru&s;tan and Bigo, the two Per&s;ian men. I a&s;ked them to go into a Roman Catholic public|hou&s;e, where I treated them with &s;ome Per|&s;ian brandy. Each ca&s;t had a cocoa-nut to drink out of; for they cannot drink with one another. I ordered the landlord to bring &s;ome fruit for each of them. They were all well plea&s;ed; and the ma&s;ter, his wife, and daughter, were very happy to &s;ee a white Chri&s;tian vi&s;itor. I drank out of their own cup; and the landlord broiled &s;ome fi&s;h called Sparling. So we fea&s;ted, each religion by it&s;elf, till the gentlemen returned to the
<PB N="205" REF="217">
barge to dinner. The Colonel gave the hor&s;emen forty rupees, and to the footmen twenty rupees; &s;o they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed very well plea&s;ed. The gentlemen played at cards and drank punch in the evening. Mr. Ram|&s;ay's two &s;ervants played on the fir&s;t and &s;e|cond french-horn, which very much enter|tained the inhabitants. Early the next morn|ing the tide carried us down the river into the &s;alt water, and the &s;ame day we arrived &s;afe at Bombay.</P>
<P>In the month of Augu&s;t, 1770, General Wedderburne arrived at Bombay from Eu|rope, with a commi&s;&s;ion from the Honour|able Ea&s;t-India Company to take the com|mand of the troops in Bombay: and Gene|ral Pimble was to take the command at Ma|dra&s;s, if he had lived. General Wedder|burne went to Parnell-hou&s;e in the country, to wait on Governor Hodges, with his com|mi&s;&s;ion; and next day he took the command
<PB N="206" REF="218">
of the troops in Bombay Green. This year was &s;pent very agreeably between the King's and the Company's &s;ervants at Bombay.</P>
<P>In the beginning of 1771, Sir Eyre Coote arrived at Bombay, on his way to Europe, from Madra&s;s. He &s;tayed &s;ome time, and was entertained by all the fir&s;t people of rank in the i&s;land. There was a grand re|view of all the troops belonging to Bombay and Old Woman's I&s;land, where the grand encampment was formed by General Coote and General Wedderburne. Sir Eyre Coote was going to Europe over land, through the de&s;erts of Arabia; and my ma&s;ter, who did not like Bombay, a&s;ked leave of Governor Hodges to accompany Sir Eyre to England. His reque&s;t was granted. When he came home, he told me he was to go to England, and that he was to have a &s;ale in two days of every thing that he had. But you mu&s;t get my cloaths, plate, books, and maps,
<PB N="207" REF="219">
packed up: give a grand dinner to the council and all the general officers. I had been ill a great while, and the fatigue of this dinner made me wor&s;e. I fooli&s;hly had got the di&s;order of the country, and had not ap|plied to a proper per&s;on at fir&s;t. I told the Colonel I was very ill, and he de&s;ired me to go to Dr. Richard&s;on. When I went to &s;ee the Doctor, he told me if I went with the Colonel I &s;hould lo&s;e my life. I went to the Colonel and told him.&mdash;He &s;aid, I am very &s;orry; then I mu&s;t take Stephen the cook with me; I can do no other. I went to Dr. Richard&s;on to a&s;k him if he would take me under his care in the ho&s;pital; for, as I did not belong to the company, I had no title to the ho&s;pital. He &s;aid that he would. When I found he would take me un|der his care, I &s;ent him, the &s;ame afternoon, a fa&s;hionable &s;ilver mug that co&s;t me five pounds in St. James's &s;treet, London. When the Colonel was going, he took me by the
<PB N="208" REF="220">
hand and &s;aid, that he had recommended me to Colonel Keating; and that if he came back, he would take me him&s;elf; and he paid me like an emperor. Next day I went into the ho&s;pital, and Mr. Richard&s;on put me in the fir&s;t ward; and, in every re&s;pect, treated me as the fir&s;t per&s;on there. I was there &s;ix weeks. When I was getting better, Colonel Keating &s;ent a me&s;&s;age, whenever I could get out, to come to his hou&s;e till I got better. I returned for an&s;wer, that I would; and that I was much obliged to him.</P>
<P>One day, as I was walking out early in the morning, on the out&s;ide of the gate, Major Pointing, who was exerci&s;ing the Se|poys on the green, when he &s;aw me, called me, and a&s;ked me how I did.&mdash;I told him I was getting well.&mdash;Well, John, will you come and live with me when you get better, or come to my hou&s;e whenever you like? I told him I was obliged to him, but that Co|lonel Keating had &s;poke to me to come to
<PB N="209" REF="221">
his hou&s;e. Then, &s;aid he, you will repent that. You know I have the be&s;t right to you, as I have taken your ma&s;ter's place; and, if you &s;erve me, you &s;hall order every thing as you like. I &s;aid, very well; I &s;hall &s;ee and give an an&s;wer, Sir. We &s;pent our time in the ward very plea&s;antly; they were gen|tlemen's &s;ons, mid&s;hipmen, or mates; we played at cards for tea, coffee, and &s;ugar, and &s;ometimes for our wine that we had in the ho&s;pital. So every thing was as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible. Next morning, when the doctors came round and did their bu&s;ine&s;s, Doctor Richard&s;on called me out of the ward, and a&s;ked me, if I intended to take a place, or go to England? I &s;aid I would take a place.&mdash;Very well; I &s;hall &s;peak to Governor Hodges to take you for his &s;teward; as he &s;poke to me &s;ome time ago to get him an European &s;teward to take the care of his cloaths, li|quors and plate; and if I can get that place for you it will be the making of you: and
<PB N="210" REF="222">
you may &s;leep in the ho&s;pital, or out, which you like. I told him I was much obliged to him. Next day Mr. Mathi&s;on, the &s;uper-cargo of the Duke of Cumberland, came to &s;ee me, and to a&s;k me to come to Colonel Keating's hou&s;e. The &s;hip was returned from Macoa. He &s;lept at Colonel Keating's, as he did at Colonel Dow's, before he went to Surat and Macoa: and he was very de|&s;irous to have me there on account of hav|ing his hair done.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance probably made him de&s;irous that I &s;hould come to Colonel Keating's. Mr. Mathi&s;on brought the fa|mous hor&s;e Chillabie from Macoa, at this time four years old; he was chained in Colonel's Keating's &s;table, by the head and legs. He had killed one Arab at Macoa; and, on the pa&s;&s;age, he had almo&s;t killed another; therefore the black man would not go near him. Mr. Mathi&s;on knew I under|&s;tood
<PB N="211" REF="223">
hor&s;es. I helped Mahomed, the coach|man, to break in two mules he &s;ent to Co|lonel Dow, when he went fir&s;t to Juddah. I went to the Colonel's hou&s;e; and, by that &s;tep, I lo&s;t the be&s;t opportunity ever offered to me. After I was there, and my things with me, I had not fortitude to come away again. All that I did was to dre&s;s their hair, and to give orders to the black hor&s;e-keepers about the mad hor&s;e, as they called him: for I had very little &s;trength after coming out of the ho&s;pital. This hor&s;e was called after a very rich merchant at Surat, who had eighteen or nineteen &s;hips of his own, and a great many Engli&s;h gentlemen in his &s;ervice. He lived a great while at Bombay for his plea&s;ure. He was a jovial hearty fellow, and broke through the rules of his religion to have company with the Engli&s;h gentle|men, and to drink wine. He was a great companion of General Wedderburne's, and of the fir&s;t rate men. He was a Mahometan,
<PB N="212" REF="224">
and his name was Chillabie. In a few days Mr. Richard&s;on &s;ent for me; he &s;aid he had &s;poke to the Governor about me, and I have given you a great character, &s;o that you may go to Parrella as &s;oon as you plea&s;e. I &s;aid, very well Sir; and I am very much obliged to you: I &s;hall go when I have cut and dre&s;&s;ed Colonel Keating's hair. When the Colonel was gone to a ball, I told Mr. Mathi&s;on that the Governor wanted me to live with him. He an&s;wered, if you go to Parrella, you will be confined in the country among&s;t a parcel of Per&s;ians; be&s;ides, the Governor is very changeable in his mind, and puts his whole confidence in Gentoo Bramins. He went and told Colonel Kea|ting; and next morning, after breakfa&s;t, Mr. Mathi&s;on a&s;ked me, if I went to the Gover|nor, or would hire my&s;elf to the Colonel. I &s;aid, gentlemen, whatever you think be&s;t. The Colonel &s;aid, John, your ma&s;ter recom|mended you to me, and I will give you as
<PB N="213" REF="225">
much as Mr. Hodges; and every one in my hou&s;e knows you. I will give you forty gui|neas a year, my old cloaths, and bed, board, and wa&s;hing.&mdash;You will have the charge of every thing in my hou&s;e. Bapu buys every thing for the hou&s;e, but he is not always here; and he likes you very much. I agreed to &s;tay; and the Governor was a little di&s;|plea&s;ed. Next time, the Governor had the Colonel to dine with him at Parella; and in conver&s;ation, after dinner, with the com|pany, he &s;aid, Colonel Keating, I do not like you becau&s;e you are &s;o partial to the Scots. I cannot help that, Governor Hodges, for I think when I meet Scotchmen that are good, they are the be&s;t of men. Colonel Keating was Commandant of artillery and principal engineer; he had as many atten|dants about him as a royal, or a noble prince in England. Bapu was his head &s;ervant; he had a plantation of his own, and a large fa|mily. As he was above taking wages, the
<PB N="214" REF="226">
Colonel made him a pre&s;ent now and then. Next to him were two Tindalls, petty offi|cers, and five La&s;cars, as &s;ervants, excu&s;ed from duty. Two would come in the morn|ing, and two to dinner, and two to &s;upper, ju&s;t as they liked; there was always enough of them, and the Colonel did not mind which: three cooks and three &s;lave-boys al|ways in the hou&s;e. A Tindall's command of twelve La&s;cars on guard, night and day, at the gate: and an Engli&s;h coachman and three black helpers in the &s;tables. When there was a large company at dinner, there was Bapu and Baba, and Shelk, and five La&s;cars, all in turbans, be&s;ides our &s;lave|boys and &s;trange &s;ervants, all waiting at din|ner. Bapu was over us all when he at|tended; when he did not, then I was head|man. In regard of dre&s;&s;ing the Colonel, and taking care of his cloaths, that was to my|&s;elf. I took care of the &s;ide-table, and Bapu took notice and &s;ent me wine, He never
<PB N="215" REF="227">
waited at table, but would &s;it down in the fenander, come in to &s;ee what the Colonel wanted, put down the dinner, and take it off. The Colonel's perqui&s;ites amounted to as much as the pay of the Commander in Chief. He had as many men at work under him, at cutting down rocks and building new fortifications, as co&s;t one hundred thou|&s;and rupees per month; and when he came in his palankin, after breakfa&s;t, to &s;ee &s;ome hundreds of men at work, he was taken more notice of than the King of England at St. James's on a court day. There was one Captain Macneal, an engineer, an Argyle|&s;hire gentleman, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Colonel in his works. When I came I took a little trouble off his hand, in regard of receiving all the Colonel's money, as I was always in the way. I had a drawer that ran on wheels, to keep the money in. A paper was brought to me to receive &s;o much money. I took care of the paper and gave an account of the
<PB N="216" REF="228">
money. When a bill was to be paid, the Colo|nel put his name to the bottom. I received the bill and paid the contents; which le&s;&s;ened Captain Macneal's trouble at home. When Bapu was to have a &s;um of money, he brought the order, and I paid the money to him. I took care of the papers, and what I paid I marked in my book.</P>
<P>In two months after I was there, the Co|lonel was taken with a putrid fever. He was &s;o extremely ill that, for twelve nights, I never went to bed, nor pulled off my cloaths: he had no nur&s;e but me. The doctors were all called for. On the tenth day he was given over: his friends were cal|led, and his will was made and read to him in my hearing. At twelve o'clock he &s;aid, now, my friends, leave me to re&s;t. After the gentlemen had &s;upped they went home, and all the black men were a&s;leep, for they are naturally very &s;leepy; and I lay on the
<PB N="217" REF="229">
bed with the Colonel, wetting his lips with a feather while he was motionle&s;s. At throe I took a looking-gla&s;s to put over his mouth to &s;ee if there was any life. By the gla&s;s I found there was life. I knew there would be a change at four in the morning; becau&s;e at four, the morning before, he changed from better to wor&s;e. As I expected, &s;o it plea&s;ed God, that from four, he received &s;trength more and more, as you would &s;ee the &s;ea flow. The gentlemen &s;ent in the morning, to know if the Colonel was dead or not. But, to their great &s;urpri&s;e and comfort, they &s;aw him &s;itting up in the bed to breakfa&s;t. At nine o'clock his friends were very happy, for they never expected to &s;ee him in life again. The Doctors &s;aid I had done great things; and they recom|mended me to go to bed, which I did. The Colonel got out of danger; but his di&s;order was not gone. He changed his bed from
<PB N="218" REF="230">
one room to another. And I &s;lept in the room wherever he went.</P>
<P>By this time Governor Hodges was taken ill, and his illne&s;s increa&s;ed; and the Colonel was &s;o happy that he was better, that he told me one morning, with much &s;atisfac|tion, that he dreamed in the night, he was playing at cards with Death, and beat Death. I an&s;wered, then Sir, you will certainly get the better of your illne&s;s. His di&s;order turned to an ague. He went to his country hou&s;e at Randal Lodge. It &s;tood on the &s;ide of Malabar Hill. He was there two months. From thence he went to Mr. Ram&s;ay's, at Mayan, where he remained one month; and afterwards to Mr. Jarvis's hou&s;e in the woods. Here we re|mained three weeks; then we went back to Mr. Ram&s;ay's again for a change. By this time the Governor was got &s;o ill, that he was de&s;ired to go to Bencoot, by his phy|&s;ician,
<PB N="219" REF="231">
where General Pimble died and was buried; this made my ma&s;ter afraid. Gover|nor Hodges al&s;o was at Bencoot till he died. His remains were brought to Bombay; he had a very grand burial; he was laid in the church. The Colonel came to town again for a month; but there was &s;o much com|pany to di&s;turb him, that he went to Ran|dal Lodge; but the putrid fever &s;tuck about him &s;till. After all the doctors could do for him, he mu&s;t go to Bencoot for the be|nefit of the air. A ve&s;&s;el was procured and every thing got ready. The Colonel took me, the two Tindalls, Baba and Sheek, two cooks, two peons to run before him, one to carry the umbrella and the flambeaux; and &s;ix haymalls to carry the palankin.</P>
<P>We &s;et &s;ail early in the morning, and with a fair wind arrived at Fort Victoria, where the Ea&s;t-India Company had one hundred and twenty as fine Sepoys as ever I &s;aw,
<PB N="220" REF="232">
be&s;ides their officers and non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers. The fir&s;t gunner was born at Aberdeen in Scotland; he had been there &s;ixteen years, and was as black with the heat as the Sepoys. The chief was Mr. Cheap. The ca&s;tle, and Mr. Cheap's hou&s;e, &s;tood on a high hill near the &s;ea, and a large river. It is a beautiful country, and a number of different fruit-trees grow along the face of the hill. The&s;e Sepoys had nothing to do but to mount guard at the Chief's gate. A fine ea&s;y life they had. We had many &s;orts of fi&s;h, chickens, mutton, lamb, and &s;everal other &s;orts of provi&s;ion. We lived very well. There were only four gentlemen, the Colo|nel, Mr. Cheap, Mr. Forbes, and Mr. Arden. They went out in the afternoon, the Colonel in his palankin, and the gentlemen on hor&s;eback. As for me, I walked where I would for my plea&s;ure, with my little Sepoy called Toby. The Colonel let me have him for what I wanted. Wherever he went he
<PB N="221" REF="233">
was called my little Sepoy. All he had to do for the Colonel, was to clean a pair of &s;hoes, clean the night-pan, to do what I wanted, and to walk out with me. The Co|lonel reviewed the Sepoys, and had two of them flogged for &s;leeping on guard. It was only to teach them to know their duty. The Colonel told Mr. Cheap, that Seedy might come and take the fort without firing a gun. Seedy was a Sovereign Prince, who&s;e country lay near our's, and Fort Victoria would have been of great &s;ervice to him.</P>
<P>The Colonel got a great deal better by the air of Bencoot, and by taking the bark. When the Colonel was three weeks at Ben|coot, he had a de&s;ire to go up the river forty miles to the hot wells, to take the bath. The name of the place where the wells are is Darygan. The Colonel went in Mr. Cheap's barge. I am going to men|tion one remark that was made by General
<PB N="222" REF="234">
Pimble's lady at Bombay, at dinner. The day we &s;et &s;ail for Bencoot, when &s;he was &s;peaking to the ladies about my ma&s;ter, &s;he &s;aid, General Pimble went for his health to Bencoot, with Adam la Plue, his &s;ervant, and never returned. The Governor went, and he died. Now we will &s;ee what will become of Colonel Keating and John Macdonald. I will mention another thing before we go up the ri|ver, which may not be di&s;agreeable. The barge contained the &s;our gentlemen, my&s;elf, and Baba, and Sheek, the two non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers, as worthy fellows as ever lived. Their bu&s;ine&s;s was to prepare for the table; they never cleaned a knife, all the dirty work was done by by the coolies that carried the palankins. Every one had his bu&s;ine&s;s; and, according to their ca&s;t, they eat toge|ther. The Moormen could not eat with the Gentoos, nor the Gentoos with the Moor|men. Baba and Sheek were Mahometans, and Mr. Cheap's man al&s;o, and the Gentoos
<PB N="223" REF="235">
at dinner by them&s;elves. Our two cooks and Toby, and the other two gentlemen's &s;er|vants, dined together, and I by my&s;elf, when the gentlemen had done: where they dre&s;&s;ed their food under a tree they drew a circle round, and none of the other could come within that line. Before the Colonel's Lady went to England (for at this time &s;he was in London about bu&s;ine&s;s, and knew nothing of his illne&s;s) &s;he a&s;ked the favour of Bapu, Baba, and Sheek, to bring their wives to &s;ee her, and &s;he would treat them with fruits and &s;weetmeats. Bapu made an&s;wer, Madam, we are much obliged to you for your invitation, but we cannot do this: to let our wives vi&s;it any European, nor let them vi&s;it us; if we did, we &s;hould lo&s;e our ca&s;t, and be de&s;pi&s;ed by our relations, and every one of our religion. Our Lady's maid, Syl|via, who was a Malabar girl, has been to &s;ee them at their hou&s;es; and &s;he &s;aid, that Bapu's wife had as many bangels and jewels
<PB N="224" REF="236">
as co&s;t four or five hundred pounds, for he was very rich; but Baba and Sheek were poorer.</P>
<P>We prowed up the beautiful river of Mart in the Coolie boats, &s;ometimes u&s;ing a &s;ail, and at other times oars on each &s;ide. It was very plea&s;ant; mo&s;tly very high hills, co|vered with fine trees of different &s;orts, rivu|lets running down at different places, and the mangoes hanging on the trees, and other fruits in our view. It was a beautiful &s;cene, as we &s;ailed along, to &s;ee the rocks, hills, and trees, and the birds of different kinds. We arrived at Darygan next morning. The place where the wells &s;tood was level, and about two miles round, almo&s;t &s;urrounded by mountains and groves. The waters were as hot as at Bath in England. The Colonel went into the bath early in the morning, and in the afternoon the gentlemen went out in their palankins; and then I took the
<PB N="225" REF="237">
bath, to cure me of my late illne&s;s. The gentlemen employed their time here in the &s;ame manner as Colonel Dow and his party did at the hot wells at Dillinagogue. The citron trees grew in plenty before our hou&s;e, and round the valley, and the fine large fruit hung on the trees in abundance. The coun|try people minded them no more than a frog-&s;tool. The Colonel had a great many pre&s;erved in jars, and taken to Bombay. As this was a Gentoo country, there happened to be &s;ome grand holidays, not yearly, but upon a particular occa&s;ion, which only hap|pens very &s;eldom. Monday was the day to draw the people together. In the great grove the Gentoos meet, dance in different po&s;tures, and throw a holy red powder on one another. They are dre&s;&s;ed with flowers, particularly the women. They eat fruits and &s;weet-meats. Baba and Sheek were glad to &s;ee this f&ecirc;te as well as I. I a&s;ked Baba what that &s;tage was for, &s;ix feet high, and as much
<PB N="226" REF="238">
&s;quare? At the end of the &s;tage is a large po&s;t, eighteen feet high, with another of an equal length or more, fixed on the top of the po&s;t properly with an iron bolt; &s;o that the one acro&s;s runs round like a weather-cock with ea&s;e. Sheek &s;aid, Mr. John, you will &s;ee the grand ceremony to-morrow. Next day the f&ecirc;te was grander than the day be|fore, with mu&s;ic, dancing, dre&s;s, and fea&s;t|ing. A great many of the gentlemen Gen|toos came from the city of Marr, and among&s;t them one very rich, and a great and good man. He had been married years, and had no children. I was told prayers had been put up by the Bramins in the pagodas; at la&s;t he had an only &s;on. In return, he pub|licly goes through a torment in honour of his Creator, and the pure and undefiled Gen|too religion; and his name is handed down to po&s;terity among&s;t the worthy as a &s;aint, and his family re&s;pected.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="239">
When the operation was to begin, he was &s;eated on a table, under one of the ends of the crofs pole; an inci&s;ion is made in each &s;ide, under his ribs, to let in each hole a &s;mooth iron hook, like tho&s;e that let down a butt of beer to a cellar in London, with a &s;tring from the rope that draws him up, round the brea&s;t, to keep him from pitching forward, and to keep him in the &s;ame po&s;i|tion. With the irons in his &s;ide, he is drawn up in a moment with a pulley. When he is up, there is one over him, who cro&s;&s;es a rope to hold him there. His hands and feet are tied that he cannot &s;tir. But take notice, there are weights on the other end of the cro&s;s pole, to balance the per&s;on who is drawn up, and he who fixes him. So the mu&s;ic is playing, &s;ome are crying, others praying for him to get through his mi&s;ery. At the other end of the pole a rope is fixed, which a man takes hold of, and runs him round three times. Whenever he came to the &s;ame
<PB N="228" REF="240">
place, they gave him a cheer; &s;o he had three cheers when he had gone round three times. He was taken down in a moment, a cordial given him, his wounds were dre&s;&s;ed, and he was carried home in triumph, with beating of drums, and mu&s;ic playing. Tho&s;e who remain behind dance in different com|panies.</P>
<P>At the top of the grove were the figures of their gods. Fir&s;t was Ram, a man drawn with ten heads and twenty arms, to denote wi&s;dom and &s;trength; with a company of men and women dancing round him, like the ring in Greenwich Park. Next was Gunne&s;s, a man with four arms, and an ele|phant's head, to denote great wi&s;dom and power. Next was Drougah and his wife; and, on the left of all, Ma&s;a&s;&s;oor, a man. There was the Globe of the Earth, the Ox, which is in all their pagodas, the Dove and Serpent al&s;o, and the Turtle. I went home,
<PB N="229" REF="241">
and the fir&s;t time I &s;aw Vi&s;tenorgee, a Gen|too, who was the Colonel's purvoo, or head clerk, I a&s;ked him what the meaning of all the figures I &s;aw might be? He &s;aid, Ram was their principal agent between them and God; when he was on earth, he had con|ver&s;ation with God, and whatever he &s;aid was a law with God; and how he beat and de&s;troyed kings; and he gives us this coun|try to live in. By what Vi&s;tenorgee told me, I found the Gentoos were the de&s;cendants of the children of Abraham, by Keturah, whom he &s;ent into the ea&s;t country, to pu&s;h their fortune, and to be out of the way of his &s;on I&s;aac. Whenever you meet a Gentoo, they will &s;ay, Ram, Ram; that is to &s;ay, God ble&s;s you. By what I could under&s;tand of what he told me, Ram is for Abraham, Drougah and his wife for I&s;aac and Rebecca, and Gunne&s;s is in re|membrance of Jacob, of his wi&s;dom, and power with God. The Ox they wor&s;hip,
<PB N="230" REF="242">
as being the cu&s;tom in the Ea&s;t at that time. The Dove and the Serpent, to &s;hew you to be wi&s;e as a &s;erpent, and harmle&s;s as a dove. The Earth, in remembrance of their fore|father Adam and Eve, who had the whole world under their command. The Turtle, to &s;hew you to be &s;atisfied with plenty and with poverty; as the turtle can live in the plentiful &s;ea, and out of his element, on dry land. Ma&s;a&s;&s;oor they look on as a wicked being, &s;o they wor&s;hip him for fear while they live, and, when dead, deceive the demon, by burning the body, and throwing the a&s;hes in water, that he may not have it. The Gentoos never indulge unruly lu&s;t, nor run into any ex|ce&s;s of wickedne&s;s, but keep in every re&s;pect to the form of their religion. If God approved of the conduct of the Reckabites, who would not obey Jeremiah, who was &s;ent from God with a me&s;&s;age, but their father's old com|mands, (Jeremiah xxxv.) how much more &s;hall he excu&s;e tho&s;e Gentoos, who never
<PB N="231" REF="243">
had the Bible to go by or direct them? The Colonel was getting better every day, by drinking the waters, and taking the bath, &s;o that he was in very good &s;pirits, and I was very happy in my own mind that he was re|covering, and that I &s;hould have the plea|&s;ure of his returning to Bombay in perfect health; he eat very hearty, and drank mo|derately, and every thing was agreeable.</P>
<P>The gentlemen went out four miles in their palankin. In the evening they played at cards, and were merry, and all the attend|ants were happy with one another; the black men would have done any thing to oblige me, owing to my humility and good temper, though I &s;ay it my&s;elf. I gave them onions and gee, and curry &s;tuff to dre&s;s their victuals, whenever they a&s;ked me for any, for I had enough, and could buy whenever I plea&s;ed. They liked me &s;o much, that they would have done any thing to deliver me out of trouble
<PB N="232" REF="244">
if I had been in any; and they &s;aid, Mr. John, you are a very good man, God is very good to you. I paid every man his board wages on Monday morning; every &s;et by them&s;elves. I paid the Havaldar, and he paid the Se|poys. One day I took notice of the heat as I was walking by the river &s;ide, when the gentlemen were a&s;leep. The cattle lay down in the water. The crows &s;tretched out their wings on the trees to cool them&s;elves, and panting for breath. I went into the room where the Colonel was a&s;leep, and looked at the thermometer, which was up at ninety-four. I took it and hung it under the mangoe tree to have the natural air of the country. I ob&s;erved, in half an hour, it got up to one hundred and eighteen degrees of heat. I let it &s;tand half an hour longer, and it neither &s;tirred up nor down. I carried it in again to its place. When the gentlemen got up and went to &s;it under the mangoe-tree for the air, where I put the thermometer, where
<PB N="233" REF="245">
they drank tea, I told the Colonel I had been making two experiments when he was a&s;leep. What were they John? I took the thermometer and hung it under this tree, on the nail; and, in half an hour, it got up to one hundred and eighteen: I let it &s;tand half an hour, but it never &s;tirred. Sir, this was half an hour pa&s;t two, and now it is five o'clock. The gentlemen &s;aid, good God, is it po&s;&s;ible! they were &s;upri&s;ed to hear it. And, Sir, I have been making &s;ome tea of the citron leaves of the tree we gathered the citrons off to pre&s;erve, and I have it ready. I brought the tea to them, and they liked it much; and &s;aid, they never ta&s;ted finer tea, nor any thing more plea&s;ant to drink. By this time we had been here four weeks; and I had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee the city of Marr, about two miles and a half from Darrygan, higher up the other &s;ide of the river. After breakfa&s;t I a&s;ked the Co|lonel to let me to to Marr and &s;ee the place?
<PB N="234" REF="246">
Certainly, John, if you like; and you may take Baba or Sheek. Very well; Sir, I am obliged to you. I ordered the dinner, and told Sheek and Baba I was going to &s;ee Marr; and that either of them that liked to go might dre&s;s them&s;elves. They were both de&s;irous to go: &s;o they drew lots who &s;hould go, and Sheek gained; and Baba to be with the Co|lonel at home. As the palankin-men were not wanted till the afternoon, I took four of them to carry us through the river, and they were very happy to go. I took the Havaldar al&s;o; we cro&s;&s;ed the water; the road was plea&s;ant. On both &s;ides were little hills covered with trees.</P>
<P>Before we came to the fir&s;t Chochee, where was a Havaldar, Naigee, and &s;ome Sepoys, we &s;aw one of the Sepoys running towards Marr. When we came to the Cho|chee they turned out and made us a &s;alam, and we returned it. The Havaldar a&s;ked us
<PB N="235" REF="247">
&s;ome que&s;tions. We an&s;wered; and we a&s;ked, what the Sepoys were gone on for? The Ha|valdar &s;aid it was to give notice there was an European coming to the office of the next Chochee: and he &s;ent another Sepoy to the Governor to let him know there was an Eu|ropean coming to Marr: but of what &s;tation he did not know. I &s;aid to Sheek, it is very odd they took any notice of us. Sheek &s;aid, they think you are a gentleman becau&s;e you are dre&s;&s;ed in &s;carlet and that fine gold-laced hat. They think you are one of the gen|tlemen at the hot-wells, Mr. John, be|cau&s;e there are &s;ix of us attending you: in this country, they think every one that wears &s;carlet and gold to be a great man; and we are glad they think &s;o. When we came to the &s;econd Chochee, we &s;at down, becau&s;e the Havaldar was a Moorman of Sheek's ca&s;t. We had toddy to drink; and, &s;oon after, a fine young man, a Jemmetdar or Lieutenant, came from the Governor to
<PB N="236" REF="248">
know who I was. Sheek told the Jemmetdar I was Steward to one Colonel Keating that was at the hot-wells; and that I was de&s;irous to &s;ee the town. The Jemmetdar returned to the Governor; and, at the &s;ame time, I went to &s;ee the Roman Catholic church; and he came to us again, and told us the Governor de&s;ired him to walk with us. We went to &s;ee the pagodas, the tank for bathing, all the Governor's hor&s;es, and all the elephants and the camels; and to walk all round the town, which was very plea|&s;ant. The people followed, in hundreds, to &s;ee us. I &s;aid to Sheek, the&s;e pretty girls are very fond to &s;ee us. He &s;aid, Mr. John, they never &s;aw a white man before, one half of tho&s;e people: and you are a very fine picture. Mr. John, the girls are very glad to &s;ee you. We went into a Portugue&s;e hou&s;e. I had rice and currie; and I had arrack enough for the coolies to drink. Sheek had &s;ome bread-fi&s;h to eat, but he drank
<PB N="237" REF="249">
nothing but water. The Roman-Catholic landlord was very happy; he and I drank hearty together; and he &s;aid, I was the very fir&s;t white man that ever was in his hou&s;e. We were very merry; &s;o I paid and came to the end of the town, when I gave the Jem|metdar two rupees, and took our leave. We came home about &s;ix o'clock. I told the Co|lonel what u&s;age we had. He &s;aid the Gover|nor behaved very much like a gentleman, by &s;ending the officer with you. It was ex|tremely re&s;pectful. By the time we were here five weeks, the Colonel was got &s;trong and hearty, and was thinking of go|ing home again, and to go over land, and not by water. Mr. Cheap &s;ent us forty coolies to carry our baggage. It took twenty coolies to carry our provi&s;ion che&s;t, &s;o we &s;et out from Darreygan in the morning, with &s;even|ty-five men and boys, four hor&s;es, ten bul|locks, two cows, and two calves. Mr. Cheap came two days journey with us, and
<PB N="238" REF="250">
then took the Sepoys home with him. We &s;et off early in the morning on account of the coolies. We did not travel in the middle of the day for the heat, but the morning and after|noon the gentlemen rode in their palankins, &s;o altogether we were like a little army. The country, in compari&s;on, was like a large garden, &s;o many &s;orts of fine trees, with the fruit hanging on them in plenty. As we had every thing with us that was nece&s;&s;ary, we furni&s;hed our places where we &s;topped in ten minutes. We commonly &s;topped where there were a great many &s;hady trees, for we could not go into the people's hou&s;es. No chri&s;tian is admitted, and there are no inns on the road; but they would &s;ell us, fowls, eggs, fi&s;h, milk, and fire-wood, and the cook would &s;et up a pot, or a &s;pit, in a few minutes, and we could buy provender for the hor&s;es and cows, and &s;et them a eating. The fir&s;t place we &s;topped at, was a village under large mangoe trees. We put our tea-kettle to boil,
<PB N="239" REF="251">
and &s;et our tea-table and chairs, and there were a hundred, or &s;everal hundreds, to &s;ee them at breakfa&s;t, every thing about us was &s;o &s;trange to them. They have no chairs, but &s;it on the ground: my chair was the pro|vi&s;ion che&s;t, where I had the liquors. We &s;topped to breakfa&s;t about ten, and there was time enough to dre&s;s dinner; we went on the road again after three, and went on till near dark. We pitched at Lowoos, and furni&s;hed our hou&s;e as before; we lighted up candles, and put the liquor on the table, the Colonel to bed, and the other gentlemen &s;lept in their palankins. I &s;lept in my hammock, fixed up between two trees.</P>
<P>The gentlemen had a hot dinner and &s;up|per, as if they had been at home. When I was marking down the money I laid out, Mr. Cheap a&s;ked the Colonel if I kept a journal, the Colonel an&s;wered, I believe John keeps a journal of the rupees. This

night the gentlemen &s;upped in publick; there was no danger of any rain coming. It was not the rainy &s;ea&s;on at this time of the year.</P>
<P>I called the gentlemen before four in the morning, and I called Baba and Sheek, and they called the others, for the black men &s;leep &s;ound. In half an hour we were all off the ground, and we went by the light of the mo&s;al, or flambeau, till day-light. This day we had a mountain to go over three miles high. We got to the bottom or fir&s;t part of the mountain about nine o'clock. We could get no water on the road. As we were beginning to go up, there was a hole, where there was a little dirty water. I put my handkerchief over the hole, and &s;ucked the water through it, and the other men took the dirty water up with a &s;poon, and drank it. We got up the mountain with hard work. On the top was the fine&s;t &s;ight I ever &s;aw, ju&s;t like a plea&s;ure garden, with &s;o many trees
<PB N="241" REF="255">
and flowers, and the meal was &s;o fine, when we were beginning to go down the other &s;ide of the mountain, I was very happy in my own mind to &s;ee the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The &s;un &s;hined very hot upon us; but, in|&s;tead of the &s;ea, what we &s;aw two miles be|low us was a white cloud. The mountain was called Lowoo. When we de&s;cended from the mountains, we came into a plea&s;ant val|ley, where was a plenty of water for man and bea&s;t. We pitched be&s;ide the river of Lowoo, under &s;ome very large oak trees. We were all very hungry, for we had come a great way that morning; we got breakfa&s;t as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and afterwards we lay on the gra&s;s under the trees and &s;lept, and there were plenty of trees to cover the cattle, and plenty of gra&s;s to eat.</P>
<P>There was a Gentoo gentleman that dined where we did. He made the gentlemen a pre|&s;ent
<PB N="242" REF="256">
&s;ent of &s;ome fine mangoes; and my ma&s;ter gave him &s;ome pens and paper. We had plenty of fine fi&s;h, and &s;ome fowls dre&s;&s;ed here for dinner. The cattle lay down in the river, and we &s;aw a great many Gentoo women of the village wa&s;hing their cloaths oppo&s;ite to us. There was one thing on our &s;ide, we never had any thing to pay for our lodging-place, nor for our fruits; all was free.</P>
<P>We &s;et out after dinner, and at night ar|rived at a Mahomedan mo&s;que and burying ground. The burying ground was very large and plea&s;ant, therefore the gentlemen made it their lodging place, as it was &s;haded with fine trees. Baba and Sheek were very happy, as the prie&s;t of the mo&s;que was of their own fect. We all &s;lept in the church-yard, the gentlemen &s;lept in their palankins, and I made my hammock on the grave of a Ma|homedan, and &s;lept with plea&s;ure on the grave of a man I never &s;aw. The Colonel de&s;ired
<PB N="243" REF="257">
me to give the prie&s;t twenty rupees. He put up a prayer for him and all his attendants. We went to &s;leep; and the u&s;ual time to call was four in the morning. I was the alarm cock; called Baba and Sheek, and they alarmed the others.</P>
<P>When I was helping the Colonel on with his cloaths, I &s;aid, Sir, I have made a mi&s;|take. What is that, John? Sir, it is only three, in&s;tead of four. He &s;aid, John, it is a very good mi&s;take. We &s;et off, and by day-light Mr. Cheap and the Sepoy went home.</P>
<P>On that day we pa&s;&s;ed through a fine level country, and pa&s;&s;ed by three pagodas, and &s;ome fine villages. The Colonel called me on the road in the morning, and &s;aid, John, I am going to &s;end Baba on with a me&s;&s;age to Raggagee Angerry a &s;overeign prince, he lives on our way to Bombay, and we are now going through his country. It is about twen|ty-&s;ix
<PB N="244" REF="258">
miles to Cowrie, where he lives; and I intend to be there all night. I want you to give Baba Mr. Cheap's hor&s;e, as he will go quicker on to the place. I gave Baba the hor&s;e, and I got on the bullock; he had very high horns, and they &s;tood &s;treight up; &s;o I made a genteel appearance. We travelled till eleven o'clock; then we pitched at the bot|tom of a mountain, where there was a grove, and a fine &s;pring running out of the rock. We breakfa&s;ted there with plea&s;ure, and after dinner, at three, &s;et off for Cowrie, in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Raggagee Angerry, when he had re|ceived the me&s;&s;age, &s;ent three different men on hor&s;eback, one after another, to let the Colonel know he was extremely welcome, and that every thing &s;hould be ready for him and all his attendants. The Colonel &s;ent one of the hor&s;emen back, to let the Prince know he was coming, and then &s;top with us. Each of the hor&s;emen
<PB N="245" REF="259">
wore a &s;pear in his hand, and they rode a fine Arabian hor&s;e each.</P>
<P>Towards &s;even, we &s;topped to water our men, hor&s;es, bullocks, cows, and calves. I &s;aid to the Colonel, Sir, here is a fine well of water, and fine &s;hady trees; for I thought we &s;hould be late. This is as plea&s;ant a place as you have been at yet. The Colonel told Mr. Forbes and Mr. Orpin, John wants to coax me to &s;tay here all night, but I will not be prevailed on; I &s;hall go on to Cowrie.</P>
<P>We arrived between eight and nine: when we came near the fortification, I was &s;ur|prized to &s;ee the great elephant between me and the light of the moon. When the Colo|nel came to the hou&s;e made ready for him, there were upwards of twenty noblemen and gentlemen to receive him; each of them &s;a|luted him doubly, &s;o that I was in pain for the Colonel till it was over. He went in and
<PB N="246" REF="260">
conver&s;ed with them. They told him the Prince would wait on him in the morning.</P>
<P>There was a Havaldar and his Sepoys or|dered to mount guard at the Colonel's door, and there was plenty of provi&s;ion &s;ent us; fi&s;h, fowl, rice, curry &s;tuff, milk, &amp;c. for all the attendants, and hay and grain for the cattle. We had no hot &s;upper that night, becau&s;e the cooks were not come up. The gentlemens two &s;ervants were walking after us on the road, with their French horns on their &s;houlders, and our two cooks along with them. They often &s;topped to eat fruit, and being three miles behind the Jemmetdar, the commanding officer of a garri&s;on, as we came along, took them pri&s;oners, to give them up to us next day: but at twelve at night the whole guard fell a&s;leep, and they made their e&s;cape, and came up to us in the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="261">
This day was certainly the mo&s;t entertain|ing and plea&s;ant ever &s;een: the gentlemen breakfa&s;ted under the jerrander, and before them were all the troughs for wa&s;hing the elephants, and they were cleaned before them. The Colonel &s;aid, one of tho&s;e crea|tures could devour us all, and, for all that, they &s;tand like lambs to be ruled by their keepers. And the &s;table where &s;ix hundred hor&s;es &s;tood was before the hou&s;e. The gentlemen went to &s;ee the hor&s;es, and the place where the elephants &s;tood.</P>
<P>The elephants were all brought and har|ne&s;&s;ed before the Colonel. At the de&s;ire of their keepers they lay down to be harne&s;&s;ed, and to have the chariot put on their backs; and at their de&s;ire they got up again.</P>
<P>The place where we were at pre&s;ent, was clo&s;e by the &s;ea &s;ide. Each elephant had a petty officer and two men to attend and
<PB N="248" REF="262">
clean him; and two of them were taken into the fortification that was at the end of the town, where were three thou&s;and men, fine fellows. The elephants came back &s;oon with twelve fine girls, mo&s;t rich and finely dre&s;&s;ed. They &s;topped for all the elephants and a troop of hor&s;e to attend the Prince to &s;ee the Co|lonel.</P>
<P>The Prince lived in a &s;trong ca&s;tle, on an i&s;land in the &s;ea, about half a mile from &s;hore. When high water, the &s;ea came round the i&s;land, and when low water, a man could walk to the ca&s;tle and not wet his &s;hoes.</P>
<P>The fortification in the i&s;land was &s;trongly fortified. About ten o'clock we &s;aw Raggagee Angerry with &s;ix elephants and a troop of hor&s;e and Sepoys, with a band of mu&s;ick along the &s;ands. I told the Colonel the Prince was coming. He turned about to meet him, and the two gentlemen attending the
<PB N="249" REF="263">
Colonel. The fir&s;t elephant carried the &s;tandard, next the Colonel of the light hor&s;e, and after him the Prince, then &s;ome of his Lords and gentlemen. When they alighted, the Colonel &s;aluted the Prince and his com|pany, and went into the hou&s;e, where they conver&s;ed for two hours, mu&s;ick playing the whole time. While they were in the hou&s;e, I was admiring the elephants and the hor&s;e|men. Each man had a &s;word by his &s;ide, and a &s;pear in his right hand. The Prince made pre&s;ents to the gentlemen, and &s;aid to Sheek, I think I &s;aw another European dre&s;&s;ed in &s;carlet.&mdash;Yes, your highne&s;s, there is a very good man, &s;teward to the Colonel, he pays all the money for the Colonel's at|tendants and his hou&s;e-keeping. Call him in, &s;aid the Prince, that I may &s;ee him. He gave me a turban and a piece of &s;ilk worked with gold, and he gave the &s;ame to Baba and Sheek. I made a grand &s;alam and retired. When he was going, the elephants were cal|led
<PB N="250" REF="264">
up, and fell down on their bellies till the Prince got into his chariot by a ladder, and in like manner did all the other gentlemen. There was only the body of a chariot, &s;et on a thing like a mattra&s;s to &s;ave the ele|phant's back, fixed on by a flat chain, girth, crupper, and brea&s;t plate. Each elephant had a driver, who &s;at on his neck, and two &s;ervants on his back behind the chariot. When they were all &s;eated on the elephant, they went away in the &s;ame order as they came; then the gentlemen &s;at down in proper form to a good dinner. The people were much entertained by &s;eeing the gentlemen &s;it on chairs round a table to dinner, for they them|&s;elves have no tables, but &s;it on a carpet on the floor to eat. After dinner, the Colonel of the light hor&s;e went with the gentlemen to &s;hew them all the gardens, bathing places for the Gentoos, and the grand Pagoda that Raggagee Angerry had built; we looked in at the door, and &s;aw the lamp burning, but
<PB N="251" REF="265">
we could not enter, being Chri&s;tians; they returned to tea, and the Colonel of the light hor&s;e drank two di&s;hes of coffee, made by a Gentoo &s;ervant. My ma&s;ter prevailed on him to &s;it on the chair, and they conver&s;ed toge|ther. My ma&s;ter told him of the works that were carrying on under his command at Bombay, which co&s;t the Honourable Com|pany one hundred thou&s;and rupees per month. After tea, the gentlemen played at cards, and the Gentoo Colonel left them at nine o'clock. Raggagee Angerry ordered the Aid-de-camp to go and &s;ee the Colonel &s;afe to Bombay. Next morning we &s;et off early, and we had one of the Prince's trumpeters on hor&s;eback before us, to &s;ound his trum|pet when we were going through any town.</P>
<P>When we came out&s;ide the Prince's parks, we &s;ervants fell behind to &s;top at a publick-hou&s;e. I offered to treat them with &s;ome toddy. They brought &s;ome to each of
<PB N="252" REF="266">
them in a cocoa-nut, for each ca&s;t. The landlady did not offer me, at fir&s;t; but was prevailed upon, at la&s;t, to bring &s;ome arrack in a cocoa nut-&s;hell. All this day's journey was near the &s;ea-&s;ide in the Prince's coun|try. In the evening we came to Abdalla, belonging to the Prince, where we had every thing at the Prince's expence. Next morning the ve&s;&s;el arrived to take us over to Bombay. The trumpeter was &s;ent back to Cowrie, and we all got on board and ar|rived &s;afe at Bombay that day. His friends were glad to &s;ee him return, and the Doctor recommended him to live at his country hou&s;e, Randall Lodge, on Malabar Hill, for the benefit of the air, and to u&s;e the bark; and accordingly he did &s;o. His friends came to &s;ee him in the country. He went to town to do bu&s;ine&s;s; and when he had a large company he received them in his town-hou&s;e; &s;o I remained in the country, and Baba had the command in town. I always
<PB N="253" REF="267">
had one of the cooks and Tobie, to &s;tay with me when the Colonel was in town. At the country-hou&s;e there was a Tindall that had the care of the hou&s;e, &s;lept there, and had a Gentoo girl that lived with him and pa&s;&s;ed for his wife. She de&s;ired the favour of me to give her an old &s;hirt; and I gave two one day. All the men were in town; and the girl and her niece were a&s;leep in the verandah, at the window of my room. I gave her a &s;hirt, and &s;he made my bed, and was afterwards very handy; and I gave the Tindall and her a little arrack now and then.</P>
<P>One night the Colonel came home late. I put him to bed, and walked into the veran|dah, where all the &s;ervants were a-&s;leep in different places. The veranda is like a &s;hade in England, to keep off the rain and the &s;un, where the gentlemen &s;it in the day|time, and enjoy the air. I laid down on the Gentoo girl's left &s;ide; and, putting my
<PB N="254" REF="268">
hand on her, waked and &s;urpri&s;ed her much. In a moment &s;he put her hand to my head, and di&s;covered, from my hair be|ing cued, who it was. I would not intrude: but I went to bed. Next day I told her &s;he &s;hould not lie &s;o near the other people: &s;o &s;he &s;ent her niece home, and laid the matt very near the window of my room. I thought it was not &s;o hot where they lay, as in the room; &s;o I lay &s;ometimes in the verandah; and then I put black things on, that I might not be di&s;covered. Ro&s;illa told me, if I lay &s;o near her again, &s;he would tell the Tindall. I a&s;ked her, &s;everal times, to eat with me when the Tindall was pre|&s;ent, but &s;he would not. <Q REND="inline">"People of our ca&s;t cannot eat any food dre&s;&s;ed for a Chri|&s;tian, nor have any connection with tho&s;e out of our own ca&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>I am going to give my readers a &s;mall account of the i&s;land of Bombay. It is
<PB N="255" REF="269">
about fourteen miles long; the town, of the &s;ame name, being at one end of the i&s;land, where all the &s;hipping and all the bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on. At the other end is the town of Mayam, where there is a fortification.</P>
<P>In the middle of the i&s;land is the Gover|nor's hou&s;e, Parella, Malabar Hill, where was my ma&s;ter's, Colonel Egerton's, Mr. Hun|ter's, Mr. Jervice's, and &s;ome others. It is like Shooter's Hill in Kent, but rather higher. At the one end is a Chockee, where there is always a European officer, having the command, on guard. When any &s;hips ap|pear in &s;ight, a &s;ignal is made to the ca&s;tle at Bombay.</P>
<P>About a mile from the guard-room is a village of the Gentoos, where is a pagoda and a grove. The hill is mo&s;tly covered with large trees, and is hardly known by the Eu|ropeans, except a few that live in the i&s;land.
<PB N="256" REF="270">
Here the Gentoos go through all the forms of their religion without interruption; and their gods are to be &s;een in proper form, as I mentioned of Darrygan. And all the Gen|toos, when they die, are burned on the i&s;land of Bombay, next day, by the &s;ea &s;ide; and the a&s;hes of the body are ca&s;t into the &s;ea. When a hu&s;band dies, his wife is &s;ome|times burned, by her own con&s;ent and choice, with the dead hu&s;band. If he has two wives, the fir&s;t has a right to burn; and if &s;he does not like it, the &s;econd ac|quires it. Sometimes if the fir&s;t wife has no children, and the &s;econd has children by her hu&s;band, the fir&s;t wife gives the right of be|ing burned up to the &s;econd. If the mo|ther does not burn with her hu&s;band, her children live in di&s;grace. They are as glad to burn, as two women in England would be to get an e&s;tate; for they think that they go to Heaven directly when they burn with their hu&s;bands. But the&s;e ob&s;ervations are confined to people of the fir&s;t rank.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="271">
When a woman has been married for years, and has had no children, and the hu&s;|band is de&s;irous to have an heir, the prie&s;ts a&s;k her hu&s;band if he will let her come and live in the holy place, among&s;t their pagods, for one month or &s;ix weeks, to try whether, by her own fa&s;ting, and their prayers, they can prevail with their Creator that &s;he may have a child. If he lets her come, &s;he is taken good care of by the prie&s;ts; and, as her hu&s;band, who never &s;ees her all the while, waits an an&s;wer at the end of the time mentioned, if &s;he tells the prie&s;ts that &s;he is with child, he is de&s;ired to come into an apartment in the pagoda, where is one of their gods cut out of &s;tone, the back to|wards the wall, and the head of pumice &s;tone, hollow, with a pipe to convey water from the prie&s;t's room; he is to put a fine hand|kerchief on the head of the idol, and conti|nue there one hour, and then to take off his handkerchief; if he finds it wet, it is an an&s;wer that he is to have a child. A Gen|too
<PB N="258" REF="272">
is only allowed two wives, but as many women as he can maintain. When a wife dies, he does not burn, but marries another. The manner of the women burning them|&s;elves with their dead hu&s;bands is as follows: A large pile of dry wood is made, and an arbour round it. The woman is dre&s;&s;ed in her be&s;t cloaths and jewels. Her relations and friends walk about the place conver&s;ing; and num|bers come to &s;ee the ceremony. At la&s;t &s;he lays a&s;ide her jewels, and gives them her fa|mily; &s;he takes leave of her children, and of all her friends, and is &s;eated on the pile, having the body of her hu&s;band laid on her lap. She &s;peaks to him for &s;ome time in a low voice; &s;he then drinks a &s;trong Nar|cotic potion, lights the wood, and the door is fixed. The mu&s;ic &s;ounds, and the drums make a great noi&s;e, and drown her cries. After all is reduced to a&s;hes, the &s;pectators depart like people in England from a funeral. I &s;aid to my&s;elf, Why &s;hould I think this woman has done wrong? She
<PB N="259" REF="273">
has done this to obtain heaven, and God's favour; and have not the great and mo&s;t learned men in England and other Chri&s;tian countries done the &s;ame to gain heaven and God's favour, who had the Bible to direct them? The Hindoos or Gentoos have no Sundays, but many holidays; nor any people in the world but Chri&s;tians and Jews. I &s;hall &s;ay very little of the Mahomedans; they are directed by their Alcoran, as we are by our Bible, and they bury in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now give a little account of the Per&s;ian wor&s;hip of fire in Bombay. About half a mile from the Gentoos pagoda, on the highe&s;t part of Malabar Hill, &s;tands the Per|&s;ian burying place, a large round tower, built of &s;tone and lime, with an iron door. Dogs are kept to give the alarm. No per&s;on but the prie&s;ts is allowed admittance. The fire burns in their church night and day; and if their hou&s;e were on fire, they would not ex|tingui&s;h
<PB N="260" REF="274">
it, but run for the Engli&s;h. The Per&s;ians addre&s;s the fire, when they cook their victuals; they will not even breathe on the fire, but put a cloth over their mouths; and you cannot di&s;oblige them more than by throwing water on the fire. They will not blow out a candle with their breath, but they will with the wind of their hands. When I lived with Colonel Dow, the Per|&s;ian &s;ervant, when he went to bed at the hot-wells, brought the candle for me to put out. When we walked together, I have &s;topt till they prayed to the &s;un in the ea&s;t. When their women are in labour, a per&s;on in the next room could not hear them, nor &s;u&s;pect their &s;ituation. They bring forth their children on the bed&s;tead, with nothing el&s;e under them. Their manner of burying is this: they follow the corp&s;e to Malabar Hill, four miles di&s;tant, all fa&s;tened one to another, and dre&s;&s;ed in white. If one of them breaks wind, and the others &s;mell the
<PB N="261" REF="275">
&s;tink, the man is obliged to &s;it down on that place of the road, and never &s;tir till the com|pany return from the burying-place; nor mu&s;t he pray till they return. When they come to the burying-place, the dead is taken in naked at the iron door. After they have gone through their prayers, they call in a dog to &s;mell the corp&s;e. If the dog wag his tail, and &s;eem plea&s;ed, the company lay the dead per&s;on on his back, with his face towards the &s;un; for they think he was a good man. But if the dog drop his tail, and turn away afraid, they think he has been a wicked man, and &s;o they throw him down among&s;t the bones headlong, and re|turn home. The birds of prey, which are always lurking near a Per&s;ian burying-place, hover and prey upon the carca&s;e.</P>
<P>Now I return to my ma&s;ter. When he was at the hot-wells, he had &s;ome enemies in the Council, who taking advantage of his ab&s;ence, examined his work at Bombay, and
<PB N="262" REF="276">
made a wrong report to the Governor. The Colonel was di&s;plea&s;ed, and the di&s;pute ran very high; and he in&s;i&s;ted on returning to London, and laying his complaint before the Directors of the Honourable Ea&s;t-India Company. This, in a great mea&s;ure, hurt his temper, and he was preparing to go with the fir&s;t &s;hip for England. One morning, when I was dre&s;&s;ing him at the country|hou&s;e, he &s;aid, John, whether would you ra|ther go to England with me, or remain in Bombay? I freely an&s;wered, Sir, I will go to any part of the world with you. Very well. Then you mu&s;t come to the hou&s;e in town, and take care of my things; for when the black &s;ervants hear I am going, they will begin to &s;teal from me. Sir, I will come, and take great care. So I took my leave of Ro&s;illa, and Randal Lodge, and came to town. Next morning General Wedderburne, the Commander in Chief, &s;ent for our coachman, Thomas Smith, to
<PB N="263" REF="277">
live with him. He was an Engli&s;hman, and the only white coachman in the i&s;land; he was a drum-major, &s;o the General had a right to command him; which made the Colonel very angry. Soon after this, my ma&s;ter de&s;ired to &s;ee his cloaths, and he put them in different lots. When he had put them properly together, he called me, and &s;aid, John, pack up the&s;e cloaths for me to to wear in Europe; and tho&s;e others I &s;hall give to &s;uch and &s;uch per&s;ons, and a few things that lie on the floor, of very little value, you may take them. Sir, replied I, if I remember right, you &s;aid I &s;hould have your old cloaths; I did not think you would u&s;e me like a boy. So you don't chu&s;e to take tho&s;e things? Yes, Sir, I will. I &s;ee, John, you and I will not agree together, &s;o provide your&s;elf. Sir, I replied, I thought I might &s;peak what I have &s;aid. I &s;ee we cannot, John, &s;o provide your&s;elf with a ma&s;ter, and you &s;hall go this day. I &s;aid, Very well, Sir.
<PB N="264" REF="278">
He de&s;ired me to make out my bill, and he di&s;charged me before dinner. The black men were extremely &s;orry to &s;ee me turned off. Bapu &s;aid, Is it po&s;&s;ible, Mr. John, you are going away? Captain Macneal &s;aid, John, where are you going? Sir, I am going to &s;eek a place for my&s;elf. So I left the Co|lonel in 1772, after living with him fifteen months as well as a king; and during that time I had as much plea&s;ure as ever a man had.</P>
<P>So I went to lodge in the hou&s;e of a &s;er|jeant, who had married a black woman. In one week I was &s;ent for by Mr. Shaw, a Gentleman of the Council, and a great enemy of the Colonel's. I was hired at the town-hou&s;e, and went to the country-hou&s;e at Omercurry, a mile from town. Here was a great &s;hew; but I had my liquor &s;erved me out by a Gentoo purvow. Then I thought of the dream I had the night be|fore
<PB N="265" REF="279">
I left the Colonel. I dreamed I fell out of my bed over a high rock, and could not get up till I went round a large mountain. Here was a large family of &s;ervants in the kitchen, two Portugueze cooks, and five &s;lave boys; but none of the &s;ervants had any liquor but my&s;elf, and that was very little. I drank nothing but arrack, and what I wanted I bought for my&s;elf. Mr. Shaw had a public night every week, with a &s;upper; and very often on that night a ball, be&s;ides dinners to his friends who came on bu&s;ine&s;s. I was confined at Omercurry with the fever and ague every three days. I went to Dr. Tennant for the bark. He told me I had got the Colonel's di&s;order, and the be&s;t I could do would be to go to Europe. I waited to &s;ee if I could get better, but rather grew wor&s;e; and I had a great de&s;ire to go to England. There was only one Captain, a Mr. Rice, to &s;ail. I went one morning to call for him, to know if he would give me
<PB N="266" REF="280">
my pa&s;&s;age to England. The Colonel came out of the dining-room fir&s;t into the veran|dah, and &s;aid, Well, John, are you tired of your new place already? No, Sir, but I am taken with the fever and ague, and I want to go home. I took no further notice of the Colonel. When Captain Rice &s;aw that, he came out, and I made a bow to him, with my hat in my hand. Sir, I am come to de|&s;ire the favour that you would let me have my pa&s;&s;age to England, as I am taken with the ague, and I will pay what you de&s;ire. He told me he had not room, if I were to give him an hundred guineas. You mu&s;t wait till the fir&s;t &s;hip that &s;ails after me. When I came down &s;tairs, Sheek and Baba &s;aid, Ma&s;ter John, you have done wrong; if you had paid the compliment to the Colonel, and de&s;ired him to have &s;poke to Captain Rice for you, he would have got your pa&s;|&s;age; but they find you bear anger. I &s;aid, I am &s;orry. I have neither craft nor cunning
<PB N="267" REF="281">
to di&s;&s;emble. I went home, and remained till another opportunity. I had no work to do but to order. In the hou&s;e was one Ru&s;|tam, a Per&s;ian, who had been &s;teward many years, and was very rich. He was above wait|ing at table. He bought every thing; and when I wanted any thing, I told him, and he &s;ent his &s;ervant; for he kept one for him|&s;elf, and paid his wages. Mr. Shaw would &s;ooner lay out a guinea for any thing, than he would five &s;hillings for liquor; &s;o Ru&s;tam bought for the table, and I made the bill of fare. The Moormen &s;aid, Mr. John, we like you, becau&s;e God has given you a temper like a girl; and we can do every thing that we &s;ee you do, except to order a dinner, or large &s;upper. We &s;ee in Bombay, that every thing is formed in your head before it is dre&s;&s;ed, and where to put every man to his place. About two fields from Omercurry was Sally Percivall's coun|try-hou&s;e. She took a walk &s;ometimes to &s;ee
<PB N="268" REF="282">
me. When &s;he wanted a letter wrote to any di&s;tance, &s;he employed me. She was very fond of walking to our hou&s;e, with her &s;on in her hand. Omercurry was very plea|&s;ant: there were a great many large trees about the hou&s;e, and fine gardens. My ma&s;ter was generally in town all day, except when he had company. When I went to write a letter for Sally Percival, I always dined with her; and the time was &s;omewhat plea&s;ant. Except when the fit of the ague and fever came on, I was pretty well. When &s;he called for me, if I was not at home, &s;he de&s;ired them to let Mr. Shaw's writer know &s;he wanted to &s;peak to him. She was a good-natured and a good-tempered woman as ever lived, and had not the lea&s;t pride, though &s;he was worth upwards of four thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling. Sometimes &s;he con|ver&s;ed with me about girls who had been in keeping by gentlemen. She &s;aid, Mr. John there are two roads, a good and an evil one. If
<PB N="269" REF="283">
I &s;hould &s;tep into the good one, I &s;hould like to remain there. I &s;aid, What you &s;ay, is right, Mrs. Percival, and upon my word, Madam, I believe, if you were married, you would make as good a wife as any in A&s;ia, and if I was good enough for you, I would propo&s;e my&s;elf for your hu&s;band. O, do not &s;ay it, Mr. John, you are very good: if I like a man, if he had not one rupee, I would &s;ooner have him than one with two thou&s;and rupees, with a deceitful heart. All the gentlemen here &s;peak very well of you, Mr. John.</P>
<P>Before the Colonel &s;ailed, my ma&s;ter had &s;aid &s;ome words di&s;re&s;pectful of him, and the Colonel &s;ent him a challenge. As my ma&s;ter was one of the Council, he made a report thereof to the Governor, and the Colonel was put under an arre&s;t, and confined &s;or &s;ome weeks. Captain Rice wanted to &s;ail, as he had got his di&s;patches. One night after, my ma&s;ter was going to Mount, where Governor Hornby lived, Mr. Shaw called me, and gave
<PB N="270" REF="284">
me a loaded pi&s;tol and a hanger, and he took the other pi&s;tol and his &s;word, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"John, come along with me."</Q> When we came before the gate, my ma&s;ter &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"John, &s;top there till I go in and &s;peak to Governor Hornby."</Q> When my ma&s;ter was in the hou&s;e, one of the Aid de Camps, Captain Stuart, ju&s;t alighted from his hor&s;e. When Captain Stuart &s;aw me, it being darki&s;h, he &s;aid, is this you John? Yes, Sir. Good God! what are you doing here in this warlike manner? Sir, I am here with Mr. Shaw, my ma&s;ter. Is he with Governor Hornby? Yes, Sir. So it &s;oon got wing, and went through the whole i&s;land, that Mr. Shaw took John for fear of meetingwith Colonel Keating, and it afford|ed a laugh at many a table. Be ready, John, that is the Colonel. Sir, I am ready, it is only a bu&s;h, Sir: but I declare I thought the Colonel was before us. Are you &s;ure, John, your pi&s;tols are primed and flints good? Yes, Sir.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="285">
Captain Rice &s;ailed, and Colonel Keating with him. I remained till Captain Thomas Taylor of the Hamp&s;hire Indiaman arrived. As he vi&s;ited at my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, I a&s;ked him if he would give me a pa&s;&s;age to Eng|land. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"By all means; get your&s;elf ready, and when I &s;ail for Europe, you &s;hall go along with me."</Q></P>
<P>At this time I had the third day ague. When the Hamp&s;hire laid at Bombay, Seedy, a &s;overeign Prince (whom I mentioned be|fore) came to negociate bu&s;ine&s;s with the Governor and Council. He had a hou&s;e made ready for him, and plenty of provi&s;ion for him&s;elf and all his train. When he had tran&s;acted his bu&s;ine&s;s, he vi&s;ited all the principal men in Bombay, and wherever he came, he drank &s;ome coffee made by one of his own ca&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="286">
Soon after Seedy, the Prince, went away, the Nabob of Broach came on bu&s;ine&s;s with the Governor and Council; he had four hun|dred and fifty men in his train. The hou&s;e al|lotted for the Nabob was joining my ma&s;|ter's town-hou&s;e, and his tents were pitched before our hou&s;e, and Governor Hornby allowed the Nabob's &s;tandard to be &s;et up at the head of his little camp. He continued at Bombay for three weeks: his attendants were very richly dre&s;&s;ed: he had two bands of mu|&s;ic, which played all the night when he was a&s;leep, the one relieved the other.</P>
<P>When his affairs were &s;ettled, the Nabob vi&s;ited the Governor and all the Council at their hou&s;es, and General Wedderburne at his country hou&s;e, where he went on a vi&s;it. He had two hundred men to attend him, mo&s;tly in arms, with colours flying.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="287">
When he came to &s;ee my ma&s;ter at Omer|curry, he entered our parlour, &s;at down with our ma&s;ter, and conver&s;ed. All his principal &s;ervants entered and &s;tood round the whole time, and I behind my ma&s;ter's chair.</P>
<P>It is thought a grand thing in A&s;ia to have an European &s;ervant. As the Nabob was a Mahomedan, our two &s;ervants, of his ca&s;t, &s;erved him with coffee, and the ro&s;e water &s;prinkled on the parlour. This was all the entertainment he had, where he vi&s;ited. He ate at home, and his victuals were dre&s;&s;ed by his own cook.</P>
<P>The Hamp&s;hire only waited for a fair wind. The pa&s;&s;engers were all ordered on board. I took my leave of Bombay, and went on board, and then the ague and fever left me. I waited at the Captain's table, as there were a good many pa&s;&s;engers, and I me&s;&s;ed
<PB N="272" REF="288">
with the Captain's &s;ervants. I got better every day.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t place we &s;topped at was Tilli|cherry. Mr. Boddam was Chief at that time. We &s;topped ten days to take in pepper and other goods. The Captain took me on &s;hore with his own &s;ervant, James Clerke, who was a fine &s;inger, and we enjoyed our&s;elves every night at an Engli&s;hman's, who kept a public hou&s;e in Tillicherry. It is one of the plea&s;ante&s;t places I ever &s;aw. We next &s;top|ped at Cuchiline, which belongs to the Dutch: we &s;topped here two nights to buy provi&s;ions, which were in plenty and cheap.</P>
<P>When we were a month out from Bom|bay, we &s;topped at Anjengoe, a place of our own, to compleat our loading. We were here a week: fowls &s;old here at the rate of eight for a rupee, and pine apples at one
<PB N="273" REF="289">
penny each, and every thing el&s;e in propor|tion. When an Engli&s;h &s;oldier goes on guard, he takes two bottles of arrack to drink in the night.</P>
<P>When the Honourable Company's goods were all on board, and the &s;hip ready to &s;ail, the wind blew very &s;trong, the &s;ea was very rough, and the Captain was afraid of a lee|&s;hore. The Captain de&s;ired his &s;ervant and me to go on board, and take the other gentlemen's &s;ervants with us. We carried the Captain's and the other pa&s;&s;engers' linens. Anjengoe was the la&s;t port we were to touch at in India. The Hamp&s;hire was two miles from &s;hore at anchor. The Captain came to the beach to &s;ee us go over the highe&s;t &s;urf, the highe&s;t in A&s;ia, except Madra&s;s. We got over the fir&s;t and &s;econd, but the third was about twelve feet high. It blew &s;o &s;trong, that it threw our boat and all of us into the &s;ea, and with
<PB N="274" REF="290">
a great &s;truggle we &s;aved our lives and the articles we had.</P>
<P>After dinner, we were &s;ent back. Mr. Reinek the Chief came down to the beach to &s;ee the coolies do their duty in taking us off. At this time all the things were wet, and of cour&s;e more heavy; we got over the fir&s;t and &s;econd as before, but the third over|threw us all together. The linens being wet, went to the bottom. The next &s;urf knocked the coolie boat upon James Clerke, the Cap|tain's &s;ervant, and broke his thigh.</P>
<P>We had a hard &s;truggle for our lives. We came back to Mr. Reinek's hou&s;e, and &s;topped till next morning. It being calmer, we got ea&s;y off; the things were all lo&s;t. James Clerke was left behind, and when we got on board I took his place. We had a good pa&s;&s;age for England, till we came between the latitude of the &s;outh part of Madaga&s;car and the
<PB N="275" REF="291">
Cape of Good Hope. There we had tempe&s;|tuous weather for three weeks, with a foul wind, &s;o that the Captain furled the &s;ails and la&s;hed up the helm, and let the &s;hip drive where &s;he would.</P>
<P>Captain Taylor and his officers were in great trouble of mind. We got &s;o near the Cape, with a lee &s;hore, that we could &s;ee the table land, and the Lyon's Rump, and had the wind continued, we &s;hould have da&s;hed again&s;t the rocks; but it plea&s;ed God the wind chang|ed, and carried us further on the &s;ea. We had very bad weather going round the Cape of Good Hope, in&s;omuch that the whole &s;hip's company expected every day to be lo&s;t. Sometimes the officers on watch were knock|ed down on deck by a &s;ea coming overboard, and the men were wa&s;hed overboard, and never &s;een again. One time two men were wa&s;hed over, and the next &s;ea threw them in again. One of our be&s;t &s;eamen was ea&s;ing him&s;elf on the head, and a &s;ea wa&s;hed him
<PB N="276" REF="292">
away. He called out, A rope, a rope, Captain; but he di&s;appeared, and was never &s;een afterwards.</P>
<P>The weather was &s;o &s;tormy, that the &s;ailors &s;aid they &s;aw the flying Dutchman. The com|mon &s;tory is, that this Dutchman came to the Cape in di&s;tre&s;s of weather, and wanted to get into harbour, but could not get a pilot to conduct her, and was lo&s;t; and that ever &s;ince, in very bad weather, her vi&s;ion ap|pears. The &s;ailors fancy that if you would hail her, &s;he would an&s;wer like another ve&s;|&s;el. At length we got into the trade winds, and had fine weather, &s;o that we hardly &s;hifted a &s;ail for two weeks, when the &s;hip's company had ea&s;e after hard work. We came down with plea&s;ure to St. Helena, and &s;topped ten days. On &s;hore I was acting|&s;teward, and Captain Taylor's, &s;ervant. As they dine early at St. Helena, we walked every day after dinner up the country among&s;t
<PB N="277" REF="293">
the white farmers. As the country is very high, we could &s;ee a great way at &s;ea; and up the country we &s;aw a great many white girls, farmers daughters.</P>
<P>St. Helena is a whole&s;ome plea&s;ant place, and a fine keen &s;earching air. If noblemen and gentlemen of Great Britain and Ireland, would go to Madeira and St. Helena for their health, in&s;tead of going to France and Por|tugal, they would be &s;ure to re-e&s;tabli&s;h their health.</P>
<P>When Captain Taylor had &s;topped as long as he wi&s;hed for, and had got provi&s;ions and water on board, he &s;et &s;ail for the i&s;land of A&s;cen&s;ion, &s;ixteen degrees north from St. Helena. The Captain &s;topped two days to get fi&s;h and turtle for the &s;hip's company, which are got there in plenty. No per&s;on lives on the i&s;land, becau&s;e there is neither water, rain, nor &s;pring. The i&s;land has no gra&s;s all the
<PB N="278" REF="294">
year round. It is thirty miles round, and has very high mountains; but where the &s;hips come to anchor it is level, and the &s;and on the beach is as white as &s;now. When an officer and his men go on &s;hore to catch turtle, the men run and turn them on their back, while they are a&s;leep at night on the beach. While they la&s;t, the whole &s;hip's company have turtle to eat, and &s;ometimes one &s;hip will catch forty or fifty large ones. From A&s;cen&s;ion we &s;et &s;ail, and the fir&s;t place we &s;topped at was Port&s;|mouth, where we were a few days; and again we &s;et &s;ail, and arrived at Blackwall, after a pa&s;|&s;age of above &s;ix months, and I had been gone from England four years. I &s;topped with Capt. Taylor one month, till the &s;hip was unloaded.</P>
<P>I was out of place three months. I hired my&s;elf to James Nowland, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in Newman-&s;treet, Oxford-&s;treet. This gentle|man gave Mr. Shaw my character in the i&s;land of Bombay. When I left Colonel Keat|ing I lived with him &s;ix months. One Sun|day,
<PB N="279" REF="295">
in particular, when he had company, after dinner he called for a pack of cards, and there happened to be none in the hou&s;e, and I could get none to buy. He rung the bell in anger, and becau&s;e I could not get him cards to play, he turned me away. Next ma&s;ter I had, was Mr. Lecall, a Dutchman, who lodged in Pall-Mall Court. His Dutch &s;er|vant had returned, and as I was acquainted at the hou&s;e, I called there. By chance the mi&s;|tre&s;s went up &s;tairs and &s;poke about me, and as the people of the hou&s;e knew me, he took me without a character. I lived with him three months. Every Monday morning he gave me fifteen &s;hillings per week, and I had plenty of every thing be&s;ide that I wanted. He had his dinners from the Star and Garter. He was as good a ma&s;ter as ever I met with. If he did not come home by twelve at night, I was to go to bed; and he came home to break|fa&s;t. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"John, I am under the nece&s;|&s;ity of going to Paris before I return to Am&s;terdam: you had better go with me and
<PB N="280" REF="296">
I &s;hall not have to hire a &s;ervant in Paris, as you know the city of Paris."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir, I will go round Cape Horn with you, if you plea&s;e."</Q> So he allowed me one &s;hilling per day more for travelling. We &s;et out for Dover in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and cro&s;&s;ed over to Calais, and in the &s;ame manner &s;et off po&s;t for Paris. We put up at Mon&s;ieur Semunnilie's Hotel de Park Royal, Rue Fauxbourg, St. Germaine, at the apartments Mr. Crauford had when I was with him in Paris. He found he mu&s;t have a carriage, as there are not chairs as in London. I went to the &s;ame livery &s;tables that furni&s;hed Mr. Crauford with a chai&s;e and hor&s;es, and I de&s;ired a carriage to attend my ma&s;ter; when he &s;aid, John, if you do not like to go out with the chariot, get a lackey's place. I told him I would go out with the carriage with all my heart, and &s;ave him that expence; and by going out with the chariot, I had one livre per day from the ma&s;ter of the chariot and hor&s;es, as is the cu&s;tom in Paris.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="297">
We were three months in Paris, which made ninety livres; for my ma&s;ter jaunted about Pa|ris and went to Ver&s;ailles. Louis the XV. was there at that time. It is a fine place; much like Wind&s;or; and the gardens are very large. I went to the King's fine chapel on Sunday. The King, the Dauphin, and Dauphine&s;s were in the gallery, at the one end of the chapel. We &s;topped here one week.</P>
<P>I can hardly expre&s;s the plea&s;ure I had with Mr. Lecall. When his bu&s;ine&s;s was done, we went po&s;t to Li&s;le in Flanders, and we were there two days. From thence we went to Ypres, a city belonging to the Dutch. At this place his coachman came with his chariot and hor&s;es, and &s;topped here one day to re&s;t the hor&s;es. The coachman could not &s;peak French nor Engli&s;h, and I could &s;peak no Dutch; but we &s;pent the evening agreeably together. The landlord was interpreter be|tween us. My ma&s;ter paid me, and went home; and next day I &s;et off, and in two days
<PB N="282" REF="298">
arrived at Calais, and cro&s;&s;ed over to Dover. After my arrival in London, I &s;oon got another ma&s;ter to go abroad with, Mr. Daw|&s;on from Dublin. We &s;et off for the Ger|man Spa, through Flanders. My ma&s;ter had a great liking for this country. The people were ju&s;t after his own heart; for he had a great de&s;ire for gambling, and that is the de|light of foreigners. My ma&s;ter was gone from England one year, and in that he gain|ed one thou&s;and pounds; what he lo&s;t and gained, he marked down in a book. One night at Li&s;tle, coming home, he told me, <Q REND="inline">"John, I have ju&s;t gained one thou&s;and pounds."</Q> Sir, I am very glad; for that will clear your ex|pences. Very nearly, &s;aid he. My ma&s;ter and a Mr. Stuart from Holland, a Scotch gentle|man, kept hou&s;e together at Spa, while he &s;topped at Spa. In &s;ix weeks Mr. Stuart went home. My ma&s;ter then got Colonel O'Fagan, in the Emperor's &s;ervice, to be in the hou&s;e with him. He had a German valet and footman. My ma&s;ter went very often to
<PB N="283" REF="299">
Aix la Chapelle. At the hotel of Madam Buchie, there were always a great many ladies and gentlemen. She had a daughter married to a gentleman in Liege, and a pretty girl at home unmarried. Madam Buchie had her coachman and footman in livery, and &s;o had her &s;on-in-law, which made her hou&s;e more re&s;pected by the ladies and gentlemen.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter was in this country five months, in Aix la Chapelle, Spa, Liege, and Bru&s;&s;els, then in the winter at Paris, where we put up at the Hotel de Saxe, Rue Fauxbourg, St. Germaine. My ma&s;ter got a carriage, coachman, and footman, and he gave a rich livery, and made as genteel appearance as any in Paris. He went to Ver&s;ailles, and as far as Bourdeaux, where he had relations in the wine trade, and there we were &s;ix weeks, and then came to London by &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="300">
After being in London a few weeks, we went to Holyhead, in Wales, and to Dublin in the packet. Mr. Daw&s;on's hou&s;e was in the Mall. He had a large family of &s;ervants. I &s;topped two weeks at his hou&s;e; then he got me a ma&s;ter, one Mr. Brown, who was going to London on bu&s;ine&s;s. I hired my&s;elf with him two months. He lodged in the Hay|market, at the Seven Stars, a milliner's. He left London. Mr. Brown and another gentle|man took a po&s;t-chai&s;e for Park-Gate. I was then out of place. Soon after I heard of a gen|tleman wanting a &s;ervant to go into Wales. Mr. Bate, at his hotel in the Adelphi, told me to go to Mr. Freeman in the Temple. When I &s;aw him, he &s;aid, Did Mr. Bate &s;end you to me? Yes, Sir. I want a &s;ervant to go with me, as it is the vacation, and the com|pany is out of town, to dre&s;s me, and go round the we&s;t of England; and I want to &s;ee Wales. My &s;ervant is of no u&s;e to travel, as he cannot dre&s;s hair; &s;o we &s;et out in two
<PB N="285" REF="301">
days for Oxford, Cheltenham, Worce&s;ter, and Glouce&s;ter, and Malvern Wells. He was well plea&s;ed with the journey, and liked the pro|&s;pect and &s;ituation of the hou&s;e at the Wells much.</P>
<P>When we left Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, going over Malvern Hills, my ma&s;ter, as being before, &s;aw a long bundle on the road. He &s;aid, John, take up that bundle, and &s;ee what is in it. I got off my hor&s;e and opened the bundle, and found two new &s;hifts, a gown, two pair of &s;heets, and two pair of &s;tockings. It is your property Sir, as you &s;aw it fir&s;t. My ma&s;ter &s;aid, John, lay the bundle on the &s;tone, or hang it on that tree, and whoever has lo&s;t it will find it when they come to look for it. I &s;aid, Sir, I beg your pardon, but I had ra|ther not, but take it along with me, for ano|ther per&s;on may take it, who&s;e property it is not. Sir, I beg you will let me take it. So we went on, and by and by a boy came running
<PB N="286" REF="302">
along, and &s;aid, Gentlemen, did you &s;ee a bun|dle, we dropped it from the waggon as we came from Glouce&s;ter city. My ma&s;ter &s;aid, Who does the bundle belong to? Plea&s;e your honour, it belongs to my young mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he went with the waggon to buy the things that are in the bundle. She is going to be mar|ried next week. What is her name? Sir, her name is Molly Williams, &s;he is farmer William's daughter; &s;he is to be married to young Bob Giles, the cooper. My ma&s;ter &s;aid, my &s;ervant has got the bundle, and when we overtake the waggon, &s;he &s;hall have it. When we came along-&s;ide of the wag|gon, my ma&s;ter &s;aid, My dear, I have found your bundle, I hear you are to be married. Yes, Sir. Take care of your bundle, otherwi&s;e it may not fall into &s;o good hands again. Sir, I am very much obliged to you. I have one thing to tell you, my dear, take great care of your maidenhead, and if you &s;hould lo&s;e
<PB N="287" REF="303">
it, if you do not cry O, you will never get it again.</P>
<P>We went to Ro&s;s, Hereford, Monmouth, Chep&s;tow, Abergaveny, and back to Chep|&s;tow again. My ma&s;ter admired this place much. He &s;aid it was as &s;weet a rural place as ever he &s;aw: he &s;topped two days at the Three Cranes: he de&s;ired me to have what punch I liked to drink in the evening with the farmers, which was the cau&s;e of a good deal of money being &s;pent, and the landlord was &s;orry when we came away. We cro&s;&s;ed the Old Ferry, and came to Bri&s;tol; and next day we came to Bath, and &s;topped; and at the end of eight weeks from London he return|ed, after a plea&s;ant journey. I left him, and as I was coming along Coventry-&s;treet, I met one of Mr. Maines's clerks, the Banker in Jermyn-&s;treet. He a&s;ked, if I was in place? I &s;aid, Sir, I have ju&s;t left one. John, go to Mr. Hill's, who lodges in Pall-Mall,
<PB N="288" REF="304">
at No. 23. He comes out of York&s;hire, and is going to France. He gets money at our hou&s;e, when he wants; tell him you came from our hou&s;e. Accordingly I went next morning; and being very well dre&s;&s;ed, with a gold laced ve&s;t, and other things in form, I went up &s;tairs. He a&s;ked me &s;everal que&s;tions; &s;uch as, Did you go with the&s;e gentlemen as a &s;ervant, or as a companion? I am a &s;ervant, Sir, and not a proud one, I do a&s;&s;ure you. Very well; give me your addre&s;s, and, if I want you, I will &s;end for you. As I was coming out, I met a German going up. I went into the next publick hou&s;e, and &s;oon after this man came in. I a&s;ked him if he had &s;ucce&s;s, he &s;aid he had, and was to go to France with him. He &s;poke to me about you; and &s;aid you were more like a gentleman than a &s;er|vant; now, I am plain dre&s;&s;ed, and I have got the place. Three days after I went after Sir Francis Hobburn's place. I was dre&s;&s;ed plain, without lace. I went up &s;tairs to him. He
<PB N="289" REF="305">
was going on his travels. When he &s;aw me, he &s;aid, he had got one. When I came down &s;tairs he rung the bell, and &s;aid to his foot|man, how came you to &s;end that fellow to me? Is he dre&s;&s;ed like a per&s;on for my place, or like an interpreter? When he came down, he &s;aid, I am &s;orry I did not tell you to dre&s;s your&s;elf finer, for Sir Francis is very nice. After this I was &s;ent to Sir William Abdy's place. I went at night, and well dre&s;&s;ed. Sir William not being at home, Lady Abdy told me, &s;he did not want a &s;ervant. Three days after I &s;aw the &s;ervant that &s;ent me after the place, who &s;aid, I am &s;orry you went dre&s;&s;ed in a gold laced wai&s;tcoat. Again&s;t the candle light, it made a more rich appearance. She &s;aid you were too grand for a family &s;ervant. I &s;aid to my&s;elf, a man does not know what to do for the be&s;t in this world. The next ma&s;ter I had, I got in an odd manner, in Brewer|&s;treet, Golden-&s;quare. I met an acquaintance of my own, who told me he had been after
<PB N="290" REF="306">
a place. A young gentleman, at Mr. Gor|don's, an undertaker's hou&s;e, was come to London for his health, and the advice of the doctors. I a&s;ked a guinea per week, and he would not give it; if you like, you may go and &s;ee what he will give you. I told him I would, and bid him go into the publick hou&s;e till I came back. I knew that a young gen|tleman from the country, not accu&s;tomed to keep a &s;ervant, would not give that money. I called for Mr. Lowrie at Mr. Gordon's, and I was &s;ent up to his room. Sir, I believe you want a &s;ervant. I do. After a&s;king &s;ome que&s;tions, and he was plea&s;ed with the an|&s;wers, he &s;aid, What &s;hall I give you per week? Fifteen &s;hillings, Sir, if you plea&s;e. I will give you that, &s;o come in the morn|ing, and there is half a crown to drink. I thanked him, and promi&s;ed to be with him in the morning. I went to my friend and told him what had happened, and treated him with half a crown's worth of liquor. He
<PB N="291" REF="307">
was like to hang him&s;elf, for not taking Mr. Lowrie's kind offer. Dr. Smith, a relation of his, attended my ma&s;ter. I lived with him near half a year. The doctor was very well plea&s;ed with my attention to my ma&s;ter; I was his nur&s;e and cook, and made all his drinks; it was a good place for me, as ever a man could wi&s;h to enjoy. I had &s;everal pre&s;ents for my attention.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter got well and went into Scot|land; then I was out of place &s;ome months, and lived on the fruits of my labour: that was my cu&s;tom; when in place I was careful, and out of place I went genteel, and was &s;o|ber, and was ready in three hours to go any where in the world. Next place I had was to live with George Spencer, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Norfolk-&s;treet, in the Strand. I hired my&s;elf to him for forty guineas per year; he was a Madeira merchant and had his partners in Madeira. He commonly lived in Norfolk-&s;treet; but he went
<PB N="292" REF="308">
into the country through the we&s;t of England, and he &s;topped in Bath and Bri&s;tol weeks at a time: he was mo&s;tly on the move; he de|lighted in travelling. When on the road, he never had a bottle of wine but I had part of it. He went to &s;ee his friends in Dublin, the Madeira merchants; and it was the only place in the world I liked to go to. I &s;aw my old acquaintance; I gave a ball to all my friends, at a publick hou&s;e in Capel-&s;treet, to upwards of forty people. That it might be no trouble to the landlord, I had one ham baked, and three turkies cold put into a &s;ide|room to eat when they liked. I gave punch, wine, and negus, and whatever the hou&s;e af|forded. The company were all gone by two in the morning, being mo&s;tly gentlemen's &s;ervants, men, and maids. When they were gone, I drank a bottle of wine with the land|lord. I had liberty the whole night. I paid my bill, four pound ten &s;hillings; the mu&s;ick fifteen &s;hillings, and five &s;hillings to the two
<PB N="293" REF="309">
&s;ervants for their trouble; in all five pounds ten &s;hillings. There was neither gla&s;s nor plate broke, the company behaved &s;o well. At this time I was called the <HI>hand&s;ome Macdonald.</HI> If I called for any per&s;on, if they were out, the maid would tell, when her fellow-&s;ervant came home, Mr. Macdonald called. Which Mr. Macdonald? for in Dublin there are a great many of that name; the maids would &s;ay, it was the <HI>hand&s;ome Macdonald,</HI> that gave the ball. In London, I was called <HI>Beau Mac|donald</HI> by the men, and the <HI>Scotch Frenchman.</HI></P>
<P>We had great plea&s;ure in this jaunt to Ireland. My ma&s;ter went fir&s;t to the city of Corke to &s;ettle his bills with the wine merchants, and then returned to Dublin, and afterwards to Belfa&s;t in the north of Ireland. We travelled in a noddy from Dublin and back again, that is, a one hor&s;e chai&s;e, and the driver &s;its behind the hor&s;e, &s;o the hor&s;e draws three people. On
<PB N="294" REF="310">
the north road I could give my ma&s;ter a de|&s;cription of the country, as I had been there before. We returned to Dublin, and then through Wales to London. I lived with my ma&s;ter one year. One day in particular my ma&s;ter dined out, and I waited on him, and at night we both came home merry; when I put his hair in papers, and undre&s;&s;ed him, I took up his &s;hoes in my left hand, and put his coat over the &s;ame arm; and &s;eeing me do &s;o, he &s;aid, You take up my cloaths as if you had never &s;een any cloaths before.&mdash;Sir, I have handled better than yours many times. He turned me out of the room, and next morning he di&s;charged me: &s;o I lo&s;t a good place for &s;peaking one fooli&s;h word, and I was very &s;orry for it.</P>
<P>In two weeks after, I was walking through St. James's Park, and I met James Macpher|&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Manche&s;ter Buildings. He a&s;ked me if I was in place. I told him I had left
<PB N="295" REF="311">
George Spencer, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> about two weeks ago, and got no ma&s;ter at pre&s;ent. He &s;aid he was going to France, and would take me along with him. Come in the morning: I &s;hall go to Dover to-morrow night, my black man will pack up my cloaths. I went in the morning, and we &s;et out in a po&s;t-chai&s;e to Dover that night, and next day cro&s;&s;ed over to Calais, and &s;lept there that night. Next day we &s;et off for Paris, and put up at the Hotel d' Angleterre, Rue Rukelow, and there my ma&s;ter was two months. He had a carriage, coachman, and footman. My ma&s;ter and &s;ome other gentlemen in company went to Ver|&s;ailles for one day. The palace is hand&s;ome, the gardens exten&s;ive, and the &s;tables the hand&s;ome&s;t I ever &s;aw in my life. At this time Louis XV. was ill of the &s;mall-pox, and died while we were in France. When my ma&s;ter left Paris, he went po&s;t to Li&s;le, af|terwards to Ypres. We &s;topped in this city one week. The three Scotch regiments lay
<PB N="296" REF="312">
here, called the Scotch Hollanders; they were commanded by Colonels Stuart, Gordon, and John&s;tone. I thought my&s;elf in Scotland, &s;eeing &s;o many of my own countrymen.</P>
<P>When we left Ypres, we went to Dun|kirk, and through Graveline to Calais, we were here two days, and then cro&s;&s;ed over to Dover, then home to London. As I was only with my ma&s;ter for the journey, I was paid next day; and again I was out of place. The next ma&s;ter I had was James Couts, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> banker, in the Strand, who was going to make the tour of England for his health. He waited one month in London before he could get a &s;ervant to dre&s;s him. He wore a wig over his hair. He had twenty &s;ervants that came, but they could not dre&s;s him. It required a per&s;on that under&s;tood the bu&s;ine&s;s of wig|making. When he was dre&s;&s;ed, no per&s;on could tell there was any thing but his own hair; and he had the hand&s;ome&s;t head and
<PB N="297" REF="313">
face I ever &s;aw in my life. He hired me; and next day we &s;et out for his country hou&s;e, at Hampton village, then for Cheltenham with our coach and four hor&s;es, and two &s;addle hor&s;es. My ma&s;ter was accompanied by his daughter, Mi&s;s Couts, and her cou&s;in Mi&s;s Stuart of Allan Bank, in Scotland. There were the coachman and po&s;tilion, the foot|boy and I. When on the road, the fir&s;t thing I did in the morning, was to knock at the ladies door to call them. At other times they got up when they plea&s;ed. At this time, there was at Cheltenham a great deal of company. My ma&s;ter lodged at a quaker's hou&s;e, the pro|prietor of the wells. We went out every day airing. It is the cu&s;tom at the wells to go out after breakfa&s;t, and after dinner. We went to Morvin Wells, and to the city of Glouce&s;ter, a night at one place, and a night at the other place, and back to Chel|tenham again. We &s;topped at Cheltenham two months, and jaunting about in this man|ner.
<PB N="298" REF="314">
Then we &s;et off for Worce&s;ter, Birming|ham, Manche&s;ter, Pre&s;ton, Matlock-wells, and called at all the noblemen and gentle|men's hou&s;es on the road, and &s;o on in this manner to Carli&s;le city. We travelled to every part worth &s;eeing in the north of Eng|land. We cro&s;&s;ed the Tweed from Cornhill to Cold&s;tream, and remained in that beauti|ful country, the &s;outh part of Scotland, two months, vi&s;iting from one family to another; but we were chiefly in the Mer&s;e, at the hou&s;e of Sir John Stuart of Allan Bank, my ma&s;ter's cou&s;in. We went to Kel&s;o, Berwick, Dun&s;e, and went over to the Holy I&s;land a few days; and we partook of &s;everal kettles of fi&s;h on the banks of the Tweed, which merry fea&s;ts are always accompanied with dancing. When we left this place, we we went to Harrowgate. From thence we went to London, and afterwards to my ma&s;|ter's hou&s;e at Hampton. After he had been at home &s;ome time, my ma&s;ter found he mu&s;t
<PB N="299" REF="315">
go &s;ome where el&s;e, and his phy&s;icians ad|vi&s;ed him to go to Italy for the air of that country, and he con&s;ented; therefore I had warning given me, as he was obliged to have an Italian &s;ervant to take my place. Mr. Ro&s;i was hired, but did not come home till my ma&s;ter was ready to go.</P>
<P>Mr. Couts was &s;o well plea&s;ed with my &s;er|vice for &s;even months, as I never was once out of the way, made of all &s;orts of drinks that was ordered for him, and whatever he wanted, that he made me &s;everal pre&s;ents of cloaths; and when he paid me my wages, he gave me two guineas over, and told Mr. Brown, the wine-merchant in Craven-&s;treet, to recommend me.</P>
<P>I went to Dover with Mr. Couts, and re|turned when he and the ladies went on board of &s;hip. I came back to London, and in two weeks Sir John Stuart of Allan Bank came to London on his way to Portugal, for the benefit of his health. I &s;uppo&s;e I had been
<PB N="300" REF="316">
recommended for his &s;ervant, when he &s;hould come to London, by Mr. Couts. He called for me at two or three places. I heard of it. I went to him at Mrs. Elliot's, in Brewer-&s;treet, where he lodged. He told me he was going to Li&s;bon for his health; that he did not think that he &s;hould live till he reached there; and if I was not engaged, he would take me with him. I told him I &s;hould be very happy to embrace the offer. He had a carriage, and &s;topped a few weeks in Lon|don, and in winter, November, 1776, we &s;et out for Sali&s;bury. Sir John was then twenty years of age: then for Dorche&s;ter, after to Exeter; there my ma&s;ter was one week wait|ing for Mr. March, a gentleman going to Li&s;bon, of his acquaintance. When Mr. March came, we went po&s;t to Falmouth, and we &s;topped there near a week till a fair wind came round. We went on board the Expe|dition Packet, Captain Robert&s;on, with a great many pa&s;&s;engers, ladies and gentlemen,
<PB N="301" REF="317">
many who had never been at &s;ea before. We &s;et &s;ail with a fair wind. The weather was fine for that time of the year, but the fine day cau&s;ed a great confu&s;ion at night. The &s;hip not being prepared for a &s;torm, the tar-pawl|ing not being over the hatchways, and other places open, a great &s;torm aro&s;e in the mid|dle of the night. When we got in the Bay of Bi&s;cay, all at once all hands were called to &s;ave the &s;ails and ma&s;ts. The hatchways being uncovered, we &s;hipped a &s;ea, which made the whole &s;hip's company think we were going to the bottom. In a moment &s;o much water came in, as &s;et the che&s;ts a float|ing. In three minutes more, we &s;hipped ano|ther, which knocked me out of my ham|mock. Then I believe we all &s;aid, God have mercy on us. I laid in one of the men's hammocks in the galley, on the lee &s;ide; of cour&s;e, on the lower &s;ide, for the &s;hip was near on her broad &s;ide before the &s;ails were lowered. The che&s;ts and trunks rolled on me;
<PB N="302" REF="318">
I could hardly get out: I crawled out with great difficulty, and went into the cuddy where the Captain and the gentlemen dined. My ma&s;ter was there in his hammock. When he &s;aw me, he &s;aid, Good God, John, I &s;up|po&s;e we &s;hall be all lo&s;t, what &s;hall I do? Mu&s;t I get up?&mdash;Sir, do you lie &s;till, there is no danger, we have got a land wind. What is a land wind? Sir, a wind that comes from the land, that will drive us out to &s;ea, and then there is no danger when we have got &s;ea-room. I &s;at and kept hold of the ma&s;t, ju&s;t be&s;ide my ma&s;ter. By this time the ladies and gentlemen were in fits. When the &s;ails and ma&s;ts were &s;aved, the hatches were cover|ed over. It rained, and the wind was wonder|fully &s;trong; but as God would have it, no lives were lo&s;t. The Captain, and mo&s;t of his &s;hip's company, had their wives and fa|milies at Falmouth, and there was &s;uch cry|ing for fear of never &s;eeing them again. One of the mariners, that had been in the trade
<PB N="305" REF="319">
for eighteen years, was frightened into fits. After the greate&s;t danger was over, the Cap|tain lay down; he got up again light headed. Sir John a&s;ked me, if I did not think it be&s;t for him to get up?&mdash;No, Sir, you are in the be&s;t place you can be; for there is not the lea&s;t danger. Do not &s;hew the lea&s;t marks of fear, and then they cannot laugh at you. The ladies have been in fits, and &s;ome of the gentlemen al&s;o. For my part, I have been in wor&s;e &s;torms than this many times; and, had the &s;hip been prepared, we &s;hould not have been &s;o ill off as we are. We waited with patience till &s;even in the morning; when I got my ma&s;ter up to clear the place for break|fa&s;t. By this time he was glad that he took my advice to lie &s;till in the night. Finding things were out of danger, my ma&s;ter went on deck, where he &s;aw &s;uch a &s;cene as he ne|ver &s;aw before; the &s;ea was very high indeed, and the wind continued; &s;o my ma&s;ter &s;tood for one hour, without &s;tirring, to &s;ee the
<PB N="306" REF="320">
raging of the &s;ea, and the mariners putting things to rights after the night's fright.</P>
<P>Mr. March and my ma&s;ter were &s;peaking about the &s;torm. He &s;aid, Sir John, this lets you know what the poor mariners go through in a hurricane, and in a battle at &s;ea. The rough weather continued, &s;o that my ma&s;ter wore one &s;hirt for ten days. Af|ter this we had fine weather, and kept our Chri&s;tmas on &s;ea, and the company was very happy; but one fine moon-light night we &s;aw a man of war making after us, full &s;ail, and put up all the &s;ail we could; but &s;he gained on us, and the Captain made the &s;hip ready to fight. The mail was brought up to be ready to throw overboard. They fired &s;ome guns after us to bring us to. Mr. Bowen, a gentleman of Falmouth, went on the poop; and I &s;tood with him. He &s;aid we were as &s;afe there as below. The man of war was &s;till gaining on us, but the Captain
<PB N="307" REF="321">
put off no time to make ready. By and by, two Portugue&s;e gentlemen came up to look how things were going on; and, that moment, a ball came acro&s;s our &s;hip's rigging. They both went down directly to the pa&s;&s;engers and told this. So you may con&s;ider our &s;itua|tion. We thought they would be all taken. Soon after, another ball came acro&s;s our fore-&s;hip; and they hailed us, and de&s;ired our Captain to lay too; and &s;o he did: and, after all, we found her to be our friend; the &s;hip was the Earl of Dunmore. The Captain of the Dunmore let our Captain know he would &s;end one of his officers on board of us to hear the news, for he had been a great while from England. By and by this officer and boat's crew came to us as bold as heroes. I &s;aid to my&s;elf, I will be damned but you have a great &s;tock of impudence to put our gentlemen and ladies in &s;uch a fear. By this time the pa&s;&s;engers were come up to the Captain's dining-place. When the Captain received
<PB N="308" REF="322">
the Lieutenant of the man of war, he en|tered &s;o bold that the ladies looked at him with fear, &s;urprize, and gladne&s;s; the &s;ame as the daughters of king Darius did at Alex|ander when he took them in their tents. He received the news; and, informed us of what he knew. He drank grog; and his men had grog to drink along-&s;ide. So they went away again, and the pa&s;&s;engers went to bed with ea&s;y minds. For two days more we had a plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age, and got in &s;ight of the rock of Li&s;bon. When we came near the entrance of the river, a poor fi&s;herman came on board and took the command of the &s;hip to pilot her into the Tagus to the an|choring-place, on the la&s;t night of the year. We all went to the Engli&s;h hotel, kept by Mr. and Mrs. Durar from Northumberland. Next morning, at breakfa&s;t, we laughed to think we had been in Li&s;bon part of two years. The hotel was large, and &s;tood on the highe&s;t ground near Li&s;bon, neare&s;t the
<PB N="309" REF="323">
&s;ea. There was a great deal of company in the hotel, Engli&s;h, Iri&s;h, Scots, Wel&s;h, gen|tlemen and &s;ervants. Some had car|riages, others hor&s;es, while they remained at Li&s;bon; and they made a fine appearance when they went together an airing. Sir John had a carriage and coachman and two &s;addle-hor&s;es. The owner of the &s;addle-hor&s;es was an Engli&s;hman, and he acted as his footman and groom. My ma&s;ter made the genteele&s;t appearance of any gentleman in Li&s;bon. As my ma&s;ter and I were going into Spain, at our departure from Li&s;bon, we both had a Spani&s;h ma&s;ter. We did not mind the Portugue&s;e language. My ma&s;ter made not any improvement in the Spani&s;h language, he was &s;o much out. But I &s;topt at home, and got my le&s;&s;on when the other &s;ervants went out among&s;t whores, and af|ter their own fun; and they laughed at me for &s;taying at home; but, by and by, when their doctor's bills came in, I laughed at
<PB N="310" REF="324">
them. And after eight weeks at Li&s;bon, when we were on the road, they were obliged to call me to interpret for them. When they left Li&s;bon their plea&s;ure there was over; and I enjoyed my own &s;atisfac|tion. My ma&s;ter, though he could &s;peak French and Latin as well as Engli&s;h, was obliged to a&s;k me the names of things in Spani&s;h; becau&s;e, when I was in Li&s;bon, I lo&s;t no time; but learned as much of the Spani&s;h language as I could.</P>
<P>Li&s;bon is the fine&s;t &s;ituation of a city in the world for trade and a fine air. It is built on &s;even hills, on the &s;ide of a fine ri|ver. You may &s;ee fifty miles acro&s;s a fine country, by looking out of the windows in Li&s;bon. The river is eight miles broad ju&s;t again&s;t the city. If you are a mile on the river, in a boat, you may &s;ee every hou&s;e in town, at one view. At this time General Maclean, a Scotchman, was Commander in
<PB N="311" REF="325">
Chief of the army in Portugal. I have often thought he had more re&s;pect paid to him than the Royal family had to them. Soon af|ter we arrived in Li&s;bon, a prince&s;s died &s;ix weeks old. She had a grander burial than a king or queen.</P>
<P>People of age go into purgatory to &s;uffer for their &s;ins, till they are prayed out of pur|gatory; but as &s;he had committed no &s;in, &s;he was to be received into Heaven directly. At the funeral there were about fifteen hundred hor&s;e in the proce&s;&s;ion, carrying noblemen, and gentlemen; be&s;ides car|riages mo&s;t grandly dre&s;&s;ed with caps and feathers. In a few days after, the King was taken ill, and kept his bed a long time, till all his phy&s;icians gave him over. They told the Queen they could pre&s;cribe no more for him. She was the King of Spain's own &s;i&s;ter. She de&s;ired to call Dr. Wade that at|tended the Engli&s;h in Li&s;bon. He was an
<PB N="312" REF="326">
Iri&s;h gentleman. He was de&s;ired to &s;ee the King next morning. The Queen &s;aid to the phy&s;icians, what &s;hall we do that the King may not be alarmed by &s;eeing a new face? They an&s;wered the Queen, they would &s;tand round the King's bed as u&s;ual; and that Dr. Wade &s;hould look through under one of our arms. It was agreed to by the Queen. When the Doctor &s;aw the Queen, after &s;ee|ing the King, he told her he would give the King what would be of &s;ervice to him. So he &s;aw the King every morning in the &s;ame manner as I have mentioned. He had the King &s;ix weeks under his care, which was the time he lived. Dr. Wade was rewarded for his &s;kill, and he was al&s;o knighted; his name was now Sir John Wade, and he lived very much re&s;pected; and, when he was &s;ent for by the Portugue&s;e, he had double the fees they gave their own countrymen. Sir John, my ma&s;ter, jaunted round the country, and was got a great deal better, and began to
<PB N="313" REF="327">
think of going over land to Cadiz, in Spain. He hired a chai&s;e and mules, and mules for the baggage; and he had an interpreter to go as far as the confines of Portugal. There were two French gentlemen in company with my ma&s;ter, going to Cadiz; they had a chai&s;e and black &s;ervant. After dinner we &s;ailed acro&s;s the river Tagus, where our chai&s;es were ready, at the inns at Alldea Gallega, at the &s;ign of the Frog; there we were &s;hewn up to a very long room with nothing in it; but, in ten minutes, I fur|ni&s;hed the place. Henry, the interpreter, and I, put up our camp, table, &s;tools, my ma&s;ter's camp bed, and Mi&s;s Kitty's cur|tains. I opened up my little ca&s;e with wine, and put it on the table for Sir John. We had one end of the room, and the two Frenchmen the other. I put out the tra|velling-pye, and the gentlemen had an|other. We had plates and di&s;hes made of tin, knives, &s;poons, gla&s;&s;es, pepper, our
<PB N="314" REF="328">
own candles, every thing for our u&s;e. As it was early in the night for &s;upper; my ma&s;ter a&s;ked me if I could get him a di&s;h of the Queen of Scot's &s;oup. I &s;ent Henry to enquire if he could get chickens, eggs, and par&s;ley below. I made a fine di&s;h of &s;oup, and Sir John invited the Frenchmen to &s;up with him. They liked the &s;oup, and ate nothing el&s;e. No per&s;on belonging to the hou&s;e came near us; and we wanted nothing below but water, and a kettle to boil the &s;oup. When I was in the kitchen, I had an opportunity of &s;eeing the family go to &s;upper. The ma&s;ter, mi&s;tre&s;s, children, and maid, &s;at down as if they feared God. He took off his hat, put it before his face, and &s;aid grace. We all &s;lept in one room; Henry and I had only one blanket, and our great coats under our heads.</P>
<P>From the time I left Li&s;bon, till I re|turned to England, I became, or travelled,
<PB N="315" REF="329">
as a Roman Catholick. I had &s;een many different religions, and found it was be&s;t to pay re&s;pect to the people, and conform to their religion. In the morning we packed up our baggage, and paid our bills. The two chai&s;es brought to the door two mules for Henry and me; a man on foot to bring our two mules back, and another man, with two mules, for our baggage. Each of us wore a &s;word or hanger. We never went fa&s;ter than a waggon in England, except down hill. The carriages are &s;trong, and heavy laden. The roads are bad in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>When my ma&s;ter &s;aw that the two gentle|men had only one chai&s;e for them and their black boy, he de&s;ired one of them to come in with him; &s;o we &s;et off for Palmella through a fine country. One of the Frenchmen gave me his gunpowder, and &s;hot, and net, that I might &s;hoot at game as I rode along. I put the powder, &s;hot, and bag, for the game, round
<PB N="316" REF="330">
my &s;houlder, and the gun in my hand; and was glad of the opportunity, as it is an open country, and the game plenty. I had great luck. I rode on a little before; and I often &s;hot the game in the view of the gentlemen. My mule &s;topped in a moment, and neither of the mules were afraid of the report of the gun. What I &s;hot in the day, Henry and I dre&s;&s;ed at night.</P>
<P>We got to Palmella by noon, a fine village. We dined there. After &s;topping long enough to refre&s;h, we &s;et off for St. Ubes, a large town. In the morning we went for Mo|lines, and on our way cro&s;&s;ed the river Ca|daon. After dinner we went through a fine l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">vel country, between two ridges of fine high hills, and at night arrived at Alcaar, where we &s;topt. We were obligated to go and buy any thing we wanted. The maid &s;upplied us in the kitchen with wood and water, and Henry and I were cooks. In the
<PB N="317" REF="331">
morning we left Alcaar to go to Gandola. This day we cro&s;&s;ed two branches of the river Cadaon; and the &s;ame day we bought twenty-four full grown &s;weet oranges for three-pence, it being a fine country for fruit and trees. On our right, to the we&s;t of Gandola, was a large ridge of mountains, covered with trees, and the country well cul|tivated. After dinner, we pa&s;&s;ed through Villa, and through Terreir Adaves, both on branches of the river Guadiana, one of the longe&s;t rivers in all Spain. In the morn|ing of this day, one of the French gentlemen a&s;ked Henry to come into the chai&s;e with the black boy, and let him ride his mule. Henry went into the chai&s;e, and the gen|tleman rode along with me. We both con|ver&s;ed on different things. It was a fine day, and I had plenty of &s;port with the gun. At la&s;t I came to a cro&s;s road, where was the Virgin Mary, and Chri&s;t in her arms. I put off my hat, lowered it, and put it on
<PB N="318" REF="332">
again, and then cro&s;&s;ed my&s;elf. He &s;aid, Don't you belong to the Church of England? Yes, Sir. I thought you never paid any re&s;pect, in your wor&s;hip, to the holy Virgin. In our wor&s;hip we do not, but we e&s;teem her.</P>
<P>At night we came to a fine large city called Bijah, with fine hou&s;es, and well for|tified. Here we had very good inns. The gentlemen had a bed, and &s;o had Henry and I; but Sir John lay in his own bed. We had fi&s;h, partridges, and chickens, with vege|tables; and we had fine wine, and every thing agreeable. Oppo&s;ite to the inn was a ball of the middling &s;ort of the young peo|ple in town. After my ma&s;ter was gone to bed, Henry and I went over, and we were let in. We &s;at and &s;aw them dance country dances, and dance in the Portugue&s;e manner, which was very entertaining. I paid a quar|ter dollar for Henry and me, and came away.
<PB N="319" REF="333">
They were very civil to us; but there was nothing at the ball to drink. When the young gentlemen handed the girls to their chairs, after the dance was done, they took their &s;nuff-box out of their pocket, and gave their partner a pinch of &s;nuff. We came home, and had &s;ome wine to drink, and left them to take &s;nuff.</P>
<P>In the morning early we &s;et off for Mor|tola, on the confines of Portugal. This day we pa&s;&s;ed through the mo&s;t beautiful country for hills, woods, and waters. We cro&s;&s;ed &s;everal branches of the river Gua|diana. We pa&s;&s;ed through Alvi&s;til, a fine town, Ma&s;&s;ejena, another fine large town, and dined at Alcarina. After dinner we pa&s;&s;ed through &s;ome villages, and pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ome convents; and, in the evening, ar|rived at Mortola. This town &s;tands very high on the banks of the river Guadiana, &s;urrounded by a great number of very high
<PB N="320" REF="334">
hills, of bare rocks, more barren and wild than ever I &s;aw in the Highlands of Scot|land. We put up at the only inn in town, a very good one. The ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s were very good people; we had plenty of every thing. I made the Queen of Scot's &s;oup; and the mi&s;tre&s;s and I drank a bottle of wine together. There was &s;omething &s;ingular in the man that walked along with us to bring back the two &s;addle mules. He was one of the mo&s;t obliging and conde|&s;cending men I ever &s;aw. You could not &s;peak to him but off went his hat. He was always along-&s;ide my mule. When I gave him a penny to get a pint of wine, he was as happy as a prince.</P>
<P>Here we di&s;charged our chai&s;es and mules, becau&s;e we were to go by water. We were very good cu&s;tomers to the hou&s;e. Be&s;ides what we had in the hou&s;e, we had provi|&s;ions from them to &s;erve us on the water.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="335">
Next day, after breakfa&s;t, we all went into a boat to go down the river for Ago|menta, in Spain. We &s;ailed ten miles on the river in Portugal, and twenty between Portugal and Spain; Portugal on our right hand, and Spain on our left. Sometimes we went a&s;hore in Spain; at other times in Por|tugal, at the villages. In the evening we came to Ca&s;tromarin, a fine new village. Here we remained till Sir John &s;hewed the Go|vernor of Javira his pa&s;&s;port, and got another to go out of Portugal. I mu&s;t &s;ay of the country people, they are civil, innocent, and harmle&s;s; though it is &s;aid, a man's life is in danger, in Li&s;bon, if he be late out at night. That may be becau&s;e the de&s;perate, in all countries, flock to the capital.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e, at a di&s;tance from Li&s;|bon, are as much afraid of the Li&s;bonites as any other &s;trangers. My ma&s;ter was not ready till the afternoon of the next day.
<PB N="322" REF="336">
Then we cro&s;&s;ed the river, and went into the city of Agamonte in Spain. We left the two French gentlemen behind at Ca&s;tro|morin; the river, at this part, is three miles broad. Sir John was &s;hewn to the be&s;t inns in town. We had good wine and a good &s;upper, made ready by the landlady, a widow, a good &s;ort of a woman. When the cloth was laid, they put three covers on the table. But, when I put down the &s;up|per, I took off all the plates but one, and I waited on my ma&s;ter; and, when he was done, Henry and I &s;upped, very comfort|ably, in the &s;ame room; for it was both parlour and kitchen,</P>
<P>When we cro&s;&s;ed the river from Portugal to the city of Agamonte we entered into the province of Andalu&s;ia, formerly a kingdom. In the morning, the gentleman that my ma&s;ter was recommended to &s;ent for a man, and hired five mules to carry us and the bag|gage.
<PB N="323" REF="337">
The gentleman, Mr. Lepo, lent Sir John an Engli&s;h &s;addle to be returned with the mules. Henry and I rode above the baggage. When all was ready, we rode through the fine city of Agamonte. As we were riding along the &s;treet, a fine wo|man came to look out of a window; but, &s;eeing us, &s;he in a moment di&s;appeared, for fear that any one &s;hould &s;ee her looking after &s;trangers. Agamonte is a fine city for trade, being near the &s;ea, on the banks of the ri|ver, in a fine cultivated country. We went to Taron to dinner; and, at night, to Lepe, through a beautiful level country. All this day's journey was near the &s;ea. Taron and Lepe are fine large towns; but no women to be &s;een. The Spaniards, like the Por|tugue&s;e, are kind and civil; and have not the lea&s;t idea of overcharging, like the French. Next day we dined at Cortay, and after|wards cro&s;&s;ed the river Sally; and, in the afternoon, cro&s;&s;ed the river Odier to Gibral|con,
<PB N="324" REF="338">
a large town, where we had good ac|commodations. When the two Spaniards went to buy corn for the mules, I went along with them. There was a woman of the town who wanted me to pa&s;s the night with her. I promi&s;ed, but I did not perform. But Henry went in place of me. We were very happy here the whole evening. Sir John and I, and the man belonging to the mules, &s;lept in one room; and in the clo&s;et, that had no door, &s;lept the ma&s;ter and mi&s;|tre&s;s, and the daughter, a pretty girl, about fifteen. I got up in the night to make water; but, finding no pot, I went to the daugh|ter's bed-&s;ide, and took her pot. I put it be&s;ide Sir John's camp-bed; and, ju&s;t before day light, I put it back again; and then I lay down. About &s;ix o'clock Henry called us. I made &s;ome fine chocolate for Sir John; and, after breakfa&s;t, we &s;et out for St. Juan, a long &s;tage of eighteen miles. We &s;topped at a hou&s;e on the road, &s;ix
<PB N="325" REF="339">
miles from Gibralcon, to give the mules hay and water; and we ate &s;ome hard-boiled eggs, bread and wine, which we always had with us. Soon after, when we were on the road, it began to rain, and continued ince&s;|&s;antly the whole day. We had not a place to &s;top at till we came to St. Juan. I was obliged to take part of the oil-cloth that covered the baggage to hang on Sir John's, on the &s;ide next the &s;torm. We had &s;everal wine-merchants on the road with us.</P>
<P>When we arrived, we were put into a hou&s;e quite empty. The &s;table was part of the hou&s;e; and the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e lived next door. His name was Phillips. He kept a &s;hop like a grocer's, or chandler's &s;hop in London. He &s;ent us wood for fire, or what|ever we wanted. We were there three nights on account of the rain having &s;welled the rivers &s;o high that we could not pa&s;s; there was no bridge nor ferry-boat. Phillips &s;ent
<PB N="326" REF="340">
whatever we wanted; and was a good hearty rich fellow. The third night I was there, he dre&s;&s;ed me in a Spani&s;h dre&s;s, and took me out with him to &s;ome of his friend's hou&s;es, and to a public hou&s;e, where we &s;topped &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Next day we were informed the rivers were fallen. We &s;et off for Lucar; and, in the way, we cro&s;&s;ed the rivers Tinto and Moncanilla. Lucar is a large city, remark|able for fine churches, which we went to &s;ee. It is &s;urrounded by promenades. At this time there was &s;tationed at this place a regiment of hor&s;e and foot. The officers and ladies were walking together; but the ladies were all veiled. Here Sir John cho&s;e to &s;top all night. Next day we went acro&s;s the plains of Almonte; and, at the city of Almonte, we dined. In cro&s;&s;ing the plains we &s;aw a drove of two thou&s;and hogs, mo&s;tly blacks, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t from different places of the country for
<PB N="327" REF="341">
the great city of Seville. The Spaniards are fonder of hogs-fle&s;h than even the Engli&s;h. At night we went to a village called Atalia, near the &s;ea. Here the kitchen and &s;table were both in one. The mules were at one end, and all the &s;trangers at the other. Every one was his own cook; and I dre&s;&s;ed the Queen of Scot's &s;oup. As for the two French gentlemen, we left them in Aga|monte. After it was dark, at Atalia, the doors were &s;hut, and we were de&s;ired not to go out for fear of thieves that lurked in the neighbourhood. Next day we travelled along the &s;ea-&s;hore to Nepuero, a little vil|lage at the bottom of the great river of Gua|dalquivir. As we had not more than &s;ixteen miles to go that day, we were in no great ha&s;te. Sir John and I walked about &s;ix miles on the &s;ands, picking up &s;hells of a very fine kind; which were brought to London.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="342">
As we were coming to Nepuero, we &s;aw a &s;hip in di&s;tre&s;s, though it was a very fine day. The &s;hip was no more than a mile from us, and a lee-&s;hore. They did all in their power to get to &s;ea from land, but all in vain. She was loaded with fi&s;h from Newfound|land, and was &s;plit on a rock near the bot|tom of the river. Next day we dined at Nepuero, and di&s;charged our men and mules. We had a boat, and cro&s;&s;ed the river oppo|&s;ite the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, where the river is two miles over. Our baggage was taken into the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and cleared, and afterwards we had a cart to put it in. We had to walk two miles to the city of St. Lucar to the inns, where we had good accommodations and bet|ter beds than we had &s;ince we left Li&s;bon. We &s;topped at St. Lucar a week. Sir John &s;topped with his two friends, Mr. Hunter and Mr. Carr, wine-merchants. The but|ler came from Edinburgh; he and I went next morning to &s;ee the ve&s;&s;el that was broke
<PB N="329" REF="343">
to pieces, and we &s;aw the tide drive the fi&s;h on &s;hore. The people of St. Lucar had a fine chance to get &s;o many thou&s;and fine cod for nothing.</P>
<P>When the gentlemen went out to ride, Mr. Hamilton, the butler, and I, went out with the two grey-hounds a cour&s;ing, and we had very good &s;port. St. Lucar is a very fine city for trade. It &s;tands near the &s;ea, on one of the fine&s;t rivers in the world. On the other &s;ide are a great many hills, and a fortification about a mile from town. We went into the fort, and there we found Engli&s;h, Iri&s;h, Scotch, and Wel&s;h &s;oldiers in the King of Spain's &s;ervice, and fine ea&s;y lives they had, never to &s;tir from St. Lucar and the fort. The hou&s;e where Sir John lodged at St. Lucar, was one of the large&s;t wine-hou&s;es in the town. I went into the wine &s;tore|cellars, which re&s;emble a brewer's great &s;tore|cellar in London. The morning we left St.
<PB N="330" REF="344">
Lucar, we &s;ent our baggage away in a cart by four in the morning; and we &s;et off by &s;ix in the morning. We rode fifteen miles acro&s;s a fine country, abounding in vine|yards and figs. The baggage and we arrived at Port St. Mary's by eleven o'clock, at the Three Pigeon's Hotel, in a very fine town, with a fine promenade at the end of Port St. Mary's for gentlemen and ladies. We dined at the Hotel, and as we had but nine miles to Cadiz acro&s;s the &s;ea, Sir John was very de&s;irous to be there that day, although the wind was very high. I told Sir John that the wind was very high to go in an open boat. He &s;aid the boatmen knew be&s;t. As all the boats were gone that took the regular fare, (of about eight-pence each per&s;on) my ma|&s;ter engaged one for about eight dollars. When we were making ready to go to the boat, Bernardo, the landlord, an Italian, &s;aid, Mr. John, the wind is high, but the men ven|tured on account of getting &s;o much money.
<PB N="331" REF="345">
So we went into the large open boat, with one ma&s;t and one large &s;ail. The ma&s;ter and eight of his men, Sir John, three Spani&s;h Gentlemen, and Henry and I were on board. We had not proceeded a mile when the wind became very high. In ten minutes it blew a tempe&s;t; the men being fre&s;h water &s;ailors, had the &s;ail too high, which laid the boat very much on one &s;ide. A &s;ea came and fil|led the boat half full of water. When I &s;aw that, I made a motion to lower the &s;ail, which they did half way down: if not, the next &s;ea would have &s;wallowed us up. By this time Sir John thought all was over in this life for us, and Henry &s;at at my feet trembling and &s;peechle&s;s. The men had two pails and went to work, to throw the water out of the boat. A wave took away one pail, and in a few mi|nutes the other pail was carried away al&s;o; then more water came in; every one in the boat expected every moment to be lo&s;t. The boatmen were crying for their wives and fami|lies.
<PB N="332" REF="346">
I &s;at on the windward &s;ide of the boat, with my arms on the rigging, encouraging Sir John, as he had not &s;een &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s as I had &s;een. The gentlemen were all on the little deck behind, with the baggage be&s;ide me. Sir John called loudly to the people on board an Engli&s;h man of war to the wind|ward of us, but they could give us no a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. I gave my&s;elf up for lo&s;t, but I thought within my&s;elf, I &s;hall fare as my ma&s;ter, and no wor&s;e. I never &s;aw &s;uch a &s;cene. The men in water up to their middles, crying, and throwing out the water with their hats, and we as wet as them. I &s;aw no alteration on the Spani&s;h gentlemen: but they were &s;peaking about Sir John and me being Engli&s;h, and thought that God had rai&s;ed the &s;torm on our account. One of the gentlemen a&s;ked if we were Engli&s;h; I an&s;wered we were, and then he a&s;ked me if we were Catholics of Eng|land. When we were at our wits end, it plea&s;ed God to calm the wind a great deal.
<PB N="333" REF="347">
At la&s;t we got near the harbour, and I &s;poke to Henry, but he could not an&s;wer me a word. Sir John &s;aid, he had not got the better of the fright yet. When we got near the Pier of Cadiz, we had great difficulty to get on &s;hore, as the waves da&s;hed &s;o much again&s;t the Pier. We got into the little boat from the great one, to take us on &s;hore, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the rope, we got up out of the boat. There were many hundreds of people glad to &s;ee us come &s;afe off the water. Sir John paid the people his com|pliments, by lifting off his hat, and making a bow. We went to the White Hor&s;e Hotel all night. At night Sir John &s;ent a letter to his friend, Mr. Duff, a great merchant at Cadiz. Mr. Duff came home late. In the morning he came to &s;ee Sir John, and invited him to be at his hou&s;e while in Cadiz. We went to the hou&s;e of Mr. Duff and Wel&s;h, in Com|pany, and next day my ma&s;ter di&s;charged Henry, as he met with an opportunity to go
<PB N="334" REF="348">
with a gentlemen for Li&s;bon. Next day, as I was dre&s;&s;ing Sir John Stuart, he &s;aid, John, I think we e&s;caped wonderfully well with our lives coming from Port St. Mary's. Yes, thank God, I do a&s;&s;ure you, Sir John, though I did not &s;hew the lea&s;t marks of fear, I expected every moment to be lo&s;t. I thought within my&s;elf, I have e&s;caped many dangers, and if I am to die here, I &s;hall fare no wor&s;e than my ma&s;ter in death and burying.</P>
<P>Mr. Duff was &s;on to the Sheriff of Air in Scotland, and nephew to Mr. Hamilton of Bargeny, who brought me up. Mr. Hamilton had a brother at the &s;ame time in great trade, William Dalrymple, E&s;q. at Cadiz. In Mr. Duff and Wel&s;h's hou&s;e there were no maid|&s;ervants, it not being the cu&s;tom for the &s;ingle men in Cadiz. In the hou&s;e were the butler and his mate, as hou&s;e-man, the head cook and his mate, two Frenchmen and two Italians. I cleaned my ma&s;ter's room and
<PB N="335" REF="349">
my own, and made our beds, and we were as happy as kings together. There is not &s;o much demand for women &s;ervants in Spain, as there are no fine places; only in the kitchen, and, as in Scotland, the cooks are mo&s;tly all men.</P>
<P>Cadiz is as plea&s;ant as any city in Europe; it &s;tands on a penin&s;ula, mo&s;tly encompa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ea, and fortified all round. The gentlemen and ladies mo&s;tly walk on the ramparts for the pro&s;pect, and there are &s;eats. There is al&s;o a fine promenade under trees, and tho&s;e that are in carriages go round the promenade, &s;o they can all &s;ee one another every afternoon. There are many fine churches in Cadiz. There is a very good cu&s;tom in Spain.&mdash;Every evening when the &s;un &s;ets the bell tolls in all the churches, the men and women &s;top in a moment, of whatever &s;ta|tion, on the promenade or &s;treet, while the prie&s;ts in church &s;ay the Lord's Prayer. The
<PB N="336" REF="350">
men lift off their hats, the ladies put their fans before their face, to pray that God would pre&s;erve them through night, as he had done through the day, and to thank God for their daily bread. When the oration is done in church, the bell tolls again; then the gentlemen bow to the ladies, and they all walk on again. All carriages and hor&s;emen &s;topped in the &s;ame manner. The prie&s;ts go about the &s;treets about nine o'clock at night, with lanterns that give a great light, and &s;top at particular places to pray and prai&s;e, to caution people from doing wickedne&s;s in the night, and tell them the folly of wicked|ne&s;s, and &s;ufferings that follow. The &s;treets are very good in Cadiz, and the hou&s;es are high, and make a noble appearance; they are white, built of &s;tone and lime; they are the mo&s;t convenient in the world for &s;ervants. When you enter in the &s;treet-door, you are in a &s;quare, paved with marble; it is open to the heavens. Round the hall are cellars and
<PB N="337" REF="351">
warehou&s;es, the &s;tairs are at one corner. When you get up to the fir&s;t floor, all round are rooms and counting-hou&s;es. There is an iron railing round the gallery: the &s;econd, third, and fourth is in the &s;ame manner; &s;o the hou&s;e is always open. There is a rope fixed to the latch of the &s;treet-door from the iron railing on each floor, oppo&s;ite the &s;treet-door; &s;o that whatever place of the hou&s;e a &s;ervant is in, he comes out of the room and looks over the railing, pulls the latch of the &s;treet-door with the cord; the per&s;on comes in and walks up &s;tairs, then the door falls to again. If it is a me&s;&s;age, the &s;ervant takes, or gives it. When you get on the top of the hou&s;e, it is flat and plea&s;ant to walk on, or drink tea in the evening. The top of it is fine|ly ornamented with cut-&s;tone. Where you walk, it is paved with fine flat tiles. In Ca|diz there is no water but rain collected from the hou&s;e tops; there is indeed water brought from Port St. Mary's acro&s;s the &s;ea, for gen|tlemen
<PB N="338" REF="352">
and ladies. Many men &s;upport their families by this trade. In the afternoon the men carry a large ca&s;k upon their backs, two gla&s;&s;es, and a clean napkin in their hand. They go up to gentlemen and ladies, and &s;ell the company this water. It is plea&s;ing to &s;ee &s;o many fine gentlemen and ladies walk on the ramparts, and on the promenade, from whence they have &s;o exten&s;ive a view, both by &s;ea and land. Cadiz is &s;o compact, that a man may walk round it in an hour.</P>
<P>All the ladies in the &s;outh of Spain, when they walk out, are veiled. As we came to Cadiz before Lent, I fa&s;ted the whole time as they did; but our fa&s;t would have been a fea&s;t to a Londoner; for we had fine bread and wine, tea and fine butter; and at dinner &s;alt fi&s;h, potatoes, par&s;|nips; plenty of &s;auce, fi&s;h &s;tewed in wine, fre&s;h fi&s;h boiled, and other fi&s;h broiled; eggs fried, and eggs and &s;pinage every day; the
<PB N="339" REF="353">
gentlemen in the parlour had what they liked be&s;ides; for the family was large.</P>
<P>Sir John had not been at Cadiz above three weeks when he was taken ill with an inter|mitting fever. Mr. Macguire, the phy&s;ician of Cadiz, an Iri&s;h gentleman, attended him. Sir John had no nur&s;e but my&s;elf who attended him. I never pulled off my cloaths for &s;ix|teen nights. I had a fire burning all night, and a lamp to warm every thing he wanted. I laid on the couch in the next room. At la&s;t he became &s;o weak that he could hardly call me. I &s;aid, Sir, if you plea&s;e, I will put a thing round my wri&s;t in the night, and when you want me, pull the cord, and I will wake in a moment; but Sir John rather cho&s;e I &s;hould lie on the mattra&s;s by his bed-&s;ide; and I did as he de&s;ired me. Before three weeks his fever changed and turned to an ague and fever; then he was well &s;ome times, and then he could walk out, and ride in a
<PB N="340" REF="354">
carriage. At this time there was a yearly proce&s;&s;ion, and as it pa&s;&s;ed by Mr. Duff's hou&s;e, it was very entertaining to my ma&s;ter. It began on Monday and ended on Saturday. It begins with Judas betraying our Lord, and through the week taking Chri&s;t before Pi|late, and his trial and &s;courging, and carry|ing his cro&s;s, and Simon the Cyrenean a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing our Lord to carry the cro&s;s, and his be|ilng on the cro&s;s between the two thieves, and then left alone, except the Virgin Mary, her &s;i&s;ter, and the wife of Cleophas, Mary Magdalen, and John the beloved. On Sa|turday Judas throws down the money, and then hangs him&s;elf. Tho&s;e &s;cenes are on &s;tages drawn on wheels. The proce&s;&s;ion is every day after breakfa&s;t performed by &s;eve|ral hundreds of the gentlemen in town dre&s;&s;ed with their &s;words, and each having a lighted torch in his hand, and accompanied by the prie&s;ts in grand order.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="355">
Sir John getting a little better, Dr. Macguire recommended him to the air of Port St. Mary's, where he went, and put up at Bernardo's, the Three Pigeon's Hotel, where we were before. My ma&s;ter had a room at the end of the great dining hall, with two beds; at the other end was General O'Reiley, the commander in chief of the army in the &s;outh part of Spain. The General was an Iri&s;hman, and had a grand attendance, though not one Briti&s;h or Iri&s;h &s;ervant about him. Several of the gentlemen came to &s;ee Sir John; and one Mr. Walm&s;ley, an Engli&s;h gentleman, who had a fine hou&s;e and gardens in the country, two miles from Port St. Mary's, invited Sir John to come and drink milk in the morning, or whatever he liked. My ma&s;ter got a large jack-a&s;s that belonged to the Hotel. He put an Engli&s;h &s;addle on the a&s;s and rode him. We &s;et out at &s;ix in the morning. I put my coat over my left &s;houlder becau&s;e the weather was hot. I
<PB N="342" REF="356">
walked, and the a&s;s followed me. This la&s;ted ten days, during which time we re|turned every day to breakfa&s;t. Mr. Duff &s;ent his own mule round by land to Port St. Mary's, then I rode the a&s;s, and we vi&s;ited every afternoon different places of the coun|try. No king in the world could enjoy more plea&s;ure than we did, by going from place to place. After General O'Reiley left the Hotel, the Bi&s;hop of Seville came to the apartments and dined, on his way to Cadiz.</P>
<P>After three weeks at Port St. Mary's, Sir John returned to Cadiz a great deal better, only the ague and fever every three days, and he continued to take the bark. At our return to Cadiz the bull fights began, the manner of which is as follows:&mdash;The theatre is large and round, open over head, the &s;eats ri&s;e from the middle of a gra&s;s plat, like the &s;eats in the two &s;hillings gallery of a play-hou&s;e;
<PB N="343" REF="357">
a po&s;t is fixed towards one end of the plat, and a baboon chained to it. Before the company came, ten bulls are brought to a &s;table under the gallery. When the company are come, and the Governor and his family &s;eated, a bell rings; the large monkey is on the po&s;t, three men on hor&s;e-back, with good boots on, with a large &s;pur in their right hand, &s;tand clo&s;e together a-brea&s;t: one bull is turn|ed out, he &s;tamps on the ground, looks at the company, the monkey and three men on hor&s;e-back, and the three men are ready to receive him. The bull runs full drive at one of the hor&s;es; the rider is &s;ure to pierce the bull's &s;houlder with his &s;pear. He alone mu&s;t attack the bull, and mu&s;t engage him in front. Sometimes the bull throws the man and hor&s;e on the ground, at other times he rips up the hor&s;e's belly, and you will then &s;ee the hor&s;e's guts trailing on the ground. When the bull gives the hor&s;e the fir&s;t thru&s;t, a per&s;on is ready, in a light dre&s;s,
<PB N="344" REF="358">
with a piece of &s;ilk of the length of a mid|ling table-cloath; the bull to&s;&s;es the &s;ilk with his horns, and the rider e&s;capes to a place for the purpo&s;e. The &s;econd time the hor&s;e|men get them&s;elves ready again, and the bull having received the wounds, is more mad than before. Sometimes he runs at the monkey, and then there is a general laugh. When &s;ix minutes are over, a bell rings for that &s;cene to fini&s;h; then the hor&s;emen &s;tand to one &s;ide, and another player turns out with two arrows in his hands, each about a yard long, the point &s;harp, like the point of a &s;mall fi&s;hing hook. He meets the bull in full gallop, runs the arrow through between his horns, in his &s;houlders, or neck; the bull takes one round in the Circus, then another man turns out. The monkey guards his chain, and ob&s;erves the whole performance. The bull engages the &s;econd, third, &amp;c. till he has eight or ten arrows dangling in his back and &s;houlders; then he is wound up to
<PB N="345" REF="359">
a great pitch of madne&s;s. When the &s;ix minutes are over, the bell rings, and tho&s;e men withdraw; then one of the head per|formers turns out with an Andrea Ferara in his hand, and meets the bull when he is on full gallop. He directs the &s;word between the horns, down through his &s;houlders into his heart. The bull falls and expires. In a minute a young man comes with three hor&s;es a-brea&s;t of one another, harne&s;&s;ed and fine|ly decorated with feathers. He fixes the harne&s;s round the horns, and drags the car|ca&s;e full gallop to the &s;laughter-hou&s;e. The meat is &s;old next day for two-pence per pound to the publick. Often the &s;word&s;men mi&s;s their thru&s;t, and &s;ometimes the bull carries away the &s;word in his &s;houlders. At other times, when the &s;word&s;man thinks him&s;elf &s;ure, he makes a bow to &s;ome lady, and &s;ays, In honour of &s;uch a lady, I will kill the bull at one thru&s;t. If he &s;ucceeds, the company throw down a
<PB N="346" REF="360">
great deal of money to him; but if not, he is hi&s;&s;ed out of the Circus.</P>
<P>After being at Cadiz for &s;ome time, and Sir John not getting quit of his ague, he laid a&s;ide his intended trip to Africa. He re|&s;olved to accompany &s;ome gentlemen home. He was at a lo&s;s at fir&s;t whether he &s;hould go by &s;ea or land, but afterwards preferred the latter. Mr. Duff applied to General O'Reiley for an Iri&s;h or Scotch &s;oldier to go behind the coach, and be guard and inter|preter. Before we got away, we felt an earthquake, on the tenth day of May, in the forenoon. Sir John was laid on his bed; the cook and I were employed in the kitchen. The whole city of Cadiz was &s;omewhat rai&s;ed and rocked, and &s;unk again. The cook called on Je&s;us and Mary; and I cried out, Je&s;us Chri&s;t! my ma&s;ter will be killed in bed. Every face in Cadiz was as pale as a&s;hes. In
<PB N="347" REF="361">
ten minutes the people were praying and prai&s;ing on the &s;treets; however, &s;ome tubs were over&s;et.</P>
<P>Two days after, we went to Port St. Mary's, and a great many gentlemen in company, who &s;topped all night with my ma&s;ter at Bernardo's. In a few days after, my ma&s;ter hired a coach and &s;ix mules that was going to Madrid. He found there were or|ders for every one to join their regiment, as the French were expected to join the Ame|ricans; &s;o that General O'Reiley would not let Sir John have a &s;oldier. So we went without an interpreter or guard. We left the plea&s;ant place, Port St. Mary's, with our coach and &s;ix mules, worth &s;ixty or &s;eventy guineas each.</P>
<P>About the middle of May we &s;et out for Madrid, three hundred and fifty miles di&s;|tant. We went very little fa&s;ter than a wag|gon
<PB N="348" REF="362">
in England. We only went one &s;hort &s;tage the fir&s;t night, to Xeres, the principal town for cherry-wine in Spain. Great re|&s;pect is paid to gold-lace; and I was mi&s;|taken, at the inns, for Sir John. I begged of my ma&s;ter to wear &s;ome of his gold-laced cloaths, which he did all through Spain. The inns were tolerable; and the waiter laid the cloth for Sir John and me. I &s;up|ped with Sir John, for the fir&s;t time; and &s;lept in the &s;ame room till we came to St. Jean de Luz in France. Next morning early we &s;et out for Arcos. We commonly &s;et out by four, to travel in the cool of the morning. On the road, when we were let into an empty room, where we were taken no notice of, I was cook; the maid would get me water, and make a fire. I had a ca&s;e of fine wine for my ma&s;ter, and &s;herry for my&s;elf; I had &s;pices, &s;alt, and rice, and a little copper pot, with a &s;helf at top, for the meat. I dre&s;&s;ed the dinner for next day.
<PB N="349" REF="363">
I had &s;oup in the bottom of the pot, and the fowl at top; the cover came half way down the out&s;ide, &s;o that no du&s;t could get in. At dinner time I had only to warm the dinner. I hung the pot under the perch of the coach, by a rope. I could buy par|tridges, fowls, chickens, eggs, and &s;ome fi&s;h, which I &s;tewed in wine. We com|monly had our luncheon on the road; the coachman, and his nephew on the box, would eat their's, and we in the coach our's; we commonly had cold broiled chicken, or &s;ome partridge. As I dre&s;&s;ed plenty, Sir John de&s;ired me to give the ma&s;|ter of the coach part, out of the window; &s;o we were all at luncheon together, and going &s;low. I made chocolate over night to drink at four in the morning. Sir John never had a return of the ague on the road, which made the journey very plea&s;ing, and no man upon earth more happy than me, travelling through a fine country where the
<PB N="350" REF="364">
harve&s;t was all in by the twentieth of May. At night we flept at the town of Bornos. Nothing remarkable but merriment. Our coachman was a fine hand&s;ome man; and he and his nephew were very fond of dancing. A per&s;on came with the guittar; and he danced with the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, and another girl. It co&s;t me many a &s;hilling to to pay for mu&s;ick, travelling along. Very few days but he and his nephew dined at eve|ry &s;tage we &s;topped at.</P>
<P>Next morning we dined at E&s;pera, after pa&s;&s;ing the mountains of Alhoquina. We left E&s;pera and travelled along a fine country, well cultivated, finely wooded, and watered, and at night we came to a fine town called Utera, and then to Marchina. From thence we came at night to a fine city called Exija, leaving the great city of Sevillia on our left hand. Here we cro&s;&s;ed a branch of the ri|ver Guadlaquivir and went to Palma to din|ner,
<PB N="351" REF="365">
and we cro&s;&s;ed another branch of the river, and &s;topped at the town of Pa&s;ados. We were here early in the evening. The people of the inns were relations of Pro&s;illa, the coachman. Sir John was very glad to &s;ee Pro&s;illa dance. He always put a rattle on each hand, which kept time to the mu&s;ick. As Sir John was very glad to &s;ee him, he him|&s;elf danced a fandango. I went to the church every place we came at, and I pa&s;&s;ed for a Ro|man Catholick. They a&s;ked me, if my ma&s;ter was a Roman Catholick: I &s;aid he was. It is Friday; and you are dre&s;&s;ing a fowl for him? I told them, when my ma&s;ter was at St. Lucar he went to &s;ee the high-prie&s;t, and de&s;ired to be permitted to eat meat as he was travelling through Spain for his health. The high|prie&s;t gave my ma&s;ter an indulgence to eat any &s;orts of birds, while in Spain, for which my ma&s;ter gave the poor of St. Lucar one hundred dollars, and my ma&s;ter has it in his pocket-book. That night I made an Ea&s;t-India pilaw for my ma&s;ter. I had a fine
<PB N="352" REF="366">
fowl &s;tewed with rice and butter, well &s;ea|&s;oned. I had hard boiled eggs, and boiled onions to garni&s;h the di&s;h. When it was making ready, the landlady was taken ill. I told Sir John. He de&s;ired me to take her a gla&s;s of brandy. She drank it. When I &s;erved in the &s;upper, Sir John &s;ent her a large plate full of the pilaw, and de&s;ired her to eat, as &s;he was a fellow-&s;ufferer with him&s;elf, and indeed &s;he eat hearty. I had fi&s;h for my &s;upper. Pro&s;illa and the others in company laughed hearty to them&s;elves that the landlady was &s;ick, and ate and drank heartily. If a per|&s;on be &s;ick, he is allowed to eat meat at that time, although it is in Lent, or on Friday. We left Pa&s;ados in the morning, and dined at the great city of Cordova, on the river Guadalquivir. Before my ma&s;ter had din|ner, we went to &s;ee a fine church that had &s;even hundred pillars of marble in the mid|dle. After dinner we went to Samo&s;&s;a, after cro&s;&s;ing the mountains of Con&s;tantina cover|ed
<PB N="353" REF="367">
with flowers of different colours. When I &s;aw a flower or plant that was &s;trange to me, I took the &s;eed and dried it by the &s;un, and brought it with me to &s;end to Scotland. Next morning we left Samo&s;&s;a, and dined at St. Bennet's in the province of New Ca&s;tile. In the afternoon we went over the mountains of Conovi&s;ta, and &s;topped at the town of Gorgortial, a fine town in a beautiful coun|try. We &s;topped at a very good inn, and the maid was good tempered. I dre&s;&s;ed the &s;upper, and the maid and I drank a bottle of wine together. When &s;he brought in the &s;upper, I was &s;etting up my ma&s;ter's tent bed. Sir John began to eat his &s;upper. The maid &s;aid, Why do you begin before your comrade? My ma&s;ter &s;aid, John, I &s;ee I can by no means begin till you come, without di&s;obliging the maid. I put on my coat in a minute and &s;at down to &s;upper. As I made the chocolate at night, &s;he &s;hewed me where &s;he &s;lept, that I might call her in the morn|ing.
<PB N="354" REF="368">
When I came to her bed&s;ide, before I called her, I took up her pockets and put in one dollar. Methinks a good-natured per&s;on &s;hould be re&s;pected and rewarded. I &s;aid, My dear, I beg your pardon, but I have called you an hour too &s;oon. She &s;aid, there is no harm done. Do you lay down till I make the fire and warm the chocolate, and when its ready, I will let you know. We went to dinner to Uenta del Aleada, and at night we &s;lept at a large town called Villa Major, at a good inn. That night there was a great deal of rain, thunder, and lightning; but within, very agreeable, and plenty of mu&s;ic and dancing; and the landlady was a great while conver&s;ing with my ma&s;ter. Af|ter &s;he was gone, I &s;aid, Sir, the gentlemen of Cadiz laughed at me, becau&s;e I &s;aid we had no kind of need of an interpreter. You &s;ee, Sir John, I was right, there would have been the man's expence, and he would have made them charge you double for every thing on
<PB N="355" REF="369">
the road. Sir John &s;aid, In a few months I could &s;peak Spani&s;h as well as French; it is half Latin, and I &s;peak Latin as well as French. When we were going to bed, it thundered very much. Sir John &s;aid, I believe there is not any one thing bad but I have met with &s;ince I left home. Sir, &s;aid I, if &s;ome of the old Scotch women were here, they would &s;ay, Certainly Sir John has for&s;aken &s;ome young lady, that he has &s;uch bad luck. I &s;aid this, becau&s;e I was informed he had for&s;aken one of the fine&s;t young ladies in Scotland, an heire&s;s; and took up with another heire&s;s as good as the other, whom he married after|wards. He made me no an&s;wer, for he knew what I &s;aid was right.</P>
<P>Next day we pa&s;&s;ed a fine country, and cro&s;&s;ed a branch of the river Guadiana, and &s;topped at the town of Luciana. After dinner we went over the mountains of Luciana, and &s;topped at the town of Piedrabuena,
<PB N="356" REF="370">
a fine country, near a large ridge of moun|tains. There is no danger of thieves in Spain. As you &s;top in towns or villages, you may leave five hundred pounds worth in your coach all night, without any danger; but the banditti on the mountains, or in large woods, are dan|gerous. Next day we dined at Mora. After pa&s;&s;ing the mountains of Mora and Cole, on a Saturday night, we arrived at the large and fine city of Toledo. We were at a good inn, and we had good accommodations. Here we cro&s;&s;ed the river Tagus, that runs pa&s;t Li&s;bon. We were in no great hurry to go off in the morning, as we had only one &s;tage to dinner, and to be there all night; the place where the King of Spain had his court. When Sir John was dre&s;&s;ed and gone down to breakfa&s;t, I was &s;having and dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf, when the maid came to make the bed; and, conver&s;ing together, &s;he a&s;ked me to &s;have her. I &s;aid, My dear, &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould &s;poil your pretty face. Sir, you &s;have, and your
<PB N="357" REF="371">
face is not &s;poiled. Very well, my dear, if you will give me a ki&s;s, I will &s;have you. So &s;he gave me a ki&s;s, and I &s;haved her; and I told her &s;he was the fir&s;t maid I had ever &s;haved. She was about &s;ixteen, and I was very &s;orry to leave her behind. After break|fa&s;t, we &s;et out, and arrived at Aranjuez, the mo&s;t beautiful village I ever &s;aw. Before we came to Aranjuez, we were going over the mo&s;t barren hill in Spain, and pre&s;ently we &s;aw before us the mo&s;t plea&s;ant valley, about ten miles long. At the bottom of the hill is the town, the mo&s;t complete building, of white hewen &s;tone, every &s;treet an&s;wering another, like the walks of a garden; plan|ned before a hou&s;e was built. The King's palace is at the &s;ide of the town, a beautiful building, on the banks of the river Tagus, at the end of a fine white &s;tone bridge, acro&s;s the river, in the King's delightful plea&s;ure gar|den, open for the publick to walk in. We &s;topped at the King's Arms. When our
<PB N="358" REF="372">
things were taken up &s;tairs, I, having nothing to do, walked out. I &s;aw the people going to the King's chapel, where the Queen and one of the Prince&s;&s;es were in the royal &s;eat. As I was very well dre&s;&s;ed, and had a &s;ilk bag on my hair, and a fine hanger by my &s;ide, I entered the chapel. When the &s;ervice was over, I came home. When Sir John was at dinner, I told him I had been at the chapel. He was attended by two Spani&s;h waiters. He was well &s;erved, they knowing him to be an Engli&s;hman, the Engli&s;h bearing the character of being &s;o rich and free. My ma&s;ter &s;aid, John, I have been count|ing how many di&s;hes they will bring to me. In all, I have had fourteen hot things. When my ma&s;ter was &s;peaking to me, the two waiters looked at my ma&s;ter and me. I &s;aid, Sir, I will go and &s;ee what I &s;hall have below. I went and dined, and told Sir John I had eleven hot things for my dinner.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="373">
My ma&s;ter &s;ent a letter to Lord Grantham, the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador, to let him know &s;uch a per&s;on was at the King's Arms. I went and &s;aw the King's gardens, and return|ed to tell Sir John the beauty of them. He went to &s;ee them, and returned, expecting the Earl of Grantham's an&s;wer: but I went along the road, and walked out &s;ide of the Queen's gardens, between the river and the great road leading to Madrid. It is near half a mile long, and half a quarter of a mile broad, open to view from the road, by a low wall, and fine iron railing; but the pub|lic are not allowed to enter. It produces all &s;orts of plants and fine flowers to put into the Queen's apartments, and in different places of the palace; and there are many fine trees growing between the river and garden. The great road by the garden has fine trees on each &s;ide, like tho&s;e in St. James's Park, London, where the ladies walk in the after|noon. This road is watered twice on each
<PB N="360" REF="374">
day, at the King's expence. The royal fa|mily come here an airing &s;ometimes, and the nobles and gentry come here in the cool of the afternoon. I have &s;een five hundred carriages at once. At accu&s;tomed places, they drive along one &s;ide of the road, and down the other. There are gentlemen and ladies on the footway, between the carriages and the Queen's gardens; &s;o they are all together, and not the lea&s;t du&s;t to be &s;een, the roads being &s;o well watered. One would not wi&s;h to &s;ee a finer &s;ight than the company. I went to the other &s;ide of the garden, and I &s;aw one of the gardeners coming from the building for the gardeners, and enter a back door of the garden. I went and found the door on the latch. I entered and walked along the gravel walk. When I came near, the gardeners, it being Sunday, they were looking at &s;ome flowers, not at work. They looked at me, and &s;eeing me to be a foreigner, and knowing how I came in, they took no far|ther
<PB N="361" REF="375">
notice. I walked round, and &s;aw &s;ome fine walks of trees and flowers. I put &s;ome flowers in my pocket, and walked out and came home to Sir John, and gave him the flowers from the Queen's gardens. He a&s;ked me how I got in there, I told him I had gone into many places that was not allowed for the public, becau&s;e I was a &s;tranger. He an&s;wered, You had better take care and not get into trouble by &s;o doing. Late at night Sir John had a letter from Lord Grantham, and waited on him next day; dined with his Lord&s;hip, and went to court. As I never &s;aw a place I liked &s;o well; at the &s;ame time I went to &s;ee the King's &s;tables, the hor&s;e|guards, and the King's dairy, the fine&s;t in Europe. The King of Spain &s;upplies all the amba&s;&s;adors with butter, milk, and cream, from his dairy, while he is in the country. If there be a place in the world at this time like the garden of Eden, it is Aranjuez. When Sir John came home, he told me what
<PB N="362" REF="376">
he had &s;een at the court, and how much the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador was re&s;pected by all the other amba&s;&s;adors. Sir John &s;aid, I would like to &s;tay here longer, but I have to pay Pro&s;illa the coachman one pound per day while I &s;tay here.&mdash;After four days at Aran|juez, we &s;et out for Madrid. We went five miles down the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river; then cro&s;&s;ed one of the fine&s;t bridges I ever &s;aw out of the county of Middle&s;ex. When we left the valley, we went up a high hill to the we&s;t, and left the delightful valley of Aranjuez. We went on for Madrid, twenty|one miles; but we &s;topped at Leganes to bait, the cu&s;tom of Spain. When we were on our way to Madrid, if we met a carriage going to Aranjuez, we were obliged to give way. We cro&s;&s;ed another branch of the ri|ver Tagus, and put up at the St. Seba&s;tian, an elegant hotel, the ma&s;ter of which was an Italian. Next day my ma&s;ter hired a coach for him&s;elf and two Engli&s;h gentle|men.
<PB N="363" REF="377">
The Earl of Grantham's chaplain accompanied them to &s;ee the King's palace, the armoury, and his cabinet of curio&s;ities. I went on behind the coach, and &s;aw every thing that was worth &s;eeing in Madrid. When we were looking out of the palace windows in Madrid, we &s;aw the E&s;curial, a palace twenty-one miles north from Ma|drid. At the &s;ame time we &s;aw the di&s;tant mountains covered with &s;now, though it was then the beginning of June. After viewing every thing worth &s;eeing, the gentlemen &s;topped at Lord Grantham's town hou&s;e. Sir John de&s;ired me to go home, as I had the key of the room where they were to dine, and get the table ready for dinner. I went, but lo&s;t my way. I was in the greate&s;t per|plexity of mind, as I had the key of all the things, and of the room, and I had forgot the name of the hotel. I walked up one &s;treet and down another; at la&s;t I remembered the name of the hotel. I went up to a Spaniard
<PB N="364" REF="378">
and a&s;ked him for the St. Seba&s;tian. He an&s;wered, I do not under&s;tand you, be|cau&s;e I did not know the name of the &s;treet. I a&s;ked for the hotel, but could not give the &s;treet. At la&s;t, I went up to a French gen|tleman, who put me right pre&s;ently, and I got home before Sir John and his company. Next day we &s;aw the grand proce&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as we &s;aw at Cadiz, but much grander. The &s;treet where the proce&s;&s;ion went through was covered with canva&s;s, fixed to the three pair of &s;tairs windows, in ca&s;e of rain; but it happened to be fine weather. Madrid is a fine city, in a beautiful country. Madrid is lighted up with gla&s;s lamps like London. In Madrid the women wear white veils. After being four nights in Madrid, we &s;et out for the E&s;curial. On our way we only &s;topped a few minutes at a watering hou&s;e, and arrived at the E&s;curial by noon; there we had time to &s;ee the palace and village. About two miles before you come to the
<PB N="365" REF="379">
E&s;curial, you a&s;cend, as the palace &s;tands on a fine height, the mo&s;t beautiful rural place in the world. The palace is one of the longe&s;t in Europe, in figure like a gridiron; the handle in a fine garden, and the part of the palace like the gridiron is a fine &s;quare where carriages drive, very much re&s;embling Holy-Rood-Hou&s;e, the royal palace in Scotland. We went to &s;ee the king's chapel, and the fine painting; one drew my ma&s;ter's atten|tion, and that was the conver&s;ion of Paul. The friars were at prayers when we were in the chapel, and were &s;urprized to hear me name all the paintings exactly. Next morn|ing we travelled through a country like a garden, till we began to a&s;cend the high mountains. We were to cro&s;s to get out of the province of New Ca&s;tile, into Old Ca&s;|tile. I got out of the coach to make it ea&s;ier for the mules. I was &s;ometimes half a mile before the mules, becau&s;e I went &s;traight forward. I had milk from the &s;hep|herds

out of a large horn; and I met Sir John at a corner of the road. Near the top of the mountains, we entered into a cloud, it was &s;o thick and dark. Sir John called me to come into the coach to give him the bark. When we left the mountains behind, we got into a fine country, and arrived at a large town called Idelfon&s;o in Old Ca&s;tile. Here we &s;topped all night on account of the beau|ty of the place. It is &s;ituated in a fine val|ley between the high mountains of Brides. Next morning we went to Segovia, a fine town, with fine hou&s;es. At night we went to St. Maria de la Nieve, in a fine well cul|tivated country, with many fine woods, and pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ome convents. Next day we dined at Olmedo, and arrived at night at Val|de&s;tillas. I took more delight in &s;eeing the north part of Spain than the &s;outh, becau&s;e it afforded &s;o many hills, valleys, rivers, and woods. Next morning we &s;et out for Val|ladolid, a great city, but poor buildings, with
<PB N="367" REF="381">
an old palace of the Kings of Spain, with a cathedral and fine paintings. We &s;topped to dinner, then &s;et out for Duenas. This part of Spain is barren, and the people poor, not hav|ing trade. Next morning we went to Torque|nado, and at night to Villadrigo. Next day to dinner at Quintanillaja, and at night to the large city of Burgos, the capital of Old Ca&s;tile. This city is very rich and grand. It &s;tands on the banks of the river Alen&ccedil;on, and here is a fine cathedral, with excellent paintings. Sir John &s;topped here two days, hecau&s;e he met &s;ome Engli&s;h gentlemen. We were there on the market day, which gave us an opportunity of &s;eeing more of the humour of the place. The country round is fine and well cultiva|ted. We left Burgos and travelled over the very high mountains of Bribie&s;ca, through bad roads. We had dinner at Bodilles, and at night arrived at Bribie&s;ca. Afterwards we had a beautiful country to go through, but bad roads to pa&s;s. As we were going
<PB N="368" REF="382">
along, I ob&s;erved a hou&s;e like Fullarton's Folly in Scotland. Sir John looked round, and &s;aid, I never &s;aw a finer &s;ight; &s;uch a fine country, and fine river. Sir, &s;aid I, there is a finer &s;ight in Scotland. He &s;aid, Where, for God's &s;ake? Sir, from the ca&s;tle of Stirling. If young noblemen and gentlemen would take notice of Great Britain and Ireland, before they went on their travels, it would make a good foundation for their remarks.&mdash;Next day we dined at Pancorva, and pur&s;ued our jour|ney through the mountainous country of Mi|rando, and through a great many woods. We had a guard with us for one &s;tage. All this time we were very happy with our coachman and po&s;tillion, and we had plenty of mu&s;ic and dancing. Although the harve&s;t was in when we left Cadiz, they were only weeding their fields of green corn in the north of Spain. We dined at Vittoria; whence we &s;et out for Mon|drogone. On this &s;tage we entered the great mountain of the Pyrenees, which runs from the Bay of Bi&s;cay to the Mediterranean &s;ea,
<PB N="369" REF="383">
and, upon an average, is fifty miles broad, and covered con&s;tantly with &s;now. On the &s;tage between Mirando and Victoria, we cro&s;&s;ed the river Ebro, and entered the pro|vince Bi&s;cay. When we entered fir&s;t be|tween two rocks, there was only room for the coach to pa&s;s. We were three days in pa&s;&s;ing the Pyrenees, the road &s;erpentined &s;o much, to get round the mountains. We &s;topped at Villafranca. Next day we dined at Tolo&s;a. It was very plea&s;ant travelling through the valleys to &s;ee the &s;now on the mountains, while the valley was as warm as France or Spain. We travelled by a river the whole day; and there were plenty of trees on the &s;ide of the mountains. At night we &s;topped at Ogarzin, the plea&s;ante&s;t place I ever &s;aw. At this town the valley was very narrow, and mountains very high, the &s;ides covered with che&s;nut trees. In pa&s;&s;ing the Pyrenees, we had the be&s;t white wine I ever drank. In the morning we left Ogar|zin,
<PB N="370" REF="384">
and went to the river Bida&s;&s;oa, which divides Spain and France. The river is deep, but not very broad. We cro&s;&s;ed over all at once in a ferry-boat, and we had our things taken to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e to be &s;earched. On the one &s;ide they &s;poke French, on the other &s;ide Spani&s;h. Here we entered Ga&s;cony, and dined at St. Jean de Luz.</P>
<P>Sir John and I began to &s;eparate dining or &s;leeping in one room together; and here I left my kitchen furniture behind, not having any more occa&s;ion for them at night. We &s;topped at Bayonet, a large trading city on the great river Adour. I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the people in Ga&s;cony: I thought I was in Scotland, for the people dre&s;s in the &s;ame manner, with &s;hort coats and blue bonnets, and there is not the lea&s;t difference in their behaviour. As Pro&s;illa, the coachma&s;ter, had fulfilled his engagements for his coach and mules, he was paid off. I was &s;orry to part
<PB N="371" REF="385">
with him and his nephew; and he was &s;orry to part with Sir John and me. Next day Sir John bought a French po&s;t-chai&s;e, and they both &s;aw us &s;et off po&s;t for Bourdeaux. We dined at a large town called Deux on the ri|ver Adour, and at night arrived at Le&s;peron. This country had a great many woods and bad roads. Next day to St. Julian, next day to E&s;cour&s;e, and &s;lept at Ca&s;tre&s;s; next day to Bourdeaux, and put up at the Hotel de Richelieu, near the grand promenade, and the new play-hou&s;e. As there were a great many Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h gentlemen here, Sir John &s;aid, he would &s;top. He ordered a chariot with a coachman and footman, and jaunted through the city of Bourdeaux, one of the fine&s;t places in France, for beauty and for trade. It is a great re&s;ort for company; it is above two miles long, on the river Garonne, on which you will &s;ee &s;hips of all countries. Mo&s;t of the country is vineyards, as it is the country where claret is made. After we had
<PB N="372" REF="386">
been there one week, the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hotel, her brother, a ma&s;ter &s;hoe-maker, and an Engli&s;h hou&s;e-keeper, a French valet, and I, made a party on a Sunday to go to the mi&s;|tre&s;s's brother, three miles down the river, on the other &s;ide, at Madam Reives's bro|ther's hou&s;e. As &s;oon as we were in the boat Madam Reives took a pack of cards out of her pocket to play. She de&s;ired me for her partner, I made many excu&s;es again&s;t it, but all would not do, as &s;he had &s;een me play before. I apologized, and in all my life I had never done &s;o before, nor never had done any thing on a Sunday that gave me &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s before; for I always re|garded the Sunday; but they were all Ro|man Catholics; dancing or gambling on Sunday, they think no harm. When we came to Madam Reives's brother's, we walk|ed in the vineyards, on the banks of the ri|ver. We ate grapes, drank wine, had fi&s;h of the river &s;tewed in wine, and in the even|ing
<PB N="373" REF="387">
we returned by water at &s;un&s;et. At this time, the Emperor of Germany was making the tour of France, accompanied by the Count of Provence, the King of France's brother, and many other noblemen. The day they arrived at Bourdeaux, two of the noblemen came to our hotel. Three days after, I was at the gate of the hotel at nine in the morn|ing, when I &s;aw the Emperor and all his at|tendants going to ma&s;s. I went directly without putting on my hat, and got into church. Thou&s;ands of people flocked in the &s;treets to &s;ee the Emperor. He did not &s;top long at ma&s;s. As he was coming out of church, he &s;poke to the Count de Provence, as he thought he would be ob&s;tructed getting out, the people thronged &s;o much about the church. The Emperor went out with one of his lords, and as the people knew neither of them, both of them went into the noble|man's chariot, and drove off. Soon after the Earl of Provence and the other lords came
<PB N="374" REF="388">
out and drove away. The Emperor's car|riage drove away empty. The people a&s;ked the coachman who was the Emperor. He &s;aid that he went away in the fir&s;t carriage, &s;o they were di&s;appointed. I got out of the crowd, came home, and called my ma&s;ter at ten o'clock, and I told him I had been at ma&s;s with the Emperor and the Count de Provence, and what I had &s;een. He &s;aid, I wi&s;h I had been there to &s;ee the Emperor, and the Earl of Provence. After we were two weeks at Bourdeaux, Sir John made a party to go to go to Bagneres, at the bottom of the Pyrenees. The party was my ma&s;ter, Edward Coke, E&s;q. Captain Fagan, in the French &s;ervice, belonging to a regiment of hor&s;e, and of the order of St. Louis; Cap|tain Woolley, an Iri&s;h gentleman, and Mr. Hooper, an American gentleman. In the middle of July we left Bourdeaux, and dined at Co&s;tre&s;s, and went at night to Langon, a fine town, in a fine country. Next to Marmonde,
<PB N="375" REF="389">
then to Tormaine, Aquillion, and Agen, po&s;t towns, and at night to Leirace. Next morn|ing we went to Leytaure, changed hor&s;es, then to Auch, and then at night to Tarble. This town is a fine large market town, in a fine country, &s;urrounded with vineyards, on a branch of the river Adour. Next day we arrived at Bagneres. The gentlemen went to hou&s;e-keeping; they had the Mayor's hou&s;e, they had a man cook, kitchen maid; and as the Mayor lived in the hou&s;e, his maid cleaned the rooms, and took care of her ma|&s;ter's things. As Mr. Coke's &s;ervant and I were Briti&s;h, we did the work one week, and the French &s;ervants another. Bagneres is like the German Spa, for company from all places. They drink the water, ride out, &s;ome on hor&s;eback, others in carriages meet to play cards, have balls, and there are fine walks round the town. It is a &s;weet place, for the waters of the river run through every hou&s;e in town; &s;o all filth is carried away. This
<PB N="376" REF="390">
place lies one hundred miles ea&s;t of Bay&s;met, at the bottom of the Pyrenees. The town is very hot, though when looking out of your windows you can &s;ee the &s;now on the top of the mountains. Sometimes the company dined in the wood, or in a grove. When they came to the place, &s;ome walked about, others played cards till dinner time, every one &s;peaking the French language.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, when Sir John was of age, he gave a dinner to the gentlemen and ladies at Bagnone, near fifty people up the valley, between the Pyrenees, at a village cal|led Compa. On both &s;ides, &s;ome of the moun|tains, like &s;ugar loaves, were two or three miles high, covered with &s;now, and below as hot as you can bear it. The dinner was fine and plenty of fine wines and card-playing; but, unluckily for Sir John, after dinner, when he went into the nece&s;&s;ary hou&s;e, he left his repeating watch behind him, a new gold
<PB N="377" REF="391">
one of the fir&s;t &s;ort. The watch and chain, &amp;c. was valued at one hundred guineas. En|quiry was made, but all to no purpo&s;e. A reward was offered to any per&s;on that would deliver it, but all in vain. Our gentlemen &s;topped here till the end of Augu&s;t, and then went to Barege, about fifteen miles further up among&s;t the Pyrenees. Bagnere is only on the &s;ide of the mountain. Barege is as much frequented as Bengeree is, like Bath and Bri&s;tol. The gentlemen left Barege after dinner, and were all night at Purre&s;elt, near leaving the mountains. Next day we dined at Louredes, a beautiful town among&s;t vine|yards. We cut the grapes off with our hangers as we were riding along; and late at night we came to Tarbe, a fine large market town. Next day was a great fair. The gen|tlemen &s;topped here one day, as Mr. Hooper and Captain Woolley were to part with my ma&s;ter, and Mr. Coke, and Captain Fagan. Next day after we went for Bourdeaux, and
<PB N="378" REF="392">
in two days arrived there. Sir John &s;topped one week at Bourdeaux, and &s;et out for Paris. We cro&s;&s;ed the great river Garonne at Bour|deaux, in a boat, and at the next &s;tage Cub|&s;ac, we cro&s;&s;ed another branch of the river in a ferry-boat, and went po&s;t to Molieu, then Barbe&s;cieux, through a fine wine country, after to Angouleme, then to Moli all night. In the morning we cro&s;&s;ed the river Cha|rente in a ferry-boat; as the road was good, and very good hor&s;es, we went on very quick. We went to Ruffee, to Viome, and to Poictiers; and at night we cro&s;&s;ed a branch of the ri|ver Loire, and &s;lept all night at the fine large town of Chatellrault, whence the Duke of Hamilton has his French dukedom. At this time there was a great many com|pany in town, and at our hotel, where we put up, and of cour&s;e I was at &s;upper with a great many &s;ervants. The cu&s;tom of the hotel was, the &s;ervants that came la&s;t &s;at lowe&s;t at table. When &s;upper was over, I
<PB N="379" REF="393">
took off my hat and put it before my face, and &s;aid grace, then cro&s;&s;ed my&s;elf and put my hat on again; took up the bread and ki&s;&s;ed it, and then put it on the table. All the &s;ervants looked at me, and they took off their hats out of complai&s;ance to me, and put them on again; for the French &s;ervants are very re&s;pectful to any thing religious. They a&s;ked me if my ma&s;ter was a Bi&s;hop. I &s;aid no, he was a gentleman on his travels. They &s;aid, from what country, pray Sir? From Scotland, gentlemen. My ma&s;ter is Sir John Stuart. His family is &s;prung from the kings of Scotland; by this they thought Sir John and I mu&s;t be very religious; for they &s;poke of King Charles the Fir&s;t lo&s;ing his life for religion.</P>
<P>We &s;et off next morning for St. Maure. On this &s;tage we cro&s;&s;ed another branch of the river Loire. From St. Maure we cro&s;&s;ed three branches of the Loire, next to Veue,
<PB N="380" REF="394">
then we went and dined at the city of <HI>Blair.</HI> After dinner to Bengeney, through a plea&s;ant country, and at night to Orleans city, a fine large and beautiful place, on the river Loire. Next morning early, we left the city of Or|leans and the river Loire behind us. Nothing remarkable happened, but we were pa&s;&s;ing through a fine country, with good entertain|ment. Our next po&s;t was Arteny, then to Etampes, then to dinner at Arpajon, and at night to Paris, and put up at the Hotel de Saxe Rue Fauxbourg St. Germaine. Next day Sir John had a large coachman and foot|man to vi&s;it his friends. He found a great many young gentlemen of his acquaintance, which induced him to &s;tay longer than he intended. We arrived in Paris about the end of September, and we &s;topped eight weeks at the Hotel de Saxe. He went to all public places, and he kept the fir&s;t company in Pa|ris; and we &s;ervants lived like princes. We left Paris on St. Andrew's-day, a day that
<PB N="381" REF="395">
is kept more holy in France than Sunday. We went po&s;t by Chantillie, Amiens, Affeville, and in two days arrived at Boulogne, at my ma&s;ter's uncle's hou&s;e, Mr. Seton was one of the fir&s;t men in the wine trade in the univer&s;e. Sir John &s;topped here three weeks. Boulogne is a plea&s;ant town on the &s;ea &s;ide, within two &s;tages of Calais, and in &s;ight of England, on the great po&s;t road from Calais to Paris. We went by &s;ea from Boulogne to Dover. Sir John left his French po&s;t-chai&s;e at Boulogne, and we arrived in London the fir&s;t day of January, 1778, at Mrs. Elliot's hou&s;e in Brewer-&s;treet, Golden-&s;quare. Sir John was in perfect health; he &s;topped in London one week; and as he was de&s;irous of &s;eeing his relations in Scotland, and having no further occa&s;ion for me, he paid me off. He de&s;ired me to &s;end his baggage by &s;ea, and he went with a gentleman in a po&s;t-chai&s;e to Allen|bank, in Berwick&s;hire, in Scotland: &s;o we parted, and I was out of place. I took things
<PB N="382" REF="396">
very ea&s;y, as it was a good time of the year to get one. I went after none but a place with a &s;ingle man, as I wanted for nothing. I had my own lodging, with my own fur|niture, and whether I was at home or abroad, I paid my good old landlady, a wi|dow woman; and &s;he made of it what &s;he could in my ab&s;ence; therefore &s;he took care of my goods. I dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner I went abroad. Having good cloaths, with rich ve&s;ts, I wore my hanger, a &s;ilk bag at my hair, and laced ruffles; but when I went after a place, I dre&s;&s;ed in the common way. If it rained, I wore my fine &s;ilk umbrella, then the people would call after me, What, Frenchman, why do not you get a coach? In particular the hackney coachmen and hackney chairmen would call after me; but I, knowing the men well, went &s;traight on, and took no notice. At this time there were no umbrellas worn in London, except in noble|men and gentlemen's hou&s;es; where, there
<PB N="383" REF="397">
was a large one hung in the hall, to hold over a lady or gentleman if it rained, be|tween the door and their carriage. I was going to dine in Norfolk-&s;treet, one Sunday. It rained, my &s;i&s;ter had hold of my arm, and I had the umbrella over our heads. In Tavi|&s;tock-&s;treet, we met &s;o many young men, calling after us <HI>Frenchman!</HI> take care of your umbrella. <HI>Frenchman,</HI> why do not you get a coach, Mon&s;ieur? My &s;i&s;ter was &s;o much a&s;hamed, that &s;he quitted my arm, and ran on before, but I &s;till took no notice but an|&s;wered in French or Spani&s;h that I did not under&s;tand what they &s;aid. I went on &s;o for three months, till they took no further no|tice of me, only, How do you do <HI>Frenchman?</HI> After this, the foreigners &s;eeing me with my umbrella, one after another u&s;ed theirs, then the Engli&s;h. Now it is become a great trade in London, and a very u&s;eful branch of bu&s;i|ne&s;s. When I went to a public hou&s;e where &s;ervants meet in the evenings. I was called
<PB N="384" REF="398">
by the name of <HI>Beau Macdonald,</HI> or the <HI>Scotch Frenchman.</HI> I went &s;ometimes to the Seven Stars, Eagle-&s;treet, Piccadilly, which is fre|quented only by foreigners. They a&s;ked me from what country? I &s;aid from Cadiz in Spain. You may be twenty years in London, and not meet with a Spani&s;h &s;ervant. In the month of March there was a hou&s;e warm|ing at Knights-bridge. A gentleman's &s;er|vant took a public-hou&s;e, and he a&s;ked his friends to come. There was a &s;upper and ball. Thirty men and twenty-two women came. I was one of the company, which was very genteel, from noblemen and gen|tlemen's hou&s;es of different countries. The ma&s;ter of the ceremonies was a Scotchman, who delighted more in that &s;tation than in the Prayer-Book. The evening was &s;pent very agreeably by the company at country dances, cards, and drinking. Supper was at eleven o'clock. After &s;upper the company came into the drawing-room and began again.
<PB N="385" REF="399">
As I had not danced in the evening, I a&s;ked the ladies if they would do me the honour to dance a minuet with me, as I had no partner. They all an&s;wered they could not dance a mi|nuet, till at la&s;t I came to the wife of a &s;er|jeant of the King's Body Guards, a genteel woman. She under&s;tood dancing well; &s;he untuckered the &s;kirts of her gown. I called for Mi&s;s Carmichael's minuet. I let the tune be played over once, that the gentle|woman might under&s;tand the minuet. While we &s;tood at the end of the room for the mi|nuet to begin, the company got up from their card-tables, and their drinking. As there had been no minuet before in the evening, they gave great attention. When we had danced the minuet, I a&s;ked the favour of the lady to dance a jig; &s;he an&s;wered &s;he would. She buttoned up the &s;kirts of her gown, and I called for Lady Kitty Car&s;tair's Reel. We both danced together in the form of the mi|nuet, though quick. When we were done,
<PB N="386" REF="400">
the company called <HI>encore, encore.</HI> I a&s;ked the lady if it was agreeable to dance again. She an&s;wered, Yes. Then, madam, chu&s;e your tune. She &s;aid, the &s;ame again. I thought with|in my&s;elf, what agreeable creatures tho&s;e wo|men are; they are not changeable; if they like a tune a man dances with them, they do not want to change from it. We went through our dance as before, and I treated her and the ladies with a bottle of &s;weet mountain. In this month of March, I cal|led at Lowe's Hotel, Covent-Garden. As I went in, the waiter told me, Macdonald, I was ju&s;t going to &s;end a porter for you. I have an excellent place for you. A gentleman here, going abroad; his name is James O'Neil, E&s;q. a very fine young man, in his twenty|fir&s;t year. His father is a man of great for|tune in Ireland. He &s;erved his time to the wine trade in Dublin; now he is going to the wine countries to make connections, and to know the cu&s;toms abroad. I heard him
<PB N="387" REF="401">
tell a gentleman, he would not have a foreign &s;ervant, becau&s;e &s;ometimes when they get what they can in England, they rob their ma&s;ters and leave them. Well, it is an old &s;aying, an Iri&s;h gentleman will not be im|po&s;ed upon. The waiter told Mr. O'Neil, the &s;ervant he mentioned to us is in the hall. Call him in. I went in. He a&s;ked me what countryman. I &s;aid a North Briton. After a&s;king me &s;ome que&s;tions, he hired me. After this Mr. O'Neil &s;topped at London two weeks to &s;ee the places in London, and din|ing at one place in the country, then at ano|ther; Richmond, Hampton Court, Wind&s;or, Shooter's-hill, &amp;c. Then we &s;et out po&s;t for Bath, put up at the Three Tuns, and &s;topped there two weeks; then my ma&s;ter told me to take two changes of linen with me, and order a po&s;t chai&s;e below: I want to go to &s;ee Bri&s;tol. We put up at Mrs. Perry's, Queen's-&s;quare; &s;topped here one day, and returned to Bath. Afterwards we &s;et out po&s;t for
<PB N="388" REF="402">
Wells, Bridgewater, Taunton, Tiverton, then to Exeter. Next day we &s;et out for Ply|mouth, and &s;topped a few days, and then went round for Falmouth. We waited for a fair wind only two days. There was a great many pa&s;&s;engers, Engli&s;h gentlemen and la|dies going to Li&s;bon for plea&s;ure, as well as their health; from England, Scotland, Ire|land, and Wales. We &s;ailed in the Expe|dition, Captain Robert&s;on, with a fair wind. We got to Li&s;bon in fourteen days. We &s;aw &s;everal &s;hips, but never hailed one, they not being near enough. Every thing was agree|able on the pa&s;&s;age, and the company very happy. There was a lady from Cornwall, with a beautiful daughter, about &s;ixteen, and her &s;on in a decline, about nineteen years old. The day we fir&s;t &s;aw the rock of Li&s;bon, the young gentleman died, his corp&s;e was carried on &s;hore, and buried in the Engli&s;h burying place. He was heir to a large e&s;tate in Corn|wall. When we arrived at Li&s;bon, the com|pany
<PB N="389" REF="403">
went to the Engli&s;h Hotel. My ma|&s;ter had the &s;ame equipage, man and hor&s;e, that Sir John Stuart had. We were in Li&s;|bon &s;ix weeks; then the company made a party, and went to Syntra, to the northward of the Tagus, near the &s;ea &s;ide, a plea&s;ant place. Here the company enjoyed them|&s;elves by going out an airing in view of the &s;ea and the rock of Li&s;bon. In a week we returned to Li&s;bon, and in two days bought our travelling bed and other uten&s;ils as before when with Sir John Stuart. I called my ma&s;|ter to &s;ee the different things, which &s;eemed &s;trange to him. He a&s;ked me, where my bed was? Sir, I have none; I take my chance. He hired a chai&s;e and two mules to carry the baggage, they were already at Aldea Gallega. We cro&s;&s;ed the Tagus and &s;topped there all night at the hou&s;e where I was at with Sir John. In the morning we &s;et out for Pe|goens, through a fine country, then to Ven|tas Nuevas. We &s;topped all night. I went
<PB N="390" REF="404">
a cocking. Mr. O'Neil was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the difference between Portugal and England, or Ireland. I ate with my ma&s;ter, and &s;lept in the &s;ame room, through Portugal and Spain, as I did with Sir John Stuart. We had the driver and the baggage man with the two mules, but no interpreter. Next day to Ventas Silveras, and dined at Montemor Novi, and at night to Arrazolas, a fine town in a beautiful country for wines, oranges, and lemons. In the town is a royal palace. Next morning to Evoramonte, a &s;mall town, and at night to Elvas, which is a &s;trong fortified town on the confines of Portugal. Next morning we &s;et out for Badajoz. On this &s;tage we left Portugal, and entered Spain. Badajoz is the capital of the province of E&s;tremadura, a very large &s;trong fortified city, where there are a great many troops. At leaving the city of Badajoz, we cro&s;&s;ed the river Gua|diana. Next we pa&s;&s;ed through Talavera; next through Lobon, and at night to Merida,

a fine city, with fine churches, and grand buildings, with very grand and genteel com|pany. As my ma&s;ter was of the church of Rome, we were very agreeable to the people, and they to us, as we travelled along. Next day we pa&s;&s;ed through Buixellanes and San Pedro, where we dined. Here we entered the province of New Ca&s;tile, a fine town; and at night to Mujadas. Next day to Puerto de Santa Cruz, and at night to Tra&s;illo. Here was one of the fine&s;t churches in Spain; a fine town, where we had good accommoda|tion. Next day we went to Serezejo, a fine town, with fine buildings. On this road the mountains were &s;o high, that we were obliged to get two oxen to help the hor&s;es over the mountains. We walked on foot. Next we came to Ca&s;as Del Puerto, then to Venta Nueva, a town with very fine buildings. We left this and cro&s;&s;ed the Tagus river, over which is a very fine bridge of twelve arches. We &s;topped all night at Almarez, where we
<PB N="392" REF="406">
had very good and civil accommodation. As my ma&s;ter &s;poke the Spani&s;h and French as well as Latin, and that, before he left Li&s;bon, he had a very rich Spani&s;h dre&s;s made, trimmed with gold, every one took him for a Spa|niard. If ever there was an angel of a man, he was one. He allowed the men their pro|vi&s;ion from his own good-nature. He never did any thing without &s;peaking to me for my advice; and where-ever there was mu&s;ic, at any of the &s;tages, he always paid them for playing, which made us always merry. I thought my life was heaven upon earth. Next morning we pa&s;&s;ed E&s;padanal, then Naval Moral Valparido, and dined at Calcada de Oropea; then through Toralca, and at night to Ventta de Peral Benegas, fine towns in a fine country, and the mo&s;t harmle&s;s people in the world. Next day we dined at the city of Talavera de Regna, a place of great trade. My ma&s;ter and I went to &s;ee all the churches, and a number of fine buildings; and we al&s;o
<PB N="393" REF="407">
went to &s;ee a great many manufactories, for which the place is famous. After dinner we pa&s;&s;ed through Venta Del Alverche, and at night to Bravo. Although the city of Toledo was out of our way, I had a great de&s;ire to go through it. I told my ma&s;ter, If you plea&s;e, Sir, to go by Toledo, it is one of the fine&s;t cities in Spain, and, going from thence to Ma|drid, you will &s;ee Aranjuez, where the King of Spain keeps his court part of the year; one of the fine&s;t places in Europe, Sir. He &s;aid, I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee Aranjuez; &s;o he de|&s;ired the po&s;tillion next morning to drive to Montalbar, where we dined, and at night to Toledo. This whole day we were going by the &s;ide of the river Tagus that wa&s;hes Madrid, Toledo, Aranjuez, and Li&s;bon; the plea&s;ante&s;t journey ever a man travelled. As we were in Toledo at four in the after|noon, Mr. O'Neil went to &s;ee the churches, and I with him. When I came back, I en|quired for Malilia, the girl that was there

la&s;t year. They told me &s;he was at her father's and went away with child to an Engli&s;hman, that was travelling the road with his ma&s;ter; and that as the &s;ervant's name was John, they call the child John England. I a&s;ked what her father was, they &s;aid he was a cooper, and cou&s;in to our ma&s;ter. I de&s;ired to be taken to her father's hou&s;e. They &s;aid, Sir, I &s;uppo&s;e you are the father of the boy. The landlord came out directly, and all the people looked at me, and &s;aid, this is the child's father, God help her, dear girl. I was taken to her father's hou&s;e, and when I entered the child was in the cradle a&s;leep. I took Ma|lilia in my arms, and ki&s;&s;ed her. She &s;aid, Mr. John, in Spani&s;h, and fell down dead, and lay for one hour. The hou&s;e filled in a few minutes with people, and I had her in my arms. When &s;he came to her&s;elf, &s;he took me round the neck, and fainted away again. She &s;oon recovered. My child's father! my dear child! He was born the fir&s;t of March,
<PB N="395" REF="409">
and is four months old. I took her to the hotel with me, and the child in her arms. An hundred people came to &s;ee us. I was &s;ati&s;|fied the child was my own, and that &s;he ne|ver had known any otherman. I a&s;ked her if &s;he would go to England with me: She &s;aid, with all her heart, and all her friends were agreeable, if I would marry her. I &s;ent for a prie&s;t, and was married directly. She was very merry. Next day a hundred people came to &s;ee us go away. She was eighteen years of age, and I thirty-eight. I hired a chai&s;e to take her to Aranjuez and Madrid, as I thought we &s;hould &s;tay &s;ome days there. We arrived at Aranjuez at din|ner, and put up at the hotel I was at with Sir John Stuart. As the King was at the E&s;curial, my ma&s;ter went to &s;ee what was worth &s;eeing, and &s;et out next day for Ma|drid, where we &s;topped two days. I made an agreement with the chai&s;e-driver to take my wife to Toledo, and then to the Engli&s;h
<PB N="396" REF="410">
hotel at Li&s;bon, and I &s;ent a letter to Mr. Dewar, the landlord of the &s;ame, to get her a pa&s;&s;age for England, and to come to me in London, to Berwick-&s;treet, Soho.</P>
<P>In France we di&s;charged our men and mules, and all our unnece&s;&s;ary luggage, and next day we &s;et out po&s;t for Bourdeaux, where we arrived the third day at the Engli&s;h hotel. My ma&s;ter liked Bourdeaux much. Finding a great many Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h gentlemen, he &s;topped three weeks. He hired a carriage and two &s;ervants. At the end of three weeks we &s;et off po&s;t for Paris, and arrived, at the end of one week, at the Hotel de Parc Royal, Rue Fauxbourg, St. Germaine. Here my ma&s;ter intended to &s;tay to amu&s;e him&s;elf. He got a chariot, and he gave the two &s;er|vants genteel liveries. My ma&s;ter was a very genteel young man, and hand&s;ome. He made a very good appearance wherever he went. On the &s;ixth day of November, in the morn|ing,
<PB N="397" REF="411">
he &s;aid to me, John, there is five Louis for you. Sir, what is this for? I give it, be|cau&s;e this is my birth-day. I am this day twenty-one years, and treat the coachman and flamack with what they like to drink. I will, Sir; and I wi&s;h you long life and pro&s;pe|rity, and I hope, Sir, you will have better luck than my la&s;t ma&s;ter, Sir John, had, for on the day he was of age, in the &s;outh of France, he lo&s;t a gold watch worth one hun|dred guineas. About the end of November we left Paris, to go to Bru&s;&s;els. We went to Chantillie, and &s;topped all night. Next morn|ing Mr. O'Neil went to &s;ee the Palace, the Toartains gardens, hot-hou&s;e, green-hou&s;e, and the &s;tables, the fir&s;t in the world. Next night we went to the city of Cambray, and next night to Mons, and next day to Bru&s;&s;els, and put up at the Engli&s;h hotel. Here was a great many Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h gentlemen, and here Mr. O'Neil kept his Chri&s;tmas. Bru&s;&s;els is
<PB N="398" REF="412">
one of the fine&s;t places in the world, and there are the fine&s;t churches. As it was the Chri&s;t|mas time, my ma&s;ter and I went to &s;ee the churches ornamented and lighted. After three weeks &s;tay here, we &s;et out for Ghent, and &s;topped all night, and next day we went to &s;ee the city and the churches, and the day following we went to Courtray, and next day to the city of Ypres, where we &s;topped one day, and next night to Dunkirk. My ma&s;ter &s;topped two days, as there were gentlemen he knew. The night before we left Dun|kirk, as I was putting Mr. O'Neil to bed, he &s;aid, I will not go by that poor place Gravelines, I will go by Boulogne. We went to Boulogne, and &s;topped two days, and then to Calais, and took our pa&s;&s;age for Dover, and arrived in London, at Lowe's Hotel, in January 1779. I went to my lodg|ings in Berwick-&s;treet to enquire if my wife and child were arrived from Toledo. When I went in, my landlady a&s;ked me how I did,
<PB N="399" REF="413">
and when the common compliments were over, I a&s;ked her if any one had called on me? She an&s;wered none, but there is a foreign let|ter here for you four months. When I received the letter I trembled, le&s;t &s;ome accident had happened to my wife and child; but my fears were &s;oon over, when I opened the letter and read, <LETTER>
<P>"My dear hu&s;band, you will be &s;ur|prized on your arrival in London, when you do not find me and your dear &s;on at your lodgings at Mrs. White's. We are all well, I prai&s;e the great God, but when I came to my father's door with the return chai&s;e, when the man told me to be ready by four next morning, my mother was like a di&s;tract|ed woman, and &s;aid, if my only child leaves me, I certainly cannot live one week; &s;o I was in great di&s;tre&s;s how to determine. My father came in, and between us he was very unea&s;y; &s;o he went for his cou&s;in, Mr. Lo|garo, the ma&s;ter of the Hotel de Naples, where I fir&s;t &s;aw you; &s;o when he came, my

father a&s;ked his opinion, how his daughter &s;hould do, concerning going to London. If my daughter goes, I &s;hall lo&s;e my wife, and I &s;hould be &s;orry never to &s;ee my daughter again. Now cou&s;in, give me your advice. I am &s;orry to &s;ee the di&s;tre&s;s you are in, I would have Malilia to &s;top with her mother, and I believe her hu&s;band is a man of good character, by what I have &s;een of his beha|viour; and by his being here twice with gen|tlemen of fortune. Write to him the di&s;tre&s;s your wife is in to part with her daughter, and if he would come to Toledo, we can do better for him than his living in &s;ervice, and going round the country; &s;o my dear hu&s;|band, if you will be conde&s;cending to this reque&s;t, we &s;hall be all happy. If you do not chu&s;e to come, let me know your commands, and I will fulfill them if it was at the peril of my life: let me have an an&s;wer as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.

<P>When I came back to the hotel, my ma|&s;ter's father had ju&s;t arrived from Dublin to receive his &s;on; he &s;aid to me, Are you my &s;on's &s;ervant? Sir, I am Mr. O'Neil's &s;ervant, he is gone out, and he will be in &s;oon. Next day I determined in my own mind what to do. After the gentlemen were dre&s;&s;ed, I went down to Wapping to enquire if there was any &s;hip going to Spain. At the St. An|drew's, I found a &s;hip was to &s;ail in three weeks for Bilboa in the province of Bi&s;cay, in the
<PB N="402" REF="416">
north of Spain. I &s;aid that would an&s;wer my purpo&s;e; &s;o I took my pa&s;&s;age. Captain Jen|kins was the Captain's name. After one week in town, the gentlemen were pre|paring to &s;et off for Ireland. One morning my ma&s;ter a&s;ked if I would go to Ireland with him. I thanked him; and I an&s;wered, I am going to Spain with a gentleman, and as your father has two &s;ervants here, you can do without me: the butler will take care of your things, and I am much obliged to you for all favours. I never enjoyed more happine&s;s than with you. My ma&s;ter paid me off, and his father &s;ent the butler for me to come into the parlour, and he made me a pre&s;ent of a twenty pound bank note, and next day they &s;et off for Dublin. I &s;old all my things off, and made ready to take my pa&s;&s;age to Bilboa. We all got on board, and, in one month from the Thames, we arrived at Bilboa. As we were preparing to go on &s;hore, I looked back and &s;aid to my&s;elf, fare|well
<PB N="403" REF="417">
Great Britain and Ireland, if I &s;hould or &s;hould not &s;ee you again. I &s;topped at Bilboa one day. I found &s;everal people go|ing to Burgos city, &s;ome merchants and &s;ome &s;eafaring people, to &s;ee their relations. I had one mule to ride, and another for my baggage, and for the man to ride that was to bring back the mules. When we left Bil|boa two &s;tages, we came into a road I had travelled twice before. The people knew me on the road. The company were all very civil; therefore we travelled with great plea|&s;ure. In three days we arrived at Burgos, and &s;topped at our old hou&s;e. Here all the company left us, but one going to Segovia. We had fre&s;h mules as before, and arrived in four days. Here I waited one day to have an opportunity to be one in a return chai&s;e to Madrid, which was rather more agree|able to ride, than on a mule. We &s;et out three of us in the chai&s;e, and every thing was very agreeable. We walked on foot
<PB N="404" REF="418">
over the mountains and hills. We came to Madrid in three days, where I &s;topped two nights with a relation of my wife's: then I &s;et off for Toledo, by a return coach. We went through Aranjuez, and arrived at To|ledo at my father-in-law's. My wife was brought to bed, in a week after, of another boy. I &s;aid to my&s;elf, the Macdonalds grow in Spain. My wife was overjoyed to &s;ee me, and I was glad to &s;ee my wife and children. My wife's father and mother, and Mr. Lo|garo, were very glad to &s;ee me come among&s;t them. Numbers of their friends came to &s;ee me. Next day I went to Mr. Logaro's, at the Hotel de Naples, and there I was em|ployed to my &s;atisfaction. So now I end the hi&s;tory of my travels.</P>
