<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be ea&s;ily perceiv'd, why no Ad|dre&s;s, by way of <HI>Dedication,</HI> cou'd be proper to this Poem: Yet, the Ver&s;es ought perhaps to have been offer'd, before print|ed, to the View of One Great Family (le&s;t, among Ideas, of &s;o complicated a Variety, there &s;hou'd be &s;ome, wherewith it might not, as to Point of Delicacy, have been found eligible to a&s;&s;ociate Names, of &s;uch &s;incere Di&s;tinction and Importance). But the Writer recollected, that the mere Omi&s;&s;ion of an Act of Cere|mony cou'd not, equitably, be complain'd of, in a Poem where he has not arrogated, <HI>to Him&s;elf,</HI> the Freedom to give PRAISE, or CENSURE: All, that points at either One or Other, being narrative Recital only; and That, too, from the Voices of &s;uch Speakers, as the Public daily <HI>hears,</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="2" REF="3">
more, upon both Subjects, than they are repre&s;ented in this Place, as uttering.</P>
<P>As to the general Di&s;po&s;ition of the Purpo&s;e, if Any too bold Strokes of Liberty &s;hou'd chance to be &s;u&s;pected in it, let it be remember'd in the Writer's Favour, that he is no better than an empty <HI>Vi&s;ionary!</HI> And This is not the fir&s;t Time, that a Man, in a Dream, has been a very <HI>impertinent Fellow,</HI> who, in his waking Intervals, has kept within the Bounds of due <HI>Decorum.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning LUXURY e&s;pecially, none ought to make the Mu&s;e accountable for what &s;he prattles in her <HI>Sleep:</HI> Since 'tis about a Power &s;he never corre&s;ponds with, <HI>but in Slumber.</HI> And, if TRADE is touchy, and won't bear to have it credited, that <HI>Daughters</HI> come by means of <HI>Mothers,&mdash;</HI>who could &s;hun the Hazard of offending &s;uch a choleric Petulance?&mdash;The Wri|ter had no Licence to re&s;train, or ca|&s;trate, Sentiments he but <HI>reports,</HI> from Per&s;onages, to whome his Country owes a Reverence that forbids the Boldne&s;s of curtailing their Ideas.&mdash;Neither has he given the captious <HI>Coquette</HI> above-nam'd
<PB N="3" REF="4">
the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion of Offence, without Hard-&s;training and Partiality; for, Who can look upon it as an Undervaluing of <HI>Trade,</HI> that &s;he is repre&s;ented as not over|much di&s;pos'd to <HI>carry Arms</HI> Her&s;elf; nor over-fond, indeed, of Tho&s;e <HI>&s;he pays for carrying them?&mdash;</HI>Authorities enough might probably be found, to prove plain Truth no Slander. But he rather pleads the Merit of that prophe&s;ied <HI>Expedient,</HI> toward the End of the Vth Canto, for a perfect Reconciliation between the Drum, and Warehou&s;e.&mdash;If, notwith&s;tanding This, the waking Poet mu&s;t be charg'd with the Vagaries of his dreaming Mu&s;e, He can but borrow Comfort from this tit-for-tat Reflection:&mdash;That, &s;ince Trade is naturally di&s;pos'd to think, with Dulne&s;s and Con|tempt, of <HI>Poetry,</HI> the Poet in his Turn, may, by Right of Equivalent, a&s;&s;ume the &s;ame dull Privilege; and prate, as fooli&s;hly, of <HI>Traffick.</HI></P>
<P>To pa&s;s, at once, from Poetry,&mdash;to Pro&s;e, and Truth, and &s;erious <HI>Hi&s;tory:&mdash;</HI>The great, and nobly-judging, Lady, to whome, in the VIth Canto, an Advice of no &s;mall Con|&s;equence
<PB N="4" REF="5">
is offer'd, by a bold, tho' <HI>naked,</HI> Friend, (of whome &s;he never yet was known to be a&s;ham'd, however bare, and out of Fa&s;hion, &s;he approach'd her) will reflect, with &s;ome Attention, on the Pro|po&s;ition; after hearing what <HI>Foundation</HI> It was grounded on.</P>
<P>About the Year 1735, a private Per&s;on, not worth <HI>naming,</HI> but an ardent Lover of his Country's Reputation, became dif|po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a mi&s;taken Notion, (which had been at fir&s;t imbib'd by Conver&s;ation with the <HI>Prejudic'd,</HI> but gradually con|firm'd and heighten'd, by much Reading, Speculation, and Reflection, upon military Subjects) that the mo&s;t celebrated <HI>Engli&s;h Conqueror,</HI> of this la&s;t Age, (It might, I think, be added, without Flattery, above Any, of the Former) was not <HI>pre-medi|tatively,</HI> and by Force of his &s;uperior Skill, the Author of his own unprecedented Vi|ctories.&mdash;The Mi&s;taker grounded his Con|clu&s;ion on that Great General's <HI>Letters,</HI> written from the Fields of Battle, with the fir&s;t Accounts of his Succe&s;&s;es.&mdash;It is vi&s;i|ble beyond Di&s;pute, that, <HI>there,</HI> one meets
<PB REF="6">
with none of tho&s;e <HI>de&s;criptive</HI> and <HI>expla|natory</HI> Circum&s;tances, whereby the skilful Captains, of all Ages, took &s;uch cautio|nary Care to guard again&s;t unju&s;t Impre&s;|&s;ions of their Conduct; by unfolding it, in Plan, in Progre&s;s, and Accompli&s;hment: that, not their <HI>Fortune</HI> only, but their Fore|&s;ight, and Superiority of Genius, might be noted, in their Victories. It is hence, that in &s;o many of the Antient's, and in &s;ome great <HI>Modern's,</HI> written Narratives, we <HI>&s;ee,</HI> and under&s;tand, minutely, the whole Ground-plots, Di&s;po&s;itions, Oppo|&s;itions, and clear <HI>Out-break,</HI> of the Acti|ons: Not in their bald <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> alone; but with their previous Motives, their impend|ing Agitations, and eventual Over-balance, and Conclu&s;ion: Whereas, from all the publi&s;h'd Letters of our more than equal Executer of his own unequall'd Purpo&s;es, we gather nothing further, than that the Army He commanded was triumphant; and that He &s;eems to think each Leader, in it, more de&s;erving his Remark, than the Elu|cidation of his own De&s;igns, in their reported Execution.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
In a Vi&s;it made, about the Time ju&s;t mention'd, to another <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> General, a Noble Lord, &s;ince dead, at a &s;mall Gar|den Seat of his, near <HI>London,</HI> The&s;e Ob|&s;ervations were inlarg'd upon, (as they had often been to others) in a Conver&s;ation on the military Character of our great Fa|vourite of Fortune: whome, it has been thought, the Lord here meant had, for|merly, regarded with &s;ome Rival Pangs of Emulation. It were therefore an ungene|rous Coldne&s;s to his Memory, to conceal the noble Sentiments wherewith he clos'd the Conver&s;ation on this Subject!&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You have (&s;aid he) mi&s;under&s;tood His Cha|racter, and done it the &s;ame <HI>Wrong,</HI> that many Thou&s;ands do, and will con|tinue to do, from but the natural Con|&s;equence of his &s;incere and mode&s;t <HI>Ne|gligence of O&s;tentation.&mdash;</HI>He thought it, equally, His Duty to &s;ubdue the Enemy, and His own Sen&s;ibility of <HI>Triumph for &s;ubduing him.&mdash;</HI>He made, I think, but <HI>one</HI> Mi&s;take in his Field Conduct: But <HI>That</HI> was a Mi&s;take of &s;uch unlucky Con&s;equence, that It has been able to
<PB N="7" REF="8">
do more, <HI>again&s;t Him&s;elf,</HI> than Ten <HI>French Armies</HI> cou'd: for It ob&s;cures (you &s;ee) the Lu&s;tre of his Genius.&mdash;He tru&s;ted <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> for Explanations, which, He &s;hou'd have known, It cou'd not make (but in a lame and &s;uperficial manner) for want of Lights, which He alone had Power to furni&s;h, who was the only Per&s;on dis-inclinable to <HI>wi&s;h</HI> 'em furni&s;h'd."</Q></P>
<P>The Impre&s;&s;ion which this truly noble An&s;wer made, and the Reflections which It gave Occa&s;ion to, have often, <HI>&s;ince,</HI> pre|&s;ented to Imagination as a <HI>National</HI> Mi&s;|fortune, the Po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ome de&s;tructive Accident, to tho&s;e invaluable Original Pa|pers, which contain ('tis &s;aid) &s;ufficient Matter, in His Family's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to im|mortalize, as well That Great Man's <HI>Tem|per, Wi&s;dom, Suavity, Skill,</HI> MODES, and MEANS, of Conque&s;t, as the Reputation merely, of the Victories them&s;elves.&mdash;The <HI>La&s;t,</HI> it mu&s;t be own'd, is <HI>Glory:</HI> But it is a Glory of a barren and unpropagative Species: 'Tis the Glory of a <HI>Nimrod,</HI> a <HI>Se&s;o|&s;tris, Hercules, Arthur,</HI> and <HI>Pendragon:</HI> Names, of aweful Cloudine&s;sl but uneffectual
<PB N="8" REF="9">
Admiration!&mdash;becau&s;e heard of, more than <HI>&s;hown:&mdash;</HI>Not Lights, of Living <HI>Hi&s;tory;</HI> by who&s;e Help, the <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> and the <HI>Alexan|ders</HI> are not only, in Them&s;elves, immor|tal; but by their Force of Emulative In|&s;piration, have been, are, and will continue to the End of Time, the military <HI>Fathers,</HI> of new Sons of Glory, in all Nations, and throughout all Ages.</P>
<P>Who, therefore, cou'd too much lament an Accident of &s;uch &s;evere Importance, &s;hou'd it happen to the mention'd Papers, before That glorious <HI>U&s;e</HI> has been drawn from them, which is hinted in the Clo&s;e of the la&s;t Canto? Where that the Writer may not &s;eem impertinent, he has, here, a&s;&s;ign'd his <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> for conceiving it both a Dome&s;tic, and a Public Duty, on the Care of That illu&s;trious Conqueror's <HI>Re|pre&s;entatives.&mdash;</HI>But where the Hand is to be found, in all Points, equal to an Undertaking of &s;uch arduous Difficulty, is a Wi&s;h, that may be added to the Li&s;t of tho&s;e <HI>De&s;ide|rata,</HI> rather hinted at, than hop'd for, by the bolde&s;t Enterprizers, in the Common|wealth of Learning!</P>
