<HEAD>EPISTLE DEDICATORY. To the Hon. THO. LYTTLETON, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I would not in&s;ult your &s;ingular countenance with any thing like the appearance of a blu&s;h, I inform you that the following pages are not &s;acrificed to you as a compliment, but entirely due to you as a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed character. The po&s;ition, I believe, will &s;tand uncontro|verted, that there is not another man &s;o circum&s;tanced in the three kingdoms, on whom they would not &s;it aukward. What|ever con&s;equences we derive from an ef|fect, the primary cau&s;e &s;hould neither be neglected, nor forgotten. Immortal deeds, I own, have been atchieved by the execu|tive &s;inews of military veterans; but an acqui&s;ition of empire or honours, we rather owe to the wi&s;dom of the <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> than the mechanical prowe&s;s of the Troops.</P>
<P>The actions of your life, previous to the AFFRAY in point, have given you that rank in the Annals of <HI>Modern</HI> HEROISM, which your general&s;hip, had it been for|tunate in this in&s;tance, could &s;carcely ele|vate.</P>
<P>Human policy, however circum&s;pect, is &s;ubject to di&s;a&s;ters; and, therefore, we
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
wonder not, that this your la&s;t undertaking, although truly meritorious and momentous, has fatally mi&s;carried. But I am no mer|cenary &s;ycophant, and can therefore acco&s;t the great man with hone&s;t panegyric, tho' &s;ucce&s;s keep not equal pace with his merits. Be it my bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore, in this offering, to proclaim,&mdash;<HI>That where|ever</HI> LYTTLETON <HI>the</HI> II. d <HI>failed, it was neither from ignorance nor inattention, but &s;ome over-ruling nece&s;&s;ity.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I have the vanity to imagine, that the&s;e &s;heets will find their way to all tho&s;e va|rious places on the continent, which, ha|ving once known you, will eagerly &s;natch the future anecdotes of a man, rendered a glaring phaenomenon throughout Europe. The &s;hades of <HI>Hagley</HI> I could wi&s;h &s;acred from their approach: For the mu&s;es will fly aba&s;hed their wonted groves;&mdash;the venerable and noble Peer mu&s;t weep blood at that unnatural portrait, where the <HI>Pro|digal</HI> in&s;ultingly refu&s;es the repeated offers of forgivene&s;s, and the virtuous robes of re&s;toration&mdash;in&s;olently approaching his aged &s;ire, with the tattered garb of every &s;tudied, and po&s;&s;ible deformity.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>THE VAUXHALL AFFRAY; OR, MACARONIES DEFEATED.</HEAD>
<P>THE following paragraph appearing in the MORNING CHRONICLE of <HI>Tue&s;day, July</HI> 27, opened the literary campaign, in which the Maca|roni forces have &s;o fatally &s;uffered.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THAT the public may not be mis-informed by the news collectors of an affray and its con&s;equences, which happened at <HI>Vauxhall</HI> la&s;t <HI>Friday</HI> night, the following is declared to be the truth of the whole.&mdash;Mrs. <HI>Hartley,</HI> the celebrated actre&s;s, being in com|pany with others, among whom was the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> and Mr. <HI>Colman,</HI> was put out of countenance, by what &s;he deemed the impudent looks of four or five gentlemen, who purpo&s;ely placed them&s;elves di|rectly oppo&s;ite to her, which obliged her to appeal to Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> on the occa&s;ion, who, ob&s;erving as &s;he did, aro&s;e and &s;eated him&s;elf between her and the&s;e rude-looking gentlemen, who taking offence at this,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
got up one by one, and reconnoitred him with all po&s;&s;ible contempt, telling him, the &s;aid <HI>Bate,</HI> that he looked like a &s;tout, tight-made fellow, and capa|ble, no doubt, of brui&s;ing; to which Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> re|plied, They were four impertinent puppies, and could not be gentlemen for their behaviour to Mrs. <HI>Hartley,</HI> &amp;c. This brought on a general di&s;pute, which was divided into <HI>three acts,</HI> till at la&s;t a gentleman, one Captain <HI>Crofts,</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> and a&s;ked him, Whether he meant any thing again&s;t him? who was an&s;wered, No: however, Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> perhaps imprudently, made him&s;elf a principal with the re&s;t, and after much ill language had pa&s;&s;ed, brought upon him&s;elf an expre&s;&s;ion of anger from Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> that he would wring him by the no&s;e: addre&s;&s;es were then given; very &s;currilous language was received by Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> afterwards in the Gardens, a challenge was &s;ent to him the next morning, and an appointment made in the afternoon at the Turk's Head Coffee-hou&s;e, Strand, where Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> with a friend, Mr. <HI>Dawes,</HI> waited with punctuality for near an hour, when Captain <HI>Crofts,</HI> in company with the honourable Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> came in: a &s;hort recapitulation began between Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> and Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> who were interrupted by Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> as &s;econd to the latter, by de&s;iring that a cri&s;is &s;hould be made without words; that Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> &s;hould a&s;k the Captain's pardon in the papers, or name his weapon, and go with him in half an hour. Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> in a very manly way, refu&s;ed begging par|don, where no offence was given; but after expatiat|ing on the impropriety of his deciding the difference as a clergyman in a military manner, waved a re|membrance of his profe&s;&s;ion in defence of his honour, and agreed to adjourn with Captain <HI>Crofts,</HI> to &s;uch
<PB N="7" REF="6">
place as &s;hould be appointed by the &s;econds, Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> for Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> for the Captain; who, after exerting every thing in their power to prevent any ill con&s;equences, reduced the cau&s;es of quarrel and defence to writing, the better to un|der&s;tand what ground they were to &s;tand upon, as friends to the combatants, Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> being the whole time as impatient for deci&s;ion as any man living, who had conceived him&s;elf injured; but ju&s;t as Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> were going out to chu&s;e their pi&s;tols, the Hon. Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> broke in with apparent anger, and demanded &s;atisfaction of Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> for his friend Capt. <HI>Miles;</HI> but Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> remon&s;trated with him on the great in|con&s;i&s;tency of giving that &s;atisfaction, when Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> and Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> were then going out; yet he in&s;i&s;ted on his friend's having &s;atisfaction fir&s;t; to which Capt <HI>Crofts,</HI> replied, in a way that did him honour, that he was highly offended at the mode of Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI>'s calling on Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> after they had agreed to go out on one and the &s;ame quarrel, and &s;aid that he never under&s;tood that one man was bound to fight a whole company, where the &s;up|po&s;ed offence was given in gro&s;s, and not in par|ticular. Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> however continued his an|ger, &s;aying that his friend could not wait, and he was determined Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> &s;hould not go out with Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> till his affair was &s;ettled. From this circum&s;tance, Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> then thinking, from the particulars they had heard on both &s;ides, a trifling acknowledgment that each was wrong, would be be&s;t, recommended it to the parties, who, with &s;ome difficulty complied, and were made friends. Thus ended matters relative to Capt. <HI>Crofts;</HI> and with re&s;pect to Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
he declared, that had Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> and their &s;econds, Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> gone out, he would have prevented a duel, by putting the former under an arre&s;t. The former matter be|ing thus &s;ettled, Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> to introduce his friend, who he alledged was in|jured. He an&s;wered, that it would be better with|out, for that he was a hot-headed man, and might come to blows without ceremony. Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> however, in&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing him, ob&s;erving that he could not receive any violence from him, being con|&s;cious he had never offended him. On being intro|duced, he &s;aid, unle&s;s Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> would box him, he would beat him in every public place he met him. Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> then &s;aid, if he did, he would defend him&s;elf; for though he was capable of boxing, he never cho&s;e to decide any differences that way, but with tho&s;e from whom he could have no other &s;atis|faction; &s;till, as Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> triumphed in this refu&s;al, Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> with very great reluctance, con|&s;ented to meet him on his own terms, and accord|ingly a long room was fixed on, and Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> and Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> were to &s;econd the brui&s;ers, who immediately prepared them&s;elves for battle, in the pre&s;ence of Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI> and ano|ther. At fir&s;t, the advantage &s;eemed again&s;t Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> but a fair &s;et-to for about twenty minutes, convinced the company (but particularly Capt. <HI>Miles</HI>) that Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> though inferior in &s;ize, was victorious, who never received one blow that he felt. Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> was &s;ent home in a coach, with his face a perfect jelly, and Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> was invited to dine with the Hon. Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> on the morrow, as a proof of the applau&s;e he highly merited. A greater in&s;tance of true courage never
<PB N="9" REF="8">
appeared in man, than in Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> who ac|cording to the proverb, <HI>etiam quos contra &s;tatuit equos placato&s;que demi&s;it,</HI> enforced the applau&s;e of his ad|ver&s;aries."</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHOULD hold it an in&s;ult to the world, if this public appeal on a late di&s;pute, was grounded &s;imply on injuries I had received individually. So|ciety at large is however &s;o far connected with it, as to render it a matter of &s;ome importance; a mi&s;|repre&s;entation of facts cannot therefore be permitted, without a manife&s;t partiality to that indecorum my &s;ituation compelled me to correct.</P>
<P>There will not be wanting tho&s;e, even among&s;t my own fraternity, rigid enough to cen&s;ure my con|duct in a <HI>profe&s;&s;ional</HI> point of view, however com|mendable it may appear to them in any other. For the&s;e I have no other an&s;wer, than&mdash;<HI>I was neither born a Philo&s;opher&mdash;nor bred a Phari&s;ee.</HI> The candid however, from &s;imilar feelings with my own, will acknowledge, that during the outrage I complain of, the formalities of my profe&s;&s;ion might &s;lumber, without any glaring inju&s;tice to decency, or religion.&mdash;I mean no contempt to the natural laws of gallantry, when waving their &s;anction I appeal to the more &s;erious one of humanity, where an helple&s;s

<HEAD>The CASE.</HEAD>
<P>BEING at <HI>Vauxhall Gardens</HI> on Friday evening la&s;t, I &s;aw Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI> (in company with Mr. <HI>Hartley,</HI> Mr. <HI>Colman,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Tateham</HI>) &s;eated on a bench, not very far di&s;tant from the orche&s;tra. Hav|ing the plea&s;ure of her acquaintance, I joined the party and their conver&s;ation; when we pre&s;ently ob|&s;erved two gentlemen pa&s;s by, and look at her in a manner not altogether genteel; however, as cu&s;tom has in &s;ome mea&s;ure ridiculou&s;ly indulged our fine gentlemen in the&s;e familiarities <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> little or no notice was taken of it. Not &s;atisfied with this in|dulgence, the&s;e gentlemen pre&s;ently returned, with two or three others of a military <HI>appearance,</HI> who all &s;eated them&s;elves at a table directly oppo&s;ite to her, and began an attack in form, re&s;olutely determined to &s;tare her out of countenance. Situated in the middle of her company, &s;he bore this treatment for &s;ome minutes, before &s;he even complained to Mr. <HI>Hartley</HI> of her di&s;tre&s;s. Imagining that their triumph was near complete, he begged her to continue her &s;eat, till the conclu&s;ion of the Cantata then &s;inging, after which we would all retire. The&s;e gallant heroes however &s;till continuing the &s;iege, &s;he found her|&s;elf under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of addre&s;&s;ing her friends generally, telling us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That the behaviour of the&s;e Gentlemen was &s;o uncommonly rude, &s;he could bear it no longer.</HI>"</Q> On this I turned my head, and di&s;covered four of the&s;e pretty beings &s;taring at her
<PB N="11" REF="10">
with that kind of <HI>petit maitre</HI> audacity, which no language, but the modern French, can po&s;&s;ibly de|&s;cribe! and triumphing over tho&s;e female di&s;tre&s;&s;es which their prowe&s;s had nobly occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>To be a &s;ilent &s;pectator of &s;uch in&s;olence, would be tacitly to countenance it; loudly therefore, in order that they might hear it, I ob&s;erved to her, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I begged &s;he would not be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, as I would prevent any future in&s;ult of that nature."</Q>&mdash;In con&s;equence of which, I immediately placed my|&s;elf on a &s;eat directly between them and Mrs. <HI>Hartley.</HI> This was an intimation, that their behaviour was generally remarked; and I expected to find it at lea&s;t productive of the end intended; in&s;tead of which, I became now the &s;ubject of their loud hor&s;e|laughs and wi&s;e remarks. Thus unplea&s;antly cir|cum&s;tanced, I thought it better to face the&s;e de&s;pera|does, and therefore turned about and looked them, in my turn, full in the face; in con&s;equence of which, &s;ome di&s;tortions of features, I believe, pa&s;&s;ed on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Hartley,</HI> during this latter tran&s;action, ro&s;e up, and made for the walk; ob&s;erving which, I followed her, with the re&s;t of the company, fir&s;t ju&s;tly remarking as I quitted the &s;cene, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>that they were four impertinent puppies.</HI>"</Q> A gentleman in|&s;tantly followed me, whom I afterwards found to be Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> of Burgoyne's light dragoons, and a&s;ked me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Whether I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in that &s;peech to him?</HI>"</Q>&mdash;To which I replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Certainly not; as I did not recollect to have &s;een him in the party.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;Not &s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, he again demanded, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Whether I called him a puppy?</HI>"</Q>&mdash;To which I rejoin|ed as before, adding however, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That the only way to</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<HI>be perfectly convinced in this particular, was to tell me whether he was one of the four, or more, who formed the party, and then the application would come home; for that I &s;aid, and &s;till per&s;i&s;ted,&mdash;the Gentlemen, who &s;o meanly, and &s;candalou&s;ly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the Lady with whom I was in company, were four dirty, impertinent puppies.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>After this an&s;wer, Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> ob&s;erved, <HI>that I look'd very big upon the occa&s;ion,</HI>&mdash;&s;urveyed me, with a &s;upercilious kind of air from head to foot, and then remarked, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>You are indeed a good tight fellow, and there|fore mean to intimidate me I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e you are a boxer.</HI>"</Q> To this he received for reply, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>that box|ing was by no means my plan; however, as he &s;eemed determined not to be &s;atisfied, but continued to follow me, if he &s;poke three more impertinent words to me, I would wring his no&s;e off his face.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;On this he demanded my name and addre&s;s, which was in&s;tantly given him; I then drew off to my company, imagining that the affair would at lea&s;t &s;tand peaceably over till the morrow.</P>
<P>Previous to our leaving the Gardens, which we intended to do immediately, we were under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of walking round, in &s;earch of one of our com|pany; when at the further end of the walk, we di&s;|covered our former a&s;&s;ailants, now made doubly for|midable by a con&s;iderable augmentation.&mdash;No &s;ooner did we approach, than they began a fre&s;h attack with redoubled in&s;olence, interlarding their loud &s;allies of plea&s;antry, with <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Twig the Curate,</HI> &amp;c."</Q> Sub|mitting to this as long as human nature could do, at la&s;t I &s;topp'd &s;hort, with a view of knocking down the fir&s;t man that in&s;ulted me; when Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> touched me on the &s;houlder, called me by name, and
<PB N="13" REF="12">
begged to &s;peak another word with me, which I com|plied with, by going back with him; he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he had forgotten my addre&s;s, which was the cau&s;e of this &s;econd application on that &s;ubject."</Q> I immediately told him again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No. 17, <HI>Clifford's-Inn;</HI> but de&s;ired that he would now make &s;ure of it, by getting pen and ink from one of the waiters, and take it down;"</Q> which he did accordingly.</P>
<P>During this tran&s;action, a little effeminate being, whom I afterwards found to be a Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI> came up to me, dre&s;&s;ed <HI>a la Macaroni,</HI> and impertinently a&s;ked me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whether any man had not a right to look at a fine woman?"</Q> After getting over my fir&s;t &s;urprize at this wanton interference of a man, who was not even pre&s;ent at the di&s;pute, I an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mo&s;t certainly; and that I de&s;pi&s;ed the man who did not look at a fine woman; however, I begged leave to ob&s;erve, that there were two di&s;tinct ways of looking at her&mdash;with <HI>admiration,</HI> and with <HI>un|authorized contempt:</HI>&mdash;that the conduct I cen&s;ured, was &s;trongly of the latter kind; and on that I founded my opinion, that the offenders were <HI>four dirty impertinent puppies.</HI>"</Q> On this, he con&s;equen|tially remarked, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That even <HI>he him&s;elf</HI> had been &s;erv|ed thus, when <HI>he</HI> look'd at a fine woman."</Q> To which I an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That I had not the lea&s;t doubt, but that he merited any ob&s;ervation which might be made to him on that head."</Q> On this, he <HI>greatly</HI> an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he would knock the ra&s;cal down who dared to &s;ay &s;o;"</Q> and <HI>nobly</HI> put his hand to his &s;word.</P>
<P>This <HI>intere&s;ting</HI> conference was, for the moment, interrupted by Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> who ob&s;erved, that he &s;uppo&s;ed I was a Clergyman. Receiving an an&s;wer in the affirmative, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Perhaps then, you will
<PB N="14" REF="13">
take the advantage of your profe&s;&s;ion, and not give me the &s;atisfaction I &s;hall demand."</Q> To which I replied, That he never &s;hould find I availed my&s;elf of that, to act in any manner derogatory from the cha|racter of the Gentleman.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> now be|came abundantly plea&s;ant on this di&s;covery of my profe&s;&s;ion, which I parried as well as I was able; and, in return, began to hold up this <HI>creature of all creatures</HI> to public deri&s;ion. The dre&s;s, hat and feather,&mdash;miniature picture, pendant at his &s;now|white bo&s;om, and a variety of other delicate appen|dages to this <HI>man of fa&s;hion,</HI> were naturally &s;eized upon by me, and &s;et off to the be&s;t advantage.&mdash;Here, however, as the laugh grew warm again&s;t him, I was attacked by a <HI>bran-&s;pan</HI> new face, another red|hot Hibernian, who was &s;carcely intelligible. His ignorance of our language, I believe, pre&s;erved me from that in&s;olence, which his &s;avage countenance &s;trongly menaced. Him however I &s;oon cut &s;hort, by ob&s;erving, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the affair could by no means concern him, and that therefore, he was an <HI>im|pertinent fellow</HI> for his pains."</Q></P>
<P>The company who a&s;&s;embled round us, on this occa&s;ion, being de&s;irous of knowing the cau&s;e of the di&s;pute, I told it them in a few words, and then appealed, whether I had not done as much as could be expected of me, even if wrong in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, by giving my name and addre&s;s?&mdash;And whether Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI> or any indifferent per&s;on, had a right thus wantonly to interfere in a matter, in which he was by no means concerned?&mdash;So far &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of his conduct, he was generally hooted by the whole company, and jo&s;tled into the middle of the Gardens, where I left him to lament his folly; and immediately took coach, and returned with Mrs. <HI>Hartley,</HI> &amp;c. to town.</P>

<P>I WAS in hopes, that a moment's reflection would have convinced you of the general im|propriety of that conduct la&s;t night, I was un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of remarking.

<P>Immediately upon this, I repaired in &s;earch of, and &s;oon found Mr. <HI>Tateham,</HI> a gentleman who was pre&s;ent at the affray in the Gardens, and who readily accompanied me to dinner to the Turk's Head Coffee-hou&s;e, in the Strand. On our arrival here, I gave orders to the waiters, that if any gentlemen inquired for me, to &s;hew them to our room. In the cour&s;e of our dinner, Mr. <HI>Dawes,</HI> a young gentleman of the law, and a friend of mine, hearing of the nature of the di&s;pute, and of my being there, &s;ent in his name, and begged to attend me through it; to this I will|ingly con&s;ented, as Mr. <HI>Tateham</HI> was under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of going out of town that evening, and I knew not at a certainty when the matter might be finally decided.</P>
<P>Not long after this, Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> attended by his friend, (whom I afterwards found to be the Honour|able Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI>) arrived, who were immediately &s;hewn in. After &s;ome cu&s;tomary civilities on each &s;ide, Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> addre&s;&s;ed me, by ob&s;erving, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That he &s;uppo&s;ed I knew the nature of his vi&s;it.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;To which I an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>I certainly did, if that letter which I had then in my hand was written by him, and contained his &s;entiments.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;He rejoined in the affirmative to both;
<PB N="19" REF="18">
on which I remarked, that it was not po&s;&s;ible then we could go out upon the terms he might require, until he had put &s;ome of his threats in execution.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> on this warmly interfered; and ob|&s;erved, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>that this was not the time to recapitulate parti|culars; the matter being &s;imply reduced to one point, which, as Capt.</HI> Crofts<HI>'s friend, he was deputed to a&s;k me,</HI> viz. <HI>Whether I cho&s;e to a&s;k Capt.</HI> Crofts<HI>'s par|don in all the public papers, for &s;aying I would wring his no&s;e off his face, or go out with him in half an hour?</HI>"</Q>&mdash;To this peremptory demand, I directly replied:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That being &s;en&s;ible of no impropriety in this in&s;tance, I &s;hould not make any conce&s;&s;ion at all; nor did I think my&s;elf ju&s;tified, after the treatment I had received in Capt.</HI> Crofts<HI>'s letter, to go out with him, till he had executed one of his threats; after which I would certain|ly attend him.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> on this begged leave to reduce the &s;ub&s;tance of the que&s;tion and an&s;wer to writing; which was done by him and me, in words nearly as above.&mdash;After this he a&s;ked me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Whether I was not now wrong in urging Capt.</HI> Crofts <HI>to &s;trike me; as from his &s;ituation in a military capacity, nothing but the life of one of us could atone for it?</HI>"</Q>&mdash;To this I an|&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That having been in the army my&s;elf, I was not to be informed of the etiquette thereof in this particular; and was therefore apprized of the grounds on which I &s;tood.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>On this Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>that he mu&s;t beg then I would go over to France, le&s;t the con&s;equence might prove fatal to his friend.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;This new expedition however, I begged leave to wave, by informing him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That &s;en&s;ible of the propriety of my conduct, I would by no means leave England, be the event what it would."</Q>&mdash;Here Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> interpo&s;ed,
<PB N="20" REF="19">
and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The matter might be &s;ettled without &s;uch an excur&s;ion; for as a mi&s;repre&s;entation of my character had been the cau&s;e of his &s;ending me the above letter, and being now convinced that the rever&s;e of the report was the fact, he apologized for the error, and acquainted me, that he now looked upon me as a gentleman in every re&s;pect."</Q></P>
<P>Immediately upon this, I took him by the hand, confe&s;&s;ed his behaviour to be manly, and told him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That as we could now go out as gentlemen, I was ready to attend him, according to his reque&s;t:"</Q>&mdash;Then turning to Mr. <HI>Dawes,</HI> begged he would provide a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols, and any other nece&s;&s;aries that might be wanting. The Ring in Hyde Park being propo&s;ed as the ground, I objected to it, for fear of interruption; and therefore recommended to Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dawes,</HI> our &s;econds, to pro|vide a more private place; at the &s;ame time intimat|ing a de&s;ire, that we might have a gentleman of the faculty near us, in ca&s;e either of us &s;hould unfor|tunately &s;tand in need of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;Here Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> ob&s;erved, that the afternoon was rather an unu&s;ual time for the&s;e matters, and therefore urged it might &s;tand over till Sunday morning four o'clock.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the affair was di&s;|agreeable enough at pre&s;ent in every point of view to me, and therefore I would not on any account, &s;uffer it to hang another night upon my mind."</Q> This, with Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI>'s citing the ca&s;e of Lords <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> and <HI>Bellamont,</HI> to prove that it was not &s;o very unu&s;ual as was repre&s;ented, produced an unani|mous agreement, that we &s;hould therefore in&s;tantly take a po&s;t coach and four, with a &s;urgeon, drive down to Richmond-Park, and there finally deter|mine the whole difference.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
At the in&s;tant we were about to quit the room, Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> abruptly broke in upon us, with his hat on, and, in the mo&s;t in&s;olent tone of voice, demanded &s;atisfaction of me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in the name of <HI>his friend Capt. Miles,</HI> who was without in the Coffee|room, waiting with the utmo&s;t impatience."</Q> Hay|ing recovered from the &s;urprize, I an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he came rather <HI>mal a propos,</HI> as I was going out that moment to &s;ettle a point of honour with Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> which I hoped would rectify the whole matter."</Q>&mdash;To this he replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That his friend in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;atisfaction fir&s;t; and therefore I &s;hould not go out with any other man until he had received it; and that even after this, there were <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four others</HI> who in&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;ame."</Q>&mdash;I now appealed to Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> and Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> to know in what manner I &s;hould act; telling them, I could fight but one at a time, and therefore would be directed by them; my &s;econd frequently interrupting with &s;imilar ob&s;ervations:&mdash;I begged leave that Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> would introduce his friend Capt. <HI>Miles,</HI> that I might &s;ee this man, whom I was a&s;&s;ured I could not have offended.</P>
<P>He replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he could not do that, as Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> was &s;o enraged again&s;t me, that probably he might beat me."</Q> I ob&s;erved, That I fancied my&s;elf in the company of Gentlemen; and even at the wor&s;t I could defend my&s;elf, and therefore begged he might be introduced.&mdash;He now informed me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> only came <HI>to fight me my own way; and there|fore if I</HI> did not box him immediately, he would knock me down wherever he &s;aw me in public."</Q> Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> now in|terpo&s;ed, by ob&s;erving, That I had behaved in every re&s;pect like the gentleman; that from my pre&s;ent
<PB N="22" REF="21">
conduct, my character mu&s;t have been totally mi&s;re|pre&s;ented; and therefore begged this matter might drop, and Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> and I go out to &s;ettle our point:&mdash;This however Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> flatly refu&s;ed; but while I was in conver&s;ation with him, Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> con&s;ulted together, and agreed, that with my con&s;ent, the affair between Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> and me might be adju&s;ted, if &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions were made on either &s;ide; to which I immediately a&s;&s;ented, if it could po&s;&s;ibly be done con&s;i&s;tent with my honour. Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> there|fore fir&s;t declared, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI> having been ungenteelly treated, Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> acted with great &s;pirit and propriety in defending her."</Q> To which I readily replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That point being granted, I begged Mr. <HI>Crofts</HI>'s pardon for any unguarded ex|pre&s;&s;ion, which aro&s;e from a mi&s;under&s;tanding on both &s;ides."</Q></P>
<P>Thus far being amicably &s;ettled, we returned to the former &s;ubject; and on Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI>'s retiring, Captain <HI>Miles</HI> was introduced. Addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to him, I acquainted him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That I had never &s;een his face before, and therefore was ignorant how I could offend him."</Q> I therefore begg'd leave to a&s;k him, Whether he was the per&s;on who took Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI>'s part in Vauxhall-Gardens? To which he confu&s;edly an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes; and he now came to take the part of his friend Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall.</HI>"</Q> I told him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he would be di&s;appointed of the &s;atisfaction he intended him&s;elf, for that I never boxed with a gentleman, nor ever would; but if he had a violent inclination to box, and nothing would &s;atisfy him without it, I would &s;end for two chairmen, give them a guinea a-piece, and beat, or be beaten, by them."</Q>&mdash;Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="22">
now &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It did not &s;ignify talking any more about it, for that if I did not fight him now, Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> was determined to beat me at Vaux|hall, or any where he next &s;aw me."</Q> To which I an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;hould be there every night next week, and would certainly defend my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Here the congre&s;s broke up, Me&s;&s;. <HI>Lyttleton, Fitz-Gerall,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> going out. Not willing they &s;hould enjoy any thing like the &s;hadow of a triumph, I run in&s;tantly after them into the &s;treet, perhaps indeed, imprudently, and, overtaking them on the pavement, oppo&s;ite Catharine-&s;treet, I told the <HI>Captain,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That rather than receive any public in&s;ults, if he would fix an hour on Monday morning, and bring either of the gentlemen then with him, I would meet him, and give him the &s;atisfaction he re|quired."</Q> I received no other an&s;wer than <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Damn ye now, Sir.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;Not able to contain my&s;elf any longer, I beckoned him into the pa&s;&s;age of the Spread Eagle Tavern, where we went into the front dining-room, attended by our friends, as before. I again addre&s;&s;ed him, and begged he would not in&s;i&s;t upon this porter-like bu&s;ine&s;s, or that he would tell me how I had offended him; intimating to him, at the &s;ame time, that I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected I could beat him. Not being able to pacify him with words, we &s;tripped, and previous to the on&s;et, I addre&s;&s;ed Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to te&s;tify how di&s;agreeable it was to me; and if there could be a propriety in &s;uch an exerci&s;e, which I much doubted, begged it might be here ob&s;erved on both &s;ides."</Q> The&s;e proper preliminaries being &s;ettled, the <HI>Captain</HI> received in about fifteen minutes the <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> he required, not being able to di&s;cern a &s;ingle ray of light, by which to find his way home.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
Three Iri&s;h Chairmen, I have this in&s;tant learnt, were hired to attend the meeting (according to their own confe&s;&s;ion to Mr. Engli&s;h, Ho&s;ier, in Catharine-Street) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>to &s;ee their little Tommy,</HI> (Capt.

<P>This <HI>ungentlemanlike</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s being however &s;ettled, we all returned to the Turk's Head, except the un|fortunate Capt. <HI>Miles,</HI> when my conduct was in general highly commended, and Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> on his leaving us, begged I would oblige him with my company to dinner the next day, (Sunday.)</P>
<P>On their departure, Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> and I began to collect together &s;ome circum&s;tances, which led us to &s;u&s;pect, that this Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> was an hired brui&s;er.&mdash;His mo&s;t amazingly confu&s;ed addre&s;s, the manner in which his friends treated him, and his new awk|ward ve&s;tments, all con&s;pired to convince us he was a <HI>made-up gentleman</HI> for the bu&s;ine&s;s. Determined, however, to act with caution in the inve&s;tigation of the matter, the next day when I dined with Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> I a&s;ked him in the drawing-room apart, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whether he knew Capt. <HI>Miles?</HI>"</Q> To which he an&s;wered, with a &s;hrug of the &s;houlders, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He did not."</Q> Not a word more on the &s;ubject pa&s;&s;ed the whole day, though Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> and Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> were of the party.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To &mdash; FITZ-GERALL, E&s;q.</OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE honour of your vi&s;it to me this morning at one o'clock, was of &s;o &s;ingular a nature, that a pub|lic acknowledgement of it cannot be chargeable with any violent impropriety.&mdash;It will &s;ave us both an infinity of trouble. The curious will be informed of the circum&s;tances on both &s;ides, without the tedious formalities of &s;eparate narrations.&mdash;</P>
<P>In the late infamous affray, from whence I de|rived the melancholy con&s;equence of your ac|quaintance, it is I believe, generally under&s;tood, that I acquitted my&s;elf with a tolerable degree of prudence and fortitude. The voice of candour has therefore upon that event, pre&s;cribed a &s;olemn di|&s;tance
<PB N="28" REF="27">
between us for ever: you will, perhaps, think it too rigid; &s;ince it will now &s;carce permit me to look down upon, or lament the &s;ituation of a wretch, &s;ince that wretch is the wanton, &s;elf-created, out-ca&s;t of &s;ociety. Yet premeditated Villainy mu&s;t not go unpuni&s;hed: However dark and &s;ecret his foot&s;teps, I will indu&s;triou&s;ly trace the mon&s;ter, till public atonement be made, or he hide his &s;avage head eter|nally in oblivion.</P>
<P>I would fain attribute your dark attempt of la&s;t night, or rather this morning, to tho&s;e Bacchana|lian &s;allies, which have regularly preceded you to the chair of Infamy: But it &s;avours too much of deliberate villainy, to be le&s;s than the machination of &s;ome daemon of revenge.&mdash;I own my &s;ituation was &s;omewhat unplea&s;ant, when four armed gentlemen, attended by two others, came to my chambers in the dead of night, knocked up my &s;ervant, and endea|voured, under a feigned voice, and other &s;pecious pretences, to allure me from my bed: the in&s;tant I had entered among&s;t you in the dark, I doubt not but your triumph had been complete. The &s;ummons of a known poltroon I never obey, and therefore I e&s;caped; for, Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> I believe was the only one who had even a pretence for &s;peaking with me. I honour the impudence of that man, who, knowing he has too far degraded him&s;elf below the dignity of a gentleman ever to be &s;een in that light again, now talks of nothing but <HI>Bullets and Bag&s;hot.</HI> Before my knowledge of <HI>your friend</HI> Captain <HI>Miles,</HI> you could tamely &s;ubmit to be called an <HI>impertinent, meddling puppy</HI> in the mid&s;t of Vauxhall Gardens; a phra&s;e that would have called forth the re&s;entment of a grocer's apprentice; but when you and the world are informed of the mode of cha&s;ti&s;ement I have
<PB N="29" REF="28">
laid out for you, and which is the only one I can now conde&s;cend to be&s;tow upon you, we hear of nothing but <HI>Slugs in a Saw-pit.</HI></P>
<P>Think not, young gentleman, that the humours of la&s;t night, however oft repeated, will &s;hake me from my re&s;olve. I have zeal in &s;ome in&s;tances, which may &s;urmount the re&s;olution of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. Should you continue to watch each pale moon to her cham|bers of retirement through the circling year, and then &s;teal out when darkne&s;s reigns propitious to your de|&s;ign, &s;till, as long as I can e&s;cape the &s;tiletto, the ruffian &s;hall be dragged forth, however reluctant, to public view; where, as his de&s;igns were dark and hor|rid, his puni&s;hment &s;hall be proportionably ignomi|nious.</P>

<OPENER>To the Rev. Mr. HENRY BATE.</OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE unwarrantable freedom you have taken with my character in your narrative of the Vauxhall tran&s;|actions, and the little regard you have paid to truth and candour, con&s;train me to lay before the public a
<PB N="30" REF="29">
<HI>true</HI> and <HI>impartial</HI> account of that affair, &s;o far as I had any concerns in it directly or indirectly: Nor can I entertain the lea&s;t doubt, but that upon a fair hearing, my conduct from the beginning to the end will bear the common &s;terling &s;tamp of the gentleman, the man of honour, and, (if rightly con&s;idered by Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> him&s;elf) the <HI>real friend.</HI></P>
<P>To begin then my ju&s;tification; even you your|&s;elf, Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> will do me the ju&s;tice to acknowledge I was not pre&s;ent when the pretended rudene&s;s you &s;o much complain of was offered to Mrs. Hartley. In fact I was in another part of the gardens: But the rumour being in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;pread over the whole place, that Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> had been in&s;ulted with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abu&s;e and foule&s;t language by a gentleman then unknown; I own, Sir, I made what expedi|tion I could to find my friend, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to prevent any fatal con&s;equences. When I found Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> Sir, you was in conference with him, words had run very high between you both, and the cau&s;e of all this <HI>fracas,</HI> it &s;eems, was, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI> had been looked at in a manner (as you &s;ay) not altogether genteel."</Q> This being the ground of the quarrel, I thought there was room to qualify the &s;uppo&s;ed affront that had unintentionally been given to this lady, and I ob&s;erved, that certainly every man had a right to look at a <HI>fine woman.</HI> I flattered my&s;elf, that by giving Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI> that epithet, which &s;o ju&s;tly is her due, I &s;hould receive at lea&s;t a decent, if not a polite an&s;wer, more e&s;pecially as I declared to you, that I only came to <HI>mediate</HI> the af|fair. Sir, I am now appealing to the tribunal of the public, and upon my honour I &s;olemnly de|clare I had no other intentions when I acco&s;ted you, but to mediate the affair between Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> and
<PB N="31" REF="30">
you. The one I knew to be a gentleman, the other, by his dre&s;s, <HI>appeared</HI> to be &s;o; and I was in hopes of reconciling you both. But, Sir, what opinion mu&s;t the public have of your veracity in telling your own tale, when, in&s;tead of thanking, or at lea&s;t meeting me half way in my endeavours to <HI>mediate,</HI> you abruptly an|&s;wered in the&s;e very words, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Damn you for your mediation;</HI> you are an impertinent puppy for your pains."</Q> This an&s;wer of yours, Sir, you have not only je&s;uitically with-held from the public; but you are plea&s;ed to tell them another &s;tory, and add, <Q REND="inline">"that on this, I <HI>greatly</HI> an&s;wered, I would knock the ra&s;cal down who dared to &s;ay &s;o, and nobly put my hand to my &s;word."</Q> Sir, you know in your own con&s;cience I never men|tioned the word ra&s;cal, nor did I tell you that I would knock any man down who dared to &s;ay &s;o. Nature, Sir, has not ca&s;t me in an athletic mould, nor has the &s;cience of brui&s;ing had any &s;hare in my gymna&s;tic education. It is true, indeed, when you gave me the ungentlemanlike an&s;wer I have mentioned above, I ob&s;erved to you that you had no &s;word, but that you might ea&s;ily borrow one, and that we had better retire than make any noi&s;e in &s;o public a place. I declare, Sir, upon my honour, that at the time I gave you this whi&s;per in the ear, I was an utter &s;tran|ger to your profe&s;&s;ion; nor, from your preceding be|haviour, could I po&s;&s;ibly divine that you were in <HI>holy orders;</HI> much le&s;s could I dream of any &s;uch thing by the an&s;wer you gave me, which was, that you did not chu&s;e to encounter me <HI>that way,</HI> but that, if I had a mind to try my &s;kill at brui&s;ing, you was entirely at my &s;ervice. Thus, Sir, &s;tood the <HI>demel&eacute;</HI> I had with you, when Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> gave me to under&s;tand that you was a PARSON. Upon this ecclairci&s;&s;ement you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that <Q REND="inline">"I became abundantly plea|&s;ant
<PB N="32" REF="31">
and witty upon your eccle&s;ia&s;tical character."</Q> The real truth is, and I will not di&s;gui&s;e it, I replied, That I was a&s;hamed of your behaviour, and that you ought to have your gown publicly &s;tripped from off your &s;houlders; and from that moment I determined, Sir, even though your conduct towards me had been a thou&s;and times more reprehen&s;ible than it really was, and though you had &s;worn a thou&s;and more oaths than I am &s;orry to &s;ay you did, I determined within my own mind to pay every po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect to your cloth, and treat you as a man, who, if not out of his &s;en&s;es, was at lea&s;t within the &s;acred pale and protection of the church. For, Sir, I had a character at &s;take, which I might have endangered, had I applied either my &s;word or my cane, knowing you to be a clergy|man. But, Sir, notwith&s;tanding the lenity and pru|dence I manife&s;ted on this occa&s;ion, I cannot help repeating, that I think you de&s;erve to have your ca&s;|&s;ock pulled over your ears. I may, however, be erroneous in my judgment, as no per&s;on is a proper judge in his own cau&s;e; but if you think my judg|ment in the wrong, Sir, I am very willing to &s;ubmit the cen&s;ure I thus pa&s;s upon your public conduct to the deci&s;ion and final adjudication of your own Dio|ce&s;an, who, I under&s;tand, is the Bi&s;hop of London, and whom all the world mu&s;t allow to be a competent arbitrator.</P>

<OPENER>To GEO.-ROBERT FITZ-GERALL, E&s;q.</OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN villainy has wrought the human mind to a certain degree of deformity, the phaenomenon, at|tracting our admiration, may influence the weake&s;t of our pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Having confe&s;&s;ed the originality of your character, and even now a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch a wonder-work of Providence, con&s;idering the frailty of human nature, I wi&s;h our dealings hereafter to be as limited as po&s;&s;ible. I own that you have betrayed me into a weakne&s;s, by forcing me for a moment to di&s;|pute the rectitude of the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem. But, doubtle&s;s, the &s;ame exten&s;ive Wi&s;dom who gave being to the <HI>blood-enveloped hou&s;e-breaker,</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating foot|pad,</HI> found it nece&s;&s;ary, in his my&s;terious operations, to create a being, in whom &s;hould center the defor|mities of both. The man, impatient of violent in|juries, may here be rather innocently led to arraign the Divine Ju&s;tice; but I am thankful, that reflection has weight enough with me to bani&s;h &s;uch melancholy ideas; and rejoice from thence to find, that a &s;acred <HI>ne plus</HI> is a&s;&s;igned even to the mo&s;t refined degeneracy. If we could ever be led to doubt the po&s;ition, your letter of this day mu&s;t convince us&mdash;<HI>that the vicious ignorance of the darke&s;t profligate betrays it&s;elf in language; and that his vices are therefore &s;eldom or never contagious, but from a per&s;onal intercour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">
Being now in no danger of becoming a convert to the creed of libertini&s;m and treachery, from the im|potence of tho&s;e arguments dealt out for their &s;upport by niggard Nature, a di&s;tant corre&s;pondence of this kind I will never refu&s;e you. If &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ion can at all amu&s;e in this your di&s;graceful &s;tate of exile from &s;ociety, I have that Chri&s;tian charity which will not let me with-hold it from you.&mdash;Forlorn and wretched as you really are, I will give you a tempo|rary relief from the pangs of &s;elf-conviction, by en|ticing your feeble talents ever and anon into their di|minutive kind of exertion.</P>
<P>Dragged forth with horrible reluctance, ten days being elap&s;ed, you make a mi&s;erable entrance in this day's <HI>Gazetteer;</HI> and after the example of every &s;elf|convicted culprit, unwilling to plead <HI>guilty,</HI> you make a contemptible appeal to the public, in the nature of a defence. Generou&s;ly giving <HI>you</HI> credit for its ma|&s;terly formation, I apprehend the whole burden of it to be &s;trictly this:&mdash;<HI>That your interpo&s;ition was that of a mediator;&mdash;that I damn'd you for your mediation, and called you an impertinent puppy for your pains;&mdash;that you told me I had no &s;word on, but that I might borrow one;&mdash;and that I replied, I did not chu&s;e to engage you that way, but that if you had a mind to try your &s;kill at brui&s;ing, I was entirely at your &s;ervice.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Unfortunately for you, my gentle <HI>Paris!</HI> not a &s;hadow of truth re&s;ts on either of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, ex|cept that indeed of your being <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>an impertinent puppy for your pains,</HI>"</Q> which I acknowledged in my letter of ye&s;terday to have &s;aid to you; nor need you there|fore have taken &s;uch an infinity of pains to enforce, what is already &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on my mind, and on that of the public.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">
Re&s;cued from the danger as a naked man, I can|not now but laugh at your &s;avage notions of a media|tor;&mdash;but my wonder cea&s;es, when I recollect to have read of two gentlemen going out to fight, one of whom was &s;hot through the head by a mediatorial friend, in order to prevent the con&s;equence of a tri|umph on either &s;ide.&mdash;I fancy Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> cannot but recollect the mode of your fir&s;t addre&s;s, and there|fore I will not enforce the evidence of <HI>my friends,</HI> till that gentleman, or &s;ome other, will &s;tep forth in public, and bear <HI>you</HI> witne&s;s. As far as re&s;pects the &s;word bu&s;ine&s;s, it is entirely either the effect of a phren&s;ied and di&s;tempered brain, or the paltry, forged eva&s;ion of an equivocating reptile. To one and the &s;ame cau&s;e mu&s;t I a&s;&s;ign the origin of the <HI>brui&s;ing,</HI> &s;ince I repeatedly and &s;tudiou&s;ly told you all, THAT <HI>was never my plan.</HI> Nay, had it been,&mdash;what could tempt me to it, when Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> was the tiny object of my re&s;entment! I appeal to your friend Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> whether I did not repeatedly di&s;own &s;uch a mode to <HI>him?</HI> and if I waved it here, where &s;ome triumph might have been the con&s;equence, how could I conde&s;cend to think of &s;uch an operation, when your little pre&s;ence of aerial divinity courted my thoughts from manhood, to a &s;ilent contemplation of the progre&s;&s;ive beauties of the pigmy &s;y&s;tem?</P>
<P>No, my dear little whim&s;ey-formed being, let no &s;uch rude forebodings di&s;turb thy pretty peace in future! Terrific as my &s;trides appear to &s;uch &s;ilphs and &s;ilphids, I have long forgotten that &s;chool-boy plea&s;ure of <HI>breaking butterflies on the wheel;</HI> nor would I now cru&s;h a noxious reptile, had it not attempted to &s;ting the foot, that meant not to di&s;turb it.</P>
<P>I cannot take leave of you, without acknowledging your political merit, in referring the nature of our
<PB N="36" REF="35">
di&s;pute to the arbitration of the <HI>Bi&s;hop of London.</HI> I will not accu&s;e <HI>you</HI> with the thought, notwith&s;tanding its excellence.&mdash;Candid as it may appear, I mu&s;t however decline it, tho' no man e&s;teems this illu&s;tri|ous prelate more than I do. I know his worth, as a man; his excellence, as a chri&s;tian: yet his decree mu&s;t be in &s;ome re&s;pect, oppo&s;ite to the feelings of humanity. You know not perhaps, the motto of the reverend bench, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>If a man &s;mite thee on the right cheek, turn unto him thy left al&s;o.</HI>"</Q> This, I own is an ex|cellent &s;y&s;tem, accompanied with lawn &s;leeves: the&s;e pious appendages have a &s;oporific quality, depriving the wearers of any other than a theorical knowledge of it. However, point me not out to their Lord&s;hips as an heretic in this in&s;tance; for I have no objection to fall into their notions, upon &s;imilar terms.&mdash;</P>
<P>The fiery taper of youth will naturally burn le&s;s and le&s;s glaring, as Time with frigid hand &s;hall call forth his hoary emblems on our head. The mitre then adorns the reverend brow; the holy cro&s;ier guards its <HI>&s;ingle</HI> prie&s;t from violence.&mdash;In this calm &s;tand-&s;till of life, the hour may come, when I &s;hall wi&s;h for &s;uch &s;acred protections; and without an abundance of miracles, time might vouch&s;afe to work me to the &s;acred purpo&s;e.&mdash;Then, being free from the wanton attacks of libertini&s;m, my right-reverend feelings, would be reduced to a narrow and peaceable compa&s;s;&mdash;then could I perhaps, declaim in favour of that non-re&s;i&s;tance which my youthful impetuo&s;ity pointed out as no virtue, and even being &s;mitten by Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> on the right cheek, might, from a fortitude truly religious,&mdash;<HI>turn unto him my left al&s;o.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the Rev. Mr. HENRY BATE.</OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE letter I addre&s;&s;ed to you, Sir, in <HI>Monday</HI>'s Gazetteer, I flatter my&s;elf hath fully convinced the impartial Public, my conduct throughout this tran&s;|action hath been that of the gentleman, and the man of honour: <HI>of the gentleman,</HI> by my treating you as &s;uch, &s;o long as I took you to be a LAYMAN. <HI>Of the man of honour,</HI> by cea&s;ing to demand &s;atisfaction, the very moment I knew you to be in <HI>holy orders.</HI> It now remains that I convince the &s;ame impartial Public, that I al&s;o acted to you as a real friend; I &s;ay <HI>real friend,</HI> Sir, becau&s;e if I &s;ee a Clergyman of the Church of England &s;candalou&s;ly expo&s;ing him&s;elf in public, and can po&s;&s;ibly make him feel his folly &s;o as to prevent a return of a &s;imilar paroxy&s;m; I think, Sir, even in your own opinion, I mu&s;t be allowed to be doing that Clergyman an act of real friend&s;hip. If you grant me this po&s;ition, then my reply is, <Q REND="inline">"Na|than, thou art the man."</Q> For I appeal to the whole company who were that night at <HI>Vauxhall,</HI> whether they did not deem you, as a man, lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of public &s;hame, public character, and public decorum?</P>
<P>De&s;perate as your <HI>di&s;order</HI> was, I did not de&s;pair to cure it. The only doubt with me was the <HI>modus curandi.</HI></P>
<P>To have con&s;igned you over to <HI>Lord Mansfield</HI>'s tip&s;taff might po&s;&s;ibly have had a temporary effect,
<PB N="38" REF="37">
but it would not have gone to the root of the di&s;order, and a relap&s;e in &s;uch a calenture as yours, &s;eemed to me to be death unavoidable.</P>
<P>On the other hand, had I taken this matter up &s;e|riou&s;ly, had I attempted to convince you, that the fate of nations is not now-a-days, decided by bodily &s;trength or mu&s;cular adroitne&s;s, but by the fu&s;il, bay|onet, and cannon; and that con&s;equently, in a poli|tical point of view, the &s;cience of brui&s;ing, &s;o far as it relates to gentlemen who are born to command fleets and armies, can be of no &s;ervice, and therefore contemned by them as a thing of no value; nay, had I even acknowledged that I approved of this <HI>brui&s;ing &s;cience,</HI> when confined to the lower cla&s;s of people, becau&s;e I think the national habits of vulgar courage ought never to be checked; I &s;ay, Sir, had I attempt|ed to have rea&s;oned with you in this manner, I &s;hould only have added fuel to fire. The only method then I could make u&s;e of with any hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, was to hold up to you the mirror of ridicule, not doubting but that I &s;hould find with the poet Horace,<Q><L><HI>Ridiculum Aeri</HI></L><L><HI>Fortius ac Melius, magnas plerumque &s;ecat res.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>On this plan, Sir, I will not conceal from you, that my fir&s;t intention was to have borrowed one of <HI>Foote</HI>'s wooden heroes; &s;trip him &s;tark naked, put him in a true Broughtonian attitude, and have told you, that he in&s;i&s;ted upon your fighting him. It was ob|jected, that you mu&s;t certainly &s;ee through the game that was going to be played upon you. I was, indeed, of a different opinion; and I ob&s;erved, that if the Knight of La Manch, who, in every re&s;pect, that of <HI>frantic courage</HI> excepted, was an excellent &s;cholar,
<PB N="39" REF="38">
and an accompli&s;hed gentleman, could &s;eriou&s;ly en|counter a wind-mill, or a barber's ba&s;on, your di&s;|order being &s;imilar to his, you would ea&s;ily fall into a &s;imilar deception, <HI>&s;pecie recti.</HI>&mdash;However, Sir, to comply with my friends, I &s;uffered my opinion to be over-ruled; yet unwilling to leave you uncured, I dre&s;&s;ed one of my &s;ervants, introduced you to him, as a per&s;on you greatly affronted, and a pitched battle en&s;ued between you both, to the great diver&s;ion of the few bye-&s;tanders, who were privy to the &s;ecret, which hath been pompou&s;ly recorded by your own pen in the Morning Po&s;t. But there is one little circum&s;tance, which out of charity I now tell you, and that is, I gave my &s;ervant &s;trict orders not to beat you unmercifully, and when we thought he had given you a &s;ufficient do&s;e, we not only interpo&s;ed and parted you, but we highly commended your bravery, and made you believe that you had &s;ealed up both the peepers of the redoubtable Capt. <HI>Miles.</HI></P>
<P>The good intention I had in playing the ri&s;ible farce upon you, was, that when you &s;hould come to the denouement of the plot, you might &s;ee <HI>qua&s;i in &s;peculo</HI> into what an infinite number of ab&s;urdities, embar|ra&s;&s;ments, and vulgari&s;ms your <HI>uncla&s;&s;ical</HI> propen&s;ity for brui&s;ing mu&s;t, <HI>as a Clergyman,</HI> unavoidably betray you; for, a man, not ab&s;olutely bereft of rea&s;on, to &s;ee his error, is to be half cured of it; and I had flattered my&s;elf, indeed, that I had happily made this half-way progre&s;s, and was determined to be an au|toptical witne&s;s of the real fact. With this intent I went la&s;t <HI>Saturday</HI> to your chambers in <HI>Clifford's-Inn;</HI> Mr. <HI>Montague,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Storer</HI> were &s;o obliging as to accompany me. It was nearly eleven o'clock at night, when I plea&s;ed my&s;elf with thinking that cool rea&s;on would have re&s;umed her empire, and
<PB N="40" REF="39">
that I &s;hould have found you preparing your&s;elf for the next morning's function of your holy office, and that con&s;equently all rancour, animo&s;ity, and ill-will was buried for ever in oblivion. But, Sir, how greatly were my hopes cre&s;t-fallen, when after gently knocking at your door, I found it barricadoed again&s;t me, though I repeatedly told you my name, and the real purport of my vi&s;it. In return for this my care and attention, all the &s;atisfaction I could obtain was, to hear my&s;elf called, <Q REND="inline">"an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in,"</Q> with reiterated a&s;&s;urances from your own lips, that the fir&s;t time you &s;hould meet me, either in the Mall, Vauxhall, Ra|nelagh, or the Pantheon, you would break every bone in my &s;kin. Sir, it is an ea&s;y matter to talk of breaking bones; but if you are not <HI>incurably gone,</HI> I now caution you not to attempt putting your menaces into execution. For if I mu&s;t be &s;erious with you, Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> you ought to know that the gentleman who can re&s;pect the protection of your cloth to a cer|tain degree, will beyond that degree protect him&s;elf. And I mu&s;t further ob&s;erve to you, that if in the de|fence of my per&s;on, any <HI>fatal con&s;equence</HI> &s;hould happen either to you or my&s;elf, the blame will now lie at the door of your Dioce&s;an, and not at that of</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE thread of incon&s;i&s;tent villainy being this day re-united, I have now before me the whole contemp|tible defence of the mo&s;t daring, yet ridiculous, di&s;|turber of the public peace.&mdash;It has been ob&s;erved, that my former letters &s;oared too far above the nar|row limits of your puny under&s;tanding. I admit in part the propriety of the remark, and therefore, in this reply, I &s;hall &s;tudiou&s;ly confine my&s;elf to that &s;implicity of language which is found the abler advo|cate in the cau&s;e of virtue.</P>
<P>Pardon me, if here I breathe a digre&s;&s;ive &s;igh for &s;ome noble and worthy per&s;onages, who, till the fatal conclu&s;ion of your letter, had comforted them&s;elves with a flattering idea, that their kin&s;man was rather vicious from accident, than from principle, or fatal nece&s;&s;ity. The tears of penitence, young man, are a grateful and efficacious offering even to de&s;pairing friends, winning them, as it were, by enchantment, almo&s;t to our own terms of remi&s;&s;ion;&mdash;but, from your example, we are taught not to wonder, that a wanton and &s;tubborn per&s;everance alarms the dig|nity of their fortitude, and bids them renounce for ever the villain they could not reclaim.&mdash;</P>
<P>I have hitherto, Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI> in this corre&s;pond|ence with you, trifled with my own con&s;equence,
<PB N="42" REF="41">
rather pur&s;uing the delu&s;ive flights of imagination, than &s;tanding forth &s;imply your accu&s;er, as the injured man. However, a ju&s;t and public &s;acrifice can never be out of &s;ea&s;on, and therefore I will now pin you down to that public &s;take of infamy, from which the extravagance of your conduct will never let you ri&s;e. Behold me, therefore, literally a rigid accu&s;er, no longer wi&s;hing to trifle with the de&s;pondency of a cri|minal, or the patience of the public, his appointed judge.&mdash;If &s;hame will permit you to look up, you may now &s;ee how truly formidable is an injured indi|vidual rationally collected, and in&s;pired with a &s;trong but temperate fortitude, the powerful &s;taff ordained to &s;upport him.&mdash;The public, Sir, are impatient for the deci&s;ion, and therefore no <HI>hired</HI> eva&s;ions will longer avail you.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><HI>To the Rev. Mr.</HI> BATE.</OPENER>
<P>BY &s;eeing this letter in the paper, do not think I mean to continue a literary corre&s;pondence with you, Sir, who thrive by &s;candal, and live upon defamation; I therefore declare, that as this is the fir&s;t, &s;o it &s;hall be the la&s;t time I will publi&s;h any thing concerning the late affair at Vauxhall. I had indeed imagined that you and I, Sir, had finally &s;ettled all our differences: but as I find you have revived the &s;ubject, by your letters in the Morning Po&s;t, it is incumbent upon me to &s;et the mi&s;informed public right, in &s;ome particulars which you have gro&s;sly fal&s;ified.</P>
<P>You publicly call upon me to certify the truth of your having declined boxing, during the whole cour&s;e of your proceedings. Now, Sir, I as publicly declare, that &s;o far from declining, you long in&s;i&s;ted upon it, refu&s;ing me the &s;atisfaction I required, and calling upon me to put my threats into execution, which, you &s;aid, you would re&s;ent with your fi&s;t, and your fi&s;t only; and it was in con&s;equence of Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI>'s a&s;&s;uring you, that the i&s;&s;ue of the affair mu&s;t then of nece&s;&s;ity be fatal, that you conde&s;cended to <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"wave your privilege;"</Q> and, for the fir&s;t time in your life, put your&s;elf upon the footing of a gentleman.</P>
<P>Again, Sir, in your letter to Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI> you a&s;&s;ert that I &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI> having been ungen|teelly treated, Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> acted with great &s;pirit and propriety in defending her."</Q>&mdash;This, Sir, as I
<PB N="46" REF="45">
never thought, I never &s;aid: the concluding words that pa&s;&s;ed between us were as follows; I confe&s;&s;ed that you would have acted properly in protecting a lady who had in your company been publicly affronted, but that I did not think Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI> came under that predicament; and as to my&s;elf, I neither intended nor offered her an in&s;ult. In an&s;wer to which, you re|plied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am &s;orry my pa&s;&s;ion forced improper words from me, and I a&s;k your pardon."</Q> The&s;e, Sir, were your words; and as they were much attended to, they mu&s;t have been heard and remembered by every gen|tleman pre&s;ent. I little thought the affair would have terminated thus amicably, as I was far from imagining that there would have been any &s;top put to my determined re&s;olution of cha&s;ti&s;ing your in|&s;olence.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I take my leave of you, adverti&s;ing you that I have heard of your <HI>terrific</HI> threats, and denun|ciations of revenge. The&s;e I look upon as the ravings of a lunatic, and the frantic workings of a di&s;tempered brain. If, however, you have coolly concerted &s;chemes of meditated vengeance, I &s;hall not, Sir, appeal to the mediation of your dioce&s;an, or the interpo&s;ition of Ju&s;tice Fielding. I, Sir, am a &s;oldier, and look equally with an eye of contempt at the mi&s;chief of a monkey, and the malice of a monk.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS a man truly &s;en&s;ible of your &s;ituation, I cannot but pity your misfortunes.&mdash;You mu&s;t at la&s;t I think di&s;cover, the fatality of your league with an abandoned and de&s;picable a&s;&s;ociate, who will not let you now en|joy that retreat from an extravagant imprudence, which your penitentials, and my &s;ympathy, had hap|pily wrought for you. Convicted him&s;elf,&mdash;after the mo&s;t candid and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate hearing, he &s;eems dive&s;ted of that &s;avage kind of clemency which has dignified the robber and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; who bear individually the ven|geance of &s;ociety, rather than involve the partner of their guilt in the horrors of their puni&s;hment. This was the <HI>etiquette</HI> of heroic villainy; but now lo&s;t in the da&s;tard refinements introduced by our modern <HI>fine gentlemen:</HI> for Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> has hauled you forth, ere the con&s;cious blu&s;h of guilt had lo&s;t its empire o'er your cheek, in&s;i&s;ting that you &s;hall make a &s;imilar atonement with him, and that on the &s;ame public, and di&s;graceful &s;caffold.</P>
<P>With what a becoming diffidence do you face the world, Mr. <HI>Croftes,</HI> in this day's <HI>Gazetteer!</HI>&mdash;Your anticipations are &s;o melancholy and well founded, that I could, as far as re&s;pects my&s;elf, let them die away contemptibly with the jargon and non&s;en&s;e of the day.&mdash;We lament the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the wretched, culprit mariner, who declares with aching heart, that if he weathers but the perils of his pre&s;ent voyage, he ne'er
<PB N="48" REF="47">
will tempt the watery main again.&mdash;Yet Society has its &s;acred claims on culprits of every denomination; on that account, though you &s;tudiou&s;ly wi&s;h to pre|clude my reply, I cannot let you fall a &s;low and mi|&s;erable &s;acrifice to your own wretched feelings and fal&s;ehoods, when one friendly cru&s;h may annihilate you for ever.</P>
<P>After a lethargy of three tedious &s;ummer weeks, you are rou&s;ed from your &s;omnolency, and <HI>now</HI> attempt to invalidate a &s;imple narration of facts, which your &s;ilence, and the public candour, have &s;olemnly con|firmed. However apparently in&s;ignificant its orbit, that little fiery meteor <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> has its influence I perceive on certain <HI>pliant</HI> bodies; forcing the timid into that di&s;graceful &s;ervice in which he him&s;elf has been &s;o &s;hamefully defeated. The &s;ervile awe with which the whole <HI>petit maitre</HI> tribe look up to this gilded phantom of prowe&s;s, is a ju&s;tification of your prudence. I jump with you in opinion, that an ex|perimentary in&s;ult on a peaceable clergyman, who fights not but from nece&s;&s;ity, is le&s;s hazardous, than even a difference in opinion with another, who&s;e va|lour is founded on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was one, among&s;t others, of Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI>'s ob&s;ervations to me (perhaps <HI>in terr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters"></HI>) at the Turk's Head. It &s;eems not to tally, however, with an anecdote now circulating at <HI>Stuart</HI>'s, in Bond-&s;treet; where a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols are &s;aid to be &s;till hanging as di&s;graceful <HI>mementos</HI> of Mr. <HI>F&mdash;'s</HI> forgetfulne&s;s.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>his having fought eleven duels,</HI>"</Q> and who&s;e principal beauty ari&s;es from having lo&s;t the roof of his &s;kull by a pi&s;tol &s;hot.&mdash;</P>
<P>The world, Sir, are already convinced of your folly, and my circum&s;pection.&mdash;I will not therefore now di&s;pute with you my&s;elf on the two facts, the &s;ubject of your letters, which you have &s;o totally mi&s;repre|&s;ented. The candid will be &s;atisfied without it; and even the incredulous &s;hall be ea&s;ed of any doubts and
<PB N="49" REF="48">
&s;cruples about it, by the public te&s;timony of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who were pre&s;ent at the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I cannot however but remind you of this aukward introduction of your&s;elf to the public.&mdash;You ac|knowledge to &s;tand forth on my appeal.&mdash;Now, Sir, if my memory &s;erves me, the appeal was to prove, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I ob&s;erved to you repeatedly at <HI>Vauxhall,</HI> that boxing was by no means my plan, and therefore, if I refu&s;ed to <HI>you,</HI> where &s;ome honour might &s;uc|ceed a brui&s;ing conque&s;t, how could I (in <HI>Vauxhall</HI> ob&s;erve) think of &s;uch a mode with the tiny <HI>Fitz-Gerall?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Your ma&s;terly reply (admitting it true for the mo|ment) is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That I in&s;i&s;ted upon your putting the threats of your letter in execution, &amp;c. &amp;c. <HI>the next day at the Turk's Head Coffee-hou&s;e.</HI>"</Q> This is a mode of advancing &s;o truly <HI>Hibernian,</HI> that nothing but Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> having a mechanical command of you, could po&s;&s;ibly have occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>I believe I have worked my&s;elf up into that phi|lo&s;ophical contempt for complicated vice and folly, to be able to <HI>hear</HI> any thing you can advance, how|ever fal&s;e and atrocious, without the lea&s;t emotion. Since your own <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> di&s;po&s;ition, and the well-con|certed interpo&s;ition of an <HI>Iri&s;h renegado,</HI> and his at|tendant ruffians, prevented the proof po&s;itive of my courage, I will not &s;igh for a fre&s;h opportunity of di&s;playing it, but rather be thankful, that <HI>my</HI> honour has been pre&s;erved, without the lo&s;s of blood on either &s;ide.&mdash;You may now indulge your&s;elf, young man, with paroxy&s;ms of rage and vengeance; &s;ince neither <HI>my</HI> nece&s;&s;ities, nor vices, are &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, as &s;eriou&s;ly to demand my forfeit life,&mdash;&s;ince I never mean to be|friend that mo&s;t abject of all beings, who has not &s;pirit enough to di&s;engage <HI>him&s;elf</HI> from his mi&s;eries, but
<PB N="50" REF="49">
cowardly courts another's hand to drive him from ex|i&s;tence.</P>
<P>As a proof that I never vowed the lea&s;t vengeance again&s;t <HI>you</HI> whatever, I will even con&s;ent that all your anxieties &s;hall cea&s;e in future.&mdash;You &s;hall be a man of <HI>gallantry,</HI>&mdash;but it mu&s;t only be in tho&s;e politer re|gions, <HI>where beaux plume them&s;elves on di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the fair &s;ex!</HI>&mdash;You &s;hall be a <HI>man of honour</HI>&mdash;in that country where they a&s;k a public, and an ignominious acknowledgment of a &s;uppo&s;ed offender, or his blood in half an hour, and yet after that&mdash;<HI>blu&s;h not to make the fir&s;t conce&s;&s;ion.</HI>&mdash;You &s;hall be a man of <HI>cool,</HI> tho' <HI>re&s;olute courage,</HI>&mdash;where danger is happily precluded by <HI>the known interpo&s;ition of &s;ome generous friends.</HI>&mdash;You &s;hall be a man of <HI>&s;trict veracity,</HI>&mdash;where, after having been mean in one in&s;tance, they get over it, by <HI>hone&s;tly denying the fact</HI> in another.</P>
<P>Nay! come back from <HI>Richmond;</HI>&mdash;for, however offen&s;ive to Colonel <HI>Burgoyne,</HI> you &s;hall even be a SOLDIER &s;till!&mdash;But it mu&s;t be in that arduous &s;ervice, where FORTS and ARMIES own your friend <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI>'s hereditary government; where they fight with &s;cented quil pop-guns, loaded with <HI>bleu mange;</HI>&mdash;who&s;e armour is compo&s;ed of miniature pictures, and chicken gloves;&mdash;who e&s;cape the &s;everities of a noxious climate, by an artificial atmo&s;phere of ambro&s;ial e&s;&s;ences.</P>

<P>THE public has been lately much obliged to the literary talents of a Reverend Gentleman, for inve&s;ti|gating a difference between him&s;elf and an other, founded on a political cau&s;e; they are now enter|tained with one &s;omething &s;imilar, and equally as important to the world, but formed on a voluptuous one; for what, Sir, can we &s;tyle a party at <HI>Vauxhall,</HI> an intimate acquaintance with a Lady in a public character, and a di&s;play of knight-errantry in her de|fence, but an offering to the &s;hrine of Plea&s;ure? Our young Clergy, convinced of the ill effects of theolo|gical di&s;putes, are contriving &s;ome means to &s;often the au&s;terity of religion; &s;en&s;ible how di&s;gu&s;tful &s;ub|jects of that nature are become to this polite age; they have changed the tedious di&s;qui&s;itions of the fathers, to the more gentle topicks of gallantry and honour. 'Tis true their intention is humane and cha|ritable, worthy the applau&s;e of the pre&s;ent rewarders of merit; but methinks (to plea&s;e the generality of mankind) the tran&s;ition is rather too rapid. Though Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> did not contemplate, like <HI>Harvey,</HI> the calm delights of a garden, he might have &s;hunned the tu|multuous rever&s;e; he might have enjoyed the &s;ocial conver&s;e of a friend, without making him&s;elf the partizan of a quarrel; he could have noticed an in|&s;ult to a Lady, without particularizing him&s;elf in an affair which her hu&s;band thought unintere&s;ting.

<PB N="64" REF="63">
have prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Public to know who is the mo&s;t cen&s;urable; I cannot help (as I happened to be a &s;pectator) giving an impartial and candid account &s;o far as I &s;aw and heard, which was as follows, viz.</P>
<P>As Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Hartley,</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> with another gentleman or two were innocently enjoying them&s;elves over a few Vauxhall <HI>&s;lices,</HI> while their auricular faculties were ravi&s;h'd with the melodious &s;trains from the orche&s;tra, &s;uddenly a violent <HI>&s;quall</HI> of &s;ome de&s;cendants of Adam (who&s;e occupations might be in the manufactory of <HI>wigs,</HI> for what I can tell, as I never &s;aw any of them before) over&s;et their tranquillity, and entirely &s;unk for that night their plea&s;ures to the bottom. The Mariners, however, exerted all their efforts to weather the &s;torm, which I'm afraid they would not have accompli&s;h'd, had not Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> plied his <HI>oar</HI> in &s;o judicious a manner as fairly kept them above water, though he rowed into the very no&s;e of the <HI>&s;quall.</HI> But to be conci&s;e,&mdash;tho&s;e gentlemen, the incon&s;i&s;tencies of who&s;e behavi|our the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> &s;o &s;en&s;ibly delineated, in my opinion were highly reprehen&s;ible; if &s;ome open re|marks and long impertinent &s;tarings to di&s;cover the exact &s;ymmetry of every feature in Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI>'s face in that &s;ituation, are to be deem'd &s;o. One of the Macaroni <HI>Antilogui&s;ts,</HI> not quite &s;ix feet ten inches high, but uncommonly full of garrulity, with a look that would have intimidated a butterfly, thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed Mr. <HI>Bate;</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Par&s;on Bate! Par&s;on Bate, as you are a &s;oul-driver, it would much redound to my di&s;honour to box you, and as I believe you wou'd thra&s;h me were you to try, I will not attempt it; but you may be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall procure one, who will wallop you to your heart's content, the fir&s;t time he meets you.</HI>"</Q> By this reque&s;t Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> gave them directions where he was to be
<PB N="65" REF="64">
found, and as to the re&s;ult, he has candidly laid it open to the public in this paper before; it would therefore be nece&s;&s;ary to quote it again.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I hope every impartial per&s;on will acquie&s;ce with me, that the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> acted the part of a <HI>man,</HI> by heroically fru&s;trating the de|&s;igns of tho&s;e that certainly attempted to break a very material part of the Tenth Commandment.</P>

<P>THE conclu&s;ion of <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI>'s reply having made its appearance in this day's Gazetteer, I will venture to &s;ay that it is the weake&s;t defence I ever &s;aw; and had a premium been offered for the mo&s;t fooli&s;h production of the daily papers, the Gazetteer would have carried off the prize <HI>nem. con.</HI> To prove this, what can be more weak and ridiculous than his tale about Mr. <HI>Foote</HI>'s poppets, or more infamous than that a man (pardon the <HI>mi&s;nomer</HI>) who bears a com|mi&s;&s;ion under the king, &s;hould even bribe his foot|man to do that which he was afraid to do him&s;elf; that is, fight Mr. <HI>Bate.</HI> This was not only an affront to that gentleman, by putting his footman on a level with him, but to the army in general, in equipping a man with military ve&s;tments, cockade, &amp;c. that was a di&s;grace to it, and could be equalled in infamy only by his ma&s;ter. But to return to Mr. <HI>Foote</HI>'s poppets:&mdash;Though it is well known that Mr. <HI>Foote</HI> does not love fighting him&s;elf, I am of opinion he admires that &s;pirit &s;o much in others, he would not even keep a poppet in his pay, that would turn his back on Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall;</HI> whom, for his pu&s;illanimous behaviour in this affair, I &s;hall characteri&s;e as a kind of <HI>mandrake</HI> tottering under the mighty load of a cockade, like the poppy percharged with the morning dew. I &s;hall only &s;ay, Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> in both his letters &s;eems very de&s;irous of having the <HI>Bi&s;hop of London</HI> for his &s;econd, as well knowing that the &s;word, pi&s;tol, and hammer of death, form no part of his Lord&s;hip's <HI>camp equipage;</HI> and, &s;hould Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> make his ap|pearance, that he could &s;quat entrenched behind his

<P>IN the preamble to your defence, you intimate, that the impartial public will find, that your conduct to Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> in the late <HI>fracas,</HI> has been not only that of a <HI>Gentleman</HI> and <HI>Man of Honour,</HI> but of a <HI>Real Friend.</HI> Now, Sir, as I cannot trace the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of any one of tho&s;e characters through your whole narrative, I'm apt to conceive &s;ome errata have been committed to the pre&s;s.</P>

<P>The Paragraph beneath is taken from the LONDON PACKET of the &s;ame evening.</P>
<Q>A CORRESPONDENT &s;ays, that Capt.

When an officer talks or writes to a clergyman, or, in|deed any man of a civil profe&s;&s;ion, he &s;hould &s;urely aim at a placid, inoffen&s;ive &s;tyle, and forget the haughty language of a young en&s;ign to a corporal in a garri&s;on. To tell a clergyman, that his agreeing to fight a man with a cockade in his hat, was the fir&s;t in&s;tance of his gentleman-like behaviour, is a very gro&s;s in&s;ult to the dignity of the cloth in general; the clerical gown is

You, Mr. Fitz-Gerall, I principally addre&s;s, as having acted incon&s;i&s;tent both with the character of a &s;oldier and a man of honour. Your behaviour, Sir, was more like that of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in than of a gentleman, to come to a per&s;on's chambers at the dead of night, armed, and along with a &s;et of ruffians, who, no doubt, if you could have drawn

<P>YOU, and your reverend adver&s;ary have appealed to the Public, as if they were intere&s;ted in your di&s;|putes, or as if a quarrel between two ob&s;cure indivi|duals (of little con&s;equence to &s;ociety, and not very re&s;pectable) was an event of importance to the whole human race.</P>
<P>Such vanity I can ea&s;ily pardon, but when it is accompanied with an impudent and avowed in&s;ult, with a violation of that decency and re&s;pect which are due to the military, I hold it de&s;erving of the &s;e|vere&s;t cen&s;ure; and &s;ince you have &s;ubmitted your conduct to the tribunal of the Public, I &s;hall examine it with great freedom, but not I a&s;&s;ure you without candour.</P>
<P>As to the Prie&s;t, I &s;hall leave him to contemplate the di&s;graceful con&s;equences of an impertinent and officious interpo&s;ition. The hu&s;band of the woman (who by the bye appears to have been too &s;queami&s;h, con&s;idering her &s;tation in life) <HI>only</HI> was obligated to take cognizance of your rudene&s;s, and in <HI>his</HI> ab|&s;ence, her two friends who accompanied her to Vaux|hall, were the propere&s;t per&s;ons to cha&s;ti&s;e your in|&s;olence; but Prie&s;ts, in all ages, and of every com|munity, have been di&s;tingui&s;hed and de&s;pi&s;ed for their officiou&s;ne&s;s, and the conduct of this Reverend Gen|tlemen affords me a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why I &s;hould leave him to his reflections.</P>
<P>Your giving the rank of <HI>Captain</HI> to your livery &s;ervant, is the occa&s;ion of this letter; and though
<PB N="76" REF="75">
you may po&s;&s;ibly find an excu&s;e for every other part of your behaviour, I am fully per&s;uaded, Sir, you will not be able to ju&s;tify the liberty which you have taken with the Gentlemen of the army upon this oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>The military will not thank you for reducing them to a level with your dome&s;tic, and after declar|ing that your re&s;pect for the Church prevented <HI>your</HI> puni&s;hing your adver&s;ary, it is &s;omewhat extra|ordinary that the only in&s;tance you give of your re|&s;pect for religion, was the greate&s;t indignity you could po&s;&s;ibly offer to it! This circum&s;tance I pro|te&s;t is rather unlucky. It is a certificate of your country, but neither a proof of your courage nor humanity.</P>
<P>How unfortunate it is, that in almo&s;t every tran&s;|action you prove your&s;elf a native of Hibernia! Let us now, Sir, proceed to particulars.&mdash;You became engaged in a riot at Vauxhall, but not principally. The parties who were immediately concerned agreed to meet, and that meeting was at a Coffee-hou&s;e. While they, attended by their &s;econds, were &s;ettling the di&s;pute, your &s;ervant, with an a&s;&s;umed name and rank, demanded &s;atisfaction for a pretended in&s;ult, and upon this occa&s;ion you acted in your favourite character of a <HI>Mediator,</HI> by a&s;&s;uring the Par&s;on, that Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> was &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate, that if he was admit|ted, he might beat him with uncommon fury. I will pa&s;s over the indignity offered to the army, and leave the Military to correct your in&s;olence: they are very capable of doing it, and I have no doubt but they will take notice of the favour you have done them. I come now, Sir, to con&s;ider you in the character of a Gentleman: When you officiou&s;ly entered the room at the Coffee-hou&s;e, to inform Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> that
<PB N="77" REF="76">
Capt. <HI>Miles,</HI> whom he had in&s;ulted, was below, did it not occur to you, that you was guilty of a pre|meditated fal&s;ehood, at all times unworthy of a Gen|tleman, and particularly in this in&s;tance? And was it from that confu&s;ion of ideas &s;o common to your countrymen, that you blended the character of an <HI>Officer</HI> with that of a <HI>Bravo?</HI></P>
<P>Shame upon &s;uch ba&s;ene&s;s! By your letter of to|day, you &s;peak of Gentlemen that are BORN <HI>to command fleets and armies</HI>&mdash;BORN <HI>to command fleets and armies!</HI> Good Heavens!</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, Sir, you imagine the ranks of Admiral and General are hereditary, and that the &s;on of either mu&s;t &s;ucceed to the honours of the father, though it is very po&s;&s;ible this &s;on might be an arrant Coward, and a con&s;ummate Blockhead! The fate of a Nation &s;o unfortunately circum&s;tanced would be as precari|ous, as if you was at the head of a Fleet or Army.&mdash;A misfortune which I tru&s;t to God will never happen to us! I have one more remark to make, viz. the impropriety of a drunken man going at one o'clock in the morning to rea&s;on with his antagoni&s;t, attend|ed by three more. The late hour, and your different &s;ituations amount, Sir, to a pre&s;umption, that with this auxiliary aid you meant to accompli&s;h what your &s;ervant was on trial found incapable of. To me, your intentions appear to have been ho&s;tile; and the difficulty, not to &s;ay impo&s;&s;ibility of proving your&s;elf a Gentleman, and a man of honour, is manife&s;t in the confu&s;ion and perplexity which appear through|out the whole of a laborious defence, neither plau|&s;ible nor free from grammatical errors. As to Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> was I not a&s;&s;ured he had been in the army, I &s;hould have concluded by his letter to Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> that he was the Editor of the Gazette, or that a
<PB N="78" REF="77">
Statute of Bankruptcy had lately been i&s;&s;ued again&s;t him; and if he was in the &s;ecret, as you a&s;&s;ert he was, of giving the title of Captain to a Bravo, I &s;hall yet doubt the reality of his Military character.</P>
<P>As to Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> out of re&s;pect to his venerable and virtuous father, I &s;hall remain &s;ilent; I will not add to the anxiety of an aged and unhappy father, already depre&s;&s;ed with grief and &s;orrow for the Vices of a di&s;&s;ipated Son.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM one of that impartial Public who &s;o heartily concur in applauding Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> for the great &s;pirit and propriety with which he has conducted him&s;elf towards tho&s;e in&s;olent Macaronics, who dared to offend him, in the face of the world, in a manner &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to every &s;entiment of honour and hone&s;ty. It is not my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to canva&s;s this matter; the inve&s;tigation it has already gone through, &s;uffi|ciently evinces Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> to be really the gentleman, and the man of honour; and that his greate&s;t mis|fortune has been, having to do with per&s;ons &s;o totally devoid of every quality requi&s;ite to the con&s;tituting either of tho&s;e characters.&mdash;Nothing remains to be &s;aid on this &s;ubject that can increa&s;e Mr. <HI>Bate's</HI> merit, or the infamy and di&s;grace of his opponents. I defy either his, or any other pen, to add to that univer&s;al odium which they have &s;o effectually procured to them&s;elves; and therefore I hope, and doubt not, Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> will treat the letter addre&s;&s;ed to him in a paper of this day by Mr. <HI>Croftes,</HI> with that &s;ilent con|tempt &s;o ju&s;tly due to it.</P>
<Q><L>" For where no honour's to be gain'd,</L>

<P>And as to puni&s;hing the&s;e myrmidons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A name &s;ufficiently applicable, con&s;idering the <HI>very &s;ea&s;onable vi&s;it</HI> paid Mr. <HI>B&mdash;</HI> by them.</NOTE> with words, it is not po&s;&s;ible; we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity conclude them

long &s;ince lo&s;t to every feeling of humanity, or they never could, with that unparalleled effrontery, have made a public avowal of the &s;candalous and unwar|rantable impo&s;ture put upon Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> at the Turk's-head Coffee-hou&s;e; for which however it &s;eems he has an argument in &s;tore that will convince the facetious gentleman who makes his boa&s;t of it, of his error; <Q REND="inline">"for boys and brutes are only taught by blows;"</Q> and I make no doubt but this <HI>doughty</HI> gentleman's back will be found, upon the application of a cane, to enjoy a more delicate &s;en&s;ation than his heart.</P>

<P>The Paragraphs following came forth in the MORN|ING CHRONICLE of <HI>Wedne&s;day, Augu&s;t</HI> 11.</P>
<Q><P>IT is &s;trongly reported, that a friend&s;hip, which will probably be of duration, has commenced between a certain foppi&s;h Knight, now inve&s;ted with an office of &s;ome con&s;equence to the city of London and county of Middle&s;ex, and the fribbling, par&s;on-fearing Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI> founded on a fellow-feeling for each other. The Knight is beyond conception rejoiced that there is in the creation as abject a coward as him&s;elf; has therefore communicated to Mr. <HI>F.</HI> his readine&s;s to ac|company the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> to Tyburn in his public character, if the &s;aid <HI>B.</HI> &s;hould be convicted of maim|ing and defacing, with an intention to kill, before his &s;hrievalty expires.</P><P><PB N="82" REF="81">
Now we &s;ee the <HI>denouement</HI> of the petit piece of Vauxhall, (which had like to have turned out a deep Tragedy, if not to the great actre&s;s, to the reverend, &s;en&s;ible, and &s;pirited actor under her, and to &s;ome of the &s;pectators) we &s;urely cannot be at a lo&s;s to de|termine that the Par&s;on behaved well, as a <HI>brui&s;er</HI> and defender of the fair, but ill as a <HI>par&s;on</HI> and lecturer of others; as par&s;ons, like coblers, &s;hould not go beyond their <HI>la&s;t</HI> or text;</P>

<L>For, if Cobler-like, the Par&s;on will fight or get drunk,</L>
<L>Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow,</L>
<L>The re&s;t is all nothing, but leather and Prunella.</L>

<P>It is therefore hoped this will be a le&s;&s;on to all par&s;ons to &s;tick to their texts, and not ramble again to public places, not even with gods or godde&s;&s;es either of the &s;tage, pit, or gallery.</P></Q>

<P>Would they not have in&s;i&s;ted on his being tried by a Court-Martial for ungentleman-like behaviour?</P>
<P>Would not all of you (if you knew the man, and had been informed of his having acted as above) have &s;hunned and de&s;pi&s;ed him, and thought it a di&s;grace to be &s;een in his company?</P>
