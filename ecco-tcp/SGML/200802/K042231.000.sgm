<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>

<L>BOLD is the man, and compos mentis, &s;carce&mdash;</L>
<L>Who, in the&s;e nicer times, dares write a Farce;</L>
<L>A vulgar long&mdash;forgotten ta&s;te renew;</L>
<L>All now are Comedies, five acts, or two.</L>
<L>Authors have ever in a canting &s;train,</L>
<L>Begg'd mercy for the bantling of their brain:</L>
<L>That you, kind nur&s;e, wou'd fondle 't on your lap,</L>
<L>And rear it with applau&s;e, that be&s;t of pap&mdash;</L>
<L>Thus babes have in their cradles &s;cap'd a blow,</L>
<L>Tho' lame and ricketty from top to toe:</L>
<L>Our bard, with prologue-outworks has not fenc'd him,</L>
<L>For all that I &s;hall &s;ay, will make again&s;t him.</L>
<L>Imprimis, this his piece&mdash;a Farce we call it&mdash;</L>
<L>Ergo, 'tis low&mdash;and ten to one you maul it!</L>
<L>Wou'd you, becau&s;e 'tis low, no quarter give?</L>
<L>Black-guards, as well as Gentlemen, &s;hou'd live.</L>
<L>'Tis downright Engli&s;h too&mdash;Nothing from France;</L>
<L>Except &s;ome bea&s;ts, which treat you with a dance.</L>
<L>With a Burletta too we &s;hall pre&s;ent you&mdash;</L>
<L>And, not Italian&mdash;that will di&s;content you.</L>
<L>Nay, what is wor&s;e&mdash;you'll &s;ee it, and mu&s;t know it&mdash;</L>
<L>I <HI>Thomas King,</HI> of <HI>King-&s;treet,</HI> am the poet:</L>
<L>The murder's out&mdash;the murderer detected;</L>
<L>May in one night, be try'd, condemn'd, di&s;&s;ected.</L>
<L>'Tis &s;aid, for Scandal's tongue will never cea&s;e;</L>
<L>That mi&s;chief's meant again&s;t our little piece:</L>
<L>Let me look round, I'll tell you how the ca&s;e is&mdash;</L>
<L>There's not one frown a &s;ingle brow di&s;graces;</L>
<L>I never &s;aw a &s;weeter &s;et of faces!</L>
<L>Suppo&s;e <HI>Old Nick,</HI> before you righteous folk,</L>
<L>Produce a farce, brimfull of mirth and joke;</L>
<L>Tho' he, at other times, wou'd fire your blood;</L>
<L>You'd clap his piece, and &s;wear, 'twas <HI>devili&s;h</HI> good!</L>
<L>Malice prepen&s;e! 'tis fal&s;e!&mdash;it cannot be&mdash;</L>
<L>Light is my heart, from apprehen&s;ions free&mdash;</L>
<L>If you wou'd &s;ave <HI>Old Nick,</HI> you'll never damn poor me.</L>

<P>MY dear Jack&mdash;ten thou&s;and thanks for your punctuality&mdash;ready equip'd, I &s;ee, to &s;erve your friend.</P>

<P>But how can I &s;erve you, my young Don Quix|ote? Am I to be your Sancho while your Knight Errant&s;hip is running away with this Dulcinea del Tobo&s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have given orders that my po&s;t-chai&s;e &s;hall wait in the broad way by Exeter-Change, and the moment the lady &s;teps from her chair to the chai&s;e,
<PB N="2" REF="5">
the po&s;tilions will crack their whips, and drive away like lightning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a romantic fellow!&mdash;How can you po&s;|&s;ibly imagine, that your hot-headed &s;cheme to run away with this young lady can ever be executed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the ju&s;tice of my cau&s;e, Jack.</P>

<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ju&s;tice!&mdash;Make that out, and my con&s;cience will be ea&s;y.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not her father's uncle, who was a good lawyer and cheated my father of three-fourths of his fortune, leave her near thirty thou&s;and pounds?&mdash;Now, this is my rea&s;oning&mdash;Sir Toby's uncle ran away with &s;ome thou&s;ands from my father, I &s;hall run away with Sir Toby's daughter, this will bring the &s;aid thou&s;ands back to me again, with which I'll pay off old &s;cores, &s;trike a balance in my favour, and get a good wife into the bargain&mdash;There's ju&s;tice for you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Ju&s;tice with a vengeance! But why mu&s;t Sir Toby be puni&s;hed for the &s;ins of his uncle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll ea&s;e your con&s;cience there too&mdash;My mother, at my father's death, took me a boy to Sir Toby and my Lady, to &s;olicit their kindne&s;s for me&mdash;He gave me half a crown to buy ginger-bread, and her Lady&s;hip, who was combing a fat lap-dog, mutter'd&mdash;<HI>There was no end of maintaining poor relations.</HI></P>

<P>I have not a qualm left&mdash;But did you really pa&s;s for a &s;trolling player la&s;t &s;ummer, to have a pretence of being near her father's hou&s;e?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I did, and as Polonius &s;ays, <HI>was account|ed a good Actor.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could put that unaccountable frolic in your head?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>To gain the favour of Sir Toby's family, as a &s;trolling player, which I could not as a poor re|lation&mdash;they are fond of acting to madne&s;s, and my plan &s;ucceeded; I was &s;o alter'd they did not know me&mdash;they lik'd me much, came to a Bene|fit, which I pretended to have, invited me to their hou&s;e, and Mi&s;s met me privately, after I had played <HI>Ranger</HI> and <HI>Lothario.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, when a young lady's head is cram'd with combu&s;tible &s;craps of plays&mdash;&s;he is always ready prim'd, and will <HI>go off</HI> (if you will allow me a pun) the very fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I di&s;covered my&s;elf to the young lady, and her genero&s;ity was &s;o great, that &s;he re&s;olv'd to marry me to make me amends&mdash;there are refin'd feelings for you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, double refin'd!&mdash;&s;he is more romantic than you, WILL&mdash;But did not you run a great ri&s;que of lo&s;ing her, when &s;he knew you was only a gentleman, and not a player?</P>

<P><HI>I &s;hall be with my Papa and Mama to &s;ee a Re|hear&s;al at Drury-lane Playhou&s;e on Tue&s;day morning; if my pre&s;ent inclinations hold, and my heart does not fail me, I may convince hone&s;t Ranger, what confidence I have in his honour.</HI>&mdash;Po&s;t&s;cript.&mdash;<HI>If I don't &s;ee you then, I don't know when I &s;hall &s;ee you, for we return into the country next week.&mdash;</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I'll go and take mine, to help you to carry off the ven'&s;on&mdash;This is very like poaching, WILL&mdash;But how will you get admittance into Drury|lane Theatre?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was very near being di&s;appointed there, for unluckily the acting Manager, who &s;carce reach'd to my third button, cock'd up his head in my face, and &s;aid I was much too tall for a Hero&mdash;however I got the liberty of the &s;cenes by de&s;iring to rehear&s;e Hamlet next week&mdash;But I hope to cro&s;s the Tweed with the fair Ophelia before that time,

<P>Come Betty, du&s;t away, du&s;t away girl, the Managers will be here pre&s;ently; there's no lying in bed for them now, we are up early and late; all hurry and bu&s;tle from morning to night; I won|der what the deuce they have got in their heads?</P>

<P>Ay, ay, girl, they have met with their match, and we &s;hall all &s;uffer for it&mdash;for my part I can't go thro' the work, if they are always in this plaguy hurry; I have not drank a comfortable di&s;h of tea &s;ince the hou&s;e open'd.</P>
