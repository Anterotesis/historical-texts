<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE AUTHOR of the following ESSAY was &s;ol|licitous only for the honour of <HI>Shake&s;peare:</HI> he hath however, in <HI>his own</HI> capacity, little rea&s;on to complain of <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> Criticks, or Criticks <HI>by profe&s;&s;ion.</HI> The very FEW, who have been plea&s;ed to controvert any part of his Doctrine, have favoured him with better manners, than arguments; and claim his thanks for a further opportunity of demon&s;trating the futility of <HI>Theoretick</HI> rea&s;oning again&s;t <HI>Matter of Fact.</HI> It is indeed &s;trange, that any <HI>real</HI> Friends of our immortal POET &s;hould be &s;till willing to force him into a &s;ituation, which is not tenable: treat him as a <HI>learned</HI> Man, and what &s;hall excu&s;e the mo&s;t gro&s;s violations of Hi&s;tory, Chronology, and Geo|graphy?</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign"> is the Motto of every <HI>Polemick:</HI> like his Brethren at the <HI>Amphitheatre,</HI> he holds it a merit to <HI>die hard</HI>; and will not &s;ay, <HI>Enough,</HI> though the Battle be decided. "Were it &s;hewn, &s;ays &s;ome one, that the old Bard borrowed <HI>all</HI> his allu&s;ions from <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> books then publi&s;hed, our <HI>E&s;&s;ayi&s;t</HI> might have po&s;&s;ibly e&s;tabli&s;hed his Sy&s;tem."
<PB REF="4">
&mdash;In good time! &mdash;This had &s;carcely been at|tempted by <HI>Peter Burman</HI> him&s;elf, with the Library of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> before him. &mdash; "Truly, as Mr. <HI>Dogberry</HI> &s;ays, for <HI>mine own</HI> part, if I were as tedious as a King, I could find in my heart to be&s;tow it all on this Subject:" but where &s;hould I meet with a Reader? &mdash; When the main Pillars are taken away, the whole Building falls in cour&s;e: Nothing hath been, or can be, pointed out, which is not ea&s;ily removed; or rather, which was not <HI>virtually</HI> removed before: a very little <HI>Analogy</HI> will do the bu&s;ine&s;s. I &s;hall there|fore have no occa&s;ion to trouble my&s;elf any further; and may venture to call my Pamphlet, in the words of a plea&s;ant Declaimer again&s;t <HI>Sermons on the thirtieth of January,</HI> "an An&s;wer to every thing that &s;hall hereafter be written on the Subject."</P>
<P>But "this method of rea&s;oning will prove any one ignorant of the Languages, who hath written when Tran&s;lations were extant." &mdash; <HI>Shade</HI> of <HI>Burger&s;di|cius!</HI> &mdash; does it follow, becau&s;e <HI>Shake&s;peare's</HI> early life was incompatible with a cour&s;e of Education&mdash;who&s;e Contemporaries, Friends and Foes, nay, and him&s;elf likewi&s;e, agree in his want of what is u&s;ually called <HI>Literature</HI> &mdash;who&s;e mi&s;takes from equivocal Tran&s;la|tions, and even typographical Errors, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be accounted for otherwi&s;e, &mdash;that <HI>Locke,</HI> to whom not one of the&s;e circum&s;tances is applicable, under|&s;tood no <HI>Greek?</HI> &mdash;I &s;u&s;pect, <HI>Rollin's</HI> Opinion of our Philo&s;opher was not founded on this argument.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> wanted not the Stilts of Languages to rai&s;e him above all other men. The quotation from <HI>Lilly</HI> in the <HI>Taming of the Shrew,</HI> if indeed it be his, &s;trongly proves the extent of his reading: had he known <HI>Terence,</HI> he would not have quoted erroneou&s;ly
<PB REF="5">
from his <HI>Grammar.</HI> Every one hath met with men in common life, who, according to the language of the <HI>Water-poet,</HI> "got only from <HI>Po&s;&s;um</HI> to <HI>Po&s;&s;et,"</HI> and yet will throw out a line occa&s;ionally from their <HI>Accidence</HI> or their <HI>Cato de Moribus</HI> with tolerable pro|priety. &mdash; If, however, the old Editions be tru&s;ted in this pa&s;&s;age, our Author's memory &s;omewhat fail|ed him in point of <HI>Concord.</HI></P>
<P>The rage of <HI>Paralleli&s;ms</HI> is almo&s;t over, and in truth nothing can be more ab&s;urd. "THIS was &s;tolen from <HI>one</HI> Cla&s;&s;ick, &mdash; THAT from <HI>another</HI>;"&mdash; and had I not &s;tept in to his re&s;cue, poor <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> had been &s;tript as naked of ornament, as when he fir&s;t <HI>held Hor&s;es</HI> at the door of the Playhou&s;e.</P>
<P>The late ingenious and mode&s;t Mr. <HI>Dod&s;ley</HI> de|clared him&s;elf
<Q>"Untutor'd in the lore of <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Rome:"</HI></Q>
Yet let us take a pa&s;&s;age at a venture from any of his performances, and a thou&s;and to one, it is &s;tolen. Suppo&s;e it be his celebrated Compliment to the <HI>Ladies,</HI> in one of his earlie&s;t pieces, <HI>The Toy-&s;hop:</HI> "A good Wife makes the cares of the World &s;it ea&s;y, and adds a &s;weetne&s;s to its plea&s;ures; &s;he is a Man's be&s;t Companion in Pro&s;perity, and his only Friend in Adver&s;ity; the carefulle&s;t pre&s;erver of his Health, and the kinde&s;t Attendant in his Sickne&s;s; a faithful Advi&s;er in Di&s;tre&s;s, a Comforter in Afflic|tion, and a prudent Manager in all his dome&s;tic Af|fairs."&mdash;<HI>Plainly,</HI> from a fragment of <HI>Euripides</HI> pre|&s;erved by <HI>Stobaeus.</HI></P>

<P>It &s;eems however, at la&s;t, that <HI>"Ta&s;te</HI> &s;hould de|termine the matter."

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE LEARNING OF SHAKESPEARE: ADDRESSED TO JOSEPH CRADOCK, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>"SHAKESPEARE, &s;ays a Brother of the <HI>Craft,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> in his Preface to <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher,</HI> 10 Vol. 8vo. 1750.</NOTE> is a va&s;t garden of critici&s;m:" and certainly no one can be favoured with more weeders <HI>gratis.</HI></P>
<P>But how often, my dear Sir, are weeds and flowers torn up indi&s;criminately?&mdash; the ravaged &s;pot is re-planted in a moment, and a profu&s;ion of cri|tical thorns thrown over it for &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>"A prudent man therefore would not venture his fingers among&s;t them."</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="8">Be however in little pain for your friend, who re|gards him&s;elf &s;ufficiently to be cautious:&mdash;yet he a&s;|&s;erts with confidence, that no improvement can be expected, whil&s;t the natural &s;oil is mi&s;taken for a hot-bed, and the Natives of the banks of <HI>Avon</HI> are &s;cientifically choked with the culture of exoticks.</P>
<P>Thus much for metaphor; it is contrary to the <HI>Statute</HI> to fly out &s;o early: but who can tell, whe|ther it may not be demon&s;trated by &s;ome critick or other, that a deviation from rule is peculiarly happy in an E&s;&s;ay of <HI>Shake&s;peare!</HI></P>
<P>You have long known my opinion concerning the literary acqui&s;itions of our immortal Dramati&s;t; and remember how I congratulated my&s;elf on my coincidence with the la&s;t and be&s;t of his Editors. I told you however, that his <HI>&s;mall Latin and le&s;s Greek</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Ben. Jon&s;on,</HI> &s;o often quoted, is giv|en us in the admirable preface to the late Edition, with a various reading, "&s;mall Latin and <HI>no</HI> Greek," which hath been held up to the Publick for a modern &s;ophi&s;ti|cation: yet whether an error or not, it was adopted a|bove a Century ago by <HI>W. Towers</HI> in a Panegyrick on <HI>Cartwright.</HI> His Eulogy, with more than fifty others, on this now forgotten Poet, was prefixed to the Edit. 1651.</NOTE> would &s;till be litigated, and you &s;ee very a&s;&s;u|redly that I was not mi&s;taken. The trumpet hath been &s;ounded again&s;t "the darling project of repre|&s;enting <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> as one of the illiterate vulgar;" and indeed to &s;o good purpo&s;e, that I would by all means recommend the performer to the army of
<PB N="3" REF="9">
the <HI>braying Faction,</HI> recorded by <HI>Cervantes.</HI> The te&s;timony of his contemporaries is again di&s;puted; con&s;tant tradition is oppo&s;ed by flim&s;y arguments; and nothing is heard, but confu&s;ion and non&s;en&s;e. One could &s;carcely imagine this a topick very like|ly to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions: it is a&s;&s;erted by <HI>Dryden,</HI> that "tho&s;e who accu&s;e him to have wanted learn|ing, give him the greate&s;t commendation;" yet an attack upon an article of faith hath been u&s;ually re|ceived with more temper and complacence, than the unfortunate opinion, which I am about to defend.</P>
<P>But let us previou&s;ly lament with every lover of <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> that the Que&s;tion was not fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> him&s;elf: what he &s;ees intuitively, others mu&s;t arrive at by a &s;eries of proofs; and I have not time to <HI>teach</HI> with preci&s;ion: be contented therefore with a few cur&s;ory ob&s;ervations, as they may happen to ari&s;e from the Chaos of Papers, you have &s;o often laughed at, "a &s;tock &s;ufficient to &s;et up an <HI>Editor in form."</HI> I am convinced of the &s;trength of my cau&s;e, and &s;uperior to any little ad|vantage from &s;ophi&s;tical arrangements.</P>
<P>General po&s;itions without proofs will probably have no great weight on either &s;ide, yet it may not &s;eem fair to &s;uppre&s;s them: take them therefore as their authors occur to me, and we will afterward proceed to particulars.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony of <HI>Ben.</HI> &s;tands foremo&s;t; and
<PB N="4" REF="10" MS="y">
&s;ome have held it &s;ufficient to decide the contro|ver&s;y: in the warme&s;t Panegyrick, that ever was written, he apologizes<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>"Though</HI> thou had&s;t <HI>&s;mall Latin,</HI> &amp;c."</NOTE> for what <HI>he</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed the only defect in his "beloved friend,&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Soul of the age!</L>
<L>Th' applau&s;e! delight! the wonder of our &s;tage!&mdash;</L></Q>
who&s;e memory he honoured almo&s;t to idolatry:" and con&s;cious of the worth of ancient literature, like any other man on the &s;ame occa&s;ion, he rather carries his acquirements <HI>above,</HI> than <HI>below</HI> the truth. "Jealou&s;y! cries Mr. <HI>Upton</HI>; People will allow others any qualities, but tho&s;e upon which they highly value <HI>them&s;elves."</HI> Yes, where there <HI>is</HI> a competition, and the competitor formidable: but, I think, this Critick him&s;elf hath &s;carcely &s;et in op|po&s;ition the learning of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> and <HI>Jon&s;on.</HI> When a &s;uperiority is univer&s;ally granted, it by no means appears a man's literary intere&s;t to depre&s;s the re|putation of his Antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>In truth the received opinion of the pride and malignity of <HI>Jon&s;on,</HI> at lea&s;t in the earlier part of life, is ab&s;olutely groundle&s;s: at this time &s;carce a play or a poem appeared without <HI>Ben's</HI> encomium, from the original <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> to the tran&s;lator of <HI>Du Bartas.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Jon&s;on</HI> is by no means our only authority.
<PB N="5" REF="11">
<HI>Drayton</HI> the countryman and acquaintance of <HI>Shake|&s;peare,</HI> determines his excellence to the <HI>naturall Braine</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">In his Elegie on Poets and Poe&s;ie. p. 206. Fol. 1627.</NOTE> only. <HI>Digges,</HI> a wit of the town before our Poet left the &s;tage, is very &s;trong to the pur|po&s;e,
<Q><L>&mdash; "Nature only helpt him, for looke thorow</L>

<L>One phra&s;e from Greekes, not Latines imitate,</L>
<L>Nor once from vulgar Languages tran&s;late."<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">From his Poem "upon Ma&s;ter <HI>William Shake&s;peare,"</HI> intended to have been prefixed, with the other of his compo&s;ition, to the Folio of 1623; and afterward print|ed in &s;everal mi&s;cellaneous Collections: particularly the &s;purious Edition of <HI>Shake&s;peare's</HI> Poems, 1640. Some account of him may be met with in <HI>Wood's Athenae.</HI></NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Suckling</HI> oppo&s;es his <HI>ea&s;ier &s;train</HI> to the <HI>&s;weat of learned Jon&s;on. Denham</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that all he had was from <HI>old Mother-wit. His native wood-notes wild,</HI> every one remembers to be celebrated by <HI>Milton. Dryden</HI> ob&s;erves prettily enough, that "he wanted not the &s;pectacles of books to read Nature." He came out of her hand, as &s;ome one el&s;e expre&s;&s;es it, like <HI>Pallas</HI> out of <HI>Jove's</HI> head, at full growth and mature.</P>
<P>The ever memorable <HI>Hales</HI> of <HI>Eton,</HI> (who, notwith|&s;tanding his Epithet, is, I fear, almo&s;t forgotten,) had too great a knowledge both of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> and the
<PB N="6" REF="12">
Ancients to allow much acquaintance between them: and urged very ju&s;tly on the part of Genius in oppo|&s;ition to Pedantry, That "if he had not <HI>read</HI> the Cla&s;&s;icks, he had likewi&s;e not <HI>&s;tolen</HI> from them; and if any Topick was produced from a Poet of antiquity he would undertake to &s;how &s;omewhat on the &s;ame &s;ubject, at lea&s;t as well written by <HI>Shake&s;peare."</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fuller,</HI> a diligent and equal &s;earcher after truth and quibbles, declares po&s;itively, that "his learning was very little,&mdash;<HI>Nature</HI> was all the <HI>Art</HI> u&s;ed upon him, as <HI>he him&s;elf,</HI> if alive, would confe&s;s." And may we not &s;ay, he did confe&s;s it, when he apologized for his <HI>untutored lines</HI> to his noble patron the Earl of <HI>Southampton?</HI> &mdash;this li&s;t of witne&s;&s;es might be ea&s;ily enlarged; but I flatter my&s;elf, I &s;hall &s;tand in no need of &s;uch evidence.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t vehement a&s;&s;ertors of the learning of <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> was the Editor of his Poems, the well-known Mr. <HI>Gildon</HI>;<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hence perhaps the <HI>ill-&s;tar'd rage</HI> between this Critick and his elder Brother, <HI>John Dennis,</HI> &s;o pathetically la|mented in the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> Whil&s;t the former was per&s;uaded, that "the man who doubts of the Learning of <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> hath none of his own:" the latter, above regarding the attack in his <HI>private</HI> capacity, declares with great pa|triotic vehemence, that "he who allows <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> had Learning, and a familiar acquaintance with the Ancients, ought to be looked upon as a detractor from the Glory of <HI>Great Britain." Dennis</HI> was expelled his College for at|tempting to &s;tab a man in the dark: <HI>Pope</HI> would have been glad of this anecdote.</NOTE> and his &s;teps
<PB N="7" REF="13">
were mo&s;t punctually taken by a &s;ub&s;equent labourer in the &s;ame department, Dr. <HI>Sewel.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed "little ground for the common opinion of his want of learning:" once indeed he made a proper di&s;tinction between <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>lan|guages,</HI> as I would be under&s;tood to do in my Title-page; but unfortunately he forgot it in the cour&s;e of his di&s;qui&s;ition, and endeavoured to per&s;uade him&s;elf that <HI>Shake&s;peare's</HI> acquaintance with the Ancients might be actually proved by the &s;ame medium as <HI>Jon&s;on's.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Theobald</HI> is "very unwilling to allow him &s;o poor a &s;cholar, as many have laboured to repre&s;ent him;" and yet is "cautious of declaring too po&s;i|tively on the other &s;ide the que&s;tion."</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Warburton</HI> hath expo&s;ed the weakne&s;s of &s;ome arguments from <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> imitations; and yet offers others, which, I doubt not, he could as ea&s;ily have refuted.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Upton</HI> wonders "with what kind of rea&s;oning any one could be &s;o far impo&s;ed upon, as to imagine that <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> had no learning;" and la&s;hes with much zeal and &s;atisfaction "the pride and pertne&s;s of dunces, who under &s;uch a name would gladly &s;helter their own idlene&s;s and ignorance."</P>
<P>He, like the learned Knight, at every anomaly in grammar or metre,
<Q><L>"Hath hard words ready to &s;hew why,</L>
<L>And tell what <HI>Rule</HI> he did it by."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="14">How would the old Bard have been a&s;toni&s;hed to have found, that he had very &s;kilfully given the <HI>trochaic dimeter brachycatalectic,</HI> COMMONLY called the <HI>ithyphallic</HI> mea&s;ure, to the Witches in <HI>Macheth!</HI> and that now and then a halting Ver&s;e afforded a mo&s;t beautiful in&s;tance of the <HI>Pes proceleu&s;maticus!</HI></P>
<P>"But, continues Mr. <HI>Upton,</HI> it was a learned age; <HI>Roger A&s;cham</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> read more <HI>Greek</HI> every day, than &s;ome <HI>Dignitaries</HI> of the Church did <HI>Latin</HI> in a whole week." This appears very probable; and a plea&s;ant proof it is of the gene|ral learning of the times, and of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> in par|ticular. I wonder, he did not corroborate it with an extract from her injunctions to her Clergy, that "&s;uch as were but <HI>mean Readers</HI> &s;hould peru&s;e over before, once or twice, the Chapters and Homilies, to the intent they might read to the better under|&s;tanding of the people."</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Grey</HI> declares, that <HI>Shake&s;peare's</HI> knowledge in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> tongues cannot <HI>rea&s;onably</HI> be call|ed in que&s;tion. Dr. <HI>Dodd</HI> &s;uppo&s;es it <HI>proved,</HI> that he was not &s;uch a novice in learning and antiquity as <HI>&s;ome people</HI> would pretend. And to clo&s;e the whole, for I &s;u&s;pect you to be tired of quotation, Mr. <HI>Whalley,</HI> the ingenious Editor of <HI>Jon&s;on,</HI> hath written a piece expre&s;sly on this &s;ide the que&s;tion: perhaps from a very excu&s;able partiality, he was willing to draw
<PB N="9" REF="15">
<HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> from the field of Nature to cla&s;&s;ick ground, where alone, he knew, his Author could po&s;&s;ibly cope with him.</P>
<P>The&s;e criticks, and many others their coadjutors, have &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves able to trace <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> in the writings of the Ancients; and have &s;ometimes per&s;uaded us of their own learning, whatever became of their Author's. Plagiari&s;ms have been di&s;covered in every natural de&s;cription and every moral &s;enti|ment. Indeed by the kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the various <HI>Excerpta, Sententiae,</HI> and <HI>Flores,</HI> this bu&s;ine&s;s may be effected with very little expen&s;e of time or &s;agacity; as <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> hath demon&s;trated in his Comment on <HI>Chevy-chace,</HI> and <HI>Wag&s;taff</HI> on <HI>Tom Thumb:</HI> and I my|&s;elf will engage to give you quotations from the elder <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> writers (for to own the truth, I was once idle enough to collect &s;uch) which &s;hall carry with them at lea&s;t an equal degree of &s;imilarity. But there can be no occa&s;ion of wa&s;ting any future time in this de|partment: the world is now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Marks of Imitation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"Shake&s;peare</HI> however hath frequent allu&s;ions to the <HI>facts</HI> and <HI>fables</HI> of antiquity." Granted:&mdash;and as <HI>Mat. Prior</HI> &s;ays, to &s;ave the effu&s;ion of more Chri&s;tian ink, I will endeavour to &s;hew, how they came to his acquaintance.</P>
<P>It is notorious, that much of his <HI>matter of fact</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="16">
knowledge is deduced from <HI>Plutarch:</HI> but in what language he read him, hath yet been the que&s;tion.

<P>This mythology is not recollected in the Ancients, and therefore the critick hath no doubt but his Au|thor wrote <HI>"Henchman,&mdash;a Page, Pu&s;io:</HI> and <HI>this</HI> word &s;eeming too hard for the Printer, he tran&s;lated the

<P>I know it may be objected on the authority of &s;uch Biographers, as <HI>Theophilus Cibber,</HI> and the Writer of the Life of Sir <HI>Philip,</HI> prefixed to the modern Editions; that the <HI>Arcadia</HI> was not publi&s;hed before 1613, and con&s;equently too late for this imitation: but I have a Copy in my own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, printed for <HI>W.

<P>Thus likewi&s;e every word of antiquity is to be cut down to the cla&s;&s;ical &s;tandard.</P>
<P>In a Note on the Prologue to <HI>Troilus</HI> and <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> (which, by the way, is not met with in the <HI>Quarto</HI>) Mr. <HI>Theobald</HI> informs us, that the very <HI>names</HI> of the gates of <HI>Troy,</HI> have been barbarou&s;ly demoli&s;hed by the Editors: and a deal of learned du&s;t he makes in

<P>A &s;ingle word in Queen <HI>Catherine's</HI> Character of <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, is brought by the <HI>Doctor</HI> as another argument for the learning of <HI>Shake&s;peare.</HI></P>
<Q><L>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; "He was a man</L>
<L>Of an unbounded Stomach, ever ranking</L>
<L>Him&s;elf with Princes; one that by <HI>Sugge&s;tion</HI></L>
<L>Ty'd all the kingdom. Simony was fair play.</L>
<L>His own opinion was his law, i'th' pre&s;ence</L>
<L>He would &s;ay untruths, and be ever double</L>
<L>Both in his words and meaning. He was never</L>
<L>But where he meant to ruin, pitiful.</L>
<L>His promi&s;es were, as he then was, mighty;</L>
<L>But his performance, as he now is, nothing.</L>
<L>Of his own body he was ill, and gave</L>
<L>The Clergy ill example."</L></Q>
<P>The word <HI>Sugge&s;tion,</HI> &s;ays the Critick, is here u&s;ed with great propriety, and <HI>&s;eeming</HI> knowledge of the Latin tongue: and he proceeds to &s;ettle the &s;en&s;e of it from <HI>the late Roman writers and their glo&s;&s;ers.</HI> But <HI>Shake&s;peare's</HI> knowledge was from <HI>Holing&s;hed,</HI> whom he follows <HI>verbatim:</HI></P>
<P>"This Cardinal was of a great &s;tomach, for he compted him&s;elf equal with princes, and by craftie <HI>Sugge&s;tion</HI> got into his hands innumerable trea&s;ure: he forced little on &s;imonie, and was not pitifull, and
<PB N="48" REF="54">
&s;tood affectionate in his own opinion: in open pre|&s;ence he would lie and &s;eie untruth, and was double both in &s;peech and meaning: he would promi&s;e much and performe little: he was vicious of his bodie, and gaue the clergie euil example." Edit. 1587. p. 922.</P>
<P>Perhaps after this quotation, you may not think, that Sir <HI>Thomas Hanmer,</HI> who reads <HI>Tyth'd</HI> &mdash; in|&s;tead of <HI>Ty'd all the kingdom,</HI> de&s;erves quite &s;o much of Dr. <HI>Warburton's</HI> &s;everity. &mdash; Indi&s;put|ably the pa&s;&s;age, like every other in the Speech, is intended to expre&s;s the meaning of the parallel one in the Chronicle: it cannot therefore be credit|ed, that any man, when the <HI>Original</HI> was produced, &s;hould &s;till chu&s;e to defend a <HI>cant</HI> acceptation; and inform us, perhaps, <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly,</HI> that in <HI>gaming</HI> language, from I know not what practice, to <HI>tye</HI> is to <HI>equal!</HI> A &s;en&s;e of the word, as far as I have yet found, <HI>unknown</HI> to our old Writers; and, if <HI>known,</HI> would not &s;ure|ly have been u&s;ed in <HI>this</HI> place by our Author.</P>
<P>But let us turn from conjecture to <HI>Shake&s;peare's</HI> authorities. <HI>Hall,</HI> from whom the above de&s;cription is copied by <HI>Holing&s;hed,</HI> is very explicit in the de|mands of the <HI>Cardinal:</HI> who having in&s;olently told the <HI>Lord Mayor</HI> and <HI>Aldermen,</HI> "For &s;othe I thinke, that <HI>halfe</HI> your &s;ub&s;taunce were to litle," a&s;&s;ures them by way of comfort at the end of his harangue, that

<P>Mr. <HI>Upton</HI> however, in the next place, produces a pa&s;|&s;age from <HI>Henry the &s;ixth,</HI> whence he argues it to be very plain, that our Author had not only <HI>read Cicero's Offices,</HI> but even more <HI>critically</HI> than many of the Editors:
<Q><L>&mdash; "This Villain here</L>
<L>Being Captain of a <HI>Pinnace,</HI> threatens more</L>
<L>Than <HI>Bargulus,</HI> the &s;trong <HI>Illyrian</HI> Pirate."</L></Q>
So the <HI>Wight,</HI> he ob&s;erves with great exultation, is named by <HI>Cicero</HI> in the Editions of <HI>Shake&s;peare's</HI> time, "<HI>Bargulus, Illyrius</HI> latro;" tho' the mo|dern Editors have cho&s;en to call him <HI>Bardylis:</HI> &mdash; "and <HI>thus</HI> I found it in <HI>two</HI> MSS." &mdash; And <HI>thus</HI> he might have found it in <HI>two</HI> Tran&s;lations, before <HI>Shake|&s;peare</HI> was born. <HI>Robert Whytinton,</HI> 1533, calls him, <HI>"Bargulus,</HI> a Pirate upon the &s;ee of <HI>Illiry</HI>;" and <HI>Nicholas Grimald,</HI> about twenty years afterward, <HI>"Bargulus,</HI> the <HI>Illyrian</HI> Robber."<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">I have met with a Writer who tells us, that a Tran&s;|lation of the <HI>Offices</HI> was printed by <HI>Caxton,</HI> in the year 1481: but &s;uch a book never exi&s;ted.

<P>But it had been ea&s;y to have checked Mr. <HI>Upton's</HI> exultation, by ob&s;erving, that <HI>Bargulus</HI> does not ap|pear in the <HI>Quarto.</HI>&mdash; Which al&s;o is the ca&s;e with

&s;ome fragments of <HI>Latin</HI> ver&s;es, in the different <HI>Parts</HI> of this <HI>doubtful</HI> performance.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely worth mentioning, that two or three more <HI>Latin</HI> pa&s;&s;ages, which are met with in our Au|thor, are immediately tran&s;cribed from the Story or Chronicle before him.

<P>It hath lately been repeated from Mr. <HI>Guthrie's</HI> "E&s;&s;ay upon <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tragedy," that the <HI>Portrait</HI> of <HI>Macbeth's Wife</HI> is copied from <HI>Buchanan,</HI> "who&s;e &s;pirit, as well as words, is tran&s;lated into the Play of <HI>Shake&s;peare:</HI> and it had &s;ignified nothing to have pored only on <HI>Holing&s;hed</HI> for <HI>Facts."</HI> &mdash; "Animus etiam, per &s;e ferox, prope quotidianis conviciis uxoris (quae omnium con&s;iliorum ei erat con&s;cia) &s;timula|batur."&mdash; This is the whole, that <HI>Buchanan</HI> &s;ays of the <HI>Lady,</HI> and truly I &s;ee no more <HI>&s;pirit</HI> in the <HI>Scotch,</HI> than in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Chronicler. "The wordes of the three weird Si&s;ters al&s;o greatly encouraged him [to the Murder of <HI>Duncan</HI>], but &s;pecially his wife lay &s;ore upon him to attempt the thing, as &s;he that was very ambitious, brenning in unquenchable de|&s;ire to beare the name of a Queene."

<P>This part of <HI>Holing&s;hed</HI> is an Abridgment of <HI>Johne Bellenden's</HI> tran&s;lation of the <HI>noble clerk, Hector Boece, imprinted</HI> at <HI>Edingburgh,</HI> in <HI>Fol.</HI> 1541. I will give the pa&s;&s;age as it is found there. "His wyfe im|pacient of lang tary (<HI>as all wemen ar</HI>) &s;pecially quhare they ar de&s;irus of ony purpos, gaif hym gret artation to pur&s;ew the thrid weird, that &s;che micht be ane

<P>But we can <HI>demon&s;trate,</HI> that <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> had not the Story from <HI>Buchanan.</HI> According to <HI>him,</HI> the We&iuml;rd-Si&s;ters &s;alute <HI>Macbeth,</HI> "Una <HI>Angu&s;iae</HI> Tha|num, altera <HI>Moraviae,</HI> tertia <HI>Regem."</HI>&mdash;Thane of <HI>Angus,</HI> and of <HI>Murray, &amp;c.</HI> but according to <HI>Holing|&s;hed,</HI> immediately from <HI>Bellenden,</HI> as it &s;tands in <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> "The fir&s;t of them &s;pake and &s;ayde, All hayle <HI>Makbeth</HI> Thane of <HI>Glammis,</HI> &mdash; the &s;econd of them &s;aid, Hayle <HI>Makbeth</HI> Thane of <HI>Cawder</HI>; but the third &s;ayde, All hayle <HI>Makbeth,</HI> that hereafter &s;hall be <HI>king of Scotland."</HI> p. 243.

Here too our Poet found the equivocal Predictions, on which his Hero &s;o fatally depended. "He had learned of certain wy&s;ards, how that he ought to

And the Scene between <HI>Malcolm</HI> and <HI>Macduff</HI> in the fourth act is almo&s;t literally taken from the <HI>Chronicle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Macheth</HI> was certainly one of <HI>Shake&s;peare's</HI> late&s;t Productions, and it might po&s;&s;ibly have been &s;ug|ge&s;ted to him by a little performance on the &s;ame &s;ubject at <HI>Oxford,</HI> before King <HI>James,</HI> 1605. I will tran&s;cribe my notice of it from <HI>Wake's Rex Platonicus:</HI> "Fabulae an&s;am dedit antiqua de Regi&acirc; pro&s;api&acirc; hi&s;toriola apud <HI>Scoto-Britannos</HI> celebrata, quae narrat tres olim Sibyllas occurri&s;&s;e duobus <HI>Scotiae</HI> proceribus, <HI>Macbetho</HI> &amp; <HI>Banchoni,</HI> &amp; illum praedixi&s;&s;e Regem fu|turum, &s;ed Regem nullum geniturum; hunc Regem non futurum, &s;ed Reges geniturum multos.

<P>We may ob&s;erve in general, that the early Edi|tions have not half the quantity; and every &s;entence, or rather every word mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly blundered. The&s;e, for &s;everal rea&s;ons, could not po&s;&s;ibly be pub|li&s;hed by the Author;<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><P>Every writer on <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> hath expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;to|ni&s;hment, that his author was not &s;olicitous to &s;ecure his Fame by a correct Edition of his performances. This matter is not under&s;tood. When a Poet was connected with a particular Playhou&s;e, he con&s;tantly &s;old his Works to the <HI>Company,</HI> and it was their intere&s;t to keep them from a number of Rivals. A favourite Piece, as <HI>Heywood</HI> informs us, only got into print, when it was copied <HI>by the ear,</HI> "for a double &s;ale would bring on a &s;upicion of hone&s;tie." <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> therefore him&s;elf publi&s;hed nothing in the <HI>Drama:</HI> when he left the Stage, his copies re|mained with his Fellow-Managers, <HI>Heminge</HI> and <HI>Condell</HI>; who at their own retirement, about &s;even years after the death of the Author, gave the world the Edition now known by the name of the <HI>fir&s;t Folio</HI>; and call the pre|vious publications "&s;tolne and &s;urreptitious, maimed and deformed by the frauds and &s;tealths of injurious im|po&s;tors." But <HI>this</HI> was printed from the Playhou&s;e Copies; which in a &s;eries of years had been frequently altered thro' convenience, caprice, or ignorance. We have a &s;ufficient in&s;tance of the liberties taken by the Actors, in an old pamphlet, by <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> called <HI>Lenten Stuffe, with the Pray&s;e of the red Herring,</HI> 4to. 1599. where he a&s;&s;ures us, that in a Play of his, called the <HI>I&s;le of Dogs, "foure acts,</HI> without his con&s;ent, or the lea&s;t gue&s;&s;e of his drift or &s;cope, were &s;upplied by the Players."</P><P>This however was not his fir&s;t quarrel with them. In the Epi&s;tle prefixed to <HI>Greene's Arcadia,</HI> which I have quoted before, <HI>Tom.</HI> hath a la&s;h at &s;ome "vaine glorious Tragedians," and very plainly at <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> in particu|lar; which will &s;erve for an an&s;wer to an ob&s;ervation of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> that had almo&s;t been forgotten: "It was thought a prai&s;e to <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> that he &s;carce ever blot|ted a line: &mdash; I believe the common opinion of his want of learning proceeded from no better ground. This too might be thought a <HI>prai&s;e</HI> by &s;ome." &mdash; But hear <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> who was far from <HI>prai&s;ing:</HI> "I leaue all the&s;e to the mer|cy of their <HI>Mother-tongue,</HI> that feed on nought but the crums that fall from the <HI>Tran&s;lator's</HI> trencher. &mdash; That could &s;carcely <HI>Latinize</HI> their neck ver&s;e if they &s;hould haue neede, yet <HI>Engli&s;h Seneca</HI> read by Candlelight yeelds many good &s;entences &mdash; hee will affoord you whole <HI>Hamlets,</HI> I &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Handfuls</HI> of tragicall &s;peeches." &mdash;I cannot determine exactly when this <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> was fir&s;t publi&s;hed; but, I fancy, it will carry the original <HI>Ham|let</HI> &s;omewhat further back than we have hitherto done: and it may be ob&s;erved, that the olde&s;t Copy now extant is &s;aid to be "Enlarged to almo&s;t as much againe as it was." <HI>Gabriel Harvey</HI> printed at the end of the year 1592, "Foure Letters and certaine Sonnetts, e&s;pecially touch|ing <HI>Robert Greene:"</HI> in one of which his <HI>Arcadia</HI> is men|tioned.

that the <HI>French</HI> ribaldry was at fir&s;t in&s;erted by a dif|ferent hand, as the many additions mo&s;t certainly were after he had left the Stage. &mdash; Indeed, every

<P>Mr. <HI>Hawkins,</HI> in the Appendix to Mr. <HI>John&s;on's</HI> Edition, hath an ingenious ob&s;ervation to prove, that <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>French</HI> to be his, had very little knowledge of the language.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> makes a doubt, whether the pro|nunciation of the French language may not be changed, &s;ince <HI>Shake&s;peare's</HI> time, "if not, &s;ays he, it may be &s;u&s;pected that &s;ome other man wrote the <HI>French</HI> &s;cenes:" but this does not appear to be the ca&s;e, at lea&s;t in this termination, from the rules of the Grammarians, or the practice of the Poets.

there were more than one before our Poet's. &mdash; In <HI>Pierce Penile&s;&s;e his Supplication to the Diuell,</HI> 4to. 1592.

"How would it haue joyed braue <HI>Talbot</HI> (the terror of the <HI>French</HI>) to thinke that after he had lyen two hundred yeare in his Toomb, he &s;hould triumph again on the Stage; and haue his bones new em|balmed with the teares of ten thou&s;and &s;pectators at lea&s;t (at &s;euerall times) who in the Tragedian that repre&s;ents his per&s;on, imagine they behold him fre&s;h bleeding."&mdash;I have no doubt but <HI>Henry the &s;ixth</HI> had the &s;ame Author with <HI>Edward the third,</HI> which hath been recovered to the world in Mr. <HI>Capell's Prolu&s;ions.</HI></P>

<P>According to the Articles of agreement between the Conqueror <HI>Henry</HI> and the King of <HI>France,</HI> the latter was to &s;tile the former, (in the corrected <HI>French</HI> of the modern Editions,) "No&s;tre <HI>tres cher</HI> filz <HI>Henry</HI> Roy d' <HI>Angleterre</HI>; and in <HI>Latin, Praeclari&s;&s;imus</HI> Filius, &amp;c."

<PB N="91" REF="97">
in <HI>Holing&s;hed,</HI> which <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> copied; but mu&s;t in|di&s;putably have corrected, had he been acquainted with the languages. &mdash; "Our &s;aid Father, during his life, &s;hall name, call, and write us in <HI>French</HI> in this maner: No&s;tre <HI>tres chier</HI> filz, <HI>Henry</HI> Roy d' <HI>Engleterre</HI> &mdash; and in <HI>Latine</HI> in this maner, <HI>Praeclari&s;&s;imus</HI> filius no&s;ter."

hath given us by accident the word <HI>Moother</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Brother</HI>; as it is in the Original, and ought to be in <HI>Shake&s;peare.</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">I cannot take my leave of <HI>Holing&s;hed</HI> without clearing up a difficulty, which hath puzzled his Biographers. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> and other Writers have <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> him a <HI>Clergyman. Tanner</HI> goes further, and tells us, that he was educated at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and actually took the Degree of M. A. in 1544. &mdash; Yet it appears by his Will, printed by <HI>Hearne,</HI> that at the end of life he was only a <HI>Steward,</HI> or a <HI>Ser|vant</HI> in &s;ome capacity or other, to <HI>Thomas Burdett</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Bromcote</HI> in <HI>Warwick&s;hire.</HI> &mdash; The&s;e things Dr. <HI>Camp|bell</HI> could not reconcile. The truth is, we have no claim to the education of the <HI>Chronicler:</HI> the M. A. in 1544, was not <HI>Raphael,</HI> but one <HI>Ottiwell Holing&s;hed,</HI> who was afterward named by the Founder one of the fir&s;t Fellows of <HI>Trinity College.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>I hope, my good Friend, you have by this time acquitted our great Poet of all piratical depredations on the Ancients, and are ready to receive my <HI>Con|clu&s;ion.</HI> &mdash; He remembered perhaps enough of his <HI>&s;chool-boy</HI> learning to put the <HI>Hig, hag, hog,</HI> into the mouth of Sir <HI>Hugh Evans</HI>; and might pick up in the Writers of the time, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>A&s;cham</HI> in the Epi&s;tle prefixed to his <HI>Toxophilus,</HI> 1571, ob&s;erves of them, that "Manye <HI>Engli&s;he</HI> writers, u&s;inge &s;traunge wordes, as <HI>Lattine, Frenche,</HI> and <HI>Italian,</HI> do make all thinges darke and harde. Ones, &s;ays he, I communed with a man which rea&s;oned the <HI>Engli&s;he</HI> tongue to be en|riched and encrea&s;ed thereby, &s;ayinge: Who will not pray&s;e that fea&s;t, where a man &s;hall drincke at a dinner both wyne, ale, and beere? Truly (quoth I) they be al good, euery one taken by him&s;elfe alone, but if you put Malme&s;ye, and &s;acke, redde wyne and white, ale and beere, and al in one pot, you &s;hall make a drinke neither ea&s;ye to be knowen, nor yet hol&s;ome for the bodye."</NOTE> or the cour&s;e of his con|ver&s;ation

a familiar phra&s;e or two of <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Italian:</HI> but his <HI>Studies</HI> were mo&s;t demon&s;tratively confined to <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>his own Language.</HI></P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this di&s;qui&s;ition, you have often &s;miled at "all &s;uch reading, as was never read:" and po&s;&s;ibly I may have indulged it too far: but it is the reading nece&s;&s;ary for a Comment on <HI>Shake&s;peare.</HI> Tho&s;e who apply &s;olely to the Ancients for this pur|po&s;e, may with equal wi&s;dom &s;tudy the TALMUD for an Expo&s;ition of TRISTRAM SHANDY. Nothing but an intimate acquaintance with the Writers of the time, who are frequently of no other value, can point out his allu&s;ions, and a&s;certain his Phra&s;eology. The Reformers of his Text are for ever equally po|&s;itive, and equally wrong. The Cant of the Age, a provincial Expre&s;&s;ion, an ob&s;cure Proverb, an ob&s;o|lete Cu&s;tom, a Hint at a Per&s;on or a Fact no longer remembered, hath continually defeated the be&s;t of our <HI>Gue&s;&s;ers:</HI> You mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e me to &s;peak at random, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that from &s;ome forgot|ten book or other, I can demon&s;trate this to you in many hundred Places; and I almo&s;t wi&s;h, that I had not been per&s;uaded into a different Employment.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="101">Tho' I have as much of the <HI>Natale Solum</HI> about me, as any man what&s;oever; yet, I own, the <HI>Prim|ro&s;e Path</HI> is &s;till more plea&s;ing than the <HI>Fo&s;&s;e</HI> or the <HI>Watling Street:</HI>
<Q><L>"Age cannot wither it, nor cu&s;tom &s;tale</L>
<L>It's infinite variety." &mdash;</L></Q>
And when I am fairly rid of the Du&s;t of topogra|phical Antiquity, which hath continued much longer about me than I expected; you may very probably be troubled again with the ever fruitful Subject of SHAKESPEARE and his COMMENTATORS.</P>
