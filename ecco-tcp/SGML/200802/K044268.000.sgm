<HEAD>AN ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>I OFFER the following Comedy to the public, under a circum&s;tance which has given my mind the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite unea&s;ine&s;s. On the morning after the fir&s;t repre&s;entation, it was ob&s;erved by the papers that there had been per&s;ons pre&s;ent at the Theatre the pre|ceding evening, who went there <HI>determined</HI> to di&s;approve at all events. From &s;uch a de|termination it is hard indeed to e&s;cape! And the oppo&s;ition intended, was ju&s;tified it &s;eems, by the indecency of &s;ome of the expre&s;&s;ions. &mdash;From &s;uch a charge I feel it impo&s;&s;ible to defend my&s;elf; for again&s;t an imputation like this, even <HI>vindication</HI> becomes di&s;graceful!</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">As I was not at the Theatre, I &s;hould have had &s;ome difficulty in under&s;tanding at what pa&s;&s;ages the objections were levelled, had not one of the papers recorded them, with many cruel remarks. The particulars which were thus pointed out, will, I tru&s;t, be a &s;ufficient apology for them&s;elves. In the following pages they are <HI>all</HI> re&s;tored; that the public AT LARGE may have the power to adjudge me, as well as that &s;mall part of it, confined within the walls of a Theatre.</P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages have not been re&s;tored from any pertinacious opinion of their beauty&mdash; for other expre&s;&s;ions might have conveyed my intention as well; but had I allowed one line to &s;tand as altered for the &s;tage, what might not that reprobated line have been &s;uppo&s;ed to expre&s;s? I &s;hrink from the idea! And therefore mo&s;t &s;olemnly aver, that the Comedy, as now printed, contains EVERY WORD which was oppo&s;ed the fir&s;t night, from the &s;u&s;picion of indelicacy; hoping their <HI>obvious</HI> meaning only will be attended to, without the coar&s;e ingenuity of &s;trained explanations; which
<PB N="v" REF="4">
have been made, by per&s;ons who &s;eem de&s;irous to &s;urround my ta&s;k of dramatic writing, with as many difficulties as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>A celebrated Critic, more attended to for the di&s;crimination and learning which appear in his &s;trictures, than for their <HI>lenity</HI>; in his ob&s;ervations on the Greybeards, has the fol|lowing.</P>
<P><Q>When Mrs. Cowley gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;pirit and turn of a character, &s;he &s;peaks the language of <HI>that</HI> character better than <HI>any</HI> of her dramatic cotemporaries.</Q></P>
<P>This, I confe&s;s, I hold to be very high prai&s;e; and it is to this very prai&s;e, which my cotemporaries re&s;olve I &s;hall have no claim. They will allow me, indeed, to draw &s;trong character, but it mu&s;t be without &s;peaking its language. I may give vulgar o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> low bred per&s;ons, but they mu&s;t conver&s;e in a &s;tile of elegance. I may de&s;ign the coarie&s;t manners, or the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting folly, but its expre&s;&s;ions mu&s;t not deviate from the line of
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
politene&s;s. Surely it would be as ju&s;t to exact from the Arti&s;ts who are painting the Gallery of Shake&s;peare, that they &s;hould compleat their de&s;igns without the u&s;e of light and &s;hade.</P>
<P>It cannot be the <HI>Poet</HI>'s mind, which the public de&s;ire to trace, in dramatic repre&s;enta|tion; but the mind of the <HI>characters,</HI> and the truth of their colouring. Yet in my ca&s;e it &s;eems re&s;olved that the point to be con|&s;idered, is not whether that <HI>dotard,</HI> or that <HI>pretender,</HI> or that <HI>coquet,</HI> would &s;o have given their feelings, but whether Mrs. <HI>Cowley</HI> ought &s;o to have expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This is a criterion which happily no author is &s;ubjected to, but tho&s;e of the drama. The Noveli&s;t may u&s;e the bolde&s;t tints;&mdash; &s;eizing Nature for her guide, &s;he may dart through every rank of &s;ociety, drag forth not only the accompli&s;hed, but the ignorant, the coar&s;e, and the vulgar-rich; di&s;play them in their &s;tronge&s;t colours, and &s;natch immor|tality both for them, and for her&s;elf! I, on
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
the contrary, feel encompa&s;&s;ed with chains when I write, which check me in my hap|pie&s;t flights, and force me continually to re|flect, not, whether <HI>this is ju&s;t?</HI> but, whether <HI>this is &s;afe?</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are vain regrets, which I hope my readers will pardon me, for having a moment indulged. I now ha&s;ten to that part of the Comedy which will be found in the following &s;heets, as <HI>altered</HI> for the &s;econd repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>The idea of the bu&s;ine&s;s which concerns Antonia, Henry, and Ga&s;per was pre&s;ented to me in an ob&s;olete Comedy; the work of a poet of the drama, once highly celebrated. I &s;ay the <HI>idea,</HI> for when it is known that in the original the &s;cene lay among&s;t traders in the city of London&mdash;and tho&s;e traders of the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t dete&s;table manners, it will be conceived at once, that in removing it to Portugal, and fixing the characters among&s;t the nobility, it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to carry with me <HI>more</HI> than the idea. The circum|&s;tance which mo&s;t particularly intere&s;ted me,
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
and fixed it&s;elf in my mind, was that of &s;natching a young woman from a hateful marriage, the moment before that marrige became valid&mdash;that is to &s;ay, after the cere|mony. This very circum&s;tance to which the Comedy owes its exi&s;tence, was that, which &s;ome of the audience found di&s;cordant to their feelings. An event which had in the la&s;t century been &s;tampt with the highe&s;t applau&s;e, (tho' &s;urrounded by many repul&s;ive circum&s;tances) was found in this, to be ill|conceived. I did not, however, di&s;pute the deci&s;ion of my Critics,&mdash;and the marriage has been in cour&s;e di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>The manner in which the Comedy has &s;ince been received, gives room to &s;uppo&s;e that the alteration is approved. It has &s;truggled with many oppre&s;&s;ive circum&s;tances: the cha&s;m in the performance, occa&s;ioned by the repeated illne&s;s of Mr. Par&s;ons, was &s;ufficient to have &s;unk it;&mdash;but neither that, nor the &s;terile month of December, always <HI>again&s;t</HI> the Theatres, has prevented its being di&s;|tingui&s;hed by many brilliant and crouded
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
nights. I now re&s;ign it to the clo&s;et, where without the aid of fine acting, or the fa&s;ci|nations of beauty, and deriving all its little force from the pen which compo&s;ed it, it hopes &s;till to amu&s;e;&mdash;the innocent flame of Seraphina's coquetry may &s;till &s;hed rays of delight on her readers, and the affecting &s;itu|ation of Antonia intere&s;t them.</P>

<P>I am di&s;cover'd then&mdash;Oh Donna Clara! your faithle&s;s cou&s;in.</P>

<SPEAKER>Donna Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faithle&s;s, has &s;he been?</P>

<SPEAKER>Don Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is &s;he not this day to be married?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Donna Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I think &s;o, Signor, or I am not a bridemaid; but how far faithle&s;s I know not&mdash;for I return'd from Arragon la&s;t night, after more than a year's ab&s;ence. We met but an hour &s;ince in the church, nor have we yet had time for conver&s;ation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I entreat you let this di&s;|covery re&s;t with your&s;elf.&mdash;It is of the la&s;t im|portance to me, that I &s;hould not be known to Don Ga&s;per; and at pre&s;ent, I would be equally concealed from Antonia.</P>

<PB N="17" REF="28">
<SPEAKER>Donna Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t give me rea&s;ons for this reque&s;t; for I am not certain that I ought not in&s;tantly to betray you. It is true, you have been her lover, but &s;he is now to be the wife of Don Ga&s;per;&mdash;her duties to him will be of the mo&s;t &s;acred &s;ort, and &s;he mu&s;t fulfil them &s;crupulou&s;ly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think me not a &s;educer! I have lov'd Antonia for her purity and virtue; and to de&s;troy <HI>her</HI> honour, would be to trample on my own. Oh Clara! few have lov'd as I do. My pa&s;&s;ion is mingled with the tender protecting af|fection of a brother; and violation is impo&s;&s;ible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Donna Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray then tell me&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hall know all;&mdash;and &s;hould Antonia's marriage be voluntary, I will take no revenge but to leave her;&mdash;but if, as her melan|choly allows me to hope, &s;he has been deceiv'd into it, there's not a power on earth that can divide us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Donna Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your de&s;ign is not contrary to rectitude, be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall not oppo&s;e it. Follow me to a more di&s;tant room&mdash;a new &s;ecret is almo&s;t as delightful as a new lover.

<P>COME along, my charming hu&s;band! Ble&s;s me, what eloquence and fire, con&s;idering you are fifty-nine! I prote&s;t, a man thirty years younger could hardly have found &s;uch a variety of things to have &s;aid on &s;o trivial a &s;ubject.

<P>Nothing! what is it nothing that when|ever I go out of the door, your head is directly out of the window&mdash;like the &s;ign of Queen Jezebel? 'Tis known to all the impudent young face-hunters in Li&s;bon, who &s;aunter about my gates, like wolves before a &s;heep-fold&mdash;d'ye call that nothing?</P>

<SPEAKER>Seraph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no; Heaven forbid I &s;hould be &s;o ungrateful towards the grand plea&s;ure of my life! Nothing! 'tis <HI>every thing</HI>&mdash;my happine&s;s! I wait for &s;un&s;et every day with impatience, becau&s;e 'tis known that I then mount my throne&mdash;that is, I enter my balcony, and &s;ee new pro&s;trate &s;ubjects adoring, and deifying me.</P>

<P>Zounds! what a vile cu&s;tom it was to build hou&s;es with windows! I'll have them all block'd up. Sky-lights are the only things for a Chri&s;tian country.&mdash;Windows and balconies!&mdash; they are fit only for Turki&s;h baths, and public brothels.</P>

<SPEAKER>Seraph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Li&s;ten, Deary! and I'll ble&s;s ye with a &s;ecret. Blind your windows, and nail your doors, but if your honour
<STAGE>(<HI>curt&s;eying</HI>)</STAGE>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seraph.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>My</HI> honour! Rely on that, and I &s;wear to you by every thing &s;acred, that no ve&s;tal's life &s;hall be more blamele&s;s. It is due to my own feelings to be cha&s;te&mdash;I don't conde&s;cend to think of yours in the affair. The re&s;pect I bear my&s;elf, makes me nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;erve my purity&mdash;but if I am &s;u&s;pected, watch'd, and haunted, I know not but &s;uch torment may weary me out of prin|ciples, which I have hitherto cheri&s;h'd as my life.</P>

<P>Mercy! who can it be, but old, &s;hrivell'd, grey-pated Time? To <HI>his</HI> negative I &s;hall yield&mdash; but with a very ill will, I a&s;&s;ure you. If the pa&s;&s;ion we have for admiration is wrong, let nature look to it&mdash;'twas &s;he impre&s;s'd it on our hearts;

<P>Why to &s;ay truth, one is a &s;ort of a paradox. At a tale of woe, I melt like Niobe; and am agoniz'd at di&s;tre&s;s, if I cannot relieve it; &mdash;yet a lover's mi&s;ery is delightful!
