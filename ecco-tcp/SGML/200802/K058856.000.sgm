<HEAD>MODERN ANECDOTE.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>IN the centre of Germany lived a Baron, the only male &s;urvivor and heir to the ancient family of the Kinkvervankot&s;dar&s;prakengotchderns, which re&s;pectable name has &s;unk with him into the grave.</P>
<P>His pedigree might have been valued by the ell, and vied in
<PB N="2" REF="13">
antiquity with &s;ome of the &s;uperb Welch, who trace their forefathers up to Adam, <Q REND="inline">"who was the &s;on of O;"</Q> meaning by that round O, the Su|preme Being.</P>
<P>That my reader may not break his teeth by articulating the name of our Baron; nor my readers hearers the tympanum of their ears, by li&s;tening to its uncouth &s;ound; we will call him only, the Baron.</P>
<P>The Baron then was, like all Barons in Germany, or el&s;ewhere, where Barons exi&s;t, proud and poor:
<PB N="3" REF="14">
not that he had manors to be proud of, or manners enough to &s;quander away his pence; for he had neither land or money, more than would ju&s;t &s;erve to keep famine out of his ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>His ca&s;tle, indeed, boa&s;ted of more than only a door and windows; for the walls of his hall were hung from the cieling to the floor; his parlours were likewi&s;e hung; his bedchambers, and the clo&s;ets belonging to them were hung; the garrets; nay, the very &s;tair|ca&s;e was hung all over with family pictures.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="15">
Family pictures! cries Mr. Grum|blemore, a very intere&s;ting piece of news indeed: nay, good Mr. Grum|blemore, replace the &s;pectacles upon that &s;hort no&s;e of yours, nor think the family pictures unnece&s;&s;ary, or u&s;e|le&s;s in my narrative; for now, upon them depend the whole life of it; they are to be the occa&s;ion of all the grief, plea&s;antry, and joy in it. Nay, dear &s;ir, keep on your two gla&s;s eyes, I be&s;eech you, and proceed: and may your ance&s;tors (if ance&s;tors you have) &s;erve your progeny (if progeny you have) as &s;upporters in the day of trouble; may their number increa&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="16">
their value; may they be as a foot|&s;tool to rai&s;e them up to joy.</P>
<P>Now, &s;ir, as no Grumblemore ever liked a digre&s;&s;ion; and the rotundity of your face, makes me think you like a pun; by going patiently on to the end of the book, you will find this little digre&s;&s;ion is a pun. You hate a pun, &s;ay you: well then, &s;ir, read this as an addre&s;s to all the Grumble|more's exi&s;ting, and I will proceed in my narrative:</P>
<P>Excepting his chaplain, his daughter Cecil, and a di&s;tant relation of his,
<PB N="6" REF="17">
that pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the year with him; the Baron's family pictures were the only human faces he ever &s;aw: therefore, they were not only his pride, but his comfort; as they con|&s;tituted the greate&s;t part of his &s;ociety. We will leave him to revolve over in his own mind the heroic deeds, and victorious actions of this &s;ilent part of his company; and confine a de&s;cription to the three living per&s;ons mentioned.</P>
<P>The curate of his pari&s;h, was dig|nified with the title of chaplain, be|cau&s;e it was right that a Baron &s;hould
<PB N="7" REF="18">
have one, to read prayers on a Sun|day morning in the chapel of the ca&s;tle, and &s;ay grace over the beef and &s;ourcrout at dinner. This chap|lain knew all the duties of one, and eat, and &s;aid Amen to every di&s;h the Baron made him ta&s;te of, with a &s;a|cerdotal benignity. The Baron's toads, indeed, did not co&s;t him much to &s;wallow; for li&s;tening patiently to the merits of the ance&s;tors, who &s;tared on canvas round the room, was all that was enquired of him.</P>
<P>The di&s;tant relation, was a man who had &s;erved with &s;ome degree of repu|tation
<PB N="8" REF="19">
in the army, in the younger part of his life: but finding, that in his country as in every other, intere&s;t promotes fa&s;ter than merit; he had at five and thirty &s;old his commi&s;&s;ion, and given him&s;elf up to &s;hooting all day at bea&s;ts and birds, in&s;tead of men; and reading all night, the won|derful romances of ancient chivalry, till he had almo&s;t per&s;uaded him&s;elf that he was an unfortunate Knight, frowned on by the lady of his heart, with the &s;ame degree of cruelty that Dame Fortune had treated him with. Numberle&s;s were the ca&s;tles he had built about this fair dam&s;el; and
<PB N="9" REF="20">
when he &s;lept, her charms pre&s;ented them&s;elves to his mind: nor were his hopes (if unrequited love can hope) &s;o very romantic; as his pa&s;&s;ion had for its object the Baron's daughter, who neither frowned nor &s;miled upon him. There was no chance, indeed, that any nobleman would marry her, as then the German nobility, like all other in Europe, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to them&s;elves, preferred a long pur&s;e to a long pedigree. The Baron was an exception to this modern way of think|ing, and would not have con&s;ented to his own daughter's contaminating her blood with one more ignobly born
<PB N="10" REF="21">
than her&s;elf; for the&s;e good rea&s;ons, and &s;ome calculations more relative to the fle&s;h than the high &s;pirit of his cou&s;in the Baron, Hogre&s;ten (for that was his name) imagined that a time would come, when Cecil would chu&s;e to have a hu&s;band; and that he might wear that happy title, he &s;pared no attentions, no re&s;pects, no gallantrics, &s;uch as he read of, practi&s;ed in the days of knight-errantry, and that he could afford, to win in &s;ilence the heart of the young and beauteous Cecil; who&s;e words melted; who&s;e looks burned; who&s;e manner inno|cently-tender in&s;pired love; and yet
<PB N="11" REF="22">
who&s;e malicious vivacity awed uncon|ciou&s;ly the ri&s;ing flame.</P>
<P>Venus &s;hould lend a feather from the wing of one of her favourite doves, to make a pen worthy of tracing Cecil's figure. Nay! the Godde&s;s her&s;elf <HI>&s;hould</HI> dictate a new language to expre&s;s her countenance. But as that <HI>&s;hould,</HI> with many others, is impo&s;&s;ible in humble mortal &s;train, I mu&s;t de&s;cribe her.</P>
<P>Cecil was above the common &s;ize of women; but her limbs were &s;o delicately turned, her proportions were &s;o ju&s;t, that whoever &s;aw her
<PB N="12" REF="23">
refu&s;ed to u&s;e the word <HI>tall</HI> in de&s;cri|bing, or thinking of her; though in fact &s;he was &s;o.</P>
<P>She had very blue eyes, which are very uncommon things; as mo&s;t blue eyes, &s;o called, are grey. But the&s;e were blue; ju&s;t two &s;hades deeper than the beauteous canopy of heaven. When &s;he &s;miled, which was often, tho&s;e eyes were lo&s;t under a pair of deep|fringed eyelids. Her eyebrows arched, were of the &s;ame colour as her eye|lids, the darke&s;t brown. Her forehead was low, and whither than alaba&s;ter; ornamented with a quantity of hair
<PB N="13" REF="24">
that was almo&s;t fair, which covered her head in &s;uch profu&s;ion, that it hung below her knees. Her no&s;e was &s;mall, though high, and rather promi|nent. Her cheeks might have been &s;u&s;pected of art in the colouring, if nature had not proved the tran&s;parency of it, by having diffu&s;ed about half a dozen freckles under each eye. Ten little dimples played about a mouth, which a fine &s;et of &s;mall teeth made more beautiful than was quite nece&s;|&s;ary; as her mouth was &s;mall, and &s;eldom &s;hewed them. Cecil, with this per&s;on, was but nineteen years old. She had been from the age of fourteen
<PB N="14" REF="25">
(when her mother died; and dying, de&s;ired &s;he might be fini&s;hed in her education in a convent at Paris) taught all the graces that art can improve talents with.</P>
<P>She danced, &s;he &s;ung, &s;he played upon the harp like a mu&s;e. And the natural gaiety of her heart made her &s;upport, without a &s;igh, for &s;ix months, the &s;ilent &s;pectators of her amu&s;ements. For the Baron, Hogre&s;ten, and the curate, neither partook of, nor ap|plauded her talents. The fir&s;t through fear, the &s;econd ditto, and the third ditto. Likewi&s;e, the Baron was afraid
<PB N="15" REF="26">
&s;he would prefer talents to birth;&mdash;Hogre&s;ten was afraid &s;he &s;hould prefer them to him;&mdash;and the curate was afraid of &s;aying what he thought about them, if he ever thought about them at all, which I doubt. How long &s;he would have borne patiently, and without <HI>Ennui,</HI> the &s;ociety of three per&s;ons, who &s;eemed to be no more animated with what animated her, than the ance&s;tors in e&s;&s;igy were, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly gue&s;s; if the arrival of &s;ome unexpected vi&s;itors at the ca&s;tle had not entirely deranged the whole pro|ceedings of its inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="27">
Why the ca&s;tle had vi&s;itors at all, I mu&s;t inform my reader, by telling him &s;ome anecdotes concerning, Cecil's mother, the effect of who&s;e good qua|lities la&s;ted beyond the grave. For, though an amiable Barone&s;s, &s;he boa&s;ted of a friend, one who had been &s;uch to her from her earlie&s;t days. Cecil's mother had been brought up in a convent in France, far from the pre&s;ence of a rigid father, who only &s;aw her at fifteen years old, to order her to marry the Baron; who took her without a fortune, becau&s;e &s;he was well born. She con&s;ented to be mar|ried, becau&s;e &s;he knew not what being
<PB N="17" REF="28">
married was: which is the rea&s;on why nine married ladies out of ten are &s;o; particularly young ones. Pray, reader, a&s;k your wife if this is not true; for I would not have my amiable Barone&s;s appear le&s;s rea&s;onable than the re&s;t of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>But to return: The only thing &s;he was &s;orry to quit in the convent, was her play fellow, Maria; who fondly put her arms round her neck, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Madame la Baronne will forget me!" "Oh! never, never, my &s;weet Maria."</Q> With mutual a&s;&s;urances of affection, they parted; and the Barone&s;s gave a
<PB N="18" REF="29">
commi&s;&s;ion to Maria, to make proper compliments to all the convent, and her vi&s;itors. She had but few indeed of the&s;e, her relations being the only per&s;ons her father permitted her to &s;ee. Among them was a young officer, the &s;on of a rich farmer-general; he was taught to look upon his young cou&s;in as a &s;uperior being in point of rank: but his heart acknowledged a more powerful &s;uperiority, which the Baron|e&s;s's eyes had involuntarily gained over his heart.</P>
<P>They &s;ung, they laughed, and talked many an hour away through the grate,
<PB N="19" REF="30">
before they were old enough to di&s;tin|gui&s;h what irre&s;i&s;tible power brought the young cou&s;in &s;o often to the parlour. Maria, who was always a partaker in their innocent mirth, thought indeed &s;he &s;aw &s;ome fire warmer than that of con&s;anguinity alone, fla&s;h from the eyes of Captain Franzel; who was run|ning the ri&s;ks of his fir&s;t campaign, when his cou&s;in was married. At his return, he flew to the beloved grate: Maria alone came to receive him. The cu|rio&s;ity natural to girls prompted her to watch his face, when &s;he abruptly told him of his cou&s;in's new title.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="31">
Married! married!&mdash;was all he could &s;ay for &s;ome time. His pa&s;&s;ion, which ab&s;ence had increa&s;ed, agitated him &s;o violently, that Maria's gentle heart run over through her eyes; and &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! you are mad."</Q> He &s;natched her hand through the grate, and ki&s;&s;ing it, a&s;ked her in pity to tell him, what &s;aid the Barone&s;s. Two hours were &s;pent that day, in talking over the virtues of the la&s;t compa|nion. He returned again and again; and Maria and him grew &s;o intere&s;ted in one another's conver&s;ation, that they agreed to marry at la&s;t, that they might comfort one another for their
<PB N="21" REF="32">
mutual lo&s;s. And, perhaps, they were the only couple who could boa&s;t after an union of many years, that their con|ver&s;ation never became in&s;ipid. Nor is it, dear ladies, &s;o bad a method to pur&s;ue, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s the con|fidence and e&s;teem of your hu&s;bands, to make them believe, you can con|tent your&s;elves with &s;eeing them in love with another object.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their confidence and e&s;teem, you give them no temp|tation to deceive you; and you keep that horrid fiend Jealou&s;y, from &s;owing di&s;&s;ention between you. But, I be|lieve,
<PB N="22" REF="33">
it is my philanthropy that made all the&s;e reflections for Maria; who, Maria no longer, but Madame Fran|zel now, was one of tho&s;e happy com|po&s;itions, made up of tenderne&s;s and humility; but who never reflected upon tho&s;e virtues at all. She was &s;atisfied with holding the &s;econd place in her hu&s;band's heart; &s;he was of &s;o cheerful a di&s;po&s;ition, that whatever misfortune happened, &s;he could find a comfort near it.</P>
<P>Her hu&s;band died about thirteen years after they had lived together in harmony, leaving her an only &s;on.
<PB N="23" REF="34">
About this time her friend, the Barone&s;s, wrote to her to borrow &s;ome money, which her hu&s;band was too proud to own he wanted. The year following &s;he died, leaving her picture to Madame Franzel, and a charge to her to watch, that her only daughter's happine&s;s &s;hould not be &s;acrificed to Family Pride.</P>
<P>Madame Franzel had vi&s;ited the young Cecil con&s;tantly, while &s;he re|mained in her convent at Paris; and had often related to her the hi&s;tory of her hu&s;band's pa&s;&s;ion for her mother; &s;hewing her, with her accu&s;tomed vi|vacity, the Barone&s;s's picture, which &s;he
<PB N="24" REF="35">
wore on one wri&s;t, and Captain Fran|zel's on the other; &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"See how well matched they were as to beauty:" and added &s;he often, "I cannot think both my friends in the grave, while my &s;on lives, and you are in being."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;on &s;he had ju&s;t purcha&s;ed a pair of colours for, as &s;he was deter|mined he &s;hould be like his father in every thing. When the Baron had kept his daughter in his ca&s;tle about &s;ix months, as we have &s;aid before; Ma|dame Franzel thought it high time to &s;ee what the young Cecil thought of it; and, therefore, &s;ent a &s;ervant
<PB N="25" REF="36">
with a note, to inform the Baron, that &s;he &s;hould &s;tay two or three days there, in her way to a place where &s;he was&mdash;not going to. There are certainly &s;uch &s;en&s;ations as pre-&s;entiments: for the arrival of this note, made the Baron walk half a dozen times up and down the room, he knew not why; made Hogre&s;ton &s;igh, three times as loud, and as often, as he u&s;ually did; and made the pretty Cecil think what gown &s;he &s;hould receive Madame Franzel in; or, rather, which of her gowns be|came her be&s;t. We will leave the Baron to an&s;wer the note; Hogre&s;ten to decide why he &s;ighed &s;o loud; and
<PB N="26" REF="37">
Cecil, why &s;he thought about her dre&s;s at all, who never had be&s;towed half a thought on it before.</P>
<P>We will leave them, I &s;ay, for one night, while I employ it in recollect|ing the &s;econd part of this intere&s;ting anecdote; which I prote&s;t, gentle, or ungentle reader, may be a plagiari&s;m as to facts; but as to &s;tile, the care|le&s;s inattention with which I relate, may prove its originality.</P>

<P>CECIL was combing and arranging her beautiful hair, when, at nine o'clock in the morning, her door open|ed, and &s;he found her&s;elf almo&s;t &s;mo|thered with ki&s;&s;es in the arms of Madame Franzel, who with great judg|ment took her by &s;urpri&s;e. And Cecil never felt any confu&s;ion at being caught in her <HI>peignoie,</HI> till, in rai&s;ing her head
<PB N="28" REF="39">
from the fat neck of her friend, &s;he &s;aw behind her a young officer, who&s;e un|common beauty left her no doubt of his name: if I could with a pen draw the picture of joy and health together, I would de&s;cribe young Franzel. But I &s;hall content my&s;elf with &s;aying, that the mother's hilarity, and the father's beauty, joined together in his happy frame, made him an object of love and admiration, to every human being: what then were Cecil's feelings? Cecil, who had never &s;een a young man, much le&s;s a hand&s;ome one: and that one looking into her heart already.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="40">
If my reader cries, <HI>p&s;haw,</HI> or <HI>&s;tuff,</HI> or <HI>non&s;en&s;e;</HI> I pity him: there is &s;uch a thing as love at fir&s;t &s;ight. And if he goes through the whole book with tho&s;e <HI>p&s;haws,</HI> and <HI>&s;tuffs,</HI> and <HI>non&s;en&s;es;</HI> may he never feel it.</P>
<P>Madame Franzel laughed exceed|ingly at Cecil's countenance, and turn|ing about, pre&s;ented her to her &s;on, who then looked down, and felt awed by the pre&s;ence of a beautiful young wo|man, for the fir&s;t time in his life; while Cecil blu&s;hed, and &s;tammered out a few non&s;en&s;ical words. By this time the Baron arrived in Cecil's room, and
<PB N="30" REF="41">
made &s;ome &s;peeches, which were not of the mo&s;t gracious kind; for though he was not a reflecter upon cau&s;es and effects, he thought Madame Franzel came to dun him at lea&s;t: and his pre|&s;entiments made him look at young Franzel with eyes that would have frightened any other young man. The Baron handed Madame Franzel into her apartment, where he left her with her &s;on, whom &s;he ki&s;&s;ed on both cheeks, as was her cu&s;tom when &s;he was more plea&s;ed than u&s;ual. And Cecil, and Cecil, &s;aid &s;he, and Cecil, hey!</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="42">
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, my dear mother,"</Q> cried young Franzel; and Cecil, repeated he three times. By the time they had got into the drawing-room, where a &s;ervant had told them the breakfa&s;t waited their pre&s;ence, the mother and &s;on under|&s;tood one another perfectly: though before that moment Madame Franzel had never mentioned Cecil to him.&mdash;Full of the mo&s;t ro&s;e-coloured thoughts did the&s;e two per&s;ons and Cecil eat their breakfa&s;ts; while the Baron and Hogre&s;ten's countenances di&s;played a contra&s;t to theirs, which amu&s;ed Ma|dame Franzel, who, though no Philo|&s;opher, could read into the &s;oul.</P>

Young Franzel, after the fir&s;t half hour, re&s;umed his natural gaiety; and the fits of laughter which &s;eized him at the redoubled attentions and formal a&s;&s;iduity of Hogre&s;ten to Cecil, di&s;|compo&s;ed the gravity and u&s;ual &s;olem|nity of the whole day. The Baron &s;tared; Hogre&s;ten frowned: but things went on tolerably well, till the Baron, at dinner, a&s;&s;ured Madame Franzel that all tho&s;e pictures were originals: young Franzel &s;aid, he did not doubt but they were <HI>Originals.</HI> The &s;tre&s;s he laid upon this word, and the look he gave to Cecil, who did not let a &s;ylla|ble he uttered e&s;cape her, made his
<PB N="33" REF="44">
mother laugh, Cecil bite her lips, and Hogre&s;ton cry, Hey! The Baron drew up and muttered the word Puppy be|tween his teeth. In the evening, mu|&s;ic &s;oftened all things, and the Baron &s;miled; till Cecil had &s;o often made young Franzel repeat one &s;ong (for he &s;ung) that the Baron thought it high time to call for candles, to go to bed.</P>
<P>Young Franzel had had many Mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, but they were of that kind that flung them&s;elves at his head; therefore, as Cecil's charms kept him awake all night, he lay ruminating how he &s;hould di&s;clo&s;e his pa&s;&s;ion for her: Love is
<PB N="34" REF="45">
fearful; and for the fir&s;t time in his life, he was afraid.</P>
<P>At breakfa&s;t, he told her he would write out the &s;ong &s;he de&s;ired. <Q REND="inline">"I de|&s;ire, &s;aid &s;he, did I de&s;ire?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh! yes;" replied his mother, taking Cecil under the arm, "that &s;ong he &s;ung la&s;t night:"</Q> and drawing her out of the room, &s;he walked with her till it was time to dre&s;s for dinner; when &s;he took her up into her bed|chamber, and de&s;ired her to arrange her hair; which Cecil did with a grace and neatne&s;s peculiar to her&s;elf. Young
<PB N="35" REF="46">
Franzel was writing out, in his mother's anti-room, the &s;ong, and whatever el&s;e he plea&s;ed. When Cecil came to pa&s;s through that room, to go into her own; he had not quite fini&s;hed, he &s;aid, and de&s;ired her to &s;it down; which &s;he did, to wait till he had done. He &s;oon approached her with the paper he had been writing upon, and coming up clo&s;e to her, he dropt down on one knee; &s;he laughing, took the paper, and &s;aw it covered from one end to the other with the&s;e words, <HI>Iris, je vous adore.</HI></P>
<P>She would have remained with her eyes fixt on the paper till doom's-day,
<PB N="36" REF="47">
if young Franzel had not &s;natched it away; and putting one hand round her wai&s;t, with the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned ge&s;|ture, he &s;aid, <HI>Oui, je vous adore.</HI> She &s;tooped to lift him from the ground; but her confu&s;ion was &s;o great, that her head re&s;ted upon his &s;houlder: and how long they might have remained in this attitude, or how &s;hort a time, the god of love alone can tell; if Madam Franzel had not come in. Cecil &s;lung her&s;elf into her arms, to hide her blu&s;hes. Madame Franzel's ideas, as to matrimony, were &s;o truly like her figure, comfortable! that &s;he thought Cecil's inclination of more con&s;equence
<PB N="37" REF="48">
to be con&s;ulted, than the Baron's. <Q REND="inline">"Well, my love, &s;aid &s;he, will you be my daughter?"</Q> Young Franzel, by this time, had got behind his mo|ther, where he had kneeled down, and &s;eized one of Cecil's hands, which he was devouring; when the door of the anti-room opened, and Hogre&s;ten ap|peared, to the no &s;mall &s;urpri&s;e of the happy groupe.</P>
<P>Madame Franzel, turning round, &s;aw him. <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir!" &s;aid &s;he. "Well, Madam!" he replied: but pulling off his hat, he added, "I di&s;turb you, no doubt;"</Q> and then di&s;appeared.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="49">
If it was the art of war, or pre-&s;enti|ment before mentioned, I know not: but certain it is, Hogre&s;ten had &s;ome|thing within him that told him, Madame Franzel meant to take Cecil's heart by &s;urpri&s;e; to prevent which, he had been &s;trolling like a di&s;contented &s;pirit as he was, all the morning, about the ca&s;tle, watching for an opportunity to &s;peak to her: he had &s;een her go into her friend's apartment. His unea&s;i|ne&s;s increa&s;ing by young Franzel going there too, it broke through all his pru|dence, and he bounced into the room, and out of it, as I have de&s;cribed. As &s;oon as he was gone, Madame Franzel
<PB N="39" REF="50">
informed the young people, that &s;he was determined to &s;peak to the Baron about them, before her departure the next day.</P>
<P>That one was pa&s;&s;ed in a manner, which I leave young and happy lovers to gue&s;s. And although the time and circum&s;tances did not permit them to be alone together, the evening's walk, which was prolonged by the mother, gave young Franzel the opportunity of offering his arm to Cecil, who leaned upon it: notwith&s;tanding two terrible eyes as large as &s;aucers, which Hogre|&s;ten rolled at her, in &s;pite of all Madame
<PB N="40" REF="51">
Franzel did to keep his head in its right place; her <HI>Embonpoint</HI> giving her a good excu&s;e to plead the want of the Baron, and Hogre&s;ten's &s;upport on each &s;ide. It was almo&s;t dark when they returned to the ca&s;tle: and it is recorded by a crow, who was perched upon the top of one of the large&s;t trees in the avenue, that young Franzel gave Cecil a ki&s;s behind it. Be that as it would, his looks and her's cau&s;ed &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s to Hogre&s;ten all the re&s;t of the evening, that he was deter|mined not to go to bed at all, but watch Cecil; who, innocent as the new-fledged dove, little dreamed how
<PB N="41" REF="52">
many per&s;ons would &s;it up on her account that night. Young Franzel pa&s;&s;ed the beginning of it in his mother's room, raving to her of Cecil. Hogre&s;ten walked under Cecil's win|dow for &s;ome hours; and, &s;eeing a light through it, he fir&s;t que&s;tioned the old hou&s;ekeeper, what Cecil did when &s;he left her. The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Baron's hou&s;ekeeper was dignified with nearly as many titles, as were contained in her ma&s;ter's Barony. She was called Cook, Steward, Dairy-Maid, and Cecil's Waiting-Woman, by turns.</NOTE>hou&s;ekeeper in|formed him, that Cecil was &s;itting up reading in her bed-gown. Cecil, in

fact, agitated in a manner new to her, was determined to read, as &s;he could not &s;leep. It was a very hot night; and &s;he left windows and doors open. The door, indeed, of her anti-room, which gave into the gallery, was &s;hut.</P>
<P>While Hogre&s;ten was walking in the true Knight-lover &s;tile, with arms acro&s;s, looking up at the light in Cecil's room, young Franzel pa&s;&s;ed through the gallery, to go from his mother's room into his own; but being quite lo&s;t in thought, he mi&s;took his way, and pa&s;&s;ing through Cecil's anti-room
<PB N="43" REF="54">
into her bed-chamber, was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee her &s;itting, with her head re&s;ting on one hand; a book lay open upon the table before her; her eyes, it is true, were fixed upon it, but lo&s;t in thought; one &s;ingle leaf which &s;he had never turned over, &s;erved to repre&s;ent the words, the looks, nay, the very per&s;on of young Franzel. Surpri&s;e deprived her of &s;peech, when &s;he beheld the living object of her thoughts. I have before &s;aid, that Cecil had never &s;een a young man; therefore, be not offended, Prudes, if &s;he did not know, that it was proper to have fainted or &s;hrieked at the ap|proach
<PB N="44" REF="55">
of her lover;&mdash;who impetu|ous naturally, placed the candle he had in his hand on the table, and very &s;oon taught Cecil every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed in his mind, &s;ince the fir&s;t mo|ment he &s;aw her. What &s;igns or fi|gures he made u&s;e of, to convey all his knowledge to her, I know not: certain it is, that the hours appeared to this young couple as moments; while Hogre&s;ten, who through the window &s;aw Cecil's room more illu|mined than before;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sweet maid, &s;aid he, &s;he has an additional light; probably has begun a new chapter:"</Q> little dreaming, what the chapter of
<PB N="45" REF="56">
accidents had brought about. The Baron &s;at up that night, writing an abridgment of his pedigree, to re|duce it into the &s;ize of a &s;mall pocket volume, which he intended that Cecil &s;hould always carry about her, as a charm again&s;t ignoble connections or acquaintances.</P>
<P>Day-light, which was ju&s;t beginning to appear, put an end to the different occupations of the&s;e &s;leeple&s;s per&s;o|nages. The Baron, with difficulty, tore him&s;elf from his beloved an|ce&s;tors; Hogre&s;ten unwillingly quitted his reveries; and young Franzel more
<PB N="46" REF="57">
reluctantly than either, quitted Cecil's chamber, and cro&s;&s;ing the gallery he run again&s;t Hogre&s;ten, who was cro&s;|ing it likewi&s;e, to go into his own room.</P>
<P>Young Franzel's brea&s;t was too full of &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ions to admit of fear; &s;o without &s;topping to di&s;tingui&s;h who, or indeed caring who it was, that he had almo&s;t over&s;et, he arrived in his room. But Hogre&s;ten looked at him, and after him for &s;ome minutes: in|deed, well he might; for had not the rude &s;hock he received from Franzel by running again&s;t him, convinced
<PB N="47" REF="58">
him, that he was not an immaterial being, the young man's di&s;ordered figure, and ha&s;ty &s;teps all together, proved that he was far from being a di&s;&s;atisfied gho&s;t.</P>
<P>One &s;pecies of jealou&s;y is enough to torture a man; therefore, one cannot be &s;urpri&s;ed that Hogre&s;ten, who&s;e brea&s;t was torn by many, pa&s;&s;ed all the re&s;t of the morning revolv|ing in his mind what he &s;hould do; he had not at &s;even o'clock decided, if he &s;hould let the Ba|ron or Cecil fir&s;t know his &s;u&s;pici|ons and wi&s;hes; nor cea&s;ed &s;triding
<PB N="48" REF="59">
up and down the fatal gallery, im|ploring with his eyes all the ance&s;tors around: when the Baron, who in|tended to lay his commands upon Ce|cil, as to her mode of parting with her company, appeared; he, with only a nod of approbation &s;aluted Hogre&s;ten, whom he was very well plea&s;ed to find as he thought, examining the much loved faces of his forefathers; little dreamed he, that his cou&s;in's mind ran not on ance&s;tors, but de&s;cendants. We have already &s;aid, the Baron was no great ob&s;erver; therefore, it is no wonder that he did not take notice, that there was &s;omething more than
<PB N="49" REF="60">
u&s;ual in his cou&s;in's countenance, and &s;omething le&s;s in his daughter's. That morning Cecil's fine eyes were not open when her father came into her room; he &s;eated him&s;elf by her bed|&s;ide, and began a long harangue upon the di&s;tance &s;he ought to keep certain ranks of people at. Could the Baron have read her tell-tale countenance, he might have &s;een, that fear was her fir&s;t &s;en&s;ation; and that all her looks after that was pa&s;t, &s;aid <HI>Moutarde apres diner,</HI> whenever he mentioned the word di&s;tance. We will leave him to fini&s;h his ill-timed &s;ermon, and take Madame Franzel out of bed, who had
<PB N="50" REF="61">
&s;lept all night, as is cu&s;tomary to tho&s;e who are well covered by nature: &s;he was &s;ome time before &s;he came out of her apartment, as &s;he had to arrange a much more difficult thing than her clothes before her departure; for well &s;he knew the Baron's family pride. And though her &s;on could boa&s;t of a grandfather, that grandfather was a farmer-general; and any thing that &s;avored of finance, &s;he knew the Ba|ron would object to. But &s;he &s;um|moned up all her courage, and invo|king the gentle &s;pirits of her departed friends, and giving their faces both a ki&s;s a piece as &s;he fa&s;tened her brace|lets,
<PB N="51" REF="62">
&s;he &s;allied forth to breakfa&s;t, where &s;he found Hogre&s;ten, who&s;e undecided countenance &s;till remained: &s;he, with her more than u&s;ual &s;miles, a&s;ked him, <Q REND="inline">"If he did not think Cecil and her &s;on very well &s;uited to each other:"</Q> he was confounded at what he thought her impudence, and an|&s;wered very gravely, that <Q REND="inline">"The Ba|ron was the be&s;t judge:" "Not at all," replied Madame Franzel, "parents are partial judges: but, I hope, the whole world will &s;ee how perfectly they are matched.

<PB N="52" REF="63">
went on with her good-humoured re|flections, the more a&s;toni&s;hed Ho|gre&s;ten was; for almo&s;t every thing &s;he &s;aid, appeared to him as a double entendre, as he &s;u&s;pected that her &s;on had pa&s;&s;ed the night in Cecil's room, and imagined he was &s;ure of it. He then thought &s;he intended to encou|rage a <HI>tendre</HI> in him for her&s;elf; and the rectitude of honor prompted him to confe&s;s, that his heart was pre-engaged. Ten thou&s;and romantic no|tions crowded upon his mind; and he was preparing to make her a long &s;peech, while &s;he was waiting for his an&s;wers. I would hold up, had I time,
<PB N="53" REF="64">
Hogre&s;ten's indignation, as a good le&s;&s;on for all my friends, to teach them not to fly too much from &s;ociety: for imagination in &s;olitude, becomes a magnifying gla&s;s, and repre&s;ents com|mon occurrences in &s;uch a light, that a per&s;on who has lived in &s;ociety, con|ver&s;ing with one who has a&s;&s;ociated only with books, appears as a com|po&s;ition of levity and incon&s;equence. Poor Madame Franzel little thought that Hogre&s;ten was &s;hocked by what he thought the indecency of her con|ver&s;ation: &s;he was indeed &s;urpri&s;ed at his looks, and meant to have a&s;ked the meaning of them, and his &s;ilence;
<PB N="54" REF="65">
but her &s;on's flying into the room, with more than his u&s;ual &s;pirits, put an end to the <HI>Tete a Tete;</HI> he had not been long there before the Baron came, and &s;oon after Cecil, who turned pale as &s;he &s;at down.</P>
<P>At hearing Madame Franzel's coach drive up to the door, I leave to tho&s;e who love to recollect their fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, to imagine what Cecil felt who had been &s;urpri&s;ed into her's, and had ex|perienced all its mo&s;t plea&s;ing effects; and knew from her father's di&s;cour&s;e, that in all probability, when that coach went away from his door, every thing
<PB N="55" REF="66">
dear and delightful would be conveyed away in it, perhaps never to be within her reach again. I leave all her pain|ful ideas to be imagined, and &s;hall only &s;ay, &s;he never dared look young Franzel in the face during the whole breakfa&s;t: her father thought it through obedience; Madame Franzel thought it mode&s;ty; her &s;on was &s;ure of it, and &s;o am I too.</P>
<P>Madame Franzel &s;hortened the breakfa&s;t as much as po&s;&s;ible, to the no &s;mall &s;atisfaction of all parties: the Baron longed to &s;ee his company depart; Madame Franzel to &s;peak in
<PB N="56" REF="67">
private to him; her &s;on to his mi&s;tre&s;s: and the various wi&s;hes and fears of the whole party, made the breakfa&s;t as &s;tu|pid as po&s;&s;ible. Madame Franzel begged to pa&s;s into another room with the Baron; and Franzel and Cecil walked up to the window together, where we will leave them looking a language, which eyes alone can &s;peak; and fol|low the Baron, who expecting to be a&s;ked for money, drew a chair civily towards Madame Franzel, and de&s;ired her to be &s;eated, as is the cu&s;tom, I am told, for a debtor to his creditor. She with a carele&s;s ea&s;e peculiar to her&s;elf, propo&s;ed the union between the two
<PB N="57" REF="68">
young people. Provoked at her man|ner, as much as at her propo&s;al, the Baron &s;aid ha&s;tily, <Q REND="inline">"Mention it no more, Madame, the thing is impo&s;&s;i|ble."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Impo&s;&s;ible, Sir! what rea&s;ons can you have to allege?"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Rea&s;ons! rea&s;ons! (repeated the Baron, loud enough to be heard in the adjoining room) rea&s;ons, I have five hundred at lea&s;t." "Five hundred, Sir!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Madame; and lea&s;t you doubt them, I will &s;hew you a few of them."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="69">
Now, if I had the pencil of Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, with his method of u&s;ing it, I would draw the figure of the Baron, who with a bitter &s;mile upon his countenance moved a few paces back, and drew him&s;elf up in an exact po&s;ture; and with his left hand &s;tuck upon his hip, di&s;played his right hand, waving it round, pointing to the pictures of his ance&s;tors. After a long pau&s;e, which only made Ma|dame Franzel &s;tare at him: <Q REND="inline">"There, there, Madame!"&mdash;"Are the&s;e your rea&s;ons, Sir?" &s;aid &s;he. "Yes, Ma|dame," he replied, enraged at her placid &s;mile: "Yes, Madame, and
<PB N="59" REF="70">
heaven forbid my daughter &s;hould make my ance&s;tors blu&s;h by her di&s;|gracing them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I dare &s;ay, Sir," &s;aid Madame Franzel, who&s;e &s;en&s;e by this time told her there were no hopes, "I dare &s;ay tho&s;e gentlemen and ladies would not be &s;orry that their grand-daughter &s;hould be able to wa&s;h their faces with &s;ome of a farmer-general's &s;oap: however, I take my leave of them," &s;aid &s;he, curt&s;ying all round. "Come, Baron," added &s;he, recollecting her|&s;elf, "let us &s;till be friends, time may alter your way of thinking." "Oh!
<PB N="60" REF="71">
never, never, Madame," &s;aid he, &s;ha|king with anger the hand he had taken; "I wi&s;h you a good journey, hope you will have fine weather, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c."</Q> With like compliments they walked up to the young people, who had, I &s;uppo&s;e, agreed better in their con|ver&s;ation; Madame Franzel ki&s;&s;ed Cecil, who returned her ki&s;&s;es with a truly filial &s;orrow; and, who kept her eyes fixed on the coach, till &s;he could &s;ee it no more; nor dared &s;he take a parting look at young Franzel, lea&s;t the tears that &s;tood trembling on her eyelids, &s;hould force their way down her cheeks.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="72">
When they were gone, and many hours were pa&s;&s;ed, Cecil experienced a &s;urpri&s;e unknown to her before; &s;he fell giddy with the rapidity, with which love, its con&s;equences, and the lo&s;s of her univer&s;e, had followed each other.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tly may I &s;ay her univer&s;e, yes, her &s;oul; for young Franzel employed every corner of her heart; and this idea was become the principle of her exi&s;tence. Therefore, when upon re|collection &s;he was &s;ure he was gone, a horrible &s;tilne&s;s &s;eemed to reign around, and &s;he became nearly as
<PB N="62" REF="73">
inanimate as one of the canvas an|ce&s;tors! It was not till after &s;upper was over, that &s;he was rouzed from this &s;ituation, by her father's a&s;king her and Hogre&s;ten to gue&s;s, if po&s;&s;i|ble, what propo&s;al Madame Franzel had made to him before her depar|ture: they both an&s;wered, they could not tell, though they both more than doubted of what was coming. The Baron enlarged, and expatiated upon the in&s;olence of &s;uch a propo&s;al, while Cecil blu&s;hed and &s;ighed by turns.</P>
<P>Two days after, Madame Franzel wrote to Cecil, who unfortunately re|ceived
<PB N="63" REF="74">
the letter at dinner; not that Madame Franzel meant that her letter &s;hould have been a my&s;tery; but her &s;on had inclo&s;ed in it a note, which the Baron perceived, and in&s;i&s;ted on reading together with the letter. The note was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<PB N="64" REF="75">
<P>P.S. Con&s;ult my mother, &s;he is our be&s;t friend: command, and I obey.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I have already &s;aid that young Fran|zel's character was impetuous, &s;incere, and open too: he could form no &s;cheme, but he looked upon Cecil as his wife; and if his fir&s;t letter was la|conic, at lea&s;t it was to the purpo&s;e. The Baron's rage was not to be de|&s;cribed. The heavenly ties, made him imagine, they were married pri|vately.&mdash;Where! how! by whom! where! the&s;e were the only words he uttered for &s;ome time; while Cecil
<PB N="65" REF="76">
&s;at petrified with fear. And Hogre&s;|ten then thought it a lucky moment to ingratiate him&s;elf into her favor. <Q REND="inline">"Retire, fair creature!" &s;aid he, rai|&s;ing her from her feat; "retire into your chamber, while I unravel this my&s;tery."</Q> She hurried away, but wondered how he could unravel it.</P>
<P>Hogre&s;ten doubted now no more that his &s;u&s;picions were true; and he pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal hours with the Baron, &s;ighing, lamenting, execrating his &s;tars, that he but too well knew the mean|ing of the ties young Franzel menti|oned. <Q REND="inline">"And dear Sir, added he,
<PB N="66" REF="77">
artfully, &s;o much have I the honor of my family at heart, that I am ready to take her, and&mdash;."</Q> Here the Ba|ron, who &s;till thought &s;he was married to young Franzel, made him enter into a detail of that fatal night. And &s;trange to tell, his family pride was a little comforted, by finding that the <HI>ties</HI> which had alarmed him &s;o much, were not &s;acred, though heavenly: and he thought young Franzel's wearing his daughter's favors, did not &s;ignify, &s;o as &s;he did not wear his name.</P>
<P>He embraced his generous cou&s;in who would marry his daughter; and,
<PB N="67" REF="78">
I believe, they were the only two men exi&s;ting, who were glad that their young female relation &s;hould not be married to a man who had pa&s;&s;ed the night in her room.</P>
<P>Hogre&s;ten &s;ent the old hou&s;e-keeper the next day, to a&s;k an audience of Cecil. He took uncommon pains at his toilet; his nine hairs of a &s;ide were curled, nay, they were powdered too; he put on a pair of &s;ilk &s;tockings, on two legs that had no calves to them; and a &s;mile upon a face that had no dimples or cheeks to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="79">
Alas! poor man, he little dreamed that his &s;tars were as cro&s;s-grained in love, as in war! by the rules of which, or tho&s;e of chivalry, he car|ried on all his operations: therefore, to frighten Cecil fir&s;t, and then make his own terms, he, without he&s;itation, told her that her father knew, that young Franzel had pa&s;&s;ed the night in her room. A moment's reflection con|vinced her that was not true; love in|&s;pired her with courage, and brought back her u&s;ual flow of &s;pirits: &s;he therefore, ironically, only &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, indeed, upon my word;"</Q> and like in|terjections, as he pau&s;ed now and then:

for though he had made a &s;peech, her looks, which were arch and malicious, deranged it very much. He ended all he had to &s;ay, by flinging him&s;elf pro&s;trate at her feet; &s;he aro&s;e, and tripping as light as air to the door, which &s;he held open, &s;he looked back and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am exceedingly obliged to you, for telling me that you will protect my honor, which in the &s;ame breath you inform me I have lo&s;t; but, I have lent it for a little time, to the only per&s;on I &s;hall ever tru&s;t it with: &s;o adieu, generous cou&s;in."</Q></P>

Her father had li&s;tened at the door to all their conver&s;ation; and her la&s;t words exa&s;perated him &s;o highly, that he led her by the hand into an adjoin|ing room, which he told her &s;hould be her pri&s;on till &s;he con&s;ented to be Madame Hogre&s;ten.</P>
<P>This was a large room that had only two windows, which were &s;o near the ceiling, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any one to reach them, even by getting upon the chairs or tables: Cecil, hear|ing her father turn the key, &s;ighed heavily upon looking up at the&s;e win|dows, and in heart reproached all the
<PB N="71" REF="82">
ance&s;tors which, as u&s;ual, covered the whole &s;ides of the room; <Q REND="inline">"Horrid wretches, &s;aid &s;he, it is for your &s;akes, I am thus treated."</Q> The next day being Sunday, the curate dined at the ca&s;tle, to whom the Baron complained of his daughter's ob&s;tinacy: the cu|rate &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He thought piety might work a proper effect;"</Q> the Baron de|&s;ired him to try. When Cecil &s;aw him, &s;he very cleverly thought of a &s;tratagem to make him her friend; &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, &s;he was married to young Franzel; and that, if he would pre|vent murder, he would convey a let|ter to him, and not di&s;clo&s;e the mar|riage to her father.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="83">
The curate thinking that no part of Scripture &s;hould be unfulfilled (and I beg my reader will ju&s;t look over that part of it relative to matrimony, as I have not time to tran&s;cribe it) conveyed the letter to young Franzel, who, in his u&s;ual impetuous way, an|&s;wered, that he &s;hould, after &s;uch a night (naming it) pa&s;s every &s;ucceeding one in waiting round the ca&s;tle, or under the windows of the room &s;he was locked up in, and receive her in his arms, <Q REND="inline">"the only place," added he in his letter, "where you can be &s;afe from per&s;ecution."</Q> That is very true, thought the young Cecil, as &s;he read
<PB N="73" REF="84">
tho&s;e words: but how to get there, is the dilemma. She begged to &s;peak with the curate, whom &s;he de&s;ired to &s;hew young Franzel, who was on the out&s;ide of the ca&s;tle, the two unfortu|nate windows, <Q REND="inline">"which, &s;aid &s;he, my good father, I &s;ee no po&s;&s;ibility of reaching: if once I could get at them, the ter|race on the out&s;ide comes up &s;o high, that I could jump down without hurting my&s;elf."</Q> The curate with a true cleri|cal prudence a&s;&s;ured her, that, though he would &s;hew her hu&s;band the windows from the out&s;ide, he could by no means aid or a&s;&s;i&s;t her reaching them

on the in&s;ide; his con&s;cience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This German curate had probably the &s;ame kind of con&s;cience that the Paris &s;hop|keepers have,&mdash;applied to every thing, and &s;tretching to fit every thing.</NOTE> not per|mitting him to incur the Baron's anger. Cecil again, before he quitted her, made him promi&s;e to execute that part of his commi&s;&s;ion that would not of|fend his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>When every thing was &s;till in the hou&s;e, &s;he tried to heap the chairs upon the table, the bed-clothes upon them; but all would not do to reach half way up this horrid room, which
<PB N="75" REF="86">
was &s;o high, that &s;he de&s;paired ever getting up to the windows. She went to bed at la&s;t, and wept her&s;elf to &s;leep: &s;he dreamed of her lover, and that all the pictures in the room fell down: &s;he waked thinking of them; and draw|ing a&s;ide her curtains, &s;he looked ear|ne&s;tly at them for &s;ome time. At la&s;t, with much ruminating and reflection, &s;till looking by turns at the windows and the pictures, a thought &s;truck her: &s;he aro&s;e, &s;ent for the Baron, and told him, that &s;he could not bear to &s;ee her honored parents &s;o neglected: <Q REND="inline">"Ob|&s;erve, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, how the du&s;t hides the re&s;pectable faces of tho&s;e that hang

uppermo&s;t: might I be permitted a lad|der to take them down, and have a little &s;oap and water to clean them with?"</Q> If it was the word Soap that was di&s;agreeable to the Baron's ear, or that it brought to his mind Madame Franzel; Madame Franzel, her &s;on; and her &s;on, the ladder; I know not: but he he&s;itated &s;ome time, and then con&s;ented. He brought the ladder him&s;elf in; he mounted it, and took down above fifty parents armed and not armed, of all ages and titles; and as he took them down, he ranged them according to their de&s;cent upon the floor again&s;t the wall, all round the
<PB N="77" REF="88">
room. Delightful occupation! He grew an inch taller at every great action he recited: for he told the hi&s;tory of each of their lives &s;eparately to Cecil, who li&s;tened with compla|cency: only the Baron ob&s;erved, that her eyes were turned often towards the windows, which, as there was no view out of them, made him &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect &s;he had the ladder in view too. The evening &s;urpri&s;ed them in their occupations. Hogre&s;ten came to par|take of the amu&s;ement, and inform the Baron, that dinner had waited a long time. The Baron, after having ordered the ladder out of the room,
<PB N="78" REF="89">
quitted it, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall return to &s;ee the progre&s;s of your work, Cecil: and may your occupation remind you of your exalted birth: and may the&s;e re&s;pectable per&s;onages teach you your duty." "I intend they &s;hall be my aid and &s;upport in future, indeed," re|plied &s;he.</Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Baron was gone, Ce|cil, &s;till locked in, wa&s;hed &s;everal more of her ance&s;tors faces, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! cried &s;he every now and then, Grim Gentry, who have been the cau&s;e of &s;o many a tear; you &s;hall once in my life, make up to me for all the &s;orrow you have occa&s;ioned."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="90">
Soon after dinner, the Baron re|turned with the ladder, which he took great care to have conveyed out at night again; though on purpo&s;e to confirm his &s;u&s;picions, &s;he de&s;ired it might remain.</P>
<P>She could not refu&s;e her&s;elf the ma|licious plea&s;ure that evening, of en|couraging Hogre&s;ten's awkward ad|dre&s;&s;es; &s;he promi&s;ed her father to marry him. She was all gaiety, though every now and then, the Baron &s;u&s;|pected a little, and Hogre&s;ten much more, that &s;he was diverting her&s;elf at the expence of all her relations,
<PB N="80" REF="91">
both dead and living: at la&s;t, night came; &s;he permitted Hogre&s;ten to ki&s;s her hand, and &s;aid, as her father went out, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;he was not at all afraid of &s;leeping in &s;o large a room, with &s;o much good company,"</Q> pointing to the pictures: locked in, &s;he waited till &s;he thought every one a&s;leep; then flew to her honored ance&s;tors, and without regard to precedency, or decency, &s;he heaped grand-fathers on grand|mothers; knights on old maiden aunts; he cou&s;ins bearing armour on &s;he cou|&s;ins bearing di&s;taffs. In her hurry, in|deed, now and then, &s;he &s;ubverted the order of things; &s;he made by turns,
<PB N="81" REF="92">
the ladies &s;upport the gentlemen, and the gentlemen the ladies; here a fa|ther's head re&s;ted on a daughter's feet; there a mother's face met a &s;on's bu&s;kins; &s;harp-pointed &s;lippers rubbed again&s;t flowing perukes; coifs and pinners were joined to long necked &s;purs.&mdash;In &s;hort, heads and tails were jumbled together, and parts never in|tended by nature or good manners to meet, ki&s;&s;ed each other. Thus, one by one, the noble family, as fa&s;t as &s;he could heap them upon each other, made a pile which reached to the win|dows: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Adieu Me&s;&s;ieurs et Me&s;dames,</HI>'</Q> &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he &s;prung out of the win|dow
<PB N="82" REF="93">
into her hand&s;ome Frederic's arms; where we will leave her. Can we di&s;po&s;e of her better?</P>
<P>In the morning, the Baron came into the fatal room, where he &s;aw by the pile of canvas, and the mark of Cecil's &s;mall heel, that had pierced through the once bright eye of a Ger|man aunt and counte&s;s.&mdash;He &s;aw, I &s;ay, that Cecil's ance&s;tors had in|deed been, as &s;he promi&s;ed, her aid. Rage took from him the power of &s;peech for &s;ome hours; but a little time, made him return to all the daily
<PB N="83" REF="94">
occupations which had di&s;tingui&s;hed the Baron before.</P>
<P>Hogre&s;ten returned to his books, to find out &s;ome knight-errant more un|unfortunate than him&s;elf. And we need not add, that Madame Franzel was happy, and made happy her chil|dren, who always &s;poke of their an|ce&s;tors with the gratitude due to them.</P>
<P>May all tho&s;e who approve of the pictures I have drawn, receive as much &s;atisfaction from tho&s;e of their family, as did the fair Cecil from her's. The much loved Franzel's conduct making
<PB N="84" REF="95">
her thank heaven, that &s;he de&s;cended from &s;uch an illu&s;trious and nume|rous race of Kinkvervankot&s;dar&s;pra|kengotchderns.</P>
