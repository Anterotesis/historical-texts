<HEAD>To the Gentlemen, Clergy, and other Voters of the Town of Pre&s;ton.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE re&s;pon&s;ibility for political conduct, and perhaps for all conduct, which every Repre&s;entative owes in a certain degree to the nation at large, and particularly owes to his immediate Con&s;tituents, becomes a more forci|ble duty upon me from the many private friend|&s;hips with which I am honoured among you.</P>
<P>The cri&s;is in which I write is another rea&s;on for this addre&s;s. Never, &s;urely, was there a time in which it was &s;o important for Con&s;ti|tuent and Repre&s;entative to under&s;tand each other; nor ever was there one when more &s;y&s;tematic pains were taken to &s;et them at va|riance.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t purpo&s;e is to explain to you the cau&s;es which have induced me to withdraw my&s;elf from a &s;tation, in which (till it is known that my offers of &s;ervice were rejected) I might be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of &s;erving my country in her extremity with &s;ome effect. The&s;e cau&s;es &s;hall be &s;tated faithfully. It is the intere&s;t and pride of the innocent and in|jured to be ingenuous.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">
For the better under&s;tanding my ca&s;e, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to take a &s;hort retro&s;pect of &s;ome of the leading principles and &s;ituations by which I have been governed.</P>
<P>I had been a member of the Hou&s;e of Commons nearly an entire Parliament be|fore I became a candidate for Pre&s;ton. The te&s;timony of my conduct during that time, of which I was mo&s;t proud, was the approba|tion of Lord Strange, under who&s;e au&s;picies I fir&s;t offered my&s;elf to your favour. It was my happine&s;s to be his relation; but it was my highe&s;t honour that he was my friend by choice. You knew him well&mdash;His natural affections were &s;trong; but his public virtues were inflexible; and no family connection or intere&s;t, unaccompanied with opinion, could have influenced his recommendation for a tru&s;t from the people.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem upon which I had acted the preceding Parliament, and upon which I con|tinued to act in the &s;eat your favour gave me, was &s;hort and plain;&mdash;a con&s;titutional &s;upport of the Crown&mdash;a liberal reliance on tho&s;e who then conducted the public mea&s;ures&mdash;but an independent claim to free opinion and free con|duct upon every occa&s;ion in which my judg|ment called upon me to depart from my gene|al line.</P>
<P>Government gave me countenance and gave me favours; but never at the expence of tho&s;e principles: and I reflect with plea&s;ure and
<PB N="3" REF="4">
gratitude on the &s;anction you have given, Gentlemen, to this a&s;&s;ertion, by having, after tho&s;e favours from the Crown, elected me with uncommon marks of your approbation.</P>
<P>Conformable to the principles I have &s;tated, notwith&s;tanding my general &s;upport of admi|ni&s;tration, I had found my&s;elf obliged &s;ome|times to oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures of the Court; particularly in the debates upon the Conven|tion relative to Falkland's I&s;land; upon the proceedings relative to the Caribbees; and up|on the perpetuity of Mr. Grenville's bill. In the motion I made for the committee of en|quiry into the &s;tate of the India Company, and through the whole progre&s;s of that long bu&s;ine&s;s, I acted without the participation of the Mini&s;ters; and &s;uch accidents of &s;epara|tion had ari&s;en between Lord North (the &s;up|po&s;ed leading Mini&s;ter) and me, that, although I bore re&s;pect to his character, no two per&s;ons, not in direct enmity, could live at a greater di&s;tance. Such was my political &s;ituation when I was called to the American &s;ervice in the year 1775.</P>
<P>It is known to tho&s;e who employed me, and I have often declared it in public, that I was involuntarily called to it. I was not with|out profe&s;&s;ional rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing to decline it; but I had many others, ari&s;ing from &s;uch per&s;onal circum&s;tances as mo&s;t naturally and &s;trongly affect the human mind&mdash;They are not unknown to you.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
I &s;tated the&s;e &s;entiments when the King's intention of employing me was communica|ted, adding, that powerful as they were, they &s;hould be made &s;ub&s;ervient to the principles I had ever held of a &s;oldier's duty; and if his Maje&s;ty thought me, then the la&s;t and humble&s;t upon the li&s;t of his major-generals, to be nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, I &s;hould forego any idea of excu&s;ing my&s;elf upon the plea of my private circum&s;tances. I was a&s;&s;ured, in terms very honourable to me, that his Maje&s;ty was decided in his choice of generals, and I immediately declared my rea|dine&s;s to obey.</P>
<P>Thus engaged, I re&s;olved to dedicate my|&s;elf to my new &s;ituation. I &s;aw the national objects to which it opened. I had uniformly &s;upported the principle then held out by the Mini&s;ters&mdash;the &s;upremacy of the King in Parliament; and from truly public &s;en&s;ations, I endeavoured to put my&s;elf upon as good terms as po&s;&s;ible with the Fir&s;t Lord of the Trea&s;ury. I &s;ugge&s;ted a command at New-York with four regiments (it was the very beginning of the troubles) with a view to ne|gotiation, not to arms. The idea &s;eemed to be much approved; but I am not ma&s;ter of the &s;ecret and political circum&s;tances that pre|vented its being adopted. I am now inclined to believe that had the mea&s;ure taken place, the war would have been prevented; or at lea&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="6">
it would have begun with that important place being in the King's government.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing campaign (if the blockade of Bo&s;ton can be called by that name) my efforts to be of u&s;e in the public &s;ervice were not confined to the immediate line of my &s;tation, but were exerted at large, and received very flattering te&s;timonies of appro|bation at home and abroad.</P>
<P>Late in the winter of 1775 I returned to England. The King's Mini&s;ters &s;aw and ac|knowledged, that in the rea&s;ons for that re|turn, my zeal for the public &s;ervice kept pace with the anxieties of my private &s;ituation. It entirely prevailed over them, when very early in the &s;pring I was called upon for &s;ervice in Canada. It may be &s;uppo&s;ed that I &s;olicited that de&s;tination (as by &s;ome it was &s;uppo&s;ed that I had &s;olicited the former one). The contrary was &s;o true, that I would have pur|cha&s;ed a redemption from the &s;ervice, would my principle of public honour have permitted, with the la&s;t &s;hilling of my military income. At the time I embarked, acute di&s;temper was added to pain of mind, ari&s;ing from the family di&s;tre&s;s I before alluded to, and the circum&s;tan|ces requiring my continuance in England were become much more affecting than the year before.</P>
<P>My endeavours in the campaign under Sir Guy Carleton, in 1776, were al&s;o thought worthy commendation; and before my re|turn
<PB N="6" REF="7">
I was pitched upon for the command of the troops de&s;tined to make a junction with Sir William Howe from Canada.</P>
<P>I had now &s;u&s;tained the &s;evere private mi&s;|fortune which I had &s;o long dreaded. Em|ployment in the field was the be&s;t relief that could be offered to affliction; and for the fir&s;t time &s;ince the war I was earne&s;t to go to America.</P>
<P>I have &s;lightly touched this progre&s;s of my late &s;ervice, to &s;hew that the &s;ituation in which I was placed in the year 1777, was not one of private favour, court intrigue, or per&s;onal ambition, but naturally devolving to me from occurrences and from general opinion. Whe|ther that opinion was ju&s;tly founded, this is not the place to di&s;cu&s;s. An account of the campaign, in the part where I commanded, will forth with be &s;ubmitted to the public in a detail of the facts proved before Parliament, and in other authentic documents. In the mean time let me be permitted to &s;ay, that however freely cavillers and &s;peculati&s;ts may have treated my military conduct, none have di&s;puted the prin|ciple and zeal which actuated my endeavours.</P>
<P>With tho&s;e claims, Gentlemen, to the coun|tenance and good-will at lea&s;t of government, I proceed to relate the treatment I received.</P>
<P>I had expre&s;&s;ed, in my private letter from Albany to the Secretary of State, my <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"con|fidence in the ju&s;tice of the King and his Councils to &s;upport the General they had
<PB N="7" REF="8">
thought proper to appoint to as arduous an undertaking and under as po&s;itive a direc|tion as a cabinet ever framed."</Q> I had in the &s;ame letter given an opinion of the enemy's troops, upon near in&s;pection of their numbers, appointment and di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>Furni&s;hed with the&s;e materials, and &s;up|ported by the fidelity with which I had acted, it was not thought expedient I &s;hould have acce&s;s to the King. What other facts might have been cleared up by my interview, and were wi&s;hed not to be cleared up, the Secre|tary of State<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whenever <HI>the Secretary of State</HI> is mentioned in the&s;e papers, the per&s;on to be under&s;tood is the Secretary for the American department, Lord George Germain.</NOTE> only can inform the world. Di|rect means of effecting my exclu&s;ion from the King's pre&s;ence were not practicable; for the ca&s;e was unprecedented. The pretext adopted was as follows.</P>
<P>It was &s;ugge&s;ted that an enquiry &s;hould be made by a board of General Officers into the cau&s;es of the mi&s;carriage of the Northern Ex|pedition; and a court <HI>etiquette</HI> was invented, the foundation of which in rea&s;on or pre|cedent I am not acquainted with, <HI>viz.</HI> that the per&s;ons who&s;e conduct was &s;o put in que&s;tion, &s;hould not appear at Court pending the enquiry. No difficulty of the competency of &s;uch a court was then &s;poke of, or perhaps
<PB N="8" REF="9">
thought of, by any but the dark de&s;igners of my ruin; the mea&s;ure therefore could neither affect his Maje&s;ty nor his Court with any idea of farther hard&s;hip than the delay of a few days to my appearing in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>This arrangement had been prepared by the Secretary of State, in the interval between the notice of my arrival at Port&s;mouth, which he received in the evening, and my vi&s;it to him in Pall-Mall, which was before noon the next day.</P>
<P>It will naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;tate in which I &s;tood was the fir&s;t &s;ubject of conver&s;a|tion; on the contrary, I was received with much apparent kindne&s;s; explanations pa&s;&s;ed, but they were friendly; I was heard attentive|ly, through a report of all the tran&s;actions &s;ub|&s;equent to the Convention of Saratoga, and I was led by degrees, and without &s;u&s;picion of in&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s, to the mo&s;t confidential com|munication, on my part, of facts, ob&s;ervations, and opinions, re&s;pecting very important ob|jects.</P>
<P>If the mea&s;ure of denying me acce&s;s to the King had been undecided before, this conver|&s;ation was of a nature to produce a deci&s;ion; for it opened truths re&s;pecting the di&s;po&s;itions of the people of America, and the &s;tate of things there, very different from the ideas which (it is now known, from the line taken by the Se|cretary of State in the late enquiry) were pre|valent in the governing Councils of this king|dom.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">
It was not 'till after the matter of my com|munication was exhau&s;ted, that the Secretary of State drew from his pocket an order, that I &s;hould prepare my&s;elf for an enquiry: at which I expre&s;&s;ed my fulle&s;t &s;atisfaction, till he follow|ed the order with the information of the <HI>eti|quette</HI> I before mentioned, that I was not to ap|pear at Court.</P>
<P>Having pitched upon this expedient for no other end than to exclude me from the pre&s;ence of my Sovereign, he could hardly be in pain about the event. If the General Officers ap|pointed for a Board of Enquiry, &s;hould co|incide with the notion that my parole was of &s;uch a nature as to bar their proceedings, this would put off my acce&s;s to the King to a very long day: but if the General Officers &s;hould not enter into the&s;e ideas, be had a re&s;ource left. He could not be unapprized, that &s;uch a court was held by high authorities in the law to be illegal; and if I was not to &s;ee the King until an illegal or que&s;tionable court &s;hould make a valid report, I was never likely to en|joy that honour. Either way I was not to have the benefit of an Enquiry; but he was to have the advantage of the <HI>pretence</HI> of one, in order to &s;hut the door of St. James's again&s;t me. This has been made apparent beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, by every part of his &s;ub|&s;equent conduct: but at that time, though I &s;aw a di&s;grace was intended me, I was not able to e&s;timate the full extent of it.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">
Thus prevented in my intended appeal to the King, and as I have fatal rea&s;on to believe, the King's ear &s;ecured again&s;t me, attempts were not unthought of to deprive me of a voice in Parliament. A great Law Officer of the Crown, made, <HI>in the form of</HI> legal doubts, a long and methodical argument again&s;t my compe|tence to any civil duty or function: but it was not found &s;o ea&s;y to exclude me from your &s;ervice, as it had been to deprive me of counte|nance at Court; and mini&s;ters only &s;hewed by that abortive attempt, what their motives were, in tho&s;e attempts in which they had been more &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Though the late time of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and the ab&s;ence of Sir William Howe and Sir Guy Carleton, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be parties, furni&s;hed plau&s;ible arguments for po&s;tponing a Parliamentary Enquiry in the &s;ummer of 1778, it was evident the temper of the Hou&s;e of Commons was inclined to adopt it at the en|&s;uing meeting.</P>
<P>In the beginning of June, I received the con|ditional order annexed. [<HI>App. No.</HI> 1.] Tho' it bears the King's name, it was avowedly a Let|ter of the Cabinet; and there remained no longer a doubt in my mind, that my ruin was made a mea&s;ure of &s;tate. Few adepts in the &s;cience of oppre&s;&s;ion could have formed a de&s;ign bet|ter fitted to its end; and it was likely to be &s;ucce&s;sful, whatever part I &s;hould take. If I went&mdash;my character was lo&s;t irretrievably&mdash;the fal&s;ehoods and a&s;per&s;ions that have &s;ince been
<PB N="11" REF="12">
refuted in the face of tho&s;e who propagated them, were already gone forth: the numbers of my army, and of that oppo&s;ed to me, were already gro&s;sly mi&s;tated; contradictory char|ges of &s;loth and precipitancy, as the temper of men at the moment &s;eemed inclined to either, were &s;upported with uniform per&s;everance:&mdash;my friends were &s;tated to be my accu&s;ers; and even my integrity, with regard to pecuniary tru&s;ts, was glanced at.</P>
<P>If I &s;tayed, the King's order (as it was fal|laciou&s;ly called) was a &s;pecious topick; and it was not difficult to fore&s;ee, that it would be put into the hands of gentlemen that well knew how to make the utmo&s;t of it by art and opportunity. My an&s;wer [<HI>App. No.</HI> 2.] drew from the cabinet their &s;econd letter [<HI>App. No.</HI> 3.] and I give them the &s;atisfaction of knowing, that I felt all they could wi&s;h I &s;hould feel from the repetition of their &s;everi|ty. I &s;aw in it at once a doubt of my veracity re&s;pecting my health, and the mo&s;t contemp|tuous di&s;regard of all other principles upon which I had claimed a right of &s;taying in this country.&mdash;Fundamental principles, I thought them, of ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity due from all governments to tho&s;e who &s;erve them zea|lou&s;ly, and in &s;ome governments held doubly due to &s;uch as in their zeal have been unfor|tunate.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the mini&s;try kept a profound &s;ilence, both to my&s;elf and the pu|blic, re&s;pecting the ratification of the conven|tion.
<PB N="12" REF="13">
The &s;ame &s;ilence they maintained even in Parliament long after its meeting. They were perfectly appri&s;ed, that the enemy had &s;ome time before made the want of that rati|fication the ground of their refu&s;ing to give effect to the part of the treaty which was fa|vourable to the troops. They knew al&s;o, that one of the principal objects of my return to England was to negotiate in behalf of that de|&s;erving body of &s;oldiers and &s;ubjects. Their de&s;ire of my delivering my&s;elf into captivity, at &s;uch a time, and under &s;uch circum&s;tances, ju&s;tified &s;omething more than a &s;u&s;picion, that in my ab&s;ence in was intended either to lay to my charge &s;ome breach of faith with the ene|my; or to renounce the treaty from the begin|ning; and by my &s;urrender, to transfer the act from the nation to my per&s;on. The&s;e are the only two ca&s;es which I believe can be produced from the hi&s;tory of nations, wherein an officer, who had made a convention with an enemy, had been delivered up to them. The ratifica|tion of the treaty afterwards is no proof that &s;uch intentions did not then exi&s;t.</P>
<P>I will make no farther ob&s;ervations, gentle|men, upon this fir&s;t corre&s;pondence between the War-Office and me; nor &s;hould I have troubled you with the&s;e, but that great pains are taken to divert the attention of the public from the pretended order, to my behaviour &s;ince the receipt of it. I in no wi&s;e &s;eek to evade the public judgment upon any thing I have done: but I claim from the impartial and
<PB N="13" REF="14">
the candid, a con&s;ideration of the pretended or|der it&s;elf, in its principal parts, <HI>viz.</HI> the ground upon which it is founded; the novel &s;pecies of cruelty which it &s;uppo&s;es within the power of the Crown; and la&s;tly, the exerci&s;e of &s;uch doctrine by men who were parties, and again&s;t the man whom they were called upon by their &s;tation and their honour to confront.</P>
<P>Nothing farther pa&s;&s;ed during the rece&s;s of Parliament. I availed my&s;elf of a di&s;cretio|nary power, as I had a right to do, and I made it no &s;ecret, that had a direct order been &s;ent me, I &s;hould have laid all my commi&s;&s;ions at his Maje&s;ty's feet.</P>
<P>During the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, an enquiry was in&s;tituted. The detail of the at|tempts made by the Mini&s;try to defeat it, is too notorious to be nece&s;&s;ary upon this occa|&s;ion. They at la&s;t contrived, that it &s;hould be left imperfect: but in &s;pight of every ma|nagement, it had an&s;wered my purpo&s;e &s;o far, as to &s;ix upon record a body of evidence, that I would not exchange for all that power could be&s;tow. It is a ju&s;tification of misfortune by the voice of Honour. It is there apparent what the army under my command, who felt mo&s;t and &s;aw be&s;t, thought of my actions.&mdash;The affections of my gallant comrades, un|&s;haken in every trial, labour, famine, captivi|ty, or death, enable me to de&s;pi&s;e the rancour of a cabal and all its con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t important purpo&s;e of my return to England having been an&s;wered by this
<PB N="14" REF="15">
vindication, I thought the &s;acrifice of my com|mi&s;&s;ions, the fruits of the greate&s;t part of my life, not to be nece&s;&s;ary. I knew by expe|rience, what I had to apprehend in point of health from an American winter; but I &s;corn|ed to plead it. Con&s;cious of my integrity, I abandoned my public accounts to the rigorous &s;crutiny of office; and I took occa&s;ion publicly to declare, that &s;hould it &s;till be thought expe|dient to deliver me back to the enemy, and a po&s;itive order &s;hould be &s;ent me for that pur|po&s;e, I &s;hould, as far as in me lay, obey it.</P>
<P>I do not believe any man who knows me doubted the &s;incerity of that intention. I am per&s;uaded, the framers of the letter of the 24th September were particularly convinced of it. The man who embarked in the &s;ituation I did, in the year 1776, could hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed to want fortitude to undertake an American voy|age, in the &s;ituation in which I made the de|claration. An order, therefore, which I could have obeyed without committing my honour, would not have effected my ruin. Time and circum&s;tances furni&s;hed more &s;ecure expedients; which I &s;hall now open.</P>
<P>Occa&s;ions were taken to vi&s;it my offences upon my friends. Examples re&s;pecting my neare&s;t connections need not be pointed out, when I am addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to any part of the county of Lanca&s;ter. But the principle extended far more wide; and did not the ap|prehen&s;ion of farther hurting the men I love
<PB N="15" REF="16">
re&s;train me, I could produce in&s;tances of hard|&s;hip in the di&s;tribution of military preferments, that no impartial per&s;on will impute to any other cau&s;e than the kindne&s;s and friend&s;hip of the parties to me.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;tances of per&s;ecution, it was well known, affected me deeply. There were others yet more irritating.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer, the apprehen|&s;ions before entertained of an inva&s;ion, by the declaration of government, became a certain|ty. Hardly a Briti&s;h &s;ubject could be found &s;o low, &s;o feeble, or even &s;o profligate, as to be exempted from &s;ervice; while uncommon premiums were rai&s;ed by begging, and di&s;tri|buted to volunteers, the goals, and even the feet of the gallows, were re&s;orted to for other recruits.</P>
<P>In this declared dilemma, I know govern|ment were not &s;trangers to my intention of fighting my own regiment as colonel; or, &s;hould its de&s;tination not admit the honour of meeting the enemy in that capacity, of offer|ing my&s;elf as a volunteer in the ranks of any corps that might be more fortunately &s;ituated.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everal feelings, and many others in|cident to an oppre&s;&s;ed man, were doubtle&s;s duly con&s;idered; for at the cri&s;is when they could operate mo&s;t forcibly, it was thought proper mo&s;t to in&s;ult me; at the cri&s;is when the King's &s;ervants openly announced, that not a &s;hip or a &s;oldier could be &s;pared from our
<PB N="16" REF="17">
internal defence, a &s;entence of bani&s;hment was &s;ent me, and even that not in an or|der, but a reprimand&mdash;a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to igno|miny was required of me; for to put me wholly out of a capacity to draw my &s;word at &s;uch a moment, was virtually, in point of di&s;grace, to break it over my head. My ene|mies might have &s;pared &s;uperfluous provoca|tions. This alone would have &s;ufficed to prove their &s;agacity, and to effect their purpo&s;e. Let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed they want knowledge of the human heart. There are among them, who can di&s;cern its rece&s;&s;es, and have the &s;kill and the triumph to make a &s;oldier's honour and &s;en&s;ibility the in&s;truments of his own de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>I could no longer brook the treatment I re|ceived. My letter, of the 9th October to the Secretary at War, [<HI>App. No.</HI> 5.] contains my general &s;entiments. I &s;hall now proceed to &s;tate to you, the principles of my parliamen|tary conduct &s;ince my return from America, for which I hold my&s;elf peculiarly and &s;trictly accountable to you, and which I have only po&s;tponed hitherto, to avoid interrupting the relation of my other proceedings.</P>
<P>I am ready to confe&s;s that I have been a de|termined oppo&s;er of the King's Mini&s;ters, but my oppo&s;ition has been the cau&s;e and not the con&s;equence of my ill treatment. Severity, ingratitude, or even inju&s;tice, though exer|ci&s;ed again&s;t me in the degree you have &s;een,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
I &s;hould think very in&s;ufficient rea&s;ons for &s;uch a determination. He would ill de&s;erve the tru&s;t of his country in its pre&s;ent exigen|cy who could act again&s;t men in public &s;ta|tion, upon any re&s;entments unconnected with public wrongs.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will take the matter &s;hort. If the &s;tate of the nation, in its wars; in its negociations; in its concerns with its remaining colonies; or in the internal policy and govern|ment of the&s;e kingdoms, can afford the &s;mal|le&s;t countenance to an opinion of integrity and capacity in admini&s;tration, I am ready to abide every cen&s;ure for being, what I am, a deter|mined enemy to it. I have been in a &s;ituation to &s;ee, that in a complicated and alarming war, when un&s;upported by any alliances, the king|dom was left &s;olely to its own native military force, that &s;ole reliance was di&s;couraged and depreciated. I &s;aw a &s;y&s;tematical de&s;ign of vilifying and di&s;gracing every officer whom the&s;e Mini&s;ters had ever employed by &s;ea or land; and tho&s;e mo&s;t who &s;tood highe&s;t in the opinion of their &s;everal profe&s;&s;ions. The ruin of officers forms almo&s;t the whole of their mi|litary &s;y&s;tem; and if I have experienced my full mea&s;ure of their ho&s;tility, it only &s;hews the extent of their plan; having furni&s;hed lit|tle el&s;e than my zeal and indu&s;try as a title to their malevolence.</P>
<P>As to their political plan, its object is to impo&s;e upon the nation from &s;e&s;&s;ion to &s;e&s;|&s;ion.
<PB N="18" REF="19">
Far from profiting them&s;elves, or &s;uf|fering others to profit by bitter experience, they exi&s;t by bringing forth a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of de|ceits. I cannot &s;hut my eyes again&s;t my own certain knowledge of &s;ome of the mo&s;t fatal of the&s;e deceits re&s;pecting America; nor re|&s;train my ju&s;t and natural indignation at their effects, without forfeiting every feeling for my country.</P>
<P>If this explanation appears warm, be a&s;&s;ured it is the warmth of conviction. Had my &s;en|timents been le&s;s &s;incere, my lot would have been very different.</P>
<P>But, in the&s;e times when &s;o little credit is given to principle in political matters, you may perhaps be told, that I have been follow|ing the dictates of party, and deluded by vain expectations of popularity to &s;acrifice my&s;elf to their pur&s;uits. My friends, I am &s;ure, would treat &s;uch an imputation with the &s;ame contempt they do every other illiberal cen|&s;ure; but I owe it to truth and propriety to ju&s;tify them. The men with whom I have the honour to act have no objects, but to &s;ave their country; if they had, they might long ago have obtained them; and they would &s;corn to accept, as I &s;hould to offer, an union upon any other terms than a participation of that cau&s;e.</P>
<P>My actions have been the mere re&s;ult of my own &s;entiments. My re&s;ignation in particular was made upon the impul&s;e of honour as it &s;truck my own brea&s;t: and why &s;hould it be
<PB N="19" REF="20">
thought &s;trange? I hope that under that in|fluence alone, I am capable of greater efforts than any I have made in relinqui&s;hing the libe|ral accommodations of a life, to which I have been u&s;ed; and of retreating into the compe|tence of a very private gentleman. It comes recommended by the reflection, that after being entru&s;ted with a con&s;iderable coffer of the &s;tate, and other opportunities opened of obtaining wealth at the undue expence of the public, my fortune is le&s;s than it would have been, had I never &s;erved in the American war.</P>
<P>It would be very contradictory to my &s;enti|ments of your characters to think this avow|al could be prejudicial to me at Pre&s;ton. In one of the mo&s;t violent election conte&s;ts known in England, and in &s;ome re&s;pects the mo&s;t expen&s;ive, the poore&s;t among the voters, I mention it equally to the honour of both parties, were uncorrupted. Should therefore the integrity of my intentions appear in this appeal, and the pa&s;t independence of my con|duct be con&s;idered as a pledge for the future, I have no fear that the reduction of between three and four thou&s;and pounds a year, will be an ob&s;truction to the honour of &s;erving you.</P>
<P>The tru&s;t of my country in parliament is too &s;acred in my &s;en&s;e to be renounced, while I am thought worthy to be continued in it. As for the other objects which mo&s;t intere&s;t the multitude, and once intere&s;ted me, my

<P>I HAVE con&s;idered the letter I had the ho|nour to recieve from your Lord&s;hip on the 5th in&s;tant, with the attention and re&s;pect due to an intimation of the King's plea&s;ure. I have now to reque&s;t your Lord&s;hip to lay before his Maje&s;ty a few particulars of my &s;ituation; and to offer to his royal con&s;ideration, with all humility on my part, &s;uch of my complaints as admit of repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>My letter to Sir William Howe, referred to in your Lord&s;hip's letter, was writ in the fulne&s;s of zeal to renew my &s;ervice in arms the en&s;uing campaign. The &s;atisfaction of &s;ucceeding in that application, would have tended to my recovery, or for a time might have prevented my feeling an ill. Deprived of &s;o animating a &s;upport, and vi&s;ited by new and unexpected anxieties. I have now recour&s;e only, as far as the mind is concerned, to a clear con&s;cience, perhaps a more tardy, but, I tru&s;t, as efficacious an a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on of the year, always fa|vourable to me, gives me the appearance, and indeed, in &s;ome degree the &s;en&s;ation of health. But much care is &s;till wanting to re&s;tore me to my former &s;tate. The remedies pre&s;cribed me are repo&s;e, regimen of diet, and repeated vi&s;its to Bath: my intention, in con&s;equence, was to remain &s;ome time in the country, to
<PB N="23" REF="24">
repair to Bath for a &s;hort time next month, and to return thither for a much longer &s;pace in the more proper &s;ea&s;on, the Autumn. But whatever may be the benefit of all or any part of this plan, I am per&s;uaded, that to ex|po&s;e my con&s;titution to the next American winter, is in probability to doom me to the grave.</P>
<P>That I &s;hould not he&s;itate at &s;uch an alter|native, in circum&s;tances of exigency, I am con|fident the King will admit, when in his grace he &s;hall recollect how often at his Maje&s;ty's call in this war, I have relinqui&s;hed private duties and affection more impul&s;ive upon the heart than any we owe to exi&s;tence. The purpo&s;es intimated for my pre&s;ent attendance in Ame|rica, would, I fear, be very different from &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The army I commanded, credulous in my favour, and attached to me by the &s;eries of conflicts and misfortunes we have in common &s;u&s;tained, would not find material con&s;olation from my return in di&s;grace; and their di&s;ap|pointment could not but be enhanced by &s;uch an indication, that Government either thought it inexpedient to ratify the convention of Sara|toga, or de&s;paired of a ratification effectuating the redemption of that army; for they would not conceive it po&s;&s;ible, had the return of the troops been in view, that any per&s;on would have advi&s;ed the King to what then might have appeared &s;o har&s;h an act as &s;ending
<PB N="24" REF="25">
an infirm, calumniated, unheard complainant, acro&s;s the Atlantic, merely to in&s;pect their em|barkation.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip will perceive the parts of this letter which apply to the council of the throne, from whence I am to &s;uppo&s;e the or|der I have recieved originated, and in your ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity you will guard me, my Lord, from any &s;uppo&s;able pre&s;umption of ex|po&s;tulating with the King in per&s;on. But I apply to the &s;ame qualities in your Lord&s;hip's mind, for pointing out to his Maje&s;ty, inde|pendently of his council, other letters, among tho&s;e tran&s;mitted to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, al|ledging other rea&s;ons, and tho&s;e more preva|lent than the attention to health for my return to England; and permit me, my Lord, to add, that every one of them receives ten-fold weight from what has happened lately, for my continuance in England. The &s;pecial rea&s;on upon which I chiefly re&s;t at pre&s;ent, my Lord, is a vindication of my honour.</P>
<P>Until that by full and proper trial is cleared to my Sovereign and to my coun|try, I confe&s;s I &s;hould feel a removal from hence, though enforced by the term duty, the &s;evere&s;t &s;entence of exile ever impo&s;ed; and when the time and circum&s;tances of &s;uch re|moval are farther con&s;idered, that Britain is threatened with inva&s;ion, and that after an enemy has &s;et my arm at liberty, I am for|bid a &s;hare in her defence by the council of

<OPENER><DATELINE>Hertford-Street, <DATE>October 9, 1779.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your letter acquainting me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that my not returning to America, and join|ing the troops, pri&s;oners under the conven|tion of Saratoga, is con&s;idered as a neglect of duty and di&s;obedience of orders, tran&s;mit|ted to me, by the Secretary at War, in his letter of 5th June, 1778."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28">
During a &s;ervice of more than thirty years, I have been taught by the rewards of two &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive Sovereigns, to believe, that my milita|ry conduct was held de&s;erving of more favour|able terms than tho&s;e which are applied to it in the above recital. I have received from his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty in particular, repeated and con&s;picuous te&s;timonies of di&s;tinction and good opinion: and I &s;hould have been the mo&s;t un|grateful of men, if I had not felt, and uni|formly endeavoured to mark the warme&s;t and mo&s;t dutiful attachment to his per&s;on, toge|ther with a punctilious per&s;everance in the ex|ecution of all his lawful commands.</P>
<P>Under this &s;en&s;e of my pa&s;t &s;ituation, your letter &s;tated to be written by the King's com|mand, cannot but affect me mo&s;t painfully.</P>
<P>The time in which I am charged with neg|lect of duty, has been employed to vindicate my own honour, the honour of the Briti&s;h troops, and of tho&s;e of his Maje&s;ty's allies, under my late command, from the mo&s;t ba&s;e and barbarous a&s;per&s;ions, that ever were forged again&s;t innocent men, by malignity &s;upported by power.</P>
<P>In regard to the &s;econd charge, I mu&s;t fir&s;t ob&s;erve that there were two letters from the late Secretary at War, upon the &s;ubject of my return to America: and though you only &s;tate that of the 5th of June, I conclude it is not meant, that the other of the 27th &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, as it is explanatory of the for|mer.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">
The &s;ignification of the King's plea&s;ure therein contained being clearly conditional, and the condition depending upon my own judgment; I am unable to conceive by what po&s;&s;ible con&s;truction it can be con&s;idered as di&s;obedience, that I have not fulfilled an op|tional condition; and I am ready, and de&s;i|rous to meet the judgment of a proper tribu|nal upon that, as upon every other part of my conduct.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Sir, I am not told who it is that con&s;iders my taking advantage of my parole for the purpo&s;es I have done, as a neg|lect of duty, and breach of orders, and has &s;o repre&s;ented it to his Maje&s;ty. But in this &s;tate of ignorance concerning my enemies, I mu&s;t &s;ay, as well from duty to my Sovereign, as from ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, that they who have abu&s;ed the confidence of their gracious Ma&s;ter, by &s;uch a gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation, merit, and I tru&s;t will meet with more of his di&s;plea&s;ure, than they wickedly have drawn upon me.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hment implied in the order refer|red to, you will ob&s;erve, Sir, is unu&s;ual as well as cruel. Whether the mini&s;ters of the crown, can legally order a Briti&s;h &s;ubject into captivity either at home or abroad without trial; or whether they can compel an officer by virtue of his general military obedience, to deliver him&s;elf to the pri&s;on of the enemy, without any requi&s;ition on their part, is (to &s;ay nothing &s;tronger of it) matter of &s;erious
<PB N="29" REF="30">
doubt. On pretence of military obedience, I am ordered to the only part of the world in which I can do no military &s;ervice. An ene|my's pri&s;on is not the King's garri&s;on, nor is any thing to be done or &s;uffered there, any part of an officer's duty; &s;o far from it that it implies a direct incapacity for any military function. What are the military orders I am to give to men who have no arms to fight, and no liberty to march? Or by what rule is my not being in the hands of rebels, under|&s;tood to be a neglect of duty to my Sovereign? Sir, the thing is too evident; tho&s;e who ca|lumniate my conduct on this account are de|&s;irous not of &s;erving the King, but of in|&s;ulting me, and of e&s;tabli&s;hing new, dange|rous, unmilitary and uncon&s;titutional powers in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>While a precedent is e&s;tabli&s;hing in my par|ticular ca&s;e, I reque&s;t it may moreover be re|membered that I am deprived of a court-mar|tial upon my conduct in America, becau&s;e I am not &s;uppo&s;ed to be amenable to the ju&s;tice of the kingdom: and the King is told I have di&s;obeyed his orders, in the very &s;ame breath that I am &s;tated not to be accountable to him: by this doctrine it &s;eems &s;uppo&s;ed, that I am not capable of receiving orders for the purpo&s;es of public ju&s;tice or public &s;ervice, but am perfectly &s;ubject to all &s;uch as have a tendency to my own de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But it has been &s;ugge&s;ted when no military duty could be devi&s;ed as a ground for this or|der
<PB N="30" REF="31">
that I might be returned to captivity in a &s;ort of civil capacity. To comfort my fellow pri&s;oners by a participation of their &s;ufferings, and to act as a commi&s;&s;ary to negociate for them. Could any &s;ufferings of mine alleviate the &s;malle&s;t of theirs, I &s;hould willingly &s;ub|mit to any thing the malice of the pre&s;ent mini|&s;ters could inflict upon me. But it is equally injurious to truth and to their honour and hu|manity, to &s;uppo&s;e that my per&s;ecution could make any part of their con&s;olation. What con&s;olation could they derive from my junc|tion to the common captivity, only to tell them that not a name among them is to be found in the numerous li&s;t of late promotions? And that the negoitations to be undertaken in their favour, are to be conducted by the man who is notoriou&s;ly pro&s;cribed by the power in the name of which he is to negotiate? Who alone of all the officers who have come from America, has been denied all acce&s;s to the King? Cruelly as I and my fellow &s;ufferers are treated, I can &s;carce bring my&s;elf to wi&s;h, that they who provide &s;uch comfort for others &s;hould receive it in a &s;imilar &s;ituation them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry finally to ob&s;erve that the treat|ment I have experienced, however contradicto|ry in the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for the &s;everal parts of it, is perfectly uniform in the principle. Thev who would not &s;uffer me to approach the King's pre&s;ence to vindicate my&s;elf before him;
<PB N="31" REF="32">
who have held that I cannot have a court-mar|tial to vindicate my&s;elf to my profe&s;&s;ion; and who have done all they could do, to prevent me from vindicating my&s;elf to my country by a parliamentary enquiry; are now very &s;y&s;tematically de&s;irous of burying my inno|cence and their own guilt, in the pri&s;ons of the enemy, and of removing, in my per&s;on, to the other &s;ide of the Atlantic Ocean, the means of renewing parliamentary proceedings which they have rea&s;on to dread.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e extraordinary attempts to oppre&s;s in my per&s;on the rights of all &s;ubjects, and to pervert every idea of military obedience, by directing it, not to the &s;ervice of the pu|blic, but the ruin of officers, ju&s;tified me to my own con&s;cience, in the part I took under the conditional order, referred to in your letter. I found the &s;ame inward ju&s;tification in requi|ring in the mo&s;t public manner, at the clo&s;e of the late &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, a clear, pe|remptory order, in ca&s;e the mini&s;ters per&s;eve|red in their intention of re&s;urrendering me to the enemy.</P>
<P>I have received no order; had an order been &s;ent to me framed in any manner that I could have acted upon it con&s;i&s;tently with the exi|&s;tence of character; I might have made a pro|te&s;t again&s;t the precedent, I might have en|quired of you, Sir, by what probable means in the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs it was to be executed. But in deference to the King's
<PB N="32" REF="33">
name, as a military &s;ervant, I meant &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion. Your letter, Sir, in&s;tead of an order for my future conduct is an unju&s;t reproach of my pa&s;t; for which I humbly implore of his Maje&s;ty and firmly demand of his councils, trial by a court-martial. Should that be refu|&s;ed or procra&s;tinated upon the principle for|merly adopted, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation no judicature can have cognizance of my actions;"</Q> I can then con&s;ider the purport of your letter, Sir, in no other light than that of a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion as conclu&s;ive as any you could have worded in form, and per|haps more poignant. To eat the bread of the Crown however faithfully earned, under a &s;entence, without appeal, in the name of the King, of neglect of duty and di&s;obedience of orders, is incompatible with my conception of honour; an interdiction from my country; a bani&s;hment to the only part of the world in which I am di&s;abled from &s;erving that country at the moment of her fate; and when every other arm, even to the weake&s;t is pre&s;&s;ed to her defence; the&s;e circum&s;tances give a critical barbarity to the intentions of the King's ad|vi&s;ers, that an Engli&s;h &s;oldier cannot &s;upport. Therefore, Sir, I find my&s;elf compelled, if not allowed an early trial, or by the King's grace, upon this repre&s;entation, re&s;tored to a capacity of &s;ervice, through your official channel to reque&s;t his Maje&s;ty, to accept of my re&s;ignation of my appointment upon the

<P>Having laid your letter before the King, I am commanded to acquaint you, that for the rea&s;ons &s;ubmitted to his Maje&s;ty by the Board of General Officers, in their report, dated 23d May, 1778, (which rea&s;ons &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the &s;ame force now as they did at that time) his Maje&s;ty does not think proper that any part of your conduct &s;hould be brought before a military tribunal, &s;o long as you &s;hall continue engaged to re-deliver your&s;elf into the power of Congre&s;s upon their demand and due notice being given by them. Nor does his Maje&s;ty think proper, in con&s;equence of the repre&s;entations contained in your &s;aid letter, to re&s;tore you, circum&s;tanced as you are, to a capacity of &s;ervice. Neither of the&s;e reque&s;ts can therefore be granted.</P>
<P>I have it farther in command from the King to acquaint you, that his Maje&s;ty con&s;iders your letter to me as a proof of your determi|nation to per&s;evere in not obeying his orders, &s;ignified to you in the Secretary at War's let|ter of the 5th June, 1778: and for this rea|&s;on, his Maje&s;ty is plea&s;ed to accept your re&s;ignation of the command of the Queen's regiment of Light Dragoons, of the govern|ment

of Fort William, and of your appoint|ment on the American &s;taff, allowing you only to re&s;erve the rank of Lieutenant General in the army, for the purpo&s;es you have &s;tated.</P>
<P>Lord Barrington's letter of the 27th of June is con&s;idered as explanatory of the orders given in his letter of the 5th of that month.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Hertford-Street, <DATE>October 17, 1779.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your letter of the 15th in|&s;tant, informing me, that his Maje&s;ty had been plea&s;ed to accept my re&s;ignation of my military employments, and that I am refu&s;ed a court-martial upon that di&s;obedience, for my per&s;everance in which, you tell me my re&s;igna|tion is accepted.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t per&s;i&s;t in denying, that I have re|ceived any other order, than an order &s;ubject to my own di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t per&s;i&s;t in my claim to a court-mar|tial.</P>
<P>I apprehend, that if I am not &s;ubject to a trial for breach of orders, it implies that I am not &s;ubject to the orders them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">
I do not admit that I cannot legally have a court-martial, circum&s;tanced as I am: but tho&s;e who advi&s;e his Maje&s;ty, a&s;&s;ert it, and they are an&s;werable for this contradiction be|tween their rea&s;oning and their conduct.</P>
<P>The report of the general officers, I hum|bly conceive, is erroneous. And the &s;ub&s;e|quent appointment of other gentlemen, ex|actly in my circum&s;tances (with great merit on their part to entitle them to any di&s;tinc|tion) to military employments, &s;ubject to or|ders, and accountable for the breach of them, is one of the rea&s;ons for my conceiving, that the King's advi&s;ers do not differ from me in opinion, that the general officers were mi|&s;taken.</P>
<P>Thinking it probable, Sir, that this letter may clo&s;e the corre&s;pondence between us, I conclude with the &s;entiments I have never de|viated from in any part of it; and I reque&s;t you to a&s;&s;ure his Maje&s;ty, with all humility on my part, that though I have rea&s;on to complain heavily of his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, my mind is deeply impre&s;&s;ed, as it ever has been, with a &s;en&s;e of duty, re&s;pect, and affec|tion to his royal per&s;on.</P>
