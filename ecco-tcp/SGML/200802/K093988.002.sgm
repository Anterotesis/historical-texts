<P>_I SET off in <HI>Thur&s;day</HI>'s Stage, the 25th In&s;tant; and beg you will get &s;ome Lodging for me.</P>
<P>I received a Letter from you on <HI>Saturday</HI> la&s;t, and another this Day: And, fir&s;t, of the fir&s;t. I am very glad you got &s;afe to Town: But why all this Plaintivene&s;s? Why will you eternally doubt my Tenderne&s;s for
<PB N="2" REF="3">
you? Ob&s;erve, that there is a childi&s;h, and a manly one: Perhaps I am a Child in every thing el&s;e; and then one may &s;u&s;pect, if I do not appear &s;o in this, it is becau&s;e I want the Feeling: But if you will allow me to be a Man in other Things, why will you not judge of me all together? If my Letters and Behaviour differ, it is becau&s;e one proceeds from the Senti|ments I have toward you, and the other from a certain Nonchalance, or Want of Earne&s;tne&s;s in my Manners, which has been often mi&s;|interpreted.</P>
<P>What you &s;ay with regard to Love and Friend&s;hip is certainly ju&s;t, as it is ingenious al&s;o. The Plea&s;ures of tho&s;e Affections are the greate&s;t Enjoyments of Life: How careful ought we then to be to cheri&s;h them in their proper Sea&s;on! which does not extend even &s;o far as you mention: And yet we have a long Life to labour through after that Aera, which would lag heavily along without tho&s;e Helps.</P>
<P>The Opinion of a continued Conver&s;e after Death has been often di&s;puted, and by me too: But I will come over to your Sentiment, for this conclu&s;ive Rea&s;on; We are to be happy after Death. Providence always acts by the mo&s;t continued, uniform, and con&s;tant Means. Love and Friend&s;hip are the highe&s;t Enjoyments of Mortals: They are likewi&s;e in the Series of Virtue. Would it not be Caprice in Provi|dence,
<PB N="3" REF="4">
to give us new Objects, and &s;trange Affections, when we can be made as happy by the Improvement of the former, as by the Enjoyment of any other? I will never change my Opinion more on this Subject, for your Sake, my &s;weet Girl, who&s;e Charms (pardon the Quibble) I wi&s;h to enjoy, both above and below; and in that Wi&s;h I live, and in that Hope I die,</P>

<P>THOUGH I have been, ever &s;ince I came to Town, overwhelmed with Bu&s;ine&s;s, I cannot &s;ay that I am di&s;plea&s;ed at this Embarras du Monde, as it prevents my having Lei&s;ure to indulge gloomy Reflections, which are the cer|tain Con&s;equence of Indolence and Inactivity: And, though my Spirits are too weak to bear much Fatigue, I would prefer the mo&s;t labo|rious Life to the melancholy Hours I &s;ometimes pa&s;s; not for Want of Employment, but Re&s;o|lution to employ my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am, however, far from being &s;atisfied with my pre&s;ent Condition; for I, almo&s;t hourly,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
find the Want of a rea&s;onable Companion; who, by participating in my Concerns, or ap|proving my Actions, would double my A&s;&s;i|duity, and, of cour&s;e, my Succe&s;s. And this leads me to mention two Things I have often thought of&mdash;Fir&s;t, Providence certainly de&s;igned us &s;ocial Creatures; and that our greate&s;t Hap|pine&s;s on Earth, and &s;tronge&s;t Pur&s;uit, is the Enjoyment of a rational and tender Friend&s;hip; which cannot be attained without devoting the greate&s;t and be&s;t Part of our Lives to this &s;ingle Purpo&s;e; for I am thoroughly con|vinced, that &s;incere Love, or real Friend&s;hip, never was contracted after the Age of Forty: The Mind then takes another Turn, grows callous to the tender, &s;oft Impre&s;&s;ions of Hu|manity, and is in Pur&s;uit of Enjoyments directly oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e, the fir&s;t, and be&s;t&mdash;unle&s;s before engaged in the dear Tyes of Hu&s;band, or of Friend; if &s;o, each Day adds Strength to the ble&s;t Union, and &s;teals the Sting from Sorrow and from Care. Can we then, my deare&s;t Life, without arraigning the Goodne&s;s and Wi&s;dom of the divine Being, &s;uppo&s;e that, from the highe&s;t Excellence of our Nature, we &s;hould be engaged in laudable Pur&s;uits, which are to take up the be&s;t and happie&s;t Part of our Lives; and that, after having been at innu|merable Pains to obtain them, the Enjoyment &s;hould cea&s;e, ju&s;t when we are capable of it,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
by putting off this frail Mortality? No&mdash;it cannot be! With thee I'll range the liquid Fields of Air, wander through all the Immen&s;ity of Bli&s;s, and find none equal to thy dear So|ciety; &s;o fix my Heaven there.</P>
<P>I grow quite an Enthu&s;ia&s;t on this Subject, and, of cour&s;e, talk an infinite deal of Non&s;en&s;e; but &s;ure you will excu&s;e me, when I &s;olemnly declare, I have no Idea of Happine&s;s, either in this World or the next, un&s;hared by thee.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Thing I have to mention is, my Surprize at your being able to live &s;o long alone; "for, in Unequals, what Society?" And &s;ure you appear to me like <HI>Adam,</HI> before
<Q>the la&s;t and be&s;t of all God's Works</Q>
was formed, dignified with, and con&s;cious of that Superiority he felt, amid&s;t his va&s;&s;al Brutes: Yet could Equality alone render Society agreeable to you, you mu&s;t, indeed, condemn your&s;elf to a per|petual Solitude; for, in that Ca&s;e, I know not where it would be po&s;&s;ible for you to find a Companion.</P>
<P>I am but ju&s;t come home from Lady &mdash;'s. My Watch lies on the Table, and points to Twelve; &s;o I mu&s;t bid you a thou&s;and Times Good-Night!</P>

<P>I AM come &s;o far on my Way to <HI>London,</HI> and &s;hall be able to receive ju&s;t one Letter from you, before I leave it. My Uncle is in the Gout, which will not mend his Temper; and the three Women, I left behind me, are in a hopeful Way with him, and he, of con&s;equence, extremely unhappy with them; for Providence has ordered it's eternal Laws &s;o equitably, that whoever makes another unhappy, by Perver&s;ene&s;s of Temper, makes him&s;elf no le&s;s &s;o. I have more Indulgence for great Vices, than for this peevi&s;h, un&s;ociable Humour, which Men ab|&s;urdly contract at that Stage of Life, when they &s;tand mo&s;t in need of all the friendly, amu&s;ing, and &s;ocial Helps, to aid them through. The other Vices have Nature on their Side, or Al|lurements and Temptations, to excu&s;e them; but Moro&s;ene&s;s is contrary to Nature, (who diffu&s;es Chearfulne&s;s among all her Works) and is al&s;o a Self-torment in the very Exerci&s;e. As I have often &s;aid, I look'd upon Chearfulne&s;s to be an Hymn to Providence, as well as a &s;trong Indication of a virtuous Mind, &s;o, I am almo&s;t bold to affirm, that Ill-humour is Bla&s;phemy in the Act, and a moral Vice in the Di&s;po&s;ition:
<PB N="7" REF="8">
Nay, to prove it a Vice, by the &s;trict Rules of Logic, I affirm it to be a Thing diametrically oppo&s;ite to the Nature of Virtue; for, as that is it's own Reward, this is it's own Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved by <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> that few People have all the Qualities requi&s;ite to render Life agreeable: But there are two indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary, which are in every one's Power; Chearfulne&s;s and Con&s;tancy. Now he who wants either of the&s;e, &s;hould be condemned; while tho&s;e, who fall &s;hort in the Gifts of Nature, ought only to be pitied. Here it may be proper to &s;ay &s;omething in my own Defence, who &s;eem to labour under this Rule, in <HI>&s;ome People</HI>'s Opinion; but ob&s;erve, that there may be Chearfulne&s;s without Mirth, and Con&s;tancy with Profe&s;&s;ing.</P>

<P>IT may &s;eem idle to write you a Letter now, which you will get but a few Hours before I &s;ee you; but I do it, perhaps, to &s;hew you, I have not &s;o paltry a Con&s;ideration for you, as
<PB N="8" REF="9">
the &s;aving you a Groat; though I am &s;ure, as I have no Letter of your's to an&s;wer, that I &s;hall not be able to &s;ay any thing which can defray the Expence.</P>
<P>Our A&s;&s;izes ended this Day, by the Execu|tion of all the Condemned; among whom was <HI>John&s;on,</HI> a Rogue of &s;ome Con&s;equence. When I heard the Guards coming down the Street, I retired to a back Room, as it is not a Spectacle I care to look on; but, con&s;idering it as an Object which might give Occa&s;ion to &s;ome u&s;eful Reflections, I returned, and &s;aw them pa&s;s by. The fir&s;t Thought which occurred to me was, that I &s;hould be glad to have been, for &s;ome Time, in their Situation, out of Curio&s;ity, to know how a Man feels, or imagines, in &s;uch &s;hocking Circum&s;tances; for the mere De&s;crip|tion of any thing does not &s;ufficiently &s;atisfy me. I &s;hould be al&s;o glad, more particularly, to know how I &s;hould behave my&s;elf, upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion; whether I &s;hould feel my&s;elf mo&s;t concerned for my Crime, or &s;hocked at the Puni&s;hment; whether my Hopes, through the Merit of Repentance, would be &s;ufficient to &s;up|port me through the Terrors; if the Shame, or Pain, would afflict me mo&s;t; whether I &s;hould act like a Madman, or a Fool; and, la&s;tly, whether I could have Strength of Mind &s;ufficient to &s;upport that calm and philo&s;ophic Temper at my Death, which great Part of my Life has
<PB N="9" REF="10">
been laid out in endeavouring to attain. With regard to the Wretches them&s;elves, I had one comfortable Reflection, which will henceforward take off greatly from the Shock, which Execu|tions of this Kind give to the humane Mind: That few of &s;uch Creatures ever reclaim of them&s;elves; but, proceeding in a Series of Ini|quities, die without Repentance. In this the executed Malefactor has a great Advantage above the Rogue who e&s;capes. The condemned Man has that Benefit which the P&s;almi&s;t prays for &s;o emphatically:
<Q>Teach me, O Lord, &s;o to number my Days, that I may apply my Heart unto Wi&s;dom!</Q>
And I think, that the highe&s;t Crimes, &s;incerely repented of, &s;hall meet more Favour in the next World, than le&s;&s;er Offences, unattoned by Sorrow and Contrition. I &s;hall pur&s;ue the&s;e Gallows Meditations no farther; but only ob&s;erve to you, the powerful Effect of this great Salvo of Repentance, towards the per|fect Quieti&s;m of a Mind, the lea&s;t imbued with Religion, though untutored by Philo&s;ophy, in the In&s;tance of <HI>John&s;on,</HI> this Day; who, ju&s;t before he mounted the Ladder, declared he would not change his pre&s;ent Situation with any Man in the World.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CLXXXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM, at pre&s;ent, &s;itting in the mid&s;t of a large Field of Barley, which I reaped the other Day; and am taking Care of the Binders and Stackers: There are forty-&s;even Women, and fourteen Men, at Work round about me, while I am reading <HI>Pliny,</HI> and writing to you.</P>
<P>I think Lord <HI>Orrery</HI>'s Comment upon the &s;eventh Epi&s;tle is extremely fine. The eighth Epi&s;tle of <HI>Pliny</HI> has a great Noblene&s;s of Senti|ment, and a particular Ju&s;tne&s;s of Thought. I love the fine Struggle between natural Vanity, and the Contempt of Prai&s;e; which is obvious through the whole Letter. It may be Stoici&s;m, if you plea&s;e; but I never will admit any Pre|tence to Virtue to be true Heroi&s;m, which &s;eems to be above human Nature, 'till it has fir&s;t &s;hewn its Strife with the Frailties of it. The ninth Epi&s;tle was always a Favourite of mine: But there was a Note I expected from Lord <HI>Orrery</HI> upon this Pa&s;&s;age,
<Q>Thou art <HI>almo&s;t</HI> preferable,</Q>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> There is no Doubt but <HI>Pliny,</HI> if he had con&s;ulted his own Ta&s;te and Inclinations, would have left out that Adverb, and put in <HI>omnino,</HI> or <HI>altogether</HI>: But the Philo|&s;ophers
<PB N="11" REF="12">
were obliged to &s;peak of the tranquil Joys of retired Contemplation, and learned Lei&s;ure, with &s;ome Caution and Re&s;erve; either becau&s;e the Antients had &s;o often &s;poken, and written, in &s;uch Raptures of the&s;e Plea&s;ures, that the World had got into a Kind of Enthu|&s;ia&s;m, which alarmed Governments and States; and the more particularly for this Rea&s;on, that tho&s;e Men, who are fitte&s;t for the World, are mo&s;t fond of retiring from it; or el&s;e <HI>Pliny</HI> moderated his ec&s;tatic Soliloquy, becau&s;e he could not think a Man, who was retired from all Bu&s;ine&s;s, could be quite &s;o virtuous, or, at lea&s;t, capable of exerci&s;ing &s;o much Virtue, as one who employed him&s;elf in the Affairs of this World; for &s;ome Part of the Duty of a Man, born a &s;ocial Creature, mu&s;t be neglected.</P>
<P>In the Comment upon the tenth Epi&s;tle, there is poetical Wit in the Allu&s;ion to <HI>Ajax</HI>'s Shield. There is an Expre&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame Comment, which I think exceptionable: Speaking of the young Men among the <HI>Romans,</HI> he calls them <HI>Gentlemen</HI>; which, being a modern Phra&s;e, is improperly applied, when we are &s;peaking of the Antients.</P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervations upon the eleventh Epi&s;tle are very pretty, and very ju&s;t; and plea&s;e me particularly, becau&s;e they flatter me about a Sentiment you may remember of mine, that
<Q><PB N="12" REF="13">
Ab&s;ence to Friends, like Death to Enemies, buries every Fault, and enlivens every Virtue.</Q></P>
<P>In the la&s;t Paragraph of the Comment upon the 20th Epi&s;tle, there is a good deal of Wit and Ju&s;tne&s;s in the Simile of Lightning. There is al&s;o &s;omething extremely pretty in the Anno|tation to the &s;econd Epi&s;tle of the &s;econd Book, in the Allu&s;ion to the Flux and Reflux of the Sea. The &s;ixth Epi&s;tle of the &s;ame Book plea&s;es me much. I have been always offended, when I have &s;een &s;uch improper and paltry Di&s;tinctions at very good Tables, which I have often done; and always made it a Rule with my&s;elf, to take Part with the de&s;pi&s;ed Gue&s;t, which has &s;ome|times had the proper Effect upon the Enter|tainer.</P>
<P>I received your Letter, with Lady &mdash;'s in|clo&s;ed, and am much obliged to her for re|membering me, which it &s;eems &s;he does, by mentioning Lord &mdash;. I know already, that I am not to expect any thing from her Kind|ne&s;s, in that Particular; for I mentioned to you before Mr. &mdash;'s An&s;wer to my Letter, on that Head. Now, as I have a Way of profiting &s;omething from every Di&s;appointment in Life, I &s;hall, from this, have the Satisfaction of feeling the grateful Sen&s;e of Lady &mdash;'s Patronage, pure and unmixed, for the Friend&s;hip &s;he de|&s;igned me; whereas, had I &s;ucceeded, my Acknowledgments might be looked upon
<PB N="13" REF="14">
rather as a Rejoicing at the Emoluments of it, than a Gratitude for the Favour it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now have at her Lady&s;hip's <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A Paragraph of a Letter, inquiring after three or four Per&s;ons, under the Characters of A, B, C, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> Cri&s;s-Cro&s;s&mdash; A, then, is <GAP DESC="blank"> B is <GAP DESC="blank"> C &s;pends his.

<P><PB N="14" REF="15">The fourth Letter in the Alphabet is, of cour&s;e, D; but either the Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of her Lady&s;hip's Typography, or my own ready Adaption of the Letter, has made me fix on O, which, from the Figure, being the mo&s;t perfect in Geometry, &s;eems to bear the neare&s;t Analogy to the Per&s;on decyphered by it. O! may our Loves, our Joys, our Days, end, like the Circle, as they have begun! (for I keep no Record of Time before our fir&s;t Acquaintance) and may our Wi&s;hes, like that too, have but one common Center!</P>
<P>I am concerned at your Apprehen&s;ions about Lady <HI>L</HI>&mdash;'s Face; but more for her as a Child, than as a Woman: For Beauty is de&s;irable, when we can expect nothing better; but a Woman may be amiable, without a Symmetry of Features; which I cannot in&s;tance in you, becau&s;e I think you hand&s;ome; but Lady &mdash; may fill the Example, as &s;he was never reckoned a Beauty: And may the Mother's Fortune at|tend the Child, to mi&s;s a Fop, and gain a Man of Sen&s;e!</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for the Accident which happened to your Eye: But, if it ends only in a Blemi&s;h, I am quite ea&s;y; for Mens &s;ana in Corpore &s;ano completes all my Wi&s;hes, with Regard to you.</P>

Writings of this Kind have admirable Effects upon a Mind rightly turned: They have quelled all Ambition in me: They have recon|ciled me to Poverty, rendered me luke-warm to Fame, have comforted me in Affliction, have even alleviated Pain, and taken away the Ter|rors of Death: At the &s;ame Time, they have enlivened my Hope, enlarged my Views, and opened &s;uch a glorious Pro&s;pect into Eternity, that the Mind's Eye but carele&s;sly glances over every Object, which lies intermediate to it; yet not with &s;uch an intemperate Enthu&s;ia&s;m, as to hinder a thorough Re&s;ignation to the Di&s;pen|&s;ations of Providence; for I contemplate the Joys of Eternity, without any Impatience for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them; which is owing to the ad|mirable Contrivance of the Almighty, who has given us &s;uch a Self-Conviction of the Plea&s;ures of Hereafter, as may make us re&s;t in Hope; but re&s;trained us from &s;uch a Sen&s;e of them, as might render us impatient in our Wi&s;hes.</P>

How earne&s;tly, how pa&s;&s;ionately do I wi&s;h to &s;hare tho&s;e rational Delights, which he can, at once, partake and in&s;pire! How "<HI>altogether preferable</HI>" &s;hould I think it, to be &s;eated by him on an Hillock of Hay, contemplating the Works of Nature, while he deduced each obvious Effect from it's fir&s;t great Principle; and made me lo&s;e all Wonder, in Prai&s;e and Gratitude to that Almighty Being, who fir&s;t created, and then made him mine!</P>
<P>I &s;ay, how much &s;hould I prefer that happy Situation to a Throne, without thee, thou deare&s;t and mo&s;t charming of thy Sex! Nor will I doubt, that my &s;haring would enhance the Plea&s;ures of Retirement; for Solitude's the Nur&s;e of Love, as well as Contemplation; and I am very &s;ure, were we to live but a few Months in a calm &s;ettled Way together, you would be infinitely fonder of me than you are, or can be, at pre&s;ent; as I make no doubt but we &s;hould then experience the charming Theory you have &s;omewhere laid down:
<Q>Chearfulne&s;s without Mirth, Gravity without Spleen, and
<PB N="18" REF="19">
the warme&s;t Love with the highe&s;t E&s;teem.</Q>
&mdash;You will, perhaps, be &s;urprized, when I tell you, that I now rejoice at what I have &s;ome|times looked on as the greate&s;t Misfortune of my Life; that we have not lived together. We &s;hould have been mi&s;erable, if that had hap|pened two Years ago. It is but a very &s;hort Time, &s;ince I became thoroughly acquainted with you: That Knowledge has increa&s;ed my Love and E&s;teem for you. You have intro|duced me to my&s;elf: Need I &s;ay, that, by knowing my&s;elf, I have triumphed over my greate&s;t Foible? And &s;ure I cannot err greatly, after your pointing out my Faults, when I declare, in the Sincerity of my Heart, that I have no Will of my own, nor Wi&s;h, but that of rendering my little Self agreeable to you.&mdash;If it were not a Work of Supererogation, I could even wi&s;h that I had greater Failings to &s;urmount, as they would be a &s;till &s;tronger Proof of your Love and mine.</P>
<P>Though I remember the Subject of each par|ticular Letter you mention in <HI>Pliny,</HI> I will not pretend to &s;peak my Sentiments, as I have not the Books by me; if I had, I &s;hould certainly &s;tart Objections, for the Plea&s;ure of being re|futed by you.</P>
<P>I have not been at the Rock the&s;e ten Days: I have lain in <HI>Bond-Street</HI> &s;ince I came to Town, and am almo&s;t killed with Raking. I &s;hall not
<PB N="19" REF="20">
leave <HI>London</HI> 'till <HI>Kitty</HI> does. I know you will be a little angry with this Account of my&s;elf, 'till you recollect, that I have not &s;een her for &s;ome Months, and that the greate&s;t Part of our Conver&s;ation is about you; which being a Sub|ject I &s;hall never be weary of, I cannot think of quitting it without Reluctance.</P>
<P>With your's I received a long Letter from Lady &mdash;. I think, according to your Defi|nition of it, the Letter O is much better adapted to her than to me; for &s;he is, indeed, the Center of female Perfection. By her De&s;ire, I inclo&s;e you Lord &mdash;'s Letter. Nothing can be more elegant than your Sentiments, with Regard to her Intentions to &s;erve you.</P>
<P>I am va&s;tly anxious to know what you have determined about <HI>Belvidere.&mdash;Kitty</HI> is tearing the Pen out of my Hand: When &s;hall I be able to write, or conver&s;e with you, &s;ans Interruption? I can no longer with&s;tand the Riot round me; but, though they force my Hand away, my Heart is unalterably your's.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the Po&s;t for this Day is not come in, I do not know yet, whether you leave Town To-morrow or no; therefore I &s;hall write to you, becau&s;e I would not &s;pare my&s;elf any Trouble certain, for even the Chance of giving you a Quarter of an Hour's Amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>I met with a &s;mall Treati&s;e Ye&s;terday, intitled, "On the Employment of Time." It is wrote by <HI>Gilbert We&s;t.</HI> I think it is very well <HI>collected</HI>; for, indeed, it is mo&s;tly a Heap of Quotations, and &s;hews more of Learning than Under&s;tand|ing: For a Work of this Kind almo&s;t any Man may <HI>compile,</HI> who reads with a Common-place Book by him.</P>
<P><HI>Young,</HI> the Satiri&s;t, has two very &s;evere Lines again&s;t Quotations, which, for that Rea&s;on, I &s;hall not recite; and there is certainly nothing &s;o tire&s;ome to the Reader as Writings of that Kind, which are only to be admitted in Works of Fancy, but not at all nece&s;&s;ary upon moral or philo&s;ophical Subjects. For Example; If Mr. <HI>We&s;t</HI> &s;peaks Sen&s;e or Rea&s;on, what Occa&s;ion is there to inform us, that <HI>Cicero</HI> thought the &s;ame Way, or &s;aid the &s;ame Thing? It is Argument, not Authority, which convinces. All Know|ledge
<PB N="21" REF="22">
is derived originally from the human Under&s;tanding; and a Thought is neverthele&s;s our own, becau&s;e it has been hit on by &s;ome|body el&s;e before: And one may as well quote <HI>Adam</HI> for breathing, becau&s;e he was the fir&s;t Creature who did &s;o, as <HI>Euclid</HI> for &s;aying that the three Angles of every Triangle are equal to two right ones, becau&s;e, he was the fir&s;t Per&s;on who demon&s;trated that Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>A quoting Author is ju&s;t as ridiculous as a Country Girl, who, upon her fir&s;t coming to Town, being decked out by the Help of her Friends, &s;hould make public Acknowledgment from whom &s;he had her Stockings, her Shift, her Stays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that, if every Per&s;on was there to claim their own; &s;he would be left as naked as the Jay in the Fable, or as &s;uch a pye|bald Author, &s;ay Writer rather, &s;ay Complier, &s;ay Publi&s;her, &s;ay &s;econd-hand Cook, who gives you a Beggar's Di&s;h out of Fragments, or &s;ay Printer's Sign-Po&s;t, upon which are pa&s;ted the heterogeneous Scraps of many Authors.</P>
<P>I remember a &s;tupid Sort of Fellow, who u&s;ed to put me in mind of the&s;e Men, who are too mode&s;t to &s;ay any Thing of their own; for he never a&s;ked for Bread, Drink, told you what o'Clock it was, or mentioned even the mo&s;t trifling Occurrence, without adding,
<Q>as the Man &s;aid:</Q>
And whenever he had a mind, like the&s;e Men, to &s;hew the Extent of his
<PB N="22" REF="23">
Learning, by recurring up to the mo&s;t antient Authority, he would cry,
<Q>as the Man &s;aid <HI>a great while ago.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Importance of the Subject, which Mr. <HI>We&s;t</HI> treats on, is great, and ought to be the frequent Reflection of every Man of Sen&s;e, Morality, or Religion. He has con&s;idered it with Regard to the two la&s;t, and placed the Matter in &s;everal very &s;trong Lights: But, as a Thing of this Con&s;equence cannot &s;tand in too many Points of View, I &s;hall attempt to con&s;ider it with Relation to the fir&s;t, merely as a rational Man, without any Regard to Virtue; relative only to our pre&s;ent State, and, in that Re&s;pect, confined intirely to our&s;elves: Which few Hints you may &s;tile, <HI>Of the Oeconomy of Time</HI>&mdash;Of the &s;imple Enlargement of it&mdash;Or, a certain Method to lengthen Life, in Spight of Fate, or of the Grave.</P>
<P>There is an Expre&s;&s;ion often made u&s;e of by thoughtle&s;s People, which a&s;toni&s;hes and provokes me extremely;
<Q>Let us do &s;o and &s;o, to kill Time.</Q>
It is &s;ome Revenge, however, to ob&s;erve, what Suicides they are, at the &s;ame Time of this mo&s;t horrid and unnatural Murder: So true it is, that We and our Time mu&s;t live and die together. We generally lament the Shortne&s;s of Man's Life taken together, while we are blaming the Tediou&s;ne&s;s of every Portion of it. This Contradiction may be accounted
<PB N="23" REF="24">
for, if we con&s;ider, that as Time, unemployed, lags heavily along, an idle Per&s;on, for this Rea&s;on, mu&s;t complain of tire&s;ome Days; and as Duration is marked only by the Succe&s;&s;ion of Ideas, his Life mu&s;t appear &s;horte&s;t, who has fewe&s;t Actions or Pa&s;&s;ages to recollect.</P>
<P>To con&s;ider Man, then, only with Regard to this Life; What a mi&s;erable Wretch mu&s;t he be, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ing Minutes are told as &s;o many Hours, and who&s;e pa&s;t Years are reflected upon but as &s;o many Days!</P>
<P>Let us then, as rational Creatures, contrive &s;o to employ our&s;elves in a Series of Actions, which, by marking every Period of our Lives, we may enjoy this great and happy Advantage, that the pre&s;ent Moments &s;hall glide imper|ceptibly away, and our pa&s;t Age appear &s;o long, upon &s;umming up, that we may not murmur at the &s;hort Span "of three&s;core Years and ten."</P>
<Q>O Vita Stulto longa, Sapienti brevis!</Q>
<P>Again, 'tis computed, that the generality of Men &s;leep away about one Third of their Time, that is, about eight Hours in the twenty-four. Now five Hours is full &s;ufficient for any Per&s;on, who would pre&s;erve Health of Body, and Vigour of Mind: So that there may be above three Hours &s;aved out of every Day, which is about one Day in the Week, and that is one Year in &s;even. Then, by the Time a Man has reached
<PB N="24" REF="25">
his grand Climacteric, he may be &s;aid to have lived ju&s;t nine Years more than &s;ome of his twin Cotemporaries.</P>
<P>What would a Man give for nine Years added to &s;ixty-three! How much more valuable are nine Years before &s;ixty-three! for &s;urely that Time is the mo&s;t preferable, which we can live without growing older. We cannot, indeed, borrow Time from Death; but we can take it from it's Semblance, Sleep &mdash; Which brings me to the Clo&s;e of my Propo&s;ition, or
<Q>a certain Method to lengthen Life, in Spight of Fate, or the Grave.</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CLXXXVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read the Treati&s;e you mention, but like your Supplement to it much better. It is a double Charity to write to me on Subjects at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e there is not a Book in this Hou&s;e, which could &s;upply me with Matter for a Minute's Reflection; which makes the Time, except what I &s;pend in reading your Letters, or writing to you, pa&s;s like an idle Dream, which leaves no Trace behind.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">Your Letter has made me grow quite im|patient at the Reflection of having lo&s;t &s;o much of my Life. The De&s;ire of improving my Mind, and fixing it's Contemplation upon proper Objects, increa&s;es daily; yet, by &s;ome unfore&s;een Accident, I find my&s;elf continually deprived even of one Day's Retirement, and am, if I may u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion, con&s;tantly immer&s;ed in Idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>The Tediou&s;ne&s;s of pre&s;ent Time is often irk&s;ome to the wi&s;e Man as well as the Fool, though not in &s;o great a Degree; which has been con&s;idered as a Proof of the Soul's Immor|tality: For we are continually pu&s;hing forward to &s;ome Point of Time, which, when arrived at, falls &s;hort of the Expectations we had rai&s;ed upon it; we &s;till per&s;i&s;t in flattering our&s;elves, and fix our Happine&s;s on &s;ome future Period, which, in it's Cour&s;e, brings Di&s;appointment too; and yet we &s;till go on, wi&s;hing the pre&s;ent Hour were pa&s;t, and hoping Peace or Joy from &s;ome more di&s;tant Aera; 'till the Grave open|ing, interrupts our Schemes, and &s;hews the only Pro&s;pect where the Soul can re&s;t. Oh! may we fix our Gra&s;p on that Strong-Hold, which cannot, will not fail us; and, like the Patriarch, wre&s;tle for a Ble&s;&s;ing! Let the incumbering World recede, and even our mutual Loves decay, before the glorious Hope of Immortality! What Joy, what more than Tran&s;port, do I
<PB N="26" REF="27">
feel, in thinking that, when Death &s;hall have di&s;&s;olved the poor, infirm, and feeble Forms, which now inca&s;e our Spirits, we &s;hall meet again, con&s;cious of each other's Love and Truth, in perfect Bli&s;s above!</P>
<P>I do not cordially approve of your le&s;&s;ening the Portions of Time allotted for Sleep. It is wi&s;e Nature prompts, and all Philo&s;ophy is vain which dares oppo&s;e her. She has appointed equal Periods to Labour and to Re&s;t; while Man, impatient to be happy, &s;teals from his only promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ing, Ea&s;e, to &s;quander in the vain Pur&s;uit of Wealth or Plea&s;ure. I mu&s;t own, notwith&s;tanding your philo&s;ophical Moral, which I acknowledge to be very ingenious, that I am a great Friend to Sleep, whom <HI>Silius Italicus</HI> calls the mo&s;t amiable of all the Gods. When tired out with Grief or Pain, it &s;trengthens and renews the Springs of Life; we wake refre&s;hed, and feel a Kind of &s;ilent Hymn of Gratitude ari&s;e in our Minds for this, more than for any other Ble&s;&s;ing. While we &s;leep, we are, at lea&s;t, negatively good, incapable of acting or de&s;igning Ill; and I am afraid, that even the be&s;t Man has more to an&s;wer for his wakin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> than his &s;leeping Hours, be he never &s;o great a Sluggard. However, I &s;hall receive one Advan|tage from your Doctrine, that I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon your Practice keeping up to your Preaching; and I will certainly produce your Letter again&s;t

you, whenever I find you begin to yawn about Ten o'Clock; for that is a mo&s;t unrea&s;onable <HI>Hour</HI> for a Per&s;on to go to Bed, who has not Occa&s;ion to &s;leep more than <HI>five.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR'S of the 19th I &s;hall an&s;wer, by de&s;iring you to look into that Letter of mine, which gave you Occa&s;ion to &s;peak upon this Head; and you will find, that I did not &s;ay my Philo&s;ophy prevented me from feeling. A Man may be very &s;en&s;ible of the Gout or Stone, without roaring &mdash; nay, more &s;o, for the Expre&s;&s;ion of either Grief or Pain is ob&s;erved to le&s;&s;en the Poignancy of them. I would &s;ay with <HI>Romeo,</HI> "hang up Philo&s;ophy," indeed, if it &s;erved to extingui&s;h in my Brea&s;t the lea&s;t Part of that manly Love, that tender Friend&s;hip, that &s;oft Sentiment, or that warm Affection, which my charming <HI>Fanny</HI> is be&s;t capable of in&s;piring; my quick Sen&s;e of all which, I am proud to own, and grateful to acknowledge, I owe to her alone.</P>
<P>As to your leaving <HI>England,</HI> you may remem|ber, I told you before, that, though I might
<PB N="28" REF="29">
&s;ubmit, I never &s;hould con&s;ent; becau&s;e I could never &s;incerely do it. But upon this Subject I hope to have an Opportunity of &s;peaking more at large in a few Days, when I de&s;ign being in Town.</P>
<P>I do not remember the particular Conver|&s;ation, you hint at, ju&s;t before I left <HI>London.</HI> I am very certain, I never came into &s;uch an Agreement; and, if you propo&s;ed it, I have forgot it &mdash; as I &s;hould do every Thing, which betrayed the lea&s;t Unkindne&s;s in you.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;end this Night to the Po&s;t for your Letter, and am impatient to know how you are. I am afraid you &s;pent your Time, carele&s;s of your own Health, I may &s;ay, of my Health, while <HI>Kitty</HI> was in Town. I wi&s;h a little Scolding Would do you any Good.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t <HI>Fanny,</HI> I do not le&s;&s;en the Portion of Time allotted by Nature for Re&s;t. I find five Hours &s;ufficient for my Health and Spirits; more Sleep injures both; then rationally I con|clude, Nature meant no more. Now every Indulgence we take, beyond what Nature re|quires, is rather a Fatigue, than a Refre&s;hment. This is equally true in Meat, and Drink, and Sleep: And, to con&s;ider it in this Light, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pa&s;&s;age in Lord <HI>Grim&s;ton</HI>'s Play, which, along with the whole Performance, has been &s;o laughed at, is not quite &s;o ab&s;urd, as it is generally taken;
<Q>I'll re&s;t my wearied Bones, 'till they
<PB N="29" REF="30">
more wearied be.</Q>
I do not think, with you, that a Man is pa&s;&s;ively good, all the while he is a&s;leep; it would be great Favour to allow him to be even negatively bad. The Mind of Man was framed for a Series of rational Thought, and his Life de&s;igned for a Cour&s;e of moral Actions; if then, without Nece&s;&s;ity, he cea&s;es to think, or act, to the be&s;t of his Powers, he mars the Ends of his Creation. Nay, I think, we can hardly refrain from charging po&s;itive Guilt upon a Per&s;on, who &s;leeps more than he needs. Sleep is a temporary Death; and, as I hinted to you upon this Subject before, how a Man may lengthen his Life, he by this Means &s;hortens it, of cour&s;e; then, for &s;o much, he is guilty of Suicide. Is not a Man guilty of Theft, who &s;teals from an Heap, becau&s;e he does not pocket the Whole? And, if a Parcel of Money be laid in a Line upon a Table, is he not equally criminal, who takes from the Middle, as if he &s;tole from one End?</P>
<P>I have now gone through both your Letters, and, having nothing better or more agreeable to do, &s;hall return to <HI>Pliny</HI>; but &s;hall fir&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that I have had frequent Thought, &s;ince I was upon this Work, of writing Remarks upon your Letters,
<Q>and hold my Farthing-Candle to the Sun.</Q>
This would be an Undertaking, which would require a great deal, but not too much, Time; for, though your
<PB N="30" REF="31">
Letters are but few, yet the Comments would be many, either to point out the Beauties, or expre&s;s my Admiration of them.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth Epi&s;tle of the fifth Book is a very fine and a very affecting one. I love <HI>Pliny</HI> mo&s;t, when he &s;peaks upon &s;uch Subjects as the&s;e. His generous Friend&s;hips, extreme Tenderne&s;s, and exten&s;ive Humanity, have given me &s;uch an Affection for him, beyond any of the Antients I am acquainted with, that I am re&s;olved he &s;hall be the fir&s;t Per&s;on I will inquire for, when I go to Heaven; for there he is, if St. <HI>Paul</HI> be there. There may be many greater Characters, I mean with Regard to Hi&s;tory, but not one more amiable. How vain then is Ambition, when <HI>Pliny</HI> is preferred to <HI>Alexander,</HI> or <HI>Cae&s;ar!</HI> and how &s;urprizing, that Men &s;hould &s;till continue in a Mi&s;take, when &s;o little Re|flection may &s;et them right!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I never read with complete Plea&s;ure, but when we are together; &s;o it gives me Unea&s;ine&s;s, in my Mu&s;aeum, when any Senti|ment or Critici&s;m occurs to me, that I cannot immediately communicate it to you: And this
<PB N="31" REF="32">
is the Rea&s;on, that many of my Letters treat upon Subjects, which &s;eem not proper for &s;uch familiar Epi&s;tles, as our's generally are; &s;o that, perhaps, &s;ome of them appear &s;tiff merely from the Freedom of them; for I never &s;it down with a De&s;ign of writing you <HI>a Letter,</HI> but, when I take Pen in Hand, I write you whatever occurs to my Mind at that Time, whether Poetry, Metaphy&s;ics, Politics, or Divinity.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance, now, who could think of en|tertaining a young Woman of Wit, Gaiety, and poetic Rapture, with a Di&s;cour&s;e upon Self-Murder? But I happened this Morning to look into a Treati&s;e again&s;t Suicide, by Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> which I think a very in&s;ufficient Performance.</P>
<P>Authorities drawn from the Scriptures, or Writings of the Philo&s;ophers, may have Effect upon very weak or over religious Minds: But Rea&s;ons, not Authorities, are requi&s;ite to Men of Sen&s;e, or free Reflection; which a Man may have, without being an Athei&s;t, or merely a Dei&s;t.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e Places, where the Author attempts to rea&s;on, he does it very imperfectly; of which I &s;hall give you two In&s;tances, among many. He &s;ays,
<Q>We are placed here, like a Centinel at his Po&s;t,</Q>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and after going on, with a great deal of Common-place, on that Head, concludes, from the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> Analogy of human and divine Things, that Suicide mu&s;t be a
<PB N="32" REF="33">
Crime. But this is begging the Que&s;tion. What Authority from Rea&s;on have we to &s;ay, that Man is placed here, as a Centinel? Or, what Certainty have we of this Analogy? In Meta|phy&s;ics, indeed, we are obliged to give &s;ome Definitions of our Ideas, in order to help us to di&s;cour&s;e intelligibly about them; but, in Re|ality, there may be no more Relation between the Things them&s;elves, and our Ideas of them, than there is between Colours and Sounds; though a blind Man, to give us his Notion of Red, compared it to the Sound of a Trumpet, but yet, in true Philo&s;ophy, it comes as near the Sound of a Lute: And, indeed, the &s;pecu|lative Divines &s;eem to me, generally, to rea&s;on, like this Man, with more Fancy than Logic.</P>
<P>Another Piece of Rea&s;oning, he makes u&s;e of, is this:
<Q>That, though we cannot perceive any Relation, we are placed in, with Regard to this Life, (as in &s;ome In&s;tances may be the Ca&s;e) which might make our Death a moral Evil; yet, <HI>perhaps,</HI> we may be appointed by God to influence &s;ome future Event, and &s;o the Ends of Providence may be di&s;appointed by one Man's Impatience.</Q>
Now I think it extremely weak, perhaps impious, to imagine, that it can be in the Power of one Man, or Mankind united, to fru&s;trate the lea&s;t Scheme or De&s;ign of Providence: And a Thief, at the Gallows, may make u&s;e of &s;uch an Argument
<PB N="33" REF="34">
with as much Rea&s;on as any body el&s;e: So that this Rea&s;oning, by proving too much, proves nothing.</P>
<P><HI>Watts</HI> has, indeed, &s;ummed up all that has ever been &s;aid upon this Occa&s;ion; but, to tell the Truth, I never met with any thing &s;atisfactory upon the Subject; which is owing to the cautious, but unfair Manner of arguing, upon this Head, u&s;ed by the Divines; who, for Fear of giving the lea&s;t Encouragement to de&s;perate Men, will not admit of any Sort of Latitude in this Matter. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<P>ON finding that my dear <HI>Harry's</HI> Letter had been opened before it came to my Hands, I began to apprehend that my Letters might have been intercepted. I know not how this Treatment affects you; but it has filled me with the highe&s;t Re&s;entment: For &s;ure it is the Extreme of In&s;olence and Cruelty to deprive us of the only Means left to &s;often the tedious, me|lancholy Hours of Ab&s;ence: Nor can I believe that any Law, human or divine, has ve&s;ted even a Parent with &s;uch a Power.

I have often told you, that no Subject can appear dull or ab&s;tru&s;e to me, which you wrote on: Nay, I have gone farther, and &s;ome|times fancied, that if you were to write in a Language I was wholly unacquainted with, I &s;hould certainly under&s;tand you; at lea&s;t I am &s;ure I &s;hould, if I was to hear and &s;ee you &s;peak it.</P>
<P>I have never met with any of Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s Writings; but, from the Specimen you give, I take him to be a better Chri&s;tian than Philo|&s;opher. Though I am &s;ure there may be many &s;tronger Arguments again&s;t Suicide, than tho&s;e you quote from him, yet I am plea&s;ed at his
<PB N="35" REF="36">
con&s;idering every Individual, though without vi&s;ible Tye or Connection, as nece&s;&s;ary to the Well-being of the whole Species; for, as the Great Artificer made nothing in vain, the Wretch who finds not Happine&s;s in his own Bo&s;om, or in any outward Objects, may, from this Principle alone, conclude Self-Murder to be a Crime.</P>
<P>But, after all, what are all Arguments about this Matter? Only &s;peculative E&s;&s;ays: For I am convinced, that no Per&s;on ever committed the Act, but an Athei&s;t or a Madman. Then it would be in vain to rea&s;on with the fir&s;t, upon Principles which he denies you; and it would be a Je&s;t to rea&s;on with the other at all.</P>
<P>After this Reflection, I do not look upon Suicide in that &s;hocking Light which other People do: For, with Regard to the Athei&s;t, I fear it is pretty equal, to his poor Soul, after what Manner he dies; and, as to the Madman, I throw him upon his Mercy, who could, had he plea&s;ed, have
<Q>made Rea&s;on rule, and Pa&s;|&s;ion be it's Slave.</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXCII. <HI>HENRY</HI> to <HI>FRANCES.</HI></HEAD>
<P><GAP DESC="blank"></P>
<P><Q>I talked of dying; better Thoughts come forward;</Q>
and &s;ince the Satisfaction I have had in this Day has made me &s;omewhat more in Love with Life, I &s;hall here give you a Supplement to my la&s;t Letter, le&s;t you &s;hould imagine I was quite of a different Opinion from <HI>Watts,</HI> becau&s;e I did not allow his Rea&s;oning to be &s;ufficiently &s;trong upon the Subject.</P>
<P>I do not look upon Suicide, or indeed upon any Act, in the Light that Divines do, as cri|minal in it&s;elf; but regard all Actions, in a general View, as indifferent in them&s;elves; for the &s;ame Thing may be virtuous at one Time, and vicious at another: So that the Difference &s;eems to lie merely in Circum&s;tance. I think, with Deference to the Pulpit, that whoever un|der&s;tands the Nature of Vice in any other Sen&s;e, impiou&s;ly charges God with having originally generated Evil. Now, with Regard to this par|ticular In&s;tance we are upon, I con&s;ider a Suicide not as guilty of a particular Crime, but of &s;o
<PB N="37" REF="38">
much Vice, as the moral Con&s;equences of the Act leave him chargeable with: And the Chain is &s;o exten&s;ive, and the Dependencies &s;o nice, in this Life, that very few Men can be free enough, from Relation or Contingency, to be perfectly clear from Guilt in this Act: And, &s;o far as it is a Crime, it is of the highe&s;t Nature &s;o, as it has the Aggravation of Pre&s;umption, the Sin of acting again&s;t Nature, and the Im|po&s;&s;ibility of Repentance.</P>
<P>However there may be particular In&s;tances where the Thing may be indifferent in it&s;elf; yet, even here, though the Action be innocent, the Turn of Mind, which prompts to it, mu&s;t be extremely vicious. It argues an Impatience and Ra&s;hne&s;s, which are the Signs of an In|temperance of Soul, a Di&s;regard to the Opinion of this World, which every good Man &s;hould have Re&s;pect for, or a De&s;pair of God's Provi|dence, which a Man of Philo&s;ophy or Religion &s;hould never betray.</P>
<P>There are, I think, but three Things which can provoke a Per&s;on to this de&s;perate Act; Pain, Poverty, or Shame. If from the fir&s;t Cir|cum&s;tance, then he has forgot what all the Trials in this Life were intended for; and &s;o fooli&s;hly refu&s;es that Phy&s;ic, which may give him Health to Immortality. If from the &s;econd, it is owing to a fal&s;e Pride, and an unchri&s;tian Spirit, joined to a Habit of Idlene&s;s, which
<PB N="38" REF="39">
creates a &s;lothful De&s;pondency. If from the third, he but &s;eals his Name with Infamy, makes that Shame the more public, and de|prives him&s;elf of any Opportunity of retrieving his Character. It was finely &s;aid, by &s;ome great Man, upon hearing Libels had been wrote again&s;t him,
<Q>I will live &s;o, as to give the Lye to their Reproach.</Q></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a Criminal, leading forth to Execu|tion, even he &s;hall have no Power over his own Life, though already forfeited and condemned; for he adds to his Crime, by rebelling again&s;t the Laws of his Country, and deprives the Community of a whole&s;ome Example of public Ju&s;tice. Be&s;ide, as all human Inflictions may be con&s;idered as Trials of our Virtue, &s;o may even legal Puni&s;hments, if undergone with Re|&s;ignation, Contrition, and Hope, be con&s;idered as Attonements for our Crimes.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, that even in the mo&s;t indif|ferent Ca&s;e, though the Action it&s;elf may be morally innocent, yet it can never be performed but by a vicious Actor.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it is an Action contrary to the Laws of God and Man. The fir&s;t, without recurring to Authorities, may be proved from the natural Abhorrence we find in our&s;elves from the Act, which, to Demon&s;tration, &s;hews the Sen&s;e of Providence about the Matter: And the &s;econd we know from the general Sen&s;e of Mankind,
<PB N="39" REF="40">
who have endeavoured to deter from, by affixing Ignominy upon it, the only Way of dealing with the Dead.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e Reflections may not occur to a Man in the Hurry of the Act; for there are but few deliberate Suicides: Yet &s;urely any Moment of Time may afford us Lei&s;ure for this &s;hort Expo&s;tulation;
<Q>What if it &s;hould be a Crime? Then, great God, how &s;hocking mu&s;t his Si|tuation be, who&s;e Conviction comes too late for Repentance!</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXCIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your Letter la&s;t Po&s;t, with the Pamphlet wrote again&s;t the
<Q>E&s;&s;ay on Spirit.</Q>
I do not think it is well done; nor has he an&s;wered the E&s;&s;ay in any Sort to my Satisfaction. He &s;helters him&s;elf entirely under Texts of Scripture, which may be explained and under&s;tood as well for the E&s;&s;ay as him&s;elf. He does not venture into the Field at large, nor engage at all in the metaphy&s;ical Parts of that Work.</P>
<P>What does he mean by &s;aying, that
<Q>to &s;uppo&s;e the one only &s;elf-exi&s;ting God can
<PB N="40" REF="41">
delegate a Power of Creation, even to the highe&s;t Spirit, is impious and ab&s;urb?</Q>
It does not appear to me that there is any thing, in &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition, beyond the Power, or contrary to the Nature of God.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething new in his Opinion, that, by the Expre&s;&s;ion of the Angel of the Lord, is to be under&s;tood, not a di&s;tinct Spirit, but only the Form or Matter with which the Mo&s;t High has &s;ometimes indued him&s;elf, in order to be|come vi&s;ible to the Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of human Fa|culties. This may be true, for any thing that either he or I know: But I think there is no Authority for it in the Scriptures.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the three Men, who were &s;tiled Jehovah, and appeared to <HI>Lot,</HI> and from which he means to deduce a Hint of the Trinity in Unity, he gives a very un&s;atisfactory Rea&s;on why only two of them were &s;tiled Angels: And I &s;hall here venture upon a Sentiment of my own on this Head, which has ju&s;t now occurred to me. Two of the Per&s;ons are called Angels, intimating the Father and the Holy Gho&s;t; and the third is only &s;poken of as Man, prealluding to that State of Humanity, which God the Son was, thereafter, to take upon him&s;elf, in this World.&mdash;I think that this Pa&s;&s;age, thus ex|plained, greatly &s;trengthens the Allegory of that Apparition, &s;uppo&s;ed to manife&s;t to <HI>Abraham</HI> the Trinity in Unity.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">The In&s;incerity which he charges upon the Author, in the Dedication to the Primate, is, perhaps, true; but he unfairly pa&s;&s;es by, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was quoted for it, in giving Way, in &s;ome Things, to the Cu&s;toms of the Jews.</P>
<P>As to the "E&s;&s;ay on Spirit," my Objection is not to the Treati&s;e, but to the Author; for, as he confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be a Clergyman, he &s;hould have kept him&s;elf within the Trammels of his Garb; and, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome former Letter.</NOTE> as I &s;aid before, rather have go|verned him&s;elf by Form, than guided him&s;elf by Rea&s;on. The Church <HI>Catholicon,</HI> indeed, may be a proper Subject for human Di&s;qui&s;ition, and has, in former Times, been purged, modelled, and reformed, to the great Advantage of Chri&s;tianity: But the Church <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> is a &s;acred Thing; the Peace of it is not to be di&s;turbed, and Noli irritare is it's Motto. The Author is guilty of the &s;ame Officiou&s;ne&s;s of a Per&s;on that &s;hould rouze a Friend, dozing away his Life in a Lethargy; who would prefer peaceful Slumbers to the Vigour of Health, or the Length of Days. It had been a more pru|dent Attempt to have affirmed Athei&s;m, than Unithei&s;m; as Truth and Rea&s;on are more &s;afely combated, than Prejudice or Super&s;tition. It is the &s;ame Indi&s;cretion, as it would be in a State, for an enthu&s;ia&s;tic Patriot to venture his Life or Fortunes for the Sake of Liberty or
<PB N="42" REF="43">
Ju&s;tice. In &s;hort, Truth is no more to be &s;poken by all Per&s;ons, than at all Times.</P>
<P>For my Part, I think this E&s;&s;ay, though it has not immediately advanced the Principles of Chri&s;tian Morality, has had that great End ulti|mately in View, by &s;trengthening our Faith in the Hierarchy. Metaphy&s;ics are, in Truth, a dangerous Science to introduce into Religion; for, where there can be no Certainty, the Doubts mu&s;t be infinite. Natural Philo&s;ophy, with the rational Deductions therefrom, afford, to every contemplative Man, &s;ufficient Light to work his Salvation by: But &s;urely the &s;uper-metaphy&s;ical Doctrine, of Trinity in Unity, has made more Chri&s;tians recur to Dei&s;m, than Divines, perhaps, are aware of; while the Trinity, as explained in this E&s;&s;ay, &s;ufficiently vouched, I think, from the Scriptures, and the Opinions of the antient Fathers of the Church, who immediately followed the Apo&s;tles, has nothing anti-metaphy&s;ical in it: The Po&s;&s;ibility of it is comprehen&s;ible; and then, and then only, it becomes the proper Object of Faith.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ome enthu&s;ia&s;tic Believers, who are over zealous for My&s;teries, and think, that any thing, which falls &s;hort of Impo&s;&s;ibility, is not &s;ufficient Exerci&s;e for the Chri&s;tian Faith. Perhaps the&s;e Men are of that dangerous Sect, who affirmed, that perfect Faith alone was &s;uf|ficient to Salvation, and that the Doctrine of
<PB N="43" REF="44">
Good Works was impiou&s;ly pre&s;uming to add to the Merits of our Saviour; though the Apo&s;tle &s;ays,
<Q>Give all Diligence to add to your Faith Virtue.</Q>
2 <HI>Pet.</HI> i.5.</P>
<P>For my Part, I think that there is My&s;tery enough in the Incarnation, and Redemption, to &s;atisfy a rea&s;onable Man: And, as the&s;e Things are indeed incomprehen&s;ible, but not directly contrary to our Rea&s;on, they &s;quare, as I &s;aid before, with the allowed Definition of Faith.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the&s;e Remarks with an Al|lu&s;ion to the Body natural. That Con&s;titution is in Danger, who&s;e Appetite &s;wallows more than it's Stomach can dige&s;t; and the mo&s;t valid Health is always found to be with the mo&s;t temperate Man.</P>

<P><PB N="46" REF="47">In a Note upon the twenty-&s;eventh Epi&s;tle of the &s;eventh Book, we are informed of the Name of that Philo&s;opher, who gave the famous Advice to <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> to repeat the twenty-four Letters, whenever he found his Pa&s;&s;ion ri&s;ing. I wi&s;h I had &s;een this Pa&s;&s;age before the la&s;t Evening we &s;pent at &mdash;.

<P>In the Ob&s;ervations upon this &s;ame Epi&s;tle, Lord <HI>Orrery</HI> inveighs again&s;t the Weakne&s;s and Credulity, with Regard to Gho&s;ts and Appa|ritions. Now I cannot join with him in this Particular; becau&s;e there are &s;ome Stories of this Kind &s;o well atte&s;ted, that they &s;hould gain Credit, like other Parts of Hi&s;tory, upon the &s;ame Authority. The Belief of this Matter is
<PB N="47" REF="48">
a Thing above our Rea&s;on, but not contrary to it; which is the proper Definition of Faith: And, if it were made an Article of our Creed, I do not think it would be ami&s;s; for it is not contrary to Religion, as being vouched by Holy Writ: At lea&s;t, I would not di&s;courage the Belief, &s;ince it is a &s;trong Proof of Life, after Death; which every Argument that tends to prove, adds Strength to Religion and Virtue. As to the Immortality of the Soul, which I lay hold of every Opportunity to di&s;cour&s;e upon, it is a Thing, which a Chri&s;tian cannot doubt of; becau&s;e there is expre&s;s Authority for it in that Book, upon which his Faith is founded: And even to a Dei&s;t it may be proved, ex ab&s;urbo; which is a Method of arguing in the Mathe|matics, when the Truth of a Propo&s;ition cannot be demon&s;trated in a direct Manner, the A&s;&s;ent is gained, by &s;hewing the Ab&s;urdity of the con|trary Opinion: As thus; If there be no Here|after for Mankind, God is incon&s;i&s;tent, and unju&s;t; the fir&s;t, in giving us Hopes (which we certainly have from the Light of Nature alone) that are never to be fulfilled; and the &s;econd, in &s;uffering Virtue, in any Shape, to go unre|warded. That Being, then, which is incon|&s;i&s;tent, or unju&s;t, cannot be God; ergo, a Mortali&s;t Dei&s;t &s;inks into an Athei&s;t. I would treat an Athei&s;t after the &s;ame Manner that I mentioned ju&s;t now, and brand him with that
<PB N="48" REF="49">
pupil En&s;ign, which is the proper Emblem of his extreme Ignorance; for, as the P&s;almi&s;t ju&s;tly expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q>The <HI>Fool</HI> hath &s;aid in his Heart, there is no God.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Orrery,</HI> in the Notes upon the twenty-eighth Epi&s;tle, &s;ays, this Letter &s;hould be placed the fir&s;t of the whole Collection; and he is certainly right: Proper Lights, and particular Points of View, are a great Advantage to every thing. He often complains of the Want of Order through the Whole; and I am angry at him, for not &s;etting this Matter right; for it would be as little Trouble, as the Ob&s;erving upon it. I have a Mind to do &s;o my&s;elf, when I have fini&s;hed the Reading.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed with <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Sentiment upon Ridicule, in the la&s;t Paragraph of the twenty-ninth Epi&s;tle: And I approve of it as an ad|mirable Weapon again&s;t Vice; and &s;urely fitter here employed, than, as <HI>Shaft&s;bury</HI> recommends it, for the Te&s;t of Truth. Almo&s;t any Man would rather undergo Fine, Impri&s;onment, or Pain it&s;elf, rather than the Mortification of being laughed at. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> and other ingenious Writers, have &s;poken &s;o admirably upon the Power of Shame, or Influence of Mode&s;ty, that, for very Shame, I &s;hall not attempt to pur&s;ue the Subject in this Light; but &s;hall take the Liberty, for the Honour of human Nature, to
<PB N="49" REF="50">
con&s;ider this Matter in a particular Manner, which I never met with, in any Author.</P>
<P>Speech is not the di&s;tingui&s;hing Sign of an human Creature; for Birds have been taught to &s;peak: Nay, all the Brute, or Animal Creation conver&s;e naturally; for their Tones are intel|ligible to each other; and what are Words, but Sounds, and Expre&s;&s;ions of our Ideas? Ratio|nality is not the proper Sign neither; for In|&s;tinct makes that Matter doubtful; and it is certain, that all Animals act logically. Ri&s;i|bility is a Mark much in&s;i&s;ted upon; but, if this is meant merely of a Di&s;tortion of Countenance, I have &s;een Dogs laugh; and if it be meant as a Sign of Chearfulne&s;s, or Plea&s;ure, then the various Expre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e Sen&s;ations, through|out the whole Brute World, &s;ufficiently an&s;wer to this Definition. I look upon Mode&s;ty, then, to be the only Characteri&s;tic, or Criterion, which properly di&s;tingui&s;hes Man from other Animals; as we are certainly the only Creatures known, who have the lea&s;t Sen&s;e of Shame.</P>

<P>I SENT a &s;econd Me&s;&s;enger to the Po&s;t, &s;u&s;pecting the fir&s;t had deceived me; but not a Line from you, though you mu&s;t know how anxious I am, at pre&s;ent, to learn &s;ome Par|ticulars relating to your Situation.

<P>But to return to <HI>Pliny:</HI> I think <HI>Orrery</HI> too &s;evere upon the &s;econd Epi&s;tle of the eighth Book, not con&s;idering it as wrote to a Friend, and not to the World. The Privilege of Friend&s;hip is, to think aloud: And &s;hall I be reprimanded for communicating to my deare&s;t <HI>Fanny</HI> my humane Sentiments, with Regard to the Gleaner's Harve&s;t, <HI>&amp;c?</HI> Or, &s;hall I be thought ridiculous for telling you, that I have &s;pent good Part of this Morning in the Amu&s;e|ment of a <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor, catching Flies? not like <HI>Domitian,</HI> to kill them; but to retrieve them from their torpid State by the Heat of my Hand, and have the Joy to &s;ee them flutter
<PB N="51" REF="52">
about the Room with added Life and Vigour. I think it a wrong Thing, to di&s;courage, in any Sort, the Exerci&s;e of Humanity, even the Talking of it; as by this Means, perhaps, &s;ome People may be, as it were, intrapped into Virtue; by profe&s;&s;ing it fir&s;t out of Vanity, they may come afterwards to practi&s;e it out of Shame. Many a Coward has been induced to fight, becau&s;e he has happened to boa&s;t that he would.</P>
<P>In the twenty-&s;econd Epi&s;tle there is a very ju&s;t Sentiment, and a very proper one to be con&s;idered by the &s;evere Morali&s;t, or the out|rageou&s;ly Virtuous:
<Q>He, who hates Faults, hates Mankind.</Q></P>
<P>The twenty-third Epi&s;tle is a very affecting one, and the Character of <HI>Junius Avitus</HI> is very amiable. It is, indeed, the Nature of the Afflicted to enumerate every little Circum&s;tance, which once gave us Plea&s;ure in the Enjoyment of what we have lo&s;t; and it is &s;ometimes a mortifying Reflection, that, while we are multiplying our Joys, we may, perhaps, be but increa&s;ing the Earne&s;t of our Griefs.</P>
<P>In the &s;eventh Letter of the ninth Book, and &s;everal precedent ones, I find the Rea&s;on for Lord <HI>Orrery</HI>'s E&s;&s;ay upon antient Architecture, which, you may remember, I was a little alarmed about in his Preface to this Work; for which I here offer my Palinode.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53">On the eighth Epi&s;tle there is an In&s;tance of Wit in the Comment:
<Q>Vanity, like Smoke, &s;mothers and ob&s;cures the Flame, from whence it proceeds.</Q>
I have ob&s;erved a great deal of lively Fancy, as well as ju&s;t Thought, in my Lord's Writing, through the Cour&s;e of this Work: And, upon the Whole, I think he has &s;hewn him&s;elf a Man of Virtue, a Man of Learning, and a Man of Ta&s;te; and if he was not al&s;o a Man of Rank and Fortune, which might make my Attachment &s;u&s;pected by Per|&s;ons, who have none of the Qualities above|mentioned to ennoble their Sentiments, I would certainly take &s;ome &s;olicitous Pains to become acquainted with him.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t Paragraph of the Preface to the tenth Book, my Lord &s;eems in Doubt about the rendering the Word, <HI>Dominus</HI>; which he has done very ju&s;tly, by tran&s;lating it, <HI>Sir</HI>; as it is addre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Pliny</HI> to <HI>Trajan.</HI> It is in this Manner we &s;peak to our Kings; and the <HI>French,</HI> who are Patterns of all Politene&s;s and Decorum, &s;alute their Grand Monarque by the Stile of <HI>Sire.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-eighth Epi&s;tle of the tenth Book &s;hould immediately precede the thirtieth; be|cau&s;e, in this la&s;t, he refers to the former, in the&s;e Words:
<Q>I had informed you, by my la&s;t Letter, that <HI>Lycormas,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
I take e&s;pecial Notice of the Want of Order in this Particular,

becau&s;e my Lord has attempted to place all the Letters of this tenth and la&s;t Book in a regular Series; and, upon this Occa&s;ion, I &s;hall repeat what I &s;aid in a former Letter, Why did he not take the &s;ame Pains throughout?</P>
<P>In his thirtieth Epi&s;tle <HI>Pliny</HI> gives an ab&s;urd Rea&s;on for not detaining the Amba&s;&s;ador: He &s;ays, it was becau&s;e <HI>Lycormas</HI> had de&s;ired he &s;hould be detained, 'till he him&s;elf arrived.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXCVII.</HEAD>
<P>MY dear little Shrub, my Arbutus, my Ever-green, I wi&s;h you Joy of your Retirement, and happy Vacation from <GAP DESC="blank"></P>
<P>I am really charmed with your Rea&s;oning upon the Analogy between the finite Perfections and the divine Attributes, &s;o ju&s;tly deduced from
<PB N="54" REF="55">
the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of Providence; and am plea&s;ed, that I carried my Sentiments no farther upon that Subject, than merely to &s;ug|ge&s;t, that, <HI>perhaps,</HI> there might be no Relation between them: For, when I come clo&s;e to the Argument with the Divines, I enter the Li&s;ts upon their own Terms; but I only fix the Feet of <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Ladder on the Earth, while you &s;oar upon it to the Skies.</P>
<P>I meant to con&s;ider Mercy, as a &s;elf-&s;ufficient, di&s;tinct, operating Excellence in the Godhead; the proper Objects of which were tho&s;e, which did not come within the Merits of that Repen|tance, which might intitle them to the Ju&s;tice defined in that Letter. I am, my deare&s;t <HI>Fanny,</HI> well aware, how little orthodox I am in this Opinion; and therefore call upon my&s;elf for &s;ome Explanation of this Subject, as I &s;eem to make no Difference between the Good and Bad, with Regard to the unbounded Mercy of God. In order to which, I &s;hall make U&s;e of an Allu&s;ion, by con&s;idering Man in this Life, like a Silk-Worm in it's Nymph-State, involved and incompa&s;&s;ed round with Toils of their own weaving; the one waiting 'till God's Ble&s;&s;ing, as the other for a warm Sun, &s;hall re&s;cue him to a joyful Re&s;urrection. Now &s;ome In&s;ects carry the Seeds of Death with them into the Grave, and, con&s;equently, peri&s;h immediately, without being able to revive to a new Life;
<PB N="55" REF="56">
in which forlorn Situation I con&s;ider a wicked Man &mdash; and think I have &s;ome Authority from Scripture for this Hypothe&s;is.
<Q>The Wages of Sin are <HI>Death.</HI></Q>
And again,
<Q>The Lord wi&s;heth not the <HI>Death</HI> of a Sinner, but rather, that he may turn from his Wickedne&s;s, and <HI>live.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, though the Inflicting of Puni&s;hments, as I have &s;omewhere &s;aid, would, in &s;ome Sort, deprive Heaven of the full Enjoyment of it's own Perfection; yet &s;uch a literal Death, as I under&s;tand from the&s;e Texts, that is, the intire Deprivation of Sen&s;e or Being from a Sinner, is not only agreeable to Ju&s;tice, but to Mercy too; for
<Q>they &s;ay, bad Men would be unble&s;s'd in Heaven:</Q>
And as this Life is given us, in order to prepare our Souls for the Reli&s;h of that contemplative Bli&s;s, which is hereafter to be permitted to the Spirits of good Men made perfect, it would be rather an In&s;tance of Cruelty, than Mercy, to grant Immortality to tho&s;e unhappy Wretches, in a State of Exi&s;tence, which would not admit the Gratification of mortal Sen&s;es, or the Indulgence of human Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>As I am drawing toward the Conclu&s;ion of <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Works, I &s;hall fini&s;h my Remarks upon him, and his Tran&s;lator, in the Remander of this Letter.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57">In a Note upon the forty-&s;ixth Epi&s;tle, <HI>optimo Viro</HI> is called an Idiom, but I cannot &s;ee for what Rea&s;on: And my Lord might very well have rendered it literally, <HI>the be&s;t of Men,</HI> with|out appearing the lea&s;t &s;tiff in the Stile of that Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Trajan</HI>'s Speech, in the la&s;t Part of the Com|ment upon the fifty-fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, puts me in mind of a Humour of the Widow &mdash;, in this Country; who was &s;ome Time ago married, and the Morning after &s;he appeared capari&s;oned with an Hor&s;e-whip pinned to her Girdle; and told her Hu&s;band, &s;he meant always to wear it about her, that it might be ready, whenever &s;he de&s;erved his Cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixty-&s;eventh Epi&s;tle, read <HI>&s;ince,</HI> for <HI>&s;carce.</HI></P>
<P>I have gone through the re&s;t of this Book, which fini&s;hes the Volume, and find nothing more, fit to be remarked upon, that is not already taken Notice of by the Commentator, much better than I can pretend to do; and this, in general, is the Rea&s;on, why I have made &s;o few Ob&s;ervations upon the whole Work. As to the Freedom I have taken, in &s;ome Critici&s;ms, both with the Author, and his Commentator, I &s;hall excu&s;e my&s;elf with a Quotation out of the thirteenth Epi&s;tle of the third Book:
<Q>If I find you &s;o frank, as to make Objections to particular Pa&s;&s;ages, I &s;hall take
<PB N="57" REF="58">
it for granted, that you are plea&s;ed with all the re&s;t.</Q>
And &s;o indeed I am.</P>
<P>I think, the twentieth Epi&s;tle of the fourth Book would be proper to conclude the&s;e Remarks with; changing the Word <HI>Grief</HI> for <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> and applying that Letter to <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Orrery.</HI></P>
<P>And now let me a&s;&s;ure you, my dear <HI>Fanny,</HI> that I feel a real Concern, upon the Clo&s;e of this Work, at parting with three &s;uch Men, as <HI>Trajan, Pliny,</HI> and <HI>Orrery:</HI> But one I hope to know in this Life, and &s;hall die in Tru&s;t of meeting the others in the next; and you, my be&s;t-loved Girl, &s;hall know them too:
<Q>Together to the Realms of Bli&s;s well go.</Q>
'Till then, let us live, and love; for, while we do one, I am &s;ure we &s;hall do the other.</P>

<P>I AM almo&s;t angry with my &s;weet Love for not attributing his Di&s;appointment to any Cau&s;e, rather than my Neglect. I did indeed write, by <HI>Saturday</HI>'s Po&s;t, to Lady &mdash;, to <HI>Kitty,</HI> and to you. How extremely rude mu&s;t Lady &mdash; think me, as there is no Doubt but all my Letters mi&s;carried! I am va&s;tly unea&s;y about them, but particularly for her's, it being of mo&s;t Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>I join with you in thinking that Friend&s;hip not only allows the Privilege of communicating our inmo&s;t Thoughts, and of acknowledging the hone&s;t Pride we feel from the Exerci&s;e of any moral Virtue, but that it is a Breach of that noble Intercour&s;e to conceal even our Faults or Foibles. For my Part, I have &s;hewn my Heart as naked to thy View, as to the Eye of Heaven. Real Friend&s;hip, like true Love, is under&s;tood by very few, yet common in the Mouths of every one. It can only be conceived by Minds capable of the mo&s;t refined and di&s;intere&s;ted Sentiments:
<Q>Re&s;erve will wound it, and Di&s;tru&s;t de&s;troy;</Q>
and this makes
<Q>Friends &s;uch Rarities below.</Q>
I think, that Per&s;ons of different Sexes, who, with a tolerable Under|&s;tanding, have had a &s;incere Affection for each other, are mo&s;t likely to be capable of real
<PB N="62" REF="63">
Friend&s;hip; for even the Remains of Love will create a Gentlene&s;s in our Manners, and Complacency of Behaviour; the Want of which is too often the Effect and Bane of common Friend&s;hips. I declare &s;olemnly, I have felt a higher Satisfaction in con&s;idering my&s;elf as your fir&s;t Friend, than ever I did in thinking my&s;elf the Object of your Affection. I know my&s;elf capable of retaining your E&s;teem, becau&s;e I will never do any Thing to forfeit it; and therefore I receive greater Plea&s;ure from any Mark of your Confidence, than from the fonde&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of your Love &mdash; Not but I &s;hall ever wi&s;h to pre|&s;erve that too, as I have paid the Price for it, by giving mine; but we are, in general, fonder of what we have no Right to, than what is ju&s;tly our's.</P>
<P>There is no Part of your Character &s;o much indears you to me, as the Tenderne&s;s and Humanity of your Di&s;po&s;ition. I have actually felt the &s;ame Tran&s;port in thinking of it, as you have done in the Exerci&s;e; my Heart has trembled, and Eyes overflowed with Plea&s;ure, as if I had done &s;ome generous or humane Act my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I do a&s;&s;ure you, that often in the extreme Fondne&s;s of my Heart, when I have looked at, and heard you with the &s;incere&s;t Delight, I have been ready to bur&s;t into Tears, from reflecting that the Happine&s;s, I then enjoyed, might &s;ome

<P>I think there is &s;omething very pretty in your Sentiments about Friend&s;hip. You have carried the Thought farther, than I had ever con&s;idered it, by &s;aying, even our Faults, or Foibles, we
<PB N="65" REF="66">
&s;hould not hide, in &s;uch an Intercour&s;e; but I think there is even a certain Hone&s;ty in &s;uch an open Dealing; for Friend&s;hip, &s;uch as de&s;erves that Name, is an Union for Life; and, as in the meaner Partner&s;hips of Trade, we &s;hould reveal the Drawbacks of Debts, or In&s;ufficiencies upon our Stock, how much more nice ought we to be in this noble and generous Society! I think, with you, that Per&s;ons of different Sexes are mo&s;t likely to pre&s;erve the be&s;t, and mo&s;t la&s;ting Friend&s;hips; and really believe, that, in the very few Marriage States, which can be deemed happy, the mo&s;t perfect Concords of this Kind are to be found. That Gentlene&s;s of Manners, and Complacency of Behaviour, which you mention, may be con&s;idered as the E&s;&s;ence of Virtue, rather than the mere Orna|ment of it; and the <HI>French</HI> Writers treat of them in this pretty Light, under the Title of "Les petites Morales." If &s;trict Philo&s;ophy will not admit of this Expre&s;&s;ion, they may cer|tainly be allowed the Marks of the mo&s;t amiable Virtues; as they are &s;ure Signs of Good-nature, Humility, and Humanity. As &s;ome of the Sages &s;aid, that Virtue need but put on a vi&s;ible Form, to bewitch Mankind with her Charms, I think, that, what is meant by the Term, Good-breed|ing, mu&s;t certainly be the Dre&s;s, &s;he would ap|pear in. Mere naked Virtue, perhaps, may be a fit Contemplation for an Angel; but &s;he mu&s;t
<PB N="66" REF="67">
be cloathed, with Decency, to be admired by Man. A ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, as it has no
<Q>Sen&s;e to ake,</Q>
can bear the tran&s;cendent Splendor of Truth; but her Glory is too dazzling for the human Mind to bear without a Veil; as we look at the Sun through a &s;moaked Gla&s;s, and are obliged to u&s;e Shades, to mark the Beauties of Proportion.</P>
<P>Upon this Occa&s;ion, has happily occurred to me, Part of the mo&s;t noble De&s;criptions of the State of the Ble&s;&s;ed, that can be conceived; though it was imagined, by an unenlightened Heathen, <HI>Plotinus,</HI> a Philo&s;opher of the <HI>Platonic</HI> Sect. A Tran&s;lation will &s;erve you, as well as the Original.</P>
<P><Q>In Heaven, the ble&s;&s;ed Inhabitants enjoy a happy Tranquillity, having Truth it&s;elf for the Author of their Being, for their E&s;&s;ence and Support. They &s;ee Things there, not only as they are produced, but contemplate them in their fir&s;t Principles, and behold them&s;elves in tho&s;e about them; for there all Things are obvious and per&s;picuous, nothing ob&s;cure, nothing oppo&s;ite: All is con&s;picuous to all, intrin&s;ical throughout; for Light every-where blends with Light: Every one has every thing in him&s;elf, and beholds the &s;ame in others: All Things then are every-where, and immen&s;e Splendor &s;hines through all: Motion there is perfectly pure; for one Mo|tion
<PB N="67" REF="68">
does not impede another: Re&s;t al&s;o there is never di&s;turbed by Change; for it is not blended with un&s;table Nature: There dwells Beauty in the Ab&s;tract, independent of Form, or Matter. We may farther pre&s;ume, that tho&s;e, who behold the&s;e Things, can never be fatigued in the Contemplation of them; nor can any Satiety occur, to occa&s;ion any Fatigue; for there will be no Emptine&s;s in any one, which, by being filled and &s;a|tiated, may put an End to their Enjoyment.</Q></P>
<P>I have here given you the Sen&s;e of this beau|tiful Pa&s;&s;age; though, I am afraid, I have but poorly imitated the Spirit of it. The whole Author is extremely fine; and this is but a very &s;mall Part of the great De&s;cription, he has &s;o gloriou&s;ly attempted; but it was all, which fairly occurred to me upon the Subject of this Letter, and, as I thought, had &s;ome Relation to it. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<P>I can, no more than you, determine, whether it is kind, or cruel, to prolong the Life of your little Favourite. What does it &s;ub&s;i&s;t on, during the Time of it's natural Exi&s;tence? If you know, and can provide it with natural Su&s;te|nance, we may &s;uppo&s;e it dies only for Want of the Sun's Heat; then, to revive it with an artificial Warmth cannot be Cruelty: But if it's Food, as I believe, be of the Summer's Pride, and is not now to be found in the vegetable World, I fear the poor little In&s;ect &s;uffers by your Fondne&s;s, as Annihilation is preferable to Mi&s;ery. Be&s;ides, I fancy a Butterfly does not die; but, according to the <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Sy&s;tem, changes it's Form, and Being. This I am not quite clear in; though I have met with &s;ome poetical Simile, that warrants this Opinion.</P>
<P>To con&s;ider our pre&s;ent State of Exi&s;tence, as rational Beings, who hope for a glorious Im|mortality, it mu&s;t appear the highe&s;t Act of Folly to aim at lengthening it, even for a Mo|ment: It is as ab&s;urd, as to &s;uppo&s;e a Pri&s;oner &s;hould de&s;ire to continue in a Dungeon, when he may have Liberty to quit it, and enjoy all the Delights of Life; Yet were there any

<P>YOU may &s;ee, by my Paper, that I am not at home, and con&s;equently have not your la&s;t Letter with me, to an&s;wer; therefore you can expect no other Rea&s;on for my writing to you now, but to &s;hew you I would not neglect it, even for one Po&s;t, though unprepared with my be&s;t Help, your Love-in&s;piring, Sen&s;e-inditing Epi&s;tles.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="blank"> dined with me To-day, and hurried me home with them this Evening. I would have excu&s;ed my&s;elf, but that I avoid the Appearance of any thing which looks queer; and I am apt to &s;u&s;pect, that a Per&s;on has but the Appearance of Sen&s;e, Courage, or Philo&s;ophy, who affects to manife&s;t them upon trifling Occa&s;ions. I declare that I have, of late, &s;o entirely given my&s;elf up to the charming Plea&s;ures of Solitude, that I begin to endure Company, as one plays a bad Hand of Cards, not for the Enjoyment of the Sport, but merely to keep one's Self within the Game. This Turn of Mind has &s;ometimes &s;o alarmed me, that I have argued the Point with my&s;elf, pro and con; but have declared for the Plea&s;ures of retired and philo&s;ophic Lei&s;ure, upon this
<PB N="72" REF="73">
Rea&s;oning, that it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome Accident or Misfortune of Life may hereafter deprive me of the Enjoyment of Society; for few and rare Friends are found at the Poor, the Sick, or the Pri&s;oner's Levee; but Death alone can rob me of the Heart-approving, rational Joys of Soli|tude. If I quitted the <HI>Conver&s;e</HI> of the World out of an Au&s;terene&s;s of Manners, or a Severity of Morals, I might ju&s;tly appear in the uncouth and unphilo&s;ophic Light of a Mi&s;anthrope; but when I retire, in order to prepare my&s;elf for a <HI>better,</HI> I &s;eem to my&s;elf to act the Part of one, who takes a larger Scope in view, than the &s;canty Horizon of this narrow Globe. I retire, to conver&s;e with you, and to make A&s;&s;ignations with thee, my charming Seraph, where I &s;hall have Myriads of unjealous Rivals in thy Love, in the Harmony of thy Sen&s;e and Virtue. It is you alone, who can make me endure Society; as it was you only, who have in&s;pired me with tho&s;e Helps, which can enable me to live alone. You need not be apprehen&s;ive, that &s;uch ab|&s;tracted Speculations, as the&s;e, can ever abate the Warmth of my Affection to you; for what is my Love to my deare&s;t <HI>Fanny,</HI> but that <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> for Virtue, which I hinted at, in a former Letter, and that high Admiration for Beauty, Harmony, and Order, which is the proper Contemplation of the truly philo&s;ophic Mind?

<P>THE Dependence, you expre&s;s, upon my doing every thing for our mutual Happi|ne&s;s, was not nece&s;&s;ary to encourage me to do &s;o, upon all Occa&s;ions; but, if I needed any Inducement, that Confidence alone would be &s;ufficient to oblige me to it; and I &s;hall never attempt to over-rule your Will, but to better inform it; or the more effectually to an&s;wer the great End of all my Thoughts and Actions, namely, your Happine&s;s and E&s;tabli&s;hment, and my own, only through &s;uch charming Means.

I talked of his Approach, as a Thing expected, but not feared: If I betrayed any Weakne&s;s, it mu&s;t have been from the Thoughts of parting with you, not Life; for indeed I have as little Rea&s;on to be fond of a painful Exi&s;tence, as you have to be "di&s;plea&s;ed and di&s;obliged," at my being concerned for our pre&s;ent or future Sepa|ration. I am of Opinion, that it is Strength of Body, not Mind, I want, to render me agreeable to you: If I were a Foot taller, and propor|tionably robu&s;t, I &s;hould be a cleverer Per&s;on than I am; but &s;ince
<Q>we cannot, by taking Thought, add one Cubit to our Stature,</Q>
it is in vain to complain of my &s;mall Size, or Want of Strength or Spirits.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not mention your Coming any more. I have already &s;poke my Sentiments. Your own Di&s;cretion be your Guide.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Stoic! May I, if I live, be able to acquire the Strength, you wi&s;h me po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of! or may you, in &s;ome Degree, become

<P>I SEND you Mr. <HI>Lyttelton</HI>'s Monody, which I am charmed with, though I think there appears more Poetry than Love in it: Not that the Grief is not <HI>well,</HI> but that it is too well ex|pre&s;&s;ed; which a Per&s;on who really felt could not, perhaps, &s;o aptly de&s;cribe: And methinks I perceive more of the Poet's Art, than of the Mourner's Sorrow.</P>
<P>If, indeed, he be truly &s;incere, I declare, that I would rather have Mr. <HI>Lyttelton</HI> my Widower, than be the Wife of any other Man in the World, except your&s;elf: For then I &s;hould have had the highe&s;t Happine&s;s this World can boa&s;t of, the being beloved and e&s;teemed by a Man of Sen&s;e, Ta&s;te, and Virtue; the Merit of which mu&s;t in&s;ure the Happine&s;s of the next, which, if higher than that, ri&s;es above the Power of human Wi&s;h to de&s;ire, or of human Wit to conceive.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXIV. <HI>HENRY</HI> to <HI>FRANCES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I RECEIVED the Monody, and am as much charmed with it as you are; but I could not help &s;miling at your jealous Critici&s;m. I do not look upon the Poem in the Light that you do; for it affected me in a higher Concern, that it was po&s;&s;ible for your Death to in&s;pire me with every Sentiment of Grief there expre&s;&s;ed, without the Poetry to publi&s;h them to the World.</P>
<P>To a Per&s;on u&s;ed to read and write Poetry, Figures, Allu&s;ions, and Numbers are as familiar, as plain Pro&s;e is to other People:
<Q>&mdash;For the Numbers came.</Q></P>
<P>Poets have generally pleaded their Incapacity, on Account of Grief; but this was always in
<PB N="90" REF="91">
order to rai&s;e the Merit of the Poem. <HI>Tickel</HI> &s;ays,
<Q><L>Grief unaffected &s;uits but ill with Art,</L>
<L>And flowing Numbers with a broken Heart.</L></Q>
However, he has contrived to &s;igh out as beautiful an Elegy, as ever was written in any Language.</P>
<P><HI>Waller</HI> &s;aid, that Poets excel only in Fiction; but this was rather an ingenious Apology for writing better on <HI>Cromwell</HI> than on <HI>Charles:</HI> It had more of Wit than Critici&s;m in it; or, if there was any thing of the latter, it mu&s;t be true only of Heroic Poetry; becau&s;e neither the Actions, Virtues, or real Characters of Men are high enough to adorn the Epic Ver&s;e.</P>
<P>But there is a Mixture of Tenderne&s;s and Dignity, which form the Characteri&s;tic of Elegy, that agrees perfectly well with Figures, which it naturally in&s;pires; and the more &s;incere the Grief, the bolder will the&s;e be of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>There is one Authority, which puts an End to any further Critici&s;m upon this Subject. <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>If you would make me weep, you mu&s;t fir&s;t drop Tears your&s;elf:</Q>
Which &s;hews, that the Beauty of Elegy mu&s;t ri&s;e in Proportion to the Sincerity of the Mourner.</P>
<P>I remember the elder <HI>Palma,</HI> who&s;e Ta&s;te in Mu&s;ic I was fond of, &s;at down, one Day, to compo&s;e &s;omething for me; perhaps I was in Love at that Time, for I de&s;ired he would make
<PB N="91" REF="92">
it expre&s;&s;ive of the mo&s;t melting Tenderne&s;s: Upon which he replied, "Il faut pleurer donc;" and, as the <HI>Italians</HI> have their Pa&s;&s;ions at Will, he began to &s;igh, and actually wrought him&s;elf up to a Flow of Tears, while he was writing.</P>
<P>But I might have &s;aved you the Trouble of all this Critici&s;m, only by referring you to Mr. <HI>Lyt|telton</HI>'s Character; who is far from being &s;o flight a Man, as to <HI>play</HI> the Poet upon &s;o &s;erious and affecting a Subject: And there is one Particular, which proves to me his Sincerity beyond all Doubt; which is, that, among a great Choice and Variety of his truly cla&s;&s;ical and poetic Writings, this Poem is, I think, the Chef d'Oeuvre.</P>
<P>All the Fault I find with Mr. <HI>Lyttelton,</HI> is, that he did not under-write him&s;elf upon this Occa&s;ion; for there is a certain gallant Pride in an ingenuous Nature, which tempts it to fall &s;hort even of the Prai&s;e it thinks is due, and is willing to be&s;tow, le&s;t it &s;hould be mi&s;taken for Adulation. However, there is, at the &s;ame Time, a certain Fondne&s;s in the Lover, which inclines him to give Immortality to the Object of his Pa&s;&s;ion, which is not to be hoped for, without an Exertion of the fulle&s;t Powers of Poe&s;y.</P>
<P>I pity a Poet's Grief more than any other Man's; for his natural Warmth, Tenderne&s;s of Sentiment, and Liveline&s;s of Imagination, give
<PB N="92" REF="93">
Sorrow a Power of &s;inking deeper in his Heart, than others can po&s;&s;ibly be affected with. When a plain Man lo&s;es a Mi&s;tre&s;s, Wife, Child, or Friend, he laments merely for the Lo&s;s of &s;o much Property: But, when the&s;e dear Con|nections are torn off from a Per&s;on of a delicate Ta&s;te, he feels as if he had lo&s;t Part of him&s;elf, <HI>Animae Dimidium</HI> &mdash; nay wor&s;e, for the Remain|der is a Burden to him.</P>
<P>Your Criterion I will not admit of; for a Man, who is &s;incere in his Grief for the Lo&s;s of a Wife, is the more likely to marry again. When Plea&s;ures are flown, Nature &s;trongly &s;olicits the Recovery of them: The cha&s;te nuptial Joys engro&s;s the whole Man, and form his Ta&s;te and Sentiments entirely to &s;uch &s;ocial Enjoyments, which, by fond Indulgence, become at la&s;t his &s;ole Scheme of Happine&s;s; and when tho&s;e charming Ties are di&s;&s;olved, he has the World, as it were, to begin anew; and it is &s;urely then more natural, and more rational too, to endeavour to renew the Plea&s;ures we have been &s;o well acquainted with, and approved of, than to attempt a &s;piritle&s;s Succedaneum to them.</P>
<P>So that, if ever your <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> &s;hould come to pa&s;s, we ought not to doubt his Sincerity to the la&s;t Wife, but rather &s;ay, that he had paid a very high Compliment to his future one.</P>

<P>THE Heat of the Day, and the Coolne&s;s of my unperforming Nag, obliged me to &s;top here to Dinner. When the Sun's Strength declines, and my Hor&s;e recovers his, I &s;hall make a de&s;perate Pu&s;h for St. <HI>Alban's.</HI></P>
<P>Among the Parcel of loo&s;e Papers, which I put into my Pocket, for Amu&s;ement on the Road, I find the inclo&s;ed Letter from <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> to his Wife; which I &s;end you, as Part of a Comment upon <HI>Hudibras</HI>; which I left you reading. You may ob&s;erve, from this Letter, the hypocritical and fanatic Stile of the leading Men at that Aera, which will give you Light into the Characters of Knight and 'Squire.</P>
<P>Though it is but three Hours &s;ince we parted, I found I could not eat my Dinner without writing to you; for my Love is &s;tronger than my Hunger. The Eagerne&s;s of Appetite &s;ome|times makes me omit a Grace, and Sleep too often inclines me to neglect a Prayer at Night; but at Bed, or Board, I never forget to think of you, or cea&s;e to wi&s;h you, mo&s;t earne&s;tly, a Participation of &s;uch Entertainment, as I can afford you at either.</P>

in &s;uch a Condition,
<Q>as is her Cu&s;tom always in the Afternoon.</Q></P>
<P>There is &s;omething remarkably odious in this Vice in Women, as Cu&s;tom and Education are again&s;t it, and that it has not even the Excu&s;e of Nature or Temptation on it's Side.
<Q><L>When Women err, let Nature be their Guide;</L>
<L>Love has &s;ome &s;oft Excu&s;e for female Pride.</L></Q>
For my Part, I &s;hould think the Embraces of a Harlot cha&s;ter than the Fondne&s;s of &s;uch a Wife.</P>
<P>What a &s;hocking Thing mu&s;t it be to any Woman's Reflection, at a &s;ober Interval, to think, that, by this Vice, &s;he has rendered her&s;elf the Subject of Lu&s;t, without being the Object of De&s;ire! For &s;uch mu&s;t be the Con|&s;equence, when Pa&s;&s;ions are inflamed, while Rea&s;on is extinct, and, as the Wife of <HI>Bath</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>There is a Rule I never knew to fail, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
And what a dreadful Situation mu&s;t that unhappy Man be in, who thinks he has no Security over his Wife's Cha&s;tity, but the natural Abhorrence which her Vice creates! For, in &s;uch a State, one could only think her a fit Paramour for an Incubus, which is a Species of Daemon, that is reported to hold criminal Commerce with dead Bodies.

<DIV1 TYPE="document">
<P>AS my Marriage, which I hereby publi&s;h, which I have privately owned to &s;ome Friends already, and which I hope, long before the&s;e Seals &s;hall be broke open, I &s;hall find my&s;elf at Liberty to acknowledge to all the World, may &s;urprize &s;ome of my Relations and Friends, to whom I would, living or dying, give Satis|faction in any Particular relating to my&s;elf, I &s;hall leave this Declaration behind me for their Peru&s;al.</P>
<P>I was not over-reached into this Match by Art, nor hurried into it by Pa&s;&s;ion; but, from long Experience of her Sen&s;e and Worth, I rea&s;oned my&s;elf into it: And that I have not had any Cau&s;e to change my Opinion &s;ince, may be &s;een by my leaving this Writing un|cancelled at my Death.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="98">I con&s;idered, that there were three Things nece&s;&s;ary in a Wife, which the World or my&s;elf &s;hould approve; Money, to accommodate my Fortunes; &mdash; Birth, to &s;atisfy the Pride of my Relations; &mdash; and Sen&s;e, to render my own Life happy.</P>
<P>I con&s;idered, that it was an extraordinary Chance for one Man to compa&s;s all three; any one of which being as much good Luck as generally falls to one Man's Share, and the la&s;t the mo&s;t &s;eldom: There was, then, no Di&s;pute which of them I &s;hould prefer, con&s;idering that I was, at that Time, thirty-&s;ix Years of Age, and that
<Q>a Man, who is born of a Woman, has but a &s;hort Time to live,</Q>
and a much &s;horter to be happy.</P>
<P>I con&s;idered, that I had formed my own Mind, and made my own Fortune too, having never had Tutor or Patron to either; and that my Friends ought &s;urely to give me Leave to frame my own Happine&s;s too.</P>
<P>I found I had &s;o engaged her Affections, that no other Man could make her happy; and &s;o dallied with her Character, that only my&s;elf could repair it. Thus Honour, Ju&s;tice, and Genero&s;ity concurred to what my Love and Rea&s;on had before approved.</P>
<P>The Progre&s;s of our Loves may be &s;een in a Collection of our Letters, which are, at pre&s;ent, in the Hands of a Friend; and, in reading them,

<P>INDEED, my <HI>Harry,</HI> I wi&s;h to live for no other Rea&s;on, but to make you amends for all your Goodne&s;s to me: God grant my Power may be in any Proportion equal to my Will, and we &s;hall be the happie&s;t Couple breathing: And, indeed, I think I may, without Vanity, &s;ay, I know no two Per&s;ons, who &s;eem better qualified for &s;uch a State, than we are; and therefore we mu&s;t be thoroughly mi&s;erable, if we are not entirely happy; for both our Feelings and Sentiments are too delicate and refined, to be capable of that Indifference, which the generality of Mortals pa&s;s their Lives in. For which Rea&s;on, I am not di&s;plea&s;ed that your Situation and Circum&s;tances prevented our living together, before I was thoroughly acquainted
<PB N="102" REF="103">
with you, or my&s;elf; but, though I think I might now &s;afely an&s;wer for my future Conduct, I own my mo&s;t fervent Wi&s;hes are &s;ometimes damped with fearing, that, if ever we &s;hould live together, you may grow weary of me, or, as <HI>Milton</HI> phra&s;es it,
<Q>Too much Conver&s;e thee perhaps may &s;atiate.</Q>
However, I more often lament the &s;ad Nece&s;&s;ity which parts us; and I think you more to be pitied in this Separation, even than I am, &s;up|po&s;ing our Love to be quite equal.

This Subject, which you too often enter upon, always alarms me; for, if ever I &s;hould love you le&s;s, it mu&s;t be owing to your&s;elf. I a&s;&s;ure you, that it never once enters into my Head, but when you mention it; and, upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, I naturally reflect upon every Circum&s;tance, in our pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and future Lives, which might po&s;&s;ibly effect &s;uch a Change; which is, by no Means, a healthful Contemplation. On the contrary, when my Thoughts and Reflections are left to my own Guidance, I direct them to your Conver&s;ation,
<PB N="104" REF="105">
to your Letters, to your Kindne&s;s to, and Con|fidence in me: I compare you to any other Woman, and, taking you all in all, give you your Advantage.

I have taken a great deal of Pains, well re|warded, to gain your Love; but have taken a great deal more to teach you how to pre&s;erve mine. That my Happine&s;s depended upon it, was not &s;o &s;trong a Rea&s;on to me, as that I be|lieved yours re&s;ted upon the &s;ame Foundation: And I have been always more your Friend than your Lover; not by exerting the fir&s;t Character, which my Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on &s;ufficiently inclined me to; but by re&s;training the latter, which my Heart &s;o &s;trongly impelled me to: And my be&s;t Love, my fir&s;t, my la&s;t, my only Love, &s;hall always find the Exerci&s;e of both the&s;e Characters exerted toward her, while there is one Quality in her charming Compo&s;ition, which can be the proper Subject of either; or, rather, &s;he is very near being that clever Creature, which is ca|pable of happily blending both the&s;e Affections in one; for which nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary, but to u&s;e that Under&s;tanding, upon all Occa|&s;ions,

<P><HI>P.

I did &s;o; and, as he has ju&s;t done with it, I &s;end you the Original inclo&s;ed.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your religious Exhortation, and brotherly Admonition, which I mu&s;t ac|knowledge
<PB N="106" REF="107">
to be in the Stile of a Prie&s;t, but not in the Spirit of a Chri&s;tian; both for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, that it &s;o boldly and ignorantly denounces Damnation again&s;t tho&s;e, who differ from you in controverted Opinions and Forms, even though, in E&s;&s;entials, you &s;hould both agree; as if the God of the Univer&s;e was but a King of one Nation of Men, and declared War again&s;t all tho&s;e, who refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the &s;ame Policy. This I &s;peak, in general, with Regard to the uncharitable Sentiments of the whole Body of Chri&s;tians, again&s;t the Profe&s;&s;ors of every other Wor&s;hip, in the re&s;t of the World. But, as to the Points in Que&s;tion between you and me, let me fairly &s;tate the Ca&s;e between us.</P>
<P>We believe and adore the &s;ame God, and have the &s;ame Faith in the Trinity: We al&s;o ob&s;erve the &s;ame Principles of Morality, hinted fir&s;t to the antient Philo&s;ophers by the Light of Rea&s;on, and afterwards more fully illu&s;trated, and made obvious to the meaner Capacities, by the divine Grace of Revelation. We both de|rive our Doctrines from the &s;ame Text of Holy Writ, and are, therefore, both of the one only true and univer&s;al Church.</P>
<P>The only Difference, then, between us, is, that in the Infancy of Chri&s;tianity, making it's Way through the Errors of Judai&s;m and Heatheni&s;m, it nece&s;&s;arily contracted a great
<PB N="107" REF="108">
deal of the Foulne&s;s of Super&s;tition in it's Pa&s;|&s;age, and grew up incumbered with many idle Forms, and u&s;ele&s;s and ab&s;urd Ceremonies, which are by no Means authorized from Scrip|ture. There was likewi&s;e a good deal of Time|&s;erving in the fir&s;t Preachers after the Apo&s;tles; for they were but Men, and the Grace of In|&s;piration cea&s;ed with the Apo&s;tles. The&s;e Men, then, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to propagate this new Faith, pure and intire, again&s;t the &s;uper&s;titious Prejudices of antient and e&s;tabli&s;hed Modes of Wor&s;hip, at lea&s;t with that Di&s;patch which their Zeal required, temporized with the Cere|monies and Idolatries of the Nations round them, in order to be the better received among them. They thought, perhaps, that, as this Religion was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Power of Miracles, it mu&s;t be maintained &s;o; and then introduced that ab&s;urd and unphilo&s;ophical Doctrine of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. They thought too, that to give Men Hopes of a Redemption, even after Death, and by the Merit of another's Devotion, would naturally allure them to the Embracing this new Faith; and &s;o publi&s;hed the Doctrine of Supererogation, which unluckily contradicts another, broached at the &s;ame Time, of Purgatory, in the mo&s;t expre&s;s Manner; as the la&s;t &s;uppo&s;es, that no Per&s;on can be virtuous or religious enough to &s;ave his Soul intire, before he dies, therefore mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s
<PB N="108" REF="109">
through a Purgation; and the other &s;uppo&s;es, that a Man may not only perform &s;ufficient Acts to &s;ecure him&s;elf, but the Overplus of his Merits may go toward the Salvation of another. This Contradiction puts me in Mind of the old &s;aying, that
<Q>Lyars &s;hould have good Me|mories.</Q>
Now you are drinking from the polluted Stream, while we have recurred up to the pure Fountain, and original Source. Our Religion is deduced from the plain Text of the Scriptures, your's from the &s;ophi&s;tical Comments of the Prie&s;ts. When a Prie&s;t once a&s;ked a Prote&s;tant, where his Religion was before <HI>Luther,</HI> he an&s;wered humourou&s;ly, but not le&s;s ju&s;tly, by a&s;king him, where was his Face before it was wa&s;hed?</P>
<P>As for your Doctrine of &s;even Sacraments, which you &s;ay we are deficient in, I an&s;wer, that we receive the E&s;&s;ence of them all in our two; and the fewer Heads any Propo&s;ition is divided into, the le&s;s Confu&s;ion there will be in the Comprehen&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, you &s;eem to have more of the Sub|tilties of the Schools, in your Rea&s;oning, than the Purity of Religion, which, the more &s;imple it is, is the more divine.</P>
<P>What you &s;ay, with Regard to the Saints, Martyrs, Virgins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is not only Idolatry, in general, but that particular Species of it imbibed by the Church with it's Nur&s;e's Milk; for the
<PB N="109" REF="110">
a&s;&s;igning &s;eparate Charges to them, over Na|tions, Trades, Di&s;tempers, Perils by Land and Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is the &s;ame Error among <HI>Roman</HI> Catholics, which Theologicians attribute to the Heathen <HI>Romans,</HI> who are &s;aid to have wor|&s;hipped the only true God, but mi&s;took every Attribute for a di&s;tinct Deity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall trouble you no farther now, upon the&s;e Subjects; but conclude, that, if Religion be your Trade, I would have you &s;tick to it; for a better you cannot get, for that Purpo&s;e: But, if it is your Science, quit it for a more virtuous and rational one, and you can hardly go ami&s;s. I am, in true Chri&s;tian Charity,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Deare&s;t</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE filled one Letter &s;o full of Bu&s;ine&s;s, that I had not Room to take Notice of the pretty Part of your la&s;t; but I &s;hall not &s;uffer the Po&s;t to go out without a Letter, intirely in An&s;wer to the refined Scruples you hint at in your's.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="111">Your Love for me does not de&s;troy your pre|&s;ent Happine&s;s, but rather con&s;titutes it. Tho&s;e Apprehen&s;ions, and that Unea&s;ine&s;s, which &s;ome|times afflict you, are not, indeed, Part of your Happine&s;s, but are the natural Con&s;equence of it, in tender and delicate Minds; for Ab&s;ence, or Fear of lo&s;ing, affects us always, in Pro|portion to the Height of our Enjoyments. Now tho&s;e who de&s;ire their Plea&s;ures to be le&s;s, in order to rid them&s;elves of their Pains, know not what they wi&s;h for: Apathy is a wretched Ex|change for fond Sen&s;ations, even with all their Incumbrances; and to prefer &s;uch an Indolence of Mind is, as if a Man &s;hould refu&s;e an E&s;tate, becau&s;e it was &s;ubject to Quit-Rent.</P>
<P>As for your extraordinary Notion, that per|haps your Love and Fondne&s;s for me may af|fect your Happine&s;s hereafter, this mu&s;t be your own Fault, and not the Nature of the Thing, if it &s;hould. The Love of God, and the Love of Man, are very different Things, and both made our expre&s;s Duties, by di&s;tinct Command|ments: Therefore the latter cannot become a Crime, of the Nature you apprehend, even by it's Exce&s;s; for parallel Lines can never inter|fere, though extended infinitely: But the &s;malle&s;t Portion of mortal Love, or any other worldly Affection, ri&s;es into a Sin, when it inter&s;ects, or runs counter to our Love of God, the Duties of Religion, or the Morals of Virtue. Now
<PB N="111" REF="112">
there is nothing, &s;urely, in our cha&s;te, &s;incere, and con&s;tant Regards, toward each other, which can po&s;&s;ibly violate any of the&s;e high Concerns; but rather &s;trengthen us in them, by in&s;piring our Hearts with the mo&s;t grateful Sen&s;e, toward Providence, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our Minds with the warme&s;t Devotion and Thank&s;giving, to the Almighty, for our mutual Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>To a Mind rightly formed, the Paths of Heaven are &s;trewn with Ro&s;es, not &s;tuck with Thorns:
<Q><L>For Heaven is paid, when Man receives;</L>
<L>T'enjoy is to obey.</L></Q>
And the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Plea&s;ures of Life, bounded by Rea&s;on and Religion, beyond which alone we ta&s;te the Bitterne&s;s of the Draught, leads us not a Step out of the Road to Hap|pine&s;s hereafter; referring every thing to God, hymning out his Prai&s;e, and &s;ubmitting our&s;elves implicitly, and humbly, to the Ju&s;tice, Good|ne&s;s, and Wi&s;dom of the divine Di&s;pen&s;ations, whenever Heaven &s;hall think fit to withdraw any of it's <HI>free Gifts</HI> from us.</P>
<P>As for the Concern and Unhappine&s;s we &s;hall unavoidably feel upon the Di&s;appointment or Lo&s;s of tho&s;e Things, which our fond Hearts are &s;et upon here, you need not moralize &s;o rigidly upon this Subject; for this Grief, like the Sighs and Tears which are the Con&s;equence of bodily Pain, will be attributed, by him who
<PB N="112" REF="113">
made us, to the Weakne&s;s of that Nature with which he was plea&s;ed to cloath our Souls; and, in either Ca&s;e, it is not our Feelings, but the Repinings, Impatience, or De&s;pondency, which create the Crime.</P>
<P>You &s;ee I have here renewed the Strain of our former Corre&s;pondence; for I am always plea&s;ed to enter into Subjects with you, when|ever you give me an Opportunity; and, if you would more frequently write to me, in &s;uch a Manner as your la&s;t Letter, to &s;hew the Deli|cacy of your Sentiment, and the Excellency of your Heart, you would do your&s;elf infinite Service, in the Improvement of your own Mind and Virtue, in the Securing of my Love and E&s;teem, and, at the &s;ame Time, afford the mo&s;t extreme Plea&s;ure and Pride to my deare&s;t <HI>Fanny</HI>'s con&s;tant, &s;incere, and fond Hu&s;band,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Deare&s;t</HI> HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you for both your kind Letters:&mdash; They are lively Emblems of your&s;elf; &s;en|&s;ible, philo&s;ophic, affectionate, and polite.</P>
<P>I am always &s;incerely plea&s;ed, when any little Error or Weakne&s;s of mine gives my ever dear
<PB N="113" REF="114">
Preceptor an Opportunity of &s;etting his little Pupil right: And the Trouble you have taken, on this Occa&s;ion, is doubly kind; for, as all the pre&s;ent and pa&s;t Actions of your Life, toward me, may fully ju&s;tify the Exce&s;s of my Affection for you, another Man might have thought it needle&s;s to &s;atisfy the nice Scruples of a weak or delicate Mind; but thou, the dear Di&s;pen&s;er of all Heaven's Bounty to me, ha&s;t convinced me, that it is both my Duty and Happine&s;s, as well as it was my Inclination, to indulge that tender, cha&s;te, and inviolable Affection, which I feel for thee, thou mo&s;t de&s;erving of thy Sex! Nor would change even tho&s;e Pains thy Ab&s;ence gives me, for the dull In&s;en&s;ibility in which the common Race of Mortals pa&s;s their Lives; though I confe&s;s the&s;e Pains imbitter every Hour of Life; for even while you are with me, my Thoughts are continually filled with the &s;ad Idea of our Parting;&mdash;and, indeed, it is dreadful to think of pa&s;&s;ing the Morn of Life, the Sea&s;on for tender Conver&s;e, dome&s;tic Happine&s;s, and &s;o|cial Joys, the Remembrance of which &s;hould gild the down-hill Path, the Evening Tide of Life, in a State of Separation from all we love! to have the fleeting Days of Youth pa&s;s, like a Dream, unmarked by any plea&s;ing Aera, or in|tere&s;ting Event! Not but I agree with <HI>Milton</HI> and <HI>Shaft&s;bury,</HI> that they know not their own Intere&s;t, who wi&s;h never to be &s;eparated from
<PB N="114" REF="115">
tho&s;e they truly love;
<Q>for Solitude is &s;ome|times be&s;t Society; and &s;hort Retirement urges &s;weet Return.</Q>
But mine is, I think, a perpetual State of Bani&s;hment; for the Months you are from me appear like Centuries, and the few Days you are with me fly away like the Moments of a dying Man, who knows he has but one &s;hort Hour to live; or &s;eem, at be&s;t, but like the wretched Exile's Interval of taking Leave for Life.</P>
<P>However, I will, henceforward, remember that Happine&s;s is re&s;erved for Immortality; and learn to con&s;ider tho&s;e Anxieties, which the Ten|derne&s;s of my Affection &s;ometimes occa&s;ions, as the Purcha&s;e of that Felicity, which it has, and I hope will &s;till continue to produce; I mean the redoubled Joys of meeting.</P>
<P>What you &s;ay, with Regard to the Re&s;ent|ment I expre&s;s'd upon <HI>Tom</HI>'s Behaviour, is very ju&s;t; but I own my Nature is warm, and im|patient of Injuries, e&s;pecially when they are loaded with the vile Weight of Ingratitude; but, believe me, <HI>Harry,</HI> I have a Heart as tender, and a Hand as open to &s;oft Compa&s;&s;ion, and to melting Charity, even as your generous Self; but I confe&s;s, with a Kind of Pride not to be de&s;cribed, that, in the &s;toical Habitude of &s;ub|duing the fir&s;t Impul&s;e of Pa&s;&s;ion, and attending to the Dictates of Rea&s;on and Humanity, you have, as in every thing el&s;e, a con&s;iderable Ad|vantage
<PB N="115" REF="116">
over me. You are, indeed, the &s;teady <HI>Rock,</HI> that keeps one even Cour&s;e, and I the un&s;ettled Cloud below, liable to the Gu&s;t of every varying Wind, which veers it from it's purpo&s;ed Bearing.</P>
<P>There is really &s;omething &s;ingular in my Af|fection for you, which makes me triumph at every Mark of your Superiority in Sen&s;e or Virtue, even over my&s;elf; and I feel a more exulting Plea&s;ure at being excelled by you, than I &s;hould in being &s;uperior to all the World be&s;ide. Perhaps this may be owing to my having placed my chief Merit and Happine&s;s in the Tenderne&s;s and Exce&s;s of my Love, (and there alone I will not yield the Prize, even to you;) and as every new Proof of your Worth confirms and ju&s;tifies the ruling Pa&s;&s;ion of my Soul, I am doubly plea&s;ed and grateful for it.</P>
<P>I will not yet de&s;pair of your Succe&s;s with your <HI>petrified Patronymic</HI>; for I depend on your Per&s;everance; and con&s;tant Dropping wears at length the <HI>Marble:</HI> Be&s;ides, you find that the Propo&s;al you made him, two Months ago, has at la&s;t made it's Way, and penetrated into his mo&s;t obdurate Brain. So I take it for granted, that your la&s;t Offer is travelling the &s;ame round-about Road, and may, in the &s;ame Time, arrive, much fatigued with the tedious Barrenne&s;s of the Way, at the &s;ame Inn; and truly I think an Inn a proper Simile for his Brain, where neither
<PB N="116" REF="117">
Sen&s;e nor Science take up their Re&s;t, where every thing pa&s;&s;es in dull Rotation, and leaves no more Impre&s;&s;ion than
<Q>the Remembrance of a Gue&s;t, who tarrieth but a Night.</Q>
If I were Genie of the Black I&s;les, mentioned in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Tales, I would certainly take Mea&s;ure of him, with my Wand, for a compleat Suit of Marble; his Wig, at lea&s;t, &s;hould
<Q>eternal buckle take in <HI>Parian</HI> Stone.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hould have been glad to have known, from the o&s;&s;ified Man, <HI>which</HI> I hear is depo&s;ited in <HI>Dublin</HI> College, whether his Mind partook of his Body's Di&s;order, and if his Heart grew hard in Proportion as his Nerves grew rigid; for if that be the Ca&s;e, I would have the Gentle|man, in Que&s;tion, anointed with Oils, like an Olympic Wre&s;tler; for indeed I believe an Act of Genero&s;ity would be a gymna&s;tic Exerci&s;e to him; and I would have him put to &s;leep in a Tub of Goo&s;e-Grea&s;e, to increa&s;e his Sen|&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Forgive me, <HI>Harry,</HI> for making &s;o free; but I think it is better to laugh than cry, at Things which we cannot remedy; for I do not believe, what poor <HI>Lear</HI> makes a Que&s;tion of, that there is any Cau&s;e, or Cure, in Nature, for hard Hearts.</P>
<P>Your Ob&s;ervation, about <HI>Charles</HI>'s Unea&s;ine&s;s, at being &s;eparated from his Wife, is, I believe, very ju&s;t; for I own I think him incapable of
<PB N="117" REF="118">
that delicate Tenderne&s;s, which renders Ab&s;ence painful; but it is very po&s;&s;ible he may be unea&s;y for the Rea&s;ons you a&s;&s;ign; the Difficulty of Di&s;u&s;e, when Men are governed more by Habit than Rea&s;on; the mi&s;erable Vacuum which this has left in his Mind and Time, and which he is at a Lo&s;s how to fill up, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for there is not, I believe, a more helple&s;s Mortal breathing, or one le&s;s qualified for Solitude: His poor vague Mind is neither imbued with Religion or Philo|&s;ophy, nor &s;tored with Ideas enough to enter|tain him&s;elf, or any one el&s;e, for half an Hour; and, as he is generally much fatigued with Bu|&s;ine&s;s, and cannot read, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall a&s;leep, whenever he is left to him&s;elf; and &s;uch a Situation would make one regret the Lo&s;s of any Sort of Companion; therefore I heartily pity the poor Man.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be very unhappy, if I doubted the Sincerity of your la&s;t Paragraph; but indeed I do not, for you have given me many kind Proofs to illu&s;trate it; and you may believe me, in Return, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that I would be content to give up half the Duration of my Life, to be cer|tain of &s;pending the Remainder of it with you; which is, however, no great Compliment; for all the Time you are ab&s;ent I con&s;ider my&s;elf in a State of Annihilation, as I am deprived of the principal Spring, or Movement, which actuates this little Machine; or, rather, like a Clock,

with the &s;triking Weight taken off, which is &s;ilent, though the Pendulum moves, and only expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf by the <HI>Hand,</HI> as I do now: But, though I am dumb to every one el&s;e, I find, as you may have <HI>long</HI> &s;ince ob&s;erved in this <HI>long</HI> Letter, a va&s;t Inclination of prating away to you; and &s;hould go on with this running Pattern, without any Ground, for an Hour or two more, but that the Piece of Mechani&s;m, I have been alluding to, has, luckily for you, ju&s;t now informed me, that the Po&s;t-Office will be &s;hut in five Minutes. <HI>Adieu!

<P>I AM almo&s;t a&s;hamed to acknowledge the Re|ceipt of my dear <HI>Harry</HI>'s la&s;t Letter. I ab|&s;olutely blu&s;h, while I think of it.

<P>I, by no Means, doubt your receiving much Plea&s;ure from &s;uch a Bundle of my Letters coming at once to your Hands. My Idea of it is like pa&s;&s;ing a Day together. Though the
<PB N="119" REF="120">
Subject was often changed, the Di&s;cour&s;e was continued; while a &s;ingle Letter appears like a &s;hort Vi&s;it, where the greate&s;t Part of tho&s;e Moments, we &s;hould wi&s;h to employ more agreeably, is taken up with the Form of coming in, and going out: Yet, I confe&s;s, I would rather &s;ee a Per&s;on I loved, for half an Hour every Day, than be debarred that Plea&s;ure for a Month, though I were certain they would then &s;tay a Week with me; for I think the
<Q>Joys of Meeting harldly pay the Pangs of Ab&s;ence.</Q>
This may be owing to an Im|patience in my Temper, which I would gladly correct, as it occa&s;ions me many melancholy Hours; for, alas! the greate&s;t Part of my Life is pa&s;&s;ed in a State of Separation from you; and even when you are with me, the Certainty of parting, at &s;uch a Time, embitters the pre&s;ent Plea&s;ure. Pardon me, when I tell you, that I have often &s;u&s;pected your Love, when I have &s;een you quit me, with as much Indifference as you would a common Acquaintance; while my poor fooli&s;h Heart has heaved, and Eyes &s;trained to follow you. I know you have &s;o &s;trong an Under&s;tanding, as would, were you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a fond Weakne&s;s, get the better of it; and yet, at this Moment, I &s;wear (I &s;peak from my own Heart) I wonder how you can bear to be &s;o long, and often, ab&s;ent. There is, I fear, but one Way of accounting for it;&mdash;
<PB N="120" REF="121">

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXII. <HI>HENRY</HI> to <HI>FRANCES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BELIEVE me &s;incere in my Prai&s;es of you; for, upon that Subject, all Hyperbole is lo&s;t in Truth. Whether, indeed, you really de&s;erve all that I think, which is ten-fold more than ever I &s;aid of you, I cannot tell: Nay, &s;ometimes I fancy not; only for this Rea&s;on, that I am afraid there is not, in Reality, any Woman in the World &s;o charming, as I imagine you to be; yet your Merit is the &s;ame to me, which is ca|pable of in&s;piring me with &s;uch plea&s;ing Ideas; as it amounts to the &s;ame, let Sceptics wrangle ever &s;o long, whether there is &s;uch a Thing as Matter in the Univer&s;e, or whether it is only a Spirit, which has the Power of conveying &s;uch an Idea to our Sen&s;es. And, as the amiable Opinion I have of my deare&s;t <HI>Fanny</HI> makes up mo&s;t of my Happine&s;s in this Life, I &s;hall con|&s;ider
<PB N="122" REF="123">
it as <HI>Cicero</HI> does an higher Subject,
<Q>that, if it &s;hould be a Mi&s;take, I would not part with the Belief of it, for a Certainty of the highe&s;t Good, in this World.</Q></P>
<P>Your Simile, with Regard to your Letters, has a pretty Fancy in it; and there is a good deal of the &s;ame Kind of Turn in many of your Writings, which has often made me declare, that I never met with any thing, in the epi&s;to|lary Stile, &s;o very clever, as they are; &s;o that, even ab&s;tracted from the Con&s;ideration of their coming from you, and being addre&s;&s;ed to me, I do not read any thing, which gives me a more refined Entertainment.</P>
<P>I take it very unkindly, your &s;eeming to &s;u&s;|pect me of the lea&s;t Indifference to you. When|ever I can be near you, how few Hours am I from you? And, be a&s;&s;ured, it is my Misfor|tune, not my Fault, that I am not con&s;tantly with you. If I do not always part from you with the Appearance of that Fondne&s;s, which you might expect, it is owing intirely to that Temper, which I have endeavoured to practi&s;e my&s;elf into, as I have very little of it from Nature. No Man has more Tenderne&s;s, or &s;oft Affection about his Heart, than I have; and my Philo&s;ophy, which is not of the Stoic Kind, does not make me feel le&s;s in my&s;elf, but only &s;erves to &s;ave Appearances to the re&s;t of the World. How often, my dear <HI>Fanny,</HI> have I
<PB N="123" REF="124">
mo&s;t earne&s;tly intreated of you never to &s;ay any thing of that Kind to me again? and, if you re|collect your&s;elf, you will find, we have had very few Di&s;putes, but upon this Subject.</P>

<P>I RECEIVED your's by the Stage, and that by the Po&s;t, within the &s;ame Hour. I am, however, obliged to you for your De&s;ign of ex|pediting it, though it did not an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I have &s;omewhere (I think in the <HI>Spectator</HI>) met a Compari&s;on between the Effect, which Prai&s;e has on a generous Mind, and fine Weather, on a Thermometer. I like the Si|mile, and think it might be carried a great Way. I am not a&s;hamed to own, that I re|ceive the highe&s;t Tran&s;port from your Prai&s;e: It rai&s;es &s;uch a noble Emulation in my Mind, as would, were my Power equal to my Will, render me worthy of it. I think there is a Kind of In&s;piration in your Prai&s;e, which might lead me to any great or virtuous Act: Add to this, that it &s;ets my Faults and Foibles in the &s;tronge&s;t Light. I con&s;ider you as the Per&s;on, who has be&s;towed the Merits you approve of;
<PB N="124" REF="125">
and find my&s;elf a&s;hamed of every Weakne&s;s I di&s;cover in my&s;elf, which may le&s;&s;en them. In &s;hort, it has the &s;ame Effect on the Qualities of my Mind, which our Belief of the divine Om|nipre&s;ence ought to have on all our Actions. May my dear <HI>Harry</HI> continue &s;till to &s;ee me with the &s;ame Eyes of Fondne&s;s, 'till, by never cea&s;ing to de&s;ire, I, at la&s;t, de&s;erve his Prai&s;e! and &s;o, as you &s;omewhere &s;ay,
<Q>&s;trengthen Habit into Virtue.</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding your repeated Interdictions, I mu&s;t a&s;k one Que&s;tion: Why &s;hould you en|deavour to get the better of that natural Softne&s;s, you &s;ay you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of? why lay your&s;elf under a Re&s;traint, to appear indifferent to the Woman you love? You cannot be a&s;hamed of that Pa&s;&s;ion, which is the Boa&s;t of human Nature. If then you thought the Object worthy of your Tenderne&s;s, why &s;hould you wi&s;h to &s;uppre&s;s it? nay, why not boa&s;t
<Q>the graceful Weakne&s;s of your Heart?</Q>
I mu&s;t &s;ay, you are a Laggard in the Race of Love: I have out-&s;tripped, and left you far behind:
<Q>My <HI>Anthony</HI> is fat, and &s;cant of Breath.</Q>
At the Hazard of every thing, that is dear to me, I have proclaimed my Fondne&s;s; and do you blu&s;h at your's? Indeed I claim no Merit from the too public Confe&s;&s;ion of my Love:&mdash; I could not help it; for
<Q>I am made a &s;hallow, forded Stream, &s;een to the Bottom, all my Clearne&s;s
<PB N="125" REF="126">
&s;corned, and all my Faults expo&s;ed.</Q>
My Nature is not capable of Di&s;gui&s;e; nor do I wi&s;h it were.&mdash;I hope we &s;hall never di&s;pute on this, or any other Subject: I do, indeed, believe you love me; and &s;hall conclude with your own Quotation,
<Q>that, if it &s;hould be a Mi&s;take, I would not part with the Belief of it, for a Certainty of the highe&s;t Good in this World.</Q></P>
<P>I am &s;orry I ever thought of leaving <HI>England:</HI> It has co&s;t me much Unea&s;ine&s;s. I am &s;till un|determined. I fear my Re&s;olution will not &s;tand the Shock of quitting you: Believe me, I have nothing el&s;e to encounter:&mdash;My Intere&s;t and Plea&s;ure both point the Way; yet &s;till I loiter here. If my Going were fixed, I &s;hould &s;uffer as much on your Account, as my own. Ab|&s;ence, and a &s;trong Probability of never meeting more, might, perhaps, make us both regret our having ever met. The Delicacy of my Love is &s;hocked, by &s;uppo&s;ing we &s;hall ever repent our mutual Affection, or Engagements; yet, under the Circum&s;tances I have mentioned, it is not impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould happen. While we retain the plea&s;ing. Expectation of &s;eeing each other, our Thoughts are all employed on the approaching Joy, and every intervening Object appears &s;carce worthy our Regard: But, were we parted with a moral Certainty, that Years mu&s;t roll before we meet again, would it not be natural to &s;eek for a Con&s;olation among tho&s;e,
<PB N="126" REF="127">
who could be&s;t make Amends for the Lo&s;s we had &s;u&s;tained? and who can &s;ay to their Heart, "thus far &s;halt thou go, and no farther?"&mdash; You have loved before, and may again. This Thought, I own, di&s;turbs me: But why &s;hould I torment my&s;elf with (I hope) groundle&s;s Fears? for I will not part with thee.&mdash;Let me be &s;ati&s;|fied that you de&s;ire my Stay, then find the Plea|&s;ure, or Advantage, that &s;hall force me from thee.&mdash;Let not this Confe&s;&s;ion put you under any Re&s;traint; for this be a&s;&s;ured of; though, at your De&s;ire, I would chearfully forego every other Happine&s;s in Life, I will, if you require it, as readily embrace the Pro&s;pect of an everla&s;ting Separation:&mdash;My Heart &s;hall only feel, not &s;peak it's Angui&s;h. Here give me Leave to re|mind you of a Conver&s;ation we had on this Subject &s;ome little Time before you left <HI>London:</HI> The Amount of it was, that, when I left the Kingdom, we &s;hould no longer maintain any Corre&s;pondence, but mutually endeavour to forget each other. To this I &s;tedfa&s;tly adhere: For why &s;hould we &s;trive to make each other more unhappy? If I go, I again repeat my De&s;ire of not &s;eeing you: Indeed I could not bear it.&mdash;But I do not think I &s;hall go.&mdash;I will let it re&s;t intirely upon you.</P>
<P>I told you, in my la&s;t Letter, I had given up the Thoughts of going to the Country; yet I long to &s;ee you; and, could I as ea&s;ily go to

you, as you can come to me, I would not com|plain of Ab&s;ence. I have much to &s;ay to you; but, if I leave <HI>England,</HI> my Thoughts and Faults be buried with me!&mdash;Though I have no Right to expect a Letter by To-morrow's Po&s;t, I hope for one.</P>
<P>I have not <HI>Pliny</HI> by me now: But, though I am ignorant of the Text, I admire the Com|ment; which I beg you will continue. I look on it, at pre&s;ent, as I &s;hould on a large Sum of Money, which I had in re&s;erve, to purcha&s;e &s;ome particular Plea&s;ure, at a &s;tated Time. I therefore, again, de&s;ire you will go on in|crea&s;ing my little Hoard, more valuable to me, than all the Wealth of <HI>Croe&s;us.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your Letter upon the Subject of your leaving <HI>England</HI>; of which you de&s;ire my Opinion. I refer my deare&s;t Life to a former Letter, wrote upon this Occa&s;ion:
<PB N="128" REF="129">
The Particulars of it I do not, at pre&s;ent, re|collect; but am certain of this, that my Senti|ments are &s;till the &s;ame, as both my Love and Friend&s;hip for you are &s;o. In &s;hort, I &s;hall neither con&s;ent to it, becau&s;e it is agreeable to your Inclinations, nor di&s;&s;ent from it, becau&s;e it is irk&s;ome to mine; but &s;hall venture to let it re&s;t upon a more infallible Principle, by referring my Heart's be&s;t Love to Lady &mdash;'s Determi|nation about the Matter. Her Sen&s;e can direct, and her Goodne&s;s will &s;upport you. May Heaven ble&s;s you! And, if I could, at any Time, recommend my&s;elf to Providence, with that fervent Devotion, which my Soul feels, at pre&s;ent, for you, I &s;hould think, at that Mo|ment, it were a Bli&s;s to die.</P>
<P>When you fir&s;t mentioned Lady &mdash;'s leaving the Kingdom, I confe&s;s received a Shock, which I could not account for: I did not know her enough to feel any per&s;onal Concern at her Lo&s;s; but your la&s;t Letter has given me &s;ome Super&s;tition, which could never affect me, if my Spirits were not as low, as they are at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It was extremely unkind, at this Time, to mention your Letters, after the Manner you did. You &s;peak of quitting the Kingdom; and, at the &s;ame Time, grudge to leave me even your Picture, more e&s;timable than any that <HI>Titian</HI> ever drew. When you de&s;ired me merely to
<PB N="129" REF="130">
return them, you were cruel only to me; but when you reque&s;ted me to de&s;troy them, you were unkind to the World, which may, perhaps, one Day &s;ee them. I de&s;pair of any, the &s;malle&s;t Portion of Fame, from my own Writings; but to be loved and prai&s;ed in your's, may render my Name immortal. So <HI>Phaon</HI> will be ever remembered: But the &s;ame Fate cannot attend us both; for he, from his Incon&s;tancy, as <HI>Pope</HI> &s;trongly expre&s;&s;es it, is but
<Q>damned to ever|la&s;ting Fame.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall not dwell any longer on the Subject of your Letter, becau&s;e, indeed, I find my&s;elf too much affected with it; and I cannot, in my pre&s;ent Temper of Mind, think of <HI>Pliny,</HI> or any thing el&s;e. &mdash; So I &s;hall make my Letter &s;horter, than I am ever inclined to do to you.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with a Saying of &s;ome of the Philo&s;ophers,
<Q>that the Grief at lo&s;ing a Thing, and the Fear of lo&s;ing it, are equal.</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXV. <HI>FRANCES</HI> to <HI>HENRY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I WOULD have an&s;wered your's of the 7th la&s;t Po&s;t; but my not being well, joined to the pre&s;ent un&s;ettled Situation of my Mind, had &s;o much lowered my Spirits, that I feared my Letter would appear to you of the &s;plenetic Ca&s;t.</P>
<P>I now return my Thanks for the very elegant Compliments you make me. To de&s;erve them, would be too high a Boa&s;t for the mo&s;t perfect of my Sex; yet I confe&s;s, though con&s;cious of my Want of Merit, I feel a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure, mixed with Pride, (not Vanity,) when prai&s;ed by you. Though I am, perhaps, naturally vain, I find my&s;elf humbled, by the very Means which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to rai&s;e it. I look on the Compliments, you make me, as I &s;hould on a Picture, which, though I had &s;at for, the Painter, from the Elegance of his Fancy, not Judgment, had made a fini&s;hed Beauty. I am, however, proud of that Affection, which can, to the very few Merits I po&s;&s;e&s;s, add the Multi|tude I want, and place me in &s;uch a Light, as it &s;hould be my utmo&s;t Wi&s;h to appear in.</P>
<P>I have much to tell you about our Lady &mdash;. I am, at pre&s;ent, a good deal &s;urprized at not hearing from her. She has wrote for her Chil|dren
<PB N="131" REF="132">
to leave Town on <HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI>&mdash;Is it not &s;trange &s;he did not mention me? Though I cannot account for it, I am re&s;olved to give her Credit for acting right: She mu&s;t have &s;trong Rea&s;ons for altering her Purpo&s;e. I neither can, nor will &s;u&s;pect any Change in her Friend&s;hip: She gave it me voluntarily, unmerited, and un|&s;ought; and, &s;hould &s;he withdraw it, I have not any Right to complain;&mdash;but I will not torment my&s;elf with anticipating what I &s;hould, indeed, think a &s;evere Misfortune. To-morrow's Po&s;t may, perhaps, clear all.</P>
<P>I wrote to de&s;ire your Opinion about my going with <HI>Nancy.</HI> I have changed my Mind, in that Particular, and think of it no longer. If I were certain of going to <HI>France,</HI> I could not bear the Agony of a la&s;t Parting; which, I am &s;ure, that would be: The Pain is already pa&s;t; why &s;hould I renew it? We are &s;eparated; let us remain &s;o.&mdash;If I &s;tay in the Kingdom, it would be an idle Frolic, and might be attended with di&s;agreeable Con&s;equences.&mdash;I will not go there, on any Terms.</P>
<P>Your la&s;t Letter has almo&s;t di&s;tracted me. How can you write with &s;uch tender Concern, yet leave me in Su&s;pence? When I apply to you, my Guide, my Director, for Advice, why refer me to another? Is there a Creature breath|ing, on who&s;e Love, or Friend&s;hip, I ought to depend, more than your's? I hoped there was
<PB N="132" REF="133">
not: If I have been deceived, it is equal what becomes of me.&mdash;I will not indulge a Thought &s;o injurious to your Honour, and my Peace. How can you &s;ay it is agreeable to my Inclina|tions to quit <HI>you</HI>? for I neither think or &s;peak of any other Tye.&mdash;In Return for your unkind Su&s;picion, I might tell you, that Thought was &s;ugge&s;ted by your Wi&s;hes, rather than Opinion. You know my Heart hangs on you; you are it's Support, and the &s;ole Source of all it's Hap|pine&s;s, or Mi&s;ery; and is it po&s;&s;ible you can &s;u&s;pect my Love? Does not your own Heart bear Witne&s;s for me, and contradict &s;o cruel an A&s;per&s;ion? Unkind, ill-natured <HI>Harry!</HI> &mdash;Per|haps I wrong you. My Concern tran&s;ports me beyond the Bounds of Rea&s;on. You could not mean to injure me &s;o highly.</P>
<P>The Concern, you expre&s;s, at my leaving the Kingdom, &s;hall, for the pre&s;ent, prevent my taking any Steps towards it, 'till I have your Opinion in more explicit Terms; for by that only I will be determined. What can prevent your giving it freely? You certainly know what you would have me do; and you are bound, by every Tye, to direct and guide my little Bark through all the Storms of Life.</P>
<P>Though I &s;hould be glad my Letters were de&s;troyed, I will not, if I go, de&s;ire to deprive you of them: Their Value is owing to your Opinion: The in&s;i&s;ting on them would be &s;ome|what
<PB N="133" REF="134">
like &s;tealing your Reputation; impoveri&s;h|ing you, without enriching my&s;elf. It would give me the greate&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s, if I thought they would be ever &s;een by a third Per&s;on. They were wrote from my Heart to your's, without a View of extorting Prai&s;e; and were never de&s;igned for the unfeeling Vulgar. I have not any Apprehen&s;ion of their being made public. You will not, for your own Sake, expo&s;e my Weakne&s;s to the World; and I dare &s;wear there is not another Per&s;on in it, who would think them worth the Trouble of reading. I confe&s;s I have often wi&s;hed for &s;o much Ge|nius, or poetic Fire, call it which you plea&s;e, as might tran&s;mit to Po&s;terity an Idea of my Affection for you, and
<Q>graft my Love im|mortal on thy Fame:</Q>
But that Wi&s;h, like mo&s;t of mine, is vain. <HI>Apollo</HI> denied my Suit, though &s;econded by the antient, not modern, <HI>Cupid</HI>; but made me large Amends, by pro|mi&s;ing that my Name &s;hould be immortalized by you.</P>
<P>I have this In&s;tant recollected, that on this Day Twelvemonth I fir&s;t &s;aw <HI>Belvidere</HI>: Will you forgive me, if I &s;ay, I wi&s;h I had never &s;een it? What an infinite deal of Anxiety have we &s;uffered for each other, &s;ince that Aera! and who can tell where it will end? Believe me, my Heart's dear <HI>Harry,</HI> this Reflection affords me as much Unea&s;ine&s;s on your Account, as on
<PB N="134" REF="135">
my own: I fear we were born to make each other unhappy.&mdash;This, I own, is a Reflection unbecoming the Woman you love; but &s;till I am a Woman; and, though I think your loving me would make Amends for every Di&s;tre&s;s, that could befal <HI>me,</HI> I cannot bear to con&s;ider my&s;elf as the Cau&s;e of any Misfortune to <HI>you.</HI> Had we not met, at that unlucky Cri&s;is, I &s;hould, at this Time, have been happily in|different to all your Sex; and you, perhaps, might have been fortunately engaged in the laudable Pur&s;uit of &s;ome more worthy and amiable Woman.&mdash;But, as I am &s;o far a Pre|de&s;tinarian, as to believe
<Q>whatever is, is right,</Q>
I think there &s;eems a Kind of Fate in our Reconciliation. We have mutually given up the Prime of our Lives to each other; and, after an Acquaintance of almo&s;t &s;ix Years, we find our Love, Friend&s;hip, and E&s;teem, in|crea&s;ing every Day.&mdash;Does not this look as if we &s;hould &s;pend the calm Evening, as well as the Noontide of our Lives, together? I will indulge this Hope, ca&s;t every black, and gloomy Thought behind, and rely on the Opinion I have of your Love, and the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own, for all my future Happine&s;s. &mdash; Do with me what you will; bid me go, or &s;tay; I will chearfully conform to whatever is mo&s;t agreeable to you.</P>
<Q><PB N="135" REF="136">
<L>My Thoughts &s;hall fix, my late&s;t Wi&s;h depend,</L>
<L>On thee, Guide, Guardian, Kin&s;man, Father, Friend.</L>
<L>By all the&s;e tender Names be <HI>Henry</HI> known</L>
<L>To <HI>Fanny</HI>'s Heart; and grateful let him own,</L>
<L>That &s;he, of all Mankind, has lov'd but him alone.</L></Q>
<P>I beg you to excu&s;e this wild Rhap&s;ody. My Thoughts are not reduced to any Kind of Form: They are filled with Love, Grief, and you. If I had wrote la&s;t Po&s;t I would not &s;end this: I am quite a&s;hamed of it: Indeed it is &s;ad inco|herent Stuff. Can you blame me for not being Mi&s;tre&s;s of my&s;elf, when I think of parting from you? I have done nothing but weep &s;ince I received your la&s;t Letter. If you con&s;ent to my going, do not write &s;o tenderly; for it will only make our Parting more painful.</P>
<P>I have yet a thou&s;and Things to &s;ay to you, but cannot &s;peak them. I have already &s;aid too much; yet, like a peevi&s;h Child, I go on &s;ob|bing to my&s;elf, after my Rea&s;on tells me I &s;hould have done.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I &s;aid your going to <HI>France</HI> was contrary to my Inclinations, I did not mean &s;elfi&s;hly; it was my Fears and Appre|hen&s;ions of many Kinds, which made my Sen|timents doubtful about the Matter: And when I &s;aid it was agreeable to your's, I did not mean to upbraid you for the Want of any, the lea&s;t Part of that Affection, and kind Regard, you have &s;o generou&s;ly be&s;towed upon me; but merely alluded to the great Hopes, and &s;anguine Expectations, which you had formerly from this Scheme, and which, I thought, depended on too many Hazards, to be ha&s;tily ventured upon. For both the&s;e Rea&s;ons, therefore, I referred a Determination in this Matter to Lady &mdash;, becau&s;e her Patronage and Protection would obviate a good deal of my Fears, and ju&s;tify a great deal of your Hopes; and in that Ca&s;e I &s;hould &s;ubmit, though in any Ca&s;e I could never con&s;ent. Be well a&s;&s;ured, my Heart's fonde&s;t Wi&s;h, that no Di&s;tance in this World,

nor Chance in this Life, can ever alter my Love, my Friend&s;hip, my tendere&s;t Regard toward you; for, as I think it is impo&s;&s;ible they can ever improve, I am certain, from late Experience, and frequent Reflection both upon you and my|&s;elf, that my warme&s;t Affection, highe&s;t E&s;teem, and &s;incere&s;t Attachment both to your Per&s;on and Merits, will la&s;t during our Lives, and can only be increa&s;ed or improved hereafter.</P>
<P>Your mentioning the fir&s;t Day you came to <HI>Belvidere,</HI> has made me recollect, that I am but about a Year old; for I ca&s;t every Day out of my Aera, before the Time I may be truly &s;aid to begin to live; though, as I reckon my whole Exi&s;tence only with regard to you, I &s;hall thus divide it: The 12th of <HI>May,</HI> 1746, I was born; the 6th of <HI>November</HI> following I was chri&s;tened; and the 13th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1750, I became of Age; and I &s;hould deem that the Day of my Death, upon which we &s;hould ever be parted.

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE you de&s;ire me to continue my Notes upon <HI>Pliny,</HI> I &s;hall go on with that Subject again.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Epi&s;tle of the third Book puts me in mind of Lord <HI>Orrery</HI>'s Wi&s;h about the latter Scenes of his Life, hinted at in one of my former Letters to you; and in the Pa&s;&s;age I here allude to, for Want of better Light from Hi&s;tory, he &s;uppo&s;es after what Manner <HI>Pliny</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the Decline of Life; but I think the latter Part of the Letter, I am now upon, affords a &s;trong Pre&s;umption of this Suppo&s;ition; and, as <HI>Pliny</HI> de&s;ires <HI>Calvi&s;ius</HI> to keep that Letter by him, in order to judge of his Philo&s;ophy, &s;o &s;hall we remember Lord <HI>Orrery</HI>'s Declaration with the &s;ame View. I think the Character of <HI>Spurinna</HI> not unlike his own; and there is one Circum&s;tance hinted at, when he takes the Air in his Chariot, in which they happily agree. In this Letter there is a pretty Di&s;tinction between being plea&s;ed, and being proud of a Thing.
<Q>The only Mark of Age he di&s;covers, is Prudence.</Q>
This is a fine Trait.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140">In the &s;ixth Epi&s;tle of the &s;ame Book, in the Comment on it, Lord <HI>Orrery</HI> gives us a gay Ode, to divert our Thoughts from the melan|choly Pro&s;pect of an old Man; which is like the merry Epilogues, they give us often, after our Tragedies. This Argument has been treated pro and con in the <HI>Spectators:</HI> But for my Part, I always chu&s;e to retire with the Bier; for &s;ober Thoughts do me no Harm, as I can be grave, without being melancholy. I am &s;urprized his Lord&s;hip &s;hould &s;ay an old Man was a di&s;mal Sight; for a Per&s;on, who views all Things
<Q>In the calm Light of mild Philo&s;ophy,</Q>
regards with equal Eyes both Youth and Age; nay, I cannot think it requires any great Strain|ing of Philo&s;ophy to bear even our own Decay, as there are Plea&s;ures and Solations indulged by Providence to every Stage of Life; and, to a Mind rightly turned, perhaps, not the lea&s;t to the la&s;t; and, if any Unea&s;ine&s;s ari&s;es in our Sene&s;cence, from a nearer Pro&s;pect of the Grave, it is unbecoming a Chri&s;tian, who re&s;ts in Hope.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething extremely elegant, and a fine Addre&s;s of Compliment, in &s;everal of <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Epi&s;tles, with a certain <HI>Tour d'Expre&s;&s;ion et de Sentiment,</HI> which is ob&s;ervable in the Writings of the be&s;t and polite&s;t <HI>French</HI> Authors. I &s;hall give you but one Example, among many; becau&s;e I would not prevent you, as you have
<PB N="140" REF="141">
not gone through his Works. It is in the eighth Epi&s;tle of this Book:
<Q>And, &s;ince it is equally excellent to merit and confer Benefits, I &s;ee you are re&s;olved to lay Claim to the Prai&s;e of both, by giving to another what you have de&s;erved your&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>In the Ob&s;ervations upon the &s;econd Epi&s;tle of the fourth Book, my Lord, after his humane Way, reprimands <HI>Pliny</HI> for his frequent Abu&s;e of <HI>Regulus</HI>; which, as I hinted, is an In&s;tance of his Humanity, but not of his Judgment. There are many Men of vile De&s;erts, &s;o far beyond the Reach of Laws, that there is no Way to puni&s;h them, but by Satire or Invective; and I believe that &s;everal People, naturally vicious in them&s;elves, have been re&s;trained within the Bounds of &s;ocial Morality, not from Re&s;pect to the Tables, but out of Fear of being
<Q>damn'd to everla&s;ting Fame.</Q>
From the whole Tenor of <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Character, and it is this Way we &s;hould judge of Men, he inveighs again&s;t <HI>Regulus</HI> from a virtuous Rage, rather than from Hatred, Malice, or any Un|charitablene&s;s. This puts me in Mind of a Sentiment of your's, upon &s;ome &s;uch Occa&s;ion as this, which may not be improperly repeated here: It is upon the Subject of Revenge;
<Q>As a Pa&s;&s;ion, it is a Vice; but, as a Principle, a Virtue.</Q>
Pur&s;ued with Malice and Ill-nature,
<PB N="141" REF="142">
upon &s;light or common Provocations, it is a Pa&s;&s;ion in&s;tigated by the Devil; but great and real Injuries, proceeding from extreme Vice and Immorality, call aloud for Ju&s;tice, and then Vengeance becomes a godlike Principle. Perhaps it would be a proper Critici&s;m here, to di&s;tingui&s;h between the Words <HI>revenge</HI> and <HI>avenge.</HI></P>
<P>In the latter Part of the Comment upon the fourth Epi&s;tle, there is a very ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation, That it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for us to be as wary in the Choice of our Amu&s;ements, as of our Studies: For which Rea&s;on, I have often thought, that there wanted extremely &s;uch an Office to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in all States, as a general Reveller; who &s;hould pre&s;cribe and pre&s;ide over the Amu&s;ements, Plea&s;ures, and Diver&s;ions of all Ranks, all Profe&s;&s;ions, and all Ages of Men, even from their childi&s;h Years; which would be an In&s;titution of admirable Service to the World.</P>
<P>Read the whole nineteenth Epi&s;tle, and the Comment upon it. I fancy there are &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in both, which will &s;trike and plea&s;e my dear <HI>Fanny</HI>; and, in order to leave the Impre&s;&s;ion on your Mind, I &s;hall put an End to this Letter, with the Addition only of an Allu&s;ion to one of <HI>Prior</HI>'s Poems,
<Q>So thinking on thy charming Youth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXVIII. <HI>HENRY</HI> to <HI>FRANCES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I SUPPOSE, by my not hearing from you la&s;t Po&s;t, that you do not get my Letters regularly; which, I hope, is owing to your being retired to the Rock, though you have, at pre&s;ent, extreme bad Weather for Bathing. I have a melancholy Pro&s;pect before me for my Wheat Harve&s;t, and I have the greate&s;t Quantity, and the be&s;t in this Country; mo&s;t of which is lodged by the Rain, and &s;hedding by the Wind. Mais vive la Philo&s;ophie!</P>
<P>I hope to have a Letter from you To-day; but cannot get it, before this goes to the Po&s;t: So I &s;hall go on with my <HI>Pliny,</HI> which I never read, but when I am to write to you; and, as I undertook this Work merely for your Amu&s;e|ment, &s;o I find it now, for that Rea&s;on, if I had no other, the plea&s;ante&s;t Manner of reading: It is certainly the mo&s;t improving Method too; and, if I had a great Fortune, I would allow a good Salary to a Librarian, who &s;hould <HI>antecede</HI> my Study, and mark out to me only tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, which were remarkable or ingenious, improving or entertaining; as I would give my new Shoes to a Servant to wear fir&s;t. The Per&s;on, I would employ for this Purpo&s;e, &s;hould
<PB N="143" REF="144">
rather be one of a refined Ta&s;te than of deep Learning, and of more natural Under&s;tanding than great acquired Knowledge. In &s;hort, my deare&s;t <HI>Fanny,</HI> you &s;hould be my <HI>Minerva,</HI> my Preceptor; for even from your Fragments I might hope to grow rich in Wi&s;dom, and to be <HI>poli&s;hed into Virtue.</HI> This la&s;t Expre&s;&s;ion has made a Sentiment occur to me, that there is a certain refined Ta&s;te, (Par&s;ons may call it Grace, if they will) which, unle&s;s born with a Man, the be&s;t-di&s;po&s;ed Chri&s;tian will be but an heavy, unformed Lump of Morality. What is that Reverence for the Antients, that humane Love for our Cotemporaries, that generous Benevolence for Po&s;terity, that tender Sen&s;e for another's Sorrow, that high Reli&s;h for a Stranger's Happine&s;s, and, la&s;tly, that noble, philo&s;ophic, heart-thrilling, and religious Ardor, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the whole Soul with enthu&s;ia&s;tic Rapture, upon the Contemplation of the a&s;to|ni&s;hing Greatne&s;s of the Works of Providence, and the infinite Goodne&s;s of their incompre|hen&s;ible Author? What are all the&s;e refined Plea&s;ures owing to, I &s;ay, but to a natural Ta&s;te and quick Reli&s;h for Virtue; to a certain gifted Capacity, large enough to comprehend the whole intellectual Univer&s;e; that is, all Man|kind, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come; and reaches &s;o high, as to embrace even God him&s;elf? all which a plain, good Man has no more Idea of,
<PB N="144" REF="145">
than we can of the Plea&s;ures of a &s;ixth Sen&s;e. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> has &s;omewhat the &s;ame Turn of Thought with Regard to Piety, when he &s;ays,
<Q>that &s;ome People want Parts to be devout, and could as &s;oon make an Epic Poem, as a fervent Prayer.</Q></P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Pliny,</HI> who is properly enough introduced after &s;uch a Subject, as carried me beyond my&s;elf ju&s;t now.</P>
<P>The twenty-fir&s;t Epi&s;tle of the fourth Book is an extreme pretty one. I wept for the <HI>Helvidiae,</HI> not &s;o much for their Death, as for <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Grief at it.</P>
<P>In the next Epi&s;tle there is a poetical Wit|tici&s;m in the Allu&s;ion of the Arrow; which is, I think, the fir&s;t In&s;tance of that Kind, I have met with in this Author.</P>
<P>I am charmed with the whole twenty-third Epi&s;tle. That truly noble and philo&s;ophic Ex|clamation, wi&s;hing for that Stage of Life, when he might live to him&s;elf, tran&s;ports me. There is nothing, for which I de&s;pi&s;e a Per&s;on &s;o much, as the paltry Wi&s;h to be younger; a childi&s;h Longing for a Bib and Bells again! He mu&s;t have &s;pent his Life very ill, or mean to do &s;o, who would de&s;ire to return back to any Aera of it; for we are, at any Stage, capable of Virtue.</P>
<P>In the twenty-eighth Epi&s;tle, <HI>Pliny</HI> has mi&s;|taken the Matter, with regard to Painting; for,
<PB N="145" REF="146">
I think, it is a much ea&s;ier Matter to copy a Picture, than to draw from the Life.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t Epi&s;tle of this fourth Book, he mentions a Spring, which ebbed and flowed. There is a Well &s;ome Miles from this, which is reported to do the &s;ame. I never examined into it, but &s;hall ride over there &s;ome Day, on Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I am &s;urprized, that any Per&s;on of common Sen&s;e could mi&s;take the Legacy, which he was &s;o plea&s;ed with, Epi&s;tle I. Book V. for that from <HI>Curianus</HI> was the only one, which did him Honour. He &s;ays,
<Q>A &s;mall Legacy is fallen to me;</Q>
which &s;hews, he was telling his Friend &s;omething new: And the former Legacy was above two Years before, at lea&s;t; for he &s;ays, that the Suit, with the Coheirs, was of &s;o long &s;tanding. The Mi&s;take of the Com|mentator's could never have happened, but from the mere Force of Prejudice; which has amazing Powers, in many higher In&s;tances. <HI>Pliny</HI> fir&s;t &s;peaks of <HI>Pomponia</HI>'s Favour, to which it was natural to apply his Expre&s;&s;ions of the Grateful|ne&s;s of the Pre&s;ent; and, leaving the Reader in this Error, almo&s;t during the whole Letter, what he &s;ays at la&s;t, tho' it breaks with full Day upon you, could not open the Eyes of Prejudice.</P>
<P>In the fourth Epi&s;tle you may &s;ee the extra|vagant Fees, which were given to Lawyers, in <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Time. This may make us a little better
<PB N="146" REF="147">
reconciled to the Extortion in our own Days: Though, to view this Matter in the Light of political Morality, the pre&s;ent Exorbitancy ought to alarm us extremely; for, the higher Law or Ju&s;tice is vended, the &s;carcer it mu&s;t be; and the Poor, who need it mo&s;t, will, con&s;equently, have lea&s;t of it. Then Oppre&s;&s;ion reigns, and Liberty is no more; and then is a State in the proper Cri&s;is for a Revolution, either by Rebel|lion at home, or Inva&s;ion from abroad. At the Time <HI>Pliny</HI> hints at this Extravagance, the great <HI>Roman</HI> Empire was ha&s;tening to it's Ruin.</P>

<P><PB N="147" REF="148">I have read &s;ome Pages this Morning in the &s;econd Volume of <HI>Orrery</HI>'s <HI>Pliny</HI>; but &s;hould not, at this Time, think of entertaining you out of this Author, if I had not from thence a fair Opportunity of addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf more particularly to my Heart's only Aim.</P>
<P>You may remember, that you rallied me upon not taking Notice of <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Epi&s;tles to <HI>Calpurnia,</HI> in my former Remarks; but I de|fended my&s;elf, upon there not being any in the fir&s;t Volume. The fourth of the &s;ixth Book, which is the fir&s;t of the &s;econd Volume, is the fir&s;t of the&s;e Epi&s;tles.

Whenever I rai&s;e a Statue to <HI>Pliny,</HI> I will have that whole Epi&s;tle in&s;cribed on the Pede&s;tal.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t Lines of the fortieth Page con|tain a very fine and a ju&s;t Sentiment. From the &s;econd Paragraph of the Comment upon this &s;ixteenth Epi&s;tle, you may draw a Compari&s;on between <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> by ob&s;erving, that the little Jingle, and affected Turns, in both their Writings, were rather the fal&s;e Ta&s;te of their Age, than the Vices of the Authors.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="149">The Reflection in the &s;eventeenth Epi&s;tle, that
<Q>he, who envies another, mu&s;t be his Inferior,</Q>
is fine.</P>
<P>At the End of the Notes upon the fourth Epi&s;tle of the &s;eventh Book, Lord <HI>Orrery</HI> wi&s;hes that this Letter had peri&s;hed; I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e it betrays a little Vanity about his trifling Per|formances in Poetry. He is very often angry at him, when he &s;hews a Weakne&s;s of any Kind; becau&s;e it is natural for us to wi&s;h tho&s;e, we love or e&s;teem for &s;ome Qualities, perfect in all. Now I am not quite &s;o &s;evere in this Matter: "Non ego paucis offendor Maculis." Human Nature has many Foibles; and, when I perceive &s;ome in a great Character, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;ee the whole Man; but, when a perfect Sy&s;tem is pre&s;ented to me, I &s;u&s;pect the Genuinene&s;s of the whole; for, as I conclude a Part is acted &s;omewhere, I think it po&s;&s;ible it may be done throughout: Which gives me Occa&s;ion to re|mark upon the only Foible, I ever could object to my own <HI>Calpurnia</HI>; that I have now begun to con&s;ider it like a Tree or Shrub, which happens &s;ometimes to be met with in forming the regular Alley of a Parterre; which, though it would be out of Rule to plant it there, would betray a Want of Ta&s;te to root it out.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Paragraph of the fifteenth Epi&s;tle gives me an Opportunity of renewing my Remark upon one of the Epi&s;tles of the fir&s;t Volume:
<PB N="149" REF="150">
I forget which of them; and, as I have returned you that Book, I cannot &s;et my&s;elf right now; but it is where he comes very near preferring a Life of retired Lei&s;ure to public Bu&s;ine&s;s; but dares not &s;peak quite out, for the Rea&s;ons there mentioned.

<Q>I <HI>dare</HI> not &s;ay my Life would be better, but certainly it would be happier, if my Studies were my &s;ole Employments.</Q></P>

<Q>The Land it&s;elf will never want a Proprietor;</Q>

<P>On the nineteenth Epi&s;tle, <HI>Faulkner</HI> makes a remarkable Blunder in the Comment, about the Genealogy of <HI>Fannia</HI>; but, indeed, the whole Edition of this Book is very faulty.</P>
<P>In the Ob&s;ervations upon the twenty-fifth Epi&s;tle, my Lord quotes, as a Proverb, this Sentence:

Upon the whole, I have determined in the Negative, and &s;acri|ficed my Inclinations to my Prudence, upon this Rea&s;oning; that few Men can de&s;erve &s;uch high Honour, by their Merits; but almo&s;t any Man may appear not unworthy of it, by his Mode&s;ty. One particular Thing, which tempted me to write, was, the occurring of &s;ome farther Thoughts upon that comfortable Subject of the Mercy of God; which was Part of my Letter to her; and which I did not carry as far as I might, with a little Reflection, at that Time, le&s;t it &s;hould look like a premeditated E&s;&s;ay, what was, in Rea|lity, but an occa&s;ional Occurrence; though, after what Manner hinted to me, from any Part of my Letter, I cannot, at pre&s;ent, recollect.</P>
<P>The only Objection which Divines make to the unbounded Mercy of God, is his infinite Ju&s;tice; for, &s;ay they, Ju&s;tice is concerned about puni&s;hing the Wicked, as well as re|warding
<PB N="153" REF="154">
the Virtuous; and the only Scope they will allow to Mercy, is Remi&s;&s;ion upon Re|pentance.</P>
<P>Now let us con&s;ider the Matter impartially among our&s;elves; for ob&s;erve, there is nobody by, but you and I.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, it is high Pre&s;umption to pretend to rea&s;on about the Attributes of God; and all Definitions of this Kind may be con|&s;idered
<Q>like the Eye in Pro&s;pect, who&s;e, Strength can find no End; but Weakne&s;s makes one.</Q>
The Qualities and Faculties of the human Mind, from whence they vainly argue, may have (and it is more than probable) &s;o little Relation to the divine Mind, that there may not be even any Analogy between them; and may, perhaps, to a Spirit capable of con|ceiving both, be as different Ideas, as Sound and Colour.</P>
<P>But let us di&s;pute with them, upon their own Terms, and &s;peak of God as Man; and let us agree, for the Sake of Argument, that, though the Qualities of a human Creature certainly bear no Proportion to the Attributes, they may, however, have &s;uch a Relation to them as Time has to Eternity; and thus we may come to a clear Method of rea&s;oning upon this Subject.</P>
<P>Human Ju&s;tice then, as blended with human Pa&s;&s;ions and human Policies, may be defined a Retribution of Rewards and Puni&s;hments; but,
<PB N="154" REF="155">
to con&s;ider it in the Ab&s;tract, I do not think that even human Ju&s;tice comprehends the latter Part of this Definition; for Puni&s;hments are inflicted either to revenge or to deter. Now, with Regard to the fir&s;t, a Legi&s;lature is di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate; and, with Regard to the latter, I am &s;ure, that if a Man could commit any Crime, which it was impo&s;&s;ible for him, or any body el&s;e, ever to commit again, it would be a Cru|elty to allot any Penalty for it; becau&s;e, in this Ca&s;e, the Benefit of the Example would never operate. In this State, then, I look upon our Souls in the next World; as having committed Offences, which we can no longer repeat, and the Puni&s;hment of which can then no more avail us, or &s;erve as a whole&s;ome Example, to deter others; nor is God a Man, that he &s;hould be angry.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not add any thing farther upon this Head, but ju&s;t to ob&s;erve to you, that the De|finition of Mercy, as it is given in the Beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e, ab&s;olutely annihilates the Virtue, by making it only Part of another; for Forgivene&s;s, upon Repentance, is not a di&s;tinct Operation, according to that Sen&s;e; but merely a Piece of Ju&s;tice. If I forgive my Debtor, he is obliged to my Genero&s;ity: But, if he pays the Debt, he relea&s;es him&s;elf; and I but perform common Equity, by giving up his Obligation, upon Conditions performed. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<P>THE un&s;ettled, and, of Cour&s;e, uncom|fortable Situation I have been in, the&s;e three Months, makes me feel a very &s;incere Satisfaction at being able to date this Letter from my own Apartment, or, rather, your's; for I cannot, will not call it mine, 'till you have ble&s;t it with your Pre&s;ence. Ha&s;te, then, my deare&s;t Life, my kinde&s;t Love, my All, my Being, ha&s;te, and re&s;tore your <HI>Fanny</HI> to the En|joyment of her&s;elf in you! bring to her Wi&s;hes, to her Tran&s;ports bring all that can make Mor|tality endured, and render Immortality &s;till more de&s;irable!</P>
<P>The Impatience of my fond De&s;ire to &s;ee you, has hurried my Imagination into a Kind of Rhap&s;ody; but I own I &s;hould think it a Crime to love you after the common, &s;ober, in&s;ipid Manner; and, if Exce&s;s of Love be pardonable in any Woman, I may &s;tand ex|cu&s;ed. My Con&s;titution is naturally cold; nor could it be warmed into Love by an Object le&s;s worthy, than my Heart's dear <HI>Harry.</HI> This Declaration, which is, indeed, a true one, may well &s;ecure you from any Fear of Change in my Heart: I wi&s;h, both for your Sake and my
<PB N="156" REF="157">
own, that I had Merits &s;ufficient to furni&s;h me with the &s;ame Security. But, as your Love and Con&s;tancy outweigh even your other Merits to me, I will re&s;t &s;atisfied, from my Dependence on them, though con&s;cious of my Want of Worth to de&s;erve them, in any other Way, but by returning them an hundred-fold.</P>
<P>I cannot help &s;aying, I am &s;orry the Corre|&s;pondence, between Lady &mdash; and you, is at an End; though, I am certain, you judged it right.</P>
<P>Though we can have no perfect Knowledge of the Attributes of God, I cannot think it Pre|&s;umption to form an Idea, according to our finite Capacity, that he is ju&s;t and merciful. If we believe the Bible to be a Work of In&s;pira|tion, we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ent to this Opinion. If we con&s;ider it as the Work of mere Man, un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted, unin&s;pired, it appears, that the Re&s;ult of natural Rea&s;on, as far as <HI>finite</HI> can compre|hend <HI>infinite,</HI> has given us an Idea both of the Almighty and his Attributes; and &s;ure it cannot be criminal to employ that Rea&s;on, which he hath be&s;towed upon us, in Contemplation of his Excellence. The Fault, which I think the Generality of Men, and particularly Divines, run into, is not the Rea&s;oning on the divine Attributes, but daring to &s;et Bounds to what their poor finite Capacities cannot comprehend. &mdash;I cannot, by any Means, agree with you,
<PB N="157" REF="158">
that it is probable there &s;hould be no Analogy between the divine and human Mind. We believe God to be all-wi&s;e, all-good. We mu&s;t change the Idea of the&s;e Attributes into Folly and Cruelty, if we &s;uppo&s;ed he did not form the Faculties of our Souls by the mo&s;t perfect Model&mdash;by him&s;elf; though he confined their Operation within a narrow Sphere. But when we &s;hall put off this frail Mortality, that now clogs and inclo&s;es the Faculties of our Souls, I do believe they will be enlarged; and of what U&s;e could they be, had they no Analogy to the divine Being, in the Contemplation of who&s;e endle&s;s Glory and Perfection our chief Happine&s;s will, I pre&s;ume, con&s;i&s;t?</P>
<P>I am quite charmed with your Argument for unbounded Mercy. I think it is carried as far as finite Wi&s;dom can go; and, to make u&s;e of your own Expre&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome other Place.</NOTE>, has &s;hewn, that
<Q>God is not made up of Parts, but is <HI>one</HI> perfect Being,</Q>
who&s;e Attributes co-operate and cor|re&s;pond together.</P>
<P>In Compliance with your often-repeated De|&s;ire, you &s;ee I have ventured to touch upon a Subject infinitely beyond my Capacity; but it is in &s;uch a Manner, as Boys fir&s;t learn to &s;wim; con&s;cious I am out of my Depth, and afraid of drowning every In&s;tant: But my dear Teacher

<P>I AM much alarmed about your Di&s;order, and extremely concerned at it. For Heaven's Sake take Care of your&s;elf. Go early to Bed, though you lie awake three Hours after it; and get up early, though you &s;hould be obliged to do&s;e in the Middle of the Day for it. Con&s;ider, my Heart's Pa&s;&s;ion, my Mind's Reflection, my Life's Happine&s;s, and my Soul's Hope, that all the&s;e precious Concerns depend upon you, and are employed about you. If I had a more fa|vourite Scheme in View, than your Felicity, or imagined to my&s;elf any Tran&s;port, but through that Means, you might then, perhaps, be at Liberty to trifle away your Time and Health, upon Per&s;ons who have neither Sen&s;e or Ta&s;te enough to conceive your Merits, nor Tender|ne&s;s or Love to be affected by them. Re|member now, my warme&s;t Wi&s;h, that I tru&s;t you with your&s;elf; and &s;urely the high Confi|dence of &s;o dear a Pledge de&s;erves, at lea&s;t, that it &s;hall not be impaired in your Keeping.</P>
<P>Since you do not approve of my Epitaphs, I beg you will frame others more to your Fancy; or, rather, let the Actions of our Lives form the

Mottos for our Graves. It was finely &s;aid of <HI>Socrates,</HI> when called upon by his Judges to make his Defence,
<Q>I have been doing nothing el&s;e all my Life.</Q>
<HI>Montaigne</HI> ob&s;erves, very ju&s;tly, upon the Subject of Death,
<Q>that the Philo&s;ophy of the Schools but increa&s;es, by Prepen&s;ity, the Terrors of it; and only pre|pares us for the Preparation.</Q>
What &s;ignifies all the Sophi&s;try deduced from the Con&s;idera|tion of the Mortality of our State, that we had Life it&s;elf but upon the&s;e Conditions,
<Q>that Death, a nece&s;&s;ary End, will come when it will come?</Q>
with other Quibbles of the &s;ame Kind.&mdash;The only Way to make ready for Death, is to prepare our Lives for it. Actions, not Words, can comfort us at &s;uch a Cri&s;is.</P>
<P>After &s;o &s;olemn a Subject as this, it may ap|pear light to mention &s;uch a Trifle, as I am going to &s;peak of, but that, in Truth, though I expect to be laughed at, I have &s;ome Scruples of Con&s;cience about it. There is a Butterfly in my Study, which would be dead &s;ome Time pa&s;t, but that I watched it, at the End of the Sea&s;on, and have frequently revived it by the Warmth of my Breath, every Day &s;ince; and you cannot conceive the Plea&s;ure I receive, when I feel it flutter in my Hand, upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions. By this Means I have prolonged it's Life beyond the Date of Butterflies. Now perhaps I am coun|teracting the Order of Providence, and may

de&s;erve the Puni&s;hment of <HI>Promotheus,</HI> for &s;teal|ing Fire from Heaven, to animate his Man of Clay: Perhaps too, I am but making this poor In&s;ect linger out a Life in Pain; for I believe no Creature, but Man, ever received Plea&s;ure from any thing which was contrary to Nature. In &s;hort, I begin to fancy I am guilty of &s;uch a Cruelty, as the keeping a Man awake all Night, by Way of adding &s;o many Hours to his Day. Should any Phy&s;ician di&s;cover an Elixir, which might equal our Lives to the Age of the Pa|triarchs, would he not de&s;erve to have his own cut &s;hort, for tempting Men to cheat them&s;elves of &s;ome Portion of a glorious Immortality, merely to lengthen out &s;ome Years of Mi&s;ery, here below? The Gymno&s;ophi&s;ts have a fine Sentiment; that we are, in this Life, but in a State of <HI>Conception</HI>; and that Death is our <HI>De|livery.</HI> A Man, then, who has lived beyond the Bounds pre&s;cribed by Nature, may, perhaps, be con&s;idered, in the next Life, as a mon&s;trous <HI>Birth.</HI> For my Part, I de&s;ire not to die before the ordinary Fate of human Nature; but, at the &s;ame Time, wi&s;h, with <HI>Horace,</HI>

<P>Though I object, from &s;elfi&s;h Views, to my dear <HI>Harry</HI>'s Love of Solitude, I perfectly agree with him in thinking the Generality of People and Conver&s;ations, we meet with, to be mo&s;tly di&s;agreeable; at be&s;t, trifling and in&s;ipid, and quite incapable of affording that Delight, which &s;hould ari&s;e from the Conver&s;e of rational and immortal Beings; yet do I think Life would become irk&s;ome, and every Virtue &s;tagnate in our Souls, were they not called into Action by a De&s;ire of being approved by &s;ome particular Per&s;on.

<P>I SEND you, inclo&s;ed, the Cover of your la&s;t Letter, which you &s;ee was &s;ent without a Seal. Through what Peru&s;als it has pa&s;&s;ed I cannot &s;ay; but am glad it has e&s;caped the <HI>Cotton</HI> Library of Manu&s;cripts, to arrive &s;afe to my Hands, at la&s;t.</P>
<P>You have no Rea&s;on to apprehend, that my Fondne&s;s for Retirement can ever &s;eclude you from my Society: That Ta&s;te, or Turn of Mind, which gives me a Di&s;reli&s;h to Conver&s;a|tion in general, does but create in me a &s;tronger Impatience for the Enjoyment of your's in par|ticular. I own that my Pa&s;&s;ion for Solitude has grown very &s;trong in me of late; but mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that I &s;hould chu&s;e to carry it no farther, than to that ble&s;&s;ed State, which <HI>Adam</HI> rejoiced in, between the la&s;t Creation and his Fall:
<Q><HI>Adam</HI> relating, &s;he &s;ole Auditre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>I agree with you, that the Approbation we expect from virtuous Actions, is a very high In|citement to them; and the Love of Fame, &s;o &s;trongly implanted in all Mankind, has always appeared to me a very good Proof of the Soul's Exi&s;tence after Death, even of it's eternal Exi&s;tence: For, as this is a Pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="167" REF="168">
which nothing le&s;s than Immortality can gratify, it would be impiou&s;ly charging Providence with in&s;piring us with a De&s;ire, which we were never de&s;igned to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Enjoyment of, were we to exclude the Hope of an Hereafter.</P>
<P>As the Immortality of the Soul, and the Ex|i&s;tence of a God, have been often made u&s;e of, as reciprocal Proofs, I &s;hall add a few Words, upon this la&s;t Subject, to the many excellent Arguments, more at large in&s;i&s;ted upon by the Divines. If Infidels, or Sceptics, deny, or doubt the Certainty of an intelligent Providence, yet &s;urely the Belief of it ought to be received, as we give Credit to the <HI>Copernican</HI> Sy&s;tem; if not for it's Demon&s;tration, at lea&s;t, becau&s;e this Hypothe&s;is accounts for all the Phaenomena of the cele&s;tial Bodies; which would otherwi&s;e ap|pear a Heap of wild Incoherence: And ra&s;hly to deny a Thing, becau&s;e we cannot compre|hend it, is &s;uch a Pyrrhoni&s;m, as to affirm we cannot &s;ee, becau&s;e we are not &s;ufficiently in|formed how we &s;ee: For to &s;ay we &s;ee by our Eyes, is unphilo&s;ophical; for our Eyes are but the Organs of Sight; that is, the In&s;trument, not the Cau&s;e. In looking up through the Chain of Effects, our Rea&s;on he&s;itates at a cer|tain Period, which we pre&s;ume to be the fir&s;t Cau&s;e; though, beyond our Comprehen&s;ion, the Links may be infinite, before they reach the fir&s;t Cau&s;e; and, then, to &s;ay we cannot com|prehend
<PB N="168" REF="169">
that fir&s;t Cau&s;e, is but a Sort of Defi|nition of it; for, if we could comprehend it, it could not be what we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince you attacked me &s;o well upon my Hint, that, perhaps, there was as little Analogy, as Compari&s;on, between the Virtues of Man, and the Attributes of God, I have been re|volving that Subject in my Mind; for we &s;hould have Rea&s;ons, even for our Doubts, in &s;o high a Matter; and, the more I con&s;ider it, the more am I confirmed in an Opinion, which was but a Surmi&s;e, at fir&s;t. If we &s;tick to the Religion of Nature, we can, indeed, only &s;ay, perhaps there may be no Relation between them; but when we come down to Revelation, we &s;hall find many expre&s;s Authorities to &s;up|port my Argument; two of which I think &s;uf|ficient to produce. What Notions of Ju&s;tice can the human Mind &s;upply us with, for the Cur&s;e derived to all Mankind from original Sin? Then, again, Part of the &s;econd Cammandment &s;ays,
<Q>I will vi&s;it the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children, to the third and fourth Genera|tion of them that hate me,</Q>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> What human Equity is there in this? Is not the Crime of hating God, in the proper Sen&s;e of that Expre&s;|&s;ion, &s;ufficient to incur the Puni&s;hments de|nounced again&s;t the Wicked, without involving us in our Parent's Guilt? Perhaps it was from &s;uch In&s;tances as the&s;e in Scripture, that the
<PB N="169" REF="170">
Papi&s;ts have deduced their ab&s;urd Doctrine of Supererogation; for, if we are to be damned by another's Sin, it may be rea&s;onably implied, that we may be &s;aved by another's Merits. Upon the whole, I &s;hall conclude with another Pa&s;&s;age from the Scriptures,

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED no Letter from you la&s;t Po&s;t, and cannot know whether I &s;hall hear from you by this, 'till I return To-morrow to &mdash;. It was unkind in you to neglect writing, when you knew how unea&s;y I mu&s;t be to have &s;ome Account of your Health. I &s;aw <HI>Kitty</HI> Ye&s;terday, who heard from &s;ome of her Friends; and, by not mentioning you, I hope this Omi&s;&s;ion was not owing to your Di&s;order.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="171">I had a wild Night of it, coming here, and have not been &s;o wet, &s;ince I was la&s;t in the River. I had no Cloaths with me, but what I had on my Back; &s;o I have betaken my&s;elf to my Bed; from whence I am now writing to you, and drinking your Health, and my own too, in Milk-Whey. My kind Landlady, who is al&s;o my Tenant, upon Notice of my coming here To-day, has wa&s;hed my Sheets in the Morning, and my Room in the Evening, to make me welcome.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved an extraordinary Phaenomenon, as I came along. The Night was extremely dark, and the Rain fell exce&s;&s;ively: Notwith&s;tanding which, the whole Mountain, I rode over, &s;eemed to be on Fire, with &s;uch an ember Light, as is &s;een after the Blaze of a Bonfire is gone out. I a&s;ked my Guide the Meaning of it, (whom I hired at the Foot of the Hill,) and he told me, that all the heathy Grounds here|abouts have this Appearance, by Night. This is certainly a very great natural Curio&s;ity; but what I never ob&s;erved, or heard of before. If this were real Fire, it might put this Part of the Country into a terrible Combu&s;tion, as the Collieries happen to meet in the Center of the&s;e Hills.</P>
<P>This Thought led me in&s;en&s;ibly on to the Con&s;ideration of the general Conflagration, which is prophe&s;ied in Scripture; and which
<PB N="171" REF="172">
our Faith makes us expect, at a certain Period, from &s;ome extraordinary Act of divine Power; but which I never heard accounted for, from the Philo&s;ophy of Nature, as it &s;tands at pre&s;ent. I &s;hall therefore amu&s;e you, and my&s;elf, with an Hypothe&s;is for this Purpo&s;e; and may, &s;ometime or other, hereafter, refer it to wi&s;er Heads than ours, whether there be any real Weight in this whim&s;ical Opinion of mine, or no.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t fir&s;t give your a &s;hort Account of A&s;tronomy. This Globe of Earth, as well as all the Planets of our &s;olar Sy&s;tem, revolves about the Sun; which Rotation is effected from the compounding of two different Powers; the <HI>Centripetal,</HI> which is the common Gravity of Bodies, that mutually attract each other, and, if acting alone, would occa&s;ion the Earth to be &s;wallowed up by the Sun; and the <HI>Centrifugal,</HI> which is a Force impul&s;ed upon all the Planets, at their Creation, that directs them forward, in a right Line, and, if not counteracted by the fir&s;t Power, would propel the Body on, through in|finite Space, to all Eternity. Now both the&s;e Powers acting, by the almighty Oeconomy, upon our Earth, at the &s;ame Time, occa&s;ion a Motion compounded of both the&s;e Cau&s;es; every Revolution of which is performed in that Period of Time, that is called a Year. From what I have &s;aid it is plain, that, if the <HI>Centrifugal</HI> Power was taken away, the Earth mu&s;t ru&s;h
<PB N="172" REF="173">
into the Sun, and &s;o be de&s;troyed by Fire. But this would be a particular Act of the Almighty; and my Philo&s;ophy is to explain the Po&s;&s;ibility and Probability of this Effect, by plain and natural Means; which I apprehend may be occa&s;ioned by increa&s;ing the Weight of the Earth, and con|&s;equently it's gravitating Powers: For I think natural Philo&s;ophers agree, that Bodies attract, in Proportion to their Quantity of Matter; which, at a certain Degree, will make the <HI>Cen|tripetal</HI> overcome the <HI>Centrifugal</HI> Force. Now my Opinion is, that every living Creature, Man, Brute, In&s;ect, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which has been produced &s;ince the Creation, has made an Addition of &s;o much Matter to the Earth, as it's Weight came to at it's Birth. The Increa&s;e of Bulk, during it's Life, I make no Account of, becau&s;e that proceeds from the Con&s;umption of the Fruits of the Earth, which drawing their Nouri&s;hment from the Earth it&s;elf, alters only the Form, not the &s;pecific Gravity; but that Weight, which the Creature brings into the World, is certainly an Addition, becau&s;e the Parent neither eats or drinks more, to bring the Foetus to Perfection, than if &s;he were not pregnant; and, if tried in Scales, would be found to be of equal Weight, before, and after&mdash;except in the Ca&s;e of Sickne&s;s, or hard Labour; neither of which is the natural Con&s;equence of Procreation; as may be ob&s;erved from Brutes, and other Ani|mals;
<PB N="173" REF="174">
and from the Generality of the human Species too, who have not weakened or de|bauched their natural Forces by Luxury, Effe|minacy, or Exce&s;s. I have no Library here, &s;o mu&s;t be excu&s;ed, if I am not as full, and as correct, upon this Subject, as I might be, if I were among my Books: But I always write to you in the &s;ame loo&s;e Manner that Things occur to my Mind at fir&s;t Thought; and often but ju&s;t enter down Hints, to &s;upply us with Topics for Conver&s;ation, when we are together.</P>
<P>I am particularly plea&s;ed at this Hypothe&s;is pre&s;enting it&s;elf to my Reflection; as the ex|planation of any Prophecy, by natural Means, is a &s;tronger Motive to our Belief, than the mere Faith of it, from a Miracle. Now the De&s;truction of the World by Fire was de|nounced, as I apprehend, long before the Laws of A&s;tronomy, or the Gravitation of Matter, was &s;ufficiently known, to authorize &s;uch an Hypothe&s;is as this; and, as I am not quite or|thodox in&s;ome Points, I own that I heartily re|joice, when I can make Amends in others; and, in rea&s;oning about Religion, or contemplating the Ways of Providence, I think we ought, in a &s;tronger and more particular Manner, to apply an Ob&s;ervation, which I remember out of <HI>Lon|ginus:</HI> That, in the reading of <HI>Homer, Plato,</HI> or any of tho&s;e precious Spirits of Antiquity, when any Pa&s;&s;ages occur, to which we cannot readily
<PB N="174" REF="175">
reconcile our Rea&s;on, we ought firmly to be|lieve that, were tho&s;e great Genii pre&s;ent to explain them&s;elves, we &s;hould, to our Confu&s;ion, be convinced, that we only were guilty of tho&s;e Errors, which we blindly charged upon them.</P>
<P>I think I may now lay my&s;elf down to &s;leep, e&s;teeming this E&s;&s;ay in the Place of a Prayer: And may I have the Ble&s;&s;ing of it in my Dreams, by meeting you there in perfect Health!</P>

<P>NO Words can expre&s;s the di&s;tracted Situa|tion of my Mind, nor give you any Idea of the ill Treatment I have received from &mdash;. Indeed, neither my Health nor Spirits can hold out much longer: But I will do all I can to &s;upport my&s;elf under the complicated Pains of Body and Mind, which I at pre&s;ent feel, 'till I &s;ee you; then gladly part with them and Life together.

I know you will condemn me for letting my Spirits &s;ink; but, as you do not know the Cau&s;e, let not my &s;weet Love judge too har&s;hly from the Effects.

Yet &s;till, as a frail Mortal, I cannot help feeling I am hurt, and complaining to you (though I do not re|pine); for
<Q>Sighs, and Cries, by Nature, grow on Pain.</Q></P>
<P>Your Account of your Journey to &mdash;, and Manner of lying there, has made me va&s;tly unea&s;y.

They &s;ay &s;he died in Child-bed. It is very po&s;&s;ible tho&s;e Barbarians, &s;he was among, have murdered her&mdash;vile Wretches!

<P>YOUR Letter of the 9th has given me a great deal of Concern. Repre&s;ent your Si|tuation particularly to Lady &mdash;; for to me you have &s;poken only in general Terms; and &s;trictly follow her friendly and con&s;iderate Advice. My Fortunes &s;hall be your's, &s;o u&s;e them freely; and that I did not offer this before, was from a Regard to your Character, which I have very nice and hone&s;t Rea&s;ons to be tender of.

In &s;hort, I am &s;uch an Adventurer in this World, that, if I have Luck, there's nothing in it; and if not, no Oeconomy can &s;ave my Fortune. A Year's Indu&s;try will not make me rich; but a Minute's Reflection can reconcile me to Po|verty. The utmo&s;t Diligence can but e&s;tabli&s;h that Fund, which may be thought nece&s;&s;ary to this Life, and which <HI>Socrates</HI> or <HI>Pliny</HI> needs not, at pre&s;ent: But let us cultivate that Trea&s;ure, which will &s;upply us to Eternity, and may help us to bear a Part with tho&s;e precious Spirits, who are happy before us.</P>
<P>Your Sentiment is both philo&s;ophic and re|ligious, "that your pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s may produce your future Happine&s;s." <HI>Socrates</HI> &s;aid, he owed all his Philo&s;ophy to his Wife. Every Man &s;hould endeavour to be a Philo&s;opher, not &s;o much to &s;upport him&s;elf in Death, as to be able to endure Life; and, when Misfortunes or Mor|tifications come upon us, in&s;tead of repining, we &s;hould thank Providence for the lucky Occa&s;ions of exerci&s;ing that Virtue. A wretched Man has greater Scope for Virtue, than a happy Man; and a poor Man, than a rich.</P>

<P>I SENT off an Expre&s;s to &mdash;, and reco|vered your Letter of the third. I return you Lady &mdash;'s Letter, which is very kind. You cannot imagine what Plea&s;ure your &s;aying &s;he &s;tays here for the Winter has given me. It is a very lucky, as well as plea&s;ing Circum|&s;tance for you, at this particular Time; which is enough to &s;hew you, how happy this Account has made me. <GAP DESC="blank"></P>
<P>I &s;hall go to Town in the Beginning of the Term; but am extremely unea&s;y to know what is the Meaning of the Hint, you gave me in your la&s;t Letter,
<Q>that you have &s;omething to &s;ay to me, which you will not mention, 'till we meet.</Q>
I beg, my <HI>Fanny,</HI> you will explain your&s;elf by next Po&s;t.</P>
<P>I am now returned to <HI>Montaigne,</HI> which I quitted for <HI>Pliny,</HI> at your Reque&s;t; and I make it a Rule to give you my Ob&s;ervations upon every Book I read.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182">In his Hi&s;tory of the three mo&s;t excellent Men, he names <HI>Homer, Alexander,</HI> and <HI>Epaminondas.</HI> By Excellence, here, he &s;eems merely to con|&s;ider this Expre&s;&s;ion, with regard to Fame only: But I think he has not, as one might expect, given us Examples from different Cla&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t is a Poet, the &s;econd a Soldier, and &s;o is the third, when I expected a Philo&s;opher; and here I would name <HI>Plato,</HI> or better, <HI>Socrates:</HI> But perhaps <HI>Montaigne</HI> con&s;idered <HI>Epaminondas</HI> in this Cla&s;s, and in the highe&s;t Degree, as he is recorded to have practi&s;ed what others only teach.</P>
<P><HI>Montaigne</HI> makes a good Defence for repre&s;ent|ing human Nature not much to it's Advantage; as, in general, the <HI>French</HI> Writers are apt to do: "Others make Men, I but report them."</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed to find he had &s;ome of my Whims: He mentions one, which, you may remember, I &s;ometimes hinted to you; of taking a particular Fancy to &s;ome one Gla&s;s laid down at Table, though of equal Dimen&s;ions with the re&s;t, out of which I often take a greater Plea&s;ure in drinking; nay, I have gone &s;o far, once or twice, as to pay a Man's Club for the Exchange of his Gla&s;s. Whence &s;uch Caprices, as this, proceed, I do not remember that any of the Expo&s;itors upon human Nature have accounted; and I think it would be an ingenious and amu&s;ing Subject to inquire into.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="183">This puts me in Mind of a Theme, I have a great Mind to recommend for a Premium to the Society of <HI>Dijon,</HI> in <HI>France</HI>; which is an E&s;&s;ay upon <HI>Metaphorical Ta&s;te</HI>; being a Liking, or Admiration, not confined to, or deducible from, the e&s;tabli&s;hed Rules of Beauty, Harmony, Order, or Truth, which &s;hould be the natural or rational Foundations of our Approbation. Why is the Mind of Man, when endued with what is called Ta&s;te, delighted with extravagant Flights in Poetry, extraordinary Metaphors, Ex|ce&s;&s;es in Grammar, Chromatics in Mu&s;ic, <HI>&amp;c?</HI> How come we to be charmed with Things, which offend common Sen&s;e, or &s;hock the natural Ear? And from what Turn of Caprice does it proceed, that the very Errors and Faults of &s;ome of the Arts and Sciences are e&s;teemed as Beauties? Nay, to &s;hew that Ta&s;te is not only above, but even &s;ometimes aver&s;e from rational Admiration, we need but recollect the Plea&s;ure we receive from viewing &s;ome of the Deformities of Nature, as Rocks, Precipices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and at the &s;ame Time remember, that we are &s;en&s;ible of a certain Horror, during the Contemplation.</P>
<P>Have you &s;een that Piece, which carried the la&s;t Premium at <HI>Dijon,</HI> upon this The&s;is, Whe|ther the Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Arts and Sciences has contributed to the Refinement of Manners? I have read it, and like the Side of the Que&s;tion
<PB N="183" REF="184">
he has cho&s;en, by denying it. I think, the Subject might have been handled more at large, and to better Advantage, than the Author has done there.
<Q><L>Quid juvat innumeros &s;cire atque evolvere Ca&s;us,</L>
<L>Si fugienda facis, et facienda fugis?</L></Q>
What does it import us to know the Springs of Good and Ill, while we do tho&s;e Things, which we ought not to have done, and leave undone tho&s;e Things, which we ought to have done? I have not yet &s;een the An&s;wer to it; but, when I have, I &s;hall probably determine the Di&s;pute like Sir <HI>Roger de Coverley,</HI> by concluding "that much may be &s;aid on both Sides."</P>
<P>What the <HI>Genevan</HI> &s;ays of Learning with regard to Morals, I have often &s;aid of it with regard to Under&s;tanding &mdash; That it has &s;o over|loaded the Mind of Man, that, like too full a Stomach, the dige&s;tive Powers have not Room to exert them&s;elves; or it has confined our Reflections, by &s;etting Bounds to our Inquiries, or given us a Bia&s;s out of the right Road, by obliging us to think too much after one another, and following in a beaten Track. When Rea&s;on attempts to exerci&s;e her&s;elf in the Mind of the Learned, &s;he finds it, like a Storehou&s;e, &s;o filled with the old Trumpery of the Antients, that &s;he has hardly Room to &s;tretch her Limbs. I am for recurring up to the Original of all
<PB N="184" REF="185">
Things, and drinking Truth at the Fountain-head; not quenching my Thir&s;t of Knowledge in polluted Streams. Rivers, in pa&s;&s;ing through populous Cities, acquire indeed a Softne&s;s and a Richne&s;s, but lo&s;e the Sweetne&s;s and Purity, which they brought from their Spring. If you want to inform your&s;elf of Art or Science, withdraw to your Study; if of Truth or Nature, retire within your&s;elf. Reading &s;hould be your Exerci&s;e, but Reflection your Study. Sen&s;e is a Bottle of E&s;&s;ence, which lo&s;es it's Strength by Dilatation; or like a Wedge of Gold, which, hammered into Plates, or drawn into Wire, extends it's Dimen&s;ions, but weakens it's Sub&s;tance.</P>

<P><PB N="187" REF="188">The Rea&s;on of applying tho&s;e philo&s;ophic Lectures, which you are offended at, was from this Blunder: That I thought the Lo&s;s of Health, Fortune, Friends, or any other Unhappine&s;s of Life, was the proper Sea&s;on to recommend &s;uch Medicines; and it ought to be ob&s;erved, I did not u&s;e &s;uch Reflections to &s;hew how <HI>I</HI> could bear your Misfortunes, but to in&s;truct and a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>you</HI> to &s;upport your&s;elf under them. He, who would comfort another, comes not, as I appre|hended, with Sighs and Groans.</P>
<P>I &s;hall never, upon any Occa&s;ion, trouble you with more of my Philo&s;ophy, but &s;hall always cheri&s;h it in my Heart; becau&s;e, at this Time, it &s;tands your Friend, and helps me to conclude my&s;elf, as u&s;ual,</P>

<P>I RETURN you Lady &mdash;'s Letter, and am plea&s;ed to find, that you &s;till hold on a Corre&s;pondence with her. I love her for rallying your Spirits. I am a&s;hamed for my <HI>Fanny,</HI> with two &s;uch philo&s;ophic Friends, to be &s;o ca&s;t down. She &s;eems to &s;olicit your writing often to her,
<PB N="188" REF="189">
which &s;urely I need not intreat you to obey; but &s;hall only leave you more at Liberty to do &s;o, by letting you know, that, if Time pre&s;&s;es, I will take your having wrote to her, as a &s;ufficient Apology for your leaving me to hunt through the Stores of Antiquity for &s;omething to amu&s;e me, in the room of tho&s;e Letters you neglect to me. How much do I regard your Advantage, before my own Plea&s;ure? And for any Favour, &s;he can ever do me, I thus pay the Price before-hand.</P>
<P>I thank you for your kind Sentiments with Regard to pa&s;&s;ing your Time with me; and it is certain that tho&s;e Portions of Life, which we &s;pend agreeably to our&s;elves, are all that can be computed in a Philo&s;opher's Kalendar. I am plea&s;ed with the Epitaph, which <HI>Similis,</HI> a General under <HI>Adrian,</HI> directed to be in&s;cribed on his Tomb-&s;tone. He had &s;pent a long Life in Perils and Fatigues, 'till about &s;even Years before his Death; when he retired to his Villa, pa&s;&s;ing his Time as became a Man of Religion, Sen&s;e, and Philo&s;ophy. The <HI>Latin</HI> is,
<Q>Hic jacet <HI>Similis,</HI> cujus Aetas multorum Annorum &s;uit: Ip&s;e &s;eptem duntaxat Annos vixit.</Q>
I will attempt the Tran&s;lation for you:
<Q><L>My Life, O Time! to many Years amount,</L>
<L>But &s;even only make my own Account.</L></Q>
For my Part, I have made three Divi&s;ions of my Time; and, according to the Di&s;tinctions
<PB N="189" REF="190">
I make, there are but two Portions of them to be attributed to my Life. When I am in Company, I <HI>pa&s;s</HI> my Time; when I am alone, I <HI>&s;pend</HI> it; and, while I am with you, I <HI>enjoy</HI> it.</P>
<P>Since the Election at &mdash;, I have had the Happine&s;s to be entirely alone; which the Hurry, I was then in, has given me a thorough Reli&s;h for. I do not think it ami&s;s to con&s;ider the World as a Pri&s;on; where we are &s;ubject to &s;uch Company, as Chance, Nece&s;&s;ity, Vice, or Misfortune, have a&s;&s;ociated us with: And Soli|tude may be deemed the true Siege of Freedom; as there alone we can be Ma&s;ters of Our&s;elves, our Time, and Occupations. The only Thing, in which I think <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> attempted to be great, was his Wi&s;h to live, to retire; but he was never great enough to execute that noble Sen|timent. It is &s;omewhere &s;aid, that
<Q>Privacy and Freedom is the Wi&s;h of the Great, but the Privilege of the Mean.</Q>
The Life, I lead at pre&s;ent, is certainly the End propo&s;ed of all the Labours and Perils of the Great, in all States of Life; then what a true, philo&s;ophic Plea&s;ure mu&s;t a Man be &s;en&s;ible of, who has reached this Goal, without being out of Breath for it! while he looks back, with Compa&s;&s;ion, upon Millions, who are &s;weating and toiling, ca&s;ting away Pomps, Fa&s;ces, and Fortune, to make them&s;elves light for the Race, and &s;houl|dering through oppo&s;ing Crouds, to come up
<PB N="190" REF="191">
to him! What the Philo&s;opher <HI>Cyneas</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> might be here applied, but that I hate Quotations; however, I &s;hall give you one: <HI>Diogenes</HI> &s;aid, that
<Q><HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> mu&s;t go to Din|ner, when <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Bell rung; but <HI>he</HI> was at Liberty to wait for the Summons of his Appetite.</Q>
In the World, we are obliged to act by Rule; but, in Retirement, we can act according to Rea&s;on.</P>

<P>I AM much obliged to my dear <HI>Harry</HI> for the Indulgence he is &s;o kind to grant me: I have a much better Right to plead that Privilege, at pre&s;ent, than I can ever have from writing to Lady &mdash;, or any other Per&s;on; which is my being utterly incapable of writing, from real Illne&s;s. I have been all Day on the Bed; and, though I ventured to <HI>Bond-Street,</HI> in hopes of rouzing my Spirits, I find my&s;elf &s;o very weak and languid, that I am hardly able to hold the Pen. I have had a &s;evere Fit of the Rheumati&s;m in my Arm; which, joined to a con&s;tant Cough,
<PB N="191" REF="192">
prevents my &s;leeping an Hour at a Time, the whole Night.</P>
<P>I am a&s;hamed of living a con&s;tant Com|plainant. I think, it would be but decent in me to die; for, indeed, I am quite weary of Life: But
<Q>Death comes not at Call, nor mends his &s;lowe&s;t Pace for Plaints or Cries.</Q></P>
<P>I am extremely glad you are &s;o happy in your Retirement. I would by no means have you quit it, for the tumultuous Haunts of bu&s;y, idle Men. Let me, at lea&s;t, have the Satisfaction of thinking you are well, and well plea&s;ed; which is the only Thing on Earth, that can give real Plea&s;ure to my deare&s;t Life's own &s;ick</P>

<P>I SENT to the Po&s;t Ye&s;terday, but had no Letter from you; which I &s;hould have been extremely unea&s;y at, but that <HI>Kitty</HI> &s;ent me on&punc; from you to her, which does not &s;ay you are wor&s;e, though you &s;till complain. I came over here, ju&s;t after I wrote la&s;t to you, and break|fa&s;ted with <HI>Kitty</HI> in my Way. This was but the &s;econd Time I have &s;een her, &s;ince you left her; which &s;he &s;eems picqued at, and complains
<PB N="192" REF="193">
that I am grown peevi&s;h; for &s;he is one of tho&s;e, who cannot di&s;tingui&s;h between Gravity and Ill-humour, or knows any Difference between Reproof and Scolding.</P>
<P>I enjoy as much Solitude here, as I did lately at <HI>Belvidere</HI>; and live after my own Manner, which is, not to dine 'till Night. I am more the Hermit here too, which makes &s;ome Variety; for I dre&s;s my own Meals, broil my Chops, and roa&s;t my Potatoes, by my Chamber Fire; for I chu&s;e them clean; and they are but flatternly People, who rent this Hou&s;e from me, though they are <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and Prote&s;tants. I do a&s;&s;ure you, my Life, that I grudge my&s;elf every Mor&s;el I eat in this or any Retirement, unenjoyed by thee; and would very chearfully fa&s;t three Days, for the Plea&s;ure of your dining with me the fourth.</P>
<P>As I have a Way of philo&s;ophizing upon even the mo&s;t trifling Occa&s;ions, I have begun to look upon Epicuri&s;m in a very different Light, from what I have always con&s;idered it. It is certain, that the Epicure has a greater and more frequent Enjoyment of Life, than a Man of vulgar Appetite. I grant, that the reducing our Wants to as few Things as po&s;&s;ible, has more of the Philo&s;opher in it; but, perhaps, to multiply our Plea&s;ures may be the more &s;en&s;ible Scheme, within the Bounds of Rea&s;on and Innocence. They, who argue again&s;t this Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="193" REF="194">
may, from the &s;ame Rule, prohibit a refined Ta&s;te for Letters, Painting, or Mu&s;ic. But, though they &s;hould indulge us a little in (what they call) rational Plea&s;ures, they will find, that all their vain Philo&s;ophy again&s;t the Enjoyments of Sen&s;e, is but a certain Stoical Pride, which would pretend to &s;et human Nature above any Satisfaction, which they may have in common with Brutes. I wonder, they have not yet at|tempted to &s;top our Breath and Motion, becau&s;e Brutes have both.</P>
<P>I am, my deare&s;t Life, while I have Appetite, Breath, or Motion, your own rational Brute.</P>

<P>AS I know it will give my &s;weet Love Plea&s;ure, I find a very &s;incere one in being able to acquaint him, that I am va&s;tly better, than when I wrote la&s;t. My Cough is &s;omewhat abated, and I have &s;lept tolerably well the&s;e two Nights.</P>
<P>I fancy, I live as retired, in the mid&s;t of a great City, as you in your Hermitage. I cook for my&s;elf, and drink (rather than eat) by my|&s;elf; for I live entirely on Broth, Chocolate, and Tea. I find, Slops agree with me much
<PB N="194" REF="195">
better than Meat; for I am &s;urely &s;ick, if I touch it.</P>
<P>My Wi&s;hes for you are not confined to Meal-Times, nor do I &s;uppo&s;e your's are: No Moment pa&s;&s;es, but I &s;igh for you: What do I &s;uffer in being &s;eparated from thee! When, when &s;hall we meet, to part no more?</P>
<P>I am &s;o far an Epicurean, as to believe, that Providence de&s;igned a full and perfect U&s;e of all it's Bounties to his Creature, Man.
<Q><L>For Heav'n is paid, when Man receives;</L>
<L>T' enjoy, is to obey.</L></Q>
El&s;e wherefore, with an unwithdrawing Hand, did he create them? It is the Abu&s;e of the&s;e, which con&s;titutes the Crime; and which, in general, bears it's Puni&s;hment in the very Com|mi&s;&s;ion of it.
<Q><L>To the late Revel, and protracted Fea&s;t,</L>
<L>Wild Dreams &s;ucceeded, and di&s;order'd Re&s;t.</L></Q>
They, who indulge the Gratification of any Appetite to Exce&s;s, are far below the Brutes; and to debar our&s;elves of any Enjoyment, within the Bounds of Innocence and Rea&s;on, is
<Q>to live like Nature's Ba&s;tards, not her Sons.</Q>
Every Per&s;on's particular Circum&s;tances ought to fix the Bounds of their Self-Indulgence; for there are many Gratifications, which would be criminal in me, that may be both rea&s;onable and innocent for a Per&s;on, who has a large Fortune.
<PB N="195" REF="196">
Were I Mi&s;tre&s;s of ten thou&s;and Pounds a Year, I would not wi&s;h to multiply my De&s;ires, (which are now confined within a very narrow Com|pa&s;s) becau&s;e, by not having many of my own, I might gratify others; which is to me the highe&s;t Enjoyment, human Nature is capable of. There, indeed, we ri&s;e &s;uperior to the Brute Creation, who, I believe, have much the Ad|vantage in all &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures; for theirs are unmole&s;ted with Intemperance or Remor&s;e. Yet I do not think this is a Cau&s;e for us to &s;purn the rational Enjoyment of tho&s;e Plea&s;ures, we have in common with the Animal World: Let us rather follow their Example in tho&s;e Par|ticulars, where we appear mo&s;t on a Level with them, by following, not oppre&s;&s;ing Nature; which is, in them, another Name for (what we call) Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I have been in&s;en&s;ibly led into a Subject, which, I am con&s;cious, I am by no Means capable of treating ju&s;tly: But you, I am &s;ure, will excu&s;e my Errors on this and every Occa|&s;ion; as they proceed only from the Weakne&s;s of my Head, not Badne&s;s of my Heart; which is filled and guarded by your loved Idea.</P>

<P>I AM particularly concerned at your Cough; for it is the wor&s;t Symptom of a Cold, and what your &s;light Con&s;titution, inclined to an Hectic and Decay, is very little able to bear. My Love to the <HI>India</HI> Folk, becau&s;e you &s;ay they have been very kind and affectionate to you.</P>
<P>I am di&s;plea&s;ed at your &s;aying, you are weary of Life: It is, at lea&s;t, unkind, if not &s;omething
<PB N="199" REF="200">
wor&s;e: It is the Sign of a Lowne&s;s of Spirits, and a Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s; which is much below your Sen&s;e, Virtue, or Religion. I cannot excu&s;e any one for &s;peaking without Thought, who is capable of thinking &s;o well. It was &s;aid by one of the Antients,
<Q>that a patient Re&s;ignation to nece&s;&s;ary Evils was next to the Merit of a voluntary Martyrdom.</Q>
This was a fine Saying in the Days of &s;uper&s;titious Enthu&s;ia&s;m, when Men officiou&s;ly threw them&s;elves in the Way of Per&s;ecution, in order to merit the eighth Beatitude; but, at pre&s;ent, the fir&s;t Virtue, mentioned above, &s;tands unrivalled. Let Men repine at what Misfortune they will, it will be found, upon Examination, that their Lo&s;s of Patience is the greate&s;t Evil they labour under. The ab&s;urd Notion of natural Right to the good Things of this Life, occa&s;ions our Unea&s;ine&s;s at their Lo&s;s; but con&s;ider Matters philo&s;ophically or religiou&s;ly, and all the Concern vani&s;hes. We cannot challenge a Property in any Thing, from Providence, in this Life; for we were not in a Condition to make Terms for our&s;elves, before we came into it; but we &s;hould con&s;ider our&s;elves here, in an happy State of e&s;tabli&s;hing an indefea&s;ible Right to the highe&s;t Enjoyments of the next. Neither Health or Fortune we can call our own, where every Thing fluctuates ince&s;&s;antly; and, if our Furniture be Gla&s;s, why &s;hould we be &s;urprized at it's being broken?
<PB N="200" REF="201">
And it is as vain and ridiculous to grieve at any Lo&s;s of worldly Advantage, as it would be to be mortified, becau&s;e
<Q><L>The very Air, you breathe this Day,</L>
<L>The next may help an A&s;s to bray.</L></Q>
Which is the only Di&s;tich, I remember, of a Poem, I wrote, &s;ome Years ago, upon this very Subject.</P>
<P>Now ob&s;erve, ma Seule, et chere Mignonne, that I am not &s;colding, but only philo&s;ophizing; which being premi&s;ed, I &s;hall go on with an Ob&s;ervation, I have made, long &s;ince, upon one of the Beatitudes; I forget which, in Order; but the Text is,
<Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are the Poor in Spirit,</Q>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here is, methinks, an In&s;tance, among many, of the Difference between the Chri&s;tian and Heathen Philo&s;ophy; which &s;ome Authors, vain of the natural Rea&s;on of Man, have affirmed to be the &s;ame. The latter teaches us Contempt for Riches, and Fortitude in Misfortunes: But the former in&s;pires us with a Re&s;ignation to Poverty, and Patience under Sufferings. One but increa&s;es the &s;avage Fierce|ne&s;s of Man's Nature into a Pride and Stoici&s;m above it: The other &s;oftens us into a Spirit of Humility and Meekne&s;s, not below, but con|&s;onant to, the imperfect State of Man in this Life. While Men, either before, or during their Ignorance of, Revelation, con&s;idered them&s;elves
<PB N="201" REF="202">
only with Regard to this Life, perhaps the Heroi&s;m of Stoic Philo&s;ophy might &s;ufficiently an&s;wer the Purpo&s;es of human Nature, in this confined View: But of what U&s;e are Virtues, Sentiments, or Affections, cultivated here, which can never be exerted in that State, where there will be no Pomps fit to contemn, or Misfortunes to oblige us to &s;uffer? while the Spirit of Meek|ne&s;s and Humility will &s;ufficiently an&s;wer our Ends here, and is the proper Temper to prepare us for the Enjoyment of Love, and Contem|plation, which are the Occupations of <HI>the Ble&s;t above.</HI></P>
<P>As your Cold has probably taken away what little Appetite you had, I &s;hall &s;end you up, by <HI>Thur&s;day</HI>'s Stage, a Crock of the fine&s;t pickled Walnuts, you ever &s;aw or ta&s;ted.

It is but ju&s;t in me to make you &s;ome Return of that Philo&s;ophy, which you have taught me: But in this Science you are infinitely my Superior; for I can but create in you a Di&s;regard for the Things &s;tiled
<PB N="204" REF="205">
of this World, merely by &s;hewing their Trivial|ne&s;s and Vanity in them&s;elves; but you have in&s;pired me with an utter Contempt of them, by putting them in Compari&s;on with your own Worth. However, my Philo&s;ophy is neither of the Cynic or Mi&s;anthrope Kind: I have neither an Aver&s;ion to Men or Things; for I can very well indulge my&s;elf with both; but then I con|&s;ider them like a Dream or a Fea&s;t, which &s;erve as Amu&s;ements for the Time, and leave either no Longing, or a Satiety, behind. Indeed, I take the true U&s;e of Philo&s;ophy to be, not to vex our&s;elves in Pro&s;perity, but to comfort us in Adver&s;ity. In &s;hort, we need not be &s;o rigidly on our Guard again&s;t the Plea&s;ures of this Life; for they &s;eldom happen, or continue long enough to &s;often or ema&s;culate our Natures: But Di&s;|appointments or Misfortunes are the Things, which are mo&s;t familiar to us; and yet, by our Unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;eem the Things, which we are lea&s;t u&s;ed to. Mo&s;t of the Mortifications, we complain of, are what we owe to one another; a great many of which may be avoided, if we ju&s;tly con&s;idered Men but as Tools. An In|&s;trument, which has not Sharpne&s;s enough for a Razor, may have Strength &s;ufficient for a Paring-Shovel; and that, which has not Toughne&s;s for an Hammer, may have proper Weight for a Mallet. Now, to in&s;tance in Men: &mdash; would make a mi&s;erable Confidant; but, if you are to

So that a tolerable Judgment, upon the different Characters of Mankind, may help us to work &s;ome u&s;eful End, even out of the Wor&s;t and Meane&s;t: And, as to the Evils and Goods of Life, a religious Sen&s;e of them will be found to be the only true philo&s;ophic one &mdash; to con&s;ider the fir&s;t as a Reprobation of our Faults, and &s;o amend; and the latter as a Reward of our Virtues, and &s;o per&s;evere.</P>
<P>I took a &s;olitary Walk in my Fields this Evening, contemplating upon &s;uch Subjects as the&s;e; and think, I never ob&s;erved a more beautiful We&s;tern Sky, at the Setting of the Sun. This &s;hall be the Te&s;t with me, whether there be a true poetical Genius in this I&s;land, at pre&s;ent; for &s;uch a one mu&s;t certainly, like <HI>Prometheus,</HI> catch Fire at the Sun in &s;o much Glory: For no Per&s;on can be eminent in this Art, who has not a &s;trong Enthu&s;ia&s;m about the Beauties of Nature; nor without a certain in&s;pired, though not an acquired Knowledge of the Philo&s;ophy of it too. What are all the Hints and Allu&s;ions to Arts and Sciences, &s;ome

of them unknown to the World, and others &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o to him&s;elf, which the Com|mentators mark out in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Works, but a Sort of Prae-&s;entiment, or, as it were, a Flight at Science, which duller Mortals were forced to earn thro' the Labour of Academies? I think, &s;uch In&s;tances as the&s;e, with Dreams, and many other Proofs of &s;tronger Force, may be brought as Arguments for the Independence of the human Soul upon Matter: For, tho' we &s;hould allow the Materiali&s;ts, that the Knowledge, we attain from the Deductions of Rea&s;oning or Reflection, may be but the natural Effect of the animal Spirits upon the Fibres of the Brain, which is the unintelligible Jargon they &s;peak; yet &s;urely the Di&s;coveries, we &s;ometimes make, without any Deduction at all, cannot be accounted for from the mere Organization of Matter, but mu&s;t ari&s;e from a certain Impul&s;e foreign to it.</P>

<P>AS I have had no Letter from you la&s;t Po&s;t, I &s;hall employ that Portion of Time, which is more particularly dedicated to you three Times a Week, in communicating to you &s;uch Reflections as occur to me, at pre&s;ent; which I take ju&s;t in the very Order they &s;ucceed one another in my own Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="211">I am, for&s;ooth, a great Philo&s;opher:&mdash;I prac|ti&s;e it in my&s;elf, and perform it to all the World. In the &s;evere&s;t Trials, I think I &s;hould be able to exhibit my&s;elf to the Satisfaction of all Spec|tators. In a Gaol, I could comfort my&s;elf with the&s;e Reflections:
<Q>Here I can enjoy a perfect Vacation from all Bu&s;ine&s;s or Care: All Soli|citude after Honours, and all Anxiety about Fortune, are u&s;ele&s;s here, becau&s;e incom|patible with my pre&s;ent State. I can here give up my whole Time to Reading and Contemplation, without the Reproach of Idlene&s;s; and can here indulge my much-loved Solitude, without the Imputation of a mi&s;anthrope Singularity. Here my Occupa|tion and my Lei&s;ure are all my own; for few intrude upon the Wretch's Levee. Wel|come the Interruption of tho&s;e that do; for he mu&s;t be a Friend indeed, who &s;eeks us in a Gaol. Happy then, thrice-happy State, which, at the &s;ame Time, proves our Virtue, and approves our Friends!</Q>
Even in the Day of Sickne&s;s, and the Night of Death, could I &s;u&s;tain the Pains, and &s;urvey the Terrors, with an un&s;haken Mind, from this Soliloquy:
<Q>Grant, ju&s;t God, that the Vices, Errors, and Follies, of my pa&s;t intemperate Youth, may be oppo&s;ed, at the great Day of Account, again&s;t the humane Offices I have performed in Act, and the general Benevolence I have
<PB N="211" REF="212">
always had in Will, even to the va&s;t Circle of all created or po&s;&s;ible Beings of the Univer&s;e; and, in this Hope, welcome thou glorious Death, &s;o much dreaded, becau&s;e &s;o little under&s;tood!</Q>
<Q><L>Welcome, thou Cordial to a troubled Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>The &s;ofte&s;t Remedy, that Grief can find;</L>
<L>The gentle Spell, that lulls our Cares to Re&s;t,</L>
<L>And calms the ruffling Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind!</L></Q>
<Q>Thou happy Minute, the fir&s;t of Immortality, how have Men traduced thee, by comparing thee to a long Sleep! but Sleep is a tedious Death, while Death is but an in&s;tant Sleep.</Q></P>
<P>Yet, with all this Appearance of Philo&s;ophy, I am prone to Anger, Pa&s;&s;ion, and Re&s;entment; and, though I am &s;ufficiently aware of this Foible, and &s;et the whole Force of my Rea&s;on again&s;t it, I am not Ma&s;ter enough of my&s;elf to pre&s;erve my Temper &s;ometimes, upon the &s;lighte&s;t Provocation, even of the Folly of a Child. Now what is the Rea&s;on of &s;uch a re|markable Incon&s;i&s;tency in my Character, has been the Subject of this Hour's Contemplation; and I have attributed it to this; that Nature mu&s;t univer&s;ally prevail, and will always be found too &s;trong for Art. In the fir&s;t In&s;tances, I mentioned to you, I owe my Philo&s;ophy to an happy Turn of Con&s;titution and Genius; to a certain Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s about, and &s;overeign Con|tempt
<PB N="212" REF="213">
for, the Things of this Life, when they are out of my Power, though nobody enjoys them more, when they are within my Reach; and an elevated Hope, and &s;trong Conviction of the Enjoyments of the other World; by the frequent Contemplation of which I have happily improved Nature into an Habit of Philo&s;ophy: But, in the latter Ca&s;e, I am almo&s;t afraid Art will never be able to conquer Nature; though, at &s;ome Times, it may govern, or di&s;gui&s;e it; becau&s;e, perhaps, trifling Occa&s;ions do not &s;ufficiently call upon my Philo&s;ophy to exert it&s;elf; and no Army is &s;o &s;oon overcome, as that which too much de&s;pi&s;es it's Enemy.</P>

<P>YOUR Letters fill me, at once, with the extreme&s;t plea&s;ure, and the tendere&s;t Con|cern.

<PB N="213" REF="214">
of tho&s;e Subjects, which are, indeed, the real, but &s;evere Trials of our Religion and Philo|&s;ophy.

I am certain, I &s;hall never be able to think of your Death, either in a chri&s;tian or philo&s;ophic Light. Let me intreat you never to mention it more: Indeed I cannot bear the Thought.&mdash;
<Q>Forlorn of thee, whither &s;hould I betake me? where &s;ub&s;i&s;t?</Q>
Oh! if you love me, <HI>Harry,</HI> the &s;ingle Con&s;ideration of my Di&s;tre&s;s, in being torn from thee, &s;hould make you even anxious to delay your future Happine&s;s. You would not call the Moment of our Separation an happy one, were thy Soul linked to mine, as mine to thee.</P>
<Q><L>Oh! the &s;oft Commerce! oh! the tender Ties,</L>

<P>I doubt not but you will think my Tender|ne&s;s, upon this Occa&s;ion, intirely &s;elfi&s;h: Indeed I grant it is &s;o;&mdash;for I would leave thee, <HI>Harry</HI>; with Tran&s;port leave thee! well knowing that my Death would be conducive to thy Happine&s;s.

<P>I &s;hall conclude my Letter here, as it would be the Art of &s;inking, to mention even our Meeting in this World; which, indeed, I begin to de&s;pair of; but, in a &s;trong Hope of our future Happine&s;s, I &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<P>HOW va&s;tly am I indebted to that Tender|ne&s;s, which even prevents my De&s;ires, and gratifies my fonde&s;t Wi&s;h, before it is &s;carce formed! Indeed, thou deare&s;t, be&s;t of Men, my Heart is fruitful with a thou&s;and Thoughts of Gratitude and Love to thee.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;et up here at the old Inn; though you all &s;ay it is a bad one: This may be a Rea&s;on for new Gue&s;ts not to come, but not for old ones to quit it. I always &s;uppo&s;e, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, that Poverty is the Rea&s;on of bad Accommodations; and make it a Sort of Cha|rity, to &s;upport the Indigent; and, when I eat or lye badly, it helps Dige&s;tion, and &s;oftens my Repo&s;e, to con&s;ider that others eat or &s;leep the better for it. I made a vile Breakfa&s;t at &mdash;, this Morning, from this Turn of Mind; though I had for&s;worn the old Hou&s;e, upon my going up to Town la&s;t. Such Reflections as the&s;e, my dear <HI>Fanny,</HI> are extremely plea&s;ant; and their being uncommon is, perhaps, one of the Rea&s;ons, I amu&s;e my&s;elf with them.</P>
<P>I halted here, in order to write to &mdash;, in&s;tead of paying him a Vi&s;it; for I do Bu&s;ine&s;s better by Proxy, than in Per&s;on. The Rea&s;on that I write better than I &s;peak, is not, as <HI>Dryden</HI> ob&s;erves upon <HI>Per&s;ius,</HI> that I have a Difficulty in finding a Meaning; but rather, as the &s;ame Critic remarks upon <HI>Juvenal,</HI>
<Q>car il e&s;t bon de &s;e fair valoir,</Q>
that it is hard to chu&s;e one. I have too much Fancy, and am
<PB N="227" REF="228">
too nice about my Expre&s;&s;ion, to explain my&s;elf off-hand di&s;tinctly and intelligibly. Be&s;ides, the Per&s;ons and Objects, which &s;trike on my Eyes, throw me into a Confu&s;ion, which hinders my Judgment from having fair Play to exert it&s;elf, My Ideas re&s;emble a Painter's Pallet, where you have great Variety of Colours lying together, without Harmony or Order; 'till a &s;kilful Pen|cil has blended them into proper Lights and Shades, to compo&s;e an agreeable Picture. This Difference between my Writing and Speaking mu&s;t be very obvious to you, with whom I have corre&s;ponded, almo&s;t con&s;tantly, for above five Years pa&s;t: And, upon a Review of my Letters lately, I do not recollect to have repeated the &s;ame Sentiment twice; yet I remember to have &s;aid the &s;ame Words, in Conver&s;ation, to you, an hundred times.</P>
<P>Every Mile I rode, &s;ince I left Town, my Impatience to &s;ee <HI>Belvidere</HI> has increa&s;ed. &mdash; Perhaps, the Affection, I have for it, being &s;u&s;pended, while I was with you, (the greater Pa&s;&s;ion ab&s;orbing the le&s;s) was then &s;et at liberty to operate, when we parted; or, perhaps, the Thoughts of quitting, as is natural in &s;oft Minds, have the more attender'd me toward it. If I thought there was a Naiad or Dryad in the Place, who would lament my Ab&s;ence, I &s;hould &s;acrifice my Intere&s;t to my Super&s;tition; but my Religion teaching me, that, where-ever we go,

our Guardian-Angel accompanies us, I think I but obey it's Call, whenever I change my Situation to my whole&s;ome Advantage.</P>
<P>I would have you, by all means, write to Lady &mdash;. You may al&s;o pre&s;ent my <HI>Duty</HI> to her, as &s;he is to you a <HI>Mother.</HI></P>

<P>I BELIEVE, I need not take much Pains to a&s;&s;ure my dear <HI>Harry,</HI> that nothing, but a very &s;evere Illne&s;s, could have prevented my writing la&s;t Po&s;t. However, I hope his own Thoughts furni&s;hed him with &s;ome other Cau&s;e for my Silence; and that he had not the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of the terrible Situation, his poor <HI>Fanny</HI> was in. I was &s;eized with a Contraction in my Stomach on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Morning, attended with an unu&s;ual Pain; but, as I had Intervals of Ea&s;e, I hoped it would go off. I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, in order to go to &mdash;; but, finding my&s;elf grow wor&s;e every Hour, I was, at la&s;t, obliged to &s;end an Apology. The Pain threw me into perfect Convul&s;ions; and, in &s;pite of all the Medicines which were given me, I continued on the Rack 'till <HI>Friday</HI> Morning, when a violent Emetic gave me Ea&s;e. I am now free from Pain, but &s;o extremely weak, that I cannot walk from my
<PB N="229" REF="230">
Bed to the Dining-Room, without Help. Even in tho&s;e Moments, which I thought my la&s;t, I rejoiced you were not with me; as your Sufferings would have added to mine, and made them more than I could bear. Be&s;ides, I &s;hould not have had any Thing to &s;truggle for, had you been pre&s;ent; but the earne&s;t De&s;ire, I have again to &s;ee thee, gave me Strength to encounter tho&s;e Agonies, that would have torn me from thee, my more than Life! I would not let <HI>Tom</HI> write to acquaint you with my Illne&s;s, le&s;t your Apprehen&s;ion &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t &s;omething even wor&s;e than the Reality.</P>
<P>I now congratulate you on my Recovery, and &s;hall proceed to thank my &s;weet <HI>Harry</HI> for both his Letters.</P>
<P>There is, doubtle&s;s, &s;omething inexpre&s;&s;ibly charming in reflecting on tho&s;e Exerci&s;es of Humanity, which my dear practic Philo&s;opher is &s;o con&s;tantly employed in: But, with regard to the two recent In&s;tances you mention, I cannot help thinking, that it is rather doing a general Injury, than a particular Charity, to &s;upport Per&s;ons in any Profe&s;&s;ion, which their Want of Capacity, Indu&s;try, or a proper Fund, renders them unfit for: The&s;e Per&s;ons, &s;o di&s;|qualified, prevent others, who may be capable, from engaging in that Bu&s;ine&s;s, which they do not execute; while them&s;elves might become u&s;eful Members of Society, in another Situation.
<PB N="230" REF="231">
You may, perhaps, think this Way of arguing too &s;evere: But, were we not to regard the general Good more than that of Individuals, the Tenderne&s;s of our Di&s;po&s;itions might impel us to Acts of the highe&s;t Inju&s;tice, and lead us, perhaps, to the Re&s;cue of a Murderer; if we did not reflect on the &s;alutary Effects, which Examples produce, in the general Community. But, while I talk with &s;uch &s;eeming Strictne&s;s, my Heart and Pen di&s;agree; and an inward Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the many Failings, I am in|cident to, &s;trongly reminds me of the mutual Claim, which every Part of the Creation has to each other's Indulgence; and, perhaps, none has more Need of it, than my poor, faulty, helple&s;s Self.</P>
<P>I can very ea&s;ily account for your being able to write in a more clear and di&s;tinct Manner, than you &s;peak: For, be&s;ides the Confu&s;ion of Ideas, which you have found &s;o ju&s;t and pretty a Re&s;emblance for, you have, probably, more Mode&s;ty than any Man, who has lived &s;o long, and been &s;o conver&s;ant with the World, as you have; and I am &s;ure there are Men, who are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the thou&s;andth Part of your Under&s;tanding or Knowledge, who could make a better Figure in a general Conver&s;ation.</P>

<P>AND &s;o, Sir, your chief Concern was for Bab! Indeed, Bab's Mam is affronted; tho' I may venture to a&s;&s;ure you, &s;he was more anxious for it, than her&s;elf. I have as little Fondne&s;s for Life, as mo&s;t People; nor is there

There is the &s;ame Kind of Difference in our Attachment to the dear little one, as in our Affection for each other. You were the fir&s;t and only Object of my Love: For you I felt all the romantic Tenderne&s;s of a fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion; while you, who had loved much and many, were utterly in|&s;en&s;ible to all the &s;oft Inquietudes, the indearing Angui&s;h, the heart-rending Fears, which Pro|vidence, in Mercy to Mankind, decreed &s;hould never be re-felt.</P>

With Regard to the late Matter in Que&s;tion, you may be thoroughly a&s;&s;ured, that both our Ways of thinking and acting will ever be the &s;ame; for I hope, and believe, I have as much Humanity in my Di&s;po&s;ition, as any Per&s;on I ever knew, except your&s;elf.

<P>I AM not, my deare&s;t <HI>Harry,</HI> a &s;ufficient Mi&s;tre&s;s of Language to expre&s;s the heart-felt Plea&s;ure, which your Letters give me: They fill my Mind with &s;uch a Kind of Rapture, as ari&s;es from reflecting on any extraordinary Benefit, we have received from Providence: It is a Mixture of Prai&s;e, Gratitude, and Love. Indeed, every Act of Kindne&s;s of your's rai&s;es me to the be&s;t and true&s;t Devotion. I admire and ble&s;s the Greatne&s;s and Goodne&s;s of that Almighty Being, who formed thee; while my Heart overflows with the mo&s;t thankful Sen&s;e of his unmerited Benevolence, in being graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to make thee mine.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, you have enjoyed but one Day at home, &s;ince we parted; and I have been but one Day abroad: So we remain equal Debtors to Plea&s;ure, if that Term may be ju&s;tly applied to any Circum&s;tance, Time, or Place, I meet with, in your Ab&s;ence.</P>

<P>I will not, becau&s;e I cannot, tell you how &s;incerely I rejoice at hearing you have got the better of your Cholic. I have not had any Return, that &s;ignifies, of my Di&s;order; but am &s;till very lame, and &s;uffer much from the Rheumati&s;m.</P>
<P>I think your Letter to &mdash; an exce&s;&s;ive clever one: It &s;hews, at once, the Man of Sen&s;e and Bu&s;ine&s;s; but &s;till you &s;ay nothing of your own Affairs, and &s;eem more inclined to advi&s;e, than engage with him.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your Letter; and, &s;ince you are well once more, ob&s;erve, that I will never give you <HI>Credit</HI> for being &s;ick again; and I hope you will never have Di&s;credit for being irregular, to which, believe me, all your Complaints are owing. At the &s;ame Time, I di&s;claim any Com|pa&s;&s;ion from, you too, when I am ill again of my old Di&s;order; for, from the Di&s;continuance of it, &s;ince I left Town, I am convinced, that early Hours, and &s;upperle&s;s Slumbers, are the ab&s;olute Cure for it. As truly as that Vice produces Vice, Exce&s;&s;es, being of the &s;ame Nature, beget each other. We ought certainly to &s;it up after Supper; then we &s;hall, as &s;urely, lie a-bed in the Morning; and, con&s;equently, a late Breakfa&s;t falls too &s;uddenly upon Dinner; then a &s;light Repa&s;t keeps back the natural. Appetite 'till Night, when the Irregularity mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, begin again. And yet the Cure is ea&s;y; for, but any one Exce&s;s in this Rotation being omitted, the whole will fall again into it's due Order; as, by &s;topping any &s;ingle Point of a Circle, you arre&s;t the whole.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I had gone &s;o far, a poor Boy begged at my Door, in the Stile of a poor Scholar, and
<PB N="241" REF="242">
mode&s;tly a&s;ked for nothing but Paper. It &s;eems, he is orphan'd both of Father and Mother, and lives from Cottage to Cottage in the Pari&s;h where he was born. The Boy had a good hone&s;t Look, and I took him into <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI>'s Shop, and bound him Apprentice. I am plea&s;ed with the Thought of what charming Surprize it will be To-morrow to the whole Pari&s;h, when they inquire after their Foundling, to hear, that Providence met him begging in the Way, had Charity for him, and bound him to a Trade.</P>
<P>I am very glad to hear, that <HI>our</HI> Lady is coming to Town; but would not have you decline writing to her, on that Pretence. You can &s;ay many prettier and genteeler Things in a Letter, than you could in Per&s;on; and Writing, &s;uch as your's, to &s;uch Ta&s;te and Under&s;tanding as her's, has confirmed more la&s;ting Friend&s;hips, than ever Conver&s;ation did.</P>
<P>I have not hinted any Thing to this Hou&s;e about my Corre&s;pondence with &mdash;; nor &s;hall I, 'till I &s;ee the Event of it. If it &s;hould not an&s;wer your Expectations, I will not &s;peak of it at all. I would not, for fifty Guineas, I had not proceeded as far as I did; but my failing of Succe&s;s will not give me one Shilling's Worth of Concern. I &s;hould be unea&s;y at having pa&s;&s;ed over, through Neglect or Inadvertency, any Opportunity, Providence had thrown in my Way; but more particularly in this Ca&s;e, as

<P>I RETURNED this Day extremely fatigued from the A&s;&s;izes; and, having roved through my Gardens and Fields, and looked over my Manufactures, while it was Light, I have but little more Time, than to write one Letter more to &mdash;, and to make a Copy of it for you.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE three of your Letters lying before me now, which I had not Time to an&s;wer or remark upon before; as you know the Hurry, and Complication of Bu&s;ine&s;s, I am engaged in.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="246">As to &mdash;, whom you inquire about, I have not heard one Syllable, &s;ince his fir&s;t, and only Letter to me. Tho' he &s;aid then, he was to &s;tay at &mdash; for a Fortnight; which Time was not elap&s;ed, before he had my la&s;t Letter; yet, perhaps, he did not &s;tay as long as he de&s;igned, and might have gone home, before I had fini&s;hed my E&s;&s;ay. This may account for the Delay of hearing from him: Or, perhaps, he has taken Time to con&s;ider, and con&s;ult &s;ome Friends about it. But, as I &s;aid in a former Letter on this Head, I was &s;o prepared, as not to &s;uffer any Di&s;appointment, from the very fir&s;t of my Application to him; &s;o &s;hall trouble my&s;elf no more about the Matter, unle&s;s I hear from him again; and then it &s;hall be as a new Affair to me.</P>
<P>You have renewed a Subject, which we have had frequent Di&s;putes about; that my Sen&s;e is better than your's, but your Love greater than mine. Now I &s;hall &s;till argue both the&s;e Points with you; and the latter, I hope, I &s;hall make, at lea&s;t, doubtful, during our Lives. If I have a &s;tronger Sen&s;e, you have a prettier one; and, if I appear to have any Advantage over you, in the Humility of your Opinion only, it is more owing to the Fortitude of my Mind, than the Excellence of my Under&s;tanding. As to the &s;econd Point, it is out of Debate, as you &s;eem to have given it up, by the fir&s;t; for
<PB N="246" REF="247">
a Man mu&s;t love you in Proportion to his Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I did not mean to &s;cold, but warn my Pet, when I hinted at Irregularities; which, I appre|hended, was the Occa&s;ion of the heavy Cold, you complained of. What I meant was &s;itting up, and lying in Bed, late; both of which are very bad, in a <HI>double</HI> Sen&s;e, at pre&s;ent. But I am quite ea&s;y, &s;ince you have promi&s;ed to conform to the Rules, I &s;hall pre&s;cribe to you: As you likewi&s;e know my Sentiments already, I need not repeat them; for I have that Con|fidence in you, that you will &s;trictly govern your&s;elf by them. Nor need I endeavour to give them Weight, by hinting to you, that not only your own Health and Spirits, but the Health, Strength, and Happine&s;s of that, which may, one Day, be as dear to you as your own, entirely depend upon the prudent Regimen of your&s;elf, at this Time. I am up every Morning at Five, tho' I do not go to Bed 'till Twelve; and, notwith&s;tanding the Labour of Body, and Anxiety of Mind, I go through, all the Day, I feel &s;uch Chearfulne&s;s and Flow of Spirits about me, owing to this alone, that I cannot contain my&s;elf from &s;inging and dancing about my Fields, like one &s;tung by the Tarantula.</P>
<P>I am now gone through your three Letters, and am &s;orry they are at an End; for, like a

<P>WHEN I challenged you upon your talk|ing of Death, I did not mean, that you &s;poke of it in &s;uch a &s;plenetic Way, as betrayed a Fear of dying: I was rather apprehen&s;ive, that you mentioned it in a Manner, which &s;hewed no Sort of Concern about the Matter; and pardon me, my be&s;t and late&s;t Hope, if this &s;hould naturally alarm both my Fears and Jealou&s;y.

<P>BELIEVE me, my ever-dear, my much-loved <HI>Harry,</HI> when I tell you that my talking of Death need not alarm your Jealou&s;y; for I &s;olemnly declare, I find nothing dreadful in the Thoughts of his Approach, but the too tender Concern, I feel at parting with you. If this be a Crime, I confe&s;s my Guilt: But let it be a Con&s;olation to you, as well as me, that I am not con&s;cious of any other unrepented Sin; but find my Soul filled with a &s;tedfa&s;t Hope, that, thro' the Merits of my Redeemer, I &s;hall be happy. Now let the Re&s;ignation, with which I bear the pre&s;ent Pains inflicted on me, and the Calmne&s;s, with which I expect tho&s;e that are to come, bear witne&s;s to my Love for thee; &s;ince that alone enables me to &s;upport the pre&s;ent, and expect the future, without even wi&s;hing for that
<PB N="249" REF="250">
certain Relief, which Death affords to human Mi&s;ery. Nay, I will go farther yet, and &s;ay, I wi&s;h to live, from the dear Hope that my Life is, and may be of Moment to thy Happine&s;s. But in this, and every Thing, let us endeavour at a perfect Re&s;ignation to the Di&s;pen&s;ations of the Almighty; and &s;ay, with Truth and Chear|fulne&s;s, his Will, not our's, be done!</P>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured, my charming tout en &s;emble, you cannot be hurt, by what you call,
<Q>my taking you to Pieces.</Q>
You are perfect enough to &s;tand a much nicer Scrutiny, than I am capable of making. But indeed you mi&s;apprehend me, when you &s;u&s;pect me of intending any &s;uch Matter. It is more than I can do, to defend my&s;elf; nor had I ever the lea&s;t De&s;ign of finding Fault with you.</P>
<P>You &s;ometimes accu&s;e me of Weakne&s;s, which I am actually guilty of, but cannot help. I am mortified at your &s;eeming to expect I &s;hould be perfect, when I &s;et up for nothing more, than a mere, &s;imple, mortal Woman: Of cour&s;e, I endeavour to lay the Fault on Nature, rather than Will: And indeed I am convinced, that Con&s;titution has a greater Share in our Virtues and Vices, than we are willing to allow; and that a &s;trong Frame of Body is a great Help to the Mind. We have had frequent In&s;tances of Per&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t Fortitude, becoming mi&s;erably pu&s;illanimous, when the
<PB N="250" REF="251">
animal Spirits were oppre&s;&s;ed by Pain, Age, or Sickne&s;s. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> in the latter Part of his Life, u&s;ed to cry, like a &s;ick Girl, if he lo&s;t a Game at Picquet, and &s;ay, every one could beat him then:
<Q><L>Did this become</L>
<L>Whom Armies follow'd, and a People lov'd?</L></Q>
Yet &s;ure it would have been the utmo&s;t Cruelty to have reproached him for this Weakne&s;s; or from thence to have thrown any Reflection on that noble &s;pirit, he formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. In &s;hort, my dear <HI>Harry,</HI> it is my Opinion, that Pro|vidence, to moderate the Pride of Man, has made the Faculties of the Mind depend more on the Formation of the Body, than we are aware of; at lea&s;t, I am willing to think &s;o, as it naturally accounts for my Want of Re&s;olution and Strength of Mind, be&s;ides an hundred and fifty other Failings, I am incident to.</P>
<P>Adieu, my fir&s;t, my be&s;t, my only Wi&s;h and Hope! May you ever retain that Philo&s;ophy, which I admire, not reproach you for; and may I never furni&s;h you with Trials, which may prove it's Virtue, or exhau&s;t it's Strength!</P>

<P>I THINK your noble Corre&s;pondent makes a very paltry Figure in his la&s;t Letter. I own, I had a better Opinion of his Sen&s;e and Spirit, than to &s;uppo&s;e he could be alarmed at finding a Per&s;on, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the&s;e Merits in an higher Degree, than him&s;elf; but I am now convinced, that the Superiority, you demon&s;trated, is the Rea&s;on of his declining any farther Connection with you. It is not ea&s;y to fall, with a good Grace, from a Principal to a Second, in any Point, which we have much at Heart; nor can we bear the Per&s;on, who&s;e &s;uperior Excellence makes us appear in an inferior Light, even to our&s;elves. <HI>Swift</HI> is the only Author, or Per&s;on, I ever met with, who hone&s;tly confe&s;&s;es this Foible:

<L><HI>Arbuthnot</HI> is no more my Friend,</L>

How|ever, if I live, I will fall into whatever Cour&s;e of reading you think proper, as I &s;hall always be plea&s;ed with adopting your Sentiments, or modelling mine by them, as far as my poor, little Capacity will admit. But let me beg you not to attempt curing me of the Pain, which your Ab&s;ence will ever give me; for, as nothing but Indifference can render me ea&s;y in that Particular, be a&s;&s;ured it is out of your Power to make me &s;o.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding your Situation, which I know requires your Pre&s;ence, I very &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;in|cerely wi&s;h you here, at this and every Moment.

<P>YOUR Ob&s;ervation upon &mdash; is extremely ju&s;t, and expre&s;&s;ed in a very pretty Turn and Manner; and, tho' I did not flatter my&s;elf in the Way you have taken it, yet that may rather be his Rea&s;on, than none at all; for, as to the Objection he makes, with regard to the Expence, I think my Letters &s;ufficiently proved that the Expence of my Scheme would be con&s;iderably le&s;s than his own Plan.</P>
<P>Your Remark upon &mdash; puts me in mind of a Pa&s;&s;age of Sir <HI>Francis Bacon</HI>'s Treati&s;e upon the Wi&s;dom of the Antients; where he labours to give a new Moral to the old Fables of Antiquity. <HI>Juno</HI> is &s;aid to be woo'd by <HI>Jupiter,</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="255">
in the Form of a Cuckow; upon which he makes the following Comment:
<Q>That Men often impede their own Succe&s;s by O&s;tentation of &s;uperior Merit; and that e&s;pecially with Per&s;ons, who have more Arrogance and Pride, intimated by the Character of <HI>Juno,</HI> than Sen&s;e or Merit. The &s;ure&s;t Way to win their Favour is, to appear as mean and humble, both in Virtue and outward Appearance, as po&s;&s;ible.</Q></P>
<P>The whole Treati&s;e, which I am now quoting from, is, in my Opinion, a very poor Performance, and much below &s;o great a Man. The Morals drawn from the Tales of the Pan|theon are wretchedly forced, and many of them improperly adapted. His Stile is ordinary, and Expre&s;&s;ions paltry.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Life, you cannot &s;urely think, that I would not rather be with you, even in Town, than from you, even here: Why then do you &s;eem to upbraid me? Oh! never, never do &s;o again. Be a&s;&s;ured this once for all, and then never let a Doubt or Surmi&s;e di&s;turb your Brea&s;t, that I never &s;tay a Day from you, but when it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould, both for your pre&s;ent Security and future Happine&s;s. You can &s;urely calculate pretty near the Time, you would mo&s;t particularly de&s;ire my Attendance; and it will certainly be Time enough for me to go up then. If I &s;hould go at pre&s;ent, perhaps I &s;hould

<P>AS to the Conver&s;ation with &mdash;, I &s;hould be much obliged, if you would let me know who was the &s;econd Per&s;on; which, upon my Honour, I &s;hall never mention either to him or the other; and this you may be a&s;&s;ured of,

both upon your Account and mine. It may be of U&s;e to me to know his Confident upon this Occa&s;ion, but only &s;o, if I keep my Mind to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Such Expre&s;&s;ions, as he made U&s;e of, though the &s;ame that you quoted, may very well bear a different Sen&s;e from what Mi&s;take, Prejudice again&s;t him, or in favour of me, might po&s;&s;ibly apprehend them in; or, even &s;uppo&s;ing them capable of no other Meaning, but the unkind one reported to you, yet the Ill-nature of the Tongue does not always proceed from the Ma|lice of the Heart; and the unmeaning Purpo&s;es of a light Reverie, or the vague Folly of an idle Dream, may &s;ometimes be mi&s;taken for a deliberate and determined Scheme of Action. I have not, thank Providence, in my own Heart, Malice to any Man: I have therefore no Jealou&s;y of any Man's evil De&s;igns towards me. The few, I love, I love entirely, both with Friend|&s;hip and E&s;teem: Tho&s;e, whom I merely love not, (for I hate no one) have my general Bene|volence and Charity. This happy Ca&s;t of Mind has enabled me to live hitherto very ea&s;ily and comfortably, both in the World, and my own Clo&s;et; and has turned the Edge of many Mortifications and Di&s;appointments, I have met with, in my Communication with Mankind; which, though frequent, I may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be not well qualified to bear with; as, from the
<PB N="257" REF="258">
general favourable Opinion I have of human Nature, in Honour to it's Creator, the Con|viction of Ye&s;terday prepares me not for the Di&s;appointment of To-morrow. My Affections vary, but my Friend&s;hips never; for the fir&s;t depend upon others, but the latter upon my&s;elf; or, rather, this re&s;ts upon an higher Principle than the &s;light Ba&s;is of human Connections. This Principle is not my own; it was graciou&s;ly lent me by Providence, who would have un|kindly given me Life without it. I will &s;pend it here with pious U&s;e, and pay it back with grateful Tribute! And the Lord incline our Hearts to keep this Law!</P>

<P>AS I was &s;itting down to write about three Hours ago, I was taken &s;o ill, I feared I &s;hould not be able to hold the Pen this Day. I have got a little Ea&s;e, and &s;hall employ the happy Interval in acknowledging your Letters. I have already declared my Incapacity of accept|ing the Plea&s;ure, you de&s;igned me.

<P>As to your coming to me, take my Word, I was never more in earne&s;t, than when I de&s;ired you to con&s;ult your own Intere&s;t, rather than

<P>AS you have conde&s;cended to be my Pupil, I &s;hall recommend the Cour&s;e of Reading I &s;hould chu&s;e for you; and, to lead the Way, have here &s;ent you one of my former Letters
<PB N="261" REF="262">
to you, upon this Subject. I beg you will &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, how &s;trongly I have there recommended tho&s;e Tracts referred to, with other Writings of this Kind; and that you will carefully and lei&s;urely read them regularly thro', with that &s;ober Sen&s;e and rational Reflection, which is nece&s;&s;ary to give you the full Benefit of &s;uch a Study. For, as <HI>Young</HI> &s;ays,
<Q><L>Unle&s;s for &s;ome peculiar End de&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>Learning's the &s;pecious Trifling of the Mind.</L></Q>
To &s;ettle the Cour&s;e of Study is but half the Work; the Method of reading is what com|pletes the Scheme. He, who reads mo&s;t, &s;tudies lea&s;t: For it is with the Mind, as with the Stomach; where not the Food it &s;wallows, but the Dige&s;tion it performs, turns that to Nou|ri&s;hment, which would otherwi&s;e be a Poi&s;on. Therefore I would recommend it to you never to take a Book in one Hand, without a Pen in the other: And I expect your &s;e&s;inble Remarks and philo&s;ophical Reflections, of which indeed you are very capable, upon every one of the Papers, I have quoted for you, in the inclo&s;ed Letter; and, by the Time you have gone regularly thro' them, I hope to point out &s;ome|thing farther for you, in our mutually de&s;ired Conver&s;ation together.</P>
<P>You talk in a &s;plenetic Way, in your Letter, of dying, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now I will not &s;cold you again,

for the hundredth Time; becau&s;e I am very &s;ure, if you could avoid it, you would, when you know how often it has di&s;obliged and di&s;|plea&s;ed me. I am indeed &s;incerely concerned at your ill State of Health, at pre&s;ent; and as much &s;o, that you will not exert that Strength of Mind, which you may find your&s;elf Mi&s;tre&s;s of, if you will but take a little Pains to try. Indeed, my dear <HI>Fanny,</HI> you are capable of being a cleverer Creature, than you &s;ometimes appear to be; and I own it vexes me, when I &s;ee you, at any Time, fall below your own Sen&s;e and Virtue, which I am always rouzing you to, as there needs nothing more to make you perfect.</P>

<P>INCLOSE you this Paper, becau&s;e it relates to the Subject of one of my late Letters, about Reading. I &s;end it to you more for your Amu&s;ement, than In&s;truction; as you need no Hint of this Kind: Nor, indeed, do I think

<P>THOUGH you caution me about &s;peaking my Opinion freely about <HI>Elfrida,</HI> I mu&s;t not be confined or re&s;trained by any Thing, but my own Judgment, as far as that will go.</P>
<P>The Author's prefatory Letters &s;hew him to be a better Critic, than his Work &s;hews him
<PB N="269" REF="270">
to be a Poet. There are &s;ome pretty Turns, which any one, who <HI>imitates,</HI> may write: But the Soul of Poetry is wanting; which I am certain of, from my not <HI>feeling,</HI> through the whole; and a Work mu&s;t be very &s;light and in&s;ipid, which amu&s;es only the Fancy, without affecting the Heart. I will not allow any Thing to make us <HI>wi&s;er,</HI> which does not make us better; and the cold inanimate Contemplation of moral Beauty is not &s;ufficient for this. He, who &s;aid, Virtue need but be &s;een, to be adored, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf but faintly; I &s;ay, &s;he mu&s;t be felt.</P>
<P>But to return &mdash; <HI>Orgar</HI> is a vile, unnatural Brute, who would pro&s;titute his Daughter to the Honour of being a King's Mi&s;tre&s;s. <HI>Athelwold</HI> is but a poor Character thro' the whole; and, as to <HI>Elfrida,</HI> I will not compliment her &s;o much, to &s;ay there is any Parity between your Sentiments and her's.

<P>Adieu, my dear Pet! May you never have <HI>Elfrida</HI>'s Fate! though I would rather you had that than <HI>Semele</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I met Ye&s;terday with <HI>Bolingbroke</HI>'s Letters upon the Method and U&s;e of reading Hi&s;tory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have gone through but the two fir&s;t Letters.

<P>I think &s;uch a Man may as well be a&s;leep; for he can only be &s;aid to have plea&s;ant Dreams, who reads any Thing, but with a View of im|proving his Morals, or regulating his Conduct.

<P>You &s;ay, that the pre&s;ent Unea&s;ine&s;s of your Mind calls for Amu&s;ement. I &s;hould think, that Amu&s;ements were fitter for a Mind at Ea&s;e.

In &s;hort, I have ob&s;erved, that there is a great deal of Sen&s;e and Virtue, with &s;ome Smattering of Philo&s;ophy, in the World; but that great, noble, and comprehen&s;ive Quality, called For|titude, &s;eems to have quite for&s;aken Mankind; and <HI>Scarron</HI> might well &s;ay, if, in Truth, he could even &s;ay &s;o much,
<Q><L>None, but my&s;elf, could e'er that Pitch attain,</L>
<L>To &s;port with Mi&s;ery, and je&s;t in Pain.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="274">May Heaven, mo&s;t earne&s;tly &s;olicited by my Prayers, defend my deare&s;t, amiable Love from both! and from every Evil, natural and moral, except the Penalties, which &s;he de&s;erves her&s;elf! and then &s;urely her Happine&s;s here will be an Earne&s;t of that Bli&s;s, which perfect Spirits enjoy hereafter. Amen to that &s;weet Prayer!</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Francis Bacon</HI> has a fine Pa&s;&s;age, which may be quoted here, as a noble Definition of that Con&s;tancy, and Fortitude of Mind, which I am lamenting;
<Q>prepared for every Event, armed in all Fortunes, fore&s;eeing without Fear, enjoying without Satiety, and &s;uffering without Impatience.</Q>
This great Character is in the Power of &s;o &s;mall a Portion of Sen&s;e and Virtue to attain to, that, for my Part, I am re&s;olved to commence Hero from the Date of this Letter. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXCIII.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD the provoking Plea&s;ure of receiving two Letters from my dear <HI>Harry,</HI> by Ye&s;terday's Po&s;t. Tho' they were of different Dates, the Po&s;t-Mark was the &s;ame on both; &s;o that the&s;e teizing Delays mu&s;t be owing to the Per&s;on, you &s;end with your Letters.</P>
<P>We do indeed too often mi&s;apprehend each other. I make no Doubt but the Fault lies chiefly on my Side; for I am con&s;cious I have too much Quickne&s;s in my Di&s;po&s;ition; which,
<PB N="275" REF="276">
joined to the earne&s;t De&s;ire I have to render my|&s;elf agreeable to you, puts me on endeavouring to ju&s;tify or explain away my Faults, perhaps, with too much Warmth. It is long &s;ince I have agreed with my dear Preceptor, in owning that Trifles will not, even for the pre&s;ent Moment, amu&s;e a rational Mind. There is a Kind of Self-contempt in&s;eparable from the mi&s;-&s;pending our Time, in Pur&s;uit of any Thing, which does not tend to make us wi&s;er or better, and, of cour&s;e, happier. But this Feeling is, I believe, only known to intelligent Minds; tho' I have heard People complain of throwing away their Time on a Book, that did not plea&s;e them, who were utterly incapable of making any Reflection, or forming any Sentiment from <HI>Milton, Shake|&s;peare,</HI> or <HI>Addi&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>It is, indeed, as my &s;weet Love ob&s;erves, not in the Power of Trifles to relieve or calm the Sorrows of the Mind, or divert the Thoughts from bodily Pain. It is only in the Power of Religion, Philo&s;ophy, and Sen&s;e, to aid us in &s;urmounting pre&s;ent Ills, by teaching us to look forward to an happy Futurity.</P>
<P>As I had entered into a regular Cour&s;e of reading the <HI>Spectators,</HI> I have not yet gone thro' the particular Set of Papers, you recommended. I think it is impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould doubt my being really charmed with tho&s;e, I have met: But, alas! what Comment could you expect
<PB N="276" REF="277">
from me, on Subjects, where the little Under|&s;tanding, I am Mi&s;tre&s;s of, may be compared to an Infant ju&s;t weaned from Leading-Strings, afraid to make a Step without a Guide?</P>
<P>I never did &s;et up for the lea&s;t Degree of Fortitude: My Sen&s;ations are much too lively for a Stoic: A decent Re&s;ignation to the Will of the Supreme Being is the utmo&s;t I a&s;pire to. Nor do I look upon it, that my complaining to you can be deemed a Breach of Duty, in this Point: You are &s;o much my&s;elf, and every Faculty of my Soul is &s;o much devoted to you, that I can &s;carce call them mine. You have my Thoughts all wild and uncorrected: Tho' you may not approve them, you &s;hould pardon, while you endeavour to reform them, as you do tho&s;e faulty ones, that ri&s;e involuntarily in your own Heart.
<Q>For where's the Palace, where|into foul Things intrude not?</Q></P>
<P>My Heart's dear <HI>Harry</HI> mu&s;t give me Leave to a&s;&s;ure him, I am &s;incerely grateful for that elegant and affecting Solicitude, he expre&s;&s;es for my Happine&s;s; of which he is, and I hope ever will be, the fir&s;t and only Agent, in the Hand of Heaven. May it reward and ble&s;s him for the Kindne&s;s, and return tho&s;e Wi&s;hes, which he makes for me, to him an hundred-fold!</P>
<P>You do me but &s;trict Ju&s;tice, when you believe that nothing, but <HI>extreme Illne&s;s,</HI> or &s;ome very extraordinary Accident, could prevent
<PB N="277" REF="278">
my writing. Your not hearing from me, by <HI>Saturday</HI>'s Po&s;t, was owing to the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI> I was the whole Day in racking Pain, and could not re&s;t three Minutes in any Place; therefore, as I had no Letter from you to an&s;wer, I thought it cruel to make you unea&s;y with my Pains.</P>
<P>Tho' I am tran&s;ported at the Thoughts of &s;eeing my deare&s;t <HI>Harry,</HI> I would, by no means, de&s;ire you to come, unle&s;s you can do it with Convenience to your&s;elf; for I would have you leave all your Cares behind, when your dear Pre&s;ence is to bani&s;h mine. But in this, and every Thing, I &s;ubmit my&s;elf to your Di&s;cretion and your Love.</P>
<P>Adieu, my deare&s;t Life! May it be as con|&s;i&s;tent with your Bu&s;ine&s;s, as I am &s;ure it is with your Inclinations, &s;oon to &s;ee your fond and faithful</P>

<P>I WRITE this from my new Farm, which I might &s;tile the Paraclete; for there are "white Walls and &s;ilver Springs" enough to intitle it to that Appellation; though there are better Rea&s;ons for it. So romantic a Place never
<PB N="278" REF="279">
was, if Wildne&s;s, Solitarine&s;s, with the Print of <HI>A&s;traea</HI>'s la&s;t Foot&s;teps in the Situation, and Love and Con&s;tancy in the Proprietor, be the di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks of that Character.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething amu&s;es and plea&s;es me extremely in this Chain of Thought; that Pro|vidence &s;eems to have marked out this Spot of Earth for your's, by a Train of unfore&s;een Accidents. I had taken the Land at a Time, when you and I were upon &s;uch Terms, that it it was highly probable we &s;hould never be again reconciled. You had good Rea&s;ons to be highly picqued at my Behaviour; and your Prudence, your Pride, and Honour, was a ju&s;t Bar to a Re-union. At that Time, perhaps, all Libertine as I was, with many Schemes in Imagination, and many Views in Pro&s;pect, I might have had &s;ome Con&s;olation in the Lo&s;s of a Woman, whom my Pa&s;&s;ion loved, and my Rea&s;on e&s;teemed, in the Thought of being, in &s;ome Sort, ea&s;ed from that Re&s;traint, which my Regard to your Worth, with my natural Sentiments of Genero&s;ity and Honour, never yet (thank God!) extingui&s;hed in me, mu&s;t have laid me under&mdash;at &s;uch a Time, I &s;ay, we met by Chance: When &s;peaking of this extra|ordinary, bold, and enterprizing Purcha&s;e of mine, engaging for &s;ix hundred Acres of Land at a de&s;perate Rent, at a hazardous Cri&s;is, and in a dangerous Country, which required a large
<PB N="279" REF="280">
Fund to improve, when I was above two thou|&s;and Pounds in Debt, and had neither Money, Credit, nor Stock to apply; upon de&s;cribing the Situation of the Place, you de&s;ired I would name it &mdash;; adding, that it was probably the only Compliment, you might ever de&s;ire from me. Some time after this, you and I projected a Plan of Paraclete; which I have, this Day, by an accidental Turn of Thought, adapted to this Place. You may remember, la&s;t Winter, that, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> <GAP DESC="blank"> and, when I was to look out for a Nur&s;e, and Accommodation for your &s;weet ante-loved Babe, I was, from &s;ome prior Rea&s;ons, directed to this particular Place, for both.</P>
<P>Let me indulge my&s;elf farther in the Con|templation of this Scheme of Providence, with regard to you and me. You cho&s;e and approved of me, when you had before you, as <HI>Milton</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>The World to chu&s;e, and Providence your Guide.</Q>
Sen&s;e, Wit, and Reading were, from my earlie&s;t Years, the Objects of my implicit Adoration; and, whenever I changed my Pa&s;&s;ion, it was in Search of a fit Subject for my Admiration. I, at length, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, unknowing, the&s;e rare Qualities in you, and was in Danger,
<Q>like the ba&s;e <HI>Indian,</HI> to throw a Pearl away, richer
<PB N="280" REF="281">
than all my Tribe:</Q>
But, as my Rea&s;on improved by your charming Conver&s;e more than my own Reflection, I found, acknowledged, and inca&s;ed the Gem, thou
<Q>one entire and perfect Chry&s;olite!</Q>
and hope never to exchange thee, but for a better World than this, made more eminently &s;o, by a nobler and higher Con|ver&s;e there with thee, thou amiable Cherubim and Seraphim in one! in whom are &s;o perfectly joined their two di&s;tingui&s;hing Characteri&s;tics, Love and Knowledge! the plea&s;ing Hope of which Enjoyment above will be a &s;tronger In|citement to my Virtue here below. In &s;hort, I do not know two Per&s;ons alive, who &s;eem more adapted by Nature for each other. Excu&s;e this Vanity in me, when your Approbation has already made my Panegyric. My Calmne&s;s and Philo&s;ophy is fit to temper the Misfortunes and Di&s;appointments of Life; and your Wit and Spirit proper to &s;ea&s;on and enliven the Ea&s;e or Plea&s;ures of it;

<P>I DRANK hard at &mdash;, and it is now too late to reach home: However, I might get as far as &mdash;, with Ea&s;e; but have &s;topped &s;hort here, that I might be at Liberty to think of, and write to you, more agreeable to me than any Company or Conver&s;e, I can meet with in this World, while my Back is turned to you.</P>
<P>I received a very pretty Letter from you la&s;t Po&s;t, a very generous and a kind one too. The fatal Nece&s;&s;ity of my too long Ab&s;ence from you is &s;ufficiently irk&s;ome in it&s;elf; and the &s;en&s;ible Light in which you apprehend it, and the ra|tional Manner you &s;peak of it in, &s;aves me that additional Weight of Anxiety, which would be intolerable. You can always command Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on enough, when you are Mi&s;tre&s;s of your&s;elf; and, in Obedience to them, let me be proud to own my&s;elf your Va&s;&s;al too.</P>
<P>The Comments, I expect from you, upon tho&s;e Writings, and others of the &s;ame Cla&s;s, which I have recommended to you, are be&s;t &s;hewn in your Life, by Chearfulne&s;s and Con|tent; the fir&s;t manife&s;ted in Philo&s;ophy, and the latter in Re&s;ignation. Whenever I &s;it down to

read any Writings of this Kind, I fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf, in order to try their Power, labour|ing under all the Ills of Sickne&s;s, Sorrow, Poverty, and Oppre&s;&s;ion: When, in a &s;hort Time, all the&s;e gloomy Cares are di&s;pelled, like Mi&s;ts before the enlivening Sun-beams; and I look back fir&s;t, with Triumph, and Contempt upon tho&s;e fleeting Shadows, which are now po&s;ting &s;o far behind me; and then look forward, with Gratitude and Joy, to that glorious Pro&s;pect wide-opening before me. In &s;hort, there is but one Misfortune in Life, which I think could prove too hard for &s;uch Reflections as the&s;e to &s;upport me through; I mean the Lo&s;s of thee, of thee, my only Gain: And I am very certain, that nothing could prevent me from following you precipitately, but the Fear, by that ra&s;h Action, of lo&s;ing you for ever.</P>
<P>Among the Papers, which I de&s;ign to collect in my <HI>Solamen mi&s;eris,</HI> I would in&s;ert the Hymn to Contentment, and Night-piece on Death, of <HI>Parnell</HI>'s. I happened to read them both this Morning, at <HI>Kitty</HI>'s; and, if it would not appear too much Vanity, I would add &s;ome of my Letters to you, where I &s;peak of the Providence and Mercy of God, and the Immortality of the Soul; which, as they are my own Reflections, might have a better Effect on my&s;elf, at lea&s;t, than better Writings on the &s;ame Subjects. A Collection of E&s;&s;ays, intitled <HI>Spectacle de la

There are al&s;o many Pa&s;&s;ages in the&s;e Writings, e&s;pecially two Let|ters from the Prior to the Chevalier, which are ma&s;terly in their Kind, that are admirable to abate the Self-&s;ufficiency of Man's Pride, and to humble all human Pre&s;umption to a religious and implicit Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion to the infinitely great Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence; before who&s;e Throne let us both kneel, with a pious and virtuous Devotion, not with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic or fanatic Zeal; and from who&s;e Grace may we both receive &s;uch Reward, as &s;hall merit our ju&s;t and hone&s;t Inclinations and Actions toward each other!

<P>The Delays in the Po&s;ts, which you complain of, are owing to this: That, for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, they have gone later out than u&s;ual; &s;o that I had Time to write my Letters in the Morning, and &s;end &s;oon enough: But now, I find, they have recovered their former Dili|gence, which I was not aware of 'till Ye&s;terday Morning.

<P>I have met with a Book lately, which I never heard of before, and that plea&s;es me extremely. It is &s;tiled <HI>Microco&s;mography,</HI> or the Characters of Mankind. It was wrote by Bi&s;hop <HI>Earle,</HI>

Though I receive a very exqui&s;ite Plea&s;ure from &s;eeing him, I cannot help grudging it to my&s;elf, (as I &s;hould any other, un&s;hared by thee) and wi&s;hing he were placed within your View, though I &s;hould, by that Means, be debarred of the only Joy, I am capable of ta&s;ting in your Ab&s;ence. Any Increa&s;e of my Fondne&s;s for your dear little Epitome mu&s;t be &s;uperfluous; and indeed I know nothing that could add to it, but &s;eeing him become as much the Object of your Tenderne&s;s, as he is of mine. I flatter my&s;elf with thinking the happy Time will come, when it &s;hall be doubt|ful, which of us loves him be&s;t.</P>
<P>As I am &s;till very weak, and have not made the lea&s;t Progre&s;s in recovering my Appetite, I &s;hould be very glad to get into the Air for a little Time: But I wait your Orders to di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf in the Country, or wherever el&s;e you plea&s;e.

<P>YOU know I was lately angry: And I am &s;o a&s;hamed of it, that I have been re|collecting what my Reading, or own Reflections can &s;ugge&s;t, fir&s;t, to palliate the Offence for what is pa&s;t; and to prevent, for the future, the ill Effects of a Vice and Weakne&s;s, which I think even I have Sen&s;e and Virtue enough to guard my&s;elf from.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Hints, which I &s;hall offer here, are taken from an E&s;&s;ay upon this very Subject of Anger, wrote by Lord <HI>Verulam.</HI></P>
<P>To extingui&s;h this Pa&s;&s;ion entirely, is but a Bravery of the Stoics: For, like all ill Habits, we mu&s;t cure our&s;elves by Degrees; as a &s;kilful Rider manages an head&s;trong Hor&s;e, guides his Steps in the &s;afe&s;t Cour&s;e, and pulls and relaxes the Rein by Turns. The Rea&s;on that &s;o few People reclaim them&s;elves from bad Affections, is owing more to Want of Judgment, than Virtue. We grow carele&s;s, upon finding the
<PB N="292" REF="293">
Imperfections of human Nature not ea&s;ily con|quered by the Perfection of Philo&s;ophy; not being aware that Habit mu&s;t be overcome by Habit; as Regimen cures chronical Di&s;tempers better than Medicines. Intermi&s;&s;ions are as ne|ce&s;&s;ary in Ethics, as in Phy&s;ic. The Scriptures, which are better Guides in Morals, than the whole Body of Philo&s;ophers, give &s;ome In|dulgence to human Frailty in this Particular: "Be ye angry, but &s;in not." And in another Place,
<Q>Let not the Sun go down upon your Wrath;</Q>
which &s;eems to declare, that the Continuance of Anger, not the fir&s;t Start of it, makes the Vice. <HI>Bacon</HI> &s;ays, the be&s;t Way to cure the natural Inclination or Habit of Re&s;ent|ment, is to reflect upon the Effects of Anger, "how it troubles a Man's Life;" and the be&s;t Time to do this is to look back upon Anger, when the Fit is over. <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;ays well, that
<Q>Anger is like a Ruin, which breaks it&s;elf upon that it falls.</Q>
<HI>Socrates</HI> being a&s;ked what a Man was doing, who was &s;een in the Street chafing him&s;elf in a Rage, an&s;wered ju&s;tly,
<Q>he is puni&s;hing an angry Man.</Q>
The Scripture exhorts us to po&s;&s;e&s;s our Souls in Patience; then whoever is out of Patience, is out of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Soul. A pa&s;&s;ionate Man may be com|pared to a Bee, according to <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ion, that, when they &s;ting, they lo&s;e their Spirit in the Wound. Perhaps this may leave an Open
<PB N="293" REF="294">
to Sarca&s;m, to compare a calm Man to a Drone. <HI>Bacon</HI> &s;ays, it ought to make Men a&s;hamed of Anger, the Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who are mo&s;t &s;ubject to it; Children, Women, old People, and &s;ick Folks. Men &s;hould carry their Re&s;entment rather with Scorn, than Pa&s;&s;ion; e&s;pecially where our Pride is picqued; for that &s;ame Pride &s;hould rather &s;hew us above, than below an Injury or Affront. Many other Ar|guments, drawn from Prudence, Morality, and Religion, occur to me at pre&s;ent; but, I am &s;ure, there are none of them nece&s;&s;ary to inform your Sen&s;e and Under&s;tanding; and all I mean by this E&s;&s;ay, is to furni&s;h you with a few Hints to be offered to my own Con&s;ideration, whenever you find me relap&s;ing into that Weak|ne&s;s, which you may remember in a former Letter, &s;ome Time ago, I mentioned as the only Thing, which, now and then, gets the better of the Tenor of my Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Adieu, my faire&s;t Guide! I a&s;&s;ure you, that I fly to your Arms with all the Impatience of an angry Man, and with all that Good-nature and Affection, which pa&s;&s;ionate Per&s;ons are re|markable for.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ARRIVED here la&s;t Night, much fatigued by the Warmth of the Weather. I hope my Pet is well, and my Pet's Pet. My Ble&s;&s;ing to the little Fellow.</P>
<P>I perceived my Heart growing warm at the Approach to a Place, where I had, twenty Years ago, &s;pent &s;o many chearful, boyi&s;h Days. Somewhat like the Emotion we feel upon meet|ing an old School-fellow; whether it be one we have a particular Attachment to, or no; for I am not &s;peaking here of a rational Affection, but &s;uch a Prejudice and Partiality, as is con|tracted from early Habit and Cu&s;tom, before we have the free Exerci&s;e of our Under&s;tandings. The Love of our Country may be ranked under this Head; by which, I do not mean that Patrioti&s;m, which is but univer&s;al Benevolence, poorly bounded by a Province or Kingdom; but that &s;uper&s;titious Attachment, Men have even to the very Soil, they were born in. I fancy that departed Spirits, even in Bli&s;s, look &s;ome|times back upon this World with a Regard like this, though without any De&s;ire of exchanging Situations. I &s;peak this upon a Pre&s;umption that we carry our Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s with us to the
<PB N="295" REF="296">
next World, which I look upon to be a Thing &s;o far from requiring Proof, that to a&s;&s;ert the contrary is arguing God to be partial or unju&s;t. Should you be rendered a ble&s;&s;ed Spirit for your Virtues, or I an unhappy one for my Vices, you might indeed be &s;aid to be happy, and I mi&s;erable; but neither of us could be &s;aid to be rewarded or puni&s;hed, without a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our being the Per&s;ons, who, in the other Life, had merited or incurred the&s;e Judgments. It is Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, which makes the Identity of a Per&s;on relative to him&s;elf; and, if Death de&s;troys this, it in Effect creates another Spirit in our &s;tead; and to reward or puni&s;h &s;uch a one for our Actions here, would be Partiality or Inju&s;tice. I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to in&s;i&s;t upon an Argument, which, by appearing &s;o obvious to me, makes me conclude has been often urged before; but, as I really never met with any Thing on this Head, at lea&s;t, deducted from this Rea&s;oning, and that it is a Subject you know I am fond of, I &s;hould carry it a good deal farther, if I were writing to any one el&s;e; but your Apprehen&s;ion &s;aves me that Trouble, as it has often done before. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<P>I DID not receive my dear <HI>Harry</HI>'s fir&s;t Letter 'till <HI>Saturday</HI> Evening. I was then at the Rock, and had no po&s;&s;ible Means of &s;ending an An&s;wer to the Po&s;t-office; therefore was obliged, for the fir&s;t Time, to di&s;obey your Commands.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to your Inquiry after mine and my Pet's Health, I mu&s;t tell you, you have been very near lo&s;ing both, &s;ince you left us. I attribute my Illne&s;s to the irregular Way we lived in, the four la&s;t Days you were in Town. I was &s;eized on <HI>Monday</HI> Night with all the Symptoms of a violent Fever: I raved ince&s;&s;antly, and did not recover my Sen&s;es 'till <HI>Tue&s;day. Polly</HI> &s;ent an Expre&s;s to Town, but no one came near us 'till <HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI> I went thro' all the nece&s;&s;ary Operations, and am now, thank God, very well. I came to Town Ye&s;terday, and &s;hall return no more. Poor little Bab has had two Convul&s;ion Fits; the la&s;t was very near carrying him off. They did not let me know of his Illne&s;s, 'till I came to Town. He is va&s;tly altered; but I hope, and believe, he will recover. You may judge (by your own) the Anxiety I feel for him.</P>
<P>I am va&s;tly delighted with your Sentiments in regard to our future Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, as they are, in my Mind, highly conformable to Rea&s;on and Religion: But I am &s;till more charmed with
<PB N="297" REF="298">
them, as they corroborate my darling Hope, that we &s;hall &s;ee, know, and conver&s;e with each other in a future State. For certainly, if we retain a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the Affections and Actions of this Life, we &s;hall likewi&s;e retain the Idea of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who were the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e Actions, for which we are to be pu|ni&s;hed or rewarded. The only Thing, I ever heard objected to this Opinion, is, that &s;uch Remembrances might le&s;&s;en the Happine&s;s of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Spirits, who may, in this Life, be connected by natural or acquired Ties to Per&s;ons, who are to make up the Number of the Unhappy, in the next. To this I an&s;wer, from my own Belief and Hope, that no Soul will be doomed to everla&s;ting Damnation: Or, if there &s;hould be &s;uch unhappy Beings, the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e Crimes, which de&s;erve everla&s;ting Mi&s;ery, would entirely era&s;e the Affection or Regard we bore them, unknowing of their Guilt; and make us readily acknow|ledge, when purged from gro&s;s and &s;elfi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions, that their Doom is ju&s;t. I cannot think, that, even in this Life, there ever did, or will &s;ub&s;i&s;t, a real Friend&s;hip, or &s;incere Affection between the Good and Bad. Virtue alone is the &s;ure Ba&s;is, that can make tho&s;e Unions firm and la&s;ting. Without that only true Foundation, like <HI>E&s;tcourt's</HI> Gue&s;ts,
<Q><PB N="298" REF="299">
<L>They part in Time &mdash;</L>
<L>Whoever hears this my in&s;tructive Song &mdash;</L>
<L>For, tho' &s;uch Friend&s;hips may be dear,</L>
<L>They ne'er continue long.</L></Q>
I have not wrote the&s;e Lines right, but 'tis no great Matter: I have only altered the Form, the Sen&s;e remains.</P>
<P>I received two Letters from you Ye&s;terday. The Compliment, you pay to my Under&s;tand|ing, is more ju&s;tly due to you, than me. If I am &s;en&s;ible, or intelligent, it is you have made me &s;o. The fond De&s;ire of gaining your Approbation fir&s;t rouzed me to exert the little Powers, which Nature lent me. Your Con|ver&s;e, your Letters have improved my Mind, and given my Thoughts a Turn &s;uperior to the Trifles, which employ the Generality of my Sex. Yet &s;till I plead no Merit from this Boa&s;t, for &s;uch a Preceptor mu&s;t have improved the dulle&s;t Pupil. It is you, my charming Guide, who have made me, as far as I am either, wi&s;e or good. You have illu&s;trated your Theory by Practice, and, by your dear Example, &s;hewn me what it is to be a Chri&s;tian and Philo&s;opher. Go on then, my loved Ma&s;ter; continue to in&s;truct, and (I hope) improve me, 'till I arrive as near thy own Perfection, as my &s;mall Powers admit. Yet &s;till remember I am a Woman, nay a weak one too; &s;ubject to all the Failings
<PB N="299" REF="300">
of my Sex, which require Time, as well as Rea&s;on, to conquer.</P>
<P>I am now to thank you for your Concurrence to my Reque&s;t; which I do very &s;incerely; but cannot help &s;aying, tho' without Re&s;entment, that I had rather you had refu&s;ed, than in|hanced the Merit of granting it, by &s;uch unkind Su&s;picions. I thought I had fully explained my Rea&s;ons for de&s;iring, at the Time I mentioned it; tho' perhaps I thought it needle&s;s, as I did not, 'till now, believe my dear <HI>Harry</HI> could think me capable of any mean or &s;elfi&s;h Views. Far from de&s;iring to enlarge the Number of tho&s;e, whom you &s;tile Confidants, I &s;incerely lament the Nece&s;&s;ity, which obliged us to make any; and I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you, I would much rather encounter any Con&s;equence, which might ari&s;e from the World's thinking ill of me, than purcha&s;e their good Opinion, by running the &s;malle&s;t Hazard of injuring you. Nor do I now, nor ever did mean to make any U&s;e of it, on my own Account. My &s;ole Rea&s;on for de&s;iring it, was in regard to a third Per&s;on, who&s;e future Credit, and Happine&s;s in Life, is, I believe, as dear to you, as me. However, if you di&s;tru&s;t my Prudence, or my Confidence in you, I am very ready to re&s;ign this trifling Proof of your's in me; as I would not have you think it can either le&s;&s;en or increa&s;e the &s;incere and unbounded Dependence, I ought to have on you.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="301">I long to know what Succe&s;s you have with the &mdash;. I am glad you did not explain your|&s;elf to &mdash;. There are &s;ome People, who become Enemies from the Time they refu&s;e to be Friends.</P>

I met &s;ome of the Servants of this Hou&s;e about &s;ix Miles off, and they acquainted me with the State of Matters here; which would have been Hint enough for any rea&s;onable Man to turn back upon; but, you know, it was rather a Matter for me to rejoice at, that I &s;hould have &s;o much Time to my&s;elf, my Books, Paper, and Mu&s;ic. The Servants, who are left behind, are the higher Sort; and, as we are unfortunately old Acquaintance, they fall foul on me, from mi&s;taken Kindne&s;s, at an unmerciful Rate.

<Q>we are not our&s;elves, when Nature, being oppre&s;&s;ed, commands the Mind to &s;uffer with the Body.</Q>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL alone &s;till, in my own Kingdom; where, though I have no very exten&s;ive Sway, I have tho&s;e Subjects to govern, that &s;hould be the fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay of a Monarch's Politics, namely, my own Pa&s;&s;ions and Foibles. I might have an&s;wered your Letter la&s;t Po&s;t, but declined it; as I had not Time to do it Ju&s;tice, to &s;peak &s;till in the kingly Stile.</P>
<P>I am extremely plea&s;ed, when you an&s;wer my Letters properly, by entering into the Spirit and Subject of them, which indeed you can do &s;o well; not with
<Q>I received your's, and for An&s;wer &s;ay.</Q></P>
<P>A Corre&s;pondence &s;hould be properly a Con|ver&s;ation; not mere Que&s;tion and An&s;wer. I often ju&s;t hint at Subjects, and leave them imperfect, to give you Occa&s;ion to complete them; and I am vexed and di&s;appointed, when you neglect it, out of Lazine&s;s or Diffidence; for it mu&s;t be owing to either of the&s;e, when|ever I am di&s;appointed. You have &s;ometimes told me, that I over-awe you, from an Appre|hen&s;ion of my &s;uperior Under&s;tanding; &s;o that, in writing or &s;peaking to me, you have not always the full Exerci&s;e of your own Powers.
<PB N="309" REF="310">
Now, for Argument's &s;ake, we will let this pa&s;s; but then believe me, <HI>Fanny,</HI> if I remem|ber right, I had not &s;o refined and &s;peculative Sen&s;e, as you have now, when I was at your Age. All the Improvement, I have ever made to it, has been almo&s;t &s;ince that Time; and a practi&s;ed Wre&s;tler may be able to overcome an inexperienced Man of greater natural Abilities. You are now in a State and Stage of Life proper to improve your&s;elf, and may have this Advantage over me, that you can have the Help of one, who has lately travelled through the Road, you are to go; &s;o that I hope, in Return, to have your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as your Un|der&s;tanding will be at the Height, when mine, from the Cour&s;e of Nature, will be on the Decline. This I &s;hould look upon as a Sort of Triumph, of the mo&s;t flattering Kind, namely, a Conque&s;t over my&s;elf; that is, my better Part overcoming my wor&s;e. Be&s;ides, you have the Advantage of a cha&s;te and religious Education, which will the &s;ooner enable you to reach the only End I have ever propo&s;ed from my Studies, to make me rather a better, than a wi&s;er Man. Moral Philo&s;ophy may reform our Manners, and &s;ubdue our Pa&s;&s;ions; but &s;lowly the one, and with a con&s;tant Struggle the other; while Religion effects the fir&s;t at once, and the latter with Ea&s;e, by &s;ub&s;tituting more charming Plea|&s;ures in their &s;tead.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="311">This is the mo&s;t romantic Place I ever &s;aw: There are not two hundred Yards of level Ground in the whole Country; for it is com|po&s;ed of an infinite Number of green Hills, lying &s;o clo&s;e to each other, that it re&s;embles a Codlin Pye in a Bowl-di&s;h. So that the Nur&s;e's Story of Giants, of old, &s;tepping from one Hill to another, round the Country, would not appear an improbable Tale here. It is much the &s;ame Way at Hermitage too, and, in general, thro' all tho&s;e Parts of this Country, I have yet &s;een.</P>
<P>I hope you are reading <HI>Brown</HI> upon the <HI>Characteri&s;tics,</HI> and writing Notes upon it: I am &s;ure you are, becau&s;e I de&s;ired it. I &s;hould be glad to have your Opinion upon the Definition of Virtue, given in the la&s;t Lines of the third Section of the &s;econd E&s;&s;ay, upon the moral Obligations of Man to Virtue. I give you fair Play, by telling you that I think this Definition fal&s;e and imperfect; and only a&s;k you, how it is &s;o. Read the fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third Sections carefully, before you give your Opinion; not that you will di&s;cover the Error from them, but they will help you to judge the better.</P>
<P>This is a &s;evere Trial of my dear Pupil; for, I own, when fir&s;t I read the Book, I was fully &s;atisfied with the Definition: And, to give you &s;ome Help in this Matter, I agree that he has &s;hewn the Imperfection of the other

<HEAD>LETTER CCCIX.</HEAD>
<P>IN the di&s;agreeable and embarra&s;&s;ed Situation I am at pre&s;ent, I know nothing could tempt me to write, but the Fear of your thinking I poorly declined the Ta&s;k you have a&s;&s;igned me, without being ingenuous enough to confe&s;s my&s;elf unequal to it. I had gone through the whole E&s;&s;ay on the Obligations of Man to Virtue, before I received your Letter; and had remarked the Definition, you mention, to be as <HI>imperfect</HI> as any of tho&s;e, he terms <HI>&s;o:</HI> For which Rea&s;on, I had contented my&s;elf with thinking that Virtue is not to be defined; and had taken up &s;o much of Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI>'s Opinion, as to believe, that though, like the Certainty of an Almighty Being, it cannot be reduced to Terms, or fully proved and explained by Words, yet is it &s;elf-evident to every rational Creature. <HI>Brown</HI> &s;ays, Virtue con&s;i&s;ts
<Q>in the Conformity of our Affections with the public Good, and the voluntary Production of the greate&s;t Hap|pine&s;s&punc;</Q>
If, by the Public, he means all
<PB N="312" REF="313">
human Kind, he might have explained it by <HI>univer&s;al Benevolence</HI>; which is &s;o far from excluding the natural or moral Ties, that it certainly &s;trengthens them.
<Q><L>Friends, Parents, Neighbours fir&s;t it will embrace,</L>
<L>It's Country next, &mdash; and next all human Race.</L></Q>
But, if he confines his Idea of the Public to a particular Nation or People, he doubtle&s;s makes Virtue of a variable and indeterminate Nature; and, at once, de&s;troys his own Sy&s;tem, and it's Exi&s;tence: For, tho' the Love of our Country is certainly a very noble and proper Principle; yet, as the Intere&s;ts of every Nation and People vary, what may be virtuous with regard to the Advantages of one, may be highly criminal by becoming prejudicial to another. This therefore cannot be the true Criterion of Virtue: It's Effects mu&s;t be uniform, independent of Time or Place, as it is it&s;elf the &s;ame in the Vale of <HI>Santone,</HI> or the Palace of <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;till more di&s;plea&s;ed at the latter Part of his Definition,
<Q>the voluntary Production of the greate&s;t Happine&s;s.</Q>
As this may be under&s;tood, poorly confining Virtue to the par|ticular Stations of Affluence or Power. I cannot think this was the Author's Meaning; yet, as it may be wre&s;ted to this Point, I think it is dangerou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed; for it may tend to di&s;|courage
<PB N="313" REF="314">
the Exerci&s;e of Virtue in tho&s;e, who have it not in their Power to do great or generous Actions.</P>
<P>I have now given my dear Preceptor the highe&s;t Proof of my Obedience to his Com|mands; and, as we are told in Scripture, that "Obedience is better than Sacrifice," I hope he will accept the Will for the Deed. Believe me, my deare&s;t Life, I have never been &s;o much hurt at the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own Weakne&s;s, as at this Moment. I know I have expo&s;ed it; but I know I have an indulgent Ma&s;ter, who will forgive and in&s;truct me. From the fir&s;t of our Corre&s;pondence, I have ever declined writing, tho' I was vain enough of my Capacity in that Way before; but the Perfection of your Letters has &s;hewn me my In&s;ufficiency in &s;uch a glaring Light, that I never &s;it down to an&s;wer a Letter of your's, without blu&s;hing. You &s;ay, I am now
<Q>at an Age, and in a State of Life, to admit Improvement.</Q>
My Age is doubtle&s;s on your Side, but my Situation much again&s;t you. The Quickne&s;s of my Apprehen&s;ion, which is, or &s;hould be my be&s;t Help to &s;tudy, is turned to melancholy Pro&s;pects, and my Attention to any Thing I read continually interrupted, as I never am one Moment alone.</P>

<P>YOU cannot imagine what Plea&s;ure your Critique upon <HI>Brown</HI> gives me.

<P>Indeed, my Dear, I intreat you to exert your Talents a little oftener in this Way; for you may be a&s;&s;ured, that, if I did not think you equal to the Ta&s;k, I would not recommend it to you.

<P>AS my dear <HI>Harry</HI> knows the Unea&s;ine&s;s, which his Silence gives me, I cannot help &s;aying it is more than unkind, it is ab&s;olutely cruel, to neglect writing. There was a Report la&s;t Week, that you died &s;uddenly. I heard it la&s;t <HI>Friday</HI>; and my not receiving a Letter from you that Day almo&s;t di&s;tracted me. Tho' your Letters are the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and elegant Plea&s;ure I can receive in your Ab&s;ence, yet is my Affec|tion &s;o much &s;tronger than my Under&s;tanding, that I would willingly give up the Entertainment they afford me, to be certain of a &s;ingle Line by every Po&s;t, which &s;hould barely tell me you are well. I know it is a Weakne&s;s to expect &s;uch exact Punctuality; but it is the natural Effect of a <HI>greater,</HI> the having &s;o entirely given up my Heart, as to render my Happine&s;s wholly dependent on you; a Tru&s;t, for which (contrary to the general Opinion) you can, with Ea&s;e, give me &s;ufficient Security.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="317">I received your two Letters of the former Po&s;ts; and think it is really &s;omething extra|ordinary, that a Per&s;on, who was bred and has lived like you, &s;hould, at your Time of Life, (immer&s;ed in Bu&s;ine&s;s, and involved in di&s;agree|able Circum&s;tances) without any outward Call, or vi&s;ible Help, become &s;o great a Proficient in a Science, which to the Generality of the World appears &s;o tedious and ab&s;tru&s;e, as to deter them from being at all acquainted with it; and in which many learned (and from thence called wi&s;e) Men have pa&s;&s;ed their Lives, with|out either making them&s;elves, or the World, one whit the better for it. In &s;hort, I look upon it as a particular Mark of the Almighty's Goodne&s;s, that has been plea&s;ed to give you a Turn of Mind, which mu&s;t render you &s;uperior to the common Accidents of Life; and that he has thought proper to make you an In&s;tance, among the few, that neither Riches, Power, nor Honours are nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute the real Happine&s;s of a rational Being; &s;ince, with a Ta&s;te and Reli&s;h for them all, yet unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any of them, your State is infinitely preferable to tho&s;e, who, in the full Enjoyment of them all, are unble&s;t with true Religion and Philo&s;ophy.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU de&s;ired to hear from me on <HI>Friday</HI>; but tho&s;e, who love, are fond of Works of Supererogation.</P>
<P>I am reading one of the Books, I brought away from you, intitled <HI>Manners,</HI> and am well plea&s;ed with it. I remember the Rea&s;on of my throwing it a&s;ide, when I bought it for you, was, upon looking a little into it, I ob&s;erved the Author had alluded to a great Number of private Characters, to illu&s;trate general Theorems; and, as I had &s;ometimes met with many in&s;ipid moral Novels of that Kind, I conceived a Prejudice again&s;t the Book: But I find, from this Author, that, when &s;uch a Manner is managed with Wit and Addre&s;s, it gives a certain Vivacity to this Kind of Writings, and &s;trengthens the Stile, by adding Action to Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>What incited my Inclination to read this Book, was a Paragraph in the public Papers, that it had given great Offence in <HI>France,</HI> where it was written, and that there was likely to be
<PB N="318" REF="319">
a Pro&s;ecution again&s;t the Author; and, as far as I have gone, I find it has a Merit in it very apt to give Offence to Prie&s;ts and Bigots. The Writer is, I think, a Man of Sen&s;e, Learning, Parts, and unprejudiced Reflections. I am, therefore, highly plea&s;ed to find he is of the &s;ame Opinion with me, of an innate Idea of irrelative Virtue; which is a Sentiment I am &s;o charmed with, that I am fond of laying hold on every Occa&s;ion of di&s;cour&s;ing about it. So I &s;hall here take a Flight at it again.</P>
<P>We have, from the mere Beauty of Nature, a Smell for Flavours, a Ta&s;te for Savours, a Sight for Symmetry, an Hearing for Sounds, and a Feeling for more &s;en&s;ual Gratifications. Shall then the Goodne&s;s, nay the Ju&s;tice of God leave us void of as immediate a Sen&s;ation of Virtue, which is a Thing of &s;o much higher Con&s;equence both to our&s;elves and others, and both with regard to this Life and the next? Shall, I &s;ay, the Bounty of God be greater than his Ju&s;tice? Shall our in&s;tinct Faculties be governed by a divine Impul&s;e, and &s;hall our moral Powers be left without a Guide? for human Rea&s;on is in&s;ufficient to form the Rule, tho' it's proper Province is to be exerci&s;ed, and conver&s;ant about it.</P>
<P>But the Sen&s;es are only the Organs to convey Ideas to the Mind; it is the Soul, which per|ceives. Brutes then have a Soul: They have
<PB N="319" REF="320">
al&s;o a Spirit, if you give me Leave to make a Di&s;tinction here; for Matter, of it&s;elf, is inactive. There are &s;o many In&s;tances in Brutes of what we partially &s;tile little, mimic Rea&s;on, that Mankind has no great Cau&s;e to be vain upon the &s;ole Prerogative of this Excellence; &s;ince all we can claim is but a higher Degree of this boa&s;ted Superiority.</P>
<P>But we are taught to believe that God formed Man after his own Image: This Favour &s;urely was not &s;hewn in his human Figure, which <HI>Diogenes</HI> humourou&s;ly ridiculed, by plucking a Goo&s;e, and leading it through the Streets of <HI>Athens,</HI> crying, "Behold <HI>Plato</HI>'s Man!" which that Philo&s;opher had defined to be a two-legged Animal without Feathers. Nor can this glorious Characteri&s;tic be pre&s;umed from any one Quality, which Brutes have in any Degree or Analogy with us. What then is this great Di&s;tinction, upon which we do, and ought &s;o ju&s;tly to value our&s;elves, but a certain, innate, moral Sen&s;e, which, as the Serpent expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q>makes us as Gods, knowing Good from Evil?</Q></P>
<P>Brutes are capable of Virtue, according to the common Sen&s;e of it; for many of their Actions demon&s;trate Love, Gratitude, and Benevolence: And though, when the Spaniel beats the Field for our Sport or Food, he may be con&s;idered as acting merely for his own Plea&s;ure; this is no more than &s;ome Morali&s;ts have charged upon
<PB N="320" REF="321">
human Virtue, which they have re&s;olved into a Self-&s;atisfaction. In &s;hort, it is an innate, moral Idea, which makes us <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> of Virtue; while Rea&s;on and free Will only make us capa|ble of it.</P>

<P>I WOULD not tell you any thing of the Matter, 'till it was over; but I left Town with a &s;ore Throat, which increa&s;ed very fa&s;t upon me, la&s;t Night; but I am this Morning, thank God, as well as ever, and am ju&s;t &s;etting out for your own <HI>Belvidere.</HI></P>
<P>I have gone a good Way in <HI>Manners</HI>; and, upon a farther View in that Author, I begin to find the &s;ame Fault with him, which I did at fir&s;t. His Characters are too frequently intro|duced, are tedious, and ill drawn, and many of them not at all to the Purpo&s;e. However, there are here and there certain Traits of Genius, which, upon the whole, make the Work appear to have been written by two different Per&s;ons; or rather, I have taken it into my Head, that
<PB N="321" REF="322">
it was wrote by a Woman, who had, for &s;ome Time, conver&s;ed freely with &s;en&s;ible Men.</P>
<P>The Author, Authors, or Compiler of this Book &s;peaks very rationally again&s;t the Doctrine of eternal Mi&s;ery; which is a Matter, I think, I have in &s;ome of my Letters given my Opinion upon; and is a Subject I am &s;o fond of, that I &s;hall venture to &s;peak the Sentiments, which at pre&s;ent occur to me on that Head, without waiting to recollect whether I have &s;aid the &s;ame Things to you before or no, or whether any one has &s;aid them before me.</P>
<P>The Doctrine of eternal Mi&s;ery e&s;tabli&s;hes the Empire of the Devil; for twenty Men mu&s;t be damned, for one that can be &s;aved, upon the orthodox Chri&s;tian Scheme; and the Mediator has &s;uffered in vain.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, during the Millennium of the Ju&s;t, there &s;hould be a Millennium of the Unju&s;t &mdash; don't you think a thou&s;and Years Sufferings may make &s;ufficient Atonement to divine Ju&s;tice? And I think the popi&s;h Doctrine of Purgatory only ab&s;urd in the Opinion, that any Merits of the Living can avail the Dead there. How|ever, this wild Notion may be con&s;idered as a pious Fraud to be of Service in Religion, as it multiplies our Inducements to Devotion &mdash; As for Example; If I thought my dear <HI>Fanny</HI> was receiving many Stripes there for her Cro&s;&s;ne&s;s to me, no Anchorite ever led &s;uch an exemplary
<PB N="322" REF="323">
Life, as I &s;hould, to re&s;cue my own &s;poiled Pet.</P>
<P>Infinite Ju&s;tice, they &s;ay, requires infinite Satisfaction. Perhaps this is only a Quibble upon Words: But, to take it their own Way, has not the Mediator's Suffering already given this infinite Satisfaction? and mu&s;t every mi&s;er|able Wretch, who dies in Sin, become an additional Victim to infinite Ju&s;tice? In &s;hort, this &s;hocking Doctrine &s;eems rather to be a Piece of Prie&s;t's Rage, than divine Wrath; and is &s;uch a bla&s;phemous Opinion of the Godhead, as exceeds almo&s;t any of tho&s;e Lay Crimes, they anathematize &s;o vehemently and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly at the &s;ame Time; and are not aware that they reduce God to a Kind of Fate, while, by extending his Ju&s;tice, they limit his Mercy, and &s;o peremptorily de&s;troy the Power of free Will in the Exerci&s;e of his Attributes. But I cannot let this <HI>infinite</HI> Satisfaction pa&s;s by &s;o quietly, without &s;hewing that it proves nothing, by proving too much; for infinite Satisfaction mu&s;t be infinite every Way, in Degree as well as Duration; then this de&s;troys the equitable Rule of proportionable Puni&s;hments; for the lea&s;t Crime requires Satisfaction, infinite Satis|faction, infinite in Degree, and infinite in Du|ration &mdash; &s;o that a Man mu&s;t be made a God, before he can be rendered capable of giving &s;uch infinite Satisfaction.</P>

<P>I have fini&s;hed <HI>Manners,</HI> and &s;till think of that Book, as I did in my la&s;t; and could point out &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages, to &s;hew that it is rather a Collection, than an original Work.

who have wrote ju&s;tly upon the &s;ame Subject; but what I would in&s;tance, are particular Turns of Thought and Expre&s;&s;ion, which I have met with before. There is one among them taken from <HI>Monte&s;quieu</HI>'s <HI>Per&s;ian Letters:</HI>
<Q>That it appears more rea&s;onable, that the Minority, in&s;tead of the Majority, &s;hould determine a Que&s;tion; for ten Men think wrong, for one who judges right.</Q>
The only Difference between this Whim in the <HI>Lettres Per&s;anes,</HI> and this Book, is, that <HI>Monte&s;quieu</HI> only threw out this Sentiment as a Stroke of Fancy; but our Morali&s;t &s;eems to advance it as a grave Argument, and &s;upports it by a Text from <HI>Exodus,</HI> di&s;ingenuou&s;ly quoted.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FORGOT to mention to you, in my la&s;t, another remarkable Pa&s;&s;age in our moral Plagiari&s;t; even <HI>Pope</HI>'s much-admired Simile of a Stone thrown into a &s;tanding Lake, verbatim, except the Rhyme.</P>
<P>But let us have done with him, for he inter|rupted me la&s;t Po&s;t in the Pro&s;ecution of my Argument upon eternal Mi&s;ery; and how, or how far, I rea&s;oned upon that Subject, I do not recollect at pre&s;ent; for I have been deep involved in Affairs of this World, &s;ince I came home: But I &s;hall proceed as Thoughts now occur, without Regard to Order; as you know I take the Liberty with you of making my Letters a Sort of Common-Place-Book. Not that I de&s;ire any Writer &s;hould &s;ee, or expect they would borrow any Thing from the&s;e rude E&s;&s;ays, which I find an Amu&s;ement to revolve in my own Mind, and a Plea&s;ure to communicate to you, for whom alone I write, tho' it is for both our &s;akes I read.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant that the Scriptures are full of penal Threats; but I do not remember that they are denounced to all Eternity: Nay I think the contrary is implied in a Text, which the Popi&s;h Clergy quote for Purgatory;
<Q>there to
<PB N="327" REF="328">
remain, 'till thou ha&s;t paid the uttermo&s;t Farthing.</Q>
It is an Allu&s;ion made to the State of a Debtor. I am afraid that even eternal Happine&s;s is not fully promi&s;ed in the Scriptures, which &s;urely is a more rea&s;onable Faith than the other; and that this glorious Hope is rather a moral Pre&s;umption than a divine Revelation. Our principal Arguments upon this Head are drawn from the perfect Goodne&s;s of God, the Analogy running through all his Works. The natural Frame of the human Soul, it's frequent Satiety of all worldly Enjoyments, (except alone it's Contemplation of the Divine Nature,) it's earne&s;t Longings after that &s;upreme, elevated, and complete Bli&s;s, and a certain natural Sym|pathy, the virtuous and religious Mind feels to be again allied to &s;ome more excellent Nature, which it &s;eems to have, as it were, a Sen&s;e of being lately &s;eparated from. I think it may be rationally inferred from all this, that, to &s;atisfy the natural Frame of &s;uch a Soul, it's Bli&s;s mu&s;t be eternal; for Plea&s;ures not made to cloy can give no Satiety. Now extend, rather &s;ay limit, our heavenly Bli&s;s to the millionth Power of a millionth Myriad of Years, which is almo&s;t infinitely beyond the Art of Numbers to enumerate; yet even the immediate Bli&s;s of the &s;ublimed Spirit would be, from that Re|flection, rendered imperfect; as, the higher our Happine&s;s in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the more &s;en&s;ibly are
<PB N="328" REF="329">
we affected at even the mo&s;t remote Thought of parting with it. And I &s;hould prefer my State even in this vile World, &s;atiated with frail, mortal Joys, and oppre&s;&s;ed with life-long Cares, but pre&s;uming upon the great Hope of a glorious Immortality, to the mo&s;t &s;ublime Plea&s;ures of the next, limited in Pro&s;pect even one Thought &s;hort of Eternity. Shall we lo&s;e our earne&s;t Reli&s;h, our virtuous Longing after Immortality in a State of certain Bli&s;s, which operates &s;o emphatically in our Souls, even while the Vices of the Body, and the Corruption of the Heart, occa&s;ion that Thought to be attended with a Dread of what Eternity we may be doomed to? or may the Soul, in perfect Bli&s;s, have one De&s;ire ungratified? In &s;hort, to bring this heart-tran&s;porting, metaphy&s;ic-in&s;piring Subject as near to Demon&s;tration as po&s;&s;ible, let me pre&s;ume to argue thus: If the Souls of Men are not im|mortal, God has granted us le&s;s Happine&s;s, than we are capable of, which is contrary to our Notion of God,
<Q>with whom is Fulne&s;s of Joy, and Plea&s;ure for evermore.</Q></P>
<P>Thus Man has a rational Prae-&s;entiment of future Bli&s;s, and a rational Deduction of it's Eternity; but he has neither one or the other with regard to future Mi&s;ery, or it's Eternity. The only Dread, which appears to me natural to the Mind of Man, is that very &s;hocking one of Annihilation.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="330">What I mean is, that Man has not any natural Forebodings of future Mi&s;ery, tho' his Rea&s;on may draw &s;ome Inference about it: But then this Rea&s;on can never conclude for eternal Puni&s;hments; and his Faith mu&s;t be blind, who could credit that Religion, which adhibited &s;uch a Revelation.</P>
<P>So that the Doctrine of Puni&s;hments re&s;ts merely upon what Revelation is made about them; which, as I hinted before, does not de|nounce them eternal, at lea&s;t the Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Nay I think farther, that, tho' Rewards may be agreeable to divine Ju&s;tice, Puni&s;hments are not. If I remember right, I &s;aid &s;omething upon this Subject to you in a former Letter, by alluding to human Laws; &s;o &s;hall in&s;i&s;t on it no farther here: But, to take away all Cavil from this Paradox, and to treat this Subject more equally, I &s;hall deny that either Rewards or Puni&s;hments, tho' allowed in the moral Sen&s;e, are agreeable to divine Goodne&s;s or Ju&s;tice, in the legi&s;lative Sen&s;e; and perhaps I may argue in concert with the Scripture too.</P>
<P>The Plea&s;ing or Di&s;plea&s;ing of God are but figurative Expre&s;&s;ions, which, taken in a literal Sen&s;e, have occa&s;ioned the Terms of Rewards and Puni&s;hments; for thus are divine Matters confounded and impured, by drawing Analogies between them and human Things. Now our good or bad Actions relate entirely to our own
<PB N="330" REF="331">
Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery; and would it not be partial to be&s;tow a Reward, where there can po&s;&s;ibly be no Merit? for, as the Scripture &s;ays,
<Q>after all we &s;hall be but unprofitable Servants:</Q>
As it would be cruel to inflict a Puni&s;hment, where Ignorance, Pa&s;&s;ion, or Temptation may lead a Man into Vice; for, as the &s;ame Scripture &s;ays, "where little is given, little &s;hall be expected."</P>
<P>I would not hazard this Subject, &s;o unfini&s;hed, to any Hands but your's, as I am obliged to break off in a very dangerous Cri&s;is; but the Night is far &s;pent, and next Po&s;t &s;hall be em|ployed to extract the Poi&s;on.</P>

<DIV2 N="317" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER CCCXVII.</HEAD>
<P>I THINK then, with &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Divines, that Rewards and Puni&s;hments are not be|&s;towed or inflicted upon our Actions, good or bad; but that Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery is the pre|ordained Con&s;equence of Virtue or Vice; and that, as natural Virtue or Vice, as Temperance and Exerci&s;e, or Intemperance and Inactivity, produce Health or Di&s;ea&s;e in this World, &s;o moral Virtue or Vice as e&s;&s;entially are attended with Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery in the next.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="332">Now, if our Portions hereafter be general moral Con&s;equences, and not particular ju&s;ticiary Adaptions, I can perceive no Rea&s;on how the Soul of Man can be, at any Time, precluded from redeeming it&s;elf by a thorough Contrition, and &s;incere Repentance; or that a Halter or a Quin&s;ey &s;hall be &s;ufficient to deprive it of Bli&s;s, to all Eternity: For a Spirit, at any Period of it's Exi&s;tence, reclaimed to a full and perfect Sen&s;e, Love, and Adoration of the E&s;&s;ence, Truth, Goodne&s;s, and Power of God, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily attract to it&s;elf that Happine&s;s, which is e&s;&s;entially allied to &s;uch a State of Mind.</P>
<P>But &s;ome &s;evere Divines may here object, that a departed Spirit can po&s;&s;ibly have no Merit in Contrition or Repentance, when Temptation to Sin is no more, and when the con&s;equential Mi&s;ery is demon&s;tratively a&s;certained, and &s;everely experienced. To which, Part of my la&s;t Letter may be an An&s;wer, where the Merit of Virtue is denied; and the Beginning of this Letter may be referred to, where Happine&s;s is &s;aid to be the Con&s;equence, not the Reward of Virtue. And, as we are taught to believe that higher Spirits than our's have been plunged into the Aby&s;s for Sin, in the next World; why may we not hope that a poor human Soul may be capable of emerging from thence, by Righteou&s;ne&s;s here|after? for &s;urely Religion is not limited, either in Place or Time, to the narrow Bounds and
<PB N="332" REF="333">
&s;hort Duration of this paltry Globe; but extends it&s;elf thro' the whole Univer&s;e of Intelligence, and &s;hall continue to all Eternity.</P>
<P>I look upon this Life to be a State of Trial, and the next to be a State of Purgation, from which, perhaps, the mo&s;t perfect Man may not be exempt: For Vengeance is not of the E&s;&s;ence of God; but his Nature is &s;o pure, that no Spirit may approach the Throne of his Grace, ob&s;cured by Stain or Blemi&s;h; and a State of thorough Purgation, that is, of &s;incere Repen|tance, without Temptation to Sin, is nece&s;&s;ary to prepare us for the Bli&s;s of Angels. So that I look upon the Devil's Empire to be of this World only, and not extended to the next; for here he may tempt, but there he cannot.</P>
<P>I think, then, that a Soul purged from Sin, by any Method, is a proper Object of the Divine Favour.
<Q>Whom the Lord loveth, he cha&s;teneth.</Q>
Can Cha&s;ti&s;ement then be deemed the Effect of Hatred, in the Lord, "who hateth nothing, which he has made?" And does not a Father cordially love a Son, whom he has reclaimed by Di&s;cipline? Is not the Penitence of a Sinner accepted of by God, tho' effected by Pain, Poverty, or other Mis|fortune in this Life? Shall the whole heavenly Ho&s;t rejoice over a repentant Sinner in this World; and &s;hall the Circum&s;tance of Time or Place deprive them of Charity, when our
<PB N="333" REF="334">
Souls become more nearly allied to them, than in the Fle&s;h?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, if Puni&s;hments, or Mi&s;ery, either judiciary or con&s;equential, be eternal, in any one In&s;tance, the Devil has triumphed &s;o far; which is Bla&s;phemy: But, according to the Severity of &s;ome Divines, there can be but a &s;mall Minority &s;aved; which would look like a very paltry Compo&s;ition for the Redeemer of Mankind to make.</P>
<P>If this Doctrine may appear to &s;et Men too free from Terror, to influence their Conduct toward a virtuous Life, I &s;hall con&s;ider this Subject in that Light, in another Letter; and do a&s;&s;ure you, my deare&s;t Ally, that I am as &s;incerely attached to you, as if I thought my Salvation depended upon it. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCCXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE my la&s;t Letter I have looked into the Bible, and find &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages, where eternal Puni&s;hments are denounced; but then I find al&s;o &s;everal other Places, where the Words <HI>eternal</HI> and <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> are meant in a limited Sen&s;e, for a long and indefinite Time. So that I think the&s;e Texts do not preclude me from rea&s;oning upon this Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="335">I own, the fir&s;t Thing which occurred to me, when I met with Expre&s;&s;ions in the Scripture, that &s;eemed to &s;hock my Rea&s;on, and my Idea of God, was, to &s;uppo&s;e them only Threats <HI>in Terrorem</HI>; but then this alarmed me about the Con&s;equence, which &s;uch a Surmi&s;e might draw after it, with regard to the Promi&s;es mentioned in the &s;ame Scripture. However, upon Recol|lection, I did not think this Inference &s;hould logically follow; for a Promi&s;e is a Contract, the virtuous Man a Purcha&s;er, and Ju&s;tice exacts the Obligation: But the Ca&s;e is quite different with regard to Threats. A Lord may &s;ay to his Steward,
<Q>Tend well this Farm 'till my Return, and I will make thee an Inheritance out of it; but, if you &s;uffer the Soil to be over-grown with Briars, I will cau&s;e thee to be flayed alive.</Q>
Now, tho' the Lord mu&s;t fulfil his Promi&s;e out of Ju&s;tice, he &s;urely may forgive the Penalty out of Mercy.</P>
<P>But I do not mean to in&s;i&s;t upon this Argu|ment; for, as the Texts I hint at may be &s;o interpreted as to agree with the Rea&s;oning of my former Letters, I &s;hould be very tender of charging the lea&s;t Di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s upon the Words of God; and, if they were expre&s;s and uncontrovertible in this or any other Particular, again&s;t my Sen&s;e or Opinion, I would, as becomes me, &s;ubmit my Rea&s;on to my Faith. And indeed, tho' the Di&s;tinction I have made
<PB N="335" REF="336">
between Promi&s;es and Threats, does &s;ufficiently prove that Ju&s;tice or Rea&s;on does not require the Completion of denounced Vengeance, yet certainly <HI>Truth</HI> requires that every Thing &s;hall be, as it is affirmed.</P>
<P>In order to help us the better to frame a Judgment upon this Subject, let us take the Matter as high as we can, by beginning at original Sin; and yet all the Cur&s;e, we hear, upon that Occa&s;ion, &s;eems to be Temptation, Labour, and Death, (<HI>Gene&s;is</HI> iii.15, and to the End.) That is, it may be apprehended, that the natural Con&s;equence of the fir&s;t Parent's Sin was the deba&s;ing human Nature to a State of Frailty, Mechanics, and Mortality; which imperfect Nature was, from thence, derived down to all their Race:
<Q>For an evil Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit.</Q></P>
<P>Our Redeemer afterwards, at a certain Time, (though re&s;olved from the Beginning) takes our Nature upon him, (and is thence &s;tiled our &s;econd <HI>Adam</HI>) by which benevolent and godlike Conde&s;cen&s;ion Mankind was retrieved to their former Dignity, &s;o far as to be rendered capable of their former Perfection, perhaps greater; in which the whole My&s;tery of the Incarnation &s;eems to lie, not in the unaccountable Doctrine of &s;atisfying the Divine Ju&s;tice; which Doctrine has perplexed the Faith of many well-di&s;po&s;ed Chri&s;tians, and, perhaps, has prevented this
<PB N="336" REF="337">
Religion from becoming as univer&s;al, as it's other Evidence, and moral Perfection, &s;eems to promi&s;e.</P>
<P>That Mankind &s;hould labour under Guilt, for the Sin of our fir&s;t Parents, and that they &s;hould be redeemed by the Sacrifice of God; the fir&s;t not our Crime, and the latter not our Merit; &s;eems to be a Scheme of Providence contrary to Sen&s;e or Religion: But that a Race of Beings, proceeding from <HI>Adam,</HI> after his Fall, &s;hould con&s;equentially be of too corrupt a Nature to be capable of perfect Bli&s;s; and that our Redeemer, becoming our &s;econd Parent, a Man every Way, (Sin only excepted) &s;hould thereby re&s;tore that Purity to our Nature, as may render it capable of perfect Happine&s;s, is, in my Opinion, a Doctrine agreeable to meta|phy&s;ical Philo&s;ophy, reconcileable to the Nature of Things, to the eternal Laws of God; and likewi&s;e vindicates him from the Charge of Vengeance or Partiality, as the whole Con&s;e|quences &s;eem to proceed from the original Formation of Things.</P>
<P>From all which Rea&s;oning, I &s;hall venture to conclude again&s;t eternal Puni&s;hments: For, in the fir&s;t In&s;tance, at the Fall, even temporary ones are not threatened <HI>in futuro</HI>; and, in the &s;econd In&s;tance, at Man's Redemption, if they became &s;o then, how many wretched Souls would be Lo&s;ers by the Bargain! and Chri&s;t
<PB N="337" REF="338">
may be &s;aid to have overcome Death only, by his Sacrifice, but not to have conquered Sin.</P>
<P>The&s;e few Thoughts occurring to me, when I &s;at down to write, have obliged me to defer my Promi&s;e in my la&s;t, 'till the next Po&s;t.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now retired from the Grand Jury, to perform a Promi&s;e I have delayed for &s;ome Po&s;ts, and think an A&s;&s;izes a proper Time to di&s;cour&s;e about <HI>Judgment to come.</HI></P>
<P>When I fir&s;t entered upon this Subject, I own I trembled, as <HI>Felix</HI> did, for fear of the Con|&s;equence of my Doctrine; therefore I canva&s;&s;ed the Matter a good deal in my own Mind, before I ventured to treat upon it even to you; tho' I was perfectly certain that the Notion of eternal Mi&s;ery could not add any thing to the Strength of your Virtue, tho' it might, perhaps, take away &s;omewhat of the Merit of it. The Rea&s;ons, then, which &s;uffered me to proceed, were the&s;e.</P>
<P>If I argued ju&s;tly, which I endeavoured to do, I cannot apprehend any ill Con&s;equence from
<PB N="338" REF="339">
my Subject. Truth cannot injure Truth; and Error is not nece&s;&s;ary to bring about the Ends or De&s;igns of Providence.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay that the Propitiation of our Saviour was &s;elf-&s;ufficient to redeem us totally; but that it did not leave us in a wor&s;e State under the Go&s;pel, than it found us under the Law, (which, with regard to the many, it would have done, upon this Doctrine;) and only enabled us to work out our own Salvation, but I do not think it has limited the Time.</P>
<P>I think that the &s;evere Divines endeavour to prove too much: For, as there is no proportional Ju&s;tice in eternal Mi&s;ery, Men may &s;u&s;pect the whole Scheme, from one Flaw, to be but a pious Fraud to deter from Vice; but, when Mi&s;ery is taught to be the natural Con&s;equence of Vice, Damnation may appear to be unavoid|able, unle&s;s the Great, Immutable Being &s;hall contradict his eternal Laws; which is ab&s;urd, and &s;till le&s;s to be expected in Favour of a Sinner.</P>
<P>The Terror of eternal Torments either drives Men to De&s;pair, and &s;o does more Harm than Good; or is balanced by the Hope of Mercy, in Proportion to it's Fear, and &s;o is de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>A Man would certainly, with more Prudence, put him&s;elf into the Power of a provoked Enemy, than expo&s;e him&s;elf naked to an ea&s;terly Wind;
<PB N="339" REF="340">
becau&s;e, in one Ca&s;e, &s;omething might be hoped from Genero&s;ity and Mercy; but, in the other, he mu&s;t expect the natural Con&s;equence of his Indi&s;cretion and Folly.</P>
<P>I think the Doctrine, as it &s;tands in the Ortho|doxy, &s;avours too much of human Politics; and the mixing profane with &s;acred Things has often a dangerous Tendency.</P>
<P>Some Divines argue very unfairly, and un|comfortably too, upon the Obligations of Man to Virtue, by attributing it to Hope and Fear; as if Rewards and Puni&s;hments were, as an <HI>Allay,</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to make the too refined Idea of it permanent, and fit for U&s;e. But &s;urely the Love of Virtue is not Hope, nor is the Abhorrence of Vice, Fear; though the&s;e very di&s;tinct Ideas &s;eem to be confounded by their Definition.</P>
<P>I believe that any Man, who has ob&s;erved the lea&s;t upon the Motions of the human Mind, has, at &s;everal Times of his Life, perceived a certain Impul&s;e to &s;ome Actions, and a Sort of Unwillingne&s;s to others, though both, in all human Appearance, indifferent in them&s;elves; nay, &s;ometimes the&s;e &s;ecret Intimations have moved us contrary to the mo&s;t obvious Rea&s;on about &s;uch Things; but in a little Time per|haps the Genius of the&s;e intimate Directions has manife&s;ted it&s;elf in &s;ome remarkable Event
<PB N="340" REF="341">
of our Lives, unfore&s;een, and improbable at that Time.</P>
<P>Is it rea&s;onable then to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch Hints &s;hould be afforded us in Things merely relative to our Lives or Fortunes in this World, and that we &s;hould be left without &s;ome unerring Guide or Impul&s;e with regard to Virtue, upon which our nobler Fortunes and immortal Lives depend? The&s;e inward Workings of the Spirit, this natural Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, this Self-evidence, which I have, at &s;everal Times, &s;uppo&s;ed in the Mind of Man, I am well convinced, have, in general, a &s;tronger Effect toward the Influence of Virtue, than all the Art of Logic, &s;upported by the Doctrine of eternal Mi&s;ery. For my Part, I have been often guilty of Vice, with all the Fear and Trembling of an orthodox Chri&s;tian; and have, at other Times, been capable of Virtue, without the lea&s;t Contemplation about Hope.</P>
<P>As true Religion con&s;i&s;ts in the perfect Love of God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. <HI>Mark</HI> &s;ays of the Love of God,
<Q>This is the fir&s;t Commandment.</Q></NOTE>, I do not &s;ee how Fear is, any way, nece&s;&s;ary to Piety; except that be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t of all Fears, which proceeds from extreme Love.
<Q>There is Mercy with thee; therefore &s;halt thou be feared.</Q>
And I cannot help joining
<PB N="341" REF="342">
with <HI>Shaft&s;bury,</HI> who &s;ays,
<Q>that Prie&s;ts have made Religion &s;o very &s;elfi&s;h, that I do not &s;ee, after all, what Merit there is in it worth rewarding.</Q>
Fear may deter from Vice, but can never conduce to Virtue.</P>
<P>The le&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e the Deity capable of Cruelty or Revenge, the higher our Love mu&s;t naturally ri&s;e; and it is certain that Mankind is apt to undertake nobler and more difficult Actions from the Spirit of Love, than from the Pa&s;&s;ion of Fear. There is a Courage in our Natures, which &s;purns at Fear; but a Tender|ne&s;s in our Frames, which di&s;po&s;es to Love: And, if any Man is ba&s;e enough to be in|fluenced by Terror, it is becau&s;e he has not had his Mind &s;ufficiently imbued with more worthy Principles; and, in this Ca&s;e, which is corrupt Morals, it is too often found that even Fear will have no Avail. In&s;tances are num|berle&s;s of moral Pagans, independent of Hope: For, tho' in the Writings of the Antients there are very fine Rea&s;onings upon a future Life, and Retributions of Ju&s;tice; yet the&s;e appear to be rather the <HI>Effect</HI> of their Philo&s;ophy, than the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of their Virtue.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits have a bla&s;phemous Tenet with regard to Communicants:
<Q>That Attrition alone, which proceeds merely from the Fear of Hell-Torments, without Contrition, which
<PB N="342" REF="343">
comprehends the Love of God, is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify a Sinner at the Sacrament.</Q></P>
<P>I will here give you &s;ome of the truly religious Sentiments of Father <HI>Que&s;nel,</HI> which I think regard this Subject; and, in order to rai&s;e your E&s;teem for them, I need only tell you, they are &s;ome of the Propo&s;itions condemned by the infamous Bull <HI>Unigenitus.</HI></P>
<P><Q>As Sin proceeds from a mi&s;taken Love of our&s;elves, &s;o Virtue proceeds from a true Love of God.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Fear &s;tops only the Hand; but the Heart remaineth adherent to Sin, as long as it is not directed by the Love of Ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He, who refrains from Evil only out of Fear of Puni&s;hment, commits it in his Heart, and is already guilty of it before God.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He, who is baptized, is yet under the Law, even as a <HI>Jew,</HI> if he doth not fulfil it, or if he fulfil it only thro' Fear.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the Prophets, the Prie&s;ts, and the Doctors of the Law are dead, without &s;ending any Children to God, &s;ince they have made Slaves, but thro' Fear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They, that are under the Cur&s;e of the Law, do no Good; becau&s;e it is equal Sin to do Evil, or to &s;hun it thro' Fear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He, that approacheth God, &s;hould not come to him with brutal Pa&s;&s;ions; nor be

led by In&s;tinct or Fear, as Bea&s;ts, but by Faith and Love, as Children.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Slavi&s;h Fear repre&s;ents God as a &s;evere, imperious, unju&s;t, and unmerciful Ma&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>To all which I &s;hall add, that Fear may make good Citizens, but Love alone makes good Chri&s;tians. And, upon the whole, I really think that in my Doctrine there is My&s;tery enough to exerci&s;e Faith, and Inducements &s;ufficient to influence Action.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<Q>Several other Thoughts occurred to me upon this Subject, but I think I have hinted them in former Letters.</Q>

<HEAD>LETTER CCCXX.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE, ever &s;ince the Clo&s;e of my late nice and extraordinary Subject, been examining and viewing it in &s;everal Lights, to find out whether my Rea&s;oning had proceeded from the Prejudice of former Opinions, or had ari&s;en from an Hope produced by a Sinner's Fear. But I found, that, during a con&s;tant Neglect of religious and Chri&s;tian Duties, and a free Indulgence of a debauched and libertine Life,
<PB N="344" REF="345">
I pre&s;erved an unhe&s;itating Belief in the Ortho|doxy of Hell-Torments; and that, 'till within the&s;e few Years, that is, &s;ince I became in Practice, as well as Belief, a Chri&s;tian, I never had the lea&s;t Doubt upon the Subject. The Truth is, that I had never before given my&s;elf Lei&s;ure to rea&s;on about Religion, and had en|tirely re&s;ted upon a childi&s;h Belief, in&s;tead of &s;upporting my&s;elf by a rational Faith. Perhaps a Di&s;pute upon this Subject may be put an End to by a very &s;trong, though not obvious, Di&s;tinction between <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;ery</HI>; and I will agree with the Orthodoxy, that Sinners may be eternally puni&s;hed, though not eternally mi&s;erable. A le&s;s Degree of Bli&s;s, than we are taught from Rea&s;on and Revelation our Souls are capable of, is a Puni&s;hment, but not a Mi&s;ery; and, after having &s;uffered &s;uch Pains and Torment, emblematized by the <HI>purging &s;o as by Fire,</HI> as is &s;ufficient to fulfil the Mea&s;ure of divine Ju&s;tice, &s;ome inferior Degree of immortal Bli&s;s may be the highe&s;t Portion of a Sinner's Redemption; the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of which Limi|tation having proceeded from his own Vices, or Demerits, may be that Puni&s;hment, which is de&s;cribed in Scripture by the Metaphor of <HI>the Worm that never dieth.</HI></P>
<P>As I have, thro' the Cour&s;e of this Argument, made u&s;e merely of human Rea&s;on, in&s;tead of
<PB N="345" REF="346">
&s;criptural Authority, I &s;hall here call in Aid &s;ome profane Writing to &s;upport me. <HI>Socrates</HI> &s;peaks by <HI>Plato</HI> in his <HI>Gorgias</HI> much to this &s;ame Purpo&s;e; and again in his <HI>Phaedo,</HI> where he is di&s;cour&s;ing ju&s;t before his Death. I have not the Book here, or I would &s;end you the Quotations.</P>
<P>Now I can hardly &s;uffer this to pa&s;s for pro|fane Authority; for he was not only the greate&s;t Heathen that ever lived, but was &s;tiled, by &s;ome of the Fathers of the Church, a Chri&s;tian before Chri&s;tianity; and <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> &s;eems to con&s;ider him as an in&s;pired Per&s;on. Perhaps, the Fulne&s;s of Time being then near at Hand, and the World, as it were, entient with the God of Life and Immortality, &s;ome Ray of Divinity might have illumined that great Man, as the Sun di&s;per&s;es a Twilight, before it&s;elf appears.</P>
<P>It was at this remarkable Aera, when moral Philo&s;ophy was brought to the highe&s;t Pitch that ever it arrived at, in the Heathen World, that <HI>Socrates,</HI> or <HI>Plato</HI> for him, acknowledged the In&s;ufficiency of natural Rea&s;on to perfect this great Scheme, and called aloud for a Revelation to di&s;pel the Mi&s;ts of Error, and afford us a certain, infallible, and &s;afe Guide to direct Mankind in the Paths of Virtue.</P>
<P>If I have erred in my Rea&s;onings upon this Subject, it has been owing more to the Weak|ne&s;s
<PB N="346" REF="347">
of my Under&s;tanding, than the Wickedne&s;s of my Heart. So I &s;hall conclude here with the two la&s;t Lines of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s Epitaph, the whole of which I once tran&s;lated for you:
<Q><L>Humanum e&s;t errare, et ne&s;cire:</L>
<L>Ens Entium, mi&s;erere mei!</L></Q></P>
