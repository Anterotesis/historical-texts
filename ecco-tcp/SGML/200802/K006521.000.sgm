<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>EVER &s;ince my fir&s;t Pulication, the Curio&s;ity, not to &s;ay Anxiety, of the World concerning my Name, has been &s;o great, that it has frequently given me Pain to conceal what the World will now &s;ee it was not po&s;&s;ibly in my Power to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I had no Name, till the Royal Favour lately re&s;tored my very antient and honourable Clan to its pri&s;tine Title and Honours. I was therefore in the &s;ame deplorable Ca&s;e with a certain namele&s;s Lady, whom I have long had the Honour to call my Neigh|bour, and who, I &s;incerely hope, will &s;oon, by the &s;ame Favour, be re&s;tored to that Title, which, upon my Ho|nour, I believe, &s;he has erroneou&s;ly, and not inten|tionally forfeited.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that now, when the Public is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my real Name, it will not, I hope, &s;uf|fer any national Prejudice to prevent it from receiving
<PB N="4" REF="3">
this my fir&s;t Lyrical Attempt with its former Candour. But I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that if this Ode does not &s;ell as well as Mr. CUMBERLAND'S, I &s;hall be apt to impute it, not to any inferiority of Lyrical Ordonance, but merely to its having been written by a Scotchman.</P>
