<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE kind Reception which the la&s;t Edition of this Work has met with, determined the Pro|prietors to &s;pare no Expence to make the pre&s;ent as com|plete as the Nature of the Work would admit; and the Editor, in pur&s;uance of their Intention, has (be&s;ides his own Ob|&s;ervations and Experience) been favour'd with &s;uch ample Materials by &s;everal curious Gentlemen, as have made it impo&s;&s;ible to comprize the Whole in Three Volumes, as before; altho' he omitted all that could be &s;pared, and ab&s;tracted whatever would bear it. He was therefore obliged to add a Fourth Volume.</P>
<P>And this he found him&s;elf under the greater Nece&s;&s;ity of doing; becau&s;e, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n he came to compare the former Edition with
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
his own Notes and the Maps, he di&s;covered many very material Omi&s;&s;ions; particularly that the whole County of <HI>Hertford</HI> was omitted, excepting <HI>St. Albans,</HI> and one or two Villages, as al&s;o the I&s;les of <HI>Wight, Portland, Guern&s;ey, Jer&s;ey, Alderney,</HI> and <HI>Sarke</HI>; together with that of <HI>Man,</HI> and the <HI>Scots I&s;les:</HI> That the De&s;cription of the Northern Counties of <HI>England,</HI> which abound with great Numbers of Re|markables, was al&s;o very defective: and, That the fir&s;t Author had directed his <HI>Tour</HI> in &s;everal Places in &s;uch a manner, as to pa&s;s wholly by &s;everal of the be&s;t Towns, and mo&s;t remarkable Places, and quite out of any Geographical Cour&s;e or Order.</P>
<P>Then the Materials which the Editor was &s;upplied with for <HI>Scotland,</HI> he found would &s;well that Part of the United King|dom to one intire Volume; which before made not half a one; and he was glad of the Opportunity of doing &s;ome further Ju&s;tice to that Country, which has generally been &s;lightly con&s;idered by tho&s;e who know little of it.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that the fir&s;t Author had, in many Places, di&s;claimed Antiquities, as a Subject out of his Province: Whereas we have thought
<PB N="v" REF="4">
our&s;elves obliged, &s;o far as our Limits would permit, to take Notice of &s;uch, as (&s;till remaining) may be con&s;idered as a Part of the Pre&s;ent State of the Counties and Places where, at this Day, they conti|nue vi&s;ible; and which may, moreover, merit the Attention of a curious Traveller; and particularly of &s;uch Antiquities as have been brought to Light &s;ince the la&s;t Edition of <HI>Camden</HI>'s <HI>Britannia.</HI></P>
<P>For the above Rea&s;on, we have been pretty ample in our Accounts of the famous <HI>Stonehenge,</HI> and the Barrows in <HI>Wilts</HI>; and confe&s;s our Obligations on this Head, to the Learned Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> in his late Work on that Subject, to whom we are al&s;o beholden in &s;everal other Places.</P>
<P>We have likewi&s;e thought our&s;elves obliged to take Notice of the Benefits which &s;everal Port and Trading Towns in this Kingdom, as well in its Northern as Sou|thern Parts, have of late Years received from Acts of Parliament for inlarging and re&s;toring of Piers and Harbours, Repairs of Roads, and for making Rivers navigable, where the Face of Affairs in their parti|cular Neighbourhoods have been any way altered or effected by tho&s;e laudable Works.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">We have, moreover, &s;ubjoined to this Edition, Li&s;ts of the Cities and Boroughs which return Members to the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; the Li&s;ts of &s;uch Gen|tlemens Seats in each County, as we had not room to de&s;cribe; likewi&s;e a brief Account of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hopricks, and Li&s;ts of the Peers of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> in &s;uch a manner as will not be &s;ubject to any other Variations than that of the total Extinction of Families; for our Intention was to carry this Piece, as much as the Nature of the Work would admit, beyond the Reach of temporary Fluctuations and Changes.</P>
<P>By what we have &s;aid, it will appear, that this will have the Face of a new Work, and indeed more than the <HI>Face,</HI> as will be &s;een by any who will take the Pains to compare the different Editions; and that therefore it was impo&s;&s;ible to print by them&s;elves, for the U&s;e of the Purcha&s;ers of the la&s;t Edition, tho&s;e new Ob&s;erva|tions, De&s;criptions and Corrections which are incorporated in the pre&s;ent; as the Proprietors were very de&s;irous to have done, had it been practicable. But this we may venture to promi&s;e, that tho' the Nature of this Work is &s;uch, that there mu&s;t be always Room for Additions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
as new Di&s;coveries may be made, or Alter|ations happen by Time; yet, that all &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Alterations and Additions &s;hall, for the future, be printed by them&s;elves, (after the manner of the <HI>Appendix</HI> to VOL. III. of this Edition) that the Rea|der may not be under the Nece&s;&s;ity of re|purcha&s;ing the whole Work.</P>
<P>But le&s;t it &s;hould be imagined, from any thing we have &s;aid above, that we have been &s;o ungenerous, as to endeavour to rai&s;e a Merit to the pre&s;ent Edition, at the Expence of the former, we &s;hall ob&s;erve, That the good Reception which the La|bours of the Original Author met with in his fir&s;t Edition, (and which al&s;o attended the &s;econd, which was printed with very great Additions and Improvements) is no bad Argument of the Value of his Performance. And indeed <HI>He</HI> well de&s;erved that Succe&s;s, who could with Ju&s;tice give &s;uch an Ac|count of his Abilities for the Undertaking, as is contained in the following Paragraphs.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'The Preparations for this Work, &s;ays he, have been &s;uitable to the Author's earne&s;t Concern for its U&s;efulne&s;s. Se|venteen very large Circuits, or Journeys, have been taken thro' divers Parts &s;epa|rately, and Three general Tours over
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
almo&s;t the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Part of the I&s;land; in all which the Author has not been wanting to trea&s;ure up ju&s;t Remarks upon particular Places and Things; &s;o that he is very little in Debt to other Mens Labours, and gives but very few Accounts of Things but what he has been an Eye-witne&s;s of him&s;elf.</P><P>'Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;everal Journeys in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> he has al&s;o lived &s;ome time in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and has travelled critically over great Part of it: He has viewed the North Part of <HI>England,</HI> and the South Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Five &s;everal times over. All which is hinted here, to let the Readers know, what Rea&s;on they have to be &s;atisfy'd with the Authority of the Relation; and that the Accounts here given are not the Produce of a cur&s;ory View, or rai&s;ed upon the borrow'd Lights of other Ob&s;ervers.'</P></Q></P>
<P>We &s;hall only add, That if the Fir&s;t Edition had all the&s;e Advantages, we may very &s;afely &s;ubmit the Merit of the pre&s;ent to the Judgment of the candid Reader.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. A <HI>DESCRIPTION</HI> of Part of the County of <HI>ESSEX,</HI> and of the County of <HI>SUF|FOLK,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I SET out from <HI>London</HI> on my fir&s;t Journey, Ea&s;tward; and took a <HI>Cir|cuit</HI> down by the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Thames</HI> thro' the Mar&s;hes or Hundreds, on the South &s;ide of the County of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> to <HI>Malden, Colche&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Harwich,</HI> thence continuing on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Suffolk</HI> to <HI>Yar|mouth</HI>; thence round by the Edge of the Sea, on the North and We&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> to <HI>Lynn, Wi&s;bich,</HI> and the <HI>Wa&s;h</HI>; thence back again on the
<PB N="2" REF="9">
North-&s;ide of <HI>Suffolk</HI>; thence into the County of <HI>Cambridge</HI>; and &s;o to the We&s;t-part of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> end|ing it in <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> near the Place where I began: re&s;erving the Middle or Centre of the &s;everal Coun|ties to &s;ome little Excur&s;ions, which I made by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing <HI>Bow-Bridge,</HI> where the County of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> begins, I came fir&s;t to the Village of <HI>Stratford,</HI> which is greatly increa&s;ed of late Years in Hou&s;es and Inhabitants, every Vacancy being filled up, in a manner, with the Addition of two little new-built Hamlets, <HI>as they may be called,</HI> on the Fore&s;t-&s;ide of the Town; namely, <HI>Maryland-Point,</HI> and the <HI>Gravel-Pits,</HI> one facing the Road to <HI>Woodford</HI> and <HI>Epping,</HI> and the other that to <HI>Ilford.</HI> As for the Hither-part, it is almo&s;t joined to <HI>Bow,</HI> in &s;pite of Rivers, Canals, Mar&s;hy-grounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Increa&s;e of Buildings may be &s;een proportionally in the other Villages adjacent, e&s;pe|cially on the Fore&s;t-&s;ide; as at <HI>Low-Layton, Lay|ton-&s;tone, Waltham&s;tow, Woodford, Wan&s;ted,</HI> and the Towns of <HI>We&s;t-Ham, Plai&s;tow, Upton,</HI> &amp;c. and this, generally &s;peaking, of hand&s;ome large Hou&s;es, from 20<HI>l.</HI> to 50<HI>l.</HI> a Year; being chiefly the Habitations of the riche&s;t Citizens, &s;uch as are able to keep a Country, as well as a Town Hou&s;e, or &s;uch as have left off Trade altogether. This is &s;o apparent, that they tell me, there are no le&s;s than Two hundred Coaches kept by the Inhabitants within the Circumference of the few Villages named above, be&s;ides &s;uch as are kept by accidental Lodgers: the Cau&s;e of which I &s;hall inlarge upon, when I come to &s;peak of the like in the Counties of <HI>Middle&s;ex, Surrey,</HI> &amp;c. where there will be &s;till more Occa&s;ion to take notice of it.</P>
<P>There have been di&s;cerned within the&s;e few Years, in the Bottom of <HI>Hackney-Mar&s;h,</HI> between <HI>Old-ford</HI> and the <HI>Wyck,</HI> the Remains of a great Stone Cau&s;e|way,
<PB N="3" REF="10">
which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the High|way, or great Road, from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> in&s;tead of that which now leads over the Bridge between <HI>Bow</HI> and <HI>Stratford.</HI></P>
<P>That the great Road lay this Way, and that the great Cau&s;eway continu'd ju&s;t over the River, where now the <HI>Temple-Mills</HI> &s;tand, and pa&s;&s;ed by Sir <HI>Henry Hickes</HI>'s Hou&s;e at <HI>Ruckholls,</HI> is not at all doubted; and that it was one of tho&s;e famous Highways made by the <HI>Romans,</HI> there is undeniable Proof, by the &s;everal Marks of <HI>Roman</HI> Work, and by <HI>Roman</HI> Coins, and other Antiquities found there, &s;ome of which were collected by the late Reverend Mr. <HI>Strype,</HI> Vicar of <HI>Low-Layton.</HI></P>
<P>From hence the great Road pa&s;&s;ed up to <HI>Layton|&s;tone,</HI> a Place by &s;ome known now as much by the Sign of the <HI>Green-Man,</HI> formerly a Lodge upon the Edge of the Fore&s;t; and cro&s;&s;ing by <HI>Wan&s;ted-hou&s;e,</HI> the noble Seat of Earl <HI>Tilney,</HI> (of which hereafter) went over the &s;ame River, which we now cro&s;s at <HI>Ilford</HI>; and pa&s;&s;ing that Part of the great Fore&s;t, called <HI>Henault-Fore&s;t,</HI> came into the pre|&s;ent great Road, a little on this &s;ide the <HI>Whalebone,</HI> a Place &s;o called becau&s;e a Rib-bone of a large Whale, taken in the River of <HI>Thames</HI> the Year that <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> died, 1658. was fixed there.</P>
<P>According to my fir&s;t Intention, of effectually viewing the Sea-coa&s;ts of <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk,</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> I went from <HI>Stratford</HI> to <HI>Barking,</HI> a large Market-town, but chiefly inhabited by Fi&s;hermen, who&s;e Smacks ride in the <HI>Thames,</HI> at the Mouth of <HI>Bark|ing</HI> Creek; from whence their Fi&s;h are &s;ent up to <HI>London,</HI> to the Market at <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> in &s;mall Boats.</P>
<P>The&s;e Fi&s;hing-Smacks are very u&s;eful Ve&s;&s;els to the Publick upon many Occa&s;ions; as particularly in time of War they are u&s;ed as Pre&s;s-&s;macks, run|ning to all the Northern and We&s;tern Coa&s;ts to pick
<PB N="4" REF="11">
up Seamen to man the Navy, when any Expedition is at hand, that requires a &s;udden Equipment. At other times, being excellent Sailors, they are Ten|ders to particular Men of War; and on an Expe|dition, they have been made u&s;e of as Machines, for the blowing up fortified Ports; as formerly at <HI>St. Malo,</HI> and other Places.</P>
<P>The Pari&s;h of <HI>Barking</HI> is very large; and by the Improvement of Lands recovered out of the <HI>Thames,</HI> and out of the River which runs by the Town, the great and &s;mall Tithes, as the Town&s;men a&s;&s;ured me, are worth above 600<HI>l. per Annum.</HI> This Pari&s;h has two Chapels of Ea&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> one at <HI>Ilford,</HI> and one on the &s;ide of the Fore&s;t, called <HI>New-chapel.</HI></P>
<P>A little beyond the Town, on the Road to <HI>Da|genham,</HI> &s;tood a great old Hou&s;e, where, Tradition &s;ays, the <HI>Gunpowder-Trea&s;on</HI> was contrived, and where all the fir&s;t Con&s;ultations about it were held.</P>
<P>This Side of the County is rather rich from the Nature of its Land, than from the Number of its Inhabitants, which is occa&s;ioned by the Unhealthi|ne&s;s of the Air; for the&s;e low Mar&s;h Grounds, which, with all the South-&s;ide of the County, have been gained, as it were, out of the River <HI>Thames,</HI> and the Sea, where the River is wide enough to be called &s;o, begin here, or rather at <HI>We&s;t-Ham,</HI> by <HI>Stratford,</HI> and extend them&s;elves from hence Ea&s;t|ward; growing wider, till we come beyond <HI>Til|bury,</HI> when the flat Country lies &s;ix, &s;even, or eight Miles in Breadth, and is both unhealthy and un|plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>However, it is very good Farming in the Mar&s;hes, becau&s;e the Landlords let good Peny-worths, tho' the Land is rich; for it being a Place where every body cannot live, tho&s;e that venture it, will have Encouragement; and it is but rea&s;onable they &s;hould.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="12">In pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>Barking</HI> to <HI>Dagenham,</HI> we &s;aw the Place where was the famous Breach, that laid near 5000 Acres of Land under Water; but which, after near ten Years Inundation, and the Works being &s;everal times blown up, was at la&s;t effectually &s;topped by Captain <HI>Perry,</HI> who for &s;everal Years had been employed in the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>'s Works, at <HI>Veronitza,</HI> on the River <HI>Don.</HI></P>
<P>Great Part of the Lands in the&s;e Levels, e&s;pecially tho&s;e on this &s;ide <HI>Ea&s;t-Tilbury,</HI> are held by the Farmers, Cow-keepers, and Gra&s;ing-butchers, who live in and near <HI>London,</HI> who generally &s;tock them with <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire</HI> Wethers, (which they buy in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> in <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> when the Gra&s;iers &s;ell off their Stocks) and feed here till <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> or <HI>Candlemas</HI>; and tho' they are not made much the fatter here, than when bought in, yet very good Advantage accrues by the Differ|ence of the Price of Mutton between <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> when cheape&s;t, and <HI>Candlemas,</HI> when deare&s;t; and this is what the Butchers call, by way of Excellence, <HI>right Mar&s;h Mutton.</HI></P>
<P>At the End of the&s;e Mar&s;hes, clo&s;e to the Edge of the River, &s;tands <HI>Tilbury-fort,</HI> which may ju&s;tly be looked upon as the Key of the City of <HI>London:</HI> It is a regular Fortification, the De&s;ign of it was a a Pentagon, but the Water-ba&s;tion, as it would have been called, was never built; the Plan was laid out by Sir <HI>Martin Beckman,</HI> chief Engineer to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. who al&s;o de&s;igned the Works at <HI>Sheerne&s;s.</HI> The E&s;planade of the Fort is very large, and the Ba&s;tions the large&s;t of any in <HI>England.</HI> The Foundation is laid upon Piles driven down two an end of one another, &s;o far, till they were a&s;&s;ured they were below the Chanel of the River, and that the Piles, which were pointed with Iron, entered into the &s;olid Chalk-rock adjoining to the Chalk-hills on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="13">The Works to the Land-&s;ide are complete; the Ba&s;tions are faced with Brick. There is a double Ditch, or Moat, the innermo&s;t of which is 180 Feet broad; a good Counter&s;carp, and a Covered Way marked out, with Ravelins and Tenailles; but they have not been completed.</P>
<P>On the Land-&s;ide there are al&s;o two &s;mall Re|doubts of Brick, but the chief Strength of this Fort on the Land-&s;ide con&s;i&s;ts in being able to lay the whole Level under Water, and &s;o to make it im|po&s;&s;ible for an Enemy to carry on Approaches that way.</P>
<P>On the Side next the River, is a very &s;trong Cur|tain, with a noble Gate called the <HI>Water-gate</HI> in the Middle, and the Ditch is pali&s;ado'd. At the Place where the Water-ba&s;tion was de&s;igned to be built, and which by the Plan &s;hould run wholly out into the River, &s;o to flank the two Curtains, on each &s;ide, &s;tands a high Tower, which they tell us was built in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, and was called the <HI>Block-hou&s;e</HI>; the Side next the Water is vacant.</P>
<P>Before this Curtain, above and below the &s;aid Va|cancy, is a Platform in the place of a Counter&s;carp, on which are planted 106 Cannon, generally carry|ing from 24 to 46 Pound Ball; a Battery &s;o terrible, as well imports the Con&s;equence of that Place: be|&s;ides which, there are &s;maller Pieces planted between, and the Ba&s;tions and Curtain al&s;o are planted with Guns; &s;o that they mu&s;t be bold Fellows who will venture in the bigge&s;t Ships to pa&s;s &s;uch a Battery, if the Men appointed to &s;erve the Guns, do their Duty, as becomes them.</P>
<P>From hence there is nothing for many Miles together remarkable, but a continued Level of un|healthy Mar&s;hes, called <HI>The three Hundreds,</HI> till we come before <HI>Leigh,</HI> and to the Mouth of the Rivers <HI>Chelmer</HI> and <HI>Black-water,</HI> &s;aving that the Towns of <HI>Horndon, Rayley</HI> and <HI>Rochford,</HI> lie near
<PB N="7" REF="14">
the Sea-coa&s;t, extending in the order I have named; but are of no Note. The above Rivers, united, make a large Firth, or Inlet of the Sea, which our Fi&s;hermen and Seamen, who u&s;e it as a Port, call <HI>Malden-water.</HI></P>
<P>In this Inlet is <HI>O&s;ey</HI> or <HI>O&s;yth</HI> I&s;land, &s;o well known by our <HI>London</HI> Men of Plea&s;ure, for producing &s;uch va&s;t Numbers of Wild-Ducks, Mallards, Teals and Wigeons, that the I&s;land &s;eems covered with them, at certain Times of the Year, and they go from <HI>Lon|don</HI> for the Plea&s;ure of Shooting; and often come home very well loaden with Game; and &s;ometimes too with an <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Ague on their Backs, which they find a heavier Load than the Fowls they have &s;hot.</P>
<P>On the Shore, beginning a little below <HI>Candy I&s;land,</HI> or <HI>Leigh Road,</HI> lies a great Shoal or Sand, called the <HI>Black Tayl,</HI> which runs out near three Leagues into the Sea due Ea&s;t; at the End of it &s;tands a Pole or Ma&s;t, &s;et up by the <HI>Trinity-hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> as a Sea-mark: this is called <HI>Shoe-beacon,</HI> from the Point of Land, where this Sand begins, which is called <HI>Shoeberry-ne&s;s,</HI> from a Town of that Name, which &s;tands by it. From this Sand, and on the Edge of <HI>Shoeberry,</HI> before it, or South-we&s;t of it, all along, to the Mouth of <HI>Colche&s;ter-water,</HI> the Shore is full of Shoals and Sands, with &s;ome deep Chanels between; all which are &s;o full of Fi&s;h, that the <HI>Barking</HI> Smacks are well employed here, and the Shore &s;warms, be&s;ides, with &s;mall Fi&s;her-boats, belonging to the Villages and Towns on the Coa&s;t, which come in every Tide with what they take: and &s;elling the &s;maller Fi&s;h in the Country, &s;end the be&s;t and large&s;t upon Hor&s;es, which travel Night and Day to <HI>London</HI> Market.</P>
<P>On this Shore al&s;o are taken the be&s;t and mo&s;t reli&s;hing, tho' not the large&s;t, Oy&s;ters in <HI>England:</HI> The Spot from whence they have their Appellation is a little Bank called <HI>Woelfleet,</HI> in the Mouth of the
<PB N="8" REF="15">
River <HI>Crouch,</HI> called <HI>Crook&s;ea-water</HI>; but the chief Place where the&s;e Oy&s;ters are now had, is from <HI>Wyvenhoe,</HI> and the Shores adjacent, whither they are brought by the Fi&s;hermen, who take them at the Mouth of <HI>Colche&s;ter-water,</HI> and about the Sand they call the <HI>Spits,</HI> and carry them up to <HI>Wyvenhoe,</HI> where they are laid in Beds or Pits on the Shore to feed, as they call it; and then being barrelled up, and carried to <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> which is but three Miles off, they are &s;ent to <HI>London</HI> by Land, and are from thence called <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> Oy&s;ters.</P>
<P>They take al&s;o here fine Soals, which generally yield a good Price at <HI>London</HI> Market: al&s;o &s;ome|times middling Turbut, with Whitings, Codling, and large Flounders.</P>
<P>In the &s;everal Creeks and Openings, on this Shore, are al&s;o other I&s;lands, but of no great Note, except <HI>Mer&s;ey,</HI> which lies between the two Openings of <HI>Malden-water</HI> and <HI>Colche&s;ter-water</HI>; and is a Place of &s;uch difficult Acce&s;s, that 'tis thought a thou&s;and Men might keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it again&s;t a great Force, whether by Land or Sea. On this account, and becau&s;e if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an Enemy, it would &s;hut up all the Navigation and Fi&s;hery on that Side, a Fort was built on the South-ea&s;t Point of it; and gene|rally, in a <HI>Dutch</HI> War, a &s;trong Gari&s;on is kept there to defend it.</P>
<P>At this Place may be &s;aid to end, what we call the <HI>Three Hundreds</HI> of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> which include the mar&s;hy Country, <HI>viz. Bar&s;table</HI> Hundred, <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> Hundred, and <HI>Dengy</HI> Hundred.</P>
<P>One thing de&s;erves mention here; which is, That all along this County it is very frequent to meet with Men that have had from Five or Six, to Fourteen or Fifteen Wives; and I was informed, that in the Mar&s;hes, over-again&s;t <HI>Candy I&s;land,</HI> was a Farmer, who was then living with the five-and-twentieth; and that his Son, who was but Thirty-five
<PB N="9" REF="16">
Years old, had already had about Fourteen. In|deed, this Part of the Story I only had by Report, tho' from good Hands: but the other is well known, and will be atte&s;ted, about <HI>Fobbing, Curringham, Thunder&s;ly, Benfleet, Prittlewell, Wakering, Great Stambridge, Crick&s;ea, Burnham, Dengy,</HI> and other Towns of the like Situation: the Rea&s;on, as a merry Fellow told me, who &s;aid he had had about a Dozen, was this, That they being bred in the Mar&s;hes them&s;elves, and &s;ea&s;oned to the Place, did pretty well; but that they generally cho&s;e to leave their own La&s;&s;es to their Neighbours out of the Mar&s;hes, and went into the Uplands for a Wife: That when they took the young Women out of the whol&s;ome fre&s;h Air, they were clear and healthy; but when they came into the Mar&s;hes among the Fogs and Damps, they pre&s;ently changed Complexion, got an Ague or two, and &s;eldom held it above half a Year, or a Year at mo&s;t: And then, &s;aid he, we go to the Uplands again, and fetch another. So that marrying of Wives was reckoned a kind of good Farm to them. Nor do the Men in the&s;e Parts hold it out, as in other Countries; for we &s;eldom meet with very ancient People among the Poor; in&s;omuch, that hardly one half of the In|habitants are Natives of the Place; but &s;uch as come from other Parts for the Advantage of good Farms.</P>
<P>From the Mar&s;hes and low Grounds, being not able to travel without many Windings and Inden|tures, by rea&s;on of the Creeks and Waters, I came up to the antient Town of <HI>Malden,</HI> &s;ituate at the Conflux of two principal Rivers, the <HI>Chelmer</HI> and the <HI>Black-water,</HI> where they enter into the Sea. It is built in the Form of a Cro&s;s, is a Liberty in it&s;elf, and has a convenient Haven for Ships; it con&s;i&s;ts of one Street near a Mile long, be&s;ides Lanes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is governed by Two Bailiffs, Aldermen, Steward, Re|corder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here is a good publick Library, for
<PB N="10" REF="17">
the U&s;e of the Mini&s;ter and the Clergy of the Hun|dreds adjoining to the Sea, and any Gentleman may borrow a Book, upon depo&s;iting the Value of it.</P>
<P>The Chanel called <HI>Malden-water</HI> is navigable to the Town; where, by that means, is a great Trade for carrying Corn by Water to <HI>London</HI>; the Coun|ty of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> being (e&s;pecially on that Side) a great Corn Country. King <HI>Edward the Elder</HI> re&s;ided here whil&s;t he built the Town and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Witham</HI> in this County, and al&s;o <HI>Hertford</HI> Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><HI>Malden</HI> was a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony, which <HI>Camden</HI> diffidently conjectures to be the antient <HI>Camalodunum.</HI> But Mr. <HI>Salmon</HI> will have it to be the <HI>Villa Fau&s;tini,</HI> which has been &s;o long attributed to <HI>St. Edmund's-bury:</HI> but however that be, it was here the <HI>Bri|tons,</HI> under the valiant Queen <HI>Boadicea,</HI> cut in Pieces the tenth Legion, killed above 80,000 <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> and de&s;troyed the Colony; but &s;he was after|wards overthrown her&s;elf in a great Battle, 60,000 <HI>Britons</HI> &s;lain, and her&s;elf and Daughters mo&s;t in|humanly treated and di&s;graced, by tho&s;e great Re|formers of the World, who, in her Ca&s;e, forgot not only the Honour due to the Sex, but that which the truly Brave &s;hew to the Brave in Misfortune.</P>
<P>Being obliged to come thus far into the Uplands, I made it my Road to pa&s;s thro' <HI>Witham,</HI> built, as I mentioned, by <HI>Edward the Elder.</HI> 'Tis a plea&s;ant, well-&s;ituated Market-town, in which, and in its Neighbourhood, are many Gentlemen of good For|tunes and Families.</P>
<P>Nearer <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> hard by <HI>Boreham,</HI> is the fa|mous Seat of <HI>Beaulieu,</HI> in which King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. very much delighted. It is the large&s;t Edifice in the County next <HI>Audley-end,</HI> where lived the late Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Barrington,</HI> who had the Advantage to be twice made Heir to the E&s;tates of Gentlemen not at all related to him, at lea&s;t one of them, as is mentioned in his Patent of Creation. He changed
<PB N="11" REF="18">
the Name of <HI>Shute</HI> for that of <HI>Barrington,</HI> by an Act of Parliament, and had the Dignities of a Baron and Vi&s;count of <HI>Ireland</HI> conferred on him by K. <HI>Geo.</HI> I.</P>
<P>The Product of all this Part of the Country is Corn, as that of the mar&s;hy feeding Grounds is Gra&s;s, where their chief Bu&s;ine&s;s is breeding of Calves, which I need not &s;ay are the be&s;t and fatte&s;t, and the large&s;t Veal in <HI>England,</HI> if not in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Kelvedon,</HI> or, as it is commonly called, <HI>Keldon,</HI> lies within three Miles of <HI>Witham</HI>; which, as it is &s;aid, derives its Name from <HI>Kill-Dane,</HI> the Ma&s;&s;acre of the <HI>Danes</HI> being begun here by the Women; but as neither Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> nor any Author of Credit mentions it, I think the Story is not to be heeded.</P>
<P><HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>Iciani</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> according to Mr. <HI>Salmon,</HI> is plea&s;antly &s;ituated upon an Emi|nence above the River <HI>Coln.</HI> It is a large and populous Town, adorned with hand&s;ome Streets, and, tho' it cannot be &s;aid to be finely built, yet there are abundance of good Hou&s;es in it. In the Conclu&s;ion of the late Civil War it &s;uffered a &s;evere Siege; which, as it made a re&s;olute Defence, was turned into a Blockade, wherein the Gari&s;on, and Inhabitants al&s;o, &s;uffered the utmo&s;t Extremity of Hunger, and were at la&s;t obliged to &s;urrender at Di&s;cretion; when their two chief Officers, Sir <HI>Charles Lucas,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Li&s;le,</HI> were &s;hot to Death under the Ca&s;tle-wall.</P>
<P>The battered Walls, the Breaches in the Turrets, and the ruined Churches, &s;till &s;hew Marks of this Siege, except that the Church of <HI>St. Mary</HI> (where they had the Royal Fort) is rebuilt; but the Steeple, which was Two-thirds battered down, (the Be&s;ieged having a large Culverin upon it, which did much Execution) remains &s;till in that Condition.</P>
<P>The Lines of Contravallation, which &s;urrounded the whole Town, and the Forts of the Be&s;iegers, remain very vi&s;ible in many Places.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="19">The River <HI>Coln,</HI> which pa&s;&s;es through the Town, encompa&s;&s;es it on the North and Ea&s;t; and &s;erved, in Times of War, for a complete Defence on tho&s;e Sides. There are three Bridges over it, and it is navigable within three Miles of the Town, for Ships of large Burden; a little lower it may receive even a Royal Navy: and up to that Part called the <HI>Hithe,</HI> clo&s;e to the Hou&s;es, it is navigable for Hoys and &s;mall Barks; for which it is indebted to three Acts of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, one in the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> III. one in that of King <HI>George</HI> I. and the other in that of King <HI>George</HI> II.</P>
<P>This <HI>Hithe</HI> is a long Street, pa&s;&s;ing from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, on the South-&s;ide of the Town, and is &s;o po|pulous towards the River, that it may be called, <HI>The Wapping of Colche&s;ter.</HI> There is one Church in that Part of the Town, a large Quay by the River, and a good Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Town chiefly &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by the Trade of making Bays, tho' indeed all the Towns around carry on the &s;ame Trade; as <HI>Kelvedon, Witham, Cogg&s;hall, Brain|tree, Bocking,</HI> &amp;c. and the whole County, large as it is, may be &s;aid to be employed, and in Part maintained, by the Spinning of Wool, for the Bay-Trade of <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> and its adjacent Towns.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> has been &s;uppo&s;ed to con|tain about 40,000 People, including the Out-vil|lages within its Liberty, of which there are a great many, the Liberty of the Town being of a large Extent. The Government is by a Mayor, High-Steward, a Recorder or his Deputy, Eleven Alder|men, a Chamberlain, a Town-clerk, A&s;&s;i&s;tants, and Eighteen Common-council-men.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> Eight Churches, be&s;ides tho&s;e which are damaged, and Five Meeting-hou&s;es, whereof two for Quakers; be&s;ides one <HI>Dutch,</HI> and one <HI>French</HI> Church. Its other publick Edifices are,</P>

<P N="5">5. <HI>The Ca&s;tle of Colche&s;ter</HI> is a Monument of the Antiquity of the Place, it being built, as the Walls of the Town al&s;o are, with <HI>Roman</HI> Bricks; and the <HI>Roman</HI> Coins dug up here, and ploughed up in the Fields adjoining, confirm it. The Inhabitants boa&s;t much, that <HI>Helena,</HI> the Mother of <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great,</HI> fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Emperor of the <HI>Romans,</HI> was born there: but it would be hard to make it out; and indeed, were it our Bu&s;ine&s;s, we could produce &s;trong Proofs to the contrary. Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> &s;ays, That this Ca&s;tle was, in his Time, ready to fall with Age; and yet it has &s;tood above 120 Years &s;ince, and perhaps is not much wor&s;e than it was then, altho' it received &s;everal Cannon Shot in the la&s;t Siege of the Town, which made no Impre&s;&s;ion upon it, as the Be&s;iegers found, and therefore left off firing again&s;t it, and the rather, as the Gari&s;on made no great U&s;e of it again&s;t them. The Queen's Head in the Market-place, and the Stable, are al&s;o <HI>Roman</HI> Buildings. There was likewi&s;e a <HI>Roman</HI> Military Way from <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> by <HI>Braintree, Dun|mow,</HI> and farther that Way.</P>
<P>There are two CHARITY-SCHOOLS &s;et up here, and carried on by a generous Sub&s;cription, with very good Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>From <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> I took a Turn down to the Coa&s;t. The Land running out a great way into the Sea, South, and South-ea&s;t, makes that Pro|montory

<P>But as it is pretended by &s;ome, that according to the pre&s;ent U&s;age of the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,</HI> the Port of <HI>London</HI> is not allowed to extend &s;o far; 'tis thought proper to in&s;ert the Clau&s;e taken from the Act of Parliament, e&s;tabli&s;hing the Extent of that Port.</P>

<P>At <HI>Walton,</HI> under the <HI>Na&s;e,</HI> they find on the Shore Copperas-&s;tones in great Quantities; and there are &s;everal large Works called Copperas-hou&s;es, where 'tis made with great Expence.</P>
<P>On the <HI>North-Foreland</HI> is a new Mark, erected by the <HI>Trinity-hou&s;e</HI> Men, at the publick Expence, being a round Brick Tower, near 80 Feet high. The Sea gains &s;o much upon the Land here, by the continual Winds at South-we&s;t, that within the Memory of &s;ome of the Inhabitants, above 30 Acres of Land have been lo&s;t in one Place.</P>
<P>From hence we go back into the County about four Miles, becau&s;e of the Creeks which lie between; and turning Ea&s;t again, come to <HI>Harwich,</HI> on the utmo&s;t Ea&s;tern Point of this large County.</P>
<P><HI>Harwich</HI> is a Town, &s;trong by Situation, and may be made more &s;o by Art. The Harbour or Road is one of the &s;ecure&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> and covered at the Entrance by <HI>Landguard-fort,</HI> and a Bat|tery of Guns to the Seaward, ju&s;t as at <HI>Tilbury,</HI> and which &s;ufficiently defend the Mouth of the River. Tho' the Entrance or Opening of the River into the Sea is very wide, e&s;pecially at High-water, at lea&s;t two Miles, if not three, over; yet the Chanel, in which the Ships mu&s;t keep and come to the Harbour, is deep, narrow, and lies only on the Side of the Fort; &s;o that all the Ships
<PB N="16" REF="23">
which come in, or go out, mu&s;t come within Gun|&s;hot of the Fort.</P>
<P>The Fort is on the <HI>Suffolk</HI> Side of the Bay, but &s;tands &s;o far into the Sea, upon the Point of a Sand or Shoal running out towards the <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Side, that, in a manner, it covers the Mouth of the Haven; and our Surveyors of the Country affirm it to be in the County of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> The making this Place, which was formerly no other than a Sand in the Sea, &s;olid enough for the Foundation of &s;o good a Fortifi|cation, co&s;t many Years Labour, frequent Repairs, and a prodigious Expence; but 'tis now &s;o firm, that neither Storms nor Tides affect it.</P>
<P>The Harbour is of a va&s;t Extent; for the River <HI>Stour</HI> from <HI>Maningtree,</HI> and River <HI>Orwel</HI> from <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> empty them&s;elves here; and the Chanels of both are large and deep, and &s;afe for all Weathers; and where they join, they make a large Bay, or Road, able to receive the bigge&s;t Ships of War, and the greate&s;t Number that ever the World &s;aw to|gether. In the <HI>Dutch</HI> War, great U&s;e was made of this Harbour; and there have been 100 Sail of Men of War with their Attendants, and between 3 and 400 Sail of Colliers, all riding in it at a time, with great Safety and Convenience.</P>
<P><HI>Harwich</HI> is the Port where the Packet-boats be|tween <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> go out and come in: the Inhabitants are far from being famed for good U&s;age to Strangers, but on the contrary, are e&s;teemed a little extravagant in their Reckonings, in the Pub|lick-hou&s;es; this has encouraged the &s;etting up of Sloops, which they now call Pa&s;&s;age-boats, to go directly from the River of <HI>Thames</HI> to <HI>Holland:</HI> tho' the Pa&s;&s;age may be &s;omething longer, yet the Ma&s;ters of the Sloops are &s;aid to be more obliging to Pa&s;&s;engers, and more rea&s;onable in the Expence, and the Ve&s;&s;els good Sea-boats. <HI>Harwich</HI> has been a Sufferer on this Account.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24">The People of <HI>Harwich</HI> boa&s;t, that their Town is walled, and their Streets paved with Clay, and yet that one is as &s;trong, and the other as clean, as tho&s;e that are built or paved with Stone. The Fact is indeed true; for there is a &s;ort of Clay in the Cliff, between the Town and the Beacon-hill adjoining, which, when it falls down into the Sea, where it is beaten with the Waves and the Weather, turns gra|dually into Stone. But the chief Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned is from the Water of a certain Spring or Well, which ri&s;ing in the Cliff, runs down into the Sea among tho&s;e Pieces of Clay, and petrifies them as it runs; and the Force of the Sea often &s;tirring, and perhaps turning the Lumps of Clay, when Storms of Wind may give Force enough to the Water, cau&s;es them to harden every-where alike; otherwi&s;e tho&s;e which were not quite &s;unk in the Water of the Spring, would be petrify'd but in part. The&s;e Stones are gathered up to pave the Streets, and build the Hou&s;es, and are indeed very hard. 'Tis al&s;o remarkable, that &s;ome of them, taken up before they are thoroughly petrify'd, will, upon breaking them, appear to be hard as a Stone without, and &s;oft as Clay in the Middle; whereas others, that have lain a due time, &s;hall be thorough Stone to the Centre, and full as hard within as without. The &s;ame Spring is &s;aid to turn Wood into Iron: but this I take to be no more or le&s;s than the Quality, which (as I mentioned of the Shore at the <HI>Ne&s;s</HI>) is found to be in much of the Stone along this Shore, of the Copperas Kind: and 'tis certain, that the <HI>Copperas-&s;tone</HI> (&s;o called) is found in all that Cliff, and even where the Water of this Spring has run; and I pre&s;ume, that tho&s;e who call the hardened Pieces of Wood, which they take out of this Well, by the Name of Iron, never tried the Quality of it with the Fire or Hammer; if they had, it is not unlikely, that they would have given &s;ome other Account of it.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="25">On the Promontory of Land, which they call <HI>Beacon-hill,</HI> which lies beyond or behind the Town, toward the Sea, is a Light-hou&s;e, to give the Ships Direction in their &s;ailing by, as well as their coming into the Harbour at Night.</P>
<P>This Town was formerly fortify'd; but in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. the Fortifications were demoli&s;hed. It has &s;ince been ordered to be fortify'd again, and Ground has been bought accordingly, to the King's U&s;e, by Act of Parliament: but there is nothing more done in it yet; and indeed it is many Years &s;ince the Government, having a better Secu|rity in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Shipping, have had Occa&s;ion to fortify Towns to the Landward.</P>
<P>It was incorporated in the 13th of <HI>Edward</HI> II. The <HI>Harwich</HI> Men pretended a Grant from <HI>Edw.</HI> III. to take Cu&s;tom-duties for Goods coming into the Haven, till on a Complaint made by the Town of <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> that it was an Infringement upon their Li|berties, an Inqui&s;ition was appointed by that Prince at <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> in the 14th of his Reign, by which it was determined again&s;t <HI>Harwich,</HI> in favour of <HI>Ip&s;wich.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harwich,</HI> after all, may be &s;aid to be a neat, clean, well-built Town, enjoys a good Maritime Trade, is governed by a Mayor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> has a Market every <HI>Tue&s;|day</HI> and <HI>Friday,</HI> and two annual Fairs, one on <HI>May-day,</HI> the other on <HI>October</HI> the 18th.</P>
<P><HI>Landguard-fort</HI> was built in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> I. and was a much more con&s;iderable Forti|fication than at pre&s;ent; having had four Ba&s;tions, named the <HI>King's,</HI> the <HI>Queen's, Holland's,</HI> and <HI>Warwick's,</HI> mounted with 60 very large Guns, par|ticularly tho&s;e on the Royal <HI>Ba&s;tion,</HI> where the King's Standard was di&s;play'd, which would throw a 28 Pound Ball over <HI>Harwich</HI>; and it had a con|&s;tant Gari&s;on, with a Chapel and many Hou&s;es, for the Governor, Gunners, and other Officers. But it has been demoli&s;hed, and a &s;mall Platform made in&s;tead
<PB N="19" REF="26">
of it by the Water-&s;ide; but yet, as the particular Current of the Chanel, which Ships mu&s;t keep in, as I have &s;aid, obliges them to pa&s;s ju&s;t by the Fort, the Harbour is &s;ufficiently defended on the Sea-&s;ide from &s;udden Inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>And now, being at the Extremity of the County of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> of which I have given you &s;ome View, as to that Side next the Sea only; I &s;hall conclude this Part of my Circuit, by telling you, that I will take the Towns which lie more towards the Centre of the County, in my Return by the North and We&s;t Part, that I may give you a few Hints of &s;ome Towns which were near me in my Rout this way.</P>

<P>At the farther End of this Town, in the Middle of a &s;tately Park, &s;tood <HI>Guldy-hall,</HI> vulgarly <HI>Giddy-hall,</HI> an antient Seat of one Sir <HI>Thomas Coke,</HI> Lord-Mayor of <HI>London Anno</HI> 1462. in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. who&s;e great Riches being his principal Crime, expo&s;ed him in bad Times to &s;o great Suf|ferings, that tho' he was acquitted, by the In|tegrity of his Judge, of the Crimes laid to his Charge, yet he was fined to the Value very nearly of his whole E&s;tate. It is &s;ince pulled down to the Ground, and there now &s;tands a &s;tately Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, built upon the Spot by Sir <HI>John Eyles,</HI> lately Lord-Mayor of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brentwood</HI> and <HI>Ingat&s;tone</HI> are two others, and are large thorough-fare Towns, full of good Inns, chiefly maintained by the Multitude of Carriers and
<PB N="20" REF="27">
Pa&s;&s;engers, con&s;tantly pa&s;&s;ing this Way to <HI>London,</HI> with Droves of Cattle, Provi&s;ions and Manufactures.</P>
<P><HI>Chelmsford</HI> is the 4th, chiefly &s;upported by the fame Bu&s;ine&s;s. It is the County-town, where the A&s;&s;izes are often held, and &s;tands on the Conflux of two Rivers, the <HI>Chelmer,</HI> whence the Town derives its Name, and the <HI>Cann</HI>; and has a good Free-&s;chool belonging to it.</P>
<P>South-ea&s;t of <HI>Brentwood</HI> lies <HI>Billiricay,</HI> a pretty con&s;iderable Market-town.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Chelmsford</HI> &s;tands a Seat of the Right Ho|nourable the Earl of <HI>Fitzwalter,</HI> which is &s;een on the Left-hand of the Road, ju&s;t before you enter the Town. The Hou&s;e is large, and hath been lately new fronted, &s;o that it makes a hand&s;ome Appearance. There are al&s;o &s;everal new Planta|tions about it, and in time, if his Lord&s;hip con|tinues his De&s;ign of improving it, it will become a fine Seat.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take notice, in my Return through the&s;e Parts, of the noble Seat of the Lord <HI>Petre,</HI> and his Lord&s;hip's great Improvements in this County.</P>
<P>At <HI>Lees,</HI> or <HI>Lee's-Priory,</HI> as &s;ome call it, is to be &s;een an antient Hou&s;e, in the Middle of a beautiful Park, formerly the Seat of the Duke of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>; but after the Death of the Duke it was &s;old to the Duche&s;s Dowager of <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> and &s;ince purcha&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Hoare.</HI></P>
<P>Five Market-towns fill up the re&s;t of this Part of the Country; <HI>Dunmow, Braintree, Thaxted, Hal|&s;ted,</HI> and <HI>Cogg&s;hall</HI>; all noted for the Manufacture of Bays. But <HI>Dunmow</HI> I mu&s;t particularly mention, on account of its famous old Story of its Flitch of Bacon; which is this:</P>
<P>One <HI>Robert Fitzwalter,</HI> a powerful Baron in this County, in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> III. in&s;tituted a Cu&s;tom in the Priory here; That <HI>whatever married Man did not repent of his being married, or differ and</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="28"><HI>di&s;pute with his Wife within a Year and a Day after his Marriage, and would &s;wear to the Truth of it, kneeling upon two hard pointed Stones in the</HI> Priory Church-yard, <HI>&s;et up for that Purpo&s;e, in Pre&s;ence of the Prior and Convent, &s;uch Per&s;on &s;hould have a Flitch of Bacon.</HI></P>
<P>This has been actually claimed and received, as appears by Record there; but the Priory being di&s;|&s;olved, there is an End of the Flitch; and it were well, if no wor&s;e Con&s;equence had attended the Di&s;|&s;olution of Religious Hou&s;es. For as there was no Danger of many Claimants, there were the fewer to regret the Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Braintree</HI> and <HI>Bocking</HI> I &s;hall take notice in my Return to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Formerly, 'tis thought, the Fore&s;ts of <HI>Epping</HI> and <HI>Henault</HI> took up all the South Part of the County; but particularly we are a&s;&s;ured, that it reached to the River <HI>Chelmer,</HI> and into <HI>Dengy</HI> Hundred; and from thence again We&s;t to <HI>Epping</HI> and <HI>Waltham,</HI> where it continues to be a Fore&s;t &s;till.</P>
<P>Probably that of <HI>Epping</HI> has been a Weald or Fore&s;t ever &s;ince this I&s;land has been inhabited, and may &s;hew us, in &s;ome Parts of it, <HI>where Inclo&s;ures and Tillage have not broke in upon it,</HI> what the general Face of this I&s;land was, before the <HI>Romans</HI> landed in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The Con&s;titution of this Fore&s;t is be&s;t &s;een, as to its Antiquity, by the plea&s;ant Grant of it from <HI>Edward the Confe&s;&s;or,</HI> before the <HI>Norman</HI> Conque&s;t, to <HI>Randolph Peperking,</HI> one of his Favourites, who was after called <HI>Peverell,</HI> and who&s;e Name remains &s;till in &s;everal Villages in this County; as particu|larly that of <HI>Hatfield Peverell,</HI> in the Road from <HI>Chelmsford</HI> to <HI>Witham,</HI> which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be originally a Park (called a Field in tho&s;e Days); and <HI>Hartfield</HI> may be as much as to &s;ay, a Park for Deer; for the Stags were in tho&s;e Days called <HI>Harts</HI>;
<PB N="22" REF="29">
&s;o that this was neither more nor le&s;s than <HI>Randolph Peperking</HI>'s <HI>Hart-field,</HI> or <HI>Deer-park.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Randolph</HI> or <HI>Ralph Peverell</HI> had, it &s;eems, a beautiful Lady to his Wife, who was Daughter of <HI>Ingelrick,</HI> one of <HI>Edward the Confe&s;&s;or</HI>'s Noblemen: He had two Sons by her, <HI>William Peverell,</HI> a famed Soldier, and Lord or Governor of <HI>Dover-ca&s;tle</HI>; which he &s;urrendered to <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> after the Battle in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI>; and <HI>Pain Peverell,</HI> his younge&s;t, who was Lord of <HI>Cambridge.</HI> When the elde&s;t Son delivered up the Ca&s;tle, the Lady above-named was there; and the Conqueror fell in Love with her, and had a Son by her, who was called <HI>William,</HI> after the Conqueror's Chri&s;tian Name, but retained the Name of <HI>Peverell,</HI> and was afterwards, as Hi|&s;tory acquaints us, created by the Conqueror Lord of <HI>Nottingham.</HI></P>
<P>This Lady, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, by way of Penance for her Frailty, founded a Nunnery at the Village of <HI>Hatfield-Peverell,</HI> mentioned above, where &s;he lies buried in the Pari&s;h-church, and her Memory is pre&s;erved by a Tomb&s;tone under one of the Windows. The Grant I have mentioned being to be found in <HI>Camden,</HI> I &s;hall not tran&s;cribe it here.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now, in pur&s;uance of my fir&s;t De&s;ign, pro|ceed to the County of <HI>Suffolk.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Harwich</HI> therefore, having a mind to view the Harbour, I &s;ent my Hor&s;es round by <HI>Maning-tree,</HI> a good, but dirty Market-town, where there is a Timber-bridge over the <HI>Stour,</HI> or, as it is more u&s;ually called, <HI>Maningtree-water</HI>; and took a Boat for <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> up the River <HI>Orwel,</HI> known be&s;t by the Name of <HI>Ip&s;wich-water,</HI> by which Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Har|wich</HI> to <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> it is about twelve Miles.</P>
<P>In a Creek in this River called <HI>Lavington-creek,</HI> we &s;aw at low Water &s;uch Shoals of Mu&s;cles, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> great Boats might have loaded with them and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">

Quantity &s;carce dimini&s;hed to the Eye. Near this Creek Sir <HI>Samuel Barnardi&s;ton</HI> had a fine Seat, as al&s;o a Decoy for wild Ducks, and a very noble E&s;tate; but it is divided into many Branches &s;ince his Death.</P>
<P><HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> is &s;eated at the Di&s;tance of 12 Miles from <HI>Harwich,</HI> upon the Edge of the River, which take|ing a &s;hort Turn to the We&s;t, the Town forms there a kind of Semi-circle, or Half-moon, upon the Bank of the River. It is very remarkable, that tho' Ships of 500 Tuns may upon a Spring-tide come up very near this Town, and many Ships of that Burden have been built there; yet the River is &s;carce navigable above the Town, not even for the &s;malle&s;t Boats; nor does the Tide, which ri&s;es &s;ometimes 13 or 14 Feet, and gives them 24 Feet Water very near the Town, flow much farther up the River than the Town.</P>
<P>No Place in <HI>Britain</HI> is qualified like <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> for carrying on the <HI>Greenland</HI> Fi&s;hery; whether we re|&s;pect the Cheapne&s;s of building and fitting out their Ships and Shalloops; furni&s;hing, victualling, and providing them with all kind of Stores; Conveni|ence for laying up the Ships after the Voyage; Room for erecting their Magazines, Ware-hou&s;es, Roap-walks, Cooperages, <HI>&amp;e.</HI> on the ea&s;ie&s;t Terms; and e&s;pecially for the noi&s;ome Cookery, which attends the boiling their Blubber, which may be on this River, remote from any Places of Re&s;ort: then the Near|ne&s;s to the Market for the Oil, when it is made, and, which above all ought to be regarded, the Conveniency that ari&s;es from this Con&s;ideration, that the &s;ame Wind which carries them from the Mouth of the Haven, is fair to the very Seas of <HI>Greenland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> was formerly much more con&s;iderable for Trade than at pre&s;ent; but yet it may be accounted a very neat and well-built Town, and much larger than many Cities; carries on &s;till a con&s;iderable Ma|ritime
<PB N="24" REF="31">
Trade; and tho' it is but thinly inhabited, to what it has been, yet whoever looks into the Churches and Meeting-hou&s;es of a <HI>Sunday,</HI> will not, even in this Particular, think &s;o meanly of it as &s;ome have done.</P>
<P>It has a very &s;pacious Market-place; in the mid&s;t of that is a fair Cro&s;s, in which is the Corn-market. Adjoining is the Shambles or Butchery, very com|modious, and vulgarly, but erroneou&s;ly, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built by Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI>; for it owes its Original to a much later Date, <HI>viz.</HI> to the 40th Year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> Behind this is the Herb-market, and in a &s;pacious Street a little di&s;tant, is a Market for Butter, Poultry, and other Country Provi&s;ions, and another for Fi&s;h, with which the Town is &s;erved in great Plenty. It has five Market-days weekly; <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> and <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> for &s;mall Meat; <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> and <HI>Friday</HI> for Fi&s;h; and <HI>Saturday</HI> for all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions. It has al&s;o five annual Fairs; one on <HI>April</HI> 23. one on <HI>May</HI> 7. and 8. one on <HI>July</HI> 25. one on the 11th and 12th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> for Cattle al&s;o; and the fifth on <HI>September</HI> 14. which is a very con&s;iderable one for Butter and Chee&s;e, to which the whole Country round re&s;ort, to furni&s;h them&s;elves with Winter Stores; as do al&s;o many of the <HI>London</HI> Dealers in tho&s;e Commodities, who, however, are not &s;uffered to buy till after the fir&s;t three Days of the Fair.</P>
<P>There are even now in this Town 12 Pari&s;h-churches, out of 14, which there once were; and two Chapels in the Corporation-liberty, out of &s;everal which have been demoli&s;hed, be&s;ides Meeting-hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it once abounded with Religious Hou&s;es, which have yielded to the Fate of the Times.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a fair Town-hall, with a &s;pacious Council-chamber, and other commodious Apart|ments; a Shire-hall, where the County Se&s;&s;ions are
<PB N="25" REF="32">
held for the Divi&s;ion of <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI>; a large publick Library, adjoining to a noble Ho&s;pital founded by the Town, called <HI>Chri&s;t's Ho&s;pital,</HI> for the Mainte|nance of Poor Children, old Per&s;ons, Maniacks; and in it Rogues, Vagabonds, and &s;turdy Beggars, are kept to hard Labour. Al&s;o adjoining to this is a good Free-&s;chool; and there is likewi&s;e the noble Foundation of Mr. <HI>Henry Tooly, Anno</HI> 1556, for poor old Men and Women.</P>
<P>It is a Town Corporate, governed by two Bailiffs, a Recorder, 12 Portmen, four of which, be&s;ides the Bailiffs, are Ju&s;tices of the Peace, two Coroners, 24 Common-council-men, who are al&s;o High-con|&s;tables, and 12 of them Headboroughs, and 15 Petty Con&s;tables.</P>
<P>Its Privileges are extraordinary; for the Bailiffs pa&s;s Fines and Recoveries, hear and determine Cau&s;es, as well Criminal as Civil, ari&s;ing in the Town, and even Crown Cau&s;es, preferably to any of his Ma|je&s;ty's Courts at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> They appoint the A&s;&s;ize of Bread, Wine, Beer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> No Freeman can be obliged to &s;erve on Juries out of the Town, or bear any Offices for the King, without his own Con&s;ent, Sheriffs for the County excepted. Nor are they obliged to pay any Tolls or Duties in any other Parts of the Kingdom, having ca&s;t the City of <HI>Lon|don</HI> in a Trial at Law for Duties demanded by the City of Freemens Ships, in the River <HI>Thames.</HI> They are intitled to all Waifs, E&s;trays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to all Goods ca&s;t on Shore within their Admiralty-Juri&s;|diction, which extends on the Coa&s;t of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> be|yond <HI>Harwich,</HI> and on both Sides the <HI>Suffolk</HI> Coa&s;t; and their Bailiffs even hold their Admiralty-court beyond <HI>Landguard</HI> Fort, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And by a &s;olemn Deci&s;ion in their Favour by an Inqui&s;ition taken at <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> in the 14th of <HI>Edward</HI> III. they carried the Point, which <HI>Harwich</HI> conte&s;ted with them, of taking Cu&s;tom-duties for Goods coming into <HI>Har|wich</HI>

Haven, which was determined to belong &s;olely to the Bailiffs and Burge&s;&s;es of <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> as I before hinted. In King <HI>John</HI>'s Reign, there was a Mint in this Town.</P>
<P>I &s;hall ju&s;t mention, in this Place, tho' it be ge|nerally known, that the famous Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> was born in this Town, his Father being a Butcher in it, tho', according to Dr. <HI>Fiddes,</HI> who publi&s;hed his Will, he &s;eems to have been a Man of Sub&s;tance for tho&s;e Times. This Prelate ro&s;e to the highe&s;t Pitch of Honour and Grandeur, that it was po&s;&s;ible for a Subject to attain to, and was &s;uddenly &s;tripped of all, having been ca&s;t in a Praemunire, whereby he incurr'd a Forfeiture of all his Effects and Preferments; and being after|wards pardoned and re&s;tored to &s;ome Part thereof, particularly to the Archbi&s;hoprick of <HI>York,</HI> he was arre&s;ted for High-Trea&s;on at his Archiepi&s;copal Palace at <HI>Cawood</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire</HI>; and died at <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> Abbey, as he was carrying to <HI>London,</HI> where he was buried.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Refugees, when they fir&s;t came over to <HI>England</HI> began a little to take to this Place; and &s;ome Merchants attempted to &s;et up a Linen Ma|nufacture in their Favour; but it did not meet with the expected Succe&s;s, and at pre&s;ent I find very lit|tle of it. The poor People are however employ'd, as they are all over tho&s;e Counties, in &s;pinning Wooll for other Towns where Manufactures are &s;ettled.</P>
<P>The Country round <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> as are all the Coun|ties &s;o near the Coa&s;t, is applied chiefly to Corn, of which a very great Quantity is continually &s;hipped off for <HI>London</HI>; and &s;ometimes they load Corn here for <HI>Holland,</HI> e&s;pecially if the Market abroad is encouraging.</P>
<P>There is a great deal of very good Company in this Town; and tho' here are not &s;o many of the Gentry as at <HI>Bury,</HI> yet it has more than any other Town in the County.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="34">I take this Town to be one of the mo&s;t agreeable Places in <HI>England,</HI> for Families who have lived well, but may be reduced to live within a narrow Com|pa&s;s; for

<P>The Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Hereford</HI> had a very fine Seat and Park in this Town; the Hou&s;e indeed was built in the antient Ta&s;te, but very commodious; 'tis called <HI>Chri&s;t-church,</HI> and had been a Priory, or Re|ligious Hou&s;e, in former Times. The Green and Park is a great Addition to the Plea&s;antne&s;s of this Town, the Inhabitants being allowed to divert them|&s;elves there with Walking, Bowling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Seat has been lately purcha&s;ed by, and is now in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Claude Fonnereau,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></P>
<P>The Country round <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> is an inexhau&s;tible Store-hou&s;e of Timber; of which, now their Trade of building Ships is abated, they &s;end very great Quantities to the King's Building-yards at <HI>Chatham</HI>; which by Water is &s;o little a Way, that they often run to it from the Mouth of the River at <HI>Harwich</HI> in one Tide.</P>
<P>I cannot omit in this Place the following Account of an excellent Charity for the Relief and Support of the Widows and Orphans of poor Clergymen of the County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> which was begun in the Year 1704. by a voluntary Sub&s;cription of a &s;mall Number of Gentlemen and Clergy, in and about <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> and <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> and has &s;ince that Time been carried on with &s;uch great Succe&s;s, that the

yearly Collection, which in 1704. was but 6<HI>l.</HI> by gradual Advances every Year, amounted in the Year 1740. to 312<HI>l.</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> and in the Whole 37 Years to the Sum of 4416<HI>l.</HI> 9<HI>s.</HI> 9<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the yearly Sub&s;criptions, there have been divers Gifts and Legacies given to the &s;aid Society, to the U&s;es above-mentioned, to the Amount of 554<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> So much of which is laid out in <HI>South-Sea</HI> Annuities, and kept for rai&s;ing a capital Stock for the general Benefit of the Charity; and the In|tere&s;t ari&s;ing from it hath been, and &s;till is, every Year applied to the Relief and Support of the &s;aid Widows and Orphans, that they may not mourn without a Comforter, and that the Sons and Daughters of the poor Clergy intitled to this Relief, may not be &s;uffered to wander as Vagabonds up and down the Earth, expo&s;ed to tho&s;e Mi&s;eries and Temptations which attend upon extreme Poverty.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> I took a Turn to <HI>Hadley,</HI> famous for the Martyrdom of Dr. <HI>Rowland Taylor,</HI> who was burnt at <HI>Aldham Common, Anno</HI> 1555. On the Place where he was martyr'd, I ob&s;erved a Stone, with this In&s;cription:

<P>It has been a Town Corporate, governed by a Mayor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> being brought again&s;t their Charter, in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> II. it has not been renewed &s;ince. Here are two weekly Markets, and two annual Fairs. It deals much in Corn, and abounds with all manner of Provi&s;ions. The Town is large, and tolerably well built; but being in a Bottom, is generally dirty. Its Church is a very hand&s;ome Building, graced with a Spire Steeple, and being near the Middle of the Town, is
<PB N="29" REF="36">
an Ornament to it. 'Tis of &s;ome Note &s;till for the Manufacture of Woollen Cloths, but not &s;o much as formerly.</P>
<P>A little to the South-we&s;t lies <HI>Neyland,</HI> a large Market-town, in a Bottom; upon the <HI>Stour</HI>; over which is a very good Bridge. The Bays-trade is car|ried on here too.</P>
<P>Higher up to the North-we&s;t, upon the &s;ame River, &s;tands <HI>Sudbury,</HI> &s;ituate on the <HI>Stour</HI>; which is now made navigable for Barges from <HI>Maningtree</HI> hither, and gives a great Addition to their Trade. It is a very antient Town, governed by a Mayor, and at pre&s;ent con&s;i&s;ts of three di&s;tinct Pari&s;hes, which have each a hand&s;ome and large Church; the Names of which are <HI>St. Gregory</HI>'s, <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s, and <HI>All-Saints</HI>; tho' <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s is rather a Chapel of Ea&s;e to <HI>St. Gregory</HI>'s. This Town is pretty well built, but the Streets, being unpaved, are dirty. It has an hand&s;ome Bridge over the <HI>Stour,</HI> leading into <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> This Town was one of the fir&s;t Places where King <HI>Edward</HI> III. placed the <HI>Flemings,</HI> whom he allured hither to teach the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> the Art of manufacturing their own Wool, of which before they knew nothing; and here the Woollen Trade hath continued ever &s;ince in a flouri&s;hing Way.

<P><HI>Simon Theobald,</HI> &s;urnamed <HI>Sudbury,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> tran&s;lated thither from <HI>London Anno</HI> 1375. was a Native of this Town. He was mur|dered at the In&s;tigation of one <HI>John Ball,</HI> a &s;editious and fanatical Preacher in <HI>Wat Tyler</HI>'s Rebellion. He was a Prelate of very good Character for Learn|ing and Charity. He built the Upper-end of <HI>St. Gregory</HI>'s Church in <HI>Sudbury,</HI> where his Head is &s;till &s;hewn: it was, not long &s;ince, intire, covered with the Fle&s;h and Skin dried by Art, the Mouth wide open, occa&s;ioned by Convul&s;ions thro' the hard

Death he died, having &s;uffered eight Blows before his Head was cut off. He founded in the Place where his Father's Hou&s;e &s;tood, a neat College, which he furni&s;hed with Secular Prie&s;ts, and other Mini&s;ters, and likewi&s;e endowed it bountifully.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Sudbury</HI> is <HI>Melford,</HI> a plea&s;ant Village, and perhaps the large&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> being about a Mile in Length. The Church is a very fine Edifice, and &s;tands at the North-end of it. There were two Chantries in it. <HI>Weaver</HI> &s;ays, That on &s;ome Part of the Out&s;ide of the Church are the&s;e Words: <HI>Pray for the Souls of</HI> John Clopton, <HI>and</HI> Richard Boteler, <HI>of who&s;e Goodys this Chapel was built</HI>; and that &s;everal of the antient Family of <HI>Clopton</HI> are there buried. This Town has given two Lord Mayors to <HI>London,</HI> Sir <HI>John Milburn,</HI> Draper, in 1521. and Sir <HI>Roger Martin,</HI> Mercer, in 1567. It has an annual Fair, divers good Inns, many hand&s;ome Hou&s;es, and creditable Inhabitants. Here lived the unhappy Mr. <HI>Drew,</HI> who in the Year 1739. was barbarou&s;ly murdered; and his Son, Mr. <HI>Charles Drew,</HI> executed for it, who effected it either with his own Hands, or by tho&s;e of another Per&s;on, whom he procured to do it, for the &s;ake of enjoying his E&s;tate. The Parricide was attended with Circum&s;tances of great Horror; but the Parti|culars being well known, and the Fact &s;o recent, I &s;hall not &s;ay any more of it here.</P>
<P>In my Way from hence to <HI>St. Edmond's-bury,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed due North thro' <HI>Lavenham,</HI> or <HI>Lanham,</HI> a pretty good Town, &s;tanding upon a Branch of the River <HI>Breton.</HI> It has a &s;pacious Market-place, which was formerly of much better Account than at pre&s;ent. It had many Years ago great Advantage from its Trade in Blue Cloths; but tho' this is lo&s;t, yet it has a good Trade for Serges, Shalloons, Says, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made here; &s;pins a great deal of fine Yarn for <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and has of late flouri&s;hed much, by &s;etting up
<PB N="31" REF="38">
a Hall for &s;elling Wool, the Town being conveni|ently &s;ituated for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Church and Steeple here are ju&s;tly accounted the fine&s;t in the County. It is &s;ituate on a Hill on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Town, the Steeple being 137 Feet high. It has Six tuneable Bells in it, and the Inha|bitants boa&s;t much of their Tenor, which, they &s;ay, out-does all the Bells in <HI>England</HI> for its deep Note; and tho' it weighs but 23 Hundred Weight, they &s;ay it &s;ounds like a Bell of 40 Hundred. This Town is al&s;o remarkable for the many charitable Beque&s;ts made to its Poor; and gave <HI>London</HI> a Lord Mayor in 1462. in the Per&s;on of Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke,</HI> Draper, the Son of <HI>Robert Cooke</HI> of this Town.</P>
<P>Ea&s;t of <HI>Lavenham,</HI> and pretty near it, is <HI>Bilde&s;ton,</HI> a Market-town, noted for the Cloathing-trade, its good Church, its mean Buildings, and Dirtine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Bury St. Edmunds</HI> is &s;ituate on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the River <HI>Lach,</HI> which within the&s;e few Years has been made navigable from <HI>Lynn</HI> to <HI>Fornham,</HI> a Mile North of the Town. It is &s;o regularly built, that almo&s;t all the Streets cut one another at Right An|gles. It &s;tands on an ea&s;y A&s;cent, and overlooks a mo&s;t fruitful inclo&s;ed Country on the South and South-we&s;t; on the North and North-we&s;t the mo&s;t delightful champain Fields, which extend them&s;elves to <HI>Lynn,</HI> and that Part of the <HI>Norfolk</HI> Coa&s;t; and on the Ea&s;t the Country is partly inclo&s;ed, and partly open. No wonder then that it is called the <HI>Montpellier</HI> of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and even of <HI>England:</HI> and indeed a certain antient Author &s;ays no more than it de&s;erves;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Sun &s;hines not upon a Town more agreeable in its Situation."</Q></P>
<P>It is governed by an Alderman, which is their chief Magi&s;trate, a Recorder, 12 capital Burge&s;&s;es, and 24 common Burge&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>It has two plentiful weekly Markets on <HI>Wedne&s;days</HI> and <HI>Saturdays</HI>; and three annual Fairs; one three
<PB N="32" REF="39">
Days before and three Days after the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Matthew</HI>; and it is generally protracted to an un|certain Length, for the Diver&s;ion of the Nobility and Gentry that re&s;ort to it, in great Numbers.</P>
<P>The Abbey, once &s;o famous, was fir&s;t built of Wood by <HI>Sigebert</HI> King of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Angles,</HI> &s;oon after Chri&s;tianity was planted here; and when fini&s;hed, about the Year 638, that King retired into it, and &s;hut him&s;elf up from the World.</P>
<P>King <HI>Edmund,</HI> from whom the Town takes its Name, began to reign over the <HI>Ea&s;t-Angles Anno</HI> 855, in the 14th Year of his Age, and reigned 15 Years; being killed <HI>Anno</HI> 870, as &s;uppo&s;ed, at <HI>Hoxne,</HI> at 29 Years old, and his Corps was 33 Years after removed to <HI>Bury.</HI> The Abbey being much enriched thereby, the Monks, who were of the <HI>Benedictine</HI> Order, found means, about the Year 1020, to get it intirely to them&s;elves, excluding the Seculars; and King <HI>Canute,</HI> in the 4th Year of his Reign, founded a more magnificent Church, in Honour of St. <HI>Edmund,</HI> which was fini&s;hed in 12 Years, and dedicated to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> St. <HI>Mary,</HI> and St. <HI>Edmund.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Uvius,</HI> Prior of <HI>Hulm,</HI> who was con&s;ecrated the fir&s;t Abbot, <HI>Anno</HI> 1020, got the Abbey exempted from Epi&s;copal Juri&s;diction, and encompa&s;&s;ed that and the Town with a Wall and Ditch; the Ruins of which, in &s;everal Places, are &s;till to be &s;een: and the Abbots afterwards were made Parliamentary Barons. But in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. it run the common Fate of all Religious Hou&s;es, and that Prince put an End to all its Glory.</P>
<P>When the Abbey was in its Pro&s;perity, there was a Chapel at every one of the five Gates, and the Town abounded with Chapels and Oratories. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible the&s;e might be Ho&s;pitals; for there was an Ho&s;pital of <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s without <HI>Ri&s;hy gate</HI>; an Ho&s;pital of <HI>St. Saviour</HI>'s without <HI>North-gate</HI>; an
<PB N="33" REF="40">
Ho&s;pital of <HI>St. Nicolas</HI> at or near <HI>Ea&s;t-gate</HI>; and <HI>God's-hou&s;e,</HI> or <HI>St. John</HI>'s, at the <HI>South-gate</HI>; a College of Prie&s;ts with a Gild to the <HI>Holy</HI> or <HI>Sweet Name of Je&s;us,</HI> the Situation of which I could not find; and an Hou&s;e of <HI>Grey Friers</HI> at <HI>Babwell,</HI> or the <HI>Toll-gate.</HI> But at this time there are only two Churches, which indeed are very beautiful and &s;tately, and &s;tand in the &s;ame Church-yard; the one dedicated to St. <HI>Mary,</HI> the other, built in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. to St. <HI>James.</HI> The latter has a convenient Library; and at the We&s;t End of the South I&s;le are interred <HI>James Reynolds,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> late Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and his Lady, to who&s;e Memories two large Monuments are erected. The Church of <HI>St. Mary</HI> has, on the North-&s;ide of the Altar, (to which we approach by a fine A&s;cent of Six Steps) the Tomb of <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>France,</HI> Si&s;ter to <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and Wife to <HI>Charles Brandon,</HI> Duke of <HI>Suffolk.</HI> Her Coffin is of Lead, and has this In&s;cription on it; <HI>Mary Queen,</HI> 1533. <HI>of France. Edmund H----.</HI> There are other hand|&s;ome Monuments in this Church.</P>
<P>The other mo&s;t remarkable publick Buildings are the Abbey-gate, which is &s;till a fine Monument of what the Abbey once was; the Guild hall; the Wool-hall; the Shire-hou&s;e; the Market-cro&s;s; and the Grammar-School, endowed by King <HI>Ed|ward</HI> VI.</P>
<P>Such as is the Town for Situation, is the Neighbourhood and Gentry about it for Politene&s;s; and no Place glories in brighter Ladies, or better Families.</P>
<P>In the Path-way between the two Churches it was that <HI>Arundel Coke,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Barri&s;ter at Law, in the Year 1721. attempted (with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of one <HI>Woodbourne,</HI> a barbarous A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in) an unheard-of Outrage on his Brother-in-law, <HI>Edward Cri&s;,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for the &s;ake of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing what he had. He had in|vited
<PB N="34" REF="41">
him, his Wife and Family, to Supper with him; and in the Night, on Pretence of going to &s;ee a Friend to them both, he led him into the Church|yard, when, on a Signal he gave, the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in made at Mr. <HI>Cri&s;p</HI> with a Hedge-bill, and in a mo&s;t ter|rible manner mangled his Head and Face; and &s;up|po&s;ing him dead, there left him; and <HI>Coke</HI> returned, as if he knew nothing of the Matter, to the Com|pany. But it happening that Mr. <HI>Cri&s;p</HI> was not killed, and coming back to <HI>Coke</HI>'s Hou&s;e to the Company all bloody, and cruelly mangled, the &s;hocking Sight amazed and confounded them all; <HI>Coke,</HI> that he was not dead; the re&s;t, that he had met with &s;o &s;trange a Di&s;a&s;ter. Mr. <HI>Cri&s;p</HI> has &s;urvived this Outrage many Years, and <HI>Coke</HI> and <HI>Woodburne,</HI> the hired A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, were ju&s;tly executed for a Villainy &s;o dete&s;table, that it hardly had its Parallel. The Gentleman being not killed, the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were tried and condemned on the Statute for defacing and di&s;membring, called <HI>The Coventry Act:</HI> And <HI>Coke</HI> was &s;o <HI>good</HI> a Lawyer, and &s;o <HI>hardened</HI> a Wretch, that he thought to have &s;aved him&s;elf, by pleading that he intended not to <HI>deface,</HI> but to <HI>kill.</HI> Some nice People &s;ay, the Law was a little &s;trained in their Puni&s;hment, as the Gentleman recovered; but, &s;urely, if in any Ca&s;e the <HI>Letter</HI> might be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and the <HI>Spirit</HI> be brought in Aid of it, it was right in this: and it would have been next to a national Di&s;grace, not to have a Law that would reach &s;o flagrant and complicated a Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>There is very little or no Manufacturing in this Town, except Spinning; the chief Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Place depending upon the neighbouring Gentry, who cannot fail to cau&s;e Trade enough by the Ex|pence of their Families and Equipages, among the People of a Country Town. Our Monarchs, <HI>Edward</HI> I. and II. had a Mint at <HI>Bury,</HI> and &s;ome of their Pennies coined there, are yet remaining.

<P>This Town is famous for two great Events: One, That a Parliament was held here in the Year 1447. in the 25th Year of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. The other, That at the Meeting of this Parliament, the good <HI>Humphry,</HI> Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> Regent of the Kingdom, during the Ab&s;ence of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. and in the Minority of his Son <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and, to his la&s;t Hour, the Safeguard of the whole Nation, and Darling of the People, was ba&s;ely murdered here; by who&s;e Death the Gate was opened to that dreadful War between the Hou&s;es of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> which ended in the Confu&s;ion of the very Race, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to have contrived that Murder.</P>
<P>As I made &s;ome Stay at <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> and <HI>Bury,</HI> being obliged to wait the Lei&s;ure of a Gentleman who accompanied me Part of this Journey, I made &s;everal Excur&s;ions more Inland than I had at fir&s;t intended when I &s;et out, and vi&s;ited the following Towns:</P>
<P>As, fir&s;t, <HI>Boxford,</HI> which is about Seven Miles from <HI>Sudbury,</HI> and is a neat and well-built Village, and carries on a con&s;iderable Traffick.</P>
<P>At <HI>Bures</HI> on the <HI>Stour</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> was crown'd, and not at <HI>Bury.</HI> It has a good Bridge on that River. <HI>Anno</HI> 1733. the Spire of the Steeple of the hand&s;ome Church here was burnt by Lightning, the Bell-frames de&s;troyed, and the Bells melted.</P>
<P><HI>Clare</HI> is &s;ituate on the <HI>Stour,</HI> about 14 Miles from <HI>Bury,</HI> and is but a poor Town, and dirty, the Streets being unpaved. But yet the Civil and Spiri|tual Courts are held at it, and it has a good Church; and &s;hews &s;till the Ruins of a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, and an old Mona&s;tery. It gives Title of Earl to his Grace the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> of the <HI>Pelham</HI> Family, as it did to that of <HI>Holles</HI> before.</P>

<P><HI>Stratford</HI> is a thorough-fare Village of great Traf|fick, and is employed in the Woollen Manufactures.</P>
<P><HI>Ea&s;terbergholt,</HI> near four Miles from <HI>Stratford,</HI> and half a Mile North of the <HI>Stour,</HI> is a large and hand&s;ome Village, employ'd in the Woollen Way, but not to &s;o great a Degree as formerly. It has a good Church, but the Steeple is in Ruins, and the Bells are rung by Hand, in a kind of Cage &s;et up in the Church-yard. A little South of the Church is an elegant Hou&s;e of Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Hankey,</HI> Alderman of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Heming&s;ton</HI> may bear the Mention for the merry Tenure by which that Manor was held, according to <HI>Camden,</HI> by Serjeanty, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or being obliged every <HI>Chri&s;tmas-day</HI> to perform before the King one <HI>Saltus,</HI> one <HI>Sufflatus,</HI> and one <HI>Bombulus</HI>: or, as is

<P><HI>Needham</HI> is a thorough-fare Town, about nine Miles North-we&s;t from <HI>Ip&s;wich.</HI> It is tolerably well built, has &s;everal con&s;iderable Dealers in it, and formerly carried on a large Trade in the Woollen Manu|factures, which it has lo&s;t for &s;ome Years.</P>
<P><HI>Bilde&s;ton</HI> is a meanly built, dirty Town, but has a good Church.</P>

<P><HI>Ickworth</HI> was once a Pari&s;h, but now is a noble Park, in which is the Seat of the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> It is a Place of great Antiquity, and what confirms it is, what that learned Antiquarian Dr. <HI>Battley,</HI> Arch|deacon of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> writes, That in his Memory a large Pot of <HI>Roman</HI> Money was found here.</P>
<P><HI>Debenham</HI> is a tolerably clean, tho' mean-built Town, and among very dirty and heavy Roads, being &s;eated on a Hill. The Church is a good Building, the Market-place tolerable, and there is a Free-&s;chool founded by Appointment of Sir <HI>Robert Hitcham.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Woodbridge</HI> is a Market-town, &s;ituate on the River <HI>Deben,</HI> about 11 Miles from the Sea.

It has a fine Church and Steeple, and traded formerly in Sackcloth, and now in refining Salt. The Shire-hall is a hand&s;ome Pile of Building, where the Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions for this Part of the County are held, and under it is the Corn-cro&s;s. One Street in it, called <HI>Stone-&s;treet,</HI> is well-built and paved, but the re&s;t are dirty. The Market-place and Thorough|fare are al&s;o well enough built; but the re&s;t of the Town is mean. The Quays and Ware-hou&s;es are very commodious, and here is a Grammar-&s;chool, and an Alms-hou&s;e, erected in 1587. by <HI>Thomas Seckford,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Reque&s;ts, for Thirteen Men and Three Women, which is well endowed. It has a pretty good Market on <HI>Wedne&s;days,</HI> and two annual Fairs.</P>

<P><HI>Orford</HI> is &s;ituate on the North-we&s;t Side of the River <HI>Ore,</HI> whence it had its Name.

It has two Streets, each near a Mile long; but its Breadth, which was more con&s;iderable formerly, is not pro|portionable, and the Sea has of late Years &s;wallowed up one whole Street. The Town, tho' meanly built, is clean and well peopled in the Sea-faring way. The Sea wa&s;hes the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of it, and the River <HI>Ald</HI> runs not far from the South-end of it, affording a good Quay. In the adjacent Seas, Sprats, Soles, and Lob&s;ters, are caught in abun|dance. The Town trades to <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> for Coals; and from hence Corn is tran&s;ported. The Manor of <HI>Aldburgh,</HI> as al&s;o the Manors of <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Ta&s;kards</HI> in the Neighbourhood, formerly belonged to the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Snape,</HI> and were fir&s;t granted with that Mona&s;tery, to Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> and &s;oon after to <HI>Thomas</HI> Duke of <HI>Norfolk. Aldburgh</HI> is pretty well &s;ituated for Strength, and has &s;everal Pieces of Cannon for its Defence. The Church, which is a good Edifice, &s;tands on a Hill, a little We&s;t of the Town. It is a Town Corporate, governed by Two Bailiffs, Ten capital Burge&s;&s;es, and Twenty-four inferior Officers.</P>
<P>From <HI>Aldburgh,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed thro' <HI>Saxminden,</HI> a little dirty Market-town, to <HI>Dunwich,</HI> a very antient Town, which, by <HI>Roman</HI> Coins dug up there, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a <HI>Roman</HI> Station. In the Reign of <HI>the Conqueror,</HI> it was &s;o con&s;iderable a Place,
<PB N="42" REF="49">
that it had 130 Burge&s;&s;es, and was valued to that King at 50<HI>l.</HI> and 60,000 Herrings. We read that in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. it was a very famous Village, well &s;tored with Riches, and fortified with a Rampart, &s;ome Remains of which &s;till appear.</P>
<P>Before the&s;e Times, in the Reign of King <HI>Sige|bert, Anno</HI> 630. <HI>Dunwich</HI> was a Bi&s;hop's See; and &s;o continued, till the <HI>Conqueror</HI> made his Chaplain Bi&s;hop of it, and tran&s;lated the See to <HI>Thetford,</HI> which was afterwards tran&s;lated from thence to <HI>Norwich.</HI></P>
<P>There were &s;everal Religious Hou&s;es in <HI>Dunwich,</HI> and, &s;ome pretend, no le&s;s than fifty Churches: but there is a certain Account of &s;ix Pari&s;h-churches, and three Chapels, be&s;ides the &s;everal Religious Hou&s;es. Four of the&s;e Pari&s;h-churches, and the three Chapels, have been long devoured by the Sea; and one of the others met with the &s;ame Fate in this Age, &s;o that there is only one now &s;tanding; and what remains of this once famous Place, is but a pitiful Parcel of &s;orry Cottages.</P>
<P>Hereabouts they begin to talk of Herrings, and the Fi&s;hery. And here al&s;o, and at <HI>Swole</HI> or <HI>South|would,</HI> the next Sea-port, they cure Sprats in the &s;ame manner as they do Herrings at <HI>Yarmouth.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Dunwich</HI> we went to <HI>Southwould,</HI> plea&s;antly &s;ituated on a Hill, and almo&s;t &s;urrounded with the Sea, and the River <HI>Biyth,</HI> over which it has a Bridge. It drives a con&s;iderable Trade in Salt and old Beer, and in Herrings, Sprats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Church is large, and very &s;trong. The Bay, called corruptly <HI>Sowl</HI> or <HI>Sole-bay,</HI> is a commodious Place for Anchor|age, and occa&s;ions a great Re&s;ort of Mariners to it, which adds greatly to its Trade and Commerce.</P>
<P>The Traffick of my Friend at <HI>Woodbridge, Ald|burgh,</HI> and this Place, gave me the Opportunity I hinted at, of making Excur&s;ions into the main-in|land Parts of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> adjacent to tho&s;e Towns,
<PB N="43" REF="50">
which I &s;hall tran&s;cribe from my Memorandum-book, in the Order I &s;et them down.</P>
<P><HI>Ufford</HI> is at pre&s;ent of no great Remark; but has the Ruins of a Chapel, called <HI>Sogenhoc</HI> Chapel. <HI>Richard Lufkin</HI> was Rector of this Pari&s;h 57 Years, and was buried <HI>September</HI> 23. 1678. in the 111th Year of his Age. He performed all the Offices of his Function to the la&s;t, and preached the <HI>Sunday</HI> before his Death. He was plundered in the grand Rebellion, and lo&s;t all that he had except a Silver Spoon, which he pre&s;erved by hiding it in his Sleeve.</P>
<P>In the Hundred of <HI>Hart&s;mere</HI> &s;tands <HI>Broome,</HI> a noble old Man&s;ion, which for many Ages has been the Seat of the noble Family of <HI>Cornwallis.</HI> In this Pari&s;h of <HI>Broome</HI> is an Alms-hou&s;e for poor Widows, fronting the Hall; but not endowed.</P>
<P><HI>Wickham</HI> Market is &s;ituated about four Miles from <HI>Woodbridge.</HI> The Church is built on a Hill, and tho' but 23 Yards high, affords the be&s;t Pro&s;pect of any in <HI>Suffolk</HI>; for in a clear Day, near 50 Pari&s;h-churches may be &s;een from it. It is now only a Village, but has &s;ome Trade, and the Civil and Spiritual Courts are held in it.</P>
<P><HI>Snape</HI> was once noted for a famous Mona&s;tery, few Remains of which are to be &s;een. It has a con|&s;iderable annual Fair for Hor&s;es, which la&s;ts four Days, beginning <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 11. to which the <HI>London</HI> Jockeys re&s;ort.</P>
<P>At <HI>Sudbourne</HI> is a fine Seat of the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Hereford.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> is the Seat of the Earl of <HI>Rochford,</HI> formerly belonging to the <HI>Wingfield</HI> Family.</P>
<P><HI>Letheringham</HI> was of Note for a little Priory, which was obtained at the Di&s;&s;olution by Sir <HI>Antony Wingfield</HI>; and Sir <HI>Henry Spelman</HI> tells us, that, as a Judgment for the Sacrilege, he died without I&s;&s;ue Male. It was converted into a Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, and is now the Seat of the antient Family of the

<HI>Nauntons.</HI> Sir <HI>Roger Naunton</HI> was in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> I. Secretary of State, and Ma&s;ter of the Court of Wards and Liveries. He died <HI>Anno</HI> 1630. In the Abbey is a long Gallery, adorned with &s;everal valuable Pictures: And in <HI>Letheringham</HI> Church are, &s;ome elegant and magnificent Monuments of the <HI>Wingfields</HI> and <HI>Nauntons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rendel&s;ham</HI> was antiently famous for being the Royal Re&s;idence of <HI>Redwald,</HI> King of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Angles. Hugh Fitz-Otho</HI> procured a Market and Fair for this Town, from King <HI>Edward</HI> I. Digging here about 50 Years ago, an antient Silver Crown was found weighing about 60 Ounces, &s;uppo&s;ed to have belonged to <HI>Redwald,</HI> or &s;ome other King of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Angles</HI>; which was &s;old and melted down for the &s;ake of the Metal.</P>
<P>At <HI>Butley</HI> was a Priory of Canons Regular; founded by <HI>Ranulph de Glanville,</HI> chief Ju&s;tice of <HI>England,</HI> to the Honour of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin. The Ruins of the Abbey, which are &s;till to be &s;een, &s;hew it to have been very large; and the Gate-hou&s;e is a magnificent Building: it remains intire, and is embelli&s;hed in the Front with many Coats of Arms, finely cut in Stone.</P>
<P><HI>Framlingham</HI> is &s;ituate North of <HI>Aldburgh,</HI> a large Town, well-built, and plea&s;antly &s;eated near the Head of the River <HI>Ore</HI>; it has a &s;pacious Market-place; the Church is built of black Flint, and is a very &s;tately and noble Edifice, wherein &s;everal of the <HI>Mowbrays</HI> Dukes of <HI>Norfolk</HI> lie buried. The Ca&s;tle is a fair Piece of Antiquity, being a large, beautiful and &s;trong Building; and contains within the Walls now &s;tanding an Acre 1 Rood 11 Perches, and was formerly much larger. Its Walls are 44 Feet high, and thick, and are &s;tanding pretty intire; and it has 13 Towers, 14 Feet higher than the Walls, two of which are Watch-towers. It was both by Art and Nature formerly very &s;trong.
<PB N="45" REF="52">
There are two good Alms-hou&s;es, and a Free-&s;chool, founded by Sir <HI>Robert Hitcham,</HI> (who is interred in the Church) for 40 poor Boys, who are taught to read, write, and ca&s;t Accounts, and 10<HI>l.</HI> is given to &s;ettle each of them Apprentice. This Gentleman bought of the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> the Ca&s;tle, Manor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and gave them to <HI>Pembroke-hall</HI> in <HI>Cambridge.</HI> To this Ca&s;tle Queen <HI>Mary</HI> I. retired, when the Lady <HI>Jane</HI> was proclaimed Queen by the <HI>Northum|berland</HI> Faction.</P>
<P><HI>Blithburg</HI> was formerly a Place of good Note, but now has nothing to recommend it but its Church, which is a fine old Building, and kept in good Repair.</P>
<P>At <HI>Chedi&s;ton,</HI> is the fine Seat of <HI>Walter Plumer,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who bought it lately, and rebuilt the Hall in a beautiful manner.</P>
<P><HI>Hale&s;worth</HI> is North-ea&s;t of <HI>Framlingham,</HI> a large and good Market-town, &s;ituated upon the River <HI>Blyth,</HI> which runs thro' it. The Streets are clean, and partly paved. It has a very neat Church, beauti|fully decorated within, and is noted for Linen-yarn, which is &s;pun in the Neighbourhood, and &s;old here.</P>
<P><HI>Hoxne</HI> is the Place where <HI>Edmund</HI> King of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Angles</HI> was murdered by the Pagan <HI>Danes,</HI> be|cau&s;e he would not renounce his Faith, <HI>Anno</HI> 870. and his Body was removed to <HI>Bury,</HI> as above-mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>Bungay</HI> is a well-frequented Market-town, plea|&s;antly &s;ituate upon and almo&s;t &s;urrounded with the <HI>Waveney,</HI> which is navigable thither for Barges. It lies North-ea&s;t of <HI>Hale&s;worth.</HI> Its Streets are mo&s;tly unpaved; but the Town is hand&s;ome and well-built &s;ince the great Fire, which broke out about Sun|ri&s;ing on <HI>March</HI> 1. 1688-9. in a &s;mall uninhabited Hou&s;e; and in four Hours time con&s;umed the whole Town, except one &s;mall Street. The whole Lo&s;s was computed at 29,896<HI>l.</HI> and upwards. It has two Pari&s;h-churches, one of which is a very noble
<PB N="46" REF="53">
one; and has a beautiful Steeple. The Ruins of a <HI>Benedictine</HI> Nunnery, and a very &s;trong Ca&s;tle, are &s;till to be &s;een here. The latter was &s;o &s;trong, that <HI>Hugh Bigod,</HI> its Owner, in the Wars between the Empre&s;s <HI>Maud</HI> and King <HI>Stephen,</HI> with the latter of whom he &s;ided, made this Boa&s;t upon it:
<Q><L><HI>Were I in my Ca&s;tle of</HI> Bungay,</L>
<L><HI>Upon the River</HI> Waveney,</L>
<L><HI>I would not care for the King of</HI> Cockney.</L></Q></P>
<P>But yet he was forced afterwards to compound with King <HI>Henry</HI> II. for its Pre&s;ervation. It has a Gram|mar-&s;chool with 10 Scholar&s;hips, for <HI>Emanuel</HI> College <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>In this Excur&s;ion I &s;tretched to <HI>Beccles,</HI> &s;till fur|ther North-ea&s;t; a large ill-built Market-town, &s;ituate on the <HI>Waveney,</HI> which is navigable hence from <HI>Yarmouth</HI> to <HI>Bungay,</HI> as I have &s;aid. It has a noble Church and Steeple, and a Grammar and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> School, well endowed. It has a plentiful Market, and a Common of above 1000 Acres. The Streets are well paved and clean, but the Hou&s;es are but ordinary. The Ruins of another Church, called <HI>Ingate</HI> Church are to be &s;een here, which was for|merly the Pari&s;h Church to the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Burgh-ca&s;tle</HI> &s;cituate at the Mouth of the <HI>Wave|ney,</HI> was a Place of con&s;iderable Note in the Time of the <HI>Romans.</HI> The Walls on the Ea&s;t, North, and South Sides, are &s;till &s;tanding, pretty intire; and the River being a Defence on the We&s;t, no Wall was wanting there.</P>
<P>I returned from the&s;e Excur&s;ions to <HI>Southwould,</HI> in order to proceed on my Journey, according to my fir&s;t Plan. But it may not be ami&s;s to mention, before I proceed, That this Town is made famous by an Engagement at Sea, in the Year 1672, between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleets, in the Bay oppo&s;ite to
<PB N="47" REF="54">
the Town; in which the brave <HI>Montague</HI> Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> Admiral under the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> lo&s;t his Life: his Ship, <HI>Royal Prince,</HI> carrying 100 Guns, which was under him commanded by Sir <HI>Edward Spragg,</HI> was burnt, and &s;everal other Ships lo&s;t, and about 600 Seamen.</P>
<P>At this Town in particular, and &s;o at all the Towns on this Coa&s;t, from <HI>Orfordne&s;s</HI> to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> is the ordinary Place where our Summer Friends the Swal|lows fir&s;t land when they come to vi&s;it us; and here they may be &s;aid to begin their Voyage, when they go back into warmer Climates. I was &s;ome Years before at this Place, about the Beginning of <HI>October</HI>; and lodging in a Hou&s;e that looked into the Church-yard, I ob&s;erved in the Evening an unu&s;ual Multitude of Swallows &s;itting on the Leads of the Church, and covering the Tops of &s;everal Hou&s;es round about. This led me to inquire what was the Meaning of &s;uch a prodigious Multitude of Swallows &s;itting there: I was an&s;wered, That this was the Sea&s;on when the Swallows, their Food fail|ing here, began to leave us, and return to the Country, where-ever it be, from whence they came; and that this being the neare&s;t Land to the oppo&s;ite Coa&s;t, and the Wind contrary, they were waiting for a Gale, and might be &s;aid to be <HI>Wind-bound.</HI></P>
<P>This was more evident to me, when in the Morn|ing I found the Wind had come about to the North|we&s;t in the Night, and there was not one Swallow to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that the Swallows neither come hither merely for warm Weather, nor retire merely from Cold: they, like the Shoals of Fi&s;h in the Sea, pur&s;ue their Prey; being a voracious Creature, and feeding as they fly; for their Food is the In&s;ects, of which, in our Summer Evenings, in damp and moi&s;t Places, the Air is full; and when cold Weather comes in, and kills the In&s;ects, then Nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="48" REF="55">
compels the Swallows to quit us, and follow their Food to &s;ome other Climate.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing of the Swallows is ob&s;erved no-where &s;o much as on this Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t; namely from above <HI>Harwich</HI> to the Ea&s;t Point of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> called <HI>Wintertonne&s;s,</HI> North; which is oppo&s;ite to <HI>Holland.</HI> We know nothing of them any farther North; the Pa&s;&s;age of the Sea being, as I &s;uppo&s;e, too broad from <HI>Flambro'</HI> Head, and the Shore of <HI>Holderne&s;s</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Part of <HI>England</HI> is remarkable for being the fir&s;t where the Feeding and Fattening of Sheep and other Cattle, with Turneps, was fir&s;t practi&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> which is made a very great Part of the Improvement of their Lands to this Day; and from whence the Practice is &s;pread over mo&s;t of the Ea&s;t and South Part of <HI>England,</HI> to the great enriching of the Farmers, and Increa&s;e of fat Cattle: and tho' &s;ome have objected again&s;t the Goodne&s;s of the Fle&s;h thus fed with Turneps, and have fan&s;ied it would ta&s;te of the Root; yet upon Experience 'tis found, that there is no Rea&s;on for this Fancy.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Suffolk</HI> is particularly famous for furni&s;hing the City of <HI>London,</HI> and all the Counties round, with Turkeys; in&s;omuch that more Turkeys are bred in this County, and the Part of <HI>Norfolk</HI> that joins to it, for Sale, than in all the re&s;t of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Nor will this be found an incon&s;iderable Article, if it be true, that 300 Droves of Turkeys have pa&s;&s;ed, in one Sea&s;on, over <HI>Stratford-bridge</HI> on the River <HI>Stour,</HI> on the Road from <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> to <HI>London</HI>; each Drove generally containing from 300 to 1000 Turkeys, which at 500, one with another, will be 150,000 in all; and yet the Numbers which are driven by <HI>New Market-heath,</HI> and the open Country, and the Fore&s;t, and al&s;o tho&s;e by <HI>Sudbury</HI> and <HI>Clare,</HI> are much greater.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="56">For the further Supplies of the Markets of <HI>London</HI> with Poultry, in which the&s;e Countries particularly abound, they have within the&s;e few Years found it practicable to make the Gee&s;e travel on foot too, and prodigious Numbers are brought up to <HI>London</HI> in like Droves from the farthe&s;t Parts of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> even from the Fen-Country, about <HI>Lynn, Downham, Wi&s;bich,</HI> and the <HI>Wa&s;hes</HI>; as al&s;o from all the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI>; and 'tis very frequent now to meet 1000, or 2000, in a Drove. They begin to drive them generally in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> when the Harve&s;t is almo&s;t over, that the Gee&s;e may feed on the Stub|ble as they go. Thus they hold on to the End of <HI>October,</HI> when the Roads begin to be too &s;tiff and deep for their broad Feet and &s;hort Legs to march in.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides &s;uch Methods of driving the&s;e Creatures on Foot, they have of late invented a new kind of Carriage, being Carts formed on purpo&s;e, with four Stories or Stages, to put the Poultry in, one above another, whereby one Cart will carry a very great Number; and for the &s;moother going, they drive with two Hor&s;es abrea&s;t, like a Coach; thus quarter|ing the Road for the Ea&s;e of the Poultry, and changing Hor&s;es, they travel Night and Day; &s;o that they bring the Fowls 70, 80, or 100 Miles in two Days and one Night: The Hor&s;es are fa&s;ten'd together by a Piece of Wood lying cro&s;s-wi&s;e upon their Necks, by which they are kept even and toge|ther, and the Driver &s;its on the Top of the Cart, as in the publick Carriages for the Army, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In this manner va&s;t Numbers of Turkey-poults and Chickens are carried to <HI>London</HI> every Year, which yield a good Price at Market; and more out of this County than any other Part of <HI>England,</HI> which is the Rea&s;on of my &s;peaking of it here.</P>
<P>In this Part, which we call <HI>High Suffolk,</HI> there are not &s;o many Families of Gentry or Nobility, as in the other Side of the Country: But 'tis ob&s;erved,
<PB N="50" REF="57">
that tho' their Seats are not here, their E&s;tates are; and the Plea&s;ure of <HI>We&s;t Suffolk</HI> is much of it &s;up|ported by the Wealth of <HI>High Suffolk:</HI> For the Richne&s;s of the Lands, and Application of the Peo|ple to all Kinds of Improvement, are &s;carce credible. The Farmers al&s;o are &s;o very con&s;iderable, and their Farms and Dairies &s;o large, that 'tis very frequent for a Farmer to have 1000<HI>l.</HI> Stock upon his Farm in Cows only.</P>
<P>From <HI>Southwould,</HI> Coa&s;t-wi&s;e, I proceeded to <HI>Leo&s;toff,</HI> a con&s;iderable Market-town, &s;tanding near the Sea. It is indifferently well built. The Church, which is &s;ituate near a Mile on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Town, is a good Building; but for the Ea&s;e of its Inhabitants, there is a Chapel in the Town, wherein divine Service is &s;ometimes celebrated. The <HI>Ne&s;s</HI> below the North-end of the Town is (&s;ince the wa&s;hing away of <HI>Ea&s;tonne&s;s</HI>) the mo&s;t Ea&s;tern Point of Land in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Its principal Trade is Fi&s;hing for Herrings and Maycril. It has a noted Market weekly on <HI>Wedne&s;days</HI>; and two &s;mall Fairs yearly, the one on the 1&s;t Day of <HI>May,</HI> and the other on the 29th of <HI>September.</HI> Be&s;ides the pre&s;ent Chapel, here was formerly, at the South-end of the Town, a Chapel called <HI>Good-cro&s;s-chapel,</HI> which hath long &s;ince been de&s;troyed by the Sea. This Town, having been Part of the antient Deme&s;nes of the Crown, hath a Charter, and a Town-&s;eal: But the greate&s;t Privilege they now enjoy from their Charter, is, that of not &s;erving on Juries, either at the Se&s;&s;ions or A&s;&s;izes.</P>
<P>From <HI>High Suffolk,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Waveney,</HI> near <HI>Schole-Inn,</HI> and &s;o came into <HI>NORFOLK.</HI></P>
<P>But, I believe, Sir, you will allow, that I have written enough in all Con&s;cience for one Letter. I will therefore only further add, that I am,</P>

Mo&s;t of the&s;e Towns are very populous and large; but that which is mo&s;t remarkable is, that the whole Country round them is inter&s;per&s;ed with Villages &s;o large, and &s;o full of People, that they are equal to Market-towns in other Counties.</P>
<P>An eminent Weaver of <HI>Norwich</HI> gave me a Scheme of their Trade on this Occa&s;ion, by which, calcu|lating from the Number of Looms at that time employ'd in the City of <HI>Norwich</HI> only, he made it appear very plain, that there were 120,000 People bu&s;y'd in the Woollen and Silk Manufactures of that City only; not that the People all lived in the City, tho' <HI>Norwich</HI> is very large and populous; but they were employ'd for &s;pinning the Yarn u&s;ed for &s;uch Goods as were all made in that City.</P>
<P>This &s;hews the wonderful Extent of the <HI>Norwich</HI> Manufacture, or Stuff-weaving Trade, by which &s;o many thou&s;and Families are maintained.</P>
<P>This Throng of Villages continues thro' all the Ea&s;t Part of the Country, which is of the greate&s;t
<PB N="53" REF="60">
Extent, and where the Manufacture is chiefly carried on: If any Part of it be thin of Inhabitants, it is the We&s;t Part, drawing a Line from about <HI>Brandon,</HI> South, to <HI>Wal&s;ingham,</HI> North. This Part of the Country indeed is full of open Plains, and &s;ome|what &s;andy and barren, but yet feeds great Flocks of good Sheep.</P>
<P><HI>NORWICH</HI> is the Capital of the County, and the Centre of all the Trade and Manufactures which I have ju&s;t mentioned; an antient, large, rich, and populous City: If a Stranger was only to ride thro' or view the City of <HI>Norwich</HI> on ordinary Days, he would be induced to think it a Town without Inha|bitants; but on the contrary, if he was to view the City, either on a <HI>Sabbath-day,</HI> or on any publick Occa&s;ion, he would wonder where all the People could dwell, the Multitude is &s;o great: But the Ca&s;e is this; the Inhabitants being all bu&s;y at their Ma|nufactures, dwell in their Garrets at their Looms, and in their Combing-&s;hops, as they call them, Twi&s;ting-mills, and other Work-hou&s;es; almo&s;t all the Works they are employ'd in, being done within Doors. There are in this City 32 Pari&s;hes, be&s;ides the Cathedral, and a great many Meeting-hou&s;es of Di&s;&s;enters of all Denominations. The Ca&s;tle is antient and decayed, and now for many Years pa&s;t made u&s;e of for a Gaol.</P>
<P>This City, as 'tis &s;aid, was built by the <HI>Saxons</HI> out of the Ruins of <HI>Venta Icenorum,</HI> now called <HI>Ca&s;ter,</HI> where &s;ome Years &s;ince were found &s;everal <HI>Roman</HI> Urns. In the Time of the <HI>Saxons</HI> it was the principal Seat of the <HI>Ea&s;t Angles,</HI> and was reduced to A&s;hes by <HI>Sueno</HI> the <HI>Dane.</HI> It was re-edified, and Famine only compelled it to yield to <HI>William the Conqueror.</HI></P>
<P>The famous Rebellion of <HI>Kett,</HI> the Tanner of <HI>Windham,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. reduced it again to a ruinous State; but it was happily re&s;tored
<PB N="54" REF="61">
by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who &s;ent hither Part of the <HI>Flemings,</HI> that came over from the cruel Per&s;ecution of the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI>; to who&s;e Indu&s;try and Ex|ample is owing the rich Manufacture of Stuffs, for which this City is &s;o famous.</P>
<P>The Walls of this City are reckoned three Miles in Circumference, taking in more Ground than the City of <HI>London,</HI> within the Walls; but much of that Ground lies open in Pa&s;ture-fields and Gardens; nor does it &s;eem to be, like &s;ome antient Places, a decayed declining Town, the Walls only marking out its antient Dimen&s;ions; for we do not &s;ee room to &s;uppo&s;e, that it was ever larger or more populous than it is now. But the Walls &s;eem to be placed, as if it was expected, that the City would in time in|crea&s;e &s;ufficiently to fill them up with Buildings. There are 12 large Gates, which give Entrance to the City.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is a fine Fabrick, and the Spire-Steeple beautiful, and, next <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> the highe&s;t in <HI>England.</HI> It is not antient, the Bi&s;hop's See having been fir&s;t at <HI>Thetford,</HI> from whence it was not tran&s;lated hither till the 12th Century; yet the Church has &s;o many Antiquities in it, that our late great Scholar and Phy&s;ician, Sir <HI>Thomas Brown,</HI> thought it worth his while to write a whole Book to collect the Monuments and In&s;criptions in this Church, to which I refer the Reader. It has an Ho&s;pital in it, for 100 poor Men and Women, and a fine Market-cro&s;s. That called <HI>Bridewell</HI> is a large and mo&s;t beautiful Building of &s;quare Flint.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Yare</HI> runs through it, and is navigable thus far without the Help of Locks or Stops; and being increa&s;ed by other Waters, pa&s;&s;es afterwards through a long Track of the riche&s;t Meadows, and the large&s;t, take them all together, that are any|where in <HI>England,</HI> lying for 30 Miles in Length, from this City to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> including the Return
<PB N="55" REF="62">
of the &s;aid Meadows on the Bank of the <HI>Waveney,</HI> South, and on the River <HI>Thyrn,</HI> North.</P>
<P>There are Six large Bridges over the River running thro' the City, called <HI>Helle&s;den, Co&s;lany, Black-fryers, Tye-bridge, White-friers,</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate</HI> Bridges; and to repair the&s;e Bridges, as al&s;o the Walls and Gates, and the City Wa&s;tes, Stathes and Wharfs, (which were become &s;o ruinous, that the ordinary Revenue of the City was in&s;ufficient for that Purpo&s;e) an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the Year 1725-6. which laid divers Tolls and Impo&s;ts on particular Goods and Merchandizes brought into the City; the Produce of which were al&s;o to repair the great Roads leading from <HI>Norwich</HI> towards <HI>Lon|don</HI>; by which means the&s;e Roads, Bridges, Walls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were put into good Condition, and kept &s;o.</P>
<P>One thing is proper to be mentioned here, which Hi&s;tory accounts not for. It is this: The River <HI>Waveney</HI> is a con&s;iderable River, and of a deep and full Chanel, navigable for large Barges as high as <HI>Beccles</HI> and <HI>Bungay</HI>; it runs for a Cour&s;e of about 50 Miles, between the two Counties of <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> as a Boundary to both; and pu&s;hing for|ward, tho' with a gentle Stream, no one would doubt, when they &s;ee the River growing broader and deeper, and going directly towards the Sea, even to the Edge of the Beach, and within a Mile of the main Ocean, but that it would make its Entrance into the Sea at that Place, and afford a noble Harbour for Ships at the Mouth of it; when, on a &s;udden, the Land ri&s;ing high by the Sea-&s;ide, cro&s;&s;es the Head of the River, like a Dam, checks the whole Cour&s;e of it, and it returns, bending its Cour&s;e We&s;t, for two Miles, or thereabouts; and then turning North, thro' another long Cour&s;e of Mea|dows, (joining to tho&s;e ju&s;t now mentioned) &s;eeks out the River <HI>Yare,</HI> joins its Water with hers, and both find their Way to the Sea together.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="63">Some of our Hi&s;torians tell a long fabulous Story of this River's being once open, and a famous Har|bour for Ships belonging to the Town of <HI>Leo&s;tof</HI> adjoining; but that <HI>Yarmouth</HI> envying the Pro&s;pe|rity of <HI>Leo&s;tof,</HI> made War upon them; and that after many bloody Battles, as well by Sea as by Land, they came at la&s;t to a deci&s;ive Action at Sea with their re&s;pective Fleets; but the <HI>Leo&s;tof</HI> Fleet being overthrown, and utterly de&s;troyed, the <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Men either actually &s;topped up the Mouth of the &s;aid River, or obliged the vanqui&s;hed <HI>Leo&s;tof</HI> Men to do it them&s;elves, and bound them never to attempt to open it again.</P>
<P>I &s;ee no Authority for this Relation, neither do the Relators agree either in the Time or in the Par|ticulars of the Fact.</P>
<P>In this va&s;t Tract of Meadows are fed a prodigious Number of Black Cattle, which are &s;aid to produce the fatte&s;t Beef, tho' not the large&s;t, in <HI>England</HI>; and the Quantity is &s;o great, as that they not only &s;upply the City of <HI>Norwich,</HI> the Town of <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> and the County adjacent, but &s;end great Quantities of them weekly, in all the Winter Sea&s;on, to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>And this in particular is worthy Remark, That the gro&s;s of all the <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle, which come yearly into <HI>England,</HI> are brought to a &s;mall Village lying North of the City of <HI>Norwich,</HI> called St. <HI>Faith</HI>'s, where the <HI>Norfolk</HI> Gra&s;iers go and buy them.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Scots</HI> Runts, as they call them, coming out of the cold and barren Mountains of the Highlands in <HI>Scotland,</HI> feed &s;o eagerly on the rich Pa&s;ture in the&s;e Mar&s;hes, that they thrive in an unu&s;ual man|ner, and grow very fat; and the Beef is &s;o delicious for Ta&s;te, that the Inhabitants prefer them to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cattle, which are much larger and fairer to look at. Some have told me, and I believe with Truth, that there are above 40,000 of the&s;e <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle fed in this County every Year, and mo&s;t of
<PB N="57" REF="64">
them in the Mar&s;hes between <HI>Norwich, Beccles,</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yarmouth</HI> is an antient Town, much older than <HI>Norwich</HI>; and tho' not extending over &s;o much Ground, yet better built, and more complete, and not much inferior in Number of Inhabitants; and for Wealth, Traffick, and Advantage of its Situation, infinitely &s;uperior to <HI>Norwich.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;ituated on a Penin&s;ula between the River <HI>Yare</HI> and the Sea; the two la&s;t lying parallel to one another, and the Town in the Middle: The River lies on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Town, and being grown very large and deep, by the Receiving of all the Rivers on this &s;ide the County, forms the Haven: and the Town facing to the We&s;t al&s;o, and open to the River, makes the fine&s;t Quay in <HI>England,</HI> if not in <HI>Europe,</HI> at lea&s;t equalling that of <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Ships ride here &s;o clo&s;e, as it were, keeping up one another, with their Head-fa&s;ts on Shore, that for half a Mile together, they go cro&s;s the Stream with their Bolt&s;prits over the Land, their Bows or Heads touching the very Wharf; &s;o that one may walk from Ship to Ship as on a floating Bridge, all along by the Shore-&s;ide. The Quay reaching from the Draw-bridge almo&s;t to the South-gate, is &s;o &s;pacious and wide, that in &s;ome Places 'tis near 100 Yards from the Hou&s;es to the Wharf. In this plea&s;ant and agreeable Range of Hou&s;es are &s;ome very magnificent Buildings, and, among the re&s;t, the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and Town-hall, and &s;ome Merchants Hou&s;es, which look like little Palaces, rather than the Dwelling-hou&s;es of private Men.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Defect of this beautiful Town &s;eems to be, that tho' it is very rich, and increa&s;ing in Wealth and Trade, and con&s;equently in People, there is not Room to inlarge it by new Buildings; being precluded on the We&s;t and South-&s;ides by the River, and on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide by the Sea, &s;o that there
<PB N="58" REF="65">
is no Room but on the North-end without the Gate; and there the Land is not very agreeable: but had they had a larger Space within the Gates, there would before now, have been many &s;pacious Streets of Buildings erected, as we &s;ee is done in &s;ome other thriving Towns in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>During the Fi&s;hing-fair, as they call it, one &s;ees the Land covered with People, and the River with Barks and Boats, bu&s;y Day and Night, landing and carrying off the Herrings, which they catch here in almo&s;t incredible Quantities. I happened to be there during their Fi&s;hing-fair, when I told, in one Tide, One hundred and ten Barks and fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els coming up the River, all loaden with Her|rings, taken the Night before; and this, over and above what was brought on Shore on the Dean (that is the Sea-&s;ide of the Town) by open Boats, which they call <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Cobles</HI> are open Boats, which come from the North, from <HI>Scarbro', Whitby,</HI> &amp;c. and come to <HI>Yarmouth</HI> to let them&s;elves out to fi&s;h for the Merchants during the Fair-time.</NOTE><HI>Cobles,</HI> and which often bring in two or three <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A La&s;t is ten Barrels, each Barrel containing a thou&s;and Herrings.</NOTE>La&s;ts of Fi&s;h at a Time. The <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The Barks come from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> as from <HI>Folk&s;ton, Dover,</HI> and <HI>Rye</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and from <HI>Brighthelm&s;ton</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and let them&s;elves out to fi&s;h for the Merchants during the &s;aid Fair, as the <HI>Cobles</HI> do from the North.</NOTE>Barks often bring ten La&s;ts apiece.</P>
<P>This Fi&s;hing-fair began on <HI>Michaelmas-day,</HI> and la&s;ts all the Month of <HI>October,</HI> by which time the Herrings draw off to Sea, &s;hoot their Spawn, and are no more fit for the Merchants Bu&s;ine&s;s; at lea&s;t not tho&s;e that are taken hereabouts.</P>
<P>We have very different Accounts of the Quantity of Herrings caught here, in this Sea&s;on; &s;ome have &s;aid, that the Towns of <HI>Yarmouth</HI> and <HI>Leo&s;toff</HI> only, have taken 40,000 La&s;ts in a Sea&s;on: I will not venture to confirm that Report; but I have heard
<PB N="59" REF="66">
the Merchants them&s;elves &s;ay, that they have cured 40,000 Barrels of merchantable red Herrings in one Sea&s;on, which (tho' far &s;hort of the other) is a very con&s;iderable Article; and it is to be added, that the&s;e are over and above all the Herrings con&s;umed in the Country Towns of both tho&s;e populous Counties, for 30 Miles from the Sea, whither very great Quantities are carried every Tide during the whole Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>But this is only one Branch of the great Trade carried on in this Town; another Part of its Com|merce is in the exporting the&s;e Herrings after they are cured; and for this its Merchants have a great Trade to <HI>Genoa, Leghorn, Naples, Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> as al&s;o to <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI>; exporting likewi&s;e with their Herrings great Quantities of Wor&s;ted Stuffs, and Stuffs made of Silk and Wor&s;ted; Cam|blets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Manufactures of the neighbouring City of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and of the Places adjacent.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, they carry on a very con&s;iderable Trade with <HI>Holland,</HI> exporting a va&s;t Quantity of Woollen Manufactures every Year. Al&s;o they have a Fi&s;hing-trade to the North Seas for white Fi&s;h, which from the Place are called the North Sea Cod.</P>
<P>They have likewi&s;e a con&s;iderable Trade to <HI>Nor|way,</HI> and to the <HI>Baltick,</HI> from whence they bring back Deals, and Fir Timber, Oaken Plank, Baulks, Spars, Oars, Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax, Canvas, and Sail-cloth; with all manner of Naval Stores, for which they generally have a Con&s;umption in their own Port, where they build a very great Number of Ships every Year, be&s;ides refitting and repairing the old.</P>
<P>Add to this the Coal-trade between <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> and the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> in which they are &s;o improved of late Years, that they have now a greater Share of it than any other Town in <HI>England</HI>; and have quite worked the <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> Men out of it, who had
<PB N="60" REF="67">
formerly the chief Share of the Colliery in their Hands.</P>
<P>For the carrying on all the&s;e Trades, they have a very great Number of Ships, either of their own, or employed by them; and it may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be judged of by this, That in the Year 1697. I had an Account from the Town Regi&s;ter, that there were then 1123 Sail of Ships u&s;ing the Sea, belonging to the Town, be&s;ides &s;uch Ships as the Merchants of <HI>Yarmouth</HI> might be concerned in, and be Part-owners of, belonging to any other Ports.</P>
<P>To all this I mu&s;t add, without Compliment to the Town, that the Merchants, and even the gene|rality of Traders of <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> have a very good Reputation in Trade, as well Abroad as at Home, for fair and honourable Dealing; and their Seamen, as well Ma&s;ters as Mariners, are ju&s;tly e&s;teemed among the able&s;t and mo&s;t expert Navigators in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This Town, however populous and large, had till lately but one Pari&s;h-church, dedicated to St. <HI>Nicolas,</HI> tho' it is very large. It has a high Spire, which is an u&s;eful Sea-mark. It was built by that famous Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich, William Herbert,</HI> who flouri&s;hed in the Reign of <HI>William</HI> II. and <HI>Henry</HI> I. <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malm&s;bury</HI> calls him <HI>Vir pecunio&s;us,</HI> from the Works of Charity and Munificence, which he has left as Witne&s;&s;es of his immen&s;e Riches; for he built the Cathedral Church, the Priory for 60 Monks, the Bi&s;hop's Palace, and the Pari&s;h-church of St. <HI>Leonard,</HI> all in <HI>Norwich</HI>; this great Church at <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> the Church of St. <HI>Margaret</HI> at <HI>Lynn,</HI> and of St. <HI>Mary</HI> at <HI>Elmham.</HI> He removed the Epi&s;copal See from <HI>Thetford</HI> to <HI>Norwich,</HI> and in&s;ti|tuted the <HI>Cluniack</HI> Monks at <HI>Thetford,</HI> and gave them, or built them, a Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But in the Reigns of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> and the late King <HI>George</HI> I. two Acts pa&s;&s;ed for Building a new
<PB N="61" REF="68">
Church or Chapel of Ea&s;e in <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> and for enlightening the Streets of the Town, and other Purpo&s;es, all which is performed in &s;o complete a manner as is worthy of the Place.</P>
<P>Al&s;o in the Year 1723. an Act pa&s;&s;ed for Clearing, Depthening, Repairing, Extending, Maintaining and Improving the Haven and Piers of <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> and for depthening and making more navigable the &s;everal Rivers emptying them&s;elves at that Town; and al&s;o for pre&s;erving of Ships wintering in the Haven from Accidents by Fire: This Provi&s;ion was a very ne|ce&s;&s;ary one; for the Haven is &s;o very commodious for the &s;ecure and &s;afe lying of Ships in the Winter Sea&s;on, that &s;everal hundred Sail are yearly laid up and winter in it, which lie &s;o contiguous to one an|other, and &s;o near the Hou&s;es, that in ca&s;e of Fire, not only the Ships, but the Town, would be in Danger of being totally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Here is one of the fine&s;t Market-places, and the be&s;t &s;erved with Provi&s;ions in <HI>England, London</HI> ex|cepted. The Streets are all exactly &s;trait from North to South, from Lanes or Alleys, which they call <HI>Rows,</HI> cro&s;&s;ing them in &s;trait Lines al&s;o from Ea&s;t to We&s;t; &s;o that it is the mo&s;t regular-built Town in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;eems as if it had been erected all at once upon one uniform Plan.</P>
<P>They have particular Privileges in this Town, and a Juri&s;diction by which they can try, condemn, and execute in e&s;pecial Ca&s;es, without waiting for a Warrant from Above; and this they exerted once very &s;martly, in executing a Captain of one of the King's Ships of War in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. for a Murder committed in the Street; the Cir|cum&s;tance of which did indeed call for Ju&s;tice: but &s;ome thought they would not have ventured to exert their Power as they did; however, I never heard that the Government re&s;ented it, or blamed them for it.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="69">It is a very well governed Town; and I have no|where in <HI>England</HI> ob&s;erved the <HI>Sabbath-day</HI> &s;o exactly kept, or the Breach of it &s;o con&s;tantly puni&s;hed, as in this Place, which I mention to their Honour.</P>
<P>From <HI>Yarmouth</HI> I re&s;olved to pur&s;ue my fir&s;t De|&s;ign, <HI>viz.</HI> To view the Sea-&s;ide on this Coa&s;t, which is particularly noted for being one of the mo&s;t dan|gerous and mo&s;t fatal to the Sailors in all <HI>Britain</HI>; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e of the great Number of Ships which are continually going and coming this Way, in their Pa&s;&s;age between <HI>London</HI> and all the Northern Coa&s;ts of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of which is, that the Shore from the Mouth of the River of <HI>Thames</HI> to <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Road, lies in a &s;trait Line from South-&s;outh-ea&s;t to North-north-we&s;t, the Land being on the We&s;t or Larboard Side. From <HI>Wintertonne&s;s,</HI> which is the utmo&s;t ea&s;terly Point of Land in the County of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and about four Miles beyond <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> the Shore falls off for near 60 Miles to the We&s;t, as far as <HI>Lynn</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> till the Shore of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> tends North again for about 60 Miles more, as far as the <HI>Humber</HI>; whence the Coa&s;t of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> or <HI>Holderne&s;s,</HI> which is the Ea&s;t-Riding, &s;hoots out again into the Sea, to the <HI>Spurn,</HI> and to <HI>Flambro' Head,</HI> as far Ea&s;t almo&s;t as the Shore of <HI>Norfolk</HI> had given back at <HI>Winterton,</HI> making a very deep Gulph, or Bay, between tho&s;e two Points of <HI>Winterton</HI> and the <HI>Spurn Head</HI>; &s;o that the Ships going North are obliged to &s;tretch away to Sea from <HI>Wintertonne&s;s</HI>; and leaving the Sight of Land in the deep Bay I have mentioned, that reaches to <HI>Lynn,</HI> and the Shore of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> they go, as I ob&s;erved, North or &s;till North-north-we&s;t, to meet the Shore of <HI>Holderne&s;s,</HI> which, as I &s;aid, runs out into the Sea again at the <HI>Spurn</HI>; this they leave al&s;o, and the fir&s;t Land they make, is called as above, <HI>Flambro' Head</HI>; &s;o that <HI>Wintertonne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Flam|bro' Head</HI> are the two Extremes of this Cour&s;e.
<PB N="63" REF="70">
There is, indeed, the <HI>Spurn Head</HI> between; but as it lies too far in towards the <HI>Humber,</HI> they keep out to the North to avoid coming near it.</P>
<P>In like manner the Ships which come from the North, leave the Shore at <HI>Flambro' Head,</HI> and &s;tretch away South-&s;outh-ea&s;t for <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Roads; and the fir&s;t Land they make is <HI>Wintertonne&s;s,</HI> as above. Now, the Danger of the Place is this: If the Ships coming from the North are taken with a hard Gale of Wind from the South-ea&s;t, or from any Point between North-ea&s;t and South-ea&s;t, &s;o that they cannot weather <HI>Wintertonne&s;s,</HI> they are thereby kept within that deep Bay; and if the Wind blows hard, are often in Danger of running on Shore upon the Rocks about <HI>Cromere,</HI> on the North-coa&s;t of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> or &s;tranding upon the flat Shore between <HI>Cromere</HI> and <HI>Wells.</HI> All the Relief they have, is good Ground-tackle to ride it out, which is very hard to do there, the Sea coming very high upon them; or if they cannot ride it out, then to run into the Bot|tom of the great Bay, to <HI>Lynn</HI> or <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which is a very difficult and de&s;perate Pu&s;h: &s;o that &s;ometimes in this Di&s;tre&s;s whole Fleets have been lo&s;t here all together.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Danger are Ships going Northward; for if, after pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Winterton,</HI> they are taken &s;hort with a North-ea&s;t Wind, and cannot put back into the Roads, which very often happens, they are driven upon the &s;ame Coa&s;t, and embay'd ju&s;t as the latter. The Danger on the North-part of this Bay is not the &s;ame, becau&s;e if Ships going or coming &s;hould be taken &s;hort on this &s;ide <HI>Flambro',</HI> there is the River <HI>Humber</HI> open to them, and &s;everal good Roads to have recour&s;e to; as <HI>Burlington</HI> Bay, <HI>Grim&s;by</HI> Road, the <HI>Spurn</HI> Head, and others, where they ride under Shelter.</P>
<P>The Dangers of this Place being thus con&s;idered, 'tis no wonder, that upon the Shore beyond <HI>Yar|mouth,</HI>

there are no le&s;s than Four Light-hou&s;es kept flaming every Night, be&s;ides the Lights at <HI>Ca&s;tor,</HI> North of the Town, and at <HI>Goul&s;ton,</HI> South. All which are to direct the Sailors to keep a good Offing, in ca&s;e of bad Weather, and to prevent their running into <HI>Cromere-bay,</HI> which the Seamen call the <HI>Devil's Throat.</HI></P>
<P>As I went by Land from <HI>Yarmouth</HI> North-we&s;t, along the Shore towards <HI>Cromere</HI> afore&s;aid, and was not then fully Ma&s;ter of the Rea&s;on of the&s;e things, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee, in all the Way from <HI>Winterton,</HI> that the Farmers, and Country People had &s;carce a Barn, Shed, Stable, or Pales to their Yards and Gardens, or a Hog-&s;tye, or Nece&s;&s;ary-hou&s;e, but what was built of old Planks, Beams, Wales and Timber, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the deplorable Wrecks of Ships, and Ruins of Mariners and Merchants Fortunes; and in &s;ome Places were whole Yards filled, and piled up very high, with the &s;ame Stuff laid up for the like building Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>About the Year 1692. there was a melancholy Example of what I have &s;aid of this Place: A Fleet of 200 Sail of light Colliers went out of <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Roads with a fair Wind, to pur&s;ue their Voyage, and were taken &s;hort with a Storm of Wind at North-ea&s;t. After they were pa&s;t <HI>Wintertonne&s;s,</HI> a few Leagues, &s;ome of them, who&s;e Ma&s;ters made a better Judgment of Things, or who were not &s;o far out as the re&s;t, tacked and put back in time, and got &s;afe into the Roads; but the re&s;t, pu&s;hing on, in hopes to keep out to Sea, and weather it, were by the Violence of the Storm driven back, when they were too far embay'd to weather <HI>Wintertonne&s;s,</HI> a above; and &s;o were forced to run We&s;t, every one &s;hifting for them&s;elves, as well as they could; &s;ome run away for <HI>Lynn Deeps,</HI> but few of them (the Night being &s;o dark) could find their Way thither; &s;ome, but very few, rid it out, at a Di&s;tance; the
<PB N="65" REF="72">
re&s;t, being above 140 Sail, were all driven on Shore, and da&s;hed to Pieces, and very few of the People on Board were &s;aved. At the very &s;ame unhappy Juncture, a Fleet of loaden Ships were coming from the North, and being ju&s;t cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ame Bay, were forcibly driven into it, not able to weather the <HI>Ne&s;s,</HI> and &s;o were involved in the &s;ame Ruin as the light Fleet was; al&s;o &s;ome coa&s;ting Ve&s;&s;els loaden with Corn from <HI>Lynn</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> and bound for <HI>Holland,</HI> were with the &s;ame unhappy Luck ju&s;t come out, to begin their Voyage, and &s;ome of them lay at Anchor: the&s;e al&s;o met with the &s;ame Mi&s;|fortune, &s;o that in the whole, above 200 Sail of Ships, and above 1000 People, were lo&s;t in the Di&s;a&s;ter of that one mi&s;erable Night, very few e&s;caping.</P>
<P><HI>Cromere</HI> is a Market-town clo&s;e to the Shore of this dangerous Coa&s;t: I know nothing it is famous for (be&s;ides its being thus the Terror of the Sailors) except good Lob&s;ters, which are taken on that Coa&s;t in great Numbers, and carried to <HI>Norwich,</HI> and in &s;uch Quantities &s;ometimes too, as to be conveyed by Sea to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Farther within the Land, and between this Place and <HI>Norwich,</HI> are &s;everal good Market-towns, and a great many Villages, all diligently applying to the Woollen Manufacture, and the Country is exceeding fertile, as well in Corn as Pa&s;ture; particularly, (which was very plea&s;ant to &s;ee) the Phea&s;ants were in &s;uch great Plenty, as to be &s;een in the Stubble like Cocks and Hens; a Te&s;timony tho' (by the way) that the County had more Trade&s;men than Gentle|men in it. Indeed this Part is &s;o intirely given up to Indu&s;try, that what with the Seafaring-men on the one Side, and the Manufactures on the other, we &s;aw no idle Hands here, but every Man bu&s;y.

rendered more difficult than it was; tho' far from &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P><HI>The Seven Burnhams,</HI> which are &s;o many &s;mall Towns called by the &s;ame Name, and each employed in the &s;ame <HI>Holland</HI> Trade as <HI>Marham</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> lie on and near the Sea-coa&s;t to the North-we&s;t of <HI>Wal&s;ingham.</HI></P>
<P>From the Sea-coa&s;t we turned to the South-we&s;t, thro' <HI>Snetham,</HI> a &s;mall Market-town, to <HI>Ca&s;tle-Ri&s;ing,</HI> an old decayed Borough Town, with hardly Ten Families in it, which yet &s;ends Two Members to Parliament; but &s;hews a great many Marks of <HI>Roman, Saxon,</HI> and <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Antiquities in and about it.</P>
<P>On our Left we &s;aw <HI>Wal&s;ingham,</HI> an antient Town, famous for the old Ruins of a Mona&s;tery there, and the Shrine of our Lady, as noted as that of St. <HI>Thomas-a-Becket</HI> at <HI>Canterbury</HI>; hence called, <HI>Our Lady of Wal&s;ingham.</HI> Two Wells here are &s;till called by the Name of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin.</HI></P>
<P>Near this Place, at <HI>Raynham,</HI> is the Seat of the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Town&s;hend</HI>; and not far di&s;tant, at <HI>Houghton,</HI> that noble new-built one of Sir <HI>Robert Walpole</HI>; the Gardens and Plantations of which are very large and beautiful.</P>
<P>The general Plan and Front of the Hou&s;e and Offices extend to 450 Feet; the great Hall is a Circle of 40 Feet; the Salon 40 by 30 Feet; and all the other Rooms in the four great Apartments are 18 Feet high; the Attick Story is 12 Feet high, and the Ru&s;tick Story the &s;ame, all above Ground, under which is an intire Story of Cellars all arched. The Front to the great Entrance extends to 166 Feet, lying open to the Park. The Building is fini&s;hed with two Towers, dre&s;&s;ed with two Ru&s;tick <HI>Venetian</HI> Windows.

to excu&s;e any &s;eeming or real Defect, it may be truly &s;aid to be a Hou&s;e of State and Conveniency worthy of a Prince's Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>This &s;tately Structure, begun in the Year 1722. was completely fini&s;hed, In&s;ide and Out&s;ide, in the Year 1735. the noble Founder having had the &s;ingular Felicity all the time to continue at the Helm of Affairs, as he does &s;till, <HI>Anno</HI> 1741.</P>
<P>On the Foundation-&s;tone, placed in the South-ea&s;t Angle, is this In&s;cription:<Q><HI>Hic me po&s;uit</HI> <LB>ROBERTUS <HI>ille</HI> WALPOLE, <LB><HI>Quem tu non ne&s;cies, Po&s;teritas;</HI> <LB><HI>Fandamen ut e&s;&s;em Demus</HI> <LB><HI>In Agro Natali extruendae,</HI> <LB>24^o <HI>die Maii, A.

God grant, that after its Ma&s;ter, to a ma|ture Old Age, &s;hall have long enjoy'd it in Perfection, his late&s;t De&s;cendants may &s;afely and &s;e|curely po&s;&s;e&s;s it to the End of Time.</Q></P>
<P>The noble Founder had doubtle&s;s in his Thoughts, in this In&s;cription, the uncertain State of Prime Mi|ni&s;ters, and of the &s;uperb Structures built by them in the Height of their Power in all Ages and Countries; and we hope the Merits of him and his De&s;cendants to their native Country may induce the Almighty to give a <HI>Fiat</HI> to his Prayer.</P>
<P>We proceeded hence to <HI>Lynn,</HI> another rich and populous Port-town, well built, and well &s;ituated, at the Mouth of the River <HI>Ou&s;e</HI>; which has the greate&s;t Extent of inland Navigation, of any Port in <HI>England, London</HI> excepted. The Rea&s;on where|of is, that more navigable Rivers empty them|&s;elves here into the Sea, including the Wa&s;hes,
<PB N="69" REF="76">
which are Branches of the &s;ame Port, than at any one Mouth of Waters in <HI>England,</HI> except the <HI>Thames</HI> and the <HI>Humber.</HI> By the&s;e navigable Rivers the Merchants of <HI>Lynn</HI> &s;upply about &s;ix Counties wholly, and three Counties in Part, with their Goods, e&s;pecially Wine and Coals; <HI>viz.</HI> By the little <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> they &s;end their Goods to <HI>Brandon</HI> and <HI>Thetford</HI>; by the Lake, to <HI>Mildenhall, Barton-Mills,</HI> and <HI>St. Edmund&s;bury</HI>; by the River <HI>Grant</HI> to <HI>Cambridge</HI>; by the great <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> it&s;elf, to <HI>Ely,</HI> to <HI>St. Ives,</HI> to St. <HI>Neots,</HI> to <HI>Barford-bridge,</HI> and to <HI>Bed|ford</HI>; by the River <HI>Nyne,</HI> to <HI>Peterboro</HI>'; by the Drains and Wa&s;hes to <HI>Wi&s;bich,</HI> to <HI>Spalding, Market-deeping,</HI> and <HI>Stamford</HI>; be&s;ides the &s;everal Counties, into which the&s;e Goods are carried by Land Carriage, from the Places where the Navigation of tho&s;e Rivers ends; which has given Ri&s;e to this Ob&s;erva|tion on the Town of <HI>Lynn,</HI> That they bring in more Coals, than any Sea-port between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and import more Wines than any Port in <HI>England,</HI> except <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>; their Trade to <HI>Norway,</HI> and to the <HI>Baltick Sea,</HI> is al&s;o great in Proportion, and of late Years they have extended it farther to the Southward.</P>
<P>There are many Gentry, and con&s;equently more Gayety, in this Town than in <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> or even <HI>Norwich,</HI> the Place abounding in very good Com|pany; and indeed it is &s;o con&s;iderable, that it merits as particular a De&s;cription as the Nature of this Work will admit; and which, therefore, I will give as &s;uccinctly as I can.</P>
<P>To begin then: This Town was fir&s;t called <HI>Lynn-Epi&s;copi,</HI> as the Property of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> till the Di&s;&s;olution of Mona&s;teries by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. when that Prince, becoming its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, conferred on it the Name of <HI>Lynn Regis.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="77">It is &s;ituated towards the Mouth of the <HI>Great Ou&s;e,</HI> encompa&s;&s;ed with a deep Trench, walled almo&s;t all round, containing about 2400 Hou&s;es, and divided by four Rivulets arched over with about 15 Bridges. It extends along the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the River; which in high Spring-tides flows above 20 Feet perpendi|cular, and is about the Breadth of the <HI>Thames</HI> above Bridge, for the Length of a Mile, and is divided into nine Wards. On the North-end, towards the Sea, &s;tands <HI>St. Anne's Fort,</HI> with a Platform of 12 large Guns, commanding all Ships which pa&s;s by the Harbour; and towards the Land, be&s;ides the Wall, there are nine regular Ba&s;tions and a Ditch, nearly in the Form of a Semicircle, which make it above half a Mile in Breadth. The Town is &s;o antient as to be &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;ame with <HI>Maiden-Bower,</HI> ac|cording to &s;everal old Hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>It has many remarkable Places, which de&s;erve a more particular De&s;cription than I have Room for: however, I &s;hall touch upon them briefly; as, <HI>St. Margaret</HI>'s Church, the <HI>Town-hall, Bridewell,</HI> the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>Exchange,</HI> the <HI>Market-cro&s;s, St. Nicolas</HI>'s Chapel, <HI>All-Saints</HI> Church, the <HI>Free-School,</HI> the <HI>Ho&s;pitals,</HI> the Statue of King <HI>James</HI> II. King <HI>John</HI>'s Sword and Cup, the common <HI>Stath-yard,</HI> the <HI>Lady's Mount,</HI> the publick Libraries, the King's <HI>Stath-yard,</HI> and other Remarkables, of which in their Order; and fir&s;t of <HI>St. Margarets</HI> Church.</P>
<P>This Church, which was formerly an Abbey, and is one of the large&s;t Parochial Churches in <HI>England,</HI> is adorned with a very fair and high Lanthorn, covered with Lead, containing the Clock-bell, lately ca&s;t, which may be heard all over the Town. Its Height is 132 Feet. At the We&s;t-end &s;tands a Stone Tower, 82 Feet high; and facing the Street a Moon-dial, de&s;igned to tell the Increa&s;e and Decrea&s;e of that Planet, with the exact Hour of the Day&punc; It moves by Clock-work. Over the Tower is a
<PB N="71" REF="78">
Spire 193 Feet high in form of a Pyramid; near to which is the Bell-tower built of Free-&s;tone, 86 Feet high, containing a Ring of eight Bells. In this Church is kept the Bi&s;hop's Court, when he comes hither on his Vi&s;itation.</P>
<P>The Town-hou&s;e, called <HI>Trinity-hall,</HI> is an antient and noble Building, which makes a fine Appearance.</P>
<P>Adjoining to it is the Hou&s;e of Correction called <HI>Bridewell,</HI> with Apartments proper for the Reception of &s;uch as are put there; who beat and dre&s;s Hemp during their Confinement.</P>
<P>The <HI>Exchange</HI> is a fair Structure of Free-&s;tone, with two Orders of Columns, &s;ituated in the Middle of the Town, and built at the Expence of Sir <HI>John Turner,</HI> Knight; and within it is the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,</HI> containing &s;everal commodious Apartments.</P>
<P>The <HI>Market-hou&s;e</HI> is a new Edifice of Free-&s;tone, in the modern Ta&s;te, 70 Feet high, erected on four Steps, neatly adorned with Statues, and other Em|belli&s;hments; with an In&s;cription giving an Account of its former Condition, and pre&s;ent Rebuilding.</P>
<P><HI>St. Nicolas</HI>'s Chapel is very antient, and &s;tands at the North-end of the Town. It is an Appendage to <HI>St. Margaret</HI>'s, and is e&s;teemed one of the faire&s;t and large&s;t religious Fabricks in <HI>England</HI>; it has a Bell-tower of Free-&s;tone, and a pyramidical octan|gular Spire over it, both which together are 170 Feet from the Ground.</P>
<P><HI>All-Saints</HI> Church, in <HI>South-Lynn,</HI> belonged for|merly to the <HI>Carmelite</HI> and <HI>White</HI> Friers, on the Ruins of who&s;e Mona&s;tery it is built. Tho' not large, it is neat, &s;olid and regular, in form of a Cro&s;s, within a Church-yard well walled in.</P>
<P>On the North-&s;ide of <HI>St. Margaret</HI>'s Church-yard is the <HI>Free-&s;chool,</HI> a &s;trong and beautiful Building.</P>
<P>The only Fabrick formerly belonging to any re|ligious Order, now &s;tanding, is the <HI>Grey-Fryers</HI> Steeple, a noted Sea-mark; which was repaired and
<PB N="72" REF="79">
amended out of the Ruins of a demoli&s;hed Chapel in the Year 1539. It may not be ami&s;s to mention here a remarkable and laudable Order, that was made in the Year 1588. That on every fir&s;t <HI>Monday</HI> in the Month there &s;hould be a Meeting of the Mayor, Aldermen, &s;ome of the Common-Council, and the Preachers, in order to &s;ettle Peace and Quietne&s;s be|tween Man and Man, and to decide all manner of Controver&s;ies: this was called <HI>The Fea&s;t of Recon|ciliation.</HI></P>
<P>In the Pari&s;h of <HI>All-Saints</HI> is a &s;mall <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> for four poor Men to live rent-free. <HI>St. Mary Magdalen</HI>'s <HI>Ho&s;pital,</HI> founded in the Reign of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> for a Prior, and 12 Brethren and Si&s;ters, continued in a flouri&s;hing Condition about 400 Years; and devolved to the Crown at the making the Statute for Di&s;&s;olution of religious Hou&s;es in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. in who&s;e Time it was robbed, and almo&s;t levelled with the Ground, by <HI>Kett</HI>'s Mutineers, at their Return from their fru&s;trated At|tempt to &s;urpri&s;e <HI>Lynn:</HI> &s;o that it remained de&s;titute of Brethren and Si&s;ters, except &s;ome poor People, whom the Mayor and Burge&s;&s;es maintained with De&s;ign to &s;upport the antient Ho&s;pital, till King <HI>James</HI> I. upon Petition re&s;tored them their Lands, granted them many Privileges, and incorporated them: but in the Year 1643. it was a &s;econd time de&s;troy'd by Fire by the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>'s Forces, when they be&s;ieged <HI>Lynn,</HI> then &s;tanding out for the King. In the Year 1649. the Corportation rebuilt it very commodiou&s;ly, as at pre&s;ent, with two Courts, a Chapel, and convenient Apartments for the Ma&s;ter, Brethren, and Si&s;ters, and &s;everal In&s;criptions com|memorating the late Di&s;a&s;ter. It is now committed to the Care of Two of the Elder Aldermen, cho&s;en for that Purpo&s;e by the other Governors.</P>
<P>There is in the great Market-place a Statue erected in the Year 1686. to the Honour of King <HI>James</HI> II.
<PB N="73" REF="80">
with an In&s;cription that may &s;erve for a Satire on the undue Compliments which are frequently paid to Princes, during the Time of their Pro&s;perity.

<P>In 1682. an old ruinous Building, which was once a Chapel, was, by the Corporation, and other In|habitants, made a publick Receptacle for poor Chil|dren to learn to &s;pin Wooll: here they are al&s;o taught to read.

<P><PB N="75" REF="82">From what has been &s;aid, it will be ob&s;erved, that the Situation of this Town renders it capable of being made very &s;trong; and in the late Wars it was &s;o, a Line of Fortification being drawn round it at a Di&s;tance from the Walls; the Ruins, or rather Remains of which Works appear to this Day; nor would it be a hard Matter to re&s;tore the Ba&s;tions, with the Ravelins and Counter&s;carp, upon any &s;ud|den Emergency, to a good State of Defence; e&s;pe|cially becau&s;e they are able to fill all their Ditches with Water from the Sea, in &s;uch a manner as that it cannot be drawn off.</P>
<P>They pa&s;s over here in Boats into the Fen Coun|try, and over the famous Wa&s;hes into <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI>; but the Pa&s;&s;age is very dangerous and unea&s;y; for here Pa&s;&s;engers often mi&s;carry, and are lo&s;t; but then it is u&s;ually on their venturing at improper times, and without the Guides, which if they would be per&s;uaded not to do, they would very rarely fail of going or coming &s;afe.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lynn,</HI> I bent my Cour&s;e Southward to <HI>Downham,</HI> where is an ugly wooden Bridge over the <HI>Ou&s;e</HI>; at which, as <HI>Holling&s;head</HI> informs us, in <HI>October</HI> 1568. were taken 17 mon&s;trous Fi&s;hes, from 20 to 27 Feet long.</P>
<P>When we were at <HI>Downham,</HI> we took a Turn to the antient Town of <HI>Thetford,</HI> &s;ituated partly in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and partly in <HI>Suffolk.</HI> It was rai&s;ed on the Ruins of the antient <HI>Sitomagus,</HI> which was de&s;troy'd by the <HI>Danes.</HI> It is at pre&s;ent but meanly built; but by the Ruins of Churches and Mona&s;teries &s;till remaining, appears to have been formerly of great Account; and even &s;o far back as the Time of King <HI>Edward the Confe&s;&s;or,</HI> it had 947 Burge&s;&s;es, and in that of <HI>William the Conqueror</HI> 720 Man&s;ions. On the <HI>Suffolk</HI> Side there now remain the Ruins of &s;ix Churches and Mona&s;teries, and there were &s;everal others in the Town; but now there are but three
<PB N="76" REF="83">
Pari&s;h Churches &s;tanding intire, one on the <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and two on the <HI>Norfolk</HI> Side. It is, however, a Town Corporate, governed by a Mayor, Aldermen and Common-council; has three annual Fairs, a plentiful weekly Market, and is a kind of See &s;uffragan to that of <HI>Norwich.</HI> In the 7th Year of King <HI>James</HI> I. an Act pa&s;&s;ed for the Founding of an Ho&s;pital, a Grammar-&s;chool, and Maintenance of a Preacher in this Town for ever, according to the la&s;t Will of Sir <HI>Richard Fulmar&s;ton:</HI> And Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph William&s;on,</HI> Secretary of State to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. built here a new Council-hou&s;e, and was otherwi&s;e a good Benefactor to the Place. The <HI>Lent</HI> A&s;&s;izes are u&s;ually held here.</P>
<P>From <HI>Thetford</HI> we cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> to <HI>Brandon,</HI> which gives the Title of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Duke to Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> of <HI>Scotland.</HI> This is no ill-built Town, and has a good Church belonging to it. It gave a Lord Mayor to <HI>London, Anno</HI> 1445; <HI>viz.</HI> Sir <HI>Simon Eyre,</HI> Draper, who built <HI>Leadenhall</HI> for the U&s;e of the City, and left 5000 Marks, a very great Sum in tho&s;e Days, to charitable U&s;es. <HI>Brandon</HI> has lo&s;t its Market, but &s;tands conveniently upon the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> over which it has a Bridge, and a Ferry, to convey Goods to and from the I&s;le of <HI>Ely,</HI> to which we directly bent our Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>We made an Excur&s;ion from <HI>Ely</HI> Northwards up to the <HI>Fens</HI>; but we &s;aw nothing that Way worth our Curio&s;ity, or remarking, but deep Roads, va&s;t Drains and Dykes of Water, which are all navigable; but with all this, a very rich Soil, bearing a great Quantity of Hemp, but a bad unwhol&s;ome Air.</P>
<P><HI>Wi&s;bich,</HI> however, which lies on the Northern Extremity of the County, has not only been of Note in the Conqueror's Time, who built a Ca&s;tle here; but is now a well-built Market-town, has a good Town-hall, and is e&s;teemed the be&s;t Trading-town in the I&s;le, as having the Convenience of good
<PB N="77" REF="84">
Water-carriage to <HI>London,</HI> whither they &s;end great Quantities of Oil and Butter, and bring back all &s;orts of Commodities, with which the whole I&s;le is furni&s;hed; for it has a plentiful Market.</P>
<P>A good way lower down, to the South, are the two Market-towns of <HI>Mer&s;h</HI> and <HI>Thorney</HI>; the fir&s;t is very incon&s;iderable, the other is delightfully &s;itu|ated; and the Land about it very fruitful in Gra&s;s and Trees.</P>
<P>The <HI>I&s;le of Ely</HI> is encompa&s;&s;ed with the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> and other Waters. The City is &s;ituated on a Hill, in the Middle of a great Plain. It is full of Springs, in&s;omuch that in the principal Street, in the Ea&s;t Part of the Town, there are Wells bricked up Knee-high almo&s;t at every hundred Yards, which the whole Year generally overflow from one to another, all the way down the Declivity of the Hill on which the Town &s;tands. The Soil is exceeding rich, and the City is encompa&s;&s;ed with Gardens, the Produce of which is &s;o excellent, that it furni&s;hes all the County for 20 Miles round, even as far as <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and <HI>St. Ives</HI>; the former of which has almo&s;t all its Garden-&s;tuff from hence. Great Quantities of Strawberries are cultivated here, particularly of the white Wood &s;ort.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable thing that I ob&s;erved of the Min&s;ter was, that it is &s;een for many Miles round; but is &s;o old, that it &s;eems to totter with every high Gu&s;t of Wind.</P>
<P>On the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>Cam,</HI> a little below <HI>Ely,</HI> &s;tands <HI>Soham,</HI> a little Market-town towards the Borders of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> near the Mar&s;hes, which were formerly dangerous to pa&s;s; but now there is a Cau&s;ey made, which leads very &s;ecurely over them. Here are the Remains of an antient Church, which was ruined by the <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>We proceeded from hence to <HI>Newmarket.</HI> Near <HI>Snaybell,</HI> as we went, we &s;aw a noble Seat of Ad|miral
<PB N="78" REF="85">
<HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> created Earl of <HI>Orford,</HI> for the glorious Victory obtained under his Command over the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, and the burning their Ships at <HI>La Hogue.</HI></P>
<P>The Situation of this Hou&s;e is low, and on the Edge of the Fen Country; but the Building is fine, the Apartments noble, and the Gardens well-fini&s;hed. On the Earl's Death it devolved to <HI>Samuel Sandys,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in Right of his Wife, one of the Earl's Heirs, who now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it.</P>
<P>Arriving at <HI>Newmarket</HI> in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> I had the Opportunity to &s;ee the Hor&s;e-races, and a great Concour&s;e of the Nobility and Gentry, as well from <HI>London,</HI> as from all Parts of <HI>England</HI>; but they were all &s;o intent, &s;o eager, &s;o bu&s;y upon what is called the &s;harping Part of the Sport, of Wagers and Bets, that to me they &s;eemed rather like &s;o many Hor&s;e-cour&s;ers in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> than Per&s;ons of Dig|nity and Quality, who de&s;cend &s;o low as even to circumvent one another; and, if I may &s;peak it, pick one another's Pockets. To &s;ee a Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction who, perhaps, being ennobled, his Word of Honour, by the Laws of the Land, is to be e&s;teemed and received with equal Sanction as an Oath in our Courts of Ju&s;tice, level him&s;elf with a Groom, or a Riding-boy, and put his Credit and Honour in his Hands with a Bribe, to betray his Ma&s;ter and his Tru&s;t, is a thing &s;carce credible among tho&s;e who are really Men of Honour; and yet it is too often the Ca&s;e, to the indelible Shame of Men of Rank and Quality be it &s;poken in particular, and to the Reproach of the Nation in general! How different is this Conduct from that of tho&s;e in the <HI>Circus</HI> at <HI>Rome?</HI> How much more different from tho&s;e who gained &s;o much Honour in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Races? What <HI>Pindar</HI> could be found in the&s;e Days to celebrate them? What mu&s;t his Subject be, Tricks and Circumventions! Alas! How dege|nerate! And yet the&s;e Races were in&s;tituted with
<PB N="79" REF="86">
a very good Intent, to rai&s;e an Emulation in our Nobility and Gentry, to keep up and pre&s;erve a Race of good Hor&s;es, in Honour of the Nation in general; but as the In&s;titution is deba&s;ed, it is not the be&s;t Hor&s;e that wins the Race; but that which is de&s;tined for it by a Combination.</P>
<P>Before I was let into the Secret, as 'tis called, which is indeed nothing but the knavi&s;h Part of the Sport, I was much diverted with the&s;e Races; but when I was, I rejoiced not a little at the Regulation that it has met with from the Power that only had Authority to make it. For this Diver&s;ion becoming a publick Nui&s;ance, by &s;preading it&s;elf in little Matches all over the Kingdom, the Legi&s;lature took Cognizance of it, and in the 13th of King <HI>George</HI> II. a Law pa&s;&s;ed, which injoins as follows; <HI>viz.</HI>

<P>I went in the Intervals of the Sport to &s;ee the fine Seats of the Gentlemen in the neighbouring County; for this Part of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> being an open champain Country, and in a healthy Air, is formed for Plea|&s;ure, and all kinds of rural Diver&s;ion; Nature,

as it were, inviting the Gentlemen to vi&s;it her, where &s;he is plentifully furni&s;hed to receive them; and the Country is accordingly in a manner covered with fine Palaces of the Nobility, and plea&s;ant Seats of the Gentry.</P>
<P><HI>Eu&s;ton-hall,</HI> the Seat of the Duke of <HI>Grafton,</HI> lies in the open Country towards the Side of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> not far from <HI>Thetford</HI>; a Place capable of all that is plea&s;ant and delightful in Nature, and greatly im|proved by Art.</P>
<P>From thence I went to <HI>Ru&s;hbrook,</HI> formerly the Seat of the noble Family of <HI>Jermyns,</HI> lately Lord <HI>Dover,</HI> and now of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Davers.</HI> Then we &s;aw <HI>Brently,</HI> the Seat of the Earl of <HI>Dy&s;ert,</HI> and the antient Palace of my Lord <HI>Cornwallis,</HI> with &s;everal others mo&s;t agreeably &s;ituated, and adorned with the Beauties-both of Art and Nature.</P>
<P><HI>Newmarket</HI> is a hand&s;ome well-built Town, and being a Thorough-fare, reaps no &s;mall Advantage by that means as well as from the Races. It con|&s;i&s;ts chiefly of one long Street, the North-&s;ide of which is in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and the South in <HI>Cambridge&s;hire.</HI> The King has a Hou&s;e of his own, where he re&s;ides when he thinks fit to come to the Races. The Town has two Churches belonging to it, and a Free-&s;chool endowed by King <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>We entered <HI>Cambridge&s;hire</HI> out of <HI>Suffolk</HI> with all the Advantage that can be imagined; ju&s;t upon tho&s;e plea&s;ant and agreeable Plains, called <HI>Newmarket-Heath.</HI> Acro&s;s which extends a Fortification, or Ditch, with a Rampart, commonly called <HI>The Devil's Dyke,</HI> as Works of an extraordinary Nature are generally, by the Vulgar, attributed to that Prince of Darkne&s;s thro' the Nation; but among the Gentry it is be&s;t known by the Name of <HI>Rech Dyke,</HI> from <HI>Rech,</HI> a &s;mall Market-town lying near the Heath. It is &s;up|po&s;ed to have been the Boundary of the Kingdom of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Angles.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="88">Pa&s;&s;ing this Ditch, we &s;ee from the Hills called <HI>Gogmagog,</HI> or rather <HI>Hogmagog,</HI> a rich and plea&s;ant Vale We&s;tward, covered with Corn-fields, Gentle|mens Seats, Villages; and at a Di&s;tance, to crown all the re&s;t, that antient and truly famous Town and Univer&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> Capital of the County.</P>
<P><HI>Cambridge&s;hire,</HI> except the Fen Country, is almo&s;t wholly a Corn Country; and of that Corn five Parts in &s;ix of all they &s;ow, is Barley, which is generally &s;old to <HI>Ware</HI> and <HI>Roy&s;ton,</HI> and other great Malting-towns in <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> and is the Fund from whence that va&s;t Quantity of Malt, called <HI>Hertford&s;hire</HI> Malt, is made, which is e&s;teemed the be&s;t in <HI>Eng|land.</HI> As <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> are taken up in Manufactures, and famed for Indu&s;try, this County has no Manufacture at all; nor are the Poor, except the Hu&s;bandmen, noted for any thing &s;o much as Idlene&s;s and Sloth, to their Scandal be it &s;poken! What the Rea&s;on of it is, I know not.</P>
<P>On the Top of <HI>Hogmagog Hills</HI> appears an antient Camp, or Fortification, with a treble Rampart and Ditch, which mo&s;t of our Writers &s;ay was neither <HI>Roman</HI> nor <HI>Saxon,</HI> but <HI>Briti&s;h.</HI> King <HI>James</HI> II. cau&s;ed a &s;pacious Stable to be built in the Area of this Camp, for his Running-hor&s;es, and made old Mr. <HI>Frampton</HI> Ma&s;ter or In&s;pector of them: The Stables remain &s;till there, tho' they are not often made u&s;e of. The Earl <HI>Godolphin</HI> has here a fine Hou&s;e on the very Summit of the Hill, to which his Lord&s;hip frequently re&s;orts, e&s;pecially in the Racing-&s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>As we de&s;cended We&s;tward, we &s;aw the Fen Country on our Right, almo&s;t all covered with Water like a Sea. The <HI>Michaelmas</HI> Rains, having been very great that Year, &s;ent down va&s;t Floods of Water from the Upland Countries; and tho&s;e Fens being the Sink of no le&s;s than 13 Counties, they are often thus overflowed.

In a Word, all the Water of the Middle Part of <HI>England,</HI> which does not run into the <HI>Thames</HI> or the <HI>Trent,</HI> comes down into the&s;e Fens.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Fens are abundance of tho&s;e admirable Pieces of Art call'd <HI>Duckoys,</HI> and it is incredible what Quantities of Wild-fowl of all &s;orts, Duck, Mal|lard, Teal, Wigeon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they take in them every Week during the Sea&s;on: It may indeed be gue&s;&s;ed at in &s;ome mea&s;ure by this, that there is a Duckoy not far from <HI>Ely,</HI> which yields the Landlord 500<HI>l.</HI> a Year clear of the Charge of maintaining a great Number of Servants for the Management; from whence alone they a&s;&s;ured me at <HI>St. Ives,</HI> (a Town on the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> whither the Fowls are always brought to be conveyed to <HI>London</HI>) that they generally &s;ent up 3000 Couples a Week.</P>
<P>There are more of the&s;e about <HI>Peterborough,</HI> from whence Waggon Loads are &s;ent up twice a Week to <HI>London.</HI> I have &s;een the&s;e Waggons, before the Act of Parliament to regulate Carriers, drawn by ten or twelve Hor&s;es apiece, they were loaden &s;o heavy.</P>
<P>As the&s;e Fens appear overwhelm'd with Water, I ob&s;erved that they generally at this latter Part of the Year appear al&s;o covered with Fogs; &s;o that, when the Downs and higher Grounds of the adja|cent Country gli&s;tered with the Beams of the Sun,
<PB N="83" REF="90">
the <HI>I&s;le of Ely</HI> &s;eemed wrapped up in Mi&s;t and Darkne&s;s, &s;o that nothing could be di&s;cerned but now and then the Cupola of <HI>Ely</HI> Min&s;ter.</P>
<P>One could hardly &s;ee this from the Hills, without Concern for the many thou&s;and Families confined to tho&s;e Fogs, who had no other Breath to draw, than what mu&s;t be mixed with the choaking Vapours, which &s;pread over all the Country: but notwith|&s;tanding this, the People, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are u&s;ed to it, live as healthy as tho&s;e in a clearer Air, except now-and-then an Ague, which they make light of; and there are great Numbers of very antient People among them. An Act pa&s;&s;ed a few Years ago for the effectual Draining and Pre&s;ervation of <HI>Haddenham Level</HI> in the <HI>I&s;le of Ely,</HI> which contains 6500 Acres, which were overflowed chiefly thro' the Neglect of pre&s;erving and clearing the Out-falls into the Sea; and as the&s;e Grounds are naturally very rich and fertile, it may be imagined what a Benefit mu&s;t accrue to the Publick by this means, when the Draining and Recovery of them can be completed.</P>
<P>Having been at <HI>Sturbridge-fair,</HI> when it was in its Height in the Month of <HI>September,</HI> the Year before I was at <HI>Newmarket,</HI> I mu&s;t &s;ay, that it is not only the greate&s;t in the whole Nation, but I think in <HI>Europe</HI>; nor is the Fair at <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> in <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Mart at <HI>Frankfort</HI> on the <HI>Main,</HI> or the Fairs at <HI>Nuremberg,</HI> or <HI>Au&s;burg,</HI> reputed any way com|parable to this at <HI>Sturbridge</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Fair is pretty much dwindled &s;ince this Account of it; tho' it is &s;till very con&s;iderable.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is kept in a large Corn-field, near <HI>Ca&s;terton,</HI> extending from the Side of the River <HI>Cam,</HI> towards the Road, for about half a Mile &s;quare.</P>
<P>If the Field be not cleared of the Corn before a certain Day in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Fair-keepers may trample it under-foot, to build their Booths or Tents. On
<PB N="84" REF="91">
the other hand, to balance that Severity, if the Fair-keepers have not cleared the Field by another certain Day in <HI>September,</HI> the Plowmen may re-enter with Plow and Cart, and overthrow all into the Dirt; and as for the Filth, Dung, Straw, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> left behind by the Fair-keepers, which is very con&s;iderable, the&s;e become the Farmers Fees, and make them full Amends for the trampling, riding, carting upon, and hardening the Ground.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe all the Parts and Cir|cum&s;tances of this Fair exactly; the Shops are placed in Rows like Streets, whereof one is called <HI>Cheap-&s;ide</HI>; and here, as in &s;everal other Streets, are all Sorts of Traders, who &s;ell by Retale, and come chiefly from <HI>London.</HI> Here may be &s;een Gold&s;miths, Toymen, Bra&s;iers, Turners, Milaners, Haberda&s;hers, Hatters, Mercers, Drapers, Pewterers, China-ware-hou&s;es, and, in a Word, all Trades that can be found in <HI>London</HI>; with Coffee-hou&s;es, Taverns, and Eating-hou&s;es in great Numbers and all kept in Tents and Booths.</P>
<P>This great Street reaches from the Road, which, as I &s;aid, goes from <HI>Cambridge</HI> to <HI>Newmarket,</HI> turn|ing &s;hort out of it to the Right towards the River, and holds in a Line near half a Mile quite down to the River-&s;ide. In another Street parallel with the Road are the like Rows of Booths, but &s;omewhat larger, and more intermingled with Whole&s;ale Dealers; and one Side, pa&s;&s;ing out of this la&s;t Street to the Left-hand, is a great Square, formed of the large&s;t Booths, called the <HI>Duddery</HI>; but whence &s;o called, I could not learn. The Area of this Square is from 80 to 100 Yards, where the Dealers have room before every Booth to take down and open their Packs, and to bring in Waggons to load and unload.</P>
<P>This Place being peculiar to the Whole&s;ale Dealers in the Woollen Manufacture, the Booths,
<PB N="85" REF="92">
or Tents are of a va&s;t Extent, have different Apart|ments, and the Quantities of Goods they bring are &s;o great, that the In&s;ides of them look like &s;o many <HI>Blackwell-halls,</HI> and are va&s;t Warehou&s;es piled up with Goods to the Top. In this <HI>Duddery,</HI> as I have been informed, have been &s;old 100,000 Pounds-worth of Woollen Manufactures in le&s;s than a Week's time; be&s;ides the prodigious Trade carried on here by Whole&s;ale-men from <HI>London,</HI> and all Parts of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> who tran&s;act their Bu&s;ine&s;s wholly in their Pocket-books, and meeting their Chapmen from all Parts, make up their Accounts, receive Money chiefly in Bills, and take Orders. The&s;e, they &s;ay, exceed by far the Sales of Goods actually brought to the Fair, and delivered in Kind; it being frequent for the <HI>London</HI> Whole&s;ale-men to carry back Orders from their Dealers, for 10,000 Pounds-worth of Goods a Man, and &s;ome much more. This e&s;pecially re&s;pects tho&s;e People, who deal in heavy Goods, as Whole&s;ale Grocers, Salters, Bra&s;iers, Iron-merchants, Wine-merchants, and the like; but does not exclude the Dealers in Woollen Manu|factures, and e&s;pecially in Mercery Goods of all &s;orts, who generally manage their Bu&s;ine&s;s in this manner.</P>

<P>But all this is &s;till out-done, at lea&s;t in Appear|ance, by two Articles, which are the Peculiars of this Fair, and are not exhibited till the other Part of the Fair, <HI>for the Woollen Manufacture,</HI> begins to clo&s;e up: The&s;e are the WOOLL, and the HOPS. There is &s;carce any Price fixed for Hops in <HI>England,</HI> till they know how they &s;ell at <HI>Sturbridge-fair</HI>; the Quantity that appears in the Fair is indeed prodigious, and they take up a large Part of the Field, on which the Fair is kept, to them&s;elves; they are brought directly from <HI>Chelmsford</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> from <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and from <HI>Farnham</HI> in <HI>Surrey</HI>; be&s;ides what are brought from <HI>London,</HI> of the Growth of tho&s;e and other Places.</P>
<P>Inquiring why this Fair &s;hould be thus, of all other Places in <HI>England,</HI> the Centre of that Trade, and &s;o great a Quantity of &s;o bulky a Commodity be carried thither &s;o far; I was informed by one thoroughly acquainted with that Matter, That Hops, for this Part of <HI>England,</HI> grow principally in the two Counties of <HI>Surrey</HI> and <HI>Kent,</HI> with an Exception only to the Town of <HI>Chelmsford</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and there are very few planted any-where el&s;e.</P>
<P>There are indeed in the We&s;t of <HI>England</HI> &s;ome Hops growing; as at <HI>Wilton,</HI> near <HI>Sali&s;bury</HI>; at <HI>Hereford</HI> and <HI>Broom&s;grove,</HI> near <HI>Wales,</HI> and the like; but the Quantity is incon&s;iderable, and the Places &s;o remote, that none of them come to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="94">Formerly in the North of <HI>England,</HI> few Hops were u&s;ed, their Drink being chiefly pale &s;mooth Ale, which required but little Hops; and con&s;e|quently they planted none North of <HI>Trent.</HI> But as for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, they not only brew great Quantities of Beer in the North, but al&s;o u&s;e Hops in the Brewing their Ale much more than they did before, &s;o they all come South of <HI>Trent</HI> to buy their Hops; and here being va&s;t Quantities brought, 'tis great Part of their back Carriage into <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Northampton&s;hire, Derby&s;hire, Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and all tho&s;e Counties; nay, of late, &s;ince the Union, even &s;o far as <HI>Scotland</HI>; for I mu&s;t not omit here al&s;o to mention, that the River <HI>Grant,</HI> or <HI>Cam,</HI> which runs clo&s;e by the North-we&s;t Side of the Fair, in its Cour&s;e from <HI>Cambridge</HI> to <HI>Ely,</HI> is navigable; and that by this means, all heavy Goods are brought to the Fair-field, by Water-carriage from <HI>London,</HI> and other Parts; fir&s;t to the Port of <HI>Lynn,</HI> and then in Barges up the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> from the <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> into the <HI>Cam,</HI> and &s;o to the very Edge of the Fair.</P>
<P>In like manner great Quantities of heavy Goods, and Hops among the re&s;t, are &s;ent from the Fair to <HI>Lynn</HI> by Water, and &s;hipped there for the <HI>Humber,</HI> to <HI>Hull, York,</HI> &amp;c. and for <HI>Newca&s;tle upon Tyne,</HI> and by <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> to <HI>Scotland.</HI> Now, as they do not yet plant Hops in the North, tho' the Con&s;umption there is great and increa&s;ing daily, this is one Rea&s;on why at <HI>Sturbridge-fair</HI> there is &s;o great a Demand for them: be&s;ides, there were very few Hops, if any worth naming, growing in all the Counties even on this &s;ide <HI>Trent,</HI> above 40 Miles from <HI>London,</HI> tho&s;e Counties depending on <HI>Sturbridge-fair</HI> for their Supply; &s;o the Counties of <HI>Suffolk, Norfolk, Cam|bridge, Huntingdon, Northampton, Lincoln, Leice&s;ter, Rutland,</HI> and even to <HI>Stafford, Warwick</HI> and <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> bought mo&s;t of, if not all, their Hops at <HI>Sturbridge-fair.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="95">This is a Te&s;timony of the prodigious Re&s;ort of the trading People of all Parts of <HI>England</HI> to this Fair; where &s;urpri&s;ing Quantities of Hops formerly have been &s;old.</P>
<P>The Article of Wooll is of &s;everal Sorts; but principally Fleece Wooll, out of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> where the longe&s;t Staple is found, the Sheep of tho&s;e Parts being of the large&s;t Breed.</P>
<P>The Buyers are chiefly the Manufacturers of <HI>Nor|folk, Suffolk,</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and it is a prodigious Quan|tity they buy.</P>
<P>Here I &s;aw what I have not ob&s;erved in any other County of <HI>England,</HI> a <HI>Pocket</HI> of Wooll, which &s;eems to have been at fir&s;t called &s;o in Mockery, this <HI>Pocket</HI> being &s;o big, that it loads a whole Waggon, and reaches beyond the mo&s;t extreme Parts of it, hanging over both before and behind; and the&s;e ordinarily weigh a Ton or 2500 <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> Weight of Wooll, all in one Bag.</P>
<P>The Quantity of Wooll only, which has been &s;old at this Place at one Fair, has been &s;aid to amount to 50 or 60,000<HI>l.</HI> in Value; &s;ome &s;ay, a great deal more.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Articles a Stranger may make &s;ome Gue&s;s at the immen&s;e Trade which is carried on at this Place; what prodigious Quantities of Goods are bought and &s;old, and what a va&s;t Concour&s;e of Peo|ple are &s;een here from all Parts of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I might proceed to &s;peak of &s;everal other Sorts of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures, which are brought hither to be &s;old; as all Sorts of wrought Iron, and Bra&s;s Ware from <HI>Birmingham</HI>; edged Tools, Knives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from <HI>Sheffield,</HI> Gla&s;s Wares, and Stockens, from <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI>; and unaccountable Quantities of other Things of &s;maller Value every Morning.</P>
<P>To attend this Fair, and the prodigious Crouds of People which re&s;ort to it, there are &s;ometimes no
<PB N="89" REF="96">
le&s;s than 50 Hackney Coaches, which come from <HI>London,</HI> and ply Night and Morning to carry the People to and from <HI>Cambridge</HI>; for there the Gro&s;s of them lodge; nay, which is &s;till more &s;trange, there are Wherries brought from <HI>London</HI> on Wag|gons, to ply upon the little River <HI>Cam,</HI> and to row People up and down, from the Town, and from the Fair, as Occa&s;ion pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>It is not to be wondered at, if the Town of <HI>Cambridge</HI> cannot receive or entertain the Numbers of People that come to this Fair; for not <HI>Cambridge</HI> only, but all the Towns round are full; nay, the very Barns and Stables are turned into Inns, to lodge the meaner Sort of People: As for the Fair People, they all eat, drink, and &s;leep in their Booths, which are &s;o intermingled with Taverns, Coffee-hou&s;es, Drinking-hou&s;es, Eating-hou&s;es, Cooks Shops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o many Butchers and Higglers from all the neighbouring Counties come in every Morning with Beef, Mutton, Fowls, Butter, Bread, Chee&s;e, Eggs, and &s;uch Things, and go with them from Tent to Tent, from Door to Door, that there's no Want of Provi&s;ions of any Kind, either dre&s;&s;ed, or undre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In a Word, the Fair is like a well-governed City, and there is the lea&s;t Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion (I be|lieve) that can be &s;een any-where, with &s;o great a Concour&s;e of People.</P>
<P>Towards the latter End of the Fair, and when the great Hurry of Whole&s;ale Bu&s;ine&s;s begins to be over, the Gentry come in, from all Parts of the County round; and tho' they come for their Diver|&s;ion, yet 'tis not a little Money they lay out, which generally falls to the Share of the Retalers; &s;uch as the Toy-&s;hops, Gold&s;miths, Bra&s;iers, Ironmongers, Turners, Milaners, Mercers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;ome loo&s;e Corns they re&s;erve for the Puppet-&s;hews, Drolls, Rope-dancers, and &s;uch-like; of which there is no
<PB N="90" REF="97">
Want. The la&s;t Day of the Fair is the <HI>Hor&s;e-fair,</HI> where the Whole is clo&s;ed both with Hor&s;e and Foot-races, to divert the meaner Sort of People only; for nothing con&s;iderable is offered of that Kind, and the late Act, I pre&s;ume, mu&s;t have put an End to the former. Thus ends the whole Fair, and in le&s;s than a Week more, &s;carce any Sign is left, that &s;uch a thing has been there, except by the Heaps of Dung and Straw, and other Rubbi&s;h which is left behind, trod into the Earth, and is as good as a Summer's Fallow for the Land; and as I have &s;aid above, pays the Hu&s;bandman well for the U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have mentioned, that here is a Court of Ju&s;tice always open, and held every Day in a Shed built on purpo&s;e in the Fair: this is for keeping the Peace, and deciding Controver&s;ies in Matters ari&s;ing from the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Fair. The Magi|&s;trates of the Town of <HI>Cambridge</HI> are Judges in this Court, as being in their Juri&s;diction, or they holding it by &s;pecial Privilege. Here they determine Mat|ters in a &s;ummary way, as is practi&s;ed in tho&s;e we call <HI>Pye-Powder Courts</HI> in other Places, or as a <HI>Court of Con&s;cience</HI>; and they have a final Authority with|out Appeal.</P>
<P>Having ju&s;t mentioned the Puppet-&s;hews, Drolls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with which the People are entertained during the Time of this Fair, I cannot but relate a deplorable Accident that happened on this Occa&s;ion, at <HI>Barn|welt</HI> in this Neighbourhood, as follows.</P>
<P>On the 8th of <HI>September,</HI> 1727. about Eight at Night, a Puppet-&s;hew being to be acted in a Barn built of <HI>Barnwell</HI> Stone, and thatched with Straw, a Fellow attempted to thru&s;t him&s;elf in without pay|ing; but being refu&s;ed, and the Door locked, and, as &s;ome report, nailed, to keep out Intruders, the Villain threatened he would &s;et the Barn on Fire over their Heads, in Revenge. There was a Place ad|joining to the Barn, where were Hay and Straw; and
<PB N="91" REF="98">
a Boy &s;etting down a wooden Lantern with a &s;hort Candle in it at a little Di&s;tance, whil&s;t he was look|ing thro' a Hole at the Sight, the villainous Fellow afore&s;aid beat the Lantern about, till the Fire took the Straw, which he left burning, and run away. There was a Floor above them, and the Flame, getting into the fal&s;e Roof, &s;pread like Wildfire. The People, in the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation, all making to the Door, which opened inwards, fell upon one another, and became, as it were, &s;o many Barri|cadoes to hinder its being opened: and ju&s;t at this fatal Cri&s;is, the Fire having &s;eized &s;ome, and dread|ful Shrieks and Cries re&s;ounding from all, the Floor fell in, and &s;mothered almo&s;t all; for not above five or &s;ix e&s;caped of the Whole, and about 120 Men, Women, and Children, mi&s;erably peri&s;hed. The next Day it was one of the mo&s;t &s;hocking Sights that ever was beheld, to &s;ee the Relations of the unhappy Per&s;ons flocking thither, to find and own the Bodies, &s;ome of their Brothers, &s;ome of their Children, &s;ome of their Wives and Hu&s;bands, which they found Difficulty enough to di&s;cover; for &s;ome of them had their Heads burnt off, &s;ome their Legs, &s;ome their Hands and Arms, and others, in a man|ner, con&s;umed to A&s;hes. And at la&s;t, mo&s;t of the mangled Bodies were carried in Carts, and put pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly into a large Hole dug in the Church-yard for that Purpo&s;e. Among the unfortunate Sufferers were &s;everal young Gentlewomen of con&s;iderable Fortunes. About four Years after this, another terrible Fire happened, which almo&s;t con&s;umed the whole Town of <HI>Barnwell.</HI></P>
<P>Within the&s;e few Years, a fine Road, of about four Miles in Length, is completed, from the Town of <HI>Cambridge</HI> to <HI>Hogmagog-hills</HI>; which, by rea&s;on of the Badne&s;s of the Way in that Place, is an ex|ceeding u&s;eful Benefaction to the Town; which generous Work was done in pur&s;uance of the Will

<P>The Two Univer&s;ities of <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Oxford</HI> are &s;o much the Glory of this Nation, that it would be an almo&s;t unpardonable Defect in me, not to take particular Notice of them. I &s;hall refer that of <HI>Ox|ford</HI> to its proper Place; and here give as brief an Account as I can of this of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and of the Originals and Founders of the &s;everal Colleges, to|gether with the Favours and Advantages that have been within the&s;e few Years conferred upon it by his late Maje&s;ty, and other Benefactors.</P>
<P>The Town is governed by a Mayor and Alder|men; but with regard to the Government of the Univer&s;ity, that has a <HI>Chancellor,</HI> eligible every three Years, <HI>aut manere in eodem Officio durante tacito con&s;en&s;u Senatus Cantabr.</HI> He hath under him a <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary,</HI> who holds a Court of Record of Civil Cau&s;es for all privileged Per&s;ons and Scholars, under the Degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a <HI>High Steward,</HI> cho&s;en by the Senate, and holding by Patent from the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vice-Chancellor</HI> is annually cho&s;en on the 4th of <HI>November,</HI> by the Body of the Univer&s;ity, out of Two Per&s;ons nominated by the Heads of Colleges.</P>
<P>Two <HI>Proctors</HI> are al&s;o annually cho&s;en, as at <HI>Oxford</HI>; as al&s;o are Two <HI>Taxers,</HI> who, with the Proctors, have Cognizance of Weights and Mea&s;ures, as Clerks of the Market.</P>
<P>The Univer&s;ity has al&s;o a <HI>Cu&s;tos Archivorum,</HI> or <HI>Regi&s;ter</HI>; Three <HI>E&s;quire Beadles,</HI> One <HI>Yeoman Bea|dle,</HI> and a <HI>Library-keeper.</HI></P>
<P>The Vice-chancellor &s;ometimes vi&s;its the Taverns and other Publick-hou&s;es in his own Per&s;on: but the Proctors do it very frequently, and have Power to puni&s;h offending Scholars, and to fine the Publick-hou&s;es who entertain them after Eight at Night in the Winter, or Nine in Summer.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="100">As to the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Cam|bridge</HI>; the Story goes, That <HI>Cantaber,</HI> a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> 270 Years before Chri&s;t, fir&s;t founded it; and that <HI>Sebert,</HI> King of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Angles,</HI> re&s;tored it, <HI>Anno Chri&s;ti</HI> 630. Afterwards, as the learned <HI>Camden</HI> ob&s;erves, it lay a long time neglected, and was overthrown by the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Storms, till all Things revived under the <HI>Norman</HI> Government. Soon after Inns, Ho&s;tels, and Halls were built for Students, tho' without Endowments. There are now 16 Col|leges and Halls, which differ only in Name, being equally endowed and privileged; 16 Ma&s;ters, 406 Fellow&s;hips; about 662 Scholar&s;hips, 236 Exhi|bitions; and the whole Number of Ma&s;ters, Fellows, Scholars, Exhibitioners, and other Students, are about 1500.</P>

It con&s;titutes one Side of a large Square; for the Royal Founder de|&s;igned, that the College &s;hould be a Quadrangle, all of equal Beauty: but the Civil Wars in which he was involved with the Hou&s;e of <HI>York,</HI> prevented his accompli&s;hing it; and the Pro&s;ecution of his good De&s;ign was re&s;erved to our own Time; for what has been added within the&s;e few Years pa&s;t, is not only an Ornament to the College, but to the whole Univer&s;ity: and it is to be hoped, that the College will be enabled, in Time, to fini&s;h the noble Work.

<P><HI>Febr.</HI> 1734, the Workmen digging for the Foun|dation of the new Buildings of this College, found a great Number of Broad Pieces of Gold, of the Coin of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. exceeding fair.

<P><HI>Cambridge-ca&s;tle</HI> was built by <HI>William the Con|queror,</HI> as one of tho&s;e many which he erected in divers Parts, to curb his newly conquered People. It was &s;trong and &s;tately, and had in it, among other &s;pacious Apartments, a mo&s;t magnificent Hall. This being neglected, the Stones and Timber of it were afterwards begged of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. by the Ma&s;ter and Fellows of <HI>King's-hall,</HI> towards the Building of their Chapel. Nothing is now &s;tanding but the Gate|hou&s;e, which is the Pri&s;on, and an artificial high Hill of a &s;teep A&s;cent, and level at Top.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Cambridge</HI> is very large, mo&s;t of its Streets are narrow, the Hou&s;es very ill-built, and the greate&s;t Part of them much out of Repair; &s;o that, were it not for the Colleges, and other publick Edifices, it would make a very mean Appearance.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cambridge</HI> the Road lies North-we&s;t, on the Edge of the Fens, to <HI>Huntingdon</HI>; on which &s;tands the little Market-town of <HI>Caxton,</HI> remark|able for the Birth-place of <HI>Caxton,</HI> the fir&s;t Printer in <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Roman</HI> Way pa&s;&s;es from <HI>Arington</HI> S.

<P>From <HI>Cambridge,</HI> my De&s;ign obliging me, and the direct Road in part concurring, I came back thro' the We&s;t Side of the County of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> to <HI>Saffron-Walden,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Linton,</HI> a &s;mall Market|town of no Note, &s;aying that a <HI>Roman</HI> Military Way falls into the <HI>Ikening</HI> here.</P>
<P><HI>Saffron-Walden</HI> is a fair Town, with a good Church, where &s;tands a Monument of the Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> Chancellor to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who made him a Grant of certain Lands belonging to a di&s;&s;olved Mona&s;tery near this Town, which takes its Name from the great Quantities of Saffron which formerly grew in the Grounds, and were cultivated here|abouts, and an&s;wered exceeding well in the Manu|facturing; but how it came into Decay, nobody could account to me, though there may be &s;till &s;een a great many Acres of Saffron-ground about this Town. This Commodity was never known to grow in <HI>England,</HI> till the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. This Town gives Title of Baron to the Earl of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> who&s;e elde&s;t Son is by Courte&s;y called Lord <HI>Walden.</HI></P>
<P>Near this Town, on the Side of <HI>Cambridge</HI> Road, &s;tands the noble and &s;tately Palace of <HI>Audley-Inn,</HI> on <HI>Audley-end,</HI> formerly the large&s;t Palace of any in <HI>England</HI>; and tho' a great Part of it has been pulled down, is &s;till one of the mo&s;t magnificent Structures

in the whole Kingdom. It was built out of the Ruins of the above-mentioned Mona&s;tery, by <HI>Thomas</HI> &s;econd Son of <HI>Thomas</HI> Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who married the only Daughter and Heir of the afore-named Lord <HI>Audley.</HI> This <HI>Thomas</HI> was &s;ummoned into Parlia|ment in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, as Lord <HI>Audley</HI> of <HI>Walden</HI>; and was afterwards created Earl of <HI>Suffolk</HI> by King <HI>James</HI> I. to whom he was fir&s;t Chamber|lain, and afterwards Lord High-Trea&s;urer. It was de&s;igned for a Royal Palace for that King, and when it was fini&s;hed with all the Elegance and Politene&s;s of Ta&s;te of the Times, the King was invited to &s;ee it; and as he pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>Newmarket,</HI> he took up a Night's Lodging there. And after having viewed it with great Surpri&s;e and A&s;toni&s;hment, the Earl a&s;ked him, How he approved of it? Who an&s;wer'd, Very well. But troth, Man, &s;aid he, 'tis <HI>too much</HI> for a <HI>King</HI>; but it may <HI>do</HI> for a <HI>Lord High-Trea&s;urer</HI>; and &s;o left it upon the Earl's Hands, who is reported to have had then an E&s;tate of 50,000<HI>l.</HI> a Year, which has been gradually decaying ever &s;ince, and is now reduced to about 3000<HI>l.</HI> a Year with Incumbrances upon it. King <HI>Charles</HI> II. purcha&s;ed this Hou&s;e, and &s;o it became, what it was originally de&s;igned for, a Royal Palace. The King mortgaged the Hearth-tax to the Earl, to an&s;wer the Purcha&s;e-money; and appointed <HI>James,</HI> then Earl of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> Hou&s;e-keeper thereof, with a Salary of 1000<HI>l.</HI> a Year; which Office continued in the Family till the Revolution, when the Hearth-tax was aboli&s;hed. And the Exigence of the State being &s;uch as it could not afford to pay the Purcha&s;e-money, King <HI>William</HI> III. regranted the &s;aid Hou&s;e to the Family; upon which <HI>Henry,</HI> Earl of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> (who in his Father's Life-time was created Earl of <HI>Bindon,</HI> to qualify him to hold the Mar&s;hal's Staff) pull'd down a great Part of this noble Edifice, and reduced it con&s;iderably. And yet it is &s;till very large, and
<PB N="107" REF="114">
makes a grand Appearance. You enter in at a large wide Pair of Iron Gates into a mo&s;t &s;pacious Court-yard, on each Side of which was formerly a Row of Cloy&s;ters, in which &s;tood the Out-offices belong|ing to the Hou&s;e; which have been all pulled down, and &s;upplied with a Stone Wall. You pa&s;s in at the Fore-front, thro' Part of the Hou&s;e, into a large open Quadrangle, inclo&s;ed by four different Parts of the Hou&s;e, and almo&s;t &s;urrounded with Cloy&s;ters. The Apartments above and below are very lofty and &s;pacious; and there is a very long wide Gallery, which extends the whole Length of the Back-front of the Hou&s;e. The Gardens are very indifferent, but very capable of Improvement. Behind the Hou&s;e is a fine Park, extending to <HI>Saffron-Walden,</HI> well &s;tored with Deer, but not over-burdened with Timber; in which there is a ri&s;ing Spot of Ground, whereon if the Hou&s;e had been erected, it would have had a much better Effect as to Pro&s;pect; for its pre&s;ent Situation is low, neither are the Grounds about it very fertile, or, I think, healthy.</P>
<P>But however great and magnificent this noble Hou&s;e appears, it bears an indelible Stain, if what is &s;aid be true, That it was built with <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gold, upon the Ruin of the Great and Learned <HI>Ralegh,</HI> who fell by the Revenge of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Arts of <HI>Gundamor,</HI> the Avarice of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and the unpardonable Weak|ne&s;s of his own King. But the pre&s;ent Earl's Mind is more nobly endowed than that of his great An|ce&s;tor, as being a generous and truly charitable Nobleman, which he has te&s;tified by many bene|ficent Acts among his poor Neighbours, e&s;pecially during the great Fro&s;t in the Winter of 1739.</P>
<P>At a little Town called <HI>Littlebury,</HI> not far from <HI>Audley-Inn,</HI> is a Hou&s;e which was erected by the famous Mr. <HI>Win&s;tanley,</HI> who built <HI>Eddy-&s;tone</HI> Light-hou&s;e, and peri&s;hed in it, as I &s;hall mention in its Place. Here he had made many odd Contrivances

of Chairs running on Springs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which u&s;ually much &s;urpri&s;ed Strangers, who came to &s;ee the Hou&s;e. The Per&s;on appointed to &s;hew it generally placed the greate&s;t Stranger into a particular Chair, which, on touching the Spring, ran backward thro' the Hou&s;e into the Garden. The &s;ame Gentleman was famous al&s;o for his Water-works, full of whim&s;ical, but ingenious Contrivances.</P>
<P>But I ought not to omit, that near <HI>Icleton</HI> and <HI>Strethal,</HI> upon the River <HI>Cam,</HI> lies <HI>Che&s;terford</HI>; where, in the Year 1719, were di&s;covered the <HI>Ve&s;tigia</HI> of a <HI>Roman</HI> City. The Foundation of the Walls is very apparent quite round, tho' level with the Ground, including about 50 Acres. Great Part of it &s;erves for a Cau&s;eway to the publick <HI>Cambridge</HI> Road from <HI>London.</HI> The <HI>Crown Inn</HI> is built upon it. In the North-we&s;t End of the Town is the Foundation of a <HI>Roman</HI> Temple. Many <HI>Ro|man</HI> Coins have been found in the <HI>Borough-field,</HI> as they term the antient City, who&s;e Name was <HI>Cam|boritum,</HI> according to Dr. <HI>Stukely.</HI> In this Pari&s;h, they &s;ay, has been a Royal Manor. Not far off, by <HI>Audley-Inn,</HI> is a great <HI>Roman</HI> Camp, upon an Eminence, where now &s;tands an Hunting-tower of Brick.</P>
<P>A little North of this Part of the Country ri&s;es the River <HI>Stour,</HI> which, for a Cour&s;e of fifty Miles or more, parts the two Counties of <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>; pa&s;&s;ing thro' or near <HI>Haveril, Clare, Cavendi&s;h, Hal&s;ted, Sudbury, Buers, Nayland, Stretford, Ded|ham, Manningtree,</HI> and into the Sea at <HI>Harwich.</HI></P>
<P>As we came on this Side, we &s;aw at a Di&s;tance <HI>Braintree</HI> and <HI>Bocking,</HI> two large and populous Towns, which join together, being parted by a little Stream of Water. The&s;e were formerly very rich and flouri&s;hing, occa&s;ioned by the great Trade for Bays, which were manufactured in &s;uch Quantities in the&s;e two Towns, as to &s;end weekly to <HI>London</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="116">
Four, Five, or Six Waggons laden with them; but this Trade having greatly decrea&s;ed in a few Years, the Inhabitants are in a very mi&s;erable Condition at pre&s;ent; for by an Increa&s;e of their Poor, their Pari&s;h Rates are ri&s;en &s;o high, as in the Year 1738 the Poors Rate in <HI>Bocking</HI> Pari&s;h was Nine Shillings in the Pound; which, together with their other Rates and Taxes, rendered it very burden&s;ome to all the Inhabitants: and at the &s;ame time, the Small Pox having infe&s;ted both the Towns, their Markets were almo&s;t de&s;erted by the Country People. The Pari&s;h of <HI>Bocking</HI> is a Deanery, and the living is valued at upwards of 500<HI>l. per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>Near <HI>Braintree</HI> is the Pari&s;h of <HI>Black Notely,</HI> in which are a few &s;cattered Hou&s;es, &s;carcely worth noticing, except for the Memory of the late learned Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> who re&s;ided many Years in this Place, and was buried in the Church-yard, over who&s;e Grave a Monument was erected, with an In&s;cription in <HI>Latin</HI>; which being long, we &s;hall refer the Learned to the Original, and content our&s;elves with giving the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for the &s;ake of our common Readers, and in regard to &s;o great a Man, who was an Ho|nour to his Country. It may be thus rendered:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"The mortal Part of the mo&s;t learned <HI>John Ray,</HI> A. M. is depo&s;ited in this narrow Tomb; but his Writings are not confined to one Nation; and his Fame, every-where mo&s;t illu&s;trious, renders them immortal. Formerly he was Fellow of <HI>Trinity-College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and of the Royal Society in <HI>London,</HI> a &s;ingular Ornament of both. In every kind of Science, as well divine as human, mo&s;t expert. And, like a &s;econd <HI>Solomon,</HI> (to whom alone, perhaps, he was inferior) from the Cedar to the Hy&s;&s;op, from the large&s;t of Ani|mals to the &s;malle&s;t In&s;ects, he arrived at a con|&s;ummate Knowledge. And not only did he mo&s;t accurately di&s;cour&s;e of Plants &s;pread over the
<PB N="110" REF="117">
Face of the whole Earth; but, making a mo&s;t &s;trict Search, even into its inmo&s;t Bowels, what|ever de&s;erved Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion throughout all Nature, he de&s;crib'd. While on his Travels abroad, he dili|gently di&s;covered what had e&s;caped the Ob&s;ervation of others, and fir&s;t brought to Light many things mo&s;t worthy of Remark. Further than this, he was endowed with &s;o unaffected a manner of Behaviour, that he was learned without Pedant|ry; of a &s;ublime Genius, and at the &s;ame time (which is rarely known) of an humble and mode&s;t Di&s;po&s;ition. Not di&s;tingui&s;hed by an illu&s;trious Extraction; but (what is greater) by his own Virtue. Little &s;olicitous about obtaining Wealth and Titles, he cho&s;e rather to de&s;erve than to po&s;&s;e&s;s them. Content with his own Lot, he grew old in a private Station, worthy a more ample Fortune. In every other re&s;pect he readily ob&s;erved Moderation; in Study, none.</P><P>"To conclude: To all the&s;e Perfections he added a Piety free from Artifice; bearing an intire and hearty Veneration for the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which he confirmed with his la&s;t Breath. Thus, happily, in a virtuous Retirement, lived he, whom the pre&s;ent Age reveres, and Po&s;terity will admire."</P></Q></P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> This Monument beginning to want Repair, by &s;tanding expo&s;ed in the Church-yard, hath been lately removed, and &s;et up in the Chancel of <HI>Black Notely</HI> Church. To the former Epitaph is added, on the Table on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, a <HI>Latin</HI> In&s;cription, which may be thus rendered:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This Cenotaph, formerly expo&s;ed to the open Air in the Church-yard, defaced by the Injuries of the Weather, and ju&s;t falling into Ruins, was by <HI>J. Legge,</HI> M. D. repaired, and removed under Shelter, <HI>March</HI> 17. 1737."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="118">The Country hereabout is very plea&s;ant, having many Ri&s;ings and Falls, with great Plenty of Water. The Fields are well cultivated, &s;o as to render the whole Face of the Country like a Garden. But what is often very &s;urpri&s;ing to Strangers, is, the Nakedne&s;s of mo&s;t of the large Trees growing in their Hedge Rows, and on the Sides of the Road, even in the Month of <HI>May</HI>; at which time few of them have put out any Leaves; but, upon Inquiry, I found they were a peculiar Sort of Elm, which rarely puts out Leaves before the Middle of <HI>May</HI>; and this is one of the mo&s;t common Trees of this Country.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Braintree</HI> is <HI>Fel&s;ted,</HI> a &s;mall Place, but noted for a flouri&s;hing Free-School, of an antient Foundation.</P>
<P>Near to this is the Priory of <HI>Lees,</HI> which I men|tioned before (<HI>P.</HI> 20.); and hence keeping the <HI>Lon|don</HI> Road, I came to <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> mentioned al&s;o before, and <HI>Ingate&s;tone,</HI> five Miles We&s;t, which I mention again, as I promi&s;ed, (<HI>Pag.</HI> 20.) to have an Opportunity to &s;peak of the noble Family of Lord <HI>Petre,</HI> and of the Improvements making at his Seat near this Place, by the pre&s;ent Lord, who is a Noble|man of fine Ta&s;te, and great Qualities.</P>
<P><HI>Ingate&s;tone-hall,</HI> one of his Lord&s;hip's Seats, lies at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from the publick Road, on the Right-hand, about a Quarter of a Mile &s;hort of <HI>Ingate&s;tone</HI> Town.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e is &s;ituated very low, &s;o as not to be &s;een at a &s;mall Di&s;tance. It is a very large, irregular Building, and the Gardens are old; tho' there were many Alterations made in them for the better, by the pre&s;ent Lord, before he came of Age; but as this was not the Seat where he intended to re&s;ide, &s;o his Lord&s;hip did not employ his fine Genius in modelling of the&s;e Gardens; but his whole Thoughts were bent to embelli&s;h his noble Seat at <HI>Thorndon,</HI> which
<PB N="112" REF="119">
is &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing Ground, about three Miles on the Right-hand of <HI>Brentwood</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex:</HI> where his Lord&s;hip has been &s;ome Years laying of a Plan for a Hou&s;e and Gardens, which when executed, will be an Honour to the Nation.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e, when fini&s;hed, will be 265 Feet in Front, exclu&s;ive of the Offices. The principal Front is to the South-ea&s;t A&s;pect, where is de&s;igned a &s;pacious Court. Before this is de&s;igned a Ter|race-walk near 200 Feet broad, and of a great Length; on the other Side of this, will be a Lawn of Gra&s;s, containing near 200 Acres of Land, which is bounded by Plantations of Trees, and hand&s;ome Farms.</P>
<P>On the Back-front of the Hou&s;e is a noble Range of Stoves, for tender Exotick Plants; which when fini&s;hed will far exceed whatever has been done of this Nature, even by the greate&s;t Princes in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Park, which lies on the North-ea&s;t and North-we&s;t Side of the Hou&s;e, is very large, and well &s;tocked with Timber, which, fully grown, adds greatly to the Beauty of the Place. In many Parts of this Park are large Inclo&s;ures, which have been made by the pre&s;ent Lord, and are converted to Nur&s;eries, which are completely &s;tored with all Trees and Shrubs, that will live in the open Air in this Climate; &s;o that when the&s;e Trees are planted out, according to his Lord&s;hip's De&s;ign, it will be the mo&s;t beautiful and complete Plantation perhaps in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Thro' the Park there is already an Avenue cut, leading from <HI>Brentwood</HI> to the Hou&s;e, three Miles in Length; on each Side of it are de&s;igned Planta|tions of Trees, in regular Clumps, which, when fini&s;hed, will have a noble Effect, as People pa&s;s thro', up to the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="120">The Kitchen-garden is already fini&s;hed, and laid out with equal Elegance and U&s;efulne&s;s. This is &s;ituated behind the Offices, &s;o that it does not ap|pear in Sight from the Hou&s;e, and is detached from the other Gardens; and thereby is not expo&s;ed to Strangers, who may have Admittance to walk thro' the Plea&s;ure-garden and Plantations.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the whole Plan is the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and grand of any yet executed in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>In the Pari&s;h-church of <HI>Ingate&s;tone</HI> are to be &s;een the Monuments of his Lord&s;hip's Ance&s;tors, who by a con&s;tant Series of beneficent Actions to the Poor, and Bounty upon all charitable Occa&s;ions, gained to them&s;elves an affectionate E&s;teem thro' all that Part of the Country, &s;uch as no Prejudice ari&s;ing from a Difference in Religion could or ought to impair; for great and good Actions command our Re&s;pect, whatever the Opinions of the Donors may be.</P>
<P>From hence we cro&s;&s;ed the Country to the great Fore&s;t, called <HI>Epping Fore&s;t,</HI> reaching almo&s;t to <HI>Lon|don.</HI> The Country on that Side of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> is called the <HI>Roodings,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e becau&s;e there are no le&s;s than ten Towns almo&s;t together, called by the Name of <HI>Roding</HI>; and is famous for good Land, good Malt, and dirty Roads; the latter being in the Winter hardly pa&s;&s;able for Hor&s;e or Man. In the Mid&s;t of this we &s;ee <HI>Chipping Onger, Hatfield Broad-Oak, Epping,</HI> and many Fore&s;t-towns, famed al&s;o for Hu&s;bandry, and good Malt. On the South-&s;ide of the County is <HI>Waltham-abbey,</HI> which was formerly a Mona&s;tery, built by <HI>Harold</HI> Son to Earl <HI>Godwin,</HI> in Honour of the Cro&s;s. The Town is &s;aid to be built and peopled by one <HI>Tovius</HI> towards the Latter-end of the <HI>Saxons</HI> Reign. This Town is &s;eated on the River <HI>Lee,</HI> where the Streams, being divided, in|clo&s;e &s;everal &s;mall I&s;lands, which in times of great Floods are commonly overflowed: but the&s;e Meadows
<PB N="114" REF="121">
produce great Plenty of Gra&s;s in Summer, &s;o that here are many Dairy Farms which turn to good Account.</P>
<P>The Abbey is turned into a Seat, which is now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>---- Jones,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> The Gardens belonging to this Hou&s;e, were, &s;ome Years &s;ince, in great Repute; but &s;ince the Ta&s;te for inclo&s;ed Gardens has been condemned, they have been little frequented, unle&s;s by &s;ome curious Per&s;ons, to &s;ee the <HI>Tulip-tree,</HI> which grows on a Gra&s;s-plat near the Hou&s;e, and is one of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing of the Kind in <HI>England,</HI> producing annually a great Quantity of Flowers in the Month of <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>At this Abbey was bury'd the Body of King <HI>Harold,</HI> &s;lain in the great Battle in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> again&s;t <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> who&s;e Mother begged that Favour of <HI>the Conqueror</HI>; but no Monument was built for him, only a flat Grave-&s;tone, on which was &s;ignificantly engraven, <HI>Harold Infelix!</HI></P>
<P>From hence I came again over the Lower or We&s;tern Part of the Fore&s;t, where it is be&s;pangled with Villages, filled with fine Seats, mo&s;t of them built by Citizens of <HI>London</HI>; but the Lu&s;tre of them &s;eems to be intirely eclip&s;ed by the magnificent Palace of Earl <HI>Tilney,</HI> which I barely mentioned, (<HI>Pag.</HI> 3.) and intimated that I would touch upon it again; as I &s;hall now briefly do. This noble Seat was prepared by his Lord&s;hip's Father Sir <HI>Jo&s;iah Child,</HI> in his Life-time, who added to the Advantage of its Situation a va&s;t Number of Rows of Trees, planted in curious Order for Avenues and Vi&s;ta's, all leading up to the Spot of Ground where the old Hou&s;e &s;tood.</P>
<P>In the Place adjoining, the pre&s;ent Lord, before he was ennobled, and &s;ome Years before he began the Foundation of his new Hou&s;e, laid out the mo&s;t &s;pacious Pieces of fine Ground in Gardens, that are to be &s;een in this Part of <HI>England.</HI> The Green-hou&s;e
<PB N="115" REF="122">
is an excellent Building, fit to entertain a Prince; 'tis furni&s;hed with Stoves, and artificial Places for Heat, from an Apartment which has a Bagnio, and other Conveniencies, which render it both u&s;eful and plea&s;ant; and the&s;e Gardens have been &s;o much the Admiration of the Publick, that it has been the general Diver&s;ion of the Citizens to go out to &s;ee them, till the Crouds grew &s;o great, that his Lord&s;hip was obliged to re&s;train the &s;hewing them to particular and &s;tated Times.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e was built &s;ince the&s;e Gardens were fini&s;hed. It is all of <HI>Portland</HI> Stone in the Front, which gives it a mo&s;t magnificent Effect at a Di&s;tance; as the Nature of that Stone, except in <HI>London,</HI> where it is tinged with Smoke, is to grow whiter and whiter, the longer it &s;tands in the open Air.</P>
<P>As the Fore-front of the Hou&s;e looks through a long Row of Trees, reaching to the great Road at <HI>Leighton-&s;tone</HI>; &s;o the Back-front re&s;pects the Gar|dens, from which you fall down an ea&s;y De&s;cent, which lands you upon the Terrace, and gives a mo&s;t beautiful Pro&s;pect to the River, which is all formed into Canals and Openings, to an&s;wer the Views from above; and beyond the River, the Walks and Wilderne&s;&s;es go on to &s;uch a Di&s;tance, and in &s;uch a Manner, up the Hill, as they before went down, that the Sight is lo&s;t in the Woods adjoining, and it looks all like one continued planted Garden, as far as the Eye can &s;ee.</P>
<P>I have not Room in this Letter to &s;ay half what might be &s;aid of this truly noble Palace, nor for a particular De&s;cription of the beautiful Hou&s;e and Gardens erected at <HI>Low-Layton,</HI> by the late Sir <HI>Fi&s;her Tench</HI>; which the Duke <HI>d'Aumont,</HI> Emba&s;|&s;ador from <HI>France,</HI> about the Year 1711, &s;aid was one of the neate&s;t Boxes he had &s;een in <HI>Eng|land</HI>; and &s;o &s;hall ha&s;ten to conclude this Letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. CONTAINING A <HI>DESCRIPTION</HI> of the County of <HI>KENT,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I SHALL begin my Account of the famous County of <HI>Kent</HI> at <HI>Deptford.</HI> It was antiently called <HI>We&s;t-Greenwich,</HI> and is a very large Town, and of late &s;o very much improved, that a hand|&s;ome new Church has been built there, dedicated to St. <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P>Here was built, by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. a Store-hou&s;e, who al&s;o incorporated certain Officers by the Name of Ma&s;ter and Wardens of the <HI>Holy Trinity:</HI> The&s;e were to take care of the Building, Keeping and Conducting of the Royal Navy. Their Hall or Hou&s;e was adjoining to the Church: and the Trea|&s;urer of the Navy had al&s;o a convenient Hou&s;e at the Dock for his Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Here is a Foundation belonging to the &s;aid Cor|poration of <HI>Trinity-hou&s;e,</HI> by whom it was built at different Times, and in two Places, not quite con|tiguous. The old Part contains 21 Hou&s;es, the new 38, for decayed Pilots or Ma&s;ters of Ships,
<PB N="118" REF="125">
or the Widows of &s;uch; the Men are allowed 20<HI>s.</HI> the Women 16<HI>s. per</HI> Month.</P>
<P>But what <HI>Deptford</HI> is mo&s;t noted for, is its noble Dock, where the Royal Navy was u&s;ed to be built and repaired, till it was found more convenient to build the larger Ships at <HI>Woolwich,</HI> as I &s;hall men|tion in its Place: notwith&s;tanding which, the whole Area of the Yard is now inlarged to more than double what it formerly was: it has a wet Dock of Two Acres, for Ships, and another of an Acre and half, for Ma&s;ts; be&s;ides an Inlargement of its Store-hou&s;es, Dwelling-hou&s;es, Launches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;uitable to it.</P>
<P>Near the Dock is a Seat belonging to Sir <HI>John Evelyn,</HI> which is called <HI>Say's-court.</HI> This was ori|ginally in the Family of the <HI>Magmenots,</HI> who were <HI>Normans,</HI> one of whom was Lord Warden of the Ports, and Governor of <HI>Dover-ca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Red Hou&s;e</HI> at <HI>Deptford</HI> was a noted Collection of Warehou&s;es, and Storehou&s;es for many Sorts of Merchandizes, and particularly Hemp, Flax, Pitch, Tar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 5th of <HI>July</HI> 1739, a dreadful Fire broke out there, which con&s;umed the &s;ame. The Lo&s;s was incredible; for the Ma|terials were &s;o combu&s;tible, that nothing could be &s;aved, nor could the Flames be extingui&s;hed, till they had nothing to prey upon.</P>
<P>From <HI>Deptford</HI> I proceeded to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> one of the mo&s;t delightful Spots of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> The Park, in which is the fine Ob&s;ervatory called <HI>Flam|&s;tead-hou&s;e,</HI> from the late famous Mathematician of that Name, the Royal Hou&s;e, but more e&s;pecially the noble Ho&s;pital, de&s;erve particular Notice.</P>
<P>The Ground on which Part of this Ho&s;pital now &s;tands, is the &s;ame on which was formerly &s;ituated the Royal Palace of our Kings. Here <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. held his Fea&s;ts with Jou&s;ts and Tournaments; and the Ground, which was called the <HI>Tilt-yard,</HI> is
<PB N="119" REF="126">
the Spot on which the Ea&s;t Wing of the Ho&s;pital is built.</P>
<P>The Park was inlarged, walled about, and planted, by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. &s;oon after the Re&s;toration; and the De&s;ign or Plan of a Royal Palace was then laid out, one Wing of which was fini&s;hed in a magni|ficent Manner, and makes now the Fir&s;t Wing of the Ho&s;pital, towards <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The Royal Palace now remaining was originally built by <HI>Humphrey</HI> Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> &s;urnamed <HI>the Good,</HI> Brother of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and called by him <HI>Placentia.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. much inlarged it, added to it a &s;mall Hou&s;e of <HI>Friers-Mendicant,</HI> and fini&s;hed a Tower begun by Duke <HI>Humphrey</HI> on the Top of the Hill, where now &s;tands the Royal Ob&s;er|vatory; from which is a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect down to the winding River, and the green Meadows. It was completed by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and afterwards much inlarged and beautified by <HI>Henry Howard,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> who dwelt in it. Here Queen <HI>Mary</HI> and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> were born, and here died King <HI>Edward</HI> VI.</P>
<P>The Ho&s;pital was founded by King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> in the Year 1694, for the Relief of Seamen, their Widows, and Children, and Encou|ragement of Navigation. Three Tables are hung up at the Entrance into the Hall, which record the Names of &s;everal generous Benefactors to this noble Charity, amounting in the Whole to the Sum of 58,209<HI>l.</HI> And in the Year 1732, the forfeited E&s;tate of the late Earl of <HI>Derwentwater,</HI> (being, by means of the Right Honourable the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Gage,</HI> a Peer of <HI>Ireland,</HI> recovered out of the Hands of certain pri|vate Per&s;ons, who had purcha&s;ed the &s;ame at a Rate va&s;tly di&s;proportioned to the Value) amounting to near 6000<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> was given by Parliament to carry on and complete this Work; which will en|able them to pro&s;ecute it with Vigour and Succe&s;s;
<PB N="120" REF="127">
and accordingly they have made a great Progre&s;s &s;ince that time in the &s;econd Wing, and other Parts of this &s;umptuous Edifice.</P>
<P>The Hall is very noble, and finely painted by the late Sir <HI>James Thornhill.</HI> At the Upper-end of it, in an Alcove, are repre&s;ented the pre&s;ent Royal Family, the late Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia,</HI> King <HI>George</HI> I. King <HI>George</HI> II. and Queen <HI>Caroline,</HI> the Queen Dowager of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> the Duke, and the five Prince&s;&s;es. On the Ceiling, over the Alcove, are her late Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> and Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark.</HI> And on the Ceiling of the Hall, are King <HI>William,</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> with &s;everal fine em|blematical Figures.</P>
<P>On a Pede&s;tal in the Middle of the Area of the Ho&s;pital, fronting the <HI>Thames,</HI> is a Statue of his Maje&s;ty King <HI>George</HI> II.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1705, 100 di&s;abled Seamen were the fir&s;t that were received into this Ho&s;pital; but the pre&s;ent Number was made up in <HI>December</HI> 1737, a complete 1000. To each 100 Pen&s;ioners Six Nur&s;es are allowed, who are to be Seamens Widows, at 10<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and 2<HI>s. per</HI> Week more to tho&s;e who attend in the Infirmary. Their common Cloathing is Blue, with Bra&s;s Buttons.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Greenwich</HI> is a very hand&s;ome new-built Edifice, dedicated to St. <HI>Alphage,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who is &s;aid to have been killed by the <HI>Danes</HI> on the Spot where the Church &s;tands, <HI>Anno</HI> 1012.</P>
<P>There are two Free-Schools in this Pari&s;h, one founded by Sir <HI>William Boreman,</HI> Kt. The other was &s;et up by Mr. <HI>John Roan,</HI> who left his E&s;tate for Teaching Boys in Reading, Writing, and Arith|metick; allowing 2<HI>l. per Annum</HI> for each Boy's Cloaths: their Number is Twenty.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a hand&s;ome College in this Town, which fronts the River, for the Maintenance of
<PB N="121" REF="128">
Twenty poor Men and a Ma&s;ter, founded and well endowed by <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> and com|mitted by him to the Care of the Mercers Company of <HI>London.</HI> A Chapel belongs to this College, where the Earl's Body is laid, which, as well as his Monument, was removed hither a few Years ago, from the Chapel of <HI>Dover</HI> Ca&s;tle, whereof he was Con&s;table.</P>
<P>This Town may be &s;aid to be one of the genteele&s;t, as well as plea&s;ante&s;t, in <HI>England</HI>; the Inhabitants are many of them Per&s;ons of Note and Fa&s;hion, who have &s;erved abroad in the Fleets or Armies, and here pa&s;s the Remainder of their Days in Ea&s;e and Delight, having the Plea&s;ure to reflect upon the Dangers they have gone thro', and the faithful and honourable Parts they have acted on the publick Stage of Life, in their Country's Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>A Market was erected in the Year 1737, at this Town, the Direction of which is in the Governors of the Ho&s;pital; and the Profits which &s;hall ari&s;e from it, are to be carried to the U&s;e of that fine Foundation.</P>
<P>The River of <HI>Thames</HI> is here very broad, and the Chanel deep, and the Water at &s;ome very high Spring-tides is &s;alt; but in ordinary Tides, &s;weet and fre&s;h.</P>
<P>The Country behind <HI>Greenwich</HI> adds to the Plea|&s;ure of the Place: <HI>Black-heath,</HI> both for Beauty of Situation, and an excellent Air, is not out-done by any Spot of Ground in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Near this is a va&s;t Hill, u&s;ed as a Butt for Archers, and in great Reque&s;t among the neighbouring People, till King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Time; whence it took the Name of <HI>Shooters-hill.</HI></P>
<P>On the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Black-heath</HI> &s;tands the Ho&s;pital built by Sir <HI>John Morden,</HI> Bart. a <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchant. Several Years before his Death, which happened in 1708, he erected this &s;pacious Structure, in form of a
<PB N="122" REF="129">
College, &s;olely at his own Charge, in a Field called <HI>Great Stone Field,</HI> not far from his own Habitation, for the Reception of poor, decayed, hone&s;t Mer|chants, whereof in his Life-time he placed Twelve there. But by rea&s;on of great Lo&s;&s;es, they were reduced to Four in the Lady <HI>Morden</HI>'s Time, who was forced to retrench the Expences of the Hou&s;e, becau&s;e the Share allotted her by the la&s;t Will of Sir <HI>John,</HI> and &s;ome Parts of his E&s;tate, did not an&s;wer &s;o well as was expected.</P>
<P>When &s;he died, Sir <HI>John</HI>'s whole E&s;tate coming to the College, the Number was again increa&s;ed, and there are at this Time 35 poor Gentlemen in the Hou&s;e; and the Number not being limited, they are to be increa&s;ed as the E&s;tate will afford; for the Building was de&s;igned for, and will conveniently hold 40.</P>
<P>Seven <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchants have the Direction and Vi&s;itation of this Ho&s;pital, and the Nomination of the Per&s;ons to be admitted into it; and as often as any of the&s;e Seven die, the Survivors are to chu&s;e others to fill up that Number.</P>
<P>Every Trea&s;urer of this Ho&s;pital has 40<HI>l. per Annum.</HI> There is al&s;o a Chaplain, who is to read Prayers twice a Day in the Chapel, and to preach twice every <HI>Sunday.</HI> His Salary at fir&s;t was 30<HI>l.</HI> a Year; but the Lady <HI>Morden</HI> doubled it at her Death. She was in other re&s;pects a Benefactre&s;s to the College; and as &s;he put up her Hu&s;band's Statue in a Niche over the Gate of the College, the Tru&s;tees have al&s;o put up hers in another Niche adjoining to that of her Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The Pen&s;ion is 20<HI>l. per Annum</HI> each. At fir&s;t they wore Gowns, with the Founder's Badge; which they have not done for &s;ome Years.</P>
<P>The Chapel within the College is neatly wain-&s;cotted, and hath a co&s;tly Altar-piece, and it has a Burying-place adjoining, for the Members of the
<PB N="123" REF="130">
College. The Founder, according to his own De|&s;ire, was buried in a Vault under the Communion-table of this Chapel.</P>
<P>The Chaplain, the Trea&s;urer, the Merchants, are all indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to be re&s;ident there; and unle&s;s in ca&s;e of Sickne&s;s, no other Per&s;ons are to re&s;ide, live, or lodge there; and no Per&s;on is to be admitted as a Pen&s;ioner, who cannot bring a Certi|ficate to prove him&s;elf upwards of 60 Years of Age.</P>
<P>In a Word, as the Situation of the Place is plea&s;ant, the Air very good, and the Endowment very &s;uffi|cient, this may be &s;aid to be one of the mo&s;t com|fortable and elegant Pieces of Charity in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Near this College is the noble Hou&s;e, or rather Palace, of Sir <HI>Gregory Page,</HI> Bart. who&s;e Father was a Brewer at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> a few Years ago. It is one of the fine&s;t Seats in <HI>England,</HI> belonging to a private Gentleman; and the Park, Gardens, and Country round it, contribute to make it a mo&s;t de|lightful and truly noble Habitation.</P>
<P>It was begun and intirely rai&s;ed and covered in the Space of Eleven Months, which &s;hews how &s;oon a large Building may be fini&s;hed, where Money, the Sinews of Building, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is not wanting.</P>
<P>Over this Heath the famous <HI>Roman Watling-&s;treet</HI> ran, towards <HI>Shooters-hill</HI>; and &s;o on to <HI>Roche&s;ter, Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Dover.</HI> Here are great Numbers of &s;mall <HI>Tumuli,</HI> with &s;ome large and eminent ones, out of which Bones have been dug by the late learned Dr. <HI>Gale,</HI> (who re&s;ided many Years on this Heath) which &s;hew that many Per&s;ons of Eminence have been formerly buried here.</P>
<P>On this Heath the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Army lay a great while encamped, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1011; and many Trenches, and other Remains of the Lines of Camps, are &s;till vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>On the other Side of the Heath, North, is <HI>Charl|ton,</HI> a well-built plea&s;ant Village. The Church was
<PB N="124" REF="131">
beautified and repaired by Order of Sir <HI>Edward Newton,</HI> Bart. who was Tutor to King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t's Son, Prince <HI>Henry</HI>; and it is one of the fine&s;t Churches in this County.</P>
<P>At the Entrance of this Village, fronting <HI>Black-heath,</HI> &s;tands the antient Hou&s;e built by Sir <HI>Edward Newton,</HI> who had this Manor granted to him by King <HI>James</HI> I. It is a long Pile of Building in a <HI>Gothick</HI> Ta&s;te, having Four Turrets on the Top: the Court before the Hou&s;e is &s;pacious, at the Entrance of which are too large <HI>Gothick</HI> Piers to the Gates, and in a Line on the Out-&s;ide of the Wall is a long Row of <HI>Cypre&s;s Trees,</HI> which are &s;ome of the olde&s;t in <HI>England.</HI> On the Back of the Hou&s;e are large Gardens, remaining in the &s;ame Ta&s;te in which they were formerly laid out; and behind the&s;e is a &s;mall Park, which joins to <HI>Woolwich Common.</HI> This Hou&s;e is now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Earl of <HI>Egmont.</HI></P>
<P>Near the Church are two fine Hou&s;es, one of which was built by the late Lord <HI>Romney,</HI> who married a Daughter of Sir <HI>Cloude&s;ly Shovel</HI>; the other was in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the late Governor <HI>Hunter,</HI> before he went to <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Hou&s;es &s;tand on the Edge of the Hill, having their Gardens &s;loping down towards the River, which, tho' it renders the Pro&s;pect to the River very delightful in the Heat of Summer, yet as it expo&s;es their Gardens to the North Winds, their Fruit-trees are generally blighted; and in the Spring, when the Wind u&s;ually blows from the North, and Ea&s;t, the&s;e Gardens are &s;o much expo&s;ed to them, that it is very few Days, during that Sea&s;on, that Per&s;ons can walk with any Plea&s;ure in them.</P>
<P>It is true, that in the&s;e Gardens you have a large Reach of the River in View, &s;o that every Tide of Flood, a great Number of Ships are generally &s;ailing by to <HI>London</HI>; as in the Tide of Ebb, many are
<PB N="125" REF="132">
pa&s;&s;ing toward <HI>Grave&s;end</HI>; which affords a very de|lightful Sight, as it &s;hews the great Trade carried on by the Metropolis: yet as the Country on the other Side of the Water is a dead Flat for a great Number of Miles, and this often covered with Water in Winter, &s;o the Winds not only come very cold over this Flat, but al&s;o bring Fogs, Damps, and a very unwhol&s;ome Air with them, which greatly dimini&s;hes the Plea&s;ure of the&s;e Seats.</P>
<P><HI>Charlton</HI> is noted for the Fair held in its Neigh|bourhood on St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s-<HI>day, Octob.</HI> 18. called <HI>Horn-fair</HI>; the Rudene&s;s of which, in a civilized, well-governed Nation, may well be &s;aid to be un&s;ufferable. The Mob at that Time take all Kinds of Liberties, and the Women are e&s;pecially impudent that Day; as if it was a Day that ju&s;tified the giving them|&s;elves a Loo&s;e to all manner of Indecency with|out any Reproach, or without incurring the Cen|&s;ure which &s;uch Behaviour would de&s;erve at another time.</P>
<P>And this in a Circum&s;tance, which (far from be|ing to be gloried in) ought to be di&s;countenanced by the Sex, as fixing the Brand of Incontinence on too many of them, which they have little Rea&s;on to be proud of.</P>
<P>A vulgar Tradition gives the following Origin to this di&s;orderly Fair: It pretends to &s;ay, that one of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ome &s;ay, King <HI>John,</HI> who had a Palace in this Neighbourhood, at <HI>Eltham,</HI> being a hunting near <HI>Charlton,</HI> then a pitiful Ham|let only, and &s;eparated from his Attendants, entered into a Cottage, and found the Mi&s;tre&s;s of it alone; and &s;he being hand&s;ome, the King took a Liking to her, and having prevailed over her Mode&s;ty, ju&s;t in the critical Moment, her Hu&s;band came in; and vowing to kill them both, the King was forced to di&s;cover him&s;elf, and to compound with Gold for his Safety, giving him moreover all the Land from
<PB N="126" REF="133">
thence as far as the Place now called <HI>Cuckold's Point</HI>; and making him Ma&s;ter of the whole Hamlet, e&s;tabli&s;hed a Fair in favour of his new Deme&s;ne; and in Memory thereof, Horns, and Wares, and Toys of all Sorts made of Horn, are &s;old at this Fair.</P>
<P>Thro' this Town lies the Road to <HI>Woolwich,</HI> a Town &s;ituated on the Bank of the River, and wholly taken up by, and in a manner rai&s;ed from, the Yards and Works erected there for the Naval Service. For here, when the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Royal Navy in|crea&s;ed, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> built larger and greater Ships of War than were u&s;ually employed before, new Docks and Launches were erected, and Places prepared for the Building and Repairing Ships of the large&s;t Size; becau&s;e here was a greater Depth of Water, and a freer Chanel, than at <HI>Deptford.</HI></P>
<P>The Docks, Yards, and all the Buildings belong|ing to it, are encompa&s;&s;ed with a high Wall, and are exceeding &s;pacious and convenient; and &s;o prodigi|ou&s;ly full of all Sorts of Stores of Timber, Plank, Ma&s;ts, Pitch, Tar, and other Naval Provi&s;ions, as can hardly be calculated.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Building-yards, here is a large Rope|walk, where the bigge&s;t Cables are made for the Men of War; and on the Ea&s;t, or Lower-part of the Town, is the Gun-yard, commonly called the <HI>Park,</HI> or the <HI>Gun-park</HI>; where is a prodigious Quantity of Cannon of all Sorts for the Ships of War, every Ship's Guns apart; heavy Cannon for Batteries, and Mortars of all Sorts and Sizes; in&s;o|much that, as I was inform'd, here have been &s;ome|times laid up, at one Time, between &s;even and eight Thou&s;and Pieces of Ordnance, be&s;ides Mortars and Shells almo&s;t beyond Number.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o is the Hou&s;e where the Firemen and Engineers prepare their Fire-works, charge Bombs, Carca&s;&s;es, and Granadoes for the publick Service.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="134">Here is u&s;ually a Guard-&s;hip riding, e&s;pecially in time of War. The Town of late Years is much inlarged and beautified, &s;everal fine Docks, Rope|yards, and capacious Magazines added; and the Royal Foundery for Cannon repaired and improved. The <HI>Thames</HI> is here at high Water near a Mile over, and the Water &s;alt upon the Flood; and as the Chanel lies &s;trait Ea&s;t and We&s;t for about three Miles, the Tide runs very &s;trong, and the River is intirely free from Shoals and Sands, and has &s;even or eight Fathom Water; &s;o that the bigge&s;t Ships may ride here with Safety, even at low Water.</P>
<P>The Pari&s;h-church of <HI>Woolwich</HI> has been lately re|built as one of the Fifty new Churches, in a very hand&s;ome manner.</P>
<P>From this Town, till we come to <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> the whole Shore is low, and &s;pread with Mar&s;hes and unhealthy Grounds, except &s;ome few Intervals, where the Land bends inward, as at <HI>Erith, Green|hythe, North-fleet,</HI> &amp;c. in which Places the Chalk Hills almo&s;t join the River; and from thence the City of <HI>London,</HI> the adjacent Countries, and even <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> are &s;upplied with Lime, or with Chalk to make it.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Cliffs on the River-&s;ide, the Rubbi&s;h of the Chalk, which they mu&s;t be otherwi&s;e at the Charge of removing, is bought and fetched away by Lighters and Hoys, and carried to all the Forts and Creeks in the oppo&s;ite County of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and even to <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and &s;old there to the Farmers to lay upon their Land, which they do in prodigious Quantities; and are glad to give from 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> to 4<HI>s.</HI> a Load for it, according to the Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>This is the Practice in all the Creeks and Rivers in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> even to <HI>Malden, Colche&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>Na&s;e,</HI> and into <HI>Harwich</HI> Harbour up to <HI>Maningtree,</HI> and <HI>Ip&s;|wich</HI>; as al&s;o in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> to <HI>Aldborough, Orford, Dun|wich, Swold,</HI> and as high as <HI>Yarmouth</HI> in <HI>Norfolk.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="135">Thus the barren Soil of <HI>Kent</HI> (for &s;uch the chalky Grounds are e&s;teemed) make the &s;trong clayey Lands of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> rich and fruitful; and the Mixture of Earth forms a Compo&s;ition, which out of two barren Ex|tremes, makes one prolifick Medium.</P>
<P>Behind the&s;e mar&s;hy Grounds in <HI>Kent,</HI> at a &s;mall Di&s;tance, lies the Road from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Dover,</HI> on which, or near it, are &s;everal good Towns; for Example, <HI>Eltham,</HI> formerly a Royal Palace, when the Court was kept at <HI>Greenwich</HI>; and Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth,</HI> who (as before &s;aid) was born at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> was often carried to <HI>Eltham</HI> by her Nur&s;es, to draw in the whol&s;ome Air of that agreeable Place; but at pre&s;ent there are few or no Signs of the old Palace to be &s;een.</P>
<P>It is now however a plea&s;ant Town, very hand|&s;omely built, full of good Hou&s;es; and many Fa|milies of rich Citizens inhabit there, who bring a great deal of good Company with them.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Eltham</HI> lies <HI>Che&s;ilhur&s;t,</HI> where is the Bury|ing-place of the Family of the <HI>Wal&s;inghams,</HI> who re&s;ided in this Pari&s;h for &s;everal Generations.</P>
<P>In this Pari&s;h is an antient Seat called <HI>Frog-pool,</HI> or <HI>Fragnall,</HI> which in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. was in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Thomas le Barbur,</HI> who in the 38th Year of the late King's Reign, had a Charter of <HI>Free-Warren</HI> for his Lands here. This Seat is now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Tryon,</HI> a Merchant of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>This Village is famous for the Retirement of the famous Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> who re&s;ided here for &s;everal Years, and here compo&s;ed the greate&s;t Part of his <HI>Annals of Queen</HI> Elizabeth.</P>
<P>Near this are &s;everal other Towns and Villages, as <HI>Bexley, Crayford, Wilmington, Foots-cray, North-cray,</HI> &amp;c. which being Places of little Note, I &s;hall pa&s;s over with only ob&s;erving, that about the&s;e Vil|lages are many Woods, chiefly of <HI>Birch,</HI> from whence
<PB N="129" REF="136">
the Broom-makers in <HI>Kent-&s;treet, Southwark,</HI> are &s;upplied with their Birch, which bring in a con&s;ider|able Profit to the Land-owners.</P>
<P>From this Side of the Country, all plea&s;ant and gay, we go over <HI>Shooter's-hill,</HI> where the Face of Things &s;eems quite altered; for here we have but a chalky Soil, and far from rich; much overgrown with Coppice-wood, which is cut for Faggots and Bavins, and &s;ent up by Water to <HI>London.</HI> Here they make tho&s;e Faggots which the Wood-mongers call O&s;trey-wood, and in particular tho&s;e &s;mall light Bavins which are u&s;ed in Taverns in <HI>London</HI> to light their Faggots, and are called in the Taverns a <HI>Bru&s;h,</HI> and by the Wood-men <HI>Pimps.</HI> 'Tis incredible what va&s;t Quantities of the&s;e u&s;ed to be laid up at <HI>Wool|wich, Erith,</HI> and <HI>Dartford</HI>; but &s;ince the Taverns in <HI>London</HI> are come to make Coal-fires in their upper Rooms, that Trade declines; and tho' that Article would &s;eem to be trifling in it&s;elf, 'tis not immate|rial to ob&s;erve what an Alteration it makes in the Value of tho&s;e Woods in <HI>Kent,</HI> and how many more of them than u&s;ual are yearly grubbed up, and the Land made fit for the Plough.</P>
<P>In <HI>July</HI> 1739, a very good De&s;ign was begun to be put in Execution on <HI>Shooters-hill,</HI> a Number of Hands being employ'd in cutting a new Road, wide enough for three Carriages to pa&s;s abrea&s;t on the Ea&s;tern De&s;cent of the Hill, which was formerly &s;o narrow that it was impo&s;&s;ible for a Pa&s;&s;enger, if way-laid, to e&s;cape falling into a Ruffian's Hands, and which gave Occa&s;ion to many Robberies being committed here.</P>
<P><HI>Dartford</HI> is a hand&s;ome large Town, having many good Hou&s;es in it, and is finely watered by two or three very good Springs; the River goes thro' the Town, and di&s;charges it&s;elf into the <HI>Thames.</HI> On this River the fir&s;t <HI>Paper-mill</HI> in <HI>England</HI> was built, by Sir <HI>John Spillman,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I.
<PB N="130" REF="137">
who granted him a Patent, with a Salary of 200<HI>l. per Annum</HI> for his Encouragement.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Mill al&s;o for Slitting of Bars of Iron for making of Wire, was on this River.</P>
<P>There are two Church-yards here, one about the Church, and the other on the Top of the Hill to|wards <HI>North-fleet</HI>; in the latter of which you may look over the Tower of the Church, the Ground ri&s;ing &s;uddenly &s;o very high.</P>
<P>Here is a very good Market for Corn on <HI>Satur|days,</HI> and an annual Fair on the 22d of <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 31. 1737-8, the Powder-mill at <HI>Dart|ford</HI> blew up, with this remarkable Circum&s;tance, That tho' all the Servants were about their re&s;pective Employments, not one of them received any Hurt. And it is further remarkable, that within eight Years, this is the fourth Time that this Mill has been blown up, and no Damage done by the Di&s;a&s;ter to the Per&s;ons of the People belonging to it.</P>
<P><HI>Grave&s;end</HI> lies on the North-&s;ide of <HI>Kent,</HI> on the River <HI>Thames,</HI> about &s;ix Miles North-ea&s;t from <HI>Dartford,</HI> and about the &s;ame Di&s;tance from <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI> The Town of <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI> were incorpo|rated in the 10th Year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> by the Name of the <HI>Port-Reeve,</HI> Jurats and Inhabitants of the Towns of <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> and <HI>Milton.</HI> As this Place is the mo&s;t frequented Pa&s;&s;age of taking Boat for <HI>London,</HI> by Per&s;ons who come from <HI>Dover, Roche&s;ter, &amp;c.</HI> or thro' any Part of <HI>Kent,</HI> from foreign Parts, &s;o Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> ordered the Mayor, Aldermen, and Companies of the City of <HI>London,</HI> to receive all eminent Strangers and Emba&s;&s;adors here, in their Formalities, and &s;o to attend them to <HI>London</HI> in their Barges, if they came up by Water: and if they came by Land, they were ordered to meet them on <HI>Black-heath,</HI> on Hor&s;e-back, in their Gowns. So much did that wi&s;e Queen con&s;ult the Honour and Grandeur of the City!</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="138">King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. rai&s;ed here a Platform of Guns, and another at <HI>Milton,</HI> as well as two others over-again&s;t them on the <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Side, for the Security of the River. But &s;ince the Erection of <HI>Tilbury-fort,</HI> the&s;e have been demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the Year 1380, this Town was burnt by the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Galleys, and the Enemies carried away mo&s;t of the Inhabitants Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Here is a very hand&s;ome Charity, given by one Mr. <HI>Henry Pinnock,</HI> in the Year 1624, of 21 Dwel|lings, and a Hou&s;e for a Ma&s;ter Weaver to employ the Poor: And a good E&s;tate is al&s;o &s;ettled for the Repairs.</P>
<P>In this Town, on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, is &s;till &s;tanding the Body of an antient Chapel, which &s;eems to have belonged to &s;ome Religious Hou&s;e, for Places in the Walls of the Vault remain &s;till for Holy Water. A Market is kept here on <HI>Wedne&s;days</HI> and <HI>Saturdays,</HI> and an annual Fair on the 13th of <HI>October,</HI> which la&s;ts a Week.</P>
<P>There have been very great Improvements made of the Lands near this Town within a few Years pa&s;t, by turning them into Kitchen-gardens, the Land being fre&s;h for this Purpo&s;e, as al&s;o pretty moi&s;t, and the Town having good Quantity of Dung made in it, with which they manure the Land: it pro|duces very good Garden-&s;tuff in great Plenty, wherewith they not only &s;upply the Towns for &s;everal Miles round, but al&s;o &s;end great Quantities to the <HI>London</HI> Markets; particularly <HI>A&s;paragus,</HI> which is &s;o much e&s;teemed, that the Name of <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> will bring a better Price than what is brought from any other Place, this having obtained a much greater Reputation than <HI>Batter&s;ea,</HI> which was &s;ome Years &s;ince famous for <HI>A&s;paragus.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> is the great Ferry (as they call it) between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t-Kent.</HI> It is hardly credible what Numbers of People pa&s;s here every Tide, as

well by Night as by Day, between this Town and <HI>London.</HI> Almo&s;t all the People of <HI>Ea&s;t-Kent,</HI> when they go for <HI>London,</HI> go no farther by Land than this Town; and then for 6<HI>d.</HI> in the Tilt-boat, or 1<HI>s.</HI> in a &s;mall Boat or Wherry, are carried to <HI>London</HI> by Water.</P>
<P>Another Thing for which this Town is worth notice, is, that all the Ships which go to Sea from <HI>London,</HI> take, as we &s;ay, their Departure from hence; for here all outward-bound Ships mu&s;t &s;top, come to an Anchor, and &s;uffer what they call a &s;econd Clear|ing; <HI>(viz.)</HI> here a Searcher of the Cu&s;toms comes on board, looks over all the Coquets or Entries of the Cargo, and may, if he plea&s;es, romage the whole Lading, to &s;ee if there are any more Goods than are entered; which however they &s;eldom do, tho' they forget not to take a Compliment for their Civility, and be&s;ides being well treated on board, have gene|rally Three or Five Guns fired in Honour to them, when they go off.</P>
<P>The Method of cau&s;ing all Ships to &s;top here is worth ob&s;erving, and is as follows:</P>
<P>When a Merchant-&s;hip comes down from <HI>Lon|don,</HI> (if they have the Tide of Ebb under Foot, or a fre&s;h Gale of Wind from the We&s;t, &s;o that they have what they call Fre&s;h-way, and the Ships come down apace) they generally hand &s;ome of their Sails, haul up a Fore-&s;ail or Main-&s;ail, or lower the Fore|top-&s;ail, &s;o to &s;lacken her Way, as &s;oon as they come to the <HI>Old Man's Head</HI>; when they open the Reach, which they call <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> Reach, which begins about a Mile and half above the Town, they do the like, to &s;ignify that they intend to bring to, as the Sailors call it, and come to an Anchor.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they come among the Ships that are in the Road, (as there are always a great many) the Centinel at the Block-hou&s;e on <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> Side fires his Mu&s;ket, which is to tell the Pilot he mu&s;t <HI>bring</HI> <PB N="133" REF="140">
<HI>to</HI>; if he comes on, as &s;oon as the Ship pa&s;&s;es Broad-&s;ide with the Block-hou&s;e, the Centinel fires again, which is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>Why don't you bring to?</HI> If he drives a little farther, he fires a third time, and the Language of that is, <HI>Bring to immediately, and let go your Anchor, or we will make you.</HI></P>
<P>If the Ship continues to drive down, and does not let go her Anchor, the Gunner of the Fort is call'd; and he fires a Piece of Cannon, tho' without Ball; and that is &s;till a Threat, tho' with &s;ome Patience, and is to &s;ay, <HI>Will you come to an Anchor, or will you not?</HI> If he &s;till ventures to go on, by which he gives them to under&s;tand he intends to run for it, then the Gunner fires again, and with a Shot; and that Shot is a Signal to the Fortre&s;s over the River, <HI>viz. Tilbury Fort,</HI> (which I de&s;crib'd in my Account of <HI>E&s;&s;ex, p.</HI> 5.) and they immediately let fly at the Ship from the Guns on the Ea&s;t Ba&s;tion, and after from all the Guns they can bring to bear upon her: It is very &s;eldom that a Ship will venture their Shot, becau&s;e they can reach her all the Way to the <HI>Hope,</HI> and round the <HI>Hope-Point</HI> almo&s;t to <HI>Hole-Haven</HI>; tho' 'tis &s;aid, this has been done once or twice: but the Oc|ca&s;ion mu&s;t be very extraordinary to make a Ship run the Ri&s;que. As for Ships coming in, they all go by here without any Notice taken of them, unle&s;s it be to put Waiters on board, if they are not &s;upply'd be|fore.</P>
<P>On the 24th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1727, a dreadful Fire happen'd here, which burnt down and de&s;troyed the Church, and the greate&s;t Part of the Town; and in 1731, an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed for rebuilding the Church, as one of the Fifty new ones; and the Town too, being mo&s;tly rebuilt, makes a better Appearance for the Calamity it underwent.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;age to and from <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> to <HI>London</HI> is now made more commodious and &s;afe for Pa&s;&s;engers than before, by Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed in 1736-7,
<PB N="134" REF="141">
for regulating the Company of Watermen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be|tween <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> and <HI>Wind&s;or</HI>; which limits the Number of Pa&s;&s;engers to Forty at the mo&s;t, on board the Tilt-boats, and Ten at mo&s;t by the Wherries; di|rects the Burden of the &s;aid Boats; prohibits clo&s;e Decks and Bails nailed down in the Wherries; pre|&s;cribes the Times of Departure of the Tilt-boats and Wherries, and the Age of the Watermen navigating the &s;aid Boats, and directs a Puni&s;hment again&s;t &s;uch Wa|termen as wilfully lo&s;e their Tide, or &s;et the Pa&s;&s;en|gers on Shore two Miles &s;hort of the Place to which they are bound. And the Rulers of the Watermens Company are thereby obliged to provide Officers at <HI>Billin&s;gate,</HI> and at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> who, as near as is po&s;&s;ible, Night and Day, at every Time of High-Water, and fir&s;t of Flood, are, at the re&s;pective Places, to ring publickly a Bell &s;et up for that Pur|po&s;e, for Fifteen Minutes, to give Notice to the Tilt|boats and Wherries to put off, and make the be&s;t of their Way, without lying by, or putting on Shore, being within two Miles of their re&s;pective Ports. Which excellent Provi&s;ions mu&s;t be a great Ea&s;e and Safety to all Per&s;ons who are obliged to u&s;e this Pa&s;|&s;age.</P>
<P>A remarkable Occurrence happening the la&s;t Time I was at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> de&s;erves to be mentioned here in Honour to a brave and excellent <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mariner. The Ca&s;e was thus:</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday, December</HI> 16. 1738, the Ship <HI>Anne</HI> and <HI>Thomas,</HI> Captain <HI>Ogilvie,</HI> Commander, outward-bound for <HI>Africa,</HI> lying at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> was, by the boiling over of a Kettle of Pitch, &s;et on Fire: to ex|tingui&s;h which, the Crew at fir&s;t made an Attempt; but finding the Flames increa&s;e upon them, they were all upon the Point of leaving her, for Fear of 100 Bar|rels of Gunpowder which were on board: when hap|pily the Mate, returning from a Vi&s;it he had been making to a Brother Officer of a neighbouring Ship,
<PB N="135" REF="142">
&s;topp'd their De&s;ign, and with a noble Re&s;olution, cutting the Boats clear of the Ship, told them they had no Means left to e&s;cape peri&s;hing, either by Fire or Water, but by heartily joining their Endeavours to extingui&s;h the Flames. When they found them&s;elves in &s;o bad a Dilemma, they unanimou&s;ly attempted it, and after &s;ome time providentially got it under, to the no &s;mall Joy of the Town of <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> as well as of all the Ships near them, who were in the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation for Fear of the Gunpowder, and every Moment in Expectation of the terrible Blow.</P>
<P>We &s;ee nothing remarkable on the Road hereabouts but <HI>Gad</HI>'s-<HI>Hill,</HI> a noted Place for robbing of Seamen, after they have received their Pay at <HI>Chatham.</HI> Here it was that a famous Robbery was committed in or about the Year 1676, which de&s;erves to be men|tioned: It was about Four o'Clock in the Morning, when a Gentleman was robb'd by one <HI>Nicks</HI> on a Bay Mare, ju&s;t on the Declivity of the Hill, on the We&s;t Side. <HI>Nicks</HI> came away to <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and, as he &s;aid, was &s;topp'd by the Difficulty of getting the Boat, near an Hour, which was a great Di&s;couragement to him; but he made the be&s;t U&s;e of it, as a kind of Bait to his Hor&s;e: from thence he rode cro&s;s the County of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> to <HI>Chelmsford:</HI> here he &s;topp'd about half an Hour to refre&s;h his Hor&s;e, and gave him &s;ome Balls; from thence to <HI>Braintree, Bocking, Wethersfield</HI>; then over the Downs to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and from thence, keeping &s;till the cro&s;s Roads, he went by <HI>Fenny Stratford</HI> to <HI>Godmanche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> where he baited him&s;elf and his Mare about an Hour; and, as he &s;aid him&s;elf, &s;lept about half an Hour; then hold|ing on the North Road, and keeping a full Gallop mo&s;t of the Way, he came to <HI>York</HI> the &s;ame After|noon; put off his Boots and riding Cloaths, and went dre&s;s'd as if he had been an Inhabitant of the Place, to the Bowling-green, where, among other Gentlemen, was the Lord-Mayor of the City. He, &s;ingling out
<PB N="136" REF="143">
his Lord&s;hip, &s;tudied to do &s;omething particular, that the Mayor might remember him by; and then takes Occa&s;ion to a&s;k his Lord&s;hip what o'Clock it was, who pulling out his Watch, told him the Hour, which was a Quarter before, or a Quarter after Eight at Night.</P>
<P>Upon a Pro&s;ecution for this Robbery, the whole Merit of the Ca&s;e turn'd upon this &s;ingle Point; the Per&s;on robb'd &s;wore to the Man, to the Place, and to the Time, in which the Fact was committed; but <HI>Nicks,</HI> proving by the Lord-Mayor, that he was as far off as <HI>York&s;hire</HI> at that Time, the Jury acquitted him on a bare Suppo&s;ition, that it was impo&s;&s;ible the Man could be at two Places &s;o remote, on one and the &s;ame Day.</P>
<P>On the Road from <HI>Gad</HI>'s-<HI>Hill</HI> to <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> are very large Cherry-Orchards, e&s;pecially on the Right|hand of the Road: the&s;e Cherries are &s;ent up to <HI>Lon|don</HI> in Hoys, and were formerly a great Branch of Trade to the Land-owners of this Country; but of late Years there has been &s;uch Plenty of this Fruit, that they have &s;carce paid for gathering and &s;ending to <HI>London,</HI> which has occa&s;ioned many of the Owners of the&s;e Orchards to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>From <HI>Gad</HI>'s-<HI>Hill</HI> we come to <HI>Roche&s;ter-Bridge,</HI> the longe&s;t, highe&s;t, and the &s;tronge&s;t built of all the Bridges in <HI>England,</HI> except that of <HI>London.</HI> Some indeed &s;ay, the Bridge of <HI>Newca&s;tle upon Tyne</HI> ex|ceeds all the Bridges in <HI>England</HI> for Strength; but then it is neither &s;o high, nor &s;o long, as this at <HI>Ro|che&s;ter.</HI> It is &s;upported by eleven Arches, and was built by Sir <HI>Robert Knowles</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and railed in with Iron at the Charge of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Warham.</HI></P>
<P>The River <HI>Medway,</HI> at this Place, is very broad and rapid, foaming mo&s;t violently. <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> was the <HI>Roman</HI> City <HI>Durobrivis,</HI> and was very &s;trong, be|ing wall'd about and ditch'd. Many Antiquities have
<PB N="137" REF="144">
been found hereabouts. This City &s;tands in an An|gle of the River, and &s;eems to have been of a &s;quare Form, the <HI>Watling-&s;treet</HI> running directly thro' it. Mo&s;t of the Walls &s;till remain; and a large Piece of the <HI>Roman</HI> Wall, made of Rubble-&s;tone laid &s;loping &s;ide-ways, is to be &s;een near that Angle below the Bridge, encompa&s;&s;ed by the River with <HI>Roman</HI> Bricks in &s;everal Places.</P>
<P><HI>Roche&s;ter, Stroud,</HI> and <HI>Chatham,</HI> are three di|&s;tinct Places, but in a manner contiguous.</P>
<P><HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> has &s;uffer'd very much by Fire and War. It con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of a large ill-built broad Street. <HI>Stroud</HI> is &s;eparated from it only by a Bridge, and may alone pa&s;s for a &s;mall City, and is well-built, but has nothing very remarkable in it.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> was erected by King <HI>Wil|liam</HI> I. out of one Angle of the River. The Walls of the great Tower now left, are four Yards thick. The Body of the Cathedral is of the original Stru|cture before the Conque&s;t, and repair'd by Bi&s;hop <HI>Gun|dulph,</HI> an Architect, who likewi&s;e built the Ca&s;tle. The great Tower is call'd <HI>Gundulph</HI>'s <HI>Tower.</HI> The chalky Cliff under the Ca&s;tle Wall, next the River, is a romantick Sight. The Rapidity of the Stream wa&s;tes it away, and then huge Tracts of the Wall fall down. On the North Side of the North-we&s;t Tower of the Church is <HI>Gundulph</HI>'s Effigies. The Front of the Church is of the old Work, but a new Window put in the Middle. The Ea&s;tern Gate of the City was pull'd down not very long ago, the Stones of which were of a <HI>Roman</HI> Cut. The Town-hou&s;e and Charity-&s;chool are two of the be&s;t pub|lick Buildings in <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Stroud,</HI> except the Churches.</P>
<P>But <HI>Chatham</HI> being the chief Ar&s;enal of the Royal Navy of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Kind in the World. The private Buildings, as the Hou&s;es of the Sea-Officers, Directors, In&s;pect|ors,
<PB N="138" REF="145">
and Workmen belonging to the Royal Navy, are well-built, and many of them &s;tately. But the publick Edifices there are indeed, like the Ships them&s;elves, &s;urpri&s;ingly large, and in their &s;everal Kinds beautiful. The Ware-hou&s;es, or rather Streets of Ware-hou&s;es, and Store-hou&s;es for laying up the Naval Trea&s;ure, are the large&s;t in Dimen&s;ion, and the mo&s;t in Number, that are any-where to be &s;een in the World. The Rope-walks for making Cables, and the Forges for Anchors and other Iron-work, bear a Proportion to the re&s;t; as al&s;o the Wet-dock, Canals, and Ditches, for keeping Ma&s;ts and Yards of the greate&s;t Size, where they lie &s;unk in the Wa|ter to pre&s;erve them: The Boat-yard, Rope-yards, the Anchor-yard, Forges, Founderies, all not ea&s;y to be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>We come next to the Stores them&s;elves, for which all this Provi&s;ion is made; and fir&s;t, to begin with the Ships that are laid up there: The Sails, the Rig|ging, the Ammunition, Guns, great and &s;mall Shot, &s;mall Arms, Swords, Cutla&s;&s;es, Half-pikes, with all the other Furniture belonging to the Ships that ride at their Moorings in the River <HI>Medway,</HI> Powder excepted, which is generally carried to particular Ma|gazines, to avoid Di&s;a&s;ter, all the&s;e Stores are re|po&s;ited in &s;eparate Buildings and Store-hou&s;es appro|priated for the Furniture of every Ship, and may be taken out on the mo&s;t emergent Occa&s;ion, without Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, are Ware-hou&s;es for laying up the Furniture, and Stores for Ships in general, and for the furni&s;hing other Ships to be built, or for repair|ing and &s;upplying the Ships already there, as Occa|&s;ion may require.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e there are &s;eparate and re&s;pective Magazines of Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax, Tow, Re&s;in, Oil, Tallow; al&s;o of Sail-cloth, Canvas, Cables, &s;tanding and running Rigging, ready fitted, and Cor|dage
<PB N="139" REF="146">
not fitted; with all Kinds of Ship-chandlery Nece&s;&s;aries, &s;uch as Blocks, Tackles, Runners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the Cooks, Boat&s;wains, and Gunners Stores, and al&s;o Anchors of all Sizes, Grapnells, Chains, Bolts, and Spikes, wrought and unwrought Iron, Ca&s;t-Iron Work, &s;uch as Pots, Caldrons, Fur|naces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> al&s;o Boats, &s;pare Ma&s;ts and Yards, with a great Quantity of Lead and Nails, and other Ne|ce&s;&s;aries, too many to be enumerated.</P>
<P>To ob&s;erve the&s;e Things deliberately, one would almo&s;t wonder what Ships they were, and where they &s;hould be found, which could either for Building or Repairing, Fitting or Refitting, call for &s;uch a Quan|tity of all the&s;e Things; but when, on the other hand, one &s;ees the Ships, and con&s;iders their Dimen|&s;ions, and con&s;equently the Dimen&s;ions of all Things which belong to them; how large, how &s;trong every thing mu&s;t be; how much of the Materials mu&s;t go to the making every thing proportionable to the Oc|ca&s;ion, the Wonder would change its Pro&s;pect, and one would be as much amazed to think how and where they &s;hould be &s;upply'd.</P>
<P>The particular Government of the&s;e Yards is very remarkable, the Commi&s;&s;ioners, Clerks, Accomp|tants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> within Doors; the Store-keepers, Yard-keepers, Dock-keepers, Watchmen, and all other Officers without Doors, with the Subordination of all Officers one to another re&s;pectively, as their De|grees and Offices require. The Watchmen are &s;et duly every Night at &s;tated and certain Places within the &s;everal Yards, with every one a Bell over his Head, which they ring or toll every Hour, giving &s;o many Strokes as the Hour reckons; and then one taking it from another through every Part of the Yard, and of all the Yards, makes the Watch be perform'd in a very exact and regular manner. In the River is a Guard-boat, which, like the Main-guard in a Gari&s;on, rows the Grand Rounds at cer|tain
<PB N="140" REF="147">
Times, by every Ship in the River, to &s;ee that the People on board are at their Po&s;t: If the Man placed to look out in each Ship, does not call, <HI>Who comes there?</HI> the Guard-boat boards it immediately, to examine into the Defect of Duty.</P>
<P>The Expedition that has been &s;ometimes u&s;ed here in fitting out Men of War, is &s;carce credible; for the Workmen told us, That the <HI>Royal Sovereign,</HI> a Fir&s;t Rate of 106 Guns, was riding at her Moorings, intirely unrigg'd, and nothing but her three Ma&s;ts &s;tanding, as is u&s;ual when a Ship is laid up; and that &s;he was completely rigg'd, all her Ma&s;ts up, her Yards put to, her Sails bent, Anchors and Cables on board, and the Ship &s;ailed down to <HI>Black-Stakes</HI> in Three Days, Sir <HI>Cloude&s;ly Shovell</HI> being then her Captain.</P>
<P>I do not vouch the Thing; but when I con&s;ider, fir&s;t, that every thing lay ready in her Store-hou&s;es, and wanted nothing but to be brought out and car|ried on Board; a Thou&s;and or Fifteen hundred Men to be employ'd in it, and more, if they were wanted; and every Man knowing his Bu&s;ine&s;s perfectly well; Boats, Carriages, Pullies, Tackles, Cranes, and Hulk all ready; I do not know but it might be done in one Day, if it was tried. Certain it is, the Dexterity of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sailors in tho&s;e things is not to be matched by any in the World.</P>
<P>The Building-yards, Docks, Timber-yard, Deal-yard, Ma&s;t-yard, Gun-yard, Rope-walks, and all the other Yards and Places &s;et apart for the Works belonging to the Navy, are like a well-order'd City; and tho' you &s;ee the whole Place, as it were, in the utmo&s;t Hurry, yet you &s;ee no Confu&s;ion; every Man knows his own Bu&s;ine&s;s; the Ma&s;ter-builders appoint the Working or Converting, as they call it, of every Piece of Timber, and give to the other Head-work|men or Foremen, their Moulds for the &s;quaring and cutting out of every Piece, and placing it in its pro|per Byrth (&s;o they call it) in the Ship that is in
<PB N="241" REF="148">
Building; and every Hand is bu&s;y in pur&s;uing tho&s;e Directions, and &s;o in all the other Works.</P>
<P><HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> has a Market on <HI>Fridays,</HI> and it hath, by Grant from King <HI>Henry</HI> I. two annual Fairs, <HI>viz. May</HI> the 19th, and <HI>Nov.</HI> the 30th. The Ground on that Side of the Town next the River is very low and mar&s;hy, being overflowed by every high Tide, which renders the Situation unplea&s;ant, and the Air unwhol&s;ome, from the Vapours which ari&s;e from the&s;e &s;alt Mar&s;hes.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s in this Place to take Notice, that there is in the River <HI>Medway,</HI> at <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and in &s;everal of its Creeks and Branches within the Ju|ri&s;diction of the City, an Oy&s;ter-Fi&s;hery, which is free to every one who has &s;erved Seven Years Appren|tice&s;hip to any Fi&s;herman or Dredger, who is free of the &s;aid Fi&s;hery; and the Mayor and Citizens of <HI>Ro|che&s;ter</HI> hold a Court, commonly call'd <HI>An Admiralty-Court,</HI> once a Year, or oftener, when Occa&s;ions have required it, for the regulating of the &s;aid Fi&s;hery, and to prevent Abu&s;es committed in it. In the&s;e Courts they appoint, from Time to Time, when Oy&s;ters &s;hall and &s;hall not be dredged and taken, which they call <HI>Opening and Shutting the Grounds</HI>; after the Quantity each Dredgerman &s;hall take in a Day, which is u&s;ually called <HI>Setting the Stint.</HI> They have a Power to go on board, and enforce the&s;e Orders; and when they have found them not duly ob&s;erved, or that the <HI>Brood</HI> or <HI>Spat</HI> has been taken which &s;hould have been pre&s;erved, they &s;eize and throw into the River and Creeks the <HI>Brood,</HI> or &s;uch Oy&s;ters as have ex|ceeded the pre&s;cribed Quantity.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who dredge or fi&s;h for Oy&s;ters, not being Free of the Fi&s;hery, are called <HI>Cable-hangers,</HI> and are pre&s;ented and puni&s;hed by the Court. Every li|cen&s;ed Dredger pays &s;ix Shillings and Eight-pence yearly to the Support of the Courts. But &s;everal licen|tious Per&s;ons having, in Proce&s;s of Time, conte&s;ted
<PB N="142" REF="149">
the Authority of this Court, and great Inconveniences ari&s;ing from it, to the endangering the Fi&s;hery, and to the De&s;truction of all good Order and Rule, the Cor|poration and Free Dredgermen apply'd to Parliament, and an Act pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>Anno</HI> 1729, e&s;tabli&s;hing the Juri&s;|diction of the City of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and enforcing the Au|thority of the &s;aid Courts; and &s;ince that another Act explaining and &s;upplying Defects; &s;o that at pre&s;ent this Fi&s;hery is in a flouri&s;hing Condition, and all the fair Dealers in this Commodity find their Account in it.</P>
<P>It is about &s;ixteen or eighteen Miles from <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> Bridge to <HI>Sheerne&s;s</HI> Fort by Water, on the River <HI>Medway</HI>; of this it is about fourteen Miles to <HI>Black-&s;takes</HI>; the Chanel is &s;o deep all the Way, the Banks &s;o &s;oft, and the Reaches of the River &s;o &s;hort, that, in a Word, 'tis the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t Harbour in the World; and we &s;aw two Ships of eighty Guns, each riding afloat at Low-water, within Mu&s;quet-&s;hot of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> Bridge. The Ships ride as in a Mill-pond, or a Wet-dock, except that being moored at the Chains, they &s;wing up and down with the Tide; but as there is Room enough, they are moored in &s;uch manner, that they cannot &s;wing foul of one another; nor did I ever hear of any Accident that befel any of the King's Ships here by Storms and Weather, ex|cept in that dreadful Tempe&s;t in 1703, when the <HI>Royal Catharine</HI> was driven on Shore, and, receiving &s;ome Damage, &s;unk; and the Ship al&s;o being old, could not be weigh'd again.</P>
<P>There are Two Ca&s;tles on the Shore of this River, the one at <HI>Upnor,</HI> where is a good Platform of Guns, and which guards Two Reaches of the Ri|ver, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to defend all the Ships which ride above, between that and the Bridge; al&s;o on the other Shore is <HI>Gillingham</HI> Ca&s;tle, form'd for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, and well furni&s;h'd with Guns which com|mand the River; be&s;ides which there is a Fort or Platform of Guns at a Place call'd <HI>The Swamp,</HI> and
<PB N="143" REF="150">
another at <HI>Cockham</HI> Wood. But the&s;e are principally added &s;ince the Time that the <HI>Dutch</HI> made that me|morable Attempt upon the Royal Navy in this River on the 22d of <HI>June,</HI> in the Year 1667; for at that Time all was left unguarded, and there were but Four Guns that could be u&s;ed at <HI>Upnor,</HI> and &s;carce &s;o many at <HI>Gillingham,</HI> the Carriages being rotten and broken; and, in a Word, every thing concurring to invite the Enemy. There were about Twelve Guns at the I&s;le of <HI>Shepey,</HI> where now <HI>Sheerne&s;s</HI> Fort is built; but the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;oon di&s;mounted mo&s;t of them; after which they went boldly up to <HI>Black-&s;takes</HI> with their whole Squadron; and after that Seven of their bigge&s;t Men of War went up as high as <HI>Upnor,</HI> where they did what Mi&s;chief they could, and went away again, carrying off the <HI>Royal Charles,</HI> a Fir&s;t-rate Ship of 100 Guns, and burning the <HI>London,</HI> and &s;everal others, be&s;ides damaging mo&s;t of the Ships that were within their Reach; and, all things con&s;ider'd, it was a Wonder, that they went away without ruining all the re&s;t of the Navy that was in that River.</P>
<P>This Alarm gave <HI>England</HI> &s;uch a Sen&s;e of the Con|&s;equence of the River <HI>Medway,</HI> and of the Docks, and Yards at <HI>Chatham,</HI> and of the Danger the Royal Navy lay expo&s;ed to there, that all the&s;e Doors, which were open then, are lock'd up and &s;ufficiently barr'd &s;ince; and 'tis not now in the Power of any Nation, unle&s;s they were Ma&s;ters at Land as well as Sea, to give us &s;uch another Affront; for be&s;ides all the&s;e Ca|&s;tles, Lines of Guns, and Platforms on each Side the River <HI>Medway,</HI> as we go up, there is now a Royal Fort built at the Point of the I&s;le of <HI>Shepey,</HI> call'd <HI>Sheerne&s;s,</HI> which guards that Entrance into the River. This is a regular Fortification, and has &s;uch a Line of heavy Cannon commanding the Mouth of the River, that no Fleet of Men of War could at|tempt to pa&s;s by, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> did, without hazarding being torn to pieces.

<P>On the main Side of the Ferry is a &s;mall Stone-building, which will hold Nine or Ten Per&s;ons: this is &s;aid to have been erected by one <HI>George Fox,</HI> who &s;taying once there a long while in the Cold, wait|ing for the Ferry-boat, and being much affected with it, he built this Place to &s;helter others from the like Inconvenience.

<P>At pre&s;ent there are not any Remains of this Ca&s;tle to be &s;een; the Ground where it &s;tood is moated round; and there is a Well about 40 Fathom deep, &s;till remaining.

<P>Here we took Boat, and went up the <HI>Ea&s;t Swale,</HI> to <HI>Milton,</HI> or <HI>Middleton,</HI> as formerly called, which lies, as it were, hid among the Creeks; for 'tis al|mo&s;t out of Sight as well by Water as by Land, and yet it is a large Town, has a con&s;iderable <HI>Saturday</HI> Market, for Corn, Fruit, and other Provi&s;ions; and the Oy&s;ters taken in the Grounds about this Town, are the mo&s;t famous of any in <HI>Kent.</HI> This Town is governed by an Officer, who is called by the old <HI>Saxon</HI> Name <HI>Port-reve</HI>; he is cho&s;en an|nually on St. <HI>James</HI>'s-<HI>day,</HI> and he &s;upervi&s;es the Weights and Mea&s;ures all over the Hundred of <HI>Milton.</HI> It had antiently a Royal Palace for the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Kings.</P>
<P>From hence, keeping the Coa&s;t, and the great Road together, for they are &s;till within View of one another, we come to <HI>Sittingburn,</HI> formerly a Market-town, but &s;till a con&s;iderable Thorough-fare, and full of good Inns.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t by the Town are the Ruins of a Fortification rai&s;ed by King <HI>Alfred,</HI> when in Pur&s;uit of the <HI>Danes,</HI> called <HI>Bavord-ca&s;tle.</HI> They boa&s;t here much, of one <HI>Norwood</HI> having entertained King <HI>Henry</HI> V. on his triumphant Return from <HI>France</HI>; and tho' the Entertainment was, according to the Times, very elegant, yet the whole Expence of it amounted to no more than 9<HI>s.</HI> and 9<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Sittingburn</HI> we came to <HI>Fever&s;ham</HI>; which is a large fair Town, having one long and broad Street: it has a very good Market-hou&s;e, where the Market is kept on <HI>Wedne&s;days</HI> and <HI>Saturdays</HI>; and
<PB N="149" REF="156">
there are Two annual Fairs in this Town, of Ten Days each; <HI>viz.</HI> on <HI>February</HI> the 14th, and on <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 1&s;t. This Town is well peopled, and in a very flouri&s;hing State, being in the Neighbour|hood of one of the be&s;t Parts of <HI>Kent,</HI> and having a very commodious Creek to bring in, or carry out their Goods; but many of the Inhabitants have carried on the Smuggling Trade for Years, for which this Creek lies very convenient. <HI>Brandy,</HI> and often <HI>French Wines,</HI> are &s;old here at very low Rates, e&s;pecially at &s;uch times as the Smugglers have been apprehen&s;ive of Di&s;covery; to prevent which they have been known to &s;ell their Wines to any Per&s;ons who would venture to purcha&s;e them, for 2<HI>d. per</HI> Quart.</P>
<P>The Fi&s;hermen here have a very good Cu&s;tom: They will admit no one to take out his Free|dom, unle&s;s he be a married Man. The Trade for Oy&s;ters here with the <HI>Dutch</HI> is &s;o large, as to bring in between 2 and 3000<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> ready Money, from <HI>Holland,</HI> for this Commodity only.</P>
<P>At <HI>Fever&s;ham</HI> are the Remains of a Mona&s;tery founded by King <HI>Stephen,</HI> where he was buried with his Family. At pre&s;ent nothing is left but two Gate-hou&s;es, of mean Structure. At the Di&s;&s;olution, they &s;ay, the Coffin of Lead, which held the Royal Body, was taken up and &s;old; but the Corps was thrown into the <HI>Thames,</HI> and taken up by &s;ome Fi&s;hermen. Here, in the Year 903, King <HI>Ethel&s;tan</HI> enacted Laws.</P>
<P>It was at the Mouth of this <HI>Swale,</HI> namely, at <HI>Shellne&s;s,</HI> &s;o called from the Abundance of Oy&s;ter-&s;hells always lying there, that the Smack in which the late King <HI>James</HI> II. embarked for his E&s;cape into <HI>France,</HI> ran on Shore, and being boarded by the Fi&s;hermen, the King was taken Pri&s;oner; and I mu&s;t mention it to the Reproach of the People of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> whatever the Conduct of that unfortunate
<PB N="150" REF="157">
Prince had been, that the Fi&s;hermen and Rabble treated him, even after they were told who he was, with the utmo&s;t Indecency, u&s;ing his Maje&s;ty with &s;uch per&s;onal Indignity, and giving him &s;uch oppro|brious and abu&s;ive Language, and &s;earching him in &s;o rude a manner, that the King him&s;elf &s;aid, <HI>he was never more apprehen&s;ive of lo&s;ing his Life than at that Time.</HI> He was afterwards carried by them up to the Town, where he was not much better treated for &s;ome time, till &s;ome neighbouring Gentlemen of the County came in, who under&s;tood their Duty better, by whom he was pre&s;erved from farther Vio|lence, till Coaches and a Guard came from <HI>London,</HI> by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Order, to conduct him with Safety and Freedom to <HI>London</HI>; where he was much better received.</P>
<P>While I was near this Town &s;ome Years before, a terrible Accident happened; namely, the blowing up of a Powder-mill, which &s;tood upon the River, clo&s;e to the Town; the Bla&s;t &s;hatter'd the whole Town, broke the Windows, blew down Chimneys, and Gable-ends; and &s;everal People were killed at the Powder-hou&s;e it&s;elf, tho' not any, as I remember, in the Town. But what was mo&s;t remarkable in it all, was, that the elde&s;t Son of the Ma&s;ter of the Powder-mill, a Youth of about Fifteen Years of Age, who was not in the Mill, or near it, when it blew up, but in a Boat upon the River, rowing cro&s;s for his Diver&s;ion, was killed by a Piece of the Ma|terials of the Mill, which were blown up into the Air, and fell down upon him in the Boat.</P>
<P>After I have mentioned the Tombs of King <HI>Stephen</HI> and his Queen, in <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> I know nothing el&s;e this Town is remarkable for, except the mo&s;t no|torious Smuggling Trade, which I have mentioned, and which is carried on partly by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> in their Oy&s;ter-boats; nay, even the Owling Trade, or clande&s;tine Exporting of Wool,

<P><HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> is a very antient Town: the River <HI>Medway,</HI> over which it has a Bridge, is navigable up to it by large Hoys, of 50 or 60 Tons Burden, the Tide flowing quite up to the Town. In 1739, an Act pa&s;&s;ed for making it further navigable, of which I &s;hall take proper Notice, when I come to &s;peak of the Timber in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex.</HI></P>
<P>Here is carried on a Manufacture of Linen-thread, and likewi&s;e, in the Neighbourhood, are great Plan|tations of Hops, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be fir&s;t planted here at the Beginning of the Reformation, which gave Occa&s;ion to that old Di&s;tich,

<P>All that Side of the County which I have men|tioned, as it is mar&s;hy and unhealthy, by its Situa|tion among the Waters, is chiefly inhabited by Ship-builders, Fi&s;hermen, Seafaring-men, and Hu&s;band|men, and &s;uch as depend upon them; and very few Families of Note are found among them.

<P>There is not much Manufacturing in this County: what is left is chiefly at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and in this Town of <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> and its Neighbourhood.

<P>This Town of <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> is a Peculiar of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who is the proper In|cumbent, and puts in a Curate to officiate for him. The Archbi&s;hop has a Palace here, which is e&s;teemed very antient, to which there is a Chapel belonging. The Architecture is <HI>Gothick,</HI> but good of the Kind; and &s;ome Parts of it have been repaired after the mo|dern Manner. <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> is a <HI>Roman</HI> Station, named <HI>Vagniacis</HI> or <HI>Madviacis,</HI> from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Maedwaeg</HI> the Meadows on the River <HI>Vaga,</HI> which

In the Hands of Dr. <HI>Dodd</HI> at <HI>Addington,</HI> near <HI>Malling,</HI> in the Year 1720, a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Coin of Amber was found, in the Foundation of a Stone Wall. The convex Side was plain; on the Concave was a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, rude enough. The A&s;&s;izes are generally held here, and always the County Elections; and it is governed by a Mayor, and Twelve Jurats.</P>
<P><HI>Charing,</HI> not far off, was the antient <HI>Durolenum,</HI> &s;ituated upon a Spring of the River <HI>Len.</HI> Here the Archbi&s;hops of <HI>Canterbury</HI> had a ca&s;tellated Palace, given them by &s;ome of the fir&s;t <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, of which there are large Ruins.</P>
<P>In my Way to <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> on a former Journey, I &s;aw <HI>Mareworth</HI> Ca&s;tle, a pretty Fabrick, belong|ing to the Earl of <HI>We&s;tmorland</HI> and on a ri&s;ing Ground, within a Mile of <HI>Aylesford,</HI> viewed an Antiquity, vulgarly called <HI>Ketts-cotty-hou&s;e,</HI> which are three great Stones piled on each other, and deemed the Tombs of <HI>Kentigern</HI> and <HI>Horbus,</HI> two <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Princes, &s;lain in Battle, and there bury'd.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecuting my Journey from <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> I cannot help mentioning <HI>Lenham,</HI> a Town about 17 Miles di&s;tant from that City; in re|lation to which the Rt. Rev. Continuator of <HI>Camden</HI> records the following extraordinary Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"At <HI>Lenham,</HI> &s;ays he, is a thing exceeding remarkable, mentioned on the Tomb of <HI>Robert Thomp&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in the Church there, who was Grandchild to that truly religious Matron, <HI>Mary Honeywood,</HI> Wife of <HI>Robert Honeywood,</HI> of <HI>Charing,</HI>

<P>From hence I pur&s;ued my Journey to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> which all Writers agree was called, by the <HI>Britons, Kent,</HI> and is the <HI>Duroverno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> of the <HI>Romans</HI>; of which Town, and its Antiquities, &s;o much has been &s;aid, and &s;o accurately, that I need do no more than mention it briefly.

<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. That Seven Bi&s;hops of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> including that <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI>; lie buried here in one Vault.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>Thomas &agrave; Becket,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of this See, in&s;ulted the King his Sovereign in an un&s;ufferable Manner; in&s;omuch that in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. he was here murdered by the Connivance, as &s;ome &s;ay, of the King; and they &s;hew what they call his Blood upon the Pavement at this Day.</P>
<P N="4">4. That they &s;hew the Stone-&s;teps a&s;cending to his Shrine, (he being afterwards canonized) worn away to a Slope, by the Knees of the Pilgrims, who vi&s;ited it.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the Bodies of King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and of <HI>Edward the Black Prince,</HI> are buried here, and the magnificent Effigies of the latter, very curiou&s;ly carved, lies on his Tomb or Monument. Here is a pretty Chapel, originally de&s;ign'd for the Celebration of Ma&s;&s;es for the Soul of King <HI>Henry</HI> IV.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="156" REF="163">6. That the immen&s;e Wealth offered by Votaries and Pilgrims, for &s;everal Ages, to the Shrine of <HI>Becket,</HI> was &s;uch, that the famous <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> who &s;aw it, &s;ays of it thus:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All &s;hone, &s;parkled, glittered with rare and very large Jewels; and even in the whole Church appeared a Profu&s;ene&s;s above that of Kings."</Q>
In &s;hort, Gold was one of the meane&s;t Trea&s;ures of his Shrine: and at the Di&s;&s;olution, as <HI>Dugdale</HI> ob&s;erves, the Plate and Jewels filled Two great Che&s;ts, each whereof re|quired Eight Men to carry out of the Church. And <HI>Camden</HI> &s;ays, the Name of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to whom it was dedicated, was almo&s;t laid a&s;ide for that of St. <HI>Thomas.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7.

There is an old Picture of <HI>Becket</HI>'s Martyrdom, and an antient Painting upon the Wall, of the Siege of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in the Habits of our Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P N="8">8. Here are al&s;o to be &s;een the Monuments of Cardinal <HI>Courticello,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Pole,</HI> Archbi&s;hop <HI>Chichley</HI>; Bp. <HI>Peckham</HI>'s, carved in Wood upwards of 450 Years ago; Bi&s;hop <HI>Wharton,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> Archbi&s;hop <HI>Langton</HI>; with many others of le&s;s Account.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is a large and noble Pile of Build|ing: very curious Remnants of painted Gla&s;s are &s;till to be &s;een in the Windows. It is intirely vaulted with Stone, and of a very pretty Model; but much too high for its Breadth, as all <HI>Gothick</HI> Buildings were. The Metropolitan Chair is of grey Marble, &s;tanding behind the High Altar. The Cloi&s;ters are pretty good, and near them a very large Chapel, called the <HI>Sermon-hou&s;e,</HI> wain&s;cotted
<PB N="157" REF="164">
with <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Oak. Under it is a large Prote&s;tant <HI>French</HI> Church, given fir&s;t by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to the <HI>Walloons,</HI> who fled hither from the Per&s;ecution of the Duke <HI>d'Alva.</HI> The Number of the&s;e Re|fugees has been &s;ince very much increa&s;ed by <HI>French</HI> Prote&s;tants obliged to leave their native Country, thro' the Cruelty of <HI>Louis</HI> XIV.</P>
<P>The Clo&s;e where the Hou&s;es of the Prebendaries &s;tand, is very &s;pacious and fair, and a great many very good Hou&s;es are built in it, and &s;ome with good Gardens.</P>
<P>Here are many Remains of <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> Buildings. The City is &s;trongly walled about, and many Towers at due Intervals, a deep Ditch clo&s;e underneath, and a great Rampart of Earth within. The Materials of the Walls are chiefly Flint.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle was built in the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> I. of the &s;ame Form, and the Walls of the &s;ame Thickne&s;s, with that of <HI>Roche&s;ter. Dungeon|hill,</HI> a very high Mount, &s;eems to have been Part of the old Ca&s;tle. Oppo&s;ite to it, without the Walls, is an Hill, &s;eeming to have been rai&s;ed by the <HI>Danes,</HI> when they be&s;ieged the City. The Top of <HI>Dun|geon-hill</HI> is equal to the Top of the Ca&s;tle, and ex|hibits a fine Pro&s;pect over the City and Country.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI>'s Mona&s;tery, two Gates remain next the City, and both very &s;tately. Perhaps one be|longed to King <HI>Ethelbert</HI>'s Palace, the other to the Mona&s;tery, which doubtle&s;s was very &s;plendid; for it covers a great Compa&s;s of Ground, and is &s;ur|rounded with a very high Wall. There were con|tinual Quarrels between the Monks of <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> and of <HI>Thomas &agrave; Becket,</HI> both very rich, and very con|tentious.</P>
<P>Near this Mona&s;tery is a va&s;t angular Piece of a Tower, (be&s;ides half of another) about 30 Feet high, which has been undermined by digging away a Cour&s;e at Bottom, in order to be thrown down;
<PB N="158" REF="165">
but it happened only to disjoint it&s;elf from the Foun|dation, and lodged it&s;elf in the Ground in the pre|&s;ent inclining State. Thus being equally poi&s;ed, it pre&s;ents a View of Terror, and forbids a too near Acce&s;s.</P>
<P>The adjacent Clo&s;e is full of religious Ruins, and in a Corner of it are the Walls of a Chapel, &s;aid to have been a Chri&s;tian Temple before <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI>'s Time, and recon&s;ecrated by him to St. <HI>Pancras.</HI> Near it is a little Room, &s;aid to have been King <HI>Ethelbert</HI>'s Pagan Chapel. The Vulgar &s;ay, here are the Marks of the Devil's Claws.</P>
<P>Ea&s;tward of this, and farther out of the City, is <HI>St. Martin</HI>'s Church, &s;aid to be <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI>'s fir&s;t See, and the Place whither King <HI>Ethelbert</HI>'s Queen u&s;ed to repair to divine Service. It is built mo&s;tly of <HI>Roman</HI> Brick. In the Middle is a very large old fa&s;hioned Font, &s;uppo&s;ed to be that where the King was baptized.</P>
<P>North of the City is a very &s;mall Remainder of <HI>St. Gregory</HI>'s Chapel, founded probably by <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> to the Honour of that Pope, his Patron.</P>
<P>The City has been much advantaged by the Set|tlement in it of Two or Three thou&s;and <HI>French</HI> Prote&s;tants, Men, Women, and Children, owing to the above-mentioned Expul&s;ion of the Prote&s;tants under <HI>Louis</HI> XIV.</P>
<P>The Employment of tho&s;e Refugees was chiefly <HI>Broad Silk Weaving,</HI> which has &s;uffered &s;everal Changes and Alterations; but is &s;till carried on here to &s;ome Account.</P>
<P>But what has added mo&s;t to the Advantage of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> is the Hop-grounds all round the Place, to the Amount of &s;everal Thou&s;and Acres, in&s;o|much that <HI>Canterbury</HI> was, for &s;ome time, the greate&s;t Plantation of Hops in the whole I&s;land; but now they have a Rival, if not an Over-match, about <HI>Farnham,</HI> as I &s;hall ob&s;erve in its Place.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="166">In <HI>January</HI> 1738, were found in a Shave belong|ing to the E&s;tate of Sir <HI>John Hales,</HI> who lives in this Neighbourhood, and within his Manor of <HI>Tun|&s;tall</HI> near <HI>Sittingbourn,</HI> &s;everal Hundreds of broad Pieces of Gold, which were thought to be con|cealed in the Time of the late Civil Wars by an An|ce&s;tor of Sir <HI>John.</HI> They were found by a poor Boy, who was rambling in the Coppice; and not knowing what to make of them, was playing with &s;ome of them at a Farmer's in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the Farmer got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them; but not being able to keep the Secret, he refunded 624 of the Broad-pieces for the U&s;e of the Crown: Tho' Sir <HI>John</HI> laid Claim to the Whole.</P>
<P>The Shore from <HI>Whit&s;table,</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;t-Swale,</HI> affords nothing remarkable but Sea-marks, and &s;mall Towns on the Coa&s;t, till we came to <HI>Margate,</HI> noted for King <HI>William</HI>'s frequently Landing here in his Returns from <HI>Holland,</HI> and for &s;hipping a va&s;t Quantity of Corn for <HI>London</HI> Market, mo&s;t, if not all of it, the Product of the I&s;le of <HI>Thanet,</HI> in which it &s;tands.

<P>But it may not be unacceptable to tran&s;cribe a few Lines from <HI>Camden,</HI> in Honour to the Indu&s;try of the Inhabitants in this Part of the I&s;le of <HI>Thanet,</HI> which I recommend to the <HI>Admiration,</HI> for I doubt it would be too much to &s;ay <HI>Imitation,</HI> of the re&s;t of <HI>Britain,</HI> both North and South. It is as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nor mu&s;t I here omit the mention of a Thing very much to the Honour of the Inhabitants of <HI>Thanet,</HI> tho&s;e e&s;pecially who live near the Roads or Harbours of <HI>Margate, Ram&s;gate,</HI> and <HI>Brod|&s;tear</HI>; namely, that they are exceeding indu&s;trious,
<PB N="160" REF="167">
and are, as it were, <HI>amphibious Creatures,</HI> and get their Living both by Sea and Land: they deal in both Elements, are both Fi&s;hers and Plough|men, both Hu&s;bandmen and Mariners; and the &s;elf-&s;ame Hand that holds the Plough, &s;teers the Ship. According to the &s;everal Sea&s;ons, they make Nets, fi&s;h for Cod, Herring, Mackarel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> go to Sea them&s;elves, and export their own Com|modities. And tho&s;e very Men al&s;o dung their Ground, plough, &s;ow, harrow, reap, inn, be|ing quick and active in both Employments; and &s;o the Cour&s;e of their Labours runs round. And when there happen any Shipwrecks, as there do here now and then, (for tho&s;e Shallows and Shelves &s;o much dreaded by Seamen lie over-again&s;t it; namely, the <HI>Godwin,</HI> the <HI>Brakes,</HI> the <HI>Four-foot,</HI> the <HI>Whitdick,</HI> &amp;c.) they are extremely indu&s;trious to &s;ave the Lading."</Q>
I &s;hall only add, That it is highly to the Reputation of tho&s;e People, if they continue to de&s;erve this excellent Character; but I have heard of &s;ome late In&s;tances, that are not at all to their Honour in this latter Particular.</P>
<P>At <HI>Stanar</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Thanet,</HI> the <HI>Rutupiae</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> is to be &s;een the Sepulchre of <HI>Vortimer,</HI> King of the antient <HI>Britons,</HI> who having vanqui&s;hed the <HI>Saxons</HI> in many Battles, and at la&s;t driven them out of the I&s;land, ordered, before his Death, that he &s;hould be buried here, on a fond Conceit that his Corp&s;e would fright them from landing any more upon this Coa&s;t. Like the great <HI>Scipio,</HI> who having &s;ubdued the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> ordered his Tomb to be turned towards <HI>Africa,</HI> to fright them from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Italy.</HI> But the poor <HI>Britons</HI> &s;oon found the Difference between a <HI>King</HI> in the <HI>Field,</HI> and <HI>one</HI> in the <HI>Grave.</HI></P>
<P>On the North-ea&s;t Point of this Land, is the Promontory, or Head-land, which I have often
<PB N="161" REF="168">
mentioned, called the <HI>North-Foreland</HI>; which, by a Line drawn due North to the <HI>Na&s;e</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> about Six Miles &s;hort of <HI>Harwich,</HI> makes the Mouth of the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and the Port of <HI>London.</HI> As &s;oon as any Ve&s;&s;els pa&s;s this <HI>Foreland</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> they are properly &s;aid to be in the open Sea; if to the North, they enter the <HI>German</HI> Ocean; if to the South, the Chanel, as 'tis called, that is, the narrow Seas between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI>; and all the Towns or Harbours before we come this Length, whether on the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> or <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Shore, are called Members of the Port of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>From this Point We&s;tward, the fir&s;t Town of Note is <HI>Ram&s;gate,</HI> a &s;mall Port; the Inhabitants are mighty fond of having us call it <HI>Romans-gate</HI>; pre|tending that the <HI>Romans,</HI> under <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> made their fir&s;t Attempt to land here, and that, being driven back by a Storm, he &s;oon returned, and coming on Shore with a good Body of Troops, beat back the <HI>Britons,</HI> and fortify'd his Camp, ju&s;t at the Entrance of the Creek, where the Town now &s;tands; while others as po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert, that that great Com|mander fir&s;t landed at <HI>Deal</HI>; as I &s;hall ob&s;erve anon.</P>
<P><HI>Richborough-ca&s;tle</HI> is a Mile di&s;tant from <HI>Stanar</HI> and <HI>Sandwich.</HI> At the Foot of it runs the River coming from <HI>Canterbury.</HI> This River at fir&s;t di&s;|charged it&s;elf into the Sea by <HI>Ebbesflete,</HI> North of the <HI>Roman</HI> City <HI>Rutupiae,</HI> now <HI>Stanar</HI>; till the Sand pouring &s;o directly upon it, obliged the Stream to &s;lide under the Cliff by <HI>Richborough-ca&s;tle,</HI> and &s;o by <HI>Sandwich.</HI> The Ca&s;tle is a mo&s;t noble Rem|nant of <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquity. The Walls on Three Sides are pretty intire, and in &s;ome Places &s;till about 25 or 30 Feet high, without any Ditch. The Side next the Sea being upon a kind of Cliff, the Top of the Wall is but level with the Ground. Here, in the latter Times of the Empire, the <HI>Legio</HI> II. <HI>Aug.</HI> was quartered. And from the Condition of the
<PB N="162" REF="169">
Walls it mu&s;t have been de&s;troy'd with great Vio|lence, probably by the <HI>Saxons.</HI> In the Way to <HI>Sandwich,</HI> upon an Eminence, is the Remainder of an Amphitheatre made of Turf, probably for the Exerci&s;e and Diver&s;ion of the Gari&s;on. Before <HI>Sandwich</HI> Gates are two <HI>Roman Tumuli,</HI> on one of which &s;tands a Windmill. And South of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> on the Sea-&s;hore, are Six large and broad <HI>Celtic Tu|muli,</HI> at equal Di&s;tances. This flat Coa&s;t is fenced again&s;t the Ocean by the Sand-downs. From <HI>Sand|wich</HI> as far as <HI>Hythe,</HI> the Coa&s;t of <HI>France</HI> was vi&s;ible all the Way as we rode. The Reverend Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> has publi&s;hed, within the&s;e few Years, a curious Hi&s;tory of the I&s;le of <HI>Thanet,</HI> to which I &s;hall refer for &s;everal Particulars, which de&s;erve the Attention of a Traveller.</P>
<P><HI>Sandwich,</HI> one of the Cinque-ports, lies in the Bottom of a Bay, at the Mouth of the River <HI>Stour,</HI> formerly a Town of great Repute and Trade. It decay'd in the <HI>Saxons</HI> Time, and was utterly ruined by the <HI>Danes.</HI> Being rai&s;ed again, it had the Mi&s;|fortune to be reduced to A&s;hes in King <HI>John</HI>'s Reign; after which it was rebuilt. But in the Reign of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> the Mouth of its Harbour was &s;o choaked up by a Ship of great Burden, which &s;unk in it, and gave Opportunity to the Sands and Beach &s;o to fill it up, that it was incurable: the Town of con&s;e|quence fell to Decay, and it is now a very poor Place.</P>
<P><HI>Sandwich</HI> is noted for Carrots, which are brought to <HI>London</HI> during the Winter Sea&s;on; and from hence it is that mo&s;t of the Markets are &s;upplied with the&s;e Roots, which are e&s;teemed the &s;weete&s;t, as they are al&s;o the large&s;t which are produced in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> or perhaps in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>From this Place al&s;o the Seed&s;men in <HI>London</HI> are furni&s;hed with the greate&s;t Quantity of their Seeds: the Land being light, &s;andy, and fre&s;h, is very good
<PB N="163" REF="170">
for producing mo&s;t Sorts of Seeds, and the Ground being pretty low, the Seeds do not &s;o often receive a Blight, as in many other Places.</P>
<P>Not far from hence is <HI>Wingham,</HI> which gives Title of Baron to Earl <HI>Cowper.</HI> From hence I went to <HI>Deal,</HI> called by <HI>Cae&s;ar Dola,</HI> having landed not far from this Place. It is the famous Road for Ship|ping, &s;o well known all over the trading World by the Name of the <HI>Downs,</HI> and where almo&s;t all Ships which arrive from Foreign Parts for <HI>London,</HI> or go from <HI>London</HI> to Foreign Parts, and pa&s;s the Chanel, generally &s;top; the Homeward-bound, to di&s;patch Letters, &s;end their Merchants and Owners the good News of their Arrival, and &s;et their Pa&s;&s;engers on Shore; and the Outward-bound, to take in fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, to receive their la&s;t Orders, Letters, and Farewels from Owners, and Friends, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some|times, when the Wind pre&s;ents fair, Ships come in here, and pa&s;s thro' at once, without coming to an Anchor; for they are not obliged to &s;top, but for their own Convenience.</P>
<P>The <HI>Downs</HI> would be a very wild and dangerous Road for Ships, were it not for the <HI>South-Foreland,</HI> a Head of Land forming the Ea&s;t Point of the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Shore; and is called the <HI>South,</HI> as its Situation re|&s;pects the <HI>North-Foreland</HI>; and which breaks the Sea off, which would otherwi&s;e come rolling up from the We&s;t, to the Flats or Bank of Sands, which for Three Leagues together, and at about a League, or League and half Di&s;tance, run parallel with the Shore, and are dry at low Water; &s;o that the&s;e two, breaking all the Force of the Sea, on the Ea&s;t, South, and South-we&s;t, make the <HI>Downs</HI> accounted a very good Road.</P>
<P>And yet on &s;ome particular Winds, and e&s;pecially, if they over-blow, the <HI>Downs</HI> proves &s;uch a wild Road, that Ships are driven from their Anchors, and often run on Shore, or are forced on the &s;aid Sands,
<PB N="164" REF="171">
or into <HI>Sandwich-bay,</HI> or <HI>Ram&s;gate-pier,</HI> in great Di&s;tre&s;s; this is particularly when the Wind blows hard at South-ea&s;t, or at Ea&s;t-by-north, or Ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, and &s;ome other Points; and terrible Havock has been made in the <HI>Downs</HI> at &s;uch times.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t unhappy In&s;tance that can be given of any Di&s;a&s;ter in the <HI>Downs,</HI> was in the time of that terrible Tempe&s;t, which we call, by way of Di&s;tin|ction, <HI>The Great Storm,</HI> being on the 27th of <HI>Nov.</HI> 1703: Unhappy in particular, for that there chanced at that time to be a great Part of the Royal Navy come into the <HI>Downs,</HI> in their way to <HI>Chatham,</HI> to be laid up.</P>
<P>Five of the bigge&s;t Ships had the good Fortune to pu&s;h thro' the <HI>Downs</HI> the Day before, finding the Wind then blew very hard, and were come to an Anchor at the <HI>Gunfleet</HI>; and had they had but one fair Day more, they had been all &s;afe at the <HI>Nore,</HI> or in the River <HI>Medway</HI> at <HI>Black-&s;takes.</HI></P>
<P>There remained in the <HI>Downs</HI> about 12 Sail, when this terrible Tempe&s;t began, at which time <HI>England</HI> may be &s;aid to have received the greate&s;t Lo&s;s that ever happened to the Royal Navy at one time, either by Weather, by Enemies, or by any Accident what&s;o|ever. The &s;hort Account of it is as follows:</P>
<P>The <HI>Northumberland,</HI> a Third Rate, carrying 70 Guns, and 353 Men; the <HI>Re&s;toration,</HI> a Second Rate, carrying 76 Guns, and 386 Men; the <HI>Sterling Ca&s;tle,</HI> a Second Rate, carrying 80 Guns, and 400 Men, but had only 349 Men on board; and the <HI>Mary,</HI> a Third Rate, of 64 Guns, having 273 Men on board; the&s;e were all lo&s;t, with all their Men, except one Man out of the <HI>Mary,</HI> and 70 Men out of the <HI>Sterling-Ca&s;tle,</HI> who were taken up by Boats from <HI>Deal.</HI></P>
<P>All this is be&s;ides the Lo&s;s of Merchants Ships, which was exceeding great, not here only, but in almo&s;t all the Ports in the South and We&s;t of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and al&s;o in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="172">The Town of <HI>Deal</HI> carries on &s;ome Foreign Trade, and is very much improved of late Years, to which the great Re&s;ort of Seamen to it from the Ships in the <HI>Downs</HI> has not a little contributed.</P>
<P>I took a Niew of <HI>Sandown-ca&s;tle, Deal</HI> and <HI>Wal|mer-ca&s;tles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sandown-ca&s;tle</HI> is compo&s;ed of four Lunets of very thick arched Work of Stone, with many Port-holes for great Guns. In the Middle is a great round Tower, with a Ci&s;tern at-top; and underneath, an arched Cavern Bomb-proof. A Fo&s;s encompa&s;&s;es the Whole, to which is a Pa&s;&s;age over a Draw-bridge.</P>
<P><HI>Deal-ca&s;tle</HI> and <HI>Walmer-ca&s;tle</HI> are, like the former, all built, as I have &s;aid, by K. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to guard this Coa&s;t. Between <HI>Walmer-ca&s;tle</HI> and <HI>Deal</HI> was probably the Spot where <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> landed in his fir&s;t Ex|pedition, becau&s;e it is the fir&s;t Place where the Shore can be a&s;cended North of <HI>Dover</HI>; and exactly an&s;wers his a&s;&s;igned Di&s;tance of eight Miles. In his &s;econd Ex|pedition, with many more Ships, and upon a perfect Knowledge of the Country, he might land at <HI>Deal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dover</HI> &s;tands in a mo&s;t romantick Situation: it is a great Valley, and the only one about this Coa&s;t, where Water is admitted inwards of the Cliff, which is here very high. The Sea formerly came a good way higher up, and made a large Port. Anchors have been found above the Town. The <HI>Roman</HI> City <HI>Dubris</HI> was to the South of the River. The <HI>Watling &s;treet</HI> enters it as <HI>Bigin-gate,</HI> coming very &s;trait from <HI>Canterbury</HI> over <HI>Barham-down,</HI> where it is very perfect. Some of the Walls are left. The Churches are of a very antique Make: that of <HI>St. Martin</HI> is Collegiate, founded by <HI>Wightred</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> and is a venerable Ruin. It was built in Form of a Cro&s;s. Of the Priory, now a Farm-hou&s;e, are large Remains. The Ho&s;pital over|again&s;t it is made a Store-hou&s;e. Here the Knights Ho&s;pitalers or Templers lodged, as they came into,
<PB N="166" REF="173">
or went out of the Kingdom. The Piers which form the Haven or large Ba&s;on, are co&s;tly and great Works. Above is a Fort with four Ba&s;tions of mo|dern Date. The broad Beach, which lies at the Mouth of this great Valley, and was the Harbour in <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Time, is very delightful. One long Street here is nam'd <HI>Snaregate,</HI> from the mo&s;t tre|mendous Rocks of Chalk, which project directly over the Hou&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Dover</HI> Ca&s;tle is very large, and &s;ituated upon a Rock rugged and &s;teep on every Side; but towards the Sea it ri&s;es to an extraordinary Height. Tho' of late Years neglected, it was once &s;o well fortify'd, and of &s;uch Importance, as to be accounted the Key of <HI>England.</HI> And <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> when he had an Eye upon the Kingdom, took an Oath of <HI>Harold,</HI> that he &s;hould deliver into his Hands this Ca&s;tle with the Well, which is Sixty Fathoms deep, and &s;aid to be the Work of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI> In &s;hort it was the &s;tronge&s;t old Fortification in the World; and takes up thirty Acres of Ground.</P>
<P>In the late War with <HI>France,</HI> 1500 Pri&s;oners were confined in the great Ca&s;tle. The Bra&s;s Gun, call'd <HI>Queen</HI> Elizabeth<HI>'s Pocket-Pi&s;tol,</HI> is a great Curio&s;i|ty, twenty-two Feet long. It is excellently well wrought, requires Fifteen Pounds of Powder, and carries a Ball Seven Miles. Here are Two very old Keys, and a bra&s;s Horn, which &s;eem to be the En|&s;igns of Authority belonging to the Con&s;table of the Ca&s;tle, or Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. One Part of the Fortifications con&s;i&s;ts of a circular Work, in which &s;tands an old Church, &s;aid to have been built by <HI>Lucius,</HI> the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian King in <HI>Britain,</HI> out of &s;ome of the <HI>Roman</HI> Ruins; for there are huge Quantities of <HI>Roman</HI> Brick laid into the Work; and the Remainder is of Stone, originally cut by the <HI>Romans.</HI> It is in Form of a Cro&s;s, and has a &s;quare Tower in the Middle. The Stone Windows are of
<PB N="167" REF="174">
much later Date than the Building: but the greate&s;t Curio&s;ity is the Pharos or <HI>Roman</HI> Watch-tower, &s;tanding at the We&s;t-end of the Church. This Building was made u&s;e of as a Steeple, and had a plea&s;ant Ring of Bells, which Sir <HI>George Rooke</HI> pro|cur'd to be carried away to <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> Since when, the Lead which cover'd it, has been taken away by Order of the Officers of Ordnance; &s;o that this rare Piece of Architecture is left expo&s;ed to the Sea and Weather. Here was found a Coin of <HI>Diocle|&s;ian.</HI> The <HI>Erpinghams</HI> Arms are patch'd up again&s;t one Side of the <HI>Pharos</HI>; &s;o that it &s;eems to have been repair'd in the Days of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. when the Lord <HI>Erpingham</HI> was Warden of <HI>Dover-ca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>Upon another Rock over-again&s;t that on which the Ca&s;tle is &s;ituated, and almo&s;t as high, are the Remains of an old Watch-tower, now vulgarly called <HI>Breden&s;tone,</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>Devil's-drop,</HI> from the Strength of the Mortar. Here the new Con&s;table of the Ca&s;tle is &s;worn. Under this Place King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. built the Mole or Pile called the <HI>Pier,</HI> that Ships might ride therein with great Safety. But tho' it was done with va&s;t Labour and Expence, by large Beams fa&s;tened in the Sea, bound together with Iron, and great Piles of Wood and Stone heap'd upon all; yet the Fury of the Sea was &s;oon too hard for the Work, and the Timbers beginning to disjoint, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> expended great Sums upon it. And &s;everal Acts have pa&s;&s;ed to repair and re|&s;tore the &s;ame; which al&s;o including the Re&s;tora|tion and Pre&s;ervation of the Harbour of <HI>Rye,</HI> I &s;hall take Notice of both, when I mention that of <HI>Rye.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dover,</HI> the <HI>Portus Dubris</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> is one of the Cinque Ports, and was formerly bound to &s;end twenty-one Ships for the Wars. It affords a See to the Suffragan of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canter|bury,</HI> as often as any &s;uch is appointed. Mo&s;t of the Bu&s;ine&s;s relating to the&s;e Ports in general is done,
<PB N="168" REF="175">
and all the Courts kept here. The other Cinque Ports are <HI>Ha&s;tings, Hythe, Romney</HI> and <HI>Sandwich. Ha&s;t|ings</HI> has two Appendages, namely, <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI> and <HI>Rye,</HI> which, as well as <HI>Ha&s;tings,</HI> are in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and the others in <HI>Kent</HI>; they have all great Privileges: their Burge&s;&s;es are called Barons; who on the Co|ronations of our Sovereigns, &s;upport the Canopies over their Heads, have a Table at the King's Right Hand, the Canopy for their Fee, and enjoy other Privileges. The Lord Warden of the&s;e Five Ports is generally one of the fir&s;t Noblemen in the King|dom.</P>
<P>The Packets for <HI>France</HI> go off here, as al&s;o tho&s;e for <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> with the Mails for <HI>Flanders,</HI> and all tho&s;e Ships which carry Freights from <HI>New-York</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI> and from <HI>Virginia</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI> come gene|rally hither, and unlade their Goods, enter them with the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers, pay the Duties, and then enter them again by Certificate, reload them, and draw back the Duty by Debenture, and &s;o they go away for <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>As we pa&s;s from <HI>Dover</HI> to the &s;maller Cinque Ports of <HI>Hythe, Romney,</HI> and <HI>Rye,</HI> we &s;ee <HI>Folk&s;tone,</HI> a little Village now, which the Sea has made great Inroads upon; but which formerly made a greater Figure. A copious Spring went thro' the Town. Two Pieces of old Wall, &s;eemingly <HI>Roman,</HI> hang frightfully over the Cliff. Here are &s;ome old Guns, one of Iron of a very odd Ca&s;t, doubtle&s;s as old as the Time of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. Many <HI>Ro|man</HI> Coins have al&s;o been found. And here a Nun|nery was built by <HI>Ean&s;wide,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Eadbald,</HI> King of <HI>Kent.</HI> This Place is now principally of Note for a Multitude of Fi&s;hing-boats belonging to it, which are one Part of the Year employed in catching Mackarel for the City of <HI>London.</HI> The <HI>Folk&s;tone</HI> Men catch them, and the <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Barking</HI> Mackarel-Smacks, of which I have &s;poken
<PB N="169" REF="176">
at large in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> come down and buy them, and whi&s;k away to Market under &s;uch a Croud of Sails, that one would wonder they could bear them. About <HI>Michaelmas</HI> the&s;e <HI>Folk&s;tone</HI> Barks, among others from <HI>Shoreham, Brighthelm&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Rye,</HI> go away to <HI>Yar|mouth</HI> and <HI>Leo&s;toff,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Nor|folk,</HI> and catch Herrings for the Merchants there. It hath been ob&s;erved of &s;ome Hills in the Neigh|bourhood of <HI>Folk&s;tone,</HI> as the Right Rev. Continu|ator of <HI>Camden</HI> takes Notice, that they have vi&s;ibly &s;unk and grown lower, within the Memory of Man.</P>
<P><HI>Sandgate</HI> Ca&s;tle, &s;ituated in the Bottom of Two Hills, on the Sea-&s;hore, hath about Sixteen Guns to defend the Fi&s;hing-craft from the In&s;ults of Priva|teers, in Time of War: it hath &s;everal good Hou&s;es about it, and was built by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.</P>
<P>After we have pa&s;&s;ed this Ca&s;tle, we enter upon the Beach. Here are many Springs, which de&s;cending from the higher Ground, &s;ink immediately into this Beach, rendering it a little boggy.</P>
<P><HI>Hythe,</HI> one of the Cinque Ports, &s;tands on the Edge of the le&s;s Ridge; but the Mar&s;h has inter|cepted it from the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Hythe</HI> in <HI>Saxon</HI> &s;ignifies a <HI>Port</HI> or <HI>Station</HI>; but at pre&s;ent it hardly an&s;wers the Name; for the Sands have &s;o choaked it up, that the Sea is &s;hut out from it to a great Di&s;tance. This Town, as al&s;o <HI>We&s;t-Hythe,</HI> from which the Sea retir'd above 200 Years ago, owe their Original to <HI>Lemanis,</HI> or <HI>Limne,</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Port, of which more anon, now a little Village adjoining, which was formerly a very fa|mous Port, before it was &s;hut up with Sands, thrown in by the Sea, which gave Ri&s;e to the two <HI>Hythes</HI> before-mentioned, which, in their Turns, have met with the &s;ame Fate. A particular Providence hap|pened at <HI>Hythe, April</HI> 24. 1739. About Eleven o'Clock the Steeple of their Church, in which were
<PB N="170" REF="177">
Six Bells, fell down. About Ten Per&s;ons were pre|&s;ent when it fell, waiting in the Church-porch for the Keys to go up into the Steeple for a View; but &s;ome Delay being made in bringing them, they hap|pily receiv'd no other Damage than being terribly frightened. In a Vault under the Church we &s;aw a va&s;t Heap of human Bones, &s;ome of an extraordi|nary Size, &s;aid to be gathered up after a bloody Bat|tle fought between the <HI>Britons</HI> and <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>About a Mile di&s;tant from it is <HI>Saltwood-Ca&s;tle,</HI> a very &s;trong Seat of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> The outer Wall has Towers and Battlements, and a deep Ditch. Within, and on one Side, &s;tands the main Body of the Palace. There are two great and high Towers at the Gate of this, over which are the Arms of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Courtney,</HI> the Founder. This inner Work has a &s;tronger and higher Wall, with a broad embattled Parapet at top. Within is a Court, but the Lodgings are all demoli&s;h'd. The Floor of the ruinous Chapel is &s;trongly vaulted. In the Middle of the Court is a large &s;quare Well, &s;eemingly <HI>Roman.</HI> They &s;ay that Anchors have been dug up hereabouts, which makes it likely that the <HI>Romans</HI> had here an Iron Forge; and &s;ome will have it, that the Sea came up formerly to it, and ground this Opinion on the&s;e Anchors found here.</P>
<P>A little Way further, at the End of the <HI>Stane-&s;treet,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Road from <HI>Canterbury,</HI> is the Port of <HI>Lemanis</HI> or <HI>Limne</HI> mention'd above. At <HI>Limne</HI> Church, from the Brow of the Hill, may be di&s;|cern'd the ruinous <HI>Roman</HI> Walls, &s;ituate almo&s;t at the Bottom of the Mar&s;hes. A pretty Brook, which ri&s;es from the Rock, We&s;t of the Church, runs for &s;ome Space on the Ea&s;t Side of the Wall; then pa&s;&s;es thro' it, and &s;o along its lowermo&s;t Edge, by the Farm-hou&s;e at Bottom: here Coins have been found. Once the Sea-bank broke, and ad|mitted the Ocean into all the adjacent Mar&s;hes.
<PB N="171" REF="178">
The Port is now call'd <HI>Shipway,</HI> where the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports was formerly &s;worn, the Courts kept, and all the Pleas relating thereto, till <HI>Dover</HI> &s;uper&s;eded it. The People of <HI>Limne</HI> had a Horn and Mace, the remaining En&s;igns of their Authority.</P>
<P><HI>Romney</HI> is a large fine Village, and likewi&s;e a Cinque Port; it is the chief Town of the Mar&s;h-Grounds, which were antiently part of the Sea, called <HI>Romney Mar&s;h,</HI> and has <HI>Old Romney</HI> and <HI>Lech</HI> for its Members. It is &s;eated on a high Hill of Gravel and Sand, and on the We&s;t Side of it, had a pretty large Harbour guarded again&s;t mo&s;t of the Winds, before the Sea retir'd from it. In the Year 1287, when the Town was at its Height, it was divided into Twelve Wards, had Five Pa|ri&s;h Churches, a Priory, and an Ho&s;pital for the Sick. But it has been dwindling till it came to its pre&s;ent low Condition, ever &s;ince the Reign of <HI>Ed|ward</HI> I. when an Inundation of the Sea de&s;troy'd Men, Cattle and Hou&s;es, threw down a whole po|pulous Village called <HI>Prom-Hill,</HI> and remov'd the <HI>Rother,</HI> (in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Yz Odz) which u&s;ed to empty it&s;elf into the Sea at <HI>Romney,</HI> out of its Chanel, &s;topping up its Mouth, and opening it a nearer Pa&s;|&s;age into the Sea by <HI>Rye</HI>; leaving here only a little Bay for Fi&s;hing-boats.</P>
<P>From <HI>Romney-Mar&s;h</HI> the Shore extends it&s;elf a great way into the Sea, and makes that Point of Land called <HI>Dengyne&s;s.</HI> Ju&s;t by the River <HI>Rother,</HI> &s;tands the little Town of <HI>Appledore,</HI> which, by Di&s;|u&s;e, has lo&s;t its Market, and is of no Note now. The Sea formerly came up to it.</P>
<P><HI>Tenterden,</HI> a Mayor Market-town, lies a little to the N. W. of <HI>Appledore,</HI> near the <HI>Weald.</HI> It has a very good and high Steeple, which they &s;ay was the Cau&s;e of the <HI>Godwin-Sands,</HI> which was an E&s;tate that belonged to Earl <HI>Godwin,</HI> and was guarded
<PB N="172" REF="179">
from the Sea by a Wall; but they were &s;o intent on building the Steeple, that the Wall was neglected, and the Land overflowed, which they could never afterwards recover.</P>
<P><HI>A&s;hford,</HI> al&s;o a Mayor-town, &s;tands on the great Road, upon the River <HI>Stour.</HI> It is a pretty well built Market-town. The Church is large, and was formerly Collegiate: they hold Pleas for any thing not exceeding twenty Marks.</P>
<P><HI>Newenden</HI> de&s;erves to be mentioned for what it once was, having been formerly a fine City, which <HI>Camden</HI> calls <HI>Anderida.</HI> It was de&s;troy'd by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> but rebuilt in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I. and called <HI>Newenden,</HI> as much as to &s;ay, according to <HI>Camden</HI>'s Etymology, a new City in a little Val|ley. It had then an Harbour much frequented; but it is now a mo&s;t mi&s;erable Village, with a few poor Hou&s;es in it; the be&s;t an Ale-hou&s;e, and the Church is ill-built, and out of Repair. It has a very indifferent Bridge over the <HI>Rother,</HI> a rapid Ri|ver, which divides at this Place <HI>Kent</HI> from <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and about Nine Miles off empties it&s;elf into the Harbour of <HI>Rye. Roman</HI> Coins have been dug up here.</P>
<P>North-we&s;t of <HI>Newenden</HI> is <HI>Cranbrook,</HI> a large Market-town, noted for having been one of the fir&s;t Places where the Cloth-manufacture was &s;et up in <HI>England,</HI> which is now very much in its Wane here. But here I will conclude my Third Letter; and am, Sir,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. CONTAINING A <HI>DESCRIPTION</HI> of the County of <HI>SUSSEX,</HI> other Parts of <HI>KENT,</HI> and Part of <HI>HANTS, SURREY,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I NOW enter the County of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and &s;hall begin my Letter with the Account of <HI>Rye.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;ituated in the mo&s;t Ea&s;tern Part of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> upon an Hill, which is encompa&s;&s;ed with Rocks, that are inacce&s;&s;ible on the Sea-&s;ide. There is nothing now but &s;ome Remains of its old Walls to be &s;een, and the Ditches are almo&s;t filled up. Its Trade is in Hops, Wool, Timber, Kettles, Cannon, Chim|ney-backs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are ca&s;t at the Iron-works at <HI>Bakely,</HI> about Four Miles from <HI>Rye,</HI> on the North-we&s;t, and <HI>Breed,</HI> about Five Miles di&s;tant South-we&s;t. It is a very great Misfortune, that its Harbour has been &s;o much damaged by the Sea, and neglected; for it is almo&s;t filled up in &s;everal Places, where it was formerly the deepe&s;t, and mo&s;t con|venient. Some con&s;iderable Families, who have Lands near, have taken Advantage of this, to ex|tend
<PB N="174" REF="181">
them further upon tho&s;e Sands, which the Sea in Storms has thrown up again&s;t them; and by digging Ditches, and making Drains, there are now Fields and Meadows, where antiently was nothing but Water. By this means Ships only of a middle Size can come within any convenient Di&s;tance of the Town, whereas formerly the large&s;t Ve&s;&s;els, and even whole Fleets together, could anchor ju&s;t by the Rocks, on which the Town &s;tands; and as this Port lies over-again&s;t <HI>Dieppe</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and that there is no other Port between <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> and <HI>Do|ver,</HI> which can receive Ships of Burden, not only the Danger of the Sea, but in Time of War, of the Enemy, were e&s;caped by the Conveniency of this Harbour. But it being by the Means I have mentioned, and by the Inning of the Chanel and wa&s;te Lands, (which prevented the Flux and Re|flux of the Tide) in Danger of being utterly lo&s;t, an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed in 1721, which enacts, That no new Walls, Banks, Dams, or Stops, &s;hall thereafter be erected on either Side of the Water, that might &s;top or alter the Flux or Reflux of the Sea, between the Mouth of the Harbour, bounded by the <HI>Camber</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tle-Points,</HI> and <HI>New Shutt</HI> near <HI>Craven</HI> Sluice.</P>
<P>In 1723 another Act pa&s;&s;ed for completing the Repairs of the Harbour of <HI>Dover,</HI> and for re&s;tore|ing the Harbour of <HI>Rye</HI> to its antient Goodne&s;s, which &s;till continued to be choak'd up, and almo&s;t ruin'd, by the Shifting of the Beach without, and Settling of the Sullage within, and &s;topping the Flux of the Tide, which this Act propo&s;ed &s;hould have its free Cour&s;e thro' the <HI>Scotch-flat</HI> and <HI>Craven</HI> Sluices, or into &s;uch other Cut or Chanel as &s;hould be found mo&s;t proper and expedient.</P>
<P>And in 1724 another Act pa&s;&s;ed for making the la&s;t Act more effectual, &s;o far as it related to the Harbour of <HI>Rye,</HI> in which a Power was given to
<PB N="175" REF="182">
change the De&s;ign of making a Pa&s;&s;age by the above-named Sluices, and to open a new Cut from the <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI> Chanel, right out to the Sea. And they actually began, in pur&s;uance of this Act, to cut a broad and deep Canal, which was to be car|ried to the Sea on the Side of <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> for the U&s;e of the two Boroughs. But &s;till the&s;e Provi&s;ions being found in&s;ufficient, another Act pa&s;s'd in 1737-8, for continuing the Term and Powers granted by the former Acts, for repairing the Harbour of <HI>Dover,</HI> and for re&s;toring that of <HI>Rye</HI> to its antient Goodne&s;s, to which I mu&s;t refer the Reader.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;es of <HI>Rye</HI> are well-enough built, and of Brick, tho' generally old-fa&s;hion'd; but there are &s;ome very neat ones of a modern Ta&s;te. There is a &s;mall Settlement of <HI>French</HI> Refugees in this Town, mo&s;tly Fi&s;hermen; they have a Mini&s;ter of their own, who is paid by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> The Church is hand&s;ome and large; but there are &s;o many Di&s;&s;enters in the Town, and &s;o few of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, that they have wall'd off, and converted the We&s;tern Part of it into a Magazine for Planks. But there are two well-built Meeting-hou&s;es, one for the Pre&s;byterians, and the other for the Quakers. Another Church, which belong'd to a Mona&s;tery now demoli&s;h'd, is al&s;o turn'd into a kind of Store-hou&s;e for Planks, Hops, and other Mer|chandize. At the North-ea&s;t of <HI>Rye</HI> are the Re|mains of an old Fort, which commands the Town and Harbour, and &s;erves for the Town-gaol.</P>
<P>His late Maje&s;ty King <HI>George</HI> I. on his Return from <HI>Hanover, January</HI> 3. 1725-6, was obliged to put in here, after a very dangerous and tempe&s;tuous Pa&s;&s;age, the Fleet being unable to make <HI>Dover</HI>; and it was then experienced, what a Benefit it would have been to have had this only con&s;iderable Haven, as it formerly was, between <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> and <HI>Dover,</HI> re&s;tor'd to its pri&s;tine flouri&s;hing State; for his Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="176" REF="183">
was under great Difficulties to land there, and the larger Ships were unable to follow him.</P>
<P>This Town was, as I have &s;aid, one of the Ap|pendages, as <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI> was the other, to <HI>Ha&s;tings,</HI> as a Cinque-port, and enjoy'd the &s;ame Privileges.</P>
<P><HI>Old Winchel&s;ea</HI> &s;tood upon the Sea-&s;hore, about Two or Three Miles from the Place where the <HI>New</HI> &s;tands. It had formerly a large and &s;pacious Har|bour, was a Place of great Trade, and had no le&s;s than Eighteen Churches in it. But it was intirely de&s;troyed by the Sea, and that &s;mall Part which is not bury'd in the Sands, is now Mar&s;h and Mea|dow-land. To the S. E. of <HI>Rye,</HI> and the N. W. of <HI>New Winchel&s;ea,</HI> is &s;till to be &s;een, in the Mid&s;t of a large Plain, an old Tower, which probably &s;tood by the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>New Winchel&s;ea</HI> is &s;aid to have been built by King <HI>Edward</HI> I. partly on a Hill about Two Miles from the <HI>Old,</HI> and the like Di&s;tance from <HI>Rye,</HI> and partly in a little Valley, where it had an Harbour; but <HI>Anno</HI> 1250, the latter Part of this met with the &s;ame Fate as the former. It never was comparable to the old Town, having but three Pari&s;h Churches when it flouri&s;h'd, and now there only remains the Chan|cel of one, which is more than large enough for the Inhabitants. But yet the Town was every|where accommodated with fine &s;tone arch'd Vaults for &s;towing of Merchandize, and was laid out with admirable Regularity, the Streets being divided into 32 Quarters. Some of the Stone-work of the Three Gates are &s;till to be &s;een. The Sea is now above a Mile di&s;tant from it, the Harbour being choaked up with Sands; and Gra&s;s grows not only where the Harbour was, but even in the Streets; and in|deed there are only a few Hou&s;es remaining in the upper Part of the Town. Among the Ruins of the Walls to the S. E. are the Remains of a Ca&s;tle, as &s;ome &s;ay; or of a Mona&s;tery, as others will have it.</P>

<P>From the Beginning of <HI>Romney-mar&s;h,</HI> that is to &s;ay, at <HI>Sandgate,</HI> or <HI>Sandfoot</HI> Ca&s;tle, near <HI>Hythe,</HI> to this Place, the Country is a rich fertile Soil, full of feeding Grounds; and an incredible Number of large Sheep are fed every Year upon them, and &s;ent up to <HI>London</HI> Market. The&s;e <HI>Romney-mar&s;h</HI> Sheep are counted rather larger than the <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> Sheep, of which &s;o much is &s;aid el&s;e|where.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the va&s;t Flocks of Sheep, as above, abun|dance of large Bullocks are fed in this Part of the Country; and e&s;pecially tho&s;e they call Stall'd or Hou&s;e-fed Oxen, from their being kept within the Farmers Sheds or Yards all the latter Sea&s;on, where they are fed for the Winter-market, and generally deemed the large&s;t Beef in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="186">In <HI>Romney-mar&s;h,</HI> as in other Parts of <HI>England,</HI> are found great Timber-trees, lying at Length under Ground, as black as Ebony, and fit for U&s;e, when dried in the Sun.</P>
<P>From hence it was that, turning North, and tra|ver&s;ing the deep, dirty, but rich Part of the&s;e Two Counties, my Curio&s;ity led me to &s;ee the great Founderies, or Iron-works, which are in this Coun|ty, and where they are carried on at &s;uch a pro|digious Expence of Wood, that even in a Country almo&s;t all over-run with Timber, they begin to complain of the great Con&s;umption of it by tho&s;e Furnaces, and the Apprehen&s;ion of leaving the next Age to want Timber for building their Navies. I mu&s;t own however, that I conceived that Com|plaint was intirely groundle&s;s, the Three Counties of <HI>Kent, Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> (all which lie con|tiguous one to another) being an inexhau&s;tible Store-hou&s;e of Timber for this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>After I had been fatigued in pa&s;&s;ing this deep and heavy Part of the Country, I thought it would not be foreign to my De&s;ign, if I refre&s;hed my&s;elf with a View of <HI>Tunbridge-wells,</HI> which were not then above 12 Miles out of my Way.</P>
<P>When I came to the <HI>Wells,</HI> which were Five Miles nearer to me than the Town, &s;uppo&s;ing me then at <HI>Battle,</HI> to the Southward of them, I found a great deal of good Company there; and particularly made an Ob&s;ervation, that tho&s;e People who have nothing to do any-where el&s;e, &s;eem to be the bu&s;ie&s;t People at <HI>Tunbridge.</HI></P>
<P>After the Appearance is over at the Wells, (where the Ladies are all in <HI>De&s;habile</HI>) and at the Chapel, the Company go home; and, as if it was another Species of People, or a Collection from another Place, you are &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the Walks covered with Ladies completely dre&s;&s;ed, and gay to Profu|&s;ion;

<P>As for Gaming, Sharping, Intriguing, as al&s;o Fops, Beaux, and the like, <HI>Tunbridge</HI> u&s;ed to be as full of the&s;e as mo&s;t other publick Places; but the Act lately pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t Gaming has, in a great mea&s;ure, cured this Evil. Of this Act I &s;hall &s;ay more, when I come to <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P>The Air here is excellent, and the Provi&s;ions of all Sorts very rea&s;onable: particularly they are &s;up|plied with excellent Fi&s;h, of almo&s;t all Sorts, from <HI>Rye,</HI> and other Towns on the Sea-coa&s;t; and I &s;aw a Turbut of near twenty Pounds Weight &s;old there for Three Shillings. In the Sea&s;on of Mackarel, they have them here from <HI>Ha&s;tings,</HI> within three Hours of their being taken out of the Sea; and the Differ|ence which that makes in their Goodne&s;s, I need not mention.</P>
<P>They have likewi&s;e here abundance of Wild-fowl, of the be&s;t Sorts; &s;uch as Phea&s;ants, Partridges, Woodcocks, Snipes, Quails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> particularly they have from the <HI>South-downs</HI> the Bird called a <HI>Wheat|ear,</HI> or which I think I may call the <HI>Engli&s;h Orto|lan,</HI>&mdash;the mo&s;t delicious Ta&s;te for one Mouthful, (for 'tis hardly more) that can be imagined; but the&s;e are very dear at <HI>Tunbridge:</HI> they are much cheaper at <HI>Seaford, Lewes,</HI> and that Side of the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Tunbridge</HI> is &s;ituated upon the little River <HI>Tunn,</HI> which runs into the <HI>Medway</HI> hard by. On the Southern Bank of the River are to be &s;een the Ruins of an old Ca&s;tle, built by a natural Son of <HI>Richard</HI> I. Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> who, as Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> tells us, exchanged his Lord&s;hip of <HI>Bryany</HI> in that Duchy for <HI>Tunbridge.</HI> The Church is a modern Building; the Hou&s;es in the Town are mo&s;tly ill-built, and the Streets &s;orrily paved.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="188">The Wells are about Four Miles from the Town, and the Rocks about Ten Miles from them, and worth a Traveller's Curio&s;ity to &s;ee, as they are &s;everal prodigious Heaps of firm Stone Rocks, tho' &s;ome Miles di&s;tant from the Sea.</P>
<P>The Buildings at the Wells have much the Ad|vantage of tho&s;e in <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and may be &s;aid to con&s;titute a large and populous Town them&s;elves. There is a Church, or rather Chapel of Ea&s;e, which is very neat. This new Town, as I may call it, &s;tands in a Bottom between Two Hills, one of which is called <HI>Mount Sion,</HI> and the other <HI>Mount Ephraim,</HI> which are generally covered with good Hou&s;es, fine Gardens, and Fruit-trees. The Wells might be more properly called <HI>Spelhur&s;t Wells</HI>; for the Water ri&s;es in a Pari&s;h of that Name. The Well which contains them is well-paved, like a Ci&s;tern, and &s;urrounded with a low Wall, with a Pair of Stairs to go down. The Company walk upon the Two above-named Hills, after they have drank the Waters, and divert them&s;elves with Bowls, Dancing, or other Exerci&s;es, as the Weather will permit, and the Phy&s;icians pre&s;cribe. Near the Well is a long Gallery, paved and covered over, wherein to walk in bad Weather, and while they are taking the Waters, and where likewi&s;e the Band of Mu&s;ick have place. There are al&s;o Rooms to drink Choco|late or Coffee, and to play at Cards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> likewi&s;e a Hall to dance in.

<P>A very eminent Phy&s;ician is of Opinion, that the Waters of <HI>Bath, Tunbridge, Chiltenham,</HI> (or <HI>Scarborough,</HI> which partake of the &s;ame Qualities) and <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> make the general Kinds of mo&s;t of the various Mineral Waters on the Globe; and that he therefore who under&s;tands the&s;e, cannot be much at a Lo&s;s to determine the Virtues and Effi|cacy
<PB N="182" REF="189">
of any new Kind. And as this learned Gentle|man has favoured me with his Opinion of the&s;e &s;everal Waters, I &s;hall communicate the &s;ame in their re&s;pective Places.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, this is what he &s;ays of the Nature, Efficacy and Qualities of the&s;e of <HI>Tunbridge.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Tunbridge</HI> Waters, &s;ays he, are nothing but an Impregnation of Rain, or compre&s;&s;ed Cloud|waters in &s;ome of the Eminencies of the neigh|bouring Country. And indeed all Hills, and con&s;picuous Elevations, are mere hollow Ne&s;ts of &s;ome Minerals. Iron and Sulphur are the mo&s;t common and univer&s;al Minerals; and almo&s;t all Kinds of Stone fit for making Fences or Edifices, have in their Compo&s;ition one or both of them. All the Varieties of hard, black, dark or greyi&s;h Stones, abound with ferrugineous Particles; and Iron is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, e&s;pecially in Countries be|tween the Tropicks and the Poles, for Hu&s;bandry, that there is &s;carce a Mile &s;quare within this Com|pa&s;s, where it may not be found with its im|pregnated Waters. This is demon&s;trable by the Action of the Load&s;tone on mo&s;t Minerals, the Magnet it&s;elf &s;eeming to be &s;carce any thing but a purer Clod of Iron: and pure poli&s;hed Iron, we know, with very &s;imple Management, be|comes highly magnetick. Hence we account for the Frequency of chalybeat Mineral Waters, of &s;ome Degree of Strength or other, &s;o readily to be found between the Poles and Tropicks. And this is a bountiful Provi&s;ion of Nature to tho&s;e colder Climates, where animal Food, and fermented Liquors, are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the Support, Com|fort, and greater Proportion of animal Force required in them, for their Defence from the Swarming of ravenous Animals, and for hunting animal Food, where the Vegetable is neither &s;o proper, nutritive, nor abounding, as in the&s;e
<PB N="183" REF="190">
kindlier Climates between the Tropicks to|wards each Side of the Equator. Mineral Chalybeat Waters brace the Solids, which animal Food, and fermented Liquors, in any Plenty, are apt to relax; and wind up the Springs of animal Motion, to keep the Blood fluid, which the ju&s;t mentioned Indulgencies are di&s;po&s;ed to thicken. Soft Stone, Marl, alkalious Clay, and all Kinds of bituminous Earths, have a larger Quantity of Sulphur in them; for Sulphur, Oil, and Bitumen, always leave Earth brittle, &s;pongy, and alkalious (Alkalies being only an harder earthy Sponge); and when the watry Impregna|tions meet, they naturally produce by Fermentation &s;ome Degree of Heat in the Mixture. There is in Nature, as this learned Gentleman thinks, but one kind of Salt, which is Nitre; and that the Variety ari&s;es from a Mixture of Sulphur, Earth, or Iron, in different Proportions combined in their Compo&s;ition. Nitre however, and Sea|&s;alt, have their principal Efficacy from the pre|dominant Principle in their Texture: and thus <HI>Tunbridge</HI> Waters are only a finer Solution of blue Vitriol, or natural Salt of Steel, or Rain-waters, inimitable by Art in &s;uch &s;alutary Effects as Nature always produces. For Example: Tho' Art may imitate, in precious Stones, all the Va|rieties of Colours, Reflexions, Refractions, and Emi&s;&s;ions of Light; yet there is always &s;ome one peculiar Property, as of Hardne&s;s, Weight, or Water, which di&s;covers the Sophi&s;tication. In like manner, all the Wines on the Globe may be &s;o imitated, that neither Eye, nor Palate, nor the Perception of their Effects on Animal Bo|dies, can di&s;cover the Fiction; and this without one Drop of the Juice of the Grape, from the &s;accharine Quality only of almo&s;t all Fruits, Seeds,
<PB N="184" REF="191">
or Herbs: yet by analy&s;ing them in &s;ome proper Men&s;truum, the Cheat may be found out. Thus we may imitate all the &s;everal Mineral Waters on the Earth, and pretty nearly conciliate all their general or gro&s;&s;er &s;alutary Virtues on di&s;ea&s;ed Ani|mals: yet there is an unaccountable Something in the Ta&s;te, Lightne&s;s on the Stomach, Chear|fulne&s;s and Alacrity they give, which all our Skill can never be&s;tow. The Principle of In|dividuation, the Size of their la&s;t and lea&s;t Par|ticles, the Proportion of the &s;everal Parts of the Compo&s;ition to the watry Men&s;truum, and the due Time of their Impregnation, are and ever will be unknown to us; as will con&s;equently the Degree required to wind up, &s;trengthen and con|tract the relaxed Solids of di&s;ea&s;ed human Bodies, to &s;uch a Height, that they may be enabled to grind, di&s;&s;olve, and thin the concreted Juices, as the&s;e active, &s;trong, and invigorating Waters of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> u&s;ually do: for in all robu&s;t Con|&s;titutions but partially depraved, in the cold chronical Di&s;tempers of &s;uch Habits, in nervous Di&s;orders, and low Spirits, in weak Dige&s;tions, and gro&s;s Habits, they are extremely &s;ucce&s;sful, e&s;pecially in the hotter Sea&s;ons of the Year."</Q>
Thus far this learned Gentleman.</P>
<P>During the time I was at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> formerly, I made an Excur&s;ion to <HI>Knowl-hou&s;e,</HI> about Seven Miles from <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and One from <HI>Sevenoak,</HI> be|longing to the Duke of <HI>Dor&s;et:</HI> it is &s;ituated in the Middle of a Park, and at that time was an antient Stone Fabrick; but had nothing more remarkable in it, than &s;ome excellent Pictures.</P>
<P>I left <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and came to <HI>Lewes,</HI> through the deepe&s;t, dirtie&s;t, but in many re&s;pects the riche&s;t, and mo&s;t profitable Country in all that Part of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="192">The Timber I &s;aw here was prodigious, as well for Size as Plenty, and &s;eemed in &s;ome Places &s;uffered to grow, only becau&s;e it was &s;o far off of any Na|vigation, that it was not worth carrying away. In dry Summers, indeed, a great deal is carried away to <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> and other Places on the <HI>Medway</HI>; and &s;ometimes I have &s;een one Tree on a Carriage, which they call there a <HI>Tug,</HI> drawn by 22 Oxen; and even then 'tis carried &s;o little a Way, (being thrown down, and left for other <HI>Tugs</HI> to take up, and carry on) that &s;ometimes 'tis Two or Three Years before it gets to <HI>Chatham</HI>; for if once the Rains begin, it &s;tirs no more that Year, and &s;ometimes a whole Summer is not dry enough to make the Roads pa&s;&s;able.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall ob&s;erve, according to my Pro|mi&s;e, <HI>p.</HI> 151. That in the Year 1739-40, an Act pa&s;&s;ed, intituled, <HI>An Act to revive, explain and amend an Act made in the</HI> 16<HI>th and</HI> 17<HI>th Years of the Reign of his late Maje&s;ty K.</HI> Charles II. <HI>intituled, An Act for making the River of</HI> Medway <HI>navigable, in the Counties of</HI> Kent <HI>and</HI> Su&s;&s;ex: And which, when completed, mu&s;t be of very great U&s;e to the Publick, as well as to the Counties of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>The Preamble to this Act will &s;et this Matter in a proper Light, and it is to this Effect; That the above-mentioned Act of Parliament of the 16th and 17th of <HI>Charles</HI> II. was never yet carried into Exe|cution; altho' the making the &s;aid River navigable was likely to be of great Utility to the Publick, by rea&s;on of great Quantities of Timber growing on the <HI>Wealds</HI> of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> which is allowed to be the be&s;t in the Kingdom, for the U&s;e of the Royal Navy, and which now, thro' the Badne&s;s of the Roads in tho&s;e Parts, cannot be convey'd to any Market but at a large Expence.</P>
<P>That therefore the pre&s;ent Undertakers, being de&s;irous to begin, carry on and complete the Navi|gation
<PB N="186" REF="193">
of &s;uch Part of the antient River <HI>Medway</HI> and Streams falling into it, as run from <HI>Fore&s;t-row</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> to <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> this Act incorporates them for that Purpo&s;e, by the Name of <HI>The Com|pany of Proprietors of the Navigation of the River</HI> Medway.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t refer to the Act it&s;elf for farther Parti|culars, and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, That when this Work is completed, it will be of inconceivable Ad|vantage to the Publick; not only for the excellent Timber which it will be a Means of conveying to proper Markets, but for the ea&s;y and &s;peedy Carriage of Iron, Ordnance, Balls, and other Materials of War forged in or near the &s;aid River, which at &s;ome times of the Year cannot be brought thro' the <HI>Wealds</HI> of the Two Counties; and for the Carriage of Wood, Corn, Grain, Hay, Hops, Wooll, Leather, and all manner of Provi&s;ions, as al&s;o of Coals, Lime, Stone Wares, and all other Nece&s;&s;aries and Commodities, to the great Improvement of Trade and Commerce.</P>
<P>A few Miles North-we&s;t of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> lies <HI>Seven|oak,</HI> &s;o called from Seven large Oaks that grew near the Place. It is a Market-town, governed by a Warden and A&s;&s;i&s;tants; but is noted for nothing more than being a great Thorough-fare Town. It has a good Ho&s;pital for maintaining and teaching poor Children, erected by Sir <HI>William Sevenoak,</HI> Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> who was a Foundling, and took his Name from the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Lewes</HI> is a plea&s;ant Town, large, well-built, agree|ably &s;ituated in the Middle of an open Champain Country, and on the Edge of the <HI>South-downs,</HI> the mo&s;t delightful of their Kind in the Nation; it lies on the Bank of a little whol&s;ome fre&s;h River, within 12 Miles of the Sea, and was formerly in|compa&s;&s;ed with a Wall; but there are few Re|mains of it now to be &s;een. But what contributes to the Advantage of this Town is, that both it and
<PB N="187" REF="194">
the Country adjacent, are full of Gentlemen of good Families and Fortunes; of which the <HI>Pelhams</HI> mu&s;t be named with the fir&s;t, who&s;e Chief is his Grace the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI> Here are al&s;o the antient Families of <HI>Gage, Shelly,</HI> &amp;c. formerly Roman-catholicks, but now Prote&s;tants, with many others, <HI>Lewes</HI> has Five Churches in it. Near it is an old demoli&s;h'd Ca&s;tle, in the Neighbourhood of which was fought that bloody Battle between King <HI>Henry</HI> III. and his Barons; the Event of which con&s;trained the King to accept of hard Conditions of Peace, and to give his Son as an Ho&s;tage for Per|formance.</P>
<P>I ought not to forget, that <HI>Newhaven</HI> in this Neighbourhood was formerly noted for its &s;afe and good Harbour for Ships of con&s;iderable Burden; but for want of a Provi&s;ion for maintaining the Timber Piers, which it had for Time immemorial, it was quite neglected, and the Harbour choaked up with Sand and Beach, and the Piers were rotten and decay'd. To remedy the&s;e Evils, an Act pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>Anno</HI> 1731, for Repairing and Keeping in Repair the &s;aid Piers and Harbour. And when brought to Effect, not only <HI>Lewes,</HI> but the adjacent Parts, as well as the whole Kingdom, will be the better for it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lewes,</HI> following &s;till the Range of the <HI>South-Downs,</HI> We&s;t, we ride in View of the Sea, and on a fine Carpet Ground, for about 12 Miles to <HI>Brighthelm&s;ton,</HI> a poor Fi&s;hing-town, old-built, and on the very Shore of the Sea. Hence again, as I mentioned at <HI>Folk&s;tone</HI> and <HI>Dover,</HI> the Fi&s;hermen, having large Barks, go away to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> to the Fi&s;hing Fair there, and hire them&s;elves out for the Sea&s;on to catch Herrings for the Merchants; and they tell us, that the&s;e make a very good Bu&s;ine&s;s of it.</P>
<P>The Sea is very unkind to <HI>Brighthelm&s;ton,</HI> having by its continual Encroachments, &s;o gained upon
<PB N="188" REF="195">
the Town, that in a little time more the Inhabitants may rea&s;onably expect it will eat away the whole Place, above 100 Hou&s;es having been devoured by the Water in a few Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>From hence, &s;till keeping the Coa&s;t on the Left, we come to <HI>Shoreham,</HI> a Sea-faring Town, chiefly inhabited by Ship-carpenters, Ship-chandlers, and all the &s;everal Trades depending upon the Building and Fitting up of Ships, which is their chief Bu&s;ine&s;s. They are indeed ju&s;tly noted for good Sailors, and for building neat and &s;tout Sea-boats, which yet, in Strength and Duration, do not come up to tho&s;e of <HI>Yarmouth, Ip&s;wich,</HI> and the North.</P>
<P>The Builders of Ships &s;eem to have &s;ettled here chiefly becau&s;e of the exceeding Quantity and Cheapne&s;s of Timber in the Country behind them; being the &s;ame wooded Country I mentioned above, which &s;till continues thro' this County and the next. The River this Town &s;tands upon, tho' not navigable for large Ve&s;&s;els, yet &s;erves to bring down this large Timber in Floats from <HI>Bramber, Steyning,</HI> and the Country adjacent; which is, in a manner, all co|vered over with Timber.</P>
<P>Here in the Compa&s;s of about Six Miles are Three Borough Towns, &s;ending Members to Parliament, <HI>(viz.) Shoreham, Bramber,</HI> and <HI>Steyning. Shoreham</HI> and <HI>Steyning</HI> are pretty little Market-towns; but <HI>Bramber,</HI> after I have mentioned the Ruins of an old Ca&s;tle, hardly de&s;erves the Name of a Town, having not above 20 Families in it, and of them but few above a&s;king Alms, as you ride by. The chief Hou&s;e in the Town, when I was there, was a Pub|lick-hou&s;e, the Landlord whereof boa&s;ted, that upon an Election, ju&s;t then over, he had made 300<HI>l.</HI> of one Pipe of Canary.</P>
<P>This is not the only Town in this County, where the Elections have been &s;candalou&s;ly mercenary, in|&s;omuch that it has been &s;aid, there was in one King's
<PB N="189" REF="196">
Reign more Money &s;pent at Elections than all the Lands in the Pari&s;hes were worth, at 20 Years Purcha&s;e. I &s;hall name in particular but one more, and that is <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> which is rather the Skeleton of an antient City, than a real Town, where the old Gates &s;tand near Three Miles from one another over the Fields, and the very Ruins are &s;o buried, that they have made good Corn Fields of the Streets, and the Plough goes over the Foundations, nay, over the fir&s;t Floors of the Hou&s;es, and where nothing of a Town &s;eems to remain; yet at one Election for Members, the Struggle was &s;uch, between Sir <HI>John Banks,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Draper</HI> a neighbouring Gentle|man, that I was a&s;&s;ured the latter &s;pent 11,000<HI>l.</HI> and lo&s;t it too. What the other &s;pent, who oppo&s;ed him, may be gue&s;&s;ed at, &s;eeing he who &s;pent mo&s;t was always &s;ure to carry it.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Steyning,</HI> the famous Baronet of the Name of <HI>Fagg</HI> hath an antient Seat. And thence pa&s;&s;ing by the Seat of Sir <HI>John Shelly,</HI> prettily &s;ituated in the Middle of a Grove, we come to <HI>Arundel,</HI> a decay'd Town al&s;o. It &s;tands near the Mouth of the River <HI>Arun,</HI> which heretofore had a good Harbour called <HI>Arundel Port,</HI> or the Harbour of <HI>Little Hampton,</HI> capable of receiving Ships and Ve&s;&s;els of a con|&s;iderable Burden; but a Beach being thrown up by the Sea, it was quite choaked up, and the Navigation of the <HI>Arun</HI> ob&s;tructed, &s;o that the Harbour was rendered in a manner u&s;ele&s;s. But in the Year 1733, an Act pa&s;&s;ed for erecting Piers in, and for Repair|ing and Keeping in Repair the Harbour there, by cutting a Chanel thro' the Beach and old Piers, and erecting Locks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>One great Advantage to the Country from this River, is the Shipping off great Quantities of large Timber here; which is carried up the <HI>Thames</HI> to <HI>Woolwich</HI> and <HI>Deptford,</HI> and up the <HI>Medway</HI> to <HI>Chatham</HI>; as al&s;o We&s;tward to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and even
<PB N="190" REF="197">
to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> to the new Dock there, and indeed to all the King's Yards, where the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Navy is carried on. The Timber &s;hipped off here is e&s;teemed the be&s;t and large&s;t that is brought by Sea from any Part of <HI>England</HI>; al&s;o great Quantities of Knee Timber are had here, the large&s;t of which is valuable in its kind above the &s;trait Timber.</P>
<P>This River, and the old, decay'd, once famous Ca&s;tle at <HI>Arundel,</HI> which has the Privilege to give to its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or the Title of an Earl and Peer of the Realm, without Creation, and which belongs to the noble Family of <HI>Howard,</HI> Earls of <HI>Arundel,</HI> and Dukes of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> is all that is remarkable here; except it be, that in the Church are Four old and &s;tately Monuments of the Earls of <HI>Arundel,</HI> and that in this River are catch'd the be&s;t and large&s;t Mullets in <HI>England,</HI> a Fi&s;h very good in it&s;elf, and much valued by the Gentry round, and often &s;ent up to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>From hence to the City of <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> are 12 of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and beautiful Miles in <HI>England,</HI> whether we go by the Hill, or Downs, or by the Plain, or inclo&s;ed Country.</P>
<P>To the North of <HI>Arundel,</HI> and at the Bottom of the Hills, and con&s;equently in the <HI>Weald,</HI> is the Town of <HI>Petworth,</HI> a large hand&s;ome Country Market-town, and very populous; and as it &s;tands upon an A&s;cent, and is dry and healthy, it is full of Gentle|mens Families, and good well-built Hou&s;es, both in the Town and Neighbourhood; but the Beauty of <HI>Petworth</HI> is the antient Seat of the old Family of <HI>Piercy,</HI> Earls of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> now extinct; who&s;e Daughter, the &s;ole Heire&s;s of all his va&s;t E&s;tates, married <HI>Charles Seymour</HI> Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI>; and among other noble Seats brought his Grace this of <HI>Petworth.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke pull'd down the antient Hou&s;e, and on the &s;ame Spot built from the Ground one of the
<PB N="191" REF="198">
be&s;t-modell'd Hou&s;es then in <HI>Britain:</HI> it had the Misfortune to be once almo&s;t demoli&s;hed by Fire, but the Damage has been fully repaired.</P>
<P>The Apartments are very noble, well contrived, and richly furni&s;hed; but it cannot be &s;aid, that the Situation of the Hou&s;e is cho&s;en &s;o happily, as to boa&s;t of equal Judgment with the re&s;t; the Avenues to the Front want Space, the Hou&s;e &s;tands, as it were, with its Elbow to the Town; its Front has no <HI>Vi&s;ta</HI> an&s;werable, and the We&s;t Front look'd not to the Parks or fine Gardens, but to the old Stables.</P>
<P>To rectify this, when it was too late to order it any other way, the Duke was obliged to pull down tho&s;e noble Buildings; I mean the Meu&s;e, or Stables, the fine&s;t of their kind in all the South of <HI>England,</HI> and equal to &s;ome Noblemens whole Hou&s;es: and yet even the demoli&s;hing the Pile has done no more than opened a Pro&s;pect over the Country, whereas, had the Hou&s;e been &s;et on the ri&s;ing Ground, on the Side of the Park, over-again&s;t the North Wing of the Hou&s;e, and a little more to the We&s;tward, the Front had been South to the Town, the back Front to the Parks; but now all the&s;e Advantages lie on one Angle, or oppo&s;ite to one Wing of the Hou&s;e. Neverthele&s;s it is a noble Pile of Building, and by far the fine&s;t in all this Part of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Petworth</HI> We&s;t, the Country is a little le&s;s woody than the <HI>Weald</HI>; and a great many fine Seats begin to &s;hew their Heads above the Trees; as the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI>'s Seat at <HI>Godwood,</HI> near <HI>Chi|che&s;ter</HI>; the Seats of the late Earl of <HI>Tankerville,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Scarborough</HI>; and a great many others.</P>
<P>But the Seat of the Right Honourable the Lord Vi&s;c. <HI>Montacute,</HI> called <HI>Cowdrey,</HI> near <HI>Midhur&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Midae</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> de&s;erves a particular Mention. It is &s;ituated in a Valley encompa&s;&s;ed with Lawns,
<PB N="192" REF="199">
Hills, and Woods, thrown into a Park, the River running underneath, which renders the Place very agreeable in Summer, but makes it dampi&s;h in Winter. The Hou&s;e is &s;quare, and at each Corner is a <HI>Gothick</HI> Tower, which have a very good Effect, when viewed from the ri&s;ing Grounds. The Hall is ceiled with <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Oak, after the antient manner. The Walls are painted with Architecture by <HI>Roberti,</HI> the Statues by <HI>Goup&eacute;,</HI> the Stair-ca&s;e by <HI>Pelegrini.</HI> The large Parlour or Room at the End of the Hall, is of <HI>Holbein</HI>'s Painting; where that great Arti&s;t has de&s;cribed the Exploits of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. before <HI>Boloigne, Calais,</HI> his Landing at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> his magnificent Entry into <HI>London,</HI> &amp;c. In the other Rooms are many excellent Pictures of the Ance&s;tors of the Family, and other Hi&s;tory Paintings of <HI>Hol|bein,</HI> relating to their Actions in War. The whole Circuit of Rooms are &s;tately and well-furni&s;hed, adorned with many Pictures. There is a long Gallery with the Twelve Apo&s;tles as big as the Life; another very neat one, wain&s;cotted with <HI>Norway</HI> Oak, where are many antient Whole-length Pictures of the Fa|mily, in their proper Habits. There are four Hi&s;tory-pieces, two Copies of <HI>Raphael</HI>'s Marriage of <HI>Cupid</HI> and <HI>P&s;yche</HI>; &s;everal old religious and military Paint|ings from <HI>Battle-abbey.</HI></P>
<P>The Park is very noble, having a great Variety of Grounds in it, and is well wooded with <HI>Pines, Firs,</HI> and other Evergreen-trees, which are grown to a large Size; and here are &s;ome of the large&s;t Che&s;nut-trees perhaps in <HI>England.</HI> The Valleys which run thro' the Park, are well &s;upplied with Water, which keeps the Gra&s;s in a con&s;tant Verdure.</P>
<P><HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> is a neat and pretty large City walled round. The River <HI>Lavant</HI> runs under Part of the Walls. Two principal Streets cro&s;s it at right Angles upon the cardinal Points, where &s;tands a curious
<PB N="193" REF="200">
Cro&s;s, and Market-hou&s;e upon Pillars, erected by Bi&s;hop <HI>Read.</HI> The Church takes up one of the&s;e Quadrants. It is remarkable for Two Side-i&s;les on both Sides, and the Pictures of all the Kings and Queens of <HI>England</HI> &s;ince <HI>Ci&s;&s;a,</HI> (the South <HI>Saxon</HI> Monarch, who made this his Royal Seat; and repaired the antient <HI>Roman</HI> Ca&s;tle or Walls, leaving his Name to the Place) on the Southern Wall, as on the op|po&s;ite Wall, all the Bi&s;hops. The Spire is a Piece of excellent Workman&s;hip, but it received &s;uch a Shock &s;ome Years ago, that it was almo&s;t miracu|lous, that the Steeple did not fall down; which, if it had, would probably have demoli&s;hed the whole Church.</P>
<P>It was what the Inhabitants call a Fire-ball, or rather Lightning, which broke upon the Steeple, with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible Force, that it drove &s;everal great Stones out of it, and carried them clear off, to a prodigious Di&s;tance from the Steeple. One of the&s;e Stones, of at lea&s;t a Ton Weight, was blown over the South Side or Row of Hou&s;es in the We&s;t Street, and fell on the Ground in the Street, at a Gentleman's Door, on the other Side of the Way: and another of them, almo&s;t as big, was blown over both Sides of the &s;aid We&s;t Street, into the &s;ame Gentleman's Garden, and no Hurt done by either of them. This Account I relate from a Per&s;on of undoubted Credit, who was an Eye-witne&s;s, and &s;aw the Stones. The Breach made thereby in the Spire, tho' within about 45 Feet of the Top, was incredibly large, and yet the Steeple &s;tood fa&s;t, and is now very &s;ub&s;tantially repaired; which &s;hews, that it was originally an admirably &s;ound and well fini&s;hed Piece of Workman&s;hip. The Monuments of Bi&s;hop <HI>Carleton</HI> and Bi&s;hop <HI>King</HI> are in this Church, who&s;e Effigies are curiou&s;ly done in Marble.</P>
<P>In the Year 1723, in digging a Foundation at <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> was found, pretty deep in the Ground, a
<PB N="194" REF="201">
large Stone Six Feet long and Three broad, with a <HI>Roman</HI> In&s;cription on it. In digging up the Stone, a few of the Letters were eras'd, but they were ea&s;ily &s;upplied.<Q><HI>Neptuno et Minervae Templum, pro &s;alute domus divinae, ex auctoritate Tiberii Claudii, Cogidubni regis, legati Augu&s;ti in Britannia, Collegium fa|brorum, et qui in eo a &s;acris, vel honorati &s;unt, de &s;uo dedicaverunt; donante aream Pudente Pudentini filio.</HI></Q> <HI>That is,</HI>
<Q>This Temple was dedicated to <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Mi|nerva,</HI> for the Safety of the Imperial Family, by the Authority of <HI>Tiberius Claudius.</HI> It was erected by the College of Artificers of King <HI>Cogidubnus, Augu&s;tus</HI>'s Lieutenant in <HI>Britain,</HI> and by tho&s;e who officiated as Prie&s;ts, or were honoured in it, at their own Expence; the Ground being given by <HI>Pudens,</HI> the Son of <HI>Pu|dentinus.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This Stone was pre&s;ented to his Grace the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> who has placed it in a Temple on a Mount in his Garden at <HI>Godwood,</HI> between two Sta|tues of <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Minerva.</HI></P>
<P>This City is not a Place of much Trade, nor is it very populous; but within the&s;e few Years they are fallen into a new way of managing the Corn Trade here, which turns very well to Account; for whereas the Farmers, generally &s;peaking, u&s;ed to carry all their Wheat to <HI>Farnham</HI> Market, which is very near Forty Miles by Land-carriage, and from &s;ome Parts of the Country more than that, &s;ome money'd Men of <HI>Chiche&s;ter, Em&s;worth,</HI> and other Places adjacent, join'd their Stocks together, and built large Granaries near the <HI>Crook,</HI> where the Ve&s;&s;els come up; and here they buy and lay up all
<PB N="195" REF="202">
the Corn which the Country on that Side can &s;pare; and having good Mills in the Neighbourhood, they grind and dre&s;s the Corn, and &s;end it to <HI>London</HI> in the Meal, by long Sea.</P>
<P>This is a great le&s;&s;ening to <HI>Farnham</HI> Market; but if the Market at <HI>London</HI> is &s;upply'd, the coming by Sea from <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> is every whit as much a pub|lick Good, as the encouraging of <HI>Farnham</HI> Market, which is of it&s;elf the greate&s;t Corn-market in <HI>Eng|land; Hemp&s;tead</HI> in <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> ex|cepted. This carrying of Meal by Sea is now pra|cti&s;ed from &s;everal other Places on this Coa&s;t, even as far as <HI>Southampton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> be&s;ides the Cathedral, has Five &s;mall Churches. About Three Miles from it, is a Hou&s;e of his Grace the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> called <HI>Godwood.</HI> It was the antient Seat of the Earls of <HI>Northum|berland,</HI> and in a very ruinous Condition; but the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> has lately built &s;ome Offices, which are to corre&s;pond with a Man&s;ion-hou&s;e de|&s;ign'd by <HI>Colin Campbel,</HI> and publi&s;h'd by him in his <HI>Vitruvius Britannicus.</HI></P>
<P>His Grace has a noble <HI>Menagerie,</HI> where he keeps a great Variety of foreign Animals and Birds; but the Park is &s;mall and ill-planted.</P>
<P>However, it has an ea&s;y De&s;cent to the Ea&s;t, South and South-we&s;t, with the Pro&s;pect of a rich and beautiful Land&s;kip, bounded by the Sea for Thirty Miles in Length. The <HI>I&s;le of Wight</HI> terminates the South-we&s;t Pro&s;pect, and the famous <HI>St. Rooks|hill</HI> covers it from the North.</P>
<P>About Three Miles to the Ea&s;t of <HI>Godwood,</HI> lies <HI>Charlton,</HI> a &s;mall Village, remarkable for being the Seat of Fox-hunters; here are many &s;mall Hunting-hou&s;es built by Per&s;ons of Quality, who re&s;ide there during the Sea&s;on for Fox-hunting; but the mo&s;t beautiful of the&s;e Buildings, is that of his Grace the Duke of <HI>Richmond.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="203">Here is al&s;o a large Room, which was de&s;ign'd by the Right Hon. the Earl of <HI>Burlington,</HI> where the Gentlemen Fox-hunters dine every Day toge|ther, during their Stay at the Village.</P>
<P>By the Side of this Village is a Fore&s;t, which was formerly in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Lumlies,</HI> but has been for &s;ome Years his Grace the Duke of <HI>Rich|mond</HI>'s, who has greatly beautified it, by cutting fine Ridings thro' the &s;everal Parts of it, and making many new Plantations therein.</P>
<P>From <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> the Road lying &s;till We&s;t, we pa&s;s in Sight of the Earl of <HI>Scarborough</HI>'s fine Seat at <HI>Stan&s;ted,</HI> a Hou&s;e &s;urrounded with thick Woods, thro' which there are the mo&s;t agreeable Vi&s;ta's cut, that are to be &s;een any-where in <HI>Eng|land</HI>; and particularly at the We&s;t Opening, which is from the Front of the Hou&s;e, they &s;it in the Dine|ing-room, and &s;ee the Town and Harbour of <HI>Port&s;|mouth,</HI> the Ships at <HI>Spithead,</HI> and al&s;o at <HI>St. Helen</HI>'s; which, when the Royal Navy happens to be there, is a mo&s;t glorious Sight.</P>
<P>In our Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> we pa&s;s'd by <HI>Fare|ham,</HI> and by <HI>Portche&s;ter,</HI> a Ca&s;tle built out of a <HI>Roman</HI> City.</P>
<P>In <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> Haven a Thou&s;and Sail of the big|ge&s;t Ships may ride &s;ecure. The Mouth is not &s;o broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and that &s;ecur'd on <HI>Go&s;port</HI> Side by <HI>Charles</HI> Fort, <HI>James</HI> Fort, <HI>Bo|rough</HI> Fort, and <HI>Block-hou&s;e</HI> Fort, which has a Plat-form of above 20 great Guns level with the Water. On the other Side by <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> &s;tands <HI>South-&s;ea</HI> Ca&s;tle, built by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. The Govern|ment has within the&s;e few Years bought more Ground for additional Works, and no doubt it may be made impregnable; for a &s;hallow Water may be brought quite round it. The Yards, the Docks, the Store-hou&s;es, where all the Furniture is laid up
<PB N="197" REF="204">
in the exacte&s;t Order, &s;o that the Workmen can find any Implement in the Dark, exceed Imagina|tion; as do the immen&s;e Quantities of all &s;orts of military and naval Stores. The Rope-hou&s;e is 870 Feet long, one continued Room, almo&s;t a Quarter of a Mile. I had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing a great Cable made here: it requires 100 Men to work at it, and &s;o hard is the Labour, that they can work but Four Hours in the Day. The &s;malle&s;t Number of Men continually employed in the Yard is 1000, and that but barely &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a good Counter&s;carp, and double Mote, with Ravelins in the Ditch, and double Pali&s;adoes, and advanc'd Works to cover the Place from any Approach, where it may be practicable. The Strength of the Town is al&s;o con&s;iderably aug|mented on the Land-&s;ide, by the Fortifications rai&s;ed of late Years about the Docks and Yards; and tho&s;e Parts made a particular Strength by them&s;elves; and tho' they are indeed in &s;ome Sen&s;e independent one of another, yet they cover and &s;trengthen one another, &s;o that they cannot be &s;eparately attack'd on that Side, while they are both in the &s;ame Hands.</P>
<P><HI>Edw.</HI> IV. began the&s;e Fortifications; <HI>Henry</HI> VII. con&s;iderably augmented them; <HI>Charles</HI> II. much im|prov'd them; and King <HI>James</HI> II. greatly added to them. I was &s;orry to leave this amazing Scene of naval Grandeur, for the Sight of a wretched Sta|tue of King <HI>William</HI> III. gilt indeed in an extraor|dinary manner, but the very wor&s;t of all the bad Works of this kind I have yet &s;een. I ob&s;erv'd the great Quantity of Water and Ditches hereabout is apt to render the Place agui&s;h.</P>
<P>The&s;e Docks and Yards are now like a Town by them&s;elves, and are a kind of Marine Corporation within them&s;elves; there being particular large Rows of Dwellings, built at the publick Charge, within the new Works, for all the principal Officers of the
<PB N="198" REF="205">
Place; e&s;pecially the Commi&s;&s;ioner, the Agent of the Victualling, and &s;uch-like.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> is a well inhabited, thriving Corporation; and hath been greatly enriched of late by the Fleet's having &s;o often and &s;o long lain there, as well as large Fleets of Merchant-men; be&s;ides, the con&s;tant fitting out of Men of War here, and the often paying them at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> has made a great Re&s;ort of People to it. Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> &s;o long ago as the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> takes notice, that <HI>Port&s;|mouth was populous in time of War, but not &s;o in time of Peace:</HI> but now the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Navy is &s;o much increa&s;ed, and &s;o much of it always done here, that it may be &s;aid, that there is more to do at <HI>Port&s;|mouth</HI> now in time of Peace, than was then in time of War.</P>
<P>The Government of the Place is by a Mayor and Aldermen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Civil Government is no more interrupted by the Military, than if there was no Gari&s;on there: &s;o that we have very &s;eldom had any Complaint either of Want of Di&s;cipline among the Soldiers, or Want of Prudence in the Magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>Since the Increa&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s at this Place, the Confluence of People has been &s;o great, that the Town not admitting any Inlargement for Buildings, a kind of Suburb, or rather a new Town, has been built on the heathy Ground adjoining, which is &s;o con&s;iderable, that it threatens to outdo, for Numbers of Inhabitants, and Beauty of Buildings, even the Town it&s;elf; and the rather, as it is unconfin'd by the Laws of the Gari&s;on, and unincumber'd with the Corporation Burdens, Freedoms, Town-duties, Ser|vices, and the like.</P>
<P>Next we arriv'd at the <HI>Port&s;down</HI> Hills, which are of Chalk, and at a rea&s;onable Di&s;tance from the Shore extend them&s;elves into <HI>Su&s;&s;ex.</HI></P>
<P>Here we turn'd to admire the Face of the Ground we had pa&s;s'd. The Ports, Creeks, Bays, Ocean,
<PB N="199" REF="206">
Ca&s;tles and Ships, the <HI>I&s;le of Wight, Portche&s;ter,</HI> the con&s;iderable Town of <HI>Go&s;port, Port&s;mouth, Southamp|ton, Chiche&s;ter,</HI> and all the Coa&s;t from <HI>Portland</HI> I&s;le to <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> were comprehended under one View.</P>
<P>From <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> We&s;t, the Country lies low and flat, is full of Creeks and Inlets of the Sea and Ri|vers, all the Way to <HI>Southampton,</HI> &s;o that we ferry over three times in about 18 Miles; be&s;ides going over the Bridge at <HI>Tichfield.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e Fer|ries is at <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> it&s;elf, <HI>(viz.)</HI> cro&s;s the Mouth of the Harbour, from the <HI>Point</HI> above-mention'd, to <HI>Go&s;port,</HI> a large Town, and of great Trade, e&s;pe|cially in time of War. From thence we ride to <HI>Tich|field</HI> as above, where we pa&s;s the River <HI>Alre,</HI> which ri&s;es in the &s;ame County at <HI>Alresford,</HI> or near it, which is not above Twenty-two Miles off; and yet it is a large River here, and makes a good Road below, call'd <HI>Tichfield-bay.</HI> Thence at about Four Miles we pa&s;s another River at <HI>Bu&s;&s;elton,</HI> narrow in Breadth, but exceeding deep, and eminent for its being able to carry the large&s;t Ships: here is a Build|ing-yard for Ships of War; and in King <HI>William</HI>'s Time, Two Eighty-gun Ships were launch'd here. It &s;eems, the Safety of the Creek, and the Plenty of Timber in the Country behind it, is the Rea&s;on of Building &s;o much in this Place.</P>
<P>From hence, when we come oppo&s;ite to <HI>South|ampton,</HI> we pa&s;s another Creek, being the Mouth of the River <HI>Alre,</HI> which comes down from <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and is both very broad and deep; and the Ferry|men having a very &s;orry Boat, we found it danger|ous enough pa&s;&s;ing it. On the oppo&s;ite Bank &s;tands the antient Town of <HI>Southampton,</HI> on the other Side of which comes down another large River, called the <HI>Te&s;t,</HI> entring <HI>Southampton</HI> Water by <HI>Red-bridge</HI>; &s;o that the Town of <HI>Southampton</HI> &s;tands upon a Point running out into the Sea, between Two very fine Rivers, both navigable for &s;ome Way up the Coun|try,

and particularly u&s;eful for the bringing down Timber out of one of the be&s;t wooded Counties in <HI>Britain</HI>; for the River on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Town comes by the Edge of <HI>New-fore&s;t:</HI> here we &s;aw a prodigious Quantity of Timber, of an uncommon Size, va&s;tly large, lying on the Shore of the River, for above Two Miles in Length, which they told us was brought thither from the Fore&s;t, and left there to be fetch'd by the Builders at <HI>Port&s;mouth-dock,</HI> as they had Occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>In riding over the South Part of <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> I made this Ob&s;ervation, That notwith&s;tanding the very great Con&s;umption of Timber &s;ince the Revo|lution, by Building or Rebuilding almo&s;t the whole Navy; and notwith&s;tanding &s;o many of the King's Ships were built hereabouts, be&s;ides abundance of large Merchant-&s;hips, which were about that time built at <HI>Southampton,</HI> at <HI>Red-bridge,</HI> and at <HI>Bu&s;&s;elton, &amp;c.</HI> yet I &s;aw the Gentlemens E&s;tates, within Six, Eight, or Ten Miles of <HI>Southampton,</HI> &s;o over-grown with Wood, and their Woods &s;o full of large well|grown Timber, that it &s;eem'd as if they wanted Sale for it, and that it was of little Worth to them. In one E&s;tate at <HI>Hur&s;eley</HI> in particular near <HI>Win|che&s;ter,</HI> formerly belonging to Mr. <HI>Cromwell,</HI> Grand|&s;on to <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> tho' the whole E&s;tate was not above 800<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> in Rent, they might have cut Twenty thou&s;and Pounds worth of Timber down, and yet have left the Woods in a thriving Con|dition; in another E&s;tate between that and <HI>Peter&s;|field,</HI> of about 1000<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> they told me they could fell a Thou&s;and Pounds a Year in good large Timber fit for Building, for Twenty Years together, and do the Woods no Harm. The late Colonel <HI>Norton</HI> al&s;o, who&s;e Seat at <HI>Southwick</HI> was within Six Miles of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and within Three of the Wa|ter-carriage, had, as I was told, at that time, an immen&s;e Quantity of Timber upon it, &s;ome growing

within Sight of the very Docks in <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> Far|ther We&s;t it is all the &s;ame, and as I rode thro' <HI>New|fore&s;t,</HI> I &s;aw the antient Oaks of many hundred Years &s;tanding, grown white with Age, and peri&s;h|ing with their wither'd Tops in the Air.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give other Hints of the like, when I come to &s;peak of <HI>Hertford&s;hire, Buckingham&s;hire, Berk|&s;hire,</HI> and the Counties which we call Inland, where the Timber is but of &s;mall Value, for want of Wa|ter-carriage to bring it away; likewi&s;e again of the Counties Northward, bordering upon the <HI>Humber,</HI> and upon all the Northern Rivers, not to &s;ay a Word of <HI>Ireland</HI>; which is &s;till a Store-hou&s;e of Timber, more inexhau&s;tible, if po&s;&s;ible, than <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But having mention'd the late Col. <HI>Norton,</HI> we cannot pa&s;s over in Silence his extraordinary Will, which made &s;o much Noi&s;e in the World.</P>
<P>This Gentleman dy'd in <HI>Dec.</HI> 1732, and left his Real E&s;tate of about 6000<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> and a Per|&s;onal, &s;aid to be to the Value of 60,000<HI>l.</HI> to the
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Poor, Hungry, and Thir&s;ty, Naked and Stran|gers, Sick and Wounded, and Pri&s;oners, to the End of the World."</Q>
And appointed the Parlia|ment of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to be his Executors; and in ca&s;e of their Refu&s;al, the Bi&s;hops; and left his Pictures, and other Valuables to the King. But his Will has been &s;ince &s;et a&s;ide on the &s;core of In&s;anity, &s;trong Marks of which it carry'd in the Face of it.</P>
<P>This Gentleman was famous for acting &s;everal Parts in Plays with great Propriety, particularly the Part of <HI>Fal&s;taff</HI> in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s <HI>Henry the Fourth,</HI> and the <HI>Merry Wives of Wind&s;or,</HI> at a neat Theatre erected by him&s;elf, at his Hou&s;e at <HI>Southwick,</HI> to which, in a Vacation, he often drew down and en|tertain'd the mo&s;t celebrated <HI>London</HI> Actors.</P>
<P>This Gentleman's Seat at <HI>Southwick</HI> was formerly an old Mona&s;tery, and many of the Walls of it are yet remaining; the Hou&s;e being a Part of it: the Situa|tion
<PB N="202" REF="209">
is very low and wet, having a great deal of boggy Ground about it; but from the Hou&s;e the Park ri&s;es to the highe&s;t Point of <HI>Port&s;down,</HI> mention'd above, where there are two very large Clumps of <HI>Scots</HI> Fir-trees, which were planted by the late Col. <HI>Norton,</HI> and have thriven &s;o well (tho' greatly expo&s;ed to the Sea Winds) as to become a Land-mark at a con&s;ider|able Di&s;tance at Sea, and may be &s;een near Twenty Miles at Land. Between the&s;e two Clumps of Trees, I was informed, that Gentleman intended to have erected a lofty Building; which mu&s;t have had an exceeding good Effect: for from the level Ground on this Spot, you have a full View of <HI>Port&s;|mouth</HI> Town, Harbour and Docks, under the Eye; and <HI>St. Helen</HI>'s in the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> is another Point of View, with an unbounded Pro&s;pect of the Sea to the South-ea&s;t; and on the Land-&s;ide, a large ex|ten&s;ive Vale, well planted and cultivated, bounded with Hills &s;pread with Woods, and the <HI>South downs</HI> covered with Sheep, ju&s;t under the Eye; &s;o that this Pro&s;pect may be ju&s;tly e&s;teemed one of the fine&s;t in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Southampton</HI> is a truly antient Town, which hav|ing been many Years decaying in its Trade, of late has very much improv'd in that of <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines, which are imported here and &s;ent into many Places inland, where formerly the <HI>London</HI> Merchants u&s;ed to deal; and that in great mea&s;ure owing to the Du|ties being ea&s;ier at <HI>Southampton</HI> than at <HI>London.</HI> They al&s;o carry on &s;ome Trade with the I&s;les of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI>; and not a little, as their Enemies &s;ay, of the Smuggling Trade. The Town is large and populous, has a fair High-&s;treet, a &s;pacious Key; and, if its Trade &s;hould thoroughly revive, is able to con|tain great Numbers of People. There is a <HI>French</HI> Church, and no incon&s;iderable Congregation belong|ing to it. Here are &s;till &s;ome Merchants who trade to <HI>Newfoundland</HI> for Fi&s;h, which they carry to
<PB N="203" REF="210">
the <HI>Streights,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;ome Ship-building al&s;o is carried on here, tho' not near &s;o much as formerly.</P>
<P>This Town had formerly the &s;ole Privilege from the Crown of importing Wines from thence; which, tho' a va&s;t Advantage to it, the Corporation either wantonly or corruptly &s;old to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The Situation of <HI>Southampton</HI> between two Rivers was to its Advantage formerly, in point of Strength; and is be&s;ides &s;trongly wall'd with very large Stones, full of tho&s;e little white Shells, like Honey-combs, which grow upon the Back of Oy&s;ters. This is a &s;ort of Stone extremely hard, and &s;eems to be ga|ther'd near the Beach of the Sea. The&s;e Walls have many Lunets and Towers, in &s;ome Places double ditch'd; but the Sea encompa&s;&s;es near half the Town. It was built in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve they have a Method of breaking the Force of the Waves here, by laying a Bank of <HI>Sea-ore,</HI> as they call it. It is compo&s;ed of long, &s;lender and &s;trong Filaments, like pill'd Hemp, very tough and durable; I &s;uppo&s;e thrown up by the Sea: and this performs its Work better than Walls of Stone, or na|tural Cliff.</P>
<P>At the South-ea&s;t Corner, near the Quay, is a Fort with &s;ome Guns upon it, call'd the <HI>Tower.</HI> On one was an In&s;cription, denoting its being erected by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in the Year 1542. In the North-we&s;t Corner was a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, with a Mount, wall'd about at-top as a Keep: upon this a round Stone Tower, with a winding A&s;cent.</P>
<P>The Main of this Town con&s;i&s;ts of one broad Street, running thro' its Length. There are many old religious Ruins, and great Ware-hou&s;es, Cellars, Store-hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The old <HI>Roman</HI> City call'd <HI>Trau|&s;antum,</HI> &s;tood more Ea&s;tward upon the Banks of the River <HI>Itching,</HI> coming from <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> where now is a Hamlet nam'd <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s. There is a hand&s;ome new Church built upon the Ruins of an old one,
<PB N="204" REF="211">
which, they &s;ay, was burnt in &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Wars. It is near the pre&s;ent Ferry, and oppo&s;ite to <HI>Bittern,</HI> where was an old <HI>Roman</HI> Ca&s;tle, &s;urrounded with a Ditch, into which the Sea-water flow'd. It was ruin'd in the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Wars, and <HI>Southampton</HI> aro&s;e from its A&s;hes. This Place is memorable for the Ex|periment of King <HI>Canute,</HI> who to &s;ilence the vain Flattery of his Courtiers, &s;eated him&s;elf on the Banks of the River, with all his Regal Apparatus, and commanded the Tide not to approach his Foot&s;tool.</P>
<P>About a Mile from this Town, on the Banks of the River <HI>Itching,</HI> is a va&s;t large Pile of Earth, which ri&s;es in the Form of a Cone, from a large wide Foun|dation of great Extent and Circumference, which they call <HI>Bevis-Mount.</HI> It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an an|tient Fortification, thrown up by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> under the Command of <HI>Bevis,</HI> to oppo&s;e the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Danes</HI> over the River, who lay encamp'd on the other Side. The River is not very large, but the Tide running up into it a good Way beyond the Town, forms a kind of Bay ju&s;t under this great Mount, which being contiguous to an E&s;tate belonging to the late Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> his Lord&s;hip purcha&s;ed it, and converted it into a kind of Wilderne&s;s; and as it is full of Trees and Brambles, he has cut through them divers circular Walks and Labyrinths, &s;o very intricate, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to avoid being lo&s;t in them. His Lord&s;hip u&s;ed frequently to divert him&s;elf by dropping his Friends in the mid&s;t of this Wilderne&s;s, and, &s;tealing away, let them wander up and down, till they found their Way out of it. The Mount terminates above, as is feign'd of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> in a kind of Fork; and between the two Spires is a Bowling-green or Parterre, adorn'd with fine <HI>Italian</HI> Marble Statues, brought by his Lord&s;hip from abroad. It lies open on the Side-facing the River, and when the Tide is in, gives a mo&s;t agreeable Pro&s;pect. On one Side of this Parterre, declining gradually from the
<PB N="205" REF="212">
Top of one of the Spires to the Green, is planted a little Vineyard, expo&s;ed to the South; and on the other Side, on the very Summit of the Spire, &s;tands a fine Summer-hou&s;e, very elegantly built and contrived, with a good Cellar under it, where his Lord&s;hip kept his Wines, having no good Cellerage at his Hou&s;e, which is near a quarter of a Mile from the Mount, from which his Lord&s;hip called it <HI>Bevis-Mount.</HI> He intended to rebuild the Hou&s;e, and convert all the Grounds lying between it and the Mount, into Gardens, had he lived a little longer. The Beauty of the Improvements which his Lord&s;hip has made in this Mount, are hardly to be conceived. He has adorn'd it with Statues, Grottoes and Alcoves, and diver&s;ify'd it up and down with &s;omething new and &s;urpri&s;ing, at every turn, peculiar to his own fine Ta&s;te and Genius in Gardening, wherein no Nobleman excell'd, and few equall'd him in <HI>Europe.</HI> He left this little Seat, and Lands about it, to his Lady, who now enjoys them.</P>
<P>There are as many things fabled here of <HI>Bevis,</HI> as there are in <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Cornwall</HI> of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> both of whom have &s;uffer'd much from Legendary Writers and Tradition; for as King <HI>Arthur</HI> per|form'd many brave and valiant Acts in War, and was of great bodily Strength, &s;o <HI>Bevis,</HI> who was a <HI>Saxon</HI> Lord, was a Man of much military Courage and Conduct, as well as per&s;onally &s;trong. He was a great Oppo&s;er of the <HI>Normans,</HI> and followed them down to <HI>Wales,</HI> and gave them Battle, near <HI>Caerdiff,</HI> in <HI>Glamorgan&s;hire,</HI> but was there defeated. 'Tis &s;aid his Sword may be &s;till &s;een at <HI>Arundel</HI> Ca&s;tle; yet there are &s;ome who, from the Fables, with which their Stories are mingled, doubt whether ever there were &s;uch Per&s;ons as either of them.</P>
<P>I here took a Pa&s;&s;age over to the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> and in Two Hours arriv'd at <HI>Cowes,</HI> by the Way pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Cal&s;hot</HI> Ca&s;tle, where &s;ome Years ago were to be

<P><HI>Cowes</HI> is the chief Sea-port Town in this I&s;land; and in Time of War the general Place of Rendez|vous for Merchant-&s;hips waiting for Convoys, being &s;ecur'd, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by the Guns of the Ca|&s;tle, but more by the Neighbourhood of <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> We walked Four Miles, and came to</P>
<P><HI>Newport,</HI> the principal Town in the I&s;land; large and populous. At a pretty &s;trong Ca&s;tle, about a Mile di&s;tant, re&s;ides the Governor.</P>
<P>The I&s;land is very plea&s;ant, and &s;o fruitful, that one Year's Crop will &s;erve the Inhabitants for Seven Years; who therefore &s;upply <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and the Parts adjacent, with the Surplus. It abounds par|ticularly in Corn, Cattle, Hares, Rabbets, Wild|fowl, Fi&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is Sixty Miles in Circumfe|rence: its Militia is the be&s;t di&s;ciplined in <HI>England.</HI> Its Wool, in Finene&s;s, is next to that of <HI>Cot&s;wold.

Spithead</HI> between <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> and this I&s;land, and <HI>St. Helen</HI>'s, near to the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> are famous for the Rendezvous of the Royal Navy of <HI>England.

<P>This I&s;land is al&s;o noted for having been once ad|vanced to the Title of a Kingdom, by King <HI>Hen|ry</HI> VI. in behalf of <HI>Henry Beauchamp,</HI> Earl of <HI>War|wick,</HI> his great Favourite, who was crown'd King of <HI>Wight,</HI> and of the I&s;les of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> in 1445, but dying Two Years after, the I&s;le lo&s;t the Title of a Kingdom.

<P>Returning to <HI>Southampton,</HI> I was at the Extent of my intended Journey We&s;t, intending to look no farther this Way for the pre&s;ent. I went North-ea&s;t, leaving <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> a little on the Left, and came into the <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> Road at <HI>Petersfield,</HI> a Town chiefly noted for good Inns, and &s;tanding in the Middle of a Country overgrown with a prodigious Quantity of Oak-timber. From hence we came to <HI>Alton,</HI> and in the Road thither began a little to ta&s;te the Plea&s;ure of the We&s;tern Downs, which reach from <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> almo&s;t to that Place.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Bolton</HI> has Two very noble Seats in this Country, one between <HI>Alton</HI> and <HI>Alresford</HI>; and one at <HI>Ba&s;ing,</HI> of which hereafter. <HI>Alton</HI> is a &s;mall Market-town, of no Note, neither is there any con&s;iderable Manufacture in all this Part of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> except a little Drugget and Shalloon-making; otherwi&s;e the whole Counties of <HI>Kent, Su&s;&s;ex, Sur|rey</HI> and <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> are not employ'd in any con&s;ider|able Woollen Manufacture.</P>
<P>From <HI>Alton</HI> we came to <HI>Farnham,</HI> a large populous Market-town, the farthe&s;t that Way in the County of <HI>Surrey,</HI> from <HI>London</HI>; and, excepting <HI>Hemp&s;tead</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> as we ob&s;erv'd above, the greate&s;t Corn-market in <HI>England,</HI> particularly for Wheat, of which &s;o va&s;t a Quantity is brought hither every Market-day, that a Gentleman told me, he once counted 1100 Teams of Hor&s;e, all drawing Waggons, or Carts, loaden with Wheat; every Team of which is &s;uppo&s;ed to bring a Load, which is Forty Bu&s;hels, in the whole 44,000 Bu&s;hels; but I do not take upon me to affirm this for Truth of my own Knowledge, tho' I know &s;ome have thought the Quantity has been much more; but this al&s;o was, I &s;uppo&s;e, before the People of <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Em&s;worth</HI> on one Side,
<PB N="208" REF="215">
and <HI>Southampton, Tichfield,</HI> and <HI>Redbridge</HI> on the other, took to the Trade of &s;ending their Wheat in Meal to <HI>London</HI> by Sea, as I mentioned before.</P>
<P>The Toll-di&s;h, &s;ome Market-days, u&s;ed to amount to above a Load of Wheat; and yet about 100 Years ago, it was &s;o &s;hort of it, that one <HI>Bu&s;k,</HI> who&s;e Pro|perty it was, &s;old it for Forty Shillings; &s;o greatly was this Manufacture increa&s;ed within that Period. But if <HI>Farnham</HI> has been a Lo&s;er by the Method late|ly fallen upon by the People of <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>South|ampton,</HI> it has made it&s;elf amends by another Pro|duct, which it has taken to within the&s;e Twenty Years pa&s;t, and that is Hops, which it has &s;o va&s;tly improved in, that it may be &s;aid to outdo <HI>Canter|bury, Maid&s;tone,</HI> and any of the Places in <HI>Kent,</HI> mo&s;t noted for that Commodity; and this not only in Quantity, but Goodne&s;s. In &s;hort, all the Neigh|bourhood about <HI>Farnham</HI> is one general Hop-ground; and to &s;hew the Excellency of the Product, <HI>Farn|ham</HI> Hops now lead the Price at all the Markets in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>At this Town is a Ca&s;tle built by a Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> which has been in a con&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Bi&s;hops of the Dioce&s;e ever &s;ince King <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Time to this Day, and is their u&s;ual Place of Re&s;idence. This Palace is a magnificent Structure, deeply moated, and &s;trongly wall'd, with Towers at proper Di&s;tances. It &s;tands upon the Edge of an Hill, where is a fine Park. One large and broad Street of the Town below-hill fronts the Ca&s;tle. The Main of the re&s;t of the Town, con|&s;i&s;ts of a long &s;trait Street, cro&s;&s;ing it at right An|gles. The River went parallel to it on the South.</P>
<P>About Two Miles from <HI>Farnham,</HI> is <HI>More-park,</HI> formerly the Seat of Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI> who, by his Will, ordered his Heart to be put into a China-ba&s;on, and buried under a Sun-dial in his Garden, which was accordingly perform'd. This Hou&s;e is
<PB N="209" REF="216">
&s;ituated in a Valley, &s;urrounded on every Side with Hills, having a running Stream thro' the Gardens, which, with a &s;mall Expence, might be made to &s;erpent thro' all the adjoining Meadows, in a mo&s;t delightful manner. At about a Quarter of a Mile from the Hou&s;e, is a large Grotto in the Side of a Hill, from whence you may command a Pro&s;pect of the Meadows and Woods which lie below it; and the&s;e are bounded again by Hills, which makes the whole one of the mo&s;t romantick Places imagin|able.</P>
<P>From <HI>Farnham,</HI> that I might take in the whole County of <HI>Surrey,</HI> I took the Coach Road over <HI>Bag&s;hot-heath,</HI> and that great Fore&s;t, as it is call'd, of <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bag&s;hot-heath,</HI> which at pre&s;ent is a horrid bar|ren Country, is capable of great Improvement, as may be judg'd by the &s;everal Inclo&s;ures on the Bor|ders of it, and &s;ome in the Centre al&s;o, which from being in the &s;ame Condition, (as we at pre&s;ent &s;ee the whole Face of the Country thereabouts, very barren, producing nothing but Heath and Whorts) now produces good Corn and Gra&s;s, and in &s;ome Parts are good Plantations of Trees, which thrive well. On the Edge of this Heath are &s;everal Seats of Noblemen; but tho&s;e which require Notice are, fir&s;t, the Right Hon. the Earl of <HI>Arran</HI>'s, which is a large Inclo&s;ure, the Wood-walks and other Plan|tations being upward of Two Miles in Circum|ference; and the Park, which runs on the other Side of the Hou&s;e, is upward of Three Miles. The Plantations in this Inclo&s;ure have made good Pro|gre&s;s, which is a Proof, that the Soil thereabout is capable of great Improvement.</P>
<P>The next Seat is that of the Right Hon. the Earl of <HI>Angle&s;ea,</HI> which is an antient Hou&s;e, &s;ituated very near the Church, and almo&s;t &s;urrounded with large Trees, &s;o that only the Front appears to View.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="217">The Duke of <HI>Roxborough</HI> has al&s;o a Seat in this Place, where his Grace u&s;ed to re&s;ide a great Part of the Summer and Autumn, for the Plea&s;ure of Shooting, being very fond of that Sport.</P>
<P>This De&s;ert lies extended &s;o much, that &s;ome &s;ay there is not le&s;s than 100,000 Acres of this barren Land that lies all together, reaching out every Way in the Three Counties of <HI>Surrey, Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Berk&s;hire</HI>; be&s;ides a great Quantity of Land, almo&s;t as bad as that between <HI>Godalmin</HI> and <HI>Petersfield,</HI> on the Road to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> including &s;ome Hills call'd the <HI>Hind-head,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to take notice of a common Mi&s;take in relation to <HI>Bag&s;hot</HI> Mutton, &s;o much valued by the Gentry, which they &s;uppo&s;e to be fed there, and from the Poorne&s;s of the Soil, render'd &s;maller than mo&s;t other Mutton in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> whereas I am credibly inform'd, that none of the Sheep are fed at <HI>Bag&s;hot,</HI> being brought from and fed upon <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> Downs, and all kill'd by the Butchers of <HI>Bag&s;hot,</HI> and &s;ent to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Thro' this De&s;ert, for I can call it no le&s;s, we come into the great We&s;tern Road, leading from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Sali&s;bury, Exeter,</HI> &amp;c. and pa&s;s the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Stanes.</HI></P>
<P>The Bridge of <HI>Stanes,</HI> and <HI>Egham</HI> Cau&s;eway, which are part of the Highway from <HI>London,</HI> to the We&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> having been, for &s;ome time, in a ruinous and dangerous Condition, and the Tolls and Duties laid by an Act pa&s;&s;ed in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and another in that of Queen <HI>Eliza|beth,</HI> amounting to no more than the clear Sum of 45<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> the Bridgema&s;ters were obliged to exact at the Ferry there exorbitant Rates for con|veying Pa&s;&s;engers over the <HI>Thames,</HI> in order the bet|ter to &s;upport the &s;aid Bridge and Cau&s;eway; and yet all proving in&s;ufficient, as well as burden&s;ome, an Act pa&s;&s;ed in the Se&s;&s;ion of 1739-40, for the more
<PB N="211" REF="218">
effectual Maintenance and well-keeping of them both; and will be a great Benefit to Pa&s;&s;engers, as al&s;o to the River, and the Towns adjacent; and the Act provides, that in ca&s;e of the Reparation of the Bridge, or any other Accident which &s;hall hinder Pa&s;&s;engers or Carriages going over the Bridge, the Ferry &s;hall exact no higher Rate for conveying over &s;uch Pa&s;&s;engers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than are laid for pa&s;&s;ing over the Bridge.</P>
<P>Here recollecting that I had yet left the Inland Towns of the Two Counties of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and great Part of the County of <HI>Surrey,</HI> out of my Ac|count; and that having, as it were, taken a Circuit round the Coa&s;t only, I had a great many Places worth viewing to give an Account of; I therefore left <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> on one Side of the River, and <HI>Hamp|ton-Court</HI> on the other, to be the Subject of another Letter; and re&s;olv'd to fini&s;h my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e in the Order I had begun it, that is to &s;ay, to take in the whole Country as I came on; that I might make as few Tran&s;itions as po&s;&s;ible from one remote Part of <HI>England</HI> to another.</P>
<P>From <HI>Stanes</HI> therefore I turn'd S. and S. E. to <HI>Chert&s;ey,</HI> another Market-town, and where there is a Bridge over the <HI>Thames:</HI> this Town is noted for the Burial-place of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. whence his Bones were afterwards removed to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> VII. and al&s;o by its being the Retreat of the incomparable <HI>Cowley,</HI> where he lived di&s;tant from the Hurries of the Court and Town, intirely taken up in Country Bu&s;ine&s;s, Farming and Hu&s;bandry, for his Diver|&s;ion, and where he al&s;o dy'd.</P>
<P>From this Town, wholly employ'd in Malting, and in Barge Carriages down the River to <HI>London,</HI> I went away South to <HI>Working,</HI> a private Country Market-town, &s;o out of the Way, that 'tis very little heard of in <HI>England.</HI> It claims however &s;ome Honour, from its being once the Re&s;idence of a
<PB N="212" REF="219">
Royal Branch of the Family of <HI>Plantagenet,</HI> the old Counte&s;s of <HI>Richmond,</HI> Mother to King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. who made her la&s;t Retreat here, where the King her Son built, or rather repair'd, an old Royal Hou&s;e, on purpo&s;e for her Re&s;idence, and where &s;he ended her Days in Honour and Peace; the former Part of her Life having been much expo&s;ed to Storms and Dangers under the turbulent Reigns of the Two preceding Monarchs.</P>
<P>From hence we came to <HI>Guilford,</HI> a well known and con&s;iderable Market-town. Here &s;ometimes the A&s;&s;izes are held, but always Elections for Par|liament Men for the County. The River, which, according to Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> is called the <HI>Wey,</HI> and which falls into the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Oatlands,</HI> is made navigable to this Town, which adds greatly to its Trade; and by this Navigation a very great Quan|tity of Timber is brought down to <HI>London,</HI> not from the Neighbourhood of this Town only, but even from the woody Parts of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> above Thirty Miles from it, the Country Carriages bring|ing it hither in the Summer by Land. This Navi|gation is al&s;o a great Support to the Corn-market at <HI>Farnham:</HI> for as the Meal-men, and other Deal|ers, buy the Corn at that Market, a good deal of it is brought to the Mills on this River; which is not above Seven Miles di&s;tant, and being fir&s;t ground and dre&s;s'd, is then &s;ent down in the Meal by Barges to <HI>London,</HI> at a &s;mall Expence.</P>
<P>Here is a &s;mall Remainder of an old Manufacture, in the Clothing-trade; and it extends it&s;elf to <HI>Godalmin, Ha&s;elmere,</HI> and the Vale Country, on the Side of the <HI>Holmwood,</HI> (of which I &s;hall &s;peak on another Occa&s;ion) quite to <HI>Darking.</HI> The&s;e Cloths of a middling Price have formerly been in great Re|pute, but afterwards lo&s;t their Credit for &s;ome time, till, by the Application and Skill of the Clothiers, of late they revived, whil&s;t the Clothiers of <HI>Cran|brook</HI>
<PB N="213" REF="220">
and <HI>Tenterden</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> who&s;e Goods are of the &s;ame Kind, are almo&s;t &s;unk to nothing, as I have already ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>This Clothing-trade, however &s;mall, is yet very a&s;&s;i&s;ting to the Poor of this Part of the Country, where the Lands, as I have noted, are but indifferent, the Inhabitants generally Cottagers, living chiefly by the Commons and Heath Ground thereabouts.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 23d of <HI>April</HI> 1740, the Upper Church at <HI>Guilford</HI> in <HI>Surrey</HI> fell down. It was an antient Building, and, not long before, 750<HI>l.</HI> was expended upon it in Repairs; there was Preaching in it on the <HI>Sunday</HI> before, and Workmen were employ'd in taking down the Bells, who providentially had quitted the Spot about a Quarter of an Hour before the Accident happened, &s;o that not one Per&s;on re|ceived any Hurt, tho' great Numbers were Spectators: Three Bells had been taken down, and the other Three fell with the Steeple, which broke the Body of the Church to Pieces, tho' the Steeple received but little Damage by the Fall.</P>
<P>From <HI>Guilford</HI> the Road to <HI>Farnham</HI> is very re|markable; for it runs along We&s;t from <HI>Guilford,</HI> upon the Ridge of a high chalky Hill, no wider than the Road it&s;elf, and the Declivity begins on either hand, at the very Hedge that bounds the Highway, and is very &s;teep and high. From this Hill is a Pro&s;pect either way, &s;o far, that 'tis &s;ur|pri&s;ing; in&s;omuch that one &s;ees to the North, or North-we&s;t, over <HI>Bag&s;hot-heath,</HI> one way, to the South-ea&s;t into <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> the other way, almo&s;t to the <HI>South-downs,</HI> and We&s;t to an unbounded Length, where the Horizon only re&s;trains the Eye. This Hill being all Chalk, a Traveller feels the Effect of it in a hot Summer's Day, when the Reflection of the Sun make the Heat almo&s;t in&s;upportable. This Hill reaches from <HI>Guilford</HI> &s;o far as within a Mile and a half of <HI>Farnham.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="221">The Hill, or rather the A&s;cent of it from <HI>Guil|ford,</HI> is called <HI>St. Catharine's-hill</HI>; on the Summit whereof &s;tands the Gallows, which is &s;o placed, that the Towns-people, from the <HI>High-&s;treet,</HI> may &s;it at their Shop-doors, and &s;ee the Criminals executed.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Guilford,</HI> on the Left-hand Side of the Road leading to <HI>Godalmin,</HI> are the Remains of an antient Chapel, &s;ituated on the Summit of a Hill, &s;o as to be &s;een at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance every way. This is called <HI>St. Catharine's</HI> Chapel. The Mate|rials with which this was built, are a &s;ort of Tile, which when broken, has the Appearance of Iron within; and the Cement which joins the&s;e Titles, is now &s;o hard, as &s;carcely to be penetrated with the &s;tronge&s;t In&s;trument. The only Remains of this Chapel, are the out&s;ide Walls, which being built with the&s;e Materials, have re&s;i&s;ted the Weather, and the common Fate of Things.</P>
<P>The great Road from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> and from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> lying thro' <HI>Guilford,</HI> it is con&s;equently a Town very well furni&s;hed with Inns for Accommodation of Travellers, as is <HI>God|almin</HI> al&s;o, the next Town, within Three Miles of it, noted likewi&s;e, of late Years, for the Place of Re&s;idence of the Impo&s;tor <HI>Mary Tofts,</HI> who &s;o long amu&s;ed State&s;men, Phy&s;icians, Anatomi&s;ts, and, in &s;hort, all Degrees of Men, learned and un|learned, with her infamous Rabbet-productions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Guilford</HI> lies a Cro&s;s-road, as it may be called, to <HI>London,</HI> not frequented by Coaches or Carriers, or the ordinary Pa&s;&s;engers to <HI>London,</HI> tho' 'tis by &s;ome reckoned the neare&s;t Way, and is with|out Que&s;tion much the plea&s;anter Road, if not the plea&s;ante&s;t in this Part of <HI>England; viz.</HI> From this Town to <HI>Leatherhead,</HI> 10 Miles; from <HI>Leather|head</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> over <HI>Ban&s;tead-downs,</HI> 15 Miles; or, if you plea&s;e, by <HI>Ep&s;om,</HI> 17 Miles; which, tho'
<PB N="215" REF="222">
it is called the farthe&s;t Way, makes Amends abun|dantly by the Advantage and Plea&s;antne&s;s of the Road.</P>
<P>In the Road from <HI>Guilford</HI> to <HI>Ep&s;om,</HI> being 15 Miles, you meet with a Town almo&s;t at every Two Miles End, in or near which is a hand&s;ome Seat. The Road is always good, being a very hard Gravel. On the Right-hand of the Road lie the <HI>Downs,</HI> which have con&s;tantly a great Number of Sheep feeding on them; and on the Left, the Parks, Gardens, and cultivated Fields, belonging to the &s;everal Gentlemen who inhabit tho&s;e Seats; all which render the Road very plea&s;ant and agreeable.</P>
<P>The Seat of the Lord <HI>On&s;low,</HI> which is the fir&s;t on the Road from <HI>Guilford,</HI> is but indifferently &s;ituated; the Front which faces the Road, is ob|&s;cured by the Wood, &s;o that it can be &s;een only in one Point of View; and the Hou&s;e &s;tanding very low, does not command any Pro&s;pect from the neighbouring <HI>Downs:</HI> the Avenues to it are very narrow, and the Building, tho' very large, is exe|cuted in a very bad Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame Road lies an antient Seat, now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>James Fox,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> which tho' an old Building, yet having an open Situation, in Front, toward the <HI>Downs,</HI> is rendered very plea&s;ant; and the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, being a Per&s;on of fine Ta&s;te, is beautifying the Hou&s;e within, and making plea&s;ant Plantations about it; which will be a great Embelli&s;h|ment to the Seat.</P>
<P>Near this Road al&s;o lies the Seat of the Honourable Sir <HI>Conyers Darcy</HI>; which is &s;ituated on an Emi|nence, &s;o as to be &s;een many Miles di&s;tant. The Hou&s;e is a large new Edifice, having a Park behind it, and is pretty well timbered on every Side. I ought not to omit mentioning the Seat of the late <HI>Arthur Moore,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> at <HI>Fetcham,</HI> near <HI>Leatherhead,</HI> now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Thomas Revel,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> where no
<PB N="216" REF="223">
Co&s;t has been &s;pared to make a mo&s;t beautiful Situ|ation by Nature more delightful by Art.</P>
<P>Two Miles from <HI>Guilford,</HI> on the Banks of the <HI>Wey,</HI> is a fine Seat, which belonged, when I &s;aw it, to the late <HI>Denzil On&s;low,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> called <HI>Pyrford,</HI> and is exceeding plea&s;ant, e&s;pecially for the beautiful Intermixture of Wood and Water in the Park, Gardens, and Grounds adjoining; whereby that Gentleman, who&s;e Genius lay wonderfully in im|proving Lands, and rendering Things more profitable and plea&s;ant, brought <HI>Pyrford</HI> to &s;uch a Perfection, as to be inferior to very few, if any, of the fine&s;t Hou&s;es in <HI>Surrey.</HI> Adjoining to the Park is a very convenient and ingenious Decoy, the fir&s;t of the Kind in this Part of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>At the North-ea&s;t End of this Range of fine Seats, is <HI>Leatherhead,</HI> a little Thoroughfare-town, with a Stone Bridge over the <HI>Mole,</HI> a River &s;o called, from its remarkable Sinking into the Earth, at the Foot of <HI>Box-hill,</HI> near a Village called <HI>Mickleham,</HI> and working its Way under Ground like a Mole, ri&s;ing again at or near this Town of <HI>Leatherhead</HI>; where its wandering Streams are united again, and form a pretty large River, as they were before, running to|gether under <HI>Leatherhead</HI> Bridge, and from thence to <HI>Cobham,</HI> and &s;o it pur&s;ues its Cour&s;e to the <HI>Thames,</HI> which it joins at <HI>Mole&s;ey,</HI> which doubtle&s;s takes its Name from the River.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but take Notice of an unac|countable Error, into which all the Writers I have met with have unwarily fallen, on account of this little River hiding it&s;elf in the Earth, and finding its Way under Ground, from the Foot of <HI>Beechworth,</HI> or <HI>Bet&s;worth-ca&s;tle,</HI> near <HI>Box-hill,</HI> and then ri&s;ing again at <HI>Leatherhead,</HI> as above; as if the Water had at once ingulph'd it&s;elf in a Cha&s;m of Earth, or &s;unk in a Whirlpit. The great <HI>Camden</HI> has not a little contributed to this Error in his Account thereof;
<PB N="217" REF="224">
but as he is in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;et right by an Ob&s;er|vation and Note in the la&s;t Edition of his <HI>Britannia,</HI> by the Right Rev. Continuator, I &s;hall have the le&s;s Occa&s;ion to in&s;i&s;t upon the Matter; and &s;hall there|fore refer to them, and only mention what I have my&s;elf ob&s;erved on this Occa&s;ion, having re&s;ided &s;ome time in the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The Current of the River being much ob&s;tructed by the Interpo&s;ition of <HI>Box-hill,</HI> which, interrupt|ing its free Cour&s;e, forces the Waters to find their Way thro' as well as they can; and in order to this, coming near that Part called the <HI>Stomacher,</HI> the Waters &s;ink in&s;en&s;ibly away, le&s;&s;ening the Stream for near Two Miles, and the&s;e Chanels they call the <HI>Swallows</HI>; and the whole Ground on the Bank of the River, where it is flat and low, is full of the&s;e &s;ubterraneous Pa&s;&s;ages; &s;o that if on any &s;udden Rain the River &s;wells over the Banks, it is ob&s;erved not to go back into the Chanel again when the Flood abates, but to &s;ink away into the Earth in the Mea|dows, where it &s;preads.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Swallows,</HI> for there are many, and not one called the <HI>Swallow,</HI> as is &s;aid in Mr. <HI>Camden</HI>; tho' they dimini&s;h the Stream much, do not &s;o drink it up, as to make it di&s;appear: but when it cro&s;&s;es the Roof near <HI>Mickleham,</HI> it runs very &s;harp and broad, nor did I ever know it without Water in the drie&s;t Summer in that Place. On the contrary, I have known it &s;o deep, the Waggons and Carriages have not dared to go thro'.</P>
<P>Below this Place the Hills ri&s;e again on the other Side very high, and particularly on the Ridge, which the Country People call the <HI>A&s;hcomb-hills,</HI> and they &s;eem to force the River again We&s;t; &s;o it &s;urrounds mo&s;t of the Park formerly belonging to Sir <HI>Richard Studdolph,</HI> and has &s;everal Bridges upon it; and by this time indeed, &s;o much of it is &s;unk away, that &s;ometimes the Chanel, tho' full of Water in Pits and Holes,
<PB N="218" REF="225">
cannot be perceived to run; but this mu&s;t be in a very dry Sea&s;on, and &s;till the Chanel is vi&s;ible, where it runs at other times rapidly enough.</P>
<P>This Part, which has the lea&s;t Water, continuing about half a Mile, we then perceive the Stream very vi&s;ibly to be increa&s;ed; &s;o that it takes Vent again, now, in thou&s;ands of little Springs, till, in another half Mile, it is an ample River again, and pa&s;&s;es in full Streams under <HI>Leatherhead</HI> Bridge, as above.</P>
<P>A further Proof of the gradual &s;inking away of the Water, take as follows: In <HI>October</HI> 1676, there happened a very &s;udden ha&s;ty Land-flood, which &s;welled the River to a very great Height; and parti|cularly &s;o high, that at <HI>Beechworth-ca&s;tle,</HI> and at other Gentlemens Seats, near the River, where they had Fi&s;h-ponds that were fed by the River, it over|flowed their Ponds, and carried off all their Fi&s;h. Sir <HI>Adam Brown</HI> lived then at <HI>Beechworth-ca&s;tle</HI>; and his Son, and the young Gentlemen of the neighbour|ing Families, di&s;turbed at the Lo&s;s of their Fi&s;h, came all down to <HI>Darking</HI>; where they rai&s;ed a little Troop of the young Fellows and Boys of the Town, and all went together, to that Part of the River which runs by the Foot of the <HI>Stomacher</HI> of <HI>Box-hill.</HI></P>
<P>There was a low flat Piece of Meadow-ground, lying clo&s;e to the River on one Side; ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to which, the Hill, lying al&s;o clo&s;e to the River, made up the Bank on the other: this Piece of Ground might contain about Four or Five Acres, and lying hollow in the Middle, like the Shape of a Dripping|pan, was by the Overflowing of the River &s;o full of Water, that the Bank, which lay clo&s;e to the River, tho' higher than the re&s;t, was not to be &s;een.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen &s;et them&s;elves to rai&s;e this Bank, &s;o as to &s;eparate the Water in the hollow Part of the Field, from that in the River, and then made a Re|turn to it, at the Upper, or Ea&s;t-end of the Field; &s;o that no more Water could run into the Field from
<PB N="219" REF="226">
any Part of the River. And the Event was, that in about Two Nights and a Day, exclu&s;ive of the Time they took in making their Dams, the Water &s;unk all away in the Field; and the Fi&s;h being &s;ur|rounded, were caught, as it were, in a Trap; and the Purchace fully recompen&s;ed their Labour; for the like Quantity of Fi&s;h, great and &s;mall, I believe, was never taken at once in this Kingdom, out of &s;o &s;mall a River.</P>
<P>This Story I mention, as a Demon&s;tration of the Manner of this River lo&s;ing it&s;elf under Ground, or being <HI>&s;wallowed up,</HI> as they call it; for this Field, where the Water &s;unk away is ju&s;t at the Place, which Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls <HI>Swallow,</HI> near the Village of <HI>Mickleham,</HI> and under the Precipice of the Hill; and yet the Water was Two Nights and a Day &s;ink|ing lei&s;urely off. And in this manner, and no other, does &s;o much of the River as pa&s;&s;es under Ground, &s;ink away.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Darking</HI> is eminent for &s;everal little Things worth Ob&s;ervation; as, fir&s;t, for the great <HI>Roman</HI> Highway, called <HI>Stoney-&s;treet,</HI> which pa&s;&s;es thro' the Church-yard of this Town: Secondly, for a little Common or Heath, called the <HI>Cottman Dean,</HI> or the Heath of <HI>Poor Cottages,</HI> (for &s;o the Word &s;ignifies) belonging to the Town; and where their Alms-hou&s;e &s;tands, which &s;ome learned Phy&s;icians believe to be the be&s;t Air in <HI>England:</HI> Thirdly, for Mr. <HI>Howard</HI>'s Hou&s;e and Garden, called <HI>Deepden</HI>; which &s;tand in a &s;mall Valley, environed with &s;teep Hills on every Side; the Level-ground about the Hou&s;e was laid out into plea&s;ant Walks and Gardens, which were planted with a great Variety of Exotick Trees and Plants, and the Hills were planted with Trees on every Side (excepting the South A&s;pect) which was planted with Vines; and formerly there has been &s;ome tolerable good Wine made there, tho' the Hill is &s;o &s;teep, that it is very difficult to walk up
<PB N="220" REF="227">
it. At pre&s;ent the Gardens and Vineyard are neg|lected, and many of the Exotick Trees have been de&s;troy'd. On the Summit of the Hill, above the Vineyard, is a Summer-hou&s;e, from which, in a clear Day, you may di&s;cern the Sea over the <HI>South-downs,</HI> near <HI>Arundel.</HI></P>
<P>The Market of <HI>Darking</HI> is the mo&s;t famous in <HI>England,</HI> for Poultry; and particularly for the fatte&s;t Gee&s;e, and the large&s;t Capons. They are brought hither from as far as <HI>Hor&s;ham</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI>; and 'tis the Bu&s;ine&s;s of all the Country, on that Side, for many Miles, to breed and fatten them up; and &s;ome are &s;o large, as to be little inferior to Turkeys; I have &s;een them &s;old for 4<HI>s.</HI> to 4<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> each, and weighing from 4 to 5 or 6 lb. a-piece.</P>
<P>On <HI>Holy Thur&s;day,</HI> here is al&s;o a Fair, chiefly for Lambs, and the greate&s;t in <HI>England</HI> of that Kind: I have pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;o much celebrated Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Evelyn</HI> at <HI>Wotton,</HI> near <HI>Darking,</HI> not that it is not worth Notice; but becau&s;e &s;o many others have &s;aid &s;o much of it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Box-hill,</HI> and particularly from this Part of it, is a fair View, in clear Weather, quite over the <HI>Weald</HI> of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> to the <HI>South-downs</HI>; and by the Help of Gla&s;&s;es, the Town of <HI>Hor&s;ham, A&s;hdown</HI> Fore&s;t, the Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI>'s Hou&s;e at <HI>Petworth,</HI> and the <HI>South-downs,</HI> as they range between <HI>Bright|helm&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Arundel,</HI> may be plainly &s;een; be&s;ides an unbounded Pro&s;pect into <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>The Vale beneath this Hill is, for many Miles Ea&s;t and We&s;t, called the <HI>Holmward,</HI> or <HI>Holm&s;dale</HI>; in the woody Part of which are often found Out-lying Red Deer; and in the Days of King <HI>James</HI> II. or while he was Duke of <HI>York,</HI> they have hunted the large&s;t Stags here that have been &s;een in <HI>England.</HI> The Duke took great Care to have them pre&s;erved for his own Sport; but they have, &s;ince that, been mo&s;t of them de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="228">This <HI>Holmward</HI> is now chiefly overgrown with Furz; but was famous for producing &s;uch Quantities of Strawberries, that they were carried to Market by Hor&s;e-loads.</P>
<P>It is &s;ugge&s;ted, that this Place was in antient Times the Retreat for many Ages of the native <HI>Britons,</HI> whom the <HI>Romans</HI> could never drive out; and, after that, it was the like to the <HI>Saxons,</HI> when the <HI>Danes</HI> hara&s;&s;ed the Nation, and ravaged the Country where-ever they came. On this Account they retain here in Memory the following Lines:
<Q><L><HI>This is</HI> Holme&s;dale,</L>
<L><HI>Never conquer'd, never &s;hall.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The Country, tho' wild &s;till, and perhaps having the &s;ame Countenance now in many Places, as it had a thou&s;and Years ago; yet in other Places is culti|vated, and has Roads pa&s;&s;able enough in the Summer quite thro' it, on every Side, and the Woods are in a great mea&s;ure cleared off.</P>
<P>Keeping along the Bottom of the&s;e Hills, and yet not entering into this Vale, the Country is dry, &s;andy or gravelly, and full of Gentlemens Hou&s;es, and good Towns; tho' if we go but a little to the Right-hand South, into the wild Part, 'tis a deep, &s;trong, and, in the wet Sea&s;on, an unpa&s;&s;able Clay.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing thro' <HI>Holme&s;dale</HI> (upon the Ridge of Mountains which extend from <HI>Kent</HI> to the <HI>Land's-end</HI>) you come to <HI>Wotton,</HI> a &s;mall Village, near which is the antient Seat of the <HI>Evelyns,</HI> which is &s;ituated among&s;t Meadows, having plea&s;ant Streams of Wa|ter pa&s;&s;ing thro' them, and the neighbouring Hills covered with Woods, which renders the Situation plea&s;ant in the Summer-&s;ea&s;on; but the Roads about it being very bad in Winter, it is not &s;o convenient an Habitation at that Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>Near this Place is &s;ituated <HI>Lith-hill,</HI> which ri&s;es gradually from hence, for near Three Miles to the
<PB N="222" REF="229">
South; from the Top of which you have a full Pro&s;pect of the whole Counties of <HI>Surrey</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> Part of <HI>Hamp&s;hire, Berk&s;hire, Oxford&s;hire, Bucking|ham&s;hire, Hertford&s;hire, Middle&s;ex, Kent,</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>; the whole Extent of this Pro&s;pect being thought near 200 Miles, and that without the Help of Gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Travelling Ea&s;t at the Foot of the Hills, we came to <HI>Rygate,</HI> a large Market-town, &s;ituated in the Valley of <HI>Holme&s;dale</HI>; where are &s;till to be &s;een the Ruins of a Ca&s;tle, with a long Vault, and a Room at the End of it; in which 'tis &s;aid the Barons who were in Arms again&s;t King <HI>John,</HI> held their private Meetings.</P>
<P>Near this al&s;o are two mi&s;erable Borough Towns, which neverthele&s;s &s;end each of them Two Members to Parliament, to wit, <HI>Gatton</HI> under the Side of the Hill, almo&s;t at <HI>Rygate</HI>; and <HI>Bleechingly</HI> more Ea&s;t|ward.</P>
<P>At <HI>Nutfield,</HI> between <HI>Rygate</HI> and <HI>Beechingly,</HI> is another Branch of the Family of <HI>Evelyn,</HI> who have flouri&s;hed there many Years.</P>
<P>From hence, cro&s;&s;ing &s;till all the Roads leading from <HI>London</HI> into <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> we came again to a Village called <HI>God&s;tone,</HI> which lies on the Road from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Lewes.</HI></P>
<P>And keeping on Ea&s;t, we came to <HI>We&s;terham,</HI> a neat, hand&s;ome, well-built Market-town, the fir&s;t in <HI>Kent</HI> on that Side. The late Earl of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> built (or rather fini&s;hed, for it was begun by a private Gentleman) a very noble Hou&s;e here, called <HI>Squirries,</HI> which is now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>John Warde,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Son to Sir <HI>John Warde,</HI> who was Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> in the Year 1724. The Hou&s;e &s;tands on a &s;mall Eminence, regarding the Land in the Front; but on the Back of the Hou&s;e, the Ground ri&s;es very high, and is divided into &s;everal &s;teep Slopes, which renders the Situation
<PB N="223" REF="230">
damp and cold. Near the Hou&s;e are &s;ome Woods, thro' which the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has cut &s;everal Ridings; and on the other Side of the Hill, behind the Hou&s;e, ari&s;e Nine con&s;iderable Springs, which unite at a &s;mall Di&s;tance; and the&s;e form the River <HI>Dart,</HI> which runs thro' <HI>Dartford,</HI> and afterwards di&s;charges it&s;elf into the <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>All this Part of the Country, from <HI>Guilford</HI> to this Place, is very agreeably plea&s;ant, healthy, and fruitful; and is over&s;pread with good Towns, Gentlemens Hou&s;es, populous Villages, abundance of Fruit, with Hop-grounds and Cherry-orchards, and the Lands well cultivated; but all on the Right-hand, that is to &s;ay, South, is over-grown with Timber, has abundance of wa&s;te and wild Grounds, and Fore&s;ts, and Woods, with many large Iron-works, at which they ca&s;t Iron-caldrons, Chimney-backs, Furnaces, Retorts, Boiling-pots, Iron Cannon, Bomb-&s;hells, Stink-pots, Hand-gre|nadoes, Cannon-ball, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From hence going forward Ea&s;t, we come to <HI>Riverhead,</HI> a Town on the Road from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Tunbridge</HI>; and then having little to &s;peak of in <HI>Kent,</HI> except &s;ome petty Market-towns, &s;uch as <HI>Wrotham,</HI> commonly called <HI>Rootham, Town-Malling, Cranbrook,</HI> and the like, of which I have taken &s;ome Notice before; I turned North, and came to <HI>Bromley,</HI> a Market-town, made famous by an Ho&s;pital, or College, built there by Dr. <HI>John Warner,</HI> Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> for the Relief of 20 poor Widows of loyal and orthodox Clergy|men, who are allowed each 20<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and a Chaplain 50<HI>l.</HI> and has had many Gifts and Charities be&s;towed on it &s;ince.</P>
<P>Near this Town we turned away by <HI>Beckenham,</HI> and thro' <HI>Norwood</HI> to <HI>Croyden</HI>; in the Way we &s;aw <HI>Dulwich</HI> or <HI>Sydenham-wells,</HI> where great Crouds of the lower Cla&s;s of People throng every Summer from
<PB N="224" REF="231">
<HI>London,</HI> to drink the Waters there and at <HI>Stretham</HI>; and the rather, becau&s;e it lies &s;o near <HI>London,</HI> that they can walk to it in the Morning, and return at Night.</P>
<P><HI>Croydon</HI> has a great Corn-market, but chiefly for Oats and Oatmeal for the Service of <HI>London.</HI> The Town is large, and full of Citizens from <HI>London:</HI> in it is the antient Palace of the Archbi&s;hops of <HI>Can|terbury,</HI> and &s;everal of them lie buried in the Church here; particularly Archbi&s;hop <HI>Whitgift,</HI> who not only repaired the Palace, but built and endowed the famous Ho&s;pital, (which is for a Warden and 28 Men and Women) and the Free-&s;chool.</P>
<P>From hence we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Beddington,</HI> where is the Seat or Man&s;ion-hou&s;e of the antient Family of the <HI>Carews.</HI> The Hou&s;e is noble, and the Gardens fine; yet Architects &s;ay, that the two Wings are too deep for the Body of the Hou&s;e; that they &s;hould either have been more a&s;under, or not &s;o long. The Court before them is extremely fine, as is the Canal in the Park, before the Court, having a River running thro' it; the Gardens take up all the flat Part of the Park, with Vi&s;ta's, or Pro&s;pects, for Two or Three Miles. The Orange-trees con|tinue, and are the only ones in <HI>England</HI> that grow in the natural Ground: they have moving Hou&s;es to &s;helter them in the Winter from the Inclemencies of our Climate, and are loaded with Fruit in the Summer. They have &s;tood in the Ground where they now grow, above 100 Years.</P>
<P>From hence it is but a little Mile to <HI>Ca&s;halton,</HI> a Country Village &s;ituate among innumerable Springs of Water, which, all together, form a River in the very Street of the Town, and joining the other Springs, which come from <HI>Croydon</HI> and <HI>Beddington,</HI> make one Stream, called the <HI>Wandell.</HI> This Village, tho' lying among &s;uch delightful Springs, is yet upon firm Chalk; and having the <HI>Downs</HI> adjoining, makes
<PB N="225" REF="232">
the mo&s;t agreeable Spot on this Side of <HI>London,</HI> as is abundantly te&s;tify'd by its being crouded, as it were, with fine Hou&s;es of the Citizens of <HI>London</HI>; &s;ome of which are built with &s;uch a Profu&s;ion of Expence, that they look rather like Seats of the Nobility, than the Country-hou&s;es of Citizens and Merchants. Mr. <HI>Scawen,</HI> Knight of the Shire for this County, de&s;ign'd a noble Hou&s;e here; but it is not proceeded with. That which once belonged to Sir <HI>John Fel|lows,</HI> Sub-governor of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company in the fatal Year 1720, was built by Dr. <HI>Ratcliff</HI>; but the Gardens were made by Sir <HI>John.</HI> It was purcha&s;ed by the Right Honourable <HI>Philip</HI> Lord <HI>Hardwick,</HI> Lord High Chancellor of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> by whom it was lately &s;old to <HI>William Mitchel</HI> of <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> who now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it. I cannot dwell on the De&s;cription of all the fine Hou&s;es in this and the neighbouring Villages: I &s;hall &s;peak of them again in bulk with their Neighbours of <HI>Mitcham, Stretham, Tooting, Clapham,</HI> and others; but I mu&s;t take a Trip here cro&s;s the <HI>Downs</HI> to <HI>Ep&s;om.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ban&s;tead-downs</HI> need no De&s;cription other than this, that being &s;o near <HI>London,</HI> and &s;urrounded as they are with plea&s;ant Villages, the Ground &s;mooth, &s;oft, level and dry, (even in but a few Hours after Rain) they con&s;pire to make the mo&s;t de|lightful Spot of Ground of that Kind, in all this Part of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>About four Miles over tho&s;e delicious <HI>Downs</HI> bring us to <HI>Ep&s;om,</HI> a well-built, large, and hand|&s;ome Village, which abounds with fine Hou&s;es, the Retreats principally of the <HI>London</HI> Merchants. It was very much frequented a few Years ago, on account of its Mineral Waters, which i&s;&s;ue from a ri&s;ing Ground nearer <HI>A&s;hted</HI> than <HI>Ep&s;om:</HI> but they are now, tho' not impaired in their Virtues, yet pretty much &s;o in their Reputation; po&s;&s;ibly owing, more than any thing el&s;e, to the Place being too near
<PB N="226" REF="233">
<HI>London</HI> for a Journey for the Quality and Gentry; according to the old Saying, <HI>Far-fetch'd and dear|bought is fitte&s;t for the Ladies.</HI> The Hall, Galleries, and other publick Apartments, are run to Decay; and there remains but one Hou&s;e on the Spot, which is inhabited by a Countryman and his Wife, who carry the Waters in Bottles to the adjacent Places.</P>
<P>There are a great many fine Seats around this Place, which we have not Room to de&s;cribe: &s;uch as the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI>'s, Lady <HI>Fielding</HI>'s, Mr. <HI>Mitchell</HI>'s at <HI>Ca&s;halton,</HI> ju&s;t mention'd, Mr. <HI>Scawen</HI>'s, and many others; particularly that formerly called <HI>Non&s;uch,</HI> which was once a Royal Palace, and finely &s;ituated. King <HI>Charles</HI> II. gave it to the Duche&s;s of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> and &s;he &s;old it to my Lord <HI>Berkeley,</HI> who built a fine Seat with the Materials of it, near <HI>Ep&s;om,</HI> called <HI>Durdans. Non&s;uch</HI> is now but a Farm-hou&s;e, and <HI>Durdans</HI> is in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lord <HI>North</HI> and <HI>Guilford</HI>; but his Royal Highne&s;s <HI>Frederick</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> has lately taken it for a plea&s;urable Retreat, when he is not di&s;po&s;ed to go &s;o far as <HI>Cliefden</HI> in <HI>Bucks.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Ep&s;om,</HI> that I might thoroughly vi&s;it the County of <HI>Surrey,</HI> I rode over &s;tiff Clays, and thro' very bad Roads, to <HI>King&s;ton</HI>; from whence I had a fine View of <HI>Hampton-court,</HI> at a Di&s;tance; but that I re&s;erve for another Journey.</P>
<P><HI>King&s;ton</HI> is a good Market-town, remarkable for a Free-&s;chool, erected and endowed by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; an Alms-hou&s;e built in 1670 by Alder|man <HI>Cleaver</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and endowed with Lands of 80<HI>l.</HI> a Year, a Hou&s;e were formerly re&s;ided the great Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> &s;urnamed <HI>Make-king,</HI> be|&s;ides <HI>Coomb,</HI> which was likewi&s;e his, but now in the Family of the <HI>Harveys</HI>; from whence the Wa|ters of certain Springs are &s;aid to be conveyed in leaden Pipes under the Road, and the <HI>Thames,</HI> to <HI>Hampton-court,</HI> Three Miles in Length. Several of
<PB N="227" REF="234">
the old <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings were not only crowned, but had their actual Re&s;idence here; whence it took its Name of <HI>King&s;town.</HI> It had once the Privilege of &s;ending Burge&s;&s;es to Parliament, but now that is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>From hence turning Southward, on the Road to <HI>Guilford,</HI> we come to <HI>E&s;her,</HI> where was formerly a Seat built by Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> to which, during his Mini&s;try, he frequently retired for Amu&s;ement. The Gate to this <HI>Gothick</HI> Building remaining, was turned into a Dwelling-hou&s;e, which was lately &s;old to the Right Honourable <HI>Henry Pelham,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who has beautified the old Part, and made additional Buildings to it in the &s;ame <HI>Gothick</HI> Style, and laid out the Grounds about it in &s;o elegant a Ta&s;te, as makes it one of the fine&s;t Seats in the Neighbourhood of <HI>London:</HI> but the Hou&s;e &s;tands &s;o low, as not to be &s;een until you come very near it; and the River <HI>Mole,</HI> running near the Back of the Hou&s;e, renders it very damp, which greatly dimini&s;hes the Plea&s;ure of the Place, tho' there has been no Co&s;t &s;pared to render it elegant.</P>
<P>Near <HI>E&s;her,</HI> on the Left-hand of the great Road, lies <HI>Claremont,</HI> which was a &s;mall Hou&s;e built under a Hill covered with Wood, by the late Sir <HI>John Vanbrugh,</HI> and purcha&s;ed by his Grace the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> who has been at a great Expence in beau|tifying the Gardens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and has added to the Hou&s;e a great Extent of Buildings, in the &s;ame Style with the original Hou&s;e; and has al&s;o built one large Room, in which his Grace entertains Foreign Em|ba&s;&s;adors, and where all the magnificent Dinners which the Duke makes in the Country, are &s;erved up. The Hou&s;e is &s;ituated &s;o near the Hill, that the Moi&s;ture i&s;&s;uing from thence, occa&s;ions it to be very damp; and the Winds, being reverberated back from the Woods on the Hou&s;e, cau&s;e mo&s;t of the Chimneys to &s;moke, &s;o that this is a bad Habitation
<PB N="228" REF="235">
in Winter: but as it is the Place to which his Grace u&s;ually retires from publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, whenever his Lei&s;ure will permit, he has not &s;pared Expence to render it as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible; tho', as &s;everal Per|&s;ons have had the Contrivance of his Gardens and Buildings, there is not any uniform Ta&s;te to be found in either, which is greatly to be regretted, &s;ince the noble Owner has been &s;o much intent on having it worthy of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>From hence, turning on the Right towards the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> we pa&s;s <HI>Walton,</HI> and <HI>Weybridge,</HI> where are &s;everal fine Seats; but particularly tho&s;e of the Earls of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and <HI>Portmore.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t of the&s;e is a noble Terrace-walk, ele|vated &s;o high above the Level of the neighbouring Ground, as to afford a Pro&s;pect of the Country, as al&s;o a View of the River.</P>
<P>The other Seat was beautified by the Counte&s;s of <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> II. Here is a Walk planted with <HI>Acacia</HI> Trees, which at that Time were e&s;teemed great Curio&s;ities.</P>
<P>The Country hereabout is very low and flat, &s;o that in Winter the Meadows are generally flooded, which renders the Air damp and cold, and the Roads are &s;ometimes almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able; but in Summer the Meadows afford a good Quantity of Hay, which &s;ufficiently recompen&s;es the Owner for the Di&s;ad|vantage of Situation.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Weybridge</HI> is a plea&s;ant &s;mall Seat, now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Philip Southcoat,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> called <HI>Wo|bourn-farm.</HI> The Hou&s;e is &s;ituated low, but is not very damp; and has the Advantage of being &s;creen'd from the Violence of &s;trong Winds, by tall Trees in the Neighbourhood. In the Front of the Hou&s;e is a &s;mall I&s;land, which in Summer is &s;tocked with Sheep, who are con&s;tantly feeding in View of the principal Rooms of the Hou&s;e. The Water &s;ur|rounding this I&s;land is conducted in a &s;erpentine
<PB N="229" REF="236">
Form, &s;o as to have little Re&s;emblance to Art. The Fields above the Hou&s;e are kept very neat, being rolled and fed; &s;o that there is a fine Carpet of Gra&s;s, the Walks round them being made dry by Gravel, and, on each Side, planted with &s;weet Shrubs and Flowers, in a rural manner. At the Upper-part of the&s;e Fields, is a Spot of Ground laid out in Gardens, which, being too regular, do not &s;o well corre&s;pond with the other Parts, which are laid out to an&s;wer the Name of a Farm, very pro|perly: but this Part has &s;omething of too much Stiffne&s;s and Regularity to agree with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>From this Spot of Ground is a mo&s;t delightful Pro&s;pect over a large Extent of Meadows bounded by the River <HI>Thames,</HI> which winds in an agreeable manner; and having frequently large We&s;t Country Barges floating in it, with their broad Sails, appear as &s;o many moving Objects in a Picture, and greatly enliven the Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>From hence al&s;o are &s;een Ten or Twelve Villages, and &s;everal fine Hou&s;es; and <HI>Chert&s;ey</HI> Bridge appears as if it were intended for a principal Object. Indeed the whole Spot may ju&s;tly be deemed one of the &s;weete&s;t Retirements near <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Keeping the River now on my Left, as I did be|fore on my Right-hand, drawing nearer to <HI>London,</HI> we came to <HI>Ham</HI> and <HI>Peter&s;ham,</HI> little Villages; the fir&s;t, famous for a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Palace of the late Duke of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> clo&s;e by the River, now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Earl of <HI>Dy&s;ert</HI>; a Hou&s;e King <HI>Charles</HI> II. u&s;ed to be frequently at, and was exceedingly plea&s;ed with. The Avenues of this fine Hou&s;e to the Land-&s;ide, lead up to the End of the Village of <HI>Peter&s;ham,</HI> where the Wall of <HI>New Park</HI> comes al&s;o clo&s;e to the Town, on the other Side; in an Angle of which &s;tood a mo&s;t delicious Hou&s;e, built by the late Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> Lord High Trea&s;urer in King <HI>James</HI> II.'s Reign, as al&s;o in Part of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s
<PB N="230" REF="237">
Reign. This fine Hou&s;e was burnt down in the Year 1720, by an accidental Fire, &s;o &s;udden and furious, that the Family, who were all at home, had &s;carce time to &s;ave their Lives.</P>
<P>Nor was the Hou&s;e, tho' &s;o exqui&s;itely fini&s;hed, &s;o beautiful within and without, the greate&s;t Lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained; the rich Furniture, the curious Collection of Paintings, and the ine&s;timable Library of the fir&s;t Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> and Author of that mo&s;t excellent <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Rebellion,</HI> of which the World knows &s;o much, were here wholly con&s;umed; a Lo&s;s irreparable, as the latter contained among other valuable Things, &s;everal Manu&s;cripts relating to tho&s;e Times, and to Things tran&s;acted by him&s;elf and by the King his Ma&s;ter, both at Home and Abroad, be&s;ides other rare and curious Collections made by that noble and learned Author in foreign Countries.</P>
<P>The Offices e&s;caped the Fate the Hou&s;e met with: and on the &s;ame Spot of Ground, where the Hou&s;e &s;tood, the Right Honourable the Lord <HI>Harrington,</HI> Secretary of State, erected another, after the De&s;ign of the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Burlington</HI>; and when I have &s;aid this, I need not &s;ay it is equally a convenient and elegant Edifice. The Front indeed next the Court, has not a very &s;triking Appearance, being very plain, and the Entrance into the Hou&s;e not greatly to be prai&s;ed: But the South Front next the Garden, tho' very plain, yet is bold and regular. The Apartments next the Garden, which are chiefly de&s;igned for State, are al&s;o very elegant, and beauti|fully fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Gardens, which before were crouded with Pluntations near the Hou&s;e, are now laid open in Lawns of Gra&s;s; and the Kitchen-garden, which was &s;ituated on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Hou&s;e, is re|moved out of Sight, and that Ground is now con|verted to an open Slope of Gra&s;s, which leads up to
<PB N="231" REF="238">
a Terrace of great Length; from which is a Pro&s;pect of the River <HI>Thames,</HI> the Town of <HI>Twickenham,</HI> and all the beautiful Seats round about that Part of the Country, almo&s;t to <HI>King&s;ton-bridge.</HI> On the other Side of the Terrace, on a ri&s;ing Ground, is a large Plantation of Wood; and on the Summit of the Hill is erected a fine Plea&s;ure-hou&s;e, which commands a Pro&s;pect of the Country every Way, for many Miles; &s;o that by Foreigners this View is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t beautiful of any near <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we came to <HI>Richmond,</HI> lately the de|lightful Retreat of his Maje&s;ty and his Royal Con|&s;ort the Queen, who took great Delight therein to the Time of her Death; and made not only va&s;t Improvements and Alterations there, but purcha&s;ed &s;everal fine Hou&s;es on <HI>Kew-green</HI>; as that of Lady <HI>Eyre,</HI> for his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke; that of Sir <HI>Thomas Abney</HI> for the Prince&s;&s;es; and his Royal High|ne&s;s Prince <HI>Frederick,</HI> mean while, made con&s;iderable Improvements in the fine Hou&s;e and Gardens belong|ing formerly to the Lady <HI>Capell</HI>; while her Maje&s;ty was u&s;ed to divert her&s;elf at her Royal Dairy-hou&s;e, and in her beautiful Hermitage, <HI>Merlin</HI>'s Cave, and in other charming Improvements, which &s;he made in the Park and Gardens of this delightful Place. All which are &s;o well known, that we need not in&s;i&s;t upon them.</P>
<P>The Court, being &s;o near, mu&s;t needs have filled <HI>Richmond,</HI> which was before a mo&s;t agreeable Re|treat for the fir&s;t and &s;econd-rate Gentry, with a great deal of the be&s;t Company in <HI>England.</HI> And indeed this Town, and the Country all round it, have much increa&s;ed in Buildings lately.</P>
<P>The Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Palmer&s;ton,</HI> the worthy Son and Succe&s;&s;or to the Honour and E&s;tate of the great Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI> has a fine Seat and Gardens (hard by) at <HI>Sheen:</HI> The Gardens were fini&s;hed, as well as contrived, by the great Genius of Sir <HI>William</HI>;
<PB N="232" REF="239">
and as they were his la&s;t Delight in Life, &s;o they were every way &s;uited to be &s;o, to a Man of his Sen&s;e and Capacity, who knew what kind of Life was be&s;t fitted to make a Man's la&s;t Days happy.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the Beauty with which the Banks of the <HI>Thames</HI> &s;hine on either Side of the River, from hence to <HI>London,</HI> much more than our Ance&s;tors, even but one Age ago, knew any thing of. If for plea&s;ant Villages, great Hou&s;es, Palaces, Gardens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it was true in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, according to the Poet, that
<Q><HI>The</HI> Thames <HI>with Royal</HI> Tyber <HI>may compare;</HI></Q>
What may be &s;aid of it now? when, for One fine Hou&s;e to be &s;een then, there are, for aught I know, an hundred, even as you &s;it in a Boat, and pa&s;s up and down the River.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, beginning from <HI>Ham-hou&s;e,</HI> as above, <HI>Rich|mond</HI> Palace &s;alutes the Eye, being formerly no more than a Lodge in the Park, but now makes a Royal Figure.</P>
<P>From <HI>Richmond</HI> to <HI>London</HI> the River Sides abound with Villages, and tho&s;e Villages &s;o full of beautiful Buildings, charming Gardens, and rich Habitations of Gentlemen of Quality, that nothing can equal it; no, not the Country for 20 Miles round <HI>Paris,</HI> tho' that indeed is a kind of Prodigy.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to view the&s;e Countries from any ri&s;ing Ground. and not be ravi&s;hed with the delight|ful Pro&s;pect.

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible in one Journey to de&s;cribe effectu|ally this Part of the County of <HI>Surrey,</HI> lying from <HI>King&s;ton</HI> to <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where I &s;et out: that is, including the Villages of <HI>Richmond, Peter&s;ham, Ea&s;t&s;heen, Mortlake, Putney, Wand&s;worth, Barn-elms, Batter&s;ea, Wimbleton, Tooting, Clapham, Camberwell, Peckham</HI> and <HI>Deptford</HI>; and I mu&s;t therefore quit the ample Subject, and come to <HI>South|wark,</HI> a Suburb to, rather than a Part of <HI>London:</HI> but of which this may be &s;aid with Ju&s;tice, that it would be
<Q><HI>A Royal City, were not</HI> London <HI>by.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To give you a brief De&s;cription of <HI>Southwark,</HI> it might be called a long Street, of about Nine Miles in Length, as it is now built on Ea&s;tward; reaching from <HI>Vaux-hall</HI> to <HI>London-bridge,</HI> and from the Bridge to <HI>Deptford,</HI> and up to <HI>Deptford</HI> Bridge, which parts it from <HI>Greenwich,</HI> all the Way wind|ing and turning as the River does; except only in that Part, which reaches from <HI>Cuckold's-point</HI> to <HI>Deptford,</HI> which winds &s;omewhat more than the River.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="241">In the Centre, which is oppo&s;ite to the Bridge, it is thicken'd with Buildings, and may be reckoned near a Mile broad; <HI>viz.</HI> from the Bridge to the End of <HI>Kent-&s;treet</HI> and <HI>Blackman-&s;treet,</HI> and about the <HI>Mint.</HI></P>
<P>The Borough of <HI>Southwark</HI> is exceeding populous. Take it as it was antiently bounded, it contained Nine Pari&s;hes; but as it is now extended, and joins with <HI>Deptford,</HI> it contains Eleven large Pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing we meet with con&s;iderable, is at the <HI>Spring-garden,</HI> ju&s;t at the Corner, where the Road turns away to go from <HI>Vaux-hall</HI> Turnpike towards <HI>Newington.</HI> There are the Remains of the Lines ca&s;t up in the Time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> which were repaired in the Civil Wars, as a Fortification to this Part of the Town; at the Corner was a very large Ba&s;tion, or Fort, which commanded the Pa&s;s on that Side; and farther on, at the Corner of <HI>St. George's-fields,</HI> by the <HI>Ducking Pond,</HI> was an|other; the Water of what is now called the <HI>Duck|ing Pond,</HI> &s;till appears to have been the Moat to the Fort; and the Lines are &s;till &s;o high, and undemo|li&s;hed, that it would be no difficult Matter to repair and perfect them again.</P>
<P>That this was formerly a <HI>Roman</HI> Camp or Station, is plain, from the many <HI>Roman</HI> Urns and Coins, <HI>Opera Te&s;&s;ellata,</HI> and other Antiquities, which have been frequently dug up hereabouts. And as there are pretty good Authorities of antient <HI>London</HI> lying on the South-&s;ide of the <HI>Thames,</HI> it is but a rea|&s;onable Conjecture, that the&s;e Lines were ca&s;t up and fortified, to prevent the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Britons</HI> into <HI>Kent</HI>; for the Military Way cro&s;&s;ed the River at the <HI>Hor&s;e-ferry</HI> at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> from thence pro|ceeded to <HI>Vaux-hall,</HI> then turned round to the <HI>Ducking Pond,</HI> went on to the Wind-mill in <HI>St. George's-fields,</HI> where it cro&s;&s;ed the Road to the End of <HI>Kent-&s;treet</HI>; where there was a very &s;trong
<PB N="235" REF="242">
Fortification of Stone, the Foundations of which were dug up in the Year 1685; this ran cro&s;s a Garden about a Quarter of a Mile from the Stones-end. In digging up of this Foundation there appeared two antient Pillars of a large Gate; upon each of them had been placed Heads with two Faces curiou&s;ly cut in Stone, one of which was taken up; but the other lying in a Quick&s;and, from whence the Springs flowed out pretty freely, was rendered more difficult to be taken up; and the Curio&s;ity of the People be|ing not very great, they contented them&s;elves with getting up one of the Heads; which was placed over the Gardener's Door, where it remained for &s;everal Years, until it was known to the Learned Dr. <HI>Woodward,</HI> who purcha&s;ed it, and kept it in his valuable Collection of Curio&s;ities. The&s;e Lines were drawn from hence to the <HI>Grange</HI> near <HI>Bermond|&s;ey-&s;treet</HI>; where you &s;ee another Fort &s;o plain, and &s;o undemoli&s;hed, (the Gra&s;s now growing over the Works, and tho', on the Ba&s;tion it&s;elf, there is frequently Corn &s;owed) that it is almo&s;t as vi&s;ible as it was when it was fir&s;t thrown down.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS I came down from <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> in my la&s;t Circuit, by the South Bank of the <HI>Thames,</HI> on the <HI>Surrey</HI> Side of the River; &s;o I go up to <HI>Hampton-court,</HI> now, on the North Bank, and on the <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> Side; which I mention, becau&s;e, as the Sides of the Country bordering on the River lie parallel, &s;o the Beauty of the Country, the plea&s;ant Situations, the Splendor of innumerable fine Buildings, Noblemens and Gentlemens Hou&s;es, and Citizens Retreats, are &s;o equal a Match to what I had de&s;cribed on the other Side, that one knows not to which to give the Preference: but as I mu&s;t &s;peak of them again, when I come to write of the County of <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> which I have now purpo&s;ely omitted; I pa&s;s them over here, except the Palace of <HI>Hampton</HI> only, which I mentioned in <HI>Middle|&s;ex,</HI> for the Rea&s;ons above.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="244"><HI>Hampton-court</HI> lies on the North Bank of the River <HI>Thames,</HI> about Two &s;mall Miles from <HI>King&s;ton.</HI> It was built by Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> and fell to the Crown, when the King &s;eized his Effects and E&s;tate, as did al&s;o <HI>Whitehall,</HI> another Hou&s;e of the Cardinal's building.</P>
<P>Whoever knew <HI>Hampton-court</HI> before it was begun to be rebuilt, or alter'd, by the late King <HI>William,</HI> mu&s;t acknowledge, it was a very complete Palace then, and fit for a King; and tho' it might not, according to the modern Method of Building, or of Gardening, pa&s;s for a Thing exqui&s;itely fine, yet it &s;hewed a Situation exceedingly capable of Improve|ment, and of being made one of the mo&s;t delightful Palaces in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>This her Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Mary</HI> was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of, that while the King had ordered the pulling down the old Apartments, and building them up in that mo&s;t beautiful Form, which we &s;ee them now appear in, her Maje&s;ty, impatient of enjoying &s;o agreeable a Retreat, fixed upon a Building formerly made u&s;e of chiefly for landing from the River, and therefore called the <HI>Water Gallery</HI>; here &s;he ordered all the little, neat, curious Things to be done, which &s;uited her own Conveniency, and made it the plea&s;ante&s;t little Place within Doors, that could po&s;|&s;ibly be made; tho' its Situation would not allow it to &s;tand after the great Building was fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Queen had here her Gallery of Beauties, being the Pictures, at full Length, of the principal Ladies in her Retinue. Her Maje&s;ty's Apartments for her private Retreat only, were exqui&s;itely fur|ni&s;hed, and there were among the Furniture &s;everal curious Pieces of her own Work.</P>
<P>The Ground on the South-we&s;t Side of the Building, has received many Alterations &s;ince the pulling down of the Water-gallery (which &s;tood before this hand&s;ome Front of the Hou&s;e, and inter|cepted
<PB N="238" REF="245">
the Pro&s;pect of it from the River). This Spot was then laid out into &s;mall Inclo&s;ures, &s;ur|rounded with tall Hedges, to break the Violence of the Winds, and render them proper for the Reception of &s;uch Exotick Plants in Summer, as were removed out of the Con&s;ervatories during that Sea&s;on. In each of the&s;e Places is contrived a Ba&s;on, which is con&s;tantly &s;upplied with Water for the Support of the&s;e Plants in dry Weather; and as the&s;e are &s;ituated near the great Apartments, mo&s;t of the Plants may be viewed from the Windows: and the lower Part of the Hou&s;e, under the great Apartments, being contrived for a Greenhou&s;e, the Plants need not be carried far, when they are removed out or into the Con&s;ervatory, which was very properly contrived by the De&s;igners.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t-end of this Spot was a large Hot-hou&s;e, for the maintaining &s;uch tender Exotick Plants, as require a large Share of Warmth to pre|&s;erve them in this Climate. Of all the&s;e Parts of Gardening Queen <HI>Mary</HI> was &s;o very fond, that &s;he allowed a hand&s;ome Salary to Dr. <HI>Plukenet,</HI> a very learned Botani&s;t, for overlooking and regi&s;tering the curious Collection of Plants, which were then in that Garden; but, &s;ince the Death of that Queen, the&s;e Things have been &s;o much neglected, that very few of the mo&s;t curious Plants are now in Being there, which is much to be lamented; for, however the Ta&s;te for this Part of Gardening may have with Rea&s;on been neglected by private Per&s;ons, yet, &s;urely, at a Royal Palace, all the&s;e Things &s;hould be kept up in the utmo&s;t Magnificence, as an Encou|ragement to Ingenuity, and for the Honour of the Kingdom. This Ta&s;te was, by <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. of <HI>France,</HI> carried to a very great Height; and had the Per&s;ons employed by that Prince been &s;o well ac|quainted with the Con&s;truction of the&s;e Con&s;erva|tories, as many of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are at this Day, we
<PB N="239" REF="246">
might have expected, in his Royal Gardens, to have &s;een mo&s;t of the curious Plants in the known Parts of the World.</P>
<P>Here &s;tand advanced, on Two Pede&s;tals of Stone, Two Marble Va&s;es, or Flower-pots, of exqui&s;ite Workman&s;hip; the one done by an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and the other by a <HI>German.</HI> 'Tis hard to &s;ay which is the be&s;t Performance, tho' the doing of it was a kind of Trial of Skill between them; but it gives us room, without any Partiality, to &s;ay they were both Ma&s;ters of their Art.</P>
<P>The Parterre on that Side de&s;cends from the Ter|race-walk by Steps, and on the Left a Terrace goes down to the Water-&s;ide, overlooking the Gar|den on the Ea&s;tward Front, and affords a mo&s;t plea|&s;ant Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>This Part of the Garden was at fir&s;t laid out in a Parterre of Scroll-work in Box, which was not only very co&s;tly at fir&s;t making, but was al&s;o very ex|pen&s;ive in keeping con&s;tantly clipped; which, to|gether with the ill Scent, which frequently reached to the Royal Apartments, occa&s;ioned its being de|moli&s;hed, and the Ground di&s;po&s;ed into another Form. And if at the &s;ame time all the &s;horn ever-green Trees had been thrown out, and a finer Di&s;po&s;ition made of the Ground, it would have much better corre&s;ponded with the noble Apartments which over|look it, than it does at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>On the North Side of the Hou&s;e, where the Chapel, and &s;ome Part of the old Buildings, required to be covered from View, the Ground was laid out in a Wilderne&s;s, with a Labyrinth &s;urrounded by high E&s;palier Hedges; and this was, at that time, thought one of the fine&s;t di&s;po&s;ed Parts of the Gar|den. But as the whole Contrivance of the Plan|tations is in regular &s;trait Walks, bounded on each Side by tall clipped Hedges, which divide the whole Ground into angular Quarters, to every Per&s;on of
<PB N="240" REF="247">
Ta&s;te it mu&s;t be very far from affording any Plea&s;ure, &s;ince nothing can be more di&s;agreeable than to be immured between Hedges, &s;o as to have the Eye confined to a &s;trait Walk, and the Beauty of the Trees growing in the Quarters, intirely &s;ecluded from the Eye. And at the &s;ame time as you are walking in this unmeaning Plantation, you are denied the Benefit of Shade, by being confined to the&s;e regular Walks, where it would be deemed an unpardonable Fault, to &s;uffer the neighbouring Trees to diffu&s;e their Branches over the&s;e &s;horn Hedges; &s;o that, in the mid&s;t of a Wood, a Per&s;on may faint for Shade in a &s;ultry Day, the Air being excluded from the&s;e Walks by the taller Trees in the Quarters; and pent up Air is much more trouble&s;ome in hot Weather, than the Heat of the Sun in the mo&s;t open expo&s;ed Plain.</P>
<P>As this Wilderne&s;s lies oppo&s;ite to <HI>Bu&s;hy-park,</HI> &s;o there was de&s;igned a grand Entrance thro' it to the Palace, fronting the Gates of the Park; where Two large Pillars were erected, to &s;upport a mag|nificent Iron Gate, which was de&s;igned to have been put up there; but how it came to be left unfini&s;hed, and the pitiful low Gates (which by no means cor|re&s;pond with the Pillars) put in the Place, I could never learn.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e it&s;elf is every way an&s;werable on the Out&s;ide to the beautiful Pro&s;pect, and the Two Fronts are the large&s;t, and, beyond Compari&s;on, the fine&s;t of the kind in <HI>England.</HI> The great Stairs go up from the &s;econd Court of the Palace on the Right|hand, and lead you to the South Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>King <HI>William</HI> brought into <HI>England,</HI> and placed here in a Gallery, built purpo&s;ely for them, the famous <HI>Cartoons,</HI> as they are called, which are Five Pieces of &s;uch Paintings, as are not to be match'd in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> It is reported, but with what Truth, I know not, that the late <HI>French</HI> King offer'd 100,000 <HI>Louis</HI>
<PB N="241" REF="248">
<HI>d'Ors</HI> for the&s;e Pictures. The King brought a great many other fine Pieces to <HI>England,</HI> and from him the Love of fine Paintings &s;o univer&s;ally &s;pread it&s;elf among the Nobility and Per&s;ons of Figure all over the Kingdom, that it is incredible what Collections have been made by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen &s;ince that Time; and how all <HI>Europe</HI> has been romaged, as we may &s;ay, for Pictures to bring over hither, where, for Twenty Years together, they brought in va&s;t Profit to &s;uch as collected them for Sale. But the Rates are abated &s;ince, and we are now glutted with the Copies and Frauds of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Painters, who have impo&s;ed gro&s;ly upon us.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Mary</HI> lived not to &s;ee this Palace com|pletely fini&s;h'd; and, 'tis &s;aid, King <HI>William</HI> de|&s;ign'd to have made it more capacious and noble, had he lived.</P>
<P>After the Death of King <HI>William, Hampton-Court</HI> &s;eem'd in a manner neglected. It is an Ob|&s;ervation made by &s;ome, that <HI>Hampton Court</HI> has, ever &s;ince the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. been fa|voured by every alternate Prince; King <HI>Charles</HI> I. delighting in Country Retirements, took great Plea|&s;ure here, and, had he liv'd, had purpo&s;ed to im|prove it con&s;iderably; but it became at la&s;t one of his Pri&s;ons.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> II. may well be &s;aid to have a Di&s;|like to the Place, for the Treatment his Royal Fa|ther met with there; and particularly as <HI>Cromwell</HI> afterwards made it his Summer Re&s;idence. He there|fore cho&s;e <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and be&s;tow'd a va&s;t Sum in beau|tifying the Ca&s;tle there, which brought it to the Perfection we &s;ee it in at this Day, &s;ome few Al|terations excepted, made in the Time of King <HI>Wil|liam.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> took but little Delight in retired Palaces, his Bent and Ta&s;te inclining another way.
<PB N="242" REF="249">
But King <HI>William</HI> fix'd upon <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and improv'd it as before-mention'd.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Anne</HI> being taken up for one Part of her Reign, in her kind Regards to the Prince her Spou&s;e, was obliged to con&s;ult his Health, and re&s;ide where that confin'd him, which for the mo&s;t part was at <HI>Ken&s;ington,</HI> where he died; but her Maje&s;ty always di&s;cover'd her Delight for <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> where &s;he cho&s;e the little Hou&s;e, as 'twas call'd, oppo&s;ite to the Ca&s;tle, and frequently took the Air in her Chai&s;e in the Parks and Fore&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Reign of King <HI>George</HI> I. <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> came into Reque&s;t again.</P>
<P>From <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> I directed my Cour&s;e for a Journey into the South-we&s;t Part of <HI>England</HI>; and, to take up my Beginning where I concluded my la&s;t, I cro&s;s'd to <HI>Chert&s;ey</HI> on the <HI>Thames,</HI> a Town I men|tion'd before; from whence cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Black De|&s;art</HI> of <HI>Bag&s;hot,</HI> I took in my Way to <HI>Hamp&s;hire, Ockingham</HI> in <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> lying on the Skirts of <HI>Wind|&s;or Fore&s;t</HI>: it is a pretty large Town, and has a well-frequented Market, and a good Market-hou&s;e in the Middle. It is govern'd by an Alderman, Recorder and Burge&s;&s;es, has a Free-&s;chool, and like|wi&s;e an Ho&s;pital, with a Chaplain belonging to it. It carries on a good Trade in Silk Stockens and Cloth.</P>
<P>From hence I fell down towards <HI>Ba&s;ing&s;toke,</HI> which is &s;ituate in the mid&s;t of Woods, and rich fertile Pa&s;tures: the Country round about is &s;pread with the Hou&s;es of the Nobility and Gentry. A little before we came to the Town, we pa&s;s'd by a Hou&s;e built out of the Ruins, and on the Scite of <HI>Old Ba&s;ing-hou&s;e,</HI> a famous Fortre&s;s in the Time of the Civil Wars, belonging to the then Marquis of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> Ance&s;tor of the Duke of <HI>Bolton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="250">This Hou&s;e, gari&s;on'd by a re&s;olute Band of old Soldiers, under the Command of the Marquis, was a great Curb to the Parliament Party throughout that whole War; till, after a vigorous Defence, it was taken, and the brave Marquis in it, by <HI>Crom|well,</HI> who, in Revenge for the ob&s;tinate Re&s;i&s;tance it made, put almo&s;t all the Gari&s;on to the Sword, and burnt down the noble Fabrick to the Ground, which he &s;aid was fitter for the Re&s;idence of an Emperor than a Subject. The pre&s;ent Hou&s;e is in no wi&s;e equal to the Magnificence which Fame gives to the antient Hou&s;e; who&s;e Strength of Building was &s;uch as to re&s;i&s;t the Battery of Cannon in &s;eve|ral Attacks. 'Tis incredible what Booty the Gari|&s;on of this Place pick'd up, lying, as they did, ju&s;t on the great We&s;tern Road, where they intercepted the Carriers, plunder'd the Waggons, and &s;uffer'd nothing to pa&s;s; to the great Interruption of the Trade of the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ba&s;ing&s;toke</HI> is a Corporation, and a large populous Town: it has a good Market for Corn, e&s;pe|cially Barley, as there are a great many Malt&s;ters there. Some few Years ago a Manufacture of making Druggets and Shalloons, was &s;et up here, and as &s;ucce&s;sfully carried on, which employs a great Num|ber of poor People.</P>
<P>Near this Town a bloody Battle was fought in 871, between the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>From this Town the great We&s;tern Road goes on to <HI>Whitchurch,</HI> a mean Town, which however has a Market, and is govern'd by a Mayor. North-ea&s;t of which lyes <HI>King&s;clere,</HI> a plea&s;ant Market-town on the <HI>Oxford</HI> Road from <HI>Ba&s;ing&s;toke.</HI> It was an|tiently famous for having been the Seat of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, and from thence takes its Name.</P>
<P>But I had like to have forgot the famous <HI>Vin|domia,</HI> or <HI>Silche&s;ter,</HI> which is &s;ituated in <HI>Hants,</HI>
<PB N="244" REF="251">
on the Borders of <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> and is famous for its An|tiquity.</P>
<P>Its Situation is very high, hid with Wood. Many were the <HI>Roman</HI> Roads which met here, tho' now &s;carce any; which is one Rea&s;on why 'tis &s;o little known: another is its want of Inns for the Accom|modation of Travellers; for <HI>Alderma&s;ton,</HI> a pretty neat Village, beautifully &s;ituated, which is Three Miles di&s;tant, is the neare&s;t Town where Lodging is to be found. The Walls of this City are &s;tanding, more or le&s;s perfect, quite round; perhaps the mo&s;t intire in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, e&s;pecially the North|&s;ide, which is a mo&s;t agreeable Sight. It is com|po&s;ed of Flint and Rag-&s;tone. There was a broad Ditch quite round, and now almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able, and full of Springs. Here-and-there <HI>Roman</HI> Bricks are left in the Walls. Tho' on the Out&s;ide they are of a con&s;iderable Height, yet the Ground within is &s;o rai&s;ed, as nearly to be equal to the Top, and that quite round cover'd with Oaks, and other Timber|trees, of no mean Bulk. <HI>Con&s;tantius,</HI> the Son of <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great,</HI> is &s;aid to have built it, and &s;ow'd Corn in the Track of the Walls, as an Omen of their Perpetuity. Now indeed the whole City is arable, and in the Fields <HI>Roman</HI> Bricks, and other Reliques, are &s;catter'd, and Coins daily found. It has only one Farm-hou&s;e and a Church. The Reverend and Learned Mr. <HI>Betham,</HI> late Mini&s;ter of this Place, is buried under the North Wall of the Chancel without-&s;ide; within is another Monu|ment of a Per&s;on of Quality. They both were drown'd in <HI>Fleet-ditch.</HI> A Spring ri&s;es from under the Wall of the Church-yard.</P>
<P>Five hundred Feet without the City, on the North-ea&s;t Side, is a great Curio&s;ity, which the Vul|gar think was a Ca&s;tle, but in reality an Amphi|theatre, in all re&s;pects like that of <HI>Dorche&s;ter.</HI> This

noble Antiquity has from Time immemorial been a Yard for Cattle, and a Watering-pond; &s;o that it is a Wonder their Trampling has not defaced it much more than it has. My Re&s;olution being to take in my Way what I had pa&s;s'd by before, I was obliged to go off to the Left-hand, to <HI>Alresford</HI> and <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alresford</HI> was a flouri&s;hing Market-town, and tho' it had no great Trade, and very little, if any, Ma|nufactures, yet, what is very remarkable, there was no Collection made in the Town for the Poor, nor any low enough to take Alms of the Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>But this happy Circum&s;tance, which &s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd <HI>Alresford</HI> from all her Neighbours, was brought to an End in 1710, when, by a &s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing Fire, the whole Town, with both the Church and Market-hou&s;e, was reduced to a Heap of Rubbi&s;h; and, except a few poor Huts at the remote&s;t Ends of the Town, not a Hou&s;e left &s;tand|ing. The Town is &s;ince very hand&s;omely rebuilt, and the neighbouring Gentlemen contributed largely to the Relief of the People, e&s;pecially by &s;ending in Timber towards their Building.</P>
<P>Here is a very large Pond, or Lake of Water, kept up to a Head by a &s;trong <HI>Battre d'eau,</HI> or Dam, which, 'tis &s;aid, was made by the <HI>Romans</HI>; and is part of the great <HI>Roman</HI> Highway, which leads from <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Alton,</HI> and, as &s;uppo&s;ed, on to <HI>London,</HI> tho' we no-where &s;ee any Remains of it, except between <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Alton,</HI> and chiefly between this Town and the la&s;t mention'd.</P>
<P>Near this Town, a little North-we&s;t, the Duke of <HI>Bolton</HI> has another Seat, which tho' not large, is a very hand&s;ome beautiful Palace, and the Gardens not only very exact, but very finely &s;ituate, the Pro|&s;pect and Vi&s;ta's noble and great, and the Whole very well kept. His Grace has no le&s;s than Three Seats almo&s;t within Sight of one another, <HI>viz. Ab|bot&s;tone, Ba&s;ing,</HI> and <HI>Hawkwood.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="253">From hence at the End of Seven Miles over the <HI>Downs,</HI> we come to the very antient City of <HI>Win|che&s;ter,</HI> called in <HI>Briti&s;h Caer Gwent,</HI> which &s;igni|fies the white Town, from the chalky Hills near it. Not only the great Church, which is &s;o famous all over <HI>Europe,</HI> and has been &s;o much talk'd of, but even the whole City, has, at a Di&s;tance, a venerable and antient Face; and yet here are many modern Buildings too, and &s;ome very hand&s;ome; as the College Schools, with the Epi&s;copal Palace, built by Bi&s;hop <HI>Morley,</HI> &s;ince the Civil Wars; the old Palace of the Bi&s;hop having been ruin'd by that known Church-Incendiary, Sir <HI>William Waller,</HI> and his Crew of Plunderers; who, if my Information is not wrong, de&s;troy'd more Monuments of the Dead, and defac'd more Churches, than all the <HI>Round-heads</HI> in <HI>England</HI> be&s;ide.</P>
<P>This Church, and the Schools al&s;o, are accurately de&s;crib'd by &s;everal Writers, e&s;pecially by the <HI>Mo|na&s;ticon,</HI> where their Antiquity and Original is fully &s;et forth: the Out&s;ide of the Church is as plain and coar&s;e, as if the Founders had abhorr'd Ornaments. There is neither Statue, nor a Niche for a Statue, to be &s;een on all the Out&s;ide, no carv'd Work, no Spires, Towers, Pinacles, Balu&s;trades, or any thing but mere Walls, Buttre&s;&s;es, Windows, and Quoins, nece&s;|&s;ary to the Support and Order of the Building: it has no Steeple, but a &s;hort Tower cover'd flat, as if the Top of it had fallen down, and it had been cover'd in ha&s;te to keep the Rain out, till they had Time to build it up again.</P>
<P>But the In&s;ide of the Church has many very good things in it, and worth Ob&s;ervation; it was for &s;ome Ages the Burying-place of many <HI>Engli&s;h, Saxon,</HI> and <HI>Norman</HI> Kings; who&s;e Remains the im|pious Soldiers, in the Civil Wars, threw again&s;t the painted Gla&s;s. The Reliques of &s;ome of the&s;e, at the Repair of the Church, were collected by Bi&s;hop
<PB N="247" REF="254">
<HI>Fox,</HI> and, being put together into Six large wooden Che&s;ts, lin'd with Lead, were again interr'd at the Foot of the great Wall in the Choir, Three on one Side, and Three on the other; with an Account who&s;e Bones are in each Che&s;t, viz. <HI>Rufus, Egbert, Adulphus, Edredus, Edmundus, Canutus,</HI> and tho&s;e of Queen <HI>Emma.</HI> Queen <HI>Mary</HI> was here marry'd to <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> The Chair u&s;ed in that Cere|mony is &s;till pre&s;erv'd. In the Body of the Church is a pretty Cro&s;s of <HI>Gothick</HI> Workman&s;hip, but ill repair'd. The Steps a&s;cending to the Choir make a fine Shew, having the Statues of King <HI>James</HI> I. and his Son <HI>Charles,</HI> in Copper, finely ca&s;t; the fir&s;t on the Right-hand, and the other on the Left, as you go up to the Choir.</P>
<P>The Choir is &s;aid to be the longe&s;t in <HI>England.</HI> The Ornaments of the Choir are the Effects of the Bounty of &s;everal Bi&s;hops; the fine Altar (the no|ble&s;t in <HI>England</HI> by much) was given by Bi&s;hop <HI>Mor|ley</HI>; the Roof, and the Coat of Arms of the <HI>Saxon</HI> and <HI>Norman</HI> Kings, by Bi&s;hop <HI>Fox</HI>; and the fine Throne for the Bi&s;hop in the Choir, was given by Bi&s;hop <HI>Mew</HI> in his Life-time; and it was well it was; for if he had order'd it by Will, there is Rea|&s;on to believe it had never been done: that Reverend Prelate, notwith&s;tanding he enjoy'd &s;o rich a Bi|&s;hoprick, &s;carce leaving Money enough behind him to pay for his Coffin.</P>
<P>There are a great many Per&s;ons of Rank buried in this Church, be&s;ides the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings mention'd above; particularly, here lies, as they told us, un|der a grey Marble, <HI>Lucius,</HI> the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian King of this I&s;land, who dy'd 180 Years after Chri&s;t; and, as is pretended, founded the Church where the Cathedral now &s;tands. There are al&s;o the Monuments of Bi&s;hop <HI>Fox,</HI> Founder of <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti</HI> College, <HI>Oxon</HI>; Bi&s;hop <HI>Wainfleet,</HI> Founder of <HI>Magdalen</HI> Col|lege, in the &s;ame Univer&s;ity; in Regard to who&s;e

The Tomb of <HI>William of Wickham,</HI> the magnificent Founder of this Cathe|dral, very richly gilt. Ju&s;t under the Altar lies a Son of <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> without any Monu|ment; and behind the Altar, under a very fine Mo|nument, lies the famous Lord Trea&s;urer <HI>We&s;ton,</HI> Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> Lord High Trea&s;urer of <HI>England</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. His Effigies is in Copper Armour, at full Length, with his Head rais'd on Three Cu&s;hions of the &s;ame, and is a very magnificent Work. There is al&s;o a very fine Monu|ment of Cardinal <HI>Beaufort,</HI> in his Cardinal's Robes and Hat.</P>
<P>The Monument of Sir <HI>John Cloberry</HI> de&s;erves Notice more for his Story, than for any thing ex|traordinary in the Figure. This Gentleman was the Per&s;on &s;olely entru&s;ted with the Secret of the Re|&s;toration of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. as the Me&s;&s;enger that pa&s;s'd between General <HI>Monk</HI> on one hand, and Mr. <HI>Montague,</HI> and others intru&s;ted by King <HI>Cha.</HI> II. on the other; by which Service Sir <HI>John,</HI> then a private Mu&s;queteer only, rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the Ho|nour of a Knight, with the Reward of a good E&s;tate from the Bounty of the King.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to &s;ay a Word or two of the famous <HI>William of Wickham,</HI> who built the Body of the Church.</P>
<P>He was a Courtier before a Bi&s;hop; and tho' he had no large Share of Learning, he was a great Pro|moter of it: his natural Genius was much beyond his acquired Parts, and his Skill in Politicks beyond his Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Knowledge. He is &s;aid to have put his Ma&s;ter, King <HI>Edward</HI> III. to whom he was Secretary of State, upon the Two great Projects which made his Reign &s;o glorious; <HI>viz.</HI> (1.) Upon &s;etting up his Claim to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> which
<PB N="249" REF="256">
brought on the War with <HI>France,</HI> in which that Prince was three times victorious in Battle. (2.) Upon in&s;tituting the Order of the Garter; in which he obtain'd the Honour for the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Winche|&s;ter</HI> to be always Prelates of the Order, as an Ap|pendix to the Bi&s;hoprick; and he him&s;elf was the fir&s;t: the En&s;igns of that Honour are join'd with his Epi&s;copal Ornaments, in the robing of his Effi|gies on the Monument above.</P>
<P>To the great Honour of this Bi&s;hop there are other Foundations of his, as much to his Fame as that of this Church, of which I &s;hall &s;peak in their Places, but particularly the College in this City, which is a noble Foundation indeed. The Building con&s;i&s;ts of Two large Courts, in which are the Lodgings for the Ma&s;ters and Seventy Scholars, and in the Centre a very noble Chapel; beyond that, in the &s;econd Court, are the Schools, with a large Cloi&s;ter beyond them, and &s;ome Inclo&s;ures laid open for the Diver&s;ion of the Scholars. There al&s;o is a great Hall, where the Scholars dine. In the Chapel Window belonging to the College is good painted Gla&s;s of Imagery. In the middle of the Cloi&s;ters is the Library, a &s;trong Stone Building, well contriv'd to prevent Fire.</P>
<P>In digging the Foundation of a Hou&s;e near the College, in a Stone Coffin, was found a Stone &s;et in a Gold Ring, with this In&s;cription in very odd Cha|racters; &s;uppo&s;ed to be about the Sixth Century, <HI>Domino Comite fidele meo,</HI> i. e. <HI>The Lord being my Guide and faithful Companion.</HI></P>
<P>Over the Door of the School &s;tands a very good Statue of the Founder, made by <HI>Cibber,</HI> who&s;e Workman&s;hip are the two excellent Figures over <HI>Bethlehem-gate,</HI> the Father of that excellent Come|dian <HI>Colley Cibber,</HI> Poet-Laureat.</P>
<P>The Scholars have Exhibitions at a certain time of Continuance here, if they plea&s;e to &s;tudy, in
<PB N="250" REF="257">
the new College at <HI>Oxford,</HI> built by the &s;ame noble Benefactor.</P>
<P>The Clergy here live very elegantly in the Clo&s;e belonging to the Cathedral; where, be&s;ides the Bi|&s;hop's Palace, mentioned above, are very good Hou&s;es, and very hand&s;omely built, for the Preben|daries, Canons, and other Dignitaries of this Church: The Deanry is a very plea&s;ant Dwelling, the Gar|dens are large, and the River runs thro' them; but the Floods in Winter &s;ometimes much incommode them.</P>
<P>This School has fully an&s;wer'd the End of the Founder, who, tho' he was no great Scholar, re&s;olv'd to erect a Hou&s;e for making the Ages to come more learned than tho&s;e that went before; and many learned and great Men have been edu|cated here.</P>
<P>As the City &s;tands in a Vale on the Bank, and at the Conjunction of Two &s;mall Rivers, &s;o the Coun|try ri&s;ing every way, but ju&s;t as the Cour&s;e of the Water keeps the Valley open, you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, as you go out of the Gates, go up Hill every way: but when once a&s;cended, you come to the mo&s;t charming Plains, and mo&s;t plea&s;ant Country of that Kind in <HI>England</HI>; which continues, with very &s;mall Inter&s;ections of Rivers and Valleys, for above Fifty Miles, as I &s;hall ob&s;erve more particularly in the Sequel of this Journey.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t Gate of this City was antiently a Ca&s;tle, in which, 'tis &s;aid, the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings kept their Court, which however is doubtful, and mu&s;t be meant of the <HI>We&s;t-Saxons</HI> only. As to the Tale of King <HI>Arthur</HI>'s round Table, and his Two Dozen of Knights, which Table being one Piece of Wood, &s;upported by Marble Pillars, they &s;till &s;hew in the Town-hall, &s;aid to be Part of the &s;aid Ca&s;tle, as a Piece of Antiquity of 1200 Years &s;tanding, and has, as they pretend, the Names of the &s;aid Knights in
<PB N="251" REF="258">
<HI>Saxon</HI> Characters, and yet &s;uch as no Man can read: all this Story I &s;ee no Ground to give the lea&s;t Credit to.</P>
<P>Where this Ca&s;tle was &s;aid to &s;tand, the late King <HI>Charles</HI> II. mark'd out a very noble De&s;ign; which, had he lived, would certainly have made that Part of the Country the Re&s;ort of the Quality and Gentry of all Parts of the Kingdom; for the Country hereabout far exceeds that of <HI>Newmarket-heath,</HI> for all kinds of Sport and Diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Building was &s;o far pro&s;ecuted, that the Front next the City was carried up to the Roof, and cover'd; but what was further intended was not proceeded on. There was a Street of Hou&s;es de|&s;igned from the Gate of the Palace down to the Town, but it was never begun to be built; the Park mark'd out was exceeding large, near Ten Miles in Circumference, and ended We&s;t upon the open Downs, in View of <HI>Stockbridge.</HI></P>
<P>This Hou&s;e, with a Royal Revenue, was after|wards &s;ettled by Parliament, as an Appenage upon Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark</HI> for his Life, in ca&s;e he had out-liv'd the Queen: but his Royal Highne&s;s dying before her Maje&s;ty, all Hope of &s;eeing this De&s;ign perfected, or the Hou&s;e fini&s;h'd, is now va|ni&s;h'd. And his late Maje&s;ty King <HI>George</HI> I. made a Pre&s;ent to the Duke of <HI>Bolton</HI> of the fine Pillars of <HI>Italian</HI> Marble, which were to have &s;upported its Stair-ca&s;e.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other publick Edifices in this City, and in the Neighbourhood, which I have not Room to de&s;cribe, as the Ho&s;pitals, and Building adjoining near the Ea&s;t-gate. Towards the North is a Piece of an old Mona&s;tery undemoli&s;h'd, and which is &s;till pre&s;erv'd to the Religion, being the Re&s;idence of &s;ome private Roman Catholick Gentlemen, where they have an Oratory, and, as they &s;ay, live &s;till ac|cording to the Rules of <HI>St. Benedict.</HI> This Building is call'd <HI>Hide-hou&s;e</HI>; and as they live very u&s;efully,
<PB N="252" REF="259">
and to the highe&s;t Degree obliging among their Neighbours, they meet with no Ob&s;truction from any body.</P>
<P>Beyond the River Ea&s;tward is a high Hill call'd <HI>St. Giles</HI>'s, from an Ho&s;pital who&s;e Ruins only are now vi&s;ible; and a Church-yard &s;eeming to have been a Camp, be&s;ides the Marks of Ba&s;tions, and Works of Fortifications in the modern Style. Here <HI>Waltheof,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> was beheaded by Order of King <HI>William</HI> I. who&s;e Body was carried to <HI>Crowland,</HI> and &s;aid to work Mi|racles.</P>
<P><HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> is a Place of no Trade, other than is naturally occa&s;ion'd by the Inhabitants of the City, and neighbouring Villages, one with another: here is no Manufacture, no Navigation; there was in|deed an Attempt to make the River navigable from <HI>Southampton,</HI> and it was once made practicable; but it never an&s;wered the Expence, &s;o as to give En|couragement to the Undertakers to keep it up.</P>
<P>Here is a great deal of good Company; and Abundance of Gentry being in the Neighbourhood, it adds to the Sociablene&s;s of the Place: the Clergy al&s;o here, are, generally &s;peaking, rich, and very numerous.</P>
<P>The magnificent Ho&s;pital called <HI>Holy-cro&s;s,</HI> on the South of this City, at a Mile's Di&s;tance on the Road to <HI>Southampton,</HI> is worth Notice: it was founded by Bi&s;hop <HI>Blois.</HI> The Church is in the Form of a Cro&s;s, and has a large &s;quare Tower. Every Traveller, that knocks at the Door of this Hou&s;e, in his Way, and a&s;ks for it, claims the Relief of a Piece of white Bread, and a Cup of Beer; and this Donation is &s;till continued. A Quantity of good Beer is &s;et apart every Day to be given away; and what is left is di&s;tributed to other Poor, but none of it kept to next Day.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="260">How the Revenues of this Ho&s;pital, which &s;hould maintain the Ma&s;ter, and Thirty private Gentlemen, whom they call <HI>Fellows,</HI> but ought to call <HI>Brothers,</HI> are now reduced to maintain only Fourteen, while the Ma&s;ter lives in a Figure equal to the be&s;t Gen|tleman in the County, would be well worth the Inquiry of a proper Vi&s;itor, if &s;uch can be nam'd. 'Tis a Thing worthy of Notice, when publick Charities, de&s;ign'd for the Relief of the Poor, are imbezzled by the Rich, and turn'd to the Support of Luxury and Pride.</P>
<P>An Infirmary is e&s;tabli&s;h'd lately in this Town, by voluntary Sub&s;cription, after the laudable Examples of tho&s;e of <HI>St. James</HI>'s <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>St. George</HI>'s at <HI>Hyde-Park Corner,</HI> and has met with great Succe&s;s, being principally owing to the Zeal and Pains of the Reverend Doctor <HI>Alured Clarke.</HI> I have not room to &s;ay all that might be &s;aid on this Head, and &s;o mu&s;t refer you to the Account given by the Doctor, of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s, Rules and Orders, of this excellent In&s;titution.</P>
<P>I made an Excur&s;ion from <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> to &s;ee the antient Town of <HI>Rom&s;ey,</HI> noted for its delightful Situation, having all round it Woods, Corn-fields, Meadows and Pa&s;tures. The River, and Rivulets, which are many, have a rapid Cour&s;e. The Town was que&s;tionle&s;s <HI>Roman,</HI> and its Name declares as much. The Church is a noble Pile of Architecture, arch'd with Stone, in Form of a Cro&s;s, with Semi-circu|lar Chapels in the upper Angles. The Churches hereabouts called <HI>Min&s;ters,</HI> as <HI>Wimburn-min&s;ter,</HI> in the neighbouring County of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> were built by the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, as &s;oon as they became Chri&s;tian. At the We&s;t-end is the Piece of an old Wall, pro|bably belonging to the Nunnery built here by King <HI>Edgar.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="261">Returning to <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> we &s;truck up North-we&s;t and came to <HI>Stokebridge,</HI> a poor &s;orry Borough Town, noted for its Corruption in electing Members of Par|liament, and being a great Thorough-fare on the South-we&s;tern Road: it has however a great many good Inns, and as well provided as any on that Road, tho' it has no Market.</P>
<P>The ingenious Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> once repre&s;ented this Town in Parliament; and tho' he was power|fully oppo&s;ed, yet carried his Election by a Stra|tagem, which made all the Women of his Side: Hav|ing made a great Entertainment for the Burge&s;&s;es and their Wives, and after having been very free and facetious among them, he took up a large Ap|ple, and &s;tuck it full of Guineas, and declared it the Prize of that Man, who&s;e Wife &s;hould be fir&s;t brought to-bed after that Day Nine Months. This occa&s;ioned a great deal of Mirth, and what with the Entertainment, and with the Hopes of getting the Prize, the good Women prevailed on their Hu&s;|bands to vote for Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> whom they to this Day commemorate; and, as it is &s;aid, once made a &s;trong Pu&s;h to get a &s;tanding Order of the Corpora|tion made, that no Man &s;hould be received as a Can|didate for that Borough, who did not offer him&s;elf upon the &s;ame Terms.</P>

It is very healthy and plea&s;antly &s;ituated ju&s;t on the Borders of tho&s;e Downs, which are commonly, tho' not properly called <HI>Sali&s;bury-plain.</HI> Near this Town is a Village called <HI>Weyhill,</HI> where the open Down Country begins; and here upon the&s;e Downs

<P>From <HI>Andover</HI> we bent our Way towards <HI>Wilt|&s;hire,</HI> by <HI>Quarley-hills,</HI> on the We&s;t-&s;ide of which are the Remains of a great Fortification, con&s;i&s;ting of two outward Trenches, and other Works of great Strength; and then entering that County, and leaving <HI>Lugger&s;hall</HI> (a &s;mall Hamlet-town, noted only for having been formerly the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Jeoffrey Fitzpiers,</HI> on the North of us, we came to <HI>Ambre&s;bury,</HI> a very antient Town, pretty large, &s;tanding on the River <HI>Avon,</HI> and having &s;everal good Inns, but its Market is much decayed, and almo&s;t di&s;continued.

<P>The treacherous <HI>Saxon</HI> &s;av'd only the King, whom he obliged to give him near a Third of his King|dom Ea&s;tward, before he would &s;et him at Liberty.</P>
<P>The Mona&s;tery at <HI>Ambre&s;bury</HI> was converted into a Nunnery, and <HI>Eleanor,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> III.'s Queen retir'd and dy'd here; who&s;e Example induced the Prince&s;s <HI>Mary,</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI>'s &s;econd Daughter, and Thirteen Noblemens Daughters, to take the Veil together in this Hou&s;e.</P>

<PB N="257" REF="264">
it, and yet is not the heavie&s;t Stone neither. Judge then what a &s;tupendous Labour it was to bring toge|ther, &s;o many Miles, &s;uch a Number as were u&s;ed here; and this has induced many incon&s;iderate Peo|ple to imagine, that the Founders had an Art of making Stone, which has been lo&s;t for &s;o many Ages.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Name is <HI>Saxon,</HI> tho' the Work is be|yond all Compari&s;on older, &s;ignifying a hanging Rod or Pole, <HI>i. e.</HI> a Gallows, from the hanging Parts, Architraves, or rather Impo&s;ts; and pendulous Rocks are &s;till in <HI>York&s;hire</HI> called <HI>Henges.</HI> But the an|tient Name was mo&s;t probably the <HI>Ambres,</HI> for which our learned Author, to whom we refer, gives very &s;atisfactory Rea&s;ons; and hence the adjacent Town of <HI>Ambre&s;bury,</HI> which I have taken Notice of, has its Name.</P>
<P><HI>Stone-henge</HI> &s;tands not upon the Summit of a Hill, but near it, however: at half a Mile Di&s;tance the Appearance is awful; but as you come up the Ave|nue, in the North-ea&s;t of it, which Side is mo&s;t perfect, the Greatne&s;s of its Contour fills the Eye in an a&s;toni&s;hing manner. It is inclo&s;ed in a circular Ditch, which having pa&s;&s;ed, we a&s;cend Thirty-five Yards before we come at the Work. The Stones are chi&s;&s;ell'd, and far from rude, tho' not cut to that Preci&s;ene&s;s as the Ruins in <HI>Old Rome,</HI> and the In|&s;ide of them had more Pains taken with them then the Out&s;ide; for &s;o, as our Author ob&s;erves, the polite Architects of the Ea&s;tern World were wont to do; not like our <HI>London</HI> Builders, who carve every Moulding, and croud every Ornament they borrow from Books, on the Out&s;ide of the publick Structures, that they may the more commodiou&s;ly gather the Du&s;t and Smoke.</P>
<P>When you enter the Building, whether on Foot or Hor&s;eback, and ca&s;t your Eyes around upon the yawning Ruins, you are &s;truck into an ec&s;tatick Re|verie,
<PB N="258" REF="265">
which no one can de&s;cribe, and they only can be &s;en&s;ible of, who feel it. Other Buildings fall by piece-meal, but here a &s;ingle Stone is a Ruin. Yet is there as much undemoli&s;h'd as enables us &s;uf|ficiently to recover its Form when in its mo&s;t perfect State. When we advance farther, the dark Part of the ponderous Impo&s;ts over our Heads, the Cha&s;ms of Sky between the Jambs of the Cell, the odd Con&s;tru|ction of the Whole, and the Greatne&s;s of every Part, &s;urpri&s;es. If you look upon the perfect Part, you fan&s;y intire Quarries mounted up into the Air; if upon the rude Havock below, you &s;ee, as it were, the Bowels of a Mountain turn'd in&s;ide out.</P>
<P>The whole Work, being of a circular Form, is about 108 Feet in Diameter, from out to out. The Intention of the Founders was this: the whole Circle was to con&s;i&s;t of Thirty Stones, each Stone to be <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Cubit is the old <HI>Hebrew, Phoenician,</HI> or <HI>Egyptian</HI> Cubit, and what the Founders of <HI>Stone-benge</HI> went by, and amounts to Twenty Inches Four-fifths <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mea&s;ure.</NOTE> Four Cubits broad, each Interval Two Cubits; Thirty times Four Cubits is twice Sixty: Thirty times Two Cubits is Sixty; &s;o that thrice Sixty Cubits completes a Circle, who&s;e Diameter is Sixty. A Stone being Four Cubits broad, and Two thick, is double the Interval, which is a Square of Two Cu|bits. Change the Places between the Stones and their Intervals, and it will make a good Ground-plot for a circular Portico of <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Work. Tho' the&s;e Bodies of Stone, which are in the Nature of Impo&s;ts or Cornices, never had, or were intended to have, any Mouldings upon them, like <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Works, they are wrought perfectly plain, and &s;uitable to the Stones that &s;upport them; and the Chi&s;&s;eling of the upright Stones is only above Ground; for the Four or Five Feet in Length below Ground, is left in the original natural Form. The upright Stones are made very judiciou&s;ly to dimini&s;h a little
<PB N="259" REF="266">
every way; &s;o that at-top they are but Three Cu|bits and a half broad, and &s;o much nearer as to &s;uf|fer their Impo&s;ts to meet a little over the Heads of the Uprights, both within-&s;ide and without; by which means the Uprights are le&s;s liable to fall or &s;werve.</P>
<P>It is to be fear'd &s;ome indi&s;creet People have been digging about the great Entrance, with ridiculous Hopes of finding Trea&s;ure, and &s;o have loo&s;en'd the chalky Foundation; for the upper Edge of the Im|po&s;t overhangs no le&s;s than Two Feet Seven Inches, which is very con&s;iderable in a Height of Eighteen. The whole Breadth at the Foundation is but Two Feet and an half; and this noble Front is now chiefly kept up by the Ma&s;onry of the Mortai&s;e, and Tendon of the Impo&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Contrivance of the Founders in making Mor|tai&s;es and Tenons between the upright Stones and the Impo&s;ts, is admirable; but &s;o contrary to any Practice of the <HI>Romans,</HI> that it alone over&s;ets their Claim to the Work. The&s;e Tenons and Mortaifes of this outer Circle are round, and fit one another very aptly. They are Ten Inches and one half in Diameter, and re&s;emble half an Egg, rather than an Hemi&s;phere, and &s;o effectually keep both Uprights and Impo&s;ts from Luxation, that they mu&s;t have been thrown down with great Difficulty and Labour. The whole Height of Upright and Impo&s;t is Ten Cubits and an half; the Upright, Nine; the Impo&s;t over the grand Entrance is in its middle Length Eleven Feet Ten Inches, and &s;o is larger than the re&s;t, and it is al&s;o a little broader, mea&s;uring on the In&s;ide.</P>
<P>Of the outer Circle of <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> which in its Perfection con&s;i&s;ted of Sixty Stones, Thirty Up|rights, and Thirty Impo&s;ts, there are Seventeen Uprights left &s;tanding, Eleven of which remain con|tinuous by the grand Entrance, Five Impo&s;ts upon them. One Upright at the Back of the Temple, leans upon a Stone of the inner Circle. There are
<PB N="260" REF="267">
Six more lying upon the Ground, whole or in Pieces, &s;o that Twenty-four out of Thirty are &s;till vi&s;ible at the Place. There is but one Impo&s;t more in its proper Place, and but Two lying upon the Ground; &s;o that Twenty-two are carry'd off. Hence our Author infers, this Temple was not defac'd when Chri&s;tianity prevailed; but that &s;ome rude Hands carried the Stones away for other U&s;es. So much for the larger Circle of Stones with Impo&s;ts.</P>
<P>As to the le&s;&s;er Circle, which never had any Im|po&s;ts, it is &s;omewhat more than Eight Feet from the In&s;ide of the outward one, and con&s;i&s;ts of Forty le&s;&s;er Stones, forming, with the outward Circles, as it were, a circular Portico, a mo&s;t beautiful Work, and of a pretty Effect; they are flat Parallelograms, as tho&s;e of the outer Circle; and their general and de&s;ign'd Proportion is Two Cubits, or Two and an half, as &s;uitable Stones were found. They are a Cubit thick, and Four and one half high, which is more than Seven Feet; this was their &s;tated Propor|tion, being every way the half of the upper Uprights. The&s;e Stones are of a harder Compo&s;ition than the re&s;t, as the better to re&s;i&s;t Violence, as they are le&s;&s;er, and they have &s;ufficient Fa&s;tenings in the Ground. There are but Nineteen of the Forty left; but Eleven of them are &s;tanding <HI>in &s;itu,</HI> Five in one Place contiguous, Three in another, Two in another.</P>
<P>The Walk between the&s;e Two Circles, which is 300 Feet in Circumference, is very noble, and very delightful.</P>
<P>The <HI>Adytum,</HI> or Cell, into which we may &s;up|po&s;e none but the upper Order of Druids were to enter, is compo&s;ed of certain Compages of Stones, which our Author calls <HI>Trilithons,</HI> becau&s;e made each of two upright Stones, with an Impo&s;t at top, and there are manife&s;tly Five of the&s;e remaining; Three of which are intire, Two are ruin'd, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, but the Stones remain <HI>in &s;itu.</HI> It is a magni|ficent
<PB N="261" REF="268">
Niche Twenty-&s;even Cubits long, and as much broad, mea&s;uring in the wide&s;t Place. The Stones that compo&s;e it, are really &s;tupendous; their Height, Breadth, and Thickne&s;s are enormous, and to &s;ee &s;o many of them placed together in a nice and critical Figure, with Exactne&s;s; to con&s;ider, as it were, not a Pillar of one Stone, but a whole Wall, a Side, an End of a Temple, of one Stone; to view them curiou&s;ly, create &s;uch a Motion in the Mind as Words cannot expre&s;s. One very remarkable Par|ticular in the Con&s;titution of this <HI>Adytum,</HI> has e&s;cap'd all Ob&s;ervers before our Author, which is this: as this Part is compo&s;ed of Trilithons &s;et two and two on each Side, and one right before, they ri&s;e in Height and Beauty of the Stones, from the lower End of the <HI>Adytum</HI> to the upper End. That is, the two hithermo&s;t Trilithons corre&s;ponding, or tho&s;e next the grand Entrance, on the Right-hand, and on the Left, are exceeded in Height by the Two next in Order; and tho&s;e are exceeded by that be|hind the Altar, in the upper End of this Choir; and their Heights re&s;pectively are Thirteen Cubits, Four|teen Cubits, Fifteen Cubits.</P>
<P>The Impo&s;ts of the&s;e are all of the &s;ame Height, and Ten Cubits may be &s;uppo&s;ed their medium Mea|&s;ure in Length. The Artifice of the Tenons and Mortai&s;es of the&s;e Trilithons and their Impo&s;ts, what Conformity they bear to that of the outer Circle, is exceedingly pretty, every thing being done very geometrically, and as would be&s;t an&s;wer every Purpo&s;e from plain and &s;imple Principles; and 'tis wonderful, that in the Management of &s;uch prodi|gious Stones as the&s;e are, fix'd in the Ground, and ramm'd in like Po&s;ts, there is not more Variation in the Height, Di&s;tance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Of the&s;e greater Stones of the <HI>Adytum,</HI> as is ob|&s;erved before, there are none wanting, being all on the Spot, Ten Uprights, and Five Cornices. The
<PB N="262" REF="269">
Trilithon fir&s;t on the Left-hand is intire <HI>in &s;itu,</HI> but va&s;t|ly decay'd, e&s;pecially the Cornice, in which &s;uch deep Holes are corroded, that in &s;ome Places the Daws make their Ne&s;ts in them. The next Trilithon on the Left is intire, compo&s;ed of three mo&s;t beautiful Stones. The Cornice, happening to be of a very du|rable <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Marble, has not been much impair'd by the Weather. Our Author took a Walk on the Top of it, but thought it a frightful Situation. The Trilithon of the upper End was an extraordinary Beauty; but probably, thro' the Indi&s;cretion of &s;ome body digging between them and the Altar, the noble Impo&s;t is di&s;lodg'd from its airy Seat, and fallen upon the Altar, where its huge Bulk lies unfractur'd. The Two Uprights that &s;upported it, are the mo&s;t delicate Stones of the whole Work. They were, our Author thinks, above Thirty Feet long, and well chi&s;&s;ell'd, finely taper'd and proportion'd in their Dimen&s;ions. That Southward is broken in two, lying upon the Altar. The other &s;till &s;tands intire; but leans upon one of the Stones of the inward Oval; the Root-end, or unhewn Part of both, is rai&s;ed &s;ome|what above Ground. The Trilithon towards the We&s;t is intire, except that &s;ome of the End of the Impo&s;t is fallen clean off, and all the upper Edge is very much dimini&s;h'd by time. The la&s;t Trilithon, on the Right-hand of the Entrance into the <HI>Adytum,</HI> has &s;uffer'd much. The outer Upright, being the Jamb of the Entrance, is &s;till &s;tanding; the other Upright and Impo&s;t are both fallen forwards into the Adytum, and broke each into Three Pieces, as &s;up|po&s;ed, from digging near it. That which is &s;tand|ing has a Cavity in it, which Two or Three Per&s;ons may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">it in warm from the Weather.</P>
<P><HI>Stone-henge</HI> is compo&s;ed of Two Circles and Two Ovals, re&s;pectively concentrick. The Stones that form the&s;e Ovals ri&s;e in Height as nearer the upper End of the <HI>Adytum</HI>; and their mediate Mea&s;ure is
<PB N="263" REF="270">
Four Cubits and Four Palms. They are of a much harder Kind than the larger Stones in the le&s;&s;er Cir|cle; the Founders no doubt intending, that their le&s;&s;er Bulk &s;hould be compen&s;ated by Solidity. Of the&s;e there are only Six remaining upright; the Stumps of Two are left on the South-&s;ide by the Altar; one lies behind the Altar dug up, or thrown down, by the Fall of the Upright there. One or Two were pro|bably thrown down by the Fall of the Upright of the fir&s;t Trilithon on the Right-hand; a Stump of an|other remains by the Upright there &s;till &s;tanding.</P>
<P>The whole Number of Stones may be thus com|puted. The great Oval con&s;i&s;ts of Ten Uprights; the inner with the Altar of Twenty; the great Cir|cle of Thirty; the inner of Forty, which are One hundred upright Stones; Five Impo&s;ts of the great Oval; Thirty of the great Circle; the Two Stones on the Bank of the Area; the Stone lying within the Entrance of the Area, and that &s;tanding without; there &s;eems to be another lying on the Ground, by the <HI>Vallum</HI> of the Court, directly oppo&s;ite to the Entrance of the Avenue: all added together make ju&s;t One hundred and forty Stones, the Number of which <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> a whole Temple, is compo&s;ed. Behold the Solution of the mighty Problem! the magical Spell, which has &s;o long perplex'd the Vulgar, is broken! They think it an ominous thing to count the true Number of the Stones, and whoever does &s;o &s;hall <HI>certainly</HI> die after it!</P>
<P>As to the Altar, it is laid toward the upper End of the <HI>Adytum,</HI> at pre&s;ent flat on the Ground, and &s;queez'd into it, as it were, by the Weight of the Ruins upon it. 'Tis a kind of blue coar&s;e Marble, &s;uch as comes from <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> and laid upon Tombs in our Churches and Church-yards. Our Author believes its Breadth is Two Cubits Three Palms, and that its fir&s;t intended Length was Ten Cubits, equal to the Breadth of the Trilithon, before which it lies.
<PB N="264" REF="271">
But it is very difficult to come at its true Length. 'Tis Twenty Inches thick, a ju&s;t Cubit, and has been &s;quar'd. It lies between the two Centres, that of the Compa&s;&s;es and that of the String; leaving a con|venient Space quite round it, no doubt as much as was nece&s;&s;ary for this Mini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The Heads of Oxen, Deer, and other Bea&s;ts have been found upon digging in and about <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> undoubted Reliques of Sacrifices, together with Wood-a&s;hes. Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> &s;ays, Mens Bones have been found hereabouts; he means in the adjacent Bar|rows, and &s;uch our Author &s;aw thrown out by the Rabbets, which have been brought hither of late Years, and by their burrowing threaten the&s;e noble Ruins; as the greedy Plough more and more invades the neigh|bouring Plain.</P>
<P>But eternally, as he ob&s;erves, is to be lamented the Lo&s;s of that Tablet of Tin, which was found at this Place in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in&s;cribed with many Letters; but in &s;o &s;trange a Character, that neither Sir <HI>Thomas Elliot,</HI> a learned Antiquary, nor Mr. <HI>Lilly,</HI> Fir&s;t High Ma&s;ter of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s School, could make any thing out of; and which, no doubt, was a Memorial of the Founders, written by the Druids; and had it been pre&s;erv'd till now, would have been an invaluable Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>In the Year 1635, as they were plowing by the Barrows about <HI>Normanton-Ditch,</HI> they found &s;o large a Quantity of excellent Pewter, as, at a low Price, they &s;old for Five Pounds. There are &s;everal of the&s;e Ditches, being very narrow, which run acro&s;s the Downs, which perhaps are Boundaries of Hun|dreds, Pari&s;hes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e Pewter Plates might very po&s;&s;ibly have been Tablets, with In&s;criptions; but falling into &s;uch rude Hands, they could no more di&s;cern the Writing, than interpret it. No doubt, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Stukeley,</HI> this was &s;ome of the old <HI>Briti&s;h Stan|num,</HI> which the <HI>Tyrian Hercules,</HI> &s;urnam'd <HI>Melcar|thus,</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="272">
fir&s;t brought <HI>ex Ca&s;&s;iteride In&s;ula,</HI> or <HI>Britain:</HI> Which <HI>Hercules</HI> lived in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Time, or &s;oon after.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Webb</HI> tells us, the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> dug about <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> perhaps much to the Prejudice of the Work. Mr. <HI>Webb</HI> al&s;o did the like, and found what he imagined was the Corner of a <HI>Thuribulum.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hayward,</HI> late Owner of <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> like|wi&s;e dug about it, and found Heads of Oxen, and other Bea&s;ts Bones, and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> him&s;elf, in 1723, dug on the In&s;ide of the Altar, about the middle, Four Feet along the Edge of the Stone, Six Feet forward toward the mid|dle of the <HI>Adytum</HI>: at a Foot deep he came to the &s;olid Chalk, mix'd with Flints, which had never been &s;tirr'd. The Altar was exactly a Cubit-thick, <HI>i. e.</HI> Twenty Inches Four-fifths, but broken in Two or Three Pieces by the ponderous Ma&s;&s;es of the Impo&s;ts, and one upright Stone of that Trilithon, which &s;tood at the upper End of the <HI>Adytum,</HI> being fallen upon it. Hence appears the Commodiou&s;ne&s;s of the Founda|tion for this huge Work! They dug Holes in the &s;o|lid Chalk, which would of it&s;elf keep up the Stones as firm as if a Wall was built round them; and no doubt but they ramm'd up the Inter&s;tices with Flints. But he &s;ays, he had too much Regard to the Work, to dig any-where near the Stones. He took up an Ox's Tooth above Ground, without the <HI>Adytum,</HI> on the Right-hand of the lowermo&s;t Trilithon Northward.</P>
<P>The Time our Author a&s;&s;igns for the building of <HI>Stone-henge</HI> is not long after <HI>Camby&s;es</HI>'s Inva&s;ion of <HI>Egypt</HI>; when he committed &s;uch horrid Outrages there, and made &s;uch di&s;mal Havock with the Prie&s;ts and Inhabitants in general, that they di&s;per&s;ed them|&s;elves to all the Parts of the World; &s;ome as far as the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI>; and &s;ome, it is not que&s;tioned, as far We&s;tward, into <HI>Britain,</HI> and introduced &s;ome of their Learning, Arts and Religion among the <HI>Druids,</HI>
<PB N="266" REF="273">
and perhaps had a Hand in this very Work, the only one where the Stones are chi&s;&s;ell'd; all other Works of theirs being of rude Stones, untouch'd of the Tool, exactly after the <HI>Patriarchal</HI> and <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Mode, and therefore older than this; and this Conjecture is the more probable, becau&s;e, at the time mention'd, the <HI>Phoenician</HI> Trade was at its Height, which afforded a readier Conveyance hither. This was before the &s;e|cond Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was built; before the <HI>Grecians</HI> had any Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>For farther Particulars of this &s;tupendous Work, and other curious Matters relating and adjacent to it (&s;uch as its Antiquity before the Time of the <HI>Belgae,</HI> the <HI>Romans,</HI> the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI>; of the <HI>Wan&s;|dike</HI>; of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI>'s Camp at <HI>Ambresbury</HI>; the Intro|duction of the <HI>Druids</HI> into <HI>Britain,</HI> which he puts about <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Time; its antient Name, [the <HI>Am|bres</HI>]; the Water Va&s;es of <HI>Stone-henge</HI>; the Avenue to it; the <HI>Cur&s;us</HI>); we mu&s;t refer our Readers to the Work it&s;elf, having already exceeded the narrow Bounds to which the Nature of our De&s;ign confines us. But this we may add, that doubtle&s;s they had &s;ome Method in former Days, in foreign Countries, as well as here, to move heavier Weights than we now find practicable. How el&s;e did <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Work|men build the Battlement, or additional Wall, to &s;upport the Precipice of <HI>Mount-Moriah,</HI> on which the Temple was erected; which was all built of <HI>Pa|rian</HI> Marble, each Stone being Forty Cubits long, Fourteen broad, and Eight Cubits thick. And &s;o much for this celebrated Temple of <HI>Stone-henge.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall now proceed to give &s;ome Account of the famous Barrows on the&s;e Downs, and we &s;hall borrow from the &s;ame learned Author, the following curious Particulars relating to them.</P>
<P>The Tops of all the Hills, or rather ea&s;y Eleva|tions, round <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> are in a manner cover'd over with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Barrows, which make an agreeable
<PB N="267" REF="274">
Appearance, adorning the bare Downs with their Figures. This Ring of Barrows, however, reaches no farther, than till you lo&s;e Sight of the Temple, as we now make no doubt to call <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> or thereabouts. Many, from the great Number of the&s;e &s;epulchral <HI>Tumuli</HI> here, injudiciou&s;ly conclude, that there have been great Battles upon the Plain, and that the Slain are buried there; but they are really no other than Family Burying-places &s;et near this Temple, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on as we bury in Church-yards, and con&s;ecrated Ground.</P>
<P>We may readily count Fifty at a time in Sight from the Place, e&s;pecially in the Evening, when the &s;loping Rays of the Sun &s;hine on the Ground be|yond them. They are mo&s;t of them of a very ele|gant Bell-like Form, and done with great Nicety; in general they are always upon elevated Ground, and in Sight of the Temple, as we have &s;aid; for they all regard it, and are a&s;&s;uredly the &s;ingle Sepulchres of Kings and great Per&s;onages buried, during a con|&s;iderable Space of Time, and in Peace. There are many Groups of them together, as if Family Burial-places; and the Variety in them &s;eems to indicate &s;ome Pre-eminence in the Per&s;ons interred. Mo&s;t of them have little Ditches around; in many is a circular Ditch, 60 Cubits in Diameter, with a very &s;mall <HI>Tumulus</HI> in the Centre. Sixty, or even 100 Cubits, is a very common Diameter in the large Barrows. Often they are &s;et in Rows, and equi|di&s;tant, &s;o as to produce a regular and pretty Ap|pearance, and with &s;ome particular Regard to the Parts of the Temple, the Avenues, or the <HI>Cur&s;us.</HI> Upon every Range of Hills, quite round <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> are &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Groups of Barrows for &s;ome Miles; and even that nam'd <HI>King-barrow,</HI> by Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s Park Wall at <HI>Wilton,</HI> which our Author calls the
<PB N="268" REF="275">
Tomb of <HI>Carvilius,</HI> is &s;et within View of <HI>Stone-henge.</HI></P>
<P>In 1722, the late Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI> opened a Bar|row, in order to find the Po&s;ition of the Body ob|&s;erved in tho&s;e early Days. He pitched upon one of the double Barrows, where two are inclo&s;ed in one Ditch. He made a Section from the Top to the Bottom, an intire Segment from Centre to Circum|ference. The Compo&s;ition was good Earth quite thro', except a Coat of Chalk of about Two Feet thick, covering it quite over, under the Turf. Hence it appears, that the Method of making the&s;e Barrows, was to dig up the Turf for a great Space round, till the Barrow was brought to its intended Bulk; then with the Chalk dug out of the inviron|ing Ditch, they powder'd it all over. And the No|tion of Sanctity annexed to them, forbad People trampling on them till perfectly &s;ettled and turfed over; whence the Neatne&s;s of their Form to this Day. At the Top or Centre of this Barrow, not above Three Feet under the Surface, my Lord found the Skeleton of the Interred, perfect, of a rea&s;on|able Size, the Head lying Northward towards <HI>Stone-henge.</HI></P>
<P>The Year following, by my Lord's Order, Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> began upon another double Barrow. He began upon the le&s;&s;er, and made a large Cut on the Top from Ea&s;t to We&s;t. After the Turf, he came to the Layer of Chalk, as before, then fine Garden Mould. About Three Feet below the Surface, a Layer of Flints humouring the Convexity of the Barrow, which are gathered from the Surface of the Downs in &s;ome Places, e&s;pecially where it has been ploughed. This being about a Foot thick, re&s;ted on a Layer of &s;oft Mould another Foot; in which was inclo&s;ed an Urn full of Bones. The Urn was of unbaked Clay, of a dark reddi&s;h Colour; crumbled into pieces. It had been rudely wrought with &s;mall
<PB N="269" REF="276">
Mouldings round the Verge, and other circular Chanels on the Out&s;ide, with &s;everal Indentions between, made with a pointed Tool. The Bones had been burnt, and crouded all together in a little Heap, not &s;o much as a Hat-crown would contain; the Collar-bone, and one &s;ide of the Under-jaw remaining very intire. It appears to have been a Girl of about Fourteen Years old, by their Bulk, and the great Quantity of Female Ornaments mixed with the Bones; as great Numbers of gla&s;s Beads of all Sorts, and of divers Colours, mo&s;t yellow, one black; many &s;ingle, many in long Pieces, notched between, &s;o as to re&s;emble a String of Beads, and the&s;e were generally of a blue Colour. There were many of Amber, of all Shapes and Sizes, flat Squares, long Squares, round, oblong, little and great; like|wi&s;e many of Earth, of different Shapes, Magni|tude and Colour; &s;ome little and white, many large and flatti&s;h, like a Button, others like a Pully; but all had Holes to run a String thro', either thro' their Diameter or Sides: Many of the Button Sort &s;eem'd to have been covered with Metal, there being a Rim worked in them, wherein to turn the Edge of the Covering. One of the&s;e was covered with a thin Film of pure Gold. The&s;e were the young Lady's Ornaments, and had all undergone Fire, &s;o that what would ea&s;ily con&s;ume, fell to-pieces as &s;oon as handled; much of the Amber burnt half thro': this Per&s;on was a Heroine; for we found the Head of her Javelin in Bra&s;s. At Bottom are two Holes for the Pin that fa&s;tened it to the Staff; be&s;ides, there was a &s;harp Bodkin, round at one End, &s;quare at the other, where it went into the Handle. Our Author pre&s;erved whatever is permanent of the&s;e Trinkets; but recompos'd the A&s;hes of the illu&s;trious Defunct, and covered them with Earth, leaving vi&s;ible Marks at Top of the Barrow having been open'd (to di&s;&s;uade any other
<PB N="270" REF="277">
from again di&s;turbing them): and this was his Practice in all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>He then opened the next Barrow to it, inclo&s;ed in the &s;ame Ditch, which he &s;uppo&s;ed the Hu&s;band or Father of this Lady. At 14 Inches deep, the Mould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">ng mixed with Chalk, he came to the intire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">ton of a Man, the Skull and all the Bones <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="5+ letters">ingly rotten and peri&s;hed, thro' Length of Time: tho' this was a Barrow of the late&s;t Sort, as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="5+ letters">ctured. The Body lay North and South, the Head to the North, as that Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">ed.</P>
<P>Next he went We&s;tward to a Group of Barrows, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Stone-henge</HI> bears Ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t. Here is a large Barrow ditch'd about, but of an antient Make. On that Side next <HI>Stone-henge</HI> are Ten le&s;&s;er, &s;mall, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> were, crouded together. South of the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Barrow, larger than tho&s;e of the Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">up, but not equalling the fir&s;t: it would &s;eem, that a Man and his Wife were buried in the Two larger, and that the re&s;t were of their Children or Dependents. One of the &s;mall ones, 20 Cubits in Diameter, he cut thro', with a Pit Nine Feet in Diameter, to the Surface of the natural Chalk, in the Centre of the Barrow, where was a little Hole cut. A Child's Body, as it &s;eems, had been burnt here, and covered up in that Hole; but thro' Length of Time con&s;umed. From Three Feet deep he found much Wood-a&s;hes, &s;oft, and black as Ink, &s;ome little Bits of an Urn, and black and red Earth very rotten; &s;ome &s;mall Lumps of Earth red as Vermilion; &s;ome Flints burnt thro'; toward the Bottom, a great Quantity of A&s;hes, and burnt Bones. From this Place he counted 128 Barrows in Sight.</P>
<P>Going from hence more Southerly, is a circular di&s;h-like Cavity, 60 Cubits in Diameter, dug in the Chalk, like a Barrow rever&s;ed. 'Tis near a great Bar|row, the lea&s;t of the South-we&s;tern Group. This
<PB N="271" REF="278">
Cavity is Seven Feet deep in the Middle, extremely well turn'd; and out of it, no doubt, the adjacent Barrow is dug. The U&s;e of it &s;eems to have been a Place for &s;acrificing and fea&s;ting in Memory of the Dead, as was the antient Cu&s;tom. 'Tis all over|grown with that pretty Shrub <HI>Erica Vulgaris,</HI> then in Flower, and &s;melling like Honey. He made a large cro&s;s Section in its Centre, upon the Cardinal Points, and found nothing but a Bit of red earthen Pot.</P>
<P>He then dug up one of tho&s;e he calls <HI>Druids</HI> Barrows, a &s;mall <HI>Tumulus,</HI> inclo&s;ed in a large circular Ditch. <HI>Stone-henge</HI> bears hence North-ea&s;t. He made a cro&s;s Section Ten Feet each way, Three Feet broad over its Centre upon the Cardinal Points: At length he found a &s;quari&s;h Hole cut in the &s;olid Chalk, in the Centre of the <HI>Tumulus</HI>; it was Three Feet and an half, <HI>i. e.</HI> Two Cubits long, and near Two Feet broad, <HI>i. e.</HI> One Cubit, pointing to <HI>Stone-henge</HI> directly. It was a Cubit and an half deep from the Surface. This was the <HI>Domus exilis Plutonia,</HI> covered with artifi|cial Earth, not above a Foot thick from the Surface. In this little Grave he found all the burnt Bones of a Man, but no Signs of an Urn. The Bank of the circular Ditch is on the Out<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ide, and is 12 Cubits broad. The Ditch is Six Cubits broad, (the <HI>Druid</HI>'s Staff); the Area is 70 Cubits in Diameter. The Whole 100.</P>
<P>He opened another of the&s;e of like Dimen&s;ions, next to that Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI> fir&s;t opened, South of <HI>Stone-henge</HI>; and found a burnt Body in a Hole in the Chalk, as before.</P>
<P>In &s;ome other Barrows he opened, were found large burnt Bones of Hor&s;es and Dogs, along with human; al&s;o of other Animals, as &s;eem'd of Fowl, Hares, Boars, Deer, Goats, or the like; and in a great and very flat old-fa&s;hioned Barrow, We&s;t from <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> among &s;uch Matters, he found Bits of
<PB N="272" REF="279">
red and blue Marble, Chippings of the Stones of the Temple, &s;o that probably the Interred was one of the Builders. <HI>Homer</HI> tells of <HI>Achilles</HI> &s;laying Hor&s;es and Dogs at the Funeral of his Friend <HI>Patroclus.</HI></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI> told the Doctor of a Bra&s;s Sword dug up in a Barrow here, which was &s;ent to <HI>Oxford.</HI> In that very old Barrow near <HI>Little Ambre&s;bury,</HI> was found a very large Bra&s;s Weapon of 20 Pounds Weight, like a Pole-ax, &s;aid to be given to Colonel <HI>Wyndham.</HI> In the great long Barrow farthe&s;t North from <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> which our Author &s;uppo&s;es to be an <HI>Archdruid's,</HI> was found one of tho&s;e Bra&s;s In&s;tru|ments called <HI>Celts,</HI> which he thinks belong'd to the <HI>Druids,</HI> wherewith they cut off the Mi&s;leto. Mr. <HI>Stallard</HI> of <HI>Ambre&s;bury</HI> gave it to Lord <HI>Bur|lington,</HI> now in Sir <HI>Hans Sloane</HI>'s Cabinet, 13 Inches long. They dug a Cell in a Barrow Ea&s;t of <HI>Ambre&s;|bury,</HI> and it was inhabited for &s;ome time. There they &s;aw all the Bones of a Hor&s;e. We find evidently, adds the Doctor, the&s;e antient Nations had the Cu&s;tom of burning their dead Bodies, probably before the Name of <HI>Rome.</HI> So <HI>Lacrymatories</HI> we read of in Scripture, antienter than <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Times. <HI>P&s;alm</HI> lvi.8.</P>
<P><HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> Plains are certainly the mo&s;t charming that can any-where be &s;een. The numerous Flocks of Sheep all around, which way &s;oever we turn, are a fine Sight; 'tis ordinary for the&s;e Flocks to con|tain from 3000 to 5000 each; and &s;everal private Farmers hereabouts have Two or Three &s;uch Flocks.</P>
<P>But 'tis more remarkable &s;till, how a great Part of the&s;e Downs comes, by a new Method of Hu&s;bandry, not only to be made arable, but to bear plentiful Crops of Wheat, tho' never known to our Ance&s;tors to be capable of any &s;uch Thing; nay, they would probably have laughed at any one that had gone about to plough up the wild Downs and Hills, which they thought only fit for Sheep-walks; but Experi|ence
<PB N="273" REF="280">
has made the pre&s;ent Age wi&s;er, and more &s;kilful in Hu&s;bandry; for by only folding the Sheep upon tho&s;e Lands, after they are turn'd up with the Plough, (which generally goes within Three or Four Inches of the &s;olid Rock of Chalk) they become abundantly fruitful, and bear very good Wheat, as well as Rye and Barley. I &s;hall &s;ay more of this, when I come to &s;peak of the &s;ame Practice farther in the Country.</P>
<P>This plain open Country continues in Length from <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> 25 Miles, from thence to <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> 22 Miles, thence to <HI>Weymouth</HI> &s;ix Miles, &s;o that they lie near 50 Miles in Length and Breadth; they reach al&s;o in &s;ome Places fron 35 to 40 Miles: Tho&s;e who would make any practicable Gue&s;s at the Number of Sheep which u&s;ually feed on the&s;e Downs, may take it from a Calculation made, as I was told, at <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> that there were 600,000 Sheep fed within the Circumference of Six Miles around that Town.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed this open plain Country, we &s;aw the Ruins of a great many old <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Camps, and other Remains of the antient Inhabitants of this Kingdom, and of their Wars, Battles, Entrench|ments, Encampments, Buildings, and other Forti|fications, which are indeed very agreeable to a Tra|veller, that has read the Hi&s;tory of the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Old Sarum,</HI> which is the next Place we come to, is as remarkable as any of the&s;e, where there is a double Entrenchment, with a deep Graff, or Ditch, to either of them. 'Tis &s;aid it was a <HI>Roman</HI> Station, and the antient <HI>Sorbiodunum.</HI> It was de&s;erted in King <HI>Henry</HI> III.'s Time, for want of Water, when the Inhabitants founded <HI>New Sarum.</HI> The old City is of an orbicular Form, erected on one of the mo&s;t elegant De&s;igns imaginable. It was, fir&s;t, a Fortre&s;s of the antient <HI>Britons.</HI> The Pro&s;pect of this Place is at pre&s;ent very augu&s;t, and would have afforded us
<PB N="274" REF="281">
a mo&s;t noble Sight, when in Perfection. In the Angle to the North-we&s;t &s;tood the Cathedral, and Epi&s;copal Palace. The City fills up the Summit of an high and &s;teep Hill, near the Bottom of which runs the River <HI>Avon.</HI> Here Synods and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Par|liaments have formerly been held; and hither the States of the Kingdom were &s;ummoned to &s;wear Fealty to <HI>William</HI> I. In this City was the Palace of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, and of the <HI>Roman</HI> Em|perors. Near it is one Farm-hou&s;e, and that is all which is left of this antient City: yet this is called the Borough of <HI>Old Sarum,</HI> and &s;ends Two Mem|bers to Parliament, who are cho&s;en by the Proprietors of certain Lands. <HI>Whom</HI> tho&s;e Members can ju&s;tly &s;ay <HI>they repre&s;ent,</HI> would however be hard for them to an&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> is a large, well-built, and plea&s;ant City; and the Founders of it &s;eemed to have run from one Extreme to another; for as the old City wanted Water, this has rather too much, the Water run|ning thro' the Middle of every Street, which, I think, does not add to the Beauty of the Town, but ju&s;t the contrary; for it keeps the Streets always dirty, full of Wet and Filth, and Weeds, even in the Middle of Summer.</P>
<P>The City lies at the Confluence of Two Rivers, the <HI>Avon,</HI> and the <HI>Willy,</HI> each of them &s;ingly a con|&s;iderable River, but very large, when joined to|gether; and yet much larger, when they receive the <HI>Nadder,</HI> a third River, which joins them near <HI>Cla|rendon</HI> Park about Three Miles below the City; when, with a deep Chanel, and a Current le&s;s rapid, they run down to <HI>Chri&s;t-church,</HI> where they empty them&s;elves into the Sea. From that Town upwards, to within Two Miles of <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> they are made navigable; but the Strength of the Stream would not permit to make them &s;o up to the City.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="282"><HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> and all the County of <HI>Wilts,</HI> are full of a great Variety of Manufactures; and tho&s;e too of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in <HI>England</HI>; as the Cloath|ing Trade, and that of Flanels, Druggets, and al&s;o &s;everal other Sorts of Manufactures, of which in their Place.</P>
<P><HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> has, in particular, Two remarkable Ma|nufactures that flouri&s;h in it, which employ the Poor all around; namely, fine Flanels, and Long Cloths for the <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade, called <HI>Sali&s;bury Whites.</HI></P>
<P>The Clo&s;e adjacent to the Cathedral, in which live the Canons and Prebendaries, is &s;o large and well-built, that it looks like a fine City of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is famous for the Height of its Spire, which is without Exception the highe&s;t and the hand&s;ome&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> being from the Ground 410 Feet, and yet the Walls &s;o exceeding thin, that at the Upper-part of the Spire, upon a View made by the late Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren,</HI> the Wall was found to be le&s;s than five Inches thick; upon which a Con&s;ultation was had, whether the Spire, or at lea&s;t the Upper-part of it, &s;hould be taken down, it being &s;uppo&s;ed to have received &s;ome Damage by the great Storm in the Year 1703; but it was re&s;olved in the Negative, and Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> ordered it to be &s;trengthened with Bands of Iron Plates, which have effectually &s;ecured it; and I have heard &s;ome of the be&s;t Architects &s;ay, it is &s;tronger now than when it was fir&s;t built.</P>
<P>They tell us here long Stories of the great Art u&s;ed in laying the fir&s;t Foundation of this Church, the Ground being mar&s;hy and wet, occa&s;ioned by the Chanels of the Rivers; that it was laid upon Piles, according to &s;ome; and upon Woolpacks, according to others: But this is not to be believed by tho&s;e who know, that the whole Country is one Rock of Chalk, even from the Tops of the highe&s;t Hills, to the Bottom of the deepe&s;t Rivers. And the Foun|dation
<PB N="276" REF="283">
of Woolpacks is, no doubt, allegorical, and has re&s;pect to the Woollen Trade.</P>
<P>This Church was begun by Bi&s;hop <HI>Poore,</HI> continu'd by <HI>Robert Bingham,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> of <HI>York,</HI> and fini&s;hed by <HI>Giles de Brideport,</HI> Bi&s;hop of this See, all in the Space of 40 Years. The Model is after the Figure of a Cro&s;s; and it co&s;t an immen&s;e Sum of Money; but it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the In&s;ide of the Work is not an&s;werable, in the Decoration of Things, to the Workman&s;hip with|out. The Painting in the Choir is mean, and more like the ordinary Method of a common Drawing|room, or Tavern-painting, than that of a Church. The Carving is good, but there is very little of it, and it is rather a fine Church, than finely &s;et off.</P>
<P>But it now makes a better Appearance than it has done, having very lately been repaired by the Contri|butions of the Bi&s;hop and Prebendaries, &s;et on foot by Bi&s;hop <HI>Sherlock,</HI> who, it &s;eems, thought that the Dignitaries ought to &s;upport what &s;upported them; and that all they got by the Church was not de&s;igned merely to make or inrich their Families.</P>
<P>The ordinary Boa&s;t of this Building, in the fol|lowing Ver&s;es, mu&s;t not be omitted:
<Q><L><HI>As many Days as in One Year there be,</HI></L>
<L><HI>So many Windows in One Church we &s;ee;</HI></L>
<L><HI>As many Marble Pillars there appear,</HI></L>
<L><HI>As there are Hours throughout the fleeting Year;</HI></L>
<L><HI>As many Gates as Moons One Year do view:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Strange Tale to tell, yet not more &s;trange than true!</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Some of the Windows which e&s;caped the Fury of the Zealots of 1641, are well painted.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome very fine Monuments in this Church; particularly in that they call the <HI>Virgin Mary's Chapel,</HI> behind the Altar, is a noble Monu|ment for a late Duke and Duche&s;s of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> with
<PB N="277" REF="284">
their Pourtraits at full Length. The late Duche&s;s of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> of the <HI>Piercy</HI> Family, al&s;o her Daughter the Marchione&s;s of <HI>Caermarthen,</HI> and a &s;econd Son of her Grace, both by the pre&s;ent Duke, are like|wi&s;e interred here.</P>
<P>The Figure of one <HI>Bennet,</HI> who endeavoured to imitate our Saviour in Fa&s;ting Forty Days and Forty Nights, as is there repre&s;ented, carried his Point &s;o far, that being reduced to a Skeleton, he fell a Victim to his pre&s;umptuous and enthu&s;ia&s;tick Folly. The Bodies of the Bi&s;hops <HI>Jewell, Uvall, Che&s;t,</HI> were al&s;o interred here. Here is likewi&s;e a Monument to the beneficent Dr. <HI>Seth Ward,</HI> Bi&s;hop of this See, who founded (amid&s;t other Benefactions, which we &s;hall take notice of in <HI>Hertford&s;hire</HI>) a hand&s;ome College for the Widows of Ten Mini&s;ters, allowing to each 15<HI>l. per Annum</HI>; and which has been &s;ince obliged to Dr. <HI>Gilbert Burnet,</HI> Bi&s;hop of this See.</P>
<P>They &s;hew you al&s;o the Monument of the Lord <HI>Stourton,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> which is made remarkable by a particular Incident; as follows:</P>
<P>This Lord <HI>Stourton,</HI> being guilty of a Murder, which was aggravated with very bad Circum&s;tances, could not obtain the u&s;ual Grace of the Crown, to be beheaded; but Queen <HI>Mary</HI> po&s;itively ordered, that, like a common Malefactor, he &s;hould die at the Gallows. After he was executed, his Friends de&s;iring to have him bury'd at <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> the Bi&s;hop would not con&s;ent, that he &s;hould be buried in the Cathedral, unle&s;s, as a farther Mark of Infamy, they would &s;ubmit to this Condition, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That the &s;ilken Halter in which he was hanged, &s;hould be placed over his Grave in the Church, as a Monu|ment of his Crime; which was accordingly done, and there it is to be &s;een at this Day.</P>
<P>The putting this Halter up here, was not &s;o won|derful to me, as it was, that the Po&s;terity of that
<PB N="278" REF="285">
Lord, who remained in good Rank &s;ome Time after, &s;hould never prevail to have that Mark of Infamy taken from the Tomb of their Ance&s;tor.</P>
<P>The Cloi&s;ter is 160 Feet &s;quare, the inner Cioi&s;ter 30 Feet wide, with 10 Arches on each Side, the Top vaulted, and covered with Lead. Over the Ea&s;t Walk of the Cloi&s;ter, is a &s;pacious Library, but not over-well &s;tocked with Books. The Chapter-hou&s;e is Octagon, and is 150 Feet in Circumference; the Roof bearing all upon one &s;mall Marble Pillar in the Centre, which &s;eems &s;o feeble, that it is hardly to be imagined it can be any great Support to it, which makes it the more curious; and indeed, I believe, it is hardly to be matched in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Corporation of <HI>Sarum</HI> have lately purcha&s;ed a very fine Original Piece of Painting of her late Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> drawn by the celebrated <HI>Dahl,</HI> and have put it up in the Council-chamber of the City. This Picture formerly belonged to the Society of Gentlemen (all Members of Parliament) known by the Name of the <HI>October Club,</HI> and was &s;et up in the great Room belonging to the <HI>Bell</HI> (now <HI>Crown</HI>) Tavern in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> where they u&s;ed to meet till the Death of Queen <HI>Anne.</HI></P>
<P>In 1736-7, an Act pa&s;&s;ed for the better Repair|ing and Paving the Highways, Streets, and Water-cour&s;es within this City, and for Enlightening the Streets, Lanes, and Pa&s;&s;ages, and better regulating the Nightly Watch.</P>
<P>From hence directing my Cour&s;e to the Sea-&s;ide, in pur&s;uit of my fir&s;t De&s;ign of viewing the whole Coa&s;t of <HI>England</HI>; I left the great Road, and went down the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the River towards <HI>New-Fore&s;t</HI> and <HI>Lymington</HI>; and here I &s;aw the antient Hou&s;e and Seat of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> which gives Title to the Earl of that Name. This Place &s;hould be called <HI>Clorendon,</HI> from the memorable <HI>Roman</HI> Camp, half a Mile off the Park, near the <HI>Roman</HI> Road, made or repaired by
<PB N="279" REF="286">
<HI>Con&s;tantius Chlorus,</HI> Father of <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI> It is a beautiful Fortification, of a round Form, upon a dry chalky Hill. Within is a circular Ditch, &s;up|po&s;ed to be a le&s;s Sort of Camp for the Summer. The Park is a &s;weet and beautiful Spot. Here King <HI>John</HI> built a Palace, where &s;everal Parliaments have been held. Part of the Fabrick is &s;till left, tho' they have for many Years been pulling it down. The Meterials are chiefly Flint, and it was built upon the Side of an Hill, but no way fortified, tho' it took up much Ground. This Palace is called the <HI>Manor,</HI> and from it lies a &s;ubterraneous Pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>Queen's Manor.</HI> Between the Camp and the Park, was a <HI>Roman</HI> Road, from <HI>Sorbiodunum,</HI> or <HI>Old Sarum,</HI> to <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>But this being a large County, and full of memo|rable Branches of Antiquity, and modern Curio&s;ity, I made &s;everal little Excur&s;ions from this beautiful Spot, to view the Northern Parts of the County.</P>
<P>I have mentioned, that this County is generally a va&s;t continued Body of high chalky Hills, who&s;e Tops &s;pread them&s;elves into fruitful and plea&s;ant Downs and Plains, upon which great Flocks of Sheep are fed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the Reader is de&s;ired to ob&s;erve, the&s;e Hills and Plains are mo&s;t beautifully inter&s;ected, and cut thro', by the Cour&s;e of divers plea&s;ant and profitable Rivers; along, and near the Banks of which, there always is a Chain of fruitful Meadows, and rich Pa&s;tures, and tho&s;e inter&s;per&s;ed with a great many plea&s;ant Towns, Villages, and Hou&s;es, and among them many of con&s;iderable Magnitude; &s;o that, while you view the <HI>Downs,</HI> and think the Country wild and unin|habited, yet when you come to de&s;cend into the&s;e Vales, you are &s;urpri&s;ed with the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fertile Country in <HI>England.</HI></P>

of Three of which run thro' the Streets of the City; <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Nadder,</HI> the <HI>Willy,</HI> and the <HI>Avon.</HI> 1.

The <HI>Willy</HI> ri&s;es about <HI>Warmin&s;ter</HI>; runs by <HI>Yarnbury,</HI> a va&s;t <HI>Roman</HI> Camp (where &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI>'s Name; a great &s;emicircular Work at the Entrance; over-again&s;t which, on the other Side the <HI>Willy,</HI> is another Camp); then running by <HI>Orche&s;tra,</HI> re|markable for a Kind of Gra&s;s 25 Feet in Length, with which they fatten Hogs, it gives Name to <HI>Wilton,</HI> and forms the Canal before the Front of <HI>Wilton</HI> Hou&s;e; and then joining the <HI>Nadder,</HI> runs thro' the Gardens at the End of the Avenue. 3. The <HI>Avon</HI> ri&s;es from under a great Ridge of Hills, which divide <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> into North and South, adorn'd with the <HI>Wan&s;dike.</HI> It pa&s;&s;es Southward thro' a great Number of Villages to <HI>Ambre&s;bury.</HI></P>
<P>What is mo&s;t worth a Man of Curio&s;ity's &s;eeing in this County, is <HI>Wilton</HI> Hou&s;e. It is &s;ituated in a plea&s;ant Vale, having <HI>Wilton</HI> Town on one Side, and a &s;pacious Park on the other.</P>
<P>The Building was begun in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. The great Quadrangle was fini&s;hed in the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. and the Porch was de&s;igned by <HI>Hans Holbein.</HI> The Hall-&s;ide, being burnt down &s;ome Years ago, was rebuilt by the late <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> then Lord High-Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> in a very noble and &s;umptuous manner. The other Parts, rebuilt by the fir&s;t <HI>Philip</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> were all de&s;igned by the famous <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> and fini&s;hed by him in the Year 1640.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="288">The Canal before the Hou&s;e lies parallel with the Road, and receives into it the whole River <HI>Willy,</HI> or at lea&s;t is able to do &s;o; it may indeed be &s;aid, that the River is made into a Canal. When we come into the Court-yards before the Hou&s;e, there are &s;everal Pieces of Antiquity to entertain the Cu|rious; as particularly a noble Column of Porphyry, with a Marble Statue of <HI>Venus</HI> on the Top of it; which, as they told me, is 32 Feet high, and of excellent Workman&s;hip, and that it came la&s;t from <HI>Candia,</HI> but formerly from <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P>As the late Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> was a Nobleman of great Learning, beyond mo&s;t Men of his high Rank, and a Ma&s;ter of Antiquity, he took Delight in col|lecting &s;uch valuable Pieces of Painting and Sculpture, as made <HI>Wilton</HI> Hou&s;e a perfect <HI>Mu&s;eum,</HI> or Re|ceptacle of Rarities; and we meet with &s;everal Things there, which are to be found no-where el&s;e in the World. I &s;hall particularize but a few; for a Volume might be employ'd in a full De&s;cription of them.</P>
<P>The Piece of our Saviour's wa&s;hing his Di&s;ciples Feet, which they &s;hew you in one of the fir&s;t Rooms you go into, is admirable. At the Foot of the great Stair-ca&s;e is a <HI>Bacchus</HI> as large as the Life, done in fine <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> Marble, carrying a young <HI>Bacchus</HI> on his Arm, the young one eating Grapes, and &s;hewing by his Countenance, he is plea&s;ed with the Ta&s;te of them. One ought to &s;top every Two Steps of this Stair-ca&s;e, as we go up, to contemplate the va&s;t Variety of Pictures that cover the Walls, and of &s;ome of the be&s;t Ma&s;ters in <HI>Europe</HI>; and yet this is but an Introduction to what is beyond them.</P>
<P>The great Geometrical Stair-ca&s;e it&s;elf is de&s;ervedly admired, and was the fir&s;t of this Kind in <HI>England</HI>; and the rich and magnificent Door-ca&s;e can hardly be parallell'd.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="289">'Tis univer&s;ally acknowledged, that the grand Apartment is one of the noble&s;t Pieces of Archi|tecture that has been hitherto produced; particularly the <HI>Salon</HI>; which is 60 Feet long, 30 high, and 30 broad; and when you are enter'd the&s;e grand Apartments, &s;uch Variety &s;trikes upon you every Way, that you &s;carce know to which Hand to turn your&s;elf fir&s;t. On one Side you &s;ee &s;everal Rooms filled with Paintings, all &s;o curious, and various, that it is with Reluctance you leave them; and looking another way, you are called off by a va&s;t Collection of Bu&s;ts, and Pieces of the greate&s;t Antiquity of the Kind, both <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman.</HI></P>
<P>In one End of the grand Room is the celebrated Family-picture by <HI>Vandyke,</HI> 20 Feet long, and 12 Feet high, containing 13 Figures as big as the Life; which rather appear as &s;o many real Per&s;ons, than the Production of Art: and all the other Pictures there are of the &s;ame incomparable Hand. It would be endle&s;s to de&s;cribe the whole Set of the Family-pictures, which take up this Room, unle&s;s we would enter into the Roof-tree of the Family, and &s;et down a Genealogical Line of the whole Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>After this fine Range of Beauties are &s;een, we are far from being at an End of our Surprize: there are three or four Rooms &s;till upon the &s;ame Floor, filled with Wonders: nothing can be finer than the Pictures them&s;elves, nothing more &s;urpri&s;ing than the Number of them. At length you de&s;cend the Back|&s;tairs, which are large, tho' not like the other, where not a Hand's Breadth is left vacant between the Pictures; and even the upper Rooms have &s;ome very good Pieces in them.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t of the Apartments are Marble Chimney-pieces of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Workman&s;hip, all carv|ed in <HI>Italy,</HI> with many curious Statues, Ba&s;&s;o Re|lievo's, and Pictures of the mo&s;t famous Ma&s;ters.

The <HI>Loggio</HI> in the Bowling-green, (which has Pil|lars beautifully ru&s;ticated, and is inriched with Niches and Statues) the <HI>Grotto,</HI> (the Front of which is curiou&s;ly carved without, as it is all Marble within, and has black Pillars of the <HI>Ionic</HI> Order, with Capi|tals of white Marble, and Four fine Ba&s;&s;o Relievo's from <HI>Florence</HI>) the Stables, and other Offices, are all Beauties in their Kind, which would tire De|&s;cription.</P>
<P>The Collection of Head-pieces, Coats of Mail, and other Armour for both Hor&s;e and Man, are al&s;o a Curio&s;ity. They &s;hew tho&s;e of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. <HI>Edward</HI> VI. and of an Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> nick|named <HI>Black Jack,</HI> which he wore when he be&s;ieged and took <HI>Bulloign</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> being the General who commanded in chief under the King; they are very curious and imbo&s;s'd. Twelve other complete Suits of Armour, of extraordinary Workman&s;hip, are al&s;o there; the re&s;t, being about 100, are only for common Hor&s;e-men.</P>
<P>The Garden Front is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t Pieces of the renowned <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> and is 194 Feet long.</P>
<P>The Gardens are on the South of the Hou&s;e, and extend them&s;elves beyond the River, a Branch of which runs thro' one Part of them; and &s;till South of the Gardens is the great Park, which reaches be|yond the Vale; the View opens to the great Down, which is properly called, by way of Di&s;tinction, <HI>Salisbury-plain,</HI> and leads from the City of <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> to <HI>Shaft&s;bury.</HI> Here al&s;o his Lord&s;hip has a <HI>Hare|warren,</HI> as 'tis called, tho' improperly. It has indeed been a Sanctuary for the Hares for many Years; but the Gentlemen complain, that it mars their Game; for that, as &s;oon as they put up a Hare <HI>for their Sport,</HI> if it be any-where within two or three Miles, away &s;he runs for the Warren, and there is an End of their Pur&s;uit. On the other hand,

it makes all the Countrymen turn Poachers, and de&s;troy the Hares, by what Means they can. The pre&s;ent Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who, as his Father had, has al&s;o a fine Ta&s;te in Architecture, has made a further Improvement with regard to Pro&s;pect, at this noble Hou&s;e, throwing down the Walls of the Garden, and making in&s;tead of them the newly in|troduced Haw-haw Walls, which afford a boundle&s;s View all around the Country from every Quarter. His Lord&s;hip has al&s;o built a mo&s;t magnificent Bridge over the River in his Garden, which is e&s;teemed the principal Ornament without Doors of this noble Seat.</P>
<P>From this plea&s;ant and agreeable Place I returned to <HI>Clarendon.</HI> The Road from <HI>Wilton</HI> to <HI>Shaft&s;|bury,</HI> called <HI>The Ten Mile Cour&s;e,</HI> is a fine Ridge of Downs, continued upon the Southern Bank of the River <HI>Nadder,</HI> with a &s;weet Pro&s;pect to the Right and Left all the way over the Towns and the Country on both Sides. The late Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> has placed a number'd Stone at every Mile, for the Benefit of Travellers. Between the 5th and 6th Mile is a pretty large Camp, called <HI>Chi&s;elbury,</HI> probably <HI>Roman</HI> in the Decline of the Empire. At the End of this Cour&s;e are three or four <HI>Celtic</HI> Bar|rows. In this Hill is a Quarry of Stone very full of Sea Shells. Not far off, in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Tisbury,</HI> near <HI>Warder-ca&s;tle,</HI> is a great Entrenchment in a Wood, which was probably a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Town near the <HI>Nadder.</HI></P>
<P>Returning, we &s;ee, upon the highe&s;t Eminence which overlooks <HI>Wilton,</HI> and the fertile Valley at the Union of the <HI>Nadder</HI> and <HI>Willy,</HI> the noted Place called <HI>King-barrow,</HI> mentioned <HI>p.</HI> 267. This is certainly <HI>Celtick,</HI> &s;ays Dr. <HI>Stukeley,</HI> and, with great Probability, the very Tomb of that <HI>Carvilius,</HI> who attacked <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Sea-camp in order to divert his renown'd Enemy from his clo&s;e Pur&s;uit of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ibelan.</HI>

<P>The Downs and Plains in this Part of <HI>England</HI> being &s;o open, and the Surface &s;o little &s;ubject to Alteration, there are more Remains of Antiquity to be &s;een upon them, than in other Places; and, as they tell us, no le&s;s than Three-and-fifty antient Incampments, or Fortifications, in this one County; &s;ome of which are very vi&s;ible, and are of different Forms, and erected by different Nations; as <HI>Briti&s;h, Dani&s;h, Saxon,</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI>; particularly at <HI>Ebb|down, Burywood, Oldburgh-hill, Cummerford, Round|way-down, St. Anne's-hill, Bratton-ca&s;tle, Clay-hill, Stournton-park, Whitecole-hall, Battlebury, Scrath|bury, Yanesbury, Frippsbury, Suthbury-hill, Ambre&s;|bury,</HI> mentioned before; <HI>Great Bodwyn, Ea&s;terley, Merdon, Aubery, Marten&s;cil-hill, Barbury-ca&s;tle,</HI> &amp;c. At <HI>Aubery,</HI> or <HI>Aukbury,</HI> in particular, on the Ea&s;t Side of the <HI>Avon,</HI> by <HI>Great Dornford,</HI> is a very large Camp, covering the whole Top of a Hill.

<P>North of the&s;e is <HI>Martin's-hall-hill,</HI> a va&s;t Sta|tionary <HI>Roman</HI> Camp. On two Sides the Precipice is dreadfully &s;teep.

<P>At <HI>Farlo,</HI> not far from <HI>Clarendon-Park,</HI> was the Birth-place of Sir <HI>Stephen Fox,</HI> and where the Town, &s;haring in his good Fortune, &s;hews &s;everal Marks of his Bounty; as particularly the building a New Church from the Foundation, and getting an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed, for making it Parochial, it being but a Chapel of Ea&s;e before to an adjoining Pari&s;h: al&s;o Sir <HI>Stephen</HI> built and endowed an Alms-hou&s;e here for Six poor Women, with a Ma&s;ter and a Free-&s;chool.

<P>I am now to pur&s;ue my fir&s;t De&s;ign, and &s;hall take the We&s;t Part of <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> in my Return, where are &s;everal Things to be &s;till taken notice of. In the mean time I went on to <HI>Langbro',</HI> a fine Seat of my Lord <HI>Colerain,</HI> which is very well kept.</P>
<P>From hence in my Way to the Sea-&s;ide I came to <HI>New-Fore&s;t,</HI> of which I have &s;aid &s;omething already with relation to the great Extent of Ground; which lies wa&s;te, and has a va&s;t Quantity of large Timber.</P>
<P>This Part of the Country is a la&s;ting Monument of the <HI>Conqueror</HI>'s Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion, who laid it open and wa&s;te for a Fore&s;t, and for Game; for which Purpo&s;e he unpeopled the Country, pulled down the Hou&s;es and the Churches of &s;everal Pari&s;hes and Towns, and of abundance of Villages, turning the poor People out of their Habitations and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, for the &s;ake of his Deer.

And another Son, whil&s;t in hot Pur&s;uit of the Game, was caught up by the Boughs of a Tree, and hanged like <HI>Ab&s;alom.</HI> The&s;e they relate as ju&s;t Judgments of God on the cruel Deva&s;tation made here by the Conqueror, and they &s;till &s;hew the Tree on which the Arrow glanced. In King <HI>Charles</HI> II's Time, the Tree was ordered to be &s;ur|rounded with a Pale, great Part of which is now fallen down; and whether the Tree be really &s;o old or not, is to me a great Que&s;tion, the Action being about 700 Years ago.</P>
<P>I cannot omit mentioning here a Propo&s;al made &s;ome Years ago to the Lord Trea&s;urer <HI>Godolphin,</HI> for repeopling this Fore&s;t, which I can be more particular in than any other Man, becau&s;e I had the Honour to draw up the Scheme, and argue it before that noble Lord, and &s;ome others who were principally concerned at that time in bringing over, or rather providing for, when they were come over, the poor Inhabitants of the <HI>Palatinate</HI>; a Thing in it&s;elf commendable; but, as it was managed, made of no Benefit to <HI>England,</HI> and mi&s;erable to tho&s;e poor People.</P>
<P>Some Per&s;ons being ordered by the noble Lord above-mentioned, to con&s;ider of Mea&s;ures how tho&s;e poor People &s;hould be provided for, without Injury to the Publick, NEW FOREST in <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> was &s;ingled out to be the Place for them.</P>
<P>Here it was propo&s;ed to draw a great &s;quare Line, containing 4000 Acres of Land, marking out Two large Highways or Roads thro' the Centre, cro&s;&s;ing both Ways, &s;o that there &s;hould be 1000 Acres in each Divi&s;ion, exclu&s;ive of the Land contained in the &s;aid Cro&s;s-roads.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="295">Then to &s;ingle out 20 Men and their Families, who &s;hould be recommended as hone&s;t indu&s;trious People, expert in, or at lea&s;t capable of being in|&s;tructed in Hu&s;bandry. To each of the&s;e &s;hould be parcelled, but in equal Di&s;tributions, 200 Acres of this Land; &s;o that the whole 4000 Acres &s;hould be di&s;tributed to the &s;aid 20 Families, for which they &s;hould have no Rent to pay, and be liable to no Taxes, but &s;uch as would provide for their own Sick or Poor, repairing their own Roads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Exemption to continue for 20 Years, and then to pay each 50<HI>l.</HI> a Year to the Crown.</P>
<P>To each of the&s;e Families, it was propo&s;ed to advance 200<HI>l.</HI> in ready Money, as a Stock to &s;et them to work, and to hire and pay Labourers, to inclo&s;e, clear, and cure the Land; which it was &s;uppo&s;ed, the fir&s;t Year, could not be &s;o much to their Advantage as following Years, allowing them Timber out of the Fore&s;t to build them&s;elves Hou&s;es and Barns, Sheds and Offices, as they &s;hould have Occa&s;ion; al&s;o for Carts, Waggons, Ploughs, Harrows, and the like nece&s;&s;ary Things.</P>
<P>The&s;e 20 Families would, by the Con&s;equence of their own Settlements, employ and maintain &s;uch a Proportion of others of their own People, that the whole Number of <HI>Palatines</HI> would have been provided for, had they been many more than they were, and that without being any Burden upon, or Injury to the People of <HI>England</HI>; on the contrary, they would have been an Advantage, and an Addition of Wealth and Strength to the Nation, and to the Country in particular, where they &s;hould be thus &s;eated.</P>
<P>Two Things would have been an&s;wered by the Execution of this Scheme; <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the annual Rent to be received for all tho&s;e Lands after 20 Years, would abundantly pay the Publick for the fir&s;t Di&s;bur&s;es, which
<PB N="289" REF="296">
would amount to 80,000<HI>l.</HI> that Rent being then to amount to 40,000<HI>l. per Annum.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. More Money than would have done this, was thrown away upon them here, to keep them in Su&s;pen&s;e, and afterwards &s;tarve them; &s;ending them a begging all over the Nation, and &s;hip|ping them off to peri&s;h in other Countries.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Spot where the De&s;ign was laid out, was near <HI>Lindhur&s;t,</HI> in the Road from <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> to <HI>Lymington:</HI> whither I now directed my Cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Lymington</HI> is a little, but populous Sea-port, &s;tand|ing oppo&s;ite to the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> in the narrow Part of the Streight, which Ships &s;ometimes pa&s;s thro' in fair Weather, called the <HI>Needles</HI>; and right again&s;t the antient Town of <HI>South-Yarmouth,</HI> in that I&s;le which I have mentioned before. This Town of <HI>Lymington</HI> is chiefly noted for making excellent Salt; from whence all the&s;e South Parts of <HI>England</HI> are &s;upplied, as well by Water as Land-carriage.</P>
<P>From hence are but few Towns on the Sea-coa&s;t We&s;t, tho' &s;everal con&s;iderable Rivers empty them|&s;elves into the Sea; nor are there any Harbours or Sea-ports of Note, except <HI>Pool.</HI> As for <HI>Chri&s;t-church,</HI> tho' it &s;tands at the Mouth of the <HI>Avon,</HI> which, as I have &s;aid, comes down from <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and brings with it all the Waters of South and Ea&s;t Parts of <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> and receives al&s;o the <HI>Stour</HI> and <HI>Piddle,</HI> Two <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI> Rivers, which bring with them all the Waters of the North Part of <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI>; yet it is a very incon&s;iderable poor Place, &s;carce worth &s;eeing, and le&s;s worth mentioning in this Account.

<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Wimburnmin&s;ter</HI> are numerous, but poor, and chiefly maintain'd by the Manufacture of knitting Stockens, which employs great Part of
<PB N="292" REF="299">
the County of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> of which this is the fir&s;t Town Ea&s;tward.</P>
<P><HI>Wimbourn St. Giles</HI>'s, in this Neighbourhood, is a very hand&s;ome Seat belonging to the Earl of <HI>Shafte&s;|bury.</HI></P>
<P>From hence I went to <HI>Ringwood,</HI> upon the River <HI>Avon,</HI> over a deep &s;andy Moor. 'Tis a large thriving Place, full of good new Brick Hou&s;es, &s;eated by the Side of a great watry Valley, the River dividing it|&s;elf into &s;everal Streams, and frequently overflowing large Quantities of the Meadow. Here they deal pretty much in Leather, Stockens, Druggets, and narrow Cloth.</P>
<P>South of <HI>Wimburn,</HI> over a &s;andy, wild and barren Country, we came to <HI>Pool,</HI> a con&s;iderable Sea-port, and indeed the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in all this Part of <HI>England</HI>; for here I found &s;ome Ships, &s;ome Mer|chants, and &s;ome Trade; e&s;pecially here was a good Number of Ships fitted out every Year to the <HI>New|foundland</HI> Fi&s;hing, in which the <HI>Pool Men</HI> have been particularly &s;ucce&s;sful for many Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Town &s;its in the Bottom of a great Bay, or Inlet of the Sea, which, entering at one narrow Mouth, opens to a great Breadth within the Entrance, and comes up to the very Shore of this Town; it runs al&s;o We&s;t up almo&s;t to <HI>Warcham,</HI> a little below which it re|ceives the <HI>Froom</HI> and <HI>Piddle,</HI> the Two principal Ri|vers of the County.</P>
<P>This Place is famous for the be&s;t and bigge&s;t Oy|&s;ters in all this Part of <HI>England,</HI> which the People of <HI>Pool</HI> pretend to be famous for pickling; and they are barrell'd up here, and &s;ent not only to <HI>London,</HI> but to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and to <HI>Spain, Italy,</HI> and other Parts. 'Tis ob&s;erv'd, more Pearl are found in the <HI>Pool</HI> Oy&s;ters, and larger, than in any others in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>As the Entrance into this large Bay is narrow, &s;o it is made narrower by an I&s;land called <HI>Brank&s;ey,</HI>
<PB N="293" REF="300">
which lying in the very Mouth of the Pa&s;&s;age, divides it into two, and where there is an old Ca&s;tle, call'd <HI>Brank&s;ey</HI> Ca&s;tle, built to defend the Entrance, and was of no &s;mall Advantage to the Trade of this Port, in the time of the late War with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wareham</HI> has been a <HI>Roman</HI> Town. There has been a Ca&s;tle by the Water-&s;ide, We&s;t of the Bridge, built by King <HI>William</HI> I. perhaps upon the <HI>Roman.</HI> 'Tis an old Corporation, now decay'd, the Sands ob&s;tructing the Pa&s;&s;age of the Ve&s;&s;els. And <HI>Pool</HI> being better &s;eated, from a Fi&s;her-Town, has ri&s;en to be a rich Sea-port. They &s;ay here have been a Mint, and many Pari&s;h-Churches, of which Three remain. I &s;aw a ruinous Religious Hou&s;e, as I pa&s;s'd by the River <HI>Frome.</HI> This Haven is of va&s;t Extent, like a Sea, having a narrow Entry. Two Rocks about <HI>Corf-Ca&s;tle</HI> have an odd Appearance hence.</P>
<P>South of <HI>Wareham,</HI> and between the Bay I have mention'd, and the Sea, lies a large Track of Land, which being &s;urrounded by the Sea, except on one Side, is call'd an I&s;land, tho' it is really more pro|perly a Penin&s;ula. This Track of Land is better inhabited than the Sea Coa&s;t of this We&s;t End of <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI> generally is, and the Manufacture of Stockens is carry'd on there al&s;o. It is call'd <HI>The I&s;le of Purbeck,</HI> and has in the middle of it a large Market-town, call'd <HI>Corf</HI>; and from the famous Ca&s;tle there, the whole Town is now call'd <HI>Corf-Ca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>This Part of the Country is eminent for va&s;t Quarries of Stone, which is cut out flat, and u&s;ed in <HI>London</HI> in great Quantities, for paving Court-yards, Alleys, Avenues to Hou&s;es, Kitchens, Foot-ways on the Sides of the High-&s;treets, and the like; and is very profitable to the Place, as al&s;o in the Num|ber of Shipping employed in bringing it to <HI>London.</HI> There are al&s;o &s;everal Rocks of very good Marble,
<PB N="294" REF="301">
only that the Veins in the Stone are not black and white, as the <HI>Italian,</HI> but grey, red, and other Co|lours. It is al&s;o noted for excellent Tobacco-pipe Clay, &s;old at <HI>London</HI> for Thirty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Ton.</P>
<P>From hence to <HI>Weymouth</HI> we rode in View of the Sea. The Country is open, and in &s;ome re|&s;pects plea&s;ant, but not like the Northern Parts of the Country, which are all fine Carpet Ground, and the Herbage &s;o &s;weet, that their Sheep are e&s;teem'd the be&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> and their Wool extremely fine.</P>
<P>From hence we turned up to <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> the County Town. It is regular and clean. The <HI>I&s;ening-&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">reet</HI> enters it by the North of <HI>Winterburn</HI> at <HI>We&s;t-gate.</HI> This is by the ignorant Country-people referr'd to the Work of the Devil, who, they &s;ay, ca&s;t it up in a Night's time. The Foundations of the antient <HI>Roman</HI> Wall appear qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e round the Town; but Ea&s;tward a Street is built upon it, and the Ditch fill'd up: 'tis &s;till call'd <HI>The Walls</HI>; for that way the Town is &s;well'd out into a con&s;iderable Village, with a Church, and hand&s;ome Tower, nam'd <HI>Fordington</HI> or <HI>Farington.</HI> There are Three other Churches in the Town, and the Streets are wide and hand&s;ome. On the South and We&s;t Side, with|out the Walls, a hand&s;ome Walk of Trees is planted, looking plea&s;antly into the Country; tho' being com|mon S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">camores, they are inconvenient by harbouring Flies. The Banks of the River here are &s;teep; for the Town &s;tands on high Ground. Beyond the River are Meadows, and warm &s;andy Lands; on this Side, the fine chalky Downs, plea&s;ant for riding, and pro|fitable in excellent Grain. The Air mu&s;t needs be whol&s;ome, the Climate warm, and a &s;ufficient Di|&s;tance from the Sea. The People of <HI>Fordington</HI> ro&s;e in Arms, and prevented the Farmers from levelling a great Barrow. The late Rev. Mr. <HI>Place,</HI> known for his Philo&s;ophical Works, liv'd here, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd a great Quantity of <HI>Roman</HI> Coins, call'd here <HI>Dorn-money,</HI>
<PB N="295" REF="302">
or <HI>King Dor's Money.</HI> Near this Place is a noble <HI>Roman</HI> Amphitheatre. The Vulgar call it <HI>Maumbury</HI>; but have no Notion of its Purpo&s;e, tho' 'tis a common Excur&s;ion for the Inhabitants; and the Terrace on the Top is a noted Place of Ren|dezvous, affording an agreeable circular Walk, a Pro|&s;pect of the Town, and wide Plains of Corn Fields all around.</P>
<P><HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> is a regular Town, with hand&s;ome wide Streets, but the Hou&s;es, tho' built of Stone, are old and low. It is kept very clean, by rea&s;on of its high Situation, and the River on which it is &s;ituated.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants Care in &s;etting the able Poor to work, and relieving the Aged and Impotent, is high|ly prai&s;e-worthy. And Sir <HI>Jo&s;iah Child,</HI> in his Treati&s;e on Trade, recommends their Example as worthy to be followed by other Places. It is famous al&s;o for excellent Beer.</P>
<P>On the plea&s;ant Downs round this Town, they told me, there were 600,000 Sheep fed within Six Miles of the Town every way, which is 12 Miles in Diameter, and 36 Miles in Circumference; and when I viewed the Country round, I confe&s;s I could not but incline to believe it.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable of the&s;e Sheep, that they are ex|ceedingly fruitful; and the Ewes generally bringing Two Lambs, they are for that Rea&s;on bought by all the Farmers thro' the Ea&s;t Part of <HI>England,</HI> who come to <HI>Burford</HI> Fair in this County for that Pur|po&s;e; and carry them into <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Surrey</HI> Ea&s;tward, and into <HI>Buckingham&s;hire, Bedford&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Oxford|&s;hire</HI> North. Even our <HI>Ban&s;tead-Downs</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> &s;o fam'd for good Mut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">on, is &s;upplied from this Place. The Herbage of the&s;e Downs is full of the mo&s;t aromatick Plants, &s;uch as nouri&s;h the Sheep to a great Degree, and the Sheeps Dung again nouri&s;hes that; &s;o that the Valleys are render'd extremely

fruitful by the wa&s;hing of the Water in ha&s;ty Showers from off the&s;e Hills.</P>
<P>From <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> it is Six Miles to the Sea-&s;ide South, and the Ocean in View almo&s;t all the Way: The fir&s;t Towns we come to are <HI>Weymouth</HI> and <HI>Mel|comb,</HI> two Towns lying at the Mouth of a little Rivulet, call'd <HI>The Wey,</HI> for it &s;carce de&s;erves the Name of a River: however, the Entrance makes a very good, tho' &s;mall Harbour, and they are join'd by a wooden Bridge, &s;o that nothing but the Har|bour parts them; yet they are &s;eparate Corporations, and choo&s;e each of them Two Members of Parlia|ment.</P>
<P><HI>Weymouth</HI> is a &s;weet, clean, agreeable Town, (con&s;idering its low Situation) and clo&s;e to the Sea: 'tis well-built, and has a great many &s;ub&s;tantial Merchants in it, who drive a con&s;iderable Trade, and have a great Number of Ships belonging to the Town: they carry on, in time of Peace, a Trade with <HI>France</HI>; but be&s;ides this, they trade al&s;o to <HI>Portugal, Spain, Newfoundland,</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI>; and have a large Corre&s;pondence up in the Country for the Con&s;umption of their Returns. The Wine and <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Trade are both con&s;iderable here; and they have a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and good Key.</P>
<P>Without the Harbour is an old Ca&s;tle, call'd <HI>Sandfoot Ca&s;tle</HI>; and over-again&s;t them is <HI>Portland Ca&s;tle,</HI> &s;ituated in the I&s;le of that Name, and the Road called <HI>Portland Road,</HI> which affords a &s;afe Harbour for Ships in bad Weather.</P>
<P>From this I&s;le of <HI>Portland</HI> comes our be&s;t and white&s;t Free-&s;tone, with which the Cathedral of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, the Monument, and all the publick Edi|fices in the City of <HI>London,</HI> are chiefly built; and the Quarries whence the&s;e Stones are dug, are well worth the Ob&s;ervation of a Traveller.</P>
<P>The I&s;land is indeed little more than one conti|nued Rock of Free-&s;tone, about Seven Miles in Com|pa&s;s,
<PB N="297" REF="304">
and the Height of the Land is &s;uch, that from this I&s;land they &s;ee, in clear Weather, above half over the Chanel to <HI>France,</HI> tho' here 'tis very broad. The Sea off this I&s;land, and e&s;pecially to the We&s;t of it, is counted the mo&s;t dangerous Part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Chanel. Due South, there is almo&s;t a continued Di&s;turbance in the Waters, by rea&s;on of what they call Two Tides meeting; which I take to be no more than the Sets of the Currents from the <HI>French</HI> Coa&s;t, and from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Shore: this they call <HI>Portland Race</HI>; and &s;everal Ships, not aware of the&s;e Currents, have been embay'd to the We&s;t of <HI>Portland,</HI> and driven on Shore on the Beach, (of which I &s;hall &s;peak pre&s;ently) where they have been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>To prevent this Danger, and guide the Mariner in the&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, they have &s;et up Two Light-hou&s;es on the Two Points of that I&s;land, which are very u&s;eful and &s;erviceable to Ships.</P>
<P>This I&s;land, tho' &s;eemingly mi&s;erable, and thinly inhabited, yet the Inhabitants being almo&s;t all Stone-cutters, we found there were no very poor People among them; and when they collected Money for the rebuilding St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, they got more in this I&s;land than in the great Town of <HI>Dorche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' <HI>Portland</HI> &s;tands a League from the main Land of <HI>Britain,</HI> yet it is almo&s;t join'd by a pro|digious Riff of Beach, that is to &s;ay, of &s;mall Stones ca&s;t up by the Sea, which runs from the I&s;land &s;o near the Shore of <HI>England,</HI> that they ferry over with a Boat and a Rope, the Water not being above half a Stone's-throw over; and the &s;aid Riff of Beach ending, as it were, at that Inlet of Water, turns away We&s;t, and runs parallel with the Shore quite to <HI>Abbot&s;bury,</HI> a Town about Seven Miles beyond <HI>Weymouth.</HI></P>
<P>I name this to explain what I &s;aid before, of Ships being embay'd and lo&s;t here: this is when, coming
<PB N="298" REF="305">
from the We&s;tward, they omit to keep a good <HI>Offing,</HI> or are taken &s;hort by contrary Winds, and cannot weather the high Land of <HI>Portland</HI>; but are driven between <HI>Portland</HI> and the main Land, and run on Shore on that va&s;t Beach.</P>
<P>On the In&s;ide of this Beach, and between it and the Land, is the &s;aid Inlet of Water, which they ferry over, as above, to pa&s;s and repa&s;s to and from <HI>Portland.</HI> This Inlet opens at about Two Miles We&s;t, grows very broad, and makes a kind of Lake within the Land of a Mile and a half broad, and near Three Miles in Length, the Breadth un|equal. At the farthe&s;t End We&s;t of this Water is a large Decoy, and the Verge of the Water well grown with Wood, and proper Groves of Trees for Cover for the Fowl. In the open Lake, or broad Part, is a continual A&s;&s;embly of Swans: here they live, feed and breed; and the Number of them is &s;uch, that, I believe, I did not &s;ee &s;o few as 7 or 8000. We &s;aw &s;everal of them upon the Wing, very high in the Air; whence we &s;uppo&s;ed, they flew over the Riff of Beach, which parts the Lake from the Sea, to feed on the Shores.</P>
<P>From this Decoy We&s;t, the Lake narrows, and at la&s;t almo&s;t clo&s;es, till the Beach joins the Shore; and &s;o <HI>Portland</HI> may be &s;aid not to be an I&s;land, but Part of the Continent. And now we came to <HI>Abbot&s;bury,</HI> a Town antiently famous for a great Mona&s;tery, and now eminent for nothing but its Ruins.</P>
<P>From hence we went on to <HI>Bridport,</HI> a pretty large, but not well-built Corporation Town on the Sea Shore: here we &s;aw Boats all the way on the Shore fi&s;hing for Mackerel, which they take in the ea&s;ie&s;t manner imaginable, and in &s;uch prodigious Plenty, that there has been a Watch &s;et to prevent Farmers dunging their Land with them, which, it was thought, might be apt to infect the Air.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="306">In the Year 1722 an Act pa&s;&s;ed for re&s;toring and rebuilding the Haven and Piers of <HI>Bridport,</HI> in or|der to bring it to its antient flouri&s;hing State; for heretofore it was a Place of great Trade and Com|merce; but by rea&s;on of a great Sickne&s;s, which formerly &s;wept away the greate&s;t Part of its mo&s;t wealthy Inhabitants, and by other Accidents, the Haven became neglected, and choaked with Sands; the Piers fell to Ruin, and the Town, of con&s;e|quence, to Decay; &s;o that there was no Security for Ships that happened to be driven by Stre&s;s of Wea|ther into the deep and dangerous Bay, wherein the Haven formerly was, which occa&s;ioned frequent Shipwrecks. The Act therefore authorizes the Bai|liffs and Burge&s;&s;es of <HI>Bridport</HI> to levy certain Tolls and Duties on divers Merchandizes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in order to re&s;tore the &s;aid Piers and Harbour.</P>
<P><HI>Bridport</HI> was formerly the only Place for twi&s;ting of Ropes for the Royal Navy: and it is &s;till u&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e, the neighbouring Lands yielding plen|ty of Hemp.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bridport</HI> we came to <HI>Lyme,</HI> a Town par|ticularly made famous by the Landing of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth, June</HI> 11. 1685, in the Time of King <HI>James</HI> II. with only Twelve Men. Many of his Party were afterwards put to Death on the Spot, and their Limbs hung up in the Town. Before that Time the Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> &s;et Footing here in his Tour to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This is called <HI>Lyme-Regis:</HI> it is a Town of good Figure, and has in it &s;everal eminent Merchants, who carry on a con&s;iderable Trade to <HI>France, Spain, Newfoundland,</HI> and the <HI>Streights</HI>; and tho' they have neither Creek or Bay, Road or River, they have a good Harbour; and &s;uch as is not in all <HI>Bri|tain</HI> be&s;ides, if in the World.</P>
<P>It is a ma&s;&s;y Pile of Building, con&s;i&s;ting of high and thick Walls of Stone, rai&s;ed, at fir&s;t, with all
<PB N="300" REF="307">
the Methods that Art could devi&s;e, and maintain'd now with very little Difficulty: the Walls are rai&s;ed in the main Sea, at a good Di&s;tance from the Shore. It con&s;i&s;ts of one main and &s;olid Wall of Stone, large enough for Carts and Carriages to pa&s;s on the Top, and to admit Hou&s;es and Ware-hou&s;es to be built on it; &s;o that it is broad as a Street. Oppo&s;ite to this, but farther into the Sea, is another Wall of the &s;ame Workman&s;hip, which cro&s;&s;es the End of the fir&s;t, and comes about with a Tail, parallel to that.</P>
<P>Between the Point of the fir&s;t or main Wall, is the Entrance into the Port; and the &s;econd or op|po&s;ite Wall breaking the Violence of the Sea from the Entrance, the Ships go into the Ba&s;in, and ride there as &s;ecure as in a Mill-pond, or Wet-dock.</P>
<P>This Work is call'd the <HI>Cobb:</HI> the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers have a Lodge and Ware-hou&s;e upon it. It might be &s;trengthen'd with a Fort, and the Walls them&s;elves are firm enough to carry what Guns they plea&s;e to plant upon it; but they did not &s;eem to think it needful: and as the Shore is convenient for Batteries, they have &s;ome Guns planted in proper Places, for the Defence of the <HI>Cobb,</HI> and the Town.</P>
<P>This Town is under the Government of a Mayor and Aldermen, and may pa&s;s for a Place of Wealth, con&s;idering the Bigne&s;s of it. Here we found the Merchants began to trade in the Pilchard Fi&s;hing, tho' not to &s;o con&s;iderable a Degree as they do farther We&s;t; the Pilchards &s;eldom coming up &s;o high Ea&s;t|ward as <HI>Portland,</HI> and not very often &s;o high as <HI>Lyme.</HI></P>
<P>I vi&s;ited from hence &s;ome of the Towns in the North-we&s;t Part of this Country, as <HI>Blandford,</HI> on the River <HI>Stour,</HI> in the Road between <HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> and <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> a hand&s;ome well-built Town, plea&s;antly &s;eated in a Flexure of the River, before charming

Meadows, and rich Lands. Wood thrives exceed|ingly here. Indeed this County is a fine Variety of Downs, Woods, Lawns, Arable and Pa&s;ture Land, rich Valleys, and an excellent Air. The dry Ea&s;ter|ly Winds, the cold Northern, and the We&s;tern Moi&s;ture, are temper'd by the warm Southern &s;aline Breezes, wa&s;ted hither from the Ocean. But <HI>Bland|ford</HI> is chiefly famous for making the fine&s;t Bone|lace in <HI>England,</HI> where they &s;hewed me, in my fir&s;t Vi&s;it to it, &s;ome &s;o exqui&s;itely fine, as I think I never &s;aw better in <HI>Flanders, France,</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> and which they &s;aid they rated at above 30<HI>l.</HI> Sterling a Yard.</P>
<P>This was the State and the Trade of the Town, when I was there in my fir&s;t Journey: but <HI>June</HI> 4. 1731, the whole Town, except Twenty-&s;ix Hou&s;es, was con&s;umed by Fire, together with the Church. The Con&s;ternation of the People was &s;o great, and the Fire &s;o furious, that few &s;aved any Goods.</P>
<P>An Act pa&s;&s;ed in 1732, for the better and more ea&s;y Rebuilding of this Town, and for determining Differences touching Hou&s;es and Buildings burnt down or demoli&s;hed therein; and as &s;everal wi&s;e Re|gulations were made by it, <HI>Blandford</HI> now makes a much better Appearance than ever.</P>
<P>From <HI>Blandford</HI> I went We&s;t to <HI>Stourbridge,</HI> which, and the Country round, is employ'd in the Manu|facture of Stockens; it was once famous for making the fine&s;t, be&s;t, and highe&s;t-pric'd knit Stockens in <HI>England</HI>; but that Trade is much decay'd, by the Increa&s;e of the Knitting-&s;tocken Engine, or Frame. which has de&s;troyed the Hand Knitting-trade for fine Stockens thro' the whole Kingdom, of which I &s;hall &s;peak in another Place.</P>
<P>From hence I came to <HI>Shireburn,</HI> a large and po|pulous Town, with One Collegiate or Conventual Church, and may ju&s;tly claim to have more Inhabit|ants in it than any Town in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> tho' it is

neither the County Town, nor &s;ends Members to Parliament. It was once a Bi&s;hop's See, which was removed to <HI>Sali&s;bury.</HI> The Church is &s;till a Reve|rend Pile, and &s;hews the Face of great Antiquity. Here begins the <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> Medley Cloathing, tho' this Town be in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI>; of which I &s;hall &s;peak at large in its Place.</P>
<P><HI>Shafte&s;bury</HI> is al&s;o on the Edge of this County, ad|joining to <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> being Fourteen Miles from <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> over that fine Down or Car|pet Ground, call'd <HI>Sali&s;bury-plain.</HI> It is not an extraordinary Town; but &s;ituated upon the Top of a high Hill, and which clo&s;es the Plain or Downs, and whence a new Scene is pre&s;ented, (<HI>viz.</HI>) a Pro|&s;pect of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> where 'tis all in|clo&s;ed, and grown with Woods, Fore&s;ts, and planted Hedge-Rows; the Country rich, fertile and popu|lous, the Towns and Hou&s;es &s;tanding thick, and being large and full of Inhabitants, and tho&s;e Inha|bitants fully employ'd in the riche&s;t and mo&s;t valua|ble Manufacture in the World, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloathing, as well the Medley, or mix'd Cloathing, as Whites, both for the Home and foreign Trade; on which I &s;hall be more particular in my Return thro' the We&s;t and North Part of <HI>Wilt&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shafte&s;bury</HI> has however lately received &s;ome Im|provements from the Genero&s;ity of a neighbouring Gentleman, and particularly in a fine Plantation on the Top of <HI>Park-Hill</HI>; which he was &s;o kind as to indulge the Inhabitants with for a Place of Walking and Diver&s;ion; but attempting, on the Strength of his good Offices to the Town, to pre&s;cribe to them in the Choice of a Member of Parliament, he has not met with the grateful Return he might have expected, Violence having been done to the very Plantation he had &s;o generou&s;ly devoted to the pub|lick Service and Plea&s;ure of the Inhabitants.</P>

<P><HI>Yeovil</HI> is a Market-town of good Re&s;ort, and &s;ome little Cloathing is carried on, in and near it. Its main Manufacture at this Time is Gloves. It deals al&s;o in Corn, Chee&s;e, Hemp, and all Sorts of Provi&s;ions.</P>

<P>It may not be unacceptable here to in&s;ert a general De&s;cription of this large County, which may con|vey to the Reader &s;ome Idea of the Nature of the
<PB N="304" REF="311">
Soil, its Productions, and the Method of Improve|ment as well as the Manufactures, and Merchandizes, on which the Trading Part of the Inhabitants &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>To begin then: The We&s;tern Part of the County bordering on <HI>Cornwall, viz.</HI> about <HI>Tavy&s;tock, Brid|de&s;tow, Oakhampton, Hol&s;worthy, Bideford, Great Torrington, Chulmleigh, Chagford, Moreton, Hamp|&s;ted,</HI> and all round the Skirts of <HI>Dartmore,</HI> as well as that large Fore&s;t it&s;elf, con&s;i&s;ts of a very coar&s;e, moory, or fenny Soil, very barren in its Nature; in &s;ome Places productive of nothing but a dwarf Kind of Furze of little or no Value. At other Places grow nothing but Ru&s;hes, or a coar&s;e, four Kind of Pa&s;turage, which the Cattle will not feed upon; and therefore it dries up and withers into a Sedge. The Soil here is generally a &s;tiff Clay, thro' which the Water cannot &s;oak away: this renders it very unhealthy, e&s;pecially to Sheep, which in tho&s;e Parts are of a &s;mall Kind, and very &s;ubject to the Rot, which (in wet Sea&s;ons e&s;pecially) de&s;troys them in great Numbers: and what adds to the Malady is, that neither the Indu&s;try of the Hu&s;bandman (for which this County is de&s;ervely famous) nor any Com|po&s;t that has yet been found out, will to any purpo&s;e cure this Sterility.</P>
<P>The principal, and indeed the only profitable Return that the Inhabitants can make out of tho&s;e Lands, is by breeding Black Cattle, for which they are very well adapted; for here are bred tho&s;e fine Oxen, in great Numbers, which, by the Drovers of <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and thereabouts, are brought up, and in their flat Feeding Lands, betwixt <HI>Bridge-water</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> (which I have &s;een almo&s;t covered with them) fattened fit for <HI>Smithfield</HI> Market, where they drive, and &s;ell them to the <HI>Londoners,</HI> who have not &s;o good Beef from any other Part of the Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="312">The Northern Parts of the County are of a quite different Nature from the former; for this generally con&s;i&s;ts of a dry healthy Soil, e&s;pecially about <HI>Ilford|combe, South Moulton, Dulverton,</HI> and all along the Brim of the Fore&s;t of <HI>Exmore.</HI> Tho&s;e Downs are far from being a luxuriant Feeding, but are very good Grazing for Sheep; and being well dre&s;&s;ed with Lime, (which is brought over hither by Water from <HI>Wales</HI>) Dung, Sand, and other Compo&s;t, manured by the indefatigable Labour of the Inhabitants, produce tolerable Crops of Corn. I &s;ay <HI>tolerable</HI> ones; for tho' they far exceed the Productions in <HI>Dor&s;et, Wilts, Hants,</HI> &amp;c. (where Sluggi&s;hne&s;s &s;o far prevails as to leave Dame Nature de&s;titute of the lea&s;t human A&s;&s;i&s;tance) the Fertility is by no means comparable to that of the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> and <HI>Middle</HI> Parts of the County, in the <HI>former</HI> of which a rich Marl, in &s;ome Parts, and a fertile, &s;andy Soil in others; and in the <HI>latter</HI> a fat, &s;trong Soil, of a deep-red Colour, intermixed with Veins of different Kinds of Loam, produce very great Crops of Corn, and Pea&s;e of the be&s;t Kind, not to be excelled in the whole I&s;land. Neither doth it fall behind in Mea|dow Ground, and Pa&s;turage, Clover, Eaver, and Trefoil Gra&s;s, and Turneps; as is evident to a Per|&s;on who goes thro' any of the Markets, and beholds the fine, well-fed Beef and Mutton, with which they are plentifully &s;tored.</P>
<P>About <HI>Teingmouth, Dartmouth, Totnes, Modbury, Plymouth, A&s;hburton,</HI> and all the South Parts of the County, (called the <HI>South-Hams</HI>) the Lands are ge|nerally of a different Kind from any of the former; in mo&s;t Places very good for Arable and Pa&s;ture, but e&s;pecially for Cyder Fruits. A great Part of this large Track lies on a <HI>Stratum</HI> of Marble, which the Inhabitants break up, and burn into Lime; and therewith dre&s;s their Lands, to their very great Im|provement. Neither is this all the Advantage they
<PB N="306" REF="313">
make of tho&s;e Quarries; for in many of them is found Stone, which for its Hardne&s;s, Soundne&s;s, and beautiful Veinings, rivals the be&s;t <HI>Italian</HI> Marbles, and falls very little, if any thing, &s;hort of them in Lu&s;tre. Great Quantities of this Stone are &s;ent to <HI>London,</HI> and other Places, where they are wrought up for the noble&s;t Purpo&s;es. At other Places on this South-coa&s;t, are Quarries of Slate, for covering Hou&s;es, and this likewi&s;e of the be&s;t Kind; which are not only fetched away by Land-carriage, to the Di&s;tance of Ten, Twelve, and Sixteen Miles, but great Quantities of them are &s;ent Coa&s;t-wi&s;e, to all the Towns on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Shore; and exported to <HI>Holland, Flanders,</HI> and other Places beyond Sea.</P>
<P>The Reader will not, by this De&s;cription, con|clude that the Lands in any Part of the County are all one and the &s;ame Kind; Downs, Fens, Rocks, and Wood-grounds, are inter&s;per&s;ed among the be&s;t Lands; as there are al&s;o &s;ome good Arable and Pa&s;ture, among&s;t the mo&s;t de&s;olate and barren; and whoever looks round him in his own Situation, will know in what Sen&s;e to take this general De&s;cription. To proceed:</P>
<P>At divers Places are found large Quantities of very good Oak Timber, as well as A&s;h, Elm, Beech, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;uch of it as grows in Places whence it can be convey'd either by Land or Water-carriage, to <HI>Ply|mouth</HI> Dock, are there &s;erved in for the U&s;e of his Maje&s;ty's Navy.</P>
<P><HI>Coppice-wood</HI> is &s;o very plenty, that altho' the Woollen Manufacturers take off great Quantities in Charcoal, and yet greater Quantities are expended in common Firing, (there being no Coal rai&s;ed in this County) yet the Price is &s;o low, that the Lands where it thrives well, will not generally pro|duce more than 5<HI>s. per</HI> Acre <HI>(communibus annis).</HI> The Lands in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> &s;ave only the Fore&s;t of <HI>Dartmore, Hallden-hill,</HI> and &s;ome Heaths, Moors,
<PB N="307" REF="314">
and coar&s;e Downs of no very large Extent, (which, for the mo&s;t part, are not capable of Improvement, not even by <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> Hu&s;bandry) are divided into &s;mall Inclo&s;ures, and (in Places where any Shrubs will grow) by quick&s;et Hedges, banked up Four or Five Feet high with Earth. And as the Inclo&s;ures are &s;mall, &s;o are the Farms or Tenements in the&s;e Parts, even to a very manife&s;t Inconvenience: for the general Method here is, for Gentlemen to lea&s;e out the Tenements of their Manors for 99 Years, determinable on Three Lives; taking Fines for &s;uch Lea&s;es, and re&s;erving no more than about One Shilling in the Pound of the yearly Value.</P>
<P>By this means, Men of &s;mall Fortunes find an Opportunity to lay out the little Money they have, in what they call <HI>Purcha&s;ing an E&s;tate,</HI> which like|wi&s;e &s;erves for a Settlement upon a Wife, for the Money &s;he brings. Hence a Family comes on, and craves a Maintenance out of a Farm of perhaps 20<HI>l.</HI> a Year; which &s;urely can produce but a very poor one: whereas 2 or 300<HI>l.</HI> &s;unk in this Purcha&s;e, would have enabled him to manage a Farm of 200<HI>l.</HI> a Year; out of which, by Indu&s;try and good Ma|nagement, the Family might not only live in a more plentiful manner, the Children be better educated, and in&s;tructed to under&s;tand the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Farm; but Money likewi&s;e laid up every Year to|wards &s;etting them out in the &s;ame Method of living. This I take to be the principal Cau&s;e of the Poverty and Hard&s;hip that appears in Country Places, and of the Difficulty of getting a good Tenant at Rack-rent, for any Farm who&s;e Value exceeds 100<HI>l.</HI> a Year.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have mentioned, that in my Way to <HI>Chard,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed thro' <HI>Axmin&s;ter,</HI> a pretty con&s;iderable Market-town, and the fir&s;t in the County of <HI>Devon.</HI> The great We&s;tern Road to <HI>London</HI> goes thro' this Town. Here my Curio&s;ity led me to go into the
<PB N="308" REF="315">
Church, and view the Monuments of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Princes (or rather the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sherburne</HI> and Two Dukes) who were &s;lain at the Battle of <HI>Brunaburgh</HI> in that Neighbourhood, fought by King <HI>Athel&s;tane</HI> with Seven <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Princes; over whom he obtained the Victory, in a Field thence called <HI>King's-field</HI> to this Day. The Monuments of tho&s;e <HI>Saxon</HI> Worthies were under Arches in the Walls of the Church, Two of which have been lately filled up.</P>
<P>Here, in Memory of the Victory, King <HI>Athel|&s;tane</HI> founded a Min&s;ter for Seven Prie&s;ts, which in After-ages were reduced to Two; for whom a Portion of Land was allotted called <HI>Prie&s;t-aller,</HI> which, with the Par&s;onage, now belongs to Two Prebendaries of the Church of <HI>York.</HI> The Manor continued in the Crown till the Reign of King <HI>John,</HI> who gave it to the Lord <HI>Brewer,</HI> a Daughter and Coheir of which Family <HI>(Alicia)</HI> brought it in Marriage to Lord <HI>Mobun</HI> of <HI>Dun&s;tar,</HI> who&s;e Po&s;te|rity, with Con&s;ent of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. <HI>Anno Gra|tiae,</HI> 1246. 8. <HI>Id.

<P><HI>Ford Abbey</HI> is in this Neighbourhood, heretofore a &s;tately Fabrick, lofty and very magnificent, adorned with curious Carvings and Embelli&s;hments of the <HI>Gothick</HI> kind, &s;ome of who&s;e Beauties &s;till remain, as may be &s;een in a modern Print thereof, publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Buck.</HI> It was fir&s;t founded by <HI>Adeliza,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Baldwin de Brioniis,</HI> Baron of <HI>Oak|hampton, Anno</HI> 1140, and dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> for <HI>Ci&s;tercian</HI> Monks: At the Surrender it was valued at 381<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> Half-penny, yearly.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Axmin&s;ter</HI> lies <HI>Kilmington,</HI> qua&s;i <HI>Kill-men-town,</HI> from the great Slaughter there made at the
<PB N="309" REF="316">
Battle before-mentioned; and <HI>Membury,</HI> i. e. <HI>Maim-burgh,</HI> whither the Maimed in that Battle were &s;ent to be relieved; now famous for the be&s;t <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> Chee&s;e.</P>
<P>At <HI>Northleigh,</HI> or rather, at <HI>Uplime,</HI> (which Ma|nor was formerly the Inheritance of the Abbey of <HI>Gla&s;tonbury</HI>) was born Mr. <HI>Nathanael Carpenter,</HI> the Author of the Treati&s;e of Geography, and divers others Tracts that bear his Name.</P>
<P><HI>Cullyford,</HI> in this Neighbourhood, was the Habi|tation of Sir <HI>Thomas Gates,</HI> who in 1609, bound to <HI>Virginia,</HI> (of which Colony he was then made Go|vernor) was in a violent Tempe&s;t &s;hipwreck'd, and with Sir <HI>George Somers</HI> ca&s;t on Shore, by which Accident they were made the fir&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the I&s;land of <HI>Bermudas,</HI> or <HI>Summer I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>This Track abounds with Lands, which were formerly appropriated to Churches and Religious Hou&s;es; <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Smallridge, Axmouth, Farwood, Salcombe, Dunkerwell,</HI> (a Mona&s;tery of <HI>Ci&s;tercian</HI> Monks) <HI>Sidbury, Sidmouth, Bran&s;combe, Monketon, Luppit, Awl&s;combe,</HI> and at divers other Places; which from the Richne&s;s of the Soil makes good the Ob&s;ervation, That the Religious of tho&s;e Days, made it their chief Endeavour to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the be&s;t Things of this World.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tidwell,</HI> alias <HI>Tide&s;well,</HI> is a Pond or Pool, which boils up like that of the &s;ame Name at <HI>Weeden,</HI> in <HI>Derby&s;hire.</HI> The &s;ame Road I was before in, brought me from <HI>Axmin&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Honiton.</HI></P>
<P>This is a large and beautiful Market-town, very populous and well-built; and is &s;o very remarkably paved with &s;mall Pebbles, that on both Sides the Way a little Chanel is left &s;houldered up; &s;o that it holds a &s;mall Stream of fine clear running Water, with a little &s;quare Dipping-place left at every Door; &s;o that every Family in the Town has a clear clean running Rivulet (as it may be called) ju&s;t at their
<PB N="310" REF="317">
own Door; and this is much finer, plea&s;anter, and more agreeable to look on, than that at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> which they &s;o much boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>Here we &s;ee the fir&s;t of the Serge-manufacture of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>; a Trade too great to be de&s;cribed in Miniature. It takes up this whole County, which is the large&s;t and mo&s;t populous in <HI>England, York&s;hire</HI> excepted; but <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> is &s;o full of great Towns, and tho&s;e Towns &s;o full of People, and tho&s;e People &s;o univer&s;ally employ'd in Trade and Manufactures, that it cannot be equall'd in <HI>England,</HI> nor perhaps in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Honiton</HI> &s;tands in the be&s;t and plea&s;ante&s;t Part of the whole County; and I cannot but recommend it to Gentlemen who travel this Road, that if they ob&s;erve the Pro&s;pect at <HI>Honiton</HI> for half a Mile, till they come down the Hill, and to the very Entrance into <HI>Honiton,</HI> the View of the Country is the mo&s;t beautiful Land&s;kip in the World, and I do not remember the like in any one Place in <HI>England.</HI> 'Tis ob&s;ervable, that the Market of this Town was kept originally on the <HI>Sunday,</HI> till it was changed by the Direction of King <HI>John.</HI> This Town is now much employ'd in the Trade of Lace-making.</P>
<P>On the Road from <HI>Honiton</HI> they have a beautiful Pro&s;pect almo&s;t all the Way to <HI>Exeter,</HI> which is 12 Miles.</P>
<P>On the Left-hand of this Road lies the Town of <HI>St. Mary Ottery,</HI> &s;o called, as &s;ome &s;ay, from the River <HI>Otter,</HI> and that from the Otters found formerly in it. This Town was given by King <HI>Edward the Confe&s;&s;or</HI> to the Church of <HI>St. Mary</HI> at <HI>Roan</HI> in <HI>Normandy</HI>; but was afterwards bought by <HI>Grandi&s;on,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Exeter,</HI> who made of it a Quarter College in 10 <HI>Edward</HI> III. and therein placed &s;ecular Prie&s;ts, with other Mini&s;ters, to whom he gave the whole Manor, Pari&s;h, Tythes, Fines, Spi|ritual Profits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which amounted to 304<HI>l.</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> yearly.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="318"><HI>Bicton,</HI> formerly <HI>Bicheton,</HI> was given by <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> to one of his Servants, called <HI>William Porto.</HI> It afterwards reverted to the Crown, and by <HI>Henry</HI> I. was given to one <HI>John Janitor,</HI> &s;o called from his Office; for by his Tenure, he was to keep the Pri&s;on for this County, by which Service it is held to this Day, by the worthy Owner thereof <HI>Henry Rolle,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who is at this time Knight of this Shire. His Ance&s;tor, Sir <HI>Henry Rolle,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> had it by Marriage with <HI>Anne,</HI> the Daughter of Sir <HI>Thomas Dennis,</HI> to who&s;e Family it came from the before-mentioned <HI>Janitor,</HI> thro' <HI>Balli&s;ter, Sackville,</HI> and <HI>Cople&s;tone.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we came to <HI>Exeter,</HI> the Capital of the County of <HI>Devon,</HI> a City which hath often changed its Name: for it was the <HI>Pen-Caer</HI> and <HI>Caer-Eske</HI> of the <HI>Britons</HI>; the <HI>Augu&s;ta</HI> of the <HI>Romans</HI>; the <HI>I&s;ca</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy</HI>; the <HI>I&s;ca-Damnoniorum</HI> of <HI>An|tonine</HI>; the <HI>Exance&s;ter</HI> of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> which was afterwards abreviated to <HI>Exce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Exeter,</HI> from the great Number of Monks there. It had for &s;ome time the Name of <HI>Monketon,</HI> but at length, from that large River which wa&s;hes its Walls, and bears the Name of <HI>Exe,</HI> (whether from the Fore&s;t of that Name where it ri&s;es, or the Fore&s;t from it, I can|not determine) it retains that of <HI>Exeter,</HI> which it &s;eems now to be varying for <HI>Exon.</HI> It was fir&s;t fortified with a Stone Wall (which &s;till remains in|tire) by King <HI>Athel&s;tane</HI>; and was for &s;ome time the Seat of the <HI>We&s;t-Saxon</HI> Kings.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Romans</HI> were here, is highly probable, among other Proofs, from their Coins, that have been dug up at divers Places: in particular, a Gold one of <HI>Nero</HI> at <HI>Exeter</HI>; one of <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> near <HI>Barn|&s;taple</HI>; &s;everal Silver ones of <HI>Severus,</HI> and other Emperors; but e&s;pecially from a great Quantity of them dug up about Twenty Years &s;ince at <HI>Exeter,</HI> within the Clo&s;e, together with the Urn in which
<PB N="312" REF="319">
they were buried. I &s;aw a great Number of tho&s;e, &s;ome of which were of Silver; but the greate&s;t Part of them were a Mixture of Tin and Copper; they had the Impre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Gordianus, Philippus,</HI> and other Emperors.</P>
<P>King <HI>Athel&s;tane</HI> founded here a Mona&s;tery to St. <HI>Mary</HI> and St. <HI>Peter,</HI> for Monks of the Order of St. <HI>Benedict.</HI> The Chapel of <HI>St. Mary</HI> now fitted up for a Library, and furni&s;hed with a pretty great Number of Books, (which are but of little U&s;e, becau&s;e placed in a very confu&s;ed Order) is the very Ea&s;termo&s;t Part of the Cathedral, and was doubtle&s;s the fir&s;t Beginning of that now hand&s;ome Fabrick. King <HI>Etheldred</HI> founded al&s;o, within the Clo&s;e, a Hou&s;e for Monks, and another for Nuns. Divers other Religious Hou&s;es, as the Priories of <HI>St. James, St. Nicolas, St. John Bapti&s;t</HI>; the <HI>Grey Fryers,</HI> &amp;c. were the Work of After-ages.</P>
<P>The Walls are in pretty good Repair, and make a Walk round the City, with the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing a fine Country on oppo&s;ite Hills, full of Wood, rich Ground, Orchards, Villages, and Gentlemens Hou&s;es. The Beauty of the Place con&s;i&s;ts of one long Street, called <HI>High-&s;treet,</HI> broad and &s;trait. The Hou&s;es are of a very old, but good Model, &s;pacious, commodious, and not inelegant. This Street is full of Shops well furni&s;hed, and all &s;orts of Trades look bri&s;k. The People are indu&s;trious and courteous: the Fair Sex are truly &s;uch, as well as numerous; their Complexion, and generally their Hair, of a fair Ca&s;t: they are genteel, di&s;engaged, of ea&s;y Carriage, and good Mien. There has been of late a va&s;t Increa&s;e of Buildings within and with|out the City. The Situation renders it of Nece&s;&s;ity clean, dry and airy. The Soil thither from <HI>Honyton</HI> is rather &s;andy than &s;tony; whence it mu&s;t needs be very healthful. There are many Book&s;ellers. In Dr. <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI>'s Garden an Head of the Empre&s;s
<PB N="313" REF="320">
<HI>Julia Domna,</HI> of a Colo&s;&s;ean Size, was dug up. The Head-dre&s;s is &s;uitable to tho&s;e Times; and neither the Manner nor Carving are de&s;picable, tho' the Graver has not done it Ju&s;tice. 'Tis the noble&s;t Relique of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Antiquity which we know of this Sort: 'tis 21 Inches from the Top of the Attire to the Chin, and belonged to a Statue of 12 Feet Pro|portion, originally &s;et upon &s;ome Temple or Palace. There is al&s;o an In&s;cription of <HI>Camillus.</HI></P>
<P>This Country remarkably abounds with Per&s;ons afflicted with the Gout; which is attributed to the Cu&s;tom of marling the Lands with Lime, and the great U&s;e of poor, &s;weet Cyder, e&s;pecially among the meaner People.</P>
<P>In the Northern Angle of the City, and highe&s;t Ground, &s;tands <HI>Rugemont-ca&s;tle,</HI> once the Re&s;idence of the <HI>We&s;t-Saxon</HI> Monarchs, afterwards of the Earls of <HI>Cornwall.</HI> 'Tis of a &s;quari&s;h Figure, not very large, inviron'd with a high Wall, and deep Ditch. It has a Rampire of Earth parallel to the Top of the Wall, forming a Terrace, which over|looks the City and Country. Here are the A&s;&s;ize-hou&s;e, and a Chapel.</P>
<P>The Bridge over the <HI>Exe</HI> is of great Length, and has Hou&s;es on both Sides, and at both Ends, with a con&s;iderable Vacancy in the Middle. In the <HI>Guild-hall</HI> are the Pictures of General <HI>Monk,</HI> and the Prince&s;s <HI>Henrietta-Maria.</HI></P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop's See of this We&s;tern Dioce&s;e hath had &s;everal Removes; for it was fir&s;t at <HI>Bodmyn</HI> for the County of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and &s;ince that at <HI>Tawton</HI> for this County.

<P><PB N="314" REF="321">On the South-&s;ide of the high Altar, in the Ca|thedral, were erected (and are there &s;till to be &s;een perfect, as when fir&s;t made) Three Seats, or Alcoves, adorned with <HI>Gothick</HI> Carvings, to the Height of about 25 Feet, which are &s;upported with Bra&s;s Pillars; in the Middle of the&s;e was the Bi&s;hop in&s;talled, by the King and Queen. The Form of Words thus:</P>

<P>The Church was about 400 Years in building, and very remarkable it is to behold the Uniformity with which it was carried on; for nobody can di&s;|cover the lea&s;t Incongruity in the Parts; &s;o much is it like the Workman&s;hip of one and the &s;ame Architect.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome antient funeral Monuments in the Cathedral; but fir&s;t, as Matter of the greate&s;t An|tiquity, let me take notice of the Bi&s;hop's Throne in the Choir, which, at the Di&s;&s;olution of Epi&s;co|pacy in King <HI>Charles</HI> I.'s Time was (as a u&s;ele&s;s Thing) taken down; but whether the Workman imploy'd to do it were well affected to that Order, or el&s;e had &s;ome private In&s;tructions from &s;ome|body in Power, who fore&s;aw that it would &s;ome time or other be of U&s;e again, certain it is, that a great deal of Care was taken of the Materials; for it is now replaced, and every Part of it as &s;ound and good as when fir&s;t made. The <HI>Gothick</HI> Carvings about the Canopy are at lea&s;t 60 Feet high, and a va&s;t deal of good Workman&s;hip (of that Kind)
<PB N="315" REF="322">
there is about it: it is, I believe, coeval with the See.</P>
<P>The antique Monuments, as I before mentioned, to be &s;een here, are particularly tho&s;e of <HI>Humphry Bohun</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford, Hugh Courtenay,</HI> Earl of <HI>Devon,</HI> and his Lady; the Lord <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> Sir <HI>Peter Carew,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Speke,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Stapleton, Dowrich</HI> of <HI>Dowrich</HI>; the Bi&s;hops <HI>Leofricus, Staf|ford, Bran&s;combe, Oldham, Bradbridge, Lacy, Cary,</HI> and others, e&s;pecially that of Bi&s;hop <HI>Stapleton,</HI> the pious Founder of <HI>Exeter-college</HI> in <HI>Oxford</HI>; which Society, in grateful Remembrance of their Bene|factor, have lately repaired and beautified his Monu|ment, which in regard to &s;ome of the Carvings about it, exce&s;s any thing I ever &s;aw of &s;o old a Date in the <HI>Gothick</HI> way.</P>
<P>The Altar-piece, done 100 Years ago, is a Re|pre&s;entation of the In&s;ide of the Church in Per&s;pective, an exqui&s;itely fine Piece of Painting, and (excepting only a little Injury it received from the Swords of the Saints Militant in the great Rebellion) exceedingly well pre&s;erved. The fine painted Gla&s;s, of which there is a great deal, underwent the Fury of the &s;ame pious Reformers, who after they had made a forcible Entry, and <Q REND="inline">"taken to them&s;elves <HI>this</HI> Hou&s;e of God in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,"</Q> under the Umbrage of an Ordinance of Parliament of the 28th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1643, broke out the be&s;t of tho&s;e Paintings, and irretrievably ruined all the Scripture Hi&s;tory therein repre&s;ented: neither was their Rage confined to tho&s;e brittle Materials; for the carved Figures of the Patriarchs, Prophets, Kings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which there were a great many, be|came Objects of their furious Zeal and Ignorance; for there the maimed Bodies are now to be &s;een, &s;ome without the Head; others have lo&s;t one or both Legs, or Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all of them &s;ome way or other mangled. And having by this means taken away what they feared would draw them into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, they
<PB N="316" REF="323">
divided this Cathedral by a Partition-wall betwixt the Choir and the main Body of it, one of which Di|vi&s;ions was made u&s;e of by an Independent, and the other by a Pre&s;byterian Congregation.</P>
<P>And now, that I am taking notice of the Deco|rations of this magnificent Piece of Antiquity, let me ju&s;t mention, that in one of its Towers is a very large Bell of about Sixty hundred Weight; and, in the other, a fine Ring of Ten large ones. An Organ of very good Workman&s;hip, and &s;upported by a Tetra-&s;tyle of very beautiful <HI>Gothick</HI> Columns, &s;tands where the before-mentioned Partition-wall did. The large&s;t Pipes in this In&s;trument are of a great Length, and 15 Inches in Diameter, which is &s;aid to be Two Inches more than tho&s;e at <HI>Ulm,</HI> which is &s;o famed for its Largene&s;s.</P>
<P>The well-fini&s;hed Alcove of modern Work, for the Bi&s;hop, and the Pulpit, and Pews of the like, in the Nave or Body of the Church, together with the neat Marble Font, and the Two Suits of Hangings for the Choir, one of Tape&s;try, and the other of Velvet, and the fine Suit of gilt Plate for the Com|munion Service, is all that I &s;hall further add about the grave and well-adapted Ornaments and Furniture of this Temple, or Hou&s;e of God.</P>
<P>To complete this De&s;cription with a Circum&s;tance which I think ought by no means to be pa&s;&s;ed over: The Solemnity, Decency, and affecting Harmony, with which the Service, and Mu&s;ick vocal and in&s;tru|mental, is generally performed, by the Choral-vicars, Organi&s;t, and Chori&s;ters; and (which is well worthy of Imitation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis no uncommon Thing to &s;ee 500 People here in a Morning, which is at lea&s;t five times as many as u&s;ually attend at <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s, or any other Six o'clock Chapel I was ever at: And 'tis commendable, that the <HI>Reader</HI> doth not here curtail the Morning Service, by leaving out any Part thereof, as in other Places they do.

<PB N="317" REF="324">
Winter and Summer, attend the daily Prayers at Six in the Morning; and their grave and pious Behaviour there; I &s;ay, all this together, render this Cathedral a Glory to the Dioce&s;e, the Envy of other Choirs, and the Admiration of Strangers.</P>
<P>Other antique Buildings of a publick Nature are the Chapter-hou&s;e and Cloi&s;ters, the Bi&s;hop's Palace, the Hou&s;es belonging to the Dean, the Chancellor, Trea&s;urer, and other Dignitaries of the Church; the <HI>Guildhall,</HI> the Walls, and Gates of the City, with tho&s;e of the Ca&s;tle, and the Clo&s;e; the Ho&s;pital of <HI>St. John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> 20 Pari&s;h Churches within the City and Liberties thereof, the Bridge over the River <HI>Exe,</HI> a large and very hand&s;ome Conduit for Water, in the Centre of the Four principal Streets; to which may be added, &s;ome Chapels and Alms-hou&s;es yet &s;tanding, and the Ruins of divers others; which are Monuments of the Piety of their Founders, and the Impiety of tho&s;e who neglect them.</P>
<P>Modern Buildings of a publick Nature this City hath not many to boa&s;t of: <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s, (one of the Twenty Churches before-mentioned) the Chancellor's Hou&s;e, a very hand&s;ome and well contrived Work-hou&s;e for the Poor, Three or Four Meeting-hou&s;es, a Quay for landing Goods, and a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, in|clude all that have been erected within 40 Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Civil Government of this City is by a Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-council; a Recorder, Sheriff, Four Stewards, a Chamberlain, and Town-clerk, who are attended by a Sword-bearer, who wears the Cap, and carries the Sword given by King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. before them to Church, and on all pub|lick Proce&s;&s;ions; Four Serjeants at Mace, and as many Staff-bearers; the former in Gowns, and the latter in Liveries, with Badges; and, which adds not a little to their Splendor, they keep a Band of Four Mu&s;icians in con&s;tant Pay.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="325">There are, moreover, Twelve Companies of in|corporated Trades, who, on publick Occa&s;ions, and on Gaudy-days, walk in the Mayor's Train, dre&s;&s;ed in Gowns, each Company having a Beadle, in a laced Cloak, bearing the En&s;igns of their &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ions, to u&s;her them.</P>
<P>For &s;upplying the Inhabitants with Water, there is brought-in a pretty large Quantity by &s;ubterraneous Pipes, from &s;ome Springs in the Pari&s;h of <HI>St. Sidwell,</HI> without <HI>Ea&s;t-gate,</HI> Part of which is repo&s;ited for com|mon U&s;e in the Conduit before-mentioned, and an|other Part is conveyed to the Hou&s;es of the Bi&s;hop, Dean, Canons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> within the Clo&s;e, and to a common Pump, ju&s;t at the We&s;t Entrance of the Cathedral. But all this would be far &s;hort of a &s;ufficient Supply, and therefore an exceeding good Engine is fixed in the River, the great Wheel of which working by the &s;ame Water, forces the River Water thro' Elm-trees bored for that Purpo&s;e, into a large Re&s;ervoir, fixed about 20 Feet above Ground, in the highe&s;t Part of the City adjoining to the <HI>Guildhall</HI>; from whence, thro' other Pipes, it is di&s;per&s;ed to all Parts of the City in great Plenty. The Expence of which, to each Hou&s;e-keeper that will have it, is from 15 to 30<HI>s.</HI> a Year, according to the Quantity their Oc|ca&s;ions require.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Exe</HI> was, heretofore, in its main Stream navigable to the Walls of the City; but, on a Difference between the Mayor, and the then Earl of <HI>Devon,</HI> on a very trifling Occa&s;ion; <HI>viz.</HI> Which of their Purveyors &s;hould be fir&s;t &s;erved with a Pot of Fi&s;h in the Market, that Earl revenged him&s;elf by choaking the Mouth of the River, and by making Weirs with Timber, Sand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thereby intirely ruining the Navigation thereof farther up than <HI>Top|&s;ham.</HI> And &s;o great was the Power and Ob&s;tinacy of the Earl at that time, that tho' the Citizens ob|tained
<PB N="319" REF="326">
a Decree in Equity for their Relief, it was never executed.</P>
<P>To remove this Inconvenience, the Inhabitants, about 40 Years &s;ince, by Aid of an Act of Parlia|ment, at a great Expence perfected a Work, which had been begun above 100 Years before; they cut a new Chanel for the Water, cro&s;s which they placed Sluices or Flood-gates: thro' the lowermo&s;t of tho&s;e Gates, they let in the flowing Tide, the Ebb of which immediately &s;huts the Gate, and that keeps up a Body of Water for about Two Miles, &s;ufficient to carry up the Ve&s;&s;els &s;o far in their Way; at which Place another of tho&s;e Gates &s;huts, after the Ve&s;&s;el is pa&s;t it, by Cap&s;terns there fixed for that Purpo&s;e. It mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that the Floor of the Dyke is thus far on a Level, and con&s;equently the Water of an equal Depth, without the Inconvenience of any Current, the lower Sluice being &s;hut as before.</P>
<P>The whole Declivity from the Quay at <HI>Exeter,</HI> to the lowermo&s;t Flood-gate at <HI>Top&s;ham,</HI> which gives the River its Current, is about Eight or Ten Feet, all which is &s;unk at once here, above this &s;econd Sluice; and therefore, in order to bring up Ships over this Fall, it was nece&s;&s;ary, that a third Flood|gate &s;hould be added; which is accordingly done, at about 200 Feet from the former. And now, the Ship being between the&s;e two Flood-gates, (the lower being kept &s;hut) the uppermo&s;t of the two is opened, and by this means the Water between them rai&s;ed to a Level with that of the Remainder of the Dyke above; and the Ship, by this Contrivance, floats freely over the ri&s;ing Ground; and thence, on the fre&s;h Water, (for the Tide is of no farther U&s;e) for about Two Miles more, which brings her to the Head of the Works, where there is another Flood-gate; and this ponds the whole River, &s;o as to throw the wa&s;te Water, over a &s;trong Stone Weir, into its natural Chanel. The Water &s;o kept back
<PB N="320" REF="327">
by this Upper-&s;luice, and the Weir, makes a &s;tag|nant Pool above; and here the Ve&s;&s;els lie at their Moorings, and unload at a Quay adjoining to the City Walls.</P>
<P><HI>Semper fidelis,</HI> is the Motto to the City Arms; and how ju&s;t a Title they have thereto, will appear from their Behaviour, when they have been attacked by the Enemies of their lawful Sovereign, of which take the following &s;hort Sketch:</P>
<P N="1">1. When the Town was quitted by the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Citizens defended it again&s;t the <HI>Saxons</HI> for their then lawful Ma&s;ters, the <HI>Britons</HI>; and held it out for 300 Years, after the Ea&s;tern Parts of the I&s;land had &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P N="2">2. When they had been compelled to admit the <HI>Saxons</HI> into a &s;ort of Co-ordinate Power with them, they courageou&s;ly with&s;tood the <HI>Danes,</HI> and tho' at la&s;t overcome by them, they took the fir&s;t Oppor|tunity, and joined with King <HI>Alfred,</HI> who with their A&s;&s;i&s;tance routed the <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. After this, as long as they were able, they up|held a Share of Government with the <HI>Saxons,</HI> un|til King <HI>Athel&s;tane</HI> wholly &s;ubdued them, and (as before-mentioned) fortified the Town with a Wall and Gates. This generous Prince was &s;o well plea&s;ed with their Bravery, that he granted them many Privileges and Immunities.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the Year 875, the Citizens again defended them&s;elves &s;toutly again&s;t the <HI>Danes,</HI> who came upon them by Sea, but landed, and formed a Camp on the North-&s;ide thereof, in a Place called <HI>Danes-ca&s;tle</HI> to this Day, where their Trenches are yet to be &s;een.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Town held out for a Month, again&s;t <HI>Swain</HI> King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and was at la&s;t taken by Treachery.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="321" REF="328">6. When <HI>William the Conqueror</HI> came again&s;t it, the Citizens defended them&s;elves until a Part of the City Wall fell down.</P>
<P N="7">7. The loyal Town&s;men took Part with <HI>Maud</HI> (their undoubted Sovereign) again&s;t King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and were at la&s;t reduced by Famine.</P>
<P N="8">8. In 1469, the Earl of <HI>Devon</HI> came before it in behalf of the then rightful Claimant King <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. and the Citizens delivered it up, &s;ending away the Lords and others of the <HI>Lanca&s;trian</HI> Party to <HI>Calais.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. They &s;hew'd their Loyalty to King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. by defending the Town again&s;t <HI>Perkin Warbeck,</HI> the Pretender of that Time. In Te&s;timony whereof, that King gave them the Sword and Cap; which <HI>Regalia</HI> are no &s;mall Part of their Pomp, to this Day.</P>
<P N="10">10. The rebellious Commons of <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Cornwall</HI> met with a very &s;tout Re&s;i&s;tance here, and tho' grievou&s;ly pinched with Famine, the Town held it out until the 6th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI>; when they were relieved by the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el.</HI> In Memory of which that is &s;till a Gaudy-day, and a Sermon is preached yearly on the Occa&s;ion, by the Mayor's Chaplain.</P>
<P N="11">11. In the grand Rebellion it was twice be&s;ieged, and held out for the Royal Cau&s;e until the King's Affairs grew every-where de&s;perate. And as &s;oon as General <HI>Monk</HI> appeared in Oppo&s;ition to the illegal Powers, the Citizens a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves, and de|clared for a free Parliament.</P>
<P N="12">12. When the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> landed at <HI>Torbay,</HI> and &s;ent a Detachment to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this City, the Inhabitants received them but coldly; and tho' they knew them&s;elves incapable of making any Re&s;i&s;tance, and were as &s;en&s;ible as other Parts of the Kingdom, of the Danger they were in from arbitrary Power; yet were they very tender of
<PB N="322" REF="329">
joining in any Affair that might be con&s;trued a Rebellion to their lawful Prince.</P>
<P>To the Account of Religious Hou&s;es, and Lands formerly appropriated thereto, let me add here, the Priory of <HI>Pole&s;loe,</HI> and that of <HI>Cowick,</HI> each of them but one Mile from <HI>Exeter</HI>; at a greater Di&s;tance, (but mu&s;t be mentioned here, or not at all) <HI>Canons-leigh, Canons-Teing, Indio</HI>; and larger than either of the&s;e, the Abbey of <HI>Buckfa&s;tleigh,</HI> Part of who&s;e Ruins are yet to be &s;een, and not one In&s;tance is there among&s;t them all, that contradicts my former Ob&s;ervations in relation to the Goodne&s;s of the Soil.</P>
<P>Near the Mouth of the River <HI>Exe,</HI> on the We&s;t Banks thereof, is <HI>Powderham-ca&s;tle,</HI> now, and for many Ages pa&s;t, the Seat of a Family of <HI>Courtenays,</HI> De&s;cendants from the Earl of <HI>Devon</HI> of that Name. This Seat, built in the manner of a Ca&s;tle, is a very grand Piece of Antiquity; and was the Work of <HI>I&s;abel,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Baldwin de Rivers,</HI> and Widow of <HI>William de Fortibus,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> III.</P>
<P><HI>Halldown</HI> is a pretty large, dry, heathy Common of about Seven Miles in Length, and about Three in Breadth, which, tho' &s;eparated by &s;ome inclo&s;ed Grounds of a pretty good Nature, &s;eems to be the &s;ame Vein of Land, of which the Fore&s;t of <HI>Dart|more,</HI> and the downy Part of <HI>A&s;hburton, Il&s;ington, Bridford, &amp;c.</HI> con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>On the North, and quite home to the Brink of this Down, is that rich Track of Land which I have already de&s;cribed, as Part of the mo&s;t fertile Soil in this County.</P>
<P>Tho' this Down is in it&s;elf a very flinty barren Soil; yet is its Situation &s;o delightful, the open Pro&s;pect, both by Sea and Land, &s;o engaging, and the whole Circuit thereof &s;o adapted to rural Re|creations, that the like Number of Gentlemens Seats as lie round the Skirts thereof within &s;o little
<PB N="323" REF="330">
Compa&s;s of Ground, are not to be met with at any Place that I know of, &s;ave only about <HI>London</HI>; which is not only a Confirmation of what I have ob&s;erved, but a very great Addition to the Delight ari&s;ing from the large Extent of the View.</P>
<P>And here it cannot be foreign to my Subject to in&s;ert the Names of tho&s;e genteel Habitations, and that of their &s;everal worthy Owners and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>

<P><HI>Exeter</HI> is particularly famous for two Things, which we &s;eldom find united in the &s;ame Town; <HI>viz.</HI> That it is full of Gentry, and yet full of Trade and Manufactures.</P>
<P>The Serge-market held here every Week, is very well worth a Stranger's &s;eeing, and, next to the <HI>Brigg Market</HI> at <HI>Leeds</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> is the greate&s;t in <HI>England.</HI> The People a&s;&s;ured me, that at this Market is generally &s;old from 60 to 70 to 80, and &s;ometimes a Hundred thou&s;and Pounds Value in Serges in a Week.</P>
<P>The <HI>Exe,</HI> or <HI>E&s;k,</HI> is a very con&s;iderable River, and the principal in the whole County, and by the Contrivance we have mentioned, Ships of 150 Tons now come up to the City.</P>
<P><HI>Exeter</HI> drives a very great Corre&s;pondence with <HI>Holland,</HI> as al&s;o directly to <HI>Portugal, Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI>; &s;hipping off va&s;t Quantities of their Woollen Manufactures, e&s;pecially to <HI>Holland,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> giving very large Commi&s;&s;ions here for the buying of Serges, Perpetuanas, and &s;uch Goods; which are made not only in and about <HI>Exeter,</HI> but at <HI>Crediton, Honiton, Culliton, St. Mary Ottery, Newton-bu&s;hell, A&s;hburton,</HI> and e&s;pecially at <HI>Tiverton, Cullumpton, Bampton,</HI> and all the North-ea&s;t Part of the County; which Part is, as it may be &s;aid, fully imploy'd, the People made rich, and the Poor well maintained by it. Some are of Opinion, however, that <HI>Exeter</HI> has of late Years vi&s;ibly dimini&s;hed in its Trade, &s;ome Part of which has, it is &s;aid, removed it&s;elf to other Quarters.</P>
<P>On the North-&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, (and which was formerly its Counter&s;carp) is a very beautiful Terrace-walk, bounded by a double Row of fine Elms, and extended round one Quarter of the City; <HI>viz.</HI> from the Ea&s;t-gate to the North-gate. This, for the
<PB N="325" REF="332">

<P>I &s;hall take the North Part of this County in my Return from <HI>Cornwall</HI>; &s;o I mu&s;t now lean to the South-coa&s;t, for in going on indeed we go South-we&s;t.</P>
<P>About 22 Miles from <HI>Exeter,</HI> and thro' <HI>Newtonbu&s;hel,</HI> a large, but meanly built Market-town, we go into the antient Town of <HI>Totne&s;s,</HI> on the River <HI>Dart.</HI> It was formerly of great Note, and &s;till is a pretty good Town, and has &s;ome Trade, but has more Gentlemen in it than Trade&s;men of Note: they have a very fine Stone Bridge here over the River, which being within 7 or 8 Miles of the Sea, is very large, and the Tide flows 10 or 12 Feet at the Bridge. Here we had the Diver&s;ion of &s;eeing them catch Fi&s;h, with the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a Dog; in this manner: On the South Side of the River, and on a Slip, or narrow Cut or Chanel made on purpo&s;e, &s;tands a Corn-mill; the Mill-tail, or Floor for the Water below the Wheels, is wharfed up on either Side with Stone, above High-water Mark, and for above 20 or 30 Feet in Length below it, on that Part of the River toward the Sea.
<PB N="327" REF="334">
At the End of this Wharfing is a Grating of Wood, the Cro&s;s Bars of which &s;tand bearing inward, &s;harp at the End, and pointing towards one another, as the Wires of a Mou&s;e-trap.</P>
<P>When the Tide flows up, the Fi&s;h can with Ea&s;e go in between the Points of the&s;e Cro&s;s-bars, but the Mill being &s;hut down, they can go no farther upwards; and when the Water ebbs again, are left behind, not being able to pa&s;s the Points of the Grating, which like a Mou&s;e-trap keeps them in; &s;o that they are left at the Bottom with about a Foot, or a Foot and half Water. We were carry'd hither at Low-water, where we &s;aw about 50 or 60 &s;mall Salmon, from 17 to 20 Inches long, which the Coun|try-people call <HI>Salmon Peal</HI>; and to catch the&s;e, they throw in a Net on a Hoop at the End of a Pole, the Pole going cro&s;s the Hoop, which, in &s;ome Places, they call a Shove Net. The Net being fix'd at one End of the Place, they put in a Dog, who is taught his Trade before-hand, at the other End, and he drives all the Fi&s;h into the Net; &s;o that only holding the Net &s;till in its Place, the Man took up Two or Three-and-thirty Salmon Peal at the fir&s;t time.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e we had Six for our Dinner, for which they a&s;k'd a Shilling only; and for &s;uch &s;iz'd Fi&s;h, and not &s;o fre&s;h, I have &s;een 6<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> each given at a <HI>London</HI> Fi&s;h-market, whither they are &s;ometimes brought from <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> by Land-Carriage. They have al&s;o delicate Trouts here.</P>
<P>This exce&s;&s;ive Plenty of &s;o good Fi&s;h, (other Provi&s;ions being cheap in Proportion) makes the Town of <HI>Totne&s;s</HI> a very good Place to live in; e&s;pe|cially for &s;uch as have large Families, and but &s;mall E&s;tates; and many &s;uch are &s;aid to come into tho&s;e Parts on purpo&s;e for &s;aving Money.</P>
<P>This Town made it&s;elf remarkable for the Ad|dre&s;s of the Inhabitants to King <HI>George</HI> I. on the Union of the Emperor and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> by the
<PB N="328" REF="335">
Treaty of <HI>Vienna</HI>: they profe&s;s'd their Zeal and Loyalty to his Per&s;on; and when the good Town of <HI>Totne&s;s</HI> had but a very in&s;ignificant Share of Pro|perty, a&s;&s;ur'd the King of their Readine&s;s to grant not only 4<HI>s.</HI> a Pound Land-tax, but to give into the Bargain the other 16<HI>s.</HI> if his Maje&s;ty's Service requir'd it; together with &s;everal other extravagant Declarations of Zeal and O&s;tentation, which made them the Subject of Ridicule all over the Kingdom, for being &s;o lavi&s;h in their Profe&s;&s;ions, when, as a Corporation, they had little or nothing to give.</P>
<P>About Ten Miles North of <HI>Totne&s;s,</HI> lies <HI>A&s;hbur|ton,</HI> a good Market-town, and Thoroughfare from <HI>Exeter</HI> to <HI>Plymouth.</HI> This is one of the Four Stan|nary Towns for the County of <HI>Devon,</HI> and lies but a little Way in from the Fore&s;t of <HI>Dartmore.</HI> The principal Trade of this Town, and indeed all the Towns and Villages in the whole County, is in the Woollen Manufacture.</P>
<P>The Three other Stannary Towns are <HI>Tavi&s;tock, Plympton,</HI> and <HI>Chagford,</HI> the la&s;t of which is a very poor incon&s;iderable Place, and neither that nor <HI>Plympton</HI> are capable of entertaining the Suitors, if the Lord Warden &s;hould be ever inclined to ad|journ the Court thither.</P>
<P>And now having mentioned this Court of Stan|nary, it may not be improper to give a further De|&s;cription thereof.</P>
<P>By divers Charters granted to the Tinners by King <HI>Edward</HI> I. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Court is to be held at <HI>Crockeren Torr,</HI> a noted Hill and Rock in the mid|dle of the Fore&s;t, far di&s;tant from any Hou&s;e: the Lord Warden of the Stannaries is the Judge of this Court, on who&s;e Summons the Jurors appear, who are generally Gentlemen within the Juri&s;|diction. I had my Information from a Gentleman, who, if I mi&s;take not, told me he had &s;erved as a Juror; and that when the Earl of <HI>Bath</HI> was Lord
<PB N="329" REF="336">
Warden, and held a Court there, he was attended by 300 Gentlemen well mounted.</P>
<P>At this de&s;olate Place (where no Refre&s;hment is to be had, but what the Company bring with them, no Shelter from the Weather, nor any thing to &s;it upon, but a Moor-&s;tone Bench) the Court is called: but then the next Act of the Steward is to adjourn to one of the Stannary Towns, (u&s;ually <HI>Tavi&s;tock)</HI> and the Company immediately makes the be&s;t of their Way thither.</P>
<P>At this Court, in former Times, when the Tin Mines in this County were in a flouri&s;hing State, a great deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s was di&s;patched; the Price of the Tin was fix'd, Differences in relation to the Works adju&s;ted, and Acts made for Regulation of every thing relating thereto. Several Pre&s;entments of the Jurors are printed, and this Meeting is vulgarly called, <HI>The Parliament for the Stannaries</HI>; the Place of Meeting in the Fore&s;t, <HI>The Parliament Hou&s;e</HI>; and the Pre&s;entment of the Jurors, <HI>Acts of Parlia|ment.</HI></P>
<P>The Abbey of <HI>Tavi&s;tock,</HI> the Priory at <HI>Plympton,</HI> and the Mona&s;tery at <HI>Buckland Monachorum,</HI> were very large Endowments; and their Scite well e&s;ta|bli&s;hes the Ob&s;ervation I have &s;everal times before made, in relation to the Fertility of the Soil where tho&s;e Orders of Men generally &s;eated them&s;elves. An Ob&s;ervation, I have made rather to confirm that of other Writers, than as Matter of Wonder or Reflection; for would it not be &s;trange, if the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;ticks &s;hould not be as capable of chu&s;ing for them&s;elves as other People? or that they &s;hould chu&s;e the wor&s;t, if they might have the be&s;t?</P>
<P>At <HI>Tavi&s;tock</HI> I &s;aw &s;ome &s;tately Remains of that grand Building; and among other things, part of the Butments of the Arch of a Bridge over the <HI>Tavy,</HI> which the Inhabitants call <HI>Guile-bridge,</HI> and relate the following Story; <HI>viz.</HI> That one <HI>Childe,</HI> Owner
<PB N="330" REF="337">
of the Manor of <HI>Plym&s;tock,</HI> made his Will, and gave the &s;aid Lands to the Church where his Body &s;hould be buried; and that afterwards, hunting in the Fore&s;t, he lo&s;t his Company and his Way, and tho', as his la&s;t Shift, he kill'd his Hor&s;e, and got into the warm Belly of him, he at length died there with the Extremity of Cold. The Body, after &s;ome Search, was found by the <HI>Tavi&s;toch</HI> Men, (who had, by &s;ome means, come to the Knowledge of his Will) and by them carried away towards their Abbey. The <HI>Plym&s;tock</HI> Men, hearing thereof, lay in Ambu&s;h for them at a Bridge, where they appre|hended they mu&s;t pa&s;s: but in this they were de|ceived; for the Prie&s;ts built a &s;light Bridge on Pur|po&s;e, over which they carried the Corps; by which Statagem they obtain'd the &s;aid Land; and hence, &s;ays the Tradition, this is called <HI>Guile-bridge.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Totne&s;s</HI> we went &s;till South about Seven Miles (all in View of the River) to <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> a Town of Note, &s;eated at the Mouth of the River <HI>Dart,</HI> where it empties it&s;elf into the Sea, at a very narrow, but &s;afe Entrance. The Opening into <HI>Dartmouth Harbour</HI> is not broad, but the Chanel deep enough for the bigge&s;t Ship in the Royal Navy: The Sides of the Entrance are high mounded with Rocks; without which, ju&s;t at the fir&s;t Narrowing of the Pa&s;&s;age, &s;tands a good &s;trong Fort beyond a Platform of Guns, which commands the Port.</P>
<P>The narrow Entrance is not much above half a Mile, and then it opens and makes a Ba&s;in, or Har|bour, able to receive 500 Sail of Ships, where they may ride with the greate&s;t Safety, and the Entrance may be chain'd up on Occa&s;ion. I went out in a Boat to view this Entrance, and the Ca&s;tle or Fort that commands it; and coming back with the Tide of Flood, I ob&s;erv'd &s;ome &s;mall Fi&s;h to &s;kip and play upon the Surface of the Water; upon which I a&s;k'd, What Fi&s;h they were? Immediately one of the
<PB N="331" REF="338">
Rowers or Seamen &s;tarted up in the Boat, and throw|ing his Arms abroad, as if he had been mad, cries out as loud as he could bawl, <HI>A Scool! a Scool!</HI> The Word was taken on the Shore as ha&s;tily as it would have been on Land, if he had cry'd Fire; and by that Time we reach'd the Quays, the Town was all in a kind of an Uproar.</P>
<P>The Matter was, that a great <HI>Shoal,</HI> or, as they call it, a <HI>Scool</HI> of Pilchards, came &s;wimming with the Tide, directly out of the Sea into the Harbour. The Boat-owner lamented his being unprepared for them; for he &s;aid, that if he could but have had a Day or two's Warning, he might have taken 200 Tun of them; in &s;hort, nobody was ready for them, ex|cept a &s;mall Fi&s;hing-boat or Two; one of which went into the Middle of the Harbour, and at Two or Three Hawls took about 40,000.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erv'd, that beyond the Mouth of the Har|bour was a whole Army of Porpoi&s;es, which, it &s;eems, pur&s;u'd the&s;e Pilchards, and, 'tis probable, drove them into the Harbour. The <HI>Scool</HI> drove up the River a great Way, even as high as <HI>Totne&s;s</HI> Bridge, as we heard afterwards; &s;o that the Country-people, who had Boats and Nets, caught as many as they knew what to do with.</P>
<P><HI>Dartmouth</HI> is &s;ituated on the We&s;t-&s;ide of this Ba|&s;in, or Harbour, in a kind of a Semicircle, on the A&s;cent of a &s;teep Hill, which, tho' large and popu|lous, is but meanly built; yet the Quay is large, and the Street before it &s;pacious. Here live &s;ome very flouri&s;hing Merchants, who trade very pro&s;perou&s;ly, and to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable trading Ports of <HI>Spain, Portugal, Italy,</HI> and the Plantations; but e&s;pecially to <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> with Fi&s;h; and they drive a good Trade al&s;o in their own Fi&s;hery of Pilchards, which is hereabouts car|ried on with the greate&s;t Number of Ve&s;&s;els of any Port in the We&s;t, except <HI>Falmouth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="339"><HI>Dartmouth,</HI> like other Towns in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> is full of Di&s;&s;enters, who have here a very large Meet|ing-hou&s;e. The <HI>French</HI> burnt it in <HI>Richard</HI> I.'s Time, and attempted it afterwards, but were bravely re|pul&s;ed, and chiefly by the Women, who fought de|&s;perately, and took Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ca&s;tel,</HI> their General, Three Lords, and Twenty-three Knights Pri&s;oners, and made a great Slaughter among them be&s;ides; but how this glorious Action fell to the Share of the Women, and whether the Men were inactive, or ab&s;ent, is not mentioned.</P>
<P>A little to the Southward of this Town, and to the Ea&s;t of the Port, is <HI>Torbay,</HI> a very good Road for Ships, about Twelve Miles in Circuit, tho' &s;ometimes, e&s;pecially with a Southerly or South-ea&s;t Wind, Ships have been obliged to quit the Bay, and put out to Sea, or run into <HI>Dartmouth</HI> for Shelter.</P>
<P>In the Bottom of this Bay is a beautiful, well-built, and finely-&s;ituated Hou&s;e, call'd <HI>Torr-Abbey,</HI> for|merly a Religious Hou&s;e; but now the Inheritance of <HI>&mdash; Cary,</HI> E&s;q. <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> is &s;aid to have landed here, when he came to attack <HI>Arviragus,</HI> King of <HI>Britain.</HI> And here it was that King <HI>William</HI> III. enter'd with a Fleet of 6000 Tran&s;ports, and 50 Sail of Men of War, under the Conduct of Admiral <HI>Herbert,</HI> &s;ince Lord <HI>Torrington.</HI></P>
<P>About Three Miles to the We&s;t of <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> is a little Fi&s;hing-town, call'd <HI>Brixham,</HI> remarkable for a Spring of Water, that ebbs and flows very &s;en&s;i|bly; a De&s;cription of which may not be unacceptable, e&s;pecially as the Account I give of it is the Re&s;ult of my own Ob&s;ervations; for I had &s;o much Patience as to &s;it by it for Fourteen Hours together, and carefully ob&s;erve its Periods, and the Quantity of its ebbing and flowing.</P>
<P>The Situation of this Spring is pretty near the Foot of a large Ridge of Hills, and the Quantity of Wa|ter that flows from it is con&s;iderable. It falls into
<PB N="333" REF="340">
a large Ba&s;in, where it is very ea&s;y to ob&s;erve (by lying in an inclining Plain) the perpendicular Height of its Ebbing and Flowing, as well as the Time be|tween high and low Water.</P>
<P>By a careful Ob&s;ervation of a great Number of Fluxes and Refluxes, I find, that when it proceeds regularly, (as it does &s;ometimes for Eight Hours to|gether) it is Eleven times in an Hour: for thus the 10th of <HI>July</HI> 1733, I ob&s;erv'd it high Water at 8^h. 31&prime; in the Morning, and continued to ob&s;erve it until 3^h. 3&prime; in the Afternoon; in which Interval of Seven Hours it had ebb'd and flow'd exactly Seventy-&s;even times.</P>
<P>There happens &s;ometimes an Intermi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Ebbings and Flowings; for in the Morning of the &s;ame Day, I ob&s;erv'd that from 6^h. 37&prime;, to 6^h. 58&prime;, it had no Motion at all; and at another time I found it to intermit for an Hour, or more.</P>
<P>The Ba&s;in which receives the Water, contains, as I gue&s;s, about Twenty Feet in Area; and the per|pendicular Height of the Flowing, when I ob&s;erv'd it, (which was in the Middle of Summer, and at a dry Sea&s;on) was various, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ometimes an Inch and three Quarters, and at other times not above half an Inch; but generally about one Inch and one Eighth.</P>
<P>The Reader will be rather plea&s;ed with this De|&s;cription, as it may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, confirm that ingenious, and very probable Hypothe&s;is, which was read by Dr. <HI>Atwell</HI> before the Royal Society, and is publi&s;h'd in their Tran&s;actions, touching reci|procating Springs; and of this (which is called <HI>Lay-well</HI>) in particular.</P>
<P>From <HI>Dartmouth</HI> we went to <HI>Plympton</HI> before-mentioned, as a poor Town, though it was formerly of great Account, and the Glory of the antient Earls of <HI>Devon,</HI> where are Tenures at this Day, called <HI>Ca&s;tle-guard,</HI> for defending and repairing the Walls of the Ca&s;tle, which however is now in Ruins. From
<PB N="334" REF="341">
thence the Road lies to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> Di&s;tance about Six Miles.</P>
<P><HI>Plymouth</HI> is indeed a Town of Con&s;ideration and Importance. The Situation of it is between Two very large Inlets of the Sea, and in the Bottom of a large Sound or Bay, which is incompa&s;s'd on every Side with Hills, and the Shore generally &s;teep and rocky, tho' the Anchorage is good, and it is pretty &s;afe Ride|ing. In the Entrance to this Bay, lies a large and mo&s;t dangerous Rock, which at High-water is co|ver'd, but at Low-tide lies bare, where many a good Ship has been lo&s;t, when they have thought all their Dangers at an End.</P>
<P>Upon this Rock, which was called the <HI>Eddy&s;tone,</HI> from its Situation, the ingenious Mr. <HI>Win&s;tanley,</HI> whom I have mention'd before, <HI>p.</HI> 107. undertook to build a Light-hou&s;e for the Direction of Sailors, and with great Art and Expedition fini&s;h'd it: which Work, con&s;idering its Height, the Magnitude of its Building, and the little Hold there was to fa&s;ten it to the Rock, &s;tood to Admiration, and bore out many a bitter Storm.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Win&s;tanley</HI> often vi&s;ited, and frequently &s;trengthen'd the Building by new Works; and was &s;o confident of its Firmne&s;s and Stability, that he u&s;ually &s;aid, to tho&s;e who doubted its Standing in hard Weather, that he only de&s;ir'd to be in it, when a Storm &s;hould happen.</P>
<P>But in the dreadful Tempe&s;t of <HI>Nov.</HI> 27. 1703, when he happen'd to be &s;o unhappy as to have his Wi&s;h, he would fain have been on Shore, making Signals for Help; but no Boats dur&s;t go off to him; and in the Morning after the Storm, nothing was to be &s;een but the bare Rock, the Light-hou&s;e being gone, in which Mr. <HI>Win&s;tanley,</HI> and all that were with him, peri&s;h'd; and a few Days after, a Merchant's Ship, call'd the <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> Homeward-bound from <HI>Virginia,</HI> not knowing the Light-hou&s;e was down,
<PB N="335" REF="342">
ran foul of the Rock, and was lo&s;t with all her Lade|ing, and mo&s;t of her Men: but there is now another Light-hou&s;e built on the &s;ame Rock by the Corpo|ration of <HI>Trinity-hou&s;e,</HI> in Pur&s;uance of an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the Fifth of Queen <HI>Anne.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>Plymouth</HI> lies in the Bottom of this <HI>Sound,</HI> in the Centre between the Two Waters, &s;o there lies again&s;t it, in the &s;ame Po&s;ition, an I&s;land which they call <HI>St. Nicolas,</HI> on which is a Ca&s;tle that commands the Entrance into <HI>Ham-Ouze,</HI> and indeed that al&s;o into <HI>Catwater</HI> in &s;ome Sort. On the Shore, over-again&s;t this I&s;land, is the Citadel of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> a &s;mall, but regular Fortification, inacce&s;&s;ible by Sea, but not ex|ceeding &s;trong by Land; except that they &s;ay the Works are of a Stone hard as Marble, and would not &s;oon yield to the Batteries of an Enemy: but that is a Language our modern Engineers laugh at. It is &s;urrounded with a deep Trench, out of which was dug the Stone that built the whole Citadel, which is about three Quarters of a Mile in Circumference, and has 300 great Guns on its Walls, which &s;tand thicke&s;t towards the Sea. Several Guns are al&s;o planted on part of the old Fort, lying almo&s;t level with the Water, all which gives the greate&s;t Security to the Ships in the Harbour.</P>
<P>The Town &s;tands above the Citadel, upon the &s;ame Rock, and lies &s;loping on the Side of it, towards the Ea&s;t, the Inlet of the Sea (which is call'd <HI>Catwater,</HI> and is a Harbour capable of receiving any Number of Ships, and of any Size) wa&s;hing the Ea&s;tern Shore of the Town, where they have a kind of natural Mole, or Haven, with a Quay, and all other Con|veniencies for bringing in Ve&s;&s;els for loading and un|loading; nor is the Trade carried on here incon&s;i|derable in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The other Inlet of the Sea, as I term it, is on the other Side of the Town, and is cal'd <HI>Ham-Ouze,</HI> being the Mouth of the River <HI>Tamar,</HI> a con&s;iderable
<PB N="336" REF="343">
River, which parts the Two Counties of <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Cornwall.</HI> Here the War with <HI>France</HI> making it nece&s;&s;ary, that the Ships of War &s;hould have a Re|treat nearer Hand than at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> the late King <HI>William</HI> order'd a wet Dock, with Yards, dry Docks, Launches, and Conveniencies of all kinds for build|ing and repairing of Ships, to be built. The&s;e wet and dry Docks are about Two Miles up the <HI>Ham-Ouze,</HI> and for the Neatne&s;s and Excellency of the Work, exceed all that were ever built of the Kind, being hewn out of a Mine of Slate, and lin'd with <HI>Portland</HI> Stone. The dry Dock is built after the Mould of a Fir&s;t-rate Man of War, and the wet Dock will contain Five of the &s;ame Bigne&s;s. What follow'd the&s;e, as it were of Cour&s;e, was the Build|ing of Store-hou&s;es and Ware-hou&s;es for the Rigging, Sails, naval and military Stores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of &s;uch Ships as may be appointed to be laid up there, with very hand&s;ome Hou&s;es for the Commi&s;&s;ioners, Clerks, and Officers of all kinds u&s;ual in the King's Yards, to dwell in. It is, in &s;hort, now become as com|plete an Ar&s;enal, or Yard, for building and fitting out Men of War, as any the Government are Ma|&s;ters of; and perhaps much more convenient than &s;ome of them, tho' not &s;o large; and this has occa|&s;ion'd a proportional Increa&s;e of Buildings to the Town.</P>
<P>Here are Two fine Churches, and Two or Three Meeting-hou&s;es for Di&s;&s;enters, and <HI>French</HI> Refugees; as al&s;o a Free-&s;chool, and an Ho&s;pital for Blue-coat Boys.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to this Place, on the other Side <HI>Ham-Ouze,</HI> is &s;ituated <HI>Mount Edgcumbe,</HI> the Seat of <HI>Richard Edgcumbe,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> deem'd one of the noble&s;t Pro&s;pects in <HI>England</HI>; overlooking at once the Sea, the Har|bour, Citadel, and Town of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and the County adjacent for a great Way.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Carew</HI> publi&s;h'd, in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> I. a very judicious Survey of this County, dedicated to Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh.</HI> The Reader may there inform him&s;elf, in a very particular manner, of its Natural Hi&s;tory, and the Produce, Cu&s;toms, and Rarities, which it abounds with. Among other Cu|rio&s;ities, he may there find complete Li&s;ts of the Knights Fees, Barons, Knights, and Men at Arms, together with the Survey of the Acres taken by <HI>So|lomon de Roff,</HI> and his Fellows, Ju&s;tices itinerant, at <HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> I. by which Survey it appears, that this County contain'd, at that Time, 5555 Acres; and the Author tells us, that a <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Acre, or one fourth Part of a Knight's Fee, contained Nine Farthings Land, each of which was, as he thinks, about Thirty of our Statute Acres. If all this be true, then that County con|tained, at that time, One million and Five hundred thou&s;and Acres, which is more, by one Third, than it is now e&s;timated to be, and doth, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, &s;trengthen the Conjecture, that a great Part of the Land on this Coa&s;t is devoured by the Sea, and that the <HI>Scilly</HI> Rocks were formerly a Part of the Land, tho' now Ten Leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Among the natural Productions of this County, ought not to be omitted their Slate, the be&s;t in <HI>Europe</HI> for covering of Hou&s;es; the <HI>Moor-&s;tone,</HI> which, by a very laborious Poli&s;hing, (a Matter very lately attempted) equals in Beauty the <HI>Egyptian Granate.</HI> I take no Notice of the Gold, Silver, Copper, Tin, Lead; the Marble, Agat, Coral,
<PB N="338" REF="345">
and even Diamonds, which are here found, becau&s;e the&s;e have been ob&s;erv'd by all who mention the Productions of this We&s;tern County; and for the &s;ame Rea&s;on &s;hall omit the manner of their working their Mines, and refining the Ore.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants have been remarkable for their Strength of Body; witne&s;s, among numberle&s;s others, <HI>John Bray,</HI> who carried on his Back Six Bu&s;hels of Meal, of Fifteen Gallons to the Bu&s;hel, and the Miller, a Man of Twenty-four Years of Age, on the Top of it; al&s;o <HI>John Roman,</HI> who carried, at one time, the whole Carca&s;e of an Ox.</P>
<P><HI>Salta&s;h</HI> &s;eems to be the Ruins of a larger Place, it is govern'd by a Mayor and Aldermen, has many Privileges, &s;ends Members to Parliament, has the &s;ole Oy&s;ter-Fi&s;hing in the whole River, which is con&s;iderable. It has al&s;o Juri&s;diction upon the Ri|ver <HI>Tamar,</HI> down to the Mouth of the Port, &s;o that they claim Anchorage of all &s;mall Ships, that enter the River: their Coroner &s;its upon all Bodies that are found drown'd in the River, and the like. Here is a good Market, and it is very much benefited by the Increa&s;e of the Inhabitants of <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI> as lying near the Dock at the Mouth of <HI>Ham-Oze</HI>; for tho&s;e People choo&s;e rather to go to <HI>Salta&s;h</HI> to Market by Water, than to walk to <HI>Plymouth</HI> by Land for their Provi&s;ions: becau&s;e, fir&s;t, as they go in the Town-boat, the &s;ame Boat brings home what they buy, &s;o that it is much le&s;s Trouble; &s;econdly, becau&s;e Provi&s;ions are bought much cheaper at <HI>Sal|ta&s;h</HI> than at <HI>Plymouth:</HI> and of late, they have &s;ome Ships that u&s;e the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>There is no other Town up the <HI>Tamar,</HI> till we come to <HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> the County Town, which I &s;hall take in my Return, except <HI>Kellington,</HI> a pretty good Market and Portreve Town, where is a good Market-hou&s;e, and a neat Church, which, as well as the other Buildings in the Town, are in good Con|dition;

<P>From <HI>Salta&s;h</HI> I went to <HI>Le&s;kard,</HI> about Seven Miles. This is a con&s;iderable Town, well-built, has People of Fa&s;hion in it, and a very great Market: it is one of the Five Stannary Towns, and was once &s;till more eminent, and had a good Ca&s;tle, and a large Hou&s;e, where the antient Dukes of <HI>Cornwall</HI> kept their Court: it al&s;o enjoy'd &s;everal con&s;iderable Privileges, e&s;pecially by the Favour of the <HI>Black Prince,</HI> who, as Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> re&s;ided here: and in Return, they &s;ay, this Town, and the Country round it, rai&s;ed a great Body of &s;tout young Fellows, who entered into his Service, and followed his Fortunes in his Wars. But the&s;e Buildings are &s;o decay'd, that there are now &s;carce any of the Ruins of the Ca&s;tle, or of the Prince's Court, remaining. Here was al&s;o antiently a Chapel, much re&s;orted to by Pilgrims in Po|pi&s;h Times; and in the Town is a Fountain of very clear Water, to which many miraculous Cures were attributed.</P>
<P>It &s;till boa&s;ts of its <HI>Guild,</HI> or <HI>Town-hall,</HI> on which is a Turret with a fine Clock; a good Free-School, well provided; a very fine Conduit in the Market-place; an antient large Church, dedicated to St. <HI>Martin</HI>; and a large new-built <HI>Meeting-hou&s;e</HI> for the Di&s;&s;enters; which I name, becau&s;e they a&s;&s;ured me there were but Three more, and tho&s;e incon&s;iderable, in all the County of <HI>Cornwall</HI>; whereas in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> which is the next County, there are reckoned about 70, &s;ome of which are exceeding large and fine.</P>
<P>This Town is al&s;o remarkable for the Defeat of the Parliament Army by Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> and for a very great Trade in all Manfactures of Leather, &s;uch as Boots, Shoes, Gloves, Pur&s;es, Breeches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;ome Spinning of late Years is &s;et up here,

<P>Between the&s;e Two Towns of <HI>Salta&s;h</HI> and <HI>Leskard,</HI> is the Borough of <HI>St. Germans,</HI> now a Village, de|cay'd, and without any Market, but the large&s;t Pari&s;h in the whole County; in the Bounds of which are contained 17 Villages, and the Town of <HI>Salta&s;h</HI> among them; for <HI>Salta&s;h</HI> Church, it &s;eems, was but a Chapel of Ea&s;e to <HI>St. Germans.</HI> It has been antiently a Bi&s;hop's See, which was tran&s;lated from <HI>Bodmyn</HI> hither, and afterwards from <HI>St. Germans</HI> to <HI>Crediton,</HI> then one of the be&s;t Towns in the County, and thence to <HI>Exeter.</HI> This Town takes its Name from St. <HI>German,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Auxerre</HI> in <HI>Burgundy,</HI> who came over from <HI>France,</HI> to preach again&s;t the Here&s;y of <HI>Pelagius,</HI> which then began to &s;pread in <HI>England,</HI> and took up his Re&s;idence here. The Ruins of the Epi&s;copal Palace at <HI>Cuttenbeck,</HI> a Mile and half from the Town, which afterwards dwindled into a Farm-hou&s;e, are &s;till vi&s;ible. A Gentleman of the Name of <HI>Elliott</HI> was lately a great Benefactor to this Town, having endowed a publick School there, repaired the Se&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e, and beautify'd the Church; where he was buried, and has a fine <HI>Italian</HI> party-coloured Marble Monument erected to his Memory by his Widow. There is &s;till an Epi&s;copal Chair in the Church, and &s;everal other Seats belonging to Canons. The Town &s;tands on a ri&s;ing Ground, and is built in the Form of an Amphitheatre.</P>
<P>In the Neighbourhood of the&s;e Towns are many plea&s;ant Seats of <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Gentry, who are indeed very numerous, and the mo&s;t &s;ociable, generous, and kind Neighbours to one another that are to be found; and u&s;ually intermarry among them&s;elves; from whence, they &s;ay, the Proverb, <HI>That all the</HI> Corni&s;h <HI>Gentlemen are Cou&s;ins.</HI> It is the very &s;ame in <HI>Wales,</HI> where the greate&s;t Compliment that one Gentleman can make to another of the &s;ame County, is to call
<PB N="341" REF="348">
him Cou&s;in. There is a great Conformity of Man|ners, Cu&s;toms, and U&s;ages between the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> and <HI>Corni&s;h,</HI> who are accounted of the &s;ame Origin, and De&s;cendants al&s;o of the antient <HI>Britons</HI>; and there is likewi&s;e a great Affinity between the old <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> and <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Language.</P>
<P>On the Hills North of <HI>Leskard,</HI> and in the Way between that Town and <HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> are many Tin Mines, and &s;ome of the riche&s;t Veins of that Metal in the whole County; which when ca&s;t at the Blow|ing-hou&s;es into Blocks, are &s;ent to <HI>Leskard</HI> to be coined.</P>
<P>From <HI>Leskard,</HI> in our Cour&s;e We&s;t, we are ne|ce&s;&s;arily carried to the Sea-coa&s;t, becau&s;e of the River <HI>Fowey,</HI> which empties it&s;elf into the Sea, at a very large Mouth; and hereby, this River ri&s;ing in the Middle of the Breadth of the County, and run|ning South, and the River <HI>Camel</HI> ri&s;ing not far from it, and running North, with a like large Chanel, the Land from <HI>Bodmyn</HI> to the We&s;tern Part of the County, is almo&s;t made an I&s;land, and in a manner cut off from the Ea&s;tern; the I&s;thmus, or Neck of Land between, being not above Twelve Miles over.</P>
<P>In the Pari&s;h of <HI>St. Cleer</HI> is a Piece of Antiquity, which they call, <HI>The other Half-&s;tone,</HI> which are indeed Two Stones fixed in the Ground; and by Mortai&s;es in each, they &s;eem to have been heretofore joined together. Both of them were curiou&s;ly wrought by Diaper-work-carvings; but one of them hath an In&s;cription in very antique Characters, as follows:

<P>Not far di&s;tant is a Heap of large Stones, under which lies a great Stone, fa&s;hioned like a Chee&s;e, and &s;eems to the Eye, as if it were pre&s;s'd into that Form by the Weight that lies upon it; and hence they call it <HI>Wring-chee&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>On the South from <HI>Leskard</HI> we come to <HI>Foy,</HI> or <HI>Fowey,</HI> an antient Borough-town, and formerly very large and potent; for the <HI>Foyens,</HI> as they were then call'd, were able to fit out large Fleets, not only for Merchants Ships, but even of Men of War; and with the&s;e, not only fought with, but &s;everal times vanqui&s;hed and routed, the Squadron of the Cinque|port Men, who in tho&s;e Days were very powerful.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> ob&s;erves, that the Town of <HI>Foy</HI> quar|ters &s;ome Part of the Arms of every one of tho&s;e Cinque-ports with their own; intimating, that they had at &s;everal times triumph'd over them all: and indeed they were once &s;o powerful, that they fitted out their Fleets again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and took &s;everal of their Men of War, when they were at Variance with <HI>England,</HI> and enriching their Town by the Spoil of their Enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="350"><HI>Edward</HI> IV. favour'd them much; and becau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> threaten'd to come up their River with a powerful Navy to burn their Town, he cau&s;ed Two Forts to be built at the publick Charge, for its Security, the Ruins of which are &s;till to be &s;een: but the &s;ame King <HI>Edward</HI> was &s;ome time after &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted at the Town&s;men, for officiou&s;ly falling upon the <HI>French,</HI> after a Truce was proclaimed, that he effectually di&s;armed them, took away their whole Fleet, Ships, Tackle, Apparel and Furniture; and &s;ince that time we do not read of any of their Naval Exploits, nor that they ever attempted to recover their Strength at Sea. However, <HI>Foy,</HI> at this time. is a very fair Town; it lies extended on the Ea&s;t Sid, of the River, for above a Mile, the Buildings fair, and there are a great many flouri&s;hing Merchants in it, who have a great Share in the Fi&s;hing-trade, e&s;pe|cially for Pilchards. In this Town, is al&s;o a Coinage for the TIN, of which a great Quantity is dug up in the Country North and We&s;t of the Town. The Church at <HI>Fowey</HI> is antient, and very fine.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Fowey,</HI> which is very broad and deep here, was formerly very navigable by Ships of good Burden as high as the Borough-town of <HI>Le&s;twithiel,</HI> an antient, and once a flouri&s;hing, but now a decay'd Place, and as to Trade and Navigation quite de&s;ti|tute; which is occa&s;ioned by the River being filled up with Sand.</P>
<P><HI>Le&s;twithiel</HI> was called, in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Times, <HI>Pen Uehel Coed,</HI> i. e. an high Place with Wood. It be|came &s;ince the antient Re&s;idence of the Dukes of <HI>Cornwall.</HI> The Ruins of a Ca&s;tle belonging to them are &s;till to be &s;een, on a ri&s;ing Ground, at a little Di&s;tance from the Town. The Church is an hand|&s;ome Edifice; but the Steeple carries the Marks of the Civil Wars in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> I. when the great Hall and Exchequer of the &s;aid Dukes of <HI>Cornwall</HI> were al&s;o utterly defaced. Some &s;ay this
<PB N="344" REF="351">
Town was formerly the County Town and &s;till retains &s;everal Advantages which &s;upports its Figure; as, 1. That it is one of the Coinage or Stannary Towns. 2. The common Gaol for the whole Stan|nary is here, as are al&s;o the County Courts for <HI>Cornwall.</HI></P>
<P>There is a mock Cavalcade kept up at this Town, which is very remarkable; the Particulars, as they are related by Mr. <HI>Carew,</HI> in his <HI>Survey</HI> of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> take as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Upon little <HI>Ea&s;ter Sunday,</HI> the Freeholders of this Town and Manor, by them&s;elves, or their Deputies, did there a&s;&s;emble: among&s;t whom, one, (as it fell to his Lot by turn) bravely apparell'd, gallantly mounted, with a Crown on his Head, a Sceptre in his Hand, and a Sword borne before him, and dutifully attended by all the re&s;t, al&s;o on Hor&s;eback, rode thro' the principal Street to the Church: the Curate in his be&s;t <HI>Be&s;een</HI> &s;olemnly received him at the Church-yard Stile, and con|ducted him to hear Divine Service. After which, he repaired with the &s;ame Pomp to a Hou&s;e provided for that Purpo&s;e, made a Fea&s;t to his Attendants, kept the Table's-end him&s;elf, and was &s;erved with kneeling A&s;&s;ay, and all other Rights due to the E&s;tate of a Prince: with which Din|ner the Ceremony ended, and every Man re|turned Home again. The Pedigree of this U&s;age is deriv'd from &s;o many De&s;cents of Ages, that the Cau&s;e and Author out-reach Remembrance. Howbeit, the&s;e Circum&s;tances afford a Conjecture, that it &s;hould betoken Royalties appertaining to the Honour of <HI>Cornwall.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Behind <HI>Foy,</HI> and nearer to the Coa&s;t, at the Mouth of a &s;mall River, which &s;ome call <HI>Loe,</HI> tho' with|out any Authority, &s;tand Two Borough-towns op|po&s;ite to one another, bearing the Name of <HI>Ea&s;t Loe,</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Loe.</HI> The&s;e are both good trading
<PB N="345" REF="352">
Towns, and e&s;pecially for Fi&s;h; and, which is very particular, are, like <HI>Weymouth</HI> and <HI>Melcomb</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> &s;eparated only by the Creek or River; and yet each of them &s;ends Members to Parliament. The&s;e Towns are joined together by a very beauti|ful and &s;tately Stone Bridge, having 15 Arches.</P>
<P><HI>Ea&s;t Loe</HI> was the antienter Corporation of the Two, and &s;ome Ages ago the greater and more con&s;iderable Town; but now they tell us <HI>We&s;t Loe</HI> is the riche&s;t, and has the mo&s;t Ships belonging to it; but has neither Church or Chapel, nor Meeting-hou&s;e in it. Were they put together, they would make a very hand&s;ome Sea-port Town.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing from hence, and ferrying over <HI>Foy</HI> River, we come into a large Country without many Towns in it of Note, but very well furni&s;hed with Gentle|mens Seats, and a little higher up with Tin Works.</P>
<P>The Sea making &s;everal deep Bays here, they who travel by Land are obliged to go higher into the Country, to pa&s;s above the Water, e&s;pecially at <HI>Tre|wardreth-bay,</HI> which lies very broad, above Ten Miles within the Country; which pa&s;&s;ing at <HI>Tre|wardreth,</HI> a Town of no great Note, tho' the Bay takes its Name from it, the next Inlet of the Sea is the famous <HI>Firth,</HI> or Inlet, called <HI>Falmouth Haven.</HI> It is certainly, next to <HI>Milford Haven</HI> in <HI>South Wales,</HI> the faire&s;t and be&s;t Road for Shipping that is in the whole I&s;le of <HI>Britain</HI>; whether we con&s;ider the Depth of Water for above 20 Miles within Land; the Safety of Riding, &s;helter'd from all kind of Winds or Storms; the good Anchorage, and the many Creeks, all navigable, where Ships may run in and be &s;afe.</P>
<P>There are Six or Seven very con&s;iderable Places upon this <HI>Haven,</HI> and the Rivers from it: <HI>viz. Grampound, Tregony, Truro, Penryn, Falmouth, St. Mawes,</HI> and <HI>Pendennis.</HI> The Four fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;end Members to Parliament; altho' the Town of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> as big as all of them together, <HI>(Truro</HI> ex|cepted)
<PB N="346" REF="353">
and richer than Ten &s;uch, &s;ends none. But how &s;o con&s;iderable a Sea-port and Town, comes to be debarr'd that Privilege, doth not appear. 'Tis certain, that a great Number of &s;mall incon&s;iderable Boroughs in this County do now enjoy it; but until the 6th of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. none but <HI>Launce&s;ton, Leskard, Le&s;twithiel, Truro, Bodmyn, Hel&s;ton,</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;&s;iney,</HI> &s;ent any. And whether it were then im|po&s;ed on the re&s;t as a Puni&s;hment, or conferred as a Favour, is uncertain. I cannot agree with tho&s;e who think it was obtain'd at their Reque&s;t, by the Intere&s;t of their Duke, becau&s;e they were inve&s;ted with it by King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. and Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> when no Per&s;on bore that Title.</P>
<P><HI>St. Mawes,</HI> and <HI>Pendennis</HI> or <HI>Pen-dinas,</HI> (which &s;ignifies in the old <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> the End or Head of a City) are Two Fortifications placed at the Points, or Entrance, of this <HI>Haven,</HI> oppo&s;ite to one another, tho' not with a Communication or View. They are very &s;trong; the former principally by Sea, having a good Platform of Guns, pointing 'thwart the Cha|nel, and planted on a Level with the Water; but <HI>Pendennis</HI> Ca&s;tle is &s;trong by Land as well as by Water, is regularly fortified, has good Out-works, and generally a &s;trong Gari&s;on, and each of them has a Governor.</P>
<P><HI>St. Mawes,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s, has a Town annex'd to the Ca&s;tle, and is a Borough, &s;ending Members to Parliament; but has neither Church, Chapel, Meeting-hou&s;e, Fair, or Market, in it.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Falmouth</HI> is by much the riche&s;t, and be&s;t trading Town in this County, tho' not &s;o antient as its Neighbour Town of <HI>Truro</HI>; and in|deed, is in &s;ome things obliged to acknowlege its Seigniority, and the <HI>Truro</HI> Men receive &s;everal Du|ties collected in <HI>Falmouth</HI>; particularly Wharfage for the Merchandizes landed, or &s;hipped off: but the
<PB N="347" REF="354">
Town of <HI>Falmouth</HI> has gotten the Trade, at lea&s;t the be&s;t Part of it, from the other, which is chiefly owing to the Situation; for lying upon the Sea, but within the Entrance, Ships of the greate&s;t Bur|den come up to the very Quay, and the whole Royal Navy might ride &s;afely in the Road; whereas the Town of <HI>Truro,</HI> lying far within, and at the Mouth of Two fre&s;h Rivers, is not navigable for Ve&s;&s;els of above 150 Tons, or thereabouts; the Trade at <HI>Truro</HI> being chiefly, if not altogether, for the Ship|ping off of Block TIN and COPPER Ore, the latter being lately found in large Quantities in &s;ome of the Mountains between <HI>Truro</HI> and <HI>St. Michael's,</HI> and which is much improv'd &s;ince the &s;everal Mills are erected at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and other Parts, for the Ma|nufactures of Battery-ware, as 'tis called.</P>
<P><HI>Falmouth</HI> is well-built, has abundance of Shipping belonging to it, is full of rich Merchants, and has an increa&s;ing Trade, becau&s;e of the &s;etting up of late Years the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Packets between this Port and <HI>Lisbon,</HI> which occa&s;ions a new Commerce between <HI>Portugal</HI> and this Town, amounting to a very great Value.</P>
<P>It is true, Part of this Trade was founded in a clande&s;tine Commerce, carried on by the &s;aid Packets at <HI>Lisbon</HI>; where being the King's Ships, and claim|ing the Privilege of not being &s;earched or vi&s;ited by the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers, they found Means to carry off great Quantities of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures, which they &s;old on Board to the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Mer|chants, and they convey'd them on Shore, as 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, without paying Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>But the Government there getting Intelligence of it, and Complaint being made in <HI>England</HI> al&s;o, where it was found to be prejudicial to the fair Mer|chant, that Trade has been effectually &s;topp'd; but the <HI>Falmouth</HI> Merchants, having by this means gotten a Ta&s;te of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Trade, have maintained it
<PB N="348" REF="355">
ever &s;ince in Ships of their own. The&s;e Packets bring over va&s;t Quantities of Gold in Specie, either in <HI>Moidores,</HI> or in Bars of Gold, on Account of the Merchants at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e for all the Towns in this Port, and the Head-collector, is e&s;tabli&s;hed at this Town, where the Duties, including tho&s;e of the other Ports, are very con&s;iderable. Here is al&s;o a very great Fi&s;h|ing for <HI>Pilchards,</HI> and the Merchants of <HI>Falmouth</HI> have the chiefe&s;t Stroke in that gainful Trade.</P>
<P><HI>Truro,</HI> tho' it gives Place to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> is however a con&s;iderable Town. It &s;tands up the Water North-and-by-ea&s;t from <HI>Falmouth,</HI> in the utmo&s;t extended Branch of the Haven, at the Conflux of Two Rivers, which, tho' not of any long Cour&s;e, have a very good Appearance for a Port, and make a large Wharf between them in the Front of the Town; and the Water here makes a very good Port for &s;mall Ships, tho' it be at the Influx, but not for Ships of Burden. There are at lea&s;t Three Churches in it, but no Di&s;&s;enters Meeting-hou&s;e, that I could hear of.</P>
<P><HI>Tregony,</HI> or <HI>Tregenen,</HI> (which in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ignifies the Mouth-town) is a Borough-town upon the &s;ame Water North-ea&s;t from <HI>Falmouth,</HI> di&s;tant about 16 Miles from it, but is a Town of very little Trade; nor indeed have any of the Towns &s;o far within the Shore, notwith&s;tanding the Benefit of the Water, any con&s;iderable Trade, but what is carried on under the Merchants of <HI>Falmouth</HI> or <HI>Truro.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Grampound</HI> is a Market-town and Borough, about Four Miles farther up the Water. This Place indeed has a Claim to Antiquity, and is an Appendix to the Duchy of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> of which it holds at a Free-farm Rent, and pays to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> as Duke, 10<HI>l.</HI> 11<HI>s.</HI> 1<HI>d. per Annum.</HI> It has no Pari&s;h-church, but only a Chapel of Ea&s;e to an adjacent Pari&s;h. Here are &s;ome Remains to be &s;een
<PB N="349" REF="356">
of the famous <HI>Coedfala,</HI> which, in the <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>Felon-wood,</HI> granted, with all the Lands in it, to the Town, in King <HI>Edward</HI> III.'s Time.</P>
<P><HI>Penryn,</HI> another Borough-town, is up the &s;ame Branch of the Haven as <HI>Falmouth,</HI> but &s;tands Four Miles higher towards the We&s;t, upon a Hill; yet Ships come to it of as great a Size as can come to <HI>Truro.</HI> It is a very plea&s;ant agreeable Town, and for that Rea&s;on has many Merchants in it, who would perhaps other|wi&s;e live at <HI>Falmouth.</HI> The chief Commerce of the&s;e Towns, as to their Sea-affairs, is the Pilchards, and <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Fi&s;hing, which is very profitable to them all. It had formerly a Conventual Church, with a Chantry, and a Religious Hou&s;e, a Cell to <HI>Kirton</HI>; but they are all demoli&s;hed, and &s;carce the Ruins of them di&s;tingui&s;hable enough to know one Part from another. This Town is full of Orchards, and looks like a Town in a Wood. The Sea em|braces it on each Side. Its Name is <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> as all tho&s;e Words beginning with <HI>Pen,</HI> and <HI>Tre,</HI> and <HI>Lan,</HI> (which occur often in this County) are.</P>
<P>Quitting <HI>Falmouth</HI> Haven, from <HI>Penryn</HI> We&s;t, we came to <HI>Hel&s;ton,</HI> another Borough-town, at about Seven Miles Di&s;tance: It &s;tands upon the little River <HI>Cober,</HI> which however admits the Sea &s;o into its Bo&s;om, as to make a tolerable good Harbour for Ships, a little below the Town. It is the Fifth Town allowed for the Coining TIN, and &s;everal of the Ships called <HI>Tin</HI> Ships are laden here.</P>
<P>This Town is large and populous, and has Four &s;pacious Streets, an hand&s;ome Church, and a good Trade. Beyond this is a Market-town, tho' of no Re&s;ort for Trade, called <HI>Market-Jew:</HI> it lies indeed on the Sea-&s;ide, but has no Harbour or &s;afe Road for Shipping.</P>
<P>At <HI>Helford</HI> is a &s;mall but good Harbour, between <HI>Falmouth</HI> and this Port, where many times the
<PB N="350" REF="357">
TIN Ships go in to load for <HI>London</HI>; al&s;o here are a good Number of Fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els for the <HI>Pilchard</HI> Trade, and abundance of &s;kilful Fi&s;hermen.</P>
<P><HI>Pen&s;ance,</HI> in <HI>Briti&s;h, Pen&s;and,</HI> i. e. the Head, or End of the Sand, is the farthe&s;t Town, of any Note, We&s;t, being 254 Miles from <HI>London,</HI> and within about Ten Miles of the Promontory called the <HI>Land's-end</HI>; &s;o that this Promontory is from <HI>London</HI> 264 Miles, or thereabouts. This is a Mar|ket-town of good Bu&s;ine&s;s, well-built and populous, has a good Trade, and a great many Ships belonging to it, notwith&s;tanding it is &s;o remote. Here are al&s;o a great many good Families of Gentlemen, tho' in this utmo&s;t Angle of the Nation: and, which is yet more &s;trange, the Veins of Lead, Tin, and Copper Ore, are &s;aid to be &s;een, even to the utmo&s;t Extent of Land at Low-water Mark, and in the very Sea. So rich, &s;o valuable a Trea&s;ure is contained in the&s;e Parts of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> tho' they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be very poor, becau&s;e &s;o remote from <HI>London,</HI> which is the Centre of our Wealth.</P>
<P>Between this Town and <HI>St. Burien,</HI> a Town midway between it and the <HI>Land's-end,</HI> &s;tands a circular Temple of the <HI>Druids,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of 19 Stones, the Di&s;tance between each being 12 Feet, and a 20th in the Centre, much higher than the re&s;t; and are not unlike tho&s;e at <HI>Stonehenge</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire.</HI> The Pari&s;h where they &s;tand is called <HI>Bi&s;card-woune,</HI> from whence the antient and now noble Family of <HI>Bo&s;|cawen</HI> derives its Name.</P>
<P>In <HI>Cleer</HI> Pari&s;h in this County, Six or Eight Stones of prodigious Bigne&s;s likewi&s;e &s;tand up in a Circle; a Monument of the like Nature.</P>
<P>The&s;e are probably, as tho&s;e at <HI>Stonehenge</HI> and <HI>Burien,</HI> Remains of <HI>Druids</HI> Temples.</P>
<P>And we &s;hall mention in this Place, that at <HI>Stanton|drew,</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> is another Temple of the <HI>Druids,</HI> called <HI>The Weddings.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="358">The <HI>Maen-amber,</HI> near this Town of <HI>Pen&s;ance,</HI> was al&s;o a very remarkable Stone, which, as Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> tells us, tho' it be of a va&s;t Bigne&s;s, yet might be moved with one Finger, notwith&s;tanding a great Number of Men could not remove it from its Place. It was de&s;troy'd, as one of the &s;ame Sort was in <HI>Fife&s;hire, Scotland,</HI> by one of <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Go|vernors: for the&s;e Reformers had a Notion of the&s;e Works being of a &s;uper&s;titious kind.</P>
<P><HI>Maen</HI> is a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word for a great Stone: There is one of the&s;e Stones, as Dr. <HI>Stukely</HI> tells us, in <HI>Derby&s;hire</HI>; and Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> acquaints us, that there are al&s;o &s;uch in <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well as <HI>Wales</HI>; he gives the following Account of this Piece of Antiquity.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"At a Place called <HI>Maen-amber,</HI> &s;ays he, is a Heap of Stones roundi&s;h, and of va&s;t Bulk; but &s;o artificially pitch'd on flat Stones, &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes fewer in Number, that touching the great Stone lightly, it moves, and &s;eems to totter, to the great Amazement of the Ignorant; but &s;tirs not, at lea&s;t not &s;en&s;ibly, when one u&s;es his whole Strength."</Q></P>
<P>Near <HI>Pen&s;ance,</HI> but open to the Sea, is that Gulph they call <HI>Mounts-bay,</HI> named &s;o from a high Hill &s;tanding in the Water, which they call <HI>St. Michael's Mount</HI>; the Seamen call it only <HI>the Corni&s;h Mount.</HI> It has been fortify'd, tho' the Situation of it makes it &s;o difficult of Acce&s;s, that, like the <HI>Ba&s;s</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> there needs no Fortification. Like the <HI>Ba&s;s</HI> too, it was once made a Gaol for Pri&s;oners of State, but now it is wholly neglected. Here is a very good Road for Shipping, which makes the Town of <HI>Pen&s;ance</HI> a Place of good Re&s;ort.</P>
<P>A little up in the Country towards the North-we&s;t is <HI>Godolchan,</HI> which tho' a Hill, rather than a Town, gives Name to the antient and now noble Family of <HI>Godolphin</HI>; and nearer on the Northern Coa&s;t is <HI>Ryalton,</HI> which gives the &s;econd Title to the Earl
<PB N="352" REF="359">
<HI>Godolphin.</HI> This Place al&s;o is infinitely rich in <HI>Tin</HI> Mines.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not end this Account at the utmo&s;t Extent of the I&s;land of <HI>Great Britain</HI> We&s;t, without vi&s;iting tho&s;e kind of <HI>Excre&s;cences</HI> of the I&s;land, the Rocks of <HI>Scilly,</HI> where many good Ships are almo&s;t continually da&s;hed in Pieces, and many brave Lives lo&s;t, in &s;pite of the Mariner's be&s;t Skill, or the Light-hou&s;es and other Sea-marks be&s;t Notice.</P>
<P>The&s;e I&s;les, called in <HI>Latin, Silurum In&s;ulae,</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to be the <HI>Ca&s;&s;iterides</HI> of the An|tients: they lie about 60 Miles from the <HI>Land's-end,</HI> and are a Clu&s;ter of &s;mall I&s;lands, to the Number, as &s;ome reckon, of 145. <HI>Scilly</HI> was once the chief in E&s;timation. But <HI>St. Mary</HI> being the fruitfulle&s;t and large&s;t, tho' but Nine Miles about, has now the Pre-eminence; and it has a very good Harbour, fortify'd with a Ca&s;tle built by Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> The&s;e I&s;les were conquer'd by <HI>Athel&s;tane,</HI> one of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, and from his Time they are deemed a Part of the County of <HI>Cornwall.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e I&s;lands lie &s;o in the Middle between the Two va&s;t Openings of the North and South narrow Seas, or, as the Sailors call them, the <HI>Bri&s;tol Cha|nel,</HI> and <HI>The Chanel,</HI> (&s;o called by way of Eminence) that it cannot, or perhaps never will be avoided, but that &s;everal Ships in the Dark of the Night, and in Stre&s;s of Weather, may by being out in their Reckonings, or other unavoidable Accidents, mi&s;take; and if they do, they are &s;ure, as the Sailors call it, to run <HI>Bump a&s;hore</HI> upon <HI>Scilly,</HI> where they find no Quarter among the Breakers; but are beat to pieces, without any Po&s;&s;ibility of E&s;cape.</P>
<P>One can hardly mention the Rocks of <HI>Scilly,</HI> with|out letting fall a Tear to the Memory of Sir <HI>Cloude&s;ly Shovel,</HI> and all the gallant Spirits with him; who, in the Admiral Ship, with Three Men of War, and all their Men, running upon the&s;e Rocks, right afore
<PB N="353" REF="360">
the Wind, in a dark Night, were lo&s;t, and not a Man &s;aved, in his Return from a fruitle&s;s Expedition again&s;t <HI>Toulon.</HI></P>
<P>They tell us of Eleven Sail of Merchant Ships Homeward-bound, and richly laden from the South-ward, who had the like Fate, in the &s;ame Place, a great many Years ago; and that &s;ome of them com|ing from <HI>Spain,</HI> and having a great Quantity of Bul|lion or Pieces of Eight on board, the Money frequently drives on Shore &s;till, and that in good Quantities, e&s;pecially after &s;tormy Weather.</P>
<P>This may be the Rea&s;on why, as we ob&s;erved during our &s;hort Stay here, &s;everal Mornings after it had blown &s;omething hard in the Night, the Sands were covered with Country People, running to and fro to &s;ee if the Sea had ca&s;t up any thing of value. This the Seamen call <HI>going a &s;horing</HI>; and it &s;eems they often find good Purchace. Sometimes al&s;o dead Bodies are ca&s;t up here, the Con&s;equence of Ship|wrecks among tho&s;e fatal Rocks and I&s;lands; as al&s;o broken Pieces of Ships, Ca&s;ks, Che&s;ts, and almo&s;t every thing that will float, or roll on Shore by the Surges of the Sea.</P>
<P>Nor is it &s;eldom that the &s;avage Country People &s;cuffle and fight about the Right to what they find, and that in a de&s;perate manner; &s;o that this Part of <HI>Cornwall</HI> may truly be &s;aid to be inhabited by a fierce and ravenous People, like tho&s;e on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI>; for they are &s;o greedy and eager for Prey, that they are charged with &s;trange, bloody, and cruel Dealings, even &s;ometimes with one another; but e&s;pecially with poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Seamen, when they are forced on Shore by Tempe&s;ts, and &s;eek Help for their Lives, and where they find the Rocks them|&s;elves not more mercile&s;s, than the People who range about them for their Prey.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o, as a farther Te&s;timony of the immen&s;e Riches which have been lo&s;t at times upon this Coa&s;t,
<PB N="354" REF="361">
we found &s;everal Engineers and Projectors with Diving Engines, attempting to recover what had been lo&s;t, and that not always un&s;ucce&s;sfully.</P>
<P>From the Tops of the Hills, on this Extremity of the Land, you may &s;ee out into what they call the <HI>Chaps of the Chanel</HI>; which, as it is the greate&s;t Inlet of Commerce, and the mo&s;t frequented by Merchant Ships of any Place in the World; &s;o one &s;eldom looks out to Sea-ward, but &s;omething new pre&s;ents of Ships pa&s;&s;ing, or repa&s;&s;ing, either on the great or le&s;&s;er Chanel.</P>
<P>This Point of the <HI>Lizard,</HI> which runs out to the Southward, and the other Promontory mentioned above, make the Two Angles, or Horns, as they are called, from whence 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed this Country re|ceived its fir&s;t Name of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> or, as Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Cornubia</HI> in the <HI>Latin,</HI> and in the <HI>Briti&s;h, Kerneu,</HI> as running out in two va&s;tly extended Horns.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lizard</HI> Point is &s;till more u&s;eful (tho' not &s;o far We&s;t) than the other, which is more properly called the <HI>Land's-end,</HI> being more frequently fir&s;t di&s;covered from the Sea; and is therefore the general Guide, and the Land which the Ships chu&s;e to make fir&s;t; being then &s;ure, that they are pa&s;t <HI>Scilly.</HI></P>
<P>Nature has fortify'd this Part of the I&s;land of <HI>Bri|tain</HI> in a &s;trange manner, and &s;o as is worth a Tra|veller's Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, there are the I&s;lands of <HI>Scilly,</HI> and the Rocks about them; which are placed like Out-works to re&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t A&s;&s;aults of this Enemy the Ocean, and &s;o break the Force of it; as the Piles or Stirlings (as they are called) are placed before the &s;olid Stone-work of <HI>London-bridge,</HI> to fence off the Force, either of the Water, or Ice, or any thing el&s;e that might be dangerous to the Work.</P>
<P>Then there are a va&s;t Number of <HI>&s;unk Rocks,</HI> (&s;o the Seamen call them) be&s;ides &s;uch as are vi&s;ible, and
<PB N="355" REF="362">
above Water; which gradually le&s;&s;en the Quantity of Water, that would otherwi&s;e lie with an infinite Weight and Force upon the Land. 'Tis ob&s;erved, that the&s;e Rocks lie under Water for a great way off into the Sea on every Side the &s;aid Two Horns or Points of Land; &s;o breaking the Force of the Water, and le&s;&s;ening the Weight of it.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, the whole <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> or Body of the Land, which makes this Part of the I&s;le of <HI>Britain,</HI> &s;eems to be one &s;olid Rock, as if it was formed by Nature to re&s;i&s;t the otherwi&s;e irre&s;i&s;tible Power of the Ocean. And indeed, if one was to ob&s;erve with what Fury the Sea comes on &s;ometimes again&s;t the Shore here, e&s;pecially at the <HI>Lizard Point,</HI> where there are but few, if any Out-works, (as I call them) to re&s;i&s;t it; how high the Waves come rolling forward, &s;torming on the Back of one an|other, particularly when the Wind blows <HI>off Sea,</HI> one would wonder, that even the &s;tronge&s;t Rocks them&s;elves &s;hould be able to re&s;i&s;t and repel them. But, as I &s;aid, the Country &s;eems to be one great Body of Stone, and prepar'd &s;o on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And yet, as if all this was not enough, Nature has provided another &s;trong Fence, and that is, that the&s;e va&s;t Rocks are, in a manner, cemented toge|ther by the &s;olid and weighty Ore of TIN and COP|PER, e&s;pecially the latter, which is plentifully found upon the very outmo&s;t Edge of the Land, and with which the Stones may be &s;aid to be &s;older'd together, le&s;t the Force of the Sea &s;hould &s;eparate and disjoint them, and, breaking in upon the&s;e Fortifications of the I&s;land, de&s;troy its chief Security.</P>
<P>This is certain, that there is a more than ordinary Quantity of Tin, Copper, and Lead al&s;o, fixed by the Great Author of Nature in the&s;e very remote Angles; &s;o that the Ore is found upon the very Surface of the Rocks a good way into the Sea, and does not only lie, as it were, upon or between the Stones among the
<PB N="356" REF="363">
Earth, which in that Ca&s;e might be wa&s;h'd from it by the Sea; but is even blended or mix'd in with the Stones them&s;elves, &s;o that the Stones mu&s;t be &s;plit into Pieces to come at it. By this Mixture the Rocks are made exceedingly weighty and &s;olid, and thereby &s;till the more qualified to repel the Force of the Sea.</P>
<P>Upon this remote Part of the I&s;land we &s;aw great Numbers of that famous kind of <HI>Crows,</HI> which is known by the Name of the <HI>Corni&s;h Chough:</HI> they are the &s;ame kind which are found in <HI>Switzerland</HI> among the <HI>Alps,</HI> and which, <HI>Pliny</HI> pretended, were peculiar to tho&s;e Mountains, and calls the <HI>Pyrrhocorax.</HI> The Body is <HI>Black,</HI> the Legs, Feet, and Bill, of a <HI>Yellow,</HI> almo&s;t to a <HI>Red.</HI> I could not find, that it was affected for any good Quality it had, nor is the Fle&s;h good to eat, for it feeds much on Fi&s;h and Carrion; it is counted little better than a Kite, for it is of a ravenous Quality, and is very mi&s;chievous; it will &s;teal and carry away any think it finds about the Hou&s;e, that is not too heavy, tho' not fit for its Food; as Knives, Forks, Spoons and Linen Cloths, or whatever it can fly away with; &s;ometimes, they &s;ay, it has &s;tolen Bits of Firebrands, or lighted Candles, and lodged them in the Stacks of Corn, and the Thatch of Barns and Hou&s;es, and &s;et them on Fire.</P>
<P>I might take up many Sheets in de&s;cribing the va|luable Curio&s;ities of this little <HI>Cher&s;one&s;e,</HI> called the <HI>Land's-end,</HI> in which lies an immen&s;e Trea&s;ure, and many Things worth Notice, be&s;ides tho&s;e to be found upon the Surface: but I am too near the End of this Letter. If I have Opportunity, I &s;hall take Notice of &s;ome Part of what I omit here, in my Return by the Northern Shore of the County. In the mean time,</P>
