<P>FAR be from the author the pre&s;umption of affixing to this trifle any thing &s;o re|&s;pectable as YOUR Name. What impudence to have ventured to place it, where he has a &s;cruple to &s;uffer one of &s;o little importance
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
as his own to make its appearance! But the character of Writer, which the late ex|treme abu&s;e of that talent has not at all con|tributed to illu&s;trate, does not invite power|fully enough to the producing one's &s;elf pro|fe&s;&s;edly in that light to the Public.</P>
<P>The &s;ole view of the author in the liberty he is now ri&s;king, is only by way of appeal to YOU, MADAM, whether the character of complete dome&s;tic virtue, attempted in that of <HI>Philodamus,</HI> has been faithfully copied from nature. Of this, MADAM, it is impo&s;|&s;ible, any one can be &s;o good a judge as YOURSELF, who have con&s;tantly before YOUR eyes the mo&s;t perfect example of it, that, perhaps, ever actually exi&s;ted: an example,
<PB N="v" REF="4">
who&s;e lu&s;tre &s;till to increa&s;e, YOU are con|tented, MADAM, to &s;uffer YOUR own great and amiable qualities, which in any other part of the world would have bur&s;t out un|rivalled, to rank, in this, but in the &s;econd place. The lo&s;s is compen&s;ated in the great &s;hare it is allowed, MADAM, YOU have in the very virtues to which YOU yield the pre|eminence. They are &s;uch, that had they been exerci&s;ed only within the walls of a pri|vate family, they could not have failed of winning their way abroad into the general e&s;teem of mankind. What univer&s;al adora|tion mu&s;t they then command, when it is no|thing le&s;s than the mo&s;t extended dominion upon the globe, which, in reality, proves to be this va&s;t family, under the mo&s;t vigilant
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
and indulgent of parents; and receives to its utmo&s;t boundary the effects of that fa|therly tenderne&s;s and benevolence, which &s;eem to have been fir&s;t put in practice in their more immediate connections, in order to learn from experience how they might afterwards be be&s;t applied, and diffu&s;ed, to the mo&s;t di|&s;tant!</P>
<P>If, in return, MADAM, our prayers to Heaven are but &s;hort, it proceeds from no deficiency in our gratitude; we think we have fulfilled every dictate of duty and love, when we have ardently petitioned, that YOU, MADAM, may long continue to &s;hare, adorn, and reward, all the virtues that can render human nature amiable and re&s;pectable.</P>

<L>Why art thou here, Euphemia? to unman me?</L>
<L>Now, that I've born the parting of a father,</L>
<L>With all I have of &s;teadine&s;s, art thou come</L>
<L>To rob me of that la&s;t of vanities,</L>
<L>Which cowards &s;ometimes reach, the dying re&s;olute?</L>
<L>I'm young, am born to dignity, and affluence;</L>
<L>Have health untainted, and th' e&s;teem of friends.</L>
<L>The&s;e I could have re&s;ign'd, yet be my&s;elf,</L>

<L>But when I view thy beauties, which I quit</L>
<L>Purchas'd, but unpo&s;&s;e&s;s'd; there lies the agony,</L>
<L>And it grows terrible indeed to die.</L>

<L>I came to &s;teel thy brea&s;t, and not to melt it</L>
