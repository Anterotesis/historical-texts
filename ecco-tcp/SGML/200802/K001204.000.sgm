<P>Before I offer any thing to the con&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, I beg leave to return my very &s;incere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">nks,&mdash;not to my honourable friends near me, for that I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">rly unequal to, but to the two honourable gentlemen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">o &s;poke fir&s;t on the other &s;ide of the Hou&s;e, for the candid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">en, and liberal manner, in which they have explained the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">und of their oppo&s;ition to the motion. They think, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ey declare, that having had a duel with Mr. Ha&s;tings, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ght not to be employed in impeaching him. This is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;t time I ever heard the objection &s;tated in a regular par|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">mentary way.

It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> not an ea&s;y &s;ituation; but I could not avoid it with pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ety.

was not very full that day; many gentlemen, who now hear me, mu&s;t have been ab&s;ent. I &s;hall, therefore, reque&s;t your per|mi&s;&s;ion to repeat the &s;ub&s;tance of what I &s;ubmitted to you on that occa&s;ion, without argument or detail. All I mean is to &s;tate the facts briefly, and to leave the re&s;ults from them to be determined by their impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of every man of honour who hears me. I was appointed by Parlia|ment with Sir John Clavering and Colonel Mon&s;on to a place in the government of Bengal in conjunction with Mr. Ha&s;tings, whom we had never &s;een. We went to India prejudiced,&mdash;pa&s;&s;ionately prejudiced in his favour. Almo&s;t in&s;tantly after our arrival there we found rea&s;ons to abandon the opinion we had formed of him, and in&s;tead of &s;upporting we attacked him. At that moment at lea&s;t there could be no per&s;onal animo&s;ity in us towards a man, who had never per&s;onally offended us. From the moment we knew him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> our oppo&s;ition to him began, and was continued by each o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> us, without intermi&s;&s;ion, as long as we had the power of op|po&s;ing him. Whatever may be thought of <HI>my</HI> character<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> no man, I believe, will attribute the conduct of my honor+able colleagues to ba&s;e, vindictive motives. This honorabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hou&s;e, I am &s;ure, will never concur in any thing that offer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> an indignity to the venerable names of Clavering and Mon+&s;on. In the year 1780, a pacification took place between Mr Ha&s;tings and me; the rea&s;ons and purpo&s;es of which it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> unnece&s;&s;ary to mention, as they are fully &s;tated in the Reports of the Select Committee. Out of this pacification a differenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> between us unfortunately aro&s;e, which ended in a duel. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the merits of the que&s;tion I &s;ay nothing. The language h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> made u&s;e of, on the records of the council, obliged me to &s;eek for reparation in point of honour, at the hazard of my life. It would be ab&s;urd to call it revenge. The aggre&s;&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> in effect is the challenger, and meets his opponent on equa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> terms.

A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the approach of death, which I thought inevitable, the af+fairs of this world in a moment lo&s;t all their importance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the veil was removed; I thought of nothing then, but to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> in peace with all men, particularly with Mr. Ha&s;tings. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> called him to me, gave him my hand, and de&s;ired him to con+&s;ider in what &s;ituation my death would leave him.

<PB N="5" REF="5" MS="y">
the fatal con&s;equence which had attended it. I meant that we &s;hould &s;tand in the &s;ame relation to each other, as if the duel and the cau&s;e of it had never happened. But did I tell him, that if I &s;urvived, I would renounce the whole plan and principle of my public life; that I would cea&s;e to oppo&s;e his mea&s;ures; that I would de&s;ert the charges, which I had al|ready brought again&s;t him, or not pro&s;ecute him by public impeachment if I could? No, Sir, never; nor am I charged with it. If I had done &s;o, I mu&s;t have di&s;honoured my&s;elf for ever, without a motive and without a compen&s;ation. On my return to England, I found that a parliamentary inquiry into the late tran&s;actions in India was already begun, and I was almo&s;t immediately ordered to attend one of the Com|mittees employed upon that inquiry. Of tho&s;e gentlemen who think that I ought not to appear again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings, I beg leave to a&s;k, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n what manner I ought to have acted? Could I, without treachery to the public, refu&s;e to give evi|dence or information nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;ervice, when it was demanded of me by the authority of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons? or, in fact, was it in my power? Will any man affirm that I had an option? If not, the &s;ingle que&s;tion is, in what form and manner did it become me to appear and act as the accu&s;er of Mr. Ha&s;tings? What, in the character of evidence only? Would that have been a part to which no enmity, no malice could have been imputed. Would it have been honorable in me to &s;tand aloof or hide my&s;elf, while in fact I &s;upplied the information, while I furni&s;hed the materials, and prompted the pro&s;ecution? or, am I thought to have acted di&s;honora|bly, becau&s;e I declared my&s;elf the public re&s;pon&s;ible accu&s;er of Mr. Ha&s;tings? becau&s;e I avowed my principles, becau&s;e I &s;tood forward in the charge, and hazarded all tho&s;e con&s;e|quences of obloquy, retaliation, and revenge, which a public pro&s;ecutor mu&s;t encounter, but, which a &s;ecret &s;kulking ac|cu&s;er may very ea&s;ily avoid? The&s;e are que&s;tions, I tru&s;t, which an&s;wer them&s;elves in the mind of every man of honor. Sir, I do not mean to &s;ay, that the circum&s;tance of my hav|ing had a duel with Mr. Ha&s;tings never occurred to me as an objection, which po&s;&s;ibly might have weight with others, though it appeared to me of no con&s;equence. It did cer|tainly occur to me as a doubt, on which I ought not to tru&s;t entirely to my own judgement. But, the honourable per|&s;on whom I con&s;ulted, is no more, and for that rea&s;on I have hitherto been tender of mentioning his name. They, who
<PB N="6" REF="6" MS="y">
knew Sir William Draper, I am &s;ure will acknowledge that there could not be a &s;tricter and more &s;crupulous judge of points of honor than he was. If it were po&s;&s;ible to produce the opinion he gave me, in approbation of the conduct I have pur&s;ued, I &s;hould look no farther. But there is an au|thority to the &s;ame effect, which I am able to produce, and which, though negative in its form, I doubt not will be deemed equivalent to any po&s;itive opinion whatever. I have now been engaged above two years in con&s;tant intercour&s;e and connection with twenty gentlemen of the fir&s;t character in this kingdom, and in con&s;tant conver&s;ation with them on the &s;ubject of this impeachment; I mean particularly the gentlemen who compo&s;e the pre&s;ent Committee, as well as many others. I appeal to their te&s;timony, I appeal &s;pecially to the honourable General Officer <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">General Burgoyne.</NOTE> near me, who&s;e opinion, I believe, will be allowed to be authority, not only to me, but to the world. Did any of the&s;e gentlemen ever, directly or indirectly, &s;ignify to me a doubt about the propriety of my conduct? If they did, I call upon them now to declare it. Is it a thing to be believed, that if they had felt a &s;cru|ple, in point of honor, on this &s;ubject, they would never have expre&s;&s;ed it to me, or that they would have acted with me, if I had known and di&s;regarded their opinion?</P>
<P>Thirteen years are now elap&s;ed, &s;ince I fir&s;t was connected in office with Mr. Ha&s;tings. Six of them were wa&s;ted in India in perpetual conte&s;t with him. Seven years ago, I left him there in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ab&s;olute power. In all that time no charges have been produced again&s;t me. Yet, I think it cannot be &s;aid that I have been particularly cautious not to provoke ho&s;tility, or that there is no di&s;po&s;ition any where to accu&s;e me. Surely, Sir, if accu&s;ation is ever to come, it is high time it &s;hould appear. If now, or at any other period, I &s;hould be obliged to change place with Mr. Ha&s;tings; if hereafter it &s;hould be my lot to be accu&s;ed, I &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly never ob|ject to his being my pro&s;ecutor; for, though by removing a powerful, a well-informed, and, in the &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ent argument, an inveterate accu&s;er, I might provide for my &s;afety, my honor would be lo&s;t. Let tho&s;e gentlemen, who are tru&s;ted with the care of Mr. Ha&s;tings's honor con&s;ider what they are doing.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7" MS="y">I beg of gentlemen to ob&s;erve, that in the pre&s;ent que&s;tion I am nothing but a pa&s;&s;ive in&s;trument at the di&s;po&s;al of the Hou&s;e. If they think fit to employ me, I &s;hall endeavour to execute their commands with indu&s;try and vigour; if not, I &s;hall con&s;ider it as the happie&s;t period at which I could re|ceive my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and rejoice in the liberty, to which it will re&s;tore me, of turning my thoughts to &s;ome other object, of applying my faculties to &s;ome other occupation. That I &s;hould ever be engaged in another &s;ervice, &s;o vexatious, &s;o laborious, &s;o invidious, and &s;o unprofitable, as this has been, I am &s;ure is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Mr. Francis left the Hou&s;e as &s;oon as he fini&s;hed his &s;peech.</P>
