<P>My dear, I embrace you!&mdash;Not &s;eeing you among the beau-monde, I was afraid there had been &s;ome fre&s;h mi&s;under&s;tanding between you and the law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, my dear, I have had a narrow e&s;cape &s;ince I &s;aw you. I had like to have been preferr'd in &s;ome of our &s;ettlements abroad&mdash;but I found there was no doing the bu&s;ine&s;s by deputy&mdash;&s;o&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I don't know&mdash;meeting one night with a certain Portugue&s;e Jew-merchant, in one of the back &s;treets here by the Exchange&mdash;(I was a little in liquor I believe&mdash;piping hot from a turtle-fea&s;t) it came into my giddy head to &s;top him, out of mere curio&s;ity to a&s;k what news from Germany&mdash;nothing more&mdash;and the fellow, not under&s;tanding good Eng|li&s;h, wou'd needs have it that I a&s;k'd him for &s;ome|thing el&s;e.&mdash;He bawl'd out, up came the watch, down was I laid in the kennel, and then carried be|fore a magi&s;trate.&mdash;He clapp'd me on a &s;tone doublet, that I cou'd not get off my back for two months.</P>

<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>And there I might have rotted, if I had not had great friends; a certain lady of quality's woman's cou&s;in that was kept by Mr. Quirk, of Thavies-Inn, you mu&s;t know, was in love with me, and &s;he&mdash;</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am with mine, I a&s;&s;ure you: I am retir'd from the great world,&mdash;that's my ta&s;te now&mdash;and live in the country, with one Mr Harlowe&mdash;piping hot from his travels&mdash;'Tis a charming young fellow! Drinking, hunting, and wenching, my boy!&mdash;a man of univer&s;al knowledge.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, his father wou'd marry him here in town, it &s;eems, and he&mdash;cho&s;e to be married in the country&mdash;that's all. The truth is, our young gentleman manag'd matters with the young lady &s;o ill&mdash;or &s;o well&mdash;that upon his father's return there was hot con&s;ulting among the relations; and the lady being of a good family, and having a &s;mart, fighting fellow of a brother in the army&mdash;why, my matter, who hates quarrelling, &s;poke to the old gentleman, and the affair's hu&s;h'd up by a mar|riage, that's all.</P>
