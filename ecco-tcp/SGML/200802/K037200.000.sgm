<HEAD><HI>PROLOGUE.</HI> Spoken by Mr. MURRAY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE time hath been, but in a barbarous age,</L>
<L>When poets brav'd their audience from the &s;tage,</L>
<L>Poets pontifical, who&s;e lofty tone</L>
<L>Acknowledg'd no tribunal but their own,</L>
<L>And &s;ent their Prologue-purveyor to rai&s;e</L>
<L>Fir&s;t fruits and fines of tributary prai&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our modern bards are taught an humbler &s;train,</L>
<L>And, if le&s;s valiant, are not half &s;o vain;</L>
<L>No longer aim the nation's ta&s;te to lead,</L>
<L>Content if they can follow and &s;ucceed.</L>
<L>Thus if the time &s;hould come, when in the place</L>
<L>Of Nature you &s;hou'd &s;ub&s;titute grimace,</L>
<L>(Fatal rever&s;e!) What cou'd the Poet do?</L>
<L>Offend the many to appea&s;e the few?</L>
<L>No, if in Greece true ta&s;te had been as &s;carce,</L>
<L>The Stagyrite him&s;elf had &s;tood for farce.</L>
<L>If wit thro' five long acts will not hold out,</L>
<L>Momus mu&s;t help to &s;tir the laugh about,</L>
<L>And when you crown his mummery with applau&s;e,</L>
<L>You bribe him to tran&s;gre&s;s the drama's laws.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He were a very wild romantic elf,</L>
<L>Who only wrote to figure on the &s;helf;</L>
<L>To hear his own &s;ad &s;entiments rebound</L>
<L>Thro' empty galleries with a dying &s;ound,</L>
<L>And &s;it like Seneca in calm decay,</L>
<L>Watching how life &s;teals drop by drop away:</L>
<L>No, let him take his profit and his ea&s;e,</L>
<L>And trifle on &s;o long as trifles plea&s;e:</L>
<L>Too weak to &s;truggle again&s;t fa&s;hion's tide,</L>
<L>If with the current he's content to glide,</L>
<L>He only yields as Cae&s;ar did before,</L>
<L>When Tiber's torrent drove him from the &s;hore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The &s;imple tale we have to tell this night,</L>
<L>Shews truth triumphant over ranc'rous &s;pite,</L>
<L>Ca&s;ts in dark &s;hades the ba&s;e defamer's part,</L>
<L>And crowns with ju&s;t reward the liberal heart.</L>
<L>Oh might our efforts gain their wi&s;ht for end,</L>
<L>The gay to' amu&s;e, the faulty to amend,</L>
<L>Make fiction rule her thoughts by nature's laws,</L>
<L>And wit exert her powers in virtue's cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Then and then only might we claim applau&s;e.</L>

<P>There's one a-coming will do that. Fair Emily will be a wife before you'll be a widow. Young Montrath is the man for her; he's expected every day with his uncle Sir Oliver. It is all agreed upon, and my lady's whole fortune will be &s;ettled on Mi&s;s Emily. There's a &s;tart for you&mdash;there's a &s;ally from dependance to pro&s;perity; from wanting every thing to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all.</P>
</SP>

<P>I can't do it; I am not equal to the ta&s;k; I can't approach &s;o near, and yet refrain. When &s;he &s;poke to me, I &s;hou'd be lo&s;t; when &s;he look'd on me, I &s;hou'd betray my&s;elf; and when I hand|ed her the plate, I &s;hould pre&s;ent it on my knee.</P>

<P>Hold there! tho' dangerous in the extreme it is not altogether de&s;perate. If I cannot under|take the offices you de&s;cribe, I may yet pre&s;ent my&s;elf as a candidate for her &s;ervice; and in that character perhaps obtain an interview with my charmer. That hope is worth an effort.</P>

<P>I hope &s;o too. You and your fair wife are welcome. She is a child of the ca&s;tle, and will grace our dance.</P>

<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, under favour, Jenny, tho' I &s;ay it, has all the &s;teps that now are thought &s;o graceful: &s;he'll balance on one leg and &s;end the other upon a cruize into her neighbour's pocket; no magnetiz|ing doctor or dotterell-monger can &s;urpa&s;s my Jenny for the fine attitudes.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're a &s;trange mortal; but let mirth go round, and if the humble annals of our ca&s;tle can cheer one hone&s;t, ea&s;e one heavy heart, our harmle&s;s efforts have not been in vain.</P>

<HEAD><HI>EPILOGUE.</HI> Spoken by Mi&s;s BETTERTON.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>NOW <HI>Fal&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions</HI> are no more in view,</L>
<L>Allow me to pre&s;ent you with the true&mdash;</L>
<L>A bond it is, impre&s;s'd by honor's &s;eal,</L>
<L>With Truth's fair form, grav'd in perennial &s;teel;</L>
<L>A bond of gratitude, to which I &s;et</L>
<L>Both hand and heart to verify my debt;</L>
<L>And tho' in law an infant, and in merit</L>
<L>Poor, as heav'n knows, I am not poor in &s;pirit;</L>
<L>I'll pay you when I'm able from my gains;</L>
<L>If you'll have patience, I'll not &s;pare for pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In truth I did not &s;eek this awful po&s;t;</L>
<L>No champion I to face &s;o brave a ho&s;t.</L>
<L>There are, who when five yawning acts are o'er,</L>
<L>Can tickle tho&s;e &s;ame yawners till they roar;</L>
<L>The&s;e are the friends our pro&s;ing bard &s;hould court;</L>
<L>He gives &s;oft &s;lumbers, but they make the &s;port;</L>
<L>They have the &s;pell to puff the &s;tage balloon</L>
<L>Brim full of gas, and blow it to the moon:</L>
<L>Not &s;o our poet&mdash;He accounts it right</L>
<L>To keep his critics ever in his &s;ight;</L>
<L>Such jaunts might turn their brains, di&s;turb their thinking,</L>
<L>And &s;end them where they'd lo&s;e the art of &s;inking.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rigour, when ju&s;t, he can, he will endure,</L>
<L>The &s;tream is bitter, but the &s;pring is pure;</L>
<L>Candor, when candor haply he can meet,</L>
<L>Like Mo&s;es' rod, can turn the bitter &s;weet;</L>
<L>But the foul puddle, in which malice dips,</L>
<L>Is a dire do&s;e&mdash;He &s;purns it from his lips.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He writes, becau&s;e, tho' writing is abus'd,</L>
<L>The world is not too grave to be amus'd;</L>
<L>He writes, and ever to &s;ome moral end,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e the world is not too good to mend.</L>
<L>Soft female hearts are prone as wax to melt,</L>
<L>And, true or fal&s;e, impre&s;&s;ions will be felt;</L>
<L>Youth's yielding clay too ea&s;ily receives</L>
<L>The featur'd &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">mp that cro&s;s-ey'd cunning gives:</L>
<L>Therefore let her, who&s;e dang'rous lot in life</L>
<L>Hangs on the balance betwixt maid and wife,</L>
<L>Lay tho&s;e few &s;hort pre&s;criptions to her heart,</L>
<L>With which the Lady Cypre&s;s clos'd her part;</L>
<L>For ba&s;e &s;eduction &s;preads on every &s;ide</L>
<L>His treach'rous &s;nares to me&s;h th' unwary bride.</L>
<L>She, in who&s;e eyes enticing Cupids play,</L>
<L>Gives impudence the clue, and leads the way.</L>
<L>What tho' the faithle&s;s hu&s;band quits her hand,</L>
<L>Truth, like a column, of it&s;elf can &s;tand:</L>
<L>To reas'ning minds &s;ufficient &s;trength is giv'n,</L>
<L>And none but fools can charge their faults on heav'n.</L>
