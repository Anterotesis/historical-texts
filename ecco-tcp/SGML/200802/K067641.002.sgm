<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>ANTHONY BREWER,</HEAD>
<P>_A POET who flouri&s;hed in the reign of Charles I. but of who&s;e birth and life we can recover no particu|lars. He was highly e&s;teemed by &s;ome wits in that reign, as appears from a Poem called Steps to Par|na&s;&s;us, which pays him the following well turned compliment.<Q><PB N="2" REF="5"><L>Let Brewer take his artful pen in hand,</L>
<L>Attending mu&s;es will obey command,</L>
<L>Invoke the aid of Shake&s;pear's &s;leeping clay,</L>
<L>And &s;trike from utter darkne&s;s new born day.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Win&s;tanley, and after him Chetwood, has attributed a play to our author called Lingua, or the Contention of the Tongue and the Five Sen&s;es for Superiority, a Comedy, acted at Cambridge, 1606; but Mr. Langbaine is of opinion, that nei|ther that, Love's Load&s;tone, Landagartha, or Love's Dominion, as Win&s;tanley and Philips affirm, are his; Landagartha being written by Henry Burnel, e&s;quire, and Love's Dominion by Flecknoe. In the Comedy called Lingua, there is a circum|&s;tance which Chetwood mentions, too curious to be omitted here. When this play was acted at Cambridge, Oliver Cromwel performed the part of Tactus, which he felt &s;o warmly, that it fir&s;t fired his ambition, and, from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an imaginary crown, he &s;tretched his views to a real one; to accompli&s;h which, he was content to wade through a &s;ea of blood, and, as Mr. Gray beauti|fully expre&s;&s;es it, &s;hut the Gates of Mercy on Man|kind; the &s;peech with which he is &s;aid to have been &s;o affected, is the following,<Q><L>Ro&s;es, and bays, pack hence! this crown and robe,</L>
<L>My brows, and body, circles and inve&s;ts;</L>
<L>How gallantly it fits me! &s;ure the &s;lave</L>
<L>Mea&s;ured my head, that wrought this coronet;</L>
<L>They lie that &s;ay, complexions cannot change!</L>
<L>My blood's enobled, and I am transform'd</L>
<L>Unto the &s;acred temper of a king;</L>
<L>Methinks I hear my noble Para&s;ites</L>
<L>Stiling me Cae&s;ar, or great Alexander,</L>
<L>Licking my feet,&mdash;&amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">
Mr. Langbaine a&s;cribes to Brewer the two fol|lowing plays,<LIST>
<ITEM>Country Girl, a Comedy, often acted with ap|plau&s;e, printed in 4to. 1647. This play has been revived &s;ince the Re&s;toration, under the title of Coun|try Innocence, or the Chamber-maid turned Quaker.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Love-&s;ick King, an Engli&s;h Tragical Hi&s;tory, with the Life and Death of Carte&s;munda, the Fair Nun of Winche&s;ter; printed in 4to. London, 1655; this play was likewi&s;e revived 1680, and acted by the name of the Perjured Nun. The hi&s;torical part of the plot is founded upon the In|va&s;ion of the Danes, in the reign of King Ethelred and Alfred.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This la&s;t play of Anthony Brewer's, is one of the be&s;t irregular plays, next to tho&s;e of Shake|&s;pear, which are in our language. The &s;tory, which is extremely intere&s;ting, is conducted, not &s;o much with art, as &s;pirit; the characters are ani|mated, and the &s;cene bu&s;y. Canutus King of Denmark, after having gained the city of Win|che&s;ter, by the villainy of a native, orders all to be put to the &s;word, and at la&s;t enters the Cloi&s;ter, raging with the thir&s;t of blood, and panting for de&s;truction; he meets Carte&s;munda, who&s;e beauty &s;tops his ruffian violence, and melts him, as it were, into a human creature. The language of this play is as modern, and the ver&s;es as mu&s;ical as tho&s;e of Rowe; fire and elevation run through it, and there are many &s;trokes of the mo&s;t melting ten|derne&s;s. Carte&s;munda, the Fair Nun of Win|che&s;ter, in&s;pires the King with a pa&s;&s;ion for her, and after a long &s;truggle between honour and love, &s;he at la&s;t yields to the tyrant, and for the &s;ake of Canutus breaks her ve&s;tal vows. Upon hearing that the enemy was about to enter the
<PB N="4" REF="7">
Cloi&s;ter, Carte&s;munda breaks out into the following beautiful exclamation:<Q><L>The raging foe pur&s;ues, defend us Heaven!</L>
<L>Take virgin tears, the balm of martyr'd &s;aints</L>
<L>As tribute due, to thy tribunal throne;</L>
<L>With thy right hand keep us from rage and mur|der;</L>
<L>Let not our danger fright us, but our &s;ins;</L>
<L>Misfortunes touch our bodies, not our &s;ouls.</L></Q></P>
<P>When Canutus advances, and fir&s;t &s;ees Carte&s;|munda, his &s;peech is poetical, and conceived in the true &s;pirit of Tragedy.<Q><L>Ha! who holds my conquering hand? what power unknown,</L>
<L>By magic thus transforms me to a &s;tatue,</L>
<L>Sen&s;ele&s;s of all the faculties of life?</L>
<L>My blood runs back, I have no power to &s;trike;</L>
<L>Call in our guards and bid 'em all give o'er.</L>
<L>Sheath up your &s;words with me, and cea&s;e to kill:</L>
<L>Her angel beauty cries, &s;he mu&s;t not die,</L>
<L>Nor live but mine: O I am &s;trangely touch'd!</L>
<L>Methinks I lift my &s;word, again&s;t my&s;elf,</L>
<L>When I oppo&s;e her&mdash;all perfection!</L>
<L>O &s;ee! the pearled dew drops from her eyes;</L>
<L>Ari&s;e in peace, &s;weet &s;oul.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the &s;ame &s;cene the following is extremely beautiful.<Q><L>I'm &s;truck with light'ning from the torrid zone;</L>
<L>Stand all between me, and that flaming &s;un!</L>
<L>Go Erkinwald, convey her to my tent.</L>
<L>Let her be guarded with more watchful eyes</L>
<L>Than heaven has &s;tars:</L>
<L>If here &s;he &s;tay I &s;hall con&s;ume to death,</L>
<L>'Tis time can give my pa&s;&s;ions remedy,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="8">
Art thou not gone! kill him that gazeth on her;</L>
<L>For all that &s;ee her &s;ure mu&s;t doat like me,</L>
<L>And trea&s;on for her, will be wrought again&s;t us.</L>
<L>Be &s;udden&mdash;to our tents&mdash;pray thee away,</L>
<L>The hell on earth is love that brings delay.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>THOMAS MAY,</HEAD>
<P>A POET and hi&s;torian of the 17th century, was de&s;cended of an ancient, but decayed family in the county of Su&s;&s;ex, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Langbaine's Lives of the Poets.</NOTE>, and was educated a fellow commoner in Sidney Su&s;&s;ex College in Cambridge. He afterwards removed to London, and lived about the court, where he contracted friend&s;hips with &s;everal gentlemen of fa&s;hion and di&s;tinction, e&s;pe|cially with Endymion Port&eacute;r e&s;quire, one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber to King Charles I. while he re&s;ided at court he wrote five plays, which are extant under his name. In 1622, he pub|li&s;hed at London, in 8vo. a tran&s;lation of Virgil's Georgics with annotations; and in 1635, a Poem on King Edward III. It was printed under the title of the Victorious Reign of Edward III. written in &s;even books, by his Maje&s;ty's command. In the dedication to Charles I. our author writes thus; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;hould humbly have craved your Maje&s;ty's pardon for my omi&s;&s;ion of the latter part of King Edward's reign, but that the &s;en&s;e of mine own defects hath put me in mind of a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;uit, &s;o beg forgivene&s;s for that part which is here written. Tho&s;e great actions of Edward III. are the arguments of this poem, which is here
<PB N="6" REF="9">
ended, where his fortune began to decline, where the French by revolts, and private prac|tices regained that which had been won from them by eminent and famous victories; which times may afford fitter ob&s;ervations for an acute hi&s;torian in pro&s;e, than &s;trains of heighth for an heroic poem."</Q> The poem thus begins,<Q><L>The third, and greate&s;t Edward's reign we &s;ing,</L>
<L>The high atchievements of that martial King,</L>
<L>Where long &s;ucce&s;sful prowe&s;&s;e did advance,</L>
<L>So many trophies in triumphed France,</L>
<L>And fir&s;t her golden lillies bare; who o're</L>
<L>Pyrennes mountains to that we&s;tern &s;hore,</L>
<L>Where Tagus tumbles through his yellow &s;and</L>
<L>Into the ocean; &s;tretch'd his conquering hand.</L></Q></P>
<P>From the lines quoted, the reader will be able to judge what &s;ort of ver&s;i&s;ier our author was, and from this beginning he has no great rea&s;on to expect an entertaining poem, e&s;pecially as it is of the hi&s;torical kind; and he who begins a poem thus in&s;ipidly, can never expect his readers to ac|company him to the third page. May likewi&s;e tran&s;lated Lucan's Phar&s;alia, which poem he conti|nued down to the death of Julius Cae&s;ar, both in Latin and Engli&s;h ver&s;e.</P>
<P>Dr. Fuller &s;ays, that &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t was given to him at court, which alienated his affections from it, and determined him, in the civil wars to adhere to the Parliament.</P>
<P>Mr. Philips in his Theatrum Poetarum, ob&s;erves, that he &s;tood candidate with Sir William Davenant for the Laurel, and his ambition being fru&s;trated, he conceived the mo&s;t violent aver&s;ion to the King and Queen. Sir William Davenant, be&s;ides the acknowledged &s;uperiority of his abilities, had ever di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for loyalty, and was patro|nized and favoured by men of power, e&s;pecially the Marquis of Newca&s;tle: a circum&s;tance which
<PB N="7" REF="10">
we find not to have happened to May: it is true, they were both the friends of the amiable Endy|mion Porter, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> but we are not informed whe|ther that gentleman intere&s;ted him&s;elf on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>In the year 1647, was publi&s;hed in London in folio, The Hi&s;tory of the Parliament of Eng|land, which began November 3, 1640, with a Short and Nece&s;&s;ary View of &s;ome precedent Years, written by Thomas May, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Secretary to the Parliament, and publi&s;hed by their authority. In 1650 he publi&s;hed in 8vo. A Breviary of the Hi&s;tory of the Parliament of England. Be&s;ides the&s;e works, Mr. Philips tells us, he wrote a Hi&s;|tory of Henry IV. in Engli&s;h ver&s;e, the Comedy of the Old Wives Tale, and the Hi&s;tory of Orlando Furio&s;o; but the latter, Mr. Langbaine, who is a higher authority than Philips, a&s;&s;ures us was written before May was able to hold a pen, much le&s;s to write a play, being printed in 410. London, 1594. Mr. Win&s;tanley &s;ays, that in his hi&s;tory, he &s;hews all the &s;pleen of a mal-content, and had he been preferred to the Bays, as he happened to be di&s;|appointed, he would have embraced the Royal in|tere&s;t with as much zeal, as he did the republi|can: for a man who e&s;pou&s;es a cau&s;e from &s;pite only, can be depended upon by no party, becau&s;e he acts n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t upon any principles of honour or conviction.</P>
<P>Our author died &s;uddenly in the year 1652, and was interred near the tomb of Camden, on the We&s;t &s;ide of the North i&s;le of We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, but his body, with &s;everal others, was dug up after the re&s;toration, and buried in a pit in St. Margaret's church yard<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Wood's Fa&s;ti Oxon. vol. i. p. 205.</NOTE>. Mr. May's plays are,<LIST>

<HEAD>JOHN TAYLOUR, Water-Poet,</HEAD>
<P>WAS born in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, where he went to &s;chool with one Green, and hav|ing got into his accidence, was bound apprentice to a Waterman in London, which, though a labo|rious employment, did not &s;o much depre&s;s his mind, but that he &s;ometimes indulged him&s;elf in poetry. Taylour retates a whim&s;ical &s;tory of his &s;choolma&s;ter Mr. Green, which we &s;hall here in&s;ert upon the authority of Win&s;tanley. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Green loved new milk &s;o well, that in order to have it new, he went to the market to buy a cow, but his eyes being dim, he cheapened a bull, and ask|ing the price of the bea&s;t, the owner and he a|greed, and driving it home, would have his maid to milk it, which &s;he attempting to do, could find no teats; and whil&s;t the maid and her ma&s;ter were arguing the matter, the bull very fairly pi&s;&s;ed into the pail;"</Q> whereupon his &s;cho|lar John Taylour wrote the&s;e ver&s;es.<Q><L>Our ma&s;ter Green was over&s;een</L>
<L>In buying of a bull,</L>
<L>For when the maid did mean to milk,</L>
<L>He pi&s;s'd the pail half full.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">
Our Water-poet found lei&s;ure to write four&s;core books, &s;ome of which occa&s;ioned diver&s;ion enough in their time, and were thought worthy to be collec|ted in a folio volume. Mr. Wood ob&s;erves, that had he had learning equal to his natural genius, which was excellent, he might have equalled, if not ex|celled, many who claim a great &s;hare in the temple of the mu&s;es. Upon breaking out of the rebellion, 1642, he left London, and retired to Oxford, where he was much e&s;teemed for his facetious com|pany; he kept a common victualling hou&s;e there, and thought he did great &s;ervice to the Royal cau&s;e, by writing Pa&s;quils again&s;t the round-heads. After the garri&s;on of Oxford &s;urrendered, he retired to We&s;tmin&s;ter, kept a public hou&s;e in Phaenix Alley near Long Acre, and continued con&s;tant in his loyalty to the King: after who&s;e death, he &s;et|up a &s;ign over his door, of a mourning crown, but that proving offen&s;ive, he pulled it down, and hung up his own picture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Athen. Oxon. vol. ii. p. 393.</NOTE>, under which were the&s;e words,<Q><L>There's many a head &s;tands for a &s;ign,</L>

<L>The laurel wreath, the poet's hire.</L></Q></P>
<P>He died in the year 1654, aged 74, and was buried in the church yard of St. Paul's Covent-Garden; his nephew, a Painter at Oxford, who lived in Wood's time, informed him of this circum&s;tance, who gave his picture to the &s;chool gallery there, where it now hangs, &s;hewing
<PB N="11" REF="14">
him to have had a quick and &s;mart countenance. The following epitaph was written upon him,<Q><LG TYPE="epitaph">

Lond. 1640, in a thin folio, written and publi&s;hed at the de&s;ire of King Charles I. which in the opinion of &s;ome critics of that age, was too florid for hi&s;tory, and fell &s;hort of that calm dignity which is peculiar to a good hi&s;torian, and which in our nation has never been more happily attained than by the great Earl of Cla|rendon and Bi&s;hop Burnet. During the civil war, Mr. Habington, according to Wood, temporized with tho&s;e in power, and was not unknown to Oli|ver Cromwell; but there is no account of his being rai&s;ed to any preferment during the Protector's government. He died the 30th of November, 1654.</ITEM>

He &s;tiles it a Tragedy, notwith&s;tand|ing it ends &s;ucce&s;sfully, and quotes for his autho|rity in &s;o doing, Ae&s;ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lus, Euripides, and even Vo&s;|&s;ius, in his own Art of Poetry. Some make it a Que&s;ti|on, whether it be lawful to found a dramatic Poem on any &s;acred &s;ubject, and &s;ome people of tender con&s;ciences have murmured again&s;t this Play, and another of the &s;ame ca&s;t called Chri&s;t's Pa&s;&s;ion; but let us hear the opinion of Vo&s;&s;ius him&s;elf, prefixed to this Play. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am of opinion, (&s;ays he) it is better to chu&s;e another argument than &s;acred. For it agrees not with the maje&s;ty of &s;acred things, to be made a play and a fable. It is al&s;o a work of very dangerous con&s;equence, to min|gle human inventions with things &s;acred; becau&s;e the poet adds uncertainties of his own, &s;ometimes fal&s;ities; which is not only to play with holy things, but al&s;o to graft in men's minds opini|ons, now and then fal&s;e. The&s;e things have place, e&s;pecially when we bring in God, or Chri&s;t &s;peaking, or treating of the my&s;teries of religion. I will allow more where the hi&s;tory is taken out of the &s;acred &s;criptures; but yet in the nature of the argument is civil, as the ac|tion of David flying from his &s;on Ab&s;olom; or of Jo&s;eph &s;old by his brethren, advanced by Pharaoh to the government of Egypt, and that dignity adored by, and made known unto his brethren. Of which argument is Sophompaneas, written by Hugo Grotius, emba&s;&s;ador from the Queen of Sweden to the King of France; which tragedy, I &s;uppo&s;e, may be &s;et for a pattern to him, that would handle an argument from the holy &s;criptures."</Q> This is the opinion of Vo&s;&s;ius, and with him all mu&s;t agree who admire the truly admirable Sam&s;on Agoni&s;tes of Milton.</P>
<P>As we have frequently mentioned Grotius, the &s;hort account of &s;o great a man, which is in&s;erted in Langbaine, will not be unplea&s;ing to the reader. <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><PB N="15" REF="18">"Hugo Grotius, &s;ays he, was an honour to his country: he was born in the year 1583, and will be famous to po&s;terity, in regard of tho&s;e many excellent pieces he has publi&s;hed. In &s;ome of his writings he de&s;ended Armini|ani&s;m, for which he &s;uffered impri&s;onment in the ca&s;tle of Louver&s;tein, in the year 1618; at which time his a&s;&s;ociate Barnevelt lo&s;t his head on the &s;ame account. Afterwards Grotius e&s;cap|ed out of pri&s;on, by means of Maria Reiger&s;berg his wife, and fled into Flanders; and thence in|to France, where he was kindly received by Lewis XIII. He died at Ro&s;tock in Mecclebourg, Sept. 1, 1645. His life is written at large by Melchoir Adamus, in Latin."</Q></P>

<P>WAS the &s;on of a vicar of Hinkley, in Leice&s;ter|&s;hire, where he was born, and received his grammatical education, under one Mr. Richard Vines, a zealous Puritan.

He continued there about nine years, and made during that time &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful attempts in poetry. At length, upon the eruption of the civil war, he was the fir&s;t who e&s;|pou&s;ed the Royal cau&s;e in ver&s;e, again&s;t the Pre&s;|byterians, who per&s;ecuted him in their turn with more &s;olid &s;everity; for he was ejected, ar &s;oon as the reins of power were in their hands. Dr. Fuller be&s;tows upon our author the mo&s;t lavi&s;h panegyric: He was (&s;ays he) a general arti&s;t, pure latini&s;t, an exqui&s;ite orator, and what was his ma&s;|ter-piece, an eminent poet.

<P>In the year 1618 he went as chaplain to Sir Francis Stewart, when he accompanied to Spain the Count Gundamore, after he had continued &s;everal Years at our court as emba&s;&s;ador, in which journey Holyday behaved in a facetious and plea|&s;ant manner, which ingratiated him in the fa|vour of Gundamore<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Wood ubi &s;upra.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>JAMES SHIRLEY,</HEAD>
<P>A VERY voluminous dramatic author, was born in the city of London, and was de|&s;cended from the Shirleys in Su&s;&s;ex or Warwick|&s;hire; he was educated in grammar learning in Merchant Taylors &s;chool, and tran&s;planted thence to St. John's College, but in what &s;tation he lived there, we don't find.</P>
<P>Dr. William Laud, afterwards archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, pre&s;iding over that hou&s;e, conceived a great affection for our author, and was willing to cheri&s;h and improve tho&s;e promi&s;ing abilities ear|ly di&s;coverable in him. Mr. Shirley had always an inclination to enter into holy orders, but, for a very particular rea&s;on, was di&s;couraged from at|tempting it by Dr. Laud; this rea&s;on to &s;ome may appear whim&s;ical and ridiculous, but has certainly much weight and force in it.</P>
<P>Shirley had unfortunately a large mole upon his left cheek, which much disfigured him, and gave him a very forbidding appearance. Laud ob&s;erved very ju&s;tly, that an audience can &s;carce help con|ceiving a prejudice again&s;t a man who&s;e appear|ance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hocks them, and were he to preach with the tongue of an angel, that prejudice could ne|ver be &s;urmounted; be&s;ides the danger of women with child fixing their eyes on him in the pulpit, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d as the imagination of pregnant women has &s;trange influence on the unborn infants, it is &s;omewhat cruel to expo&s;e them to that danger, and by the&s;e means do them great injury, as

ones fortune in &s;ome mea&s;ure depends upon ex|terior comeline&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Athen. Oxon. p. 376.</NOTE>. But Shirley, who was re&s;o|lute to be in orders, left that univer&s;ity &s;oon af|ter, went to Cambridge, there took the degrees in arts, and became a mini&s;ter near St. Alban's in Hertford&s;hire; but never having examined the au|thority, and purity of the Prote&s;tant Church, and being deluded by the &s;ophi&s;try of &s;ome Romi&s;h prie&s;ts, he changed his religion for theirs<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Wood, ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>, quit|ted his living, and taught a grammar &s;chool in the town of St. Alban's; which employment he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">ding an intolerable drudgery, and being of a fickle un&s;teady temper, he relinqui&s;hed it, came up to London, and took lodgings in Gray's Inn, where he commenced a writer for the &s;tage with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s. He had the good fortune to gain &s;everal wealthy and beneficent patrons, e&s;pe|cially Henrietta Maria the Queen Con&s;ort, who made him her &s;ervant.</P>
<P>When the civil war broke out, he was driven from London, and attended upon his Royal Mi&s;tre&s;s, while his wife and family were left in a deplorable condition behind him. Some time after that, when the Queen of England was forced, by the fury of oppo&s;ition, to &s;ollicit &s;uccours from France, in order to rein&s;tate her hu&s;band; our author could no longer wait upon her, and was received into the &s;ervice of William Cavendi&s;h, marquis of Newca&s;tle, to take his for|tune with him in the wars. That noble &s;pirited patron had given him &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of his liberality, as Shirley thought him&s;elf happy in his &s;ervice, e&s;pecially as by the&s;e means he could at the &s;ame time &s;erve the King.</P>
<P>Having mentioned Henrietta Maria, Shirley's Royal Mi&s;tre&s;s, the reader will pardon a digre&s;&s;ion, which flows from tenderne&s;s, and is no more than an expre&s;&s;ion of humanity. Her life-time in Eng|land

was embittered with a continued per&s;ecution; &s;he lived to &s;ee the unhappy death of her Lord; &s;he witne&s;&s;ed her exiled &s;ons, not only oppre&s;&s;ed with want, but obliged to quit France, at the remon|&s;trance of Cromwel's amba&s;&s;ador; &s;he her&s;elf was loaded with poverty, and as Voltaire ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was driven to the mo&s;t calamitous &s;ituation that ever poor lady was expo&s;ed to; &s;he was obliged to &s;ollicit Cromwel to pay her an allowance, as Queen Dowager of England, which, no doubt, &s;he had a right to demand; but to de|mand it, nay wor&s;e, to be obliged to beg it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> a man who &s;hed her Hu&s;band's blood upon a &s;caffold, is an affliction, &s;o exce&s;&s;ively height|ened, that few of the human race ever bore one &s;o &s;evere."</Q></P>
<P>After an active &s;ervice under the marquis of Newca&s;tle, and the King's cau&s;e declining beyond hope of recovery, Shirley came again to London, and in order to &s;upport him&s;elf and family, re|&s;umed his former occupation of teaching a &s;chool, in White Fryars, in which he was pretty &s;ucce&s;s|ful, and, as Wood &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">'educated many ingeni|ous youths, who, afterwards in various faculties, became eminent.'</Q> After the Re&s;toration, &s;ome of the plays our author had written in his lei&s;ure moments, were repre&s;ented with &s;ucce&s;s, but there is no account whether that giddy Monarch ever rewarded him for his loyalty, and indeed it is more probable he did not, as he pur&s;ued the duke of Lauderdale's maxim too clo&s;ely, of making friends of his enemies, and &s;uffering his friends to &s;hift for them&s;elves, which infamous maxim drew down di&s;honour on the admini&s;tration and govern|ment of Charles II. Wood further remarks, that Shirley much a&s;&s;i&s;ted his patron, the duke of New|ca&s;tle, in the compo&s;ition of his plays, which the duke afterwards publi&s;hed, and was a drudge to John Ogilby in his tran&s;lation of Homer's Iliad

and Ody&s;&s;eys, by writing annotations on them. At length, after Mr. Shirley had lived to the age of 72, in various conditions, having been much agitated in the world, he, with his &s;econd wife, was driven by the di&s;mal conflagration that hap|pened in London, Anno 1666, from his habita|tion in Fleet-&s;treet, to another in St. Giles's in the Fields. Where, being overcome with mi&s;eries occa|&s;ioned by the fire, and bending beneath the weight of years, they both died in one day, and their bodies were buried in one grave, in the church|yard of St. Giles's, on October 29, 1666.</P>

<HEAD>JAMES HOWEL, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>WAS born at Abernant in Carmarthen&s;hire, the place where his father was mini&s;ter, in the year 1594<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Langbaine's Lives of the Poets.</NOTE>. Howel him&s;elf, in one of his familiar epi&s;tles, &s;ays, that his a&s;cendant was that hot con&s;tellation of Cancer about the middle of the Dog Days. After he was educated in grammar learning in the free &s;chool of Hereford, he was &s;ent to Je&s;us College in the beginning of 1610, took a degree in arts, and then quitted the uni|ver&s;ity. By the help of friends and a &s;mall &s;um of money his father a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with, he tra|velled for three years into &s;everal countries, where he improved him&s;elf in the various languages; &s;ome years after his return, the reputation of his

parts was &s;o great, that he was made choice of to be &s;ent into Spain, to recover of the Spani&s;h monarch a rich Engli&s;h &s;hip, &s;eized by the Vice|roy of Sardinia for his ma&s;ter's u&s;e, upon &s;ome pretence of prohibited goods being found in it.</P>
<P>During his ab&s;ence, he was elected Fellow of Je|&s;us College, 1623, and upon his return, was pa|tronized by Emanuel, lord Scroop, Lord Pre&s;i|dent of the North, and by him was made his &s;e|cretary<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Athen. Oxon. p. 281. vol. ii.</NOTE>. As he re&s;ided in York, he was, by the Mayor and Aldermen of Richmond, cho&s;e a Burge&s;s for their Corporation to &s;it in that Parlia|ment, that began at We&s;tmin&s;ter in the year 1627. Four years after, he went &s;ecretary to Robert, earl of Leice&s;ter, amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary from Eng|land to the King of Denmark, before whom he made &s;everal Latin &s;peeches, &s;hewing the occa&s;ion of their emba&s;&s;y, viz. to condole the death of Sophia, Queen Dowager of Denmark, Grandmother to Charles I. King of England.</P>
<P>Our author enjoyed many beneficial employments, and at length, about the beginning of the civil war, was made one of the clerks of the council, but being extravagant in his temper, all the money he got was not &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve him from a Jail. When the King was forced from the Parliament, and the Royal intere&s;t declined, Howel was arre&s;ted, by order of a certain committee, who owed him no good will, and carried pri&s;oner to the Fleet; and having now nothing to depend upon but his wits, he was obliged to write and tran&s;late books for a livelihood, which brought him in, &s;ays Wood, a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, during his &s;tay there; he is the fir&s;t per&s;on we have met with, in the cour&s;e of this work, who may be &s;aid to have made a trade of author&s;hip, having written no le&s;s than 49 books on different &s;ubjects.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37">
In the time of the rebellion, we find Howel tampering with the prevailing power, and ready to have embraced their mea&s;ures; for which rea|&s;on, at the re&s;toration, he was not contined in his place of clerk to the council, but was only made king's hi&s;toriographer, being the fir&s;t in England, &s;ays Wood, who bore that title; and hav|ing no very beneficial employment, he wrote books to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>He had a great knowledge in modern hi&s;tories, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e of the countries in which he had travelled, and he &s;eems, by his letters, to have been no contemptible politician: As to his poetry, it is &s;moother, and more harmonious, than was ve|ry common with the bards of his time.</P>
<P>As he introduced the trade of writing for bread, &s;o he al&s;o is charged with venal flattery, than which nothing can be more ignoble and ba&s;e. To prai&s;e a blockhead's wit becau&s;e he is great, is too frequently practi&s;ed by authors, and de&s;ervedly draws down contempt upon them. He who is favoured and patronized by a great man, at the expence of his integrity and honour, has paid a dear price for the purcha&s;e, a mi&s;erable exchange, patronage for virtue, dependance for freedom.</P>
<P>Our author died the beginning of November, 1666, and was buried on the North &s;ide of the Temple church.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not trouble the reader with an enume|ration of all the tran&s;lations and pro&s;e works of this author; the occa&s;ion of his being introduced here, is, his having written</P>

<P>WAS the younge&s;t, and tenth &s;on of Sir Hen|ry Fan&s;haw of Ware-park in Hertford|&s;hire; he was born in the year 1607, and was in|itiated in learning by the famous Thomas Farna|by. He afterwards compleated his &s;tudies in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, and from thence went to travel into foreign countries, by which means he became a very accompli&s;hed gentleman. In 1635 he was patronized by King Charles I. on ac|count of his early and promi&s;ing abilities; he took him into his &s;ervice, and appointed him re&s;i|dent at the court of Spain<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Short Account of Sir Richard Fan&s;haw, prefixed to his Letters.</NOTE>.

and puni&s;hment of &s;ome free-booters, who had taken &s;hips from the Engli&s;h, and to endea|vour the re&s;toration of amity, trade and commerce.</P>
<P>When the civil war broke out, he returned to England, having accompli&s;hed the purpo&s;es of his emba&s;&s;y abroad, and attached him&s;elf with the ut|mo&s;t zeal to the Royal Standard; and during tho&s;e calamitous times was intru&s;ted with many import|ant matters of &s;tate.</P>
<P>In 1644, attending the court at Oxford, the de|gree of Doctor of Civil Laws was conferred upon him<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Wood, Fa&s;t. ed. 1721, vol. ii. col. 43, 44.</NOTE>, and the reputation of his parts every day increa&s;ing, he was thought a proper per&s;on to be &s;ecretary to Charles, Prince of Wales, whom he attended into the We&s;tern parts of England, and from thence into the I&s;les of Scilly and Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P>In 1648 he was appointed trea&s;urer of the navy, under the command of Prince Rupert, in which office he continued till the year 1650, when he was created a baronet by King Charles II. and &s;ent envoy extraordinary to the court of Spain. Being recalled thence into Scotland, where the King then was, he &s;erved there in quality of &s;e|cretary of &s;tate, to the &s;atisfaction of all parties, notwith&s;tanding he refu&s;ed to take the covenant engagements, which Charles II. forced by the im|portunity of the Pre&s;byterians, entered into, with a re&s;olution to break them. In 1651 he was made pri&s;oner at the battle of Worce&s;ter and commit|ted to clo&s;e cu&s;tody in London, where he conti|nued, 'till his confinement introduced a very dan|gerous &s;ickne&s;s; he then had liberty granted him, upon giving bail, to go for the recovery of his health, into any place he &s;hould chu&s;e, provided he &s;tirred not five miles from thence, without leave from the Parliament.</P>
<P>In February, 1659, he repaired to the King at

Breda, who knighted him the April following. Upon his Maje&s;ty's re&s;toration, it was expected, from his great &s;ervices, and the regard the King had for him, that he would have been made &s;ecretary of &s;tate, but at that period there were &s;o many people's merits to repay, and &s;o great a clamour for preferment, that Sir Richard was di&s;appointed, but had the place of ma&s;ter of reque&s;ts conferred on him, a &s;tation, in tho&s;e times, of con&s;iderable profit and dignity.</P>

In 1661, being one of the burge&s;&s;es for the univer|&s;ity of Cambridge, he was &s;worn a privy coun|&s;ellor for Ireland, and having by his re&s;idence in fo|reign parts, qualified him&s;elf for public employment, he was &s;ent envoy extraordinary to Portugal, with a dormant commi&s;&s;ion to the amba&s;&s;ador, which he was to make u&s;e of as occa&s;ion &s;hould require. Shortly after, he was appointed amba&s;&s;ador to that court, where he negotiated the marriage be|tween his ma&s;ter King Charles II. and the In|fanta Donna Catharina, daughter to King John VI. and towards the end of the &s;ame year he re|turned to England. We are a&s;&s;ured by Wood, that in the year 1662, he was &s;ent again amba&s;|fador to that court, and when he had fini&s;hed his commi&s;&s;ion, to the mutual &s;atisfaction of Charles II. and Alphon&s;o King of Portugal, being recalled in 1663, he was &s;worn one of his Maje&s;ty's Privy Council. In the beginning of the year 1644 he was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to Philip IV. King of Spain, and arrived February 29 at Cadiz, where he met with a very extraordinary and unexpected &s;aluta|tion, and was received with &s;ome circum&s;tances of particular e&s;teem. It appears from one of Sir Richard's letters, that this di&s;tingui&s;hing re&s;pect was paid him, not only on his own, but on his
<PB N="39" REF="42">
ma&s;ter's account; and in another of his letters he di&s;covers the &s;ecret why the Spaniard yielded him, contrary to his imperious proud nature, &s;o much honour, and that is, that he expected Tangier and Jamaica to be re&s;tored to him by England, which occa&s;ioned his arrival to be &s;o impatiently long|ed for, and magnificently celebrated. During his re&s;idence at this court King Philip died, September 17, 1665, leaving his &s;on Charles an infant, and his dominions under the regency of his queen, Mary Anne, daughter of the emperor Fer|dinand III. Sir Richard taking the advantage of his minority, put the fini&s;hing hand to a peace with Spain, which was &s;ufficiently tired and weak|ened with a 25 years war, for the recovery of Por|tugal, which had been di&s;membered from the Spa|ni&s;h crown in 1640; the treaty of peace was &s;igned at Madrid December 6, 1665. About the 14th of January following, his excellency took a journey into Portugal, where he &s;taid till towards the end of March; the de&s;ign of his journey cer|tainly was to effect an accommodation between that crown and Spain, which however was not produced till 1667, by the interpo&s;ition of his Bri|tannic Maje&s;ty. Our author having fini&s;hed his commi&s;&s;ion was preparing for his return to Eng|land, when June 4, 1666, he was &s;eized at Madrid with a violent fever, which put an end to his valuable life, the 16th of the &s;ame month, the ve|ry day he intended to &s;et out for England: his bo|dy being embalmed, it was conveyed by his lady, and all his children, then living, by land to Ca|lais, and &s;o to London, whence being carried to All Saints church in Hertford, it was depo&s;ited in the vault of his father-in-law, Sir John Harri&s;on.

<P>It is remarkable of Mr. Cowley, as he him&s;elf tells us, that he had this defect in his memory, that his teachers could never bring him to retain the ordinary rules of grammar, the want of which, however, he abundantly &s;upplied by an inti|mate acquaintance with the books them&s;elves, from whence tho&s;e rules had been drawn. In 1636 he was removed to Trinity College in Cambridge, being elected a &s;cholar of that hou&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on him&s;elf.</NOTE>. His exer|ci&s;es of all kinds were highly applauded, with this peculiar prai&s;e, that they were fit, not only for the ob&s;curity of an academical life, but to have made their appearance on the true theatre of the world; and there he laid the de&s;igns, and formed the plans of mo&s;t of the ma&s;culine, and excellent attempts he afterwards happily fini&s;hed. In 1638 he publi&s;hed his Love's Riddle, written at the time of his being a &s;cholar in We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, and dedicated by a copy of ver&s;es to Sir Kenelm Dig|by. He al&s;o wrote a Latin Comedy entitled Nau|fragium Joculare, or the Merry Shipwreck. The fir&s;t occa&s;ion of his entering into bu&s;ine&s;s, was, an elegy he wrote on the death of Mr. William Harvey, which introduced him to the acquaintance of Mr. John Harvey, the brother of his decea&s;ed friend, from whom he received many offices of kindne&s;s through the whole cour&s;e of his life<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Sprat's Account of Cowley.</NOTE>. In 1643, being then ma&s;ter of arts, he was, a|mong many others, ejected his college, and the uni|ver&s;ity; whereupon, retiring to Oxford, he &s;ettled
<PB N="45" REF="48">
in St. John's College, and that &s;ame year, under the name of a &s;cholar of Oxford, publi&s;hed a &s;a|tire entitled the Puritan and the Papi&s;t. His zeal in the Royal cau&s;e, engaged him in the &s;ervice of the King, and he was pre&s;ent in many of his Maje&s;ty's journies and expeditions; by this means he gained an acquaintance and familiarity with the per&s;onages of the court and of the gown, and particularly had the entire friend&s;hip of my lord Falkland, one of the principal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate.</P>
<P>During the heat of the civil war, he was &s;et|tled in the family of the earl of St. Alban's, and accompanied the Queen Mother, when &s;he was obliged to retire into France. He was ab&s;ent from his native country, &s;ays Wood, about ten years, during which time, he laboured in the affai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the Royal Family, and bore part of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es inflicted upon the illu&s;trious Exiles: for this pur|po&s;e he took &s;everal dangerous journies into Jer|&s;ey, Scotland, Flanders, Holland, and el&s;ewhere, and was the principal in&s;trument in maintaining a corre&s;pondence between the King and his Royal Con&s;ort, who&s;e letters he cyphered and decyphered with his own hand.</P>
<P>His poem called the Mi&s;tre&s;s was publi&s;hed at London 1647, of which he him&s;elf &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it was compo&s;ed when he was very young. Poets (&s;ays he) are &s;carce thought free men of their company, without paying &s;ome duties and ob|liging them&s;elves to be true to love. Sooner or later they mu&s;t all pa&s;s through that trial, like &s;ome Mahometan monks, who are bound by their order once at lea&s;t in their life, to make a pilgrimage to Mecca. But we mu&s;t not always make a judgment of their manners from their writings of this kind, as the Romani&s;ts uncharitably do of Beza for a few la&s;civious
<PB N="46" REF="49">
&s;onnets compo&s;ed by him in his youth. It is not in this &s;en&s;e that poetry is &s;aid to be a kind of painting: It is not the picture of the poet but of things, and per&s;ons imagined by him. He may be in his practice and di&s;po&s;i|tion a philo&s;opher, and yet &s;ometimes &s;peak with the &s;oftne&s;s of an amorous Sappho. I would not be mi&s;under&s;tood, as if I affected &s;o much gravity as to be a&s;hamed to be thought really in love. On the contrary, I cannot have a good opinion of any man who is not at lea&s;t capable of being &s;o."</Q></P>
<P>What opinion Dr. Sprat had of Mr. Cowley's Mi&s;tre&s;s, appears by the following pa&s;&s;age extrac|ted from his Life of Cowley. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If there need|ed any excu&s;e to be made that his love-ver|&s;es took up &s;o great a &s;hare in his works, it may be alledged that they were compo&s;ed when he was very young; but it is a vain thing to make any kind of apology for that &s;ort of writing. If devout or virtuous men will &s;u|perciliou&s;ly forbid the minds of the young to adorn tho&s;e &s;ubjects about which they are mo&s;t conver&s;ant, they would put them out of all ca|pacity of performing graver matters, when they come to them: for the exerci&s;e of all men's wit mu&s;t be always proper for their age, and never too much above it, and by practice and u&s;e in lighter arguments, they grow up at la&s;t to excell in the mo&s;t weighty. I am not there|fore a&s;hamed to commend Mr. Cowley's Mi&s;|tre&s;s. I only except one or two expre&s;&s;ions, which I wi&s;h I could have prevailed-with tho&s;e that had the right of the other edition to have left out; but of all the re&s;t, I dare boldly pronounce, that never yet was written &s;o much on a &s;ubject &s;o delicate, that can le&s;s offend the &s;evere&s;t rules of morality. The whole pa&s;|&s;ion of love is intimately de&s;cribed by all its
<PB N="47" REF="50">
mighty train of hopes, joys and di&s;quiets. Be|&s;ides this amorous tenderne&s;s, I know not how in every copy there is &s;omething of more u&s;eful knowledge gracefully in&s;inuated; and every where there is &s;omething &s;eigned to in|form the minds of wi&s;e men, as well as to move the hearts of young men or women."</Q></P>
<P>Our author's comedy, named the Guardian, he afterwards altered, and publi&s;hed under the title of the Cutter of Coleman-Street. Langbaine &s;ays, notwith&s;tanding Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">owley's mode&s;t opinion of this play, it was acted not only at Cambridge, but &s;everal times afterwards privately, during the prohibition of the &s;tage, and after the King's return publickly at Dublin; and always with ap|plau&s;e. It was this probably that put the au|thor upon revi&s;ing it; after which he permitted it to appear publickly on the &s;tage under a new title, at his royal highne&s;s the Duke of York's theatre. It met with oppo&s;ition at fir&s;t from &s;ome who envied the author's un&s;haken loyalty; but afterwards it was acted with general applau&s;e, and was e&s;teemed by the critics an excellent comedy.</P>
<P>In the year 1656 it was judged proper by tho&s;e on whom Mr. Cowley depended, that he &s;hould come over into England, and under pre|tence of privacy and retirement, give notice of the &s;ituation of affairs in this nation.

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Which, &s;ays Dr. Sprat, was written in &s;o young an age, that if we &s;hall reflect on the va&s;tne&s;s of the argument, and his manner of hardling it, he may &s;eem like one of the miracles that he there adorns; like a boy at|tempting Goliah. This perhaps, may be the rea&s;on, that in &s;ome places, there may be more youthfulne&s;s and redundance of fancy, than his riper judgement would have allowed. But for the main of it I will affirm, that it is a bet|ter in&s;tance and beginning of a divine poem, than ever I yet &s;aw in any language. The contrivance is perfectly ancient, which is cer|tainly the true form of an heroic poem, and &s;uch as was never yet done by any new de|vices of modern wits. The &s;ubject was tru|ly divine, even according to God's own heart. The matters of his invention, all the trea&s;ures of knowledge and hi&s;tories of the bible. The model of it comprehended all the learning of the Ea&s;t. The characters lofty and various; the numbers firm and powerful; the digre&s;|&s;ions beautiful and proportionable. The de|&s;ign, to &s;ubmit mortal wit to heavenly truths. In all, there is an admirable mixture of hu|man virtues and pa&s;&s;ions with religious raptures. The truth is, continues Dr. Sprat, methinks in other matters his wit exceeded all other men's, but in his moral and divine works it out-did it&s;elf; and no doubt it proceeded from this cau&s;e, that in the lighter kinds of poetry he chiefly repre&s;ented the humours and affecti|ons of others; but in the&s;e he &s;at to him&s;elf, and drew the figure of his own mind. We have the fir&s;t book of the Davideis tran&s;lated out of Engli&s;h into very elegant Latin by Mr. Cowley him&s;elf."</Q> Dr. Sprat &s;ays of his Latin poetry, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he has expre&s;&s;ed to admiration all the numbers of ver&s;e and figures of poetry,

that are &s;cattered up and down among&s;t the ancients; and that there is hardly to be found in them any good fa&s;hion of &s;peech, or colour of mea&s;ure; but he has comprehended it, and given in&s;tances of it, according as his &s;everal arguments required either a maje&s;tic &s;pirit, or pa&s;&s;ionate, or plea&s;ant. This he ob&s;erves, is the more extraordinary, in that it was never yet performed by any &s;ingle poet of the an|cient Romans them&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame author has told us, that the occa|&s;ion of Mr. Cowley's falling on the pindarique way of writing, was his accidentally meeting with Pindar's works in a place where he had no other books to direct him. Having thus con&s;idered at lei&s;ure the heighth of his invention, and the maje&s;ty of his &s;tile, he tried immediately to imi|tate it in Engli&s;h, and he performed it, &s;ays the Dr. without the danger that Horace pre&s;aged to the man that &s;hould attempt it. Two of our greate&s;t poets, after allowing Mr. Cowley to have been a &s;ucce&s;sful imitator of Pindar, yet find fault with his numbers. Mr. Dryden having told us, that our author brought Pindaric ver&s;e as near perfection as po&s;&s;ible in &s;o &s;hort a time, adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But if I may be allowed to &s;peak my mind mode&s;tly, and without injury to his &s;acred a&s;hes, &s;omewhat of the purity of Engli&s;h, &s;ome|what of more &s;weetne&s;s in the numbers, in a word, &s;omewhat of a finer turn and more ly|rical ver&s;e is yet wanting;"</Q> and Mr. Congreve having excepted again&s;t the irregularity of the mea&s;ure of the Engli&s;h Pindaric odes, yet ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the beauty of Mr. Cowley's ver&s;es are an attonement for the irregularity of his &s;tanzas; and tho' he did not imitate Pindar in the &s;trict|ne&s;s of his numbers, he has very often happily copied him in the force of his figures, and &s;ublimity of his &s;tile and &s;entiments."</Q></P>

This account is a &s;uffici|ent vindication of Mr. Cowley's un&s;haken loyalty, which &s;ome called in que&s;tion; and as this is a material circum&s;tance in the life of Cowley, we &s;hall give an account of it in the words of the elegant writer of his life ju&s;t now mentioned, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;et it in a fairer, or more &s;triking light than is already done by that ex|cellent prelate. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The cau&s;e of his loyalty be|ing called in que&s;tion, he tells us, was a &s;ew lines in a preface to one of his books; the objection, &s;ays he, I mu&s;t not pa&s;s in &s;ilence, becau&s;e it was the only part of his life that was liable to mi&s;interpretation, even by the confe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e that envied his &s;ame." <P>"In this ca&s;e it were enough to alledge for him to men of moderate minds, that what he there &s;aid was publi&s;hed before a book of poetry; and &s;o ought rather to be e&s;teemed as a problem of his fancy and invention, than as a cal image of his judgement; but his de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ce in this matter may be laid on a &s;urer

foundation. This is the true rea&s;on to be given of his delivering that opinion: Upon his coming over he found the &s;tate of the royal party very de&s;perate. He perceived the &s;trength of their enemies &s;o united, that till it &s;hould begin to break within it&s;elf, all endea|vours again&s;t it were like to prove un&s;ucce&s;s|ful. On the other &s;ide he beheld their zeal for his Maje&s;ty's cau&s;e to be &s;till &s;o active, that often hurried them into inevitable ruin. He &s;aw this with much grief; and tho' he approved their con&s;tancy as much as any man living, yet he found their unrea&s;onable &s;hew|ing it, did only di&s;able them&s;elves, and give their adver&s;aries great advantages of riches and &s;trength by their defeats. He therefore believed it would be a meritorious &s;ervice to the King, if any man who was known to have follow|ed his intere&s;t, could in&s;inuate into the U&s;ur|per's minds, that men of his principles were now willing to be quiet, and could per&s;uade the poor oppre&s;&s;ed Royali&s;ts to conceal their af|fections for better occa&s;ions. And as for his own particular, he was a clo&s;e pri&s;oner when he writ that again&s;t which the exception is made; &s;o that he &s;aw it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to pur&s;ue the ends for which he came hither, if he did not make &s;ome kind of de|claration of his peaceable intentions. This was then his opinion; and the &s;ucce&s;s of the thing &s;eems to prove that it was not ill-grounded. For certainly it was one of the greate&s;t helps to the King's affairs about the latter end of that tyranny, that many of his be&s;t friends di&s;&s;embled their coun&s;els, and acted the &s;ame de&s;igns under the di&s;gui&s;es and names of other parties.

<P>About the year 1662, his two Books of Plants were publi&s;hed, to which he added afterwards fourmore, and all the&s;e together, with his Latin poems, were printed in London. 16-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">; his Books on Plants was written dur|ing his re&s;idence in England, in the time of the u&s;urpation, the better to di&s;tingui&s;h his real inten|tion, by the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, to which he applied.</P>
<P>It appears by Wood's Fa&s;ti Oxon. that our poet was created Dr. of Phy&s;ic at Oxford, De|cember 2, 1637, by virtue of a mandamus from the then government.

for a retreat, he &s;pent the la&s;t &s;even or eight years of his life in his beloved ob&s;curity, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed (&s;ays Sprat) that &s;olitude, which from his very childhood he &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired. This great poet, and worthy man, died at a hou&s;e call|ed the Porch-hou&s;e, towards the We&s;t end of the town of Chert&s;ey in Surry, July 28, 1667, in the 49th year of his age. His &s;olitude, from the very beginning, had never agreed &s;o well with the con|&s;titution of his body, as his mind: out of ha&s;te, to abandon the tumult of the city, he had not pre|pared a healthful &s;ituation in the country, as he might have done, had he been more deliberate in his choice; of this, he &s;oon began to find the in|convenience at Barn-elms, where he was afflicted with a dangerous and lingring fever. Shortly after his removal to Chert&s;ey, he fell into another con|&s;uming di&s;ea&s;e: having langui&s;hed under this for &s;ome months, he &s;eemed to be pretty well cured of its ill &s;ymptoms, but in the heat of the &s;ummer, by &s;taying too long among&s;t his labourers in the meadows, he was taken with a violent defluxion, and &s;toppage in his brea&s;t and throat; this he ne|glected, as an ordinary cold, and refu&s;ed to &s;end for his u&s;ual phy&s;icians, 'till it was pa&s;t all remedy, and &s;o in the end, after a &s;ortnight's &s;ickne&s;s, it proved mortal to him.</P>
<P>He was buried in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, the 3d of Augu&s;t following, near the a&s;hes of Chaucer and Spen&s;er. King Charles II. was plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon him the be&s;t character, when, upon the news of his death, his Maje&s;ty declared, that Mr. Cow|ley had not left a better man behind him in Eng|land. A monument was erected to his memory in May 1675, by George, duke of Buckingham, with a Latin in&s;cription, written by Dr. Sprat, after|wards lord bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter.</P>

Mr. Cowley had de&s;igned a Di&s;cour&s;e on Stile, and a Review of the Prin|ciples of the Primitive Chri&s;tian Church, but was prevented by death. In Mr. Dryden's Mi&s;cellany Poems, we find a poem on the Civil War, &s;aid to be written by our author, but not extant in any edition of his works: Dr. Sprat mentions, as very excellent in their kind, Mr. Cowley's Letters to his private friends, none of which were publi&s;hed. As a poet, Mr. Cowley has had tribute paid him from the greate&s;t names in all knowledge, Dryden, Addi&s;on, Sir John Denham, and Pope. He is blamed for a redundance of wit, and roughne&s;s of ver&s;ification, but is allowed to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a fine under&s;tanding, great reading, and a variety of genius. Let us &s;ee how Mr. Addi&s;on characterizes him in his Account of the great Engli&s;h Poets.<Q><L>Great Cowley then (a mighty genius) wrote,</L>
<L>O'errun with wit, and lavi&s;h of his thought;</L>
<L>His turns too clo&s;ely on the readers pre&s;s,</L>

<P>In his public capacity, he pre&s;erved an inviola|ble honour and loyalty, and exerted great activity,
<PB N="55" REF="58">
with di&s;cernment: in private life, he was ea&s;y of acce&s;s, gentle, polite, and mode&s;t; none but his intimate friends ever di&s;covered, by his di&s;cour&s;e, that he was a great poet; he was generous in his di&s;po&s;ition, temperate in his life, devout and pi|ous in his religion, a warm friend, and a &s;ocial companion. Such is the character of the great Mr. Cowley, who de&s;erves the highe&s;t gratitude from po&s;terity, as well for his public as private con|duct. He never pro&s;tituted his mu&s;e to the purpo&s;es of lewdne&s;s and folly, and it is with plea&s;ure we can except him from the general, and too ju&s;t, charge brought again&s;t the poets, That they have a|bilities to do the greate&s;t &s;ervice, and by mi&s;di|recting them, too frequently fawn the harlot face of loo&s;e indulgence, and by dre&s;&s;ing up plea&s;ure in an elegant attire, procure votaries to her altar, who pay too dear for gazing at the &s;hewy phantom by lo&s;s of their virtue. It is no compliment to the ta&s;te of the pre&s;ent age, that the works of Mr. Cowley are falling into di&s;e&s;teem; they certainly contain more wit, and good &s;en&s;e, than the works of many other poets, whom it is now fa&s;hionable to read; that kind of poetry, which is known by the name of Light, he &s;ucceeds beyond any of his cotem|poraries, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; no love ver&s;es, in our lan|guage, have &s;o much true wit, and expre&s;&s;ive ten|derne&s;s, as Cowley's Mi&s;tre&s;s, which is indeed per|fect in its kind. What Mr. Addi&s;on ob&s;erves, is certainly true, <Q REND="inline">'He more had plea&s;ed us, had he plea&s;ed us le&s;s.'</Q> He had a &s;oul too full, an imagi|nation too fertile to be re&s;trained, and becau&s;e he has more wit than any other poet, an ordinary reader is &s;omehow di&s;po&s;ed to think he had le&s;s. In the particular of wit, none but Shake&s;pear e|ver exceeded Cowley, and he was certainly as cul|tivated a &s;cholar, as a great natural genius. In that kind of poetry which is grave, and demands ex|ten&s;ive thinking, no poet has a right to be compared
<PB N="56" REF="59">
with Cowley: Pope and Dryden, who are as remark|able for a force of thinking, as elegance of poe|try, are yet inferior to him; there are more ideas in one of Cowley's pindaric odes, than in any piece of equal length by tho&s;e two great genius's (St. Caecilia's ode excepted) and his pindaric odes being now neglected, can proceed from no other cau&s;e, than that they demand too much attention for a common reader, and contain &s;entiments &s;o &s;ublimely noble, as not to be comprehended by a vulgar mind; but to tho&s;e who think, and are ac|cu&s;tomed to contemplation, they appear great and ravi&s;hing. In order to illu&s;trate this, we &s;hall quote &s;pecimens in both kinds of poetry; the fir&s;t taken from his Mi&s;tre&s;s called Beauty, the other is a Hymn to Light, both of which, are &s;o excel|lent in their kind, that whoever reads them with|out rapture, may be well a&s;&s;ured, that he has no poetry in his &s;oul, and is in&s;en&s;ible to the flow of numbers, and the charms of &s;en&s;e.<Q><LG>

<HEAD>Sir WILLIAM DAVENANT.</HEAD>
<P>FEW poets have been &s;ubjected to more vari|ous turns of fortune, than the gentleman who&s;e memoirs we are now about to relate. He was a|mong&s;t the fir&s;t who refined our poetry, and did more for the intere&s;t of the drama, than any who ever wrote for the &s;tage. He lived in times of ge|neral confu&s;ion, and was no unactive member of the &s;tate, when its nece&s;&s;ities demanded his a&s;&s;i&s;|tance; and when, with the re&s;toration, politene&s;s and genius began to revive, he applied him&s;elf to the promotion of the&s;e rational plea&s;ures, which are fit to entertain a cultivated people. This great man was &s;on of one Mr. John Davenant, a citizen of Oxford, and was born in the month of Febru|ary, 1605; all the biographers of our poet have ob&s;erved, that his father was a man of a grave di&s;po&s;ition, and a gloomy turn of mind, which his &s;on did not inherit from him, for he was as re|markably volatile, as his father was &s;aturnine. The &s;ame biographers have celebrated our author's mo|ther as very hand&s;ome, who&s;e charms had the power of attracting the admiration of Shake&s;pear, the highe&s;t compliment which ever was paid to beauty. As Mr. Davenant, our poet's father, kept a tavern, Shake&s;pear, in his journies to Warwick|&s;hire, &s;pent &s;ome time there, influenced, as many believe, by the engaging qualities of the hand&s;ome landlady. This circum&s;tance has given ri&s;e to a conjecture, that Davenant was really the &s;on of Shake&s;pear, as well naturally as poetically, by an
<PB N="64" REF="67">
unlawful intrigue, between his mother and that great man; that this allegation is founded upon probability, no reader can believe, for we have &s;uch accounts of the amiable temper, and moral qualities of Shake&s;pear, that we cannot &s;uppo&s;e him to have been guilty of &s;uch an act of trea|chery, as violating the marriage honours; and how|ever he might have been delighted with the con|ver&s;ation, or charmed with the per&s;on of Mrs. Da|venant, yet as adultery was not then the fa&s;hion|able vice, it would be injurious to his memory, &s;o much as to &s;uppo&s;e him guilty.</P>
<P>Our author received the fir&s;t rudiments of polite learn|ing from Mr. Edward Sylve&s;ter, who kept a grammar &s;chool in the pari&s;h of All Saints in Oxford. In the year 1624, the &s;ame in which his father was Mayor of the city, he was entered a member of the univer&s;ity of Oxford, in Lincoln's-Inn College, under the tuition of Mr. Daniel Hough, but the Oxford an|tiquary is of opinion, he did not long remain there, as his mind was too much addicted to gaiety, to bear the au&s;terities of an academical life, and be|ing encouraged by &s;ome gentlemen, who admired the vivacity of his genius, he repaired to court, in hopes of making his fortune in that plea&s;ing, but dangerous element. He became fir&s;t page to Frances, duche&s;s of Richmond, a lady much cele|brated in tho&s;e days, as well for her beauty, as the influence &s;he had at court, and her extraordinary ta&s;te for grand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ur, which excited her to keep a kind of private court of her own, which, in our more fa&s;hionable aera, is known by the name of Drums, Routs, and Hurricanes. Sir William afterwards removed into the family of Sir Fulk Greville, lord Brooke, who being him&s;elf a man of ta&s;te and erudition, gave the mo&s;t encouraging marks of e&s;teem to our ri&s;ing bard. This worthy noble|man being brought to an immature fate, by the cruel hands of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, 1628, Davenant was
<PB N="65" REF="68">
left without a patron, though not in very indigent circum&s;tances, his reputation having increa&s;ed, during the time he was in his lord&s;hip's &s;ervice: the year en&s;uing the death of his patron, he pro|duced his fir&s;t play to the world, called Albovino, King of the Lombards, which met with a very general, and warm reception, and to which &s;ome very honourable recommendations were prefixed, when it was printed, in &s;everal copies of ver&s;es, by men of eminence, among&s;t whom, were, Sir Hen|ry Blount, Edward Hyde, afterwards earl of Cla|rendon, and the honourable Henry Howard. Our author &s;pent the next eight years of his life in a con&s;tant attendance upon court, where he was high|ly care&s;&s;ed by the mo&s;t &s;hining characters of the times, particularly by the earl of Dor&s;et, Edward Hyde, and Lord Trea&s;urer We&s;ton: during the&s;e gay moments, &s;pent in the court amu&s;ements, an unlucky accident happened to our author, which not a little deformed his face, which, from na|ture, was very hand&s;ome. Wood has affirmed, that this accident aro&s;e from libidinous dalliance with a hand&s;ome black girl in Axe-yard, We&s;tmin&s;ter. The plain fact is this, Davenant was of an amo|rous complexion, and was &s;o unlucky as to carry the marks of his regular gallantries in the depre&s;|&s;ion of his no&s;e; this expo&s;ed him to the plea&s;ant raillery of cotemporary wits, which very little af|fected him, and to &s;hew that he was undi&s;turbed by their merriment, he wrote a burle&s;que copy of ver&s;es upon him&s;elf. This accident happened pret|ty early in his life, &s;ince it gave occa&s;ion to the following &s;tanzas in Sir John Suckling's Se&s;&s;ions of the Poets, which we have tran&s;cribed from a correct copy of Suckling's works.<Q><LG>
<L>Will Davenant a&s;hamed of a fooli&s;h mi&s;chance,</L>
<L>That he had got lately travelling in France,</L>

<L>Surely the company had been content,</L>
<L>If they cou'd have found any precedent,</L>
<L>But in all their recor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters"> in ver&s;e, or pro&s;e,</L>
<L>There was none of a laureat, who wanted a no&s;e.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Suckling here differs from the Oxford hi&s;torian, in &s;aying that Sir William's di&s;order was contract|ed in France, but as Wood is the highe&s;t authori|ty, it is more rea&s;onable to embrace his ob&s;erva|tion, and probably, Suckling only mentioned France, in order that it might rhime with mi&s;|chance.</P>
<P>Some time after this, Davenant was rallied by another hand, on account of this accident, as if it had been a je&s;t that could never die; but what is more extraordinary, is, that Sir William him&s;elf could not forget the authore&s;s of this misfortune, but has introduced her in his Gondibert, and, in the opinion of &s;ome critics, very improperly. He brings two friends, Ulfinore the elder, and Goltho the younger, on a journey to the court of Gondi|bert, but in this pa&s;&s;age to &s;hew, as he would in|&s;inuate the extream frailty of youth, they were arre&s;ted by a very unexpected accident, notwith|&s;tanding the wi&s;e councils which Ulfinore had ju&s;t received from his father<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gond. b. iii. cant. 3. &s;tanz. 31.</NOTE>.

<P>During our author's attendance at court, he wrote &s;everal plays, and employed his time in framing ma&s;ques, which were acted by the princi|pal nobility of both &s;exes; the Queen her&s;elf con|de&s;cended to take a &s;hare in one of them, which gave very great offence to the &s;crupulous morali&s;ts, which &s;prung up in tho&s;e days; the particular ac|count of this dramatic piece we &s;hall give in the conclu&s;ion of his life, and now proceed in enume|rating the incidents of it.</P>
<P>Upon the death of Ben John&s;on, which happen|ed in the year 1637, our poet &s;ucceeded to his laurel, notwith&s;tanding the violent oppo&s;ition of his competitor Thomas May, who was &s;o extremely affected with his di&s;appointment, though he had been a zealous courtier, yet from re&s;entment to the Queen, by who&s;e intere&s;t Davenant was pre|ferred, he commenced an enemy to the King's par|ty, and became both an advocate and hi&s;torian for the Parliament.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the civil war broke out, Mr. Da|venant had an early &s;hare in them and demon|&s;trated his loyalty by &s;peaking and acting for the King. He was accu&s;ed by the Parliament for be|ing embarked in a de&s;ign in May 1641, of &s;e|ducing the army from their adherence to the par|liamentary authority, and bringing it again under the &s;ubjection of the King, and defence of his per&s;on. In this &s;cheme many of Sir William's friends were engaged, viz. Mr. Henry Piercy, af|terwards lord Piercy, Mr. Goring, Mr. Jermyn,
<PB N="69" REF="72">
Mr. A&s;hburnham, Sir John Suckling, and others: mo&s;t of the&s;e per&s;ons, upon their de&s;ign being di&s;co|vered, placed their &s;ecurity in flight, and Mr. Da|venant among&s;t the re&s;t; but a proclamation being publi&s;hed for apprehending him, he was &s;topped at Fever&s;ham, &s;ent up to town, and put into the cu|&s;tody of a &s;ergeant at arms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Athen. Oxon. vol. ii. col. 412.</NOTE>. In the month of July following, our author was bailed, and not long after finding it nece&s;&s;ary, on account of the violence of the times, to withdraw to France, he had the misfortune to be &s;eized again in Kent by the Mayor of Canterbury; how he e&s;caped the pre&s;ent danger, none of his biographers have re|lated, but it appears that he did not, upon this oc|ca&s;ion, &s;uffer long confinement; he at la&s;t retired beyond &s;ea, where he continued for &s;ome time, but the Queen &s;ending over a con&s;iderable quantity of military &s;tores, for the u&s;e of the earl of New|ca&s;tle's army, Mr. Davenant returned again to England, offered his &s;ervice to that noble peer, who was his old friend and patron, and by him made lieutenant-general of his ordnance: this pro|motion gave offence to many, who were his rivals in his lord&s;hip's e&s;teem: they remon&s;trated, that Sir William Davenant, being a poet, was, for that ve|ry rea&s;on, unqualified for a place of &s;o much tru&s;t, and which demanded one of a &s;olid, and le&s;s vo|latile turn of mind, than the &s;ons of Parna&s;&s;us ge|nerally are. In this complaint they paid but an indifferent compliment to the General him&s;elf, who was a poet, and had written, and publi&s;hed &s;everal plays. That Davenant behaved well in his mili|tary capacity is very probable, &s;ince, in the month of September, 1643, he received the honour of knighthood from the King, at the &s;iege of Glou|ce&s;ter, an acknowledgment of his bravery, and &s;ignal &s;ervices, which be&s;towed at a time when
<PB N="70" REF="73">
a &s;trict &s;crutiny was made concerning the merit of officers, puts it beyond doubt, that Davenant, in his martial character, was as de&s;erving as in his po|etical. During the&s;e &s;evere contentions, and not|with&s;tanding his public character, our author's mu&s;e &s;ometimes rai&s;ed her voice, in the compo&s;ition of &s;everal plays, of which we &s;hall give &s;ome account when we enumerate his dramatic performances. Hi&s;tory is &s;ilent as to the means which induced Davenant to quit the Northern army, but as &s;oon as the King's affairs &s;o far declined, as to afford no hopes of a revival, he judged it nece&s;&s;ary to retire into France, where he was extremely well received by the Queen, into who&s;e confidence he had the honour to be taken, and was intru&s;ted with the negotiation of matters of the highe&s;t importance, in the &s;ummer of the year 1646. Before this time Sir William had embraced the popi&s;h reli|gion, which circum&s;tance might &s;o far ingratiate him with the queen, as to tru&s;t him with the mo&s;t important concerns. Lord Clarendon, who had a particular e&s;teem for him, has given a full account of this affair, though not much to his advantage, but yet with all the tenderne&s;s due to Sir William's good intentions, and of that long and intimate ac|quaintance that had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them; which is the more worthy the reader's notice, as it has entirely e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of all tho&s;e, who have undertaken to write this gentleman's Me|moirs, though the mo&s;t remarkable pa&s;&s;age in his whole life.</P>
<P>The King, in retiring to the Scots, had follow|ed the advice of the French amba&s;&s;ador, who had promi&s;ed on their behalf, if not more than he had authority to do, at lea&s;t, more than they were in|clined to perform; to ju&s;tify, however, his conduct at home, he was inclined to throw the weight, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, upon the King, and with this view, he, by an expre&s;s, informed cardinal Mazarine,
<PB N="71" REF="74">
that his Maje&s;ty was too re&s;erved in giving the Par|liament &s;atisfaction, and therefore de&s;ired that &s;ome per&s;on might be &s;ent over, who had a &s;ufficient degree of credit with the Engli&s;h Monarch, to per&s;uade him to &s;uch compliances, as were ne|ce&s;&s;ary for his intere&s;t. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The Queen, &s;ays the noble hi&s;torian, who was never advi&s;ed by tho&s;e, who either under&s;tood, or valued her Hu&s;band's intere&s;t, con&s;ulted tho&s;e about her, and &s;ent Sir William Davenant, an hone&s;t man, and a witty, but in all re&s;pects unequal to &s;uch a tru&s;t, with a letter of credit to the King, who knew the per&s;on well enough under another character than was likely to give him much credit upon the argument, with which he was entru&s;ted, al|though the Queen had likewi&s;e otherwi&s;e declared her opinion to his Maje&s;ty, that he &s;hould part with the church for his peace and &s;ecurity.'</Q> Sir William had, by the countenance of the French amba&s;&s;ador, ea&s;y admi&s;&s;ion to the King, who heard patiently all he had to &s;ay, and an&s;wered him in in a manner, which demon&s;trated that he was not plea&s;ed with the advice. When he found his Ma|je&s;ty un&s;atisfied, and not di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ent to what was earne&s;tly de&s;ired by tho&s;e by whom he had been &s;ent, who undervalued all tho&s;e &s;cruples of con&s;cience, with which his Maje&s;ty was &s;o &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he took upon him&s;elf the liber|ty of offering &s;ome rea&s;ons to the king, to induce him to yield to what was propo&s;ed, and among other things &s;aid, it was the opinion and advice of all his friends; his Maje&s;ty asked, what friends? to which Davenant replied, lord Jermyn, and lord Cole|pepper; the King upon this ob&s;erved, that lord Jermyn did not under&s;tand any thing of the church, and that Colepepper was of no religion; but, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, what is the opinion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer? to which Davenant an&s;wered, he did not know, that he was not there, and had
<PB N="72" REF="75">
de&s;erted the Prince, and thereupon mentioned the Queen's di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Chancellor; to which the King &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The Chancellor was an hone&s;t man, and would never de&s;ert him nor the Prince, nor the Church; and that he was &s;orry he was not with his &s;on, but that his wife was mi&s;taken.'</Q></P>
<P>Davenant then offering &s;ome rea&s;ons of his own, in which he treated the church with in|dignity, his Maje&s;ty was &s;o tran&s;ported with an|ger, that he gave him a &s;harper rebuke than he u&s;ually gave to any other man, and forbad him again, ever to pre&s;ume to come into his pre&s;ence; upon which poor Davenant was deeply affected, and returned into France to give an account of his ill &s;ucce&s;s to tho&s;e who &s;ent him.</P>
<P>Upon Davenant's return to Paris, he a&s;&s;ociated with a &s;et of people, who endeavoured to alle|viate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of exile by &s;ome kind of a|mu&s;ement. The diver&s;ion, which Sir William cho&s;e was of the literary &s;ort, and having long indulg|ed an inclination of writing an heroic poem, and having there much lei&s;ure, and &s;ome encourage|ment, he was induced to undertake one of a new kind; the two fir&s;t books of which he fini&s;hed at the Louvre, where he lived with his old friend Lord Jermyn; and the&s;e with a preface, addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Hobbs, his an&s;wer, and &s;ome commenda|tory poems, were publi&s;hed in England; of which we &s;hall give &s;ome further account in our ani|madver&s;ions upon Gondibert.</P>
<P>While he employed him&s;elf in the &s;ervice of the mu&s;es, Henrietta Maria, the queen dowager of England who&s;e particular favour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">te he was found out bu&s;ine&s;s for him of another na|ture. She had heard that va&s;t improvements might be made in the loyal colony of Virginia, in ca&s;e proper artificers were &s;ent there; and there being many of the&s;e in France who were de&s;titute of
<PB N="73" REF="76">
employment, &s;he encouraged Sir William to col|lect the&s;e artificers together, who accordingly em|barked with his little colony at one of the ports in Normandy; but in this expedition he was like|wi&s;e unfortunate; for before the ve&s;&s;el was clear of the French coa&s;t, &s;he was met by one of the Parliament &s;hips of war, and carried into the i&s;le of Wight, where our di&s;appointed projector was &s;ent clo&s;e pri&s;oner to Cowes Ca&s;tle, and there had lei&s;ure enough, and what is more extraordinary, wanted not inclination to re&s;ume his heroic poem, and having written about half the third book, in a very gloomy pri&s;on, he thought proper to &s;top &s;hort again, finding him&s;elf, as he imagined under the very &s;hadow of death. Upon this occa&s;ion it is reported of Davenant, that he wrote a let|ter to Hobbes, in which he gives &s;ome account of the progre&s;s he made in the third book of Gondibert, and offers &s;ome critici&s;ms upon the nature of that kind of poetry; but why, &s;ays he, &s;hould I trouble you or my&s;elf, with the&s;e thoughts, when I am pretty certain I &s;hall be hanged next week. This gaiety of temper in Davenant, while he was in the mo&s;t deplorable circum&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s, carries &s;omething in it very &s;ingular, and perhaps could proceed from no other cau&s;e but con&s;cious innocence; for he appears to have been an inof|fen&s;ive good natured man. He was conveyed from the I&s;le of Wight to the Tower of London, and for &s;ome time his life was in the utmo&s;t ha|zard; nor is it quite certain by what means he was pre&s;erved from falling a &s;acrifice to the pre|vailing fury. Some conjecture that two aldermen of York, to whom he had been kind when they were pri&s;oners, interpo&s;ed their influence for him; others more rea&s;onably conjecture that Milton was his friend, and prevented the utmo&s;t effects of party rage from de&s;cending on the head of this &s;on of the mu&s;es. But by whatever means
<PB N="74" REF="77">
his life was &s;aved, we find him two years after a pri&s;oner of the Tower, where he obtained &s;ome indulgence by the favour of the Lord Keeper Whitlocke; upon receiving which he wrote him a letter of thanks, which as it &s;erves to illu&s;trate how ea&s;ily and politely he wrote in pro&s;e, we &s;hall here in&s;ert.

Our author was &s;o far happy as to obtain by this letter the favour of Whitlocke, who was, per|haps, a man of more humanity and gentlene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, than &s;ome other of the covenanters.

He was con&s;cious that a play-hou&s;e was entirely incon&s;i&s;tent with the gloomine&s;s, and &s;everity of the&s;e times; and yet he was certain that there were people of ta&s;te enough in town, to fill one, if &s;uch a &s;cheme could be managed; which he conducted with great addre&s;s, and at la&s;t brought to bear, as he had the countenance of lord Whitlocke, Sir John Maynard, and other per&s;ons of rank, who really were a&s;hamed of the cant and hypocri&s;y which then prevailed. In con&s;equence of this, our poet opened a kind of theatre at Rutland Hou&s;e, where &s;everal pieces were acted, and if they did not gain him reputa|tion, they procured him what is more &s;olid, and what he then more wanted, money. Some of the people in power, it &s;eems, were lovers of mu&s;ic, and tho' they did not care to own it, they were wi&s;e enough to know that there was nothing &s;candalous or immoral in the diver&s;ions of the theatre. Sir William therefore, when he applied for a permi&s;&s;ion called what he intended to repre&s;ent an opera; but when he brought it on the &s;tage, it appeared quite another thing, which when printed had the following title:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t day's entertainment at Rutland-Hou&s;e by declamation and mu&s;ic, after the manner of the ancients.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="79">
This being an introductory piece, it demanded all the author's wit to make it an&s;wer different intentions; for fir&s;t it was to be &s;o plea&s;ing as to gain applau&s;e; and next it was to be be &s;o remote from the very appearance of a play, as not to give any offence to that pretended &s;anc|tity that was then in fa&s;hion. It began with mu|&s;ic, then followed a prologue, in which the au|thor rallies the oddity of his own performance. The curtain being drawn up to the &s;ound of &s;low and &s;olemn mu&s;ic, there followed a grave declamation by one in a guilded ro&s;trum, who per&s;onated Diogenes, and &s;hewed the u&s;e and ex|cellency of dramatic entertainments. The &s;econd part of the entertainment con&s;i&s;ted of two lighter declamations; the fir&s;t by a citizen of Paris, who wittily rallies the follies of Lon|don; the other by a citizen of London, who takes the &s;ame liberty with Paris and its inha|bitants. To this was tacked a &s;ong, and after that came a &s;hort epilogue. The mu&s;ic was com|po&s;ed by Dr. Coleman, Capt. Cook, Mr. Henry Laws, and Mr. George Hud&s;on.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal other pieces which Sir Wil|liam introduced upon this &s;tage of the &s;ame kind, which met with as much &s;ucce&s;s, as could be expected from the nature of the performances them&s;elves, and the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the audience. Being thus introduced, he at la&s;t grew a little bolder, and not only ventured to write, but to act &s;everal new plays, which were al&s;o &s;omewhat in a new ta&s;te; that is, they were more regular in their &s;tructure, and the language gene|rally &s;peaking, &s;moother, and more correct than the old tragedies. The&s;e improvements were in a great mea&s;ure owing to Sir William's long re&s;i|dence in France, which gave him an opportunity of reading their be&s;t writers, and hearing the &s;entiments
<PB N="77" REF="80">
of their able&s;t critics upon dramatic entertainments, where they were as much admired and encouraged, as at that time de&s;pi&s;ed in England. That the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e were really improvements, and that the public &s;tood greatly indebted to Sir William Davenant as a poet, and ma&s;ter of a theatre, we can pro|duce no le&s;s an authority than that of Dryden, who, beyond any of his predece&s;&s;ors, contempo|raries, or tho&s;e who have &s;ucceeded him, under|&s;tood poetry as an art. In his e&s;&s;ay on heroic plays, he thus &s;peaks, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The fir&s;t light we had of them, on the Engli&s;h theatre (&s;ays he) was from Sir William Davenant. It being forbid|den him in the religious times to act trage|dies or comedies, becau&s;e they contained &s;ome matter of &s;candal to tho&s;e good people, who could more ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s their lawful &s;ove|reign, than endure a wanton je&s;t, he was for|ced to turn his thoughts another way, and to introduce the examples of moral virtue written in ver&s;e, and performed in recitative mu&s;ic. The original of this mu&s;ic, and of the &s;cenes which adorned his works, he had from the Italian opera's; but he heightened his charac|ters, as I may probably imagine, from the ex|amples of Corneille, and &s;ome French poets. In this condition did this part of poetry remain at his Maje&s;ty's return, when grown bolder as now owned by public authority, Davenant re|vived the Siege of Rhodes, and cau&s;ed it to be acted as a ju&s;t drama. But as few men have the happine&s;s to begin and fini&s;h any new project, &s;o neither did he live to make his de&s;ign perfect. There wanted the &s;ulne&s;s of a plot, and the variety of characters to form it as it ought; and perhaps &s;omewhat might have been added to the beauty of the &s;tile: all which he would have performed with more

exactne&s;s, had he plea&s;ed to have given us another work of the &s;ame nature. For my&s;elf and others who came after him, we are bound with all veneration to his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mory, to acknow|ledge what advantage we received from that excellent ground work, which is laid, and &s;ince it is an ea&s;y thing to add to what is already invented, we ought all of us, without envy to him, or partiality to our&s;elves, to yield him the precedence in it."</Q></P>
<P>Immediately after the re&s;toration there were two companies of players formed, one under the title of the King's Servants, the other, under that of the Duke's Company, both by patents from the crown; the fir&s;t granted to Henry Killigrew, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and the latter to Sir William Davenant. The King's company acted fir&s;t at the Red Bull in the upper end of St. John's Street, and after a year or two removing from place to place, they e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in Drury-Lane. It was &s;ome time before Sir William Davenant com|pleated his company, into which he took all who had formerly played under Mr. Rhodes in the Cock-Pit in Drury-Lane, and among&s;t the&s;e the famous Mr. Betterton, who appeared fir&s;t to advantage under the patronage of Sir William Davenant. He opened the Duke's theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields with his own dramatic per|formance of the Siege of Rhodes, the hou&s;e be|ing finely decorated, and the &s;tage &s;upplied with painted &s;cenes, which were by him introduced at lea&s;t, if not invented, which afforded certainly an additional beauty to the theatre, tho' &s;ome have in&s;inuated, that fine &s;cenes proved the ruin of acting; but as we are per&s;uaded it will be an entertaining circum&s;tance to our Readers, to have that matter more fully explained, we &s;hall take this opportunity of doing it.</P>

In the reign of Charles I. dramatic entertain|ments were accompanied with rich &s;cenery, curious machines, and other elegant embelli&s;hments, chiefly conducted by the wonderful dexterity of that ce|lebrated Engli&s;h architect Inigo Jones. But the&s;e were employed only in ma&s;ques at court, and were too expen&s;ive for the little theatres in which plays were then acted. In them there was no|thing more than a curtain of very coar&s;e &s;tuff, upon the drawing up of which, the &s;tage appeared either with bare walls on the &s;ides, coar&s;ly mat|ted, or covered with tape&s;try; &s;o that for the place originally repre&s;ented, and all the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive changes in which the poets of tho&s;e times freely indulged them&s;elves, there was nothing to help the &s;pectator's under&s;tanding, or to a&s;&s;i&s;t the actor's performance, but bare imagination. In Shake&s;pear's time &s;o undecorated were the thea|tres, that a blanket &s;upplied the place of a cur|tain; and it was a good ob&s;ervation of the in+genious Mr. Chitty, a gentleman of acknowledged ta&s;te in dramatic excellence, that the circum|&s;tance of the blanket, &s;ugge&s;ted to Shake&s;pear that noble image in Macbeth, where the mur|derer invokes<Q><L>Thick night to veil it&s;elf in the dunne&s;t &s;moke of Hell,</L>
<L>Nor Heaven peep thro' the blanket of the dark</L>
<L>To cry hold, hold.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is true, that while things continued in this &s;ituation, there were a great many play-hou&s;es, &s;ometimes &s;ix or &s;even open at once. Of the&s;e &s;ome were large, and in part open, where they acted by-day light; others &s;maller, but better fitted up, where they made u&s;e of candles. The plainne&s;s of the theatre made the prices &s;mall,
<PB N="80" REF="83">
and drew abundance of c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">pany; yet upon the whole it is doubtful, whether the &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ctators in all the&s;e hou&s;es were really &s;uperior in number, to tho&s;e who have frequented the theatres in later times. If the &s;pirit and judgment of the actors &s;upplied all deficiencies, and made as &s;ome would in&s;inuate, plays more intelligible without &s;cenes, than they afterwards were with them, it mu&s;t be very a&s;toni&s;hing; neither is it difficult to a&s;&s;ign a|nother cau&s;e, why tho&s;e who were concerned in play-hou&s;es, were angry at the introduction of &s;eenes and decorations, which was, that notwith|&s;tanding the advanced prices, their profits from that time were continually &s;inking; and an au|ther. of high authority in this ca&s;e, a&s;|&s;ures us, in an hi&s;torical account of the &s;tage, that the whole &s;hare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s in Mr. Hart's company divided a thou&s;and pounds a year a-piece, before the expen&s;ive decorations became fa&s;hionable. Sir. William Davenant con&s;ider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d things in ano|ther light: he was well acquainted with the alte|rations which the French theatre had received, under the au&s;pice of cardinal Richlieu, who had an excellent ta&s;te; and he remembered the noble contrivances of Inigo Jones, which were not at all inferior to the de&s;igns of the be&s;t French ma&s;ters. Sir William was likewi&s;e &s;en&s;ible that the monarch he &s;erved was an excellent judge of every thing of this kind; and the&s;e con&s;iderations excited in him a pa&s;&s;ion for the advancement of the theatre, to which the great figure it has &s;ince made is chiefly owing. Mr. Dryden has ac|knowledged his admirable talents in this way, and gratefully remembers the pains taken by our poet, to &s;et a work of his in the faire&s;t light po&s;|&s;ible, and to which, he ingenuou&s;ly a&s;cribes the &s;ucce&s;s with which it was received. This is the hi&s;tory of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of &s;cenery on
<PB N="81" REF="84">
our &s;tage; which, without doubt, gives greater life to the entertainment of a play; but as the be&s;t purpo&s;es may be pro&s;tituted, &s;o there is &s;ome rea&s;on to believe that the exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s for decorations, which now prevails, has hurt the true dramatic ta&s;te. Scenes are to be con&s;idered as &s;econdary in a play, the means of &s;etting it off with lu&s;tre, and ought to engro&s;s but little at|tention; as it is more important to hear what a character &s;peaks, than to ob&s;erve the place where he &s;tands; but now the ca&s;e is altered. The &s;cenes in a Harlequin Sorcerer, and other unmean|ing pantomimes, unknown to our more elegant and judging fore-fathers, procure crowded hou&s;es, while the noble&s;t &s;trokes of Dryden, the delicate touches of Otway and Rowe, the wild maje&s;ty of Shake&s;pear, and the heart-felt language of Lee, pa&s;s neglected, when put in competition with tho&s;e gewgaws of the &s;tage, the&s;e fea&s;ts of the eye; which as they can communicate no ideas, &s;o they can neither warm nor reform the heart, nor an&s;wer one moral purpo&s;e in nature.</P>
<P>We ought not to omit a circum&s;tance much in favour of Sir William Davenant, which proves him to have been as good a man as a poet. When at the Re&s;toration, tho&s;e who had been ac|tive in di&s;turbing the late reign, and &s;ecluding their &s;overeign from the throne, became obnoxious to the royal party, Milton was likely to feel the vengeance of the court, Davenant actuated by a noble principle of gratitude, interpo&s;ed all his influence, and &s;aved the greate&s;t ornament of the world from the &s;troke of an executioner. Ten years before that, Davenant had been re&s;cued by Milton, and he remembered the favour; an in|&s;tance, this, that genero&s;ity, gratitude, and noble|ne&s;s of nature is confined to no particular party; but the heart of a good man will &s;till di&s;cover it&s;elf in acts of munificence and kindne&s;s, how|ever
<PB N="82" REF="85">
mi&s;taken he may be in his opinion, howe|ver warm in &s;tate factions. The particulars of this extraordinary affair are related in the life of Milton.</P>
<P>Sir William Davenant continued at the head of his company of actors, and at la&s;t transferred them to a new and magnificent theatre built in Dor&s;et-Gardens, where &s;ome of his old plays were revived with very &s;ingular circum&s;tances of royal kindne&s;s, and a new one when brought upon the &s;tage met with great applau&s;e.</P>
<P>The la&s;t labour of his pen was in altering a play of Shake&s;pear's, called the Tempe&s;t, &s;o as to render it agreeable to that age, or rather &s;u&s;|ceptible of tho&s;e theatrical improvements he had brought into fa&s;hion. The great &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his laurel, in a preface to this play, in which he was concerned with Davenant, <Q>'&s;ays, that he was a man of quick and piercing imagination, and &s;oon found that &s;omewhat might be added to the de&s;ign of Shake&s;pear, of which neither Fletcher nor Suckling had ever thought; and therefore to put the la&s;t hand to it, he de&s;ign|ed the counterpart to Shake&s;pear's plot, namely, that of a man who had never &s;een a woman, that by this means, the&s;e two characters of innocence and love might the more illu&s;trate and commend each other. This excellent con|trivance he was plea&s;ed to communicate to me, and to de&s;ire my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in it. I con|fe&s;s that from the fir&s;t moment it &s;o plea&s;ed me, that I never wrote any thing with &s;o much delight. I might likewi&s;e do him that ju&s;tice, to acknowledge that my writing received daily amendments, and that is the rea&s;on why it is not &s;o &s;aulty, as the re&s;t that I have done, without the help or correction of &s;o judicious a friend.

<P>This great man died at his hou&s;e in little Lin|coln's-Inn-Fields, April 17, 1668, aged 63, and two days afterwards was interred in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey. On his grave&s;tone is in&s;cribed, in imita|tion of Ben John&s;on's &s;hort epitaph,<Q>O RARE SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT!</Q></P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that his remains re&s;t very near the place out of which tho&s;e of Mr. Thomas May, who had been formerly his rival for the bays, and the Parliament's hi&s;torian, were removed, by order of the mini&s;try. As to the family our author left behind him, &s;ome ac|count of it will be given in the life of his &s;on Dr. Charles Davenant, who &s;ucceeded him as manager of the theatre. Sir William's works en|tire were publi&s;hed by his widow 1673, and de|dicated to James Duke of York.</P>
<P>After many &s;torms of adver&s;ity, our author &s;pent the evening of his days in ea&s;e and &s;ere|nity. He had the happine&s;s of being loved by people of all denominations, and died lamented by every worthy good man. As a poet, unnum|bered evidences may be produced in his favour. Among&s;t the&s;e Mr. Dryden is the foremo&s;t, for when his te&s;timony can be given in &s;upport of poetical merit, we reckon all other evidence &s;uperfluous, and without his, all other evidences deficient. In his words then we &s;hall &s;um up Davenant's character as a poet, and a man of genius. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'I found him, (&s;ays he) in his preface to the Tempe&s;t, of &s;o quick a fancy, that nothing was propo&s;ed to him on which he could not quick|ly produce a thought extreamly plea&s;ant and &s;urprizing, and the&s;e fir&s;t thoughts of his, con|trary

to the old Latin proverb, were not always the lea&s;t happy, and as his fancy was quick, &s;o likewi&s;e were the products of it remote and new. He borrowed not of any other, and his imaginations were &s;uch as could not ea&s;ily en|ter into any other man. His corrections were &s;ober and judicious, and he corrected his own writings much more &s;everely than tho&s;e of ano|ther man, be&s;towing twice the labour and pain in poli&s;hing which he u&s;ed in invention.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Before we enumerate the dramatic works of Sir William Davenant, it will be but ju&s;tice to his merit, to in&s;ert &s;ome animadver&s;ions on his Gondibert; a poem which has been the &s;ubject of controver&s;y almo&s;t a hundred years; that is, from its fir&s;t appearance to the pre&s;ent time. Perhaps the di&s;pute had been long ago decided, if the author's lei&s;ure had permitted him to fini&s;h it. At pre&s;ent we &s;ee it to great di&s;advantage; and if notwith&s;tanding this it has any beauties, we may fairly conclude it would have come much nearer perfection, if the &s;tory, begun with &s;o much &s;pi|rit, had been brought to an end upon the au|thor's plan.</P>
<P>Mr. Hobbes, the famous philo&s;opher of Malm&s;|bury, in a letter printed in his works, affirms, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that he never yet &s;aw a poem that had &s;o much &s;hape of art, health of morality and vigour, and beauty of expre&s;&s;ion, as this of our au|thor; and in an epi&s;tle to the honourable Ed|ward Howard, author of the Briti&s;h Princes, he thus &s;peaks. My judgment in poetry has been once already cen&s;ured by very good wits for commending Gondibert; but yet have they not di&s;abled my te&s;timony. For what authority is there in wit? a je&s;ter may have it; a man in drink may have it, and be fluent over night, and wi&s;e and dry in the morning: What is it? and who can tell whether it be better to have
<PB N="85" REF="88">
it or no? I will take the liberty to prai&s;e what I like as well as they, and reprehend what they like.'</Q>&mdash;Mr. Rymer in his preface to his tran&s;lation of Rapin's Reflexions on Ari&s;to|totle's Treati&s;e of Poetry, ob&s;erves, that our au|thor's wit is well known, and in the preface to that poem, there appears &s;ome &s;trokes of an extraordinary judgment; that he is for unbeat|en tracts, and new ways of thinking, but cer|tainly in the untried &s;eas he is no great di&s;co|verer. One de&s;ign of the Epic poets before him was to adorn their own country, there finding their heroes and patterns of virtue, where exam|ple, as they thought, would have the greater in|fluence and power over po&s;terity; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">"but this poet, &s;ays Rymer, &s;teers a different cour&s;e; his he|roes are all foreigners; he cultivates a country that is nothing a-kin to him, and Lombardy reaps the honour of all. Other poets cho&s;e &s;ome action or hero &s;o illu&s;trious, that the name of the poem prepared the reader, and made way for its reception; but in this poem none can divine what great action he intended to celebrate, nor is the reader obliged to know whether the hero be Turk or Chri&s;tian; nor do the fir&s;t lines give any light or pro&s;pect in|to the de&s;ign. Altho' a poet &s;hould know all arts and &s;ciences, yet ought he di&s;creetly to manage his knowledge. He mu&s;t have a judg|ment to &s;elect what is noble and beautiful, and proper for the occa&s;ion. He mu&s;t by a parti|cular chemi&s;try, extract the e&s;&s;ence of things; without &s;oiling his wit with dro&s;s or trumpery. The &s;ort of ver&s;e Davenant makes choice of in his Gondibert might contribute much to the vitiating his &s;tile; for thereby he obliges him|&s;elf to &s;tretch every period to the end of four lines: Thus the &s;en&s;e is broken perpetually with parenthe&s;es, the words jumbled in confu&s;ion,
<PB N="86" REF="89">
and darkne&s;s &s;pread over all; but it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that Davenant had a particular talent for the manners; his thoughts are great, and there appears &s;omething roughly noble thro' the whole."</Q> This is the &s;ub&s;tance of Rymer's ob&s;ervations on Gondibert. Rymer was certainly a &s;cholar, and a man of di&s;cernment; and tho in &s;ome parts of the critici&s;ms he is undoubtedly right, yet in other parts he is demon&s;trably wrong. He complains that Davenant has la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d the &s;cene of action in Lombardy, which Rymer calls ne|glecting his own country; but the critic &s;hould have con&s;idered, that however well it might have plea&s;ed the poet's countrymen, yet as an epic poem is &s;uppo&s;ed to be read in every nation en|lightened by &s;cience, there can no objections a|ri&s;e from that quarter by any but tho&s;e who were of the &s;ame country with the author. His not making choice of a pompous name, and intro|ducing his poem with an exordium, is rather a beauty than a fault; for by the&s;e means he leaves room for &s;urprize, which is the fir&s;t excellency in any poem, and to &s;trike out beauties where they are not expected, has a happy influence upon the reader. Who would think from Milton's in|troduction, that &s;o &s;tupendous a work would en|&s;ue, and &s;imple dignity is certainly more noble, than all the efforts and colourings which art and labour can be&s;tow.</P>
<P>The ingenious and learned Mr. Blackwall, Pro|fe&s;&s;or of Greek in the univer&s;ity of Aberdeen, in his enquiry into the life and writings of Homer, cen&s;ures the &s;tructure of the poem; but at the &s;ame time pays a compliment to the abilities of the author. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was indeed (&s;ays he) a very ex|traordinary project of our ingenious country|man, to write an epie poem without mixing alle|gory, or allowing the &s;malle&s;t fiction throughout the compo&s;ure. It was like lopping off a man's
<PB N="87" REF="90">
limb, and then putting him upon running races; tho' it mu&s;t be owned that the performance &s;hews, with what ability he could have acquitted him|&s;elf, had he been found and entire."</Q></P>
<P>Such the animadver&s;ions which critics of great name have made on Gondibert, and the re&s;ult is, that if Davenant had not power to begin and con&s;ummate an epic poem, yet by what he has done, he has a right to rank in the fir&s;t cla&s;s of poets, e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered that we owe to him the great perfection of the theatre, and putting it upon a level with that of France and Italy; and as the theatrical are the mo&s;t rational of all amu&s;ements, the late&s;t po&s;terity &s;hould hold his name in veneration, who did &s;o much for the advancement of innocent plea|&s;ures, and blending in&s;truction and gaiety toge|ther.</P>

<HEAD>HENRY KING, Bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter,</HEAD>
<P>THE elde&s;t &s;on of Dr. John King lord bi|&s;hop of London, whom Win&s;tanley calls a per&s;on well fraught with epi&s;copal qualities, was born at Wornal in Bucks, in the month of Ja|nuary 1591. He was educated partly in gram|mar learning in the free &s;chool at Thame in Oxford&s;hire, and partly in the College &s;chool at We&s;tmin&s;ter, from which la&s;t he was elected a &s;tudent in Chri&s;t Church 1608, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Athen, Oxon, vol. ii. p. 431. 1721 Ed.</NOTE> being then un|der the tuition of a noted tutor. Afterwards he took the degrees in arts, and entered into holy orders, and &s;oon became a florid preacher, and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively chaplain to King James I. archdeacon of Colche&s;ter, re&s;identiary of St. Paul's cathedral, canon and dean of Roche&s;ter, in which dignity he was in&s;talled the 6th of February 1638. In 1641, &s;ays Mr. Wood, he was made bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, being one of tho&s;e per&s;ons of unble|mi&s;hed reputation, that his Maje&s;ty, tho' late, promoted to that honourable office; which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed without any removal, &s;ave that by the members of the Long Parliament, to the time of his death.</P>
<P>When he was young he delighted much in the &s;tudy of mu&s;ic and poetry, which with his wit and fancy made his conver&s;ation very agreeable, and when he was more advanced in years he ap|plied him&s;elf to oratory, philo&s;ophy, and divinity, in which he became eminent.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="94">
It happened that this bi&s;hop attending divine &s;ervice in a church at Langley in Bucks, and hearing there a p&s;alm &s;ung, who&s;e wretched ex|pre&s;&s;ion, far from conveying the meaning of the Royal P&s;almi&s;t, not only marred devotion, but turned what was excellent in the original into downright burle&s;que; he tried that evening if he could not ea&s;ily, and with plainne&s;s &s;uitable to the lowe&s;t under&s;tanding, deliver it from that garb which rendered it ridiculous. He fini&s;hed one p&s;alm, and then another, and found the work &s;o agreeable and plea&s;ing, that all the p&s;alms were in a &s;hort time compleated; and having &s;hewn the ver&s;ion to &s;ome friends of who&s;e judg|ment he had a high opinion, he could not re&s;i&s;t their importunity (&s;ays Wood) of putting it to the pre&s;s, or rather he was glad their &s;ollicitati|ons coincided with his de&s;ire to be thought a poet.</P>
<P>He was the more di&s;couraged, &s;ays the anti|quary, as Mr. George Sandys's ver&s;ion and ano|ther by a reformer had failed in two different extremes; the fir&s;t too elegant for the vulgar u&s;e, changing both metre and tunes, wherewith they had been long acquainted; the other as flat and poor, and as lamely executed as the old one, He therefore ventured in a middle way, as he him&s;elf in one of his letters expre&s;&s;es it, without affectation of words, and endeavouring to leave them not disfigured in the &s;en&s;e. This ver&s;ion &s;oon after was publi&s;hed with this title;</P>
<P>The P&s;alms of David from the New Tran&s;lation of the Bible, turned into Metre, to be &s;ung after the old tunes u&s;ed in churches, Lond. 1651, in 12mo.</P>
<P>There is nothing more ridiculous than this notion of the vulgar of not parting with their
<PB N="92" REF="95">
old ver&s;ions of the p&s;alms, as if there were a merit in &s;inging hymns of non&s;en&s;e. Tate and Brady's ver&s;ion is by far the mo&s;t elegant, and be&s;t calculated to in&s;pire devotion, becau&s;e the language and poetry are &s;ometimes elevated and &s;ublime; and yet for one church which u&s;es this ver&s;ion, twenty are content with that of Sternhold and Hopkins, the language and poetry of which, as Pope &s;ays of Ogilvy's Virgil, are beneath critici&s;m.&mdash;</P>
<P>After epi&s;copacy was &s;ilenced by the Long Par|liament, he re&s;ided in the hou&s;e of Sir Richard Hobbart (who had married his &s;i&s;ter) at Langley in Bucks. He was rein&s;tated in his See by King Charles II. and was much e&s;teemed by the vir|tuous part of his neighbours, and had the ble&s;|&s;ings of the poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, a character which reflects the highe&s;t honour upon him.</P>
<P>Whether from a de&s;ire of extending his bene|ficence, or in&s;tigated by the re&s;tle&s;s ambition pe|culiar to the prie&s;thood, he &s;ollicited, but in vain, a higher preferment, and &s;uffered his re&s;entment to betray him into mea&s;ures not con&s;i&s;tent with his epi&s;copal character. He died on the fir&s;t day of October 1669<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wood Athen. Oxon. P. 432, vol. 2.</NOTE>, and was buried on the &s;outh &s;ide of the choir, near the communion table, be|longing to the cathedral church in Chiche&s;ter.

As to Mu&s;aeus, he had &s;o great a value for him, that after he had tran&s;lated him, he reduced the &s;tory into a dramatic poem, called Hero and Leander, a Tragedy, printed in 4to. 1669, and addre&s;&s;ed to the Duche&s;s of Mon|mouth.

<HEAD>Dr. JASPER MAIN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS poet was born at Hatherleigh, in the reign of King James I. He was a man of reputation, as well for his natural parts, as his acquired accompli&s;hments. He received his education at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, where he conti|nued 'till he was removed to Chri&s;t Church, Oxon, and in the year 1624 admitted &s;tudent. He made &s;ome figure at the univer&s;ity, in the &s;tudy of arts and &s;ciences, and was &s;ollicited by men of emi|nence, who e&s;teemed him for his abilities, to en|ter into holy orders; this he was not long in com|plying with, and was preferred to two livings, both in the gift of the College, one of which was hap|pily &s;ituated near Oxford.</P>

Soon after he was created doctor of divinity, and re&s;ided at Oxford, till the time of the mock vi&s;itation, &s;ent to the univer&s;ity, when, among&s;t a great many others, equally di&s;tingui&s;hed for their loyalty and zeal for that unfortunate Mo|narch, he was ejected from the college, and &s;tript of both his livings. During the rage of the civil war, he was patronized by the earl of Devon&s;hire, at who&s;e hou&s;e he re&s;ided till the re&s;toration of Charles II. when he was not only put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of his former places, but made canon of Chri&s;t's Church, and arch-deacon of Chiche&s;ter, which preferments he enjoyed till his death. He was an orthodox preacher, a man of &s;evere virtue, a rea|dy and facetious wit. In his younger years he ad|dicted him&s;elf to poetry, and produced two plays, which were held in &s;ome e&s;teem in his own time; but as they have never been revived, nor taken notice of by any of our critics, in all probability they are but &s;econd rate performances.<LIST>

<HEAD>JOHN MILTON.</HEAD>
<P>THE Briti&s;h nation, which has produced the greate&s;t men in every profe&s;&s;ion, before the appearance of Milton could not enter into any com|petition with antiquity, with regard to the &s;ublime ex|cellencies of poetry. Greece could boa&s;t an Euripides, E&s;chylus, Sophocles and Sappho; England was proud of her Shake&s;pear, Spen&s;er, John&s;on and Fletcher; but then the ancients had &s;till a poet in re|&s;erve &s;uperior to the re&s;t, who &s;tood unrivalled by all &s;ucceeding times, and in epic poetry, which is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the highe&s;t effort of genius, Ho|mer had no rival. When Milton appeared, the pride of Greece was humbled, the competition became more equal, and &s;ince Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t is ours; it would, perhaps, be an injury to our national fame to yield the palm to any &s;tate, whether an|cient or modern.</P>
<P>The author of this a&s;toni&s;hing work had &s;ome|thing very &s;ingular in his life, as if he had been marked out by Heaven to be the wonder of every age, in all points of view in which he can be con|&s;idered. He lived in the times of general confu&s;i|on; he was engaged in the factions of &s;tate, and the cau&s;e he thought proper to e&s;pou&s;e, he main|tained
<PB N="109" REF="114">
with un&s;haken firmne&s;s; he &s;truggled to the la&s;t for what he was per&s;uaded were the rights of humanity; he had a pa&s;&s;ion for civil liberty, and he embarked in the &s;upport of it, heedle&s;s of every con&s;ideration of danger; he expo&s;ed his fortune to the vici&s;&s;itudes of party contention, and he exerted his genius in writing for the cau&s;e he favoured.</P>
<P>There is no life, to which it is more difficult to do ju&s;tice, and at the &s;ame time avoid giving of|fence, than Milton's, there are &s;ome who have con&s;idered him as a regicide, others have extolled him as a patriot, and a friend to mankind: Party|rage &s;eldom knows any bounds, and differing fac|tions have prai&s;ed or blamed him, according to their principles of religion, and political opini|ons.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this life, a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate regard to truth, and an inviolable candour &s;hall be ob|&s;erved. Milton was not without a &s;hare of tho&s;e failings which are in&s;eparable from human nature; tho&s;e errors &s;ometimes expo&s;ed him to cen&s;ure, and they ought not to pa&s;s unnoticed; on the other hand, the apparent &s;incerity of his intentions, and the amazing force of his genius, naturally produce an extream tenderne&s;s for the faults with which his life is chequered: and as in any man's conduct fewer errors are &s;eldom found, &s;o no man's parts ever gave him a greater right to indulgence.</P>
<P>The author of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t was de&s;cended of an ancient family of that name at Milton, near Abingdon in Oxford&s;hire. He was the &s;on of John Milton a money-&s;crivener, and born the 9th of De|cember, 1608. The family from which he de&s;cend|ed had been long &s;eated there, as appears by the monuments &s;till to be &s;een in the church of Milton, 'till one of them, having taken the unfortunate &s;ide in the conte&s;ts between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter, was deprived of all his e&s;tate, except

Milton was both ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cated under a dome&s;tic tutor, and likewi&s;e at St. Paul's &s;chool under Mr. Alex|ander Gill, where he made, by his indefatigable application, an extraordinary progre&s;s in learning. From his 12th year he generally &s;at up all night at his &s;tudies, which, accompanied with frequent head-aches, proved very prejudicial to his eyes. In the year 1625 he was entered into Chri&s;t's College in Cambridge, under the tuition of Mr. William Chappel, afterwards bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s in Ireland, and even before that time, had di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf by &s;everal Latin and Engli&s;h poems<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Critical Account of Milton's Life and Writings.</NOTE>. Af|ter he had taken the degree of ma&s;ter of arts, in 1632 he left the univer&s;ity, and for the &s;pace of five years lived with his parents at their hou&s;e at Horton, near Colebrook in Buckingham&s;hire, where his father having acquired a competent fortune, thought proper to retire, and &s;pend the remainder of his days. In the year 1634 he wrote his Ma&s;que of Comus, performed at Ludlow Ca&s;tle, before John, earl of Bridgwater, then pre&s;ident of Wales: It appears from the edition of this Ma&s;que, publi&s;hed by Mr. Henry Lawes, that the principal performers were, the Lord Barclay, Mr. Thomas Egerton, the Lady Alice Egerton, and Mr. Lawes him&s;elf, who repre&s;ented an at|tendant &s;pirit.</P>

<P>In 1637 our author publi&s;hed his Lycidas; in this poem he laments the death of his friend Mr. Edward King, who was drowned in his pa&s;&s;age from Che&s;ter on the Iri&s;h &s;eas in 1637; it was printed the year following at Cambridge in 4to. in a collection of Latin and Engli&s;h poems upon Mr. King's death, with whom he had contracted the &s;tronge&s;t friend&s;hip. The Latin epitaph in|forms us, that Mr. King was &s;on of Sir John King, &s;ecretary for Ireland to Queen Elizabeth, James I. and Charles I. and that he was fellow in Chri&s;t's-College Cambridge, and was drowned in the twenty-fifth year of his age. But this poem of Lycidas does not altogether con&s;i&s;t in elegiac &s;trains of tenderne&s;s; there is in it a mixture of &s;atire and &s;evere indignation; for in part of it he takes occa&s;ion to rally the corruptions of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy, of whom he was no favourer; and fir&s;t di&s;covers his acrimony again&s;t archbi&s;hop Laud; he threatens him with the lo&s;s of his head, a fate which he afterwards met, thro' the fury of his enemies; at lea&s;t, &s;ays Dr. Newton, I can think of no &s;en&s;e &s;o proper to be given to the following ver&s;es in Lycidas;<Q><PB N="112" REF="117"><L>Be&s;ides what the grim wolf, with privy paw,</L>

<P>Upon the death of his mother, Milton obtained leave of his father to travel, and having waited upon Sir Henry Wotton, formerly amba&s;&s;ador at Venice, and then provo&s;t of Eaton-College, to whom he communicated his de&s;ign, that gentleman wrote a letter to him, dated from the College, April 18, 1638, and printed among the Reliquiae Wottonianae, and in Dr. Newton's life of Milton. Immediat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly after the receipt of this letter our author &s;et out for France, accompanied only with one man, who attended him thro' all his travels. At Paris Milton was introduced to the famous Hugo Grotius, and thence went to Florence, Siena, Rome and Naples, in all which places he was entertained with the utmo&s;t civility by per|&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>When our author was at Naples he was in|troduced to the acquaintance of Giovanni Bap|ti&s;ta Man&s;o, Marquis of Villa, a Neapolitan no|bleman, celebrated for his ta&s;te in the liberal arts, to whom Ta&s;&s;o addre&s;&s;es his dialogue on friend&s;hip, and whom he likewi&s;e mentions in his Gieru&s;alemme liberata, with great honour. This nobleman &s;hewed extraordinary civilities to Mil|ton, frequently vi&s;ited him at his lodgings, and accompanied him when he went to &s;ee the &s;eve|ral curio&s;ities of the city. He was not content with giving our author the&s;e exterior marks of re&s;pect only, but he honoured him by a Latin di&s;tich in his prai&s;e, which is printed before Milton's Latin poems. Milton no doubt was highly plea&s;ed with &s;uch extreme conde&s;cen&s;ion and e&s;teem from a per&s;on of the Marquis of
<PB N="113" REF="118">
Villa's quality; and as an evidence of his gra|titude, he pre&s;ented the Marquis at his depart|ure from Naples, his eclogue, entitled Man&s;us; which, &s;ays Dr. Newton, is well worth reading among his Latin poems; &s;o that it may be rec|koned a peculiar felicity in the Marquis of Villa's life to have been celebrated both by Ta&s;&s;o and Milton, the greate&s;t poets of their nation. Hav|ing &s;een the fine&s;t parts of Italy, and conver&s;ed with men of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, he was preparing to pa&s;s over into Sicily and Greece, when the news from England, that a civil war was like to lay his country in blood, diverted his purpo&s;e; for as by his education and principles he was attached to the parliamentary intere&s;t, he though it a mark of abject cowardice, for a lover of his country to take his plea&s;ure abroad, while the friends of liberty were contending at home for the rights of human nature. He re&s;olved there|fore to return by way of Rome, tho' he was di&s;|&s;uaded from pur&s;uing that re&s;olution by the mer|chants, who were informed by their corre&s;pond|ents, that the Engli&s;h je&s;uits there were forming plots again&s;t his life, in ca&s;e he &s;hould return thither, on account of the great freedom with which he had treated their religion, and the bold|ne&s;s he di&s;covered in demon&s;trating the ab&s;urdity of the Popi&s;h tenets; for he by no means ob|&s;erved the rule recommended to him by Sir Henry Wotton, of keeping his thoughts clo&s;e, and his countenance open. Milton was removed above di&s;&s;imulation, he hated whatever had the appear|ance of di&s;gui&s;e, and being naturally a man of undaunted courage, he was never afraid to a&s;&s;ert his opinions, nor to vindicate truth tho' violated by the &s;uffrage of the majority.</P>
<P>Stedfa&s;t in his re&s;olutions, he went to Rome a &s;econd time, and &s;tayed there two months more, neither concealing his name, nor declining any

di&s;putations to which his antagoni&s;ts in religious opinions invited him; he e&s;caped the &s;ecret ma|chinations of the je&s;uits, and came &s;afe to Flo|rence, where he was received by his friends with as much tenderne&s;s as if he had returned to his own country. Here he remained two months, as he had done in his former vi&s;it. excepting only an excur&s;ion of a few days to Lucca, and then cro&s;&s;ing the Appenine, and pa&s;&s;ing thro' Bologna, and Ferrara, he arrived at Venice, in which city he &s;pent a month; and having &s;hipped off the books he had collected in his travels, he took his cour&s;e thro' Verona, Milan, and along the Lake Leman to Geneva. In this city he conti|nued &s;ome time, meeting there with people of his own principles, and contracted an intimate friend|&s;hip with Giovanni Deodati, the mo&s;t learned profe&s;&s;or of Divinity, who&s;e annotations on the bible are publi&s;hed in Engli&s;h; and from thence returning to France the &s;ame way that he had gone before, he arrived &s;afe in England after an ab&s;ence of fifteen months, in which Milton had &s;een much of the world, read the characters of famous men, examined the policy of different countries, and made more exten&s;ive improvements than travellers of an inferior genius, and le&s;s pe|netration, can be &s;uppo&s;ed to do in double the time. Soon after his return he took a hand&s;ome hou&s;e in Alder&s;gate-&s;treet, and undertook the edu|cation of his &s;i&s;ter's two &s;ons, upon a plan of his own. In this kind of &s;chola&s;tic &s;olitude he continued &s;ome time, but he was not &s;o much immer&s;ed in academical &s;tudies, as to &s;tand an indifferent &s;pectator of what was acted upon the public theatre of his country. The nation was in great ferment in 1641, and the clamour a|gain&s;t epi&s;copacy running very high, Milton who di&s;covered how much inferior in eloquence and learning the puritan teachers were to the bi&s;hops,

engaged warmly with the former in &s;upport of the common cau&s;e, and exerci&s;ed all the power of which he was capable, in endeavouring to over|throw the prelatical e&s;tabli&s;hment, and accord|ingly publi&s;hed five tracts relating to church go|vernment; they were all printed at London in 4to. The fir&s;t was intitled, Reformation touching Church Di&s;cipline in England, and the Cau&s;es that have hitherto hindered it: two books written to a friend. The &s;econd was of Pre|latical Epi&s;copacy, and whether it may be dedu|ced from Apo&s;tolical Times, by virtue of tho&s;e Te&s;timonies which are alledged to that purpo&s;e in &s;ome late treati&s;es; one whereof goes under the name of James U&s;her archbi&s;hop of Armagh. The third was the Rea&s;on of Church Govern|ment urged again&s;t the Prelacy, by Mr. John Milton, in two books. The fourth was Animad|ver&s;ions upon the Remon&s;trants Defence again&s;t Smectymnuus; and the fifth an Apology for a Pamphlet called, a Mode&s;t Confutation of the Animadver&s;ions upon the Remon&s;trants again&s;t Smectymnuus; or as the title page is in &s;ome copies, an Apology for Smectymnuus, with the Rea&s;on of Church Government, by John Milton.</P>
<P>In the year 1643 Milton married the daugh|ter of Richard Powel, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Forre&s;t-hill in Oxford&s;hire; who not long after obtaining leave of her hu&s;band to pay a vi&s;it to her father in the country, but, upon repeated me&s;&s;ages to her, refu&s;ing to return, Milton &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to marry another, and in 1644 publi&s;hed the Doc|trine and Di&s;cipline of Divorce; the Judgment of Martin Bucer concerning Divorce, and the year following his Tetrachordon and Cola&s;terion. Mr. Philips ob&s;erves, and would have his readers believe, that the rea&s;on of his wife's aver&s;ion to return to him was the contrariety of their &s;tate principles. The lady being educated in loyal no|tions,
<PB N="116" REF="121">
po&s;&s;ibly imagined, that if ever the regal power &s;hould flouri&s;h again, her being connected with a per&s;on &s;o obnoxious to the King, would hurt her father's intere&s;t; this Mr. Philips alledges, but, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his authority, I di&s;&s;ent from his opinion. Had &s;he been afraid of mar|rying a man of Milton's principles, the rea&s;on was equally &s;trong before as after marriage, and her father mu&s;t have &s;een it in that light; but the true rea&s;on, or at lea&s;t a more rational one, &s;eems to be, that &s;he had no great affection for Milton's per&s;on.</P>
<P>Milton was a &s;tern man, and as he was &s;o much devoted to &s;tudy, he was perhaps too ne|gligent in tho&s;e endearments and tender intercour|&s;es of love which a wife has a right to expect. No lady ever yet was fond of a &s;cholar, who could not join the lover with it; and he who expects to &s;ecure the affections of his wife by the force of his under&s;tanding only, will find him|&s;elf mi&s;erably mi&s;taken: indeed it is no wonder that women who are formed for tenderne&s;s, and who&s;e highe&s;t excellence is delicacy, &s;hould pay no great reverence to a proud &s;cholar, who con&s;iders the endearments of his wife, and the care&s;&s;es of his children as plea&s;ures unworthy of him. It is agreed by all the biographers of Milton, that he was not very tender in his di&s;po&s;ition; he was rather boldly honourable, than delicately kind; and Mr. Dryden &s;eems to in&s;inuate, that he was not much &s;ubject to love. <Q REND="inline">"His rhimes, &s;ays he, flow &s;tiff from him, and that too at an age when love makes every man a rhym&s;ter, tho' not a poet. There are, methinks, in Milton's love|&s;onnets more of art than nature; he &s;eems to have con&s;idered the pa&s;&s;ion philo&s;ophically, rather than felt it intimately."</Q></P>
<P>In reading Milton's gallantry the brea&s;t will glow, but feel no palpitations; we admire the po|etry,
<PB N="117" REF="122">
but do not melt with tenderne&s;s; and want of feeling in an author &s;eldom fails to leave the reader cold; but from whatever cau&s;e his aver&s;i|on proceeded, &s;he was at la&s;t prevailed upon by her relations, who could fore&s;ee the dangers of a matrimonial quarrel, to make a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and &s;he was again received with tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Philips has thus related the &s;tory.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'It was then generally thought, &s;ays he, that Milton had a de&s;ign of marrying one of Dr. Davy's daughters, a very hand&s;ome and witty gentlewo|man, but aver&s;e, as it is &s;aid, to this motion; however the intelligence of this cau&s;ed ju&s;tice Powel's family to &s;et all engines at work to re&s;tore the married woman to the &s;tation in which they a little before had planted her. At la&s;t this de|vice was pitched upon. There dwelt in the lane of St. Martin's Le Grand, which was hard by, a relation of our author's, one Blackborough, whom it was known he often vi&s;ited, and upon this occa&s;ion the vi&s;its were more narrowly ob|&s;erved, and po&s;&s;ibly there might be a combi|nation between both parties, the friends on both &s;ides con&s;enting in the &s;ame action, tho' in different behalfs. One time above the re&s;t, mak|ing his u&s;ual vi&s;its, his wife was ready in ano|ther room; on a &s;udden he was &s;urprized to &s;ee one, whom he thought never to have &s;een more, making &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and begging pardon on her knees before him. He might proba|bly at fir&s;t make &s;ome &s;hew of aver&s;ion, and rejection, but partly his own generous nature, more inclinable to reconciliation than to per|&s;everance in anger and revenge, and partly the &s;trong interce&s;&s;ion of friends on both &s;ides, &s;oon brought him to an act of oblivion and a firm league of peace for the future; and it was at length concluded that &s;he &s;hould remain at a

<P>Mr. Fenton ob&s;erves, that it is not to be doubted but the abovementioned interview be|tween Milton and his wife mu&s;t wonderfully af|fect him; and that perhaps the impre&s;&s;ions it made on his imagination contributed much to the painting of that pathetic &s;cene in Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, b. 10. in which Eve addre&s;&s;es her&s;elf to Adam for pardon and peace, now at his feet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>About the year 1644 our author wrote a &s;mall piece in one &s;heet 4to, under this title, Education, to Mr. Samuel Hartly, reprinted at the end of his Poems on &s;everal occa&s;ions; and in the &s;ame year he publi&s;hed at London in 4to, his Areo|pagitica, or a &s;peech of Mr. J. Milton for the liberty of unlicen&s;ed printing, to the Parliament of England.</P>
<P>In 1645 his Juvenile Poems were printed at London, and about this time his zeal for the republican party had &s;o far recommended him, that a de&s;ign was formed of making him adju|tant-general in Sir William Waller's army; but the new modelling the army proved an ob&s;truc|tion to that advancement. Soon after the march of Fairfax and Cromwell with the whole army through the city, in order to &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;ur|rection which Brown and Ma&s;&s;ey were endea|vouring to rai&s;e there, again&s;t the army's pro|ceedings, he left his great hou&s;e in Barbican, for a &s;maller in High Holborn, where he pro|&s;ecuted his &s;tudies till after the King's trial and death, when he publi&s;hed his Tenure of Kings

and Magi&s;trates: His Ob&s;ervations on the Articles of peace between James Earl of Ormond for King Charles I. on the one hand, and the Iri&s;h Rebels and Papi&s;ts on the other hand; and a letter &s;ent by Ormond to colonel Jones governor of Dublin; and a repre&s;entation of the Scotch Pre&s;bytery at Belfa&s;t in Ireland.</P>
<P>He was now admitted into the &s;ervice of the Commonwealth, and was made Latin Secretary to the Council of State, who re&s;olved neither to write nor receive letters but in the Latin tongue, which was common to all &s;tates.</P>
<P>And it were to be wi&s;hed, <Q>'&s;ays Dr. Newton, that &s;ucceeding Princes would follow their ex|ample, for in the opinion of very wi&s;e men, the univer&s;ality of the French language will make way for the univer&s;ality of the French Monarchy. Milton was perhaps the fir&s;t in|&s;tance of a blind man's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the place of a &s;ecretary; which no doubt was a great in|convenience to him in his bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' &s;ome|times a political u&s;e might be made of it, as men's natural infirmities are often pleaded in excu&s;e for their not doing what they have no great inclination to do. Dr. Newton relates an in&s;tance of this. When Cromwell, as we may collect from Whitlocke, for &s;ome rea&s;ons delayed artfully to &s;ign the treaty concluded with Sweden, and the Swedi&s;h amba&s;&s;ador made frequent complaints of it, it was excu&s;ed to him, becau&s;e Milton on account of his blind|ne&s;s, proceeded &s;lower in bu&s;ine&s;s, and had not yet put the articles of treaty into Latin. Upon which the amba&s;&s;ador was greatly &s;urprized that things of &s;uch con&s;equence &s;hould be en|tru&s;ted to a blind man; for he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily employ an amanuen&s;is, and that amanuen&s;is might divulge the articles; and &s;aid, it was ve|ry wonderful there &s;hould be only one man in
<PB N="120" REF="125">
England who could write Latin, and he a blind one.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus we have &s;een Milton rai&s;ed to the dig|nity of Latin Secretary. It is &s;omewhat &s;trange, that in times of general confu&s;ion, when a man of parts has the faire&s;t opportunity to play off his abilities to advantage, that Milton did not ri&s;e &s;ooner, nor to a greater elevation; he was employed by tho&s;e in authority only as a wri|ter, which conferred no power upon him, and kept him in a kind of ob&s;curity, who had from nature all that was proper for the field as well as the cabinet; for we are a&s;&s;ured that Milton was a man of confirmed courage.</P>
<P>In 1651 our author publi&s;hed his Pro Populo Anglicano Defen&s;io, for which he was rewarded by the Commonwealth with a pre&s;ent of a thou|&s;and pounds, and had a con&s;iderable hand in correcting and poli&s;hing a piece written by his nephew Mr. John Philips, and printed at Lon|don 1652, under this title, Joannis Philippi An|gli Re&s;ponfio ad Apologiam Anonymi cuju&s;dam Tenebrionis pro Rege &amp; Populo Anglicano infanti&s;|&s;imam. During the writing and publi&s;hing this book, he lodged at one Thom&s;on's, next door to the Bull-head tavern Charing-Cro&s;s; but he &s;oon removed to a Garden-hou&s;e in Petty-France, next door to lord Scudamore's, where he remained from the year 1652 till within a few weeks of the Re&s;toration. In this hou&s;e, his fir&s;t wife dying in child-bed, 1652, he married a &s;econd, Catherine, the daughter of Captain Woodcock of Hackney, who died of a con&s;umption in three months af|ter &s;he had been brought to bed of a daughter. This &s;econd marriage was about two or three years after he had been wholly deprived of his &s;ight; for by rea&s;on of his continual &s;tudies, and the head-ach, to which he was &s;ubject from his youth, and his perpetual tampering with phy&s;ic,
<PB N="121" REF="126">
his eyes had been decaying for twelve years be|fore.</P>
<P>In 1654 he publi&s;hed his Defen&s;io Secunda; and the year following his Defen&s;io pro Se. Be|ing now at ea&s;e from his &s;tate adver&s;aries, and political controver&s;ies, he had lei&s;ure again to pro&s;ecute his own &s;tudies, and private de&s;igns, particularly his Hi&s;tory of Britain, and his new The&s;aurus Linguae Latinae, according to the me|thod of Robert Stevens, the manu&s;cript of which contained three large volumes in folio, and has been made u&s;e of by the editors of the Cam|bridge Dictionary, printed 4to, 1693.</P>
<P>In 1658 he publi&s;hed Sir Walter Raleigh's Ca|binet-Council; and in 1659 a Treati&s;e of the Civil Power in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cau&s;es, Lond. 12mo. and Con&s;iderations touching the likelie&s;t Means to remove Hirelings out of the Church; where|in are al&s;o Di&s;cour&s;es of Tithes, Church-fees, Church-Revenues, and whether any Maintenance of Mini|&s;ters can be &s;ettled in Law, Lond. 1659, 12mo.</P>
<P>Upon the di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament by the army, after Richard Cromwell had been obliged to re&s;ign the Protector&s;hip, Milton wrote a letter, in which he lays down the model of a common|wealth; not &s;uch as he judged the be&s;t, but what might be the readie&s;t &s;ettled at that time, to prevent the re&s;toration of kingly government and dome&s;tic di&s;orders till a more favourable &s;ea&s;on, and better di&s;po&s;itions for erecting a per|fect democracy. He drew up likewi&s;e another piece to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which &s;eems to have been addre&s;&s;ed to general Monk; and he pub|li&s;hed in February 1659, his ready and ea&s;y way to e&s;tabli&s;h a free Commonwealth. Soon after this he publi&s;hed his brief notes upon a late &s;ermon, entitled, the Fear of God and the King, printed in 4to, Lond. 1660. Ju&s;t before the re&s;toration he was removed from his office

of Latin &s;ecretary, and concealed him&s;elf till the act of oblivion was publi&s;hed; by the advice of his friends he ab&s;conded till the event of pub|lic affairs &s;hould direct him what cour&s;e to take, for this purpo&s;e he retired to a friend's hou&s;e in Bartholomew-Clo&s;e, near We&s;t-Smithfield, till the general amne&s;ty was delared.</P>
<P>The act of oblivion, &s;ays Mr. Phillips, prov|ing as favourable to him, as could be hoped or expected, through the interce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome that &s;tood his friends both in Council and Parliament; particularly in the Hou&s;e of Commons, Mr. Andrew Marvel member for Hull, and who has prefixed a copy of ver&s;es before his Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, acted vigorou&s;ly in his behalf, and made a con&s;iderable party for him, &s;o that together with John Goodwin of Coleman-Street, he was only &s;o far excepted as not to bear any office in the Commonwealth; but as this is one of the mo&s;t important circum&s;tances in the life of our author, we &s;hall give an account of it at large, from Mr. Richard&s;on, in his life of Milton, prefixed to his Explanatory Notes, and Remarks on Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</P>
<P>His words are <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'That Milton e&s;caped is well known, but not how. By the accounts we have, he was by the Act of Indemnity only incapacitated for any public employment. This is a notorious mi&s;take, though Toland, the bi&s;hop of Sarum, Fenton, &amp;c. have gone into it, confounding him with Goodwin; their ca&s;es were very different, as I found upon enquiry. Not to take a matter of this importance upon tru&s;t, I had fir&s;t recour&s;e to the Act it&s;elf. Milton is not among the ex|cepted. If he was &s;o conditionally pardoned, it mu&s;t then be, by a particular in&s;trument. That
<PB N="123" REF="128">
could not be after he had been purified entirely by the general indemnity, nor was it likely the King, who had declared from Breda, he would pardon all but whom the Parliament &s;hould judge unworthy of it, and had thus lodged the matter with them, &s;hould, before they came to a determination, be&s;tow a private act of indulgence to one &s;o notorious as Milton. It is true, Rapin &s;ays, &s;everal principal republicans applied for mercy, while the Act was yet depending, but quotes no authority; and upon &s;earch, no &s;uch pardon appears on record, though many are two or three years after, but then they are without re&s;trictions; &s;ome people were willing to have a particular, as well as a general pardon; but what|ever was the ca&s;e of others, there was a rea&s;on be&s;ides what has been already noted, that no &s;uch favour would be &s;hewn to Milton. The Hou&s;e of Commons, June 16, 1660, vote the King to be moved to call in his two books, and that of John Goodwin, written in ju&s;tification of the murder of the King, in order to be burnt, and that the Attorney General do proceed again&s;t them by indictment. June 27, an Order of Coun|cil reciting that Vote of the 16th, and that the per&s;ons were not to be found, directs a Procla|mation for calling in Milton's two books, which are here explained, to be that again&s;t Salma&s;ius, and the Eikon Ba&s;ilike, as al&s;o Goodwin's book; and a Proclamation was i&s;&s;ued accordingly, and another to the &s;ame purpo&s;e the 13th of Augu&s;t: as for Goodwin he narrowly e&s;caped for his life, but he was voted to be excepted out of the Act of Indemnity, among&s;t the twenty de&s;igned to have penalties inflicted &s;hort of death, and Au|gu&s;t 27, the&s;e books of Milton and Goodwin were burnt by the hangman. The Act of Obli|vion, according to Kennet's Regi&s;ter, was pa&s;&s;ed the 29th. It is &s;een by this account, that Mil|ton's
<PB N="124" REF="129">
per&s;on and Goodwin's are &s;eparated, tho' their books are blended together. As the King's intention appeared to be a pardon to all but ac|tual regicides, as Burnet &s;ays, it is odd, he &s;hould a&s;&s;ert in the &s;ame breath, almo&s;t all peo|ple were &s;urprized that Goodwin and Milton e&s;caped cen&s;ure. Why &s;hould it be &s;o &s;trange, they being not concerned in the King's blood? that he was forgot, as Toland &s;ays, &s;ome peo|ple imagined, is very unlikely. However, it is certain, from what has been &s;hewn from bi&s;hop Kennet, he was not. That he &s;hould be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from Goodwin, with advantage, will ju&s;tly appear &s;trange; for his va&s;t merit, as an ho|ne&s;t man, a great &s;cholar, and a mo&s;t excellent writer, and his &s;ame, on that account, will hard|ly be thought the cau&s;es, e&s;pecially when it is remembered Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t was not produced, and the writings, on which his va&s;t reputation &s;tood, are now become criminal, and tho&s;e mo&s;t, which were the main pillars of his fame. Goodwin was an incon&s;iderable offender, compared with him; &s;ome &s;ecret cau&s;e mu&s;t be recurred to in accounting for this indulgence. I have heard that &s;ecretary Morrice, and Sir Thomas Clarges were his friends, and managed matters artfully in his favour: doubtle&s;s they, or &s;ome body el&s;e did, and they very probably, as being powerful friends at that time. But &s;till how came they to put their intere&s;t at &s;uch a &s;tretch, in favour of a man &s;o notoriou&s;ly obnoxious? perplexed, and inqui&s;itive as I was, I at length found the &s;ecret. It was Sir William Davenant obtained his re|mi&s;&s;ion, in return of his own life, procured by Milton's intere&s;t, when him&s;elf was under con|demnation, Anno 1630. A life was owing to Milton (Davenant's) and it was paid nobly; Mil|ton's for Davenant, at Davenant's interce&s;&s;ion. The management of the affair in the hou&s;e, whe|ther

<P>This account Mr. Richard&s;on had from Mr. Pope, who was informed of it by Betterton, the celebrated actor, who was fir&s;t brought upon the &s;tage by Sir William Davenant, and honoured with an intimacy with him, &s;o that no better authority need be produced to &s;upport any fact.</P>
<P>Milton being &s;ecured by his pardon, appeared a|gain in public, and removed to Jewin-&s;treet, where he married his third wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of Mr. Min&s;hul of Che&s;hire, recommended to him by his friend Dr. Paget, to whom he was relat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d, but he had no children by her: &s;oon after the re&s;toration he was offered the place of Latin &s;e|cretary to the King, which, notwith&s;tanding the importunities of his wife, he refu&s;ed: we are in|formed, that when his wife pre&s;&s;ed him to comply with the times, and accept the King's offer, he made an&s;wer, <Q REND="inline">'You are in the right, my dear, you, as other women, would ride in your coach; for me, my aim is to live and die an hone&s;t man.'</Q> Soon after his marriage with his third wife, he removed to a hou&s;e in the Artillery Walk, leading to Bun|hill-fields, where he continued till his death, exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">pt during the plague, in 1665, when he retired with his family to St. Giles's Chalfont Buckingham&s;hire, at which time his Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t was fini&s;hed, tho' not publi&s;hed till 1667. Mr. Philips ob&s;erves, that the &s;ubject of that poem was fir&s;t de&s;igned for a tragedy, and in the fourth book of the poem, &s;ays he, there are ten ver&s;es, which, &s;everal years be|fore the poem was begun, were &s;hewn to me, and &s;ome others, as de&s;igned for the very beginning of the tragedy. The ver&s;es are,<Q><L>O thou that with &s;urpa&s;&s;ing glory crown'd</L>

<P>Mr. Philips further ob&s;erves, that there was a very remarkable circum&s;tance in the compo&s;ure of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, which, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have particular rea&s;on to remember, for whereas I had the pe|ru&s;al of it from the very beginning, for &s;ome years, as I went from time to time to vi&s;it him, in a parcel of ten, twenty, or thirty ver&s;es at a time, which being written by whatever hand came next, might po&s;&s;ibly want correction, as to the orthography and pointing; having, as the &s;um|mer came on, not been &s;hewn any for a con&s;ider|able while, and de&s;iring the rea&s;on thereof, was an&s;wered, that his vein never happily &s;lowed but from the autumnal equinox to the vernal, and that whatever he attempted at other times, was never to his &s;atisfaction, though he courted his fancy never &s;o much; &s;o that in all the years he was about his poem, he may be &s;aid to have &s;pent but half his time therein<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Milton, p. 40.</NOTE>'</Q> Mr. Toland imagines that Mr. Philips mu&s;t be mi&s;taken in re|gard to the time, &s;ince Milton, in his Latin Elegy upon the Approach of the Spring, declares the contrary, and that his poetic talent returned with the &s;pring.

<P>After the work was ready for the pre&s;s, it was near being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the ignorance, or malice of the licen&s;er, who, among other trivial objections, ima|gined there was trea&s;on in that noble &s;imile, b. i. v. 594.<Q><L>&mdash;As when the &s;un new ris'n</L>

<P>The ignorance of this licen&s;er, in objecting to this noble &s;imile, has indeed perpetuated his name, but it is with no advantage; he, no doubt, ima|gined, that <HI>Perplexes Monarchs</HI> was levelled a|gain&s;t the reigning Prince, which is, perhaps, the
<PB N="128" REF="133">
highe&s;t &s;imile in our language; how ridiculou&s;ly will people talk who are blinded by prejudice, or heat|ed by party. But to return: After Milton had fi|ni&s;hed this noble work of genius, which does ho|nour to human nature, he di&s;po&s;ed of it to a Book|&s;eller for the &s;mall price of fifteen pounds; under &s;uch prejudice did he then labour, and the payment of the fifteen pounds was to depend upon the &s;ale of two numerous impre&s;&s;ions. This engagement with his Book&s;eller proves him extremely igno|rant of that &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s, for he might be well a&s;&s;ured, that if two impre&s;&s;ions &s;old, a great deal of money mu&s;t be returned, and how he could di&s;|po&s;e of it thus conditionally for fifteen pounds, ap|pears &s;trange; but while it proves Milton's ig|norance, or inattention about his intere&s;t in this affair, it, at the &s;ame time, demon&s;trates the Book&s;eller's hone&s;ty; for he could not be ignorant what money would be got by two nu|merous editions. After this great work was pub|li&s;hed, however, it lay &s;ome time in ob&s;curity, and had the Book&s;eller advanced the &s;um &s;tipulated, he would have had rea&s;on to repent of his bar|gain. It was generally reported, that the late lord Somers fir&s;t gave Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t a reputation; but Mr. Richard&s;on ob&s;erves, that it was known and e&s;teemed long before there was &s;uch a man as lord Somers, as appears by a pompous edition of it printed by &s;ub&s;cription in 1688, where, a|mong&s;t the li&s;t of Sub&s;cribers, are the names of lord Dor&s;et, Waller, Dryden, Sir Robert How|ard, Duke, Creech, Flatman, Dr. Aldrich, Mr. Atterbury, Sir Roger L'E&s;trange, lord Somers, then only John Somers, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Mr. Richard&s;on fur|ther informs us, that he was told by Sir George Hungerford, an ancient Member of Parliament, that Sir John Denham came into the Hou&s;e one morning with a &s;heet of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, wet from the pre&s;s, in his hand, and being asked what he
<PB N="129" REF="134">
was reading? he an&s;wered, part of the noble&s;t poem that ever was written in any language, or in any age; however, it is certain that the book was unknown till about two years after, when the earl of Dor&s;et recommended it, as appears from the following &s;tory related to Mr. Richard&s;on, by Dr. Tancred Robin&s;on, an eminent phy&s;ician in Lon|don, who was informed, by Sir Fleetwood Sheppard, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that the earl, in company with that gentleman, looking over &s;ome books in Little Britain, met with Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t; and being &s;urprized with &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in turning it over, bought it. The Book|&s;eller de&s;ired his lord&s;hip to &s;peak in its favour, &s;ince he liked it, as the impre&s;&s;ion lay on his hands as wa&s;te paper. The earl having read the poem, &s;ent it to Mr. Dryden, who, in a &s;hort time, returned it with this an&s;wer: This man cuts us all, and the ancients too.'</Q></P>
<P>Critics have differed as to the &s;ource from which our drew the fir&s;t hint of writing Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t; Peek conjectures that it was from a celebrated Spani&s;h Romance called Guzman, and Dr. Zachary Pearce, now bi&s;hop of Bangor, has alledged, that he took the fir&s;t hint of it from an Italian Tragedy, called I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Paradi&s;o Per&s;o, &s;till extant, and printed many years before he entered on his de&s;ign. Mr. Lauder in his E&s;&s;ay on Milton's U&s;e and Imitation of the Moderns, has in&s;inuated that Milton's fir&s;t hint of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, was taken from a Tragedy of the celebrated Grotius, called Adamus Exul, and that Milton has not thought it beneath him to tran&s;plant &s;ome of that author's beauties into his noble work, as well as &s;ome other flowers called from the gardens of inferior genius's; but by an elegance of art, and force of nature, peculiar to him, he has drawn the admiration of the world upon pa&s;&s;ages, which in their original authors, &s;tood neglected and undi&s;tingui&s;hed. If at any time he has adopted a &s;entiment of a cotemporary poet,
<PB N="130" REF="135">
it de&s;erves another name than plagiary; for, as Garth expre&s;&s;es it, in the ca&s;e of Dryden, who was charged with plagiary, that, like ladies of quality who borrow beggars children, it is only to cloath them the better, and we know no higher compli|ment could have been paid to the&s;e moderns, than that of Milton's doing them the honour to peru&s;e them, for, like a Prince's accepting a pre&s;ent from a &s;ubject, the glory is reflected on him who offers the gift, not on the Monarch who accepts it. But as Mr. Lauder's book has lately made &s;o great a noi&s;e in the world, we mu&s;t beg leave to be a little more particular.</P>
<P>Had Mr. Lauder pur&s;ued his plan of di&s;clo&s;ing Milton's re&s;ources, and tracing his &s;teps through the va&s;t tracts of erudition that our author travelled, with candour and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionatene&s;s, the de&s;ign would have been noble and u&s;eful; he then would have produced authors into light who were before unknown; have recommended &s;acred poetry, and it would have been extreamly plea&s;ing to have followed Milton over all his cla&s;&s;ic ground, and &s;een where the noble&s;t genius of the world thought proper to pluck a flower, and by what art he was able to rear upon the foundation of nature &s;o magnificent, &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing a fabric: but in place of that, Mr. Lauder &s;uffers him&s;elf to be overcome by his pa&s;&s;ion, and in&s;tead of tracing him as a man of ta&s;te, and exten&s;ive read|ing, he hunts him like a malefactor, and &s;eems to be determined on his execution.</P>
<P>Mr. Lauder could never &s;eparate the idea of the author of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, and the enemy of King Charles. Lauder has great reading, but greater ill nature; and Mr. Douglas has &s;hewn how much his evidence is invalidated by &s;ome interpolations which Lauder has &s;ince owned. It is pity &s;o much cla&s;|&s;ical knowledge &s;hould have been thus pro&s;tituted by
<PB N="131" REF="136">
Lauder, which might have been of &s;ervice to his country; but party-zeal &s;eldom knows any bounds. The ingenious Mo&s;es Brown, &s;peaking of this man's furious attack upon Milton, has the following pretty &s;tanza.<Q><L>The Owl will hoot that cannot &s;ing,</L>

<P>But if Lauder is hot and furious, his pa&s;&s;ion &s;oon &s;ub&s;ides. Upon hearing that the grand-daughter of Milton was living, in an ob&s;cure &s;ituation in Shoreditch, he readily embraced the opportunity, in his po&s;t&s;cript, of recommending her to the public favour; upon which, &s;ome gentlemen affected with the &s;ingularity of the circum&s;tance, and a|&s;hamed that our country &s;hould &s;uffer the grand|daughter of one from whom it derives its mo&s;t la&s;ting and brighte&s;t honour, to langui&s;h neglected, procured Milton's Comus to be performed for her benefit at Drury Lane, on the 5th of April, 1750: upon which, Mr. Garrick &s;poke a Prologue writ|ten by a gentleman, who zealou&s;ly promoted the benefit, and who, at this time, holds the highe&s;t rank in literature.</P>

<P>In the year 1670 our author publi&s;hed at Lon|don in 4to. his Hi&s;tory of Britain, that part, e&s;pe|cially, now called England, from the fir&s;t traditional Beginning, continued to the Norman Conque&s;t, collected out of the anciente&s;t and be&s;t authors thereof. It is reprinted in the fir&s;t volume of Dr. Kennet's compleat Hi&s;tory of England. Mr. To|land in his Life of Milton, page 43, ob&s;erves, that we have not this hi&s;tory as it came out of his hands, for the licen&s;ers, tho&s;e &s;worn officers to de&s;troy learning, liberty, and good &s;en&s;e, expunged &s;eve|ral pa&s;&s;ages of it, wherein he expo&s;ed the &s;uper|&s;tition, pride, and cunning of the Popi&s;h monks in the Saxon times, but applied by the &s;agacious licen&s;ers to Charles IId's bi&s;hops. In 1681 a con|&s;iderable pa&s;&s;age which had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in the publication of this hi&s;tory, was printed at London in 4to under this title: Mr. John Milton's cha|racter of the Long Parliament and A&s;&s;embly of Divines in 1651, omitted in his other works, and never before printed. It is reported, and from the foregoing character it appears probable, that Mr. Milton had lent mo&s;t of his per&s;onal e&s;tate upon the public faith, which when he &s;omewhat ear|ne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed to have re&s;tored, after a long, and chargeable attendance, met with very &s;harp re|bukes;
<PB N="134" REF="139">
upon which, at la&s;t de&s;pairing of any &s;uc|ce&s;s in this affair, he was forced to return from them poor and friendle&s;s, having &s;pent all his mo|ney, and wearied all tho&s;e who e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e, and he had not, probably, mended his circum|&s;tances in tho&s;e days, but by performing &s;uch &s;er|vice for them, as afterwards he did, for which &s;carce any thing would appear too great. In 1671 he publi&s;hed at London in 8vo. Paradi&s;e Regained, a Poem in four Books, to which is added Samp|&s;on Agoni&s;tes: there is not a &s;tronger proof of hu|man weakne&s;s, than Milton's preferring this Poem of Paradi&s;e Regained, to Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, and it is a natural and ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, that the Me&s;&s;iah in Paradi&s;e Regained, with all his meekne&s;s, unaf|fected dignity, and clear rea&s;oning, makes not &s;o great a figure, as when in the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t he ap|pears cloathed in the Terrors of Almighty ven|geance, wielding the thunder of Heaven, and riding along the &s;ky in the chariot of power, drawn, as Milton greatly expre&s;&s;es it, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'with Four Cherubic Shapes; when he comes dre&s;t in awful Maje&s;ty, and hurls the apo&s;tate &s;pirits headlong in|to the fiery gulph of bottomle&s;s perdition, there to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire, who dur&s;t defy the Omnipotent to arms.'</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Newton has di&s;&s;ented from the general opi|nion of mankind, concerning Paradi&s;e Regained: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Certainly, &s;ays he, it is very worthy of the author, and contrary to what Mr. Toland relates, Milton may be &s;een in Paradi&s;e Regained as well as Pa|radi&s;e Lo&s;t; if it is inferior in poetry, I know not whether it is inferior in &s;entiment; if it is le&s;s de&s;criptive, it is more argumentative; if it does not &s;ometimes ri&s;e &s;o high, neither doth it ever &s;ink below; and it has not met with the approbation it de&s;erves, only becau&s;e it has not been more read and con&s;idered.

The great beauty of it is the contra&s;t between the two characters of the tempter and Our Saviour, the artful &s;ophi&s;try, and &s;pecious in&s;inuations of the one, refuted by the &s;trong &s;en&s;e, and manly eloquence of the o|ther.'</Q> The fir&s;t thought of Paradi&s;e Regained was owing to Elwood the Quaker, as he him|&s;elf relates the occa&s;ion, in the Hi&s;tory of his own Life.

4to. a Declaration of the Letters Patent of the King of Poland, John III. elected on the 22d of May, Anno Dom. 1674, now faithfully tran&s;lated from the Latin copy.

His State Letters were printed at London 1676 in 12mo. and tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, and printed 1694, as his Brief Hi&s;tory of Mu&s;covy, and of their le&s;s known Countries, lying Ea&s;tward of Ru&s;&s;ia, as far as Cathay, was in 1682 in 8vo. His Hi&s;torical, Poetical, and Mi&s;cellaneous Works were printed in three volumes in folio 1698 at London, though Am&s;terdam is mentioned in the title page with the life of the author, by Mr. Toland; but the mo&s;t compleat and elegant edition of his pro&s;e works was printed in two volumes in folio at London 1738, by the rev.

In this edition the &s;everal pieces are di&s;po&s;ed according to the order in which they were printed, with the edition of a Latin Tract, omitted by Mr. Toland, concerning the Rea&s;ons of the War with Spain in 1655, and &s;e|veral pages in the Hi&s;tory of Great Britain, ex|punged

by the licen&s;ers of the pre&s;s, and not to be met with in any former impre&s;&s;ions. It perhaps is not my province to make any remarks upon the two grand di&s;putations, that have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the friends and enemies of Charles I. about the author of the Ba&s;ilike, and the Commi&s;&s;ion grant|ed to the Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts; as to the la&s;t, the reader, if he plea&s;es, may con&s;ult at the Life of Lord Brog|hill, in which he will find the my&s;tery of iniquity di&s;clo&s;ed, and Charles entirely freed from the lea&s;t appearance of being concerned in granting &s;o execrable a commi&s;&s;ion; the forgery is there fully related, and there is all the evidence the na|ture of the thing will admit of, that the King's me|mory has been injured by &s;o ba&s;e an imputation. As to the fir&s;t, it is &s;omewhat difficult to deter|mine, whether his Maje&s;ty was or was not the author of the&s;e pious Meditations; Mr. Birch has &s;ummed up the evidence on both &s;ides; we &s;hall not take upon us to determine on which it pre|ponderates; it will be proper here to ob&s;erve, the chief evidence again&s;t the King in this contention, is, Dr. Gauden, bi&s;hop of Exeter, who claimed that book as his, and who, in his letters to the earl of Clarendon, values him&s;elf upon it, and becomes trouble&s;omely &s;ollicitous for preferment on that account; he likewi&s;e told the two princes that the Ba&s;ilike was not written by their father, but by him; now one thing is clear, that Gauden was altogether without parts; his Life of Hooker, which is the only genuine and indi&s;puted work of his, &s;hews him a man of no extent of thinking; his &s;tile is loo&s;e, and negligently florid, which is diametrically oppo&s;ite to that of the&s;e Meditati|ons. Another circum&s;tance much invalidates his evidence, and dimini&s;hes his reputation for ho|ne&s;ty. After he had, for a con&s;iderable time, pro|fe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Prote&s;tant, and been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an Engli&s;h bi&s;hopric, and di&s;covered an ar|dent

<P>In a work of Milton's called Icon Ocla&s;tes, or the Image broken, he takes occa&s;ion to charge the king with borrowing a prayer from Sir Phi|lip Sidney's Arcadia, and placing it in his Medi|tations without acknowledging the favour. Soon after the &s;entence of the Regicides had been put in execution the&s;e Meditations were publi&s;hed, and as Anthony by &s;hewing the body of murdered Cae&s;ar, excited the compa&s;&s;ion of multitudes, and rai&s;ed their indignation again&s;t the enemies of that illu&s;trious Roman; &s;o the&s;e Meditations had much the &s;ame effect in England. The Pre&s;by|terians loudly exclaimed again&s;t the murder of the King; they a&s;&s;erted, that his per&s;on was &s;a|cred, and &s;pilling his blood upon a &s;caffold was a &s;tain upon the Engli&s;h annals, which the late&s;t time could not obliterate. The&s;e tragical com|plaints gaining ground, and the fury which was lately exerci&s;ed again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, &s;ub&s;iding into a tenderne&s;s for his memory, heightened by the con&s;ideration of his piety, which the&s;e Meditati|ons &s;erved to revive, it was thought proper, in order to appea&s;e the minds of the people, that an an&s;wer &s;hould be wrote to them.</P>
<P>In this task Milton engaged, and pro&s;ecuted it with vigour; but the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer of that poet, upon reading it will not fail to di&s;cover a &s;pirit of bitterne&s;s, an air of peevi&s;h|ne&s;s and re&s;entment to run through the whole.

Dr. Newton is of opinion that this fact is not well &s;upported, for it is related chiefly upon the authority of Henry Hills the printer, who had frequently affirmed it to Dr. Gill, and Dr. Bernard, his phy&s;icians, as they them&s;elves have te&s;tified; but tho' Hills was Cromwell's printer, yet afterwards he turned Papi&s;t in the reign of King James II. in order to be that King's Printer; and it was at that time he u&s;ed to relate this &s;tory; &s;o that little credit is due to his te&s;timony. It is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible to believe Milton capable of &s;uch di&s;in|genuous meanne&s;s, to &s;erve &s;o bad a purpo&s;e, and there is as little rea&s;on for fixing it upon him, as he had to traduce the King for profan|ing the duty of prayer, with the polluted tra&s;h of romances; for in the be&s;t books of devotion, there are not many finer prayers, and the King might as lawfully borrow and apply it to his own purpo&s;e, as the apo&s;tle might make quota|tions from Heathen poems and plays; and it be|came Milton, the lea&s;t of all men, to bring &s;uch an accu&s;ation again&s;t the King, as he was him|&s;elf particularly fond of reading romances, and has made u&s;e of them in &s;ome of the be&s;t and late&s;t of his writings.</P>
<P>There have been various conjectures concerning the cau&s;e that produced in Milton &s;o great an aver&s;ion to Charles I. One is, that when Milton &s;tood candidate for a profe&s;&s;or&s;hip at Cambridge with his much e&s;teemed friend Mr. King, their intere&s;t and qualifications were equal, upon which his Maje&s;ty was required by his nomination to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ix the profe&s;&s;or; his an&s;wer was, let the be&s;t-na|tured man have it; to which they who heard him, immediately replied; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'then we are certain it cannot be Milton's, who was ever remarkable for a &s;tern ungovernable man.'</Q>&mdash;Whether
<PB N="140" REF="145">
this conjecture is ab&s;olutely true, we cannot deter|mine; but as it is not without probability, it has a right to be believed, till a more &s;atisfactory one can be given.</P>
<P>In whatever light Milton may be placed as a &s;tate&s;man, yet as a poet he &s;tands in one point of view without a rival; the &s;ublimity of his conceptions, the elevation of his &s;tile, the fertility of his imagination, and the conduct of his de&s;ign in Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t is inimitable, and cannot be enough admired.</P>

<P>This great man died at his hou&s;e at Bunhill, Nov. 15, 1674, and was interred near the body of his father, in the chancel of the church of St. Giles, Cripplegate. By his fir&s;t wife he had four children, a &s;on and three daughters. The daughters &s;urvived their father. Anne married a ma&s;ter-builder, and died in child-bed of her fir&s;t child, which died with her; Mary lived &s;ingle; Deborah left her father when &s;he was young, and went over to Ireland with a lady, and came to England again during the troubles of Ireland un|der King James II. She married Mr. Abraham Clark, a weaver in Spittal-fields, and died Aug. 24, 1727, in the 76th year of age. She had ten children, viz. &s;even &s;ons, and three daughters, but none of them had any children except one of her &s;ons named Caleb, and the younge&s;t daugh|ter,

who&s;e name is Elizabeth. Caleb went over to Fort St. George in the Ea&s;t-Indies, where he married and had two &s;ons, Abraham and I&s;aac; of the&s;e Abraham the elder came to England with governor Harri&s;on, but returned again upon advice of his father's death, and whether he or his bro|ther be now living is uncertain. Elizabeth, the younge&s;t child of Deborah, married Mr. Thomas Fo&s;ter, a weaver, and lives now in Hog-lane, Shoreditch, for whom Comus, as we have already ob&s;erved, was performed at Drury-Lane, and produced her a great benefit.

<P>The great learning and genius of Milton, have &s;carcely rai&s;ed him more admirers, than the part he acted upon the political &s;tage, has procured him enemies. He was in his inclination a thorough Republican, and in this he thought like a Greek or Roman, as he was very conver&s;ant with their writings. And one day Sir Robert Howard, who was a friend of Milton's, and a well wi&s;her to the liber|ty of his country, a&s;ked him, how he came to &s;ide with the Republicans? Milton an&s;wered, among other things, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Becau&s;e theirs was the mo&s;t frugal government; for the trappings of a Monarchy might &s;et up an ordinary Commonwealth.'</Q> But then his attachment to Cromwell mu&s;t be con|demned, as being neither con&s;i&s;tent with his re|publican principles, nor with his love of liberty. It may be rea&s;onably pre&s;umed, that he was far from entirely approving of Cromwell's proceed|ing; but con&s;idered him as the only per&s;on who could re&s;cue the nation from the tyranny of the Pre&s;byterians, who he &s;aw, were about to erect a wor&s;e dominion of their own upon the ruins of prelatical epi&s;copacy; for if experience may be
<PB N="144" REF="149">
allowed to teach us, the Pre&s;byterian government carries in it more of eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority, and approaches more to the thunder of the Vatican, than any other government under the &s;un. Milton was an enemy to &s;piritual &s;lavery, he thought the chains thrown upon the mind were the lea&s;t tolerable; and in order to &s;hake the pillars of mental u&s;urpation, he clo&s;ed with Cromwell and the independants, as he expected under them greater liberty of con&s;cience. In matters of re|ligion too, Milton has likewi&s;e given great offence, but in&s;idels have no rea&s;on to glory. No &s;uch man was ever among&s;t them. He was per&s;uaded of the truth of the chri&s;tian religion; he &s;tudied and admired the holy &s;criptures, and in all his writings he plainly di&s;covers a religious turn of mind.</P>
<P>When he wrote the Doctrine and Di&s;cipline of Divorce, he appears to have been a Calvini&s;t; but afterwards he entertained a more favourable opinion of Arminius. Some have thought that he was an Arian, but there are more expre&s;s pa&s;&s;ages in his works to overthrow this opinion, than any there are to confirm it. For in the conclu&s;ion of his Treati&s;e on Reformation, he thus &s;clemnly invokes the Trinity: <Q><P>'Thou therefore that &s;itte&s;t in light and glo|ry unapproachable, parent of angels and of men! next thee I implore omnipotent king, redeemer of that lo&s;t remnant, who&s;e nature thou did&s;t a&s;&s;ume, ineffable and everla&s;ting love! and thee the third &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the divine infinitude, illuminating &s;pirit, the joy and &s;olace of creat|ed things! one tri-per&s;onal god-head.'</P></Q></P>
<P>In the latter part of his life he was not a profe&s;&s;ed member of any particular &s;ect of chri&s;tians; he fre|quented no public wor&s;hip, nor u&s;ed any religious
<PB N="145" REF="150">
rite in his family; he was an enemy to all kinds of forms, and thought that all chri&s;tians had in &s;ome things corrupted the &s;implicity and purity of the go&s;pel. He believed that inward religion was the be&s;t, and that public communion had more of &s;hew in it, than any tendency to promote genu|ine piety and unaffected goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of our author were never very mean, nor very affluent; he lived above want, and was content with competency. His father &s;upported him during his travels. When he was appointed Latin &s;ecretary, his &s;allary amounted to 200 l. per ann. and tho' he was of the victorious party, yet he was far from &s;haring the &s;poils of his country. On the contrary, as we learn from his Second Defence, he &s;u&s;tained great lo&s;&s;es dur|ing the civil war, and was not at all favoured in the impo&s;ition of taxes, but &s;ometimes paid beyond his due proportion; and upon a turn of affairs, he was not only deprived of his place, but al&s;o lo&s;t 2000 l. which he had for &s;ecurity, put into the Exci&s;e office.</P>
<P>In the fire of London, his hou&s;e in Bread|&s;treet was burnt, before which accident foreigners have gone out of devotion, &s;ays Wood, to &s;ee the hou&s;e and chamber where he was born. Some time before he died, he &s;old the greate&s;t part of his library, as his heirs were not qualified to make a proper u&s;e of it, and as he thought he could di&s;po&s;e of it to greater advantage, than they could after his death. He died (&s;ays Dr. Newton) by one means or other worth 1500l. be&s;ides his hou&s;hold goods, which was no incompetent &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence for him, who was as great a philo&s;opher as a poet.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'She died, &s;ays Dr. Newton, very old, about twenty years ago, at Nantwich in Che&s;hire, and from the accounts of tho&s;e who had &s;een her, I have learned that &s;he confirmed &s;everal things related before; and particularly that her hu&s;|band u&s;ed to compo&s;e his poetry chiefly in the winter, and on his waking on a morning would make her write down &s;ometimes twenty or thir|ty ver&s;es: Being a&s;ked whether he did not of|ten read Homer and Virgil, &s;he under&s;tood it as an imputation upon him for &s;tealing from the&s;e authors, and an&s;wered with eagerne&s;s, that he &s;tole from no body but the mu&s;e that in|&s;pired him; and being a&s;ked by a lady pre&s;ent who the mu&s;e was, &s;he an&s;wered, it was God's grace and holy &s;pirit, that vi&s;ited him nightly.

<P>The reader will be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that this cen&s;ure of Milton's was before Dryden had made any great appearance in poetry, or compo&s;ed tho&s;e immortal works of genius, which have rai&s;ed eternal monuments to him, and carried his name to every country where poetry and ta&s;te are known. Some have thought that Dryden's genius was even &s;uperior to Milton's: That the latter chiefly &s;hines in but one kind of poetry; his thoughts are &s;ublime, and his language noble; but in what kind of writing has not Dryden been di&s;tingui&s;hed? He is in eve|ry thing excellent, &s;ays Congreve, and he has
<PB N="147" REF="152">
attempted nothing in which he has not &s;o &s;uc|ceeded as to be entitled to the fir&s;t reputation from it.</P>
<P>It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Milton was go|verned by &s;o mean a principle as envy, in his thus cen&s;uring Dryden. It is more natural to imagine, that as he was him&s;elf no friend to rhime, and finding Dryden in his early age peculiarly happy in the faculty of rhiming, without having thrown out any thoughts, which were in them&s;elves di&s;tingui&s;hedly great, Milton might, without the imputation of ill nature, characteri&s;e Dryden, as we have already &s;een.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the mo&s;t material incidents in the life of this great man, who if he had le&s;s honour during the latter part of his life than he de&s;erv|ed, it was owing to the unfavourable circum|&s;tances under which he laboured. It is always unplea&s;ing to a good man to find that they who have been di&s;tingui&s;hed for their parts, have not been equally &s;o for their moral qualities; and in this ca&s;e we may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that Milton was good as well as great; and that if he was mi&s;taken in his political principles, he was ho|ne&s;tly mi&s;taken, for he never deviated from his fir&s;t re&s;olution; no temptations could excite him to tempori&s;e, or to barter his honour for advan|tage; nor did he ever once pre&s;ume to partake of the &s;poils of his ruined country. Such quali|ties as the&s;e are great in them&s;elves, and who|ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them, has an unexceptionable claim to rank with the good.</P>
<P>We might have entered more minutely into the merit of Milton's poems, particularly the great work of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t; but we &s;hould reckon it ar|rogant as well as &s;uperfluous in us, to critici&s;e on a work who&s;e beauties have been di&s;played by the hand of Mr. Addi&s;on. That critic has
<PB N="148" REF="153">
illu&s;trated the mo&s;t remarkable pa&s;&s;ages in Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t; &s;uch as are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their &s;ublimity; and elevation; &s;uch who&s;e excellence is propriety; others rai&s;ed by the noblene&s;s of the language; and tho&s;e that are remarkable for energy and &s;trong rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>A later critic, the ingenious author of the Rambler, has animadverted upon Milton's ver&s;ifi|cation with great judgment; and has di&s;covered in &s;ome mea&s;ure that happy art, by which Mil|ton has conducted &s;o great a de&s;ign, with &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Mrs. KATHERINE PHILIPS,</HEAD>
<P>THE celebrated Orinda, was daughter of John Fowles of Buckler&s;bury, a mer|chant in London. She was born in the pari&s;h of St. Mary Wool-Church, 1631. Mr. Aubrey tells us, (in a MS. of his in Mr. A&s;hmole's &s;tudy, No. 18. Vol. 23.) that &s;he had the early part of her education from her cou&s;in Mrs. Blacket. At eight years old &s;he was removed to a &s;chool at Hackney, and &s;oon made great improvements under the care of Mrs. Salmon; &s;o great that whoever reads the account that Mr. Aubrey gives of her at that time of her life, will con&s;ider her &s;ucceeding progre&s;s to be no more than what might be naturally expected from &s;uch indica|tions
<PB N="149" REF="154">
of genius. He tells us, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that &s;he was ve|ry apt to learn, and made ver&s;es when &s;he was at &s;chool; that &s;he devoted her&s;elf to religious duties when &s;he was very young; that &s;he would then pray by her&s;elf an hour together; that &s;he had read the bible through before &s;he was full five years old; that &s;he could &s;ay, by heart, many chapters and pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture; was a frequent hearer of &s;ermons, which &s;he would bring away entire in her memory.'</Q></P>
<P>The above is extracted from Mr. Ballard's ac|count of the Ladies of Great Britain, who have been celebrated for their writings; and &s;erves to &s;hew the early piety of this amiable lady, who lived to be di&s;tingui&s;hed for her ripened un|der&s;tanding.&mdash;She became afterwards a perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of the French tongue, and learned the Italian under the tuition of her ingenious and worthy friend Sir Charles Cotterel. She was in|&s;tructed in the Pre&s;byterian principles, which it appears by her writings, &s;he de&s;erted, as &s;oon as her rea&s;on was &s;trong enough to exert it&s;elf in the examination of religious points. She warmly embraced the royal intere&s;t, and upon many oc|ca&s;ions was a &s;trenuous advocate for the autho|rity of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church.</P>
<P>She was married to James Philips of the Pri|ory of Cardigan, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> about the year 1647. By this gentleman &s;he had one &s;on, who died in his infancy, and one daughter, married to a gentle|man of Pembroke&s;hire. She proved an excel|lent wife, not only in the conjugal duties, and tender offices of love, but was highly &s;er|viceable to her hu&s;band in affairs, in which few wives are thought capable of being u&s;eful; for his fortune being much encumbered, &s;he exerted her intere&s;t with Sir Charles Cotterel, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, who admired her under|&s;tanding (for &s;he had few graces of per&s;on) in her
<PB N="150" REF="155">
hu&s;band's favour, who &s;oon extricated him from the difficulties under which he laboured. It no where appears that the hu&s;band of Mrs. Philips was a man of any abilities, and if he met with re&s;pect in the world, it was probably reflected from his wife. This lady had too much piety and good &s;en&s;e to &s;uffer her &s;uperior under&s;tanding to make her in&s;olent; on the other hand, &s;he always &s;peaks of her hu&s;band with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, under the name of Antenor. In a letter to Sir Charles Cotterel, after having mentioned her hu&s;|band in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms, and of his wil|lingne&s;s to forward her journey to London, in order to &s;ettle his perplexed affairs, &s;he adds <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"And I hope God will enable me to an&s;wer his expectations, by making me an in&s;trument of doing &s;ome hand&s;ome &s;ervice, which is the only ambition I have in the world, and which I would purcha&s;e with the hazard of my life. I am extreamly obliged to my lady Cork for remembering me with &s;o much indulgence; for her great de&s;ire to be troubled with my company; but above all for her readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t my endeavours for Antenor, which is the mo&s;t generous kindne&s;s can be done me."</P></Q></P>
<P>As this lady was born with a genius for poetry, &s;o &s;he began early in life to improve it, and compo&s;ed many poems on various occa&s;ions for her amu&s;ement, in her rece&s;s at Cardigan, and retirement el&s;ewhere. The&s;e being di&s;per&s;ed a|mong her friends and acquaintance, were by an unknown hand collected together, and publi&s;hed in 8vo. 1663, without her knowledge or con|&s;ent. This accident is &s;aid to have proved &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive to our poete&s;s, as to throw her into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">it of illne&s;s, and &s;he pours out her complaints in a letter to Sir Charles Cotterel, in which &s;he laments, in the mo&s;t affecting manner, the misfor|tune
<PB N="151" REF="156">
and the injuries which had been done to her by this &s;urreptitious edition of her Poems.</P>
<P>That Mrs. Philips might be di&s;plea&s;ed that her Poems were pabli&s;hed without her con&s;ent, is extremely probable, as by the&s;e means they might appear without many graces, and orna|ments which they otherwi&s;e would have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; but that it threw her into a &s;it of illne&s;s, no body who reads the human heart can believe. Surreptitious editions are a &s;ort of compliment to the merit of an author; and we are not to &s;uppo&s;e Mrs. Philips &s;o much a &s;aint, as to be &s;tlipt of all vanity, or that natural delight, which ari&s;es from the good opinion of others, however aukwardly it may be di&s;covered; and we may venture to affirm, that Mrs. Philips's illne&s;s pro|ceeded from &s;ome other cau&s;e, than what is here a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>The reputation of her abilities procured her the e&s;teem of many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction and fa&s;hion, and upon her going into Ireland with the vi&s;counte&s;s of Duncannon, to tran&s;act her hu&s;band's affairs there, her great merit &s;oon made her known to tho&s;e illu&s;trious peers, Ormond, Orrery, and Ro&s;common, and many other per|&s;ons of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion, who &s;hewed her &s;ingular marks of their e&s;teem. While Mrs. Philips re|mained in that kingdom, at the pre&s;&s;ing impor|tunity of the abovementioned noblemen, but par|ticularly lord Ro&s;common, &s;he tran&s;lated, from the French of Corneille, the tragedy of Pom|pey, which was brought upon the Iri&s;h &s;tage &s;omewhat again&s;t her inclination; however it was &s;everal times acted in the new theatre there, with very great applau&s;e in the years 1663, and 1664, in which la&s;t year it was made pub|lic. It was afterwards acted with equal ap|plau&s;e at the Duke of York's theatre, 1678. This

<P>She al&s;o tran&s;lated from the French of Corneille, a Tragedy called Horace; Sir John Denham added a fifth Act to this Play, which was acted at Court by Per&s;ons of Quality.

<P>While Mrs. Philips was in Ireland, &s;he was hap|py in carrying on her former intimacy with the fa|mous Jeremy Taylor, the bi&s;hop of Down and Connor, who had &s;ome time before done her much honour by writing, and publi&s;hing a Di&s;cour&s;e on the Nature, Offices, and Mea&s;ures of Friend&s;hip, with Rules for conducting it, in a letter addre&s;&s;ed to her. It is probable that this prelate's acquaint|ance with &s;o accompli&s;hed a lady as Mrs. Philips, might be one rea&s;on of his entertaining &s;o high an opinion of the fair &s;ex in general; it is certain he was a great admirer of them, by which the good &s;en&s;e, as well as piety, of that great man is demon|&s;trated; for whoever has &s;tudied life, examined the
<PB N="153" REF="158">
various motives of human actions, compared cha|racters, and, in a word, &s;crutinized the heart, will find that more real virtue, more genuine and un|affected goodne&s;s exi&s;t among&s;t the female &s;ex, than the other, and were their minds cultivated with equal care, and did they move in the bu&s;tle of life, they would not fall &s;hort of the men in the acute excellences; but the &s;oftne&s;s of their natures exempts them from action, and the blu&s;hes of beauty are not to be effaced by the rough &s;torms of adver&s;ity: that man is happy who enjoys in the con|jugal &s;tate, the endearments of love and innocence, and if his wife is le&s;s acquainted with the world than he, &s;he makes a large amends, by the artle&s;s blandi&s;hments of a delicate affection.</P>
<P>We are per&s;uaded our fair readers will not be di&s;plea&s;ed if we in&s;ert a paragraph from the di&s;cour&s;e already mentioned by this worthy church|man; it appearing to be &s;o &s;incere a tribute to their merit. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'But by the way, madam, you may &s;ee how I differ from the majority of tho&s;e cynics, who would not admit your &s;ex into the commu|nity of a noble friend&s;hip. I believe &s;ome wives have been the be&s;t friends in the world; and few &s;tories can outdo the noblene&s;s and piety of that lady, that &s;ucked the poi&s;onous purulent matter from the wounds of the brave Prince in the holy land, when an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in had pierced him with a venomed arrow: and if it be told that women cannot retain council, and therefore can be no brave friends, I can be&s;t confute them by the &s;to|ry of Porcia, who being fearful of the weakne&s;s of her &s;ex, &s;tabbed her&s;elf in the thigh to try how &s;he could bear pain; and finding her&s;elf con&s;tant enough to that &s;ufferance, gently chid her Bru|tus for not tru&s;ting her, &s;ince now &s;he perceived, that no torment could wre&s;t that &s;ecret from her, which &s;he hoped might be entru&s;ted to her. If
<PB N="154" REF="159">
there were no more things to be &s;aid for your &s;atisfaction, I could have made it di&s;putable, which have been more illu&s;trious in their friend|&s;hip, men or women. I cannot &s;ay that women are capable of all tho&s;e excellencies by which men can oblige the world, and therefore a female friend, in &s;ome ca&s;es, is not &s;o good a coun&s;ellor as a wi&s;e man, and cannot &s;o well defend my ho|nour, nor di&s;po&s;e of relief and a&s;&s;i&s;tances, if &s;he be under the power of another; but a woman can love as pa&s;&s;ionately, and conver&s;e as plea|&s;antly, and retain a &s;ecret as faithfully, and be u&s;eful in her proper mini&s;tries, and &s;he can die for her friend, as well as the brave&s;t Roman knight; a man is the be&s;t friend in trouble, but a woman may be equal to him in the days of joy: a woman can as well increa&s;e our comforts, but cannot &s;o well le&s;&s;en our &s;orrows, and there|fore we do not carry women with us when we go to fight; but in peaceful cities and times, women are the beauties of &s;ociety, and the pret|tine&s;&s;es of friend&s;hip, and when we con&s;ider that few per&s;ons in the world have all tho&s;e ex|cellences by which friend&s;hip can be u&s;eful, and illu&s;trious, we may as well allow women as men to be friends; &s;ince they have all that can be nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential to friend&s;hips, and tho&s;e cannot have all by which friend&s;hips can be accidentally improved.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus far this learned prelate, who&s;e te&s;timony in favour of women is the more con&s;iderable, as he can|not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been influenced by any par|ticular pa&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t for Mrs. Philips, who was or|dinary in her per&s;on, and was be&s;ides a married lady. In the year 1663 Mrs. Philips quitted Ireland, and went to Cardigan, where &s;he &s;pent the remaining part of that, and the beginning of the next year, in a &s;ort of melancholy retirement; as appears by her

Going to London, in or|der to relieve her oppre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits with the con|ver&s;ation of her friends there, &s;he was &s;eized by the &s;mall pox, and died of it (in Fleet &s;treet,) to the great grief of her acquaintance, in the 32d year of her age, and was buried June 22, 1664, in the church of St. Bennet Sherehog,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ballard's Memoirs.</NOTE> under a large mo|numental &s;tone, where &s;everal of her ance&s;tors were before buried. Mr. Aubrey in his manu&s;cript a|bovementioned, ob&s;erves, that her per&s;on was of a middle &s;tature, pretty fat, and ruddy complex|ioned.</P>
<P>Soon after her death, her Poems and Tran&s;lations were collected and publi&s;hed in a volume in folio, to which was added Mon&s;ieur Corneille's Pompey and Horace, Tragedies; with &s;everal other Tran|&s;lations out of French, London 1667, with her picture, a good bu&s;to, before them, &s;tanding on a pede&s;tal, on which is in&s;cribed Orinda; it was printed again at London 1678. In a collection of Letters publi&s;hed by Mr. Thomas Brown, in 1697, are printed four Letters from Mrs. Philips to the Honourable Berenice. Many years after her death, were publi&s;hed a volume of excellent Letters from Mrs. Philips to Sir Charles Cotterel with the en|&s;uing title, Letters from Orinda to Polliarchus, 8vo. London 1705. Major Pack, in his E&s;&s;ay on Study, in&s;erted in his Mi&s;cellanies, gives the following character of the&s;e Letters; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The be&s;t Letters I have met with in our Engli&s;h tongue, are tho&s;e of the celebrated Mrs. Philips to Sir Charles Cotterel; as they are directed all to the &s;ame per&s;on, &s;o they run all in the &s;ame &s;train, and &s;eem to have been employed in the &s;ervice of a refined and generous friend&s;hip.

<P>More te&s;timonies might be produced in favour of Mrs. Philips, but as her works are generally known, and are an indelible te&s;timony of her merit, we reckon it &s;uperfluous. Be&s;ides the poetical abili|ties of the amiable Orinda, &s;he is &s;aid to have been of a generous, charitable di&s;po&s;ition, and a friend to all in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>As few ladies ever lived more happy in her friends than our poete&s;s, &s;o tho&s;e friends have done ju&s;tice to her memory, and celebrated her, when dead, for tho&s;e virtues they admired, when living. Mr. Dryden more than once mentions her with ho|nour, and Mr. Cowley has written an excellent Ode upon her death. As this Ode will better &s;hew the high opinion once entertained of Mrs. Philips, than any thing we can &s;ay, after giving a &s;pecimen of her
<PB N="157" REF="162">
poetry, we &s;hall conclude with this performance of Cowley's, which breathes friend&s;hip in every line, and &s;peaks an hone&s;t mind: &s;o true is the ob&s;ervation of Pope, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that Cowley's works are falling into oblivion,<Q><L>Lo&s;t is his epic, nay, pindaric art,</L>
<L>But &s;till I love the language of his heart.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Philips's poetry has not harmony of ver|&s;ification, or amorous tenderne&s;s to recommend it, but it has a force of thinking, which few poets of the other &s;ex can exceed, and if it is without graces, it has yet a great deal of &s;trength. As &s;he has been celebrated for her friend&s;hip, we &s;hall pre|&s;ent the reader with an Ode upon that &s;ubject, addre&s;&s;ed to her deare&s;t Luca&s;ia.<Q><LG TYPE="ode">

<HEAD>MARGARET, Duche&s;s of NEWCASTLE,</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;econd wife of William Cavendi&s;h, duke of Newca&s;tle, was born at St. John's near Colche&s;ter in E&s;&s;ex, about the latter end of the reign of King James I. and was the younge&s;t daughter of Sir Charles Lucas, a gentleman of great &s;pirit and fortune, who died when &s;he was very young. The duche&s;s her&s;elf in a book in|titled Nature's Pictures, drawn by Fancy's pencil to the life, has celebrated both the exqui&s;ite beauty of her per&s;on, and the rare endowments of her mind. This lady's mother was remarkably a&s;&s;iduous in the education of her children, and be&s;towed upon this, all the in&s;tructions nece&s;&s;ary for forming the minds of young ladies, and introduc|ing them into life with advantage. She found her trouble in cultivating this daughter's mind not in vain, for &s;he di&s;covered early an inclination to learning, and &s;pent &s;o much of her time in &s;tudy and writing, that &s;ome of her Biographers have lamented her not being acquainted with the learn|ed languages, which would have extended her
<PB N="163" REF="168">
knowledge, corrected the exuberances of genius, and have been of infinite &s;ervice to her, in her numerous compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>In the year 1643 &s;he obtained leave of her mo|ther to go to Oxford, where the court then re|&s;ided, and was made one of the Maids of Honour to Henrietta Maria, the Royal Con&s;ort of King Charles I. and when the Queen was forced to leave the arms of her Hu&s;band, and fly into France, by the violence of the prevailing power, this lady attended her there. At Paris &s;he met with the marquis of Newca&s;tle, who&s;e loyalty had like|wi&s;e produced his exile; who, admiring her per&s;on and genius, married her in the year 1645. The marquis had before heard of this lady, for he was a patron and friend of her gallant brother, lord Lucas, who commanded under him in the civil wars. He took occa&s;ion one day to ask his lord&s;hip what he could do for him, as he had his intere&s;t much at heart? to which he an|&s;wered, that he was not &s;ollicitous about his own affairs, for he knew the wor&s;t could be but &s;uffering either death, or exile in the Royal cau&s;e, but his chief &s;ollicitude was for his &s;i&s;ter, on whom he could be&s;tow no fortune, and who&s;e beauty ex|po&s;ed her to danger: he repre&s;ented her amiable qualities, and rai&s;ed the marquis's curio&s;ity to &s;ee her, and from that circum&s;tance aro&s;e the marquis's affection to this lady. From Paris they went to Rotterdam, where they re&s;ided &s;ix months: from thence they returned to Antwerp, where they &s;et|tled, and continued during the time of their exile, as it was the mo&s;t quiet place, and where they could in the greate&s;t peace enjoy their ruined for|tune. She proved a mo&s;t agreeable companion to the marquis, during the gloomy period of exile, and enlivened their rece&s;s, both by her writing and conver&s;ation, as appears by the many compliments and addre&s;&s;es he made her on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="169">
The lady undertook a voyage into England, in order to obtain &s;ome of the marquis's rents, to &s;upply their pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ities, and pay the debts they had been there obliged to contract; and ac|cordingly went with her brother to Gold&s;mith's Hall, where, it &s;eems, the committee of &s;eque&s;tra|tion &s;at, but could not obtain the &s;malle&s;t &s;um out of the marquis's va&s;t inheritance, which, amounted to 20,000 l. per annum; and had it not been for the gene|ro&s;ity and tenderne&s;s of Sir Charles Cavendi&s;h (who greatly reduced his own fortune, to &s;upport his brother in di&s;tre&s;s) they mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed to extreme poverty.</P>
<P>Having rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable &s;um, by the ge|nero&s;ity of her own, and the marquis's, relations, &s;he returned to Antwerp, where &s;he continued with her lord, till the re&s;toration of Charles II, upon which, the marquis, after &s;ix years bani&s;hment, made immediate preparation for his return to his native country, leaving his lady behind him to di&s;patch his affairs there, who, having conducted them to his lord&s;hip's &s;atisfaction, &s;he &s;oon follow|ed her con&s;ort into England. Being now re&s;tored to the &s;un&s;hine of pro&s;perity, &s;he dedicated her time to writing poems, philo&s;ophical di&s;cour&s;es, orations and plays. She was of a generous turn of mind, and kept a great many young ladies a|bout her per&s;on, who occa&s;ionally wrote what &s;he dictated. Some of them &s;lept in a room, conti|guous to that in which her Grace lay, and were rea|dy, at the call of her bell, to ri&s;e any hour of the night, to write down her conceptions, le&s;t they &s;hould e&s;cape her memory.</P>
<P>The young ladies, no doubt, often dreaded her Grace's conceptions, which were frequent, but all of the poetical or philo&s;ophical kind, for though &s;he was very beautiful, &s;he died without i&s;&s;ue: &s;he is &s;aid to have been very re&s;erved and peevi&s;h, perhaps owing to the circum&s;tance ju&s;t mentioned,

<HEAD>WILLIAM CAVENDISH,</HEAD>
<P>BAron Ogle, vi&s;count Mansfield, earl, marquis, and duke of Newca&s;tle, ju&s;tly reckoned one of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed gentlemen, as well as the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed patriot, general, and &s;tate&s;man of his age. He was &s;on of Sir Charles Caven|di&s;h, younge&s;t &s;on of Sir William Cavendi&s;h, and younger brother of the fir&s;t earl of Devon&s;hire, by Katherine daughter of Cuthbert lord Ogle.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Baron. vol. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>He was born in the year 1592, and di&s;cover|ed in his infancy a promptne&s;s of genius, and a love of literature. His father took care to have him in&s;tructed by the be&s;t ma&s;ters in every &s;cience. He no &s;ooner appeared at the court of King James I. than the reputation of his abili|ties drew the attention of that monarch upon him, who made him a knight of the Bath 1610. at the creation of Henry Prince of Wales<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dugdale vol. 2. p. 421.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1617 his father died, who left him a great e&s;tate; and having intere&s;t at court, he was by letters patent, dated Nov. 3, 1620, rai&s;ed to the dignity of a peer of the realm, by the &s;tile and title of baron Ogle, and vi&s;count Mansfield; and having no le&s;s credit with King Charles I. than he had with his father, in the third year of the
<PB N="170" REF="175">
reign of that prince, he was advanced to the higher title of earl of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, and at the &s;ame time he was created baron Caven|di&s;h of Bal&s;over. Our author's attendance upon court, tho' it procured him honour, yet introdu|ced him very early into difficulties; and it ap|pears by Strafford's letters, that he did not &s;tand well with the favourite duke of Buckingham, who was jealous of his growing intere&s;t, and was too penetrating not to di&s;cover, that the quick|ne&s;s of his lord&s;hip's parts would &s;oon &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome methods of ri&s;ing, independent of the fa|vourite, and perhaps &s;haking his influence. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But the&s;e difficulties, &s;ays Clarendon, (for he was deeply plunged in debt) tho' they put him on the thoughts of retirement, never in the lea&s;t prevented him from demon&s;trating his loyalty when the King's cau&s;e demanded it."</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the earl's intere&s;t was not high with the mini&s;ters, yet he found means &s;o to gain and to pre&s;erve the affection of his Maje&s;ty, that in the year 1638, when it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to take the Prince of Wales out of the hands of a woman, his Maje&s;ty appointed the earl his go|vernor, and by entru&s;ting to his tuition the heir apparent of his kingdoms, demon&s;trated the high|e&s;t confidence in his abilities and honour<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the year 1639, the troubles of Scotland breaking out, induced the King to a&s;&s;emble an army in the North, &s;oon after which he went to put him&s;elf at the head of it, and in his way was &s;plendidly entertained by the earl at his &s;eat at Welbeck, as he had been &s;ome years before when he went into Scotland to be crowned, which in it&s;elf, tho' a trivial circum|&s;tance, yet &s;uch was the magnificence of this no|ble

peer, that both the&s;e entertainments found a place in general hi&s;tories, and are computed by the duche&s;s of Newca&s;tle, who wrote the life of her lord, to have amounted to upwards of ten thou&s;and pounds. He invited all the neighbour|ing gentry to pay their compliments to his Ma|je&s;ty, and partake of the fea&s;t, and Ben John&s;on was employed in fitting &s;uch &s;cenes and &s;peeches as he could be&s;t devi&s;e; and Clarendon after men|tioning the &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e entertainments, ob&s;erves, that they had a tendency to corrupt the people, and in&s;pire a wantonne&s;s, which ne|ver fails to prove detrimental to morals.</P>
<P>As &s;uch an expedition as the King's again&s;t the Scots required immen&s;e &s;ums, and the King's trea&s;ury being very empty, his lord&s;hip contribu|ted ten thou&s;and pounds, and rai&s;ed a troop of hor&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of about 200 knights and gen|tlemen, who &s;erved at their own charge, and was honoured with the title of the Prince's troop.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth's collection, vol. 1. p. 929.</NOTE></P>
<P>Tho' the&s;e in&s;tances of loyalty advanced him in the e&s;teem of the King, yet they rather height|ened than dimini&s;hed the re&s;entment of the mi|ni&s;ters, of which the earl of Holland having given a &s;tronger in&s;tance, than his lord&s;hip's patience could bear, he took notice of it in &s;uch a way, as contributed equally to &s;ink his rival's reputa|tion, and rai&s;e his own; and as there is &s;ome|thing curious in the particular manner in which the earl of Holland's character &s;uffered in this quarrel, we &s;hall upon the authority of the du|che&s;s of Newca&s;tle pre&s;ent it to the reader.</P>
<P>The troop which the earl of Newca&s;tle rai&s;ed was &s;tiled the Prince's, but his lord&s;hip command|ed it as captain. When the army drew near Berwick, he &s;ent Sir William Carnaby to the earl

of Holland, then general of the hor&s;e, to know where his troop &s;hould march; his an&s;wer was, next after the troops of the general officers. The earl of Newca&s;tle &s;ent again to repre&s;ent, that having the honour to march with the Prince's colours, he thought it not fit to march under any of the officers of the field; upon which the general of the hor&s;e repeated his orders, and the earl of Newca&s;tle ordered the Prince's colours to be taken off the &s;taff, and marched without any. When the &s;ervice was over, his lord&s;hip &s;ent Mr. Francis Palmer, with a challenge to the earl of Holland, who con&s;ented to a place, and hour of meeting; but when the earl of Newca&s;tle came thither, he found not his antagoni&s;t, but his &s;e|cond. The bu&s;ine&s;s had been di&s;clo&s;ed to the King, by who&s;e authority (&s;ays Clarendon) the matter was compo&s;ed; but before that time, the earl of Holland was never &s;u&s;pected to want cou|rage; and indeed he was rather a cunning, pene|trating, than a brave hone&s;t man, and was re|markably &s;elfi&s;h in his temper.</P>
<P>The earl of Newca&s;tle however found him&s;elf hard pre&s;&s;ed by the mini&s;terial faction, and being un|willing to give his Maje&s;ty any trouble about him&s;elf, he was generous enough to re&s;ign his place as governor to the Prince, and the marquis of Hert|ford was appointed in his room.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip having no more bu&s;ine&s;s at court, and being unwilling to expo&s;e him&s;elf further to the machinations of his enemies, thought proper to retire to the country, where he remained quiet till he received his Maje&s;ty's orders to revi&s;it Hull: Tho' this order came at twelve o'clock at night, yet &s;uch was his un&s;haken loyalty and af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ection, that he went directly, and tho' forty miles di&s;tant, he entered the place with only three or four &s;ervants early the next morning. He offered to his Maje&s;ty, &s;ays Clarendon, to have
<PB N="173" REF="178">
&s;ecured for him that important fortre&s;s, and all the magazines that were in it; but in&s;tead of re|ceiving &s;uch a command, he had in&s;tructions &s;ent him to obey the orders of the Parliament, who &s;u&s;pecting his principles not to be favourable to the &s;chemes of oppo&s;ition then engaged in, cal|led him to attend the &s;ervice of the hou&s;e; and &s;ome di&s;affected members formed a de&s;ign to have attacked him, but his character being unex|ceptionable, their &s;cheme proved abortive, and he had leave to retire again into the country. This he willingly did, as he &s;aw the affairs of &s;tate ha&s;tening to confu&s;ion and his country rea|dy to be &s;teeped in blood, and &s;acrificed to the fu|ry of party. But when the oppo&s;ition ro&s;e high, and it would have been cowardice to have re|mained unactive, he embraced the royal cau&s;e, accepted a commi&s;&s;ion for rai&s;ing men, to take care of the town of Newca&s;tle, and the four ad|joining counties, in which he was to expeditious and &s;ucce&s;sful, that his Maje&s;ty con&s;tituted him general of all the forces rai&s;ed North of Trent; and likewi&s;e general and commander in chief of &s;uch as might be rai&s;ed in the counties of Lin|coln, Nottingham, Che&s;ter, Leice&s;ter, Rutland, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Norfolk, Suffolk, and E&s;&s;ex, with power to confer the honour of knight|hood, coin money, print, and &s;et forth &s;uch de|clarations as &s;hould &s;eem to him expedient: of all which exten&s;ive powers, tho freely conferred, and without re&s;erve, his lord&s;hip made a very &s;paring u&s;e; but with re&s;pect to the more ma|terial point of rai&s;ing men, his lord&s;hip pro&s;ecu|ted it with &s;uch diligence, that in three months he had an army of eight thou&s;and hor&s;e, foot, and dragoons, with which he marched directly into York&s;hire; and his forces having defeated the enemy at Pierce Bridge, his lord&s;hip advanced to York, where Sir Thomas Glenham, the gover|nor,

<P>In the cour&s;e of this civil war, we find the earl of Newca&s;tle very &s;ucce&s;sful in his ma&s;ter's &s;ervice; he more than once defeated Sir Tho|mas Fairfax the general of the Parliament, and won &s;everal important forts and battles; for which his Maje&s;ty in gratitude for his &s;ervices, by let|ters patent, dated the 27th of Oct. 1643, ad|vanced him to the dignity of marqui&s;s of New|ca&s;tle; and in the preamble of his patent, all his &s;ervices (&s;ays Dugdale) are mentioned with &s;uitable encomiums.</P>
<P>In the year 1644, after Prince Rupert had been &s;ucce&s;sful in rai&s;ing the &s;iege of York, and flu&s;hed with the pro&s;perity of his arms, again&s;t the con&s;ent of the marquis, he risked the battle of Mar&s;oon-Moor, in which the marquis's infantry were cut to pieces. Seeing the King's affairs in the&s;e counties totally undone, he made the be&s;t of his way to Scarborough, and from thence with a few of the principal officers of his army took &s;hipping for Hamburgh, and left his e&s;tates, which were valued at upwards of twenty thou&s;and pounds per ann. to be plundered by the Parliament's forces. After &s;taying &s;ix months at Hamburgh, he went by &s;ea to Am&s;terdam, and from thence made a journey to Paris, where he continued for &s;ome time, and where, notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t e&s;tate he had when the civil war broke out, his circum&s;tances were now &s;o bad, that him&s;elf and his young wife, were reduced to pawn their cloaths for &s;u&s;tenance.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Life of the D. of Newca&s;tle, p. 56.</NOTE> He removed afterwards to Antwerp, that he might be nearer his own country; and there, tho' under very great diffi|culties, he re&s;ided for &s;everal years, while the

Notwith&s;tanding the hard&s;hips of an eighteen years bani&s;hment, in which he experienced variety of wretchedne&s;s, he retained his vigour to the la&s;t.

But what comforted him mo&s;t, was the company frequently of his young King, who in the mid&s;t of his &s;ufferings be&s;tow|ed upon him the mo&s;t noble Order of the Gar|ter. The gloomy period at la&s;t came to an end, and the marquis returned to his country with his &s;overeign; and by letters patent dated the 16th of March 1664, he was advanced to the dignity of earl of Ogle, and duke of Newca&s;tle.

<P>WINSTANLEY, in his &s;hort account of this gentleman, &s;ays, that they who are ignorant of his works, mu&s;t plead ignorance of all wit and learning; but the truth is, though he made &s;ome figure in his time, yet it was not &s;o confider|able as to tran&s;mit his name with any lu&s;tre to po|&s;terity, and Win&s;tanley has been too peremptory, in &s;ecluding tho&s;e from wit, who &s;hould be igno|rant of the fame of Birkenhead. This ob&s;ervati|on, however, excited us to a &s;earch after &s;ome par|ticulars concerning him; for Win&s;tanley him&s;elf has given very few, and clo&s;es his life in his u&s;ual way, with only informing the readers that he lived in &s;uch a reign. The be&s;t account we could find of him, is in the Athenae Oxon. of Wood. Our au|thor was &s;on of Randal Birkenhead of Northwich in Che&s;hire, Sadler, and was born there; he be|came a &s;ervitor of Oriel College, under the tuition of Humphrey Lloyd, afterwards lord bi&s;hop of Bangor. He continued in the college till he was made bachelor of arts, and then becoming Ama|nuen&s;is to Dr. Laud, afterwards archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, who, taking a liking to him for his inge|nuity, did, by his diploma make him ma&s;ter of arts, An. 1639, and by his letters commendatory thereupon, he was elected probationer fellow of All-Souls College, in the year following. After the rebe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lion broke out, and the King &s;et up his court at Oxford, our author was appointed to write the Mercurii Aulici, which being very plea&s;|ing to the loyal party, his Maje&s;ty recommended
<PB N="179" REF="184">
him to the electors, that they would chu&s;e him moral philo&s;ophy reader; which being according|ly done, he continued in that office, with little profit from it, till 1648, at which time he was not only turned out thence, but from his fellow|&s;hip, by the Pre&s;byterian vi&s;itors. Afterwards, in this de&s;titute &s;ituation, Wood ob&s;erves, that he re|tired to London, and made &s;hift to live upon his wits; having &s;ome reputation in poetry, he was often applied to by young people in love, to write epi&s;tles for them, and &s;ongs, and &s;onnets on their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es: he was al&s;o employed in tran|&s;lating and writing other little things, &s;o as to pro|cure a tolerable livelihood.</P>
<P>Having, in this manner, &s;upported the gloo|my period of confu&s;ion, he was, at his Maje|&s;ty's re&s;toration, by virtue of his letters, &s;ent to the univer&s;ity, created doctor of the civil law, and in 1661 he was elected a Burge&s;s for Wilton, to &s;erve in that Parliament which began at We&s;tmin&s;ter the 8th of May, the &s;ame year. In 1662, November 14, he received the honour of knighthood, and January 1663 he was con&s;tituted one of the ma&s;ters of reque&s;ts, in the room of Sir Richard Fan&s;haw, when he went am|ba&s;&s;ador into Spain, he being then al&s;o ma&s;ter of the faculties, and a member of the Royal Soci|ety. An anonymous writer tells us, that Sir John Berkenhead was a poor alehou&s;e-keeper's &s;on, and that he ro&s;e by lying, or buffooning at court, to be one of the ma&s;ters of reque&s;ts, and faculty of|fice, and al&s;o got by gifts at court 3000 l. This is a poor reflexion upon him, and indeed rather rai&s;es, than detracts from his reputation, for a man certainly mu&s;t have merit, who can ri&s;e without the advantage of fortune or birth, whereas the&s;e often procure a fool preferment, and make him emi|nent, who might otherwi&s;e have lived and died in ob|&s;curity.
<PB N="180" REF="185">
It is &s;aid of Birkenhead, that when an unmannerly Member of Parliament, in oppo&s;ing him, took occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that he was &s;urprized to hear an alehou&s;e-keeper's &s;on talk &s;o confidently in the Hou&s;e, he coolly replied, I am an alehou&s;e-keeper's &s;on, I own it, and am not a&s;hamed of it, but had the gentleman, who upbraided me with my birth, been thus de&s;cended, in all probability he would have been of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion him|&s;elf; a reply at once, &s;en&s;ible and witty. Mr. Wood, however, &s;eems to be of opinion, that he was too much given to bantering, and that if he had thrown le&s;s of the buffoon or mimic into his conver&s;ation, his wit would have been very agree|able. He is charged by Wood with a higher fail|ing, which ought indeed rather to be con&s;trued one of the blacke&s;t crimes, that is, ingratitude to tho&s;e who a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in di&s;tre&s;s, whom, &s;ays he, he afterwards &s;lighted. This is a heavy charge, and, if true, not a little dimini&s;hes his reputation, but methinks &s;ome apology may even be made for his &s;lighting tho&s;e who a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in di&s;tre&s;s; we find they were &s;uch per&s;ons as could never challenge e&s;teem, young men in love, for whom he wrote &s;onnets, and for whom he might have no friend&s;hip; it often happens, that men of parts are &s;o unhappy as to be obliged to &s;uch people, with whom, were their &s;ituation otherwi&s;e, it would be beneath them to a&s;&s;ociate; and it is no wonder when pro&s;perity returns, that they, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, forget obligations they owed to tho&s;e of a rank &s;o much inferior: and &s;omething mu&s;t be allowed to that pride, which a &s;upe|rior under&s;tanding naturally in&s;pires.</P>

<HEAD>ROGER BOYLE, Earl of ORRERY,</HEAD>
<P>WAS younger brother of Richard earl of Burlington and Cork, and fifth &s;on of Richard, &s;tiled the great earl of Cork. He was born April 25, 1621, and independent of the advan|tage of his birth and titles, was certainly one of the able&s;t politicians, as well as mo&s;t accompli&s;h|ed noblemen of his age. By the influence of his father with lord deputy Faulkland, he was rai&s;ed to the dignity of baron Broghill, in the kingdom of Ireland in 1628, when only &s;even years old<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Earl of Cork's True Remembrance.</NOTE>. He received his education at the college of Dub|lin,
<PB N="183" REF="188">
where he &s;tudied with &s;o much diligence as gave great hopes of his future atchievements, and the rapid progre&s;s he made in erudition, induced his father to &s;end him about 1636 to make the tour of France and Italy, under the care of one Mr. Marcomes, and in the company of lord Ky|nalmeaky, his elder brother; and this method the earl took to perfect all his &s;ons, after they had gone through the cour&s;e of a dome&s;tic education; and it is remarkable, that all his children tra|velled under the &s;ame gentleman's protection, who has no &s;mall honour reflected on him from his illu&s;trious pupils. Upon his return from his tra|vels, he found a war ready to break out again&s;t the Scots, and was pre&s;&s;ed by the earl of Nor|thumberland, the commander in chief of the ex|pedition, to &s;hare in reducing them; but this commotion &s;ub&s;iding, his lord&s;hip employed him|&s;elf another way. By his father's de&s;ire, who loved to &s;ettle his children early in the world, he married lady Margaret Howard, daughter to the earl of Suffolk, and &s;etting out for Ireland, landed there the very day the rebellion broke out, viz. Oct. 23, 1641. The po&s;t a&s;&s;igned him in this time of danger, was the defence of his fa|ther's ca&s;tle of Li&s;more; in which he gave proofs of the mo&s;t gallant &s;pirit, as well as political conduct: The fir&s;t of which he &s;hewed in the vigorous &s;ally he made to the relief of Sir Richard Osborn, who was be&s;ieged in his own hou&s;e by the rebels, till relieved by lord Broghill, who rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and &s;aved him and all his family<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Morrice's Memoirs of E. Orrery, chap. 6.</NOTE>; and a &s;trong proof of the latter, by advi&s;ing Sir William St. Leger, then pre&s;ident of Mun&s;ter, to act vigorou&s;ly again&s;t the Iri&s;h,

notwith&s;tanding they produced the King's com|mi&s;&s;ion, which he was penetrating enough to di&s;cern to be a forgery.</P>
<P>After the ce&s;&s;ation in Ireland, lord Broghill came to Oxford, then the re&s;idence of King Charles I. and paid his duty to that monarch, and was honoured with many private audiences, when he repre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, the tem|per and di&s;po&s;ition of the Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts, and the fal&s;hood of the pretended Committee they had &s;ent over to mi&s;lead his Maje&s;ty, that the King was convinced the Iri&s;h never meant to keep the ce&s;&s;ation, and that therefore it was not the in|tere&s;t of the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects to depend upon it.</P>
<P>Now that we have mentioned the Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts, one thing mu&s;t not be omitted, as it is both curious in it&s;elf, and reflects honour on lord Brog|hill. Many years after the reduction of the&s;e re|bels, his lord&s;hip, who was then earl of Orrery, happened to pay a vi&s;it to the duke of Ormond at Kilkenny, where he met with lord Muskerry, who headed the in&s;urrection, and produced a fal&s;e commi&s;&s;ion for what he did. Finding Muskerry in an open good humour, he took occa&s;ion to retire with him, and to ask him in a plea&s;ant manner, how he came by that commi&s;&s;ion which had &s;o much the appearance of being genuine: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Lord Muskerry an&s;wered, I'll be free, and un|re&s;erved with you, my lord; it was a forged commi&s;&s;ion drawn up by one Wal&s;h, a lawyer, and others; who having a writing to which the Great Seal was affixed, one of the company very dextrou&s;ly took off the &s;ealed wax from the label of that writing, and fixed it to the label of the forged commi&s;&s;ion. Whil&s;t this was doing another accident happened, which &s;tartled all pre&s;ent; and almo&s;t di&s;concerted the &s;cheme. The forged commi&s;&s;ion being fi|ni&s;hed,

while the parchment was handling and turning, in order to put on the &s;eal, a tame wolf which lay a&s;leep by the fire, awakened at the crackling of the parchment, and running to it, &s;eized it, and tore it to pieces, notwith&s;tanding their ha&s;te and &s;truggle to prevent him; &s;o that after all their pains, they were obliged to be|gin a new, and write it all over again<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of the Earl of Orrery. p. 36.</NOTE>.'</Q> Lord Orrery &s;truck with the daring wickedne&s;s of this action, could not help expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to that effect, while Muskerry replied merrily, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have kept the people together without this device.</P>
<P>'Till the death of King Charles I. we find lord Broghill warm in the royal intere&s;t, and that he abhorred tho&s;e mea&s;ures which he fore&s;aw would di&s;tract his country; and as &s;oon as that melancholy event happened, he quitted his e&s;tate <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Carte's Life of the Duke of Ormond.</NOTE> as ruined pa&s;t all hopes, and hid him&s;elf in the privacy of a clo&s;e retirement. How he came afterwards to alter his conduct, and join with a party he be|fore &s;o much abhorred, we &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew.</P>
<P>Upon his lord&s;hip's coming from Ireland, he withdrew to Mar&s;ton in Somer&s;et&s;hire, where he had lei&s;ure to reflect on the ruined &s;tate of the Kingdom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of the Interregnum, p. 133.</NOTE>; and when he revolved in his mind its altered and de&s;perate &s;ituation, he was a&s;hamed to think that he &s;hould remain an idle &s;pectator of his country's mi&s;eries, being of a different opinion from Mr. Addi&s;on: <Q REND="inline">'That when vice pre|vails, and wicked men bear &s;way, the po&s;t of honour is a private &s;tation.'</Q> The&s;e reflexions rou|&s;ed him to action, and produced a &s;cheme wor|thy of him&s;elf. He re&s;olved to attempt &s;ome|thing
<PB N="186" REF="191">
in favour of the King; and accordingly under the pretence of going to the Spa for his health, he determined to cro&s;s the &s;eas, and ap|ply to Charles II. for a commi&s;&s;ion to rai&s;e for|ces in Ireland, in order to re&s;tore his Maje&s;ty, and recover his own e&s;tate. Having formed this re&s;olution, he de&s;ired the earl of Warwick, who had an intere&s;t with the prevailing party, to procure a licence for him to go to the Spa. He communicated his &s;cheme to &s;ome confirmed roy|ali&s;ts, in whom he thought he could confide, and having rais'd a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, he came up to London to pro&s;ecute his voyage. Lord Broghil, however, was betrayed, and the committee, who then took upon them the govern|ment of the realm, threatened him with de&s;truction. Cromwell interceeded, and being &s;en&s;ible of his lord&s;hip's great abilities, obtained a permi&s;&s;ion to talk privately with him before they proceeded to extremities. Cromwell waited upon Broghill, and reproached him gently for his intention, which his lord&s;hip denied; but Cromwell producing let|ters of his writing to &s;everal Royali&s;ts, in whom he confided, he found it was in vain to di&s;|&s;emble any longer. The General then told him, that he was no &s;tranger to his merit, tho' he had never before &s;een him; and that as the reduc|tion of Ireland was intru&s;ted to him, he had au|thority from the Committee to offer his lord&s;hip a command in that war, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his an&s;wer immediately, as the Committee were then &s;itting, and waiting his return. Lord Broghill was infinitely &s;urprized at &s;o generous and un|expected an offer from Cromwell: He thought him&s;elf at liberty, by all the rules of honour to &s;erve again&s;t the Iri&s;h, who&s;e cruelty and rebel|lion were equally dete&s;ted by the royal party, as by the Parliament; and his life and freedom
<PB N="187" REF="192">
being in danger if he refu&s;ed, he accepted the commi&s;&s;ion, and immediately repaired to Bri&s;tol to wait there till forces &s;hould be &s;ent him. This &s;tory we have from Mr. Morrice, who heard it from lord Orrery him&s;elf; and he adds, that it is very probable his lord&s;hip's de&s;ign was betray|ed out of pure love and affection by his &s;i&s;ter Ranelagh, but how this love and affection enabled her to fore&s;ee that Cromwell would interpo&s;e to remove the danger which &s;he expo&s;ed him to, is left by the reverend author unaccounted for. Ever after this interpo&s;ition and friendly offer of Crom|well, we find gratitude binding lord Broghill to a faithfull &s;ervice in his intere&s;t; and in the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try to Cromwell, he prevented many &s;hameful acts of cruelty, which would have been otherwi&s;e perpetrated.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Broghill arrived in Ireland, but his old friends flocked round him, and demon|&s;trated the great heigth of popularity to which he had ri&s;en in that kingdom; nor did his ac|cepting this new commi&s;&s;ion make him negligent of their intere&s;t, for he did all he could for the &s;afety of their per&s;ons and e&s;tates. An opportu|nity &s;oon pre&s;ented in which he very re|markably di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf. He engaged at Macroom (with two thou&s;and hor&s;e and dragoons) a party of Iri&s;h, con&s;i&s;ting of upwards of five thou&s;and, whom he totally defeated, and took their general the titular bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s pri&s;oner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cox's Hi&s;tory of Ireland, vol. 2. part 2d. p. 16.</NOTE>. This battle was fought May 10, 1650. Lord Broghill offered the bi&s;hop his life, if he would order tho&s;e who were in the ca&s;tle of Carigdrog|hid to &s;urrender, which he promi&s;ed; but when he was conducted to the place, he per&s;uaded the garri&s;on to defend it to the la&s;t extremity. Upon
<PB N="188" REF="193">
this lord Broghill cau&s;ed him to be hanged; (tho' Mr. Morrice &s;ays, the &s;oldiers hanged him without orders) and then commanded his heavy artillery to be brought up, which a&s;toni&s;hed his own army exceedingly, they knowing he had not &s;o much as a &s;ingle piece of battering cannon. He cau&s;ed, however, &s;everal large trees to be cut, and drawn at a di&s;tance by his baggage hor&s;es; the be&s;ieged judging by the &s;lowne&s;s of their motion, they were a va&s;t &s;ize, capitulated be|fore they came up, as his lord&s;hip advi&s;ed, threatening otherwi&s;e to give them no quar|ter. He relieved Cromwell at Clonmell, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted both him and his father-in-law Ireton in their expedition; but becau&s;e he could not mode|rate the fury of one, and mitigate the cruelty of the other, he incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of both; and Ireton was heard to &s;ay, that neither he nor Cromwell could be &s;afe while Broghill had any command. Notwith&s;tanding the aver&s;ion of Ireton to his lord&s;hip, yet he took care not to remit any of his diligence in pro&s;ecuting the war, he marched to that general's a&s;&s;i&s;tance at the &s;iege of Lime|rick, and by his conduct and courage was the means of that town's falling into the hands of the Commonwealth; and till Ireland was entirely reduced, he continued active in his commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When Oliver ro&s;e to the dignity of Lord Pro|tector, he &s;ent for lord Broghill, merely to have his advice; and we are told by Oldmixon in his hi&s;tory of the Stewarts, that he then propo&s;ed to Cromwell to marry his daughter to King Charles II. and that as the Prince was then in di&s;tre&s;s abroad, he doubted not but his nece&s;&s;ity would make him comply with the offer; he repre&s;ented to the Protector the great danger to which he was expo&s;ed by the fickle humour of the Engli&s;h,
<PB N="189" REF="194">
who never doat long upon a favourite, but pull that man from eminence to day, whom they had but ye&s;terday rai&s;ed out of the du&s;t; that this match would rivet his intere&s;t, by having the lawful prince &s;o nearly allied to him; and per|haps his grandchild the indi&s;puted heir of the crown. That he might then rule with more &s;afe|ty, nor dread either the violence of the Royali&s;ts, or the in&s;idious enemies of his own government. Upon hearing this, Cromwell made a pau&s;e, and looking &s;tedfa&s;tly in my lord's face, he asked him if he was of opinion, that the exiled prince could ever forgive his father's murderer; he an&s;wered as before, that his nece&s;&s;ity was great, and in or|der to be re&s;tored to his crown, would even &s;a|crifice his natural re&s;entment to his own ea&s;e and grandeur; but Cromwell could not be induced to believe that ever Charles could pardon him.</P>
<P>Whether lord Broghill was &s;erious in this pro|po&s;al cannot be determined; but if he was, it is certain, he had a mean opinion of Charles; to have capitulated upon any terms with Cromwell, would have been betraying the dignity of his birth, and his right to reign; but to have &s;tooped &s;o low, as to take to his arms a child of his, who had murdered his father, and driven him to his exile, would have been an in&s;tance of the mo&s;t infamous meanne&s;s that ever was recorded in hi&s;tory; and all the blemi&s;hes of that lux|urious Prince's character, and the errors of his reign collected, do not amount to any thing &s;o ba&s;e, as would have been tho&s;e nuptials.</P>
<P>In the year 1656 it was propo&s;ed to his lord|&s;hip by the Protector to go down to Scotland, with an ab&s;olute authority, either becau&s;e he &s;u&s;|pected Monk, or was willing to give the people of that country &s;ome &s;atisfaction, who complained
<PB N="190" REF="195">
of his &s;everity; but he was very unwilling to receive the charge, and took it at la&s;t upon the&s;e conditions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thurloe's State Papers.</NOTE>: The fir&s;t was: that he &s;hould be left to him&s;elf, and receive no orders; and the &s;econd, that no complaints &s;hould find cre|dit, or procure directions in his ab&s;ence; and the third, that he &s;hould be recalled in a year. He was very acceptable to the Scotch, and gained a great influence over them by &s;peaking and acting with moderation. After his return, he was with Whitlock and Thurloe admitted into all the confidence that could be expected from a per&s;on in the Protector's circum&s;tances; who if he had any chearful moments, &s;pent them in their company, where he appeared quite another per|&s;on than in the ordinary cour&s;e of his conduct, which was built on a policy &s;uited to his con|dition, the people he had to deal with, and the critical juncture of the times. Our author &s;tood high in Cromwell's favour to the la&s;t; and it was, no doubt, in &s;ome mea&s;ure owing to his gratitude, that he attached him&s;elf &s;o firmly to his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or Richard. It perhaps will appear &s;trange, but it is &s;upported by evidence, that Cromwell did not love his own family &s;o well as lord Broghill did. Being a&s;ked upon his death-bed whom he appointed his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That in &s;uch a clo&s;et his will would be found,"</Q> in which he named Fleetwood, but one of the Protector's daughters getting fir&s;t to the drawer, &s;he took the will and de&s;troyed it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Morrice's Memoirs chap. 5.</NOTE>.</P>

and indu&s;try of Broghill could never &s;o govern his proceedings, but that &s;ome &s;teps either too violent or too remi&s;s were taken, by which his admini&s;tration fell into contempt; and doubtle&s;s the rea&s;on why Cromwell excluded his &s;on, was, that he di&s;covered his weakne&s;s, and found him without a capacity of reigning. When the oppre&s;&s;ion of committees, the general di&s;traction among&s;t the people, and the anarchy into which the Engli&s;h affairs had fallen, began to point towards a re&s;toration, we find lord Broghill declaring early for the King, going over into Ireland, there founding the minds of the officers, and preparing that kingdom for the reception of his Maje&s;ty with open arms.</P>
<P>Thus we have &s;een him di&s;charge with honour the debt of gratitude he owed to Cromwell; but notwith&s;tanding the figure he made in the &s;ervice, it is by no means clear that ever he was warmly attached to the repub|lic; he was detected in having drank the King's health in company with the Protector's children, which Oliver very prudently thought proper to pa&s;s over. After the re&s;toration, Broghill wanted not enemies, who in&s;inuated things again&s;t him to King Charles, and blamed his tardine&s;s in procuring his Maje&s;ty's return; but his lord&s;hip made it clear, that he was the fir&s;t who declar|ed for him in Ireland, and the mo&s;t zealous, as well as the mo&s;t powerful promoter of his intere&s;t. His Maje&s;ty was &s;o well &s;atisfied with his lord&s;hip's proceedings, that he wrote to him with his own hand, and thanked him for his loyalty<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Budgel's Memoirs of the family of the Boyles.</NOTE>. On September 5, 1660, as an incon|te&s;ted proof of his Maje&s;ty's affection for his lord&s;hip, he by letters patent advanced him to the honour of earl of Orrery in the county of
<PB N="192" REF="197">
Cork<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Collin's peerage, vol. iv. p. 26.</NOTE>; and Sir Maurice Eu&s;tace, a friend of the duke of Ormond's, being appointed chancel|lor, Roger earl of Orrery, and Charles Coote, earl of Montrath, were with him made lords ju&s;|tices, about the clo&s;e of that memorable year.</P>
<P>From that time till his death we find lord Orrery in the highe&s;t e&s;teem in the three nati|ons: He was employed by his Maje&s;ty to confer with the earl of Clarendon, who&s;e imperious &s;teps, it &s;eems, had highly di&s;obliged his ma&s;ter, and when that great man fell, the King made an of|fer of the &s;eals to the earl of Orrery, who on account of his want of bodily vigour, declined it. At the &s;ame time he accepted a mo&s;t ardu|ous and unplea&s;ing office from the King, and that was, to expo&s;tulate with the duke of York, and bring him to ask pardon for the haughty and in&s;olent mea&s;ures he took in &s;upporting the chancellor.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty warmly pre&s;&s;ed him to become a favourer of the French alliance, and for the re|duction of the Dutch; neither of which were at all agreeable to his notions, and therefore that he might more conci&s;ely expre&s;s the mi&s;chievous con&s;equences he apprehended from the&s;e mea&s;ures, he reduced his thoughts into a poem; and this was very well received by the King, who thought to have made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on him, in his turn, in a long audience he gave him for that purpo&s;e; but the earl's duty would not permit him to coincide in his opinion with the King, when he was &s;en&s;ible that the King's &s;cheme was contrary to the intere&s;t of the nation; and this led him in plain terms to declare, that he never would concur in coun&s;els to aggrandize France, which was already too great; or to break the power of the Dutch, which was barely &s;ufficient for their own defence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Love's Memoirs of the Earl of Orrery.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="198">
There is a particular circum&s;tance in relation to this affair, which mu&s;t not be omitted. When lord Orrery came from the audience of his Ma|je&s;ty, he was met by the earl of Danby, who asked him, whether he had clo&s;ed with the King's propo&s;als; to which lord Orrery an&s;wered, no. Then replied the other &s;tate&s;man, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your lord|&s;hip may be the hone&s;ter man, but you will never be worth a groat."</Q> This pa&s;&s;age is the more remarkable, becau&s;e Danby was of the &s;ame opinion with Orrery, and temporized purely for the &s;ake of power, which co&s;t him afterwards a long impri&s;onment, and had very near lo&s;t him his life: So dear do &s;uch men often pay for &s;acrificing honour to intere&s;t. In the year 1679, Oct. 16, this great &s;tate&s;man died in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of honours and fame: he had lived in the mo&s;t tumultuous times; he had embarked in a dangerous ocean, and he had the addre&s;s to &s;teer at la&s;t to a &s;afe haven. As a man, his character was very amiable; he was patient, compa&s;&s;ionate, and generous; as a &s;oldier, he was of undaunted courage; as a &s;tate&s;man, of deep penetration, and invincible indu&s;try; and as a poet, of no mean rank.</P>
<P>Before we give an account of his works, it will not be ami&s;s, in order to illu&s;trate the ami|able character of lord Orrery, to &s;hew, that tho' he e&s;pou&s;ed the Protector's intere&s;t, yet he was of &s;ingular &s;ervice to the nation, in re&s;training the violence of his cruelty, and checking the do|mineering &s;pirit of tho&s;e &s;laves in authority, who then called them&s;elves the legi&s;lature.</P>

<HEAD>RICHARD HEAD</HEAD>
<P>WAS the &s;on of a mini&s;ter in Ireland, who being killed in the rebellion there in 1641, among&s;t the many thou&s;ands who &s;uffered in that deplorable ma&s;&s;acre, our author's mother came with her &s;on into England, and he having, &s;ays Win&s;tanley, been trained up in learning, was by the help of &s;ome friends educated at Oxford, in the &s;ame college where his father formerly had been a &s;tudent; but as his circum&s;tances were mean, he was taken away from thence, and bound apprentice to a book&s;eller in London, but his genius being addicted to poetry, before his time was expired, he wrote a piece called Venus Cabinet unlocked; and afterwards he mar|ried and &s;et up for him&s;elf, in which condition he did not long continue, for being addicted to gaming, he ruined his affairs. In this di&s;tre&s;s he went over to Ireland, and compo&s;ed his Hic &amp; Ubique, a noted comedy; and which gained him &s;ome reputation. He then returned to England, reprinted his comedy, and dedicated it to the duke of Monmouth, from whom he received no great encouragement. This circum&s;tance induced him to reflect, that the life of an author was at once the mo&s;t di&s;&s;ipated and unplea&s;ing in the world; that it is in every man's power to injure him, and that few are di&s;po&s;ed to promote him. Ani|mated by the&s;e reflexions, he again took a hou&s;e, and from author re&s;umed his old trade of a book&s;eller, in which, no doubt he judged right; for while an author (be his genius and parts ever
<PB N="200" REF="205">
&s;o bright) is employed in the compo&s;ition of one book, a book&s;eller may publi&s;h twenty; &s;o that in the very nature of things, a book&s;eller with|out oppre&s;&s;ion, a crime which by un&s;ucce&s;sful writers is generally imputed to them, may grow rich, while the mo&s;t indu&s;trious and able au|thor can arrive at no more than a decent com|petence: and even to that, many a great genius has never attained,</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Mr. Head a little recovered him&s;elf, than we find him cheated again by the &s;yren alurements of plea&s;ure and poetry, in the latter of which, however, it does not appear he made any proficiency. He failed a &s;econd time, in the world, and having recour&s;e to his pen, wrote the fir&s;t part of the Engli&s;h Rogue, which being too libertine, could not be licen&s;ed till he had expunged &s;ome of the mo&s;t lu&s;cious de&s;crip|tions out of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Win&s;tanley, p. 208, has informed us, that at the coming out of this fir&s;t part, he was with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> at the Three Cup tavern in Holborn drink|ing a gla&s;s of Rheni&s;h, and made the&s;e ver&s;es upon him,<Q><L>What Gu&s;man, Bu&s;can, Francion, Rablais writ,</L>

<HEAD>THOMAS HOBBS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS celebrated philo&s;opher was &s;on of Tho|mas Hobbs, vicar of We&s;tport, within the Liberty of Malme&s;bury, and of Charlton in Wilts, and was born at We&s;tport on the 5th of April 1588<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wood, ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>.

He had made an extraordinary progre&s;s in the languages before he arrived at his 14th year, when he was &s;ent to Oxford, where he &s;tudied for five years Ari&s;totle's philo&s;ophy. In the year 1607 he took the degree of batchelor of arts, and upon the recommendation of the principal of the college, he entered into the &s;ervice of William Cavendi&s;h, baron Hardwicke, &s;oon afterwards earl of Devon&s;hire<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Athen. Oxon. p. 251.</NOTE>, by whom being much e&s;teemed for his plea&s;antry and humour, he was appointed tutor to his &s;on lord William Cavendi&s;h, &s;everal years younger than Hobbs. Soon after our au|thor travelled with this young nobleman thro' France and Italy, where he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter
<PB N="203" REF="208">
of the different languages of the countries thro' which he travelled; but finding that he had in a great mea&s;ure forgot his Greek and Latin, he dedicated his lei&s;ure hours to the revival of them, and in order to fix the Greek language more firm|ly in his mind, upon his return to England, he &s;et about and accompli&s;hed a tran&s;lation of Thu|cydides, who appeared to him preferable to all other Greek hi&s;torians, and by rendering him into Engli&s;h he meant to &s;hew his countrymen from the Athenian hi&s;tory, the di&s;orders and con|fu&s;ions of a democratical government.</P>
<P>In the year 1628, the earl of Devon&s;hire dy|ing, after our author had &s;erved him 20 years, he travelled again into France with a &s;on of Sir Gervas Clifton; at which time, and during which preregrination (&s;ays Wood) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'he began to make an in&s;pection into the elements of Euclid, and be delighted with his method, not only for the theorems contained in it, but for his art of rea|&s;oning:'</Q> In the&s;e &s;tudies he continued till 1631, when his late pupil the earl of Devon&s;hire cal|led him home in order to undertake the education of his &s;on, then only thirteen years of age, in all the parts of juvenile literature; and as &s;oon as it was proper for him to &s;ee the world, Hobbs again &s;et out for France and Italy, and directed his young pupil to the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps for accompli&s;hing his education.</P>
<P>When our author was at Paris, he began to &s;earch into the fundamentals of natural &s;cience, and con|tracted an intimacy with Marius Mar&s;ennus a Minim, conver&s;ant in that kind of philo&s;ophy, and a man of excellent moral qualities.</P>
<P>In 1637 he was recalled to England, but find|ing the civil war ready to break out, and the Scots in arms again&s;t the King, in&s;tigated by a mean cowardice, he de&s;erted his country in di&s;tre&s;s, and returned to Paris, that he might without interruption pur&s;ue his &s;tudies there, and conver&s;e with men of
<PB N="204" REF="209">
eminence in the &s;ciences. The Parliament prevail|ing. &s;everal of the Royali&s;ts were driven from their own country and were obliged to take &s;helter in France. The Prince of Wales was reduced likewi&s;e to quit the kingdom and live at Paris: Hobbs was employed to teach the young Prince mathematics, in which he made great proficiency; and our author <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed to ob&s;erve. that if the Prince's application was equal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o the quickne&s;s of his parts, he would be the foremo&s;t man in his time in every &s;pecies of &s;cience. All the lei&s;ure hours that Hobbs en|joyed in Paris, he dedicated to the compo&s;ition of a Look called, The Leviathan, a work by which he acquired a great name in Europe; and which was printed at London while he remained at Paris. Under this &s;trange name he means the body politic. The divines of the church of England who attended King Charles II. in France, exclaimed ve|hemently again&s;t this performance, and &s;aid that it contained a great many impious a&s;&s;ertions, and that the author was not of the royal party. Their complaints were regarded, and Hobbs was di&s;|charged the court; and as he had extremely pro|voked the Papi&s;ts, he thought it not &s;afe for him to continue longer in France, e&s;pecially as he was de|prived of the protection of the King of England. He tran&s;lated his Leviathan into Latin, and printed it with an appendix in 1668.</P>
<P>About ten years afterwards, the Leviathan was printed in Low Dutch. The character of this work is drawn as under, by bi&s;hop Burnet. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'His [Hobbs's] main principles were, that all men acted under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, in which he &s;eemed protected by the then received doctrine of ab&s;olute decrees. He &s;eemed to think that the univer&s;e was god, and that &s;ouls were material, Thought being only &s;ubtle and imperceptible moti|on He thought intere&s;t and fear were the chief principles of &s;ociety; and he put all morality in the following that which was our own private will
<PB N="205" REF="210">
or advantage. He thought religion had no other foundation than the laws of the land; and he put all the law in the will of the Prince, or of the peo|ple: For he writ his book at fir&s;t in favour of ab|&s;olute monarchy, but turned it afterwards to gra|tify the Republican party.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Upon his return to England, he lived retired at the &s;eat of the earl of Devon&s;hire, and applied him|&s;elf to the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy; and as almo&s;t all men who have written any thing &s;ucce&s;sfully would be thought poets, &s;o Hobbs laid claim to that character, tho' his poetry is too contemptible for critci&s;m. Dr. White Kennet in his memoirs of the family of Cavendi&s;h informs us, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That while Mr. Hobbs lived in the earl of Devon&s;hire's fami|ly, his profe&s;&s;ed rule was to dedicate the morn|ing to his health, and the afternoon to his &s;tu|dies; and therefore at his fir&s;t ri&s;ing he walked out, and climbed any hill within his reach; or if the weather was not dry, he fatigued him&s;elf within doors, by &s;ome exerci&s;e or other till he was in a &s;weat, recommending that practice up|on his opinion, that an old man had more moi|&s;ture than heat; and therefore by &s;uch motion heat was to be acquired, and moi&s;ture expelled; after this he took a breakfa&s;t, and then went round the lodgings to wait upon the earl, the counte&s;s, and the children, and any con&s;iderable &s;trangers, paying &s;ome &s;hort addre&s;&s;es to them all. He kept the&s;e rounds till about 12 o'clock, when he had a little dinner provided for him, which he eat always by him&s;elf without ceremony. Soon after dinner he retired into his &s;tudy, and had his candle, with ten or twelve pipes of to|bacco laid by him, then &s;hutting the door he fell to &s;moaking and thinking, and writing for &s;eve|ral hours.'</Q></P>
<P>He retained a friend or two at court to protect him if occa&s;ion &s;hould require; and u&s;ed to &s;ay, it was lawful to make u&s;e of evil in&s;truments to do our&s;elves good. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'If I were ca&s;t (&s;aid he) in|to
<PB N="206" REF="211">
a deep pit, and the Devil &s;hould put down his cloven foot, I &s;hould take hold of it to be drawn out by it.'</Q></P>
<P>Towards the end of his life he read very few books, and the earl of Clarendon &s;ays, that he had never read much but thought a great deal; and Hobbs him&s;elf u&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that if he had read as much as other philo&s;ophers, he &s;hould have been as ignorant as they. If any company came to vi&s;it him, he would be free of his di&s;cour&s;e, and behave with plea&s;antry, till he was pre&s;&s;ed, or contradicted, and then he had the infirmities of being &s;hort and peevi&s;h, and referring them to his writings, for bet|ter &s;atisfaction. His friends who had the liberty of introducing &s;trangers to him, made the&s;e terms with them before admi&s;&s;ion, that they &s;hould not di&s;pute with the old man, or contradict him.</P>
<P>In October 1666, when proceedings again&s;t him were depending, with a bill again&s;t athei&s;m and pro|fanene&s;s, he was at Chat&s;worth, and appeared ex|tremely di&s;turbed at the news of it, fearing the me&s;&s;engers would come for him, and the earl of De|von&s;hire would deliver him up, the two hou&s;es of Parliament commit him to the bi&s;hops, and they de|cree him a heretic. This terror upon his &s;pirits greatly di&s;turbed him. He often confe&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e about him, that he meant no harm, was no ob&s;tinate man, and was ready to make any &s;atisfaction; for his prevailing principle and re&s;olution was, to &s;uffer for no cau&s;e whatever.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e apprehen&s;ions of danger, he drew up, in 1680, an hi&s;torical naration of here&s;y, and the puni&s;hments thereof, endeavouring to prove that there was no authority to determine here&s;y, or to puni&s;h it, when he wrote the Leviathan.</P>
<P>Under the &s;ame fears he framed an apology for him&s;elf and his writings; ob&s;erving, that the exceptionable things in his Leviathan were not his opinions, &s;o much as his &s;uppo&s;itions, humbly &s;ub|mited
<PB N="207" REF="212">
to tho&s;e who had the eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, and never &s;ince dogmatically maintained by him either in writing or di&s;cour&s;e; and it is much to be &s;u&s;pected, as Dr. Kennet ob&s;erves, that upon this occa&s;ion, he began to make a more open &s;hew of religion and church communion. He now fre|quented the chapel, joined in the &s;ervice, and was generally a partaker of the &s;acrament; and when any &s;trangers u&s;ed to call in que&s;tion his belief, he always appealed to his conformity in divine &s;ervice, and referred them to the chaplain for a te&s;timony of it. Others thought it a meer compliance with the orders of the family; and ob&s;erved, he never went to any pari&s;h church, and even in the chapel upon &s;undays he went out after prayers, and would not conde&s;cend to hear the &s;ermon, and when any friend a&s;ked the rea&s;on of it, he gave no other an|&s;wer but this, that preachers could tell him nothing but what he knew. He did not conceal his hatred to the clergy; but it was vi&s;ible his aver&s;ion pro|ceeded from the dread of their civil power and in|tere&s;t. He had often a jealou&s;y that the bi&s;hops would burn him; and of all the bench he was mo&s;t afraid of Dr. Seth Ward, bi&s;hop of Sarum, becau&s;e he had mo&s;t offended him. Dr. Kennet further ob&s;erves, that his whole life was governed by his fears.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Parliament of 1640, while it &s;eemed to favour the mea&s;ures of the court, he wrote a little tract in Engli&s;h wherein he demon&s;trated as him&s;elf tells us, that all the power and rights nece&s;&s;ary for the peace of the kingdom, were in|&s;eparably annexed to the &s;overeignty of the King's per&s;on. But in the &s;econd parliament of that year, when they proceeded fiercely again&s;t tho&s;e who had written or preached in defence of the regal power; he was the fir&s;t that fled, went over into France, and there continued eleven years. Whether from
<PB N="208" REF="213">
the dread of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, or as &s;ome have thought<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the notion of gho&s;ts and &s;pirits, is uncertain, but he could not endure to be left in an empty hou&s;e; whenever the earl of Devon&s;hire removed, he would accompany him; even in his la&s;t &s;tage from Chat&s;worth to Hardwick, when in a weak condition, he dared not be left behind, but made his way upon a feather bed in a coach, tho' he &s;ur|vived the journey but a few days. He could not bear any di&s;cour&s;e of death, and &s;eemed to ca&s;t off all thoughts of it; he delighted to reckon upon longer life. The winter before he died he had a warm coat made him, which he &s;aid mu&s;t la&s;t him three years, and then he would have &s;uch another. A few days after his removal to Hardwick, Wood &s;ays that he was &s;truck with a dead pal&s;y, which &s;tupified his right &s;ide from head to foot, depriving him of his &s;peech and rea&s;on at the &s;ame time; but this cir|cum&s;tance is not &s;o probable, &s;ince Dr. Kennet has told us, that in his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s he frequently enquired, whether his di&s;ea&s;e was curable; and when it was told him that he might have ea&s;e but no remedy, he u&s;ed the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I &s;hall be glad then to find a hole to creep out of the world at;'</Q> which are reported to be his la&s;t &s;en&s;ible words, and his lying &s;ome days follow|in a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction, &s;eemed to be owing to his mind, more than to his body. The only thought of death which he appeared to entertain in time of health, was to take care of &s;ome in&s;cription on his grave; he would &s;uffer &s;ome friends to dictate an epitaph, among&s;t which he was be&s;t plea&s;ed with the&s;e words:<Q>" This is the true Philo&s;opher's Stone."</Q></P>
<P>He died at Hardwick, as above-mentioned, on the 4th of Dec. 1679. Notwith&s;tanding his great age,
<PB N="209" REF="214">
for he exceeded 90 at his death, he retained his judgment in great vigour till his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>Some writers of his life maintain, that he had very orthodox notions concerning the nature of God and of all the moral virtues; notwith&s;tanding the general notion of his being a downright athei&s;t; that he was affable, kind, communicative of what he knew, a good friend, a good rela|tion, charitable to the poor, a lover of ju&s;tice, and a de&s;pi&s;er of money. This la&s;t quality is a fa|vourable circum&s;tance in his life, for there is no vice at once more de&s;picable and the &s;ource of more ba&s;e de&s;igns than avarice. His warme&s;t votaries allow, that when he was young he was addicted to the fa|&s;hionable libertini&s;m of wine and women, and that he kept him&s;elf unmarried le&s;t wedlock &s;hould in|terrupt him in the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>In the catalogue of his faults, meanne&s;s of &s;pi|rit and cowardice may be ju&s;tly imputed to him. Whether he was convinced of the truth of his phi|lo&s;ophy, no man can determine; but it is certain, that he had no re&s;olution to &s;upport and maintain his notions: had his doctrines been of ever &s;o much con&s;equence to the world, Hobbs would have abjured them all, rather than have &s;uffered a moment's pain on their account. Such a man may be admired for his invention, and the planning of new &s;y&s;tems, but the world would never have been much illuminated, if all the di&s;coverers of truth, like the philo&s;opher of Malmsbury, had had no &s;pirit to a&s;&s;ert it again&s;t oppo&s;ition. In a piece called the Creed of Mr. Hobbs examined, in a feigned Conference between him and a Student of Divinity, London 1670, written by Dr. Teni&s;on, afterwards archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the Dr. charges Mr. Hobbs with affirming, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that God is a bodily &s;ub&s;tance, though mo&s;t refined, and forceth evil upon the very wills of men; fram|ed a model of government pernicious in its con|&s;equences

The univer&s;ity of Oxford condemned his Leviathan, and his Book de Cive, by a decree pa&s;&s;ed on the 21&s;t of July 1638, and ordered them to be publickly burnt, with &s;everal other treati&s;es excepted again&s;t.</P>

Hobbs &s;eems not to have been very amiable in his life; he was certainly incapable of true friend&s;hip, for the &s;ame cowardice, or fal&s;e principle, which could in&s;ti|gate him to abandon truth, would likewi&s;e teach him to &s;acrifice his friend to his own &s;afety.

books and the &s;tudy of poetry. During the civil wars he &s;uffered much for his religion, which was that of Rome, and the King's cau&s;e; he pretended then to be a baronet, created by King Charles I. after by violence he had been drawn from the Parliament, about June 10, 1641; yet he was not deemed &s;o by the officers of the army, becau&s;e no patent was enrolled to ju&s;tify it, nor any mention of it made in the docquct books belonging to the clerk of the crown in Chancery, where all Pa|tents are taken notice of which pa&s;s the Great Seal. Sir A&s;ton was e&s;teemed by &s;ome a good poet, and was acknowledged by all a great lover of the polite arts; he was addicted to extrava|gance; for he wa&s;ted all he had, which, though he &s;uffered in the civil wars, he was under no nece&s;|&s;ity of doing from any other motive but profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Among&s;t our author's other poetical productions, he has written three plays and a ma&s;que, which are in print, which we &s;hall give in the &s;ame order with Mr. Langbaine.<LIST>

<ITEM>4. Trapolin creduto Principe, or Trapolin &s;up|po&s;ed a Prince, an Italian Tragi-Comedy, printed in 8vo. London 1658.

<P>Sir A&s;ton died at Derby, upon the breaking of the great Fro&s;t in February 1683, and his body being conveyed to Pole&s;worth in Warwick&s;hire be|&s;orementioned, was privately buried there in the chan|cel of the church.

<HEAD>Sir GEORGE WHARTON</HEAD>
<P>WAS de&s;cended of an ancient family in We&s;tmoreland, and born at Kirby-Kendal in that county, the 4th of April 1617, &s;pent &s;ome time at Oxford, and had &s;o &s;trong a propen&s;ity to the &s;tudy of a&s;tronomy and mathematics, that little or no knowledge of logic and phi|lo&s;ophy was acquired by him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wood Athen.

After this, be|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome patrimony, he retired from the univer&s;ity, and indulged his genius, till the breaking out of the civil wars, when he grew impatient of &s;ollitude, and being of very loyal principles turned all his inheritance into mo|ney, and rai&s;ed for his Maje&s;ty a gallant troop of hor&s;e, of which he him&s;elf was captain.</P>

After &s;everal generous hazards of his per&s;on, he was routed, about the 21&s;t of March 1645, near Stow on the Would in Glouce&s;te&s;hire, where Sir Jacob A&s;tley was taken pri&s;oner, and Sir George him&s;elf received &s;everal &s;cars of honour, which he carried to his grave<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Wood, ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>. After this he retired to Oxford the then re&s;idence of the King, and had in recompence of his lo&s;&s;es an employment conferred upon him, under Sir John Heydon, then lieutenant-general of the ordnance, which was to receive and pay off money, for the &s;ervice of the magazine, and artillery; at which time Sir Edward Sherborne was commi&s;&s;ary-ge|neral of it. It was then, that at lei&s;ure hours he followed his &s;tudies, was deemed a member of Queen's-College, being entered among the &s;tu|dents there, and might with other officers have had the degree of ma&s;ter of arts conferred on him by the members of the venerable convocation, but neglected it. After the &s;urrender of the ga|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;on of Oxford, from which time the royal cau&s;e daily declined, our author was reduced to live upon expedients; he came to London, and in or|der to gain a livelihood, he wrote &s;everal little things, which giving offence to tho&s;e in power, he was &s;eized on, and impri&s;oned, fir&s;t in the Gatehou&s;e, then in Newgate, and at length in Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle, at which time, when he expected the &s;evere&s;t &s;troke of an incen|&s;ed party to fall upon him, he found William Lilly, who had formerly been his antagoni&s;t, now his friend, who&s;e humanity and tenderne&s;s, he amply repaid after the re&s;toration. when he was made trea&s;urer and payma&s;ter of his Maje&s;ty's ordnance, and Lilly &s;tood pre&s;cribed as a rebel.

<P>Sir George was e&s;teemed, what in tho&s;e days was called, a good a&s;trologer, and Wood calls him, in his u&s;ual quaint manner, a thorough paced loyali&s;t, a boon companion, and a waggi&s;h poet.

<P>THIS amiable young lady, who has been happy in the prai&s;es of Dryden, was daugh|ter of Dr. Henry Killegrew, ma&s;ter of the Savoy, and one of the prebendaries of We&s;tmin&s;ter. She was born in St. Martin's-Lane in London, a little before the re&s;toration of King Charles II. and was chri&s;tened in a private chamber, the offices of the Common prayer not being then publickly al|lowed. She gave the earlie&s;t di&s;coveries of a great genius, which being improved by the advantage of a polite education, &s;he became eminent in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of poetry and painting, and had her life been prolonged, &s;he might probably have excelled mo&s;t of the pro&s;e&s;&s;ion in both<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ballard's Memoirs of Learned Ladies.</NOTE>.

<P>She was a great proficient in the art of painting, and drew King James II, and his Queen; which pieces are al&s;o highly applauded by Mr. Dryden.

<HEAD>NAT. LEE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS eminent dramatic poet was the &s;on of a clergyman of the church of England, and was educated at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool under Dr. Bu&s;by. After he left this &s;chool, he was &s;ome time at Trinity College, Cambridge; whence returning to London, he went upon the &s;tage as an actor.</P>
<P>Very few particulars are pre&s;erved concerning Mr. Lee. He died before he was 34 years of age, and wrote eleven tragedies, all of which contain the divine enthu&s;ia&s;m of a poet, a noble fire and elevation, and the tender breath|ings of love, beyond many of his cotemporaries. He &s;eems to have been born to write for the Ladies; none ever felt the pa&s;&s;ion of love more intimately, none ever knew to de&s;cribe it more gracefully, and no poet ever moved the brea&s;ts of his audience with &s;tronger palpitations, than Lee. The excellent Mr. Addi&s;on, who&s;e opini|on in a matter of this &s;ort, is of the greate&s;t weight, &s;peaking of the genius of Lee, thus proceeds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spectator. No. 39, vol. 1&s;t.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Among our modern Engli&s;h poets, there is none who was better turned for tragedy than our author; if in&s;tead of favouring the impetuo&s;ity of his genius, he had re&s;trained it, and kep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> it within proper bounds. His thoughts are wonderfully &s;uited for tragedy; but frequently lo&s;t in &s;uch a cloud of words, that it is hard to &s;ee the beauty of them. There is an infi|nite fire in his works, but &s;o involved in &s;moke, that it does not appear in half its lu&s;tre. He
<PB N="228" REF="233">
frequently &s;ucceeds in the pa&s;&s;ionate part of the tragedy; but more particularly where he &s;lackens his efforts, and ea&s;es the &s;tile of tho&s;e epithets and metaphors in which he &s;o much abounds."</Q></P>
<P>It is certain that our author for &s;ome time was deprived of his &s;en&s;es, and was confined in Bed|lam; and as Langbaine ob&s;erves, it is to be re|gretted, that his madne&s;s exceeded that divine fury which Ovid mentions, and which u&s;ually ac|company the be&s;t poets.<Q>E&s;t Deus in nobus agitante cale&s;cimus illo.</Q></P>
<P>His condition in Bedlam was far wor&s;e; in a Satire on the Poets it is thus de&s;cribed.<Q><L>There in a den remov'd from human eyes,</L>
<L>Po&s;&s;e&s;t with mu&s;e, the brain-&s;ick poet lies,</L>
<L>Too mi&s;erably wretched to be nam'd;</L>
<L>For plays, for heroes, and for pa&s;&s;ion fam'd:</L>
<L>Thoughtle&s;s he raves his &s;leeple&s;s hours away</L>
<L>In chains all night, in darkne&s;s all the day.</L>
<L>And if he gets &s;ome intervals from pain,</L>
<L>The fit returns; he foams and bites his chain,</L>
<L>His eye balls roll, and he grows mad again.</L></Q></P>
<P>The reader may plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, the two la&s;t lines are taken from Lee him&s;elf in his de&s;crip|tion of madne&s;s in Cae&s;ar Borgia, which is inimi|table. Dryden has ob&s;erved, that there is a plea&s;ure in being mad, which madmen only know, and indeed Lee has de&s;cribed the condition in &s;uch lively terms, that a man can almo&s;t imagine him|&s;elf in the &s;ituation,<Q><L>To my charm'd ears no more of woman tell,</L>
<L>Name not a woman, and I &s;hall be well:</L>
<L>Like a poor lunatic that makes his moan,</L>
<L>And for a while beguiles his lookers on;</L>
<L><PB N="229" REF="234">
He rea&s;ons well.&mdash;His eyes their wildne&s;s lo&s;e</L>
<L>He vows the keepers his wrong'd &s;en&s;e abu&s;e.</L>
<L>But if you hit the cau&s;e that hurt his brain,</L>
<L>Then his teeth gna&s;h, he foams, he &s;hakes his chain,</L>
<L>His eye-balls roll, and he is mad again.</L></Q></P>
<P>If we may credit the earl of Roche&s;ter, Mr. Lee was addicted to drinking; for in a &s;atire of his, in imitation of Sir John Suckling's Se&s;&s;ion of the Poets, which, like the original, is de&s;titute of wit, poetry, and good manners, he charges him with it.</P>
<P>The lines, mi&s;erable as they are, we &s;hall in|&s;ert;<Q><L>Nat. Lee &s;tept in next, in hopes of a prize;</L>
<L>Apollo remembring he had hit once in thrice:</L>
<L>By the rubies in's face, he could not deny,</L>
<L>But he had as much wit as wine could &s;upply;</L>
<L>Confe&s;s'd that indeed he had a mu&s;ical note,</L>
<L>But &s;ometimes &s;train'd &s;o hard that it rattled in the throat;</L>
<L>Yet own'd he had &s;en&s;e, and t' encourage him for't</L>
<L>He made him his Ovid in A&uacute;gu&s;tus's court.</L></Q></P>
<P>The te&s;timony of Roche&s;ter indeed is of no great value, for he was governed by no principles of ho|nour, and as his ruling pa&s;&s;ion was malice, he was ready on all occa&s;ions to indulge it, at the expence of truth and &s;incerity. We cannot a&s;cer|tain whether our author wrote any of his plays in Bedlam, tho it is not improbable he might have attempted &s;omething that way in his inter|vals.</P>

<P>Lee, for aught we know, might have &s;ome no|ble flights of fancy, even in Bedlam; and it is reported of him, that while he was writing one of his &s;cenes by moon-light, a cloud intervening, he cried out in exta&s;y, <Q REND="inline">"Jove &s;nuff the Moon,"</Q> but as this is only related upon common report, we de&s;ire no more credit may be given to it, than its own nature demands. We do not pretend not|with&s;tanding our high opinion of Lee, to de&s;end all his rants and extravagancies; &s;ome of them are ridiculous, &s;ome bomba&s;t, and others unintelligi|ble; but this ob&s;ervation by no means holds true in general; for tho' &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages are too extra|vagant, yet others are nobly &s;ublime, we had al|mo&s;t &s;aid, unequalled by any other poet.</P>
<P>As there are not many particulars pre&s;erved of Lee's life, we think our&s;elves warranted to enlarge a little upon his works; and therefore we beg leave to introduce to our reader's acquaintance a tragedy which perhaps he has not for &s;ome time heard of, written by this great man, viz. Lucius Junius Brutus, the Father of his country.</P>
<P>We mention this tragedy becau&s;e it is certainly the fine&s;t of Lee's, and perhaps one of the mo&s;t moving plays in our language. Junius Brutus engages in the ju&s;t defence of the injured rights of his country, again&s;t Tarquin the Proud; he &s;uc|ceeds in driving him out of Rome. His &s;on Titus falls in love, and interchanges vows with the tyrant's daughter; his father commands him not to touch her, nor to corre&s;pond with her; he faithfully promi&s;es; but his re&s;olutions are baf|fled by the in&s;inuating and irre&s;i&s;table charms of Teraminta; he is won by her beauties; he joins in the attempt to re&s;tore Tarquin; the enter|prize
<PB N="231" REF="236">
mi&s;carries, and his own father &s;its in judg|ment upon him, and condemns him to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>The interview between the father and &s;on is inexpre&s;&s;ibly moving, and is only exceeded by that between the &s;on and his Teraminta. Titus is a young hero, &s;truggling between love and duty. Teraminta an amiable Roman lady, fond of her hu&s;band, and dutiful to her father.</P>
<P>There are throughout this play, we dare be bold to affirm, as affecting &s;cenes as ever melted the hearts of an audience. Why it is not revived, may be difficult to account for. Shall we charge it to want of ta&s;te in the town, or want of di&s;|cernment in the managers? or are our pre&s;ent actors con&s;cious that they may be unequal to &s;ome of the parts in it? yet were Mr. Quin en|gaged, at either theatre, to do the author ju&s;tice in the character of Brutus, we are not wanting in a Garrick or a Barry, to perform the part of Titus; nor is either &s;tage de&s;titute of a Teraminta. This is one of tho&s;e plays that Mr. Booth pro|po&s;ed to revive (with &s;ome few alterations) had he lived to return to the &s;tage: And the part of Bru|tus was what he purpo&s;ed to have appeared in.</P>
<P>As to Lee's works, they are in every body's hands, &s;o that we need not trouble the reader with a li&s;t of them.</P>
<P>In his tragedy of the Rival Queens, our au|thor has &s;hewn what he could do on the &s;ub|ject of Love; he has there almo&s;t exhau&s;ted the pa&s;&s;ion, painted it in its various forms, and deli|neated the workings of the human &s;oul, when in|fluenced by it.</P>
<P>He makes Statira thus &s;peak of Alexander.<Q><L>Not the &s;pring's mouth, nor breath of Je&s;&s;amin,</L>

<P>His Tragedy of Theodo&s;ius, or the Force of Love, is the only play of Lee's that at pre&s;ent keeps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage, an argument, in my opinion, not much in favour of our ta&s;te, that a Genius &s;hould be &s;o neglected.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that Lee died in the night, in the &s;treets, upon a frolic, and that his father never a&s;|&s;i&s;ted him in his frequent and pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity, which he was able to do. It appears that tho' Lee was a player, yet, for want of execution, he did not much &s;ucceed, though Mr. Cibber &s;ays, that he read excellently, and that the players u&s;ed to tell him, unle&s;s they could act the part as he read it, they could not hope &s;ucce&s;s, which, it &s;eems, was not the ca&s;e with Dryden, who could hardly read to be under&s;tood. Lee was certainly a man of great genius; when it is con&s;idered how young he died, he performed miracles, and had he lived 'till his fervour cooled, and his judgment &s;trengthened, which might have been the con&s;e|quence of years, he would have made a greater figure in poetry than &s;ome of his contemporaries, who are now placed in a &s;uperior rank.</P>

He lived &s;ome time al&s;o with Sir Samuel Luke, a gentleman of a good family in Bedford&s;hire, and a famous com|mander under Oliver Cromwel.</P>
<P>Much about this time he wrote (&s;ays the author of his Life) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the renowned Hudibras; as he then had opportunities of conver&s;ing with the leaders of that party, who&s;e religion he calls hypocri&s;y, who&s;e politics rebellion, and who&s;e &s;peeches non&s;en&s;e;'</Q> he was of an un&s;haken loyalty, though he was placed in the hou&s;e of a rebel, and it is generally thought, that under the character of Hu|dibras, he intended to ridicule Sir Samuel Luke.

duke of Buckingham, when that lord was chancel|lor of the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, and the life writer a&s;&s;ures us he had a great kindne&s;s for him: but the late ingenious major Richard&s;on Pack tells a &s;tory, which, if true, overthrows both their a&s;|&s;ertions, and as it is &s;omewhat particular, we &s;hall give it a place here. Mr. Wycherley had taken every opportunity to repre&s;ent to his grace the duke of Buckingham, how well Mr. Butler had de&s;erved of the Royal Family, by writing his inimitable Hudibras, and that it was a reproach to the court, that a per&s;on of his loyalty and wit &s;hould langui&s;h in ob&s;curity, under &s;o many wants. The duke &s;eemed always to hearken to him with attention, and, after &s;ome time, undertook to re|commend his preten&s;ions to his Maje&s;ty. Mr. Wycherly, in hopes to keep him &s;teady to his word, obtained of his Grace to name a day, when he might introduce that mode&s;t, unfortunate poet to his new patron; at la&s;t an appointment was made, Mr. Butler and his friend attended accord|ingly, the duke joined them. But, as the devil would have it (&s;ays the major) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the door of the room, where he &s;at, was open, and his Grace, who had &s;eated him&s;elf near it, ob&s;erving a pimp of his acquaintance (the creature too was a knight) trip by with a brace of ladies, imme|diately quitted his engagement to follow ano|ther kind of bu&s;ine&s;s, at which he was more ready, than at doing good offices to men of de|&s;ert, though no one was better qualified than he, both in regard to his fortune, and under|&s;tanding to protect them, and from that hour to the day of his death, poor Butler never found the lea&s;t effect of his promi&s;e, and de&s;cended to the grave oppre&s;&s;ed with want and poverty.'</Q></P>

Mr. Butler in &s;hort, affords a remarkable in&s;tance of that coldne&s;s and neglect, which great genius's often experience from the court and age in which they live; we are told indeed by a gentleman, who&s;e father was intimate with Butler, Charles Longue|ville, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> that Charles II. once gave him a gratuity of three hundred pounds, which had this compliment attending it, that it pa&s;&s;ed all the offices without any fee, lord Danby being at that time high trea&s;urer, which &s;eems to be the only court favour he ever received; a &s;trange in&s;tance of neglect! when we con&s;ider King Charles was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive fond of this poem of Hudibras; that he carried it always in his pocket, he quoted it almo&s;t on every occa&s;ion, and never mentioned it, but with raptures.</P>
<P>This is movingly repre&s;ented in a poem of our author's, publi&s;hed in his remains called Hudibras at Court. He takes occa&s;ion to ju&s;tify his poem, by hinting its excellences in general, and paying a few mode&s;t compliments to him&s;elf, of which we &s;hall tran&s;cribe the following lines.<Q><L>Now you mu&s;t know, &s;ir Hudibras,</L>

<P>The poem entitled Hudibras, by which he ac|quired &s;o high a reputation, was publi&s;hed at three different times; the fir&s;t part came out in 1668 in 8vo. afterwards came out the &s;econd part, and both were printed together, with &s;everal additions, and annotations; at la&s;t, the third and la&s;t part was publi&s;hed, but without any annotations, as ap|pears by the printed copy 1678. The great &s;uc|ce&s;s and peculiarity of manner of this poem has produced many un&s;ucce&s;sful imitations of it, and &s;ome vain attempts have been made to tran&s;late &s;ome parts of it into Latin. Mon&s;ieur Voltaire gives it a very good character, and ju&s;tly ob|&s;erves, that though there are as many thoughts as words in it, yet it cannot be &s;ucce&s;sfully tran&s;lated, on account of every line's having &s;ome allu&s;ion to Engli&s;h affairs, which no foreigner can be &s;up|po&s;ed to under&s;tand, or enter into.

<HEAD>EDMUND WALLER <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>WAS de&s;cended of a family of his name in Buckingham&s;hire, a younger branch of the Wallers of Kent. He was born March 3, 1605 at Cole&s;hill, which gives Warwick&s;hire the ho|nour of his birth. His father dying when he was very young, the care of his education fell to his mother, who &s;ent him to Eton &s;chool, according to the author of his life, but Mr. Wood &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that he was mo&s;tly educated in grammaticals un|der one Dob&s;on, mini&s;ter of Great Wycombe in Bucks, who had been educated in Eton &s;chool,'</Q> without mentioning that Mr. Waller had been at all at Eton &s;chool: after he had acquired gram|mar learning, he was removed to King's college in Cambridge, and it is manife&s;t that he mu&s;t have been extremely a&s;&s;iduous in his &s;tudies, &s;ince he acquired &s;o fine a ta&s;te of the ancients, in &s;o &s;hort a time, for at &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years of age, he was cho&s;en into the la&s;t Parliament of King James I. and &s;erved as Burge&s;s for Agmon|de&s;ham.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="246">
In the year 1623, when Prince Charles nearly e&s;caped being ca&s;t away in the road of St. Andre, coming from Spain, Mr. Waller wrote a Poem on that occa&s;ion, at an age when, generally &s;peak|ing, per&s;ons of the acute&s;t parts ju&s;t begin to &s;hew them&s;elves, and at a time when the Engli&s;h poetry had &s;carce any grace in it. In the year 1628 he addre&s;&s;ed a Poem to his Maje&s;ty, on his hearing the news of the duke of Buckingham's death, which, with the former, procured him general ad|miration: harmony of numbers being at that time &s;o great a novelty, and Mr. Waller having, at once, &s;o poli&s;hed and refined ver&s;ification, it is no wonder that he enjoyed the felicity of an univer|&s;al applau&s;e. The&s;e poems recommended him to court-favour, and rendered him dear to per|&s;ons of the be&s;t ta&s;te and di&s;tinction that then flouri&s;hed. A Writer of his life ob&s;erves, as a proof of his being much care&s;&s;ed by people of the fir&s;t reputation, that he was one of the famous club, of which the great lord Falkland, Sir Francis Wain|man, Mr. Chillingworth, Mr. Godolphin, and o|ther eminent men were members. The&s;e were the immortals of that age, and to be a&s;&s;ociated with them, is one of the highe&s;t encomiums which can po&s;&s;ibly be be&s;towed, and exceeds the mo&s;t laboured &s;train of a panegyri&s;t.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance related of this club, is pret|ty remarkable: One evening, when they were con|vened, a great noi&s;e was heard in the &s;treet, which not a little alarmed them, and upon enquiring the cau&s;e, they were told, that a &s;on of Ben John&s;on's was arre&s;ted. This club was too generous to &s;uffer the child of one, who was the genuine &s;on of Apollo, to be carried to a Jail, perhaps for a trifle: they &s;ent for him, but in place of being Ben John|&s;on's &s;on, he proved to be Mr. George Morley, afterwards bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter. Mr. Waller liked him &s;o well, that he paid the debt, which
<PB N="242" REF="247">
was no le&s;s than one hundred pounds, on condition that he would live with him at Beconsfield, which he did eight or ten years together, and from him Mr. Waller u&s;ed to &s;ay, that he learned a ta&s;te of the ancient poets, and got what he had of their manner. But it is evident from his poems, written before this incident of Mr. Morley's ar|re&s;t, that he had early acquired that exqui&s;ite Spirit: however, he might have improved it afterwards, by the conver&s;ation and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Morley, to whom this adventure proved very advantageous.</P>
<P>It is uncertain, at what time our author was mar|ried, but, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that his fir&s;t wife Anne, daughter and heir of Edward Banks, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> was dead before he fell in love with lady Dorothy Sidney, daughter to the earl of Leice&s;ter, whom he celebrates under the name of Sachari&s;&s;a. Mr. Waller's pa&s;|&s;ion for this lady, has been the &s;ubject of much conver&s;ation; his ver&s;es, addre&s;ied to her, have been renowned for their delicacy, and Sachari&s;&s;a has been propo&s;ed, as a model to &s;ucceeding poets, in the celebration of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.

the court, had the more credit and intere&s;t to promote the &s;ervice of it. When the ruptures grew &s;o great between the King, and the two hou&s;es, that many of the Members withdrew from tho&s;e councils, he, among the re&s;t, ab&s;ent|ed him&s;elf, but at the time the &s;tandard was &s;et up, having intimacy and friend&s;hip with &s;ome per&s;ons now of nearne&s;s about the King, with his Maje&s;ty's leave he returned again to London, where he &s;poke, upon all occa&s;ions, with great &s;harpne&s;s and freedom; which was not re&s;trained, and therefore u&s;ed as an argu|ment again&s;t tho&s;e who were gone upon pre|tence, that they were not &s;uffered to declare their opinion freely in the Hou&s;e; which could not be believed, when all men knew what li|berty Mr. Waller took, and &s;poke every day with impunity, again&s;t the proceedings of the Hou&s;e; this won him a great reputation with all people who wi&s;hed well to the King; and he was looked upon as the bolde&s;t champion the crown had in either Hou&s;e, &s;o that &s;uch Lords and Commons who were willing to pre|vent the ruin of the kingdom, complied in a great familiarity with him, as a-man re&s;olute in their ends, and be&s;t able to promote them; and it may be, they believed his reputation at court &s;o good, that he would be no ill evidence there of other men's zeal and affection; &s;o all men &s;poke their minds freely to him, both of the general di&s;temper, and of the pa&s;&s;ions and ambition of particular per&s;ons, all men know|ing him to be of too good a fortune, and too wary a nature, to engage him&s;elf in de&s;igns of hazard.'</Q></P>

city, and conver&s;ed much with tho&s;e who di&s;liked the proceedings of the Parliament, from whom he learned the di&s;po&s;itions of the citizens on all accidents, which he freely communicated to his brother Waller, as the latter imparted to him whatever ob&s;ervations he made from tho&s;e with whom he conver&s;ed. Mr. Waller told him, that many lords and commons were for a peace. Mr. Tomkins made the &s;ame relation with re|&s;pect to the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial men of London, which Mr. Waller reported to the well affected members of both hou&s;es; and Mr. Tomkins to the well affected citizens; whence they came to a conclu&s;ion, that if they heartily united in the mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one another, they &s;hould be able to prevent tho&s;e tumults which &s;eemed to countenance the di&s;tractions, and both parties would be excited to moderation. The lord Con|way at that time coming from Ireland incen&s;ed again&s;t the Scotch, di&s;contented with the Par|liament here, and finding Waller in good e|&s;teem with the earl of Norhumberland, and in great friend&s;hip with the earl of Portland, entered into the &s;ame familiarity; and being a &s;oldier, in the di&s;cour&s;es they had, he in&s;inuated, it was convenient to enquire into the numbers of the well affected in the city, that they might know whom they had to tru&s;t to. Mr. Waller telling Mr. Tomkins this, the latter imparted it to his confidents there; and it was agreed, that &s;ome tru&s;ty per&s;ons in every ward and pari&s;h about London &s;hould make a li&s;t of all the inhabitants, and by gue&s;&s;ing at their &s;everal affections, com|pute the &s;trength of that party which oppo&s;ed an accommodation, and that which was for it.</P>

Hereupon a committee was appointed to examine all per|&s;ons they thought fit, and to apprehend &s;ome nominated at that time; and the &s;ame night this committee apprehended Mr. Waller and Mr. Tomkins, and the next day &s;uch as they &s;u&s;pec|ted.'</P></Q></P>

And there cannot be a greater evidence of the ine&s;timable value of his parts, than that he lived in the good affection and e&s;teem of many, the pity of mo&s;t, and the reproach and &s;corn of few, or none.'</Q></P>
<P>After this &s;torm had &s;ub&s;ided, Mr. Waller travel|led into France, where he continued &s;everal years.

<P>All men have honoured him as the great re|finer of Engli&s;h poetry, who re&s;tored numbers to the delicacy they had lo&s;t; and joined to meli|fluent cadence the charms of &s;en&s;e. But as Mr. Waller is unexceptionally the fir&s;t who brought in a new turn of ver&s;e, and gave to rhime all the graces of which it was capable, it would be injurious to his fame, not to pre&s;ent the reader with the opinions of &s;ome of the greate&s;t men concerning him, by which he will be be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ter able to under&s;tand his particular excellencies, and will &s;ee his beauties in full glow before him. To begin with Mr. Dryden, who, in his dedication to the Rival Ladies, addre&s;&s;ed to the earl of Orrery, thus characterizes Waller. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'The excellency and dignity of rhime were never fully known till Mr. Waller &s;ought it: He fir&s;t made writing ea&s;ily an art; fir&s;t &s;hewed us to conclude the &s;en&s;e mo&s;t commonly in di&s;tichs, which in the ver&s;es of tho&s;e before him, runs on for &s;o many lines together, that the reader is out of breath to overtake it.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Voltaire, in his letters concerning the Engli&s;h nation, &s;peaking of Briti&s;h poets, thus mentions Waller. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Our author was much talked of in France. He had much the &s;ame reputation in London that Voiture had in Paris; and in my opinion de&s;erved it better. Voiture was born in an age that was ju&s;t emerging from barba|rity; an age that was &s;till rude and ignorant; the people of which aimed at wit, tho' they had not the lea&s;t preten&s;ions to it, and &s;ought for points and conceits in&s;tead of &s;entiments. Bri&s;tol &s;tones are more ea&s;ily found than dia|monds. Voiture born with an ea&s;y and frivo|lous genius, was the fir&s;t who &s;hone in this Aurora of French literature. Had he come into
<PB N="256" REF="261">
the world after tho&s;e great genius's, who &s;pread &s;uch glory over the age of Lewis XIV, he would either have been unknown, would have been de&s;pi&s;ed, or would have corrected his &s;tile. Wal|ler tho' better than Voiture, was not yet a fi|ni&s;hed poet. The graces breathe in &s;uch of Wal|ler's works as are wrote in a tender &s;train; but then they are languid thro' negligence, and often disfigured with fal&s;e thoughts. The Eng|li&s;h had not at this time attained the art of correct writing; but his &s;erious compo&s;itions exhibit a &s;trength and vigour, which could not have been expected from the &s;oftne&s;s and effe|minacy of his other pieces.'</Q></P>
<P>The anonymous author of the preface to the &s;econd part of our author's poems, printed in the year 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">90, has given his character at large, and tells us; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That Waller is a name that carries every thing in it that is either great, or grace|ful in poetry. He was indeed the parent of Engli&s;h ver&s;e, and the fir&s;t who &s;hewed us our tongue had beauty and numbers in it. The tongue came into his hands like a rough dia|mond; he poli&s;hed it fir&s;t, and to that degree, that arti&s;ts &s;ince have admired the workman&s;hip without pretending to mend it. He undoubt|edly &s;tands fir&s;t in the li&s;t of refiners; and for ought I know the la&s;t too; for I que&s;tion whe|ther in Charles II's reign; the Engli&s;h did not come to its full perfection, and whether it had not had its Augu&s;tan age, as well as the La|tin.'</Q> Thus far this anonymous author. If I may be permitted to give my opinion in &s;o delicate a point as the reputation of Waller, I &s;hall take the liberty to ob&s;erve, that had he, in place of preceding, &s;ucceeded tho&s;e great wits who flouri&s;hed in the reign of Charles II, he could never have ro&s;e to &s;uch great reputation,
<PB N="257" REF="262">
nor would have de&s;erved it: No &s;mall honour is due to him for the harmony which he introduced, but upon that chiefly does his reputation &s;tand. He certainly is &s;ometimes languid; he was ra|ther a tender than a violent lover; he has not that force of thinking, that amazing reach of genius for which Dryden is renowned, and had it been his lot to have appeared in the reign of Queen Anne, I imagine, he would not have been ranked above the &s;econd cla&s;s of poets. But be this as it may, poetry owes him the highe&s;t ob|ligations for refining it, and every &s;ucceeding genius will be ready to acknowledge, that by co|pying Waller's &s;trains, they have improved their own, and the more they follow him, the more they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Waller altered the Maid's Tragedy from Fletcher, and tran&s;lated the fir&s;t Act of the Tragedy of Pompey from the French of Corneille. Mrs. Katharine Philips, in a letter to Sir Charles Cotterell, a&s;cribes the tran&s;lation of the fir&s;t act to our author; and ob&s;erves, that Sir Edward Fil|mer did one, Sir Charles Sidley another, lord Buck|hur&s;t another; but who the fifth, &s;ays &s;he, I cannot learn.</P>
<P>Mrs. Philips then proceeds to give a critici&s;m on this performance of Waller's, &s;hews &s;ome faults, and points out &s;ome beauties, with a &s;pirit and can|dour peculiar to her.</P>

<HEAD>JOHN OGILBY,</HEAD>
<P>THIS poet, who was likewi&s;e an eminent Geographer and Co&s;mographer, was born near Edinburgh in the year 1600<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Athen. Oxon. vol. ii. p. 378.</NOTE>. His father, who was of an ancient and genteel family, having &s;pent his e&s;tate, and being pri&s;oner in the King's Bench for debt, could give his &s;on but little educati|on at &s;chool; but our author, who, in his early years di&s;covered the mo&s;t invincible indu&s;try, obtained a little knowledge in the Latin grammar, and afterwards &s;o much money, as not only to procure his father's di&s;charge from pri&s;on, but al&s;o to bind him&s;elf apprentice to Mr. Draper a dancing ma&s;ter in Hol|bourn, London. Soon after, by his dexterity in his profe&s;&s;ion, and his complai&s;ant behaviour to his ma&s;ter's employers, he obtained the favour of them to lend him as much money as to buy out the remaining part of his time, and &s;et up for him|&s;elf; but being afterwards appointed to dance in the duke of Buckingham's great Ma&s;que, by a fal&s;e &s;tep, he &s;trained a vein in the in&s;ide of his leg, which ever after occa&s;ioned him to halt. He afterwards taught dancing to the &s;i&s;ters of Sir Ralph Hopton, at Wytham in Somer&s;et&s;hire, where, at lei&s;ure, he learned to handle the pike and mu&s;ket. When Thomas earl of Strafford became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, he was retained in his family to teach the art of dancing, and be|ing
<PB N="266" REF="271">
an excellent penman, he was frequently em|ployed by the earl to tran&s;cribe papers for him.</P>
<P>In his lord&s;hip's family it was that he fir&s;t gave proofs of his inclination to poetry, by tran&s;lating &s;ome of Ae&s;op's Fables into Engli&s;h ver&s;e, which he com|municated to &s;ome learned men, who under&s;tood Latin better than he, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance and ad|vice he publi&s;hed them. He was one of the troop of guards belonging to the earl, and compo&s;ed an humourous piece entitled the Character of a Trooper. About the time he was &s;upported by his lord&s;hip, he was made ma&s;ter of the revels for the kingdom of Ireland, and built a little theatre for the repre&s;entation of dramatic entertainments, in St. Warburgh's &s;treet in Dublin: but upon the breaking out of the rebellion in that kingdom, he was &s;e|veral times in great danger of his life, particular|ly when he narrowly e&s;caped being blown up in the ca&s;tle of Rath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">am. About the time of the conclu&s;ion of the war in England, he left Ireland, and being &s;nipwrecked, came to London in a very nece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">tous condition. After he had made a &s;hort &s;tay in the metropolis, he travelled on foot to Cambridge, where his great indu&s;try, and love of learning, recommended him to the no|tice of &s;everal &s;cholars, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he became &s;o compleat a ma&s;ter of the Latin tongue, that in 1646 he publi&s;hed an Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of Virgil, which was printed in large 8vo. and dedi|cated to William marquis of Hereford. He re|printed it at London 1654 in fol. with this title; The Works of Publius Virgilius Maro, tran&s;lated and adorned with Sculptures, and illu&s;trated with Annotations; which, Mr. Wood tells us, was the faire&s;t edition, that till then, the Engli&s;h pre&s;s ever produced. About the year 1654 our indefatiga|ble author learned the Greek language, and in four years time publi&s;hed in fol. a tran&s;lation of Homer's Iliad, adorned with excellent &s;culptures, illu&s;trated
<PB N="267" REF="272">
with Annotations, and addre&s;&s;ed to King Charles II. The &s;ame year he publi&s;hed the Bible in a large fol. at Cambridge, according to the tran&s;lation fet forth by the &s;pecial command of King James I. with the Liturgy and Articles of the Church of England, with Chorographical Sculptures. About the year 1662 he went into Ireland, then having obtained a patent to be made ma&s;ter of the revels there, a place which Sir William Davenant &s;ollicited in vain. Upon this oc|ca&s;ion he built a theatre at Dublin, which co&s;t him 2000 l. the former being ruined during the troubles. In 1664 he publi&s;hed in London, in fol. a tran&s;lation of Homer's Ody&s;&s;ey, with Sculptures, and Notes. He afterwards wrote two heroic poems, one entitled the Ephe&s;ian Matron, the other the Ro|man Slave, both dedicated to Thomas earl of O&s;|&s;ory. The next work he compo&s;ed was an Epic Poem in 12 Books, in honour of King Charles I. but this was entirely lo&s;t in the fire of London in September 1666, when Mr. Ogilby's hou&s;e in White Fryars was burnt down, and his whole for|tune, except to the value of five pounds, de&s;troy|ed. But misfortunes &s;eldom had any irretrievable con&s;equences to Ogilby, for by his in&s;inuating ad|dre&s;s, and mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing indu&s;try, he was &s;oon able to repair whatever lo&s;s he &s;u&s;tained by any cro&s;s accident. It was not lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> till he fell on a method of rai&s;ing a fre&s;h &s;um of money. Pro|curing his hou&s;e to be rebuilt, he &s;et up a print|ing-office, was appointed his Maje&s;ty's Co&s;mogra|pher and Geographic Printer, and printed many great works tran&s;lated and collected by him&s;elf and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, the enumeration of which would be unnece&s;&s;ary and tedious.</P>
<P>This laborious man died September 4, 1676, and was interred in the vault under part of the church in St. Bride's in Fleet-&s;treet. Mr. Edward Philips in

his Theatrum Poetarum &s;tiles him one of the prodi|gies, from producing, after &s;o late an initiation into literature, &s;o many large and learned volumes, as well in ver&s;e as in pro&s;e, and tells us, that his Paraphra&s;e upon Ae&s;op's Fables, is generally con|fe&s;&s;ed to have exceeded whatever hath been done before in that kind.</P>
<P>As to our author's poetry, we have the authority of Mr. Pope to pronounce it below critici&s;m, at lea&s;t his tran&s;lations; and in all probability his ori|ginal epic poems which we have never &s;een, are not much &s;uperior to his tran&s;lations of Homer and Vir|gil. If Ogilby had not a poetical genius, he was not|with&s;tanding a man of parts, and made an amazing proficiency in literature, by the force of an unwea|ried application. He cannot be &s;ufficiently com|mended for his virtuous indu&s;try, as well as his fi|lial piety, in procuring, in &s;o early a time of life, his father's liberty, when he was confined in a pri|&s;on.</P>
<P>Ogilby &s;eems indeed to have been a good &s;ort of man, and to have recommended him&s;elf to the world by hone&s;t means, without having recour&s;e to the &s;er|vile arts of flattery, and the blandi&s;hments of fal&s;hood. He is an in&s;tance of the a&s;toni&s;hing efficacy of ap|plication; had &s;ome more modern poets been ble&s;&s;ed with a thou&s;andth part of his oeconomy and indu|&s;try, they needed not to have lived in poverty, and died or want. Although Ogilby cannot be deno|mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ated a genius, yet he found means to make a genteel livelihood by literature, which many of the &s;ons of Parna&s;&s;us, ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uperior powers, cur&s;e as a very dry and unplea&s;ing &s;oil, but which proceeds more from want of culture, than native barrenne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>WILMOT, Earl of ROCHESTER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an ob&s;ervation founded on experience, that the poets have, of all other men, been mo&s;t addicted to the gratifications of appetite, and have pur&s;ued plea&s;ure with more unwearied ap|plication than men of other characters. In this re|&s;pect they are indeed unhappy, and have ever been more &s;ubject to pity than envy. A violent love of plea&s;ure, if it does not de&s;troy, yet, in a great mea&s;ure, enervates all other good qualities with which a man may be endowed; and as no men have ever enjoyed higher parts from nature, than the poets, &s;o few, from this unhappy attachment to plea&s;ure, have effected &s;o little good by tho&s;e amazing powers. Of the truth of this ob&s;ervati|on, the nobleman, who&s;e memoirs we are now to pre&s;ent to the reader, is a &s;trong and indeli|ble in&s;tance, for few ever had more ability, and more frequent opportunities, for promoting the in|tere&s;ts of &s;ociety, and none ever pro&s;tituted the gifts of Heaven to a more inglorious purpo&s;e. Lord Roche&s;ter was not more remarkable for the &s;uperiority of his parts, than the extraordinary debauchery of his life, and with his di&s;&s;ipations of plea&s;ure, he &s;uffered &s;ometimes malevolent prin|ciples to govern him, and was equally odious for malice and envy, as for the boundle&s;s gratifications of his appetites.</P>
<P>This is, no doubt, the character of his lord|&s;hip, confirmed by all who have tran&s;mitted any
<PB N="270" REF="275">
account of him: but if his life was &s;upremely wicked, his death was exemplarily pious; before he approached to the conclu&s;ion of his days, he &s;aw the follies of his former plea&s;ures, he liv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d to re|pent with the &s;evere&s;t con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ition, and charity obliges all men to believe that he was as &s;incere in his prote&s;tations of penitence, as he had been before in libertine indulgence.

<P>Lord Roche&s;ter was &s;on of the gallant Hen|ry lord Wilmot, who engaged with great zeal in the &s;ervice of King Charles I. during the civil wars, and was &s;o much in favour with Charles II. that he entru&s;ted his per&s;on to him, after the un|fortunate battle of Worce&s;ter, which tru&s;t he di&s;|charged with &s;o much fidelity and addre&s;s, that the young King was conveyed out of England into France, chiefly by his care, application and vigilance. The mother of our author was of the ancient family of the St. Johns in Wilt&s;hire, and has been celebrated both for her beauty and parts.</P>
<P>In the year 1648, di&s;tingui&s;hed to po&s;terity, by the fall of Charles I. who &s;uffered on a &s;caffold erected before the window of his own palace, our author was born at Dichley, near Wood&s;tock, in the &s;ame county, the &s;cene of many of his plea&s;ures, and of his death. His lord&s;hip's father had the misfortune to reap none of the rewards of &s;uffering loyalty, for he died in 1660, immedi|ately before the re&s;toration, leaving his &s;on as the
<PB N="271" REF="276">
principal part of his inheritance, his titles, ho|nours, and the merit of tho&s;e extraordinary &s;ervices he had done the crown; but though lord Wilmot left his &s;on but a &s;mall e&s;tate, yet he did not &s;uf|fer in his education by the&s;e means, for the oeco|nomy, of his mother &s;upplied that de&s;iciency, and he was educated &s;uitable to his quality. When he was at &s;chool (it is agreed by all his biographers) he gave early in&s;tances of a readine&s;s of wit; and tho&s;e &s;hining parts which have &s;ince appeared with &s;o much lu&s;tre, began then to &s;hew them&s;elves: he acquired the Latin to &s;uch per|fection, that, to his dying day, he retained a great reli&s;h for the ma&s;culine firmne&s;s, as well as more elegant beauties of that language, and was, &s;ays Dr. Burnet, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'exactly ver&s;ed in tho&s;e authors who were the ornaments of the court of Augu&s;tus, which he read often with the peculiar delight which the greate&s;t wits have often found in tho&s;e &s;tudies.'</Q> When he went to the univer&s;ity, the general joy which over-ran the nation upon his Maje&s;ty's return, amounted to &s;omething like di|&s;traction, and &s;oon &s;pread a very malignant influ|ence through all ranks of life. His lord&s;hip ta&s;ted the plea&s;ures of libertini&s;m, which then broke out in a full tide, with too acute a reli&s;h, and was almo&s;t overwhelmed in the aby&s;s of wan|tonne&s;s. His tutor was Dr. Elandford, afterwards promoted to the &s;ees of Oxford and Worce&s;ter, and under his in&s;pection he was committed to the more immediate care of Phinehas Berry, fellow of Wadham College, a man of learning and pro|bity, whom his lord&s;hip afterwards treated with much re&s;pect, and rewarded as became a great man; but notwith&s;tanding the care of his tutor, he had &s;o deeply engaged in the di&s;&s;ipations of the general jubilee, that he could not be prevailed up|on to renew his &s;tudies, which were totally lo&s;t in

the joys more agreeable to his inclination. He never thought of re&s;uming again the pur&s;uit of knowledge, 'till the fine addre&s;s of his go vernor, Dr. Balfour, won him in his travels, by degrees, to tho&s;e charms of &s;tudy, which he had through youthful levity for&s;aken, and being &s;e|conded by rea&s;on, now more &s;trong, and a more mature ta&s;te of the plea&s;ure of learning, which the Dr. took care to place in the mo&s;t agreeable and advantageous light, he became enamoured of knowledge, in the pur&s;uit of which he often &s;pent tho&s;e hours he &s;ometimes &s;tole from the witty, and the fair.

During the action, Sir Edward Spragge not being &s;atisfied with the be|haviour of one of the captains, could not ea&s;ily find a per&s;on that would undertake to venture through &s;o much danger to carry his command to the captain; this lord offered him&s;elf to the &s;ervice, and went in a little boat, through all the &s;hot, and delivered his me&s;&s;age, and return|ed back to Sir Edward, which was much com|mended by all that &s;aw it.'</Q> The&s;e are the early in&s;tances of courage, which can be produced in favour of lord Roche&s;ter, which was afterwards impeached, and very ju&s;tly, for in many private broils, he di&s;covered a timid pu&s;illanimous &s;pirit, very un&s;uitable to tho&s;e noble in&s;tances of the con|trary, which have ju&s;t been mentioned.</P>

di&s;covered in private broils, particularly in the affair between him and the earl of Mulgrave, in which he behaved very meanly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Life of Sheffield Duke of Buckingham.</NOTE>. The cou|ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e which lord Roche&s;ter &s;hewed in a naval en|gagement, was in the early part of his life, be|fore he had been immer&s;ed in tho&s;e labyrinths of exce&s;s and luxury, into which he afterwards &s;unk. It is certainly a true ob&s;ervation, that guilt makes cowards; a man who is continually &s;ubjected to the reproaches of con&s;cience, who is afraid to examine his heart, left it &s;hould appear too hor|rible, cannot have much courage: for while he is con&s;cious of &s;o many errors to be repented of, of &s;o many vices he has committed, he naturally &s;tarts at danger, and &s;lies from it as his greate&s;t enemy. It is true, courage is &s;ometimes con&s;ti|tutional, and there have been in&s;tances of men, guilty of every en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rmity, who have di&s;covered a large &s;hare of it, but the&s;e have been wrerches who have overcome all &s;en&s;e of honour, been lo&s;t to every con&s;ideration of virtue, and who&s;e courage is like that of the lion of the de&s;art, a kind of fe|rocious impul&s;e unconnected with rea&s;on. Lord Roche&s;ter had certainly never overcome the re|proaches of his con&s;cience, who&s;e alarming voice at la&s;t &s;truck terror into his heart, and chilled the fire of the &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Since his travels, and naval expeditions, he &s;eemed to have contracted a habit of temperance, in which had he been &s;o happy as to per&s;evere, he mu&s;t have e&s;caped that fatal r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ck, on which he afterwards &s;plit, upon his return to court, where love and plea&s;ure kept their perpetual rounds, under the &s;miles of a prince, whom nature had fitted for all the enjoy|ments of the mo&s;t luxurious de&s;ires. In times &s;o di&s;|&s;olute as the&s;e, it is no wonder if a man of &s;o warm a con&s;titution as Roche&s;ter, could not re&s;i&s;t the
<PB N="275" REF="280">
too flattering temptations, which were heightened by the participation of the court in general.

His plea&s;ant extrava|gancies &s;oon became the &s;ubject of general conver|&s;ation, by which his vanity was at once flattered, and his turn of &s;atire rendered more keen, by the &s;ucce&s;s it met with.</P>
<P>Roche&s;ter had certainly a true talent for &s;atire, and he &s;pared neither friends nor foes, but let it loo&s;e on all without di&s;crimination. Maje&s;ty it&s;elf was not &s;ecure from it; he more than once lampooned the King, who&s;e weakne&s;s and attachment to &s;ome of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, he endeavoured to cure by &s;everal means, that is, either by winning them from him, in &s;pite of the indulgence and liberality they felt from a royal gallant, or by &s;everely lampooning them and him on various occa&s;ions; which the King, who was a man of wit and plea&s;ure, as well as his lord&s;hip, took for the natural &s;allies of his genius, and meant rather as the amu&s;ements of his fancy, than as the efforts of malice; yet, ei|ther by a too frequent repetition, or a too clo&s;e and poignant virulence, the King bani&s;hed him the court for a &s;atire made directly on him; this &s;atire con&s;i&s;ts of 28 &s;tanzas, and is entitled The Re&s;tora|tion, or the Hi&s;tory of the In&s;ipids; and as it con|tains the keene&s;t re&s;lexions again&s;t the political conduct, and private character of that Prince, and having produced the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;hment of this noble lord, we &s;hall here give it a place, by which his lord&s;hip's genius for this kind of writing will ap|pear.<Q><PB N="276" REF="281"><LG TYPE="satire">

<P>Much about this time the duke of Buckingham was under di&s;grace, for things of another na|ture, and being di&s;engaged from any particular attachment in town, he and lord Roche&s;ter re&s;olved, like Don Quixote of old, to &s;et out in que&s;t of ad|ventures; and they met with &s;ome that will appear entertaining to our readers, which we &s;hall give up|on the authority of the author of Roche&s;ter's Life, prefixed to his works. Among many other adven|tures the following was one:</P>
<P>There happened to be an inn on New-market road to be lett, they di&s;gui&s;ed them&s;elves in pro|per habits for the per&s;ons they were to a&s;&s;ume, and jointly took this inn, in which each in his turn officiated as ma&s;ter; but they &s;oon made this &s;ub&s;ervient to purpo&s;es of another nature.</P>
<P>Having carefully ob&s;erved the pretty girls in the country with whom they were mo&s;t captivated, (they con&s;idered not whether maids, wives, or widows) and to gain opportunities of &s;educing them, they invited the neighbours, who had either wives or daughters, to frequent fea&s;ts, where the men were plied hard with good liquor, and the women &s;ufficiently warm|ed to make but as little re&s;i&s;tance as would be agree|able to their inclinations, dealing out their poi&s;on to both &s;exes, in&s;piring the men with wine, and o|ther
<PB N="283" REF="288">
&s;trong liquors, and the women with love; thus they were able to deflower many a virgin, and alienate the affections of many a wife by this odd &s;tratagem; and it is difficult to &s;ay, whether it is po&s;&s;ible for two men to live to a wor&s;e purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is natural to imagine that this kind of life could not be of long duration. Fea&s;ts &s;o fre|quently given, and that without any thing to pay, mu&s;t give a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion that the inn-keepers mu&s;t &s;oon break, or that they were of &s;uch for|tune and circum&s;tances, as did not well &s;uit the po&s;t they were in.&mdash;This their lord&s;hips were &s;en&s;i|ble of, but not much concerned about it, &s;ince they were &s;eldom found long to continue in the &s;ame &s;ort of adventures, variety being the life of their enjoyments. It was be&s;ides, near the time of his Maje&s;ty's going to Newmarket, when they de|&s;igned, that the di&s;covery of their real plots, &s;hould clear them of the imputation of being concerned in any more pernicious to the government. The&s;e two conjectures meeting, they thought them&s;elves obliged to di&s;patch two important adventures, which they had not yet been able to compa&s;s.&mdash;There was an old cove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ous mi&s;er in the neighbourhood, who not|with&s;tanding his age, was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very agreeable young wife. Her hu&s;band watched her with the &s;ame a&s;&s;iduity he did his money, and never tru&s;ted her out of his &s;ight, but under the protection of an old maiden &s;i&s;ter, who never had her&s;elf experienced the joys of love, and bore no great benevolence to all who were young and hand&s;ome. Our noble inn-keepers had no man|ner of doubt of his accepting a treat, as many had done, for he loved good living with all his heart, when it co&s;t him nothing; and except upon the&s;e occa&s;ions he was the mo&s;t temperate and ab&s;temious man alive; but then they could never prevail with him to bring his wife, not|notwith&s;tandlng
<PB N="284" REF="289">
they urged the pre&s;ence of &s;o many good wives in the neighbourhood to keep her company. All their &s;tudy was then how to deceive the old &s;i&s;ter at home, who was &s;et as a guardian over that fruit which the mi&s;er could neither eat him&s;elf, nor &s;uffer any other to ta&s;te; but &s;uch a difficulty as this was &s;oon to be overcome by &s;uch inventions. It was therefore agreed that lord Roche&s;ter &s;hould be dre&s;&s;ed in woman's cloaths, and while the hu&s;band was fea&s;ting with my lord duke, he &s;hould make trial of his &s;kill with the old woman at home. He had learned that &s;he had no aver&s;ion to the bottle when &s;he could come &s;ecretly and conve|niently at it. Equipped like a country la&s;s, and furni&s;hed with a bottle of &s;piritous liquors, he marched to the old mi&s;er's hou&s;e. It was with difficulty he found means to &s;peak with the old woman, but at la&s;t obtained the favour; where perfect in all the cant of tho&s;e people, he began to tell the occa&s;ion of his coming, in hopes &s;he would invite him to come in, but all in vain; he was admitted no further that the porch, with the hou&s;e door a-jar: At la&s;t, my lord finding no other way, fell upon this expedient. He pretend|ed to be taken &s;uddenly ill, and tumbled down upon the thre&s;hold. This noi&s;e brings the young wife to them, who with much trouble per&s;uades her keeper to help her into the hou&s;e, in regard to the decorum of her &s;ex, and the unhappy condi|tion &s;he was in. The door had not been long &s;hut, till our impo&s;tor by degrees recovers, and being &s;et on a chair, cants a very religious thank&s;giving to the good gentlewoman for her kindne&s;s, and ob&s;erved how deplorable it was to be &s;ubject to &s;uch fits, which often took her in the &s;treet, and expo&s;ed her to many accidents, but every now and then took a &s;ip of the bottle, and recom|mended it to the old benefactre&s;s, who was &s;ure
<PB N="285" REF="290">
to drink a hearty dram. His lord&s;hip had ano|ther bottle in his pocket qualified with a O|pium, which would &s;ooner accompli&s;h his de|&s;ire, by giving the woman a &s;omniferous do&s;e, which drinking with greedine&s;s, &s;he &s;oon fell fa&s;t a&s;leep.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip having &s;o far &s;ucceeded, and being fired with the pre&s;ence of the young wife, for whom he had formed this odd &s;cheme, his de&s;ires be|came impetuous, which produced a change of co|lour, and made the artle&s;s creature imagine the fit was returning. My lord then asked if &s;he would be &s;o charitable as to let him lie down on the bed; the good-natured young woman &s;hewed him the way, and being laid down, and &s;taying by him at his reque&s;t, he put her in mind of her condition, asking about her hu&s;band, whom the young woman painted in his true colours, as a &s;urly, jealous old tyrant. The rural innocent imagining &s;he had only a woman with her, was le&s;s re&s;erved in her behaviour and expre&s;&s;ions on that account, and his lord&s;hip &s;oon found that a tale of love would not be unplea&s;ing to her. Being now no longer able to curb his appetite, which was wound up beyond the power of re&s;traint, he declared his &s;ex to her, and without much &s;truggling enjoyed her.</P>
<P>He now became as happy as indulgence could make him; and when the fir&s;t tran&s;ports were over, he contrived the e&s;cape of this young adul|tre&s;s from the pri&s;on of her keeper. She heark|ened to his propo&s;als with plea&s;ure, and before the old gentlewoman was awake, &s;he robbed her hu&s;band of an hundred and fifty pieces, and marched off with lord Roche&s;ter to the inn, a|bout midnight.</P>
<P>They were to pa&s;s over three or four fields be|fore they could reach it, and in going over the la&s;t, they very nearly e&s;caped falling into the ene|my's
<PB N="286" REF="291">
hands; but the voice of the hu&s;band di&s;co|vering who he was, our adventurers &s;truck down the field out of the path, and &s;or the greater &s;ecurity lay down in the gra&s;s. The place, the occa&s;ion, and the per&s;on that was &s;o near, put his lord&s;hip in mind of renewing his plea&s;ure al|mo&s;t in &s;ight of the cuckold. The fair was no longer coy, and ea&s;ily yielded to his de&s;ires. He in &s;hort carried the girl home, and then pro&s;tituted her to the duke's plea&s;ure, after he had been cloyed him&s;elf. The old man go|ing home, and finding his &s;i&s;ter a&s;leep, his wife fled, and his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ney gone, was thrown into a &s;tate of madne&s;s, and &s;oon hanged him&s;elf. The news was &s;oon &s;pread about the neighbourhood, and reached the inn, where both lovers, now as weary of their purcha&s;e as de&s;irous of it before, advi&s;ed her to go to London, with which &s;he complied, and in all probability followed there the trade of pro&s;titution for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The King, &s;oon after this infamous ad|venture, coming that way, found them both in their po&s;ts at the inn, took them again into fa|vour, and &s;uffered them to go with him to New|market. This exploit of lord Roche&s;ter is not at all improbable, when his character is con&s;ider|ed; His treachery in the affair of the mi&s;er's wife is very like him; and &s;urely it was one of the greate&s;t acts of ba&s;ene&s;s of which he was ever guilty; he artfully &s;educed her, while her un&s;u&s;|pecting hu&s;band was entertained by the duke of Buckingham; he contrived a robbery, and pro|duced the death of the injured hu&s;band; this com|plicated crime was one of tho&s;e heavy charges on his mind when he lay on his death-bed, under the dreadful alarms of his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip's amours at court made a great noi&s;e in the world of gallantry, e&s;pecially that which he had with the celebrated Mrs. Roberts, mi|&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="287" REF="292">
to the King, whom &s;he abondoned for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Roche&s;ter's heart, which &s;he found to her experience, it was not in her power long to hold. The earl, who was &s;oon cloyed with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any one woman, tho' the faire&s;t in the world, for&s;ook her. The lady after the fir&s;t indignation of her pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ided, grew as indifferent, and con&s;idered upon the proper means of retrieving the King's affections. The occa&s;ion was luckily given her one morning while &s;he was dre&s;ling: &s;he &s;aw the King coming by, &s;he hurried down with her hair di&s;heveled, threw her&s;elf at his feet, implored his pardon, and vowed con&s;tancy for the future. The King, overcome with the well-di&s;&s;embled agonies of this beauty, rai&s;ed her up, took her in his arms, and prote&s;ted no man could &s;ee her, and not love her: he waited on her to her lodging, and there compleated the re|conciliation. This ea&s;y behaviour of the King, had, with many other in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind, determined my lord Hallifax to a&s;&s;ert, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the love of King Charles II, lay as much as any man's in the lower regions; that he was indifferent as to their con&s;tancy, and only valued them for the &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure they could yield."</Q></P>
<P>Lord Roche&s;ter's frolics in the character of a mountebank are well known, and the &s;peech which he made upon the occa&s;ion of his fir&s;t turning itinerant doctor, has been often printed; there is in it a true &s;pirit of &s;atire, and a keenne&s;s of lampoon, which is very much in the character of his lord&s;hip, who had certainly an original turn for invective and &s;atirical compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>We &s;hall give the following &s;hort extract from this celebrated &s;peech, in which his lord&s;hip's wit appears pretty con&s;picuous.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes"><PB N="288" REF="293"><P>"If I appear (&s;ays Alexander Bendo) to any one like a counterfeit, even for the &s;ake of that chiefly ought I to be con&s;trued a true man, who is the counterfeit's example, his original, and that which he employs his indu&s;try and pains to imitate and copy. Is it therefore my fault if the cheat, by his wit and endeavours, makes him&s;elf &s;o like me, that con&s;equently I cannot avoid re&s;embling him? Con&s;ider, pray, the valiant and the coward, the wealthy mer|chant and the bankrupt; the politician and the fool; they are the &s;ame in many things, and differ but in one alone. The valiant man holds up his hand, looks confidently round a|bout him, wears a &s;word, courts a lord's wife, and owns it; &s;o does the coward. One only point of honour, and that's courage, which (like fal&s;e metal, one only trial can di&s;cover) makes the di&s;tinction. The bankrupt walks the ex|change, buys bargains, draws bills, and ac|cepts them with the riche&s;t, whil&s;t paper and credit are current coin; that which makes the difference is real ca&s;h, a great defect indeed, and yet but one, and that the la&s;t found out, and &s;till till then the lea&s;t perceived.&mdash;Now for the politician; he is a grave, diliberating, clo&s;e, prying man: Pray are there not grave, deliberating, clo&s;e, prying fools? If therefore the difference betwixt all the&s;e (tho' infinite in effect) be &s;o nice in all appearance, will you yet expect it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e between the fal&s;e phy&s;ician, a&s;trologer, &amp;c. and the true? The fir&s;t calls him&s;elf learned doctor, &s;ends forth his bills, gives phy&s;ic and council, tells, and foretells; the other is bound to do ju&s;t as much. It is only your experience mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt them, to which I willingly &s;ubmit my&s;elf."</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="294">
When lord Roche&s;ter was re&s;tored again to the favour of King Charles II, he continued the &s;ame extravagant pur&s;uits of plea&s;ure, and would even u&s;e freedoms with that Prince, whom he had before &s;o much offended; for his &s;atire knew no bounds, his invention was lively, and his ex|ecution &s;harp.</P>
<P>He is &s;uppo&s;ed to have contrived with one of Charles's mi&s;tre&s;'s the following &s;tratagem to cure that monarch of the nocturnal rambles to which he addicted him&s;elf. He agreed to go out one night with him to vi&s;it a celebrated hou&s;e of in|trigue, where he told his Maje&s;ty the fine&s;t wo|men in England were to be found. The King made no &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ume his u&s;ual di&s;gui&s;e and accompany him, and while he was engaged with one of the ladies of plea&s;ure, being before in&s;tructed by Roche&s;ter how to behave, &s;he pick'd his pocket of all his money and watch, which the king did not immediately mi&s;s. Neither the people of the hou&s;e, nor the girl her&s;elf was made acquainted with the quality of their vi&s;iter, nor had the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion who he was. When the intrigue was ended, the King enquired for Ro|che&s;ter, but was told he had quitted the hou&s;e, without taking leave: But into what embara&s;&s;|ment was he thrown when upon &s;earching his pockets, in order to di&s;charge the reckoning, he found his money gone; he was then reduced to ask the favour of the Jezebel to give him credit till to morrow, as the gentleman who came in with him had not returned, who was to have pay'd for both. The con&s;equence of this reque&s;t was, he was abu&s;ed, and laughed at; and the old woman told him, that &s;he had often been &s;erved &s;uch dirty tricks, and would not permit him to &s;tir till the reckoning was paid, and then called one of her bullies to take care of him. In this
<PB N="290" REF="295">
ridiculous di&s;tre&s;s &s;tood the Briti&s;h monarch; the pri&s;oner of a bawd, and the life upon whom the nation's hopes were fixed, put in the power of a ruffian. After many altercations the King at la&s;t propo&s;ed, that &s;he &s;hould accept a ring which he then took off his finger, in pledge for her money, which &s;he likewi&s;e refu&s;ed, and told him, that as &s;he was no judge of the value of the ring, &s;he did not chu&s;e to accept &s;uch pledges. The King then de&s;ired that a Jeweller might be called to give his opinion of the value of it, but he was an&s;wered, that the expedient was impracticable, as no jeweller could then be &s;up|po&s;ed to be out of bed. After much entreaty his Maje&s;ty at la&s;t prevailed upon the &s;ellow, to knock up a jeweller and &s;hew him the ring, which as &s;oon as he had in&s;pected, he &s;tood amazed, and enquired, with eyes fixed upon the fellow, who he had got in his hou&s;e? to which he an|&s;wered, a black-looking ugly &s;on of a w&mdash;, who had no money in his pocket, and was ob|liged to pawn his ring. The ring, &s;ays the jew|cller, is &s;o immen&s;ely rich, that but one man in the nation could afford to wear it; and that one is the King. The jeweller being a&s;toni&s;hed at this accident, went out with the bully, in or|der to be fully &s;atisfied of &s;o extraordinary an affair; and as &s;oon as he entered the room, he &s;ell on his knees, and with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect pre&s;ented the ring to his Maje&s;ty. The old Je|zebel and the bully &s;inding the extraordinary quality of their gue&s;t, were now confounded, and a&s;ked pardon mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively on their knees. The King in the be&s;t natured manner forgave than, and laughing, asked them, whether the ring would not bear another bottle.</P>
<P>Thus ended this adventure, in which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> learned how dangerous it was to risk <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> per&s;on in night-f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">olics; and could not

but &s;everely reprove Roche&s;ter for acting &s;uch a part towards him; however he &s;incerely refolved never again to be guilty of the like indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the mo&s;t material of the adventures, and libertine cour&s;es of the lord Roche&s;ter, which hi&s;torians and biographers have tran&s;mitted to po|&s;terity; we &s;hall now con&s;ider him as an author.</P>
<P>He &s;eems to have been too &s;trongly tinctured with that vice which belongs more to literary people, than to any other profe&s;&s;ion under the &s;un, viz. envy. That lord Roche&s;ter was en|vious, and jealous of the reputation of other men of eminence, appears abundantly clear from his behaviour to Dryden, which could proceed from no other principle; as his ma|lice towards him had never di&s;covered it&s;elf till the tragedies of that great poet met with &s;uch general applau&s;e, and his poems were univer|&s;ally e&s;teemed. Such was the inveteracy he &s;hewed to Mr. Dryden, that he &s;et up John Crown, an ob&s;cure man, in oppo&s;ition to him, and recommended him to the King to compo&s;e a ma&s;que for the court, which was really the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the poet laureat; but when Crown's Con|que&s;t of Jeru&s;alem met with as extravagant &s;uc|ce&s;s as Dryden's Almanzor's, his lord&s;hip then withdrew his favour from Crown, as if he would be &s;till in contradiction to the public. His ma|lice to Dryden is &s;aid to have &s;till further di&s;|covered it&s;elf, in hiring ruffians to cudgel him for a &s;atire he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the author of, which was at once malicious, cowardly, and cruel: But of this we &s;hall give a fuller account in the life of Mr. Dryden.</P>

which other writers, and common tradition, di&s;|po&s;e us to form of him. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'He was a wonderful man, &s;ays he, whether we con&s;ider the con&s;tant good &s;en&s;e, and agree|able mirth of his ordinary conver&s;ation, or the va&s;t reach and compa&s;s of his inventions, and the amazing depth of his retired thoughts; the un|common graces of his fa&s;hion, or the inimitable turns of his wit, the becoming gentlene&s;s, the be|witching &s;oftne&s;s of his civility, or the force and fitne&s;s of his &s;atire; for as he was both the delight, the love, and the dotage of the women, &s;o was he a continued curb to impertinence, and the public cen&s;ure of folly; never did man &s;tay in his com|pany unentertained, or leave it unin&s;tructed; ne|ver was his under&s;tanding bia&s;&s;ed, or his plea&s;ant|ne&s;s forced; never did he laugh in the wrong place, or pro&s;titute his &s;en&s;e to &s;erve his luxury; never did he &s;tab into the wounds of fallen vir|tue, with a ba&s;e and a cowardly in&s;ult, or &s;mooth the face of pro&s;perous villany, with the paint and wa&s;hes of a mercenary wit; never did he &s;pare a fop for being rich, or flatter a knave for being great. He had a wit that was accompanied with an unaffected greatne&s;s of mind, and a na|tural love to ju&s;tice and truth; a wit that was in perpetual war with knavery, and ever at|tacking tho&s;e kind of vices mo&s;t, who&s;e malig|nity was like to be the mo&s;t diffu&s;ive, &s;uch as tended more immediately to the prejudice of public bodies, and were a common nu&s;ance to the happine&s;s of human kind. Never was his pen drawn but on the &s;ide of good &s;en&s;e, and u&s;ually employed like the arms of the ancient heroes, to &s;top the progre&s;s of arbitrary op|pre&s;&s;ion, and beat down the bruti&s;hne&s;s of head-&s;trong
<PB N="293" REF="298">
will: to do his King and country ju&s;|tice, upon &s;uch public &s;tate thieves as would beggar a kingdom to enrich them&s;elves: the&s;e were the vermin whom to his eternal honour his pen was continually pricking and goading; a pen, if not &s;o happy in the &s;ucce&s;s, yet as generous in the aim, as either the &s;word of The&s;eus, or the club of Hercules; nor was it le&s;s &s;harp than that, or le&s;s weighty than this. If he did not take &s;o much care of him&s;elf as he ought, he had the humanity however, to wi&s;h well to others; and I think I may truly af|firm he did the world as much good by a right application of &s;atire, as he hurt him&s;elf by a wrong pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure.'</P></Q></P>
<P>In this amiable light has Mr. Wol&s;ely drawn our author, and nothing is more certain, than that it is a portraiture of the imagination, warmed with gratitude, or friend&s;hip, and bears but little or no re&s;emblance to that of Roche&s;ter,; can he who&s;e &s;atire is always levelled at parti|cular per&s;ons, be &s;aid to be the terror of knaves, and the public &s;oe of vice, when he him&s;elf has acknowledged that he &s;atirized only to gratify his re&s;entment; for it was his opinion, that writ|ing &s;atires without being in a rage, was like kil|ling in cold blood. Was his conver&s;ation in&s;truc|tive who&s;e mouth was full of ob&s;cenity; and was he a friend to his country, who diffu&s;ed a dange|rous venom thro' his works to corrupt its members? in which, it is to be feared he has been but too &s;ucce&s;s|ful. Did he never &s;mooth the face of pro&s;perous vil|lainy, as Mr. Wol&s;ely expre&s;&s;es it, the &s;cope of who&s;e life was to promote and encourage the mo&s;t licentious debauchery, and to unhinge all the principles of honour?&mdash;Either Mr. Wol&s;ely mu&s;t be &s;trangely mi&s;taken? or all other writers who have given us
<PB N="294" REF="299">
accounts of Roche&s;ter mu&s;t be &s;o; and as his &s;in|gle a&s;&s;ertions are not equal to the united authorities of &s;o many, we may rea&s;onably reject his te&s;timony as a deviation from truth.</P>
<P>We have now &s;een the&s;e &s;cenes of my lord Roche|&s;ter's life, in which he appears to little advantage; it is with infinite plea&s;ure we can take a view of the brighter &s;ide of his character; to do which, we mu&s;t attend him to his death-bed. Had he been the amia|ble man Mr. Wol&s;ely repre&s;ents him, he needed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ot have &s;uffered &s;o many pangs of remor&s;e, nor felt the horrors of con&s;cience, nor been driven almo&s;t to de&s;pair by his reflexions on a mi&s;|pent life.</P>
<P>Roche&s;ter lived a profligate, but he died a penitent. He lived in defiance of all principles; but when he felt the cold hand of death upon him, he reflected on his folly, and &s;aw that the por|tion of iniquity is, at la&s;t, &s;ure to be only pain and angui&s;h.</P>
<P>Dr. Burnet, the excellent bi&s;hop of Sarum (however he may be reviled by a party) with many other obligations conferred upon the world, has added &s;ome account of lord Roche&s;ter in his dy|ing moments. No &s;tate policy in this ca&s;e, can well be &s;uppo&s;ed to have bia&s;&s;ed him, and when there are no motives to fal&s;ehood, it is &s;omewhat cruel to di&s;credit a&s;&s;ertions. The Dr. could not be influenced by views of intere&s;t to give this, or any other account of his lord&s;hip; and could cer|tainly have no other incentive, but that of &s;erv|ing his country, by &s;hewing the in&s;tability of vice, and, by drawing into light an illu&s;trious penitent, adding one wreath more to the banners of virtue.</P>
<P>Burnet begins with telling us, that an accident fell out in the early part of the Earl's life, which in its con&s;equences confirmed him in the pur&s;uit of vicious cour&s;es.<Q REND="inline"><PB N="295" REF="300"><P>"When he went to &s;ea in the year 1665, there happened to be in the &s;ame &s;hip with him, Mr. Montague, and another gentleman of quality; the&s;e two, the former e&s;pecially, &s;eemed per&s;uad|ed that they &s;hould never return into England. Mr. Montague &s;aid, he was &s;ure of it; the other was not &s;o po&s;itive. The earl of Roche&s;ter and the la&s;t of the&s;e entered into a formal engage|ment, not without ceremonies of religion, that if either of them died, he &s;hould appear and give the other notice of the future &s;tate, if there was any. But Mr. Montague would not enter into the bond. When the Day came that they thought to have ta|ken the Dutch fleet in the port of Bergen, Mr. Montague, tho' he had &s;uch a &s;trong pre&s;age in his mind of his approaching death, yet he bravely &s;tayed all the while in the place of the greate&s;t dan|ger. The other gentleman &s;ignalized his courage in the mo&s;t undaunted manner, till near the end of the action; when he fell on a &s;udden into &s;uch a trembling, that he could &s;carce &s;tand: and Mr. Montague going to him to hold him up, as they were in each others arms, a cannon ball carried away Mr. Montague's belly, &s;o that he expired in an hour after."</P></Q></P>
<P>The earl of Roche&s;ter told Dr. Burnet, that the&s;e pre&s;ages they had in their minds, made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on him that there were &s;eparate be|ings, and that the &s;oul either by a natural &s;agacity, or &s;ome &s;ecret notice communicated to it, had a &s;ort of divination. But this gentleman's never ap|pearing was a &s;nare to him during the re&s;t of his life: Though when he mentioned this, he could not but acknowledge, it was an unrea&s;onable thing for him to think that beings in another &s;tate were not under &s;uch laws and limits that they could not command their motion, but as the &s;upreme power &s;hould order them; and that one who had &s;o cor|rapted
<PB N="296" REF="301">
the natural principles of truth as he had, had no rea&s;on to expect that miracles &s;hould be wrought for his conviction.</P>
<P>He told Dr. Burnet another odd pre&s;age of approaching death, in lady Ware, his mo|ther-in-law's family. The chaplain had dreamed that &s;uch a day he &s;hould die; but being by all the family laughed out of the belief of it, he had al|mo&s;t forgot it, till the evening before at &s;upper; there being thirteen at table, according to an old conceit that one of the family mu&s;t &s;oon die, one of the young ladies pointed to him, that he was the per&s;on. Upon this the chaplain recalling to mind his dream, fell into &s;ome di&s;order, and the lady Ware reprowing him for his &s;uper&s;tition, he &s;aid, he was co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">dent he was to die before morning; but he being on perfect health, it was not much minded. It was &s;aturday night, and he was to preach next, day. He went to his chamber and &s;et up late as it appeared by the burning of his candle; and he had been preparing his notes for his &s;ermon, but was found dead in his bed next morning.</P>
<P>The&s;e things his lord&s;hip &s;aid, made him incline to believe that the &s;oul was of a &s;ub&s;tance di&s;tinct, from matter; but that which convinced him of it was, that in his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, which brought him &s;o near his death, when his &s;pirits were &s;o &s;pent he could not move or &s;tir, and did not hope to live an hour, he &s;aid his rea&s;on and judg|ment were &s;o clear and &s;trong, that from thence he was fully per&s;uaded, that death was not the di&s;&s;olution of the &s;oul, but only the &s;epara|tion of it from matter. He had in that &s;ick|ne&s;s great remor&s;e for his pa&s;t life; but he af|terwards &s;aid, they were rather general and dark horrors, than any conviction of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion again&s;t his maker; he was &s;orry he had lived &s;o as to wa&s;te his &s;trength &s;o &s;oon, or that he had brought &s;uch an ill name upon him&s;elf; and had an agony in his
<PB N="297" REF="302">
mind about it, which he knew not well how to expre&s;s, but believed that the&s;e impunctions of con&s;cience rather proceeded from the horror of his condition, than any true contrition for the errors of his life."</P>
<P>During the time Dr. Burnet was at lord Ro|che&s;ter's hou&s;e, they entered frequently into con|ver&s;ation upon the topics of natural and reveal'd religion, which the Dr. endeavoured to enlarge up|on, and explain in a manner &s;uitable to the conditi|on of a dying penitent; his lord&s;hip expre&s;&s;ed much contrition for his having &s;o often violated the laws of the one, again&s;t his better knowledge, and hav|ing &s;purned the authority of the other in the pride of wanton &s;ophi&s;try. He declared that he was &s;a|tisfied of the truth of the chri&s;tian religion, that he thought it the in&s;titution of heaven, and afforded the mo&s;t natural idea of the &s;upreme being, as well as the mo&s;t forcible motives to virtue of any faith profe&s;&s;ed among&s;t men. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'He was not only &s;atisfied (&s;ays Dr. Burnet) of the truth of our holy religion, merely as a matter of &s;peculation, but was per&s;uaded like|wi&s;e of the power of inward grace, of which he gave me this &s;trange account. He &s;aid Mr, Par&s;ons, in order to his conviction, read to him the 53^d chapter of the prophe&s;ies of I&s;aiah, and compared that with the hi&s;tory of our Saviour's pa&s;&s;ion, that he might there &s;ee a prophe&s;y con|cerning it, written many ages before it was done; which the Jews that bla&s;phemed Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;till kept in their hands as a book divinely in&s;pired. He &s;aid, as he heard it read, he felt an inward force upon him, which did &s;o enlighten his mind and convince him, that he could re&s;i&s;t it no longer, for the words had an authority which did &s;hoot like rays or beams in his mind, &s;o that he was not only convinced by the rea&s;onings he had
<PB N="298" REF="303">
about it, which &s;atisfied his under&s;tanding, but by a power, which did &s;o effectually con&s;train him that he ever after firmly believed in his Savi|our, as if he had &s;een him in the clouds.'</P></Q></P>
<P>We are not quite certain whether there is not a tincture of enthu&s;ia&s;m in this account given by his lord&s;hip, as it is too natural to fly from one extreme to another, from the exce&s;&s;es of debau|chery to the gloom of methodi&s;m; but even if we &s;uppo&s;e this to have been the ca&s;e, he was cer|tainly in the &s;afe&s;t extreme; and there is more comfort in hearing that a man who&s;e life had been &s;o remarkably pro&s;&s;igate as his, &s;hould die under &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions, than quit the world without one pang for pa&s;t o&s;&s;ences.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop gives an in&s;tance of the grea alteration of his lord&s;hip's temper and di&s;po&s;i|tions (from what they were formerly) in his &s;ick|ne&s;s. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Whenever he happened to be out of order. either by pain or &s;ickne&s;s, his temper became quite ungovernable, and his pa&s;&s;ions &s;o &s;ierce, that his &s;ervants were afraid to approach him. But in this la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s he was all humility, pa|tience, and re&s;ignation. Once he was a little offended with the delay of a &s;ervant, who he thought made not ba&s;te enough, with &s;omewhat he called for, and &s;aid in a little heat, that damn'd fellow.'</Q> Soon after, &s;ays the Dr. I told him that I was glad to find his &s;tile &s;o reformed, and that he had &s;o entirely overcome that ill habit of &s;wearing, only that word of calling any damned which had returned upon him was not decent; his an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'O that language of fiends, which was &s;o familiar to me, hangs yet about me, &s;ure none has de&s;erved more to be damned than I have done; and after he had hambly a&s;ked God par|don for it, he de&s;ired me to call the per&s;on to him

that he might ask him forgivene&s;s; but I told him that was needle&s;s, for he had &s;aid it of one who did not hear it, and &s;o could not be o&s;&s;ended by it. In this di&s;po&s;ition of mind, continues the bi&s;hop, all the while I was with him four days together; he was then brought &s;o low that all hope of recovery was gone. Much pu|rulent matter came from him with his urine, which he pa&s;&s;ed always with pain, but one day with in|expre&s;&s;ible torment; yet he bore it decently, with|out breaking out into repinings, or impatient complaints. Nature being at la&s;t quite exhau&s;ted, and all the floods of life gone, he died without a groan on the 26th of July 1680, in the 33d year of his age. A day or two before his death he lay much &s;ilent, and &s;eemed extremely devont in his contemplations; he was frequently ob&s;erved to rai&s;e his eyes to heaven, and &s;end forth eja|culations to the &s;earcher of hearts, who &s;aw his penitence, and who, he hoped, would forgive him.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus died lord Roche&s;ter, an amazing in&s;tance of the goodne&s;s of God, who permitted him to enjoy time, and inclined his heart to penitence. As by his life he was &s;uffered to &s;et an exam||ple of the mo&s;t abandoned di&s;&s;olutene&s;s to the world: &s;o by his death, he was a lively demon&s;tration of the fruitle&s;&s;ne&s;s of vicious cour&s;es, and may be pro|po&s;ed as an example to all tho&s;e who are captivated with the charms of guilty plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Let all his failings now &s;leep with him in the grave, and let us only think of his clo&s;ing mo|ments, his penitence, and reformation. Had he been permitted to have recovered his illne&s;s, it is rea&s;onable to pre&s;ume he would have been as lively an example of virtue as he had ever been of vice, and have born his te&s;timony in &s;a|vour of religion.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="305">
He left behind him a &s;on named Charles, who dying on the 12th of November, was buried by his father on the 7th of December following: he al&s;o left behind him three daughters. The male line cea&s;ing, Charles II. conferred the title of earl of Roche&s;ter on Lawrence vi&s;count Killingworth, a younger &s;on of Edward earl of Clarendon.</P>
<P>We might now enumerate his lord&s;hip's writ|ings, of which we have already given &s;ome cha|racter; but unhappily for the world they are too generally diffu&s;ed, and we think our&s;elves under no obligations to particularize tho&s;e works which have been &s;o fruitful of mi&s;chief to &s;ociety, by promoting a general corruption of morals; and which he him&s;elf in his la&s;t moments wi&s;hed he could recal, or rather that he never had com|po&s;ed.</P>

<P>It was the good fortune of this nobleman to have an equal intere&s;t with the &s;on as with the father; and when prince Charles a&s;cended the throne, his power was equally exten&s;ive, and as before gave &s;uch offence to the Hou&s;e of Commons and the people, that he was vo|ted an enemy to the realm, and his Maje&s;ty was frequently addre&s;&s;ed to remove him from his councils. Tho' Charles I. had certainly more vir|tues, and was of a more military turn than his father, yet in the circum&s;tance of doating upon fa|vourites, he was equally weak. His misfortune was, that he never &s;ufficiently tru&s;ted his own judgment, which was often better than that of

his &s;ervants; and from this diffidence he was te|nacious of a mini&s;ter of who&s;e abilities he had a high opinion, and in who&s;e fidelity he put con|fidence.</P>
<P>The duke at la&s;t became &s;o obnoxious, that it entered into the head of an enthu&s;ia&s;t, tho' other|wi&s;e an hone&s;t man, one lieutenant Felton, that to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate this court favourite, this enemy of the realm, would be doing a grateful thing to his country by ridding it of one who&s;e mea&s;ures in his opinion, were likely &s;oon to de&s;troy it.&mdash;</P>

<P>We &s;hall in&s;ert, in the words of the noble hi|&s;torian, the particular account of it. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'John Felton, an ob&s;cure man in his own per|&s;on, who had been bred a &s;oldier, and lately a lieutenant of foot, who&s;e captain had been killed on the retreat at the I&s;le of Ree, upon which he conceived that the company of right ought to have been conferred upon him; and it being refu&s;ed him by the duke of Buckingham, ge|neral of the army, had given up his commi&s;&s;ion and withdrawn him&s;elf from the army.

<P>As this anecdote is countenanced by &s;o great a name, I need make no apology for in&s;erting it, it has all the evidence the nature of the thing can admit of, and is curious in it&s;elf. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'There was an officer in the King's wardrobe in Wind&s;or-Ca&s;tle of a good reputation for ho|ne&s;ty and di&s;cretion, and then about the age of fifty years, or more.

<P>'But the next morning waking exceedingly per|plexed with the lively repre&s;entation of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, he con&s;idered that he was a per&s;on at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the duke, that he knew not how to find any admittance into his pre&s;ence, much le&s;s any hope to be believed in what he &s;hould &s;ay, &s;o

with great trouble and unquietne&s;s he &s;pent &s;ome time in thinking what he &s;hould do.

<P>'In the morning the poor man more confirmed by the la&s;t appearance, made his journey to London, where the court then was. He was very well known to Sir Ralph Freeman, one of the ma&s;ters of the reque&s;ts, who had married a lady that was nearly allied to the duke, and was him&s;elf well received by him. To him this man went; and tho' he did not acquaint him with all the particulars, he &s;aid enough to him to let him &s;ee there was &s;omewhat extra|ordinary in it, and the knowledge he had of the &s;obriety and di&s;cretion of the man, made the more impre&s;&s;ion on him. He de&s;ired that by

his means he might be brought to the duke, to &s;uch a place, and in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould be thought fit; affirming, that he had much to &s;ay to him; and of &s;uch a nature as would re|quire much privacy, and &s;ome time and patience in the hearing. Sir Ralph promi&s;ed he would &s;peak fir&s;t to the duke of him, and then he &s;hould under&s;tand his plea&s;ure, and accordingly on the fir&s;t opportunity he did inform him of the reputation and hone&s;ty of the man, and then what he de&s;ired, and all he knew of the mat|ter. The duke according to his u&s;ual openne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion told him, that he was the next day, early, to hunt with the King; that his hor&s;es &s;hould attend him to Lambeth Bridge, where he would land by five o'Clock in the morning, and if the man attended him there at that hour, he would walk and &s;peak with him as long as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. Sir Ralph car|ried the man with him next morning, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e|&s;ented him to the duke at his landing, who re|ceived him courteou&s;ly, and walked a&s;ide in con|ference near an hour, none but his own &s;ervants being at that hour near the place, and they and Sir Ralph at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that they could not hear a word, though the duke &s;ometimes &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ke, and with great commotion, which Sir Ralph the more ea&s;ily perceived, becau&s;e he kept his eyes always fixed upon the duke; having pro|cured the conference, upon &s;omewhat he knew, there was of extraordinary; and the man told him in his return over the water, that when he mentioned tho&s;e particulars, which were to gain him credit, the &s;ub&s;tance whereof he &s;aid he dur&s;t not impart to him, the duke's colour changed, and he &s;wore he could come by that knowledge only by the devil, for that tho&s;e particulars were known only to him&s;elf, and to one per&s;on more, who, he was &s;ure, would never &s;peak of it.'</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="318">
'The duke pur&s;ued his purpo&s;e of hunting, but was ob&s;erved to ride all the morning with great pen&s;ivene&s;s, and in deep thoughts, without any delight in the exerci&s;e he was upon, and before the morning was &s;pent, left the field, and alight|ed at his mother's lodgings at Whitehall, with whom he was &s;hut up for the &s;pace of two or three hours, the noi&s;e of their di&s;cour&s;e fre|quently reaching the ears of tho&s;e who attend|ed in the next rooms and when the duke left her, his countenance appeared full of trouble, with a mixture of anger: a countenance that was never before ob&s;erved in him in any con|ver&s;ation with her, towards whom he had a profound reverence, and the counte&s;s her&s;elf was, at the duke's leaving her, found overwhelmed in tears, and in the highe&s;t agony imaginable; whatever there was of all this, it is a notorious truth, that when the news of the duke's mur|der (which happened within a few months) was brought to his mother, &s;he &s;eemed not in the lea&s;t degree &s;urprized, but received it as if &s;he had fore&s;een it, nor did afterwards expre&s;s &s;uch a degree of &s;orrow, as was expected from &s;uch a mother, for the lo&s;s of &s;uch a &s;on.'</P></Q></P>

great figure, even in the &s;enate, but his love of plea&s;ure was immoderate, which embarra&s;&s;ed him in the pur&s;uit of any thing &s;olid or prai&s;e-worthy.</P>
<P>He was an infant when his father's murder was perpetrated, and received his early education from &s;everal dome&s;tic tutors, and was afterwards &s;ent to the univer&s;ity of Cambridge: when he had fini&s;h|ed his cour&s;e there, he travelled with his brother lord Francis, under the care of William Ayle&s;bury, e&s;quire. Upon his return, which was after the breaking out of the civil wars, he was conducted to Oxford, and pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, then there, and entered into Chri&s;t Church. Upon the decline of the King's cau&s;e, the young duke of Buckingham attended Prince Charles into Scot|land, and was pre&s;ent in the year 1651 at the battle of Worce&s;ter, where he e&s;caped beyond &s;ea, and was &s;oon after made knight of the garter.

After the re&s;toration, at which time he is &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an e&s;tate of 20,000 l. per annum, he was made one of the lords of the King's bed-chamber, and of the privy council, lord lieutenant of York&s;hire, and, at la&s;t, ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e.</P>

Mr. Thomas Carte, in his Life of the Duke of Ormond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B. vl. vol. ii. p. 347.</NOTE>,
<PB N="315" REF="320">
tells us, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that the duke's being denied the po&s;t of pre&s;ident of the North, was probably the rea&s;on of his di&s;affection to the King; and, that ju&s;t before the rece&s;s of the Parliament, one Dr. John Heydon was taken up for trea&s;onable practices, in &s;owing a &s;edition in the navy, and engaging per&s;ons in a con&s;piracy to &s;eize the Tower. The man was a pretender to great &s;kill in a&s;trology, but had lo&s;t much of his reputa|tion, by progno&s;ticating the hanging of Oliver to his &s;on Richard Cromwel and Thurloe, who came to him in di&s;gui&s;e, for the calculation of nativities, being dre&s;&s;ed like di&s;tre&s;&s;ed cavaliers. He was for that put into pri&s;on, and continued in confinement &s;ixteen months, whil&s;t Cromwel outlived the prediction four years. This in&s;ig|nificant fellow was mighty great with the duke of Buckingham, who, notwith&s;tanding the va|nity of the art, and the notorious ignorance of the profe&s;&s;or of it, made him ca&s;t not only his own, but the King's nativity; a matter of dan|gerous curio&s;ity, and condemned by a &s;tatute which could only be &s;aid to be antiquated, be|cau&s;e it had not for a long time been put in ex|ecution. This fellow he had likewi&s;e employed, among others, to excite the &s;eamen to mutiny, as he had given money to other rogues to put on jackets to per&s;onate &s;eamen, and to go about the country begging in that garb, and exclaim|ing for want of pay, while the people oppre&s;&s;ed with taxes, were cheated of their money by the great officers of the crown. Heydon pretended to have been in all the duke's &s;ecrets, for near four years pa&s;t, and that he had been all that time de&s;igning again&s;t the King and his govern|ment, that his grace thought the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on favourable for the execution of his de&s;ign, and had his agents at work in the navy and in the kingdom, to ripen the general di&s;contents of the

people, and di&s;po&s;e them to action, that he had been importuned by him to head the fir&s;t party he could get together, and engage in an in&s;ur|rection, the duke declaring his readine&s;s to ap|pear and join in the undertaking, as &s;oon as the affair was begun. Some to whom Heydon un|bo&s;omed him&s;elf, and had been employed by him to carry letters to the duke of Bucking|ham, di&s;covered the de&s;ign. Heydon was taken up, and a &s;erjeant at arms &s;ent with a warrant by his Maje&s;ty's expre&s;s order to take up the duke, who, having defended his hou&s;e by force, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, found means to e&s;cape. The King knew Buckingham to be capable of the blacke&s;t de&s;igns, and was highly incen&s;ed at him for his conduct la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions, and in&s;inuating that &s;pirit into the Commons, which had been &s;o much to the detriment of the public &s;er|vice. He could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with more bitterne&s;s again&s;t the duke, than was ever dropped from him upon any other occa&s;ion. When he was &s;ollicited in his behalf, he frankly &s;aid, that he had been the cau&s;e of continuing the war, for the Dutch would have made a ve|ry low-&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, had the Parliament continu|ed their fir&s;t vigorous vote of &s;upplying him, but the duke's cabals had le&s;&s;ened his intere&s;t both abroad and at home, with regard to the &s;upport of the war. In con&s;equence of this re|&s;entment, the King put him out of the privy council, bedchamber, and lientenancy of York, ordering him likewi&s;e to be &s;truck out of all commi&s;&s;ions. His grace ab&s;conding, a proc&s;a|mation was i&s;&s;ued out, requiring his appear|ance, and &s;urrender of him&s;elf by a certain day.'</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this appearance of re&s;entment again&s;t him, yet Charles, who was far from be|ing of an implacable temper, took Buckingham again into favour, after he had made an humble &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion;
<PB N="317" REF="322">
he was re&s;tored to his place in the coun|cil, and in the bedchamber in 1667, and &s;eem|ed perfectly confirmed in the good graces of the King, who was, perhaps, too much charmed with his wit to con&s;ider him as an enemy.</P>
<P>In the year 1670, the duke was &s;uppo&s;ed to be concerned in Blood's attempt on the life of the duke of Ormond. This &s;cheme was to have con|veyed that nobleman to Tyburn, and there to have hanged him; for which purpo&s;e he was taken out of his coach in St. James's Street, and carried away by Blood and his &s;on beyond Devon&s;hire Hou&s;e, Piccadilly, but then re&s;cued. Blood after|wards endeavoured to &s;teal the crown out of the Tower, but was &s;eized; however, he was not on|ly pardoned, but had an e&s;tate of five hundred pounds a year given him in Ireland, and admitted into an intimacy with the King. The rea&s;on of Blood's malice again&s;t the duke of Ormond was, be|cau&s;e his e&s;tate at Sorney was forfeited for his trea&s;on in the cour&s;e of government, and mu&s;t have been done by any lord lieutenant whatever. This, to|gether with the in&s;tigation of &s;ome enemy of the duke of Ormond's at court, wrought upon him &s;o, that he undertook the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. Mr. Carte &s;uppo&s;es, that no man was more likely to encou|rage Blood in this attempt, than the duke of Buck|ingham, who, he &s;ays was the mo&s;t profligate man of his time, and had &s;o little honour in him, that he would engage in any &s;cheme to gratify an irregular pa&s;&s;ion. The duke of Ormond had acted with &s;ome &s;everity again&s;t him, when he was detected in the attempt of unhinging the government, which had excited &s;o much re&s;ent|ment, as to vent it&s;elf in this manner. Mr. Carte likewi&s;e charges the duche&s;s of Cleveland with con&s;piring again&s;t Ormond, but has given no rea|&s;ons why he thinks &s;he in&s;tigated the attempt.

The duche&s;s was cou&s;in to the duke of Bucking|ham, but it appears in the Annals of Gallantry of tho&s;e times, that &s;he never loved him, nor is it probable &s;he engaged with him in &s;o dangerous a &s;cheme.</P>
<P>That Buckingham was a con&s;pirator again&s;t Or|mond, Mr. Carte &s;ays, there is not the lea&s;t doubt; and he mentions a circum&s;tance of his guilt too &s;trong to be re&s;i&s;ted. That there were rea&s;ons to think him the per&s;on who put Blood upon the attempt of the duke of Ormond, (&s;ays he) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'cannot well be que&s;tioned, after the following relation, which I had from a gentleman (Robert Le&s;ly of Gla&s;lough, in the county of Monaghan, e&s;quire) who&s;e veracity and memory, none that knew him, will ever doubt, who received it from the mouth of Dr. Turner, bi&s;hop of Ely. The earl of O&s;&s;ory came in one day, not long after the affair, and &s;eeing the duke of Bucking|ham &s;tanding by the King, his colour ro&s;e, and he &s;poke to this effect; My lord, I know well, that you are at the bottom of this late attempt of Blood's upon my father, and therefore I give you fair warning, if my father comes to a violent end by &s;word or pi&s;tol, or the more &s;e|cret way of poi&s;on, I &s;hall not be at a lo&s;s to know the fir&s;t author of it; I &s;hall con&s;ider you as the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; I &s;hall treat you as &s;uch, and wherever I meet you, I &s;hall pi&s;tol you, though you &s;tood behind the King's chair, and I tell it you in his Maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence, that you may be &s;ure I &s;hall keep my word.'</Q> I know not whe|ther this will be deemed any breach of decorum to the King, in who&s;e pre&s;ence it was &s;aid, but, in my opinion, it was an act of &s;pirit and re&s;ent|ment worthy of a &s;on, when his father's life was menaced, and the villain (Blood) who failed in the attempt, was &s;o much courted, care&s;&s;ed, and in high favour immediately afterwards.</P>

In June 1671, the duke was in&s;talled chancel|lor of the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, and the &s;ame year was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to the King of France; who being plea&s;ed with his per&s;on and errand, entertained him very nobly for &s;everal days together; and upon his taking leave, gave him a &s;word and belt &s;et with Pearls and Dia|monds, to the value of 40,000 pi&s;toles. He was afterwards &s;ent to that King at Utrecht in June 1672, together with Henry earl of Arlington, and George lord Hallifax. He was one of the cabal at Whitehall, and in the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, February 1672, endeavoured to ca&s;t the odium of the Dutch war from him&s;elf, upon lord Arlington, another of the cabal. In June 1674, he refigned the chancellor&s;hip of Cam|bridge. About this time he became a great fa|vourer of the Nonconformi&s;ts. February 16, 1676, his grace, and James earl of Salisbury, Anthony earl of Shaft&s;bury, and Philip lord Wharton, were committed to the Tower by order of the Hou&s;e of Lords, for a contempt, in refu&s;ing to retract what they had &s;aid the day before, when the duke, immediately after his Maje&s;ty had ended his &s;peech to both Hou&s;es, endeavoured to &s;hew from law and rea&s;on, that the long prorogation was nulled, and the Parliament was con&s;equently di&s;&s;olved.</P>

we may certainly gather from the plays ridiculed in it, that it was before the end of 1663, and fi|ni&s;hed before 1664, becau&s;e it had been &s;everal times rehear&s;ed, the players were perfect in their parts, and all things in readine&s;s for its acting, before the great plague in 1665, and that then prevented it, for what was then intended, was very different from what now appears. In that he called his poet Bilboa, by which name Sir Robert Howard was the per&s;on pointed at. Dur|ing this interval, many plays were publi&s;hed, written in heroic rhime, and on the death of Sir William Davenant 1669, whom Mr. Dry|den &s;ucceeded in the laurel, it became &s;till in greater vogue; this moved the duke to change the name of his poet, from Bilboa to Bayes.'</Q></P>
<P>This character of Bayes is inimitably drawn; in it the various foibles of poets (whether good, bad, or indifferent) are &s;o excellently blended, as to make the mo&s;t fini&s;hed picture of a poetic&acirc;l cox|comb: 'Tis &s;uch a ma&s;ter-piece of true humour as will ever la&s;t, while our Engli&s;h tongue is un|der&s;tood, or the &s;tage affords a good comedian to play it.

As this is a truth, I give it to the candid; and let the relation take its chance, though it &s;hould not be thought by &s;ome (who may not abound in good nature) that I only mean by this, to pay due re|gard to the merit of the piece, though it &s;peaks for it&s;elf; for, without extraordinary merit in the writing, it could never have gained &s;uch an un|common run, at the di&s;tance of four&s;core years from its being fir&s;t written, when mo&s;t of tho&s;e

<P>Mr. Dryden, in revenge for the ridicule thrown on him in this piece, expo&s;ed the duke under the name of Zimri in his Ab&s;alom and Achitophel. This character, drawn by Dryden, is reckoned a ma&s;terpiece; it has the fir&s;t beauty, which is truth; it is a &s;triking picture, and admirably marked: We need make no apology for in&s;erting it here; it is too excellent to pa&s;s unnoticed.<Q><L>In the fir&s;t rank of the&s;e did Zimri &s;tand:</L>

It is allowed by the &s;evere&s;t enemies of this no|bleman, that he had a great &s;hare of vivacity, and quickne&s;s of parts, which were particularly turned to ridicule; but while he has been celebrated as a wit, all men are &s;ilent as to other virtues, for it is no where recorded, that he ever performed one gene|rous di&s;intere&s;ted action in his whole life; he re|lieved no di&s;tre&s;&s;ed merit; he never &s;hared the ble&s;&s;ing of the widow and fatherle&s;s, and as he lived a profligate, he died in mi&s;ery, a by-word and a je&s;t, unpitied and unmourned.</P>

<HEAD>THOMAS OTWAY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS excellent poet was not more remarka|ble for moving the tender pa&s;&s;ions, than for the variety of fortune, to which he was &s;ub|jected. We have &s;ome where read an ob&s;ervation,
<PB N="325" REF="330">
that the poets have ever been the lea&s;t philo&s;ophers, and were always unhappy in a want of firmne&s;s of temper, and &s;teadine&s;s of re&s;olution: of the truth of this remark, poor Mr. Otway is a lively in|&s;tance; he never could &s;ufficiently combat his ap|petite of extravagance and profu&s;ion, to live one year in a comfortable competence, but was either rioting in luxurious indulgence, or &s;hivering with want, and expo&s;ed to the in&s;olence and contempt of the world. He was the &s;on of Mr. Humphry Otway, rector of Wolbeding in Su&s;&s;ex, and was born at Trottin in that country, on March 3, 1651. He received his education at Wickeham &s;chool, near, Winche&s;ter, and became a commoner of Chri&s;t Church in Oxford, in the beginning of the year 1669. He quitted the univer&s;ity without a degree, and retired to London, though, in the opinion of &s;ome hi&s;torians, he went afterwards to Cambridge, which &s;eems very probable, from a copy of ver&s;es of Mr. Duke's to him, between whom &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a &s;incere friend&s;hip till the death of Mr. Otway. When our poet came to London, the fir&s;t account we hear of him, is, that he commenced player, but without &s;ucce&s;s, for he is &s;aid to have failed in want of execution, which is &s;o material to a good player, that a tolerable execution, with ad|vantage of a good per&s;on, will often &s;upply the place of judgment, in which it is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed Otway was deficient.</P>
<P>Though his &s;ucce&s;s as an actor was but indif|ferent, yet he gained upon the world by the &s;pright|line&s;s of his conver&s;ation, and the acutene&s;s of his wit, which, it &s;eems, gained him the favour of Charles Fitz Charles, earl of Plymouth, one of the natural &s;ons of King Charles II. who procured him a cornet's Pommi&s;&s;ion in the new rai&s;ed Engli&s;h forces de&s;igned for Flanders. All who have written of Mr. Otway ob&s;erve, that he re|turned from Flanders in very nece&s;&s;itous circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="326" REF="331">
but give no account how that rever&s;e of fortune happened: it is not natural to &s;uppo&s;e that it proceeded from actual cowardice, or that Mr. Otway had drawn down any di&s;grace upon him&s;elf by mi&s;behaviour in a military &s;tation. If this had been the ca&s;e, he wanted not enemies who would have improved the circum&s;tance, and recorded it again&s;t him, with a malicious &s;atis|faction; but if it did not proceed from actual cow|ardice, yet we have &s;ome rea&s;on to conjecture that Mr. Otway felt a &s;trong di&s;inclination to a mili|tary life, perhaps from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that his heart failed him, and a dread of misbehaving, &s;hould he ever be called to an engagement; and to avoid the &s;hame of which he was apprehen&s;ive in con&s;equence of &s;uch behaviour, he, in all proba|bility, re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion, which could not but di&s;oblige the earl of Plymouth, and expo&s;e him|&s;elf to nece&s;&s;ity. What pity is it, that he who could put &s;uch ma&s;culine &s;trong &s;entiments into the mouth of &s;uch a re&s;olute hero as his own Pierre, &s;hould him&s;elf fail in per&s;onal courage, but this quality nature withheld from him, and he exchanged the chance of reaping laurels in the field of victory, for the equally uncertain, and more barren laurels of poetry. The earl of Roche&s;ter, in his Se&s;&s;ion of the Poets, has thus maliciou&s;ly recorded, and without the lea&s;t grain of wit, the deplorable circum&s;tances of Otway.<Q><L>Tom Otway came next, Tom Shadwell's dear Zany,</L>

Mr. Otway tran&s;lated out of French into Eng|li&s;h, the Hi&s;tory of the Triumvirate; the Fir&s;t Part of Julius Cae&s;ar, Pompey and Cra&s;&s;us, the Second Part of Augu&s;tus, Anthony and Lepidus, being a faithful collection from the be&s;t hi&s;torians, and other authors, concerning the revolution of the Roman government, which happened under their authority, London 1686 in 8vo. Our author find|ing his nece&s;&s;ities pre&s;s, had recour&s;e to writing for the &s;tage, which he did with various &s;ucce&s;s: his comedy has been blamed for having too much libertini&s;m mixed with it; but in tragedy he made it his bu&s;ine&s;s, for the mo&s;t part, to ob&s;erve the decorum of the &s;tage. He has certainly followed nature in the language of his tragedy, and there|fore &s;hines in the pa&s;&s;ionate parts more than any of our Engli&s;h poets. As there is &s;omething fa|miliar and dome&s;tic in the fable of his tragedy, he has little pomp, but great energy in his ex|pre&s;&s;ions; for which rea&s;on, though he has ad|mirably &s;ucceeded in the tender and melting parts of his tragedies, he &s;ometimes falls into too great a familiarity of phra&s;e in tho&s;e, which, by Ari|&s;totle's rule, ought to have been rai&s;ed and &s;up|ported by the dignity of expre&s;&s;ion. It has been ob&s;erved by the critics, that the poet has found|ed his tragedy of Venice Pre&s;erved, on &s;o wrong a plot, that the greate&s;t characters in it are tho&s;e of rebels and traitors. Had the hero of this pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;covered the &s;ame good qualities in defence of his country, that he &s;hewed for his ruin and &s;ub|ver&s;ion, the audience could not enough pity and admire him; but as he is now repre&s;ented, we can only &s;ay of him, what the Roman hi&s;torian &s;ays of Catiline, that his fall would have been glori|ous (&s;i pro Patria &s;ec concidi&s;&s;et) had he &s;o fallen in the &s;ervice of his country.</P>
<P>Mr. Charles Gildon, in his Laws of Poetry, &s;tiles Mr. Otway a Poet of the fir&s;t Magnitude,
<PB N="328" REF="333">
and tells us, and with great ju&s;tice, that he was perfect ma&s;ter of the tragic pa&s;&s;ions, and draws them every where with a delicate and natural &s;implicity, and therefore never fails to rai&s;e &s;trong emotions in the &s;oul. I don't know of a &s;tronger in&s;tance of this force, than in the play of the Orphan; the tragedy is com|po&s;ed of per&s;ons who&s;e fortunes do not ex|ceed the quality of &s;uch as we ordinarily call people of condition, and without the advantage of having the &s;cene heightened by the importance of the characters; his inimitable &s;kill in repre|&s;enting the workings of the heart, and its af|fection, is &s;uch that the circum&s;tances are great from the art of the poet, rather than from the figure of the per&s;ons repre&s;ented. The whole drama is admirably wrought, and the mixture of pa&s;&s;ions rai&s;ed from affinity, gratitude, love, and mi&s;under&s;tanding between brethren, ill u&s;age from per&s;ons obliged &s;lowly returned by the benefactors, keeps the mind in a continual anxiety and con|trition. The &s;entiments of the unhappy Moni|mia are delicate and natural, &s;he is mi&s;erable with|out guilt, but incapable of living with a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having committed an ill act, though her inclination had no part in it. Mrs. Barry, the celebrated actre&s;s, u&s;ed to &s;ay, that in her part of Monimia in the Orphan, &s;he never &s;poke the&s;e words, Ah! poor Ca&s;talio, without tears; upon which occa&s;ion Mr. Gildon ob&s;erves, that all the pathetic force had been lo&s;t, if any more words had been added, and the poet would have en|deavoured, in vain, to have heightened them, by the addition of figures of &s;peech, &s;ince the beauty of tho&s;e three plain &s;imple words is &s;o great by the force of nature, that they mu&s;t have been weakened and ob&s;cured by the fine&s;t flowers of rhetoric.</P>
<P>The tragedy of the Orphan is not without great blemi&s;hes, which the writer of a cri&s;ici&s;m
<PB N="329" REF="334">
on it, publi&s;hed in the Gentleman's Maga|zine, has very judiciou&s;ly and candidly &s;hewn. The impetuous pa&s;&s;ion of Polydore breaks out &s;ometimes in a language not &s;ufficiently delicate, particularly in that celebrated pa&s;&s;age where he talks of ru&s;hing upon her in a &s;torm of love. The &s;imile of the bull is very offen&s;ive to cha&s;te ears, but poor Otway lived in di&s;&s;olute times, and his nece&s;&s;ity obliged him to fan the harlot-face of loo&s;e de&s;ire, in compliance to the general cor|ruption. Monimia &s;taying to conver&s;e with Po|lydor, after he vauntingly di&s;covers his &s;ucce&s;s in deceiving her, is &s;hocking; had &s;he left him abrupt|ly, with a wildne&s;s of horror, that might have thrown him under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking an ex|planation from Ca&s;talio, the &s;cene would have ended better, would have kept the audience more in &s;u&s;pence, and been an improvement of the con|&s;equential &s;cene between the brothers: but this re|mark is &s;ubmitted to &s;uperior judges.</P>
<P>Venice Pre&s;erved is &s;till a greater proof of his influence over our pa&s;&s;ions, and the faculty of mingling good and bad characters, and involving their fortunes, &s;eems to be the di&s;tingui&s;hed excel|lence of this writer. He very well knew that no|thing but di&s;tre&s;&s;ed virtue can &s;trongly touch us with pity, and therefore, in this play, that we may have a greater regard for the con&s;pirators, he makes Pierre talk of redre&s;&s;ing wrongs, and re|peat all the common place of male-contents.<Q><L>To &s;ee the &s;ufferings of my fellow-creatures,</L>

<P>The above is the mo&s;t awful picture of a man plunged in de&s;pair, that ever was drawn by a po|et; we cannot read it without terror: and when it is uttered as we have heard it, from the late ju&s;tly celebrated Booth, or tho&s;e heart-affecting actors Garrick, and Barry, the fle&s;h creeps, and the blood is chilled with horror.</P>
<P>In this play Otway catches our hearts, by intro|ducing the epi&s;ode of Belvidera. Private and pub|lic calamities alternately claim our concern; &s;ome|times we could wi&s;h to &s;ee a whole State &s;acrificed for the weeping Belvidera, who&s;e character and di&s;tre&s;s are &s;o drawn as to melt every heart; at other times we recover again, in behalf of a whole people in danger. There is not a virtuous character in the play, but that of Bel|videra, and yet &s;o amazing is the force of the author's &s;kill in blending private and public con|cerns, that the ruffian on the wheel, is as much the object of pity, as if he had been brought to that unhappy fate by &s;ome honourable action.</P>
<P>Though Mr. Otway po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this a&s;toni&s;hing talent of moving the pa&s;&s;ions, and writing to the heart, yet he was held in great contempt by &s;ome cotemporary poets, and was &s;everal times un&s;uc|ce&s;sful in his dramatic pieces. The merits of an author are &s;eldom ju&s;tly e&s;timated, till the next age after his decea&s;e; while a man lives in the world, he has pa&s;&s;ion, prejudice, private and public malevolence to combat; his enemies are in|du&s;trious to ob&s;cure his fame, by drawing into light his private follies; and per&s;onal malice is up in arms again&s;t every man of genius.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="337">
Otway was expo&s;ed to powerful enemies, who could not bear that he &s;hould acquire fame, among&s;t whom Dryden is the foremo&s;t. The en|mity between Dryden and Otway could not pro|ceed from jealou&s;y, for what were Otway's, when put in the ballance with the amazing powers of Dryden? like a drop to the ocean: and yet we find Dryden declared him&s;elf his open enemy; for which, the be&s;t rea&s;on that can be a&s;&s;igned is, that Otway was a retainer to Shadwell, who was Dryden's aver&s;ion. Dryden was often heard to &s;ay, that Otway was a barren illiterate man, but <Q REND="inline">'I confe&s;s, &s;ays he, he has a power which I have not;'</Q> and when it was asked him, what power that was? he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'moving the pa&s;&s;ions.'</Q> This truth was, no doubt, extorted from Dryden, for he &s;eems not to be very ready in acknowledging the merits of his cotemporaries. In his preface to Du Fre&s;noy's Art of Painting, which he tran|&s;lated, he mentions Otway with re&s;pect, but not till after he was dead; and even then he &s;peaks but coldly of him. The pa&s;&s;age is as follows, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'To expre&s;s the pa&s;&s;ions which are &s;eated on the heart by outward &s;igns, is one great precept of the painters, and very difficult to perform. In poetry the very &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, and motions of the mind are to be expre&s;&s;ed, and in this con|&s;i&s;ts the principal difficulty, as well as the excel|lency of that art. This (&s;ays my author) is the gift of Jupiter, and to &s;peak in the &s;ame Hea|then language, is the gift of our Apollo, not to be obtained by pains or &s;tudy, if we are not born to it; for the motions which are &s;tudied, are never &s;o natural, as tho&s;e which break out in the heighth of a real pa&s;&s;ion. Mr. Otway po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this part as thoroughly as any of either the ancients or moderns. I will not defend every thing in his Venice Pre&s;erved, but I mu&s;t bear this te&s;timony to his memory, that the pa&s;&s;ions
<PB N="333" REF="338">
are truly touched in it, though, perhaps, there is &s;omewhat to be de&s;ired, both in the grounds of them, and the heighth and elegance of ex|pre&s;&s;ion; but nature is there, which is the great|e&s;t beauty.'</Q> Notwith&s;tanding our admiration of Dryden, we cannot, without &s;ome indignation, ob&s;erve, how &s;paring he is in the prai&s;es of Otway, who, con&s;idered as a tragic writer, was &s;urely &s;uperior to him&s;elf. Dryden enchants us indeed with flow'ry de&s;criptions, and charms us with (what is called) the magic of poetry; but he has &s;eldom drawn a tear, and milli|ons of radiant eyes have been witne&s;&s;es for Ot|way, by tho&s;e drops of pity which they have &s;hed. Otway might be no &s;cholar, but that, me|thinks, does not detract from the merit of a dra|mati&s;t, nor much a&s;&s;i&s;t him in &s;ucceeding. For the truth of this we may appeal to experience. No poets in our language, who were what we call &s;cholars, have ever written plays which delight or affect the audience. Shake&s;pear, Otway and Southern were no &s;cholars; Ben John&s;on, Dry|den and Addi&s;on were: and while few audiences admire the plays of the latter, tho&s;e of the for|mer are the &s;upports of the &s;tage.</P>
<P>After &s;uffering many eclip&s;es of fortune, and being expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t cruel nece&s;&s;ities, poor Otway died of want, in a public hou&s;e on Tower-hill, in the 33^d year of his age, 1685. He had, no doubt, been driven to that part of the town, to avoid the per&s;ecution of his cre|ditors, and as he dur&s;t not appear much abroad to &s;ollicit a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and having no means of get|ting money in his ob&s;cure retreat, he peri&s;hed. It has been reported, that Mr. Otway, whom deli|cacy had long deterred from borrowing &s;mall &s;ums, driven at la&s;t to the mo&s;t grievous nece&s;&s;i|ty ventured out of his lurking place, almo&s;t naked and &s;hivering, and went into a coffee-hou&s;e on Tow|er-hill,
<PB N="334" REF="339">
where he &s;aw a gentleman, of whom he had &s;ome knowledge, and of whom he &s;ollicited the loan of a &s;hilling. The gentleman was quite &s;hocked, to &s;ee the author of Venice Pre&s;erved begging bread, and compa&s;&s;ionately put into his hand a guinea.</P>
<P>Mr. Otway having thanked his benefactor, re|tired, and changed the guinea to purcha&s;e a roll; as his &s;tomach was full of wind by exce&s;s of fa&s;t|ing, the fir&s;t mouthful choaked him, and in&s;tanta|neou&s;ly put a period to his days.</P>
<P>Who can con&s;ider the fate of this gentleman, without being moved to pity? we can forgive his acts of imprudence, &s;ince they brought him to &s;o mi&s;erable an end; and we cannot but regret, that he who was endowed by nature with &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed talents, as to make the bo&s;om bleed with &s;alutary &s;orrow, &s;hould him&s;elf be &s;o extremely wretched, as to excite the &s;ame &s;en&s;ations for him, which by the power of his eloquence and poetry, he had rai&s;ed for imaginary heroes. We know, indeed, of no guilty part of Otway's life, other than tho&s;e fa&s;hionable faults, which u&s;ually re|commend to the conver&s;ation of men in courts, but which &s;erve for excu&s;es for their patrons, when they have not a mind to provide for them. From the example of Mr. Otway, &s;ucceeding poets &s;hould learn not to place any confidence in the promi&s;es of patrons; it di&s;covers a higher &s;pi|rit, and reflects more honour on a man to &s;truggle nobly for independance, by the means of indu&s;try, than &s;ervilely to wait at a great man's gate, or to &s;it at his table, meerly to afford him diver&s;ion: Competence and independence have &s;urely more &s;ub&s;tantial charms, than the &s;miles of a courtier, which are too frequently fallacious. But who can read Mr. Otway's &s;tory, without indignation at tho&s;e idols of greatne&s;s, who demand wor&s;hip from men of genius, and yet can &s;uffer them to live mi&s;era|bly, and die neglected?</P>

<ITEM>3. Friend&s;hip in Fa&s;hion, a Comedy, acted at the Duke's Theatre, 1678, dedicated to the Earl of Dor&s;et and Middle&s;ex. This play was revived at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, 1749, and was damned by the audience, on account of the immorality of the de&s;ign, and the ob&s;cenity of the dialogue.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Don Carlos, Prince of Spain, a Tragedy, acted at the Duke of York's Theatre, 1679. This play, which was the &s;econd production of our au|thor, written in heroic ver&s;e, was acted with very great applau&s;e, and had a run of thirty nights; the plot from the Novel called Don-Carlos.</ITEM>

<HEAD>JOHN OLDHAM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS eminent &s;atyrical poet, was the &s;on of the reverend Mr. John Oldham, a non|conformi&s;t mini&s;ter, and grand&s;on to Mr. John Oldham, rector of Nun-Eaton, near Tedbury in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire. He was born at Shipton (where his father had a congregation, near Tedbury, and in the &s;ame county) on the 9th of Augu&s;t 1653. He was educated in grammar learning, under the care of his father, till he was almo&s;t fitted for the univer&s;ity; and to be compleatly qualified for that purpo&s;e, he was &s;ent to Tedbridge &s;chool, where he &s;pent about two years under the tuition of Mr. Henry Heaven, occa&s;ioned by the earne&s;t reque&s;t of alderman Yeats of Bri&s;tol, who having a &s;on at the &s;ame &s;chool, was de&s;irous that Mr. Oldham &s;hould be his companion, which he imagined would much conduce to the ad|vancement of his learning. This for &s;ome time re|tarded Oldham in the pro&s;ecution of his own &s;tudies, but for the time he lo&s;t in forwarding Mr. Yeat's &s;on, his father afterwards made him an ample amends. Mr. Oldham being &s;ent to Edmund Hall in Oxford, was committed to the care of Mr. Wil|liam Stephens: of which hall he became a bachelor in the beginning of June 1670. He was &s;oon ob|&s;erved to be a good latin &s;cholar, and chiefly addicted him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of poetry, and other polite ac|quirements<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Mr. Oldham, prefixed to his works, vol. i. edit. Lond. 1722.</NOTE>. In the year 1674, he took the de|gree of bachelor of arts, but left the univer&s;ity be|fore
<PB N="338" REF="343">
he compleated that degree by determination, being much again&s;t his inclination compelled to go home and live for &s;ome time with his father. The next year he was very much afflicted for the death of his dear friend, and con&s;tant companion, Mr. Charles Mervent, as appears by his ode upon that occa&s;ion. In a &s;hort time after he became u&s;her to the free|&s;chool at Croyden in Surry. Here it was, he had the honour of receiving a vi&s;it from the earl of Ro|che&s;ter, the earl of Dor&s;et, Sir Charles Sedley, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, meerly upon the reputa|tion of &s;ome ver&s;es which they had &s;een in manu|&s;cript. The ma&s;ter of the &s;chool was not a little &s;urprized, at &s;uch a vi&s;it, and would fain have taken the honour of it to him&s;elf, but was &s;oon convinced that he had neither wit nor learning enough to make a party in &s;uch company. This adventure was no doubt very happy for Mr. Oldham, as it encrea&s;ed his reputation and gained him the countenance of the Great, for after about three years continuance at Croyden &s;chool, he was recommended by his good friend Harman Atwood, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to Sir Edward Thur|land, a judge, near Rygate in the &s;ame county, who appointed him tutor to his two grand&s;ons. He con|tinued in this family till 1680. After this he was &s;ometime tutor to a &s;on of Sir William Hicks, a gentleman living within three or four miles of Lon|don, who was intimately acquainted with a cele|brated Phy&s;ician, Dr. Richard Lower, by who&s;e peculiar friend&s;hip and encouragement, Mr. Oldham at his lei&s;ure hours &s;tudied phy&s;ic for about a year, and made &s;ome progre&s;s in it, but the bent of his poetical genius was too &s;trong to become a pro|ficient in any &s;chool but that of the mu&s;es. He freely acknowledges this in a letter to a friend, written in July 1678.<Q><PB N="339" REF="344"><L>While &s;illy I, all thriving arts refu&s;e,</L>

But among&s;t the Men of quality he was mo&s;t affectionately care&s;&s;ed by William Earl of King&s;ton, who made him an offer of becoming his chaplain; but he declined an em|ployment, to which &s;ervility and dependence are &s;o nece&s;&s;arily connected.

<P>The above is a lively and animated de&s;cription of the mi&s;eries of a &s;lavi&s;h dependance on the great, particularly that kind of mortification which a chap|lain mu&s;t undergo. It is to be lamented, that gentlemen of an academical education &s;hould be &s;ub|jected to ob&s;erve &s;o great a di&s;tance from tho&s;e, over whom in all points of learning and genius they may have a &s;uperiority. Tho' in the very nature of things this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily happen, yet a high &s;pirit can|not bear it, and it is with plea&s;ure we can produce Oldham, as one of tho&s;e poets who have &s;purned dependence, and acted con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of his genius, and the lu&s;tre of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the earl of King&s;ton found that Mr. Old|ham's &s;pirit was too high to accept his offer of chap|lain&s;hip, he then care&s;&s;ed him as a companion, and gave him an invitation to his hou&s;e at Holmes-Pier|pont, in Nottingham&s;hire. This invitation Mr. Oldham accepted, and went into the country with him, not as a dependant but friend; he con&s;idered him&s;elf as a poet, and a clergyman, and in con&s;e|quence of that, he did not imagine the earl was in the lea&s;t degraded by making him his bo&s;om com|panion. Virgil was the friend of Maecenas, and &s;hone in the court of Augu&s;tus, and if it &s;hould be ob&s;erved that Virgil was a greater poet than Oldham, it may be an&s;wered, Maecenas was a greater man than
<PB N="342" REF="347">
the Earl of King&s;ton, and the court of Augu&s;tus much more brilliant than that of Charles II.</P>

In the &s;econd volume of the great hi&s;tori|cal, geographical, and poetical Dictionary, he is &s;tiled the Darling of the Mu&s;es, a pithy, &s;ententious, elegant, and &s;mooth writer: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"His tran&s;lations ex|ceed the original, and his invention &s;eems match|le&s;s.

<HEAD>(DILLON) (WENTWORTH) Earl of ROSCOMMON,</HEAD>
<P>THIS nobleman was born in Ireland during the lieutenancy of the earl of Straf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ord, in the reign of King Charles I. Lord Strafford was his godfather, and named him by his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">irname. He pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome of his fir&s;t years in his native coun|try, till the earl of Strafford imagining, when the rebellion fir&s;t broke out, that his father who had been converted by archbi&s;hop U&s;her to the Prote&s;tant re|ligion, would be expo&s;ed to great danger, and be unable to protect his family, &s;ent for his god&s;on, and placed him at his own &s;eat in York&s;hire, under the tuition of Dr. Hall. afterwards bi&s;hop of Norwich; by whom he was in&s;tructed in Latin, and without learning the common rules of grammar, which he could never retain in his memory, he attained to write in that language with cla&s;&s;ical elegance and propriety, and with &s;o much ea&s;e, that he cho&s;e it to corre&s;pond with tho&s;e friends who had learning &s;ufficient to &s;upport the commerce. When the earl of Strafford was pro&s;ecuted, lord Ro&s;common went to Caen in Normandy, by the advice of bi&s;hop U&s;her, to continue his &s;tudies under Bochart, where he is &s;aid to have had an extraordinary impul&s;e of his father's death, which is related by Mr. Au|brey in his mi&s;cellany, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Our author then a boy of about ten years of age, one day was as it were madly extravagant, in playing, getting over the tables, boards, &amp;c. He was wont to be &s;ober e|nough. They who ob&s;erved him &s;aid, God grant
<PB N="345" REF="350">
this proves no ill luck to him. In the heat of this extravagant fit, he cries out my father is dead. A fortnight after news came from Ireland, that his father was dead. This account I had from Mr. Knowles who was his governor, and then with him, &s;ince &s;ecretary to the earl of Strafford; and I have heard his lord&s;hip's relations confirm the &s;ame.'</Q></P>
<P>The ingenious author of lord Ro&s;common's life, publi&s;h'd in the Gentleman's Magazine for the month of May, 1748, has the following remarks on the above relation of Aubrey's. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'The pre&s;ent age is very little inclined to favour any accounts of this &s;ort, nor will the name of Aubrey much recommend it to credit; it ought not however to be omitted, becau&s;e better evi|dence of a fact is not ea&s;ily to be found, than is here offered, and it mu&s;t be, by pre&s;erving &s;uch relations, that we may at lea&s;t judge how much they are to be regarded. If we &s;tay to examine this account we &s;hall find difficulties on both &s;ides; here is a relation of a fact given by a man who had no intere&s;t to deceive him&s;elf; and here is on the other hand a miracle which produ|ces no effect; the order of nature is interrupted to di&s;cover not a future, but only a di&s;tant event, the knowledge of which is of no u&s;e to him to whom it is revealed. Between the&s;e difficulties what way &s;hall be found? Is rea&s;on or te&s;timony to be re|jected? I believe what O&s;borne &s;ays of an appear|ance of &s;anctity, may be applied to &s;uch impul&s;es, or anticipations. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Do not wholly &s;light them, becau&s;e they may be true; but do not ea&s;ily tru&s;t them, becau&s;e they may be fal&s;e."</Q></P></Q> </P>
<P>Some years after he travelled to Rome, where he grew familiar with the mo&s;t valuable remains of an|tiquity, applying him&s;elf particularly to the know|ledge
<PB N="346" REF="351">
of medals, which he gained in great perfection, and &s;poke Italian with &s;o much grace and fluency, that he was frequently mi&s;taken there for a native. He returned to England upon the re&s;toration of King Charles the IId, and was made captain of the band of pen&s;ioners, an honour which tempted him to &s;ome ext<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">avagancies. In the gaieties of that age (&s;ays Fenton) he was tempted to indulge a violent pa&s;&s;ion for gaming, by which he &s;requently hazarded his life in duels, and exceeded the bounds of a moderate fortune. This was the fate of many other men who&s;e genius was of no other advantage to them, than that it recommended them to employments, or to di&s;tinction, by which the temptations to vice were multiplied, and their parts became &s;oon of no other u&s;e, than that of enabling them to &s;ucceed in debau|ehery.</P>
<P>A di&s;pute about part of his e&s;tate, obliging him to return to Ireland, he re&s;igned his po&s;t, and upon his arrival at Dublin, was made captain of the guards to the duke of Ormond.</P>
<P>When he was at Dublin he was as much as ever di&s;tempered with the &s;ame fatal affection for play, which engaged him in one adventure, which well de&s;erves to be related. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'As he returned to his lodgings from a gaming table, he was attacked in the dark by three ruffians, who were employed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him. The earl defended him&s;elf with &s;o much re&s;olution, that he di&s;patched one of the aggre&s;&s;ors, while a gentleman accidentally pa&s;&s;ing that way interpo&s;ed, and di&s;armed another; the third &s;ecured him&s;elf by flight. This generous a&s;&s;i&s;tant was a di&s;banded officer of a good fami|ly and fair reputation; who by what we call partiality of fortune, to avoid cen&s;uring the ini|quities of the times, wanted even a plain &s;uit of clothes to make a decent appearance at the ca&s;tle; but his lord&s;hip on this occa&s;ion pre&s;enting him to the duke of Ormond, with great importunity pre|vailed
<PB N="347" REF="352">
with his grace that he might re&s;ign his po&s;t of captain of the guards to his friend, which for about three years the gentleman enjoyed, and up|on his death, the duke returned the commi&s;&s;ion to his generous benefactor.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fenton.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>His lord&s;hip having fini&s;hed his affairs in Ire|land, he returned to London, was made ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e to the dutche&s;s of York, and married the lady Frances, elde&s;t daughter of the earl of Bur|lington, and widow of colonel Courtnay.</P>
<P>About this time, in imitation of tho&s;e learned and polite a&s;&s;emblies, with which he had been acquainted abroad; particularly one at Caen, (in which his tutor Bochartus died &s;uddenly while he was delivering an oration) he began to form a &s;ociety for refining and fixing the &s;tandard of our language. In this de&s;ign, his great friend Mr. Dryden was a particular a&s;&s;i&s;|tant; a de&s;ign, &s;ays Fenton, of which it is much more ea&s;y to conceive an agreeable idea, than any rational hope ever to &s;ee it brought to perfection. This excellent de&s;ign was again &s;et on foot, under the mini&s;try of the earl of Oxford, and was again defeated by a conflict of parties, and the nece&s;&s;ity of attending only to political di&s;qui&s;itions, for defending the conduct of the admini&s;tration, and forming par|ties in the Parliament. Since that time it has never been mentioned, either becau&s;e it has been hitherto a &s;ufficient objection, that it was one of the de&s;igns of the earl of Oxford, by whom Godolphin was de|feated; or becau&s;e the &s;tate&s;men who &s;ucceeded him have not more lei&s;ure, and perhaps le&s;s ta&s;te for li|terary improvements. Lord Ro&s;common's attempts were fru&s;trated by the commotions which were pro|duced by King James's endeavours to introduce al|terations
<PB N="348" REF="353">
in religion. He re&s;olved to retire to Rome, alledging, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'it was be&s;t to &s;it next the chimney when the chamber &s;moaked.'</Q></P>
<P>It will, no doubt, &s;urprize many of the pre|&s;ent age, and be a ju&s;t cau&s;e of triumph to them, if they find that what Ro&s;common and Oxford attempted in vain, &s;hall be carried into execu|tion, in the mo&s;t ma&s;terly manner, by a private gentleman, una&s;&s;i&s;ted, and unpen&s;ioned. The world has ju&s;t rea&s;on to hope this from the publication of an Engli&s;h Dictionary, long expected, by Mr. John&s;on; and no doubt a de&s;ign of this &s;ort, ex|ecuted by &s;uch a genius, will be a la&s;ting monu|ment of the nation's honour, and that writer's merit.</P>
<P>Lord Ro&s;common's intended retreat into Italy, already mentioned, on account of the troubles in James the IId's reign, was prevented by the gout, of which he was &s;o impatient, that he admitted a repellent application from a French empyric, by which his di&s;temper was driven up into his bowels, and put an end to his life, in 1684.</P>
<P>Mr. Fenton has told us, that the moment in which he expired, he cried out with a voice, that ex|pre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t inten&s;e fervour of devotion,<Q><L>My God! my father, and my friend!</L>
<L>Do not for&s;ake me, at my end.</L></Q></P>
<P>Two lines of his own ver&s;ion of the hymn, Dies irae, Dies illa.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Mr. Fenton, in his notes upon Waller, has given Ro&s;common a character too general to be criti|cally ju&s;t. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'In his writings, &s;ays he, we view the image of a mind, which was naturally &s;erious and &s;olid, richly furni&s;hed, and adorned with all the orna|ments of art and &s;cience; and tho&s;e ornaments
<PB N="349" REF="354">
unaffectedly di&s;po&s;ed in the mo&s;t regular and ele|gant order. His imagination might have proba|bly been fruitful and &s;prightly, if his judgment had been le&s;s &s;evere; but that &s;everity (delivered in a ma&s;culine, clear, &s;uccinct &s;tile) contributed to make him &s;o eminent in the didactical manner, that no man with ju&s;tice can affirm he was ever e|qualled by any of our nation, without confe&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time, that he is inferior to none. In &s;ome other kinds of writing his genius &s;eems to have wanted fire to attain the point of perfec|tion: but who can attain it?'</Q></P>
<P>From this account of the riches of his mind, who would not imagine that they had been di&s;|played in large volumes, and numerous per&s;or|mandes? Who would not, after the peru&s;al of this character, be &s;urprized to find, that all the proofs of this genius, and knowledge and judgment, are not &s;ufficient to form a &s;mall volume? But thus it is, that characters are generally written: We know &s;omewhat, and we imagine the re&s;t. The ob&s;ervation that his ima|gination would have probably been more fruitful and &s;prightly, if his judgment had been le&s;s &s;evere; might, if we were inclined to cavil, be an&s;wer'd by a contrary &s;uppo&s;ition, that his judgment would have been le&s;s &s;evere, if his imagination had been more fruitful. It is ridiculous to oppo&s;e judgment and imagination to each other; for it does not appear, that men have nece&s;&s;arily le&s;s of the one, as they have more of the other.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t allow, in favour of lord Ro&s;common, what Fenton has not mentioned &s;o di&s;tinctly as he ought, and what is yet very much to his honour, That he is perhaps the only correct writer in ver&s;e before Addi&s;on; and that if there are not &s;o ma|ny beauties in his compo&s;ition, as in tho&s;e of &s;ome of his contemporaries, there are at lea&s;t fewer faults. Nor is this his highe&s;t prai&s;e; for
<PB N="350" REF="355">
Mr. Pope has celebrated him as the only moral writer in Charles the IId's reign.<Q><L>Unhappy Dryden&mdash;in all Charles's days,</L>
<L>Ro&s;common only boa&s;ts un&s;potted lays.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Dryden &s;peaking of Ro&s;common's e&s;&s;ay on tran&s;lated ver&s;e, has the following ob&s;ervation: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'It was that, &s;ays he, that made me unea&s;y, till I tried whether or no I was capable of following his rules, and of reducing the &s;pecu|lation into practice. For many a fair precept in poetry, is like a &s;eeming demon&s;tration in mathematics: very &s;pecious in the diagram, but failing in mechanic operation. I think I have generally ob&s;erved his in&s;tructions. I am &s;ure my rea&s;on is &s;ufficiently convinced both of their truth and u&s;efulne&s;s; which in other words is to confe&s;s no le&s;s a vanity, than to pretend that I have at lea&s;t in &s;ome places made ex|amples to his rules.'</Q></P>
<P>This declaration of Dryden will be found no more than one of tho&s;e cur&s;ory civilities, which one author pays to another; and that kind of compliment for which Dryden was remark|able. For when the &s;um of lord Ro&s;com|mon's precepts is collected, it will not be ea&s;y to di&s;cover how they can qualify their reader for a better performance of tran&s;lation, than might might have been attained by his own re|flexions.</P>
<P>They are however here laid down:<Q><LG>
<L>'Tis true compo&s;ing is the nobler part,</L>

<P>Nothing could have induced us to have labour|ed thro' &s;o great a number of cold un&s;pirited lines, but in order to &s;hew, that the rules which my lord has laid down are meerly common place, and mu&s;t unavoidably occur to the mind of the mo&s;t ordinary reader. They contain no more than this; that the author &s;hould be &s;uitable to the tran&s;lator's genius; that he &s;hould be &s;uch as may de&s;erve a tran&s;lation; that he who intends to tran&s;late him, &s;hould endeavour to under&s;tand him; that per&s;picuity &s;hould be &s;tudied, and unu&s;ual or uncouth names, &s;paringly in&s;erted; and that the &s;tile of the original &s;hould be copied in its elevation and depre&s;&s;ion.

<P>Among&s;t the MSS. of Mr. Coxeter, we found lord Ro&s;common's tran&s;lation of Horace's Art of Poetry, with &s;ome &s;ketches of alterations he intended to make; but they are not great improvements; and this tran&s;lation, of all his lord&s;hip's pieces, is the mo&s;t unpoetical.</P>
