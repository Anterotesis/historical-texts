<L>LA&s;t of the months, &s;evere&s;t of them all,</L>

<L>And Winter on a Goat be&s;trides the gale;</L>
<L>Rough blows the north wind near Arcturus' &s;tar,</L>
<L>And &s;weeps, unrein'd, acro&s;s the polar bar,</L>
<L>On the world's confines, where the &s;ea-bears prowl,</L>
<L>And Greenland whales, like moving i&s;lands, roll:</L>

<L>Thy flooding deluge, and thy drenching &s;hower;</L>
<L>Yes&mdash;we acknowledge what thy prowe&s;s can,</L>

<L>The pea&s;ants to thy mercy now re&s;ign</L>
<L>The infant &s;eed&mdash;their hope and future mine:</L>
<L>Not always Phoebus bends his vengeful bow,</L>
<L>Oft in mid winter placid breezes blow,</L>
<L>Oft tinctur'd with the blue&s;t tran&s;marine,</L>
<L>The fretted canopy of heaven is &s;een;</L>

<L>O Could my Mu&s;e, with gentle Gay,</L>
<L>Upon the boxen hautboy play,</L>
<L>Or, with &s;weet pipe of &s;hepherd's boy,</L>
<L>Make Wind&s;or's &s;hades re&s;ound with joy,</L>
<L>Maria's beauties &s;till &s;hould live,</L>

<L>Eliza's love, Eliza's truth,</L>
<L>Unfading bloom in endle&s;s youth,</L>
<L>And every bright delicious charm</L>
<L>The barbed hand of Time di&s;arm;</L>

<L>Our brow&s;ing cattle &s;eek the cooling rill,</L>

<L>What boots it, Colin, that our limbs are laid,</L>
<L>Compos'd, beneath the oak's refre&s;hing &s;hade,</L>
<L><PB N="76" REF="78">Or that around us, on the yellow plain,</L>
<L>The fertile ground is &s;tock'd with plenteous grain?</L>

<L>Can &s;hades or plenty, or delightful views,</L>
<L>O'er wounded minds the &s;miles of joy diffu&s;e?</L>

<L>Happy in love, and &s;tranger to my woes,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which your life with tran&s;ports crown,</L>
<L>Four moons agone I boa&s;ted as my own;</L>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<L>And who that knew the lovely nymph forbears</L>
<L>The willing tribute of condoling tears?</L>
<L>Bright was her form, with graces richly deck'd,</L>
<L>Commanding love, attemper'd with re&s;pect;</L>
<L>Sweet Mode&s;ty, with &s;ocial Freedom join'd,</L>
<L>Her manners form'd, and wit adorn'd her mind:</L>
<L>How kind! how courteous &s;he to every &s;wain!</L>
<L>My wounded memory recollects with pain;</L>

In the year 1740, in con&s;ideration of his merit, he was placed fir&s;t in the li&s;t of tho&s;e &s;cholars who are elected from Winche&s;ter college to New college in Oxford: but no vacancy happening at the latter, he was entered, the &s;ame year, a commoner of Queen's college, Ox. and July 29, 1741. was elected a demy, or &s;cholar, of Magdalen college in the &s;ame univer&s;ity. At &s;chool he began to &s;tudy poetry and critici&s;m, particularly the latter. The fol|lowing epigram, made by him while at Win|che&s;ter-&s;chool, di&s;covers a genius, and turn of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, very rarely to be met with in juvenile compo&s;itions.</P>

<HEAD>TO MISS AURELIA C&mdash;R, ON HER WEEPING AT HER SISTER'S WEDDING.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>CEa&s;e, fair Aurelia, cea&s;e to mourn;</L>
<L>Lament not Hannah's happy &s;tate;</L>
<L>You may be happy in your turn,</L>
<L>And &s;eize the trea&s;ure you regret.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With Love united Hymen &s;tands,</L>
<L>And &s;oftly whi&s;pers to your charms;</L>
<L>" Meet but your lover in my bands,</L>
<L>" You'll find your &s;i&s;ter in his arms."</L>

<P>His Latin exerci&s;es were never &s;o much admired as his Engli&s;h.&mdash;At Oxford he wrote the epi&s;tle to Sir Thomas Hanmer, and Oriental eclogues, which were fir&s;t publi&s;hed in 1742, under the title of Per&s;ian eclogues. About the year 1743, he left Oxford, having taken the degree of bachelor of arts, weary of the confinement and uniformity of an academical life; fondly imagining that a man of parts was &s;ure of making his fortune in London; and &s;truck with the name of author and poet, without con&s;ulting his friends, he imme|diately removed to town, and ra&s;hly re&s;olved to
<PB N="109" REF="111">
live by his pen, without undertaking the drudgery of any profe&s;&s;ion. Here he &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated his &s;mall fortune, to compen&s;ate for which, he pro|jected the hi&s;tory of the revival of learning in Italy, under the pontificates of Julius II. and Leo X. His &s;ub&s;cription for this work not an&s;wering his expectations, he engaged with a book&s;eller, to tran&s;late Ari&s;totle's Poetics, and to illu&s;trate it with a large and regular comment. This &s;cheme al&s;o being laid a&s;ide, he turn'd his thoughts to dra|matic poetry, and being intimately acquainted with the manager, re&s;olved to write a tragedy, which however he never executed. In the year 1746 he publi&s;hed his odes; and &s;hortly after went abroad to our army in Flanders, to attend his uncle, colonel Martin, who, dying &s;oon after his arrival, left him a con&s;iderable fortune; which however he did not live long to enjoy, for he fell into a nervous di&s;order, which continued, with but &s;hort intervals, till his death, which happened in 1756. and with which di&s;order his head and intellects were at times affected.</P>
<P>For a man of &s;uch an elevated genius, Mr. Collins has wrote but little: his time was chiefly taken up in laying exten&s;ive projects, and va&s;t de|&s;igns, which he never even begun to put in execution.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112">We have been favoured with the following ac|count of Mr. Collins by a gentleman, de&s;ervedly eminent in the republic of letters, who knew him intimately well.</P>
<P>Mr. Collins was a man of exten&s;ive literature, and of vigorous faculties. He was acquainted not only with the learned tongues, but with the Italian, French, and Spani&s;h languages. He had employed his mind chiefly upon works of fiction, and &s;ubjects of fancy; and, by indulging &s;ome peculiar habits of thought, was eminently delighted with tho&s;e flights of imagination which pa&s;s the bounds of nature, and to which the mind is reconciled only by a pa&s;&s;ive acquie&s;cence in popular traditions. He loved fairies, genii, giants, and mon&s;ters; he delighted to rove through the meanders of inchant|ment, to gaze on the magnificence of golden pa|laces, to repo&s;e by the waterfals of Ely&s;ian gar|dens. This was however the character rather of his inclination than his genius, the grandeur of wildne&s;s, and the novelty of extravagance, were always de&s;ired by him, but were not always at|tained. But diligence is never wholly lo&s;t: if his efforts &s;ometimes cau&s;ed har&s;hne&s;s and ob&s;cu|rity, they likewi&s;e produced in happier moments &s;ublimity and &s;plendour. This idea, which he had formed of excellence, led him to oriental fictions, and allegorical imagery; and, perhaps,
<PB N="111" REF="113">
while he was intent upon de&s;cription, he did not &s;ufficiently cultivate &s;entiment: his poems are the productions of a mind not deficient in fire, nor unfurni&s;hed with knowledge either of books or life, but &s;omewhat ob&s;tructed in its progre&s;s, by deviation in que&s;t of mi&s;taken beauties.</P>
<P>His morals were pure, and his opinions pious. In a long continuance of poverty, and long habits of di&s;&s;ipation, it cannot be expected that any cha|racter &s;hould be exactly uniform. There is a degree of want by which the freedom of agency is almo&s;t de&s;troyed, and long a&s;&s;ociation with for|tuitous companions will at la&s;t relax the &s;trictne&s;s of truth, and abate the fervour of &s;incerity. That this man, wi&s;e and virtuous as he was, pa&s;&s;ed always unentangled through the &s;nares of life, it would be prejudice and temerity to affirm. But it may be &s;aid, that at lea&s;t he pre&s;erved the &s;ource of action unpolluted, that his principles were never &s;haken, that his di&s;tinctions of right and wrong were never confounded, and that his faults had nothing of malignity or de&s;ign, but proceeded from &s;ome unexpected pre&s;&s;ure, or ca&s;ual temptation.</P>
<P>The latter part of his life cannot be remembred but with pity and &s;adne&s;s. He langui&s;hed &s;ome years under that depre&s;&s;ion of mind which en|chains the faculties without de&s;troying them,
<PB N="112" REF="114">
and leaves rea&s;on the knowledge of right, with|out the power of pur&s;uing it. The&s;e clouds, which he found gathering on his intellects, he endeavoured to di&s;per&s;e by travel, and pa&s;&s;ed into France, but found him&s;elf con&s;trained to yield to his malady, and returned: he was for &s;ome time confined in a hou&s;e of lunatics, and afterwards retired to the care of his &s;i&s;ter in Colche&s;ter, where death at la&s;t came to his relief.</P>
<P>After his return from France, the writer of this character paid him a vi&s;it at Islington, where he was waiting for his &s;i&s;ter, whom he had directed to meet him: there was then nothing of di&s;order di&s;cernable in his mind by any but him&s;elf, but he had then withdrawn from &s;tudy, and travelled with no other book than an Engli&s;h te&s;tament, &s;uch as children carry to the &s;chool; when his friend took it into his hand, out of curio&s;ity to &s;ee what companion a man of letters had cho&s;en, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have but one book," &s;ays Collins, "but that is the be&s;t."</Q></P>
