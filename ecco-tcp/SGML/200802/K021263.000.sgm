<HEAD>TO DAVID GARRICK, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>DEDICATIONS are generally meant to to do honour to the Patron, by revealing their private virtues, or recording their public merits. But neither of the&s;e &s;ubjects occa&s;ion|ed the pre&s;ent addre&s;s; for while the undivided applau&s;e of a nation, proclaims the latter, my &s;mall plaudit mu&s;t be lo&s;t, in the general voice; and while the friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, of &s;o many of the fir&s;t per&s;onages of the age, are, at once, the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timony, and mo&s;t plea&s;ing re|ward, of the former, my &s;imple concurrence mu&s;t be deemed &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>To neither of the&s;e motives, then, is to be attributed my publicly placing this play, un|der

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE hint of this comedy was taken from a much admired performance of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Beaumarchais,</HI> &s;tiled <HI>Eugenie,</HI> which Mr. Garrick was &s;o kind to put into my hands, &s;ome time ago. I was immediately &s;truck with the elegant &s;implicity of language, and &s;entiment, which cha|racterizes that work, and which, indeed, &s;hould do the &s;ame, in all dramatic writings, where neither the per&s;ons, or &s;ituations of the drama, are elevated above the common degrees of life.</P>
<P>I immediately adopted the plan, and &s;et about adapting it to the Engli&s;h Stage. But, as I proceeded in this work, I found I had great difficulties to encounter; for, though Mon&s;. <HI>Beaumarchais</HI> had laid the &s;cene of his play, in Eng|land, he had, unluckily, adopted Spani&s;h manners. This circum&s;tance appeared an un&s;urmountable ob&s;lacle to me, and I &s;hould have immediately relinqui&s;hed all hopes from my project, if Mr Garrick had not, in the mo&s;t friendly manner, lent me his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to overcome this otherwi&s;e in&s;uperable difficulty.</P>
<P>How far I have &s;ucceeded, in rendering this piece worthy of the Engli&s;h &s;tage, mu&s;t be left to the candor of the public. I &s;hall only add, that the characters of <HI>Frampton, Willis, Loyd,</HI> I may add Mrs. <HI>Winifred,</HI> al&s;o, are of Engli&s;h growth. The character of Lord <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> too, has receiv'd &s;ome additions; and I hope that his compunction, for the crime he had committed, will render him more worthy the favour of a Briti&s;h audience, who&s;e generous natures can|not brook the repre&s;entation of any vice, upon the &s;tage, except in order to have it puni&s;hed, or reclaimed. As the &s;ituation of <HI>Harriet</HI> would not admit of any change, I have not attempted to deviate from the gentle, and inte|re&s;ting <HI>Eugenie,</HI> of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Beaumarchais.</HI></P>
<P>I had written thus far, before I could have been in|formed of the very kind and favourable reception, with
<PB REF="5">
which the public have honoured this piece; and I think my&s;elf extremely happy, at having this opportunity of a&s;&s;uring them, that I &s;hall ever retain the mo&s;t grateful &s;en&s;e of their indulgence to me.</P>
<P>I am particularly bound to Mrs. Clive, on this occa&s;ion, who undertook the &s;tudy of a new part, at a time when &s;he had determined to quit the &s;tage, and who&s;e kindne&s;s to the author, and attention to the public, made her hazard her health, by performing it&mdash;I need not &s;ay how well&mdash;when her phy&s;icians would have confined her to her chamber.</P>
<P>I acknowledge my&s;elf al&s;o much obliged to the re&s;t of the performers in my play, for having acquitted them&s;elves &s;o much to the advantage of the piece, and the approbation of the public; to whom I have the honour to be,</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, but I am quite of opinion, they will &s;oon be gone again, at lea&s;t out of this hou&s;e; for as I a&s;&s;i&s;ted in carrying in their trunks, and band-boxes, merely to contemplate their countenances, I cou'd perceive the &s;tronge&s;t marks of di&s;&s;atisfaction, in Sir William's face; and when the &s;ervants retir'd from the parlour, I overheard him, and his &s;i&s;ter Winifred, in high di&s;putation&mdash;Both their Welch bloods were up, and a fine &s;plut|ter there was, between them; but, tho' you might
<PB N="2" REF="11">
have heard them into Hyde-Park, they &s;poke &s;o quick, that I cou'd only pick up an odd word, here and there, as if Sir William did not like this part of the town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h they had &s;taid in the country, with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe there are more people of that mind, than you, Sir. I fancy my lord wou'd give a good round &s;um, that they had remained fixed to the freehold, at Langwillan.&mdash;Tho', to be &s;ure, Mi&s;s Harriet is, by many degrees, the hand&s;ome&s;t girl, that ever his lord&s;hip was fond of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t not, Willis, talk of her, in that &s;tile&mdash;She is a young woman, both of character, and family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better for her, Sir, if &s;he has a good family of her own, for I am pretty &s;ure &s;he never will belong to ours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t again de&s;ire you, Mr. Willis, not to &s;peak &s;o lightly, of this affair&mdash;the real friends of your lord, will not be much inclin'd to mirth, or ridicule, upon this occa&s;ion, I can tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>As we were both placed here, by my lord, to manage this matter for him, I thought there cou'd be no great harm, to argue, a little, upon it, Mr. Frampton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not, at pre&s;ent, in a humour for con|ver&s;ation.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir, another time will do, as well.</P>

<P>I wou'd have you go, immediately, and acquaint lord Eu&s;tace with their arrival&mdash;Let him al&s;o know, that I &s;hall wait upon the ladies, and make his apology, for not being here to receive them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have been very obliging to his lord|&s;hip, upon many &s;uch occa&s;ions, Mr. Frampton;
<PB N="3" REF="12">
but I fancy he never &s;tood more in need of your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and mine, too, than he does, at pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>Tho' in the &s;ame cau&s;e, I believe our &s;er|vices will tend to different purpo&s;es&mdash;I &s;hall not flatter his vices.</P>

<P>Lord, Mr. Frampton, you are grown &s;o prudi&s;h, of late!</P>

<P>You are grown too familiar, Mr. Willis.&mdash;You'll oblige me, and obey your lord's com|mands, at the &s;ame time, by going, directly, with the me&s;&s;age I de&s;ired you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not mean to offend you, Sir, by ob&s;erving how u&s;eful your friend&s;hip has been to my lord.&mdash;Has your honour any farther com|mands?</P>

<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>None, but tho&s;e I gave you.</P>

<P>Here's more to do, with the&s;e &s;habby, ruin'd, hangers-on, of my lord's, than all the family, be&s;ide.&mdash;I think my&s;elf as good a man as he, and if he had not a little too much &s;pirit for me, I wou'd tell him as much.</P>

<P>To what a &s;tate, have I reduced my&s;elf, when even &s;uch a wretch as that, dares to upbraid me!

A ruin'd fortune, a di&s;turb'd mind, and a broken con&s;titution, are the only mementos that are now left me&mdash;Yet, I think I have fortitude &s;ufficient, to bear all the&s;e&mdash;but to be obliged to mini&s;ter to another man's vices, for a wretched &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, is to degrade human nature, below the brutes.&mdash;Thank heaven, however, I have e&s;cap'd being concern'd in this iniquitous affair; and tho' my friend&s;hip for lord Eu&s;tace, will not &s;uffer me to de&s;ert him, in his pre&s;ent difficulties, I am de|termin'd

<P>A pretty alliance, truly, for my niece, and your daughter. But let me tell you, Sir, if Harriet had not a &s;hilling, her family and her beauty wou'd intitle her to a much better match, than your colonel; who has nothing but an old tottering ca&s;tle, a &s;carlet coat, and a &s;word, to &s;ettle, by way of jointure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your ab&s;urdity di&s;tracts me. What has your family and beauty done for you? And I dare &s;ay, you once rated them as high, as you do Har|riet's.</P>

<P>You'll pardon me, brother, I under|&s;tand genealogy better, than &s;o&mdash;tho' there is not a very great difference, between my niece's years, and mine, &s;he has one generation more, in her table, than I; which, let me tell you, is of no &s;mall con|&s;equence, to tho&s;e who know how to &s;et a proper value, upon family.</P>

<P>Family! Non&s;en&s;e! Let tho&s;e who have no other merit to &s;upport them, build on that; but, know, that I de&s;pi&s;e it; and to make an end of this ridiculous altercation, for ever, I &s;hall inform you, that eight years ago, when Harriet was but a child, and the colonel was &s;ent young abroad,
<PB N="9" REF="18">
to &s;erve his country, I liked him &s;o well, that I promi&s;ed his father, if the young fellow return'd, with life, and honour, my daughter &s;hou'd be his.</P>

<P>Perhaps, his, and your father, my lord Delville, Harriet, may have claimed his lord|&s;hip's attendance.

<P>You &s;hall hear&mdash;That villain Lang|wood, my father's &s;teward, who per&s;uaded me into this &s;ham marriage, and per&s;onated the clergyman, on that occa&s;ion, is now dying, and writes me word that he is di&s;tracted, with the horrors of his con&s;ci|ence, and is determined to a&s;k the young lady's for|givene&s;s&mdash;a letter from him, to the family, wou'd di&s;cover all.</P>

<SP>

<P>You mu&s;t remain in this hou&s;e, and take care that my &s;ervants prevent their receiving any letters, without bringing them fir&s;t to you. I will order Willis to intercept them.</P>

<P>He is fit for the office; but this is a very odious affair, my lord. However, I have promis'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, and if I can prevail upon my&s;elf, I will go &s;o far, as to prevent Langwood's ha&s;tening the cata&s;trophe, which I much fear will be a &s;ad one.</P>

<P>It will require a good deal of courage, my lord, to &s;upport the interview; for I really think, that an injured, innocent woman, is a very formi|dable object.&mdash;But tho' you may be brave enough, for the encounter, I mu&s;t prevent it, for the pre&s;ent, as I have but ju&s;t now apologized for your ab&s;ence,

<P>True, Frampton, true&mdash;and if young men, like my&s;elf, wou'd but calculate the pains and difficulties, which are the natural con&s;equences of vice, and how much they over-balance its tran&s;itory joys, they wou'd be &s;hocked at a traffic, where cer|tain lo&s;s mu&s;t be the reward of their indu&s;try.</P>

<P>The being &s;en&s;ible of our errors, is the fir&s;t &s;tep to amendment; for no man ever &s;ets &s;eri|ou&s;ly about getting out of debt, 'till he is thoroughly apprized of the va&s;t &s;um he owes.&mdash;But, come, my lord, let us retire, immediately; I hear &s;ome of the family in motion&mdash;this way, quickly.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of a great deal, I fancy, Sir. There are numbers of people come here, after his lord. A fine lady, ju&s;t now, wanted to gain admittance, but Mr. Willis had dacity enough to make her di&s;be|lieve her own &s;en&s;es, and per&s;uaded her that his ma&s;ter was down at Bri&s;tol, tho' &s;he &s;aid her eyes &s;aw him come into the hou&s;e.

But why &s;hould Harriet be affected with it? Her aunt's folly may have operated there, al&s;o; perhaps per&s;uaded her, that his lord&s;hip's common addre&s;s of galantry and politene&s;s, was a profe&s;s'd declaration of pa&s;&s;ion for her.

<P>Nay, as to the matter of &s;urprize, my young hero, your father was quite as much a&s;toni&s;h'd, at hearing of your being in the &s;ame port, as you can be; and as to your aunt Winifred, &s;he &s;tarted, with as much amazement, as the &s;ailors that &s;pied the fir&s;t Patagonian.

laugh at the&s;e things, Harry; but I find you are a truer lover, and have come here, in &s;pite of wind and tide, in pur&s;uit of your mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;You can't expect, however, that Sir William will be highly delighted, if you &s;hou'd happen to make a lo&s;ing voyage of it.</P>

<P>She is a maiden, young, and beautiful, and of a rank and fortune, beyond my expectation, captain.

<P>Why, Harry! this is running before the wind, with a vengeance&mdash;Not &s;o fa&s;t, not &s;o fa&s;t, my boy, you go at the rate of twelve knots, an hour&mdash;This &s;tory &s;ounds a little romantic, tho', and puts me in mind of the lady, that the flying man comes to &s;ave from the mon&s;ter.&mdash;But 'tis odd enough, that I &s;hou'd not know this lady; prithee, Harry, what's her name?</P>

<P>Why, to be &s;ure, if &s;he had applied to me, &s;he &s;hou'd have been far enough from her guardians, by this, we'd have run gunnel to, all the way, my
