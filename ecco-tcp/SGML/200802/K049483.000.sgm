<P>IF tho&s;e Cares in which the Service of a Great QUEEN, and the Love of Your Country, have &s;o ju&s;tly Engag'd Your Lord&s;hip, would allow any Lei&s;ure to run back and remember tho&s;e Arts and Studies, which were once the Grace and Entertainment of
<PB REF="4">
Your Lord&s;hip's Youth; I have Pre|&s;umption enough to hope, that this Tragedy may, &s;ome Time or other, find an Hour to Divert Your Lord&s;hip. Poe|try, which was &s;o venerable to former Ages, as in many Places to make a Part of their Religious Wor&s;hip, and every where to be had in the highe&s;t Honour and E&s;teem, has mi&s;erably langui&s;h'd and been de&s;pis'd, for want of that Fa|vour and Protection which it found in the Famous <HI>Augu&s;tan</HI> Age. Since then, it may be a&s;&s;erted, without any Partiali|ty to the Pre&s;ent Time, it never had a fairer Pro&s;pect of lifting up its Head, and returning to its former Reputation, than now: And the be&s;t Rea&s;on can be given for it, is, that it &s;eems to have a par|ticular Hope from, and Dependance upon Your Lord&s;hip, and to expect all ju&s;t Encouragement, when tho&s;e Great Men, who have the Power to Protect it, have &s;o Delicate and Polite a Ta&s;te and Under&s;tanding of its True Value. The Re&s;toring and Pre&s;erving any Part of Learning is &s;o Generous an Action in it
<PB REF="5">
&s;elf, that it naturally falls into Your Lord&s;hip's Province, &s;ince every Thing that may &s;erve to Improve the Mind, has a Right to the Patronage of &s;o Great and Univer&s;al a Genius for Knowledge as Your Lord&s;hip's. It is indeed a Piece of good Fortune, upon which I cannot help Congratulating the pre&s;ent Age, that there is &s;o Great a Man, at a Time when there is &s;o great an Occa&s;ion for him. The Divi&s;ions which Your Lord|&s;hip has heal'd, the Temper which You have re&s;tor'd to our Councils, and that indefatigable Care and Diligence which You have us'd in pre&s;erving our Peace at Home, are Benefits &s;o virtuou&s;ly and &s;o &s;ea&s;onably conferr'd upon Your Coun|try, as &s;hall draw the Prai&s;es of all Wi&s;e Men, and the Ble&s;&s;ings of all Good Men upon Your Lord&s;hip's Name. And when tho&s;e unrea&s;onable Feuds and A|nimo&s;ities, which keep Faction alive, &s;hall be bury'd in &s;ilence and forgotten, that great Publick Good &s;hall be uni|ver&s;ally acknowledg'd, as the Happy Effect of Your Lord&s;hip's mo&s;t Equal

Temper and Right Under&s;tanding. That this Glorious End may very &s;uddenly &s;ucceed to Your Lord&s;hip's Candor and Generous Endeavours after it, mu&s;t be the Wi&s;h of every good <HI>Engli&s;h|man.</HI></P>

<L>TO Night, in Honour of the marry'd Life,</L>
<L>Our Author Treats you with a Virtuous Wife;</L>
<L>A Lady, who, for Twenty Years, with&s;tood</L>
<L>The pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances of Fle&s;h and Blood;</L>
<L>Her Husband, &s;till a Man of Sen&s;e reputed,</L>

<L>Left her at ripe Eighteen, to &s;eek Renown,</L>
<L>And Battel for a Harlot at <HI>Troy</HI> Town;</L>
<L>To fill his Place, fre&s;h Lovers came in Shoals,</L>
<L>Much &s;uch as now a-days are <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Tools,</L>
<L>Some Men of Wit, but the mo&s;t part were Fools.</L>
<L>They &s;ent her <HI>Billets doux,</HI> and Pre&s;ents many,</L>
<L>Of ancient Tea and <HI>Thericlean</HI> China;</L>
<L>Rail'd at the Gods, toa&s;ted her o'er and o'er,</L>
<L>Dre&s;s'd at Her, danc'd, and fought, and &s;igh'd, and &s;wore;</L>
<L>In &s;hort, did all that Men could do to have her,</L>
<L>And Damn'd them'elves to get into her Favour;</L>
<L>But all in vain, the Virtuous Dame &s;tood Buff,</L>
<L>And let 'em know that &s;he was Coxcomb Proof;</L>
<L><HI>Me&s;&s;ieurs</HI> the <HI>Beaux,</HI> what think you of the Matter?</L>
<L>Don't you believe old <HI>Homer</HI> given to Flatter?</L>

<L>Is it in Woman's Weakne&s;s to with&s;tand?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cea&s;e to be vain, and give the Sex their Due;</L>
<L>Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wives &s;hall prove this Story true:</L>
<L>We have our Cha&s;te <HI>Penelope's,</HI> who mourn</L>
<L>Their Widow'd Beds, and wait their Lords Return;</L>
<L>We have our Heroes too, who bravely bear,</L>
<L>Far from their Home, the Dangers of the War;</L>
<L>Who carele&s;s of the Winter Sea&s;on's Rage,</L>
<L>New Toils explore, and in new Cares engage;</L>
<L><PB REF="8">
From Realm to Realm their Chief unweary'd goes,</L>
<L>And re&s;tle&s;s journies on, to give the World Repo&s;e.</L>
<L>Such are the con&s;tant Labours of the Sun,</L>
<L>Who&s;e active, glorious Cour&s;e is never done;</L>
<L>And tho', when hence he parts, with us 'tis Night,</L>
<L>Still he goes on, and lends to other Worlds his Light.</L>

<L>JUST going to take Water, at the Stairs</L>
<L>I &s;topp'd, and came again to beg your Pray'rs;</L>
<L>You &s;ee how ill my Love has been repaid,</L>
<L>That I am like to live and die a Maid;</L>
<L>Poetick Rules and Ju&s;tice to maintain,</L>
<L>I to the Woods am order'd back again,</L>
<L>To Madam <HI>Cinthia,</HI> and her Virgin Train.</L>
<L>'Tis an uncomfortable Life they lead;</L>
<L>In&s;tead of Quilts and Down, the Silvan Bed</L>
<L>With Skins of Bea&s;ts, with Leaves and Mo&s;s is &s;pread;</L>
<L>No Morning Toilets do their Chambers grace,</L>
<L>Where famous Pearl <HI>Co&s;meticks</HI> find a Place,</L>
<L>With Powder for the Teeth, and Plai&s;ter for the Face.</L>
<L>But in Defiance of Complexion, they,</L>
<L>Like arrant Hu&s;wives, ri&s;e by Break of Day,</L>
<L>Cut a brown Cru&s;t, &s;addle their Nags, and Mounting,</L>
<L>In &s;corn of the Green-Sickne&s;s ride a Hunting:</L>
<L>Your <HI>Sal,</HI> and Harts-horn Drops, they deal not in;</L>
<L>They have no Vapours, nor no witty Spleen.</L>
<L>No Coffee to be had, and I am told,</L>
<L>As to the Tea they drink, 'tis mo&s;tly cold.</L>
<L>For Conver&s;ation, nothing can be wor&s;e,</L>
<L>'Tis all amongst them&s;elves, and that's the Cur&s;e.</L>
<L>One Topick there, as here, does &s;eldom fail,</L>
<L>We Women rarely want a Theme to rail;</L>
<L>But bating that one Plea&s;ure of Backbiting,</L>
<L>There is no Earthly Thing they can delight in.</L>
<L>There are no <HI>Indian</HI> Hou&s;es, to drop in</L>
<L>And fancy Stuffs, and chu&s;e a pretty Screen,</L>
<L>To while away an Hour or &s;o&mdash;<HI>I &s;wear</HI></L>
<L><HI>The&s;e Cups are pretty, but they're deadly dear:</HI></L>
<L>And if &s;ome unexpected Friend appear,</L>
<L><HI>The Dev'l!&mdash;Who cou'd have thought to meet you here?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We &s;hould but very badly entertain</L>
<L>You that delight in Toa&s;ting and Champaign;</L>
<L>But keep your tender Per&s;ons &s;afe at home,</L>
<L>We know you hate hard Riding: But if &s;ome</L>
<L>Tough, hone&s;t, Country Fox-Hunter would come,</L>
<L>Vi&s;it our Godde&s;s, and her Maiden Court,</L>
<L>'Tis Ten to One but we may &s;how him Sport.</L>
