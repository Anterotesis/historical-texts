<P>I DO indeed, my dear Fanny, &s;incerely rejoice at the plea&s;ing pro&s;pects which &s;eem to open to your new friends; I al&s;o congratulate you on being in &s;o high a degree in&s;trumental to their happine&s;s.&mdash;I think I may almo&s;t &s;ay, that Pro|vidence &s;eems to intere&s;t it&s;elf in the future &s;ate of the amiable Laura.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;omething very particular in your becoming accidentally acquainted with Lady So|merville &s;o critically.&mdash;Had your meeting with this charming woman been deferred but a month longer, the connection between ye might, in all probability, have been only productive of una|vailing good wi&s;hes, and mutual e&s;teem;&mdash;but the lucky arrival of &s;ignior Lodovico, has made
<PB N="6" REF="4">
you a principal performer in the great drama of Laura's life.</P>
<P>THOUGH not an ab&s;olute prede&s;tinarian, I am apt to believe that there is a &s;ort of fate in mar|riage; and as one ab&s;urdity creates another, I find I mu&s;t lean a little to the Manichean doc|trine to e&s;tabli&s;h my the&s;is; by &s;uppo&s;ing that there is a good and evil genius, which pre&s;ides occa&s;ionally at that great cri&s;is, on which all the colour of our future lives depend. I &s;incerely hope that Laura's union with the young Mele&s;|pini, will be completed under the happie&s;t au&s;|pices.&mdash;I do not feel one doubt ari&s;e in my mind, with regard to his father's con&s;ent.&mdash;The only cloud which I fore&s;ee to intercept the brighte&s;t &s;un&s;hine, will ari&s;e from the &s;eparation of lady Somerville and Laura&mdash;but that like a cloud al&s;o will pa&s;s away:&mdash;for though the tendere&s;t affec|tion for a hu&s;band does not oppo&s;e the natural claims of parents or relations, on our hearts, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> in &s;ome mea&s;ure le&s;&s;ens their force.&mdash;Our hopes and fears are directed to another object; and &s;elf-love &s;trengthens our attachment to that per&s;on on whom we find our happine&s;s depends.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee I have a pa&s;&s;ion for philo&s;ophizing upon every &s;ubject;&mdash;where incidents do not abound, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to keep up even a monthly corre&s;pondence, without the&s;e little aids; I will not call them arts, for I dete&s;t the mean idea which is conveyed by that expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I SHALL be glad to have my expectations gratified, by hearing of the count's immediate concurrence with his &s;on's inclinations.&mdash;In the mean time, I beg you to pre&s;ent my compliments to lady Somerville, and her fair daughter, and to a&s;&s;ure them, that I regret my not having the plea&s;ure of being known to them.&mdash;Fanny We&s;|ton is quite tran&s;ported at the happy meeting of
<PB N="7" REF="5">
Lodovico and Laura; but &s;ays, &s;he can &s;o &s;carce believe it true, becau&s;e it is likely to &s;end &s;o for|tunately.</P>
<P>I CAN perceive that lady Harriet has doubts, with regard to the event; but as &s;he finds me &s;anguine on the &s;ubject, &s;he &s;uppre&s;&s;es them.&mdash;Sir James Thornton, with a &s;igh exclaimed, what an happy man is Lodovico, to find the ob|ject of his pa&s;&s;ion di&s;engaged! This has left me more in the dark than ever, with regard to his attachment, for I am pretty &s;ure lady Harriet is not his object.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help remarking upon this occa&s;ion, how much the particularities of our own &s;ituati|on, affect our judgments with regard to others; and how much more than we are willing to allow, our opinions are warped and bia&s;&s;ed by it, even in matters that appear indifferent to us.&mdash;Adieu, my Fanny!&mdash;True love from me and mine, to you and yours.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lady</HI> STRAFFON, to <HI>Lady</HI> WOODVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>MY dear Emily &s;hall from henceforth be our augur.&mdash;Be her predictions fortunate, and be they ever verified!</P>
<P>THE wi&s;hed for pacquet is at length arrived;&mdash;it contained a letter for Lodovico, and one for lady Somerville.&mdash;The moment he had read his, which was fraught with congratulations from all his friends, and the mo&s;t plenary indulgence from
<PB N="8" REF="6">
his fond father, to his ardent wi&s;hes, he intreated me to go with him in&s;tantly to the cottage.&mdash;We almo&s;t flew there; and Lodovico in the high|e&s;t rapture, acquainted lady Somerville and his loved Laura with the glad tidings.</P>
<P>LADY Somerville received the news with tears of joy; conflicting pa&s;&s;ions warred in Laura's face; gladne&s;s and grief took turns. The bright &s;uffu&s;ion of her cheeks, the brilliant animation of her eyes, expre&s;&s;ed her heart felt joy; but when &s;he turned tho&s;e eyes upon her mother, their radiance was ob&s;cured by &s;tarting tears; the tran&s;ient ro&s;es fled from her fair cheeks, and left the lily mi&s;tre&s;s of the field.</P>
<P>LADY Somerville was affected by the&s;e &s;udden emotions, and retired to peru&s;e her brother's let|ter.&mdash;She returned &s;oon, and giving it into my hands, &s;aid with a &s;igh, by this you may judge if I flattered my brother by calling him the mo&s;t generous of men. Alas! why mu&s;t I appear unworthy of his kindne&s;s by declining it? but when he knows my rea&s;ons for &s;o doing, I hope he will acquie&s;ce in them and pardon me.</P>
<P>UPON reading the count's letter I found, that after te&s;tifying his joy at his &s;on's attachment to Laura, he added, that it was from the mother's hand he hoped to receive the daughter; and con|jured her, by the friend&s;hip that had ever &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed between them, to return to her native country with her children, to hold the fir&s;t place in his hou&s;e, and to contribute by her pre&s;ence, to re|&s;tore that happine&s;s, which had been deeply wounded by the lo&s;s of an amiable wife.</P>
<P>WHEN I had fini&s;hed the letter, which I read aloud, I feel my&s;elf unhappy, &s;aid lady Somer|ville, in not being able to comply with my kind brother's reque&s;t.&mdash;It is long, much longer than I thought it would be, &s;ince I devoted the rem|ant
<PB N="9" REF="7">
of my wretched days to &s;olitude.&mdash;Here I have lived, and here will pa&s;s that portion of my life which heaven may yet allot me.</P>
<P>AS &s;he &s;poke, I thought I &s;aw her expre&s;&s;ive eyes fixed on her lord's picture, as if addre&s;|&s;ing her vows to him. But &s;he had &s;carcely fini&s;h|ed, when Laura, &s;pringing from her &s;eat, fell at her mother's feet, and catching her hand, cried out, My more than parent! is it po&s;&s;ible your love for me &s;hould have &s;o little power! and could you part &s;o ea&s;ily with her, whom I have often heard you call the living tran&s;cript of your dear dead lord? But Laura mu&s;t not, cannot quit her mo|ther! all plea&s;ing pro&s;pects vani&s;h at that thought; which makes the word appear even more a &s;oli|tude than ever I found this cottage.</P>
<P>THE parent's heart was touched.&mdash;No, my beloved child, &s;aid &s;he, I will not bar your hap|pine&s;s.&mdash;Since you de&s;ire it, I will again behold the fatal place which gave me birth, and even &s;trive to lo&s;e the &s;ad remembrance of my griefs, in your felicity.&mdash;I owe this &s;acrifice to Laura's filial tenderne&s;s.&mdash;What would my child have more?</P>
<P>TEARS and embraces &s;upplied the place of language, or rather &s;uperceded it for &s;ome time; but when their emotions had &s;ub&s;ided, the young pair expre&s;&s;ed their joy and gratitude at lady So|merville's conde&s;cen&s;ion in the mo&s;t proper terms; and the evening was &s;pent in &s;uch a manner as could only be plea&s;ing to tho&s;e who are ble&s;t with feeling hearts.</P>
<P>THE count has accompanied his letter with a very noble pre&s;ent, to enable his &s;i&s;ter and niece to appear as the widow and daughter of lord So|merville.&mdash;There is &s;omething above pride in that thought.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8">AS Lodovico and I returned home, he en+treated me to u&s;e my intere&s;t with lady Somer+ville, to con&s;ent to his being privately married by her lady&s;hip's chaplain, before they &s;et out for Genoa.&mdash;I think &s;he can have no objection to this reque&s;t.</P>
<P>I HOPE I &s;hall be able in a few days to &s;end my Emily an account, that this affair is happily concluded.</P>

<P>WHEN the &s;ubjects are plea&s;ing I find narrative writing not &s;o dull as I once thought&mdash;I begin to fear I &s;hall make but a poor figure in the epi&s;tolary way, when I have con|cluded my little novel; for I hone&s;tly confe&s;s that my dear Emily beats me all to nothing in the moralizing &s;train.&mdash;Sorry am I, on this account only, that I mu&s;t now proceed to the deno&uuml;ement of my &s;imple yet intere&s;ting &s;tory.</P>
<P>LADY Somerville de&s;ired two days to con&s;ider of Lodovico's propo&s;al; at the end of that time &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her con&s;ent in a mo&s;t elegant letter to me.&mdash;She &s;aid, that as &s;he had on every oc|ca&s;ion concurred with my reque&s;ts, &s;he hoped I would not think her too pre&s;uming to make one to me; which was, that I would accept of her cottage with every thing which it contained, except her lord's picture, and that with my per|mi&s;&s;ion &s;he would fill its vacant place with Lau|ra's portrait.</P>
<P>I WAS both plea&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at her po|litene&s;s and genero&s;ity.&mdash;I accepted her pre&s;ent.
<PB N="11" REF="9">
&mdash;In that charming &s;ejour, I &s;hall &s;pend many hours in thinking of its amiable owner, and in reflecting on the in&s;crutable ways of Providence, who after &s;o many trials has been plea&s;ed to re&s;|tore this valuable woman to her country and friends.</P>
<P>SUCH characters as hers, were never meant to droop in ob&s;curity; &s;he owes her&s;elf to &s;oci|ety, and will I hope recover &s;ome degree of that happine&s;s &s;he thinks totally lo&s;t, in the ex|erci&s;e of tho&s;e virtues which in her retired &s;tate &s;he could never be called on to exert.</P>
<P>SLIGHT as the preparations were for a wed|ding, which it was determined &s;hould be pri|vate, they took up every moment of our time till ye&s;terday morning; when Lodovico, Lucy, Sir John, my little Emily and I &s;et out together for the cottage before breakfa&s;t&mdash;We were re|ceived by lady Somerville and the charming bride, with that graceful ea&s;e and politene&s;s which is the re&s;ult of good &s;en&s;e, and operates equally upon all occa&s;ions. After breakfa&s;t Sir John led Leura into the chapel. Lady Somerville pre&s;ented her hand to Lodovico; the prie&s;t and alter were prepared; Sir John had the honour of per&s;onating Laura's father, and had the plea|&s;ure of compleating Lodovico's wi&s;hes, by be&s;|towing her hand where &s;he had already given her heart. The &s;ervour of lady Somerville's devotion was truly edifying; when the ceremony was over, &s;he endeavoured in vain to &s;uppre&s;s her tears; but they were tears of joy.</P>
<P>SIR John pre&s;ented the bride with a pair of ear-rings, and a cro&s;s of diamonds, and I had the plea&s;ure of placing my picture in a bracelet upon lady Somerville's arm. From the elegence of our dinner and &s;upper at the cottage, I appre|hend that lady Somerville is one of tho&s;e extra|ordinary
<PB N="12" REF="10">
characters who do not think that the mo&s;t refined under&s;tanding or the mo&s;t exalted &s;entiments, place a woman above the little duties of life.</P>
<P>THE new married couple are to dine with me this day. Sir John is gone to try if he can pre|vail upon lady Somerville to accompany them. Next week they &s;et out for Genoa; they are to occupy our hou&s;e in town, while they &s;tay in London.

<P>I SINCERELY congratulate my dear Fanny on the fortunate deno&uuml;ement of her plea&s;ing and intere&s;ting narrative, and join in her good wi&s;hes for the happine&s;s of lady Somerville and the new married pair.&mdash;As you &s;eem inclined to rally me on my turn for moralizing I &s;hall not exert it at pre&s;ent, though I think lady Somerville's &s;tory a very proper &s;ubject for it.</P>
<P>BUT to deal inge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ou&s;ly, I have a &s;tronger rea&s;on for declining to expatiate on it than what I have mentioned, which is my being &s;tinted in time, as I am going to dine at lord Withers's, where we &s;hall &s;tay this night.

<P>IN ju&s;tice to tho&s;e friendly apprehen&s;ions which you &s;eem to &s;uffer on my account, I think I ought to inform you, that the &s;o-much dreaded event of an interview with the mar|chione&s;s, is over without my being &s;en&s;ible of the lea&s;t ill con&s;equence from it. All lovely! all engaging, as &s;he is! I had armed my <HI>heart</HI> with the remembrance of her former treatment; and though <HI>the little rebel</HI> did flutter at her &s;ight, I think its emotions were rather the effect of re|&s;entment than a &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE wor&s;t &s;ymptom I di&s;covered in my&s;elf (I will be perfectly &s;incere) was my being piqued, at the compo&s;ure of her air and deportment, when &s;he fir&s;t &s;aluted me. Is it po&s;&s;ible, Sey|mour, &s;he can be really indifferent? or is it only the artifice of her &s;ex, that makes her appear &s;o?</P>
<P>AS the room was very full, and &s;he &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance from me, before I could approach her, &s;he was taken out to dance by lord Belling|ham.&mdash;When her fir&s;t minuet was over, &s;he de|&s;ired
<PB N="14" REF="12">
I &s;hould be called out; and though I felt the utmo&s;t reluctance to accept the compliment, it was impo&s;&s;ible to refu&s;e. I am certain I never acquited my&s;elf &s;o ill in my life. You have &s;een her dance, and therefore know that the eyes of the whole company, were engaged by her, and my confu&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed.</P>
<P>AS I led her to her &s;eat, &s;he wi&s;hed me <HI>joy,</HI> and a&s;ked if the fair cau&s;e of <HI>it</HI> was in the room? I an&s;wered yes.&mdash;She then intreated I would pre|&s;ent her to lady Woodville, whom &s;he longed to &s;ee more than any per&s;on in England; as lord Seymour had told her that &s;he was a perfect beauty.</P>
<P>I MADE no reply, hut led her to the place where lady Woodville &s;at, who received her with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e and politene&s;s. I &s;wear to you my dear Seymour, that Emily never appeared half &s;o lovely in my eyes, as at that moment. The innocence and gaiety of her heart, lighted up her charms; and I flattered my&s;elf that the mar|chione&s;s's brow &s;eemed overca&s;t with the pale hue of envy.</P>
<P>LADY Harriet and &s;he renewed their acquain|tance; they all, &s;oon after, joined your &s;i&s;ter Sandford, and continued in the &s;ame party, for the remainder of the evening.

<SALUTE>Dear WOODVILLE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thank you for the attention you have &s;hewn to tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions, which you &s;eem to think groundle&s;s. I did not expect to hear from you, during your &s;tay at York. The con&s;tant hurry and di&s;&s;ipation of the &s;cene, would have been a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for your &s;ilence, both to me and your&s;elf, if you had not fancied you had not good news to communicate.</P>
<P>I KNOW you incapable of the &s;malle&s;t deceit, and am certain that you think your la&s;t a faithful tran&s;cript of your heart. But alas, my friend! you impo&s;e upon your&s;elf, if you imagine your pa&s;&s;ion for the marchione&s;s extinct; or that it is po&s;&s;ible for you to give a preference, however ju&s;tly de&s;erved, to any other woman breathing. Therefore, for the truly amiable lady Woodville's &s;ake I conjure you to avoid all future compari|&s;ons, as I think it will be highly injurious to her merits, to put her on a level with that object, which your partiality has made you look upon as the &s;tandard of perfection.</P>
<P>AFTER the confe&s;&s;ion of my own weakne&s;s, I condemn my&s;elf, for rea&s;oning with you, upon this &s;ubject.&mdash;I know it is preaching to the winds.&mdash;Our pa&s;&s;ions make our fate; and we ought to &s;uffer, without repining, tho&s;e calamities we bring upon our&s;elves: but what philo&s;ophy &s;hould enable us to bear the heart-rending agonies, of having involved the innocent in our puni&s;hment,

and rendered the amiable, and de&s;erving unhap|py! Who can &s;peak peace to my &s;ad heart, when I reflect upon the mi&s;eries, in which I have plunged the ever-dear Charlotte Beaumont.</P>
<P>I KNOW this horrid image will &s;hock your nature, and, for a time, you will &s;hudder at your&s;elf. But quickly &s;ay, the&s;e are the gloomy vi&s;ions of Seymours di&s;turbed brain. I would not make my Emily unhappy for the world&mdash;then fly directly to the marchione&s;s to bani&s;h the &s;ad thought.&mdash;But I have done, for ever, on the theme; for if this picture does not &s;peak to your heart, I cannot paint more &s;trongly.</P>
<P>MY wi&s;hes for your happine&s;s but without hope, except in flight, &s;hall &s;till attend upon you; and my highe&s;t e&s;teem &s;hall ever wait upon the lovely lady Woodville.</P>

I am truly grieved to find your mind &s;o overclouded, or ingrained, with the dark tints of melancholy, as not to allow your rea&s;on fair play.

Have I not been married above eight months, and am I not, now, ju&s;t as tender, and obliging, as the fir&s;t day we were united?</P>
<P>HADST thou real pity, or compa&s;&s;ion, thou would&s;t advi&s;e me to de&s;i&s;t from my pur&s;uit of the marchione&s;s, on her account, rather than lady Woodville's.

<P>AH, Seymour! what a tale have I to unfold to you! I am undone, for ever lo&s;t to vir|tue, relap&s;ed again, to all my former follies&mdash;I doat, I die for love! Do not de&s;pi&s;e me, Sey|mour, but once again &s;tretch forth thy friendly hand, and &s;trive to &s;ave a &s;inking wretch. Alas,
<PB N="19" REF="17">
it is in vain! fate overwhelms me, and I mu&s;t yield to the impetuous torrent. But hear my &s;tory, fir&s;t, before you pronounce &s;tern &s;entence on me, and guilty as I am, perhaps you will pity me.</P>
<P>FOR &s;ome days pa&s;t, the marchione&s;s con|trived to throw her&s;elf perpetually in my way, and &s;trove to engage me in the mo&s;t intere&s;ting conver&s;ations, by hinting at particular &s;cenes, in which we had formerly been actors. Fool that I was, the recollection charmed me, and my weak heart expended with delight, at the repeti|tion of its former follies.</P>
<P>LAST night your &s;i&s;ter, lady Sandford not be|ing well, declined going to the ball. The mar|chione&s;s &s;ent to lady Woodville, to de&s;ire &s;he might attend her to the rooms. Emily politely a&s;&s;ented, and they went together&mdash;&s;he returned and &s;upped with us.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;upper, &s;he &s;aid &s;he hated being coop|ed up in a carriage, at the cour&s;e, and a&s;ked if I could lend her a hor&s;e, for the next day. The ladies informed her that no woman of fa&s;hion, ever appeared on hor&s;eback, at a race. She re|plied, &s;he had no idea of a <HI>&s;alique</HI> law, impo&s;ed by jockies; that &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed all vulgar prejudices, and would be the fir&s;t to break through this arbi|trary rule, if &s;he could engage any lady to ac|company her.</P>
<P>SHE &s;oon prevailed on mi&s;s We&s;ton, who rides remarkably well to be of her party, and again applied to me for a hor&s;e. I told her I had not one, that had been u&s;ed to carry a lady, but if &s;he would venture on that which I u&s;ually rode, it &s;hould be at her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>SHE accepted my offer, and after dinner the next day, Fanny We&s;ton, Ransford, and I, at|tended her at lady Sandford's; and &s;ure there ne|ver
<PB N="20" REF="18">

<L>" <HI>The charming I&s;abel, &s;peaks, looks, and moves.</HI>"</L></Q>
<P>WHEN we came to the race-ground, all the company thronged round her, and though the hor&s;es were then running, &s;he &s;eemed to be the &s;ole object of every one's attention. She affec|ted to be di&s;plea&s;ed at the general gaze, and &s;aid if there was room in lady Woodville's carriage, &s;he would get into it. We rode up immediately to it, but on perceiving that Emily was in the chariot, and lady Harriet with her, &s;he would not &s;uffer me to mention her de&s;ign, le&s;t it might be inconvenient to my wife, who&s;e pre&s;ent con|dition is now very apparent.</P>
<P>THORNTON was by the &s;ide of the chariot, talking to the ladies who were in it. He imme|diately retired to make way for us to come clo&s;e. A croud had followed us, and &s;ome one of their hor&s;es &s;truck that on which the marchione&s;s rode;&mdash;it immediately made an effort to di&s;engage it|&s;elf from the throng, and in &s;pite of all &s;he could do, ran away with her, with &s;uch ama|zing &s;wiftne&s;s, that it &s;eemed to outgo all the racers.</P>
<P>I FOLLOWED in&s;tantly&mdash;O Seymour judge of my emotions, when I &s;aw her fall to the groud! when I came up to her, &s;he was &s;en&s;ele&s;s, her eyes clo&s;ed, and her face covered with blood and du&s;t. I rai&s;ed her in my arms, and held her to my brea&s;t; but unable long to &s;u&s;tain her weight in that po&s;ture, I &s;unk down gently, held her on my knees, and gazed in &s;tupid &s;i|lence.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="19">AT that in&s;tant, numbers came up to us; a|mong the re&s;t, Thornton and lady Woodville, who on perceiving blood upon my cheek, fainted&mdash;She might have fallen to the earth, for me. I was in&s;en&s;ible to all the world! Thornton luck|ily caught her in his arms, and conveyed her to her chariot.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the applications that were u&s;ed, the marchione&s;s &s;eemed irrecove|rable, and my de&s;pair is not to be expre&s;&s;ed. A gentleman that was pre&s;ent, opened a vein in her arm. She then lifted up her languid eyes, and looking round her, clo&s;ed them quick again, and whi&s;pered, as &s;he lay upon my bo&s;om,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I die my lord; but ought not to repine, &s;ince I ex|pire within your arms."</Q></P>
<P>A CRIMSON blu&s;h &s;ucceeded to her palene&s;e, and a va&s;t &s;hower of tears &s;oon followed. I know not what reply I made, but I have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e it mu&s;t have been expre&s;&s;ive of the com|plicated pa&s;&s;ions which affected me. I carried her in my arms, to lady Winterton's coach, and conveyed her in that manner to your &s;i&s;ter's.</P>
<P>We had all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance this place could afford. My &s;pirits are &s;o extremely harra&s;&s;ed, that I can|not write more, than ju&s;t to give you the &s;atis|faction to know that &s;he is not in danger&mdash;would I could &s;ay as much.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as the fair invalid was laid on the bed, and the medical tribe who were &s;um|moned from all quarters had performed their u&s;ual evolutions, of pul&s;e-feeling, profound looks, and long pre&s;criptions, I knelt by her bed-&s;ide, and tenderly inquired her health? She told me, that though much hurt, &s;he did believe, the only incurable wound &s;he had received, was given by her&s;elf, in the weak confe&s;&s;ion &s;he had made, when &s;he thought her &s;ituation had placed her beyond the nece&s;&s;ity of longer di&s;gui&s;ing the tender &s;entiments, &s;he felt for me. She would give worlds, to recal what &s;he had &s;aid; but, as &s;he knew that was impo&s;&s;ible, begged I would not de&s;|pi&s;e her, or meanly think her capable of a de&s;ign, to rival lady Woodville; and that the moment &s;he was &s;ufficiently recovered, &s;he &s;hould fly me, and England for ever,</P>
<P>THINK of my &s;ituation, Seymour! and for|give my weakne&s;s, while I tell you I poured forth all the fondne&s;s long concealed, even from my|&s;elf, within my labouring bo&s;om, and &s;wore, with too much truth, I never had, one moment cea&s;ed to love her. She &s;ighed and wept; I ki&s;&s;ed her lilly hand, and bathed it with her tears.</P>
<P>HOW much longer we &s;hould have continued in this &s;ituation, I know not, had I not been rou&s;ed by a me&s;&s;age from lady Woodville, to in|quire the marchione&s;s's health, and an excu&s;e for not making the inquiry in per&s;on, on account of
<PB N="23" REF="21">
her own indi&s;po&s;ition. I &s;tarted, Seymour&mdash;and recollected that I had a wife.</P>
<P>I FLEW home in&s;tantly; found Emily had been blooded, and put to bed.&mdash;I rejoiced at be|ing able to avoid the &s;ight of that amiable wo|man; &s;aid I would not di&s;turb her, by going into her chamber, and ordered another bed to be got ready for me, again&s;t night.</P>
<P>CONSCIOUS guilt will make a coward of the brave&s;t man. I could not bear my own thoughts.&mdash;I dreaded being alone. I went to the coffee-hou&s;e, to drown reflection in noi&s;e and non&s;en&s;e. The conver&s;ation turned intirely on the accident that had befallen the marchione&s;s, and I replied with the utmo&s;t complacency, to every trifling que&s;tion that was a&s;ked, becau&s;e it related to her.</P>
<P>I SOON grew weary of this &s;cene. I walked out, and found my &s;teps in&s;en&s;ibly &s;traying to|wards the marchione&s;s.&mdash;By chance I met Thorn|ton, who with more liveline&s;s in his looks than I have &s;een for a long time, told me lady Wood|ville was much better, and would be glad to &s;ee me; that &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, at their not &s;uffering me to go into her chamber, when I called at home, though &s;he was then a&s;leep.</P>
<P>I WENT directly back with him, and &s;aw my Emily; &s;he looked pale, and di&s;pirited, que&s;ti|oned me with great tenderne&s;s about the marchi|one&s;s, and &s;aid the fright &s;he had &s;uffered, on her account, joined to her apprehen&s;ion of my hav|ing received &s;ome hurt, had quite overpowered her; but &s;he would endeavour to become a &s;touter &s;oldier. Sweet gentlene&s;s! how thy &s;oft looks upbraid me!</P>
<P>I DETERMINED not to go to the marchione&s;s, that night, but &s;ent to know how &s;he did, and &s;at

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lord</HI> WOODVILLE, to <HI>Lord</HI> SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>TOO cruel Seymour! how am I to interpret &s;uch an ob&s;tinate &s;ilence? am I &s;o far &s;unk in your e&s;teem, that you di&s;dain even to hold conver&s;e, or corre&s;pondence with me? Now was the time, to have exerted all your friend&s;hip, and &s;topped me on the very verge of ruin.&mdash;But you di&s;claim the painful office of coun&s;elling an incorrigible, &s;elf-willed man; and I now triumph in your cold neglect. Le&s;t to my&s;elf in &s;uch a critical juncture, I have a higher pride, in being able, from my own conduct, to claim your fried|&s;hip and e&s;teem, than I could have felt, had I acted conformably to your prudent advice, and declined the meeting of my mo&s;t dangerous foe.</P>
<P>THE morning after the date of my la&s;t, I was &s;urprized to find lady Woodville in the dining-room, dre&s;&s;ed, and waiting breakfa&s;t for me, when I came down &s;tairs, between &s;even and eight o'clock.&mdash;I thought &s;he looked paler, and more delicate, than I had ever &s;een her, with an air of re&s;ignation impre&s;&s;ed upon her countenance, which, added to its natural, &s;weet|ne&s;s, had rendered her one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting objects, I had ever beheld, The tenderne&s;s with
<PB N="25" REF="23">
which I enquired her health, &s;eemed to animate her languid frame, and her eyes quickly reco|vered their native lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>AFTER breakfa&s;t, &s;he propo&s;ed accompanying me to &s;ee the marchione&s;s, I was embarra&s;&s;ed be|yond mea&s;ure; but knew not how to prevent her doing, what appeared to be &s;o proper. Ju&s;t then, Thornton luckily came into the room, which afforded me a moment to recollect my&s;elf. I told her I thought it would be better to &s;end fir&s;t, to inquire how the marchione&s;s had re&s;ted, and whether &s;he was yet able to receive our vi&s;its? Emily &s;eemed to blu&s;h at her want of con&s;ide|ration, and readily a&s;&s;ented to my propo&s;al.</P>
<P>WILLIAMS was di&s;patched with a card, and &s;oon returned with a verbal an&s;wer, that the marchione&s;s was much better, and would be glad to &s;ee us. I hoped &s;he would have had addre&s;s enough, to have &s;aved me from the embarra&s;&s;|ment, which &s;uch an interview mu&s;t give me. But there was now no retreating; and Emily and I got into the chariot together.</P>
<P>WHEN we were &s;hewn into the marchione&s;s's apartment, &s;he was lying on a couch, in the mo&s;t elegant di&s;habille.&mdash;What a &s;ubject for an Apel|les, Seymour! It was with difficulty I could re|&s;train my&s;elf from expre&s;&s;ing the tran&s;ports that I felt. She ro&s;e to receive lady Woodville, with &s;uch an air of graceful dignity, as queens might gladly learn. I &s;aw that Emily blu&s;hed, and looked confu&s;ed, at her amazing &s;uperiority, but was relieved by the entrance of your &s;i&s;ter, lady Sandford.</P>
<P>THE marchione&s;s's behaviour towards me, was remarkably cold, and di&s;tant; and I thought &s;he overacted her part &s;o much, that any other woman in the world, but Emily mu&s;t have per|ceived &s;omething extraordinary, in the change
<PB N="26" REF="24">
of her manner; but happily lady Woodville is a &s;tranger to &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>YOU may &s;uppo&s;e our vi&s;it was not a very long one, yet it appeared to me in&s;ufferably te|dious; and I thought my&s;elf more obliged to Emily, when &s;he ro&s;e to go away, than ever I had been to any one in my life. I had the happine&s;s to hear that the marchione&s;s had recei|ved no hurt from her fall, that could be of any ill con&s;equence; the blood that appeared, was from a &s;light contu&s;ion in her no&s;e.</P>
<P>RANSFORD came to wait on her, while we were there; and as he handed my wife to her carriage, and I was quitting the room, the mar|chione&s;s, with the utmo&s;t <HI>fiert&eacute;,</HI> though in a low voice, &s;aid, lord Woodville, return in&s;tantly, or never!</P>
<P>THE manner with which &s;he pronounced the&s;e words, a&s;toni&s;hed and confounded me. I then &s;aw that her behaviour towards me was the effect of re&s;entment, not art;&mdash;yet how had I offended, how forfeited that tenderne&s;s which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed for me the day before? Inexplicable creature! my&s;terious woman! of all riddles, the harde&s;t to be expounded by the boa&s;ted wi&s;|dom of thy va&s;&s;al man!</P>
<P>I BOWED, and withdrew in the utmo&s;t a|mazement at her conduct; and by vainly en|deavouring to account for it, I fell into &s;uch a profound reverie, that I did not even perceive the motion of the carriage till it &s;topped at our lodgings.</P>
<P>I RHEN felt my&s;elf a&s;hamed at not having ta|ken the lea&s;t notice of Emily during our little journey; and by way of &s;aying &s;omething, told her I had heen con&s;idering whether we might not &s;et out for London the next day, if it was agree|able to her. She, &s;miling, &s;aid my will was
<PB N="27" REF="25">
hers; and though quite unprepared for &s;uch an expedition, as &s;he did not know I purpo&s;ed going &s;o &s;oon, &s;he would be ready at what hour I plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>I KNEW not what I &s;aid, when I talked of London, and had not the lea&s;t intention of car|rying her there; but my blunder was lucky, as it gave me an opportunity of paying a well de|&s;erved compliment to her complacency, and con|de&s;cen&s;ion, and al&s;o of paying the way to my going without her, if the &s;overeign arbitre&s;s of my fate, &s;hould command me to attend her. I likewi&s;e appeared to have the merit of &s;acri|ficing my own inclination to hers, by readily con&s;enting to her returning to Woodfort.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e terms we parted, and I &s;et out, with a &s;low pace, and a di&s;turbed mind, to mea|&s;ure back the ground I had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed. During my walk, I reflected upon the di&s;agreeable nece&s;|&s;ity I had laid my&s;elf under, of acting the hypo|crite, with a woman who&s;e amiable qualities compelled me to e&s;teem her, and who&s;e per&s;onal charms fully intitled her to the fonde&s;t affection of an unengaged heart. Deceit cannot dwell long with honour; and I determined either to &s;acrifice my pa&s;&s;ion to my virtue, or at once to triumph over character, honour, and every other con&s;ideration in life, and act the villain boldly.</P>
<P>ALMOST di&s;tracted with the &s;truggles of my mind, I entered the marchione&s;s's apartment, I found her lying on a couch, with a handkerchief clo&s;e to her eyes, which &s;he removed, upon my entrance, and &s;howed her lovely face, all bathed in tears. I advanced with precipitation, and would have ki&s;&s;ed her hand, but &s;he withdrew it from me, with &s;uch an air of coldne&s;s and di&s;dain, as almo&s;t petrified me: then ri&s;ing bri&s;kly, &s;aid is your wife with you?</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="26">I GRAVELY an&s;werd, no. She then bur&s;t into a violent pa&s;&s;ion of tears, and exclaimed, Ah, Woodville! after what had pa&s;&s;ed between us, but a few &s;hort hours ago, how could you u&s;e me thus! How did you dare to in&s;ult me with the pre&s;ence of that object, who&s;e <HI>legal</HI> claim to your affection, renders mine criminal?</P>
<P>I WAS &s;o much alarmed and confounded, at the vehemence of her voice, and manner, that I knew not what an&s;wer to make, but told her it was lady Woodville who had propo&s;ed our com|ing together, and that I knew not how to avoid attending her, without running the hazard of giving her offence.</P>
<P>WHAT, then you fear as well as love her, and you avow it to my face!&mdash;I would not willing|ly, madam, inflict unnece&s;&s;ary wounds, upon the victim I have &s;acrificed to you, nor add brutality to perfidy.&mdash;Her colour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e to crim&s;on.</P>
<P>SO then, my lord, you vainly hope to keep a flame alive in two &s;uch hearts as mine and lady Woodville's! to love <HI>en Turk,</HI> and play our pa&s;|&s;ions off, again&s;t each other, for your &s;port!&mdash;Amazing vanity! But know it will not do, my lord; her &s;oft, in&s;ipid nature might perhaps &s;ub|mit to be the loved &s;ultana of the day, then yield her place to me, or any other, and meanly take it back again, from your caprice; but I will reign alone, or el&s;e de&s;pi&s;e that tran&s;itory toy, the empire of your heart.</P>
<P>YOU may remember, madam, there was a time, when more than you now a&s;k, or I can give, my hand and heart were offered at your feet; you then di&s;dained to accept them; they are no longer free. For doating on you, as I do, with all the fervor of di&s;tracted pa&s;&s;ion, I can|not be in&s;en&s;ible to the merits of unoffending
<PB N="29" REF="27">
innocence, and love; nor cea&s;e one hour, to feel the angui&s;h of remor&s;e, for having injured lady Woodville.</P>
<P>IF the frankne&s;s of this confe&s;&s;ion, madam, &s;hould exclude me for ever from your love, I have the con&s;olation to know that it mu&s;t in&s;ure me your e&s;teem.&mdash;Without &s;ome claim to the latter, I &s;hould be unworthy of the former. But if under the&s;e unhappy circum&s;tances, you &s;till can conde&s;cend to feel that pa&s;&s;ion, which you have profe&s;t, let me upon my knees, conjure you to tell me how I may pre&s;erve my honour, without forfeiting what is as dear to me, your love.</P>
<P>I HAD knelt at her feet, during the latter part of this di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;Her eyes had &s;treamed.&mdash;I do not blu&s;h to own that mine were not quite dry. She remained &s;ilent for &s;ome minutes, and when I pre&s;&s;ed her to &s;peak, &s;he replied with a determined voice and manner: There is no al|ternative, my lord; you mu&s;t fly with me, or never &s;ee me more.</P>
<P>I HAD dreaded &s;uch a propo&s;al, yet could &s;carce believe &s;he would make it, and with the utmo&s;t agitation cried out, Impo&s;&s;ible! But be|fore I could utter another &s;yllable &s;he laid her hand upon my lips, and &s;aid, I command you &s;ilence.&mdash;You mu&s;t not, &s;hall not an&s;wer me. I know you are to quit this place immediately: would I had never &s;een it. But as you are now to determine the fate of one who&s;e love for you has made her leap the bounds pre&s;cribed to her weak &s;ex, O do not reply ra&s;hly! but take the la&s;t moment that can be allowed, before you pronounce the doom of a fond wretch, who has placed more than her l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">fe&mdash;her happine&s;s or mi|&s;ery&mdash;in your power.</P>
<P>I ROSE and bowed, totally unable to &s;peak
<PB N="30" REF="28">
or even to think, from the confu&s;ion of my ideas. She took advantage of my &s;ilence to tell me &s;he would not receive any letter upon this &s;ubject, from me, but that &s;he expected to &s;ee me at twelve o'clock next day; and &s;miling added, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t you &s;hould f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rget, I will pre&s;ent you with a little monitor, which will remind you of your ab&s;ent friend.</P>
<P>SHE then gave me her picture, which I had a thou&s;and times in our fir&s;t acquaintance &s;olicited in vain. I ki&s;&s;ed it with tran&s;port. See here, &s;aid &s;he, and drew a miniature of me, which I had formerly given her, out of her pocket; and now take care that you pre&s;erve my image, as carefully as I have done yours.</P>
<P>THEN looking at her watch, you mu&s;t leave me; it is near lady Sandford's dining hour, and I mu&s;t dre&s;s. How &s;lowly will the mi&s;erable moments creep, till we two meet again! But I &s;hall defy time, after that, as it can neither add to, or dimini&s;h from the felicity or angui&s;h, which mu&s;t then irrevocably be my portion.</P>
<P>I INTREATED her to &s;pare me on that &s;ub|ject, as &s;he would not permit me to reply. You mu&s;t withdraw, then, immediately, my lord, for I can neither think, or &s;peak, on any other theme. She permitted me to ki&s;s her hand be|fore I left her; and &s;eemed to have conquered all tho&s;e violent pa&s;&s;ions, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her at my approach. I confe&s;s I quitted her, with in|finite reluctance, and &s;o I now mu&s;t you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lord</HI> WOODVILLE, to <HI>Lord</HI> SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>I PARTED from the marchione&s;s in a more irre&s;olute and confu&s;ed &s;tate of mind, than I had ever before experienced. I well knew that all the colour of my future fate, depended on the re&s;olution I was compelled to make within a few &s;hort hours. I found it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to determine on any thing, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the importance of my final determination.</P>
<P>NEVER, &s;ure, had rea&s;on and pa&s;&s;ion a &s;everer &s;trife. One moment, I re&s;olved to &s;acrifice eve|ry thing to love; to fly with my adored I&s;abella, into &s;ome di&s;tant country,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and live in &s;hades with her, and love alone."</Q>
The next in|&s;tant, the image of the gentle Emily obtruded it&s;elf upon my imagination, in her pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation; pale, and dying. Methought I heard her la&s;t &s;oft &s;igh expre&s;s my name; I felt my&s;elf a murderer, and &s;tarted at my &s;hadow.</P>
<P>IN this di&s;tracted &s;tate, I had wandered a con&s;iderable way in the field, and &s;aw night coming on apace, without power or inclination to think of returning to York, when I heard the &s;ound of a hor&s;e galloping towards me.&mdash;The man who rode him called to me, to direct him the neare&s;t way to the town, and al&s;o if I could inform him where lord Woodville lived.</P>
<P>THE &s;ound of my own name &s;urprized me, and I inquired his bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;The fellow quickly knew me; he in&s;tantly alighted, and told me he was a &s;ervant of Sir Harry Ransford's, and had been &s;ent expre&s;s, to let his young ma&s;ter know that lady Ransford had eloped, two days before, with captain Barnard; and that it was
<PB N="32" REF="30">
&s;uppo&s;ed they were gone either to France or Ireland. He added that the poor old knight was almo&s;t di&s;tracted for the lo&s;s of his lady, and wanted his &s;on to pur&s;ue the ravi&s;her.</P>
<P>THE &s;ervant pre&s;&s;ed me to mount his hor&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;imple a&s;toni&s;hment at my being by my&s;elf in &s;uch a lone&s;ome place at that hour. I refu&s;ed his offer, and we walked on together. It was near eight o'clock when I got home; and as it was the la&s;t night of the races, I did, &s;uppo&s;e Emily was gone to the ball&mdash;but I found her alone.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT &s;he looked as if &s;he had been in tears, though her eyes &s;parkled when &s;he &s;aw me. This little circum&s;tance had its full weight; and the unaffected joy &s;he &s;hewed at my return, without &s;eeming to be alarmed at my ab&s;ence, when contra&s;ted with the violence of temper, which the marchione&s;s had di&s;covered in the morning, &s;o far turned the &s;cale, as to determine me to remain a &s;lave to the obligations I owe to my wife, and the world: and though I am per|&s;uaded that I &s;hall never be able to extract the arrow from my wounded heart, I will &s;uffer it to rankle there in &s;ilence, and endeavour to de|rive fortitude &s;ufficient to bear the angui&s;h, from the noble con&s;ideration of having &s;acrificed my plea&s;ure&mdash;I mu&s;t, not &s;tile it happine&s;s&mdash;to my duty&mdash;What would my friend have more?</P>
<P>MY mind grew much calmer, after the&s;e re|flections.&mdash;In order to prevent my relap&s;ing, I locked up the marchione&s;s's picture in my writ|ing box, and threw the key into the fire, that it might not be in my power to gaze away my rea&s;on, for that night at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>EMILY was much &s;urprized, at the account of lady Ransford, and captain Barnard&mdash;her own innocence keeps her a child.&mdash;She begged
<PB N="33" REF="31">
I would not mention the &s;tory before lady Har|riet.&mdash;I knew there had been an attachment between the captain and her, but thought it long &s;ince over&mdash;yet why &s;hould I imagine that time could conquer love? O! never, never, Seymour!</P>
<P>LADY Woodville and I &s;upped, t&ecirc;te &aacute; t&ecirc;te; the young folks, as &s;he calls them, though they are all older than her&s;elf, &s;taid late at the ball.&mdash;I was impatient for Ransford's return, and had &s;ent to the a&s;&s;embly room, to look for him, but he was not there.&mdash;I ordered every thing to be in readine&s;s for his &s;etting out immediately on his filial errand.</P>
<P>WHEN the ladies and Thornton came in, I retired to my chamber to wait for Ransford. By frequently revolving my unhappy &s;ituation in my mind, I began to con&s;ider it in a new light; which at once encrea&s;ed my mi&s;ery, and confirmed me in the ju&s;tne&s;s of the re&s;olution, I had before taken, of bearing it in &s;ilence. Upon &s;trict examination, I found I was the only culpable per&s;on of the three; and therefore ought to be the only &s;ufferer&mdash;</P>
<P>WRETCH that I was, I had deceived my&s;elf; and in con&s;equence of that error, I had impo&s;ed upon another! How vain to imagine that the marchione&s;s's cruel treatment of my love, her preferring age, and infirmity to me, on account of &s;uperior rank and riches, had &s;upplied me with arms &s;ufficient to vindicate my freedom, and break her tyrannic chains. O Seymour! they are twined about my heart, and nought, I fear, but death can loo&s;e them!</P>
<P>IT was near three o'clock, when Ransford came in; he &s;eemed in very high &s;pirits&mdash;when I told him of lady Ransford's ill conduct, he &s;aid he was not in the lea&s;t &s;urprized; he had
<PB N="34" REF="32">
long known that his &s;tepdame only waited for a gallant, who had &s;pirit enough to engage in &s;uch a frolic with her; and he thought his father had a fair riddance.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;urprized to hear him treat the affair &s;o lightly, as I know him to be a man of nice honour. I then a&s;ked him, whether he intended going immediately to his father? he an&s;wered no; &s;aid he was engaged in a pur&s;uit of the ut|mo&s;t con&s;equence, which he could not quit, and that he did not believe he &s;hould &s;ee Ransford-Hall for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>I TOLD him I thought his father would have rea&s;on to re&s;ent his neglect, and pre&s;&s;ed him to wait upon him, though but for one day. He per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution, and we parted. I think it odd, that Ransford did not communicate his motives for acting in this manner, to me;&mdash;but what have I to do with other people's affairs? my poor tortured mind is &s;ufficiently incumber|ed with its own.</P>
<P>I THINK I need not tell you that I pa&s;&s;ed a &s;leeple&s;s night.&mdash;At breakfa&s;t, I told Emily that I &s;hould be ready to &s;et out with her for Wood|fort, after dinner if &s;he plea&s;ed. She &s;eemed de|lighted, and the carriage was ordered, at half an hour after four.&mdash;I intreated Sir James Thorn|ton to return with us, for a few days; he made a thou&s;and excu&s;es; but at length complied, at lady Woodville's reque&s;t.</P>
<P>I WAS now to enter upon the mo&s;t arduous ta&s;k of my whole life; that of taking an ever|la&s;ting leave of the woman whome I doated on&mdash;and in this highe&s;t act of &s;elf-denial, I mu&s;t appear to her, a volunteer! I am grieved that Brutus &s;hould have &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"virtue was but a name,"</Q> O let me bend before her awful &s;hrine,
<PB N="35" REF="33">
and pay my grateful vows, for the kind aid &s;he lent me, in that hour of trial!</P>
<P>I ENDEAVOURED to a&s;&s;ume an air of calm|ne&s;s on my entering the marchione&s;s's apart|ment. She fixed her eyes, her piercing eyes, in &s;teadfa&s;t gaze upon me, as if to read my &s;oul. A minute pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence. I found &s;he would not &s;peak, and hardly &s;eemed to breathe. You &s;ee before you madam, an unhappy man, who dares not purcha&s;e tran&s;port with remor&s;e; and there|fore, turns &s;elf-bani&s;hed from her &s;ight, whom mo&s;t his &s;oul adores!</P>
<P>SHE quick exclaimed, is it po&s;&s;ible! and am I then di&s;pi&s;ed, neglected&mdash;for a wife! Cold, and unloving Woodville! Why did you ever feign a pa&s;&s;ion for me? Why &s;trive to make me think it &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in your frozen heart? You cannot bear remor&s;e! Ungrateful man! &s;hould not I have &s;hared it with you? Is then my fame le&s;s dear than yours? and did I he&s;itate one mo|ment to &s;acrifice that, and my&s;elf both, to you? Ob&s;curity and infamy were not bars to me, whil&s;t you, infirm of mind, de&s;ert the woman you pre|tend to love, for fear your wife &s;hould cry.</P>
<P>TRUE, madam, I replied, I would not give her cau&s;e to weep, for worlds&mdash;nay what is more, for you! You have acknowledged too, that the &s;tep your kindne&s;s prompted you to take, mu&s;t be attended with &s;evere regret al&s;o, on your own part. What &s;hould I feel then, from ren|dering you unhappy! I have not fortitude to brave &s;uch two fold agony.</P>
<P>O! you have half that guilt to an&s;wer for al|ready.&mdash;But my pride revolt at my own mean|ne&s;s. Leave me, Sir&mdash;leave me for <HI>ever,</HI> Wood|ville! I &s;hall obey you, madam, but before we part, <HI>for ever,</HI> &s;uffer me, at lea&s;t, to &s;atisfy your pride, by declaring that no man ever loved,
<PB N="36" REF="34">
with fonder pa&s;&s;ion than I now feel for you&mdash;how far time and ab&s;ence may be able to conquer it, I know not; but &s;hould they fail of their u&s;ual effects, it is impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould bear it long; and now, my I&s;abella one la&s;t embrace&mdash;may angels guard you!</P>
<P>I RUSHED out of the hou&s;e, like a di&s;tracted man, but had not walked a quarter of a mile, before the rectitude of my conduct towards this too lovely woman, began by flattering my pride, to qualify my pa&s;&s;ion; and I returned home, in a more rational &s;tate of mind than I have known for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>REJOICE with me, my friend; the conflict's pa&s;t! and be ju&s;t enough to acknowledge my triumph more compleat, than the much boa&s;ted one of Scipio. He only re&s;igned an <HI>alienated heart</HI>&mdash;while I forego <HI>a &s;elf devoted victim!</HI></P>
<P>I AM, this moment, going to &s;tep into the coach for Woodfort, where I &s;hall impatiently long to &s;ee you But, O write &s;oon, to &s;trengthen, and applaud my growing virtue.</P>

<P>BELIEVE me, Woodville, there is not ano|ther event within the power of fortune, which could now give me half the joy that I received from your la&s;t letter. I do congratulate my noble friend, my&s;elf, and all the world, on that heroic virtue, which has enabled you to pa&s;s

<P>I FIND my &s;tile, perhaps, too much elevated, by my &s;entiments, but &s;udden tran&s;itions mu&s;t have &s;trong effects. I had &s;carce a hope of your e&s;caping the &s;nare that was laid for you, and mourned your fall from honour, with infinitely more regret, than I &s;hould have done your death. Had the latter happened, my grief would have been &s;elfi&s;h; but in the other ca&s;e, I felt for tho&s;e pangs which you mu&s;t have inevitably &s;uf|fered; and for the mi&s;eries, which your crimes mu&s;t have inflicted, upon your amiable, and in|nocent wife.</P>
<P>BUT I do not wi&s;h again to recal this gloomy pro&s;pect to your view; you may now, and ought to look forward, to a long train of hapine&s;s; for &s;urely, if &s;uch a thing is to be found en earth, it mu&s;t ari&s;e from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, of having acted rightly.

<P>I FLATTER my&s;elf that this letter will reach Woodfort &s;oon after your arrival there, and that it will find my dear Emily rejoicing in the calm delights of dome&s;tic happine&s;s, after the &s;cene of hurry and di&s;&s;ipation &s;he has &s;o lately gone through.</P>
<P>I GIVE you credit for the lovely picture you have drawn of the marchione&s;s, and al&s;o for the tender concern you expre&s;s for the accident that be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">el her&mdash;but I am &s;orry your nerves were &s;o weak as to occa&s;ion your fainting.</P>
<P>I ALLOW much for your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, but do not let that, or any thing el&s;e, my dear &s;i&s;ter, &s;uffer you to indulge, in an habitual lowne&s;s of &s;pirits. There is an air of languid di&s;content, runs through the latter part of the little jour|nal, you were &s;o good to &s;end me, that alarms me much&mdash;yet I am certain you endeavoured to conceal your &s;entiments, even from me; and I approve your caution, as I am per&s;ua|ded, that by &s;peaking, or writing on any &s;ub|ject that affects us, we &s;trengthen our own feel|ings of it; and half the &s;imple girls, who are now pining for love by murmuring rivulets, or
<PB N="39" REF="37">
in &s;hady groves would forget the dear objects of their pa&s;&s;ion, if they had not a female confidante as &s;illy as them&s;elves, to whom they daily re|count the fancied charms of their Adonis, and utter vows of everla&s;ting con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>BUT do not now my dear Emily, &s;o per|ver&s;ely mi&s;under&s;tand me, as to &s;uppo&s;e that I would wi&s;h you to conceal any thing that di&s;|tre&s;&s;es you from me, or that I &s;hould de&s;ire you to let &s;orrow prey in &s;ilence on <HI>your heart,</HI> merely to &s;ave <HI>mine</HI> the pain of &s;uffering with you. No, I conjure you to &s;peak freely to me, and if I cannot cure, I will at lea&s;t &s;ooth your anxiety, if real, and endeavour to laugh you out of it, if imaginary.</P>
<P>WE have had a very agreeable vi&s;itor for the&s;e ten days pa&s;t at Straffon-Hill&mdash;lord Mount Willis&mdash;He lived abroad, chiefly in Italy the&s;e ten years; yet is not infected with foreign foppe|ries, and can reli&s;h both the food and manners of his native country. Sir John met him la&s;t, at Paris, from whence he is but ju&s;t returned.</P>
<P>HE tells us that Sir James Miller, and his <HI>cara &s;po&s;a,</HI> are univer&s;ally ridiculous. Her lady|&s;hip affects all the lively gallantry, d'une dame Francoi&s;e, but is unfortunately incumbered with all the clum&s;y aukwardne&s;s of a vulgar Engli&s;h-woman. Sir James plays deep, and has lo&s;t con&s;iderably. Lucy &s;eems hurt at the latter part of this account. The goodne&s;s of her heart is inexhau&s;tible.</P>
<P>THE approach of a certain de&s;irable event, with that of winter, will, I hope, &s;oon afford me the plea&s;ure of embracing my dear Emily and her lord. We &s;hall return to London in ten or twelve days. Have you made any di&s;co|very, in the <HI>terra incognita</HI> of Sir James Thorn|ton's heart? Does Fanny We&s;ton &s;igh in concert
<PB N="40" REF="38">
with the Aeolian lyre? or have the equinoctial bla&s;ts &s;o chilled her flame, that &s;he prefers a warm room and chearful company, to lonely me|ditation and &s;oft &s;ounds?</P>
<P>HOW does lady Harriet hear this &s;econd in|&s;tance of captain Barnard's perfidy? and how does the poor old gouty knight &s;upport the vul|garly called <HI>lo&s;s</HI> of his dete&s;tible wife? I find my&s;elf in a very impertinent mood; and that I may not a&s;k more que&s;tions in one letter than you may be inclined to an&s;wer in two, I &s;hall for the pre&s;ent bid you adieu.</P>

<P>YES, my dear Fanny, I am now, thank heaven, &s;afely arrived at Woodfort&mdash;would I had never left it! I think even the place, and every thing in it, is altered, during a &s;hort ab|&s;ence of twelve days. The trees have lo&s;t their verdure, and the birds cea&s;e to &s;ing. But though the autumnal &s;ea&s;on may have produced the&s;e effects, I begin to fear there is a greater change in me than in any of the objects that &s;urround me.</P>
<P>YET am I in the &s;pring of life, not ripened even to &s;ummer; while like a bla&s;ted flower I &s;hrink and fade. Say, Fanny, why is this? The animal and vegetable world bloom in their proper &s;ea&s;on, youth&mdash;while among&s;t tho&s;e whom we call rational, grief &s;teals the ro&s;es from the downy cheek, and flowing tears oft dim the brilliant eye. Lord Seymour is unhappy;
<PB N="41" REF="39">
Thornton &s;ighs; and my loved lord, &s;eems wretched,&mdash;need I go on and clo&s;e the climax, with my breaking heart.</P>
<P>CHIDE me, or chide me not, the &s;ecret's out; I am undone, my &s;i&s;ter! in vain lord Woodville &s;trives beneath the ma&s;que of tenderne&s;s, to act a part, which he no longer feels; the piercing eyes of love detect his coldne&s;s&mdash;his kind atten|tion is all lo&s;t on me, his &s;tifled &s;ighs belie his face and tongue, and whi&s;per what he &s;uffers when he &s;miles.</P>
<P>O, FANNY! tell me how I have offended him! how lo&s;t that heart, which formed my ut|mo&s;t bli&s;s! let me blot out that pa&s;&s;age, with my tears; it cannot it mu&s;t not be.&mdash;I will not live, if I have lo&s;t his love. Why are you not here, to flatter me&mdash;to tell me that my fears are ground|le&s;s, and that he &s;ighs from habit, or from chance?</P>
<P>AH, no I &s;ince he whom I adore has failed to blind me, I cannot, if I would be now deceiv|ed. Yet if I have erred, why does he not &s;peak out and tell me I have done wrong? Believe me, Fanny I have tried my heart, examined every hidden thought that's there, and cannot find out one that &s;hould offend him.</P>
<P>ARE all men thus incon&s;tant? I was too young to mark Sir John's behaviour, when you were married fir&s;t. A &s;udden ray of hope, now dawns upon me; perhaps the great exertion of my lord's &s;pirits, while he remained at York, may have occa&s;ioned a proportionate degree of lan|guor&mdash;perhaps he may again recover his natural chearfulne&s;s, and your poor Emily may again be happy&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I will &s;trive to hope the be&s;t.</P>
<P>I HAVE no thoughts of going to London&mdash;I always purpo&s;ed lying in at Woodfort&mdash;I had
<PB N="42" REF="40">
flattered my&s;elf, you would be with me, at that hour of trial; but I do not now expect it&mdash;I know Sir John would not con&s;ent to your run|ing the hazard of travelling, in your pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation, as it has formerly been of ill con&s;eqence to you, I therefore relea&s;e my dear Fanny, and de&s;ire &s;he may not &s;uffer the lea&s;t anxiety on my account.</P>
<P>I FIND my&s;elf much more at ea&s;e, than when I began this letter, and I mu&s;t affirm, though in contradiction to your opinion, that pouring forth our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, in the bo&s;om of a friend, affords, at lea&s;t, a temporary relief to the afflicted.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE never &s;ure was &s;uch a man as lord Woodville&mdash;he is not only determined to pre&s;erve my affection, but to rob me of the poor con&s;olation, of complaining that I no longer po&s;&s;e&s;s his. In &s;pite of all the pains I have taken to conceal the angui&s;h of my heart, he has cer|tainly perceived it, and by the mo&s;t tender and intere&s;ting conver&s;ation, had well nigh led me into a confe&s;&s;ion, of my being unhappy.</P>
<P>THANK heaven, I &s;topped ju&s;t &s;hort of that&mdash;had I avowed it, he doubtle&s;s would have a&s;ked the cau&s;e, and artfully have drawn me in,
<PB N="43" REF="41">
at lea&s;t, tacitly to reproach his conduct. O ne|ver! never, Fanny, can I be capable of that indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>BUT were I weak, or mean enough, to do it, I have now no rea&s;on for complaint&mdash;his tender|ne&s;s, politene&s;s, and attention, are unabated. No other per&s;on, but my&s;elf could po&s;&s;ibly per|ceive the &s;malle&s;t alteration in his conduct; and I begin to hope, that my apprehen&s;ions have had no other foundation, than an extremity of delicacy, bordering upon weakne&s;s in my|&s;elf. A thou&s;and, nay ten thou&s;and women, might, and would be happy, with &s;uch an amia|ble and tender hu&s;band, nor has your Emily a wi&s;h ungratified, but that of &s;eeing her dear lord quite happy.</P>
<P>I AM &s;orry to tell you that Sir James Thorn|ton leaves us to-morrow; he is to &s;et out immedi|ately on the grand tour. My Lord has in vain endeavoured to find out the &s;ource of his melan|choly; we can di&s;cover nothing but that he is un|happy, which I am &s;incerely &s;orry for, as he really is the mo&s;t agreeable accompli&s;hed young man, I ever was acquainted with.</P>
<P>LADY Harriet affects to appear thankful for her e&s;cape from captain Bernard; but finds his elopement a cau&s;e for &s;orrow, on his lady's ac|count. Sir Harry is &s;o much enraged, at his &s;on's neglect of him, that he begins to be recon|ciled to his wife's conduct, and &s;peaks of him, with more acrimony than of her. Indeed, I think Mr. Ransford highly to blame, for refu&s;ing to attend his father upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>FANNY We&s;ton is <HI>a la mort,</HI> at Sir James Thornton's quitting us. That love is the cau&s;e of her mourning, I well know, but I begin now to apprehend that Sir James, and not lord Sey|mour, is the object of her pa&s;&s;ion. She has a
<PB N="44" REF="42">
much better chance in this ca&s;e, than the other, for I am per&s;uaded if Thornton knew of her af|fection for him he would endeavour to make her happy.</P>
<P>ALAS! if he loves another, how impo&s;&s;ible! I fancy he is enamoured of one of the mi&s;s Wi|thers's.&mdash;His fortune and family are &s;uch, that I do not believe he would be rejected; yet I could not wi&s;h him &s;ucce&s;s for poor Fanny We&s;ton's &s;ake.</P>
<P>MEN more ea&s;ily triumph over an unhappy pa&s;&s;ion, than women.

<P>I AM per&s;uaded there is a great deal more in the&s;e local memento's than lovers are willing to allow. I therefore &s;hall not oppo&s;e Fanny We&s;|ton's going to London, if &s;he &s;hould again pro|po&s;e it.</P>
<P>SIR William and lady Law&s;on are to dine with us this day.&mdash;I will try to mu&s;ter all my &s;pirits to receive her. I would not, for the world, make her unhappy, by giving her the lea&s;t room to &s;u&s;pect that I am &s;o.</P>
<P>ADIEU, my deare&s;t Fanny; to you, and you only, I can, without blu&s;hing, di&s;cover all the weakne&s;s of a heart, that truly, and &s;incerely loves you.</P>

<P>P.S. I have this moment, received a me&s;&s;age from my lord, to let me know that he &s;hall &s;pend three or four days, in hunting, with Sir William Atkin&s;on. I am glad of any thing that can amu&s;e him.</P>

<P>I CANNOT expre&s;s how much my dear Emi|ly's la&s;t letters have affected and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me.&mdash;Your being unhappy is certainly &s;ufficient to render me &s;o; and what adds to my concern, is, my being ab&s;olutely incapable of affording you the lea&s;t con&s;olation, as I am utterly igno|rant of the real cau&s;e of your affliction. I &s;ome|times think, that it is only a phantom, conjured up by your too delicate apprehen&s;ions; and is, of cour&s;e, merely imaginary.&mdash;At other times, the natural con&s;tancy of men alarms me with an idea of lord Woodville's having met, at York, or el&s;ewhere, &s;ome object, that may, for a time, divide his heart with you.</P>
<P>OBSERVE, my deare&s;t Emily, that this is mere conjecture;&mdash;but we mu&s;t take certain po&s;itions for granted before we can rea&s;on upon any thing. Now do not &s;tart, when I tell you, I had much rather your unea&s;ine&s;s &s;hould ari&s;e from the latter &s;ource, than the former;&mdash;though I &s;hould con|&s;ider, even a tran&s;itory alienation of his affection, as a misfortune.</P>
<P>LET us now &s;uppo&s;e this to be the ca&s;e, and then &s;ee how far you have rea&s;on to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch an incident. The pa&s;&s;ions of the human mind, are, I fear, as little under our command, as the motions of our pul&s;e:&mdash;you have there|fore ju&s;t as much rea&s;on to re&s;ent your hu&s;|band's becoming enamoured of another per&s;on, as you would have to be offended at his having a fever.</P>
<P>BUT if, in con&s;equence of that delirium, he &s;hould &s;acrifice your peace to the gratification of
<PB N="46" REF="44">
his pa&s;&s;ions, by an open and avowed pur&s;uit of the beloved object; or otherwi&s;e render you un|happy, by unkindne&s;s, or neglect, you might then have &s;ome cau&s;e to complain; but if he be unfortunate enough to feel an unwarrantable pa&s;|&s;ion, and keeps that feeling all his own, his me|rit ri&s;es above humanity, and he ought to become almo&s;t an object of adoration to you.</P>
<P>HAS he not fled from this alluring charmer? Has he not hid his pa&s;&s;ion from the world, nor wounded even your pride? Is not his tenderne&s;s and kind attention &s;till unremitted towards you? Indeed, my Emily, allowing the&s;e to be matters of fact, you owe him more than you can ever pay. Con&s;ider what his regard to you mu&s;t be, that can prevail on him to &s;acrifice his pa&s;&s;ion, to your peace?</P>
<P>THEN do not, I implore you, my dear child, by even the lea&s;t appearance of di&s;tre&s;s, aggra|vate his, but be a&s;&s;ured, that from a heart, where honour is the ruling principle, you have every thing to hope, and that the tran&s;itory gloom which now affects him, will be &s;ucceeded by the brighte&s;t triumph; and that his rea&s;on and his virtue will both join in &s;ecuring his affection to you, upon a more &s;olid, and permanent founda|tion, than it could ever have been, if this acci|dent had not happened.</P>
<P>I HAVE gladly laid hold on what you will think the greate&s;t evil, lord Woodville's having conceived an involuntary pa&s;&s;ion. But formida|ble as they may appear to you, believe me, Emily it is of little con&s;equence, compared to both what he and you mu&s;t &s;uffer, &s;hould there be found no real cau&s;e for your di&s;tre&s;s. A mind &s;o unhappily turned, as yours would then appear to be, mu&s;t be incapable of receiving or admi|ni&s;tering
<PB N="47" REF="45">
content. I am &s;hocked at the horrid idea, and will not dwell upon it longer.</P>
<P>AS I kept your letters in a particular drawer of my de&s;k, in looking for your la&s;t but one, chance pre&s;ented me with your fir&s;t letter from Wood|fort, where you &s;et out a &s;trenuous advocate for the exi&s;tence of tere&s;trial felicity. Fallacious as the opinion may be, I am truly &s;orry you have had any rea&s;on to alter your &s;entiments; but let it, at lea&s;t, con&s;ole you, that if you are not an example of your own argument, there is no &s;uch thing as an exception to the general rule, that happine&s;s is not, nor ever will be, the lot of hu|man nature, till perfection becomes inherent to it.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubjects of this letter, have &s;unk my &s;pirits &s;o much, that I fear I &s;hall rather increa&s;e, than le&s;&s;en your depre&s;&s;ion, if I pur&s;ue them far|ther. I will, therefore, change to one that ought to give me plea&s;ure, and will, I hope, afford you &s;ome.</P>
<P>LORD Mount Willis, thoroughly apprized of our dear Lucy's former attachment to Sir James Miller, has declared a pa&s;&s;ion for her, in the mo&s;t polite and elegant terms, that can be imagined. Sen&s;ibility, he &s;ays, is, with him, the highe&s;t mark of virtue; and a heart, that could feel what hers has &s;uffered, for an unworthy object, mu&s;t be capable of the highe&s;t tenderne&s;s for one who can, at lea&s;t, boa&s;t the merit of being &s;en&s;ible of her charms.</P>
<P>A LITTLE fal&s;e delicacy has, as yet, preven|ted Lucy from declaring her &s;entiments, in favour of this charming man, for &s;uch, indeed, he is; though I can &s;ee &s;he likes him full as well, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily approve him much more, than &s;he ever did Sir James Miller.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="46">BUT Lucy declared &s;he would never marry, and that &s;he would leave her fortune to my Emi|ly.&mdash;I know this dwells on her mind, though it never did on mine; for I have as little &s;aith, in the vows of di&s;appointed love, as in the promi&s;es of &s;ucce&s;sful ones. However, I both hope, and believe, that lord Mount Willis will triumph over her &s;cruples, and that I &s;hall have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her the happy wife, of that very amiable man.</P>
<P>I AM &s;orry you are to lo&s;e Sir James Thorn|ton; but perhaps the want of his company, may induce lord Woodville to come to London; and I &s;hould rejoice at any cau&s;e that could produce that effect, for I cannot bear the thought of your lying-in in the country.</P>
<P>FANNY We&s;ton is not of a temper to break her heart for love; but I would, by all means, have her come to town. Her aunt, lady We&s;ton, talks of going to Bath, next month, and if Fanny chu&s;es to accompany her, I will an&s;wer for it, that that gay &s;cene of di&s;&s;ipation will &s;oon con|quer an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, whether lord Seymour, or Sir James Thornton be the object.</P>
<P>WE arrived in Hill-&s;treet la&s;t Thur&s;day; to|morrow, Sir John is to place my little Edward, at Eton. The &s;imple mamma will feel the lo&s;s of her dear play fellow, but the prudent mother will ble&s;s the memory of Henry the Sixth, who in&s;tituted that noble foundation.</P>
<P>THE accounts we have received of Sir James Miller, are &s;hocking.&mdash;He has been obliged to quit Paris, on account of his debts, and is re|tired into &s;ome of the provinces.&mdash;His lady re|mains in the capital, living away upon credit, without character, I begin to pity the unhappy man.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="47">YOU will ea&s;ily perceive that this letter has been written at different periods. The world breaks in upon me. I am embarked in the &s;tream, and mu&s;t be hurried away by the current, with &s;ticks &s;traws, and a thou&s;and other in&s;ignificant things.</P>
<P>ADIEU my dear Emily: I hope, &s;oon, very &s;oon, to &s;ee you&mdash;for, if <HI>the mountains will not come to Mahomet, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>I AM &s;incerely &s;orry for having given pain to my dear Fanny's gentle heart, as I cannot &s;ay that her participation has alleviated my di&s;|tre&s;s. For giving the fulle&s;t &s;cope to the argu|ments you have advanced, what do they prove, but that your Emily is unhappy; and that &s;he knew too well before! You &s;et lord Woodville's merits in the faire&s;t light, cruel Fanny! Why could you not find out &s;ome fault in him, to make me love him le&s;s? But it is impo&s;&s;ible; he is, without di&s;pute, the mo&s;t amiable of mankind.</P>
<P>I TOLD you, in my la&s;t, that Sir James Thornton was to leave Woodfort the day fol|lowing, which was Tue&s;day. On Monday night he took a very polite leave of us all, and I thought appeared more chearful than he had been for &s;ome time pa&s;t. When we were at breakfa&s;t on Tue&s;day, we were told Sir James had &s;et out at &s;ix o'clock; and immediately after my lords &s;ervant pre&s;ented him with a letter&mdash;he appeared to &s;hew &s;ome emotion while he read it,

I feel I know not what kind of a mixed &s;en&s;ation, for poor Thornton; I both admire and pity him.</P>
<P>I would have delivered the inclo&s;ed with my own hand, but feared my pre&s;ence might di&s;tre&s;s my Emily, or, perhaps re&s;train the pity-&s;towing tear, which, I confe&s;s, I think his &s;ufferings merit.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Sir</HI> JA. THORNTON, to <HI>Lord</HI> WOODVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>Indebted as I am for many obligations to your lord&s;hip, and &s;en&s;ibly awake to the warme&s;t &s;en&s;ations of gratitude, I could not think of quit|ting Woodfort, and England, for ever, without gratifying that friendly curio&s;ity, which has &s;o often &s;ought the cau&s;e of the too vi&s;ible change in my manners and appearance. You will per|haps be &s;tartled when I tell you, that this altera|tion is owing to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ignorant of every refinement, and elegance of life, di&s;&s;ipated in my temper, and unattached to any particular object, by your lord&s;hip's
<PB N="51" REF="49">
friendly invitation, I arrived at Woodfort.&mdash;Heavens! what a &s;cence opened to my a&s;toni&s;hed &s;en&s;e! The &s;udden effect of colours, to a per&s;on ju&s;t re&s;tored to &s;ight, could not be felt more &s;trongly. Every object I beheld, was new, was amiable! yet in this charming groupe, my lord, there were degrees of merit, and my then vacant heart dared to a&s;pire at the mo&s;t perfect of her &s;ex. Need I now tell you, that lady Woodville was its choice! Yes, I avow it! Pa&s;&s;ion is involun|tary; nor would I, if I could, be cured of mine.</P>
<P>Yet witne&s;s for me, heaven, that &s;en&s;ual and abandoned, as my pa&s;t life has been, no gro&s;s idea ever mixed with hers, nor did her beaute|ous form ever rai&s;e one thought, that even &s;he need blu&s;h to hear.</P>
<P>I DO not my lord, affect to place this puri|ty of &s;etiment to the account of my own ho|nour, or even my friend&s;hip for you. No, I con|fe&s;s my&s;elf indebted for it to her charming image, which ever appeared to my delighted &s;en&s;e, accompanied by that uncommon delicacy that graces every word and action of her &s;pot|le&s;s life.&mdash;That, like a &s;acred tali&s;man, has charmed the unruly pa&s;&s;ions of my mind, and made me only feel the pangs of hopele&s;s love.</P>
<P>Such a confe&s;&s;ion, as I have now made, my lord, will, I flatter my&s;elf, intitle me both to your regard and pity. I go &s;elf bani&s;hed from all that I e&s;teem, and love; from you and lady Woodville.&mdash;It would be the height of im|piety to doubt of her happine&s;s: and a long con|tinuance of the ble&s;&s;ings you now enjoy, is the kinde&s;t wi&s;h that I can make for you. Felicity like yours, admits of no addition.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="50">When you have read this, my lord, burn and forget it, but let the unhappy writer be totally bani&s;hed from your remembrance. Con|ceal my pre&s;umption, from the too lovely lady Woodville, le&s;t her re&s;entment &s;hould be added to the mi&s;eries of,</P>

<P>O FANNY, I am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed beyond mea&s;ure, by the&s;e two letters! Why did this weak young man place his affections upon me? Why not be&s;tow them, where they were likely, if not certain, to meet with a return? It is &s;aid, that love is involuntarily; but I believe it is only &s;o in very young or enervated minds.&mdash;If we will not &s;truggle with our pa&s;&s;ions, they will &s;urely overcome us; but they may certainly be weeded out before they have taken too deep root.</P>
<P>I AM doubly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, by this unlucky attach|ment.&mdash;Poor Fanny We&s;ton! her pa&s;&s;ion for Sir James Thornton is but to vi&s;ible;&mdash;Would it not be cruel to attempt her cure, by letting her into this &s;ecret? I know not how to act.&mdash;Why did my lord reveal his fooli&s;h letter? or why did he not &s;igh, in &s;ecret, and conceal his ill-placed love? O the&s;e audacious men! they dare do any thing.</P>
<P>THERE is however, a degree of mode&s;ty, in his keeping the &s;ecret, while he was here. I am convinced, if he had given the &s;lighte&s;t hint of it, I &s;hould have had dete&s;ted him: even as it is, I feel my&s;elf offended, and in a very auk|ward &s;ituation. I &s;hall certainly blu&s;h when I &s;ee my lord; and yet, why &s;hould I be humbled by another per&s;on's folly? What hu&s;band but mine, would have put &s;uch a letter into the hands of a wife? Such a mark of confidence
<PB N="53" REF="51">
ought to rai&s;e me, in my own opinion, as it is an undoubted proof, that I &s;tand high in his. Plea&s;ing reflection! dwell upon my mind, and bani&s;h every gloomy thought, that has obtruded there.</P>

<P>BUT the&s;e are not the &s;port of feelings, with which ma&s;ters and mi&s;&s;es, who fancy them&s;elves
<PB N="54" REF="52">
in love, are commonly affected; for though youth is the &s;ea&s;on, when we are mo&s;t capable of receiving impre&s;&s;ions, it is al&s;o the &s;ea&s;on, when they are mo&s;t ea&s;ily era&s;ed. I think I might venture to pronounce, that there are not five hundred couples in the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, who are married to their fir&s;t love, and yet I firmly believe there are, at lea&s;t, ten times that number of happy pairs; if &s;o, what becomes of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>TO be &s;ure we now and then met with a fool|i&s;h ob&s;tinate heart, that cheri&s;hes its own mi&s;e|ry, and pre&s;erves the image of &s;ome worthle&s;s object, to the la&s;t moment of its exi&s;tence. Among this &s;imple cla&s;s, I fear I &s;hall be nece&s;&s;i|tated to rank my &s;i&s;ter Lucy; for though &s;he does not pretend to have the &s;malle&s;t objection to lord Mount Willis, yet can &s;he not be prevail|ed upon, to give a final yes.</P>
<P>HIS behaviour, on this occa&s;ion is truly noble; for though I believe that never man was more in love, he has made it a point, both with Sir John and me, not to pre&s;s Lucy, for her con&s;ent. I fear Sir John will grow angry, at la&s;t, and per|haps hurry her into a denial, which &s;he will have rea&s;on to repent, all the days of her life.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, &s;he will now have &s;ome time to recollect her&s;elf, as Sir John has this day, receiv|ed a &s;ummons to attend his aunt lady A&s;ton, who is dying, and will probably leave Lucy a lage legacy:&mdash;That poor idiot, Sir James Miller has mortgaged the la&s;t foot of his e&s;tate; but then he has got rid of his wife&mdash;She died of a fever at Paris, twelve days ago. Upon the whole, I think fortune has been kinder to him than he de|&s;erved.</P>
<P>I AM much plea&s;ed with lord Woodville's be|haviour in regard to the letter; but indeed, my

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear SEYMOUR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been at home now above a week, yet have purpo&s;ely avoided writing to you, as your la&s;t interdicted me from mentioning the only &s;ubject of which I am capable of thinking. O Seymour! it is in vain to di&s;gui&s;e it; my head and heart, are filled with her alone! Upon the exertion of any painful act of virtue, we flatter our&s;elves that we have ab&s;olutely conquer|ed its oppo&s;ite vice, or weakne&s;s; our vanity triumps, and like the French, we frequently chant out <HI>Te Deum,</HI> without having gained a victory.</P>
<P>TOO much I feel that this has been my ca&s;e. I begin to fear that I &s;hall not even be capable of di&s;gui&s;ing my unhappine&s;s; and of practi&s;ing this di&s;&s;imulation, which in my &s;ingular &s;ituation &s;hould be deemed a virtue.</P>
<P>I HAVE di&s;covered that lady Woodville has lately wept much; I once &s;urprized her alone, in a flood of tears. I could not bear them: they reproached me, Seymour! but it was with &s;ilent angui&s;h; I pre&s;&s;ed to know the cau&s;e of her di&s;tre&s;s: had &s;he revailed it, and but once up|braided me, though in the gentle&s;t terms, I fear I &s;hould have thrown away the ma&s;k, avowed my pa&s;&s;ion, and quitted her for ever.</P>
<P>BUT her &s;oft nature knew not how to chide, and &s;eemed alarmed for fear &s;he had offended. Her &s;uffering gentlene&s;s unmanned me quite, or rather on the in&s;tant, it re&s;tored all that is wor|thy of the name of man, my rea&s;on, and my virtue: and I dare hope, that from that time,

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear WOODVILLE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;incerely &s;orry for your relap&s;ing into a &s;tate of weakne&s;s, which mu&s;t be always a &s;tate of mi&s;ery. I confe&s;s I thought you in the &s;ure&s;t train for happine&s;s, as the having con|quered our&s;elves, is the only &s;ubject I know for real exultation. But as your conduct has been truly noble, and that no per&s;on has &s;uffered from what I now con&s;ider as your own misfortune, no one can have a right to reproach you; and it is for your own &s;ake alone, that I now intreat you to &s;truggle with your too partial attachment to an unworthy woman,</P>
<P>YOU de&s;ire me to acquaint her with the &s;tate of your heart; can you &s;uppo&s;e me &s;o weak as to comply with your reque&s;t, were it within
<PB N="59" REF="57">
my power? But I mu&s;t travel &s;ome miles to af|ford the fugitive conqueror the triumph you de|&s;igned.</P>
<P>SHE &s;et out from London, five days ago, with your friend Ransford. I hear they intend mak|ing the tour of Italy together. Pro&s;perous gales, and calm &s;eas, attend them!</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee when a lady is bent upon travelling &s;he can ea&s;ily &s;upply her&s;elf with a Cici&s;beo; and I fancy that Ransford will be a much more agreeable companion, upon this party, than your lord&s;hip could po&s;&s;ibly have been.&mdash;He carries not the &s;tings of remor&s;e about him, the bane of joy, or peace! neglect of his father may &s;ometimes po&s;&s;ibly cloud his gaiety, but one glance from the bright eyes of the marchione&s;s will quickly di&s;pel the gloom.</P>
<P>WILL you forgive me for owning that I am tran&s;ported at their union? Would to heaven that you could receive joy from it al&s;o! Had &s;he fallen lower than &s;he has done, it might have mortified your pride; but if you can dive&s;t your&s;elf of &s;elf-love, you mu&s;t allow that Rans|ford is more calculated for a lover than you are. I think he bows with a better grace, &s;ings charmingly, dances &s;uperlatively well, is more <HI>adroit</HI> in his per&s;on, it above an inch taller, and has ten times your vivacity.</P>
<P>I BOTH hope, and believe, that they are married; and as Ransford does not want pene|tration, be may po&s;&s;ibly have di&s;covered your attachment to her; he will therefore probably prevent her returning to England, for &s;ome years. Let her but keep out of your way, and I care not what becomes of her.</P>
<P>DO, my dear Woodville, let me congratulate your e&s;cape from that Circe! and rejoice with you in the amiable character of her, whom
<PB N="60" REF="58">
Providence has de&s;igned to ble&s;s your future days!</P>
<P>I HAVE bu&s;ine&s;s that will detain me in London, for this month to come; the moment that is fi|ni&s;hed I will fly to Woodfort, and hope to find you and every one there, as happy as they ought to be; to wi&s;h for more is in vain.</P>

<P>YES, Seymour, I will own I have been mad; I wake as from a dream: yet why, my kind, my cruel friend, have you recovered me from that delirium, which, like an opiate, while it weakened, &s;oothed my enfeebled &s;en&s;e, and left me &s;carce a wi&s;h to &s;truggle with my mala|dy?

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear WOODVILLE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WRITE to you merely becau&s;e you de&s;ire it; for I am well convinced, that nothing which I, or the greate&s;t philo&s;opher that ever exi&s;ted, could &s;ay to you, would have any effect upon your mind, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate; and my own is, at this in&s;tant, &s;o extremely agitated, that I am &s;carce capable of writing at all.</P>
<P>I HAVE, this day, received a letter, from Captain Beaumont&mdash;The contents will amaze you. About &s;ix weeks ago, the acknowledged &s;on of madame de Beaumont, was taken ill of the &s;mall pox; and as her daughter had never had it, the general and &s;he thought proper to &s;end her to a friend's hou&s;e, le&s;t her beauty &s;hould be endangered by the infection.</P>
<P>THIS young lady, now about fifteen, who had never been out of her mother's &s;ight before, happened, in the family &s;he was placed in, to become acquainted with a young mu&s;queteer, hand&s;ome, and accompli&s;hed, but without rank or fortune. They quickly became enamoured of each other; and, at the end of a fortnight, eloped together, and got &s;afe into Holland. They might, po&s;&s;ibly, have been overtaken, and prevented from marrying, if the lady, to who&s;e care Maria Beaumont was entru&s;ted, had not dreaded the violence of madame de Beau|mont's temper, &s;o much that &s;he did not dare to inform her of the misfortune, till it was pa&s;t re|medy.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, the young, and by all ac|counts amiable, heir of the family, expired in
<PB N="65" REF="63">
his father's arms. The violent agitation of ma|dame de Beaumont's mind threw her into a rag|ing fever.&mdash;During her delirium, &s;he raved in|ce&s;&s;antly, on the ingratitude and ba&s;ene&s;s of Ma|ria, and her own inhumanity to the unhappy Charlotte.</P>
<P>THE general, who now con&s;idered him&s;elf as childle&s;s, gladly laid hold on the opportunity of endeavouring to recover tho&s;e he had formerly, <HI>not lo&s;t,</HI> but <HI>thrown away</HI>&mdash;he therefore prevailed on madame de Beaumont to &s;ee Charlotte. He went him&s;elf to the convent, and having declared his hitherto concealed affinity to Charlotte, he obtained leave from the abbe&s;s, to let her vi&s;it her dying mother.</P>
<P>BUT no tongue or pen can expre&s;s the various emotions of &s;urprize, grief, and joy, which were occa&s;ioned by the &s;ight of his lovely daughter, when &s;he ca&s;t her&s;elf at his feet, to receive his benediction.&mdash;Like poor old Lear he would have knelt to her, and begged forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT when &s;he pre&s;ented her&s;elf on her knees, by the bed&s;ide of madame de Beaumont, the unhappy woman, unable to &s;u&s;tain the &s;ight of &s;o much injured beauty, fainted quite away; but the moment &s;he was recovered to her rea|&s;on, &s;he called for Charlotte, and never let her quit her &s;ight, or cea&s;ed to pour forth ble&s;|&s;ings on her, and implore her pardon till &s;he expired.</P>
<P>BEFORE &s;he died, &s;he intreated Charlotte to quit the convent, and remain with her unhappy father while he lived. She de&s;ired that a di&s;|pen&s;ation from her vows might be immediately &s;olicited from the Pope, and that captain Beau|mont, and lord Seymour might be &s;ent for, in order to obtain their forgivene&s;s. But only one of her wi&s;hes was accompli&s;hed.&mdash;captain Beau|mont
<PB N="66" REF="64">
arrived, about two hours before her death; &s;he &s;aw, and ble&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>HE writes me word, that neither his father, nor him&s;elf, can prevail on Charlotte, to think of returning into the world again; but that &s;he has con&s;ented to go into the country with them, for a couple of months, merely in hopes of rocon|ciling the general to his younge&s;t daughter. He de&s;ires me to <HI>fly</HI> to Belville, that I may at lea&s;t &s;ee his &s;i&s;ter, before &s;he is again &s;ecluded from the world for ever.</P>
<P>O WOODVILLE! I want but <HI>wings,</HI> to obey him! But hark, my chariot wheels rattle, and my impatient heart, much more than beats re&s;|pon&s;ive to the hor&s;es feet.</P>

<P>I KNOW not whither to congratulate or con|dole with my dear Seymour, on the very ex|traordinary events that have happened in the Beaumont family. His feelings, I know, mu&s;t ari&s;e from tho&s;e of his beloved Charlotte; and I am, at pre&s;ent, doubtful, whether &s;he will ever again recover in the &s;ame degree, that peaceful re&s;ignation, which we may &s;uppo&s;e &s;he had ac|quired, and was in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, a few weeks ago.</P>
<P>ALL the pa&s;&s;ions of that gentle nature mu&s;t now be rou&s;ed to tumult; the &s;ight of her dear Seymour mu&s;t give her joy, tran&s;porting joy! which is as much an enemy to peace, as the mo&s;t

poignant mi&s;ery. And yet, again, mu&s;t &s;he be torn from all the &s;ocial ties of human life; again be buried in that <HI>quick</HI> &s;epulchre, a convent!</P>
<P>DO not, my friend, indulge a &s;ingle thought of her returning back, into the world.&mdash;It cannot be: Charlotte Beaumont will not be prevailed upon, even by the man &s;he loves, to break her vows to heaven: for though I believe her po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t exalted virtue, &s;he cannot, po&s;|&s;ibly, be free from &s;uper&s;tition, as &s;he is both a woman and a catholic.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lady</HI> STRAFFON, to <HI>Lady</HI> WOODVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>AS my dear Emily may yet be con&s;idered as an invalid, I think my&s;elf bound to write every day, and every thing that can po&s;&s;ibly con|tribute to her amu&s;ement, without expect|ing or waiting for any acknowledgment of my letter.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="67">SIR John returned la&s;t night, from paying his la&s;t duty to his aunt lady A&s;ton, and very well &s;he has paid him for his attendance. She has bequeathed to him the plea&s;ant manor of A&s;hfield, which is worth between eight and nine hundred pounds a year; and made him her re&s;iduary le|gatee, when he has paid her beque&s;ts of twelve thou&s;and pounds to Lucy, a thou&s;and pounds apiece, to my children, and &s;ome few legacies to old &s;ervants.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as Sir John had acquainted us with this agreeable news, he a&s;ked Lucy, if &s;he was yet determined, with regard to lord Mount Wil|lis? when, to my great plea&s;ure and &s;urprize, &s;he an&s;wered Yes, I think I &s;hall be ready to give him my hand before this day &s;e'nnight; though I cannot po&s;itively fix the day, as lawyers are dilatory folks.</P>
<P>SIR John then began to rally her, on what he imagined to be her attention to &s;ettlements, &amp;c. and told her that my lord and he would take care of all tho&s;e matters without her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She an&s;wered with a very &s;tedfa&s;t countenance and de|termined air, You will pardon me, brother; for once, and only once in my life, I am re&s;ol|ved to act for my&s;elf.&mdash;Now hear my re&s;olution, which I de&s;ire you will communicate to lord Mount Willis to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>WHEN his lord&s;hip did me the honour to ad|dre&s;s me, I had then but five thou&s;and pounds, a fortune much too &s;mall to be an object of con&s;i|deration, to him; but neither he nor you knew at that time, that I had but a u&s;e, even in that &s;mall &s;um for life.</P>
<P>SIR John attempted to interupt her, by inqui|ring what &s;he meant? &s;he begged that he would &s;uffer her to proceed without interuption, and went on.&mdash;The &s;evere treatment I met with at the
<PB N="70" REF="68">
&s;ame time, from Sir James Miller, made me at that time, re&s;olve that I would never marry.&mdash;We little know our hearts in many particulars of life; but lea&s;t of all in this.</P>
<P>BUT the extreme kindne&s;s I met with, at the &s;ame time, from lady Straffon, laid me under &s;uch indeliable obligations, as no time nor cir|cum&s;tance can ever efface. I then determined, nay declared, that I would bequeath my fortune to my niece Emily; and no power on earth &s;hall make me alter my re&s;olution.</P>
<P>FROM my aunt's unmeritted goodne&s;s to me, it is now in my power to fulfil my intentions be|fore my death, and to give a proof of that gra|titude, which I owe to my more than &s;i&s;ter. Again both Sir John and I would have broken in on her di&s;cour&s;e, but &s;he beckoned for &s;i|lence.</P>
<P>WHEN this, the fir&s;t wi&s;h of my heart, is accompli&s;hed, I &s;hall &s;till have a much better fortune than lord Mount Willis fir&s;t expected with me.&mdash;But it mu&s;t not be all his. Sir James Miller has been in &s;ome degree conducive to that happine&s;s, which I expect and hope for from an union with his lord&s;hip. Sir James is poor and wretched; ju&s;tly puni&s;hed for his crimes, but not rewarded, for the benefits he has conferred on me.&mdash;Some &s;mall provi&s;ion mu&s;t be made for him, without his ever knowing from whom he receives it. I formerly looked upon him with horror and aver&s;ion; I now con&s;ider him as my benefactor; and the &s;aving him from the mi&s;e|ries of extreme poverty, will relieve my mind from a &s;ort of mental debt.</P>
<P>SIR John could forbear no longer, but cla&s;ping her in his arms &s;aid, Providence had made him rich indeed, when it had be&s;towed &s;uch mea&s;ures on him, as his wife and &s;i&s;ter. Both he and I
<PB N="71" REF="69">
&s;aid every thing to di&s;&s;uade her, from her intend|ed gift to Emily, but in vain.</P>
<P>SIR John &s;eemed to hint as if he thought it would be better that her generous intentions to|wards Sir James Miller, &s;hould be executed by lord Mount Willis, rather than her&s;elf. By no means, brother, replied Lucy; were there a re|main of tenderne&s;s for him, in my heart, the world &s;hould not bribe me to marry its &s;ole lord. Genero&s;ity &s;hould flow from principle, not from pa&s;|&s;ion; and, as I can truly boa&s;t that this action, with regard to Sir James Miller, ari&s;es from the fir&s;t &s;ource, nothing mu&s;t change the current of it. My conduct on this occa&s;ion is, I think the high|e&s;t compliment that I can pay to lord Mount Willis, and I have not a doubt of his con&s;ider|ing it, in that high light.</P>
<P>WE both acquie&s;ced in her opinion, and Sir John waited on lord Mount Willis this morning, to inform him of Lucy's intentions. He &s;ays he never &s;aw any per&s;on &s;o tran&s;ported as his lord|&s;hip; he &s;aid he had ever looked upon Lucy as the mo&s;t amiable of women, but that her gene|ro&s;ity to Sir James Miller made him now look up to her, as to a &s;uperior being; and that if &s;he gave thou&s;ands he ought to give ten thou&s;ands, to the unhappy man, who had been in any de|gree in&s;trumental to his felicity.</P>
<P>THIS will be a whim&s;ical conte&s;t, I think, Emily, but I do not fancy that Lucy will con&s;ent to my lord's interfering with her de&s;igns. At pre&s;ent, &s;he intends to lay out four thou&s;and pounds, in an annuity for Sir James; which if he continues to live abroad, may &s;upport him de|cently.</P>
<P>I HAVE been this day to be &s;peak a pair of dia|mond buckles, and a very fine egrette, which Sir John and I mean to pre&s;ent her with. I know
<PB N="72" REF="70">
lord Mount Willis's family jewels are very rich, but my dear Lucy's virtues will out &s;hine them all&mdash;Indeed &s;he is an honour, not only to her &s;ex, but to human nature.</P>
<P>SHE joins with me in intreating yours, and lord Woodville's company at her wedding. Surely my Emily will not refu&s;e us both! you can have no doubts but that your little boy will be taken every po&s;&s;ible care of, and even a little month's ab&s;ence, from that dear face, on which your dotage hangs, will make an amazing change for the better in it&mdash;He will be as hand&s;ome again by the time of your return to Woodfort.</P>
<P>LUCY writes this night to lady Harriet and Fanny We&s;ton, to attend her nuptials,&mdash;All girls will fly to a wedding, &s;o that you will be left totally alone, if you are &s;o ill natured as to deny our reque&s;t.</P>
<P>WHO knows what a good example may do?&mdash;The pen&s;ive lady Harriet may perhaps be prevailed upon to &s;igh no more for her perjured &s;wain, but may po&s;&s;ibly be inclined to make &s;ome worthy man happy. As to Fanny We&s;ton I am per&s;uaded that the fe&s;tivity of a wedding will intirely conquer her hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion for the wandering Thornton. She is no Penelope, be|lieve me; and I fancy Mr. Wills, my lord's brother, will be able to bani&s;h the errant knight quite out of her mind.</P>
<P>ADIEU, my dear Emily. I hope you will make me happy in your next, by telling me that I &s;hall &s;oon have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you. Indeed I want nothing el&s;e at pre&s;ent to compleat my felicity.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM extremely charmed, but not &s;urprized at Lucy's conduct.&mdash;'here is every thing to be expected from <HI>&s;en&s;ibility</HI> and <HI>delicacy</HI> joined; but indeed I have &s;carce ever known them &s;epa|rated in a female heart. Refined manners are the natural con&s;equences of fine feelings, which will even in an untutored mind form a &s;pecies both of virtue and good breeding, higher than any thing that is to be acquired, either in courts or &s;chools; but when the&s;e two qualities receive every addition that education and example can be&s;tow,
<Q><L>" When youth makes &s;uch bright objects &s;till more bright,</L>
<L>" And fortune &s;ets them in the &s;tronge&s;t light;</L>
<L>" 'Tis all of Heaven that we below may view,</L>
<L>" And all but adoration is their due."</L></Q></P>
<P>THUS do I think of our dear Lucy; yet I mu&s;t &s;ay that &s;he has been uncommonly fortunate in having &s;uch an opportunity of exerting the noble qualities of her heart, and proving how much &s;uperior &s;he is to the dete&s;table meanne&s;s of ma|lice or revenge. Charming girl! may &s;he be as happy as &s;he de&s;erves!</P>
<P>SHE, as well as you, has intreated me to par|take happine&s;s.&mdash;Alas, Fanny! though grief is contagious, we cannot always symp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e with joy&mdash;&s;trange perver&s;ene&s;s of our natures, that accepts the evil, and rejects the good! Do not
<PB N="74" REF="72">
from this, &s;u&s;pect me of malevolence, or &s;up|po&s;e that I do not truly rejoice in Lucy's felicity. But there is, I know not why, a kind of weight that hangs upon my mind, which I find it im|po&s;&s;ible to remove. Perhaps change of place may help to &s;hake it off.&mdash;Be that as it may, I &s;hall certainly comply with your's and Lucy's reque&s;t.</P>
<P>MY lord has kindly promi&s;ed to accompany me, and our &s;weet little babe is to be left at lady Law&s;on's. Indeed, Fanny, you &s;carce can think what a &s;acrifice I make to quit him for a day; but he will be under the protection of the be&s;t of women.</P>
<P>I FEAR there is a &s;cene preparing that will trouble her repo&s;e. That bad mi&s;s Fanning! what a heart mu&s;t hers be? how void of gra|titude! and where that virtue is wanting, there can &s;ub&s;i&s;t no other.&mdash;Neither precept nor ex|ample can operate on ba&s;e minds.</P>
<P>IS it not &s;trange that nature &s;hould vary &s;o much in the human genius as to create a Lucy Straffon, and a Mary Fanning! &s;o nearly of the &s;ame age too; both de&s;cended from good fami|lies; and both well educated. The animal creation do not differ thus from their own &s;pecies. There are no furious &s;heep, nor mild tigers.&mdash;Nature is uniform in all her works, but man.&mdash;Haple&s;s variety! &s;ad &s;ource of mi&s;ery! the tiger and the lamb are not le&s;s &s;imilar than the betray|er, and betrayed&mdash;yet both wear the &s;ame form, and only by experience is the difference found.&mdash;Nay, &s;ometimes we have &s;een the faire&s;t face conceal the vile&s;t heart; as lurks the &s;erpent underneath the ro&s;e.&mdash;This is a mortifying &s;ub|ject; I will no more of it.</P>
<P>FANNY We&s;ton, as you gue&s;&s;ed, is in high &s;pirits, at the idea of Lucy's wedding.&mdash;She
<PB N="75" REF="73">
talks of nothing but dre&s;s, equipage, and jewels, ever &s;ince it has been mentioned&mdash;but a new &s;ubject is of infinite u&s;e in the country; and I do not know whether a great funeral had not en|tertained her quite as much.&mdash;Nodding plumes and painted e&s;cutcheons will amu&s;e the imagina|tion, when gilt coaches and gay liveries do not come in the way.&mdash;</P>
<P>HAPPY trifler! how I envy her&mdash;yet I am &s;ure &s;he loves Lucy, and fancies that &s;he is really enamoured of Sir James Thornton too.&mdash;I am certain that lady Harriet would gladly be excu&s;ed from going to London, but I will not &s;eem to &s;ee which way her inclinations tend.
<Q><L>" The &s;ilent heart, which grief a&s;&s;ails,</L>
<L>" Treads &s;oft and lone&s;ome, o'er the vales.</L>
<L>" Sees dai&s;ies open, rivers run,</L>
<L>" And &s;eeks, as I have vainly done,</L>
<L>" Amu&s;ing thought; but learns to know,</L>
<L>" That &s;olitude's the nur&s;e of woe."</L></Q>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lady</HI> STRAFFON to <HI>Lady</HI> WOODVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>I THINK my&s;elf extremely obliged to my dear Emily, for her compliance with her friend's reque&s;t.&mdash;You cannot conceive what delightful effects the hopes of &s;eeing you have produced in Hill-&s;treet.&mdash;Sir John talks of nothing el&s;e but the <HI>&s;parkler</HI>; you know he u&s;ed to call you &s;o.&mdash;Lucy is all gratitude for your kindne&s;s, and my little Emily holds up her head mo&s;t amazingly, that her aunt may ob&s;erve what a fine carriage &s;he has, and how much &s;he is grown &s;ince &s;he &s;aw her&mdash;The &s;ervants are all tran&s;ported with double joy for Lucy's wedding, and your arrival. In &s;hort, every one wears a &s;miling face, and I &s;hall not pardon it, if there &s;hould appear the &s;malle&s;t trace of gloom on yours.</P>
<P>I AM very &s;orry for what you hint at, with regard to lady Law&s;on&mdash;but be a&s;&s;ured, that a woman &s;hould be thoroughly convinced, not only of her hu&s;band's attachment, but of his morals al&s;o, before &s;he intrudes a female in|mate, younger, though perhaps not fairer than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE caution &s;hould be equally attended to, with regard to male intimates.&mdash;I have &s;eldom known an habitual friend&s;hip, that did not kindle, into what is called love, where there have been youth, beauty, and uncea&s;ing opportunity to fan the flame.</P>
<P>I THINK, if I were in lady Law&s;on's ca&s;e, I &s;hould not feel much&mdash;for the heart of a man who is capable of &s;educing a young creature, that is immediately under his protection, can never be worth regretting. I have always heard
<PB N="77" REF="75">
that Sir William is a very debauched man; and a truly delicate woman cannot pre&s;erve her af|fection for &s;uch a one, long&mdash;Contempt mu&s;t follow vice; and where we once de&s;pi&s;e, we &s;oon mu&s;t cea&s;e to love.</P>
<P>NOR do I look upon Mi&s;s Fanning as an ob|ject of pity&mdash;bred up, as &s;he has been, with &s;o excellent a woman, one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e her heart replete with every virtue;&mdash;but &s;he cannot, po&s;|&s;ibly, be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed even of the common merits, which we expect from a chambermaid, when &s;he can de&s;cend to pro&s;titution, without temp|tation.</P>
<P>HAD &s;he been led a&s;tray by an agreeable young man, I could have pitied, nay, perhaps, have loved, and even e&s;teemed her; for I am not &s;uch an Amazon in ethics, as to con&s;ider a breach of cha&s;tity, as the highe&s;t crime that a woman can be guilty of; though it is certainly the mo&s;t un|pardonable folly; and I believe there are many women who have erred in that point, who may have more real virtue, aye, and delicacy too, than half the fainted dames who value them&s;elves on the pre&s;ervation of their cha&s;tity; which, in all probability, has never been a&s;&s;ailed. She alone who has with&s;tood the &s;olicitations of a man &s;he fondly loves, may boa&s;t her virtue; and I will venture to &s;ay, that &s;uch an heroine will be more inclined to pity, than de&s;pi&s;e the unhappy victims of their own weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;ported my opinion upon this &s;ubject very freely; you mu&s;t therefore allow me to ex|plain my&s;elf more clearly. I know your delica|cy will be hurt if I do not; and I may expect to be &s;everely attacked by my dear little prude.</P>
<P>FIRST then I confine my fair penitents to the fir&s;t choice; a &s;econd error of this &s;ort is never to be pardoned.&mdash;Pa&s;&s;ion is the only excu&s;e that
<PB N="78" REF="76">
can po&s;&s;ibly be made for &s;uch a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and a woman who has made &s;uch a &s;acrifice to love alone may be perfectly &s;atisfied, that &s;he can never be &s;ubject to that pa&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame de|gree again. For there never is above one human creature that we can love <HI>better than our&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>THE woman who receives two gallants, is in my mind, quite upon a footing with the mo&s;t venal beauties; who&s;e capacious hearts &s;corn to be limited to any number. All married ladies I ab&s;olutely exclude from my order of amiable un|fortunates&mdash;they cannot even pretend to be de|ceived;&mdash;whereas a &s;imple girl, however mean her condition, may flatter her&s;elf, that her lo|ver's intentions are honourable. Old legends tell of king Cophetua and the beggar maid; and your Pamelas, and your Mariannes, encourage hope in young untutored minds, which perhaps the artful de&s;troyer takes the utmo&s;t pains to en|crea&s;e; <Q REND="inline">"'till they can tru&s;t, and he betray no more."</Q></P>
<P>THIS is, I confe&s;s, a nice &s;ubject for a woman to treat upon; but I promi&s;e you I will endea|vour to make my girl di&s;tingui&s;h between vice and weakne&s;s; and I hope while &s;he dete&s;ts the one, &s;he will be always ready to pity, and if in her power to protect the other.&mdash;There is no character I &s;o heartily abominate as that of the <HI>outrageou&s;ly virtuous.</HI> I have &s;een a lady render her&s;elf hateful to a large company, by repeating perhaps a forged tale of &s;ome unhappy frail one, with &s;uch a degree of rancour and malevolence, as is totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the calm dignity of real virtue.</P>
<P>HAVE you ever read a fable, which is bound up with Mr. Moore's, but was written by Mr. Brooke, called the Female Seducers? I think it
<PB N="79" REF="77">
the prettie&s;t thing that ever was written upon this &s;ubject.&mdash;To that I refer you for my &s;entiments at large.</P>
<P>YOUR remark upon the diver&s;ity of natures, among&s;t the human &s;pecies, is pretty and ingeni|ous;&mdash;but when we con&s;ider the amazing vari|ety there is in the animal creation, and how ma|ny of them are noxious, we cannot wonder that there &s;hould be &s;ome difference in human kind. Had we been all formed with equal virtues, tho&s;e very virtues would have been rendered u&s;e|le&s;s;&mdash;an in&s;ipid tamene&s;s would have prevented emulation, and life would have become a per|fect &s;inecure.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, were we all vicious, di&s;|order and confu&s;ion mu&s;t take place, and this world be quickly reduced to its primitive chaos. Without temptation, there could be no virtue; and without virtue, this world could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t.&mdash;We &s;hould not be &s;o much plea&s;ed with the gentlene&s;s of the lamb, if there was no animal more fierce, nor &s;hould we feel the &s;weetne&s;s of the woodlark's note, &s;o &s;en&s;ibly as we do, if we had never heard the &s;creech owl's voice, or the croak|ing of the raven. It is by compari&s;on alone, that we are capable of e&s;timating good and evil, both in the moral and natural &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I COULD illu&s;trate my argument, as fully among&s;t our own &s;pecies, as in the brute creati|on; but I have drawn this letter to &s;uch an im|moderate length, that I mu&s;t at lea&s;t defer the re|mainder of my di&s;cour&s;e, par&s;on like, to another opportunity.</P>
<P>EVERY thing is &s;ettled to Lucy's mind; and lord Mount Willis's happy day is fixed for Sa|turday

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHOULD have an&s;wered your letter by la&s;t po&s;t, but was prevented, by having company. The two mi&s;s Withers's &s;pent three days with us.&mdash;I told you before, they were charming women; but agreeable as I fir&s;t thought them, I now think them ten times more &s;o.</P>
<P>THE elde&s;t is extremely &s;en&s;ible, and perfectly accompli&s;hed, but of a grave turn; the younge&s;t has every merit of her &s;i&s;ter, with the mo&s;t en|gaging vivacity imaginable. She is &s;oon to be married to an Iri&s;h nobleman.&mdash;Happy man, who is to be ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a companion!</P>
<P>SHE &s;eems to feel &s;ome regret at the thoughts of quitting her friends and England; but &s;ays &s;he is &s;ure that her lord will be &s;o good to let her vi&s;it them &s;ometimes; and &s;he would by no means, wi&s;h to detach him from his native country, or prevent his &s;pending that fortune in it, which he derives from it.</P>
<P>MISS Withers is gone to Ireland, with her &s;i&s;ter. I am almo&s;t &s;orry that I ever was ac|quainted with the&s;e &s;weet girls, &s;ince I am to lo&s;e the plea&s;ure of their &s;ociety &s;o &s;oon. They told me a piece of news, which though it &s;urprized, did not di&s;plea&s;e me.&mdash;Mr. Ransford is married
<PB N="81" REF="79">
to the marchione&s;s of St. Aumont, and they are now in France together.</P>
<P>IS it not odd, that my lord never mentioned this particular, as it is no &s;ecret in the country? and he mu&s;t certainly know it, as he has been once or twice to &s;ee Sir Harry Ransford. But I think you de&s;ired me never to pry into his mo|tives for any thing; and I obey.</P>
<P>INDEED, Fanny, you appear to me to affect the &s;toic too much, from what you &s;ay about lady Law&s;on; but we can all bear the misfortunes of others with great fortitude,
<Q><L>" When they are la&s;h'd, we ki&s;s the rod,</L>
<L>Re&s;igning to the will of God."</L></Q></P>
<P>IN my mind, lady Law&s;on's trial is a very fie|ry one.&mdash;She is, &s;he mu&s;t be doubly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. As to the &s;light infidelities of hu&s;bands, I think the wife mu&s;t be contemptible who re&s;ents them; but every woman, that truly loves her hu&s;band, wi&s;hes to pre&s;erve his heart; and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his attachment to another object, mu&s;t be pro|ductive of the mo&s;t poignant angui&s;h. Happy, happy &s;i&s;ter! that have never felt that 'Hydra of calamity.'</P>
<P>I GRANT that Sir William Law&s;on has ever been a debauched man, but always had, except in this in&s;tance, &s;o much regard to his lady, to decency and humanity as to conceal his vices from her: He therefore, had not forfeited her e&s;teem, though &s;he had lo&s;t his love&mdash;O lo&s;s be|yond repair! Then her affection for that wretch mi&s;s Fanning, mu&s;t add to her di&s;tre&s;s. Not having been ble&s;&s;ed with children, &s;he looked up|on this worthle&s;s girl as her own daughter&mdash;and can &s;he in a moment forget the tenderne&s;s
<PB N="82" REF="80">
&s;he has indulged &s;o long, and dete&s;t the wicked couple, as &s;he ought&mdash;impo&s;&s;ible!</P>
<P>I AM really angry at your philo&s;ophic in&s;en&s;i|bility upon this occa&s;ion,&mdash;for my part, I can &s;carce behave with common civility, either to Sir William or mi&s;s Fanning. But lady Law&s;on, who is a &s;aint, behaves with her u&s;ual kindne&s;s to them both, nor has ever &s;eemed to have di&s;|covered or hinted the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion, of what is already too vi&s;ible to the whole country.&mdash;Yet her lovely face is emaciated and pale; and &s;ome|times, involuntarily &s;ighs and tears e&s;cape her.</P>
<P>I KNOW my lord is extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, on this occa&s;ion, he loves his &s;i&s;ter tenderly; but fears his interpo&s;ing might po&s;&s;ibly make Sir Wil|liam lay a&s;ide all re&s;traint, and perhaps, occa&s;ion a &s;eparation from his wife. I am glad, for this rea&s;on, that we are leaving the country, as I imagine mi&s;s Fanning's &s;ituation will make her removal nece&s;&s;ary, before we return to Wood|fort.</P>
<P>YOU need not have apprehended my di&s;&s;ent|ing from your generous &s;entiments with regard to the unhappy victims of love.&mdash;Nay I carry my humanity further, and feel for tho&s;e who, with|out &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, fall a &s;acrifice to the vile arts of their &s;educer, and their own weakne&s;s. That un&s;u&s;pecting confidence, which is too frequently the cau&s;e of womens ruin, mu&s;t certainly ari&s;e from a generous di&s;po&s;ition; and I &s;hould look upon a young innocent girl, who was armed at all points like a Moor of Moor-hall, to be an un|natural character.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, I dete&s;t a vicious woman, more than any thing in the creation; and for this rea&s;on, my compa&s;&s;ion does not extend to married ladies in general any more than yours.&mdash;They have always a protector to fly to; who
<PB N="83" REF="81">
upon that occa&s;ion, if upon no other, will with o|pen arms receive them&mdash;for though every man may not love his wife, every man is certainly jea|lous of his honour; and the fal&s;e notions of the world are, at pre&s;ent &s;o con&s;tituted, that the fai|lure of a woman brings infamy upon her hu&s;|band; while in a much more pitiable ca&s;e, it re&s;ts &s;olely upon the injured unfortunate.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, Fanny, I agree with you, this is too nice a &s;ubject for a female pen; though one is in&s;en&s;ibly led into reflections that are humilia|ting to an hone&s;t mind. But when he who knew the frailty of our natures, adjudged the convict criminal, his &s;entence was not &s;evere; for well he knew it was impo&s;&s;ible there could be found a wretch &s;o lo&s;t to humanity as to throw a &s;tone.</P>
<P>LET not the young, the gay, the rich, the fortunate, who&s;e &s;ituations in life have prevented their being liable to temptation, like an herd of deer, turn their armed brows again&s;t their wound|ed friend, and give her to the hunters!</P>
<P>MISS Withers and I were la&s;t night talking upon this &s;ubject, and &s;he repeated a little poem, that lord Digby, her &s;i&s;ter's lover, had &s;hewn her. It was written upon a particular occa&s;ion, at a water drinking place in Ireland called Mal|low, &s;ome years ago.&mdash;The unfortunate &s;ubject of it had been a much admired character in that place, a few &s;ea&s;ons before, and dignified by the title of Sappho.</P>
<P>THE lines are extremely pretty; turn over, and you will find them in the next page.</P>

<P>BUT there are certain &s;ituations in life, when our deare&s;t friends become irk&s;ome to us from an apprehen&s;ion that they may po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cover what we wi&s;h to hide.&mdash;There needs no other illu&s;tra|tion of my opinion, than a fair confe&s;&s;ion, that I have &s;ometimes, &s;een you under the&s;e very circum&s;tances, with your brother and my&s;elf&mdash;But I hope and believe you will never again ex|perience them. I may now &s;peak freely upon a &s;ubject, which though your virtue and goodne&s;s concealed, Sir William has thought proper to mention to my lord with every eulogium on your conduct, which, noble as has been, it could de|&s;erve.</P>
<P>MISS Fanning &s;et out for York&s;hire this morning, truly &s;en&s;ible of your goodne&s;s, and
<PB N="86" REF="84">
her own unworthine&s;s. Sir William &s;ays he is certain, that it is not in your nature to dete&s;t her as much as &s;he does her&s;elf. He told my lord that this affair was by no means &s;o unfortu|nate an event, with regard to you two as it might at fir&s;t have appeared to be; as your behaviour had not only made him e&s;teem and admire, but love you al&s;o, a thou&s;and degrees more than he ever had done before.</P>
<P>HE declared that he felt the impatience of a lover, to throw him&s;elf at your feet, and &s;aid he never &s;hould forgive him&s;elf for having ren|dered you unhappy by his infamous conduct. Joy, joy, to my dear &s;i&s;ter! will you forgive my &s;aying, that I envy your &s;ituation?</P>
<P>I WOULD give you an account of lady Mount Willis's wedding, dre&s;s, equipage, &amp;c. &amp;c. did I not know that your full heart can have no room to entertain &s;uch trifling ideas. But I am certain it will give you plea&s;ure to hear that lord Mount Willis is as amiable and accompli&s;h|ed as his charming bride, and that I think they have the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of a long uninterrupted cour&s;e of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>AS the hou&s;e of lords are now &s;itting, your brother purpo&s;es &s;taying in town, till March; but I may whi&s;per to you what I would not have him hear, that I cannot help regretting &s;o long an ab&s;ence from Woodfort, from my child, and from your&s;elf.</P>
<P>LADY Harriet, my &s;i&s;ter Straffon, and Fanny We&s;ton, pre&s;ent their more than compliments, and my lord joins in love and &s;incere congratula|tions, with your</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lord</HI> WOODVILLE, to <HI>Lord</HI> SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>IS it po&s;&s;ible that my dear Seymour can be &s;o totally ab&s;orbed in his own felicity as to make him entirely forget his ab&s;ent, his unhappy friend? I have been above two months in London, with|out hearing from you! Mi&s;s Straffon's marriage with lord Mount Willis brought lady Woodville and me to town.</P>
<P>I CONFESS I flattered my&s;elf that a change of objects and a &s;cene of di&s;&s;ipation, would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me, in conquering the gloomy di&s;ea&s;e that hangs upon my mind. Far from it, I think it has rather increa&s;ed my malady, by laying me under greater re&s;traints than I experienced at Woodfort; as all humours both of the mind and body, acquire additional force if they are denied a vent.</P>
<P>AS my ill fortune would have it, we are lodg|ed in the &s;ame hou&s;e the marchione&s;s lived in; and to add to my di&s;tre&s;s, there is a picture of hers, which was not fini&s;hed when &s;he went a|way, that is hung up in my dre&s;&s;ing room. As lady Woodville was coming to &s;peak to me ye&s;|terday morning, &s;he overheard me in earne&s;t di&s;|cour&s;e with the fair &s;hadow; &s;he immediately retired, &s;uppo&s;ing there was &s;ome company with me.</P>
<P>WHEN we met at dinner, &s;he &s;miling a&s;ked me who the lady was that came to vi&s;it me, in the morning. I could not for &s;ome time, conceive the meaning of her que&s;tion; but when from the naivet&eacute; of her di&s;cour&s;e, I under&s;tood it, I was all confu&s;ion, and your &s;i&s;ter lady Sandford, who was at table with us, gave me a look, that
<PB N="88" REF="86">
perfectly convinced me &s;he was acquainted with my folly.</P>
<P>THE inhuman marchione&s;s mu&s;t have reveal|ed my weakne&s;s to her.&mdash;Seymour could not be|tray his friend! Yet may I not from hence de|duce a kind of tacit compliment to my&s;elf, by &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he mu&s;t have been vain of her con|que&s;t, when &s;he proclaimed it? weak con&s;olati|on! like a drowning wretch, I catch at ru&s;hes!</P>
<P>WHY, why can I not tear her fatal image from my breaking heart! you have &s;een her, Seymour? It is a thou&s;and years &s;ince I beheld her&mdash;Have age and ugline&s;s yet overtaken her, or is &s;he lovely &s;till? Excu&s;e my raving&mdash;&s;uch I know it will appear to you.</P>
<P>I KNOW not whether I told you that lady Woodville had pre&s;ented me with a &s;on, before we left the country, and appears if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more amiable in the character of a mother, than before &s;he was one.&mdash;I rejoice to think that her being a parent has added to her happine&s;s, as well as her merit. Our virtue and our felicity are both increa&s;ed, by the diffu&s;ion of our affections.&mdash;What a wretch am I then, Seymour, who feel all mine concentered in one object, where they mu&s;t re&s;t for ever?</P>
<P>This reflection on my&s;elf is too &s;evere, nay mo&s;t unju&s;t! for I declare, that I am &s;en&s;ible of the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, for the lovely, the unof|fending lady Woodville and I would die rather than render her unhappy&mdash;At the &s;ame in&s;tant I adore the cruel, in&s;olent, ungrateful marchione&s;s. What tortures mu&s;t ari&s;e, from &s;uch a &s;tate of contradiction!</P>
<P>I AM truly impatient to know whether you have prevailed with your fair ve&s;tal, to renounce her vows, and enter once again into this world of cares? Be a&s;&s;ured I am &s;incerely intere&s;ted in
<PB N="89" REF="87">

<P>YES, Woodville, I confe&s;s it, I have been ab&s;orbed, entranced in the mo&s;t delightful delu&s;ion that ever lull'd the re&s;tle&s;s heart of man! I have pa&s;&s;ed three months in paradi&s;e! I thought not of the world, nor of its cares&mdash;I even grudged the hours that nature claimed for re&s;t, they robbed me of my Charlotte's tuneful voice, though her loved form oft vi&s;ited my &s;lumbers.&mdash;But the gay vi&s;ion is now flown, and I indeed awake as from a dream!</P>
<P>YOU may &s;uppo&s;e I reached Belleveue in as &s;hort a &s;pace of time as it was po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;My Charlotte was prepared to meet me. At our fir&s;t interview, through all the agonizing joy I felt, I perceived a &s;teady calmne&s;s in her manner, that &s;poke the tender, the indulgent friend, not the fond mi&s;tre&s;s: the gravity of her dre&s;s added dignity to her deportment, and awed even my tumultuous wi&s;hes into &s;ilence. I looked up to her, as to a &s;uperior being; and felt my&s;elf grow little in her &s;ight. She took advantage of my fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, and &s;poke to me in the fol|lowing manner.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee before you, &s;ir, the happie&s;t of her &s;ex, now fir&s;t permitted to indulge tho&s;e fond &s;en&s;ations, which nature plants in every human
<PB N="90" REF="88">
heart, filial, and &s;i&s;terly affection.&mdash;I will con|fe&s;s my&s;elf &s;till farther gratified by &s;eeing you, the only object of a pa&s;&s;ion, which took its ri&s;e in youth and innocence, but which has long &s;ince matured into the firme&s;t friend&s;hip, and rendered you&mdash;pardon me, my father! the fir&s;t, the con&s;tant object of my prayers.</P>
<P>BUT let not the fond wi&s;hes of a father, or your own de&s;ires, tempt you to think that aught on earth can move me to exchange the &s;tate of tranquil happine&s;s, I now enjoy for any other le&s;s pure, and more precarious. My vows were heard in heaven; they pa&s;&s;ed not forth from feigning or forced lips; for in the very moment I pronounced the words, my heart a&s;&s;ented to the pious &s;ounds, nor would I then have chan|ged my &s;ituation, even to be lord Seymour's wife.</P>
<P>Nor do I now repent the choice I made, though fully &s;atisfied both of your worth and love. Providence &s;eemed to have planted in&s;u|perable bars between us, at the hour when I fixed my purpo&s;e to renounce the world; and my then torn heart found its &s;ole peace in my humble acquie&s;cence to his will.</P>
<P>NOW mark me, Henry, this is the la&s;t time that I &s;hall ever &s;peak upon the &s;ubject, and it is in order to &s;ave your heart the pain of fruitle&s;s &s;olicitation, that I explain my re&s;olution. Should his Holine&s;s be prevailed upon, by my father's entreaties, to grant me the indulgence he has reque&s;ted, thus far I will, on my part comply with the general's de&s;ire.&mdash;I will &s;pend one, two or three months, with him in this hou&s;e, whene|ver he &s;hall command me; but my place of re&s;i|dence mu&s;t be the convent.&mdash;There I have &s;worn to live, and there I mean to die.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="89">THERE was &s;omething &s;o commanding and determined in Charlotte's voice and manner, even while &s;he denounced a &s;entence &s;o &s;evere, that neither her brother who was pre&s;ent nor I, attempted once to interrupt her. When &s;he had fini&s;hed, I found my heart &s;ubdued, and ready to &s;acrifice its very wi&s;h to whatever &s;eemed mo&s;t conducive to her happine&s;s. I was, alas! the fatal cau&s;e of the vows &s;he had made, how then &s;hould I dare to &s;olicit the breach of them!</P>
<P>TRUTH, Woodville, fla&s;hes conviction, even upon our pa&s;&s;ions, as &s;wift as light obtrudes upon the eyes. I in&s;tantly felt the delicate im|po&s;&s;ibility of her being happy in the world, and as quickly re&s;olved never to importune her to be wretched. It was not however without the &s;in|cere&s;t regret, that I beheld my mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of happine&s;s vani&s;h once more into air.</P>
<P>SHE received my acquie&s;cence with her deter|mination, as the highe&s;t mark of my affection, and told me that &s;he now con&s;idered me in a light, where the tendere&s;t regard for my welfare was compatible with her duty; and that hence|forward &s;he could know no difference in her affection for captain Beaumont and lord Sey|mour.</P>
<P>FROM that time, Woodville, our days have been &s;pent in the mo&s;t delightful intercour&s;e, and have &s;tolen away almo&s;t unperceived by me. Charlotte's voice, which was ever charming, is now &s;o highly improved, that no melody on earth can equal it. The good old general, who ab&s;olutely adores her, is frequently melted into tears while &s;he &s;ings; and upon all occa&s;ions gazes on her with a look of repentant &s;orrow and delight, as if con&s;cious of the injury he has done to the world, by robbing it of &s;uch an or|nament;
<PB N="92" REF="90">
while her charming countenance is lighted up with the animated looks of filial love.</P>
<P>SHE has prevailed on the general, to be reconciled to his younge&s;t daughter and her hu&s;band. He has obtained the young man's relea&s;e, and is to purcha&s;e him a commi&s;&s;ion immediately As &s;oon as that can be effected they will come here, and Charlotte will again retire into the convent, how do I dread the fatal hour of &s;eparation! and blu&s;h to think that even Charlotte's mind &s;hould be &s;o far &s;uperior to my own!</P>
<P>WITHIN the&s;e few days &s;he has frequently mentioned her going to Paris, with a look and manner almo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of impatience, yet cha&s;tened by the pain &s;he &s;ees it gives her father, brother and the unhappy Seymour. Mu&s;t &s;he agaid be torn from my fond eyes! Have I not &s;acrificed my wi&s;hes to her will, and will &s;he rob me of the la&s;t &s;ole delight of &s;ometimes gazing on her?</P>
<P>HER brother tried to prevail on her to let me vi&s;it her at the convent, but &s;he peremptorily refu&s;ed; nor will &s;he even con&s;ent to &s;ee him, except on particular bu&s;ine&s;s. Her father is the only per&s;on &s;he will admit within tho&s;e walls.&mdash;This is a &s;elf-impo&s;ed re&s;traint, for the abbe&s;s is perfectly inclined to grant her every indulgence &s;he can a&s;k.</P>
<P>I KNOW nothing of the marchione&s;s, Rans|ford, nor any other per&s;on at Paris. I &s;hall certainly accompany Charlotte thither; and when there, &s;hall acquaint you with every thing I hear about them. I am truly concerned that your in&s;atuation for that worthle&s;s woman &s;hould &s;till continue&mdash;O Woodville! had you lo&s;t &s;uch a trea&s;ure as I have, and by your own fault too, what would your &s;ituation have been! I
<PB N="93" REF="91">
will think of my mi&s;eries no more&mdash;but en|deavour to enjoy the &s;mall portion of happine&s;s that yet remains for me.</P>
<P>I CONGRATULATE you on being a father&mdash;may that tender tie awaken every plea&s;img &s;en&s;ation in your mind, and re&s;tore your heart to the amiable lady Woodville, who only can de&s;erve it!</P>

<P>ONCE more returned to Woodfort's peaceful &s;hades, e&s;caped from crouds and noi&s;e, to gentle conver&s;e, and the &s;weet mu&s;ic of my vo|cal woods; yet can I not enjoy the plea&s;ing &s;cene I have &s;o much longed for&mdash;the cau&s;e of my coming hither embitters the &s;atisfaction I hoped to find in being here. My Emily is in a bad &s;tate of health, occa&s;ioned as her phy&s;icians think, by the foggy air and hurry of London.</P>
<P>BUT, O Seymour! to you I will confe&s;s the &s;ecret woundings of my troubled &s;oul. I fear that &s;orrow preys upon her tender heart; for from the time of our being at York, I have fre|quently imagined her mind was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; but whenever &s;he &s;eemed to perceive that idea ri&s;ing in my thought, &s;he has in&s;tantly bani&s;hed it, by a&s;&s;uming an air of chearfulne&s;s and vivacity; and the tran&s;ition was made with &s;uch amazing ea&s;e,
<PB N="94" REF="92">
that I thought it impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould be in&s;in|cere, and that the gloomy medium of my own reflections, and not hers, had tinctured her appearance with an air of &s;orrow. Can it be po&s;|&s;ible, Seymour, that a creature &s;o young and innocent as lady Woodville, can be capable of di&s;gui&s;ing her &s;entiments, and hiding her grief in &s;miles!</P>
<P>I BEGIN to fear that women are our &s;uperiors in every thing. If &s;he has perceived my pa&s;&s;ion for the marchione&s;s, and concealed the angui&s;h which &s;uch a di&s;covery mu&s;t occa&s;ion to a heart like hers, for well I know &s;he fondly loves me, the &s;tory of the Spartan boy would no longer be repeated; but lady Woodville be henceforth con|&s;idered as the fir&s;t example of human fortitude&mdash;In what a light then mu&s;t <HI>her lord</HI> appear! I can|not bear the thought.</P>
<P>WHEN the phy&s;icians fir&s;t attended her, they advi&s;ed her &s;etting out immediately for the &s;outh of France, but &s;he refu&s;ed to go, with a more determined air and manner, than I had ever &s;een her a&s;&s;ume before. I imagined her di&s;like aro&s;e from the thought of being &s;eparated from her &s;on, and immediately a&s;&s;ured her that he &s;hould go with us. She thanked me for my conde&s;cen&s;ion, but &s;aid it had only removed one of her objec|tions, and that not the &s;tronge&s;t</P>
<P>THEN, with a tear ju&s;t &s;tarting from her eye, &s;he intreated that I would not pre&s;s her farther. I ki&s;&s;ed away the pearly fugitive, as it &s;tole down her cheeks, which was in&s;tantly lighted up, by the &s;oft glow of joy and mode&s;ty.&mdash;She told me, then, &s;he wi&s;hed to return to Woodfort, and, if I plea&s;ed, &s;he would go to Bri&s;tol when the &s;ea|&s;on came on.</P>
<P>I ACQUIESCED in every thing &s;he de&s;ired; and would at that in&s;tant, as I would at this,
<PB N="95" REF="93">
have laid down my life to procure her health and happine&s;s. We &s;et out immediately for this place.&mdash;For the fir&s;t three or four days I thought her better; &s;ince that I too plainly perceive that &s;he declines.</P>
<P>IF &s;he &s;hould die, Seymour, I &s;hall con&s;ider my&s;elf as her murderer. Surely you would then allow me the painful pre-eminence of wretched|ne&s;s, and acknowledge your &s;ituation, when com|pared to mine, to be like beds of ro&s;es to the rack. O no! it mu&s;t not be&mdash;&s;he &s;hall not die.</P>
<P>I NEVER was &s;o impatient for any aera, as for the month of June.&mdash;I have great hopes from the Hot-wells, my Emily's youth, and naturally good con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I HAD not the lea&s;t expectation that your Charlotte would have been prevailed on to quit the convent; indeed I &s;carcely hoped that &s;he would have conde&s;cended as far as &s;he has done, by con&s;enting to &s;pend a portion of every year at Belleveue. Happy Seymour! to have &s;uch a &s;ubject for expectation before you&mdash;It is &s;urely one of the highe&s;t degrees of human felicity to look forward with hope.</P>
<P>YOU will pardon me if I think there is &s;ome faint trait of the coquette in her refu&s;ing to &s;ee you at the convent. She certainly wi&s;hes to keep your flame alive; and as &s;he does not mean to feed it with any thing more &s;ub&s;tantial than her conver&s;ation, &s;he wi&s;ely thinks, that that, like all oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r enjoyments, might po&s;&s;ibly pall upon the ta&s;te if too often repeated.</P>
<P>SHE has therefore enjoined you a long fa&s;t, in order to heighten your reli&s;h for the <Q REND="inline">"fea&s;t of rea&s;on."</Q> You, I dare &s;ay, as a &s;till pa&s;&s;ionate lover, may probably think this little <HI>ru&s;e d'amour</HI> unnece&s;&s;ary; but I am firmly per&s;uaded, that

ab&s;tinence will enhance the value of our mental, as well as corporeal plea&s;ures.</P>

<P>I HAVE made an exchange directly oppo&s;ite to yours, having ju&s;t quitted the &s;weet &s;cenes of Belleveue and my Charlotte's delightful con|ver&s;e for the irk&s;ome crouds and noi&s;e of this great city.</P>
<P>THE young mu&s;queteer and his lady arrived at general Beaumont's, about a fortnight ago. Charlotte had fixed the time of her return to the convent, for the tenth day after they came, but her &s;i&s;ter, madame de Carignon, being taken violently ill, made her po&s;tpone her journey, and made me ha&s;ten mine.</P>
<P>FROM the time that Maria complained, Char|lotte never quitted her apartment.&mdash;Belleveue be|came a de&s;ert to me, and I fancied I &s;hould feel le&s;s regret, at being &s;eparated from her by di&s;|tance than accident.&mdash;But the effects are the &s;ame,
<PB N="97" REF="95">
be the cau&s;e what it may; for there is no place or &s;ituation that can afford me happine&s;s in her ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>YOU treat Charlotte very &s;everely, nay un|ju&s;tly, by charging the highe&s;t proof of her deli|cate affection to the account of coquetry. She is too &s;en&s;ible not to perceive that my pa&s;&s;ion for her renders me unhappy, and &s;he, though vainly, flatters her&s;elf, that time and ab&s;ence may effect a cure.</P>
<P>THIS &s;he in confidence declared to captain Beaumont, when pre&s;&s;ed by him to receive my vi&s;its.&mdash;Alas! &s;he little knows I would not change my malady for health; and yet I will conform to her pre&s;cription, and drink the bitter draught without a murmur. O Woodville! when we truly love, it is our highe&s;t tran&s;port to obey!</P>
<P>I AM truly concerned for the account you give of lady Woodville, but find a &s;ecret con&s;olation for her &s;ufferings in your &s;en&s;ibility; as I am al|mo&s;t certain that your tenderne&s;s properly exerted towards her, will re&s;tore both her health and happine&s;s.&mdash;I dare not tru&s;t my&s;elf with a doubt of your conduct upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I THINK nothing can be plainer than her knowledge of your attachment to the marchione&s;s.&mdash;Her po&s;itive refu&s;al of going to France marks it too &s;trongly. Woodville, I fear&mdash;but I will not reproach you&mdash;your own generous heart mu&s;t &s;ting you too &s;everely.</P>
<P>I HAVE this moment received a letter from captain Beaumont.&mdash;Madame de Garignon's di&s;|order appears to be the &s;mall pox; and as &s;he is pretty far advanced in her pregnancy, they think her life in danger. What has been gained by making her fly from that di&s;ea&s;e a few months ago!</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="96">BUT I have not time now to moralize. I &s;hall &s;end off a phy&s;ician immediately, and &s;hall follow him my&s;elf in a few hours; my Charlotte mu&s;t want con&s;olation, and is at the &s;ame time, the only per&s;on capable of admini&s;tering it to her unhappy father.</P>

<P>THERE certainly never was a more amiable creature than lady Woodville&mdash;&s;o una&s;&s;uming in her manners, &s;o fearful of giving pain, that &s;he would if po&s;&s;ible, conceal her complaints, even from her dome&s;tics who all adore her.</P>
<P>IS it not amazing, Seymour, that perfectly &s;en&s;ible as I am, of her uncommon merits, there &s;hould be found a being upon earth, who holds a higher place in my affection? How fal&s;ely do they flatter our under&s;tanding, who &s;ay that e&s;teem is the ba&s;is of love! if that were true, I &s;hould be the happie&s;t of men, &s;hould think no more of the ungrateful I&s;abella, &s;hould no long|er feel the reproaches of a wayward heart, which would then be entirely devoted to the charming Emily.</P>
<P>BUT though I may never be able, entirely to eradicate this fatal di&s;ea&s;e from my mind, I have great plea&s;ure in perceiving, that the con&s;tant ex|ertion of my tenderne&s;s towards Emily, is atten|ded with the &s;incere&s;t delight to my&s;elf; as it fulfils a duty and flatters my humanity with the idea of conferring happine&s;s upon an amiable and de&s;erving object.</P>
<P>THE practice of any virtue is not &s;o difficult as we are apt to imagine.&mdash;There requires nothing more than re&s;olution to commence.&mdash;Habit will &s;oon make it ea&s;y, if not plea&s;ant, to us.&mdash;Yet &s;till mu&s;t I envy tho&s;e, who have no need to &s;truggle; and when I behold the ingenuous fond|ne&s;s of lord Mount Willis and Sir John Straffon, to their wives, I cur&s;e my fate, and de&s;pi&s;e my own weakne&s;s, for having reduced me to the contemptible nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eigning what they are happy enough to feel.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="98">WE are to return the vi&s;its of our pre&s;ent gue&s;ts in our way to Bri&s;tol.&mdash;Lord Mount Willis has a very fine &s;eat in Somer&s;et&s;hire.&mdash;He is a very agreeable accompli&s;hed man. His wife before her marriage, loved Sir James Mil|ler&mdash;pa&s;&s;ionately loved him&mdash;and yet &s;he has withdrawn her ill-placed fondne&s;s and doats upon her lord. Shall I be weaker, weaker than a pu|ny girl? and &s;hall the voice of rea&s;on always plead in vain?&mdash;I dare not reply to the&s;e mortify|ing queries.</P>
<P>I MOST &s;incerely pity the unhappy general de Beaumont; his misfortunes have been multi|plied on him, at a time when he is lea&s;t able to encounter them. There is a &s;pring in youth, which makes us capable of re&s;i&s;ting almo&s;t any pre&s;&s;ure; but when a body, which has been nur&s;ed in the &s;oft lap of pro&s;perity becomes en|feebled by years, the mind al&s;o partakes of its enervation; and we have &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on to ex|pect a vigorous exertion of the mental powers, than of mu&s;cular &s;trength at three&s;core.</P>
<P>THE wi&s;dom therefore, that is in general at|tributed to age, ari&s;es more from a privation of pa&s;&s;ion, than from experience or any other cau&s;e. As the nerves grow rigid, the heart is in&s;en&s;ibly rendered callous. The exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations both of pain and plea&s;ure, after a certain time of life are imperceptibly blunted, by each returning day; and we at la&s;t become &s;olely indebted to memory for informing us, that we were ever capable of feeling the extremes of joy or &s;orrow.</P>
<P>THE only pa&s;&s;ion, which nature &s;eems to de|&s;ign &s;hould remain in its full force in our decli|ning age, is paternal affection; and as the others &s;ub&s;ide, I &s;hould imagine that gains &s;trength&mdash;there is a mixture too of &s;elf-love in it, which general|ly makes its exi&s;tence equal with our own. The
<PB N="101" REF="99">
objects of this affection are gradually maturing, under our fo&s;tering care; each day they make &s;ome advances towards our idea of perfections, a likene&s;s to our&s;elves; with anxious hopes we watch the tender buds look with delight upon the opening blo&s;&s;om, and gaze enraptured on the blooming fruit&mdash;It is our own, we planted, and we reared it! In this mo&s;t tender point, then the poor old general is now vounded; his armour and his brea&s;t plate thrown a&s;ide, the barbed ar|row &s;inks into his heart.</P>
<P>SHOULD madame de Carignon die, which I hope &s;he will not, there are abundance of good chri&s;tians, who would immediately conclude her death to be a judgment on him, for his inhuman treatment of Charlotte. But I, who confe&s;s my|&s;elf a &s;inner, have not a doubt of his having al|ready atoned his pa&s;&s;ive guilt, towards her by his contrition.&mdash;You are the &s;ingle per&s;on, who ap|pear to be injured by it,&mdash;for I am fully &s;atisfied, that Charlotte is no longer unhappy.</P>
<P>I HAVE philo&s;ophized and moralized upon this &s;ubject, to the extent of my time and paper, perhaps to prevent my entering again upon ano|ther on which I am neither philo&s;opher, nor morali&s;t.&mdash;I &s;hall therefore, fly from it by bid|ding you,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear WOODVILLE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MADAME de Carignon is recovered, if it can be called a recovery, for a fine young woman to &s;urvive her beauty.&mdash;That is indeed, ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed; but as her hu&s;|band's fondne&s;s &s;eems unabated by the lo&s;s, her homeline&s;s may po&s;&s;ibly become an advantage, rather than a misfortune.&mdash;Eew, very few wo|men, or men either have &s;trength of mind &s;uffi|cient to bear univer&s;al admiration; and when that is derived from beauty alone, there is &s;carce a young per&s;on who thinks it necce&s;&s;ary to attain any other qualification or accompli&s;hment, that does not tend to the embelli&s;hment of their charms.</P>
<P>I HAVE ob&s;erved through life, that we &s;eldom meet with an agreeable man or woman, who have been remarkably hand&s;ome. But perhaps, this may be philo&s;ophically accounted for.&mdash;As Providence acts by the &s;imple&s;t means, and beau|ty is alone &s;ufficient to procure the love and ad|miration of mankind, great qualities would be unnece&s;&s;ary to the purpo&s;e, and perhaps bar the original de&s;ign; for we &s;hould be more apt to fear than love <HI>a human being,</HI> that we con&s;idered as ab&s;olutely perfect.</P>
<P>I THEREFORE think with Milton, that where there

which may be a kind of con&s;olation to tho&s;e, whom nature has dealt her per&s;onal fa|vours to, with a &s;canty hand.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="101">IN the country where I am at pre&s;ent, neither youth or beauty are of much value. The grand|mother and grand daughter are pretty much up|on the &s;ame footing.&mdash;What little difference there may be is generally in the dowager's favour; as &s;he may probably be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more know|ledge and experience and a better fortune.&mdash;No woman is ever young or old at Paris; for the &s;ame paint that fills up the furrows of the aged cheek, hides the &s;oft down upon the youthful one.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee that a word to the wi&s;e is enough, and that I have followed your plan of philo&s;o|phizing, upon different &s;ubjects, to avoid re|curring to painful ones.&mdash;I mu&s;t however ac|quaint you, that I am to attend Charlotte to Paris, in three days. She has in&s;i&s;ted on my re|turning to England, as &s;oon as &s;he enters the cloi&s;ter; and I have con&s;ented, on her promi&s;ing to meet me here next &s;pring, provided the gene|ral be then living.</P>
<P>THE poor old man has in&s;i&s;ted on captain Beaumont's quitting the army, and taking po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his fortune, except a &s;mall annuity, which he re&s;erves for charitable u&s;es.

<P>I HAVE once more bid adieu to my dear Charlotte.&mdash;But painful as the hour of &s;epara|tion was, the recollection of what I had former|ly endured, from her entrance into the convent, with the fond hope of our re-meeting in a few months, have abated its angui&s;h; and &s;ome very extraordinary accidents, which have happened within the&s;e few hours, have taken up my whole attention, and carried me, as it were, out of my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE count de Clerembaut, for whom you know I have a &s;incere frind&s;hip, came to &s;ee me ye&s;terday morning.&mdash;He told me he was ju&s;t come from the tenis-court, where there had been a very warm <HI>brouiderie</HI> between two Engli&s;h gentlemen. One of their names, he &s;aid, was Ransford, who quitted the field to his antagoni&s;t, but with a look and manner, that &s;eemed to &s;ay, he was determined to meet him el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>I WAS alarmed at this account, and immediate|ly ordered my chariot, and drove to the marchi|one&s;s's. Ransford was not at home&mdash;I came back to my hotel, and wrote to him; expatiated on the ill con&s;equences of fighting a duel in Pa|ris; begged him to defer his re&s;entments, till his

<P>I INSTANTLY ran, or rather flew to the mar|chione&s;s, whom I found waiting dinner for Mr. Ransford&mdash;She &s;eemed &s;urprized at my entrance, as &s;he had heard that I had been there in the morning.&mdash;The anxiety of my countenance be|came contagious; and &s;he enquired with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, if I knew any thing about Mr. Ransford? before I could reframe a reply, the lieutenant de Police was on the &s;tairs, and I
<PB N="106" REF="104">
ru&s;hed out of the room to prevent his coming into it. He pa&s;&s;ed me by and entered.&mdash;She did not appear to be alarmed.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems there is a law-&s;uit between her and her late hu&s;band's heir, for part of her jointure; and &s;he, I &s;uppo&s;e, concluded that he came to execute &s;ome order of court relative to that affair. But long before he could fully explain the real motives of his coming, &s;he cea&s;ed to hear, and had &s;unk motionle&s;s upon the &s;ofa where &s;he &s;at.</P>
<P>THE lieutenant and his myrmidons took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing <HI>au nom du roi,</HI> and a&s;&s;ured us that diligent &s;earch would be made for the murderer. I intreated him to leave the unhappy lady's apartment to her&s;elf, and that I would be an&s;werable for every thing in it. He retired with infinite politene&s;s, which is the be&s;t &s;ub&s;ti|tute to humanity: and in this country, which abounds with &s;hew and delu&s;ion, is frequently mi&s;|taken for it.</P>
<P>AS the marchione&s;s is five months gone with child, it was thought proper to have her blooded.&mdash;Every po&s;&s;ible care has been and &s;hall be taken of her. She is di&s;tre&s;&s;ingly grateful for my &s;mall attentions towards her. But a mind &s;ub|dued by affliction is apt to over-rate every little mark of kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS unhappy affair will detain me here for &s;ome time longer.&mdash;I will not quit the po&s;t of guardian to the afflicted fair, till I re&s;ign her into Ransford's hands. You &s;hall daily hear from me.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lord</HI> SEYMOUR to <HI>Lord</HI> WOODVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>YESTERDAY pa&s;&s;ed away in forming me|lancholy conjectures on the recent cau&s;e of quarrel between captain Barnard and Mr. Ran&s;|ford; in intermediate ideas, whither he would bend his cour&s;e, and in li&s;tening to various re|ports which were variou&s;ly repeated by the friends, acquaintance, and &s;ervants of the un|happy combatants.</P>
<P>WE had however the &s;atisfaction to di&s;cover, that Ransford had made &s;ome provi&s;ion for his e&s;cape, as he had converted above three hundred pounds into po&s;t bills the morning of the duel, and had ordered a Swi&s;s &s;ervant who has lived with him for five years, and is remarkably at|tached to him, to attend at a particular place with a couple of the fleete&s;t hor&s;es he could hire, or purcha&s;e. From hence I conclude he will travel to Switzerland, and take up his abode at Berne, till he can return with honour and &s;afety into England.</P>
<P>YOU will perhaps &s;ay why at that particular place more than any other? I grant the idea is formed upon a vague conjecture; but Andre was born at Berne, and the Swi&s;s are of all nations, the Scotch not excepted, the mo&s;t &s;mitten with the love of their country. Ransford's mind mu&s;t be unhinged by this &s;ad accident, torn from its props, and ready to recline it&s;elf on the fir&s;t friendly &s;tay that will &s;upport it. The ho|ne&s;t Swi&s;s looks back with tran&s;port on tho&s;e barren hills where fir&s;t his mind found joy, his body &s;trength; and leads his ma&s;ter there to
<PB N="108" REF="106">
&s;hare the gifts which he received from nature, and the &s;oil. I &s;ay he will not &s;top till he arrives at Berne.</P>
<P>THE marchione&s;s does not agree with my opi|nion; &s;he thinks Bru&s;&s;els, Holland, Italy, nay England, more agreeable. That is, &s;he could like to &s;ix her re&s;idence, in any of tho&s;e places, rather than at Berne.&mdash;They are all equal to me, except England, where I am pretty &s;ure he will not go.</P>
<P>THERE were too &s;ealed letters found in cap|tain Barnard's pocket, the one addre&s;&s;ed to lady Ransford, the other to the man who killed him. I will wait upon her lady&s;hip to morrow to obtain the latter; it mu&s;t certainly throw &s;ome extra|ordinary light upon the affair.</P>
<P>I HAD written &s;o far when I received a &s;um|mons from the marchione&s;s to attend in&s;tantly. A thou&s;and apprehen&s;ions crouded on my mind; I feared Ransford might not have e&s;caped, and I knew the vindictive &s;pirit of his &s;tep mother too well to hope that &s;he would not pro&s;ecute. I found the marchione&s;s in a &s;tate little &s;hort of madne&s;s&mdash;her expre&s;&s;ions were &s;uch as made me rather fear than feel&mdash;her eyes darted fire, and &s;he traver&s;ed the circumference of her dre&s;&s;ing room, with the air and pace of di&s;traction: &s;he &s;eemed to be un&s;exed.</P>
<P>WHERE is he, madam? &s;aid I. Let me fly to him and try what gold can do, to purcha&s;e his enlargemant. This mu&s;t be our only re&s;ource; let them take it all, &s;aid &s;he, but let me go&mdash;a <HI>lettre de cachet</HI>! no monarch, nor no mini&s;ter dare &s;ign it&mdash;I will fly to Ver&s;ailles&mdash;it is already granted, and you &s;ee me a pri&s;oner at this mo|ment&mdash;dare you re&s;cue me?</P>
<P>AMAZEMENT took away the power of &s;peech: I did not under&s;tand her, it was impo&s;&s;ible I
<PB N="109" REF="107">
&s;hould.&mdash;At that in&s;tant, a per&s;on of a very gen|tleman like and engaging appearance, entered the chamber.&mdash;He &s;eemed to be a&s;toni&s;hed at her beauty, and perturbation, and gazed, for an in|&s;tant, fir&s;t at her, and then at me&mdash;at la&s;t &s;eem|ing to recollect him&s;elf, he addre&s;&s;ed me in thd following words.</P>
<P>I AM &s;orry your indi&s;cretion has permitted our meeting, Sir&mdash;It is true I have received no par|ticular information again&s;t you; you are, there|fore, at liberty to depart; which I beg you will do in&s;tantly, as you cannot be &s;afe in this hou&s;e a &s;ingle moment.</P>
<P>I IMMEDIATELY perceived he had mi&s;taken me for Mr. Ransford, and readily accepting all the good will he had &s;hewn to my friend's un|happy &s;ituation, returned him thanks for his in|tended humanity, and a&s;&s;ured him of my grati|tude, for a favour, which I did not &s;tand in need of. He blu&s;hed at his mi&s;take, and &s;aid that he had been twelve years in office, and had never exceeded his commi&s;&s;ion, but in that way. Strange, that a man &s;hould blu&s;h, that had been twelve years in &s;uch an office?</P>
<P>HE then explained his bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;He had a <HI>lettre de cachet</HI> again&s;t madame, which the mar|qui&s;s de St. Aumont, her hu&s;band's nephew, had obtained, to prevent her quitting the kingdom, till the &s;uit between them &s;hould be determined.</P>
<P>HER rage is not to be de&s;cribed; &s;he accu&s;ed the laws of inju&s;tice, and its officers of in&s;olence, and cruelty. A&s;ked to what pri&s;on a peere&s;s &s;hould be led, and whether &s;he was to be hand|cuffed like a malefactor? to all this intemperate language, the officer replied with great calmne&s;s, that her lady&s;hip might put an end to her di&s;tre&s;s, by giving &s;ecurity to the court for her &s;tay in Paris. She told him &s;he would not &s;tay for all
<PB N="110" REF="108">
the courts in Europe. He then &s;aid &s;omething in a low voice, about her being confined.</P>
<P>SHE had &s;ent for her lawyer, who arrived cri|tically, and prevailed on her, at la&s;t, to pa&s;s her word jointly with us, that &s;he would not quit Paris, without leave of the court, which he &s;aid he would apply for the next day.</P>
<P>THE agitation of her &s;pirits now &s;ub&s;iding, &s;he fell into violent pa&s;&s;ions of tears; bewailed her fate, and &s;aid &s;he was the mo&s;t wretched of human beings. I fear &s;he has more rea&s;on to think &s;o than &s;he is yet acquainted with. For after &s;he withdrew to her chamber, her lawyer, at my reque&s;t, explained the nature of the pro|ce&s;s again&s;t her, and a&s;&s;ured me that the late marqui&s;s de St. Aumont, had no power over tho&s;e lands, which he &s;ettled on her for a jointure; that he was, therefore, very glad to find &s;he was married to an Engli&s;h gentleman of fortune, as he had great rea&s;on to believe the cau&s;e would go again&s;t her.&mdash;That he feared &s;he was ex|tremely in debt, and that all her per&s;onalities were already forfeited to the crown, as being the &s;uppo&s;ed property of Mr. Ransford. What a &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, Woodville! and what will be|come of this unhappy pair?</P>
<P>BEFORE I left the hou&s;e, the marchione&s;s &s;ent for her lawyer into her chamber.&mdash;I took that opportunity of retiring to write to you, and &s;hall now clo&s;e this melancholy narrative with wi&s;hing you good night.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear WOODVILLE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BOTH my mind and my body are &s;o extremely harra&s;&s;ed, that I am &s;carce able to give you
<PB N="111" REF="109">
an account of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es in which I am in|volved.</P>
<P>JUST as I had &s;ealed my la&s;t letter to you, I received a billet from captain Beaumont, to in|form me, that the general and he were that mo|ment arrived in Paris, and that their coming was occa&s;ioned by a very alarming account they had received of my ever-dear Charlotte's being ex|tremely indi&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>I FLEW directly to the general's hou&s;e, and found the poor old man &s;inking under the double weight of years and &s;orrow. He &s;hewed me the abbe&s;s's letter to him, which &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that from the time of Charlotte's return into the convent, a fever had preyed upon her &s;pirits; that &s;he had concealed her illne&s;s for &s;everal days, and even made light of it when it was too vi&s;ible; that &s;he was now reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate of weakne&s;s, that the phy&s;icians had declared me|dicine could be of no u&s;e to her, and that an immediate change of air was the only chance &s;he had for life."</Q></P>
<P>NO words can expre&s;s what I felt on reading this &s;ad letter; yet will I candidly confe&s;s, that her father's angui&s;h &s;eemed to &s;urpa&s;s even mine. He called him&s;elf her murderer! and &s;aid if &s;he &s;hould die, he never could have hopes of mercy or &s;alvation.&mdash;Alas! am I not guilty as him&s;elf! My fatal ra&s;hne&s;s made her take tho&s;e vows, which her fond love for me, in any other ca&s;e, would have rejected</P>
<P>THE general determined to remove Charlotte out of the convent the next day, and convey her as far out of Paris as her &s;trength would permit. He intreated me to accompany them, in their melancholy and &s;low progre&s;s to Belleve&uuml;e. Judge of my di&s;tre&s;s, at being obliged to refu&s;e! But my honour was pa&s;&s;ed to a wretch who has none&mdash;

the marchione&s;s&mdash;Captain Beaumont promi&s;ed to bring me a faithful account of his &s;i&s;ter's &s;itua|tion in the morning, and I retired home&mdash;not to re&s;t.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN Beaumont was punctual to his word; he came to me before eight o'clock, and told me that his father and he had &s;een Charlotte, and found her in a very weak &s;tate; that &s;he had con&s;ented to &s;et out with them for Belleve&uuml;e, but that he did not believe they &s;hould be able to carry her farther than three or four leagues that day, and intreated me to go with them. I readily con|&s;ented, and determined that I would return to Paris that night, as &s;oon as ever Charlotte &s;hould retire to bed.</P>
<P>THE captain and I agreed to meet, at the ge|neral's hou&s;e, at eleven o'clock, to follow our fair fugitive, who was to &s;et out with her father from the convent. He told me that Charlotte had made a thou&s;and tender inquiries, about my health; that &s;he rejoiced at my being &s;till in Paris, and &s;eemed delighted at the thought of &s;eeing me that day. I needed not the&s;e new proofs of her regard to increa&s;e my ardour for her; my &s;oul was on the wing to meet her, yet &s;till the claims of friend&s;hip were not un|heard.</P>
<P>I RESOLVED to go immediately to lady Ranf|ford, for the letter that was addre&s;&s;ed to her &s;tep-&s;on, and found in Barnard's pocket. Then to wait on <HI>the marchione&s;s,</HI> and make my ex|cu&s;e for ab&s;enting my&s;elf from her the remain|der of that day: but though <HI>&s;he</HI> had left Paris, it was fated, that I &s;hould not quit it for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>AS I was coming out of my apartment, I was met by the lieutenant de police, who arre&s;ted me as an accomplice with the marchione&s;s, in having
<PB N="113" REF="111">
defrauded his maje&s;ty, by conveying away her mo&s;t valuable effects, which were confi&s;cated to his u&s;e, and having fled her&s;elf, though under an <HI>arret.</HI>&mdash;Never was a&s;toni&s;hment greater than mine.</P>
<P>IN vain I pleaded ignorance of the fact, or the innocence of my intentions, or offered to give ample &s;ecurity for tho&s;e effects, which had been &s;ecreted by that mean, that worthle&s;s wo|man! The officer told me he was not quite &s;uch an idiot, as the per&s;on who had taken my word before, and that no argument I could urge, would have the lea&s;t weight with him.</P>
<P>AS the la&s;t and mo&s;t prevailing rhetoric I of|fered him my pur&s;e, if he would go with me to general Beaumont's, and take his bail for my ap|pearance the next day; but he with&s;tood my gold, and even refu&s;ed to let me return into my apart|ment, to write an apology for not attending my beloved Charlotte.</P>
<P>THIS was the fir&s;t time, I had ever felt <Q REND="inline">"the in&s;olence of office."</Q>&mdash;I &s;ubmitted to it, though reluctantly, and was immediately con|veyed to the Chatelet.&mdash;I &s;ent off a &s;ervant to captain Beaumont, to de&s;ire him to come to me; but as &s;oon as I was lodged in pri&s;on, I was informed that no per&s;on would be admitted to &s;ee me, as they con&s;idered me as a delinquent of &s;tate.</P>
<P>I THEN demanded to be confronted with my accu&s;ers, and brought before a judge. They &s;miled at my ignorance, and told me, that as I was not in England I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to their laws, which were not quite &s;o expeditious as ours, and that patience would be my be&s;t re&s;ource for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THOUGH my temper is naturally gentle, and my pa&s;&s;ions have been long &s;ubdued by affliction,
<PB N="114" REF="112">
it was with difficulty I could command my rage&mdash;yet on whom &s;hould I vent it? on wretches brazed by cu&s;tom to the wild ravings of re&s;ent|ment, or the &s;oft plaints of &s;orrow!</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as I was capable of rea&s;oning with my&s;elf, I con&s;idered that a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own integrity ought to &s;upport me under the di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances I was involved in by another's fault; and am certain it would have done &s;o, had I not been di&s;appointed of the painful plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the lovely, languid Charlotte! I lamented the unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;he mu&s;t feel from hearing of my confinement, un|knowing of the cau&s;e; and the apprehen&s;ion of her thinking me guilty of &s;ome criminal action, and her &s;uffering from that thought, almo&s;t di&s;|tracted me. I cur&s;ed the marchione&s;s a thou&s;and times.&mdash;Yes, Woodville, from my heart I cur&s;ed her. Bane of your happine&s;s! di&s;turber now of mine!</P>
<P>WHEN I grew a little calm, I de&s;ired to &s;ee the keeper of the pri&s;on, as I wanted to know whither I was at liberty to write to the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, who I knew was then at Ver&s;ailles and to the re&s;t of my friends. The governor du Chatelet, was immediately announced, and on his entering, my eye was &s;truck with the mo&s;t graceful figuere and engaging countenance, I had ever &s;een. He &s;eemed to be turned of fifty, but had &s;uch a &s;oftne&s;s of features and complexion, as is rarely to be met with but in extreme youth. His appearance filled me with &s;urprize; I was amazed that &s;uch a man &s;hould be capable of &s;uch an office, which I &s;uppo&s;ed could not only be &s;uited to the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible or brutal natures.</P>
<P>HIS conver&s;ation was as plea&s;ing as his per|&s;on; he readily a&s;&s;ented to my reque&s;t, and &s;aid he would take care that my letters &s;hould be de|livered.
<PB N="115" REF="113">
He then gave orders that my own &s;er|vants &s;hould be permitted to attend me, and that any per&s;on whom I de&s;ired to &s;ee, &s;hould be im|mediately admitted. I thanked him for his hu|manity, in removing every unnece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint, and a&s;&s;ured him I &s;hould make no other u&s;e of his indulgence, than that of endeavouing to procure my liberty, by the mo&s;t legal means.</P>
<P>HE encrea&s;ed my a&s;toni&s;hment, by replying to me, in Engli&s;h, that he could not have any doubts of lord Seymour's honour; and that he hoped I would do him and his family the favour to dine with them, and allow them as much of my company as was convenient to me, while I remained in the Chatelet.</P>
<P>MY curio&s;ity to know &s;omething more of his family, made me accept his invitation; though heaven knows how little inclined to mix with &s;trangers, or enter into any plan of di&s;&s;ipation. I have written to the amba&s;&s;ader and to my dear Charlotte. By removing her anxiety I have le&s;&s;ened my own.</P>
<P>I AM not apprehen&s;ive that my confinement can la&s;t many hours; I will therefore endeavour to keep up my &s;pirits, with the fond hopes of flying to my Charlotte, the moment I am re|lea&s;ed. In the mean time, I attend the gover|nor's &s;ummons to dinner, and for the pre&s;ent bid my dear Woodville</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Belleve&uuml;e,</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>CHARLOTTE recovers daily; my fears for her precious life are abated. Your &s;i|lence now alarms me.&mdash;Why, mu&s;t I never be free from apprehen&s;ions, for tho&s;e I truly love? But I will, for the pre&s;ent, indulge your impa|tience, and re&s;train my own.</P>
<P>ON the fir&s;t day of my confinement, I was &s;hewn into the governor's apartment, which was elegantly furni&s;hed, and received by him and his lady, with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s. She was &s;urrounded by five beautiful children the elde&s;t a girl about &s;ixteen. I will confe&s;s it, Wood|ville! my eyes were in&s;en&s;ibly rivetted to this young creature's lovely form; and for the fir&s;t
<PB N="117" REF="115">
time of my life, <HI>my heart</HI> received a delight, from gazing on the charms of another woman, be&s;ides Charlotte!</P>
<P>I DID not long indulge the dangerous plea|&s;ure, without calling <HI>the wanderer</HI> to account, and &s;oon perceived that the fair Maria's chief attraction was owing to her remarkable likene&s;s to my Charlotte. This ob&s;ervation quieted my &s;cruples and left me the innocent &s;atisfaction of admiring her beauty, with a brother's eye. Yet &s;till my curio&s;ity was increa&s;ed by the re&s;em|blance; and as &s;oon as I was left alone with the governor, I took the liberty of a&s;king him if he was related to general Beaumont?</P>
<P>HE an&s;wered no; but &s;aid his wife was &s;i&s;ter to the late madame de Beaumont, though much unlike her both in mind and per&s;on; that he could well allow madame D'Angueville inferior in re&s;pect of beauty, but that her under&s;tanding and heart were fraught with every charm and virtue, that could adorn a woman.</P>
<P>I ASKED him had he never &s;een his niece Charlotte Beaumont? he an&s;wered with an ho|ne&s;t warmth, yes, Sir, when it was too late to make her happy, or reward your merit&mdash;would to heaven I had known her &s;ooner! I bowed and thanked him, even for fruitle&s;s wi&s;hes, and for a time forgot my being a pri&s;oner, from the delight I felt at being with one who knew and loved my Charlotte.</P>
<P>WE became totally unre&s;erved; and the go|vernor informed me, that he was of the N&mdash; family, de&s;cended from one of tho&s;e infatuated men, who had &s;acrificed their fortunes, and re|nounced their country to &s;erve a weak and worthle&s;s prince, who had neither inclination or power to reward their attachment.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="116">HE told me that his father had died of a bro|ken heart, while he was but a child; that his friends had with difficulty obtained him a com|mi&s;&s;ion in the Iri&s;h brigade, where he had &s;erved above twenty years without arriving to the rank of captain; and that he might have &s;till remain|ed in that &s;ituation, but that general Beaumont, by his intere&s;t, had procured him the po&s;t he then enjoyed, when he and his family had been reduced to the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THAT he hoped he had acquitted him&s;elf in his office, with humanity and compa&s;&s;ion; and by many circum&s;tances which he related con|vinced me, that none but a per&s;on of a noble and generous nature, was fit to pre&s;ide over the number of unfortunates, that guilt or accident impels to that gloomy man&s;ion. Sad reflection! that tho&s;e who are fitte&s;t for the charge, are mo&s;t aver&s;e to accept, and lea&s;t thought of for the office.</P>
<P>ABOUT &s;even o'clock in the evening, captain Beaumont inquired for me, and was immediate|ly admitted. His uncle mon&s;ieur D'Angueville, had never &s;een him before.&mdash;They were mutual|ly eharmed with each other. The captain told me, that as &s;oon as my &s;ervant acquainted him with my &s;ituation, he wrote a line to the gene|ral, to inform him of it, and &s;et out on the in|&s;tant for Ver&s;ailles; that he had &s;een the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, who promi&s;ed to wait on mon&s;ieur le duc de N&mdash;, the premier mini&s;ter, next morning, and obtain my relea&s;e as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble.</P>
<P>I THANKED my generous friend for his kind attention to my intere&s;ts, and pa&s;&s;ed the evening with tolerable chearfulne&s;s. The next day, about noon, I received a vi&s;it from Mr. S&mdash; &s;ecretary to our amba&s;&s;ador. He told me that his excellency had been with the mini&s;ter, and
<PB N="119" REF="117">
de&s;ired that I might be &s;et at liberty immediately. That the duc de N&mdash; had informed him it was impo&s;&s;ible to comply with his reque&s;t, as there was a criminal proce&s;s in&s;tituted again&s;t me for aiding and abetting the marchione&s;s de St. Au|mont, in open violation of the laws; and the only favour that could be indulged me, was the allowing me coun&s;el, and bringing the affair to a trial with the utmo&s;t expedition.</P>
<P>I ENDEAVOURED to make a virtue of nece&s;|&s;ity, and affected to appear contented with the very &s;mall favour that his excellency had obtain|ed for me. But not to make the repetition of my confinement as tedious to you as the time was to me, the day of trial came, and by the joint te&s;|timony of the marchione&s;s's lawyer, her &s;er|vants, and my own, I was acquitted of being concerned in her e&s;cape, but obliged to give bail for four thou&s;and pounds, which is the value &s;et upon the jewels, plate, &amp;c. which &s;he either car|ried off, or &s;ecreted.</P>
<P>THUS have I been injured, in my honour, per&s;on, and property, by my humane attention to that mo&s;t worthle&s;s of humankind. But no matter; and if the meanne&s;s of her conduct towards me &s;ets her in the light, in which I wi&s;h you to behold her, I &s;hall think my&s;elf overpaid, for every injury I have &s;u&s;tained on her account.</P>
<P>THE moment I recovered my liberty I waited on the amba&s;&s;ador, who had come to Paris, on purpo&s;e to know if he could be any way &s;er|viceable to me. I made my acknowledgments to him, and &s;et out that evening with my dear and indefatigable friend, captain Beaumont, for the loved place where my heart's trea&s;ure lay. I have already told you that I had the happine&s;s of finding her much better; and the joy which
<PB N="120" REF="118">
&s;he felt at &s;eeing her brother and me, has, I flat|ter my&s;elf, contributed to her recovery.</P>
<P>THE marchione&s;s's lawyer told me he had re|ceived a letter from her, dated at Bru&s;&s;els, wherein &s;he exulted at her own cleverne&s;s, in getting out of the power of the laws, and gave &s;ome dark hints, of her not being married to Ransford. Heaven grant that this may be true! The &s;uit with her hu&s;band's nephew will go again&s;t her; and for her contempt of the arret &s;he will be outlawed, and her whole fortune confi&s;cated;&mdash;&s;o that if, as I hope, &s;he is not Ransford's wife, &s;he may po&s;&s;ibly be reduced to her original poverty, and meet the contempt due to her vices from all mankind.</P>
<P>THIS is the fifth letter I have written to you without receiving a line from you. I have cer|tainly rea&s;on to apprehend that &s;ome fatal acci|dent has occa&s;ioned your &s;ilence, for I can never doubt the &s;incerity of your attachment to yours</P>

<P>PITY me! pray for me, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter! for heaven but mocks my prayers! had they been heard, lord Woodville's life had never been in danger. I am di&s;tracted, Fanny! I would that I were. Though angui&s;h &s;uch as mine &s;trains every &s;en&s;e, and racks my tortured brain, it will not crack! no, I am &s;till awake to all the mie&s;eries a wretch can feel, who doats and who de&s;pairs!</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="119">ON Tue&s;day &s;e'n night, fatal day! my lord received a letter from lord Seymour while I was pre&s;ent. I ob&s;erved that he was &s;trongly agi|tated while he read it, even to a change of coun|tenance and colour. I thought there mu&s;t be &s;ome extraordinary cau&s;e for his emotion, which perhaps he wi&s;hed to conceal from me; I there|fore ro&s;e &s;oftly from my &s;eat and attempted to re|tire.</P>
<P>O FANNY! can I ever forget the look of &s;or|row which he wore, when taking me by the hand he &s;aid, you mu&s;t not leave me, Emily! but &s;hare a painful office with your lord.&mdash;You mu&s;t endeavour to con&s;ole poor lady Harriet for Bar|nard's death; Ransford has killed him, and is fled from Paris.</P>
<P>HE then turned quick away, as if to hide his grief. It could not be for Barnard that he wept; and Ransford, he as well as I, believed he was &s;afe.&mdash;O there is another cau&s;e! let me not think of it, le&s;t it divide my tears, which &s;hould all flow for him, and not for my worthle&s;s &s;elf.</P>
<P>HE told me he would go directly to Sir Harry Ransford, to acquaint him with his &s;on's misfor|tune, and as he could not do it abruptly, &s;aid it was po&s;&s;ible he might &s;tay to dinner there, and begged I would take the mo&s;t immediate oppor|tunity of informing lady Harriet of this unhap|py affair. His hor&s;es were immediately ordered, and he rode off.</P>
<P>I SENT for Fanny We&s;ton to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in the painful ta&s;k I had undertaken. But why do I wa&s;te a moment in thinking of any object upon earth but one? About two hours after my lord left Woodfort, one of the &s;ervants who had at|tended him galloped into the court yard, ordered the chariot to be got ready in&s;tantly, and bid
<PB N="122" REF="120">
my woman tell me that my lord had fallen from his hor&s;e and much hurt.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;itting in lady Harriet's dre&s;&s;ing room when the &s;ound of the chariot pa&s;&s;ing ha&s;tily under the window alarmed me.&mdash;I rang to know the cau&s;e, when a &s;ervant pale as death, told me that my lord had met with a &s;ad accident. I cried where is he? and ru&s;hed out of the room. I was met by my woman on the &s;tairs. Lady Harriet, Fanny We&s;ton, and &s;he, prevented my running into the high-way; they poured drops and water down my throat. I knew not what they did or &s;aid to me.</P>
<P>AN expre&s;s was &s;ent off for a &s;urgeon, who arrived in le&s;s than half an hour after my lord was brought home &s;en&s;ele&s;s. They would not &s;uffer me to &s;ee him till he had been bled and his wounds dre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;But gracious heaven, when I beheld him!</P>
<P>LET me try to bani&s;h the &s;ad idea.&mdash;Alas! I fear it will never be effaced! never, my &s;i&s;ter, never, unle&s;s I live to &s;ee his natural form re&s;tored to my fond wi&s;hes, and my ardent prayers!&mdash;Oh, join with me, my Fanny! in earne&s;t &s;upplication for his precious life!</P>
<P>THE humane, the tender-hearted &s;urgeon, &s;aid every thing that could amu&s;e, but not di&s;pel my fears. That his wounds, though dangerous in his poor judgment were not mortal; but that he wi&s;hed for better help than his own.</P>
<P>AN expre&s;s was di&s;patched for Middleton or Ranby.</P>
<P>I CANNOT, but I would not if I could de&s;|cribe the night I pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;my lord remained quite &s;en&s;ele&s;s; enviable &s;tate! yet now and then his languid eyes fixed on me. About five in the morning he fell into a kind of a do&s;e, and re|mained in that &s;ituation till near &s;even, when he
<PB N="123" REF="121">
awoke in the mo&s;t violent delirium&mdash;he raved in|ce&s;&s;antly&mdash;<HI>but not of me.</HI></P>
<P>IN this mo&s;t melancholy &s;tate he has continu|ed eleven days&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"a burning fever, and a broken heart!"</Q> O Fanny, it is too much! but &s;hould he recover it I never &s;hall.</P>
<P>MR. Ranby and the &s;urgeon who fir&s;t attended my dear lord, have both a&s;&s;ured me that the hurt which he received from his fall, could not endanger his life. But neither they nor the Phy|&s;icians who vi&s;it him daily, can pretend to &s;ay what turn his fever will take. Strong opiates have been given, and at length have taken ef|fect; he &s;leeps, my Fanny! while I who have never clo&s;ed my eyes &s;ince the &s;ad accident, in|dulge them now in their once plea&s;ing ta&s;k of writing to my friend, my more than &s;i&s;ter! grief weighs my eye-lids down, but not with the &s;oft pre&s;&s;ure of an healthful &s;lumber.</P>

My heart almo&s;t breaks while I tell you, that the phy&s;icians have but little hopes of her life. During the fir&s;t one and twenty days of her lord's illne&s;s, &s;he never left his chamber, nor could even be prevailed upon to re&s;t her&s;elf, except for a few minutes, when quite exhau&s;ted on a couch.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;urprized lady Harriet and me mo&s;t was, that &s;he never &s;hed a tear, till lord Wood|ville fir&s;t recovered his rea&s;on and &s;poke to her. The &s;ervants who attended in his chamber have told me, that while he remained in&s;en&s;ible, &s;he u&s;ed frequently to lay her check upon the pillow, and ki&s;s his poor parched lips, as if &s;he wi&s;hed to catch the fever from him. O, madam! why were you not here to &s;ave her precious life?</P>
<P>LADY Harriet and I have been &s;o much u&s;ed to look up to her with re&s;pect, as well as love
<PB N="127" REF="125">
(and &s;ure no human being ever de&s;erved them more) that we could not attempt to oppo&s;e her re&s;olution, farther than by fruitle&s;s intreaties, though we knew it mu&s;t be hurtful to her&s;elf. Lady Law&s;on was unfortunately gone upon a vi&s;it, into Lincoln&s;hire, two days before my lord Woodville's accident, &s;he returned ye&s;terday, and is almo&s;t di&s;tracted at lady Woodville's illne&s;s. But what is her's, or any other per&s;on's grief to what my lord endures? no words can de&s;cribe his &s;orrow; and I am convinced, if &s;he &s;hould die, he never will recover.</P>
<P>HE in&s;i&s;ted upon being taken out of bed this day, and carried to her chamber. Doctor Fen|ton finding him peremptory, con&s;ented though reluctantly. Good God! what a pale and ema|ciated figure! Lady Woodville at fir&s;t did not know him: but when he &s;poke to her, &s;he &s;tart|ed up, cla&s;ped her arms round his neck, and cried out with unnatural &s;trength! My deare&s;t lord! this, this is kind! &s;he &s;hall not part us now! yes, we will go together; indeed I will not &s;tay for any thing on earth; no not for <HI>little Harry.</HI></P>
<P>HER &s;pirits became quite exhau&s;ted at the&s;e words, and &s;he &s;unk down in a flood of tears. We thought lord Woodville would have expired on the in&s;tant. He fainted, and was carried back to his chamber in that &s;ituation. This was the fir&s;t time that lady Woodville had mentioned her <HI>child</HI> &s;ince my lord's illne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Doctor thinks it a good &s;ymptom, and would have the little cherubim brought into her &s;ight&mdash;but who can an&s;wer for the con&s;equence if he &s;hould catch the fever from her. At this moment, &s;he &s;leeps, and lady Law&s;on is deter|mined to make the experiment; as &s;oon &s;he awakes.&mdash;God grant it may &s;ucceed.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="126">I HOPE my little cou&s;in has got the better of her &s;ad accident, and that I &s;hall not hear from, but &s;ee you as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I &s;end this by a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger, and &s;hall write every day till you come. I am, dear lady Straffon,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A RAY of con&s;olation beams upon us: lady Woodville's fever is abated; &s;he raves no more. The di&s;order &s;eems now to have fallen upon her nerves; and her extreme weakne&s;s is, at pre&s;ent the principal &s;ource of our apprehen|&s;ions for her. When &s;he awoke out of the &s;lumber &s;he was in, during my la&s;t letter, her recollection returned; &s;he knew lady Law&s;on, and every per&s;on near her; but &s;eemed particu|larly anxious to remember, what &s;he had &s;aid to her lord; and expre&s;&s;ed great unea&s;ine&s;s at doc|tor Fenton's having &s;uffered him to run the ha|zard of leaving his chamber.</P>
<P>LADY Law&s;on never quits her bed-&s;ide; and lady Harriet, who &s;eems to have forgotten all her own di&s;tre&s;&s;es, hardly ever leaves my lord&mdash;I am a &s;ort of courier between both; and by &s;lattering each in my accounts of the other, hope
<PB N="130" REF="128">
to forward both their recoveries. My lord ex|pre&s;&s;es the &s;tronge&s;t impatience to &s;ee lady Wood|ville: doctor Fenton will not con&s;ent to their meeting for &s;ome days, nor even &s;uffer my lord's letters to be delivered to him. I am called to receive a vi&s;itor&mdash;who can it be at this improper time?</P>
<P>WHAT a flutter am I in? You would never gue&s;s who this gue&s;t was&mdash;Sir James Thornton! but &s;o altered as I never &s;aw any creature! I be|gan to fear he was married; though what is it to me if he were? He has been poring his eyes out at Geneva ever &s;ince he left us; and looks as grave and as wi&s;e as an old profe&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r of philo|&s;ophy.</P>
<P>DO not be angry with me for trifling a little, my dear lady Straffon. I confe&s;s I was very glad to &s;ee him, and as lord and lady Woodville have had each of them a tolerable night, I think I may be allowed this &s;mall indulgence. I have a pre&s;entiment too, that my cou&s;in Emily is better.&mdash;In &s;hort, every thing &s;eems to wear a more chearful a&s;pect than it did ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>POOR Thornton was &s;o much affected at his friend's illne&s;s that the tears &s;tood in his eyes, and he offered up an ejaculation for their reco|very, with almo&s;t as much devotion as your lady|&s;hip could, though he is ju&s;t come from a place where they &s;ay religion is not much in fa&s;hion: but he is the be&s;t natured creature breathing, and I am &s;ure he prayed from his heart.</P>
<P>HE told me that a vexatious law-&s;uit had brought him to England, and that he meant to have returned to Geneva without &s;eeing lord Woodville or any of his friends; but being in|formed of the &s;ituation of this family, he had come from London on purpo&s;e to make the mo&s;t minute enquiries.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="129">HE begged I would not let lord or lady Wood|ville know that he had been here; &s;aid he would &s;tay a couple of days at Sir William Law&s;on's, in hopes of hearing they were out of danger, then return to town to pur&s;ue his law-&s;uit, and as &s;oon as that was over he would go back to Geneva&mdash;but I &s;hall u&s;e my be&s;t crow-quill, to try to per&s;uade him to vi&s;it Woodfort once more, before he cro&s;&s;es the &s;ea again; and if I &s;ucceed in that, I may perhaps try a little farther.</P>
<P>THIS is the la&s;t expre&s;s that I &s;hall &s;end, as I hope by next po&s;t, to be able to give you a &s;till more &s;atisfactory account of our dear, dear friends. Lady Woodville is very anxious about her niece.&mdash;I tell her, I hope with truth, that the &s;weet little Emily is much better.

<P>YES, I am &s;incerely glad too, that the little Emily has verified my prediction, and recovers

<P>OUR affections are not given us intirely for our amu&s;ement; they were certainly de&s;igned to make us feel our mutual dependence upon each other, and the total in&s;ufficiency of individuals to create their own happine&s;s. They are the links which form &s;ociety; and though, by being &s;tretched or broken they may give us pain, I am certain that we could have no plea&s;ure without them.</P>
<P>I THINK I have got off of this &s;ubject very well, con&s;idering that this is my fir&s;t <HI>coup d'e&s;&s;ai,</HI> in the moralizing &s;train.&mdash;Now for particulars&mdash;Lady Woodville &s;at up two hours this day&mdash;She looks weak and languid, but is, I really think, more beautiful than ever.</P>
<P>MY lord wrote her a few lines, which I had the honour of pre&s;enting to her; &s;he &s;eemed tran&s;ported with them, but, cruel as &s;he is, &s;he did not let any body &s;ee them. The doctor would not permit her an&s;wering them till to-morrow.&mdash;If &s;he &s;ends her letter by me, I &s;hall be mightily tempted to peep&mdash;but I will not&mdash;for I &s;hould not like to be &s;erved &s;o my&s;elf; and I think that is the be&s;t way of determining all doubtful matters.</P>

<P>ENCORE, my dear lady Straffon! do not you really think me very good natured? but this is now the hou&s;e of joy; and we, poor things, who have no character of our own, ca|melion like, catch the hue of our next neighbour.&mdash;No letter from you by la&s;t po&s;t&mdash;but no mat|ter. I have a little familiar, who tells me that Emily is better&mdash;thank you, good &s;pirit, for the plea&s;ing news&mdash;and now let me tell you, that lady Woodville is &s;o much recovered, that doctor Fenton is to leave us to-morrow.</P>
<P>I THINK I &s;hall be &s;orry when he goes; he is a pure chatty man, and I have &s;ome rea&s;on to imagine, that he likes me va&s;tly. Whenever I happen to be &s;ick, I will certainly &s;end for him.</P>
<P>WELL! matrimony is a fine thing, to be &s;ure! and it is very hard, that I, who am &s;o well in|clined to enter into that holy &s;tate, cannot find an help mate, meet for me. Though I have my doubts, whether there be many &s;uch hu&s;bands as lord Woodville. I declare he appears to be in|finitely more in love with his wife, than he ever was. Such tender attention, &s;uch unaffected fondne&s;s, I never beheld&mdash;He is never out of her chamber, but when he is obliged to leave her

<P>SIR James Thornton is a better corre&s;pondent than your lady&s;hip.&mdash;I received a letter from him, in an&s;wer to mine, with &s;ome very pretty compliments inter&s;per&s;ed through it, upon my ea&s;y manner of writing. Travelling, I find, has improved him; for I do not recollect that he ever &s;aid a civil thing to me before he went abroad. <HI>Better late than never,</HI> is a good proverb. Poor lady Harriet! her &s;pirits are very low, though &s;he has behaved &s;urprizingly well on Barnard's death; but I fear her calmne&s;s, on that occa&s;ion, was owing to the alarming &s;ituation of lord and lady Woodville; and that her grief will return with their health. I wi&s;h &s;he would think of marrying, a good hu&s;band would make her forget Barnard. Dear, good Thornton! ano|ther letter from him, and more flattery! <HI>quelle douceur! quel charme!</HI> Adieu, my dear lady Straf|fon, I mu&s;t indulge my vanity, this very mo|ment, by &s;hewing his epi&s;tle to lord and lady Woodville.

<P>THANK you, my good Fanny, for your two lively letters&mdash;they have been of infi|nite u&s;e to my poor weak &s;pirits; and though I may not be able to compliment as agreeably as Sir James Thornton, I will venture to &s;ay that I am as well plea&s;ed as he, with the ea&s;e and chear|fulne&s;s of your writing. I hope my heart is
<PB N="136" REF="134">
truly grateful to the Almighty, for the recovery of my dear &s;i&s;ter, and her lord, as well as for the re&s;toration of my little Emily, whom we now think pa&s;t danger.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ay, very ju&s;tly, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"our affections were not given us for amu&s;ement."</Q>
No, Fan|ny! they were meant to humble the proud heart; to &s;hew us our own weakne&s;s and fallibility, by our frequently be&s;towing them on unworthy or improper objects; and even when directed by nature, and rea&s;on, into their right cour&s;e, to all the tender charities of life, they &s;hould re|mind us of our intire dependence, on the great Author of our being, by making us &s;en&s;ible that the mo&s;t delightful attachments, which can be formed, by love or friend&s;hip, &s;erve but to en|large our vulnerary part, and encrea&s;e our capa|city of feeling pain.</P>
<P>YOU, perhaps, may think this moral too &s;e|vere, but it is not meant to re&s;train us from the indulgence of tho&s;e fond &s;en&s;ations, which are natural to every good heart, but to rai&s;e our gra|titude, to the great Giver of all our ble&s;&s;ings, and to remind us, that we hold them, by grant, from his bounty, and not from any right, or me|rit of our own.</P>
<P>AS my Emily gains &s;trength every day, we purpo&s;e going into E&s;&s;ex, in a &s;hort time; and as &s;oon as Sir John can &s;ettle &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary affairs there, we &s;hall all &s;et out for Bri&s;tol in hopes of meeting lord and lady Woodville there.&mdash;What a joyful meeting will it be to me! my eyes run over at the delightful idea.</P>
<P>THOUGH lady Mount Willis took every pre|caution to conceal her genero&s;ity to Sir James Miller from him&s;elf, the unhappy man has di&s;|covered that he is indebted to her for his &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, and has written her a mo&s;t affecting letter,
<PB N="137" REF="135">
acknowledging his own unworthine&s;s, and in|treating her to withdraw her bounty, as he de|clares he could better &s;upport the mo&s;t abject poverty, than the receiving of favours from one, whom he had &s;o highly injured and offended. There is &s;omething in this &s;entiment that inclines me to forgive, even his former ba&s;ene&s;s, and to pity his pre&s;ent mi&s;ery. Sure there can be no|thing &s;o truly humiliating as receiving obligations from tho&s;e we have wronged.</P>
<P>I SINCERELY wi&s;h that your epi&s;tolary cor|re&s;pondence with Sir James Thornton may an|&s;wer all your expectation.&mdash;But, remember, Fanny, that flattery co&s;ts men nothing; and that women are apt to over-rate it, and frequently be&s;tow their love and e&s;teem in exchange for what has no aintrin&s;ic worth. I grant that in the general commerce of the world, the per&s;on who&s;e politene&s;s and attention are mo&s;t marked to us, de&s;ervedly obtains a preference in our re|gard: vanity is in &s;ome degree inherent to all human kind, and the being rated above our fel|lows, is a &s;pecies of flattery, which the mo&s;t delicate creature in the world is never offended at. But in a particular intercour&s;e between man and woman, we &s;hould take great care, that our own &s;elf-love does not impo&s;e upon us, and mag|nify the common forms or expre&s;&s;ions of polite|ne&s;s into a particular addre&s;s.&mdash;Do not be angry at this hint, Fanny, as it is only meant to &s;ave your vanity, for I hope your heart is not yet concerned, from the mortification of a di&s;appoint|ment.</P>
<P>Tell my dear lady Woodville, that I mo&s;t im|patiently long for a line from her, and that I mu|tually congratulate her lord, and her on their re|covery. I am, dear Fanny your's &s;incerely.</P>

<P>LIKE the rich gales from the Arabian coa&s;t my Emily's la&s;t letter came fraught with health and joy.&mdash;What an high cordial mu&s;t it have been to a fond &s;i&s;ter's heart, who long has mourned, without affecting to perceive tho&s;e &s;ecret &s;orrows which &s;he could not heal, to hear that they at length have vani&s;hed?</P>
<P>I KNOW not which of us is at pre&s;ent happi|e&s;t; but were the charming conte&s;t to be deter|mined by the merit of the competitors, the pre|cious palm would be adjudged to you. Long may my Emily enjoy the triumph &s;he &s;o well de&s;erves!</P>
<P>I WILL not, cannot wait for a detail of your felicity; I will behold and &s;hare it.&mdash;It is po&s;&s;ible to be circum&s;tantial under the &s;evere&s;t affliction; but happine&s;s is by much too volatile for narra|tive&mdash;like a fine and &s;ubtile e&s;&s;ence, it evaporates through the activity of its own &s;pirit; we can|not paint the expre&s;&s;ive looks which are lighted up by a glad heart; the <HI>eye</HI> alone can catch the brilliant beam, which brightens by reflection&mdash;
<PB N="141" REF="139">
Therefore expect to meet mine in le&s;s than four and twenty hours after you receive this. Sir John and my girl will accompany me.</P>
<P>I HAVE had a very plea&s;ing letter from lady Somerville.&mdash;Lodovico, Laura, and &s;he arrived &s;afe at Genoa; her friends received them all with open heart and arms.&mdash;The young people have been entirely taken up with fea&s;ts, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters"> and ma&s;querades. To avoid giving offence by refu&s;ing to partake in the&s;e amu&s;ements, lady Somerville has retired to the very hou&s;e which &s;he quitted upon her marriage, which is twenty leagues from Genoa.&mdash;She there continues to indulge that melancholy which time has been on|ly able to &s;often, not &s;ubdue&mdash;amiable relict!</P>
<P>TELL Fanny We&s;ton that the pre&s;ent harmo|ny of my &s;pirits prevents my an&s;wering her letter as I ought; but &s;he mu&s;t not flatter her|&s;elf that I do not mean to take any further no|tice of it; for the moment I become acquainted with Sir James Thornton, I will in&s;i&s;t upon his devi&s;ing a proper puni&s;hment for her pertne&s;s, and he &s;hall be at once the judge and the ex|ecutioner.</P>
<P>ADIEU, my dear Emily: I quit you with plea&s;ure, at this moment, to ha&s;ten to that of our meeting.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lord</HI> WOODVILLE to <HI>Lord</HI> SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>THE apprehen&s;ions which my dear Seymour expre&s;&s;es on account of my &s;ilence have been but too well founded&mdash;I have been upon the verge of <Q REND="inline">"that undi&s;covered country from
<PB N="142" REF="140">
who&s;e bourn no traveller returns."</Q> But how do I now rejoice at not having pa&s;&s;ed the irremeable bounds in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility to the virtues of my now truly dear, and I hope happy wife! &s;he is an angel, Seymour!</P>
<P>I KNOW what true delight the&s;e words will give you; they are &s;incere, my friend&mdash;they flow from my full heart. Blinded as I have been to her perfections, you will &s;urely pardon the tran|&s;ports of a man, who waking from a dream of mi&s;ery, finds him&s;elf in Ely&s;ium&mdash;&s;uch is my pre&s;ent &s;tate; what was my former one, you, and you only, know too well.</P>
<P>YOU are, doubtle&s;s impatient to hear what has brought this happy change; with plea&s;ure will I dwell on every circum&s;tance, that mu&s;t endear my Emily to my heart, and render her &s;till more amiable to my friend's eyes.</P>
<P>IT is now above two months &s;ince I received your fir&s;t account of Ransford's duel, and the marchione&s;s's di&s;tre&s;s. No words can paint the &s;trong emotions of my mind&mdash;a thou&s;and vari|ous &s;chemes to &s;uccour her, ru&s;hed in&s;tantly through my di&s;turbed imagination. My wife was pre&s;ent while I read your letter, and &s;aw the agitation of my mind. Her delicacy promp|ted her to retire; I prevented her, and told her, I know not how of Barnard's death, and begged her to inform lady Harriet of it in the tendere&s;t manner&mdash;needle&s;s caution.</P>
<P>I THEN told her I would go and acquaint Sir Harry Ransford with the affair; and ordered my hor&s;es to be got ready immediately.</P>
<P>I SET out directly on that purpo&s;e&mdash;but be|fore I had rode a quarter of a mile, a &s;udden im|pul&s;e &s;eized me, a certain foreign and irre&s;i&s;tible force, that impelled me to fly to the in&s;tant relief of the marchione&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="141">THE ba&s;ene&s;s and madne&s;s of &s;uch a re&s;olve, &s;prang forward to my view at the &s;ame moment, but the pa&s;&s;ions triumphed as they always mu&s;t do, at the fir&s;t on&s;et over the feebler rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I CONSIDERED, that Ransford might proba|bly call me to account for interfering in his af|fairs; and felt a gloomy &s;atisfaction in thinking that the lo&s;s of life might be deemed an atone|ment for the cruelty of my conduct towards Emily.</P>
<P>I THEN traver&s;ed the road in order to return home through my park, and got into my clo&s;et unperceived by my family.</P>
<P>I THERE took out the marchione&s;s's picture and hung it round my neck, as a kind of tali&s;|man, again&s;t that remor&s;e which I mu&s;t certainly feel, for abandoning my wife. I then &s;at down and wrote a letter to my Emily; and though at that time under the influence of the &s;tronge&s;t delirium, I am plea&s;ed and proud to own, that my tears flowed fa&s;ter than my ink, while I re|flected on the pain which &s;he mu&s;t &s;uffer when &s;heread tho&s;e lines.&mdash;I re&s;olved to travel night and day, and not put my letter in the po&s;t-office till I came to Canterbury.</P>
<P>AS I was &s;tepping out of my library, which you know looks into the parterre, I &s;aw my little boy at play, clo&s;e by the window with his maid.&mdash;The &s;ight of my &s;on, &s;tartled me.&mdash;The order of nature &s;eemed rever&s;ed&mdash;The child admoni&s;hing the parent. I felt all this, but felt my&s;elf at the &s;ame time like one in a dream labouring under an impre&s;&s;ion of the imagination, without rea&s;on to correct, or free-will to controul it. I could not pa&s;s into the park without being &s;een by them;&mdash;the private manner of my return would have alarmed the family. I was a&s;hamed to be detected by my
<PB N="144" REF="142">
&s;ervant, and &s;pent above an hour, which appear|ed a &s;ummer's day to me, in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s impatience. I have &s;ince thought, that this little accident &s;eemed as if kindly de&s;igned by Providence to give me time for reflection. But alas! the delay quickened the vehemence of my purpo&s;e to pur&s;ue my &s;cheme.</P>
<P>THE moment I was at liberty, I flew back to the park, bid my &s;ervants follow me, and &s;et off with all the &s;peed my hor&s;e could make.&mdash;But I had not got three miles from my deme&s;ne, when by &s;ome <HI>fortunate</HI> accident my hor&s;e made a fal&s;e &s;tep, which he was incapable of recovering, and threw me &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground.</P>
<P>HOW long I continued there, or what pa&s;&s;ed, during an interval of one and twenty days, has left no trace upon my memory; at the end of that period I awaked, as from unquiet re&s;t.&mdash;Gracious heaven! how &s;hall I ever be able to expre&s;s my a&s;toni&s;hment at beholding lady Woodville &s;eated by my bed-&s;ide, the &s;tatue of de&s;pair; pale, wan, and faded was her youthful cheek, her eyes were rai&s;ed to heaven, as if in &s;ervent though in hopele&s;s prayer! O, Seymour! what a train of horrid images broke in at once upon my burning brain; my un&s;ettled rea&s;on fluttered on the wing, and &s;eemed as if it would depart again for ever.</P>
<P>THE &s;triking object that appeared before me, impre&s;&s;ed my &s;en&s;es with a kind of awe; yet I had power to &s;peak to her! &s;he could not an|&s;wer&mdash;A flood of tears, but they were tears of joy, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the power of &s;peech. She was carried out of the room by doctor Fenton's or|ders, and I then feigned a &s;lumber, in hopes that recollection would afford &s;ome clue to lead me through the labyrinth of my &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="143">THE fir&s;t circum&s;tance that pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my memory, was, my having quitted Woodfort with a de&s;ign of abandoning that amiable crea|ture, whom I now beheld reduced to the &s;tate I have already de&s;cribed, by her tenderne&s;s for me;&mdash;the next thing that occurred to me, was my having had the marchione&s;s's picture round my neck, which I now &s;earched for in vain.&mdash;I in&s;tantly ordered every per&s;on to leave the room except Williams, and demanded from him an account of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and what was become of the picture which I had placed next my heart? I could have no doubt of his faith or &s;incerity&mdash;he has lived with me ever &s;ince I was a <HI>child,</HI> and loved me as if I had been <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>HE fell upon his knees by my bed-&s;ide, and begged me not to hurry or exhau&s;t my &s;pirits, which he was &s;ure mu&s;t be extremely weak, as this was the fir&s;t moment the fever had left me, for one and twenty days; during which time he told me lady Woodville had never quitted my apartment for a &s;ingle hour, nor clo&s;ed her lovely eyes.</P>
<P>THAT on the night I was brought home, the &s;urgeon had me &s;tripped, in order to know if I had received any wound or brui&s;e in my body; that he had taken off the picture, and given it to my wife, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be hers; and at that time &s;he took no notice of it; but that he had often &s;ince &s;een her gaze upon it mo&s;t intently, and &s;igh as if her heart would break.</P>
<P>HE &s;aid that Thomas had al&s;o brought her the papers which were found in my pockets; and &s;he gave them all to him, to lock up; but that Mrs. Winter, her woman, who was pre&s;ent, told her lady&s;hip there was a letter &s;ealed and di|rected for her, which &s;he took, and left the room.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="144">THAT &s;he returned in a few minutes as pale as death, but never di&s;clo&s;ed the contents; though Mrs. Winter took as much pains as &s;he dared to find them out, as &s;he could not conceive what I could have to &s;ay to lady Woodville, when I had but ju&s;t left her.</P>
<P>HE told me, Seymour, that Emily has knelt by my bed-&s;ide for hours in &s;peechle&s;s agony; has ki&s;&s;ed my feveri&s;h lips, and bathed my bur|ning hands with her mo&s;t precious tears; and yet &s;he knew I had inhumanly determined to for&s;ake her! to leave &s;uch worth as hers a prey to pining grief and di&s;content! For whom?&mdash;You have too ju&s;tly named her the mo&s;t unwor|thy of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>YOU may &s;uppo&s;e that during Williams's reci|tal, my rea&s;on tottered in its feeble &s;eat; but I had &s;till enough left to rou&s;e my &s;lumbering vir|tue, and to re&s;olve that if I &s;hould recover, my future life &s;hould be devoted to love, to grati|tude, to Emily. This bear me witne&s;s, heaven! I had determined before I knew, or even thought it po&s;&s;ible I ever &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e the marchio|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as I heard all that Williams had to &s;ay, I begged to &s;ee my wife. Doctor Fenton ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed my reque&s;t. I acquie&s;ced upon his telling me &s;he had lain down to re&s;t.</P>
<P>THE next day I repeated my entreaties with|out &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;On the third I became &s;o impati|ent, that Williams thought it mo&s;t prudent to let me know the &s;ad truth, which was, that lady Woodville lay dangerou&s;ly ill of the fever &s;he had caught from me.</P>
<P>I WAS no longer &s;en&s;ible of my own weak &s;tate.&mdash;The tumult of my pa&s;&s;ions gave me a momentary &s;trength.&mdash;I ru&s;hed out of bed
<PB N="147" REF="145">
upon the <HI>in&s;tant</HI>; never, Seymour, did I experi|ence &s;uch <HI>another!</HI> All lady Woodville's merits, which I had before but coldly admired, appeared to me now in the warme&s;t colours, and ro&s;e even to perfection. But when contra&s;ted with my ingratitude towards her, they overcame me.&mdash;I &s;unk, into my &s;ervant's arms, and &s;hed a flood of tears.</P>
<P>IN &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition I would be carried into my wife's apartment.&mdash;I had re&s;olved to implore her pity, and forgivene&s;s of my pa&s;t fol|lies, and to a&s;&s;ure her of my future conduct, which I could no longer entertain a doubt of; as the &s;incere and tender affection I then felt for her, would, I hoped, en&s;ure her happine&s;s, and that I &s;hould date mine from her recovery.</P>
<P>THINK of my &s;ituation, Seymour, when I approached her bed&s;ide&mdash;&s;he was delirious! yet the dear angel knew me though &s;he raved, and in &s;uch terms, that her words &s;truck daggers to my heart&mdash;My &s;trength for&s;ook me; I fainted, and was carried back to my own chamber, the unhappie&s;t wretch that breathed upon the earth.</P>
<P>IN pity to you, I will draw a veil over the wild ravings of my tortured mind, and make you happy by telling you that I am truly &s;o, by knowing that my deare&s;t Emily is out of dan|ger.</P>
<P>THIS letter has been the work of two days; to-morrow I am to &s;ee my wife.&mdash;I count the moments, Seymour, and think them hours till then!</P>
<P>I HAVE heard that per&s;ons who have been once mad, never recover the perfect u&s;e of their rea&s;on; or at lea&s;t are liable to &s;ome returns of in&s;anity. This thought &s;hocks me! for if I could &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould ever again &s;ink into that &s;hameful, that now dete&s;ted delirium, which
<PB N="148" REF="146">
&s;o long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me, I would not wi&s;h to live another hour&mdash;but it it impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;My Emily's virtues have &s;ubdued my heart, and time in&s;tead off le&s;&s;ening, mu&s;t increa&s;e their power.</P>
<P>IT is high time that I &s;hould condole with you, on the &s;ufferings you have endured from your generous friend&s;hip towards the marchione&s;s. The meanne&s;s of her behaviour to you, makes me rejoice in the hope of her not being Ransford's wife.&mdash;Yet contemptible as her conduct has made her appear even in my once partial eyes, &s;he mu&s;t not know di&s;tre&s;s, I mean with regard to her circum&s;tances: and while Sir Harry Rans|ford lives, it will not be in his &s;on's power to &s;upport her in the rank which &s;he has held for &s;ome years pa&s;t.&mdash;Let me therefore intreat you to inform me of the event of her law-&s;uit with the marquis of St. Aumont.</P>
<P>BE not alarmed at this reque&s;t, Seymour. It is not pa&s;&s;ion, but compa&s;&s;ion, that makes me wi&s;h to &s;erve her; for I here &s;olemnly declare, that if I were not certain of having intirely con|quered the phren&s;y, which had &s;o long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my enfeebled rea&s;on, I have &s;till virtue enough left to re&s;train my&s;elf from ever mentioning her name. But the real lu&s;tre of my Emily's virtues, have triumphed over the fal&s;e glare of I&s;abella's charms, that fatal <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> which &s;o long dazzled and mi&s;led my benighted &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>I SINCERELY rejoice in your fair ve&s;tal's re|covery;&mdash;may &s;he live to make you happy, as your uncommon &s;ituation will admit!</P>
<P>I AM truly concerned for Ransford, and ear|ne&s;tly wi&s;h to know what cour&s;e he has pur&s;ued.&mdash;I think with you, that he is now in Switzer|land; and &s;uppo&s;e he has written to you before this time. What is become of lady Ransford?
<PB N="149" REF="147">
But I forget that you were prevented from &s;eeing her, before you left Paris.</P>
<P>ADIEU, my friend;&mdash;let me once more con|gratulate you upon my Emily's recovery, and my own re&s;toration, to more than life!</P>

<P>THE wi&s;hed for, the charming interview is over! but where, Seymour, &s;hall I find words to expre&s;s the delicacy of my Emily's con|duct? when I would have fallen at her feet, and implored her to forgive my having made her mi|&s;erable, &s;he caught me in her arms, with that mode&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, which accompanies her every action, and &s;aid that all the mi&s;ery &s;he had ever &s;uffered, aro&s;e from con&s;idering her&s;elf as the fatal, though innocent cau&s;e of my unhappi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THAT &s;he &s;hould ever be truly grateful for the pains I had taken to prevent her being wretch|ed, by endeavouring to conceal a pa&s;&s;ion which &s;he was &s;ure it was as impo&s;&s;ible for me to conquer, as it had been to di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT &s;he had long known of my attachment to the marchione&s;s, and that her utmo&s;t wi&s;h for many months pa&s;t, was to be con&s;idered as my fir&s;t friend; that &s;he &s;hould never make an im|proper u&s;e of my confidence, but that her utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s &s;hould be exerted to &s;ooth the &s;orrows,
<PB N="150" REF="148">
which &s;he could not heal.&mdash;A flood of tears oppo&s;ed her farther utterance.</P>
<P>I TOOK that opportunity of a&s;&s;uring her, that it was in her power, and hers alone to render me the happie&s;t of men.</P>
<P>SHE wiped away her tears, and gazed on me, with looks of joy and doubt. Let not your kind|ne&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, tempt you to deceive me. I feel too well, the impo&s;&s;ibility of conquering a fond, a real pa&s;&s;ion! but I will &s;trive, my lord.</P>
<P>I CAUGHT her trembling hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it to my lips. O no! I cried, my Emily! my love! indulge your virtuous fondne&s;s, and deeply as my heart appears to be indebted to you, like a poor bankrupt, it &s;hall give its all though it can never pay you what it owes&mdash;She quickly exclaimed, O I am overpaid in this ble&s;&s;ed mo|ment, for years of mi&s;ery! your heart! but can you give it? is it yours, my lord?&mdash;No, Emily! unworthy as it is, it is already yours, and &s;hall be ever &s;o.</P>
<P>TEARS and embraces clo&s;ed this charming &s;cene; and now with truth, my Seymour, can I boa&s;t I never knew what heart-felt rapture was before that hour.</P>
<P>THE conferring happine&s;s, on any creature, is certainly the highe&s;t enjoyment, of any human mind; but the paying it to an amiable, and de|&s;erving object, mu&s;t heighten the &s;entiment, even to tran&s;port.</P>
<P>SIR James Thornton has been obliged to re|turn to England, on account of a law-&s;uit. He purpo&s;ed keeping him&s;elf concealed, but upon hearing of mine, or rather my Emily's illne&s;s, he po&s;ted down from London, to Sir William Law&s;on's, and remained there till &s;he was pro|nounced out of danger. Since that time he had frequent accounts of our recovery, from Fanny
<PB N="151" REF="149">
We&s;ton, with whom he corre&s;ponds in a very gal|lant &s;tile.</P>
<P>I KNOW <HI>&s;he</HI> likes the young baronet, and as I flatter my&s;elf he is cured of his hopele&s;s pa&s;|&s;ion for lady Woodville, or at lea&s;t, am well a&s;&s;ured that he will never pre&s;ume to pur&s;ue it, I have prevailed upon my wife to con&s;ent to his making us a vi&s;it; but neither his being at Woodfort, or any thing el&s;e, &s;hall prevent our going to Bri&s;tol in a few days; for though my lovely invalid is &s;urprizingly recovered from her late illne&s;s, the &s;hock which her con&s;titution has received, has rendered it almo&s;t as delicate, as her charming mind. I will watch over them both, and hope to re&s;tore them to their natural &s;tate, which is almo&s;t perfection.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;hewn Emily all your letters, and told her the &s;tory of my connection with the marchione&s;s, without concealing a &s;ingle circum|&s;tance which pa&s;&s;ed, either at Paris or York. During my narrative, <Q REND="inline">"I often did beguile her of her tears,"</Q> they flowed &s;incerely, when I informed her of the &s;truggles, of my then tor|tured mind.</P>
<P>I WELL knew that the confe&s;&s;ion of my pa&s;t weakne&s;s, mu&s;t give her pain; but I was certain &s;he would receive it as the &s;tronge&s;t mark of my pre&s;ent &s;incerity. The tenderne&s;s and delicacy of her expre&s;&s;ions, upon this trying &s;ubject, have, if po&s;&s;ible, rai&s;ed her in my e&s;teem, by convincing me that her under&s;tanding is as excel|lent, as her heart; and that her mind and per&s;on con&s;titute a trea&s;ure almo&s;t too great for the mo&s;t worthy man. Sen&s;ible as I am of my own de|merits, can I ever be &s;ufficiently grateful for &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing? but I will endeavour to de&s;erve it, Seymour, by devoting every hour of my future life to her happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="150">SINCE the recovery of my rea&s;on, I have re|ceived infinite plea&s;ure from playing with my little boy. How could I be in&s;en&s;ible to the natural and innocent endearments of &s;uch a lovely creature? but I find happine&s;s and plea&s;ure crouding in upon me, through a thou&s;and ave|nues, that my delirium had rendered impervious to their &s;oft attacks; and I begin to think that I have been <HI>new-formed,</HI> as well as <HI>reformed,</HI> &s;ince my redemption.</P>
<P>LADY Woodville, who is &s;incerely grateful for your kind attachment to her, entreats you will at your return to Paris, endeavour to find out Sir James Miller, and purcha&s;e for him either a commi&s;&s;ion, employment, or annuity, which may be &s;ufficient for his &s;upport, as the unhappy man has ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to accept lady Mount Willis's bounty, from the moment he di&s;covered that it was to her he owed it. There is &s;omething like greatne&s;s of mind in this circum&s;tance, which renders him an intere&s;ting object. What mixtures are we compounded of!

<P>THIS letter will probably reach England but a few days before the writer of it; but I

would not for a moment delay pouring forth my acknowledgments, for the &s;incere plea&s;ure I have received from your two la&s;t letters; and my warme&s;t congratulations on the charming &s;ubject of them.</P>
<P>YES, thank heaven, my friend is re&s;tored to life, to rea&s;on and to happine&s;s! can Seymour &s;igh while he repeats that &s;ound! O Woodville! my cup has been &s;everely da&s;hed with &s;orrow, nor has there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> yet one joy unmixed e'er reached my heart. Yet let me not complain; my own imprudence formed the fatal web, that has en&s;nared my peace; the unhappy duel that I fought with captain Beaumont &s;ealed its ruin!</P>
<P>BUT why &s;hould I di&s;tre&s;s you by tracing my misfortunes to their &s;ource; it is too much for you to know, that I am wretched&mdash;no matter for what cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE length of time that has elap&s;ed &s;ince my la&s;t letter to you, has been fertile of &s;ad events; which I &s;hall relate to you in as &s;uccinct a man|ner as I can.</P>
<P>WHEN I had been about a week at Belleveue the good old general was attacked with a di&s;order in his &s;tomach, which had mo&s;t alarming &s;ymp|toms. He was &s;en&s;ible of his &s;ituation, but &s;eemed to wi&s;h to conceal it from his children, who vied with each other in their tender|ne&s;s and affliction for him. It is impo&s;&s;ible to do ju&s;tice to their merits, or de&s;cribe the affecting &s;cene.</P>
<P>AT the end of twelve days he expiried, and left the mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate family I ever beheld: but Charlotte's grief &s;urpa&s;&s;ed even credibility. Neither her brother, &s;i&s;ter, nor I, could prevail upon her to leave the chamber where the body lay, till the moment it was to be i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">erred.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear WOODVILLE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was impo&s;&s;ible for me to have added another word to my la&s;t letter. I have but a very few more to &s;ay with regard to the Beaumont family, and then the dear, the fatal
<PB N="155" REF="153">
name &s;hall no more pa&s;s my lips, but remain trea&s;ured up in my &s;ad heart, a precious hoard for everla&s;ting grief to brood upon.</P>
<P>I TOLD you in &s;ome of my former letters, that captain Beaumont vi&s;ited me every day, du|ring my confinement in the Chatelet. He there beheld and became enamoured of the fair Maria D'Angueville. When he had been about ten days at Belleveue, he acquainted me with his pa&s;&s;ion, and intreated me to &s;peak to his father upon the &s;ubject. Accident prevented my having an opportunity of obeying him, till the general's illne&s;s rendered it improper&mdash;and the real afflic|tion which he has &s;ince felt, &s;eemed to have quenched the new enkindled flame.</P>
<P>BUT a few days after our return to Paris, he again re-a&s;&s;umed the &s;ubject, and begged me to apply to his fair cou&s;in and his uncle, for leave to pay his addre&s;&s;es, to her. I told him truly that the &s;ituation of my mind rendered me total|ly unfit to be the amba&s;&s;ador of love or joy; but that I was determined before I &s;hould leave the Chatelet, to return thanks for the humane and generous treatment I had met with from the go|vernor and his fam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and to intreat Maria's acceptance of the legacy which her uncle the general had bequeathed me of twenty thou&s;and livres.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT that captain Beaumont appeared di&s;plea&s;ed at my intention; as he coolly replied, that he did not want a fortune with his wife, and thought I had better be&s;tow the legacy I did not chu&s;e to accept, upon &s;ome of the younger chil|dren of the family, who might po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand in need of my bounty. I told him that Maria's likene&s;s to his beloved &s;i&s;ter, had made her the principal object of my pre&s;ent attention, and
<PB N="156" REF="154">
that I would put it in her power to di&s;po&s;e of the &s;um in que&s;tion, as &s;he thought proper.</P>
<P>SOON after this conver&s;ation the captain with|drew, and remained for &s;everal days &s;o en|tirely ab&s;orbed in grief, that I reflected not upon the unkindne&s;s of my friend's conduct, who neither came nor &s;ent to me for near a fortnight.</P>
<P>AT length he entered my chamber one morn|ing without being announced, and found me ga|zing &s;o intently upon Charlotte's picture, that I &s;aw him not till he exclaimed with a voice of di&s;traction, What unmerited affliction and di&s;tre&s;s has the unhappy Seymour brought on all the Beaumont race?</P>
<P>THOUGH the &s;everity of this reproach might have rouzed my re&s;entment at another time, I was &s;o much &s;oftened by the object then before me, my angel Charlotte's face! that bur&s;ting into tears, I an&s;wered&mdash;O Beaumont! cannot grief like this atone for my involuntary crimes? and does my friend upbraid my mi&s;ery?</P>
<P>AT the&s;e words he ru&s;hed into my arms, and cried, forgive me, Seymour. Then &s;tarted wildly from me and went on&mdash;but wherefore flow the&s;e tears upon a &s;en&s;ele&s;s object, lo&s;t and forgotten in the grave, when there is now a fair|er and kinder maid ready to heal your &s;orrows?</P>
<P>I COULD not avoid expre&s;&s;ing my a&s;toni&s;h|ment at this unintelligible di&s;cour&s;e, and it was a long time before he explained him&s;elf, by telling me that the lovely and innocent D'angueville had conceived a pa&s;&s;ion for me during the time I remained a pri&s;oner in the Chatelet; and that upon being pre&s;&s;ed by her father and mother to receive her cou&s;in's hand, &s;he had declared that &s;he would rather pa&s;s her days in a cloi&s;ter than with any other man but lord Seymour. I was extremely affected with this intelligence, as it
<PB N="157" REF="155">
concerned my friend, the unhappy girl, and my own honour.</P>
<P>I ASSURED captain Beaumont, that I never had &s;poken to her upon the &s;ubject of love, or made the lea&s;t attempt to gain her affections; and that I was ready to do every thing in my power to a&s;&s;i&s;t in conquering Maria's weak par|tiality to me, that might not injure her delicacy or my own character.</P>
<P>THE frankne&s;s and &s;incerity of my manner, &s;oon got the better of his ill-grounded &s;u&s;picions; he a&s;ked my pardon a thou&s;and times, for having entertained a doubt of my affection to his dear dead &s;i&s;ter; but hoped, as I had been my&s;elf a lover, I would forgive his ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT was at la&s;t agreed upon between us, that I &s;hould write to Maria directly, and acquaint her with the real &s;tate of my heart, which mu&s;t be for ever incapable of love for any earthly object; that I &s;hould not &s;ee her before I left Paris; and at my &s;etting out, &s;hould take an everla&s;ting leave of her by letter. That neither her father, nor any other per&s;on &s;hould pre&s;s her to marry, till time and rea&s;on might enable her to triumph over a pa&s;&s;ion which oppo&s;ition would certainly increa&s;e. That captain Beaumont would conti|nue his a&s;&s;iduities, without mentioning his love.&mdash;That &s;he &s;hould not know of the pre&s;ent I de|&s;igned her, till a year was elap&s;ed; but if at that time, &s;he refu&s;ed to marry captain Beaumont, I &s;hould be at liberty to put her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the twenty thou&s;and livres, and that &s;he &s;hould be allowed to di&s;po&s;e of them as &s;he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>THIS affair thus &s;ettled, my friend took his leave with a thou&s;and acknowledgments for what he called a &s;acrifice, and I &s;at down to fulfil my promi&s;e of writing to Maria&mdash;when Wil&s;on an|nounced
<PB N="158" REF="156">
a very unexpected vi&s;itor; it was ma|dame de St. Far, the marchione&s;s's mother, whom I had never &s;een or heard of &s;ince the time that you fir&s;t became acquainted with her daughter.</P>
<P>SHE was then, you may recollect, an agree|able figure, rather comely than hand&s;ome, and plumper than the generality of her country wo|men. She is now emaciated to a &s;keleton, and I could not help feeling &s;ome apprehen&s;ions, that &s;he would expire before &s;he left my apartment, as &s;he was frequently much agitated during the time &s;he &s;taid.</P>
<P>SHE told me, that her daughter had &s;uffered her to want even the common nece&s;&s;aries of life, and had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to &s;ee her from the mo|ment &s;he became a widow. Though I dete&s;t the marchione&s;s, I could not avoid ob&s;erving to ma|dame de St. Far, that I imagined the fir&s;t part of her accu&s;ation, mu&s;t be unju&s;t, as &s;he had for|merly appeared in the world, as a woman of fortune; and therefore mu&s;t certainly be able to &s;upport her&s;elf independent of her daughter's bounty.</P>
<P>SHE told me I was much deceived, and as &s;he had no longer any terms to keep with the un|grateful marchione&s;s, &s;he would reveal her real &s;ituation.&mdash;She then informed me, that &s;he had lived for &s;everal years with a mon&s;ieur de Ver|ville at Dijon, by whom &s;he had I&s;abella; that at length by the per&s;ua&s;ion of his friends, mon|&s;ieur de Verville determined to marry, and parted with her and her daughter; but allowed them a decent &s;upport, and took every proper care of his child's education.</P>
<P>THAT as &s;he grew up extremely hand&s;ome, madame de St. Far determined to bring her to Paris, in hopes of making her fortune; and for
<PB N="159" REF="157">
that purpo&s;e a&s;&s;umed the name &s;he now u&s;ed' and endeavoured to appear like a per&s;on of di&s;|tinction. That the marchione&s;s was perfectly acquainted with their circum&s;tances, and readily entered into the &s;cheme; but in order to carry it on, &s;he was obliged to run con&s;iderably in debt, though they were not above &s;ix months in Paris, before the marchione&s;s had the good fortune to charm both you and the marquis de St. Aumont.</P>
<P>SHE added, that the only rea&s;on her daughter ever gave for preferring the marquis to you, was the probability of becoming her own mi&s;tre&s;s by his death, for that &s;he knew her own di&s;po&s;ition &s;o perfectly, that &s;he was certain &s;he could not confine her affections to any one per&s;on long.</P>
<P>O Woodville! what an happy e&s;cape have you had from this vile woman! but to make an end of this tedious tale. She told me, that mon&s;ieur de Verville died without a will, &s;oon after the marchione&s;s's marriage; and that &s;he was by that means deprived even of the &s;mall income which he had allowed her. She implored me to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in getting into &s;ome convent, where &s;he might pa&s;s the remainder of her days without hearing of her undutiful and unnatural daughter. I have de&s;ired her to fix upon a proper place for her retirement, and I will readily pay the &s;um ne|ce&s;&s;ary to her admi&s;&s;ion. I pre&s;ented her with my pur&s;e, and de&s;ired to hear from her as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THIS affair, and lady Woodville's commands to find out Sir James Miller will detain me a few days longer in Paris. How earne&s;tly do I long to quit it! yet are not all places alike to the unhappy? no, there is one a&s;ylum, and but one, for wretchedne&s;s like mine&mdash;the peace|ful grave!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY dear SEYMOUR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR remark, that neither happine&s;s nor plea&s;ure comes to us unmixed, is but too aptly verified in me; for the real and tender concern which your &s;ituation gives me, is a &s;trong alloy to that tranquil happine&s;s I &s;hould at pre&s;ent enjoy, if the friend of my heart were not wretched.&mdash;There is &s;omething &s;o uncom|monly di&s;tre&s;sful in your circum&s;tances, that to attempt to le&s;&s;en your affliction, would be an in|&s;ult to humanity;&mdash;for who that has a heart to feel another's lo&s;s, would wi&s;h to &s;top the grace|ful tears that flow
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"where rea&s;on, and where virtue o'er the tomb, are fellow mourners?"</Q></P>
<P>I AM &s;orry for captain Beaumont's di&s;appoint|ment in love, but I have infinitely more pity for
<PB N="161" REF="159">
the young and innocent Maria. You and I both know how difficult it is to &s;truggle with the fir&s;t fond impre&s;&s;ions of the heart; and women in ge|neral, from a principle of delicacy are much more inclined than men, to cheri&s;h their fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, even when hope is fled.</P>
<P>I HAVE a melancholy proof of this truth too near me&mdash;poor lady Harriet Hanbury! She &s;till laments the unworthy Barnard, and I fear will &s;oon follow him to an untimely grave,&mdash;while Sir James Thornton &s;eems to have transferred the pa&s;&s;ion he felt for lady Woodville to Mi&s;s We&s;ton, who kindly receives his vows, and will, I hope, &s;oon crown his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help being extremely &s;hocked at the infamous conduct of the marchione&s;s towards her mother.&mdash;Why need we become volunteers in vice? Our pa&s;&s;ions but too &s;trongly and fre|quently impel us to break the bounds pre&s;cribed by virtue; but then tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions may, I humbly hope, in &s;ome degree alleviate our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; but her unnatural behaviour to the unhappy wo|man who gave her birth, admits of no extenua|tion. This could not have proceeded from any pa&s;&s;ion, and mu&s;t therefore be a double vice.</P>
<P>I am, however, much better plea&s;ed to owe my cure to Emily's virtues than to I&s;abella's vices; as the knowledge of the former are a per|petual &s;ource of happine&s;s to me, while the di&s;|covery of the latter mu&s;t for ever reflect on my own weakne&s;s, in being &s;o gro&s;sly deceived.</P>
<P>MADAME de St. Far's e&s;tabli&s;hment in the convent, mu&s;t not be at your expence. My Emily! my lovely generous girl! in&s;i&s;ts on pay|ing her pen&s;ion. She mu&s;t not be refu&s;ed what|ever &s;he de&s;ires, by Woodville, or his friend.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="160">I MOST impatiently long for your return to England; I wi&s;h you would meet us at Bri&s;tol, where we purpo&s;e going in a few days: for though my Emily is &s;o much recovered, that neither her phy&s;ician nor her&s;elf think &s;he has occa&s;ion to drink the waters, I will not be &s;atis|fied, unle&s;s &s;he does; as I flatter my&s;elf they may a&s;&s;i&s;t in confirming that health, which her pre&s;ent happine&s;s &s;eems to have perfectly re|&s;tored.</P>

<P>YES, Woodville, I will take your coun&s;el, and ha&s;ten to lay hold on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the only good that is now left me, your generous friend&s;hip! I will meet you at the Hot-wells in a &s;hort time; but I will not live in the &s;ame hou&s;e with you, nor return from thence to Woodfort. I know the value of your regards too well, to &s;uffer it to be productive of mi&s;ery to you, or your de&s;ervedly happy wife.&mdash;No! Seymour's

&s;orrows &s;hall not ca&s;t a &s;hade on the bright &s;un|&s;hine of your future days! nor &s;ubject you to the unavailing pain of endeavouring to era&s;e the dark engrained tints of melancholy, which mu&s;t form the colour of my life to come. Yet I will fre|quently behold my friend, and with &s;incere de|light, contemplate his felicity.</P>
<P>I HAVE at la&s;t had a letter from Ransford. Sure there is a fa&s;cination in the marchione&s;s's charms! He raves and is di&s;tracted at her having di&s;owned him as a hu&s;band, which &s;he has for|mally done by her &s;olicitor, in order to recover the remainder of tho&s;e effects which were con|fi&s;cated on account of his duel with captain Bar|nard. She carried her point; they were re&s;tored to the marchione&s;s de St. Aumont, but her cre|ditors have &s;eized on every thing &s;he left. Her hu&s;band's nephew has carried his &s;uit again&s;t her, but has allowed her an annuity of four thou|&s;and livres, while &s;he remains unmarried, in re&s;pect to his uncle's memory.&mdash;I think this in|come is quite &s;ufficient for her wants, and in|finitely beyond her merits. I therefore intreat you to re&s;erve your genero&s;ity for &s;ome more worthy object.</P>
<P>THE now happy St. Far is &s;ettled in a convent at Dijon; where &s;he propo&s;es leading an exem|plary life. Lady Woodville's expence, for &s;he mu&s;t be obeyed, will not amount to more than forty pounds a year.</P>
<P>ABOUT ten days ago, a monk came to my apartments, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with me. He told me there was a lady in the Carmelites con|vent, who begged to &s;ee me upon an affair of the utmo&s;t importance to one of my friends. I en|quired very particularly who the lady was: he &s;aid he knew nothing more of her than that &s;he was an Engli&s;hwoman, and was called Jeffer&s;on.
<PB N="164" REF="162">
He added, that at her reque&s;t he had been often to &s;eek for me, while I was ab&s;ent from Paris; that he had given up all hopes of meeting me; but rejoiced at his being more fortunate than he expected, and intreated me to obey the lady's &s;ummons.</P>
<P>THIS affair would have been matter of &s;pe|culation to me, if my mind had been &s;ufficiently at ea&s;e, to think about it; but without reflecting at all upon the &s;ubject, I entered the Carmelite's convent at ten o'clock the next morning and en|quired for Mrs. Jeffer&s;on.&mdash;I did not wait long in the parlour, when a lady dre&s;&s;ed in deep mour|ning approached the grate. I fixed my eyes in|tently upon her, and knew her to be lady Rans|ford.&mdash;A crim&s;on glow over&s;pread her cheek when &s;he &s;aluted me, and at that moment &s;he appeared a mo&s;t intere&s;ting object.</P>
<P>TO &s;ave her the trouble of apologizing for &s;ending for me, I told her how much I had been di&s;appointed at not being able to di&s;cover her re|treat at my return to Paris, and I begged to know if I could be any way &s;erviceable to her; and, at the &s;ame time intreated &s;he would inform me, of every thing &s;he knew, in relation to the un|happy affair, between captain Barnard and my friend.</P>
<P>HER tears flowed fa&s;t and &s;ilent, while I &s;poke&mdash;When &s;he perceived that I waited for her re|ply, &s;he took out her pocket book, and pre&s;en|ting it to me, &s;aid, your lord&s;hip will there find two letters, which will render any conver&s;ation with me upon this painful &s;ubject, needle&s;s.&mdash;I commit them to your care, in order that every po&s;&s;ible u&s;e may be made of them, for Mr. Rans|ford's advantage. I bear no enmity to his father, nor do I wi&s;h to make him an exile from that country to which I never more will return.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="163">I ASKED her with as much delicacy as I po&s;|&s;ibly could, what &s;cene of life &s;he intended to pur&s;ue, and again repeated the offer of my &s;er|vice to her. She thanked me, and &s;aid that captain Barnard's death had made her think dif|ferently, from what &s;he had ever done before; that &s;he was too con&s;cious of the enormity of her conduct, to think of returning into the world; that &s;he therefore determined to pa&s;s her days in a convent, but would always have it in her pow|er to quit it, as &s;he did not mean to make any vows.</P>
<P>I REALLY admired the rationality of her &s;entiments, and of cour&s;e approved them; but was ignorant by what means &s;he could be &s;uppor|ted, even in a convent; till &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, that at her marriage to Sir Harry Ransford, he had &s;igned an article allowing her in ca&s;e of &s;epara|tion, a power of three thou&s;and pounds, or an annuity of a hundred and fifty pounds a year, during his life; and a jointure of four hundred pounds a year at his death. She &s;aid the annuity would be &s;ufficient for her maintenance; that &s;he de&s;ired no favour from a per&s;on &s;he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have injured, though the fatal con|nection, between Sir Harry and her, had been the &s;ource of all her mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>SHE begged me to forward Barnard's letter to Ransford, and to &s;end copies of it to the cap|tain's friends in England, in order to pave the way for Ransford's return. I promi&s;ed to obey her, and took my leave; as I now mu&s;t of you, in order to ha&s;ten my &s;etting out.&mdash;You will probably hear from me once more, before you &s;ee your unhappy, but</P>

<P>I HAVE at length taken an everla&s;ting leave of Paris, and have got &s;o far on my way to my native land, but without being &s;en&s;ible of that charming enthu&s;ia&s;m, which is &s;tiled the Amor Patriae, and which I believe has been oftner de|&s;cribed than felt by voluntary exiles, for I confe&s;s that I have very little idea of local attachments; per&s;ons, and not places, have engro&s;&s;ed all the affections of which my heart is capable; and though the &s;ight of Albion's chalky cliffs, may not in&s;pire me with much delight, I &s;hall cer|tainly feel true plea&s;ure, when I behold my dear Woodville and his amiable wife.</P>
<P>I SHOULD not &s;top on my journey to tell you this, becau&s;e I am &s;ure you mu&s;t know it untold, but my worthy, my faithful Wil&s;on, whom I have long con&s;idered as my friend, though he &s;till acts as my &s;ervant, left Paris with a &s;light fever on him: travelling has, perhaps, increa&s;ed his malady, and I purpo&s;e halting here till he is quite recovered.</P>
<P>I GAVE you an account of my interview with lady Ransford, in my la&s;t, and will now inform you, of the purport of tho&s;e letters, which were found in captain Barnard's pocket, after the duel. That which was addre&s;&s;ed to her lady&s;hip, was filled with tender adieus, and &s;oft contrition for having involved her in di&s;tre&s;s, and leaving her probably expo&s;ed to mi&s;ery in a foreign land; with the mo&s;t &s;olemn intreaties not to pro&s;ecute
<PB N="167" REF="165">
Mr. Ransford in ca&s;e he &s;hould &s;urvive, as he there acknowledged, that he had drawn the duel on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THAT which he wrote to Ransford was &s;hort, yet contained the fulle&s;t declaration, of his hav|ing fought the quarrel, and its con&s;equences, from a wearine&s;s of life, which he &s;aid mu&s;t be for ever embittered, by reflecting on the ba&s;ene&s;s of his behaviour towards lady Harriet Hanbury, as well as on the unworthy part he had acted, in &s;educing lady Ransford from her duty.

<P>HOW incon&s;i&s;tent is the conduct of this unfor|tunate man! his attention to the pre&s;ervation of his antagoni&s;t's life, is certainly noble; but what an act of inhumanity was it to lay Ransford un|der the fatal nece&s;&s;ity of becoming his executio|ner? or how are we to reconcile the &s;pirit of this la&s;t action, with the unworthy te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">or of his for|mer life?</P>
<P>I AM convinced there is no human creature &s;o intirely lo&s;t to virtue, as not to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one good quality at lea&s;t, which if known, and properly cultivated, might in &s;ome mea&s;ure coun|terbalance its owner's vices to &s;ociety; but we are all too apt to reprobate a faulty character; too indolent to &s;earch out the latent virtues of another's heart; and find it more for our ea&s;e, to take it for granted, that a vicious per&s;on mu&s;t be vicious throughout, than to &s;eek for a grain of wheat in a bu&s;hel of chaff.</P>
<P>AFTER many fruitle&s;s inquiries, I am informed that Sir James Miller has obtained a commi&s;&s;ion in the Hungarian &s;ervice, by &s;ome of his friends here, and that he left Paris about three weeks

<P>MY parting with the dear remains of the Beaumont family was truly affecting, madam de Carignon came to Paris, on purpo&s;e to bid me adieu. Captain Beaumont pre&s;ented me with his and his father's pictures; he had before given me Charlotte's portrait.&mdash;Alas! it was an u&s;ele&s;s gift, as her dear image is too &s;trongly graved on my &s;ad heart!</P>
<P>I WILL not dwell upon this &s;ubject longer; but it is impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould turn my thoughts to any other now.&mdash;I can therefore only &s;ay,</P>
