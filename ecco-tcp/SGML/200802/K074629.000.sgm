<L>TO thee, to whom the equal hand of Heaven,</L>
<L>Though it depriv'd thee of external &s;ight,</L>
<L>The better graces of the mind has given,</L>
<L>Genius, and Learning's thews, and Judgement's light,</L>
<L>And Fortitude, mid unde&s;erved ills,</L>
<L>And wide-embracing Liberality,</L>
<L>Each thought humane which the &s;weet bo&s;om fills,</L>

<L>While Truth approves, deny not of my lays,</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF the author &s;hould &s;ay, he did not heartily approve of compo&s;itions of this kind, or admire the con&s;truc|tion of the &s;tanza, or think the more highly of any per|&s;on for clothing his thoughts in the phra&s;eology of Spen&s;er; it might be a&s;ked, what induced him to write the following poem? and how he came to lay it before the public? As to the fir&s;t que&s;tion, it owes its birth to accident alone. As to the &s;econd, he frankly owns, that he flattered him&s;elf &s;ome merit would be found in it, independent of the uncouth manner and antiquated dre&s;s in which it was to appear: and this only he is &s;en&s;ible can ju&s;tify the publication of it to a reader of ta&s;te and di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>It may be proper perhaps ju&s;t to mention the prior part of the fable, of which this is to be &s;uppo&s;ed a con|&s;equence. In the 9th Canto of the 2d Book of the Fairy Queen, <HI>Guyon</HI> and <HI>Arthur</HI> journeying together, arrive at the ca&s;tle of <HI>Alma,</HI> which they find be&s;ieged by <HI>Malaeger</HI> and his crew, whom they engage, and put to the rout. They are courteou&s;ly received by <HI>Alma,</HI> who &s;hews them her ca&s;tle. In the chamber of <HI>Memory</HI> they find two books, one called, <HI>The Briton Moniments;</HI> the other, <HI>The Antiquity of Fairy Lond;</HI> an account of the&s;e

In the 11th, <HI>Guyon</HI> departs on his adventures again&s;t the <HI>Bower of Bli&s;s,</HI> upon which the enemies of <HI>Alma,</HI> being emboldened, return to the &s;iege. <HI>Arthur</HI> &s;allies out again&s;t them, and after a &s;e|vere engagement overcomes their chief, by &s;queezing him to death. His &s;quire brings him back to the ca&s;tle covered with wounds:</P>
<Q><L>Where many grooms and &s;quires ready were,</L>
<L>To take him from his &s;teed full tenderly;</L>
<L>And eke the faire&s;t Alma met him there</L>
<L>With balm, and wine, and co&s;tly &s;picerie,</L>
<L>To comfort him in his infirmitie:</L>
<L>Eft&s;oons &s;he caus'd him up to be convey'd,</L>
<L>And of his arms de&s;poiled ea&s;ily;</L>
<L>In &s;umptuous bed &s;he made him to be laid,</L>
