<P>YOU &s;ee the Up&s;hot of the <HI>Informa|tion</HI> again&s;t the BISHOPS; his Maje|&s;ty was in the Camp at <HI>Houn&s;low,</HI> the Soldiers huzza'd at the News, as loudly as the Mob at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall.</HI> Mob! did I &s;ay? It was a Multitude of Nobility, Gen|try and Citizens of the be&s;t Note. The King was terribly chagrin'd; he ask'd what Noi&s;e was that? They told him, No|thing, but the Soldiers rejoicing at the Acquittal of the Bi&s;hops. Do you call that Nothing, &s;ays he? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Chief Ju&s;tice.</NOTE><HI>Wright</HI> is an excellent Chief; the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King might find him a very u&s;eful Magi&s;trate in <HI>Lan|guedoc,</HI> at this Time. The Command of a Province in <HI>Turkey</HI> would admirably &s;uit his Genius. The Forms of the Law of
<PB N="2" REF="9">
<HI>England</HI> were a great Re&s;traint upon his Zeal; the Spirit of Tyranny in his Office, and Adulation towards his Prince (which generally go together) had &s;uch an A&s;cen|dant over him, that he broke thro' all De|cency; he could not conver&s;e with Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Powell</HI> upon the Points of Law, without mal-treating him: He has &s;uch an Aver&s;ion to poor Sir <HI>B. Shower,</HI> and had at the &s;ame Time &s;o little Command of his Temper, that he in&s;ulted him, tho' he was for the Pro&s;ecution. This arbitrary Behaviour of great Magi&s;trates in &s;ilencing Coun&s;el, who&s;e Faces they do not like, is of greater Con&s;equence to the Public than People generally &s;eem to apprehend: But a fitter Opportunity of treating the Man ill could hardly be cho&s;en; for the Generality of the Audience were prejudic'd again&s;t him, on Account of the Service he was engaged in, and were therefore pre|pared to approve of all the ill U&s;age that could be offer'd to him: On the other hand, the King had little Occa&s;ion for him, for the Sollicitor-General was a Minion, as &s;currilous as <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> as pro&s;titute and impudent as <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI> When this Tryal is printed, I hope the odious Co|lours that the principal Characters will ap|pear in, both at the Bar and on the Bench, will have a good Effect on the Gentlemen
<PB N="3" REF="10">
of the Profe&s;&s;ion for the growing Genera|tion, as young <HI>Spartans</HI> were taught to hate Drunkenne&s;s by &s;eeing the odious Ef|fects of it upon their Slaves. If Judges and State&s;men would only examine them|&s;elves by the Faults of tho&s;e who &s;tand con|demned in Hi&s;tory, and ask Que&s;tions like the&s;e; Am I <HI>Hubert de Burgo?</HI> Am I <HI>Tre|&s;ilian?</HI> Am I <HI>Sejanus?</HI> Am I <HI>Villers?</HI> Am I guilty of the Crime for which this Man's Memory is ju&s;tly hated? I &s;ay, were Men thus to reflect, they would forget the Tip-Staves, the Trainbearer and Collar of <HI>SS.</HI> the Coronet and the Blue Ribbon: They would not bear being branded Villains to Po&s;terity; and if true Philanthropy and Patrioti&s;m could not enter into every Brea&s;t, there would at lea&s;t be an Appearance of them, Men would learn to be affable, be|nign, Lovers of Ju&s;tice, or to &s;eem &s;o; there would be that Re&s;emblance of the Virtues, that Mankind would be deceived and &s;ati&s;|fied. Don't tell me of a Man's Eminence in his Profe&s;&s;ion, or the high Po&s;t he fills in the State; his Learning and Knowledge of the World have not enlarged his Mind; he is &s;till a little poor Wretch, if he does not remember what a &s;mall Part he makes among the Current of Ages. He looks about him, and fancies the pre&s;ent Scene the only one of great Importance, that
<PB N="4" REF="11">
Time has produc'd; and, three to one, e&s;teems him&s;elf the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Character exhibited in it. Where was this Man bred? Is he ignorant what a Racket the School-Boys make with <HI>Alexander,</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and <HI>Sylla;</HI> with <HI>Cato</HI> and <HI>Brutus,</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;tides?</HI> But enough of this. I &s;up|po&s;e we &s;hall have the Tryal printed in a Month: In the mean while I &s;end you Part of what Mr. <HI>Somers</HI> &s;aid; he was Junior Coun&s;el for the Bi&s;hops; he was very brief, is much applauded for that little he did &s;ay, but I &s;uppo&s;e will not &s;udden|ly be made a Judge, nor King's Coun&s;el neither. The Heat of Mens Minds at the Trial was violent on all Sides. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Sollicitor-General.</NOTE><HI>Williams</HI> did not &s;cruple to &s;ay, that if the Bi|&s;hops were commanded to do any Thing again&s;t their Con&s;ciences, they &s;hould have acquie&s;ced till the Meeting of the Parlia|ment, they &s;hould not have petitioned. And this vile immode&s;t A&s;&s;ertion was re|ceived with &s;ufficient Indecency: People hi&s;s'd at him for that and for &s;omething el&s;e in his Speech, as you would at a very bad Play. Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Powell</HI>'s Zeal, on the other Side, was &s;o eager to &s;ettle the Point, that the Petition was no Libel, that he did not &s;tick to affirm to the Jury, that it could
<PB N="5" REF="12">
not be a Libel, unle&s;s it were fal&s;e: But this, I fear, is fal&s;e Doctrine in our Law, tho' 'tis to be wi&s;h'd it were true: I only men|tion it, to &s;hew you what a Ferment the World is in. Upon the Whole, 'tis thought by &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t loyal Peo|ple in the Kingdom, that we have but a di&s;mal Pro&s;pect before us. 'Tis evident, that if the Grand Monarch don't effectu|ally interpo&s;e and pinch the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> will &s;peedily invade the Kingdom. If he &s;hould &s;ucceed, what loyal Brea&s;t can bear to think the Con&s;e|quences? Will he come here, like a Hero in Romance, only to mind other Peoples Bu&s;ine&s;s, and then be gone again? I trem|ble to reflect what is to become of &s;acred Maje&s;ty, to recollect the &s;hocking Fates of impri&s;on'd <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Kings, our <HI>Edward, Richard,</HI> and the Royal Martyr, his Adage was verified in them all. On the other hand, what if the Prince &s;hould be pre|vented, or be defeated? What Prote&s;tant Soul is not &s;haken, in the mid&s;t of all its Loyalty, to think of the Wonders that may be wrought both in Religion and Liberty, by the Gentlemen at <HI>Houn&s;low.</HI> 'Tis true, the Majority of them are Prote&s;tants at pre&s;ent, and many of their Officers are Men of Quality and Fortune (I am &s;orry, for the King's &s;ake, I can only &s;ay Majority)
<PB N="6" REF="13">
but 'tis as true, that if there be not Papi&s;ts and Soliders of Fortune enough in <HI>England,</HI> there are in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> to &s;hift out the Prote&s;tants and Men of Worth; and then if the Cau&s;e of the Bi&s;hops or of <HI>Magdalen-College</HI> &s;hould be brought before them, they will do Bu&s;ine&s;s in a Stile yet more conci&s;e than <HI>Wright</HI> and <HI>Allybone,</HI> or <HI>Jefferies</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> can pre|tend to. But &s;hould their E&s;tabli&s;hment be in Con&s;equence of an Inva&s;ion and of a Victory obtain'd again&s;t the Invader, then may we expect to &s;ee a &s;tanding Army made Part of the Con&s;titution. Whenever that happens, Parliaments can't be long-liv'd. The Soldier will never &s;tarve while the Hou&s;holder has any Thing to eat. How happy &s;hould we be, if the King would con|tent him&s;elf with 100 or 1000 Ma&s;&s;es a-Day for the Good of his own Soul, and permit his good Subjects to go to the Devil, if they liked: But we are come to this mi&s;erable Option, <HI>The King or the People mu&s;t be ruin'd;</HI> and the Wonder is, <HI>The King him|&s;elf makes the</HI> Dilemma. I forgot to tell you, that Serjeant <HI>Pemberton</HI> in his Argument took Occa&s;ion to mention Popery, and boldly &s;aid, <HI>'twas the very wor&s;t of all Re|ligions.</HI></P>

<P>I Agree with you, that Kings might be|nefit by reading Hi&s;tory with Attention, as much as their Mini&s;ters and Judges, per|haps they might much more, as the Sphere they move in is higher. I wi&s;h ours had ob&s;erv'd in the Life of his Grandfather<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry</HI> IV. of <HI>France,</HI> Father of Queen <HI>Henrietta-Maria,</HI> Wi&s;e of King <HI>Charles</HI> I.</NOTE> <HI>Henry</HI> the Great, or <HI>Davila</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Holy League,</HI> that the wi&s;e&s;t Hugonot in <HI>France</HI> advis'd the King to turn Papi&s;t, or give up all Thoughts of the Crown: The Parallel is natural. The very Palace of <HI>Whitehall,</HI> his Father's Statue at <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s,</HI> ought to be effectual Memento's of the Rage of a jealous People, who fear at once for Religion and Property. If once our zealous <HI>London</HI> Herd break loo&s;e, not all the Magic in the <HI>Roman</HI> Mi&s;&s;al will be able to charm them, not all the Thun|der in the <HI>Vatican</HI> to frighten them: And 'tis believed, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> XI.</NOTE> <HI>that</HI> Jupiter <HI>would be a plea&s;ed Spectator of the Broil.</HI></P>
<P>The military Gentlemen are the only u&s;eful Folks on &s;uch Emergencies, and they will hardly be per&s;uaded to de&s;troy
<PB N="8" REF="15">
their own Religion. There mu&s;t be a Reform fir&s;t, and a Recruit from <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> Indeed if a King of <HI>England</HI> were only to de&s;ire to en&s;lave his Peo|ple, an Army would make the Game &s;ure: No Matter how, or on what Occa|&s;ion they came together, they naturally re|&s;olve to continue together; for that is their very Life and Exi&s;tence: Like Bodies in the animal World, they endeavour their own Pre&s;ervation, and that is by the De|&s;truction of the Rights of Mankind; Food as proper for them, as Gra&s;s for Oxen; having neither Liberty nor Property them|&s;elves, they readily concur to de&s;troy them in others; that is only levelling; but it ends better &s;till for them; for when they have en&s;laved the People, they are rewarded with the ea&s;ie&s;t Chains, the uppermo&s;t Rank among Slaves, and often find out their own Strength, and plea&s;e them&s;elves in chopping and changing their Ma&s;ters. I can't be particular on a &s;udden; but I believe <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> afford forty or fifty In&s;tances to this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But we have at pre&s;ent, Religion mixed with our Politics, and that puts us out of all Danger; for who doubts the Religion of an Army? Perhaps every one does not apprehend it; but &s;eriou&s;ly, Armies &s;ome|times have Religion. When <HI>Henry</HI> III. of
<PB N="9" REF="16">
<HI>France</HI> was murder'd in his Camp, his great Succe&s;&s;or lo&s;t two Thirds of the Army in a Month, by De&s;ertion, becau&s;e of his Dif|ference in Religion, tho' they all ador'd him for many Royal Virtues. Who denies Religion, &s;uch as it was, to our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Armies of Covenanters? There was indeed one Army of <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks in the la&s;t War in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who prefer'd their Loyalty to one of the Tenets of their Religion: The Pope's Nuncio excommunicated the Earl of <HI>Clanrickard</HI> and his Adherents for continuing &s;teady in their Allegiance to King <HI>Charles;</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Clanrickard,</HI> at the Head of his Army, excommunicated the Pope's Nuncio by Beat of Drum. But as to our own Army, let its Religion be what it will, I wi&s;h the King had Impre&s;|&s;ions &s;omewhat weaker than he has of Church-of<HI>-England</HI>-Loyalty. Some over|weening Doctors have per&s;uaded him, that we are all Saints, but when we are brought to a &s;evere Te&s;t, the mo&s;t of us will be found mere frail Sinners. I wi&s;h tho&s;e di|vine Gentlemen had mixed a moderate Proportion of human Prudence with their politic Theology, that Principles might not be &s;train'd till they break. His Con|fe&s;&s;ors &s;hould con&s;ider what an unkingly, an ungenerous Conclu&s;ion they inculcate. <HI>The Principles of the Church of</HI> England <HI>oblige</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="17">

<P>THE too near Neighbourhood of <HI>Holland</HI> has thrown our Admini&s;tra|tion into a violent Ague; the hot Fit and the cold quickly &s;ucceed each other. Pub|lick Ju&s;tice is in a fluctuating Condition, it depends on the Winds and Weather, like the Rate of In&s;urance of Ships on their Voyages. By the Proceedings of the High-Commi&s;&s;ion-Court, we know which Way the Wind blows; 'tis a mere Barometer, with this Difference from the common Experiment with <HI>Mercury,</HI> that the Credit and Power of that Court ri&s;e high with a We&s;terly Wind or a Storm; an Ea&s;terly Gale &s;inks them down to nothing.</P>
<P>An old Gentleman, a Friend of mine, determin'd to mount in Armour for his Maje&s;ty, when fir&s;t he heard of this Inva|&s;ion; he has an inveterate Enmity to the Whigs, for cutting down his Timber in the Days of Seque&s;tration: But indeed this
<PB N="11" REF="18">
la&s;t low, little Shuffling, between Grace and Oppre&s;&s;ion, has brought him to have a very mean Opinion of the Royal Candour and Integrity, as well as of the Wi&s;dom and Hone&s;ty of the Coun&s;ellors: And now my Friend is re&s;olved to wait the Event of Affairs in a whole Skin; an Alteration which I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect to have happen'd to many! and even to &s;ome of the military People. The In&s;tability of our Councils is a &s;ure Symptom of a langui&s;hing Cau&s;e: A Soul by Turns &s;o temerarious and pu&s;il|lanimous, as on every little Opportunity to fly out into Acts of Wrong, and on every little Check &s;hamefully to cry, <HI>Peccavi:</HI> Such a &s;oul is only fit to animate the wor&s;t of Tyrants. I think 'twas <HI>Caligula</HI> that would run and hide under the Bed when it thunder'd, but could pi&s;s on the Statues of the Gods when he thought the Danger was over; and it was he too, that wi&s;h'd the People of <HI>Rome</HI> had but one Neck, that he might de&s;troy them at a Stroke. Surely the Mini&s;ters de&s;ign to pervert Peo|ple from their Loyalty; they could never el&s;e give &s;uch manife&s;t Occa&s;ion for Defec|tion. A Verbo&s;e <HI>Frenchman</HI> told the Car|dinal <HI>de Richlieu,</HI> that God might re&s;t the Government of the whole World on the Cardinal's Wi&s;dom: If this Compliment were true, our Country might afford a to|lerable
<PB N="12" REF="19">
Contra&s;t; for we have got State&s;men equal to the Task, if the Almighty in his Wrath &s;hould re&s;olve to de&s;troy the World by the Pravity of human Councils. But he that brings Good out of Evil, is yet able to &s;ave us.</P>

<P>I Don't wonder you &s;hould &s;u&s;pect me to be almo&s;t a Whig, for 'tis mo&s;t certain, I can't per&s;uade my&s;elf to draw a Sword to de&s;troy my Religion and Liberty: And yet I wi&s;h a Temper could be found to &s;ave both Prince and People. It is true, that there are Dangers to be apprehended from the Invader, and that mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e let who will draw the Sword for us. I al&s;o agree with you, that there is no natural Connection between Popery and Slavery; that the De&s;ign of impo&s;ing both at once on this Nation is only accidental; that a Pro|te&s;tant Prince may forge Chains for his Peo|ple as well as a Popi&s;h one; that Prote&s;tant <HI>Danes</HI> are Slaves, and Popi&s;h <HI>Switzers</HI> Free|men: But thus &s;tands our particular Ca&s;e, Our Prince has avow'd a De&s;ign to govern without Law; the Invader di&s;claims that
<PB N="13" REF="20">
odious Project: We are certain of our Ruin on the one Hand, we have &s;ome rea&s;onable Hopes of e&s;caping on the other.</P>
<P>It would not be ea&s;y for the Invader im|mediately to become ab&s;olute: That would depend upon a Standing-Army. The Power he brings won't be &s;ufficient to effect his principal Enterprize without a large Con|currence of <HI>Engli&s;hmen;</HI> and the Officers will be generally People of Families who will hardly on a &s;udden concur with Fo|reigners to en&s;lave them&s;elves: And I think the Prince's Hands will be too full of Ene|mies both at home and abroad, to hazard the Lo&s;s of his new Friends as &s;oon as he has got them, and to provoke the &s;ame People who invited him in, to turn him out again. No Mini&s;ters that he can em|ploy will &s;uddenly give &s;uch Advice. Even Mini&s;ters don't love Standing-Armies; don't de&s;ire to &s;ee their Prince above Law, unle&s;s they have had time enough to commit Crimes that make them afraid of Law, and glad of the Refuge of an arbitrary Protection: they approve of, and advance an ab&s;olute Power to protect them, only in Proportion to their own Nece&s;&s;ities. A Man who has acquir'd a good Fortune, naturally wi&s;hes to &s;ecure his Property in it, and to tran&s;mit that Property &s;afe to his Po&s;terity: Nothing but the Terrors that attend on Guilt can
<PB N="14" REF="21">
alter that De&s;ire, and they indeed can alter it. If he knows that his injur'd Country has had Cau&s;e to demand Vengeance upon him, he verifies the Devil's Ob&s;ervation, <HI>All that a Man hath will he give for his Life.</HI></P>

His Pur&s;e was full, his Peo|ple rich, his Revenue &s;o large that it hardly requir'd an Addition to maintain a great Army: His Nobility and Gentry, his Clergy and Univer&s;ities, his Counties and Boroughs, profe&s;&s;ed their Loyalty in the mo&s;t affec|tonate Terms; and yet in le&s;s than four Years time to u&s;e them all &s;o ill, that Af|fection or Loyalty to him &s;hould hardly be found in the whole Nation!

<P><HI>H&mdash;,</HI> who is particularly plea&s;ed with this Turn of Affairs, &s;ays that <HI>Waller</HI> pro|phe&s;ied it in his Poem on the Marriage of the Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange,</HI> he points out the&s;e Lines for that Purpo&s;e.<Q><LG>

of laying a&s;ide the King, the Birth of the Young Gentleman would naturally have been the next Enquiry; and indeed if he had been left in the Kingdom, it could not ea&s;ily have been avoided. But I &s;uppo&s;e his Friends thought the Air of <HI>London</HI> bad for his Health; for if you look into the Bills of Mortality, you will find, that abundance of Children drop off under two Years of Age. Now &s;ince he is gone, if the late King's Abdication (I think that is the Word) be right, it will be al&s;o right to reject the Youth tho' his Birth &s;hould be ever &s;o Royal; for will not he have Education and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Words in the Vote of Abdication.</NOTE> <HI>Advice from Prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits, and other wicked Per&s;ons of the Church of Rome?</HI> Not that the Hi&s;tory of the Warming-Pan is wholly to be lo&s;t; Men of different Complexions are capable of different Rea&s;onings and different Faiths. One Man may renounce him for being the Son of King <HI>James,</HI> and another for not being &s;o.</P>
<P>This new Word Abdicate has occa&s;ioned a great Di&s;play of Learning on the Debate of the Vote. It &s;eems our own Law (which &s;ays, <HI>the King can do no Wrong</HI>) was too mode&s;t to &s;upply a Word proper

for the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, &s;o that the Civilians were &s;o kind as to lend us this Term of Art. I believe I &s;hall be able to &s;end you the whole Debate in a little Time; I &s;hall therefore for the pre&s;ent only obviate a Mi&s;take, which &s;ome Gentlemen have fal|len into; as if by the Word, Abdicate, the King's Flight were only intended. It would have been too &s;evere to deprive him of his Crown for flying, when it was not &s;afe for him to &s;tay: And I am well informed that it &s;tands in the Vote neither to mean his Flight, nor any expre&s;s Decla|ration of his; but it will be be&s;t under&s;tood by comparing Mr. <HI>Somers</HI>'s Explanation of it with the Vote it&s;elf. <Q REND="inline"><HI>A Man,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>may Abdicate a Thing when he does an Act which is incon&s;i&s;tent with the re|taining it, tho' there be not an expre&s;s Renunciation.</HI> Calvin<HI>'s Lexic: Juridic: (Generum Abdicat, qui &s;pon&s;am Repudiat) he that divorces his Wife, abdicates his Son-in-Law.</HI></Q> I tran&s;cribe the Vote for you, le&s;t you &s;hould not have it by you.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Re&s;olved, That King</HI> James <HI>the Second, having endeavoured to &s;ubvert the Con&s;ti|tution of the Kingdom, by breaking the Original Contract between King and People; and by the Advice of Je&s;uits and other wicked Per&s;ons having violated the fundamental Law, and withdrawn him|&s;elf</HI>

<P>The other Vote for filling the Throne (which &s;ets the Prince on it as well as the Prince&s;s, the executive Power to be in him) is &s;omething like <HI>Harry</HI> the Seventh's Acce&s;&s;ion, or rather &s;tronger and more ex|plicite; for his Preten&s;ions to an Heredi|tary Right were well known, but he thought it prudent to leave the Matter complicated.</P>
<P>There is nothing new in this whole Tran&s;action, nor more wonderful than what has happened heretofore in many other Kingdoms.

right, I am &s;ure they cannot be in the Wrong: Their Grievances and their Dangers were much more importunate than our own. I thought every Thing degenerated which was carried into that Country: It &s;eems I am mi&s;taken; or perhaps Oppre&s;&s;ion, which makes a wi&s;e Man Mad, can al&s;o make a Coward Valiant. I fear we are generally too partial to our own Home, and injuri|ou&s;ly &s;o with Regard to our Neighbours. A true-bred <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Squire believes his Countrymen to be more powerful, more valiant, more wealthy, more numerous, more polite, more learned, more wi&s;e, not ouly than any other Nation, but than all the Nations on the Face of the Earth put together: If we could look on other Countries with an impartial Eye, we might &s;ee, that they have Numbers of People, and Sources of Wealth, and that they can either think or fight as well as our&s;elves. The old Aldermen in all our Country-Boroughs have learned from <HI>Baker</HI>'s Chro|nicle the Succe&s;&s;es of our <HI>Edwards</HI> and our <HI>Henries</HI> again&s;t <HI>France:</HI> They al&s;o know enough of our Story to tell us that <HI>Scot|land</HI> was not with us in tho&s;e Days, and that <HI>Ireland</HI> was of no Benefit to us; but they forget, that the be&s;t Provinces of mo|dern <HI>France</HI> were then under Princes of their own, mortal Enemies to that Crown;

they do not perceive the inte&s;tine Di&s;orders which made Way for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Arms; Nor how ea&s;y it was for a Neighbouring Prince who had their Royal Blood in his Veins to make Parties among a People of his own Religion, and how impo&s;&s;ible that Piece of Policy has been rendered by the Reformation: Modern <HI>France</HI> has at lea&s;t twenty Millions of People, and the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire not half that Num|ber. The like Alteration has been pro|duced in <HI>Spain,</HI> long &s;ince our Black Prince made a Figure on that Part of the Conti|nent. That Country, of many Kingdoms, is become one, So that tho our ancient Kings in the Holy War may have been as great and powerful as any of their Neigh|bours; yet we have Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that not even the Acce&s;s of <HI>Scotland</HI> under the &s;ame Allegiance with us, nor the Growth of <HI>Ireland</HI> in People, in Civility, and in Wealth, have been able to make us keep Pace with the va&s;t Increa&s;e of Power in the Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> &s;ince the Times I mentioned.

force them by Hard&s;hips into a Spirit of Faction? <HI>Cromwell</HI> in one of his Parlia|ments rejected many Boroughs, and in|crea&s;ed the Number of Repre&s;entatives for Counties: I have been told the late Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>That this was an Amendment to be wi&s;hed for in better</HI> TIMES. <HI>Oliver</HI> brought the Repre&s;enta|tives of the Three Kingdoms to &s;it in one Parliament: Is not this al&s;o an Alteration to be wi&s;hed for at all Times? It is a Pro|po&s;ition which indeed ought to be an Axiom in our Politicks, that the&s;e King|doms can never make a great and happy Empire, whil&s;t the con&s;tituent Parts envy the Pro&s;perity of each other, whil&s;t the Stronger oppre&s;&s;es the Weaker, and the Weaker is tempted to wi&s;h for an Oppor|tunity to chu&s;e a milder Lord, or even to &s;et up for an Independency; which we mu&s;t never think a Thing impo&s;&s;ible, be|cau&s;e in the la&s;t Century our Great-Grand|fathers &s;aw Seven little Di&s;tricts break loo&s;e from the other Ten (the whole being but a &s;mall Part of a mighty Empire) and &s;et up for them&s;elves with &s;uch &s;wift Succe&s;s, as in the &s;ame Generation to beat their old Soveraign off the Ocean; and in the pre|&s;ent Century have not our Fathers &s;een the Revolt of <HI>Portugal</HI> from the &s;ame ex|tended Empire, tho <HI>Portugal</HI> is a Country,

neither &s;pacious, populous, nor warlike; not defended from <HI>Spain</HI> by the Dangers of boi&s;terous Seas, nor by the Difficulties of <HI>Alps</HI> or <HI>Appenines.</HI></P>
<P>The People of <HI>Ireland</HI> cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed ignorant of their own Story; and indeed it is hard to find out, what has made them Slaves? or to be con&s;idered as a con|quered People? e&s;pecially if it be true, that at lea&s;t Nine Tenths of the Land-E&s;tate in that Kingdom is at pre&s;ent in the conque|rors Hands; and that this pre&s;ent War will probably make the like Divi&s;ion of the other Tenth, and this by the Aid and Arms of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tants of <HI>Ireland.</HI> Do <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> become Slaves by Conquering? The&s;e are Re&s;trained Provincial-Politicks. Let us &s;hew that a limited Monarchy can increa&s;e and thrive as well as an ab&s;olute one. Let us only rival Foreigners; but let us not depre&s;s one Country, Province, or Member of our own Empire, in Hopes to rai&s;e another. I &s;uppo&s;e if the Common-Council of <HI>London</HI> could make Laws for all <HI>England,</HI> we &s;hould have all the Manu|factures of all the different Cities and Counties re&s;trained to the Freemen of <HI>Lon|don</HI> only, and only to be carried on within the Sound of <HI>Bow-bell: Norwich</HI> or <HI>Taun|ton</HI> might probably take as great a Liking to the Woollen Manufacture, and <HI>Birm|ingham</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="32">
to the Monopoly of Hard-Ware. What Pity it is that &s;uch hopeful Schemes are not carried into Execution! How rich would they render the Nation! How power|ful the Prince in Proportion to the other Kings of <HI>Europe!</HI> How &s;ecurely we &s;hould engro&s;s our Manufactures without any Danger of being under-&s;old by our Neigh|bours! Tho' we have no Occa&s;ion to ex|tend the Limits of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire, yet, we &s;hould pur&s;ue &s;uch Maxims as will make it flouri&s;h, for Nature has done her Part for us. Our Situation tells us that we have no Bu&s;ine&s;s on the Continent; that if <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould make a Pre&s;ent to us of a Dozen &s;trong Towns in <HI>Flanders,</HI> they would not be worth the Keeping, and we &s;hould only have Occa&s;ion to re|&s;olve into what Hands to put them. The common Experience of every Trader will tell us, that our Manufactures mu&s;t be made cheap, if we would &s;ell cheap; and that if our Neighbours can under-&s;ell us, we may leave off Trade. We ought always to remember that the Woollen Manufacture came from <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the Silk from <HI>France,</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and both by the Means of Oppre&s;&s;ion, no Matter whether Religious or Political (tho I think <HI>Grotius</HI> in&s;i&s;ts that the <HI>Netherlands</HI> fought for Liberty, not for Religion) it &s;hould
<PB N="26" REF="33">
therefore be our Care, that, in guarding again&s;t a Rival in Trade, we do not mi&s;take our Mark; and that when we &s;uppre&s;s the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> who&s;e whole Profits center with us, and add to our Power, we do not advance the <HI>French,</HI> and &s;trengthen the Hands of our mo&s;t dangerous, our Hereditary Enemy. It would indeed be a grateful Return for the Pre&s;ent which they have wi&s;ely made us within the&s;e la&s;t twen|ty Years of a large Numbers of their indu&s;tri|ous Artizans; but, I believe, the mo&s;t &s;cru|pulous <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ca&s;ui&s;t will be content to remain in their Debt on this Account.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent undertake to &s;hew the Probability that, letting <HI>Ireland</HI> into a full Trade and into an Union too, would inrich and aggrandize this Kingdom: I fear you would believe I had taken too many Paradoxes on my Hands at once; but if I find you can dige&s;t Part of the Doctrines already advanced, I &s;hall take another Op|portunity to &s;hew that the true Scheme of National Trade is, to di&s;per&s;e the Multi|tude of Working-Hands thro the cheape&s;t Provinces, and that then you will have <HI>Gold as Bra&s;s, and Silver as Stones in the Streets</HI> of your Metropolis. I would at|tempt to prove, that nothing but a flouri&s;h|ing Trade, &s;upported by wi&s;e Treaties, brought <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to that happy Condi|tion in the Days of <HI>Solomon:</HI> He rai&s;ed
<PB N="27" REF="34">
great but not heavy Taxes, for his Wi&s;dom had brought &s;uch a Balance of Trade to his Kingdom, that his People were well able to bear them; they never murmured at them till they got a weak Man for their King, who expected to reap what he had not &s;own; and I do not read (tho <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was the Seat of Empire, and <HI>Solomon</HI> was of the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI>) that there was any Difference made to the Prejudice of the Commerce of the re&s;t of the Tribes. I could wi&s;h to give you a Sketch of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> I&s;les united in one Intere&s;t and one Parliament, then might we hope for the Dominion of all the I&s;les of the Bay of <HI>Mexico</HI> and of the Ocean. A Dominion more open for us to acquire, and more ea&s;y to retain, than any the mo&s;t incon|&s;iderable Part of the Continent of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>There is one Thing to be lamented in our Management of Foreign Acqui&s;itions. We get an u&s;elels Acce&s;s of Land, at a great Expence of our People. We hardly ever make a new Subject; we do not natu|ralize and conciliate the Minds of the Na|tives where we come. And we have been in all Ages in the &s;ame Temper: We were near five hundred Years reducing <HI>Ireland:</HI> We &s;ent Soldiers thither, and gave them Land: They did not, indeed, &s;ettle methodically in great Numbers and make populous Co|lonies;
<PB N="28" REF="35">
but they built Ca&s;tles every where in the Country; made Alliances with the Natives, and degenerated by thou&s;ands, &s;o that the Task of reclaiming degenerate <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> was formerly more difficult than that of civilizing the Natives. And the Lo&s;&s;es which <HI>England</HI> &s;u&s;tained from Age to Age by this bad Policy have been &s;o large and &s;o frequent, that perhaps it might be affirmed with Truth, that more <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> have from Time to Time been &s;ent into <HI>Ireland</HI> than the pre&s;ent Number of its Inhabitants amount to. Had we &s;ent regular Colonies thither, and tran&s;|planted good Numbers of their Natives (e&s;pecially their Children) into the &s;everal Counties of <HI>England,</HI> we &s;hould &s;oon have found it a profitable Undertaking. This was the Method of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> too, and now is only practiced by the <HI>Turk:</HI> He takes from <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> great Numbers of Children, and makes them the mo&s;t bigotted <HI>Mu&s;&s;elmen:</HI> They recruit his Armies, and indeed without this Policy, it were impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have <HI>Mahome|tan</HI> Subjects: Such has been the Profu&s;ion of Blood in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Wars, and &s;o nu|merous are the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> within tho&s;e Do|minions.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes thought it bad Oeco|nomy, that our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> and <HI>African</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="36">
Companies do not by Degrees buy up and educate &s;ome hundreds of the Children of the Natives where their Settlements are, and breed them Chri&s;tians and Soldiers from Father to Son. It is a fond Partiality to fancy they would have le&s;s Faith or le&s;s Courage than tho&s;e who are &s;ent from hence: I am per&s;uaded they would have the Advantage in both Re&s;pects; they might ea&s;ily know more Religion and le&s;s Vice than the People who generally take tho&s;e Journies; would better endure the Climates; and as for Courage and Military Skill, the&s;e are chiefly to be acquired: The Nations have had and lo&s;t them in their Turns. The Proprietors in the&s;e Com|panies are more than Tenants for Life; their Stock goes to their Executors; and if the Companies E&s;tate advances in Value, &s;o does every Share of each Proprietor: This ought to encourage them to provide for the future. Nor would it be found a grievous Burthen on the common Stock to execute &s;uch a Scheme: Food being cheap, and but little Rayment nece&s;&s;ary in all the Settlements, the Expence might be defrayed by the Labour of the Children, except the prime Co&s;t of purcha&s;ing them.</P>

I &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e People have got the&s;e pretty Notions in <HI>Flander;</HI> by conver&s;ing with out <HI>German</HI> Allies, this free-Quarter with a new Name, the very Bane of the Empire, and what mu&s;t in Proce&s;s of Time e&s;tabli&s;h the Do|minion of <HI>France</HI> over the greate&s;t Part of <HI>Germany.</HI> Tho&s;e Princes look on free Quarters as a more compendious Method of maintaining an Army than regular Pay|ments; and in&s;tead of taking a Part of the Farmer's Wealth, they &s;uffer him to be robbed of All.</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> and even the <HI>Turks,</HI> tho' they wa&s;te an Enemy's Country with Fire and Sword, yet govern their Subjects with a milder Sway. Hence it is that the People who have fir&s;t experienced the <HI>Ger|man,</HI> and afterwards either of the other two Soveraigns, &s;eldom care to return to
<PB N="33" REF="40">
their old Allegiance. And yet the <HI>Par|liament</HI> cannot &s;ee this. Tyranny has &s;urely a great Mixture of Folly or Madne&s;s in its Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome of our Colonels who rob an Officer under Colour of Cloath|ing him: They oblige him to take his Cloaths from whom and at what Rate they plea&s;e; &s;uppo&s;e at twenty Pounds what is worth twelve at mo&s;t. As if there was any Difference between robbing a Man, and forcing him to buy at your own Price. The Officer thus plundered, naturally &s;eeks to reimbur&s;e him&s;elf.&mdash;<HI>Torva Leaena Lupum &s;equitur, Lupus ip&s;e Capellam.</HI> The King has broke one of the Colonels for it. And if one &s;ingle Rea&s;on did not interpo&s;e, I could be content that a King of <HI>England</HI> were as Ab&s;olute as the Grand Signior over the Officers of his Army or Revenue. I am not afraid that he would be at a Lo&s;s for want of Colonels or Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, Captains or Collectors. They would only be more tender of tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ing with an Halter about their Necks, than they are now, when the greate&s;t Puni&s;h|ment that can befal them is, to be turned out of Employment. A Puni&s;hment which &s;ome of them may find it worth their While to undergo.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="41">
The Objection again&s;t &s;uch a Regulation is only this, that Officers who were to live under &s;uch Ab&s;olute Power would be apt to obey without Re&s;erve; and that blind Obedience might become fatal to the Liberties of their Country. Since then the Crown is not to be tru&s;ted with doing &s;um|mary Ju&s;tice, I think it would be well if the Parliament took it into their own Hands; and had a &s;tanding Committee for that Pur|po&s;e, in which no Officer &s;hould &s;it.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed that every Field-Officer and Captain too had a better Re|venue in Land than the annual Value of his Commi&s;&s;ion; and even then, I would exclude him from Parliament and Parlia|mentary Elections, becau&s;e he &s;hould not have it in his Power to burthen the Sub|jects to fill his own Pockets. But we have many Soldiers of Fortune in great Po&s;ts, who take large Strides to rai&s;e Families at once. What Wonder then to &s;ee a Country pillaged by Free-Quarter? A Regiment cheated of its Cloathing? or fraudulent Bargains driven for Bread or Forage? when the Profit of a &s;ingle Contract, may be greater than the Value of the Po&s;t that may be lo&s;t by it.</P>
<P>The publick Bu&s;ine&s;s (1694) has been at a Stand while we have been opening a new Scene, tracing the &s;ecret Methods which are
<PB N="35" REF="42">
&s;ometimes pur&s;ued in procuring Bills to pa&s;s in Parliament. It &s;eems the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company have been placing Sums in proper Hands. The Speaker and Mr. <HI>Hunger|ford</HI> are expelled, the Speaker's Bribe was one thou&s;and Pounds, Mr. <HI>Hungerford</HI>'s but poor thirty Guineas. Surely he thought, he was taking a Fee in <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter-Hall!</HI> it is unhappy for us that &s;uch In&s;tances are found in our Senate. <HI>Venalis Populus, Venalis Curia Patrum,</HI> was the State of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;inking into Slavery; it is a Symptom of a di&s;tempered Con&s;titution, and threatens our De&s;truction, if we do not aid our&s;elves with brisk Remedies. It ca&s;ts the &s;evere&s;t Blemi&s;h on the Age we live in, that even a rea&s;onable Bill &s;hall meet with Rubs, and perhaps mi&s;carry, if it do not purcha&s;e its Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>I believe it was never doubted, but the Corruption of Bribery alone, has always been &s;ufficient to ruin any free People among whom it grew predominant; unle&s;s you will chu&s;e to &s;ay, that it never came alone. It is attended with fal&s;e Friend&s;hip, Breach of Faith, Perjury, neglect of the publick Intere&s;t, in&s;atiable Avarice, pub|lick Poverty, private Wealth, boundle&s;s Luxury, endle&s;s Extortion, Fraud in all Offices, Rapine and Oppre&s;&s;ion in all the Provinces. It is no Wonder in &s;uch a Si|tuation
<PB N="36" REF="43">
that the People &s;hould wi&s;h for a Change of any Sort, for like a &s;ick Per&s;on in grievous bodily Pain, they flatter them|&s;elves that any Alteration mu&s;t happen for the better.</P>
<P>And yet to get rid of this Army of Mon&s;ters, I never can think it nece&s;&s;ary to have Recour&s;e to <HI>Lycurgus</HI>'s Scheme, to bani&s;h Gold and Silver, and leave no better Money than Iron. This Expedient might &s;uit a Tract of Land about the Size of one of our Counties, inhabited by ten or twen|ty thou&s;and Families who lived upon their Labour and the Fruits of their own Soil; but the World is not thus divided at this Day. We could not &s;et forth a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fleet on &s;uch a Fund, to keep what we have got abroad, or even to maintain us in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Home.</P>
<P>We need only go to <HI>Holland</HI> to ob&s;erve that a People may love Money very well, without having an Opportunity to &s;ell Ju&s;tice or their Country. There will al|ways be found a &s;ufficient Number of hone&s;t Men to &s;erve the State, if you reduce the Value of the great Employments Ninety <HI>per Cent,</HI> from Thou&s;ands to Hundreds <HI>per Ann.</HI> A good Man will only de&s;ire to be indemnified as to the Expences of his Attendance (Moderate Expences I mean). Thus may the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
<PB N="37" REF="44">
Offices be filled with the worthie&s;t Patriots unrivalled by the Mercenaries. But in&s;tead of reducing great Employments to the Value of a competent Sub&s;i&s;tence for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; we can &s;hew a &s;ingle Po&s;t, which half a Dozen People may enjoy at once, and every one of them make a For|tune by it.</P>
<P>The exorbitant Grants (1695/6) which have been made to &s;ome Favourites have ju&s;tly rou|&s;ed the Spirit of the Commons of <HI>England.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> particularly has &s;o far exceeded all Bounds of Mode&s;ty, that he has got little le&s;s than the Principality of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the Lands and Lord&s;hips that &s;hould &s;upport the Heir-Apparent of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> are given to this Lord. The Hou&s;e has this Day unanimou&s;ly addre&s;&s;ed again&s;t this Grant, and had a gracious An&s;wer, that it &s;hould be re&s;umed. They came into this Temper chiefly in Con&s;equence of an incomparable Speech which Mr. <HI>Price</HI> the Lawyer made on the Occa&s;ion: It has that Eloquence and &s;trong rea&s;oning in it, which are worthy the Character of a Man of Learning and Under&s;tanding, and that bold Freedom which becomes an <HI>Engli&s;h Patriot</HI> in his Place in Parliament. When great Men obtain Grants like the&s;e, it is well they do not ask the Kingdom al&s;o. I &s;end
<PB N="38" REF="45">
you an Extract of Mr. <HI>Price</HI>'s Speech, <HI>viz.</HI> This Petition, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> tho' &s;ub&s;cribed only by a few Hands has the Approbation of many Thou&s;ands who are not influenced by their own Intere&s;t, but act for the Honour of the Crown and Welfare of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>If I could conceive how the Glory and Grandeur of <HI>England</HI> is, or can be upheld by a poor landle&s;s Crown, and a mi&s;erable nece&s;&s;itous People, I might then be ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to believe, that his Maje&s;ty is well advi&s;ed to grant away all the Reve|nues of the Crown; and that his Govern|ment will thereby be well &s;ecured, and his People be&s;t protected, when they have little or nothing left; but I am &s;ure they are not <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but foreign Politicians, who can revere the King and yet hate his People The Kings of <HI>England</HI> al|ways reign be&s;t, when they have the Af|fections of their Subjects of which they are &s;ecure when the People are &s;en&s;ible, the King is entirely in their Intere&s;t, and loves the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Soil as well as the People's Money.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s that my Thoughts are troubled with &s;trange Apprehen&s;ions of our deplorable State: We are in a Con|federacy in War; and &s;ome of tho&s;e Con|federates
<PB N="39" REF="46">
our Enemies in Trade, tho' planted among&s;t us, &s;ome in the King's Council; &s;ome in the Army; and the Common Traders have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the Outskirts of this great City. We find &s;ome of them Naturalized and others made Denizens; In every Parliament we find En|deavours for a general Naturalization, and that warmly &s;ollicited from Court.</P>
<P>We &s;ee our good Coin all gone, and our Confederates openly coining <HI>Dutch</HI> Money of a ba&s;e Alloy for us. We &s;ee mo&s;t Places of Power and Profit given to Foreigners. We &s;ee our Confederates in Conjunction with the <HI>Scots</HI> to ruin our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade. We &s;ee the Revenues of the Crown daily given away to one or other, who make Sale of them, and tran&s;|mit their E&s;tates el&s;ewhere. We do not find any of them buy Lands or E&s;tates among&s;t us; but what they can get from us they &s;ecure in their own Country. How can we hope for happy Days in <HI>England,</HI> when This great Lord, and the Other, Foreigners (tho' Naturalized) are in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and al&s;o in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Coun|cils? If the&s;e Strangers (tho' now Con|federates) &s;hould be of different Intere&s;ts (as mo&s;t plainly they are in Point of Trade) to which Intere&s;t is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed tho&s;e great Foreign Coun&s;ellors and Favourites
<PB N="40" REF="47">
would adhere? So that I fore&s;ee, that when we are reduced to extreme Poverty (as now we are very near it) we are to be &s;upplanted by our Neighbours, and become a Colony to the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall make no &s;evere Remarks on this great Man, for his Greatne&s;s makes us Little, and will make the Crown both poor and precarious; and when GOD &s;hall plea&s;e to &s;end us a Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> he may have &s;uch a Pre&s;ent of a Crown made him as a Pope did to King <HI>John,</HI> who was Sur-named <HI>Sans-Terre,</HI> and was by his Father, King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd, made Lord of <HI>Ireland:</HI> Which Grant was confirmed by the Pope, who &s;ent him a Crown of Peacock's Fea|thers, in Deri&s;ion of his Power, and the Poverty of his Revenue.</P>
<P>I would have us to con&s;ider that we are <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and mu&s;t (like good Patriots) &s;tand by our Country, and not &s;uffer it to become tributary to Strangers. We have rejoiced that we have beat out of this Kingdom Popery and Slavery, and do now with as great Joy entertain Sociniani&s;m and Poverty, and yet we &s;ee our Properties daily given away, and our Liberties mu&s;t &s;oon follow.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire Redre&s;s rather than Puni&s;hment; therefore I &s;hall neither move for an Im|peachment again&s;t this noble Lord, nor for
<PB N="41" REF="48">
the Bani&s;hment of Him; but &s;hall only beg that he may have no Power over us, nor we any Dependance upon Him.</P>
<P>Then he concluded with a Motion for the Addre&s;s. <HI>March</HI> 24, 1698-9.</P>
<P>I remember it was always your Opinion and mine, that Liberty might be in Dan|ger as much under a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Prince as under a <HI>Papi&s;t.</HI> It &s;eems the collective Wi&s;dom of the Nation is of the &s;ame Judgment, for they have re&s;olved to &s;end the Red Coats to learn the Arts of Peace in all the Counties and Boroughs of the King|dom. They make them in Effect free of all Corporations, and have re&s;olved that &s;even thou&s;and Men here, and twelve thou|&s;and in <HI>Ireland</HI> are a &s;ufficient Land Force. The Courtiers had a large Field to expa|tiate in, concerning the embroiled Condition of <HI>Europe</HI> abroad (notwith&s;tanding the new Peace,) and the dangerous exten&s;ive Di&s;affection at Home: But the Genius of <HI>England</HI> has prevailed. We are not now to be Slaves. His Maje&s;ty, under who&s;e Au&s;pices we have learned to mortgage the Kingdom, is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;uffer us to &s;ee a Po&s;&s;ibility of redeeming it. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Guards &s;tuck much with Him, but they mu&s;t al&s;o be gone. He is too wi&s;e a Prince not to know that the Ca&s;ui&s;try upon the Titles of contending Pretenders to the
<PB N="42" REF="49">
Crown is but a Trifle in the Con&s;idera|tion of the Multitude; it &s;urmounts their Theory. The true Ground and Rea&s;on of Loyalty or Di&s;affection in the Populace is nothing el&s;e but the Sen&s;e of their own pre&s;ent Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery; and let who will reign, he can never have the Affec|tions of a People whom he burthens with Taxes to pay for the In&s;urance of their own Slavery. A Prince perhaps may have his Option, whether he will govern a People by Force, or found his Authority upon their Affections: He has no Need of (and, I am much mi&s;taken if he can have) Both.</P>
<P>The Courtiers have been very loud upon the Topick of our Obligation to the King, for the Benefits we have received from him, and in particular, for this la&s;t Act of Con|de&s;cention: For my Part, it gives me the Spleen to hear &s;uch Stuff. Surely the&s;e Men would make us believe that we were born the Slaves of &s;ome Ea&s;tern Monarch, that we enjoy our Liberties by a Gift re|vocable at Plea&s;ure, and that they are not our Birth-right and Inheritance. Men who advance Notions of this Tendency de&s;erve the Gibbet equally with <HI>Garnet</HI> the Je&s;uit and <HI>Oliver Cromwell;</HI> as being equally Traitors to their Country.</P>
<P>The King indeed ran the Ri&s;que of con|ducting our Efforts for Liberty and Reli|gion;
<PB N="43" REF="50">
we have &s;ucceeded, we have paid the Expence of the Undertaking, and rai&s;ed him to the Throne for his Pains. What is more to be done? I hope I am a very good Prote&s;tant, but I am &s;ure I never did de&s;ign to truck away all other Rights of an <HI>Eng|li&s;hman</HI> for a Deliverance only from King <HI>James</HI>'s Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Tyranny. Were our other Rights extingui&s;hed, our Religion would be al&s;o precarious; <HI>Orthodox</HI> with <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> and <HI>Arian</HI> with <HI>Con&s;tantius.</HI> Such a Deliverance would be Prote&s;tanti&s;m with a Witne&s;s. It would bring us under a very lively De&s;cription of biggotted Mad|ne&s;s, which I &s;hall not attempt to tran&s;late, but here tran&s;cribe to &s;ave you the Trouble of turning to it.<Q><L>Jupiter, ingentes qui das, adimi&s;que Dolores,</L>

<P>We are at la&s;t (1701) come to the &s;everal Re&s;olutions, which I &s;end you inclo&s;ed, about &s;etling the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown; a Point of the utmo&s;t importance to the&s;e Kingdoms, and of no &s;mall Moment even to the mo&s;t
<PB N="44" REF="51">
con&s;iderable Powers in <HI>Europe. France, Spain,</HI> the <HI>Empire</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> are mo&s;t particularly attentive to this critical Step; for I believe it is by this Time well under&s;tood that the two late Kings were duped into the Mea&s;ures of <HI>France,</HI> and had no Concern to pre&s;erve the Balance of Power in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Duche&s;s of <HI>Savoy</HI> is as importunate to have her Birth-right con&s;idered at this Juncture, as the Duke's Mini&s;ter was ful&s;ome in his Compliment upon the Revolution; yet &s;urely they mu&s;t have then fore&s;een their Preten|&s;ions would be prejudiced by that grand Event. We have thrown the Popi&s;h Pedi|grees out of the Que&s;tion: You &s;ee we do not meddle with the Prince's Birth; if it could be proved &s;uppo&s;ititious, that would not remove our Difficulties: We in&s;i&s;t on the Security of our Religion as well as our Laws; we have &s;een how weak the Bonds of Duty, of Promi&s;es and of Oaths are upon a Popi&s;h Prince, and therefore we cannot &s;cruple to exclude a Multitude of the De&s;cendants of King <HI>Charles</HI> the 1&s;t, in Favour of his Si&s;ter's Children. It is indeed a Wonder that this Work was not begun and per&s;ected many Years ago, for the Occa&s;ion was little le&s;s than at pre&s;ent, except the Chance of the Duke of <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter</HI>'s Life.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="52">
I fear you will ob&s;erve &s;ome Cobweb-Nets, or Ropes of Sand in our Re&s;trictions upon the Succe&s;&s;ors: We &s;ay he &s;hall not go out of the Kingdom without Con&s;ent of Parliament. If he &s;hould not meet with Parliaments kind enough to con&s;ent <HI>Gratis,</HI> and his Inclinations be very &s;trong for a Tour abroad, he may learn to buy Leave perhaps, once for all by getting the Clau&s;e repealed: And (which is wor&s;e!) Corrup|tions of all kinds are in their Effects very like Fornication; it frequently happens that Women <HI>&s;in</HI> the fir&s;t Time without a De&s;ign to make a Practice of it; their De|&s;ires draw them in only (as they imagine) to gratify them&s;elves <HI>pro ill&acirc; vice;</HI> but the like Appetite recurs on fre&s;h Occa&s;ions; frequent Acts grow into a Habit; and the &s;ame Per&s;on who felt a quick Compunction for the fir&s;t Fault, now thinks it a Fault no longer, and is in&s;en&s;ible of Remor&s;e and Shame. And indeed I think that Re&s;tric|tion a very idle one. Is it to be feared, that the Elector of <HI>Hanover</HI> (to put the Ca&s;e &s;tronger than that of the Dowager Duche&s;s) could attempt to make his Electorate the Seat of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire; could he think him&s;elf &s;afe in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown if he were to fall upon &s;o ridiculous a Project? A Prince of Common-Sen&s;e has no Occa&s;ion for this Re&s;triction; and if
<PB N="46" REF="53">
we had a Fool &s;o ab&s;urd, it were no Matter what became of him. A brave, a wi&s;e, a good King may have Occa&s;ions to go abroad, highly beneficial in their Con&s;e|quences to this Kingdom; and I think we may believe, without taking any Security for it, that <HI>England</HI> will continue the Seat of Empire till it falls under the Sway of a Soveraign who has another Dominion at lea&s;t equal to it.</P>
<P>But that Article which &s;eems of mo&s;t Im|portance in Favour of <HI>England</HI> (and which would be truly valuable if it were po&s;&s;ible duly to fulfil and ob&s;eve it) will be found either <HI>unju&s;t</HI> or <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> in the Execu|tion. It is that which provides&mdash;We &s;hall not involve our&s;elves in the Quarrels or Defence of the Dominions on the Con|tinent, which may belong to the Succe&s;&s;or. With all due Loyalty to his Maje&s;ty and Deference to the Prince&s;s <HI>Anne</HI> and her Hopes of I&s;&s;ue; let us &s;uppo&s;e an Elector of <HI>Hanover</HI> on the Throne of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that he may have Occa&s;ion to quarrel for the Rights of the&s;e King|doms with any of his great Neighbours on the Continent; as &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Swede,</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> the <HI>Pole,</HI> the <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian,</HI> the <HI>Saxon,</HI> or the <HI>Au&s;trian;</HI> Will they take a Bull by the Horns?

<P>I believe nobody can doubt, that the fine Webs of Politicks may be &s;o intri|cately woven, and the Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;o much embara&s;&s;ed, that private Gentle|men will prove but very indifferent Judges to determine this Que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether it be only Knight-Errantry, or Nece&s;&s;ary Ju&s;tice in this Kingdom at &s;uch or &s;uch a Time to be at the Expence of protecting the Electorate? or to know what is the true Foundation of the Pre&s;ent Quarrel?</P>
<P>We &s;hould remember that notwith&s;tand|ing all our Precautions on this Head, the Power of making War and Peace will &s;till re&s;ide in the Crown. It is true the Right
<PB N="48" REF="55">
of giving Money is in the Commons, and they may refu&s;e to provide for the Wan|toune&s;s of Ambition. I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to call the Separation of the&s;e Powers, <HI>of rai&s;ing Armies</HI> and <HI>of rai&s;ing Money,</HI> a Soleci&s;m in our Con&s;titution; nor &s;ay where I would have them re&s;ide, if to be repo&s;ed in one Con&s;tituent-part of the Legi&s;lature; but thus much I may ob&s;erve (becau&s;e <HI>Charles</HI> II. tho' an indolent Prince, gave us a flagrant Proof of it in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet at <HI>Chatham</HI>) that if our King makes War without Mo|ney; not he, but we are to be the Sufferers, and &s;hall then find this Truth,&mdash;<HI>delirant Reges, plectuntur Achivi.</HI> I mu&s;t make one further Ob&s;ervation of an Hard&s;hip the Electorate might endure for the Sake of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Contrary to the De|ci&s;ions of all the Schoolmen and Ca&s;ui&s;ts, it is &s;ettled as a Principle in the Law of Nations by the Practice of modern Poli|ticians and their Ma&s;ters; that, if your Neighbour is too powerful, it is a ju&s;t Cau&s;e of making War upon him. Now perhaps there is hardly at this Day a little Prince in all <HI>Germany,</HI> who would not exert him&s;elf in Defence of the Electorate as it &s;tands alone: But for the Rea&s;on given, the Que&s;tion would be widely different if the &s;ame Territory were only a &s;mall Part of the Dominions of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> King; they
<PB N="49" REF="56">
would then perhaps con&s;ider the Balance of Power in a new Light; and the more jealous our Neighbours were grown of the Conjunction, the more &s;hould we be con|cerned in Honour and common Sen&s;e to defend &s;o near an Ally, and to &s;upply the Want of all other Confederates.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood on the whole to &s;ay, that <HI>England</HI> would be the happier for &s;uch an Acce&s;s of Dominion on the Continent under the &s;ame Prince. I think quite otherwi&s;e; and heartily wi&s;h that we would, in Time, attempt the only Means to obviate all Difficulties. We might try to get it e&s;tabli&s;hed by a Law in the Empire, and certainly make it Part of the Act of Succe&s;&s;ion here, that this Crown devolving on the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> his Duchy and Electorate &s;hould <HI>co in&s;tante</HI> dive&s;t out of him in Favour of &s;ome Prote&s;tant of his Family. I am not at all apprehen&s;ive of his rejecting the Crown on the&s;e Terms; but if they be not previou&s;ly made a Con|dition of the Succe&s;&s;ion, it will be idle and unrea&s;onable to expect a Compliment of that Importance afterwards. Now is our Time while we have in our own Hands a Value abundantly more than equivalent to give for it. It will be too late to make Bargains after we have made a Pre&s;ent of that Equivalent.</P>

It is true, the King had a Fall, and broke his Collar Bone: But this was not the Cau&s;e of his Death. His Exit about this time was unavoidable, had he not fallen at all; his Lungs were emaciated and inflamed, and nothing but <HI>Medea</HI>'s Kettle could have been of Service to him.</P>
<P>He has left us under the Conduct of a Woman, at the Beginning of a War, probably the mo&s;t raging and exten&s;ive that <HI>Europe</HI> has felt within the&s;e hundred Years: And under the Protection of a Woman, about a Century ago, we hap|pily &s;u&s;tained the mo&s;t dangerous Shock that has been attempted to our Prejudice within the&s;e &s;ix hundred Years.</P>

<P>I AM per&s;uaded you have great Satisfac|tion in the News of the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Gift of the Fir&s;t Fruits and Tenths to the poor Clergy, as it is a &s;trong Proof of her Zeal for our E&s;tabli&s;hed Religion. The <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors who per&s;ecuted Chri&s;ti|anity before the Days of <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo|&s;tate, <HI>occiderunt Presbyteros;</HI> but he, in Appearance more moderate, tho' in Truth wilier and more malicious than his Prede|ce&s;&s;ors, <HI>occidit Presbyterium.</HI> He &s;poil|ed the Churchmen of their Means of Li|ving, and by this Method had well nigh de&s;troyed the Prie&s;thood, Starving is doubtle&s;s as effectual a Form for Death to a&s;&s;ume, as any other, and perhaps one of the mo&s;t terrible Forms it can a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>The <HI>Queen</HI>'s Piety on this Occa&s;ion is the Contra&s;t of <HI>Julian</HI>'s Malice; there is no|thing wanting to compleat the Merit of the
<PB N="55" REF="62">
De&s;ign, but to &s;ub&s;titute the Word Re&s;ti|tution, in&s;tead of Bounty or Donation: However, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that there was much to be &s;aid to ju&s;tify the Right of the Crown to this Branch of Church-Revenues, which King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. laid his Hands on; for this Revenue had been for Ages enjoyed by the <HI>Pope,</HI> as Head of the Church, therefore theve&s;t|ing it in the Crown, was but a natural Con&s;equence of our throwing off the u&s;urped Supremacy of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>What farther enhances the Merit of this Gift, is the pre&s;ent Exigency of Publick Affairs: It is done at a Juncture when the Crown is not in a giving Condition. It is to be hoped that late Po&s;terity who &s;hall enjoy the Benefit of it, will revere the Memory of the pious Donor; and that our &s;ucceeding Monarchs may be ex|cited by this laudable Example, to rai&s;e up the drooping Head of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church, plundered and covered with Rags by an unbelieving Prince, and his &s;acrile|gious Creatures, under the Veil of Refor|mation. A Prince more dangerous to the Chri&s;tian Religion, than <HI>Julian</HI> or <HI>Attila,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>he communed with it in the Hou&s;e of God, as a Friend.</HI> His Title of De|fender of the Faith gave him an Oppor|tunity to de&s;troy his Charge, that Church,
<PB N="56" REF="63">
which is always in the Condition of a Mi|nor.</P>
<P>I am here induced to lament the Ava|rice of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, who when they had an ample Dominion over the Minds of Men, gra&s;ped at too great a Share of the good Things of this World; they were not content with a competent Income; they thought their Power, their Revenues, their Number could never be &s;ufficiently augmented. The&s;e Maxims, joined to their Vows of Celibacy, which took in both Sexes, and their Care to conceal their Shame when they broke the&s;e Vows, ren|dered them Enemies to Society, to Hu|man Nature. And as Reformations are too apt to run into an Extream, oppo&s;ite to the Evil de&s;igned to be remedied, the Church of <HI>England</HI> has dearly paid for the Avarice of that of <HI>Rome:</HI> Men know|ing that the Church had obtained too much, ea&s;ily took up a Notion that they could not leave her too little. They knew that the Monks in dark Ages, had importuned from the Fears of intimidated dying Sinners, unrea&s;onable Grants of great E&s;tates, and along with the&s;e, the Reforming Generation made no Scruple to rob the Church of its Natural Inheritance, which it had enjoyed from the Piety of pure&s;t Times, in Imi|tation of a Pattern given by God him&s;elf,
<PB N="57" REF="64">
when he conde&s;cended to compile a Body of Laws both Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical for the Government of his cho&s;en People.</P>
<P>The Land which had been given by &s;u|per&s;titious Penitents, to found or endow the Nur&s;eries of Religious Idlene&s;s, were perhaps very properly re&s;umed in Favour of the Crown, rather than of the Heirs of the Donors; for had they been re&s;tor|ed to the latter, it would have produced &s;uch infinite Confu&s;ion among the Claim|ants, as probably would have redounded le&s;s to their Benefit and the Nation's, than the Method which was taken. But does it al&s;o follow, that there could be a Difficulty to a&s;certain the right Owners of the Paro|chial Tithes, which were found in the Hands of the Mona&s;teries? It was ea&s;y to know that the Mona&s;teries had taken them from the Pari&s;h-Prie&s;ts, and by wor&s;e Means, if po&s;&s;ible, than their Influence over the &s;taggering Re&s;olutions of dying Men. They robbed the &s;ecular Clergy with a &s;trong Hand, by the Aid of the u&s;urped arbitrary Power of the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> which was wrought upon by Mo|ney to interpo&s;e in Favour of the Regu|lars; not without an Eye to &s;ome political Maxims, little le&s;s than Trea&s;onable; for the Allegiance of the Subject was divided, by that Soleci&s;m in Politicks, <HI>imperium in</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="65">
<HI>imperio;</HI> and frequent Experience told us, that the Regulars knew no Soveraign but the <HI>Pope.</HI> The&s;e Sufferings of the Paro|chial Clergy were not a Rea&s;on, at the Reformation, why they &s;hould not be re|&s;tored to their own.</P>
<P>Indeed if it &s;hall happen that the Chri|&s;tian Temper of Po&s;terity one way or other &s;hall bring back the Tithes, or an Equivalent for them, to the Church, I &s;hould never wi&s;h that it might be endow|ed with great E&s;tates in Lands into the Bargain. My only De&s;ire is, that Religion may not &s;uffer by making the Clergy con|temptible, who will always be held in Contempt, if they are obliged to live in Poverty.</P>
<P>In the mean while there might be &s;ome other Expedients found out, that would contribute to place them in a comfortable Condition to attend their great Charge, the Care of Souls. There are too many Pari&s;hes in <HI>England,</HI> both in City and Country: It is true, there are &s;ome Pari&s;hes too large, which ought to be di|vided; but there are a great many more too &s;mall, which would be better united: Two or three in&s;ufficient Provi&s;ions for &s;o many Pa&s;tors of little and ill attended Flocks, may amount to a competent Main|tainance for one able Mini&s;ter, who may
<PB N="59" REF="66">
do his Duty with Satisfaction to a decent Congregation.</P>
<P>Perhaps al&s;o it is not now nece&s;&s;ary that the Revenues of Colleges &s;hould be as ample as formerly for the Education of Youth, when the Nation is over&s;tocked with Learning already, and there are not Benefices &s;ufficient to receive the Men who have gone thro' the Cour&s;e of their Aca|demical Studies. I could therefore rejoice that we had fewer People educated on Charity to fill the Church; not at all dreading the Want of a Supply from tho&s;e of better Fortunes, if we could contrive to advance the Benefices to a rea&s;onable Value; which would be much furthered by taking away &s;ome Superfluities of Schools and Colleges, and be&s;towing them in the Endowment of the Church, where they are mo&s;t wanted. I am far from thinking it for the Benefit of Religion or of the Nation, to dimini&s;h the Number of Profe&s;&s;ors or Fellows in either Univer&s;ity. It will always be nece&s;&s;ary to the Perma|nency of &s;ound Learning, that there &s;hould be a con&s;iderable Number of Men of good Parts and Education maintained at full Lei&s;ure to attend their Studies in every Branch of Literature. But will this al&s;o prove that there is a National Advantage in bringing forward yearly, at the publick
<PB N="60" REF="67">
Expence, an hundred Per&s;ons to the Degree of Batchelor of Arts, who know not af|terwards which Way to turn them&s;elves, and have Rea&s;on to wi&s;h, that in&s;tead of reading <HI>Ramus</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> they had been taught to throw the Shuttle, or hold the Plough of their Fore-Fathers.</P>
<P>A poor Man may be as hone&s;t as a rich one, but it is not generally &s;o ea&s;y to tempt the latter into mean and &s;candalous Actions. The Nece&s;&s;ities of &s;ome of the lowe&s;t of the Clergy, are apt to lead them into Mi&s;|takes that cau&s;e a Clamour again&s;t the very Prie&s;thood, and do a real Di&s;&s;ervice to Religion. And yet the&s;e meane&s;t of the People <HI>(who &s;eek the Prie&s;t's Office, that they may eat a Piece of Bread)</HI> are im|mediately ready to fancy them&s;elves Gen|tlemen, and that their Families are al&s;o advanced in Blood and Degree. Hence it happens in their Oeconomy, that during the Father's Life-time, the Son is bred at a Free-&s;chool, undoubtedly de&s;igned to be a Bi&s;hop at lea&s;t; the Father drops off, and then the poor Youth is glad to find Em|ployment as a Drawer in a Tavern, or per|haps to wear a Livery, and it is well if no wor&s;e happens. As for the Daughter, &s;he learns to dance, and play on Mu&s;ical In&s;truments; and becau&s;e &s;he is a Gentle|woman, &s;he &s;corns to do the Offices of a
<PB N="61" REF="68">
Country Hou&s;ewife at home, or to go to Market along with the Wives and Daugh|ters of the Neighbouring Farmers. Her Education is like that which the unhappy Gentry of <HI>Georgia</HI> are &s;aid to give their Daughters to fit them for the Seraglios of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Grandees, and the Event is often wor&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible. The be&s;t Pro&s;pect after &s;uch an Education, is an ho|ne&s;t Servitude.</P>
<P>Which of the Bi&s;hops (if he has not made him&s;elf remarkable for Moro&s;ene&s;s) is not daily pe&s;tered with Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Beg|gars, the pretended or real Widows and Orphans of indigent Clergymen, be&s;ides Crouds of indigent Clergymen them&s;elves. I do not ob&s;erve the&s;e Facts, as believing it improper for Clergymen to marry; but being of Opinion, that tho&s;e of them who marry and cannot &s;ave any thing for their Families, &s;hould at lea&s;t teach them to en|dure and work thro' that low State of Life they are born to: And I al&s;o con&s;ider it as a Rea&s;on for augmenting the Value, tho' we &s;hould con&s;iderably dimini&s;h the Number, of Benefices in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I rejoice as an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> that our Clergy are rather ten thou&s;and than an hundred thou&s;and: There are the fewer idle Hands in the Nation, compared with its
<PB N="62" REF="69">
<HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Neighbours, therefore our Wealth is the greater.</P>
<P>I rejoice al&s;o that the&s;e ten thou&s;and are not re&s;trained from Marriage: For, this &s;ingle Advantage will in a few Gene|rations &s;pread the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion over <HI>Europe,</HI> by our gradual Increa&s;e of People and the Decrea&s;e of the <HI>Papi&s;ts;</HI> unle&s;s the Almighty, for his own &s;ecret Purpo&s;es, &s;hall &s;end &s;ome more Kings to reign in <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI> Kingdoms, like the pre&s;ent King of <HI>Sweden.</HI> Were it not that <HI>Cromwell</HI> (in too great Ha&s;te to &s;ettle that mi&s;erable King|dom of <HI>Ireland</HI>) gave va&s;t Multitudes of the Natives to the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> and that the late Revolution, and &s;ome Laws which followed it relating to Religion, and others concerning Trade, have &s;ent great Numbers of the &s;ame People to <HI>France</HI> (all which have been replaced by the Natives of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> be&s;ides our large Export to our <HI>American</HI> Colonies) <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> be|fore this mu&s;t have felt more &s;en&s;ibly, how burthen&s;ome their Religion is to the State: And the&s;e our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> I&s;lands would have grown up by this Time as populous as the <HI>United Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be pretended that the taking away the Funds from the Scholar&s;hips, and Exhibitions in the Free-Schools and the Uni|ver&s;ities, to apply them to the Augmenta|tion
<PB N="63" REF="70">
of poor Livings, can work an Injury to any one; it is true, that whoever is in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an Income of that Nature, ought to enjoy his legal E&s;tate in it; but on the Vacancy, (no Individual having a Right) the Publick may well and ju&s;tly apply it to the mo&s;t laudable Purpo&s;e; and I believe it is hardly a Que&s;tion in our Age and Country, which is the more eligible Species of Charity, (the Education of poor Scholars, or Maintainance of poor Eccle|&s;ia&s;ticks with Cure of Souls?) To this I may add, that many of the E&s;tates which are in that unnece&s;&s;ary Method of Charity, were for a like Rea&s;on taken from another u&s;ele&s;s People and given to the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; who&s;e Number is now become a Nui&s;ance to the Nation.</P>

<P>THE Union is at length as good as concluded; it was hard, or rather impo&s;&s;ible, to &s;ettle the Terms of it to every body's liking, but the grand De|&s;ign was always de&s;irable to the Unpreju|diced of both Nations, and our late Blun|ders have made it more nece&s;&s;ary to us than ever it was.</P>

But the Pre|&s;ervation of the Kirk is at pre&s;ent a Con|dition without which no Union can be had; the Populace will not yet part with the <HI>Me&s;s Johns.</HI> That mu&s;t be expected in a cooler Sea&s;on, and then the funda|mental Article will be a Cobweb. It is ab&s;urd to attempt to make irrevocable Laws for Po&s;terity; every Generation mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity have a Right to chu&s;e for it|&s;elf. This ridiculous Notion of immutable Laws, was however a Maxim in Law among the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> Ob&s;erve the Con&s;equence: Their Emperor To-day pro|mulges an IMMUTABLE Edict to de|&s;troy all the <HI>Jews,</HI> and on the Morrow &s;ends forth another, that they may take Arms for their Defence, and that all his
<PB N="68" REF="75">
loving Subjects &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t them. Can any common Lawyer or Civilian deny, that there will be in the united Legi&s;lature of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> an unlimited Power over the whole Body, and every Part of it; or, that they will have &s;ufficient Authority to repeal any Law which either of the divi|ded Kingdoms made. What the <HI>Sultan</HI> is in <HI>Turky,</HI> and the <HI>Mogul</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be, in the Plenitude of its Power.</P>
<P>Another Complaint among us is, that the Members which <HI>Scotland</HI> furni&s;hes to both Hou&s;es, amount to a tenth or a twelfth of the Parliament, tho' they are not to pay above a thirtieth of the Taxes of the united Kingdom: I do not fear being &s;u&s;pected as a Partizan for the <HI>Scots,</HI> when I declare, that I believe this to be &s;till very equal; for tho' we leave them an open Trade, yet the Profits of that will be &s;wallowed in the Rents of all their be&s;t E&s;tates, and mu&s;t center in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Middle&s;ex.</HI> It will be well enough if the publick Mo|ney rai&s;ed among them &s;uffices to an&s;wer all the publick Demands there: Their great Men will live here, and in a Genera|tion or two will become mere <HI>Engli&s;h|men.</HI></P>
<P>There is one Omi&s;&s;ion in the Articles of this Union, with regard to the Perpe|tuity
<PB N="69" REF="76">
of the <HI>Scots</HI> Peerage. There are no new Peers to be made there, and they are always to &s;end &s;ixteen to Parliament, by Election. I believe their Number is pretty large at pre&s;ent, &s;uppo&s;e one hun|dred and fifty; but the&s;e will gradually decrea&s;e, and be extingui&s;hed by one Ac|cident or other, for there are no perpetual Succe&s;&s;ions, no Bi&s;hops among them. I lately ob&s;erved this to a very intelligent Gentleman of that Nation: He looked on it as a remote Evil, <HI>For,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>mo&s;t of the Peerages there, are inheritable by the Daughters, when Sons fail;</HI> I allowed this for a Rea&s;on why Peerages &s;hould not ea&s;ily be extingui&s;hed; but I am convinced, that thus they will more readily decrea&s;e by Unity of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, occa&s;ioned by Marriages both among their own Nobility and ours, which will have a quicker Effect than the Extinction of the Male-Lines by the Cour&s;e of Nature, &s;eparate Mainte|nance, and Venery. Almo&s;t as often as a <HI>Scots</HI> Coronet devolves upon a Female, it will con&s;olidate that Peerage with &s;ome other, &s;o that in Effect there is a <HI>Scots</HI> Peerage merged for ever.</P>
<P>There is another Way left open to di|mini&s;h their Number, for tho' a <HI>Scots</HI> Peer mu&s;t not be made an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> one, yet his Son or Brother may; and thus
<PB N="70" REF="77">
upon the Fall of one Life, there will be one Peer le&s;s on their Li&s;t. So it is likely they will hardly have &s;ixteen Lords left in an hundred Years. I have not been in|formed whether this Omi&s;&s;ion was by Mi&s;|take, but it is really of little or no Con|&s;equence. Since <HI>Scots</HI> are capable of being made Peers of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> it matters not from what Ca&s;tles, Towns or Villages they take their Titles, nor whether North or South of <HI>Tweed:</HI> It will only &s;ound a little ab&s;urd to Po&s;terity, that the &s;ame Per&s;on who may be called to Parliament as Lord of <HI>Hammer&s;mith,</HI> &s;hall be refu&s;ed Admittance as Duke of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> For the re&s;t, the Locality of Titles happens not to be material, for if this Kingdom pre&s;erves its Con&s;titution, Po&s;terity &s;hall always find mo&s;t of its large&s;t Fortunes and greate&s;t Men, in the Hou&s;e of Peers of <HI>Great-Britain:</HI> But if, for Our Sins or Theirs, our Po&s;terity &s;hall bow the Knee before a Tyrant, after the Manner of the Nations round about us, and the Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment in a Venal Generation concur to mur|der the Con&s;titution, it is a Matter of no Sort of Importance who &s;hall be the Parri|cides.</P>
<P>We might be content that the Numbers both of their Lords and Commons to &s;it in the United-Parliament were to be double or
<PB N="71" REF="78">
treble tho&s;e agreed on. Thus we &s;hould have more of their Wealth drawn hither, and our Con&s;titution would be &s;afer from the Attempts of the Crown, as it would be harder to manage or gratify &s;o great a Number. This is what we ought to attend to on all Occa&s;ions. I de&s;ign to make my Grand&s;ons learn it along with their Prayers and their Creed, That the <HI>Liberties of England can only be de&s;troyed by a Standing Army of her own Sons; and that Parlia|mentary Bribery is the mo&s;t proper Me|thod to obtain &s;uch an Army.</HI></P>
<P>And yet it is &s;trange, that Men can &s;ell them&s;elves and Po&s;terities for an E&s;tate at Will! You &s;hall find in &s;ome foreign Coun|tries a Man of Two Thou&s;and Pounds a Year of Inhertance, who for &s;o &s;mall a Bribe as an Office or Pen&s;ion of Five Hundred Pounds a Year, during Plea&s;ure, &s;hall give his Vote for a Law, which in its Con&s;equence renders his Inheritance as precarious as the Pen&s;ion. Is this being wi&s;e in our Generation? is this to be ju&s;tified even by the Wi&s;dom of the Children of this World?</P>
<P>What Age, what Kingdom can &s;hew an immediate Suce&s;&s;ion of three good ab&s;olute Monarchs? or in what Country have Liberty, Corruption and a Standing Army gone Hand in Hand for forty Years together? It is an idle Imagination to &s;uppo&s;e, that when a King de&s;igns to rule by his Will, he mu&s;t
<PB N="72" REF="79">
do as the <HI>Danes</HI> did, di&s;card his States, and rely upon his Troops. That is indeed the &s;horte&s;t Way, but not the &s;afe&s;t. When <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI> had e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf again&s;t all Op|po&s;ers, he did not covet a great Army, he cho&s;e to keep a packed Senate in Pay; he gulled the People with an Appearance of Liberty, and the Admini&s;tration of his Go|vernment was gentle: But <HI>Rome</HI> was ruined, it lo&s;t its Liberty, and was as effectually en|&s;laved under him, as under <HI>Nero</HI> or <HI>Domitian.</HI>
<Q><L>Mollia vincla pati ju&s;&s;it, at vincula pa&s;&s;a e&s;t;</L>
<L>Purpureum cultu in&s;olito venerata Tyrannum.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Thus while with Clemency <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> reign'd,</L>
<L>The Monarch was ador'd, the city chain'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>But tho' this be the &s;afe&s;t Method for a Prince to take, who de&s;ires to be ab&s;olute, yet it is the mo&s;t burthen&s;ome to the Peo|ple. Their Pen&s;ion-Senate is a more ex|travagant Charge upon them, than a great Army would be. If I were to live in an Age and Country where the Repre&s;entatives of the People had &s;old them to the Prince for Places and Pen&s;ions, and given him a Mili|tary Force to en&s;ure the Purcha&s;e; I would concur in and promote a Petition, that the Prince might a&s;&s;ume the Legi&s;lative Autho|rity, exclu&s;ive of &s;uch pro&s;titute Repre&s;en|tatives: and I think it is evident, that in &s;uch
<PB N="73" REF="80">
a Ca&s;e, whether a Prince were good or bad, a Wi&s;e Man or a Fool, the People could more ea&s;ily pay for the Wants or the Wan|tonne&s;s of the Monarch alone, than for tho&s;e and the Wages of &s;everal hundreds of Parricides into the Bargain.</P>
<P>Nor is a People the &s;afer from &s;uch At|tempts, for having a Ruler of their own chu&s;ing. The ambitious Man, when he has climbed all the Rounds of the Ladder of Authority, turns his Back to it, and &s;corns the ba&s;e Degrees by which he ro&s;e. In all mixed Governments, each con&s;tituent Part mu&s;t be eternally on its Guard. The Prince can ea&s;ily take Care of his Prero|gative, becau&s;e, being but one, he can al|ways be true to, and con&s;i&s;tent with him|&s;elf. His Individuality gives him tho&s;e Ad|vantages, and the <HI>Prae-exi&s;tent</HI> Temptation of Ambition, that Spur to make u&s;e of them, that he ought never to be tru&s;ted with more than his own Rights, if the Subjects would hold theirs. I tran&s;cribe for you the Pic|ture of a vigorous Prince, riding a Nation after he had defeated its Enemies.<Q><L>Cervus, equum, pugn&acirc; melior communibus herbis</L>
<L>Pellebat, donec minor in certamine longo</L>

Since I am grown a little pedantick upon the Subject of Slavery, I will put you in Mind of the ridiculous, the mi&s;erable Figure which a Mock-Senate makes: You have two beautiful Sketches of &s;uch A&s;&s;em|bles in <HI>Juvenal,</HI> proper to excite your Laughter and Indignation. In one you have the Prime Mini&s;ter de&s;troyed at once, on his Ma&s;ter's Letter; the World agrees in an Opinion, <HI>Sejanus</HI> was guilty, but Ju&s;tice would expect &s;ome Proof of it: <HI>Tiberuis</HI> had too loyal a Senate to wait for any Evidence: their Tyrant &s;ignified his Plea&s;ure; and that &s;erved for Demon&s;tra|tion to <HI>that very Senate</HI> which had voted Statues to <HI>that very Prime Mini&s;ter.</HI> The other Scene is the merry one, where they take into Con&s;ideration the over-grown <HI>Turbet:</HI> Nothing can be more fanta&s;tick than the blind Haranguer making a florid Speech in Prai&s;e of it, and unfortunately turning his Face from it to the contrary Side of the Room, in order to point out and de&s;cant upon its Beauties.

<P>YOU rightly ob&s;erve, that this hot|headed Prie&s;t has co&s;t both Hou&s;es more Time and Trouble than his Head is worth. What matters it if he has been too peremptory in the Pulpit, on a Subject he might better have let alone. Some Parts of his Sermons are little better than Non|&s;en&s;e, but the general Doctrine may be &s;up|ported by the Authority of all our mo&s;t eminent Divines, and corre&s;ponds with that Maxim in Law, that <HI>the King can do no Wrong.</HI></P>
<P>I think the Doctor and his Pro&s;ecutors have &s;plit on the &s;ame Rock; an extraor|dinary Ca&s;e, like the Revolution, is quite out of the ordinary Rules of Law, and not defined among the general Learning of the Ca&s;ui&s;ts concerning the Obedience of Subjects to their Soveraign. The Doc|tor ought not to have drawn the Revolu|tion into the Debate, nor ought we to fan|cy, that the Maxims of the Laws of God,
<PB N="78" REF="85">
of Nature, and of the Land, are changed by that extraordinary Occa&s;ion and Event. Tho' I am per&s;uaded the &s;ame Tenet has been taught ever &s;ince our Reformation, yet this Gentleman's Manner of teaching it is indi&s;creet; and his Warmth has been &s;ingular &s;everal Years ago. <HI>Defoe,</HI> in his <HI>Hymn to the Pillory,</HI> has long &s;ince ju&s;tly celebrated the Doctor's intemperate Zeal again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters; (I think <HI>Defoe</HI> had been then exalted for writing <HI>The &s;horte&s;t Way with the Di&s;&s;enters</HI>) He wi&s;hes, that all who merit equal Puni&s;hment might &s;tand there along with him; and then de|&s;cending to Particulars, &s;ays he,<Q><L>There wou'd the fam'd <HI>Sachev'rel</HI> &s;tand,</L>

<L>He from a <HI>Church-of-England</HI> Pulpit fir&s;t,</L>
<L>All his Di&s;&s;enting Brethren cur&s;t,</L>
<L>Doom'd them to Satan, for a Prey,</L>
<L>And fir&s;t found out <HI>The &s;horte&s;t Way.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>But the Con&s;equence of this mighty Eclat is, that mo&s;t People are apt to con|&s;ider a Sentence again&s;t this Preacher, (not as a Condemnation of this Temerity by in&s;tancing the Revolution upon an impro|per Occa&s;ion, and of his unwarrantable pronouncing Damnation again&s;t the Di&s;&s;en|ters,
<PB N="79" REF="86">
but) as an E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Di&s;|cretionary Re&s;i&s;tance of the Subject, and as a Degradation of Kingly Power in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> to the Condition of the Con&s;ular in <HI>Rome,</HI> controled by the Senate, Tribunes, and People; and all this, by a &s;olemn Judgement of the Lords, at the Demand of the Commons.</P>
<P>Our Political Penmen, who &s;warm in every Age, will not fail hereafter to magni|fy every Mi&s;take, every Slip, in every Ad|mini&s;tration; and even to call Virtue, Vice; Sweet, Bitter; and Good, Evil. <HI>Al|gernon Sidney</HI>'s Treati&s;e of Government will pa&s;s upon many for the Law of the Land; and tho&s;e who approve mo&s;t of the Revolution, may live to &s;ee this latitudinarian Allegiance (which the mi&s;guided People will be apt to learn) become trouble&s;ome under the be&s;t Princes.</P>
<P>I &s;hould think therefore this Pro&s;ecution cannot have been a very agreeable Entertain|ment to the Queen, nor a plea&s;ing Specula|tion to tho&s;e who are in the Cour&s;e of Suc|ce&s;&s;ion to the Crown.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Conver&s;ation runs as low with us in Town as you de&s;cribe it in the Country. You can hardly find a ra|tional Creature to talk to, or a rational Topic to talk upon.

<P>The Poet's Partiality, in Favour of the Doctor, is as extravagant, as his Appre|hen&s;ion of the Danger of burning the Bi|ble.

<P>IT is not doubted that this Treaty will end in Peace, in Spite of all Oppo&s;ers.

The inferior Officers make a great Clamour again&s;t it in Coffee-hou&s;es and other Places of publick Re&s;ort, and if you will take their Words, they &s;peak the Sen&s;e of the Na|tion; but do not you believe a Word of that.</P>
<P>The Emperor perhaps fancies that it is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to rai&s;e the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> on the Ruins of that of <HI>Bourbon</HI> and of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> together;

the <HI>Dutch</HI> can never be tired of having the Sub&s;i&s;tence Money of our Great Land Ar|my circulate in their Country; and the little Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> can afford to hire out Troops to us a good while longer, if we can find Ca&s;h to pay for them; this is a trade among them.

<P>But <HI>England</HI> &s;eems, as well as <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> to have occa&s;ion for a Peace, and for &s;ome of the &s;ame Rea&s;ons. We have not been beaten often, it is true; we have gotten great Victories, yet &s;till we are Sufferers, and mu&s;t be &s;o, as the Scene has been laid. What we conquer in <HI>Flanders</HI> is to be divided between the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> is al&s;o to be conquered for the latter.

This is, <HI>ne mori|are mori,</HI> with a Witne&s;s. Nay it is wor&s;e, it is giving boot, where the Exchange at even hand would be a bad Bargain; it is

paying our Blood and Trea&s;ure to &s;et <HI>Charles</HI> on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Throne, when we can leave <HI>Philip</HI> there without farther Ex|pence; and when, of the two, it is rather our Intere&s;t that <HI>Philip</HI> &s;hould fill it; and the be&s;t of the Je&s;t is, that not one of them pretends to &s;hew how <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is to be reimbur&s;ed a &s;ingle Stiver, whatever her Expence has been, or may be hereafter.

<P>It is to be hoped that the Outcry in Cof|fee-Hou&s;es of Red Coats, who have the Fear of Breaking before their Eyes, may be &s;light|ed; that tho&s;e who have made a Trade of War, either abroad or at Home, may have no Influence upon our Councils; that our Mini&s;ters will &s;it down to treat in Temper, and not in Spite, thar they will rather imi|tate <HI>Martin</HI>'s Behaviour in the <HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> than his Brother <HI>Jack</HI>'s.

As for any Fortre&s;s, as <HI>Dunkirk, Gibraltar</HI> or any other that may annoy our Traffick, it would be convenient to reduce them to the Con|dition of <HI>Tangiers,</HI> but not to think of hold|ing them.</P>
<P>I am &s;trangely fond of tho&s;e <HI>American</HI> I&s;lands, and think I can ju&s;tify my Notion by a &s;hort Ob&s;ervation upon a well known Piece of Hi&s;tory. I frequently recollect that <HI>Jamacia</HI> was taken by mere Accident: <HI>Oliver</HI> had formed a much greater De|&s;ign, which mi&s;carried; and when only <HI>Jamacia</HI> was the Prize, his Commanders were called to a &s;evere Account. He was al&s;o Ma&s;ter of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second of <HI>Tangier,</HI> in Dowry with his Queen. The&s;e were mon&s;trou&s;ly expen|&s;ive, &s;o as not to be tenable. The People grumbled that the Crown did not keep
<PB N="85" REF="92">
them; but as long as they were kept, they grumbled al&s;o at the great Expence of main|taining them. The&s;e are gone for ever from <HI>England,</HI> while the poor de&s;picable I&s;land of <HI>Jamacia</HI> has grown a flouri&s;hing Colony, is become an inexhau&s;tible Fund of Wealth to us, and occa&s;ions the con&s;tant Employment of a con&s;iderable Fleet of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Merchants.</P>
<P>The Dominion of the Seas is what we are able to maintain, it maintains it&s;elf: The more we have of it, the le&s;s Danger we are in of being invaded in it by the en|vying World confederated again&s;t us. It is one of the cleare&s;t Demon&s;trations, it is Vulgar Arithmetick; that if we carry a Million of Tuns of Goods each Year a thou&s;ands Leagues, and our Neighbour carries but the tenth Part of that Quantity the like Voyage; we &s;hall maintain ten|fold his Shipping, tenfold his Seamen, and in Con&s;equence be able to meet ten &s;uch Neighbours as Enemies, at once, upon the Watry Plain.</P>
<P>If our I&s;land-Colonies were very con&s;i|derable in Number and Value, we &s;hould find this great Convenience, that they would require no Gari&s;ons, becau&s;e no Armament could appear upon the Seas, &s;ufficient to di&s;turb them: Nor ought we to oppre&s;s them, nor &s;uffer them to be op|pre&s;&s;ed

rapacious Governors. But while our Neighbours are &s;tronger in tho&s;e Parts than we are, both We are, and the Colonies mu&s;t be burthened with the Expence of an armed Force both by Sea and Land for their Security. Were they ever &s;o populous, had they as many People among them as their Mother Country contains; there would be no Danger of their Defection, while we gave them no Cau&s;e to mourn the Want of Liberty. Their Trade would all pa&s;s thro' our Hands, protected by our Fleets, while they lived at Ea&s;e, and in as perfect Obedience as the &s;everal Pari&s;hes of <HI>Middle&s;ex.</HI></P>

<P>YOUR Complaint is very ju&s;t, that by the Titles of Impeachments in Parlia|ment, a Man at a Di&s;tance off cannot gue&s;s what the Accu&s;ation is. This again&s;t the Earl of <HI>M**</HI> con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of two Branches; one, that he &s;old the Offices of the Ma|&s;ters in Chancery for very great Sums of Money; which Offices are in &s;ome Degree judicial; the Sale of them therefore mu&s;t naturally introduce Corruption in the Offi|cers, according to the Adage, He that buys Ju&s;tice, mu&s;t &s;ell Ju&s;tice, The other Branch is, that to conceal this Sin, (as it commonly happens) he fell into a greater: Large Sums of Money, belonging chiefly to Orphans, had by the Authority of the Court been depo&s;ited in the Hands of the&s;e Ma&s;ters; &s;ome of them thought it a proper Opportunity to grow rich, nor &s;crupled to adventure the Fortunes of their Neighbours: they met with woeful Di&s;appointments of their Expectations;
<PB N="90" REF="97">
there were great Deficiencies, and the Chan|cellor, to &s;creen them, was guilty of &s;hame|ful Delays of Ju&s;tice, by putting off the Hear|ing of the Cau&s;es affected by the&s;e Lo&s;&s;es</P>
<P>To the Wonder of the gazing World, and maugre the zealous Endeavours of &s;ome mo&s;t Noble Peers, this corrupt Man is to continue a Judge, upon his Ho|nour, of the Lives and Fortunes of <HI>Engli&s;h|men;</HI> he is to continue to make our Laws, and to interpret them. He is condemned in thirty thou&s;and Pounds, it is true, but, <HI>cui bono?</HI> Not to repair the &s;uffering Sui|tors; but as a Fine to the Crown, (which perhaps may remit it) tho' the People have received the greate&s;t Injury. How then are the Sufferers to be repaired, think ye? Why, truly, it is rumoured, by a Tax to be laid on the Suitors in that Court. The innocent Suitors, who may be e&s;teemed &s;ufficiently unfortunate in having Occa&s;ion to re&s;ort thither, are to be puni&s;hed for the Iniquities of the Chancellor.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Lords is not bound by the Forms of the Courts below Stairs, and the Impeachments before them are managed pretty much in the Stile of the Civil Law; it were to be wi&s;hed, in the Ca&s;e of this Earl, they had adopted a Form of that Law which is proper to produce a ju&s;t and rational Sentence upon Crimes like
<PB N="91" REF="98">
the&s;e they have lately cen&s;ured. The Criminal Proce&s;s, among the Civilians, is frequent|ly, if not always, in the Nature of an Action <HI>Qui tam,</HI> &amp;c. I have &s;een a Libel of theirs for Homicide, which amounted to an Appeal, as well as Indictment. In a Ca&s;e like this, they would, in the fir&s;t Place, have given Relief to the Injured out of his E&s;tate, and then have made a rea&s;on|able Confi&s;cation to the Prince, as a Puni&s;h|ment of his Crimes. Thus they would have fulfilled the Dictates both of Com|mutative and Di&s;tributive Ju&s;tice. Re&s;ti|tion, was barely a Debt, and Confi&s;cation was a moderate Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>If a Sentence of Sir <HI>George Oxenden</HI>'s, who opened this Impeachment, had been duly weighed, we &s;hould hardly &s;ee the Innocent taxed for the Crimes of the &s;ol|vent Guilty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Clo&s;e of the XVIth Letter.</NOTE> But we have never been fond of changing our Laws, no not even for the better; the Lords in Parliament, four hundred Years ago, to reject a mi&s;|chievous Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Propo&s;al, an&s;wered, <HI>Nolumus leges Angliae mutari.</HI> An an&s;wer highly laudable on that Occa&s;ion! and ever &s;ince we have it trumped up to us, as a Maxim, without the lea&s;t Attention to the Difference of the Matters in Que&s;tion. I will mention to you Two &s;trong In&s;tances (in&s;tead of twenty) of our &s;upine Neglect
<PB N="92" REF="99">
in amending our Laws. The Landlord from all Antiquity might di&s;train his Tenant for Rent due, and then the Di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t peri&s;h in his Hands, if the Tenant could not pay; for the Lord could not &s;ell it, till enabled by a Statute made in the Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. This Piece of Common Law we &s;ent to <HI>Ireland,</HI> but they found the Reme|dy one hundred and fifty Years earlier than we did. Another In&s;tance is, that the then Statute of Admini&s;trations (which is but a Tran&s;lation from the one hundred and eigh|teenth Novel) was made in the latter End of the &s;ame Reign, and no earlier; and we are &s;ure that our Law was a regular and flouri&s;hing Profe&s;&s;ion four hundred Years without it. Perhaps it flouri&s;hed the more, for differing in many Points from common Sen&s;e.</P>

<P>THERE is one of the Wonders of the World to be accompli&s;hed this Se&s;&s;ion; the Salt Tax will be aboli&s;hed. It is a new Thing for the Crown to lo&s;e Ground in the Revenue. Our Hi&s;tory &s;hews very few In&s;tances of the kind. Tho' the
<PB N="93" REF="100">
Occa&s;ion was mo&s;t urgent when the Tax was impo&s;ed, and tho' the Grant of it was only temporary, and for a very &s;hort Time too, yet Pretences have been always found to continue the Burthen, when the Nece&s;|&s;ity cea&s;ed. Our Oracle in the Law and Records of Parliament ob&s;erves, that Ton|nage and Poundage were granted fir&s;t to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth, to enable Him to invade and conquer <HI>France;</HI> but his unfortunate Son, who lo&s;t that Acqui&s;ition back again, enjoyed the &s;ame Revenue, as did al&s;o Queen <HI>Mary</HI> the Fir&s;t, who lo&s;t <HI>Calais,</HI> the only Fragment of it that re|mained till her Time. So forcible is a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the Crown, that People are apt to &s;uffer it to turn to a Right. But this Mi&s;take co&s;t King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t dear; it was the Fir&s;t Grievance of his Reign and di&s;po&s;ed a knowing, a re&s;olute Gene|ration of Freeman (who&s;e Spirits were not broken by Taxes and Standing Armies) to examine every thing with Rigour. Yet not all the Difficulties and Mi&s;|fortunes of his Reign could deter his Son, King <HI>James</HI> the Second (tho' he did not want the Money) from levying the &s;ame Re|venue before it was given by Parliament. I think we have one In&s;tance in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, of the Monarch's taking le&s;s than the Subject gave, and that was in the Days
<PB N="94" REF="101">
of Good Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who cho&s;e to reign in the Hearts of her People, who de|pre&s;&s;ed Monopolies, and particular Schemes of robbing the Publick, and e&s;teemed the Wealth and Honour of the Nation as her own.</P>
<P>If Farmers in their Tillage and their Diet, Merchants in Victualling their Ships, Potters in their Manufacture, but above all, the Fi&s;hery (that <HI>Diu multumque de&s;i|deratum</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI>) require &s;uch immen&s;e Quantities of Salt, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to maintain the Officers, and to make any con&s;iderable Profit of that Re|venue, if we allow Draw-backs for all tho&s;e Purpo&s;es (not to &s;peak of the frequent Frauds upon Exportation) and as on the other Hand, we would not have our Neigh|bours Till their Land, Navigate their Ships, Cure their Fi&s;h, and even be able to &s;ell an earthen Pitcher cheaper than we can; it is really amazing to con&s;ider how this Tax came fir&s;t to be granted in this Nation; but it is much more a&s;toni&s;hing that the Expe|rience of its Michiefs had not long ago awa|kened the Legi&s;lature to redeem it. It is not &s;trange that the People &s;hould gladly em|brace the Opportunity of Deliverance from this Oppre&s;&s;ion; the Miracle is, that a Fir&s;t Mini&s;ter &s;hould give his Voice for &s;o con&s;iderable a Reduction of his
<PB N="95" REF="102">
Myrmidons, &s;hould concur in aboli&s;hing a Tax which &s;eems calculated to create Mini|&s;terial Dependencies, and to corrupt Voices for Parliamentary Elections. Perhaps, like <HI>Sylla,</HI> he knows he has &s;o well convinced the World of his tran&s;cendent Ability for Mi&s;chief, that he may retire in Safety with the Spoil of Nations, and de&s;erve the Thanks of Mankind for plaguing them no longer. But if he de&s;igns to pur&s;ue the Plan which he has hitherto proceeded on, the Trained Bands of the Salt-Duty are an ill-judged Reduction of his Forces: He does not u&s;ually commit &s;uch Blunders in Dome&s;tick Politicks, whatever his Enemies object to his Skill and Addre&s;s in Foreign Treaties. Taxes, burthen&s;ome as This is, make Standing Armies nece&s;&s;ary; and great Armies cannot be maintained without bur|then&s;ome Taxes; they are Bawd and Punk to each other, but the poor Nation is always the Cully.</P>
<P>It is a Propo&s;ition as demon&s;trable as any in <HI>Euclid,</HI> that heavy Taxes mu&s;t naturally de|&s;troy this or any other trading populous Na|tion, which depends greatly on its own Ma|nufactures. Yet neither the &s;mall Vulgar nor the Great can comprehend this Truth. If <HI>France</HI> can maintain her Manufacturer, in proper Provinces, at Ten Pounds <HI>per Ann.</HI> when ours mu&s;t co&s;t Twenty, and if the
<PB N="96" REF="103">
Value of 30 <HI>l.</HI> in Wool will employ at lea&s;t &s;ix Per&s;ons, at a Medium, <HI>per Ann.</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Account will &s;tand thus, For Wool 30 <HI>l.</HI> for Work, 120 <HI>l.</HI> Total, 150 <HI>l.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> may be &s;tated thus, For Wool, 40 <HI>l.</HI> for Work, 60 <HI>l.</HI> Total, 100 <HI>l.</HI> &s;o that the <HI>French</HI> may &s;ell Wares of equal Goodne&s;s at 100 <HI>l.</HI> which we &s;hall not be able to &s;ell under 150 <HI>l.</HI> and this upon a Suppo&s;ition too, that they pay 20<HI>l.</HI> for one third Part of their Quantity of Wool which co&s;ts us on|ly 10 <HI>l.</HI> Thus if we &s;uppo&s;e that they u&s;e two thirds of their own Growth, they can af|ford to give for what they buy from us, or from <HI>Ireland,</HI> double the Price of our Market, and yet &s;ell &s;o much cheaper than we can, as is already &s;tated.</P>
<P>Our Manufacturers make a Noi&s;e about the running of Wool, and about that only, as if this were their only Evil. They are a&s;&s;i&s;ted in their Clamour, and mi&s;led in their Rea&s;oning, by tho&s;e who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to rai&s;e a Du&s;t, and to hide the true, the principal Cau&s;e of the Declen&s;ion of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade; that is of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Grandeur. This a&s;&s;igning <HI>non cau&s;a pro cau&s;a,</HI> is (when it can pa&s;s upon People) the mo&s;t dangerous kind of Sophi&s;try; the Principle being fal&s;e, the falfe Deductions from it may be numberle&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="104">
If a Ma&s;ter Weaver, who returns Twen|ty Thou&s;and Pounds a Year in his Trade, &s;hould complain that Wool is ri&s;en Ten <HI>per Cent.</HI> by clande&s;tine Exportation, and that the Manufacturer is ruined by it; it would be in vain to tell him, that there is a &s;ingle Evil that prejudices his Manufacture in a much greater Degree: He would laugh at me, as an ignorant Pretender, to pre&s;ume to be wi&s;er than a Man in his own Trade. And yet I may venture to &s;ay, that the Duty on Soap and Candles is an heavier Clog on the Manufacture, than any probable Advance in the Price of the un|wrought Commodity can amount to. But here is the Difference, the Ma&s;ter knows when he pays an advanced Price for Wool, but he forgets that he pays the Candle-Tax in the Wages of the Workman.</P>
<P>I do not mean upon the Whole, that <HI>France</HI> will be able to cut us out from every particular Branch or Article of the Woollen Manufacture. I doubt not that we are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Manufacture of &s;ome Sorts both of Cloths and Stuffs, which they cannot equal; e&s;pecially without the Help of our Wool, or that of <HI>Ireland.</HI> But then this mu&s;t be admitted, that tho' we could totally cut of the clande&s;tine Ex|portation, yet the <HI>French</HI> would &s;till be able to increa&s;e in the Manufacture of va&s;t Quantities of coar&s;e Goods; and let us
<PB N="98" REF="105">
remember, that tho' a Yard of fine Cloth may be worth a Guinea, yet the Proportion of that Export is but &s;mall. It is the Cloath|ing of the Millions that makes Millions of Money; and if the <HI>French</HI> are to &s;upplant us in foreign Markets for the Sale of coar&s;e Goods, tho' perhaps the Fountain of our Wealth will not be quite exhau&s;ted, yet I fear it will run mi&s;erably low. It is idle to &s;ay, that their coar&s;e Manufactures will not be as good as ours, if they &s;ell at a lower Price, that will more than compen&s;ate the Difference. The Multitude do not affect the nice&s;t Goods, they are glad to be warm at a cheap Rate, and I think our Merchants have &s;aid &s;omething like this in their Com|plaints of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Trade to <HI>Lisbon.</HI> They &s;ay, that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Goods, are not com|parable to ours, but becau&s;e they can un|der&s;ell us, they have a ready Market, while ours lye un&s;old upon the Factors Hands.</P>
<P>It would be proper to apply this Com|plaint again&s;t <HI>Ireland,</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> and to <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> too; for the <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian</HI> has &s;up|planted us very lately in our Trade to <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> to the Value of many Thou&s;and Pounds a Year for coar&s;e cloathing for the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Armies. Does all this depend on the Running of Wool from home? Has the Almighty given fleecy Sheep only to <HI>Eng|land</HI> and <HI>Ireland?</HI> We may po&s;&s;ibly hinder Foreigners from getting our Wool, but what
<PB N="99" REF="106">
Act of Parliament &s;hall prevent their work|ing up their own? Why do not we make a Law to forbid their Gra&s;s to grow, and to interrupt their Sun-&s;hine?</P>
<P>Nothing but the true Foundation of the Growth of the Wealth of private Dealers, can make a trading Nation flouri&s;h. We mu&s;t &s;ell great Quantities and that cannot happen unle&s;s we &s;ell at lea&s;t as cheap as our Neighbours: It is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that we cannot effect this, while we are plunged in Debt: It is no Wonder that we are thus in Debt, &s;ince, after our devouring Land War, we continue to &s;upport a great Army at home and abroad ever &s;ince; and that by Taxes which were half devoured by tho&s;e who collected them. It is natural for People to flock out of the Mortgaged-Kingdom to <HI>America, France</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> or any other Place where their Indu&s;try may feed and cloath them, which it can|not at home: And thus (ju&s;t as it happens in the Ca&s;e of private Per&s;ons) the Increa&s;e of the Nation's Debt occa&s;ions the Decrea&s;e of the Means of paying it. The Lo&s;s of the Nation by maintaining a great Army, is not yet &s;ufficiently &s;tated, be&s;ides the po&s;i|tive Lo&s;s of paying them, there is al&s;o a negative Lo&s;s of at lea&s;t Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per Ann.</HI> which they would and ought to get, if they were left to labour for their Sub&s;i&s;tence.</P>

<HEAD>LETTERS OF Bi&s;hop <HI>FLEETWOOD,</HI> Containing, His Sentiments of the PROCEEDINGS of the NEW MINISTRY during the La&s;t Four Years Reign of Queen <HI>ANNE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_WHEN that unhappy Change was made in the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Mea&s;ures, 1710, which bla&s;ted all the Glo|ries and Triumphs of the Eight preceding Years, this good Bi&s;hop, who was a &s;teady Friend to the <HI>Old Mini&s;try,</HI> be|cau&s;e he &s;aw they had &s;erved their Coun|try well and faithfully, could not be drawn to give any Countenance to the Mea&s;ures of the <HI>New One,</HI> tho' Endeavours had been u&s;ed, and Intimations given by the Queen her&s;elf, who had a great Value for him, how plea&s;ing his frequent coming to Court would be to her.

<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received the Favour of your Lord&s;hip's Letter, and took it, as I know it was intended, very kindly. The Manner of my receiving the Indignity put upon my Pre|face, was neither like a Chri&s;tian nor Phi|lo&s;opher, but like a very worldly Man.

I am not one that love to be the Talk of the Town, and in this Part I con|fe&s;s I was unea&s;y, although I think the Talk was very much in my Favour. The Complaint was <HI>made</HI> by <HI>Hungerford,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;neering, trifling, Wrangler, and much more noted, at the Bar, for Noi&s;e and Clamour, than a Knowledge of the Laws of his Country.</NOTE> and <HI>&s;econded</HI> by <HI>Manley,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A Tool of <HI>Hungerford</HI>'s, par Nobile Fratrum.</NOTE> (<HI>People</HI> that &s;hould indeed have been ordered to have burnt it) and <HI>thirded</HI> by what we call the <HI>Court,</HI> and carried by Numbers without a wi&s;e Word &s;aid again&s;t it. Sir <HI>Peter King,</HI> Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Jekyll,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lechmere,</HI> and others of the Robe, were very &s;trenuous Advocates in its Behalf, and &s;o were other Gentlemen, but to no great Purpo&s;e, for the <HI>Court</HI> divided 119, and my Friends but 54. If their De&s;ign was to intimi|date me, they have lo&s;t it utterly; or, if to &s;uppre&s;s the Book, it happens much otherwi&s;e, for every Body's Curio&s;ity is awakened by this &V;&s;age, and the Book&s;eller finds his Account in it, above any one el&s;e. The <HI>Spectator</HI> has conveyed above 14,000 of them into other People's Hands, that would otherwi&s;e have never &s;een or heard of it. In a word, <HI>My Lord,</HI> when I con&s;ider that the&s;e Gentlemen have u&s;ed me no wor&s;e,

But Plea|&s;antry apart, my Heart is wounded within me, when I con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly whereabouts we are, and whither we are tending. The Court-Party do now own publickly, that except the Allies accept of the Conditions that are offered them, King <HI>Philip</HI> is not to make any <HI>Renunciation;</HI> and certainly the Allies cannot accept of tho&s;e Condi|tions, unle&s;s they are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to the la&s;t Degree.

It is now &s;aid, that <HI>England</HI> is to con&s;train the King of <HI>France</HI> to content the <HI>States</HI> with a Barrier to their liking, and that the re&s;t will come in, or &s;tand out without any Danger; but I am afraid <HI>England</HI> has lo&s;t all her con|&s;training Power, and that <HI>France</HI> thinks &s;he has us in her Hands, and may u&s;e us as

&s;he plea&s;es, which I dare &s;ay, will be as &s;curvily as we de&s;erve. What a Change has Two Years made? Your Lord&s;hip may now imagine you are growing young again, for we are fallen, methinks, into the very Dregs of <HI>Charles the Second</HI>'s Politicks; &s;aving, that then they were more rea&s;on|able, becau&s;e our Enemy was then in &s;o full Power and Lu&s;tre, as might both ter|rify and dazzle a poor luxurious Prince, who would not be di&s;turbed, nor &s;eemed to care much what became of <HI>England</HI> after he was gone. The pre&s;ent Times may put you in Mind of tho&s;e, with this bad Dif|ference &s;till, that now the ruinous Effects of tho&s;e Advices &s;eem to be taking Place after an Interval of five, or &s;ix, and twenty Years; and after &s;uch an Interruption, as one would have thought &s;hould have quite baffled and de&s;troyed them. I find, <HI>My Lord,</HI> upon reading my Letter, that I have entred upon deep Matters, which, con&s;ider|ing the Times, and the <HI>Sp&acirc;</HI> Waters I have taken, I ought not to have done. You will, I hope, excu&s;e me, for methought I was talking with you, who, I believe favour me.

<P>WHEN a Friend, who is your near Neighbour, informed me of your Return to <HI>Paris,</HI> I re&s;olved to &s;ee you, as &s;oon as I found my&s;elf able to &s;tir abroad. The Gout obliged me to defer that Happine&s;s for &s;ome Time; and when at length I hoped to enjoy it, it was my Misfortune that you was not at home. It remains therefore that I perform by Letter, what I could not do by Word of Mouth; and that I give you hearty Thanks for the many Favours you have conferred on me, of which I &s;hall always retain a grateful Remembrance.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="123">
Tho&s;e Pre&s;ents of the Books which you have publi&s;hed of late Years, are to me very valuable, and do me abundance of Honour; for, mo&s;t worthy Sir, I greatly e&s;teem you, and every Thing of yours. Every thing you write in that Kind of Learn|ing, is finely fini&s;hed; and I not only pre|fer you before all other Writers in that Way, but e&s;teem you as the mo&s;t perfect Ma&s;ter both of Style and Sentiment: And tho' I have &s;pent &s;ome little Time and Pains my&s;elf in Pur&s;uit of this very Study, yet I freely own, that when I read your Works over and over, I learn not only tho&s;e Things from you which I did not know, but al&s;o many Things which I thought I had been Ma&s;ter of before. Therefore you &s;peak too mode&s;tly of your Per&s;orm|ance, when you &s;ay it is only calculated for the In&s;truction of Youth. Men who are well acquainted with this Branch of Learning, may certainly read your Writ|ings with Plea&s;ure, and with Profit. You revive indeed to our Memories Facts that are ancient and well known, but in revive|ing them, you illu&s;trate and adorn them; to the Old you add &s;omething New; to the Works of Others, &s;omething that is intire|ly your Own; and by placing good Pictures in a good Light, you bring it to pa&s;s, that they give greater Plea&s;ure, and appear more
<PB N="117" REF="124">
beautiful than ever, even to tho&s;e who have often &s;een them before.</P>
<P>As you frequently turn over <HI>Xenophon,</HI> you clearly &s;eem to have borrowed from him both the Matter which you relate in many Places, and the manner of relating it, and you have not only imitated, but have manife&s;tly acquired the Per&s;picuity and neat Simplicity of his Style: So that, if <HI>Xenophon</HI> had under&s;tood <HI>French,</HI> I am of Opinion he would have written in no other Words or Manner than you have done upon the &s;ame Subject.</P>
<P>I &s;ay not the&s;e Things to flatter (a Vice I am not at all liable to) but from my real Sentiments; and as you have inriched me with the choice&s;t Gifts, to which I know my&s;elf unable to make a &s;uitable Return, in the &s;ame, or any other, Kind of Learn|ing, I was at lea&s;t de&s;irous to &s;hew a willing and grateful Mind to you, and to make you &s;ome &s;mall Pre&s;ent,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Bi&s;hop &s;ent Him his Sermons.</NOTE> tho' very unlike what I had received.

<PB N="128" REF="135">
Talents, that he de&s;erves all manner of Prai&s;e; &s;o high in Fame and Reputation, that he &s;tands in need of none; a Per&s;on &s;o exactly &s;uiting the Plan and Character which our Ance&s;tors laid down for a PRO|LOCUTOR, that he may well &s;eem &s;elected from among Us to this high Dignity, not &s;o much by our VOTES, as by the Ancient Rules of CONVOCATIONS.</P>
<P>For if a Store of exqui&s;ite Learning can be of any A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Di&s;charge of this Office, who can di&s;charge it with grea|ter Applau&s;e to him&s;elf, or more Advantage to Us, than One who is well acquainted with <HI>all</HI> Parts of Literature, long and &s;uc|ce&s;sfully exerci&s;ed in <HI>mo&s;t</HI> Arts and Studies, mo&s;t accompli&s;hed and perfect in tho&s;e Sciences which admit of the greate&s;t Per|fection? If la&s;tly, it is a peculiar part of the Character of a Complete PROLOCUTOR, to expre&s;s by his &s;ingle Tongue the Senti|ments of many Eloquent Men, we have an Orator of &s;o fini&s;hed an Elegance, that You, Fathers, need not fear that his Un|skilfulne&s;s &s;hould dimini&s;h the Dignity of your An&s;wers; and we may ju&s;tly hope, that his Eloquence will add a con&s;iderable Weight and Advantage to Our Petitions. If Good-will has an Influence in reconciling Refentments, Authority a great Force in
<PB N="129" REF="136">
moderating Di&s;putes, whom we could ra|ther wi&s;h to be a Judge in our Debates, than one who&s;e gentle Di&s;po&s;ition renders him &s;o popular, that he may ju&s;tly hope by the Sweetne&s;s of his Temper to allure all who have any &s;hare of, Goodne&s;s or Hu|manity, to the Study of Peace and Unity; one, who&s;e Gravity is &s;o free from Arro|gance, that &s;hould any Commotions hap|pen to ari&s;e among us, the very Dignity of his Pre&s;ence mu&s;t immediately &s;uppre&s;s them. Little therefore, mo&s;t <HI>Sacred Fa|thers,</HI> had the Clergy an&s;wered your Ex|pectations, had they placed this weighty Burthen on any weaker Shoulders; and at the &s;ame time they had proved them&s;elves ungrateful, and forgetful of the greate&s;t Be|nefits, had they not willingly offered any Honours, that they could confer, to one who had &s;o highly de&s;erved of them. He certainly may rightfully claim the fir&s;t Place in our SYNOD, who by Divine In|citement &s;trenuou&s;ly endeavoured, by Di|vine Favour happily effected this, That SYNODS in this Nation are not altogether lo&s;t and dead, nor intirely Speechle&s;s.</P>
<P>Indulge me, <HI>Fathers,</HI> if I trace this mat|ter &s;omething higher; nothing &s;hall I &s;ay to detract from your Dignity, to which I bear the deepe&s;t and &s;incere&s;t Veneration; nothing to revive antient Differences, to which I have the utmo&s;t Abhorrence.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="137">
The Convention of the Bi&s;hops and Clergy had been now for &s;ome Years in|terrupted. The Meetings of the States in Parliament for the Management of the Af|fairs of the <HI>Common-wealth</HI> were frequent; all this time there were no Meetings of the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>their Clergy,</HI> for the Promotion of the Good of the Church. I don't &s;ay, I don't think, that this was done with an evil Intent; nay, I am apt to believe, that it proceeded from an Affection to the Church, from a pious Fear of Differences, and an ardent De&s;ire for the Pre&s;ervation of Peace: But however, many Per&s;ons, who neither wanted Hone&s;ty nor Fore&s;ight, thought that this Intermi&s;&s;ion of Convocations would one time or other prove of the great|e&s;t Di&s;advantage to the Church. They were under great Apprehen&s;ions, that what they knew was begun by the be&s;t of Princes, and with the be&s;t Advice, might by a wor&s;e <HI>Prince,</HI> who had wor&s;e De|&s;igns, be turned to the De&s;truction of the <HI>Church.</HI> In the mean time many new mon|&s;trous Doctrines are daily Publi&s;hed; ma|ny Here&s;ies diffu&s;e their poi&s;onous Princi|ples with Impunity; Reproaches and Bla&s;|phemies, &s;hameful to utter, and horrible to hear, are freely vented again&s;t the Prie&s;thood, again&s;t things Sacred, and the mo&s;t Holy Name of GOD him&s;elf. The
<PB N="131" REF="138">
Authority of a Convocation had formerly given a proper and pre&s;ent Antidote again&s;t the&s;e Plagues. All good Men implore this A&s;&s;i&s;tance; without this they think we mu&s;t utterly de&s;pair of pre&s;erving and de|fending Religion in the&s;e Nations.</P>
<P>Such was the State of Affairs, when this very Learned <HI>Per&s;on</HI> thought it pro|per to place <HI>The Rights, Powers and Privileges of an Engli&s;h Convocation</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Title of Dr. Atterbury's Book in An&s;wer to Dr. <HI>Wake</HI>'s <HI>State of the Church, and Clergy of</HI> England. <HI>fol.</HI> 1703.</NOTE> in an open and true Light, and to &s;trengthen them with all the Force they could receive from Laws and Cu&s;tom. With this View he &s;earches carefully into the Antient Mo|numents of the Church, then covered with Du&s;t and ob&s;curity, rightly thinking that the Manner and Method of Conven|ing, the Rules and Laws of holding <HI>Con|vocations,</HI> was not to be drawn from the modern Di&s;cour&s;es of Men, nor from the Memory of us, or our Fathers; but from the Commentaries of the Antients, the Edicts of Kings, and the Regi&s;ters of Popes. For this purpo&s;e he got into his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, with great Labour and Co&s;t, many loo&s;e and &s;catter'd Manu&s;cripts, al|mo&s;t obliterated by Time, which he care|fully
<PB N="132" REF="139">
read again and again. By the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the&s;e he fir&s;t ventured to tread a Way involved with Darkne&s;s, covered with Thorns, and perplexed with Intrica|cies, without any Guide to conduct him, without any Foot&s;teps of former Travellers to direct him. But he, relying on the Strength and Powers of his Genius, and inflamed with the Zeal for the Di&s;covery of Truth, unwound all the&s;e Mazes, how|ever difficult and perplexed; Things in them&s;elves ob&s;cure he brighten'd, the doubtful reduced to Certainty, and poli&s;h|ed the unornamental. He by drawing away the Veil exhibited to publick View and Ad|miration the antient Face of the <HI>Church.</HI> In his Writings we with Joy behold her very Picture drawn in proper Colours, and exactly agreeable to the true Features and Lineaments of the Original; and how will that Joy and Veneration be increa&s;ed, when we &s;hall view the Matron her&s;elf be|fore us, reviv'd as it were from the Dead, breathing, &s;peaking! Much &s;hould I in|jure one endeared to me by the &s;tricte&s;t Rules of Friend&s;hip, much e&s;teemed from frequent Trials of his Integrity, if I did not believe his frequent and &s;olemn A&s;&s;eve|rations, that he did not engage in this Great Work out of any De&s;ire of Innovations, any private Re&s;entments, or meaner Views
<PB N="133" REF="140">
of Intere&s;t, but merely for the Good and Advantage of the <HI>Church.</HI> Neither &s;hould I act the human, faithful or ju&s;t Part, did I not endeavour to fix in the Minds of others that Character and Opinion of Him, which is intirely rooted in my own; and which I did not ra&s;hly take up from &s;light Conjectures, but from an intimare Ac|quaintance and long Experience. This Recommendation would be too invidious, and more unea&s;y to Him than any one be|&s;ides, &s;hould I &s;ay that he never err'd, ne|ver was mi&s;taken in &s;o long a Work, never let &s;ome Words in the Heat of his Pen pa&s;s from him, which he would not will|ingly have recalled upon cooler Reflect|ions. Should I &s;ay that he has not often nor gro&s;ly err'd, nor willingly drawn others into Mi&s;takes; &s;hould I po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert that there are many Things in the&s;e Writings that merit the highe&s;t Prai&s;e, few that want any Allowances of Excu&s;e, none but what Men of Humanity might ea&s;ily pardon; I &s;hould in that utter my own Opinion, and, if I am not deceived by too great a Fondne&s;s of Friend&s;hip, the Opinion of all impartial Judges too. Be there then room left for Pardon, for Prai&s;e, for Gratitude. If &s;ome &s;harp, warm or free Expre&s;&s;ions have e&s;caped him, a Rea|der of any Humanity will not attribute
<PB N="134" REF="141">
them to Envy, Re&s;entment, or Arrogance, but to a Temper of it&s;elf too warm, or perhaps to Pa&s;&s;ion ea&s;ily pardonable in a Soldier who contended for all that is dear to Us, in a Son endeavouring to re&s;cue his Mother from Injury and Violence. But if there is an Overballance of Beauties in his Writings, if he has treated of things in them&s;elves difficult, u&s;eful, plea&s;ing; if he has confirmed them by the &s;tronge&s;t Ar|guments, if he has imprinted them in the Minds of the Readers by a Purity and Per&s;picuity of Stile, it is fit that he receive the Applau&s;e due to Learning from Men of Letters, from the Eloquent the Honour due to Eloquence. If he has bravely a&s;&s;ert|ed the Privileges and Liberties of CONVO|CATIONS at the Hazard of his own Fortune, if he has preferr'd the publick Advantage to his private Intere&s;t, let the CLERGY make &s;ome Returns at lea&s;t, to the A&s;&s;ertor of <HI>The Rights of the Clergy.</HI> May this Man of equal Penetration and Diligence in the Management of Bu&s;ine&s;s, receive this mo&s;t proper Reward of his Services, the Op|portunity of acting in a larger Sphere, where he may exert all his Powers of Arts and Genius, in contriving, promoting, and confirming <HI>the Peace of the Church.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN ORATION, IN DEFENCE OF THE NEW Philo&s;ophy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tran&s;lated by <HI>Richard Rawlin&s;on,</HI> L.L.D. and F.R.S. of St. <HI>John</HI>'s Coll. <HI>Oxon.</HI></NOTE></HEAD>
<P>GENTLEMEN of the <HI>&V;niver&s;ity,</HI> how long, &s;hall we &s;lavi&s;hly tread in the Steps of the Antients, and be afraid of being wi&s;er than our Ance&s;tors? How long &s;hall we religiou&s;ly wor&s;hip the Tri|flings of Antiquity, as &s;ome do Old Wives Stories? It is indeed &s;hameful, when we &s;urvey the great Ornament of the pre&s;ent Age,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI></NOTE> to transfer our Applau&s;es to the Ancients, and to take Pains to &s;earch into Ages pa&s;t for Per&s;ons de&s;erving of Pane|gyric.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="150">
The antient Philo&s;ophy has had more allowed, than it could re&s;onably pretend to. How often has SHELDON's Theatre rung with Encomia on the <HI>Stagyrite,</HI> Who, greater than his own <HI>Alexander,</HI> has long, un-oppo&s;ed, triumphed in our School-Desks, and had the whole World for his Pupils. At length aro&s;e CARTESIUS, a happier Geni|us, who has bravely a&s;&s;erted the Truth again&s;t the united Force of all Oppo&s;ers, and has brought on the Stage a new Me|thod of Philo&s;ophizing. But &s;hall we &s;tig|matize with the Name of Novelty that Philo&s;ophy, which, tho' but lately re|vived, is more antient than the <HI>Peripate|tic,</HI> and as Old as the Matter from whence it is derived. A great Man indeed He was, and the only one we envy FRANCE. He &s;olved the Difficulties of the Univer&s;e al|mo&s;t as well as if he had been its Archi|tect. He de&s;troyed tho&s;e Orbs of Gla&s;s, which the Whims of Antiquity had fixed above, brought to light that Troop of Forms till then unknown, and has almo&s;t extingui&s;hed the Element of Fire; nay, he with &s;o much Clearne&s;s traced out the whole Ma&s;s of Matter, as to leave no Oc|cult Quality untouched. This Philo&s;opher &s;corned to be any longer bounded within the Streights and Chry&s;talline Walls of an <HI>Ari&s;totelic</HI> World; No, his Delight is to
<PB N="144" REF="151">
&s;earch the Regions above, to di&s;cover new Suns, and new Worlds, which lay hid among&s;t the Stars; his Satisfaction is to view that large Kingdom of Air amid&s;t the unfixed Stars, and Lands that pa&s;s the Milky-Way, and more accurately mea&s;ure this va&s;t Machine, a Machine fit for Man|kind to philo&s;ophize on, and worthy of the Deity, who fir&s;t framed it.</P>
<P>Here we have not only New Heavens opened to us, but we look down on our Earth; this Philo&s;ophy affords us &s;everal Kinds of Animals, where, by the Help of the Micro&s;cope, our Eyes are &s;o far a&s;|&s;i&s;ted, that we may di&s;cern the Produc|tions of the &s;malle&s;t Creatures, while we con&s;ider with a curious Eye the animat|ed Particles of Matter, and behold with A&s;toni&s;hment the reptile Mountains of living Atoms. Thus are our Eyes become more penetrating by modern Helps; and even that Work, which Nature boa&s;ts for her Ma&s;ter-Piece, is rendered more correct and fini&s;hed. We no longer pay a blind Veneration to that barbarous <HI>Peripatetic</HI> Jingle, tho&s;e ob&s;cure Schola&s;tic Terms of Art, once held as Oracles, but con&s;ult the Dictates of our own Sen&s;es, and by late invented Engines force Nature her&s;elf to di&s;cover plainly her mo&s;t valued Secrets, her mo&s;t hidden Rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="152">
By the Help of In&s;truments like the&s;e, that Air, which a bountiful Nature has in|dulged us, we, as often as we plea&s;e, by the Force of Art, abridge other Animals of, and keep them in our Pneumatick Pumps, from its common Benefit: What a Plea|&s;ure is it to &s;ee the fruitle&s;s Heavings of the Lights, to exhau&s;t their Lives, and by a mo&s;t artful Sort of Theft rob them of their Breath? From this nothing is &s;afe, nothing &s;o long lived, which gradually does not langui&s;h, and fall dead without a Wound. A divine Piece of Art this, and worthy its Author,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Honourable <HI>Robert Boyle</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></NOTE> who in the Conduct of his Life, and the Force of his Arguments, has &s;o nobly honoured our Nation, and the new Philo&s;ophy, one who for this Rea&s;on too de&s;erves never to want the Be|nefit of his own Air, or that he, who has &s;o often deprived other Animals of their Life, &s;hould ever breathe out his own.</P>
<P>On no &s;uch Grounds as the&s;e has ARIS|TOTLE built his Philo&s;ophy, who from his own Brain furni&s;hed out all his Rules of Arts and Sciences, and left nothing un|touched on, nothing unregarded but <HI>Truth.</HI> If therefore he precipitated him&s;elf into the River <HI>Euripus,</HI> becau&s;e he could not under&s;tand its Ebb and Flow, by the &s;ame
<PB N="146" REF="153">
Logick he might at his fir&s;t Entrance on Philo&s;ophy have de&s;troyed him&s;elf, and we may fairly doubt, in which of the Elements he ought to have peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>After ARISTOTLE's Fate amid&s;t the Waves of <HI>Euripus,</HI> a new Race of <HI>Peripateticks</HI> &s;tarted up, even wor&s;e than their Founder, who handed their Philo&s;ophy to After-Ages in &s;o thick an Ob&s;curity, that it has pre&s;erved it from the Satire and Ridicule of all Man|kind, as under&s;tood by very few. Some there are to be found, who &s;pend their Time amid&s;t the Rubbi&s;h which the&s;e Commentators have filled the World with, and pore more than once on the&s;e god-like Trea&s;ures of Learning, and &s;tick to them to no other Purpo&s;e, unle&s;s to &s;hew the World the va&s;t Pains they take to be deceived. Can there be a more plea&s;ant Sight than to &s;ee the&s;e wi&s;e Champions wrangling with each other? The one, armed with Propo&s;itions and Syllogi&s;ms, attacks his Antagoni&s;t in the &s;ame Armour: Both Bell-weathers grow angry, and &s;torm, fond of a Victory, which is worth but a Trifle, when ob|tained: Each, with all his Might darts out his Barbari&s;ms at the other, they en|tangle them&s;elves in their Follies, and as neither knows how to extricate him&s;elf, they &s;ound to a Retreat, and when all the
<PB N="147" REF="154">
Ammunition is &s;pent on both Sides, they think fit to keep Silence.</P>
<P>Thus far, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> and no farther launches out the antient Philo&s;ophy: Let us therefore &s;entence for ever this Troop of Commentators, to be tied up in Chains and Libraries, Food only for Moths and Worms, and there let them quietly grow Old, free from the Sight of any Reader.</P>

<P>YOUR Grace's Di&s;plea&s;ure, and my Im|pri&s;onment, are Things &s;o &s;trange unto me, as what to Write, or to what to Excu&s;e, I am altogether ignorant. Whereas you &s;end unto me (willing me to confe&s;s a Truth, and &s;o obtain your Favour) by &s;uch an one whom you know to be mine antient profe&s;&s;ed Enemy; I no &s;ooner received this Me&s;&s;age by him, than I rightly conceived your Meaning; and if, as you &s;ay, confe&s;&s;ing a Truth indeed may procure my Safety, I &s;hall with all Willing|ne&s;s and Duty perform your Command.</P>
<P>But let not your Grace ever imagine that your poor Wife will ever be brought to ac|knowledge a Fault, where not &s;o much as a Thought thereof preceded. And to &s;peak a Truth, never Prince had Wife more Loyal in all Duty, and in all true Affection, than you have ever found in <HI>Anne Boleyn,</HI> with which Name and Place I could willingly have con|tented
<PB N="23" REF="197">
my &s;elf, if God, and your Grace's Plea&s;ure had been &s;o plea&s;ed. Neither did I at any Time &s;o far forget my &s;elf in my Exalta|tion, or received Queen&s;hip, but that I al|ways looked for &s;uch an Alteration as now I find; for the Ground of my Preferment be|ing on no &s;urer Foundation than you Grace's Fancy, the lea&s;t Alteration, I knew, was fit and &s;ufficient to draw that Fancy to &s;ome other Subject. You have cho&s;en me, from a low E&s;tate, to be your Queen and Compa|nion, far beyond my De&s;ert or De&s;ire. If then you found me worthy of &s;uch Honour, Good your Grace let not any light Fancy, or bad Councel of mine Enemies, withdraw your Princely Favour from me; neither let that Stain, that unworthy Stain of a Di&s;loyal Heart towards your good Grace, ever ca&s;t &s;o &s;oul a Blot on your mo&s;t Dutiful Wife, and the Infant Prince&s;s your Daughter: Try me good King, but let me have a Lawful Trial, and let not my &s;worn Enemies &s;it as my Ac|cu&s;ers and Judges; yea, let me receive an open Trial, for my Truth &s;hall fear no open Shame; then &s;hall you &s;ee, either mine In|nocency cleared, your Su&s;picion and Con&s;ci|ence &s;atisfied, the Ignominy and Slander of the World &s;topped, or my Guilt openly de|clared. So that what&s;oever God or You may determine of me, your Grace may be freed from an open Cen&s;ure; and mine Offences being &s;o lawfully proved, your Grace is at
<PB N="24" REF="198">
liberty, both before God and Man, not only to execute worthy Puni&s;hment on me as an unlawful Wife, but to follow your Affection already &s;ettled on that Party, for who&s;e Sake I am now as I am, who&s;e Name I could &s;ome good While &s;ince have pointed unto: Your Grace being not ignorant of my Su&s;|picion therein.</P>
<P>But if you have already determined of me, and that not only my Death, but an infa|mous Slander mu&s;t bring you the enjoying of your de&s;ired Happine&s;s; then I de&s;ire of God, that he will pardon your great Sin therein, and likewi&s;e mine Enemies, the In&s;truments thereof; and that he will not call you to a &s;trict Account for your unprincely and cruel U&s;age of me, at his General Judgment-Seat, where both You and My&s;elf mu&s;t &s;hortly ap|pear, and in who&s;e Judgment, I doubt not, (what&s;oever the World may think of me) mine Innocence &s;hall be openly known, and &s;ufficiently cleared.</P>
<P>My la&s;t and only Reque&s;t &s;hall be, That my &s;elf may only bear the Burthen of your Grace's Di&s;plea&s;ure, and that it may not touch the innocent Souls of tho&s;e poor Gentlemen, who (as I under&s;tand) are likewi&s;e in &s;trait Impri&s;onment for my Sake. If ever I have found Favour in your Sight; if ever the Name of <HI>Anne Boleyn</HI> hath been plea&s;ing in your Ears, then let me obtain this Reque&s;t: and I will &s;o leave to trouble your Grace

<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>_AS there is a Plea&s;ure in owning Obligations which it is an Honour to have received; I mo&s;t humbly beg Leave of Your GRACE to acknowledge my Gratitude hereby.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Favour I have to ask, is, that in the Peru&s;al of the&s;e Letters, Your GRACE will give Attention to the Truth they contain. They were written to &s;a|tisfy the Curio&s;ity of an intimate Friend, as the</HI> French <HI>Editor thus relates,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="223"><Q REND="inline"><P>THE Public will, doubtle&s;s, &s;ays he, be de&s;irous to know by what Accident the&s;e <HI>Letters</HI> fell into my Hands, and what in|duced me to publi&s;h them. I do not que&s;tion, but many will be apt to blame my Temerity, in daring to expo&s;e the <HI>Foible</HI> of &s;o powerful a Nation. To the&s;e Criticks I &s;hall only an&s;wer, that the In|tere&s;t of all the re&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI> has, with me, ta|ken Place of every other Con&s;ideration. Be&s;ides, our Author &s;ays no more than the bare evident Truth: And, for my Part, I &s;hall think my La|bour more than recompenc'd, if the reading of the&s;e Letters may have the wi&s;h'd-for Effect, to deter every Man of Worth from travelling into <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> where he would run the Risk of being expo&s;ed to the &s;ame Tragical Events our <HI>Italian</HI> here relates.</P>
<P>It was by a very extraordinary Accident, no le&s;s than that of a Shipwreck, that the&s;e Letters fell into my Hands. The Author of them was re&s;erved for this new Misfortune, which, in all Probability was the la&s;t of his Life. We may pre&s;ume he did not &s;urvive this fatal Event, and may, therefore, properly apply the following Words to his Ca&s;e:
<Q><L>Fortuna libera mors e&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>This Misfortune, perhaps, befell him in the Voyage, which, towards the Conclu&s;ion of his <HI>la&s;t</HI> Letter, he &s;ays he was ju&s;t upon the Point of undertaking: But it is not very material, when and where it happened. Let it &s;uffice, that a Trunk, which drove on Shoar, falling in|to my Hands, I ob&s;erved a Paper pa&s;ted in the
<PB N="iii" REF="224">
In&s;ide of the Lid, which contained the following In&s;cription:<Q><L>Durae ac dirae Captivitatis</L>

<P>This In&s;cription excited my Curio&s;ity; and ex|amining the Trunk, in which I, at fir&s;t, only &s;aw &s;ome old Cloaths, I di&s;covered a Bundle of Papers, which put a Stop to my Enquiry for the pre&s;ent; I found them to be Letters, but the Hand they were written in was almo&s;t illegible, from whence I concluded, they had been wrote in a great Hurry. I made a Shift to read them, tho' not without a great deal of Pains, and was &s;en&s;ibly moved with the Author's Misfortunes. I was before partly acquainted with what he writes of the <HI>MUSCOVITE Government,</HI> their <HI>Power, Finances,</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;try:</HI> But I was an entire Stranger to all the re&s;t, and not a little &s;urprized
<PB N="iv" REF="225">
to find, that the Pains <HI>PETER</HI> I. had taken to civilize this Nation, were hitherto fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>It is a&s;toni&s;hing, that notwith&s;tanding all which has been done, for above a Century, to bring the&s;e People off from their native Barbarity, they, to this Day, retain the &s;ame Savage Cu&s;|toms and Manners as will appear from the&s;e Letters.</P>
<P>What Idea then mu&s;t we not form of the <HI>Fo|reigners,</HI> who are at the Head of the Admini|&s;tration, in that Country, and who, in the mo&s;t flagrant Manner, abu&s;ed the Confidence repo&s;ed in them, by the be&s;t of PRINCESSES? Mu&s;t they, of Nece&s;&s;ity, as &s;oon as they &s;et Foot in the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Dominions, become very <HI>Mu&s;covites?</HI> I was not entirely ignorant before, of the Con|duct of the&s;e Mini&s;ters: But I could never have believed them capable of carrying Matters this Length. I am a&s;&s;ured from very good Hands, that their whole Aim was to fill their own Cof|fers, that they might be able to &s;creen them&s;elves again&s;t every &s;uture Event; and they are proba|bly &s;o far right: For without any great Skill in A&s;trology, I would venture to pre&s;age, what will be their Fate, whenever the Empre&s;s, who is now their Support, comes to die. In the mean Time, let them think their Mea&s;ures ever &s;o &s;ecure, I very much que&s;tion, whether they will e&s;cape the Storm they are threatned with, if every the Illu&s;trious PRINCESS, who has an inconte&s;table Right to that Crown, acceed to the Throne.</P>
<P>The Manner in which &s;he is treated by the&s;e Mini&s;ters, cries aloud for Vengeance: For, in|&s;tead of re&s;pecting her, as the pre&s;umptive Heir
<PB N="v" REF="226">
of a va&s;t Empire: They do not &s;o much as allow her where withal to &s;upport her Dignity, and to maintain her antient Dome&s;ticks, who chu&s;e ra|ther to linger on in Mi&s;ery, than to quit her Ser|vice. They have even the Cruelty to keep her in a Sort of Bondage, which deters every one from making their Court to her, and is the Occa|&s;ion of her being abandoned by the whole World. This is no Secret to tho&s;e who travel into that Country, and when they return, they &s;peak of it with the utmo&s;t Indignation: But, at the &s;ame Time, they are too well acquainted with the excellent Qualities and Clemency of the pre|&s;ent Empre&s;s, to lay any Part of the Blame on her.</P>
<P>The <HI>Foreign Mini&s;try</HI> are the Authors of all this Evil; and as they are not in&s;en&s;ible how ill they have de&s;erved, there is Rea&s;on to believe they will employ all their Skill to keep the next Heir from the Throne. However, notwith&s;tand|ing their utmo&s;t Efforts, I very much doubt of their Succe&s;s. They are, indeed, at pre&s;ent, ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters, and di&s;po&s;e of every Thing at their own Will: But they may probably be di|ve&s;ted of this Authority, which they now abu&s;e with Impunity, whenever a Matter of that Im|portance, in which all the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> ought to concern them&s;elves, is brought upon the Carpet.</P>
<P>The very &s;ame Rea&s;ons which nece&s;&s;arily prompt this <HI>Foreign Mini&s;try</HI> to aim at the <HI>Ex|clu&s;ion</HI> of the PRINCESS, will of cour&s;e engage the Native <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> to give her their <HI>Suffrages:</HI> And if the <HI>latter</HI> gain their Point, I do not doubt but the <HI>former</HI> will meet the Fate they
<PB N="vi" REF="227">
have de&s;erved. By this Means the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> may &s;hake off the heavy Yoke which they now bear, and I dare an&s;wer for them, they will not let &s;o favourable an Opportunity e&s;cape. In this Ca&s;e, the&s;e <HI>Foreign Gentlemen</HI> will find them|&s;elves in great Danger: I advi&s;e them to be early upon their Guard, and I hope they will make a right U&s;e of the charitable Advice I give them. I likewi&s;e hope they will not take it ami&s;s, that I print the&s;e Letters, nor will com|plain of my Conduct, with Regard to them. They will, I flatter my&s;elf, thank me, for the Regard I have &s;hewn for them, in following my Author, who is &s;o candid to conceal the Names of all his mo&s;t inveterate Enemies, and only to mention tho&s;e of the Per&s;ons to whom he was obliged.</P>
<P>As I am perfectly acquainted with all the In|trigues of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Mini&s;try, it would be no difficult Thing for me to give an exact De|&s;cription of tho&s;e who are at the Head of the Affairs of that Kingdom: But, as well out of Prudence, as Caution, I &s;hall be contented with what I have already &s;aid.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> I &s;hall not need to make any Excu&s;e on their Account: They are not a People to take Pet at &s;o &s;mall a Matter, and they will them&s;elves find, that what is ad|vanced, with Re&s;pect to them, is nothing in Compari&s;on, of what might be &s;aid again&s;t them.</P>
<P>After having &s;atisfied my Curio&s;ity with Re|gard to the&s;e Letters, I, with Eagerne&s;s, re|turned to the <HI>Trunk</HI> which contained them, to
<PB N="vii" REF="228">
examine more narrowly what was yet behind. I there &s;aw the famous <HI>Night-Gown,</HI> which the Author wore, to be taken Notice of by the Empre&s;s and her whole Court, when they pa&s;&s;ed under the Window of his Pri&s;on. There were yet the &s;ame Sheep's-skin-Pelt, and the &s;ame Cap, which were of &s;o much Service to him, in his Journey from <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> to <HI>Petersburg.</HI> The <HI>Trunk</HI> was filled with tattered Cloaths, a few Shirts, and other Nece&s;&s;aries. Be&s;ides the&s;e, I opened a <HI>Hamper,</HI> in which were &s;ome Bottles, Earthen Plates, and Wooden Forks. I, likewi&s;e, found an Iron Fork, much larger than the others, which probably the &s;ame our Author mentions in &s;everal Parts of his Letters, and which he imagined, he might have made an advantageous U&s;e of, as a Weapon, in Ca&s;e of Need. There was even the very Axe, by the Help of which he &s;o dextrou&s;ly opened his <HI>Trunk.</HI></P>
<P>At Length, I was agreeably &s;urprized with a Roll of Paper, which I, at fir&s;t Sight, took for a Manu&s;cript: But after having unfolded it, with a great deal of Impatience, hoping to find &s;ome important Secret inclo&s;ed; I was amazed to &s;ee only a few blank Leaves, on which &s;ome few Characters were perceivable. I &s;oon apprehended the&s;e to be the Papers he mentions to have writ upon with his Silver Pencil, without Ink, and which after the Misfortune he met with, of fall|ing into a Pit, in <HI>Courland,</HI> were become ille|gible.</P>
<P>After having carefully examined, whatever was in the <HI>Trunk,</HI> I acquainted &s;everal Friends with my Re&s;olution of publi&s;hing the&s;e Letters: But I found their Opinions very various. I &s;hall
<PB N="viii" REF="229">
therefore only mention &s;ome of the principal Reflections that were made on this Account.</P>
<P>One of the Events, which, among others, greatly &s;urprized us, was that of the Attempt, which our Author endeavours to prove, was made to Poi&s;on him. We carefully examined his Allegations, and found them all well grounded. Let any Man judge with what Horror we con|&s;idered &s;o black, and &s;o dete&s;table an Action.</P>
<P>Having enquired into this important Point, the next Thing we fell upon was, his Attempt to di&s;cover the Original of the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> As Novelty never fails of plea&s;ing, this Pa&s;&s;age en|tertained us &s;ome Time, and every one was al|lowed to give his Opinion freely. At fir&s;t, none would decide upon the Matter, for Fear of be|ing deceived; &s;ome &s;aid the Thought was inge|nious, but had no Foundation: Others looked upon it as a Thing demon&s;trated beyond all Con|tradiction.</P>
<P>While we were thus in Su&s;pence what to de|termine, one of the Company propo&s;ed to look upon the Author's Opinion as a mere Conjecture. This every one approved of, and thereby an End was &s;oon put to this Di&s;pute. This Per&s;on added, that if we would indulge him a Moment, he would &s;et us right in &s;everal Circum&s;tances, which our Author had not mentioned, either be|cau&s;e they had e&s;caped his Memory; or, perhaps, becau&s;e he never had an Opportunity of being informed of them. The whole Company having expre&s;&s;ed an eager De&s;ire of hearing what he had farther to propo&s;e, he related a Fact of which we were all ignorant, tho' the Truth of it is in|conte&s;table,
<PB N="ix" REF="230">
<HI>viz.</HI> That the third Expedition of the <HI>Scythians</HI> into <HI>A&s;ia</HI> is fixed, by the mo&s;t able Chronologi&s;ts, to <HI>A.M.</HI> 3334, which is ju&s;t 676 Years before the <HI>Chri&s;tian-Aera:</HI> This being pre|mi&s;ed, our Author might with Rea&s;on &s;ay, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> would be in the wrong, to com|plain of the Original he a&s;cribes to them; for if it be not one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious, it is, at lea&s;t, one of the mo&s;t antient. He acquainted us farther, that the City, which he calls the <HI>City of Slaves,</HI> is now known by the Name of <HI>Clopi|gorod,</HI> and is &s;ituated in the very Country, thro' which the&s;e wretched People made their Retreat. The&s;e Illu&s;trations, put us to reflect upon the Fact in Que&s;tion, not only as probable, but as an evident Truth.</P>
<P>While we proceeded in the Peru&s;al of the&s;e <HI>Letters,</HI> every one gave their Opinions, and &s;ome made very judicious and curious Reflections. But the reading of the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Letter, made us almo&s;t forget all that had been &s;aid on the foregoing. The &s;ingle Circum&s;tance of the <HI>Pa&s;s</HI> given to our Author, fixed the Attention of the whole Company. This Procedure of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> by which they expo&s;ed him to be looked upon as the mo&s;t ba&s;e and vile&s;t of Men, excited a general Indignation in us. Every one exclai med again&s;t this Piece of flagrant Inju&s;tice, and the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> were treated as they de&s;erved. Who could blame us? Can they &s;ay any Thing in Ju&s;|tification of them&s;elves, for &s;ullying the Reputa|tion of a <HI>Man of Honour,</HI> without any Cau&s;e, and brand him with the Character of a Spy, in a &s;trange Country? Was it not enough, that they had detained him &s;o long in a grievous Captivity, wherein they had &s;ubjected him to a thou&s;and
<PB N="x" REF="231">
Evils? A Man of Worth would much rather chu&s;e to dye, than to &s;uffer &s;uch a Blemi&s;h on his Reputation.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as we were going to part, a Gentleman asked, if there was not any one among&s;t us, in|clinable to take a Voyage to <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> in Hopes of making his Fortune? This Propo&s;al &s;urprized us all, &s;o much, that we could not but turn it into Ridicule; and &s;oon replied in the Negative, alledging, that we &s;hould expect the &s;ame Fate which our Author had undergone. This, &s;ays he, is the very An&s;wer I expected: For the&s;e <HI>Letters</HI> I mu&s;t own are a &s;ufficient Warning to all Stran|gers, <HI>Felix quem faciunt,</HI> &amp;c. how they tru&s;t to <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Integrity. For which Rea&s;on the pub|li&s;hing of the&s;e will be a Public Benefit. I re|plied, that in Regard to the favourable Judg|ment they had formed of the&s;e Letters, I &s;hould not he&s;itate, but would forthwith print them; but begged Leave to make one Ob&s;ervation which e&s;caped their Notice, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI> them&s;elves, and even their <HI>Foreign Mi|ni&s;try,</HI> under who&s;e Rule they are, &s;o far from having Rea&s;on to complain of the Publication of the&s;e <HI>Letters,</HI> might be greatly benefitted by them, and could not but be thankful to us for it. For, we all know, that, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> bear a mortal Hatred to the <HI>Foreigners,</HI> who are at the Head of their Affairs, and wi&s;h nothing more, than to be rid of them. On the other Hand, it is no le&s;s certain, that the <HI>Foreigners,</HI> who find they have Power enough to &s;upport their Cabal, u&s;e all the Skill they are Ma&s;ters of, to keep other <HI>Foreigners</HI> from getting a Footing in that Court. It is therefore, doing con&s;iderable Service to Both, to publi&s;h the&s;e <HI>Letters:</HI> Since
<PB N="xi" REF="232">
it is not to be imagined, that tho&s;e who read them, will ever think of &s;eeking an Employ in <HI>Mu&s;covy?</HI> By this Means, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> will have no Rea&s;on to complain of Interlopers, and the <HI>Foreigners,</HI> who are now employed, need not be apprehen&s;ive of lo&s;ing their Places, or being emulated by Rivals.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;ervation was approved by all who were pre&s;ent; but then another Difficulty was, at the &s;ame Time, &s;tarted. It was objected, that the&s;e <HI>Letters,</HI> being written by an <HI>Italian,</HI> who, perhaps, had never any Thoughts of their being publi&s;hed, it would be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to revi&s;e them, and to correct the Stile. To which it was judiciou&s;ly an&s;wered, That a Work like this, which was written with no other In|tent, but that of obliging a Friend, ought to be given to the Publick, without any Alteration; and it is hoped their intrin&s;ick Worth will de|&s;erve that they &s;hould be tran&s;lated into all the <HI>European</HI> Languages, and may return to <HI>Mu&s;co|vy</HI> and prove a <HI>Speculum</HI> to tho&s;e of <HI>other</HI> Na|tions now re&s;ident there. I do not in the lea&s;t doubt but the <HI>Italians</HI> in particular, would, in Vindication of their Countryman, be the fir&s;t to put their Hands to the Plough, and other Na|tions, doubtle&s;s, will &s;oon follow their Example. The <HI>Germans</HI> are principally concerned in this Matter, becau&s;e a great Number of their Coun|trymen go daily into <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> to <HI>&s;eek their For|tune.</HI> The Example of &s;ome <HI>fal&s;e Brethren</HI> ought not to hinder them from concurring in a Matter from whence &s;o much Good may re&s;ult: But if I &s;hould even be deceived in my Hopes, I will ne|ver for&s;ake &s;o ju&s;t a Cau&s;e during Life; but re|&s;olutely maintain it.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOUR generous Behaviour to|wards Me may hereafter &s;erve as an Example to all who make Profe&s;&s;ion of Friend&s;hip. You had all the Rea&s;on in the World to believe me lo&s;t to you, and for ever; and yet this did not hinder you from doing for me, whatever could be done by tho&s;e who are in a Condition to give daily Proofs of their Affection one to the other. This may be &s;tiled Friend&s;hip even to the Dead: Among the Number of whom you could not but account me, &s;ince you had no News from me, and nothing but Death could be &s;uppo&s;ed to prevent my Wri|ting. I am more than convinced of all the Effects you &s;ay my fir&s;t Letter had upon you, and you will be as fully per&s;uaded of tho&s;e, which yours could produce in me. We know each other too well to need any farther Explication on this Head.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, you cannot forbear looking upon me, as a Per&s;on ri&s;en from the Dead; and you are &s;o
<PB N="2" REF="235">
far right: I am not dead, indeed, becau&s;e <HI>Mors mi&s;eros fugit;</HI> but I may, neverthele&s;s, be e&s;teemed a Gho&s;t, &s;ince I am actually returned from another World, where I have made no &s;hort Abode. I learn every Day &s;omething new and &s;urprizing, and that almo&s;t with the &s;ame Plea&s;ure a deaf Man would, who &s;hould at once recover the Organs of Hear|ing. The earne&s;t De&s;ire you expre&s;s, of having a circum&s;tantial Account of my Adventures, looks as if you expected &s;omething extraordinary and wonderful, and therein, you are not mi&s;taken. Had the &s;ame Things happened to another, I my &s;elf &s;hould have been backward in believing them: <HI>Tri&s;te petit munus:</HI> But &s;hould I refu&s;e to &s;atisfy your Curio&s;ity, it would be the fir&s;t Time you ever a&s;ked me any thing in vain. I &s;hall not, therefore, he&s;itate a Moment, and the le&s;s, as a renewed Friend&s;hip requires more A&s;&s;iduity than that which has never been broken. Ours may well be &s;aid to be renewed, &s;ince it is come back from the other World. What terrifies me is, that Accuracy of Relation which you require of me. For I am &s;cru|pulous enough with you, to endeavour &s;trictly to obey you. Had it not been for an unhappy Ship|wreck, which I &s;uffered, at a Time when I might have thought my &s;elf lea&s;t liable to a Misfortune of that Nature, I &s;hould, perhaps, have been able to fulfil your De&s;ires. Some Memoirs which I had written in a very peculiar Manner, would have been of great Service to my Hi&s;tory: But they are not at all legible. I have, indeed, pre&s;erved a &s;hort Journal, which now mu&s;t &s;upply every Thing. Had any one but you made this Reque&s;t, I &s;hould have found more than one rea&s;onable Excu&s;e for a Denial. It is not a bare Relation of my Fate will content you; I mu&s;t give you the Hi&s;tory of a whole Nation, its Manners and Government, and de&s;cribe it to you, in &s;uch a Light as I found it,
<PB N="3" REF="236">
and not &s;uch as, perhaps, you, and many others have believed it to be. It is true, &s;ince the Be|ginning of this Century, we have had a more ex|ten&s;ive Knowledge of this Nation, than formerly; and the great Reform which has been attempted in it, has furni&s;hed ample Occa&s;ion for Di&s;cour&s;e. You will &s;ee how far it has &s;ucceeded, and whe|ther the Pains which have been taken, and the Tor|rents of Blood which have been &s;hed, have an&s;wered Expectation? It is generally &s;aid, we mu&s;t travel to know the Manners of People: But, to my Co&s;t, I have found, that it is requi&s;ite to know them, before we leave our own Home. You will be the more convinced of this Truth, the farther you pro|ceed in the Hi&s;tory of my Adventures.</P>
<P>In my former Letter, I advis'd you, that after the Misfortune which obliged me to leave a Coun|try, I &s;hall regret to the la&s;t Period of my Life, tran&s;ported by a ju&s;t De&s;pair, I had no other Thoughts but of retiring to &s;ome Place, where I might be entirely unknown; but my evil De&s;tiny continued to pur&s;ue me, and directed my Choice to the only Part of the World, where &s;he could exerci&s;e her mo&s;t cruel Tyranny upon me: For I am per&s;uaded, there is no other Country, in which I could have been expo&s;ed to the like Events. I &s;hall leave you to judge of the&s;e Matters; be prepared only to give Attention to what I am a|bout to relate. You will find &s;ome Things to a|mu&s;e and divert you, and others which will ju&s;t|ly rai&s;e your Indignation, and compel you to al|low, that it is with Truth, I &s;ay, I am returned from another World.</P>
<P>Being arrived at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> where I made &s;ome Stay, I re&s;olved to conceal my &s;elf from the whole World, under the Character of an <HI>Italian</HI> Mer|chant, with the Name of <HI>Roccaforte.</HI> My Imagi|nation probably &s;ugge&s;ted this Name to my Mind,
<PB N="4" REF="237">
to encourage me to undergo all my Misfortunes with Con&s;tancy. In the mean Time, unea&s;y, and tired as I was, with a painful Journey by Land, I was for trying if I could leave &s;ome Share of my Sorrows there, and embarked, in the Beginning of <HI>May,</HI> 1733. on Board a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, bound for St. <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> whither my Inclinations led me.</P>
<P>We departed from the Harbour the next Day, with a tolerable good Wind; but the Day follow|ing, about the &s;ame Hour, were again in the &s;ame Place, having been obliged to return fa&s;ter than we &s;et out. We hoi&s;ted Sail, a &s;econd Time: But the Incon&s;tancy of the Weather, and the Violence of the Winds, drove us, for the &s;pace of a Fort|night, &s;ometimes on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Pomerania,</HI> &s;ometimes on tho&s;e of <HI>Denmark;</HI> now on the <HI>Swe|di&s;h</HI> Coa&s;ts, and then on the <HI>Livonian;</HI> where a Sight of the I&s;land of <HI>Dagho</HI> had like to have co&s;t us dear, by the Un&s;kilfulne&s;s of our Pilot. A Want of Provi&s;ions began to augment our Fears, the Voyage from <HI>Dantzick</HI> to <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> being gene|rally eight or ten Days, whereas we had been al|ready fifteen, at Sea. We were often in Sight of the I&s;land of <HI>Gothland;</HI> but with &s;uch &s;tormy Weather, as obliged us to keep the Sea. At Length, we happily gained the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t of that I&s;land, where, among a Number of Rocks, we found a proper Anchorage. It was with great Plea&s;ure I went on Shoar, where the fir&s;t thing I ob&s;erved was, by certain Marks, that the Sea was retired from that Place: The next Day, I was fully con|vinced of it, and &s;aw that it had left a good half League of dry Land. We were &s;o fortunate to find a Hou&s;e, and whatever we wanted to re-vic|tual our Ship.</P>
<P>During our Stay there, which was three or four Days, I diverted my &s;elf with taking long Walks, and I found very plea&s;ant ones all along the Shoar,
<PB N="5" REF="238">
with Situations very proper for the Abode of a Wretch like my &s;elf. You will laugh at another Remark I made, in this I&s;land; which is, that of one Species of Birds, common every where el&s;e, at lea&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> and that &s;mall part of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> I have travelled through, I mean <HI>Sparrows,</HI> not any are to be &s;een there. If you ask me the Rea&s;on of it, I &s;hall ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s my Ignorance, &s;ince there are many other Kinds of Birds. I could gladly have &s;taid &s;ome Days longer, in this charm|ing Solitude: But the Time for our Departure was come, and we were de&s;tined to be, another Fort|night, the Sport of the Winds, which, at length, drove us into the Port of <HI>Revel.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Accidents, which happened to me in my Voyage, were de&s;igned, by Fate, to give me a Fore&s;ight of what I was to expect when arrived in Port: But I was not capable of Reflection; my Thoughts were bent on nothing but carrying my De&s;pair and Sorrows to a Place, where they might not be &s;een or known by any one. After having furni&s;hed our&s;elves with &s;ome Provi&s;ions at <HI>Revel,</HI> we put to Sea again, and, not to tire your Pati|ence any longer, after a mo&s;t unfortunate Voyage of &s;ix Weeks, we arrived, the 20th of <HI>June,</HI> at <HI>Peter&s;burg.</HI>
<Q><L>Ergo erat in fatis <HI>Scythiam</HI> quoque vi&s;ere no&s;tris!</L></Q></P>
<P>But before I &s;uffer this Exclamation to carry me too far, I mu&s;t &s;olemnly prote&s;t, that being about to treat of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Nation, of which, <HI>Difficile e&s;t Satyram non &s;cribere,</HI> I except the Au|gu&s;t SOVERAIGN, who now rules it, for whom I have the mo&s;t profound Veneration. I am ac|quainted with her extraordinary Qualities, and e&s;|pecially her Religion and Piety. I am not igno|rant, in what an excellent Manner &s;he di&s;pen&s;es her Ju&s;tice and Clemency; but what is mo&s;t ad|mirable,
<PB N="6" REF="239">
is her extreme good Nature, a Quality rarely to be met with on the Throne; which, however, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the highe&s;t Degree of Perfection, and extends to the utmo&s;t of her Pow|er, tho' always far &s;hort of her Inclination: So that, in many Ca&s;es, we might ju&s;tly make her &s;peak the Language of <HI>Iphigenia,</HI>
<Q><L>Non ego crudelis, juvenes igno&s;cite, dixit:</L>
<L>Sacra &s;uo facio barbariora loco.</L></Q></P>
<P>In &s;hort, to &s;ay every Thing in a few Words; there is nothing wanting in her, that can be de&s;ired; but, on the contrary, what &s;he might rea&s;onably ex|pect, &s;he is far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing: Her Merits give her a Title to govern another Sort of People, who might be capable of knowing and perceiving the Happine&s;s they enjoy in her Per&s;on, and to have another Kind of Subjects about her, who might a&s;&s;i&s;t her in &s;upporting the Burthen of &s;o va&s;t a Go|vernment.</P>
<P>As for the Illu&s;trious <HI>Prince&s;s,</HI> the only Remains of the Family which now reigns; they only, who have not &s;een nor heard of her, can be at a Lo&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h her from the re&s;t of the Nation. The Qualities of her Mind and Body are a Con|junction of whatever is excellent: And if I &s;hould pretend to give you a Detail of what I have &s;een of one, and heard of the other, I &s;hould not be &s;o &s;oon able to give you Satisfaction, with Regard to my &s;elf. Let it then &s;uffice, that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es eve|ry Quality, in &s;uch a Perfection; <HI>Qu&acirc; faemina na&s;ci nulla pote&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Having rendered, <HI>Quae &s;unt Cae&s;aris Cae&s;ari,</HI> I re|turn to my Voyage, which we pur&s;ued up the <HI>Nieva,</HI> till we came near a fine Bridge of Boats, that cro&s;&s;es it. I would gladly have landed immedi|ately; but the Officers, who were put on Board our Ve&s;&s;el at <HI>Cron&s;tadt,</HI> would not &s;uffer us to car|ry
<PB N="7" REF="240">
the lea&s;t Thing from the Ship: I was, there|fore, forced to &s;tay on Board, and it was three Days before our Ma&s;ter could get his Clearances; which gave me not the be&s;t Idea of their Regulati|ons with Regard to Trade. In this Interval, all I could do was to amu&s;e my &s;elf with what came within my View. The fir&s;t Thing which offered was the Bridge, which &s;erves for a Commu|nication of one Part of the Town with the other. It is little frequented, from whence I concluded the Place not populous, and I was not deceived. The Ships which are ranged on both Sides of the River, in a Symetrical Order, make a pretty agre|able View, but the re&s;t is no way an&s;werable to this Part of the Town, which may be called fine. Suffer me now to gue&s;s at your De&s;ires: I am per|&s;uaded, that amid&s;t the Accuracy of the Relations you de&s;ire from me, they do not extend to a De|&s;cription of Things; that would be an Entertain|ment too gro&s;s for your refined Ta&s;te; nor &s;hall I want Matter, without that, to employ a good Part of your Time: For being to give you an Account of a Captivity, which la&s;ted two whole Years, Circum&s;tances will offer, of &s;ufficient Importance to de&s;erve not to be treated in a <HI>Laconic</HI> Manner.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Per&s;on I became acquainted with at <HI>Pe|ter&s;burg</HI> was a Merchant who&s;e Name is <HI>Mariotti,</HI> a very hone&s;t Man, and to whom I am highly oblig|ed. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in every Thing within his Sphere, and I am per&s;uaded he would have done more had it been in his Power. I went to the <HI>Roman Catho|lic</HI> Church, and vi&s;ited the Fathers who officiated in it, whither a pretty many People re&s;orted. I there u&s;ed my be&s;t Endeavours to get Information of &s;uch Things as were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, on my Ar|rival in a Country where I propo&s;ed to &s;ettle. I picked up my Intelligences, &s;ome here, &s;ome there, and neglected no Opportunity to be in&s;tructed.
<PB N="8" REF="241">
Thus, in a few Days, I ea&s;ily perceived, this was no Country for my Purpo&s;e; but I was advanced too far to retreat. My Bu&s;ine&s;s was how to get into the Service; I advi&s;ed with Mr. <HI>Mariotti</HI> about it: But he laid &s;o many Difficulties before me, as threw me into an unu&s;ual Di&s;order.</P>
<P>While my Thoughts where thus employed what Cour&s;e to take, I accidentally &s;aw a Per&s;on, who I believed might know me, and be&s;ides met with a very &s;ingular Adventure, which obliged me to take other Mea&s;ures. I formed the Re&s;olution of going to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where I knew the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e-Hom|burg</HI> commanded, and the Character I had heard of him gave me Room to hope, that if I made my &s;elf known to him, he would not refu&s;e me the Honour of his Protection. I but ju&s;t hint at the&s;e Matters now, becau&s;e you will find a particular Account of them, in a Petition I pre&s;ented to the <HI>Czarina</HI>'s Cabinet-Council. But I mu&s;t acquaint you with the chief Motive that put me upon going to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which I could not in&s;ert in that Piece, as you your&s;elf will judge. Being continually in|qui&s;itive after a Knowledge of Things, I likewi&s;e gathered all the News I could, not only what was publi&s;hed in the <HI>Gazettes,</HI> but what I could learn from the Per&s;ons I conver&s;ed with. Among the latter was one who was perfectly acquainted with the Projects, De&s;igns, and Preparations of the Court of <HI>Petersburg,</HI> and who knew the Strength, as well as the weak Side, of this Power, which now &s;o much alarms <HI>Europe,</HI> tho' I &s;ee no Rea&s;on for it. By all I could learn, I was convinced, that the War in <HI>Poland</HI> was inevitable, and that if I engaged in the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Service, I &s;hould, perhaps, be obliged to draw my Sword again&s;t a Prince I re&s;pect, and again&s;t a Nation I &s;hall love with my late&s;t Breath, and to which I owe the little Know|ledge I have in the Art of War. You know me
<PB N="9" REF="242">
&s;o much a <HI>Frenchman</HI> at Heart, to be intirely per|&s;uaded, I &s;hould rather quit the Profe&s;&s;ion of a Sol|dier for ever, than engage again&s;t the Intere&s;t of King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> and the Troops employed to &s;up|port his lawful Rights. The Declaration made by the <HI>French</HI> King, to all the Mini&s;ters I had &s;een, left me no Room to doubt, but he would employ all his Force in &s;o ju&s;t a Cau&s;e, for which the Ho|nour of the <HI>French</HI> Name is &s;o tenderly concerned. I leave you to judge, whether I could bear to be in the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Army, in View of the Troops of <HI>France;</HI> I dete&s;t the very Thoughts of it. This was the true Motive which fixed my Re&s;olution of going to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and you are by this Time &s;en&s;ible I could not in&s;ert it in the Petition mentioned above. As &s;oon as my De&s;ign was formed, I &s;poke to my Friend <HI>Mariotti</HI> to look out for a Con|veniency of going thither; and in order to pro|vide what was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for my Journey, I &s;old a good Part of my Equipage, to rai&s;e Money. My next Care was to get a Pa&s;s, which is not to be obtained without Difficulty, and at a great Ex|pence, e&s;pecially if it be to go out of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Dominions: But as this was not my Ca&s;e, I got off for four or five Rubles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Coin about the Value of a Crown.</NOTE>: A &s;hameful Practice, to oblige People to pay for a Pa&s;s! What mu&s;t a Per&s;on do who has but ju&s;t enough to bear the Expences of his Journey? Why truly, he mu&s;t remain there, and &s;ubmit to Slavery, as has been the Ca&s;e of many. A Foreigner, who has lived &s;ome Time among them, finds it difficult to ob|tain his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. They are no &s;ooner informed of his Intent, than they rai&s;e Su&s;picions, and carry their Jealou&s;y and Di&s;tru&s;t to an Exce&s;s. Who|ever has once got a Knowledge of their Affairs, mu&s;t never hope to leave the Country. They imagine, they have Rea&s;on to apprehend &s;uch a one would divulge their <HI>Arcana.</HI> What more &s;en&s;ible Evi|dence
<PB N="10" REF="243">
can there be of the Weakne&s;s of their Go|vernment?</P>
<P>All I advance on this Head is but too well|grounded, and I could give a Number of In|&s;tances which would &s;ufficiently evince this Truth: But I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to One, that of an <HI>Itali|an,</HI> who calls him&s;elf <HI>Sava,</HI> and who has ren|dered the Empre&s;s &s;uch Services, as put it out of the Power of this Prince&s;s to acknowledge them. As his Ca&s;e has been already made public, I &s;hall not detain you with a long Account of it: And only add, that this Man, after having long &s;erved the State, could not obtain Leave to pa&s;s the Re&s;t of his Days with his Wife, at <HI>Venice.</HI> Does not this &s;ingle In&s;tance of <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Politicks &s;urprize you? For my Part, I think it the more &s;hocking; as the Per&s;on I am &s;peaking of de&s;erves a better Fate. But to return to my own Concerns.</P>
<P>Having procured a Pa&s;s, I wanted nothing but a favourable Opportunity of departing, and &s;oon after one offered, &s;uch, I thought, as my Heart could wi&s;h. I embraced it with the greater Plea|&s;ure, as I was convinced I &s;hould, by this Means, pur&s;ue my Journey, with Safety and Delight. It was not ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that &s;uch an Opportunity could ever be the Source of a grievous Captivity, and of all my Misfortunes. You, without doubt, know, that the Emperor PETER I. founded an Academy of Sciences, which is yet in being, but in &s;o confu&s;ed a State, that the principal Members of it have de&s;ired their Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. Perhaps, likewi&s;e, you have heard of an Expedition to the North-Ea&s;tern Parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> to a Country call'd <HI>Kamt&s;chatki,</HI> in which the <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI> have already &s;ettled &s;ome Colonies. This Undertaking furni&s;hed me with the Opportunity I am &s;peaking of. Three Profe&s;&s;ors of the Aca|demy, one of A&s;trology, a &s;econd of Hi&s;tory, and a third of Botany, were to be &s;ent to this Country,
<PB N="11" REF="244">
and they, with &s;everal others, formed a &s;ort of Ca|ravan. Their Way lay through the Kingdom of <HI>Ca|&s;an,</HI> which was likewi&s;e my Road to <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> As &s;oon as I was informed, that the&s;e Gentlemen were preparing to depart, I did what I could to be one of the Company. I fir&s;t enquired to whom I mu&s;t make my Application, for this End, and was told to Mon&s;. <HI>de l'I&s;le,</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of A&s;tronomy, Brother of the late Mon&s;. <HI>de l'I&s;le,</HI> the famous Geo|grapher to his mo&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Maje&s;ty. This Gentle|man left <HI>France,</HI> and went to <HI>Petersburg,</HI> in the Time of <HI>Peter</HI> I. who had de&s;ired him of the <HI>French</HI> King. As I &s;hall have frequent Occa&s;ion, in the Sequel, to mention him and his Spou&s;e, I mu&s;t not omit ma|king you acquainted with their Characters; but I mu&s;t previou&s;ly tell you, that their Merit infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;es whatever I can &s;ay of them. Good Na|ture, Genero&s;ity, Candour, and every other Quality, which can render a Per&s;on amiable, are perfectly united in them. I may &s;ay, in &s;hort, they are an Honour to the <HI>French</HI> Nation. A rare <HI>Phenome|non,</HI> to pre&s;erve &s;o many good Qualities among a People, who hardly know one of them! Nothing can be a more convincing Proof of it, than what they did for me during my Captivity.</P>
<P>When I waited on Mon&s;. <HI>de l'I&s;le,</HI> to concert, with him, the Mea&s;ures I had to take; he received me with an unprecedented Politene&s;s, and gave me a mo&s;t favourable Reception. He told me, that he was not to go the Journey him&s;elf, but that it was his Brother, Mon&s;. <HI>de la. Croyere,</HI> who, without doubt, would rejoice at having my Com|pany. I afterwards &s;poke of it to Mon&s;. <HI>de la Croyere,</HI> and to the other Profe&s;&s;ors, who readily granted my De&s;ire. Some Days after, Mon&s;. <HI>de la Croyere,</HI> de&s;ired me to come to his Hou&s;e, in Order to depart, the next Day: But, their la&s;t Di&s;patches not being ready, our Journey was de|layed
<PB N="12" REF="245">
a good while longer. During this Inter|val, Mon&s;. and Madam <HI>de l'I&s;le</HI> compelled me to be with them, and treated me as an intimate Friend. There it was I got acquainted with Mon&s;. <HI>du Vernoi,</HI> a very learned Profe&s;&s;or of Anatomy, and a Man of unque&s;tionable Worth: To whom I have great Obligations for Services done me; And as I &s;hall mention him farther in the Sequel of my Hi&s;tory, I thought it my Duty to make you acquainted with him. As our whole Conver|&s;ation at Mon&s;. <HI>de l'I&s;le</HI>'s, turned upon the Expe|dition to <HI>Kamt&s;chatki,</HI> I had &s;ome Inclination to go thither my &s;elf, and it was compatible enough with my Re&s;olution of being unknown. I opened my Mind to Mon&s;. <HI>de l'I&s;le,</HI> and we de|bated on it &s;ome Days: But, upon mature En|quiry, finding neither Order nor Management in the De&s;ign, I thought no more of it. And, in|deed, they were &s;o ill prepared for it, that on the very Day intended for our Departure, we were obliged to put it off a Fortnight, to regulate cer|tain Matters, which ought to have been provided for long before. Such is the Cu&s;tom of the Country; Nothing is done there <HI>To-day,</HI> every Thing is put off till <HI>To-morrow,</HI> which I have too often experienced to my Co&s;t, and been forced to put up with tho&s;e <HI>To-days</HI> and <HI>To-morrows,</HI> for three Months together.</P>
<P>At length, after many Delays, on the mo&s;t fri|volous Accounts in the World, we were upon the Point of departing: But two of the&s;e Gentlemen having &s;ome Doubts, I went before, with a Ser|vant, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Croyere</HI> was &s;o kind to give me. We agreed upon a Place, where we were all to meet, and pur&s;ue our Journey afterwards to|gether. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de l'I&s;le</HI> and his Spou&s;e, not &s;atisfied with the Civilities they had &s;hewn me, loaded me with &s;uch a Quantity of Provi&s;ions, as
<PB N="13" REF="246">
would have &s;erved me quite to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> had I been allowed to pur&s;ue my intended Journey thither.</P>
<P>The Day of my Departure was the 15th of <HI>Au|gu&s;t,</HI> O.S. I embarked on board a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el as cu&s;tomary, and went up the River <HI>Nieva</HI> to the famous Canal of <HI>Ladoga.</HI> This Canal is &s;ituate in a very mar&s;hy Soil, and is of a va&s;t Extent; but I very much que&s;tion, whether the Advan|tages accruing from it an&s;wer the immen&s;e Sums it co&s;t at fir&s;t; not to mention the prodigious Num|ber of Lives &s;acrificed in that Undertaking. I make little or no Doubt, but it will in&s;en&s;ibly fall to Decay; becau&s;e it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to keep it in Repair, without a con&s;iderable yearly Expence; and, on the other Hand, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are not enough inured to Labour to continue &s;uch painful Works long.</P>
<P>From this Canal of <HI>Ladoga,</HI> I entered the River <HI>Wolkowa,</HI> in which there are Currents of an a&s;to|ni&s;hing Rapidity, and very difficult to &s;tem. The Violence of the Stream broke the Rope which drew my Barque; but, by good Fortune, it happened at a Place, where the Danger was not great, and all the Damage I &s;uffered was being carried &s;ome Di&s;tance back again. However, not to incur the like Danger again, I took care always to land, when I found my&s;elf expo&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>The&s;e Currents, or rather Cataracts of the <HI>Lado|ga,</HI> are a Hinderance to the Advantages propo&s;ed by this Canal. The chief Aim of digging it, was to facilitate the Communication of the <HI>Wolga</HI> with the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and &s;o far it has &s;ucceeded; becau&s;e, by this River, there is a very ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age even to the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. It is, likewi&s;e, of great Service to the Tran&s;port from <HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> to <HI>Petersburg.</HI> As for the Tran&s;port of Goods from <HI>Petersburg</HI> into the Country, I look upon this De&s;ign as very dif|ficult. How is it po&s;&s;ible Ve&s;&s;els, heavy laden, &s;hould
<PB N="14" REF="247">
&s;tem the&s;e Currents? What Dangers would they not be expo&s;ed to? And &s;uppo&s;ing it practicable, how few Merchants would be at the Expence of an Undertaking of this Nature?</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e Currents, I continued my Journey through a Country equally populous and well cultivated. I traver&s;ed the great <HI>Novogrod,</HI> which carried me into the Lake of <HI>Imen;</HI> from thence into the River <HI>Mi&s;ta,</HI> which I was likewi&s;e obliged to go up as far as <HI>Bronitz,</HI> the Rendez-vous ap|pointed by my Friend <HI>de la Croyere.</HI> We both rejoiced at our happy Me&egrave;ting, and after having continued our Journey &s;ome Days by Land, we embarked on the <HI>Twer&s;a,</HI> a little River, which falls into the <HI>Wolga,</HI> at <HI>Twer,</HI> whither we repaired. Here we were obliged to &s;tay about ten Days, to fit out a large Barque, big enough for the whole Caravan. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, this Delay was very te|dious to me: And I could not conceive, how, in an Undertaking of this Importance, Mea&s;ures could have been &s;o ill concerted. But thus, as I ob&s;erved before, it is with every Thing in <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> an eternal Slowne&s;s rules in all their Actions, and if any thing ever &s;ucceeds there, it is generally the Effect of meer Hazard.</P>
<P>All Things being ready for our Departure, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Croyere</HI> would take me into the &s;ame Cabbin provided for him&s;elf. I &s;hall not give you any Account of my Remarks, nor of what happened in my Journey from <HI>Petersburg</HI> to <HI>Ca&s;an.</HI> I had kept a little Journal, but the <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI> thought fit to take away this, and &s;everal other of my Papers. This petty Larceny &s;hews the Character of the People: They were apprehen|&s;ive, the U&s;e I &s;hould make of this Journal might not turn to their Honour, and perhaps they were not mi&s;taken: This, however, is certain, that Di|&s;tru&s;t is one of the evil Qualities of this Nation.
<PB N="15" REF="248">
I think I promi&s;ed to &s;ay &s;omething of <HI>Kamt&s;chatki,</HI> and of the Expedition thither: it is time I keep my Word, and entertain you a Moment on that Head.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the North-Ea&s;t Part of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> differs very much from what it has been long be|lieved to be. It was &s;uppo&s;ed to be bordered by the <HI>Promontorium Glaciale,</HI> or Cape of <HI>Swetenoes.</HI> But it is now di&s;covered, that, at the End of this Cape, there is a large Continent which &s;tretches North and South, for the Space of more than twenty Degrees, and forms a &s;ort of <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> joining to that Part of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> only on the North. On the We&s;tern Side of it, is a Gulph, which &s;e|parates it from <HI>Siberia,</HI> and on the Ea&s;tern Side is the Sea of <HI>Japan.</HI> Towards the South it is bor|dered by a very narrow Streight, full of I&s;lands. For this Di&s;covery we are indebted to the People who inhabit the mo&s;t Northern Parts of <HI>Siberia.</HI> Some pretend it was made by Sea, by doubling the Cape of <HI>Swetenoes:</HI> Others, that it was made on the Land-&s;ide, by advancing very far into the Coun|try; I &s;hall not determine which is the right: But however this be, it is certain the Country is inha|bited by divers Nations, and that, at this Time, a great Number of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Colonies are &s;ettled there. PETER I. &s;ent a <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Sea-Officer thither, called Captain <HI>Berrin;</HI> who, having undertaken the Journey by Land, traver&s;ed <HI>Siberia,</HI> advan|ced to this very Place, and returned. What Di&s;|coveries this Captain made, I cannot pretend &s;o ju&s;tly to &s;ay: But it is to be pre&s;umed, that what|ever Mea&s;ures have been &s;ince taken, are grounded on his Report. The &s;ame Officer has now under|taken this &s;econd Journey thither, by Order of the Empre&s;s, who has intru&s;ted the Direction of this Affair &s;olely to him. He departed &s;ome Months before us, with a large Company, e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="16" REF="249">
of Mariners, and a great Number of Arti|ficers, who are to be employed in building &s;eve|ral Ve&s;&s;els there. The Profe&s;&s;ors hoped to over|take them at <HI>Tobolski,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Siberia,</HI> with the re&s;t of the Caravan.</P>
<P>This Project was formed with &s;everal Views. The fir&s;t is, to e&s;tabli&s;h a Trade with the <HI>Japa|ne&s;e.</HI> The &s;econd, to work at the Mines, which are very rich and numerous, in the Country alrea|dy known: And a third, to attempt new Di&s;co|veries towards <HI>America,</HI> which, perhaps, is not very far from thence; &s;ince the Bounds of the North|ern Part of <HI>California</HI> are not yet known. It is even &s;aid, that Captain <HI>Berrin</HI> has already di&s;cern|ed &s;ome Land on that Side. We mu&s;t allow, that nothing has a more promi&s;ing Appearance, than all the&s;e Views, and, if they &s;ucceed, great Ad|vantages will en&s;ue: But I very much fear, the Court of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> will be deceived in their Expecta|tions, and am concerned for my Friend the A&s;tro|nomer, who has engaged &s;o unwarily in the De|&s;ign. Their Mea&s;ures have been hitherto &s;o ill concerted, that, in all Appearance, this Enter|prize will never &s;ucceed. The greater Part of tho&s;e employed therein are unexperienced Per&s;ons, who have no Talent, nor have I ob&s;erved either Di&s;cipline or Order among them. Neverthele&s;s, a Scheme of this Nature, if well executed, would excite the Attention of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and be an in|expre&s;&s;ible Glory to the Sovereign, under who&s;e Reign it has been formed.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be curious to know what the <HI>Dutch</HI> think of this Undertaking; they, who alone, in <HI>Europe,</HI> carry on a Trade to <HI>Japan.</HI> They would not have much Rea&s;on to be concerned at it: The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are not a very expeditious People to &s;ettle &s;uch a Commerce. But it may be objected, that the Face of Affairs may change in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="250">
The Inhabitants of it are not always the &s;ame; And after all, may not the De&s;ign, which mi&s;car|ried in the fir&s;t Attempt, &s;ucceed in a Second? Vain Imagination! A Change in the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> is a <HI>Phe|nomenon</HI> which will not appear &s;o &s;oon, and which, I confe&s;s, I look upon as impo&s;&s;ible. On the other Hand, there are, in the wi&s;e and mighty Republick of <HI>Holland,</HI> Politicians too refined, and Traders too knowing, not to be watchful for the Security of their Commerce; And if they find &s;uch a Settle|ment likely to take Place, they will not want Means to prevent the Con&s;equences of it. The lea&s;t Su|&s;picions, dextrou&s;ly in&s;inuated into the jealous Minds of the <HI>Japane&s;e,</HI> would alone &s;uffice to overthrow all the Schemes of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> were they even con|certed with more Prudence and Wi&s;dom than they are.</P>
<P>My Journey to <HI>Kamt&s;chatki</HI> has been no le&s;s tedious than that from <HI>Twer</HI> to <HI>Ca&s;an.</HI> We entered the lit|tle River of <HI>Ca&s;anka,</HI> which begun to freeze, and going up it, arrived the 20th of <HI>October</HI> about Noon at <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> where I &s;hall take &s;ome Days Repo&s;e.

<P>_I Take the Advantage of &s;taying at <HI>Ca|&s;an,</HI> as well to recover my &s;elf from the Fatigues of my Journey, as to retrieve, if po&s;&s;ible, the Time I have lo&s;t: But what Satisfaction can I make, for having kept a profound Silence with regard to you, for two whole Years together. The more I think of it, the more I am &s;en&s;ible of my Incapacity: And, in|deed, what Po&s;&s;ibility is there of expre&s;&s;ing the Ob|ligations I lye under, for what you have done in my Behalf!

<P>My la&s;t informed you of our Arrival at <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> the 20th of <HI>October.</HI> It then began to be &s;o cold, that the River was half frozen over. I had &s;o little Thoughts of making any &s;tay there, that my fir&s;t Care was to inquire, if there was any Ve&s;|&s;el bound for <HI>A&s;tracan:</HI> But it was labour in vain, the Sea&s;on was too far advanced. I had no Remedy but to hire a Barque to my &s;elf, and all Nece&s;&s;aries for my Journey were &s;oon provided. My Friends were no &s;ooner informed of my De&s;ign, than they u&s;ed their utmo&s;t Endeavours to di&s;&s;uade me from it. Mon&s;. <HI>de la Croyere,</HI> in particular, gave me &s;uch an Idea of the Difficulties, and repre&s;ented, in &s;uch lively Colours, the Dangers, I was about to expo&s;e my|&s;elf to, that I, at length, determined to wait for an Opportunity of continuing my Journey by Land:
<PB N="19" REF="252">
It was next to impo&s;&s;ible for me to re&s;i&s;t the pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances, which were made me on this Account. My Re&s;olution being fixed, a &s;mall Lodging was provided for me, and as I fore&s;aw my Abode there might be long, I took care to buy tho&s;e Things, I &s;hould &s;tand in need of. The next Point was, what Character I was to appear under: After mature Con&s;ideration, I concluded, it would not become me to remain wholly under Di&s;gui&s;e, and as a Va|grant. I did not in the lea&s;t doubt, but the Profe&s;&s;ors made mention of me; But I was intirely at a Lo&s;s what Con&s;truction was put upon their Di&s;cour&s;e. Be|ing informed that the Governor was a Per&s;on of Di|&s;tinction, who had travelled, and &s;poke <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian,</HI> I took that Re&s;olution, which to me &s;eemed alone becoming a Man of Honour. I paid him a Vi&s;it, the 28th of <HI>October,</HI> and opened my &s;elf to him, in the following Words:</P>

My Pa&s;s, you &s;ee, de&s;cribes me as a Merchant, by a feigned Name; But I mu&s;t confe&s;s to you, that I am a Soldier, of &s;ome Di&s;tinction.

mo&s;t obliging Manner; But perceiving his Counte|nance did not &s;peak the &s;ame Language, I replied: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, as you may have &s;ome Scruple with Re&s;pect to my Per&s;on, I here offer you my Sword, and am ready to &s;urrender my &s;elf your Pri&s;oner, whenever you &s;hall think proper, 'till you know who I am, and in what manner I have behaved."</Q> To which he an&s;wered in the&s;e very Words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fear Nothing, Sir, I am convinced by your Carriage and your Di&s;cour&s;e, that you are the Per&s;on, you &s;ay you are: Let nothing di&s;quiet you, and be a&s;|&s;ured a Pa&s;&s;age &s;hall be provided for you, in the fir&s;t Ship, that departs for <HI>A&s;tracan</HI>:"</Q> Upon this, I took my Leave, without, however, know|ing what Cour&s;e to take: The Surprize I had ob|&s;erved in his Looks, was to me not the mo&s;t au&s;pi|cious Omen.</P>
<P>When I left the Governour, I went directly to Mon&s;. <HI>de la Croyere,</HI> to acquaint him what had hap|pened. I had too much Obligation to conceal any Thing from him.

He immediately demanded my Sword, which I gave him without He&s;itation, telling him, the Governour might have received it him&s;elf, without taking this Step.

<HI>la Croyere,</HI> with his Company, to go out, and then leaving me to the Care of a Corporal and &s;ix Sol|diers, who kept their Bayonets on the Muzzles of their Muskets, he returned to give the Governour an Account of his Expedition. I de&s;ired Mon&s;. <HI>de la Croyere,</HI> when he left me, not to be unea&s;y, nei|ther on his own Account nor mine, a&s;&s;uring him, that the Regard he had &s;hewn for me could never be of any Prejudice to him. The Major returned in a|bout half an Hour, and, taking me in his Sled, carried me to my Lodgings, where all that belong|ed to me were examined with the greate&s;t Exactne&s;s. This was done by a young Man who had the Ap|pearance of an Officer, but who&s;e Carriage be&s;poke him nothing le&s;s. Not the lea&s;t Thing, in my whole Equipage, could e&s;cape his Sight. He unfolded my Shirts, and folded them up again, to &s;ee if he could find any thing concealed in them. In &s;hort, his Hands and Eyes were every where. The Major, who &s;eemed plea&s;ed with his performing his Functi|on with &s;o much Care, told him, with a Sneer: <HI>Thou would&s;t make an excellent</HI> Valet de Chambre, <HI>none better.</HI> I took this young Man to be an Officer, by his Dre&s;s; But if he was &s;o, judge what &s;ort of Officers there are in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> After a nice Enquiry what was to be found, they bundled up my Books, and &s;ome Writings of no great Concern, which they &s;eized and carried off.</P>
<P>Having thus di&s;po&s;ed of my Effects, the next Thing was to &s;ecure my Per&s;on. They carried me to the <HI>Corps de Garde,</HI> which is over-again&s;t the Governour's Hou&s;e. I was there &s;hut up, in the Officer's Room, where a Soldier was placed to guard me, within Sight, with his Sword drawn. I ex|pected, with Impatience, that the Governour would either &s;end for me, or let me know what he de|&s;igned to do with me. It was already pa&s;t Noon, and I &s;aw no Body, but the Officer of the Guard,
<PB N="22" REF="255">
and the Soldiers who went out and in. At length, a very &s;lender Dinner was brought for the Officer, and another Per&s;on who was to dine with him. They were &s;o civil to invite me to take Part with them. I returned them Thanks; But enquiring of them, by Signs, if the Governour would not &s;end me my Por|tion likewi&s;e, they gave me to under&s;tand he would not. In vain I de&s;ired to have &s;omebody I could &s;peak with; I was told I was not to expect it. Hun|ger, in the mean time, pre&s;&s;ing, and &s;eeing nothing brought me, I thought it was be&s;t to accept of their Offer. I neither &s;aw nor heard of any thing farther, the whole Day; and Night being come, I was o|bliged to take up with a Bench in&s;tead of a Bed; where, however, I &s;lept pretty quietly, after ha|ving taken a Knife out of my Pocket, which was trouble&s;ome to me, and which was &s;tolen before Morning, from the Table where I laid it.</P>
<P>I met with no better U&s;age, the Day following: Having therefore expected my De&s;tiny, to no Pur|po&s;e, 'till Noon, I de&s;ired to &s;peak with the Officer, to whom I gave to under&s;tand, by Signs, and pret|ty bluntly, that I was ill u&s;ed; that he &s;hould go to the Governour, and tell him, I expected he &s;hould either &s;end me an Interpreter, or &s;uffer me to &s;peak to him my &s;elf. This Officer, highly &s;urprized to &s;ee a Pri&s;oner, equally haughty in his Ge&s;ttures, and threatning in the Tone of his Voice, went immedi|ately out of the Room, but returned in a Moment, to tell me the Governour was not at Home. Tho this An&s;wer gave me little Satisfaction, I endea|voured to make him under&s;tand &s;everal other Things, but to no Purpo&s;e. He only perceived, that I want|ed to know, whether I &s;hould have any Thing &s;ent me to eat, and to this he again an&s;wered in the Ne|gative. I plainly &s;aw I was to be at my own Ex|pence, and therefore threw a Ruble on the Table, and made Signs to have &s;omething provided for me.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="256">
It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve here, that in the whole Kingdom of <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> a Ruble is a con&s;iderable Sum, &s;ufficient to maintain a Man elegantly for a whole Month. As Money is extream &s;carce in this Country, every thing is exceeding cheap.

<P>They returned me my Change; but I &s;oon per|ceived, that Stewards in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> were no more troubled with Hone&s;ty, than in other Countries. I was, however, under a Nece&s;&s;ity of being cheated in this Manner, during the whole Time of my Captivi|ty. I thought my &s;elf happy, when I met with Peo|ple who were contented with a &s;mall Gain: But this is a <HI>Phenomenon</HI> which rarely appears in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> Pardon, I be&s;eech you, a &s;mall Digre&s;&s;ion. You may, perhaps, be curious to know my Bill of Fare; It con&s;i&s;ted only in Bread, Beer, and a large Piece of boiled Sturgeon. I no &s;ooner &s;at down to my &s;hort Meal, than a Corporal, who was in the Room, came to offer me the Service of a Carver, with the &s;ame Knife which was &s;tolen from me the Night before. I leave you to judge of my Surprize: I fell a laugh|ing, and, at the &s;ame Time, laying hold of my Knife, I gave him to under&s;tand I could di&s;pen&s;e with his Office: But finding he would not let go his Hold, I began to talk big, and hector. My Guards were afraid, and thought proper to &s;end for their Officer. He came in a great Fright, and be|ing informed of the Matter, he offered me his Hand,
<PB N="24" REF="257" MS="y">
and made me give him my Word, that no Mi&s;chief &s;hould en&s;ue. Satisfied with my Promi&s;e, he ordered my Knife to be given me, but I was obliged to re|turn it again after Dinner. This &s;hort Scene let me &s;ee into what Hands I was fallen, and by this I judged what Treatment I had to expect for the fu|ture.
<Q><L>Me &s;civi in media vivere Barbaria.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the Afternoon, my Cloaths were brought me, of which I found they had &s;tolen a good Part. The Linnen I had given to wa&s;h, they brought me quite wet: And as they had &s;eized, among my other Pa|pers, my Laundre&s;s's Bill, I &s;uppo&s;e that was laid, among the Re&s;t, before the Empre&s;s's Cabinet-Council. As for the Receipt for my Rent, which I had paid beforehand, and &s;everal other Things I had bought, they did not think fit to re&s;tore them, nor was ever any farther Mention made of them. In the mean time, I &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in demanding an In|terpreter, or that I might be carried before the Go|vernour; but allIntreaties on thisHead were fruitle&s;s. I then perceived I mu&s;t prepare to return to <HI>Peter&s;|burg,</HI> and con&s;equently undergo the Fatigue of a Journey of 5 or 600 Leagues: For this End, I was de&s;irous at lea&s;t to buy Nece&s;&s;aries to &s;creen me from the Cold; But no Body could or would under&s;tand me, and I was wholly ignorant what would be my Pate.</P>
<P>The next Day, a Man brought my printed Books, which he lock'd up in my Trunk, leaving only a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Almanack, with a little Dictionary, in my Di&s;po&s;al. They likewi&s;e allowed me &s;ome Shirts; but every Thing el&s;e was locked up and &s;ealed. A|bout Four in the Afternoon, I was carried, by a Guard of a Serjeant and two Soldiers, to one of the Suburbs of the City, where I lay, that Night, in the Hou&s;e of a Pea&s;ant; And here it was that I began
<PB N="25" REF="258">
to bully in earne&s;t. I had delivered my Sword, as I have ob&s;erved above, to the City-Major, and it had been kept in my Pri&s;on: When they carried me away, I bid the Serjeant take it with him: But the Officer of the Guard, who probably took a Liking to it, refu&s;ed it, under Pretext, as far as I could under&s;tand, that the Major would &s;end it after me. After having waited for it, &s;ome Time, in vain, I told the Serjeant I was re&s;olved not to go away without my Sword. I &s;poke to him of it, with &s;uch an Air of Authority, that he, at length, thought fit to go for it, and brought it me in a Moment. Happily for me, the Woman of the Hou&s;e where I was, had a Sheep-&s;kin Pelt, quite new, which &s;he &s;eemed very willing to part with, becau&s;e the Wool began to fall off. We &s;oon agreed for the Price, and it was of great Service to me in the Sequel. During my Stay at <HI>Twer,</HI> I had likewi&s;e got a Cap made of a black <HI>Fox</HI>-&s;kin Muff, which co&s;t me a great deal of Mo|ney, tho it was then of no U&s;e to me. I yet keep the&s;e two Pieces of Fur, with the whole Fur|niture of my Captivity, hoping one Time or other to divert you with a Sight of them.</P>
<P>The next Day being appointed for my Depar|ture, they put me into the wor&s;t Sled they could find, and it was the fir&s;t Time, in my Life, I had ever cro&s;&s;ed a River in a Sled. This River is called the <HI>Ca&s;ana,</HI> and was then &s;o frozen as to bear great Burdens: But the Pa&s;&s;age over the <HI>Wol|ga</HI> had like to have proved fatal to me. This Ri|ver is very broad, at the Place where I was to go over it: I believe I &s;peak within Compa&s;s, if I &s;ay, it is at lea&s;t half a League broad. The Ice was pretty &s;trong, to &s;ome Di&s;tance from the Banks; but when we came farther, we met with large Pieces of floating Ice, driving with the Stream. In the Middle of the River, lay a Barque which waited
<PB N="26" REF="259">
for me: But when we came within three or four hundred Paces of it, there was no other Way to get at it, but by jumping from one Flake of Ice to the other. I was, at fir&s;t, terrified with the Danger, and thought it ra&s;h to attempt this Pa&s;|&s;age: However, after &s;ome Reflections, I took Courage, and re&s;olved to run the Hazard of it. I was willing to &s;et an Example to three <HI>Mu&s;co|vites,</HI> who were to follow me. There were &s;eve|ral Per&s;ons more, who de&s;igned to have gone over with us; but who, after having viewed the Dan|ger they were like to expo&s;e them&s;elves to, wi&s;ely re&s;olved to return.</P>
<P>There remained only two <HI>Tartars</HI> and a <HI>Mu&s;co|vite</HI> on the Banks. Seven or eight Men offered me their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, with &s;ome Planks, to be made u&s;e of, in the mo&s;t dangerous Places. But upon &s;econd Thoughts, I believed it advi&s;eable to &s;ee fir&s;t what Cour&s;e the two <HI>Tartars</HI> would take, to overcome the&s;e Difficulties. I beheld them, tho not without laughing, leaping from one Piece of Ice to the other, and &s;oon after getting into the Boat, without any Accident. Encouraged by their Example, I was not long in re&s;olving to fol|low them. Having pulled off my Cloak, I or|dered two Men to walk before me, whom I fol|lowed Step for Step. I thought there was le&s;s Danger in tracing their Foot&s;teps, than if I had taken any other Way. The Walk &s;eemed pretty tedious to me; but, at length, I had the Plea&s;ure to take my la&s;t Leap, into the Barque. My two <HI>Tartars</HI> expre&s;&s;ed their Joy, by Signs, to &s;ee me with them, and I no le&s;s rejoiced, at having e&s;|caped &s;o great a Danger. Tho&s;e who followed me had, likewi&s;e, the good Fortune to get into the Barque to us.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> more timorous than the re&s;t, would be the la&s;t, and was near being lo&s;t. He
<PB N="27" REF="260">
was not half way, when he &s;unk down, between two Pieces of Ice, which, by good Fortune, prov|ed &s;trong enough to bear him up by his two Arms. One of the Pa&s;&s;engers, who happened to be near him, came to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and helped him up, on the Ice again; when perceiving he was nearer the Shoar than the Bark, he cho&s;e rather to go back, than to expo&s;e him&s;elf to new Perils. This Bark carried us over, tho with great Difficulty: For, every Moment, large Pieces of Ice came driv|ing upon us, without any Po&s;&s;ibility of avoiding them.</P>
<P>Being happily arrived, on the other Shoar, I ran towards &s;ome Hou&s;es, which were not far off, to &s;creen my &s;elf from a very piercing Cold, and a North-Wind, which blew hard. My Guards who were not yet recovered from the Fright, which &s;o dangerous a Pa&s;&s;age had put them into, and be|ing be&s;ides taken up with getting my Goods on Shoar, had forgot to keep an Eye upon me. In the mean Time, having found all the Hou&s;es &s;hut, I went into a little Church; where I heartily thanked GOD, for having delivered me from &s;o apparent a Danger. I &s;taid there &s;ome Time, with no other De&s;ign, but to be &s;creen'd from the Cold. Our People, at length, having lo&s;t Sight of me, were alarmed, and ran, with all their Might, directly towards the Hou&s;es, not doubting but I was got into one of them. They were great|ly &s;urprized when they got thither, and I, who &s;awtheir Unea&s;ine&s;s, took a Plea&s;ure in leaving them in it. However, not to carry the Je&s;t too far, I appeared again a Moment afterwards, and ea&s;ed them of the Fears of my being e&s;caped.</P>
<P>We took up our Lodging at a Hou&s;e near the Place of our Landing, being re&s;olved to &s;pend the Night there, to re&s;t from our great Fatigue. Tho our Journey, this Day, had been but &s;hort, it
<PB N="28" REF="261">
might be reckoned one of the mo&s;t &s;evere we had to undergo. Being come to our Quarters, I en|deavoured to convince the Serjeant, who had Care of me, that he might be very ea&s;y on my Ac|count, and I promi&s;ed him to do nothing contrary to his Orders. He under&s;tood me, and taking me by the Hand, expre&s;&s;ed a Satisfaction in my Be|haviour. From this Time forwards, I was no longer a Pri&s;oner, but my Guard became my Ser|vants. After a light Supper, I laid my &s;elf down to re&s;t. The Night was long, and I had Time enough to &s;leep, and to think, at Lei&s;ure, on my unhappy Fate. It may, perhaps, not be di&s;agre|able to you to know what were my Reflections on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>They chiefly ran upon my Adventures. I fir&s;t called to Mind all that <HI>Peter,</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> had done, the Pains he had taken, and the Torrents of Blood he had &s;hed, to extricate his Subjects, from that Barbarity and Ignorance into which they were plunged. I then reflected on his Voyages, Enqui|ries, Labours, and E&s;tabli&s;hments; and I &s;aid to my&s;elf; where are now the Effects of all the Pains this great Monarch took to reform his Peo|ple? Is it po&s;&s;ible that his Subjects &s;hould be yet in the &s;ame State of Barbarity, they were in, long before his Reign? Where are then the Fruits of his Labour? I could not find that this Prince had changed the Genius of his Nation, and I had but too much Experience of the contrary.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Peter</HI> I. has been often heard to &s;ay, That he had made Men of Bea&s;ts; but that after his Death, they would turn to Bea&s;ts again; and the Author of the&s;e Letters &s;eems to ju&s;tify his Prophecy.</NOTE></P>
<P>From the&s;e Thoughts, coming to the U&s;age I had met with, the mo&s;t injurious that could be imagined, I began to make other Reflections. The Government of <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> (&s;aid I) ought, for &s;e|veral
<PB N="29" REF="262">
Rea&s;ons, to be looked upon as one of the principal Employments conferred by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Court.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Kingdom of <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> is one of the ten Governments, into which <HI>Peter</HI> I. parcel'd out his va&s;t <HI>Empire.</HI> He fir&s;t di|vided it into eight only, of which the Kingdoms of <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> and <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> together made one: But upon enlarging his Con|que&s;ts otwards <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the&s;e two Kingdoms were &s;eparated, and made two Governments, which made them nine in all, and he afterwards divided the two into three, in Order to make ten Governments; in Veneration to the Number Ten; (as it is &s;aid) that Number being held &s;acred by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians.</HI></NOTE> Con&s;equently the Per&s;on, who now en|joys it, &s;hould be e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t wor|thy Subjects belonging to it. And yet this Man, who is &s;tamped with &s;uch a Character, behaves him&s;elf in the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable Manner in the World. He has neither Chri&s;tianity, nor even any Principle of Humanity. He is the mo&s;t vile and ungenerous of Men: In a Word, he is a very <HI>Barbarian.</HI> Has not he &s;hewn him&s;elf to be the mo&s;t abandoned of the human Species, with Re|gard to me? Where is the Ju&s;tice of impri&s;oning a Foreigner, who, relying upon the Laws of Na|tions, travels under a feigned Name, and in whom there does not appear the lea&s;t Cau&s;e of Su&s;picion? Is it a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> U&s;age, to force a Man to travel in a Sea&s;on, in which a <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> who is the mo&s;t inured to Hard&s;hip, is obliged to keep his Home? Ought not he to have enquired, whether I was provided with Nece&s;&s;aries to re&s;i&s;t the Inclemen|cies of a hard Winter, in a Climat I was no Ways accu&s;tomed to? Was it not a Cruelty to abandon me in a Pri&s;on, without ever informing, him&s;elf if I had where withal to &s;ub&s;i&s;t? He knew I was ignorant of the Language of the Country; I was not capable of asking for what I &s;tood mo&s;t in need of. Ought he not, by his Orders, to have pre|vented my being robbed of Part of what I had? In &s;hort, Sir, would it not have excited your Com|pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="30" REF="263">
pa&s;&s;ion, to have &s;een me going over the <HI>Wolga?</HI> And if I had peri&s;hed in that Pa&s;&s;age, had not the Governour of <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> been the Cau&s;e of my Death? I cannot but look upon this Event as the mo&s;t dangerous I ever encountered with, during the whole Cour&s;e of my Life.</P>
<P>But to go father: To whom is it this Gover|nour &s;hews &s;uch unworthy Treatment? Why, to a Man of Quality, one whom he him&s;elf has ac|knowledged to be &s;o, and pitied him in his Mi&s;|fortunes. A Per&s;on, who, with a &s;incere and open Heart, throws him&s;elf into his Power, and en|treats his Protection. That he might the better &s;urprize and betray me, he begins, by giving me good Words, he a&s;&s;ures me I have nothing to fear, and that he will procure me an Opportunity of pur|&s;uing my Journey, in all Safety. Weak, ungene|rous Action! Tell me, I be&s;eech you, was there no other Way to &s;ecure me but by Treachery? In any other Country, a little more civiliz'd, a Go|vernour of a Province would have behaved in a very different Manner. He would have &s;aid; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, I am &s;orry I cannot grant you the Favour you a&s;k, the pre&s;ent Juncture, and the po&s;itive Orders I have from Court, oblige me indi&s;pen|&s;ably to &s;ecure your Per&s;on: However, be a&s;|&s;ured, I will do every thing, that is in my Power, to relieve you, and make your Captivity ea&s;y."</Q> Had the Governour of <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> treated me with &s;uch Language, he would no le&s;s have executed the Orders of his Court, &s;uppo&s;ing he had any: And for me, far from having Rea&s;on of Complaint, I &s;hould certainly have acknowledg|ed his Favours: But this is not their Manner of Proceeding in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> Their Way there is to &s;eize a Per&s;on without any Cau&s;e, without any Ex|amination, and, without even alledging the lea&s;t Pretext for it; they treat him immediately as a

State-Criminal, he is guarded within View, and with Sword in Hand, he is refu&s;ed the U&s;e of his Knife and Fork, and his Equipage is rifled. Can a People, who behave in this Manner, be called ci|vilized? And who then are <HI>Barbarians,</HI> if they are not &s;o? Certainly, if I had fallen into the Hands of <HI>Mur&s;a,</HI> the Chief of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who dwells in <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> I &s;hould never have met with &s;uch Treatment: And yet the&s;e pa&s;s for <HI>Barbari|ans,</HI> and no one has yet been at the Pains to un|deceive the World in this Point. There is an enormous Difference between them and the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites;</HI> but it con&s;i&s;ts in this, that they are not guilty of the Vices, the latter are &s;o ju&s;tly re|proached with. The very Sight of the <HI>Tartars</HI> inclines one to believe all that Fame tells us of tho&s;e noble Enterprizes, by Means of which they extended their Conque&s;ts throughout all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and a Part of <HI>Europe.</HI> But at this Time, by the greate&s;t of all Misfortunes, &s;everal Branches of this valiant Nation are brought under the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Yoke. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, this &s;urpa&s;&s;es my Under|&s;tanding, and I am at a Lo&s;s to comprehend it. It is true, the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> &s;hew a great Regard for them, which is one Rea&s;on why they are &s;o ea&s;y: But as they are not born to creep to &s;uch Ma&s;ters, I hardly que&s;tion but they will, &s;oon or late, &s;hake off their Yoke.</P>
<P>You will judge, Sir, of the Length of the Night, by that of my Reflections: But, at length Day appears, and I mu&s;t ri&s;e to pur&s;ue my Way, to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> in a Sea&s;on, when the Ground is eve|ry where covered with Snow. We had a pretty good Journey, this Day, chiefly thro Woods and By-ways. I was obliged to lie all along in my Sled, to avoid the Branches of the Trees: But then I was almo&s;t buried in the Snow, which was every Moment falling upon me. We came, in
<PB N="32" REF="265">
in the Evening, to a Village, the Hou&s;es of which appeared to me very different from tho&s;e of the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> Both Men and Women had other Habits, and their Language bore no Analogy to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian.</HI> Upon Enquiry, I found I was among the <HI>Scherimi&s;&s;ian Tartars,</HI> and I rejoiced at it. The Character I had heard of this Nation, and what I had ob&s;erved my&s;elf of them, while at <HI>Ca|&s;an,</HI> gave me an advantageous Idea of them. I took great Delight in viewing their Hou&s;es and Furniture, but more e&s;pecially the Dre&s;s of their Women, which is very &s;ingular.</P>
<P>While I was diverting my&s;elf in this Manner, I had the Di&s;&s;atisfaction, to &s;ee my Guard &s;cuffling with my Landlady. The&s;e Ra&s;cals had their Views, in taking this Way, which is not the com|mon Road. The mo&s;t brutal among them began to abu&s;e the poor old Creature, for no other Crime but endeavouring to &s;ecure her own. I thought it my Duty to &s;tand by this Woman: I therefore wre&s;ted a large Pole out of the Hands of a Soldier, who had &s;eized it, and, what with Signs and Words, had the good Fortune to appea&s;e him. I found, how|ever, that the poor <HI>Scheremi&s;&s;i,</HI> had been obliged to treat the&s;e Soldiers, and to furni&s;h them with what|ever they asked. For my Part, I was contented with a &s;mall Matter, conformable to the Bill of Fare I had pre&s;cribed my &s;elf for the whole Journey. It may be proper to inform you, that, in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> there are no Hou&s;es of Entertainment, where a Man may lodge and be boarded. In the Publick Hou&s;es they have, they only &s;ell Beer and Brandy. Ha|ving therefore thrown down &s;ome Money on the Table, I made a Sign for them to get me &s;ome Eggs, They took but one Penny, for which they brought me thirty. I began to laugh at &s;eeing &s;o large a Number for &s;o little Money. I picked out &s;ix of the fre&s;he&s;t, and gave the re&s;t to my Landlady.
<PB N="33" REF="266">
One of my greedy Guard would have laid hold on them; but I gave him to under&s;tand, by a Sign, that he was already well enough &s;erved. My whole Supper con&s;i&s;ted of the&s;e &s;ix Eggs, and a little Brandy mixed with Water. I might have had Beer, but it was &s;o bad, there was no drinking it. This was all my Food from <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> and this Way of Living was &s;o far from impairing my Health, that I was perfectly well, at my Arri|val there. My Bedding was as mean as my Food; a Bench was the only Conveniency offer'd me, and all a Traveller has to expect throughout whole <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> I had happily provided my &s;elf, before my Departure, with a good Mattra&s;s, which was of &s;ingular U&s;e to me, as well now as afterwards.</P>
<P>We continued our Journey, the next Morning. My Guard, who&s;e chief Views were Pillage, were for putting up at Noon: I plainly &s;aw their De|&s;ign; But did not know how to prevent it. How|ever, con&s;idering how much this retarded my Jour|ney, I took the Serjeant a&s;ide, and endeavoured, by good Words, to convince him, that this Be|haviour of his Men, might be the Occa&s;ion of a Riot. My Admonition produced no great Effect; he alledged &s;ome poor Rea&s;ons, in their Ju&s;tifica|tion, which I was obliged to put up with. I had every Day the Mortification to &s;ee the&s;e Free-boot|ers go from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and pillage the poor <HI>Tartars,</HI> of what they plea&s;ed. I thought, never|thele&s;s, it was my Bu&s;ine&s;s to proceed warily, in Ca&s;e of any Tumult. I had Rea&s;on to be appre|hen&s;ive, that the enraged <HI>Tartars</HI> might attempt to ma&s;&s;acre my Guard, together with their Pri&s;on|er. I therefore, concluded, that if any Di&s;tur|bance happened, the mo&s;t prudent Mea&s;ures I could take, would be to join with the &s;tronge&s;t Party. I never &s;uffered my Sword, which was my only Defence, to be out of my Sight. To gain the
<PB N="34" REF="267">
Affection of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> I never went into any Hou&s;e, but I gave the Children Money; and as I had made a large Provi&s;ion of white Bread, I was very free in di&s;tributing Pieces of it among them; for which I always had their Thanks. My Guard, tho very &s;tupid, had Cunning enough to pa&s;s by the larger Villages, that they might pillage with the le&s;s Danger.</P>
<P>This Behaviour of theirs gave Occa&s;ion to many Reflections, which I made during my Journey. I could not forbear lamenting my Fate, to be put in|to the Hands of the&s;e Robbers. A thou&s;and Times I cur&s;ed the Governor for committing me to the Care of &s;uch Wretches. When I ob&s;erved what mi&s;erable Di&s;cipline they were under, I &s;aid to my &s;elf:
<Q><L>Quid Domini &s;acient, audent cum talia Servi!</L></Q></P>
<P>It was a melancholy State I was reduced to, and I could not reflect upon it, without extream Con|cern. I found my &s;elf obliged to traver&s;e a Country almo&s;t unknown, drawn upon a Board in the mid&s;t of the Snow, dre&s;&s;ed like a Savage, and de&s;titute, in this De&s;art, of wherewithal to eat or drink. The three Soldiers, who were my Companions, were Men without Manners or Humanity, nor could I ever have any Conver&s;ation with them. I &s;ome|times however di&s;pelled the&s;e gloomy Ideas with a <HI>&s;ic erat in &s;atis.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit informing you, that, in this Journey, I once quarrelled with my Sled-driver.</P>
<P>This &s;mall Adventure will contribute not a little to give you a ju&s;t Idea of the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> The Ra&s;cal, for he de&s;erves no better Name, took a Delight in giving every one of the poor <HI>Scheremi&s;&s;i</HI> he met, a good La&s;h with his Whip. I thought, at fir&s;t, it would &s;uffice to let him know it di&s;|plea&s;ed
<PB N="35" REF="268">
me, and that he would then leave it: But my Admonitions were in vain, and my Patience being, at length, quite &s;pent, I gave him a Blow with my Fi&s;t, that beat him off the Sled. In his Ju&s;ti|fication, he pretended to convince me, that the&s;e People were no <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> Here had been a good Opportunity to read him a Le&s;&s;on of Morality: But then, on the one Hand, I mu&s;t have known how to explain my &s;elf to him, and, on the other, he mu&s;t have been indued with &s;ome Principles of Religion; a Thing very rare among the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ince I am &s;peaking of Religion, you mu&s;t know, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> think they alone have a Title to the Name of <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> They look upon all other People, the <HI>Europeans</HI> not excepted, to be I|dolaters, who have no Knowledge of the true God. <HI>Qualibus in tenebris vitae.</HI> Wretches that they are! They are not &s;en&s;ible of the profound Ignorance, in which they them&s;elves are immerged. What a &s;trange Wor&s;hip is theirs! How imperfect their Faith! How loo&s;e their Manners! I &s;peak more e&s;pecially of tho&s;e, who are in the highe&s;t Po&s;ts, and who ought to &s;et an Example to others. But to conclude my Reflections on this Head, &s;uffer me only to enquire what their Monks are. This Spe|cies of Men, who &s;warm in every Province, are generally Drunkards, who live in a criminal Sloth|fulne&s;s, giving them&s;elves up to all Manner of Vi|ces. Super&s;tition abounds no where more than in their Convents. Their Vows of Continence are a Crime, becau&s;e they never live up to them. They think of nothing but living at their Ea&s;e, without Labour or Care, and they immure them&s;elves with|in the Walls of their Convents only to e&s;cape Fa|mine, or going to the Army. When I have fre|quently a&s;ked to what End this Number of Slug|gards, the An&s;wer has always been, their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to pray to <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="269">
This is the Character of the Monks, and of the whole Body of the Clergy in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> If the&s;e Hypocrites, who pretend to Sanctity, had any Zeal for Religion, would they &s;uffer idolatrous Na|tions as the&s;e <HI>Scheremi&s;&s;i</HI> are, who inhabit the very Center of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empire, to live among them? It is true, the Clergy would be obliged to change their Manners, before they could pretend to preach the Go&s;pel, or they would run a great Hazard not to make a &s;ingle Convert. All the&s;e <HI>Pagans</HI> live in an hone&s;t Simplicity, and conformable to tho&s;e Laws which Nature has dictated to all Men. And cer|tainly, they would be very little inclined to give Ear to Men, who lead a Life perfectly &s;candalous. I fear, Sir, you will think this Digre&s;&s;ion tedious: But the Subject has carried me in&s;en&s;ibly beyond the Bounds I had pre&s;cribed my &s;elf. I might &s;ay a great deal more on this Head,

<P>Suppo&s;e me ju&s;t arrived at a Village, called <HI>Sa|baczar,</HI> which was formerly the Capital of the Pro|vince, where having bought &s;ome Provi&s;ions, with a Covering for my Sled, and a Sack to put my Feet in,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a Cu&s;tom, in the&s;e, and other Northern Parts, to travel with a large Sack lined with Furr, into which they put their Legs, and drawing it up, tie it about their Mid|dles.

The Per&s;ons I employed to buy the&s;e Things, did not forget them&s;elves. Not &s;atisfied with the Pre|&s;ent I made them, they kept Part of the Money I put into their Hands. I accu&s;ed them of the Theft, but I might as well have &s;poken to deaf Men: And be&s;ides, it is not cu&s;tomary, in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> to return Change.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="270">
It was &s;ome Comfort to me, under my Afflic|tions, that the&s;e People did me the Office of Ser|vants; I was more their Superior and Ma&s;ter than their Pri&s;oner. I had always the good Fortune, to keep up a Sort of Authority over my Guard, and all I had any Concern with, from the Beginning to the End of my Captivity. Upon &s;ome Occa&s;ions I treated them har&s;hly, and at other Times, I was as gentle as a Lamb. Happy for me, that I began, in Time, to bring them under my Yoke; I might otherwi&s;e have been doubly their Slave.

My la&s;t gave you an Account of my Arrival at <HI>Mu&s;cow.</HI> I was fir&s;t carried to the Hou&s;e of a Baker, till the Serjeant and one of the Soliders went to give an Account of my being there. The Soldier who was left, in&s;tead of following his Or|ders, to have a watchful Eye over me, laid him|&s;elf down upon an Oven, and &s;lept mo&s;t pro|foundly. You mu&s;t know, in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> the Hou&s;es of the meaner Sort of People, con&s;i&s;t generally of one large Room only, which &s;erves them for Cham|ber, Kitchen, and every other Occa&s;ion. In this Room you find an Oven, in which they bake their Bread, Meat, and almo&s;t all their Eatables, &s;o that it is kept very hot all the Year round. The Top of it is covered with a great Number of Boards, which form a Sort of &s;quare Scaffold; upon which the whole Family almo&s;t continually lives, as well in Summer as Winter. I have &s;ome|times happened to lay my Hand upon it, but found it &s;o hot, that I was &s;oon obliged to take it away. Some natural Philo&s;ophers of your Ac|quaintance, who have made &s;o many curious Ex|periments concerning <HI>Salamanders,</HI> did not per|haps know, that &s;o peculiar a Species of them was to be found in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> It is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that if they had made this Di&s;covery, they would have allowed tho&s;e Animals the Property given them, by the mo&s;t early of the Ancients, of liv|ing in Fire. Pray a&s;&s;ure tho&s;e Gentlemen, that the <HI>Salamanders</HI> in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> not only pa&s;s almo&s;t all their Time, but eat, &s;leep and perform eve|ry Office of Life, in that Element.</P>
<P>Nothing would have been more ea&s;y, than for me to have e&s;caped, while my <HI>Salamander</HI> was a|&s;leep on the Oven; and could I have fore&s;een what was to en&s;ue, I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hould not have neg|lected the Opportunity. In a City &s;o full of Strang|ers as <HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> is, I might ea&s;ily have been con|cealed

in the Crowd, and have freed my &s;elf from the Pur&s;uit of my Enemies: But I was &s;o far from having the lea&s;t Thought of it, that I looked up|on all that had happened to me till then, as a Farce, which would end with my Arrival at <HI>Petersburg.</HI> The fir&s;t Scene which was opened at <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> was humorous enough, but that which followed was as tragical: But you &s;hall be judge of them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Serjeant returned, I was conveyed to <HI>Cremelin</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kreml,</HI> or <HI>Cremmelin,</HI> is the innermo&s;t of the four Towns or Parts, into which the City of <HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> is divided, and in|circle one another. It contains the Palace of the <HI>Czars</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> an ancient Building, which is &s;aid to contain 1687 Apartments, including Cellars and Magazines; as likewi&s;e the Cathedral, and five other Churches. It is not the Pa|lace of the <HI>Czars</HI> alone, which is called <HI>Cremmelin,</HI> as &s;ome Writers &s;uppo&s;e, but this whole Town or Divi&s;ion, of which the Palace is but Part.</NOTE> the Re&s;idence of the <HI>Czars,</HI> I was not unea&s;y that the fir&s;t Scene was opened in a Place, where &s;uch tragical Pieces have been repre|&s;ented. This Building con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal enormous Piles, heaped upon one another, without any Or|der. I was carried into a large Hall, which they call the Palace or Civil Court, but is one of the mo&s;t filthy Places in the World. I there found a great Number of Clerks, bu&s;ied in di&s;patching a Crowd of People, who were round about them. My coming in put an immediate &s;top to their La|bour, and the Eyes of every one were turned upon me. As the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are &s;worn Enemies to the re&s;t of Mankind, the Sight of a Foreign Pri&s;oner was a Diver&s;ion to them, and the Hall was &s;oon frequented in a more than ordinary Manner.</P>
<P>I was committed to the Care of an Officer, a Corporal and &s;ix old Soldiers. One of them &s;tood always before me, with his Sword drawn, but he had not the mo&s;t terrifying Countenance. At length, they brought &s;ome of my Goods, but I &s;aw neither my Sword nor my Trunk. They &s;hewed
<PB N="41" REF="274">
me one Corner of the Hall, which was de&s;tined for my Pri&s;on: But I had no &s;ooner begun to pre|pare my Lodging, than a Per&s;on appeared at the Gate, to inform my Guard that I had a Pair of Sci&s;&s;ars about me. They immediately &s;et about to vi&s;it a little Bag, into which I had put &s;uch Things as were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary on my Journey, and upon my oppo&s;ing them, they called the Officer, who told me he had Orders to vi&s;it every Thing I had. I then opened the Bag my &s;elf, and in a Moment they &s;eized the Sci&s;&s;ars, which they found there. I endeavoured to convince them, that I could not do without them, that I &s;hould make no ill U&s;e of them, and that they need not fear my making my &s;elf an Eunuch with them. None of the&s;e Arguments had any Effect, &s;o I was obliged to give way to Force. By good Fortune, I had another Pair of Sci&s;&s;ars which e&s;caped their Notice. I had, likewi&s;e, a large Fork, which, upon Oc|ca&s;ion, would have done the Service of a Dagger; for the lea&s;t terrifying Weapons are more than &s;ufficient to affright a <HI>Mu&s;covite.</HI></P>
<P>So excellent a Beginning gave me Room to judge what I had to expect in the Sequel; I, there|fore, endeavoured to make my &s;elf ea&s;y under the State I was in. My greate&s;t Mortification was to &s;ee my &s;elf expo&s;ed as a Sight to Crowds of Peo|ple, who were continually flocking into the Hall. I &s;hould have been very glad of an Interpreter; but all the Application I made for that End was in vain, nor could I, with all my Entreaties, pre|vail upon them to let me have a Barber. Dinner-Time approaching, I made Signs for &s;omething to eat, and was an&s;wered, in the &s;ame Manner, that I mu&s;t open my Pur&s;e. After long waiting, and &s;ee|ing nothing appear, I was obliged to be content with a Mor&s;el of Bread, and &s;ome Scraps which I had yet left in my Hamper. While I was at Din|ner,
<PB N="42" REF="275">
they a&s;ked me for the Key of my Trunk, which they had not thought fit to entru&s;t to my Care. I thought it &s;omething &s;trange, that they &s;hould ran&s;ack my Trunk out of my Sight; how|ever, I gave them the Key, tho with Reluctance. At Supper-Time, I was obliged to have Recour&s;e to my Pocket, and upon this Occa&s;ion I found, that Stewards at <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> are greater Thieves than tho&s;e of <HI>Ca&s;an.</HI> You will not need to ask me what Sort of a Bed I had, I believe, I have already told you, that they lye on Benches, in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> I was &s;o happy to have Sheets, and Coverlets, of my own, which did me good Service: But what a Surprize appeared in my Guard, when they &s;aw me making my Bed! They could not conceive what I was go|ing to do with tho&s;e Bed-Cloaths.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Sir, I keep my Word with you: It was your Command, that I &s;hould inform you of the mo&s;t minute Circum&s;tances, and you have no Cau&s;e to complain on that Score. Since then you have a Ta&s;te that Way, you &s;hall know &s;ome Particulars of what happened the next Day. I was di&s;turbed, very early, at my Toilet, by the &s;ame Troop of Clerks, I mentioned above, and a great Number of other People, whom Curio&s;ity or Bu&s;ine&s;s had drawn together, in the Hall. I continued expo&s;ed as a Sight to the&s;e Crowds, who could not forbear fixing their Eyes upon me. At Length, I began to think of making Advantage of this Concour&s;e of People. When I &s;aw any one come in, who had a good Ap|pearance, or who &s;eemed to be an Officer or Fo|reigner, I immediately acco&s;ted him, &s;peaking in <HI>Italian, French</HI> or <HI>Latin:</HI> But it was all in vain, I did not find one who could under&s;tand me. My Guard, in the mean Time, offended at the Free|dom I took, pretended to impo&s;e Silence upon me; but I gave them to under&s;tand, by Signs, that they mu&s;t cut out my Tongue, if they would debar me
<PB N="43" REF="276">
the U&s;e of it. Two <HI>Poles</HI> coming in, I addre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf to them in <HI>Latin,</HI> and they began to an&s;wer me, but their Mouths were &s;oon &s;topped. Their Silence did not, however, hinder me from asking them, if it was cu&s;tomary, in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> to treat Pri&s;oners as the mo&s;t abject Slaves? If it was u&s;ual to let them peri&s;h for Hunger, by denying them an Interpreter? And, finally, if, &s;ince <HI>Peter</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> had o|bliged the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Peter</HI> I, obliged all his Subjects, by an Edict, to cut off their Beards, and to wear &s;hort Cloathing, which Edict was the Occa&s;ion of a Rebellion, in 1704 in the Kingdom of <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> and the adjacent Countries.</NOTE> to cut off their Beards, there was no &s;uch Thing as a Barber e&s;tabli&s;hed in that City?</P>
<P>While I was di&s;cour&s;ing with the&s;e <HI>Poles,</HI> the Man who had been &s;o anctious about my Sci&s;&s;ars, came in, and made me a Sign to follow him. Be|ing per&s;uaded that he was to carry me before the Governour, I readily obeyed; for I longed for no|thing more, being in Hopes he might under&s;tand &s;ome of the Languages I knew. I was carried into an Apartment, not far from the Hall, where I found one &s;ingle Man only; but &s;oon after came in another, with &s;ome Papers in his Hands. This latter pa&s;&s;ed by me without &s;aluting, or &s;o much as looking on me, and &s;ate down near a Table, to|wards which I likewi&s;e advanced. The Per&s;on I &s;aw fir&s;t did the &s;ame, and having asked me if I &s;poke <HI>Italian,</HI> I an&s;wered him, it was natural for me to &s;peak my Mother Tongue. He then, after ha|ving received the In&s;tructions of the Per&s;on who was &s;itting, asked me, who I was? But before I an&s;wered him, I was inqui&s;itive, in my Turn, who it was that was examining me? I was told he was a Secretary, I was not a little &s;urprized to &s;ee a Se|cretary examining me &s;itting, while I was &s;tanding; but being apprehen&s;ive I might be &s;ent back from
<PB N="44" REF="277">
whence I came, I told him my Name, which he wrote down. He asked me &s;everal other frivolous Que&s;tions, by which I found my Examination was not like to be &s;hort. I, therefore, took the Re&s;oluti|on to tell him, that if he expected any farther An|&s;wer from me, he mu&s;t order me a Chair. He lifted up his Head, in a great Surprize, and looking me in the Face, continued his Interrogations. All the An&s;wer I gave was, that I would not &s;peak &s;tand|ing. He &s;eemed terribly perplexed, and I found he had not been accu&s;tomed to &s;uch Replies; he was obliged, however, to give Way to them. Being &s;eated, I was forced to give An&s;wer to a Number of the mo&s;t impertinent Que&s;tions in the World: And what was particular, there were, be&s;ides the Soldier who guarded me, Sword in Hand, twenty other Per&s;ons in the Room: A peculiar Manner of examining Pri&s;oners of State. As &s;oon as the Se|cretary let me know, I might retire, I bid the In|terpreter tell him, I de&s;ired to &s;peak with the Go|vernour, and that I expected to be treated as Per|&s;ons of Quality are treated throughout all <HI>Europe.</HI> All the An&s;wer he vouch&s;afed me was, that he did not know whether I was &s;o or not. Enraged to the utmo&s;t at this An&s;wer, I told him he had very little Skill in Phy&s;iognomy; and I would gladly have added, that having a better Knowledge of Men than he, I could foretel him that the Gallows would &s;oon be his Fate. He had indeed a very hanging Look, and my Prophecy would hardly have been mi&s;pla|ced. I leave you to judge, whether he did not de|&s;erve, at lea&s;t, that Fate, by his Carriage to me.</P>
<P>The next Day, I was again obliged to appear be|fore Mr. Secretary; who took Care to put it out of my Power, to in&s;i&s;t upon being &s;eated, by ordering all the Chairs to be conveyed out of the Room. This was &s;o far from exciting my Anger, that it put me into a good Humour; and I was very near
<PB N="45" REF="278">
imitating the Per&s;on, who for want of a Chair, &s;ate down upon his Cloak. I no &s;ooner came into the Room, than the Interpreter read a Paper to me, containing the Examination of the foregoing Day, and I was directed to &s;ign it. I an&s;wered I would never &s;et my Hand to a Writing, in a Language I did not under&s;tand. The Reply was, it is the Cu&s;tom of the Country; if it be &s;o, &s;aid I, it is a very &s;candalous one; and, indeed, &s;uppo&s;ing I had been as criminal as they pretended, it would have been contrary to all Law, to condemn me on &s;uch an Evidence. The Secretary in&s;i&s;ted upon my &s;ign|ing it, I oppo&s;ed it for &s;ome Time, alledging &s;uch Rea&s;ons as might have convinced him of his Igno|rance, and how little I valued the&s;e Proceedings: However, at length, &s;eeing no other Way to get out of his Clutches, I con&s;ented. I asked him, if he had let the Governour know I de&s;ired to be ad|mitted to his Pre&s;ence; he &s;aid he had. I likewi&s;e de&s;ired him, if I was to be detained any Time at <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> that he would endeavour to procure me another Pri&s;on, that in which I was, being very un|be&s;eeming a Pri&s;oner of State; he &s;aid he would &s;peak about it. To conclude, at leaving him, I let him know, I &s;hould be very glad to have a Bar|ber; to which he replied, it was Time enough for that; an An&s;wer worthy of a Secretary of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> in Return for which, I ought to have &s;pit in his Face. The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are &s;till &s;o enraged, that <HI>Peter</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> obliged them to cut off their Beards, that not daring to have them them&s;elves, they will o|blige Strangers to let theirs grow. It is, likewi&s;e, a Cu&s;tom, that as &s;oon as a Man is accu&s;ed of any Crime, he does not touch his Beard afterwards, but affects a &s;uppliant Air, to excite Compa&s;&s;ion in his Judges. Perhaps the&s;e Gentlemen thought to make me conform to this Cu&s;tom, and in one Re&s;pect they had there Will, becau&s;e I never could get a
<PB N="46" REF="279">
Barber: But they did not gain &s;o much over me, to make me appear before them as a Suppliant.</P>
<P>I expected I &s;hould have been &s;ent away, that Day, or the next, for <HI>Peter&s;burg;</HI> but they are rarely &s;o expeditious, in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> They let me pa&s;s the Remainder of the Day, very peaceably, without offering me any Thing to eat. I was o|bliged to provide at my own Expence, and to &s;ee my &s;elf robbed, with Impunity, by tho&s;e who&s;e Care it was to buy my Provi&s;ions. I believe, I have told you already, Sir, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are very great Thieves: But I had almo&s;t forgot to let you know, that, at my Meals, I was forced to be contented with two Spoons, in&s;tead of a Knife and Fork. This manner of treating Pri&s;oners in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> gave me often an Opportunity of je&s;ting with the Soldi|ers, and tho&s;e who were about me, tho I under&s;tood very little of their Language.</P>
<P>The Governour did not de&s;ire to &s;ee me till the 27th, and then more out of Curio&s;ity, than any o|ther Motive. When I was introduced to him, he was &s;itting with two others, at a great Table, with his Back to the Door, I came in at: And, when I drew near him, he continued &s;till in the &s;ame Po|&s;ture, being contented with turning his Head, and looking at me over his Shoulder. He immediately or|dered the <HI>Italian</HI> Interpreter, who was pre&s;ent, to a&s;k me &s;everal Que&s;tions. As for his two Companions, I could not perceive they &s;o much as moved, or once turned their Eyes towards me. Having an|&s;wered the Governour's Que&s;tions, I bid the Inter|preter tell him, I could hardly believe it was with his Knowledge, I was treated in a Manner &s;o little becoming my Quality; that I begged of him he would allot me another Pri&s;on, for that I could have no Re&s;t where I was, and be&s;ides, was expo&s;ed to be the Scoff of the whole Town. Upon which he &s;poke to the Secretary, but I could not under&s;tand
<PB N="47" REF="280">
any thing he &s;aid. To di&s;mi&s;s me, he at length gave me a gracious Nod; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is plain, our Author had not traveled much among the <HI>Northern</HI> Grandees, who are &s;o u&s;ed to treat their Va&s;|&s;als in this Manner, that they are very apt to forget them|&s;elves, and treat others, and &s;ometimes their Equals, with this familiar Nods. And that not in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> only.</NOTE> But as I did not &s;eem to under&s;tand the&s;e api&s;h Tricks, he was con&s;train|ed, at length, to tell me, by the Mouth of the In|terpreter, that I mu&s;t retire. And thus ended this formal Appearance, which I was forced to make before the Governour of the Great City of <HI>Mu&s;cow.</HI> I do not doubt but you have &s;een the Play called <HI>Ar|lichin finto Prencipe.</HI> Imagine, you &s;ee me received much with the &s;ame Grimaces, as <HI>Harlequin</HI> receives his People with, and that the Di&s;cour&s;e which pa&s;&s;ed was not much unlike that of the Illu&s;trious Buffoon, I have ju&s;t mentioned. The Farce which followed, did not in the lea&s;t deviate from the Ab&s;urdity of that which preceeded it. But I mu&s;t give you a Skitch of it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Evening, they carried me to another Pri&s;on; which was a Piece of antient Ruins, that &s;erved as a Shelter for tho&s;e People who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it was to break the Ice, and to clean&s;e the Streets from Snow and Dirt. In this Pri&s;on was a little Room, which was allotted for me, my Guard of 6 or 7 Soldiers, and 3 or 4 Du&s;t (or rather Dirt) men, who had already taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This Change, which I was to take as a Favour too, &s;urprized me &s;trangely; but my Wonder &s;oon cea&s;ed, when I was informed, that Signor <HI>Harlequin</HI> him&s;elf had ordered it. I placed my &s;elf as conveniently as I could, in a Corner, where, during the whole Time I was for|ced to &s;tay there, I was almo&s;t &s;uffocated with Smoke and Heat. While I was in this Dungeon, a little Adventure happened to me, which may make you laugh. One Day, not knowing how to em|ploy my Time, it came into my Head to clean my Teeth: But as I had neglected it a long while, I
<PB N="48" REF="281">
could not do it without making my Gums bleed. My Guard, the mo&s;t &s;tupid of Human Species, were very attentive to what I was doing, but, could not tell what to think of the Operation. After ha|ving frequently a&s;ked one another what it meant, they, at length, ventured to draw nearer, and ex|amine the In&s;truments I made u&s;e of. As I had &s;ome Steel-Pens, which probably they took for Launcets, and they &s;aw Blood, they endeavoured to hinder me. I laughed at their Stupidity, but I was forced to make a great many Signs, before I could prevail on them to let me go on. One Scene more, and then I &s;hall &s;hift the Decorations: But, unhappily for me, I &s;hall be obliged <HI>induere Co|thurnum.</HI></P>
<P>The 30th, which, if I mi&s;take not, is the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Andrew;</HI> I had a Vi&s;it again from my Sci&s;|&s;ars Merchant, in Company with another Per&s;on. They made a long Speech, in which I heard the Names of the Empre&s;s and the Governour menti|oned: But all that I could comprehend of it was, that they came to make me a Pre&s;ent; however, he who was Chief in the Commi&s;&s;ion, held it &s;o clo&s;e in his Hand, and kept at &s;uch a Di&s;tance, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to di&s;tingui&s;h what it con&s;i&s;ted of. At length drawing nearer towards him, I &s;ud|denly &s;eized his Hand, and found a &s;ingle Ruble in it. Far from vouch&s;afing to accept of &s;uch a Pre|&s;ent, I only thanked them, and &s;aid I never recei|ved Money of any body. One of my Guards &s;ur|prized to &s;ee me refu&s;e &s;o con&s;iderable a Pre&s;ent, drew near, and pu&s;hing me pretty roughly, cried, <HI>Take it, Take it, Fool that thou art.</HI> They pre&s;&s;ed me, to accept of it, but finding me ob&s;tinate in my Refu&s;al, they walked off with their Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Could you ever have imagined I &s;hould be re|duced to the Condition of having a Crown offered me? And do you think it po&s;&s;ible &s;uch a Pre&s;ent
<PB N="49" REF="282">
&s;hould be made, to a Per&s;on of my Birth, in the Name of the Empre&s;s of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI> It would be ridi|culous to believe this Offer was made me by Order from Her Maje&s;ty, and if it came from the Gover|nour, I leave you to judge of his Character.</P>
<P>The 2d of <HI>December,</HI> two Hours before Day, they came to tell me, I mu&s;t ri&s;e, and depart immediate|ly. It was to no Purpo&s;e to con&s;ider; they put me in&s;tantly into a Sled, without giving me Time to recollect, without any Regard to the Rigour of the Sea&s;on, and without allowing me to make nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ion for &s;uch a Journey. I was guarded by three Ra&s;cals, one of whom called him&s;elf a Sergeant, and the other two Soldiers, tho they had neither the Habit, nor Arms, nor any Thing el&s;e, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them as &s;uch. Before I went out, I asked for my Sword, which had di&s;appeared, and was told, it was locked up in my Trunk. Do not forget, I be&s;eech you, this Circum&s;tance; Becau&s;e it has &s;ome Relation to that of the Key of this &s;ame Trunk, of which I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak hereafter.</P>
<P>As we &s;topped in the <HI>Slaboda,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are two large <HI>Slabodas</HI> or Suburbs without the Mud-Wall which enclo&s;es all the four Towns or Divi&s;ions, that together make the whole City of <HI>Mu&s;cow.</HI> One of the&s;e is called the <HI>German,</HI> the other the <HI>Strelitz, Slaboda.</HI></NOTE> I took Care to furni&s;h my &s;elf there, with what was nece&s;&s;ary, that I &s;hould not have found el&s;ewhere. While I was thus employed, one of my Soldiers, who was upon Duty, with a great Scimitar in his Hand, had the A&s;&s;urance to in&s;ult, and talk &s;aucily to me. To pu|ni&s;h him for his In&s;olence, I immediately wre&s;ted a Stick out of the Hands of the Corporal, and offered to &s;trike him. This Shew of cha&s;tizing him was &s;ufficient to make him retreat ten Paces from me, and this Coward was afterwards the mo&s;t humble, and the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive of my Guard. The Bru|tality of the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> ought always to be reproved
<PB N="50" REF="283">
in this Manner. Shew your Teeth to the&s;e Cow|ardly Wretches, and you &s;oon have them creeping at your Feet.</P>
<P>When I left <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> I was in perfect Health; But, two Days after, I was &s;eized with a Di&s;tem|per, which I thought would have laid me in the Grave. It was a Sort of a Cholick in the Stomach, attended with intolerable Pain, convul&s;ive Motions, and a continual Propen&s;ity to vomit. You may judge in what a melancholy State I was then in, obliged to travel in a Sled, in the Depth of Winter, and de&s;titute of all Relief. The fir&s;t Stage we came at, I had immediate Recour&s;e to &s;ome Remedies I carried with me. I had <HI>Venice-Treacle,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Eau|des Carmes,</HI> and a certain Bal&s;am, which is account|ed an excellent Remedy, and is di&s;tributed by the Monks of St. <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> to their Friends, All the&s;e Remedies I applied in a Moment, without the lea&s;t Succe&s;s: My Di&s;temper continued, with an a&s;to|ni&s;hing Violence, and without the lea&s;t Intermi&s;&s;ion. From my Stomach, the Pains de&s;cended into my Bowels, my Convul&s;ions became more violent, and my Retchings to vomit increa&s;ed every Moment. In this &s;ad Extremity, in&s;tead of being quite di&s;pirit|ed, I thought it expedient to double the Do&s;e of my Medicines, but &s;till without receiving the lea&s;t Bene|fit by them. After having &s;uffered inexpre&s;&s;ible Torments, for 6 or 7 Hours together, I was &s;eized with the mo&s;t burning Thir&s;t, which obliged me to drink a prodigious Quantity of Water. My Pain continued with the &s;ame Violence, I had only a &s;mall Evacuation downwards.</P>
<P>The mi&s;erable Condition I was in, did not hin|der my Guard from propo&s;ing to depart. I was &s;orced to &s;ubmit to my De&s;tiny, and throw my &s;elf into the Arms of Providence. As I was devoured with Thir&s;t, I took &s;everal Bottles of Water before my Departure. I was often obliged to &s;top by the
<PB N="51" REF="284">
Way to ea&s;e Nature, and I always ob&s;erved that my Stools were of divers Colours, and that I voided Blood. To compleat the Misfortune, we had like all to have peri&s;hed, in the mo&s;t melancholy man|ner in the World. One Night, when we were cro&s;&s;ing the River <HI>Wolkowa,</HI> I &s;uddenly heard a loud Voice repeating three Times, <HI>Keep back:</HI> Upon Enquiry what was the Matter, we found, that two Sleds, and 8 Hor&s;es, laden with Money, were ju&s;t fallen in, at the very Place where we were. The Sled, in which my Goods were, run a great Hazard, being the foremo&s;t of our Train; but fortunately we had all Time to retreat, and afterwards took another Way.</P>
<P>But to return to my Illne&s;s; give me leave to make &s;ome Conjectures on that Head, which to me &s;eem but too well grounded, of which, however, I leave you to be the &s;ole Judge. My intent is to mark out to you the real Cau&s;e of &s;o fatal a Di&s;temper; and I firmly believe it to have been the Effect of Poi|&s;on given me. I &s;hall give you my Rea&s;ons for it, in the Sequel, in the mean Time, I de&s;ire you to give &s;ome Attention to the following Reflections. Before my Illne&s;s, I was of a hail robu&s;t Con&s;titu|tion, and at my Departure from <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> I was in a State of perfect Health. I did not know that I ever eat or drunk any Thing, that could be the Cau&s;e of &s;uch Symptoms: Nor is there any more Probability, that any Species of Poi&s;on &s;hould have accidentally been mixed with my Food. I cannot therefore, be per&s;uaded, but that my Guard, out of an execrable De&s;ign, them&s;elves endeavoured to take away my Life by Poi&s;on.</P>
<P>In the Night between the 14th and 15th I arrived, in a very piteous Condition, at a large Suburb, a|bout a Quarter of a League's Di&s;tance from <HI>Peter&s;|burg.</HI> The Hou&s;e where we took our Quarters had neither Eggs, nor any Thing el&s;e to eat, &s;o I was
<PB N="52" REF="285">
obliged to put up with a Piece of brown Bread, which I found upon the Table. I pa&s;&s;ed the whole Night under great Unea&s;ine&s;s, and without any Re&s;t, my Di&s;temper obliging me to get up every Moment.</P>
<P>Thus ended my painful Journey from <HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> to <HI>Peter&s;burg;</HI> where I hope to find all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance I &s;tand in need of, and, in a &s;hort Time, to &s;ee all my Misfortunes at an End. The&s;e Hopes are &s;o powerful, that methinks I am already, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, ea&s;ed of my Pain. What is your Opinion of it, Sir, do you believe I &s;hall find my &s;elf mi&s;ta|ken? I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I do not e&s;teem <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> as a City of <HI>Mu&s;covy:</HI> I look upon this Capital as the Re&s;idence of one of the mo&s;t mighty Monarchs in the whole World, crouded with Foreigners, the greater Part of whom have the Direction of the mo&s;t important Affairs. I expect &s;peedily to be lodged in a Palace, which is oppo&s;ite to that of the Sovereign, and in which the wi&s;e&s;t Mini&s;ters a&s;&s;em|ble. I flatter my &s;elf with the Hopes of being treat|ed there in &s;uch a Manner, that I &s;hall entirely lo&s;e the Remembrance of what is pa&s;t. Depend on it, Sir, I &s;hall not delay giving you an Account of eve|ry Thing, being per&s;uaded that you will expect it with the utmo&s;t Impatience;

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Cannot but acknowledge, with the ut|mo&s;t Gratitude, the many Obligations you lay me under. By your la&s;t, I per|ceive, that your Friend&s;hip to me en|crea&s;es daily; that you bemoan my Ab&s;ence; that you are &s;en&s;ibly affected with what ever befals me; and, in fine, that you pity my Misfortunes, which you wi&s;h to &s;ee &s;peedily ended. The&s;e lively Tokens of a Friend&s;hip the mo&s;t &s;incere, without Doubt me|rit a Retaliation from my Hands. Be a&s;&s;ured then, that you are to me the deare&s;t Per&s;on living, and that nothing can afford me &s;o much Comfort, in my pre&s;ent unhappy State, as the Hopes of embra|cing, &s;oon or late, &s;o valuable a Friend. You are plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that neither my Impri&s;onment, nor my Sufferings, have made me forget the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, and that you take a Plea&s;ure in the Peru&s;al of tho&s;e Ver&s;es, which I &s;ometimes quote in that Language. As you &s;eem, Sir, to reli&s;h this Way of Writing, I will not, in the Sequel, fail to give you that Satisfaction: And am only &s;orry, that I have not a Library at Command, for then I &s;hould find it more ea&s;y to &s;end you elegant <HI>Latin,</HI> than bad <HI>French.</HI> In the mean Time, as I am lo&s;t to all Ambition, &s;o neither am I in a Humour, to give my &s;elf the lea&s;t Trouble either for the one or the o|ther; if therefore my Letters are written in a cold, flagging Stile, you may freely &s;ay,

and if the Expre&s;&s;ions are low, and the Diction in|correct, I mu&s;t plead, as an Excu&s;e, that I'm a Stranger to the Language I write in. As you &s;eem fond of <HI>Latin,</HI> I mu&s;t beg Leave to tell you, that
<Q><L>De qua &s;cribebam barbara terra fuit.</L></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall begin my Account of this Country by tel|ling you, that we made our Entry into <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> on the 15th of <HI>December,</HI> 1733. A Thaw had made the Roads, at that Time, very deep, and, when we reached the River, which we were to pa&s;s, we were obliged to halt, no one being &s;uffered to cro&s;s it: Guards were even placed at all the mo&s;t frequented Pa&s;&s;es, to ob&s;truct the Pa&s;&s;age of Drunkards, which Appellation is generally due to half, and &s;ometimes to the whole City. After a &s;tay of two Hours, with|out knowing what my Fate would be, I was ordered to pa&s;s the River, and my Guard &s;hewed me on the oppo&s;ite Side a Hou&s;e, called the Senate-Hou&s;e, whither I was to go. I was really a&s;hamed of the Condition I found my &s;elf in, when I &s;tepped out of my Sled, and leave you to judge what a Figure I mu&s;t have made after what I had undergone. My Pa&s;&s;age over this River, &s;eemed in Compari&s;on with the Tri|al I had undergone in cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Wolga,</HI> only a plea&s;ant Step, through the Gravel-Walks of a Gar|den, or on an Arched Roof. I was no &s;ooner land|ed on the oppo&s;ite Banks, than the Soldiers, who were po&s;ted there, to &s;top up the Pa&s;&s;es, pre&s;ented their Bayonets, and enjoined me to return from whence I came. But upon the pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances of the Sergeant, who had accompanied me, I was at la&s;t permitted to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>They conducted me immediately to the Hall of the Senate-Hou&s;e, which was crowded with Per&s;ons of all Ranks. After having waited &s;ome Time
<PB N="55" REF="288">
there, I was led to another little Apartment, where I could hardly &s;tand upright, and informed by Signs that I mu&s;t take up my Habitation there. At the Remon&s;trance of the Soldiers, who were on Guard, I was however directed to a Chamber, where I found a Score of Clerks, five or &s;ix Soldiers, and Crowds of other People. No &s;ooner had I entered this Room, than an Officer pointed to a Corner, and &s;aid to me, <HI>There's thy Lodging.</HI> The manner with which he uttered the&s;e Words, &s;hewed he had a &s;e|cret Plea&s;ure in having an impri&s;oned Foreigner in his Cu&s;tody. He asked, whether I had any Mo|ney, for, if I had none, I &s;hould be &s;upplyed with Beer and Bread. If you was in my Ca&s;e, thought I with my &s;elf, you would fare very hard.</P>
<P>Being left to the Cu&s;tody of a Soldier, who guard|ed me, Sword in Hand, I lay down on my Mattre&s;s, to take a little Re&s;t. I was &s;o overwhelmed with Grief, that I was hardly capable of reflecting on the Situ|ation I was in. Some Slaves brought, at the &s;ame Time, my Goods, all but my Trunk, and what|ever el&s;e they thought proper to rob me of. At noon, every one retired, and I was left only with my Guard, who were of the Regiment of <HI>A&s;tracan.</HI> Soon after came in the Sergeant, who gave &s;ome Orders to my Guard, and I perceived I was to be under his In&s;pection. I let him know I wanted &s;omebody I could &s;peak to, having Occa&s;ion to buy &s;ome Victu|als. He promi&s;ed to grant my Reque&s;t the next Morning. But as I found, that the People of this Country &s;eemed unacquainted with the Proverb, <HI>Venter non patitur dilationem,</HI> I gave Money to one of the Soldiers to fetch me Bread and Wine, which he did. Having &s;ome Sugar, I made a Toa&s;t, and &s;weetned the Wine, which had been my greate&s;t Relief during the whole Journey.</P>
<P>At Day-Break, the next Morning, my Apart|ment was again, crowded with Clerks and other Peo|ple.
<PB N="56" REF="289">
The little Corner, where I was &s;treightned for want of Room, was the Anti-Chamber of a Secre|tary, who came in, and, having fixed his Eyes on me, in an in&s;olent Manner, pa&s;&s;ed by without &s;a|luting me. He went into his Office, and returned in&s;tantly, to order an Officer of the Guards, then pre&s;ent, not to &s;uffer me to be at the Window, or to go into the Secretary's Office. He kept his Hat on whil&s;t he gave the&s;e Orders to the Officer, to whom he &s;poke with an Air of Superiority that &s;ur|prized me. This Carriage occa&s;ioned me to think, that the Gentlemen, who are at the Head of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops, are probably ignorant, how they expo&s;e the Honour of their Regiments by &s;ubjecting them to the Injunctions of &s;uch Wretches.</P>
<P>I waited, in the mean Time, with great Impati|ence for the Interpreter, they had promi&s;ed me. I acquainted the Sergeant, who came to &s;ee me, with my De&s;ire, and he a&s;&s;ured me, that he would im|mediately &s;end me one. I met with the &s;ame An|&s;wer to my Demand for a Barber. But, notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e repeated A&s;&s;urances, I &s;aw neither one nor t'other. The Door of an adjoining Apart|ment being open, and no one there, my Curio&s;ity induced me to go in, but I was ordered to re|tire, and I was obliged to obey. I met with the &s;ame Order, when I approached a Window, but having little Regard to &s;uch Impertinences, I gave them to under&s;tand, that, if they would hinder me from looking out at the Windows, they mu&s;t wall them up. This An&s;wer put a Stop to all further Unea&s;ine&s;s on that Head. I pa&s;&s;ed the Night quiet|ly enough, but, when I waked, found my&s;elf benum'd from Head to Foot, and not able to &s;tir for &s;ome Time. This Accident revived the Su&s;picion, I en|tertained before, of being poi&s;oned: Which my&s;te|rious Scene of Iniquity, I &s;hall explain to you more at large, in the Sequel: at pre&s;ent I mu&s;t inform you of what pa&s;&s;ed at my Levee.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="290">
I was hardly up, when the Sergeant came into my Chamber, and de&s;ired me to prepare for going out. I was very &s;oon ready, and met, at the Bottom of the Stairs, a Secretary, who made Signs to me, to follow him: This Officer was to conduct me to the Empre&s;s's Palace, &s;ituate on the other Side of the River. Notwith&s;tanding that the Ice appeared to me very &s;trong, yet few were willing to pa&s;s over it: But a large Number of Planks were laid upon it which rendered the Pa&s;&s;age entirely &s;afe. When I came to the Palace, I was carried into an Anti-Chamber crowded with People. A Looking-Gla&s;s, which was in that Apartment, gave me an Opportu|nity of &s;eeing what a Figure I made: But I was highly mortified to find my &s;elf &s;o nearly re&s;embling a Savage. Another Object, which, at the &s;ame Time, offered it&s;elf to my View, &s;oon di&s;pelled this little Unea&s;ine&s;s. I &s;aw, the Sergeant, who had guarded me from <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> to <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> in a much wor&s;e Condition than my &s;elf. One would have thought this poor Wretch ju&s;t come from the Rack. I beg, Sir, you would not forget this Circum&s;tance, which I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to remind you of in the Sequel.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t my Mind was employed in forming Con|jectures about what might have happened to my Sergeant, I was &s;ent for to a &s;mall Apartment, where I &s;aw two Lords &s;itting at a Table, and at &s;ome Di&s;tance another Per&s;on likewi&s;e &s;itting, on a low Stool. The former were the two Prime-Mi|ni&s;ters of her <HI>Czarian</HI> Maje&s;ty; the one a Fo|reigner, and the other a <HI>Mu&s;covite;</HI> and the third, who &s;at at &s;ome Di&s;tance, was the Attorney-Gene|ral. I drew near to the Table as well as my Legs would let me; for they were &s;carce in a Con|dition to obey my Orders; <HI>Sed vires animus dabat.</HI> The Foreign Mini&s;ter, who is a Man of a noble Appearance, broke Silence, and asked me in <HI>French,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="291">
who I was. I acquainted him with my Name, and told him, at the &s;ame Time, how much I was a&s;ha|med to appear before him in &s;o mean a Condition. He then asked &s;ome other in&s;ignificant Que&s;tions, to which I an&s;wered as well as I could. An Ab&s;tract of the&s;e Interrogations, you will find in a Memorial, which I &s;hall take Care to &s;end you.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Mini&s;ter kept a profound Silence during the Conver&s;ation, I had with the other, and did not &s;o much as lift up his Eyes. He is a Man of an enormous Size, and wore a Peruke with a Bag, as remarkably &s;mall. The comical Figure, this di|minutive Peruke made on the Head of &s;o big a Man, was &s;uch, that on any other Occa&s;ion I &s;hould una|avoidibly have bur&s;t out into Laughter, and might ju&s;tly have applyed to him the&s;e Words, <HI>Atque &s;u|percilio brevior comoe.</HI> As for the Attorney-General, his Function &s;eemed to be no other, than that of hearing what was &s;aid. The Prime-Mini&s;ter con|tinued, in the mean Time, to examine me, and en|quired into the Motives, that induced me to leave <HI>France.</HI> I an&s;wered that it was to avoid a Marri|age, which I &s;hould have been obliged to contract, had I made any longer Stay in that Country. To this he an&s;wered, that I mu&s;t &s;urely be more &s;crupu|lous than People generally are in <HI>France,</HI> adding, the&s;e very Words: <HI>Sir, you might have married the Per&s;on, you &s;peak of, and need not have been de|&s;titute of Means to rid your &s;elf of her afterwards.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding my extream Weakne&s;s, at the&s;e Words, I retreated a Step or two backwards, &amp; <HI>hic vires indignatio dedit.</HI> He recollected him&s;elf, when he &s;aw the Surprize I was in, and endeavoured to ex|plain his Meaning. He told me, that I might have been divorced from this Wife in a legal Way, very common, e&s;pecially in <HI>France,</HI> and added &s;everal other Circum&s;tances, all tending to illu&s;trate what he had before &s;aid. I &s;hould be glad to know whe|ther
<PB N="59" REF="292">
he would have advi&s;ed me to hang my &s;elf, in hopes of &s;omebody's coming to cut me down?</P>
<P>After he had made &s;ome farther Enquiry into my Affairs, to which I replyed in few Words, I was or|dered to go out, and wait in the Anti-Chamber. As, in my Examination, I had mentioned the Son of Count <HI>de Munich,</HI> who I thought might know me, having &s;een me in foreign Countries, it was thought proper to &s;end for him, and, when he came, he was placed behind a Door, through which he took a View of me. A very nece&s;&s;ary Caution certainly! What Harm would it have been, if they had let him come nearer, that he might have &s;een and &s;po|ken to me? It would have been much more ea&s;y to him to have known me, in the Condition I was then in, by my Voice, than by my doleful A&s;pect. My Beard was, at that Time, of two Months Growth, I had a Peruke on, combed in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion, and a very ragged Cloak. Count <HI>de Munich</HI>'s Son had to be &s;ure never &s;een me in &s;uch an Equipage, and con|&s;equently could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to know me. After they had got what Information they thought nece&s;|&s;ary, the &s;ame Mini&s;ter, who had all along di&s;cour&s;ed with me, drew nearer, and asked the Name of the Per&s;on, who had been the Cau&s;e of all my Misfor|tunes. This Que&s;tion highly &s;urprized me, and I wonder I had not an&s;wered, <HI>Et o&s;i di vilt&agrave; tentare Argante?</HI> I was, however, contented with reply|ing, with a di&s;dainful Smile, that I could not believe he expected I &s;hould an&s;wer him. That he could not be ignorant of the Re&s;pect due to the Sex, though they often might not de&s;erve it. I thought proper, before I retired, to beg he would take Notice of my infirm State of Health, after &s;o tedious a Sickne&s;s, and of the &s;trange U&s;age I had met with from the fir&s;t Day of my Impri&s;onment. He gave me no other An&s;wer, than this: <HI>It is your own Fault, Sir, we &s;hall proceed as favourably as we can.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="293">
Reflect, I be&s;eech you, on this whole Procedure. But in order to inform you rightly of the State of Things, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint you with what I could learn of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Mini&s;try. It is certain, that all the grand Affairs tran&s;acted at pre&s;ent at the Court of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> are under the Directi|on of Mini&s;ters who are Foreigners, and though out of Decency, they are likewi&s;e communicated to two or three Natives of the Country, it is, neverthele&s;s, beyond all Doubt, that the Power is only in the Hands of the Former. And they are &s;o jealous of their Authority, and know &s;o well how to &s;upport one another, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are only looked on as Subalterns, who dare not undertake any Thing, without their previous Advice and Con&s;ent. In all Con&s;ultations that Mini&s;ter who examined me, pre|&s;ides: But tho he has a great Share in the Deci&s;ion of important Matters, yet, I believe it does not ap|pertain &s;olely to him. The others are Lords of the Court, who a&s;&s;i&s;t at Councils, Conferences, Audi|ences of foreign Mini&s;ters, and are con&s;ulted in all Concerns which are of any Moment. As the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI> are naturally &s;u&s;picious, diffident, and imagine, that there is not a Per&s;on in the World who&s;e Inte|grity can be relied on, there is always &s;ome Over|&s;eer every where, which is the Rea&s;on that even tho&s;e Things, which require the utmo&s;t Secrecy, are treated of in the Pre&s;ence of &s;everal Per&s;ons. How far this is advantageous or prejudicial to the State, is not my Province to determine. All I know is, that the wi&s;e&s;t Man in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> tho never &s;o well inclined to &s;erve his Country, would find it difficult to &s;ucceed in any Attempt, becau&s;e the continual Su&s;picions and Diffidence he would meet with, with Regard to him&s;elf, mu&s;t di&s;courage him, and make him lo&s;e that Freedom of Mind and Sentiments, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to terminate Affairs, that re|quire a ready Execution.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="294">
Let me now inform you of what I have learned of the &s;econd Cla&s;s of Mini&s;ters, who are the Sena|tors. The Senate con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Noblemen of the fir&s;t Rank, and &s;uch, as pa&s;s for Men of a great Genius, and thorough Knowledge of Bu&s;ine&s;s. Among the&s;e there are &s;ome, who have &s;erved the State, in the Quality of Amba&s;&s;adors to foreign Courts, others, who have been Generals in the Ar|my, and &s;ome, who have travelled through a great Part of <HI>Europe.</HI> I cannot inform you of the exact Number of the Senators, but am a&s;&s;ured from good Hands, it is but &s;mall. I know &s;ix or &s;even of them, with whom I have had &s;ome Concerns. They have a great Number of Secretaries, who are the mo&s;t ig|norant, the mo&s;t in&s;olent, and at the &s;ame Time, the mo&s;t pre&s;umptuous Animals, the Earth ever bore. The&s;e have under their Command a prodigious Troop of Clerks, who &s;eem to be always employed. Add to this the Multitude of petty Officers, who go, indeed, by the Name of Soldiers, but may be pla|ced among the lowe&s;t Dregs of the Vulgar, and are the very Scum of the People. Of all the&s;e con&s;i&s;ts that Augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly called the Senate. As for the re&s;pective Functions of each of the&s;e Officers, they them&s;elves are frequently &s;o ignorant of them, that it is no Wonder if a Stranger is &s;o. All I can &s;ay, on that Head, is, that they generally meet four or five Hours a Day, that they take a great deal of Pains them&s;elves, and give no le&s;s to others, with|out advancing the Intere&s;ts of the State. The Cu|&s;tom of this Nation, of deferring every Thing to the Morrow, is the Occa&s;ion that mo&s;t Affairs are not terminated, till after many Delays. This Re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;s is a natural Con&s;equence of the mutual Di|&s;tru&s;ts they entertain of each other; for as they can|not venture to deliver their Opinions with an entire Freedom, they are often nece&s;&s;itated to defer the mo&s;t urgent Affairs to another Time. The Door of
<PB N="62" REF="295">
this illu&s;trious <HI>Areopagus</HI> might be properly adorned with the following Device:
<Q><L>Hic opero&s;e nihil agitur.</L></Q></P>
<P>But this is not all. There is a third Order of Mi|ni&s;ters, if they may be allowed that Denomination, who compo&s;e what they call the Colleges; the&s;e Col|leges are divided into different Cla&s;&s;es. There is the College of War, that of Foreign Affairs, tho&s;e of Finances and Commerce, and &s;everal others. As I have had nothing to do with the&s;e Gentlemen, I can hardly give you any Account of their &s;eve|ral Functions. I am neverthele&s;s pretty confidently a&s;&s;ured, that all the Members of the&s;e Bodies, as well that of the Senate, as tho&s;e, who compo&s;e the Colleges, are only regarded as bare Commi&s;&s;ioners or Deputies under the Influence of the Mini&s;ters, who are Foreigners, and are e&s;teemed their Ora|cles. Nothing can be done without previou&s;ly con|&s;ulting, or receiving the Orders of the&s;e, and all the others live in the mo&s;t &s;ervile Fear and Sub|jection. The Governours of Provinces dare hardly ever undertake any Thing of their own Accord, and are even ignorant, how far their Authority and Juri&s;diction extends. Their natural Timidity, and the entire Dependance, they are always kept in, oc|ca&s;ion even Trifles to pa&s;s with them for Matters of the greate&s;t Importance.</P>
<P>This in a few Words, is what I have been able to learn of the Form of Government e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give you this Ab&s;tract,
<Q><L>Per quae po&s;&s;is, cogno&s;cere caetera tut&eacute;.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Fate of the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> would de&s;erve our Pity, had they any generous Pa&s;&s;ions, or any Ho|nour

at Heart. In proce&s;s of Time they may per|haps &s;hake off the Yoke, impo&s;ed on them by Fo|reigners, and then, perhaps, we may &s;ee <HI>Mu&s;co|vian</HI> Ve&s;pers, as we have formerly &s;een <HI>Sicilian</HI> Ve&s;pers. Their Hatred of Foreigners is &s;o great, that, in this Ca&s;e, hardly one would e&s;cape with Life. It would be the more ea&s;y to execute an Enterprize of this Kind, as the Authority Foreign|ers have a&s;&s;umed, is only founded on a &s;lavi&s;h Fear, into which the whole Nation is immerged.</P>
<P><HI>Peter</HI> I. who u&s;ed his utmo&s;t Endeavours to draw his Subjects out of Barbarity, having, in his Travels in <HI>France,</HI> at the Time of the Regency, made Enquiries into the then Form of Govern|ment, framed, and, in Part, executed the Project of regulating his own after that Model. He pro|po&s;ed, by e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;o many Councils, to em|ploy, in the Admini&s;tration, all tho&s;e of his Sub|jects, who &s;hould be mo&s;t capable of it, that in Time, they might render them&s;elves u&s;eful to their Prince and Country. I know not what Idea to frame of &s;uch a Form of Government, which &s;eems not the mo&s;t &s;uitable to &s;o de&s;potick a State, as that of <HI>Mu&s;covy:</HI> It will, I fear, in Time, produce many Di&s;orders, and in&s;en&s;ibly tinge the Com|monalty with <HI>Republican</HI> Principles.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een the Seeds of &s;uch Notions at the Death of <HI>Peter</HI> II; for a Motion was then made to form the Government into a Common|wealth. If this Project had taken Place, we &s;hould have &s;een a Plan of Government very diffe|rent from that of <HI>Plato,</HI> A <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Republick! It would, without doubt, have been a Ma&s;ter-Piece! But was <HI>Peter.</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> with all his fine Schemes and E&s;tabli&s;hments, &s;ufficiently acquainted with the Genius of his Subjects? I have great Room to doubt it, and this is my Rea&s;on There is not to this Day a &s;ingle <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> who is not
<PB N="64" REF="297">
betrer plea&s;ed with his Village, and his Oven, than with the mo&s;t eminent Po&s;t of Honour. They would have been better pleas'd, if <HI>Peter</HI> the Great, in&s;tead of attempting to change Bea&s;ts, as they were, into Men, had, on the contrary, labour'd, to reduce them from a State of Humanity to that of Brutes. All the Pains that Prince took have hardly had any Effect on his Subjects, farther than the curtailing their Beards, and a Change of their Habits. Their favourite Idols are Fire and Lazi|ne&s;s, to which they are ready to &s;acrifice their All. But I have &s;aid enough on this Article, and &s;hall now re&s;ume the Account of my own Adventures.</P>
<P>At my Return to my Pri&s;on, the Sergeant, who accompany'd me thither, offer'd me half a Ruble, to furni&s;h my &s;elf (as he &s;aid) with &s;ome Provi&s;ions. I told him, I had no Occa&s;ion for his Money, and begg'd he would rather &s;end me an Interpreter, and a Barber. He left me, but I could not obtain what I ask'd for. I wi&s;h'd for nothing &s;o much, in the Condition I was then in, as to con&s;ult &s;ome Phy&s;ician, and to be lodg'd in a more commodious Pri&s;on, where I might enjoy that Repo&s;e and Tran|quility, I &s;tood in &s;o great need of. As my Di&s;|temper continued, I begun to fear &s;ome fatal Event. Though I was ea&s;ed of the mo&s;t virulent Pains, and &s;trove to &s;upport Nature with the be&s;t Diet I could; yet I was &s;till very weak. I had entirely lo&s;t two of my Sen&s;es, Ta&s;te and Smell. A Thir&s;t, which nothing could allay, prey'd upon me ince&s;&s;ant|ly. All the&s;e Symptoms did not put me under any Apprehen&s;ions of my Life; but I was afflicted with others &s;till more grievous. A general Numb|ne&s;s &s;eized all my Limbs after Sleep, and when I awaked I found my &s;elf depriv'd of all Motion. My Head was then troubled with an uncommon Heavine&s;s. My Sight likewi&s;e underwent a great Change, for all Objects appeared to me double.
<PB N="65" REF="298">
The&s;e Symptoms di&s;appeared in&s;en&s;ibly after I had lain &s;ome Time in that deplorable Condition, but then a kind of Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s en&s;ued, for which I could not a&s;&s;ign any Cau&s;e. I applied, from Time to Time, my own Medicines, but tho I am well a&s;|&s;ured, that 'tis to them I owe my Life, yet could I not perceive, that they produced any vi&s;ible Effect.</P>
<P>As I con&s;tantly reiterated my Entreaties for an Interpreter, a young Man was at la&s;t brought to me, who &s;poke <HI>French,</HI> and was accompanied by the Sergeant, and an Over&s;eer, which they always think requi&s;ite in the like Ca&s;es. As it was my De&s;ign, that he &s;hould give a faithful Account of what I had to &s;ay to him, I de&s;ired him to take it down in Writing, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That no one might have Cau&s;e to cen&s;ure my Conduct, I declared, that, when Money was offer'd me, of which I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to &s;pecify the Value I did not think fit to accept of it, not knowing from who&s;e Hands it came, and being be&s;ides a&s;&s;ured, that Her Maje&s;ty would never offer me a Pre&s;ent, &s;o little agreable to Her great Genero&s;ity. I doubted not, but that, if Her Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue Her Orders, to procure me the Su&s;tenance I &s;tood in Need of, it would be in a Manner, &s;uitable to her Dignity, and my Birth; but &s;hould it be &s;ignified to me, that whatever was offered was by Her Order, I &s;hould always receive it with the greate&s;t Deference. All the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which Her Maje&s;ty might, in the mean Time, vouch&s;afe to lend me, would be of little Service to me, unle&s;s I was removed from the Pri&s;on, where I was, as I could not enjoy any Re&s;t there, either by Day, or by Night, and unle&s;s I was, in the mean while, &s;upplied with what was requi&s;ite for the Recove|ry of my Health, which at that time was in &s;o dangerous a Situation, that I run the Hazard of
<PB N="66" REF="299">
&s;inking very &s;oon under the Weight of my Mi|&s;eries. Should the&s;e Precautions on my Behalf be neglected, Her Maje&s;ty would lo&s;e an Op|portunity of puni&s;hing me, if I were a Crimi|nal; or, on the other Hand, if my Innocence were proved, &s;he would have the Regret of &s;eeing a Man peri&s;h mi&s;erably under her Eyes, who came into her Dominions with no other View, but of devoting the Re&s;t of his Days to her Service. To conclude, there was nothing I &s;aid, but what I had Room to hope from Her Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tice and Clemency."</Q></P>
<P>In this Memorandum I likewi&s;e particulari&s;ed all tho&s;e Things, which I &s;tood ab&s;olutely in Need of, <HI>viz.</HI> another Pri&s;on, a Phy&s;ician, my Trunk, and a Per&s;on, who might, on all Occa&s;ions, &s;erve me as an Interpreter. My Clerk promi&s;ed to give a faith|ful Account of all, I had dictated to him. I a&s;ked, why they would not &s;uffer me to be &s;haved, to which he replied, that they feared, I might make an Attempt upon my own Life.</P>
<P>My Memorandum had no farther Succe&s;s, but to procure the Change of my Pri&s;on three Days afterwards, when I was removed into the Secreta|ry's Apartment, who was obliged to &s;hift his Quar|ters, this new Lodging gave me a little more Ea&s;e, tho &s;ome Clerk or other was every Day running in and out for Papers, which had been left there. But, on the other Hand, I was tormented with a va&s;t Number of every Kind of In&s;ects that commonly frequent the mo&s;t odious and filthy Places. I had every Moment the Company of huge Rats, that con|&s;umed whatever I could procure for my&s;elf; and all the Furniture I had in this Secretary's Office, which I might ju&s;tly call a Ne&s;t of Rats, was two Chairs and a Table, without a Carpet.</P>
<P>This Change of Pri&s;on did not therefore, afford me the lea&s;t Relief. My Sickne&s;s encrea&s;ed daily, and I
<PB N="67" REF="300">
&s;aw no Hopes of any Succour. I remember, the 24th, which was <HI>Chri&s;tmas-Eve,</HI> being extreamly ill in my Bed, the Sergeant brought me a very large Goo&s;e and a Fowl, and gave me to under&s;tand, that this Pre&s;ent was &s;ent me by Her Imperial Ma|je&s;ty. I an&s;wered, that the Condition I was then in required other Succour, and de&s;ired him to &s;end me, with all Speed, a Phy&s;ician, and take his Pre|&s;ent back with him. But he left it, notwith&s;tand|ing all I could &s;ay, and retired. I gave them to my Guard, to di&s;po&s;e of as they thought fit, and make them&s;elves merry but I found they dur&s;t not touch them. The &s;ame Officer returned the next Morning, and made a great Bu&s;tle, becau&s;e they had let tho&s;e Provi&s;ions be &s;poiled, in&s;tead of carrying them away. I thought this a proper Time to make lively Expo&s;tulations with him a|bout my Trunk, where all my Linnen was, which I &s;tood the more in Need of, as I was eat up with Vermin. He took little Notice of what I &s;aid, but walk'd off with the Goo&s;e and Fowl.</P>
<P>The Refu&s;al of my Trunk, which I had &s;o long and &s;o pre&s;&s;ingly de&s;ired, was not without &s;ome Cau&s;e. Several Circum&s;tances made me &s;u&s;pect, that they had robbed me of Part of what it con|tained, and &s;trove now to conceal it. Theft is well known to be &s;o common in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> that no one is a&s;hamed of it. Great and Small, Men and Women, lay hold, without any Scruple, of the Property of another, wherever they meet with it. Hence it is, that People are always upon their Guard, and live in this Country in a continual Dif|fidence of each other. <HI>Peter</HI> I. was wont to &s;ay, that if he was to hang all the Thieves in his Do|minions, he &s;hould be de&s;titute of Subjects. My Su&s;picions were &s;till farther grounded, by the De|tention of the Key of my Trunk at <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> and by my &s;eeing the Sergeant, who had conducted me
<PB N="68" REF="301">
into the <HI>Czarina</HI>'s Palace, where he appear|ed like a Criminal, on whom Sentence was ju&s;t going to be pronounced. The&s;e &s;everal Con|&s;iderations induced me to believe, that I had been robbed, and that, to conceal the Fact, and avoid the Hands of Ju&s;tice, they had attempted to poi&s;on me. Their Proceedings, in Regard to me, in the Sequel, will give you very &s;trong Proofs of what I here advance.</P>
<P>You will, without doubt, be &s;hocked at the Peru&s;al of the&s;e Circum&s;tances of my Adventures. Had not my Courage &s;upported me in the dole|ful Condition I was in, I mu&s;t have inevitably pe|ri&s;hed. I &s;hould a thou&s;and Times have &s;unk un|der the Load of my Calamities, had I not pre|&s;erved a perfect Peace of Mind amid&s;t my great|e&s;t Di&s;tre&s;&s;es. I perceived my &s;elf often at the Point of Death, de&s;titute of all Relief, and of all Hopes of receiving any. Nothing afflicted me more than the Reflection of being &s;acrific'd, as I was, to the Fury and unju&s;t Re&s;entments of a Savage Nation, which, having not the lea&s;t Sen&s;e of Humanity, treated me as the mo&s;t abject of Slaves. Neverthele&s;s, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e Per|plexities, <HI>Neque ullam vocem protuli indignam viro, neque cedentem calamitati.</HI> I leave you to judge, after having weighed the&s;e Circum&s;tances, what Idea the World ought to form of this Nation, which at pre&s;ent makes &s;o much Noi&s;e in <HI>Europe,</HI> who&s;e Alliance is &s;o earne&s;tly &s;ought for, and which claims a Right to the Di&s;po&s;al of Kiugdoms. <HI>Spes improbi&s;&s;imas complectuntur in&s;perata a&s;&s;ecuti.</HI></P>

<P>_I mu&s;t not omit begging your Excu&s;e for the abrupt Manner, with which I conclu|ded my la&s;t. My Head was at that Time filled with &s;uch melancholy Ideas, and my Heart perplexed with Motions &s;o extraordinary, that I fancied my Hand was growing heavy, and my Ink appeared more black, than it really was. The&s;e Symptoms made me re&s;olve upon taking &s;ome Repo&s;e; for, whatever I write to you, &s;hall, as far as po&s;&s;ible, be the Product of a Mind at Ea&s;e, and by no Means of an impetuous Imagination. Not that I am fearful of being too &s;evere in my Cen&s;ures of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> who certainly de&s;erve no Mercy; But as I engaged in this Corre&s;pondence, with no o|ther View, than that of &s;atisfying your Curio&s;ity, I am not &s;o much intent on &s;eeking Revenge for the Injuries, done me by that Nation, as on informing you of what you de&s;ire to know of my Adventures. To continue my Narrative of them, I mu&s;t, therefore, tell you, that, after I had been left to &s;truggle with Death, for the Space of ten Days, a Phy&s;ician, was, at la&s;t, brought me by the Sergeant and an Over&s;eer. This Phy&s;ician happened unfortu|nately to &s;peak nothing but <HI>Latin;</HI> which gave me a great deal of Unea&s;ine&s;s; For, though I am pret|ty well ver&s;ed in that Language, yet I found it diffi|cult to expre&s;s my Thoughts, as I had never made made U&s;e of it in familiar Di&s;cour&s;e. I therefore immediately told my Phy&s;ician, that &s;ince I &s;hould hardly be able to give him the true Grounds of my
<PB N="70" REF="303">
Di&s;ea&s;e, I had Cau&s;e to fear he might not apply proper Medicines, nor give me that A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I &s;tood in Need of. He replyed by this Axiom, which he faid, was unque&s;tionable: <HI>Omnes Captivi infirmitatibus laborant;</HI> this unpromi&s;ing Beginning exa&s;perated me, &amp; <HI>indignatio dedit Linguam.</HI> I an|&s;wered him in as Philo&s;ophical Manner, <HI>Non doleo de captivitate, &s;ed de modo captivitatis.</HI> I continued my Harangue in the &s;ame Tone, but in a <HI>Latin</HI> Idi|om, as barbarous as the Country I was in. The Doctor, however, not thinking me perhaps &s;o tracta|ble, as blindly to &s;ubmit to his Pre&s;criptions, thought fit to retire: And this was all the Benefit I received from his Vi&s;it!</P>
<P>An Accident happened &s;ome Time after, which contributed not a little to confirm the Su&s;picions I had of my having been poi&s;oned. But give me leave to put you in mind of the following Circum&s;tances, before I inform you of what pa&s;&s;ed. Fir&s;t, the Key of my Trunk, which was demanded, and I was forced to &s;urrender at <HI>Mu&s;cow:</HI> In the &s;econd Place, my Sword, which was likewi&s;e taken from me at <HI>Mu&s;|cow,</HI> and locked up, in the Trunk; and la&s;tly, my Trunk it&s;elf, which had been detained from the 15th of <HI>December,</HI> the Day of my Arrival at <HI>Pe|ter&s;burg,</HI> 'till the 11th of <HI>January</HI> 1734. My Trunk was that Day brought into my Pri&s;on, guard|ed by &s;everal petty Officers, a Secretary, &s;ome Clerks and an Over&s;eer. The Secretary having fir&s;t &s;aluted me with a &s;miling Countenance, de|manded the Key of the Trunk. I an&s;wered, that I had the &s;ame Demand upon him. Seemingly &s;ur|prized at this An&s;wer, he &s;poke to tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent, as if he was enquiring what was become of the Key.</P>
<P>Several Que&s;tions and An&s;wers en&s;ued, which tended only to delude and blind me, till at la&s;t the Key appeared. They begun then, by unlocking
<PB N="71" REF="304">
the Padlock, but as it was &s;ealed, one of the Clerks addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Secretary, and, by his Looks, expre&s;&s;ing his Surprize, &s;aid: <HI>Sir, here are two Seals. Yes,</HI> replied the Secretary, the better to conceal his Villany, <HI>there are two, one of Ca&s;an, and the other of Mu&s;cow.</HI> The Trunk was at la&s;t opened, where I found every Thing in Di&s;or|der. I took out my Pi&s;tols and my Sword, which could not be there, but by a very great Miracle, as they mu&s;t have been put in, without taking off the Seal of <HI>Ca&s;an.</HI> I told the Secretary, that my Arms were u&s;ele&s;s to a Pri&s;oner, and would have put them into his Hands: But he an&s;wered, they mu&s;t be left in the Trunk, which he would &s;hut him&s;elf. It ap|peared to me &s;omewhat extraordinary, that I &s;hould be debarred the U&s;e of my Cloaths; for all I could obtain was three or four Shirts, which I &s;tood in great need of. They even refu&s;ed me, with the ut|mo&s;t Barbarity, &s;ome <HI>Eau des Carmes,</HI> and other Medicines. The Secretary having fir&s;t locked the Trunk, a&s;&s;ured me, that I &s;hould be &s;upplied with common Nece&s;&s;aries, by Orderm and at the Expence of her Maje&s;ty, and then retired.</P>
<P>The&s;e Circum&s;tances duly weighed, it will be ea|&s;y to determine, whether I was really poi&s;oned or not? I &s;hould even be glad, if, on this Subject, you would con&s;ult all the Phy&s;icians and natural Philo&s;ophers of your Acquaintance, who will not, in a ca&s;e &s;o &s;ingular, refu&s;e to give you their Opi|nion. For my Part, I &s;hould be glad to have my Su&s;picions removed, by a Demon&s;tration, that my Di&s;ea&s;e could be the Effect of any other Cau&s;e than Poi&s;on; but beg, you would fir&s;t maturely and lei&s;urely con&s;ider the following Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t, you may remember, I ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are very prone to Theft, and that it is a Vice common to the whole Nation. Hence I may infer the Probability of their embracing the fir&s;t
<PB N="72" REF="305">
Opportuni y that offered of robbing me. That this Conjecture comes nearly up to Truth, is but too e|vident, by the Key of my Trunk, being taken from me at <HI>Mu&s;cow.</HI> And I may rea&s;onably ask, what Occa&s;ion there was to &s;earch my Trunk at all? It had already been looked into at <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> and was, be&s;ides, clo&s;ely &s;ealed. Had Curio&s;ity been their &s;ole Inducemen &s;or viewing my Effects, they might have gratified it in my Pre&s;ence. But there are &s;till other Circum&s;tances. My Trunk was &s;eized, on my Arrival at <HI>Peer&s;burg,</HI> without any apparent Cau&s;e, and the Sergeant, who had brought me thither, ap|peared at the <HI>Czarina</HI>'s Palace, in the Po&s;ture of a Criminal. In Order to account for this Per&s;on's Fate, you mu&s;t know, that my Trunk was opened, as &s;oon as it was brought to <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> and that, after having compared the Contents with the Inven|tory &s;ent from <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> Part of the Things, &s;pecified in the la&s;t, was &s;ound to be wanting. The Serge|ant was immediately &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Thief, or at lea&s;t an Accomplice in the Robbery. The Trunk was, therefore, to be detained, till the Deficiency could be repaired, and &s;ome one be in&s;tantly di&s;patched to Mu&s;cow to recover what was &s;tolen. It is certain, the Sergeant him&s;elf was directly &s;ent back thither: For when, &s;ome Days after my Arrival at <HI>Peter&s;|burg,</HI> I asked, what was become of my Sled, they an&s;wered, the Sergeant had taken it to return to <HI>Mu&s;cow.</HI> In &s;hort, my Trunk was not returned to me, till the 11th of <HI>January,</HI> twenty-&s;even Days after my Arrival at <HI>Peter&s;burg;</HI> a Time, &s;ufficient to go to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> to di&s;charge the Commi&s;&s;ion, which the Sergeant was entru&s;ted with, and to return to <HI>Peter&s;burg.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are, beyond all Contradiction, Probabi|lities, which, on many Occa&s;ions, might pa&s;s for evi|dent Proofs; but let us examine the Affair yet far|ther, The Secretary demanded the Key of my
<PB N="73" REF="306">
Trunk, when it was brought to me, and endeavou|red to per&s;uade me, that it had been likewi&s;e &s;ealed at <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> in order to in&s;inuate, that it had not been opened &s;ince. Could any Thing be more ridicu|lous, than to imagine, I had &s;uch a Stock of Cre|dulity, as to be per&s;uaded, that they had neglected a thorough View of all my Effects? They were too de&s;irous of knowing, who I was, and of finding &s;ome Pretence, whereby to ju&s;tify their Proceedings with Regard to me, to omit &s;uch a Search. I &s;hould likewi&s;e be glad to know, what they can al|ledge in Re&s;pect to my Sword, which the Officer of the Guards at <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> &s;eemed &s;o much plea&s;ed with, which I wore till I reached <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> and which at length I found in my Trunk, though they pretend|ed it had not been opened either at <HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> or at <HI>Pe|ter&s;burg.</HI> I am certainly highly obliged to the <HI>Mu&s;|covites,</HI> if they have found out the Secret of imparting to my Sword &s;ome of tho&s;e Qualities, attributed to the Thunder-Bolt, e&s;pecially that of penetrating the mo&s;t &s;olid Bodies, without leaving the lea&s;t Mark; for then I &s;hall hereafter be armed as powerfully as <HI>Jove</HI> him&s;elf. What could, in fine, induce them to re|fu&s;e me my Cloaths, and to &s;hut the Trunk &s;o ab|ruptly, without giving me Time to examine what was in it? I &s;hould not, I believe, deviate very far from the Truth, were I to &s;ay that they proceeded in this unaccountable Manner, the better to conceal the Robbery, they had committed on the greate&s;t Part of my Equipage, the Want of which I was for|ced to bear with during the whole Time of my Cap|tivity. As I have now averred the Theft, I &s;hall find it more ea&s;y to prove, that I was poi&s;oned. You may perhaps ask, who were the Authors of the for|mer Villany? For your Satisfaction, let it &s;uffice, that I put you in Mind of my having ca&s;t the Nativity of the Secretary of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> when the Humour took me to tell him, that the Gallows would &s;oon be his Fate.
<PB N="74" REF="307">
And in Reality the whole Matter mu&s;t fall upon that Secretary, and his Accomplices.</P>
<P>My Sickne&s;s became in the mean while &s;o ex|tream, and I was reduced to &s;o feeble a State, that my Guard were obliged to carry me, whenever I had occa&s;ion to ea&s;e Nature. I was again afflicted with a Cholick, accompanied with Pains, &s;o vio|lent, that I almo&s;t begun to fear I had been poi&s;oned a &s;econd Time. This new Paroxi&s;m was however, of a &s;hort Duration, it left me in&s;en&s;ibly, and I found my &s;elf in better Health, than I had been before. The ince&s;&s;ant Reque&s;ts, I had long made, for a Phy&s;ici|an, were at la&s;t complied with. He was accom|panied by the &s;ame Clerk, who had played his Le|ger-de-main Tricks with the two Seals, at the opening of my Trunk. The Doctor, who &s;poke good <HI>Ita|lian,</HI> immediately enquired into the Nature of my Di&s;temper. I told him, that to give him a true Idea of it, I could not avoid entring into &s;everal Particu|lars, which would nece&s;&s;arily require his Attention. After having given him an Account of my Con&s;ti|tution, I acquainted him what befel me at my De|parture from <HI>Mu&s;cow.</HI> My Phy&s;ician was every Moment interrupted by the Clerk who was pre&s;ent, and, as he had Orders to write down this whole Con&s;ultation, was teazing him to know what I &s;aid; he even de&s;ired us, in pre&s;&s;ing Terms, to ha&s;ten to a Conclu&s;ion. The Phy&s;ician, who had his In&s;truc|tions, &s;eemed to give Way to the Secretary's In&s;tan|ces, and before he had Time to inform him&s;elf of my Di&s;ea&s;e, advi&s;ed me to take a Vomit, and to be blooded. To this I an&s;wered, that I could not pre|vail upon my &s;elf to follow the Advice which he gave me, without informing him&s;elf of my Di&s;ea&s;e: That as for the Emetick, I was re&s;olved not to take it; and, though I might hope for &s;ome Relief from Bleeding, yet I could not with any Probability ex|pect a Surgeon, &s;ince they had refu&s;ed to &s;end me a

Barber, le&s;t I &s;hould make away with my &s;elf. I then informed him of the Treatment I had met with, but all the An&s;wer, he made me was, that I mu&s;t con|form to the Cu&s;toms of the Country. The Clerk, likewi&s;e, thought fit to give me his Advice, and &s;aid, that Grief being my Di&s;ea&s;e, I mu&s;t wait my Remedy from Time and Circum&s;tances. This &s;tung me to the quick, and put me in Mind of my for|mer Phy&s;ician's Axiom. To convince him of this Mi&s;take, I told him, in the&s;e very Terms: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, my Mind has no Share in the doleful Condition I am reduced to, and give me leave to tell you, that a Man, tho a Pri&s;oner, may enjoy a perfect Free|dom of Mind. But the Ca&s;e is this, you have neither Orders nor Lei&s;ure to hear me &s;peak, and &s;eem but little inclined to give me that A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I &s;tand &s;o much in Need of; therefore, not to de|tain you any longer, you are at Liberty to be gone. All the Favour I ask of you is, to tell tho&s;e Gentlemen, who &s;ent you, that a Patient is not relieved by the bare Sight of a Phy&s;ician, and that no Remedy ought to be pre&s;cribed to me, till I am allowed to tell my Ca&s;e. Your Vi&s;its will be always agreeable, and may prove highly beneficial to me, if you have &s;o much Influence as to procure me that Permi&s;&s;ion; but if it be thought improper to grant me that Favour, to give your &s;elf any farther Trouble, &s;eems to me entirely needle&s;s."</Q> Whether my Phy&s;ician was plea&s;ed with this Compliment I know not; but the contrary &s;eems mo&s;t probable, for he in&s;tantly re|tired, and gave him&s;elf no farther Trouble about me.</P>
<P>I continued to fare very hard, notwith&s;tanding the repeated Promi&s;es made me, &s;everal Days together, that I &s;hould be maintained by the Order, and at the Expence, of Her Imperial Maje&s;ty, and I &s;aw no &s;igns of any thing being &s;ent me by that Prince&s;s.
<PB N="76" REF="309">
The Matter was, I &s;uppo&s;e, deemed &s;o very im|portant, that it required a Re&s;pite, till the Morrow. This Rule is generally ob&s;erved by the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> when the Point in Debate relates to Disbur&s;ements: And they are certainly right; for Money is not &s;o &s;carce, in any other Country in the World. An Interpreter, at la&s;t appeared, after I had long wait|ed for him, accompanied by two or three Per&s;ons, who came to tell me, he had Orders to provide for my Su&s;tenance. I expre&s;&s;ed my Satisfaction at this News, and told him, the &s;ooner the better. But how replied he, do you expect to be &s;erved? How &s;aid I? Ju&s;t as you think fit, provided it be not after the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Manner, for their Ragoos I am not accu|&s;tomed to. He then con&s;ulted with tho&s;e, who were pre&s;ent, and &s;aid, that I might have Money allow|ed me, and asked how much would do? This Que|&s;tion made me laugh, and I de&s;ired to know, in my turn, if he took me for a Per&s;on that would accept of Money. I ordered him to tell his Ma&s;ters, that I &s;hould always, with the utmo&s;t Deference and Gra|titude, accept of whatever &s;hould be offered me by Her Maje&s;ty's Order. This Reply gave Occa&s;ion to a fre&s;h Con&s;ultation, which being ended, this weighty Affair was put off to the Morrow.</P>
<P>The Nece&s;&s;ity I lay under of making my Ca&s;e known to &s;ome able Phy&s;ician, put me upon writing an exact Relation of all that had happened to me, to &s;end it to Mon&s;. <HI>du Vernoi,</HI> Anatomy-Profe&s;&s;or. You may remember the Character I have already given you of him. He is a Man of Merit, and one to whom I am greatly obliged. At the &s;ame Time, I wrote a &s;hort Memorial to the Empre&s;s, wherein I com|plained of the Manner in which I was treated. I was told, they &s;hould both be &s;afely delivered; but as neither of them produced the Effect I hoped, they probably were both &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. I was even treated with more Severity than before; for after this, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="77" REF="310">
all my Remon&s;trances, I never could obtain either Phy&s;ician or Interpreter, either Pen and Ink, or my Cloaths.</P>
<P>That the&s;e Gentlemen acted, with the utmo&s;t Inju|&s;tice, with Regard to me, is mo&s;t certain; and yet they may have had their Motives to palliate tho&s;e Pro|ceedings. In order to unfold this My&s;tery, I mu&s;t put you in Mind of the Hatred, which the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI> bear to all Strangers who are any Expence to them. This undoubted Truth is one of the Motives, which induce me to believe, that the Gentlemen in the Admini&s;tration at <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> were re&s;olved upon my Perdition at any Rate. And indeed, what Ne|ce&s;&s;ity could there be to detain me in that City eight or ten Days? Why was I, at my Arrival at <HI>Peter&s;|berg,</HI> refu&s;ed the immediate Benefit of a Phy&s;ician, &s;ince there are &s;o many of the Profe&s;&s;ion in that Place? At la&s;t indeed they &s;ent me one, but he &s;poke <HI>Latin</HI> only, and the Conver&s;ation I had with him, was, be&s;ides, &s;o very &s;hort, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly be informed of my Ca&s;e, nor apply proper Remedies. As they knew I was an <HI>Italian,</HI> and there are three or four Phy&s;icians of that Nation in the Town, why was I not permitted to &s;peak to one of them? They very well knew, I was conver&s;ant in the <HI>French</HI> Tongue, why was not &s;ome one of that Nation &s;uffered to come to me? The &s;econd Phy&s;ician &s;poke, I confe&s;s, the <HI>Italian</HI> Tongue ve|ry well; but the Orders, which were given to in|terrupt our Conver&s;ation every Moment, hindered me from making my Ca&s;e known. They feared, and very ju&s;tly too, that, had I given an exact Ac|count of it, the Phy&s;ician would have di&s;covered the real Cau&s;e of my Di&s;temper. What can be in-ferred from their Refu&s;al of letting me make U&s;e of the Medicines, I had in my Trunk? They were probably afraid, that tho&s;e Remedies might re&s;tore my Health, which they did their utmo&s;t Endea|vours
<PB N="78" REF="311">
to prevent. The Attempt, they had made on my Life, would, they hoped, be concealed from the World by my Death. The Expedient they made U&s;e of to &s;ilence my Complaints, was very odd. They allowed me to write to a Phy&s;ician, but, at the &s;ame Time, intercepted my Letter, be|cau&s;e the Peru&s;al of it might di&s;clo&s;e a Secret, which it was too much their Intere&s;t to conceal. Therefore, to compa&s;s their iniquitous Scheme, they could u&s;e no better Means, than that of leaving me alone. It would perhaps be difficult, to di&s;cover, how the Poi&s;on was conveyed to me, and to name the prin|cipal Authors of &s;o execrable an Attempt, but that they did find Means to give it me, and that every <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> is ju&s;tly liable to be &s;u&s;pected thereof, are mo&s;t indi&s;putable Truths.
<Q><L>Ad te, qui&s;quis is es, no&s;tra querela redit.</L></Q></P>
<P>I now leave you to judge, whether the Report, &s;pread throughout all <HI>Europe,</HI> of the Death of the three la&s;t Sovereigns of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> being owing to Poi&s;on, was &s;o very groundle&s;s. They will certainly find it very difficult, to clear them&s;elves from an Imputa|tion, which is but too well founded. They are al|ready known by too many iniquitous Pa&s;&s;ages, not to be thought capable of any Thing. In all their Proceedings, they are known to con&s;ult their private Intere&s;t only, and the Project they have formed of extending their Dominions, has induced them to commit all kinds of Inju&s;tice, in Regard to their Neighbours. They have invaded the fine&s;t Coun|tries, to open their Way into <HI>Germany.</HI> They have long &s;ince aimed at the &s;ole Dominion of the <HI>Baltick.</HI> The whole World is &s;en&s;ible of the Tyranny they ex|erci&s;e in <HI>Poland,</HI> after having &s;owed Di&s;cord in that Kingdom. And <HI>Europe</HI> has Rea&s;on to fear their penetrating yet farther, and kindling a Flame in
<PB N="79" REF="312">
other Countries, as they have done in <HI>Poland.</HI> It is the Intere&s;t of more Potentates, than one, to &s;et Bounds to their Ambition, and to break their Mea|&s;ures; and it were to be wi&s;hed, that a Method might be &s;peedily found of driving them back into their Fore&s;ts, and lurking Holes, where they lived whole Ages in Ob&s;curity. As they de&s;ire nothing more earne&s;tly, than to revive their antient Cu|&s;toms, and to live unknown to the re&s;t of Man|kind, nothing could be of greater Service to them. They bear &s;o great an Aver&s;ion to the Innovations, which have been attempted to be introduced among them, in the la&s;t forty Years, that, if they were left to them&s;elves, they would &s;oon &s;hake off the Yoke, which they think is impo&s;ed on them. This Nation is fit for nothing but to be kept in Bondage and Ob|&s;curity. Is it not &s;urprizing, that notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;olute Power of their Monarchs, they have hi|therto been &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful in their Endeavours, to render this Country flouri&s;hing in Commerce, and to e&s;tabli&s;h Religion and Sciences among them.</P>
<P>Whoever &s;hould undertake to enquire into the O|rigin of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> mu&s;t be greatly perplexed by this their &s;ingular Character. If I could prevail up|on my &s;elf to believe, that there were <HI>Pre-adamites,</HI> I &s;hould almo&s;t have &s;worn, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are their De&s;cendants. And they mu&s;t certainly be al|lowed to owe their Extraction to a Set of Men, very different, from any we now meet with. I have, after many Reflections, formed a Conjecture, which appears to me entirely well grounded, and will, I am a&s;&s;ured, notwith&s;tanding its Novelty, meet with your Approbation. You cannot be ignorant of the unanimous Con&s;ent of Hi&s;torians, in the mention they make of this Nation, that no Traces can be found of its antient State, and that the profound Ignorance, in which it has been always involved, has rendered all Enquiries, into its Original, entirely
<PB N="80" REF="313">
fruitle&s;s. This great Difficulty has kept all Hi&s;to|rians in Su&s;pence, and deterred them from attempt|ing any Deci&s;ion on this Article. But I will lead you into the Path they &s;hould have followed, and which I my &s;elf have taken, in making this &s;ignal Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Whenever the Origin of a People is not di&s;co|verable by any Monuments of Antiquity, we mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity examine their Manners and Cu&s;toms, and compare them with tho&s;e of other Nations, and e&s;pecially of their Neighbours. This being premi&s;ed, I need only put you in Mind of a Piece of Hi&s;tory, which you are not ignorant of, tho you may not know how &s;o ea&s;ily to fix it to any certain Period. You may remember to have read, that the <HI>Scythians,</HI> at their Return from their third Expedition in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> met, on the Frontiers of their Country, a numerous Army, ready to oppo&s;e their Entrance. Their own Wives, being tired of &s;o long a State of Viduity, had all agreed to throw them|&s;elves into the Arms of their Slaves, and had in|&s;pired tho&s;e ba&s;e Lover; with &s;ufficient Courage and Strength to take up Arms. The <HI>Scythians,</HI> informed of this Procedure, con&s;ulted among them|&s;elves, what Cour&s;e to take. They imagined, that to employ their Arms again&s;t their Slaves, would be to deba&s;e them&s;elves: They therefore, armed them&s;elves with Scourges only, and in that Manner marched again&s;t the Rebels, who, awed by the Pre|&s;ence of their Ma&s;ters, were immediately &s;eized with a Panick, and endeavoured to &s;ave them|&s;elves by Flight. The&s;e Wretches, fearful of a Pur&s;uit, penetrated very far towards the <HI>North,</HI> in|to a Country, then un inhabited, which their De&s;cendants &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>If you ca&s;t your Eyes upon a Map, it will in|&s;tantly appear to you, that the Country, into which the&s;e Slaves made their Retreat, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be
<PB N="81" REF="314">
the &s;ame, which is now known by the Name of <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> It would be derogatory from the exten|&s;ive Knowledge you have in Hi&s;tory, &s;hould I here attempt to prove this Fact, which is atte&s;ted by all Authors, who have written of the <HI>Scythians</HI> and their Country. This great Event is likewi&s;e con|firmed by an authentick Monument, which we to this Day meet with in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> for the Place, to which they at fir&s;t retired, is &s;till known by the Name of <HI>the City of Slaves.</HI></P>
<P>Such is the Original of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> which none, but them&s;elves, ought to regard as a My&s;te|ry. You need therefore no longer think it &s;trange, that a People, de&s;cended from &s;uch Ance&s;tors, has &s;trove, to remain in Ob&s;curity, by neglecting to tran&s;mit to Po&s;terity the&s;e Titles, and all other Monuments, which could lead us to the Know|ledge of them. The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> would thereby have di&s;covered them&s;elves to be not only Slaves by Birth, but likewi&s;e Traitors, Cowards and Re|bels. All the&s;e fine Qualities are &s;till di&s;cernable in that Nation, and it is well known, that Slave|ry has been handed down among them from Fa|ther to Son, without any Interruption, till the pre|&s;ent Age. The A&s;&s;urance, wherewith they boa&s;t them&s;elves to be De&s;cendants of the <HI>Scythians,</HI> may therefore be pardoned, provided they mean in the Manner I have here explained.</P>
<P>To remove all Doubts, that may be rai&s;ed on this Head, I beg leave to add a Word or two about tho&s;e <HI>Tartars,</HI> who are Neighbours of the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> You know, without Doubt, that the&s;e People are the &s;ame <HI>Scythians,</HI> of whom &s;everal Authors make Mention, and who&s;e Exploits were formerly famous throughout the whole World. The&s;e are the People, who po&s;&s;e&s;s, to this Day, be&s;ides great <HI>Tartary,</HI> the two fine&s;t Empires in the World, which are <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Mogul.</HI> Not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="82" REF="315">
the va&s;t Extent of the Countries this Nation is Ma&s;ter of, there is not a &s;ingle Tribe among them, but is thoroughly acquainted not on|ly with their common Origin, but likewi&s;e in par|ticular with their own De&s;cent. They can inform you, with the utmo&s;t Accuracy, what Branch they are de&s;cended from. Whence proceeds then &s;o great a Difference, as we here ob&s;erve, between two Nations bordering on each other? It may be very ea&s;ily explained. The <HI>Tartars</HI> are tho&s;e famous <HI>Scythians,</HI> who glory in their Origin; and the <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI> are tho&s;e cowardly Slaves, who&s;e De&s;cent and Extraction have rendered them infamous.</P>
<P>Whatever Arguments the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> advance, with a View of per&s;uading us, that they are De&s;|cendants of the <HI>Scythians,</HI> this &s;ingle Ob&s;ervation may almo&s;t &s;uffice to &s;ubvert. But I cannot really perceive, that they have any Thing in common with that Nation. The greate&s;t Part of the mo|dern <HI>Tartars,</HI> on the contrary, &s;eem to have an en|tire Re&s;emblance with tho&s;e ancient <HI>Scythians. Ju&s;tin, Herodotus,</HI> and &s;ome other Authors, de&s;cribe the Manners, and relate the brave Exploits of tho&s;e Conquerors, and, if you compare them with what we read of the <HI>Mungals</HI> and <HI>Kalmucs,</HI> you will find a very great Re&s;emblance between tho&s;e People. An intrepid Courage, and a &s;urprizing Magnanimity, are Qualities, which we ob&s;erve in the <HI>Tartars</HI> here mentioned; but the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves only by their Cowardice and Ba&s;ene&s;s. You will not find it an ea&s;y Matter, Sir, to meet, in Hi&s;tory, with Conjectures better founded, than the&s;e, about the Original of the <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI> therefore, <HI>&s;i tibi vera videntur dede manus.</HI> And with this I &s;hall conclude my Let|ter, re&s;erving for the next a Subject more joco&s;e and diverting. You judge very rightly, that, to entertain you with Matters of this Kind, which

ought always to be treated not only, <HI>corpore valido,</HI> but likewi&s;e, <HI>animo &s;ereno,</HI> I mu&s;t needs put a great Con&s;traint on my &s;elf. In the mean Time,

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE Treatment I here meet with is cer|tainly mo&s;t extraordinary. The <HI>Mu&s;co|vites,</HI> perceiving that my Sickne&s;s did not put an End to my Life, endea|voured by all po&s;&s;ible Means to effect it by Hunger. This would certainly have been the Event of their Barbarity, had I not received timely A&s;|&s;i&s;tance from Mr <HI>de L'I&s;le</HI> and his Wife. I &s;hall, in the Sequel, have frequent Occa&s;ion to mention them both, and, by what I &s;hall &s;ay of them, you'll find, that Mini&s;ters, Generals of Armies and War|riours are not the only Per&s;ons, who promote the Honour of the <HI>French</HI> Nation. In order to ap|prize you fully of what I have to &s;ay, it will be proper to re&s;ume the Thread of my Relation.</P>
<P>Though my Di&s;ea&s;e was become Chronical, and in a Manner incurable, it was neverthele&s;s not &s;o violent as before, and I begun to be &s;en&s;ible of the Nece&s;&s;ity I lay under of taking &s;ome &s;olid, nou|ri&s;hing Food, which might &s;upport Nature, and in&s;en&s;ibly increa&s;e my Strength. All the Provi&s;i|ons, which my Guard brought me, at my own Expence, were &s;o dear, and, at the &s;ame Time, &s;o very bad, that I re&s;olved at la&s;t, to &s;eek for other Diet. The Gentleman and Lady before
<PB N="84" REF="317">
mentioned were therefore to be applied to, and I found it nece&s;&s;ary to beg of them, to &s;end me &s;ome Wine, and other Provi&s;ions, which I &s;tood mo&s;t in Need of. As I was neither permitted to &s;peak, nor to write to any one, my greate&s;t Difficulty was, how to acquaint them with my De&s;ires. I found Means at la&s;t, after having given my &s;elf a great deal of Trouble, to put my Project in Execution, by prevailing upon a Clerk to write down whatever I &s;hould dictate to him in the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Tongue. You mu&s;t not wonder to find me dictating a Let|ter in this Tongue, for Nece&s;&s;ity is the be&s;t Ma&s;ter of Languages, <HI>Ingen&icirc;que largitor venter.</HI> I had begun &s;ome Time before to under&s;tand the Lan|guage of the Country pretty well, and knew enough to ask for what I &s;tood in Need of.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>de L'I&s;le</HI> no &s;ooner received my Letter, than he &s;ent me much more than I de&s;ired. I had no Room to doubt of his being apprized of my Adventures, and of my Arrival at <HI>Peter&s;burg;</HI> be|cau&s;e his Brother, without Doubt, had advi&s;ed him of my Fate: And be&s;ides, as I named him, in my Examination, it is highly probable, he was likewi&s;e interrogated. I have even been &s;ince in|formed, that he was placed behind a Door, to &s;ee whether he knew me. Having &s;oon con&s;umed the Provi&s;ions, &s;ent me by Mr. <HI>De L'I&s;le,</HI> and what I had provided at my own Expence, as they had &s;everal Times promi&s;ed, I &s;hould be furni&s;hed with Nece&s;&s;aries by Order of the Court, and I &s;aw no Effect of this Promi&s;e, I thought it my Duty to expo&s;tulate pretty warmly with the Officer on that Head. He an&s;wered, that, &s;ince I had de|clared my Aver&s;ion to <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Ragoos, they were extreamly at a Lo&s;s, what to provide for me. Lit|tle &s;atisfied with &s;o poor a Pretence, I &s;poke to him in &s;uch haughty Terms, as terrified him from coming near me again in ha&s;te. And &s;o it is with
<PB N="85" REF="318">
the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> in general, not excepting their Sol|diers, when they meet with any Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>It is pretty extraordinary, that I could never learn what they call a Man of Courage in the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Tongue. I am almo&s;t inclined to think, that, as there is not a Man among them, who has the lea&s;t Valour to boa&s;t of, &s;uch a Term would be entirely u&s;ele&s;s to them. This Cowardice, and a certain bruti&s;h Di&s;po&s;ition, equally natural to them, are Qualities, which I cannot well reconcile.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There does not &s;eem to be much Difficulty in reconcil|ing them; for Bullies are always Cowards.</NOTE> They have a Law, whereby all Subjects are for|bid to draw their Swords, and it has been &s;o reli|giou&s;ly ob&s;erved throughout the whole Empire, that there has not been one In&s;tance of its being violated. I know not whether they have any Laws to prevent Theft, but, if they have, they are not much enforced. What Inference may we draw from this Ob&s;ervation? May we not ju&s;tly &s;ay, that they are naturally inclined to Pilfering, and that their Pu&s;illanimity is the Occa&s;ion that they ne|ver draw their Swords? I leave you to decide this Que&s;tion, and doubt not, but you will be of my Opinion.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, I gave my Guard to under|&s;tand, that, as they continued to neglect bringing me any Provi&s;ions, I &s;hould find Means of being admitted to the <HI>Czarina's</HI> Pre&s;ence, and that I &s;hould make my Complaints to Her Maje&s;ty of tho&s;e, who refu&s;ed to execute her Orders. I re|peated the&s;e Menaces to the whole Body of Clerks, who were in my Anti-Chamber, and my Officer venturing at la&s;t to appear again, I a&s;&s;ured him, I would break the Windows, and entreat Relief, of tho&s;e who pa&s;&s;ed by in the Street. The&s;e Threats produced their Effect; for, the next Morning, the Corporal came with a Pur&s;e in his Hand, and &s;aid,
<PB N="86" REF="319">
that I might order what I plea&s;ed. I told him I wanted Bread, Wine, Sugar and Meat, all which he &s;oon after brought me. I gave the &s;ame Or|ders the next Day, but found it no longer com|plied with. One of my Guard refu&s;ed to take the Money I offered him, to buy what I &s;tood in Need of, pretending he had received Orders not to concern him&s;elf with any of my Commi&s;&s;ions. I was not a little &s;urprized to hear of &s;uch an Or|der, but was obliged to put up with it, and to make &s;hift with the Remnants of the preceding Day. After this, I had but very little, and &s;ome|times nothing at all to eat for &s;ome Days. When it was my Fate to fa&s;t, one of the Soldiers took up a <HI>Violin,</HI> and invited me to dance, &s;aying, <HI>French</HI>-Men could forget Hunger for a Jigg. This Farce diverted me for a Time, but my Patience being, at length, tired, I was again &s;o bu&s;y with my Threats, that my Soldiers, brought me the &s;ame Evening a fine Piece of roa&s;ted Meat, &s;ome Bread and Wine: And no le&s;s a Fea&s;t than this would have &s;ufficed to allay my voracious Appe|tite. When my Repa&s;t was ended, folding up a Piece of Paper, in which &s;ome Salt had been wrap|ped, I accidentally &s;aw &s;ome Writing upon it. Curio&s;ity inducing me to read it, I perceived, it contained only &s;ome A&s;tronomical Calculations. I immediately conceived, that I was obliged to Mr. <HI>De L'I&s;le</HI> and his Wife for my Supper; and was &s;o enraged at this Proceeding, that I made u&s;e of the mo&s;t bitter Invectives to reproach the Corpo|ral. I even threatened him, Her Imperial Maje|&s;ty &s;hould know how her Orders were executed, being a&s;&s;ured, &s;he would reward them all with a Halter. He begun to excu&s;e him&s;elf by the Diffi|culty, he pretended, there was in plea&s;ing me, but I was &s;o loud with my Complaints, that he re|tired in a Pannick.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="320">
Were I to relate the many Scenes I pa&s;&s;ed thro on this Account, I &s;hould never have done. It may &s;uffice, to tell you, that all the Food I had, from the 11th of <HI>January</HI> to the 15th of <HI>February,</HI> were &s;ent me by Mr. <HI>De L'I&s;le.</HI> This Gentleman even gave my Guard &s;ome other Nece&s;&s;aries, but tho&s;e Villains thought fit, as I afterwards found, to keep them for their own U&s;e. I had been in great Danger of being &s;tarved in my Pri&s;on, had I not been &s;o kindly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr. <HI>De L'I&s;le.</HI> The Impo&s;&s;ibility the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> lie under of main|taining their Pri&s;oners, whil&s;t they have &s;o large a Number of Foreigners on their Hands, is the on|ly Pretence that can ju&s;tify their Conduct with Re|gard to me. Could you ever have thought, that the whole Revenue of this va&s;t Empire does not amount to above ten or twelve Millions of Crowns? Their Genero&s;ity cannot be very exten&s;ive out of &s;o incon&s;iderable an Income. But after all, you may object, Why was I not &s;atisfied with what they gave me? Was it not &s;ufficient, to be fed in the Manner they live them&s;elves? Black Bread, Salt, and often putrid Fi&s;h, are the Victuals, and Water the Drink, they generally put up with in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> Could a Pri&s;oner as I was, a Per&s;on unknown, expect to meet with a better Treatment? Had they vouch&s;afed me the Allowance, given in other Countries to Pri&s;oners of State, I &s;hould a|lone have con&s;umed as much, as would have &s;erved half a Dozen of <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Families. The Scarce|ne&s;s of Money in this Country, and the Mi&s;ery, the People are reduced to, can hardly be imagin|ed. In the whole Extent of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> there does not &s;o much Money circulate, during the Cour&s;e of a Year, as at <HI>Paris, London,</HI> and <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in a &s;ingle Day. I believe I &s;hould &s;peak within Compa&s;s, if I tell you, that the daily Expence of a &s;ingle Merchant at <HI>London</HI> far exceeds that of a
<PB N="88" REF="321">
whole City in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> This impo&s;&s;ibility which they laboured under of maintaining me, in the Man|ner I ought to have been treated, was the Rea&s;on that they gladly left that Care to Mr. <HI>de L'I&s;le</HI> and his Wife, who were both as kind and gene|rous to me, as the People in <HI>France</HI> generally are to Strangers. Tho I forbid my Guard going to a&s;k for any Thing at Mr. <HI>de L'I&s;le</HI>'s, yet they con&s;tantly went thither, and not a Day pa&s;&s;ed that I did not receive &s;ome Tokens of their Benevolence. I a&s;|&s;ure you, his Genero&s;ity to me, exceeded whatever I could expect from the be&s;t of my Friends. I in|tend to let you know more on this Article on an other Occa&s;ion. Permit me now to entertain you with an Account how I employed my Time in my Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>I found Means to make a &s;hift without Pen, Pa|per or Ink, as I was de&s;titute of tho&s;e Helps. A Nail, which by Chance I found in my Pri&s;on, &s;up|plied the Place of a Pen, and, in&s;tead of Paper, I made u&s;e of the Table, from whence they had taken away the Carpet. I had therefore no Occa&s;i|on for Ink, to write with. I begun by engraving on the Edge of the Drawer the&s;e Words:
<Q><L>Inter &s;cribas et Phari&s;aeos innocens erat.</L></Q></P>
<P>After this I undertook to embroider all my Table, and my fir&s;t Attempt was an Encomium on the <HI>Czarina,</HI> in the following Words:<Q><L>Anna della tue glorie al &s;criver pronto</L>
<L>Dell' ala della fama</L>
<L>Piuma &s;tringer vorrei;</L>
<L>Ma mi&s;ero &s;ol &s;ervo</L>
<L>Suelta dal Carcer mio penna di ferro.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="322">
Having thus begun to take delight in Poetry, I made the&s;e following Lines.<Q><L>Anna delle tue Lodi</L>
<L>Pur dir vorrei, Ma alla materia va&s;ta</L>
<L>Un &s;ol foglio po&s;eggo ed ei non ba&s;ta.</L></Q></P>
<P>It would be difficult to account, <HI>ut &s;ic repente Po|eta prodirem.</HI> But however it happened my Table, was, in a few Days, covered with wretched Ver&s;es. The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> under&s;tood nothing of the Matter; nor, indeed, did I make them for their U&s;e. I re|&s;olved, after having filled my Table, to engrave on the Door of my Pri&s;on an Account of my mo&s;t re|markable Adventures in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> There you may read, that I was refu&s;ed a Barber, le&s;t I &s;hould make U&s;e of his Razor to cut my own Throat; and that they would not allow me a Phy&s;ician, becau&s;e he might have cured me, and &s;aved my Life. The&s;e two Incidents occa&s;ioned me to propo&s;e the Riddle of a Man, who could neither live, nor dye. And I was in reality in the Ca&s;e of that Per&s;on, to whom a <HI>Ga&s;coon</HI> &s;aid, If you draw near, I &s;hall kill you; and if you go back, you are a dead Man. This unhappy Man could, in &s;o great an Extremity, no Way avoid the imminent Danger, without becom|ing invi&s;ible, which was likewi&s;e the Advice the <HI>Ga&s;coon</HI> gave him. As this Behaviour of the <HI>Mu&s;|covites,</HI> in Regard to me, was a very evident Proof of their Barbarity, I re&s;olved, in order to perpetuate the Memory thereof, to addre&s;s the following Lines to their Secretaries:<Q><L>Signori Secretari,</L>
<L>Che il Barbiero negate,</L>
<L>Ed il Medico non date,</L>
<L>Siete Cervelli rari.</L>

<L>Ignorate e&s;&s;er forza que&s;ta Porta</L>
<L>Aperta o chiu&s;a &s;ia</L></Q></P>
<P>It is a Phenomenon, &s;omewhat &s;trange, to be expo&s;ed to peri&s;h by Hunger, and as this was my Ca&s;e in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> I thought an Occurrence of that kind de&s;erved to be tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity. The&s;e are the Ver&s;es I compo&s;ed on that Subject:<Q><L>Signori Secretari, dite un puoco</L>
<L>Per chi voi mi prendete?</L>
<L>Se per uomo: O per &s;pirto: &s;e &s;on tale,</L>

Any one be&s;ides my &s;elf, would have taken Pains to broach Invectives again&s;t the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> but to tell you the Truth, I thought them unworthy of my Anger. An Affair happened, in the mean Time, at which, tho ludicrous enough, I could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Indignation. The Matter was this:</P>
<P>As my Confinement begun to be irk&s;ome to me, not a Day pa&s;&s;ed that I did not make &s;ome &s;erious Reflections on the Motives, that could induce the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> to keep me &s;o long clo&s;ed between four Walls. I thought, that they begun to forget me, and re&s;olved to &s;eek &s;ome Method of making my &s;elf the Subject of Publick Di&s;cour&s;e. My Beard appeared mo&s;t proper to awaken their Minds, and to give the Alarm to my whole Guard. It had,
<PB N="91" REF="324">
for &s;ome Time, been of a frightful Length. I daily ob&s;erved the Clerks who came into my Chamber, telling one another, that I was not unlike a <HI>Tartar.</HI> As I &s;hould rather choo&s;e to re&s;emble a <HI>Tartar,</HI> than a <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> this Compari&s;on gave me no great Offence. In order to convince them of my entire Indifference as to all their Railleries, on my Beard, I &s;ometimes told them, that, if <HI>Peter</HI> I. had met me in his Dominions, I &s;hould have met but with a bad Reception. I even made &s;ome Ver&s;es, and en|graved them on my Table, by which I gave them to under&s;tand, that my Beard was &s;o far from ren|dering me dejected, and giving me the Air of a Criminal, that it added to my Courage and Re&s;o|lution. I frequently talked in this Strain, and to confirm what I &s;aid, the more, I added the&s;e Words:
<Q><L>Barbatum hoc crede Magi&s;trum</L>
<L>Dicere.</L></Q>
I took, however, the Re&s;olution of cutting off my Beard, and I even intended to give them Notice of it, notwith&s;tanding the Indifference I expre&s;&s;ed a|bout it. You know, I always wear on my Arm one of tho&s;e Stones, &s;o famed in the Writings of the Learned, which ought, if I had been &s;omewhat more credulous, to have been in greater E&s;teem with me, during the Cour&s;e of my Adventures. Having called my Corporal, I &s;hewed him the Stone, pro|te&s;ting, that, if he did not in&s;tantly &s;end me a Bar|ber, I would cau&s;e a Genius, whom I pretended to have at Command, and to keep inclo&s;ed there, to come immediately, and &s;have me. At hearing the&s;e Words, he &s;eemed to be in a Maze, and, ha|ving alternatively ca&s;t his Eyes on me and my Stone, trembling, replied, that he would carry my Me&s;|&s;age to his Officers, and return immediately with their An&s;wer. At his return, he told me, I mu&s;t
<PB N="92" REF="325">
have a little more Patience, and that it was &s;till thought improper, to grant my Reque&s;t. Di&s;&s;a|tisfied with this repeated Refu&s;al, I directly re&s;ol|ved to perform the Office of a Barber my &s;elf. No &s;ooner were my Guard intent upon &s;omething el&s;e, than I took my Sci&s;&s;ars, which &s;upplied the want of a Razor, and &s;oon after &s;hewed my &s;elf again to the Corporal, without a Beard. His A&s;toni&s;hment was beyond Expre&s;&s;ion; he was in a perfect Rap|ture.</P>
<P>I ea&s;ily fore&s;aw, that I mu&s;t arm my &s;elf with Courage again&s;t the Con&s;equences, which this Af|fair might produce, and be prepared for all Events. As nobody appeared all that Day, I concluded it gave them little or no Concern. But was told by my Guard, the next Morning, that my Beard had cau&s;ed a great Di&s;turbance, and that they them&s;elves expec|ted to be puni&s;hed, for not ob&s;erving my Actions more narrowly. By their Di&s;cour&s;e I perceived, they had no thoughts of my having Sci&s;&s;ars, and that I &s;hould certainly be e&s;teemed an arrant Sorce|rer. The Reluctance I had of pa&s;&s;ing for a Magi|cian, and &s;eeing my Guard unde&s;ervedly la&s;hed, made me frankly own I had a Pair of Sci&s;&s;ars, and had made U&s;e of them, to cut off my Beard. An univer&s;al Alarm en&s;ued, the Clerks in the Anti-Chamber made it the whole Subject of their Di&s;|cour&s;e, and looked upon this Trifle, as a Matter of the utmo&s;t Importance. The Noi&s;e, this Affair made, gave me but little Unea&s;ine&s;s, but I was highly &s;urprized, when the Sergeant of my Guard, the Corporal, and &s;even or eight Soldiers, came, with their Swords drawn, into my Chamber. The Sight of this effeminate Troop was neverthele&s;s &s;o far from terrifying me, that I prepared for a vigo|rous Re&s;i&s;tance, in Ca&s;e of an Attack.</P>
<P>The Sergeant broke Silence, and demanded my Sci&s;|&s;ars, but all the An&s;wer I gave him, was, that I
<PB N="93" REF="326">
did not under&s;tand him. I made the &s;ame Reply to the Corporal and Soldiers, who likewi&s;e made the &s;ame Demand. In vain they made various Signs, for me to apprehend their Meaning, and the Sergeant, in particular, put his Fingers to his Whiskers, to &s;ignify that they de&s;ired to have the Sci&s;&s;ars, with which I had cut off my Beard. They went out of my Room, when I ordered them to fetch me an Inter|preter, but returned a quarter of an Hour after, at|tended by a much larger Number of Soldiers. They found me &s;itting, and, approaching me, repeated their former Demand. I de&s;ired them, in plain Terms, to retire, and &s;ignified that I was not &s;uffici|ently ver&s;ed in the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Tongue, to make them any An&s;wer. The Drawer of my Table being half open, one of the&s;e Men of War, more bold than the re&s;t, very in&s;olently put in his Hand. I was go|ing at the very In&s;tant, to &s;hut the Drawer, and pinch his Hand, but he deprived me of this Plea|&s;ure, by withdrawing it very &s;ea&s;onably. I got up, at the &s;ame Time, &s;omewhat ha&s;tily, and, having called my Guard, made Signs to them, immediate|ly to rid me of this ra&s;cally Crew. Thus ended the Uproar, occa&s;ioned by my Sci&s;&s;ars. The <HI>Italian</HI> Comedians could, I believe, hardly pre&s;ent a Piece, which would afford the <HI>Czarina</HI> more Plea&s;ure, than this, and, had that Prince&s;s known, that there was a Theatre open &s;o near her, where her own Subjects acted &s;uch diverting Parts, I am pretty well a&s;&s;ured, my Pri&s;on would have been honoured with Her Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence. You &s;ee, Sir, I am as good as my Word, I promi&s;ed you &s;omething ludi|crous, and you have no Rea&s;on to complain of any Want of it in this Letter. I leave it to your Judg|ment, after you have peru&s;ed it. As I have already entertained you with &s;ome Ver&s;es, which I made, when my Reque&s;t for a Barber met with a Refu&s;al, it is but ju&s;t I &s;end you &s;ome others, which I carved
<PB N="94" REF="327">
on my Table, when I was rid of my Beard. They were conceived in the&s;e Words:<Q><L>Signori Secretari</L>
<L>Perche alla vo&s;tra Barba</L>
<L>Mi &s;on fatta la Barba,</L>
<L>Voi fate del rumore?</L>
<L>Opetere del Cielo</L>
<L>E che! quivi tra voi non &egrave; perme&s;&s;e,</L>
<L>Ne pur &s;trappar&s;i il pelo!</L></Q></P>
<P>But it's Time to conclude, the Farce is already too long, I begin to be tired with it, and fear it will have the &s;ame Effect on you: I ought rather to have recollected the Proverb:
<Q><L>Li Jochi &s;on belli, quando &s;on corti.</L></Q>
To retaliate your Lo&s;s of Time, in the Peru&s;al of &s;o many bad <HI>Italian</HI> Ver&s;es, I &s;hall conclude this Letter with a Line or two of good <HI>Latin,</HI> and &s;o bid you farewel.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THIS is already my &s;eventh Letter, tho I am but come to the fourth Month of my Impri&s;onment. If I go on thus, I very much fear, I &s;hall be obliged <HI>centuriam tibi dare,</HI> which will not only prove te|dious to you, but likewi&s;e far exceed my Reckon|ing. But tell me, dear Sir, what Cour&s;e can I take? For I &s;ee no Po&s;&s;ibility of being more conci&s;e. You, on the one Hand, make pre&s;&s;ing Demands for an exact and circum&s;tantial Account of what befals me; and the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> on the other Side, furni&s;h me daily with fre&s;h Adventures. The fol|lowing is a very &s;ingular one.</P>
<P>Towards the End of <HI>February,</HI> a Per&s;on came into my Pri&s;on, who, having &s;aluted me in <HI>French,</HI> with a Compliment from Mr. <HI>De L'I&s;le</HI> and his Spou&s;e, laid a Parcel of Linnen, with &s;ome Wine, and &s;e|veral other Provi&s;ions, upon my Table. The Joy I felt, at &s;eeing a Per&s;on, with whom I could conver&s;e, was of a &s;hort Duration. I had hardly Time, to tell him, how much I was obliged to that Gentleman, and his Lady, for the Kindne&s;&s;es I received from them, and, that I was a&s;hamed to &s;ee their Genero&s;ity &s;o much tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed upon. The Ca&s;e was this; having given &s;ome Linnen to the Soldiers, to get it wa&s;hed and mended for me, they had thought proper to carry it to this Lady, who was &s;o kind, as to add thereto &s;everal other Things, which &s;he thought I might &s;tand in Need of. She had ordered one of her Servants to deli|ver the Parcel him&s;elf, being &s;en&s;ible, that if it
<PB N="96" REF="329">
had fallen into other Hands, I &s;hould have been robbed of a good Part of her Benevolence. You will, Sir, undoubtedly be &s;urprized, that the Ser|vant, &s;hould be &s;uffered to &s;peak to me, and to give me that Parcel, which had not been vi&s;ited either by a Secretary, or by any of the Guard. Was I then no longer the &s;ame Pri&s;oner of State, who&s;e Steps were to be narrowly ob&s;erved, and who was to be guarded with the utmo&s;t Rigour? Was I not the &s;ame Per&s;on, who&s;e Reque&s;t for a Barber had been refu&s;ed, and who could not obtain the Liberty of u&s;ing a Knife, or Fork? Yes, I was the &s;ame, but the grand Motive, which induced the <HI>Mu&s;co+vites</HI> to act, on this Occa&s;ion, otherwi&s;e, with Re|gard to me, was this. If the&s;e &s;ordid Wretches had furni&s;hed the&s;e Provi&s;ions, and cau&s;ed my Lin|nen to be wa&s;hed them&s;elves, it would have co&s;t them very near the Value of a Ruble; a Sum which to them appeared con&s;iderable enough, <HI>ut &s;ilerent leges,</HI> and they were willing to leave the Care of it to any one, who would be at the Ex|pence. The Truth of what I here affirm, is &s;o very certain, that when, in the Sequel, I de&s;ired any Thing, that they thought too dear, I was obliged to have Recour&s;e to Mrs. <HI>De L'I&s;le,</HI> who never failed of &s;ending her Servant immediately.</P>
<P>This In&s;tance may &s;erve to give you an Idea of the Sordidne&s;s of the <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI> and at the &s;ame Time will &s;hew you the Nece&s;&s;ity, I lie un|der, of de&s;cending to tho&s;e Particulars, to give you a perfect In&s;ight into the Character of the Nation. A different Inducement, or rather a Sen&s;e of Gra|titude, prompts me to mention two &s;mall Birds, which one of my Guard made me a Pre&s;ent of, and no &s;ooner had I them, than I &s;et them at Liberty, to fly about my Room. They &s;oon grew familiar, and convinced me, that Man is not the only Crea|ture, endued with Rea&s;on. With Submi&s;&s;ion to
<PB N="97" REF="330">
the Gentlemen of the <HI>Carte&s;ian</HI> Sect, I could by no Means believe them to be meer Pieces of Ma|chinery. I di&s;covered in them a Genius, the Faculty of Rea&s;on, and a certain engaging Car|riage, which Men are not Ma&s;ters of. I may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that I was charmed with their Company, and that they gave me many agreeable Hours. They were continually about me, and made me a Thou&s;and pretty Tenders of their Affection. I may venture to affirm, without being too profu&s;e in their Prai&s;e, that many <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are their In|feriours; I mean, with regard to their Rea&s;on, Manners, and certain Pa&s;&s;ions, which I may call hu|mane, and which I never had the good Fortune to experience in any one of my Guard. This innocent Couple, no longer able to &s;ee the Brutality of my Attendants, quitted my Pri&s;on at la&s;t, and left me alone in Captivity. I loved them too well, not to allow them a Place among my Poetical Com|po&s;itions, or to neglect their due Encomium, but I omit it here, to go on to another Subject.</P>
<P>I have already told you, that I carved my Ver|&s;es on the Table and Door, and that both were &s;oon filled with Fragments of Poetry. Weary of this Amu&s;ement, I re&s;olved to &s;pend my Time &s;omewhat more u&s;efully. I had, as I ob&s;erved above, a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Almanack, which is a Book of a pretty large Size; and be&s;ides this I had a Pocket Book, and a Silver Pencil. My Almanack lay open before me one Day, when by Chance I di&s;co|vered a Leaf of blank Paper in it, which I re&s;olved to write upon with my Pencil. I directly made a Tri|al, and &s;ucceeded to my Wi&s;h. I held my Pa|per to the Light, whenever I de&s;ired to read what I had written, and every Character appeared as di&s;tinct, as if I had written them with Ink. Thus may a Pri&s;on be &s;ometimes the Mother of Inven|tion. My mi&s;tru&s;tful Guard, in the mean Time,
<PB N="98" REF="331">
being highly &s;urprized, to &s;ee me thus employed, drew near, from Time to Time, to examine my Actions; but as they &s;aw Nothing, but the Blank Paper, and I had neither Pen nor Ink, which were forbidden me, they &s;uffered me to go on without Interruption, and I was &s;o expeditious, that all the Paper was &s;oon filled. There was a large Quan|tity in my Room: But it was tied up and &s;ealed, according to the Cu&s;tom of the Country, and the Soldiers had Orders to take Care of it. I found Means, however, to get &s;ome of it, without be|ing di&s;covered, and laid up &s;o good a Store, that I found I had &s;ufficient to fini&s;h what I had begun. A Shipwrack unfortunately deprived me of all the&s;e Memoirs, which would have been excellent Materials for the Hi&s;tory of my Adventures, and hence it is, that my Letters are &s;o dull, and writ|ten in &s;o incorrect a Stile.</P>
<P>But what will you think of my Temerity, in &s;tealing Paper, and breaking open Seals, which, in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> is looked upon as a capital Crime? As for the Paper, I thought my &s;elf entitled to it, to repair the Lo&s;s I had &s;u&s;tained of my own, which I had been robbed of at <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> and Part of my Cloaths, which they had thought proper to deprive me of. I confe&s;s, that, had I been di&s;covered in breaking open the Seals, it might have fared hard with me: For in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> you mu&s;t know, every Thing is &s;ealed, Hou&s;es, Shops, Ware-Hou&s;es, Chambers, Doors and Windows. There is but one Thing, which in this Country it is not cu&s;tomary to &s;eal, tho they do it in <HI>Italy,</HI> where Jealou&s;y is car|ried too great a Length. I leave you to gue&s;s my Meaning. The Manner of &s;ealing up Papers in <HI>Mu&s;|covy</HI> is very &s;ingular. They take a little Piece of yellow Wax between their Fingers, which they ap|ply to a twi&s;ted Piece of Packthread, and then put a Seal to it, on which it would be pretty dif|ficult
<PB N="99" REF="332">
to di&s;cern any Impre&s;&s;ion. You find, how|ever, People every where, who are entru&s;ted with the Care of tho&s;e Papers, thus negligently &s;ealed, are very watchful of them. Nothing is more ea&s;y, in &s;pite of all the&s;e Precautions, than to learn the Secrets of the State. Should ever a fatal Star lead you to an Amba&s;&s;y in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> you need only previou&s;ly con&s;ult me, and may rely on my pointing out to you the nece&s;&s;ary Means of being &s;oon apprized of them. I &s;hall even in&s;truct you how to get all the Writings out of the Secretary's Office, and re-place them, without any Danger of being detected. A Gla&s;s of Brandy, or half a Ruble, are Bribes &s;ufficient to gain any Clerk in the Office.</P>
<P>The Soldiers on Guard are &s;eldom over careful in the Di&s;charge of their Duty: They are almo&s;t always &s;noring, never acquainted with their Orders, and ever ready to &s;ubmit to the fir&s;t that are given them, by any one. But what is yet wor&s;e, the&s;e Wretches are ince&s;&s;antly Drunk, which gives Oc|ca&s;ion to continual Quarrels, and to that Di&s;order, which reigns among them. I have frequently &s;een, at one Time, half a Dozen Clerks in Irons, for Neglect of Duty, which neverthele&s;s could not put a &s;top to their indecent Mirth. Iron is very cheap in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and for the lea&s;t Neglect, the guilty Per&s;on is &s;o loaded with it, that he cannot &s;tir.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, I was buried in Oblivion, and my Relea&s;ement &s;eemed to be no longer thought of. As I was determined to &s;trive, by all the Means I could invent, to effect my Deliverance from this unhappy State, I re&s;olved to write a Petition to the Mini&s;ters. For this I made u&s;e of a little Pen, which I fixed at the End of my Pencil. This happily &s;ucceeded, without the Privity of my Guard; and I may &s;ay, that I often &s;hewed them, <HI>Candida de nigris, &amp; de candentibus atra.</HI> One need not be a Conjurer, to impo&s;e on the&s;e People.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="333">
In my Petition to the Mini&s;ters, I humbly en|treated them, as I had been &s;o long impri&s;oned, without being able to conceive the Motives of &s;o rigorous and tedious a Detention, to allow me, at lea&s;t, to draw up my Vindication in Writing. If I was found guilty, I willingly &s;ubmitted to the Forfeiture of my Life; but in Ca&s;e I appeared in|nocent, as I hoped to convince them I was, I beg|ged they would u&s;e their Intere&s;t with her Maje&s;ty for my Relea&s;ement. The next Difficulty, after I had drawn up this Petition, was, to convey it to the Hands of the Mini&s;ters, which was no very ea&s;y Matter. I knew not, at that Time, whether tho&s;e Gentlemen mu&s;t be directly applied to. I had indeed often heard of Secretaries and Senators; but I per&s;i&s;ted &s;till, that my Affairs were only cogni&s;a|ble before Empre&s;s and her Mini&s;ters. The Di&s;|dain, I had, on &s;everal Occa&s;ions, expre&s;&s;ed for the Senate, did, perhaps, protract my Captivity. But I could never prevail upon my &s;elf to change my Sentiments on that Head, and even, when my Mi|&s;ery drew towards a Cri&s;is, I implored the Protection of the <HI>Czarina</HI> only, without making the lea&s;t mention of the Senate, or the Council.
<Q><L>Tantum licentiae dabat innocentia.</L></Q></P>
<P>As I did not immediately meet with an Oppor|tunity of pre&s;enting my Petition, I prepared, in the mean Time, for the Execution of a fre&s;h Project. I had, for &s;ome Time, been troubled with a Rheum in my Head, and, as my <HI>Eau des Carmes</HI> was locked up in my Trunk, I re&s;olved to get it open, in order to come at &s;ome. The Matter at fir&s;t ap|peared not very ea&s;y, by rea&s;on of the Padlock and Seal, neither of which I dur&s;t venture to touch. Having, in the mean Time, narrowly viewed the Trunk, it appeared to be made only of &s;everal
<PB N="101" REF="334">
Planks, joined together without Nails, and that by the Help of a Piece of Iron I might ea&s;ily take one of them off. This, therefore, or &s;omething like it, was my next Want, which I &s;upplied in the following Manner. Seeing my Guard very bu|&s;y one Day at making a Fire in the Stove, and taking great Pains to cut little Pieces of Wood with their Swords, I told them, that an Ax would be much more convenient for that Purpo&s;e; and that they &s;hould endeavour to procure one. They had Sen&s;e enough, on that Occa&s;ion, to apprehend, that I was in the right, but replied, that I mu&s;t demand that Uten&s;il of the Sergeant. As I was not the be&s;t &s;atisfied with this Officer, who now never came near me, I an&s;wered, he was a Ra&s;cal, and that I de&s;ired to have nothing to do with him. I gave them, at the &s;ame Time, half a Ruble, and ordered them to go and buy an Ax. I was &s;oon obeyed; for they &s;tick at nothing, when Money is in the Ca&s;e. Be plea&s;ed likewi&s;e here to ob|&s;erve the Folly of my Guard. I &s;hould without fail have met with a Refu&s;al, had I demanded a Knife or Fork, and yet they buy an Ax and entru&s;t it in my Hands, without Difficulty. You will, perhaps, a&s;k, whence proceeds this Difference? Be|cau&s;e the Ax was not &s;pecified in their Bede-roll. It was not one of tho&s;e Things, I had been denied the U&s;e of; and it was be&s;ides to be of Service to them&s;elves. But as the Fear of my cutting my Throat induced them to refu&s;e me a Knife, had they not the &s;ame Room to apprehend I might &s;plit my Scull with the Ax, or employ it again&s;t them, if an Op|portunity offered? Hence you may judge of the Perver&s;ene&s;s of the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now tell you, in what Manner I executed both the Projects I had formed. If I mi&s;take not, it was on the 18th of <HI>March.</HI> But &s;ince I mention the 18th Day, I mu&s;t take Notice of an Ob&s;erva|tion
<PB N="102" REF="335">
I made, which appears to me pretty &s;ingular. Have you not, in the Peru&s;al of my Letters, found that all the remarkable Epochs of my Adventures happened preci&s;ely on that Day? I was carried to the <HI>Czarina's</HI> Palace on the 18th of <HI>December:</HI> It was the 18th of <HI>January,</HI> when I was allowed to write, and, in the Sequel, you will find, that the mo&s;t remarkable Adventures I met with, always happened on the 18th Day of the Month. I wi&s;h &s;ome one could account for this Phenomenon. The Number 9 has, I know, beeen formerly regarded by all Nations as a my&s;terious Number, for which they have always had a great Veneration: Whe|ther our modern Cabali&s;ts are &s;till of the &s;ame Opi|nion, I know not; but, in Regard to the Num|ber 18, I never heard, that it had any my&s;terious Meaning, and a&s;&s;ure you, that to me the Di&s;co|very is entirely new. Can you imagine this to be the bare Effect of Chance? It will not be fo|reign to my Subject, here to ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Mu&s;|covites,</HI> who are &s;uper&s;titious even to an Exce&s;s, have always endeavoured to improve the extravagant Fancies of the Ancients, and hence it is, that, of two nines, they have made one 18.</P>
<P>The 18th of <HI>March</HI> was the Day, on which I was ordered to be carried to another Pri&s;on. As I feared this Removal would deprive me of an Opportunity of pre&s;enting my Petition, in the Man|ner I had propo&s;ed, the News of it gave me &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s. My Departure was &s;o very abrupt, that they allowed me no Time to make many Re|flections, and I was obliged to take <HI>Con&s;ilium in arena.</HI> I was e&s;corted by a Troop of Soldiers, and by my Guard, headed by their Sergeant. No &s;ooner was I brought into a Chamber, crowded with People, than I pulled my Petition out of my Pocket, and cry|ing out aloud, that every one might hear me, gave it to the Sergeant of my Guard, charging him to car|ry
<PB N="103" REF="336">
it immediately to the <HI>Czarina's</HI> Council. A &s;u|perior Officer, who was probably in &s;ome neighbour|ing Chamber, terrified at the Noi&s;e, in&s;tantly ap|peared, and being informed of the Occa&s;ion, took it, and carried it into the Chamber, where the Senate was a&s;&s;embled. After my Petition was delivered, I was for retiring, but they forced was to wait a Quar|ter of an Hour longer; and the Officer, in the mean Time, returning, gave me my Papers back a|gain, and would force me to take them. Enraged at the Fellow's Ob&s;tinacy, and having before had Rea|&s;on to be dis&s;atisfied with him, I gave him a Blow on the Hand, which cau&s;ed the Paper to fall on the Ground, and then leaving the Place abruptly, threat|ned him with Her Imperial Maje&s;ty's Di&s;plea&s;ure, if he refu&s;ed to convey the Petition to her Hands.</P>
<P>On my Arrival in my new Pri&s;on, I &s;et about the Project I had formed, of opening my Trunk, and taking from thence what I mo&s;t wanted. To &s;ucceed the better, I gave my Guard &s;ome Employ|ment, and for my Part, I was bu&s;ied in making a Cage for my Birds. Thus was I working, Ax in Hand, to cut a Plank, which I had laid upon my Trunk. You may ea&s;iy &s;uppo&s;e, that, at Times, I applied my Axe to my Trunk, to open it, and con&s;equently that all my Blows were not &s;pent on that Plank. My Guard &s;upplied me with what other Tools I &s;till &s;tood in Need of, and, with their Help, I &s;oon compa&s;&s;ed my Ends. Having thrown my Cloak-Bag, and &s;ome other Things, on the Trunk, I &s;lid off the Plank, which I had loo&s;ened, and immediately took out the <HI>Eau des Carmes,</HI> and whatever came fir&s;t to Hand. It happened very luckily, that I could fix the Plank in the Manner it was in before, and afterwards, as ea&s;ily, loo&s;en it again, to take out of my Trunk whatever I want|ed. Thus was I re&s;tored to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my own; and could even, in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, have
<PB N="104" REF="337">
armed my &s;elf with a Sword and Pi&s;tols, to procure my Liberty. The People, I had to do with, had not Courage enough, to defend them&s;elves again&s;t me, and my &s;ingle Fork &s;eemed to me &s;ufficient, to put three or four <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> to the Flight. The World would have an Opinion, very different, from that which <HI>Europe</HI> has for &s;ome Time entertained of this Nation, were they as well acquainted as I am of their Cowardice.</P>
<P>Having thus delivered my Petition, I waited impatiently for the Re&s;ult of it. No An&s;wer was brought that Day, nor the next, but the Day after an Interpreter came into my Chamber, with my Paper in his Hand, and begged I would explain &s;e|veral Lines, which they had not perfectly under|&s;tood. I &s;oon complied with his Reque&s;t, and he promi&s;ed to give a faithful Account of the Pa&s;&s;ages I had cleared up. The &s;ame Man returned an Hour afterwards, to ask, what Means I us'd to write that Petition, and whether I had corrupted my Guard, either with Money or Brandy. I an&s;wered, that I had no Occa&s;ion to have Recour&s;e to either of tho&s;e Expedients; that, as I was in a Room, where thirty or more Clerks were employed, I had not found it difficult to procure Ink, a Pen, and &s;ome Paper, without the Knowledge of my Guard, and that they were not at all privy to it. As the Account, I gave, met with but little Credit, and I was apprehen&s;ive they might puni&s;h the innocent Soldiers, I re&s;olved to di&s;cover the whole Secret. I therefore de&s;ired the Interpreter to let his Ma&s;ters know, that for a Fortnight together, I had written with white Characters, that I might be able to write black ones, for one Quarter of an Hour. The In|terpreter &s;eemed &s;atisfied with my An&s;wer, and went away to make his Report. He returned once more, half an Hour afterwards, to ask me, how I had done to &s;eal my Petition. I &s;hewed him, for his
<PB N="105" REF="338">
Satisfaction, &s;ome Wax I had in my Pocket, with the two Seals hanging at my Watch. Notwith|&s;tanding my pre&s;&s;ing Entreaties to &s;peak to this In|terpreter again, I could never, from that Time, have the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>The Addition which was now made to the Num|ber of my Guard, and the fre&s;h Orders that were given to interrupt all my Proceedings, occa&s;ioned me to think, that, after a Con&s;ultation was held on my Affairs, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary that my Acti|ons &s;hould be more narrowly watched. My only Comfort, on this Occa&s;ion, was, that I could en|joy more Peace, and had a larger Room for my Pri&s;on. I could not, however, account, for the Be|haviour of the Mini&s;ters, with regard to me. I had now been confined four Months at <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> and my Enlargement was not yet thought of. After many Reflections on the State of my Affairs, I fan|cied, that the Intention I had declared, of &s;erving in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> under the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e-Homburg,</HI> had perhaps given the Mini&s;ters Room for &s;ome Su&s;pici|ons. And as that Prince had no Thoughts him&s;elf of going into that Country, till &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s put him upon it, this Notion appeared to be the better grounded. As, on the other Hand, the fundamen|tal Maxim of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Government con&s;i&s;ts in tru&s;ting nobody, and in believing all Mankind to be capable of the mo&s;t villainous Attempts, I had Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that they only detained me &s;o long Pri&s;oner, to inform them&s;elves of the real Mo|tive of my Voyage. Or perhaps, in the pre&s;ent Juncture of Affairs, in <HI>Europe,</HI> they took me for an Emi&s;&s;ary of <HI>France,</HI> or of King <HI>Stani&s;laus.</HI> I am however, not con&s;cious of having done or &s;aid any thing, that could rai&s;e &s;uch a Su&s;picion, and my Behaviour in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> was very much unlike that of a Per&s;on entru&s;ted with &s;ecret Commi&s;&s;ions: I was, neverthele&s;s, &s;ome Time after, informed, that
<PB N="106" REF="339">
I was taken for a Spy of King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> though I never had the Honour of knowing that Prince, or being at all known to him. But let us leave the&s;e Conjectures, which may lead me too far: And in|&s;tead thereof, let me inform you of what pa&s;&s;ed in my new Habitation.</P>
<P>After having opened my Trunk, and taken out of it what I thought nece&s;&s;ary, I re&s;olved to make no longer U&s;e of a wooden Fork, which had been given me, nor to be obliged to borrow a Knife, to cut my Victuals; but made a Shew of my great Fork, and of a Knife, which I had taken out of my Trunk. My Guard &s;eemed &s;urprized at the Sight of the&s;e Things, and I wondered no le&s;s to &s;ee them profoundly &s;ilent. From thence I inferred, that they no longer feared my cutting my Throat, and that all their Care was, to hinder me from wri|ting again. They gave me the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them, every Day, vi&s;it the Seals of my Trunk, to know whether I had tried to open it. By my fre|quent Repre&s;entations, how nece&s;&s;ary it was to have a con&s;tant Eye on tho&s;e Seals, I even invited them to make that Vi&s;it. Thus, after I had tricked them, they &s;erved for Objects of my Ridicule. I was ta|ken up with this Amu&s;ement one Part of the Day, and &s;pent the Remainder of my Time in looking o|ver the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Almanack, which was the only Book, I had left. I was one Day peru&s;ing the Li&s;t of the Potentates of <HI>Europe,</HI> and read, with &s;ome Surprize, the Name of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> III. as King of <HI>Poland.</HI> This News occa&s;ioned me to form vari|ous Conjectures, and gave me a very eager De&s;ire of knowing what had pa&s;&s;ed. I no longer doubted but that the War was kindled in <HI>Poland,</HI> and found, at the &s;ame Time, that the Per&s;on, from whom I had received my chief Intelligence, &s;ince my Arri|val at <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> mu&s;t be perfectly well acquaint|ed with the De&s;igns and Projects of the Court of
<PB N="107" REF="340">
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI> This Per&s;on, whom, I believe, I men|tioned before, had not a little contributed to my ta|king the Re&s;olution of going into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> I had long before &s;u&s;pected, that he re&s;ided at <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> on Account of &s;ome &s;ecret and important Affair, which Su&s;picion was afterwards confirmed by fre&s;h Proofs, and &s;uch, as &s;uffered me no longer to doubt of the Truth of my Conjecture. As he was well ac|quainted with whatever pa&s;&s;ed at the Court of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> he appeared to me the more proper to di&s;charge his Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Tho it was with A&s;toni&s;hment I heard, that King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had acceeded to the Throne of <HI>Poland,</HI> yet I was not ignorant that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> would u&s;e their utmo&s;t Efforts, to effect the Exclu&s;ion of King <HI>Stani&s;laus;</HI> but I could hardly per&s;uade my &s;elf, they would ever have &s;ucceeded. The great Influ|ence the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Court at pre&s;ent has, in the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> does really &s;urprize me, and is what I cannot &s;ufficiently repeat to you. The World has formed of this Monarchy a Notion of Power, which exi&s;ts only in the Fancies of tho&s;e, who have no Knowledge of it. <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> is, I mu&s;t own, of a va&s;t Extent, and I even believe, that neither <HI>Europe,</HI> nor the <HI>Indies,</HI> nor any other Part of the World, con|tains a Country in that Point equal to it. You may judge of this by its Length, if you con&s;ider the Di|&s;tance between <HI>Riga,</HI> and the <HI>Eastern</HI> Extremity of the Continent of <HI>Kamt&s;chatki,</HI> lately di&s;covered; and by the Latitude of it, which extends from the Province of <HI>Gilan,</HI> on the <HI>Southern</HI> Coa&s;ts of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, to the Streights of <HI>Na&s;&s;au.</HI> The pro|digious Extent of this Empire, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a Burthen to it, and renders it (if I may be allowed the Expre&s;&s;ion) heavy and unfit for Motion. If, on the other Hand, we enter into a particular Account of the Parts, of which it is compo&s;ed, we meet with immen&s;e De|&s;arts,
<PB N="108" REF="341">
Mar&s;hes without End, and very large Fo|re&s;ts. It will, therefore, upon an exact Calculation, be found, that <HI>Germany</HI> contains twice as many In|habitants as <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> To this add the Pu&s;illani|mity of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> who are by no Means a People to be dreaded by other Nations.
<Q><L>Nam &s;i homines, vix &s;unt homines hoc nomine digni.</L></Q></P>
<P>Were we to give Credit to what is in&s;erted in cer|tain Gazettes, I know, we &s;hould have Room to be|lieve, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have actually formidable Armies on foot, con&s;i&s;ting of regular Troops. But believe me, Sir, tho&s;e Reports are entirely ground|le&s;s, and only fit to &s;educe the unknowing Part of Mankind. I wi&s;h they would &s;hew me, where all the&s;e Troops are. In the Year 1733, I &s;aw the State of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops, and if they amount at pre&s;ent to 100,000 Men, they mu&s;t have been con&s;iderably augmented. But, &s;uppo&s;ing, that there is actually at pre&s;ent that Number of regular Troops in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> mu&s;t they not nece&s;&s;arily be divided and di&s;tributed into &s;everal Places? You are not ig|norant of the indi&s;pen&s;ible Nece&s;&s;ity they lye under, of keeping always a pretty large Body in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and that a Removal of them from that Country, e|ven in Time of Peace, would be attended with &s;ome Danger. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have of late been pretty well experienced in War, and, &s;hould they happen to make Peace with the <HI>Turks, Koulikan</HI> would, without doubt, undertake the Conque&s;t of tho&s;e fine Provinces, which the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have, by U&s;urpati|on, made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of. What ought we to think of this Behaviour of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> with Regard to the <HI>Per&s;ians?</HI> Under the &s;pecious Pre|tence of lending their Aid to a King, oppre&s;&s;ed by a rebellious Subject, they enter the Country, where they are received like generous Friends, and at the
<PB N="109" REF="342">
&s;ame Time treacherou&s;ly &s;eize whatever they think mo&s;t commodious for them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Body of Troops, which the <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI> cannot avoid maintaining in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> they are obliged to keep another on Foot in the Kingdom of <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> which is &s;urrounded by <HI>Tar|tars,</HI> who are Neighbours they have always Rea|&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive of. The Troubles, that King|dom was &s;o lately involved in, are &s;till fre&s;h in every one's Memory. An handful of Men &s;pread a ge|neral Confu&s;ion, and made terrible Ravages there. Another Motive, that mu&s;t induce the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> to keep Troops in the Kingdom of <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> is, becau&s;e the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Ba&s;kir,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Uffi,</HI> who were antient Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this Country, might other|wi&s;e ri&s;e in Rebellion, &s;ome Time or other, and revenge them&s;elves on the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians.</HI> During my &s;tay at <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> I had an Opportunity of &s;eeing &s;ome of that Nation, and if we may judge by their Phi|&s;iognomy, they do not &s;eem de&s;tined to bow their Necks long to the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Yoke. But let us go back, and &s;top at the River <HI>Don,</HI> where the <HI>Koban Tartars,</HI> who are not far di&s;tant from thence, make frequent Incur&s;ions, and very much mole&s;t the <HI>Mu&s;|covites.</HI> If tho&s;e People are not kept in awe, they may certainly penetrate as far as <HI>Weronezt,</HI> and ven|ture at la&s;t on &s;ome important Enterprize to &s;uccour their Brethren, the <HI>Crim-Tartars.</HI> If we go on in|to the <HI>Ukraine,</HI> we &s;hall find, that Country cannot remain long in the Hands of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> unle&s;s it be &s;ecured by a con&s;iderable Body of good Troops. In tho&s;e Parts the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> mu&s;t have a watchful Eye over the Motions of the <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Crim</HI> and <HI>Budziack-Tartars,</HI> and even of the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> who may, &s;oon or late, ri&s;e in Arms, and, as they have formerly done, withdraw their Allegiance.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, that, if the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> maintain, as they mu&s;t do, a Body of regular Troops, in each
<PB N="110" REF="343">
of tho&s;e Places, and e&s;pecially in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the <HI>Ukraine,</HI> their Army of an hundred thou&s;and Men, will be reduced to a very &s;mall Number. To the&s;e you may add the Troops, which are actually in <HI>Po|land;</HI> 30,000 Men, which they are to &s;end to the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Aid on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and la&s;tly the nume|rous Garri&s;ons, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be kept in mo&s;t of tho&s;e Places, which have been taken from <HI>Sweden.</HI> But, &s;uppo&s;ing, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> had really as many Troops, as they are &s;aid to have, where will they find Money to pay them? The Re|venues of that va&s;t Monarchy do not amount to a|bove ten or twelve thou&s;and Crowns. How is it po&s;&s;ible, with a Sum &s;o incon&s;iderable, to maintain 3, or 400,000 Men by Land, and, be&s;ides this, a formidable Fleet at Sea?</P>
<P>The&s;e Particulars may &s;erve to &s;hew, that I am not mi&s;taken, in exclaiming again&s;t the Rumour &s;pread in <HI>Europe,</HI> of the Power of this Nation. The Gazetteers are excu&s;able, as they publi&s;h tho&s;e Re|ports on a Mi&s;-Information; but what Judgement can we form of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> who, tho thorough|ly acquainted with the State of their Affairs, the Number and Quality of their Troops, and the Weakne&s;s of their Finances, dare to attempt the Ex|ecution of the Projects now on the Carpet? Be|lieve me, Sir, and give me leave to repeat it once more, that they will never obtain the Ends they have in View:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They &s;eem, however, to bid very fair for it, at this time.</NOTE>
<Q><L>Spes improbi&s;&s;imas complectuntur in&s;perata a&s;&s;ecuti.</L></Q></P>
<P>What Projects the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> may have formed for this Campaign, I am wholly ignorant of; but this I know, that they were the la&s;t Year obliged, for the Reinforcement of their Troops, to draw all
<PB N="111" REF="344">
had from their Inland-Countries; In&s;omuch, that none but Invalids remained at <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> tho a con&s;i|derable Body always us'd to be kept on Footthere. At <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> remained only the Guards and two Bat|talions of Pea&s;ants, ju&s;t taken from behind their O|vens; hence it was, that the Number of the ordina|ry Guards could not be compleated, and that even mine was le&s;&s;ened, for I was left in the Hands of three Men, who were not relieved in near two Months.</P>
<P>Their Manner of doing Duty in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> is pret|ty &s;ingular. Tho&s;e, who, like me, have been Eye-Witne&s;&s;es, may have an Idea of the Troops of this Country, and of the Officers, who command them. A Soldier on Duty never knows when he is to be relieved, and, as for the Officers, they are generally ignorant of the fir&s;t Rudiments of War, which tho&s;e of other Countries are &s;o well acquainted with. A Centinel very &s;eldom executes the Orders, he receives from his Sergeant. They never he&s;itate at placing a drunken Soldier on Duty; and fre|quently a whole Guard, Officers, as well as Sol|diers, are drunk, and incapable of attending their Duty. Nothing is more common, than to &s;ee a mutinous Soldier fall to Blows with his Sergeant, and the latter is often obliged to put up with them, without daring to complain. The Quarrels which happen every Day among the Officers or the Soldi|ers, are never terminated otherways, than by Fi&s;ty-Cuffs, or Cudgels; for there is a Law in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> as I ob&s;erved in a former Letter, whereby the Sub|jects are forbid to draw their Swords, which Law is always mo&s;t religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved. The only Thing, which appears laudable, is, that the&s;e Troops are never &s;uffered to be idle, and at <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> I re|member to have &s;een fifteen Battalions employed at a Time, and not a &s;ingle Man remaining at the Corps de Garde. Guards are placed every where,
<PB N="112" REF="345">
and there is not the lea&s;t thing done without &s;uch a Security. Foreign Mini&s;ters, of what Rank &s;o|ever they be, never fail of being attended by &s;ome of them. You may judge, after this, how &s;afely their Money mu&s;t be guarded in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you, that a Commi&s;&s;ioner, who has only a dozen Bags of Copper-Money in his Che&s;t, will at lea&s;t have a Guard of &s;ix Men. Such is the Employ|ment of the greater Part of a large Garri&s;on, whil&s;t the re&s;t are continually occupied in cleaving and cutting Wood for their Fuel. This they call keeping their Troops in Exerci&s;e, and always rea|dy for Battle, and imagine they are performing Wonders!</P>
<P>I could enlarge farther on this Subject, but fear this Letter is already too long. I mu&s;t therefore conclude, Sir, tho I do it with Reluctance, a&s;&s;uring you, that I am, and &s;hall always be, wholly Yours,

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU very ju&s;tly cen&s;ure the Stile of my Let|ters; the Faults are as vi&s;ible to me as to you, but I do not find it &s;o ea&s;y to avoid them. The Rea&s;ons I told you before, which you cannot be ignorant of. My Condition will not allow me to be very nice in the Choice of my Words, nor to give a ju&s;t Turn to my Periods.</P>
<Q><L>Animum, non carmina jacto.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="113" REF="346">
In my la&s;t I informed you, how I was apprized of the War being kindled in <HI>Poland,</HI> and that King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had acceeded to the Throne. The &s;ame Per&s;on told me, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> had in|ve&s;ted <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and that King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> was block'd up in that City. As I neglected no Oppor|tunity of learning the publick News, I heard, that Count <HI>Munich</HI> was departed for the Camp before <HI>Dantzick;</HI> that a large Body of Troops was ordered to march from <HI>Poland;</HI> and that all who were at <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> were to come to <HI>Peter&s;burg.</HI> Orders were even &s;ent to my Guard, to prepare for a March, which I found they were not the be&s;t plea&s;ed with. They were continually ob&s;erv|ing, that a bloody War would &s;oon en&s;ue, that a large Body of <HI>French</HI> Troops was already arrived in <HI>Poland,</HI> and preparing to march directly to <HI>Mo&s;cow.</HI> In vain I repre&s;ented to them the Impo&s;&s;ibility of it, by Rea&s;on of the va&s;t Di&s;tance the <HI>French</HI> are at, they per&s;i&s;ted this News was but too true, and that I ought no longer to doubt it. By their Di&s;|cour&s;e, I perceived, how much they were afraid of coming to blows with the <HI>French.</HI> You mu&s;t know, the Warriors in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> all equally wi&s;h for Peace, and that no one here is a Soldier by Incli|nation. They ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s their Aver&s;ion to War, and that, were they not forced to enter into military Service, they would never do it volun|tarily. If the Officers them&s;elves were allowed to do it, they would certainly re&s;ign their Po&s;ts. From hence you may judge, what Opinion we ought to have of the&s;e Troops.</P>
<P>The Intelligence I received from my Guard &s;erved only to encrea&s;e my De&s;ire of hearing more News; but nothing appeared &s;o difficult, as to find the Means of &s;atisfying my Curio&s;ity. After many Reflections, it came into my Head to &s;end for Mr. <HI>De L'I&s;le</HI>'s Cook, not doubting, but that
<PB N="114" REF="347">
he would give me a thorough Knowledge of every Thing. In order to this, I a&s;ked for &s;everal Things, which I pretended to have urgent Occa&s;ion for, and for which I knew my Guard would not di&s;bur&s;e any Money. This &s;ucceeded to my Wi&s;h. They went immediately to Mr. <HI>De L'I&s;le,</HI> who in&s;tantly &s;ent his Cook with all I a&s;ked for. I acquainted this Man with my earne&s;t De&s;ire of &s;eeing him, to be informed of the Po&s;ture of Affairs in <HI>Europe,</HI> and begged he would vi&s;it me frequently, to impart to me all he might learn. He promi&s;ed faithfully to gratify my De&s;ire, and he was as good as his Word.</P>
<P>By this Means, I was informed of many Things, &s;ome of which were agreeable, while others gave me Unea&s;ine&s;s. The Affection I always bore to Arms revived in me, when I found War declared on all Hands, and this, at the &s;ame Time, made me more &s;en&s;ibly feel the Weight of my Mi&s;eries. But with Plea&s;ure I heard, that the <HI>French</HI> had di&s;|tingui&s;hed them&s;elves from the Beginning of the War, and the Progre&s;s, they had made, did, I mu&s;t own, far exceed my Hopes. I remember to have &s;aid, in a former Conver&s;ation with you, that as the Enemies of <HI>France</HI> could not gain their Ends by a War, they were endeavouring to &s;ub|due that Nation by a Peace. My Conjectures were groundle&s;s, and it is with Joy I find my &s;elf mi&s;taken. Who would ever have thought, that what is the general Cau&s;e of the Decay, and total Subver&s;ion, of the mo&s;t powerful States, could ne|ver produce either of tho&s;e fatal Effects in <HI>France?</HI> Were Luxury and Indolence ever carried to &s;o great an Exce&s;s in any Country in the Univer&s;e, as in this very Kingdom? The <HI>French,</HI> in the mean Time, &s;o immerged in Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, tho&s;e illu&s;trious Youths &s;o intent upon the Finery of their Attire, and &s;o attached to the Pur&s;uit of their Plea&s;ures, have given the mo&s;t evident Proofs of
<PB N="115" REF="348">
their Valour and Bravery, at the Battles of <HI>Par|ina</HI> and <HI>Gua&s;talla,</HI> and at the Siege of <HI>Philip&s;burg.</HI> They may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to have &s;hewn a Prodigy of Valour, and to have acted like Heroes. This Phenomenon is extraordinary, and perhaps without a Precedent. The Reflections I have made on this Subject would lead me too far from my main De&s;ign, &s;hould I undertake to communicate them all to you.</P>
<P>My Thoughts were not however &s;o wholly taken up with the News I heard in my Pri&s;on, to hinder me from con&s;idering &s;eriou&s;ly how to procure my Liberty.</P>
<P>A Month was now pa&s;s'd, &s;ince I pre&s;ented my Petition, and I had as yet received no An&s;wer. I &s;eemed to be buried in Oblivion, and the Mini|&s;ters appeared re&s;olved to let me die in Slavery. They continued to treat me with unprecedented Ri|gour, and I could neither obtain an Interpreter, nor Permi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak to the Mini&s;ters. Whatever Reque&s;t I made was &s;ure to meet with a Refu&s;al. I e&s;teemed it a great Piece of Inju&s;tice, that they &s;o ob&s;tinately denied to &s;ee the Rea&s;ons I had to offer in my Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>As I had &s;ome Room to think, that the Gen|tlemen of the Senate had intercepted my Petition, I re&s;olved to draw up another. The Execution of this Project was attended with &s;ome Difficulty by Rea&s;on of the Orders, which had been given, narrowly to watch my Motions, and of the Num|ber of my Guard which had been augmented. This could not however di&s;courage me from pur&s;uing my De&s;ign. I entru&s;ted my Petition, after I had &s;ealed it, to two Sergeants, whom I charged to carry it in&s;tantly to the <HI>Czarina</HI>'s Council. An of|ficious young Fellow, who came almo&s;t every Mi|nute into my Chamber, to &s;ee whether my Guards had a &s;trict Eye over me, was greatly &s;urprized, when he &s;aw, that I had found Means of writing without being perceived by any one. He &s;wore and made a terrible Uproar, threatning my Guard
<PB N="116" REF="349">
that they &s;hould be puni&s;hed for their Negligence. They a&s;&s;ured him, with horrid Imprecations, that they were not privy to it. After a long Con&s;ul|tation they took my Petition at la&s;t, and promi&s;ed to execute the Commi&s;&s;ion faithfully. The Serge|ants returned, notwith&s;tanding this Promi&s;e, in half an Hour, and gave my Paper to the Soldier who was on Duty, with a reiterated Charge, not to &s;uf|fer me to write any more. This ill Succe&s;s did not di&s;hearten me. My Guard, on their Part, dou|bled their Attention, and even endeavoured to &s;ur|prize me by Stratagems. They pretended to be a&s;leep and watched me through their Cloaks, with which they cover'd their Heads.</P>
<P>This Scene was comical enough, and afforded me much Diver&s;ion. I was extreamly delighted to &s;ee them fall from a feigned Sleep into a real and profound one. I cannot conceive how they came to think of this Expedient. For the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> of all People, are the mo&s;t expert in the Art of Sleep|ing. I may venture to &s;ay, that of all the Nati|ons I know, not one is &s;o &s;ubject to Sleep, as the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are. Not contented with the Night, which, in the Winter-Sea&s;on, is very long, in their Country, they take, throughout the whole Year, an Afternoon's Nap, of &s;everal Hours. This Cu&s;|tom is common to every <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> and 'tis that probably, which makes them &s;o &s;tupid. The whole Life of a Soldier is &s;pent in Eating and Sleeping. They even indulge them&s;elves in the latter, whil&s;t they are on Duty. The Time of their &s;tanding Centry, which is for &s;ix Hours together, is indeed, too long. When an Officer &s;urprizes a Sol|dier a&s;leep, which I have frequently &s;een, he does not make a Crime of it; but only awakens him, by &s;aying, How now, Centry? Are you a&s;leep? How the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Soldiers behave in the Field, I know not; but mo&s;t certain it is, that they can
<PB N="117" REF="350">
never forbear &s;lumbering, if they are &s;everal Hours on Duty. You need not, therefore, wonder, if I could impo&s;e upon my Guard, and find all the Time requi&s;ite, to write a new Petition, without their Knowledge. After having drawn &s;everal Copies, I &s;ealed them, and threw them out of the Window, into a Place, where I &s;aw a great Tho|row-fare. The&s;e Papers were directed to the Em|pre&s;s her&s;elf, but I could never find, that any Thing came of them. This is common in <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI> where it is difficult to obtain Ju&s;tice. <HI>Hos &s;celerum ritus.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot, with any Certainty, impute this to any particular Per&s;on. Shall I accu&s;e the Cabinet-Coun|cil or the Members of the Senate? I have Room to believe them all equally guilty, and the U&s;age I have met with at their Hands, but too plainly proves it. The Rea&s;ons that induce me to attribute it to them, are the&s;e: The Petition, which I &s;ent my &s;elf, as Pri&s;oner of State, to Her Imperial Maje&s;ty's Council, was either intercepted, or com|municated to the Mini&s;ters. If you &s;uppo&s;e it to have fallen into their Hands, may I not rea&s;onably accu&s;e them of the greate&s;t Inju&s;tice, as they would neither give Ear to my oral Remon&s;trances, nor per|mit me to write? But, if my Petition was inter|cepted, may I not conclude, that the Mini&s;try is under no fixed Regulation? Since I was looked up|on as a Per&s;on, entru&s;ted with &s;ome Commi&s;&s;ion, dangerous to the State, my Petition might be pre|&s;umed to contain &s;ome Affairs of the greate&s;t Im|portance. It being, on the other Hand, directed to the Empre&s;s her&s;elf, how dur&s;t they pre&s;ume to open and intercept it? A Proceeding of this Kind can never be in any Nation, where all Laws, di|vine and human, are not trod under Foot. In &s;o unhappy a Situation, my Unea&s;ine&s;s was beyond Expre&s;&s;ion. Thus confined in a Pri&s;on, where
<PB N="118" REF="351">
I was u&s;ed like the mo&s;t vile of Men, I knew not what Means to have Recour&s;e to, to procure my Relea&s;ement. <HI>Quoe res in &s;e neque con&s;ilium, neque modum habet ullum, eam con&s;ilio regere non potes.</HI></P>
<P>As I was not &s;o rigid a Stoic, as to re&s;olve upon &s;pending the Remainder of my Days in a Pri&s;on, a De&s;ire after Liberty prompted me to think of new Expedients to free my &s;elf from Slavery. I &s;oon formed another Scheme, the Execution of which ap|peared to me very ea&s;y. This was, to kill one of my Guard, who always accompanied me alone to an Apartment, whither I went to ea&s;e Nature. I continued to think &s;eriou&s;ly of executing this De|&s;ign, as de&s;perate as it was. My Sword was, as I mentioned before, at my own Di&s;po&s;al, and nothing &s;eemed to me le&s;s difficult, than to make my E&s;cape from my Pri&s;on, after having given the Blow. The only Ob&s;tacle, I &s;aw, was, how to find a Place in the City to which I might &s;afely retire. I might, in any other Country have relied on a Protection in the Hou&s;e of a foreign Mini&s;ter, in which I could &s;e|curely have taken Refuge; but I knew the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI> too well, not to be acquainted how light they make of the Law of Nations. I re&s;olved, however, as I was de&s;titute of any other Means, to retire to the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian</HI> Envoy, where I propo&s;ed more Safety to my &s;elf, than any where el&s;e. All Matters were already di&s;po&s;ed for an Enterprize &s;o dangerous, and &s;o different from the many others, I had, in vain, attempted, when I begun &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect on the Action, and upon &s;econd Thoughts re|&s;olved to delay it for &s;ome Time. I was &s;hocked at the bare Thought of killing a Man in cold Blood, and prote&s;t, that, had not the Unea&s;ine&s;s cau&s;ed in me by &s;o long an Impri&s;onment, and by the bad Treatment, I met with, from the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> com|pelled me to it, I &s;hould never have formed &s;uch a De&s;ign. I therefore thought it my Duty, patiently
<PB N="119" REF="352">
to bear the Weight of my Mi&s;eries, and to &s;tay for &s;ome other Opportunity of recovering my Liberty, without being obliged to commit a Crime, and without running the Hazard, I was going to expo&s;e my &s;elf to.</P>
<P>I received, in the mean Time, frequent Intelli|gences of what pa&s;&s;ed at the Siege of <HI>Dantzick.</HI> I was informed by my Guard, that their Countrymen &s;trove by all po&s;&s;ible Means to make them&s;elves Ma|&s;ters of that City, and that they hoped to put an End to the War, by &s;eizing the Per&s;on of King <HI>Stani&s;laus.</HI> I could not be prevailed on, as I knew the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops, to believe, that they would ever bring about an Enterprize of that Kind. I imagined, be&s;ides, that, if the City &s;hould not be in a Condition of being defended, it would infallibly be relieved with formidable Succours, and thereby the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> be obliged to retreat. I was told, that <HI>Sweden</HI> was equipping a con&s;iderable Fleet, and that a large Body of Troops was forming in <HI>Finland.</HI> This Step, &s;aid to have been taken by <HI>Sweden,</HI> ap|peared to me very rea&s;onable, and I had many In|ducements to make me give Credit to the&s;e Intelli|gences. And the <HI>Swedes</HI> could in Reality not meet with a more favourable Opportunity, of retrieving the Lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained, and revenging them|&s;elves on the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> Nothing could, in my Opinion, at that Time, be attended with le&s;s diffi|culty than the Execution of this Project. The <HI>Swedes,</HI> needed only to march directly to <HI>Wibourg,</HI> and I am well a&s;&s;ured, that at the fir&s;t Rumour of it at <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> that Capital would &s;oon have been a|bandoned, and the whole Court have retired to <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI></P>
<P>What I here advance is pretty well founded, and I even believe, Sir, it is the only and be&s;t Means that could be taken. My Rea&s;ons are the&s;e: The <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI> had, at the Time I am &s;peaking of, only
<PB N="120" REF="353">
eight or ten Battalions, and one Regiment of Ca|valry, to oppo&s;e the <HI>Swedes;</HI> for herein con&s;i&s;ted all that remained for the <HI>Czarina</HI>'s Guard. Had I not, therefore, Room to think, that a Step like this ought to be taken by <HI>Sweden?</HI> I had formed &s;uch plea&s;ing Hopes of their &s;ucceeding therein, that I had even projected, to be one among them, a&s;|&s;oon as they &s;hould enter <HI>Peter&s;burg.</HI> The Executi|on of this Enterprize would not have been very diffi|cult. I might have cleared the Way for my &s;elf with my Sword and Pi&s;tols. My Guard were not to be greatly feared; and, had I met with any Re|&s;i&s;tance from them, I &s;hould &s;oon have found Means of &s;ubduing them. My Mind was, during &s;ome Time, wholly taken up with the&s;e plea&s;ing Expec|tations: I ob&s;erved through the Windows of my Pri&s;on, what pa&s;&s;ed in the City, and when any one came into my Pri&s;on, I could not di&s;&s;emble my ea|ger De&s;ire of hearing News. My Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es all vani&s;hed in Hopes of &s;eeing this Grand Event. No|thing could have plea&s;ed me more, than to &s;ee the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> upon the Point of quitting their Capital, to avoid the Pur&s;uits of an Enemy, ju&s;tly enraged. With Plea&s;ure I view'd the approaching Moment, when they would be obliged to renounce all their great Enterprizes.</P>
<P>My Conjectures, Sir, proved, however, ground|le&s;s, my Hopes were vain, and the Event has but too plainly demon&s;trated, how gro&s;ly I was mi&s;ta|ken. You will undoubtedly &s;ay, that my Imagi|nations were at that Time, like tho&s;e of a Per&s;on, in the other World. I confe&s;s, I was deceived, but who would ever have believed, that the Affairs of <HI>Poland</HI> would have turned out to the Advantage of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians?</HI> Am I the only one, who entertained the Notions, I then did? What were your Thoughts, Sir? Could you ever have imagined, that the City of <HI>Dantzick</HI> would &s;urrender to the <HI>Mu&s;covites?</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="354">
That the <HI>Swedes</HI> would continue inactive? And that all the other Potentates &s;hould not make the lea&s;t Attempt to oppo&s;e the unju&s;t Preten&s;ions of the <HI>Mu&s;covites?</HI> I cannot but continue in my Sur|prize, when I con&s;ider this general Inactivity of the Re&s;t of the <HI>Northern Princes.</HI> Are then the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who were formerly &s;o warlike a People, now dege|nerated? Could they ever have met with a more favourable Juncture to retrieve their Lo&s;&s;es? The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> being &s;till the very &s;ame, as they were in the Times of <HI>Charles</HI> XII, their declared Enemy, they had nothing to fear from that Quarter. Let them but recollect the famous Battle of <HI>Narva,</HI> where a handful of valiant <HI>Swedes,</HI> routed an Army of one Hundred Thou&s;and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>But you will perhaps a&s;k, is there no Difference between the pre&s;ent <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops, and tho&s;e, who fought the Battle of <HI>Narva?</HI> There is, I mu&s;t own, &s;ome, but let us only examine, wherein it con&s;i&s;ts. The pre&s;ent <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Soldiers are better cloathed, and provided with better Arms than in the la&s;t War; but they are, in every other Re&s;pect, &s;till the &s;ame Men, and have neither more Courage, nor more Experience to boa&s;t of. Believe me, had the <HI>Swedes</HI> put it to the Trial, the Perdition of the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> would have been inevitable. They were far from being in a Condition to oppo&s;e an Enemy, by whom they had &s;o often been conquered, and, at the &s;ame Time, carry on a War with the <HI>Poles.</HI> You will, perhaps, object, that Part of the Troops employed at the Siege of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and &s;ome of tho&s;e who were di&s;per&s;ed in <HI>Poland,</HI> might have been recalled. But, Sir, that Objection can be of no weight with you. All the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops, which are di&s;per&s;ed in <HI>Poland,</HI> are highly nece&s;&s;ary there, and, notwith&s;tanding their large Number, would have been few enough, had not there been Divi&s;ions among the <HI>Poles</HI> them&s;elves. You may
<PB N="122" REF="355">
again object, they had another Body of Troops in the <HI>Ukraine,</HI> which they might have recalled, and placed in the Heart of the Empire. But in this Ca&s;e, how would they have been &s;afe again&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> who threatned them with an In|va&s;ion? Let us even &s;uppo&s;e, that they had re&s;ol|ved to recall tho&s;e Troops, were they not too far di|&s;tant from the Capital, to arrive in Time, and pre|vent its &s;urrender to the Enemy? All the&s;e Things induce me to believe, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> relied on the Faith of the Treaties, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them and <HI>Sweden,</HI> and, that they had been a&s;&s;ured, that no Attempt &s;hould be made, contrary to their In|tere&s;ts. They &s;eem neverthele&s;s to have carried their Confidence too far, and a &s;trong Body of Troops, &s;ent to <HI>Finland,</HI> would have contributed not a little to e&s;tabli&s;h their Alliance with <HI>Sweden,</HI> and to &s;ecure their Frontiers from any In&s;ult. But the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Mini&s;try probably e&s;teemed the&s;e Pre|cautions needle&s;s, and is undoubtedly ignorant, that <HI>Utcunque &s;e res inclinat, ita ambulant foedera.</HI> They are &s;o elate on their Pro&s;perity, and their Vanity is &s;o excited by a Succe&s;s, only owing to Chance, that they forget their Intere&s;ts in Matters of the greate&s;t Importance. <HI>Melius, pejus, pro&s;it, ob&s;it, nil vident, ni&s;i quod lubet.</HI></P>
<P>I need not expatiate on the Event of this Affair, but be that as it will, it mu&s;t be allowed, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have on this Occa&s;ion expo&s;ed their So|vereign and the whole Nation, to too great a Dan|ger. Had <HI>Sweden</HI> more narrowly watched her In|tere&s;ts, <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> mu&s;t have yielded to her &s;u|perior Power, and none of the great Projects, for|med by the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> would have taken Place. The Admiralty of <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> you know, takes Charge of whatever relates to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Maritime A&s;&s;airs. If therefore this Capital had fallen into the Hands of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> of what U&s;e would not <HI>Cron|&s;tadt,</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="356">
with all the Ships which lye there, have been to them? The taking of this City only, would, I am well a&s;&s;ured, have been attended by the Lo&s;s of all the Conque&s;ts the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have made, and con&s;e|quently have driven them back within tho&s;e Bounds, to which it is the Intere&s;t of &s;everal Princes, if not of all <HI>Europe,</HI> to confine them. Hence you may &s;ee, what Danger the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to by an unheard of Negligence, and by not fore&s;eeing a Storm, which might have fallen upon, and overwhelmed them. Had the Admini|&s;tration of Affairs been in the Hands of the native <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> as it is of Foreigners, &s;o notorious a Blunder would not have &s;urprized me, and I could even have alledged the true Cau&s;e of &s;uch a Proce|dure.</P>
<P>I believe, I have already, in &s;ome of my former Letters, ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> could never approve of any of the Regulations made by <HI>Peter</HI> the Great, their Sovereign, and that the mo&s;t honourable Employments are &s;uch a Burthen to them, that they never accept of them but with the utmo&s;t Reluctance. Mo&s;t of them very loudly de|clare, that the Obligation they are under, of &s;er|ving, be it by Sea, or Land, is only an Addition to their Slavery. In this Way of thinking, which &s;hews their Cowardice and Indolence, they look on their Navy, and all the Conque&s;ts they have made, as the two principal Sources of all the Evils they labour under. They wi&s;h for nothing &s;o earne&s;tly, as a con&s;iderable Change in the State, which may &s;ubvert all the Innovations, and enable them to lead a lazy, inactive Life. Believe me, what I here advance, is far from being a Paradox, for nothing would be ea&s;ier to methan to evince the Truth of it. I remember, that, during the Siege of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> itwas a general Wi&s;h, with every one, that it might not be taken. The Hatred they bear to the Foreigners,
<PB N="124" REF="357">
who formed this Project, and e&s;pecially to him, who was entru&s;ted with the Execution of it, contri|buted not a little to their being &s;o &s;ingular in their Wi&s;hes; but the principal Object of their De&s;ires was, for ever to quit a Country, which they great|ly abhor, and to return, into their ancient native Country, where they might offer them&s;elves a Sa|crifice to Fire and Lazine&s;s, their favourite Idols.</P>
<P>You may conclude, Sir, from what I have &s;aid, how rea&s;onably my Hopes were founded, of recei|ving from the <HI>Swedes</HI> an Opportunity of recovering my Liberty. My Di&s;appointment mu&s;t, therefore, be imputed to my evil Stars, and to the Inactivity of the <HI>Swedes.</HI> Whil&s;t I was flattering my &s;elf with the&s;e vain Hopes, I happened to think of an Expe|dient of cau&s;ing my &s;elf to be taken Notice of, and preventing my being buried in eternal Oblivion, which you will think very odd. As I was one Day leaning on my Window, with my Mind employed on a thou&s;and various Thoughts, I &s;aw the <HI>Czarina</HI> at a Di&s;tance, with a large Number of Attendants, pa&s;&s;ing through a Street, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily lead her clo&s;e by my Pri&s;on. In order to &s;hew my &s;elf to that Prince&s;s, and to all her Court, I leaned out of the Window, as far as ever I could, and threw up my Morning Gown, which fell into Rags, and could not but excite the Curio&s;ity, of tho&s;e, who &s;aw it. I know not, whether the Empre&s;s perceived me, as &s;he was in her Coach, but all her Attendants ca&s;t their Eyes on me, and viewed me very atten|tively.</P>
<P>This was the only Advantage I reaped from an Attempt, of which I had formed great Hopes. My Time I &s;pent, as u&s;ual, in eating and drinking, tho always very moderately; in walking up and down my Chamber, and &s;ometimes in reflecting &s;eriou&s;ly on my Condition. I was, at the &s;ame Time, ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="125" REF="358">
to fre&s;h Trials, in which I &s;tood in Need of all that Moderation which you have been frequently plea&s;ed to call Stupidity. As the Regiments of <HI>A|&s;tracan</HI> and <HI>Ingria</HI> were on their March, and only her Maje&s;ty's Body-Guards remained in the City, they were obliged to &s;end &s;ome Pea&s;ants to my Pri|&s;on, who were lately &s;ent for from their Villages, and who&s;e ru&s;tick Deportment was highly di&s;agree|able to me. My Philo&s;ophy was, on many Occa&s;i|ons, of little or no Service, and I was obliged &s;ome|times to come to Blows, to keep them within Bounds. The Soldiers, who were my Guard be|fore, and who were obliged to follow their Regi|ments, were much more tractable, and civilized; but the&s;e Pea&s;ants, were all barefaced Ra&s;cals, ripe for any Villany. Hence you may form an Idea of a great Part of the Re&s;t of the Nation. I have, however, ob&s;erved &s;ome Di&s;parity among the Peo|ple of this va&s;t Empire. The Inhabitants of <HI>Mu&s;|cow,</HI> and tho&s;e who live within fifty Leagues of that City, are the mo&s;t un&s;ociable of Human Kind, and hardly de&s;erve the Name of Men. As I removed from that Part of the Country, I found by Degrees the People le&s;s Ru&s;tick, more Humane, and con&s;e|quently more fit to be ranked among Men, than the Inhabitants of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> and the adjacent Places. The lea&s;t barbarous of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> are tho&s;e who live in the mo&s;t remote Fore&s;ts, and are, in their Actions, guided by the mere In&s;tinct of Nature.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Inconveniencies I laboured under on Account of my new Guard, I was, at the &s;ame Time, deprived of the kind Vi&s;its of Mr. <HI>De L'I&s;le</HI>'s Servant, who was taken with a fit of Sickne&s;s, which confined him at home. This Accident hindered me a long Time, from hearing any other News, but what my Guard and my Stewards were plea&s;ed to impart to me. Nothing afforded me greater Com|fort, in &s;o doleful a Situation, than the Liberty I
<PB N="126" REF="359">
had of looking out at my Window, where I could view the fine&s;t Part of the City. On one Side of my Pri&s;on, I had the Pro&s;pect of a large Garden and Palace, which formerly belonged to the unfor|tunate Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> and which, at pre&s;ent, &s;erves as an Academy for the Cadets. I had every Day the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing tho&s;e young Per&s;ons per|form their Exerci&s;es; but have been &s;ince informed, that the State entirely neglects to give them an Edu|cation becoming them; and hence the Advantage, expected from that E&s;tabli&s;hment, is fru&s;trated. The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are gro&s;ly mi&s;taken, when they imagine, that the only Qualification requi&s;ite to make a good Soldier, and a Great Captain, is the Art of per|forming the Exerci&s;es, and knowing all the Moti|ons of military Di&s;cipline. All tho&s;e, who are ar|rived to any Perfection in the military Art, have had Recour&s;e to other Sources, and learned Rudi|ments, very different from tho&s;e taught in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> The Prime Mini&s;ters have never &s;ufficiently weighed one Point, which is, that they have always been too ha&s;ty, and endeavoured to run before they could creep, in all their new E&s;tabli&s;hments, and hence it is, that they have frequently neglected the mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential Matters. In&s;tead of founding an Academy of Sciences, and educating a Body of Cadets, they ought to have e&s;tabli&s;hed Colleges and Schools, there to have taught the grand Principles of Religi|on and Morality. There they &s;hould have begun the Reform they propo&s;ed; and, indeed, if due Care is not taken in the Education of Youth, how can the Nation po&s;&s;ibly be extricated from that Bar|barity, in which it has been, for &s;o many Ages, invol|ved? But I &s;hall wave the&s;e Reflections, which are a little too &s;erious, and perhaps not very pertinent.</P>
<P>Such were the Objects, that pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my View in one of the Chambers of my Pri&s;on, I come now to the other, from which I de&s;cried the
<PB N="127" REF="360">
Admiralty, and another very large Edifice, intend|ed for Her Imperial Maje&s;ty's Palace, not fini&s;h|ed, but carrying on with great A&s;&s;iduity. I recei|ved the more Plea&s;ure from the Pro&s;pect of the&s;e Buildings, as I daily &s;aw Crowds of People there, and continual Changes in the Decorations. Though &s;o many different Objects diverted me for a Time, yet I could not but make &s;erious Reflections on the Cau&s;es of what I every Day beheld, and was mo&s;t &s;truck with. I was in the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation at &s;eeing the Admiralty, when I begun to con&s;ider, how a Nation, like the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian,</HI> could equip and maintain &s;o numerous a Fleet. A &s;ingle Man, &s;aid I, to my &s;elf, may perform Wonders, when his Genius is &s;uch, as to qualify him for every underta|king, and he enjoys, at the &s;ame Time, a &s;overeign Authority. Such was <HI>Peter</HI> the Great, who, not|with&s;tanding the in&s;uperable Difficulties, which he could not but fore&s;ee, and actually met with, was never di&s;couraged, but continued to pur&s;ue his Aim, even to the la&s;t Moment of his Life. His Succe&s;|&s;ors have endeavoured to Walk in his Steps, but with little Succe&s;s. The Aver&s;ion, all <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> in general bear to the Sea, has always been, and ever will be, one of the greate&s;t Ob&s;tacles to the Accompli&s;hment of &s;o great a Work. Tho&s;e a|mong them, who have Employments in the Navy, lament their Fate, and look upon them&s;elves as mi&s;erable Slaves, condemned to the Gallies. I leave you to judge, whether the maritime Forces of this State can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t long? I may perhaps be mi&s;taken, but I am per&s;uaded their Navy will fall away to nothing. It was, &s;ome Time &s;ince, on a Footing very different from what it is now. All tho&s;e fine Edifices, which by that <HI>Czar</HI>'s Order, were built at <HI>Cron&s;tadt,</HI> have, by an unpardonable Neglect, already been &s;uffered to dilapidate, and this I my &s;elf have, with &s;ome Indignation, been an
<PB N="128" REF="361">
Eye-Witne&s;s of. You will, moreover, upon an Examination of the Plan, that great Prince formed for the Building of <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> find only Part of it duly executed. He propo&s;ed, in order to accu&s;tom his Subjects to Water, to open a large Number of Ca|nals through the City, and this very thing has, in &s;everal Places, been neglected. That glorious Em|peror would, during his Life, never permit any Bridge to be laid a-cro&s;s the River, or his Subjects to make u&s;e of Oars in pa&s;&s;ing over. By this, they were laid under a Nece&s;&s;ity of learning how to ma|nage a Sail, if they wanted to go from one Part of the City to the other. The&s;e Regulations are now entirely aboli&s;hed. The Admiralty I have not &s;een, but if I may give Credit to the Per&s;ons employed there, every Thing is in a terrible Di&s;order. A Report is however current in the Publick News, that they levied &s;everal thou&s;and Seamen for this Campaign. The <HI>Baltick</HI> is not very large, and we &s;hall con&s;equently &s;oon know, how they are to be employed. I &s;hall, therefore, give Credit to all that is &s;aid about them, till we are better informed.</P>
<P>As for another Fleet, which is &s;aid to be intended for the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, I much doubt of the Truth of that Report, &s;ince there is not yet a &s;ingle Ve&s;&s;el on that Sea. I know, that this Project was formed by <HI>Peter</HI> I. and have my &s;elf &s;een five or &s;ix Ships at <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> of a particular Structure, de&s;igned for tho&s;e Seas, but they are left on the Stocks, and there pro|bably they will &s;till remain. Be&s;ides, the Seamen which were to be employed on that Occa&s;ion, were recalled to <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> towards the Conclu&s;ion of 1733, and &s;et out on their Journey at the &s;ame Time I did. Be therefore a&s;&s;ured, Sir, that if there are, at pre&s;ent, any Ve&s;&s;els on the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, they are at be&s;t, only &s;ome large Barks, built after the Man|ner of the Country, and made u&s;e of for the Traf|fick of private Per&s;ons. To this I may add, that
<PB N="129" REF="362">
tho&s;e Barks are &s;o far from being fit to keep the Sea, that I have &s;trong Rea&s;ons to doubt, whether any one of them ever &s;ailed to <HI>A&s;tracan.</HI> Their Structure is very uncommon, and I believe it will be &s;omewhat new to you, if I tell you, that the Carriages in tho&s;e Parts have two Poles, and the Barks two Helms. But this does not facilitate their Motion, which I my &s;elf have but too much ex|perienced.</P>
<P>This may give you an Idea of the Fleet on the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. A flouri&s;hing Commerce might, I grant, be e&s;tabli&s;hed there: But, to bring about an Enterprize like that, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> mu&s;t be le&s;s &s;tu|pid, and the Mini&s;try of that great Monarchy made up of abler Per&s;ons. But nothing &s;eems more &s;ur|prizing, than that, as they are them&s;elves incapable of carrying on &s;uch a Commerce, they will not per|mit Foreigners to do it. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> it is well known, have made &s;everal Attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h a Trade in this Country, but, notwith|&s;tanding the con&s;iderable Advantages the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI> might have gained thereby, tho&s;e Endeavours have all been fruitle&s;s. Be not, therefore, deluded, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have no &s;uch Fleet in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> the Rumour is groundle&s;s, and only publi&s;hed with a View of impo&s;ing upon the World. But if they actually had &s;uch a Fleet, I know not the lea&s;t Benefit they could receive from it. It cannot be &s;aid to be intended for Commerce, &s;ince their Trade con&s;i&s;ts only in Salt Fi&s;h, which is vended at <HI>A&s;tra|can.</HI> Nor have we more Rea&s;on to believe, that they propo&s;e to make U&s;e of it, in defending, in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, the Conque&s;ts they have made in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as they can neither land on the Coa&s;ts of the Province of <HI>Kilan,</HI> nor on a great Part of tho&s;e of <HI>Schirvan.</HI> The Water is too &s;hallow on the former, and the Ground of the latter is by no Means fit for any Ship to Anchor in. It would be more
<PB N="130" REF="363">
advi&s;able for the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> to keep a good Army on Foot, in tho&s;e Parts, than to have a Fleet there; for, unle&s;s they re&s;tore that Country voluntarily, it is to be pre&s;umed, that the former Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors will not fail to &s;urprize them, and force them to return what they have made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of, con|trary to the Laws of Nations.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you, that there is, on the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, a Kind of &s;mall Fleet mann'd by the Subjects of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Empire, I mean tho&s;e bold and re&s;olute Pirates, the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> of <HI>Jaick,</HI> who, during the Summer Sea&s;on, cruize, with a large Number of Barks; on the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;ts of that Sea. They pillage and ran&s;ack whatever they meet with; and as the Spoils the&s;e People make are their only Support, they know neither Friend nor Ally, where their Interest is concerned; nay, it frequently happens, that they have no Regard for the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> who fall into their Hands. Per|haps it is to the&s;e Barks the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have given the Appellation of a Fleet, and in that Ca&s;e I can|not but agree with them, that they have one: I &s;hould only de&s;ire them to explain their Meaning more clearly, when they publi&s;h News of that Kind, and not endeavour to impo&s;e on the Publick.</P>
<P>I did not intend, Sir, to detain you with &s;o long Digre&s;&s;ions, and &s;hould be at a Lo&s;s to ac|count for my being thus tedious. Are not all the&s;e beautiful Objects, which my Chamber-Windows pre&s;ent to my View, the Occa&s;ion of it? But the Enquiry is hardly worth the Labour, and be&s;ides,

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Should be glad to know, what you think of my long Silence. You have undoubtedly &s;uppo&s;ed me once more lo&s;t, or at lea&s;t, that I have met with &s;ome fre&s;h Adventure. But be not unea&s;y, Sir, neither of the&s;e is the Ca&s;e. You need only re|collect the deplorable State I have been reduc'd to, and then you'll not find it difficult to gue&s;s at the Cau&s;e. Whoever, like me, has had the Misfor|tune to &s;wallow a large Do&s;e of Poi&s;on, cannot ex|pect but to lead afterwards a lingring Life. I &s;till continue weak, and am hardly able to apply my &s;elf to any Thing. I was &s;ome Days ago &s;eiz'd with &s;o great a Heavine&s;s, that I thought I had lo&s;t the U&s;e of all my Limbs. My Mind &s;eemed on that Occa&s;ion to receive Impre&s;&s;ions from my Body, and appeared as it were annihilated. I can|not, I a&s;&s;ure you, conceive the Cau&s;e of the&s;e Symptoms, and very much doubt, whether the mo&s;t able Phy&s;icians can account for them. But mo&s;t certain it is, that they mu&s;t have been pro|duced by &s;ome &s;ubtle Poi&s;on, known only to the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> But why do I tire you with this &s;hock|ing Subject. Let us mention it no more. For I ought perhaps to think my &s;elf happy in feeling the Effects of it.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t, I informed you, how I diverted my &s;elf in my Pri&s;on. I &s;pent my Time there, as I
<PB N="132" REF="365">
told you before, &s;ometimes in making &s;erious Re|flections on the State of my Affairs, and &s;ometimes in con&s;idering on Means, whereby to deliver my &s;elf from my Captivity. I was at a Lo&s;s what Cour&s;e to take, and knew not what to rely on, when I received Orders to prepare to appear before the Senate. This agreeable News I received on the 18th of <HI>June.</HI> Be plea&s;ed, Sir, to take No|tice of this Epoch, which, as I believe I have ob|&s;erved before, is very remarkable. Having been conducted to the Senate-Chamber, I there &s;aw an A&s;&s;embly of &s;even or eight Lords, all &s;itting round a Table, and &s;eeming to expect me with &s;ome Im|patience. I was &s;o far from being intimidated at the Sight of the&s;e Gentlemen, that it encouraged me to approach them without being dejected, or ex|pre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion. They gave me a very cold Reception, in a Manner &s;eemingly per|plexed. They hardly dared to lift up their Eyes. After a Moment's Silence, one of them, who had formerly been condemn'd to the Scaffold, to leave his Head in the Hands of the Executioner, was the fir&s;t, who &s;poke, and acco&s;ting me, told me in <HI>Italian,</HI> that, as they were informed, that I de|manded a Hearing, they had &s;ent for me, to know what I had to alledge in my own Behalf. I an|&s;wered, that as I &s;aw no End of my Impri&s;onment, nor could conceive the Motives of &s;o tedious and in&s;upportable a Captivity, I had re&s;olved, three Months before, to pre&s;ent a Petition, whereby I de&s;ired to be heard what I had to &s;ay in my Ju&s;|tification. That I now re-iterated the &s;ame De|mand, and that the Ju&s;tice of my Cau&s;e, and the Equity of the A&s;&s;embly, removed all Doubts of not obtaining an immediate and entire Satisfaction. But replied he, what is your De&s;ign, what is it you intend to write? Nothing, an&s;wered I, but what is nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify my Proceedings and
<PB N="133" REF="366">
Conduct. Could you not, &s;aid he, do this by Word of Mouth, and what induces you to de&s;ire, to do it in Writing? I told him, I was at that In|&s;tant ready to vindicate my &s;elf, if they thought fit: But that I believed, I could repre&s;ent Things to them in a clearer Light, in Writing, and that they might then make their Report of it to the <HI>Czarina,</HI> from whom I had Rea&s;on to expect im|mediate Redre&s;s. This they were obliged to put to the Vote, and to con&s;ult among them&s;elves, what would be mo&s;t proper in this Ca&s;e. After having made me wait a long Time, they told me at la&s;t, I &s;hould have Nece&s;&s;aries for Writing, and that, the next Morning, they would receive my Plea. I returned them Thanks, and promi&s;ed to begin it immediately, and be ready for the ap|pointed Hour. Being a&s;ked by one of tho&s;e Gen|tlemen, whether I under&s;tood no other Language but the <HI>Italian,</HI> I an&s;wered that I was likewi&s;e ver&s;ed in the <HI>French;</HI> whereupon he de&s;ired, I would likewi&s;e draw up a Copy of my Repre&s;entation in that Tongue.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was I returned to my Pri&s;on, than I was &s;upplied with all Things requi&s;ite for writ|ting, and in&s;tantly begun to draw up my two Co|pies. As I had not much Time to &s;pare for the Completion of this Work, I was obliged to be ex|peditious, and the Length, together with the Stile of it, may give you Room to judge how great a Hurry I was in. No one appeared the next Morn|ing to fetch my Paper, nor was it &s;ent for, till the Day following. Such are the Proceedings of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> they act in every Thing with an unheard of Slowne&s;s, and I thought my &s;elf well off, to find, that it was not po&s;tponed for &s;everal Weeks.</P>
<P>I beg leave here to tran&s;cribe this Writing entire, and to &s;end it you very near the &s;ame, as it was
<PB N="134" REF="367">
pre&s;ented to the Senate, though you have, in my preceding Letters, already &s;een a Part of what was contained therein. I &s;hall be glad in the Sequel to know your Opinion of it, and whether the Rea|&s;ons I there alledge were not &s;ufficient for my Ju&s;ti|fication.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"I &s;et out from <HI>France,</HI> about the Beginning of the Year 1733, <HI>&s;ic jubente fata.</HI> All <HI>Europe</HI> was then in a profound Peace. The principal Motive of my Departure from that Country was, to avoid a Marriage, which I &s;hould have been inevitably obliged to. I travelled through <HI>Germany,</HI> without being provided with any Pa&s;s, or being ever a&s;ked for one in any Place what|&s;oever. Being arrived at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> I was forced to make &s;ome Stay there, till I could meet with the Convenience of a Ship, to carry me to <HI>Pe|ter&s;burg,</HI> whither I intended to go. I lodged at the Hou&s;e of an <HI>Italian,</HI> named <HI>Brunati,</HI> who then lived at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and continued there dur|ing my Stay in that City. As I propo&s;ed to be there <HI>incognito:</HI> I pretended to be an <HI>Italian</HI> Merchant, and went by the Name of <HI>Roccaforte.</HI> When I was ju&s;t going to leave that Place, I was told, that I mu&s;t provide my &s;elf with a Pa&s;s, and that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as I de|&s;igned for <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI> I applied hereupon to the Magi&s;tracy of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and to the Per&s;on who is entru&s;ted with the Direction of the Affairs of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> in that City."</P><P>"Thus provided with two Pa&s;&s;es, I departed from <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> about the Middle of <HI>June.</HI> My Landlord recommend|ed me, by Letter, to the Acquaintance of Mr.
<PB N="135" REF="368">
<HI>Mariotti.</HI> To this Gentleman I freely opened my Mind, and acquainted him with my Re&s;olu|tion of entring into military Service. I told him, that I was not a Merchant, but a Soldier, and a Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction. As I was determined not to di&s;cover my real Name, I took Care to pa&s;s by no other, but that of <HI>Roccaforte.</HI> Mr. <HI>Ma|riotti</HI> apprized me of the great Difficulties I &s;hould meet with in the Execution of my De&s;ign, but when I told him, that Mr. <HI>Avolio</HI> had offered me his Service, he promi&s;ed to &s;end for him to his Hou&s;e, and to treat with him on that Head. We met all three at the appointed Hour, and tho&s;e Gentlemen being both of the &s;ame Opinion, I was obliged to think of &s;ome other Expedient."</P> <P>"I was &s;oon fixed in my Choice, and determi|ned to go in Que&s;t of Employment into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> I had been informed, that the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e-Hom|burg,</HI> commanded there, and, as I was not ig|norant of his many excellent Qualities, I had Room to think, that he would grant me his Pro|tection. This Re&s;olution was confirmed by a &s;ingular Adventure, which at the &s;ame Time cau&s;ed me to ha&s;ten my Departure. As her Ma|je&s;ty was one Day returning from a Review, which had been taken on the Meadow, on the &s;ide of her Summer-Palace, I was walking along the little Canal, which &s;eparates the Meadow from the Garden, and there I &s;at down, with a Book in my Hand, at the Root of a Tree. Whil&s;t my Mind was wholly intent on what I read, Her Maje&s;ty, accompanied by only three or four Per&s;ons, came into a Walk of the Garden, di|rectly opo&s;ite to the Place where I &s;at, without my perceiving her. One of that Prince&s;s's Reti|nue came at the &s;ame Time to the Banks of the Canal, and made Signs to me to ri&s;e, telling me, that Her Maje&s;ty was there. I immediately
<PB N="136" REF="369">
obeyed, and after having made a very low Bow, I retired &s;ome Steps backwards, with a De&s;ign to depart. The &s;ame Per&s;on, who had &s;poken to me, returned, in the very In&s;tant, and a&s;ked me, by her Maje&s;ty's Command, whether I was an <HI>Italian?</HI> I an&s;wered, <HI>Son Italiano</HI> (I am an <HI>Italian</HI>) and in&s;tantly retired. I was greatly a|mazed, not being able to comprehend, how the <HI>Czarina</HI> could take me for an <HI>Italian.</HI> Had not the Canal hindered me from approaching that Prince&s;s, I &s;hould perhaps have taken Advan|tage of &s;o lucky an Incident, and have thrown my &s;elf at her Feet, to beg &s;ome Employment of her, &s;ince I was in &s;o great an Uncertainty of obtaining any el&s;ewhere."</P>
<P>"I went, after this Adventure, to Mr. <HI>Mariotti,</HI> and begged of him to procure me an Opportuni|ty of departing &s;peedily, I &s;old, in the mean Time, Part of my Equipage, to have where|withal to bear my Charges. As I had Occa&s;ion for a fre&s;h Pa&s;s, I went my &s;elf to the College of Commerce, to a&s;k for one, which they granted me by the &s;ame Name of <HI>Roccaforte.</HI> Whil&s;t I was employed in making Provi&s;ions for my Journey, I was informed, that &s;ome Profe&s;&s;ors of the Academy were preparing for an immediate Journey to <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> from whence they were to go to <HI>Kamtschatki.</HI> This Opportunity was too favou|rable to be neglected; I therefore made Enquiry directly, to whom I mu&s;t apply my &s;elf, to be admitted into their Company. I was recom|mended to Mr. <HI>De l'I&s;le,</HI> whom I thereupon vi&s;ited. This learned Profe&s;&s;or gave me a very kind Reception. He told me, he was not to go the Journey him&s;elf, but that his Brother was. Having applied to him, he approved of my Re&s;olution, and promi&s;ed me all the Service in his Power. The two other Profe&s;&s;ors received
<PB N="137" REF="370">
me with equal Civility. Having got every thing ready for my Journey, Mr. <HI>Dela Croyere</HI> &s;ent me a Me&s;&s;age, to come to his Hou&s;e, with all my Baggage, in Order to depart the next Day. Our Journey was, neverthele&s;s, delay'd, and Mr. <HI>De l'I&s;le</HI> and his Wife took me, in the mean Time, in the mo&s;t obliging Manner imaginable, into their Hou&s;e. I di&s;covered to Mr. <HI>De l'I&s;le,</HI> in the Conver&s;ation I had with him, my earne&s;t De&s;ire of undertaking the Journey to <HI>Kamts|chatki,</HI> but being informed, that I mu&s;t apply to the Senate for that Purpo&s;e, I thought no more of it. It would have been impo&s;&s;ible to remain unknown, as I de&s;ired to be, if I had applied to the Senate. Some other Difficulties occurring, with Regard to my Journey with the Profe&s;&s;ors, I re&s;olved to &s;et out before them, with only one Servant, whom <HI>Mon&s;. de la Croyere</HI> had been &s;o kind as to give me."</P>
<P>"I met the&s;e Gentlemen at <HI>Bronnits,</HI> from whence I continued my Journey with them to <HI>Ca&s;an.</HI> At my Arrival, I immediately made Enquiry whe|ther any Ship was ready to fail for <HI>A&s;tracan.</HI> The Sea&s;on being too far already advanced, my En|quiries were in vain. In this Juncture, I thought of another Expedient, and having met with a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, which &s;eemed to be convenient, I had re&s;olved to embark in it. The imminent Dan|ger, I was going to expo&s;e my &s;elf to, was &s;o plainly repre&s;ented to me, by tho&s;e, to whom I communicated my De&s;ign, that they, at la&s;t, prevailed upon me to alter my Mind. After having well weighed the Matter, I thought it more convenient to take the Journey by Land, and to wait &s;ome Time longer. As I had heard a very good Character of the Governour of <HI>Ca|&s;an,</HI> I thought it my Duty to pay my Re&s;pects to him. When I acco&s;ted him, I gave him my
<PB N="138" REF="371">
Pa&s;s, and, acquainting him with my real Quali|ty, I told him, that I was nothing le&s;s than a Merchant, and that I thought it a Matter of lit|tle Importance to the Publick to know my real Name and Condition, that I was determined to repair to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and to offer my &s;elf to the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e Homburg,</HI> to &s;erve under him, in Her Maje&s;ty's Troops. He bemoaned my Fate, and, at the &s;ame Time, promi&s;ed to procure me the fir&s;t Opportunity for my Departure. He de&s;ired to know my Name, and took it down in Writing. Having a&s;ked his Leave to vi&s;it him now and then, he replied, he &s;hould look upon it as an Honour; and a&s;&s;ured me I might rely on his Protection."</P>
<P>"Having taken this Step, I went to <HI>Mon&s;. de la Croyere,</HI> re&s;olved to acquaint him with what had pa&s;&s;ed. But, I was hardly got into his Apart|ment, when the Major of the Place came to arre&s;t me, by the Governor's Order, and &s;eized my Sword. Nothing was found about me, or in my Trunk, which could give any Grounds for Su&s;pi|cion. In &s;hort, after three Days, I was carried to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Peter&s;burg.</HI> All the&s;e Circum&s;tances being well averred, and there being none of them which can admit of the lea&s;t Doubt, the next Enquiry is, whether there was any Room to &s;uppo&s;e me a Criminal, or that I had any other Intention, than that of being employed in Her Maje&s;ty's Service. This En|quiry may be made in the following Manner, which will, at the &s;ame Time, give &s;ufficient Proofs for my Ju&s;tification."</P>
<P>"I ob&s;erved above, that I quitted <HI>France,</HI> at the Beginning of the Year 1733, at a Time, when all <HI>Europe</HI> was in Peace. This fir&s;t Re|mark is an inconte&s;table Proof, that I could not be charged with any &s;ecret Commi&s;&s;ion from the
<PB N="139" REF="372">
Court of <HI>France,</HI> to the Prejudice of that of <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ia.</HI> But &s;uppo&s;ing even, that I had not left <HI>France,</HI> till after the Face of Affairs was changed in <HI>Poland,</HI> by the Death of King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> can it be pre&s;umed, that I &s;hould be made Choice of, at &s;o important a Juncture? Ought I, not, on the other Hand, to have taken other Mea&s;ures, than tho&s;e, which it is evident I did take, and &s;hould I not have been more cautious, and re&s;erved in all my Proceedings? My Behaviour was certainly not like that of a Per&s;on, who endeavoured to impo&s;e upon others. How can any one, more|over, be &s;uppo&s;ed to be an Emi&s;&s;ary, who is not in the lea&s;t acquainted with the Language of that Country, to which he is &s;ent, and neither provi|ded with any Retinue, nor even with an Inter|preter? Per&s;ons, entru&s;ted with the Management of State-Affairs, are, I believe, &s;eldom &s;ent in|to a foreign Country, without being furni&s;hed with Money, or, at lea&s;t, Credit. But I came into <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> without either. This la&s;t is a mo&s;t convincing Proof, and merits &s;ome Regard. But let us go yet farther, and examine all my Steps."</P>
<P>"The &s;ole Motive of my Departure from <HI>France,</HI> was to avoid a Marriage which I mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have engaged in. That I quitted upon no other, but &s;ome &s;uch Inducement, is &s;ufficiently proved by the Manner, wherein I retired from all the World, from my mo&s;t intimate Friends, and from my Dome&s;ticks, abandoning, at the &s;ame Time, all I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. I know not, whether a|ny Enquiries have been made after me, but if there has, there can have been no other An&s;wer, but that I di&s;appeared at the Beginning of 1733, and that none had &s;ince been able to get Infor|mation, whither I was retired, It is well known, what Reply I made to the Que&s;tion, which was put to me at Her Maje&s;ty's Palace, when I was
<PB N="140" REF="373">
ordered to name the Per&s;on, who was the Oc|ca&s;ion of my Flight. I told the Gentleman, who was &s;o inqui&s;itive on that Head, that the Sex claimed a particular Re&s;pect, though it often merited not our lea&s;t Regard. I here beg leave to add, that if a Declaration of that kind could even procure my Liberty, or &s;ave my Life, I &s;hould not con&s;ent to make it; and were I to be guilty of &s;o ba&s;e an Action, I &s;hould think my &s;elf de&s;erving of the mo&s;t rigorous Treatment from Her Maje&s;ty. But what, af|ter all, would a Confe&s;&s;ion of that Kind avail? It would be needle&s;s for me to name the Per&s;on my &s;elf, if the Affair is publickly known, as others may be applied to for that Intelligence. But if, on the contrary, this Adventure is not come to any one's Knowledge, if I am the on|ly Per&s;on acquainted with it, I think my &s;elf obliged in Honour and Con&s;cience to keep it &s;ecret. But &s;uppo&s;ing, I &s;hould name the La|dy, would my Confe&s;&s;ion be credited, or would &s;he her&s;elf be applied to, to relate the Corre&s;|pondence that had been between her and me? Should the Boldne&s;s or In&s;olence be carried &s;o far, I believe the Attempt&punc; would be fruitle&s;s, and turn to the Confu&s;ion of him who &s;hould make it."</P>
<P>"It &s;eems needle&s;s to make any Mention here of my Journey through <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;ince mo&s;t of the States, through which I pa&s;&s;ed, are her Ma|je&s;ty's Allies and Confederates. I &s;hall only take Notice of my Stay at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> where I was known to the Gentleman who there admini&s;ters the Affairs of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI> I led a very retired Life, in that City, and conver&s;ed, to the be&s;t of my Knowledge, with no other Per&s;on, there, but tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e, where I lodged. I went a few Days after my Arrival, to pay a Vi&s;it to
<PB N="141" REF="374">
Her Maje&s;ty's Re&s;ident in that City, I even had frequent Opportunities of &s;eeing him, afterwards, and from him I received a Pa&s;s at my Depar|ture. If all the&s;e Proceedings be con&s;idered, can it be inferred from hence, that I was, at that Time, charged with any &s;ecret or dange|rous Commi&s;&s;ion?"</P>
<P>"Let my Behaviour at <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> be next ex|amined. I repaired, on my Arrival into that Capital, to Mr. <HI>Mariotti,</HI> to deliver a Letter, which had been given me, and begged at the &s;ame Time, he would procure me a Lodging near his Hou&s;e; I then, according to the Cu&s;|tom of the Country, carried my Pa&s;s to the Ma|gi&s;tracy, before I went to my Lodging; when I went from thence to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e to take out my Baggage, I met with <HI>Mon&s;. Avo|lio,</HI> who o&s;&s;ered me his Service. As that Gen|tleman was not acquainted with me, he imme|diately enquired, what Profe&s;&s;ion I was of, and whether I was not come to <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> with a View of following that of a Fencing-Ma&s;ter. I an&s;wered, &s;miling, that I knew how to u&s;e my Sword, in my own Defence, but was not a Per&s;on who would in&s;truct others in that Art. He then, in very obliging Terms, repeated his Of|fers of Service, but I told him, that I could not accept of them yet, but &s;hould, in the Se|quel, be glad of the Honour of a longer Con|ver&s;ation with him. Let any one judge, by the&s;e Circum&s;tances, whether I endeavoured, at that Time, to be concealed, as was, without Grounds, intimated in the Examination I pa&s;&s;ed in Her Maje&s;ty's Palace. But let us view what fol|lowed. I took Mr. <HI>Mariotti</HI> a&s;ide, the next Morning, and fully entru&s;ted him with the Si|tuation of my Affairs. The only Secret I was unwilling to di&s;clo&s;e to him, was, my real Name.
<PB N="142" REF="375">
As I was determined to enter into Her Maje&s;ty's Service, I took his Advice, how to proceed in that Ca&s;e. When he endeavoured to repre&s;ent the great Difficulties I &s;hould meet with in my De&s;ign; I told him, that <HI>Mon&s;. Avolio</HI> had of|fered me his Service, and that I doubted not, but he would act in my Behalf; in &s;hort, in the Con|ference I had with the&s;e two Gentlemen, they a|greed in their Opinions, that my Project could not &s;ucceed. Hereupon I re&s;olved to go into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and de&s;ire no other Favour of them, but that of recommending me to their Friends. Is any one of the&s;e Circum&s;tances capable of ground|ing a Su&s;picion of my being an Emi&s;&s;ary?"</P>
<P>"During my Stay at <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> I own that I pa&s;&s;ed by a fictitious Name, but did not, how|ever, conceal my &s;elf from any one, and every Body there might judge of every Step I took. I frequented the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Mariotti,</HI> with him I dieted, and conver&s;ed familiarly, with whom|&s;oever I there met with. I never failed being at the Catholick Church, and vi&s;iting the Fathers who officiated there, and this I did at Times when tho&s;e Places were frequented by a great Concour&s;e of People. I di&s;cour&s;ed indi&s;crimi|nately with every one, owned my &s;elf to be an <HI>Italian,</HI> and my being come from <HI>France</HI> was concealed from none. I walked through every Part of the City, was pre&s;ent at all Reviews, and a Spectator of all the Exerci&s;es performed by the Troops; I was, in fine, &s;o far from endeavour|ing to remain unknown, that I even expo&s;ed my &s;elf to the Eyes of the <HI>Czarina.</HI> All that can be inferred from the&s;e Things, is, that I concealed my Name, and, as I could not appear in a Manner &s;uitable to my Birth, kept within the Bounds, to which the Situation of my Affairs had reduced me."</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="376">
"When I &s;ought for an Opportunity of depart|ing from thence, I was informed that the Profe&s;|&s;ors were likewi&s;e preparing for a Journey; to the&s;e Gentlemen I made pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances, to ad|mit me into their Company, which they granted. I &s;hould, without Doubt, have carefully avoided being one of that Party, had I intended to re|main unknown. Satisfied with what I thought I had obtained, I retired to the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>De l'I&s;le,</HI> in Expectation of my Departure; here I &s;aw every one who came thither, conver&s;ed with them, and, as our chief Di&s;cour&s;e generally con|cerned <HI>France,</HI> they might ea&s;ily gue&s;s, by what I &s;aid on that Subject my &s;elf, that I was tho|roughly acquainted with the <HI>French</HI> Court, and had &s;pent great Part of my Life in that Country. My Con&s;ultation with Mr. <HI>De l'I&s;le,</HI> about the Journey to <HI>Kamt&s;chatki</HI> was by no Means feigned, and I was fully re&s;olved to undertake it, my only Aim, at that Time, being to retire into a Coun|try where I might live unknown to every one. Would a Per&s;on charged with any Commi&s;&s;ion have acted a Part like this? I am plainly ju&s;tifi|ed by the bare Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Facts."</P>
<P>"But to this it is objected, that taking Pa&s;&s;es in a fictitious Name manife&s;tly proves my Guilt. By a Regulation e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout the whole Kingdom, I could not obtain a fre&s;h Pa&s;s, with|out producing, at the &s;ame Time, that which I had brought from <HI>Dantzick.</HI> Since therefore I was unwilling to be known by my real Name, I was obliged to continue to pa&s;s for a Merchant, and to retain the Name of <HI>Rocceforte.</HI> This Ac|cu&s;ation is certainly without Foundation, and thus I reply to it."</P>
<P>"I could not, in the Situation I was in, and being &s;o de&s;irous of executing the Re&s;olution I had ta|ken of entring into the Service, avoid a Di&s;cove|ry
<PB N="144" REF="377">
of my real Quality, and was obliged to profe&s;s my &s;elf a Soldier, and to quit my Cha|racter of a Merchant. Privileges of this Kind have been always allowed to Travellers, the Law of Nations no ways oppo&s;e it, there is no Law that forbids it, it is authorized by the Cu&s;tom of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and in &s;hort Princes &s;ome|times afford us Precedents of what I have done. Unle&s;s a Traveller applies his Pa&s;s to a bad Purpo&s;e, he has never been thought criminal for making u&s;e of a fictitious Name. Can it be proved, that I have made any Attempt to pre|judice the State? The publick Affairs are no ways concerned in the Change of my Name; that is my Affair only."</P>
<P>"But it may be again objected, what Occa&s;ion had I to take a Pa&s;s for <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> when I de|&s;igned to go el&s;e where? This Accu&s;ation is no better grounded, than the others; for, in the fir&s;t Place, when I required a Pa&s;s for <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> I intended to take that Route, and &s;hould actu|ally have done it, had not &s;ome new Difficul|ties, which I could not fore&s;ee, induced me to change my Re&s;olution. In the &s;econd Place, when I produced my Pa&s;s, I was told, that it would be needle&s;s to take any other, and that with this I &s;hould find an uninterrupted Pa&s;&s;age throughout <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI> and la&s;tly, as my fir&s;t Pa&s;s had co&s;t me five or &s;ix Rubles, and I was not very flu&s;h of Money, I thought I might di&s;|pen&s;e with purcha&s;ing, at &s;o dear a Rate, what I had no Occa&s;ion for."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall not enter into a Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of what pa&s;s'd on my Journey from <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> to <HI>Ca|&s;an.</HI> Whoever de&s;ires to know that, need on|ly peru&s;e my Journal on that Head, which may be found among&s;t my Papers. There may be &s;een an Account of the mo&s;t remarkable Ad|ventures
<PB N="145" REF="378">
I met with on that Journey, none of which can give any one Room to think me a &s;u&s;pected Per&s;on."</P>
<P>"Before I conclude this State of my Ca&s;e, it will be proper to make &s;ome Enquiry into my Conduct at <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> and this Article likewi&s;e merits &s;ome Con&s;ideration. No &s;ooner was I ar|rived in this City, than my Friends repre&s;ented to me a thou&s;and Difficulties, which attended the Voyage I was going to undertake; they re|mon&s;trated the bad Sea&s;on of the Year, the Dan|gers I was going to expo&s;e my &s;elf to, the Want of convenient Boats, and at la&s;t prevailed upon me to make a much longer Stay in that City, than I had propo&s;ed. Not thinking it, in the mean Time, proper to pa&s;s for an unknown Per&s;on, I went to vi&s;it the Governor, and opened my Mind to him. I frankly told him who I was, repre&s;ented to him the Situation of my Af|fairs, acquainted him with my De&s;igns, begged he would grant me &s;ome Per&s;ons to &s;erve for Guides, and, that he might have no Room to doubt of my Sincerity, offered him my Sword, and told him, that I was ready to be his Pri&s;oner, till he could be better informed of my Quality."</P>
<P>"This would certainly have been the mo&s;t im|prudent Step I ever made, had I intended to engage in any Undertaking contrary to the In|tere&s;ts of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI> I was be&s;ides under no Obli|gation of going to pay my Re&s;pects to the Go|vernor. I might even have been at <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> before that Time, by only hiring a &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;el in any of the Cities I pa&s;&s;ed through, which would have carried me thither much &s;ooner, than by the Way of <HI>Ca&s;an;</HI> where I was oblig'd to make a long Stay. Nothing hinder'd me, moreover, from &s;etting Sail immediately after my Arrival at <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> &s;ince I met with a
<PB N="146" REF="379">
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, and many People offered me their Service to conduct me either by Land or Wa|ter. But in&s;tead of laying hold of the&s;e Con|veniences, I unfortunately went to vi&s;it the Go|vernor, who in&s;tantly cau&s;ed me to be Arre&s;ted, and afterwards to be ca&s;t into Pri&s;on. Such was my Adventure at <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> and it was that occa|&s;ioned my Detention."</P>
<P>"The la&s;t Thing I have to &s;ay in Vindication of my &s;elf is, that had I known my &s;elf guilty of any Crime, I could many ways have avoided being carried from <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> to <HI>Peter&s;burg;</HI> no|thing could have been more ea&s;y. For I may venture to &s;ay, without injuring my Guard, that they were willing to allow me a rea&s;onable Li|berty, and placed an entire Confidence in the Promi&s;e I had given them, not to endeavour making my E&s;cape. I regarded them rather as my Servants, than as my Guard. Their Arms and my Sword were always in my Sled, and in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, I could have made U&s;e of them. I was entirely at Liberty in the Night|time, which my Attendants always &s;pent in a profound Sleep. I might ea&s;ily have taken my Flight, whil&s;t I was among the <HI>Scheremi&s;s-Tartars,</HI> and have retired to a Place of Safety. Be&s;ides, had I been willing to offer Violence, Courage would not have been wanting, I might have ea&s;ily routed my three Soldiers. As for tho&s;e, who conducted me from <HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> to <HI>Pe|ter&s;burg,</HI> they hardly de&s;erve to be mentioned. Let it &s;uffice for their Character, that they were Drunkards, and notorious Thieves, who robbed me of whatever they could. As they were nei|ther cloathed nor armed, nor behaved, in any other Re&s;pect, like Soldiers, I know not whe|ther I may properly regard them as &s;uch. If I was guarded by the&s;e Scoundrels on my Jour|ney
<PB N="147" REF="380">
to <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> it mu&s;t be imputed to my own Willingne&s;s, as they were undoubtedly in|capable of keeping me Pri&s;oner."</P>
<P>"The Ju&s;tice of my Cau&s;e is &s;o plainly de|mon&s;trated by the&s;e &s;everal Facts, that I doubt not of obtaining my Liberty &s;o &s;oon as they are &s;ubmitted to Her Maje&s;ty's Judgment. The Piety, Ju&s;tice and Clemency of that Prince&s;s is &s;o well known to me, though a Stranger, that I am a&s;&s;ured, &s;he will never &s;uffer a rigorous Impri&s;onment to be inflicted on a Per&s;on, who came into her Dominions with no other De&s;ign, than that of devoting the remaining Part of his Life to her Service. Mo&s;t certain it is, that &s;ince the fir&s;t Minute of my Captivity, I have been treated with as much Severity as if I had acted openly to the Prejudice of the State."</P></Q></P>
<P>This, Sir, is the Hi&s;tory of my Captivity; I leave you to judge, upon this Account, of the Ju&s;tice of my Cau&s;e. Declare your Opinion &s;incerely, and tell me without Ceremony, whether you think me guilty? Ought I, do you think, to be detained in Pri&s;on, to be &s;ent into <HI>Siberia,</HI> or to be re&s;tor'd to my Liberty. I am &s;o well a&s;&s;ured of your Judg|ment and Equity, and of the Evidence of the Rea|&s;ons I here alledge, that I doubt not of your decid|ing the Matter in&s;tantly in my Behalf. I &s;hall tell you in the Sequel the Event of this Memorial.</P>
<P>As I expected &s;oon to know my Fate, after I had delivered this Writing, my Thoughts, in my Pri&s;on, were wholly employed upon procuring &s;ome &s;afe Retreat, where I might pa&s;s my Time agreeably. Retirement and Ea&s;e were now the only Objects of my Wi&s;hes. I was in the mean Time greatly perplexed in making Choice of a Place for my future Abode. <HI>France,</HI> the fine&s;t Coun|try in the Univer&s;e, repre&s;ented it&s;elf to me with mo&s;t attracting Charms, but the Adventure, which
<PB N="148" REF="381">
cau&s;ed my Departure from that plea&s;ant Abode, &s;uffered me not to &s;atisfy my Inclination. All, I could hope for, was, to live there unknown in &s;ome retired Place, till &s;ome fortunate Event could give another Turn to the State of my Affairs. I &s;hould have formed a Project very different, had I been in a better State of Health. As I was not far di&s;tant from <HI>Poland,</HI> I &s;hould have taken the Re&s;olution to go thither in Que&s;t of Employment. O! with what Plea&s;ure &s;hould I then have em|braced an Opportunity of bearing Arms again&s;t the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> my greate&s;t Enemies! They have giv|en me Provocations more than &s;ufficient to prompt me to a Revenge of all the bad U&s;age I have re|ceived from their Hands. But unhappily for me, by reducing me to a Condition, which leaves me no Room to hope ever being able to bear the Fa|tigues of War, they have deprived me of that Sa|tisfaction. My Strength could not but be ener|vated, and my Health entirely de&s;troyed, by the Unea&s;ine&s;s o&s; Mind, which they continually gave me, by the Hunger, which they obliged me to la|bour &s;o long a Time under, and by the Poi&s;on they gave me.</P>
<P>I diverted my &s;elf with all the&s;e plea&s;ing Hopes, though I was not yet a&s;&s;ured of obtaining my Li|berty. And I had really Rea&s;on to fear, that they would propo&s;e to me to remain in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and to &s;erve in the Army. A Propo&s;al of this Kind would, I confe&s;s, have involved me in a fre&s;h Perplexity. I &s;hould, on the one Hand, have ne|ver prevailed upon my &s;elf to pa&s;s my Time in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and a Refu&s;al of their Offer, might, on the other, have been very dangerous. But le&s;t I &s;hould be put to a Non-plus, in Ca&s;e they &s;hould make that Propo&s;al, I re&s;olved to excu&s;e my &s;elf on Account of the infirm State of my Health, which di&s;abled me from bearing Arms.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="382">
This Re&s;olution being taken, I had nothing to do but to be ea&s;y, and wait with Patience for what|ever might befal me. I &s;hall &s;end you many more Particulars, by the fir&s;t Courier, but you mu&s;t not yet expect to hear an End of my Misfortunes.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_MY la&s;t, without Doubt, removed all your Unea&s;ine&s;s on my Account, and gave you &s;ome Hopes of &s;eeing me again very &s;oon. I told you, at the &s;ame Time, that nothing new had befallen me. The Impatience and Concern you expre&s;s, for which I cannot but reprove you, only augment my Di&s;tre&s;s, and ag|gravate my Grief. You remind me of all my for|mer and pre&s;ent Sufferings in Terms &s;o pathetick, and &s;o moving, that I cannot but be greatly affect|ed therewith. All you &s;ay of the Plea&s;ures we have formerly enjoyed together, does not alleviate my pre&s;ent Mi&s;ery. Forbear, I be&s;eech you, Sir, to recall pa&s;t Joys to my Mind, and cea&s;e to expatiate on my Misfortunes, and the doleful Circum&s;tances of my Adventures.</P>
<P><Q><L>Cur me querelis exanimas tuis?</L></Q>
Which of us two is the mo&s;t to be pitied? Which has mo&s;t Cau&s;e to wi&s;h my Liberty? The Ab&s;ence of a Friend, who always had, and &s;till retains a mo&s;t tender regard for you, is, I mu&s;t own, af|flicting. But, however doleful your Condition may
<PB N="150" REF="383">
be, mine is much more &s;o. You have, at lea&s;t, the Comfort of being able to ea&s;e your Mind a thou&s;and Ways; but my Fate is very different from yours. Confined in a narrow Pri&s;on, I &s;ee no one, to alleviate my Grief, and am, at this very Time, uncertain whether I have more Grounds for Hope or Fear. You de&s;ire to know the final Term of my Mi&s;eries, as if it were in my Power to fix it. I plea&s;ed my &s;elf indeed with the Hopes of &s;eeing them &s;peedily ended, but an Accident, which has ju&s;t happened, has in a Mea&s;ure fru&s;trated all my De&s;igns. Give me Leave to relate this Cata&s;trophe, and the Manner how it came to my Knowledge.</P>
<P>The De&s;ire I had of being thoroughly acquainted with the Publick Affairs was one Day revived, when early in the Morning I &s;everal Times heard the Noi&s;e of Cannon. I would not however have you think it uncommon to be entertained in this Country with that Kind of Harmony. We are every Week diverted with &s;everal Di&s;charges of the Artillery. The Revielle and Tap-tow are always expre&s;&s;ed by firing Cannon, and the Time of re|pairing to Court is made known in the &s;ame Man|ner. A &s;urprizing Quantity of Powder is con&s;umed in this City. It is made u&s;e of on all Days of Re|joycing, which are here very frequent, on all Fe&s;|tivals, and on innumerable other Occa&s;ions. It may, perhaps, be intended to &s;tifle the terrible Noi&s;e and Uproar made at tho&s;e Times by Drun|kards. But let us leave this Conjecture, and enquire into the Rea&s;ons of a Di&s;charge of the Cannon &s;o early. As this was neither the Reveille nor the Tap-tow, nor was it the Time of Re&s;orting to Court, I im|mediately concluded, that &s;ome extraordinary Ac|cident mu&s;t have been the Occa&s;ion of it. The Si|tuation of the Affairs of <HI>Poland,</HI> at that Time, gave me directly &s;ome Su&s;picion, and as I was highly concerned for tho&s;e Matters, I could not be
<PB N="151" REF="384">
at Ea&s;e till I was farther informed. Above all, I feared this Event, be what it would, might pre|judice my Affairs, and, at the &s;ame Time, fru&s;|trate all my Hopes.</P>
<P>The Sequel but too plainly proves how well my Fears were founded, but I was not apprized of the Matter &s;o &s;oon as I wi&s;hed to be. In vain I asked my Guard, and begged they would inform me of what had happened. I found it impo&s;&s;ible to get any Intelligence. I prevailed upon one of them to go and enquire, what it was; but he &s;oon returned as wi&s;e as he went. I was very unea&s;y all that Day, and &s;pent it with an Impatience I am not ac|cu&s;tomed to. My Corporal, who was my chief Steward, came the next Day and told me, with a &s;miling Countenance, that the City of <HI>Dantzick</HI> was &s;urrendered to the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> I was thunder-&s;truck at this News, which I could never have expected, it &s;urprized me, and gave me very uncommon Emotions. Having, however, recovered my &s;elf a little, and taken Time to con&s;ider, I begun to doubt of the Truth of the Fact. I a&s;ked my Cor|poral, whether King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> was taken, but of this he pretended to be intirely ignorant. His An|&s;wer &s;erved only to encrea&s;e my Unea&s;ine&s;s. Du|bious of the Condition, to which that Prince might be reduced, I begun to bemoan his Fate, I entreated the Corporal to go out immediately, and to pro|cure an exact Account of all the Circum&s;tances of that great Event, and give me a Relation of what he could learn. In order to encourage him to a faithful Di&s;charge of his Commi&s;&s;ion, I gave him &s;ome Pieces of Silver, and promi&s;ed him more on his Return. But neither this little Pre&s;ent, nor my Promi&s;es, were prevalent enough to make him more &s;peedy; he did not return till the next Day, when he informed me, that King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> had been taken out of a Cellar, where he lay concealed. This
<PB N="152" REF="385">
ridiculous Circum&s;tance made me not give Credit to his News. And how could I with any Proba|bility imagine, that King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> would &s;uffer him&s;elf to be &s;eized in that Manner? He added, that &s;everal <HI>French</HI>-Men had been taken Pri&s;oners, and would &s;oon be brought to <HI>Peter&s;burg.</HI></P>
<P>Several other Circum&s;tances he related &s;eeming as improbable, made me &s;u&s;pend my Judgment upon the re&s;t. But nothing convinced me more than a &s;econd Di&s;charge of the Artillery, which I took for a clear Demon&s;tration. I then no longer doubted of what had been told me. I believed, that King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> was really fallen into the Hands of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and that the <HI>French</HI> were made Pri&s;oners of War. All this put me into &s;o great a Di&s;order, that my Guard began to perceive it. You know how zealous I have been, and always &s;hall be, for the Intere&s;t of <HI>France.</HI> I feared, on the other Hand, that this Di&s;a&s;ter of the <HI>French</HI> would give &s;ome fatal Turn to my Affairs, and prove an Ob&s;tacle to my wi&s;hed for Relea&s;ement. I not only found, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> were out of the Que&s;tion, but likewi&s;e that the Project which I had before formed, of retiring to the Hou&s;e of &s;ome Foreign Mini&s;ter, could not be executed without great Danger, and running the Hazard of being impri&s;oned for the re&s;t of my Life. I was well enough acquainted with the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> to know, to what Exce&s;s of In&s;olence one fortunate Event could carry them. Whil&s;t they are in Pro&s;perity, they neither regard the Laws of Nations, nor pub|lick Faith, nor, in &s;hort,
<Q><L>Quoecunque Altaria tangunt.</L></Q>
As I had given my Corporal a fre&s;h Commi&s;&s;ion to enquire after all the publick News, he informed me, that the &s;econd Di&s;charge of Artillery was, as
<PB N="153" REF="386">
well as the former, on Account of the taking of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> Pri&s;oners were arrived at <HI>Cron&s;tadt,</HI> that the Commander in chief, and a large Number of Officers, were already arrived at <HI>Peter&s;|burg,</HI> and la&s;tly, that they were that Day to dine at Court. He added, that King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> was not taken, but, as it was certain, that he was &s;till in <HI>Dantzick,</HI> he would not fail of being made Pri&s;oner, as the <HI>French</HI> were, and that he could never find Means of e&s;caping from the narrow Search that was made after him. I had now no longer Room, to doubt of the Truth of the greate&s;t Part of the&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances, tho they all appeared very &s;trange to me. How, &s;aid I, within my &s;elf, could &s;o &s;trong a City as <HI>Dantzick,</HI> a Place &s;o well defended, fall into the Hands of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians?</HI> Is it po&s;&s;ible, that the <HI>French</HI> Troops could &s;urrender them&s;elves Pri|&s;oners of War, and that King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> could neg|lect repairing to &s;ome Place of Safety?</P>
<P>The Advice, my Corporal had given me, of the Arrival of the <HI>French</HI> Officers at <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> rai&s;ed in me an exceeding great De&s;ire of &s;eeing them, and, to obtain this Satisfaction, I placed my &s;elf con|&s;tantly at my Windows, in Hopes of &s;eeing &s;ome one by Chance pa&s;s by my Pri&s;on. In this I hap|pened to &s;ucceed, and &s;aw the chief of them in Her Maje&s;ty's Coach; I knew them even by their A&s;pect, but could not po&s;&s;ibly di&s;tingui&s;h any one of my Acquaintance. I met &s;oon after with an Opportu|nity of &s;atisfying my Curio&s;ity. Mrs. <HI>De l'I&s;le</HI>'s Cook being recovered from his Indi&s;po&s;ition, paid me a Vi&s;it; I immediately a&s;ked him a Thou&s;and Que&s;tions about the pre&s;ent State of Affairs, and tho he was not able to &s;atisfy me in every Point I enquired after, yet he acquainted me thoroughly with many Things, which I was before ignorant of, and which I had not been able to learn either of my Guard, or their Corporal. He informed me that
<PB N="154" REF="387">
King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> had fortunately made his E&s;cape from <HI>Dantzick,</HI> but that nobody yet knew what was become of him: That the <HI>French</HI> Troops, which were come to the Relief of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> had been re|pul&s;ed, and obliged, after &s;everal fruitle&s;s Attempts, to capitulate, they not being numerous enough to render their Enterprize &s;ucce&s;sful. I wi&s;hed earne&s;t|ly to know what Steps the <HI>Swedes</HI> had taken, and what pa&s;&s;ed in other Parts of <HI>Poland,</HI> but my Intel|ligencer could not &s;atisfy my Curio&s;ity on either of tho&s;e Heads.</P>
<P>He confirmed, in a &s;econd Vi&s;it, his former Ad|vice, that King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> was no longer at <HI>Dant|zick,</HI> and that he was thought to be in Safety in &s;ome Part of the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI>'s Dominions. Tho the Situation of that Prince's Affairs appeared to me very melancholy, I could not but e&s;teem him happy in having delivered him&s;elf from &s;o imminent a Dan|ger, and e&s;caped all the Pur&s;uits of the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> I could hear nothing of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> but that they continued very peaceable, without determining in Favour of either Party, or that any one could pene|trate their real De&s;igns. He told me the Names of the <HI>French</HI> Officers, who had been taken Pri&s;oners, and, among others, nam'd <HI>Mon&s;. de la Motthe,</HI> who was at the Head of them, and is an old Acquaintance of mine. I leave you to jndge, how much I lament|ed the Fate of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who are thus reduced to the Nece&s;&s;ity of giving up their Swords into the Hands of the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> Strange Fate! that Sol|diers &s;o brave, as they, &s;hould be obliged to &s;ub|mit to Slaves &s;o vile! I cannot here omit the Recital of a Story, which I have heard, and appears to me very &s;ingular, if we may venture to give Credit thereto. In the fir&s;t Interview the <HI>French</HI> Officers had with the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Generals, the latter, addre&s;|&s;ing them&s;elves to <HI>Mon&s;. de la Motthe,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed a very great Surprize, that the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould attack
<PB N="155" REF="388">
their Intrenchments without a &s;ingle Di&s;charge of Cannon. To this, <HI>Mon&s;. de la Motthe</HI> is &s;aid to have replied; that was a common Method with the <HI>French.</HI> The <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Generals, if this Story be true, mu&s;t certainly know very little of the pre&s;ent Method of making an Attnck; and for their better In&s;truction on that Head, it might not be ami&s;s to &s;end them, into <HI>Poland,</HI> &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Carabiniers,</HI> who were at the Battle of <HI>Gua&s;talla.</HI></P>
<P>The Cook, from whom I received my Intelli|gences, informed me, moreover, that the Articles of Capitulation granted to the <HI>French</HI> Troops had been violated, and that the <HI>Marquis de Monti</HI> had, not|with&s;tanding the &s;acred Character, wherewith he was inve&s;ted, been put under Confinement. Had any other Nation, be&s;ides the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> been ac|cus'd of the&s;e Proceedings, I readily confe&s;s, I &s;hould not have &s;o ea&s;ily given Credit to the Report of them: But I was thoroughly acquainted with the Conduct and Policy of tho&s;e Gentlemen, and not ig|norant that nothing was to them either venerable or &s;acred. Was not, therefore, my Cen&s;ure ju&s;t. When I ob&s;erved before, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites, Quaecunque Altaria tangunt,</HI> whil&s;t flu&s;hed with Succe&s;s. This may be called a glorious Beginning of a War. To break through the principal Articles of a Capitulati|on, to arre&s;t an Amba&s;&s;ador, and to detain him, &s;o long, under a rigorous Impri&s;onment! Are not the&s;e Things without a Precedent, in a civilized Nation? Are they &s;o very blind, that they cannot perceive the Irregularity of their Conduct? The Time may come when they will perhaps have Rea|&s;on to repent of it. Tho&s;e, in who&s;e Hands the Admini&s;tration of Affairs in that Country is, ought, in my Opinion, to proceed with more Circum&s;pec|tion. If they will have no Regard to the Honour of the Nation, or its Intere&s;ts, they ought at lea&s;t to have the Glory of their Sovereign at Heart, and not
<PB N="156" REF="389">
expo&s;e it in &s;o flagrant a Manner. They have pre|vailed on Her Maje&s;ty, by their evil Coun&s;els, to commit an Act of Inju&s;tice, not only unparalleled, but wholly incon&s;i&s;tent with her natural Candour. And what can be more vile, than to treat a brave Officer, who is only guilty by having &s;erved his Ma&s;ter with Fidelity, in &s;o worthle&s;s a Manner? Have they any Thing to alledge again&s;t his Con|duct? And with what Views do they thus detain him? If I may give Credit to what I have been told at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> the Impri&s;onment of that Mini|&s;ter crys for Vengeance, and this Action mu&s;t be looked upon as the blacke&s;t and mo&s;t unju&s;t, that can be perpetrated. The Inhabitants of <HI>Dantzick</HI> inform me, that he kept within the Bounds of his Mini&s;try, and ought he con&s;equently not to meet with the Treatment pre&s;cribed, in that Ca&s;e, by the Law of Nations. But let us, for a Moment, &s;up|po&s;e he actually had exceeded the Bounds of his Character, mu&s;t he, for that, be deprived of all Liberty? He would, in any other Country, if he had required it, have been &s;et free, on his Parole of Honour. But the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> do not act in this Manner, they ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in the Practice of their barbarous Cu&s;toms, and little Regard what other Nations would do, in a parallel Ca&s;e. It is accounted a Crime in the Marquis <HI>De Monti,</HI> that he &s;hewed &s;o great a Zeal for the Service of his Ma|&s;ter, and was &s;o firmly attached to the Prince, to whom he was &s;ent. I &s;hould expatiate too much on this Affair, were I to make all the Reflections it would admit of: I proceed, therefore, to what re|lates to my &s;elf, which I intend for the Subject of this Letter.</P>
<P>After having exhau&s;ted my Intelligencer's whole Fund, I drew from him a Promi&s;e to vi&s;it me oft|ner, and give me an exact Account of whatever he could learn. This hone&s;t Man did really exert him&s;elf,
<PB N="157" REF="390">
on this Occa&s;ion, and was of great Service to me, during the whole Time of my Captivity. The Plea&s;ure I received from hearing the publick News, did not, however, abate the earne&s;t De&s;ire I had to recover my Liberty. To my Sorrow I found, that no An&s;wer was made to my Repre&s;entation, tho it had been &s;o long pre&s;ented. The fir&s;t Mention I heard of it was by my Steward, who told me, a Report was current, that I &s;hould &s;oon be relea&s;ed. This News I the more readily believed, as I thought, that after I had &s;o clearly vindicated my &s;elf, they had no farther Rea&s;on to detain me in Pri&s;on. I was afterwards informed, that my Memorial had been referred to the <HI>Czarina</HI>'s Cabinet Council, and that from thence I was to expect a final Determina|tion. The Members of the Senate, as, I think, I ob&s;erved before, are regarded only as mere Un|derlings, entirely under the Influence of the Mini|&s;ters, who are Foreigners. The&s;e latter govern with an ab&s;olute Power, all is under their Management, and their Di&s;po&s;al; and this gave me Room to think, that from them I was to expect my Liberty.</P>
<P>My Affairs were retarded by the <HI>Czarina</HI>'s De|parture into the Country, for the Summer-Sea&s;on. Her Maje&s;ty was accompanied by the whole Court, and the Mini&s;ters of the fir&s;t Rank. At this Time, I was once more obliged to remove to another Pri&s;on. I was carried to the very Place, where the Senate a&s;&s;embles. This removal occa&s;ioned me to remark in my Journal, that I had been led <HI>ab Herode ad Pilatum,</HI> I might have added, <HI>a Pilato ad Calvari|um:</HI> For, after all the Mi&s;eries I had undergone, I had only this la&s;t Step to take. The Motive, that induced them to remove me from my former Pri&s;on, very plainly demon&s;trates, how little they were con|cerned for my Life. The Members of the Senate being apprized, that the Hou&s;e, where they met, was in a ruinous State, thought proper to quit it, and
<PB N="158" REF="391">
to a&s;&s;emble in that, wherein I was confined. What think you, Sir, of this Expedient, to rid them&s;elves of a Man, whom they had already obliged to pa&s;s <HI>per ignem &amp; aquam,</HI> but both without Succe&s;s. They probably thought, that after I had with&s;tood Poi&s;on, endured the Fatigue of a long and toil&s;ome Journey, laboured under Famine, and all the Mi|&s;eries, I had been expo&s;ed to, they had no other Means left of ha&s;tning my Death, than by burying me alive under the Ruins of an old decayed Build|ing. Their black De&s;ign, happily for me, proved abortive; for Providence, which had hitherto, al|mo&s;t miraculou&s;ly, pre&s;erved my Life, continued &s;till favourable to me, and &s;o di&s;po&s;ed Matters, that what was intended to be the Cau&s;e of my Per|dition, turned to my Advantage, and &s;erved only to render my Confinement more agreeable.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found my &s;elf be&s;et, in my new Apart|ment, by all kinds of Artificers, Architects, Joyn|ers, Carpenters, Ma&s;ons, and other &s;orts of People, who were continually going in and out of my Cham|ber. With Plea&s;ure I &s;aw &s;o great a Concour&s;e of People, which, at any other Time, would have been trouble&s;ome to me. I made frequent Enquiries, what Condition the Building was in, and whether I was not in Danger of being cru&s;hed under the Ru|ins of it: Thus I continued in con&s;tant Fear, though I was told I might depend on my Safety. I enter|tained no great Opinion of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Architects, and the Per&s;on, to who&s;e Direction this Work was entru&s;ted, appeared to me not the be&s;t qualified, to judge of the Danger, I was expo&s;ed to. As he &s;poke <HI>Italian,</HI> I was curious to know by what Means he learnt that Language. He told me, he had travelled into <HI>Italy,</HI> and, on his Return, entered into the Service of an <HI>Italian</HI> Architect, who had in&s;tructed him both in his Language and Art. His Skill in the latter was not &s;o great, that I could de|pend
<PB N="159" REF="392">
on his Word; I therefore examined every Part of the Building my &s;elf, and, with a Plummet in Hand, &s;hewed my unexperienced Engineer tho&s;e Places which were in the mo&s;t ruinous Condition. He complyed pretty readily with my Directions, and it happened fortunately for me, that he followed them, in Regard to the Arched Roof of a large Hall, which &s;tood in Need of Shoring: For had he executed his fir&s;t Plan, and neglected the Mea|&s;ures I pointed out to him, that Roof would certain|ly have fallen, and drawn after it the other Parts of the Building, which were all in a tottering Condi|tion.</P>
<P>Employments of this kind, on which I &s;pent the be&s;t Part of my Time, afforded me a very great Plea&s;ure. I may truly &s;ay, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are very ignorant of any Thing relating to Edifices of Stone, but mu&s;t do them the Ju&s;tice, to acknow|ledge, that they are very expert in whatever relates to Carpentry. They know the U&s;e of no other In&s;tru|ment, but the Axe, and this they handle with &s;o much Dexterity, that not a &s;ingle Nail is made u&s;e of in the Structure of their large&s;t Hou&s;es. The&s;e Buildings are made of large Pieces of Timber, join|ed together, in &s;uch Manner, that, in Ca&s;e of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, they may, without much Trouble, be loo&s;|ened, and afterwards replaced as they were before. Hence you may ea&s;ily judge, that all the&s;e Buildings are portable. Whoever is minded to remove from one part of the City to the other, immediately lays his Hou&s;e on Carts, and tran&s;ports it, with little Expence, wherever he thinks fit. All Buildings in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> are erected in this Manner, excepting &s;ome Churches, and mo&s;t of the Convents of the Monks, who always take Care to be the be&s;t accommodated every where. I have even &s;een &s;ome fortified Cities, the Walls of which are only made of Wood. Hou&s;es of this Kind, in &s;o rigid a Climate, as that of <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI>
<PB N="160" REF="393">
may be thought to be as cold, as Ice-Hou&s;es; but I'm convinced, by Experience, of the direct con|trary, and can a&s;&s;ure you, that they are all very warm, nay even hot to Exce&s;s. <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> may, in this Regard be e&s;teemed not a cold Country, as it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, but a Country abounding with Fire and Smoak. There is hardly a Hou&s;e in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> where the Heat is not intolerable, in the Winter, as well as the Summer. We may therefore very rea|&s;onably conclude, that this contributes not a little to render the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> lazy and &s;luggi&s;h.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Sir, how little my Troubles hindered me from making Ob&s;ervations in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> I might extend them yet farther, on the Manners of the <HI>Mu&s;|covites,</HI> as well as their Cu&s;toms; but I fear, I &s;hall engage in too many Subjects at once, and thereby neglect the principal Occurrences of my Captivity. Give me, therefore, leave to return to what more nearly concerns my &s;elf.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I employed my &s;elf in Architecture, my Steward informed me, that my Relea&s;ement was now talked of in good Earne&s;t, and that I had no|thing to do, but to be of good Heart. <HI>Mon&s;. de L'I&s;le</HI> and his Spou&s;e &s;ent me Word, at the &s;ame Time, that they thought my Affairs in a very good Situation, and that they did not doubt of &s;eeing &s;peedily my Troubles at an End. But the Joy, I conceived, at hearing this agreeable News, was of a &s;hort Duration. I was &s;oon afterwards told, that I mu&s;t not hope for any An&s;wer to my Memorial, till her Maje&s;ty's Return. I had enough to do, to appea&s;e the fir&s;t Tran&s;ports into which this &s;econd News threw me, but Rea&s;on at la&s;t got the better, and gave me Re&s;olution, patiently to expect what|ever might befal me.</P>
<P>I received, in the mean Time, numerous Pre|&s;ents from Mrs. <HI>De L'I&s;le,</HI> who frequently &s;ent me her Cook. This generous Lady loaded me with
<PB N="161" REF="394">
her Benefactions, and u&s;ed her utmo&s;t Efforts to al|leviate the Burden of my Captivity. Her Cook, for his Part, neglected nothing that might give me a clear In&s;ight into the mo&s;t important Tran&s;|actions of <HI>Europe.</HI> By his Means, I learned, that two notable Battles had been fought, tho&s;e of <HI>Bi|tonto,</HI> and <HI>Parma,</HI> and that the Surrender of <HI>Phi|lip&s;burg</HI> was hourly expected. Such Succe&s;&s;es re|joiced me extreamly. I could not, however, but &s;ecretly envy the immortal Glory, acquired by &s;o many brave Officers of my Acquaintance. He, likewi&s;e, told me, that King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> was in Safe|ty at <HI>Konigsberg,</HI> that the taking of <HI>Dantzick</HI> had neither weakened nor dejected his Party, and that this City would be re&s;tored for a Sum of Money. I never doubted, but the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> would exact exorbitant Sums from the Inhabitants of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> which I knew to be the principal Object of their Enterprize. I was informed, moreover, by the &s;ame Me&s;&s;enger, that all the <HI>French</HI> Officers were &s;et out for <HI>Narva,</HI> where the Pri&s;oners of War were guarded by two Battalions of <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> An ac|cidental Thought came, on this Occa&s;ion, into my Head, which you perhaps will regard as &s;trange and whim&s;ical. I had been a&s;&s;ured, that the <HI>French</HI> Troops made a Body of about two thou&s;and Men, a Number little inferior to that of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> by whom they were guarded: I was not unacquaint|ed with the intrepid Courage of the former, and too well convinc'd of the Cowardice of the latter, and the bad Di&s;cipline they are under. Having con&s;idered the&s;e Things, I &s;aid within my &s;elf, might not the <HI>French</HI> Pri&s;oners find Means to cut off their Guard, to di&s;arm and ma&s;&s;acre them, and then to force them&s;elves a Pa&s;&s;age, thro the Coun|try. I was not ignorant of the Difficulty which mu&s;t needs attend the Execution of that Enterprize: But the Place occupied by the <HI>French,</HI> near <HI>Narva,</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="395">
has always been fertile in extraordinary Events, and I was confirmed in my Opinion by recollecting the Retreat of ten thou&s;and <HI>Greeks,</HI> under <HI>Xenophon.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> of tho&s;e Days were certainly not more valorous than the <HI>French</HI> now, and the Route the&s;e latter mu&s;t take to arrive at a Place of Safety, is not by far &s;o long as that, taken by the former. The <HI>French</HI> would thereby have acquired immor|tal Glory, and the Retreat would have gained as univer&s;al an Applau&s;e, as the World to this Day gives to the ten thou&s;and <HI>Greeks</HI> commanded by <HI>Xenophon.</HI> Let me entreat you, before you cen&s;ure this Scheme as impractible, to examine in the Maps, whether the Route, which the <HI>French</HI> mu&s;t have taken to join the Troops of King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> would have rendered the Undertaking utterly impo&s;&s;ible. Had they exerted their Valour, and undergone &s;ome Fatigues, I am well a&s;&s;ured they would &s;oon have executed this important Enterprize. As for the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> by whom they were guarded, no|thing could have been more ea&s;y, than to have got rid of them, and was you as well acquainted with that Nation, as I am, you would be entirely of my Opinion. But to convince you yet more of what I here advance, permit me to add a Word or two more, of the Military State of <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI></P>
<P>As I &s;uppo&s;e you to be already acquainted with their Battalions and Squadrons, I &s;hall not take Notice of either of them. They con&s;i&s;t of a large Number of Soldiers, but of very few Officers. All the&s;e Soldiers have of late been very well cloath'd, and their Arms are pretty good, except|ing their Swords. They retain, notwith&s;tanding this, a certain Air, which is by no Means to their Advantage, and which none of them have ever been able to &s;hake off. They make a wretched Appearance, and are far from being dextrous. They are well enough made, very robu&s;t, and ad|vantageou&s;ly
<PB N="163" REF="396">
&s;haped, but they are, if I may U&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion, lifele&s;s Bodies which are not put in Motion, without great Difficulty. As for their Di&s;cipline, they are con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed, and handle their Arms pretty well: But when they come to give Fire, their Emulation only con&s;i&s;ts, in en|deavouring to make the mo&s;t Noi&s;e, without ever concerning them&s;elves, whether they hit the Mark, or their Shot is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>They have always appeared to me very much embarra&s;&s;ed, when they perform their Evolutions.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;urprizes me more, than to &s;ee what a Value they &s;et upon their Grenadoes; for not a Day of Exerci&s;e pa&s;&s;es, but they throw a prodigi|ous Number of them, and they take a particular Care to choo&s;e the mo&s;t able Men for Grenadiers. They have hardly any Regard for their Swords, and all that I have &s;een, in the Hands of my Guard, during the whole Cour&s;e of my Captivity, are round-pointed. I could not forbear &s;miling at the Manner whereby they account for this: Tho&s;e pointed Swords, &s;ay they, are u&s;ele&s;s, as long as we have Bayonets. Poor, ignorant Wretches, not yet to know what U&s;e may be made of a Sword! The <HI>Swedes</HI> have, neverthele&s;s, formerly taught them the Benefit of this Weapon, which I wonder to find they have &s;o &s;oon forgot. It is not my De&s;ign here to cen&s;ure this their Cu&s;tom, as 'tis not very material, how they Act, provided they know, how to make an Attack, and to defend them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But this is not all. The <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops di&s;|cover neither Emulation, Valour, nor Conduct, Qualities, in&s;eparable from a good Soldier. Nei|ther Officers, nor Soldiers, are ever &s;een to aim at di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves by any con&s;picuous Acti|on. Neither one nor the other have any Motive for engaging in Military Service, but that of o|beying
<PB N="164" REF="397">
the Orders of their Sovereign. Thus have I &s;hewn you, in few Words, what Idea we can have of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops. I have formerly told you their Number, let us now therefore exa|mine what regards their Maintenance.</P>
<P>The Apparel of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops is pretty good, but their Pay is very bad. Tho&s;e, who are garri&s;oned at <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> have only an Allowance of Bread, and about fifteen <HI>French Deniers per diem.</HI> Tho&s;e, who are in the Inland Countries, are obli|ged to be contented with only &s;even or eight <HI>De|niers,</HI> a very poor Pay indeed. The Allowance of the Officers is likewi&s;e, very moderate, and far from being &s;ufficient to enable them to keep a tolerable Table. However trifling this their Pay may &s;eem, it &s;uffices neverthele&s;s for them, and a larger Salary would be needle&s;s. The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are content with a very little. Their ordinary Food is only Bread, with a little Salt, and &s;ome Water. When they have no Bread, they eat Pea&s;e, Beans or Vegetables. They are out of Danger of being &s;tarved with Hunger, for if they are de&s;titute of Bread, Meat and Pul&s;e, they can brow&s;e upon Gra&s;s, and eat all kind of Roots, without the lea&s;t Inconvenience attending it. Bodies &s;o robu&s;t might form excellent Troops, were it po&s;&s;ible to in&s;pire them with other Souls, and other Minds. The Hor&s;es in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> are endued with very near the &s;ame Qualities as the Men; for they feed upon whatever they meet with, and are not the le&s;s vi|gorous.</P>
<P>Hence you may judge, how ea&s;ily a good Ge|neral, at the Head of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops, might &s;upport his Army; he would neither &s;tand in need of Bread, nor Cattle; a few Pul&s;e, &s;ome Herbs and Roots would be more than &s;ufficient, and the&s;e Provi&s;ions may be had every where, with little Trouble and Expence. 'Tis happy for the neigh|bouring
<PB N="165" REF="398">
Nations, that tho&s;e Troops will never be able to render them&s;elves formidable, and though their Fame in <HI>Europe</HI> is at pre&s;ent very great, yet the Time will come, when their Weakne&s;s and Im|potence will be univer&s;ally known. There are not wanting tho&s;e, who for &s;ome Time pa&s;t have en|tertain'd too favourable an Opinion of this Nation. There was hardly a &s;ingle <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Soldier, be|fore the Siege of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> who had ever &s;een a Mu&s;ket fired, and the World has neverthele&s;s load|ed them with Prai&s;es, which they by no Means de|&s;erve. People may entertain what Notion they plea&s;e of the&s;e Soldiers, but I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee their Performances in a Battle, and till then, I &s;hall hardly be inclined to be&s;tow any Encomiums on them. I believe, they may &s;tand their Ground, for a Time, for they are &s;turdy enough; but, at the &s;ame Time, it is more than probable, they will not be for fighting. <HI>Peter</HI> I. after the Battle of <HI>Narva,</HI> where all his Army was routed, was thoughtful of an Expedient to hinder his Troops from taking to their Flight, but could find no better than that of forming a kind of &s;econd Line, behind each Battalion and Squadron, whom he &s;trictly enjoined, to fire upon every one, that &s;hould be &s;o cowardly as to retreat. This Pre|caution will, in all Probability, be &s;till made U&s;e of, to force their Soldiers to &s;tand their Ground, and not be &s;o ea&s;ily broken. When they &s;ee them&s;elves between two Fires, they may &s;ome|times perhaps be obliged, to make a Virtue of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity. But can you imagine, that Troops, who &s;tand in Need of &s;uch a Spur, can ever fight with Courage and Vigour. I much doubt, or believe rather, that the&s;e poor <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> &s;eeing them&s;elves between two Fires, will rather &s;ubmit to be ma&s;|&s;acred and cut to Pieces, without making any great Re&s;i&s;tance. But in&s;tead of detaining you with
<PB N="166" REF="399">
the&s;e Conjectures, let us rather examine the great Exploits performed by the&s;e Troops, &s;ince their coming into <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>In my Pa&s;&s;age through <HI>Dantzick</HI> I was informed, as I believe I told you before, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> had not di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by any one con|&s;picuous Action, during the Siege of that City. This is &s;o true, that in the Cour&s;e of &s;ix or &s;even Months, they could not even gain the Outworks of the Place, though they are at &s;ome Di&s;tance from the Town, and only fenced with Palli&s;edoes. What valiant Deed have they rendered them&s;elves famous by, &s;ince the Surrender of that City? They have pur&s;ued, and endeavoured, by Force, to re|duce the Troops, who followed the Party of King <HI>Stani&s;laus;</HI> but hitherto their Efforts have been fruitle&s;s.

The <HI>Mu&s;co|vites,</HI> on the contrary, had, in diver&s;e Places, &s;e|veral large Bodies of Troops, in the Field, which were more than &s;ufficient, for a greater Enterprize. The Troops of King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> notwith&s;tanding this, keep their Ground in <HI>Poland,</HI> traver&s;e the whole Country, in the very Sight of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Sax|on</HI> Armies, intercept their Convoys, and have in|&s;ulted, and even beat their Enemies in &s;everal Skir|mi&s;hes. Hence you may judge, what the Event would have been, if a Body of about fifteen thou|&s;and <HI>French</HI> Foot, had joined the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Cavalry. The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> would, beyond all Doubt, have &s;oon be enrouted, and the <HI>Poles</HI> might ju&s;tly have &s;aid,

What I here a&s;&s;ert would infallibly have hap|pened, and we &s;hould &s;oon have &s;een the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI> under a Nece&s;&s;ity of evacuating <HI>Poland.</HI> A General who is but never &s;o little acquainted with the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Troops, would meet with no great Dif|ficulty in &s;ubduing them.

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_BEFORE I begun to write this Letter, I intended only to advi&s;e you, that I was freed from my Captivity, and upon the Point of quitting <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> Upon &s;econd Thoughts, I altered my De&s;ign, and believed it proper to continue the Hi&s;tory of my Captivity, and to inform you of the I&s;&s;ue of my Adventures. The Peru&s;al of this la&s;t Letter will, perhaps, give you Cau&s;e to be &s;urprized at the Con&s;tancy, with which I have undergone &s;o many different Trials, as would, perhaps, have thrown any one, but my &s;elf, into De&s;pair; I have many a Time earne&s;tly wi&s;hed you an Eye-Witne&s;s of the Evils I have &s;truggled with, and of the Heroick Courage with which I have born them. I am not induced to &s;peak in this Manner, either out of Pre&s;umption, or with any De&s;ign of attracting your Prai&s;es: The Fa|miliarity, you Honour me with, is &s;uch, that I may tell you my Mind without any Di&s;gui&s;e, and you know me &s;o well, that you cannot think me capable of deceiving you. I am not ignorant, and I think it my Duty to acknowledge, that the Hand
<PB N="169" REF="402">
of the Almighty, after having humbled me, has graciou&s;ly vouch&s;afed me Relief, to prevent my total Fall. 'Tis the &s;ame Hand, that loo&s;ened my Chains, after having &s;uffered me to be bound with them, and after a rigid Captivity has &s;et me at Liberty, that, in fine, after having led me to the very Brinkof the Grave, has re&s;tored me, as it were by a Miracle, to my Health. The&s;e Calamities, which I have under|gone, &s;eem, by a providential Di&s;po&s;ition, to have been intended to recall me from my pa&s;t Errors. <HI>Hinc omne Principium, huc refer exitum.</HI></P>
<P>But to continue the Sequel of my Adventures, and leave the&s;e Reflexions. In my la&s;t I informed you, that it had been &s;ignified to me, I could not be relea&s;ed from Pri&s;on, and obtain my entire Liberty, till the <HI>Czarina</HI>'s Return, and that, with the utmo&s;t Impatience, I waited for the happy Moment. This gave me Room to hope, that my Liberty would then, in good Earne&s;t, be thought of. I found, neverthele&s;s, maugre all the&s;e Promi|&s;es, no &s;mall Difficulty, to bring my Affairs to an End. I could not conceive how they could be &s;o long put off, after having been in the Hands of &s;uch eminent Mini&s;ters. The Matter was not of &s;o great Importance, but they might have been con|cluded in one Day. The only Points they had to examine, were, whether I was to be deemed a Cri|minal in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> for having had an Adventure in <HI>France,</HI> and whether I ought to be detained Pri&s;oner, for having travelled by a fictitious Name? The&s;e were, in Reality, all the Crimes I could be accu&s;ed of, and for which I had been arre&s;ted.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was thus in Hopes every Minute of being &s;et at Liberty, I was &s;eized with a fre&s;h Di|&s;temper, which was the more fatal, as I had not then perfectly recovered my former Strength. A certain kind of Wine, which had been given me to drink, without my perceiving immediately that it was da|maged, cau&s;ed this Indi&s;po&s;ition. I was &s;oon re|duced
<PB N="170" REF="403">
to a very pitiful State. My Sickne&s;s was vi|olent, it increa&s;ed daily, and I had no Pro&s;pect of any Remedy. Since they were &s;o cruel, as to re|fu&s;e me a Phy&s;ician, at a Time, when I &s;tood yet more in Need of one, I could not expect they would grant me that Favour now. After having, for &s;ome Days, endured the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Pains, I found my &s;elf at la&s;t nece&s;&s;itated to demand an Interpreter.</P>
<P>I obtained one at Length, after many Prayers and Intreaties, who came to me on the 18th of <HI>Sep|tember.</HI> Take Notice, I be&s;eech you of this Epoch, and recollect, what I mentioned of it formerly. I thought proper to acquaint this Per&s;on with my Condition: I told him, that I had Occa&s;ion for a Phy&s;ician, and &s;hould be glad, if Mr. <HI>Du Vernoi,</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of Anatomy, might be permitted to vi&s;it me. I had the Plea&s;ure, the next Day, of &s;eeing Mr. <HI>Du Vernoi</HI> come into my Pri&s;on, accompanied by my Interpreter. I leave you to judge how much I rejoiced to &s;ee him. I thought my &s;elf happy in being allowed to conver&s;e with a rea&s;onable Crea|ture, a Satisfaction, I had not enjoyed for a very long Time. His Pre&s;ence only was in Part my Cure: But I repre&s;ented my Ca&s;e to him, and he a&s;&s;ured me, that I &s;hould have all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance I might &s;tand in Need of. The Interpreter, who &s;tayed with us, whil&s;t I di&s;cour&s;ed with this Gen|tleman, acquitted him&s;elf of his Commi&s;&s;ion, with a mo&s;t &s;urprizing Dexterity. He had doubtle&s;s been charged to hearken attentively to whatever was &s;poke, in Order to make his Report of it af|terwards: For, when I chanced to drop a few <HI>La|tin</HI> Words, which were unintelligible to him, he de|&s;ired to know what I &s;aid. I &s;atisfied his Curio&s;ity, and even added, that I had no Secret to communi|cate to any one, and that the only Thing I had long earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for, was, to inform the <HI>Czar|ina,</HI> and her Mini&s;ters, of all my Affairs. Diffi|dence
<PB N="171" REF="404">
is really carried to too great a Height in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> even in Matters of the lea&s;t Importance.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Du Vernoi</HI> retired, after a pretty long Vi&s;it, with a Promi&s;e to return, and keep me Company all the next Day. This Favour, which I little ex|pected, occa&s;ioned me to think, that I &s;hould now meet with different Treatment, and not fail of being &s;oon &s;et at Liberty. But the&s;e Hopes, which ap|peared &s;o well grounded, were of a very &s;hort Du|ration. Mr. <HI>Du Vernoi,</HI> who had promi&s;ed to vi|&s;it me the next Day, never came, and in vain I expected him the Day following; in &s;hort, I &s;aw him no more during my Captivity. I could never be apprized by any one what could be the Cau&s;e of this Di&s;appointment. Mr. <HI>Du Vernoi</HI> was a Gentleman of too much Di&s;cretion to mention it to me, but I could ea&s;ily conceive the Motive. As I was well a&s;&s;ured, that this celebrated Anatomi&s;t, would have performed his Promi&s;e, I &s;oon conjectured, that he had received an Order to the contrary, of which I am per&s;uaded for the following Rea&s;on: In the Conver&s;ation I had with him, I entered into a circum&s;tantial Account of the Di&s;ea&s;e I had laboured under, at my Departure from <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> without, however, mentioning my Su&s;picion of having been poi&s;oned. The Interpreter, who heard, all I &s;aid, may be pre&s;umed to have acquainted the Mini&s;ters therewith, and they being apprehen&s;ive this My|&s;tery of Iniquity would be detected, enjoined Mr. <HI>Du Vernoi</HI> to pay me no farther Vi&s;its. To &s;up|ply the Want of a Phy&s;ician, they &s;ent me &s;ome Medicines, by an unknown Per&s;on. I re&s;olved not to make U&s;e of any of their Drugs, but to wait for my Cure from the Strength of my Con&s;titution only. The Relief I every Day received from Mr. <HI>De L'I&s;le</HI> and his Spou&s;e, and which &s;ufficed for the be&s;t Part of my Nece&s;&s;ities, contributed not a little to the Recovery of my Health. I may ju&s;tly
<PB N="172" REF="405">
&s;ay, that to them I am indebted for my Life; for, had I not met with this Succour, from their Hands, I mu&s;t infallibly have &s;unk under the Weight of my Mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> not only refu&s;ed me what was requi&s;ite for my Health, as well as my Food, but likewi&s;e &s;uffered me to be almo&s;t naked. This cruel Treatment obliged me once more to a&s;k for an In|terpreter. My Reque&s;t was complied with, and I de&s;ired him to remon&s;trate to tho&s;e Gentlemen, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;ince the Proofs I had given of my Innocence ap|peared to them not &s;ufficiently convincing, for my Relea&s;ement, and &s;ince the Motive of Chri|&s;tian Charity was not &s;trong enough to induce them to grant me the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, requi&s;ite for my Health, I hoped at lea&s;t, that they would &s;o far regard the Glory of her Maje&s;ty's Name, as not to reduce me to &s;o mi&s;erable a Condition, to be even de&s;titute of wherewithal to cover my Na|kedne&s;s, and that, in &s;hort, they would order the Cloaths, which were in my Trunk, to be de|livered to me, for my U&s;e."</Q> This Interpreter re|turned the next Morning, and, in An&s;wer to my De&s;ire, &s;aid, that a Pre&s;ent of ten Rubles had been ordered for cloathing me. Di&s;&s;atisfied with this An&s;wer, I told him, that I did not want their Mo|ney, and that, if they would not grant me my Cloaths, I begged they would &s;end me a Taylor, whom I might order to make me what I &s;tood in Need of. The Interpreter retired, and I &s;aw, after this, neither a Taylor, nor my Cloaths, in&s;omuch, that I was obliged to remain in my Pri&s;on half naked, tho the cold Sea&s;on was already pretty far advanced.</P>
<P>It may not be improper here to take Notice, that nothing could be done without the preci&s;e Or|der of the Senate, and that con&s;equently it is they who have been the Cau&s;e of all the bad Treatment
<PB N="173" REF="406">
I have met with. The&s;e Gentlemen were, at that &s;ame Time, once more plea&s;ed to oblige me to &s;hift my Pri&s;on, and as they begun to feel the Cold in the new Apartment they were in, removed to their former Hou&s;e, which had been repaired, and &s;ent me to that, which they left. This la&s;t Change was no Inconvenience, for I was in a larger Place, where I enjoyed a greater Tranquility.</P>
<P>I &s;ilently pa&s;s by a large Number of Occurrences of little Importance, as I hope, that this Letter will be the la&s;t, which I &s;hall write to you; for I &s;hould never have done, were I to attempt an accurate Account of every Circum&s;tance of my Captivity. I &s;hall rather now entertain you with an Account of my Relea&s;ement, and the Means, that were made U&s;e of to procure it. I &s;hall with much greater Plea&s;ure relate the&s;e Circum&s;tances, and inform you of the happy Hour when I heard this good News, than of the Calamities I have undergone &s;ince the Reginning of my Impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>It was the 16th of <HI>October,</HI> when Word was brought me, that I &s;hould &s;oon be &s;et at Liberty. This News, which was certainly the mo&s;t agree|able I ever received in my Life, was communi|cated to me, that Day, very early, by a <HI>German</HI> Secretary, who was accompanied by an Interpreter. He told me in the <HI>Czarina</HI>'s Name, that I was relea&s;ed, and that a hundred Rubles had been grant|ed for my Travelling Charges. I returned the&s;e Gentlemen Thanks for the Trouble they had taken, a&s;&s;uring them at the &s;ame Time, that I &s;hould re|ceive whatever &s;hould be offered me, by Her Ma|je&s;ty's Order, with a mo&s;t profound Deference. They a&s;ked me then, whether I had any further Commands, to which I replied, that I de&s;ired no|thing el&s;e, but that they would prepare the nece&s;|&s;ary Pa&s;&s;es for my &s;peedy Departure. This was all the Di&s;cour&s;e I had with tho&s;e Me&s;&s;engers. But
<PB N="174" REF="407">
I repeated my Entreaty to the Interpreter, to pro|cure me the Key of my Trunk, in order to come at &s;ome Cloaths, that I might pay a Vi&s;it to my Friends. He promi&s;ed in&s;tantly to comply with my De&s;ire.</P>
<P>Here I imagine I &s;ee you congratulating me, with a &s;miling and &s;atisfied Countenance, on this happy Change, but moderate, I be&s;eech you, for &s;ome Time at lea&s;t, your Tran&s;ports of Joy. This News was &s;till only an Amu&s;ement. In vain I ex|pected, during the whole Day, to &s;ee them come and open my Trunk, and di&s;charge my Guard. I eat nothing but a Mor&s;el of dry Bread; for as I propo&s;ed to Dine with Mr. <HI>De L'I&s;le,</HI> I had pro|vided nothing. The next Day I &s;aw none but my Steward, who gave me &s;ome Victuals, without tel|ling me a Word of what had pa&s;&s;ed. At Length, on the 18th, that remarkable Epoch, I was hon|oured with a kind of Amba&s;&s;y, con&s;i&s;ting of an Interpreter, three or four Clerks, and &s;everal other Per&s;ons. The Interpreter broke Silence and &s;aid, that he brought a hundred Rubles, to give me as a Pre&s;ent from her Maje&s;ty. I an&s;wered, that I &s;hould receive them with a profound Re&s;pect, and that he need only lay them on the Table. This he refu&s;ed to do, under Pretence, that I mu&s;t fir&s;t count them. To this, I replied, that it would not become me to be &s;o &s;crupulous in what I received as a free Gift: But he having renewed his In&s;tances, and told me, that he mu&s;t have a Receipt, I no longer he&s;itated at doing what he de&s;ired. He then gave me the Key of my Trunk, which I opened in his Pre&s;ence, &s;hewing him, that there were a Sword and two Pi&s;tols. I would gladly have pre|vailed on him to di&s;charge my Guard, but he gave me to under&s;tand, that he could not take &s;o much upon him&s;elf, having received no Orders for that Purpo&s;e. He then a&s;ked me, what Route I in|tended
<PB N="175" REF="408">
to take, when I departed, and whether I cho&s;e to go to <HI>Dantzick,</HI> or <HI>Lubeck.</HI> I an&s;wered, that my De&s;ign was not to repair to either of tho&s;e Cities, and that I &s;hould chu&s;e to travel by Land, not by Sea. He told me, that I would not be permitted to go by Land, and that Orders had al|ready been given for my imbarking.</P>
<P>This Procedure appeared very &s;ingular, and even extravagant; upon which I told my Interpreter, that I would write two or three Words, to beg, that this Order might be countermanded. He told me, that he could not take any Writing from my Hands. I de&s;ire then, &s;aid I, you would tell tho&s;e who &s;ent you, that I little value my Liberty, if it cannot be granted me, but on Condition of my go|ing to Sea, in the infirm State of Health I am re|duced to, and in &s;o advanced a Sea&s;on, that my Life would be endangered by &s;uch a Voyage, which I could never believe to be her Maje&s;ty's Intention. Whil&s;t I was thus di&s;cour&s;ing with him, he took Occa&s;ion to a&s;k, what induced me to re|fu&s;e a Po&s;t in the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army. I perceived by the Manner, wherein he a&s;ked this Que&s;tion, that it was only to pump me, I, therefore, gave him no other Reply, than that I did not de&s;ire any Em|ployment, and that my Sickne&s;s had rendered me incapable of Service. This la&s;t Que&s;tion gave me very great Unea&s;ine&s;s, for I &s;hould have been ve|ry &s;orry, to be obliged to remain in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> But thus our Conver&s;ation ended.</P>
<P>In this Manner I was &s;et at Liberty, as they called it, though I was &s;till accompanied by my Guard, of whom one had always his Sword drawn. My Steward came &s;oon after the Interpreter was gone, and told me, that I mu&s;t no longer expect to be dieted as I had been, but mu&s;t provide my &s;elf with all Nece&s;&s;aries. I was, at fir&s;t, concerned at this News, but, when I con&s;idered, that Mr.
<PB N="176" REF="409">
<HI>De L'I&s;le</HI> and his Lady would not fail to continue their kind A&s;&s;i&s;tances, I re&s;olved to acquaint them with all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and beg they would fa|vour me with a Vi&s;it. My Steward, who under|took to carry this Me&s;&s;age him&s;elf, apprized them of my De&s;ire, and they &s;oon came to &s;ee me. <Q><L>O qui complexus &amp; gaudia quanta fuere.</L></Q>
This Interview made me forget all I had &s;uffered in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> I then recollected all the Tokens of Friend&s;hip I had received from tho&s;e generous Per|&s;ons, in order to expre&s;s my grateful Acknow|ledgments. I was &s;o touched with a Sen&s;e of their Benefactions, that I could not forbear &s;hedding &s;ome Tears. They both an&s;wered the Prote&s;tations I made, in Terms, which &s;till augmented my Ten|derne&s;s. After the fir&s;t Tran&s;ports of Joy, which Hearts &s;u&s;ceptible of a real Friend&s;hip always feel on the like Occa&s;ions, Mrs. <HI>De L'I&s;le</HI> was thought|ful of giving me fre&s;h Marks of her Benevolence. As &s;he knew, that I was on the Point of undertaking a long and fatiguing Journey, &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee the few Cloaths they had left me, and having found my Linnen in a frightful Condition, &s;he &s;ent the great|e&s;t Part of it to her Hou&s;e to be mended, that it might &s;erve me during my Journey. Could Friend|&s;hip be carried to a greater Height? But what far|ther Kindne&s;s did not &s;he &s;hew me, even till the ve|ry Moment of my Departure! She paid me many charitable Vi&s;its, provided me with Diet, and all other Nece&s;&s;aries, and in &s;hort, omitted Nothing, wherein &s;he could be in the lea&s;t &s;erviceable to me. Having been informed, that I eagerly wi&s;hed, to know what had pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Europe</HI> during my Pilgri|mage and Captivity, to &s;atisfy my Curio&s;ity on that Head, &s;he found Means of conveying to me all the News-Papers. The Service &s;he did me, on
<PB N="177" REF="410">
that Occa&s;ion, was one of tho&s;e, of which I was mo&s;t truly &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t Vi&s;it was pretty long, and they came the very next Day again, accompanied by Mr. <HI>Du Vernoi.</HI> I told this Gentleman, that I did not, in the lea&s;t, doubt but he would have continued to vi&s;it me, had he not been forbid, and that I thought my &s;elf never the le&s;s oblig'd to him. They &s;pent great Part of that Day in my Chamber, and no|thing could be a greater Satisfaction to me, than an Opportunity of conver&s;ing with &s;o agreeable Company, after having been, during the Space of more than a Year, as it were deaf and dumb. I might then very ju&s;tly &s;ay: <HI>Verba intermi&s;&s;a re|tento.</HI> Not a Day pa&s;&s;ed but they vi&s;ited me, and e&s;pecially Mrs. <HI>De L'I&s;le,</HI> who gave me each Time &s;ome new Marks of her Benevolence.</P>
<P>Nothing hindered the Completion of my Hap|pine&s;s, but the Re&s;olution that had been anew taken, to oblige me to go away by Sea. The Weather happened luckily for me to be very fro&s;ty at the Time of my intended Departure, in&s;omuch, that tho&s;e who had already laid out my Way, were obliged to change their fir&s;t De&s;ign, and to grant what I had &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired. The River was in a few Days frozen up, and the Way to <HI>Croon|&s;tad,</HI> which I was to have taken, was no longer practicable. Providence &s;eemed de&s;ignedly to fru&s;trate all the wicked De&s;igns of my Enemies, and to perform continual Miracles in my Behalf. <HI>Nemo tam pater qu&agrave;m Deus.</HI></P>
<P>Plea&s;ed with the Change, which had happened, I thought of nothing more than making the nece&s;|&s;ary Preparations for my Departure. I only feared, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> would find &s;ome Pretence or other for laying fre&s;h Ob&s;tacles in my Way. They had deceived me &s;o often, that I could no longer de|pend on their Word. And, indeed, though it
<PB N="178" REF="411">
had already been declared to me, in her Maje&s;ty's Name, that I was at Liberty, and that, to defray the Expence of my Journey, the Sum of 100 Ru|bles had been given me, I was &s;till confined in my Pri&s;on, and continued to be under the In&s;pection of a Guard, who watched all my Steps. I could not, I confe&s;s, conceive the Cau&s;e of this Proceed|ing: I was told, on the one Hand, that I was en|tirely relea&s;ed, and my Guard, on the other Side, received &s;trict Orders, not to let me go out of their Sight. I looked upon the Liberty they had given me to make u&s;e of my Sword and Pi&s;tols, as a Snare, laid for me, to draw me into &s;ome Quar|rel, that they might have a fre&s;h Pretence, to de|tain me in Pri&s;on. They &s;ent, be&s;ides, many People into my Pri&s;on, and e&s;pecially my late Stew|ard, to per&s;uade me to enter into Service in the <HI>Czarina</HI>'s Troops. The&s;e Per&s;ons I looked upon as &s;o many Spies, whom I had Rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t. However, not to provoke their Rage, I alledged the &s;ame Excu&s;es, which I had before made to the Interpreter, without expre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t Di&s;content at the U&s;age I had received. They thought, per|haps, that, &s;ince I came into <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> with a View of procuring &s;ome Po&s;t in the Army, I &s;hould not refu&s;e to accept of an advantageous Offer. But the&s;e Gentlemen were gro&s;sly mi&s;taken, I &s;hould rather have cho&s;en to &s;pend the Re&s;idue of my Days in a De&s;art, than to live among them. This may perhaps be the Effect of Prejudice, but I look up|on <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> as a Place of Bani&s;hment, where &s;ome few Foreigners are the only &s;ociable Creatures, that are to be met with.</P>
<P>Such was the Situation of my Affairs, when Mr. <HI>De L'I&s;le</HI> and his Wife, who &s;till continued to vi|&s;it me, invited me to dine with them, and &s;pend a Day at their Hou&s;e. They probably knew, that Favour would not be denied me, and that I &s;hould
<PB N="179" REF="412">
obtain it without any Difficulty. I therefore made the Reque&s;t, and found it immediately complied with. My former Steward, with &s;everal others, were ordered, the fir&s;t Day of my going abroad, narrowly to watch my Steps. Ju&s;t before I went out of my Pri&s;on, I told him, that I hoped I might now have a Barber, and not be at the Trouble of &s;having my &s;elf. To this he replied, that he knew not whether I could be allow'd one, but that he would go and enquire. At his Return, he told me, I might be &s;haved, but mu&s;t leave my Sword in my Chamber. I obeyed, and went to Mr. <HI>De L'I&s;le</HI>'s, where I had the Plea&s;ure of &s;pending the re&s;t of the Day.</P>
<P>I cannot expre&s;s the Joy, with which I was re|ceived in that Hou&s;e, where even the Servants en|deavoured to outvie each other in rendring me their Services. I had, that Day, no Cau&s;e to com|plain of the Behaviour of my Guard, but they af|terwards carried their In&s;olence to &s;uch an Exce&s;s, that I re&s;olved to go out no more. At the &s;ame Time, I acquainted the Mini&s;ters with all that had pa&s;&s;ed, declaring, that I cho&s;e rather to continue in my Pri&s;on, than to be thus expo&s;ed to the abu|&s;ive Treatment of my Guard, who had not the lea&s;t Regard for me, and behaved as di&s;re&s;pectfully to the Per&s;ons, to who&s;e Hou&s;es I was invited. As I received no An&s;wer, I cho&s;e to remain quietly in my Chamber, 'till I could obtain Leave to go abroad alone. Orders were a few Days after given to my Guard to &s;heath their Swords, and to with|draw into my Anti-Chamber. This was the fir&s;t Time, during a whole Year, that I had been alone, without any one to in&s;pect my Actions. It is &s;ome|what uncommon, that a Per&s;on, confined to a nar|row Pri&s;on, &s;hould &s;o ardently wi&s;h to be deprived of all Company: But this was, neverthele&s;s, my Ca&s;e; for an entire Solitude was to me much more agree|able,
<PB N="180" REF="413">
than to be always infe&s;ted with the Company of tho&s;e Animals.</P>
<P>All nece&s;&s;ary Preparations were, in the mean Time, made for my Journey, and nothing farther was wanting for my Departure, but the Pa&s;&s;es they had promi&s;ed me. Some Papers, which I had been robbed of at <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> were &s;till in the Hands of the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> But they were not &s;o very momen|tous, as to give me any Unea&s;ine&s;s. I had already, for &s;everal Days, made pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances for Leave to depart, but having met with no An&s;wer, I wrote a &s;hort Memorial, wherein <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I remon&s;trated to tho&s;e Gentlemen, that a longer Stay would put me to greater Expences, and that I &s;hould be thereby reduced to a Want of Money for my Journey. I likewi&s;e begged, that they would procure me Pa&s;&s;es from the Mini&s;ters of tho&s;e Princes, through who&s;e Dominions I was to pa&s;s, in Order to return to <HI>Italy.</HI> I de&s;ired, in the la&s;t Place, that they would re&s;tore my Pa|pers, and, if they thought, that the &s;hort Journal from <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> to <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> contained any Thing my&s;terious, they were welcome to keep it. I &s;aid the &s;ame with Regard to another Paper, in which I had made &s;everal Ob&s;ervations on the <HI>Wolga,</HI> and told them, that they were extracted from <HI>Olearius.</HI>"</Q> After I had fini&s;hed this Me|morial, I would have given it to an Interpreter, who came for a fre&s;h Receipt for the 100 Rubles, which the <HI>Czarina</HI> had pre&s;ented me with. But he refu&s;ed to receive it, and I was obliged to tell him the Contents of it. I was too well acquainted with the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> to be in the lea&s;t &s;urprized at this Procedure, I ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed at the Inducements they had not to hear me. Give me Leave to acquaint you with this whole Affair, which is of no great Honour to the&s;e Gentlemen.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="414">
You may remember, I told you before, that I had been robbed of Part of tho&s;e Cloaths and Ef|fects, which were locked up in my Trunk. In or|der therefore, to prevent my coming to any Ex|po&s;tulation on that Head, they thought proper to forbid every Body to receive any Repre&s;entation or Writing from my Hands. They &s;uppo&s;ed, with|out Doubt, that the Sum given me, was more than &s;ufficient to make good the Lo&s;s I had &s;u&s;tained, by what had been taken from me. But they were &s;trangely mi&s;taken, for the Damage was very con|&s;iderable. This, Sir, was the only Motive, that induced them not to give Ear to me, and to re|fu&s;e the Acceptance of any Papers I might offer. Such is the Treatment, a Stranger is to expect in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> where it is a very difficult Matter to pro|cure Ju&s;tice. But I was their Pa&s;time, on many other Occa&s;ions, and I may truly &s;ay, that I was their Victim, from the fir&s;t Hour of my Captivi|ty, till the Moment of my Departure. Be&s;ides the many In&s;tances I have given you of this, I beg leave to mention one more.</P>
<P>More than a Month had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince it had been &s;ignified to me, that I was at Liberty, and yet Icould not be permitted to quit the Country. This Slow|ne&s;s of proceeding made me very unea&s;y, and gave me &s;ome Su&s;picions. I feared a Propo&s;al of &s;taying in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and was not ignorant of the Danger that would attend a Refu&s;al of an Offer in their Troops.</P>
<P>On the 22d of <HI>November,</HI> it was at la&s;t told me, I might &s;et out directly. This Me&s;&s;age was brought me by my former Steward, who at the &s;ame Time a&s;ked me how many Hor&s;es I would have. I told him, that I &s;hould have Occa&s;ion for four, but was re&s;olved not to go, till I had received my Writings, and the nece&s;&s;ary Pa&s;&s;es. An Interpre|ter came, the next Day, to bring me 50 Rubles,
<PB N="182" REF="415">
which he had been ordered to give me, and a&s;&s;u|red me, that the following Day was fixed upon for my Departure. I an&s;wered, that the Sum, which the <HI>Czarina</HI> had already been pleas'd to &s;end me, was &s;ufficient to defray the Expence of my Jour|ney, but when he replied, that he offered me this farther Sum by Her Maje&s;ty's Order, I could not but accept of it, with Deference, and give him a Receipt for it. I had too great a Veneration for the Name of the <HI>Czarina,</HI> not to receive mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ively whatever could be offered me by her Orders; otherwi&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hould have flatly refus'd this Money, as I was not de&s;titute of wherewithal to &s;upply all my Wants.</P>
<P>As I no longer doubted of going the next Day, after the A&s;&s;urances I had ju&s;t before received, I gave immediate Notice thereof to Mr. <HI>De L 'I&s;le,</HI> and his Spou&s;e, who came directly with Mr. <HI>Du Vernoi,</HI> to &s;pend the Day with me. Though I had now Rea&s;on to think my &s;elf at the Height of my Wi&s;hes, yet my parting from them very much af|fected me. The Regret with which I left Mr. <HI>De L'I&s;le</HI> and his Spou&s;e, was the greater, as I had no Hopes of ever &s;eeing them again, nor of giving them any Tokens of my Friend&s;hip and Acknow|ledgement. Mrs. <HI>De L'I&s;le,</HI> not &s;atisfied with the Favours &s;he had till then be&s;towed on me, would again furni&s;h me with a large Quantity of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Every Thing was ready for my Departure, the next Day, which was the 24th, when a Me&s;&s;enger came and told me, that I mu&s;t &s;till wait till the 26th, which was to be the Day of my entire Deli|verance. My Papers were &s;ent me at Ten in the Morning, but they retained Part of them, with the Journal, I mentioned above. I was then a&s;ked, when I intended to &s;et out, and, having an&s;wered, the &s;ooner the better, they &s;aid they would go and fetch the Hor&s;es. As for the Pa&s;&s;es which I had
<PB N="183" REF="416">
&s;o often demanded, they promi&s;ed indeed, that I &s;hould have them, but never performed their Pro|mi&s;e. Was not this an In&s;tance of crying Inju&s;tice, thus to oblige a Man to travel without a Pa&s;s, in the Situation which the Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> were then in? Their being them&s;elves &s;o &s;crupulous on that Head, makes me the more a&s;toni&s;hed at it, for if a Stranger happens unfortunately to come into their Country, without being provided with one, he is &s;ure to be expo&s;ed to Slavery for &s;everal Years. The only Pa&s;s I could obtain was in the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Language, and you &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee, what Terms it was conceived in. But I mu&s;t leave this Subject, and proceed to an Account of my Journey.</P>
<P>I &s;et out from <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> at four o' Clock, in a Sled, and took the Road for <HI>Narva,</HI> from whence having continued my Journey, with Speed and Suc|ce&s;s, I arrived at <HI>Riga,</HI> on the third of <HI>December,</HI> in the Afternoon. The Per&s;on who had been ap|pointed my Guide, carried me to the Hou&s;e of General <HI>Felker&s;ham.</HI> That Gentleman gave me a very kind Reception, and treated me in a Manner, that &s;hewed the Difference between a <HI>German</HI> and a <HI>Mu&s;covite.</HI> After the fir&s;t Compliment, he told me, that I need only appoint the Time, when I intended to continue my Journey, and he would give the nece&s;&s;ary Orders. I replied, that I was en|tirely dependant on his Plea&s;ure, but &s;ince he was &s;o kind as to give me my Choice, I begged he would let me depart as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. He an|&s;wered in the mo&s;t obliging Terms, that I might go in&s;tantly, if I pleas'd, but that he hoped, I would, at lea&s;t, honour him with my Company that Night. I &s;ignified to him, that I was not in a Condition to accept &s;o kind an Offer, and being very weary, begged he would permit me to look out for a Lodging, that I might immediately go to Re&s;t. After having renewed his Intreaties,
<PB N="184" REF="417">
he &s;uffered me to go, and by his Order I was lodg'd in a Hou&s;e near his, where he &s;ent me a very ele|gant Supper. Every Thing was prepared for my Departure the next Morning. As I had no Time to lo&s;e, I repaired immediately to the General, to take my Leave of him, and to expre&s;s my mo&s;t grateful Acknowledgments. He introduced me in|to his Lady's Apartment, to drink a Di&s;h of Tea. I there found two very beautiful and accompli&s;hed Ladies, which made me not a little a&s;hamed, to appear in their Pre&s;ence, in a Dre&s;s little better than that of a Savage. After having breakfa&s;ted, I I retired, very well &s;atisfied with the Reception I had met with.</P>
<P>I then &s;et out with a Secretary, a well-bred Man, who had Orders to accompany me as far as the Confines of <HI>Livonia.</HI> So great a Thaw had hap|pened, that in cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Dwina,</HI> I found the Wa|ter a Foot deep above the Ice, in&s;omuch that I tra|velled that Day more by Water, than by Land. I lay by that Night, and when I was about to de|part, the next Morning, Mr. Secretary, in a very polite Manner, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, and paid me a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Compliment, which he had proba|bly been charged with. He delivered to me a <HI>German</HI> Pa&s;s, and told me, that, by Her Maje&s;ty's Order, he gave me Notice, I was now entirely at Liberty, but that I was forbid ever to &s;et Foot in the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Dominions again. At fir&s;t, this Compliment greatly enraged me, but I had a &s;uffi|cient Command over my Pa&s;&s;ion, to moderate it, and not to give him the An&s;wer it de&s;erved. I only told him, that they had Room to think &s;uch a Prohibition needle&s;s, but &s;ince it had been thought nece&s;&s;ary, he might a&s;&s;ure his Ma&s;ters, that the <HI>Czarina</HI>'s Orders &s;hould be punctually ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>What think you, Sir, of this la&s;t Step? Was this a Compliment to make to a Man, whom they
<PB N="185" REF="418">
had found as innocent as a Lamb? I ought to have informed tho&s;e Gentlemen, that, if it &s;hould ever be my Fate to come into their Country again, it &s;hould be in &s;o good Company, that they would find it a little more difficult to &s;eize my Sword, than at my Arrival at <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> and that I never in|tended to appear again in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> unle&s;s it was with Fire and Sword. But am I not to blame, to wi&s;h them Harm? Was it not a great Favour to permit me thus to go out of their Country, and did I not quit it at an ea&s;y Rate, after having been in Danger of being &s;hut up and buried there for Life? For, by the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Politicks, a Man is to be irretrieveably undone, after they have proceeded &s;o far, as to abu&s;e him, as they had done me, with|out a ju&s;t Pretence; unle&s;s they would endeavour to detain him by &s;uch kind Treatment as might make him forget all that is pa&s;t. They have therefore not u&s;ed me with that Rigour, which is pre&s;cribed by their Politicks, and I ought con&s;equently to ac|knowledge my &s;elf obliged to them. I am not le&s;s beholden to them for &s;uffering me to depart: For the Life, I could have led in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> I &s;hould have e&s;teemed as a continual Death. They proba|bly thought, that an <HI>Italian</HI> could never pardon them for the bad U&s;age he had received from their Hands, and, following the Maxims of a &s;alutary Policy, they cho&s;e rather to have an Enemy with|out Doors, than in their own Country. They judged it perhaps likewi&s;e improper, to detain a Man, who would not be governed by their Plea|&s;ure, though a Slave, and who might &s;ome Time or other find Acce&s;s to a Per&s;on, from whom they carefully conceal tho&s;e Things, which &s;he ought to be be&s;t acquainted with. To all the&s;e Motives may be added, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are already burthened with many Strangers, whom they mortally hate, and that they are very unwilling to &s;ee any more &s;ettled
<PB N="186" REF="419">
among them. But be that as it will, I am re&s;olv|ed to forget them, and to abandon them to their own Remor&s;e; if they are capable of having any.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hould conclude my Letter, and the Re|cital of my Adventures; for, &s;ince the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> will not be farther mentioned, you mu&s;t not expect to hear any Thing extraordinary, or that may ex|cite your Curio&s;ity. But, <HI>Re&s;tabat Fatis aliquid,</HI> of which I mu&s;t give you an Account.</P>
<P>After having left my Secretary, I proceeded to <HI>Mittau,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Courland,</HI> where I was oblig|ed to &s;top. As I found it impo&s;&s;ible to travel any farther in a Sled, becau&s;e of the Thaw, I was nece&s;&s;itated there to hire a Wheel-carriage. I got one made after the Manner of the Country, to car|ry me as far as <HI>Memmel,</HI> the fir&s;t City in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia.</HI> In this Journey I met with diver&s;e Adventures. The fir&s;t of the&s;e appears &s;omewhat Romantick, but is neverthele&s;s very true. Being arrived, the fir&s;t Day, towards the Evening, at an Inn, which was the only one, in a va&s;t Fore&s;t, I was going in|&s;tantly to Bed, without my Supper, the Hou&s;e not affording any Thing. No &s;ooner was I gone into my Chamber, than I heard a great Noi&s;e at the Door of the Hou&s;e, and fancied I heard &s;ome|body &s;peak <HI>French.</HI> I went out immediately, and having a&s;ked whether I had not heard <HI>French</HI> &s;po|ken, I was an&s;wered in the Affirmative. I then addre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf to the&s;e Strangers, &s;aying, Come in, Gentlemen, this indeed is a very bad Inn, you will find nothing to eat here, but you will meet with a Per&s;on, who will be very glad of your Company. I &s;aw, at the &s;ame Time, a Man of a graceful A&s;pect entring, but as he had a large Cap on, I could not well di&s;tingui&s;h his Face. When we paid each other our mutual Compliments of Ci|vility, I thought I heard a Voice, well known to me, and mine had the &s;ame Effect on him. Af|ter
<PB N="187" REF="420">
having view'd each other attentively, we both recollected our &s;elves, and embraced one another, not without being &s;truck with Surprize, at meeting in this Place. This Accident &s;eemed to give him &s;ome Di&s;quiet, for he had &s;trong Rea&s;ons, not to di&s;cover him&s;elf to any Body. He begged I would entirely forget his Name, after which we di&s;cour&s;|ed together, and had many Subjects to entertain each other upon.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him &s;everal Que&s;tions very pre&s;&s;ingly, and he &s;atisfied my Curio&s;ity in many Points. He happened, fortunately for me, to have &s;ome good Provi&s;ions, which furni&s;hed us a comfortable Sup|per, and then we went to Re&s;t. As he came from the &s;ame Country, which I had ju&s;t before left, and intended to go the &s;ame Way, which I took, we &s;et out together the next Morning, and put up at the &s;ame Inn at Night. When I, however, per|ceived, that he could not recover from his fir&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s, and found, be&s;ides, I was a Burden to him, I re&s;olved to wi&s;h him a good Journey, and parted with him the more willingly, as my Hor|&s;es, being not &s;o good as his, could hardly keep Pace with him.</P>
<P>You expect perhaps &s;ome farther Account of this Adventure, but I am tied down to Silence, and will perform the Promi&s;e I made of inviolable Se|crecy; which, if I &s;hould not, I mu&s;t unavoidably inform you of certain Matters, which are &s;till of too great Importance. An Adventure very diffe|rent from this, will be better worth your Notice, by which you may &s;ee, what a Man mu&s;t expect, who has once begun to be unfortunate.</P>
<P>The tenth Day a general Thaw en&s;ued, and the Roads were extreamly bad. Having met with Places, that appeared very dangerous, I &s;ent my Po&s;tilion to &s;ound them, and he found that they could not be pa&s;&s;ed with Safety. We went a great
<PB N="188" REF="421">
way about in Search of another Pa&s;&s;age. My Guide, who thought he had found a good one, led me into a kind of Pit, the only one, perhaps, in the whole Country, in which we were almo&s;t bu|ried, with our Hor&s;es and Carriage. It was not without great Difficulty we got out, and it was a &s;ingular good Fortune, that we did not lo&s;e our Lives by this Accident. To &s;uffer Shipwreck by Sea, to be ca&s;t away in a Lake, or in a River, are Things common: Accidents of that Kind hap|pen daily: But to meet with that Misfortune by Land, in the mid&s;t of arable Ground, this can ne|ver happen to any one, but him, who <HI>Minxit in patrios cineres.</HI></P>
<P>In this Condition, I was obliged to travel, four or five Hours-Journey, before we came to an Inn. That we came to was tolerably good, and I was obliged to &s;tay there three Days to clean&s;e my &s;elf. My Goods were all entirely &s;poiled, and e&s;pecially my Writings, which I regretted more than all the re&s;t. I arrived, however, the 15th at <HI>Memmel,</HI> where I was obliged to take a Sled to go to <HI>Konig&s;|burg.</HI> There could not po&s;&s;ibly be a wor&s;e Way than this proved. The Ice was in many Places cracked, and &s;ometimes &s;o covered with Water, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to get forwards. I never, in my Life, had &s;o painful and fatiguing a Journey; and I cannot better compare the Danger I was in, than to that of being obliged to &s;tand one's Ground, again&s;t a Battery of well-placed Cannon. Never|thele&s;s, the &s;ame Supreme Being, who, for &s;ome Time, had only laid a heavy Burden upon me with one Hand, to relieve me with the other, conducted me &s;afe to <HI>Konig&s;burg,</HI> the la&s;t Day of the Year 1734.</P>
<P>When I came into the City, I found I was a Spectacle to every Body; for I pretty much re&s;em|bled either the Prodigal Son, or &s;ome Fugitive Slave. I was carried before General <HI>Cat,</HI> who
<PB N="189" REF="422">
doubtle&s;s perceived the Confu&s;ion I was in, to ap|pear before him, in that Equipage, and, therefore, was &s;o good to di&s;patch me immediately. I took my Lodging in the fir&s;t Inn I came at, and, at my Entrance into it, offered up my Prayers to Heaven, to vouch&s;afe me &s;ome Re&s;t from my La|bour.<Q><L>Contenti no&s;tris, Di, precor, e&s;to, malis.</L></Q></P>
<P>Being arrived at <HI>Konig&s;burg,</HI> I thought it was now out of the Power of the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> to give me any new Unea&s;ine&s;s: But I found my &s;elf mi&s;taken, and met with a fre&s;h In&s;tance of their Malice and Ba&s;ene&s;s. The Ca&s;e was this. I have already told you, that at my Departure from <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> I required &s;everal Pa&s;&s;es, which were refu&s;ed me, and that they only gave me one in the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Tongue. At <HI>Riga,</HI> they gave me another in <HI>Ger|man,</HI> of which I under&s;tood as little as of the former. When I came before General <HI>Cat,</HI> at <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> I &s;hewed him the&s;e Pa&s;&s;es; and notwith&s;tanding the powerful Rea&s;ons which might have induced him to make me pa&s;s a &s;trict Examination, he took no Notice of the Pa&s;&s;es, but gave me Leave to go and repo&s;e my &s;elf.</P>
<P>The next Morning, I gave them to my Land|lord, who had Orders to demand them from me, and to examine them. What he did with them, I know not; but when he returned them, he a&s;ked me if I knew their Contents; upon which, telling him, I was wholly ignorant thereof, he promi&s;ed to get them tran&s;lated for me. He &s;oon returned with the Tran&s;lations; but how great was my Surprize, when ca&s;ting an Eye upon them, I found, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> not contented with having forbid me, by the Mouth of their Secretary, ever to &s;et-Foot into their Dominions again, had even in&s;erted the &s;ame Compliment in their Pa&s;&s;es. Tho' a long Cap|tivity,
<PB N="190" REF="423">
and other ill U&s;age I had already met with, in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> had accu&s;tomed me to bear every Thing patiently, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to put up quietly with this. I had Rea&s;on to fear, that General <HI>Cat,</HI> after having &s;een the Contents of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;es, might take me for a Per&s;on who had been guilty of &s;ome enormous Crime in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and had been &s;hamefully bani&s;hed for it. This lay the heavier upon me, as I was very much tired, and withal, in Want of Money, and, therefore, un|der a Nece&s;&s;ity of making &s;ome Stay at <HI>Konig&s;burg.</HI> All my Thoughts were taken up with this prepo&s;|terous Event, which &s;truck at my Reputation. From this Moment I forgot all the other Evils I had &s;uffered, the Dangers I had been expo&s;ed to, the Captivity I had undergone, the Indignities which had been offered me; nay, the very Pri&s;on it &s;elf, which had brought me to the Brink of the Grave; all this, I &s;ay, was as nothing to me, in Compari&s;on with the melancholly State I was now reduced to. I want Terms to expre&s;s the Vilene&s;s of this Action.</P>
<P>With this extraordinary <HI>Cata&s;trophe,</HI> I &s;hall fi|ni&s;h the Narrative of my Adventures. The Com|pliance which is due to the great Intimacy and Friend&s;hip that is between us, has engaged me in it: But for a fuller Account of them, I mu&s;t re&s;erve it till I have the Happine&s;s of embracing you. I am now, Dear Sir, ju&s;t upon my Departure to be with you, &s;ince you invite, and &s;o earne&s;tly pre&s;s me to it.
