<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IN this little</HI> Collection <HI>of</HI> POEMS, all <HI>those signed</HI> ANNA MATILDA, <HI>except the</HI> REPLY <HI>to</HI> REUBEN, <HI>have been before the Public. Desirous to have her name united with that of</HI> DELLA CRUSCA<HI>'s, longer than the fleeting fame of News|papers allows,</HI> ANNA MATILDA <HI>had begun to recall some fugitive trifles, in order to form them into a volume&mdash;when she saw the Poetry of</HI> DELLA CRUSCA, <HI>&amp;c. advertised by</HI> Mr. Bell. <HI>This did not induce her to change her</HI> design, <HI>only the</HI> mode <HI>of it; and still wishing to be united with her favourite bard in a distinct publication, she offered his publisher her Poems, on condition of their being form'd into a volume, similar to his&mdash;the offer was accepted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Not having, however, Poetry enough to form such a volume, she was persuaded to enrich it with some curious</HI> PROSE<HI>&mdash;written</HI> "in other times." <HI>The Fragment subjoined to the Poems, is from the</HI> autograph <HI>of the famous</HI> Sir William Waller; <HI>an important Actor in the busy drama of the last</HI>
<PB REF="4">
<HI>century. The manuscript has been preserved in a family to which its Editor is allied, and who are pleased at an opportunity of making their treasure public; how then can</HI> ANNA MATILDA <HI>fear for her</HI> poetic existence, <HI>when it is protected on the one hand by the best Lyric of the</HI> present age, <HI>and on the other by one of the most pious men, and greatest Warriors of the last?</HI></P>

<HEAD>WRITTEN THE MORNING AFTER <HI>ANNA MATILDA</HI>'s RETURN FROM A FRIEND's HOUSE,</HEAD>
<HEAD>Close on the verge of <HI>WINDSOR FOREST.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HAVE I then left you, sweet Hygeian bowers&mdash;</L>
<L>Oh! have I left you <HI>friendship's holy hours?</HI></L>
<L>Why are ye vanish'd, dear inviting shades?</L>
<L>Why ceas'd, the cheering music of your glades?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not <HI>that</HI> which on the surging aether floats,</L>
<L>Or trembles in the linnet's gurgling notes;&mdash;</L>
<L>But that which gives you <HI>Harriet</HI>'s polish'd mind,</L>
<L>Her sense reflective, and her taste refin'd;</L>
<L><HI>That,</HI> which your venerable Dryads love,</L>
<L>When midst their haunts they see her graceful move;</L>
<L><HI>That</HI> which adorns the clearest, strongest sense,</L>
<L>And clothes in lightest dress, the thought intense.</L>

<L>Or from the Arctic, higher fly</L>
<L>Thro' the chill Norwegian sky&mdash;</L>
<L><HI>Turn not</HI> to Gallia's sunny vales,</L>
<L>Nor mix with yours Italia's gales,</L>
<L>Strait o'er the northern ocean sweep,</L>
<L>Where pearls the frozen Na&iuml;ads weep;</L>
<L>But on high Grampia's fleecy top,</L>
<L>Where kids, the gelid herbage crop,</L>

<L>Fresh from its chilly caverns spring.</L>

<L>Thro' some time-fretted cavern fly.</L>

<P>[In the following Correspondence, which has occasioned much notice, it has been suggested that there has been some collusion;&mdash;ANNA MATILDA, therefore, declares that tho' she has lately guessed at DELLA CRUSCA, she is yet uncertain as to his name and rank, and she is persuaded that he cannot have the most dis tantidea of her's.</P>
<P>The beautiful lines of the ADIEU AND RECALL struck her so forcibly, that without rising from the table at which she read, she answered them. DELLA CRUSCA's elegant Reply surprised her into another, and thus the Cor|respondence most unexpectedly became settled, ANNA MATILDA's share in it has little to boast; but she has one claim of which she is proud&mdash;That of having been the first to point out the excellence of Della Crusca; if there can be merit in discerning what is so very obvious.]</P>

<HEAD>ANNA MATILDA,</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO THOSE WHO READ.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE following little Tract, printed care|fully from the Manuscript of the once famous</HI> Sir William Waller, <HI>is considered as a curiosity wor|thy of being given to the public:&mdash;It contains the</HI> memoranda <HI>and</HI> reflections <HI>of a man who had a considerable share in forming the fate of England, at a time when the strong convulsions of its state arrested the attention of Europe, and of the world.</HI></P>
<P>Sir William Waller <HI>was a member of the House of Commons, and Major-General of the Parliament army. It appears from</HI> WHITLOCK, <HI>that he was a man of great consideration in the army, and with the public.</HI> Oliver Cromwell <HI>served under him&mdash;the</HI> KING <HI>feared him&mdash;the</HI> PARLIAMENT <HI>depended on him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="102"><HI>The purity of his intentions, and the uprightnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his principles&mdash;the transcript before you wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> sufficiently establish;&mdash;it is a</HI> mental mirror, <HI>in which you behold the features of the writer's mind, as distinctly as a looking glass reflects, to a young beauty, her cheek of roses, and her eye of fire&punc; That he was popular as to courage and resolution, is plain from a formal petition sent to Parliament by the inhabitants of Portsmouth, praying that</HI> Sir William Waller <HI>might be made their Governor.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That he had a mind capable of the tenderest im|pressions, and alive to all the charms of love, ap|pears, from this, that he never lived unmarried. Three times he exulted in the flowery hymeneal chain; and speaks of each Lady with exalted fond|ness and affection. But those, alas! were days in which the</HI> connubial passion <HI>was the only one to|lerated!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of</HI> WALLER, Hume <HI>begins to speak in the fol|lowing words:&mdash;</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>In the year</HI> 1643, Sir William Waller <HI>began to distinguish himself among the Generals of the army. Active, and inde&s;ati|gable; in his operations rapid and enterprising; he was fitted by his genius to the nature of war.</HI>"</Q> Vol. VI. p. 516.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="103"><HI>It has been lately so much the taste to read the ana of celebrated men, that the Editor of</HI> these <HI>is persuaded, their being combined with the effusions of her own idle hours, will not render them unwel|come. To the public, perhaps, there is no occasion for apology, but towards the writer himself, she has some consciousness of delinquency. The brave General, who wore himself out in campaigns, cased in armour, and peeping half his life through an iron vizor, thought of nothing</HI> less, <HI>probably, than of turning author;&mdash;yet it happens, that after he has been at rest with his tumultuous ancestors (I hope they will forgive my guessing at their characters) almost a century, and his military and moral cha|racter long ago decided on, he is now made to hold up his hand at the literary bar, to be tried by his Critics, and his Country.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To his critics and countrymen, it may be observed, that if they have an appetite for anecdote, the fol|lowing pages will not tend much to satisfy it. They are filled with the recollections of a man, who, at the close of a busy life, thought it</HI> time <HI>to recollect himself, and who recollects</HI> only <HI>about himself. In the retrospect, his imminent dangers, and hair|breadth 'scapes, light up his gratitude to Heaven, and make his little book rather a compendium of piety, than a register of events. A piety not much</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="104">
<HI>differing from that which has provoked our sneers at the posthumous works of the great</HI> Johnson;<HI>&mdash;but then,</HI> he <HI>was a scholar, and a philosopher, and his piety, in course, very much unlike other people's. What you are now offer'd, is the piety of a Gene|ral&mdash;we have many Generals, and they can an|swer for the similitude.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In a word&mdash;this peculiar little volume is pre|sented not to the world as an amusement, but to the</HI> curious <HI>as a</HI> medal. <HI>A medal struck at an era when the events of this country were</HI> MIGHTY, <HI>and when the characters of men were</HI> GRAND: <HI>when every action was on an enlarged scale, and in high relief;&mdash;when the kingdom, like Sir Joshua's infant Hercules, was struggling between the two deadly serpents which assailed its vitality&mdash;the</HI> TY|RANNY OF THE COMMONWEALTH, <HI>and the</HI> PRE|ROGATIVE OF THE CROWN.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> internal evidence <HI>the book carries with it is so strong, that it is judged not necessary to say one word on its authenticity. But it is necessary to say, that besides the pages suppressed (mentioned in the conclusion), there has been an elision of one entire section, under the head</HI> OF PERILS BY WATER; <HI>a part likewise of that under the head</HI> BY GREAT SICKNESSES, <HI>has been cut out, because the circumstan|ces</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="105">
<HI>mentioned, and the terms used, are not exactly correspondent to the ideas of delicacy, which hap|pily, is in this age one of its characteristics.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the opening of the manuscript, there appears to be two leaves wanting; whether what is lost contained events or reflections, it is impossible to judge&mdash;the leaves are not torn, but cut out care|fully with a knife, close to the margin. The begin|ning of the third leaf, is the end of a reflection, of which</HI> itt, <HI>is the first word. For further information the reader shall be now left to Sir William himself, and it is hoped he will not rank the half hour spent in his society, amongst the most unprofitable half hours of his life.</HI></P>

<P>2. IN DEATHS OFT;</P>
<P>1. By suddain accidents.</P>
<P>In my infancy, when I lay in my cradle, I escaped a great danger, upon the casuall discharge of a peece, the shott whereof missed me very narrowly.</P>
<P>At Winchester Castle, I ran a great hassard of being buried under the ruines of an ould outwall, which I had been viewing, and considering how to have it taken down, and I was no sooner stept into the house (not above an easy stone's cast off) but itt fell, and covered all the place where I had been, and diverse yards beyond itt. My deare wife (the Lady Ann) had a deliverance of the very same kinde there likewise; having been to look att an ould staircase which was repairing, she was no sooner gon, but the place where she stood fell, and
<PB REF="112" MS="y">
<PB REF="113" MS="y">
<PB N="107" REF="114" MS="y">
in humane reason, she could not but have perished in the ruines.&mdash;</P>
<P>Att Cropredy in Oxfordshire, I escaped a great danger of the like nature, when being with my offi|cers att a councell of warr, the floore of the roome (where I was) sunke under me, and I lay over|whelmed with a great deal of lumber that fell upon me, and yet, blessed be God, I had no hurt att all. And att this place I did likewise escape a snare. After the battell, a message was sent to me by the King; when I had given my answer <HI>that I could not treat with his Majesty but by command of Parliament,</HI> I turned shortly round; when the trumpet said he had a <HI>private</HI> mesage for me, and praied me to hear him: I replyed there need be no privacy, not caring to give an handle to mine Enemies: but some that were neare me did persuade me to heare the man, and went out. He then presently pulled forth a letter, which to my great shame and surprise came from the Lady ******; in itt she besought me to betray my cause; and this she did so wittily and kinde, that I had much ado to be angry. Before this lady's marriage I had been her suitor, and did dearly love her, and she remembered me of this, and of some soft passages. Whether or not she was putt on this by some greater than herself, I never knew; but I returned for answer, that as I had
<PB N="108" REF="115" MS="y">
never been traitor to my love, so would I not to my cause, which I should be, if I did as she would advise, and after this I heard no more.&mdash;</P>
<P>2. BY GREAT SICKNESSES.&mdash;</P>
<P>I had a great deliverance from the plague att my house in Aldersgate-street, a chambermaid of my wifes being struck with itt (who died within a day or two after att the pesthouse, whither she was removed) my wife being then great with child (of my son Thomas) had her by the hand in her sickness, and was neare her, when she was in sweats, yet nei|ther she nor any of my family, were infected.</P>
<P>Att Calais I escaped the plague, when Sir Philip Stapleton died of itt, and I was with him and had him by the hand, not above five or six howers before he departed.</P>
<P>3. BY HASSARDS IN WARR.</P>
<P>In the warrs between the Venetians, and the Archduke Ferdinand (afterwards Emperour) att the leaguer before Rubia, I escaped severall very neere shott; one grazing att my foot, another light|ing between Sir John Vere and me, as we sate close together by the battery; and yet touched neither
<PB REF="116" MS="y">
<PB REF="117" MS="y">
<PB N="109" REF="118" MS="y">
of us, besides diverse others, both great and small shott that indangered me.</P>
<P>In the warr between the Emperour Ferdinand, and the King of Bohemia, I escaped miraculously out of the hands of the Cossacks, when in a skir|mish my horse was killed under me, and in the clearing of myself from him, I fell with my foot hanging in the stirrup, I was incompassed by them, and in making my way through them to my own men, had severall shott made att me, att a close dis|tance, yet itt pleased the Lord, none wounded; only one grazed lightly on the topp of my head, and I came off with safety.</P>
<P>Att the battell of Edghill, I had my horse shott under me, but I was preserved from any hurt.</P>
<P>Att the taking of Farnham Castle, I escaped a very neare shott, from one of mine own men, as he followed me in a narrow passage, after I was entred.</P>
<P>In my retreat from Chepstow, when Prince Maurice had lined all the passages between that and Glouces|ter, with a very considerable army, to intercept me; I had no way left, but to transport my foote and traine of Artillery cross the Severn to Barkley Castle (from whence they were secured) and with
<PB N="110" REF="119" MS="y">
my horse and dragoones to beat thro' his quarters; upon the march that night thorough the Forrest of Dean; itt happened thorough the sleepiness of an officer, that the maine body was separated a great distance from the fore troop (with which I marched) so that I was faine to make an halt for above halfe an hower, within litle more than a mile of the princes head quarter, in broad day light, the alarme taken, and not one hundred and twenty horse with me. Nevertheless itt pleased God in his infinit mercy to direct the rest of my troopes to me, and under the conduct of his providence, I made a safe and an honorable retreat to Gloucester, in despight of the enemy who charged me in the reare, but with more loss to him, than to me.</P>
<P>Att Landsdown, when I made the retreat, I es|caped a shower of shott.</P>
<P>At the Devises, when I beat the Lord Marquess Harford, Prince Maurice, and the Lord Hopton, with their remaining forces into the town, the se|cond night after I sat down before itt, having been out to visit the gardes, and returning to a farm|house (at the foot of Roundway Down) where I had given order to my cooke, that my supper should be ready against I came in, and finding my meat but newly laid to the fire; in a suddain impatience I re|solved
<PB REF="120" MS="y">
<PB N="111" REF="121" MS="y">
not to supp att all, and so tooke horse again, and rode upp to the topp, where the body of my horse lay. I was not gon above a muskett shott, but some of the ennemy (knowing the pasages there|about, which I did not; and rationally supposing I might quarter in that place; in regard of the conve|nient situation of itt, between my horse and my foot) came into the house and enquired, and made a search for me, and if I had staied there (as at first I intend|ed) in all probability they might have suddainly dis|patched me, and retired in the darkness of night, with safety enough.</P>
<P>Some dayes after, whilst I lay before the town, I rode with a small party about the quarters, particu|larly to see how the dragoones were laid, on the fur|ther side of the town; and being to returne back, itt pleased God to putt itt suddainly into my minde, to go by another way than that I came, which some of the party, and some of mine own servants (who staid a little behind) not observing, but taking the former way, they were almost all taken by the en|nemy. I came back safely.</P>
<P>Att Farnham God appeared wonderfully for me, when the Lord Hopton, drew upp his whole army within culverin shott of me, being (with the forces of Sir Jacob Ashly, who was then joined to him)
<PB N="112" REF="122" MS="y">
att the least eight thousand horse and foot; and (thorough the mistake or neglect of my adiutant-generall, and the slackness of my men, in drawing to the rendevous) I was not able to face him with two thousand men. In that extremity the Lord tooke opportunity to shew himself for me, and sent so thick a mist all the morning, that by reason of the darkness the ennemy durst not give on, and when the mist brake upp, I had such an ad|vantage of the ground, that my weakness re|mained undiscovered, and he drew off from me, I was that day delivred from an imminent destruc|tion.</P>
<P>Att Cheriton Field, I was in danger to have been taken or killed, the ennemy having by a charge given upon some troopes of mine, shutt me off from mine own men, I having then but three with me; but itt pleased God they were repulsed againe, and thereby a way opened for my retreat.</P>
<P>I may reckon itt a mercy, that upon a suddain oc|casion that day, charging without my headpeece, and being known by the ennemy (as I afterwards understood) I came off safe and unhurt.</P>
<P>When the King came suddainly upon me with his whole army att Andover, and I had then nothing
<PB REF="123" MS="y">
<PB N="113" REF="124" MS="y">
but a body of horse and dragoones with me, I made a fair retreat to Basingstoke.</P>
<P>Att the second Newbery fight, when I fell on with my troopes by the way off Speenfield, and wee were mingled with the ennemy, I had a great deliverence, for one of the adverse party coming behinde me, and being ready to fire his pistoll in my reines; in that instant one of my life guard killed him, or otherwise in all probability he had killed me.</P>

<P>IN JOURNYINGS OFT.</P>
<P>In my travell between Venice and Florence, I es|caped the danger of the Inquisition att Bolonia, where through the information of a priest (that came along in company with me from Venice) I was searched, my trunke, wherein I had nothing but clothes, was rifled to the bottome, but itt pleased God to so order itt, that they lett alone a box, wherein I had some papers, which might have ex|posed
<PB N="114" REF="125" MS="y">
me to question; when they had itt in their hands ready to open itt.</P>
<P>In my journey into Yorkeshire, to my Sisters house at Hickleton, (being accompanied with my wife the Lady Ann, and my dear mother) I reckon itt a great deliverance, that when my coach mares, upon the descent of an hill, had broken their raines, and overthrown the coachman from the box, and begun to run away, the raines falling down upon the ground, one of the mares, treading upon them, they checked her bitt, and made her stopp, which made the rest stand like-wise.</P>
<P>IN PERILLS IN THE CITTY.</P>
<P>When the army first marcht up to the citty of London, and made that breach upon the Parliament, I was voted to command a body of horse and dra|goones, in the nature of a flying army, for the de|fence of the King, Kingdome, Parliament, and Citty; and whilst I was acting (with others) accord|ing to my duty, at the Committee of Militia, to ad|vance that levy; wee were all unexpectedly deserted and betraied by the citty and left out of all capitu|lation; so that upon the entring of the army, we were
<PB REF="126" MS="y">
<PB REF="127" MS="y">
<PB N="115" REF="128" MS="y">
inforced to lye hidd, and within a few dayes after to make use of the passes which the House of Commons had given us, and to quit the kingdome. The Lord all that time preserved me from falling into the hands of the army, though I was pursued by land and sea.</P>
<P>When after the death of my late deare wife, I had sent out my sons to schoole, and removed my daughters, with some part of my goods, to the Lady Blanyes house in Long Acre (myself remain|ing in that desolate condition, a prisoner att St. James's) there was a base information given to the Councell of State, by a servant of mine (whome for a falsness I had putt away) that I had deposited plate and jewells, to a great vallue, in that good Ladyes custody; whereupon (without any cause alledged, or any thing att all in charge against me) they sent a warrant signed Bradshaw, by a sargeant att armes, to seize upon all thatt I had there, as belonging to an ennemy of the State. But itt plea|sed the wisdome of God to befoole their malice, that they made no search in mine own house, where all that I had of vallue was, but only in that place, where there was nothing but so incon|siderable a parcell of plate, that they were asham|ed
<PB N="116" REF="129" MS="y">
to keep itt, when they had itt; and so they sent itt back again. In the mean time I had leasure to dispose of what I had by me, to a place of safety.</P>
<P>March 22d, 1657. I was seized upon as a pri|soner by a warrant from the Protector, and brought to Whitehall, where I was examined by him. He did examin me as a stranger, not as one whome he had aforetime known, and obeyed; yet was he not discourteous, and itt pleased the Lord to preserve me, that not one thing objected could be prooved against me; so I was delivered, and returned with comfort to my family againe; blessed be the Name of the Lord!</P>
<P>IN PERILS AMONG FALSE BRETHREN.</P>
<P>It pleased the House of Commons to command my service, in taking care for the drawing upp for the Ordinance in favour of the Apprentices; upon which account some Apprentices (who negotiated that business for the rest) made their application to me; shortly after, when that petition from the citty was to be presented, which was followed with so much confusion, that it gave occasion, or pretence to the speaker, and diverse others of the House to with|draw
<PB REF="130" MS="y">
<PB N="117" REF="131" MS="y">
to the army; myself and the rest of the ele|ven members, having then gained the leave of the House, to absent ourselves, for six months (by that denial of our own right and priviledg, to preserve (if possible) the priviledg of Parliament from any further violation by the army) some two dayes be|fore the presentation of the above said petition, there came two persons to my house in Drury Lane, to speak with me, who, when I came out unto them, tould me they were apprentices of the Citty, and came to be advised by me, how they should manage their petition; to whom I replyd, that I knew no advice to be given, but that they should be carefull to attend the House as early as they could, before they were praeingaged in other busi|ness: but this did not serve their purpose, who came only to ensnare me; whereupon they moved further, and said, that myself and the other im|peached gentlemen were concerned in their petition, and that they must and would have us into the House againe. To which I returned no more, but that I should have no more to do in that business, and so I left them. This was all that passed, and yet those false impudent creatures made their re|port att the army, that I abetted that disorder and assault upon the House, and cooperated with the apprentices in itt, which served to exasperate the army so much the more against me. But it pleased
<PB N="118" REF="132" MS="y">
the Lord that they never had power to act any thing upon itt to my prejudice.</P>
<P>After I was made a prisoner by the army, and removed from the King's Head in the Strand to St. James, I had a message sent me from one Colonell Fitz-James with the signification of his respect to me, and compassion of me, representing the extreme danger in which I was, and the enevitable destruc|tion that attended me, if I did not endeavour to pre|vent itt by some escape; in order to that, he made me a tender of his assistance, ingaging himself, that he would sett me safe aboard a shipp, that lay ready in the river for me to transport me beyond the reach of all mine ennemies. But itt pleased God to pre|vent the effect of his treachery, both by giving me the confidence to stand upon mine own innocency, and by discovering to me, that that perfidious man (in the middest of all his protestations of friendshipp to me), had privately offered himself to give evidence against me att the barr of the House of Commons; so that it was a meere train, laid to bring a guiltiness upon me, and to take away my life.</P>
<P>The like offer was made to my wife in reference to the procurement of my escape out of Windsor Castle, by one Captain Kempe of Collonell Prides
<PB REF="133" MS="y">
<PB REF="134" MS="y">
<PB N="119" REF="135" MS="y">
regiment, with the addition of an intended cheat; but I was delivered as a bird, out of the snare of these fowlers, so that I was not catcht with their chaff.&mdash;</P>
<P>About the same time, shortly after my coming to Windsor Castle, having opportunity to send to my deare wife (whom I had left in a disconsolat con|dition att London, great with child, and within a few weeks of her delivery) as I had sealed my let|ter and was ready to dispatch itt away, I had no|tice given me by my keeper, that the Governour must see whatever letters I wrote or received; whereupon I bad him carry itt unto him, that he might open it if he thought fitt: But the Governour returned itt back unto me untouched, with this compliment, that I was very much mistaken in him if I thought he would be so unworthy, as to open letters between a man and his wife; and with some further expressions of respect to me, in regard, he had formerly served as a Lieutenant Colonell under me. This I tooke as a civility from him, but I found it after to be no other than a meere insiduous practise; for after an uninterrupted pasage of letters between my wife and me, for about a fortnight or three weekes, by which time he supposed, wee might be grown to a confidence to write freely, he suddainly seised upon all my let|ters.
<PB N="120" REF="136" MS="y">
But there was nothing to be found in them that could prejudice me, and so that snare likewise broke, and I escaped the danger of it. <HI>Blessed be God.</HI></P>

which were afterwards noticed in some sort by the Parliament; and there were those who fomented our discorde for their own advancement.

told that the Queen had something endeared her|self when att Exeter, by the following Charity. Walking out northward of the citty, soon after her laying in, she stopped att the cottage of a poore woman whom she heard making doleful cries. She sent one of her train to know what itt might be which occa|sioned itt; the page returned and said the woman was sorrowing grievously, because her daughter had been two days in the strawe, and was almost dead for want of nourishment, she having nothing to give her but water, and not being able for the hardness of the times to gett any thing. On this the Queen tooke a small chain of gould from her neck att which hung an agnus; she tooke off the agnus and putt itt in her bosom, and making the woman be called to her, gave her the chain and bad her to go into the citty to a gouldsmith and sell itt, and keepe the money to provide for the good woman in the strawe. And for this her confessor did afterward rebuke her, because they were hereticks: when this thing was told to the King, he asked, jestingly, if her Confessor had made the Queen do a penance for itt; as she haddon once before, for some innocent act, when she was made to walke to Tyburn, some say barefoot.</P>

My dismal defeat att Roundway Down was owing to those heart burnings and jealoucies; for the Gene|ral suffered the enemies horse to pass quietly, and without molestation, to the succour of their infantry which lay att the Devizes in miserable plight. <HI>The proud have laid snares for me,</HI> saith the Psalmist, <HI>and sett traps in my way.</HI> So sure was I of victory that I wrote to Parliament to bid them be att rest, for that I would shortly send them an account of

<PB REF="143" MS="y">
<PB N="125" REF="144" MS="y">
believe that he had them; for although he was blunt, he did not bear himself with pride, or dis|daine. As an oficer he was obedient, and did never dispute my orders, nor argue upon them. He did, indeed, seeme to have great cunning, and whilst he was cautious of his own words, not putting forth too many lest they should betray his thoughts, he made others talk, untill he had as it were sifted them, and known their inmost designs. A notable in|stance was his discovering in one short conversation with one Captain Giles (a great favorite with the Lord Generall, and whome he most confided in), that although his words were full of zeal, and his actions seemingly brave, that his heart was not with the cause: and in fine, this man did shortly after join the enemy at Oxford, with three and twenty stout fellowes. One other instance I will here sett down, being of the same sort, as to his cunning.</P>
<P>When I tooke the Lord Piercy att Andover, hav|ing att that time an inconvenient distemper, I de|sired Collonell Cromwell to entertaine him with some civility; who did afterwards tell me, that amongst those whom we tooke with him (being about thirty), their was a youth of so faire a coun|tenance, that he doubted of his condition; and to confirm himself willed him to sing; which he did with such a daintiness that Cromwell scrupled not

to say to Lord Piercy; that being a warriour, he did wisely to be accompanied by <HI>Amazons</HI>; on which that Lord, in some confusion, did acknowledg that she was a damsel; this afterwards gave cause for scoffe att the King's party, as that they were loose and wanton, and minded their pleasure, more than either their Country's service, or their Maister's good.</P>

<P>When it pleased God (after seven years expectati|on), that my first wife fell into travell, I could not but be very apprehensive of the weakness of her con|dition; and having retired myself to praier, and earnestly besought God to strengthen her, and being desirous to comfort myself out of Gods word, I tooke the bible to read, and letting itt fall, with

some passion, upon the table (without any particu|lar designe upon one place more than another) itt opened upon the 128 Psalme, in the singing Psalmes,

with which being surprised, I presumed to make a triall, whether itt were more than an ac|cident or no (the good Lord forgive me for that presumption), and taking upp another bible that lay by, itt opened likewise upon the same place: with|in a few howers after, my wife was safely delivered.</P>
<P>Not long after this, being at London, I was sud|dainly taken with a fitt of the stone, in that violence, that itt grew insupportable to me, whereupon I cast myself upon my knees, and besought God for his mercy to me, and before I rose upp, my paine was mitigated, and within one quarter of an hower I was perfectly well.</P>
<P>After the death of my first wife, and of my son which I had by her (both very deare blessings to me) when I putt on a resolution to marry againe, I humbly besought God to provide such a wife for me, as might be an help to me in the way of his service, and that I might have a religious woman, or none, and when his providence directed me to Lady Ann Finch, and that all things were agreed upon between my Lord her father and me, in refe|rence
<PB N="128" REF="149" MS="y">
to the marriage, upon her motion, she and I agreed together, to sett a day apart to seeke God for his blessing in itt. Itt pleased the Lord to an|swer our praiers in as full a measure of comfort, as ever was powred out opon a married couple: and though att the first there were some litle differences in our natures, and judgments (as to some particu|lars) yet within a litle while, that good God wrought us to that uniformity, that I may say wee were but as one soul, in two bodyes.</P>
<P>After I had quitted the service of the Parliament in the field, and was returned to London, and there settled with my family; my estate began to fall short, part thereof lying in the Kings Quar|ters; and the rest (through the distraction of the times) affording me very litle subsistence. To sup|ply my necessityes, I was faine to sell severall things; and in the end I was at such a pinch, as that without selling my plate (which I had kept as my last reserve of vallue) I knew not how to send to markett: whereupon my wife and I having recommended our condition to God, resolved the next morning to send our plate to the gouldsmiths, and to make money of itt. But the next morning I was wakened by my servant, who lett me know there was one come from Barnstaple with some mony for me. The sum was not above fifteen

<P>When his Majesty was at Worcester, I thought itt my duty to seeke God for him in that distressed condition; itt pleased the Lord to inlarge my heart, with much comfort, and to give me a confident as|surance, that I should have an answer of peace.

<P>After my returne from D&mdash;, when I tooke upp a resolution to marry againe; I besought God for his direction in my choice, who heard my petition, and sent me the Lady Harcourt to repaire the breach formerly made in my poore family; which was so rich a blessing, that I can never sufficiently acknowledg itt. That God (hearing praier) who hath (with the generall approbation of good men) united us by his sacred ordinance, and made us not only one flesh, but one spirit; one in our affections, judgments, wayes, ends, (as if wee had been both cutt out of one peece) he vouchsafes to preserve us together for the advancement of his service and glory.</P>
