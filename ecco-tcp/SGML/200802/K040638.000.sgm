<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the printing of this little Piece, it has been intimated to the Author, that he is likely to &s;uffer from &s;ome ill Will, occa&s;ioned by a very faulty, and very unfortunate, Opera of his repre&s;ented la&s;t Win|ter; but he begs leave to ob&s;erve, that it is again&s;t the Laws of <HI>England</HI> to try a Man twice for the &s;ame Fact; and more &s;o, after Puni&s;hment has been inflicted. He thinks it can hardly be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, that he never, in any of his Writings, intended to give the lea&s;t Offence: And as his tri|fling Productions, have more than once, been lucky enough to be ho|noured with the Approbation of the Public; he flatters him&s;elf, &s;hould he again be found capable of affording them an innocent Entertainment; that tho&s;e to who&s;e Ju&s;tice he mo&s;t readily &s;ub&s;cribes, will not refu&s;e him an Opportunity of appealing to their Candour.</P>

<P>Why, Colonel, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, I think there is no occa&s;ion to go out of our own country here; we have never a Duke in it I believe, but we have many an hone&s;t gentleman, who, in my opinion, might de|&s;erve the young lady.</P>

<P>Well, but li&s;ten to me, papa&mdash;When you go out with your gun, do you take any plea&s;ure in &s;hooting the poor tame ducks, and chickens in your yard? No, the partridge, the phea&s;ant, the woodcock are the game; there is &s;ome &s;port in bringing them down be|cau&s;e they are wild; and it is ju&s;t the &s;ame with an hu&s;band or a lover.

<P>Pray, Mr. Jenkins, how does Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a and our univer&s;ity friend Mr. Lionel? That is the only grave young man I ever liked, and the only hand&s;ome one I ever was acquainted with, that did not make love to me.</P>

<P>His father was a general officer, a particular friend of Sir John's, who, like many more brave men, that live and die in defending their country, left little el&s;e than honour behind him. Sir John &s;ent this young man, at his own expence, to Oxford; where, while his &s;on lived, they were upon the &s;ame footing: and &s;ince our young gentleman's death, which you know unfortunately happened about two years ago, he has continued him there. During the vacation he is come to pay us a vi&s;it, and Sir John intends that he &s;hall &s;hortly take orders, for a very con&s;iderable benefice in the gift of the family, the pre&s;ent incumbent of which is an aged man.</P>

<P>Well, ma&s;ter Jenkins! don't you think now that a Nobleman, a Duke, an Earl, or a Marquis, might be content to &s;hare his title&mdash;I &s;ay, you under|&s;tand me&mdash;with a &s;weetener of thirty or forty thou&s;and pounds, to pay off mortgages?

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why look you, ma&s;ter Jenkins, Sir John Flower|dale is an hone&s;t gentleman; our families are nearly re|lated; we have been neighbours time out of mind; and if he and I have an odd di&s;pute now and then, it is not for want of a cordial e&s;teem at bottom. He is going to marry his daughter to my &s;on; &s;he is a beautiful girl, an elegant girl, a &s;en&s;ible girl, a worthy girl, and&mdash;a word in your ear&mdash;damn me if I aint very &s;orry for her.</P>

<P>You know my wife is a woman of quality&mdash; I was prevailed upon to &s;end him to be brought up by her brother Lord Je&s;&s;amy, who had no children of his own, and promi&s;ed to leave him an e&s;tate&mdash;he has got the e&s;tate indeed, but, the fellow has taken

his Lord&s;hip's name for it. Now, ma&s;ter Jenkins, I would be glad to know, how the name of Je&s;&s;amy is better than that of Oldboy.</P>

I quarelled with his Lord&s;hip about &s;ix years before his death, and &s;o had not an opportunity of &s;ee|ing how the youth went on; if I had, ma&s;ter Jenkins, I would no more have &s;uffered him to be made &s;uch a monkey of&mdash;He has been in my hou&s;e but three days, and it is all turned top&s;y turvy by him and his ra&s;cally &s;ervants&mdash;then his chamber is like a perfumer's &s;hop, with wa&s;h-balls, pa&s;tes, and pomatum&mdash;and do you know he had the impudence to tell me ye&s;terday at my own table, that I did not know how to behave my|&s;elf?</P>

<P>What's the matter with the Colonel, Madam; does your lady&s;hip know? He &s;eems a little di&s;ordered in his &s;en&s;es; I don't think it would be ami&s;s to take out a commi&s;&s;ion of lunacy again&s;t him.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heigho! don't be &s;urpri&s;ed, my dear; it was the &s;ame thing with my late dear brother, Lord Je&s;&s;amy; they never could agree: that good natured, friendly &s;oul, knowing the delicacy of my con&s;titution, has often &s;aid, &s;i&s;ter Mary, I pity you. Not but your father has good qualities, and I a&s;&s;ure you I remember him a very fine gentleman him&s;elf. In the year of the hard-fro&s;t, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and thirty-nine, when he fir&s;t paid his addre&s;&s;es to me, he was called agreeable Jack Oldboy, though I married him without the con&s;ent of your noble grandfather.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Je&s;&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>He &s;hould wi&s;h to &s;ee her look a little like a gentlewoman fir&s;t. When &s;he was in London, la&s;t winter, I am told &s;he was taken notice of by a few men. But &s;he wants air, manner&mdash;</P>

<P>And has not a bit of the genius of our family, and I never knew a woman of it but her&s;elf without.

But, &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould not like her when I &s;ee her? Why, po&s;itively, then I will not have her; the treaty's at an end, and, &s;ans compliment, we break up the congre&s;s. But, won't that be cruel, after having &s;uffered her to flatter her&s;elf with hopes, and &s;hewing my&s;elf to her.

<P>Well, and how does my old friend Dick Rantum do? I have not &s;een him the&s;e twelve years: he was an hone&s;t worthy fellow as ever breathed; I remember he kept a girl in London, and was cur&s;edly plagued by his wife's relations.</P>

<P>Why, Sir, we hope not; but as the matter is dubious, and will probably make &s;ome noi&s;e, I thought it was better to be for a little time out of the way; when hearing my ca&s;e Sir Richard Rantum mentioned you; he &s;aid, he was &s;ure you would permit me to remain at your hou&s;e for a few days, and offered me a recommendation.</P>

<P>For Heaven's &s;ake, Jenny, don't &s;peak to me: I neither know where I am, nor what I am doing; I am the mo&s;t wretched and mi&s;erable of all mankind.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion,</SPEAKER>
<P>But, good Jenny, &s;ince, by &s;ome accident or other, you have been able to di&s;cover what I would willingly hide from all the world; I conjure you, as you regard my intere&s;t, as you value your Lady's peace and honour, never let the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of it e&s;cape you; for it is a &s;ecret of that importance&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, what would you &s;ay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid of the &s;tep we are going to take; indeed, I am: 'tis true, my father is the contriver of it; but, really, on con&s;ideration, I think, I &s;hould appear le&s;s culpable if he was not &s;o; I am at once criminal my&s;elf and rendering him ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you love me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppo&s;e I do, you give me a very ill proof of your love for me, when you would take advantage of my tenderne&s;s, to blind my rea&s;on: how can you have &s;o little regard for my honour as to &s;acrifice it to a vain triumph? For, it is in that light I &s;ee the ra&s;h action you are forcing me to commit; nay, me|thinks my con&s;enting to it &s;hould injure me in your own e&s;teem. When a woman forgets what &s;he owes her&s;elf, a lover &s;hould &s;et little value upon any thing &s;he gives to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you &s;uppo&s;e then, can you imagine, that my pa&s;&s;ion will ever make me forget the veneration&mdash; And, an elopement is nothing, when it is on the road to matrimony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>At be&s;t, I &s;hall incur the cen&s;ure of di&s;obe|dience, and indi&s;cretion; and, is it nothing to a young woman, what the world &s;ays of her? Ah! my good friend, be a&s;&s;ured, &s;uch a di&s;regard of the world is the fir&s;t &s;tep towards de&s;erving its reproaches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, the nece&s;&s;ity we are under&mdash;Mankind has too much good &s;en&s;e, too much good nature&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every one has good &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ee other people's faults, and good nature enough to
<PB N="53" REF="56">
overlook their own. Be&s;ides, the mo&s;t &s;acred things may be made an ill u&s;e of; and, even marriage it&s;elf, if indecently and improperly&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, get your&s;elf ready: where is your band-box, hat, and cloak? Slip into the garden; be there, at the iron-gate, which you &s;hewed me ju&s;t now; and, as the po&s;t-chai&s;e comes round, I will &s;tep and take you in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, one thing more. My fortune depends almo&s;t entirely upon my father's genero&s;ity: now, think, with your&s;elf, whether it would not be better to devi&s;e &s;ome other method.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hang fortune! It is the bane of love; and, therefore, they are both pictur'd blind, to &s;hew, that their coming together can never be premeditated; but, if they do meet, it is by chance, when they jo&s;tle, and one generally overturns t'other.</P>
