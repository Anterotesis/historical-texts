<L>THOUGH wild our theme, the grave hi&s;torian's page</L>
<L>Hath &s;anctify'd the tale through ev'ry age.</L>
<L>Who hath not heard of Argo &s;ent from Greece,</L>
<L>Of Ja&s;on's labours for the golden fleece,</L>
<L>And fond Medea's ill-requited aid</L>
<L>To that fal&s;e hero, who his vows betray'd?</L>
<L>In ev'ry clime, where learned Mu&s;es reign,</L>
<L>The &s;tage hath known Medea's mournful &s;train,</L>
<L>Hath giv'n the flying car, and magic rod</L>
<L>To her, th' avow'd de&s;cendant of a god.</L>
<L>The &s;torms of trouble, which afflict the great,</L>
<L>Teach private life to pri&s;e its tranquil &s;tate.</L>
<L>That truth the moral of our fable &s;hows</L>
<L>Too well in &s;cenes of unexampled woes,</L>
<L>Which here will ravage an exalted brea&s;t</L>
<L>Of merit con&s;cious, and with &s;hame oppre&s;t;</L>
<L>Where love and fury, grief and madne&s;s join'd</L>
<L>O'erturn the &s;tructure of a godlike mind.</L>
<L>Pow'r, wi&s;dom, &s;cience, and her birth divine</L>
<L>In vain to &s;hield her from di&s;tre&s;s combine;</L>
<L>Nor wi&s;dom, pow'r, nor &s;cience yield relief;</L>
<L>Her potent wand can vanqui&s;h all, but grief:</L>
<L>In vain her winged chariot &s;weeps the air</L>
<L>To &s;hun that mightier &s;orcere&s;s, de&s;pair.</L>
<L>The characters and pa&s;&s;ions hence expre&s;t</L>
<L>Are all &s;ubmitted to the feeling brea&s;t;</L>
