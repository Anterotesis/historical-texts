<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THO' Abundance of &s;olid Particulars are naturally &s;unk in the rapid Cur|rent of Time, while many le&s;s &s;ub|&s;tantial are floating upon the Surface, to the Hand of every ordinary Me|moriali&s;t: And though &s;ome &s;hining Circum&s;tances, in the pro&s;perous Part of Sir <HI>Wal|ter Ralegh</HI>'s Life, have been darkened through Envy; as others, in the unfortunate Period, through Intere&s;t, by the Age in which he lived; neverthe|le&s;s, his &s;ingle Life may perhaps be found more fruitful of memorable Incidents, than many Hi|&s;tories of intire Ages: In&s;omuch, as I may be ap|prehen&s;ive, with a late Collector of his Memoirs, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the de&s;cribing a Per&s;on of &s;o diffu&s;ive a Prai&s;e, &s;o equally great in &s;o many different Parts of Life, will be like attempting a Land&s;kip from a high Hill, where the Multiplicity and Extent of the Pro&s;pects may rather di&s;tract the Mind,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
than direct it; and call for Judgment to re&s;train the Fancy, which is apt to run Riot, when employed upon too many Objects."</Q> Many Guides may indeed appear to lead us through this Wilderne&s;s; but, numerous as the Authors are who mention him, they contain but Fragments of his Story; divers whereof, hitherto widely di&s;per&s;ed, have e&s;caped not only our general Hi&s;torians, but the many Compilers of di&s;tinct Pieces on his Actions. Even the Moderns, who have treated of him with Impartiality, have yet been deficient in point of Indu&s;try, &s;o as to prove no le&s;s injurious to his Merits, than &s;ome, who in his own Age con&s;pired to depreciate them. Hence the Genera|lity, having been too &s;uperficial and undige&s;ted; having neither regarded due Choice and Order of Matter, Proportion in the Parts, or Connexion of the whole; nor yet di&s;charged them&s;elves by &s;uch References to proper Vouchers, as might &s;atisfy tho&s;e Readers it is my Ambition to plea&s;e; I have e&s;teemed the Number of &s;uch Writers, no Di&s;cou|ragement to the Revival of his Story.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t for the Name of <HI>Ralegh,</HI> otherwi&s;e written <HI>Rale</HI> and <HI>Ralega,</HI> in &s;ome old Deeds I have formerly &s;een; it is certainly of great Antiquity in this Kingdom; &s;ince there are &s;ome Villages and Towns in the We&s;t, as well as other Parts, &s;o called, which might at fir&s;t receive their Denomi|nation from &s;ome, as well as afterwards give it to others, who were Natives or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors thereof, And &s;ince we are credibly informed, that one of tho&s;e Di&s;tricts belonged antiently to noble Lords of the &s;ame Name, as al&s;o that &s;everal of them were &s;o called from the very Family we are to &s;peak of: And as the <HI>Raleghs</HI> of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> will appear to have flouri&s;hed there before the Conque&s;t; they might be the Progenitors of tho&s;e in other Countries; as it is expre&s;ly intimated out of the
<PB N="5" REF="6">
Records they were of tho&s;e in <HI>Warwick&s;hire.</HI> But as we are al&s;o told of no le&s;s than five Knights of this Name, at one Time differently &s;ituated in that We&s;tern County before mentioned; and that there were three great Families &s;o named al&s;o there, con|temporary with Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s, who bore Arms different from tho&s;e of his paternal Coat; we may conclude, they were not all of one Li|neage; and at the &s;ame Time, that it is owing to the Eminency of this great Man, that a Di&s;tinction of the &s;everal Hou&s;es, and his in particular, when all but his were in a Manner extinct, has been &s;o elaborately endeavoured by the Antiquaries and Genealogi&s;ts of his own Time.</P>
<P>As to the Family of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> therefore in particular, it is generally agreed on, that <HI>Smal|ridge</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Axmin&s;ter,</HI> in the County of <HI>Devon,</HI> was one of their mo&s;t ancient Seats. But Sir <HI>William Pole,</HI> who is &s;aid to have been one of the greate&s;t Searchers into the Antiquities of that Country, has been &s;ingularly &s;hort in the Time of their fir&s;t &s;ettling there. However, if we &s;hould agree with him upon that Per&s;on for Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s direct Ance&s;tor, who fir&s;t removed thither out of <HI>Nettlecomb-Ralegh</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. from whom there is a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive De&s;cent of tho&s;e &s;ix Knights, Sir <HI>Wi|mond,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a Vi&s;itation-book, made <HI>anno</HI> 1623, of the Counties of <HI>Wilts, Dor&s;et</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> among the MS. Collections of <HI>Brown Willis</HI> E&s;q; of <HI>Whaddon Hall</HI> in <HI>Bucks,</HI> there is a Pedigree of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s Family from the Reign of King <HI>John;</HI> with a Copy whereof that worthy Antiquary having obliged me, I find this <HI>Wymond,</HI> in the Time of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. is therein called Lord of <HI>Coliton</HI> and <HI>Nettlecomb:</HI> So it may &s;eem, the E&s;tate in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI> was of latter Acce&s;&s;ion to the Family, and that in <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> the more ancient Seat; or that the Removal was made rather to the former, than the latter County.</NOTE>Sir <HI>Hugh,</HI> Sir <HI>John,</HI> Sir <HI>Peter,</HI> and two Sir <HI>Johns</HI> more; be&s;ides others, who were either

of the &s;ame Degree them&s;elves, or married into Families di&s;tingui&s;h'd with it, even down to <HI>Wi|mond</HI> the Grandfather of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh:</HI> I know not but it may be al&s;o allowed, that the Ho|nours of this Pedigree were &s;ufficient to have been boa&s;ted of by &s;ome of his Traducers. For tho', in the Eye of Heraldry, many Titles are accounted more noble than Knighthood; tho' native and pa|trimonial Dignities, or &s;uch as de&s;cend nece&s;&s;arily from Father to Son, may in the Eye of the com|mon lineal Claimant appear mo&s;t legitimate; and &s;uch as are venal, be e&s;teemed in that of the Wealthy, mo&s;t valuable; yet tho&s;e which are per|&s;onal, the individual Acqui&s;ition, or Recompence of every Man's proper Merit, will, in the Eye of Rea&s;on, be held mo&s;t honourable.</P>

Owner. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hooker</HI>'s <HI>Synop&s;is Chronographical,</HI> or hi&s;torical Record of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> a MS. as quoted by <HI>Prince,</HI> fol. 530. A Copy whereof, in this Author's Time, was in the cu&s;tody of Mr. <HI>John Ea&s;tchurch</HI> of <HI>Wood</HI> in that County; &s;till extant, as I have heard, in tho&s;e Parts; and Pity it is, that it has not yet &s;een the pub|lick Light; &s;ince above a hundred Years ago, it was revis'd by &s;o able a Judge of its Worth as Sir <HI>John Dodderidge,</HI> and had his Recommendation to the Pre&s;s.</NOTE>So much for the Antiquity of the Family in <HI>Devon&s;hire;</HI> and as for its Derivation, the &s;aid <HI>Hooker,</HI> even in a printed Dedication to Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> as I hinted (which he repeatedly confirms in the afore&s;aid Performance) not only avouches his Alliance to the <HI>Courtenays,</HI> Earls of <HI>Devon,</HI> and other illu&s;trious Hou&s;es; but traces the Stream of Con&s;anguinity up to the Kings of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> where he &s;ays, <HI>That one of his Ance&s;tors in the directe&s;t Line, Sir</HI> John de Ralegh <HI>of</HI> Fardel <HI>(ano|ther Seat of their ancient Inheritance in the Pari&s;h of</HI> Cornwood, <HI>eight Miles Ea&s;t of</HI> Plymouth) <HI>e&s;pou&s;ed the Daughter of Sir</HI> Roger D'Amerei, <HI>who married</HI> Elizabeth <HI>Daughter of</HI> Gilbert <HI>Earl of</HI> Glouce&s;ter, <HI>by</HI> Joan D'Acres, <HI>Daughter of King</HI> Edward I. <HI>which</HI> Gilbert <HI>was de&s;cended of</HI> Robert <HI>Earl of</HI> Glou|ce&s;ter, <HI>Son of King</HI> Henry I.

<PB N="8" REF="9">
Race of the <HI>Raleghs,</HI> but only one &s;elect Per&s;on of the Name, here let the Truth, as to the&s;e remote Ance&s;tors or Alliances, hover for me; for I am not moved, on the Wings of Conjecture, to make my&s;elf a Party with any of tho&s;e Antiquaries, nor &s;hall endeavour to compromi&s;e the Difference be|tween them, unle&s;s &s;uch prevailing Authorities had occurr'd, as would enable me to do it with Cer|tanity. Be&s;ides, as tho&s;e who&s;e Virtues have adorned them with a Sufficiency of <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Ho|nours, are ever lea&s;t anxious about &s;uch as are <HI>re|lative;</HI> &s;o it might well argue but little <HI>Weight</HI> in the Judgment of a Hi&s;torian, to &s;hew him&s;elf con|tentious about the&s;e <HI>Feathers</HI> for his Worthy; e&s;pe|cially &s;uch a one, as &s;hall be found to have thought &s;o ju&s;tly <HI>light</HI> of them him&s;elf.</P>
<P>However, as all Accounts allow him a very ho|nourable Extract; let us prefer which we plea&s;e, the Freedom &s;ome great Courtiers took in calling him <HI>Jack</HI> and <HI>Up&s;tart,</HI> upon his Advancement to Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Favour, is thought to have &s;ome|what reflected rather on them&s;elves; in &s;uffering their &s;prightly Parts to take &s;uch Advantage of their noble Principles. One of the&s;e Sarca&s;ms I find re|corded by Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> in his little Book of <HI>Apoph|thegms,</HI> where he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That when Queen <HI>Eliza|beth</HI> had advanced <HI>Ralegh,</HI> &s;he was one Day playing on the Virginals, and my Lord of <HI>Ox|ford</HI> with another Nobleman &s;tood by; when it happen'd that the Ledge before the Jacks was taken away, &s;o that they were &s;een; whereupon that Lord and the other Nobleman &s;mil'd and whi&s;per'd a little; the Queen mark'd it, and would needs know, <HI>what was the Matter?</HI> His Lord&s;hip an&s;wer'd, <HI>They laugh'd to &s;ee, that when</HI> Jacks <HI>went up,</HI> Heads <HI>went down.</HI>"</Q> Tho' the Application of this Reflection particularly to <HI>Ralegh,</HI> if &s;uch was made, is di&s;putable, notwith|&s;tanding
<PB N="9" REF="10">
Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Allu&s;ion, yet it is plain, that Sir <HI>Robert Naunton,</HI> who was Secretary of State at the Time of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Death, and who&s;e <HI>Ob&s;erva|tions</HI> on that Queen's <HI>Favourites</HI> were written, though not printed, before tho&s;e <HI>Apophthegms,</HI> thought al&s;o, that it was made upon <HI>Ralegh;</HI> for he has &s;aid, with Relation to this Je&s;t by that witty Earl, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We all know it &s;avours more of Emulation and his Humour, than of Truth; it being a cer|tain Note of the Times, that the Queen, in her Choice, never took into her Favour a mere new Man, or a Mechanick."</Q> But it is believ'd, Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> him&s;elf was afterwards pretty even with his <HI>Quality-critics;</HI> where he &s;o &s;olidly expo&s;es the Emptine&s;s of Merit, nay, the real Detriment to it, in Po&s;terity's being entitled to the Rewards of their Ance&s;tor's Virtues, by <HI>hereditary</HI> Honours, Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Blood,</HI> and Nobility in <HI>Parchment; tho&s;e only being truly</HI> noble, <HI>who by worthy Acts have render'd them&s;elves most</HI> notable.</P>
<P>All therefore that needs be added on this Head, as a Matter more immediately requi&s;ite, and indeed &s;ufficient for my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, is, That Sir <HI>Wal|ter Ralegh</HI> was the Son of <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> E&s;q; of <HI>Fardel</HI> afore&s;aid; who being thrice married, had by his fir&s;t Wife <HI>Joan,</HI> Daughter of <HI>John Drake</HI> of <HI>Exmouth</HI> in <HI>Devon,</HI> E&s;q; two Sons, one named <HI>George,</HI> and the other <HI>John;</HI> which la&s;t married <HI>Anne</HI> the Daughter of Sir <HI>Bartholomew Forte&s;cue</HI> of <HI>Filley</HI> in <HI>Devon,</HI> and Relict of&mdash;<HI>Gaicrick</HI> of <HI>Ford;</HI> and they had I&s;&s;ue. His &s;econd Wife was Daughter of one <HI>Darell</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> by whom he had a Daughter named <HI>Mary,</HI> who was married to <HI>Hugh Snedale</HI> of <HI>Hilling</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> E&s;q; and had I&s;&s;ue: His third Wife was <HI>Catherine</HI> Daughter of Sir <HI>Philip Champernon</HI> of <HI>Modbury,</HI> and Relict of <HI>Otho Gilbert</HI> of <HI>Compton</HI> in <HI>Devon,</HI> E&s;q; He had by this la&s;t <HI>Venter,</HI> his third Son, <HI>Carew,</HI> after|wards
<PB N="10" REF="11">
knighted, and of <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> who married <HI>Dorothy</HI> Daughter of Sir <HI>William Wroughton,</HI> and Relict of Sir <HI>John Tbynn;</HI> by whom he had I&s;&s;ue; and la&s;tly, his fourth Son, named <HI>Walter,</HI> the Subject of our en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e; who was thereby the <HI>uterine</HI> Brother of tho&s;e three eminent Knights, Sir <HI>John,</HI> Sir <HI>Humphry,</HI> and Sir <HI>Adrian Gilbert.</HI> By this la&s;t Wife, Mr. <HI>Ralegh</HI> had al&s;o one Daugh|ter, named <HI>Margaret;</HI> who was married fir&s;t to&mdash;<HI>Radford</HI> of <HI>Mount Radford</HI> in <HI>Devon,</HI> Clerk of the Peace; and afterwards to&mdash;<HI>Hull</HI> of <HI>Larkebre,</HI> E&s;q; in St. <HI>Leonard</HI>'s Pari&s;h, <HI>Exeter.</HI></P>
<P>The Family was indeed at this Time much de|clin'd from its former Splendor of Fame and Af|fluence of Fortune; for the E&s;tate of <HI>Smalridge,</HI> which remain'd in the Name of <HI>Ralegh</HI> to the Time of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was then &s;old, by Sir <HI>Wal|ter</HI>'s Grandfather <HI>Wimond,</HI> to <HI>John</HI> the Father of Sir <HI>John Gilbert</HI> of <HI>Compton;</HI> but I cannot find it reduc'd to that low Ebb, in the latter Re&s;pect, which &s;ome have intimated; for <HI>Fardel</HI> remained &s;till in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which, after the Death of Sir <HI>Walter</HI>'s Father, &s;ell to the elde&s;t Son <HI>George;</HI> and there were be&s;ides <HI>Widdycomb Ralegh,</HI> and <HI>Coliton-Ralegh</HI> in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; the former of which was &s;old, by Sir <HI>Walter</HI>'s elder Brother Sir <HI>Carew Ralegh,</HI> to <HI>George</HI> the natural Son of <HI>George</HI> afore&s;aid; and the latter was &s;old, by Sir <HI>Walter</HI> him&s;elf, to <HI>Richard Martin,</HI> or his Father, of <HI>Exeter.</HI> But neither of the&s;e Places claim the Ho|nour of his Birth.</P>
<P>For his Father having the Remainder of a four-&s;core-years Lea&s;e, in a plea&s;ant Farm call'd <HI>Hayes,</HI> &s;ituate in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Budley,</HI> in that Part of <HI>De|von&s;hire</HI> bordering Ea&s;tward upon the Sea, near where the <HI>Ottery,</HI> or River of <HI>Otters,</HI> di&s;charges it|&s;elf into the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Channel; and re&s;iding upon the &s;aid Farm during the Time of his la&s;t Mar|riage;
<PB N="11" REF="12">
this was the Birth-place of Sir <HI>Walter Ra|legh;</HI> and it is accordingly di&s;tingui&s;h'd, as for nothing more remarkable, by topographical Writers to this Day. After the Expiration of that Lea&s;e, <HI>Ralegh</HI> apply'd, but un&s;ucce&s;sfully, to Mr. <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Otterton,</HI> to whom the E&s;tate devolv'd, to fell it him; as appears by <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Letter to him, wherein he &s;ays, <HI>That for the natural Di&s;po&s;ition he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ad to the Place, being born in that Hou&s;e, he had rather &s;eat him&s;elf there, than any where el&s;e.</HI> From whence, it &s;eems, that what &s;ome are, by another <HI>Devonian</HI> Antiquary, &s;aid to have reported, and him&s;elf appears only to have recorded; as if <HI>Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh <HI>was born in the City of</HI> Exeter, <HI>and in the Hou&s;e adjoining to the Palace-Gate;</HI> has no Authority, and perhaps, had not &s;o much as Ru|mour to countenance it.</P>
<P><HI>As to the Time of his Birth; I find the Com|putation has been made from</HI> Camden<HI>'s Account of his Age at his Death, that he was born in the Year 1552. And herewith corre&s;ponds an Ob|&s;ervation I have found in an a&s;trological Author, who, fixing his Birth in the &s;ixth Year of King</HI> Edward <HI>VI. which an&s;wers to the Year of our Lord afore&s;aid, calls it,</HI> A Year remarkable in our Chro|nicles; fir&s;t, for that &s;trange Shole of the large&s;t Sea-fi&s;hes, which, quitting their native Waters for fre&s;h and unta&s;ted Streams, wandered up the <HI>Thames</HI> &s;o high, till the River no longer retained any Brac|ki&s;hne&s;s; and &s;econdly, for that it is thought to have been &s;omewhat &s;tained in our Annals with the Blood of the noble <HI>Seymer,</HI> Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et:</HI> Events (&s;ays he) &s;urpri&s;ingly analogous both to the Life of this adventurous Voyager, Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> who&s;e Delight was in the hazardous Di&s;covery of unfrequent|ed Coa&s;ts; and al&s;o to his unfortunate Death.</P>
<P>That his younger Years were &s;ea&s;oned at the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> we may gather from good
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Authorities; as <HI>Hooker</HI> afore&s;aid, Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> and <HI>Anthony Wood;</HI> which la&s;t &s;ays, <HI>He became Com|moner of</HI> Oriel College, <HI>in or about the Year</HI> 1568, <HI>when his Kin&s;man</HI> C.

What Time then can we &s;pare for his Re&s;idence at <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> College al&s;o, in that Univer&s;ity; whereof Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI> would needs have him a Member, either before or after he was of <HI>Oriel;</HI> unle&s;s we could find, as I fear we &s;hall not, that he return'd from the School of <HI>Mars,</HI> to that of the <HI>Mu&s;es?</HI> Little more can we expect to have been ob&s;erved of this remote Part of his Life; and yet &s;omething more in it has been pre&s;erved by Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> afore&s;aid, who had the Judgment to fore&s;ee, that every little Circum&s;tance would be acceptable of a Man, who&s;e Fortunes and Mis|fortunes had render'd him &s;o memorable. And indeed it has been repre&s;ented to me as a Matter of no &s;mall Honour to Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> that a ca&s;ual Expre&s;&s;ion of his, in his immature and greene&s;t Years, &s;hould prefer it &s;elf to the Comme|moration of that great Philo&s;opher, in his &s;age&s;t and mo&s;t advanced Age. But as he had ob&s;erved, on the Nature of Things, that great Objects may be di&s;cern'd through a little Crevice; &s;o he knew, with Re&s;pect to the Nature of Men, that a great Di&s;covery of Genius may be made through a &s;mall and &s;udden Repartee; and hence might he be moved to remember; <HI>That while</HI> Ralegh <HI>was a Scholar at</HI> Oxford, <HI>there was a cowardly Fellow,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="14">
<HI>who happened to be a very good Archer; but having been gro&s;ly abu&s;ed by another, he bemoaned him&s;elf to</HI> Ralegh, <HI>and a&s;k'd his Advice;</HI> What he &s;hould do to repair the Wrong that had been offer'd him?

<P>How long he continued at the Univer&s;ity, is at la&s;t rightly concluded by <HI>Anthony Wood</HI> to be un|certain; but as &s;ure as he thinks him&s;elf right in &s;ettling him a Student of the Municipal Laws in the <HI>Middle Temple,</HI> upon &s;eeing a Copy of Ver&s;es he might write in that Inn of Conrt; I take this A&s;&s;ertion to be a greater Uncertainty than the other. For though Sir <HI>Robert Naunton,</HI> and po&s;|&s;ibly from him mo&s;t other Writers of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Life, have al&s;o con&s;ign'd him to the Study of the Law, on his leaving <HI>Oxford;</HI> there is a late Author who believes it a Mi&s;take &s;o obvious, that no Merit can rea&s;onably be a&s;&s;um'd from correcting it; for Sir <HI>Walter,</HI> at his Arraignment, in a Reply to the At|torney-general, lays a heavy Imprecation upon him&s;elf, <HI>If ever he read a Word of Law or Statutes, before he was a Pri&s;oner in the Tower.</HI> So that if this <HI>Ralegh</HI> was the Author of that Poem before mentioned, and of the <HI>Middle-Temple</HI> in that Year it was written, which we &s;hall pre&s;ently arrive at, we mu&s;t yet take Care to keep the <HI>Lawyer</HI> clear from the <HI>Templar.</HI></P>
<P>For we are expre&s;ly told by <HI>Hooker, That after</HI> Ralegh <HI>had laid a good Ground to build his Actions on at the Univer&s;ity, he travell'd into</HI> France; and this is confirm'd by <HI>Camden,</HI> according to who&s;e Account of the Time, <HI>Ralegh</HI> could not be, at his Departure, above &s;eventeen Years of Age; and by the Occa&s;ion of his fir&s;t going over, it will appear that a military Cour&s;e of Life fir&s;t fledg'd his Fame.

<P>And this will lead us near the Time we are to look for him in <HI>London,</HI> if we take for our Guide in the Chronology of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Life, that Copy of Ver&s;es before-mentioned which <HI>Anthony Wood</HI> took for his, in Relation to <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Profe&s;&s;ion.

but more e&s;pecially, becau&s;e there are &s;ome glim|mering Circum&s;tances which render the Writing of that Piece by this our Author probable to me; as namely, a Kind of familiar Dependency which that <HI>Ga&s;coigne</HI> had upon the Lord <HI>Gray</HI> of <HI>Wilton;</HI> as in the Dedication of this, and &s;ome other of his Works, is evident; under which Nobleman <HI>Ra|legh</HI> will &s;oon after appear to have &s;erved in the Wars of <HI>Ireland.</HI> Again, <HI>Ga&s;coigne</HI> had led a Life &s;omewhat like <HI>Ralegh</HI> in foreign Travel and mili|tary Services: Then 'tis to be noted <HI>Ga&s;coigne</HI> u&s;ed the very Motto, under his Picture prefixed to that Satyr before-mentioned; which after his Death is &s;o well known to have been a&s;&s;umed by, or appropri|ated to, <HI>Ralegh</HI> him&s;elf; <HI>Tam Martii, quam Mer|curio.</HI> All which &s;eem to &s;hadow out the Links, if not the perfect Chain, of &s;ome Acquaintance be|tween them.

<HI>La&s;tly,</HI> As to the Particular of his Being at this Time of the <HI>Middle-Temple,</HI> all we can conclude of it is, &s;ince he has &s;o publickly and &s;olemnly prote&s;t|ed he never &s;tudied the Law there; that it might be as cu&s;tomary in the Inns of Court then, as it is now, for a young Gentleman to be with a Friend, or have the U&s;e of his Chambers while he is out of Town, or even have Chambers of his own, rather than be confined to the Singularities of a Family in Lodgings, and never read a Word of the Law; much le&s;s have any Purpo&s;e to practi&s;e it.</P>

For the States having thus gather'd a powerful Ar|my, and planted them&s;elves near the Village of <HI>Rimenant,</HI> about a League from <HI>Mecklin; Don John,</HI> at the Head of, &s;ome &s;ay thirty thou&s;and Men, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Prince of <HI>Parma, Mon|dragon,</HI> and other the be&s;t Commanders of <HI>Spain,</HI> now re&s;olved to give them Battle. He made a fu|rious On&s;et; but in the End, by a notable Strata|gem, was deluded to a great Overthrow. For perceiving, as he thought, the whole Confederate Army encamped before the &s;aid Village, in an open and inviting Plain; <HI>Don John</HI> precipitou&s;ly detach'd a &s;tronger Force to encounter them; which &s;o &s;ucceeded on both Sides, that the States Army, after a convenient Re&s;i&s;tance, feigning a Flight, quitted this their Counterfeit Camp; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> eagerly pur&s;uing, in a &s;cattered and di&s;|orderly Manner, to compleat their &s;uppo&s;ed Vic|tory; till, amaz'd, they found them&s;elves in the Mid&s;t of the Fugitives true Camp, environ'd with nineteen thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot; a Number con&s;iderably greater than the A&s;&s;ailants. To ex|tricate them&s;elves was impo&s;&s;ible; there was a River on one Side; when they attempted the Thicket on the other, it was lined with an armed Ambu&s;cade of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots;</HI> and when they a&s;|&s;aulted the Trenches, they could not &s;u&s;tain the Fury of the Artillery. Yet was the Battle vi|gorou&s;ly maintained from Morning till Night; tho' the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> harra&s;s'd by a long and weari&s;ome March, came but a Day, &s;ome &s;ay but

an Hour, to the Field, before the Encounter be|gan; and yet partly thro' Bravery, partly thro' the &s;ultry Warmth of the Weather; or, as one Author has it, more &s;en&s;ible of a little Heat of the Sun, than any cold Fears of Death, they made them&s;elves further remarkable, by &s;tripping off Armour and Cloaths, and fighting in their Shirts; till at la&s;t, tho&s;e who had pur&s;ued the States Army in a pre|tended Flight, were them&s;elves driven, with great Slaughter, to a real one.</P>
<P>Soon after his Brother Sir <HI>Humphry Gilbert,</HI> hav|ing now newly obtain'd a Patent of the Queen to plant and inhabit &s;ome Northern Parts of <HI>America,</HI> unpo&s;&s;e&s;s'd by any Prince with whom &s;he was in Alliance, &s;oon engaged <HI>Ralegh,</HI> upon his Return into <HI>England,</HI> who was always ready to gra&s;p at every Occa&s;ion, that might reputably advance his Fortune or his Knowledge, to embark in this Ad|venture. For tho' the Coa&s;ts from the Cape of <HI>Florida</HI> Northward to the I&s;les now called the <HI>Newfoundlands,</HI> had been before di&s;covered by <HI>John Cabot</HI> the Father, with <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> and <HI>Sancius</HI> his Sons, both <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> born, through the Au|thority and Expence of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. yet there wanted not only more inland Re&s;earches and the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity, but the very Trade and Commerce with <HI>Newfoundland</HI> was very &s;loth|fully neglected, even &s;ince the Reign of King <HI>Ed|ward</HI> VI; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And yet within four Years before Sir <HI>Humphrey Gilbert</HI> ob|tain'd his Patent, there re&s;orted to the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Newfoundland</HI> for Fi&s;h about fifty Sail of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> above a hundred Sail of <HI>Spa|niards</HI> for Cod, and thirty more from <HI>Bi&s;cay</HI> for Whale to make Train-oil; above fifty Sail of <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> and about an hundred and fifty Sail of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Bretaigns.</HI> My Author ob&s;erves, that the Trade our Nation had then to <HI>Iceland,</HI> was the Rea&s;on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were not there in &s;uch Numbers as other Nations.</NOTE>for our Merchants and Adventurers in his Time enrich'd this Nation con&s;iderably from

their Fi&s;hery in tho&s;e Parts, as appears by that Act, wherein Care is taken to prevent the Exaction of any Doles or Taxes from them by the Officers of the Admiralty, that they might not be di&s;courag'd from the Merchandize of Fi&s;h, but tran&s;port it more plentifully into the Realm, and at more rea|&s;onable Rates. Now <HI>Gilbert</HI> having, as I &s;aid, pro|cured an ample Commi&s;&s;ion to repo&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e Ad|vantages with Improvement, many Gentlemen of good Account re&s;orted to him, among whom was his Brother <HI>Ralegh;</HI> &s;o that from the&s;e Preparations was expected a potent Fleet. Neverthele&s;s, among &s;uch Variety of Volunteers, Di&s;po&s;itions were va|rious; which in the End bred Divi&s;ion, and even Confu&s;ion of the Attempt; for, after the Shipping was by Degrees prepared, and the Men ready to go aboard; &s;ome di&s;agreeing in Opinion, &s;ome &s;hrink|ing at Obedience, and others failing of their Pro|mi&s;es and Engagements; the greater Number were di&s;per&s;ed, leaving the General, with a few only of his a&s;&s;ured Friends. <HI>However, with the&s;e he ven|tur'd to Sea; where, having ta&s;ted of no le&s;s Mis|fortune, he was &s;hortly after driven to retire home with the Lo&s;s of a tall Ship; and more to his Grief, of a valiant Gentleman named</HI> Miles Morgan. Now this Misfortune at Sea, and Lo&s;s of a Ship with that valiant Gentleman, I have not only Rea&s;on to believe was by a &s;harp Encounter they had with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> however tenderly touch'd at that Time, perhaps to avoid their Triumph; but that <HI>Ralegh</HI> was in this very Engagement, and his Life in great Danger thereby. For there is another Au|thor, who, in his Addre&s;s to him before mention'd, tells him, that after his Return from his Land-&s;er|vices, having gained &s;ufficient Knowledge and Ex|perience therein; <HI>to the End that you might be every Way able to &s;erve your Prince and Commonwealth</HI>

<P>This ill Succe&s;s kept not the&s;e Adventures long abroad; and now new Di&s;turbances broke out, which called for Men of Experience in War at home. For the fir&s;t Dart of any Con&s;equence which was thrown from <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Rome</HI> upon <HI>Ire|land,</HI> being in 1580, we &s;hall then find <HI>Ralegh</HI> among that Body of his Countrymen which effec|tually broke its Force, and &s;hielded off the Mi&s;chief wherewith it would otherwi&s;e have gall'd that King|dom.

In that Condition he was kept, till by Letters from the Lord Ju&s;tice named Sir <HI>William Pelham,</HI> and the Council, he was deliver'd to Sir <HI>Warham Sent|leger,</HI> then Provo&s;t mar&s;hal of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> and to Captain <HI>Ralegh;</HI> and according to the Commi&s;&s;ion directed to them, he was examin'd, indicted, ar|raign'd; and then, upon Judgment; drawn, hang'd, and quarter'd; and his Head and Limbs impal'd upon the City-gates of <HI>Cork,</HI> &s;or a Terror to his A&s;&s;ociates, and a Prey for the Fowls of the Air. And this is the fir&s;t Appearance we meet with of <HI>Ralegh</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> enough to &s;hake the Re|port of tho&s;e who &s;ay he was a <HI>Militia</HI> there, and had his fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion from <HI>Arthur</HI> Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> Baron of <HI>Wilton.</HI></P>
<P>But the chief Commander in the&s;e parts at this Time was the Earl of <HI>Ormond,</HI> &s;oon after Governor of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> a Man of &s;uch Loyalty, as to have re|duc'd his rebellious Brothers to Allegiance; and of &s;uch Courage, as con&s;tantly partaking in every Danger with his own Soldiers, made him much beloved by all his Adherents; while his apparent Contempt thereby of that Danger, gain'd him no le&s;s Fear from all his Adver&s;aries. He, on the other Side, bending his Cour&s;e again&s;t the foreign Enemy, encamped his Army at <HI>Tralegh,</HI> within

K&eacute;n of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fort afore&s;aid: Hereupon many of tho&s;e Invaders di&s;lodged, whom the Earl va|liantly engag'd, &s;laying &s;ome, and taking others Pri&s;oners; the re&s;t flew to the Coverts of <HI>Glaningell.</HI> The Pri&s;oners he took, confe&s;s'd their Force was not above &s;even hundred &s;trong; but that they had brought Arms and Ammunition for five thou&s;and Natives, be&s;ides a Ma&s;s of Money for the <HI>De&s;|monds</HI> and Dr. <HI>Sanders,</HI> and daily expected farther Supplies from <HI>Rome;</HI> for it was ab&s;olutely deter|mined by the Pope and King <HI>Philip</HI> to make a compleat Conque&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and <HI>England</HI> be|&s;ides; nay, &s;o confident they &s;eemed of Succe&s;s, if we can credit the A&s;&s;ertion of an Author who was this Year in <HI>Spain,</HI> that his Holine&s;s had provided a Chalice to drink the Queen of <HI>England</HI>'s precious Blood, &s;ays he, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;hould be made a Sa|crifice.

And, finding him|&s;elf of unequal Force to with&s;tand another Salley the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made, returned to join the Deputy at <HI>Rakele;</HI> who having now about eight hundred Hor&s;e and Foot with him, under the Conduct of Captain <HI>Ralegh, Zouch, Denny, Mackworth,</HI> and others, decamped and marched up towards the Fort.

They came accordingly with their wonted Con|&s;tancy and Greedine&s;s; but in the Mid&s;t of their Proling, <HI>Ralegh</HI> fell upon them &s;o advantageou&s;ly, that he enclos'd them all with his Men, and took
<PB N="30" REF="31">
every Rebel upon the Spot, who was not &s;lain in Re&s;i&s;tance. Among them there was one laden with Withies, who being demanded, <HI>What he in|tended to have done with them?</HI> Boldly an&s;wer'd, <HI>To have hung up the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Churls. Well,</HI> &s;aid Ralegh; <HI>but they &s;hall now &s;erve for an</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>Kern;</HI> &s;o commanded him to be immediately tuck'd up in one of his own Neckbands; and dealt with the re&s;t of the&s;e Robbers and Murderers according to their De&s;erts.

<P>While the Lord Deputy lay before the Fort, there arriv'd in the Bay of <HI>Smerwick,</HI> Vice-admiral <HI>Bingham,</HI> and &s;oon after Sir <HI>William Winter,</HI> Ad|miral of the Fleet, with fre&s;h Supplies: Hereupon the Lord Deputy re&s;olved to be&s;iege the Fort by Land, while the Admiral &s;hould batter it by Sea.

were &s;o di&s;appointed, through the Vigilance and Valour of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Company, and that of Captain <HI>Denny,</HI> that &s;uch as were not left dead behind, were forced to retreat with more Ha&s;te than good Speed. The Culverins and other Pieces of Ord|nance being now landed, and a large mountainous Bank laboriou&s;ly cut through, for the Carriages to pa&s;s to the Place convenient for planting them; the Deputy is &s;aid to have given the Enemy another Summons by Cannon-&s;hot to &s;urrender, and re|ceive Mercy. But they an&s;wer'd as before; there|upon the Artillery was order'd to attack the Fort both by Land and Water. <HI>Ralegh</HI> commanded the fir&s;t three Days after the Opening of the Trenches; and a&s;&s;aulted the Fort &s;o roughly from his Battery, that he forced the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to &s;everal Excur&s;ions; but they &s;kirmi&s;h'd &s;o warily, and hived again &s;o nimbly, that there was no clo&s;ing with them effec|tually. The fourth Day was commanded by <HI>Zouch,</HI> under whom <HI>John Cheke,</HI> the Son of a Knight well known among the learned for his Writings, ven|turing &s;o near the Fort as to look over the Parapet, being ob&s;erved by a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who levell'd his Piece, and brought him to the Ground. But now the Trenches for the full Battery were drawn &s;o near the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> play'd their Cannon &s;o furiou&s;ly and ince&s;&s;antly upon them from every Side; and finding no Succours arrive, they beat a Parley, and hung out the white Flag, crying out <HI>Mi&s;ericordia, Mi&s;ericordia;</HI> but the Lord De|puty would not li&s;ten to any Treaty with the Con|federates of Traitors and Rebels; no, not &s;o much as to their Departure with Bag and Baggage, or free Pa&s;&s;age to any one particular Per&s;on; nothing but an ab&s;olute Surrender. And as for Mercy, which <HI>Hooker</HI> before intimates to have been offer'd on provi&s;o of their timely Submi&s;&s;ion, we find by
<PB N="32" REF="33">
<HI>Edmund Spen&s;er,</HI> who was then Secretary to the Lord Deputy, and upon the very Spot, that his Lord&s;hip never gave the <HI>Spaniards</HI> any Hopes of it.</P>
<P>For after the Lord Deputy had di&s;covered that they had yielded, and &s;urrendered the Fort, on the Ninth of <HI>November, Ralegh</HI> and <HI>Mackworth,</HI> who had the Ward of that Day, fir&s;t entered the Ca&s;tle, and, with their Companies, made a great Slaugh|ter; &s;o that except one <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Nobleman, who was reprieved, another <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> and an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who were &s;ent to publick Execution, except al&s;o <HI>San Jo&s;epho</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Commander, and his Camp ma&s;ter, with a few <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Officers, who were &s;ent Pri&s;oners into <HI>England,</HI> and re&s;erved for Ran&s;om; all the Invaders, between four and five hundred, were, according to the Deputy's po&s;itive Command, put to the Sword; and the Country was thus weeded of the&s;e noxious Foreigners. As for <HI>Ra|legh,</HI> he never was taxed, that I can learn, with any Cruelty upon this Account, more than <HI>Mack|worth,</HI> or the re&s;t of the Officers.</P>
<P><HI>Ralegh</HI> was quartered this Winter at <HI>Cork,</HI> where he ob&s;erved the &s;editious Practices of <HI>David</HI> Lord <HI>Barry, Patrick Condon,</HI> and other Ringleaders of the Rebellion in tho&s;e Parts, to di&s;tre&s;s &s;o into|lerably tho&s;e Subjects who were peacefully inclined, and foment the di&s;affected to an In&s;urrection; that he was forced to take a Journey in Per&s;on to the Lord Deputy at <HI>Dublin;</HI> where he remon&s;trated the dangerous Con&s;equences he fore&s;aw, &s;o urgent|ly, that, the Ca&s;e being taken into Con&s;ideration by his Lord&s;hip and the Council, they return'd him with a full Commi&s;&s;ion to enter upon the Ca&s;tle called <HI>Barry-Court,</HI> with all other Lands of the &s;aid <HI>Barry,</HI> and to reduce him to Peace and Sub|jection, by &s;uch Means as he judg'd mo&s;t fea&s;ible; appointing him for his farther Enablement a Party
<PB N="33" REF="34">
of Hor&s;e. In the Interim, &s;uch Mea&s;ures were u&s;ed with tho&s;e in Authority at <HI>Cork,</HI> that the Commi&s;&s;ion proved of little Effect; but though the &s;aid E&s;tate of <HI>Barry-More,</HI> was made over to the Mother of <HI>David Barry,</HI> and only rented to the Son; and though it was his principal Seat; yet partly in Fear of that Commi&s;&s;ion, partly through Spite and Indignation, he burnt the Ca&s;tle him&s;elf to the Ground, and wa&s;ted the Country about it with greater Outrage and De&s;truction, than his Enemies, had they taken it, would have done. Moreover, as <HI>Ralegh</HI> was on his Journey back to his Quarters, an old Rebel of <HI>Barry</HI>'s Faction, named <HI>Fitz-Edmonds,</HI> and his Crew &s;allied from their Ambu&s;cade, and cro&s;s'd him, to oppo&s;e his Pa&s;&s;age, whom <HI>Ralegh</HI> manfully encountered and defeated, or at lea&s;t broke thro' them, &s;o that he got clear over the River; but one of his Company, Mr. <HI>Henry Mole,</HI> following, his Hor&s;e foundering, threw him down in the Middle of it; where, be|tween Fear of drowning and being taken by the Enemies, he called out to <HI>Ralegh</HI> for Help; who, tho' he had e&s;caped both Dangers, yet incurred them again to &s;ave his Companion's Life; but <HI>Moyle,</HI> in Ha&s;te and Confu&s;ion remounting, over|leap'd his Hor&s;e, and fell down on the other Side into a deep Mire, where he might have been &s;tifled, had not <HI>Ralegh</HI> recovered him a &s;econd Time, and brought him &s;afe to Land; but his Hor&s;e run over to the Rebels. <HI>Ralegh</HI> waited on the oppo&s;ite Bank, with his Staff <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e Staves were not &s;hort like Truncheons, but rather like Poles, or Watermen's Stretchers, though not &s;o long or clum&s;ily made; for being headed at one End with a &s;harp Point or Pile of Iron, they might be u&s;ed for Defence, or Offence, ei|ther as Quarter &s;taves, or Spears.</NOTE>in one Hand, and a Pi&s;tol in the other, for the re&s;t of his Company who were

yet to cro&s;s the River; among whom was his Ser|vant <HI>Jenkin,</HI> who had two hundred Pounds of his Money in Charge; a Sum in tho&s;e Days enough to make a Soldier of Fortune in the&s;e Circum&s;tances look about him; e&s;pecially now <HI>Fitz Edmonds</HI> had got a Recruit of twelve Men, and was in all above twenty &s;trong again&s;t him. Yet this Hero, as his Party called him, when he beheld <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;tand his Ground, and the re&s;t of his Company advance, whom he po&s;&s;ibly thought might be of greater Number than they were, only exchanged a few rough Words with him, and thought it be&s;t to offer no further Mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>Soon after the Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI> departed from his long and weari&s;ome Services here to <HI>England,</HI> about the Spring of the Year 1581. His Government of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> was given to Captain <HI>Ralegh,</HI> in Commi&s;|&s;ion with Sir <HI>William Morgan</HI> and Captain <HI>Piers. Ralegh</HI> lay for the mo&s;t Part at <HI>Li&s;more;</HI> and, in the Country and Woods thereabouts, &s;pent all this Summer in continual Action again&s;t the Re|bels.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Ralegh</HI> removed with his little Band of four&s;core Foot and eight Hor&s;e, to his old Quar|ters at <HI>Cork;</HI> but receiving Intelligence by the Way, that the Arch-traitor <HI>Barry</HI> was at <HI>Clove,</HI> with &s;everal hundred Men, he re&s;olved to pa&s;s through that Town, and offer him the Combat. Accordingly at the Town's End he met <HI>Barry</HI> and his Forces, whom <HI>Ralegh</HI> charged with great Bravery, and put him to Flight. As he pur&s;ued his Journey, he overtook another Company of the Enemy in a Plain, by a Wood-&s;ide; upon whom, having only &s;ix Hor&s;emen with him, expecting probably his Company would &s;oon join him, he gave the On&s;et; but the Rebels, who were in much greater Number, being cut off from the Wood, and
<PB N="35" REF="36">
having no other Relief, faced about, and fought very de&s;perately, killing five of the Hor&s;es belong|ing to <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Company, whereof his own was one, and he him&s;elf very near being over-borne by the Numbers upon him, had not his tru&s;ty Servant <HI>Nicholas Wright,</HI> a <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Man, interpos'd; who perceiving his Ma&s;ter's Hor&s;e &s;o mortally wounded with Darts, and plunging pa&s;t all Re|covery, encounter'd &s;ix of the Enemy at once, and killed one of them; while another of his Fellow|&s;ervants, named <HI>Patrick Fagaw,</HI> re&s;cued <HI>Ralegh;</HI> which had been &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sfully attempted by <HI>James Fitz-Richard</HI> and his Kern, both of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Com|pany, that the Man was &s;lain, and the Ma&s;ter very near the &s;ame Fate; whereupon <HI>Ralegh</HI> would not &s;uffer <HI>Wright</HI> to fight by him any longer, but or|dered him <HI>to charge above hand, and &s;ave the Gentleman:</HI> At which Command he ru&s;h'd into the Throng of the Enemy, di&s;patch'd the Antagoni&s;t who pre&s;s'd fore&s;t upon Mr. <HI>Fitz-Richard,</HI> and re&s;cued him. In this &s;harp Skirmi&s;h, there were many of the Rebels &s;lain, and two taken Pri&s;oners, whom <HI>Ralegh</HI> carried with him to <HI>Cork;</HI> and while he lay here, he performed &s;everal other no|table Services, which de&s;erve to be for ever re|gi&s;ter'd.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t, his excellent Conduct in the Seizure of the Lord <HI>Roch</HI> is more particularly re|member'd and applauded. This Nobleman, being much &s;u&s;pected to hold Confederacy with &s;ome of the chief Rebels, <HI>Ralegh</HI> undertook to bring, with his Family, before the Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI> at <HI>Cork.</HI> But the De&s;ign of this hazardous Surpri&s;e took Air among the Enemy, and a Party of 800 Men, un|der <HI>Fitz-Edmonds</HI> and <HI>Barry,</HI> were gather'd to way-lay the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> either going or coming. How|ever <HI>Ralegh,</HI> knowing the Lord <HI>Roch</HI> to be a
<PB N="36" REF="37">
powerful and popular Man among the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> &s;o &s;uddenly commanded all his Company to be in Readine&s;s by Eleven a-Clock that Night, and they were &s;o punctual to the Hour, that he directly marched away to <HI>Bally</HI> in <HI>Har&s;h,</HI> which was <HI>Roch</HI>'s Seat, about twenty Miles from <HI>Cork,</HI> and e&s;caped the Ambu&s;cade. He arrived there by Break of Day; but the Town&s;men were &s;o alarmed, that they &s;oon gathered 500 &s;trong. <HI>Ralegh</HI> drew up, and in &s;uch Manner be&s;towed his Men in the Town it &s;elf, that he &s;oon quell'd and re&s;train'd the People there; then &s;electing half a Dozen out of his Company; and having appointed another little Party to follow him, he marched up to the Ca&s;tle. He was met by three or four of <HI>Roch</HI>'s Gentlemen, of whom he de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with their Lord; which was agreed to, on Condition he would di&s;mi&s;s three or four of his own Attendants; to which, with apparent Readine&s;s, he comply'd; but &s;o contrived, that none of them were locked out. Then he gave them Directions which Way the re&s;t al&s;o, without the Gates, might be admitted, whil&s;t he &s;hould hold the Lord <HI>Roch</HI> in Di&s;cour&s;e; which &s;ucceeded &s;o happily, that by Degrees his whole Compliment were got within the Court-yard, &s;ome guarding the Gates, others watching in the Hall, each having his Piece loaden with a Brace of Balls. The Lord <HI>Roch</HI> was amaz'd and terrify'd at &s;o &s;ilent and in&s;en&s;ible a Seizure; but, di&s;&s;embling his Unea&s;ine&s;s, he would needs have <HI>Ralegh,</HI> and the Gentlemen with him, participate of his plenti|ful Table; yet the Policy of his Ho&s;pitality did not defeat that of their Enterpri&s;e; for, as &s;oon as the Dinner was over, <HI>Ralegh</HI> ingenuou&s;ly laid open the Occa&s;ion of his Vi&s;it. Lord <HI>Roch</HI> made many Excu&s;es, and in the End ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to go along with him. But when the Commi&s;&s;ion was
<PB N="37" REF="38">
produced, and he found <HI>Ralegh</HI> inflexible, he cho&s;e to do that by Con&s;ent, which he found he mu&s;t do by Compul&s;ion. Then <HI>Ralegh</HI> urged him to oblige his Town&s;men likewi&s;e, who had &s;o faithfully ri&s;en for his Defence in his Neighbourhood, to e&s;cort and defend him in his Journey; to which Lord <HI>Roch</HI> al&s;o con&s;ented, profe&s;&s;ing he doubted not but to clear him&s;elf of whatever Allegations &s;hould be laid to his Charge. When his Lord&s;hip, with his Lady and Attendants, had made them&s;elves ready, <HI>Ralegh</HI> was for another nocturnal Progre&s;s; but though the Night fell out &s;o very dark and tem|pe&s;tuous, and the Ways were &s;o full of Hills and Dales, Rocks and Precipices, that many of his Sol|diers were much brui&s;ed by Falls, and one of them &s;o mortify'd, that he lo&s;t his Life in the March; yet the Veil wherewith the re&s;t were &s;helter'd, by that Ob&s;curity, from the more dangerous Ambu&s;|cades of their Enemy, who had every where be|&s;trew'd the Pa&s;&s;ages to intercept them, made &s;uch &s;ufficient Compen&s;ation for tho&s;e Di&s;a&s;ters, that by the next Morning early he &s;afely pre&s;ented his Pri|&s;oners to the General, not without rai&s;ing an uni|ver&s;al A&s;toni&s;hment at his dexterous Eva&s;ion of &s;o many Perils. But the Lord <HI>Roch,</HI> upon Exa|mination being honourably acquitted, he approved him&s;elf a faithful Subject ever after, and three of his Sons laid down their Lives in her Maje&s;ty's Service.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the &s;ame Year, the Lord Deputy made the afore&s;aid Captain <HI>John Zouch</HI> Governor of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> with whom <HI>Ralegh</HI> and <HI>Dowdal</HI> made &s;everal Journeys to &s;ettle and compo&s;e the Country; but the certain Place of their Re&s;idence was at <HI>Cork.</HI> And when <HI>Zouch,</HI> with <HI>Dowdal,</HI> made that &s;ecret Expedition, in which he lopp'd off the third Branch of this veno|mous

<P><HI>Ralegh</HI> was not long in <HI>England,</HI>  before his Re|lation in &s;ome Degree to the Court began to ap|pear. Tradition has indu&s;triou&s;ly ab&s;crib'd his fir&s;t Introduction thither to a Piece of Gallantry, wherewith he &s;urpris'd the Queen accidentally in one of her Walks. <HI>Her Maje&s;ty meeting (&s;ays my Author) with a pla&s;hy Place, made &s;ome Scruple to go on; when Ralegh (dre&s;s'd in the gay and genteel Habit of tho&s;e Times) pre&s;ently ca&s;t off and &s;pread his new Plu&s;h-cloak on the Ground, whereon the Queen trod gently over, rewarding him afterwards with many Suits for his &s;o free and &s;ea&s;onable Tender of &s;o fair a</HI> Foot-cloth: <HI>Thus an advantageous Admi&s;&s;ion into the Notice of a Prince, is more than half a De|gree to Preferment.</HI> After this, Ralegh coming to Court, and finding &s;ome Hopes of the Queen's Favour reflecting upon him, he wrote in a Gla&s;s Window, obvious to her Eye,
<Q><L>Fain would I climb, yet fear I to fall.</L></Q></P>

So that if the Earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> who was

Not that he &s;et out to Sea, but when he had de|&s;paired of rai&s;ing him&s;elf on Shore; for the&s;e pub|lick Enterprizes were rooted &s;o early in <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s a&s;|piring Mind, that we perceive, even now, before Factions at Court could drive him from the Land, or Preferments and Grants from the Crown enable him for the Sea; that he had built at his own Ex|pence, to pro&s;ecute them, a &s;trong hand&s;ome Ship, which was named <HI>Bark Ralegh,</HI> of two hun|dred Ton Burden.</P>
<P>And now that the &s;ix Years Period of Sir <HI>Hum|phrey Gilbert</HI>'s Patent grew &s;hort, four of them be|ing elaps'd, he thought it high Time to make a new Attempt in Per&s;on (&s;ince his A&s;&s;ignments had proved of little Con&s;equence) at tho&s;e Di&s;coveries he had before fail'd in, that he might confirm by Experience what he had &s;o excellently advanced in Theory.

<P>And as we are a&s;&s;ured from Family Tradition, by a late Author of his own Name and Lineage, that the Di&s;coveries of the great <HI>Columbus,</HI> the Conque&s;ts of <HI>Fernando Cortez,</HI> the famous <HI>Francis Pizarro,</HI> and other Leaders of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who under the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> and his Son <HI>Philip</HI> II. had made the greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing Addi|tions to their Empire that ever Prince received, or Subjects wrought, were the favourite Hi&s;tories that took up <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s early Reading and Conver&s;ation while he was but a young Man; we may pre&s;ume they &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his noble Genius (with perhaps al&s;o &s;ome late dome&s;tic and living Examples) that no little per&s;onal Oppo&s;itions at Home, or particular Mi&s;adventures Abroad, could ever di&s;courage him from the Pur&s;uit of the&s;e grand and national Un|dertakings. But when, by his own Ob&s;ervation, he found the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had only &s;ettled upon the middle and &s;outhern Parts of <HI>America,</HI> and that there were certain va&s;t Territories yet unknown to the North of tho&s;e Lands, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> already enjoyed, as fit perhaps for Settlement, and as ea&s;y to conquer, as any they did enjoy: And when, by his Enquiries, among the mo&s;t ob&s;ervant Pilots and Mariners who had &s;ailed in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship to the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> many of whom he had Opportunity to meet and di&s;cour&s;e with in
<PB N="47" REF="48">
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> he had learnt that the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> always went into the Gulph of <HI>Mexico</HI> by <HI>St. Domingo</HI> and the I&s;land of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> where the Currents with the Trade-winds always ran together, and &s;et into the Bay; that they always di&s;em|bogu'd, as they called it, or came out by the <HI>Ha|vana</HI> and the Channels of <HI>Bahama,</HI> which they now call the Gulph of <HI>Florida;</HI> and that, as they return|ed by this Gulph, they found a continued Coa&s;t on the We&s;t Side trending away North, which they generally lo&s;t Sight of by &s;tanding away to the Ea&s;t, to make for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain; Ralegh</HI> fully de|termined that there was a va&s;t Extent of Land North of that Gulph, or We&s;t from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> which might be well worth di&s;covering; and, after mature Deliberation, fully re&s;olved upon the Di&s;covery. As &s;oon as he had dige&s;ted his Propo&s;al, and di&s;played the Manner of pro&s;ecuting it in proper Schemes, he laid them before the Queen and Council, to whom it appearing a ra|tional, practical, and generous Undertaking, her Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed in the Beginning of the Year 1584, to grant him full Power to enjoy &s;uch Countries as he propo&s;ed to di&s;cover, by her Let|ters Patents.</P>

<PB N="48" REF="49">
from the We&s;t of <HI>England.</HI> The 10th of <HI>May</HI> they arrived at the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and a Month after fell upon the I&s;les of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies, which, with the Re&s;t adjoining (&s;ays my Author, one of tho&s;e Captains) are &s;o well known to your&s;elf (directing the Account of this Voyage to his Proprietor) and to many others, that I will not trouble you with the Remembrance of them.</HI> In the Beginning of <HI>July</HI> they were &s;aluted with a mo&s;t fragrant Gale from the Land they were &s;eeking, and &s;oon after arrived upon the Coa&s;t; but &s;ailed along &s;ome &s;ix-&s;core Miles before they could find an Entrance by any River i&s;&s;uing into the Sea. At la&s;t, di&s;covering one, they manned out their Boats to view the Land adjoining, where they &s;aw Vines laden with Grapes in va&s;t Abundance, climbing up the tall Cedars, and &s;preading &s;o luxu|riantly along the &s;andy Shore, that the Sea often over-flowed them. On the 13th of <HI>July</HI> they took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in Right of the Queen, and afterwards delivered the Country over to <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s U&s;e.

the third, they &s;aw a Boat rowing towards them with three of the Natives; one of them landed, and walked up the Shore near their Ship, for they were then on Board; then the two Captains, with &s;ome others, took their Boat and rowed to Land, and by their courteous Carriage, &s;oon prevailed on the Native to return with them on Board, where they cloathed him, and gave him Victuals, Wine, and &s;everal little Toys or Uten&s;ils, which won the &s;imple Creature's Heart. Soon after his Departure he returned again with a Boat full of Fi&s;h, to be divided between the Ship and the Pinnace, and then he left them. The next Day came the King's Brother <HI>Granganimeo,</HI> with a great many Atten|dants; for the King him&s;elf, who was named <HI>Win|gina,</HI> and his large Territories <HI>Wingandacoa,</HI> lay ill of the Wounds he had lately received in War. His Brother was highly plea&s;ed with his Entertain|ment, and having received &s;everal Pre&s;ents, &s;oon after &s;ent the Savages to traffick with the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> al&s;o came again him&s;elf, and exchanged 20 Skins, worth as many Nobles, for a Tin Di&s;h, which he hung as a Gorget about his Neck, to defend him from the Arrows of his Enemies: Then al&s;o he brought his Wife and Children, with her Atten|dants 40 or 50 in Number. She was well-favour'd, but ba&s;hful, clad in a Mantle of Deer-&s;kin, lined with Fur, and a Kind of Apron of the &s;ame, her Hair hung down long on each Side, with a Band of white Coral about her Forehead, and long Brace|lets of Pearl down to her Middle, as big as Pea&s;e in her Ears, <HI>a Bracelet whereof, we delivered to your wor&s;hip,</HI> &s;ays my Author to <HI>Ralegh.</HI> Her Hu&s;|band's Apparel was much like hers, only about his Head he wore a broad Plate of Gold or Copper, and his Hair was long but on one Side. After this Interview, familiar Commerce pa&s;&s;ed between

the Natives and the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who, when they went to <HI>Roanoak,</HI> were much care&s;s'd and treated by the Lady afore&s;aid. And when &s;he could not prevail with them to &s;tay, being but few in Company, though the Natives had no Edge-tools of Iron or Steel, and had proffered a great Box of Pearl for &s;ome Armour and a Sword, &s;he &s;ent her Women to watch them all Night in their Ships on the Bank|&s;ide. And indeed all the People, who &s;aw them, admired much at their Ships, their Fire-arms, their Cloaths, and above all, their Complexions; for, except a Ve&s;&s;el which was ca&s;t away with &s;ome chri&s;tian Adventurers about 26 Years before near <HI>Secotan,</HI> the &s;outhermo&s;t Town in <HI>Wingandacoa,</HI> never any People in Apparel, or of fair Colour were &s;een or heard of among them; which made them wonder &s;o much at the Whitene&s;s of their Skins, and &s;o fond of &s;eeing and touching them. Under the&s;e favourable Recommendations, and the Di&s;tre&s;s which the Natives were in for &s;ome power|ful Friends to defend them from the Inva&s;ions of their Neighbours, the Promi&s;es of vi&s;iting them again, wherewith the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> left them, after having learnt as much of the Situation, State and Product of the Country, as was at this Time con|venient, were very acceptable. So bringing over a Couple of the <HI>Indians</HI> with them, named <HI>Manteo</HI> and <HI>Wanche&s;e,</HI> to &s;hew them our fine Country, they arrived &s;afely in the We&s;t of <HI>England</HI> about the Middle of <HI>September</HI> following.</P>
<P>When <HI>Ralegh</HI> had laid before her Maje&s;ty the&s;e and all other Reports mo&s;t worthy of Notice, of this rich, beautiful and Virgin Country; and had acknowledged how much this hopeful Progre&s;s to|wards the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it was owing to the Au&s;pices of a Virgin Queen; &s;he was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the Honour and Advantage it promi&s;ed, and gave

him &s;uch Encouragement to compleat the Di&s;|covery, which he forthwith prepared to do by ano|ther Expedition, that &s;he called it her&s;elf by the Name of <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>About two Months after, he was elected a Knight of the Shire for the County of <HI>Devon,</HI> Sir <HI>William Courtenay</HI> being the other Repre&s;entative. There was then a Clerk of the Parliament &s;o very indolent, or otherwi&s;e indi&s;po&s;ed, that the Tran&s;|actions of the Hou&s;e of Commons at this Time were very imperfectly recorded. Yet we find <HI>Ra|legh</HI> mentioned to have been cho&s;en of the Com|mittees upon &s;ome Bills that were then read. On the 14th of <HI>December</HI> following, the Bill, in Con|firmation of his Patent afore&s;aid for the Di&s;covery of Foreign Countries, was read the fir&s;t Time. In the Afternoon it was read the &s;econd Time, and committed to the Vice-chamberlain <HI>Hatton,</HI> Secre|tary <HI>Wal&s;ingham,</HI> Sir <HI>Philip Sidney,</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Greenfield</HI> (or <HI>Grenvill),</HI> Sir <HI>William Courtenay,</HI> Sir <HI>William Mohun,</HI> and others. Three Days after the &s;aid Bill was, without any Alteration, ordered to be engro&s;&s;ed. The next Day it was read the third Time, when it pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e. Between this Time and the 24th of <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> following he received the Honour of Knight|hood; for being then in a Committee for con&s;ider|ing after what Manner and Mea&s;ure they &s;hould &s;upply her Maje&s;ty by Sub&s;idy: This is the earlie&s;t Time I meet with of his being &s;tiled Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh;</HI> a Title which her Maje&s;ty be&s;towed, as all others of Honour, with Frugality and Choice.

But his too favourable Dealing with them had given &s;uch Encouragement, as, that, intending further to di|&s;turb the Bearer, they had warned him to appear before them; with which he had per&s;uaded him to comply. Upon their &s;ending no An&s;wer to this, and <HI>Ralegh</HI> hearing they had &s;uddenly clapped up the Man in Pri&s;on, he &s;ent 10 Days after the la&s;t, his third Letter from the Court, directed <HI>To the Vice-chancellor, and the re&s;t of the Ma&s;ters,</HI> &amp;c.

That they had not neglected any rea&s;onable Means to procure his Favour for the quiet Enjoyment of that whereof they had the Fruition for above two hun|dred Years; nor omitted to become Petitioners to him in a very humble Manner.

That her Maje&s;ty's Grant, by her Prerogative, gave him his Title; and the like Prerogative was the Ground of their Charters.

<P>An End having been put to the <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> Rebel|lion by Force of Arms, and the Country further laid de&s;olate by a raging Famine, which devour'd what the Sword had left, except a few who re|mained in Cities, fled to <HI>England,</HI> or could feed upon Weeds and Carrion, &s;o as even to rob the Graves and the Gibbets of the Dead, to keep the dying alive; the Queen &s;oon became de&s;irous of repeopling the Country, and to have Ways con|&s;ider'd&punc; on, how the late Earl of <HI>De&s;mond</HI>'s large Territories in <HI>Ireland</HI> might be di&s;po&s;ed of to the Advantage of her and her Subjects.

Hereupon <HI>Drake</HI> readily proffer'd them all Manner of Supplies, by Vic|tuals, Men, Ammunition, and Ships, to carry on and compleat their worthy Undertaking. The Go|vernor de&s;ired only a Ship, and &s;o much Provi&s;ion as about <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> would carry him and his Company to <HI>England,</HI> which <HI>Drake</HI> granted in full Suffi|ciency; be&s;ides Pinnaces, Boats, and two expe|rienced Ma&s;ters or Pilots, to abide with them, and apply them&s;elves earne&s;tly in the Action. All this was performed in two Days. On the next Day,

<P>But pa&s;&s;ing over the&s;e Tales; as <HI>Ralegh</HI> was the fir&s;t, who brought this Herb in Reque&s;t among us, and laid the Foundation for that great Traffick therewith, which has been of &s;uch con&s;iderable Be|nefit to his Country; there is no le&s;s Honour due to him than has been conferred on that Amba&s;&s;ador, who had before brought it out of <HI>Portugal</HI> into <HI>France;</HI> where, in mentioning the Herb, they pay grateful Acknowledgments to the Importer, by calling it <HI>Nicotiana,</HI> after his own Name: Nay, his politick Sovereign <HI>Catherine de Medicis,</HI> did &s;o zealou&s;ly encourage the U&s;e of it, that it was al&s;o afterwards in Honour of her called the <HI>Queen's Herb.</HI> Nor was the Queen of <HI>England</HI> backward in li&s;tening to, and promoting the Advantages it was promi&s;ed to produce.

<P><HI>I remember to have met with a &s;carce old Tract in the</HI> Lambeth <HI>Library, written by a learned and ingenious Author of tho&s;e Times; he adds:</HI> Yet you, more re&s;pecting the good Ends whereunto you le|velled your Line for the Good of your Country, did not give over 'till you had recovered a Land, and had made a Plantation of the People of your own <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Nation in <HI>Virginia,</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colony that was ever planted there; not a little to the Deroga|tion of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Glory and Impeachment to their Vaunts, who, becau&s;e, with all cruel Immanity, they &s;ubdued a naked and yielding People, whom they &s;ought for Gain, and not for Religion or the Planta|tion of a Common-wealth, over whom, to &s;atisfy their in&s;atiable Covetou&s;ne&s;s, they did mo&s;t cruelly tyranni&s;e, and again&s;t the Cour&s;e of all human Nature &s;corch and roa&s;t them to Death, as by their own Hi&s;tories doth appear.

But if the&s;e your Actions were well looked into and with due Con&s;ideration, it &s;hall be found much more honourable in &s;undry Re&s;pects for the Advance|ment of the Name of God, the Honour of the Prince, and the Benefit of the Common-wealth. For what can be more plea&s;ant to God, than to gain and reduce, in all Chri&s;tian-like Manner, a lo&s;t People to the Knowledge of the Go&s;pel and a true Chri&s;tian Reli|gion, than which cannot be a more plea&s;ant and &s;weet Sacrifice, and a more acceptable Service before God? And what can be more honourable to Princes, than to enlarge the Bounds of their Kingdoms, without In|jury, Wrong and Blood&s;hed, and to frame them from a &s;avage Life to a civil Government, neither of which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in their Conque&s;ts have performed? And what can be more beneficial to a Common-wealth, than to have a Nation and a Kingdom to transfer un|to, the &s;uperfluous Multitude of fruitle&s;s and idle People (here, at Home, daily increa&s;ing) to travel, conquer, and manure another Land, which, by the due Intercour&s;es to be devi&s;ed, may and will yield in|finite Commodities?

But the Ships, in which this &s;econd Colony was tran&s;ported, had not been many Days returned into <HI>England,</HI> before we find <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Thoughts di|verted, for a while, from planting in a foreign Country, and engaged upon Schemes of di&s;planting rather tho&s;e powerful Enemies who were preparing to root them&s;elves in his own. For the Rumour grew &s;tronger every Day of &s;uch a mighty Fleet threatning us, as if all <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> were to land upon our little I&s;land, and over-run the whole King|dom. The Queen and her Privy-council therefore no longer delayed all proper Means for the De|fence of the Realm; but out of all her Com|manders by Land and Sea appointed tho&s;e of mo&s;t approved Abilities in naval and military Affairs, as well as of the greate&s;t Authority in their re&s;pective Counties, to hold Con&s;ultations for the Security of her Per&s;on, her People, and their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.

<P>Be&s;ides this grand Scheme for the Safeguard of the Kingdom in general, <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;eems to have had &s;ome &s;pecial Regard to &s;everal particular Places.

We may indeed hence believe this Paper was written by him; and that he not only took tho&s;e Places, but &s;everal others, under his Con&s;ideration, that they might be put in the be&s;t State of Defence; but that he was now Gover|nor of <HI>Portland</HI> Ca&s;tle, or limited to the Defence

<P>But as much engaged as <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;eems at this Time to have been for the Safety of the Kingdom, he found &s;ome Interval to con&s;ider al&s;o upon Means for the Relief of his Colony; for after Governor <HI>White</HI> returned, and had delivered him his Letters, with other Adverti&s;ements concerning his late Voyage, and the State of the Planters in <HI>Virginia, Ralegh</HI> immediately appointed a Pinnace to be &s;ent thither, with all &s;uch Provi&s;ions as he apprehended they might want; and al&s;o wrote Letters to them, promi&s;ing that he would prepare a good Supply of Shipping and Men, with all other Nece&s;&s;aries, to be with them the Summer following. This Pin|nace and Fleet he accordingly prepared at <HI>Biddeford</HI> in the We&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> under the Command of Sir <HI>Richard Greenvil;</HI> and all Things being now ready, they waited only for a fair Wind.

over the Bar at <HI>Biddeford,</HI> and the &s;ame Night came to Anchor at the I&s;le of <HI>Lundy;</HI> but the Company, minding more to make a gainful Voyage than a &s;afe one, run in Cha&s;e of Prizes; 'till at la&s;t one of them was met with by a Couple of &s;trong Men of War of <HI>Rochelle,</HI> about 50 Leagues to the North-Ea&s;t of <HI>Madera;</HI> where, after a bloody Fight, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were beaten, boarded and rifled.

In this maimed, ran&s;acked and ragged Condition, the &s;aid Ship returned to <HI>England</HI> in a Month's Time; and about three Weeks after returned the other, having perhaps ta&s;ted of the &s;ame Fare; at lea&s;t without performing the intended Voyage; to the Di&s;tre&s;s of the Planters abroad, and Di&s;plea&s;ure of their Patron at home.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;ent Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> a Me&s;&s;age, a&s;&s;uring her, that the Tem|pe&s;t, which had been gathering in <HI>Spain</HI> for three Years, would certainly break very &s;peedily upon her Kingdom; therefore advi&s;ed her to make the be&s;t Preparation &s;he could for its Defence.

Then the Lord-admiral in the <HI>Ark-Royal, Drake</HI> in the <HI>Revenge,</HI> with <HI>Hawkins, Frobi&s;her,</HI> and others, having thunder'd thick upon the Enemy for two Hours together, withdrew, 40 of their Ships not being yet come up. In this En|gagement the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by endeavouring to circle in and &s;helter one of their di&s;abled Galleons, &s;he had her Forema&s;t broken, and was left behind, which <HI>Drake</HI> took the next Day, with <HI>Don Pedro de Valdez</HI> and other Nobles in her, be&s;ides 55000 Ducats, which were &s;hared among his Sailors.

And this was now no le&s;s advi&s;edly done with regard to him&s;elf, than af|fectionately with re&s;pect to the People employ'd therein: Whom, though he generou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted with his Advice and Intere&s;t in &s;ome future Pro&s;e|cutions of this Undertakings; yet the&s;e proving impro&s;perous, through the oblique Cour&s;es they took at fir&s;t &s;etting out upon this new Foundation, like that in which they lately fail'd, it was twenty Years from this Time, before even a whole Com|pany could make a more &s;ucce&s;sful and advanced P ogre&s;s in this Settlement, than Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> of him&s;elf alone had done; it having co&s;t him no le&s;s than 40000<HI>l.</HI></P>

<L>Of the green Alders by the <HI>Mulla</HI>'s Shore;</L>
<L>There a &s;trange Shepherd chanc'd to find me out,</L>
<L>Whether allured with my Pipe's Delight,</L>
<L>Who&s;e plea&s;ing Sound y&s;hrilled far about,</L>
<L>Or thither led by Chance, I knew not right,</L>
<L><PB N="104" REF="105">
Whom when I a&s;ked from what Place he came,</L>
<L>And how he hight? him&s;elf he did ycleep</L>
<L>The Shepherd of the Ocean <HI>by Name,</HI></L>
<L>And &s;aid, he came <HI>far from the Main-&s;ea</HI> deep.</L>
<L>He &s;itting me be&s;ide in that &s;ame Shade,</L>
<L>Provoked me to play &s;ome plea&s;ant Fit;</L>
<L>And when he heard the Mu&s;ick that I made,</L>
<L>He found him&s;elf full greatly pleas'd at it:</L>
<L>Yet aemuling my Pipe, he took in Hond</L>
<L>My Pipe, before that aemuled of many,</L>
<L>And play'd thereon, for well that Skill he con'd;</L>
<L>Him&s;elf as &s;kilful in that Art as any.</L>
</LG>
<P>It further appears, they now entertain'd each other with &s;ome of their poetical Compo&s;itions; <HI>Spen&s;er</HI> rehear&s;ed a pretty Tale he had made of the Amours between &s;ome of his neighbouring Rivers; but <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Mu&s;e ran upon a more melancholy Strain, which, by the tran&s;ient View it gives of &s;ome little Cloud he had lately, but unde&s;ervedly, been under at Court, lets us into a Piece of his &s;e|cret Hi&s;tory; where the Poet tells us,</P>
<LG>
<L>His Song was all a lamentable Lay,</L>
<L>Of great Unkindne&s;s and of U&s;age hard,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Cynthia</HI> the Lady of the Sea,</L>
<L>Which from her Pre&s;ence, faultle&s;s, him debarr'd:</L>
<L>And ever and anon with <HI>Singults</HI> rife,</L>
<L>He cried out to make his under&s;ong,</L>
<L>Ah my Love's Queen, and Godde&s;s of my Life!</L>
<L>Who &s;hall me pity, when thou do&s;t me Wrong?</L>
</LG>
<P>But it immediately appears to have been &s;oon blown over by &s;ome pathetical Addre&s;s of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s to the Queen, whereby he was, at this Time, re|&s;tored
<PB N="105" REF="106">
to her Favour, as we may fully conclude from the&s;e Words:</P>
<LG>
<L>&mdash;Right well be &s;ure did' plain,</L>
<L>That could great <HI>Cynthia's</HI> &s;ore Di&s;plea&s;ure break,</L>
<L>And move to take him to her Grace again.</L>
</LG>
<P>And this is confirmed a little further, where, through <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Affection for his Welfare, and his Regret to behold &s;o rare a Genius bani&s;hed to a De|&s;art, and buried in &s;uch a State of Ob&s;curity, he per&s;uades <HI>Spen&s;er</HI> to go along with him into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and proffers to introduce him to the Queen. The Poet, knowing his Intere&s;t, embraced his Offer. Then having given a De&s;cription of the Sea, with <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s great Ship, &s;uitable to the Sim|plicity of the Character he a&s;&s;umes; and having repre&s;ented <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s De&s;cription of the Flocks and Herds of that <HI>Royal Shepherde&s;s,</HI> which were kept upon tho&s;e watry Hills, under the Charge of <HI>Triton</HI> and <HI>Proteus,</HI> he makes him further &s;ay:</P>
<LG>
<L>And I among the re&s;t, of many lea&s;t,</L>
<L>Have in the Ocean Charge to me a&s;&s;ign'd;</L>
<L>Where I will live or die at her Behea&s;t,</L>
<L>And &s;erve and honour her with faithful Mind.</L>
</LG>
<P>He then proceeds to the Progre&s;s of their Voyage, how they pa&s;&s;ed by the <HI>I&s;le of Lundy,</HI> and landed at St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s <HI>Mount</HI> in <HI>Cornwall;</HI> &s;o took their Journey to the Court, where the Poet having expa|tiated on the dazling Pre&s;ence of the Queen, agree|able to the Admiration of a Spectator, in his pa&s;to|ral Character, we have this further Acknowledg|ment.</P>
<LG>
<L>The Shepherd of the Ocean, <HI>quoth he,</HI></L>
<L>Unto the Godde&s;s<HI>'s</HI> Grace me fir&s;t enhanced:</L>
<L><PB N="106" REF="107">
And to my oaten Pipe inclined her Ear,</L>
<L>That &s;he thenceforth therein 'gan take Delight,</L>
<L>And it de&s;ired, at timely Hours to hear;</L>
<L>All were my Notes but rude and roughly dight.</L>
</LG>
<P>This Honour the Poet further magnifies, as the more wond'rous Conde&s;cen&s;ion in her Maje&s;ty, in that &s;he had &s;o many more learned Shepherds about her to glorify her Name. Here he takes an Op|portunity to give a Character of the &s;everal Poets and Wits then &s;hining in her Court: Among the re&s;t,</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>And there that</HI> Shepherd of the Ocean <HI>is,</HI></L>
<L>That &s;pends his Wit in Love's con&s;uming Smart:</L>
<L>Full &s;weetly temper'd is that Mu&s;e of his,</L>
<L>That can impierce a Prince's mighty Heart.</L>
</LG>
<P>As to <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s poetical Talents, we &s;hall hear more of them very &s;peedily. In this Place, we mu&s;t pur&s;ue his farther De&s;ign of bringing <HI>Spen&s;er</HI> over into <HI>England,</HI> which was to make him oblige the Publick with what he had hitherto fini&s;hed of his capital Work, called the <HI>Fairy Queen.</HI> For, though <HI>Spencer</HI> had begun this grand Poem through the Encouragement of Sir <HI>Philip Sidney,</HI> before he went over into <HI>Ireland;</HI> yet it was there he &s;eems to have writ mo&s;t of what we have in Print; and now, by the Encouragement of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> that he was brought to publi&s;h the three fir&s;t Books which he had compleated thereof: 'Tis certain he took his Advice in the Publication of them, and particularly in drawing up a Plan to explain or di&s;|cover the general Intention and Meaning of that al|legorical Poem. This he directed to his &s;aid Pa|tron, <HI>The right noble and valorous Sir</HI> Walter Ra|legh, &amp;c. in a letter dated the 23d of <HI>January</HI> this
<PB N="107" REF="108">
Year 1589; concluding with <HI>An humble Reque&s;t for the Continuance of his honourable Favours, and Wi&s;hes for the eternal E&s;tabli&s;hment of his Happine&s;s.</HI> This Letter is printed at the End of the &s;aid fir&s;t three Books of that Poem, which were publi&s;hed at <HI>London</HI> the en&s;uing Year. Among the com|mendatory Ver&s;es thereto al&s;o &s;ubjoined, the fir&s;t two Copies are both &s;aid to be written by Sir <HI>Wal|ter Raleigh,</HI> and not without great Probability, being &s;ub&s;cribed with the initial Letters of his Name. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Copies, written in al|ternate Ver&s;e, is highly poetical; for our Author, Corre&s;pondent with the vi&s;ionary Manner of his Author, fancying him&s;elf in the Temple of the ve&s;tal Virgins, where his Curio&s;ity led him to the Tomb of <HI>Laura,</HI> which was guarded by <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> he was &s;uddenly attracted from thence, by the Appearance of the <HI>Fairy Queen,</HI> at who&s;e Ap|proach the <HI>Soul of Petrarch wept;</HI> &s;eeing tho&s;e Graces de&s;ert that Mi&s;tre&s;s of his, to attend upon this royal Lady, and Oblivion &s;upply their Place. The Compliment is &s;urely fine, and perhaps the more judiciou&s;ly expre&s;s'd, in not being bounded more periodically than it is, according to the Doc|trine of our modern Criticks in the Structure of Ver&s;ification; for being the Recital of one &s;olemn and &s;urpri&s;ing Thought, it may engage our Atten|tion more clo&s;ely to the End of the two or three Quadrains it is compris'd in, than if the Author had affected to divide or bound the Sen&s;e with a full Period at the End of every four Lines. But every Reader may ea&s;ily judge for him&s;elf, the Poem be|ing in mo&s;t Editions of <HI>Spen&s;er,</HI> and therefore needs not here be recited. His other Ver&s;es upon this Poet are compo&s;ed in a Mea&s;ure more ob&s;olete to the Manner of our Age; but what the Queen her &s;elf imitated, in &s;ome Poetry &s;till to be &s;een of her

And, having adverti&s;ed the Poet that his Portraits are to be judged of or improved by the Originals of tho&s;e Virtues whereof he has compos'd his ficti|tious Queen, he very dexterou&s;ly transfers or appro|priates them to the real one then reigning: So con|cludes with a Compliment to him; which though of a very tran&s;cendent and ab&s;olute Nature, yet in Regard to the little good <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poetry then in being, and the great Fame of that Poet &s;till &s;ur|viving among us, is &s;till thought not more expre&s;|&s;ive of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s Affection, than his Judgment:
<Q><L>Of me no Lines are lov'd, nor Letters are of Price,</L>
<L>Of all that &s;peak the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, but tho&s;e of thy Device.</L></Q></P>
<P>We further ob&s;erve among the Copies of Ver&s;es in&s;cribed by <HI>Spen&s;er</HI> him&s;elf, at the End of his &s;aid <HI>Fairy Queen,</HI> to the &s;everal Mini&s;ters of State and Noblemen in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Court, one to the <HI>Noble and valorous Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh, &amp;c. as he again &s;tiles him: And this, becau&s;e it not only in|forms us what a favourite <HI>Ralegh</HI> was at this Time with the Queen; but al&s;o gives us Occa&s;ion to di|late upon his own poetical Productions a little

<P><HI>Hence we learn Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh <HI>wrote a Poem, call'd CYNTHIA; that it was in Prai&s;e of the Queen, and that it was not now publi&s;h'd.</HI> Spen&s;er, <HI>in his Letter to</HI> Ralegh <HI>above-cited, al&s;o mentions again &s;omething of this Poem, where he &s;ays,</HI> In that <HI>Fairy Queen,</HI> I mean <HI>Glory</HI> in my general In|tention; but in my Particular, I conceive the mo&s;t excellent and glorious Per&s;on of our Sovereign the <HI>Queen,</HI> and her Kingdom, in <HI>Fairy-land.</HI> And yet in &s;ome Places el&s;e, I do otherwi&s;e &s;hadow her.

This Bi&s;hop, he tells us, came to that See, among his other good Qualities, unreprovable for Simony, and in the Queen's good Opinion: If he had held on as clear as he enter'd, I &s;hould have highly extoll'd him, &s;ays our Author; but, continues he, &s;ee his Misfortune, which fir&s;t lo&s;t him the Queen's Favour, and after forced him to another Mi&s;chief. For being aged, di&s;ea&s;ed, and lame of the Gout, he married, as &s;ome thought, for Opinion of Wealth, a <HI>London</HI> Widow, his &s;e|cond Wife at lea&s;t: When a chief Favourite of that Time (whom he had named before in this Kind, and therefore thought by &s;ome, as perhaps it might be, Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh)</HI> had labour'd to get the Manor of <HI>Banwell</HI> from this Bi&s;hoprick; but di&s;daining the Repul&s;e, and hearing of this in|tempe&s;tive Marriage, he took Advantage thereof, caus'd it to be told the Queen (knowing how much &s;he mi&s;liked &s;uch Matches) and in&s;tantly pur&s;ued the Bi&s;hop with Letters and Mandates for the Ma|nor of <HI>Banwell</HI> for a hundred Years. The good Bi&s;hop, to pacify his Per&s;ecutors, and to &s;ave <HI>Ban|well,</HI> was fain to part with <HI>Wil&s;comb</HI> for 99 Years;
<PB N="116" REF="117">
and &s;o purcha&s;ed his Peace. And, as he did not hold on &s;o clear as he enter'd, it might be with Reference to the Simony before-mentioned; the Queen &s;aw it not unrea&s;onable, but e&s;pou&s;ed the Alienation; &s;o that it was her Gift. And the Bi|&s;hop's own Son, Dr. <HI>Francis Godwin,</HI> when he was Bi&s;hop al&s;o, and reviving his <HI>Catalogue of Bi&s;hops,</HI> in the next Reign. before <HI>Ralegh</HI> was out of Pri&s;on, makes no Complaint again&s;t him in the Account of his Father's Life; tho' he might &s;afely, if he could ju&s;tly, have done it, and <HI>Ralegh</HI> had been po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of that for which this Author's Father had not, ac|cording to the Cu&s;tom of tho&s;e Times, received Satisfaction. On the contrary, with much Mo|de&s;ty, rather laments that his Father &s;hould take upon him the Duties of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government, when his Infirmities had render'd him unable to di&s;charge them.</P>
<P>If this Affair did any ways di&s;plea&s;e the Hierar|chy, there was another Occurrence fell out about this Time, in which <HI>Ralegh,</HI> by &s;hewing a gene|rous and charitable In&s;tance of his Power and In|tere&s;t, might give &s;ome further Umbrage for its Di&s;plea&s;ure. It was in the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>John Udall,</HI> Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, a good Scholar, and a Man of good Parts; but very zealous for the Reforma|tion, even under the epi&s;copal Government; for which he was reckoned among the Nonconformi&s;ts, or rather Puritans of tho&s;e Times.

<P>The Jury did as they were taught, being told it &s;hould be no further Danger to the Author, but tend to his good; of which Verdict they afterwards repented.

<P>The latter end of this Year, and Beginning of next, we meet with Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> in the Par|liament-Hou&s;e, whether return'd for a County or a Borough, and for which, does not at pre&s;ent par|ticularly occur. A late Author of his Life ob|&s;erves, <HI>that his Speeches were full of Rea&s;on and Eloquence, no Man in his Days being more a Ma&s;ter of Language than him&s;elf;</HI> and Matter too, he might have added; none more &s;atisfactorily con|firming his Arguments with Facts and Experience than he did, even in his unpremeditated Speeches, no le&s;s than in the more deliberate Compo&s;itions of his Pen; &s;o full of Ob&s;ervation he was upon all Times and Countries, and &s;o readily he could ap|ply it upon all Occa&s;ions; which now won him great Regard, as a Speaker in the Hou&s;e, and af|terwards as an Author, to the whole World. Soon after the opening of the Se&s;&s;ion, we find him upon the Committee for the Liberties and Privileges of the Members, to examine and make Report of all Ca&s;es touching the Elections and Returns during the &s;aid Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament: Al&s;o in another again&s;t Popi&s;h Recu&s;ants. And when <HI>the Bill for certain Sub&s;idies</HI> to be granted her Maje&s;ty was in Debate, and &s;ome Members were for having it ex|pre&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;h'd in the Bill, that the &s;aid Sub&s;i|dies &s;hould be for maintaining a War impul&s;ive and defen&s;ive again&s;t the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that the Conque&s;ts we made over them might be legal and waarranta|ble; Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> &s;econded tho&s;e Speeches, and &s;aid, <HI>He knew many, who held it not lawful in Con&s;cience, as the Time was, to take Prizes from the</HI> Spaniard; <HI>and he knew, that if it might be lawful and open War, there would be more voluntary Hands</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="137">
<HI>to fight again&s;t the</HI> Spaniard <HI>than the Queen &s;hould &s;tand in need of to &s;end to Sea.</HI> Accordingly he was appointed of the Committee for drawing the Arti|cles and Preamble of the &s;aid Bill. Further, when the Nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;aid Sub&s;idy came to be en|forc'd, <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;pake for it, <HI>not only</HI> (as he pro|te&s;ted) <HI>to plea&s;e the Queen, to whom he was infinitely bound above his De&s;erts; but for the Neee&s;&s;ity be both &s;aw and knew.</HI> He very well di&s;cover'd the great Strength of the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> and, to &s;hew his Mightine&s;s, he told how he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd all the World; as al&s;o that his Malice and ill Purpo&s;e was evident to this Realm, he &s;hewed how on every Side he had beleaguer'd us. <HI>That in</HI> Denmark, <HI>the King being young, had corrupted the Council and Nobility; &s;o as it was very likely he would &s;peed him&s;elf of Shipping from thence. In the marine Towns of the</HI> Low-Countries, <HI>and in</HI> Norway, <HI>he laid in great Store of Shipping. In</HI> France, <HI>he had the Parlia|ment Towns at his Command; in</HI> Britany, <HI>he had all the be&s;t Havens; and in</HI> Scotland, <HI>had &s;o corrupted the Nobility, that he had promis'd them Forces to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Papi&s;ts; that they were ready to join with any foreign Forces that would make them &s;trong, to be by them&s;elves and re&s;i&s;t others; for, as he thought, there were not &s;ix Gentlemen of that Country of one Reli|gion. In his own Counry, there is all po&s;&s;ible pre|paring; and he is coming with &s;ixty Gallies, be&s;ides other Shipping, with Purpo&s;e to annoy us. We mu&s;t then have no Ships, if he invade us riding at Anchor; all will be little enough to with&s;tand him. At his coming, he fully re&s;olveth to get</HI> Plymouth, <HI>or at lea&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome of the Havens this Summer within our Land; and</HI> Plymouth <HI>is a Place of mo&s;t Danger, for no Ordnance can be carried thither to remove him, the Pa&s;&s;ages will not give leave. Now the Way to defeat him, is to &s;end a Royal Army to &s;upplant him</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="138">
<HI>in</HI> Britany, <HI>and to po&s;&s;e&s;s our&s;elves there; and to &s;end a &s;trong Navy to Sea, and to lie upon the</HI> Cape, <HI>and at</HI> Lambuck; <HI>to which Places come all his Ships with Riches from all Parts, and then they may &s;et upon all that come. This we are able to do, and undoubtedly with fortunate Succe&s;s, if we undertake it.</HI> But &s;ome Divi&s;ion ari&s;ing upon the Que&s;tion how they &s;hould make the Motion for this Supply to the Lords, <HI>Ralegh</HI> made &s;o judicious a Di&s;tinction of the Cau&s;e thereof, and &s;o clearly demon&s;trated the erroneous Manner in which it had been pro|pounded, that it appears plainly, the &s;ucce&s;sful Turn which follow'd thereupon was owing to him alone. After this Conference, &s;everal Forms of Provi&s;ion were propos'd by way of treble Sub&s;idies, and like proportionable Fifteenths and Tenths, with other Kinds of Benevolence: Sir <HI>Thomas Cecil</HI> was for three Sub&s;idies to be paid in four Years, and to be charged upon Men of ten Pounds and upwards, to &s;pare tho&s;e who were under. Sir <HI>Henry Knivet</HI> alledged the Poverty of our Country again&s;t the Rea&s;ons u&s;ed, and imputed that Poverty to the bringing in more foreign Wares, than we vented Commodities, whereby our Money was carried out of our Country, which was thus become like a Pond that was fed with a Spring, but having a Breach, through which more pa&s;&s;ed away than came in: Thereupon moved for a Survey to be taken of all Men's Lands and Goods in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o much to be yearly levied as might maintain the Queens Wars, the Proportion being &s;et 100,000 Pounds yearly; or, if that was mi&s;liked, every Man on his Word &s;hould deliver in, to his Power, the Profits of his Lands and Goods; &s;o a Propor|tion to be ce&s;s'd accordingly. To him who argued of the Poverty of the Land, from the Multitude of Beggars, <HI>Ralegh</HI> gave the&s;e Rea&s;ons: <HI>That the bro|ken</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="139">
<HI>Companies in</HI> Normandy <HI>and the</HI> Low-Countries, <HI>who returned maimed higher, never went back again to the Towns from whence they came: For a Multi|tude of Clothiers, taking their Looms into their Hands, &s;pun their Wool them&s;elves; and except we would work for them cheaper than they can make them&s;elves, they will &s;et none to work. This engro&s;|&s;ing of &s;o many Trades into their own Hands, beggars &s;o many as u&s;ually lived by the Trade.</HI> As for the &s;urveying of &s;o many Men's E&s;tates, he thought it inconvenient. <HI>For many, being e&s;teemed richer than they are, would be found Beggars, and increa&s;e the Opinion of their Number, by lo&s;ing their Credit, which is now their Wealth. He further reported of his own Knowledge, that the</HI> We&s;t-Country, <HI>&s;ince the Parliament begun, had taken from them the Worth of</HI> 440,000 <HI>Pounds; and that tho&s;e of</HI> Newca&s;tle <HI>lay &s;till for fear, becau&s;e the</HI> Bourdeaux <HI>Fleet was taken this Year by the Enemy. For the Enemy approaching us, and being become our Neighbour, our Trades will decay every Day, and &s;o our Poverty increa&s;es. Thus it is mo&s;t certain; the longer we defer Aid, the le&s;s able we &s;hall be to yield it; yet in the End, the greater Aid will be required; &s;o &s;paring them now, we &s;hall charge them when they &s;hall be le&s;s able to bear it: For it is mo&s;t true,</HI> 100000 <HI>Pounds would have done the la&s;t Year, that which three will not now do; and three will do this Year, that which &s;ix will not do hereafter.</HI> In the Conclu&s;ion, he agreed to three Sub&s;idies; in them, the Three-pound Men to be &s;pared; the Sum which came from them, to be lev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> upon tho&s;e of ten Pound and upwards; and the Payment to be &s;peedy. Mr. <HI>Francis Bacon</HI> a&s;&s;ent|ed to three Sub&s;idies; but not to the Payments under &s;ix Years: But to his Rea&s;ons of Difficulty and Dan|ger in a &s;peedier Levy, which might hazard a double Peril, by making it four Shillings in the Pound, a

double Payment; <HI>Ralegh</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>I &s;ee no Rea&s;on that the Su&s;picion of Di&s;contentment &s;hould cro&s;s the Provi&s;ion for the pre&s;ent Danger. The Time is now more dangerous than it was in Eighty-eight; for then the</HI> Spaniard <HI>coming from</HI> Spain, <HI>was to pa&s;s dange|rous Seas, and had no Place of Retreat or Relief if he fail'd: But now he has in</HI> Britany <HI>great Store of Shipping; a Landing place in</HI> Scotland; <HI>and Men and Hor&s;es there as good as any we have. But for the Difficulty in getting this Sub&s;idy, I think it &s;eems more difficult by</HI> &s;peaking, <HI>than it would be in</HI> ga|thering. In the End, it was carried agreeable to his Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Soon after there was a <HI>Bill</HI> read in the Hou&s;e <HI>again&s;t counterfeiting the Hands of Coun&s;ellors or principal Officers;</HI> and upon the &s;econd reading, it was committed to Sir <HI>John Woolley</HI> and Sir <HI>Wal|ter Ralegh,</HI> with others. But after a Meeting in the <HI>Middle Temple</HI> Hall, Sir <HI>John</HI> made Report to the Hou&s;e, that him&s;elf, and the Re&s;idue of the Committee, upon the End of their Examination, did think it a very dangerous Bill; and not fit to pa&s;s the Hou&s;e. But the <HI>Bill again&s;t Aliens &s;elling foreign Wares among us by Retail,</HI> produced &s;everal weighty Arguments and Speeches in the Hou&s;e, which have been tran&s;mitted to us. The&s;e Foreign|ers were <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> who had ne&s;tled them&s;elves in <HI>St. Martins,</HI> antiently allow'd for a Sanctuary, and therefore &s;till had this Privilege: Here they practis'd Spinning and Weaving, to the great De|triment and Complaint of Merchants and regular Dealers in our own City; in&s;omuch that three&s;core <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Retailers had been ruin'd by them &s;ince the la&s;t Parliament, to the Diminution, be&s;ides their own private Sub&s;tance, of the Queen's Sub&s;idy and the publick Trea&s;ure; 20000<HI>l.</HI> a Year at lea&s;t hav|ing been carried out of the Realm by them. They
<PB N="140" REF="141">
<HI>had indeed &s;ome learned Council who pleaded for them at the Bar, and &s;ome of the Members &s;poke in their Behalf. Other Arguments were u&s;ed; but again&s;t the&s;e,</HI> Ralegh <HI>concur'd with tho&s;e who thought that Denization ought not to circumvent Birth right; and that to behave our&s;elves like Citi|zens to Foreigners, was but making our&s;elves Stran|gers to our Neighbours.</HI> Whereas it is pretended <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> that for Strangers, it is again&s;t Charity, again&s;t Honour, again&s;t Profit, to expel them; in my Opinion, it is no Matter of <HI>Charity</HI> to relieve them. For fir&s;t, &s;uch as fly hither have for&s;aken their own King; and Religion is no Pretext for them, for we have no <HI>Dutchmen</HI> here, but &s;uch as come from tho&s;e Princes where the Go&s;pel is preach'd; yet here they live, di&s;liking our Church. For <HI>Honour:</HI> It is Honour to u&s;e Strangers as we be u&s;ed among Stran|gers; and it is a Lightne&s;s in a Commonwealth, yea, a Ba&s;ene&s;s in a Nation, to give a Liberty to another Nation which we cannot receive again. In <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where our Intercour&s;e was mo&s;t, we were never &s;uf|fer'd to have a Taylor or a Shoe-maker to dwell. Nay, at <HI>Milan,</HI> where there are Three hundred Pound <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> they cannot &s;o much as have a Barber among them. And for <HI>Profit;</HI> they are all of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Almoigne,</HI> who pay nothing; yea, eat out our Profits, and &s;upplant our own Nation. Cu|&s;tom indeed they pay; paying Fifteen-Pence where we pay Twelve-Pence; but they are di&s;charged of Sub&s;i|dies. The Nature of the <HI>Dutchman</HI> is to fly to no Man but for his Profit; and they will obey no Man long; now under <HI>Spain;</HI> now under <HI>Mountfort;</HI> now under the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> but under no Go|vernor long. The <HI>Dutchman,</HI> by his Policy, hath gotten Trading with all the World into his Hands; yea, he is now entring into the Trade of <HI>Scarborough</HI>-Fi&s;hing, and the Fi&s;hing of the <HI>Newfoundlands,</HI>

which is the Stay of the <HI>We&s;t-Countries.</HI> They are the People that maintain the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in his Greatne&s;s; were it not for them, he were never able to make out &s;uch Armies and Navies by Sea; it co&s;t her Maje&s;ty <HI>16000</HI> l. a Year the maintaining of the&s;e Countries; and for all this, they arm her Enemies again&s;t her. Therefore, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on that &s;uch Re&s;pect &s;hould be given to them: And, to conclude; in the whole, no Matter of Honour, no Matter of Charity, no Profit in relieving them.</P>
<P>This Speech we may meet with in &s;ome modern Writings, quoted in Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s Prai&s;e, both for his Knowledge in the Intere&s;t of his Coun|try, and his unbia&s;s'd Affection in exerting it. As for the Bill, he was one to whom it was commit|ted, and who, after the Travels of the &s;aid Com|mittee upon it, offered it again to the Hou&s;e with the addition of a Provi&s;o. On the 27th of <HI>March</HI> following, that is to &s;ay, in the Year 1593, it was read the third time; and, after many long Speeches, which are not &s;pecify'd, pa&s;&s;ed upon the Que&s;tion, by the Divi&s;ion of the Hou&s;e, with the difference of four&s;core Voices; the <HI>Yeas</HI> being 162, the <HI>Noes</HI> 82. About a Week afterwards there was a Bill, for explaining a Branch in <HI>an Act to retain the Queen's Subjects in due Obedience,</HI> read; and many Speeches pa&s;s'd in the Hou&s;e before it was committed, through the many Imperfections in the Preamble and Body of the &s;aid Bill.

Now it has been a con&s;tant Tradition at <HI>Bedding|ton,</HI> that this Knight of that noble Family was Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> who was allied thereto, if not otherwi&s;e, by the la&s;t of that Sirname's adopting his near Kin&s;man, a <HI>Throgmorton,</HI> to be his Heir, on Condition that he would a&s;&s;ume the Name and Arms of <HI>Carew;</HI> and how <HI>Ralegh</HI> became related to the <HI>Throgmortons,</HI> will in a little Space appear.

In &s;hort, the Seat was now &s;o frequented, that not only <HI>Raleigh</HI> and other Courtiers, but the Queen received here many agreeable Entertainments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>Hugh Plat</HI> informs us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That delicate Knight Sir <HI>Francis Carew,</HI> once making a &s;plendid Entertainment for Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> at <HI>Beddington,</HI> led her Maje&s;ty, after Dinner, to a Cherry-Tree in his Garden, which had on it Fruit in their Prime, then above a Month after all Cherries had taken their farewell of <HI>England.</HI> This Retardation he performed by &s;train|ing a Tent or Canvas Cover over the whole Tree, and wetting it as the Weather required with a Scoop; &s;o by ob&s;tructing the Sun-Beams, they grew both great, and were very long before they gained their perfect Cherry-colour; and when he was a&s;|&s;ured of the Time her Maje&s;ty would come, he removed the Tent, and a few &s;unny Days brought them to their full Ma|turity.'</Q> See his <HI>Garden of Eden,</HI> 12 mo. 1655. pag. 165.</NOTE>; for &s;ome of which &s;he could not e&s;cape the Cen&s;ure of her je&s;uited Enemies.</P>
<P>As to the Seat at <HI>West Hor&s;eley</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> there is good Authority that it was in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Son, if not his own; and in the Hall of that Hou&s;e, there are in &s;everal Places of the Walls and Cieling the Arms of <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;till vi&s;ible.

As for the Hou&s;e, it is, and has been for many Years, an Inn; &s;o that what it was, is not clearly to be judged from its pre&s;ent outward Appearance, it be|ing much impaired, or very coar&s;ely repaired, and dimini&s;hed perhaps from what it might be when Per|&s;ons of Di&s;tinction lived in it. However, there are within fide &s;ome &s;pacious Rooms; the Parlour was painted round the uppermo&s;t Part of the Wain&s;cot in about a dozen Pannels with Scripture Hi&s;tories; but now &s;o old and decayed, as to be &s;carcely di|&s;tingui&s;hable. There is al&s;o a noble Dining-Room, the Cieling whereof is all over wrought in <HI>pla&s;tick</HI> or fret Work, with Repre&s;entations of the <HI>Five Sen&s;es;</HI> and the Chimney-piece, with the <HI>Three principal Chri&s;tian Virtues.</HI> But the Arms in the Window, as well as in that of the Hall, are by the pre&s;ent Inhabitants erroneou&s;ly called Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s; there being a Date under one of the Coats, which &s;hews it was <HI>aneal'd</HI> &s;ix Years after his Death. So that we are not &s;ure the Decorations afore&s;aid were done by his Direction, or that others more rich and elegant were not in their &s;tead be|fore them. As for his Dwellings in <HI>London,</HI> we have read before that he had Apartments in the
<PB N="154" REF="156">
Court at <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> Hou&s;e, and &s;hall read hereafter of &s;ome Acquaintance re&s;orting to him at <HI>Durham</HI> Hou&s;e in the <HI>Strand;</HI> that he had a Hou&s;e by the <HI>Thames</HI> Side, which might be the &s;ame; and an|other at St. <HI>James</HI>'s, or Apartments al&s;o in the Court there.</P>
<P>The Truth is, Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> did not live &s;o long at Court, and &s;o much about the dazzling Beauties in it, without having the Wings of his Glory, at la&s;t, &s;omewhat &s;ing'd in the Flames thereof; yet Love, which in &s;ome great Courtiers of tho&s;e Times, was the grand Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Life, &s;eemed only an Interlude in his. There was among the Queen's Maids of Honour a beautiful young Lady (as her Picture repre&s;ents her) named <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Daughter of Sir <HI>Nicholas Throgmorton,</HI> an able State&s;man and Amba&s;&s;ador, who&s;e Negociations and Characters are recorded both by the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scotch,</HI> as well as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torians of tho&s;e Times. With this Lady, <HI>Ralegh</HI> had, it &s;eems, an Amour; and, as he was a Man of nervous Addre&s;s, won her Heart even to the la&s;t Favour inclu&s;ive. This Intimacy came at la&s;t to the Queen's Knowledge; whether enviou&s;ly betrayed by any female Confident, as &s;ome might apprehend, from a Character <HI>Ralegh</HI> would be&s;tow upon the Ladies of the Privy-Cham|ber and Bed-Chamber; being wont to &s;ay, <HI>They were like Witches who could do hurt, but could do no good;</HI> or whether the Intrigue could not be long concealed for the Fruits of it, as &s;ome, who mani|fe&s;tly &s;lander <HI>Ralegh</HI> in other Particulars, have not &s;crupled to &s;ugge&s;t, the Reader has it in his Choice to believe. But in &s;uch Colours this Matter of de|virginating a Maid of Honour was heightened, that <HI>Ralegh</HI> was out of Favour again; al&s;o in Confine|ment for &s;everal Months; and when enlarged, for|bidden the Court; whence the Lady al&s;o was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
<PB N="155" REF="157">
from her Attendance. Yet, as heinous as this Mi&s;demeanour was in <HI>Ralegh,</HI> her Maje&s;ty did not puni&s;h it in <HI>Leice&s;ter, E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and other Cour|tiers, noted in their Days for &s;uch Intrigues; e&s;pe|cially the former, who turned off <HI>Douglas Sheffield,</HI> by whom he had a Son, to marry the Earl of <HI>E&s;|&s;ex</HI>'s Mother. But <HI>Ralegh</HI> very readily made the mo&s;t honourable Reparation he could, by marry|ing the Object of his Affection. It appears they lived together ever after in the mo&s;t exemplary De|gree of conjugal Harmony; and when he was in his greate&s;t Troubles, there are Te&s;timonies from one, who was otherwi&s;e none of his greate&s;t Friends, of her extraordinary Diligence and Fidelity in making Intere&s;t and Applications to a&s;&s;uage them. What his Thoughts were of a married Life, in compari&s;on with a &s;ingle one, may &s;omewhat ap|pear in that Ob&s;ervation he made upon a certain Nobleman's growing plump after Matrimony, who was meagre before; for another Per&s;on in Com|pany remarking thereupon, that it fared with him contrary to what it did with other married Men, who u&s;ually at fir&s;t became lean after it; <HI>Ralegh</HI> very plea&s;antly obviated the Rarity, by &s;aying, <HI>Why, there is no Bea&s;t, that, if you take him from the</HI> Common, <HI>and put him into the</HI> Several, <HI>but he will grow fat.</HI> Many Years afterwards, when <HI>Ra|legh</HI> wrote his <HI>In&s;tructions to his Son,</HI> he &s;ufficiently explained this Sentiment in the grave and paternal Manner he is then writing, for his Conduct in the <HI>Choice of a Wife;</HI> which Topick he concludes, with advi&s;ing him <HI>to be&s;tow his Youth &s;o, that he may have comfort to remember it when it has for|&s;aken him.</HI> And, <HI>That his Son would evermore care to be beloved</HI> by <HI>his Wife, than be be&s;otted</HI> on <HI>her.</HI> That <HI>if he cannot forbear to</HI> Love, <HI>yet forbear to</HI> Link. However, approves of a mature and &s;ettled
<PB N="156" REF="158">
Choice at la&s;t, even while he is upon the Stage of his Virility. <HI>For, believe it, the young Wife be|trayeth the old Hu&s;band; and &s;he that had thee not in thy</HI> Flower, <HI>will de&s;pi&s;e thee in thy</HI> Fall. But not to marry for Beauty only; <HI>left thou bind thy&s;elf for Life, to that which perchance will never la&s;t or plea&s;e one Year.</HI> Nor yet an uncomely Woman; <HI>as much regard being due at lea&s;t to our own I&s;&s;ue as to any other Race of Creatures; and Comeline&s;s in Children is Riches, if nothing el&s;e be left them.</HI> He remains pretty &s;afe in this Opinion from many Cen&s;ures by the hard-favoured Part of the Sex, becau&s;e he knew that few Ladies would be po&s;itive upon this Head in their Right to reprove him; nor will Widows believe he has treated them with Rigour, while they remain in that State, &s;ince he has &s;aid, <HI>Leave not thy Wife to be a Shame unto thee after thou art dead; but that &s;he may live according to thy E&s;tate; e&s;pecially if thou ha&s;t few Children, and tho&s;e provided for.</HI> Though he does al&s;o fur|ther &s;ay, <HI>Leave her no more than of Nece&s;&s;ity thou mu&s;t, but only during her Widowhood; for if &s;he Love again, let not her enjoy her &s;econd Love in the &s;ame Bed wherein &s;he loved thee; nor fly to future Plea&s;ures with tho&s;e Feathers which Death hath pul|led from thy Wings.</HI> Not that he was aver&s;e to &s;e|cond Marriages, for he advi&s;ed his own Wife to marry again, when he was in Expectation of being &s;uddenly divided from her for ever. Many other weighty Admonitions may be found relating to that Sex among his Writings, &s;ome of which we meet with, quoted by our mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Humani&s;ts and Criticks in the Manners and Pa&s;&s;ions of Life, as from an Author who had read their Hearts thro' all their Veils and Di&s;gui&s;es: But one of tho&s;e Wri|ters, tho' he allows him all the advantageous Views of Life through &s;uch a Variety of Scenes; as <HI>hav|ing</HI>

<P>While <HI>Ralegh</HI> was under the Di&s;plea&s;ure afore|&s;aid, and in Retirement, he projected a further Re|moval from the Court; the better by that Di&s;tance, and &s;ome memorable Exploit, to allay the Malice of his Enemies, and recover his Soveraign's Love. Some thought this an impolitick Cour&s;e; as if his foreign Actions could not work &s;o effectually to his Advantage, as the Applications of his Adver&s;aries to his Di&s;paragement. And hereupon Sir <HI>Robert Naunton</HI> &s;ays, <HI>That finding his Favour declining, and falling into a Rece&s;s, he undertook a new Peregrina|tion to leave that</HI> Terra infirma <HI>of the Court, for that of the Wars, and by declining him&s;elf, and by ab&s;ence to expel his and the Pa&s;&s;ion of his Enemies; which in Court (&s;ays he) was a &s;trange Device of Recovery; but that he knew there was &s;ome ill Office done him, that he dur&s;t not attempt to mind any other Ways than by going a&s;ide, thereby to teach Envy a new Way of Forgetfulne&s;s, and not &s;o much as to think of him: How&s;oever, he had it always in Mind never to forget him&s;elf; and his Device took &s;o well, that at his re|turn he came in, as Rams do by going backwards, with the greater Strength; and &s;o continued to the la&s;t great in her Grace.</HI> Thus al&s;o &s;ays another Author, <HI>His Enemies of greater Rank kept him under; &s;ome|times in, &s;ometimes out; and then he would wi&s;ely</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="160">
<HI>decline him&s;elf out of the</HI> Court-road: <HI>And then you found him not but by Fame; in Voyages to the</HI> We&s;t-Indies, Guiana, New Plantations, Virginia, <HI>or in &s;ome Expeditions again&s;t the</HI> Spaniards. And thus writes a third to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e: <HI>'Tis ob&s;ervable, that Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh <HI>was in and out at Court &s;o often, that he was commonly called the</HI> Tennis Ball of Fortune <HI>which &s;he delighted to &s;port with.

And yet none of all their own Authors have more nobly and liberally celebrated the&s;e, and other &s;uch like Adventurers of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nation, than <HI>Ra|legh</HI> him&s;elf has done.</P>
<P>For <HI>Ralegh,</HI> indu&s;trious in diving into the Cau&s;es of &s;o many Failures, having informed him&s;elf what ambient Cour&s;es the preceding Adventurers had

But when <HI>Ralegh</HI> was credi|dibly inform'd that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governor had &s;ent for a Recruit of Soldiers, and how lamentably the Natives &s;uffer'd under his Cruelties; that the very Lords of the Country were made his Slaves; that he had put one of them, named <HI>Morequito,</HI> to Death; that &s;everal others were then lying in Chains, and langui&s;hing under the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Tortures, he found &s;ufficient Occa&s;ion not only to revenge the Lo&s;s of his Countrymen, but a good Opportu|nity to gain the Hearts of the <HI>Indians,</HI> by attempt|ing

to re&s;cue them from this Yoke of Tyranny: Therefore he boldly &s;et upon the <HI>Corps du Garde</HI> in the Du&s;k of the Evening; and having put them to the Sword, advanced with a hundred Men, and by Break of Day took their new City call'd <HI>San Jo|&s;eph,</HI> which, at the Entreaty of the <HI>Indians,</HI> he &s;et on Fire.

But for the Governor, who had impri&s;on'd &s;o many of them, he was now become a Pri&s;oner him&s;elf; and <HI>Ralegh,</HI> by his courteous Treatment of him, reaped the Fruit of that Knowledge and Experience he had gather'd in the many Years he had con|&s;um'd, with great Sums of Money, upon the Di&s;|covery of <HI>Guiana.</HI> The &s;ame Day that <HI>Ralegh</HI> made this Conque&s;t, arrived Captain <HI>Gifford</HI> and Captain <HI>Keymis,</HI> and in their Ships divers Gentlemen and others, which to his little Army was a great Succour and Solace. Then proceeding upon his Di&s;covery, <HI>Ralegh</HI> fir&s;t call'd all the Chiefs of the I&s;land together, who were Enemies to the <HI>Spa|niards;</HI>

When <HI>Ralegh</HI> had further gather'd from <HI>Berreo</HI> the Proceedings of the pa&s;t Adventurers and his own, of all which he gives us a &s;uccinct and curious Hi&s;tory, he told him he was come upon the &s;ame De&s;ign, and was re&s;olved to &s;ee <HI>Guiana. Berreo</HI> u&s;ed many Arguments to di&s;|&s;uade him; as that he mu&s;t venture in very light and &s;mall Boats to pa&s;s &s;o many dangerous Shal|lows, and could not carry Victuals enough above half the Way; that none of the Country would

&s;peak with him; and, if he followed them, would burn their Towns; be&s;ides, the Way was long, the Winter at hand, and the Rivers beginning to &s;well; but above all, that the Kings and Lords, who bordered upon <HI>Guiana,</HI> had decreed, that none of them &s;hould trade with any Chri&s;tians for Gold, becau&s;e the &s;ame would be their own Over|throw. <HI>Ralegh,</HI> re&s;olving however to make Trial, directed his Vice-Admiral, Captain <HI>Gifford,</HI> and Captain <HI>Calfield,</HI> to turn Ea&s;tward again&s;t the Mouth of the River <HI>Capuri,</HI> and gave them In&s;tru|ctions to anchor at the Edge of the Shoal, and upon the be&s;t of the Flood to thru&s;t over; but they labour'd in vain: Nor did the Flood continue &s;o long, but the Water fell before they could have pa&s;&s;ed the Sands. Then <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;ent one <HI>King,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Lion's Whelp,</HI> to try another Branch, called the <HI>Amana,</HI> if either of the &s;mall Ships would enter; but when he came to the Mouth, he found it as the re&s;t.

In the mean Time <HI>Ralegh,</HI> fearing the wor&s;t, cau&s;ed his Carpenters to cut down an old Galego Boat, to fit her with Banks for Oars, and &s;o as &s;he might draw but five Foot; in this went <HI>Ralegh,</HI> with Gentlemen and Officers to the Number of three&s;core. In the <HI>Lion's Whelp</HI> Boat and Wherry they carried twenty; Captain <HI>Calfield,</HI> in his Wherry, carried ten; and a Barge of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s ten more.

At fir&s;t &s;etting out, they had twenty Miles of a high Sea to cro&s;s in the&s;e &s;canty Boats; &s;o that they were driven before the Wind into the Bottom of the Bay of <HI>Guanipa,</HI> inhabited by inhuman Can|nibals, who &s;hot poi&s;on'd Arrows: And from thence to enter one of the Rivers of which <HI>Dowgla&s;s</HI> had brought Tidings. After four Days, they were pa&s;t ebbing and flowing, and might have wan|der'd a whole Year about, and never been able to extricate them&s;elves, in &s;uch a general Conflu|ence or Rendezvous of Streams were they now be|wilder'd; and &s;o re&s;embling one another, as not to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd; but imperceptibly circulating and driving them about into the &s;ame Places where they had been before; pa&s;&s;ing between many I&s;lands and Streights, who&s;e Borders were &s;o thickly arched and over-&s;hadowed with Trees, as bounded their Sight to the Breadth of the River and Length of the Avenue, while the Gloomine&s;s of the Pro&s;pect added Horror to the Lone&s;omene&s;s of the Place.

And in|deed, but for this Accident, they had never found their Way forward to the Country they &s;ought, nor back to that where their Ships lay; the old Man him&s;elf being often in the utmo&s;t Perplexity which River to take, &s;o numerous and intricate they were. Tho&s;e People who dwell in the flooded Lands of this <HI>in&s;ular</HI> and broken World, or in all the Tracts towards <HI>Guiana,</HI> which the eight Branches of the <HI>Orenoque</HI> fa&s;hion into I&s;lands, are generally called <HI>Tivitivas,</HI> but di&s;tingui&s;hed into two Tribes, a hardy and valiant Generation; who, though they inhabited Hou&s;es on the Ground in Summer, yet in Winter were forced to re&s;ide in the Trees, where they built them&s;elves artificial Towns, and who&s;e Families were to be &s;een lodg'd in an Arm or Branch of tho&s;e aireal or vegetable Tenements; for between <HI>May</HI> and <HI>September</HI> tho&s;e I&s;lands are over|flow'd in &s;ome Places twenty Foot high by the &s;aid grand River of <HI>Orenoque.</HI></P>
<P>Departing from this Quarter of the <HI>Tivitivas,</HI> which was under the Divi&s;ion or Tribe call'd <HI>Ciawana,</HI> he kept pa&s;&s;ing up the River with the Flood, and anchoring in the Ebb; yet the third Day of his entering the River afore&s;aid his Galley run a-ground, and &s;tuck &s;o fa&s;t, they all thought their Di&s;covery was at an End, and that the great|e&s;t Number of them mu&s;t live like Rooks, and build their Ne&s;ts in the Boughs; but, after empty|ing her Balla&s;t, and much Labour, they got her a float at the End of the fourth Day, and &s;truck into another River call'd the <HI>Great Amana,</HI> &s;pacious and without winding, being one of the faire&s;t Branches of the grand <HI>Orenoque:</HI> But here the

Flood of the Sea left them, and every Man, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, was forced to tug by turns at the Oar for &s;everal Days, again&s;t a rapid Current, and in a mo&s;t &s;ultry Clime; for they were now in five Degrees of the <HI>Line.</HI> Many goodly Rivulets they pa&s;s'd on either Side, which <HI>Ralegh</HI> nam'd in his Map, and &s;hewed their Ri&s;e and De&s;cent. When three Days more were pa&s;&s;ed over, his Company began as well to de&s;pair at the Length of the Way, as to langui&s;h through exce&s;|&s;ive Heat; and well might their Courage, now their Provi&s;ion al&s;o began to fail; yet now had they mo&s;t need of Strength and Vigour, when the Cur|rent of the River grew mo&s;t boi&s;terous and violent again&s;t them. Here <HI>Ralegh</HI> had a great Ta&s;k to keep up the Spirits of his di&s;con&s;olate Companions, which could not be done without being ever foremo&s;t to endure Labour, and the la&s;t who gratify'd him|&s;elf with Refre&s;hment. He al&s;o &s;trictly commanded his Pilots to promi&s;e and End every next Day; which hone&s;t Deceit he u&s;ed &s;o often, they were forced to a&s;&s;ure it would be at every Reach.</P>
<P>Thus while he was giving them Hopes of attain|ing the Land where their Patience &s;hould be re|warded with Plenty. Providence &s;eems to have re|warded his Tru&s;t in her, by happily &s;hifting the Scene, and pre&s;enting the mo&s;t beautiful Land&s;kip they had ever beheld. For here Mountains, crowned with Garlands of fruitful Trees, invited one Sen&s;e; and verdant Plains of many Miles ex|tent, enamelled with Groups of odorous Flowers, regaled another. Birds of &s;uch Sorts and Colours as they had never &s;een, tempted them to &s;upply them&s;elves by their Fowling Pieces; and Fi&s;hes of various Kinds, by their Nets; without which, ha|ving little or no Bread, and le&s;s Drink, only the thick and troubled Water of the River, they had
<PB N="169" REF="171">
been in the greate&s;t Extremity. Now the old <HI>Ciawanian</HI> they had taken (as before-mention'd) per&s;uading them he would lead them to a Town up the Branch of a River on the right Hand, where they might be &s;upplied with all Conveniencies, and return before Night; <HI>Ralegh</HI> leaving his Galley, took eight Mu&s;ketiers in his Barge, and with <HI>Gif|ford</HI> and <HI>Calfield</HI> in their Wherries, having eight Mu&s;ketiers more, enter'd the Mouth of that River; but rowed till Sun &s;et, and &s;aw no Sign of the Town even till they were forty Miles di&s;tant from the Galley, and the Rowers were ready to give up the Gho&s;t. They had certainly hang'd this Pilot, but that their Nece&s;&s;ities were his Security; for it was quite dark, and they knew not their Way back again; but as they proceeded, the River grew &s;o narrow, and was &s;o over-&s;pread with Trees from Side to Side, that they were all forc'd with their Swords to cut a Way for their Oars. About One a-Clock after Midnight they di&s;cern'd a Light, and heard the Barking of Dogs; &s;oon after they found the Village, and there they were &s;tored with Pro|vi&s;ions, according to the Promi&s;es of the old Pilot. In the mean Time, the Company in the Galley mann'd out a Boat in Search of them; but next Day they return'd, and continu'd their Cour&s;e, after they had made this hungry and hazardous Voyage for four&s;core Miles in that River; which, be&s;ides other &s;trange Fi&s;hes of marvellous Bigne&s;s, abound|ed with tho&s;e ugly Serpents call'd <HI>Crocodiles;</HI> whence the People nam'd it the River of <HI>Lagartos. Ralegh</HI> had a young Negro attending upon him in his Galley, who, leaping out to &s;wim in the Mouth of this River, was, in the Sight of them all, in|&s;tantly devour'd by one of the&s;e amphibious Ani|mals. Not long after, being again in Want of Victuals, they took two Canoes laden with excel|lent
<PB N="170" REF="172">
Bread, being run a&s;hore by the <HI>Indians</HI> in them call'd <HI>Arwacas,</HI> who fled to hide them&s;elves in the Woods; fearing, through the Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that <HI>Ralegh</HI> and his Company were <HI>Canibals. Ralegh</HI> pur&s;uing them, in Hopes of &s;ome Intelligence, found, as he was creeping thro' the Bu&s;hes, a Refiner's Ba&s;ket, there being in it Quick&s;ilver, Saltpetre, and divers other Materials, for the Trial of Metals; and al&s;o the Du&s;t of &s;ome Ore that had been refin'd: but in two other Ca|noes which e&s;caped them, they heard of a good Quantity of Ore and Gold. <HI>Ralegh</HI> then landed more Men, and offered 500 <HI>l.</HI> to any of his Sol|diers who &s;hould take one of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom they thought to have al&s;o landed in the&s;e la&s;t Ca|noes; but they e&s;caped while he was pur&s;uing the former: However, while he was in Search of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he found the <HI>Arwacas</HI> hidden in the Woods, who had been Pilots for the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> of which <HI>Ralegh</HI> kept the chief for his Pilot, and carried him to <HI>Guiana;</HI> by whom he under&s;tood in what Parts the <HI>Spaniards</HI> labour'd for Gold, which he divulged to few of his Company, knowing both the Sea&s;on of the Year and other Conveniencies would be wanting to work any Mine him&s;elf. Therefore he ha&s;ted away from this Place, his Purpo&s;e being at that Time rather to di&s;cover what he could of the Country, and win over the People to Subjection. Be&s;ides this Re&s;traint from all Greedine&s;s after their Gold, there was another Vir|tue he no le&s;s &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd, which highly ad|vanced him in the E&s;teem of all tho&s;e <HI>Indians.</HI> For, whereas the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were wont to &s;atisfy their Lu&s;ts without Controul upon their Wives and Daughters, <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;uffer'd not a Man of his &s;o much as to touch any of their Women. <HI>I prote&s;t (&s;ays he) before the Maje&s;ty of the living God, that</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="173">
<HI>I neither knew, nor believe that any of our Company, one or other, by Violence or otherwi&s;e, ever knew any of their Women; and yet we &s;aw many Hundreds, and had many in our Power, and of tho&s;e very young and excellently favour'd, which came among us with|out Deceit, &s;tark naked.</HI> And becau&s;e he found it a very trouble&s;ome Work to keep the meaner Sort from pilfering and Spoil, when they went to any of the <HI>Indians</HI> Hou&s;es, <HI>Ralegh</HI> cau&s;ed his Interpreter at every Place, when they departed, to enquire after the Lo&s;&s;es or Wrongs that had been done; and if he found any Thing had been &s;tolen or taken by Violence, either the &s;ame was re&s;tored, and the Party puni&s;h'd in their Sight, or el&s;e it was paid for to their utmo&s;t Demand.</P>
<P>After he was recruited with Bread and other Provi&s;ions, which greatly encouraged his Men, who now cry'd out, <HI>Let us go on, we care&punc; not how far; Ralegh</HI> &s;ent back in one of the Canoes the old <HI>Ciawan,</HI> and <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> his fir&s;t Pilot; giving them &s;uch Things as they de&s;ir'd for their Voyage, and wrote a Letter to his Ships, which they de|liver'd, and then he went on under the Pilotage of one of tho&s;e <HI>Arwacas</HI> he had taken, whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had chri&s;ten'd <HI>Martin.</HI> But the next or &s;econd Day after, they run a-ground again with their Galley, and &s;he was very near being ca&s;t a|way with their new Store of Victuals; they lay on the Sand one whole Night, and were in far greater De&s;pair of di&s;engaging her than before, becau&s;e they had no Tide of Flood to help them. In the Mid&s;t of their Fears, they bethought them of fa&s;tening an Anchor upon the Land, and with main Strength drew her off. So the fifteenth Day (of their Ab&s;ence from their Ships) they di&s;cover'd at a Di&s;tance, to their great Joy, the Mountains of <HI>Guiana;</HI> and to|wards the Evening were brought by a northerly
<PB N="172" REF="174">
Gale in Sight of the great <HI>Orenoque,</HI> which they &s;oon after enter'd; a River of va&s;t Extent and Magnitude, lying mo&s;tly Ea&s;t and We&s;t even from the Sea to <HI>Quito</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> thought to be 300 Miles wide at the Mouth, 1000 Miles navigable for Ships, 2000 for le&s;&s;er Ve&s;&s;els, and di&s;charging it &s;elf by &s;ixteen Arms into the Sea, whereby many Parts of the <HI>Spani&s;h Indies</HI> might mo&s;t ea&s;ily be invaded. From other Ob&s;ervations, it appears in many Places of the Channel to be twenty Fathom deep; and in few that are &s;hoally, le&s;s than two and a half. It was called by the &s;ucceeding Voyagers to this Place, in Honour of Sir <HI>Walter,</HI> after his Name. One of them gives his Rea&s;on for it in the&s;e Words: <HI>Of the Worthine&s;s of this River becau&s;e I cannot &s;ay enough, I will &s;peak nothing; we have pre&s;umed to call it by the Name of</HI> RALEANA, <HI>becau&s;e your &s;elf was the fir&s;t of our Nation who ever enter'd the &s;ame.</HI> Now when <HI>Ralegh</HI> had procur'd one of the border|ing Princes, named <HI>Toparimaca,</HI> a &s;kilful old Pilot, who was his Brother, and who perfectly knew this River, he &s;ailed up a Branch thereof, having on the left Hand a great I&s;land which they call <HI>A&s;&s;a|pana;</HI> and thence along the Banks of &s;everal other I&s;lands, which they cho&s;e rather to anchor at than by the main Land, becau&s;e of the Tortoi&s;es Eggs found there in Abundance, to their great Relief; and for the Convenience of ca&s;ting their Nets from the Rocks, of a blue metalline Colour, which look'd like Steel-ore. So keeping always we&s;tward up the River, there open'd after a while a Land on the right Side, which appear'd a &s;pacious Champaign, and the Banks perfectly red. <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;ent Captain <HI>Giffard, Thynn, Calfield,</HI> his Cou&s;ins <HI>Greenvil</HI> and <HI>Bat&s;head Gorges;</HI> al&s;o his Nephew <HI>John Gilbert</HI> and &s;ome others, with a Guard of Soldiers, to march over the Banks, and di&s;cover what Pro&s;pect it af|forded;
<PB N="173" REF="175">
and finding it a Level of an unbounded Space, it proved, as their Pilot inform'd them, the Plains of <HI>Saima,</HI> reaching to <HI>Cumana</HI> and <HI>Caracas</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> which are a hundred and twenty Leagues to the North, and inhabited by four prin|cipal Nations, whereof one were the <HI>Aroras,</HI> as black as Negroes, but of &s;mooth Hair; a de&s;perate People, u&s;ing the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t deadly Poi&s;on of all others on their Arrows. <HI>Ralegh</HI> was mo&s;t curious to know the Compo&s;ition of this Poi&s;on, and what Remedies could be had again&s;t the dreadful Effects of it. For, be&s;ides the Mortality of the Wound, the Patient is afflicted with mo&s;t in&s;uffer|able Torment, and accompanied with &s;uch irk&s;ome Symptoms, that the Phy&s;ician cannot abide the Cure. None of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could ever extort this Secret either by Kindne&s;s or Cruelty; and in|deed but few of the <HI>Indians,</HI> be&s;ides their Prie&s;ts and Sooth&s;ayers, knew it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whether the Poi&s;on they u&s;ed in <HI>Guiana</HI> was the &s;ame with that in &s;ome other Parts of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies, Ralegh</HI> has not told us; but Sir <HI>John Hawkins</HI> informs us, that about <HI>Cumana,</HI> where they are very expert Archers, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'their Poi&s;on is of &s;uch Force, that a Man being &s;truck therewith, dies in twenty-four Hours; and, that in his Judgment, there can be no &s;tronger; u&s;ing thereunto Apples, which are fair and red of Colour; but are a &s;trong Poi&s;on (perhaps the <HI>Manchineil)</HI> of which with veno|mous Bats, Vipers, Adders, and other Serpents, they make a Medley, and anoint their Arrows.'</Q></NOTE><HI>Ralegh</HI> was therefore more beholden to the <HI>Guianians</HI> than any Body; for <HI>Antonio de Berrio</HI> told him, that he could never at|tain to the Knowledge thereof. <HI>And yet they taught me (&s;ays</HI> Ralegh) <HI>the be&s;t Way of healing this, as well as all other Poi&s;ons.</HI> Then he tells us tho&s;e Medicines which are vulgar, and &s;erve for the or|dinary Poi&s;on, are made of the Juice of a Root call'd <HI>Tupara,</HI> which al&s;o marvellou&s;ly quenches the Heat of burning Fevers, and heals inward

<P>After having pa&s;&s;ed the Mountain <HI>Aio,</HI> and a great I&s;land, which he mentions, he reached on the fifth Day of his entering the great River afore|&s;aid, as high as the Province of <HI>Aromaia,</HI> and an|choring at the Port of <HI>Morequito,</HI> which is 300 Miles within the Land, upon the &s;aid great River <HI>Orenoque,</HI> he &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to the old King of <HI>Aromaia,</HI> named <HI>Topiowary,</HI> who came the next Day before Noon on Foot from his Hou&s;e, and returned the &s;ame Evening, being 28 Miles back|wards and forwards, though him&s;elf was 110 Years of Age. He had many Attendants of both Sexes, who came al&s;o to wonder at the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and brought them great Plenty of Fle&s;h, Fowl and Fi&s;h, with divers Sorts of Fruits, and among them abundance of <HI>Pinas,</HI> the mo&s;t excellent of all Kinds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whether <HI>Ralegh,</HI> at his Return, brought of this Fruit into <HI>England,</HI> which is otherwi&s;e called the <HI>Ananas,</HI> and vulgarly the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e Apple,</HI> from &s;ome Re&s;emblance it bears in Shape to the <HI>Canes</HI> of the <HI>Pine tree;</HI> or any of that mo&s;t delicious Wine made thereof, which he there al&s;o ta&s;ted, has rather been &s;ugge&s;ted than confirmed; but afterwards, when, by a &s;peedy Voyage, &s;ome of the Fruit was brought over and pre&s;ented to King <HI>James,</HI> in greater Perfection than we can conceive from ta&s;ting what is forced out of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t Beds here, he di&s;covered one of the noble Maxims in his King craft, by declaring, <HI>It was a Fruit too deli|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">s, for a Subject to ta&s;te of.</HI></NOTE>, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Guiana;</HI> be&s;ides Bread,

This Horn is re|commended in Medicine, and the Fle&s;h for Food, &s;ince <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;oon after made a Fea&s;t of it.</P>
<P>When the old King had re&s;ted him&s;elf a while in a Tent which <HI>Ralegh</HI> had cau&s;ed to be pitched for him, they entered, by the Interpreter, into Di&s;cour&s;e about the Murder of <HI>Morequito,</HI> his Pre|dece&s;&s;or, and the other Violations of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Then <HI>Ralegh</HI> acquainted him with the Cau&s;e of his coming thither, who&s;e Servant he was, and that it was his Queen's Plea&s;ure he &s;hould undertake this Voyage to deliver them from the Tyranny of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> dilating at large on her Maje&s;ty's Power, Ju&s;tice, and Clemency towards all oppre&s;|&s;ed Nations: all which, being with great Reverence and Attention received, he began to &s;ound the old Man touching <HI>Guiana;</HI> as what Sort of Common|wealth it was, how governed, of what Strength and Policy, of what Extent; with whom in Alli|ance or Enmity; la&s;tly, the Di&s;tance and Way to enter the Heart of the Country? The King gave &s;uch ample and perfect Account of the&s;e Particulars, that <HI>Ralegh</HI> wondered to find a Man of &s;uch Gra|vity, Judgment, and good Di&s;cour&s;e, without the Help of Learning or Breeding. After his Depar|ture, <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;ailed we&s;tward to view the famous River <HI>Caroli,</HI> both becau&s;e it was &s;o wonderful in it&s;elf, and led to the &s;tronge&s;t Nations of all the Frontiers, who were Enemies to the <HI>Epuremei,</HI> &s;ubjects to the <HI>Inga,</HI> or Emperor of <HI>Guiana</HI> and <HI>Manoa.</HI> Even when he was &s;hort of it, or lower down than the Port of <HI>Morequito,</HI> he heard the
<PB N="176" REF="178">
roaring Falls of this River; but when he entered it with his Barge and Wherries, thinking to have gone up &s;ome 40 Miles to the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ipagotos,</HI> he was not able with a Barge of eight Oars to row one Stone's Throw in an Hour; and yet the River is as broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Woolwich.</HI> Therefore en|camping on the Banks, he &s;ent off an <HI>Indian</HI> to ac|quaint the Nations upon the River of his Arrival, and his Purpo&s;e; and that he de&s;ired to &s;ee the Lords of <HI>Canuria,</HI> who dwelt in that Province. Then one of the Princes came down, named <HI>Wanu|retona,</HI> with many of his People, and brought great Store of Provi&s;ions, as the re&s;t had done. By him <HI>Ralegh</HI> found, the <HI>Carolians</HI> were not only Enemies to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but mo&s;t of all to the <HI>Epuremei,</HI> who abounded in Gold; and that there were three mighty Nations at the Head of that Ri|ver, which would join him again&s;t them. He was further informed by one Capt. <HI>George,</HI> whom he had taken with <HI>Berreo,</HI> that near the Banks of this River there was a great Silver Mine; but the Rivers were all now &s;o ri&s;en, that it was not po&s;&s;i|ble for the Strength of Man with any Boat to row again&s;t the Stream. Therefore he di&s;patched a Party between 30 and 40 to coa&s;t the River by Land, while him&s;elf, with two or three Officers and half a dozen Shot, marched over-land to view the &s;trange and wonderful Overfalls of the &s;aid Ri|ver <HI>Caroli,</HI> which roared at &s;uch a Di&s;tance, and the Plains adjoining, with the Re&s;t of the Province of <HI>Canuri.</HI> When they had got to the Top of the fir&s;t Hills over-looking the River, they beheld that prodigious Breach of Waters which poured down <HI>Caroli,</HI> and how it ran in three Streams for 20 Miles together. No le&s;s than 10 or 12 of the&s;e &s;teep Cataracts appeared in Sight, each as high above the other as a Church-tower; which ru&s;hed
<PB N="177" REF="179">
down with &s;uch Violence, that the very Rebound of the Waters made the Place &s;eem as if it had been all over covered with a great Shower of Rain. And here <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;ays, he never &s;aw a more beautiful Country, nor more lively Pro&s;pects; the Hills &s;o rai&s;ed up and down about the Valleys; the Waters winding into &s;uch various Branches; the Plains &s;o clear of Bu&s;h and Stubble, and covered all with fair green Gra&s;s; the Ground of hard Sand, and ea&s;y for the March either of Hor&s;e or Foot; the Deer cro&s;&s;ing in every Path; the Birds, towards the Evening, &s;inging on every Tree a thou&s;and &s;e|veral Tunes, with Cranes and Herons of white, crim&s;on and Carnation, pearched along the River Banks; the Air refre&s;hed with gentle ea&s;terly Breezes; and every Stone they &s;tooped to take up, promi&s;ing either Gold or Silver by its Complexion. His Company, at their return, brought &s;everal of the&s;e Stones home; which they rather found co|loured outwardly like Gold, than any of that Me|tal fixed in them; for tho&s;e who had lea&s;t Judg|ment or Experience, kept only &s;uch as glittered, and would not be per&s;uaded but they were rich, becau&s;e they &s;hone, thereby bred an Opinion, that all the Re&s;t were no better. Yet &s;ome of the&s;e Stones <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;hewed afterwards to a <HI>Spaniard</HI> of the <HI>Caraccas,</HI> who told him it was <HI>El madre del oro,</HI> that is, <HI>the Mother of Gold;</HI> and that the Mine was further in the Ground.</P>
<P>Among the goodly Rivers beyond the <HI>Caroli,</HI> there is one name <HI>Caora.</HI> Upon this Branch, it was atte&s;ted to <HI>Ralegh</HI> by the mo&s;t intelligent and credible Chiefs of the adjacent Parts, there dwelt a Nation of People who&s;e Heads appear not above their Shoulders; which, becau&s;e every Body in the Provinces of <HI>Aromaia</HI> and <HI>Canuri</HI> al&s;o affirmed, he was inclined to believe. They are called <HI>Ewaipa|noma,</HI>

and reported to have their Eyes in their Shoulders, and Mouths in their Brea&s;ts (or in a level with them). It was further avouched to him, they u&s;ed Bows, Arrows, and Clubs thrice as big as any of the <HI>Guianians;</HI> and that one being taken Pri&s;oner the Year before was brought into <HI>Aromata.</HI> When <HI>Ralegh</HI> doubted of &s;uch a Race to the Prince, hereafter-mentioned, who came with him into <HI>England,</HI> he an&s;wered, it was no wonder among them; for they had lately &s;lain many Hundreds of his Father's People. <HI>Ralegh</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>That</HI> Man|devill <HI>had before written of &s;uch a Nation; and that, &s;ince the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indian <HI>Di&s;coveries, we find his Re|lations true, which were before held incredible.</HI> Fur|ther, that when he afterwards arrived at <HI>Cumana,</HI> he &s;poke with a <HI>Spaniard</HI> eminent for his Travels, and withal for his Credit and Veracity; who, hear|ing that <HI>Ralegh</HI> had been as far in <HI>Guiana</HI> as <HI>Caroli,</HI> immediately a&s;ked him if he had &s;een tho&s;e People, and declared he had &s;een many of them. Then <HI>Ralegh</HI> names &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Merchants of <HI>London,</HI> who were there pre&s;ent, and heard what this <HI>Spa|niard</HI> had thus a&s;&s;erted. <HI>Whether it is true or no (&s;ays he) the Matter is not great, neither can there be any Profit in the Imagination; for my own Part, I &s;aw them not; but an re&s;olved, that &s;o many Peo|ple did not all combine or fore think to make the Re|port.</HI> After all, whether the Ob&s;ervation of any Garment loo&s;ely ri&s;ing above the Shoulders of the&s;e People, or the crouching Po&s;ture in which they were &s;o much &s;een, by their con&s;tant Exerci&s;e of Archery, might not fir&s;t give &s;ome Ri&s;e to this Report, I leave for others more largely to explain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Theobald</HI> thinks, we may be able to account, in a few Lines, for the My&s;tery of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed headle&s;s People: For <HI>Olearius</HI> &s;peaking (&s;ays he) of the Manner of Cloathing of the <HI>Sa|mojeds.</HI> a People of North <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Their Garments are made like tho&s;e called <HI>Co&s;aques,</HI> open only at the Necks, When the Cold is extraordinary, they put their <HI>Co&s;aques</HI> over their Heads, and let the Sleeves hang down, their Faces be|ing not to be &s;een, but at the Cleft, which is at the Neck; whence &s;ome have taken occa&s;ion to write, that in the&s;e <HI>nor|thern</HI> Countries, there are People without Heads, having their Faces in their Brea&s;ts.'</Q> <BIBL><HI>Theobald</HI>"s <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> 8vo. 1733. vol.</BIBL></NOTE>;

he could not perceive <HI>Ralegh</HI> meant to proceed to the great City of <HI>Manoa,</HI> becau&s;e neither the Sea|&s;on of the Year nor the Strength of his Company would enable him; for he remember'd that in the Plains of <HI>Maqureguarai,</HI> the fir&s;t civil Town of <HI>Guiana,</HI> where all the Gold Plates were made which were &s;catter'd over the neighbouring Nations, and about four Days Journey from his own, 300 <HI>Spaniards</HI> were de&s;troy'd, who had no Friends among the Borderers; therefore advi&s;ed <HI>Ralegh</HI> never to invade the &s;trong Parts of <HI>Guiana,</HI> with|out the Help of all tho&s;e Nations which were their Enemies. <HI>Ralegh</HI> a&s;k'd, if he thought the Com|pany he had with him were &s;ufficient to take that Town: The King thought they were, and prof|fer'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with all his Borderers, if he would leave him a Guard of fifty Men upon his Departure; but <HI>Ralegh</HI> knowing if they &s;hould e&s;cape the <HI>Guanians,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> expecting Sup|plies, would repay upon them this Treatment at <HI>Trinidad,</HI> very plau&s;ibly excus'd him&s;elf.

He al&s;o brought over &s;ome Gold Ore of their Mines, <HI>whereof I know &s;ome is as rich</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>as any the Earth yields, and of which I know there is &s;ufficient, if nothing el&s;e were to be hop'd for;</HI> but they wanted Time, Hands and In&s;truments to break the Ground, without which there could be

no working of Mines. <HI>We &s;aw</HI> (adds he) <HI>all the Hills with Stones of the Colour of Gold and Silver, and we try'd them to be no</HI> Marque&s;ite; <HI>and there|fore &s;uch as the</HI> Spaniards <HI>call</HI> El madre del oro, <HI>or, the Mother of Gold, which is an undoubted A&s;|&s;urance of the general Abundance thereof; and my&s;elf &s;aw the out&s;ide of many Mines of the</HI> Sparre, <HI>which I know to be the &s;ame that all covet in this World; and of tho&s;e, more than I will &s;peak of.</HI> Now <HI>Ralegh,</HI> be&s;ides having learn'd the Riches of the Country, having al&s;o won the Affections of the People, and receiv'd a faithful Promi&s;e of the Chiefs in tho&s;e Provinces of <HI>Aromaia</HI> and <HI>Canuri</HI> to become Ser|vants to her Maje&s;ty, took his Leave of old <HI>Topi|owari,</HI> and receiv'd his Son Prince <HI>Cayworaco</HI> as a Pledge betwixt them, whom he brought into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> where he was chri&s;ten'd <HI>Gualtero</HI> with great Solemnity, leaving with the old King two of his own People in Exchange; the one named <HI>Francis Sparrow,</HI> who being a good Draught&s;man, and could de&s;cribe a Country with his Pen, de&s;ir'd to be left for that Purpo&s;e, whom <HI>Ralegh</HI> in&s;tructed to travel as far as he could to <HI>Manoa</HI> with &s;uch Merchandi&s;e as he committed to his Care; the other was a Boy, who waited upon him, named <HI>Hugh Goodwin,</HI> for whom he left Orders to be taught the Language of the Country.

<P>There was a powerful Ca&s;ique named <HI>Putijma,</HI> who accompanied <HI>Ralegh</HI> and his Men from <HI>Aro|maia,</HI> with Promi&s;es to lead them to a Mountain call'd <HI>Iconuri,</HI> which contain'd a Mine of Gold; and which (&s;ays <HI>Ralegh)</HI> he perform'd. <HI>Ralegh</HI> travell'd a great Way towards it him&s;elf along the River <HI>Mana,</HI> till, through Wearine&s;s, he was

Here, as <HI>Key|mis</HI> goes on, <HI>Gilbert</HI> my Pilot offered to bring us ei|ther to the Mine of white Stones near <HI>Winicapora,</HI> or el&s;e to a gold Mine which <HI>Putiima</HI> had &s;hewed him, being but one Day's Journey over-land from the Place where we now &s;taid at Anchor. I &s;aw far off the Mountains adjoining to this gold Mine; and, having mea&s;ured their Paths near the &s;ame Place this la&s;t Year, could not judge it to be <HI>15</HI> Miles from us. I do well remember, how coming that Way with <HI>Putiima</HI> the Year before, he pointed to this &s;ame Mountain, making Signs to have me go with him thither. I un|der&s;tood his Signs, and marked the Place, but mi&s;took his Meaning, imagining that he would have &s;hewed

<P>When <HI>Keymis</HI> return'd into <HI>England, Ralegh</HI> was gone upon that Enterprize which proved the mo&s;t renowned of any the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> undertook in tho&s;e Days again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> For the Queen having heard they had received Encouragement from <HI>Tir-Oen,</HI> the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebel, to threaten her with a new Inva&s;ion; that becau&s;e &s;he had &s;trengthened their Enemies, they would take the &s;horte&s;t Cour&s;e, and begin with <HI>England.</HI> There|fore had made great Naval Preparations, to which they might not be a little embolden'd both by the Death of her two brave old Commanders, <HI>Drake</HI> and <HI>Hawkins;</HI> and again by their late Succe&s;s, no further from her own Coa&s;ts than <HI>Calais;</HI> which taking by Storm, under Cardinal <HI>Albert,</HI> Arch-Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> and Governor of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> the Thunder of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Artillery alarmed her Maje&s;ty's Ears in her Palace at <HI>Greenwich.</HI> This Po&s;ture of Affairs made the Queen determine, to u&s;e the mo&s;t effectual Means for preventing the

Mi&s;chiefs of an A&s;&s;ault, by taking the Start of them, and &s;ending a Force &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Shipping in their own Harbours. Accord|ingly a powerful Fleet was fitted out to the Num|ber of 150 Sail, according to <HI>Camden</HI> from <HI>Stow,</HI> and <HI>Speed</HI> from both. But in the old Manu&s;cript Li&s;t of this Fleet, which <HI>Camden</HI> followed as to the Number of Men, it appears there were no more than 96 Ships of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Navy, which were afterwards join'd by 24 Sail of <HI>Hollanders,</HI> as I ga|ther out of <HI>Grotius</HI> and their other Hi&s;torians. This <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet contain'd about 14000 Men, were|of 100 were Voluntiers. Now if to this Number of Men, we add al&s;o that in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, which according to their own Computation was near 2600 Men, there might be enough to leave the whole Fleet furni&s;h'd with &s;ufficient Hands to guard and work it, and allow of 10360 Men to land upon the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Lord Admiral <HI>Howard</HI> and the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> were joined in Commi&s;&s;ion Generals of this Enterprize; but the Queen con&s;idering what there might be wanting to keep an old Head and a young one, a cool and a warm one in due Temper and Harmony, allotted them a Council of War in the&s;e Words. <HI>For the better and more orderly Execution of this your Commi&s;&s;ion, and of tho&s;e former Articles compri&s;ed in the&s;e our In&s;tructions, we do ordain, that there &s;hall be two Per&s;ons &s;erving for the Seas, and two that are appointed to &s;erve for Land Service, to be as Coun&s;ellors to you in our Name, that is, the Lord</HI> Thomas Howard, <HI>and Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh; <HI>Sir</HI> Francis Vere <HI>and Sir</HI> Coniers Clifford; <HI>and to the&s;e four, we do add Sir</HI> George Carew, <HI>Lieutenant of our Ordnance, to make the Number of five; whom al&s;o we charge by the&s;e Pre&s;ents, that they will, as they will an&s;wer before God, give their Councils to</HI>

<HI>Ralegh</HI> joined the Fleet, and the whole Army was embark'd within ten Days after the Writing of this Letter, for on the 1&s;t of <HI>June</HI> before mentioned the Fleet &s;et Sail from <HI>Plymouth.</HI> When they came to the North Cape of <HI>Spain,</HI> they called a &s;elect Council, by hanging out the Flag of Arms; and then had the Ma&s;ter and Captain of every Ship his &s;ealed In&s;tructions given him, or Letters of Ren|dezvous, which were not to be open'd till they were pa&s;t <HI>Cape St. Vincent,</HI> unle&s;s &s;eparated by bad Weather; but to be thrown overboard in Ca&s;e of Danger from the Enemy; and by which it appear'd the Voyage was determin'd for <HI>Cadiz.</HI> They had a fortunate Progre&s;s, both as to the Wind, and the taking of every Ship, which could give the Enemy Intelligence of their Approach. On the 20th of <HI>June</HI> the Fleet came to Anchor in the Bay of St. <HI>Seba&s;tians,</HI> &s;hort of <HI>Cadiz</HI> half a League.

Hence therefore we learn the Rea&s;on of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Ao&s;ence at that Re&s;olution of fir&s;t landing the Army to have been, becau&s;e he was engaged the Day before outward on the Seas in &s;topping &s;uch <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships as might pa&s;s out from

<HI>St. Lucar</HI> or <HI>Cadiz</HI> along the Coa&s;t.

The Earl excu&s;ed him&s;elf, and laid it upon the Lord-Admiral, who would not con&s;ent, he &s;aid, to enter with the Fleet till the Town was fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. All the Commanders and Gentlemen pre&s;ent be&s;ought <HI>Ralegh</HI> to di&s;&s;uade the Attempt, for they all perceived the Danger, and were convinced that the greate&s;t Part mu&s;t pe|ri&s;h ere they could &s;et Foot on Ground; and if any reached the Shore, yet would they &s;urely have their Boats ca&s;t on their Heads; and 20 Men, in &s;uch a de&s;perate De&s;cent, might defeat them all. The Earl hereupon prayed <HI>Ralegh</HI> to go and per&s;wade the Lord Admiral, who being al&s;o by him made &s;en&s;ible, that certain De&s;truction would be the Con&s;equence of pur&s;uing the former Re&s;olution, con&s;ented to enter the Port. When <HI>Ralegh</HI> brought <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> the News of this Agreement, and call'd out of his Boat <HI>Entramos, Entramos,</HI> as he return'd to|wards him, the Earl threw his Hat into the Sea for Joy, and prepared to weigh Anchor. The Day
<PB N="205" REF="207">
was now far &s;pent, and it required much Time to return the Boats of Soldiers to their own Ships. So as that Night they could not attempt the Fleet, <HI>Altho' many, &s;eeming de&s;perately valiant, thought it a Fault of mine, &s;ays</HI> Ralegh, <HI>to delay it till Morning, though we had neither agreed in what Manner to fight, nor appointed who &s;hould lead, and who &s;econd; whether by boarding or otherwi&s;e; nei|ther could our Fleet po&s;&s;ibly recover all their Men in before Sun-&s;et. But both the Generals being plea&s;ed to hear me, and many Times to be advi&s;ed by &s;o mean an Under&s;tanding, came again to Anchor, and in the very Mouth of the Harbour. So that Night, about</HI> 10 <HI>o'Clock, I wrote a Letter to the Lord Admiral, declaring therein my Opinion,</HI> how the Fight &s;hould be order'd; <HI>per&s;uading him to appoint to each of the great Galleons of</HI> Spain, <HI>two great Fly-hoats to board them, after the Queen's Ships had batter'd them; for I knew that both St.</HI> Philip <HI>and the Re&s;t would burn, and not yield; and then to lo&s;e &s;o many of the Queen's Ships for Company, I thought too dear a Purcha&s;e, and what would be termed but a</HI> lamentable Victory.</P>
<P>This Method being agreed on, and both the Generals per&s;uaded to lead the Body of the Fleet, the Charge of the Van, for putting it in Execution, was, upon <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Reque&s;t, granted and a&s;|&s;igned to him. The Ship him&s;elf was in, called the <HI>War&s;pite,</HI> was one of the Queen's, and carried about 290 Mariners.

<P>Under the Walls of <HI>Cadiz</HI> were ranged 17 Gal|leys, which lay with their Prows to flank his En|trance.

And yet that which might be thought <HI>Vere</HI>'s true Motive for returning, was ne|ver imputed to the Lord-admiral nor Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> tho', both by Speech and Writing, they argued for it as much as any; for they had engro&s;|&s;ed no Booty that might be endangered by entering upon further Engagements abroad. Yet had they other Objections to the&s;e incon&s;iderate Projects, than the Want of Victuals or Sickne&s;s of Men; for after both the&s;e Inconveniencies in <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Ship were propo&s;ed to be redre&s;s'd by <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> as <HI>Mon&s;on</HI> tells us, <HI>Ralegh</HI> was as re&s;olute again&s;t hazarding the Honour, as others the Riches that was got at <HI>Ca|diz;</HI> and in this entirely agreed with the Lord-ad|miral, who per&s;uaded them to con&s;ider how &s;ubject they might be to great Lo&s;&s;es in little Enterprizes, which would not add much to their Prai&s;e, if they &s;ucceeded; but &s;urely would to their Di&s;credit if they failed.

the wi&s;er Part, mo&s;t of the Fleet returned with the Lord-admiral to <HI>Plymouth</HI> on the 8th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> fol|lowing; and the Re&s;t, with the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> two Days after; who thence took his Journey to Court, as <HI>Ralegh</HI> probably did at the &s;ame Time. On the 13th of the &s;ame Month, we find by a Letter from the Council of State to the Lord-admiral, then ad|vanced with the Fleet to the <HI>Downs,</HI> that <HI>Ralegh</HI> as well as <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had been with them, and probably with the Queen; from whom we hear of no Ob|jections made to <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Conduct in the whole Action: Therefore probably he was among tho&s;e principal Actors therein, whom &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed with liberal Prai&s;es and Rewards. Yet that Letter does di&s;cover her Maje&s;ty's Di&s;&s;atisfaction towards the Lord-admiral, that he did not lie in wait for the Carracks, or the <HI>We&s;t-Indian</HI> Fleet, as <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had intreated him to do. And whereas Sir <HI>Francis Vere</HI> &s;ays, that when <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> landed in the We&s;t, and left Orders with him for di&s;&s;olving not only the Land-forces, but the Shipping, there aro&s;e much Strife between the &s;aid Mariners and his <HI>Low-Coun|try</HI> Troops at their Parting, the Sailors being de|termined to &s;hare in the Che&s;ts and Packs where|with the Soldiers had mo&s;t unproportionably en|riched them&s;elves in the late Spoil; at which <HI>Vere</HI> complained to the Lord-admiral for Redre&s;s, ad|ding, that <HI>&s;ome other principal Officers of the Fleet</HI> took the Sailors Part; and, as if they thought them unrea&s;onably dealt with, who had made Way by the Sea-fight, for the Soldiers to get tho&s;e Riches by Land, asked him, <HI>whether the Mariners &s;hould have nothing?</HI> To which he an&s;wered, <HI>their Hopes in the</HI> Indian <HI>Fleet were more to be de&s;ired than that Tro&s;h (as he calls it) which the Land&punc;men had got in the Town; &s;o as they had none to blame but their Of|ficers,</HI>

<P>About two Months after <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Return from the Conque&s;t of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> we find him making a new Attempt to continue the Intere&s;t and Corre&s;pondence he had &s;o hopefully begun in <HI>Guiana.</HI> To this End, he mann'd out and &s;tor'd, with all proper Conveniencies and Merchandize for Trade and Di&s;|covery in tho&s;e Parts, a hand&s;ome Pinnace which had been with him in the late Engagement, called after his own Name the <HI>Watt.</HI> therefore probably one of his own Ships.

they got out of <HI>Weymouth.</HI> In the Beginning of <HI>March</HI> they di&s;cover'd the Coa&s;t, and fell into the River <HI>Wiapouco,</HI> a River almo&s;t in four De|grees North of the Line, and about &s;ixteen Leagues in Length; but not being able to find the Head of its Falls, nor meeting with any of the Inhabi|tants to &s;upply them with Provi&s;ions, they return'd, and made towards the great Town called <HI>Aramatto,</HI> where they &s;tored them&s;elves to their De&s;ire, Af|ter this, &s;everal of tho&s;e Natives came in Canoes, and traded with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in their Ships. Then Captain <HI>Berrie</HI> hired &s;ome of them, with a Pre&s;ent of Knives, to go back unto the River <HI>Cawo,</HI> and invite the Ruler of that Place, named <HI>Ritimo,</HI> on board, who accordingly came to them in the River <HI>Chiana,</HI> where he and his Train were fea&s;ted, and traffick'd with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> much to their Satisfa|ction: And thither al&s;o flock'd, from their &s;eve|ral Towns, great Numbers of a civiliz'd Race of <HI>Carribes,</HI> who brought great Plenty of Victuals and Tobacco, which they exchanged for &s;uch Commo|dities as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were well in&s;tructed to carry thither. After they had declar'd their unanimous De&s;ire to have the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> come and rout the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> take Command of the <HI>Orenoque,</HI> and dwell in the bordering Nations, they departed; and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> made away to the <HI>Careres,</HI> or Triangular I&s;lands, and kept trading on with the People of the neighbouring Towns, who familiarly re&s;orted to them. Then they pa&s;&s;ed along through the River <HI>Marawin,</HI> to <HI>Quiparia</HI> and <HI>Macirra,</HI> for about 40 or 50 Leagues upward to the Falls of that River, and to the Sight of a rich Country above, where the People were of an extraordinary Stature, and carried Bows hafted with Gold; but were forced to return without compleating that Di&s;co|very, for Want of Provi&s;ion; though my Author,

one of the Adventurers, thought the Palmito's, and other Trees in the Woods, would have &s;up|ported them till they could have rewarded them|&s;elves with what <HI>might have done us good,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>as long as we had lived.</HI> On the 15th of <HI>April</HI> 1597, they returned from that River, and wan|dered through &s;everal others; till, about four Days after, they fell into the <HI>Coritine.</HI> In this River they met a Bark, called, the <HI>John</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> com|manded by Captain <HI>Leigh</HI> (the &s;ame, I &s;uppo&s;e, who afterwards made other Voyages to <HI>Guiana;</HI> and took further Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Country, not by Force, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Title, but Con&s;ent of the People; tho' for a Prince indeed, who de&s;erved no Right there which he had not the Spirit to main|tain.)

The Proportion of Vic|tuals was for four Months at large Allowance, and double Apparel both for the Soldiers and Mariners.

<P>About the 9th of <HI>July</HI> following, the whole Fleet &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and, for two Days, had a fair leading Wind; in which Time all the Ships received their Directions from the Council of War, with the Meeting-places from Time to Time in Ca&s;e of Separation by Tempe&s;t, Fight, Cha&s;e, or any other Accident. But being now advanced about &s;ixty Leagues, there aro&s;e &s;uch an exceeding high Storm full in their Teeth, and con|tinued for four Days together, that all the Ships were driven, with great Detriment to &s;everal, back into <HI>Plymouth;</HI> and many died of the Sickne&s;s it had brought upon them. While they lay here Wind-bound for a Month, and their Provi&s;ions much damaged and con&s;umed, <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> in company, with Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> rode po&s;t to Court. The Earl was very forward in his Propo&s;als to &s;et out again with the Fleet as &s;oon as it &s;hould be re|paired, or at lea&s;t one Half of it, being &s;ure the Enemy &s;hould have felt the Weight and Charge of the Journey. But her Maje&s;ty not accepting his Offer, it was more advi&s;edly re&s;olved, to propor|tion their Expedition to the Opportunities which remained; the Sea&s;on being &s;o far elap&s;ed, and their Provi&s;ions &s;o much exhau&s;ted: therefore <HI>E&s;|&s;ex</HI> had Orders from her Maje&s;ty to di&s;charge the Land Forces, all but the thou&s;and <HI>Low-Country</HI> Soldiers, then thought the be&s;t and mo&s;t experienc'd of this army; whereby, though they were di&s;a|bled of di&s;embarking at <HI>Ferroll,</HI> and attacking the Enemy there by Land; yet <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> offered to &s;end

<P>During this Ab&s;ence of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Ralegh</HI> at Court, which was not above &s;even Days, there fell out &s;uch exceeding tempe&s;tuous Weather as very much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the Fleet, both at <HI>Plymouth Road</HI> and <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">water,</HI> in&s;omuch that one of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s own Ships, the <HI>Roebuck</HI> of 300 Tons Burthen, ran a|ground, and bulg'd her&s;elf, &s;o became un&s;ervice|able for that Voyage; though much Pains and Care were taken by all Hands, and e&s;pecially the Lord <HI>Thomas Howard</HI> him&s;elf in Per&s;on, to have pre&s;erved her.

This gave Ri&s;e to a Mi&s;repre&s;entation by <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Adver&s;aries, that he had de&s;ignedly withdrawn him&s;elf and that Part of the Fleet; while <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> him&s;elf incurred a mo&s;t ju&s;t Cen&s;ure throughout the whole Fleet, by making the high Land of <HI>Por|tugal,</HI> and bearing in &s;o clo&s;e to the Shore, that he alarmed all the Country to make Defence again&s;t him.

<P><PB N="233" REF="235">
When <HI>Ralegh</HI> had repaired the Damages of the Storm, he here in with the Coa&s;t, making all the Enquiry he could after <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and the Fleet, but could hear no Tidings of them; he &s;ent into the I&s;les of <HI>Bayon,</HI> and towards the <HI>South Cape,</HI> well knowing the Earl could not then put into <HI>Feroll</HI> or the <HI>Groyne,</HI> as was afterwards colourably pretended he would have done had they united, the Wind be|ing flat again&s;t him; and the whole Fleet having over-&s;hot that Coa&s;t near 20 Leagues before the Main-yard of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Ship was broken; and be|&s;ides, that they could not recover it again, both tho&s;e <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prizes were wanting which only were to have been ventured in the Service.

Yet tho&s;e who could &s;u&s;pect <HI>Ralegh</HI> would prefer a Separation, dangerous and di&s;advantageous as it was now, would needs have had it thought there was much more Rea&s;on for that Su&s;picion, when there came to <HI>Ralegh</HI> at the <HI>Rock</HI> near 30 Sail more, mo&s;t of them his own Victuallers and Tran&s;ports; but the Truth is, that having lo&s;t <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> during the Storm in the Bay, and mi&s;&s;ed him al&s;o at the <HI>North-Cape,</HI> they came hither according to their In&s;tructions; where, ca&s;ually meeting with <HI>Ralegh,</HI> he held them together, and conducted them to <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> at the I&s;lands: Otherwi&s;e they had all return'd home, after they had failed at the <HI>South Cape,</HI> which was the third and la&s;t Meeting-Place, of &s;ome Admiral to command them, and of whom they would have fail'd, &s;ince none of the Fleet went &s;o far &s;outhward.</P>
<P>Soon after he had determin'd, in Search of the

This &s;eeming very probable, and no one &s;u&s;pecting that any of their Countrymen would traiterou&s;ly delude her Maje&s;ty's Fleet with any fal&s;e Informations in a Pur&s;uit of this Con&s;e|quence, <HI>Ralegh</HI> earne&s;tly be&s;ought the Captain of the &s;aid Bark to hunt after <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and appri&s;e him of this Intelligence: But he an&s;wer'd, in the hear|ing of the whole Company, that the Captain, who had taken that <HI>India man,</HI> had already &s;ent a Let|ter to <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> thereof. <HI>Ralegh,</HI> doubting it might have mi&s;carried, or that none was &s;ent, com|manded one of the &s;mall Men of War attending upon him&s;elf with all Diligence to &s;eek out the Fleet, and make Report of what they had heard. This Ship, by good Chance, met with the Fleet next Day, and deliver'd the News. Two Days af|ter, <HI>Ralegh</HI> received two Letters from <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> which &s;omewhat taxing his Ab&s;ence, and not writing, requir'd that he would pre&s;ently follow him to the I&s;lands: <HI>Whereunto (the Earl &s;aid) he was ha&s;ien|ing to find the</HI> Adelantado; <HI>not doubting but to give his Mi&s;tre&s;s a better Account of that Service, than he &s;hould yield his Ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing to the I&s;lands, <HI>Ralegh</HI> was &s;o much in Danger of lo&s;ing his Main-ma&s;t, that he was forced to &s;end the Ships in his Company before, becau&s;e he thought <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> might be in Want of them, if he &s;hould meet the Enemy; and, if they had joined the Fleet without <HI>Ralegh,</HI> who was princpially de|pended on, in Ca&s;e of any Engagement, it would have &s;trengthened the Mi&s;con&s;tructions that had been nouri&s;hed again&s;t him; but <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;o &s;peedily

<P>But <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Mariners having obtained Leave to go a&s;hore at <HI>Flores,</HI> to water and furni&s;h them&s;elves with &s;uch other Nece&s;&s;aries as they wanted; while he him&s;elf, attended by &s;everal other of the Com|manders and Gentlemen, walked a Mile or two into the I&s;land to &s;tretch their Legs and refre&s;h them|&s;elves, where they all dined in a little Village, the bare-legged Governor having cau&s;ed &s;uch Fare to be brought them as the Country afforded, which they very honourably paid for, without offering them the lea&s;t Injury; becau&s;e the Earl had before given them an Indemnity, under his own Hand, from all Manner of Violence: When <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> impatient to be in Action, all of a &s;udden, and before the Sailors could get their Ca&s;ks of fre&s;h Water aboard, &s;ent, on the 16th of <HI>September,</HI> Capt. <HI>Arthur Cham|pernon</HI> to tell them, <HI>That the General was borne up for</HI> Fayall, <HI>meaning pre&s;ently to take it in; therefore required them to follow him in&s;tantly; and though they &s;hould not overtake him, yet to find him there as &s;oon as they could, and there they might &s;upply their Wants.</HI> Hereupon they ha&s;tened away, with all the Sail they could make, after him; but no Ge|neral could they overtake. The next Morning they got Sight of <HI>Fayall,</HI> and mi&s;s'd of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> al&s;o there, to their great Di&s;&s;atisfaction, he being &s;ix Leagues
<PB N="239" REF="241">
nearer that I&s;land when he &s;ent for them, and &s;et &s;ail thither &s;ix or eight Hours before them.</P>
<P>Being entered the Road, they beheld before them a very fine Town, plea&s;antly &s;eated along the Shore; from whence the People, upon Sight of their Ships, began to pack away both Bag and Baggage: Their Friars, Nuns, other Women and Children, they al&s;o &s;ent away in Carts and Carriages: &s;o continu|ed tran&s;porting all up into the Country for two Days together. There was be&s;ides a &s;trong Fort at one End of the Town, and another on the Top of a very high Mountain near adjoining, by Nature very inacce&s;&s;ible, and artificially fenced with Flan|kers, Rampier, and a Ditch; al&s;o &s;ix Pieces of Ar|tillery, and 200 <HI>Spaniards</HI> in Garri&s;on; not reck|oning others quartered about the I&s;land. They fired upon <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Ships as he anchored in the Road, though without much Damage, and &s;et a great red Standard up in Defiance before his Eyes. They &s;ent moreover &s;ix Companies with their Colours to entrench upon the Shore, in Order to oppo&s;e his Landing. However <HI>Ralegh,</HI> in his Barge, accom|panied with Sir <HI>Arthur Gorges</HI> and Captain <HI>William Morgan,</HI> rowed clo&s;e along the Shore-&s;ide, and by the high Fort towards the Town, to acquaint him|&s;elf with the mo&s;t proper Place for making a De|&s;cent when <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;hould arrive; from whence they were &s;aluted with divers Mu&s;ket-&s;hot, which they very fortunately e&s;caped, having with them neither Targets nor Armour for their Safeguard.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Provocations, and the Want they grew in of tho&s;e Nece&s;&s;aries, wherewith they were both lately hurried from accommodating them&s;elves, and promi&s;ed they &s;hould be &s;upplied here; <HI>Ralegh</HI> called a Council of the Captains and Officers to con|&s;ult about taking of the Town, if <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> arrived not; thinking it a Shame to forbear &s;o fair a Prize, &s;o
<PB N="240" REF="242">
near at Hand, 'till they had carried all off; e&s;pe|cially &s;ince the Enemy had begun the War upon them, and &s;o proudly dared them to their own De|fence. Further, the&s;e Bravadoes, with the Hopes of Wealth in this goodly Town&punc; and the Ran&s;om of Hou&s;es and Pri&s;oners, made all the Mariners and Soldiers not only ready to mutiny that they were &s;o long re&s;trained; but reflect on their Commanders, as if this Forbearance was the Effect only of their Fear. And what made them the more eager was, that they &s;aw no Likelihood of other Benefit by this Voyage, than what was thus to be gotten a&s;hore. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Murmurs, and that they heard no News of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> in two Days, the Council was divided; and &s;ome of the Captains, who were his mo&s;t flattering and &s;ervile Dependants, as Sir <HI>Guilly Merrick,</HI> Sir <HI>Nicholas Parker,</HI> and others, were by no means for landing without his Knowledge; but <HI>Ralegh,</HI> with Sir <HI>W. Broek,</HI> Sir <HI>A. Gorges,</HI> Sir <HI>W. Harvey,</HI> and many other Commanders and Gen|tlemen of his own Squadron, were of a contrary Opinion; judging the General would repute them Idlers and Cowards to lie &s;o long before &s;o good a Town with &s;o many Ships and Men, and do no|thing, but let them convey away their Effects. This was the general Voice both of the Land and Sea-Forces; yet the violent Per&s;ua&s;ions of <HI>Merrick</HI> did &s;o prevail, that they agreed to delay the En|terprize one Day longer; when, if the Earl did not come, they all agreed to land together.</P>
<P>Now, the Wind tacking about, &s;omewhat unfit for the Road they lay in, <HI>Ralegh,</HI> and divers of his Squadron, with many other of the Ships after him, weighed, and coa&s;ted about the the Point to the North-we&s;t Side of the I&s;land, &s;ome four Miles further from the Town than they were before, and there let fall their Anchors, being a better Road
<PB N="241" REF="243">
than the fir&s;t, as the Wind &s;at. But <HI>Merrick,</HI> with &s;ome five or &s;ix Ships of his Con&s;orts, would not advance with them. They were now in the fourth Day of their Arrival before <HI>Fayall,</HI> and no General appear'd; but the Pro&s;pect of a mo&s;t in|viting Country, full of little Villages and fruitful Fields, which &s;harpen'd the general De&s;ire of land|ing, to &s;upply their Want of Victuals, and e&s;pe|cially of Water, wherewith they had not been re|cruited &s;ince their fir&s;t &s;etting out from <HI>Plymouth;</HI> therefore, by Agreement, they mann'd out a Barge, a Long-Boat and Pinnace, with 60 Mu&s;kets and 40 Pikes, rather to guard them&s;elves in water|ing, than in Expectation of any Encounter from the Town or Forts on the other Side of the I&s;land. But they were no &s;ooner ready to put off from the Ships, than they di&s;cover'd &s;ix En&s;igns of Foot, and &s;ome dozen Hor&s;e-men, marching down &s;peedily from the Town and Forts to meet them; and made &s;uch Ha&s;te, that they &s;oon po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Trenches towards the Shore where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lay, and where, with brandi&s;hing Swords; and waving Colours, they &s;tood daring them to a Rencounter. Hereupon, <HI>Ralegh</HI> found it nece&s;&s;ary to augment his Force, which <HI>Brook, Harvey,</HI> and other Sea-Officers, readily &s;upply'd, to the Number of 160 Men more. Then &s;aid <HI>Ralegh</HI> to them, <HI>Seeing the&s;e</HI> Spaniards <HI>and</HI> Portugue&s;e <HI>are &s;o gollant to &s;eek or follow, and keep us from watering, we will try our Fortunes with them, and either win our Landing, or gain a Beating.</HI> As <HI>Ralegh</HI> then rowed along by his Ships, he was greeted by <HI>Bret, Sidney, White, Berry,</HI> and other Captains of the <HI>Low-Country</HI> Soldiers, who call'd out and advis'd him, <HI>to take them and &s;ome of their Companies with him; for, if he ventured to make the Shore only with Ma|riners and his own Attendants, without their Land-Soldiers,</HI>
<PB N="242" REF="244">
<HI>he might receive a di&s;creditable Repul&s;e.</HI> But <HI>Ralegh</HI> excus'd him&s;elf, &s;aying, <HI>he did not know for what Service the Earl might de&s;ign them; and therefore was re&s;olv'd, with his own Company, to make the De&s;cent, and then &s;hould &s;end for their Recruits; by which he would undertake to lodge them that Night in the Town, and the next in the Forts: Be&s;ides, he was willing to make the Attempt with tho&s;e of his own Squadron, that neither the General nor his Train &s;hould have Cau&s;e to be a&s;ham'd of them for undertaking that in the Face of their Enemies, which they dur&s;t not of them&s;elves follow and perform.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Ralegh,</HI> having thus a Party of 260 Men, not half the Number of the Enemy, made forward; and while &s;ome Ordnance, he had judiciou&s;ly placed before him in Pinnaces, as clo&s;e along the Shore as they could lie, were beating upon their Trenches, he ru&s;hed through or under them as fa&s;t as his Oars could ply to the Landing-place; which was guarded fir&s;t with a mighty Ledge of Rocks&punc; 40 Paces long into the Sea, and afterwards trench'd and flank'd with Earth and Stone, having only a narrow Lane between two Walls for their Entrance. But now, as they approached &s;till nearer to the Shore, the Enemies Shot flew down &s;o thick upon them, that not only &s;everal of the common Men, but of tho&s;e who would before have pa&s;&s;ed for very forward and valiant Leaders, were much di&s;may'd; in&s;omuch that <HI>Ralegh,</HI> who mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly ap|prov'd him&s;elf no le&s;s their Chief in Courage, than he was in Command, did not &s;pare openly to re|buke them aloud with many reproachful Words. At la&s;t, when he &s;aw them &s;till linger, through Con&s;ternation, as much to their Danger as their Di&s;grace, he commanded, with a loud Voice, his Watermen to row his own Barge full upon the Rocks, and bade as many as were not afraid, to fol|low
<PB N="243" REF="245">
him. Hereat &s;ome Boats ran in with us (&s;ays my Author) and out of them were landed Mr. <HI>Gar|rett,</HI> then a Pen&s;ioner, afterwards Earl of <HI>Kildare,</HI> Sir <HI>W. Brook,</HI> Sir <HI>W. Harvey,</HI> Sir <HI>John Scott,</HI> Captain <HI>Henry Thynne,</HI> Captain <HI>White,</HI> Captain <HI>Arthur Radford,</HI> Captain <HI>W. Morgan,</HI> Mr. <HI>Duke Brook,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas Rudgeway,</HI> Mr. <HI>Walter Chute,</HI> Mr. <HI>Henry Allen,</HI> Mr. <HI>Charles Mackart,</HI> and divers other Gentlemen. So, clambering over the Rocks, and wading through the Water, he made his Way pell-mell, through all their Fire, with Shot, Pike and Sword, up to the narrow Entrance; where he &s;o re&s;olutely pur&s;ued his A&s;&s;ault, that the Enemy, after a &s;hort Re&s;i&s;tance, gave Ground; and, when they &s;aw his Forces pre&s;s fa&s;ter and thicker upon them, &s;uddenly retiring, they ca&s;t away their Wea|pons, and betook them&s;elves to the Hills and Woods. The like al&s;o did tho&s;e who were in|trench'd higher: And thus did he win this diffi|cult and dangerous Landing, together with the Trenches of the Enemy. A few of his Men in|deed were drowned and &s;lain, more hurt, and a couple of Long-boats &s;unk; yet was not his Lo&s;s &s;o con&s;iderable as to detract from the Ju&s;tice of tho&s;e Congratulations which were paid him by the Officers of the <HI>Low-Country</HI> Forces, when, with &s;ome of their Companies, they arrived upon the I&s;land, and found the Footing he had won &s;o &s;trongly fortified and guarded.</P>
<P><HI>Ralegh,</HI> thus recrulted, being now near 500 &s;trong, thought be&s;t to go through with the Mat|ter, and prepare the Town in Readine&s;s for <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> Therefore he appointed <HI>Bret</HI> to the Office of Ser|jeant-Major, directed the other Captains to advance their Colours, mar&s;hal the Companies, and &s;o, in order, marched to the Town, about four Miles di|&s;tant from the Landing-Place. In their Pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="244" REF="246">
divers of the Enemy, who had before braved them with the greate&s;t In&s;olence, came with white Nap|kins at the End of Staves, and voluntarily aba&s;ed them&s;elves to Offices of the greate&s;t Servility. There was indeed a Way, two Miles about, by which they might have pa&s;&s;ed to the Town, and avoided the high Fort where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> lay in Garri&s;on. But <HI>Ralegh,</HI> con&s;idering the Trouble of their March, the &s;ultry Heat of the Weather, the Hazards of Delay, and, above all, the Nece&s;|&s;ity they were under of immediate Supplies, took the &s;horte&s;t Cour&s;e; re&s;olving to bring Fort and Town all into one Days Work. Thus, at the Head of about 40 Gentlemen of the be&s;t Rank, <HI>Ralegh</HI> led on the Companies in a gentle regular Manner, full in the Face of the Fort, having only his Leading-Staff in his Hand, and no other Ar|mour on but his Collar, for which he was &s;omewhat cen&s;ur'd by his Friends; for, when they came within Reach of the Fort, they were &s;hrewdly en|counter'd with &s;everal fierce Storms of great and &s;mall Shot, which came thundering down upon them from all Parts of it, wounding &s;everal, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among the re&s;t, there was one Captain <HI>William Morgan,</HI> a brave old Soldier, in this March; who, being reproved by our Author, Sir <HI>A. Gorges,</HI> for coming to the Field only in his Doublet and Ho&s;e, without either Armour or Target, an&s;wer'd, <HI>That his Fle&s;h was of Mu&s;ket Proof.</HI> Immediately after a Mu&s;ket Ball &s;truck him point-blank upon his Belly, and, with the Force of its own Blow, fell flat at his Feet, leaving only a black Spot or Brui&s;e upon his Skin;&mdash;thanks to the Buckle that join'd his Girdle; de&s;erving to be repo&s;ited among tho&s;e Trophies in the Temple of <HI>Mars,</HI> which Witne&s;s he wants not one Brother Soldier's impenetrable Suit of Mail, nor the &s;even-fold Shield of another, who can encounter his Enemy behind the Curtains only of a Pair of Proverbs, atte&s;ting <HI>How little Armour will &s;uffice, that is well-plac'd;</HI> and, <HI>How much Fortune favour the bold.</HI></NOTE>kil|ling &s;ome, and putting mo&s;t of his Men into Di&s;|order: In&s;omuch that <HI>Ralegh</HI> him&s;elf, with his
<PB N="245" REF="247">
little Vanguard, was no &s;ooner pa&s;&s;ed, and enter'd under the Covert of their Trenches and Barricadoes at the Declivity of a little Hill, but the re&s;t, com|po&s;ing the main Body of his Forces, which, 'till now that they found them&s;elves under the Mercy of the Enemies Fire, advanced in good Order, be|gun to break their Ranks, and, from marching, fell to running on in a &s;traggling and confu&s;ed Manner 'till they were under the Walls and Trenches almo&s;t as &s;oon as their Leader, who came &s;ome twelve-&s;core Yards before them in a &s;teady and deliberate March. <HI>Ralegh</HI> was &s;omewhat moved to &s;ee this tumultuous and timorous Cour&s;e; and more, to think that the Enemy &s;aw them&s;elves were the Occa&s;ion of it; therefore he cried out to <HI>Bret, Berry,</HI> and other Captains, demanding, <HI>If the&s;e were the Men that &s;hould have done him &s;uch Service in Landing, and &s;aved him from Di&s;honour? Or this the Manner of their</HI> Low-Country <HI>Troops, to &s;hew &s;uch ba&s;e Cowardice at the fir&s;t Sight of an Enemy, and at the Mu&s;ket-&s;hot &s;o far off from a Fort?</HI> The Captains, who were them&s;elves brave enough, knowing the Truth would be the be&s;t Apology, an&s;wered, <HI>That the&s;e Companies who had behaved them&s;elves with &s;uch Irre&s;olution, were indeed Men taken out of</HI> Flu&s;hing <HI>and</HI> Brill, <HI>the cautionary Towns; &s;o were raw Soldiers, who had ever lived in a &s;afe Garri&s;on, and &s;eldom or never &s;een an Enemy, or en|countered with Shot in the Field.</HI></P>
<P>Being thus got under Covert of the Trenches and Walls which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had abandoned, and retired to their Fortifications on the Top of the Hill, <HI>Ralegh</HI> commanded Capt. <HI>Bret</HI> to appoint a Serjeant or two, with a few Shot, to go view and di&s;cover the Way to the Town, which, in many Places, lay open, as well to the high Fort here in the Way towards it, as to the other Fort at the End
<PB N="246" REF="248">
thereof: And where the Ways were fenced, they were &s;till more dangerous; it being with low-piled Walls of loo&s;e-ragged Stones, which <HI>Ralegh</HI> ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected would increa&s;e, rather than ob&s;truct the Mi&s;chiefs of their Enemies Artillery. <HI>Bret</HI> brought Word of a general Unwillingne&s;s in the Lieute|nants and Serjeants to undertake this Di&s;covery, &s;o much under the Command of the Fort and Hill; and that the Troops were rather de&s;irous of &s;lipping by, in the mo&s;t ha&s;ty, di&s;per&s;ed and unob&s;erved Manner they could; which <HI>Ralegh</HI> would by no Means &s;uffer, through Con&s;ideration of their Safety, without urging the Regard he had to their Credit in this Enterpri&s;e; for being by this Time well|informed, the I&s;land could rai&s;e 1000 armed Men, and, rea&s;onably believing they would gather their greate&s;t Strength for the Defence of their be&s;t Town, towards which he was now marching, he concluded they would have it more in their Power to defeat him, advancing in little di&s;orderly and &s;cattered Parties, than in a regular united Body. <HI>Bret</HI> did make &s;ome Offer him&s;elf to go and &s;urvey the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, if he &s;hould be expre&s;ly command|ed; but indeed it was found he could not be want|ed, or &s;pared among his own raw and unexpe|rienced Troops.</P>
<P><HI>When</HI> Ralegh, <HI>therefore, &s;aw all Men &s;o &s;cru|pulous of this Undertaking, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e Garri&s;on-Soldiers, he told them,</HI> That he would not offer that to any Man which he would him&s;elf refu&s;e: That though it were not the Duty and Office of a chief Commander to undergo &s;o ordinary a Service, but what duly appertained to the inferior Officers and Soldiers; and, notwith&s;tanding (&s;aid he) that I could therefore enforce others to do it, they &s;hall well perceive that I my&s;elf will do that which they dare not attempt; wherein I am a&s;hamed on their Behalf, that our Ge|neral
<PB N="247" REF="249">
and we are thus abu&s;ed in our Opinion of the&s;e <HI>Low-Country</HI> Soldiers. Then he called for his Cui|ra&s;s and his Ca&s;k, and &s;aid, he would both go view the Way for them, which they made &s;o nice of, as al&s;o the Pa&s;&s;ages and A&s;cents to the Hill-top; and, as well as he could, ob&s;erve the Strength and Fortifica|tions thereof, for their better Direction the next Morn|ing. Hereupon, Capt. <HI>Berry</HI> was very ready to go, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired me (&s;ays our Author) to divert our Rear-admiral from undertaking it; and I there|upon (continues he) did openly di&s;&s;uade him, who com|manded in chief, from putting his own Per&s;on to the&s;e inferior Offices of Hazard, fitter for a Lieute|nant or Serjeant, than him&s;elf, to perform; knowing that all the Direction, as well of tho&s;e Troops, as al&s;o of a whole Squadron of the Navy, did, at that Time, only re&s;t upon him, in the Ab&s;ence of the Admiral and Vice-admiral. Notwith&s;tanding he was ob&s;tinate therein; as well in &s;corn of tho&s;e who had refu&s;ed, as al&s;o indeed, out of a De&s;ire to be better informed of the Strength and Fortifications of the high Fort. When I &s;aw him re&s;olved, I told him that I would, out of the Love of a Kin&s;man in particular, and al&s;o out of an hone&s;t Regard, take &s;uch Part as he did, from whom I had received many kind Favours, and accompany him; but not out of any great De&s;ire I had to go about a Piece of Work, which con&s;i&s;ted of much Danger, and little Honour in the Performance. He thanked me for my offer, but yet wi&s;hed me not to go, if it were again&s;t my Will: Notwith&s;tanding I ac|companied him, and &s;o did &s;ome eight or ten more of our Servants and Followers. But I &s;ay truly, and &s;o afterwards it was much &s;poken of, that there was not any one more of Quality that did accompany him in that Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>In this Manner, and with this Number, did <HI>Ralegh</HI> in Per&s;on go; the only one, it &s;eems, who
<PB N="248" REF="250">
de&s;paired not of Succe&s;s, to di&s;cover the A&s;cents to the Hill; the Cannon &s;hot of the Enemy, and thereby the Stones of the battered Walls, flying on every Side thick about him all the while. He &s;till proceeded, with an undaunted Pace, to compa&s;s this Knowledge of the &s;afe&s;t Way by which he was to lead the Re&s;t, though he perceived Wounds and Death dealt on either Hand, and his own Dan|ger at every Step, more unavoidable. Some of his Company, in the March, were hurt, and two had their Heads taken from their Shoulders; Sir <HI>Ar|thur Gorges</HI> had his left Leg &s;hot through with a Mu&s;ket-ball, who, without remembering any Pain it gave him, ob&s;erves the Bullet burnt both his &s;ilk Stocking and Bu&s;kin, as if they had been &s;inged with a hot Iron. <HI>I was then hard by the Rear-ad|miral (continues he) who al&s;o was &s;hot through the Breeches and Doublet-&s;leeves in two or three Places. And &s;till they plied us &s;o fa&s;t with &s;mall Shot, that, as I well remember, he wi&s;hed me to put off a large red Scarf, which I then wore; being, as he &s;aid, a very fair Mark for them. But I, not willing to do the</HI> Spaniards <HI>&s;o much Honour at that Time, though I could have wi&s;hed it had not been on, an&s;wered the Rear-admiral again, That his</HI> white <HI>Scarf was as eminent as my</HI> red; <HI>and therefore I would now follow his Example.</HI></P>
<P>Having, by this Time, made a &s;ufficient Di&s;co|very, both of the Way for his Troops to pa&s;s, as al&s;o of the Avenues to the high Fort on the Moun|tain, which he intended to attempt, after he had &s;ecured the Town; Capt. <HI>Berry,</HI> with <HI>Allen,</HI> and &s;ome others, advanced to him. Hereupon he &s;ent &s;ome Guides to Capt. <HI>Bret,</HI> with Orders for him al&s;o to march up with the Companies, that they might unite before they came to the Town, becau&s;e he there expected an Engagement; or, at lea&s;t,
<PB N="249" REF="251">
&s;ome Salley out of the Fort at the End thereof, which they mu&s;t needs pa&s;s before they could get at the Town; and which &s;eemed to threaten Re&s;i&s;t|ance, being a very fine Fortification, all of &s;tone Work, with Curtain, Flankers, and Ditch, very artificially ca&s;t. But immediately, upon <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Approach with the Body of his Men, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> it &s;eems, abandoned it; for when he entered it, he found they were newly departed. In like man|ner, as he marched on, he found the Inhabitants had al&s;o for&s;aken the Town, and left him in Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, with &s;uch Wares and Stores as could not &s;uddenly be removed. Thus, though with much Danger indeed, and &s;ome Lo&s;s of about half a &s;core Men, with the Hurt of little above double that Number, <HI>Ralegh</HI> made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter, in ef|fect, of the whole I&s;land; which &s;upplied him, from his own Experience, with an Example to con|firm the A&s;&s;ertion, he afterwards took Occa&s;ion to maintain, and which we have, in Part, touched upon before; alledging, <HI>That a Country cannot pre|vent an Enemy's Fleet from landing its Army, with|out as good a Fleet to oppo&s;e it.</HI> And this Example, in his own &s;ummary Account, we have here &s;ub|joined, as what may give the Reader a double Sa|tisfaction, both in confirming the Veracity of that which has been here extracted thereof from Sir <HI>Ar|thur Gorges,</HI> and adding to the many other In&s;tances of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Mode&s;ty and Re&s;triction, who could, in the Recital of this Action, be &s;o much le&s;s par|ticular in the brave Steps he took to this Victory, with the Dangers and Difficulties he &s;urmounted by Sea and Land, than that honourable Hi&s;torian has been, who was a Witne&s;s of them.</P>
<P>This Town, of which <HI>Ralegh</HI> was thus po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, was called <HI>Villa Dorta,</HI> as I find in <HI>Lin&s;cthoen;</HI> who al&s;o informs us, the People were mo&s;tly of the

whom I have attended the&s;e four Days; and, finding that you came not, though your were half a Dozen Leagues before me in your Way thither, I weighed Anchor, and could not but conclude, both that you thought me &s;trong enough to take this I&s;land, and were gone your&s;elf to take in &s;ome others. Yet I re|frained &s;o long from landing, at Sir <HI>Guilly Merrick</HI>'s Entreaty, that I heard my own Company, even at my Back, murmur, and &s;ay that I dur&s;t not at|tempt it. And, to tell you the plain Truth, my In|tent, at fir&s;t, was only to water, till I &s;aw them fol|low me in that braving Manner, which, with our Reputations, we could not then &s;hun and give over, being already in our Boats for that Purpo&s;e: For, if I had intended the taking of the Town, I would ne|ver have removed &s;o far from our fir&s;t Road, which lay right before it. <HI>As for tho&s;e Officers and Gen|tlemen who had been committed,</HI> Ralegh <HI>de&s;ired</HI> "they might receive no hard Mea&s;ure in his Cau&s;e; what&s;oever his Lord&s;hip conceived to be mi&s;done, he he mu&s;t take it wholly on him&s;elf to an&s;wer, being, at that Time, Commander in chief.</P>

But the Lord <HI>Thomas,</HI> after having given his Honour with great Kindne&s;s and Re&s;olution, that he would make him&s;elf a Party if any Wrong or Violence were offered, contrary to his Lord|&s;hip's Promi&s;e, per&s;uading him to go and &s;atisfy the Earl, <HI>Ralegh</HI> took his Coun&s;el; and all Things, after a little Debate, came to a calm and quiet Con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Promoters of this Di&s;turbance, however thus di&s;appointed of their End, &s;crupled not to &s;hare in the Benefits of this reproved Victory, by lodg|ing and refre&s;hing them&s;elves not only that Night, but three or four Days after, in the goodly Town afore&s;aid; yet were they ju&s;tly puni&s;hed for their Envy and Ingratitude. For, had that Time which they &s;pent in carping and cavilling at <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Conduct, throughout this brave Action, been em|ployed, according to his Mea&s;ures, in pur&s;uing it; the Birds, which thereby they &s;uffered to fly out

of their Cage, had well rewarded their Unanimi|ty in taking them; and they would not have lo&s;t, as now they had, the Ran&s;om of &s;o many <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners out of the high Fort; nor the Spoil which they had conveyed out of the Town for Safety to that Place: So that in&s;tead of A&s;&s;i&s;tance to ad|vance the Profit of this Conque&s;t, <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Arrival brought only Means, as far as in them lay, to de&s;troy the Honour of it.</P>
<P>After the Army had plentifully regaled them|&s;elves with the be&s;t Provi&s;ions the I&s;land would af|ford, and the di&s;graced Captains were receiv'd a|gain into Favour and Command, they hoi&s;ted &s;ail; having fir&s;t, in Honour of their lo&s;t Men, made the Town it&s;elf their funeral Pile, and carried all the Artillery, and other Stores they found therein, or in their Forts, to their Ships. On the 26th of <HI>September,</HI> they ca&s;t Anchor at <HI>Gracio&s;a,</HI> where the Chiefs of the I&s;land coming on board the Ge|neral, &s;ubmitted them&s;elves with very acceptable Humiliation, and willingly brought &s;uch Provi&s;ions as were required for their Compo&s;ition. This Ho|mage of tho&s;e People bani&s;hed all Thoughts in the Earl of further repairing, in that Place, the great Charges he principally had created by this Voyage: for, he &s;eemed &s;o charmed with Submi&s;&s;ion, as to have di&s;regarded the Advantages it might have yielded; and fonder of having a Power over his Enemies, than of making any effectual U&s;e of it. When they came to <HI>St. Michael</HI>'s, they heard Ti|dings of the <HI>Indian</HI> Fleet; at which, mo&s;t joyful Acclamations rung through all their Ships: with|in few Hours after, they encounter'd and took three <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prizes, bound from the <HI>Havanna.</HI> The greate&s;t of them being about 400 Tons bur|den, was a very rich Ship, as well for the Lading,
<PB N="256" REF="258">
as the Pa&s;&s;engers in her; and this, if not the other two, was taken by <HI>Ralegh;</HI> who, being neare&s;t, gave Chace, cau&s;ed her to &s;trike and to yield. The&s;e three Ships, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, were laden with Cocheneal, and other profitable Merchandize, be|&s;ides the Silver, Gold, Pearl, Civit, Musk, Amber|grea&s;e, found among the Pa&s;&s;engers, and acknow|ledged, by the Merchants in them, to be richly worth above 400000 Ducats. When <HI>Ralegh</HI> had enquired from the Gallery of his own Ship, of tho&s;e who had computed the Value of the&s;e Commodities, and been &s;atisfy'd it would at lea&s;t amount to that Sum, he &s;aid, <HI>Although we &s;hall be little the better for the&s;e rich Prizes, yet I am heartily glad, for our General's Sake; becau&s;e they will, in great Mea|&s;ure, give Content to her Maje&s;ty; &s;o that there may be no repining again&s;t this poor Lord for the Expence of the Voyage.</HI> The&s;e Ships made a Di&s;covery of forty Sale of <HI>Spani&s;h Indiamen,</HI> whereof &s;ome were freighted with the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Trea&s;ure; and it was reported, that while three or four of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, which were fallen among them, were rifling one that foundered, the re&s;t e&s;caped, and recovered the <HI>Tercera. E&s;&s;ex</HI> upon this Mi&s;chance, called a Council of War; and &s;ome of the Colonels, with other Land Officers made liberal Profe&s;&s;ions of the daring Feats they would attempt, if Boats, Pin|naces and Men were allowed, how vain and imprac|ticable &s;oever they &s;eem'd to the Sea Commanders. For they offered, with 1500 Men, to take both that I&s;land and the Forts; but the&s;e, knowing the Difficulty of landing them, with their Artillery, on &s;o dangerous a Place in &s;o bad a Sea&s;on; be&s;ides the Strength of the Fortifications, &s;o well furni&s;h'd by this new Arrival, could not, cordially and &s;e|riou&s;ly, give their Con&s;ent, but urged many Rea|&s;ons to the contrary; yet, when the Lord <HI>Thomas</HI>
<PB N="257" REF="259">
<HI>Howard</HI> perceived this Incompliance would be u&s;ed as a Handle at home for their lo&s;ing the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet and Trea&s;ure, he told <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> that if he was &s;o forward to have it attempted, both him&s;elf and Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> were ready to venture as far as any of them; and that they would undertake to &s;pare 3000 able Men out of the Fleet for the Ser|vice: but this &s;econd Offer, thus ab&s;olutely and &s;olemnly made, though of double the Number, cool'd their Courage, upon a little Deliberation, who had made even the fir&s;t; and &s;o the Vapour was di&s;pelled.</P>
<P>Hence they returned again to <HI>St. Michael</HI>'s <HI>I&s;land,</HI> which they had left upon the Intelligence afore&s;aid; and in this Road <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> with a great Number of his Officers, coming on Board <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Ship, hung out the Flag of Council; wherein they con&s;idered about landing, and taking of the fair Town which lay &s;o temptingly before their Eyes, being unwal|led, and having but a &s;light Fort for its Defence by the Sea-&s;ide. <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was for landing all the Com|panies immediately; but <HI>Ralegh</HI> de&s;ired that him|&s;elf might fir&s;t go and &s;urvey the Place; becau&s;e the Billows were here, in &s;ome Parts, no le&s;s dan|gerous than where he had made the Experiment at <HI>Fayal:</HI> The Earl, at fir&s;t, con&s;ented; but, as <HI>Ra|legh</HI> was putting off, <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;tanding in his Gallery with Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Blount,</HI> called him back in great Ha&s;te, and &s;aid he would go him&s;elf. As he was de&s;cending into his Barge, <HI>Ralegh,</HI> &s;eeing him altogether unarmed, except with his Collar and Sword, called aloud to him, and <HI>de&s;ired him to take his Co&s;k and Target of Proof with him, if he de&s;ign|ed to approach the Shore; &s;eeing &s;o many Mu&s;kets (above</HI> 400) <HI>lying there on the Re&s;t to oppo&s;e him.</HI> But <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> an&s;wered, <HI>That he would have none, be|cau&s;e he di&s;dained to take any Advantage of the Wa|termen</HI>

<P>Neither <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> nor his Army being heard of in all this Time, <HI>Ralegh</HI> was in a Con&s;ultation about drawing up the Fleet towards him, when he per|ceived the Earl's Ship, by her Flag, turning out from the Point of <HI>Villa Franca.</HI> Then <HI>Ralegh,</HI> taking Capt. <HI>Morgan</HI> in his Barge, rowed to him, and, the &s;ame Night, &s;ent the Captain back with Directions, in the General's Name, to command all the Fleet to weigh and come to that Town. It much grieved the Mariners, to &s;ee the unprofitable Mea&s;ures which were thus taken, and that they mu&s;t relinqui&s;h the Advantages they might have made of the Town before which they lay. When the Fleet was got up to the Army at <HI>Villa Franca,</HI> a general Command was given that all the Compa|nies &s;hould repair to their re&s;pective Ships, for the Time of Year approached that the Winds and Waves began to ri&s;e too high for them to ride on tho&s;e Coa&s;ts any longer: So they left this Town al&s;o en|tire, upon what Con&s;iderations our Author knew not, but thought the Woad-mongers and Corn-Merchants might be mo&s;t likely to re&s;olve the Que&s;tion.</P>

<P>Before <HI>Ralegh</HI> could well arrive, I think, at <HI>London,</HI> to give an Account of this Expedition, the Parliament was met at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> for we read, that the Queen went thither in an open Chariot, all cover'd over-head Canopy-wi&s;e with Silver Ti&s;&s;ue, and begun the Se&s;&s;ions on the 24th of <HI>October</HI> this Year. <HI>Ralegh,</HI> making but a &s;hort Stay in Town, went to his Seat at <HI>Sherbourn;</HI> of which he mu&s;t have had but little Enjoyment for two or three Years pa&s;t.

<P>But, to return a little into the more open and publick Current of Action, we mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of <HI>France</HI> having, about the End of the la&s;t Parliament, informed the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> by an Amba&s;&s;ador, that he had held &s;ome Conferences with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters about a Peace, but would come to no Conclu&s;ion with|out her Con&s;ent, and that of the United States; her Maje&s;ty &s;ent &s;ome Commi&s;&s;ioners over: And, while they were negotiating this Bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>France,</HI> &s;he had the Argument very clo&s;ely debated in her Council at home. Here <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was one of tho&s;e, who would by no means li&s;ten to any Manner of Accommodation; and, while the Matter was upon the Carpet, was &s;o expeditious as to produce a for|mal Apology, in Writing, for his Rea&s;ons; it be|ing dated in 1598, and written before the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Death in the Beginning of <HI>September</HI> the &s;ame Year. Yet, upon this Topic, there en&s;ued a warm Di&s;pute, &s;ays <HI>Camden,</HI> between the Queen and <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> as al&s;o upon her chu&s;ing &s;ome able Mi|ni&s;ter to &s;uperintend the Affairs in <HI>Ireland.</HI> She look'd upon the Earl's Uncle, Sir <HI>William Knolles,</HI> as a proper Per&s;on for that Charge. <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> preferr'd Sir <HI>George Carew,</HI> perhaps on Purpo&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Cam|den,</HI> to get rid of him: And, when the Queen would not be per&s;waded to approve his Choice, he, quite forgetting all Duty, turn'd his Back upon her in a contemptuous Manner. The Queen, un|able to bear his In&s;olence, di&s;mi&s;s'd him her Pre|&s;ence with a Box on the Ear. The Fury this threw
<PB N="273" REF="275">
the Earl into, is better conceiv'd than expre&s;s'd; but having, with his Hand on his Sword, told the Queen, <HI>He would not have taken &s;uch a Blow from her Father,</HI> he retired from Court. The Lord-Keeper <HI>Egerton</HI> &s;ent him a prudent and pacifying Letter; in which, among other whol&s;ome Motives to Submi&s;&s;ion and Complacency, he &s;ays, <HI>In this Cour&s;e you hold, if you have any Enemies, you do that for them which they could never do for them|&s;elves; while your Friends you leave to Scorn and Contempt.</HI> The Earl return'd a long and pa&s;&s;ionate An&s;wer, as <HI>Camden</HI> calls it, in which it appears, he had al&s;o &s;uffer'd &s;ome Impri&s;onment; and wherein he makes this Reply to tho&s;e Objections. <HI>In this Cour&s;e do I any thing for my Enemies? When I was pre&s;ent, I found them ab&s;olute; and therefore I had rather they &s;hould triumph alone, than have me attendant upon their Chariots. Or do I leave my Friends? When I was a Courtier, I could &s;ell them no Fruit of my Love; and now I am a Hermit, they &s;hall bear no Envy for their Love to me.</HI> But the Lord-Keeper &s;oon brought him out of his Her|mitage; and he was, in a little Time, re-admitted into the Queen's Favour. However, his Friends, according to <HI>Camden,</HI> were apt to date his Ruin from this unlucky Circum&s;tance: And indeed, it hence appears, he had no Enemies &s;o great, or who &s;o much con&s;pired to his Fall, as his own Pa&s;&s;ions, his unrea&s;onable Expectations of an ab&s;o|lute Conformity to his own Will, and Impatience to behold any Body a&s;pire to Di&s;tinction, who did it not through his Patronage and Protection. Of this he gave a mo&s;t notorious Example about this Time; in which he made <HI>Ralegh</HI> a publick Object of his Oppo&s;ition, tho' it ended in his own Di&s;grace, and his Relap&s;e into the Queen's Di&s;plea&s;ure; which he might have prevented, had he kept his Word
<PB N="274" REF="276">
to the Lord-keeper, and &s;uffered <HI>Ralegh</HI> to have triumphed alone: for, during this Reconciliation, or la&s;t Blaze <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> made with any Credit at Court, this memorable Conte&s;t &s;eems to have been pro|moted by him, at the martial Exerci&s;es performed on the Queen's Birth-day, which was the 17th of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e martial Exerci&s;es were the Ju&s;ts or Turna|ments wherewith the mo&s;t active Nobles and Ca|valiers of tho&s;e Times celebrated the Queen's Birth|day every Year, in the <HI>Tilt yard,</HI> near her Palace at <HI>Whitehall.</HI> Here her Maje&s;ty was commonly her&s;elf a Spectator of them, with her Attendants of both Sexes; as likewi&s;e all the foreign Amba&s;&s;adors, and a numerous Concour&s;e be&s;ides both of the Court and City. Hi&s;tory has not been very particular of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Appearance at tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies; as by what Colour or Impre&s;&s;es he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, with what Succe&s;s he ran the Carreers, or what Fa|vours he bore away: But, as upon all other publick Occa&s;ions, he made a mo&s;t rich and &s;plendid Fi|gure; &s;o we find, upon the&s;e Days of Triumph, none &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him in military Bravery. I have &s;omewhere read of his curious fine Armory; and, as I remember, that Part of it is, or was pre&s;erved in the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>Lodon;</HI> but it is more apparent that, probably for &s;ome of the&s;e grand Entertainments, he either made him&s;elf, or was pre&s;ented by his royal Mi&s;tre&s;s with, a Suit of Armour all of &s;olid Silver: For there are &s;till in being, not only ancient Paintings, repre&s;enting him about this Part of her Reign in that glittering and warlike Habiliment; but mention is al&s;o made in &s;ome Writings of his being thus armed at all Points, and &s;hining in tho&s;e poli&s;hed Plates of Silver. Yet who were his Com|petitors, and what his Succe&s;s in the&s;e robu&s;t Exer|ci&s;es, there is little, I fear, remaining to &s;atisfy us,
<PB N="275" REF="277">
more than tho&s;e dark and di&s;per&s;ed Hints of that extraordinary Oppo&s;ition or Contention which <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> rai&s;ed again&s;t him about this Time, as was ob&s;erved: And this being the Original or Copy of a like Con|trivance, practi&s;ed not long before or after it in <HI>France</HI> (by Mar&s;hal <HI>Biron,</HI> as I remember to have read) may, from thence, and the corre&s;ponding Te&s;timony of an Author, who&s;e Credit and Intel|ligence are not to be doubted, be pre&s;umed to have happened in the following manner.</P>
<P>About the Time that <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> by other like In|&s;tances of his incurable Humour to monopolize the Multitude, fell into, or confirmed, the Queen's Di&s;plea&s;ure, he had by &s;ome of his Followers learnt, that Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> with a very gallant Train, gorgeou&s;ly accoutred, was to make his Appearance the next Tilting day in Orange colour Plumes. Hereupon <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> provided a much more numerous Cavalcade, and decked them out exactly in <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Colours: Then the Earl him&s;elf appearing at the Head of all, armed <HI>cap a-pee</HI> in a compleat Suit of Orange-colour, not only pa&s;&s;ed for the &s;ole Knight or Champion of that Di&s;tinction, by drowning all Di&s;tinction in Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> but thereby in|corporated him and his Train only as &s;o many more of his own E&s;quires, Pages, and other Retinue or Servants, who made up the Parade upon the&s;e Oc|&s;ions. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> certainly points at this malignant Stratagem, where, &s;peaking of tho&s;e dangerous Indi&s;cretions which were the Harbingers of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Ruin, he mentions among them <HI>His glo|rious feather-triumph; when he cau&s;ed</HI> 2000 <HI>orange-tawney Feathers, in De&s;pite of Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh, <HI>to be worne in the</HI> Tilt yard, <HI>even before her Ma|je&s;ty's own Face.</HI> But it mu&s;t have been &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee them enter the Li&s;ts, and orange-tawney running again&s;t it&s;elf. Yet the Earl's Suc|ce&s;s,
<PB N="276" REF="278">
which is al&s;o come to Light, &s;eems not to have been much regretted, being &s;o agreeable to the Merit of U&s;urpers; in&s;omuch that it proved <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Feather triumph in the Conclu&s;ion. For, though the Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> might have Rea&s;on not to mention the Earl's Name, where he tells us a Gen|tleman, who came to the Tilt all in Orange-tawney, and ran very ill, came again the next Day all in green, and ran wor&s;e; yet another Author, in&s;tead of this Gentleman, names <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> and goes on, as the Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> does, with ob&s;erving, that <HI>One of the Spectators hereupon a&s;king, Why this Tilter (who &s;eemed to be known in both Habits) changed his Co|lours;</HI> another an&s;wered, <HI>Surely becau&s;e it may be reported, that there was one in green who ran wor&s;e than he in Orange-colour.</HI></P>
<P>Such like Di&s;turbances and ill Blood as the&s;e Conte&s;ts mu&s;t have bred, might well make the Queen weary of having <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> any longer about the Court, and de&s;irous of removing him to &s;ome Em|ployment where he might more commendably ex|erci&s;e his martial Qualities. A good Occa&s;ion of|fered it&s;elf in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where <HI>Tir Oen</HI>'s Rebellion had now over&s;pread almo&s;t the whole Kingdom. A Con&s;ultation was therefore held for &s;ending over the fitte&s;t Per&s;on to &s;uppre&s;s it. The Lord <HI>Mount|joy</HI> was fir&s;t propo&s;ed: But <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> him&s;elf made Ex|ceptions again&s;t his Want of Experience and Acti|vity; alledging, <HI>Ireland</HI> required a Per&s;on of the fir&s;t Rank, who was an old General, and con&s;iderable for Honour, Intere&s;t and E&s;tate, to gain him Re&s;pect and Influence there; by which <HI>Camden</HI> thinks he would have recommended him&s;elf, and adds, that when the Queen therefore re&s;olved on <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> he &s;lightly refu&s;ed it, advi&s;ing her to &s;ome abler Per|&s;on; tho', continues that Hi&s;torian, he had an Ob|jection ready again&s;t any Per&s;on &s;he &s;hould have

About four Months after <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was thus di&s;po&s;ed of, there were great Apprehen&s;ions in <HI>England</HI> of an Inva&s;ion; but from what Quarter is not well di&s;tingui&s;hed: 6000 Soldiers were &s;uddenly rai&s;ed to guard the City and Queen's Per&s;on. Chains were drawn acro&s;s the Streets of <HI>London,</HI> Watches &s;et, and Lights hung out at every Man's Door for above a Fortnight. By Sea 16 or 18 Ships of the Royal Navy were fitted out with wonderful Speed, under the Command of the Lord <HI>Thomas Howard,</HI> as Admiral, in the <HI>Elizabeth Jonas,</HI> and Sir <HI>Wal|ter,</HI> Vice admiral, in the <HI>Ark-Royal.</HI> Whether occa&s;ioned by any Mi&s;tru&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Spa|niards</HI> had of one another, or a Policy held on both Sides to make Peace with Sword in Hand, my Author does not re&s;olve; but is &s;ure the Pre|paration on both Sides was very great, as if one expected an Inva&s;ion from the other: And yet it was generally conceived not to be intended by ei|ther, but that our Fleet had only Relation to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> then in <HI>Ireland,</HI> as if he had &s;ome de&s;perate De&s;ign to try his Friends in <HI>England,</HI> and to be revenged of tho&s;e he thought his Enemies. However it was, the Care and Co&s;t was not &s;o great as nece&s;&s;ary; for it was known, that the <HI>Ade|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">antado</HI> had drawn, both his Ships and Galleys, to the <HI>Groyne;</HI> which was not u&s;ual, but upon &s;ome Action intended for <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland:</HI> And, &s;ee|ing we were not to be &s;urpri&s;ed, he diverted them afterwards to a different U&s;e. Another Benefit that aro&s;e to the Nation, by putting it into this &s;udden Po&s;ture of Defence, was the great Dexterity and Expedition wherewith it was taught to &s;pring into Arms: For the incredible Speed and Order of the Commanders, in rai&s;ing &s;uch a Land Army, and fitting out &s;uch a Royal Navy, was &s;o admired, both by <HI>Spain, France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> that all Fo|reigners
<PB N="279" REF="281">
confe&s;&s;ed, <HI>Her Maje&s;ty's Deeds in War were not heretofore more dreadful to her Enemies, than now only her Preparations for it.</HI> In&s;omuch that, it is &s;aid, an Envoy was &s;ent by the Arch|duke from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> with Overtures of Peace, tho' they did not then &s;ucceed. Whether a de&s;igned Inva&s;ion from <HI>Spain</HI> was hereby blown over, or her Maje&s;ty was better &s;atisfied about the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> we find not; but &s;he commanded her Fleet Home, after it had been about a Month at Sea.</P>
<P>Near a Month after this, <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> returned private|ly out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> with &s;ome of his choice Friends; one whereof, named Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher St. Lawrence,</HI> offered to murder the Lord <HI>Gray,</HI> whom they met upon the Road, and to di&s;patch Secretary <HI>Cecyll</HI> when they came to Court; but <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> would not encourage &s;o ba&s;e an Act. The Queen was now at <HI>Non&s;uch;</HI> hither <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> ha&s;tened to pre&s;ent him|&s;elf on his Knees before her, in her Privy-Cham|ber early in the Morning, and when her Maje&s;ty lea&s;t dreamt of him, &s;ays <HI>Camden;</HI> who adds, that &s;he entertained him with &s;ome Marks of her Grace and Favour, though not with that Freedom he u&s;ed to find. The Queen indeed ordered <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> to his Apartment, and there to continue, as <HI>Camden</HI> goes on; for the Earl had not only di&s;oblig'd her before, but now given fre&s;h Provocation by leaving <HI>Ireland</HI> without her Permi&s;&s;ion, and for &s;huffling up a Truce there, which might be broke at a Fortnight's Warning; whereas he might have made an effectual Compo&s;ition with the Rebels, and was impower'd to give them a general Act of Indemnity. The Excu&s;es he offered before the Council, were &s;o un&s;atisfactory, and his Behaviour &s;o contemptuous, that the Queen thought proper to commit him to Cu&s;tody; but appointed it to be in the Lord Keeper's Hou&s;e rather than a common
<PB N="280" REF="282">
Pri&s;on, chiefly to ob&s;truct the Infu&s;ions of his per|nicious Adherents, to whom he was &s;o infatuated, that he could not relinqui&s;h them, though one of the Objections, which would be rai&s;ed again&s;t him, was by his own Hand pre-&s;uppo&s;ed to be, the leav|ing of that Kingdom in &s;uch an un&s;ettled Po&s;ture, and returning into this, with &s;uch a Pack of Sword&s;|men at his Heels.</P>
<P>While <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was thus in Re&s;traint, Commi&s;|&s;ioners were &s;ent over to <HI>Bulloigne</HI> to negotiate the Peace with <HI>Spain.</HI> This was in <HI>May</HI> 1600. And about the &s;ame Time we find Sir <HI>Walter Ra|legh</HI> was al&s;o &s;ent, with the Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> upon an Emba&s;&s;y concerning the &s;ame, into <HI>Flanders.</HI> Their Bu&s;ine&s;s was kept very &s;ecret; yet, <HI>Albert</HI> Archduke of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and Governor of the <HI>Ne|therlands,</HI> having charged the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> it &s;eems, with relieving the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and being likely to take &s;ome Umbrage at &s;o many Per&s;ons of con&s;iderable Rank going over Volunteers to Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> as the Lord of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> Lord <HI>Rutland,</HI> and others; Secretary <HI>Cecyll</HI> wrote to the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners at <HI>Bolloigne,</HI> that if the Archduke &s;hould object in the like Manner to <HI>Cob|ham</HI> and <HI>Ralegh,</HI> they were to return An&s;wer, <HI>That the&s;e had no Charge, nor carried either Hor&s;e or Men, except &s;ome half Dozen of their own At|tendants; and finding the Queen &s;o re&s;olved to have a Peace (if good Conditions could be had) they ob|tained leave, with importunity, to &s;ee that one Action (then expected) before they might de&s;pair of &s;eeing any more of the like Kind in her Maje&s;ty's Time.</HI> Thus much of this Matter we have in a Letter of Secretary <HI>Cecyll</HI>'s to tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners. In an|other written by Sir <HI>Henry Neville,</HI> who was one of tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners, to Mr. <HI>Winwood,</HI> he men|tions it as a Report, that <HI>Cobham</HI> and <HI>Ralegh</HI> were
<PB N="281" REF="283">
gone over upon Pretext to &s;ee the Camp and Siege of Fort <HI>I&s;abella</HI> near <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> before which Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> lay; but thinks they had &s;ome other End; and that in <HI>England</HI> there was &s;ome Alarm taken at the&s;e Matters, although he was not worthy to know it. The &s;aid Sir <HI>Henry</HI> in another Letter to Mr. <HI>Winwood,</HI> &s;ays, that the Journey of <HI>Cobham</HI> and <HI>Ralegh</HI> was not upon Curio&s;ity only; but that they carried &s;ome Me&s;&s;age (to Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> it &s;eems) which did no Harm, and that he would reveal the Particulars when he was better informed of them. The&s;e three Letters were written in <HI>Ju|ly</HI> this Year, and in the fir&s;t of them we perceive <HI>Ralegh</HI> was returned into <HI>England</HI> by the fourteenth Day of the &s;aid Month.</P>
<P>When he arrived at Court, the Government of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> was, it &s;eems, vacant by the Death of Sir <HI>An|thony,</HI> Son of Sir <HI>Amias Paulet.</HI> The Queen had many Addre&s;&s;ors for this Preferment; but &s;he thought none &s;o worthy of it as Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh.</HI> About &s;ix Weeks after, that is, in the latter End of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> his Patent was pa&s;&s;ed, with Grant of the Manor or Lord&s;hip of <HI>St. Germain</HI> in the &s;aid I&s;land, and all the Lands and Tenements therein. There is a learned Inhabitant of this I&s;land, who in his curious and exact Hi&s;tory of it, giving us a Succe&s;&s;ion of the Governors, &s;ays, <HI>Sir</HI> Walter Ra|legh <HI>came in after the</HI> Paulets, <HI>the Year only before his Royal Mi&s;tre&s;s Queen</HI> Elizabeth <HI>died; and was attainted the fir&s;t Year of King</HI> James: <HI>&s;o that we were &s;oon bereaved of the Happine&s;s we promi&s;ed our|&s;elves under &s;o excellent a Per&s;on. His bare Name in the Li&s;t of our Governors does Honour to the I|&s;land.</HI> Yet, as the &s;ame Author further ob&s;erves out of the &s;aid Patent, <HI>When Sir</HI> Walter Raleigh <HI>him&s;elf had this Government given him by Queen</HI> E|lizabeth, <HI>&s;he &s;truck off</HI> 300 l. <HI>a Year from it, which</HI>
<PB N="282" REF="284">
<HI>&s;he took into her own di&s;po&s;al; and made that great Man, &s;o renowned for his eminent Services to her and to the whole Nation, be contented with the Re|mainder.</HI></P>
<P><HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had now been called before the Council at the Lord-keeper's, where, for the Matters laid to his Charge, he was &s;u&s;pended from &s;ome of his Offices. But the Cour&s;e of Penitence and Re&s;igna|tion, which he held for a while, gave great Hopes, after he had obtain'd his Liberty, that he would recover him&s;elf al&s;o at Court; till his Creatures blew him up again with their poi&s;onous Coun&s;els, and led him to expect not only a Re&s;toration to Favour, but with unrea&s;onable Intere&s;t; <HI>in&s;omuch, that he neglected the Queen's Pardon, becau&s;e it came not accompanied with a new Grant of his Lea&s;e for the farming of &s;weet Wines,</HI> as a noble Author ob|&s;erves, who adds, <HI>if ever that uncouth Speech fell from him of the Queen, which is delivered to us by one who was then much conver&s;ant in the &s;ecrets of the Court, that &s;he was as crooked in her Di&s;po&s;ition, as in her Carca&s;e; all my Wonder at his De&s;truction is taken from me.</HI> After this Speech, the Queen did as good as deny him the Wine Licen&s;es afore&s;aid, as <HI>Camden</HI> relates. Then <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> threw him&s;elf open to all ill Impre&s;&s;ions, renewing the Project he had begun in <HI>Ireland</HI> of removing by Force his Ene|mies at Court.

<P><HI>On the 9th of</HI> December <HI>the Di&s;pute was renew'd, whether the Statute of Tillage &s;hould be continu'd? This Statute was made in the Time of Dearth, and Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh <HI>agreed with tho&s;e who were for having it now repeal'd. His Rea&s;on for it was, becau&s;e</HI> many poor Men are not able to find Seed to &s;ow &s;o much Ground, as they are bound to plough, which they mu&s;t do, or incur the Penalty of the Law. Be&s;ides, all Nations abound with Corn. <HI>France</HI> of|fer'd the Queen to &s;erve <HI>Ireland</HI> with Corn for &s;ixteen Shillings a Quarter, which is but two Shillings the Bu&s;hel; if we &s;hould &s;ell it &s;o here, the Ploughman would be beggar'd. The <HI>Low-Countryman</HI> and the <HI>Hollander,</HI> who never &s;ow Corn, have, by their Indu&s;try, &s;uch Plenty, that they will &s;erve other Na|tions. The <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who often wants Corn, had we never &s;o much Plenty, would never be beholden to the <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> for it, neither to the <HI>Low-Country|man,</HI> nor to <HI>France,</HI> but will fetch it even of the very <HI>Barbarian;</HI> and that which the <HI>Barbarian</HI> has been &s;uing for the&s;e <HI>200</HI> Years (I mean for Traffick of Corn into <HI>Spain)</HI> the King, in Policy, has &s;et at Liberty of him&s;elf, becau&s;e he will not be beholden to other Nations. And therefore, I think, the be&s;t Cour&s;e is, to &s;et it at Liberty, and leave every Man free, which is the De&s;ire of a true <HI>Engli&s;hman. Af|ter other Speeches, it was put to the Que&s;tion, whether the Bill of Tillage &s;hould be committed? and it pa&s;s'd in the affirmative. But, it having pleas'd her Maje&s;ty to licen&s;e Mr.</HI> Dormer, <HI>under</HI>

<HI>her Letters patent, with a</HI> Non-ob&s;tante, <HI>this Sta|tute, to enclo&s;e 300 Acres of Ground, he prayed the Hou&s;e to admit of this Provi&s;o; therefore it was put to the Que&s;tion, and carried.

Notwith&s;tanding, I think it a Monopoly, and the Speech to be both Per&s;ua&s;ion, and to lay a great Imputation upon the Hou&s;e: And this is all I would have &s;aid before.</P>
<P>Next Day came on the Que&s;tion, whether the Tax for <HI>Dover-Haven</HI> &s;hould be continued by Force of the Statute; which was Three Pence a Ton for the Burthen of every Ship. One Member, Mr. <HI>Swale,</HI> objected, that the Charge amounted to at lea&s;t a Thou&s;and Marks a Year, yet the Haven was never the better; and that it was grown a pro|verbial Wi&s;h of any Tax, that it would not conti|nue like that of <HI>Dover-Haven.</HI> But Mr. <HI>John Boys</HI> &s;hewed the Conveniency of this Haven, and how many hundred Pounds worth of Stones were ready to repair it: Sir <HI>John Forte&s;cue</HI> al&s;o ob&s;erv'd, what large Ships of Burthen it would receive; how nece&s;&s;ary it is for the Pa&s;&s;age of all Merchants:
<PB N="305" REF="311">
As al&s;o that the Tax was &s;mall, and the Time might be when it would need a great Tax at one Time. La&s;tly, Mr. Comptroller having likewi&s;e expre&s;s'd how imprudent it was to take away this Tax, now they were debating how to defend them|&s;elves from the <HI>Dunkirkers,</HI> which would weaken the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Haven of <HI>England,</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> was more particular in the&s;e Words: <HI>There are divers Havens which have been famous, and now are grown to decay, as</HI> Tinmouth, Seaton <HI>and</HI> Win|chel&s;ey; Rye <HI>is of little Receipt;</HI> Sandwich <HI>(as a Burge&s;s of that Town, Mr.</HI> Peak, <HI>&s;aid this Parlia|ment) is even a going.

I think it therefore fit this Matter &s;hould be con&s;ider'd of, and committed:</HI> And &s;o it was.</P>
<P>The 12th of <HI>December</HI> was read, the third Time, a Bill for the more diligent Re&s;ort to Church on <HI>Sundays,</HI> which produced &s;everal Speeches in the Hou&s;e. The Recu&s;ants were very numerous at this Time, no le&s;s than 1500 in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Ben|net</HI> affirm'd, which might be one Rea&s;on for now urging this Bill; but tho&s;e, who were no ways popi&s;hly inclin'd, perceived &s;everal in&s;ufferable De|fects in it; as Mr. <HI>John Bond,</HI> who, among other Arguments, was not for expo&s;ing the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority among their Enemies, as more impotent than a Twelve-penny Fine. At la&s;t there was a Provi&s;o added to it, <HI>That if any Man came eight</HI>

<P>In the Beginning of the Year 1602, Mr. <HI>Carew</HI>'s Dedication of his <HI>Survey of Cornwall</HI> is dated, as was before intimated; wherein that Author has, with &s;uch Energy, copied forth the mo&s;t amiable Di&s;tinctions of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Mind: This agreeable Picture thereof, and the many other noble Attitudes in which we have &s;een it di&s;play'd, have made me inqui&s;itive what Portraitures remained of his Per&s;on,

It agrees very well with the Foregoing, in the Form of the Face, and Colour of the Hair and Beard; at lea&s;t as far as may be expected from the Hands of different Arti&s;ts, &s;ome Alteration perhaps by Repairs, and &s;ome Difference of Years in the Object; whereby he &s;eems, in this la&s;t, more ruddy and tann'd than the other. For, by the In&s;cription thereon, partly &s;till legible, it ap|pears,
<PB N="309" REF="315">
that this Picture was painted in this la&s;t Year of the Queen, above-mentioned; and that his Son <HI>Walter,</HI> who is likewi&s;e here drawn by him, was then eight Years of Age. Further, in this Picture the Stature of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> mea|&s;ures about &s;ix Feet, is well-&s;haped, and not too &s;lender: He is apparell'd in a white Sattin pink'd Ve&s;t, clo&s;e-&s;leev'd to the Wri&s;t; and over the Body of it a brown Doublet, finely flowered and embroidered with Pearl; his Belt of the &s;ame Co|lour and Ornament, in which hangs his Sword; and on the other Side, over the right Hip, is &s;een the Pommel of his Dagger.

<P>A Year before this, the Lady <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Picture was al&s;o painted, as appears by the Date upon it.

The&s;e are all the paintings I have &s;een of them, that I can count authentic, or mo&s;t likely to bear any true Re|&s;emblance. But have been credibly inform'd of a Picture of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> in Miniature, taken not long before his Death; and another at large, repre&s;enting him al&s;o in a white Suit, which he had, be&s;et with Jewels, to the value of three&s;core thou&s;and Pounds; and that one Diamond thereof, worth a hundred Pounds, remained in the Family till the beginning of the late Queen's Reign. In this Picture there is a Ribbon-garter, fring'd at the ends, ty'd about his left Arm. This, according to the Tradition that remains in his Family, was his Lady's (otherwi&s;e might be thought one of the Queen's Favours at the <HI>Tilt-Yard)</HI> which he brought one Morning, when he was obliged to attend her Maje&s;ty early, as a Token, that, for Di&s;patch, he had rode 120 Miles &s;ince he took leave of her late the Night before. But &s;uch a Number of Jewels, which might be call'd Extravagance in others, was no Expence to Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> who had many other Kinds of Trea&s;ure, as well as this in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prizes, or otherwi&s;e in Traffick with foreign Nati|ons; and as for his &s;tately Appearance in, by wear|ing of them upon &s;ome &s;pecial Occa&s;ions, it is not only confirm'd by Circum&s;tances, in part before-mentioned, but al&s;o by &s;ome Authors; who are not expected to take Notice of it with great Com|mendation:

This unfortunate Event, which he was above &s;hun|ning, by trimming and tempori&s;ing in a Matter which he knew &s;o highly concern'd the Honour and Advantage of his Country, he has him&s;elf &s;o excellently accounted for, where he &s;hews the ill Succe&s;s which attends &s;uch &s;incere Conduct, and how Pro&s;perity is the Fruit of &s;lavi&s;h or hypocritical Compliances; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a curious Di&s;cour&s;e, where he Learnedly and Religi|ou&s;ly reconciles Fortune with Rea&s;on and Providence, <HI>Ralegh</HI> has the&s;e Words. "But may it be objected, that, if <HI>Fortune</HI> and <HI>Chance</HI> were not &s;ometimes the Cau&s;es of <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil</HI> in Men, but an idle Voice whereby we expre&s;s <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> how comes it then, that &s;o many worthy and wi&s;e Men depend upon &s;o many unworthy and empty-headed Fools? That Riches and Honour are given to external Men, and without Kernel; and &s;o many Learned, Virtuous and Valiant Men, wear out their Lives in poor and dejected E&s;tates? In a Word, there is no other inferior or apparent Cau&s;e, be&s;ides the Partiality of Men's Affection, but <HI>the Fa&s;hioning and not Fa&s;hioning our&s;elves according to the Nature of the Times wherein we live.</HI> For who&s;oever is mo&s;t able, and be&s;t &s;ufficient to di&s;cern, and has withal an hone&s;t and open Heart, and loving Truth; if Princes, or tho&s;e who Govern, endure no other Di&s;cour&s;e than their own Flatteries; then, I &s;ay, &s;uch a one, who&s;e Virtue and Courage forbids him to be ba&s;e, and a Di&s;&s;embler, &s;hall evermore hang under the Wheel; which kind of de&s;erving well, and receiving ill, we always fal&s;ely charge Fortune withal: For who&s;oever &s;hall tell any Great Man, or Magi&s;trate, that he is not Ju&s;t; the General of an Army, that he is not Valiant; and great Ladies, that they are not Fair; &s;hall never be made a Coun&s;ellor, a Cap|tain, or a Courtier. Neither is it &s;ufficient to be Wi&s;e with a Wi&s;e Prince, Valiant with a Valiant, and Ju&s;t with him that is Ju&s;t, for &s;uch a one has no E&s;tate in his Pro&s;perity; but he mu&s;t al&s;o <HI>change with the Succe&s;&s;or,</HI> if he be of <HI>contrary Qualities;</HI> &s;ail with the Tide of the Time, and alter Form and Condition, as the State or States-ma&s;ter changes: Otherwi&s;e, how were it po&s;&s;ible that the mo&s;t ba&s;e Men, and &s;eparate from all imitable Qualities, could &s;o often attain to Honour and Riches, but by &s;uch an ob&s;ervant &s;lavi&s;h Cour&s;e?" A little further, having quoted out of <HI>Menander,</HI> "That every Fool is won with his own Pride, and the flattering Applau&s;e of others; he infers, That who&s;oever will live altogether out of him&s;elf, &s;tudy other Men's Humours, and ob&s;erve them, &s;hall never be Unfortunate. On the contrary, that Man, who prizes Truth and Virtue, ex|cept the Sea&s;on wherein he lives be of the&s;e, and all Sorts of Goodne&s;s, Fruitful, &s;hall never pro&s;per by the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or Profe&s;&s;ion thereof." So, after other learned Authorities and proper Examples, concludes with the following ingenious Allu|&s;ions, "Who&s;oever therefore will &s;et before him <HI>Machiavel</HI>'s two <HI>Marks</HI> to &s;hoot at, <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> mu&s;t &s;et on and take off, a back of Iron to a weak Wooden Bow, that he may fit both the Strong and the Feeble. For as he, who fir&s;t de|vi&s;ed to add Sails to rowing Ve&s;&s;els, did either &s;o proportion them, as being fa&s;tened aloft, and towards the Head of his Ma&s;t, he might abide all Winds and Storms, or el&s;e he &s;ome Time or other peri&s;h'd by his own Invention: So that Man, who prizes Virtue for it&s;elf, and cannot endure to hoi&s;t and &s;trike Sail, as the divers Natures of Calms and Storms require, mu&s;t cut his Sails and his Cloth of mean Length and Breadth, and content him&s;elf with a &s;low and &s;ure Navigation; to wit, a mean and free E&s;tate."

Thus have we &s;een &s;everal Circum&s;tances, and the&s;e are all I have met with in this Interval, whereby <HI>Ralegh</HI> might unde&s;ignedly, and unluck|ily become di&s;agreeable to a Man of King <HI>James</HI>'s Temper; but, on the other &s;ide, little or nothing that could &s;o inflame <HI>Ralegh</HI> again&s;t the King, as to make him run headlong into &s;uch violent Con|&s;piracies, as could only end in his own Ruin. Suppo&s;e the King did di&s;courage <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Attend|ance upon him at his Entrance, di&s;like his Patent for Wines, or removed him from the Guards, to oblige Sir <HI>Thomas Er&s;kine,</HI> his Countryman and Favourite, whom he afterwards prefer'd to higher Dignities; and this is all I have met with that could give Offence on the King's part: will this be thought &s;ufficient Provocation for a Man of <HI>Ra|legh</HI>'s Rea&s;on and Judgment, &s;o tender of Fame and Reputation, &s;o &s;ettled in Family, &s;o well &s;i|tuated in his Fortune, no le&s;s than 3000<HI>l.</HI> a Year, as was confe&s;s'd at his Trial, be&s;ides many other profitable, and I may &s;ay princely Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the Seas, as well as the Land, to plot Commotions or In&s;urrections; yet enervate him&s;elf for the Exe|cution of them, by re&s;igning, as he &s;ays him&s;elf he did, his Office of chiefe&s;t Power, the Ward&s;hip of the <HI>Stannaries?</HI> Nay, further, to herd with a motley and disjointed Crew of Prie&s;ts, al&s;o with profe&s;s'd Enemies to him&s;elf, not to mention Knaves and Fools; and, on a &s;udden, re&s;olve to turn Re|bel, Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ian and Cut-throat; to be the <HI>Coryphaeus,</HI>
<PB N="327" REF="337">
to murder the King with his own Hand, and all his innocent Progeny! for this is the Charge that the fertile Pens of <HI>French</HI> Writers have heap'd up|on him. Indeed, I was &s;omewhat &s;tartled, when I read it in a Hi&s;tory that bears the Name and Character of <HI>Thuanus,</HI> though I thought he might po&s;&s;ibly come at it by mini&s;terial Direction to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident, till at la&s;t I found his Author to be no other than one of his own Countrymen, whom <HI>Camden,</HI> as I have before ob&s;erv'd, has refuted in other Pa&s;&s;ages that are even more credible. Now the&s;e tell over this de&s;perate Story thus. In the Month of <HI>June</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh, a Man equally dexterous at Con&s;ultation or Action,</HI> &s;ays Thuanus, <HI>and famous for his memorable Expeditions to the</HI> In|dies, taking Leave of his Si&s;ter at <HI>London,</HI> intreat|ed her to commend him to God in her Prayers, for he was going to a Place from whence he expected never to return. She, &s;u&s;pecting that he was go|ing to fight a Duel, with the &s;ame Levity di&s;per&s;ed it among the Ladies of her Acquaintance, 'till the Rumour came to Court. Then <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Friends and Relations flocked about him to know this En|terpri&s;e; he, apprehending him&s;elf detected, rea|dily made a whole Confe&s;&s;ion and Di&s;covery of the Matter. The King was informed, and greatly a&s;toni&s;hed, but would needs have <HI>Ralegh</HI> before him, who, then a&s;king his Pardon, acknowledg'd, that &s;eeing his Maje&s;ty give more Countenance to the <HI>Scots</HI> than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and had deprived him of his Command in the Guards, and that many great Men expected, when he was e&s;tabli&s;hed on the Throne, he would be revenged for the Death of his Mother, he had therefore entered into a Con|&s;piracy with others, whom he named, to &s;hed his Royal Blood; and that they had unanimou&s;ly de|puted him to be his Maje&s;ty's Executioner, when
<PB N="328" REF="338">
he rode a hunting. Hereupon the &s;aid Con&s;pira|tors were taken up and tried, as the&s;e Authors pro|ceed to relate. If there had been any Truth in this ridiculous Story, which I think no one before has taken the Pains to relate in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that Confe&s;&s;ion had neither e&s;caped the Attorney General <HI>Coke</HI> at <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Trial, when they were &s;o lamely put to it to bring him in guilty without &s;ufficient Proof, nor King <HI>James</HI>'sapologetical Declaration after <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Death, in which his Maje&s;ty and his Council toge|ther, have no le&s;s lamely offered weaker Rea&s;ons for taking away his Life, as will be fully repre|&s;ented in its proper Place.</P>
<P>By our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Accounts it appears there was &s;omewhat of a Plot, but it was never proved that <HI>Ralegh</HI> was engaged in it; however, his great Ene|my, the Attorney-general <HI>Coke,</HI> affected to com|pare him with the Con&s;pirators, <HI>to</HI> Samp&s;on<HI>'s Foxes, which were joined in the Tails, though their Heads were &s;evered.</HI> What Share he had in that Plot may further be judged by the Promotions which the Con&s;pirators intended them&s;elves upon the Succe&s;s of it; for whereas one was to be Lord-chancellor, another Lord-mar&s;hal, this Lord-trea&s;urer, that Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, and t'other Secretary of State: how comes it, as one Author well ob&s;erves, that <HI>Ralegh,</HI> able to officiate any, had no Office in the State a&s;&s;ign'd him? But perhaps the be&s;t Means to clear him, may be the very <HI>Trial</HI> by which he was condemn'd. 'Tis too common, and too tedious, to be thought needful of tran&s;cribing it here at length; not to &s;ay &s;o full of barbarous Partiality and foul Language, e&s;pecially by <HI>Coke</HI> him&s;elf, that he was expo&s;ed for it upon the publick Theatre; and tho&s;e, who revere the Laws of our Country, have been &s;o a&s;hamed of it, as rather to wi&s;h the Proceedings have been fal&s;ely related, than believe
<PB N="329" REF="339">
&s;uch a Sentence could pa&s;s upon &s;uch in&s;ufficient Evidence. But the Character of this <HI>Trial,</HI> and of that <HI>Attorney General,</HI> I leave to others; and &s;hall here only, from the &s;everal Copies or Ac|counts of it I have met with, draw out a &s;hort re|gular Narrative of the mo&s;t material Matters of Fact, wherein <HI>Ralegh</HI> appears any way concern'd; and it is as follows:</P>
<P>There was one <HI>Matthew de Laurencie,</HI> a Mer|chant of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> Attendant on Count <HI>Aremberg,</HI> who now, about the Beginning of <HI>June,</HI> came over Amba&s;&s;ador-extraordinary from <HI>Albert,</HI> Arch-duke of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> to congratulate King <HI>James,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;t in compo&s;ing the General Peace. With this Mer|chant the Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> had held Intelligence &s;ome Years before, upon Matters of State, with Licence. Five Days after <HI>Aremberg</HI>'s Arrival, that is to &s;ay, about the 9th of the &s;ame Month, <HI>Cobham</HI> repair'd to him with <HI>Laurencie,</HI> and that Night <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;upp'd, with Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> at <HI>Durham-hou&s;e</HI> in the <HI>Strand;</HI> whereby <HI>Ralegh</HI> came to under&s;tand, that <HI>Cobham</HI> had fre&s;h Negociations with <HI>Aremberg;</HI> and was, as the chief of tho&s;e who refu&s;ed the Peace, offered a Sum of Money by <HI>Cobham</HI> to be a Promoter of it; tho' that Offer, al&s;o made to <HI>Ra|legh</HI> before <HI>Aremberg</HI> came, was afterwards pre|tended, as will appear, to have been for trea&s;on|able Purpo&s;es. In the next Month, tho&s;e Per&s;ons with whom <HI>Cobham</HI> tran&s;acted the Con&s;piracy (or part of it) then on foot, were di&s;cover'd; either by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Faction in revenge to <HI>Ralegh,</HI> the greate&s;t Enemy of <HI>Spain</HI> alive, thinking he was then too far hamper'd in, or acquainted with it to e&s;cape; or by &s;ome one of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;pira|tors to &s;ecure him&s;elf: And, when the Lord <HI>Cecyll</HI> (for he was lately made Baron of <HI>E&s;&s;enden)</HI> found, upon the fir&s;t News of <HI>Anthony Copley,</HI> one of the&s;e
<PB N="330" REF="340">
Con&s;pirators, who was apprehended the 6th of <HI>July,</HI> that the King's Per&s;on was to be &s;urpriz'd by the Lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Wilton,</HI> and <HI>George Brook,</HI> Bro|ther to the Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> he &s;u&s;pected <HI>Cobham</HI> him&s;elf was in the Secret; and <HI>Cobham</HI>'s great In|timacy with <HI>Ralegh</HI> at this Time, who was now buying an E&s;tate for him, and &s;ettling his Hou&s;hold Affairs, drew <HI>Ralegh</HI> al&s;o into Su&s;picion.</P>
<P>Hereupon <HI>Cecyll,</HI> meeting <HI>Ralegh</HI> upon <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Terrace, tells him, <HI>the Lords of the Council had &s;omething to &s;ay to him:</HI> &s;o he was examined about the &s;urpri&s;ing Trea&s;on, and particularly about <HI>Cob|ham,</HI> as appears from his own Words, whom he fully cleared. After Examination, <HI>Ralegh</HI> further &s;aid: <HI>What&s;oever Corre&s;pondence there was between</HI> Cobham <HI>and</HI> Aremberg, Laurencie <HI>might be better able to give Account of it, therefore advi&s;ed to the calling upon him;</HI> though, as he further explained, <HI>he knew of no Intelligence between them, but &s;uch as might be warranted:</HI> And that Advice he wrote al&s;o in a Letter to <HI>Cecyll.</HI> When <HI>Ralegh</HI> returned from Examination a private Pri&s;oner to his own Hou&s;e, <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;ent him to know what had pa&s;s'd; <HI>Ralegh</HI> writ an An&s;wer by Capt. <HI>Feymis, that he was examin'd, and had clear'd him of all;</HI> and <HI>Key|mis</HI> bid <HI>Cobham be of good Comfort, for one Witne&s;s could not condemn him:</HI> This Precaution, to arm <HI>Cobham</HI> again&s;t making Di&s;coveries, was, after his Confe&s;&s;ion of it, objected again&s;t <HI>Ralegh;</HI> but he utterly deny'd, that he &s;ent any &s;uch verbal Me&s;|&s;age. Now when <HI>Cobham</HI> was brought to his Ex|amination at <HI>Richmond,</HI> one Date whereof appears to have been <HI>July</HI> 18; and after he had, by a con|&s;tant Denial, cleared both him&s;elf and <HI>Ralegh</HI> of all that was que&s;tion'd again&s;t them, <HI>Cobham</HI> was, by Device, &s;ays my Author (in an Epi&s;tolary Nar|rative of his Trial, at which he was pre&s;ent) in|duced
<PB N="331" REF="341">
to think, that <HI>Ralegh</HI> had fir&s;t impeach'd and betray'd him. For that Part of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Let|ter afore&s;aid to <HI>Cecyll,</HI> referring the Lords to <HI>Lau|rencie</HI> for <HI>Cobham</HI>'s Tran&s;actions with <HI>Aremberg,</HI> being &s;hewed to <HI>Cobham,</HI> and accompanied, it &s;eems, with &s;uch artful Sugge&s;tions as were proper to inflame a Man of <HI>Cobham</HI>'s Weakne&s;s, had the de&s;ired Effect; for he being led thereby to imagine that <HI>Ralegh</HI> had accus'd him of all, or more than he knew, bur&s;t out into vehement Exclamations again&s;t <HI>Ralegh,</HI> and in his Rage, or Madne&s;s, made the following Confe&s;&s;ion. <HI>That having a Pa&s;&s;port to go to the</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>King, he intended fir&s;t to confer with the Archduke; and, becau&s;e he knew he had not Money to pay his own Army, meant from thence to go to</HI> Spain, <HI>to deal with the King for</HI> 600,0000 <HI>Crowns, then to return by</HI> Jer&s;ey; <HI>and that nothing &s;hould be done about the Di&s;tribution of that Money to the Di&s;|contented in</HI> England, <HI>till he had &s;poken with Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh: <HI>Further, that he had never enter'd into the&s;e Cour&s;es, but by his In&s;tigation. He &s;pake al&s;o of Plots, but of the Particulars could give no Ac|count; yet acknowledg'd he was afraid that</HI> Ralegh, <HI>upon his Return to</HI> Jer&s;ey, <HI>would have him and the Money to the King.</HI> After all this, before <HI>Cobham</HI> departed to the Stair-foot, he retracted his Confe&s;|&s;ion, and profe&s;s'd he had done <HI>Ralegh</HI> wrong: Nor does it appear, &s;ays my Author, that he did &s;ub&s;cribe it. In another Branch of his Examina|tion, <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;aid he had of <HI>Ralegh</HI> a Book, writ|ten again&s;t the King's Title, which he gave to his Brother <HI>Brook,</HI> and that <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;aid it was fooli&s;hly written. But this he al&s;o retracted, as we &s;hall hear. Upon this, and other Parts of his Confe&s;|&s;ion more foreign to <HI>Ralegh,</HI> concerning the Ad|vancement of Lady <HI>Arabella Stuart</HI> to the Crown, as al&s;o from that of <HI>George Brook,</HI> a known Enemy

Three Days afterwards <HI>Cobham</HI> and <HI>Grey</HI> were al&s;o in|dicted at the &s;ame Place; and, not long after this, they were all three return'd Pri&s;oners to the Tower of <HI>London.</HI> When the Time of their Trial drew nigh, that is to &s;ay in the Beginning of <HI>November, Ralegh</HI> got a poor Fellow in the Tower to ca&s;t up a Letter, fa&s;ten'd to an Apple, in at <HI>Cobham</HI>'s Window, while the Lieutenant was at Supper, to intreat him (becau&s;e he then knew not but <HI>Cobham</HI> might be arraign'd before him:) <HI>for God's &s;ake, to do him Ju&s;tice by his An&s;wer, and &s;ignify to him, that he had wronged him in his Accu&s;ation;</HI> and <HI>Cobham</HI> did, by an An&s;wer under his Hand, confe&s;s the &s;ame; which not being perhaps &s;o full and expre&s;&s;ive as <HI>Ralegh</HI> expected, he afterwards &s;ent <HI>Cobham</HI> another Letter, de&s;iring he would pub|li&s;h his Innocence at his Arraignment.

<P>And here <HI>Cobham</HI> having been prevailed on to make fre&s;h Accu&s;ations in a Letter to the Lords, at lea&s;t &s;ub&s;crib'd with his Name, which will be produced a little further, <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Trial was fir&s;t brought on; and this was on the 17th of the Month afore&s;aid.

Here <HI>Ralegh</HI> fir&s;t &s;hewed the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s and Improbability of the Accu&s;ation therein again&s;t him, as follows: <HI>It is &s;trange for me,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to devi&s;e with</HI> Cobham, <HI>that he &s;hould go to</HI> Spain <HI>to per&s;uade the King to di&s;bur&s;e &s;o much Money, he being a Man of no Love in</HI> England; <HI>and I ha|ving re&s;igned my Room of chiefe&s;t Command, the War|den&s;hip of the</HI> Stannaries; <HI>it is &s;trange for me to make my&s;elf a</HI> Robin Hood, <HI>or a</HI> Ket, <HI>or a</HI> Cade, <HI>I know|ing</HI> England <HI>to be in a better State than ever it was. I knew</HI> Scotland <HI>united,</HI> Ireland <HI>quieted,</HI> Denmark <HI>a&s;&s;ured, which before was &s;u&s;pected. I knew, that having a Lady, whom Time had &s;urpri&s;ed, we had now a lawful Succe&s;&s;or. The State of</HI> Spain <HI>was not unknown to me. I had written a Di&s;cour&s;e, which I intended to pre&s;ent unto the King again&s;t the Peace with</HI> Spain. <HI>I knew the</HI> Spaniard <HI>had &s;ix Repul&s;es, three in</HI> Ireland, <HI>and three at Sea; and once in</HI> 1588, <HI>by my Lord-admiral, al&s;o at</HI> Cadiz. <HI>I knew he was di&s;couraged and di&s;honoured. I knew the King of</HI> Spain <HI>to be the proude&s;t Prince living, but now he comes creeping to my Ma&s;ter for a Peace.

I never came to the Lord</HI> Cobham<HI>'s but about Matters of his Profit, as the ordering of his Hou&s;e; and I had of his, when I was examined, four thou&s;and Pounds worth of Jewels for a Purcha&s;e, a Pearl of three thou&s;and Pounds, and a Ring worth five hundred Pounds. If he had had a Fancy to run away, he would not have left &s;o much Money to have pur|cha&s;ed a Lea&s;e in Fee-farm. I &s;aw him buy three hundred Pounds worth of Books to &s;end to his Library at</HI> Canterbury, <HI>and a Cabinet of three hundred Pounds to give Mr.</HI> Attorney <HI>for drawing the Con|veyances; and God in Heaven knows, not I, whe|ther he intended to travel: But for the Practice with</HI> Arabella, <HI>or Letters to</HI> Aremberg, <HI>or any Di&s;cour&s;e with him, or in what Language he &s;pake unto him; if I knew any of the&s;e Things, I would ab&s;olutely con|fe&s;s the Indictment, and acknowledge my&s;elf worthy of a thou&s;and Deaths.</HI> And a little further concern|ing <HI>Cobham</HI>'s Examination: <HI>He that hath been ex|amined, has ever been a&s;ked if it be according to his Meaning, and then to &s;ub&s;cribe.

If I had been the Plotter, would not I have given</HI> Cobham <HI>&s;ome Arguments, whereby to per&s;uade the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>and an&s;wer his Objections?

his ever having &s;aid &s;uch Words. <HI>Brook,</HI> who had pretended he did &s;ay them, was allowed to have been <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Enemy; &s;o the Expre&s;&s;ion was not proved. Another Matter they kept &s;ome Coil about was, the Book <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;aid he had of <HI>Ralegh,</HI> written again&s;t the King's Title. This was nothing more than a <HI>Defence of the Queen's Pro|ceedings again&s;t</HI> Mary <HI>Queen of</HI> Scotland, written by one <HI>Robert Snag,</HI> a Lawyer, and found by <HI>Ralegh</HI> in the Library of the late Lord-trea&s;urer <HI>Burghley,</HI> which he had Liberty of &s;earching for &s;ome geo|graphical De&s;criptions of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.

<PB N="337" REF="347">
<HI>nothing at all was proved; nor touching the Inva&s;ion here, or Sedition in</HI> Scotland, <HI>or even the De&s;truction of the King, &amp;c.

The Circum&s;tances of his Trial, in which the Court always over-ruled the Pri&s;oner, were &s;omewhat like the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s; he complained of the ill U&s;age of the King's Coun&s;el, as well as the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el;</HI> and both had Rea|&s;on &s;o to do.

<HI>That</HI> Ralegh <HI>expected nothing le&s;s than this Kind of Treatment from tho&s;e Hands, is plain by the Letter which he wrote to the King him&s;elf ju&s;t before his Trial; wherein having &s;aid,</HI> I know, that, among many Pre&s;umptions gathered again&s;t me, your Maje&s;ty has been per&s;uaded, that I was one of tho&s;e who were greatly di&s;contented, and therefore the more likely to prove di&s;loyal; but the great God of Heaven and Earth di&s;claim me from both Worlds, if I were not the contrary, and if I took not great Com|fort to behold your Maje&s;ty always learning &s;ome Good, and bettering my Knowledge by your Maje&s;ty's Di&s;cour&s;e: And having humbly be&s;eeched him not to believe any of tho&s;e, who, under Pretence of Offences to Kings, do ea&s;ily work their particular Revenge; <HI>he &s;ays a little further,</HI> For my Part, I prote&s;t before the ever-living God, that I never intended Trea&s;on, con&s;ented to Trea&s;on, or performed Trea&s;on again&s;t you; and yet I know I &s;hall fall into their Hands, <HI>&egrave; quibus non po&s;&s;um evadere,</HI> unle&s;s by your Maje&s;ty's gracious Compa&s;&s;ion I be &s;u&s;tained. <HI>Another Letter, which he wrote to the Lords, gives us &s;ome further Light or A&s;&s;urance, that the Offer made to him for one Intention, and to others for another, was con&s;trued as made to him for both; where, &s;peak|ing of the two principal Accu&s;ations again&s;t him, he &s;ays,</HI> the fir&s;t was, that Money was offered me

For the fir&s;t, it &s;eems, this Money was of|fered to others long after it was offered to me, and upon other Con&s;iderations than it was to me. For my&s;elf I avow, upon my Allegiance, that I never knew or &s;u&s;pected either the Man or the new Inten|tion. To me it was but once propounded, and in three Weeks after I never heard more of it; neither did I belive that he had any Commi&s;&s;ion to offer it; for, it that Word Amity had been u&s;ed to me Co|lourably, I mu&s;t have been al&s;o made acquainted with the true End for which it &s;hould have been given; which it &s;eems was for the Surprize: But of any &s;uch horrible Purpo&s;e, if ever I had &s;o much as a Su&s;pi|cion, I refu&s;e your Lord&s;hips Favour, and the King's Mercy. I know your Lord&s;hips have omitted nothing to find out the Truth; but, as you have not err'd, like ill Surgeons, to lay on Plai&s;ters too narrow for &s;o great Wounds, &s;o I tru&s;t that you will not imitate un|learned Phy&s;icians, to give Medicines more cruel than the Di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf. For the Journey into <HI>Spain,</HI> I know I was accu&s;ed to be privy thereto; but I know your Lord&s;hips have a Reputation of Con&s;cience, as well as Indu&s;try. By what means that revengeful Accu&s;ation was &s;tirr'd, you, my Lord <HI>Cecyll,</HI> know right well, that it was my Letter about <HI>Keymis;</HI> and your Lord&s;hips all know whether it be maintain'd, or whether, out of Truth, and out of a Chri&s;tian Con&s;ideration, it be revoked. <HI>A little further he &s;ays,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the King's Coun&s;el, in <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Trial, u&s;ed Arguments, grounded on Pre&s;umptions, to prove him Guilty; &s;o did he there al&s;o u&s;e others to clear him&s;elf, grounded on the&s;e of his great Expences again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and his having always been &s;uch a noted Enemy to their Faction.

<P>If the&s;e Letters had any good Effect, it appear|ed not immediately, <HI>Ralegh</HI> being kept near a Month at <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> after he was condemned, in daily Expectation of Death. We find, that when the Report of the Arraignments was made to the King in his Privy&punc;chamber at <HI>Wilton,</HI> he carried him&s;elf &s;o re&s;ervedly, that no Body could gue&s;s how well he was &s;atisfied with the Equality of Con|demnation, till he made, him&s;elf, a Difference in the Puni&s;hment. The two Prie&s;ts were executed on the 29th of <HI>November,</HI> and <HI>George Brook</HI> on the 5th of <HI>December</HI> following. His Maje&s;ty al&s;o &s;ign'd Warrants for <HI>Cobham, Grey</HI> and <HI>Markham,</HI> to be beheaded on the 9th Day of the &s;aid Month. But, in the particular <HI>Narrative</HI> of this proceed|ing to Execution, <HI>Ralegh</HI> is not &s;o much as men|tion'd: and this might be owing to the extraordi|nary Di&s;appointment of that Purgation, which was expected from one of tho&s;e three next to be executed; for the Day afore&s;aid being come, <HI>Markham</HI> was fir&s;t brought to the Scaffold; and, having ended his Speech, Prayers, with all he had to &s;ay, and being on his Knees, ready to receive the Stroke of the Ax, up &s;teps <HI>John Gibb,</HI> Groom of the King's Bed-chamber, to Sir <HI>Benjamin Tich|bourne,</HI> the Sheriff of <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> with his Maje&s;ty's Warrant to &s;tay the Execution; &s;o <HI>Markham</HI> was told he mu&s;t withdraw a while into the Hall, to be confronted by the Lords.

afore&s;aid; then was he al&s;o call'd a&s;ide.

<P>But <HI>Ralegh,</HI> it &s;eems, did la&s;t ta&s;te of it, and for no other apparent Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e he was the

It is too long to recite in this Place, be&s;ides has been often printed, and may be ea&s;ily met with in his Works. The hi&s;torical Pa&s;&s;ages in it acquaint us, that his Lands were conveyed to his Son, as is before mentioned; that he intended his Wife the Profits of his Wine-office, half his Goods, and all his Jewels, except &s;ome one to his Son; that <HI>Baily</HI> owed him two hundred, or as other Editions have it, 1000 Pounds; and his Bro|ther <HI>Adrian Gilber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> &s;ix hundred; that he had al&s;o much Money owing him in <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> be&s;ides the Ar|rearages of the Wines, which would pay all his Debts.

Thus <HI>Weldon,</HI> p. 37, &amp;c. <HI>O&s;borne</HI> al&s;o, much to the &s;ame Sen&s;e, tells us, from the Autho|rity of <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> that <HI>Cobham</HI> died in a Room a&s;cended by a Ladder, at a poor Woman's Hou&s;e in the <HI>Minories,</HI> formerly his Laundre&s;s, rather of Hunger, than of any more na|tural Di&s;ea&s;e.

<P>But to return to more early Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Impri&s;onment, and to con&s;ider his State, as it ap|pears at his Entrance therein, we may very ea&s;ily believe, he was at fir&s;t in very great Trouble to be &s;o &s;uddenly, and in &s;uch a Manner, depriv'd of Power, Fortune, Liberty and Reputation; but find nothing to confirm the extraordinary Dejecti|on one Writer, de&s;cribes him under, where he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'In the publick Joy and Jubilee of the whole Realm, when Favour, Peace and Pardon were of|fered even to Offenders; he, who in Wit, in Wealth, in Courage, was inferior to few, fell &s;uddenly (he cannot tell how) into &s;uch a down|fall of De&s;pair, that his greate&s;t Enemies would not have wi&s;hed him &s;o much Harm, as he would have done him&s;elf;'</Q> for we have &s;een he had Enemies, who would have done him the Injury that could not

Indeed, the Affairs of a Per&s;on, who had &s;uch various and exten&s;ive Dealings or Com|merce with Mankind, could not but be &s;omewhat perplexed and embarra&s;s'd, upon a Fall &s;o &s;udden and precipitous; therefore, to find him employing Agents for collecting in Debts, and &s;atisfying Cre|ditors, is to be expected. Thus, in one of his Let|ters to Sir <HI>Michael Hext,</HI> he de&s;ires him to &s;pare <HI>John Shellbury</HI> for a little Time, he being bound for him in a Sum of fifteen hundred Pounds; and, if he was re&s;trained, &s;o that he could not recover the Wine-arrearages, which (as we find from <HI>Ra|legh</HI>'s Letter before to his Wife) would clear all his Debts, they mu&s;t remain unpaid. The Date en|dors'd upon this Letter, probably by Sir <HI>Michael</HI> him&s;elf, is <HI>November</HI> 12, 1604. In the Middle of <HI>February</HI> following, we find a Grant made by the King, to that <HI>John Shellbury</HI> and another Per|&s;on, to this Effect: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> late of <HI>Sherborne,</HI> &amp;c. being attainted of High Trea|&s;on, whereby all his Goods and Chattels, Real and Per&s;onal, Moveable and Immoveable; Debts, Duties, Sums of Money, Bonds, &amp;c. are forfeited.

<P>Thus we &s;ee a great Di&s;tinction made already be|tween him and <HI>Cobham,</HI> and &s;hall find more Favour extending towards him in a little while. 'Tis &s;aid to be much owing to the earne&s;t and unwearied In|terce&s;&s;ions of his Lady at Court, who, that &s;he might be more &s;erviceable to him, &s;oon after he was committed to the <HI>Tower,</HI> petition'd the King, that &s;he might be a Pri&s;oner with her Hu&s;band, or live with him there in his Confinement; and her Reque&s;t was granted. Here, manife&s;tly after the Grant afore&s;aid to <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Tru&s;tees, becau&s;e that mentions but one of his Sons, &s;he was deli|vered of the other, and he was Chri&s;ten'd <HI>Carew,</HI> who was yet born, as Authors compute, within the Year above-mentioned. To this Satisfaction, <HI>Ralegh</HI> had others afterwards, which greatly alle|viated the lo&s;s of his Liberty; &s;o that his re&s;traint, which was intended as a Mortification, his Pru|dence in Time &s;o converted, that it proved only a Retirement, or the quiet Enjoyment of a dome&s;tick Life; and he felt certain Comforts ari&s;e from the con&s;tant Company of his little Family, which in the Pomp of Courts, the Pride of Conque&s;ts, the Glory of Di&s;coveries, and the Sweetne&s;s of Free|dom it&s;elf, he had never ta&s;ted. But this Tran|quillity appears not to have &s;uddenly arrived, be|ing for a while dive&s;ted of all his E&s;tate; and having &s;ome Contentions at Law with tho&s;e who were con&s;iderably indebted to him, and could not otherwi&s;e be brought to Account;

beautiful Lady. For Beauty (&s;ays he) it was never more cheap in any Age; and it is ever better loved in the Hope, than when it is had: For the Million of Crowns offered, which makes but two of our Sub&s;idies, I &s;peak it confidently; that when tho&s;e Dukes, Lords, and great Ladies, who will attend the Prince&s;s in her Pa&s;&s;age hither, &s;hall be all pre&s;ented with Gifts according to their Degrees and the King's Honour; when the Preparations, Triumphs and Fea&s;tings are paid for, there will nothing remain but a great En|crea&s;e of Charge, and, perchance, a great deal of Melancholly. <HI>And a little further,</HI> Ralegh <HI>comes clo&s;er &s;till, to the Prince him&s;elf, in the&s;e Words:</HI> Now, if by the&s;e Di&s;likes of the former Alliances, you make Judgment that it is my De&s;ire that the Prince &s;hould not marry at all; I &s;ay, my De&s;ire is not, that the Prince &s;hould not marry at all, but not as yet; and I am exceeding Sorry that the Prince has not the &s;ame De&s;ire. For &s;eeing his Maje&s;ty is yet but young, and by God's Favour like to live many Years; and that his Highne&s;s, if he &s;hould now mar|ry may have many Children born to him, before he be <HI>30</HI> Years old; and, &s;eeing all his Children &s;hall be Princes, and mu&s;t be provided for as Princes, I think it will much perplex him to find him&s;elf &s;o en|vironed, 'till his Maje&s;ty has &s;omewhat repaired his E&s;tate, and provided beautiful Gardens to plant the&s;e Olive Branches in. While the Prince is unmarried, all the Eyes of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> are upon him; for, with what King &s;oever he &s;hall be ballanced, he will ca&s;t the Scale; but, to have him weighed with a little Prince, I &s;hould be &s;orry, and he him&s;elf will be as &s;orry after.

For the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> namely the Comfort and Contentment of this worthy young Lady by this Match, as there is little in Ap|pearance pre&s;ently, &s;o there is le&s;s to be hoped for in the future. For, as first, &s;he mu&s;t be removed far from her neare&s;t Blood, both by Father and Mother, into a Country far e&s;tranged from our Nation, as any part of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and as far differing from us in Religion, as in Climate. And what true Corre&s;pondence, or matrimonial Affection, there can be maintain'd between tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who&s;e Minds are different, and oppo&s;ite in the religious Points of their Chri&s;tian Faith, is greatly to be doubted. Moreover it is greatly to be feared, with what Safety and Security &s;he can long live free from &s;ecret Pra|ctices and Treacheries, in a Country &s;o near the Pope's Juri&s;diction, environ'd with the Plots of the Je&s;uits, who, we &s;ee, do daily traffick the Lives and Fortunes of all Princes who are not wholly de|voted to the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Obedience; and therefore how they will entertain or tolerate the Race of our King, were too great an Error and Pre&s;umption to tru&s;t to: So as when the worthy Lady, hereafter by her Children or otherwi&s;e, has furni&s;h'd their De&s;ire, and fully &s;erved their Turn, &s;he &s;hall be then either forced to wound her Con&s;cience, by for&s;aking her Faith, or el&s;e to undergo the Scorns and Danger which &s;hall be daily ca&s;t upon her and her Family, for the Exerci&s;e of her Religion. And this al&s;o we may be well a&s;&s;ured of, that, if &s;he &s;hall have any I&s;&s;ue by the Prince of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> they mu&s;t all be bred and brought up contrary to her Con&s;cience, which can be no &s;mall Grief to a virtuous and natural Mother, and as little Comfort to our just religious King, their Grandfather. La&s;tly, the very binding Cau&s;e of Amity between all Kings, Princes and States, is their Trade and Intercour&s;e of their Subjects. Now

there is not any Prince or State of <HI>Europe,</HI> the in|land Countries of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> ex|cepted, but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have Trade withal; yea even with the <HI>Turk, Barbarian, Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>In|dians;</HI> only with the Subjects of <HI>Savoy,</HI> I do not know that we have any meddling or interchange at at all: for the Duke has no Port, his Ditch of <HI>Villa Franca</HI> excepted, which is only capable of a few Gallies, either to furni&s;h Ships from, or to re|ceive them, being Strangers. And therefore for his Maje&s;ty of <HI>England</HI> to match his elde&s;t and only Daughter with a Prince, who has his Dependance on other Kings; a Prince je&s;uited, who can neither head us in Time of War, nor trade with us in Time of Peace; a Prince, by the Situation of his Country, every Way unprofitable to us; and that, no le&s;s pe|rilous for his Maje&s;ty's Daughter to live in: I re|&s;olve my&s;elf, that he is of too excellent a Judgment ever to accept of it, and his honourable Council too wi&s;e and provident to advi&s;e the Pro&s;ecution thereof.

So he proceeds to explain, fir&s;t the Virtues of every individual Drug, which, together, cau&s;e tho&s;e rare Effects this Cordial daily produces (&s;ays he) as well towards the Healthful as the Sick. Secondly, He &s;pecifies how Art helps Nature in the harmonious and exqui&s;ite Method of the Preparation.

For, having &s;poken of the particular E&s;teem which Prince <HI>Henry</HI> had con|tracted for Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> the con&s;tant Corre|&s;pondence he kept with him by Letters and Me&s;|&s;ages, and of the Sollicitations he had &s;o repeatedly made to the King for his Liberty, as what might contribute towards his Maje&s;ty's per&s;onal Prejudice again&s;t <HI>Ralegh,</HI> he adds: <HI>When the Prince fell into his la&s;t Illne&s;s, the Queen &s;ent to Sir</HI> Walter Ra|legh <HI>for &s;ome of his</HI> Cordial, <HI>which &s;he her&s;elf had taken in a Fever &s;ome Time before, with remarkable Succe&s;s.</HI> Ralegh <HI>&s;ent it, together with a Letter to the Queen, wherein he expre&s;s'd a tender Concern for the Prince; and, boa&s;ting of his Medicine, &s;tumbled unluckily upon an Expre&s;&s;ion to this Purpo&s;e,</HI> That it would certainly cure him, or any other, of a <HI>Fever,</HI> except in Ca&s;e of <HI>Poi&s;on. The Prince dying, tho' he took it; the Queen, in the Agony of her Grief, &s;hewed</HI> Ralegh<HI>'s Letter, and laid &s;o much Weight on the Expre&s;&s;ion about Poi&s;on, that to her dying Day &s;he could never be di&s;&s;uaded from the Opinion, that her beloved Son had foul Play done him.</HI> If this was true, there might be a Stre&s;s too confidently laid on this Medicine, in &s;uppo&s;ing that nothing but Poi&s;on could rele&s;i&s;t the Power of it, and per|haps &s;ome Inadvertency in &s;tarting &s;uch a Su&s;picion in a fond Mother, which (in the &s;aid modern Writer's Opinion) there might po&s;&s;ibly be no Ground for, and might, in the Con&s;equence, prove fatal to <HI>Ralegh</HI> him&s;elf; tho' the &s;ame Author al&s;o knew, <HI>Ralegh</HI> was not the only Man who &s;tarted that Su&s;picion; for he knew what the Prince's do|me&s;tick Chaplain preach'd at St. <HI>James</HI>'s on the Di&s;&s;olution of his Highne&s;s's Family; and he knew
<PB N="379" REF="389">
what the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Coke</HI> not long after &s;aid in open Court about the poi&s;oning of Sir <HI>Tho|mas Overbury:</HI> That it was to prevent the Di&s;co|very of another Crime of the &s;ame Nature, com|mitted upon one of the highe&s;t Rank, whom he termed a <HI>Sweet Prince;</HI> and indeed &s;everal Hi&s;to|ries of the&s;e Times make no Secret of it, where they &s;hew the Bickerings between Prince <HI>Henry</HI> and the afore&s;aid Favourite <HI>Car,</HI> in Regard to the Counte&s;s of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> not to mention other Motives. However, the Phy&s;icians about the Prince gave it under their Hands, which was &s;pread abroad in &s;everal Copies, that he died of a &s;trong Malignant <HI>Fever,</HI> after they had anatomiz'd him to amu&s;e the World (&s;ays another Writer) and clear the Su&s;|picion of Poi&s;on, as if no Venoms could produce the like Effects; while the King, to di&s;pel the Clouds and Monitors of Sorrow, commanded that no Man &s;hould appear at Court in Mourning.</P>
<P>Whatever was the Cau&s;e of this excellent Prince's Death, <HI>Ralegh</HI> had no common Share in the Lo&s;s of him; his Highne&s;s having, but a few Months before he died, obtained <HI>Sherborne,</HI> with Intention to return it him, as is already ob&s;erv'd; and we are further inform'd, that King <HI>James,</HI> to &s;atisfy his Favourite <HI>Car,</HI> who was now Vi&s;count <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> gave him, in&s;tead thereof, 25000 <HI>l.</HI> in Money: So far was the Crown from gaining by this Pur|cha&s;e. But now, after the Prince's Death, this <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> got <HI>Sherborne</HI> of the King again; howe|ver (as &s;ome Kind of Compo&s;ition or Amends) his Maje&s;ty, we are told by <HI>Ralegh</HI> him&s;elf, al&s;o gave his Wife and Son 8000 <HI>l.</HI> for the &s;aid E&s;tate. But how it thrived with <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> is evident enough in the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times; where it appears, that in little more than three Years from this Prince's Death, the &s;aid Favourite, by the Title of
<PB N="380" REF="390">
Earl of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> was arraigned and condemned for that black and &s;hameful Bu&s;ine&s;s of poi&s;oning Sir <HI>Thomas Overbury;</HI> whereby he not only lo&s;t <HI>Sherborne,</HI> but all tho&s;e other Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which the King had &s;o lavi&s;hly heaped upon him; for what Merits or Services, may better appear in tho&s;e Hi|&s;tories, than it is needful they &s;hould do here. As to <HI>Sherborne,</HI> on whom it was next be&s;towed, and upon what Con&s;ideration, with the Attempts made after <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Death by his Son <HI>Carew</HI> to recover it; &s;ince the Accounts thereof would carry us too far beyond the Period in the&s;e Sheets propo&s;ed, and indeed do more properly relate to the Story of the Son, than the Father, I &s;hall here refer to an Ab|&s;tract thereof, in a brief Memorial of the &s;aid <HI>Ca|rew Ralegh,</HI> at the Bottom of the Page <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Carew Ralegh</HI> was born, as is before ob&s;erved, in the <HI>Tower,</HI> in the latter End of 1604 (or Beginning of the next Year) being aged about 13 Years at his Father's Death, as he tells us him&s;elf; became a Gentleman-commoner of <HI>Wadham</HI> College in <HI>Oxford</HI> in 1620, as <HI>Anthony Wood</HI> informs us; but indeed rather &s;ooner, becau&s;e <HI>Carew Ralegh</HI>'s own Words are, that, after having been five Years at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he came to Court, and, by the Fa|vour of <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> his noble Kin&s;man, hoped to obtain &s;ome Redre&s;s in his Misfortunes; but the King, not liking his Countenance, &s;aid, he appeared to him like his Father's Gho&s;t: Whereupon the Earl advi&s;ed him to travel, which he did till the Death of King <HI>James,</HI> which happen'd about a Year after. Then returning, and a Parliament &s;itting, he according to the Cu&s;tom of this Land, petition'd to be re&s;tor'd in Blood, that he might be enabled to inherit whatever Lands might fall to him, as his Father's Heir, or any other Way; but his Petition having been twice read in the Hou&s;e of Lords, King <HI>Charles</HI> &s;ent Sir <HI>James Fullerton</HI> (then of the Ped-chamber) for Mr. <HI>Ra|legh,</HI> who being brought into the King's Chamber by that Knight, his Maje&s;ty (after u&s;ing him with great Civility) told him plainly, that he had formerly promi&s;ed Sir <HI>John Digby,</HI> now Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to &s;ecure his Title to <HI>Sherborne</HI> (it being con|fer'd on him 14th of <HI>June)</HI> again&s;t the Heirs of Sir <HI>Walter Ra|legh;</HI> whereupon <HI>Digby</HI> had given him, being then Prince, <HI>ten thou&s;and Pounds;</HI> &s;o that now he was bound to make good his Promi&s;e, being King; and therefore, unle&s;s he would quit all his Right and Title to <HI>Sherborne,</HI> he neither could, nor would pa&s;s his Bill of Re&s;toration. Mr. <HI>Ralegh</HI> urged the Ju&s;tice of his Cau&s;e; that he de&s;ir'd only the Liberty of a Subject, and to be left to the Law, which was never deny'd any Freeman; but the King was po&s;itive, and &s;o left him. After this, Sir <HI>James Ful|lerton</HI> u&s;ed many Arguments to per&s;uade Submi&s;&s;ion, as the Im|po&s;&s;ibility of conte&s;ting with kingly Power, and the many Incon|veniencies of not being re&s;tor'd in Blood; all which con&s;ider'd, together with &s;plendid Promi&s;es of great Preferment in Court, and particular Favours from the King, not improbable, wrought much in the Mind of young Mr. <HI>Ralegh,</HI> who, being not full twenty Years old (as he &s;ays him&s;elf) left friendle&s;s and fortune|le&s;s, it prevailed &s;o far, that he &s;ubmitted to the King's Will.
Whereupon there was afterwards an Act pa&s;&s;ed 3 0 <HI>Caroli</HI> for his Re&s;toration; and, together with it, a Settlement of <HI>Sherborne</HI> to the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> and, in Shew of &s;ome Kind of Recom|pence, four hundred Pounds a Year Pen&s;ion, during Life, was granted to Mr. <HI>Ralegh</HI> after the Death of his Mother, who had that Sum paid during her Life, in Lieu of Jointure. About a Twelvemonth after this, Mr. <HI>Carew Ralegh</HI> married the Lady <HI>Philippa,</HI> Relict of Sir <HI>Anthony A&s;hley,</HI> a rich young Widow, by whom he had two Sons and three Daughters, and was not long after, at lea&s;t before the Year 1635, made one of the Gentlemen of the King's Privy-chamber. Among the ingenious Poems of <HI>Thomas Carew,</HI> E&s;q; (who was another of tho&s;e Gentlemen) printed 8vo. 1640, p. 80. there is a Compliment, <HI>To his Cou&s;in</HI> C. R. <HI>marrying the Lady</HI> A. by which Letters are to be under&s;tood this Mr. <HI>Ralegh,</HI> and that Lady <HI>A&s;hley.</HI> As for the kind Token, which <HI>Anthony Wood</HI> &s;ays the King honoured him with at his Ma|je&s;ty's leaving <HI>Hampton-court,</HI> and going into the <HI>I&s;le of Wight, anno</HI> 1647, it was no more than a Picture of the Lady <HI>Stanley,</HI> as I remember, which was Mr. <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s own Property; therefore she King, among the Letters he left on the Table, de&s;ired, in one of them, the &s;aid Picture might be returned him, as may ap|pear by tho&s;e Letters which were then printed, or the Extract of them in <HI>Heath</HI>'s Chronicle. In the Year 1650, and afterwards, &s;everal little Tracts of his Father's were publi&s;h'd and dedicated to him. In 1651, there was a Committee for the Sale of Delin|quents E&s;tates; and about that Time the Earl of <HI>Digby</HI> being fled to <HI>France,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ralegh</HI> had a fair Pro&s;pect to recover his E&s;tate, therefore deliver'd his Ca&s;e in to the &s;aid Committee; and it was order'd, 'That this Ca&s;e be reported to the Hou&s;e with the Opinion of this Committee; <HI>That they conceive him a &s;it Object of their Mercy.</HI> He al&s;o, about the &s;ame Time, drew up a brief Relation of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s Troubles, and addre&s;s'd it to the Parliament. But whether printed before his Death I know not, (the Edition here u&s;ed being dated three Years after) nor wherefore his Ca&s;e and Petition were laid a&s;ide. In 1656, came out the Ob&s;ervations on <HI>Sander&s;on</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of King <HI>James;</HI> which this Hi&s;torian &s;uppo&s;ing to be writ by <HI>Carew Ralegh,</HI> pub|li&s;h'd an An&s;wer to it the &s;ame Year, with &s;ome &s;candalous and unworthy Reflections therein upon him: But no one has given Heed to them. He certainly made his Court to the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> in Hopes of getting <HI>Sherborne</HI> by their Means.</P>
<P>Hence <HI>Wood</HI> &s;ays, he cringed to Men in Power, and was made Governor of the I&s;le of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> by the Favour of General <HI>Monk,</HI> in the latter End of <HI>January</HI> 1659, as <HI>Whitlock</HI> has re|corded. At the Re&s;toration of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. his Maje&s;ty would have confer'd &s;ome per&s;onal Honour upon him, but he declined it in Hopes of &s;omething better; the King therefore Knighted his elde&s;t Son <HI>Walter,</HI> who died &s;oon after at <HI>We&s;t Hor&s;els,</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> his Father's Seat, which had, I think, been the Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI>'s; for his Will is dated from thence, as a Friend who has &s;een it informs me. This was &s;old after Mr. <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Death to Sir <HI>Edward Nicholas,</HI> Secretary to King <HI>Charles.</HI> He had another Seat at <HI>Kenton Park</HI> near <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> which, I think, he &s;old him&s;elf; and dying in 1666, was bu|ried in the Month of <HI>December</HI> according to <HI>A. Wood,</HI> in his Fa|ther's Grave; who further &s;ays, he has &s;een &s;ome Sonnets of his Compo&s;ition, and certain ingenious Di&s;cour&s;es in MS. al&s;o a Poem &s;et to Mu&s;ick by Mr. <HI>Henry Lawes.</HI> Sir <HI>Henry Wotton,</HI> in his Letters, gives him the Character of a Gentleman of dex|terous Abilities, and he is by others mentioned with Honour; but far, God wot (&s;ays <HI>Wood)</HI> was he from his Father's Parts, either as to his Sword or Pen.</P></NOTE>; for as

to his elder Brother <HI>Walter,</HI> who&s;e Right it had fir&s;t been to have pur&s;ued whatever Pro&s;pect there
<PB N="382" REF="392">
was of retrieving the &s;aid E&s;tate, he died before their Father, as will be more particularly remem|bered towards the Conclu&s;ion of this Work.</P>
<P>But which of the&s;e two Sons was attended on in his Adventures by <HI>Ben John&s;on,</HI> is not ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h from the Words of an Author, who writes, <HI>That</HI> John&s;on's <HI>Mother, having married to her &s;econd Hu&s;band a Bricklayer, took her Son from</HI>
<PB N="383" REF="393">
We&s;tmin&s;ter-School <HI>(where he had made a hopeful Progre&s;s under the learned</HI> Camden) <HI>and made him work at her Hu&s;band's Trade: 'till being pitied by &s;ome generous Gentlemen,</HI> Camden <HI>got him a better Employment; which was to attend or accompany a Son of Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh <HI>in his Adventures; where|by gaining Experience, he made his Company accept|able among many.</HI> Now if this happened before <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> took to acting or writing of Plays, as our &s;aid Author relates it did, then Sir <HI>Walter Ra|legh</HI>'s elde&s;t Son was &s;carce old enough to go to School, much le&s;s upon Adventures. Be&s;ides, this Son never made, that we can hear of, more than one Adventure abroad, from which he never re|turned; therefore he could not part with his At|tendant or Companion <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> in the manner our &s;aid Author intimates he did after their Return. Then if we &s;uppo&s;e it the other Brother, <HI>Carew,</HI> he never made any Adventures at all, nor &s;tir'd out of <HI>England</HI> till &s;ix Years after his Father's Death, and then only upon a &s;hort Tour for about a Twelvemonth; which was near thirty Years after <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> became a Dramatick Poet or Writer for the Stage; and when he &s;eems rather to have wrote him&s;elf into his Pen&s;ion from the Crown, or otherwi&s;e into &s;uch ea&s;y Circum&s;tances, as render it unlikely he &s;hould attend even on <HI>Carew Ralegh</HI> in tho&s;e Sorrows and Difficulties he was then under; and con&s;equently in the whole, that either one or other &s;hould part with him <HI>not in cool Blood,</HI> as our &s;aid Author thinks, after their Return. Had the Time of his going abroad with the younger or the elder Brother been better adju&s;ted, that Particular of their Parting would need no Regard; &s;eeing by what Trifles, what Mi&s;under&s;tanding between them&s;elves, or Mi&s;repre&s;entations by others, &s;uch Divi&s;ions are made between Per&s;ons, who would,
<PB N="384" REF="394">
or might otherwi&s;e be mo&s;t &s;erviceable and bene|ficial to one another.</P>
<P>If <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> was of &s;uch a &s;urly and <HI>hypercriti|cal</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition, as &s;ome Men's Writings, and in|deed &s;ome of his own, have repre&s;ented him; as it makes &s;uch parting the more plau&s;ible, if there had ever been any &s;uch Meeting, &s;o it is probable it would have di&s;till'd with more Acrimony from his Pen, when he was giving a Character of <HI>Ralegh</HI> as an Author, than that he could find nothing to con|demn, either in his Judgment or his Stile.</P>
<P>But as for <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Temper, to all who had De|pendance upon him (and they were very numerous in the Time of his Felicity) e&s;pecially towards tho&s;e of any liberal Knowledge and Education, it appears to have been of &s;ingular Candor and Benignity. There are Examples, further than what have been beforementioned, of his Courte&s;y, &s;u|perior to that of many other great Per&s;ons in his Time, towards &s;uch Men of Parts as any ways re|lied on his Patronage or Protection; and publick|ly a&s;&s;erted by tho&s;e them&s;elves, who had ta&s;ted the Benefits thereof. He has al&s;o, under his own Hand, recommended &s;uch generous Treatment, as mo&s;t coercive, e&s;pecially to &s;uch as live under the Power or Command of others; and exploded the Au&s;tere, the Imperious Regimen, as what is liable to betray its Practitioners no le&s;s into Peril than Di&s;dain; where he &s;hews, how contemptibly the Vain, with effectual Sourne&s;s, counterfeit the Gra|vity of the Wi&s;e, becau&s;e the Shadow of Reve|rence, thereby obtained, has Power to delude the Eyes only of Underlings; and how thus, the Time wherein by u&s;ing it well, Men might attain to be &s;uch as they ought, they u&s;ually mi&s;pend. in &s;eek|ing to appear &s;uch as they are not: Yet withal,
<PB N="385" REF="395">
not only how deceivable, but dangerous a Cour&s;e this is; procuring, in&s;tead of the Re&s;pect that was hoped for, more Indignation than was feared. Many other weighty Coun&s;els and u&s;eful Pre|cautions to this purpo&s;e, are di&s;per&s;ed up and down his Writings, both in Print and Manu&s;cript, which (for brevity) I forbear here to recite.</P>
<P>But here, as <HI>Ralegh</HI> has been occa&s;ionally men|tioned in the Character of an Author, we are re|minded, that it is high time he &s;hould be con&s;i|dered more particularly in that Light; which can|not in any Place more properly be done, than in this &s;edentary part of his Life, when mo&s;t of his Works were written. Here then we are arrived at that part of his Story, wherein he will appear, rather a Collegian than a Captive; a Student in a Li|brary, than a Pri&s;oner in the <HI>Tower.</HI> On this Occa&s;ion, we cannot but reflect, how well &s;uch Productions, in &s;uch a Situation! Such &s;pacious Exerci&s;es of Genius, in &s;uch a contracted State! will prove, that, Tho' the Soul of Man, by a Fly, or a Hair, may be &s;eparated from the Body, Ty|ranny it&s;elf cannot confine it to the Body; and at the &s;ame Time, how trifling a calamity Confine|ment mu&s;t be, to tho&s;e who have well employed their Liberty. Some Men, impatient under &s;o many Years Re&s;traint, would have pined ob&s;cure|ly away by De&s;pair; and others with Rage, have made their Bonds more galling: But <HI>Ralegh,</HI> as in many other Di&s;a&s;ters, &s;o in this, has left us no common Example of an heroick Mind. In him we may ob&s;erve, there is no levelling a &s;ublime Spi|rit with the Subalterns of Nature: Pre&s;s it on one part, it will &s;till ri&s;e in another; and be like &s;ome hardy Plants we have &s;een, who&s;e Heads will &s;hoot forth and flouri&s;h in the Sight of Mankind, tho' their Roots are clo&s;ely fettered in Walls of Stone.
<PB N="386" REF="396">
Happy then are they, who in their Youth have &s;o fortified them&s;elves with Knowledge, and attained to &s;uch a Reli&s;h of Literature, that, where&s;oever they are driven by the Per&s;ecutions of Power, they can make the Contemplation of Wi&s;dom beguile the Sen&s;e of their Sufferings! Who out of the mo&s;t prevailing Examples in all Ages, of Patience and Prudence in all Exigences, can &s;et them&s;elves Le&s;|&s;ons of Fortitude, and Ta&s;ks of Imitations! Who can, out of the Misfortunes of others, extract Con|&s;olations for them&s;elves; or partake in their Pro&s;pe|rity, and make it Tributary to their own Con|tentment! Such carry with them an infallible, an undeprivable Solace; which can relieve them in Poverty with ine&s;timable Trea&s;ure, manumi&s;e them in Pri&s;on with intellectual Liberty: For the Multitudes of Anxieties which &s;urpri&s;e illiterate and uncultivated Minds, even in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t &s;plendid Affluence or Adulation, are inacce&s;|&s;ible to them, under the darke&s;t Clouds of Indi|gence or Reproach.</P>
<P>That <HI>Ralegh,</HI> in his greener Years, did attain to &s;uch a Ta&s;te of Letters as all his &s;ucceeding Avo|cations could never remove; and which proved not only an Ornament to tho&s;e his earlier and hap|pier Days, but a Relief in his Age and Afflictions, even &s;o as to render him under his darker Fortunes and Condition more illu&s;trious than he was in his brighte&s;t Pro&s;perity, may appear by a Survey of his Writings from the juvenile Productions of his Pen, to the more numerous and mature Offsprings of his pre&s;ent Confinement. But in this Survey, we think not the &s;imple chronological Method will be either needful or acceptable; which tho' ea&s;ie&s;t and readie&s;t for tran&s;cribing, would be mo&s;t crude and disjointed in reading; and yet be incapable of admitting all into their true Order, becau&s;e we
<PB N="387" REF="397">
have not the Time that &s;everal of his Pieces were written. Therefore, that we may carry on our Di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome Coherence, we &s;hall attempt at &s;uch a Dige&s;tion as, upon a little Review, will naturally ari&s;e, or mo&s;t conveniently, at lea&s;t in this Place, lead us, as out of a flow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">arden, in|to the high Road again of publick Action; for I might, perhaps, recommend &s;ome Variation, in this Arrangement, of the &s;ame Pieces, if they were to be revived in a uniform and methodical Edition of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s Works; &s;o that the junior Efforts of his Mu&s;e, or more extemporary Products of his epi&s;tolary Corre&s;pondence might not, as here for Di&s;patch, lead up the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Now as for the&s;e Productions of his Mu&s;e, &s;ince &s;everal of them are mentioned in the former part of the&s;e Sheets, they need be here only recapitulated; as his Poem on <HI>Ga&s;coign</HI>'s Steele-gla&s;s; <HI>The Excu&s;e; The Silent Lover, the An&s;wer to</HI> Marloe<HI>'s Pa&s;toral;</HI> with his Poem of <HI>Cynthia,</HI> and two more on <HI>Spen|cer</HI>'s <HI>Fairy Queen.</HI> Since the Time that the&s;e &s;even were before &s;poken of, I have met with four other &s;uch like poetical Pieces, which &s;eem al&s;o to have been compo&s;ed by the &s;ame Hand, from tho&s;e ele|gant Taulologies or Retornellos wherein his Son|nets and Madrigals are u&s;ually &s;o corre&s;pondent with one another. The&s;e were all written long be|fore this his Impri&s;onment, as were probably &s;ome al&s;o in the <HI>A&s;hmolean</HI> Library; namely, <HI>Erroris Re&s;pon&s;io,</HI> and his An&s;wer to the Lie, &amp;c. Be|&s;ides, we find there is a &s;atirical Elegy on the Death of the Trea&s;urer <HI>Cecyll,</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> written within this Period, likewi&s;e a&s;crib'd to him; and we have &s;till three Pieces more of his Poetry written afterwards, and but a &s;hort Time before his own Death. The&s;e are of a &s;olemn Nature; as his Pilgrim, his Epigram in Allu&s;ion
<PB N="388" REF="398">
to the Snuff of a Candle; La&s;tly, a Divine Stan|za, which is call'd his Epitaph.</P>
<P>Next we might &s;peak of tho&s;e &s;horter Pieces al&s;o in Pro&s;e, his Letters; and the&s;e, being written in all parts of his Life, cannot perhaps be improper|ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> this. I have &s;een of them in Print and Manu&s;cript to the Number of twenty|eight: Fourteen or fifteen of them have already been made u&s;e of in the foregoing Sheets; and the re&s;t, as they likewi&s;e are of per&s;onal Import, will be &s;erviceable in the Remainder, &s;o they need not be more particularly di&s;tingui&s;h'd in this Place.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e more continued Compo&s;itions which were the Re&s;ult of Experience and Occa&s;ion in his &s;everal publick Profe&s;&s;ions or Engagements of Life, will, perhaps, fir&s;t demand our Ob&s;ervation; &s;uch as relate to his Character as a Warrior, a Sailor, a Di&s;coverer of unknown Countries, and a Politician vers'd in the Intere&s;t of Nations and the Arts of Government. Among the&s;e, we may fir&s;t men|tion his military Di&s;cour&s;es; and the&s;e concern ei|ther a Defence of <HI>England</HI> in particular, or contain general Arguments and Examples of the Cau&s;es and Rea&s;ons of War among Mankind. On the former Subject, he &s;eems to have drawn up &s;everal Re|mon&s;trances which are but &s;paringly and &s;lowly come to Light. However, from what has before been ob&s;erved, of his having had a principal Hand in the Determinations of the grand Council of War, for putting the Nation in Arms when it was under immediate Apprehen&s;ions of the <HI>Spani&s;h Inva&s;ion,</HI> there is good Rea&s;on to believe he was al&s;o the Au|thor of a Treati&s;e, containing Notes of Direction for &s;uch Defence of the Kingdom: Written three Years before, when the &s;aid Enemies were begin|ning to &s;hew their De&s;igns. To this Treati&s;e was
<PB N="389" REF="399">
al&s;o joined a Direction for the be&s;t and mo&s;t orderly Retreat of an Army, whether in Campaign or Straits. And the&s;e were then pre&s;ented in MS. to the Privy-council. Herein, one Advice is, &s;ince Frontier Forces are&punc; unlikely to prevent an Enemy from landing, that if they &s;hould land, through the Deficiency or Ab&s;ence of our Shipping (for this is the Force <HI>Ralegh</HI> was ever for having fir&s;t us'd again&s;t &s;uch foreign Inva&s;ions) it were better by driving or clearing the Country of Provi&s;ions, and tempori&s;ing, to endeavour at growing &s;tronger, and rendering the Enemy weaker, than to hazard all by a confu&s;ed and di&s;orderly De&s;cent of the Po|pulace to oppo&s;e the fir&s;t landing, as their Cu&s;tom heretofore was. But this, chiefly, among the &s;aid Rea&s;ons and Po&s;itions, for preventing an invading Enemy, was a little before the Approach of the <HI>Spani&s;h Armada</HI> oppugned by <HI>Thomas Gibbes,</HI> E&s;q; Mu&s;ter-Ma&s;ter-General of her Maje&s;ty's Forces in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> in a Di&s;cour&s;e of the <HI>be&s;t Order for repul&s;ing a foreign Force,</HI> &amp;c. which he then exhibited in Print. This produced an An&s;wer, which, having been found in an old manu&s;cript Copy among others of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s Di&s;|cour&s;es, has lately been publi&s;hed; and which, by &s;everal Circum&s;tances therein, agreeing with many in his Life as well as with &s;everal Orders in the afore&s;aid Council of War, &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in his <HI>Hi&s;tory of the World,</HI> and his other Writings, offers may Rea&s;ons to believe it was written by him.</P>
<P>But if we would &s;ee his Opinion upon this Sub|ject in a more exten&s;ive and univer&s;al Manner, it mu&s;t be in his Di&s;cour&s;es of the original and funda|mental Cau&s;e of natural and nece&s;&s;ary, arbitrary and cu&s;tomary, holy and civil Wars; which tho' al&s;o publi&s;hed &s;everal Years after his Death, have &s;ufficient Marks of Genuinene&s;s upon them. There
<PB N="390" REF="400">
are other Writings of his be&s;ides, which relate to this Topick. But as War in them is treated of &s;ub|ordinately, and rather with re&s;pect to &s;ome na|tional Advantages, wherewith it might have been maintained again&s;t our Enemies as the Po&s;ture of Affairs then was, or the per&s;onal Behaviour of &s;ome particular Men, &s;o we may think it more proper to &s;peak of them under other Divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e, that which admits of his maritime Di&s;cour&s;es, may not perhaps be lea&s;t ob&s;ervable, being a Subject &s;o &s;carcely handled by Men of &s;uch Learning and Experience, yet of &s;uch Importance to a People in our Situation. And under this Head, that which &s;hould here be perhaps fir&s;t &s;poken of, tho' indeed one of the la&s;t Pieces he wrote in this State of Durance is, his Di&s;cour&s;e of the Invention of Shipping, &amp;c. wherein he treats of the U&s;e, De|fects, and Improvements thereof; the Strength and Deficiency of the Sea-forces of <HI>England, France, Spain</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> with five Cau&s;es of the Ri&s;e of the <HI>Hollanders:</HI> His Encouragement of a mutual Friend&s;hip between them and <HI>England,</HI> as al&s;o of the <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> Trade. This might lead us more particularly to his excellent Ob&s;ervations and Notes concerning the royal Navy and Sea Service, which he dedicated to the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> as is before-mentioned; therefore all we need ob&s;erve more of it in this Place is, that herein he di&s;cour&s;es under di&s;tinct Heads, of the Officers of the Navy, of &s;ome Errors to be reformed in Ship-building; and others, in harbouring and manning the Fleet; of &s;urcharging them with great Ordnance; the De|fects in &s;heathing and calking; the Abu&s;es in vic|tualling; Inconveniency of the Cook-rooms of mu&s;|tering and pre&s;&s;ing Mariners; of Arms and Mu|nition; and la&s;tly, of Captains to &s;erve in his Ma|je&s;ty's Ships. With the &s;econd Head or Chapter in
<PB N="391" REF="401">
this Tract, agrees his Letter to Prince <HI>Henry</HI> before &s;poken of, concerning the Model of a Ship. And in his Introduction to the &s;aid Ob&s;ervations, as was al&s;o &s;aid, our Author mentions a <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e of a ma|ritimal Voyage, with the Pa&s;&s;ages and Incidents therein,</HI> which he had formerly written to that Prince. This, if it is now in being, mu&s;t, I think, remain &s;till in Manu&s;cript; for no other Know|ledge of it have I el&s;ewhere met with; therefore it has, I fear, endured the &s;ame Fate with that other Work, probably, more copious and con&s;iderable, and to which, as what might &s;eem de&s;igned to bring the others into Practice, they may appear only preparatory. This Work, though taken Notice of by no other Author who has written of him, is thus mentioned by him&s;elf. <HI>Of the Art of War by Sea, I have written a Treati&s;e to the Lord</HI> Henry <HI>Prince of</HI> Wales. <HI>A Subject, to my Know|lege, never handled by any Man ancient or modern: But God has &s;pared me the Labour of fini&s;hing it, by the Lo&s;s of that brave Prince; of which, like an Eclip&s;e of the Sun, we &s;hall find the Effects hereaf|ter. Impo&s;&s;ible it is to equal Words and Sorrows: I will therefore leave him in the Hands of God that hath him:</HI> Curae leves loquuntur; ingentes &s;tupent. This may lead us up to &s;uch of his Di&s;cour&s;es as re|pre&s;ent this Art in Execution, particularly tho&s;e two gallant naval Actions wherein Sir <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> lo&s;t his Life, and him&s;elf won a mo&s;t &s;ignal Victory, of which his own Pen has pre&s;erved the faithful Memorials in his <HI>Report of the Truth of the Fight about the I&s;les of</HI> Azores, and his epi&s;tolary Account of the <HI>Action at</HI> Cadiz; both of them be|fore ab&s;tracted into this Work. Nor did his Care terminate in the be&s;t Advice for the Regulation and Maintenance of our Shipping, or in recording &s;ome of the mo&s;t notable Atchievements performed there|with,
<PB N="392" REF="402">
but extended to the Choice and Reparation of the mo&s;t convenient Harbours for their Recep|tion; and that not only by his Speeches in Parlia|ment, as we have already &s;een, but al&s;o by a Me|morial he pre&s;ented to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> touching the Port of <HI>Dover</HI> in particular; declaring how ho|nourable and profitable to her Maje&s;ty, how nece&s;|&s;ary and commodious for the Realm, the rebuilding it would be; with the lea&s;t expen&s;ive, and mo&s;t perfect manner of performing the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But if we advance to his more exten&s;ive pur&s;uits and performances relating to that Topick, they will lead us into a new Geography, into Di&s;coveries and De&s;criptions of unknown Countries, with the Voyages which him&s;elf and others under his charge and directions made to that Purpo&s;e. And under this Head would fall tho&s;e Papers and Di&s;cour&s;es of his, concerning the Di&s;covery, Plantation, and Settlement of <HI>Virginia,</HI> which were in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir <HI>Francis Wal&s;ingham,</HI> as was before ob&s;erved; but whether now recoverable I know not, nor what is become of his Treati&s;e of the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> which &s;eems to have been a very compre|hen&s;ive Work, by the &s;hort Sketch him&s;elf has given of its Contents before quoted.</P>
<P>Better Luck &s;eems to have befall'n his Writings upon <HI>Guiana;</HI> for we have at lea&s;t four of his Di&s;|cour&s;es on that Country in being, though they, probably, are not all he writ thereon; as fir&s;t, his <HI>Con&s;iderations on the Voyage for</HI> Guiana, which I never &s;aw in Print. Secondly, his <HI>Di&s;covery of the large, rich, and beautiful Empire of</HI> Guiana, which he printed him&s;elf, and being, before, largely u&s;ed and &s;poken of, the le&s;s need be &s;aid of it here. Third|ly, his <HI>Journal of his &s;econd Voyage to</HI> Guiana. This remains &s;till in Manu&s;cript, and perhaps &s;hould do &s;o; it being unfini&s;hed and full of Cha&s;ms,
<PB N="393" REF="403">
&s;eeming to contain only Notes and Ob&s;ervations for his own Memory, when he &s;hould have lei&s;ure at his return into <HI>England</HI> to dige&s;t and fill up the Particulars in a continued Di&s;cour&s;e: Accordingly it &s;eems to have &s;upply'd him therewith, when he wrote his <HI>Apology for the &s;aid Voyage.</HI> But as both the&s;e will be made u&s;e of in the &s;ub&s;equent part of our Narrative, 'twill be then time enough to &s;peak more di&s;tinctly of them. And there al&s;o will be mention'd the four or five Letters we have of his extant concerning the &s;aid la&s;t Expedition.</P>
<P>After his writings, becoming the Character of an able Commander both by Land and &s;ea, if we look for him as an Author in the Civil or Political Capacity, we may find him there al&s;o no le&s;s emi|nent; we may behold him in this light no le&s;s qualified to govern Nations, than in the other to conquer and defend them. Some of his Compo|&s;itions under this Di&s;tribution, are of a general Nature; as that call'd the <HI>Seat of Government,</HI> &s;hewing it to be upheld by the two great Pillars of Civil Ju&s;tice and Martial Policy; and how this is fram'd out of the Hu&s;bandmen, Merchants and Gentry of the Realm. The re&s;t of the&s;e Ranks or Degrees he calls the Fruit Trees of the King|dom; or tho&s;e who gather the Honey, yet hardly enjoy the Wax: And as the&s;e feed, &s;o the &s;econd Sort enrich it; nouri&s;hing &s;uch Trades as have a&s;&s;i&s;ted our Kings with great Sums of Money, and great Fleets, upon Occa&s;ion; while the third Sort, our Gentry, he calls the Garri&s;ons of good Order throughout the Realm; or means rather they have been, or &s;hould be &s;uch, more than they were in the&s;e latter Times, to agree with a Note he has el&s;ewhere dropt upon them. But this little E&s;&s;ay appears, by one Expre&s;&s;ion towards the Conclu&s;ion (mentioning &s;omething to be hereafter proved&punc;
<PB N="394" REF="404">
which is not) to be no more than a Fragment. The like we apprehend of his <HI>Ob&s;ervations concern|ing the Cau&s;es of the Magnificency and Opulency of Cities,</HI> from a Word in the very fir&s;t Paragraph, referring to &s;uch People as &s;eem to have been before mentioned. Tho' in the main this is a general Di&s;cour&s;e, it bears &s;ome particular References to a rude and barbarous People; and might po&s;&s;ibly be the Re&s;ult of &s;uch Con&s;iderations as mu&s;t have en|gaged his Mind, when tho&s;e Propo&s;itions were on foot for founding the City of <HI>Ralegh</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> as was before intimated. In this little E&s;&s;ay, after having &s;poken of the Means to civilize and reform &s;uch a People, he proceeds, under di&s;tinct Heads, to treat of the be&s;t Situations of Cities for Safety and Plenty; of the Multitude of Inhabitants, Re|ligion, Academies, Courts of Ju&s;tice, Artificers, Privileges and Triumphs; &s;o concludes with tho&s;e three Cau&s;es of confirming a City in her Great|ne&s;s, Ju&s;tice, Peace and Plenty. Of a more ex|ten&s;ive Nature &s;till is that Treati&s;e we have of his, called <HI>Maxims of State;</HI> being a methodical Com|pendium of Government in all or mo&s;t of its Forms and Branches; with many of its Chapters analytically dige&s;ted for the &s;ake of Brevity and Per&s;picuity. Herein having explain'd and defin'd the Words Government, Policy, State and the Of|fice of Soveraignty, he proceeds to di&s;tingui&s;h the feveral Sorts of Monarchy, Ari&s;tocracy, Free State, Tyranny, Oligarchy and Commonwealth. Then of the founding a State, with its Parts, and of pre&s;erving it under tho&s;e &s;everal Forms, by My&s;teries or Sophi&s;ms, Rules or Actions. La&s;tly, the Conver&s;ion of States, general and particular, by foreign Inva&s;ion, dome&s;tick Sedition, or Al|teration without Violence. Thus ends this Trea|ti&s;e; to which is joined, as a kind of Corollary
<PB N="395" REF="405">

But the King, wholly giving him|&s;elf up to Plea&s;ure, neither minded one, nor regarded the other.'</Q> That <HI>Gentleman</HI> was a Fi&s;herman, or other like Sea|faring Man, and I have &s;een his Treati&s;e; but publi&s;hed long before this, I think, was, which that Hi&s;torian a&s;cribes thus to Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh.</HI> The fir&s;t Edition of the&s;e Ob&s;ervations I could ever meet with in Print, is in 12<HI>mo.</HI> 1653, and it was bound up with the &s;econd Edition of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s <HI>Remains,</HI> 1656. Its anonymous Publi&s;her appears to be the Book&s;eller; who had no other Authority for appropriating it to Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> but the Opinion of a Per&s;on who recommended it to him as a ge|nuine Piece of his Writing. 'Tis true, our Author has touch'd, after a different Manner, upon the Topick, in &s;ome of his Tracts, and particularly at the End of his <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e of Shipping;</HI> where he laments, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That Strangers &s;hould be permitted to eat us out, by exporting and importing both our own Commodi|ties, and tho&s;e of foreign Nations.'</Q></P>
<P>But I think no Treati&s;e of his will be found that de&s;cends &s;o much into minute Examples, Calculations, &amp;c. However, not to except at this, becau&s;e a Treati&s;e upon Trade may require Ob&s;ervations &s;uitable to the Subject, it does not appear probable, that the Author of the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, who&s;e Project was, as he tells us, "To erect twenty Bu&s;&s;es in &s;ome Sea-ports Town, &s;o by Degrees to extend a thou&s;and or two over the Nation; who was one that had traced this Bu&s;ine&s;s, made his Endeavours known not only to the King, but his Noblemen, Merchants and others, who had made him Sub&s;criptions to di&s;bur&s;e large Sums of Mo|ney for building up this great and rich Sea-city;" &s;hould be a Pri&s;oner all this while in the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> No, this Pro|jector, further propo&s;ing to con&s;titute a State-merchant, for the&s;e Purpo&s;es; and praying, in the Conclu&s;ion, that the King would give him leave to nominate the Commi&s;&s;ioners for conferring up|on, and making Report thereof to his Maje&s;ty, &s;eems to have been &s;ome manufacturing or mercantile Man, one ambitious of that Office him&s;elf, and con&s;equently none of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh.</HI> But if from the Subject whereon, we bend our Con&s;ideration to the Time when this Tract was written, we &s;hall find further Objection again&s;t entitling our Author to it. For the very fir&s;t Words of the Dedication are, "According to my Duty, I am embolden'd to put your Maje&s;ty in Mind, that, about 14 or 15 Years pa&s;t, I pre&s;ented you a Book of &s;uch extraordinary Impor|tance for Honour and Profit of your Maje&s;ty and Po&s;terity, and doubting it has been laid a&s;ide, &amp;c. I am encouraged to pre&s;ent you with one more, &amp;c." Now if we allow the fir&s;t Book to have been pre&s;ented in the very fir&s;t Year of the King's being in <HI>England,</HI> then this &s;econd mu&s;t have been pre&s;ented in 1617 or 1618, when Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> was out of <HI>England,</HI> or his Thoughts far differently engag'd. But the greate&s;t Objec|tion of all is, that there are &s;everal Manu&s;cripts of this Treati&s;e in the Libraries of our Nobility and Gentry (more ancient than the earlie&s;t Edition in Print) which, as I have ob&s;erv'd, do all entitle it to one <HI>John Keymer,</HI> po&s;&s;ibly the Merchant or Vintner of that Name, whom <HI>Ralegh</HI> many Years before had licen&s;ed to retail Wine in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> as is related in the foregoing Part of this Life. With one of the&s;e Manu&s;cripts (the mo&s;t ancient I have &s;een) among the Collections of the late Mr. <HI>Granger,</HI> there was another, written al&s;o in the &s;ame little neat old Hand, a&s;cribed to the &s;ame <HI>Keymer,</HI> and which I take to be that fir&s;t mentioned in his Dedication la&s;t quoted; and al&s;o to agree in its Contents with <HI>John Keymer's Ob&s;ervations made upon the</HI> Dutch <HI>Fi&s;hery, about the Year</HI> 1601. <HI>Demon&s;trating there is more Wealth rai&s;ed out of</HI> Herrings <HI>and other</HI> Fi&s;h <HI>in his Maje&s;ty's Seas and the neighbouring Nations in one Year, than the King of</HI> Spain <HI>hath from the</HI> Indies <HI>in four: And that there were twenty thou&s;and Ships and other Ve&s;&s;els, and about four hundred thou&s;and People then &s;et on Work by Sea and Land, and maintained only by Fi&s;hing upon the Coa&s;ts of</HI> Eng|land, Scotland, <HI>and</HI> Ireland.

The&s;e we &s;hall divide but into two Parts, and then perhaps one of them may be be&s;t compre|hended under the Topic of Philo&s;ophy. This Way &s;eems to look, by its Subject, that &s;hort <HI>Trea|ti&s;e of the Soul</HI> a&s;crib'd to Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> whereof there is a Copy pre&s;erved among the <HI>A&s;h|molean</HI> Manu&s;cripts. It was never publi&s;h'd, I think, and I have not yet &s;een it; therefore can &s;ay no more, at pre&s;ent, of it. But we have in Print, another Treati&s;e which may be admitted under this Head, being built on the Doctrine of <HI>Pyrrho</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> Philo&s;opher, entitled, Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh's Sceptick or Speculations.</HI> This Doctrine, &s;hewing how much may be &s;aid <HI>for</HI> and <HI>again&s;t</HI> the &s;ame Things; &s;uch an ingenious Exemplification of it as this little Tract contains, may, if di&s;creetly u&s;ed, prevent many ra&s;h, dogmatical Determinations,
<PB N="401" REF="411">
and inure us to a wary or prudent Su&s;pence of Judgment: For the <HI>Sceptick,</HI> as our Author de|&s;cribes him, does neither affirm nor deny any Po|&s;ition, but doubts of it, and oppo&s;es Rea&s;ons again&s;t that which is affirm'd or deny'd, to ju&s;tify his not con&s;enting; becau&s;e he may report how Things appear, but whether they are &s;o he knows not. This little Tract, as it is here handled, relates chiefly to our Sen&s;es; but another we have, upon a more dignified Topic, as concerning our Manners, or Virtues and Vices; therefore what might be more particularly &s;ubdivided under the Di&s;tinction of Moral Philo&s;ophy; and it is call'd, <HI>In&s;tructions to his Son, and Po&s;terity.</HI> A Treati&s;e well be|coming an Author, who had &s;een the World in &s;o many Climates, and Life in &s;o many Changes. It is written in a per&s;picuous Style, with forcible Arguments, and on the mo&s;t practical Subjects. The&s;e are inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;everal memorable Ad|monitions, the Fruits of his particular Experience, therefore may claim a Part in his per&s;onal Hi&s;tory; and being apt to rivet in the Mind, may prove of con&s;tant U&s;e and Service; as touching upon the mo&s;t incidental Engagements in Life. Thus, in his fir&s;t Chapter upon the <HI>Choice of Friends,</HI> he &s;ays: <HI>Tho' I per&s;uade thee to a&s;&s;ociate with thy Bet|ters, or at lea&s;t with thy Peers; yet remember al|ways, that thou venture not thy E&s;tate with any of tho&s;e Great Ones who &s;hall attempt unlawful Things; for &s;uch Men labour for them&s;elves, and not for thee; thou &s;hall be &s;ure to impart with them in the Danger, but not in the Honour; and to venture a &s;ure E&s;tate at pre&s;ent, in hopes of a better in fu|ture, is mere Madne&s;s: Be&s;ides, great Men forget &s;uch as have done them &s;ervice when they have obtain|ed what they would, and will rather hate thee for &s;aying, thou ha&s;t been a means of their Advance|ment,</HI>
<PB N="402" REF="412">
<HI>than acknowledge it. I could give thee a thou&s;and Examples; I my&s;elf know it, and have ta&s;ted it in all the Cour&s;e of my Life.</HI> From his next Chapter, on the <HI>Choice of a Wife,</HI> we have before given Extracts in this Work. His third, again&s;t <HI>Flatterers,</HI> ends with this Reflection: <HI>Thou may'&s;t be &s;ure, that he, who in private will tell thee of thy Faults, is thy Friend; for he adven|tures thy mi&s;like, and hazards thy hatred: Few can endure it, every Man for the mo&s;t part delighting in Self-prai&s;e; one of the mo&s;t univer&s;al Follies which bewitches Mankind.</HI> From the fourth Chapter on <HI>private Quarrels</HI> we have already given a Ta&s;te; and here, the chief Caution he further urges to pre|vent the Inconveniences thereof, is ever to beware of unadvi&s;ed Speech. <HI>He that cannot refrain from much &s;peaking,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is like a City without Walls.</HI> And a little further, <HI>In all that ever I ob&s;erved in the cour&s;e of worldly Things, I ever found, that Mens Fortunes are oftner made by their Tongues than by their Virtues, and more Mens Fortunes o|verthrown thereby al&s;o, than by their Vices.</HI> In the fifth Chapter, among the Rules recommended to pre&s;erve an E&s;tate, the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing is again&s;t Sureti&s;hip; advi&s;ing rather to give a part of what a Man has, than live in continual Apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing both it and his Friend. <HI>If thou art bound, &s;ays he, for a Stranger, thou art a Fool; if for a Merchant, thou putte&s;t thy E&s;tate to learn to &s;wim; if for a Churchman, he has no Inheritance; if for a Lawyer, he will find an Eva&s;ion by a Sylla|ble or a Word to abu&s;e thee; if for a poor Man, thou mu&s;t pay it thy&s;elf, if for a rich one, he needs it not: Therefore from Sureti&s;hip as from a Man-&s;layer or Enchanter, ble&s;s thy&s;elf; for the be&s;t Profit and Re|turn will be this, that if thou force him for whom thou art bound, to pay it him&s;elf, he will become thy</HI>
<PB N="403" REF="413">
<HI>Enemy; if thou &s;halt chu&s;e to pay it thy&s;elf, thou wilt be a Beggar: and believe thy Father in this, and print it in thy Thoughts; that whatever Virtue thou ha&s;t, be it never &s;o manifold, if thou be poor withal, thou and thy Qualities &s;hall be de&s;pi&s;ed.</HI> In the &s;ixth Chapter, upon <HI>Servants,</HI> he has this Advice: <HI>If thou tru&s;t any Servant with thy Pur&s;e, be &s;ure thou take his Accompt e'er thou &s;leep; for if thou put it off, thou wilt then, afterwards, for Tediou&s;ne&s;s neglect it; I my&s;elf have thereby lo&s;t more than I am worth. Whatever thy Servant gains thereby, he will never thank thee, but laugh thy Simplicity to &s;corn; be&s;ides, 'tis the Way to make thy Servants Thieves, who el&s;e would be hone&s;t.</HI> The &s;eventh Chapter is only a Word or two again&s;t exceeding in the Bravery of gay <HI>Garments, as what will &s;oon wear out of Fa&s;hion, when Money in the Pur&s;e will always be in Fa&s;hion.</HI> The eighth is upon <HI>Riches</HI> (and as it &s;eems by the Beginning, &s;hould follow the Fifth) herein exhorting again&s;t the Attainment of them by ba&s;e or evil Means, he charges his Son, as, never to de&s;troy any Man for his Wealth, &s;o, by no Means further to impoveri&s;h the Poor; but above all Things, to exerci&s;e Compa&s;&s;ion towards them, as the be&s;t Way to Pro&s;perity and Peace of Mind. <HI>U&s;e, &s;ays he, thy poor Neighbours and Tenants well; pine not them and their Children, to add Superfluity and needle&s;s Expences to thy&s;elf. He that has Pity on another Man's Sorrow, &s;hall be free from it him&s;elf; he that delights in, and &s;corns the Mi&s;ery of another, &s;hall, one Time or other fall into it him&s;elf.</HI> The ninth is again&s;t the Inconveniencies of delighting in <HI>Wine,</HI> as being the greate&s;t Enemy to Health, Tru&s;t, Honour and Preferment; and the la&s;t Chapter be|gins thus: <HI>Now for the World, I know it too well, to per&s;uade thee to dive into the Practices thereof; rather &s;tand upon thy own Guard again&s;t all that</HI>
<PB N="404" REF="414">
<HI>tempt the thereunto, or may practi&s;e upon thee in thy Con&s;cience, thy Reputation, or thy Pur&s;e; re&s;olve that no Man is wi&s;e or &s;afe, but he that is hone&s;t.</HI> So concludes with advi&s;ing him to make God his Director in all his Actions.</P>
<P>With the&s;e In&s;tructions to his Son, which have, I think, been oftner printed than mo&s;t other of our Author's le&s;&s;er Pieces; there is u&s;ually joined, in all the Editions I have &s;een, <HI>The dutiful Advice of a loving Son to his aged Father.</HI> 'Tis a Religious and Rhetorical Exhortation to prepare for his latter End; written in a general Manner, but how probably by our Author, or by either of his Sons, it is left to the critical and di&s;cerning Reader. All the Works I have met with further a&s;cribed to Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> bearing any Affinity with this Cla&s;s, are two Manu&s;cripts, which might be di&s;|tingui&s;hed under the Branch of Natural Philo&s;o|phy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is his Treati&s;e <HI>Of Mines, and the Trial of Minerals;</HI> a Subject on which he very proba|bly might write, both from his own Ob&s;ervations in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and tho&s;e Engagements he might al&s;o have in his Native County of <HI>Devon,</HI> with his Brother Sir <HI>Adrian Gilbert,</HI> who fir&s;t, in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, begun to work the long neglected Mines in <HI>Comb-Martin</HI> (whence King <HI>Edward</HI> III. had &s;upply'd his Wars again&s;t <HI>France)</HI> and was followed by Sir <HI>Beavis Bulmer,</HI> who from tho&s;e Mines recovered a great Quantity of Silver, out of which, he cau&s;ed two ma&s;&s;y Goblets to be made; one whereof was pre&s;ented to the Earl of <HI>Bath;</HI> and the other, weighing one hundred thirty &s;even Ounces, to the Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> in the 35th of the Queen's Reign. So that what <HI>Ci|cero</HI> &s;ays to his Friend of this I&s;land, that it yield|ed not a Drachm of that Metal, was fal&s;e in
<PB N="405" REF="415">
<HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Time, and what he could not be &s;ure was true in his own. But whether the &s;aid Treati&s;e is &s;o particular as to mention any Thing of this I know not, having never &s;een it. The &s;econd Manu&s;cript is Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s <HI>Collection of Chymical and Medicinal Receipts</HI> for fixing <HI>Mercury,</HI> preparing <HI>Antimony,</HI> and for the Cure of &s;everal Di&s;ea&s;es. His Application to Studies of this Kind, may per|haps be &s;omewhat accountable from the Patronage, which, as in a Note before cited, it appears he had &s;hewn to <HI>John He&s;ter,</HI> the famous Chymi&s;t, with the Conver&s;ation there might probably pa&s;s between them, and the Knowledge he had learn'd from the <HI>Guianians</HI> of curing all manner of Poi|&s;ons, &amp;c. 'Tis apparent, that he be&s;towed &s;ome portion of his Time upon the U&s;e of Lembicks and Crucibles while he was in the <HI>Tower,</HI> and &s;eems to have had a kind of Laboratory there for his &s;aid Operations. A view of him in this light will ex|plain the Expre&s;&s;ion in a Character of him given by Dr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Hall,</HI> the venerable Bi&s;hop of <HI>Nor|wich</HI> (whom Sir <HI>H.

How elaborately &s;oever many of the&s;e Pieces are allowed by others to have been written, our Author looked upon them but as little Excur&s;ions, or Sal|lies, as he calls them, from his grand Labour, I mean that Ocean of Hi&s;tory, wherein he has out|done all that went before him, and given &s;uch Lights to Futurity as mu&s;t ever be grateful. A Voyage, which, <HI>If begun even in the Dawn of his Day, when the Light of Knowledge fir&s;t broke out upon his younger Years, and before any Wound received, either from Fortune or Time, he might yet well have doubted (as he ob&s;erves him&s;elf) that the Darkne&s;s of Age and Death would have overtaken him long before the Performance.</HI> But being undertaken, as it was, in the Evening of a tempe&s;tuous Life, a Life &s;o far run out in Travels and Con&s;iderations of &s;uch op|po&s;ite Nature; for one under the &s;oul-piercing Privations of Honour, Fortune, Freedom! One buried alive! to attempt &s;uch a univer&s;al Revival of the Dead! And, while his Body, under all tho&s;e pre&s;&s;ures, was &s;o long incarcerated, for his Brain to be delivered of that <HI>Minerva,</HI> as one calls it, his <HI>Hi&s;tory of the World!</HI> is an Example, that might puzzle &s;uch an Hi&s;torian even as <HI>Ralegh</HI> him&s;elf to parallel. For, beginning at the Crea|tion, he has given us the Flower of recorded Sto|ry down to the End of the &s;econd <HI>Macedonian</HI> War. Thus having reviewed the three fir&s;t Mo|narchies of the World, he leaves <HI>Rome</HI> in the fourth, Triumphant, about a Century and a half before the Birth of Chri&s;t, comprehending a period of near four thou&s;and Yeas. This Work was divided by our Author into five Books, who annexed to it a very copious and u&s;eful Chronological Table; and it was with the further Decorations of Maps, Tables of Genealogy, &amp;c. publi&s;h'd in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> ju&s;t before the Meeting of the Parliament, in a
<PB N="407" REF="417">
large Volume, <HI>Folio,</HI> 1614. The Approbation it has met with &s;ince the Author's Death has been &s;o univer&s;al, that if they are different Editions of the Book to which we may &s;ee different Dates printed, we may venture to &s;ay, no Work, of any Author in <HI>England,</HI> has been &s;o often reprinted that is of equal Size and Antiquity. The &s;everal Characters and Commendations which have been be&s;tow'd on this Hi&s;tory as well by mi&s;cellaneous Writers, who have frequently quoted it with great Deference and Re&s;pect, as by Hi&s;torians and Criticks, who have clo&s;ely traced and throughly examin'd it; and as well in Ver&s;e, as Pro&s;e; would be too nu|merous to be here in&s;erted, could they be reco|ver'd. To provide therefore as well again&s;t the Ignorance as the Satiety of tho&s;e Readers who have not met with them, a few are pre&s;ented in the An|notation here directed to. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This may not perhaps be better introduced than in the Re|flection of Bi&s;hop <HI>Hall,</HI> who in his ingenious Book of <HI>Con&s;ola|tions,</HI> has the&s;e Words, "A wi&s;e Man, as <HI>Laurentius</HI> the Pres|byter ob&s;erved well, does much in Solitude. So may'&s;t thou employ the Hours of thy clo&s;e Retiredne&s;s, and ble&s;s God for &s;o happy an Opportunity. How memorable an In&s;tance has our Age afforded us of an eminent Per&s;on to who&s;e Impri&s;onment we are all obliged, be&s;ides many philo&s;ophical Experiments, for that noble Hi&s;tory of the World now in our Hands? The Court had his youthful and freer Years, and the Tower his latter Age; the Tower reformed the Courtier in him, and produced tho&s;e worthy Monuments of Art and Indu&s;try, which we &s;hould have in vain expected from his Freedom and Jollity. It is ob&s;erved, that &s;hining Wood, when it is kept within Doors, lo&s;es its Light: it is otherwi&s;e with this, and many other active Wits, which had never &s;hin'd &s;o much, if not for Clo&s;ene&s;s." Thus in a Treati&s;e call'd, <HI>Balm of</HI> Gilead; <HI>or, Comforts for the Di|&s;tre&s;s'd, both moral and divine, by Dr.</HI> Jo&s;eph Hall, <HI>Bi&s;hop of</HI> Nor|wich, 12mo. 1652; afterwards reprinted under the Title of <HI>The Art of Patience,</HI> &amp;c. 8vo. 1684. In the <HI>Familiar Letters</HI> of <HI>James Howel,</HI> E&s;q; &s;peaking of this rare and renowned Knight, he &s;ays, "His Fame &s;hall contend in <HI>Longaevity</HI> with this I&s;land it&s;elf, yea with that great World which he Hi&s;tori&s;es &s;o gallant|ly." In another well-known Book of his, call'd <HI>Dodona</HI>'s <HI>Grove;</HI> or, <HI>The Vocal Fore&s;t,</HI> di&s;cour&s;ing of <HI>Ralegh,</HI> and de&s;cribing him to have been, "A Cavalier of a &s;pacious Under&s;tanding, and of no vulgar Reach in Policy, &s;cientifical, and full of ab&s;tru&s;e No|tions; he adds, "That tho' his Body was under Re&s;traint, and coffin'd up &s;o many Years, yet he never travers'd more Countries than then; for his Brain ran over all the World, as appears by that famous Monument he tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity, and hung up in the Temple of Fame, while he was as it were buried alive." But in the Life of the Lord <HI>Stafford,</HI> written by <HI>Anthony Stafford,</HI> E&s;q; 4to. 1640, this Author goes &s;o far as to &s;ay, That if Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;tory of the World</HI> had been written in the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue, we &s;hould not have &s;crupled or avoided the Pains of learning that Language, only to read it. If we con&s;ult what Character the Hi&s;torians give it, we may find many of them who never name it without &s;ome Epithet or Sentence in its Prai&s;e. Thus Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> in one Place calls it an <HI>excellent Hi&s;tory;</HI> in ano|ther, the <HI>fir&s;t or chief of Hi&s;tories.</HI> And thus in the Preface of Dr. <HI>William Howell</HI>'s <HI>Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory,</HI> who mu&s;t have had continual Occa&s;ions of in&s;pecting our Author's, 'tis &s;aid, That <HI>Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh <HI>is never to be mentioned without Honour. Shirley,</HI> in his Life of our Author, gives it as his Judgment of his Hi&s;tory, "That for the Exactne&s;s of its Chronology, Curiou&s;ne&s;s of its Contexture, and Learning of all Sorts, it &s;eems to be the Work of an Age." And a little further. "That a Man, who had been the greate&s;t Part of his Life taken up in Action, &s;hould write &s;o judiciou&s;ly, &s;o critically, of Times and Actions, is as great a Wonder as the Book it&s;elf; and it &s;till remains in Doubt, whether the Age he liv'd in was more oblig'd to his Pen or his Sword, the one being bu&s;y in conquering the new, the other in &s;o bravely de&s;cribing the old World." And Mr. <HI>Echard,</HI> in the Preface of his <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory, admires that Part of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Hi|&s;tory which treats of the <HI>Roman</HI> Story. "E&s;pecially the la&s;t Hundred Years, which, &s;ays he, are written with very much Spirit and Judgment, and all of it with as much Skill and Clear|ne&s;s: yet that all before the fir&s;t <HI>Panick</HI> War is not proportionably copious to the re&s;t.' But how duly it was con&s;idered by this par|ticular Hi&s;torian, whether that was not a judicious Di&s;propor|tion, in our general Hi&s;torian, may be left to the Examination of others.</P>
<P>To this we may join the Character of Dr. <HI>Henry Felton</HI> in his <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation upon the Cla&s;&s;icks,</HI> where he &s;ays, "Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;tory of the World</HI> is a Work of &s;o va&s;t a Compa&s;s, &s;uch endle&s;s Variety, that no Genius but one adventurous as his own, dur&s;t have undertaken that great De&s;ign. I do not apprehend any great Difficulty in collecting and common-placing an Uni|ver&s;al Hi&s;tory from the whole Body of Hi&s;torians; that is no|thing but mechanick Labour. But to dige&s;t the &s;everal Authors in his Mind; to take in all their Maje&s;ty, Strength and Beauty; to rai&s;e the Spirit of meaner Hi&s;torians, and to equal all the Ex|cellencies of the be&s;t; this is Sir <HI>Walter</HI>'s peculiar Prai&s;e. His Stile is the mo&s;t perfect, the happie&s;t, the mo&s;t beautiful of the Age he wrote in; maje&s;tick, clear and manly; and he appears every where &s;o &s;uperior rather than unequal to his Subject, that the Spirit of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> &s;eems to be breathed into his Work."</P></NOTE></P>

and Judgment, which many would have thought &s;ufficient for any Undertaking, he with that Caution, wherewith we have beheld &s;o many others of his great Enterprizes temper'd, would &s;uffer no Part of this Hi&s;tory to pa&s;s his own Hand, before &s;ome of the mo&s;t able Scholars, whom he a&s;&s;emhled, it &s;eems, for this Purpo&s;e, had debated the Parts he was mo&s;t doubtful of, and they mo&s;t conver&s;ant in, before him. Thus in the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> and <HI>Oriental</HI> Antiquities, or fainter and more remote Foot&s;teps of Time, he would &s;ometimes con&s;ult the learned Dr. <HI>Robert Burhill.</HI> In all Parts of Chronology, Geography, and other Branches of mathematical Science, he wanted not the Opinions of the learned <HI>Hariot,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI>'s three <HI>Magi,</HI> long his Neigh|bours in the Tower; and wherever he &s;crupled any Thing in the Phra&s;e or Diction, he would hear the acute and ingenious Sir <HI>John Ho&s;kyns,</HI> &s;ometime al&s;o Re&s;ident in the&s;e Confines; who viewed and reviewed the &s;aid Hi&s;tory, as we are told, before it went to the Pre&s;s, and whom <HI>Ben John&s;on,</HI>

proud of calling others his Sons, could gratify that Humour in calling Father. Thus having &s;pared no Labour, and neglected no Means to bring this Work to the Perfection wherein we behold it, 'tis no Wonder that &s;ome Scribbler or other &s;hould, upon finding it &s;o univer&s;ally read, endeavour to rai&s;e him&s;elf a little Profit or Credit from it, by pretending that the World needed an Abridgment of its Hi&s;tory, as if that wherewith Sir <HI>Walter Ra|legh</HI> has pre&s;ented us, either is, or was intended for any Thing more. But this more &s;pecious Kind of Detraction meeting with no Countenance, the Author of it threw out another, of Animadver&s;ions upon this Hi&s;tory; but as in&s;ignificant and no le&s;s di&s;regarded than the other, being agreeable to that unhappy Spirit of Contradiction which ever harra&s;s'd him to oppo&s;e the greate&s;t Writers in his Time.</P>
<P>But that which is more con&s;iderable concerning this Hi&s;tory is, whether our Author ever continued it down to his own Times; and whether, on &s;ome Pretence that this fir&s;t Part did not meet with En|couragement, he ever de&s;troyed the &s;aid Continu|ation him&s;elf, as we have it in the Mouths of every Body when they &s;peak of him, but in the Belief of no-body who knows any Thing of his Story or his Character. All that he &s;ays him&s;elf, in the lea&s;t glancing this Way, is fir&s;t in his Preface, <HI>That he propo&s;ed to confine his Di&s;cour&s;e with this our renown|ed I&s;le of</HI> Great-Britain. And <HI>That he forbears to promi&s;e a &s;econd or third Volume, which he intends if the fir&s;t receives Grace and good Acceptance, for that which is already done may be thought enough and too much.</HI> La&s;tly, in the Conclu&s;ion of the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>Whereas this Book by the Title calls it&s;elf</HI> The fir&s;t Part of the General Hi&s;tory of the World, <HI>implying a &s;econd and third Volume, which I al&s;o intended and have hewn out; be&s;ides many</HI>

<HI>Di&s;couragements per&s;uading my Silence, it has plea&s;ed God to take that glorious Prince out of the World to whom they were directed; who&s;e un&s;peakable and never-enough lamented Lo&s;s has taught me to &s;ay with</HI> Job, Ver&s;a e&s;t in luctum cithera mea, &amp; or|ganum meum in vocem flentium. From hence it &s;eems plain enough, that our Author had only &s;ome Plan, or perhaps a few rough Draughts of &s;ome &s;ucceeding Parts of the Hi&s;tory at this Time drawn up, and that he was di&s;couraged from making any further Progre&s;s in them. Allowing his Mind might change, and that there was Time enough to fini&s;h the remaining Volumes between this Year, and that of his Death, which is &s;carce|ly allowable; yet as we know how mo&s;t of that Time was employ'd by him, it will admit of no room for any &s;uch Performance. For in 1615, the Year which followed that wherein he publi&s;h'd his Hi&s;tory, two at lea&s;t of his mo&s;t elaborate Tracts beforemention'd were written. The &s;ame Year he was al&s;o bu&s;y in writing Letters, and making other Intere&s;t for his Relea&s;ement, which he obtain'd before it was quite expired. After this, it will no le&s;s appear, that he made him&s;elf too eminently the &s;ubject of modern Hi&s;tory, to be any further an Author of that which is ancient. There is, indeed, a little Intimation of the De&s;ign he had upon &s;ome ancient Part of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Story, pre&s;erved in a Letter of his own, written it &s;eems, tho' undated, before his great Work was publi&s;h'd, to that Acquaintance, who&s;e Library was mo&s;t likely to accommodate him with tho&s;e uncommon Books which he wanted for his Pur|po&s;e. This Letter is as follows. <HI>Sir</HI> Robert Cot|ton, <HI>If you have any of the&s;e old Books, or any Ma|nu&s;cripts wherein I may find any of our</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>An|tiquities; if you plea&s;e to lend them me for a little</HI>

<HI>while, I will &s;afely re&s;tore them, and think my&s;elf much beholden unto you: Or if you have any old</HI> French <HI>Hi&s;tory, wherein our Nation is mentioned; or any el&s;e, in what Language &s;oever.</HI> (So &s;ub|&s;cribes him&s;elf) <HI>Your poor Friend,</HI> W. Ralegh. But this does not &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ure us, whether the U&s;e of the&s;e Books was to continue his <HI>General Hi&s;tory,</HI> or furni&s;h him upon &s;ome more particular Subject, however, we may incline with the Wri|ter of Sir <HI>Robert Cotton</HI>'s Life to the former Opi|nion. And as for the Rea&s;ons of one ingenious Author, <HI>why Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh <HI>was the mo&s;t pro|per Per&s;on to write the Hi&s;tory of his own Time;</HI> and the Opinion of another, <HI>That his admirable Performance, already publi&s;hed, &s;ufficiently &s;hews, that if he had attempted the</HI> Hi&s;tory of his own Country, or his own Times, <HI>he would have ex|cell'd even</HI> Livy <HI>or</HI> Thucydides; <HI>and that the An|nals of Queen</HI> Elizabeth <HI>by his Pen, without dimi|ni&s;hing from the &s;erious and judicious</HI> Camden, <HI>had been the brighte&s;t Glory of her Reign; and would have tran&s;mitted his Hi&s;tory as the Standard of our Language, even to the pre&s;ent Age:</HI> The&s;e are &s;till no Affirmatives that he did fini&s;h &s;uch a &s;econd Part. So that his own Intimations in the fir&s;t Part, re&s;erv'd and inconclu&s;ive as they are, &s;eem to have been the only Foundation of that formal Story, <HI>How Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh, <HI>a few Days before his Death, &s;ent for</HI> Walter Burre, <HI>the Book&s;eller who had printed his fir&s;t Volume, and taking him by the Hand, a&s;ked him, How that Work of his had &s;old? who an&s;wer'd, So &s;lowly that it had undone him; hereupon</HI> Ralegh <HI>&s;tepping to his D &s;k, reach'd out the other Part of his Hi&s;tory, which he had brought down to the Times he liv'd in, then &s;aying, with a Sigh, Ah Friend! has the fir&s;t Part undone thee? the &s;econd Volume &s;hall undo no more; this ungrateful</HI>

<HI>World is unworthy of it; &s;o &s;tept to the Fire, threw it in, and &s;et his Foot on it till it was con&s;um'd.</HI> But, as we ob&s;erved before, <HI>Ralegh</HI> had no Lei&s;ure to fini&s;h &s;uch a Second Part of his Hi&s;tory down to his own Time. In the next Place, 'tis no ways probable that he, who, in Regard to the fir&s;t Part, could follow the Rule of <HI>Seneca;</HI> that he, who <HI>having &s;atisfied his own Con&s;cience, could di&s;regard the Cen&s;ure of others,</HI> &s;hould &s;acrifice &s;o great a Part of his Labours, or any Part, in &s;uch a ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate Manner, to the &s;udden Repre&s;enta|tions of a Book&s;eller, without ever &s;u&s;pecting any mercenary Ends in him. Further, it does not ap|pear true that the fir&s;t Part did &s;ell &s;lowly, for there was a &s;econd Edition of it &s;et forth by that very Book&s;eller, within three Years after the fir&s;t; and la&s;tly, the fir&s;t Man we can meet with who reports the &s;ame, is a trifling and &s;uperficial Writer, who produces no Authority for his A&s;&s;er|tion.</P>
<P>As to the unfini&s;h'd Parts he might have of &s;uch a Continuation, to admit that they were thus de&s;troy'd would, moreover, in no wi&s;e agree with an Account we have more &s;atisfactorily atte&s;ted of that great Quantity there was in Being of Sir <HI>Wal|ter Ralegh</HI>'s unprinted Writings, &s;everal Years after his Death. For it is affirm'd to us, <HI>That the famous Mr.</HI> Hamden, <HI>a little before the Civil Wars, was at the Charge of tran&s;cribing</HI> 3452 <HI>Sheets of Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh<HI>'s Manu&s;cripts, as the Amanuen&s;is him&s;elf told me (&s;ays my Author) who had his clo&s;e Chamber, his Fire and Candle, with an Attendant to deliver him the Originals, and take his Copies as fa&s;t as he could write them.</HI> Yet what is become of this Trea&s;ure now, I have not been able to learn; for, if we &s;uppo&s;e that Mr. <HI>Hamden</HI> would not be at the Trouble and Charge of tran&s;cribing any of

our Author's Writings which had then been printed; and grant that all of his which have been printed &s;ince that Time, as well as all we can hear of remaining in MS. which are allow'd to be his, were Part of that Collection or Quantity, they will not, both join'd together, as might be com|puted from what is here ob&s;erved of them, amount to a fourth Part thereof, tho' we &s;hould admit two or three Pieces more, al&s;o a&s;cribed to him, which have not yet been named, and happen to fall under his hi&s;torical Divi&s;ion. The Fir&s;t of them is call'd, <HI>A notable and memorable Story of the cruel War between the</HI> Carthaginians <HI>and their own Mercena|ries: Gather'd out of</HI> Polybius <HI>and other Authors, by that famous Hi&s;torian Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh. The other two Pieces might &s;eem to fall within the in|tended Continuation of his Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory; but the fir&s;t of them, call'd <HI>The Life and Death of</HI> Mahomet; <HI>the Conque&s;t of</HI> Spain; <HI>together with the Ri&s;ing and Ruin of the</HI> Saracen <HI>Empire,</HI> a&s;cribed to Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> near twenty Years after his Death, by the Book&s;eller who dedicated it to his Son, is, except a few Leaves about that of <HI>Maho|met,</HI> no more than a Tran&s;lation of an Epitomy made by &s;ome ignorant <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Author, chiefly from what one of his own fabulous Countrymen had written of a fictitious Prince named <HI>Jacob Al|man&s;or,</HI> as I have been a&s;&s;ur'd by a Gentleman of great Knowledge both in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Oriental</HI> Writers. But the Stile it&s;elf, &s;o uncouth in &s;ome Places, &s;o meagre in others, and incorrect, e&s;pe|cially in known Things, Places, and Per&s;ons, might of it&s;elf exclude our Author from having any hand it.

four&s;core Years after his Death before this was pub|li&s;h'd. Yet there are &s;everal old manu&s;cript Co|pies of it in the Libraries of the Curious, which entitle him the Author of it; but it was written at lea&s;t two Years before he publi&s;h'd his <HI>Hi&s;tory of the World,</HI> becau&s;e it was in&s;cribed to a Per&s;on who died &s;o long before the &s;aid Publication, in the&s;e Words: <HI>I intend by the Help of God and your Furtherance, right noble Earl of</HI> Sali&s;bury, <HI>to write a brief Hi&s;tory of</HI> England <HI>from</HI> William <HI>the Fir&s;t, entitled the Conqueror, to the End of Queen</HI> Elizabeth <HI>of perpetual Memory.</HI> But by then his <HI>Hi&s;tory of the World</HI> was fini&s;h'd, he was, as we have ob&s;erved, al&s;o from his own Words, di&s;|couraged from all Continuation. To the&s;e Di&s;|couragements might be added, the ungrateful Treatment which was &s;hewn to this Part he did publi&s;h, at its fir&s;t Appearance: For tho' we have ob&s;erved what univer&s;al Approbation it has met with &s;ince the Author's Death; yet how it was re|receiv'd as &s;oon as it came abroad and made its fir&s;t Vi&s;its at Court, we are yet to relate.</P>

One of the&s;e Merchants, afterwards knighted, and very eminent for his Dealings, was named <HI>Peter Vanlore,</HI> who &s;o ap|proved of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s Undertaking, that he not only &s;ent a Letter to his Brother Sir <HI>Adrian Thibaut</HI> in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> reque&s;ting him to engage another Merchant there to communicate &s;omething he knew of the Riches in <HI>Guiana</HI> to Sir <HI>Walter Ra|legh;</HI> but made that Reque&s;t in <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s own Man|ner of Expre&s;&s;ion, from a Copy which he drew up for him. This Draught, as I have it from the &s;aid Original, is as follows: Brother <HI>Tibotes, There is a Merchant in</HI> Am&s;terdam, <HI>that for the Love he bears to my honourable Friend Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh, <HI>is con|tent to di&s;cover &s;omewhat of Importance unto him in</HI> Guiana, <HI>to which Country Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh <HI>is now preparing to go; but he doth require A&s;&s;arance from Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh, <HI>that he him&s;elf may be a&s;&s;ured to enjoy &s;uch Part of the Commodity di&s;cover'd, as he &s;hall agree upon with Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh <HI>by his De|puty Mr.</HI> Henry Hovenar. <HI>I do therefore pray you to &s;peak with the Party which Mr.</HI> Hovenar <HI>will bring unto you, and to know what A&s;&s;urances he will require, which to plea&s;ure Sir</HI> Walter <HI>I &s;hall be willing to give; that is to &s;ay, to give him A&s;&s;urance that upon Sir</HI> Walter<HI>'s Return into</HI> England, <HI>the Charges being deducted, the Di&s;coverer &s;hall receive from Sir</HI> Walter <HI>&s;uch Part of the &s;aid Merchandize as Sir</HI> Walter <HI>and he &s;hall agree on; altho' there needs no &s;uch A&s;&s;ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e to be given, becau&s;e his Ma|je&s;ty doth a&s;&s;ure all Sir</HI> Walter<HI>'s Partners by the Great Seal of</HI> England, That they &s;hall truly and quietly enjoy all their Parts and Shares of what Goods, Merchandize, or Trea&s;ure &s;oever, &s;hall be returned; <HI>out of which Great Seal of</HI> England, <HI>the Di&s;|coverer &s;hall have an A&s;&s;ignment for &s;o much as belongs</HI>

And if <HI>Ralegh</HI> had his Commi&s;&s;ion for that Voyage before this Time, as it appears he had, by his citing it, then it mu&s;t be erroneou&s;ly dated, being near two Months after, in King <HI>James</HI>'s Declaration. Here again, that Commi&s;|&s;ion &s;eems to have been given under the Great Seal of <HI>England;</HI> and al&s;o el&s;ewhere: In that De|claration, 'tis &s;aid to be under the Privy Seal.

<P>In the mean while we may here ob&s;erve a little Oppo&s;ition that was made to this Voyage. And in|deed &s;ome Per&s;ons at Court, who might remember what Advances <HI>Ralegh</HI> had formerly made there, by the Means of &s;everal Exploits which he under|took at a Di&s;tance from it; and others, admoni&s;h'd by Con&s;cience, that every friendly Gale in his Na|vigation would be &s;plitting them upon a Rock, might well be expected to ob&s;truct, as far as they could, his Progre&s;s: But none do we hear of &s;o impatient and clamorous again&s;t it as the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> For there had been now in <HI>England,</HI> about three Years, an Agent from <HI>Spain,</HI> named <HI>Diego Sarmi|ento de Acuna,</HI> better known, but not till about the Time of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Death, or perhaps after it, by the Title of Count <HI>de Gondomar;</HI> a Man, who, if he gain'd that Influence he did over King <HI>James</HI> pure|ly by Art, mu&s;t be allowed a good Share of Dex|terity in the My&s;teries of Negotiation; but as he

was adapted by Nature to &s;ooth and captivate him, no le&s;s than by the Preten&s;ions of his Agency, it dimini&s;hes the Wonders of his Succe&s;s in making that King &s;uch a Subject to his Enchantments, and keeping him &s;o many Years a <HI>Pri&s;oner</HI> as it were in the <HI>Tower</HI> he had heap'd up of airy and glittering Promi&s;es: Yet what Reward was re&s;erved, for all his Services here, in his own Country, and how this ardent Slave to the Will and Plea&s;ure of his Ma&s;ter, was both Executioner of his Royal Pride as well as other Pa&s;&s;ions, and Sacrifice al&s;o at la&s;t to them, mu&s;t be left for tho&s;e to di&s;play who have more Lei&s;ure to dilate upon &s;uch Retalia|tions of Providence. This was the Man who (as he is repre&s;ented in King <HI>James</HI>'s Declaration) now <HI>took great Alarm, and is &s;aid to have made loud and vehement A&s;&s;ertions to his Maje&s;ty in repeated Audi|ences, that he knew, and had di&s;cover'd the Intention and Enterprize of Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh <HI>to be but ho|&s;tile and piratical, tending to the Breach between the two Crowns, and the Danger and De&s;truction of the King his Ma&s;ter's Subjects in tho&s;e Parts; prote&s;t|ing in a &s;ort again&s;t it.</HI> To which that the King &s;hould an&s;wer, (as it is there &s;aid after <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Death) <HI>He would &s;end Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh <HI>with a limited Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> (but how limited it was will &s;oon appear) and that <HI>he dur&s;t not upon Peril of his Head, do any &s;uch Matter: and if he did, he would &s;urely do Ju&s;tice upon him, or &s;end him bound Hand and Foot into</HI> Spain, <HI>with all the Gold and Goods he &s;hould obtain by Robbery, and bring Home, were they never &s;o great.</HI> Then the King by Sir <HI>Ralph Winwood,</HI> got both a &s;olemn Prote&s;tation from <HI>Ralegh,</HI> that he had no other Intention but only to go to tho&s;e Gold Mines; and al&s;o a clo&s;e Letter to his Maje&s;ty (as it is here in his Declaration ju&s;tly call'd) confirming the &s;ame.

<P>This Ab&s;tract is made from the &s;aid Commi&s;|&s;ion, as it is printed in King <HI>James</HI>'s Declaration, and may agree with that which &s;eems al&s;o to have been given us from the Records. Whether there was, originally, any Preamble to it we cannot &s;ay. But there are Authors who affirm, that in this Com|mi&s;&s;ion King <HI>James</HI> called him his Tru&s;ty and Well beloved Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh.</HI> Tho' the&s;e may be Words of Cour&s;e in &s;uch like In&s;truments, yet if &s;ome Words were thus taken out in that Recital afore&s;aid, it might give Rea&s;on of inferring that by the &s;ame Liberty others have been &s;queez'd in. Yet even as it is &s;uffer'd there to appear, 'tis &s;urely far from being &s;o clearly penn'd in point of tho&s;e Limitations it is &s;aid in his Maje&s;ty's Declaration he promis'd the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador: For here is no Limitation to any Part of <HI>America,</HI> not only the <HI>South</HI> Parts but el&s;ewhere being authoriz'd, and all that are habitable, inhabited in &s;ome Degree or other by Heathen and Savage People: So vague, &s;o equivocal, and di&s;putable is that Di&s;tinction: Not one Word of <HI>Guiana,</HI> no owning of his own Right, or the Power he had lately given to plant there, no Privilege for working any Mine there, nor Prohibition to meddle with the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s

Subjects there or elfewhere, as another Writer has well ob&s;erv'd. On the contrary, full Liberty to carry what Arms and Ammunition they pleas'd for Defence, if they &s;hould need it; and la&s;tly, the Royal A&s;&s;urance of enjoying unmole&s;ted whatever they returned with. In &s;hort, this Commi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t ea&s;ily be ob&s;erved to have been penn'd, how clearly &s;oever pretended, as if King <HI>James</HI> did neither know of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s Intention for and at <HI>Guiana;</HI> tho' a little before, he had the whole Particulars thereof from <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s own Hand, or that there were any <HI>Spaniards</HI> planted there; tho' he appears to have known that al&s;o from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador him&s;elf, who&s;e own Kin&s;man, as we &s;hall hear, was &s;ent, during <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Re|&s;traint, from <HI>Spain,</HI> to build and colonize upon that very Spot to which <HI>Ralegh</HI> had now this unli|mited Commi&s;&s;ion, as we may rather term it, to go. For 'tis &s;o much the Rever&s;e of that clo&s;e penn'd Letter wherein <HI>Ralegh</HI> had, &s;o expre&s;&s;ively, and &s;o unre&s;ervedly, placed his whole Tru&s;t of this Voyage in King <HI>James,</HI> that it &s;eems con|triv'd, both to hoodwink the <HI>Spaniard</HI> till the Action was over, tho' the King betray'd it him&s;elf, and to &s;ecure Loop-holes &s;ufficient for the Royal Authority again&s;t his Exceptions; but they proved &s;o large, that it was thought expedient, in the End, as we &s;hall find, that the Commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould not be in&s;i&s;ted on to limit or re&s;train any body.</P>
<P>Whether this indi&s;tinct Power in that Commi&s;|&s;ion made <HI>Ralegh</HI> more or le&s;s importunate for his Pardon, we cannot &s;ay. Some indeed write, that he laboured mainly to obtain it; but they are led into that Belief by the Declaration afore&s;aid: Whereas we find it expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erted in a Letter of <HI>Carew Ralegh</HI>'s; that his Father had Overtures made him of procuring his Pardon for 1500 <HI>l.</HI> by

<PB N="443" REF="453">
agreed, that if he would &s;end up an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factor, who&s;e Ship then rode in the Road, what|ever the I&s;land afforded &s;hould be deliver'd at a rea&s;onable Rate. <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;ent the Factor, but the Governor procra&s;tinated, and at la&s;t &s;ent Word, that unle&s;s he would embark his Men which lay on the Sea Shore, the I&s;landers were &s;o jealous they dur&s;t not divide from one another to &s;upply him. <HI>Ralegh</HI> comply'd, but when half his Men were got aboard, the I&s;landers began to offer Violence upon the re&s;t. They &s;lew one, and &s;ent the Factor to tell <HI>Ralegh,</HI> they would part with nothing to him, for that they believed his Company to be the <HI>Turk|i&s;h</HI> Fleet which had lately de&s;troy'd <HI>Puerto Sancto.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hereupon would have gone and helped them&s;elves, but <HI>Ralegh</HI> con&s;idering what Di&s;plea|&s;ure it might give at home, how the Merchants might &s;uffer, and the poor <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factor be ruin'd, complained to the Governor of the <HI>Grand Canaries;</HI> of whom he al&s;o de&s;ired Leave to take Water undi&s;turb'd; but in&s;tead of An&s;wer, when he landed &s;ome hundred Men in the De&s;art Part of the I&s;land where they found fre&s;h Water, there Ambu&s;h was laid, by which one of his Men was wounded to Death, and more had been &s;lain, had not Captain <HI>Thornhu&s;t</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Hayman,</HI> two valiant Gentlemen, &s;econded by Sir <HI>Warham Sentleger</HI> and young Captain <HI>Ralegh,</HI> with half a dozen more, made forty of them run away.

<P>In Want of Water they &s;ail'd to <HI>Gomera,</HI> one of the &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t defended of all the&s;e I&s;lands, and the be&s;t Port.

But as
<PB N="444" REF="454">
&s;oon as <HI>Ralegh</HI> recover'd the Harbour, and com|manded there &s;hould be no more firing, he &s;ent a <HI>Spaniard</HI> he had with him a&s;hore, to a&s;&s;ure the Governor he had no Intention to make War with any of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> King's Subjects; and if any Harm had been done by his great Ordnance to the Town it was their Fault, who, by &s;hooting fir&s;t, gave the Occa&s;ion. The Governor an&s;wer'd, he thought they had been the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet afore&s;aid; but having been certified they were Chri&s;tians and <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and &s;ought nothing but Water, he was willing to let them take what they pleas'd, if he might be a&s;&s;ur'd they would make no Attempt upon the Town Hou&s;es, or their Gardens and Fruits. <HI>Ralegh</HI> reply'd, that he would give him his Faith, and the Word of the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> his Sovereign, that if the People of the Town or I&s;land &s;hould lo&s;e &s;o much as an Orange or a Grape by any of his Men without paying for it, he would hang him up in the Market-place. And <HI>Ralegh</HI> kept his Men in &s;uch good Di&s;cipline, that the Governor in divers Letters (for he wrote to him every Day) acknowledg'd how punctually <HI>Ralegh</HI> kept his Faith with him, in Regard to the inoffen&s;ive Behaviour of his Company; and al&s;o how much him&s;elf was beholden to him for his particular Civilities.

The Earl moreover gave him, at his Departure, on the 21&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> a Letter to <HI>Don Diego Sarmiento</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>England,</HI> te&s;ti|fying how honourably <HI>Ralegh</HI> had comported him|&s;elf to the <HI>Mori&s;co's</HI> in the&s;e <HI>Canary I&s;lands</HI> dur|ing the fourteeen Days that he was among them. Before he &s;et Sail, he di&s;charg'd a Bark of the <HI>Grand Canaries,</HI> taken by one of his Pinnaces, coming from <HI>Cape Blanc</HI> in <HI>Africa;</HI> who com|plaining that his Men had eaten of their Fi&s;h to the Value of &s;ix Ducats, <HI>Ralegh</HI> gave them eight.</P>
<P>After having weather'd through a violent Hurri|cane and &s;ome va&s;t Showers of Rain, be&s;ides Dan|gers no le&s;s fearful within; Sickne&s;s now begin|ning to vi&s;it his Ship, he arriv'd on the 2d of <HI>October</HI> at the I&s;le of <HI>Bravo:</HI> And here underwent great Hazards and Hard&s;hips; be&s;ide the Sick|ne&s;s daily &s;preading among his Men. For whereas all tho&s;e who navigated even between <HI>Cape de Vert</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> were wont to pa&s;s between fifteen and twenty Days at mo&s;t, he found the Wind &s;o con|trary to him, and indeed to Nature, &s;o many Storms and Showers, that he &s;pent near &s;ix Weeks in the Pa&s;&s;age from hence; by rea&s;on whereof, and the burning Heat of the Climate, he was in great Di&s;tre&s;s for Water. Here lo&s;ing Anchors, Cables and Water-ca&s;k, be&s;ides two more of his Company, he was driven after two Days, by a Kind of <HI>Turnado,</HI> from this I&s;land; which, as well as the others he touch'd at, before mention'd, he has well de&s;crib'd in his Journal of this unfortunate Voyage. After his Return home, Detraction did not &s;pare to give out, that he went to <HI>Cape de Vert</HI> knowing it to be infected, and thereby loft many of his Men; whereas he was 160 Leagues from that <HI>Cape,</HI> according to his own Account, in his Apology; and had three&s;core Men ill in his own
<PB N="446" REF="456">
Ship before he came to <HI>Bravo,</HI> as we find it in his Journal; tho' if he had gone to that <HI>Cape</HI> now, after the Rains which had fallen, there had been little Danger of any &s;uch Infection. All Places that lie near great Rivers, in low and moori&s;h Grounds, do indeed, as he rightly ob&s;erves, &s;ub|ject their Inhabitants to Fevers and Agues; as even along both Sides of our own River <HI>Thames;</HI> and other Infection is not found either in the <HI>Indies</HI> or in <HI>Africa,</HI> except when the ea&s;terly Wind or Breezes are excluded and kept off by &s;ome high Mountains from the Valleys, whereby the Air wanting Motion, &s;tagnates, and becomes exceed|ingly unhealthful, as at <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> and &s;ome other Places. But, &s;ays he, <HI>as good Succe&s;s admits of no Examination, &s;o the contrary allows of no Ex|cu&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Hence they proceeded, on the 4th of <HI>October,</HI> to|wards <HI>Guiana.</HI> But the Sickne&s;s revi&s;ited and de|&s;troy'd many of tho&s;e whom the Storms &s;pared, carrying off Numbers of his able&s;t Men both for Sea and Land, no le&s;s than forty-two of his own Ship ending their Voyage with their Lives, mo&s;tly in this Month, at lea&s;t before they reach'd the Coa&s;t. About the 12th of the &s;ame Month, when their Sickne&s;s began to be at the Height, and they at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance from any Shore, they were many other Ways al&s;o di&s;tre&s;s'd; for when they began to be in Scarcity of Water, they were al&s;o becalm'd; yet ever threatned with Extremity of tempe&s;tuous Weather, from the &s;trange and unu|&s;ual Alterations in the Atmo&s;phere. One while the Horizon muffled as it were in &s;uch thick and fear|ful Darkne&s;s, that they were forced to &s;teer a Day or two by Candle-light. At other Times, arched and over&s;hot with gloomy Di&s;colorations; &s;o that watery Rainbows were continually invading their
<PB N="447" REF="457">
Eyes, or heavy Showers their Bodies, and dead Calms retarding their Ships. Afterwards at <HI>Trini|dad, Ralegh</HI> ob&s;erv'd, be&s;ides two Water-galls, no le&s;s than fifteen Rainbows in one Day, and one of them bent as it were both Ends together, making a perfect Circle; and the&s;e were ever followed with wet Weather; for as he al&s;o noted, e&s;pecially of the Morning Rainbow, it did not here produce a fair Day, as in <HI>England.</HI> But one good Effect en|&s;u'd, that when their Water was &s;o &s;carce, near the latter End of this Month, that the Ship's Crew was reduced to half Allowance, they &s;aved &s;ome Hogheads, which fell from the Clouds, and all quenched their Thir&s;t with great Cans of this bitter Draught, as <HI>Ralegh</HI> de&s;cribes that Rain Water to have been. On the la&s;t Day of this Month, as he was rai&s;ed abruptly out of his Bed in a Sweat, by the Noi&s;e which a &s;udden great Gu&s;t had occa&s;ion'd in his Ship, he got a Cold, which turned to a burning Fever, and ca&s;t him down for twenty Days together; in which Time he receiv'd no other Su&s;tenance than a few &s;tew'd Prunes, but Drink, every Hour, both Day and Night; and &s;weated &s;o exce&s;&s;ively, that he was forced to &s;hift three Times every Day, and as often at Night. At la&s;t the Violence of his Di&s;ea&s;e was abated, by the Oranges and other Fruits he had received at <HI>Gomera</HI> of the Governor's Lady; which he had carefully pre&s;erved in Sand to his great Re|fre&s;hment; and without which, as he owns him|&s;elf, he could not have lived: But it was double the Time before he could recover in any tollerable Degree from this &s;harp Vi&s;itation.</P>
<P>In this &s;low and &s;ickly Manner they arrived at la&s;t, on the 11th of <HI>November,</HI> at the North Cape of <HI>Wiapoco.</HI> And here <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;ent for his old Ser|vant, <HI>Leonard</HI> the <HI>Indian,</HI> who had been in <HI>Eng|land</HI>

three or four Years with him; but he was re|mov'd &s;o far up in the Country, there was no pur|&s;uing him. Therefore he &s;tood away for <HI>Caliana,</HI> which is in 5 Degrees on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Guiana,</HI> at the fir&s;t Di&s;covery call'd Port <HI>Howard,</HI> where the Ca&s;&s;ique was al&s;o his Servant, and had lived with him in the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London</HI> two Years. There he arrived in a Day or two, having pa&s;&s;ed the I&s;land noted for its Multitude of Birds and Silk-bearing Trees, and from thence &s;ent for his Servant <HI>Harry,</HI> the <HI>Indian,</HI> who, with other Ca&s;&s;iques, came and brought him great Store of <HI>Ca&s;&s;avi</HI> Bread and roa&s;ted Mullets, with Plantanes, Pinas, Pi&s;tacias, &amp;c. But <HI>Ralegh</HI> ventured not to eat of the Pinas, which tempted him exceedingly, till after a Day or two's airing on the Shore in a Tent which was there pitch'd for him; then he al&s;o eat &s;ome Armadillo and a little Pork, and began to gather Strength. Here al&s;o he landed his &s;ick Men, and recovered many; and here he buried Captain <HI>Edward Ha&s;tings</HI> (the Lord <HI>Huntington</HI>'s Brother) who died ten Days or more before, and with him his Serjeant Major, <HI>Hart,</HI> and Captain <HI>Henry Snedale;</HI> the Charge of who&s;e Ship <HI>Ralegh</HI> gave to his Servant Captain <HI>Robert Smith</HI> of <HI>Cornwall.</HI> Here he al&s;o &s;et up his Barges and Shallops which they brought from <HI>Eng|land,</HI> in Quarters, clean&s;ed his Ships, trim'd up his Ca&s;ks, and &s;upply'd them with Water; fix'd up a Forge, and made &s;uch Iron Works as they wanted. Thus on that Shore, and this River they employed and refre&s;h'd them&s;elves for about three Weeks; during which Time, <HI>Ralegh</HI> was very much care&s;s'd by the <HI>Indians</HI> of his old Acquain|tance afore&s;aid, and the other Natives of this Place, who cheri&s;hed him daily with the be&s;t Provi&s;ions that the Country yielded, and offer'd him all Kind of Obedience, even to the making him their So|vereign

<P>On the 4th of <HI>December</HI> they left this River, and came next Day to the <HI>Triangle I&s;lands;</HI> but were all in Danger of leaving their Bones upon the Sholes before they got thither. For they were laid aground, e&s;pecially <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s larger Ship, for the Space of twenty-four Hours or more; and had it not been fair Weather, would never have got off the Coa&s;t, having not above two Fathom of Wa|ter.

And further, though they could never under&s;tand by <HI>Keymis,</HI> who was the fir&s;t of any Nation that had entered the main Mouth of that River, nor by any of their Mariners, who had traded there many Years for Tobacco, what Cer|tainty the Water was of; yet having found by Ex|perience, that Ships at eleven Foot Water, lay a|ground

three Days in pa&s;&s;ing up; therefore there was no attempting it with <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Ship, which being heavier, and charged with near forty Pieces of Ordnance, drew &s;eventeen Foot.

So it was re&s;olved by all, that the five larger Ships &s;hould ride at <HI>Punta de Gallo</HI> in <HI>Trinidad</HI> un|der <HI>Ralegh</HI> to &s;ecure their Retreat, and the five le&s;&s;er (for this was now the whole Number of his Fleet) with five or &s;ix Foot Companies of fifty Men each, &s;hould enter the River.

<PB N="452" REF="462">
determined to alter it, and therefore gave him his In&s;tructions in the following Words.</P>
<P><HI>Keymis,</HI> Whereas you were re&s;olv'd, after your Arrival into the <HI>Oronoque,</HI> to pa&s;s to the Mine with my Cou&s;in <HI>Herbert</HI> and &s;ix Musketiers, and to that End de&s;ired to have Sir <HI>John Ferne</HI>'s Shallop; I do not allow of that Cour&s;e; becau&s;e you cannot land &s;o &s;ecretly, but that &s;ome <HI>Indians</HI> on the River &s;ide may di&s;cover you, who giving Knowledge thereof to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> you may be cut off before you reco|ver your Boat. I therefore advi&s;e you to &s;uffer the Captains and Companies of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to pa&s;s up we&s;tward of the Mountain <HI>Aio,</HI> from whence you have no le&s;s than three Miles to the Mine, and to encamp between the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Town and you, if there is any Town near it; that being &s;o &s;ecured, you may make Trial what Depth and Breadth the Mine holds, and whether or no it will an&s;wer our Hopes. And if you find it royal, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> begin to war upon you, then let the Serjeant-major repel them, if it is in his Power, and drive them as far as he can: but if you find the Mine is not &s;o rich as to per&s;uade the holding of it, and it requires a &s;econd Supply, then &s;hall you bring but a Basket or two to &s;atisfy his Maje&s;ty that my De&s;ign was not imaginary but true, though not an&s;werable to his Maje&s;ty's Expecta|tion; for the Quantity of which I never gave A&s;&s;u|rance, nor could. On the other Side, if you &s;hall find any great Number of Soldiers are newly &s;ent in|to the <HI>Orenoque,</HI> as the Ca&s;&s;ique of <HI>Caliana</HI> told us there were, and that the Pa&s;&s;ages are already enforc'd, &s;o as without manife&s;t Peril of my Son, your&s;elf and the other Captains, you cannot pa&s;s towards the Mine; then be well advi&s;ed how you land, for I know (that a few Gentlemen excepted) what a Scum of Men you have, and I would not for all the World, receive a Blow from the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to the Di&s;honour of the Na|tion.
<PB N="453" REF="463">
I my&s;elf, for my Weakne&s;s, cannot be pre&s;ent, neither will the Company land except I abide by the Ships, the Galleons of <HI>Spain</HI> being daily expected. <HI>Piggot</HI> the Serjeant major is dead, Sir <HI>Warham St. Leger,</HI> my Lieutenant, without Hope of Life, and my Nephew, <HI>George Ralegh,</HI> your Serjeant-ma|jor, now, but a young Man: it is therefore on your Judgment that I rely; who, I tru&s;t, God will direct for the be&s;t. Let me hear from you as &s;oon as you can. You &s;hall find me at <HI>Punta de Gallo</HI> dead or alive; and if you find not my Ships there, yet there you &s;hall find their A&s;hes; for I will fire with the Galleons if it come to Extremity, but run away I will never.</P>
<P>With the&s;e In&s;tructions tho&s;e five Ships &s;et for|ward, parting from <HI>Ralegh</HI> and the re&s;t of the Fleet at the I&s;lands afore&s;aid, with a Month's Pro|vi&s;ion, on the 10th of <HI>December.</HI> But when they found a new <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Town, called <HI>St. Thome,</HI> con|&s;i&s;ting of about 140 Hou&s;es; though lightly built, with a Chapel, a Convent of <HI>Franci&s;cans,</HI> and a Garri&s;on erected on the main Channel of the <HI>Ore|noque,</HI> about Twenty Miles di&s;tant from the Place where <HI>Antonio Berreo,</HI> the Governor taken by <HI>Ra|legh</HI> in his fir&s;t Di&s;covery and Conque&s;t here, at|tempted to plant; <HI>Keymis</HI> and the re&s;t thought them&s;elves oblig'd, through Fear of leaving the Enemy's Garri&s;on between them and their Boats, to deviate from their In&s;tructions, which enjoin'd them, fir&s;t to carry a little Party to make Trial of the Mine, under a Shelter of their own Camp; and then to deal with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Town as it &s;hould give Cau&s;e, by permitting or offering to prevent them. So they concluded to land in one Body, and encamp between the Mine and the Town; whereby, though them&s;elves were &s;omething &s;tronger, their Boats were &s;ubject to the &s;ame Ex|po&s;ure,
<PB N="454" REF="464">
and the Mine left untry'd contrary to <HI>Ra|legh</HI>'s Order. For, about three Weeks after their Departure, landing, by Night, it &s;eems, nearer the Town than they &s;u&s;pected, and meaning to re&s;t them&s;elves on the River-&s;ide till morning, they were, in the Night-time, &s;et upon by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops, appriz'd of, and forearm'd for their coming, as we &s;hall &s;ee. This Charge was &s;o unexpected, and &s;truck the common Soldiers with &s;uch Amazement and Confu&s;ion, that had not the Captains and &s;ome other valiant Gentlemen made head, and animated the re&s;t, they had all been cut to pieces. But the re&s;t, by their Exam|ple, &s;oon rallying, made &s;uch a vigorous Defence again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they drove them to a Retreat, till in the Warmth of their Pur&s;uit, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> found them&s;elves at the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Town be|fore they knew where they were. Here the Bat|tle was renewed afre&s;h upon them, being a&s;&s;aulted by the Governor him&s;elf <HI>Don Diego Palameca,</HI> and four or five Captains at the Head of their Compa|nies; again&s;t whom, Captain <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> a brave and &s;prightly young Man, now twenty-three Years of Age, but fonder of Glory than Safety, not tarrying for the Musketiers, ru&s;h'd foremo&s;t, at the Head of a Company of Pikes, and having killed one of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captains, was him&s;elf &s;hot by another; but pre&s;&s;ing &s;till forward, with his Sword upon <HI>Erinetta,</HI> probably the Captain who had &s;hot him, this <HI>Spaniard</HI> with the Butt-end of his Musket fell'd him to the Ground, and after the&s;e Words, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis &s;aid in King <HI>James</HI>'s Declaration, p. 34, that young <HI>Ralegh,</HI> likelie&s;t to know his Father's Secret, when he led his Soldiers upon this Town us'd the&s;e or the like Words, <HI>Come on my Hearts, here is the Mine that we mu&s;t expect, they that look for any other Mine are Fools.</HI> As if <HI>Ralegh</HI> was at &s;o much Toil, Hazard and Expence only to break the Peace, and drive a Pack of poor <HI>Spaniards</HI> out of a worthle&s;s Town. Nor does it &s;eem likely, that if young <HI>Ralegh</HI> knew this to be his Father's Se|cret, that he would thus di&s;clo&s;e it; but rather if he did utter &s;uch an Expre&s;&s;ion, that he &s;uddenly invented it to give his Men Hopes of Booty, knowing that would be&s;t excite them to Bra|very.</NOTE><HI>Lord have mercy upon me, and pro&s;|per</HI>

<P>The Leaders being thus all di&s;patch'd, and ma|ny of their Soldiers, the re&s;t fled and were di&s;pers'd, &s;ome to &s;helter about the Market place, from whence they kill'd and wounded the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at Plea&s;ure; &s;o as they &s;aw no Way left to be &s;afe, but by firing the Town about their Ears, and driv|ing them to the Woods and Mountains, whence they &s;till kept the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> waking with perpetual Alarms. Others were more careful to defend the Pa&s;&s;ages to their Mines, of which they had three or four not far di&s;tant, than they had been to de|fend the Town it&s;elf. But for the Magazine of Tobacco, which one Writer, among other erro|neous Repre&s;entations of this Voyage, thought might countervail the Charge of it, could it with &s;ome other Things have been pre&s;erved, it &s;eems not to have been con&s;umed by the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Ralegh</HI> had enough thereof &s;oon after to have paid for the victualling of his Fleet, if there had been Occa&s;ion, as him&s;elf has related.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="466">
<HI>All Ob&s;tructions &s;eeming thus removed, Capt.</HI> Keymis <HI>had now a fair Opportunity to make what Trial he pleas'd at the Mine; and that he did at|tempt the Di&s;covery will appear by the Con&s;e|quence, as his Preparations do in the Letter he wrote to</HI> Ralegh <HI>&s;ix Days after the Action afore|&s;aid, tho' it came not long after to his Hands. Herein having open'd, in as gradual and di&s;creet a Manner as he could, how gallantly his Son fell in this Exploit, and ob&s;erved, that if</HI> his extraordi|nary Valour and Vigour of Mind had not led them all on, it had never been attempted, nor performed as it was, to his &s;urviving Honour; <HI>having al&s;o ob|&s;erv'd,</HI> that, four of the be&s;t Hou&s;es in Town be|longed to Refiners; tho' he had &s;een no Coin or Bul|lion, but only a little Plate; <HI>he adds,</HI> Now I pro|po&s;e, God willing, to vi&s;it the Mine, not eight Miles from the Town; &s;ooner I could not go by Rea&s;on of the Murmurings, the Di&s;cords and Vexations where|with the Serjeant-Major is perpetually tormented. <HI>Concluding with the&s;e Words,</HI> I have &s;ent your Lord&s;hip a Parcel of &s;catter'd Papers, and re&s;erve a Cart-load; one Roll of Tobacco, one Tortoi&s;e, with &s;ome Oranges and Lemons; praying God to give you Strength and Health of Body, and a Mind armed again&s;t all Extremities.

<P>Indeed <HI>Ralegh</HI> had need of tho&s;e Prayers, on his own Part, at this Time, not only in his Sick|ne&s;s, but even in the Intervals he had of Reco|very; for here to give &s;ome Account of him in this Time of Separation, we may ob&s;erve, that he lay with the five larger Ships under him&s;elf, Capt. <HI>John Pennington,</HI> his Vice-Admiral, one of the mo&s;t &s;ufficient Gentlemen for the Sea, that <HI>Eng|land</HI> has, &s;ays he; Sir <HI>Warham St. Leger,</HI> another

Be&s;ides, it having been fal&s;ly rumour'd in his Fleet, that he brought out of <HI>England</HI> twenty-two thou&s;and Broad-pieces of Gold with him, &s;ome of his Crew traiterou&s;ly con&s;pir'd to &s;ail away, while he was gone a&s;hore in his Barge, to take Views and make Di&s;coveries of the Coun|try, which he was &s;ometimes wont to do, as at <HI>Terra de Brea,</HI> or the <HI>Pitch-land,</HI> as he calls it, from the bitumenous Sub&s;tance which &s;o remarka|bly i&s;&s;ues there, as he has well de&s;crib'd; and when he travers'd &s;ome Woods to &s;eek the Trees that yield that precious Bal&s;am whereof he got a &s;mall Quantity, which &s;melt like Angelica; &s;o to have left him a Prey to Famine, wild Bea&s;ts, or the no le&s;s unmerciful <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by whom he might have been flea'd alive, as other <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> who came but to traffick, had formerly been.

But the Adventurers, among other Di&s;&s;ua&s;ives from all Temptation to continue there any longer, har|bour'd a Notion that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had &s;ecretly agreed with, and employ'd tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> only to trepan the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> which appear'd but a weak and ill-grounded Apprehen&s;ion to <HI>Ralegh;</HI> for &s;uch Treachery might have been ea&s;ily prevented, had they waited the Arrival of the old <HI>Indian</HI> Chief, who would have brought the Ore to their very Ships.

Moreover, one of the <HI>Indians,</HI> whom the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> found in Fetters when they took <HI>St. Thome,</HI> and brought with them aboard, could have told them, that the very Ca&s;|&s;ique, who &s;ent to &s;hew them the Gold Mine in his Country, was unconquer'd and at Enmity with the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> and could have a&s;&s;ur'd them withal, that &s;uch Mines were in that Country po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the &s;aid Ca&s;&s;ique.

<P>'Tis po&s;&s;ible that <HI>Keymis</HI> might, at his fir&s;t Re|turn, be favourably received, and ss familiarly ad|mitted to <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Table as before; for a Di&s;ap|pointment of this Con&s;equence was not to be too readily broach'd on one Side, nor reprehended on the other. Be&s;ides, as &s;ome Mitigation of their ill Succe&s;s, and Inducement to further Hopes, <HI>Key|mis</HI> produced two Ingots of Gold which had been re&s;erved at <HI>St. Thome,</HI> as the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Quota, or Proportion; together with &s;everal other valuable Spoils of the Governor. <HI>Keymis</HI> al&s;o brought with him a large Quantity of Papers, Letters, Memo|rials, Schemes, Plans and Maps found in the &s;aid Governor's Study; which gave &s;ome &s;ingular Lights into the State and Condition of <HI>Spain,</HI> with Re&s;pect to many of the <HI>American</HI> Plantations. Among the&s;e Papers were found four Letters, which plainly di&s;cover'd, not only <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s whole Enter|prize to have been betray'd, but his Life thereby put into the Power of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s fir&s;t Letter, &s;ent to <HI>Guiana</HI> by a Bark of <HI>Avi&s;o,</HI> to arm the <HI>Indians</HI> again&s;t <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Coming, was da|ted 19 <HI>March</HI> 1616, at <HI>Madrid</HI> (which Letter, &s;ays <HI>Ralegh,</HI> in his to Sir <HI>Ralph Winwood,</HI> I have, here enclo&s;ed, &s;ent you, the re&s;t I re&s;erve; not knowing whether they may be intercepted or not&punc;) The &s;econd of that King's was dated 2d of <HI>May</HI> 1617, &s;ent al&s;o by a Caravel to <HI>Diego de Palameca,</HI> Governpr of <HI>Guia|na, El Dorado</HI> and <HI>Trinidad.</HI> The third of his Maje&s;ty's, was &s;ent by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Puerto Rico,</HI> and delivered to ihat Gover|nor the 15th of <HI>July</HI> following: and the fourth was &s;ent from the Farmer and Secretary of his Cu&s;toms in the <HI>Indies</HI> at the &s;ame Time.

By the Contents of tho&s;e <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Let|ters it further appears, that three hundred <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers, and ten Pieces of Ordnance, were com|mi&s;&s;ioned to be &s;ent from their re&s;pective Garri&s;ons again&s;t, the Adventurers up the <HI>Orenoque;</HI> that is, a hundred and fifty Men from <HI>Nuevo Reyno de Gra|nada,</HI> under the Command of Captain <HI>Antonio Mu|&s;ica;</HI> and another hundred and fifty from <HI>Puerto Rico,</HI> to be conducted under <HI>Franci&s;co Zanchio.</HI> There was al&s;o prepared an <HI>Armada</HI> by Sea, to &s;et upon <HI>Ralegh</HI> him&s;elf and the Ships with him; <HI>by which, &s;ays he, we had not only been torn to pieces, but all tho&s;e in the River had al&s;o peri&s;hed, they being of no force for the Sea Fight; for we had re&s;olved to have burnt by their Sides, and to have died there, had the</HI> Armada <HI>arriv'd; but, belike, they &s;tay'd for us at</HI> Margarita, <HI>by which they knew we mu&s;t pa&s;s towards the</HI> Indies. In another Letter, which he wrote the next Day from the &s;ame I&s;land to his Wife, <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Never was poor Man expo&s;ed to Slaughter as I was.</HI> Then having related the Par|ticulars of the Forces beforemention'd, &s;ent to de|&s;troy him, through the Communication of his Scheme to the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;ador, he concludes this Part with the&s;e Words: <HI>It were too long to tell you how we were pre&s;erved; if I live, I &s;hall make it known.</HI></P>
<P>But the Indignation which <HI>Ralegh</HI> mu&s;t have conceived at the Sight of the&s;e Letters, was not a little heightned, when he came to hear that <HI>Keymis</HI> had made no actual Trial at the Mine, and the Rea&s;ons he gave for having relinqui&s;h'd it. He alledg'd indeed, that after the Salley of the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> upon them from the woody Banks, which had di&s;abled &s;everal of his Men at their fir&s;t At|tempt to land, he began to con&s;ider, they had not
<PB N="464" REF="474">
then able Men enough left to work the Mine; though indeed, it lay not &s;o deep, as to need all tho&s;e Pioneers and Implements, which, in King <HI>James</HI>'s Declaration, <HI>Ralegh</HI> is objected again&s;t for not carrying with him, as may appear by the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of this Mine, in the former Part of the&s;e Sheets. <HI>Keymis</HI> al&s;o argued, they had not Men enough to keep this Mine, though they &s;hould e&s;cape further Danger in the difficult Pa&s;&s;age to it, which he feared much they &s;hould not; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> be|ing more careful to pre&s;erve it, as was &s;aid, than the Town; and the Ways to it, <HI>A&s;pera y Frago&s;a,</HI> as <HI>Ralegh</HI> has ob&s;erved; agreeable to that Infirtili|ty and Unaptne&s;s for Cultivation, which <HI>Aco&s;ta</HI> and other Naturali&s;ts, have de&s;crib'd in tho&s;e Grounds which are impregnate with &s;uch Trea&s;ures. <HI>Key|mis</HI> urged further, that they wanted &s;ufficient Pro|vi&s;ions for the Number remaining, having been much longer up the River than they expected; and that they could not carry enough from the Town up the Mountain, their Company being divided, the greater Part, in the Town it&s;elf, and tho&s;e too weak to defend it. That he further found all Re|gard to Order and Obedience broke through, as &s;oon as Capt. <HI>Ralegh</HI> was dead; and feared the fatal News of his Death, would either not find his &s;ick Father alive, or ha&s;ten his End; that to at|tempt the Di&s;covery, and fail through any of the&s;e Di&s;couragements, he thought would be more detri|mental than wholly at this Time to decline it: that to di&s;cover it for a Pack of Profligates and Muti|neers, was more than they de&s;erv'd; and to di&s;co|ver it for <HI>Ralegh</HI> him&s;elf, not likely to live, and unpardon'd, was, as whi&s;per'd in the Company, for a Man <HI>non ens</HI> in the Law. Above all that, it would therefore be a greater Error to find it for the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> than to pretend it could no-where
<PB N="465" REF="475">
be found. La&s;tly, that the&s;e Arguments approv'd of by the Majority, were confirmed by the Alarm they received at the Di&s;covery of the Letters afore|&s;aid, in the Governor's Clo&s;et; whereby they were led, every Moment, to expect a fre&s;h Enforcement of the Enemy again&s;t them from each End of the River; therefore &s;eparate as the Fleet was, and not able to make Re&s;i&s;tance, they all agreed to re|turn.</P>
<P>However &s;pecious the&s;e Arguments, or &s;ome of them, might be, <HI>Raleigh</HI> was in no wi&s;e pacify'd with them. He utterly di&s;avowed the whole Con|duct of <HI>Keymis</HI> before &s;everal of his Company, and the Ignorance he had pretended to them; told him, that a blind Man might have found the Place, by the Marks and Directions him&s;elf had &s;et down under his own Hand; and that his Care of lo&s;ing more Men in pa&s;&s;ing the Woods was but feigned; for after his Son's Death, it was known he had no Care for any Man &s;urviving, and therefore, had he brought Home but one hundred Weight of Ore, tho' with the Lo&s;s of as many Men, it would have given the King Satisfaction, pre&s;erved his Re|putation, and encouraged a Return the next Year, with greater Force, to have held the Country for his Maje&s;ty, to whom it belonged; for the Riches and Fruitfulne&s;s whereof, him&s;elf had formerly &s;o largely atte&s;ted. But &s;ince he had &s;uffered his Wilfulne&s;s, in &s;pite of his Knowledge, to defeat their whole Undertaking, he &s;hould indeed be glad if <HI>Keymis</HI> could make tho&s;e Rea&s;ons, for not o|pening the Mine, pa&s;&s;able with the State, but that he him&s;elf could not ju&s;tify the Neglect. <HI>Keymis</HI> grew deeply di&s;contented hereat, and continued &s;o &s;everal Days. <HI>Afterwards he came to me in my Cabbin</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Ralegh) and &s;hew'd me a Letter he had written to the Earl of</HI> Arundel, <HI>excu&s;ing him|&s;elf</HI>
<PB N="466" REF="476">
<HI>for not di&s;covering of the Mine, u&s;ing the &s;ame Arguments, and many others, which he had done be|fore; and prayed me to allow thereof.</HI> But <HI>Ralegh,</HI> no Way &s;atisfied, declared that as <HI>Keymis</HI> could plead no Ignorance, he could admit of no Excu&s;e, being wounded in his Credit with the King pa&s;t all Recovery, and that this could admit of no Re|paration. <HI>Keymis,</HI> &s;eeing <HI>Ralegh</HI> re&s;olved not to favour his Folly, retired as one knowing not what Cour&s;e to take, yet expre&s;&s;ing, perhaps, al&s;o &s;ome De&s;ign of giving further Satisfaction; <HI>and went out of my Cabbin into his own,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Ralegh,</HI> where having &s;hut him&s;elf in, <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;oon after heard a Pi&s;tol go off, and &s;ending up to know who di&s;charged it, <HI>Keymis</HI> made An&s;wer, he fired it him&s;elf, becau&s;e it had been long charg'd. About half an Hour after, his Boy going into his Cabbin, found him dead, with much Blood by him, having a long Knife thru&s;t through his Left Pap into his Heart, and his Pi&s;tol lying by him, with which it appeared that he had &s;hot him&s;elf; but the Bul|let being &s;mall, and having only crack'd a Rib, he di&s;patch'd effectually with the Knife. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Letters in the <HI>Remains</HI> afore&s;aid, p. 178, 181. And the <HI>Apology,</HI> p. 39. <HI>James Howel</HI> &s;ays, that Captain <HI>Keymis,</HI> the main In&s;trument for the Di&s;covery of the Mine, pi&s;tol'd him&s;elf in a de&s;perate Mood of Di&s;content in his Cabbin in the <HI>Con|vertine;</HI> which not being <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Ship, would remove <HI>Keymis</HI>'s Death &s;till further from all Surmi&s;e that he had any &s;uch foul Play done him to prevent telling of Tales, as <HI>Sander&s;on</HI> and o|ther prejudiced Writers have maliciou&s;ly in&s;inuated.

But what entirely clears the Affair, is King <HI>James</HI>'s Declaration; for had there been the lea&s;t Shadow of Su&s;picion that <HI>Ralegh</HI> had been any Way concerned in <HI>Keymis</HI>'s unfimely End, we may be well per&s;uaded, that Declaration would not have been &s;ilent thereof, which has ama&s;s'd and aggravated &s;o many frivolous Circum&s;tances in this Voyage again&s;t him.</NOTE>And this,
<PB N="467" REF="477">
as I compute, happen'd about the latter End of <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> afore&s;aid, or perhaps the former Part of <HI>March,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Ralegh</HI> mentions it in the Letters he wrote this Month into <HI>England,</HI> before referr'd to; therefore the Death of <HI>Keymis</HI> could not hap|pen in the following Summer, as one Author mi&s;|takes. And whereas &s;ome had given it out, that <HI>Keymis</HI> &s;lew him&s;elf through Remor&s;e that he had &s;educed and deluded &s;o many Gentlemen with an imaginary Mine, <HI>Ralegh</HI> will not allow that to have been the Cau&s;e, but a&s;cribes it entirely to his own po&s;itive and pa&s;&s;ionate Temper, and &s;ays, that <HI>he would not have laid violent Hands on him&s;elf for any Man's Opinion; nor when he did, adds</HI> Ralegh, <HI>could he have &s;aid unto me that he was ignorant of the Place, and knew of no &s;uch Mine; for what Cau&s;e had I then to have rejected his Excu&s;es, or to have laid his Ob&s;tinacy to his Charge.</HI> Further urging, <HI>that &s;everal Captains,</HI> whom <HI>Ralegh</HI> names, <HI>might be put to their Oaths, whether or no,</HI> Keymis <HI>did not confe&s;s to them, coming down the River, at a Place where they ca&s;t Anchor, that he could, from thence, have gone to the Mine in two Hours.</HI></P>
<P>After this Accident it was determined, in a Coun|cil of the Officers, to make for <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> to repair and refre&s;h their Ships; but before, as well as after, they arrived there, great Di&s;orders aro&s;e: Some took to Cour&s;es of their own Head, and ran away from him, as was before-mentioned; and many others proved &s;o refractory and ungovernable, that, when he came to the I&s;le of <HI>St. Chri&s;topher's,</HI> he was forced, under the Conduct of his Cou&s;in, Mr. <HI>Her|bert,</HI> to &s;hip them Home. Of whom, tho' he had
<PB N="468" REF="478">
&s;hewed &s;ome uncommon Genero&s;ity to &s;ome of them, he &s;ays, in the Letter he wrote from thence to his Wife on the 22d of <HI>March, I know then will not &s;pare to wound me;</HI> and further declares, <HI>There is never a ba&s;e Slave in all the Fleet that hath taken the Pains and Care that I have done; that hath &s;lept &s;o little, and travell'd &s;o much: My Friends will not believe them, and for the Re&s;t I care not.</HI> In ano|ther Letter he &s;ent from hence at the &s;ame Time to Sir <HI>Ralph Winwood,</HI> he writes to the &s;ame Sen&s;e, and further adds: <HI>But the&s;e being gone, I &s;hall,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>be able, if I live, to keep the Sea till the End of</HI> Augu&s;t, <HI>with &s;ome four rea&s;onable good Ships;</HI> for to that Number was his Fleet now reduced. By the Time here propo&s;ed of continuing at Sea, there might have now been Thoughts of &s;ome Cour&s;e to qualify the Mi&s;adventure of the Mine, and enable them to re attempt it; perhaps by &s;ome little tra|ding Voyages: But how probable that he &s;hould de&s;ign any Thing &s;o far as the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> or that with &s;uch &s;mall Force he intended to go for the We&s;tern I&s;lands, to attack the <HI>Mexico</HI> Fleet, and &s;urprize the Carracks, as in the King's Declaration is laid to <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Charge, we &s;hall leave for others to decide. 'Tis plain that nothing of this was put in Practice; for when they came to <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> the Company in his own Ship mutiny'd, and tho&s;e who were for &s;taying aboard, whom <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> calls the major Part, made <HI>Ralegh,</HI> &s;ays he, take an Oath not to go Home but by their Allowance. But the Declaration &s;ays, that the greater Number were for returning to <HI>England;</HI> and that <HI>Ralegh</HI> getting on the Sea-bank put it to the Que&s;tion; where|upon the Voices divided, &s;tarboard and larboard; and that when he perceived the greater Number voted for their Return, he went to that Side and voted &s;o too; but manife&s;tly to the Hazard of his
<PB N="469" REF="479">
Life was his voting on either Side. In the &s;ame Declaration we are further led to believe, he after|wards <HI>offered his own Ship, which was of great Va|lue, to his Company, if they would only &s;et him a|board a</HI> French <HI>Bark; and that he made the &s;ame Offer to &s;ome of his Officers when he was come back to</HI> Ireland, <HI>as not knowing how Things would be con|&s;trued, and being loth to put his Head under the King's Girdle;</HI> but he did, and we &s;hall &s;ee the Con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P>By the Time that <HI>Ralegh</HI> arrived on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the &s;acking of <HI>St. Thome,</HI> the firing of the Town, and the Slaughter of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to the Number of four or five hundred Men, were largely de&s;canted on by his Enemies, as by his Friends were his own more particular Misfortunes in the long and dangerous Sickne&s;s he had endur'd; his Di&s;appointment in the Mine; the Con&s;umption of &s;o much Trea&s;ure; the Lo&s;s of his gallant Son; the violent End of his old Servant Captain <HI>Keymis;</HI> and above all the general Di&s;order, Defection, and Di&s;per&s;ion of his own Fleet. All together, it be|came not &s;o much a national as a univer&s;al Topic of Di&s;cour&s;e and Attention; every one cen&s;uring or commi&s;erating as their Intere&s;t or Affections mov'd. It is remember'd by <HI>Camden,</HI> that Captain <HI>John North,</HI> Brother to the Lord <HI>North,</HI> a valiant Gentleman, and who was much e&s;teemed by <HI>Ra|legh</HI> for his faithful Conduct under him throughout this Voyage, was the fir&s;t who related the deplo|rable News of this unfortunate Expedition to King <HI>James,</HI> on the 13th of <HI>May,</HI> 1618. He &s;eems to have done it in a very ju&s;t and pathetical Manner; and it might have had a good Effect, had that King's Pity been as ea&s;ily touch'd as his Fear. A|mong Authors, &s;ome, who had been for regi&s;ter|ing this Commi&s;&s;ion of King <HI>James</HI> with that

<P>And now the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador having, by &s;pecial Adverti&s;ements, gain'd the earlie&s;t Intelli|gence of all that had pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Guiana;</HI> and how, among the Re&s;t, his own Kin&s;man, the Governor, had been &s;lain, broke into the King's Pre&s;ence in a turbulent Manner, and bawling out for his Maje|&s;ty's Audience, only of one Word, a&s;&s;aulted him with the abrupt and repeated Exclamation of <HI>Pira|tas!

three Weeks before <HI>Ralegh</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> having left the Remainder of his Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Hands of &s;ome e&s;panioliz'd Parti&s;ans at Court, whom he had made &s;ure. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Here, &s;ince we are to take our Leave of this <HI>Don Diego Sarmiento&punc;</HI> the following Remarks upon him may not be thought very digre&s;&s;ory, &s;ince they mo&s;tly tend to the further Illu&s;tration of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s Story. His fir&s;t coming into <HI>England</HI> is remember'd by Sir <HI>John Finet,</HI> in his Ob&s;ervations touching Fo|reign Amba&s;&s;adors, to have been in 1613; being aged then, as I compute, from a Date upon one of his Pictures, 45 Years.

For, as one writes, <HI>The Bargain was made, and</HI> Ralegh <HI>was devoted for a Sacrifice before they knew whether he was &s;ucce&s;sful or not; and if we may believe the Ac|counts that are left upon Record of that Part of Hi&s;tory, the King of</HI> Spain <HI>gave a good Sum of Money for his Head. Some have gone &s;o &s;ar, as to tell us who had the Money, at lea&s;t a good Part of it. If this be true, the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Court had in it, at that Time, &s;ome of the mo&s;t infamous People that were ever concerned in any Admini&s;tra|tion. As to tho&s;e who reprove the King him&s;elf with it, I &s;hall &s;ay no more than this, they ought to have been very &s;ure of the Truth of it, before they recorded a Thing of a</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>King &s;o much beneath the Character of any Monarch in the World,</HI> viz. <HI>to take Money of an Enemy for the Blood of their own Subjects, and of &s;uch Subjects too as were mo&s;t dangerous to the very Enemy they were &s;old to; which is neither le&s;s nor more, than &s;elling their own Safety, as well as innocent Blood.</HI> See <HI>An Hi&s;torical Account of the Voyages and Adventures of Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh, 8<HI>vo.</HI> 1719, p. 38.

<P>When <HI>Ralegh</HI> had &s;ettled his Affairs in the we&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> he began his Journey to <HI>London,</HI> pur|&s;uant to his fir&s;t Re&s;olution; but before he came to <HI>A&s;hburton,</HI> twenty Miles from <HI>Plymouth,</HI> he was met by Sir <HI>Lewis Stucley;</HI> who &s;aid, <HI>he had Orders for arre&s;ting him and his Ship. Ralegh</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>he had &s;aved him the Labour, and done it to his Hands.</HI> And though at that Time <HI>Stucley</HI> had no Warrant, as our MS Author afore&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">d goes on, for &s;uch Arre&s;t, either from the King, or the Lords of the Council, <HI>for it &s;eems that his Ha&s;te was &s;o great, and his Heart &s;o &s;et upon &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed Purcha&s;e, that he could not &s;tay for a Warrant;</HI> yet <HI>Ralegh,</HI> being told by him, that he had &s;uch a verbal Commi&s;&s;ion from the Secretary, did in no wife re|&s;i&s;t even that Authority. So they went back toge|ther to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and lay at Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Harris</HI> his Hou&s;e; where Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> was &s;o little watch'd, that he was &s;ometimes two or three Days without &s;eeing Sir <HI>Lewis Stucley.</HI> And <HI>Ralegh</HI> him&s;elf &s;ays, that <HI>Stucley</HI> left him nine or ten Days to go where he li&s;ted, while he rode about the Country. However, as we learn from Captain <HI>King,</HI> it did, at la&s;t, come into <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Mind (whether upon &s;ome private Advices, how in&s;uper|ably
<PB N="478" REF="488">
the Prejudice of his Enemies was working a|gain&s;t him; or any Sugge&s;tions of his own, how he might work a Reconciliation more &s;ucce&s;sfully from abroad, it is not &s;aid, but contrive he did) to convey him&s;elf out of the Kingdom. There|fore, while they were at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> he employ'd our Author, the &s;aid Captain <HI>King,</HI> to provide him a Bark that would carry him over into <HI>France,</HI> King <HI>James</HI>'s Declaration &s;ays, <HI>Ralegh</HI> dealt with for a Bark, as for a Friend, and proffered twelve Crowns for the Pa&s;&s;age: <HI>Stucley</HI> &s;ays, he dealt with two Captains of <HI>French</HI> Barks: the Declaration &s;ays, <HI>Ralegh</HI> was then under no Guard, and <HI>Stuc|ley,</HI> that he was then under his keeping. But leaving the&s;e Inconformities to others, I here fol|low Captain <HI>King,</HI> who informs us, that him&s;elf procur'd the Ve&s;&s;el, which is mo&s;t likely, and that he detain'd it nigh four Days, riding at Anchor beyond command of the Fort. The fir&s;t Night, about one of the Clock, they &s;ecretly took Boat to have gone Aboard, but before they reach'd the Bark, <HI>Ralegh,</HI> whether through &s;ome more prevailing Thought that might ari&s;e of a generous Reliance upon the King, or a more confident Dependance upon the Ju&s;tice of his Cau&s;e, or for any thing he left behind, or would have fir&s;t left either in Writ|ing or otherwi&s;e, does not yet appear; but certain it is he changed his Re&s;olution, and returned to his Lodging un&s;u&s;pected by any one. The next Day, he &s;ent Money to the Ma&s;ter of the Bark, to retain him one Night more; and yet <HI>Ralegh</HI> never went nigh him afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>It has been objected, as Captain</HI> King <HI>goes on, (who does not &s;ay by whom, but I find it in the King's Declaration) that</HI> Ralegh <HI>was obliged to re|turn, becau&s;e the Night was &s;o Dark that he could not find the Ve&s;&s;el:</HI> But I (&s;ays the Captain) who
<PB N="479" REF="489">
was with him, will take my Oath, that if he had been only willing to have rowed a quarter of a Mile further, he might have &s;een her. Be&s;ides, if that Night would not have &s;erved, one of the other three would, the Wind being fair, and the Tide falling out conveniently.</P>
<P><HI>After this, &s;ays Captain</HI> King, Stucley <HI>received a Warrant to bring up Sir</HI> Walter Ralegh, <HI>but with no more &s;peed than his Health would permit; and he took to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, one</HI> Manourie, <HI>a</HI> French <HI>Quack,</HI> upon what Occa&s;ion (&s;ays <HI>King)</HI> I here will|ingly omit, as well becau&s;e I would not meddle with any In&s;trument of State, as becau&s;e I, little &s;u&s;pect|ing what followed, was &s;omewhat carele&s;s in the Ob|&s;ervance of their Carriage.</P>
<P>In their Journey they baited and lodg'd at divers Gentlemens Hou&s;es of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Acquaintance upon the Road, from &s;ome of whom hearing, more di|&s;tinctly the nearer he approach'd it, what a &s;torm his Enemies had brew'd at Court, he began to re|gret his having neglected the Opportunity he had at <HI>Plymouth</HI> of retiring; which he di&s;cour&s;ed of to his Lady and to Me, &s;ays Captain <HI>King,</HI> who told him, <HI>He could blame none but him&s;elf.</HI> But after that peremptory Warrant, which a Pur&s;uivant brought down for the &s;peedy bringing up of his Per&s;on, he began again to meditate upon a Retreat; tho', as he grew more de&s;irous, it grew more diffi|cult. Therefore, when he had made &s;uch inland Advancement on his Journey as to have no Means left that would favour him by Water, <HI>He once more employed me (&s;ays Captain</HI> King) <HI>who was always ready to do any thing that might procure his Safety; being well a&s;&s;ur'd in my own Con&s;cience, tho' he &s;ought to ab&s;ent him&s;elf till the</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>Fury was over, yet, as he always &s;aid; That no Mi&s;ery &s;hould make him Di&s;loyal to his King or Country.

But a&s;king <HI>Manourie</HI>'s Opinion, he truly concealed all, for that, as yet, he knew nothing of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s intended Flight; but thought it was only to gain Time to &s;atisfy his Ma|je&s;ty. However, away went <HI>Stucley</HI> to the grave Bi&s;hop <HI>Andrews,</HI> then upon the Point of his Tran|&s;lation to <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and &s;oon made known what a frightful Figure Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> was become; de&s;cribed all the Tokens upon him, and, in the End, return'd with two Doctors, and one Batche|lor of Phy&s;ick. All their Skill could not enlighten them with one Spark of Knowledge in the Nature of his Di&s;temper; but they gave their Opinion in Writing, that the Patient could not be removed into the Air without manife&s;t Hazard of his Life; and <HI>Manourie</HI> &s;et his Hand to it.</P>
<P>Here, <HI>Ralegh</HI> is de&s;crib'd to have been much delighted that Matters went on &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly, e&s;|pecially that the Vomit worked &s;o thoroughly in the pre&s;ence of the&s;e learned Doctors. But having apprehended they would in&s;pect his Water, he di|rected <HI>Manourie</HI> to rub the Urinal with a certain D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ug, which turned all to &s;uch a di&s;mal Colour, and &s;uch a di&s;agreeable Scent, that if Heaven did not pre&s;cribe, the Patient mu&s;t peri&s;h; for nothing

could the Phy&s;icians do but pronounce the Di&s;ea&s;e mortal.

By this Time his Phy&s;ick having opened his Stomach and made him hungry, he got <HI>Manourie</HI> &s;ecretly to buy a Leg of Mutton and three Loaves, which he fed upon in private, and by this Subtilty, was thought to have fa&s;ted three Days, that is to <HI>Friday</HI> the la&s;t of <HI>July,</HI> ever feigning great Indi&s;po&s;ition and Unea|&s;ine&s;s in Company; but when alone, for to get the Opportunity of being &s;o was the chief Source of all the Artifice he did here really put in Practice, he wrote his Declaration or Apology, and is &s;aid to have got <HI>Manourie</HI> to make him a Tran&s;cript of it; which was, as the Penman of this Story further &s;ays, &s;ince pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty.

It was &s;urely a mo&s;t vexatious Stratagem, that <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;hould un|expectedly make &s;uch a provoking Vindication of his Voyage, and thereby defeat the Preparations that were making to cut him off for it: but how|ever it may&punc; in the Opinion of Po&s;terity, have cleared his innocence; among his Cotemporaries, it could not &s;ecure his Safety.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Night, as the Story goes on, appa|rently to ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e inflammations beyond his own Per&s;on, he in&s;inuated to <HI>Stucley,</HI> that he thought he had ta|ken Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">n at Mr. <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ham</HI>'s, for that he was a Pa|pi&s;t,

<P>The <HI>French</HI> Agent having form'd a De&s;ign of conveying Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> to <HI>France, Mon&s;ieur de la Che&s;naye</HI> was examined before the Lords of the Council, who confe&s;s'd that <HI>Le Clerc</HI> had employ'd him for that Purpo&s;e. <HI>Le Clerc</HI> was then cited to appear before them; but as Punctilios often ari&s;e in Relation to Amba&s;&s;adors, &s;o here a Di&s;pute &s;prung up, which &s;eem'd to add to the Indignation already conceiv'd again&s;t Sir <HI>Walter;</HI> for <HI>Le Clerc</HI> refus'd to an&s;wer any Interrogatories, till the Lords of the Council &s;hould &s;tand up and be uncovered as he was, in|&s;i&s;ting that Sir <HI>W.

<P>And now comes on the Remainder of Captain <HI>King</HI>'s Narrative; wherein he tells us, that from <HI>Salisbury</HI> he was &s;ent before to <HI>London</HI> to provide a Boat, and to lay her as low as <HI>Tilbury:</HI> and that he was al&s;o advi&s;ed to put one <HI>Cotterell</HI> in Tru&s;t, who had been <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Servant, for the Provi&s;ion of a Wherry. As &s;oon as <HI>King</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> he dealt with <HI>Cotterell,</HI> who &s;eem'd as willing to do Sir <HI>Walter</HI> Service as him&s;elf; but telling him of one <HI>Hart,</HI> who had been Boat&s;wain to the &s;aid Captain's Ship, and had a Ketch of his own; with him the Captain therefore agreed, and gave him Money to get it in Readine&s;s, having vowed Secre|cy upon the Reward which the Captain further promi&s;ed him. But he had no &s;ooner received the <HI>thirty Pieces of Silver,</HI> than he betray'd the De|&s;ign to Mr. <HI>William Herbert,</HI> who as &s;uddenly di|vulg'd it; but <HI>King</HI> not &s;u&s;pecting any Di&s;covery, &s;till fed <HI>Hart</HI> with Money to keep the Ketch at <HI>Tilbury.</HI></P>
<P>On Friday Night, which was the 7th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> when Captain <HI>King</HI> attended on him at his Lodgings, but was told by <HI>Ralegh</HI> that he could in no wi&s;e get ready to go off that Night. It &s;eems to be the next Day that <HI>Stucley</HI> got his Warrant to indemnify him for any Contract he &s;hould enter into with Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> or to authorize his Compliance with any
<PB N="492" REF="502">
Offer he &s;hould make him for his E&s;cape; or in &s;hort, as others have not &s;pared to call it, a Li|cence to betray him; for tho' <HI>Ralegh</HI> might now have been &s;ecur'd in a direct and undi&s;gui&s;ed Man|ner, yet the Glory was to do it in&s;idiou&s;ly, and un|der the Vizor of Friend&s;hip; being not more &s;uit|able to the Genius of predominant Power, than nece&s;&s;ary on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, to give Room for &s;o many more little Circum&s;tances of Objection, as might occur to &s;upply the Place of one wanting, that &s;hould have been capital. And this Night it was that the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador afore&s;aid, came to <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and made the Propo&s;al before recited. But when Capt. <HI>King</HI> came to him again the &s;ame Night, <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;aid there was no going now without <HI>Stucley,</HI> whom he doubted not but he &s;hould engage to go along with him, and that the next Night, without Failure, he would meet the Captain at the <HI>Tower-Dock.</HI> As for Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> afore&s;aid, he was employ'd in <HI>garrowing</HI> Sir <HI>Wal|ter Ralegh</HI>'s Hou&s;e, as the Captain phra&s;es it, while <HI>Ralegh,</HI> being thus drawn out of it by <HI>Stuc|ley,</HI> under Pretence of bearing him Company, might be the more unexpectedly &s;eiz'd with all &s;uch private Papers as he &s;hould have about him; in Hopes, no doubt, that by one means or other, &s;omething might turn out to make a Charge of &s;uf|ficient Weight again&s;t him. But, in the Conclu|&s;ion, &s;ays our &s;aid Author, all the Papers which were found, prov'd to be no other, than what might, without any Di&s;credit, have been laid open to all the World.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>King</HI> went, as he further tells us, on <HI>Sun|day</HI> Night to the Place appointed with two Wher|ries; and Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> al&s;o came thither; having put on a fal&s;e Beard, and a Hat with a green Hatband. He was accompany'd with Sir <HI>Lewis</HI>
<PB N="493" REF="503">
<HI>Stucley,</HI> young <HI>Stucley,</HI> and his own Page. Then a&s;king Captain <HI>King,</HI> if all Things were ready? he an&s;wer'd, they were, and that the Cloak-bag and the four Pi&s;tols were in the Boat. <HI>Stucley</HI> then &s;aluted Captain <HI>King,</HI> and a&s;k'd, <HI>whether</HI> thus far <HI>he had not di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf an hone&s;t Man?</HI> to which <HI>King</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>that he hop'd he would</HI> con|tinue <HI>&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>After they enter'd the Boats and divided the Pi|&s;tols, they had not rowed above twenty Strokes before the Watermen told them, that Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> had lately taken Boat, and made as if he would have gone through Bridge, but return'd down the River after them. This rais'd &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion in <HI>Ralegh,</HI> but upon <HI>Stucley</HI>'s Encouragement they row'd on; yet <HI>Ralegh,</HI> not well &s;atisfy'd, call'd Captain <HI>King</HI> near to him, who was in the other Boat with young <HI>Stucley</HI> and <HI>Hart,</HI> and intimated, that he could not go forward unle&s;s he was &s;ure of the Watermen, whom he then al&s;o &s;pake to, a&s;k|ing, whether if any &s;hould come to arre&s;t them in the King's Name, they would row forwards or re|turn. At this, the great Boobies were &s;o frighten'd that they cry'd, and an&s;wer'd, they knew no bo|dy there but Captain <HI>King,</HI> who had hired them to <HI>Grave&s;end;</HI> and that they neither dared, nor would go any further. <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;aid, that a brabbling Matter with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, was the Cau&s;e that of Nece&s;&s;ity he mu&s;t go to <HI>Tilbury</HI> to embark for the <HI>Low Countries;</HI> and that he would give them ten Pieces of Gold for their Pains.</P>
<P>Then began <HI>Stucley</HI>'s Part, cur&s;ing and damning him&s;elf that he &s;hould be &s;o unfortunate as to ven|ture his Life and Fortune with a Man &s;o full of Doubts and Fears. He &s;wore that if the Watermen would not row on, he would kill them; and per|&s;uaded <HI>Ralegh</HI> that there was no &s;uch Danger as he
<PB N="494" REF="504">
&s;u&s;pected; of which Opinion Capt. <HI>King</HI> al&s;o &s;till was. Thus the Time pa&s;s'd till they drew near <HI>Greenwich,</HI> when a Wherry cro&s;s'd them, which <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;aid came to di&s;cover them. <HI>King</HI> &s;ought to di&s;&s;uade him from this Suppo&s;ition, and told him that if they could but reach <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> he would hazard his Life to get to <HI>Tilbury.</HI> The&s;e Delays &s;pent the Tide, and the Watermen &s;aid, it was im|po&s;&s;ible to get to <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> before Morning. Here|upon <HI>Ralegh</HI> would have landed at <HI>Purfleet,</HI> and <HI>Hart</HI> would have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him, that tho' it was Night he could procure him Hor&s;es to <HI>Tilbury. Stucley</HI> appear'd very zealous for this Propo&s;al, and &s;aid, that upon that Condition he could be content to carry the Cloak-bag on his own Shoulders half a Mile; but <HI>King</HI> told him, that if they could not go by Water, it was impo&s;&s;ible at that Time of Night to get Hor&s;es to go by Land.</P>
<P>By this Time they had rowed as far as <HI>Woolwich,</HI> or rather about a Mile beyond, which might be to a Reach call'd the <HI>Gallions</HI> near <HI>Plum&s;tead.</HI> Here, approaching two or three Ketches, <HI>Hart</HI> began to doubt, whether any one of them was his. Upon this, <HI>Ralegh</HI> concluded they were all betray'd, and bid the Watermen turn back, hoping to have got to his own Hou&s;e before Morning; and began to examine <HI>Hart</HI> very &s;trictly, who pretended he had given his Men expre&s;s Charge not to &s;tir from <HI>Tilbury</HI> till he came down; but this would not in|duce <HI>Ralegh</HI> to proceed. Before they had rowed back a Furlong, they e&s;pied another Wherry, and hailing her, they &s;aid they were for the King. <HI>Ra|legh</HI> perceiving they were &s;ome of Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI>'s Crew, propo&s;ed to <HI>Stucley,</HI> &s;eeing they were di&s;co|ver'd, and in Re&s;pect to his Safety, that he might remain &s;till in his Cu&s;tody, and that <HI>Stucley</HI> &s;hould openly declare to the Watermen he was his Pri|&s;oner,
<PB N="495" REF="505">
which he did. Here <HI>Stucley</HI> and he fell in|to private Di&s;cour&s;e, contriving how <HI>Ralegh</HI> might reach his Hou&s;e; and how <HI>Stucley</HI> might &s;ave him|&s;elf harmle&s;s by &s;aying, that he only pretended to go along with <HI>Ralegh,</HI> in order to di&s;cover his In|tentions, and &s;eize upon his private Papers. Then they whi&s;per'd &s;ome Time together, and <HI>Ralegh</HI> taking &s;ome Things out of his Pockets (whether more Rubies powder'd with Diamonds) our Au|thor does not &s;ay) and gave them to <HI>Stucley,</HI> who all this while not only hugg'd and embrac'd him, as it &s;eem'd with the greate&s;t Tenderne&s;s, but made the utmo&s;t Prote&s;tations of Love, Friend&s;hip, and Fidelity. When they were got back to <HI>Greenwich, Stucley</HI> &s;aid, that he dur&s;t not carry <HI>Ralegh</HI> to his Hou&s;e, but per&s;uaded him to land, which they did; the other &s;trange Boat landing at the &s;ame Time, in which the Men, they perceived, belong'd to Mr. <HI>W. Herbert</HI> and Sir <HI>William St. John,</HI> the &s;ame who had made good Profit of <HI>Ralegh</HI> before, as we have read. Upon <HI>Greenwich</HI> Bridge <HI>Stucley</HI> told Capt. <HI>King</HI> it would be for Sir <HI>Walter</HI>'s Good, that he &s;hould pretend he was con&s;enting with him to betray his Ma&s;ter. <HI>King,</HI> not able to fathom the Depth of this Policy, as he tells us, refus'd it, thinking he &s;hould not only thereby bely his own Con&s;cience; but make him&s;elf odious to the World; therefore, tho' <HI>Ralegh</HI> him&s;elf made &s;ome Motion of it to him, he could not, how &s;erviceable &s;oever it might prove, be guilty of &s;o much In&s;incerity towards him. Then <HI>Stucley</HI> arre&s;ted the Captain in his Maje&s;ty's Name, and committed him to the Charge of two of Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI>'s Men. After this they all went to a Tavern, and by the way, Cap|tain <HI>King</HI> heard <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;ay, <HI>Sir</HI> Lewis, <HI>the&s;e Ac|tions will not turn out to your Credit. Ralegh</HI> was kept apart from <HI>King</HI> till Morning, when as they
<PB N="496" REF="506">
enter'd into the Tower, <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;aid to him, <HI>Stuc|ley</HI> and <HI>Cotterell</HI> have betray'd me; adding, for your Part, you need be in Fear of no Danger, but as for me, it is I am the Mark that is &s;hot at. Then Captain <HI>King,</HI> being forced to take his leave, left <HI>Ralegh,</HI> to his Tuition, with whom I do not doubt <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> but his Soul re&s;teth. And &s;o con|cludes his Narrative.</P>
<P>Here the curious Reader would probably be willing to know what <HI>Stucley</HI> had to &s;ay for him&s;elf upon this Bu&s;ine&s;s; and this I have &s;ome Oppor|tunity of relating from the Tract he publi&s;h'd at <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Death in his own Defence; which tho', for its Author's Behaviour afore&s;aid, it has been &s;o much di&s;regarded, that of all the Hi&s;torians gene|ral and particular, who have written of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> and &s;ome few of them, who&s;e Characters are pretty well known, to his Di&s;paragement; I never met with one who has &s;hewn it &s;o much Cre|dit as to quote it: Yet, as I have found &s;ome few Pa&s;&s;ages not altogether u&s;ele&s;s in explaining other Parts of this Life, &s;o tho&s;e, which concern this Part, I have thought proper more particularly here to in&s;ert, in ob&s;ervance to a good biographical Maxim, which enjoins us, as far as the Parts they bear in our Narrative will permit, to &s;hew a due Re&s;pect to the Characters of all Men, and con&s;e|quently not, in Favour of any, to pro&s;titute our own.</P>
<P>In this Tract, which is properly enough ad|dre&s;s'd to the King, one of the earlie&s;t Motives to Revenge, in that poor In&s;trument of State, as <HI>Stucley</HI> no le&s;s properly calls him&s;elf, again&s;t <HI>Ra|legh,</HI> appears to be a Pretence, that <HI>Ralegh</HI> had abridg'd <HI>Stucley</HI>'s Father of an incredible dividend in a Prize many Years before taken at Sea, where|of a more particular Account has been before given
<PB N="497" REF="507">
in its proper Place; as the la&s;t Motive will appear to be what <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;aid of this <HI>Stucley</HI> in his dying Speech. But the Arguments <HI>Stucley</HI> makes U&s;e of for having betray'd him, are drawn fir&s;t from <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s having pretended to be poi&s;on'd at Sir <HI>Edward Parham</HI>'s Hou&s;e who was <HI>Stucley</HI>'s Kin&s;man. For he reports <HI>Ralegh</HI> to have &s;aid, <HI>Tho' the Gentleman would not hurt me, yet there might be Prie&s;ts that did it: for I remember, after my Morning's Draught of a Cup of Ale, which Sir</HI> Edward Parham <HI>offer'd me in the Hall, I felt pre&s;ently a kind of Excoriation in my Bowels, as if &s;ome Je&s;uit had been the But|ler. Now, &s;ays</HI> Stucley, <HI>when I &s;aw the Pu&s;tles break out upon him at</HI> Sali&s;bury, <HI>my Compa&s;&s;ion, I confe&s;s, was too credulous to report it.</HI> But that be|ing thus deceived him&s;elf, and thereby wronging his Kin&s;man, it moved his Indignation again&s;t <HI>Ra|legh</HI> for abu&s;ing both: &s;o that in &s;hort, he drew <HI>Ralegh</HI> to his De&s;truction by a Lie, becau&s;e he had induced <HI>Stucley</HI> to a&s;per&s;e his Kin&s;man with one. And tho' Divinity would not, as <HI>Stucley</HI> owns, yet Rea&s;on of State would hold it lawful to lie for the Di&s;covery of Trea&s;on, in &s;ervice to the Common|wealth. Then he endeavours to reconcile him&s;elf to the Commonwealth, by an&s;wering the Objection of his being &s;o In&s;trumental to the depriving it of &s;o &s;ufficient a Member as had not left his Equal be|hind him, in the&s;e Words: <HI>No Man denies but he had many Sufficiencies in him: But what were the&s;e but &s;o many Weapons of Practice and Danger again&s;t the State; if he e&s;caped? being &s;o deeply tainted in &s;o many Points of Di&s;content, Di&s;hone&s;ty, and Di&s;loyal|ty. He knew, as he had written, that as in Nature, &s;o in Policy,</HI> a privatione ad habitum not fit re|gre&s;&s;io. <HI>And therefore being de&s;perate of any For|tune here, agreeable to the Height of his Mind, who can doubt but he would have made up his Fortune</HI>
<PB N="498" REF="508">
<HI>el&s;ewhere, upon any Terms again&s;t his Soveraign and Country?</HI> In another Place, which relates to <HI>Ra|legh</HI>'s la&s;t Endeavours of e&s;caping, he tells the King, <HI>On the</HI> Saturday <HI>when I received your Ma|je&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ion by my Cou&s;in</HI> Herbert, <HI>I received al&s;o Intelligence by him, that at that In&s;tant</HI> Ralegh <HI>was flying from my Cu&s;tody without my Privity, not having, as yet, made him any Semblance of Conde|&s;cent: &s;o that I almo&s;t came upon him unawares, even, as he was putting on his fal&s;e Beard, and o|ther Di&s;gui&s;ements; which declares he did &s;till di&s;|tru&s;t your Goodne&s;s, doubtle&s;s out of the Con&s;cience of his Guiltine&s;s, whatever he writ or &s;aid to the con|trary. And is it any marvel then, that he was angry with me at his Death for bringing him back? Be&s;ides, being a Man, as he was thought, of &s;o great a Wit, it was no &s;mall Grief that a Man of &s;o mean Wit as I &s;hould be thought to go beyond him. Yea, but you &s;hould not have u&s;ed &s;uch Craft to go beyond him. No?</HI> Sic ars deluditur arte. Neque enim lex ju&s;tior ulla e&s;t quam necis artifices arte perire &s;ua. <HI>But why did you not execute your Commi&s;&s;ion bravely to his Apprehen&s;ion on him in his Hou&s;e? Why? my Commi&s;&s;ion was to the contrary, to di&s;cover his Pre|ten&s;ions, and to &s;eize his &s;ecret Papers, &amp;c. And can any hone&s;t Subject que&s;tion my Hone&s;ty in the Per|formance of &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion, which tended to di&s;|cover the &s;ecret Intentions of an ill-affected Heart to my Soveraign? How can any di&s;like this in me, and not bewray his own di&s;hone&s;t Heart unto the State? Yea, but tho' another might have done this, yet how might you do it, being his Kin&s;man and his Friend? Surely if I had been &s;o; yet in a publick Employment and Tru&s;t laid upon me, I was not to refu&s;e it, much le&s;s to prefer private Kindne&s;s and Amity before my publick Duty and Loyalty: for what did I know the dangerous Con&s;equence of the&s;e Matters which were to</HI>

<PB N="500" REF="510">
Fomentation to &s;upple the Minds of the unea&s;y People, that the &s;overaign Unguent might enter more effectually. But how little Satisfaction the &s;aid Declaration gave, we have already noted; and for <HI>Stucley</HI>'s Performance, it made not &s;o much as him&s;elf ea&s;y; being, in his own Opinion, &s;o in|&s;ufficient to deface the black and odious Stains of his Conduct, that he was forced to write an Apology be&s;ides; and that was &s;o little regarded, as never to have been thought worthy of the Pre&s;s. Whe|ther his Life was more &s;ucce&s;sful than his Writings, and how it fared with him after this Piece of Court|&s;ervice, may be gathered from &s;everal Authors. Some hi&s;torical Compurgators of this Reign, and con&s;equently no Friend to Ralegh's Memory, yet own, that Stucley's De&s;tiny was &s;uitable to his Dealings, being afterwards hang'd, &s;ay they, for clipping of Gold. But tho&s;e who had better Intel|ligence, and knew the Truth more particularly, have delivered it more perfectly; where they af|firm, <Q>That <HI>Stucley</HI> having, for a Bag of Money, fal&s;i|fied his Faith, which he had confirmed by the Tie of the Holy Sacrament, he was, before the Year came about, caught clipping the &s;ame Coin, in the King's own Hou&s;e at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> which he had received as the Reward of his Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s; for which being eondemned to be hang'd, he was driven to &s;ell him&s;elf to his Shirt, to purcha&s;e his Pardon of two Knights. Then (to avoid the Sight and Scorn of Mankind) withdrew him&s;elf to a little I&s;land in the Severn Sea, called the <HI>I&s;le of Lundy,</HI> and there died a poor di|&s;tracted Beggar:</Q> Which, as we find it el&s;ewhere &s;ufficiently confirmed, was in le&s;s than two Years after <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Death.

<HI>Ralegh,</HI> as was before mentioned, was now Pri|&s;oner again in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> being brought thither on <HI>Monday</HI> Morning the 10th of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> About two or three Days after, a Committee was &s;elected to examine into the afore&s;aid E&s;cape, it being a Matter luckily capable, and highly nece&s;|&s;ary to be enlarged upon, in order to fill up the Mea&s;ure of Accu&s;ation.

Then again, for Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> to alienate him&s;elf thus from his native Country by Means of a foreign Power, was &s;tretch'd out to the Idea of a Separa|tion as horrid as the Breach of &s;ome huge Rock or Promontory from the main Land, when its Foun|dation was &s;ap'd and wa&s;h'd away by undermining Waves.</P>
<P>The Arguments <HI>Ralegh</HI> now returned to exte|nuate this mighty Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, having been by no Author tran&s;mitted to us, it is not impo&s;&s;ible but they were, with the re&s;t of his Ju&s;tification be|fore tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners, during the Time of this his la&s;t Impri&s;onment, indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;tifled.

lawfully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for the Crown; at lea&s;t, &s;o far, as not to renounce or circumvent his own Commi&s;|&s;ion: otherwi&s;e, how well he knew that if he made the lea&s;t Oppo&s;ition to any Re&s;i&s;tance of his At|tempt, he was liable to be pur&s;ued as an Invader; or if he returned with any Gold, to be per&s;ecuted as a Plunderer by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and if he did nei|ther, that he was &s;till no le&s;s liable to be accus'd as an Impo&s;tor by his Co-adventurers. But in this latter Re&s;pect, all Su&s;picion was clearly removed, even from tho&s;e who by their Lo&s;&s;es in this Voyage would have been mo&s;t readily prompted to make &s;uch Reproach, when they found <HI>Ralegh</HI> prove him&s;elf as in the&s;e Writings, to the Face of Man|kind, &s;uch a far greater Lo&s;er than any of the re&s;t hereby, as was before ob&s;erved: And as for the other two Objections, <HI>Ralegh</HI> has al&s;o made it no le&s;s amply evident in the &s;ame Pieces, how glaringly he mu&s;t appear to the World, a mere premeditated or de&s;igned Sacrifice to one of them, if King <HI>James</HI> &s;hould maim his Soveraignty of its Title to <HI>Guiana,</HI> or now di&s;claimed the Undertaking there which he had before authorized.

A Method, however, of di&s;patching him being thus piec'd out, the King, or tho&s;e with whom he left the Management of this Affair when he went upon his Progre&s;s, appear'd very eager for bring|ing it to a Period.

<P>The next Morning, being <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 29th of <HI>October,</HI> and the <HI>Lord-Mayor's-Day,</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> was conducted, by the Sheriffs of <HI>Middle|&s;ex,</HI> to the Old <HI>Palace-yard</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> where there was a large Scaffold erected before the <HI>Par|liament-hou&s;e</HI> for his Execution. He had on a wrought Night-cap under his Hat, a Ruff Band, a black wrought Velvet Night-Gown over a Hair|colour'd Sattin Doublet, and a black wrought Wai&s;tcoat, a Pair of black cut Taffety Breeches, and A&s;h-colour'd Silk Stockings. He mounted the Scaffold with a chearful Countenance, and &s;a|luted the Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen of his Acquaintance there pre&s;ent. Then Proclamation
<PB N="517" REF="527">
being made by an Officer for Silence, he intro|duc'd his Speech with informing them, that as he was ye&s;terday taken out of his Bed in a &s;trong Fit of a Fever, which much weaken'd him, and who&s;e Untimeline&s;s forbearing no Occa&s;ion or Place, he expected it again To-day; therefore did fir&s;t implore God, that he would pre&s;erve him from the Interruptions thereof at this Time, and next de&s;ired the Audience, if any Di&s;ability of Voice or Dejection of Countenance &s;hould appear in him, that they would impute it rather to the Di&s;order of his Body than any Di&s;may of Mind. Then pau&s;ing a little, he &s;at down, and directed him&s;elf towards a Window, where the Lords <HI>A|rundel, Northampton, Donca&s;ter,</HI> with other No|bles were &s;itting, and begun his Speech. But they being at &s;ome Di&s;tance from the Scaffold, he ap|prehended they did not plainly di&s;tingui&s;h his Words, therefore &s;aid, he would &s;train his Voice, for that he would willingly have them hear him. To which the Lord <HI>Arundel</HI> an&s;wer'd, they would rather come down to the Scaffold; which he and &s;ome others did. Then Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> having &s;aluted them &s;everally, began again, as fol|lows:</P>
<P>I thank God, that he has &s;ent me to die in the Light and not in Darkne&s;s. I likewi&s;e thank God, that he has &s;uffer'd me to die before &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly of honourable Witne&s;&s;es, and not ob&s;curely in the <HI>Tower;</HI> where, for the Space of thirteen Years together, I have been oppre&s;s'd with many Mi&s;eries. And I re|turn him Thanks, that my Fever hath not taken me at this Time, as I prayed to him it might not; that I might clear my&s;elf of &s;ome Accu&s;ations unju&s;tly laid to my Charge, and leave behind me the Te&s;timony of a true Heart both to my King and Country.</P>
<P><PB N="518" REF="528">
There are two main Points of Su&s;picion that his Maje&s;ty hath conceived again&s;t me, and which, I con|ceive, have &s;pecially ha&s;tned my coming hither; there|fore I de&s;ire to clear them to your Lord&s;hips, and re|&s;olve you in the Truth thereof. The fir&s;t is, that his Maje&s;ty hath been inform'd, I have had &s;ome Plot or Confederacy with <HI>France,</HI> for which he had &s;ome rea|&s;ons, tho' grounded upon a weak Foundation. One was, that when I return'd to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> I endeavoured to go to <HI>Rochel,</HI> which was becau&s;e I would fain have made my Peace before I came to <HI>England.</HI> Another Rea&s;on was, that again I would have bent my Cour&s;e to <HI>France,</HI> upon my la&s;t intended E&s;cape from <HI>Lon|don,</HI> being the Place where I might have the be&s;t Means of making &s;uch Peace, and the be&s;t Safeguard during that Terror from above. The&s;e, join'd with the coming of the <HI>French</HI> Agent to my Hou&s;e here in <HI>London,</HI> only to confer about my &s;aid Voyage, to|gether with the report of my having a Commi&s;&s;ion from the King of <HI>France,</HI> might occa&s;ion my being &s;o &s;u&s;pected in this particular, and his Maje&s;ty to be &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed with me. But this I &s;ay; for a Man to call God to Witne&s;s at any Time to a Fal&s;hood, is a grievous Sin. To call him as Witne&s;s to a Fal&s;hood at the Point of Death, when there is no Time for Re|pentance, is a Crime far more impious and de&s;pe|rate; therefore, for me to call that Maje&s;ty to wit|ne&s;s an Untruth, before who&s;e Tribunal I am in&s;tant|ly to appear, were beyond Mea&s;ure &s;inful, and with|out Hope of Pardon. I do yet call that great God to witne&s;s, that, as I hope to &s;ee him, to be &s;aved by him, and live in the World to come, I never had any Plot or Intelligence with the <HI>French</HI> King, ne|ver had any Commi&s;&s;ion from him, nor &s;aw his Hand or Seal; that I never had any Practice or Combina|tion with the <HI>French</HI> Agent, nor ever knew or &s;aw &s;uch a Per&s;on, till I met him in my Gallery unlook'd
<PB N="519" REF="529">
for. If I &s;peak not true, O Lord, let me never in|ter into thy Kingdom.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Su&s;picion or Imputation was, that his Maje&s;ty hath been informed, I had &s;poken di&s;loyally of him. The only Witne&s;s of this was, a ba&s;e <HI>Frenchman,</HI> a Renegade, a chymical Fellow, whom I &s;oon knew to be perfidious; for being drawn by him into the Action of freeing my&s;elf at <HI>Winche|&s;ter,</HI> in which I confe&s;s my Hand was touch'd, he, being &s;worn to Secrecy over-night, revealed it the next Morning. 'Tis &s;trange, that &s;o mean a Fellow could &s;o far incroach him&s;elf into the Favour of the Lords; and, gaping after &s;ome great Reward, could &s;o fal&s;ly accu&s;e me of &s;editious Speeches again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, and be &s;o credited. But this I here &s;peak, it is no Time for me to flatter or to fear Princes, I, who am &s;ubject only unto Death; and for me, who have now to do with God alone, to tell a Lye to get the Favour of the King were in vain: And yet, if ever I &s;pake di&s;loyally or di&s;hone&s;tly of the King, either to this <HI>Frenchman</HI> or any other; ever intimated the lea&s;t Thought hurtful or preju|dicial of him, the Lord blot me out of the Book of Life.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I did attempt to e&s;cape, and it was only to &s;ave my Life. I likewi&s;e confe&s;s, that I feigned my&s;elf to be indi&s;po&s;ed at <HI>Salisbury;</HI> but I hope it was no Sin; for the Prophet <HI>David</HI> did make him&s;elf a Fool, and &s;uffer'd Spittle to fall upon his Beard to e&s;cape from the Hands of his Enemies, and it was not imputed unto him as a Sin: what I did, was only to prolong Time, till his Maje&s;ty came, in Hopes of &s;ome Commi&s;eration from him.</P>
<P>But I forgive that <HI>Frenchman;</HI> and likewi&s;e Sir <HI>Lewis Stucley,</HI> the Wrongs he hath done me with all my Heart; for I have received the Sacrament this Morning of Mr. <HI>Dean,</HI> and I have forgiven all Men;
<PB N="520" REF="530">
but, in Charity to others, am bound to caution them again&s;t him, and &s;uch as he is. For Sir <HI>Lewis Stucley,</HI> my Keeper and Kin&s;man, hath affirmed, that I &s;hould tell him, my Lord <HI>Carew</HI> and my Lord of <HI>Donca&s;ter</HI> here, did advi&s;e me to e&s;cape; but I pro|te&s;t before God, I never told him any &s;uch Thing; neither did the&s;e Lords advi&s;e me to any &s;uch Matter. It is not likely I &s;hould acquaint two Privy Coun&s;ellors of my E&s;cape; or that I &s;hould tell him, my Keeper, it was their Advice; neither was there any Rea&s;on to tell it him, or he to report it; for it was well known, he left me &s;ix, eight, or ten Days together alone, to go whither I li&s;ted, while he rode about the Country. He further accus'd me, that I &s;hould &s;hew him a Letter, whereby I did &s;ignify, that I would give him ten thou|&s;and Pounds to e&s;cape; but God ca&s;t my Soul into ever|la&s;ting Fire if ever I made &s;uch Proffer of ten thou|&s;and Pounds, or one thou&s;and Pounds; but indeed, I &s;hewed him a Letter, that if he would go with me, there &s;hould be Order taken for the Di&s;charge of his Debts when he was gone; neither had I one thou&s;and Pounds, for, if I had, I could have made my Peace better with it otherwi&s;e than by giving it <HI>Stucley.</HI> Further, he gave out, when I came to Sir <HI>Edward Parham</HI>'s Hou&s;e, who had been a Follower of mine, and gave me good Entertainement, I had there recei|ved &s;ome Dram of Poi&s;on. When I an&s;wer'd that I feared no &s;uch Thing, for I was well a&s;&s;ur'd of tho&s;e in the Hou&s;e; and therefore wi&s;hed him to have no &s;uch Thought. Now I will not only &s;ay, that God is the God of Revenge, but al&s;o of Mercy; and I de&s;ire God to forgive him, as I hope to be forgiven. <HI>Then ca&s;ting his Eye upon his Note of Remembrance, he went on thus:</HI></P>
<P>It was told the King, that I was brought perforce into <HI>England;</HI> and that I did not intend to return again. Whereas Captain <HI>Charles Parker,</HI> Mr.
<PB N="521" REF="531">
<HI>Tre&s;ham,</HI> Mr. <HI>Leak,</HI> and divers others that knew how I was dealt withal by the common Soldiers, will witne&s;s to the contrary. They were an hundred and fifty of them who mutiny'd again&s;t me, and &s;ent for me to come to them; for unto me they would not come. They kept me clo&s;e Pri&s;oner in my Cabbin, and for|ced me to take an Oath, that I would not go into <HI>England</HI> without their Con&s;ent, otherwi&s;e they would have ca&s;t me into the Sea. After I had taken this Oath, I did, by Wine, Gifts, and fair Words, &s;o work upon the Ma&s;ter-gunner, and ten or twelve of the Faction, that I won them to de&s;i&s;t from their Pur|po&s;es, and intended, when I returned home, to procure their Pardon; in the mean while propo&s;ed, that I would di&s;po&s;e of &s;ome of them in <HI>Ireland;</HI> to which they agreed, and would have gone into the North Parts, from which I di&s;&s;uaded them, and told them, they were <HI>Red-&s;hanks</HI> who inhabited there, &s;o drew them to the South; and the better to clear my&s;elf of them, was forced to get them an hundred and fifty Pounds at <HI>King&s;ale,</HI> otherwi&s;e I had never got from them.</P>
<P>There was a Report al&s;o, that I meant not to go to <HI>Guiana</HI> at all; and that I knew not of any Mine, nor intended any &s;uch Matter, but only to get my Liberty, which I had not the Wit to keep. But it was my full Intent to go for Gold, for the Benefit of his Maje&s;ty, my&s;elf, and tho&s;e who went with me, with the Re&s;t of my Countrymen: tho' he that knew the Head of the Mine, would not di&s;cover it when he &s;aw my Son was &s;lain, but made him&s;elf away. <HI>Then turning to the Earl of</HI> Arundel, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> My Lord, you be|ing in the Gallery of my Ship at my Departure, I re|member you took me by the Hand, and &s;aid, you would reque&s;t one Thing of me; which was, whether I made a good Voyage or a bad, that I would return again into <HI>England;</HI> which I then promis'd, and gave you
<PB N="522" REF="532">
my Faith I would. So you did, &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, 'tis true, and they were the la&s;t Words I &s;aid to you. An|other &s;lander was rai&s;ed of me, that I &s;hould have gone away from them, and have left them at <HI>Guiana;</HI> but there were a great many worthy Men, who ac|companied me always, as my Serjeant-major, and di|vers others (whom he nam'd) that knew it was none of my Intention. Al&s;o it hath been &s;aid, that I &s;tint|ed them of fre&s;h Water; to which I an&s;wer, every one was, as they mu&s;t be in a Ship, furni&s;h'd by Mea|&s;ure, and not according to their Appetites. This Cour&s;e all Seamen know mu&s;t be u&s;ed among them, and to this Straight were we driven. Another Opinion was held, that I carried with me &s;ixteen thou&s;and Pieces of Gold; and that all the Voyage I intended, was but to gain my Liberty, and this Money into my Hands: But as I &s;hall an&s;wer it before God, I had no more in all the World, directly or indirectly, than one hundred Pounds, whereof I gave about forty-five Pounds to my Wife. But the Ground of this fal&s;e Report was, that twenty thou&s;and Pounds being ad|ventured, and but four thou&s;and appearing in the Surveyor's Books, the Re&s;t had my Hand to the Bills for divers Adventures; but, as I hope to be &s;av'd, I had not a Penny more than one hundred Pounds. The&s;e are the material Points I thought good to &s;peak of; I am at this In&s;tant to render my Account to God, and I prote&s;t, as I &s;hall appear before him, this that I have &s;poken is true.</P>
<P>I will borrow but a little Time more of Mr. <HI>Sheriff,</HI> that I may not detain him too long; and herein I &s;hall &s;peak of the Imputation laid upon me through the Jealou&s;y of the People, that I had been a Per&s;ecutor of my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> that I rejoiced in his Death, and &s;tood in a Window over-again&s;t him when he &s;uffer'd, and puff'd out Tobacco in Defiance of him; when as, God is my Witne&s;s, that I &s;hed Tears for
<PB N="523" REF="533">
him when he denied; and, as I hope to look God in the Face hereafter, my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> did not &s;ee my Face at the Time of his Death; for I was far off, in the Armory, where I &s;aw him, but he &s;aw not me. 'Tis true, I was of a contrary Faction; but I take the &s;ame God to witne&s;s, that I had no Hand in his Death, nor bare him any ill Affection, but always believed it would be better for me that his Life had been pre&s;erved; for after his Fall, I got the Hatred of tho&s;e who wi&s;hed me well before; and tho&s;e who &s;et me again&s;t him, &s;et them&s;elves afterwards again&s;t me, and were my greate&s;t Enemies: And my Soul hath many Times been grieved, that I was not nearer to him when he died; becau&s;e, as I under&s;tood after|wards, he a&s;ked for me at his Death, and de&s;ired to have been reconciled to me.</P>
<P>And now I entreat, that you all will join with me in Prayer to that great God of Heaven, whom I have grievou&s;ly offended, being a Man full of all Va|nity, who has lived a &s;inful Life in &s;uch Callings as have been mo&s;t inducing to it; for I have been a Sol|dier, a Sailor, and a Courtier, which are cour&s;es of Wickedne&s;s and Vice; that his Almighty Goodne&s;s will forgive me; that he will ca&s;t away my Sins from me; and that he will receive me into everla&s;ting Life: So I take my leave of you all, making my Peace with God.</P>
<P>Then Proclamation being made, that all Men &s;hould depart the Scaffold, he prepared him&s;elf for Death, giving away his Hat and Gap and Money to &s;ome Attendants who &s;tood near him. When he took leave of the Lords and other Gentlemen, he intreated the Lord <HI>Arundel</HI> to de&s;ire the King, that no &s;candalous Writings to defame him might be publi&s;h'd after his Death. Concluding, <HI>I have a long Journey to go, therefore mu&s;t take my leave.</HI>
<PB N="524" REF="534">
Then having put off his Gown and Doublet, he call'd to the Head&s;man to &s;hew him the Ax, which not being &s;uddenly done, he &s;aid, <HI>I pr'ythee let me &s;ee it. Do&s;t thou think that I am afraid of it?</HI> Hav|ing finger'd the Edge of it a little he return'd it, and &s;aid, &s;miling, to the Sheriff, <HI>This is a &s;harp Medicine, but it is a &s;ound Cure for all Di&s;ea&s;es;</HI> and having intreated the Company to pray to God to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;trengthen him, the Executioner kneel|ed down and a&s;ked him Forgivene&s;s; which <HI>Ra|legh,</HI> laying his Hand upon his Shoulder, granted. Then being a&s;ked, which way he would lay him|&s;elf on the Block, he an&s;wer'd, <HI>So the Heart be right, it is no Matter which way the Head lies.</HI> As he &s;toop'd to lay him&s;elf along, and reclined his Head, his Face being towards the Ea&s;t, the Head&s;|man &s;pread his own Cloak under him. After a little Pau&s;e, he gave the Sign that he was ready for the Stroke by lifting up his Hand, and his Head was &s;truck off at two Blows, his Body never &s;hrink|ing or moving. His Head was &s;hew'd on each &s;ide of the Scaffold, and then put into a red Leather Bag, and, with his Velvet Night-gown thrown over it, was afterwards conveyed away in a Mourning Coach of his Lady's. His Body, as we are told, was buried hard by, in the Chancel of St. <HI>Margaret</HI>'s Church, near the Altar; but his Head was long pre&s;erved in a Ca&s;e by his Widow, for &s;he &s;urvived him twenty-nine Years, as I have found by &s;ome Anecdotes remaining in the Fami|ly; and after her Death, it was kept al&s;o by her Son <HI>Carew,</HI> with whom it is &s;aid to have been Buried.</P>
<P>Thus have we &s;een how Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> after a &s;hining and con&s;picuous Series of Actions again&s;t the Enemies of his Country, and for the Improve|ment of Navigation as well as the Enlargement and
<PB N="525" REF="535">
Enrichment of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire, under one So|veraign, was deprived of his Liberty, his E&s;tate, and his Life under another; how Sir <HI>Walter Ra|legh,</HI> who had been one of the greate&s;t Scourges of <HI>Spain,</HI> was made a Sacrifice to it; how the Servi|ces of Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> I &s;ay, in Camp, in Court, by Land, by Sea, with Sword and Pen, were an Honour to Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign; and how his Sufferings at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> by Im|pri&s;onment, by Law, with Slander and the Ax, were the Di&s;grace of King <HI>James</HI>'s. Writers vary in their Accounts of his Age; but the mo&s;t credi|ble Hi&s;torians inform us, that he was &s;ixty-&s;ix Years Old at his Execution. Yet was it conjectured, by the extraordinary Effu&s;ion of Blood from his Veins, that he had Stock and Strength enough left of Na|ture to have &s;urvived many Yaars. <HI>His Death was managed by him, as one Author has ob&s;erved, with &s;o high and religious a Re&s;olution, as if a</HI> Roman <HI>had acted a</HI> Chri&s;tian, <HI>or rather a</HI> Chri&s;tian <HI>a</HI> Ro|man: And this is confirm'd by Sir <HI>Richard Hut|ton</HI>'s Evidence, who &s;ays, <HI>He died in a good and religious Manner; &s;pake much, and without any Fear of Death &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the Block; by his Death he gained great Reputation in this Life, and, by the Grace and Mercy of God, Remi&s;&s;ion of his Sins and Eternal Life hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>And now, &s;ince it is Time to clo&s;e the Scene, <HI>Let this glorious and gallant Cavalier, who&s;e Ene|mies have confe&s;s'd he was one of the weightie&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Men that this I&s;land ever bred, re&s;t in his Grave, and may his Virtues live in Po&s;terity;</HI> whom to in&s;pire therewith, the Felicities of Commemora|tion, however here di&s;po&s;ed of, &s;eem to have &s;ig|nally combin'd; having tran&s;mitted many ample Te&s;timonies, how emulous the Harmony of Re|cord and the Spirit of Communication have been

<P><PB N="529" REF="539">
THAT he did con&s;pire, and go about to deprive the King of his Government, to rai&s;e up Sedition within the Realm, to alter Religion, to bring in the Roman Super&s;tition, and to procure foreign Enemies to invade the Kingdom. That the Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">th of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t, did meet with the &s;aid Sir <HI>Wal|ter Ralegh</HI> in <HI>Durham</HI> Hou&s;e, in the Pari&s;h of <HI>St. Martin's in the Fields,</HI> and then and there had Con|ference with him how to advance <HI>Arabella Stuart</HI> to the Crown and royal Throne of this Kingdom; and that then and there it was agreed, That <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;hould treat with <HI>Aremberg,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from the Arch-Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> to obtain of him <HI>600,000</HI> Crowns, to bring to pa&s;s their intended Trea&s;ons. It was agreed, That <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;hould go to <HI>Albert</HI> the Arch-duke, to procure him to advance the pretended Title of <HI>Arabella:</HI> From thence, knowing that <HI>Al|bert</HI> had not &s;ufficient Means to maintain his own Army in the <HI>Low-Countries, Cobham</HI> &s;hould go to <HI>Spain</HI> to procure the King to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and further her pretended Title.</P>
<P>It was agreed, the better to effect all this Con&s;pi|racy, That <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;hould write three Letters, one to the Arch-duke, another to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and a third to the Duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI> and promi&s;e three Things: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To e&s;tabli&s;h a firm Peace between <HI>Eng|land</HI> and <HI>Spain. Secondly,</HI> To tolerate the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Super&s;tition. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> To be ruled by them in contracting of her Marriage.</P>
<P>And, for the effecting the&s;e traiterous Purpo&s;es, <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;hould return by the I&s;le of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> and &s;hould there find Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh,</HI> Captain of the &s;aid I&s;le, and take Coun&s;el of <HI>Ralegh</HI> for the di&s;tri|buting of the afore&s;aid Crowns, as the Occa&s;ion or Di&s;contentment of the Subjects &s;hould give Cau&s;e and Way.</P>
<P>And further, That <HI>Cobham</HI> and his Brother <HI>Brook</HI> met on the <HI>9</HI>th of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t, and <HI>Cobham</HI>
<PB N="530" REF="540">

<P>And the more to di&s;able and deprive the King of his Crown, and to confirm the &s;aid <HI>Cobham</HI> in his Intents, <HI>Ralngh</HI> did publi&s;h a Book, fal&s;ly written again&s;t the mo&s;t ju&s;t and Royal Title of the King, knowing the &s;aid Book to be written again&s;t the ju&s;t Title of the King; which Book <HI>Cobham</HI> after that received of him. Farther, for the better effecting the&s;e traiterous Purpo&s;es, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;aid <HI>Brook</HI> in his Intent, the &s;aid <HI>Cobham</HI> did deliver the &s;aid Book unto him, the <HI>14</HI>th of <HI>June.</HI> And further, the &s;aid <HI>Cobham,</HI> on the <HI>16</HI>th of <HI>June,</HI> for Accom|pli&s;hment of the &s;aid Conference, and, by the traite|rous In&s;tigation of <HI>Ralegh,</HI> did move <HI>Brook</HI> to incite <HI>Arabella</HI> to write to the three forenamed Princes to procure them to advance her Title; and that &s;he, af|ter &s;he had obtained the Crown, &s;hould promi&s;e to perform three Things, <HI>viz. 1.</HI> Peace between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain. 2.</HI> To tolerate with Impunity, the <HI>Po|pi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Super&s;titions. <HI>3.</HI> To be ruled by them three, in the contracting of her Marriage.</P>
<P>To the&s;e Motions, the &s;aid <HI>Brook</HI> gave his A&s;&s;ent; and for the better effecting of the &s;aid Trea&s;ons, <HI>Cob|ham,</HI> on the <HI>17</HI>th of <HI>June,</HI> by the In&s;tigation of <HI>Ra|legh,</HI> did write Letters to Count <HI>Aremberg,</HI> and did deliver the &s;aid Letters to one <HI>Matthew de Law|rency,</HI> to be delivered to the &s;aid Count, which he did deliver, for the obtaining of <HI>600,000</HI> Crowns; which Money, by other Letters, Count <HI>Aremberg</HI> did promi&s;e to perform the Payment of; and this Letter <HI>Cobham</HI> received the <HI>18</HI>th of <HI>June.</HI> And then did

<P>You have heard of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s bloody Attempts, to kill the King and his royal Progeny, and, in Place thereof, to advance one <HI>Arabella Stuart.</HI> The Particulars of the Indictment are the&s;e: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That <HI>Ralegh</HI> met with <HI>Cobham</HI> the 9th of <HI>June,</HI> and had Conference of an Inva&s;ion, of a Rebellion, and an In&s;urre|ction, to be made by the King's Subjects, to de|po&s;e
<PB N="532" REF="542">
the King, and to kill his Children, poor Babes, that never gave Offence: Here is Blood, here is a new King and Governor. In our King con&s;i&s;ts all our Happine&s;s, and the true U&s;e of the Go&s;pel; a Thing, which we all wi&s;hed to be &s;et|led after the Death of the Queen. Here mu&s;t be Money to do this, for Money is the Sinew of War. Where &s;hould that be had? Count <HI>Aremberg</HI> mu&s;t procure it of <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> 5 or 600,000 Crowns, and out of this Sum, <HI>Ralegh</HI> mu&s;t have 8000; then there mu&s;t be Friends to effect this. <HI>Cobham</HI> mu&s;t go to <HI>Albert,</HI> Arch-Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> from whom <HI>Aremberg</HI> was Amba&s;&s;ador at that Time in <HI>England.</HI> And what then? He mu&s;t per&s;uade the Duke to a&s;&s;i&s;t the pretended Title of <HI>Arabella.</HI> From thence <HI>Cobham</HI> mu&s;t go to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and per&s;uade him to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;aid Title. Since the Conque&s;t, there was never the like Trea&s;on. But out of who&s;e Head came it; Out of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s, who mu&s;t al&s;o advi&s;e <HI>Cobham</HI> to u&s;e his Brother <HI>Brook</HI> to incite the Lady <HI>Arabella</HI> to write three &s;everal Let|ters, as afore&s;aid in the Indictment; all this was on the 9th of <HI>June.</HI> Then three Days after, <HI>Brook</HI> was acquainted with it: After this, <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Brook,</HI> 'Twill never be well in <HI>England,</HI> till the King and his Cubs are taken away. Afterwards <HI>Ralegh</HI> delivered a Book to <HI>Cobham,</HI> treacherou&s;ly written again&s;t the Title of the King. It appears, that <HI>Cobham</HI> took <HI>Ralegh,</HI> to be either a God, or an Idol. <HI>Gobham</HI> endeavours to &s;et up a new King, or Governor. God forbid, mine Eyes &s;hould ever &s;ee &s;o unhappy a Change. As for the Lady <HI>Ara|bella,</HI> &s;he, upon my Con&s;cience, hath no more Title to the Crown than I have; which, before God, I utterly renounce. <HI>Cobham,</HI> a Man bred in <HI>England,</HI> hath no Experience abroad. But <HI>Ralegh,</HI> a Man of great Wit, Military, and a Sword-man. Now whether the&s;e Things were bred in a hollow

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Edward Coke, the King's Attorney.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t fir&s;t, My Lords, before I come to the Cau&s;e, give one Caution; becau&s;e we &s;hall often mention Per|&s;ons of eminent Places, &s;ome of them great Mo|narchs: Whatever we &s;ay of them, we &s;hall but repeat what others have &s;aid of them; I mean the capital Offenders in their Confe&s;&s;ions: We, pro|&s;e&s;&s;ing Law, mu&s;t &s;peak reverently of Kings and Potentates. I perceive the&s;e honourable Lords, and the re&s;t of this great A&s;&s;embly, are come to hear what hath been &s;cattered upon the Wreck of Report. We carry a ju&s;t Mind, to condemn no Man, but upon plain Evidence. Here is Mi&s;chief, Mi&s;chief <HI>in &s;ummo gradu,</HI> exorbitant Mi&s;chief. My Speech &s;hall chiefly touch the&s;e three Points; Imitation, Supportation, and Defence.</P>
<P>The Imitation of Evil ever exceeds the Prece|dent, as on the contrary, Imitation of Good ever comes &s;hort. Mi&s;chief cannot be &s;upported, but by Mi&s;chief: Yea, it will &s;o multiply, that it will bring all to Confu&s;ion. Mi&s;chief is ever underprop'd by Fal&s;hood of foul Practices. And becau&s;e all the&s;e Things did concur in the&s;e Trea&s;ons, you &s;hall under&s;tand the Main, as before you did the Bye.</P>
<P>The Trea&s;on of the Bye, con&s;i&s;teth in the&s;e Points: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Lord <HI>Grey, Brook, Markham,</HI> and the re&s;t, intended by Force in the Night, to &s;ur|prize the King's Court; which was a Rebellion in the Heart of the Realm, yea, in the Heart of the Heart, in the Court. They intended to make him, that is a Sovereign, &s;ubject to their Power, purpo|&s;ing to open the Doors with Mu&s;quets and Calivers, and to take al&s;o the Prince and Council. Then, under the King's Authority, to carry the King to the <HI>Tower,</HI> and to make a <HI>State of the Admiral:</HI> When they had the King there, to extort three
<PB N="534" REF="544">
Things from him. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A Pardon for all their Trea&s;ons. <HI>Secondly,</HI> A Toleration of the <HI>Roman</HI> Super&s;tition: Which their Eyes &s;hall &s;ooner fall out, than they &s;hall ever &s;ee; for the King hath &s;poken the&s;e Words in the hearing of many, <HI>I will lo&s;e the Crown and my Life, before ever I will alter Religion.</HI> And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> To remove Coun&s;ellors: In the Room of the Lord Chancellor, they would have placed one <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> a Prie&s;t, ab&s;urd in Huma|nity, and ignorant in Divinity. <HI>Brook,</HI> of whom I will &s;peak nothing, Lord Trea&s;urer; the great Se|cretary mu&s;t be <HI>Markham, Oculus Patriae.</HI> A Hole mu&s;t be found in my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice's Coat. <HI>Grey</HI> mu&s;t be Earl Mar&s;hal and Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, be|cau&s;e he would have a Table in the Court: Marry, he would advance the Earl of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> to a higher Place. All this cannot be done without a Multitude. Therefore <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> the Prie&s;t telleth a re&s;olute Man, That the King was in Danger of Puritans and Je|&s;uits; &s;o to bring him in Blindfold into the Action; &s;aying, That the King is no King till he be crown'd, therefore every Man might right his own Wrongs: But he is <HI>Rex Natus,</HI> his Dignity de|&s;cends as well as yours, my Lords. Then <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> impo&s;eth a bla&s;phemous Oath, that they &s;hould &s;wear to defend the King's Per&s;on, to keep &s;ecret what was given them in Charge, and &s;eek all Ways and Means to advance the Catholick Religion. Then they intend to &s;end for the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen, in the King's Name, to the <HI>Tower,</HI> le&s;t they &s;hould make any Re&s;i&s;tance, and then to take Ho&s;tages of them; and to enjoin them to provide for them Victuals and Munition. <HI>Grey,</HI> becau&s;e the King removed before <HI>Mid&s;ummer,</HI> had a further Reach, to get a Company of Sword&punc;men to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Action: Therefore he would &s;tay till he had obtain'd a Regiment from <HI>O&s;tend</HI> or <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> So you &s;ee, the&s;e Trea&s;ons were like <HI>Samp&s;on</HI>'s Foxes,

which were joined in their Tails, tho' their Heads were &s;ever'd.</P>

Secondly,</HI> They avouched Scripture; both the Prie&s;ts had, <HI>Scriptum e&s;t;</HI> perverting and ignorant|ly mi&s;taking the Scriptures. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> They avouch|ed the Common Law to prove, That he was no King till he was crowned, alledging a Statute of 13 <HI>Eliz.</HI> This, by Way of Imitation, hath been the Cour&s;e of all Traytors.</P>
<P>In the 20th of <HI>Edward</HI> II. <HI>I&s;abella</HI> the Queen, and the Lord <HI>Mortimer,</HI> gave out, That the King's Per&s;on was not &s;afe, for the Good of the Church and Commonwealth.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> did preach on this Text, <HI>My Head is grieved;</HI> meaning by the Head, the King; that when the Head began to be negligent, the People might reform what is amifs.</P>
<P>In the 3d of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. Sir <HI>Roger Claringdon,</HI> accompanied with two Prie&s;ts, gave out, that <HI>Ri|chard</HI> II. was alive, when he was dead.</P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> III. cau&s;ed <HI>Mortimer</HI>'s Head to be cut off, for giving Couu&s;el to murther the King.</P>
<P>The 3d of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. Sir <HI>Henry Stanley</HI> found the Crown in the Du&s;t, and &s;et it on the King's Head. When <HI>Fitzwater</HI> and <HI>Garret</HI> told him, that <HI>Edward</HI> V. was alive, he &s;aid, <HI>If he be alive, I will a&s;&s;i&s;t him:</HI> But this co&s;t him his Head.</P>
<P><HI>Edmund de la Pole,</HI> Duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> killed a Man in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. for which the King would have him hold up his Hand at the Bar, and then pardoned him. Yet he took &s;uch Offence
<PB N="536" REF="546">
thereat, that he &s;ent to the Noblemen, to help to reform the Commonwealth; and then &s;aid, he would go to <HI>France</HI> and get Power there. Sir <HI>Ro|ger Compton</HI> knew all the Trea&s;on, and di&s;covered <HI>Windon</HI> and others that were attainted.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, there was another Thing that would be &s;tood upon, namely, that they had but one Witne&s;s; then he vouched one <HI>Appleyard</HI>'s Ca&s;e <HI>(Temp. Eliz.)</HI> a Traytor in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who &s;aid a Man mu&s;t have two Accu&s;ers. <HI>Helmes</HI> was the Man that accu&s;ed him; but Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Catlin</HI> &s;aid, that that Statute was not in Force at that Day; his Words were, <HI>Thru&s;t her into the Ditch.</HI></P>
<P>Then he went on &s;peaking of Accu&s;ers, and mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> this Difference: An Accu&s;er is a Speaker by Re|port; when a Witne&s;s is he, that upon his Oath &s;hall &s;peak his Knowledge of any Man.</P>
<P>A third Sort of Evidence there is likewi&s;e, and this is held more forcible than either of the other two; and that is, when a Man, by his Accu&s;ation of another, &s;hall, by the &s;ame Accu&s;ation, al&s;o condemn him&s;elf, and make him&s;elf liable to the &s;ame Fault and Puni&s;hment: This is more forcible than many Witne&s;&s;es. So then, &s;o much by Way of Imitation. Then he defined Trea&s;on: There is Trea&s;on in the Heart, in the Hand, in the Mouth, in Con&s;ummation; comparing that <HI>in Corde</HI> to the Root of a Tree; <HI>in Ore,</HI> to the Bud; <HI>in Manu,</HI> to the Blo&s;&s;om; and that which is <HI>in Con&s;ummatione,</HI> to the Fruit.</P>
<P>Now I come to your Charge, you of the Jury: The Greatne&s;s of Trea&s;on is to be con&s;idered in the&s;e two Things, <HI>Determinatione finis,</HI> and <HI>Ele|ctione medicorum.</HI> This Trea&s;on excelleth in both, for that it was to de&s;troy the King and his Proge|ny.

<P>Yes, when we deliver the Proofs to be read. <HI>Ralegh</HI> procured <HI>Cobham</HI> to go to <HI>Arem|berg,</HI> which he did by his In&s;tigation: <HI>Ralegh</HI> &s;up|ped with <HI>Cobham</HI> before he went to <HI>Aremberg;</HI> af|ter Supper, <HI>Ralegh</HI> conducted him to <HI>Durham</HI> Hou&s;e; from whence <HI>Cobham</HI> went with <HI>Lawrency,</HI> a Servant of <HI>Aremberg</HI>'s, unto him, and went in by a Back-way. <HI>Cobham</HI> could never be quiet un|til he had entertain'd this Motion, for he had four Letters from <HI>Ralegh. Aremberg</HI> an&s;wered, the Mo|ney &s;hould be performed, but knew not to whom it &s;hould be di&s;tributed. Then <HI>Cobham</HI> and <HI>Law|rency</HI> came back to <HI>Durham</HI> Hou&s;e, where they found <HI>Ralegh. Cobham</HI> and <HI>Ralegh</HI> went up, and left <HI>Lawrency</HI> below, where they had &s;ecret Confe|rence in a Gallery, and after <HI>Cobham</HI> and <HI>Lawrency</HI> departed from <HI>Ralegh.</HI> Your Jargon was Peace!

<P>By this Book, you would per&s;uade Men, that he is not the lawful King. Now let us con&s;ider &s;ome Circum&s;tances: My Lords, you know my Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> (for whom we all lament, and rejoice; lament in that his Hou&s;e, which hath &s;tood &s;o long un&s;potted, is now ruinated: Rejoice, in that his Trea&s;ons are revealed) is neither Politi|cian nor Sword-man; <HI>Ralegh</HI> was both, united in the Cau&s;e with him, and therefore Cau&s;e of his De&s;truction. Another Circum&s;tance is, the &s;ecret contriving of it. <HI>Humphry Stafford</HI> claimed Sanctu|ary for Trea&s;on, <HI>Ralegh</HI> in his <HI>Machiavilian</HI> Poli|cy hath made a Sanctuary for Trea&s;on. He mu&s;t talk with none but <HI>Cobham,</HI> becau&s;e (&s;aith he) one Witne&s;s can never condemn me. For <HI>Brook</HI> &s;aid unto Sir <HI>Griffith Markham,</HI> take heed how you do make my Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> acquainted; for what&s;oever he knoweth, <HI>Ralegh</HI> the Witch will get it out of him. As &s;oon as <HI>Ralegh</HI> was examined on one Point of Trea&s;on concerning my Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> he wrote to him thus; <HI>I have been examined of you, and confe&s;&s;ed nothing.</HI> Further, you &s;ent to him
<PB N="540" REF="550">
by your tru&s;ty <HI>Francis Kemi&s;h,</HI> that one Witne&s;s could not condemn; and therefore bad his Lord|&s;hip be of good Courage. Came this out of <HI>Cob|ham</HI>'s Quiver? No: But out of <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s <HI>Machia|velian</HI> and Devili&s;h Policy. Yea, but <HI>Cobham</HI> did retract it: Why then did you urge it? Now then &s;ee the mo&s;t horrible Practices that ever came out of the bottomle&s;s Pit of the lowe&s;t Hell. After that <HI>Ralegh</HI> had Intelligence that <HI>Cobham</HI> had ac|cu&s;ed him, he endeavoured to have Intelligence from <HI>Cobham,</HI> which he had gotten by young Sir <HI>John Payton:</HI> But I think it was the Error of his Youth.</P>

<P>The Lords told it me, or el&s;e I had not been &s;ent to the Tower.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Attorney.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus <HI>Cobham,</HI> by the In&s;tigation of <HI>Ralegh,</HI> entred into the&s;e Actions: So that the Que&s;tion will be, Whether you are not the princi|pal Traytor, and he would neverthele&s;s have entred into it? Why did <HI>Cobham</HI> retract all that &s;ame? <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e <HI>Ralegh</HI> was &s;o odious, he thought he &s;hould fare the wor&s;e for his Sake. 2<HI>dly,</HI> He thought thus with him&s;elf, if he be free, I &s;hall clear my&s;elf the better. After this, <HI>Cobham</HI> a&s;ked for a Preacher to confer with, pretending to have Dr. <HI>Andrews;</HI> but indeed, he meant not to have him, but Mr. <HI>Galloway,</HI> a worthy and reverend Preacher, who can do more with the King (as he &s;aid) than any other; that he, &s;eeing his con&s;tant Denial, might inform the King thereof. Here he plays with the Preacher. If <HI>Ralegh</HI> could per|&s;uade the Lords, that <HI>Cobham</HI> had no Intent to tra|vel, then he thought all &s;hould be well. Here is Forgery. In the Tower, <HI>Cobham</HI> mu&s;t write to Sir <HI>Thomas Vane,</HI> a worthy Man, That he meant not to go into <HI>Spain;</HI> which Letter <HI>Ralegh</HI> devi&s;ed in <HI>Cobham</HI>'s Name.</P>

<P>At my fir&s;t Examination at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> my Lords a&s;ked me, what I knew of <HI>Cobham</HI>'s Practice with <HI>Aremberg;</HI> I an&s;wered negatively: And as concerning <HI>Arabella,</HI> I prote&s;t before God, I never heard one Word of it. If that be proved, let me be guilty of a thou&s;and Trea&s;ons. It is a &s;trange Thing you will impute that to me, when I never heard &s;o much as the Name of <HI>Arabella Stuart,</HI> but only the Name of <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>After being examined, I told my Lords, that I thought my Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> had Conference with <HI>Aremberg,</HI> l &s;u&s;pected his vi&s;iting of him: For after he departed from me at <HI>Durham</HI> Hou&s;e, I &s;aw him pa&s;s by his own Stairs, and pa&s;&s;ed over to St. <HI>Mary-Saviours,</HI> where I knew <HI>Lawrency</HI> a Merchant, and a Follower of <HI>Aremberg,</HI> and therefore likely to go unto him. My Lord <HI>Cecil</HI> a&s;ked my Opinion con|cerning <HI>Lawrency;</HI> I &s;aid, That if you do not ap|prehend <HI>Lawrency,</HI> it is dangerous, he will fly; if you do apprehend him, you &s;hall give my Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> Notice thereof. I was a&s;ked likewi&s;e, Who was the greate&s;t Man with my Lord <HI>Cobham?</HI> I an&s;wered, I knew no Man &s;o great with him, as young <HI>Wyat</HI> of <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;aw my Letter to have di&s;co|vered his Dealing with <HI>Aremberg,</HI> in his Fury he accu&s;ed me; but before he came to the Stair-foot he repented him, and &s;aid, he had done me wrong. When he came to the End of his Accu&s;ation, he added, That if he had brought this Money to <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> that I would have delivered him and the Money to the King. Mr. <HI>Attorney,</HI> You &s;aid this never came out of <HI>Cobham</HI>'s Quiver, he is a &s;imple Man: Is he &s;o &s;imple? No: He hath Di&s;po&s;itions of his own, he will not ea&s;ily be guided by others, but when he has once taken Head in a Matter, he is not ea&s;ily drawn from it; he is no Babe. But it is &s;trange for me to devi&s;e with <HI>Cobham,</HI> that he
<PB N="544" REF="554">
&s;hould go to <HI>Spain,</HI> to per&s;uade the King to di&s;|bur&s;e &s;o much Money, he being a Man of no Love in <HI>England,</HI> and I having re&s;igned my Room of chiefe&s;t Command, the Warden&s;hip of the <HI>Stan|naries:</HI> Is it not &s;trange for me, to make my&s;elf <HI>Robin Hood,</HI> or a <HI>Kitt,</HI> or a <HI>Cade;</HI> I knowing <HI>Eng|land</HI> to be in better E&s;tate to defend it&s;elf than ever it was. I knew <HI>Scotland</HI> united, <HI>Ireland</HI> quieted, <HI>Denmark</HI> a&s;&s;ured, which before was &s;u&s;pected. I knew that having lo&s;t a Lady whom Time had &s;ur|pri&s;ed, we had now an active King, a lawful Suc|ce&s;&s;or. The State of <HI>Spain</HI> was not unknown to me. I had written a Di&s;cour&s;e, which I had in|tended to pre&s;ent unto the King, again&s;t Peace with <HI>Spain.</HI> I knew the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had &s;ix Re|pul&s;es, three in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and three at Sea, and once in 1588 at <HI>Cales,</HI> by my Lord Admiral. I knew he was di&s;couraged and di&s;honoured. I knew the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to be the proude&s;t Prince liv|ing; but now he cometh creeping to the King my Ma&s;ter for Peace. I knew, whereas before he had in his Ports &s;ix or &s;even Score Sail of Ships, he hath now but &s;ix or &s;even. I knew of twenty-five Mil|lions he had from his <HI>Indies,</HI> he hath &s;carce one left. I knew him &s;o poor, that the Je&s;uits in <HI>Spain,</HI> who were wont to have &s;uch large Allow|ance, were fain to beg at the Church-door. Was it ever read or heard, that any Prince &s;hould di&s;|bur&s;e &s;o much Money, without a &s;ufficient Pawn? I knew her own Subjects, the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> would not lend her Maje&s;ty Money, without Lands in Mortgage. I knew the Queen did not lend the <HI>States</HI> Money, without <HI>Flu&s;hing, Brill,</HI> and other Towns for a Pawn. And can it be thought, he would let <HI>Cobham</HI> have &s;o great a Sum?</P>
<P>I never came to the Lord <HI>Cobham</HI>'s, but about Matters of his Profit, as the ordering of his Hou&s;e, paying of his Servants Board-wages, &amp;c. I had
<PB N="545" REF="555">

<P><Q>The Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> being required to &s;ub&s;cribe to an Examination, there was &s;hewed a Note under <HI>Ra|legh</HI>'s Hand, the which when he had peru&s;ed, he pau&s;ed, and after brake forth into the&s;e Speeches: Oh Villain! Oh Traytor! I will now tell you all the Truth! And then &s;aid, His Purpo&s;e was to go in|to <HI>Flanders</HI> and into <HI>Spain,</HI> for the obtaining the afore&s;aid Money, and that, <HI>Ralegh</HI> had appointed to meet him in <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> as he returned home, to be advi|&s;ed of him about the Di&s;tribution of the Money.</Q></P>

Methinks, my Lords, when he accu&s;es a Man, he &s;hould give &s;ome Ac|count and Rea&s;on of it; it is not &s;ufficient to &s;ay, we talked of it.

<P>I am in great Di&s;pute with my &s;elf, to &s;peak in the Ca&s;e of this Gentleman: A former Dearne&s;s between me and him ty'd &s;o firm a Knot of my Conceit of his Virtues, now broken by a Di&s;covery of his Imperfections.

<P>Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> was &s;taid by me at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> upon the fir&s;t News of <HI>Copley,</HI> that the King's Per|&s;on &s;hould be &s;urpriz'd by my Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> and Mr. <HI>George Brook;</HI> when I found <HI>Brook</HI> was in, I &s;u&s;|pected <HI>Cobham,</HI> then I doubted <HI>Ralegh</HI> to be a Par|taker. I &s;peak not this that it &s;hould be thought
<PB N="547" REF="557">
I had greater Judgment than the Re&s;t of my Lords, in making this Ha&s;te to have him examin'd; <HI>Ra|legh</HI> following to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> I met with him upon the Terrace, and willed him, as from the King, to &s;tay, &s;aying, The Lords had &s;omething to &s;ay to him: Then he was examined, but not concerning my Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> but of the &s;urprizing Trea&s;on; my Lord <HI>Grey</HI> was apprehended, and likewi&s;e <HI>Brook;</HI> by <HI>Brook</HI> we found, that he had given Notice to <HI>Cobham</HI> of the &s;urprizing Trea&s;on as he deliver'd it to us, but with as much Sparingne&s;s of a Brother as he might: We &s;ent for my Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> to <HI>Richmond,</HI> where he &s;tood upon his Ju&s;tification, and his Qua|lity; &s;ometimes being froward, he &s;aid he was not bound to &s;ub&s;cribe, wherewith we made the King acquainted. <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;aid, if my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice would &s;ay it were a Contempt, he would &s;ub&s;cribe; whereof being re&s;olved, he &s;ub&s;cribed.

<P>1. <HI>Ralegh</HI> prote&s;teth again&s;t the &s;ur|prizing Trea&s;on. 2. That he knew not of the Matter touching <HI>Arabella.</HI> I would not charge you Sir <HI>Walter</HI> with a Matter of Fal&s;hood: You

<P>Then it was but lawful Su&s;picion. But to that whereas you &s;aid, That <HI>Cobham</HI> had accu&s;ed you on Pa&s;&s;ion, I an&s;wer three Ways. 1. I ob|&s;erv'd when <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;aid, Let me &s;ee the Letter a|gain, he pau&s;ed, and when he did &s;ee that Count <HI>Aremberg</HI> was touch'd, he cry'd out, <HI>O Traytor! O Villain! now will I confe&s;s the whole Truth.</HI> 2. The Accu&s;ation of a Man on Hear &s;ay, is nothing: Would he accu&s;e him&s;elf on Pa&s;&s;ion, and ruinate his Cau&s;e and Po&s;terity, out of Malice to accu&s;e you? 3. Could this be out of Pa&s;&s;ion? Mark the Manner of it: <HI>Cobham</HI> had told this at lea&s;t two Months before to his Brother <HI>Brook, You are Fools, you are on the Bye,</HI> Ralegh <HI>and I are on the Main, we mean to take away the King and his Cubs;</HI> this he deliver'd two Months before. So mark the Manner and the Matter; he would not turn the Weapon again&s;t his own Brother, and accu&s;e him|&s;elf to accu&s;e you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralegh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hath <HI>Cobham</HI> confe&s;&s;ed that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Chief Ju&s;tice.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is &s;poken by Mr. <HI>Attor|ney,</HI> to prove that <HI>Cobham</HI>'s Speech came not out of Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralegh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it be proved that <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;aid &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Attorney.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Cobham</HI> &s;aith, he was a long Time doubt|ful of <HI>Ralegh,</HI> that he would &s;end him and the Money to the King. Did <HI>Cobham</HI> fear le&s;t you would betray him in <HI>Jer&s;ey?</HI> Then of Nece&s;&s;ity there mu&s;t be Tru&s;t between you. No Man can betray a Man, but he that is tru&s;ted, in my Under&s;tanding. This is the greate&s;t Argument to prove, that he was ac|quainted with <HI>Cobham</HI>'s Proceedings. <HI>Ralegh</HI> hath a deeper Reach than to make him&s;elf, as he &s;aid, <HI>Robin Hood,</HI> a <HI>Ket,</HI> or <HI>Cade;</HI> yet I never heard
<PB N="549" REF="559">
that <HI>Robin Hood</HI> was a Traytor; they &s;ay he was an Outlaw. And whereas he &s;aith, that our King is not only more wealthy and potent than his Prede|dece&s;&s;ors, but al&s;o more politick and wi&s;e, &s;o that he could have no Hope to prevail: I an&s;wer, there is no King &s;o potent, wi&s;e, and active, but he may be overtaken through Trea&s;on. Whereas you &s;ay, <HI>Spain</HI> is &s;o poor; di&s;cour&s;ing &s;o largely thereof, it had been better for you to have kept in <HI>Guiana,</HI> than to have been &s;o well acquainted with the State of <HI>Spain.</HI> Be&s;ides, if you could have brought <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> to have joined, you might have had Hope to prevail. For his &s;ix Overthrows, I an&s;wer, he hath the more Malice, becau&s;e Repul&s;es breed De&s;ire of Revenge. Then you &s;ay, you never talk'd with <HI>Cobham</HI> but about Lea&s;es, and letting Lands, and ordering his Hou&s;e; I never knew you Clerk of the Kitchen, &amp;c. If you had fallen on your Knees at fir&s;t, and confe&s;&s;ed the Trea&s;on, it had been better for you. You &s;ay, he meant to have given me a Cabinet of thirty Pounds; perhaps he thought by tho&s;e Means, to have anticipated me therewith. But you &s;ay, all the&s;e are Circum&s;tances. I an&s;wer, all this Accu&s;ation in Circum&s;tance is true: Here now I might appeal to my Lords, that you take hold of this, that he &s;ub&s;cribed not to the Accu&s;ation.</P>

A Judge condemned a Woman in <HI>Sarum,</HI> for killing her Hu&s;band, on the Te&s;timony of one Witne&s;s; afterwards his Man confe&s;&s;ed the Murder, when &s;he was executed.

<P>It may be an Error in me, and if tho&s;e Laws be repeal'd, yet I hope the Equity of tho&s;e Laws remains &s;till; but if you affirm it, it mu&s;t be a Law to Po&s;terity; the Proof of the common Law is by Witne&s;s and Jury; let <HI>Cobham</HI> be here, let him &s;peak it: Call my Accu&s;er before my Face, and I have done.</P>

<P>Now I come to prove the Circum|&s;tances of the Accu&s;ation to be true. <HI>Cobham</HI> con|fe&s;&s;ed he had a Pa&s;port to travel, hereby intending to pre&s;ent Overtures to the Arch-duke, and from thence to go to <HI>Spain,</HI> and there to have Conference with the King for Money: You &s;ay, he promi&s;ed to come home by <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> to make merry with you and your Wife.</P>

<P>Further, in his Examination, he &s;aith, Nothing could be &s;et down for the Di&s;tribution of the Money to the Di&s;contented, without Conference with <HI>Ralegh.</HI> You &s;aid, it &s;hould have been for Procurement of Peace, but it was for rai&s;ing Rebel|lion. Further, <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;aith, He would never have entred into the&s;e Cour&s;es, but by your In&s;tigation, and that you would never let him alone. Your Scholar was not apt enough to tell us all the Plots; that is enough for you to do, that are his Ma&s;ter: You intended to tru&s;t Sir <HI>Arthur Savage,</HI> whom I

<P>All this is but one Accu&s;ation of <HI>Cob|ham</HI>'s, I hear no other Thing; to which Accu&s;a|tion he never &s;ub&s;cribed, nor avouched it. I be|&s;eech you, my Lords, let <HI>Cobham</HI> be &s;ent for, charge him on his Soul, on his Allegiance to the King: if he affirm it, I am guilty.</P>

<P>I hope to make this &s;o clear, as that the Wit of Man &s;hall have no Colour to an|&s;wer it. The Matter is Trea&s;on in the highe&s;t Degree, the End to deprive the King of his Crown. The particular Trea&s;ons are the&s;e: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To rai&s;e up Rebellion; and, to effect that, to procure Mo|ney, to rai&s;e up Tumults in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by divulging a trea&s;onable Book again&s;t the King's Right to the Crown; the Purpo&s;e, to take the Life of his Ma|je&s;ty and his I&s;&s;ue. My Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> confe&s;&s;eth Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> to be guilty of all the&s;e Trea&s;ons. The Que&s;tion is, Whether he be guilty as joining with him, or in&s;tigating of him? The Cour&s;e to prove this, was by my Lord <HI>Cobham</HI>'s Accu&s;ation. If that be true, he is guilty; if not, he is clear. So whether <HI>Cobham</HI> &s;ay true, or <HI>Ralegh?</HI> That is the Que&s;tion. <HI>Ralegh</HI> hath no An&s;wer, but the Sha|dow of as much Wit, as the Wit of Man can de|vi&s;e. He u&s;eth his bare Denial; the Denial of a Defendant mu&s;t not move the Jury. In the <HI>Star-Chamber,</HI> or in the <HI>Chancery,</HI> for Matter of Title, if the Defendant be called in Que&s;tion, his Denial on his Oath is no Evidence to the Court to clear him, he doth it in <HI>propria Cau&s;a.</HI> Therefore much le&s;s in Matters of Trea&s;on. <HI>Cobham</HI>'s Te&s;ti&s;ication again&s;t him before then, and &s;ince, hath been largely di&s;cour&s;ed.</P>

Now, Sir, you &s;hall &s;ee whether you had Intelligence with <HI>Cobham</HI> with|in four Days before he came to the <HI>Tower.</HI> If he be wholly <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> that de&s;ired a Pen&s;ion of 1500 Pounds a Year from <HI>Spain,</HI> that <HI>Spain</HI> by him might have Intelligence, then <HI>Ralegh</HI> is a Traytor.

<P>I have thought it fit, to &s;et down this to my Lords, wherein I profe&s;s on my Soul, to write nothing but the Truth. I am come new near to the Period of my Time, therefore I confe&s;s the Truth before God, and his Angels. <HI>Ralegh,</HI> four Days before I came to the <HI>Tower,</HI> cau&s;ed an Apple <HI>(Eve's Apple)</HI> to be thrown in at my Chamber window; the Effect of it was to intreat me to right the Wrong that I had done him, in &s;aying, That I &s;hould have come home by <HI>Jer&s;ey;</HI> which under my Hand to him. I have retracted. His fir&s;t Letter I an&s;wered not, which was thrown in the &s;ame Manner, wherein he prayed me to write him a Letter, which I did. He &s;ent me Word, that the Judges were at Mr. <HI>Attorney</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and that there was good Hope the Proceedings again&s;t us &s;hould be &s;taid; he &s;ent me another Time a little Tobacco. At <HI>Aremberg</HI>'s coming, <HI>Ralegh</HI> dealt with me, to procure him a Pen&s;ion of <HI>1500</HI> Pounds a Year, for which he promi&s;ed that no Action &s;hould be again&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> but he would give Knowledge before-hand.

<P>I had thought I &s;hould never have &s;een this Day, to have &s;tood in this Place, to give Sentence of Death again&s;t you; becau&s;e I thought it impo&s;&s;ible, that one of &s;o great Parts &s;hould have fallen &s;o grievou&s;ly.

It is be&s;t for Man not to &s;eek to climb too high, le&s;t he fall; nor yet to creep too low, le&s;t he be trodden on. It was the Po&s;ie of the wi&s;e&s;t and greate&s;t Coun&s;ellor of his Time, in <HI>Eng|land, In medio &s;patio mediocria firma locantur.</HI> You might have lived well with 3000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, for &s;o I have heard your Revenues to be. I know nothing might move you to be di&s;contented; but, if you had been down, you know Fortune's Wheel, when it is turned about, ri&s;eth again. I never heard, that the King took away any Thing from you, but the Cap|tain&s;hip of the Guard, which he did with good Rea|&s;ons, to have one of his own Knowledge, whom he might tru&s;t in that Place. You have been taken for a wi&s;e Man, and &s;o have &s;hewed Wit enough this Day. Again, for Monopolies for Wine, &amp;c. If the King &s;aid, <HI>It is a Matter that offends my People, &s;hould I burthen them for your particular good?</HI> I think, you could not well take it hardly, that his Subjects were ea&s;ed, tho' by your private Hindrance. Two Vices have lodged chiefly in you; one is an eager Ambition; the other corrupt Covetou&s;ne&s;s. Ambition, in de&s;iring to be advan|ced to equal Grace and Favour, as you have been before time; that Grace you had then, you got

not in a Day or Year. For your Covetou&s;ne&s;s, I am &s;orry to hear that a Gentleman of your Wealth &s;hould become a ba&s;e Spy for the Enemy, which is the vile&s;t of all other; wherein, on my Con&s;cience, <HI>Cobham</HI> hath &s;aid true: By it you would have in|crea&s;ed your Living 1500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year. This Co|vetou&s;ne&s;s is like a Canker, that eats the Iron-place where it lives. Your Ca&s;e being thus, let it not grieve you, if I &s;peak a little out of Zeal, and Love, to your Good. You have been taxed by the World, with the Defence of mo&s;t heatheni&s;h and bla&s;phemous Opinions, which I li&s;t not to re|peat, becau&s;e Chri&s;tian Ears cannot endure to hear them, nor the Authors and Maintainers of them be &s;uffered to live in any Chri&s;tian Common-wealth. You know what Men &s;aid of <HI>Harpool.</HI> You &s;hall do well before you go out of the World, to give Sa|tisfaction therein, and not to die with the&s;e Impu|tations on you. Let not any Devil per&s;uade you to think, there is no Eternity in Heaven; if you think thus, you &s;hall find Eternity in Hell-fire. In the fir&s;t Accu&s;ation of my Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> I ob&s;erv|ed his Manner of &s;peaking: I prote&s;t before the Living God, I am per&s;uaded he &s;poke nothing but the Truth. You wrote, that he &s;hould not in any Ca&s;e confe&s;s any Thing to a Preacher, telling him an Example of my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> that noble Earl that is gone; who, if he had not been carried away with others, had lived in Honour to this Day among us. He confe&s;&s;ed his Offences, and obtain|ed Mercy of the Lord; for I am verily per&s;uaded in my Heart, he died a worthy Servant of God. Your Conceit of not confe&s;&s;ing any Thing, is very inhuman and wicked. In this World is the Time of confe&s;&s;ing, that we may be ab&s;olved at the Day of Judgment. You have &s;hewed a fearful Sign of denying God, in advi&s;ing a Man not to confe&s;s. It now comes in my Mind, why you may not have
<PB N="576" REF="586">
your Accu&s;er Face to Face; for &s;uch a one is ea&s;ily brought to retract, when he &s;eeth there is no Hope of his own Life. It is dangerous that any Traytors &s;hould have any Accefs one to another, or Confe|rence; when they &s;ee them&s;elves mu&s;t die, they will think it be&s;t to &s;ee their Fellow live, that he may commit the like Trea&s;on again, and &s;o in &s;ome Sort &s;eek Revenge.</P>
<P>Now it re&s;teth to pronounce the Judgment, which I wi&s;h you had not been this Day to have received of me: For, if the Fear of God in you had been an&s;werable to your other great Parts, you might have lived to have been a &s;ingular good Subject. I never &s;aw the like Trial, and I hope, I &s;hall never &s;ee the like again.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> JUDGMENT</HEAD>
<P>But &s;ince you have been found guilty of the&s;e horrible Trea&s;ons, the Judgment of the Court is, that you &s;hall be had from hence to the Place whence you came, there to remain until the Day of Execution; and from thence you &s;hall be drawn upon a Hurdle through the open Streets to the Place of Execution, there to be hanged and cut down alive, and your Body &s;hall be opened, your Heart and Bowels plucked out, and your Privy-Members cut off and thrown into the Fire, before your Eyes; then your Head to be &s;trucken off from your Body, which &s;hall be divided into four Quarters, to be di&s;po&s;ed of at the King's Plea&s;ure: And God have Mercy upon your Soul.</P>
