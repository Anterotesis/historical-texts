<HEAD>THE SPEECH OF R. B. SHERIDAN, E^S^Q^. ON SUMMING UP THE SECOND CHARGE AGAINST WARREN HASTINGS, ESQ. BEFORE THE HIGH COURT OF PARLIAMENT, IN <HI>WESTMINSTER-HALL,</HI> TUESDAY, JUNE 2, 1788.</HEAD>
<P>THE general expectation from the Speech of Mr. Sheridan, on &s;umming up the &s;econd Charge again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings, though exceeding all that has been recently witne&s;&s;ed on &s;imilar occa&s;ions, was fully apparent in the brilliancy and fullne&s;s of the Court this day. Before ten o'clock the Galleries for Peers' Tickets, and the Peere&s;&s;es' Box were crouded to an overflow. In the &s;eats for the Commons, &s;o generally de&s;erted, there appeared upwards of three hundred Members.&mdash;Tho&s;e in fact who did not then &s;ee the Court, can &s;carcely form a judgment of the <HI>&s;pectacle.</HI>&mdash;To enumerate tho&s;e of di&s;tinction who were pre&s;ent, would be to enumerate all who are con&s;picuous for Rank, or claim celebrity from Talents.&mdash;That mind, however, mu&s;t be in&s;en&s;ible to excellence, on which the &s;plendor of the &s;cene could make a more than tran&s;ient impre&s;&s;ion; the expectation was rai&s;ed to an higher object; and could the faint &s;ketches of the Memory communicate but a remote &s;emblance of the reality, we would a&s;&s;ert to ab&s;ent Readers, with more Confidence, that no degree of expectation was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed ungra|tified.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">
The Court being &s;eated, preci&s;ely at 12 o'clock, Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> aro&s;e.&mdash;It would be &s;uperfluous, he ob&s;erved, for him to call the attention of their Lord&s;hips to the magnitude and importance of the &s;ubject before them; to advert to the parties who were engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s; or to depict the &s;ituation of tho&s;e multitudes who were ultimately to be affected. All this had already been done by the Hon. Gentleman (Mr. Burke) who opened the Pro&s;ecution;&mdash;by him, who, alone, was equal to the ta&s;k;&mdash;by him, to whom Mankind was in|debted for the embodied &s;tand, which was now made in defence of the general rights of Humanity.&mdash;Neither was it his intention to enter into any de|tail, which might be deemed foreign to the que&s;tion immediately before the Court:&mdash;he would only indulge him&s;elf in a few words re|&s;pecting &s;ome in&s;inuations which had been thrown out again&s;t the per&s;ons concerned in this pro&s;ecu|tion. It had been whi&s;pered, by whom he could not &s;ay, that there was &s;omething malicious, and &s;omething perhaps too violent in the manner in which it had been conducted. Speaking for him|&s;elf, and as far as the heart of man could be known, for the other Managers appointed by the Commons, he would boldly a&s;&s;ert, that they had acted &s;olely from conviction;&mdash;not a convic|tion born in Error, and nur&s;ed by Prejudice; but a Conviction founded on deliberate and well grounded enquiry;&mdash;that they had proceeded, not as rejoicing in Puni&s;hment, but impel|ed by a &s;anguine hope of Remedy.&mdash;Per|&s;onal malice! God forbid that they &s;hould in|dulge &s;uch a &s;en&s;ation again&s;t the unfortunate gen|tleman at the bar; but how, when they were to &s;peak of Rapine, of Cruelty, and of Extortion, could &s;uch ideas be conveyed but in con&s;onant lan|guage? There was undoubtedly a difference be|tween Impeachment for capital Crimes, and tho&s;e for Mi&s;demeanours only. In proceedings on the mer, every latitude had been indulged by u&s;age, every aggravation was employed, and every act of the Pri&s;oner tortured into Criminality. No &s;uch privilege was claimed by the Managers on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; but yet it &s;hould be con&s;i|dered by tho&s;e, who&s;e Pity &s;eemed to ri&s;e in pro|portion with the Guilt of its object;&mdash;that if &s;uch a mode of Proceeding was admi&s;&s;ible in the former Ca&s;e, where the life of the Pri&s;oner was affected, it was &s;till more ju&s;tifiable on an Impeachment like the pre&s;ent; where the utmo&s;t Con&s;equences of Guilt when proved, would be but a <HI>&s;plendid exclu&s;ion</HI> of the Criminal from that Society which he had injured, or a <HI>trifling deduction</HI> from the &s;poils of a long-continued Extortion.</P>
<P>It had been ob&s;erved, what was undoubtedly true, that no complaint, from the Natives of India, had been pre&s;ented in the cour&s;e of the&s;e proceedings. Tho&s;e, however, who were fir&s;t to make this ob&s;ervation, were fully convinced that meek|ne&s;s in &s;uffering was there a part of the na|tional Character, and that their terrors had been too deeply impre&s;&s;ed, not to be long remembered. But though a De&s;pair of Briti&s;h Ju&s;tice had pre|vailed through that Penin&s;ula;&mdash;though their &s;ub|dued hearts could not even hope for relief&mdash;yet their Claims, on the Ju&s;tice and Humanity of their Lord&s;hips were not thereby dimini&s;hed, but recom|mended. He would not mention this De&s;pair, without accompanying the ob&s;ervation by proof; he therefore read Extracts from two letters, the fir&s;t, lately received from Lord <HI>Cornwallis;</HI> the &s;e|cond, enclo&s;ed from Capt. Kirkpatrick to his Lord|&s;hip: from both which it appeared, that &s;uch was the prevailing &s;en&s;e through India, of the Injuries inflicted by the Engli&s;h, and of their repeated violations of every Compact, that it would be long indeed before their Confidence, in Engli&s;h Faith, or their reliance on Engli&s;h Ju&s;tice, could again be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>To the&s;e complaints their Lord&s;hips were now to an&s;wer not by profe&s;&s;ions, but by facts;&mdash;not by remedial acts directed to the future, but by an exemplary puni&s;hment inflicted on pa&s;t delinqen|cy.
<PB N="3" REF="4">
It was incumbent on them to &s;hew to the oppre&s;&s;ed natives of India, and to future Gover|nors and Judges, that there could be no autho|rity &s;o high, no office &s;o &s;acred, as not to be &s;ubject to the paramount power of Briti&s;h Ju&s;|tice.&mdash;He did not, however, mean to &s;ay that the the Example &s;hould be made unle&s;s the Guilt was fir&s;t fully proved; no, God forbid, that in this free and ju&s;t land, legal proof and legal guilt &s;hould ever be &s;eparated.&mdash;Tho' the greater part of the Evidence on this occa|&s;ion had been, with a few exceptions, wrung from the unrelenting accomplices of the Pri&s;oner&mdash;from men who had partook of the &s;poils, and were involved in the Guilt; yet had he therefore no Indulgence to demand, nor had he to reque&s;t that the Court &s;hould take that as evidence on this occa&s;ion which on any other they might deem them&s;elves bound to refu&s;e. He on the contrary, was now to bring forward to their Lord&s;hips a Ma&s;s of Evidence, as full, as &s;trong, as compe|tent, and as conclu&s;ive, as ever e&s;tabli&s;hed the guilt of a Criminal, or ever brought conviction home to the brea&s;ts of con&s;cientious Judges.&mdash;In the performance of this ta&s;k, he ob&s;erved, he &s;hould have the le&s;s difficulty, as their Lord&s;hips had attended to the whole, voluminous and com|plicated as it appeared, with a diligence which did honor to their feelings, and &s;hewed their indivi|dual &s;en&s;e of the dignity of that high Tribunal, which they collectively formed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of this Evidence, to which he &s;hould call the attention of the Court, was the Defences delivered in by Mr. Ha&s;tings to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and to their Lord&s;hips.&mdash;On the&s;e, as being the voluntary admi&s;&s;ions of the Pri&s;oner, unextorted by any threat, and unbia&s;&s;ed by any per&s;ua&s;ion, much &s;tre&s;s had undoubtedly been laid. To a part of the&s;e, however, an ob|jection had been made, the mo&s;t extraordinary perhaps that had ever been advanced in a Court of Criminal Ju&s;tice;&mdash;an objection which, when Mr. Ha&s;tings was well advi&s;ed, as he undoubted was; when he was &s;aved from his own <HI>ra&s;h Gui+ance,</HI> the Managers could &s;carcely have expected. This objection was, that a Part of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> defence in particular, not having been written by Mr. Ha&s;tings, but by &s;ome of his friends, that Gentle|man was not bound by any admi&s;&s;ions therein con|tained. Mr. Ha&s;tings, on appearing at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Commons, had pleaded the ha&s;te in which he had written in palliation of his inac|curacies; he had even made a merit of doing that him&s;elf, which would be le&s;s dangerous, if he had committed it to another!&mdash;But now, &s;aid Mr. Sheridan, that he finds that there is &s;omething more than inaccuracy&mdash;&s;omething fraught with that actual danger which he had apprehended;&mdash;he re|verts to that plea which he had abandoned, and de|clares that he had committed the tru&s;t to others!&mdash;He di&s;claims all his former merits, and avers that in making up his tale, he had not tru&s;ted &s;olely to his own powers;&mdash;that he had put his <HI>Memory</HI> in|to <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>parcelled</HI> out his <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> in|to different departments. The &s;tructure, it ap|peared, went on, whil&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings was con|tent with over&s;eeing and cheering his labourers.&mdash;Mr. Shore, &s;aid he, you will take care to make me appear a good <HI>financier;</HI> Major Scott, my <HI>Judgment</HI> is repo&s;ed in your hands;&mdash;Mr. <HI>Middle|ton</HI> my HUMANITY is yours!!!&mdash;The work be|ing thus done,&mdash;Mr. Ha&s;tings &s;urveyed it with a carele&s;s glance, and adopted it as his own. But now that its defects appear, the Child of his Adop|tion becomes the object of his aver&s;ion, his appro|bation cea&s;es, and his language is totally changed.&mdash;The defence is in general made up of general denials of the Charges, intermixed with encomi|ums on his own conduct:&mdash;yet Mr. Ha&s;ting ex|claims&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Subject me to all the other evidence again&s;t me;&mdash;I know I can tru&s;t to their want of Recollection and their force of Attachment;&mdash;bare my bo&s;om to every &s;haft of Enmity:&mdash;but &s;ave me from the <HI>Perils</HI> of my own <HI>Panegyric!</HI>"</Q>&mdash;The <HI>ha&s;te</HI> in which the&s;e productions were writ|ten,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
was al&s;o alledged by Mr. Ha&s;tings as an apology for every error; but did it follow, that becau&s;e a man wrote rapidly, he &s;hould al&s;o write fal&s;ely; or was it that the truth and candour of Mr. Ha&s;tings were &s;o deeply buried in his bo&s;om that long &s;tudy alone could bring them upwards, whil&s;t the natural fal&s;hood, floating on the &s;urface, could be transferred with extemporaneous readi|ne&s;s to every topic, whether to be written or to be uttered!&mdash;The&s;e were the apologies offered for the variations, the admi&s;&s;ions, and the incon|&s;i&s;tency of Mr. Ha&s;tings' defences; but the&s;e it was to be hoped, for the &s;ake of propriety and good &s;en&s;e, would never again be repeated.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, on quitting this &s;ubject, entered into a very full and happy delineation of the &s;ituation of the Prince&s;&s;es of <HI>Oude.</HI> No peru&s;al of the Turki&s;h Hi&s;tory, he ob&s;erved, nor attention to the precepts of the Mahometan religion, could give their Lord&s;hips any idea of the manners of the women of high <HI>ca&s;ts</HI> in Hindo&s;tan. Educated in a pro|found re&s;pect to the cu&s;toms of their Per&s;ian ance&s;tors, theo maintained a purer &s;tyle of Preiudice, and a loftier degree of Super&s;tition; dwelling perpetually within the precincts of their Zenanas, the Simplicity of their &s;entiments was equalled only by the Purity of their Conduct. In tho&s;e innocent retreats, they were circum&s;cribed, not immured; for &s;uch was the force of Prejudice, that Liberty would be looked on as a cur&s;e to tho&s;e, to whom the com|mon gaze of men, would be regarded as an unex|piable violation. However mi&s;taken their ideas, they were placed there by the hand of Piety, and could not be di&s;turbed, but by a &s;acrilege. They were as Relics on an Altar, which though de|po&s;ited by Super&s;tition, none but the impious would di&s;turb.</P>
<P>In addition to tho&s;e claims, Mr. Ha&s;tings him|&s;elf had borne te&s;timony to the Duty which Chil|dren owed to Parents in Hindo&s;tan. Yet the Bhow Begum, or mother of the reigning Nabob, had &s;till &s;tronger demands on the affection of her &s;on.&mdash;In the year 1764, when <HI>Sujah Dowlah,</HI> after the Battle of Buxar, was driven from that terri|tory by the Engli&s;h, which their politic Genero|&s;ity afterwards re&s;tored; &s;he bore her private trea&s;ures to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and was rewarded by the re&s;pectful attachment of his future life, with the devi&s;e of all his territories to her &s;on.&mdash;She had al&s;o interfered in a quarrel between her &s;on and her hu&s;band, and when the &s;avage fa|ther was about to &s;trike down his &s;on with a &s;abre, at the expence of her blood, pre&s;erved that life which &s;he gave.&mdash;There were pleas in her favor, which would have exacted the reverence of any man&mdash;<HI>but one!</HI>&mdash;But the&s;e pleas, the &s;ex, the age, and character of the Begums;&mdash;and what was yet more, the death-bed recommendation of Sujah Dowlah, were all of no weight with Mr. Ha&s;tings.&mdash;This was therefore the object of the pre&s;ent charge;&mdash;that where he owed protection&mdash;he had been the &s;evere&s;t op|pre&s;&s;or;&mdash;that the weakne&s;s which &s;hould have claimed his aid, but excited his violence;&mdash;that he had &s;ubjected the &s;on, thus to make him the un|gracious in&s;trument of his tyranny over the pa|rent&mdash;and had fir&s;t made him a <HI>&s;lave,</HI> in order that he might become&mdash;a <HI>mon&s;ter!</HI></P>
<P>The interference of Mr. <HI>Bri&s;tow</HI> in 1775, in the differences between the Begums and the Na|bob, in con&s;equence of the claims of the latter, was the next ground of Mr. SHERIDAN's ob&s;er|vations.&mdash;Mr. Bri&s;tow had then, in a conver&s;ation with the Superior or Elder Begum, thrown out an in&s;inuation, that the trea&s;ures which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were the Trea&s;ures of the State,&mdash;and on this in|&s;inuation, &s;o termed by Mr. Bri&s;tow him&s;elf, had Mr. Ha&s;tings founded all his arguments on that head, and on which he lately appeared to place &s;o much reliance.&mdash;The Begums at that time gave up to the <HI>A&s;oph ul Dowla</HI> &s;ums amounting to Five Hundred and Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds.&mdash;Of this a part was to be paid in goods, which as they con|&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="5" REF="6">
of arms, elephants, &amp;c. the Nabob al|ledged to be his property, and refu&s;ed to accept as payment. This occa&s;ioned a di&s;pute which was referred to the Board of <HI>Calcutta.</HI> Mr. Ha&s;tings then vindicated the right of the Begums to all the goods in the Zenana, and brought over the Majority of the Council to his opinion. The ideas then placed on record, he had &s;ince found it convenient to di&s;own, as belonging not to him but to the Majority of the Council!&mdash;How the&s;e opinions could be transferred, it might be difficult for their Lord&s;hips, though well informed of the effects of <HI>Majorities</HI> and <HI>Minorities</HI> to determine. As well might Mr. BURKE, on a future day de|liver an Encomium on that <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good</HI> man, Mr. <HI>Ha&s;tings!</HI> and if reminded of his &s;hare in the pro|&s;ecution, alledge, that he was not accountable for &s;o <HI>nefarious</HI> a preceeding; that his opinions when once delivered, were no longer his own, that at the time, he had con&s;tantly acted in a <HI>Minority!</HI></P>
<P>The claims however, it was ob&s;ervable, of the Nabob, as to the Trea&s;ure of the Begums, were at this time the only plea alledged for the &s;eizure. The&s;e were always founded on a pa&s;&s;age of that <HI>Koran</HI> which was perpetually quoted but never proved.&mdash;Not a word was then mentioned of the &s;trange Rebellion which was afterwards conjured up, and of which the <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> and the <HI>notoriety</HI> were equally a &s;ecret!&mdash;A Di&s;affection which was at its height, at the very time, when the Begums were di&s;pen&s;ing their liberality to the Nabob, and exerci&s;ing the greate&s;t genero&s;ity to the Engli&s;h Officers in di&s;tre&s;s!&mdash;a Di&s;turbance, in &s;hort, without its parallel in Hi&s;tory, which was rai&s;ed by two <HI>Women,</HI>&mdash;carried on by two <HI>Eunuchs,</HI>&mdash;and finally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by an <HI>Affidavit!</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan then adverted to the Negociations of Mr. Middleton with the Begums in 1778, when the di&s;contents of the Superior Begum would have induced her to leave the Country, unle&s;s her au|thority was &s;anctioned and her property &s;ecured by the Guarantee of the Company.&mdash;This Guarantee the Coun&s;el&mdash;or Mr. Ha&s;tings, had thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to deny, as knowing that if the agreements with the Elder Begum were proved, it would affix to Mr. Ha&s;tings the Guilt of all the &s;ufferings of the Women of the Khord Mahal, the Revenues for who&s;e &s;upport were &s;ecured by the &s;ame engage|ment. In treating this part of the &s;ubject, the prin|cipal difficulty aro&s;e from the <HI>uncertain</HI> evidence of Mr. Middleton, who tho' concerned in the nego|ciation of <HI>four</HI> treaties, could not recollect affix|ing his &s;ignature to <HI>three</HI> out of that number. Mr. Sheridan proved however, from the Evidence even of Mr. Middleton, that a Treaty had been &s;igned in October, 1778, wherein the rights of the Elder Begum were fully recognized; a Pro|vi&s;ion &s;ecured for the Women and Children of the late Vizier in the Khord Mahal; and that the&s;e engagements had received the fulle&s;t &s;anction of Mr. Ha&s;tings. The&s;e facts were confirmed by the Evidence of Mr. Purling, a Gentleman, who, Mr. Sheridan &s;aid, had delivered him&s;elf fairly and as having no <HI>foul &s;ecrets</HI> to conceal. He had tran&s;mitted Copies of the&s;e engagements in 1780 to Mr. Ha&s;tings at Calcutta; the an&s;wer returned was, that in arranging the Taxes on the other Di&s;tricts, he &s;hould pa&s;s over the Jaghires of the Begums. No notice was then taken of any im|propriety in the tran&s;actions in 1778, nor any no|tice given of an intended revocation of tho&s;e en|gagements.</P>
<P>But in June 1781, when Gen. Clavering and Col. Mon&s;on, being no more, and Mr. Francis having returned to Europe, all the <HI>hoard</HI> and <HI>arrear</HI> of collected Evil bur&s;t forth without re|&s;traint, and Mr. Ha&s;tings determined on his Journey to the Upper Provinces;&mdash;it was then, that, without adverting to intermediate tran&s;ac|tions, he met with the Nabob A&s;oph ul Dowlah, at Chunar, and received from him the my&s;terious pre&s;ent of 100,000l. To form a proper idea
<PB N="6" REF="7">
of this tran&s;action, it was only nece&s;&s;ary to con|&s;ider the re&s;pective &s;ituation of him who gave, and him who received this pre&s;ent. It was not given by the Nabob from the &s;uperflux of his wealth, nor in the abundance of his e&s;teem for the man to whom it was given. It was on the contrary, a prodigal bounty, drawn from a country depopulated,&mdash;no matter whether by natural cau&s;es, or by the grind|ing of oppre&s;&s;ion. It was rai&s;ed by an exaction, which took what Calamity had &s;pared, and Rapine overlooked;&mdash;and pur&s;ued tho&s;e angry di&s;pen|&s;ations of Providence, when a <HI>prophetic</HI> cha&s;ti&s;e|ment had been inflicted on a <HI>fated</HI> Realm.&mdash;The &s;ecrecy which had marked this tran&s;action, was not the &s;malle&s;t proof of its criminality.&mdash;When <HI>Benaram Pundit</HI> had, a &s;hort time before, made a pre&s;ent to the Company of a lack of Ru|pees, Mr. Ha&s;tings, in his own language, deemed it <Q REND="inline">"worthy the prai&s;e of being recorded;"</Q> But in this in&s;tance, when ten times that &s;um was given, neither Mr. Middleton nor the Council were acquainted with the tran&s;action, until Mr. Ha&s;tings, four months after felt him&s;elf compelled to write an account to England, and the Intelli|gence returned thus circuitou&s;ly to his friends in India! It was peculiarly ob&s;ervable in this tran&s;|action how much the <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> of the different par|ties were at variance. Mr. Ha&s;tings travels to the Nabob, to &s;ee, no doubt, and enquire into his <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> but immediately takes for him 130,000l. to be applied to the nece&s;&s;ities of the <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ed</HI> Ea&s;t India Company; but on farther delibera|tion, the&s;e con&s;iderations vani&s;h; a <HI>third</HI> object ari&s;es more worthy than either of the former, and the money is taken from the one, and demanded from the other to be applied to the u&s;e of&mdash;the <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ed</HI> Mr. Ha&s;tings.</P>
<P>The Money, it was alledged by Mr. Ha&s;tings, had been originally taken to di&s;charge the arrear of the Army. It had not been applied to that u&s;e, becau&s;e it was received in Bills on Gopal Dos, a rich Banker, of Benares, who was then kept a pri&s;oner by Cheit Sing.&mdash;Major Scott being que&s;|tioned on the &s;ubject, declared that Bills on Gopal Dos were as good as Ca&s;h, for that though the Principal of the Hou&s;e was a Pri&s;oner, that cir|cum&s;tance made no difference what&s;oever with the other partners. Thus Mr. Ha&s;tings was incon|&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, by alledging an objection which &s;hould have prevented his taking the Money in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, for the purpo&s;e he had &s;tated; and Major Scott contradicting Mr. Ha&s;tings, removed the objection, and re&s;tored the bu&s;ine&s;s to its original footing.&mdash;But through all tho&s;e windings of my&s;terious Hypocri&s;y, and of artificial Concealment, it was ea&s;y to mark the &s;en&s;e of hidden Guilt. Mr. Ha&s;tings him&s;elf being driven from every other hold, advanced the &s;tate plea of <HI>State Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> But of this ne|ce&s;&s;ity he had brought no proof; it was a nece&s;&s;ity which li&s;tened to whi&s;pers for the purpo&s;e of crimi|nation, and dealt in rumour to prove its own ex|i&s;tence.&mdash;To a General leading the Armies of Britain:&mdash;to an Admiral bearing her thunders over the &s;eas, the plea of Nece&s;&s;ity might be indulged, if the wants of tho&s;e were to be &s;upplied who&s;e blood had been &s;pilt in the &s;ervice of their Coun|try; but then like the imperial Eagle de&s;cending from its ne&s;t, though it de&s;olated the &s;kirts of the rock, the Motive and the Conduct would be equally con&s;picuous. No concealment would then be nece&s;&s;ary, and they would di&s;dain the veil which covered the dark, mean arts of bu&s;y Peculation.</P>
<P>On the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Treaty of Chunar, which &s;ucceeded the acceptance of this bribe, Mr. Sheri|dan was equally per&s;picuous and equally &s;evere. It was a proceeding, he ob&s;erved, which, as it had its beginning in corruption, had its continuance in fraud, and its end in violence. The fir&s;t pro|po&s;ition of the Nabob after his recent liberality, was, that the Army &s;hould be removed, and all the Engli&s;h recalled from his dominions. The Bribe which he had given was the obvious price of

their removal. He felt the weight of their op|pre&s;&s;ion;&mdash;he knew to &s;peak his own language&mdash;"that when the Engli&s;h &s;taid, they &s;taid, to wing to watch the fir&s;t <HI>buddings</HI> of its Pro&s;perity, and to nip every every promi&s;e of future luxuri|ance.</P>
<P>To this demand Mr. Ha&s;tings had promi&s;ed to accede, and to recal every Engli&s;hman from the Province; but by an eva&s;ion which Mr. Middle|ton di&s;clo&s;ed with &s;o much difficulty to their Lord&s;hips on the la&s;t day of his appearrnce, had &s;haken the Tree until nothing remained upon its <HI>leafle&s;s</HI> Branches, yet a new flight was on the a&s;k for &s;omething." Though their Predece&s;&s;ors had exhau&s;ted the Revenue;&mdash;though they the promi&s;e was virtually recalled. No <HI>Order</HI> were afterwards given for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Engli&s;hmen in the Province, but <HI>Recommenda|tions</HI> of the &s;ame effect with Mr. Middleton, and the Vizier were &s;ent, and the practice con|inued.&mdash;In the agreement re&s;pecting the Re|&s;umption of the Jaghires, the Nabob had been duped by a &s;imilar deception. He had demanded and obtained leave to re&s;ume tho&s;e of certain in|dividuals: Mr. Ha&s;tings however defeated the permi&s;&s;ion by making the order general; know|ng that there were &s;ome favourites of the Nabobs whom he could be by no means brought to di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s.&mdash;Such was the Conduct of Mr. Ha&s;tings, not in the moment of cold or crafty Policy, but in the hour of Confidence and the efferve&s;cence of his gratitude for the &s;avour he had ju&s;t received. Soaring above every common feeling, he could deceive the Man to who&s;e liberality he &s;tood in debted&mdash;even his <HI>Gratitude</HI> was <HI>perilous</HI>&mdash;and a <HI>danger</HI> actually awaited on the return, which he was to make to an effu&s;ion of Genero&s;ity!</P>
<P>The tran&s;actions in which Sir <HI>Elijah Impey</HI> bore a &s;hare, and the tenor of his Evidence, were the next objects of Mr. Sheridan's Animadver&s;ion.&mdash;The late Chief Ju&s;tice of Bengal, he remarked, had repeatedly &s;tated, that Mr. Ha&s;tings left Cal|cutta, with <HI>two</HI> Re&s;ources in his view,&mdash;tho&s;e of <HI>Benares</HI> and of <HI>Oude.</HI> It appeared, however, from every circum&s;tances, that the latter re&s;ource was never in his contemplation, until the in&s;ur|rections in Benares, terminating in the Capture of Bedjeygur had de&s;troyed all his hopes in that Pro|vince. At that in&s;tant, the mind of Mr. Ha&s;t|ings, fertile in re&s;ources, fixed it&s;elf on the Trea|&s;ures of the Begums, and Sir Elijah Impey was di&s;patched to collect materials for their crimina|tion: <Q REND="inline">"But I have ever thought,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Sheridan, <Q REND="inline">"the &s;election of &s;uch a Per&s;onage, for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, one of the greate&s;t aggra|vations of the guilt of Mr. Ha&s;tings."</Q>&mdash;That he, the purity of who&s;e Character &s;hould have influenced his conduct, even in his mo&s;t dome&s;tic retirements;&mdash;that he, who, if con|&s;ulting the Dignity of Briti&s;h Ju&s;tice, &s;hould have remained as &s;tationary as his Court in Calcutta;&mdash;that &s;uch a man &s;hould be called to travel 500 miles for the tran&s;action of &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s, was a deviation without a plea, and a degradation with|out Example.&mdash;This, however, was in &s;ome de|gree, a Que&s;tion to be ab&s;tracted for the con&s;i|deration of tho&s;e, who adorned and illumined the &s;eats of Ju&s;tice in Britain, and the purity of who&s;e Character precluded the nece&s;&s;ity of any further ob&s;ervations on &s;o different a Conduct.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the manner in which Sir Elijah Impey had delivered his evidence, it required &s;ome ob&s;ervation, though made without imputing to that gentleman the &s;malle&s;t culpability. Sir Elijah had admitted, that in giving his evidence he had never an&s;wered without looking equally to the probability and the con&s;equences of the fact in que&s;tion. Sometimes he had even admitted cir|cum&s;tances of which he had no recollection beyond the mere probability that they had taken place. By con&s;ulting in this manner what was <HI>probable,</HI> and the contrary, he might certainly have corrected and
<PB N="8" REF="9">
his memory at times, and Mr. Sheridan &s;aid he would accept that mode of giving his te&s;timony' provided that the inver&s;e of the propo&s;ition might al&s;o have place, and that where a circum&s;tance was <HI>improbable,</HI> a &s;imilar degree of Credit might be &s;ubtracted from the Te&s;timony of the Witne&s;s. <HI>Five</HI> times in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and <HI>twice</HI> in that Court, for in&s;tance, had Sir Elijah Impey&punc; borne te&s;timony, that a Rebellion was raging at Fyzabad, at the time of his Journey to Lucknow. Yet on the <HI>eighth</HI> examination, he had contra|dicted all the former, and declared, that what he meant was that the Rebellion <HI>had</HI> been raging, and the country was then in &s;ome degree re&s;tored to quiet.&mdash;The Rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for the former Er|rors were, that he had forgotten a letter received from Mr. Ha&s;tings, informing him that the Re|bellion was quelled, and that he had al&s;o forgot|ten his own Propo&s;ition of travelling through Fy|zabad to Lucknow. With re&s;pect to the letter, nothing could be &s;aid, as it was not in evidence; but the other ob&s;ervation would &s;carcely be admit|ted, when it was recollected that in the Hou&s;e of Commons, Sir Elijah Impey had declared that it was his propo&s;al to travel through Fyzabad, which had originally brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">orth the Information that the way was ob&s;tructed by the Rebellion!&mdash;From this information Sir Elijah Impey had gone by the way of Illyabad,&mdash;but what was yet more &s;ingular, was, that on his return he would again have returned by the way of Fyzabad, if he had not been again informed of the danger;&mdash;&s;o that had it not been for the&s;e friendly informations, the Chief Ju&s;tice would have run plump into the very <HI>focus</HI> of the Rebellion!&mdash;There were two circum&s;tances, however worthy of remark;&mdash;the <HI>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t</HI> was, that Sir <HI>Elijah Impey</HI> &s;hould, when charged with &s;o dangerous a Commi&s;&s;ion as that of procuring Evidence, to prove that the <HI>Begums</HI> had meditated the Expul&s;ion of their &s;on from the Throne, and of the Engli&s;h from Bengal, &s;hould twice intend to pa&s;s through the City of their Re&s;idence; and that he, as he alledged, from mere motives of &s;choolboy curio&s;ity &s;hould choo&s;e the <HI>primro&s;e</HI> path&mdash;and wi&s;h, when engaged in &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s, to loiter in the way, and idle in the &s;un-&s;hine.&mdash;The &s;econd circum&s;tance worthy of ob&s;ervation, was, that if a conclu&s;ion could be made from a cloud of circum&s;tances, the inference on this occa&s;ion would undoubtedly be, that Sir Elijah Impey was di&s;&s;uaded by Mr. Ha&s;tings and Mr. Middleton from pa&s;&s;ing by the way of Fyzabad, as well knowing, that if, as a friend to Mr. Ha&s;tings, he were to approach the Begums, he would be convinced, by his reception, that nothing could be more foreign from the truth than the idea of their &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;affection&mdash;It was al&s;o ob&s;ervable, that Sir Elijah Impey, at Luck|now, taking evidence in the face of day in &s;up|port of this Charge of Rebellion again&s;t the Begums, when conver&s;ing with the Nabob and his Mini&s;ter, heard not a &s;ingle word from either of a Rebellion, by which it was propo&s;ed to de|throne the Nabob, and to change the Government of his dominions!&mdash;And equally unaccountable it appeared, that Sir Elijah Impey, who had advi&s;ed the taking of tho&s;e affidavits for the &s;afety of Mr. Ha&s;tings, had never read them at the time, for the purpo&s;e of &s;eeing whether they were &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e, or the contrary!&mdash;After &s;o long a re&s;erve, however, and after declaring on oath that he thought it unnece&s;&s;ary, the next &s;tep taken by Sir Elijah Impey, was to read the affida|vits, as however late, they might contribute &s;omething to his information. He had been led to this &s;tudy, by his own allegation, from having been mi&s;led by Mr. SHERIDAN, one of the Managers on the part of the Commons, who by looking at a book which he held in his hand, had per|&s;uaded him to declare that a &s;worn interpreter was pre&s;ent on the receiving of tho&s;e affidavits; that Major Davy was pre&s;ent for that purpo&s;e&mdash;and that whoever it was, he was perfectly &s;atisfied with his conduct on the occa&s;ion; when it was actually in evidence that that no Interpreter what&s;oever was pre&s;ent.&mdash;Now, &s;aid Mr. Sheridan, how I,
<PB N="9" REF="10">
by merely looking into a book, could <HI>intimate</HI> the pre&s;ence of an Interpreter, could <HI>inculcate</HI> the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Major Davy, and could al&s;o <HI>look</HI> the &s;atisfaction conceived by Sir Elijah Impey, are que&s;tions which I believe that Gentleman alone is able to determine!</P>
<P>He &s;hould admit, however, he &s;aid, that Sir Elijah Impey had not &s;trictly attended to for us on the occa&s;ion of taking tho&s;e Affidavits; that he had merely directed the Bible to be given to the Whites, and the Koran to the Blacks, and had packed up in his Wallet the returns of both without any further enquiry; or that he had glanced over them in India, having previou&s;ly cut off all communication between his <HI>eye</HI> and his <HI>mind,</HI> &s;o that no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s was transferred from the former to the latter; and that he had read them in England, if po&s;&s;ible with le&s;s infor|mation:&mdash;however &s;trange the&s;e circum&s;tances might be, he would admit them all;&mdash;he would even admit, that the Affidavits were legally and properly taken&mdash;and yet would prove, that tho&s;e Affidavits were not &s;ufficient to &s;u&s;tain any one point of Criminality again&s;t tho&s;e who were the &s;ubjects of the pre&s;ent Charge.</P>
<P>After &s;ome brief ob&s;ervations on &s;ome parts of the Affidavits, particularly on tho&s;e of a Native Officer, who, as Mr. Sheridan ob&s;erved, gave a &s;pecimen of <HI>Platoon firing</HI> in his Evidence, by giv|ing three Affidavits in one Day; he concluded with ob&s;erving, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> as it would tend very much to abbreviate the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Charge, to enter more largely into the tendency of tho&s;e Affidavits; he &s;hould therefore make a pau&s;e for the pre&s;ent, and take the liberty of calling the at|tention of their Lord&s;hips more particularly to this point on an en&s;uing Day.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan &s;poke for four hours and a half. Nothing could be more perfect than his delivery; but that, at &s;ome di&s;tant intervals, the exce&s;s of his feelings, occa&s;ioned him to be le&s;s di&s;tinctly heard than u&s;ual.&mdash;At half pa&s;t four o'clock, the Court adjourned.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>FRIDAY, JUNE 6, 1788.</HEAD>
<P>The Court being &s;eated at half pa&s;t twelve, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> re&s;umed his &s;peech, by expre&s;&s;ing his &s;atisfaction, that in the interval of the Adjournment, the remaining part of the Evidence, &amp;c. had been printed, and laid be|fore their Lord&s;hips; as it was the wi&s;h of the Ma|nagers that every document &s;hould be before the Court at the time, for the purpo&s;e of determining with more accuracy, whether they had or had not borne out the Charges which they pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Recurring, then, to the Affidavits taken by Sir Elijah Impey at Lucknow, they formed, he ob&s;erved, a material article in the Defence of Mr. Ha&s;tings; and on the deci&s;ion of their Lord&s;hips re&s;pecting the weight of the allegations which they contained, a greater part of this que&s;tion would finally depend.&mdash;With re&s;pect to one part of Charge made on the Begums&mdash;their having &s;hewn an uniform &s;pirit of ho&s;tility to the Briti&s;h Go|vernment, it had not only failed, but was ab&s;o|lutely abandoned by the Coun&s;el for the Pri&s;oner, as not being &s;upported by a tittle of Evidence. In deciding on the other parts of this Charge, their having committed an overt act of Rebellion&mdash;their having inflamed the Jaghirdars,&mdash;and excited the Di&s;contents in Oude, their Lord&s;hips were to con&s;ider the &s;ituation in which Mr. Ha&s;tings &s;tood at the time when the&s;e Charges were made.&mdash;Hav|ing failed in his attempt at Benares, his mind was entirely directed to the Trea&s;ures of the Begums. He knew that &s;uch was the &s;ituation into which he had plunged the affairs of the Company, that he knew he could not addre&s;s his <HI>venal</HI> Ma&s;ters, un|le&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="11">
&s;ome mea&s;ure was found. He had therefore &s;tood forward as an Accu&s;er, where he was al&s;o to pre&s;ide as a Judge;&mdash;and with much caution &s;hould that Judge be heard, who has apparently a profit on the conviction, and an intere&s;t in the condem|nation of the party to be tried. He would not from this, infer however, that the charge was groundle&s;s;&mdash;but he would argue, that until fully proved, it &s;hould not meet with implicit credit.&mdash;It was obvious al&s;o that the attempt &s;aid to have been made by the Begums to dethrone the Nabob and extirpate the Engli&s;h, was in the highe&s;t de|gree improbable;&mdash;but he would not infer from thence, that it was impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;There is in human nature a perver&s;e propen&s;ity to evil, which had &s;ometimes cau&s;ed the perpetration of bad acts with|out any obvious gratification re&s;ulting to the Perpe|trator. All he &s;hould claim, therefore was, that the accu&s;ations brought by Mr. Ha&s;tings again&s;t the Begums, &s;hould undergo a candid examination, and that probable evidence, at lea&s;t, &s;hould be brought to the &s;upport of charges in them&s;elves improbable.</P>
<P>Mr. Ha&s;tings in his defence had complained, that his Pro&s;ecutor had attempted to blacken the&s;e affidavits as ra&s;h, irregular, and irrelevant; when they had been authenticated by the pre&s;ence of Sir Elijah Impey, and as he al&s;o ob&s;erved, being taken in an enquiry, directed &s;olely to e&s;tabli&s;h the guilt of <HI>Cheit Sing,</HI> they were merely an acce&s;|&s;ary evidence in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, and were there|fore le&s;s liable to &s;u&s;picion. The Rea&s;oning in this la&s;t in&s;tance, Mr. Sheridan ob&s;erved, would undoubtedly be good; but that the a&s;&s;ertion that the enquiries were exclu&s;ively directed to the Crimination of Cheit Sing, had been proved an ab&s;olute fal&s;ehood; as they were really intended to ju&s;tify what was after|wards to be done. With re&s;pect to the epithets be&s;towed on tho&s;e Affidavits by his Hon. Friend, the truth would be&s;t appear, from a Review of their Contents.&mdash;Mr. Sheridan then proceeded to remark on the Affidavits &s;everally, as far as they related to Charges again&s;t the Begums. Tho&s;e of the <HI>Jemmadars,</HI> or native Subaltern Officers, con|tained nothing it appeared, but vague rumour and improbable &s;urmi&s;e.&mdash;Hyder Beg Cawn, the Mini&s;ter of the Nabob, though &s;wearing both to Rumour and to Fact, could mention no particulars of an In&s;urrection which was to have dethroned his Sovereign. Nor was the Evidence of Col. Han|nay and the other Engli&s;h Officers more conclu&s;ive: loud &s;u&s;picions appeared to have been propagated at a time of general di&s;turbance, and when the flames of War were raging in the neighbouring province of <HI>Benares.</HI> Mr. Middleton, though &s;wearing after he had received his final orders from Mr. Ha&s;tings re&s;pecting the &s;eizure of the Trea|&s;ures, could only &s;ay&mdash;that he believed the Be|gums had given countenance to the rebels, and as he had heard, &s;ome aid.&mdash;The whole of the de|po&s;itions, Mr. Sheridan ob&s;erved, were &s;o futile, that were they defended in an inferior Court of Ju&s;tice, he was convinced that he &s;hould be for|bidden to reply, and told that was combating with that, which was nothing!</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t part of the Charge, the <HI>Rebellion</HI> of the Begums, he had examined with all the painful re&s;earch of an Antiquary, but could find no trace of any &s;uch tran&s;action. No blow was &s;truck&mdash;no march was made again&s;t the con|cealed Enemy; but the Rebellion, though com|menced for a mo&s;t unnatural purpo&s;e, was &s;uffered to die a natural Death!&mdash;The Coun&s;el had thought proper to dwell for a time, on the Nabob going to Fyzabad, on his return from Chunar, attended by a guard of 2000 men. Mr. Middleton being a&s;ked, whether the&s;e men were well-appointed, though on another occa&s;ion, he had declared him|&s;elf no military man, caught in the in&s;tant at <HI>gleam</HI> of <HI>martial memory,</HI> and an&s;wered in the affirmative. The contrary, however, was proved by the evidence of Capt. Edwards, who attended the Nabob as his Aid-de-Camp, and al&s;o that
<PB N="11" REF="12">
tho&s;e troops were actually mutinous for their pay, who were then taken to &s;top the progre&s;s of di&s;|affection! Yet he would agree to all that the Coun&s;el required;&mdash;he would &s;uffer the whole 2000 men to enter full trot into the City of Fyza|bad; for Capt. Edwards had fully proved, that it was merely the <HI>u&s;ual guard</HI> of the Nabob.&mdash;It would therefore have been di&s;re&s;pectful to have gone with le&s;s attendance; he could have no mo|tive for going <HI>incog,</HI> unle&s;s he might have in|tended to make him&s;elf a perfect match for the in&s;urrection which was al&s;o <HI>incog.</HI> or thought that a <HI>rebellion,</HI> without an <HI>army,</HI> would be mo&s;t pro|perly &s;ubdued by a <HI>Prince</HI> without a <HI>Guard.</HI></P>
<P>Another &s;uppo&s;ed proof of the di&s;affection of the Begums was brought, by alledging that 1000 <HI>Nudgics</HI> had been rai&s;ed at Fyzabad, and &s;ent to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Cheit Sing, and this for no other rea&s;on than a detachment of the &s;ame number was in the li&s;t of the forces of that Rajah! This &s;ingle circum&s;tance was taken as a full and compleat evidence of the identity of tho&s;e troops. It was no matter that the Officer &s;econd in com|mand with Cheit Sing, had &s;worn that the detach|ment came from Lucknow, and not from Fyza|bad.&mdash;This Mr. Ha&s;tings would have to be a tri|&s;ling mi&s;take, of one Capital for another!&mdash;The &s;ame Officer however had al&s;o depo&s;ed, that the troops were of a different de&s;cription; tho&s;e of Begum being &s;word&s;men, and tho&s;e in the &s;ervice of the Rajah, match-lock men.&mdash;The inference to be made therefore, undoubtedly was, that the de|tachment did actually come from Lucknow; not &s;ent perhaps by the Nabob, but by &s;ome of the Jaghirdars, his favorites, who had abundant pow|er for that purpo&s;e, and who&s;e aver&s;ion to the En|gli&s;h had always been avowed.&mdash;The name of Sa|dib Ally, his half-brother, had been mentioned as being highly criminal in the&s;e tran&s;actions;&mdash;but to the que&s;tion, why he was not puni&s;hed, Sir Elijah Impey had given the be&s;t an&s;wer at that Bar;&mdash;by informing their Lord&s;hips that Sadib Ally was mi&s;erably poor? He had therefore found protection in his <HI>po|verty,</HI> and &s;afety in his <HI>In&s;olvency.</HI> Every com|mon maxim of judging on &s;uch occa&s;ions, was cer|tain to be overturned by Mr. Ha&s;tings;&mdash;it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed that the needy were the mo&s;t daring, and that Nece&s;&s;ity was the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">mulus</HI> to Innovation. But the Governor General invert|ing this propo&s;ition, had laid it down as an axiom&mdash;that the actions of the poor were &s;ufficiently pu|ni&s;hed by contempt&mdash;that the Guilt of an offender &s;hould increa&s;e in a preci&s;e <HI>ratio</HI> with his Wealth&mdash;and that in fine, where there was no <HI>trea&s;ure,</HI> there could undoubtedly be no <HI>trea&s;on!</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan next read the letter of the Begum to Mr. Ha&s;tings, complaining of the &s;u&s;picions which had been &s;o unju&s;tly rai&s;ed of her conduct; and referring to Capt. Gordon who could te&s;tify her innocence. He al&s;o read the letter of Capt. Gor|don to the Begum, thanking her for her inter|ference, and acknowledging that he owed his life to her bounty. It had been a&s;ked with an air of &s;ome triumph, why Capt. Gordon was not called to that Bar? He had an&s;wered then as now that he would not call on a man, who, in his affidavit, had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all mention of this important tran&s;ac|tion. He tru&s;ted, that if ever he &s;aw him at that bar, he &s;hould witne&s;s a contrite zeal to do away the effects of that &s;ilence, and behold a peniten|tial tear for the part he had then taken. He hoped, however, for the honor of human nature, that Capt. Gordon was then under a delu&s;ion&mdash;and that he was led on by Mr. Middleton, who was well informed of the bu&s;ine&s;s, to act a part o which he did not know the con&s;equences. Every feeling of humanity recoiled from the Tran&s;action taken in any other point of view. It was difficult to imagine that any man could &s;ay to a Benefactor, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The breath that I now draw, next to heaven I owe to you;&mdash;my exi&s;tence is an emanation from your bounty&mdash;I am indebted to you be|yond
<PB N="12" REF="13">
all po&s;&s;ibility of return, and therefore,&mdash;my GRATITUDE &s;hall be your DESTRUC|TION."</Q></P>
<P>The original letters on this occa&s;ion from Co|lonel Hannay and Captain Gordon to the Begum, had been tran&s;mitted by her through Major Gil|pin to Mr. Middleton, for the purpo&s;e of being &s;hewn to Mr. Ha&s;tings; but the leaves were torn from Mr. Middleton's letter-book in the place where hey &s;hould have appeared. When examined on this &s;ubject, he &s;aid, that he had depo&s;ited Per&s;ian copies of tho&s;e letters in the office at Lucknow, but that he did not bring tran&s;lates with him to Calcutta&mdash;becau&s;e he left Lucknow the very day after he had received the originals. This ex|cu&s;e, Mr. Sheridan &s;aid, he could boldly a&s;&s;ert, was a <HI>flat and decided perjury!</HI> It could be proved, by corre&s;ponding dates, that Middleton had received tho&s;e letters at lea&s;t a month before he left Lucknow. He departed from that City on the 17th of October, but mu&s;t have received tho&s;e letters before the 20th of the preceding Month. He was therefore well aware of the purity of tho&s;e, in who&s;e oppre&s;&s;ion he was engaged; he knew that their attachment was fully proved, at the very time when they were charged with di&s;af|fection; but as their puni&s;hment was predetermin|ed, he in concert with his Principal, found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;uppre&s;s the te&s;timonials of their In|nocence.&mdash;This Ma&s;s of Fraud and Cruelty, co|vered as it had been by every art which the vile Agents could devi&s;e, was now bared to the View, by the aid of that Power who can give a <HI>Giant's nerve</HI> even to an <HI>Infant Arm.</HI>&mdash;The injured &s;uf|ferers, with tears more powerful than Argument, and with &s;ighs more impre&s;&s;ive than Eloquence, &s;upplicated their Lord&s;hips' Ju&s;tice, and called for that retribution which &s;hould take place on the de|te&s;ted, but unrepenting Author of their wrongs!</P>
<P>The benevolent interference of the Begum, in favor of Capt. Gordon, had been a&s;&s;igned by Mr. Ha&s;tings in his Defence, to her intelligence of the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Engli&s;h at that period.&mdash;That this allegation was founded in manife&s;t fal&s;ehood, could very ea&s;ily be proved.&mdash;The only &s;ucce&s;s which the Briti&s;h forces at that time met with, was that of Col. Blair, on the 3d of September, but where he him&s;elf acknowledged that another victory, gained at &s;uch a lo&s;s, would be equal to a de|feat.&mdash;The reports &s;pread around the country, at the time, were of the mo&s;t unfavorable ca&s;t&mdash;that Mr. Ha&s;tings had been &s;lain at Be|nares, and that the Engli&s;h were every where routed:&mdash;The&s;e reports, it was to be remarked, were of infinitely more con&s;equence to the pre&s;ent argument, than the facts which really occurred; but if any doubt remained on the mind of any man, it was only nece&s;&s;ary to recur to a never|failing evidence, in that of Mr. Ha&s;tings again&s;t him&s;elf.&mdash;In a letter to the Council, which was on record, Mr. Ha&s;tings acknowledged that from the 22d of Augu&s;t to the 22d of Sept. which included ofcour&s;e the time of Captain Gordon's liberation, he had been confined in a &s;ituation of the utmo&s;t hazard; that his &s;afety, during that time, was extremely precarious, and that the affairs of the Engli&s;h were generally thought to be unfavorable in the extreme! In his defence, however, the&s;e admi&s;&s;ions were totally forgotten; there was al&s;o an ob&s;ervable incon&s;i&s;tency in what was there al|ledged: that Colonel Hannay had written to the Begum in the &s;tyle of &s;upplication&mdash;becau&s;e, in the de&s;perate &s;ituation of affairs, he knew of no other which he could adopt; and yet, in the &s;ame &s;en|tence it was averred, that the Begums had procured the relea&s;e of Captain Gordon&mdash;from her know|ledge of the pro&s;perous advances of our army!&mdash;It appeared, therefore, beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, that tho&s;e Prince&s;&s;es had demon&s;trated the firmne&s;s of their attachment to the Engli&s;h, not in the moment of &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;not from the impul&s;e of fear, nor from the pro&s;pect of future protection;&mdash;but at a time when the hoard of collected ven|geance
<PB N="13" REF="14">
was about to bur&s;t over our heads; when the mea&s;ure of <HI>European</HI> guilt in <HI>India,</HI> appeared to be completely filled, by the oppre&s;&s;ions which had ju&s;t then been exerci&s;ed on the unfortunate Cheit Sing; and when Offended Heaven &s;eemed to interfere, to change the meek di&s;po&s;ition of the Natives, to awaken their Re&s;entments, and to in|&s;pirit their Revenge!</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd,</HI> of the remaining parts of the Charge again&s;t the Begums, was their having en|flamed the <HI>Jaghirdars.</HI> It was evident, how|ever, even from the letters of Mr. Middleton him&s;elf, that no &s;uch aid was wanted to a|waken re&s;entments, which mu&s;t unavoidably have ari&s;en from the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;There were many powerful Intere&s;ts concerned;&mdash;the Jaghires, which were depending were of a va&s;t amount, and as their owners by the Re&s;ump|tion would be reduced at once to poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, their own feelings were &s;ufficient to pro|duce every effect which had been de&s;cribed. It was idle, therefore, to a&s;cribe to the Begums, without a &s;hadow of proof, the in&s;piring of &s;enti|ments, which mu&s;t have exi&s;ted without their in|terference. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall not wa&s;te the time of the Court, &s;aid Mr. Sheridan, on &s;uch a &s;ubject, but appeal to your Lord&s;hips individually, to deter|mine whether on a propo&s;al being made to con|fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">cate your &s;everal e&s;tates,&mdash;and the magnitude of the objects are not very unequal,&mdash;the interference of any two Ladies in this Kingdom would be at all nece&s;&s;ary to awaken your Re&s;entments, and to rou&s;e you to oppo&s;ition, &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>The Di&s;contents which prevailed in the Province of Oude, had been al&s;o and with &s;imilar ju&s;tice attributed to the&s;e Prince&s;&s;es, and formed the <HI>third</HI> and la&s;t Article of Charge again&s;t them. But the Conduct of the Officers re&s;iding in that Province, the repeated complaints from the Natives, and the acknowledged rapacity of Col. Hannay left no difficulty in tracing tho&s;e di&s;contents to the &s;ource where they had originated. The Nabob him&s;elf was &s;o well convinced of the tyranny of Col. Han|nay, that on a propo&s;ition coming from Mr. Ha&s;t|ings, to &s;end him back into the Province, the Nabob &s;wore by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"that if the Colonel was &s;ent back, he would quit the Province, and come to re&s;ide with Mr. Ha&s;tings."</Q> The Gover|nor General &s;ome time after &s;ent an apology for the &s;ugge&s;tion, but it was then too late&mdash;Col. Hannay was dead&mdash;and the Province was de&s;olate! If a Stranger ju&s;t arrived, and ignorant of every former tran&s;action were then to &s;urvey the once fer|tile plains of Oude, he would a&s;k,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What &s;a|vage <HI>Invader</HI> had waged &s;uch terrible Ho&s;tilities again&s;t the bounties of Heaven and the works of Man?"</Q> What <HI>Civil Fury,</HI> or what <HI>Religious Frenzy</HI> had depopulated the &s;cene, even to a Wa&s;te of De&s;olation? What pernicious <HI>Mon&s;ter,</HI> &s;ent by vindictive Heaven, had &s;wept through its plains, and with pe&s;tiferous breath, bla&s;ted all it could not con&s;ume?&mdash;To the&s;e que&s;tions &s;ome native with a tearful eye, and &s;ubdued a&s;pect, would have an&s;wered&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"that no War, no Di&s;&s;entions, no Mon&s;ter had produced tho&s;e effects, which were all owing&mdash;to an <HI>alliance</HI> with the <HI>Egli&s;h!</HI>&mdash;and that this <HI>di&s;a&s;trous connection</HI> had been fraught with more ills, than the mo&s;t incenced enemy could de&s;ire, or a merciful Providence de&s;cend to inflict!"</Q></P>
<P>That this repre&s;entation was not exaggerated, would appear from the de&s;cription of Maj. Nay|lor, who had &s;ucceeded Colonel Hannay, and who had previou&s;ly &s;aved him from the vengeance which the a&s;&s;embled <HI>ryots,</HI> of hu&s;bandmen, were about to take on their oppre&s;&s;or. The progre&s;s of extortion, it appeared, had not been uniform in that province:&mdash;it had ab&s;olutely increa&s;ed as its re&s;ources failed, and as the labor of exaction became more difficult, the <HI>price</HI> of that encrea&s;ed <HI>labor</HI> had been charged as an additionl tax on the wretched inhabitants!&mdash;At length, even in their meek bo&s;oms, where <HI>injury</HI> never before begot

<HI>re&s;entment,</HI> nor <HI>de&s;pair</HI> arou&s;ed to <HI>courage,</HI> en|crea&s;ed oppre&s;&s;ion had its due effect. They a&s;&s;embled round their Oppre&s;&s;or, and had nearly made him their &s;acrifice. So deeply were they im|pre&s;&s;ed with the &s;en&s;e of their wrongs, that they would not accept of even life from tho&s;e who had re&s;cued Col. Hannay! They pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the &s;words of the &s;oldiery, and as they lay bleeding on the banks of their &s;acred &s;tream, they comforted them&s;elves with the gha&s;tly hopes that their blood would not de&s;cend into the &s;oil; but that it would a&s;cend to the view of the GOD of NATURE, and there claim a retribution for their wrongs!&mdash;Of a people thus injured, and thus feeling, it was an audacious fallacy to attribute the conduct to any external impul&s;e.&mdash;That GOD, who~ gave them the <HI>Form</HI> of Man, implanted al&s;o the wi&s;h to vindicate the <HI>Rights</HI> of Man. Tho' &s;imple in their manners, they were not &s;o uninformed as not to know&mdash;that Power is in every State a tru&s;t repo&s;ed for the general good; and that the tru&s;t being once abu&s;ed, &s;hould of cour&s;e be in&s;tantly re&s;umed.</P>
<P>Though the Innocence of the Begums, Mr. Sheridan continued, was thus proved beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, it could not but be allowed that he argued fairly, if he did not immediately infer, from that proof, the guilt of Mr. Ha&s;tings. He would go &s;o far as to admit, that Mr. Ha&s;tings might have been deluded by his Accomplices, and have been per&s;uaded into a conviction of a criminality which did not exi&s;t; if that were proved, he would readily agree to acquit the Pri|&s;oner of the pre&s;ent Charge. But if, on the con|trary, there appeared, in his &s;ub&s;equent conduct, uch a concealment, as denoted the fulle&s;t con|ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt; if all his narrations of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s were marked with incon&s;i&s;tency and contradic|tion, that mind mu&s;t be inacce&s;&s;ible to conviction, which could entertain a doubt of his criminality.&mdash;From the month of Sept. in which the &s;eizure of the Trea&s;ures took place, until the January fol|lowing, had Mr. Ha&s;tings wholly concealed the tran&s;action from the Council at Calcutta! If any thing could be more &s;ingular than this con|cealment, it was the rea&s;ons by which it was after|wards attempted to be ju&s;tified. Mr. Ha&s;ting's fir&s;t pleaded a <HI>want</HI> of <HI>lei&s;ure.</HI> He was writing to the Council, at a time when he complained of an ab&s;olute inaction:&mdash;he found time to narrate &s;ome pretty Ea&s;tern tales, re&s;pecting the attach|ment of the Seapoys to their <HI>cannon,</HI> and their dre&s;|&s;ing them with flowers on particular occa&s;ions&mdash;but of a Rebellion which convul&s;ed an Em|pire&mdash;of the &s;eizure of the Trea&s;ures to &s;uch an amount, he could not find lei&s;ure to &s;ay one &s;yllable until he had &s;ecured an Excu&s;e for his Conduct in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Money!&mdash;The &s;econd Excu&s;e was, that all Communication was cut off with Fyzabad; and this was alledged at the time, when letters were pa&s;&s;ing daily between him and Mr. Middleton, and when Sir Elijah Impey had pronounced the Road to be as free from interruption, as that between London and Brentford.&mdash;The third Excu&s;e was, that Mr. Middleton had taken with him on his departure from Chunar all the original papers which it was nece&s;&s;ary for Mr. Ha&s;tings to con&s;ult!&mdash;That the original papers had not been removed, was evident, however, from Mr. Ha&s;tings &s;ending a copy of the Treaty of Chunar to Mr. Middleton on the fourth day after the Re&s;ident's departure; though it appeared that it was after to be rein|clo&s;ed at a proper time to Mr. Ha&s;tings, to be &s;hewn to the Council. A Copy of the &s;ame had been &s;hewn to the <HI>Oriental</HI> GROTIUS, Sir Elijah Impey, which he confe&s;&s;ed his having read at the time when he declared his ignorance, of the guarantee granted to the Prince&s;&s;es of Oude! Looking to the ab&s;urdity of rea&s;ons, &s;uch as the&s;e a&s;&s;igned in Defence of a &s;ilence &s;o criminal; Mr. Sheridan declared, that he would lay a&s;ide every other arguments&mdash;that he would not dwell on any other topic of guilt; if the Coun&s;el for Mr. Ha&s;tings would but join i&s;&s;ue on this point, and prove, to the &s;atisfaction of the Court, that
<PB N="15" REF="16">
any of the&s;e excu&s;es were in the &s;malle&s;t degree &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e for which they were a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the other artifices of concealment, was a letter from Col. Hannay, dated Oct. 17, 1781, which Mr. Sheridan proved beyond di&s;pute, could not have been written at the time, but was fabri|cated at a &s;ub&s;equent period, as it contained a mention of facts, which could by no po&s;&s;ibility have been known to Col. Hannay, at the time when it was pretended to have been written.&mdash;Whatever el&s;e could be done for the purpo&s;e of concealment, was done in that mixture of canting and my&s;tery, of rhap&s;ody, and enigma&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mr. Ha&s;tings' Narrative of his journey to Benares."</Q>&mdash;He there &s;et out with a &s;olemn appeal to heaven for the truth of his averments, and a declaration of the &s;ame purport to Mr. Wheeler: the faith, however, thus pledged, was broken both to God and man, for it was already in evidence, that no &s;ingle tran&s;action had occurred as it was there &s;tated!</P>
<P>The que&s;tion would undoubtedly occur to every per&s;on who had attended to the&s;e proceedings&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why Mr. Ha&s;tings had u&s;ed all the&s;e efforts to veil the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s in my&s;tery?</Q>&mdash;It was not &s;trictly incumbent on him to an&s;wer the que&s;tion, yet he would reply, that Mr. Ha&s;tings had obviou&s;ly a <HI>bloody</HI> rea&s;on for the concealment.&mdash;He had looked to the natural effect of &s;trong injuries on the human mind; as in the ca&s;e of Cheit Sing, he thought that oppre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be|get re&s;i&s;tance; and the efforts which might be made by the Begums in their own Defence, tho' really the <HI>effect,</HI> he was determined to repre|&s;ent as the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of his proceedings.&mdash;Even when di&s;appointed in tho&s;e aims by the natural meekne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e with whom he was to act; he could not abandon the idea,&mdash;and accordingly, in his letter to the Directors, of Jan. 5, 1782, had repre&s;ented the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;tur|bances in Oude, as the po&s;itive cau&s;e of the vio|lent mea&s;ures which he had adopted&mdash;<HI>two months</HI> before tho&s;e di&s;turbances had exi&s;tence!&mdash;He there congratulates his ma&s;ters on the &s;eizure of tho&s;e trea&s;ures, which, by the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> he a&s;|&s;ures them were the property of A&s;ophul Dowla; thus the perturbed &s;pirit of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> law, according to Mr. Ha&s;tings' idea, &s;till hovered round tho&s;e trea&s;ures, and envied them to every po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, until it at length &s;aw them &s;afely lodged within the <HI>&s;anctuary</HI> of the Briti&s;h Trea&s;ury!&mdash;In the &s;ame &s;pirit of piety, Mr. Ha&s;tings had a&s;|&s;ured the Hou&s;e of Commons, that the inhabitants of A&s;ia believed that &s;ome un&s;een power interfer|ed, and conducted all his pur&s;uits to their de&s;tined end.&mdash;That Providence, however, which thus conducted the efforts of Mr. Ha&s;tings, was not the Providence to which others profe&s;s them&s;elves in|debted; which interferes in the cau&s;e of virtue, and in&s;en&s;ibly leads guilt towards its puni&s;hment; it was not in fine that Providence.
<Q>"Who&s;e works are goodne&s;s, and who&s;e ways are right."</Q></P>
<P>The un&s;een power which protected Mr. Ha&s;tings, operated by leading others into crimi|nality, which as far as it re&s;pected the Governor General, was highly fortunate in its effects.&mdash;If the Rajah Nundcomar brings a charge again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings; Providence &s;o orders it, that the Rajah has committed a <HI>Forgery</HI> &s;ome years be|fore, which, with &s;ome <HI>friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> proves a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to remove out of the way &s;o trouble&s;ome an acquaintance.&mdash;If the Com|pany's Affairs are deranged through the want of Money, Providence ordains it &s;o that the Begums, though <HI>uncon&s;ciou&s;ly,</HI> fall into a Re|bellion, and give Mr. Ha&s;tings an opportunity of &s;eizing on their Trea&s;ures! Thus the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of Mr. Ha&s;tings depended not on any po&s;itive merit in him&s;elf; it was to the <HI>in&s;pired</HI> FELONIES, the <HI>heaven-born</HI> CRIMES, and the <HI>providential</HI> TREA|SONS of others that he was indebted for each &s;uc|ce&s;s, and for the whole tenor of his Pro&s;perity!</P>

It mu&s;t undoubtedly bear a &s;trange appearance that a man of reputed Ability &s;hould, even when acting wrongly, have had recour&s;e to &s;o many bungling artifices, and &s;pread &s;o thin a veil over his deceptions. But tho&s;e who te&s;tified any &s;ur|prize at this circum&s;tance, mu&s;t have attended but little to the demeanor of Mr. Ha&s;tings.

<P>It had been a maxim once as much admitted in the practice of common life, as in the &s;chool of philo&s;ophy, that where Heaven was inclined to to de&s;troy the Vice, it began by deba&s;ing the In|tellect. This idea was carried &s;till farther by the Right Hon. Gentleman, Mr. Burke, who opened the pro&s;ecution, who declared that PRUDENCE and VICE were things ab&s;olutely incompatible;&mdash;that the vicious man being deprived of his be&s;t energies, and curtailed in his proportion of un|der&s;tanding, was left with &s;uch a &s;hort-&s;ighted degree of penetration, as could not come under the denomination of PRUDENCE.&mdash;This &s;entiment did honor to the name of his Right Honorable Friend, if that name could now be mentioned with additional ho|nor.&mdash;But it was &s;till to be remembered, that there were other Characters be&s;ide a <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and a <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who acting on determinations inimical to Virtue, and ho&s;tile to the laws of Society, had proceeded, if not with <HI>prudence,</HI> yet with an all|commanding <HI>&s;agacity,</HI> that was productive of &s;imi|lar effects. Tho&s;e, however, were i&s;olated Cha|racters, which left the Vice that dared to follow either in a &s;tate of de&s;pondent Va&s;&s;alage, or involv|ed it in De&s;truction.

<P>After dwelling for &s;ome time time on this topic, with a beauty which we find it impo&s;&s;ible to de|&s;cribe, and with a &s;ublimity which has rarely, if it ever had been equalled:</P>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN reverted again to the &s;ubject of the claims made on the Prince&s;&s;es of Oude.&mdash;Whether tho&s;e were fir&s;t made by the Nabob, or &s;ugge&s;ted to him by his Sovereign, Mr. Ha&s;tings tho' the coun&s;el had laboured much to prove the former appeared to him to carry very little differ|ence.

he broke his Covenant of Exi&s;tence, and violated the Condition by which he held his rank in Socie|ty. If, on the contrary. it was meant as a <HI>Re&s;ump|tion,</HI> in con&s;equence of a &s;uppo&s;ed right in the Na|bob, then Mr. Ha&s;tings &s;hould have recollected the Guarantee of the Company granted to the Begums: unle&s;s it was meant to &s;ay, that Mr. Ha&s;tings act|ed in that, as in other in&s;tances, and a&s;&s;ured them of his Protection,&mdash;until the very moment when it was wanted.&mdash;It was idle, however, to dwell on the conduct or free agency of a man, who, it was notorious, had no will of his own. What Mr. Middleton a&s;&s;erted at that Bar, would &s;carcely be put in competition with a &s;eries of e&s;tabli&s;hed facts; by which it appeared, that the Nabob had &s;ubmitted to every indignity, and yielded to every a&s;&s;umption.&mdash;It was an acknowleged fact, that he had even been brought to join in that paltry artifice which had been termed the &s;ubornation of letters. This practice was carried to &s;uch a length, that he in the end complained, in a manner rather ludicrous, that he was really tired of &s;ending diffe|rent Characters of Mr. Bri&s;tow, in pur&s;uanc of the directions &s;ent to the Re&s;ident.&mdash;He had pronounced black white, and white black &s;o often, that he really knew not what to &s;ay, and therefore begged that once for all, the friends of Mr. Ha&s;tings might be con&s;idered as his, and that their enemies might al&s;o be the &s;ame.&mdash;After this it was &s;uperfluous to argue that the Nabob could direct his view to &s;o important an object as the &s;eizing of the trea&s;ures, unle&s;s he had been impelled by Mr. Middleton, and authori&s;ed by Mr. Ha&s;tings!</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t four o'clock, Mr. SHERIDAN being apparently exhau&s;ted by &s;o very animated a &s;peech of four hours continuance, the Court ad|journed.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>TUESDAY, JUNE 10.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN re&s;umed his &s;peech at the very point where he had concluded on Friday la&s;t. He felt him&s;elf too highly honored, he &s;aid, by the attention which had been paid by their Lord|&s;hips to think any repetition nece&s;&s;ary. He had already proved to every unbia&s;&s;ed mind the va&s;&s;al|lage in which the Nabob of <HI>Oude</HI> was kept by Mr. Ha&s;tings and his agents. He had proved that if ever the Nabob was independent; if ever he was &s;uffered to act from the &s;ugge&s;tions of his own mind, in this bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Begums</HI> he acted under a &s;trong and &s;y&s;tematic compul&s;ion.&mdash;He could al&s;o make it appear to their Lord&s;hips, that this dark and my&s;terious tran&s;action had been conducted by three principals and three &s;ubordi|nates. The principals were Mr. Ha&s;tings, Sir Elijah Impey, and Mr. Middleton; the &s;ubordi|nates, Colonel Hannay, Hyder Beg Cawn, the o&s;ten&s;ible Mini&s;ter of the Nabob, and Ali Abram Cawn, another black agent in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s. By tho&s;e, it would plainly appear, the whole bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted, that the my&s;tery of the conduct could only be equalled by the in|iquity of its conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Before he proceeded however to the main bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the Charge, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to re|mark on two particular circum&s;tances overlooked in his former comments on the evidence.&mdash;The fir&s;t of the&s;e was the pretended ignorance of Sir Elijah Impey, re&s;pecting the &s;ub&s;tance of the Affidavits.&mdash;He had declared that he had no con|ver&s;ation on the &s;ubject with Mr. Ha&s;tings, be|cau&s;e he had left Chunar on the day following their delivery;&mdash;this however would not be looked on as a valid excu&s;e, when it was known that Mr. Ha&s;tings and Sir Elijah Impey left that place together, and travelled in company with each other!&mdash;And what was yet more &s;trange, he pleaded ignorance of the contents of tho&s;e Affi|davits, tho' in &s;ix days after he was found at

Buxar, admini&s;tering an oath to Major Davy, with re&s;pect to the fidelity of his official tran&s;lation of the Affidavits from the Per&s;ian language!&mdash;The &s;econd circum&s;tance which called for notice, was the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the Evidence of Hoolus Roy, the mo&s;t active Agent through the whole of the&s;e tran&s;actions.&mdash;His affidavit was taken with the re&s;t;&mdash;from his &s;ituation, it mu&s;t have contained &s;trong matter either to criminate, or prove the innocence of the Begums&mdash;but by &s;ome &s;trange accident, this &s;trong Affidavit was&mdash;by &s;ome means, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed!</P>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN then adverted at &s;ome length to the contradictory accounts given by Mr. Ha&s;|tings, of the violence u&s;ed towards the Begums, particularly with re&s;pect to the &s;eizure of their Jaghires. That which was undoubtedly an at|trocious violence and unju&s;tifiable fraud, was at one time inflicted as a puni&s;hment for their contumacy;&mdash;at another, the ju&s;tice of the mea|&s;ure was &s;o far a matter of doubt, that even Mr. Ha&s;tings profe&s;&s;ed his readine&s;s to &s;tipulate and to en&s;ure to the Prince&s;&s;es a proper equivalent for tho&s;e Jaghires. The contradictions, however, were not confined to this circum&s;tance; the Na|bob it appeared from the corre&s;pondence, marked as it was by that <HI>knavi&s;h, half-confidence</HI> which was incident to &s;uch tran&s;actions, had offered to &s;ubmit to the &s;eizure of the trea&s;ures, merely as an <HI>alternative</HI> le&s;s dangerous than the re&s;umption of the Jaghires. Much ingenuity was employed to make this appear as the &s;ugge&s;tion of the Na|bob, though it was clearly apparent that it was the propo&s;ition of Mr. Ha&s;tings. An equal in|genuity appeared in Mr. Ha&s;tings's mode of <HI>ac|cepting</HI> an <HI>alternative,</HI> which was, when one conce&s;&s;ion was proffered in lieu of another&mdash;to &s;eize on both!&mdash;The conduct of the Governor General was al&s;o illu&s;trated in a part of his De|fence, where he admitted that there were private rea&s;ons for his conduct towards the Begums&mdash;but which <Q REND="inline">"wanting the authenticity of according evidence,"</Q> he did not chu&s;e at pre&s;ent to bring forward. There was even in this &s;tatement a Mode&s;ty very unu&s;ual with Mr. Ha&s;tings.&mdash;He who in every other in&s;tance advanced A&s;&s;ertions in the room of Proof&mdash;in the pre&s;ent, would not &s;tate any thing which wanted the validity of re|corded Evidence.&mdash;There was, however, &s;uffi|cient to &s;hew, that in addition to the allowed ra|pacity of Mr. Ha&s;tings, there was not wanting the additional incentive of per&s;onal malice!</P>
<P>The Conduct of Mr. Middleton was the next &s;ub|ject of Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.&mdash;His &s;cruples with re&s;pect to the &s;eizure of Jaghires, &s;atisfied at fir&s;t with <Q REND="inline">"a hint,"</Q> but afterwards requiring <Q REND="inline">"a more formal &s;anction;"</Q> the difference between his public and private let|ters, and his offers to change the tenor of the for|mer at the will of the Governor-General; all un|derwent a &s;evere animadver&s;ion. The&s;e ob&s;erva|tions involved of cour&s;e a very complicated detail, which, though nece&s;&s;ary to the ends of ju&s;tice, could, if pur&s;ued by us, afford but little gratifica|tion.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t two o'clock, when Mr. ADAM was reading &s;ome letters of Mr. Middleton and Major Naylor, Mr. Sheridan felt &s;uch an increa&s;ing in|di&s;po&s;ition as compelled him to retire; and &s;hortly after Mr. Fox informed their Lord&s;hips, <Q REND="inline">"that the Hon.

<HEAD>FRIDAY, JUNE 13, 1788.</HEAD>
<P>THE Court, notwith&s;tanding the recent di&s;ap|pointment occa&s;ioned by the illne&s;s of Mr. SHE|RIDAN, was this day as full as ever.&mdash;At Twelve o'Clock, the LORD CHANCELLOR, and the Mover of the pre&s;ent Charge, appeared in their re&s;pective places, and both, we are happy to &s;ay, in a &s;tate of recovered health:&mdash;of the former, we could only judge by his appearance&mdash;Mr. SHE|RIDAN afforded other grounds to form our opi|nion&mdash;an animation which gave force to his &s;ub|limity&mdash;and an energy which &s;pread it&s;elf through his hearers.&mdash;His conclu&s;ion of this day formed a climax of &s;uch excellence, as cannot be de|&s;cribed,&mdash;and which, when fainter impre&s;&s;ions are faded and forgotten, will cau&s;e his hearers to be envied.</P>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN began, by apologizing for the interruption which his Indi&s;po&s;ition had cau&s;ed on the former day. He a&s;&s;ured their Lord&s;hips, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, that nothing but the Import|ance of the Cau&s;e, to which he felt him&s;elf totally unable to do Ju&s;tice, could have made him tre&s;|pa&s;s on that Indulgence, which, on other occa|&s;ions, he had &s;o amply experienced.</P>
<P>He had then concluded, with &s;ubmitting to their Lord&s;hips, the whole of the corre&s;pon|dence, as far as it could be obtained, between the principals and agents, in the nefarious plot carried on again&s;t the Nabob Vizier, and the Begums of Oude. The&s;e letters were worthy the mo&s;t ab&s;tracted attention of their Lord&s;hips, as containing not only a narrative of that foul and unmanly con&s;piracy, but al&s;o a detail of the mo|tives and ends for which it was formed, and an expo&s;ition of the trick, the quibble, the prevari|cation, and the untruth with which it was then acted, and now attempted to be defended!&mdash;The Que&s;tion would undoubtedly &s;ugge&s;t it&s;elf, why the Corre&s;pondence was ever produced by the parties again&s;t whom it was now adduced in evidence, and who had &s;o much rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t the Propriety of their own Conduct?&mdash;To this the an&s;wer was, that it was owing to a mutual and <HI>providential</HI> re&s;entment which had broken out between the Parties, which was generally the Ca&s;e between Per&s;ons concerned in &s;uch tran&s;|actions. Mr. Middleton was incen&s;ed, and felt as a galling triumph the confidence repo&s;ed by the Governor-General in other Agents.&mdash;Mr. Ha&s;t|ings was offended by the <HI>tardy warine&s;s</HI> which marked the Conduct of Middleton; by the va|rious remon&s;trances by the Agent&mdash;though as knowing the Man, to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed, they were all grounded on motives of Policy, not of Humanity; and of Expediency, which left Ju&s;tice entirely out of the Que&s;tion; but the great o&s;ten&s;ible ground of Quarrel was, that Middleton had dared to &s;pend <HI>two days</HI> in Negotiation&mdash;tho' that delay had prevented the general Ma&s;&s;acre of upwards of <HI>two thou&s;and per&s;ons!</HI>&mdash;The real cau&s;e, however, of this difference was a firm belief on the part of Mr. Ha&s;tings, that Mr. Middleton had inverted their different &s;itua|tions, and kept the <HI>Lion's Share</HI> of plunder to him&s;elf. There were undoubtedly &s;ome circum|&s;tances to ju&s;tify this &s;u&s;picion. At the time when Mr. Ha&s;tings had fir&s;t complained; the Nabob's Trea&s;ury was empty, and his troops &s;o mutinous for their pay, as even to threaten his Life; yet in this moment of <HI>Gratitude</HI> and <HI>Opu|lence,</HI> Middleton intimated the Nabob's De&s;ire to make Mr. Ha&s;tings a pre&s;ent of 100,000l. That facrifice, however, not being deemed &s;ufficient, Mr. Middleton was recalled, and Major Palmer was &s;ent in his room, with in&s;tructions to tell the Nabob that &s;uch a donation was <HI>not</HI> to be attempt|ed; the Prince, however, with an unfortunate want of recollection, &s;aid that <Q REND="inline">"no &s;uch offer had ever been in his mind."</Q>&mdash;Thus, it had always been con&s;idered as the heightening of a favor be|&s;towed that the receiver &s;hould not know from what quarter it came; but it was re&s;erved for Mr. Middleton to improve on this by &s;uch a <HI>deli|eate</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="21">
<HI>refinement,</HI> that the per&s;on giving &s;hould be totally ignorant of the favor he conferred!</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e little differences and &s;u&s;picions, Mr. Ha&s;tings and Mr. Middleton, on the return of the latter to Calcutta in October; 1782, continued to live in the &s;ame &s;tyle of <HI>friendly collu&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>fraudulent familiarity</HI> as ever. But when Mr. Bri&s;tow, not an&s;wering the purpo&s;es of Mr. Ha&s;tings, was accu&s;ed on the <HI>&s;nborned</HI> letters, procured from the Nabob, one of which pronounced him to be blacke&s;t Character in exi&s;tence, whil&s;t another, <HI>of the &s;ame date,</HI> &s;poke of him as a very hone&s;t fellow; Mr. Ha&s;tings thought it might appear particular, and therefore, after their late intimacy of &s;ix months, accu&s;es Mr. Middleton al&s;o before the Board at Calcutta. It was then that in the ra&s;h eagerne&s;s, which di&s;tin|gui&s;hed his pur&s;uit of every object, Mr. Ha&s;tings had incautiou&s;ly, but happily for the pre&s;ent pur|po&s;es of Ju&s;tice, brough forth tho&s;e &s;ecret letters. It mattered not what were the views which in|duced Mr. Ha&s;tings to bring to bring that Charge; whether he had drawn up the Accu&s;a|tion, or obliged Middleton with his <HI>aid</HI> in framing a <HI>Defence:</HI> the whole had ended in a repartee, and a poetical Quotation from the Governor General. The only circum&s;tance material to the purpo&s;es of humanity, was the production of in&s;truments, by which tho&s;e who had violated every principle of Ju&s;tice and Benevolence, were to &s;ee their Guilt explained, and, it was to be hoped, to experience that Puni&s;hment which they de&s;erved.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e <HI>private</HI> letters it was that their Lord|&s;hips were to look for whatever elucidation of the &s;ubject could be drawn from the parties concerned; written in the moments of confidence, they decla|red the real motive and object of each mea&s;ure; the <HI>public</HI> letters were only to be regarded as proofs of Guilt, whenever they e&s;tabli&s;hed a con|tradiction. The Coun&s;el for the Pri&s;oner had cho&s;en, as the &s;afe&s;t ground, to rely on the public letters, written for the concealment of fraud and purpo&s;e of deception. They had, for in&s;tance, particularly dwelt on a public letter from Mr. Mid|dleton, dated in December, 1781, which inti|mated &s;ome particulars of &s;uppo&s;ed contumacy in the Begums, with a view to countenance the tran&s;actions which &s;hortly after took place, and particularly the re&s;umption of the Jag|hires. But this letter both Sir Elijah Impey and Mr. Middleton had admitted, in their examina|tion at that bar, to be totally fal&s;e; though, if it were in every point true, the apprehen&s;ion of re|&s;i&s;tance to a mea&s;ure could not by any means be made a ground for the enforcement of that mea|&s;ure in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. The Coun&s;el &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed with Mr. Middleton for the an&s;wer, and therefore repeated the que&s;tion. The witne&s;s, however, did not readily fall into their humour; for he declared, that he did not recollect a parti|cle of the letter; and though <HI>Memory</HI> was un|doubtedly not the <HI>forte</HI> of Mr. Middleton, he was not, perhaps, entirely faulty on this occa&s;ion, as the letter was certainly of a <HI>later</HI> fabrication, and perhaps not from his hand. This letter, however, was al&s;o in direct contradiction to every one of the Defences &s;et up by Mr. Ha&s;tings.&mdash;Another pub|lic letter, which had been equally dwelt on, &s;poke of the <Q REND="inline">"determination of the Nabob,"</Q> to re&s;ume the Jaghires. It had appeared in evidence, that the Nabob could by no threats be compelled to yield to their mea&s;ures&mdash;that it was not until Mr. Middleton had actually i&s;&s;ued his own <HI>Perwannas</HI> for the Collection of the Rents, that the Nabob, rather than be brought to the utmo&s;t &s;tate of de|gradation, agreed to let the mea&s;ure be brought forward on his own act! The Re&s;i&s;tance of the Begums to that mea&s;ure was noticed in the &s;ame letter, as an in&s;tance of <HI>female levity</HI>&mdash;as if their defence of the property a&s;&s;igned for their &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence was to be made a reproach;&mdash;or that they de&s;erved a reproof for <HI>female lightne&s;s,</HI> by enter|taining a <HI>feminine</HI> objection&mdash;to their being <HI>&s;tarved!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">
This re&s;i&s;tance to the mea&s;ure, which was expect|ed, and the con&s;oling &s;laughter on which Mr. Ha&s;|tings relied, were looked to in all tho&s;e letters as a ju&s;tification of the mea&s;ure it&s;elf. There was not the &s;malle&s;t mention of the <HI>anterior</HI> rebellion, which by prudent <HI>after-thought</HI> had been &s;o greatly magnified. There was not a &s;yllable of tho&s;e dangerous machinations which were to have de|throned the Nabob;&mdash;of tho&s;e &s;anguinary artifices by which the Engli&s;h were to have been extirpat|ed.&mdash;Not a particle concerning tho&s;e practices was mentioned in any of Middleton's letters to Ha&s;|tings, or in the &s;till more confidential communica|tion which he maintained with Sir Elijah Impey: Though after the latter, his letters were continu|ally po&s;ting, even when the Chief Ju&s;tice was travelling round the country in &s;earch of affidavits. When on the 28th of November, he was bu&s;ies at Lucknow, on that honourable bu&s;ine&s;s, and when three days after he was found at Chunar, at the di&s;tance of 200 miles, prompting his in&s;tru|ments, and like <HI>Hamlet's</HI> Gho&s;t exclaiming&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"SWEAR!"</Q>&mdash;His progre&s;s on that occa&s;ion was &s;o whim&s;ically &s;udden, when contra&s;ted with the gravity of his employ, that an ob&s;erver would be tempted to quote again from the &s;ame &s;cene;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ha! Old</HI> TRUEPENNY, <HI>can'&s;t thou mole &s;o fa&s;t i' the ground?</HI>"</Q>&mdash;Here however the Compari&s;on cea&s;ed&mdash;for when Sir Elijah made his vi&s;it to Luc|know, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>to whet the almo&s;t blunted purpo&s;e</HI>"</Q> of the Nabob, his language was wholly different from that of the Poet:&mdash;it would have been much again&s;t his purpo&s;e to have &s;aid:
<Q><L>"Taint not thy mind, nor let thy &s;oul contrive</L>
<L>"Again&s;t thy MOTHER aught!"</L></Q>
On the &s;ubject of tho&s;e Affidavits, he would only make another &s;ingle ob&s;ervation.&mdash;Sir Elijah Im|pey had denied all acquaintance with their con|tents, tho' he had been actually accompanied to Buxar by Major Davy, who there tran|&s;lated them from the Per&s;ian, for the u&s;e of Mr. Ha&s;tings!&mdash;There was among&s;t them, an Affida|vit taken in Engli&s;h, from a Native at Buxar, but which was fir&s;t explained to the deponent by Major Davy in the pre&s;ence of Sir Elijah Impey!&mdash;How far therefore the a&s;&s;ertion of the Chief Ju&s;tice was plau&s;ible, and how far this fact was con&s;i&s;tent with that a&s;&s;ertion, he &s;hould leave it to their Lord&s;hips to determine.</P>
<P>It was in &s;ome degree ob&s;ervable, that not one of the private letters of Mr. Ha&s;tings, had been produced at any time!&mdash;Even Middleton, when all confidence was broken between them, by the production of his private corre&s;pondence at Cal|cutta, either feeling for his own &s;afety, or &s;unk under the fa&s;cinating influence of his ma&s;ter, did not dare to attempt a retaliation!&mdash;The letters of Middleton, however, were &s;ufficient to prove the &s;ituation of the Nabob, when pre&s;&s;ed to the mea|&s;ure of re&s;cuing the Jaghire, in which he had been repre&s;ented as acting wholly from him&s;elf.&mdash;He was there de&s;cribed as lo&s;t in &s;ullen melan|choly&mdash;with feelings agitated beyond expre&s;|&s;ion, and with every mark of agonized &s;en&s;ibility. To &s;uch a degree was this apparent, that even Middleton was moved to interfere for a temporary re&s;pite, in which he might be more reconciled to the mea&s;ure. <Q REND="inline">"I am fully of opinion, &s;aid he, that the de&s;pair of the Nabob mu&s;t impel him to violence; I know al&s;o that the violence mu&s;t be fatal to him&s;elf&mdash;but yet I think, that with his pre&s;ent feelings, he will di&s;regard all con&s;equences."</Q>&mdash;Mr. John&s;on al&s;o, the A&s;&s;i&s;tant Re&s;ident, wrote at the &s;ame time to Mr. Ha&s;tings to aver to him that the mea&s;ure was dangerous, that it would require a total Reform of the Collection which could not be made without a <HI>Campaign!</HI>&mdash;This was <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ju&s;tice, this was <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Humanity!

<P>In all the Annals of human Tyranny or human &s;uffering&mdash;in the accurate illu&s;trations of a TACITUS, or the luminous Pages of a GIB|BON, there did not occur &s;uch an in&s;tance of unexampled iniquity!&mdash;The victims of this oppre&s;&s;ion were confe&s;&s;edly de&s;titute of all power to re&s;i&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors; but that debility, which from other bo&s;oms would have claimed &s;ome Compa&s;&s;ion, with re&s;pect to the Mode of Suffering, here excited but the ingenuity of Torture! Even when every feeling of the Nabob was &s;ubdued, Nature made a lingering, feeble &s;tand within his bo&s;om; but even then that cold, unfeeling Spirit of Malignity, with whom his doom was fixed, returned with double Acri|mony to its purpo&s;e, and compelled him to inflict on a parent that De&s;truction, of which, he was him&s;elf re&s;erved but to be the la&s;t Victim!&mdash;To tho&s;e who looked with an equal and impartial eye to the ends of Ju&s;tice, and the intere&s;ts of Huma|nity, it would appear, that &s;ince the day of the <HI>Original Sin,</HI> a &s;cene &s;o iniquitou&s;ly cruel, or &s;o fraudfully dete&s;table, had never produced Re&s;ent|ment, or excited Compa&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>Yet when cruelty &s;eemed to have reached its bounds, and guilt to have a&s;cended to its climax, there was &s;omething in the character of Mr. Ha&s;t|ings, which &s;eemed to tran&s;cend the latter, and overleap the former;&mdash;and of this kind was the letter to the Nabob, which was di&s;patched on this occa&s;ion. To rebuke Mr. Middleton for his Mo|deration, as was in&s;tantly done, was ea&s;ily per|formed through the medium of a public and a private letter.&mdash;But to write to the Nabob in &s;uch a manner that the command might be conveyed, and yet the letter afterwards &s;hewn to the world, was a ta&s;k of more difficulty; but which it ap|peared by the event was admirably &s;uited to the genius of Mr. Ha&s;tings. His letter was dated the Fifteenth of February 1782, though the Jaghires had been then actually &s;eized&mdash;and it was in proof that it had been &s;ent at a much earlier period. He there a&s;&s;ured the Nabob of his coincidence with his wi&s;hes re&s;pect|ing the Re&s;umption of the Jaghires&mdash;he declares that if he found any difficulty in the mea&s;ure&mdash;he, Mr. Ha&s;tings, would go to his <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> in per&s;on, and lend his aid to <HI>puni&s;h</HI> tho&s;e who <HI>oppo&s;ed</HI> it&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"for that nothing could be more ardent than his friend&s;hip, or more eager than his zeal for his wel|fare."</Q> The mo&s;t de&s;perate intention was cloathed in the milde&s;t language&mdash;but the Nabob knew by &s;ad experience the character with whom he had to deal, and therefore was not to be deceived; he &s;aw the <HI>Dagger</HI> gli&s;tening in the hand which was treacherou&s;ly extended, as if to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;and from that moment the la&s;t faint Ray of Nature ex|pired in his Bo&s;om. Mr. Middleton, from that time extended his Iron Sceptre without Re&s;i&s;tance&mdash;the Jaghires were &s;eized, every mea&s;ure was carried, and the Nabob, his Feelings wounded, and his Dignity degraded, was no longer con&s;idered as an object of Regard.&mdash;Though the&s;e were circum&s;tances exa&s;perating to the human heart, which felt the &s;malle&s;t remains of &s;en&s;ibility, yet it was nece&s;&s;ary, in idea, to review the whole from the time that this treach|ery was fir&s;t conceived, to that when by a &s;eries of artifices the mo&s;t execrable, it was brought to a completion. Mr. Ha&s;tings would there be &s;een &s;tanding aloof indeed, but not inactive in the war! He would be di&s;covered reviewing his agents, rebuking at one time the pale con&s;cience of Mr. Middleton, and at another relying on the &s;touter villainy of Hyder Beg Cawn. With all the calmne&s;s of veteran delinquency, his eye ranged through the bu&s;y pro&s;pect, piercing through the darkne&s;s of &s;ubordinate guilt, and arranging, with congenial adroitne&s;s the agents of his Crimes and the in&s;truments of his Cruelty.</P>
<P>The feelings of the &s;everal parties at the time would be mo&s;t properly judged of, by their re&s;pec|tive
<PB N="23" REF="24">
corre&s;pondence. When the Bhow Begum, de&s;pairing of redre&s;s from the Nabob, addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Mr. Middleton, and reminded him of the Guarantee which he had &s;igned, &s;he was in|&s;tantly promi&s;ed that the amount of her Jaghire &s;hould be made good, though Mr. Middleton &s;aid he could not interfere with the <HI>&s;overeign</HI> de|ci&s;ion of the Nabob re&s;pecting the lands. The deluded and unfortunate woman <Q REND="inline">"thanked God that Mr. Middleton was at hand for her relief;"</Q> at the very in&s;tant when he was directing every ef|fort to her de&s;truction;&mdash;when he had ac|tually written the orders which were to take the collection out of the hands of her agents! Even when the Begum was undeceived&mdash;when &s;he found that Briti&s;h faith was no protec|tion, when &s;he found that &s;he &s;hould leave the country, and prayed to the God of nations not to grant his peace to tho&s;e who remained behind;&mdash;there was &s;till no charge of <HI>rebellion,</HI> no re-crimi|nation made to all her reproaches for the broken faith of the Enli&s;h. Even when &s;tung to mad|ne&s;s, &s;he a&s;ked <Q REND="inline">"how long would be their reign;"</Q> no mention of her di&s;affection was brought for|ward; the &s;tre&s;s was therefore idle, which the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner &s;trove to lay on the&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions of an injured and enraged woman.&mdash;When at la&s;t irritated beyond bearing, &s;he de|nounced INFAMY on the heads of her Oppre&s;&s;ors, who was there who would not &s;ay that &s;he &s;poke in a <HI>prophetic</HI> &s;pirit, and that what &s;he had then predicted had not, even to its la&s;t letter, been accompli&s;hed! But did Mr. Middleton even to this violence, retort any particle of accu&s;ation? No; he &s;ent a <HI>joco&s;e</HI> reply, &s;tating that he had re|ceived &s;uch a letter under her &s;eal, but that from its Contents he could not &s;u&s;pect it to come from her, and begging therefore that &s;he might endeavour to detect the <HI>Forgery!</HI>&mdash;Thus did he add to foul injuries, the vile aggravation of a <HI>bru|tal Je&s;t;</HI>&mdash;like the Tigers that prowl over the Scene where his Ravages were committed, he &s;hewed the &s;avagene&s;s of his Nature, by grinning over his Prey, and fawning over the la&s;t Agonies of his un|fortunate Victim.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e letters were then enclo&s;ed to the Nabob, who no more than the re&s;t, made any attempt to ju&s;tify him&s;elf by imputing any criminality to the Begums. He only &s;ighed a Hope, that his Conduct to his Farents had drawn no &s;hame upon his head; and declaredhis intention to puni&s;h.&mdash;not any di&s;affection in the <HI>Begums</HI>&mdash;but &s;ome officious &s;ervants who had dared to ferment the mi&s;under&s;tanding between them and the Nabob.&mdash;A letter was finally &s;ent to Mr. Ha&s;tings, about &s;ix days before the Seizure of the Trea&s;ure from the Begums, declaring their innocence, and re|ferring the Governor General to Captain Gordon, who&s;e life they had protected, and who&s;e &s;afety &s;hould have been their ju&s;tification. That En|quiry was never made; it was looked on as un|nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;becau&s;e the conviction of their inno|cence was too deeply impre&s;&s;ed!</P>
<P>The Council in recommending an attention to the Public, in preference to the Privae letters, had remarked in particular, that one letter &s;hould not be taken as evidence, becau&s;e it was evidently and ab&s;tractedly private, as it contained in one part, the anxieties of Mr. Middleton, for the illne&s;s of his &s;on.&mdash;This was a &s;ingular argument indeed. The circum&s;tance undoubt|edly merited &s;trict ob&s;ervation, though not in the view in which it was placed by the Coun&s;el.&mdash;It went to &s;hew that &s;ome at lea&s;t of tho&s;e concern|ed in the&s;e tran&s;actions, felt the force of tho&s;e ties, which their efforts were directed to tear a&s;under.&mdash;that tho&s;e who could ridicule the re&s;pective at|tachment of a MOTHER and a SON, who would prohibit the reverence of the Son to the Mother, who had given him life,&mdash;who could deny to <HI>ma|ternal debility</HI> the protection which <HI>filial tender|ne&s;s</HI> &s;hould afford:&mdash;were yet &s;en&s;ible of the <HI>&s;training</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>chords,</HI> by which they were con|nected.&mdash;There was &s;omething in the pre&s;ent bu|&s;ine&s;s,

with all that was horrible to create <HI>aver&s;ion,</HI>&mdash;&s;o vilely loath&s;ome, as to excite <HI>Di&s;gu&s;t;</HI>&mdash;if it were not a part of his duty it would be &s;uperfluous to &s;peak of the &s;acredne&s;s of the ties which tho&s;e aliens to feeling&mdash;tho&s;e Apo&s;tates to Humanity had thus divided.&mdash;In &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly, &s;aid Mr. Sheridan, as that before which I &s;peak, there is not an eye but mu&s;t look reproof to this conduct&mdash;not a heart but mo&s;t an|ticipate its condemnation.&mdash;FILIAL PIETY! It is the primal bond of Society&mdash;it is the SACRA|MENT of our EXISTENCE. It is almo&s;t an <HI>innate</HI> principle, which &s;tarts unbidden to our lip, which con&s;ults not our Memory, nor awaits our Rea&s;on.&mdash;It is a GRATITUDE implanted for a thou&s;and wakeful cares&mdash;a thou&s;and namele&s;s &s;olicitudes; for the&s;e attentions, which not being remembered, are the more entitled to our Gratitude, as having been exerci&s;ed at a time when the dawning Rea&s;on could not ob&s;erve, nor the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ant Memory record. It is a &s;en&s;ation, twined in the heart's inmo&s;t core, and coeval with our earlie&s;t &s;en&s;e of exi&s;tence.&mdash;Tho&s;e who violated this &s;olemn covenant, mu&s;t at the in&s;tant have &s;tood convicted to them&s;elves;&mdash;the &s;low-judging formalities of the law are &s;u|perfluous&mdash;they are returned as GUILTY by the general verdict of mankind!"</P>
<P>The Jaghires being &s;eized, Mr. Sheridan pro|ceeded to ob&s;erve, the <HI>Begums</HI> were left without the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of that pecuniary compen&s;ation promi&s;ed by Mr. Middleton; and as when ty|ranny and <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> take the field, they are always attended by their <HI>camp-followers,</HI> paltry pilfering, and petty in&s;ult&mdash;&s;o in this in&s;tance, the goods taken from them were &s;old at a mock &s;ale at in|ferior value. Even gold and jewels, to u&s;e the language of the Begums, in&s;tantly lo&s;t their value when it was known that they came from them! Their Mini&s;ters were therefore impri&s;oned to extort the deficiency which this fraud had occa&s;ioned; and tho&s;e mean arts were employed to ju&s;tify a continuance of cruelty; yet the&s;e again were little to the frauds of Mr. Ha&s;tings. After extorting upwards of 600,000l. he forbade Mr. Middleton to come to a <HI>conclu&s;ive &s;ettlement.</HI>&mdash;He knew that the <HI>Trea&s;ons</HI> of our Allies in In|dia had their origin &s;olely in the wants of the Com|pany. He could not therefore &s;ay that the Be|gums were entirely innocent, until he had con|&s;ulted the general <HI>Record</HI> of <HI>Crimes</HI>&mdash;in the <HI>Ca&s;h Account</HI> at Calcutta!&mdash;And this <HI>prudence</HI> of Mr. Ha&s;tings was fully ju&s;tified by the event&mdash;for there was actually found a balance of <HI>Twenty-&s;ix lacks</HI> more, again&s;t the Begums, which 260,000l. worth of Trea&s;on, had never been dreamt of be|fore. <Q REND="inline">"Talk not to us,"</Q> &s;aid the Governor Ge|neral, of their Guilt or Innocence, but as it &s;uits the Company's <HI>Credit!</HI> We will not try them by the Code of <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> nor the In&s;titutes of <HI>Timur</HI>&mdash;we will not judge them either by the Bri|ti&s;h Laws, or their local Cu&s;toms!

<P>Proceeding next to &s;tate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Be|gums in the Zenana, and of the women in the Khord Mahal, Mr. Sheridan remarked, that &s;ome ob&s;er|vation was due to the remark made by Mr. Ha&s;tings in his Defence, where he declared&mdash;" that whatever were the di&s;tre&s;&s;es there, and whoever was the agent, the Mea&s;ure was in his opinion reconcile|able to Ju&s;tice, Honor, and &s;ound Policy. Ma|jor Scott&mdash;<HI>the incomparable Agent</HI> of Mr. Ha&s;|tings had declared this pa&s;&s;age to have been writ|ten by Mr. Ha&s;tings, with his own hand.&mdash;Then Mr. Middleton, it appeared, had avowed his &s;hare in tho&s;e humane tran&s;actions, and blu&s;hingly retired. Mr. Ha&s;tings then cheered his drooping Spirits.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Whatever part of the load, &s;aid he, yours cannot bear, my <HI>unburdened</HI> character &s;hall a&s;&s;ume. I will crown your labours with my irre&s;i&s;tible approbation&mdash;then we <HI>twin-warriors</HI> &s;hall go forth&mdash;do you find <HI>Memory,</HI> and I'll find <HI>Character</HI>&mdash;and a&s;&s;ault, repul&s;e, and contumely &s;hall all be &s;et at defiance!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">
If I could not prove, continued Mr. Sheridan that tho&s;e Acts of Mr. Middleton were in reality the Acts of Mr. Ha&s;tings, I &s;hould not trouble your Lord&s;hips by combating the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions; but as that part of his criminality can be inconte&s;tibly a&s;certained,&mdash;I &s;hall undoubtedly appeal to the a&s;&s;embled Legi&s;lators of this Realm, and call on them to &s;ay, whether tho&s;e Acts were ju&s;tifiable on the &s;core of <HI>Policy;</HI>&mdash;I &s;hall appeal to all the augu&s;t Pre&s;idents in the Courts of Briti&s;h Ju&s;tice, and to all the learned Ornaments of the Profe&s;&s;ion to decide whether the&s;e Actions were reconcileable to <HI>Ju&s;tice;</HI>&mdash;I &s;hall appeal to a reverend A&s;&s;em|blage of Prelates feeling for the general intere&s;ts of Humanity, and for the honor of the Religion to which they belong; let them determine in their own minds whether tho&s;e Acts of Mr. Ha&s;tings, and Mr. Middleton, were &s;uch a <HI>Chri&s;|tian</HI> ought to perform, or a <HI>Man</HI> to avow!</P>
<P>He then proceeded to relate the circum&s;tances of the Impri&s;onment of Bahar Ally Cawn, and Jewar Ally Cawn, the Mini&s;ter of the Nabob, on the grounds above &s;tated: With them was con|fined, that <HI>Arch-rebel</HI> Sump&s;hier Cawn, by whom every act of ho&s;tility, that had taken place again&s;t the Engli&s;h, was &s;tated to have been committed.&mdash;No enquiry, however, was made concerning his <HI>Trea&s;on,</HI> though many been held re&s;pecting the <HI>Trea&s;ure</HI> of the others. He was not &s;o far noticed as to be deprived of his <HI>food;</HI> nor was he even complimented with <HI>fetters!</HI> and yet when he is on a future day to be informed of the Michiefs he was now &s;tated to have done, he mu&s;t think that on being forgotten, he had a very <HI>providen|tial e&s;cape!</HI>&mdash;The others were, on the contrary, taken from their milder Pri&s;on at Fyzabad; and when threats could effect nothing, transferred by the meek humanity of Mr. Middleton to the For|tre&s;s of Chunargur. There, where the Briti&s;h Flag was flying, they were doomed to deeper dun|geons, heavier chains, and &s;everer puni&s;hments. Three where that Flag was di&s;played, which was wont to chear the depre&s;&s;ed, and to dilate the &s;ub|dued heart of mi&s;ery&mdash;the&s;e venerable, but unfor|tunate men, were fated to encounter &s;omething <HI>lower</HI> than PERDITION, and &s;omething <HI>blacker</HI> than DESPAIR! It appeared from the evidence of Mr. <HI>Holt</HI> and others, that they were both cruel|ly flogged, tho' one was above &s;eventy years of age, to extort a Confe&s;&s;ion of the buried Wealth of the Begums!&mdash;Being charged with a Di&s;affection; they proclaimed their innocence;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"tell us where are the remaining Trea&s;ures, was the reply&mdash;it is only a treachery to your immediate Sovereigns:&mdash;and you will then be fit a&s;&s;ociates for the repre&s;entatives of Briti&s;h Faith and Briti&s;h Ju&s;tice in India!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh! FAITH, Oh JUSTICE! exclaimed Mr. Sheridan, I conjure you by your &s;acred names to depart for a moment from this Place, though it be your peculiar Re&s;idence; nor hear your Names profaned, by &s;uch a &s;acrilegious Combination, as that which I am now compelled to repeat!"</Q></P>
<P>It might have been hoped, for the honor of the human heart, that the Begums had been them|&s;elves exempted from a &s;hare in the&s;e &s;ufferings, and that they had been wounded only through the &s;ides of their Mini&s;ters.&mdash;The rever&s;e of this, however, was the fact.&mdash;Their Palace was &s;ur|rounded by a guard, which was withdrawn by Major Gilpin, to avoid the growing re&s;entments of the people, and replaced by Mr. Middleton, thro' his fears from that <Q REND="inline">"dreadful re&s;pon&s;ibility"</Q> which was impo&s;ed on him by Mr. Ha&s;tings.&mdash;The Women of the Khord Mahal, who had not been involved in the Begum's &s;uppo&s;ed crimes; who had rai&s;ed no <HI>&s;ub-rebellion</HI> of their own, and who it had been proved, lived in a di&s;tinct dwell|ing, were cau&s;ele&s;sly involved in the &s;ame puni&s;h|ment; their Re&s;idence &s;urrounded with guards, they were driven to de&s;pair by famine, and when they poured forth in &s;ad proce&s;&s;ion, were driven back by the &s;oldiery, and beaten with <HI>Bludgeons</HI> to the &s;cene of Madne&s;s, which they had quitted. Tho&s;e were acts, Mr. Sheridan ob&s;erved, which,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
when told, needed no Comment; he &s;hould not offer a &s;ingle &s;yllable to awaken their Lord&s;hip's feelings; but leave it to the facts which had been proved, to make their own impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The argument now reverted &s;olely to this point, whether Mr. Ha&s;tings was to be an&s;werable for the crimes committed by his agents? It had been fully proved that Mr. Middleton had &s;igned the treaty with the &s;uperior Begum in October, 1778. He had acknowledged &s;igning &s;ome others of other dates, but could not <HI>recollect</HI> his au|thority. The&s;e treaties had been fully recognized by Mr. Ha&s;tings, as was fully proved by the evi|dence of Mr. Purling, in the year 1780. In that of Oct. 1778, the Jaghire was &s;ecured, which was al|lotted for the &s;upport of the women in the Khord Mahal: on the fir&s;t idea of re&s;uming tho&s;e Jag|hires a provi&s;ion &s;hould have been &s;ecured to the&s;e unfortunate women, and in this re&s;pect Mr. Ha&s;|tings was clearly guilty of a Crime, by his <HI>Omi&s;&s;ion</HI> of making &s;uch provi&s;ion. But &s;till he pleaded, that he was not accountable for the Cruelties which had been exerci&s;ed. This was the Plea which TYRANNY aided by its <HI>prime mini&s;ter,</HI> Trea|chery, was always &s;ure to &s;et up. Mr. Middle|ton had attempted to &s;trengthen this plea, by endeavouring to claim the whole Infamy of tho&s;e tran&s;actions, and to <HI>monopolize</HI> the Guilt! He da|red even to aver that he had been condemned by Mr. Ha&s;tings for the ignominious part he had acted;&mdash;he dared to avow this, becau&s;e Mr. Ha&s;|tings was on his Trial, and he thought he &s;hould never be tried;&mdash;but in the face of the Court, and before he left the Bar, he was compelled to confe&s;s that it was for the <HI>lenience,</HI> not the <HI>&s;everity</HI> of his Proceedings that he had been reproved by Mr. Ha&s;tings.</P>
<P>It would not, he tru&s;ted, be argued, that be|cau&s;e Mr. Ha&s;tings had not marked every pa&s;&s;ing &s;hade of guilt, and becau&s;e he had only given the bold outline of Cruelty, that he was therefore to be acquitted.&mdash;It was laid down by the law of En|gland&mdash;that law which was the perfection of Rea|&s;on,&mdash;that a Per&s;on ordering an Act to be done by his Agent, was an&s;werable for that act with all his con&s;equences. Middleton had been appointed in 1777, the avowed and private Agent&mdash;the <HI>&s;econd|&s;elf</HI> of Mr. Ha&s;tings. The Governor General had ordered the mea&s;ure: Middleton declared that it could not have been effected by milder means. If he never &s;aw, nor heard afterwards of the con&s;e|quences of the mea&s;ure, he was an&s;werable there|fore for every pang that was inflicted, and for all the blood that was &s;hed. But he had heard, and that in&s;tantly of the whole. He had written to arraign Middleton of forbearance and of neg|lect!&mdash;He commanded them to work upon their hopes and fears, and to leave no means untried, until&mdash;to &s;peak their own language, but which would be better &s;uited to the <HI>Banditti</HI> of a <HI>Cavern</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"they obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ecret hoards of the old Ladies."</Q>&mdash;He would not allow even of a delay of two days to &s;mooth the compelled ap|proaches of a SON to his MOTHER, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion!&mdash;His orders were peremptory;&mdash;and if a ma&s;&s;acre did not take place, it was the merit of accident&mdash;and not of Mr. Ha&s;tings.&mdash;After this would it be &s;aid, that the pri&s;oner was ignorant of the acts, or not culpable for their con&s;equences? It was true, he had not enjoined in &s;o many words the <HI>Guards,</HI> the <HI>Famine,</HI> and the <HI>Bludgeons:</HI> he had not weighed the <HI>fetters,</HI> nor numbered the <HI>la&s;hes</HI> to be inflicted on his victims. But yet he was equally guilty as if he had borne an active and per&s;onal &s;hare in each tran&s;action. It was, as if he had commanded that the <HI>heart</HI> &s;hould be torn from the bo&s;om, and yet had en|joined that no <HI>blood</HI> &s;hould follow. He was in the &s;ame degree accountable to the <HI>Law,</HI> to his <HI>Coun|try,</HI> to his <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> and to his GOD!</P>
<P>Mr. Ha&s;tings had endeavoured al&s;o to get rid of a part of his Guilt, by ob&s;erving that he was but
<PB N="27" REF="28">
<HI>one</HI> of the Supreme Council, and that all the re&s;t had &s;anctioned tho&s;e tran&s;actions with their appro|bation. If Mr. Ha&s;tings could prove, however, that others participated in the Guilt, it would not tend to dimini&s;h his own Criminality. But the fact was, that the Council had in nothing erred &s;o much as in a criminal Credulity given to the declara|tions of the Governor General. They knew not a word of tho&s;e tran&s;actions until they were finally concluded.&mdash;It was not until the January following, that they &s;aw the Ma&s;s of Fal&s;hood which had been publi&s;hed under the title of <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Ha&s;tings' Narrative."</Q> They had been then unaccountably duped into the &s;uffering a Let|ter to pa&s;s, dated the 29th of November, intended to deceive the Directors into a belief, that they had received intelligence at that time, which was not the fact.&mdash;The&s;e Ob&s;ervations, Mr. Sheridan &s;aid, were not meant to ca&s;t any obloquy on the Council;&mdash;they had undoubtedly been de|ceived, and the deceit practi&s;ed on them by mak|ing them &s;ign the Narrative, was of it&s;elf a &s;trong accu&s;ation of Mr. Ha&s;tings, and a decided proof of his own Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Guilt. When tired of corporal Infliction, his Tyranny was gratified by in&s;ulting the under&s;tanding. Other Tyrants, tho' born to greatne&s;s, &s;uch as a NERO, or CALI|GULA, might have been rou&s;ed, it had been &s;uppo&s;ed, by reflection, and awakened into contri|tion;&mdash;but here was an in&s;tance which &s;purned at Theory, and baffled &s;uppo&s;ition; a man born to a &s;tate at lea&s;t of equality; inured to calculation and brought up in habits of reflection;&mdash;and yet prov|ing in the end that Mon&s;ter in Nature, a <HI>deliberate and rea&s;oning Tyrant!</HI></P>
<P>The Board of Directors received tho&s;e advices which Mr. Ha&s;ting's thought proper to tran&s;mit, but though unfurni&s;hed with any other materials to form their judgment, they expre&s;&s;ed very &s;trongly their doubts, and as properly ordered an Enquiry into the circum&s;tances of the alledged Di&s;affection of of the Begums; pronouncing it at the &s;ame time a Debt which was due to the Honor and Ju&s;tice of the Briti&s;h Nation.&mdash;This enquiry however on the Directions reaching India, Mr. Ha&s;tings thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to elude.&mdash;He &s;tated to the Council, that it being merely &s;tated that <Q REND="inline">"IF on enquiry, certain facts ap|peared,"</Q> no enquiry was thereby directly en|joined!&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It would revive (he &s;aid) tho&s;e ani|mo&s;ities that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Begums and the Vizier, which had then &s;ub&s;ided;&mdash;if the former were inclined to appeal to a foreign ju|ri&s;diction, they were the be&s;t judges of their own feeling, and &s;hould be left to make their own complaint."</Q>&mdash;All this, however, was no|thing to the magnificent paragraph which con|cluded this Minute, and to which Mr. She|ridan al&s;o reque&s;ted the attention of the Court.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Be&s;ide, &s;aid Mr. Ha&s;tings, I hope it will not be a departure from official language to &s;ay&mdash;that the MAJESTY of JUSTICE ought not to be approached without &s;olicitation: &s;he ought not to de&s;cend to enflame or provoke, but to with-ho'd her judgment, until &s;he is called on to determine!"</Q> What was &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing, was that Sir John Macpher&s;on, who had before oppo&s;ed Mr. Ha&s;t|ings, was caught by this <HI>bold bomba&s;tic quibble,</HI> and rejoined in the &s;ame words, <Q REND="inline">"that the MA|JESTY of JUSTICE, ought not to be approached, without &s;olicitation!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But my Lords, continued Mr. Sheridan, I rely on the Judgment of your Lord&s;hips for a very different opinion. I hear you already call on me to turn from the ill-&s;haped <HI>Pagod,</HI>&mdash;from the mon|&s;trous Idol, which this bold Man at your Bar, has thus &s;et up, and to which he has dared to give the appellation of JUSTICE;&mdash;I hear you command me to turn from the <HI>deba&s;ed Caricature,</HI> to contem|plate the figure of JUSTICE, where &s;he &s;its in her more dignified form, and her more augu&s;t Tri|bunal,&mdash;HERE;&mdash;to a <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> commanding, yet not rigorous; efficient, yet not &s;anguinary:&mdash;to a Ju&s;tice, active and regardful, yet without
