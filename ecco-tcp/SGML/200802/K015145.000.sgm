<P>We have followed the Authority of Sir <HI>David Dalrymple,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel John&s;on,</HI> in the Orthography of Mr. <HI>Malloch</HI>'s Name; as we ima|gine the Deci&s;ion of the&s;e Gentle|men will have more weight in the World of Letters, than even that of the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Malloch</HI> him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CRITICAL STRICTURES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN our Strictures on the Tragedy of <HI>Elvira,</HI> we &s;hall not ha&s;ten all at once into the mid&s;t of Things, according to the Rules of Epic Poe|try; Heroic Poems and Remarks on New Plays, are things &s;o e&s;&s;en|tially different, that they ought not to be written by the &s;ame Rules.
<PB N="8" REF="5">
Had Mr. <HI>Malloch</HI> been aware of the&s;e Di&s;tinctions in writing, which &s;urely are not very nice, he probably would have di&s;covered that Scenes admirably adapted for forming a Burle&s;que Tragedy, would never &s;uc|ceed in forming a &s;erious Drama. In the Prologue the Author informs us, that the Preliminaries of Peace are &s;igned, and the War now over, and he humbly hopes, as we have &s;pared the <HI>French,</HI> we will &s;pare his Tragedy. But as the Principles of Re&s;titution &s;eem at pre&s;ent &s;trong in this Nation, before we extend our Mercy to him, we in&s;i&s;t that in imi|tation of his Superiors, he &s;hall re|&s;tore every thing valuable he has plunder'd from the <HI>French</HI> during the Cour&s;e of his &s;ad and tedious Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="6">
In the fir&s;t Scene of this Tragedy a Gentleman who has been abroad, during the Wars, reque&s;ts his Friend to acquaint him with what has pa&s;t at Court in the time of his Ab&s;ence. We were equally &s;urprized and de|lighted with this new Method of informing the Spectators of the Tran&s;actions prior to the Commence|ment of the Play; nothing can be more natural, for we imagine the Art of conveying Letters by Po&s;t was at that time undi&s;covered. We mu&s;t indeed acknowledge, that dur|ing the time of the Roman Empire Letters were tran&s;mitted with the utmo&s;t Celerity from one Part to another of tho&s;e immen&s;e Domin|ions; but we al&s;o know, that after
<PB N="10" REF="7">
the Subver&s;ion of that State by the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> the fir&s;t Act of Cruelty committed by the&s;e Barbarians was murdering all the Po&s;t-Boys in cold Blood: In like manner as our inhuman <HI>Edward</HI> upon his compleating the Conque&s;t of <HI>Wales,</HI> ordered all the Bards to be put to Death, among&s;t the Num|ber of which had Mr. <HI>Malloch</HI> been included we had not now been tor|tured with his execrable Tragedy. Novelty of the &s;ame kind with this we have mentioned runs thro' the whole Play, almo&s;t every Scene be|ing an Interview and a <HI>t&ecirc;te a t&ecirc;te.</HI> The King wants to &s;ee his Son, the Queen wants to &s;ee <HI>Elvira, Elvira</HI> wants to &s;ee the King, and &s;o on thro' the Five Acts.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="8">
No new Thoughts or Sentiments are to be found in this Performance, we meet only with old ones ab&s;urdly expre&s;&s;ed. <HI>Dryden</HI> &s;aid that <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> was every where to be traced in the Snow of the Ancients. We may &s;ay that <HI>Malloch</HI> is every where to be traced in the Puddle of the Moderns. In&s;tead of &s;electing the Beauties, he has pick'd out what|ever is de&s;picable in <HI>Shake&s;peare, Ot|way, Dryden,</HI> and <HI>Rowe,</HI> like a Pick-Pocket who dives for Handkerchiefs, not for Gold; and contents him&s;elf with what he finds in our Great Coat Pocket, without attempting our Watch or your Pur&s;e. Tho' Mr. <HI>Malloch</HI> may only mean to borrow, yet as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no Fund of Ori|ginal
<PB N="12" REF="9">
Genius from whence he can pay his Debts, borrowing, we are afraid is an inadequate Expre&s;&s;ion, the har&s;her one of &s;tealing we mu&s;t therefore, tho' reluctantly, &s;ub&s;titute in its room. In the Prologue he acknowledges him&s;elf a Culprit, but as the Lo&s;s of what he has pilfered is in&s;ignificant to the Owners, we &s;hall bring him in guilty only of Petty Larcenary: We believe he has been driven, like poor People in this &s;evere Weather by dire Nece&s;&s;ity, to &s;uch di&s;hone&s;t Shifts.</P>
<P>In this Play the Author has in|troduced a Rebellion unparalleled in any Hi&s;tory, Ancient or Modern. He rai&s;es his Rebellions as a &s;kilful Gardener does his Mu&s;hrooms, in a Moment; and like an artful Nur&s;e,
<PB N="13" REF="10">
he lulls in a Moment the fretful Child a&s;leep. The Prince enters an Appartment of the Palace with a drawn Sword; this forms the Re|bellion. The King enters the &s;ame Appartment without a drawn Sword. This qua&s;hes the Rebellion. How to credit this Story, or to pardon this poetical Licence, we are greatly at a Lo&s;s; for we know in the Year 1745 three thou&s;and Mountaineers actually appeared at <HI>Derby. Cata|line,</HI> we are credibly informed, had a Gang of at lea&s;t a Dozen &s;tout Fellows; and it is pretty certain that <HI>Bedemar,</HI> when going to in&s;lave <HI>Venice,</HI> had provided Pi&s;tols and Battle Powder for more than fifteen fighting Men. We are almo&s;t tempt|ed to think, that Mr. <HI>Malloch</HI> gets his Rebellions ready made, like his
<PB N="14" REF="11">
<HI>Scotch</HI> Tobacco, cut and dry, at the Sign of the Valiant Highlander.</P>
<P>Our great Author po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, in its utmo&s;t Perfection, the happy Art of uniting rival Ladies, and of &s;et|ting at Variance a virtuous Father and Son. How intimate his Ac|quaintance with Human Nature! How deep his Knowledge of the Pa&s;&s;ions! No le&s;s exqui&s;ite and re|fined in his Morality, like a true Di&s;ciple of Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> he unites Vice and Virtue mo&s;t lovingly together; witne&s;s this memorable Line of the King's, addre&s;&s;ed to <HI>Elvira;</HI>
<Q><L><HI>'Mid&s;t all your Guilt I mu&s;t ad|mire your Virtue.</HI></L></Q>
<PB N="15" REF="12">
Let us invert this Line,<Q><L>'Mid&s;t all your Virtue I mu&s;t ab|hor your Guilt.</L> Let us parody it;</Q><Q><L>O Mr. <HI>David Malloch!</HI> 'mid&s;t all your Dullne&s;s I mu&s;t admire your Genius.</L></Q></P>
<P>We heard it once a&s;&s;erted by <HI>Da|vid Hume,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> that Mr. <HI>Malloch</HI> was de&s;titute of the Pathetic. In this Ob&s;ervation however we beg leave to differ with him. In the fourth Act the whole Board of Por|tugue&s;e Privy Coun&s;ellors are melted into Tears. The Trial of the Prince moves the Hearts of tho&s;e Mon&s;ters of Iniquity, tho&s;e Members of In|qui&s;ition, when the le&s;s humane Au|dience are in Danger, from the Te|diou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="16" REF="13">
of two in&s;ipid Harangues, of falling fa&s;t a&s;leep. This maje&s;tic Scene is too exactly copied from a Trial at the <HI>Old Bailey,</HI> to have even the Merit of Originality. And indeed it is to the Lenity of the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> that we owe by far the greater Part of this amazing Play. The good Man lets his re|bellious Subjects out of Pri&s;on to chat with him, when a wi&s;er Mo|narch would have kept them clo&s;e confined in <HI>Newgate.</HI> The incom|parable Action of that univer&s;al Ge|nius Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> alone, &s;aved this Act from the Damnation it de&s;erved. Had not he, like a &s;econd <HI>Aeneas,</HI> carried the old doating and decrepid Father on his Back, he mu&s;t have lain by the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y. Tho' we mu&s;t ob&s;erve another Character in this Play
<PB N="17" REF="14">
&s;eemed better &s;uited to the Impe|tuo&s;ity and Fire of this Actor. We could not but &s;mile at the Humour of a merry Wag in the Pit, who at the Conclu&s;ion of one of the mo&s;t tire&s;ome Pleadings, with &s;ome De|gree of Impatience and Emotion called out, <HI>Encore, encore.</HI></P>
<P>In the fifth Act we were melted with the Sight of two young Chil|dren which the King embraced, which the Prince embraced, which <HI>Elvira</HI> embraced. Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> in the 44th No. of the <HI>Spectator,</HI> has &s;ome Remarks &s;o judicious and lively on the Practice of introducing Chil|dren on the Stage, that we mu&s;t beg leave to tran&s;cribe the Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="15"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A di&s;con&s;olate Mother with a Child in her Hand, has frequent|ly drawn Compa&s;&s;ion from the Audience, and has therefore gain|ed a Place in &s;everal Tragedies; a modern Writer who ob&s;erved how this had taken in other Plays, being re&s;olved to double the Di&s;|tre&s;s, and melt his Audience twice as much as tho&s;e before him had done, brought a Prince&s;s on the Stage with a little Boy in one Hand, and a Girl in the other. A third Poet being re&s;olved to out-write all his Predece&s;&s;ors, a few Years ago introduced three Children with great Succe&s;s; and as I am informed a young Gentle|man who is &s;ully determined to break the mo&s;t obdurate Heart, has
<PB N="19" REF="16">
a Tragedy by him where the fir&s;t Per&s;on that appears on the Stage is an afflicted Widow, in her mourning Weeds, with half a do|zen fatherle&s;s Children attending her, like tho&s;e that u&s;ually hang about the Figure of Charity. Thus &s;everal Incidents that are beautiful in a good Writer be|come ridiculous by falling into the Hands of a bad one."</Q></P>
<P>We would &s;ugge&s;t to Mr. <HI>Malloch</HI> the u&s;eful Hint of introducing in &s;ome of his future Productions, the whole Foundling Ho&s;pital, which with a well painted Scene of the Edifice it&s;elf would certainly call forth the warme&s;t Tears of Pity, and the bittere&s;t Emotions of Di&s;tre&s;s;
<PB N="20" REF="17">
e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that many of the Parents of the&s;e unfor|tunate Babes would probably be Spectators of this intere&s;ting Scene.</P>
<P>The Conclu&s;ion of the Piece is as abrupt as the other Parts of it are ab&s;urd. We &s;hould be much at a Lo&s;s to gue&s;s by whom the Poi&s;on is admini&s;tered to <HI>Elvira,</HI> were we not aided in our Conjectures by the &s;hrewd Su&s;picions which the King, tho' otherwi&s;e a very loving Hu&s;|band, &s;eems to entertain of his Wife. Upon my regreting that her Maje&s;ty, if guilty, &s;hould e&s;cape without poetical Ju&s;tice at lea&s;t, a Gentleman who &s;at behind me, a Friend as I &s;uppo&s;ed of the Author, a&s;&s;ured me her Puni&s;hment was re|&s;erved for the Farce, which for that
<PB N="21" REF="18">
Purpo&s;e was, contrary to Cu&s;tom, added to the Play.</P>
<P>Though in general this Tragedy is colder than the mo&s;t extreme Parts of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> yet we now and then feel a Warmth, but it is &s;uch a Warmth or Glow rath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, as is &s;ometimes produced by the Hand|ling of Snow.</P>
<P>Bad as this Play is, yet will the Author have the Profits of his Three Nights: Few on the Fir&s;t Night having either Ta&s;te or Spirit to ex|pre&s;s their Di&s;approbation. Like the Ra&s;cals who plundered <HI>Li&s;bon</HI> after the Earthquake, Mr. <HI>David Malloch</HI> will extract Guineas out of Rubbi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="19">
We &s;hall now give, in a few Words, the Quinte&s;&s;ence of this Play. Monarchs ought to be ju&s;t. Heroes are bad Men. Hu&s;bands ought to die for their Wives, Wives for their Hu&s;bands. We ought to govern our Pa&s;&s;ions. And the Sun &s;hines on all alike. A few of the&s;e new Remarks form the Sum total of this contemptible Piece.</P>
<P>After the Play we were entertain|ed with an Epilogue fraught with Humour, and &s;poken with Spirit. There was a Simile of a Bundle of Twigs formed into a Rod, which &s;eemed to convey a delicate Allu&s;ion to Mr. <HI>Malloch</HI>'s original Profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;ome of the Lines contained an exqui&s;ite and &s;evere Critici&s;m on the Play it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="20">
Amid&s;t all the har&s;hne&s;s in&s;pired by a real Feeling of the Dulne&s;s of the Compo&s;ition it&s;elf, it would be unju&s;t not to be&s;tow the highe&s;t Ap|plau&s;e on the principal Performers, by the Energy of who&s;e Action even Dulne&s;s was &s;ometimes rendered re&s;pectable. We were &s;orry to find &s;uch great Talents &s;o very ill em|ployed. The melting Tones of a <HI>Cibber</HI> &s;hould make every Eye &s;tream with Tears. <HI>Pritchard</HI> &s;hould al|ways elevate. <HI>Garrick</HI> give Strength and Maje&s;ty to the Scene. Let us &s;often at the keen Di&s;tre&s;s of a <HI>Belvidera;</HI> let our Souls ri&s;e with the Dignity of an <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> let us tremble at the wild Madne&s;s of a
<PB N="24" REF="21">
<HI>Lear;</HI> but let us not Yawn at the Stupidity of unintere&s;ting Cha|racters.</P>
