<HEAD>LETTER FROM A FRIEND TO THE AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you de&s;ire my opinion of your Letters from Snowdon, which you intend to publi&s;h, it is a duty I owe to friend&s;hip to give it with freedom and impartiality. With|out de&s;cending to a minute critici&s;m on par|ticular pa&s;&s;ages, I &s;hall ob&s;erve in general upon the &s;ub&s;tance of the work, and the manner in which it is written.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing the manners and cu&s;toms of the inhabitants, you repre&s;ent them as a &s;trange compound of virtue and vice. You
<PB REF="3">
de&s;cribe the country as uncultivated, and the inhabitants in an inferior degree of civiliza|tion than the Engli&s;h. However ju&s;t your ob&s;ervations and de&s;cription may be, yet the people of that country at lea&s;t will think, that the picture is not a true repre&s;entation of them. It will be well if you do not meet with a Fluellin, who will oblige you to un|dergo the puni&s;hment inflicted on ancient Pi&s;tol, by eating the leek, and you may be compelled as ignominiou&s;ly to &s;ay,
<Q>Quiet thy cudgel, thou do&s;t &s;ee I eat it.</Q></P>
<P>The a&s;perity with which you have, in &s;ome places, treated the country, is not the only reprehen&s;ible part of your letters. Your work contains &s;ome moral reflections, con|trary to the received opinions of mankind. Add to the&s;e objections, that your letters are written with &s;o much negligence, inequality, and inaccuracy of &s;tile, that you mu&s;t expect the abu&s;e of malevolence, and the &s;courge of critici&s;m.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">If you had &s;tudied to plea&s;e the ta&s;te of the public, your work ought to have abound|ed, in imitation of the modern compo&s;itions, with antithe&s;es, abrupt tran&s;itions, and what the fa&s;hionable writers and readers call Sen|timent. However difficult it may be to ex|plain what is meant by the word Sentiment; yet is it e&s;teemed the criterion of merit by which every modern publication is judged. Sermons, plays, poetry, hi&s;tory, mu&s;t all have enough of this ingredient to plea&s;e the public. It is the fa&s;hionable Sal Atticum, which ren|ders the compo&s;ition palatable.</P>
<P>As you have de&s;ired my opinion, you mu&s;t excu&s;e the freedom with which I give it. And I &s;incerely wi&s;h the public judgment may prove more favorable than that of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your friend and &s;ervant, &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>ANSWER TO THE FOREGOING LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN an author can bear with patience to hear his writings cen&s;ured, he gains a vic|tory over his vanity. My obligations are due to you even for the &s;evere cen&s;ure your letter contains, as it will prepare me for the public opinion, unfavorable as it may prove. You will allow me however to &s;ay &s;omething in vindication of what you have treated with &s;o much &s;everity.</P>
<P>I did not &s;it down to draw a caricature, nor to decorate the object with beauties which it had not. However deformed a portrait may be, if it is like the per&s;on for whom it was intended, the painter is ju&s;tified. In de|lineating the manners and cu&s;toms of the country, their virtues are painted as well as vices; and in neither is there a deviation from
<PB REF="6">
truth. In whatever they have merited prai&s;e, I have gladly &s;eized the opportunity of doing them ju&s;tice; and, whenever it has fallen within my province to cen&s;ure, it is done with decency and candor.</P>
<P>Your ob&s;ervations on my language and &s;tile, may perhaps be better founded; I freely own that they are not written with labored accuracy. I have &s;tudied neither &s;entiment nor wit. Cla&s;&s;ical purity con&s;i&s;ts in ea&s;e and per&s;picuity; not in labored &s;entences, and an affected rotundity of period, which &s;eems to be the pre&s;ent fa&s;hionable mode of writing. A modern reader would not he&s;itate to prefer the &s;tile and manner of Seneca, to the pure&s;t writer in the Augu&s;tan age.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e letters are upon &s;ubjects of importance to the principality of Wales; and have been written with a view to engage the attention of &s;uch as are concerned. The re&s;t of the&s;e epi&s;tolary ob&s;ervations were written to friends for amu&s;ement only; and their pub|lication may be le&s;s owing to the author's va|nity, than their reque&s;t.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">Secure of candor, if not indulgence, no apology &s;hall be made for their publication. Though an entertainment cannot be provided agreeable to every ta&s;te, yet I &s;hall continue to hope, that mo&s;t readers will find &s;ome gra|tification for their amu&s;ement or curio&s;ity in the peru&s;al of the&s;e letters.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE no rea&s;on to regret the length of my journey. It has been embelli&s;hed with &s;uch an infinite diver&s;ity of objects, &s;o enchanting to one who&s;e pro&s;pects have been confined to the unvariegated &s;cenes of nature. Unattended and unadorned by her handmaid art, &s;he appears without deceit in all her native charms. Sometimes in the gay
<PB N="2" REF="13">
attire of fertile vales and woods, or in the plainer dre&s;s of mountains, cataracts and craggy precipices; more beautiful by change, and more plea&s;ing by variety.</P>
<P>Since I have left the bu&s;y &s;cenes of life, I have now the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;ending you the promi&s;ed account of my tour into this country. I will omit no circum&s;tance that fell within my ob&s;ervation, which I &s;hall think may prove either curious or enter|taining.</P>
<P>In a journey of three days from the me|tropolis, I arrived at Che&s;ter, on the banks of the river Dee. The ca&s;tle, which &s;eems to have been curious neither for elegance or &s;trength, is in a ruinous condition. The walls of the town are in good repair. There is a plea&s;ant walk upon them, from whence we have an exten&s;ive circular pro&s;|pect. Here we had a di&s;tant view of the Wel&s;h mountains, tho&s;e natural fortre&s;&s;es which &s;o long &s;ecured the independence of the inhabitants. The&s;e made a formidable appearance to one who intended &s;o &s;oon to
<PB N="3" REF="14">
&s;cale their craggy &s;ummits. The pro&s;pect we had from hence was a perfect contra&s;t. On one &s;ide, the beautiful vales of Che&s;hire, clad in all the blooming verdure of &s;pring; on the other, the Cambrian hills &s;till wearing the hoary garb of winter.</P>
<P>Che&s;ter was anciently the re&s;idence of the kings of Wales. Its &s;ituation on the fron|tiers of England and Wales was mo&s;t conve|nient to repel the incur&s;ions of the Saxons. In the ancient Briti&s;h language it is called CAER<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All the derivations of the Wel&s;h words, which the reader will find in the following pages, are in&s;erted upon the authority of a gentleman conver&s;ant in the language.</NOTE>, which &s;ignifies a walled or fortified place; from whence, or the Latin word Ca&s;trum, its pre&s;umed, the pre&s;ent name is derived. Long after the Britons, or Wel&s;h, were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of England, by the Saxons, they &s;till retained great part of the level country, on the borders of Wales, which was part of Mercia, afterwards called the marches of Wales.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="15">The marches of Wales comprehended the greate&s;t part of the counties of Che&s;ter, Salop, Hereford, and Worce&s;ter. They were claimed both by the Saxons and the Britons; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by either, as the fortune of war prevailed. They were the &s;cenes of conti|nual wars and deva&s;tation. It was the wi&s;e policy of the times to give large e&s;tates to men of di&s;tingui&s;hed valour, to pre&s;erve the frontier counties from rapine and violence, who were called lords-marchers. They had great numbers of men under their command, who &s;wore fealty to them, and were under their direction upon all occa&s;ions. Their power was &s;o great, that they might rather be con&s;idered as petty princes than &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Egbert<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid of Egbert, that he was rowed on the river Dee by nine kings.</NOTE>, who reduced the Saxton heptar|chy, took Che&s;ter from the princes of Wales. Since which time it has always been accounted as part of England. In the time of king Offa, the Wel&s;h lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of the marches. With a view either to prevent
<PB N="5" REF="16">
their incur&s;ions, into their frontier counties, or to mark the boundaries, he made a great dyke, called Offa's dyke (in the Briti&s;h lan|guage CLAUDH Offa) which is remaining in many places at this time. This was built probably with the &s;ame intent as the great wall between England and Scotland, and that between China and Tartary. Offa's dyke extends from the river Dee at Che&s;ter to the Wye at Chep&s;tow. Its direction gives us rea&s;on to think it was intended to confine the Wel&s;h to the mountains, as its general cour&s;e runs on the &s;ides of the hills.</P>
<P>The character of the inhabitants of North Wales, the Ordovices of the Romans, was even by the te&s;timony of their ene|mies, that of a brave and warlike people. They pre&s;erved their independence for cen|turies, again&s;t the continued attempts of a great and powerful people to &s;ubdue them. Whether this may with greater propriety be attributed to their natural bravery, to the &s;ituation of their country, or to their want of
<PB N="6" REF="17">
&s;uch things as tempt the ambition of con|querors, I &s;hall leave undecided. Certain however, it is, that the Saxons continually made the greate&s;t efforts to conquer them. In&s;tigated, perhaps, more by a principle of revenge, for the ravages they committed on the borders of England, than by any advan|tages they could derive from the conque&s;t of &s;uch a country.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, they were in an almo&s;t uninterrupted &s;tate of war. Such an innate principle of enmity and antipathy &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two nations, that the cruelties perpetrated by either &s;ide (as the chance of war decided) equalled tho&s;e of the mo&s;t &s;avage nations. This enmity is traditional, and the common people in a great degree retain it inveterate to this day. Whenever they &s;peak of an Engli&s;hman, whom they &s;till call Saes or Saxon, they always join &s;ome opprobious epithet.</P>
<P>It is not certain at what time the Britons were fir&s;t called by the name of Wel&s;h, nor
<PB N="7" REF="18">
from whence the word has its derivation. Some hi&s;torians &s;ay that Wallia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wales (Wallia) cometh of the Saxon WEALH, which &s;ignifies peregrinus, for the Saxons &s;o called them, for in troth they were &s;trangers to them, being the remains of the old and ancient Britons, a wi&s;e and warlike nation inhabiting the we&s;t of England. Vide Lambert. This derivation &s;eems not improbable, and it may be remarked in confirmation of it, that WEALT &s;ignifies in the Wel&s;h, barbarous or wild.</NOTE> comes from Italia, as the Britons were de&s;cendants of Eneas. Others that Wel&s;h come from Gauli&s;h, as they were de&s;cended from the Gauls. Nothing is more uncertain than etymological learning; e&s;pecially if we have no other foundation than &s;imilarity of &s;ound. It is the di&s;grace of &s;cience. I &s;hall not ri&s;k even a conjecture upon the &s;ubject. From whatever origin, the word Wel&s;h may be de|rived, it is not unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e it to be a term of reproach, fixed on them by the Saxons, as they never call them&s;elves by that name, but always Cymry. Some likewi&s;e are weak enough to derive the word Cymry from Cimbri, imagining that they originally
<PB N="8" REF="19">
de&s;cended from that people. All the&s;e derivations I look upon as vague and groundle&s;s conjectures. I chu&s;e to avoid adopting any &s;uch; for in my opinion the names of different nations are generally more owing to ca&s;ual events, than they are de&s;crip|tive of either their de&s;cent or country.</P>
<P>In a future letter I propo&s;e &s;ending you &s;ome hi&s;torical account of this people.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>YOU may with ju&s;tice, my dear friend, complain of my la&s;t letter. It con|tained ob&s;ervations on &s;ubjects unimportant and unentertaining to the greate&s;t number of readers. Have patience, Sir, a reader mu&s;t &s;ometimes, like a traveller, put up with bad as well as good accommodations; if the landlord does his endeavor to plea&s;e, his gue&s;t ought to be &s;atisfied. If the fir&s;t &s;tage is but indifferent, he mu&s;t pur&s;ue his journey patiently, in hopes of better entertainment at the next.</P>
<P>At Che&s;ter we provided our&s;elves with the nece&s;&s;ary equipment of a Wel&s;h poney; and procured a guide, who likewi&s;e &s;erved us in
<PB N="10" REF="21">
the capacity of an interpreter. We &s;et out from Che&s;ter ruminating on our intended tour, and forming in our imaginations as many dangers and difficulties, as Hannibal met with in cro&s;&s;ing the Alps. We were however agreeably deceived in our fir&s;t day's journey, for we had an extraordinary good road; and in about three hours, we came to Holy-well. As we travelled, we had a pro&s;|pect of the town and ca&s;tle of Flint, with the ca&s;tle of Haywarden, and the &s;eat of Sir John Glynne; neither of which, in my opini|on, merit a particular de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Holy-well, or as it's called in the Briti&s;h language TRE-FYNNON, i. e. the town of the well; is a neat &s;mall town, &s;ituated on the &s;ide of a hill. At the bottom of which is the famous well of St. Winifred, from whence the town derives its name. The well is &s;ur|rounded with very high hills on every &s;ide, to which may be attributed the amazing &s;pring of water. It flows, according to the relati|on of the inhabitants, at the rate of a ton a minute. All the miraculous powers of heal|ing
<PB N="11" REF="22">
attributed to the&s;e waters, are a&s;cribed to their patrone&s;s St. Winifred. So great is the veneration in which &s;he is held, by tho&s;e of the Romi&s;h per&s;ua&s;ion, that in honor of her, they to this day, perform pilgrimages to Holy-well. You would not excu&s;e me, were I to relate to you all the &s;trange &s;tories re|corded of St. Winifred, by the monki&s;h legendary writers. The&s;e &s;erve only to &s;hew the &s;uper&s;tition of tho&s;e times, and create di&s;gu&s;t in a modern reader.</P>
<P>From Holy-well we travelled through a very indifferent road to Rhyddlan, a mi&s;e|rable village, &s;ituated on the borders of a very exten&s;ive mar&s;h. The only thing for which it is remarkable, is a ca&s;tle built by Henry II. The ca&s;tle is exten&s;ive, not well &s;ituated, nor con&s;tructed with ta&s;te or elegance, and &s;eems to have been &s;tronger by art than nature. It is more decayed, than the gene|rality of ca&s;tles built in Wales about the &s;ame period. Some authors of con&s;iderable repute have a&s;&s;erted, that the ca&s;tle of Rhyd|dlan was built by Edward I. as well as tho&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="23">
of Carnarvon, Conway and Beaumaris. It is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e, for its &s;truc|ture is exceedingly different from tho&s;e which he built. The rea&s;on that the Statutum Walliae, or the ordinances re&s;pecting Wales, were enacted at Rhyddlan, was mo&s;t pro|bably owing to the other ca&s;tles not being then fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The fertile vale of Clwyd, extends from Rhyddlan-mar&s;h to the town of Rhythin, which is about fifteen miles. It is one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fertile vales in the whole kingdom. It has three con&s;iderable towns, St. A&s;aph, Denbigh and Rhythin. The former is not remarked for beauty or &s;itua|tion. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and has a good cathedral.</P>
<P>Denbigh is &s;ituated upon a fine eminence, on which ari&s;e the turrets of a maje&s;tic ca&s;tle. It is in ruins, but the very ruins are vene|rable. Great part of the hall is &s;till &s;tand|ing, which the rude inhabitants mi&s;take for the ruins of a church. The remains of the hall, give the traveller an idea of the gran|deur
<PB N="13" REF="24">
of the place. I do not find by whom this ca&s;tle was built, but I conjecture Wil|liam Rufus, as he &s;ent a colony to Denbigh|land.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect from the ca&s;tle is mo&s;t en|chanting. Beneath, the vale of Clwyd di&s;|plays her bo&s;om, profu&s;ely gay to the admir|ing &s;pectator. The banks of the river Clwyd decorated with &s;eats, the towns of Rhythin and St. A&s;aph, with the mountains ri&s;ing at a di&s;tance, form a mo&s;t delightful view.</P>
<P>Rhythin is a more populous and opulent town than Denbigh, and con&s;i&s;ts of better hou&s;es; but in point of &s;ituation, is far in|ferior. There are here the ruins of a ca&s;tle, but &s;o much defaced by the hand of time, that nothing can be di&s;cerned, which attracts the notice of a traveller.</P>
<P>The counties of Denbigh and Flint are rich and populous. The low country is very fertile, and in mo&s;t places well cultivated and improved. The Engli&s;h manners and cu&s;toms are pretty much adopted, e&s;pecially
<PB N="14" REF="25">
by the inhabitants of the vale country, who &s;eem to be in general of Saxon and Norman extraction, as appears by tho&s;e names being common in that country. Great part of Flint&s;hire was very early in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h; and Denbigh-land, in the vale of Clwyd, was likewi&s;e colonied by &s;ome of the fir&s;t princes of the Norman line.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the mountainous coun|try &s;till retain the ancient Briti&s;h language and cu&s;toms, unadulterated with any foreign tongue. So great is the difference between the inhabitants of the mountains and the vales, that they would be taken to be natives of different countries and climates. Different not only in their manners and cu&s;toms, but even in their very complexion and per&s;ons.</P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed the ob&s;ervations I made in my tour through the counties of Flint and Denbigh.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE character of the ancient inhabi|tants of this country, is given us in very unfavorable terms, by many hi&s;torians. The Engli&s;h in tho&s;e times were almo&s;t always in a &s;tate of war with this people, and were bia&s;&s;ed by their intere&s;t and pa&s;&s;ions to repre|&s;ent them in the mo&s;t odious colours. Giraldus Cambren&s;is, who&s;e connections and de&s;cent might have prejudiced him in favour of this country, failed not to pay court to Henry II. by traducing the Wel&s;h. What is &s;till more extraordinary, the accurate and inge|nious lord Lyttleton, has implicitly adopted
<PB N="16" REF="27">
the character given of them by the fal&s;e and infamous Giraldus. They are repre&s;ented by the&s;e hi&s;torians, as having no kind idea of cha&s;tity. Promi&s;cuous concubinage, they &s;ay, was in a manner allowed, and no &s;tigma fixed upon it. If my lord Lyttleton had con&s;ulted Howel Dha's code, he would there have &s;een how highly they di&s;approved of even the appearances of an unlawful com|merce between the &s;exes. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe only one pa&s;&s;age, which fully proves what I have &s;aid. <Q REND="inline">"Si faemina convicta fuerit cri|minis turpis cum alieno viro patrati, nempe o&s;culationis, vel contractationis, vel adulterii, viro &s;uo licet illam repudiare, et illa omittet dotem integram &s;ibi primitus a viro &s;uo a&s;&s;ig|natam, &s;i tantum exo&s;culata fuerit, &s;i a caeteris ab&s;it."</Q> By the &s;ame laws, if a man betrothed a woman, who did not prove to be a virgin, he was at liberty to repudiate her. Thus we &s;ee how cautiou&s;ly the Wel&s;h laws guarded the morals of the women, and how unju&s;tly they were accu&s;ed by Giraldus, and tho&s;e that have a&s;&s;erted the &s;ame on his authority.
<PB N="17" REF="28">
The manners of every uncivilized nation are in &s;ome degree &s;imilar. Sixteen hundred years ago, the inhabitants of Wales were nearly in the &s;ame &s;tate of civilization, as the American &s;avages are at this day. We are told of Jo&s;eph of Arimethea's coming to Britain to plant the go&s;pel. This depends upon the authority of the monki&s;h hi&s;torians, who &s;carce contain a word of truth or proba|bility. But it is allowed that &s;ome kind of Chri&s;tianity was planted very early in Britain, before the coming of the Saxons. Long after the Saxons came over they continued Pagans; whil&s;t the Britons, according to the&s;e hi&s;torians, enjoyed the light of the go&s;pel. Before the&s;e Britons were converted to Chri&s;tianity, one would think it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to convert them from &s;avages to men. From the accounts that I have read, by their conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity, no more is meant than their being bapti&s;ed, without &s;o much as the imparting of any kind of faith or knowledge.

<PB N="18" REF="29">
of the conver&s;ion of thou&s;ands, who have only been ceremoniou&s;ly bapti&s;ed, without Chri&s;tian in&s;truction.</P>
<P>In the time of Henry II. the inhabitants of Wales were &s;o deplorably dark, that they could not with the lea&s;t propriety be called Chri&s;tians, and many of them even profe&s;&s;ed Pagans. The Don-Quixot archbi&s;hop, with his Sancho-Pancha, Giraldus, went upon an expedition to convert the&s;e Heathens. The archbi&s;hop preached to the poor Wel&s;h in latin, they were bapti&s;ed, ki&s;&s;ed the cro&s;s, and &s;o the mi&s;&s;ion ended, to their no &s;mall edification.</P>
<P>So late as the reign of Elizabeth, if we may believe Penry, there were but two or three that could preach in the whole princi|pality of Wales. Some of late years have greatly promoted the cau&s;e of religion, by the tran&s;lation of pious books into that lan|guage, and di&s;tributing them among the poor. There is &s;till great room for improv|ment, as they are not only in want, but de&s;irous of religious knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="30">In former times, the inhabitants of Wales were de&s;cribed to be a nation of &s;ol|diers. Every man being obliged to take up arms, in times of di&s;tre&s;s. Thus, though a &s;mall country, they could bring large armies to the field. They u&s;ed very light-armour, as they carried on the war by incur|&s;ions, and forced marches; and conquered their enemies rather by &s;urpri&s;e, than &s;trength or courage.</P>
<P>They had only a &s;mall target to defend their brea&s;t, and u&s;ed the javelin as a weapon of offence. Thus armed, and thus defended, they were no way equal to the Engli&s;h in a pitched battle, who fought with heavy ar|mour, helmets and targets, and armed at all points.</P>
<P>They always fought on foot. Like all undi&s;ciplined &s;oldiers, they made one furious on&s;et, which if re&s;i&s;ted, they were immedi|ately put in confu&s;ion, and could not be ral|lied. They fled to the mountains, where they waited for another opportunity to fall upon their enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="31">They de&s;pi&s;ed trade and mechanical arts, as they in general do to this day. Though they had no money among them, yet there were no beggars in the country for they were all poor. They are de&s;cribed to have been impetuous in their di&s;po&s;ition, fickle, revenge|ful, and bloody. But let it be remembered, that this character is given them by their enemies.</P>
<P>Their &s;uper&s;tition was exce&s;&s;ive. They paid the greate&s;t veneration to their prie&s;ts, and looked upon them and their habitations as &s;acred.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a former letter, I gave you a de&s;crip|tion of my journey from Che&s;ter to Den|bigh; permit me now, Sir, to proceed in the account of my tour.</P>
<P>From Denbigh, we travelled through a hilly country, till we arrived at Conway, which is about twenty-five miles di&s;tant. Conway ca&s;tle was built by Edward I. and is the admiration of all that &s;ee it. For &s;ituation, elegance, &s;trength and grandeur it is perhaps unrivalled. It is &s;ituated on a high rock above the &s;ea, and moated on the land &s;ide. There are ten round towers in the
<PB N="22" REF="33">
ca&s;tle, and four turrets that are con&s;iderably higher than the towers. The walls are bat|tlemented, and are from twelve to fifteen feet in breadth. When we enter into the ca&s;tle, we are &s;truck with the view of a grand arched hall, with hand&s;ome niched windows. This hall is entire; it is a hundred feet long, thirty wide, and thirty high, and the roof &s;upported by nine arches of &s;tone. The ex|ternal part of the ca&s;tle remains entire, as in Edward I. time, except one tower, which has tumbled into the &s;ea, by part of the rock giving way. On one &s;ide of the ca&s;tle is a high hill, covered with a fine coppice of wood. On the other we have a pro&s;pect over the river of &s;ome con&s;iderable &s;eats, which make a beautiful appearance. The whole town is &s;urrounded by a wall; and &s;o &s;trongly fortified was this place, that before the invention of cannon, it mu&s;t have been ab&s;olutely impregnable.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit acquainting you, that the inns at Conway, are the wor&s;t and mo&s;t ex|travagant upon this road; which hint may
<PB N="23" REF="34">
be of &s;ervice to you, in ca&s;e you &s;hould travel this way.</P>
<P>The town of Llanrw&s;t is about ten miles di&s;tant from Conway, the road to it leads through a beautiful little vale, environed by mountains that &s;cale the heavens.</P>
<P>Llanrw&s;t contains nothing remarkable, except a bridge built by Inigo Jones. This town claims the honor of being the place of his nativity. The elegant &s;tructure of the bridge, leaves us no room to doubt the ma&s;terly hand of the architect.</P>
<P>From Conway we pa&s;&s;ed over that &s;tupen|dous rock, called Penmaenmawr. The road pa&s;&s;es along the &s;ide of the mountain. Both beneath and above the road there are horrid precipices, with fragments of rock impend|ing over the terrified traveller. Such roads appear tremendous, to one who has been u&s;ed to travel a level country; but the inha|bitants make nothing of riding on the very brink of a precipice. After a thaw of &s;now, or a heavy fall of rain, the loo&s;e rocks &s;ome|times give way, and roll with convul&s;ive ruins
<PB N="24" REF="35">
into the &s;ea, carrying with them the wall built for the traveller's &s;ecurity. A con&s;iderable part of this wall was thrown down, when we pa&s;&s;ed. It is &s;aid that a road is &s;oon to be built under the mountain, through the &s;ea, for which two thou&s;and pound, I am informed, is granted by parliament.</P>
<P>Such as travel from Che&s;ter to Holy-head, &s;ometimes go by a place called Bwlch-y-ddau-fain, thereby avoiding Conway and Penma|enmawr. This is nearer by &s;ix or eight miles, but an exceeding bad mountainous road, and which I would not advi&s;e the tra|veller to take.</P>
<P>Bangor is about twenty miles di&s;tant from Conway. At low water, we have a plea&s;ant ride over the &s;ands. It is a &s;mall town agreeably &s;ituated in a little vale, there was anciently a friary near this town, where the monks retired from Bangor-I&s;&s;a-coed in Den|bigh&s;hire upon the ma&s;&s;acre. The remains of the friary are converted into a free gram|mar &s;chool, which is pretty well endowed, and is in a very flouri&s;hing &s;tate. It is &s;aid
<PB N="25" REF="36">
that the famous Owen Glendowr was buried in this cathedral, and his grave is &s;hewn there at this time.</P>
<P>The town of Carnarvon, &s;o called from its &s;ituation CAER AR-FON, i. e. a walled town, oppo&s;ite Angle&s;ey, is about eight miles from Bangor, and &s;tands plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the banks of the Menai. It has a noble ca&s;tle, built by Edward I. where his queen was brought to bed of Edward II. They &s;hew the queen's bed-chamber to all traveller's that vi&s;it this ca&s;tle. It is built in the Roman &s;tile of architecture; it has one tower emi|nent above the re&s;t called the Eagle's tour, from an eagle carved upon it. The town is &s;urrounded by a wall, and &s;eems to have been well fortified for tho&s;e days. I have heard it remarked that there are few gentlemen, but a great number of widow's that live here. In this country the women in general &s;urvive the men, and the rea&s;on of it does not &s;eem to be very problematical.</P>

<P>VIRTUE, my dear friend, is not the inhabitant of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whoever denies this po&s;ition, let him read the ac|count of the Hottentots, the Tartars, and the &s;avages of A&s;ia and America, when fir&s;t di&s;covered.</NOTE> uncivilized countries. She is not confined to &s;cenes of &s;olitude, nor always found in the unfrequented vales of rural retirement. Virtue is a plant that flouri&s;hes not in the untoward &s;oil of nature uncivilized; and is often more an exotic in a country village, than in the crouded &s;treets of populous cities.</P>
<P>The innocence of manners de&s;cribed by the poets, in the primaeval ages of mankind, had exi&s;tence only in their own imagination.
<PB N="27" REF="38">
Man in a natural &s;tate, has no other de&s;ire or thought but the gratification of his wants. He feels only the impul&s;es of nature, and yields to tho&s;e feelings. If we my define virtue to be a re&s;i&s;tance, in a certain degree, to the force of our natural propen&s;ities; he knows not, nor acknowledges any &s;uch power. Nature alone is his empre&s;s, he feels her &s;way, and pays obedience to her commands.</P>
<P>The ideas of beauty and merit, the one ari&s;ing from per&s;onal, the other from mental accompli&s;hments, depend upon ab&s;tract rea|&s;onings, and compari&s;ons formed in the mind. The farther we are removed from a &s;tate of civilization, the le&s;s capable are we of form|ing the&s;e ideas. Love, therefore, in its re|fined &s;tate, kindled by the flame of beauty, and founded on the &s;olid ba&s;is of per&s;onal merit, mu&s;t con&s;equently be peculiarly the characteri&s;tic of civilized nations. Hence the very meaning of the term, con&s;idered as the tender &s;ympathy of congenial &s;ouls, is never known in many countries. The A&s;iatics, Africans, Americans and Dutch, are altoge|ther
<PB N="28" REF="39">
&s;trangers to any &s;uch idea. They car fix no other &s;ignification to the word love than that pa&s;&s;ion which nature wi&s;ely im|planted in all animals, preventive of the an|nihilation of their &s;pecies. They have no predilection for any object. The per&s;on is no con&s;ideration with them. If the end na|ture had in view is an&s;wered, they are &s;atis|fied. Thus they avoid all tho&s;e inquietudes ari&s;ing from per&s;onal predilection, the proli|fic &s;ource of jealou&s;ies and animo&s;ities, which di&s;turb the peace of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations may not be altogether inapplicable to the people, who&s;e manners I am de&s;cribing. I do not find that either of the &s;exes are capable of forming any violent attachment, or per&s;onal affection. All are to them indifferent, except where fortuitous external cau&s;es have de&s;troyed their equality.</P>
<P>In all countries cu&s;tom has e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ome forms, previous to connubial, connec|tions. In many places, cu&s;tom acts the part of an inexorable tyrant, who&s;e rigid com|mands we mu&s;t implicitly obey. Here &s;he
<PB N="29" REF="40">
bears a milder &s;way. I will not offend the ear of delicacy, with a de&s;cription of what had better be concealed. I may &s;ay, that in general the women di&s;cover &s;uch progno&s;tics, before they enter into the marriage &s;tate, as denote they will not be unfruitful members of &s;ociety. Nor does cu&s;tom &s;tamp the opprobious &s;tig|ma of infamy upon &s;uch an appearance.</P>
<P>The ceremonies attending the marriages of the&s;e people, may afford you &s;ome enter|tainment, as they are different from any thing of the kind, that may have fallen within your ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The bridegroom on the morning of the wedding, accompanied with a troop of his friends, as well equipped as the country will allow, comes and demands the bride. Her friends, who are likewi&s;e well mounted on their MERLINS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Wel&s;h word for a little mountain hor&s;e.</NOTE>, give a po&s;itive refu&s;al to their demands, whereupon a mock &s;cuffle en&s;ues between the parties. The bride is mounted on one of the be&s;t &s;teeds, behind
<PB N="30" REF="41">her next kin&s;man, who rides away with her in full career. The bridegroom and his friends, pur&s;ue them with loud &s;houts. It is not uncommon to &s;ee, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, two or three hundred of the&s;e merlins, mounted by &s;turdy Cambro-Britons, riding with full &s;peed, cro&s;&s;ing and jo&s;tling each other, to the no &s;mall amu&s;ement of the &s;pectators. When they have pretty well fatigued them&s;elves and their hor&s;es, the bridegroom is permitted to overtake his bride. He leads her away in triumph, as the Ro|mans did the Sabine nymphs. They all re|turn in amity, and the whole is concluded with fe&s;tivity and mirth.</P>
<P>Let us now view the women, in the very e&s;&s;ential characters of wives and mothers. You would naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that a young woman who had, wihtout fear or re&s;traint, enjoyed an almo&s;t unbounded liberty in a &s;ingle &s;tate, would not be ea&s;ily debarred from enjoying the &s;ame in the married. But the ca&s;e is the very rever&s;e. Infidelity to the bed of Hymen, is &s;care ever known or heard
<PB N="31" REF="42">
of in this country. Adultery is a weed that grows in the rank &s;oil of a court, fo&s;tered by luxury and vanity.</P>
<P>Mankind form an untrue judgment from external appearances; tho&s;e are e&s;teemed virtuous, who have had their education in a boarding &s;chool or nunnery. Per&s;uaded I am, the ca&s;e is quite different. The greater number of &s;hackles with which we fetter human nature, the more &s;he &s;trives to gain her native freedom. Forbidden plea&s;ures are coveted, whil&s;t tho&s;e within our reach are neglected. The various methods of confinement in foreign countries, makes their ta&s;te for illicit plea&s;ures more poignant, and incites them to run ri&s;ks for their gratifica|tion. When you indulge them in the power, you in &s;ome degree take away the temptation to vice.</P>
<P>In the character of wives, the women of this country are laborious, indu&s;trious and cha&s;te. In that of mothers, they nurture their robu&s;t offspring, not in &s;loth and inacti|vity,
<PB N="32" REF="43">
but enure them early to undergo hard|&s;hips and fatigues.</P>
<P>Let the fair daughters of indolence and ea&s;e, contemplate the characters of the&s;e patterns of indu&s;try, who are happily unac|quainted with the gay follies of life. Who enjoy health without medicine, and happi|ne&s;s without affluence. Equally remote from the grandeur and the mi&s;eries of life, they participate of the &s;weet ble&s;&s;ings of content, under the homely dwelling of a &s;traw-built cottage.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN giving a general de&s;cription of the manners of this country, I would always, be under&s;tood to except many individuals, who happily cannot be included under the general character. During my conti|nuance here, I have met with &s;ome po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of every virtue that can adorn humanity. Such as do honor to human nature, in all countries, are but few, when compared to tho&s;e that di&s;grace it. Here the number is not le&s;s proportionate.</P>
<P>However my re&s;pect for a few individuals, might incline me to &s;peak partially of the
<PB N="34" REF="45">
country. The &s;acred regard I bear to the cau&s;e of truth, &s;tops my pen. She com|mands me to repre&s;ent them as they are,
<Q>Nothing extenuate, nor &s;et down ought in malice.</Q></P>
<P>The country gentlemen in England, or rather let me &s;ay e&s;quires; an appellation they e&s;teem more honorable, and I own more &s;uitable; have been generally repre|&s;ented, not unju&s;tly, as a &s;et of beings, who have no other employment, or diver&s;ion, ex|cept that of the chace and the gla&s;s. They &s;pend the whole morning in the one, and the evening in the other. Without learning and without knowledge, their minds like their e&s;tates lie fallow and unimproved. The en|tertainment of the animal is their only bu&s;i|ne&s;s, while the man is neglected. The fable of the centaurs is literally verified in this cla&s;s of beings, for the bea&s;t runs away with the man. As the objects of their attention are confined, &s;o are their ideas, and the to|pics of their conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="46">I will not &s;ay the '&s;quires in Wales, differ materially from tho&s;e of the &s;ame rank in England, except that they are more devoted to the jolly god. For like the Thracians of old, when a &s;tranger comes among them, they will do him the honors of the hou&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In every hou&s;e that I vi&s;ited in Wales, they had a capacious horn, or other enormous uten&s;il, which they obliged every man to drink that came, filled with CWRW, the Wel&s;h word for &s;trong ale.</NOTE>, by obliging him to drink intemperately; and will at lea&s;t expect him to make a com|pliment of his rea&s;on, in return for their ho&s;pitality. They have, however, &s;ome good qualities, in a greater degree than the Engli&s;h. They keep better hou&s;es, employ a greater number of poor, are le&s;s avaritious, and far more charitable.</P>
<P>The clergy are in general the only people that have any knowledge of letters; to qua|lify them for orders, they have the advantage of a good &s;chool education; and &s;pend a con&s;iderable time at the univer&s;ity. It is the general, and I believe well founded, com|plaint
<PB N="36" REF="47">
of the country, that they return from thence very little improved, in their morals or learning. A certain air of pedantry, ac|companied with vain a&s;&s;urance, and the ac|qui&s;ition of &s;ome fa&s;hionable vices, are too often the only means of di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;uch as have had an univer&s;ity education.</P>
<P>An academy, under proper regulations, in the country would, I think, be a more &s;uitable place for in&s;tructing youth for the church. It would be attended with le&s;s ex|pence, and greater care might be taken of their morals and religion, the principal object.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the clergy have two or three churches each to &s;erve, and con&s;equently it is impo&s;&s;ible the duty &s;hould be properly di&s;charged. Evening prayers are &s;eldom read, and in many places they &s;carce ever preach. The benefices are for the mo&s;t part of pretty con&s;iderable value, being a decent maintainence for a clergyman. Except in a few towns, and on the borders of England, the &s;ervice of their churches is performed altogether in the Wel&s;h or old Briti&s;h tongue.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="48">The yeomanry and pea&s;ants are very civil and obliging in their behavior. They have not the ferocious di&s;po&s;ition, which charac|teri&s;es the Engli&s;h, flowing from that &s;pirit of liberty and independence, which animates the &s;oul of an Engli&s;hman. They are &s;hrewd and artful in their dealings. They have an inveterate rooted antipathy to all foreigners, e&s;pecially Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h. If a &s;tranger is &s;o unfortunate as to go and live among&s;t them, they look upon him with a jealous eye, as one who comes with an intent to deprive them of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>The manner of living of the lower cla&s;s of people, is extremely poor. The chief of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, being barley and oat bread. They &s;carce ever eat fle&s;h, or drink any thing but milk. They are not of that pa&s;&s;ionate and choleric temper, as the Engli&s;h de&s;cribe them, but &s;low, deliberate, and wary in their &s;peech and conduct, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive in their di&s;po&s;ition. I know not whether to attribute it to their manner of life, or
<PB N="38" REF="49">
to the great power the '&s;quires exerci&s;e over them. Certain it is, that the people of this country in general, have no greater idea of Engli&s;h liberty than the pea&s;ants of France.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my two la&s;t letters, I endeavoured to give you &s;ome idea of the manners of this people; I &s;hall re&s;erve the di&s;agreeable ta&s;k of fini&s;hing the portrait, till another opportunity. Let us now vary our &s;ubject, and contemplate the face of nature; which however rugged her appearance may be, af|fords a more plea&s;ing pro&s;pect, than the rude and uninformed heart of man.</P>
<P>From Carnarvon&s;hire, we cro&s;&s;ed over the Menai, into the i&s;land of Angle&s;ea. It is called the river Menai, though in fact it is an arm of the &s;ea, &s;eperating Angle&s;ea from
<PB N="40" REF="51">
Carnarvon&s;hire. In the narrowe&s;t part, it is about the &s;ame breadth as the Thames at We&s;tmin&s;ter-bridge. The principal town in the i&s;land is Beaumaris, it received this name in the time of Edward I. who built the ca&s;tle, and is derived from the French Beau-marais<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beau-marais, &s;ignifies in French a fine mar&s;h, the &s;ituation of this town exactly corre&s;ponds with this de|rivation. Part of Paris, which is &s;ituated very low, is called Du-marais, i. e. of the mar&s;h.</NOTE>, which language was then prevalent, and is de&s;criptive of its &s;ituation. A fine green lawn before the town, from whence we have a charming pro&s;pect of the Carnarvon&s;hire mountains, with a haven of the &s;ea, renders this place delightful. The town is in a declining condition. Before Liverpool be|came &s;o great a mart, this place carried on a con&s;iderable trade, which it has now en|tirely lo&s;t. It con&s;i&s;ts of two or three good &s;treets, better built than the greate&s;t number of Wel&s;h towns. The ca&s;tle is not to be compared to tho&s;e of Carnarvon and Conway
<PB N="41" REF="52">
for beauty, though perhaps nor inferior in point of &s;trength.</P>
<P>Baron-hill, the &s;eat of lord Bulkeley, is &s;ituated upon an eminence, about half a mile di&s;tant from the town. It commands an ex|ten&s;ive and very beautiful pro&s;pect. The hou&s;e is not to be admired, but I prefer the &s;ituation to any that I have &s;een in Wales.</P>
<P>From Beaumaris we travelled through the whole extent of the county, till we came to Holy-head; which &s;tands on a promontory, in the remote&s;t corner of the i&s;land. This little town is a &s;ea-port, where the Dublin packets are &s;tationed. It is a place of con|&s;iderable re&s;ort, populous, and in a flouri&s;h|ing &s;tate.</P>
<P>We had a very unplea&s;ing journey from Beaumaris, to this place. The roads were exceeding deep; our hor&s;es &s;unk into the clay, &s;o that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty we travelled. But the turnpike roads in this county, are not inferior to any in the king|dom. During our whole day's journey, we &s;carce &s;aw a tree, or a gentleman's &s;eat.
<PB N="42" REF="53">
The face of the county affords a di&s;agreeable and melancholy pro&s;pect, though the land is &s;aid to be rich and fertile.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity induced me to view the &s;eat of the ancient Briti&s;h princes, Aberfraw: but how much were my expectations di&s;appointed! It is a little country village, without any re|mains of grandeur, or monuments of anti|quity, that I could di&s;cern.</P>
<P>I was told that part of the wall of the king's palace, was converted into a barn. It is a&s;toni&s;hing how the princes of North-Wales, could have cho&s;en &s;uch a &s;ituation for their re&s;idence; eligible for no rea&s;on that can now be conceived.</P>
<P>From Aberfraw we cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ands, and came to a corporation town, called New|borough. This place had a right of return|ing a member to &s;erve in parliament, which they have lo&s;t for &s;ome years. It appeared to me, to be an exceeding poor place; but I was told that the inhabitants were all &s;o in|du&s;trious, that there was not a beggar in the whole place; and indeed we did not find
<PB N="43" REF="54">
that any one a&s;ked alms of us; a circum&s;tance not very common in little country towns.</P>
<P>The la&s;t place we vi&s;ited in the i&s;land of Angle&s;ea, was the &s;eat of Sir Nicholas Bayly. It is built in the gothic &s;tile, with great ele|gance and &s;tate. Its &s;ituation on the banks of the Menai, with a pro&s;pect of the moun|tains at a di&s;tance, renders it the admiration of all who &s;ee it. After our tedious journey through the i&s;land, we were agreeably enter|tained with the vici&s;&s;itudes we here experi|enced, imagination cannot form a &s;cene more adapted for &s;olemn meditation. The &s;acred monuments of druidical antiquity, &s;urround|ed with the thick imbowering &s;hades of vene|rable oaks, render this place the &s;eat of con|templation; and put me in mind of tho&s;e beautiful lines in Mr. Warton's Plea&s;ures of Melancholy:
<Q><L>Hail, queen divine! whom as tradition tells,</L>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is much to be regretted, that a full account of the antiquities of Wales has never been publi&s;hed. There are ample ma|terials, to employ the pen of an antiquary. Mr. Edward Llwyd of the Mu&s;aeum at Ox|ford, made many valuable and curious col|lections for &s;uch a work, and likewi&s;e for a compleat natural hi&s;tory of the country. He lived not to fini&s;h &s;o great an undertaking; and the public are to lament, that no one has been found, who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of know|ledge and a&s;&s;iduity, to fini&s;h his de&s;ign. The materials that he left behind him are &s;till
<PB N="46" REF="57">
extant, and I am informed, may be procured without much difficulty, by any one who will execute his plan.</P>
<P>There were, before the reformation, large e&s;tates in Wales, dedicated to religious u&s;es. In every county are &s;till to be &s;een the vene|rable remains of many religious hou&s;es, mo|na&s;teries, and friaries. The people of this country, were formerly proverbially remark|ed for their &s;uper&s;tition; which makes it the le&s;s to be admired, that holy church had &s;o many domains in Wales.</P>
<P>During the few months I have re&s;ided in this country, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that I could minutely inve&s;tigate into the hi&s;tory of all the religious hou&s;es. And were I thoroughly acquainted with every particu|lar relating to &s;uch a &s;ubject, it would great|ly exceed the bounds of an epi&s;tolary corre&s;|pondence, to enter into a minute de&s;cription of them.</P>
<P>During our literary intercour&s;e, I &s;hall en|deavor to furni&s;h you with an account of all the principal ca&s;tles and fortifications that
<PB N="47" REF="58">
are now &s;tanding. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable, are &s;uch as were built by the Engli&s;h and Normans. I do not find that the Britons built their fortifications in the manner of the Engli&s;h. The Briti&s;h fortre&s;&s;es were of a circular form, the ramparts con&s;i&s;ted of mounds of earth, thrown up with three cir|cumvallations and fo&s;&s;es, of a &s;imilar con|&s;truction with Old Sarum. A variety of the&s;e fortifications and encampments are to be &s;een, on almo&s;t every hill through the country. On the &s;ea &s;hore, in every place where the enemy could with &s;afety land, the remains are &s;till to be di&s;cerned.</P>
<P>The great mu&s;aeum of druidical, as well as other antiquities, is the i&s;land of Angle&s;ea. Some account has been publi&s;hed by Mr. Rowland's, in his Mona Antiqua. An au|thor of no &s;mall repute among&s;t antiquarians, and highly venerated in that country. He was doubtle&s;s a man of great application and &s;ome learning. His Mona Antiqua con&s;i&s;ts rather of an account of the antiqui|ties of his own pari&s;h and neighbourhood,
<PB N="48" REF="59">
than of the whole i&s;land of Angle&s;ea. We find in it &s;ome ingenious ob&s;ervations, and accurate remarks. But replete with ill-founded conjectures, and &s;trained etymolo|gies, the mo&s;t ridiculous exertion of &s;cience. He derives the Wel&s;h or Briti&s;h language from the Hebrew, without any other foun|dation, than the congruity of &s;ound of a few words, with which it has manife&s;tly no more affinity, than it has with the Chine&s;e. Prai&s;e is however due to his labors, and I mean not to detract from his merit.</P>
<P>The remains of druidical antiquities, are very frequent over the whole i&s;land of An|gle&s;ea; near Plas-Newydd, the &s;eat of Sir Nicholas Bayly, which I de&s;cribed in a for|mer letter, there is a druidical altar &s;till re|maining entire. In various places are to be &s;een the CARNS, or more properly CARNEDDE. The&s;e are generally &s;ituated on an eminence, and con&s;i&s;t of a large tumulus of &s;tones. The vulgar attribute them to the work of giants. The truth &s;eems to be, that they are the &s;e|pulchres of per&s;ons of renown. When the
<PB N="49" REF="60">
general of an army died, or was killed in battle, it was u&s;ual for all who lamented him, to throw a &s;tone upon his grave. The greater the tumulus, the more honorable was his interment. Though this practice has been probably difu&s;ed for ages, yet it is a common expre&s;&s;ion in the country to this day, to &s;ay of a man that died unlamented, Ni rhof i mor carreg ar iw fedd, i. e. I will not throw a &s;tone upon his grave. Mr. Mac|pher&s;on, in a book he has lately publi&s;hed, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"That in the highlands of Scotland there are many of the&s;e tumuli, which they call Carns, and that he cau&s;ed many of them to be thrown down, and always found under the heap, &s;ome &s;tones placed in the form of a coffin, and often the bones remaining."</Q> I wanted not inclination to have the experi|ment tried here, but had neither time nor opportunity to make &s;uch a trial; and I much que&s;tion, whether the people of the country are not &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, as to prevent any &s;uch attempts.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="61">Be&s;ides the CARNEDDE ju&s;t de&s;cribed, there are many ORSEDDE, or ORSEDD-FAINCIA, and CROMLECHE. I conjecture the cromleche to have been &s;tones, where the druids &s;acrificed to their deities. We have le&s;s doubt con|cerning the or&s;edde, or or&s;edd-faincia. For it is not que&s;tioned from the import of the word, as well as their appearance, but that they were druidical judgment &s;eats. In tho&s;e times, the druids were prie&s;ts, law-givers and judges. The veneration paid to their &s;acred characters, gave weight and au|thority to their deci&s;ions. In this the Britains re&s;embled the accounts given of the Germans, and Gauls by Tacitus and Cae&s;ar. I &s;hall forbear &s;aying any thing farther at pre&s;ent upon this point, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention it in a future letter, when I come to &s;peak of the laws of the ancient Britons.</P>
<P>It does not appear that the Wel&s;h, or Briti&s;h princes, ever coined any money. They paid their mulcts, like the Germans, in cattle, Luitur certo armentorum aut pecorum nu|mero. I allow that in particular ca&s;es, a fine
<PB N="51" REF="62">
was to be paid in gold or &s;ilver, for offences committed again&s;t the per&s;on of the king or queen. For defiling the prince's bed, the offender was to pay a rod of pure &s;olid gold, of the thickne&s;s of a plowman's finger, that had ploughed nine years, in length from the ground to the prince's mouth when &s;itting. In what part of Wales &s;uch a quantity of gold was then to be found, is a my&s;tery that I will not undertake to unfold.</P>
<P>I am afraid I weary your patience on this &s;ubject, and mu&s;t conclude, by a&s;&s;uring you that I am</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE not, my dear friend, in any former letter de&s;cribed to you the place of my re&s;idence in this country, the &s;cene from whence the&s;e letters have been written.</P>
<P>After I had fini&s;hed my tour of North Wales, I determined to fix upon the mo&s;t romantic and unfrequented &s;ituation, for the &s;cene of a few month's retirement. A place where I could not be interrupted with the impertinent intru&s;ion of affected gentility, or di&s;gu&s;ted with the ridiculous ceremonies of fal&s;e politene&s;s. I did not long he&s;itate in my choice. The &s;ituation of this place, and the great abundance of game, the country af|forded,
<PB N="53" REF="64">
confirmed my determination. I board with the curate of the pari&s;h, who is the only per&s;on in the neighbourhood capable of con|ver&s;ing with me. The curate is a venerable clergyman, on the eve of three&s;core. He wears his own natural grey locks, and &s;till retains a ruddy bloom in his countenance, acquired by health and exerci&s;e. He has lived among the&s;e mountains for near forty years, upon a curacy and a little paternal e&s;tate, which he cultivates with his own hands. His whole revenue amounts not to forty pounds per annum, and yet that ex|ceeds his expences,
<Q><L>Who&s;e little &s;tore, his well taught mind does plea&s;e,</L>
<L>Not pinched with want, nor cloy'd with wanton ea&s;e;</L>
<L>Who free from &s;torms, which on the great ones fall,</L>
<L>Makes but few wi&s;hes, and enjoys them all.</L>
<BIBL>ROSCOMMON.</BIBL></Q>
<PB N="54" REF="65">
This place is a &s;mall village among the Car|narvon&s;hire hills, &s;ituated in a valley, &s;ur|rounded on every &s;ide by rocks and moun|tains, through which a river a winds its irri|guous cour&s;e. We are never at a lo&s;s for rural diver&s;ions. Earth, air and water vie with each other in furni&s;hing us entertain|ment. Our table is &s;pread by our indu&s;try. The &s;ame exerci&s;e contributes to our health and our amu&s;ement; and at the &s;ame time that our exerci&s;e gives us an appetite, it pro|cures us al&s;o the means of &s;atisfying it. Our craft and &s;ubtlety is not employed (as it is among the greate&s;t part of mankind) again&s;t our own &s;pecies; we carry on an innocent war again&s;t tho&s;e animals, over which the bountiful Creator gave us a &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>Various were the conjectures of the country people concerning me, when fir&s;t I came to this place. What commenced in &s;u&s;picion, was likely to terminate in antipathy, but by the proper application of a few pieces of glittering ore, and the knowledge of a few Wel&s;h words, I &s;oon became highly re&s;pected.
<PB N="55" REF="66">
And they all obey my commands, as readily as any monarch is obeyed by his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>I had long a de&s;ire of vi&s;iting the Wel&s;h Alps, the &s;ummit of Snowdon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Snowdon, comprehended formerly the counties of Merionydd and Carnarvon, and the mountainous part of Denbigh&s;hire; it is now confined to a mountain of that name.</NOTE>. The curate was &s;o much devoted to me, that I did not employ my rhetoric long, before I prevailed upon him to accompany me in the expedi|tion. We &s;et out from our hermitage, in the month of July; we arrived in the evening at a &s;mall thatched hut, at the foot of the mountain, near a lake which they call Llyn Cychwhechlyn, which I leave you to pronounce as well as you are able. At this hut we found a poor labouring man, with five or &s;ix children, the pictures of health and innocence. We had brought provi&s;ions with us for our journey, and we regaled our&s;elves in this &s;ituation, the family parta|king of our fea&s;t, with more &s;atisfaction and
<PB N="56" REF="67">
glee, than I have ever found at a nobleman's &s;umptuous entertainment.</P>
<P>We were determined to amu&s;e our&s;elves, as well as we could in this dreary &s;ituation. For this purpo&s;e we &s;ent for a poor blind harper, and procured a number of blooming country girls to divert us with their mu&s;ic and dancing. There is &s;omething very plain|tive and affecting in the Wel&s;h mu&s;ic, and the manner of their &s;inging &s;ymphonious and re&s;pon&s;ive to the notes of the harp, renders it exceeding melodious. It gave me infi|nitely more plea&s;ure to hear this ru&s;tic con|cert, than the fine&s;t airs of an Italian opera; and to &s;ee the&s;e ro&s;y rural nymphs direct their mazy &s;teps, without the needle&s;s &s;ump|tuous apparel of luxury and pride, than all the ladies at St. James's, in their artificial beauty and attire.</P>
<P>At the dawn of day, we began our jour|ney up the mountain, which &s;eemed to &s;cale the heavens. I cannot give you a better de&s;cription of it, than is contained in the following lines of Mr. Pope:
<Q><PB N="57" REF="68">
<L>So plea&s;ed at fir&s;t the tow'ring Alps we try,</L>
<L>Mount o'er the vales and &s;eem to tread the &s;ky;</L>
<L>Th' eternal &s;nows appear already pa&s;t,</L>
<L>And the fir&s;t clouds and mountains &s;eem the la&s;t.</L>
<L>But tho&s;e attained, we trembled to &s;urvey,</L>
<L>The growing labors of the lengthened way;</L>
<L>The increa&s;ing pro&s;pect tires our wandring eyes,</L>
<L>Hills peep o'er hills and alps o'er alps ari&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>We found a great change in the tempe|rature of the atmo&s;phere, as we a&s;cended the mountain. When we had gone half way up, we found the wind rather high, attended with &s;cudding clouds. But when we arrived at the &s;ummit, the air was calm and &s;erene, and &s;eemed much more &s;ubtle and rarified, le&s;s impregnated with vapors, and more agreeable for re&s;piration.</P>
<Q><L>Hid above the clouds,</L>
<L>Tho' winds and tempe&s;ts beat their aged feet;</L>
<L><PB N="58" REF="69">Their peaceful heads, nor &s;torms, nor tem|pe&s;ts know,</L>
<L>But &s;corn the threatning rack that rolls below.</L>
<BIBL>DRYDEN.</BIBL></Q>
<P>How &s;hall I de&s;cribe to you the infinitely exten&s;ive and variegated pro&s;pects we enjoyed from the &s;ummit? lakes, mountains, &s;eas, rivers, plains, woods and i&s;lands lay before us, in the greate&s;t diver&s;ity. We &s;aw di&s;tinctly the north of England, the greate&s;t part of Wales, Che&s;hire, Shrop&s;hire, Ireland, the i&s;le of Man and Scotland. I doubt whether &s;o exten&s;ive a circular pro&s;pect is to be &s;een in any part of the terraqueous globe.</P>
<P>As our &s;ituation was exalted above the globe, &s;o were our ideas. And the nearer we were to the etherial regions, the more our &s;ouls &s;eemed to partake of their purity. Our minds like the &s;erene face of the &s;ky, undi&s;|turbed with the &s;torms of the pa&s;&s;ions became equal and compo&s;ed. We were in&s;pired with &s;entiments of commi&s;eration and contempt,
<PB N="59" REF="70">
in contemplating the vain magnificence of human grandeur; and the pur&s;uits of the world, for a few pieces of ore, which nature prudently concealed in the bowels of the&s;e mountains.</P>
<P>O my friend, why &s;hould we return to the bu&s;y haunt of men? why were we doomed to drag an exi&s;tence in populous cities and the crouded forum! O that it had been our lot to live among the&s;e mountains, unenvied and unknown!</P>
<P>Excu&s;e, my friend, the&s;e reveries. I &s;hall endeavor to atone for them, by ha&s;tening to a conclu&s;ion. The &s;un had now gained its meridian height, and &s;hot forth its noontide rays with unu&s;ual fervor. When we began to de&s;cend the hill, we perceived a &s;mall murky cloud ri&s;e out of the &s;ea. The cloud conden&s;ed and increa&s;ed, until the whole at|mo&s;phere became inveloped in darkne&s;s, and night &s;eemed to have regained her ebon throne. Neither hou&s;e nor tree was near to afford us protection, but all was one va&s;t continued wa&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="71">In this &s;ituation we could only have re|cour&s;e to the ho&s;pitable &s;helter of the next impending rock. Here we awaited with fear and impatience, till the &s;torm was &s;pent.
<Q><L>Either tropic now,</L>

<L>From many a horrid rift abortive pour'd</L>
<L>Fierce rain with lightning mix'd, water with fire,</L>
<L>In ruin reconcil'd. Dreadful was the rack,</L>
<L>As earth and &s;ky would mingle.</L>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q>
The thunder reverberated from rock to rock, and the whole artillery of heaven &s;eemed to be at once di&s;charged.
<Q><L>Amid Carnarvon's mountains rages loud</L>
<L>The repercu&s;&s;ive roar. With mighty cru&s;h</L>

When the &s;torm was appea&s;ed, and the face of heaven had rea&s;&s;umed its wonted &s;erenity, we continued our journey. Plea&s;ed, though fatigued, with our excursion, we regained our homely dwelling, from whence I have now the happine&s;s of writing to you, and a&s;&s;uring you that I am,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN ob&s;erving the manners and cu&s;toms of this people, &s;ome idea may be formed of their ance&s;tors, the ancient Britons. They have pre&s;erved them&s;elves almo&s;t intirely di&s;tinct from all other nations. They po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed nothing that could tempt the ambi|tion of foreigners. Having no allurement from a pro&s;pect of commercial advantage, or the charms of opulence and fertility; they remained &s;trangers to a country which afford|ed no incitement to avarice or ambition. Thus, I will not &s;ay unhappily, excluded from the conflux of &s;trangers, the pure Briti&s;h
<PB N="63" REF="74">
blood flows unadulterated in their veins. Their cu&s;toms, manners, virtues, and even vices, are pre&s;erved as a &s;acred depo&s;itum, inherited from their ance&s;tors, and ob&s;erved with religious veneration.</P>
<P>My friend, the curate, of whom I gave &s;ome account in my la&s;t letter, &s;upplies me with every nece&s;&s;ary information, re&s;pecting the language, manners, and cu&s;toms of this people, who&s;e veracity cannot be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>I have already de&s;cribed to you the dif|ferent ceremonies, attending the marriages of this people, they are no le&s;s &s;ingular in their funerals.</P>
<P>The evening preceding the burial, they have what they call WYL-NOS, i. e. the night of lamentation. All the neighbors attend at the hou&s;e of the decea&s;ed, the mini&s;ter, or in his ab&s;ence the clerk of the pari&s;h, comes and prays over the dead, and p&s;alms are &s;ung agreeable to the mournful occa&s;ion. This it may not unrea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, is the remains of the Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition of re|quiems for the &s;ouls of the decea&s;ed. How|ever
<PB N="64" REF="75">
there is nothing improper in the cu&s;tom if conducted with decorum and devotion, which is not always the ca&s;e. At the fune|ral, the relations and friends of the decea&s;ed make pre&s;ents, to the officiating clergyman, and the clerk of the pari&s;h. The&s;e offerings are altogether voluntary, generally propor|tionable to their circum&s;tances, and the re&s;|pect they bear to the memory of their de|parted friend. In &s;ome populous pari&s;hes, the offerings are very con&s;iderable, and con|&s;titute a great part of the profits of a living. There is no doubt but that this is likewi&s;e a relict of the Popi&s;h cu&s;tom, of giving money to their prie&s;ts, for praying that the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed may be relieved from purgatory.</P>
<P>It is a cu&s;tom likewi&s;e invariably ob&s;erved to make a bonfire near every hou&s;e on All-&s;aints eve. Whether this was originally ow|ing to public rejoicing, or to &s;ome &s;uper&s;ti|tious ceremony, I could never be informed.</P>
<P>Among the amu&s;ements of the country, the principal are the &s;tage plays. You will &s;mile, when I tell you that we have comedies
<PB N="65" REF="76">
and tragedies. King David and Solomon are often brought upon the &s;tage, and are taught to &s;peak pure Wel&s;h. The&s;e enter|tainments are called ANTERLUTES, which &s;eems to be no more than a corruption of the Engli&s;h word interlude.</P>
<P>My curio&s;ity prevailed upon me to go and &s;ee one of the&s;e plays acted, the &s;tage con|&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome boards fixed at the end of a barn; beneath it was the green room; for it was a &s;mall inclo&s;ure made up of furze. The play that was acted, was king Lear; but &s;o mutilated and murdered, that I was told it had &s;carce any other re&s;emblance to the play written by Shake&s;peare, than the name. It was not unentertaining to &s;ee the&s;e brawny ploughmen, act in the characters of Lear's daughters.</P>
<P>The two principal characters which they never fail to introduce into every play, are tho&s;e of the fool and mi&s;er. The former u&s;es all kind of indecent ribaldry, ob&s;cene ge&s;tures, and expre&s;&s;ions, which generally prove highly entertaining to the audience.
<PB N="66" REF="77">
This repre&s;entation put me in mind of the de&s;cription, given by Horace, of the fir&s;t comic actors.<Q>Dicitur et pla&s;tris vexa&s;&s;e poemata The&s;pis.</Q></P>
<P>The people of this country are not infe|rior in &s;uper&s;tition to the Laplanders. The mo&s;t improbable and ab&s;urd tales of haun|ted hou&s;es, demons, and apparitions, are re|lated and believed. Nor can many be found &s;o hardy, as to doubt the exi&s;tence of witches, fairies, elves, and all the bugbears of a winter's eve.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE heard it often a&s;&s;erted that mankind are the &s;ame in all countries. This, if true, will de&s;troy the very idea of national characters. And yet experience will ju&s;tify the ob&s;ervation, that there is a very wide difference between the inhabitants of A&s;ia and Europe, between tho&s;e of Spain, France and England, and even between the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h. If no more is meant by &s;uch an ob&s;ervation, than that man in a &s;tate of nature, is the &s;ame in every country, I will admit it to be true. But man is no longer what nature formed him. Education
<PB N="68" REF="79">
has furni&s;hed him with vices, with prejudices, with a certain range of ideas, and mode of thinking, which &s;tamp his character. Hence the difference of fa&s;hion, conduct and cha|racter which we ob&s;erve in every country.</P>
<P>In a &s;tate of nature, the wants of man are merely phy&s;ical, confined to the &s;u&s;tenance of corporeal exi&s;tence. In a &s;tate of &s;ociety mo&s;t of his nece&s;&s;ities are acquired, at fir&s;t imaginary, and in proce&s;s of time become real. How few are the wants of the pea&s;ant, who dwells in a &s;traw-built but, on a barren mountain, which the avarice of man has not reduced to property, compared to tho&s;e of the lord nur&s;ed in the cradle of indolence and luxury!</P>
<P>It was in a &s;tate of &s;ociety, that Hobbes ought to have &s;ought for his &s;tate of war, and not in that of nature. It is in &s;ociety that the intere&s;ts of mankind perpetually cla&s;h with each other. Many pur&s;ue the &s;ame object; a&s;pire to the &s;ame po&s;t or em|ployment. We all pay our devoirs to the inchanting godde&s;s gold; the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;|pen&s;er
<PB N="69" REF="80">
of all &s;ublunary happine&s;s. The godde&s;s &s;miles on &s;ome of her votaries, frowns on others. Her di&s;carded devotees endeavor to &s;upplant &s;uch as &s;hare her favors. Every engine which imagination can invent, is u&s;ed to effectuate the purpo&s;e. This is the box of Pandora, from whence all the evils and calamities of life proceed. Hence deceit is become a nece&s;&s;ary art, taught in the &s;chool of the world, univer&s;ally &s;tudied and univer|&s;ally admired. It is the ladder of preferment, and the &s;tep of ambition. Its perfection is called politene&s;s, and its defect ru&s;ticity. In different degrees it is u&s;ed by all; from the courtier who pours the delicious poi&s;on of flattery into his prince's ears, to the ru&s;tic pea&s;ant who bows to the little tyrant of a country village.</P>
<P>An unpoli&s;hed people cannot have attained to the refinement of deceit, that we find among the more civilized nations. Hence the idea of in&s;incerity is always, not impro|perly, connected with the politene&s;s of a
<PB N="70" REF="81">
courtier, and French complai&s;ance and deceit are joined as in&s;eperable companions.</P>
<P>If we would view the heart of man with|out di&s;gui&s;e, it is among the rude and unci|vilized inhabitants of mountains. Too art|le&s;s to conceal the dictates of their hearts, the tongue reveals the &s;entiments of the mind. Hence tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which are con|cealed or di&s;gui&s;ed in more civilized countries, appear here in their native colors.</P>
<P>The nationality, if I may &s;o call it, of the Scotch, has been proverbial, and it is owing to that mutual &s;upport, that they have made &s;o con&s;picuous a figure. The natives of this country are in no degree remarked for this quality; to this it may be attributed, that they &s;carce ever ri&s;e to any con&s;iderable &s;tation or eminence in any profe&s;&s;ion or de|partment; unplaced and unpen&s;ioned, they are perhaps the only part of the king's &s;ub|jects, who have not had &s;ome &s;hare in the profits of government, and enjoyed &s;ome of the &s;poils of the public. Thus without the mutual friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance of each other, or
<PB N="71" REF="82">
the &s;un&s;hine of court favor, they &s;eldom emerge from their original ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>O pure and immaculate friend&s;hip; thou gem, who&s;e lu&s;tre remains unimpaired by the de&s;olating hand of time, and undimini&s;hed by the rough &s;torm of adver&s;e fortune, who receive&s;t additional &s;plendor from age, and &s;hine&s;t bright under the &s;evere&s;t trial! Art thou to be found among the&s;e de&s;art rocks, or in the fertile plains of cultivated nature.</P>
<P>Thou art not the partial inhabitant of country or clime.

That connection which the vulgar call friend&s;hip, which ari&s;es from the participation of the &s;ame brutal plea&s;ures, is as fleeting as tho&s;e plea&s;ures, which gave it birth. The intimacy accruing from the &s;ociety of an idle hour, which had better been blotted from the hoary calendar of time, or the &s;ame convi|vial

fe&s;tivity, as it has its exi&s;tence, &s;o it ends with the circulating gla&s;s.</P>
<P>O thou guilele&s;s and un&s;u&s;picious youth, who art now launching thy bark, and unfurl|ing thy &s;ails, to commence the difficult and dangerous voyage of life! Who fondly ex|pecte&s;t the &s;un&s;hine of fortune, and the gales of pro&s;perity, to &s;peed thy de&s;tined voyage.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND you are di&s;plea&s;ed with my phi|lo&s;ophical reveries. Be a&s;&s;ured, you &s;hall be troubled with no more of them. I am, however, determined that you &s;hall do pe|nance for your di&s;approbation, not by walk|ing bare-foot to the &s;hrine of St. Winifred, but by having the drudgery impo&s;ed on you of reading the following letter.</P>
<P>Our journey from Carnarvon to this town, has been through a country the mo&s;t rocky, and abounding with the mo&s;t romantic pro&s;|pects, that we have travelled &s;ince we came to Wales. We pa&s;&s;ed under Snowdon, thro'
<PB N="74" REF="85">
a village called Berthgelet. Two con&s;ider|able lakes are adjacent to the road, in which the fal&s;e pen of Giraldus &s;ays, there were floating i&s;lands, and which is now affirmed by &s;ome, who have as little regard to truth as Giraldus. This &s;ide the village of Berthgelet, is the famous Pont-Aber-gla&s;slyn. This is a bridge thrown over a con&s;iderable water-fall, from one mountain to another. Contiguous to it is a &s;almon leap, where the fi&s;h continu|ally make efforts to leap up a rock, about &s;ix yards high, to lay their &s;pawn; a net is placed under the rock, in order to catch them as they fall. So &s;tupendous is the &s;tructure of this bridge, in the eyes of the ignorant coun|try people, that they do not he&s;itate to pro|nounce it to be the work of &s;upernatural agency. It may be curious to know upon what condition his &s;atanic maje&s;ty would turn ma&s;ter builder. The agreement was drawn up by one of his agents, who a&s;&s;umed the not unu&s;ual form a lawyer, and thereby it was covenanted, &s;tipulated, ratified, agreed, and a thou&s;and more &s;uch redundant words,
<PB N="75" REF="86">
and the condition of the obligation was &s;uch, that his infernal highne&s;s was to have the fir&s;t that went over the bridge for his trouble and expence. But a method was contrived to defraud him, by driving a dog over, which was all the pay he had for building the famous bridge of Aber-gla&s;slyn. Why &s;hould this ac|count be thought more extraordinary, than the de&s;cription we have in Milton of Sin and Death building a bridge over chaos to this world.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Aber-gla&s;slyn is exceeding romantic, the rocks impend over you, &s;o that you may with truth &s;ay,
<Q><L>Tres pateat caeli &s;patium non amplias ulnas.</L>

<BIBL>DRYDEN'S VIRGIL.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>From hence we cro&s;&s;ed a dangerous &s;and, called Traeth-maur, and came to Harlech ca&s;tle. This is a very magnificent &s;tructure
<PB N="76" REF="87">
&s;ituated on an eminence. Beneath it there is a fine mar&s;h of &s;ome miles extent, upon which the &s;ea adjoins. It does not clearly appear by whom this ca&s;tle was built; though we may conjecture that it is the work of &s;ome of the fir&s;t kings of the Norman line.</P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of Avionydd, we &s;ee the ca&s;tle of Crycaith. This is &s;ituated on a &s;mall hill, wa&s;hed on one &s;ide by the &s;ea. The a&s;cent to it is very &s;teep quaquaver&s;ally. The ca&s;tle is but very &s;mall, in compari&s;on to tho&s;e I have already de&s;cribed. It is not improbable but that this ca&s;tle was built by &s;ome of the Wel&s;h or Briti&s;h princes. Tra|dition informs us that all that part, now co|vered with the &s;ea, between Crycaith and Harlech, was formerly a fine level country, called Cantref-Gwaelod, i. e. the plain of a hundred town&s;hips. Some manu&s;cripts in Wel&s;h, I am informed, give an account of the &s;ea over-flowing this plain, but at what time this happened does not appear, or whether ever it was different from what it is at pre&s;ent, I am greatly inclined to doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="88">From Harlech we pur&s;ued our journey to Tan-y-bwlch, in the vale of Fe&s;tiniog. Here we re&s;ted a night, at a &s;mall inn, where we met with very good accommodations. The vale of Fe&s;tiniog has been much admired by travellers. The meanders of a winding &s;tream, the wood-capt hills, with which it is environed, form, I own, a beautiful pro&s;|pect. But, perhaps, the &s;triking contra&s;t, between this little vale and the horrid country round it, contributes mo&s;t to plea&s;e the eye of the wearied traveller.</P>
<P>About fifteen miles from Tan-y-bwlch is the town of Bala. Its name is de&s;criptive of its &s;ituation, being upon the banks of a fine lake, three miles long and one broad. It is famous for a peculiar &s;pecies of whiting, called GWINNIAD. This lake in Wel&s;h is called, LLYN-TEGID, i. e. the fine pool; Teg, &s;ignifying fair or fine in that lan|guage. In Engli&s;h it is called, Pimblemere. Giraldus Cambren&s;is, in his Itinerary, &s;ays, that the wind is always very high, and that it never runs on this lake. Credat qui vult.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="89">About fifteen miles di&s;tant from Bala is the town of Dolgelle, the metropolis of this rugged county. It is a very irregular, and badly-built town, at the foot of a very high mountain, called Cader-ydris<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cader-ydris, &s;ignifies the chair or &s;eat of Ydris.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inhabitants of this county are more purely Briti&s;h, than tho&s;e of any other part of Wales. Like the clans of Scotland, or Hebrew tribes, they &s;carce ever intermarry, except with tho&s;e of their own lineage. Through the whole county, they are all cou&s;ins, all of the &s;ame Wel&s;h plood, and mo&s;t of them of the &s;ame names.</P>
<P>If you would a&s;k them, how they &s;pend their lives in this part of the world; they have it in their power to an&s;wer you in a few words; We drink, dance, and are merry. Indeed, I do not know a people &s;o much
<PB N="80" REF="91">
addicted to mirth. The complexion of their country, one would imagine, could not in|&s;pire &s;uch &s;entiments of fe&s;tivity and joy. They &s;ing, dance, and drink, not by hours, but by days and weeks; and mea&s;ure time only by the continuance of their mirth and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The men e&s;timate their &s;trength not by feats of activity, as in other places, but by the quantities of ale they can drink; and, I am told, it is no uncommon thing for a lover to boa&s;t to his mi&s;tre&s;s, what feats he has performed in this way. Such is the mark of prowe&s;s, by which the women judge of their paramour's vigor and &s;trength of con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>From hence we may conclude that Bacchus does more execution in this country, than Mars does in Germany. Such, who&s;e happy poverty preclude them from procuring tho&s;e liquors, which are the de&s;truction of the more opulent, live to an advanced age. Whil&s;t mo&s;t of the gentry and &s;quires, are carried off in their youth; thus the heir does not
<PB N="81" REF="92">
long wait for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate, nor does he long enjoy it. This vice is heredi|tary in families, and de&s;cends from father to &s;on.</P>
<Q><L>Uno avul&s;o non deficit alter</L>
<L>&mdash; et &s;imili fronde&s;cit virga metallo.</L></Q>
<P>The fe&s;cennine licence, is here enjoyed in its mo&s;t unbounded extent. In conver&s;ation they take the utmo&s;t freedom and liberty with each other, which is generally borne in good part. They are always endeavoring to frame ru&s;tic jokes, not always the mo&s;t deli|cate. Happy does he e&s;teem him&s;elf, who comes off conqueror in this certamen of ru&s;|tic wit.</P>
<P>Unembarra&s;&s;ed with the pedantry of learn|ing, and the di&s;gu&s;ting forms of politene&s;s, the good people of Merionydd are free, ho&s;|pitable, and chearful. Let them enjoy their mirth unrivalled, undi&s;turbed by foreigners, in &s;ecurity and ea&s;e. They always will re|main unenvied in the participation of that
<PB N="82" REF="93">
happine&s;s, which none but a native of that country can feel.</P>
<P>The Wel&s;h language is here &s;poken with the greate&s;t cla&s;&s;ical purity. Here they boa&s;t of their Wel&s;h bards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Wel&s;h word is Bardd.</NOTE>, who are poets by nature. The&s;e bards are idle fellows, who &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the bounty of the Wel&s;h gentry. They, and their allie&s;men the harpers, who form a very numerous corps, are generally invited to entertain the company at their fea&s;ts, which is done by buffoonery and illi|beral abu&s;ive extempore rhyme. Sometimes a bard comes to the door, and demands ad|mittance in rhyme; he is an&s;wered by the bard within, in rhyme likewi&s;e; if the &s;tranger, in the opinion of the company, gains the vic|tory in this poetical conte&s;t; he is admitted to partake of the fea&s;t, while the vanqui&s;hed bard is turned out to the former's uncom|fortable &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Somewhat &s;imilar to this was the great fea&s;t which was made in South-Wales, where
<PB N="83" REF="94">
bards from various parts were invited to a poetical combat, and where it is &s;aid the North-Wales poets gained the victory.</P>
<P>This vagabond poetical tribe, were for|merly a great nui&s;ance in this country, and we find divers acts of parliament and regu|lations made to &s;uppre&s;s them. It is &s;aid that Edward I. cruelly de&s;troyed them, it may be doubted whether it was not the greate&s;t benefit he could do to the country. In Henry IVths time it was enacted, that, <Q REND="inline">"No we&s;tours, ry|mours, min&s;trels, or other vagabonds, &s;hould go about pur faire Kymortha ou coilage."</Q> The learned author of the ob&s;ervations on the ancient &s;tatutes, has mi&s;taken the mean|ing of the word Kymortha, or rather Cymor|tha (the C in Wel&s;h having the &s;ound of the Engli&s;h K) it &s;ignifying a charitable aid or &s;upport. This is the &s;ignification it has in the act of 26 Henry VIII. where it is enacted, that, <Q REND="inline">"No one without licence of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners, &s;hall Kymortha under color of marrying, &s;inging fir&s;t ma&s;&s;es, &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="95">Cymortha, is a word frequently u&s;ed in Wales at this time. A poor new-married couple often go about the country to get &s;omething to begin the world, as they call it.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN proportion as a people increa&s;e in trade, in luxury, in all the arts of &s;ocial and commercial life, their language becomes more copious and refined. The wants of mankind in an infant &s;tate of &s;ociety are few, their ideas are few, and con&s;equently the &s;ounds expre&s;&s;ive of &s;uch ideas. At fir&s;t capable only of &s;imple apprehen&s;ion, we by degrees form complex and ab&s;tract ideas. The lan|guage of &s;ocieties is not formed in a day. It is the work of ages; words are daily borrow|ed, transformed, according to the pre&s;ent exigency; and coined, when nece&s;&s;ity requires,
<PB N="86" REF="97">
which the common con&s;ent of mankind alone can render current.</P>
<P>As this people have made no very con&s;i|derable progre&s;s in a &s;tate of civilization, we might naturally be induced to think that their language is barbarous and uncultivated; but the contrary is true. It is not clogged with tho&s;e many inharmonious mono&s;yllables, the &s;igns of moods, ten&s;es, and ca&s;es, as the Engli&s;h language. It is much more harmo|nious and expre&s;&s;ive in its numbers and for|mation; one word in Wel&s;h frequently ex|pre&s;&s;ing as much as a &s;entence in the Engli&s;h; of which a late ingenious writer has given abundant &s;pecimens.</P>
<P>Though this is the language of a people, who inhabit a &s;mall barren &s;pot of earth, &s;carce known in the world; unimproved in the arts of life, entirely neglected and un|cultivated; and not &s;poken, except by &s;uch who willingly forfeit every claim to polite|ne&s;s; yet its variety, copiou&s;ne&s;s, and even harmony, is to be equalled by few, perhaps excelled by none.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="98">But our wonder cea&s;es, when we con&s;ider that it is not &s;olely the language of a people confined in a little corner of this i&s;land. It is the language of populous and even civi|lized nations, the antient Celts. Hence its variety and its harmony. It is the language of a brave people. Hence tho&s;e &s;ounds that rou&s;ed the &s;oul to action. Animated by the&s;e, they de&s;pi&s;ed danger and death for their country.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ome account for the policy of Edward I. who in order to en&s;lave the people, thought it a nece&s;&s;ary previous &s;tep to de&s;troy the bards, who cultivated their language and poetry.</P>
<P>This language &s;eems to be more particu|larly adapted for poetry; which, however extraordinary it may &s;eem to &s;ome, on account of the multiplicity of gutturals and con&s;o|nants with which it abounds, has the &s;oftne&s;s and harmony of the Italian, with the ma|je&s;ty and expre&s;&s;ion of the Greek. In the formation of its poetical numbers, it differs from all modern languages. Every line con|&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="88" REF="99">
of a certain regular number of feet, like other languages; but herein it differs, that it has a certain kind of rhyme<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Giraldus Cambren&s;is, to &s;hew the nature of Wel&s;h poetry, quotes the following pentameter, <Q><L>Factus es O pulcher paene puella puer.</L></Q> The following latin hexameter of Cicero, with the tran&s;lation by Dryden, may with as much propriety be adduced to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, <Q><L>O fortunatam natam me con&s;ule Romam.</L></Q><Q><L>Fortune, fortuned the dying note of Rome,</L><L>'Till I her con&s;ul's &s;oul con&s;oled her doom.</L></Q></NOTE>, jingle, or al|literation, not that terminates the line, but runs through every part of it.</P>
<P>The poets, or &s;uch as pretend to be &s;uch, arrogate to them&s;elves a mo&s;t unwarrantable poetical licence of coining words, for the &s;ake of &s;ound; and this they will &s;eldom &s;cruple to do, whenever they want a word for rhyme. Hence the greate&s;t part of their poetry, is nothing more than melodious non|&s;en&s;e,
<PB N="89" REF="100">
a perfect jargon of harmonious &s;ounds. And when tran&s;lated, &s;carce reducible to common &s;en&s;e. This unbounded poetical licence, though generally, yet, is not univer|&s;ally adopted. For there are not wanting many poets, who &s;eldom claim this unwar|rantable prerogative of coining words ad libitum.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations, that I have made on the Wel&s;h language, are the re&s;ult of a con|ver&s;ation I have had with &s;uch as are well acquainted with the &s;ubject.

<P>THE internal &s;trength, riches, and po|pulou&s;ne&s;s of a country, depend in a great degree, upon the cultivation of the land. The adventitious wealth and power, acquired by commerce, may flow in another channel, and revolt from one nation to ano|ther. Carthage and Tyre, have in ancient times, and Venice in more modern, been the emporiums of commerce. The&s;e &s;he has de&s;erted, and has taken her &s;eat in more nor|thern climes, where her abode is precarious, as in her former dominions. But the advan|tages re&s;ulting from agriculture are perma|nent;
<PB N="96" REF="107">
uncontroulable by fortuitous circum|&s;tances, they depend alone upon the indu&s;try of man. So kind and ju&s;t is nature, that &s;he rewards the hu&s;bandman, in proportion to his care and toil.</P>
<P>In the great empire of China, the riche&s;t and mo&s;t populous in the world, the land is cultivated to the very &s;ummit of the moun|tains. Earth is carried from the vallies to cover the barren rocks, which are converted to fruitful gardens. Were China not thus improved, could it maintain tho&s;e millions of inhabitants, who are employed in procur|ing &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for them&s;elves and others.</P>
<P>Agriculture has been ever e&s;teemed hon|orable among all great and wi&s;e nations. The Romans took their greate&s;t generals from the plough, to command their conquering armies. And the great emperor of China, who has perhaps more &s;ubjects, than there are inha|bitants in Europe, thinks it not unbecoming him to hold the plough, thereby &s;hewing an example worthy of his &s;ubjects imitation.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="108">Why &s;hould we &s;end colonies to cut down the va&s;t fore&s;ts of America, when we have &s;o much unimproved land in this kingdom? How many uncultivated heaths, parks, fo|re&s;ts, mar&s;hes, and commons are there, pro|fitable, neither to their proprietors, or the public? If our lands were properly cultivated the produce would be greatly increa&s;ed, and con&s;equently the &s;trength, riches, and popu|lation of the kingdom, would be proporti|onably augmented.</P>
<P>Several counties of Wales have made but a very &s;low progre&s;s in agriculture. In many places bordering upon England, they have in a great degree adopted the Engli&s;h man|ner of tillage. In &s;ome parts of the counties of Montgomery, Denbigh and Flint, the lands are well improved. I have made this ob&s;ervation, that the remoter they are from the Engli&s;h counties, the le&s;s is there of the &s;pirit of indu&s;try and improvment among the inhabitants.</P>
<P>In the county of Merionydd, they have very little good land, and they make &s;o bad
<PB N="98" REF="109">
an u&s;e of that, which nature has given them with &s;o &s;paring a hand, that &s;ome might be ready to conclude that they prefer their bar|ren rocks to the mo&s;t fertile &s;oil. In &s;ome places between the mountains, there are to be &s;een a few acres of good land, where the earth has been wa&s;hed away from the hills. The water generally &s;tagnates in the&s;e places, and they never take the trouble of draining them, but cut them in turbaries for fewel. Thus in a few years, they totally ruin their fine&s;t meadow land. The greate&s;t part of the country con&s;i&s;ts of barren mountains, in|capable of improvment. They &s;erve, how|ever, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t a great abundance of &s;heep. With the wool they make con&s;iderable quan|tities of flannel, which they export. This is the &s;taple manufacture and &s;upport of the county.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable part of Carnarvon&s;hire and the i&s;land of Angle&s;ea, is naturally a very good &s;oil, but very much unimproved. What they principally want, are good fences and &s;helter for their cattle. The only inclo&s;ures
<PB N="99" REF="110">
that they have, are &s;mall banks of earth or turf-mounds thrown up. The&s;e continue but a very little time, as the cattle de&s;troy them in the winter, and the farmer is at a con&s;iderable expence in repairing them every &s;pring. In &s;uch places as are expo&s;ed to the &s;ea winds, the trees will not grow to any height; and all kinds of quick&s;ets are long in their growth. So that the gentlemen and farmers &s;eldom judge it worth the trouble and expence to plant. But &s;atisfied I am that in a few years it would an&s;wer; and no|thing would contribute more to the improv|ment of the country, than if &s;uch a practice was generally adopted.</P>
<P>There are exten&s;ive fens undrained, and the greate&s;t part of the country con&s;i&s;ts of nothing but furze. The be&s;t land lets in general from three to five &s;hillings an acre; the price of labor about &s;ix-pence a day. There is great plenty of manure ea&s;ily to be had, and notwith&s;tanding the&s;e advantages, the country is unimproved. How &s;hall we ac|count for this? There is a certain &s;upinene&s;s
<PB N="100" REF="111">
in the greate&s;t part of country gentlemen, which renders them inattentive even to their own good. They live upon their e&s;tates, un&s;olicitous of what pa&s;&s;es in life, and pro|vided they enjoy the dull comforts of an animal exi&s;tence, they are &s;atisfied. Undi&s;|turbed with the &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e and am|bition, they follow the dull track of their ance&s;tors, without thought, and without re|flexion, and live and die unknown.</P>
<P>The farmers and laborers are mo&s;t of them mi&s;erably poor, they hold the lands generally from year to year at rack-rent. If one more indu&s;trious than the re&s;t, &s;hould make any improvment, the landlord advances his rent, or turns him out. Thus it is the intere&s;t of the farmer to let them lie wa&s;te, as he has no certainty of a return, when he is liable to be turned out at the landlord's plea&s;ure. Thus they only take care to get ju&s;t &s;uffi|cient by their indu&s;try to &s;upply pre&s;ent want, and let the morrow provide for it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Nothing would contribute more to the cultivation of the country, than the granting
<PB N="101" REF="112">
of lea&s;es for life to the farmers, even at ad|vanced rents. Then they would have a cer|tain pro&s;pect of profit for their labor and expence; which would ultimately turn out to the benefit of the landlord, the tenant, and the public.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM Merionyth&s;hire, the mo&s;t barren and de&s;olate part of Wales, we came to Montgomery&s;hire, which in many parts far exceeds any county of North-Wales, for fertility and richne&s;s of &s;oil. The Wel&s;h name is Tre-Faldwyn;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tre-Faldwyn, is probably a corruption of Tre-Baldwyn, i. e. Baldwyn's town; we are told by hi&s;to|rians that Montgomery was called, before it was taken by Sir Roger de Montgomery, the town and ca&s;tle of Bald|wyn. Who this Baldwyn was, I do not find recorded.</NOTE> the Engli&s;h Mont|gomery is derived from Sir Roger de Mont|gomery, a Norman baron, who had a grant of a great part of this country.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="114">Montgomery is but a very &s;mall town, thinly inhabited. There are to be &s;een the remains of a ca&s;tle, which was built in the time of William Rufus; in order mo&s;t pro|bably to &s;ecure the colony of Normans, who were &s;ent here to &s;ubdue the Wel&s;h, under the command of Sir Roger de Mont|gomery. The ca&s;tle is guarded by a craggy precipice on one &s;ide, and a deep fo&s;&s;e on the other.</P>
<P>The town of Wel&s;h-pool is the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable in the whole country. It is regular, well built, and &s;uperior to mo&s;t Wel&s;h towns. About a mile from Pool is Powis-ca&s;tle, the &s;eat of lord Powis, it is &s;ituated on a fine hill, which commands a pro&s;pect of an exten&s;ive, variegated, and fertile country. The vale of Montgomery, which we &s;ee from the ca&s;tle, is not equalled by any in point of fertility and beauty in Wales, nor perhaps in England. The Severn winds its &s;erpentine cour&s;e thro' this vale, and heightens the beauties of the pro&s;pect. On each &s;ide the vale, the hills tower in maje&s;ty and grandeur. I do not
<PB N="104" REF="115">
he&s;itate to prefer this &s;ituation and pro&s;pect, to that of the vale of Clwyd. Some even venture to affirm that it is not equalled by any in Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of Powis, and the fine gardens, are much neglected and decayed, as his lord|&s;hip does not re&s;ide here.</P>
<P>The hills and mountains in this county are covered with verdure to their very &s;um|mit, being a perfect contra&s;t to tho&s;e in the counties before de&s;cribed, where we &s;aw no|thing but craggy rocks, and dreadful preci|pices.</P>
<P>From Pool, we continued our journey through pretey fertile country, between the confines of England and Wales to O&s;we&s;try. In Wel&s;h it is called CROES-OSWOLT, i. e. O&s;wald's-cro&s;s. This was formerly e&s;teemed part of Wales, but now it is included in Shrop&s;hire. It is remarkable that the Wel&s;h language is &s;poken in many parts of Shrop|&s;hire, while it is almo&s;t entirely lo&s;t in Mont|gomery&s;hire.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="116">From O&s;we&s;try, we vi&s;ited Chirk-ca&s;tle, the &s;eat of Mr. Middleton. It has a mag|nificent appearance at a di&s;tance, but it is an ill-contrived hou&s;e in every point of view. The country round it is plea&s;ant, but upon the whole, it is not an agreeable &s;ituation.</P>
<P>A few miles from Chirk-ca&s;tle, is the vil|lage of Llangollen, in a bottom, &s;urrounded on every &s;ide with high hills. The village is remarkable for nothing but a fine bridge, e&s;teemed one of the curio&s;ities of Wales. The ca&s;tle of Dinas-bran, is on the &s;ummit of one of the hills, above the village. This ca&s;|tle belonged formerly to the princes of Powis|land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Powis, or Mathrafal, as it is called in Wel&s;h, before king Offa's time, reached ea&s;tward to the rivers Severn and Dee, from Broxen-hills to Salop. By the dyke it was contracted into a narrower compa&s;s. The plain country towards Salop, being inhabited by Saxons and Normans. The length was North-ea&s;t from Pulford to Llangirric-bridge, near Cardigan&s;hire, the breadth from Cefeilion to Elle&s;mere.</NOTE>. Dinas-bran, is I apprehend a cor|ruption of DINAS-BRENING, i. e. the re&s;idence of the king. The hill upon which the ca&s;tle
<PB N="106" REF="117">
&s;tands, is very high and &s;teep, and mu&s;t have been an almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible place. It has the appearance of great antiquity, being probably built by &s;ome of the fir&s;t Briti&s;h princes.</P>
<P>In our way to Wrexham, our curio&s;ity induced us to view Wynn&s;tay, the &s;eat of Sir Watkin Williams Wynne. The hou&s;e is incompleat in its &s;tructure, but the beauty of the &s;ituation exceeds de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The la&s;t place that we vi&s;ited in North-Wales was Wrexham, which is the riche&s;t and mo&s;t populous town in the whole coun|try. The only curio&s;ity that travellers re|mark in it is a fine &s;teeple, which is e&s;teemed one of the wonders of Wales.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this place are &s;o per|fectly Engli&s;hed, if I may u&s;e &s;uch an ex|pre&s;&s;ion, in their language, manners, and cu&s;|toms, that it bears no re&s;emblance to the generality of Wel&s;h towns.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE taken up my pen, with the view of making &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the an|cient and modern legal polity of the Wel&s;h.</P>
<P>Laws in every &s;tate, are multiplied in proportion to the opulence, the number, the trade, and the intercour&s;e of the inhabitants. Twelve tables contained the laws of Rome, when in its infant &s;tate; and the decalogue, was the foundation of the Jewi&s;h juri&s;pru|dence. The laws of opulent and commer|cial countries, &s;uch as England and China, are incredibly voluminous; whil&s;t tho&s;e of barbarous and uncivilized nations, may be compri&s;ed in a &s;hort compa&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="119">A legi&s;lator cannot form a code of laws, that will &s;erve the &s;tate in all exigencies, through &s;ucceeding generations. Human fore&s;ight cannot comprehend events that may happen; nor if fore&s;een, could it pro|vide again&s;t them. The ingenuity of man eludes every tie that is made to bind it. Hence new ca&s;es daily happen, which were never fore&s;een; and new mi&s;chiefs, again&s;t which the law has no guard; which mu&s;t be remedied by new laws, ex re nata. Thus they become &s;o multifarious, that it mu&s;t be the employment of a life to acquire a know|ledge of them.</P>
<P>Happy is that country of which it may be &s;aid, (as Tacitus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I never con&s;idered Tacitus's treati&s;e, De moribus Germanorum, intended as a real de&s;cription of the Germans&mdash;He drew the picture of a people, in man|ners perfectly contra&s;ted to the Romans, thereby aim|ing an oblique &s;atire again&s;t his countrymen.</NOTE> does in his admirable picture of the Germans) Plus ibi boni mores quam alibi bonae leges valent. Were mankind virtuous and ju&s;t, there would be no foren&s;ic

litigations; no occa&s;ion for the coif and long robe. Avarice and inju&s;tice are the offspring of riches, luxury, and vice; the&s;e introduced a nece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint upon human actions, which we call LAW.</P>
<P>In very early ages, before Chri&s;tianity was planted in Europe, the prie&s;ts or druids were judges and legi&s;lators among the Celtic nations. They decided in all controver&s;ies, both of a public and private nature. Refe|rences being at fir&s;t probably made to them, on account of their &s;anctity, and au&s;terity of manners; which gave &s;anction and weight to their deci&s;ions. We have the concurrent te&s;timony <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neque animadvertere, neque vincire, neque ver|berare, quidem ni&s;i &s;acerdotibus permi&s;&s;um&mdash;Taci|tus de m. Germ.

Si quis privatus aut publicus eorum decreto non obedierit &s;acrificiis interdicunt. Haec paena apud eos gravi&s;&s;ima. Quibus ita e&s;t interdictum impiorum habentur numero. Cae&s;ar de bello Gallico.</NOTE> of credible hi&s;torians, that this
<PB N="110" REF="121">
was the ca&s;e among the Germans and Gauls. And I think, there is little doubt, but the ancient Britons were a branch of the &s;ame people. A great &s;imiliarity may be traced in their manners, cu&s;toms and language.</P>
<P>In &s;o early a &s;tate of &s;ociety, when they had no riches, nor &s;carce an idea of di&s;tinct property, there could be but few cau&s;es of altercation and animo&s;ity. Their laws con|&s;i&s;ted of a few oral and traditional precepts, not reduced to writing, but committed only to the memory.</P>
<P>The brea&s;t of the druid was the repo&s;itory of their laws. The court of judicature was &s;ituated on the mo&s;t con&s;picuous eminence, in the open air. Here the cau&s;es were tried, and judgment pronounced. The remains of many of the&s;e judgment &s;eats I have &s;een, which are &s;till called by that name in the Wel&s;h language ORSEDDE. I &s;hall here give a &s;hort de&s;cription of their ancient courts of judicature, with an account of their manner of proceeding, which may not prove unen|tertaining.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="122">Their &s;eats of judgment or juridical courts con&s;i&s;ted of two circumvallations of a cir|cular form, one comprehended within the other. The centre was rai&s;ed, and &s;eems to have been the place where the judge &s;at. The inner circumvallation was intended for the parties and witne&s;&s;es, and the outer for the multitude.</P>
<P>In early times, as I have before ob&s;erved, the druids were the only judges. But after the planting of Chri&s;tianity, and the people being &s;omewhat more civilized, the laws which were before merely oral became re|duced into writing, and a regular code was formed by Howel Dha, or the good. We find at that time, that all matters of inheri|tance, were determined by the prince in per|&s;on; if not able to attend, by his deputy. The court con&s;i&s;ted of the freeholders of the place, two elders, the chief judge, and the ordinary judge of the court. The prince &s;at above, with an elder on each hand. The freeholders next, who then were and are &s;till

<P>The plaintiff, with his advocate (Rhyn|gill, wrangler, or if you will &s;erjeant) and champion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By this it appears that in &s;ome ca&s;es, trial by bat|tle was in u&s;e among the ancient Britons, as it was among all the Northern nations.</NOTE> on the left &s;ide; and the defen|dant, with his advocate and champion on the right. The witne&s;&s;es were placed at the lower end.</P>
<P>For what purpo&s;e the freeholders were pre&s;ent in court, is not clear. It does not appear that they were called in to act as a jury. Though it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e &s;o; as the trial by jury was u&s;ed among all the Gothic nations. The chief, the com|mon judge, and prie&s;t gave judgment; but in matters of difficulty and importance, the definitive &s;entence was pronounced by the prince, with the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the elders.</P>

They de&s;cend to take notice of even the minute&s;t circum&s;tances, and are perhaps the be&s;t proof of the uncultivated and barbarous di&s;|po&s;ition of the inhabitants. To produce in|&s;tances to corroborate what I have a&s;&s;erted, would be needle&s;s; for the whole code is probably the &s;trange&s;t collection of juri&s;pru|dence that ever was compo&s;ed for the go|vernment of any people.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was likewi&s;e very much the ca&s;e in England at that time, for we find the barons waging war again&s;t each other without the royal a&s;&s;ent.</NOTE> a&s;&s;ert, that the ancient in|habitants of Wales were of &s;uch an inflexible refractory di&s;po&s;ition, that they would hardly &s;ubmit to any law.

parts of Wales, but even private per|&s;ons, waged open public ho&s;tilities again&s;t each other. Encroachments on each others e&s;tates, family quarrels, and affronts, fur|ni&s;hed ample pretexts for taking arms. So &s;trong were their pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;o weak was law.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of gavelkind contributed in a great degree to promote the&s;e hereditary feuds. Sovereignties, as well as the e&s;tates of private per&s;ons, were divided among all the male i&s;&s;ue, legitimate, as well as illegi|timate. This was the perpetual &s;ource of civil wars and private di&s;&s;entions. Upon the death of the prince, all the &s;ons claimed a right to the &s;overeignty; and, as among the A&s;iatic nations, the longe&s;t &s;word e&s;tabli&s;hed the claim. Sometimes they agreed to divide the &s;overeignty between the &s;ons. Nothing could tend more to weaken the country, and render them unable to repel foreign incur|&s;ions, than the cu&s;tom of gavelkind, when applied to the government.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="126">The equal partition of private e&s;tates among&s;t the male i&s;&s;ue, tends to promote population and cultivation of the land. In a government founded on equality and liber|ty, it is the means of curtailing the wealth and power of individuals, and reducing man|kind more to a &s;tate of natural equality. By nature all the i&s;&s;ue female, as well as male, have certainly a right to an equal &s;hare of their ance&s;tor's property. The preference given to the elde&s;t is artificial, introduced by law, and not by nature. The cu&s;tom of lands de&s;cending to the younge&s;t &s;on, which we call borough-Engli&s;h, in preference to the other &s;ons, &s;eems to have a &s;tronger foundation in rea&s;on, than the exclu&s;ive de|&s;cendibility to the elde&s;t; or, as it is called, the right of primogeniture; the elde&s;t being &s;uppo&s;ed more capable of providing for him|&s;elf, on account of his more advanced age, than the younge&s;t; who probably might be of &s;uch tender years, as to be altogether un|able to provide for him&s;elf, on his ance&s;tors decea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="127">This law of gavelkind was univer&s;al, in Great-Britain, before the Norman conque&s;t; and remained in Wales, till the time of Henry VIII. when the union commenced.</P>
<P>There is the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to think, that the feudal &s;y&s;tem never was adopted in Wales. There are no traces of it remaining, that I could di&s;cover. In the three mo&s;t northern counties they have no manors, nor mane|rial courts or rights; nor any copyhold te|nures, or the lea&s;t remains of any of the con&s;equences of feudal tenures.</P>
<P>In the counties bordering upon England, as I have before ob&s;erved, &s;ome of the kings of the Norman line made large grants of lands, in order to keep the Wel&s;h in &s;ub|jection. In the&s;e territories, which they had by grant from the crown, they held courts; which are &s;till kept by pre&s;cription. Here, indeed, there are &s;ome appearances of the feudal &s;y&s;tem; but it mu&s;t be remem|bered, that even the&s;e few ve&s;tiges are the remains of the Norman policy, and make no part of the ancient Briti&s;h con&s;titution.
<PB N="117" REF="128">
We may, therefore, conclude with certainty that the feudal &s;y&s;tem was never adopted among the ancient Britons, or Wel&s;h; and was probably never known in this i&s;land, until the Norman conque&s;t.</P>
<P>The princes of Wales had a legi&s;lative power. We do not find that they had any kind of parliament. They could alter, abro|gate and enact laws without advice, accord|ing to their own will and plea&s;ure. In the exerci&s;e of this power, it was their intere&s;t to act conformably to the public good; for if they di&s;plea&s;ed their &s;ubjects, their di&s;appro|bation was &s;hewn not by vain ineffectual PETITIONS, but by the &s;word. Petition is a word coined among &s;laves, unknown to the ancient Britons. In this country, as it ought to be in every other; WHEN THE SOVEREIGN CEASED TO BE DESERVING OF HIS CROWN, HE CEASED TO BE A KING.</P>

<P>When Edward I. had brought Wales into &s;ubjection to the crown of England; his next care was to regulate the laws and judicial proceedings.

<PB N="120" REF="131">
he was thereby rendered incapable of enjoying any office.</P>
<P>In the time of Henry IV. a mo&s;t excellent regulation was made to prevent idle rhymers, min&s;trals and vagabonds, from going about the country begging. This has been looked upon by &s;ome to be a &s;evere law, and a grievance to the country; but the lea&s;t re|flection will convince them, that it was a mo&s;t whol&s;ome regulation.</P>
<P>In the time of Henry VIII. the act of union of England and Wales, and ordinances pa&s;&s;ed for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in the principality. Some authors of great learn|ing have (I &s;peak with deference to &s;o great authority) I think, very improperly called this act a complete Code of Regulations for the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice. Whoever will give him&s;elf the trouble of con&s;idering, with the lea&s;t degree of attention, the mode of judicial proceedings in Wales, compared to that in England, mu&s;t immediately acknow|ledge the great &s;uperiority of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="132">It is true, they have in Wales what is very improperly called the court of grand &s;e&s;&s;ions. Here is tran&s;acted both chancery and common law bu&s;ine&s;s. In one of my excur&s;ions, I happened accidentally to be pre&s;ent at their courts. I reque&s;ted &s;ome information concerning their proceedings of a gentleman who &s;at next me; who &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity in the following terms. <Q REND="inline">"The import of your que&s;tion, Sir, &s;aid he, de|notes you to be a &s;tranger; and I am glad it is in my power to give you the information you require. You have heard, the judge make a very elaborate &s;peech to the jury; but not one of them are capable of com|prehending the meaning of a &s;yllable of it. All our common people are ignorant of the Engli&s;h language; and we are never allowed &s;pecial juries to try cau&s;es in Wales. Where the cau&s;e of action is above ten pounds, the parties may bring it to trial to the next Eng|li&s;h county. Thus are we frequently obliged, at great expence and trouble, to bring wit|ne&s;&s;es at a hundred miles di&s;tance to try a

trifling cau&s;e; and the more opulent have it always in their power to harra&s;s one who is le&s;s able to bear the expence. By this means what was originally intended as a benefit to the country, is become a grievance. And as the rea&s;on for trying cau&s;es in the next Engli&s;h county has cea&s;ed, which was to procure a more impartial trial, on account of the party faction which generally prevailed in Wales, &s;o ought the practice to cea&s;e like|wi&s;e. The &s;ame judicial proceedings ought to take place here as in England; and it would be more beneficial for the country, if Wales was joined to the Engli&s;h circuits. Thus there would be no partial di&s;tinction be|tween the inhabitants of England and Wales. We &s;hould have the &s;ame laws, the &s;ame ju&s;|tice, the &s;ame government, and in time, the &s;ame language."</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DURING my continuance in this coun|try, I have had the curio&s;ity to enquire into their police, and the execution of the law. Great is the di&s;content of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part of the inhabitants, on account of the defective enforcement of the law. Crimes of the blacke&s;t dye, frequently pa&s;s unob&s;erved; or if ob&s;erved, unpuni&s;hed. Some might infer a conclu&s;ion from hence, that the laws of England do not extend to this rugged &s;pot, or that the inhabitants are too refractory to be governed by law. The former is not the ca&s;e, whatever foundation there may be for the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="136">It may be &s;aid in general, that the law is very defectively enforced in Wales; and &s;ome laws have never been adopted, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, into that country. In the three mo&s;t northern counties, the laws re|&s;pecting the game, and tho&s;e re&s;pecting the &s;ettlement and maintenance of the poor, have never been put into execution.</P>
<P>The game laws are re&s;trictive of the natu|ral rights of mankind, and made for the be|nefit of a few individuals, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the favors of fortune. Tho&s;e for who&s;e ad|vantage they were enacted, have alone a right to enforce them, and they have a right like|wi&s;e to di&s;pen&s;e with the execution of their own exclu&s;ive privileges. Let them enjoy the prai&s;e they de&s;erve for &s;o meritorious and di&s;intere&s;ted a conduct.</P>
<P>The laws relating to the poor, are far from being included under the &s;ame predicament. By not enforcing them, they do not di&s;pen&s;e with their own privileges, but abrogate the rights of others, the mo&s;t helple&s;s part of mankind. It is an advantage enjoyed in &s;o|ciety,
<PB N="126" REF="137">
that every individual, who by accident or &s;ickne&s;s is rendered incapable of main|taining him&s;elf, has a right to a provi&s;ion at the public expence. The rights of huma|nity demand a &s;upport for the poor, the laws of this country have provided it; and the neglect of enforcing them, is a &s;hocking breach of every obligation, legal, moral, and religious.</P>
<P>Let not the&s;e &s;trangers to the rights of humanity, as well as the laws of their coun|try, argue that the hand of charity is muni|ficently extended to relieve di&s;tre&s;s; but the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed have not always the ability to undergo the fatigues of a mendicant erratic life. It is not in the power of one, depre&s;&s;ed with the heavy burden of four&s;core years, to wander a de&s;olate country to &s;eek exi&s;tence. When he hath &s;pent his youthful morning and noon, in labor and the &s;ervice of &s;ociety, &s;ome &s;upport is due to him, in the evening of life. It is &s;aid, that in&s;tances are not wanting of &s;ome, who peri&s;h through want. Are not their unfortunate ends to be imputed to tho&s;e,
<PB N="127" REF="138">
who are delegated to enforce the laws. How|ever &s;uperficially I may be acquainted with this country, I have rea&s;on to think that &s;o heavy a charge is not de&s;titute of foundation.</P>
<P>Is it then for want of charity, that &s;uch in&s;tances happen? no: the hand of charity is not cold. She is &s;eldom &s;olicited in vain. It is on account of the inability of the object to &s;eek relief, and not their unwillingne&s;s in granting it.</P>
<P>It is by &s;ome a&s;&s;erted, that if the poor were maintained by parochial rates, it would en|courage idlene&s;s, and that many would throw them&s;elves upon the pari&s;h, who could main|tain them&s;elves by labor. I would deny this deduction.</P>
<P>Now tho&s;e alone are capable of receiving the alms of charity, who are able to main|tain them&s;elves. The old, the &s;ick and de|cripit, are not able, like the healthy and &s;trong, to &s;eek a precarious exi&s;tence, by roving about the country for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The alms given to vagrants, of whom they
<PB N="128" REF="139">
have no knowledge, would more than &s;up|port &s;uch as are really indigent.</P>
<P>If each pari&s;h or di&s;trict was to maintain its own poor, work might be found for &s;uch as were capable of working; and it would be more profitable for the farmer to furni&s;h them with employment, than to maintain them in idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>Some perhaps may argue, that in many parts of England, great abu&s;es have crept into the execution of the poor laws, and con|clude that therefore they ought not to be en|forced in Wales. It cannot be denied, but that the wi&s;e&s;t human in&s;titution may be per|verted. We ought rather to con&s;ider the advantages that may be derived from their proper execution, than the abu&s;es re&s;ulting from their improper enforcement.</P>
<P>In large populous manufacturing towns and countries, the poor are very numerous. This may be as much owing to their luxu|rious manner of life, as to the number of inhabitants. In Wales there are compara|tively
<PB N="129" REF="140">
few that &s;tand in need of charity; and their number would be greatly dimini&s;hed, if proper means were u&s;ed to excite indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The lands are uncultivated, the wool un|manufactured. Here would be employment as well for the youth and the aged, as tho&s;e in the vigor of life; many of whom, to the di&s;grace of the country, wander about beg|ging and pilfering. The means perhaps the mo&s;t effectual to provide for the poor, would be to erect a workhou&s;e in every county for the infirm and aged. Thus would charity be properly and effectually applied, beggary eradicated, and indu&s;try encouraged.</P>
<P>The care of doing this is incumbent upon tho&s;e that are delegated to enforce the laws of their country. Were I to addre&s;s them, it would be to diver&s;t them&s;elves of the pre|judices they have imbibed. To &s;hew by their conduct, that they enjoy their offices, neither for emolument, or gratification of vanity; that their attention is not &s;olely confined to the indulgence of their plea&s;ures, and that
<PB N="130" REF="141">
the welfare of their country is at lea&s;t a &s;e|condary con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I have now, Sir, fini&s;hed all I have to &s;ay of this country, except &s;ome ob&s;ervations on its hi&s;tory, which &s;hall be the &s;ubject of &s;ome future letters.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL nations boa&s;t of their high de&s;cent and origin. Some have traced their genealogies from heroes and demigods, others from the gods them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It would be a matter of wonder, if this na|tion, proverbially remarked for their pedi|grees, &s;hould not put in an equal claim to antiquity and high de&s;cent. Accordingly, their hi&s;torians affirm with great gravity, that they are de&s;cended from one Brutus, the &s;on of Silvius, &s;on of the godde&s;s-born, pious Aeneas.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee how ea&s;ily they trace their pedigrees from Venus and old father Jupiter.
<PB N="132" REF="143">
To prove this genealogy, they &s;ay, that Bru|tus and Britains are &s;o very &s;imilar, that the latter mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be derived from the former.</P>
<P>Other hi&s;torians a&s;&s;ert, with no le&s;s confi|dence, that they are de&s;cended in a direct line from Gomer, from whom they are called Cymry; thus gratifying their vanity at the expence of their under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Let their genealogi&s;ts &s;eek for their origin with as little &s;ucce&s;s, as they would the foun|tain of the Nile. It will be &s;ufficient for us to determine that they are a branch of the ancient Celts. This is evident to demon&s;tra|tion, from their manners, cu&s;toms, and lan|guage.</P>
<P>It is probable that they emigrated in colo|nies from the continent to &s;eek &s;ettlements; and were the only inhabitants of this i&s;land, till they were fir&s;t conquered by the Romans, afterwards by the Saxons, when they were obliged to take refuge in the mo&s;t remote and inacce&s;&s;ible parts of the country. It is probable, from the Celtic words now in com|mon
<PB N="133" REF="144">
u&s;e in tho&s;e counties, that many of them continued to re&s;ide in Cornwal, and the north of England, long after the Saxon conque&s;t. But they have for &s;ome ages been incorpo|rated with the Engli&s;h, &s;o that &s;carce any ve&s;|tiges can be traced of their different origin. In Wales they have had but little intercour&s;e with foreigners, by which means they &s;till continue a di&s;tinct people.</P>
<P>A minute detail of all the wars and depre|dations of the Wel&s;h and Engli&s;h, from the aera of the Saxon conque&s;t to the time of Ed|ward I. would be as unimportant as tho&s;e of the different tribes of Indians. Their wars were equally bloody, and both nations in tho&s;e times were as &s;avage and ferocious. Each, as the &s;cale of fortune preponderated, filled the others territories with ma&s;&s;acres and de|va&s;tation, and de&s;troyed with fire and &s;word.</P>
<P>Such hi&s;tories di&s;grace the annals of huma|nity, and had better been left unrecorded.</P>
<P>What I propo&s;e in this and my next letter, is only to draw the mo&s;t remarkable outlines of the hi&s;tory of Wales.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="145">Cadwalader was the la&s;t of the ancient Bri|ti&s;h kings who reigned in England; being driven out by the Saxons, he took refuge in Armorica, or Little Britain, in France, where a colony of Britains were then &s;ettled.</P>
<P>From the time of the Saxon inva&s;ion, to Rhyddarch or Roderick the great, as he is called, the Britains had no &s;ettled govern|ment, but were ruled by &s;everal petty kings or lords, of whom nothing very memorable is related. Roderick was king of all Wales, which he divided between his three &s;ons; North-Wales to his elde&s;t, South-Wales to the &s;econd, and Powis-land to the third, with an injunction that they &s;hould owe allegiance to the elde&s;t.</P>
<P>This divi&s;ion of Wales continued not long, for it was again united under Howel Dha, or the good, who was grand&s;on to Roderick. He is di&s;tingui&s;hed with the eminent title of the good, as he was the great Lycurgus of Wales. The code of laws which he collected for them are &s;till extant, of which I have taken &s;ome notice in a former letter.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="146">After the death of Howel Dha, Wales was again divided ihto three parts, and continued &s;o to its conque&s;t by Edward I. without much interruption. This want of policy in divid|ing the principality, was the chief &s;ource of all their misfortunes. Di&s;tracted by civil commotions, they were unable to repel the attacks of the Danes by &s;ea, and the Engli&s;h by land.</P>
<P>During the interval between the time of Howel Dha and Gruffyth ap Llewelyn, we read of nothing very memorable, except in|te&s;tine commotions, and inva&s;ions by the Danes, to whom they were compelled to pay tribute.</P>
<P>Gruffyth ap Llewelyn reduced all Wales under &s;ubjection to him. He was very &s;uc|ce&s;sful in his wars again&s;t the Engli&s;h, in the time of Edward the confe&s;&s;or. He is the fir&s;t, if not the only one of the Wel&s;h kings, that had a navy; and is highly celebrated for his, power and valour by the Wel&s;h hi&s;|torians. Harold, the Engli&s;h general, pro|voked by the continual incur&s;ions and de|predations
<PB N="136" REF="147">
made by Gruffydd in the frontier Engli&s;h counties, fell upon him unprepared, and obliged him to fly abroad, leaving his country naked and defencele&s;s. The enemy conquered the greate&s;t part of Wales in the ab&s;ence of Gruffydd, and left monuments of their victories, with this in&s;cription, <Q REND="inline">"Hic fuit victor Haraldus."</Q> We are told by Gi|raldus Cambren&s;is, that the&s;e monuments were extant in his time. But as I have before ob|&s;erved, the veracity of the&s;e monki&s;h hi&s;to|rians is not always to be credited.</P>
<P>When Gruffydd returned, after this ba&s;e de&s;ertion of his country, they were &s;o ju&s;tly irritated at his conduct, that they beheaded him as a traitor, and &s;ent his head to Ha|rold.</P>
<P>William the conqueror marched with a powerful army into Wales, which &s;o intimi|dated them, that they were kept in &s;ubjection during the whole of his reign. In the time of the conqueror and William Rufus, many &s;ettlements were made in Wales by the Nor|mans. A plan, which, if it had been tho|roughly
<PB N="137" REF="148">
executed, mu&s;t have effectually kept the Wel&s;h in &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e was Roger de Montgomery, earl of Arundel and Shrew&s;bury, who took the town and ca&s;tle of Baldwyn, and called it by the name of Montgomery, which it has re|tained to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>Gruffyth ap Conan, who was at this time king of North-Wales, in conjunction with the princes of South-Wales, falling upon the Normans, routed them with great havoc, and de&s;troyed their ca&s;tles and two large armies, which William Rufus rai&s;ed again&s;t them. Gruffydd ap Conan was afterwards compelled by Henry I. to &s;ubmit to him, and make com|pen&s;ation for the ravages he had committed in England. In the time of king Stephen, he took advantage of the civil wars then in England, when he and his &s;ons committed great depradations and &s;laughter on the Nor|mans who were &s;ettled in Wales. After a reign of fifty years, Gruffydd ap Conan died. He was revered and beloved by his &s;ubjects, and dignified, on account of his valor and vic|tories,
<PB N="138" REF="149">
with the di&s;tingui&s;hing title of the Defence and Shield of Wales.</P>
<P>Upon the death of Gruffydd, his territories were divided between his &s;ons, according to the cu&s;tom of Wales, who owed allegiance to the elde&s;t, Owen Gwynedd. Owen was the fir&s;t who had the title of prince of North-Wales, before his time they were all called kings. He was a man of a martial, but &s;a|vage di&s;po&s;ition. In the&s;e barbarous times, as in the modern A&s;iatic nations, ca&s;tration and lo&s;s of eyes was often the hard fate of &s;uch as had the misfortune to be related to the reigning prince. A puni&s;hment which Owen inflicted on his nephew Cunethe, &s;on to his brother Cadwalhon.</P>
<P>He u&s;ed his relations with great inju&s;tice and cruelty. His brother Cadwalhon he de|prived of his e&s;tates, and forced to fly abroad, and &s;eek a&s;ylum with Henry II. At the in|&s;tigation of Cadwalhon, Henry made two or three expeditions into Wales; in which he was generally un&s;ucce&s;sful, owing to the &s;i|tuation
<PB N="139" REF="150">
of the country, of which Owen always took advantage.</P>
<P>After Owen Gwynedd's death, his elde&s;t &s;on, Jorwerth Drwyndwn, i. e. Edward the no&s;ele&s;s, was &s;et a&s;ide as improper to govern, on account of that defect; and the govern|ment devolved to his brother, David ap Owen, who was afterwards dethroned by Llewelyn, &s;on to Jorwerth Drwyndwn. Madoc, the younge&s;t &s;on of Owen Gwynedd, it is &s;aid by the Wel&s;h hi&s;torians, went abroad and di&s;co|vered the continent of America, that part of it which is called Florida. Upon his making this di&s;covery, he returned to Wales, and car|ried away a colony of his countrymen to make a &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>This improbable &s;tory is univer&s;ally be|lieved among the Wel&s;h at this time; and in confirmation of the truth of it, they &s;ay, that the Wel&s;h language is &s;till &s;poken among &s;ome of the Indian tribes, who are the de&s;cendants of this Madoc ap Owen Gwynedd. Thus do the Wel&s;h arrogate to them&s;elves the ho|nor
<PB N="140" REF="151">
of the fir&s;t di&s;covery of America, in pre|ference to the great Columbus.</P>
<P>Under the conduct of Llewelyn ap Jor|werth, and his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, David ap Llewelyn, the Wel&s;h carried on war with va|rious &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the Engli&s;h. Defeating them in &s;kirmi&s;hes, and falling upon them unawares in narrow pa&s;&s;es; and when defeated, flying for refuge to their natural impregnable fortre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd &s;ucceeded his un|cle, David ap Llewelyn; and was the la&s;t prince of Wales of Briti&s;h blood. He was &s;lain unarmed in Buelt-wood, where he had retired to meet &s;ome lords of the country; and his head was put on the tower of Lon|don. Thus were the Wel&s;h at la&s;t con|quered by Edward I. after they had main|tained their independence for &s;o many cen|turies.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER the tragical end of prince Llewelyn, the politic kind Edward took every prudent mea&s;ure to &s;ecure his conque&s;t. He granted lands in Wales to his followers, thereby incorporating the Engli&s;h with his new &s;ubjects. The woods, which &s;erved as fa&s;tne&s;&s;es to &s;ecure and conceal the enemy, he ordered to be de&s;troyed; and cau&s;ed &s;everal &s;trong ca&s;tles, which I have before de&s;cribed, to be built; and garri&s;oned them to keep the country in &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>The Wel&s;h having experienced the cruelty and rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of the Engli&s;h governors,
<PB N="143" REF="154">
were unwilling to &s;ubmit to Edward, and called upon him to give them a prince, a native of their country. We are informed by hi&s;torians, that for this purpo&s;e he &s;ent his queen to Carnarvon-ca&s;tle, where &s;he was delivered of Edward II. who had the title of prince of Wales conferred upon him; there|by complying with the literal import of their reque&s;t, at the &s;ame time that he avoided the &s;pirit and intention of it.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this politic conce&s;&s;ion, and the more prevailing argument of force, which the Engli&s;h u&s;ed; many of the Wel&s;h, from the hopes of plunder or antipathy to their conquerors, were &s;till inclined to com|mit outrages. There were many in&s;urrec|tions in Wales, after the death of prince Llewelyn, which were &s;oon quelled. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable was that of Owen Glyndowr, who was &s;o called from the lord&s;hip of Glyn|dowrdy, his real name was Owen ap Gryf|fydd Vaughan.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this in&s;urrection was an en|mity that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Owen and Regi|nald
<PB N="144" REF="155">
lord Grey of Rhythin, on account of &s;ome incroachments, which Reginald made on the lord&s;hip of Glyndowrdy.</P>
<P>Owen, had received his education in the inns of court, and was in great favor with Richard II. When Richard was depo&s;ed, he lo&s;t his e&s;tate at court; and Reginald lord Grey, pre&s;uming on this, encroached upon his lands. Owen made application to par|liament for relief, which proved ineffectual; and when the bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph acquainted the parliament of the danger of irritating the Wel&s;h, they returned this haughty an&s;wer, Se de illis &s;curris nudipedibus nil curare.</P>
<P>Owen, not meeting with redre&s;s from the parliament, had recour&s;e to arms, took Regi|nald pri&s;oner, and de&s;troyed the lord&s;hip of Rhythin.</P>
<P>This &s;ucce&s;s induced many to follow Owen's fortunes, he afterwards gained a com|pleat victory over lord March and the Here|ford&s;hire men. Lord March was taken pri|&s;oner, by Owen, in this battle, and upon ap|plication being made to Henry IV. he refu&s;ed
<PB N="145" REF="156">
to pay his ran&s;om. Irritated by this, lord March joined with Owen, and they entered into a confederacy with the earls of Northum|berland and Worce&s;ter again&s;t king Henry, and it is &s;aid, that they even &s;igned deeds to divide the kingdom. Henry had the good fortune to defeat the de&s;igns of this powerful confederacy, for he attacked them at Shrew&s;|bury, before all their forces were joined, and gained a compleat victory over them. The battle of Hu&s;ke afterwards, put an end to Owen's a&s;piring hopes and the lives of fif|teen hundred Wel&s;hmen, who were killed on the field of battle. This was the la&s;t &s;trug|gle, and un&s;ucce&s;sful effort, made by the Wel&s;h, for the recovery of their liberties. The Engli&s;h now having entirely &s;ubjected them, treated them rather as &s;laves than &s;ubjects. They were prohibited from enjoy|ing any offices, purcha&s;ing any lands, and even penal laws were enacted to prevent the Engli&s;h from intermarrying with them. Thus did the Engli&s;h parliament rather widen the breach which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two na|tions,
